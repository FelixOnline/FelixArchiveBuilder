A meme\nthat started out in 2005 as\na form of internet humour,\nmainly used across the\nnetherworld of 4chan,\nby last year, the image\nhad been appropriated\nby a number of alt-right\ngroups. Today, the AntiDefamation League, an\ninternational organisation\nthat have historically\nopposed the KKK and the\nGerman-American Bund\nof the 1930s, lists Pepe as\na general symbol of hate.\nPepe, and its associated\nalt-right movement, also\ndid the unthinkable, and\nhelped propel a Wotsit-orange political dilettante,\nwho had openly bragged\nabout being a sexual\npredator, into the White\nHouse. It is impossible\nto say whether memes\nwere what determined\nlast year\u2019s presidential\nelection, but it is certain\nthat memes and meme\nculture will forever be\ninextricably linked to the\nstrange turn of events of\nthe months leading up to\nNovember 2016.\nMemes as Resistance\nIf 2016 was the year\nmemes determined political outcomes, 2017\nshows us what happens\nwhen nihilistic internet\nhumour comes up against\nthe harsh reality of political power. Trump\u2019s\npresidency has thus far\nbeen a veritable goldmine\nfor meme creators \u2013 a\nsentence nobody could\nhave predicted being\nwritten.\nEverything about\nhis presidency has\nmemetic potential: from\n#FreeMelania, which\nspread after a video of\nMelania Trump looking\nless-than-thrilled at the\ninauguration emerged,\nand competed for space\nwith other inauguration\nmemes, such as Michelle\nObama doing a Jim Carrey-style side-look to the\ncamera after being handed\na gift from the new First\nLady; through to his\nelaborate water break last\nmonth during a speech\nabout his visit to Asia.\nIn some ways, the\ncreation of memes can\nbe seen as a form of\nresistance against Trump,\nan attempt to take him\ndown a peg, and remind\neveryone that he really is\njust an enormous joke. If\nmemes allowed the demagogic man-child into the\nPresidency, they seem to\nsay, memes are what will\nallow us to live under his\nrule. In a TIME magazine\narticle from May, for\nexample, it was revealed\nthat when Trump served\ndessert to his guests,\n\u201che gets two scoops of\nvanilla ice cream with\nhis chocolate cream pie,\ninstead of the single scoop\nfor everyone else\u201d. Such\nmeme fodder was quickly\npicked up by the online\ncommunity, who used it\nto imply that Trump has\na similar mentality to a\nfive-year-old child.\nThis function, of\nmemes-as-resistance, can\nperhaps best be seen in\nthe short boom and bust\nmeme cycle of \u2018Covfefe\u2019:\njust after midnight at\nthe end of May, Trump\ntweeted \u201cdespite the\nconstant negative press\ncovfefe\u201d without any ex-Trump followed it up with\n\u201cWho can figure out the\ntrue meaning of \u201ccovfefe\u201d\n??? Enjoy!\u201d And just like\nthat, after having gained\nacknowledgement from\nthe very person it was\nsupposed to be making\nfun of, the meme was\ndead. For Trump memes\nto function, it seems\nto suggest, the subject\ncannot engage with them.\nThese are only a few\nexamples of what a gift\nTrump\u2019s presidency has\nbeen for meme makers.\nBut what does this desire\nto create humour from\nhis actions mean? Some\nof the memes that have\nbeen created were done so\nfollowing behaviour that\nwould be \u2013 in any normal\ndemocracy \u2013 completely\nabhorrent. We\u2019ve had\nTrump tossing paper\ntowels to victims of hurricane victims in Puerto\nRico \u2013 a territory still\nreeling from the disaster\nwhile Congress discuss\ntax cuts for the rich \u2013\nand Kellyanne Conway\ndiscuss \u201calternative facts\u201d\nwith grave seriousness,\nwhilst propagating lies\nabout fictional terrorist\nattacks. You\u2019ve got to\nmeme, otherwise you\u2019ll\ncry.\nThe Rise of Meta\nMemes\nOver the past few years,\nmemes have become\nincreasingly complex\nand self-referential, with\nsome memes packing in\nseveral layers of meaning\ninto a single image \u2013 like\na modern update of Elizabethan portraiture. In\n2017, this was perhaps\nbest exemplified by the\nDistracted Boyfriend\nmeme. Based off a stock\nimage showing a man\nturning to appreciate a\nwoman in a red dress,\nwhile his appalled girlfriend looks on, the meme\nquickly took off, with\nMad Men crossed with Trump memes // Twitter\nYeah... 100k people are interested // Facebook\n\u201cEverything\nabout Trump\u2019s\npresidency\nhas memetic\npotential\nfor online\ncommunities\u201d\nplanation, leading some to\npresume that he\u2019d either\nhad a stroke or had his\nphone knocked out of his\nhand by an aide who has\nhad enough of his online\ndiatribes. The tweet stayed\nup for around six hours,\nby which time it had set\nthe internet alight, with\nnumerous parodies inserting the word into scenes\nfrom film and TV shows.\nAt 6:07am, however,\nmemes managed to bring us all together at last\n\u201cWhen your\nfriends in New\nYork laugh\nat\u2018The Ting\nGoes\u2019, are they\nlaughing at the\nsame thing?\u201d\ncontent creators attributing various characters\nand themes to the three\n\u2018characters\u2019 (my personal\nfavourite came from\nPenguin Random House,\nwith the guy eschewing\n\u201cknowing when to use a\nsemicolon\u201d for \u201cem dash\u201d\n\u2013 far too relatable).\nWhat set this meme\napart, however, was\nthe way users enabled\nthe meme to keep on\ndelivering: today, in our\nconstantly-online world,\nthe lifespan of a meme has\nconsiderably diminished,\nto the point where 24\nhours can be enough for\none to run its course. What\nmade the Distracted Boyfriend meme different,\nhowever, was users discovering different stock\nimages from the same\nshoot, combining memes\ntogether, and using the\nmeme itself to poke fun at\nthe intrinsically transient\nnature of the form.\nAs time went on,\nthe layers of the meme\nkept on building up, as\nusers created loops of\nregression, flipped image\nformats, and created their\nown narratives. Really,\nthe Distracted Boyfriend\nmeme showed what\nmemes can do best: bring\npeople together, to create\ntheir own stories, if only\nfor a short time.\nBringing us Together\nThis use of memes to\nbring people together can\nalso be seen in the rise\nin event-based memes\nthat we\u2019ve had over the\nlast year. Numerous\nmeme-makers have been\nusing Facebook events\nto propagate particular\nmemes, such as the song\n\u2018Africa\u2019 by Toto, or\nsimply to get people to say\nthey\u2019re going to events\nthat have no purpose\nin the real world. This\nOctober, for example,\nStephanie Reid created\nan event called \u201cWindex\nthe Bean\u201d, inviting\nChicago natives to clean\nAnish Kapoor\u2019s famous\nsculpture Cloud Gate.\nThe event description\nread \u201cThe Bean is dirty\u201d.\nSuch events can often\nspread like wildfire along\nsocial media networks,\nachieving hundreds if not\nthousands of attendees.\nIt\u2019s a phenomenon\nsome Imperial students\nhave experience of: just\na couple of weeks ago,\nthe Imperial meme page\nMemeperial created an\nevent for \u201cPrince Harry\u2019s\nStag Do\u201d, in collaboration\nwith a number of other\nmeme pages on Facebook.\nAt the time of writing, the\nevent has nearly 40,000\nattendees, with more\nthan 100,000 interested\nin attending. It reached\nsuch prominence, that\nBBC News reported on it,\nwhich they took time to\npoint out was \u201cnot in any\nway official\u201d.\nPaul Balaji, Imperial\u2019s\nmost meme-able student,\nwas the one running the\nevent page \u2013 why did he\ndo it? Speaking to Felix,\nhe tells us \u201cin the modern\nday of social media, a\nroyal wedding isn\u2019t just a\nnational celebration, but\nrather a global phenom-enon. Creating the event\nfelt like the right thing to\ndo \u2013 it was literally just a\nbit of banter at first. The\nmore it grew, the more\nI realised it would have\na life of its own, so I\nupdated the description to\nreflect that it would be an\ninternational celebration\nof love.\u201d\nThe Ting Goes...\nDo memes really have\nthe power to bring us all\ntogether? One of the most\nsuccessful memes this\nyear might prove that this\nis the case: at the end of\nAugust, Michael Dapaah\u2019s\nfictional rapper Big Shaq\nentered Fire in the Booth,\na regular show by BBC\nRadio 1Xtra DJ Charlie\nSloth. The result was a\n22-minute long video\nthat generated countless\nmemes, from \u201cman\u2019s not\nhot\u201d, through to \u201c2+2 is\n4, minus 1 that\u2019s 3, quick\nmaths\u201d and the iconic \u201cthe\nting goes skrrrahh\u201d.\nWhat makes this meme\nparticularly interesting,\nhowever, was the way it\nbroke the geographical\nboundaries implicit in\nits creation: Big Shaq is\nan example of a piece of\ncomedy that is extremely\nlocal, making cultural\nreferences rather specific\nto South London. From\nroadmen refusing to take\noff their jackets, to extremely poor freestyling,\neverything about his Fire\nin the Booth is steeped\nin London culture, which\nmakes it popularity all the\nmore beguiling.\nWhile the memes are\ncertainly more popular\nin the UK, they have\nalso spread across the\nworld, popping up in the\nUnited States as well. And\nas much as you would\nhope internet dwellers\nin California are able to\nunderstand the humour\nbeing used by Dapaah, it\u2019s\nonly too common to come\nacross people who don\u2019t\nunderstand that the whole\nthing is a joke: \u201chaha,\nhe\u2019s so bad at rapping\u201d,\nyou read in the YouTube\ncomments, as you bury\nyour face in your hands.\nBig Shaq can, in some\nways, highlight both the\npotential reach of a meme,\nand its potential limita-tions. While Stormzy\u2019s\nGang Signs and Prayer\nhit the top spot in the UK\nearlier this year \u2013 and\nwell-deservedly \u2013 it failed\nto make much of an impact\nin America, showing that\neven in a culture slowly\nbecoming more homoge-neous, there will be local\nvariants forming a cultural\ncontext in which memes\nare incredibly embedded.\nYour friends in New York\nmight be laughing along\nwith you as you show\nthem a \u2018The Ting Goes\u2019\nvideo that cuts to footage\nof Big Ben, but are they\ncoming from the same\npoint of view? Are they\nlaughing the same laugh?\nIt seems that while\nmemes are gradually\nbeing thrust more and\nmore into the spotlight,\nthey throw up more\nquestions than answers. I\nlook forward to the time\nin the near future when a\nnew generation of cultural\ntheorists will embrace\nthis new method of com-munication, exploring\nthe meaning behind the\nmeme \u2013 who will be the\nMargaret Mead of the\nmeme generation? Maybe\nyou and me.\nWay too real // Penguin\nWhen Metric tries to charge for their cloakroom // YouTube\n\n"

In\ntoday\u2019s world, departure\nand arrival times are not\ndecided by humans in\nApplied technologies\nprogram that helps reduce\nwait times as well as CO2\nemissions.\nApplying racing technologies to real-world\nprojects is a task that\nrequires a great deal of\ncooperation between\nwork groups as well as a\ndelicate approach to intellectual property laws and\nFormula 1 regulations.\nDuring McLaren F1\u2019s\nlatest visit to Imperial,\nI had the opportunity\nto speak to the team\u2019s\nCFD Methodology Team\nLeader Julian Hoessler,\nwho shed some light on\nthe challenges involved.\nTom: Current Formula\n1 cars use a great deal\nof carbon composites\nto produce a stronger yet lighter chassis.\nCan you see these advancements affecting\nroad cars in the near\nfuture?\nJulien: There are a few\ndifferent types of carbon\ncomposite plies we are\nlooking into for different\npurposes. For instance,\nthe wing needs to flex a\ncertain amount but not\nmore than that, so we go\nto quite extreme lengths to\nget just the right stiffness\nand that rotational stiff-ness. I don\u2019t know if those\nexact composites will be\nas beneficial in the automotive industry but they\nwill have properties that\ncould be useful in road\ncars. It would be the same\ntechnology, just used\ndifferently for different\nproblems.\nT: Are there any technological similarities\nbetween the hybrid\npowertrainsinMcLar-en Road Cars and the\nF1 cars?\nJ: Yes, the idea of the\nMcLaren P1 was to use a\nsimilar type of recovery\nsystem, but this is not\nsomething you\u2019ll necessarily see translated into\nregular road cars. For\ninstance, if you look at\nthe P1, we use the hybrid\nengine during gearshifts to\navoid losing time shifting\ngears. This is something\nyou\u2019ll never see in a\nstandard road car, it\u2019s all\nabout performance rather\nthen saving fuel, so it\u2019s\nexclusive to performance\ncars.\nIn an F1 car, you have\nthe ERS and the KERS.\nThings might change a\nlittle bit in 2020, because\nthey will simplify it a\nlittle bit and get rid of\nthe MGU-H. That would\nmake the cars a little bit\nmore similar to what you\nsee in standard road cars.\nT: What is the transfer of information\nbetween McLaren\nRacing and McLaren\nAppliedTechnologies\nlike?\nJ: Yes, there are a lot\nof things that are being\nshared. The composite\nchains are quite shared\nbetween the two teams.\nIn terms of technologies\nit\u2019s a bit different and it\u2019s\nmostly because of Intellectual Property. Basically, Intellectual Property\ncontracts are much tighter\nin F1 compared to the\nautomotive industry.\nAlso, not everything we\ndevelop for F1 can be\napplied outside of the field\nto a completely different\nproduct. But there are\ntransfers of technology,\nthere are meetings of\ncourse. In terms of manu-facturing, however, there\nis much more sharing, especially in terms of actual\ndevelopment techniques.\nGrand Prix Racing is prohibitively expensive, top teams have budgets of around \u00a3400 million // McLaren\nconference rooms, but\nrather by clever software.\nHeathrow\u2019s scheduling,\nfor example, is decided\nsolely by a McLaren\n\u201cThe idea of\nthe McLaren\nP1 was to use\na similar type\nof recovery\nsystem [to that\nin F1]\u201d\nWhy your toothpatse, a Toyota Prius, and a McLaren\nA car is, ultimately, just a pile of steel and aluminum\nsteaming ahead faster than a cheetah. Yet this clumsy\ncontraption can come to a stop in little longer than\nthe 50-kilogram animal. Who do we have to thank\n\u2013 perhaps a safety officer in a lab coat? How about a\ngroup of seemingly suicidal individuals from the 1950s?\nTECH\nTom Mrazek\nTech Editor\n\u201cToothpaste\nproduction\nand Grand\nPrix racing\nseem about as\nunrelated as\ntwo fields can\npossibly be\u201d\nS\nteel disc brakes,\nlike many other\ntechnologies that\nmake today\u2019s cars\nso safe and efficient were\ndeveloped nowhere other\nthan on the racetrack.\nUntil a revised version\nof the Jaguar C-Type first\ntook to the track in 1953,\ndrum brakes were considered the only practical\nway of stopping a car.\nInitially, disc brakes were\n(literally) a hot mess that\nmelted on their drivers\nat the worst possible\ntimes. However, when\nall kinks were ironed out\ndisc brakes offered far\nshorter braking distances\nand allowed Jaguar to\nwin the 1953 24 Hours\nof Le Mans. In 1955 the\nmass-produced Citroen\nDS adopted disc brakes as\nwell and today you\u2019d be\nhard-pressed to find a car\nwithout them on the road.\nWhile steel disc brakes\nhave made their way\nto just about every car\nsold today, other technologies are only just\nnow beginning to impact\nyour average driver. For\ninstance, the carbon fiber\nchassis that made Formula\n1 slightly less dangerous\nin 1981 has recently been\nintroduced to the BMW\n7-series line. A carbon\nfiber chassis allows for\nlighter and therefore more\nfuel-efficient vehicles\nwhile offering uncompromising passenger\nsafety. Unfortunately,\nthe 7-series is priced at\nupwards of \u00a360,000, so\nit may be a few more\nyears before light-yet-safe\nconstructions become the\nnorm.\nMore promising\nadvancements are being\nmade in electric and\nhybrid powertrains,\nwhich are used not only\nin Formula 1, but also the\nWorld Endurance Championship and Formula E.\nThe current F1 engine\nformula encourages\nmanufacturers to research\nhybrid technology, resulting in small displacement\npower units with state-of-the-art energy recovery\nsystems that capture\nenergy under braking\nrather than dissipating it\nas heat \u2013 not too different\nfrom the way a Toyota\nPrius works (well, nearly\neight of them if power\noutput is considered).\nFormula E powertrains\nare even more interest-ing. With the addition\nof BMW and Nissan\njoining Audi and Jaguar\namong others for the 2018\nseason, the electric racing\nseries is bound to boost\nthe world\u2019s transition to\nelectric cars. Formula E\nteams all run the same\nchassis and aerodynamics\npackage, instead focusing\non developing more efficient electric motors.\nDue to the swift development pace, motorsport\nis an extremely high-budget venture as well\nas a fantastic innovation\nincubator and test bed.\nWhile most teams rely on\nsponsors to survive, some\nteams have chosen to use\nthe innovative environment to their advantage.\nThe most notable example\nof this is McLaren, whose\nApplied Technologies\nbranch is what makes your\ntoothpaste more high-tech\nthan you might expect.\nToothpaste production\nand Grand Prix racing\nseem about as unrelated as\ntwo fields can possibly be,\nyet McLaren\u2019s partnership\nwith GlaxoSmithKline\nproves that a successful\nFormula 1 team needs\nto understand so much\nmore than just how to run\na car around a track. The\nproducers of Aquafresh\nor Sensodyne, among\nother healthcare products,\napproached McLaren\nin 2011 with a task of\nmaking their production\nline more efficient.An odd\nquery considering GlaxoSmithKline produces\nmore toothpaste in a\nfew hours than McLaren\nhas produced cars in its\n55-year history. Yet when\nMcLaren used the same\ndata analysis techniques\nalready in place in\nFormula 1, they were able\nto immediately identify\nbottlenecks within GSK\u2019s\nproduction. The result of\nthe cooperation allows for\nan additional 6.7 million\ntubes of toothpaste\nproduced every year. The\nability to quickly and\nefficiently sort through\ndata is so critical in F1\nThe McLaren Technolgy Centre in Woking // McLaren\n\u201cThe result\nof GSK\u2019s and\nMcLaren\u2019s\ncooperation\nallows for an\nadditional\n6.7m tubes\nof toothpaste\nproduced\nevery year.\u201d\n\n"

Or to use as\nwrapping paper \u2013 it\u2019s what\nI\u2019m going to do, let\u2019s be\nhonest.\nTo say it\u2019s all Felix\nwould be a misnomer,\nhowever: this week we\u2019re\nsuper pleased to have the\nfirst edition of this year\u2019s\nPhoenix magazine, which\nhighlights art produced\nright here at Imperial. For\nmany students, Imperial\ncan seem like a dull, sterile\nplace, where you drag\nyourself out of bed for a\nmorning lecture during\nwhich neither yourself\nnor the lecturer are paying\nattention, and then cram a\nLibrary Cafe jacket potato\ninto your mouth before\nheading to an afternoon of\nlabs. And it is this. But it\ncan also be so much more.\nAs evidenced, not\nonly by this issue of\nPhoenix, but by all that\nhas been produced in the\npaper over the last term,\nstudents at Imperial have\na range of interests and\npassions outside their\ncourse. From our Books\nEditors being invested in\ndecolonising the canon, to\nour Film Editors predicting the Oscar awards, to\nour sports teams getting in\nreports every week (shout\nout to ICXCAC, you guys\nare the real MVP), for so\nmany of us life does not\njust begin and end with\nour studies.\nChristmas is nearly\nupon us, and I\u2019d like to\ntake this time to think\nabout some things I\u2019m\nthankful for. Firstly, I\u2019m\nthankful for the fact that\nthisisthelastissueofFelix\nfor a while \u2013 although\nthis job is great, there\u2019s\nonly so much late-night,\nhalf-price Wasabi I can\ntake. We\u2019ll be returning in\nJanuary, so don\u2019t worry,.\nI\u2019m also thankful to\nHamish Beck, our Puzzles\nEditor, who has helped\nmake the office a more\nhospitable place through\nhis donation of food\nand kitchen equipment.\nHamish has told me that\nhe doesn\u2019t read any of the\npaper that\u2019s not Puzzles\n(as many students do), so\nI doubt he\u2019ll see this.\nMost of all, I\u2019d like\nto thank the incredible\neditorial team we have at\nFelix. I started this year\nwith only a handful of\npeople on the team \u2013 the\nrest had graduated, moved\non, or (in one case)\nmoved to Japan to start\na new life as a post-doc-toral KWEEN. So I was\nworried that it would just\nbe me and a couple of the\nold Arts Editors in the\nFelix Office: it would be\ngreat, but no paper would\nbe produced. But what\nhappened was we spent\nthe summer putting out\nadverts, getting in touch\nwith various societies,\nand hearing of people who\nwere interested through\nword of mouth.\nWe started the year\nwith about 20 new people\n\u2013 a number that is steadily\ngrowing. They\u2019ve dealt\nwith my shit chat, learning\nhow to use InDesign, and\nthe total outage of the\nWest Basement computer\nnetwork, during which\ntime they just had to\ntwiddle their thumbs at\nhome. And they\u2019ve not\nasked for anything in\nexchange (except perhaps\na few Colin the caterpillar\ncakes...). They\u2019re doing\nit because they enjoy\nit \u2013 seeing their name in\nprint, and creating something they can physically\nhold in their hands. I am\nso proud of all of them,\nand I love them all more\nthan I could possibly say.\nThey\u2019ve been willing to\nslave away over a temperamental Mac computers\nfor hours to get their end\nof year lists to fit into the\ncorrect space, just so you\ncan skip past them and\nhead straight to the Horoscopes \u2013 and that\u2019s what\u2019s\nChristmas is all about.\n2\n\n"

We are proud to present the 2017 winners of this year\u2019s inaugural Felix\nFilm Awards! Read on to see who came out on top\u2026\nFILM\nAshley Luckyram\nFilm Editor\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nA\ns the year\nwinds to a\nclose, in lieu\nof compiling a\nlist of the best films, directorial work and acting\nperformances, we have\ndecided to hand out prizes\nto those who merit them\nfor their outstanding creative efforts. We imagine\nthat the finest talents in\nworld cinema are sat at\nthe edge of their seats in\nanticipation, hoping that\nthey are fortunate enough\nto earn a career-defining\ncommemoration from us.\nThere are no red carpets\nor golden statuettes, but\nwelcome to the inaugural\nFelix Film Awards.\n(Note: Only films with\nUK theatrical release dates\nin 2017 were eligible)\nBest Picture\nCall Me By Your Name\nGet Out\nMoonlight\nThe Florida Project\nThe Handmaiden\n2017 was a very strong\nyear for film. To narrow\ndown the nominees to just\nfive was challenging. To\nchoose a winner excru-ciating. In the end, Park\nChan-Wook\u2019s erotic, psychological thriller, period\ndrama (yes, you read that\nright) came out on top. Exquisitely crafted, bravely\nacted and grippingly\npaced, The Handmaiden is\nperhaps Park\u2019s crowning\nachievement ahead of the\nbrilliant Oldboy. This is a\ncompletely original work\nof art, and the fact that\nSouth Korea chose The\nAge of Shadows as its submission for the Academy\nAward for Best Foreign\nLanguage Film ahead\nof The Handmaiden is a\ntravesty worthy of a jaw\ndrop almost as big as the\nones you will experience\nthroughout this film.\nBest Director\nSean Baker (The\nFlorida Project)\nLuca Guadagnino (Call\nMe by Your Name)\nBarry Jenkins (Moon-light)\nChristopher Nolan\n(Dunkirk)\nPark Chan-Wook\n(The Handmaiden)\nWhen choosing which\ndirector you might have\nto adapt Fingersmith, a\nSarah Waters crime drama\nthat is absolutely steeped\nin its setting of Victorian\nEngland, Korean director\nPark Chan-Wook might\nnot immediately spring\nto mind. But scratch\nunder the surface, and the\ndecision makes perfect\nsense: Fingersmith is\nno novel of genteel\nVictoriana, but a gritty\nand dark narrative that\nrevels in violence and\nblack humour \u2013 two of\nPark\u2019s trademarks. With\nThe Handmaiden, Park\nnot only manages to\nsomehow keep the spirit\nof Waters\u2019 novel alive \u2013\ndespite shifting the action\nto Japanese-occupied\nKorea \u2013 but also adds\nhis own directorial nous.\nDelicately balancing a\ntricky script, which leaves\nthe audience reeling, with\na tightly-controlled visual\nlanguage, Park has made\none of the finest works in\nhis career.\nBest Actor\nCasey Affleck (Man-chester by the Sea)\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet\n(Call Me by Your Name)\nJames Franco (The\nDisaster Artist)\nJean-Pierre L\u00e9aud (La\nMort de Louis XIV)\nAdrian Titieni (Gradu-ation)\nWhen an actor is young,\nit can be tempting to filter\nanything they do through\ntheir youth. Good, solid\nperformances can be\npropelled to stratospheric\nheights if the person delivering those lines is under\nthe age of thirty, perhaps\nbecause we expect great\nperformances to only\ncome with experience.\nFor Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet,\nhowever, the star of simmering romance Call Me\nby Your Name, the hype\nis justified. At the tender\nage of 21, Chalamet has\ndelivered a performance\nthat is nuanced and re-strained, one that manages\nto convey the agonies and\ntribulations of young love\nand desire.\nBest Actress\nSonia Braga (Aquarius)\nRebecca Hall (Chris-tine)\nIsabelle Huppert\n(Elle)\nKim Min-Hee (The\nHandmaiden)\nNatalie Portman\n(Jackie)\nIsabelle Huppert has\nwon multiple C\u00e9sar\nAwards, a Golden Globe\nand the Best Actress\naward at all of the traditional big three festivals\n(Berlin, Cannes, Venice).\nThough she was robbed\nof the Academy Award\nearlier this year, she has\nnow reached the pinnacle\nof her career in winning\nthe Felix Award for best\nactress. She can finally\nretire happy, a wonderful\ncareer complete. Her\nperformance in Elle is a\ndevastating tour-de-force\nthat needs to be seen to be\nbelieved. 2017 was a phenomenal year for leading\nactress performances, and\nwhile the other nominees\nare all tremendous,\nHuppert showed once\nagain that she is just on\nanother level to everyone\nelse.\nBest Supporting Actor\nMahershala Ali (Moon-light)\nWillem Dafoe (The\nFlorida Project)\nJason Mitchell\n(Mudbound)\nMichael Stulhbarg\n(Call Me by Your Name)\nJean-Louis Trintignant\n(Happy End)\nThis is a category for\nthe unsung heroes of\ncinema, often made up\nWho will come out on top in this year\u2019s awards? // Moho Film/Sony Picture Classics/Canal\nAwards for 2017\nof young actors not quite\nready to carry a film, and\nolder actors deemed past\ntheir peak of marketabil-ity. Jason Mitchell is a\nyoung up-and-comer who\nhas used the buzz off of\nhis strong turn in Straight\nOutta Compton to appear\nin three very acclaimed\nfilms this year (Detroit,\nThe Disaster Artist and\nMudbound). Mahershala\nAli\u2019s career is on the\nrise too, having won the\nAcademy Award for the\nvery same performance\nhe is nominated for here.\nJean-Louis Trintignant\nis the old hand, a legend\nof French cinema still\ngoing strong into his late\n80s. Michael Stulhbarg\nis a wonderful actor who\nshines across a number\nof this year\u2019s awards\ncontenders in The Post,\nThe Shape of Water,\nand Call Me By Your\nName. The latter is his\nbig break (after his last\nbig break in his Golden\nGlobe-nominated turn for\nA Serious Man). Yet it is\nanother underappreciated\nveteran, Willem Dafoe,\nwho takes this one for his\nnuanced and grounded\nrole as a warm yet stern\nmotel manager. He is\namongst the favourites for\nthe upcoming Academy\nAwards.\nBest Supporting Actress\nGreta Gerwig (20th\nCentury Women)\nNaomie Harris (Moon-light)\nKim Tae-Ri (The\nHandmaiden)\nCarey Mulligan\n(Mudbound)\nMichelle Williams\n(Manchester by the Sea)\nPlaying one character\ncan be difficult enough,\nbut in The Handmaiden\nKim Tae-Ri \u2013 who makes\nher feature film debut \u2013\nplays a Russian doll of\na role. As Sook-hee, the\neponymous handmaiden\nof the film, Kim goes\nthrough various levels of\nsubterfuge, and we are\nnever quite sure what is\nan act and what is reality.\nKim manages to keep the\naudience going along with\nher journey throughout all\nthe twists and turns contained within The Handmaiden, which is no small\nfeat. An actor playing\nan actor, Kim takes on a\nmeta-role that is not quite\nmatched by any of the\nother nominees, making\nher a worthy winner of the\nprize.\nBest Adapted Screenplay\nArmando Iannucci &\nDavid Schneider & Ian\nMartin & Peter Fellows\n(The Death of Stalin)\nJames Ivory (Call Me\nby Your Name)\nBarry Jenkins (Moon-light)\nPark Chan-Wook &\nChung Seo-Kyung (The\nHandmaiden)\nVirgil Williams and\nDee Rees (Mudbound)\nThe great Stanley\nKubrick once said that\nin order to make a great\nfilm, one needed a great\nbook on which to base it.\nWhile history has shown\nthat many great films have\nliterature, and retaining its\nmessage while cutting bits\nout or changing things is\na treacherous tightrope to\nwalk. James Ivory does\nthis remarkably well with\nAndre Aciman\u2019s Call Me\nby Your Name, writing\na beautiful adaptation\nthat is in keeping with\nthe original novel, while\noffering a unique cinematic quality. The result is\nso good Aciman himself\nclaims it is better than his\nnovel. Ivory was initially\nsupposed to direct this\nwork, but can be satisfied\nwith his writing.\nBest Original Screenplay\nMaren Ade (Toni\nErdmann)\nYorgos Lanthimos &\nEfthymis Filippou (The\nKilling of a Sacred Deer)\nKenneth Lonergan\n(Manchester by the Sea)\nMike Mills (20th\nCentury Women)\nJordan Peele (Get Out)\nOriginal screenplays\nsaw what was perhaps\ntheir heyday in the \u201890s,\nwith seven figure spec\nsales almost a regular\noccurrence. They have\nbegun to make a resurgence in recent years, and\nthis was a particularly\ntight category, with a\ndiverse set of nominees\nso different to each other.\nIn the end Maren Ade\u2019s\nToni Erdmann triumphed\nover the incumbent\nAcademy Award-winning\nscript amongst others\nto claim the prestigious\nFelix Award. Ade\u2019s\nunconventional comedy\nis ostensibly about the\nrelationship between an\nup-tight career-obsessed\nyoung woman and her\ncarefree, juvenile father,\na subject underexplored\nby cinema historically. In\nthe background are deeper\nissues about gender\ndiscrimination in the\nworkplace and the hollow\nnature of capitalist greed,\nall interwoven beautifully\nwith a bizarre humour\nderived from a wholly\noriginal premise.\nBest Cinematography\nChung Chung-Hoon\n(The Handmaiden)\nRoger Deakins (Blade\nRunner 2049)\nJames Laxton (Moon-light)\nLinus Sandgren (La La\nLand)\nHoyte van Hoytema\n(Dunkirk)\nThere were a number of\nbeautifully shot films this\nyear, many of which did\nnot even make the list of\nnominees. We have seen\ndifferent projects using\nfilm, be it 16mm, 35mm\nor even 70mm, all to great\nSean Baker (The\nFlorida Project)\nTom Cross (La La\nLand)\nKim Jae-Bum & Kim\nSang-Bum (The Handmaiden)\nNat Sanders and Joi\nMcMillon (Moonlight)\nLee Smith (Dunkirk)\nCast your mind back\nto great films by the likes\nof someone like Robert\nBresson, and it is clear\nthat the editing is so good\nbecause you don\u2019t notice\nit\u2019s there. Tom Cross\u2019 collaborations with Damien\nChazelle have been the\ncomplete opposite, and\nthat demonstrates the good\nediting is about aiding\nthe story. Where Bresson\ndemanded the attention\nto be on intimate details,\nChazelle has shown\nhimself to be extremely\nflashy since his breakthrough with Whiplash.\nThat was a masterclass is\nfast cutting sequences to\nmaintain a relentless pace.\nLa La Land is a sweeping\nmusical with a number of\nsingle take song and dance\nnumbers, and Tom Cross\nis able to keep the sense\nof nostalgia while adding\na modern, dynamic edge.\nBest Score\nNicholas Britell\n(Moonlight)\nJo Yeong-Wook (The\nHandmaiden)\nMica Levi (Jackie)\nOneohtrix Point Never\n(Good Time)\nHans Zimmer\n(Dunkirk)\nFirst comment on this\ncategory: La La Land,\nwhich took home the\nAcademy Award, has\ngood songs, but not much\nof a score. There is a dif-ference. The score is there\nto aid the vision of the\ndirector, and add layers\nto the narrative. Zimmer\u2019s\nmachine-like sounds add\nto the sense of suspense\nin Dunkirk, the wonderfully named Oneohtrix\nPoint Never\u2019s electronic\nvibes drive gritty heist\nthriller Good Time, and\nBritell and Jo\u2019s work\non Moonlight and The\nHandmaiden respectively\nare just regal. That being\nsaid, the way in which\nMica Levi\u2019s score for\nJackie accompanies Pablo\nLarrain\u2019s tight close-ups\nto create a claustrophobia\nleaves the viewer barely\nable to breathe, just as\nJackie Kennedy was in\nthe days after her husband\nJFK was assassinated in\nfront of the nation.\nBest Documentary\nCameraperson\nCity of Ghosts\nI Am Not Your Negro\nI Called Him Morgan\nTower\nDocumentaries are not\nnormally associated with\nthe theatre in the same\nway that big costume\ndramas or high octane\naction films are. This has\nled to Netflix becoming\nperhaps the strongest\ndistributor of non-fiction\nfilm, for those seeking\nsomething enlightening\nwhen they stay in on a cold\nnight, or unwind after a\nhard day\u2019s work. I Am Not\nYour Negro smashes this\npattern to smithereens,\nmanaging to take almost\n$10 million in the States\nalone against a $1 million\nbudget. This is a crucial\nincendiary meditation on\nrace relations in America.\n\u201cDoing justice\nto a piece of\nliterature is a\ntreacherous\ntightrope\nto walk, but\nJames Ivory\ndoes it with\nskill\u201d\nbeen made from original\nconcepts, a great book\ncan be a solid foundation\nfrom which to work from.\nThat being said, properly\ndoing justice to a piece of\n\u201cRoger\nDeakins is\none of the all-time greats\nof modern\ncinema\u201d\neffect, while many have\nshown that digital really\nis a viable option for conjuring beautiful images.\nIt would be wrong to\ngive this award to anyone\nother than Roger Deakins\nthough. The man is one\nof the all-time greats, and\nhas mystifyingly never\nonce won the Academy\nAward from his thirteen\nnominations, for titles\nthat include Fargo, No\nCountry for Old Men\nand The Assassination\nof Jesse James by the\nCoward Robert Ford.\nHe is the favourite for\nthis year\u2019s award for\nhis astonishing work on\nBlade Runner 2049, but\nif he is indeed snaked\nonce again, he will at\nleast have a Felix Award\nto console him.\nBest Editing\n\u201cThe way Mica\nLevi\u2019s score\nfor Jackie\naccompanies\nthe tight close-ups leaves\nthe viewer\nbarely able to\nbreathe\u201d\n\n"

Himid, 63,\nis the oldest recipient of\nthe prestigious award, as\nwell as the first woman\nof colour to be given the\nhonour. Widely expected\nto win for her work that\nfocuses on promoting the\nstories and voices of the\nAfrican diaspora through\ndrawings, printmaking\nand installations, Himid\u2019s\nwin was made possible by\nthe lifting of the age restriction that has prevented artists over 50 years old\nfrom winning in previous\nyears. It is speculated that\nanother rule change may\nhave benefited Himid:\nfor the first time, the exhibition the artist curates\nspecifically for the Turner\nPrize was taken into\nconsideration. This meant\nthat Himid was judged not\nonly on her contribution\nto contemporary art in\nthe past twelve months\n\u2013 as has been the case\npreviously \u2013 but also the\nmini-retrospective of her\nwork that she displayed at\nthe Ferens Gallery in Hull,\nwhere the prize-giving\ntook place.\nThe judges remarked\nparticularly on A Fashionable Marriage \u2013 a piece\nHimid created in 1986\ninspired by the tableau of\ncharacters in Hogarth\u2019s\nMarriage a la Mode. The\ninclusion of Margaret\nThatcher and Ronald\nReagan as flirting lovers\ndates the piece, but its\nexploration of politics, the\njudges felt, was \u201cresonant\nand relevant\u201d today. Other\npieces of note included in\nthe exhibition was a series\nof pages torn from The\nGuardian that Himid has\nworked on for many years.\nIn painting over sections\nof the newspaper\u2019s pages\nHimid highlights the\ninterplay between the\nheadlines and the accompanying (often unrelated)\npictures of black people.\nThe juxtaposition of\nthese elements, Himid\nargues, cements unconscious racial stereotypes\n\u2013 drawing caricatures of\nblack people as victims\nand perpetrators of\nviolence, imagery particularly potent as black\npeople are rarely visible\nin other contexts in the\nmainstream media.\nHimid, who was\nbrought up in Lancashire\nand works in Preston, but\nwas born in Zanzibar,\nTanzania to a black father\nand a white mother, has\nmade a career of making\nblack lives more visible.\nIn Naming the Money,\nwhich she conceived of\nin 2004 and was exhibited\nthis year in the Museum\nof Modern Art in Oxford\nand Spike Island in Bristol\n\u2013 the shows that earned\nher the Turner prize nomination \u2013 Himid seeks to\ndraw out forgotten figures\nfrom history and set them\napart from the monolith\nthat the word \u2018slaves\u2019\nconstructs. For this work\nHimid has constructed\nover 100 life-size cut-outs,\neach a representation of a\nslave. The figures, dressed\nin brightly coloured\nfinery, and engaged in all\nsorts of different pursuits,\nfrom playing musical instruments to playing with\npuppies, each have accompanying text \u2013 written\nby and read aloud by\nHimid \u2013 gallery goers can\nlisten to on a soundtrack,\nthis text gives two names\nto each figure, the one\nthey were born with, and\na second they were given\nby their owners. As the\nviewer moves through\nthe exhibition, each\nfigure explains what they\ndid before being sold,\nand what they do now\nas an enslaved person.\nAllowing these figures\nto give a sense of their\nhistory before they got on\nthe boat that would take\nthem to the West returns\ntheir dignity to them.\nThe exuberance, the joy\nof these figures dressed\nup in flamboyant patterns\nand jewel colours is important too. Himid is not\ninterested in \u201creplaying\ntheir trauma\u201d, but wants\ninstead to celebrate their\nresilience, their capacity\nto beautify the world\naround them despite the\natrocities committed\nagainst them \u2013 \u201cthey are\nstronger than history, that\nis the point. My figures\nsay: \u2018You tell me your\nstory, I\u2019ll tell you mine\u2019\u201d\nshe said, speaking to The\nGuardian prior to her win\non Tuesday.\nIronically, Himid, in\nher pursuit of making\nother more visible has\ngone rather unrecognised\nherself. Himid was\n\u201cthrilled\u201d to win, and\nthanked her long-time\nsupporters saying \u201cto the\nart and cultural historians\nwho cared enough to write\nessays about my work for\ndecades - thank you, you\ngave me sustenance in\nthe wilderness years.\u201d\nShe speculated that she\nmay not have received\nmore mainstream acclaim\nbecause the public were\nnot ready to receive her\nwork until recently and\nthe subjects she tackled\nwere too \u201ccomplex,\nmany-layered\u201d to sell\nnewspapers.\nAlex Farquharson,\nthe director of Tate\nBritain, and the chair of\nthe judging panel, said\nthat Himid\u2019s win was a\nreminder of the fact \u201cthat\nartists can experience\na breakthrough in their\nwork at any age\u201d.\nHimid hopes the Prize,\nworth \u00a325,000 previously\nwon by Steve McQueen,\nDamien Hirst, and\nGrayson Perry, amongst\nothers, will give her the\nprominence to work with\nmore artists. As for the\nmoney, she\u2019ll be using\nit to commission fellow\nartists perhaps, or buy a\nnew pair of shoes.\nThe Tanzanian-born artist who amplifies the stories of people of the African diaspora is the oldest-ever winner of\nthe prestigious award celebrating contemporary British art.\nLubaina Himid, Naming the Money (2004). Courtesy of the artist, Hollybush Gardens, and National Museums, Liverpool // Stuart Whipps\nSeeing the world differently: art drained of colour\nM\no n o -c h r o m e\nat the\nNational\nGallery explores monochrome paintings through\ntime, spanning seven\ncenturies and displaying\n50 works of art. The exhibition follows a thematic\nsequence, with some clear\ngems but a lack of direc-tion, rescued by a twist at\nthe end.\nThe first section\ndisplays works from the\nMiddle Ages to the 17th\ncentury with a Biblical\ntheme. At this period in\ntime coloured artworks\nwere seen to be decadent\nand distracting, greyscale\npaintings were seen\nas a more appropriate\nbackdrop to meditation\nand devotion. Other uses\nof greyscale in biblical art\nand sacred art included\ndepicting Christ\u2019s Passion\nor the martyrdom of the\nsaints. The absence of\ncolour was also used to\ncontrast the Old Testament\nwith the New Testament,\npresenting Christianity as\nincomplete without the\ncolour of Christ.\nOthers painted in\nmonochrome to explore\nlight and shadow before\nthey created their final\ncoloured versions. In the\nthird section, independent\nartworks in their own right\nare revisited, again most\nhave sacred themes. In the\nfollowing sections, monochrome paintings used to\nprepare designs for, and\nlater mimic sculpture and\nmedia are displayed. The\nmost striking example displayed is Jacob De Wit\u2019s\nJupiter and Ganymede\n(1739), which without\nthe shadows created\nby artificial light in the\ngallery could easily be\nmistaken for marble. The\nresult requires you to look\ntwice - delivering a sort\nof punchline at second\nglance.\nThe effect of more\nmodern technologies on\nmonochrome paintings\nare then explored. Contrasting the photorealistic\nsculpture are obscured\nworks, often alongside or\ninspired by photographs,\nsuch as Chuck Close\u2019s\nJoel. Where monochrome\nversions provided a new\ndimension to coloured\npaintings in the 18th\nand\n19th\ncenturies, paint is now\nused to abstract images\nrepresented with photographs and film. While\nthere are some beautiful\nworks in this section and\nthose preceding it, the\nvibe of the exhibition is at\ntimes dry and exhausting-ly technical. Finally there\nis relief in abstract artwork\nincluding Malevich\u2019s\niconic Black Square.\nOnly at this point does the\nexhibition start to come\ntogether as a coherent ex-perience, albeit somewhat\ndisjointed.\nThe final room is an\nart installation, which\nupon entering looks like\nnothing special \u2013 an empty\nroom with orange lights.\nSoon it becomes apparent\nthat what makes it special\nis that it is solely that \u2013 an\nempty room with orange\nlights. Given that there\nis only one frequency of\nlight in the room, colours\ncan\u2019t be seen or deci-phered, and everything\nis blanketed in greyscale.\nThe experience is discon-certing, and other details\nseem sharper. It seems\nwithout the interference\nof colour details are more\nintense and vision more\nvivid. Looking at your\nown hands with the colour\ndrained from them feels\nOdalisque in Grisaille // Jean-Auguste-Domonique Ingres and workshop\n\u201cWithout the\ninterference of\ncolour details\nare more\nintense, and\nvision more\nvivid\u201d like being transported into\na film. While you are encouraged to take and share\nphotographs and share\nthem #SeeDifferently,\nthe effects aren\u2019t as clear\nwhen captured. Any RGB\ndetection from a basic\ncamera upsets the white\nbalance and the image\nis different from the one\nrelayed by our eyes. The\neffect of colour, and our\nreliance on it to understand and punctuate our\nsurroundings suddenly\nbecomes a huge question.\nARTS\nFelix Arts is on the prowl for\nmore content writers!\nIf you have a love for theatre,\na buring passion for art, or get giddy for dance,\njoin our Facebook Group:\nFelix Arts 2017/18\nFor the low-low price of a review, you can\nrequest press tickets to any show or\nexhibition in London.\nWe\u2019ll even publish your name.\nWhere?

And let\u2019s not forget both Liam\nand Noel Gallagher who, in the face of adversity, managed to regain some semblance of relevance.\nMUSIC\nAdrian LaMoury\nMusic Editor\n10\nOczy Mlody\nThe Flaming Lips\nTucked away at the\nbeginning of the year\nwas the 14th album by\npsychedelic veterans The\nFlaming Lips. Blending\nrock and electronica, this\ncolourful LP is a neatly\nproduced experimental\npiece that, despite the\nmany references to\nunicorns and a bizarre\nfeature by Miley Cyrus,\nretains a bewildering\ncoherence. After pushing\nmusical boundaries for 34\nyears now, Wayne Coyne\n& co. are still leading\nthe pack with no signs of\nslowing down.\n9\nInterplanetary Class\nClassics\nThe Moonlandingz\nPugnacious, scuzzy\nand lewd is the debut\nalbum by this side\nproject, consisting of\nmembers from Fat White\nFamily and Eccentronic\nResearch Council. With\nhelp from Sean Lennon\n& Yoko Ono, we\u2019re\ntreated to 41 minutes of\ncascading synths, exhilarating cynicism and Iggy\nPop-esque snarls.\n8\nLotta Sea Lice\nCourtney Barnett &\nKurt Vile\nAs Felix reported at\nthe time, this collaborative album doesn\u2019t quite\ncapture the full frenetic\nwit of Barnett\u2019s solo\nwork, nor is it the intri-cate, immersive daydream\nthat we\u2019ve come to expect\nfrom Vile. It is, however,\nsoaked in the playful\nintimacy of two friends\nand artists, working\ntogether to produce something fun, sentimental and\nwholesome.\n7\nMigration\nBonobo\nBy far his most sophisticated work to date,\nBonobo\u2019s world-influ-enced electronica is crisp\nand finessed. Constructing serene, atmospheric\nsoundscapes comes\nnaturally to Simon Green\nat this point, and he does\nit better than anyone else.\n6\nAntisocialites\nAlvvays\nDropping some of\nthe teenage insecurities\nof their first album, the\nsophomore effort by the\nCanadian cuties is still\nfun and delicate indie\npop, but with a newfound\nconfidence and wisdom.\nCompelling from start to\nfinish, this brisk record\ncements the five-piece as\nones to watch.\n5\nSlowdive\nSlowdive\nOver the course of the\n22 years since shoegaze\ndarlings Slowdive were\npanned by critics and\ndropped from their record\nlabel, they\u2019ve amassed\na greater following than\nthey\u2019d ever experienced\npreviously. The first\nof two big comeback\nalbums on this list was a\ngargantuan sonic assault,\nreminiscent of their early\nwork but in the format of\na more conventional rock\nLP. Turbulent and tender,\nthis is an album made\nfor live shows; as such,\nthey underwent an extensive and well-attended\ntour, culminating in a\nwildly impressive gig at\nCamden\u2019s roundhouse.\n4\nThe Weather\nPond\nThese Australian\npsych-rockers first came\ninto being as something\nof a Tame Impala side\nproject, with multiple\nmembers shared between\nthe two bands. Though\nfully autonomous, Pond\nhas been generally\novershadowed by their\nparent outfit, and so has\nexisted largely under the\nradar. This latest effort,\nhowever, is an absolute\nstandout. With Tame\nImpala frontman Kevin\nParker lending a hand on\nproduction, the LP is a\nshimmering whirlwind\nwith incredible energy.\nDystopian visions of the\nband\u2019s hometown, Perth,\nare seen through a kaleidoscopic lens, sporting\nanguish and amazement\nin equal measure.\n3\nV\nThe Horrors\nMore muscular than\nwe\u2019ve previously seen\nthem, the dream-pop\nquintet from Southendon-Sea have adopted a\nnew sound on this, their\nfifth full length outing.\nRousing new wave with a\nfamiliar Human League/\nOMD vibe punctuates\ntheir distinctive industrial drone, resulting in\nsomething that is both\ndanceable and disturbing.\nOpaque and unrelenting, it\nmay have lost some of the\nartsy innocence of their\nprevious work, but my\ngod, does it sound good.\n2\nAmerican Dream\nLCD Soundsystem\nThere\u2019s always the\nworry that a return after\nhiatus as highly anticipated as this one is going to\nunderwhelm, and so very\noften it does. However,\nthis was not true of LCD.\nAs Felix reported, this is\nsome of the most stellar\nwork we\u2019ve seen from\nJamesMurphyandfriends.\nBrooding, reflective and\nlittered with homages\nto their musical heroes,\nthis nearly faultless LP\nshowed that though they\nmay be getting on a bit,\nthey\u2019re still nowhere near\nlosing their edge.\n1\nA Deeper Understanding\nThe War on Drugs\nThe massive critical\nacclaim of 2014\u2019s Lost\nin the Dream set the bar\ndesperately high. Producing a follow up that could\nmatch it must\u2019ve seemed\na nigh on impossible\ntask for the Philadelphia\nmisfits. Adam Granduciel\u2019s response was to\nretreat into the studio for\nthree years of meticulous\ncrafting. The result didn\u2019t\nmatch their earlier effort,\nit surpassed it, with\nease. To dismiss them as\nSpringsteen-esque Dad\nrock is demeaning; while\ntheir inspirations may be\nrooted in the mid-80s,\nthey\u2019re in no way rehashing that scene. Sublime,\nextended guitar play hints\nat big riffs but seldom\nrealises them, creating in-tricate, effervescent layers\nof sound that submerge\nand consume you,\nsuperbly engineered with\ngreat depth and clarity. If\nthe previous LP was an\nethereal dream, this one is\nan otherworldly reality.\nBella Union\nMatador\nTransgressive Records\nNinja Tune\nTransgressive Records\nDead Oceans\nMarathon Artists\nWolf Tone\nColumbia\nAtlantic\n\n"

The letter, signed\nby around 150 students,\ncalled on the university\nto \u201cmeaningfully incorporate\u201d non-white authors\nand postcolonial thought\ninto the curriculum, rather\nthan having it as an \u201cafterthought\u201d in the form of\nan optional paper in their\nfinal year.\nThe Daily Telegraph\npicked up on this story\nand claimed that Olufemi\nwas trying to \u201creplace\u201d\nwhite writers with black\nones, leading to a barrage\nof social media abuse\ndirected at her. That a\nsimple call to diversify\none\u2019s reading list was\npainted as an attempt to\neliminate white men is\nemblematic of precisely\nthe very problem that\nOlufemi is trying to\naddress.\nLiterature is meant to\ncapture a shared humanity.\nIt describes the human experience in all its myriad\nforms \u2013 a collective\ncultural baggage that we\nall shoulder together. A\ncurriculum comprising\nonly of privileged, white\nmale writers narrows\none\u2019s study of literature\nand the human experience\nseverely, shaping a parochial view of the world. If\nanything, the study of Literature is the best vehicle\nto challenge one\u2019s preconceived ideas and make one\nmore open-minded \u2013 this\nshould be part of its aim.\nAfter all, reading allows\none to inhabit someone\nelse\u2019s life, in another\ntime, culture, and place,\ngenerating empathy and\nallowing a richer appreciation of life.\nHowever, I would\nlike to distinguish here\nbetween simply \u2018diversifying\u2019 the curriculum and\nputting more focus on\npostcolonial writing. Postcolonial writing is not all\nof this diversification: it\nspecifically involves ideas\nof reclaiming voice, of\nspeaking out and speaking\nback to those traditionally\nin power, and of telling\none\u2019s own narrative in\none\u2019s own voice, rather\nthan that of the coloniser.\nThere is value, however,\nin diversifying curriculum\nby including writing from\ncultures and experiences\nthat are not our own, even\nif they are not postcolonial\nin nature.\nOf course, when one\nstudies English Literature,\none expects to learn texts\nfrom the English canon,\nand I can understand why\ntranslated works are not\nincluded \u2013 they would be\nincluded in the literary\nstudies of their respective languages. There\nis limited time within a\ncurriculum to teach all\nthe good literature that is\nout there. Thus, curating\nthe curriculum becomes\nall the more important.\nWhile classic white male\nEnglish writers should\nnever be removed from\nthe curriculum, there\nshould perhaps still be\nspace for writers from\ndifferent backgrounds.\nOlufemi is right in insisting that \u201cpostcolonial\nwriting is not an after-thought, it is English Literature\u201d \u2013 unlike simply\nreading from different\ncultures, postcolonial literature itself is entwined\nwith English history, and\nthus should be part of\nthe English canon. The\nprocess of colonisation,\nand the bloodshed,\nevangelism, and cultural\nmixing and clashing that\nfollowed, bring together\ntwo peoples, the coloniser\nand the colonised, and\nthere is no extracting one\nfrom this shared history.\nThe exclusion of postcolonial literature from the\nmain English curriculum\nis a blatant denial that this\nshared history exists.\nInterestingly, The\nGuardian\u2019s suggested\nlist of BAME writers to\npick up did not include a\nsingle East Asian writer.\nIt is a trend I have noticed\nin BAME advocacy and\nespecially in the study of\nLiterature. It appears to\nme that East Asian writers\nthat write in English tend\nto be seen as more \u2018white\u2019\n\u2013 think of Man Booker\nPrize-winning and now\nNobel Literature laureate\nKazuo Ishiguro. His\nbooks are widely read,\nbut mostly speak from the\nEnglish tradition \u2013 not sur-prisingly, since he grew up\nin the UK. However, even\nwhen we consider Haruki\nMurakami, who writes in\nhis native Japanese and\nwhose translated works\nare popular in the West,\nlittle is said about reading\nhim as a form of BAME\nresistance. This is despite\nthe fact that his stories do\nstem from an East Asian\ntradition, and carry with it\nits own cultural concepts.\nPerhaps this is because\nmany East Asian territories have not been\ncolonised by the West,\nand there is not so much\na \u2018decolonisation\u2019 to write\nabout than a simple diversification and broadening\nof horizons to be done.\nSoutheast Asia, however,\nhas a history of being\ncolonised by the West,\nand has its own body of\npostcolonial literature as\nwell. Why are these works\nnot included in BAME\nLiterature lists?\nIt is my opinion that\npostcolonial thought\nshould also be extended to\ninclude other alternative\nvoices, such as feminist\nand LGBT+ writing.\nPostcolonial theory can be\napplied to any community\nwhose voices are or once\nwere suppressed, but who\nthen develop a body of\nwork that tell their stories\nin their own voices. This\nis why works like Jackie\nKay\u2019s Trumpet, which\ntells the story of a black\nman originally born a\nwoman, written in the\nmost beautiful prose, are\nso important in representing the human experience\nin the diversity that it is.\nLiterature, as a vehicle\nfor diverse experiences\nthat represent a shared\nhuman experience, should\nnot be confined to the\nvoice of any one com-munity. Humanity pro-gresses, and the study of\nliterature, that represents\nhumanity, should move\nwith the times as well.\nJackie Kay\u2019s Trumpet can allow us to see a different experience // Uni of Salford\nMurakami and Ishiguro are often ignored when discussing BAME writers // Wikimedia\n\n"

They\nare birdwatchers, with the\nlove for birds and curiosity\nto explore nature. As one\nof them, I go out to different places to observe birds\nin their most natural and\nundisturbed environment.\nBirdwatching is getting\nincreasingly popular and\nis an absolutely fun and\nexciting outdoor activity.\nHowever, when being\na birdwatcher clashes\nwith being a full-time\nundergraduate student,\nyou often struggle to find\ntime to simply dash into\nthe wild and see new bird\nspecies. But this May,\nI was lucky enough to\ngo on a weekend trip to\nPembrokeshire, organised\nby the Fellwanderers, the\nIC hiking society. As a\nbirdwatcher who hasn\u2019t\nbeen in the fields for quite\na while, I decided to travel\nwith a bunch of mountain\nfanatics and search for one\nof my favourite birds \u2013 the\ngannet.\nUnfortunately, it was\nraining the whole morning\non the first day of hiking,\nand there were no signs\nof any birds. I felt a bit\ndampened as I slowly put\nthe binoculars back into\nmy bag and continued\nclimbing.\nAround noon, we approached an open pebble\nbeach. By that time, the\nrain had stopped and the\nclouds had started to clear.\nI joined others in observing clams on rocks that\nwere constantly breathing\nout foam. A few birds\nflew off, wailing above\nthe sea, so I took out my\nbinoculars for a closer\nlook. \u201cNot exciting\u201d, I\nmurmured to myself, \u201cjust\nsome seagulls\u201d.\nAs I moved my binoculars across the sea, a dark\nand swift figure suddenly\ncaught my attention \u2013 the\nwings were longer and\nnarrower, with dark\nmarkings at the tips. It\nwas gliding low over the\nsea and suddenly plunged\ninto the water. A few\nseconds later, it emerged\nat a different spot. My\nheart started to pound as\nI could see its distinctive\nbeak \u2013 lo and behold, it\nwas a gannet! And in real\nlife it looked a lot larger\nthan I expected! The\nexcitement was doubled\nas I discovered there\nwere three more gannets\nhovering further in the\ndistance. In spite of the\nstrong wind, they were\ncruising in the air with\nsuch amazing balance and\nstability. They lingered\nfor a while, then flew\nfurther and eventually\ndisappeared over the far\nhorizon.\nWe left the pebble\nbeach and ascended to\nthe top of a hill. The\nview was wider, and I\nnoticed a crow-like bird\ngliding along the cliff. I\npulled out my camera and\nquickly took a few shots.\nThe bright red beak gave\naway its species \u2013 it was\na chough. I found that\nparticularly surprising\nsince I didn\u2019t expect to\nsee a chough on the coast.\nIn the next few fours, I\nalso added a few new\nspecies to my list \u2013 siskin,\nbuzzard, and red kite.\nThis trip made me\nrealize that sometimes\nwe forget how incredible\nwildlife is, especially after\nliving in huge cities for a\nlong time. But if we start\nMingke Pan\nTravel Writer\nTRAVEL\n\u201cIf we start\npaying more\nattention\nto living\ncreatures\naround us, we\ncan begin to\nappreciate the\nbeauty and\ndiversity of\nnature.\u201c\npaying more attention to\nliving creatures around us,\nwe can begin to appreciate\nthe beauty and diversity\nof nature. With this new\nperspective in mind,\ntravelling can turn into\na different and amazing\nwildlife adventure. So\nkeep your mind open and\nnever stop exploring!\nBirdwatching offers a new and exciting way of travelling \u2013 all you need is a pair of binoculars and a passion for\nwildlife.

A local multiplayer mode is included,\nwhere eight people can\nplay together in a local\nset up (MarioKart DS\nmemories). The Switch\nboasts two handheld\ncontrollers which can be\nused when playing single\nplayer, multiplayer or\nwhen you just want good\nol\u2019 motion control (just\nlike your trusty vintage\nWii remote).\nGames include popular\ntitles like Mario Kart 8\nDeluxe, Legend of Zelda:\nBreath of the Wild, Mario\nand Rabbids Kingdom\nBattle and Super Mario\nOdyssey. According to\nSeptember 2017 sales\nfigures, the Nintendo\nSwitch has been immensely popular; selling\n7.63 million units globally\nat \u00a3279.99 each.\nApril 2017 saw the US\nrelease of the Amazon\nEcho Look.

This\nweather gets us all\nreaching for a few ne-cessities, fluffy blankets,\nbobble hats and sugary\nhot drinks.\nMove over pumpkin\nspiced latte, it\u2019s time\nfor the festive winter\nwarmers to reign\nsupreme. This has given\nme the perfect excuse\nto run all over London\ntrying different hot\nchocolates. Such a chore,\nbut hey, someone had to\ndo it. I\u2019ve picked three to\ntell you all about \u2013 one\ntraditional, one hipster,\nand one that\u2019s somehow\nboth, a hybrid if you will.\nLe Pain Quotidien \u2013\nThe Traditional One\nI nipped down Exhibition Road between\nlectures to try the traditional Belgian hot chocolate served at Le Pain\nQuotidien. A bowl of\nsteamed milk with a thin\nlayer of foam on top was\nbrought to my table with\nlike molten chocolate,\nbasically a chocolate\nsauce \u2013 yum. The hipster\nelement comes from the\nfact that the mugs are\ndipped in the holy trinity\nitself was too bitter for my\ntaste, and so I had to drink\nit slowly with small sips.\nBut it was balanced really\nwell by the sweetness of\nthe massive (imagine ice\ncream scoop size) toasted\nmarshmallow placed on\ntop, which would arguably\nbe too sickly sweet if the\nliquid was less bitter. So\nperhaps it works? This\none\u2019s definitely down to\npersonal taste. It\u2019s perfect\nfor people who feel that\na hot chocolate isn\u2019t a\nhot chocolate unless\ngarnished with marshmal-lows. They also embellish\nit with a small chocolate\nsquare bearing the name\n\u2018Chin Chin\u2019on it, which is\na nice touch, but let\u2019s face\nit, more for the aesthetic\non Instagram than for\nanything else.\nSaid Dal 1923 \u2013 The\nHybrid\nThe hot chocolates\nserved at this rustic Soho\ncafe are traditional in the\nsense that they originate\nfrom Roman recipes.\nThe delicious drink is\na separate small jug of\nthick liquid hot chocolate.\nPouring the chocolate\ninto the bowl and mixing\nit into the milk certainly\nadds a fun element to\nhot chocolate drinking.\nThe downside is that it\u2019s\nimpossible to get all the\ncontents of the jug out\n\u201cI\u2019ve\npicked one\ntraditional,\none hipster,\nand one that\u2019s\nsomehow\nboth, a hybrid\nif you will\u201d\nby pouring it. I ended up\nscraping every last bit out\nusing a spoon and eating\nit neat in a desperate\nattempt to not waste any.\nFood wastage in any form\nis never good. The drink\nis milkier than the average\nhot chocolate. Think of it\nas the latte equivalent of\nthe hot chocolate family.\nAs someone who is not\na huge fan of the taste\nof milk, I prefer a more\nindulgent hot chocolate,\nbut each to their own.\nChin Chin \u2013 The\nHipster One\nThis small chain started\nin Camden, where it\u2019s\ncalled Chin Chin Labs,\nand is famous for its nitro\nice-cream; hipster or\nwhat. It has now spread to\na couple of other locations\nin London, including the\nChin Chin Dessert Club\nin Soho, where I dragged\na friend earlier in the\nweek. The hot chocolate\n\u201cThe mugs are\ndipped in the\nholy trinity of\nchocolates:\ndark, milk\nand white.\nYou heard me\nright.\u201d\nof chocolates: dark, milk\nand white. You heard me\nright. This is as close as\nyou are ever going to get\nto drinking hot chocolate in a chocolate cup,\nwhich of course would\nbe incredibly impractical.\nThey offer three types of\nhot chocolate drink: dark,\nmilk, and gianduia (with\nhazelnut). I opted for the\nmilk chocolate but they\nall looked and smelled\namazing. I\u2019ll probably\nreturn over the Christmas\nperiod to try the other two.\nIf you\u2019re keen to go,\nI\u2019d recommend visiting\nduring the week. Last time\nI tried to go on a Saturday\nthey were queuing out the\ndoor. So I eventually gave\nup and went elsewhere. On\nthis occasion, the person\nat the back of the queue\ncalled up Said Dal 1923\nto book and managed to\nskip the queue. Who knew\ndesperation for a good hot\nchocolate would lead to\nsuch sneaky tactics. I will\ntotally use this strategy\nnext time.\nPouring the liquid chocolate into the milk at Le Pain\nQuotidien could be a new form of art. I\u2019m expecting a\ncall from the Saatchi Gallery any day now\nThis one\u2019s for the budding Instagramers looking for\ninspiration. Head to Greek Street, Soho\nThis is what it looked before I scraped all the chocolate\noff. No regrets\n\u201cChin Chin\nis definitely\ndown to personal taste.\nIt\u2019s perfect for\nthose who feel\na hot chocolate isn\u2019t a\nhot chocolate\nunless it\u2019s got\nmarshmallows\u201d\n\n"

Join Felix\u2019s resident hiphop aficianado to see how 2017 measured up in comparison.\n10\nFUTURE\nFuture\nIn February, Future quietly went about making\nhistory by dropping two\nalbums, FUTURE and\nHNDRXX, in the space\nof seven days. In doing\nso, he became the first\nartist in music history\nto have two different\nalbums debut at number one in consecutive\nweeks. On HNDRXX,\nwe were met with the\nmore vulnerable, sensitive side of Future but,\nwith FUTURE being\nhome to two of my favourite tracks of the\nyear in I\u2019m So Groovy\nand the infectious Mask\nOff, I couldn\u2019t deny his\neponymous album its\nspot on my list.\n9\nPretty Girls Like\nTrap Music\n2 Chainz\nMartin Luther King Jr.\nfamously once said,\n\u201cwe hold these truths to\nbe self-evident, that all\nmen are created equal;\nthat water is wet; and\nthat 2 Chainz simply\ndoes not deliver bad\nverses\u201d. I challenge anyone reading to find me\na bad 2 Chainz verse in\nthe last six years (his\nverse on the remix of\nRobin Thicke\u2019s 2013\ntrack, Give It 2 U, is\nthe closest I can recall).\nPretty Girls Like Trap\nMusic is a hood classic\nfrom one of the most\nconsistent veterans in\nthe game right now.\n8\nLaila\u2019s Wisdom\nRapsody\nI first encountered Rapsody when she stole\nthe show with the final verse on Kendrick\nLamar\u2019s Complexion\n(A Zulu Love) from his\n2015 album To Pimp a\nButterfly. It is not often\nthat a rapper completely\noutshines Kendrick on a\ntrack but Rapsody is not\nyour average artist. Her\nimmaculately woven\nlyrical content shines\nthrough on Laila\u2019s Wisdom, an album which\nhas been dangerously\nslept on in my opinion,\nand even to earn itself\na well-deserved 2018\nGrammy nomination\nfor \u201cBest Rap Album\u201d .\n7\nWins & Losses\nMeek Mill\nAfter the monumental\nL he sustained in his\ninfamous 2015 beef\nwith Drake, Meek Mill\nfound his career at a\ncrossroads. Although\nhis core fan base remained loyal, many\ncasual Meek Mill fans\nsimply lost interest and\ndidn\u2019t want to hear from\nhim anymore, reducing\nhim to little more than\nthe easily meme-able\nbutt of the joke. Things\nhad gone quiet for\nMeek and he faced the\nchallenge of reviving\nhis faltering career and\nrecapturing the hearts\nand minds of his wider\naudience. The October\n2016 release of his DC4\nmixtape, the fourth instalment of his Dreamchasers series, served as\na welcome reminder of\nMeek\u2019s talent as an MC\nand arguably reignited\nthe fire that his career\nhad been severely lack-ing. With Wins & Losses, Meek successfully\nmanaged to put his career back on track, delivering a stellar project\non which we hear him\nat his most versatile,\nrapping frankly, openly and honestly about\nthe various wins he\u2019s\nenjoyed and losses he\u2019s\nendured. I would argue\nthat the Drake beef ultimately helped Meek\nmore than it did Drake,\nrenewing his focus and\nforcing fans to realise\nexactly what they were\nmissing whilst he was\nsilent. The reaction of\nthe hip-hop community\nto Meek\u2019s recent rein-carceration for violating\nparole, which sparked\nthe wider conversation\nsurrounding parole in\nthe American criminal\njustice system, is proof\nthat hip-hop culture has\nwidely accepted Meek\nMill again.\nantics more entertaining\nand appealing than his\nmusic but, as a casual\nfan of his music, I was\npleasantly surprised\nto hear a more ma-ture-sounding Tyler discuss themes including\ndepression, loneliness\nand his sexuality on\nthis smooth, introspective album. As his name\nsuggests, Tyler, The\nCreator, is a creative\nforce to be reckoned\nwith and the fact that he\nalso solely produced the\nentire album affirms his\nstanding as one of the\nculture\u2019s most creative\ninfluences. Flower Boy\nis fully deserving of its\n2018 Grammy nomination for \u201cBest Rap\nAlbum\u201d and, although\nhe is the underdog, it\nwould be brilliant to\nsee Tyler take home the\nGrammy for this excellent project.\n5\nCulture\nMigos\nFrom their signature\n\u2018Migos flow\u2019 infiltrating the mainstream to\nthe Atlanta trio popularising the \u2018dab\u2019, Migos\ndictates a lot of what\nhappens in hip-hop\nculture today. Migos is\naware of its wide-reach-ing influence and, thus,\nit\u2019s fitting that they\nchose the album title\nCulture: Migos is the\nculture! The first half of\nCulture is arguably the\nstrongest of any album\nthis year, with four of\nmy favourite tracks this\nyear (T-Shirt, Call Casting, Get Right Witcha\nand Slippery) as well as\nthe ubiquitous Bad and\nBoujee all coming within the first 25 minutes.\nMigos is the world\u2019s\nbiggest rap group and\ntheir chemistry is so\nevident that sometimes\nI question if Quavo,\nOffset and Takeoff all\nshare the same brain.\nAlthough they face stiff\ncompetition, part of me\nwants to see the three\nMigos take home the\n\u201cBest RapAlbum\u201d 2018\nGrammy for Culture.\n4\n4:44\nJay Z\nListening to projects\nfrom legendary veteran\nrappers can often be jar-ring. I sometimes feel\nlike their work must\nbe venerated because\nof everything they\u2019ve\nachieved. However, on\nthe other hand, it\u2019s usually abundantly clear\nthat this artist is past\nLaila\u2019s Wisdom // Genius\nMUSIC\nAndy Djaba\nMusic Editor\nFlower Boy// Pitchfork\nCulture// Genius\n4:44// HotNewHipHop\nFUTURE // DJBooth\nPretty Girls Like Trap Music// XXL\nWins & Losses //\nHotNewHipHop\n\u201c... it\u2019s fitting\nthat they chose\nthe album title\nCulture: Migos\nis the culture!\u201d\n6\nFlower Boy\nTyler, The Creator\nI\u2019ve always found Tyler\u2019s wacky, hilarious\ntheir prime and it can\neven be cringeworthy to\nhear them attempt to reproduce their previous\nmagic or attempt to remain relevant by jumping on the latest popular\nwave. With it being four\nyears since the release\nof his distinctly less\nthan spectacular Magna\nCarta Holy Grail, I can\nforgive anyone for expecting Jay Z to fall into\nthe aforementioned cat-egory. However, Jay Z\nexpertly avoids this on\n4:44, delivering a truly\nstunning, more personal\nalbum of mature, soulful\nand emotional content.\nAlthough Jay has spent\nover two decades at the\npinnacle of hip-hop and\nhis career has been one\nof remarkable, unprecedented consistency, I\nfeel that he has always\nkept fans at arm\u2019s length\nto some extent, portraying himself as a hustler\nand the living embodiment of swag, but rarely\nletting us know what he\nis dealing with beneath\nthe surface.\nFor this reason, I sometimes find it difficult to\nconnect with his music\non a deeper, emotional\nlevel. On 4:44, Jay Z finally dedicates a whole\nalbum to showing vul-nerability, rapping\nhonestly and addressing\nhis infidelity and marital struggles. The album\nis also full of gems, with\nJay giving the younger\ngeneration business advice focused on diversifying assets, investing in and supporting\nblack business in order\nto build generational\nwealth within the black\ncommunity. Music journalist Tour\u00e9 claimed,\n\u201cfor hip-hop to continue to thrive, there must\nbe a true adult wing for\nthe grown folks who\nloved hip-hop in its early years but now have\nfamilies and no time to\ngo to the clubs\u2026\u201d and,\nat 48 years old (practi-cally a pensioner as far\nas rap is concerned), it\u2019s\nrefreshing to see Jay Z\ncontinue to push the\nculture forward. The\nalbum\u2019s brevity is the\nonly reason 4:44 hasn\u2019t\nlanded higher on this\nlist but Jay\u2019s induction\ninto the Songwriters\nHall of Fame and the\neight Grammy nominations received by 4:44\nare simply more accolades to embellish his\nalready storied career.\n3\nMore Life\nDrake\nAlthough it isn\u2019t immediately obvious, Drake\nis currently undergoing\nthe most difficult period of his career so far.\nEver since Drake rose\nto mainstream prominence in 2009, he has\nlived a charmed life. He\nrapidly rose to the summit of hip-hop and he\u2019s\nsat there ever since, as\nevidenced by his omnipresence on the Billboard Hot 100 (Drake\nhad a song in the charts\nevery week for the past\neight years). However, with his astounding\nBillboard streak coming\nto an end this year and\nconsidering the somewhat lukewarm reception to his latest offer-ing, More Life, could\nthis be confirmation that\nDrake has peaked, and\nhis career is about to begin a slow decline? Will\nwe see Drizzy\u2019s impact\non the culture diminish?\nRegardless, I still think\nMore Life is a great\nproject and was an improvement on 2016\u2019s\nViews. Drake tows the\nline between appropriation and showing appreciation perfectly on this\nproject, paying homage\nto his numerous musical\ninfluences. These musical influences include\nthe Afro-Caribbean\nand UK music scenes.\nTracks like \u2018KMT\u2019,\n\u2018Sacrifices\u2019 and \u2018Passionfruit\u2019 are amongst\nmy favourites from this\nyear and I\u2019m convinced\nDrake still has a few\nmore years at the top of\nhip-hop.\n2\nALL-AMERIKKKAN\nBADA$$\nJoey Bada$$\nWith ALL-AMERIKKKAN BADA$$, Joey\nBada$$ arguably delivered a more important\nmessage through his\nmusic than that which\nwe have heard from any\nother album in 2017.\nThe album is an abra-sive, politically charged\nbody of work that takes\naim at white America, white supremacy\nand, of course, Donald\nTrump. It is refreshing\nto hear such social consciousness and activism\nfrom one of the younger rappers in the game,\nwith Joey recognising\nthe responsibility he\nhas as an artist to shed\nlight on issues such as\ncorruption in the media\nand the American judicial and criminal justice\nsystems. Joey does this\nall without abandoning\nhis musical excellence\nand his dedication to\nbars and lyrical ability,\nthe lifeblood of real hip-hop.\n1\nDAMN.\nKendrick Lamar\nIf you didn\u2019t already\nknow that I would\npick Kendrick Lamar\u2019s\nDAMN. as my hip-hop\nalbum of the year, then\nyou don\u2019t really know\nme at all.\nFor those who don\u2019t\nknow, I am a Kendrick\nstan. However, this\nis not why DAMN. Is\n2017\u2019s best hip-hop album in my opinion. In\nDAMN., Kendrick crafted a masterpiece which\ncemented his position\nas the greatest rapper\nalive. It is a completely\nunique listening expe-rience, almost serving\nas an amalgamation of\nthe highs of his previous classic offerings,\nSection 80, good kid,\nm.A.A.d city\u201d and To\nPimp a Butterfly.\nDAMN. also sees Kendrick reinvent his\nsound, moving away\nfrom the jazz/funk influences of his previous\nstorytelling, conceptual\nmaintaining his artistic\nintegrity. The now dou-ble-platinum DAMN. is\n2017\u2019s highest selling\nalbum, shifting 603,000\nunits and debuting atop\nthe Billboard 200 chart\nin its first week.\nDAMN. feels like an instant classic and, despite\nthe album dropping almost eight months ago,\nI still stumble across the\nsubtle nuances hidden\nDAMN.// HipHopDX\nMore Life // HotNewHipHop\nALL-AMERIKKKAN\nBADA$$// HotNewHipHop\n\u201cOn 4:44,\nJay Z finally\ndedicates a\nwhole album\nto showing\nvulnerability,\nrapping\nhonestly and\naddressing\nhis infidelity\nand marital\nstruggles\u201d\n\u201cAlthough it\nisn\u2019t obvious,\nDrake is\ncurrently\nundergoing\nthe most\ndifficult period\nof his career so\nfar\u201d\n\u201cIt is refreshing\nto hear\nsuch social\nconsciousness\nand activism\nfrom one of\nthe younger\nrappers in the\ngame\u201d\n\u201cDAMN. is\n2017\u2019s highest\nselling album,\nshifting\n603,000 units\u201d\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t\nalready know\nthat I would\npick Kendrick\nLamar\u2019s DAMN.\nas my hip-hop\nalbum of the\nyear, then you\ndon\u2019t really\nknow me at\nall\u201d\nalbums and achieving\ncommercial success\nwith tracks like \u2018LOYALTY.\u2019, \u2018LOVE.\u2019 and\n\u2018HUMBLE.\u2019, all while\nbeneath Kendrick\u2019s delicately woven, dexterous lyrics. For instance,\nI\u2019m still not sure what\nhe\u2019s talking about when\nhe repeats \u201cWhat happens on Earth stays on\nEarth\u201d throughout the\nalbum or who the blind\nwoman on the album\u2019s\nintro track, \u2018BLOOD.\u2019\nis meant to represent.\nMaybe I\u2019m not \u2018woke\u2019\nenough to fully understand it yet. Maybe\nKendrick is trolling and\nthere actually isn\u2019t a\ndeeper meaning or symbolism behind some of\nhis lyrics. Who knows?\nAll I know is that this\nalbum is exceptional.\nIt will be interesting to\nsee whether Kendrick\nor Jay Z comes home\nwith the \u201cBest Rap Album\u201d and/or \u201cAlbum of\nthe Year\u201d 2018 Grammy for their respective\nalbums, but it\u2019s obvious\nwhich album would get\nmy vote.\n\n"

We then went back\nto College and found\nflights on SkyScanner to\nIstanbul \u2013 we had aimed\nto make it to the Greece/\nCyprus area, so this was\nperfect. However, we\nneeded to raise some\nmore money, so we went\nback to fundraising. We\nfinished at 8pm and went\nstraight to the airport.\nF: What was the hardest bit of the journey?\nBM: Definitely the\nfinal two hours before\nthe flight departed. After\nan extremely intense day\nof fundraising, we quite\nliterally sprinted back\nto Blackett, and found a\nrange of possible desti-nations. Once we settled\non the flight to South\nAfrica, we realized it was\n1 hour and 45 minutes\ntill the flight departed.\nAfter spending a total of\n4 minutes packing for our\njourney to the other side\nof the world, we dashed\nto the airport in an Uber.\nWe weren't sure if we'd\nmake it to the terminal in\ntime, but we took the risk\nand went ahead with the\ntickets. Fast forward 20\nminutes: we arrived at the\nwrong terminal, and were\nconstantly trying to call\nEmirates for the possibility of changing the flight.\nWe took our chances\nagain and sprinted with\nour luggage for 7 minutes\nstraight till we arrived,\ndrenched in sweat, at the\ncustomer service desk\nwho, after explaining that\nthis was a charity com-petition, kindly opened\nup the gates for us to let\nto continue our mad dash\nto the airplane. We didn't\nknow we had this much\ncardio in us.\nJS: The hardest part\nwas the time constraint\nof raising enough money\nbefore we went to the\nairport and making it to\nthe flight.\nF: What tips would\nyou give to others?\nBM: We weren\u2019t afraid\nto try new things and be\ncreative \u2013 we would walk\nstraight into comfy 5-star\nhotels and take the lift to\nfundraise in the executive\nlounges. People were\nsurprisingly OK with this.\nWe also took a genuine\ninterest in the people we\nwere talking to. Jailbreak\nis pretty much the only\nexcuse you get to know the\npeople of London at this\nscale, so trying to build a\ngenuine connection with\nthe people you\u2019re talking\nto goes a long way in persuading them to donate.\nOur main advice would\nbe to really try to make\nJailbreak your own and\ndon't be afraid of trying\nnew things. If a certain\ndelivery isn't working,\nswitch it; if you're getting\ntired, grab a coffee. And\nbe very wary of holding\nfalse preconceptions\nabout what is and isn't\npossible!\nJS: People are really\nnice and if you're confident and nice back, they\nend up being really gener-ous. The first woman we\nspoke to offered us a free\nbus ride to Southampton\nthat evening if we hadn't\nmanaged to do any better.\nFundraising will be\ncompleted on by Saturday,\n9th\nof December.\nBrownian Motion chilling on the beach in Cape Town // Brownian Motion\nStudents make it to Cape Town on RAG Jailbreak\nNEWS\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\n\n"

Having\nstudied both before and\nbeing a fan of Dal\u00ed, I was\ninterested to know what\nthey had in common.\nPerhaps this is a late\nrealisation, but I learnt\nthat the two were close\nfriends, often staying at\neach other\u2019s residence\nwhen visiting and in\nregular correspondence.\nThe exhibition was\nbrilliantly curated, with\nworks on similar themes\nplaced next to each other,\nallowing viewers to\nclearly see their influence\non each other\u2019s art.\nIn general, this has been\na good year for theatre \u2013\nshows of high standard\nthat continue to run at the\nWest End, blockbuster\nproductions that are\nrelevant to the political\nclimate. But happily, this\nhas also been a good year\nfor art exhibitions \u2013 shows\nthat are well-curated and\ntell a good story. Let\u2019s see\nif this trend continues in\n2018.\nIndira Mallik\nT\nhis year was\nmeant to save us\nfrom what was\ngenerally agreed\nto be the worst year ever,\n2016, and in some ways\nit has (fewer beloved\ncelebrities went to the\nHollywood in the sky), in\nother ways of course, it\u2019s\nbeen equally as terrible\n\u2013 we\u2019ve needed some\nquality distraction. Pure\nescapism however has not\nbeen on the card, In these\nincreasingly political\ntimes, the art world too\nseems to have gotten more\npolitical.\nThe Tate\u2019s blockbuster\nshow Soul of a Nation:\nArt in the Age of Black\nPower, a highlight of the\nsummer, put a spotlight on\nthe entrenched racism of\nthe Civil Rights Era, and\nparticularly with regards\nto the art created in\nresponse to acts of police\nbrutality, drew parallels\nto the present day \u2013 highlighting how far America\nhas come, and how much\nfarther it still has to go.\nBetye Saar\u2019s assemblages\nwere some of the most\npowerful of the show \u2013 in\none particularly haunting\npiece entitled I\u2019ve Got\nRhythm the skeleton of a\nlynched black man swung\nin a coffin-like metronome case lined with a\n(real) newspaper clipping\nthat explained the man\u2019s\nfate \u2013 hanged for refusing\nto dance. It\u2019s wasn\u2019t all\ntragedy and rage \u2013 Barkley\nL. Hendrick\u2019s self-portrait\non aluminium Icon for My\nMan Superman was effer-vescently cool, grounded\nboth in the religious\niconography of medieval\nart and present day pop\nculture. Its\u2019 irreverence\nand wry observations\nwere echoed in the works\ndisplayed at the Tate\nBritain for Queer British\nArt 1861-1967. In equal\nparts poignant and joyous,\nthe exhibition was an ode\nto the constantly evolving\nqueer communities and\nthe wider society that has\nevolved around them.\nThe curation did well to\nput the works in context,\nwith detailed notes about\nthe artists and the events\nsurrounding the work\naccompanying each piece,\nfor many of the pieces\non display, the stories\nbehind the works alone\nwere worth the price of\nadmission.\nJust as 2017 has proved\na good year for the visual\narts, it has been a vintage\nyearforLondon\u2019stheatres.\nSpecial mentions must go\nto Oslo, the play about\nthe eponymous Accords\nthat brought peace to the\nMiddle East (for a time),\nand the Norwegian couple\nthat masterminded it, was\nmasterful, managing to\nweave a tense yarn from\na complex bit of political\nhistory. We might\u2019ve\nexpected it to be a bit of\na thriller, but it was also\nsurprisingly funny, the\nlaugh-out-loud moments\nelevating an already\nengaging performance.\nBeginnings, also at the\nNational Theatre dealt\nwith more personal\npolitics. Now at the Ambassadors Theatre after a\nswift West End transfer,\nit signalled a triumphant\nreturn for playwright\nDavid Eldridge, who, in\nthis achingly funny but\nwonderfully tender play,\nexplores love in the age of\nTinder with a Tennessee\nWilliams-esque incisive-ness.\nThe arts event of\nthe year for me goes to\nanother NT production.\nTony Kushner\u2019s \u2018gay\nfantasia\u2019 about the AIDS\ncrisis, Angels in America\nboasted a star-studded cast\nin Nathan Lane, Andrew\nGarfield, and Russell\nTovey, but it was their\nlesser known co-stars,\nNathan Stewart-Jarrett\nand Denise Gough, who\nstole the show as Belize\nand Harper respectively\n\u2013 pathos dripped from\nboth their performances \u2013\nwhen Garfield\u2019s delivery\ngot a bit too overblown,\nStewart-Jarrett grounded\nit with sublime natural-ism. Kushner\u2019s script:\nmeditative, and lyrical\n\u2013 sweeping across time\nand space, from Heaven\nto New York to Antarctica, and back again \u2013 was\na call to arms when it was\nfirst performed. The NT\u2019s\nsuperb restaging was\na reminder that twenty\nyears later, Kushner\u2019s\nvoice is just as potent.\nDenise Gough and Andrew Garfield in Angels in America // Helen Maybanks\n2017 in review: the Arts editors take you through the\nArts editors Adam Gellatly, Jingjie Cheng, and Indira\nMallik give their highlights of the year \u2013 expect rave\nreviewsofAngelsinAmerica,blockbusterartexhibitions\nand a theatre experience like no other...\n\u201cSo much\noccured during\nthe six hours,\nit is impossible\nto praise every\nsuperbly\nexecuted\nelement\u201d\nAdam Gellatly\nI\nt\u2019s a strange feeling,\nwhen you feel like\nyou know an artist,\nthat you have a reasonable understanding of\nhis work, to then discover\nhim afresh. But exactly\nwhat I experienced at Tate\nBritain in February, when\nthe gallery put on the\nlargest ever arrangement\nof Hockney\u2019s work.\nDavid Hockney, The\nExhibition, followed the\nartist\u2019s work from his\nearliest days as a student\nto his 2016 iPad drawings.\nHere, backlit screens\ndisplay not only the final\nproduct but also the evolution of the drawings in the\nform of screen-captured\nvideos. It\u2019s rare to have\nthe opportunity to see any\nartist\u2019s mind in action,\nlet alone one of Britain\u2019s\ngreat modern painters.\nOf course, many of\nHockney\u2019s most famous\nworks were on display:\nA Bigger Splash (1967),\nAmerican Collectors\n(1968), Mr and Mrs Clark\nand Percy (1970-1), Pearblossom Hwy. (1986). But\nthe real enjoyment came\nfrom discovering for the\nfirst time \u2013 along with, I\nimagine, everyone else\nin the room \u2013 his smaller\npieces and sketches that\nlater found life in his mas-terpieces. Stumbling upon\na small piece of triangular\ngraph paper, on which\nHockney had sketched a\ncrude palm tree and car\n\u2013 aptly titled The Great\nPyramid with Palm Tree\nand Car (1963) \u2013 only\nto later realise it served\nas the draft for his great\nGreat Pyramid at Giza\nwith Broken Head from\nThebes later that year\ninstilled in me a boyish\nsense of adventure. I was\nessentially an art detective\nfor a few hours, which\nmeans I was essentially\nInspector Clouseau. Pretty\ncool, huh?\nWhere do I begin with\nmy theatre highlight of the\nyear: Roman Tragedies\nwas an experience like\nno other Let me set the\nscene: Enobarbus, Mark\nAntony\u2019s closest confidant has just betrayed\nthe great Roman general.\nSo overcome with grief\nis he with his actions, he\ndcides to take his own life.\nHis cries and pleas for\nforgiveness are translated\nfrom Dutch to English\ncourtesy of surtitles. A\ncameraman follows him\nas he stumbles across\nthe stage; his lamenting\nprojected above the set for\nthe audience gawk over.\nSuddenly, he exits\nstage left and proceeds to\nbound up the stairs, past\nthe stalls, cameraman in\npursuit. The live video\nfeed continues as Enobarbus meanders out of the\nBarbican onto the road.\nAs he continues to confess\nhis sins, a member of the\npublic appears on the\nfootpath. He is carrying\nhis shopping and stops\ndead at the sight of man\nrolling in the tarmac,\nyelling in Dutch. The\ncamera zooms in on the\nperplexed face of the pas-ser-by, to the joy of every\nmember of the audience.\nEventually, Enobarbus\nreturns to the stage, still\nin hysterics, where he\nproceeds to end his suffer-ing. \u201cEnobarbus 81 \u2013 31\nBC\u201d reads the caption, as\na bird\u2019s-eye view of the\ngeneral\u2019s body is met with\nraucous applause.\nGoing into this one, I\nwasn\u2019tsurewhattoexpect.\nA 6-hour-long, modern\nday adaptation of Coriolanus, Julius Caesar, and\nAntony and Cleopatra, all\nin Dutch (with English\nsurtitles, thank God), and\nthe ability to walk onto\nthe stage during the per-formance. So, just a little\nstrange then.\nIt was surreal, no doubt,\nbut Roman Tragedies was\nalso the most incredible\ntheatrical performance I\nhave ever had the joy of\nwitnessing. The adaptations were set in a sprawling political conference\nroom, with declarations\nof war framed as heated\ndebates. TV screens were\nadorned with footage\nfrom real world news, and\nrolling headlines filled\nthe audience in on action\nthat has had to be skipped\nin the interest of time.\nCameras \u2013 both manned\nand stationary - followed\nthe actors wherever they\nwent, providing an essential perspective into the\naction when the characters\nfind themselves buried in a\nsea of audience members.\nIt was like watching a particularly intense episode\nof The Thick of It, live.\nSo much occurred\nduring the six hours, it is\nimpossible to praise every\nsuperbly planned and\nexecuted element. Nor\nwas it possible to witness\nthem all; each audience\nmember chose to view\nthe show differently, and\neach audience member\u2019s\nexperience was unique.\nToneelgroep Amsterdam stage performances\nof Roman Tragedies at\nvarious venues every\nyear. If you ever get the\nopportunity to see it for\nyourself, do not (do not!)\npass it by.\nJingjie Cheng\nT\nhis year saw the\narrival of several\nb l o c k b u s t e r\nshows and ex-hibitions, most notably\nAngels in America,\nwhich undoubtedly was\nthe best show I\u2019ve seen\nthis year by far. Lavishly\nextending across a two-part show, with regular\ntickets sold out days after\nthey were released, Angels\nin America was certainly\nthe National Theatre\u2019s\nflagship show of 2017.\nNot to mention Andrew\nGarfield\u2019s incredible per-formance. A production\nof Tony Kushner\u2019s AIDS\ndrama, one that champions a progressive society\nand rejects marginalisa-tion, resonates even more\nin a difficult year like this,\nfollowing 2016. As far as\nart exhibitions are con-cerned, Basquiat: Boom\nfor Real was an adventurous undertaking by\nthe Barbican, significant\nbecause it is the first time\nthat the young artist\u2019s (he\ndied age 27 of a heroin\noverdose) body of work\nhas been shown all in one\nplace. Revolving around\ndifferent aspects of his\nlife and the post-punk,\nhip-hop, street art culture\nof which his work is a\npart of, the exhibition is\na snapshot of Manhattan\nin the last 1970s from a\nunique perspective, in a\nriot of colours and ideas.\nSpeaking of colours,\nCasanova was a brilliant\nballet by the Northern\nBallet, which travelled\nacross the UK from Leeds\n(where they are based)\nto London to Edinburgh.\nOstentatious and grand,\nthis ballet pulled out all\nthe stops on a magnificent\nset, colourful costumes\nand intricate props. The\nNorthern Ballet specialises in ballet that tells\na story \u2013 and indeed,\nthis production told the\nepic story of seductive\nCasanova very well,\nweaving complex visual\nnarration with perfect\nchoreography.\nThis year also saw\nseveral transfers to the\nWest End of successful\nshows by the National\nTheatre and Royal\nCourt \u2013 The Ferryman\nwas transferred after an\nimmensely successful\nsold out run at the Royal\nCourt. I was surprised to\nsee it doing so well and\nthriving on the West End,\ngiven its gravity and so-cio-political themes \u2013 not\na light-hearted or heartwarming story by any\nmeasure. Nevertheless, I\nenjoyed it for being just\nthat: serious, and tackling\na problematic history with\nsensitivity. Its massive\ncast was delightful, as\nwere the real animals and\nbabies on stage.

The review,\nwas prompted by \u201ca\nseries of events involving\nthe men\u2019s student rugby\nteam\u201d, which reached a\nnadir with accusations of\nsexism at Varsity 2015.\nThe report found many\ninstances of bullying\nand discrimination at\nImperial, which were\nlargely linked to sexism\nand homophobia \u2013 one\nparticipant said that the\n\u201cingrained misogyny\u201d at\nImperial was \u201cso deep that\nit had become normal\u201d.\nHow did we get to this\npoint? Some sociologists\nmay point to the rise\nof the \u2018lad mag\u2019 in the\n1990s, which promoted\nobjectification of women,\nas an explanation for the\nnascent \u2018lad culture\u2019 that\ncan be found across many\nuniversity campuses\n\u2013 indeed, a report by\nthe National Union of\nStudents found that\ncontemporary lad culture\nwas contextualised by the\nincreasing proportion of\nwomen in higher educa-tion, which some theorists\nhad led to a kick-back by\nthose who felt their masculinity was threatened.\nAt Imperial, at least,\nthis is nothing new. The\narchives of Felix will\nshow you that women\nhave faced extreme hostility on campus for attempting to put forward ideas\nof equality. The debates\nthat raged over the Union\nBar in the 20th\ncentury\nare one example: until at\nleast 1974, women were\nnot allowed in the Union\nBar \u2013 or rather, there were\nnever any rules against it,\nbut men would stop them\nentering. A Felix article\nof that year talks about\nKay Nickelson, the first\nfemale captain of an ACC\nclub (fencing, in case you\nwere interested), but who\nwas unable to use her\ntankard, since she was\n\u201cnot allowed in the Union\nBar\u201d. In the same issue, a\nletter from a male student\nsays that while he can\u2019t\nsee any reason for women\nto be banned, he also can\u2019t\nsee what right \u201ca few\nwomen in IC [have to]\ndemand that the average\nIC student stop enjoying\nhimself\u201d.\nFive years before this,\na paper was presented to\nUnion Council to allow\nwomen into the Bar, but\nit was defeated \u2013 the\nproposer was met with\n\u201cpandemonium, paper\ndarts, and cries of \u2018off\u2019\u201d,\nwhile one opposition\nmember said that \u201cthe\nactivities in the Union\nBar were not for women\nto see or hear\u201d. Another\nmotion was raised two\nyears later, which would\nprevent any form of discrimination against those\nusing the Union Bar, but\nit failed \u2013 Council had\n\u201coverwhelmingly\u201d voted\nto include an amendment\nthat \u201call persons entering\nthe Bar be naked from the\nwaist up\u201d.\nWhen the usual procedures failed, a number of\nstudents turned to more\nradical means, \u2018invading\u2019\nthe Union Bar against the\nwill of its male patrons: in\n1969, Women\u2019s Lib and\nGay Lib attempted to enter\nthe Bar, but were \u201ckicked\nout\u201d, and a couple of\nyears later Women\u2019s Lib\nattempted to gain entry to\nthe Bar again. When they\ntried to enter the Bar the\nsame night as the Chap\u2019s\nClub Dinner \u2013 one of\nImperial\u2019s historical \u2018tie\nclubs\u2019, which at the time\nwas affiliated with RSMU\n\u2013 one woman had two\npints of beer poured over\nher. The men then tried to\nforce her to down a yard\nof beer, at which point she\npoured it over the head of\nthe RCSU President, and\nwas forcibly removed. .\nWhile it would be easy\nto place the entirety of the\nblame on the men in the\nUnion Bar, when you go\nthrough these articles you\nrealise how sexist and discriminatory some of the\nlanguage used by Felix\nwriters was. Women\u2019s\nunderwear used to be\nhung over the bar, and\nany attempts to remove\nthem stopped. The issue\nwas described as \u201ctrivial\u201d,\nwhile women trying to\nget into the Bar are characterised as \u201caggressive\u201d.\nIn one article, one of the\nWomen\u2019s Lib members\ncomplains about the\nadvances made by \u201chorny\nold perverts present in the\nbar\u201d, at which point the\nwriter inserts their own\nopinion: \u201cmaybe this is\nwhy we keep women out\nof the Bar.\u201d\nA culture of inequality\ndoes not come out of\nnowhere. While women\nmight be more welcome\nin the Union Bar today,\nlast year\u2019s report shows\nwe have a long way to go.\nMany thanks to Mental\nHealth Liberation Officer\nAriana Sadr-Hashemi\nfor her research for this\narticle.\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m up\nto at the moment!\nM\ny role as Gender Equality\nOfficer is to combat and raise\nawareness of issues regarding\ngender equality, from sexism\nand unconscious bias to sexual harassment.\nI want to create an inclusive environment at\nImperial, where all genders are represented\nand can carry out their studies without the\nthreat of harassment in any form.\nI am in the process of proposing a\nconfidential and straightforward platform\nthat could be found on the Imperial app\nor online, for reporting incidents of sexism,\nsexual harassment, or assault at Imperial.\nCurrently, there is no clear guidance for\nmembers of the college who want to report\nincidents of this nature and in trying to do\nso they are likely to undergo a lengthy and\ncomplicated process, before they can even\nbegin to get the action and support they\ndeserve. Through this platform, I hope to\nremove the barriers that stand in the way of\npeople reporting incidents, whilst ensuring\nthat the reporting process brings effective\naction, with no trauma to the victim.\nNext term,Iamplanningtorunacampaign\non everyday sexism and unconscious bias,\nbut if you have any campaigns that you\nwant to run regarding gender equality (or\njust any questions/ideas you want to let\nme know about!) send me an email on icu-gender-equality@ic.ac.uk.\nThrough working with the careers service,\nthere will now be a set of workshops at the\nend of this academic year, designed to help\nwomen excel in the world of interviews,\nnegotiating and work \u2013 so keep an eye out\nfor these if you are interested!\nLIBERATION\nAnna Wilson\nGender Equality Officer\nMisoginy at Imperial is nothing new // Felix\n\n"

Further reports\nhave also been coming\nthrough of an increase in\nbike thefts across campus-es, as well as numerous\ninstances of students\nbeing pickpocketed in the\nFusion queue as they try\nto decide between chicken\npilau and beef noodles.\nAs a result of these\nincidents the College have\ntaken what they described\nas \u201cunprecedented measures\u201d to ensure safety on\ncampus. Ethan Shadwell,\nVice-Provost (Broken\nWindows Theory) told\nFelix that \u201cit was time\nwe returned to the values\nof law and order. For too\nlong staff and students\nhave been feeling unsafe\non campus \u2013 why, many\nof us in the Faculty\nBuilding are too scared to\nleave our offices lest we\nrun into feral students. Do\nyou know how many lawsuits we\u2019ve had because\na Faculty employee has\nbumped into a student\nwho got lost in the Blue\nCube? Obviously you\ndon\u2019t, because we don\u2019t\npublish that information.\nBut it\u2019s been a lot, let me\nchanges beginning from\nthis week: the College\nhas hired Blackwater, a\nprivate security company,\nto patrol the campus 24\nhours a day, and from 1st\nJanuary 2018 a curfew\nwill be in effect, with\nstudents only allowed to\nmove around the campus\natsetpointsthroughoutthe\nday. Those who are found\nbreaking this curfew will\nbe placed in detention in\nthat giant silver cylinder\nin the foyer, which has\nbeen converted into a\ntemporary holding pen\nuntil new space opens up\nat Imperial White City\ncampus.\nOne student we spoke\nto welcomed the changes:\n\u201cI spend so much time in\nthe library and in win-dowless labs,\u201d he said,\n\u201cthat just going outside\nhas become an ordeal\nfor me.

The kick\nwas low, and ricocheted\noff his back straight back\ninto Parker\u2019s hands, who\nthen went on to race\ndown the touchline and\nscore the most memorable\ndebut try for the 1st\nteam\nin living history. 19-7.\nShuz, disappointed that\nhe was yet to be involved\nin this try-scoring flurry\nas this season\u2019s top try\nscorer (how did we let\nthis happen?) smashed\nover the line several\nphases later, giving us a\ncommanding 24-7 lead\nwith 20 minutes to go\nand securing the four-try\nbonus point.\nHowever, the game\nwas not yet won. Big\nNate, weighed down by\nthe pressure of not adding\nto his sc coefficient with\nthe Captain of Morale\nwatching him closely from\nthe side-line, buckled\nand went off with a knee\ninjury. Blackett tried to\nkeep the momentum going\nwith a quick tap penalty,\nceeded to our half, where\nour try line defence came\nunder pressure. The\nreferee, having penalised\nus on several occasions\nalready, sin binned prop\nMartin Head for having\nforgotten to pay his\ntransport fees. Due to\nhaving no uninjured front\nrow replacements left,\nwe were down to 13 men\nwith a scrum on our own\nfive metre line. Scrums\nwent uncontested and\nbacks were drafted into\nthe scrum. Brady tried\nto navigate his way into\nthe second row, took the\nwrong exit and ended up in\nSainsbury\u2019s an hour later.\nOnce the game resumed,\nIC battled to keep BARTS\nfrom scoring whilst\ntwo men down. With\ntwo-man tackles used to\nfull effect and a shed load\nof effort, the try line was\nmiraculously kept clear\nfor 9 minutes. However,\nnot to feel left out from\nall the sin-binning, Toby\nSimpson bubble-wrapped\nhis hand around a ball in\nthe middle of a ruck, only\nto be socked by the ref\nand sent for a 10 minute\nopportunity to reflect on\nwhether we\u2019d ever win a\ngame.

BARTS, sensing the\nopportunity for blood,\nattacked with renewed\nvigour. The game pro-nothing. We were back on\nthe front foot as fresher\nNick burst through the\nline for a 40 yard break.\nHis pass found a meandering trolley, who tried\nhis best to run it in, but\nsimply lacked the legs to\nfinish the job.

However,\nthe attack continued and,\nseveral phases later, the\nball was passed wide to\nAleksei Zaboronsky (who\nplayed the whole match\nat no. 8 by the way, mum\nand dad). He subsequently\nignored an easy two on\none and instead went for\nthe line himself, barely\nmaking his way over for\nthe try and hence completing the KES boy hattrick\n(shout out to Richard\nMahony). We now led\n29-14. With a minute\nremaining, on came Toby\nSimpson and we were\nback to 15 men.

Once again\nthe BARTS barrage\nresumed, but their game\nplan had no variation;\nthe defence adapted and\nsoon the gain line was\nbeing breached less and\nless, the tackles becoming\nmore and more dominant.\nFarmer Aynsley, tired of\nbeing the lesser known\nhousemate to agricultural\nmanure expert Simpson,\nran up and dump tackled\nBARTS\u2019 main runner.\nThe attack was shaken,\nand the tide began to turn.\nWith ball in hand, we\nwere looking more dan-gerous, and suddenly we\nwere camped in their 22,\ntrying to level the scores.\nSeveral attempts came\ntantalisingly close, only\nto be thrown away due to\nan overly optimistic out-the-back offload attempt\nfinally whipped the ball\nwide from a scrum, fly\nhalf James Field (clearly\njealous of Zaboronsky\u2019s\nreputation as the offload\nking) popped a no-look\nbackhand offload to the\ngrateful hands of Josh\nPope, who galloped his\nway over the line to\nfinally touchdown for\nImperial. With Field\nadding the extras, we\nwere tied at 7 apiece.\nThe momentum was with\nus.

Shortly after-wards, it was half-time. At\n7-7, there was everything\nto play for.\nThe second half kicked\noff, and the team hit their\nrhythm; the heaviest\ndethroned megs-master\nChopper, were carrying\nhard, the lineout was\nfiring on all cylinders, the\nbackline was tearing holes\nin the opposition every\nother play and the passes\nwere going to hand. The\nwind was now against\nus, but nonetheless a kick\nwent out in the corner and\nwe had a lineout 15 metres\nfrom their line. The move\nworked seamlessly and\nthe resulting driving\nmaul chugged its way\nforwards. The maul rolled\naround, the ball being\npassed from forward to\nforward until McGrail\nfinally dribbled his way\nover. The conversion was\ngood. 14-7 to us. From the\nkick-off, Polish cultural\nexpert Hallett smashed\nup a carry to get the team\nmoving forward.

Even if you don\u2019t, they\nare sure to enjoy this hilarious journal by ex-doctor, current comedian Adam Kay. In the\nmidst of clearing his old doctor possessions, Kay found\na box of journals that he had meticulously written as\na junior doctor, from the first day of work to the day\nhe quit. These snippets of hospital life show the gritty,\nsobering reality of working in the frontlines of the NHS\n\u2013 a great way to give friends and family working in\nhealthcare a warm hug to say\u2018we know what you go\nthrough\u2019.\nEven for non-healthcare workers, this is a colourful,\nirreverent account of a public service that we all\nencounter at some point in our lives - one that\ngives an alternative perspective on the profession.\nHowever, be warned \u2013 the story does not end as\nlightheartedly as it began, a reminder that ultimately\nthis is a profession that deals with life and death and\nthe very essence of humanity. -JC\nwith wonderful illusions. A considerable portion\nof the novel is dedicated to simply describing\nMorgernstern\u2019s beautiful inventions that it\nbecomes a visually stimulating, cinematic\nexperience. Every other sense is exploited as\neverything is given sumptuous detail. Les Cirque\ndes R\u00eaves is the perfect place to spend Christmas\n\u2013 a visit to the ice garden, warming your fingers\nby the bonfire, drinking hot chocolate and eating\nindulgent treats.

It\u2019s a mash of\nmundane things during a relationship without frills.\nThe characters are entirely plausible and it\u2019s here that\nI think Hanks will excel in the rest of the collection.\nObviously, we know Hanks best as an actor, a job he\ndoes astoundingly well. Surely, in essence, writing is\nthe same thing \u2013 bringing characters to an audience\nand making them believable \u2013 just by a different\nmedium. Even if he falls short on one story, you can\njust skip to the next. Maybe that would mean the\ncollection\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s a choice that is useful\nwhen giving a gift. The themes are broad, from the\nAmerican Dream to Christmas during World War II:\nthere\u2019s something to interest everyone. -AP\nThis is Going To Hurt, by Adam Kay\nsurprising finds like Amanda Dalton\u2019s \u2018How to\nDisappear\u2019, the poems are organised into chapters\nthat each address a different theme. For example,\n\u2018Body and Soul\u2019addresses existential thoughts and\nmeditations on the soul, \u2018In and out of love\u2019 sings\nof romance and heartbreak, while \u2018Growing up\u2019\naddresses childhood, family and finding oneself,\namong other themes.

Historically, the underground railroad\nwas a network of safe houses protecting runaway\nslaves, but in this novel its spirit manifests as a real-world railway, which Cora uses at various points in\nthe novel to escape cruelty and journey towards a\nmore hopeful future. The cruelty Cora experiences\nhighlights the thread of hope running through\nthe novel, making it even more poignant. I felt a\ngreat connection with Cora, with whom you will\nexperience the depths of despair and realise how\nresilient a person\u2019s spirit can be. -Katie Cook\nF\nrom its very first line \u2013 \u201cHistory has failed\nus, but no matter\u201d \u2013 Pachinko is a poignant\nand thoughtful story of resilience. In 1911,\nSunja, a young Korean girl with a humble\nbackground, must migrate to Japan to save her\nfamily from ruin. We learn of her struggles, and\nthose of the three generations that follow her.\nLee spent time in Japan speaking with people she\nmet in markets, learning about the lives of people\nwith Korean heritage, which clearly contributes to\nthe sense of reality in the novel. Sunja isn\u2019t very\nremarkable, but it\u2019s the honest characteristics\nof ordinary people that make her attractive and\ninteresting, as well as her subtle strength in the\nface of adversity. Even more modesty and truth\nis felt in novel the through the use of simple yet\nbeautiful writing. No frills, just the struggles and\nemotions of people. Pachinko is a success with\nmuch critical acclaim and deserves to be subject\nof more conversation. -Alice Peberdy\nMorning and Evening, by Jon Fosse\ntwists in the subtlest of ways. To call Anything in\nPossible a \u2018novel\u2019 is a misnomer: really it is a series\nof interconnected short stories, which build up to\na collective whole. Taking place in Strout\u2019s usual\nsetting of Maine, Anything is Possible shows how\nthe individual members of a society interact with\none another, and how communities are created.\nRichly detailed, but in prose that is measured and\nprecise, Strout may be the only writer who is able\nto come close to Alice Munro\u2019s mastery of writing\non domesticity. -Fred Fyles\nAnything is Possible, by Elizabeth\nStrout\nThe Underground Railroad, by Colson\nWhitehead\nPachinko, by Min Jin Lee\n/\n/\nD\nalkey Archive Press\n/\n/\nV\ni\nk\ni\nn\ng\n//Apollo\n/\n/\nD\no\nu\nb\nl\ne\nd\na\ny\nB\no\no\nk\ns\n\n"

Now,\nnearly a year later, the\nfirst phase of works are\ncoming to an end, with\nstudy spaces beginning to\nopen up on Levels 4 and\n5.\nWhile the move has\nbeen welcomed by\nstudents annoyed about\nthe temperature levels in\nCentral Library \u2013 Library\nServices has said temperature control was \u201cthe\nsingle biggest source\nof complaint from the\nstudent body for several\nyears\u201d \u2013 the works have\nfaced a number of delays.\nThe two floors were\nsupposed to be opened\nby the beginning of\nNovember, but will now\nface a \u201csoft\u201d opening as\nbooks are returned to their\nrightful shelves and new\nfurniture put in place.\nLibrary Services have\nalso been sharing images\nof the new plug sockets on\nsocial media \u2013 a welcome\nrelief for anyone who\u2019s\nexperienced the hunt for\na working socket in the\nLibrary.\nThe next phase of the\ndevelopment is scheduled\nto start in summer of\nnext year, as cooling and\nventilation systems are\ninstalled on Levels 2 and\n3. Similar to this year\u2019s\nworks, those levels will\nbe closed off as the renovations occur. The total\ndevelopment is scheduled\nto cost \u00a311 million.\nControversial \u2018Tie\nClubs\u2019paper passed\nThis March, arguments\naround the use of Union\nstorage space for tankards\nbelonging to \u2018Tie Clubs\u2019\narose in Union Council.\nThe clubs, which include\nthe 22 Club, the Chaps\nClub, and the Links Club,\namong others, mainly\nfunction as social socie-ties.\nA paper was raised\nin Council, arguing that\ntie clubs should not be\nallowed to make use\nof Union facilities and\nstorage until they had\nproven that they adhered\nto the Union\u2019s Equal Opportunities Policy. Some\nstudents had expressed\nconcern that tie clubs\nwere discriminatory\nin their membership\npolicies; a number of tie\nclub members denied this\ncharge, saying they let in\nstudents of all genders.\nAn amended version\nof the paper was passed,\nwhich stated that any\ngroups storing tankards\nwould not be allowed to\nbreach the Union\u2019s Safe\nSpace Policy, and did\nnot single out tie clubs in\nparticular. The paper was\npassed by a large major-ity, and Felix believe a\nchallenge has been made\nagainst the 22 Club to\nshow they adhere to the\nSafe Space Policy within\nthe next two months.\nTEF applications\nThis year marked\nthe introduction of the\n\"Teaching Excellence\nFramework\" (TEF), a\ngovernment assessment\nof the quality of higher\neducation providers. Imperial achieved Gold, the\nhighest level possible.\nTEF has not been\nwithout its controversies:\ndeveloped by the Department of Education, it is\ndescribed as a \u201cscheme\nfor recognising excellent\nteaching\u201d, but initially\nwas scheduled to be\nlinked to tuition fees. A\nuniversity that achieved\nthe highest level of TEF\nwould be able to increase\ntheir tuition fees in line\nwith inflation.\nFor Imperial College\nUnion, the proposals\npresented a dilemma:\nwhile they had adopted\na proposal to oppose any\nincrease in tuition fees or\nmarketisation of higher\neducation, by involving\nthemselves with TEF the\nUnion would be able to\nshape College policy. Following an extraordinary\nCouncil meeting at the\nbeginning of January, a\nmotion to engage with\nCollege on TEF was\npassed with minor amend-ments. Imperial gained\ntheir TEF Gold status in\nJune.\nHowever, in October of\nline with inflation. Recent\nstudies have also found\nthat the majority of students \u2013 while welcoming\nevaluation of a university\u2019s quality \u2013 do not\nbelieve that TEF should\nbe linked to tuition fees.\nSmoke Free\nImperial implemented\na smoking ban across all\nCollege campuses and\nproperties from the 1st\nof\nAugust.\nThe move, which had\nbeen discussed for over a\nyear, took place following\na referendum. Around\n750 students took part in\nthe referendum, of which\nthe majority thought that\nsmoking should be banned\non campus. A working\ngroup then made the\ndecision to ban smoking\nwithin 20m of all College\nland. It is unclear how the\nban is being enforced \u2013 a\nCollege spokesperson told\nFelix that it would \u201cnot be\nCentral Library, just before works starts // Felix\n\u201cTwo levels of\nthe library are\ndue to reopen\nthis week,\nas books are\nmoved back to\ntheir places\u201d\nthis year, Prime Minister\nTheresa May announced\nthat tuition feed would\nbe capped at \u00a39,250\nuntil 2019, negating any\nopportunity for TEF Gold\nuniversities to raise fees in\nBring back our breakfasts! // Flickr\nAs the year draws to a close, we take a look back at what's happened at Imperial for the past 12 months. Expect\ntie clubs, cooked breakfasts, and library closures\naround campus this year\nprincipally the responsibility of security staff\u201d,\nbut would be implemented with the cooperation\nof staff and students. The\nCollege said that the ban\nwas an attempt to fulfil\ntheir \u201cduty of care to staff\nand students\u201d.\nThose returning to\nImperial this autumn\nwere greeted by a number\nof large signs that had\npopped up around\ncampus, informing them\nof the changes. Felix has\nheard reports that several\nof these signs have since\nbeen taken home by\nstudents, with one turning\nup in the Fulham Slug and\nLettuce.\nWoodward Buildings\nfails fire safety tests\nThe cladding system\nused in Woodward Buildings, one of Imperial\u2019s\nnewest student halls,\nfailed fire safety tests\ncarried out this summer.\nThe tests were ordered by\nthe government following\nthe tragic fire in Greenfell\nTower, which killed 70\npeople.\nThe results of the tests\nwere revealed to the halls\u2019\n690 occupants via an\nsentence in which they\nsaid the actual reason for\nwriting the letter\u201d. Woodward Buildings were the\nonly Imperial halls with\ncladding that failed tests,\nalthough nearly 200 other\nbuildings across the UK\nhad failed tests.\nCooked breakfast\nremoved from SCR\nmenu\nPostgraduate students\nlooking forward to\ntucking into the Senior\nCommon Room\u2019s (SCR)\ncooked breakfast this year\nwere left disappointed,\nwith Imperial\u2019s Campus\nServices removing the\noption amid wide-ranging\nchanges to services.\nAs well as removing\ncooked breakfasts, the\nCollege increased prices\nacross all outlets operated\nby Campus Services,\nreviewed their portion\nsizes, reduced the range\nof options on offer, and\ncut the opening times of\na number of their outlets.\nThe move provoked\ncriticism from staff and\nstudents, with one staff\nmember saying \u201cthe\nfact is that catering is\nnow less varied and less\naffordable\u201d, and another\ntelling Felix \u201cit sounds\nlike [when the College\ntalk about] reducing their\ncost, it\u2019s really coming out\nof our pocket.\u201d\nChanges to opening\nhours also came under\nfire: overall, during term\ntime, campus outlets will\nbe open for ten fewer\nhours a day. Ethos gym\nalso changed its out-of-term opening hours,\ncutting them by 18 hours\na week, a move that\ndisproportionately affects\npostgraduate students and\nstaff. One staff member\ntold Felix that in the last\nten years their experience\nat Imperial had been\n\u201cunfortunately worse and\nworse\u201d.\nCampus Services\ndefended the changes,\nsaying that their catering\nfacilities operated at a\nloss, and that Ethos was\nused by fewer people\noutside of term time,\nhence the change to hours.\nIn October, Imperial\nCollege Union launched a\nsurvey in response to these\nchanges, asking students\nto give their thoughts on\noutlet opening hours; the\nresults of this survey are\nyet to be announced.\nImperial fall in People\nand Planet League\nTables\nImperial plummeted\nin the People and Planet\nleague tables \u2013 published\nthis November \u2013 which\nrank universities based on\nenvironmental and ethical\ncriteria. They dropped\nfrom 96th to 141st in the\nrankings, making them\nbottom of the Russell\nGroup, with a score of\n18.5% \u2013 this earned them\na \u2018failed\u2019 rating.\nImperial\u2019s results,\nwhich were based on a\nnumber of metrics, were\ndescribed as \u201centirely fair\u201d\nand \u201cunsurprising\u201d by a\nnumber of students, who\nhighlighted the amount\nImperial has invested in\nfossil fuel companies.\nPeople and Planet reported that Imperial currently\nhas nearly \u00a39 million of\ntheir endowment fund\ninvested in the fossil fuel\nindustry, as well as several\nmillions invested in arms\ncompanies.\nWhile Imperial has a\nnumber of departments\ndedicated to climate\nchange and sustainability,\nsuch as the Grantham\nInstitute for Climate\nChange, they scored\nextremely poorly in a\nrange of areas, including\neducation for sustainable\ndevelopment. One academic told Felix that the\nresults showed that it was\n\u201cabout time the College\ntakes sustainability as\nseriously as the other 140\nuniversities ahead of us.\u201d\nUnion and College\nunder fire for handling of sexual assault case\nAn alumna of Imperial\ntold Felix that the Union\nand College\u2019s handling\nof her sexual assault was\n\u201cmore distressing\u201d than\nthe incident itself.\nThe alumna told Felix\nthat she was attending\nan event at the Union\nearlier this year when she\nUnion or College at the\ntime, only doing so two\nmonths later, when the\naccused perpetrator was\nrunning to be president\nof a student society. She\nwas passed between the\nCollege and the Union in\nan investigation that took\nseven months, and left her\nsuicidal at points.\nAs well as frequent\nperiods with no commu-nication, there was no\ncentral point of contact\nprovided by the College,\nleaving the alumna feeling\nisolated. There were\nproblems with collecting\nwitness statements: none\nof the witnesses were able\nto provide a statement\nwithout some form of\nmiscommunication, the\naccused did not have his\nstatement collected until\nOctober, and at some\npoints the alumna was\nencouraged to contact\nwitnesses herself.\nWhen the investigation came to a close, the\nUnion concluded that the\naccused was guilty of\nsexual misconduct, but\nthat the accused\u2019s position\nof authority was not \u201can\nenabling factor\u201d, since he\nwas not in the position at\nthe time of the incident.\nThe victim described this\noutcome as \u201ca mere slap\non the wrist\u201d, as well as\n\u201cirrelevant and offensive\u201d.\nThe victim told Felix that\n\u201cunless the Union can\ndemonstrate they are able\nto handle sexual abuse\ncases efficiently, fairly,\nand supportively, it is clear\nto me they should not take\non this responsibility.\u201d\nThe College and Union\nhave both said that they\nwill learn lessons from\nthe case, and review their\npolicy for future com-plaints. It is highly likely\nthat this will not be the last\ncomplaint Imperial needs\nto investigate: research\nin 2010 found that one in\nseven female students in\nthe UK had been a victim\nof sexual violence.\n\u201cWoodward\nwas declared\n'safe' despite\nits cladding\nfailing the fire\nsafety tests\u201d\nemail, which assured them\nthat \u2013 despite failing the\ntests \u2013 the building was\n\u201csafe for occupancy\u201d. The\nCollege have been consulting with professionals\nregarding removal of the\ncladding, and are awaiting\nresults of tests carried out\nby the Building Research\nEstablishment (BRE). A\nCollege spokesperson told\nFelix they expect results\nearly in the new year.\nResidents of the hall\nalso revealed to Felix that\n\u201cThe victim\nsaid that the\ninvestigation\nby the Union\nand College\nand Union\nwas more\ndistressing\nthan the\nassault \u201d\nwas sexually assaulted\nby a current student. She\ndid not report it to the\nstaff had been breaching\nfire safety protocol by\nwedging open doors\nacross a single floor.\nOne student said that the\napproach the College had\ntaken was \u201cinsulting to\nour intelligence, with nine\nparagraphs of shallow\nreassurance, and only one\nImperial did terribly in the People & Planet League Tables // Tom Mrazek\n\n"

However, the\njourney was rather long\nso after an adventurous\ntrip via the London under-ground, overground and\nbus services, ICXCAC\nfinally reached North\nLondon\u2019s Lee Valley Athletics Centre around noon.\nAs they got there, the\nImperial crew settled\ndown in a crowd of 276\nathletes from 24 clubs,\n55 of which were from\nImperial! They then had\ntime to get changed,\nget their bibs and start\nwarming up as the first\nevents were scheduled to\nbegin at 13:00, and there\nwas no way Imperial were\nmissing any events: they\nhad the highest participation with a massive 187\nindividual events entered!\nAs the day began,\nathletes made their way to\nthe pole vault, high jump\nand 60m hurdles starting\nline, ready to make the\nmost out of their day.\nThe first events proved\nto everyone that Imperial\nwasn\u2019t there to spectate:\nNo\u00ebl Rimensberger took\n3rd\nin the Men\u2019s 60m\nHurdle in 9.44s and then\n3rd\nagain for the Men\u2019s\nHigh Jump with an impressive 1m80, followed\nclosely in 4th\nby Baptiste\nThebert.\nThe Women\u2019s team\ndid an equally inspiring\nperformance as sisters\nViktoria and Katherina\n\u201cImperial\ntook 1st\n, 2nd\n,\nand 3rd\nfor\nthe Pole Vault\ncompetition,\nundoubtedly\nleaving the\nwhole stadium\nstunned\u201d\ntheir great performance\nearlier, No\u00ebl and Baptiste\nwent on to dominate the\nlong and triple jump,\ngrabbing respectively 2nd\nand 3rd\nthen 1st\nand 3rd\nfor these events. Marta\nVon Ginkel also managed\nto reach an impressive\n9.67m for her triple jump,\nreaching a well-deserved\n3rd\nplace.\nAfter a short break\nin events, what were\nsurely the most inspiring\nand intense events were\ncoming up: the track\nevents finals. The evening\nevents started slightly\nbefore 6pm with the\n1500m final, where Kate\nOlding smashed it and\ntook gold in just over 5\nminutes for the Women\u2019s\nrace, and on the Men\u2019s\nteam fresher James Millet\ndid a great performance\ncoming in 3rd\noverall\nwith 4:19.36, followed\nclosely by trail Captain\nHenry Hart and Men\u2019s\nCaptain Lewis Jackson,\nall placing in the top 10.\nFurther down the line,\nAlex Mundell reached\nfor another medal as she\ntook 3rd\nin the Women\u2019s\n400m final.

The\ncourse encourages us to\nbe creative, and it\u2019s just\nso new, so I thought I\u2019d\nhave a go at something,\nand find other people who\nare being creative, and put\nthem all in one nice place.\nF: Was there a lightbulb moment for you\nin terms of your interaction with the arts?\nWhere you switched\non to it, and you\nthought \u2018I do really\nenjoy arty things, as\nwell as science\u2019?\nJ: In my final year of my\nundergrad I went out to\nPanama, and I was doing\nmy undergrad research\nproject in the jungle,\nwhich was great. I took a\nsketchbook with me, just\nbecause I thought there\nwas nobody here to judge\nhow rubbish I\u2019ve become\nafter three years of not\ndrawing. It was really\nsimple, just pen and ink,\nalmost like biro pen, but\nit was just nice. And then\nI submitted it as part of\nmy report, and they loved\nit. It that was really nice\nfeedback. It was wholesome and good.\nF: When you were in\nyour undergrad did\nyou take part in artistic societies or do\nartistic things, or was\nthere never really\nenough time?\nJ: No, I did volunteering\nfor a listening charity,\ncalled Oxford Nightline.\nI volunteered for them\nfor two years which took\nup a lot of time. I also did\nso many extracurricular\nthings; I organised a ball,\nI was housing officer, I\njust did too many things.\nBut none of them were\ncreative in any way. I\ndistanced myself from\nthat and it didn\u2019t feel\nright. But drawing takes\nso much practice. Even\ntoday, the only drawings\nI show people are maybe\none out of 50 that have\nmaybe gone right.\nF: I know when Indira spoke to Liliane,\nshe\u2019s quite passionate about how she\napproaches her scientific practice as\nan art form. Is that\nsomething you do as\nwell, or do you keep\nthem quite separate\nin a way?\nJ: I feel science educa-tion, even at school, they\nremove it completely\n[from the arts]. Science\nis treated as this discrete,\nindividual thing, and\nthere\u2019s a \u2018set\u2019 way to do\nscience. Obviously that\nties into the way the publication structure works:\nyou\u2019re not going to be\nable to publish a paper\nthat doesn\u2019t have a methodology section, or has a\nnice painting. So, I feel a\nlot of people see science\nas this immovable, rigid\nstructure; that\u2019s what my\nexperience was.\nF: And moving back\nto Phoenix, we\u2019ve got\na very exciting mini\ntaster in Felix this\nweek, and then next\nterm we\u2019re going on\nto the full magazine.\nBut for this taster,\nwhat can we expect\nfrom it? What are you\nexcited about?\nJ: We\u2019ve got a nice\ninterview with Agnes,\nwho took the winning\nphotograph of the Queens\nTower. She talks about\nher photograph, and what\nshe\u2019s done in the past,\nbecause she\u2019s had a bit of\na research career, so that\u2019s\nreally exciting.\nWhether you have a completed piece, something\nin mind, or just want to\nget involved, the Phoenix\nEditors want to hear from\nyou: phoenix@ic.ac.uk.\nOur wonderful new Phoenix Editors\na music scene. But that\u2019s\ntalking about the late 90s,\nso there\u2019s a whole different scene of how students\nare as well. Then I went\nto Cambridge, which was\nanother kettle of fish. I\ndid my PGCE there, and\nthat\u2019s so upper class \u2013\neveryone from private\nschools, I wouldn\u2019t have\nfelt comfortable doing\nthis [editing Phoenix]\nthere. I would have felt\nthat loads of people would\nhave said \u2018who the fuck\ndo you think you are?\u2019\nA: How then did you\nget involved with\nPhoenix?\nC: An email came around\nfrom Fred, and I saw H.G.\nWells mentioned, and I\nwas like \u2018yeah, might as\nwell apply for this\u2019. I say\nI\u2019ve got more confidence\nabout trying stuff out\nnow I\u2019m older, I probably\nwouldn\u2019t have tried it if I\nweren\u2019t a mature student.\nA: That\u2019s interesting.\nI think a lot of people\nwho come to Imperial\nand study science or\nengineering have an\ninterest in art, but are\ntoo intimidated to\nget involved with it.\nC: Yeah, they should get\ninvolved with it! Go for\nit, like why not? If it goes\nwrong, nothing is going to\nhappen, nobody\u2019s expecting anything, just chuck it\nout there, see if it comes\nback. What I really want\nto see [in Phoenix] is a\nwider participation \u2013 see\npeople who don\u2019t think\nof themselves as being\narty sending stuff in and\ngetting it published.\nJOY AND FRED\nFred: I thought we\ncould kick off with\nyou telling me a bit\nabout you \u2018journey\u2019 \u2013\nhow did we get to this\npoint?\nJoy: So I studied biology\nfor my undergrad, and\nthen after than I took a\nyear out. I worked, I did\nsome volunteering with\nan environmental charity,\nand I worked in a cafe,\nand I went cycling for\nthree months. Then I\ncame to Imperial; I\u2019m a\npart time student, so I\u2019ve\nbeen here a year now, this\nis my second year doing\nScience Communication.\nF: What made you\ndecide to apply for\nPhoenix Editor?\nJ: I\u2019ve always been\ncreative \u2013 my great aunt\ntaught me to paint when\nI was really little \u2013 but\nas soon as I did a science\nJOY\nCATH\nE\nR\nI\nN\nE\nClash of Cultures: Phoenix Editors special\nPhoenix, Felix\u2019s sister arts publication, returns this\nweek with a teaser 8-page pullout. Arts Editors Indira\nMalik and Adam Gellatly and Felix Editor-in-Chief Fred\nFyles talk to Phoenix Editors Liliane Laborde-Edozien,\nCatherine Webb, and Joy Aston about their plans for\nthe magazine and their love of science and art.\nARTS\nLILIANE AND INDIRA\nIndira: Can you tell\nus a bit about what\nPhoenix is?\nLilliane: Phoenix was\noriginally started by H.G.\nWells and was at some\npoint discontinued, and\nthen brought back, not\ntoo long ago, to be the\narts magazine, and pay\nhomage to its history and\nfounder.\nI: And what inspired\nyou to get involved\nwith the editorial\nteam and work with\nPhoenix?\nL: Despite coming from\nscientific training, I\u2019ve\nalways identified myself\nas an artist. That\u2019s a\nmassive part of my\nidentity \u2013 this weird sci-entist-artist hybrid. I knew\nI wanted to be involved\nwith the arts, and maintain\nthat part of my identity. I\nsaw this opportunity, and\nI just felt like I had to give\nit a shot. And here I am.\nI: This week, we have\nan eight-page pull-out, a kind of \u2018Mini-Phoenix\u2019 for this\nterm. Could you tell\nus a bit more about\nwhat\u2019s going to be in\nit, and what we can\nlook forward to?\nL: This week, it\u2019s a\nsmaller, more condensed\nversion, because it\u2019s a\nkind of a taster.\nWe\u2019ve kind of established what you\u2019ll\nnormally find in it. You\u2019ll\nalways have a spotlight\non an artist, where we\nwill highlight a specific\nartist who\u2019s a student\nat Imperial, and it will\ninclude an interview, a\nchat, and a huge display\nof their work. There will\nalso be a feature article,\nwhere we will touch upon\nsomething relevant to the\narts field and to what\u2019s\ngoing on in today\u2019s world.\nThen there\u2019s a gallery\nportion, where we have a\ncuration of several artists\nand several pieces \u2013 that\ncan include anything that\nwe can tap a 2D version\nof. It can be flash fiction,\npoetry, photography, photographs of sculptures, or\npaintings.\nI: What\u2019s going to be\nthe feature article\nthis week?\nL: This week we are\nexploring what we as\na society are willing to\nforgive for the sake of\nart and for the sake of\ngenius. We\u2019re exploring\nartists who are successful,\nand renowned for their\nwork, but have a darker\nhistory that we don\u2019t pay\nany attention to. We look\nat whether there will be\na future where we don\u2019t\ntolerate monstrosity for\nthe sake of someone\u2019s\nbeautiful painting or\nbeautiful film; and I find,\nthat we\u2019re generally more\nwilling to forgive a man\nfor the sake of art.\nI: Do you think the\nrules are different for\nwomen artists?\nL: A good example is\nJean-Paul Sartre and\nSimone de Beauvoir,\na couple engaged in a\npolyamorous relationship,\nwho were both philosophical writers. De Beauvoir\nwas under much more\nscrutiny for her polyam-orous lifestyle than Sartre.\nSartre was quite notorious for not necessarily\ntreating de Beauvoir very\nwell, but we forget that\nbecause he has Huis clos,\nand several other pieces of\nliterature that we love. De\nBeauvoir was under a lot\nof scrutiny at the time for\nher lifestyle, even though\nthey were engaging in the\nsame lifestyle. So I think\nthere is a bit of a double\nstandard there.\nstudent on the Science\nCommunication course.\nI did a Biology degree\nat Manchester, and then\nI had a couple of jobs: a\nresearch job, I worked\nin a blood bank. Then I\ndid a PGCE, and I was a\nteacher for quite a while,\nin primary schools, eight\nyears in total. Then I was\na sort-of unwilling housewife and stay-at-home\nmum in California for a\nfew years. I couldn\u2019t have\na job in California because\nI didn\u2019t have a visa. So I\ndid that for a few years,\nand then I came back,\nwent back into teaching.\nI really like teaching,\nI like kids, I like the\ncreative aspects. But\nwhen I got back from\nCalifornia, the system had\nchanged to a point where\nI felt that to do a good job\nas seen by the government\nI would almost be torturing children into making\nthem learn things that are\nuseless and irrelevant \u2013\nand research backs me up\non that.\nI was on my way to\nwork one day, in the\ndark at 6am, waiting for\nthe tube, and I was like\n\u2018ugh, why did I become a\nteacher?\u2019, and I thought \u2018I\nthink I became a teacher\nbecause I couldn\u2019t afford\nto do any postgraduate\nstudy\u2019 but I could afford\nto do that now.\nThe other reason why\nI became a teacher\nwas because I\u2019m really\npassionate about people\nhaving a better understanding of science and\nscientific process, and\nmore critical thinking\nskills to evaluate what\nthey see in the media. So,\nI thought I would hand in\nmy notice and I did hand\nmy notice in that day, then\nI thought \u2018shit, I haven\u2019t\ngot a job now\u2019. I noticed\nthere was this course at\nImperial that was really\ninteresting, so I thought\nI\u2019d give it a go.\nA: What are your interests in the arts? Is\nit something you\u2019ve\nbeen interested in,\nis it a more recent\nthing?\nC: I\u2019ve always been\ninterested in writing,\nI\u2019ve always written.\nI\u2019ve written lots of short\nstories and a couple of\nbooks for children. I like\ngoing to see art, but I like\nit because I don\u2019t really\nunderstand it. In terms of\nvisual arts, I don\u2019t have\na lot of background in\nthat kind of thing, but I\nthink the driving force of\nscience and the driving\nforce of arts are the same\nthing: curiosity. Trying to\nfind out about the world,\nand then trying to represent that, whether you\u2019re\ndoing that through scientific method, or through\ndrawing, or writing, or\nphotography. It\u2019s a lot of\nthe same skills, so to be a\ngood artist you need to be\na good observer, and to be\na good scientist you need\nto be a good observer. I\nfeel like they\u2019re all in the\nsame... I think it\u2019s an artificial distinction between\nscience and arts.\nA: Do you notice any\nsimilarities or differences in terms of\nhow art is perceived\nin Manchester, compared to here at Imperial?\nC: I\u2019d say there was a\nlivelier scene of what I\u2019d\nbe more involved in, like\ndid you face any challenges in putting together what you have\nso far, or do you envisage any challenges\ngoing forward in getting enough material\nfor an arts magazine?\nL: I think initially,\nespecially if you\u2019re not\nthinking creatively, there\nare a lot of challenges\non the surface. As you\nsaid we\u2019re in a science\nuniversity, who has time\nfor art? But I find for a\nlot of people, that\u2019s not a\nunique experience, a lot of\npeople feel tugged in two\ndirections.\nI always saw the\nscientist as an artist and\nthe artist as a scientist.\nI would hang out with\ndancers and actors, and\nnobody had any idea that I\nwas a science major, they\nthought \u2018oh, you\u2019re not\nstudying philosophy?\u201d\nBut when I was with them,\nand I saw how passionate\nand diligent they were\nwith their craft. I thought\nthere were so many parallels with science, and\nhow you would approach\nscience. And it was the\nsame with scientists;\nwatching them, I saw\nthem creating art. I fell\nin love with science for\nromantic reasons \u2013 for me\nscience is just discovered\nmagic. So, for me, the\nparallels are not much of\na stretch.\nImperial students aren\u2019t\nincapable of creating art,\nthe art is juts a little dif-ferent. Like growing fungi\non a petri dish and taking\npictures of it \u2013 that\u2019s art.\nThe art of nature, of life,\nand of the research.\nCATHERINE AND\nADAM\nAdam: Can you tell us\na bit about yourself,\nwhat you do at Imperial and your role in\nPhoenix?\nCatherine: I\u2019m a Masters\n\u201cI was on my\nway to work\none day...\nand I was like\n\u2018ugh, why did\nI become a\nteacher?\u2019\u201d\nI: Coming to somewhere like Imperial,\nwhere we\u2019re primarily\na science university,\n\u201cI fell in love\nwith science\nfor romantic\nreasons \u2013 for\nme science is\njust discovered\nmagic\u201d\n\n"

The National\nare a well-known New\nYork-based post-rock\nband (up Interpol\u2019s alley),\nknown best for their\ntwo magnificent albums\nCrocodile and Boxer. So\nthe story goes, a group of\nfriends from Ohio moved\nto New York for careers\nin advertising, said \u201cfuck\nthis\u201d after a decade or\nso, and so the band was\nborn. The ballads are mid-dle-class and melancholy,\nelegant and suave yet con-fessional, and presented\nwith sincerity. This album\npairs nicely with good\nwine.\n6\nDrunk\nThundercat\nKnown for his collaborations with Flying Lotus\nand Kamasi Washington,\nand his stint as bassist\nof Suicidal Tendencies,\nThundercat attained recognition after featuring on\nKendrick Lamar\u2019s seminal\nTo Pimp a Butterfly.\nWith a delightful sense\nof humor and a mind-melt-ing sense of funk, Drunk is\nthe breakthrough album to\nend breakthrough albums.\nFor those who might\nneed extra convincing,\nevidence of his virtuosity\nis readily apparent in\na fantastic Tiny Desk\nConcert for NPR. All\naboard the Thundercat\nhype train, my dudes.\n5\nMr. Finish Line\nVulfpeck\nIt seems Vulfpeck,\nthe apparent musician\u2019s\nmusicians, can do no\nwrong. This latest effort\nis a festival of funk,\nfeaturing one of the\nbest bassists working\ntoday and a collection\nof multi-instrumentalist\nvirtuosos. The group\nmet at the University of\nMichigan\u2019s music school,\nand has been steadily\nbuilding steam since their\n2011 debut. Always tight,\nalways going somewhere\nwonky, and always clearly\ndelighting in the music\nthey\u2019re making, Vulfpeck\nput up a strong showing\nwith Mr. Finish Line.\nWonderful sounds and\nrhythms abound - give it\na spin.\n4\nElektrak\nShobaleader One\nReaders may know\nSquarepusher for a drum\nand bass career that spans\nback to the mid-90s. The\nLondon-based electronic\nartist is not limited to\nelectronica, however.\nThis album features what\nfeels very much like a jazz\nfusion quartet playing his\ncompositions. And man\ndo they nail it. Cop E8\nBoogie - one of the most\nsatisfying bass licks (per-formed by Squarepusher\nhimself) I\u2019ve ever had the\npleasure of listening to.\nThis album (recorded live\nin concert), to pardon the\npun, hits every note for\nme.\n3\nA Crow Looked At Me\nMount Eerie\nThis album is a wonder-ful, but incredibly painful\nlisten. Singer-songwriter\nPhil Elverum is fresh off\nthe tragic death of his wife\nGenevi\u00e8ve, who passed\nearlier this year. This\nalbum is essentially Elverum\u2019s nauseatingly present\noutburst of emotion about\nthe topic. The compositions are skeletal and\nmostly acoustic; the lyrics\nare packed with pathos,\nfrom blunt references to\nthe time past since her\ndeath to \u201cI brought a chair\nfrom home / I\u2019m leaving\nit on the hill / Facing west\nand north / And I poured\nout your ashes on it / I\nguess so you can watch\nthe sunset / But the truth is\nI don\u2019t think of the dust as\nyou / You are the sunset.\u201d\nEvery song on this album\nis brutally sad, deeply\nmoving, and otherwise\nintense and engaging.\nAnd yet, a better audible\nmemorial to Genevi\u00e8ve is\ninconceivable.\n2\nRelatives in Descent\nProtomartyr\nProtomartyr deliver\nsolid, progressive Rust\nBelt post-punk, with an\nartistic streak all of their\nown. Ambling, janky\nguitar lines are tracked\nover plodding drums and\na dragging bassline, while\nsinger Joe Casey lays\ndown pure poetry with\na deep, exhausted, wonderfully enticing voice.\nTheir latest effort is an\nexcitingly experimental\nstep into a unique sound.\nSeething and desolate\nwhen downtempo, and\nfully punk rock when up,\nthe hot streak that started\nwith Agent Intellect continues onto Relatives in\nDescent. Fuck Paramore,\nthis is what punk in 2017\nsounds like.\nDomino\n1\nCrack-Up\nFleet Foxes\nFleet Foxes are a folk\nband from the state of\nWashington with a knack\nfor rootsy, reverberating\ncompositions. Their\nsophomore effort, 2011\u2019s\nHelplessness Blues, was\nan instant classic; then\nthey immediately went on\nhiatus. Their comeback,\nCrack-Up, delivers in\nspades. The lush vocal\nharmonies are now accompanied by experimental song structure, dense\nlyricism, and a vibrant instrumental palette - from\nflitting pianos, to off-kil-ter woodwind sections,\nto soaring violins, which\ncome together phenomenally in perfectly-crafted\norchestrations.This is a\nglimmering masterpiece\nthat shouldn\u2019t be missed.\n4AD\n\u201cAlways tight,\nalways going\nsomewhere\nwonky, and\nalways clearly\ndelighting\nin the music\nthey\u2019re\nmaking.\u201d\n\u201cEvery song\non this album\nis brutally\nsad, deeply\nmoving, and\notherwise\nintense and\nengaging.\u201d\n\u201cAmbling,\njanky guitar\nlines are\ntracked over\nplodding\ndrums and\na dragging\nbassline.\u201d\nBrainfeeder Vulf Records\nWarp Records\nP.W.

It had a clear\nand bold start, compelling\nsecond act, and now,\nhopefully, a memorable\nending. But seriously,\nlet\u2019s talk about who will\nend up winning the big\nprizes next spring. There\nare always strong indicators from the second a\nfilm finishes its first press\nscreening of its chances.\nIt is a long road from\nthere on, with numerous\ntwists and bumps. Since\nthis article was written, a\nnumber of critics\u2019 groups\nand smaller awards ceremonies have taken place\nthat have cemented the\nposition of some films,\nwhile seeing others have\ntheir chances diminished.\nJust this Wednesday, Get\nwith unexpected awards\nsuccess, and it may well\nnot be one of the front\nrunners. More bizarrely,\nmaster surrealist David\nLynch\u2019s magnificent Twin\nPeaks: The Return, aired\non Showtime over eighteen episodes, was named\nthe second best film of the\nyear. While Lynch himself\nconsiders his work a very\nlong film, it is the continuation of a television\nshow, aired on television,\nin an episodic format.\nThis once again highlights\nthe blurring between film\nand television that was\ndemonstrated by O.J.:\nMade in America winning\nbest documentary at the\nAcademy Awards last\nyear. It must be noted that\ntwo of the films that I will\ndiscuss here, The Post and\nPhantom Thread, were\nnot featured in the Sight\nand Sound poll as they\nhave yet to screen outside\nof the States.\nFront Runners\nIt is increasingly\nbecomingatrendforOscar\ncontenders to emerge\nfrom Sundance. Last year\nit was Manchester by the\nSea (after The Birth of\na Nation was tanked by\ndetails of Nate Parker\u2019s\n1999 rape trial emerging).\nThis year Call Me by\nYour Name arrived like\na juggernaut. Luca Guadagnino has shown talent\nthroughout his career,\nbut he finally brings it all\ntogether for this elegant\ncoming-of-age drama, set\nin 1983 Italy, chronicling\nthe romantic relationship\nbetween a 17 year old boy\nand his father\u2019s American\nstudent. Adapted from\nAndr\u00e9 Aciman\u2019s novel\nby Oscar stalwart James\nIvory, Call Me by Your\nName has continued its\nmomentum from the start\nof the year, playing well\nthrough the fall festivals,\nand will go wide in the\nStates at the end of the\nmonth. It is sure to get\nnods from the Academy\nshould get a best cinematography nomination.\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet is\na rising star (he also\nappears in Lady Bird and\nHostiles this winter), and\nshould become one of the\nyoungest ever nominees\nfor best actor. Michael\nStuhlbarg could finally\nearn an Oscar nomination\nfor Best Supporting Actor\nfor his best performance\nsince A Serious Man\n(one scene in particular\nin the third act should\nhave voters sold). Armie\nHammer has never\nreally given much of an\nindication that he could\nact particularly well,\nbut he acquits himself\nsolidly here. It may not be\nenough for a nomination,\nespecially if Academy\nvoters are unsure whether\nto place him as a lead\nor supporting actor, but\nhe can be proud of his\ncareer-best work.\nWhen considering the\nbest British filmmakers\nof the modern day, many\nwill answer \u2018Christopher\nand cinematic quality to\nbig budget science fiction\nfilms. His Dark Knight\ntrilogy was for the most\npart a vast improvement\non previous efforts from\nTim Burton and Joel\nSchumacher (though\nundeniably Darren Aronofsky\u2019s planned Taxi\nDriver-style neo-noir\nwith Joaquin Phoenix as\nthe caped crusader would\nhave been the greatest\npossible on-screen\ndepiction of Batman).\nNolan\u2019s long-awaited war\npiece, Dunkirk, opened\nto rapturous acclaim in\nthe summer, and proved\npopular with audiences\ntoo, raking in over $500\nmillion at the box office.\nIn the past Nolan has been\ncriticised for his over long\nrun times, paper thin characters and cringe-worthy\ndialogue. For the most part\nhe does away with these\nfaults, instead playing\n\u201cGet Out has\ncontinued its\nmomentum by\nbeing named\nthe best film\nof the year in\nthe prestigious\nSight and\nSound poll\u201d\nOut continued its momentum by being named\nthe best film of the year\nin the prestigious Sight\nand Sound poll. Jordan\nPeele\u2019s genre-bender is\nfollowing its unexpected\ncommercial success\n\u201cCall Me by\nYour Name has\ncontinued its\nmomentum\nfrom the start\nof the year,\nplaying well\nthrough the\nfall festivals\u201d\nfor Best Picture, Best\nDirector and BestAdapted\nScreenplay. Sayombhu\nMukdeeprom gorgeously captures intimate\nmoments on 35mm, and\n\u201cChristopher\nNolan must\nbe respected\nfor the way he\nhas brought\nintelligence\nand cinematic\nquality to big\nbudget films\u201d\nNolan\u2019 without hesita-tion. While the likes of\nLynne Ramsay and Steve\nMcQueen are stronger\ndirectors, Nolan must be\nrespected for the way he\nhas brought intelligence\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet is fast becoming a top pick for Best Actor // Sony Picture Classics\nto his strengths of visual\nstyle and roaring sound.\nExpect Dunkirk to score\nhighly in the technical\ncategories, alongside the\nobvious Best Picture and\nBest Director nods. With\nthis being a true ensemble\npiece, it is unlikely to\nscore any acting nominations in spite of the strong\nperformances all round,\nwith Mark Rylance the\nmost likely for Best Supporting Actor, a category\nhe won two years ago for\nBridge of Spies. Warner\ndecided to release this\nsuspense thriller in July,\naiming to avoid any notion\nof it being Oscar bait, and\nalso peculiarly wanting to\nemulate Saving Private\nRyan, a similarly visceral\nwar film that of course\nundeservingly lost to\nShakespeare in Love for\nBest Picture in 1998. They\nwill have fingers crossed\nthat Dunkirk fares better\nand goes all the way to the\nDolby Theatre podium.\nSpielberg. Hanks.\nStreep. The last film to\nrelease a trailer this year\nwas The Post. Since then\nmany seem to have placed\nthis historical drama at the\nhead of the pack of contenders for best picture.\nTen or twenty years ago\nthis would have been the\nshrewd move. However,\nthis is 2017, and the\nAcademy will no longer\nbow down to big names\nand dry biopics. Granted,\nSpielberg\u2019s recent period\ndramas Lincoln and\nBridge of Spies have been\nagainst the fiery performances that McDormand\nand Ronan have given?\nThis is a timely film given\nthat it concerns the role of\nThe Washington Post and\nThe New York Times in\nthe leak of the Pentagon\nPapers that detailed the\nrole of the United States\nGovernment during\nthe Vietnam War. The\nparallels with the Trump\nregime are obvious. If\nit is as good as Spotlight\nor All the President\u2019s\nMen then it has a chance\n(co-writer Josh Singer\nalso co-wrote Spotlight\nincidentally). It features\na strong supporting cast,\nincluding TV stars Sarah\nPaulson, Carrie Coon,\nMatthew Rhys, and Bob\nOdenkirk. There were\nallegedly issues in the\nediting room, but any fear\nthat The Post\u2019s chances\nof Oscar glory could\nbe derailed have been\nallayed by strong early\nreviews and the National\nBoard of Review naming\nit the best film of the\nyear on Tuesday, as well\nas awarding Streep and\nHanks Best Actress and\nBest Actor respectively.\nWhile the Oscars are\noverwhelmingly biased\ntowards English-language\ncinema, the Academy has\nat times failed to properly\nreward the greats of\nAmerican cinema. Sure\nthe likes of Ford, Wilder\nand Capra won multiples\ntimes, but Kubrick,\nLynch and Altman never\nwon Best Director. Even\nScorsese has only one win\nfrom eight nominations,\nlong overdue when he\ntook home his award for\nThe Departed, a film far\nfrom his best work. Paul\nThomas Anderson is just\nthe latest in a long line\nof mercurial talents to\nbe undervalued by the\nAcademy. From six nominations he is yet to win\na single time. His latest\nfilm, Phantom Thread,\nsees him reunite with\nSir Daniel Day-Lewis\nfor the latter\u2019s final ever\nperformance. The last\ntime the two collaborated\nAnderson came so close\nto sweeping the Academy\nAwards with There Will\nBe Blood, only to lose\nin his categories to No\nCountry for Old Men. Men\nis a great film, and one of\nthe best of the century,\nbut Blood is one of the\ngreatest films ever made.\n\u201cWhile The\nPost boasts\nStreep and\nHanks, this is\n2017, and the\nAcademy will\nno longer bow\ndown to big\nnames\u201d\nvery good, but neither took\nhome Best Picture. We\nare a quarter of a century\nfrom the days when\nHanks dominated the\nBest Actor category, and\nwhile Streep will get her\ncustomary nomination,\ncan she really compete\nDay-Lewis of course won\nfor Best Actor in that\nfilm, and has since gone\non to become the most\nsuccessful actor in Oscar\nhistory. The Academy\nrevelled in handing him\nhis record third victory\nfor Lincoln (especially\nafter front runner Joaquin\nPhoenix badmouthed\nthe whole notion of\nthem do so again. Jonny\nGreenwood reinvented\nfilm scoring in Blood, and\nwhile he is up against stiff\ncompetition from the likes\nof Hans Zimmer, even the\nlikable German admits\nthat it is Greenwood\nwho is the finest film\ncomposer on the planet\nat the minute. Phantom\nThread will be a strong\ncontender in a number of\ntechnical categories, including Costume Design,\nMakeup and Hairstyling,\nand Production Design.\nAnderson himself will not\njust be gunning for the\ntriple crown previously\nbestowed on the likes of\nWilder, Brooks, the Coens\nand Coppola; he will be\ngoing for a quadruple,\nas he also serves as the\ncinematographer on his\nnewest film (a fact he is\nkeen to play down). He\nhas recently proved a little\ntoo esoteric for Academy\nvoters, in the way that\nKubrick was ahead of his\ntime, and only gained full\nappreciation years later.\nAnderson will be hoping\nthat his time is now.\n\u201cPaul Thomas\nAnderson will\nbe gunning\nfor the triple\ncrown of Best\nFilm, Best\nDirector, and\nBest Original\nScreenplay\nfor Phantom\nThread\u201d\nawards season, calling it\n\u201ccomplete bullshit\u201d and\n\u201cthe worst carrot I have\never tasted\u201d), and it would\nnot be surprising to see\nMeryl Streep is likely to get an obligatory nod for The Post // Fox\nDunkirk will probably get a number of technical awards // Warner Bros\n\n"

CCTV\nfootage showed the theft\noccurred at 10.30am,\nand both suspects were\nwearing balaclavas.\nThe bike, which was a\nBrompton model, was\nworth around \u00a31,000.

If you\nweren\u2019t already familiar\nwith the events of this\nyear, then you\u2019ll be delighted to know that the\nwriters have come up\nwith a whole bunch of\nwonderfully smug retrospectives to remind you\nof what happened, or to\ntrigger the next batch of\nPTSD and electrotherapy.\nPeople like to wrap up a\nyear, almost as if to put it\nsafely away, as an end to\na narrative. In case you\nwere wondering the decisions and events that you\nand I have lived through\nthis year will continue to\nhaunt us forever.\n2017 has been a year of\nhighs and lows, but where\nthe highs are deep below\nsea level and the lows\nlurk somewhere around\nSatan\u2019s anus. Beginning\nwith the inauguration of\nan orange billboard for\nwhite supremacy as the\nleader of the free world is\nnot a particularly auspicious start to the year, and\na considerable amount\nof misery and depravity\nhave sprung from this\nsingle well. Whether it\u2019s\nproclaiming that there\nare good people on both\nsides at a neo-Nazi vs not\nneo-Nazi rally, or finally\nshooting the Israeli-Palestinian peace process\nin the head, the Donald\nsomehow always finds a\nway to make the world a\nslightly worse place. All\nI can say is, thank you El\nPresidente, for giving me\nso much more to loathe.\nIt would be remiss of\nme to keep my focus on\nonly one key player in\ndistance of a functioning\nnuclear deterrent. Naturally, I look forward to\nbeing erased in a haze of\natomic fire, but I\u2019d prefer\nto be incinerated in the\nmidst of a catastrophic\nshowdown between the\nworld\u2019s superpowers and\nnot by a chubby bloke that\nassassinated his brother\nwith nerve gas and shot\nhis uncle with an anti-air-craft gun.\nThird and fourth on\nthis list must of course go\nto Putin and Xi Jingping,\nmostly because I\u2019d be at\nrisk of being assassinated\nif they weren\u2019t on here.\nYou don\u2019t have to be a\ngay-hating expansionist\ndictator, or just a ruthless\nTibetan-hating dictator\nto make this list but it\ndefinitely helps. Special\nthanks goes to Putin for\nstabilising the Assad\nregime and obstructing\nthe UN investigation into\nuse of chemical weapons.\nFinal place of this filler\narticle must of course go\nto the UK government.\nhave handled everything\nthrown at them like a\nblind, quadruple-amputee\ntrying to play catch. I\nhate fucking incompe-tents. I am greatly looking\nforward to next year when\nall of my favourite characters reappear, and I get to\nhate them for all kinds of\nnew reasons.\nFinally, as some sort\nof catharsis to finishing\nthe last piece of the year,\nI extend my antipathy to\nyou, my peers. I can\u2019t put\nmy finger on exactly why\nI hate you so, possibly\nyour pathetic attachment\nto Stella or your frankly\ndisturbing lack of opinions\non anything important. I\nhope you all have exams\nafter Christmas so you\ncan\u2019t enjoy it and that all\nyour New Year\u2019s goals are\nunfulfilled. Have a shit\n2018.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t\nhave to be a\ndictator to\nmake this list,\nbut it helps\u201d\nthis year\u2019s crock of shit.\nSecond place of course\nmust go to everyone\u2019s\nfavourite fat Korean, Kim\nJong-Un. While he is a\nmust on all lists of this\nnature thanks to his large\ngirth and his people\u2019s\nconstant emaciation due\nto famine, Kim\u2019s major\nachievement this year\nhas been to place North\nKorea within touching\n\u201cFinally, I\nextend my\nantipathy to\nyou, my peers.\nI can\u2019t put\nmy finger on\nexactly why I\nhate you\u201d\nI enjoy nothing more\nthan to witness their\nserial incompetency\nwith regards Brexit, the\nelection or handling\nanything remotely sen-sitive.

The celebration of\nChristmas day has, in\nJapan, become inextricably linked with eating\nfried chicken with long\nqueues throughout the\nday for some finger licking goodness. The story\nbegins in the 70\u2019s with\nan intrepid businessman,\nwho later became the\nCEO of KFC Japan,\ncreating the special KFC\nChristmas bucket and\ncorresponding ad cam-paign. From there on\nit\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to\nEight maids-a-\t\t\t milking\nhow it spread, but with\nan estimated 3.6 million\nJapanese families reportedly eating KFC on\nChristmas, it\u2019s certainly\ncemented itself as a\nfestive tradition. While\nwe wait for the next\nanthropological journal\nto cover this bizarre\ntradition I would suggest\nit probably came down\nto clever marketing by\nKFC over the years\nhelped by the Japanese\nability to monetize just\nabout any holiday. Mix\nthis with a lack of availability of turkey and of\ncourse Japan\u2019s bizarre\nlove ofAmerican culture\nand you\u2019ve got yourself\na recipe for a chicken,\nand the legendary 11\nspices, takeover. And\nme? I went for a sushi\ndinner. Christmas is\nabout treating yourself,\nI\u2019ll save the KFC for a\npost exam binge.\nCHRISTMAS ROAST PORK WITH RIB\nGRAVY AND APPLE BREAD SAUCE\nROAST PORK\n1. Place the pork belly in a tray.\n2. Dry the meat as well as you can with a\npaper towel and then rub in salt.\n3. Ideally, you would let it stay in the fridge\novernight, but if you don\u2019t have enough time,\nset it aside for at least one hour.\n4. Roast the pork belly for 30 minutes at\n250\u00b0C, before turning the oven down to\n150\u00b0C and roasting for another 90 minutes\n5. Serve!\nRIB GRAVY\n1. Heat the oil in a saucepan. Add the pork\nribs and fry for 5 minutes or until caramel-ised.\n2. Remove the ribs from the pan and add in\nthe onions and carrots.\n3. Pour over the stock and bring to a boil.\nTry to scrape in all the burnt bits from the\nbottom of the pan.\n4. When the mixture starts boiling, add the\nribs back in. Add the peppercorn, bay leaves\nand thyme. Continue simmering for 1\u00bd hours.\n5. Remove the meat form the ribs and return\nin into the gravy mixture\nAPPLE BREAD SAUCE\nFour calling birds Six geese-a-laying\nYou will need...\n\u2022 400g plain flour\n\u2022 1 tsp bicarbonate of\nsoda\n\u2022 2 tsp ground ginger\n\u2022 1 tsp ground cinnamon\n\u2022 125g butter (unsalt-ed)\n\u2022 200g honey\n\u2022 2 eggs\n1. Mix all the dry ingredients and then add\nin the butter. This step would be really easy\nif you have a food processor, but I imagine\nthat, as a student, you don\u2019t have such fancy kitchen appliances. You can solve this\nproblem by using a hand mixer in the be-ginning, but then you have to start with the\nbutter and then gradually add a bit of flour\nat a time. When your hand mixer cannot do\nthe job anymore, you\u2019ll have to use your\nhands. Or, of course, you can start from the\nbeginning by using your hands. I have faith\nin you, you can do this!\n2. Beat the egg and the honey together until they are homogeneous. Pour them over\nthe dry ingredients, a little at a time. You\nshould try to avoid lumps in your dough.\n3. Knead the dough until smooth and then\nwrap in cling-film.\n4. Leave to chill in the fridge for 30 minutes to an hour.\n5. Roll the dough (after you took it out of\nthe fridge and unwrapped it, but if you really need this advice, you should stay out\nof the kitchen \u2013 just saying!) on a floured\nsurface. Cut out the ginger men \u2013 or wom-en! Maybe you want to let your inner artist\nsurface, and be creative with the cutting.\n6. Bake for 12-20 minutes until gold-en-brown \u2013 to any extent, it shouldn\u2019t take\nlonger than a Two and a Half Men episode.\nIf, meanwhile, your fire alarm starts, you\nshould have taken them out 10 minutes\nago, at least!\n7. When cool enough (of course they cannot be as cool as you are, but they will try\ntheir best), decorate!\n8. Optional step: hide them from your\nhungry flatmates who will finish all your\nfood.\nGINGERBREAD MEN\nCUATRO ALFAJORES\nFive golden rings\nMINCE PIES\nAlan Perfect\nFood Writer\nAndrada Balmez\nFood Editor\nW\nhile you\nm i g h t\nhave heard\nabout the\nmost typical Spanish\nChristmas foods, I want\nto focus on a relatively\nunknown Christmas\nsweet: the alfajor,\nconsumed generally in\nthe south of Spain, and\ndefinitely a high point\nin humanity\u2019s culinary\nachievements.\nAn alfajor is a very\nspecial sweet, made\nmostly out of honey,\nnuts, and spices. How\ncan I explain the experience of having one?\nWhen you try it, the\nfirst thing you notice is\nthe sugar coating. But\nbefore you know it,\ntradition, dating back to\nthe times of Muslim Spain\nin the Middle Ages. And\nyet it has somehow found\nits way into becoming a\nstaple of a predominantly\nChristian celebration.\nyou\u2019ll find yourself deep\ninto the slightly hard,\nconsistent texture, which\nwill then merge into an\nexplosive combination\nof hazelnut, almond, and\nhoney, with cilantro and\ncinnamon giving a final\nspecial touch to an absolutely glorious flavour.\nThe concepts of majesty,\nbeauty, and grandeur\nare all condensed\ninto one small\nsweet.\nThere is\nsomething I\nhave always\nfound really\npeculiar about\nthis sweet. The\nname, Alfajor,\ncomes from the\nSpanish-Arab\nal-has\u00fa, which\nessentially means\n\u201cthe filling\u201d. This\nis because the recipe\ncomes from an Arab\nE\nvery country in\nthe world seems\nto have its\nChristmas food.\nHere, they are Christmas\ncake and mince pies \u2013\nwhich disappointed me\nat first. A lot. But, hey,\nBritish food can grow on\nyou. Eventually.\nSquashed peach and\nalmond mince pies\nThis was the first\nmince pie I\u2019ve tried and\nI was a bit like \u201cWhere\nis the mince?\u201d Since\nthen I\u2019ve learnt what\nmince pies are and I must\ndefinitely confirm that\nthey are very nice with a\nglass of red wine.\nTraditional mince\npies \u2013 actually contain meat!\nThese are probably\nthe last ones I\u2019ve tried\nand I think they are fairly\ndifficult to find, with all\nthese sweet mince pies\nthat are around. They\nare interesting, to say\nat least, but they are\ndefinitely not a dessert.\nStill, I can see them as\na nice starter on most\nChristmas tables.\nadmit that these peach and\nalmond ones are my fa-vourite. They are soft with\nsome crunchy bits, and\nsweet enough to satisfy\nmy need for sugar.\nApple and satsuma\nmince pies\nThese are the softest\nmince pies I\u2019ve tried\nbecause the apples are\nnormally grated. I think\nthat apples and orange\nare normally a very good\nmix and they just scream\n\u2018Christmas is here\u2019.\nBesides, there are some\nversions that contain rum,\ntoo.\nCherry, mincemeat\nand liqueur mince\npies\nThe cherry and the\nliqueur add a luxurious\nside to the mince and,\nfor the brave one, they\ncan also be mixed with\na cocoa batter. This is\ndefinitely something\nspecial and dark \u2013 not an\neveryday mince pie but\nsomething to really enjoy.\nLottie Shaw\u2019s seriously good mince pies\nThese are sort of a\nmystery, if you ask me!\nThey claim to be the \u201cauthentic taste of Christmas\u201d\nand, weirdly, I feel like\nthey are \u2013 even if I have no\nidea what authentic mince\npies taste like. They are\nmouth-watering and the\npastry is delicious. Even if\nI cannot say for sure what\nthey are filled with, I can\nIf you\u2019re one of those\njolly lefties that can\u2019t\nstand this new notion of\n\u201ccultural appropriation\u201d,\njust keep in mind that\nwe in Spain have been\ncasually doing it for the\nbest part of a thousand\nyears.\n\n"

He is less\nenamoured by Emmanuel\nMacron, who takes a\nresounding victory in\nthe handshake wars and\ncrushes Trump\u2019s tiny\nhands.\nAugust: Trump tries\nto ban trans people from\nthe military. He also\noffers tacit support for\nwhite nationalists and\nother far-right extremists\nby claiming anti-fascist\ngroups were partially\nresponsible for violent\nclashes in Charlottesville.\nSeptember: Trump ends\nthe Deferred Action for\nChildhood Arrivals programme that allows young\nimmigrants to remain in\nthe US. He also attacks\nAmerican football players\nthat take the knee during\nthe national anthem and\ncalls for them to be fired.\nA new travel ban is signed\nand states immediately\ntake him to court over it.\nOctober: A terrifying\ncreature with an over\ninflated head and tiny\nhands is threatened by a\nchild in a T-rex costume.\nTrump can\u2019t resist taking\na shot at journalists, even\nwhen he\u2019s giving candy to\ntheir children.\nNovember: Trump\npardons a turkey. Jokes\nensue.\nDecember: The travel\nban is finally authorised.\nTrump admits \u2013 in a tweet\nsubsequently blamed\non his lawyers \u2013 that he\nknew Mike Flynn lied not\nonly to Pence, but to the\nFBI. He also recognises\nJerusalem as the capital of\nIsrael, inflaming tensions\nin the Israel-Palestine\nconflict.\nHaving a domestic\n(UK)\nA female leader with\ndiminishing popularity\ntakes her long-ruling party\nto the polls and comes out\non top despite losing seats\nin parliament. She turns to\nthe other parties, looking\nfor someone to prop up\nher government but things\ndon\u2019t look too good.\nIn a spectacular act of\nself-sabotage, Theresa\nMay called a totally\nunnecessary snap general\nelection and threw away\nher slender majority. This\ngave us a bizarre scenario\nin which the Conservatives, still the single\nlargest party in Parliament, were seen to have\nlost the election, whereas\nLabour, which won fewer\nseats in 2017 than it did\nin 1992 under Neil Kinnock\u2019s leadership, were\ncheered on as the winners.\nOther highlights\ninclude:\n\u2022 Brenda from\nBristol echoing the views\nof most people, excluding\npolitical commentators\n\u2022 Lord Buckethead,\nMr Fish finger and Elmo.\nNot the politicians we\nneed but the ones we\ndeserve\n\u2022 The unexpected\nbromance between\nGeorge Osborne and Ed\nBalls. It\u2019s astonishing\nhow much more tolerable\npoliticians become when\nthey\u2019re used as light entertainment\n\u2022 Jeremy Corbyn\ntrying to high five Emily\nThornberry and getting it\nvery, very wrong\nTime to avert your eyes... // Wikimedia\nbest (and worst) of what happened this year in politics\n\u201cIn a\nspectacular\nact of self-sabotage,\nTheresa\nMay called a\nunnecessary\nsnap general\nelection\u201d\n\u201cAfter Scotland\nshowed the\nworld how\nnot to achieve\nindependence,\nCatalonia had\na go\u201d\n\u2022 Anna Soubry and\nother former ministers\nbeing bitter and delighted\nat the exit poll\n\u2022 Corbyn sceptics\nsuddenly changing their\nminds and hailing Jeremy\nas the next messiah.\n(\u201cJeremy Corbyn and\nJesusChristsharethesame\ninitials. Coincidence? I\nthink not!\u201d \u2013 quote from a\nLabour backbencher with\nambitions of climbing the\ngreasy pole (probably).)\nThen came the Westminster sex pest dossier\nand Jared O\u2019Mara\u2019s old\nsocial media posts. Politicians fell as the scandal\nunfurled \u2013 most notably\nMichael Fallon, who was\nreplaced as defence secretary by former chief whip\nGavin Williamson (the\none with the pet tarantula).\nWhile it is an encouraging sign that parliament\nmay be beginning to take\nsexual harassment more\nseriously, the rush to\ncondemn people before\njob as international development secretary after\nshe was caught having\nmeetings with Israeli\nofficials while on holiday.\nTheresa May summoned\nPatel back to Downing\nStreet while she was on a\nvisit (official this time) to\nAfrica. Countless people\ntracked Patel\u2019s flight back\nto the UK, making her the\nsecond most-watched flier\nafter Father Christmas.\nPatel\u2019s resignation was a\ndelight to headline writers,\nwho went to town with\n\u201cPriti [insert derogatory\nadjective here]\u201d splashed\nacross the front pages of\nthe national press.\nWhen is a military\ncoup not a military\ncoup? (Zimbabwe)\nMajor General Sibusiso\nMoyo (a suspiciously\nmilitaristic title) became\nthe face of the coup/not\ncoup d\u2019etat in Zimbabwe\nwhen he told the world\nthat Robert Mugabe\nhad become a de facto\nex-dictator. After 37 years\nin power (and a speech in\nwhich he didn\u2019t resign),\nMugabe and his wife\nGucci Grace were finally\nforced out. Celebrators\nfilled the streets of Harare\nbut Zimbabwe\u2019s new\npresident \u2013 Emmerson\nMnangagwa, from the\nruling party Zanu-PF \u2013\nisn\u2019t much (if any) better.\nKnown as \u201cthe crocodile\u201d,\nMnangagwa is accused\nof organising massacres\nduring Zimbabwe\u2019s civil\nwar and attacks on opposition supporters after the\n2008 election.\nDonald the Dotard\nvs Little Rocket Man\n(North Korea)\nAgain, we\u2019re still alive.\nNorth Korea has continued to test missile tests\nand claims to be able to\nreach mainland America,\nthough experts are skeptical about the nation\u2019s\nability to mount minia-turised nuclear warheads\ncapable of withstanding\natmospheric re-entry. Kim\nJong-unisapparentlyopen\nto diplomatic solutions to\nthe growing tension but\nthat seems unlikely with\nTrump in power.\nAustralia\nLet\u2019s start with the good\nnews: Australia has legal-ised same-sex marriage.\nOr, as Independent MP\nBob Katter would prefer\nto think about, every three\nmonths a person is torn\nto death by a crocodile\nin north Queensland. (If\nyou haven\u2019t seen that clip,\nwatch it immediately. You\nwill not be disappointed.)\nOn a less positive note,\nrefugees and asylum\nseekers are still being held\nin appalling conditions on\nManus Island and Nauru.\nBrutality is rife and food\nis scarce. Despite growing\npressure, the government\nhas still not taken real\naction to close down the\ndetention camps (Austral-ia officially handed back\nfull control of Manus to\nPapua New Guinea but\nmany of those on the\nisland are there because\nAustralia refused to\nshelter them).\nGermany\nA female leader with\ndiminishing popularity\ntakes her long-ruling party\nto the polls and comes\nout on top despite losing\nseats in parliament. She\nturns to the other parties,\nlooking for someone to\nprop up her government\nbut things don\u2019t look too\ngood. Sound familiar?\nOf course Angela\nMerkel has a distinct\nadvantage over Theresa\nMay: Merkel doesn\u2019t have\nBoris Johnson, David\nDavis, and Liam Fox\nrepresenting Germany\u2019s\ninterests abroad.\nMartin Schulz, leader\n(at time of writing) of\nGermany\u2019s Social Democrats (SPD) is due to\nurge his party to enter into\ncoalition with Merkel\u2019s\nChristian Democratic\nUnion (CDU). Schulz\ninitially vetoed the idea\nbut his MPs have forced a\nu-turn. While this may be\ngood for political stability,\nit doesn\u2019t look great for\nSchulz\u2019s career.\nSpain\nAfter Scotland showed\nthe world how not to\nachieve independence,\nCatalonia decided to have\na go. What could \u2013 and\nshould \u2013 have been a\nnational debate turned\ninto a disaster. After a\nquestionable referendum\nand displays of police bru-tality, central government\nimposed direct rule and\ncalled for new elections to\nbe held later this month.\nFormer Catalan president Carles Puigdemont\nremains in Belgium,\nalthough a European\nArrest Warrant against\nhim has been dropped.\nWelcome to planet Venezuela! Entry\ncosts just $89 billion!\n(Venezuela)\nCreating \u2018planet Venezuela\u2019 is as good an idea\nas any and the Labour\nfront bench probably\nwouldn\u2019t mind a holiday\n(or as they\u2019re known\nin Westminster, \u2018group\nbonding sessions\u2019).\nPresident Nicol\u00e1s\nMaduro is attempting to\nrestructure the country\u2019s\nmassive debts to Russia\nand China in an effort to\navoid defaulting. Maduro\nhas blamed Venezuela\u2019s\neconomic crisis on US\nsanctions (which Trump\ntightened up earlier this\nyear). Meanwhile the\npeople are starving and\nselling toothpaste for\nmore than the fixed government price has become\npunishable by a five year\nprison sentence.\nObviously far more\nwent on this year than can\nbe covered here. Apologies for all the things that\nhaven\u2019t been mentioned.\nLet\u2019s hope 2018 is a better\nyear.\n\u201cSiri, find me a joke about wheat fields.
