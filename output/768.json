    "content": "Reviews FELIX, Wednesday March 18th198710 FILMS Children of a lesser God\nThis film is typical American crap\nwhich has predictably been nominated\nfor hundreds of Oscars. It is the story\nof the search for 'true', 'profound' love\nbetween James Leeds (William Hurt),\nwho is a hearing teacher of the deaf,\nand Sarah Norman (Martee Matlin)\nwho is a completely deaf cleaner in a school for the deaf and hard of\nhearing. Marlee Matlin is actually\nhearing Impaired in reality and so are\nall the actors who have parts as pupils\nat the sh cool. This fact makes the film\nseem incredible in its badness. It is a sentimental is ed idealised,\nglamour is ed, even pornographic\nrendition of romantic love, women,\nand deafness. Sarah Norman is\nportrayed as mysterious and beautiful'\nin her deafness. James falls in love\nwith her and persists with her until she\nreciprocates his feelings. He wins her\nover by falling into the school\nswimming pool which Sarah likes to\nswim in alone and na ken( and the\ncameraman loves it). When James falls\nin the pool he is fully clothed, and the\nscene, although 'funny' and 'touching'\nhas suggestions of the beautiful\nsensuous mermaid luring the sensitive\nmale into the water where she seduce\nhim. I found this inappropriate and\ntherefore disturbing. When it is\nestablished that Sarah and James love\neach other they move in together and\nthe film then focuses on the lovers'\nefforts to find adequate means of\ncommunication. Sarah's means of\ncommunication are sign language and\nsex, and she is brilliant at both. But\nthis is not good enough for James. At\nthe height of sexual passion he feels\ntie cannot get close enough to Sarah\nand wants her to be able to at least\nsay his name. However, Sarah\napparently dicovered at an early age\nthat when she tried to speak she didn't look beautiful anymore, so she gave\nup on learning to talk. No matter how\nhard James tries, Sarah won't try to\nspeak. Although one night when\nJames makes here desperate, Sarah\nrealm of communication between\nspeech and silence. What a happy\ncrappy 'meaningful' ending. The music\nthroughout contributes in working\nemotions up so that no one thinks too\nmuch. It even affected me, and I knew\nas soon as the film started that it was\na really bad film: The opening\nsequence shows Sarah writhing\nfrustrated ly around in bed with make-screams at him in a frightening,\nhorrific way and this convinces James\nthat he shouldn't make her speak if\nshe doesn't want to. Sarah goes home\nto her mother and, asserting her\nindependence, gets a job in a beauty\nsalon painting nails. Ultimately\nhowever, true love prevails and Sarah\nreturns to James. They agree, in sign\nlanguage to work out some middle\nup on\u2014and when I was expecting an\nhonest and serious film about deafness\nthis came as an immediate eye\nopener.\nI 've got nothing against this female\ndirector's( Randa Haines) attempt to\nmake a film on an emotive subject I just think she made it sensational and\nself-defeating ly sexist.\nCatherine Manolopoulos\nTHEATRE \"Shoestring Budget\"\nMoney, Money, Money! West End\nmusicals can't survive without it\u2014and\nso the punter is forced to pick up the\nbill. But you do get dazzling lights, sets\nthat really work, coming up through\nthe floor, flying in from the rafters and\neverywhere else. The final product?\nSlick.\nHigh Society is not a normal stage\nmusical; anyone expecting a carbon\ncopy of MGM's hit film of 1956 may\nas well save their pennies (and\noverdraft) as it's very different.\nRichard Eyre (Director of Guys and\nDolls, NT) has taken the original songs\nand padded the stage version out with\nother Cole Porter songs. It works, to\na degree.\nTrevor Eve, of Shoestring fame,\ntakes over the lead and obviously\nenjoys himself, although Natasha\nRichardson manages to command our\nattention through the majority of the\nshow. The chorus\u2014in many cases,\nDetter singers and dancers than the\nstars\u2014manage to keep a discreet\ndistance for the large part, but\ncompletely take over in That's Jazz.\nAs a film, High Society didn't have\nchorus numbers and so Eyre closes the\nfirst half with Well Did You Ever?,\nsung by stars and chorus alike. It\nseems a shame that this particular\nsong has lost its original duet form,\nalthough the chances of Trevor Eve\nand Stephen Rea improving upon The\nCrooner and Old Blue Eyes rendition\nis slim.\nThe songs that Crosby and Sinatra\nmade so famous come across nicely\nbut unfortunately the best number is\nnot from the film. Angela Richards'\nrendition of In the Still of the Night is\nhaunting and beautifully staged,\nsimplicity rearing its head high above\nthe raz ma tazz.

The only true complexity\nis uncertainty\u2014everything else is\npretension and artificiality. Yet there\nis a fundamental human drive which\ninsists on the hidden meaning and the\nmystical interpretation. And this\nstems, illogically, from the insecurity\nand fear which drives most of us to the\nconsoling gods of power, wackiness,\nand investigation. There are one\nthousand and one such gods and all\nof them sing in silence or suffer out\nof tune.\nI browsed through the Serpentine\nGallery yesterday.

Be very consoled.\nAnd now the thought of dinosaurs\nare plodding about my brain. They are\nquite unlike the neural crickets which\nchirped only a month ago. 'Raffle\nyourself they said.

    "content": "Letters. FELIX, Wednesday March 18th1987 Not Jelly-roll\nMorton\nDear Dave,\nAll pop and other non-classical\nrecordings in the Haldane Library are\nbought by an annually-elected Student\nRecord Buyer out of Union funds, and\nnot. as many users believe, by the\nLibrary. This session students have\nevery right to complain about the lack\nof new recordings since this year's Student Record Buyer. Adrian\nJohnson (Aero II). has failed almost\ntotally to carry out the job for which\nhe was elected, in spite of efforts by\nus and Union officers to get him to\ndo so. He has bought only 33\nrecordings so far compared to the\nnormal average at this time of year\nof about 150. and he has ignored our\nrequests to get on with the job. He has\nalso taken away request cards and\nkept them so that we have no idea\nwho has asked for what. To those of\nyour readers who are rightly\ncomplaining to us (and blaming us for\nwhat Johnson has failed to do), I have\nto say that the Library can do\nnothing\u2014it is the Union to which he\nis answerable.\nWhy should Johnson be permitted\nto get away with behaviour which so\ninsults the Union and those of its\nmembers who elected him? And why\nshould your readers have to wait until\nnext year (when many will have left)\nfor their requests to be satisfied? I am\nnot aware that Union record funds can\nbe carried over from one session to\nanother, so money not spent this\nsession will presumably be totally\nlost.\nYours sincerely,\nRichard G. Williams,\nHaldane Librarian.\nVoice of the\nUnion?\nDear Dave,\nDuring my time here at Imperial\nCollege of Science and Technology\nI have been led to believe that the\nUnion is a non-political body\nconcerned with the non-academic side\nof student life, as well as student\nwelfare; FELIX, being the voice of\nthe Union should, presumably, reflect\nthis.\nAccordingly, I was very surprised\nto find that the article about the\naddress by Tony Benn should merit\na front page position, whilst a talk by\nSir Clive Sinclair (a true pioneer in\nthe fields of Computing and Electrical\nEngineering) to over 300 students, did\nnot even receive a mention.\nI trust that this omission was merely\nan oversight by the Editor and not an\nattempt to bias our political judgement\n(talks by Sir Geoffrey Howe and Cecil\nParkinson also did not receive a mention).\nYours sincerely,\nMichael van Messel, Phvsics III.\nVoicing\nObjections\nDear Dave,\nOnce again sabbatical elections are\nupon us, and once again interest in\nICU is at such an unprecedented level\nthat there are less candidates than ever\nfor the four posts and the Hustings\nUGM was numerically in quo rate( despite some creative accounting).\nHowever, the STV system of\nproportional representation allows for\nthe populace to register its\ndissatisfaction with candidates by\nabstention so that where the\nabstention vote outnumbers the total\nvotes for all candidates, the election\nmust be re-run from scratch with new\ncandidates being allowed to take part.\nBut lo! We already have one\ncandidate 'elected' unopposed. Was\nthe populace allowed to register their\ndissatisfaction here and require a re-run? (No comment is intended here\nabout the actual candidate concerned;\nthe same situation has arisen almost\nevery year I 've been here and has\nalways seemed equally iniquitous).\nNo vote is taken on single candidates,\nand yet the method by which\ncandidates can essentially be rejected\nworks just as well whether there are\none or more running for a post. Why\naren't we allowed to make our voice\nheard just because apathy was so rife\nthat someone had no opposition?\nYours sincerely,\nJA Fagandini, EE IV.\nNATO\noffensive\nDear Dave,\nI read the article on collective\ndefence by David Burns in last week's FELIX. There were some major\ninaccuracies in what he reported.\nWhen Tony Benn spoke at Imperial\nabout two weeks ago he did indeed\nadvocate the withdrawal from NATO\nbut he stated that his views on defence\ndiffered from those of the majority of\nthe Labour Party in that he wanted a strong nuclear deterrent outside\nNATO. The 'opinion' by David\nBurns implies that Mr Benn wanted\nno nuclear deterrent. I think most\npeople in Britain would clearly argue\nthat if there is a nuclear armour y on\nthis soil then it should be controlled\ntotally by this Government. It is the\nopinion of most of the people with\nwhom I have discussed this that at\npresent this is not the case. It seems\nto me that this is what Mr Benn\nwanted. The article then goes on to\nimply that only the Soviets train their\nforces 'in a highly'offensive role' but\nin Eastern Africa (Kenya) the Marines\nare trained in offensive roles to attack\nthe Soviet forces in Ethiopia and they\nmaintain unnecessarily large bases in\nMombasa and Malindi. Mr David\nBurns needs to research his articles\nmore clearly in future so as to avoid\ngiving his readers a biased inaccurate\nview.\nYours sincerely,\nW Murambu.\nCounsel for\nthe defence\nDear Dave,\nI am sorry that Mr Murambu finds\nmy research inadequate. As far as I know Tony Benn MP has of recent\nyears stood on an entirely non-nuclear\nplatform and I am amazed that anyone\nshould suggest otherwise. As for\nKenyan Marines in Ethiopia, after\nextensive additional research, I am\nunable to find a single reference to\nKenya ever having been a member of\nthe North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganisation, and it was NATO to\nwhich my article was devoted.\nDave Burns\nSecond\nthoughts\nDear FELIX,\nReading Mr R. Brown's letter in\nFELIX 6/3/87, one is left with the\nimpression that he is guilty of the\nnarrow-mindedness of which he\naccuses the respondents to his original\nletter. He seems to assume that since\nthe respondents do not agree with him\nthey have not \"listened with open\nhearts.\" I'm sure if they re-read it\ncarefully a thousand times over they\nwould still come to the same\nconclusion, as would Mr Brown.\nWhat's the big deal in having \"friends\nwho are or have been prostitutes,\nheroin addicts, alcoholics or\ntramps\"\u2014a friend is a friend is a friend.\nYours sincerely,\nVijay Kumar\nAnother man\nspeaks\nDear Dave,\nOne can't help feeling that Clare\nMurphy's concern (FELIX March\n~6th) for the rights of women is a bit\nmisdirected.\nI would think that there are few\npeople on either side of the argument\nover abortion who would fail to have\ncompassion for the woman who finds\nshe has conceived a child and faces\nthe prospect of nine months\npregnancy and of birth with dread.\nIf indeed, then, the solution is to\nallow the woman to \"choose what is\ngoing to happen to her body\" should\nwe not, before pushing this too\nstrongly, allow and encourage her to\nknow what the facts relevant to this\nchoice are? That the foetus, as shown\nfor instance by the technique of In\nVitro Fertilization (as well as medical\nevidence and human experience) is\nnot her own body but that of another\nindividual; that the abortion operation\nis not as simple as having an appendix\nout\u2014perhaps films of what actually\nhappens to the woman's body and the\nfoetus should be shown more widely,\nin the cause of women's rights; that\nmany, probably the majority, of\nwomen who have had abortions suffer\ngreat mental traumas (Post Abortion\nSyndrome\u2014see the current issue of\nThe Spectator).\nBut perhaps more importantly, it\ndoes appear that Ms Murphy's advice\n(along with many others) belies a rather dangerously cavalier attitude\ntowards sexuality and the creation of\nlife. Is it really helpful to advocate\nabortion as a long-stop to\n'contraception failure,\" suggest\nwilful conception as \"wrecking good\nprospects\" of being a \"baby\nmachine\" and, indeed, derogate a father attempting to care for and take\nresponsibility for his and his partner's child as dastardly \"daring\"? Does all\nthis not, thus, di courage the woman\nfrom regarding her womb as it is, an\ninherent and positive part of her\nsexuality through which new life is\ncarefully and magnificently fostered,\nbut rather encourage it to be seen,\nalmost, as just a dustbin of desire?\nDoes this advice not, indeed,\ndiscourage us from regarding this new\nlife as the good and valuable thing\neach of us knows it is, but rather\nencourage the woman and society\n(and the father of course please) to\nregard it as a silly disease?\nIt is perhaps no wonder to find,\nwhere such attitudes are prevalent,\ndistraught and confused unexpectedly\npregnant women; so distraught and\nconfused as to go through with an\nabortion.\nYours sincerely,\nHugh MacKenzie, Civ Eng RA\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion FELIX, Wednesday March 18th1987 Glad to be gay, sad to be hated\nIn the past month or so a great deal\nof attention has been devoted to the\nsubject of Gay and Lesbian people at\nImperial College, with the co-opting\nonto Council of Robert Daniel as\nLesbian and Gay welfare officer\nleading to a healthy level of debate in\nthe FELIX letters page.\nThe above decision has been\ncriticised, albeit constructively, by\nmany who in my opinion do not fully\nunderstand the situation. I must admit\nthat the atmosphere at Imperial\nCollege towards minorities is\nimproving, however slowly. I don't think that this is nearly enough.\nOne of the functions of any\neducation should be, as the clich e has\nit, to prepare the individual for life. My\ninterpretation of this is that the\nchildhood or teenage prejudices\npeople entertain when they arrive\nhere should for the most part have\nvanished by the time they leave,\nhopefully producing a generation of\nresponsible and open minded adults.\nI believe that with respect to the\naverage attitude to homosexuality,\nImperial is failing, and badly.\nFor Gays and Lesbians, the\natmosphere here is not good. The\ndegree of hostility and ignorance\ndisplayed by some has to be seen to\nbe believed. All the old clich es which\nI thought had gone for good have\nbeen trotted out in conversation by\npeople who I had previously regarded\nas being intelligent and aware. Lines\nlike:\n\"Of course, when queer men do it,\nthere's so much blood about\"\n\"While you are setting up a Gaysoc,\nwhy don't you set up a Child Molester\nsoc for good measure?\"\n\"Most Of these homos are com mies you know.\"\n\"Hitler may have been rough on the\nJews, but he had the right idea about\npansies.\"\n\u2014and one which really made me\nlaugh:\n\"I don't mind you being..er..gay, but\nyou'd better keep away from my\ndaughter!\"\nNo, I don't understand that one\neither.\nSeeing these stupidities in cold print\ndoes make you realise that society in\ngeneral, and Imperial in particular, has\na problem. People don't seem to\nrealise that such statements can be\nextremely hurtful. Even the best we\ncan expect is not great. Several people\nhave said to me:\n\"It's OK by me if you're gay, as long\nas you don't mess with me.\"\nI suppose this is well meant, but I still\nfind it rather insulting. Why should I want to mess with them anyway? As\nfor the other sentiments above, I can\nassure readers that 1 am not a com mie or a child molester, and if there really\nwas a lot of blood about when I 'did\nit' I certainly wouldn't 'do it' at all. Mind you, remember that this sort\nof thing is about the best we can\nexpect from a lot of people. The worst\ncan be very bad indeed.\nI spent my last summer vacation at\nhome in Cornwall, and towards the\nend of the holiday I was attacked by\nthree men with knives; despite my\nbest efforts I wound up in hospital. The\nreason for the attack was simple: They\nhad discovered that I was gay. This\nwas the only reason. I had neither\nrobbed them, assaulted them or\nthreatened them. 1 didn't even know\nthem. I am sure you can understand\nmy wish to promote a society in which\nthis doesn't happen.\nHow can this be done? Obviously,\npeople have to be shown that their\nfears and prejudices are groundless.\nGays and Lesbians need to stand up\nand say:\"Look, here I am. I'm not so\nbad really, am I?\"1 realise that this is the hell of a step\nto take. I should know: I have.\nEncouragingly, at least at Imperial, I have had very little hassle...yet.\nHaving said that, it is not for me to tell\npeople to 'come out of the closet' at\nImperial. This is a decision which can\nonly be made by the individual. I do\nfeel, though, that the more who do\nthis, the better it will be for all of us,\ngay or not. Remember that many here\nhave never met anyone who has\ndeclared themselves homosexual:\nHow can they know what we are like?\nIn years to come, 1 would like to be\nable to write about this subject without\nusing the words 'us' and 'them'. If this\nis to happen, the change must come\nfrom everyone.\nLet's try, shall we?\nAndrew Bannister\n'\nNORMAN'S' WILL BE OPEN FOR\nTHE EASTER VAC AT LUNCHTIMES\nWEEKDAYS UNTIL\nFRIDAY 10TH APRIL\n\"All the usual fine food and sarcasm\"\n(The Union Bar will be open as well)\nUROP '87\nThe 1987 Directory for the Undergraduate Research\nOpportunities Programme is now available from your\nDepartmental Vacation Training Officer. About 120 members\nof staff are offering undergraduates the chance to join in their\nresearch and the Directory gives the details.\nThe name of the game is participation and undergraduates\njoining the scheme will be working, in their own time,\nalongside postgraduates and research assistants, on an actual\nresearch programme. Whilst you can start at any time, the\nmain activities are in the vacations. In the summer, many\nof the supervisors are able to offer payment for your efforts.\nThe scheme is organised so that the payment is in the form\nof a bursar y, so you don't pay tax or NH1 contributions and\nforeign students do not need a work permit. Whilst the\namount is negotiable with your supervisor, the recommended\nmaximum is \u00a375 per week for ten weeks.\nThis year the Old Centralians are offering some summer\nbursa ries for City & Guilds students to work in UROP.\nApplications have to be in by the end of term.\nAfter a successful try-out last year, the University of\nDelaware in the States is offering five UROP places for IC\nstudents this summer. Details are given in the Directory.\nTo get your copy, see your Departmental Vacation Training\nOfficer or contact Professor JC Anderson, Room 713,\nElectrical Engineering Department.\n\n"

    "content": "Featura FELIX, Wednesday March 18th1987 The death penalty has been abolished\nin more than ten countries since 1977,\nreflecting the worldwide trend away\nfrom execution as a form of\npunishment. During this time, there\nhas been an upsurge in the number of\ndeath sentences and of executions in\nthe United States of America.\nAmnesty International considers that\nthe death penalty is a \"cruel and\ninhuman punishment, brutal ising to\nall who are involved in the process.\"\nIts unconditional opposition is based\non the belief that no crime, no matter\nhow repugnant, can justifiably be\nresponded to by the cruel treatment\nof prisoners. The United States come\nunder special scrutiny, being one of\nthe very few western states to retain\nthe death penalty.\nThe advocates of the death penalty\noften claim that it acts as a deterrent.\nHowever, many papers which have\nbeen written on the subject (including\nthose by official UN and US\nresearchers) have concluded that most\nintending murderers do not consider\nthe consequences of their actions.\nTwenty eight American states\nTexas between 1973 and 1977, blacks\nwho killed whites were at least five\ntimes more likely to receive a death\nsentence than whites who killed\nwhites. In addition, in Florida, blacks\nwho killed whites were 40 times more\nlikely to be sentenced to death than\nthose whose victims were black.\nIt has been suggested that the\ncorrelation of low social standing with\ndeath sentences is due to the lack of\npublic sympathy for such people.\nHowever, a far more obvious factor\nis their inability to hire good defence\nconviction-prone and less concerned\nabout constitutional rights and wrong\nconvictions than juries which were\nrepresentative of the general public's view. This was deemed to be a violation of the defendent's rights.\nThe practice of \"plea-bargaining\"\nalso produces some unexpected\nsentences. The prosecuting counsel\nmay decide to offer not to prosecute\nfor a capital offence, if the defendent\npleads guilty to a lesser offence or\nagrees to testify against a co-defendent. Texas juries also take into\n%\n... \u00ab&\u2022\nft tH hostage with his accomplice and was\nbuying petrol at the time of the\nmurder. The Georgia Supreme Court\nfound that although he did no commit\nmurder, he \"should not have left the\nvictim alone with a man he knew to\nbe dangerous.\"\nThe most disturbing justification for\nthe death penalty is that it is a fitting\nform of retribution such \"legal\nveng ance,\" the rep it it ion of the very\nacts which society condemns, appears\nto be both immoral and illogical. No\ncivilised country authorise s the raping\nof rapists or the burning of arsonists'\nproperty. The taking of human life is\nfar more serious an issue even than\nthese matters. The innocent\nvictims\u2014the families of those on\ndeath row and of those executed, and\nindeed, those people wrongly\nexecuted (at least 23 in the USA this\ncentury) receive a far greater\npunishment than could ever reason bly be justified for the guilty.\nThose sentenced to death do not just\nsuffer the loss of life. They often\nspend many years on \"death row\",\nin most states confined for hours in\nDEATH IN THE USA\nauthorise the execution of murderers\nwho were under 18 at the time of the\ncrime and there have been several\nrecent cases of mentally retarded or\nill defendent s being sentenced to\ndeath. In one such case, the defendent\nhad an IQ of only 65, with just 20\nfewer he could have been\ninstitutional is ed. Three of the eight\nknown executions of under age\noffenders, since 1980, were in the\nUnited States, despite the US\nGovernment having signed\ninternational and national treaties\nrejecting such action.\nAnother argument in favour of\nexecution is one of economy,\npreventing the expense of supporting\na prisoner perhaps for fifty years or\nmore. This overlooks the fact that\ncapital trials necessarily involve an\nenormous amount of judicial time and\ngreat expense, which can be more\nthan twice as much as the cost of life\nimprisonment. The belief that\nexecution is necessary to protect\nsociety from the convicted murderers\nis unfounded: of the 2646 mu der ers who were released between 1900 and\n1976 in 12 states, only 16 were\nconvicted of later criminal homicides.\nMany people have criticised the\nway in which the passing of the death\nsentence depends significantly on\narb it ary factors such as race and social\nstatus, as well as location,\ncomposition of the jury and\ncompetence of the trial counsel. One\nstudy showed that in Florida and\nlawyers. Between 1972 and 1976,\n62% of those sentenced to death were\nunskilled and overall 60% were\nunemployed only 3% were\nprofessionals or technical workers.\nThe exclusion of capital juries in\nmost states of those who oppose the\ndeath penalty is another apparent\nanomaly. An Akansas court found\nthat the resulting juries were more\naccount the projected \"future\ndangerous ness\" of a defendent. These\nand other me a a sure s have resulted in\nsuch disparities that for example, in\n1985, Doyle Skillern was executed\njust before his \"equally guilty\"\naccomplice became eligible for\nparole. Other strange results include\nthe execution of Roosevelt Green\nwho, having robbed a shop, left the\ncells less than 6ft by 9ft, with no\nwindows or natural light, poor\nsanitation and no opportunities for\nrehabilitation, with social or\noccupational facilities. Many\nprisoners as a result suffer mental or\npsychological damage and while this\ncauses obvious problems for those\nlater released, psychiatrists are often\nrequired to treat insane prisoners so\nthat they might be fit for execution.\nThis, as well as the involvement of\nhealth personnel in the actual\nexecution, raises serious questions\nabout medical ethics. It is\ncompounded by severe doubts as to\nthe lack of physical cruelty involved\nin the death penalty itself. There have\nbeen well-documented reports of\nprisoners having prolonged\nconvulsions when subjected to lethal\ngas, and cases of several electric\nshocks being required over a period\nof up to seventeen minutes before the\nprisoner could be declared dead. Even\nsuch methods as hanging, the firing\nsquad or lethal injection have caused\nextreme pain to several prisoners.\nThe respected physicist and former\nSoviet dissident Andre Sakharov has\ndeclared \"I regard the death penalty\nas a savage and immoral institution\nthat undermines the moral and legal\nfoundations of a so ce it y.I regret the\nnotion that the death penalty has any\nessential deterrent effect on potential\noffenders. I am convinced that the\ncontrary is true\u2014that savagery begets\nonly savagery.\n\n"

    "content": "Felix FELIX, Wednesday March 18th19876 Christine's The letter from a group of civil\nengineering postgraduates (FELIX\n11/3) seems to have caused\nwidespread consternation around the\nCollege. It is most ironic that it was\nprinted when it was. Last Friday the\nGoverning Body of Imperial College\napproved a plan to offset a large\nprojected budget deficit. As well as\nincreasing revenue from research\ncontracts, the aim is to 'lose' one\nhundred staff and to recruit one\nhundred extra overseas students over\nthe next year. Some of the one\nhundred staff will be academics\ntransferred onto research grants but\nthe majority it seems will be real job\nlosses from academic, technical and\nnon-technical staff. Since the\nacademics hold the balance of power\nat College it is not difficult to imagine\nwhere most of the job losses will\nactually come from. It's worth noting\nthat there is nobody on Governing\nBody to represent the non-academic\nstaff; it seems to fall to the Students'\nUnion and those external governors\nwith Trade Union sympathies to\nattempt to put forward their\nviewpoints.\nAs for recruiting a hundred extra\noverseas students, it would be\nludicrous to pretend that this extra\nBits\nincrease in numbers (regardless of\nnationality) is not going to put\nconsiderable strain on central,\ndepartmental and accommodation\nfacilities.\nThe plan approved by the\nGovernors may be felt to be essential,\nbut its effects are likely to be\ndamaging; fewer \"teachers\", even\nmore emphasis on research; less\ntechnical support; more\novercrowding; even worse\naccommodation shortage. Sad day\nindeed.\nWas it Worth it?\nIn today's financial climate it is\ninevitable that students (especially\nfrom overseas) are seen more and\nmore as Income to the College.\nRecruitment has to be done, but there\nshould at least be some honest about\nthe situation.\nHow many students here feel they\nwere misled by IC's recruitment\ndrive? Most of the recruitment\nliterature I have seen is pretty honest\nabout things like accommodation but\nhow true a picture it paints of the\nacademic life in departments it is hard\nto say. (Incidentally this is why the\nUnion's Alternative Prospectus is so\nnecessary) I can only hope that the\ncomplaints outlined in the letter in the\nlast FELIX are not too widespread.\nAs for those particular complaints,\nthey have not gone unnoticed by the\nCollege, but if some of the students\nconcerned would contact me (int\n3501) or Gareth Fish, the Union's PG\nAcademic Affairs Officer (via Union\nOffice) we will follow up your\nspecific problems as far as possible.\nThis applies to any other post grads with academic grievances.\nAlternatively you could contact your\ndepartment's PG tutor\u2014who is\nsupposed to deal with problems like\nthis.\nInformation and Publicity\nIt seems I owe everybody an\napology for my part in failing to\npublicise the big NUS march a few\nweeks back. This was not due to any\nwish to keep Imperial as insular as\npossible. As the NUS send IC Union\nno information we (ie, Union\nOfficers) learn about such matters in\nmuch the same way as anybody else.\nIt is most unfortunate that none of us\nwho were vaguely aware of the event\nremembered to put it in FELIX.\nThere does seem to be a separate\ninformation problem here, though.\nTake the ULU 50% cuts situation for\nexample. If we can have 4000 leaflets\ndistributed in FELIX, several articles\nin FELIX including a front page\nheadline, two UGM motions, a guest\nspeaker and a poster campaign\u2014and\nstill be told that the Union had not told\nthe students anything about it (letters,\nFELIX 6/3) then I wonder where the\nproblem really lies. Unfortunately\nfour sabbaticals can't be omnipresent\nto tell everyone about everything in\nperson. After the sabbaticals and\nstaff, a students' union is only as good\nas the students who get involved in\nit, after all. Constructive suggestions\nand practical help are more than\nwelcome from anyone who thinks we\nshould be doing better.\nNorman's Lives On\nThe good news is that the Union\nSnack Bar will be open as usual\nduring the day time over Easter. So\nanyone who's still around can get real\nfood, real coffee, etc, etc, at probably\nthe cheapest prices in London\u2014\nwithout those awful term-time\nqueues. Ground Floor, Union\nBuilding, Beit Quad\u2014for anyone\nwho's not discovered it yet.\nFinally\nA request for volunteers\n(particularly women) to work for the\nWomen's National Cancer Control\nCampaign. WNCCC produces\ninformation about cervical and breast\ncancer detection and organises seven\nmobile screening clinics. They are\nflexible about hours and are based\nnear College, off Park Lane\u2014so if\nanyone can spare them a few hours\na week, let me know and I 'll give you\nfurther details.\nThat's all for now, have a good\nEaster break...\nLove Christine.\nOpinion; Bedtime for Democracy?\nMark Cot tle Having been severely disillusioned by\nthe recent fiasco of a Presidential\nelection I am convinced that the\nUnion Constitution needs re-examining. It is apparent from student\nreaction to Union General Meetings\nthat the Union is failing to attract the\ninterest of its members to important\nmatters which may affect their\nfacilities, welfare and rights. In this\nsituation it is clearly possible that the\nUnion could eventually end up being\nrun by anyone who cares to be pushy\nenough, with no regard for anyone\nwho disagrees with them.\nThe most important part of the\nUnion in terms of whether it serves\nits members or tries to make them\nserve it, is the Executive. A poor\nExecutive will impose its own\nopinions rather than represent other\npeople's. Last year's President and\nDP were severely censured for this\nattitude, but little could be done to\nactually make them take any notice.\nWe can either pray for saintly people\nto be elected or look at the whole\nConstitution to find ways in which the\nflow of opinion from students to their\nrepresentatives can be made more\neffective.\nOne obvious thing to do is make\nsure you are electing the right people.\nIt is unfortunate that all electors in\nCollege-wide elections have to judge\ncandidates on the information\nproduced by those candidates. There\nare UGM speeches and questions but\nthese are very limited. I would like\nto see some way for candidates to be\npersonally challenged. At least in\nnational elections we can see\npoliticians being grilled by\ninterviewers. Of course there are\nproblems of media bias. There is also\na good case for restricting questions\nto keep out spiteful personal attacks.\nBut the electorate has a right to\nchallenge those who seek to lead it.\nI find it very worrying when I encounter people who try to clamp\ndown on freedom to speak out and\nquestion as happened at the beginning\nof the Hustings UGM.\nMy second point about elections\nconcerns the role of the returning\nofficer and the election committee in\ninterpreting the election rules. This\nyear Dave Colley has been zealous in\nhis enforcement of the rules.\nUnfortunately he has also been rather\nerratic in his interpretation of those\nrules and has occasionally come close\nto allowing his own personal opinion\nto override them. It has always\nseemed to me that if something is not\nspecifically and explicitly laid down\nin such rules then it is not up to one\nperson to decide \"the spirit of the\nrules\" and effectively decide a new\none. I realise Dave was trying to be\nfair in his own mind but I still find\nhis action disturbing.\nFinally on a more positive note I want to suggest that the representation\nsystem in the Union is overhauled.\nMost people do not want to have to\nsit through long and boring meetings\njust to take an interest in one or two\npoints. Therefore I suggest we come\nup with some way to cut down the\namount of bickering on political\nissues that occurs at UGMs. If there\nwas an alternative forum for debate\nof all types to which interested parties\ncould go, then only more meaningful\nbusiness could be sent on to a UGM.\nThis would cut out irrelevant motions\nsuch as those concerning national\npolitical issues un-related to students\nand joke motions. I hope the Union\nPlanning Group might consider ideas\nalong these lines with particular\nattention to the future role of Council\nand the Exec.\nAdditionally, I don't think the\nsystem of elected reps of all sorts is\nnecessarily the best way of gathering\nthe views of students generally. I would like to see a better use of\nsurveys and referendums to try to get\na response from people who would\nnot normally attend committees. This\nyear's survey which I helped produce\nhas shown that it is possible to get an\nextremely useful response in such a manner. The survey inevitably had its\nflaws which are now revealed, I hope\nwhoever is around next year will learn\nfrom this experience. Ultimately if\nstudent unions won't try to be\nexperimental models for new\ndemocracy what hope is there\nelsewhere?\nWELLSOC\nMEMBERS\nare invited to\nsubmit articles or\nstories for next\nyear's Wellsian.\nPrizes of \u00a310 and\n\u00a35 for the best\nentries\n\n"

But Imperial's extraordinary coach Bill Mason was\nfar from happy. Make no mistake,\nhowever, Imperial has now proved\nitself superior to Oxford.\nThe confrontation took place at\nReading Head. Imperial were\ncontesting the inaugural race for the\nMackintosh Trophy, awarded to the\nfastest university crew. Conditions\ncould hardly have been worse:\nsporadic snowfalls and a strong wind\nconspired against the competitors.\nThe wind whipped up large waves\nand the snow dampened everyones'\nenthusiasm for a fifteen minute race.\nIn a head race crews row over a set\ncourse, one team following the next\nafter a gap of around fifteen seconds.\nHance, the result cannot be assessed\ni mme did at ely. Bill Mason (once\nOlympic silver medallist) saw his first\neight row past three places behind\nOxford. IC Looked to be performing\nso much below their usual potential\nthat Bill hardly recognised them. The\ncrew felt the same way about their\nrow and were utterly disconsolate.\nImagine their surprise the, when the\nresults were announced. Despite so\nobviously failing to perform as\nexpected, IC beat Oxford and ran\naway with the Mackintosh Trophy.\nThe second eight were likewise\nfrustrated with their performance.\nBut, their disappointment also belied\na magnificent performance. They\ncame second in the Mackintosh\nTrophy and also second in the Senior\nA division. Perhaps only four other\nuniversity first crews could perform\nas well as this.\nImperial's success extended to the\ntwo other crews racing. Imperial stole\nthe Senior C pennant and also won the\nnovice category. The Novices in\nparticular performed extraordinarily\nwell. They rowed in a thirty year-old\nwooden boat, which looked quaint\nand ungainly beside the modern\nlightweight boats used by all their\nadversaries. Despite this disadvantage\nthe novices, who all learned to row\nat IC this year beat their nearest rivals\nconvincingly.\nRSM Football\nPistol Competition, Wednesday March 4th; UCL,\nKings College, LSE and IC\nPistol over the opposition\nRifle and Pistol Club\nIt was 6 o 'clock on March 4th when\nthe teams arrived at the range for the\nULU pistol competition, four teams\nof four people were competing from\nUCL, Kings College, the LSE and of\ncourse IC. Each team member was to\nshoot ten shots at each of two targets\ngiving a maximum team score of 800.\nThere was also to be an individual top\nten competition. As the competition\nprogressed it quickly became obvious\nthat only two teams would be in\ncontention for first place, IC and\nKings.\nAlthough the scores were only\nannounced at the end, King's had\nevidently been out-psyched by a superb IC team performance. It began\nwhen our first shooter S Considine\ndropped one shot due to running out\nof time and still scored more than\ntheir best. Our next two both scored\nvery highly, tying for top score. The\nhonours went to P Deeks over S Brooker on the number of inner bulls.\nEven the supposed 'weak link' in the\nform of last minute sub R Winskill\ncame 4th individually. When the final\nscores were announced the expected\nIC domination was confirmed. The\nfinal scores were:\nTeam scores Individual comp.\nIC 701 1) P Decks 180\nKing's5482) S Brooker 180\nLSE 405 3) S Considine 174\nUCL 327 4) R Winskill 167\nForename \"nickname\"\nsurname\nOnce again, for the second season in\nsuccession, RSM l sts have emerged\nvictorious, this time finishing as\nchampions of Division One by a massive margin. The side maintained\nits superb early form after the mad\nbeer-drinking excesses of Christmas\nto vanquish the mealy-mouthed\nopposition to all-comers, and earn the\nright to hammer IC l sts into\nsubmission next season, while at the\nsame time packing the yokels and\ninbreeds of Camborne and Cardiff\nback on their way by scores of 4-2\nand 7-1 respectively.\nThe main deciding factor in the\nteam's triumph has to be its\nconsistency and lack of any one weak\nlink; everybody is equally crap! The\ngoalkeeper and singularly uninspiring\ncaptain Andy 'Elephant Bottom'\nReeves had twenty six shots to save\nall season, and twenty five of them\nwent in, the full backs Dave\nConneybeare and Tim Hardwick are\nalways steady (a.k.a. useless) while\nthe central defenders, Alex 'Chopper'\nWardle, Keith McScotty, Old Man\nNige Owen and Trevor Watkins are\nall noted for leaving silvery trails\nwherever they may go.\nThe midfield comprised Martin\nBrook, Andy Lett, Steve Woodward,\nPhil Fury, Gurel Turk and Dave\nBumzdoggs and they constituted the\nmost foul-mouthed, unpleasant,\nunwashed, slovenly group of raving\nhomosexuals ever unfit to grace\nGod's clean earth. The attack scored\noccasionally but was generally to be\nseen disappearing over the horizon or\nwaving to the crowd. Still, Amin\nJafar Cake and Tim 'if it moves kick\nit and if it doesn't, glass it' Fisher\nmade up the numbers and were\nalways good Canadians.\nEddie Gadd played once and got\ncramp after twenty minutes.

So, cruelly reduced to eight\nmen, the sixths, with a combination\nof teamwork and an outstanding\nperformance in defence from Brian\nRadukic, battled well and were\nunlucky to be 3-1 down at half time.\nThe St George's goals all came from\npenalty-area scrambles when the man\nto man-and-a half marking system\nbroke down.\nIn the second half St George's scored after ten minutes to go. Irwin\nChin playing his last game for\nImperial again narrowed the deficit\nwith his second and better goal of the\nmatch and season. Having rounded a defender from Mike Harper's through\nball, a delicate chip beat the oncoming\ngoalkeeper, to make the score 4-2.\nSwapping goalkeeper Mike Kemp\nwith the now cramp-stricken Irwin\nChin didn't produce any more goals\nand so with a moral victory the sixths\nretired to the bar to make the most of\na surfeit of tea tickets.\nThanks to all 36 players who have\nmade intermittent appearence s this\nseason and have shown a level of\ncommitment and enthusiasm worthy\nof any team in the club making my\njob far easier.

    "content": "Feature FELIX, Wednesday March 18th198714 The power of the press\nOn the January 24th last year, five |\nand a half thousand print workers of\nthe Sun, The Times and the News of\nthe World went on strike and were\ndismissed. Rupert Murdoch, the\npaper's owner did not need them\nanymore. He had been putting the\nfinishing*touches to a new. high-tech\nplant in Wapping in the preceding\nmonths, and simply moved\nproduction there. The unions were\npowerless to stop him.\nIn the 70's this would have been\nunthinkable: No-one would have been\nprepared to operate the Wapping\nplant, and if they had tried, it would\nhave been picketed en masse and\nnothing would have been able to get\nin or out. Moreover, nationwide\ndistribution would have been\nparalysed: Murdoch would have been\nforced to give in.\nThis shift in strength was of course\ncaused by the Thatcher government\nand the economic conditions\nprevailing since it came to power. The\ntwo main unions involved, the NGA\nand Sogat '82, did try to set the\nwheels of the once-formidable union\nnetwork in motion, but they were\nfrustrated at almost every turn by the\nnew Trade Union Laws, Rupert\nMurdoch's careful planning and the\nchange in attitudes since the 70s. Before they could even call for a strike, the Union leaders heeded a majority in a secret ballot or they\nwould have been liable to prosecution\nand the sequestration of their funds\nat the hands of Murdoch's lawyers.\nThey could not get the operators of\nthe new plant to come out in\nsympathy: Years of high\nunemployment had made some\nunions, especially the Engineers and\nElectricians, agree to one-union\nfactories and no-strike deals with new\ninvestors. All the print workers in the\nWapping plant came from the\nEETPU, the electricians' union. They\nwere well paid and had no wish to be\nre-supplanted by the very people they\nhad just replaced. They could still\nhave throttled the Wapping plant by\npicketing, but the new Trade Union\nLaws forbade a picket to deny access\nforcibly to a place of work. The plant\nwas mass picketed anyway on several\noccasions, but it only led to pitched\nbattles with the police which only led\nto bad publicity while achieving\nnothing.' As for trying to prevent\ndistribution, not only were the\ndistribution workers very reluctant to\n'black' Murdoch's newspapers, but\nMurdoch had also bypassed them with\nan alternative distribution system\nusing a road haulage firm, TNT,\ninstead of the traditional railways.\nSince they had all been sacked\nrather than made redundant, Murdoch\ndid not have to offer the workers any\ncompensation or redundancy money.\nBut as soon as it became apparent that\nhe held all the cards, he began making\nthe unions offers to settle the dispute,\nsince the bad publicity was not solely\nconfined to the unions, the riots going\non outside the plant were beginning\nto tell on the workers inside, and the\nsecurity costs of keeping the pickets\nout were running very high.\nHowever, all his offers were rejected\nby the unions because they wanted at\nleast some of the sacked to be\nreinstated and recognition at the new\nplant. Murdoch refused to give either.\nHe was interested only in redundancy\npayments. The deadlock continued\nwith Murdoch gradually raising the\nvalue of his offers (at one time he\neven offered to give the unions the old\nTimes print works in Grays' Inn Road,\nfor them to print a labour orientated\nnewspaper, but this was refused).\nEventually, the union leaders became\nconvinced that the struggle was\nhopeless, and recommended one of\nthe offers to their membership. The\nrank and file turned it down with an\noverwhelming majority in a secret\nballot. This happened several times\nuntil in January this year, with their\nvery existence threatened by\ninjunctions and sequestrations, Sogat\nand the NGA settled the dispute\nwithout a ballot.\nWhy had the dispute begun in the\nfirst place and why had Rupert\nMurdoch used such ruthless means to\nsolve it? The unions had been using\ntheir power in the 60s and 70s to win\nbetter conditions for themselves. The\nworkforce had become more and\nmore union is ed. Strict demarcation\nlines were drawn and different\nsections of the workforce were run by\ndifferent unions. Nobody was allowed\nto do another's job. If one small\nsection of the workforce went on\nstrike, a whole newspaper could grind\nto a halt. This led to great economic\ninefficiency. Furthermore, great\nadvances were being made in the\ntechnology of printing newspapers,\nbut no British newspaper owner could\nin tall any new machinery because it\nmeant shedding jobs, which the\nunions would not allow. As a result,\nby the 80s, British newspapers were\nusing 19th century technology and\nwere chronically over staffed compared with those overseas. Rupert\nMurdoch owned a large international\nmedia empire of which British papers\nwere only a part. He was having\nfinancial trouble in America getting\na new venture off the go und and\nneeded a lot of extra money. The\nobvious place to make large savings\nwas in Britain, where his newspapers\nwere very inefficient. He needed the\nmoney quickly, so he issued an\nultimatum requiring large reductions\nin the workforce. The unions, who\nstill believed in their own strength,\nroared with laughter and were sacked.\nWapping deeply shocked the\nLabour movement. It resurrected the\nspectre of that which they had spent\nthe whole century trying to fight: The\nruthless and unscrupulous employer\nwho made life so miserable for the\nmasses in the nineteenth century. But\ntheir unreserved support for the\nsacked print workers laid them open\nto accusations of attacking the police\nand undermining law and order. And\ntheir condemnation of the trade union\nlaws led to a conflict of loyalties\nbetween democracy (in the form of\npre-strike ballots) and many of the\nunions, which were against them.\nBitter divisions opened in the TUC\nbetween the Electricians, who had run\nthe Wapping plant, and the print\nunions. While everyone must have\nknown that someday Fleet Street\ninefficiency had to end, the way in\nwhich it did aroused all their most\ndeep-seated fears and misgivings.\nThe Tories, particularly the right-wing, received the whole affair with\nthinly disguised glee, and could\nbarely abstain from their gloating\nenough to make long faces for the\nviolence that went on outside the\nprint works. To many of them it was\nrevenge for the years of what they\nsaw as union blackmail.\nWapping has changed Fleet Street\nfor good. The other owners reacted\nto it with extreme hypocrisy:\nCondemning Murdoch for his\nruthlessness while using his example\nas a threat to make the unions accede\nto thousands of redundancies. Some\npapers have followed Murdoch out of\nFleet Street, nearly all are introducing\nnew equipment. Thanks to Eddy\nShah, who had a similar, if smaller\nexperience to Wapping in Stockport,\nand who launched a new newspaper\n'Today' using new technology, Fleet\nStreet will never be the same again.\nWapping has affected industrial\nrelations not only in Fleet Street, but\nnationally also. For better or for\nworse with the Miners' strike of\n1984-85, it has fulfilled the Tories'\ndream of severely curtailing union\npower.\n\n"

    "content": "Letters FELIX, Wednesday March 18th19874 Cwis wit es Dear David,\nI must reply to Ian Howgate's 'Press Release' in FELIX 767, and\ngive the point of view of those\ninvolved in the abstentions\n'campaign'\u2014something that was\nnoticeably lacking in the last issue.\nThe abstention 'campaign', by the\nway was only started after it appeared\nthat the self confessed joke candidate,\nBill Goodwin, had a reasonable\nchance of winning. We took it to a UGM (the sovereign body of the\nUnion) which backed us in believing\nin the right to abstain and the\nnecessity for publishing it.\nWhat of the campaign itself? On the\nscale of election campaigns, it was\ntiny. No knocking on doors, no\nleaflets, no harassment of the\nelectorate, just a couple of badges and\na handful of posters. I am surprised\nthat Ian blames this for the large\nnumber of abstentions he found. The\nfirst papers were put up on Thursday\nevening, following the UGM. Ian\nrealised that abstentions might win the\nfollowing weekend, after the poster\nhad only been up for one day. A successful campaign indeed. Perhaps\na more likely reason for the number\nof abstentions would be the almost\ncomplete lack of a campaign by either\nof the candidates. They didn't even\nbother to produce a handout (although\nIan did produce a large number of\ncopies of his 'Press Release' giving\nhis reasons for pulling out). It is rather\narrogant to suggest that students\nshould vote for you, if all they know\nabout you is a short speech to a UGM.\nIt was this complacency that lead to\nthe abstentions, the abstain campaign\nonly put the views of a large number\nof students into words. The candidates\nhave only themselves to blame. Ian\nmight have his own reasons for\nstanding down, but looking for\nscapegoats fools no one\nFinally, it is rather pre sump tio us for Ian to assume the students do not\nrealise the consequences of\nabstaining. If this is so they were\nequally not aware of the consequences\nof electing someone. Students are\nrather less naive than he supposes,\nand it is insulting for him to suggest\nthat we do not understand what we are\nvoting for if Ian had taken the\ncampaign as seriously as he took his\nwithdrawal, we might all be better\noff.\nYours in reply,\nChris Martin, Doc PG.\nOpen door\nDear Editor,\nWith reference to the letter in\nFELIX, Wednesday 11th March\n1987, if the \"group of civil\nengineering students\" wish to discuss\nany gre i vance concerning the\nDepartment, my door is always open.\nYours faithfully,\nPatrick J Dowling, Head of\nDepartment of Civil Engineering.\nLook at me!\nI'm the\nPresident!\nDear Dave,\nI'd like to comment on FELIX's recent coverage of elections and\nhustings. We all know how apathetic\nIC is about things political but using\nheadlines like \"Boring Elections\"\nand \"More Boring Elections\" would\nseem to encourage the apathy.\nCertainly the coverage was unduly\ncynical.\nThe turnout for the RCS elections\nmay have been poor but 250 people\nbothered to vote. How many will do\nso again after reading the derisory\ncoverage in FELIX? The elections\nand hustings were almost portrayed\nas a standing joke.\nThe piece on the RCS election\nresults wasn't even factually correct\n(Fiona Nicholas is Life Sci not\nPhysics). Union elections are news\nstories and deserve to be covered as\nsuch\u2014accurately and without bias.\nClare McErlane,\nRCS President Elect\nSERVICING & REPAIRS\nat\nRICKY' S GARAGE75% discount on labour for IC\nstudents and staff\n(Personal service guaranteed)\n19 QUEENS GATE PLACE\nMEWS\nSOUTH KENSINGTON\nLONDON S.W.7 Tel: 01 581 1589\nUnfortunately we are unable to publish the letter\nsigned \"One of the few\" as the writer's name was\nnot supplied. We can with old names if requested to\ndo so: The writer should contact David Jones in\nthe FELIX office (3515), or Robert Daniel via the\nUnion office.\nElection Blues\nIan Howgate's decision to withdraw\nfrom the election for ICU President\nhas got to be one of the most childish\nacts by any sabbatical candidate. No\ndoubt he feels that the meagre abstain\ncampaign was directed at him\npersonally; he is quite right to think\nso. The students who advocated\nabstention had been very unimpressed\nby his histrionic performances at ICU\nCouncil. Though none of them were\nprepared to oppose him, it was\ngrossly arrogant of Ian to opt out of\nserious campaigning in the way that\nhe did. I agree it is difficult to\napproach elections in a positive\nmanner when there is only a half-serious candidate standing against\nyou, but this is no excuse for\ndegrading the election procedure by\nadopting a half-serious approach\nyourself. It was this action which\nprecipitated the abstain campaign.\nIan's argument that neither he nor Bill\nGoodwin would be in a position to run\nagain after a 'victory' for abstentions\njust doesn't wash; he is in a far less\ncredible position to stand a second\ntime after pulling out once, much in\nthe same impulsive manner as he is\ngiven to storming out of Council. The\nonus is always on the candidate to\nprove his or her worth. The\nemergence of a( limited) abstain\ncampaign should not affect this.\ninconvenienced by the College\ntightening its belt. Without a new Hall\nof Residence it will be impossible to\ntake another 100 students and\nmaintain the guarantee of a place in\nHall to all first year undergraduates.\nIC cannot afford to drain more\nresources away from teaching. UGC\ncuts and the Government's education\npolicies have already contrived to\nover emphasise the value of research\nwork. If this trend is allowed to\ncontinue, the College Governers can\nexpect to read far more FELIX letters\nlike the one which caused such\nconcern last week.\nNote on letters page\nThe talks by Messrs Howe and\nSinclair were not covered because I forgot about them (again). Cecil\nParkinson's address was not covered\nbecause he said nothing of any\nsignificance.\nEarlier this term FELIX was\nattacked for giving too many column\ninches to Leon Brittan and Peter\nGoosen of the South African\nEmbassy. Our policy is to cover as\nmuch news as we can as accurately\nas possible. If there are any more self-righteous bigots who are thinking of\nwriting in they can save themselves\nthe trouble; I have no interest in this\nsort of correspondence.\nAnd now for the good news Credits\nLast Friday Governing Body\nannounced a cut of 100 jobs, to be\nspread across all areas of staffing.\nWhere this is to mean a drop in the\nnumber of academic staff (and it is a possibility that this will be where\nmajor reductions are made) the policy\nwill be to transfer staff to research\ncontracts, and take them off the\npayroll. Hence there will be more\nstaff engaged solely in research work,\nand fewer teaching students.\nAt the same time Governing Body\nhave \"noted' the College policy to\nincrease the number of overseas\nstudents by an additional 100 in\nOctober 1988. This is on top of\nincreases which were already\nplanned. The general attitude at\nGoverning Body was that \"it has to\nbe done,\" which, I suppose, is a practical view.

    "content": "The Newspaper Of Imperial College Union Founded 1949\nAcademics fry as\nGovernors cook books\nOne hundred jobs are to be lost at Imperial College, it was\nrevealed at Governing Body on Friday. The staff cuts are being\nintroduced as part of a plan to counteract an estimated debt\nof \u00a3 3 million by 1988. The College is also aiming to attract an\nextra 100 overseas students, in addition to the increases already\nplanned, in order to offset the debt.\nFinancial problems have arisen the country, he added.\nbecause of a new pay deal for\nacademic staff, a shortfall in the\ntarget ted recruitment of overseas\nstudents, and a low grant from the\nUniversity Grants Committee. A paper put to Governing Body by the\nchairman, Sir Henry Fisher, proposed\nthree areas in which money should be\nsaved or raised. As well as staff\nreductions and an increase in overseas\nstudents, it was suggested that the\nterms on which research contracts are\ncarried out be altered.\nThe first proposal was to reduce the\nnumber of all types of staff by a total\nof 100, which, it is estimated, should\nsave \u00a32 million. Some staff would be\nremoved from the College payroll, to\nbe funded by research grants. The rest\nof the reduction would be achieved by\nvoluntary redundancies and voluntary\nearly retirements, by freezing\nvacancies and, as a last resort, by\ncompulsory redundancies.\nCommenting on this suggestion,\nJohn Fecamp of the ASTMS said that\nstaff cuts would be opposed if they\nwere caused by College having to\nfund pay rises. Technical staff are not\nrepresented on the Governing Body,\nand they are subject to a non-replacement policy, where staff who\nleave are only replaced if their post\ncan be.demonstrated to be important\nfor teaching or scientific work. Mr\nFecamp explained that during a similar series of staff cuts some years\nago, College gave ASTMS an\nassurance that compulsory\nredundancies would be avoided if at\nall possible. Any move to introduce\nsuch redundancies would bring the\nCollege into dispute with the\nmembership of ASTMS throughout\nThe Rector, Prof Eric Ash, said\nthat the 5% staff 'cuts' would not be\nstructured and would not be\nimplemented immediately. He added\nthat he had 'no worry' about the staff\nwhich remained being able to keep up\nthe present level of teaching. He\ndefended the proposal to increase the\nnumber of overseas students,\nexplaining that the College is at\npresent below its target level for both\noverseas and other, low-fee-paying\nstudents. When asked about the\navailability of accommodation for\nthese extra students, Prof Ash said\nth j at he was sure there would be\nenough places for first year\nundergraduates to be guaranteed a year in. The guarantee to first year\noverseas postgraduates might have to\nbe ended, he added.\nStudent Accommodation Officer\nLesley Gillingham told FELIX that\nshe had only found out about the\nproposal after Monday's ICU council\nmeeting, at which the paper was\ndiscussed. She that said she was sure\nth st all the new undergraduates could\nbe given places in student\naccommodation if the new buildings\nin Evelyn Gardens were acquired.\nThis would probably mean that no\nhome postgraduates could be given\nplaces, she added.\nThe planned increase in overseas\nstudent numbers was severely\ncriticised by ICU Council, and\nmembers suggested that College had\nnot considered the implications of\nsuch action. Concern was expressed\nover overseas students' welfare,\naccommodation and overcrowding in\ndepartments. ICU Hon Sec Dave\nColley later described College's attitude as 'mercenary'.\nIC beat the Blues\nImperial College's Boat Club First Eight beat Oxford's boat race crew to win the \"Mackintosh\nTrophy\" on March 7th.

The result\nmade IC overnight leaders with the\nevening's other two matches,\nBirmingham vs Liverpool and\nLiverpool vs Bristol ending in draws.\nIC's first game on Saturday, against\nour arch-rivals Bristol, was closely\nfought as expected. For 3 Vi quarters\nthere was nothing to choose between\nthe sides at 5-5, but with about 2\nminutes left Bristol edged ahead.\nThey added another in the closing\nseconds as IC threw everything\nforward in an attempt to equalise.\nIC's next game against Liverpool\nwas another hard fought contest with\nneither side giving anything away.\nHowever, a loss of concentration in\nthe 3rd quarter saw IC slip from 5-4\nup to 10-5 down. A spirited fight back in the 4th quarter ensued but with time\non their side Liverpool finished 11-8\nwinners.\nAs IC entered the last game of the\ntournament, against Birmingham, we\nknew we could only finish 4th.

The first game\nwas between RSM and RCS. RSM\nfinished the first half leading by only\n1-0 despite much pressure. The\nsecond half was very hard fought, the\nfinal score being a22 draw. The next\ngame between RSM and C&G saw\na relatively uneventful first half but\nwithin 30 seconds of the second half\nRSM had taken the lead thanks to\nMark Rayfield. This was to set the\ntempo of the rest of the game, the\nfinal score being 4-3 to RSM.\nThis left RCS with the task of\nbeating C&G by two goals to be sure\nof winning the cup. They began well,\ntaking a20 lead fairly early on\nagainst a slightly tired looking C&G. However, C&G did not give up\nby any means but battled back to draw\nthe game 2-2, their second goal\ncoming from a short corner within\nseconds of the final whistle. As a result RSM retained the Stephenson's Cup for the second year, thus\nrounding off a very successful season\nin which they also beat Camborne and\nalmost certainly gained promotion\ninto the ULU first division.\nAlasdair Martin, RSM Club Capt.\nSocSoc\nWe are still active and have two\nspeakers coming up soon:\nApril 29th \u2014Austin Mitchell MP.\nHe is a former broadcaster and\nLabour MP for Great Grimsby.\nMay 5th \u2014Denzil Davies MP.

A motion passed at the Results UGM requires the Exec to allow any AIDS patient or carrier equal access to Union\nand College facilities. In addition, the\nExec will be writing to the College\nauthorities and the Health Centre, requesting statements on the official\nposition*on the AIDS issue.\nMost sections of the motion, proposed by Robert Daniel, were passed without opposition. There was\nsome discussion on the sections\nrelating to policy on access to sporting facilities. Guilds President-elect\nDave Tyler pointed out that the Rugby\nFootball Union had banned carriers\nfrom taking part in that sport. An\namendment, proposed by Guy Perry,\nlimited the 'equal access' policy to\nthose sports where the ruling body\nhad not issued a directive to the con-tr ary, and this section was passed in\nthis form. The only section of the motion not to be carried denied the right\nof employers to demand that any person take an HIV test. This section was\ndefeated on the vote. Quorum was\nthen called.\nRerun\nThe election for ICU President will\nhave to be rerun. Bill Goodwin, the\nonly candidate standing for the post\nfollowing the sudden withdrawal of\nIan Howgate, decided not to appeal\nagainst Election Committee's decision\nto invalidate the election. ICU Hon\nSec Dave Colley gave a report in his\ncapacity as Returning Officer at last\nThursday's results UGM. He explained that he had permitted Messrs\nGoodwin and Howgate to use their\n'joint' posters when they had been\npresented to him already printed. His\noriginal decision had been not to\nallow them. When the matter was\ndiscussed at Elections Committee it\nwas decided to follow the written\nrules as clearly as possible and Mr\nColley's ruling was overturned.\nNext year's non-sabbatical Union\nOfficers were also elected at the\nResults UGM. As none of the elections were contested, each of the\nfollowing were returned unopposed:\nAdrian Johnson (Internal Services Officer), John Noble (Entertainmments\nOfficer), Alistair Seymour (UGM\nChairman), Lindsey Wishart\n(Women's Officer), Neil Motteram\n(External Affairs Officer), Pippa\nSalmon (Welfare Officer) and Nigel\nBaker (Rag Chairman).\nZeebrugge\nMembers of the Chem Eng\ndepartment organised a raffle and\ncake sale for the Zeebrugge ferry\ndisaster appeal last Monday.

The\nman approached a Chinese student\nwho realised his real identity and attempted to set a trap. On being asked\nfor \u00a31000 the student said that he had\nno money with him, but arranged to\nmeet the man at 5pm in front of the\nRoyal School of Mines. He then\nalerted the police who rushed to the\nscene, but arrived a few minutes too\nlate to apprehend the man. Police are\nnow trying to trace the owner of the\ncar, a Fiat Uno, which the man was\ndriving.\nThe con man is still using the same\nstory to get foreign students to part\nwith money. He claims to be a French\nairline steward and always asks for a substantial sum, offering a fake gold\nwatch as surety. Anyone who is approached by this man should contact\nCollege security immediately on\n3370.\nPot-bellied\nMonday's IC Union Council meeting\nvoted to 'award' a flower pot to the\nholder of the post of Haldane Library\nRecord Buyer, currently held by\nAdrian 'Jelly' Johnson, The motion,\nproposed by Pete Wilson and Mr.\nJohnson, originally sought to award\na pot for the Record Buyer to sit\nbehind the Union Bar, but was\namended by Alan Pose to the final\nform.

    "content": "Featura FELIX, Wednesday March 18th19878 It was during the 1950's that the term\nThird World was first coined. A Chinese Foreign Minister observed\nthat the world had become divided\ninto three clear areas, the First World,\nthat of the superpowers, the Second\nWorld, that of the industrialised\nNorthern nations, and the Third\nWorld, that of the post colonial,\nunderdeveloped nations. In more\nrecent years it has become fashionable\nto consider the divide as being purely\nbetween Northern countries, where\n\"Western Civillisation\" was born,\nand the Southern nations, which\nindustrialisation had passed by.\nExamination of precisely where the\nmore modern industrialised nations\nfall geographically, shows the divide\nto be less clear. Exceptions to the idea\nof a strict North-South divide are\nmanifest in the area around the Pacific\nBasin, and the Middle East. Efforts\nat lumping nations together because\nof their geographical location are\nprobably too simplistic, and it might\nbe better to consider the problem of\nWorld poverty in a less divisive\nmanner. Even the initial premiss, that\ncome about without full cooperation,\nand dramatic alterations in the attitude\nof the Northern states. The\nindustrialised nations, it decided,\nmust aid the situation by \"helping the\ndeveloping countries to pay their own\nway.\" The increased interdependence\nof the North and South meant that\neconomic reform on the part of the\nNorth would ensure its own future\neconomic prosperity.\nThe Commission questioned the\ndesirability of maintaining high rates\nof economic growth in the developing\nnations at the ex sp ense of exhaustible\nnatural resources, and also to the\nde tre ment of the environment. The\nterrible inroads into our finite areas\nof rainforest came about as a direct\nresult of developing nations stripping\na resource which would bring in\nvaluable income. The morality of\nNorthern ponti fi cation about such a situation could not be justified unless\nthey provided suggestions as to\nalternatives. Nor could it be justified,\nwhen it was industrial demand in the\nNorth which provided the markets for\nsuch raw materials.\nbroke in 1973 dealt a heavy blow to\nhopes for economic enlightenment in\nthe North. The irony of the oil crisis\nwas that although the non-industrialised oil producing countries\nof the Organisation of Petrolium\nExporting Countries were key in\ncausing the crisis, the economic\nbacklash struck the other non-industrialised countries just as hard as\nit hit the North.\nThe poorer nations of the world can\nonly realise their economic potential\nif they are assisted by the North in\nbecoming producers of goods, rather\nthan mere exporters of raw materials.\nAs they become increasingly\nprosperous, openings will increase for\ntrade between the developed and\ndeveloping nations. There could be a period when the North would be\ncontributing more than it received in\nthe way of new markets, but\neventually, the Third World would\nbecome sufficiently prosperous that\nmutually benefit i al trade would be\npossible.\nThe massive debt which developing\ncountries have amassed in their quest\nfinance for the developing nations is\nlikely to dry up, and a large part of\nthe North's banking system is going\nto collapse with it.\nThe major draw back with much of\nthe current lending to the Third World\nis that the greater part of it is devoted\nto investment in programmes which\ndo not produce financial rewards in\nthe time allowed to pay off the debt.\nThe Commission urged greater direct\ninjection of finance into Third World\neconomies. This would have to be\ncarefully monitored, as in order to\n.produce satisfactory social\nimprovement, such a flow of cash\nmust be directed towards\ninfrastructure investment. Much of\nthe wealth obtained by the oil rich\nstates was observed by the\nCommission to have passed out of the\nreach of the majority of the people in\nthose countries, and had little impact\non their standard of living.\nThe fate of the very poorest nations\non earth was singled out as deserving\nspecial and unique attention. For\nmany of these nations, their plight is\nnot just one of poor economy, but one\n-SOUTH David Burns The plight of developing nations the World is comprised of three\ngroups of nations, has become\noutdated, with the advent of emerging\nindustrialisation in many areas.\nContinuing poverty, famine,\nnational debt and war throughout the\nglobe have spurred on the formation\nof numerous organisations, the\nwriting of a multiplicity of reports,\nand massive aid campaigns over the\npast thirty years. Still, many nations\nremain grossly underdeveloped, and\nde spar at ely poor.\nIn 1980, one of the most wide\nranging and const ruc ive reports for\nmany years was produced by the\nIndependent Commission on\nInternational Development Issues,\nunder the chairmanship of Willy\nBrandt. With opinion from all sides\nof the problem, the lamentable\nexception being the Soviet Bloc, their\n\"Programme For Survival\" forms\nthe most objective examination of all\naspects of World development ever\nattempted.\nThe fact that the underdeveloped\nnations are dependent on the\nindustrialised nations in economic and\nmaterial terms is of great concern to\nthe Commission. Over 90% of the\nworld's manufacturing industry is\nbased in the North, and although the\nThird World has a strangle hold on\nraw materials, it relies on Northern\ntechnology to extract them. It can be\nseen, and was concluded by the\nCommission, that improvement in the\nsituation of the Third World cannot\nThe Third World has therefore\nbeen at pains to negotiate more just\neconomic trade agreements, the\nGeneral Agreement on Trade and\nTariffs being apart icu a lar target for\nreform. The modest recession of the\nearly seventies meant that the North\nwas less susceptible to the South's demands for fairer international trade\nagreements, which they viewed as\ndetrimental to their shaky economies.\nIt has always been a problem that the\nNorth is unwilling to make economic\nconcessions at times when it is\nsuffering from its own monetary\ntroubles, and the Oil Crisis which\nfor rapid economic development is\nalso a cause for great concern. Nearly\n40% of the developing countries' debt\nis carried by the private banking\nmarkets of the North. Spiralling\nrepayments have crippled many\npoorer nations' economic growth.\nLoans are then taken out to service\nloans which are due for repayment.\nThe whole uncertain business of\nborrowing and repayment is just\nholding together, and the newly\nindustrialised nations are barely\nmanaging to hold their heads above\nwater. However, if the unsteady\naccumulation of debt collapses,\nof a harsh climate and deteriorating\necosystem which threatens to make\ntheir lands incapable of supporting the\npopulation. Major programmes of\nreforestation, soil management,\nenergy and mineral development,\ncommunications and improved health\nfacilities were all recommended.\nThere can be no question of these\nnations being able to support this type\nof move on their own, and\ninternational cooperation in the North\nto a levi ate the crisis is the only\npossible course of action.\nIn all efforts to promote\ndevelopment in what is, rightly or\nwrongly, termed the Third World,\nnational differences are encountered\nwhich impede the process. The very\nfact that many developing countries\nalready devote huge sums to\narmaments to fight their neighbouring\nstates, hinders their development. It\nis the North which supplies those\narms, although disturbingly, the\nemerging nations are nurturing their\nown arms industries to produce more\nfinance. The light may dawn on both\nsuperpower blocs, and the arms\nsupply from the North dry up, but\ncould we then justify intervention to\nprevent the spread of Third World\narms? It is just another illustration that\nit is not only the North which has to\ncome to its senses in the effort to\nproduce a decent world for all. The\n\"Programme For Survival\" will be\na global effort, if we are all to\nsurvive.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FELIX, Wednesday March 18th1987 If a complete story of this year's sabbatical election campaigns were to\nbe written it would have to start some\ntime around the mid 1960s. All this\nyear's candidates were mere babes at\nthe time, and all were quite clearly\ndropped on their head before their\nskull had a chance to harden,\notherwise they would have gone out\nand got a proper job instead of\npon c ing around at Imperial for\nanother year.\nHowever this account will confine\nitself to the more recent events. It is\nnow 1986, and the unfortunate\nchildren mentioned above have done\na reasonable impression of growing\nup and are now bickering their way\nthrough numerous committees at IC\nUnion\u2014not realising that these\nrevered institutions were set up to\nkeep them out of the way of real\nstudents. Some attempt to make a name for themselves by proposing\nsilly motions that the Chair stuff a pair\nof the president's socks up his nose\n(they're just so wacky these\nstudents!). Others threaten to storm\nout if anyone disagrees with them\u2014\nthis rather backfires if no one cares\nabout their departure.\nAutumn is here, and already Ian\nHowgate is making a huge effort to\nget his name into print. He has failed\ndismally in the storming out battle by\ncharging off into the wilderness at the\nSilwood council meeting before\nrealising he's30 miles from anywhere\nwith no way to get home till it\nfinishes! He's also writing long and\nboring letters complaining that the\nFELIX news staff are out to get him.\nHis principal target is professional\ndrop-out Mark Cottle. As paranoia is\none of the first characteristics of a sabbatical this appears a good move.\nAs this term commenced more\ncandidates started appearing. Alan\nRose (who is to Imperial College\nwhat...err...Alan Rose is to Imperial\nCollege) began to drool at the mention\nof a ballot paper. Meanwhile at\nFELIX, Chris Edwards (the man who\ngave art a bad name) was trying to\ntake on every piece of artwork in\ncollege. Judith Hackney also seemed\neager, and Grenville Manuel was\ntaking elocution lessons in an attempt\nto lose his phoney \"working class\"\naccent. No one showed much interest\nin becoming Deputy President or Hon\nSec, thus proving that three years of\nacademic work at Imperial doesn't send everybody crazy after all.\nThen the election papers went up.\nThe starting gun...they're off Alan\nRose immediately put his name up for\nDeputy President, for no particularly\nvalid reason\u2014maybe he was standing\nas a joke candidate. If so the joke\nprobably doesn't look so funny now\nthat he's been elected unopposed.\nTalking of joke candidates going\nsour, the first person to throw a hat\ninto the ring for the job of Chief Pratt\n(ie President) was Bill Goodwin, of\nMech Eng 2. With the backing of the\nmighty QT Soc joke machine behind\nhim he stood on a 'Charlie Chaplin'\nplatform. Ian Howgate also signed up,\nstanding on any platform he could\nfind. In addition someone from\nHolland who just happened to be\npassing through the building put his\nname up for Deputy President, and\nwas promptly disqualified by Dave\nColley, who as Returning Officer had\nstarted on a moral crusade to see that\nthe torch of democracy burned bright\nat Imperial.\nChas Jackson and Symon Corns\ndecided to run for Hon Sec, despite\nthe fact that both knew that the post\ncould be done by someone with the\nintelligence of an electric toothbrush.\nMiss Hackney and Mr Edwards put\ntheir names up for FELIX Editor. The\nFELIX election was target ted for\nparticular attention by the Rev Dave\nColley because both the candidates\nhad romantic links with people\ncontrolling the student media. Judith\nHackney was romantically linked\nwith Dave Jones, this year's FELIX\nEditor, and Chris Edwards was\ndeeply involved with someone who\nwas running Graffitti Club (himself).\nAs the papers were taken down the\ncampaigning started. Bill Goodwin's posters consisted of the words 'Vote\nfor Bill' in letters 2mm high on an A3\nsheet, obviously unaware that the last\ntime subtlety achieved results in\nImperial College was 1932. Chris\nEdwards had huge flashy posters\nwhich had been silk screened, but a silk screen is no substitute for\nimagination. The bookshop started to\nsell hundreds of black marker pens as\nbeards, pipes, moustaches and\nobscene speech bubbles began to\nappear faster than willies at a bar night. Symon Corns revealed his true\nstrategy by producing only two\nposters, both of which were put up\nin the Guilds Union Office.\nThe next event was the Hustings\nUGM, where all the candidates get a chance to force their unrealistic\npolicies down the throats of the great\nmasses. However the great masses\ndecided that enough was enough, and\ndecided not to attend.\nThe meeting therefore took place in\nfront of a dismal crowd, with the Rev\nDave Colley getting all upset because\nsome candidates were getting hit by\npaper darts more often than others.\nArch-fu nster Mark Cottle proposed a motion saying that an abstain\ncampaign be allowed, which Howgate\nassociate Dave Lowrie objected to.\nWhen the meeting had shown that it\nthought a 'campaign' should be\nallowed (obviously less than\nenthralled about the candidates on\nshow) Dave Lowrie tried to end the\nmeeting before the speeches had even\nstarted. However a little imagination\nby those in control kept the show on\nthe road, and Lowrie adopted the\nusual Howgate rear guard tactic\n(storming out to sulk).\nThe speeches were less than\nenthralling. Bill Goodwin managed to\nrescue a damsel in distress who had\nbeen carried away by an evil villain,\nwhile Ian Howgate scored maximum\npoints on the s no rome ter and no one\ngot carried anywhere. Alan Rose,\nunopposed DP, stood up and managed\nto give everybody a lecture on how\namazing and wonderful he was which\ngave everyone a good laugh until they\nrealised that he really meant it.\nThe hustings for Hon Sec were less\neventful, as both Chas Jackson and\nSymon Corns were serious candidates\nwho wanted to do the job. The same\nj was true with the speeches for FELIX\nEditor, although some of the claims\nmade by one candidate must have\nbeen less than serious. Even the\ndozing audience were sus sed enough\nto figure that claiming you single\nhandedly do everything on the paper,\nand then claiming it will be better\nwhen you take over and do\neverything, is pushing it a bit!\nThe next piece of excitement was\nthe Presidential campaign, where Bill\nGoodwin and Ian Howgate started to\nrun each others' campaigns. Having\nbeen rather left out of the fun so far\nnutty anarchist and 'Grensheet' editor\nGrenville Manuel decided to object on\nthe basis that this threatened his claim\nto the title of \"college's wackiest\nman\". Meanwhile Rev. Colley was\nengaging in some anarchy of his own\nby inventing rules to allow joke\npublicity and then getting his\ncommittee to overturn them. This\nparticularly annoyed poor innocent\nBill who had spent lots of money\ntrying to be a complete joke only to\nbe taken completely seriously!\nIt now became clear that the real\ncontest was between Messrs Colley\nand Goodwin to see who could be\nmost irrational. Mr. Colley insisted\nthat only he knew the spirit of the\nrules while everyone else insisted this\nsounded like dictatorship. Mr.\nGoodwin struck back by telling\npeople on an alternate basis that he\nwas,\n1) A joke candidate put up by QT Soc\n2) A serious candidate put up by\nCharlie Chaplin.\n3) A joke candidate put up by Ian\nHowgate.\n4) A serious joke who was putting up\nwith Ian Howgate.\n5) Next year's president.\n6) This year's president.\n7) Ian Howgate.\n8) ...that's enough serious jokes-Ed.\nMiffed by the fact that he was\ncoming last in everything Ian stormed\nout and in doing so produced his only\neffective propaganda of the entire\ncampaign. Then everyone who'd been\ntaking things as a joke took them\nseriously and everyone who'd been\ntaking things seriously declared it was\nall a joke. The election committee\ndecided it was a farce (which most of\nthe voters had realised from the\nbeginning) and invalidated the\nelection.\nNo one seemed too upset by the\nresults of the valid elections.\nMeanwhile the defeated crept off to\nbe consoled by their friends and\nAccomodation Officer and union hack\ncounsellor Lesley Gillingham. So\nnow we can look forward to a re-run\nand the chance to see the same bunch\nof professional egotists appearing\nsoon on walls and leaflets\neverywhere\u2014it really isn't so\ndifferent from all those old silent\nslapstick films they put on TV when\nthere's nothing else to fill the gaps!\n\n"
