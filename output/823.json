    "content": "Feature\nKeep the Cat Free!\nThe FELIX Club, founded in 1975, was established to encourage fellowship\nbetween the past and present members of FELIX, and to act as a source\nof support for the newspaper. The Club has its origins in the campaigns\nfought against particular attacks by the Union on the freedom of the paper\nin the three years prior to its formation. The battles between FELIX and\nthe Union were 'dirty, ruthless, underhand and bloody'.\nIn the following article, Mike Llewellyn-Williams, FELIX Editor 1974-75,\nrecounts the developments which led to the clubs formation.\nOrigins of the Club\nThe origins of the FELIX Club, or\nrather the origins of the developments\nwhich led to the conception of such\na club, can be traced to the\nbeginning of the academic session\n1974-75. It was a period of\ninexorable change in many ways,\nnot least of all being the way in\nwhich FELIX was physically\nproduced. The key event was the\nchange from contract letterpress to\noffset-litho print production\nin-house.\nPrior to this time, the newspaper\nClashes between the\nEditor of FELIX and\nthe President of the\nUnion are nothing\nnew\nhad for several years been printed\noutside the College, which meant in\nterms of production, that no\npasting-up, folding or collating was\nnecessary. The Editors simply had\nto send all the copy together with\nrough page lay-out designs to the\nprinters and they would do the rest.\nEditorial staff, in terms of numbers,\nwas minimal and largely ad hoc;\nproduction staff was . effectively\nzero.\nEarly in 1974, with printing costs\nescalating dramatically, the Union\nagreed with the College that an\noffset-litho printing unit plus five\nyears' supply of paper would be\npurchased using College funds and\nhoused in the then Union executives\nsuite of offices until such a time as\nthe College had sufficient space to\nabsorb it next to its own printing\nunit. The agreement also entailed\nrecruitment of two professional staff\n(to be paid for out of Union finances)\nand re housing the Union Office in\nits current location (the old TV\nroom).\nIt was further understood that the\nprimary purpose of the new unit\nwas the production of FELIX\n(without any prejudice to the\nCollege's printing needs; it was,\nafter all, the College's machinery).\nNow with the Editor suddenly\nfaced with the unprecedented\nprospect of organising the complete\nproduction schedule from start to\nfinish as well as the more usual\nreporting, writing and editing, the\ndrama started. In the first instance,\nthe catastrophic rupture of the\nhitherto generally accepted work\nroutine of the Editor (which was\nexacerbated by continual print-mach in cy breakdowns) went\nlargely unnoticed.\nWhich meant that when FELIX\nwas unable in the first instance to\ncrack the enormous production\nproblems encountered and as a result could not immediately\nmaintain continuity in terms of\ncontent and 'up-to-the-minute'-ness, the newspaper was showered\nwith criticisms which displayed total\nignorance and complete lack of\nunderstanding of the new problems\ncreated by the new printing process.\nCountless editorial explanations\nwent largely unheeded and nothing\nThe FELIX staff had\ndeveloped into a closely knit group of\npartisans, united in\ntheir opposition to\nUnion intervention\nbut hard slog, often working\nthrough the night, was keeping\nFELIX on the rails.\nEnter key factor number two\nThe President and Hon Sec of the\nUnion during 1974-75, in a coma of\ndizzy-heights grandeur, held the\nview that the entire Union\nmembership should adopt a coherent, single-minded posture\nsa.\".,sr r Mon\ne On\nWeeks\ni \u00ab SS St\n\u2022 \u00bb iJ** H \u00ab \u00a3 * \u00b0 \" ' \u00ab \u00bb oo, \u00ab K \u00bbf com.\nsa?3rS art's' \u2022 Porter\n- \"mend men i05 OD \u00ab|\u2014\n'\u00bb \u2022 \u00bb field Vt<\" C,V\"\" be nie.

Although assured of rank-and-file support in theory, Union\nGeneral Meetings were poorly\nattended. Worse still, the Council,\nwhich held the Union's purse\nstrings, was composed of irrational\nself-seeking factions. Hardly a basis\nthen of presenting a united front to\nthe College.\nHowever, with a lot of hard work\nand persuasive acumen, the\nPresident succeeded in acting\npresidential at UGM's, wooed the\nCouncil factions to a pretence of\nunanimity and even bamboozled\nthe internecine Constituent College\nUnion Presidents into accepting the\nnotion of collective responsibility\nwithin the ICU executive. So far so\ngood.\nThe next step in the chain of\nevents was the suggestion of the\ncreation of a sabbatical Junior\nTreasurer. And since the College\nwas in no mood whatsoever to\ncreate a fourth sabbatical (the three\nexisting ones were President, Hon\nSec and FELIX Editor), this could\nonly be achieved b v taking the third\nsabbatical from FELIX and reallocating it.\nThe President's timing for such a suggestion, with FELIX under fire\nand with the enormous problems\ncreated by the new printing process\nlargely un perceived, was\nimpeccable. For all the President's men, it seemed a logical extension\nfor increasing union efficiency\nwhilst simultaneously crippling a potentially dissenting voice in the\npolitical arena. For those of us on\nthe FELIX staff, our superhuman\nefforts on the newspaper largely\nunsung, it amounted to a declaration of war.\nAnd it was indeed a council of war\nthat was called that night in the\nFELIX Office. Our retail i ation tactics\nPage 10 FELIX January 13 1989\nFeature\nwere quickly agreed, they were\nnothing i short of a strategic\nconspiracy which was to defend\nFELIX to the death if necessary!\nThe campaigning that ensued was\ndirty, ruthless, underhand and\nbloody. We were taking no\nhostages. And by sheer persuasion\nand force of argument mixed with\ncomplete. And just as war can bring\npeople together and bind them\ntogether in the heat of conflict, so\nthis 'war' produced the indomitable\nfighting spirit which can create a unanimity of purpose. It was this\nspirit which would later be\nharnessed and would lead to the\nthe occasional hyperbolic threat, we\nwon the day, in as legitimate a manner as any politician can claim\nto act in.\nIt was several conspiracies and\nThe primary purpose\nof the new unit was\nthe production of\nFELIX\none highly acrimonious council\nmeeting later that we were able to\ncheer 'Felicide averted' on the front\npage. Several more conspiracies,\none working party investigation and\nyet another highly acrimonious\ncouncil meeting, it was all over. The\nPresident and Hon Sec were\nisolated, beaten and thrashing about\nin defeat.\nThe FELIX staff got as pissed as\nrats that night. The triumph in the\nface of hostilities had been\nfoundation of the FELIX Club.\nClashes between the Editor of\nFELIX and the President of the\nUnion are nothing new. They've\nhappened several times in the past\nand perhaps one of the most\npublicised was in the session\n1963/64. It started with the President\ndisagreeing strongly with the\nsentiments of what the Editor had\nwritten in the newspaper, followed\nby stinging criticism from the Editor,\nthen outrage from the President,\nthen a rebuttal etc., etc. Fortunately\nfor us, the 'freedom of the press'\nThe FELIX staff got\npissed as rats that\nnight\nargument won the day and the\nPresident lost the face-to-face UGM\nshowdown on the subject.\nMajor acrimonious disputes of a similar- nature also occurred in\n1972/73 and 73/74 which clearly\nhighlighted the Editor's increasing\nvulnerability to interference from\nself-important Union bureaucrats.\nFor those of us on the\nFELIX staff, our\nsuperhuman efforts\non the paper largely\nunsung, it amounted\nto a declaration of war\nThe 73/74 programme of\nh arras s ment of FELIX actually\nended with the forced resignation of\nthe Editor after just one term of\noffice.\nThe 1974/75 dispute then\neffectively cyst all is ed our intention\nto reduce this perennial\nvulnerability. In the spirit of 'Let us\nprevent FELIX from being\nthreatened by the Union again', a policy of respectable entrenchment\nensued.\nOne strategy was legitimately to\nenhance FELIX's image, essentially\nto 'institutional is e' it. The crest and\nEditor's honour board evolved as a result.\nAnother tactic was to position\nFELIX not just as a recorder of\nevents, but also as a sponsor of\nevents. Thus was born the annual\nFELIX motor rally and photographic\ncompetition.\nThe final strategy concerned\nstaffing. It was agreed that ideally\nthe newspaper's staff should spring\nfrom the CCU's. And if they were\nunion officials then so much the\nbetter in terms of achieving a better\nunderstanding of FELIX's problems.\nNothing but hard\nslog, often working\nthrough the night,\nwas keeping FELIX on\nthe rails\nLastly, the idea of a staff tie was\ndeveloped. It was to be a single red\ncat on a blue background, but the\nred was changed at the last minute\nto silver/white in token of the 25th anniversary of FELIX's foundation.\nIt was shortly afterwards that the\nidea of forming a club arose.\nThe FELIX staff by now had\ndeveloped into a closely knit group\nof partisans, united in their\nopposition to Union\ninterventionism. Within that\nframework, the notion of forming a club along the lines of other IC clubs\n(an hence rekindling the spirit\nwhich was once enshrined in the old\nScriblerus Club) took root.\nThe Club was to serve several\npurposes such as: an aid to staff\nrecruitment; a source of ideas; a course of support; a vehicle by\nwhich old members could keep in\ntouch with FELIX and each other; a promoter of good fellowship\nbetween members old and new.\nFriday, the newspaper's publication day, was chosen as the\nday that the Tie had to be worn on\npain of forfeiture of a pint. The Club\n\u2022 was formally devised on an elective\nbasis and thereby assumed an\naspirational status for newcomers to\nthe FELIX staff. Past Editors were\nconsidered automatically eligible for\nmembership and the task of tracing\nthem across the globe was pursued\nwith some notable success.\nSince its formal foundation in\nOctober 1975, the Club has gone\nfrom strength to strength despite\nthe odd bout of soul-searching and\nconstitutional revision. Given the\norigins of the Club however, it's perhaps not really surprising that\nsome of the older members can\noccasionally feel defensive with\nregard to the relatively\nun encumbered autonomy of FELIX\nwhich survives today because of\ntheir own vigil en ce and\nuncompromising persistence.\nIt will be the new\nmembers who will\nhold the key to the\nfuture\nI certainly hope we all try never\nto lose sight of these 'fighting spirit'\norigins. In the final analysis though\nit will be the new men be rs who will\nhold the key to the future and it is\nto them we must look for the\nmain ten ar. ee of the institution we've\nhelped to construct.\nSo, long ma v it flourish, and Keep\nthe Cat Free!\nJanuary 13 1989 FELIX Page 11\n\n"

A bottle of whisky is not an\n'abominable thing': it is just something forbidden\nby a few religions. Moderation is a virtue, and\nin Ancient Greece, the homeland of all\nphilosophy, religious and secular, excessive ness( the rhetorical 'hyperbole') was, and still is, an\ninsult to God. It usually leads to Ayatollah\nKhomeiny types of regime! I therefore express\nmy support to the Editor, noting that if we.\nChristians, were to react with such violence, the\nwhole of the FELIX Christmas issue should have\nbeen sie zed and thereafter destroyed, whilst the\neditorial staff would be excommunicated!\nYours sincerely,\nEmmanuel Saridakis Physics 1 (Christian)\nShurley s homem ish take Dear Editor,\nCongratulations on suggesting the best present\nfor your readers this Christmas. I refer to the\nQur'an (mis-spelt Quoran) in the sack of Father\nChristmas on the front cover of the last issue of\nFelix. Since embracing Islam eight years ago, I have found the Qur'an to be the True and\nUncorrupted Word of God, the final and\ncomplete revelation for the guidance of mankind.\nThe only thing I found objectionable was that the\nQur'an was placed next to a bottle of intoxicants,\nsomething which has been forbidden by the\nQur'an. Also that the Qur'an has been associated\nwith the pagan festival of Christmas, which is\nmore of an event for commercial exploitation than\nthe commemoration of the birth of Jesus of whom\nthe Qur'an speaks of very highly.\nYours,\nT Sadi, Civ Eng\nAnonymous\nwriter avoids\nbitching\nDear Bill,\nI would like to reply to Mr McCall's letter\n(FELIX 821), which I quite frankly found\nsomewhat distasteful. As co-or d in at or of the\nHitsquad, I put in at least 60 hours of solid work\nduring Rag Week. For this I did not and still do\nnot expect any money/gifts/thanks/sympathy, in\nfact the only thing I did expect was to be flan ned myself. I did this job because I enjoyed it and,,\nalthough this may sound rather clich ed,I liked\nthe idea of others getting enjoyment out of my\nwork. The careers fair is organised on behalf of\nIC students and it is an a them a to me that an elite\nband should receive a gratuity, particularly when\none considers that most of the organisations\nrepresented at the Fair would carry out\nrecruitment drives in College regardless of\nwhether or not the Careers Fair existed. The\nIndsoc members gained much anyway:\norganisational experience, 'brownie points' and\ncontacts in companies,, a nice little line in their\nCV's and a sense of satisfaction in a job well\ndone. But no, this was not enough. What\nparticularly rankled was Mr McCall's statement\n'If we were to be paid properly then we would\neach receive over \u00a380'. Having, due to family\ncircumstances, spent the last nine years living and\nworking in the 'real' world I find his belief that\nhis right, as an undergraduate, to put a value to\nhis work both arrogant and naive. In essence, I believe that an event like this ought to be run on\na purely voluntary basis, with no thought of\npersonal gain, as are all other student events in\nthis College (eg Ents, Rag etc).\nSince I have no wish for Indsoc to batter me\nto death with their Filofaxes, I have refrained\nfrom making any of the following bitchy\ncomments:\ni. 'If brains were dynamite, McCall couldn't blow his nose.'\nii. 'Where I come from we say 'Where's there's muck there's brass', perhaps Indsoc Committee\nshould go and jump in a pile of dung.'\nPhew! Good job I avoided using those\ncomments.\nName withheld by request.\nAdverts in\nFELIX cost \u00a320\nDear Bill,\nJust thought I'd let you and all your readers\nknow what the RCSU Entertainments Committee\nintends to be getting up to in the coming months.\nTonight (Friday 13th) sees our first event selling\nburgers in Beit Quad during the Carnival. Please\nbuy some, we've got more than even I can\npossibly eat! The next event pencilled into my\ndiary is for the weekend starting March 11th when we'll be going to Amsterdam. Expect to pay\nabout \u00a350 for travel and accommodation,\ndepending on how many nights we actually\nspend there. In any case it should be far cheaper\nthan travelling individually.\nFinally, on Friday May 5th, is THE event of the\nyear: the Country House Ball at Silwood Park\nnear Ascot. Double tickets will cost \u00a355 and only\none hundred will be available. These will include\nsherry reception, transport, a glass of\nchampagne, a buffet meal, wine, band, disco,\nbreakfast, and a fabulous lighting display\ncourtesy of Dramsoc.\nYours sincerely,\nAndrew Dagli$h( RCSU Ents Comittee Chairman)\nMalayan\nCulture\nDear Editor,\nYour article on Malaysia written by Third World\nFirst in the issue of November 11 was extremely\ndisturbing to many Malaysians in Imperial\nCollege. I would therefore like to clarify several\npoints. In the process,' I do not wish to negate\nthe facts surrounding the article. However, I would like to point out the reasons for the actions\ndescribed in the article, for which the author has\nconveniently omitted to inform the reader.\nFirstly, in terms of the arms deal, anyone with\na knowledge of the Malaysian armed forces\nreadily accepts that it is the least equipped force\nin the region. Additionally, the military hardware\navailable is old and decrepit. Thus re-armament\nis necessary, given Malaysia's strategic location,\nto enhance her role in the defence of the sea lanes used for free world trade. The second, perhaps\nmore disturbing comment, related to the recent\narrests of the political dissidents. Malaysia is a culturally mixed country, so has a very volatile\nracial mixture. The people arrested have been\nfomenting discontent; bringing cultural and\nreligious prejudices to the fore. The actions that\nfollowed, despite their severity in Western terms,\nwere necessary to prevent the spread of racial\nviolence.\n/ Jengi, Mech Eng 2\nAUT Action\nhits exams\nDear Student,\nThis term, your lecturers, supported by other\nuniversity staff, will be refusing to set and mark\nexaminations. You may be adversely affected by\nthis action and we therefore want you to\nunderstand why it is being taken. This 'exams\nboycott' is being held by members of the\nAssociation of University Teachers (AUT) as part\nof their campaign to achieve decent salaries. After\n12 months of negotiation, their employers\n(represented by university Vice Chancellors and\nprincipals) have refused to offer any salary\nincrease at all for 1988. Over the last decade\nsalaries have fallen (in real terms) b v over 20%.\nProblems in retaining, recruiting and motivating\nhigh calibre academic and related staff have\nescalated beyond recognition. If good staff cannot\nbe attracted to a university career, then the\nstudents of tomorrow will suffer as Britain loses\nits in te rational reputation for excellence in higher\neducation.\nThe action means that members of the\nAssociation of University Teachers (which\nrepresents 30,000 professors, lecturers, librarians,\nadministrators, researchers and computer staff in\nUK university institutions) are withdrawing from\nthe examination process and the administrative\nprocess which supports it:\n-examination papers will not be set\n-examinations will not be in vigil a ted examination papers will not be marked\nIn continuous assessment, feedback will be\ngiven, but not formal marks. The action continues\nuntil Vice Chancellors have made their staff a reasonable pay offer for 1988 and agreed a timetable for negotiations for 1989.\nWe are very sorry that it has been necessary\nfor us to take this drastic action, but we have been\nforced into a position where we cannot see any\nalternative. If you have any questions about the\naction, please do not hesitate to contact me at the\nnumber below.\nThank you.\nYours sincerely,\nSusan Parry, President, 1C AUT Ext: 96292/3338\nPage 2 FELIX January 13 1989\n\n"

    "content": "READING\n\"Before we meet tomorrow, you should read these few references.\" An enormous list of journals, dates and\npages appears on the blackboard. You know damn well there won't be enough time to read them all as well as\nwrite up that lab report for tomorrow, but\\jou might do it at the weekend...\nT he purpose of this feature is to\nhelp with such problems and\nperhaps to provide benefits in\nother situations. Having seen the\ntitle, vo u already know what the\nsubject is - speed reading.\nAn improvement in reading speed\nprovides many advantages,\nincluding the obvious attraction of\nbeing able to complete some coursework in record time. It could also\nmean being able to read one or more\ndail v papers, as well as monthly\njournals and novels.\nOne benefit, perhaps unexpected,\nis that faster reading can lead to\nincreased comprehension. Everyone\nis. no doubt, familiar with the\nfollowing rather embarrassing\nsituation:\nHaving almost finished a practical\nwrite-up, you find that you\ndesperately need to read through an\narticle in a past 'Xature.' You dash\noff to the library, find the required\narticle, and start plodding through\nit, bored out of v our skull.\nEventually you come to the end and\nstop, trying to remember anything\nabout what you've just read.\nXothing comes to mind. What a waste of time! Oh well, back to the\nbeginning...\nThis situation wouldn't arise if\nreading automatically meant\ncomprehension of a text.\nUnfortunately it doesn't. And slow\nreading is more likely to lead to\nboredom than faster reading, which\nin turn, is more likely to lead to lack\nof concentration with corresponding\nlack of comprehension. Hence, by\nincreasing reading speed, not only\nis text covered quicker, but\ncomprehension is also enhanced.\nIn the following article. 1 hope to\noutline some of the causes of slow\nreading and also to present some\nsuggestions that could improve your\nreading speed considerably.\nAnvway, enough of why vo u should read this feature, and on\nwith the Show':1\n.'.\nworth the work. The first thing to\ndo is to cast v our attention to the\nbookshelf. See a dictionary? If not,\nthen vo u might consider buying\none. For the rest of this discussion,\nit is assumed that vo u do have easy\naccess to one. A thesaurus is\nperhaps less useful to the reader,\n\"Using these techniques, and\nafter some practice you may find\nyour reading speed increases\n400% or more\"\nVOCABULARY\nA limited vocabulary, although\na problem in itself, can lead to\nother difficulties detailed\nbelow. Unable to understand fully\nsome word or phrase, our natural\nreaction is to stop, think, and reread the offending section. This\ntendency to back-skip and re-read\ntext is, as explained below,\nsymptomatic of deeper problems\nregarding poor eye movements\nwhile reading. Improving your\nvocabulary will, then, cure many\nproblems at once.\nThe small effort required to\nimprove your vocabulary may seem,\ndaunting, but the results are well\nbut is invaluable to anyone wanting\nto write.\nTried and tested methods for\nexpanding vocabulary include\nattempting to introduce a new word\ndaily into conversation. Despite\nsounding good in theory, this idea\nis not so practical for the average IC\nstudent; it might be useful to know\nthe meaning of 'sarcophagus', but\nto use it in a quantum mechanics\ntutorial may prove to be a little\ntricky...\nRather more practical is the idea\nof referring to the dictionary upon\nencountering an unfamiliar term\nwhile reading. Note that the most\nbeneficial way to do this is to skip\nthe unknown word on a first\nreading, then look it up at the end\nto avoid interruption. [Tie word is\nthen referred to in the context of the\noriginal text, hopefully fixing its\nmeaning firmly in the mind.\nProbably the improvement\nmethod of greatest return is one that\ncan not be fully covered here: it\ninvolves learning lists ot pre suffixes\nfound in many 'speed reading' or\n'vocabulary training' books. Such\nlists, once learnt, allow immediate\ncomprehension of words built from\na root with attached prefix or suffix.\nFc\u00bbr example:\ncx lm mean* outside or Ivuoud\nterm from the Latin means earth\nSo extraterrestrial (ET come\nhome!) means 'occurring beyond\nthe earth'\nAlso apparent from this example\nis that the Latin vo u may have,\nunwillingly studied during\nsecondary education is actually\nuseful. In fact, lists ot common Latin\nor Greek roots are often presented\nalongside the lists of pre/suffixes.\nEYE MOVEMENTS\nN ow onto some of the\nmechanics of reading, and in\nparticular the eye movements\ntaken when reading a piece of text.\nSurprisingly, the eye only sees\nproperly when actually fixed on an\nobject, and so when reading, your\neyes jump along lines of text in a series of small hops. Although it\nma v feel as if they are moving\nsmoothly across the page, this is not\nthe case.\nThe situation is further\ncomplicated by the backward leaps\nPage 12 FELIX January 13 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\nThe\nDressmaker\nBritish fim s are as good as any in\nthe world. At least the good ones\nare. It VOU have any doubt, this\nshould change your mind.\nThe Dressmaker takes us back to\nthe end of the war. The people of\nLiverpool are still suffering the\noppression of rationing and\nwartime regulations. As such they\nlive in the shadow of the affluent\nAmerican GI's though with small\nworn- of impending doom as was\nfelt in earlier times.\nThe title role is taken by loan\nPlowright. She represents all that\nis the moral and stern remnants\nof Victorian England, in the form\nof Nellie.\nCohabitant in their two-up-two-down terraced house is Margo\n(Billie Whitelaw), Nellie's sister.\nShe is an amorous middle-aged\nwoman with all the bounce and\nmodernity of a Glenn Miller tune.\nRita (lane Horrocks) is their 17\nyear-old niece. While desperately\nattempting to grow up she\nremains a product of her aunts\nupbringing. Relentlessly she\napproaches a rendezvous with\nthe pitfalls of adolescence.\nTogether the three form a contented family. Only a contrasting view of men can\nseparate Nellie and Margo. Rita\nmaintains a confused stance in\nbetween.\nOpportunity to resolve her\nbewilderment arrives when\nWesley, a GI appears. Love rears\nits ugly head. As the relationship\ndevelops, yet refuses to blossom,\nthe conflict of opinion threatens\nto disrupt the family ever further.\nThe stor v is not complex in any\nway. Written in 1973 it earned\nauthoress Beryl Bainbridge a Booker Prize nomination. The\nworld in which this tale is set is\nsimple and identifiable,\npopulated by easily recognisable\ncharacters. The cast are accessible\nto all but the most blinkered of\naudiences.\nQuickly draw n into their lives\nwe are obliged to remain, to\nobserve the full extent of Wesley's intrusion, the path is sorrowful\nbut fortunately one scattered with\nmuch humour.\nThe exploration of feelings and\naccompanying perplexity of\nhopes and fears inherent in a first\nlove is a theme to which we can\nall relate. The protection felt and\ndependence built are often\nmisleading. We can see where it\nis all heading and sym pathis e fully with Rita, who can't. The Dressmaker is an engaging\npiece of cinema. There is possibly\nnot enough feel for the city itself\nbut otherwise the film is largely\nflawless. This is an ideal way to\nrekindle a few fond teenage\nmemories, and a fairly\nentertaining way of passing an\nevening.\nAndrew Clarke\nFirst love, first b, ss\nThe Making of\nthe Representative for Planet\n8\nPhilip Glass\nDoris Lessing\nWhilst opera can encompass\nmany subjects and musical styles\nit generally includes singing and\nsome dramatic action to keep us\nentertained. Planet 8 has virtually\nno action, a trek through an icefield is hardly rivetting stuff, and\nno one really sings a song as such.\nInstead the dialogue is spoken\nand the chorus intone melodically\nor otherwise 'to add to the\nmusical atmosphere' or so it says\nin the notes.\nPhilip Glass, for those who\nhave never come across him is a minimalist, and his music\ninvolves three or four note\narpeggios repeated incessantly\nuntil the third flautist makes a mistake and the rest of the\norchestra follow him into a different arpeggio. Hence the\nmusic 'progresses'. It is hypnotic,\natmospheric and at times\ndistinctly tedious, even if you like\nthis sort of thing. Thus Planet 8\nhas fewer tunes than your\naverage Lloyd Webber fart, but\nwe get recurring themes which\nmade me wonder if I was\nwatching one three act opera or\na one act opera three times.\nDoris Lessing is an authoress\nwho writes 'consistently refusing\nto accept restrictions on her\nsubject matter'. To be unkind she\nis a communist, feminist, science\nfiction writer and in Planet 8 she\nused all these traits to the full.\nThe plot to Planet 8 is simple.\nParadise planet suddenly gets\ncold and everyone dies except one\n(The Representative). There is a wall, a guardian from another\nplanet and a wicked glacier which\nBartholemew\nFair\nA3' A hour play may seem\nexcessively long to some; a recipe\nfor boredom perhaps. However,\nthe National Theatre's production\nof Bartholomew Fair never flags for\nan instant. At least vo u get v our money's worth! Dont miss it.\nOriginally written in 1614, the\nplay has been transposed to\nVictorian England. Bartholomew\nFair was a festival celebrated\nannually since 11 13, when Henry\n1 gave a grant to hold it. In the\nplay, the enormous cast (over 50\npeople) dance around,the stage in\na sometimes bewildering array of\nvulgar and outrageous scenes.\nTwo respectable married women\nbecome whores (one of whom is\npregnant); a widow is determined\nto marry a madman; a clergyman\nin pink women's underwear\nshares the stocks with an\nundercover judge; greasy Ursula\n(Mark Addv), the pig woman of\noutrageous proportions flounders\nabout on stage; the culmination\ncomes with an \\-rated puppet\nshow .\nThe whole cast performs so well\nthat it is impossible to pick out\nany one actor from the rest for\ntheir performance. Possibly the\nstar performer is the stage itself:\ningenious, versatile and colourful,\nWilliam Dudley's multi-faceted\nset creates a turbulent fairground\natmosphere. A different backdrop\ntt i each scene was produced so\nfluid lv so as not to divert from the\nmotion of the play.\nThis production is staged at the\nNational Theatre, South Bank\nCentre. Performance dates vary,\nthe Box Office telephone number\nis 01-928 2252. Prices vary from\nstudent standby at \u00a35 to \u00a314.\nDavid Robbins and Wendy Kite.\nrolls around the stage like a demented Python creation,\ngobbling up the natives. The\nlighting is atmospheric (must stop\nusing that word) but three hours\nof subdued ice-bound effects is\nmonotonous and 1 came out\nlonging for sunshine.\nThis controversial opera has\nmuch to recommend it. There are\ntwo intervals and the ice cream is\nvery nice. It has now finished its\ninaugural run in London but\ndespite universal critical approval,\nsold out swiftly and is bound to\nsurface again at a later date.

In the end, over\n\u00a31,100 was raised for Great Ormond\nStreet Hospital and both RCS and\nC&G went away ha ppv. Perhaps\nthe most famous theft of mascots\nwas perpetrated on S&B in 1976. An RCS man arrived in college to do\nPhvsics exactly at the same time as\na Guildsman failed to arrive to study\nChemical Engineering. Bv\ncoincidence the v had the same\nname\u2014Martin Watson. The RCS Martin Watson was prevailed upon\nto go to C&G lectures, hang around\nin their Office, go on their Rag\nstunts and generally pretend to be\nthe C&G Martin Watson (who\nwasn't around to clarify matters).\nAfter a term of doing this, he was\nentrusted with the task of being a link in the car chain that was\nbringing the mascots into College.\nRCS hired him a car, he sat at the\nrendezvous, C&G delivered the\nmascots to him for transport to the\nnext rendezvous and he turned S&B over to a waiting RCS van instead.\nIt was so subtle v done that it was\nquite a time before C&G realised\ntheir mascots were actually missing.\nThat was the first time that S&B had\nbeen taken together.\nJezebel, Boanerges and Clementine\nThese are the motorised mascots of\nthe RC S,C&G andR SM respectively. Though Jez has been\nstolen by UCL students before now,\nand Bo has had his headlights\nnicked in the past, the v are not\nviolate (ie legitimate targets) and\nanyone who threatens to do them\ndamage usually gets subjected to\nhours of torture with fire axes, larger\nhammers and rock cutting lasers.\nThey are far too valuable to be\nmucked about with and are a credit\nto the dedication of the people who\nlook after them.\nuniversity education, rather than on\nthe education of life. Old traditions\nsuch as the Morphy Day battle,\nthrowing people in the Round\nPond, painting zebra crossings\nacross Prince Consort Road etc are\nfading into the background to make\nway for problem sheets, lab reports\nand a swift half down in Southside\nat 10pm. Few, if any, other colleges\nengage in mascot ry and the few that\ndo (primarily medical schools) don't have any organised rules.\nHowever, there's a latent\nten dancy tor nicking things in most\nstudents, whether it's signs, glasses\nfrom pubs, street furniture or food\nfrom fridges. Although mascot ry comes in for quite a panning from\nthe general student body ('I'm not\nstanding up for some scrappy lump\nof metal, it's so childish'), if it's done properly, cleverly and achieves its aim\u2014raising money for\ncharity\u2014then it's as valid as any\nother club.\nThere's a mythology that has\ngrown up around this activity and\nmany apocryphal stories are to be\nhad. For instance, did you know\nthat RS M once stole Chelsea\nCollege's Anchor by blowing it out\nof the wall of their College with\ngelignite? Did you also know that\nthey then buried the anchor in the\nKing's Road? Has Mike really got\n' QM C1969' engraved on his shaft?\nIs Spanner M kl actually on the roof\nof K QC' s Union Building? How many times has Theta been stored\nin the tunnels beneath 1C? Is Davey\nkept in Kensington Palace? Is Mike\nreally hidden at the top of the\nQueen's Tower (as K QC believe)?\nFor every embellished story, there\nare two real ones which are much\nmore fun.\nGuilds and Mines once kept the\nentire population of RCS barricaded\ninto Chemistry for two days,\nremoving the trousers of anyone\ncaught using the tunnels to escape.\nDuring a dispute with Chelsea\nand QM C one year, it was decided\nto teach these lesser colleges not to\nmess with IC. Posing as a Chelsea\nstudent, a chap ran up QM C and\ntold them of a planned raid on IC\nthe following Wednesday lunchtime. QM C agreed to help in\nthe raid (of custard pies etc) and a meeting place was arranged. Then\nChelsea were contacted and told the\nsame story by the same chap posing\nas a QM C student. Come Wednesday, and the two raiding\nparties were met and led to Beit\nQuad. Once inside, their contacts\nvanished, the gates were locked and\nhordes of students, rugby teams etc\netc appeared armed with fire hoses,\nbuckets of refectory slops and used\noil. The ensuing battle resulted in\nthe trouncing of QM C and Chelsea\u2014College Security Chief\nGeoff Reeves was called, he took\none look through the locked gates\nof Beit Quad, pronounced that he\nhadn't seen a thing and left again.\nQM C and Chelsea spent the next\nfew weeks accusing each other of\nsetting the other up.\nThough this isn't strictly\nmascot rv, it's along the same lines.\nBy and large, mascot ry looks after\nitself. All attempts to formalise the\nrules, impose penal i ties and curb\nthe somewhat chaotic nature of\nactivities have met with limited\nsuccess. Guilds and RCS accept the\nspirit of the game (evident from the\npleasant nature of the S&B Treasure\nHunt recently) and very rarely do\nthings get out of hand. Mines are a slightly different bucket of\nhaddock\u2014they don't care about\nmuch, except maintaining their own\nidentity and 'fair enough' to that.\nHowever, you've got to be a bit\ncareful as regards Davey. No use\ntrying to take it b v force, or\noverwhelming numbers because\nthey're of the opinion that baseball\nbats arc legitimate mascot ry tools.\nThe almost complete destruction of\nMaths Lecture Theatre 213 several\nyears ago resulted from a small RS M contingent requesting the return of\ntheir mascot in their own inimitable\nfashion! To get a hold of Davev you\nneed either a daft mistake on their\npart, unbelievably sus sed plans or\na small thermonuclear device. The\nlast of these is an impractical itv, the\nsecond is down to you and the first\nis just a matter of time.\nWhen it comes to the crunch,\nImperial is a unique place. We have\nunique traditions, a unique union\nstructure and a uniquely eccentric\nair that sets us apart from the\npredominantly militant rest of the\nUniversity environment. As the\nSunday Times put it in its review of\nUniversities a couple of v ears ago:\n'Imperial is conservative,\nchauvinistic and booz v( Ladies\nRugby!!)'\nMascotry may get a bad press at\ntimes, perhaps people feel that\ntraditions are stupid and we should\nbe concentrating on survival, but to\ndestroy a society vo u first have to\nremove its identity and while such\nquaint pastimes as, for instance,\ncherishing some lumps of metal\n(where the penalty for not doing it\nproperly is the generation of funds\nfor a childrens' hospital) continue to\nbe championed then I submit that\nwe will live through the worst\nexcesses of any government and\noutlast all those others who are\nfrantically sacrificing their principles\njust to stay alive.\nSimon Banton, BSc ARCS\nRCS Broadsheet Editor 1983-4\nRCSA Record Editor 1988\nWith times as hard as they are now\nfor students, the emphasis is much . ,. . . .\nmore on the work aspect of a A fire engine with a slum/ bell\nJanuary 13 1989 FELIX Page L> "

    "content": "Travel\n^INDEPENDENT\nELLERTRAVELLERTRAVELLERTRAVELLERTRAVELLERTRAVELLERTRAVELLERTRAVELLERTRAV\nRAIL EUROPE\nGone are the great days of rail\ntravel\u2014when the rich took the\nluxurious Orient Express to\nIstanbul, and rail was the only way\nto travel across Europe. The\naeroplane put paid to that.\nHowever, in recent years rail travel\nhas been revived as a cheap way for\nyoung people M see Europe. The\nnational rail companies of many\ncountries, in an attempt to fill empty\ntrains, have opened up a series of\ncheap fare deals for under 26's, that\nhas led to the European rail network\nbeing inn undated by thousands of\nbackpackers every summer, intent\non 'doing' as much of Europe as\npossible in the time available.\nRail is an ideal way to see Europe.\nThe network is the densest in the\nworld; nearly any destination can be\nreached by rail, and if this is not\npossible, the rail head will be only\na coach's journey away from the\ndestination. There is no lack of\ncompanions on your journeys,\nclimb aboard any train with\nbackpack in tow and you will soon\nstrike up a conversation with any>\ninter- rail ers on the train. And, take\na bottle of the local gut rot and a few\ngoodies from the local supermarket\nwith you to while away the hours\non long journeys, the guards always\nseem pleased to share it with you!\nBecause the network is so\nextensive, there is no limit to the\nit in aries available. In fact, everybody\nseems to do it a different way. Many\npeople use a ticket as a cheap way\nto reach the Greek islands for a laze\non the beach, taking in a few\nEuropean cities on the way, or there\nare the manic inter-rail ers who\nspend their time sleeping\nexclusively on trains, 'doing' every\ncountry in Europe during the period\nof the ticket. There are also the\nspecialists, who travel to one\ncountry and then tour it in detail,\nlike the two Oxbridge types who\nspent a month touring the Gothic\ncathedrals of northern France\n(yawn!). Whatever your fancy,\nEurope is your oyster.\nTHE OPTIONS\nThere are essentially two ways to\nsee Europe by train on the cheap -Inter-Rail and Transalpino. Both are\nonly available to under 26s, and if\nyou don't fit that category, then\nthings can get very expensive.\nAn Inter-Rail card, available from\nmajor British Rail stations, gives you\nunlimited rail travel for one month\nthrough 21 countries in Europe,\nincluding Morocco, European\nTurkey, Hungary and Rumania. The\nbasic card costs \u00a3145, but an InterRail + Boat card is also available for\n\u00a3175, which also allows free travel\non some Mediterranean,\nScandinavian and Irish shipping\nroutes. Either card will also give a34% discount on rail fares in the\nUnited Kingdom, and a discount on\ncross channel ferries. It is a good\nidea to remember that it will cost\nquite a bit to leave and return to the\nU.K. when budgeting for an InterRail trip. Also, you can only travel\non standard second class trains. This\ncan be a problem in some countries,\nparticular i ly Spain, where extra\nsupplements have to be paid for\ntravelling express, or in air\nconditioned luxury.\nA Transalpino ticket is available\nfrom one of several Transalpino\nshops in London (see the telephone\ndirectory). Normally, the ticket will\nbe a return to a single destination,\nvalid for two months. The great\nstrength of Transalpino is that the\noutward and return journeys can be\nmade via two different routes, and\nEiffel Tower, Paris.\nstops can be made at any point\nalong the route. Transalpino tickets\nare also valid twice as long as InterRail, and compare favourably in\nprice. In order to take best\nadvantage of Transalpino, choose a distant destination like Athens, and\nthen travel out via Italy and the\nferry, and then return via\nYugoslavia and Northern Europe.\nFares within Great Britain and\nchannel crossings are included in\nthe price of the ticket.\nVISAS\nAn extra expense for those travelling\nto Eastern Block countries, and non\nEEC nationals in France, will be a visa. These can normally be\npurchased on the border, but it is\nbest to check with the relevant\nembassy in London. Note that\nBulgaria is not part of Inter-Rail, so\nto travel to Istanbul one must pay\nthe extra to travel through Bulgaria,\nor take the roundabout route via\nSalonica in Greece. The really\nadventurous can take a train to\nMoscow, and then on to Peking on\nthe Trans-Siberian railway.\nTHE TRAINS\nAccomodation on international\ntrains in Europe is pretty\nstandard\u2014coaches with\ncompartments seating eight people.\nHowever, the state of the coaches is\nhighly dependent on the country of\norigin. On international trains,\nNorthern European and French\ncoaches are the best, Spanish and\nItalian can be okay, but they can also\nbe bad, and avoid Yugoslavian\ncoaches like the plague. In the south\nof Spain, go for air conditioning if\nat all possible.\nFor journeys within individual\ncountries, the same standards as\nabove seem to apply, but there are\nalways exceptions to any rule!\nThe truly hardened traveller will\nroll out his or her sleeping bag on\nthe floor without complaining on an\novernight trip, but for those who\nprefer a little comfort for those long\njourneys, couch et tes are available.\nCouchette compartments seat six\npeople, and can be converted to\nsleep six people on beds in relative\ncomfort. You are provided with\nsheets, and a guard to wake you in\nthe morning. Again, these are pretty\nstandard.\nPage 6 FELIX January 13 1989\n\n"

    "content": "News\n\"The action proposed by the AUT is perverse on several counts.\" Professor Eric Ash\nIC To Suffer Exam Disruption\nAs AUT Action Continues\nThe Association of University\nTeachers (AUT) have started a nationwide boycott of student\nexaminations after its salary\nnegotiating body, the Committee of\nVice-Chancellors and Principals\n(CVCP), refused to make a pay offer\nlast April for 1988.\nThe AUT claims that the salaries\nof its members have fallen by over\n20% in real terms over the last\ndecade. This will lead to increasing\nproblems in retaining, recruiting\nand motivating high-calibre\nacademic staff, they say. A spokesman for the AUT told FELIX,\n\"students of the year 2000 will be\ngetting a much poorer deal.\"\nIn reply, the CVCP withdrew\nfrom negotiating a salary increase on\n9th December 1988 and has now\ntold Vice-Chancellors throughout\nfinal results of their action are still\nuncertain.\nThe 23rd Report\nIn 1986 the AUT and the CVCP\nagreed a pay package which both\nsides agree was designed to bring\nacademic and related staff's salaries\nin line with those in the private\nsector. The '23rd Report', as it is\nknown, agreed a pay rise of 16% on\nthe 1st December 1986 and an\nincrease of 7\n% on the 1st March\n1988.\nThe CVCP claims that this\npackage covers pay rises up to and\nincluding 1988/89. A spokesman for\nthe CVCP told FELIX that it was\nagreed in 1986 that there would be\nno pay rise in 1988/89. The AUT\nrefutes this, saying that the 23rd report also contains a section which\nThe Rector has expressed his disapproval\nof the AUTs action in a letter to\nthe Times on 7th December\nthe country that they may take\naction against staff who take part in\nthe dispute in one of three ways:\nthey may deduct staff's wages;\nsummarily dismiss them; or send\nthem home without pay, since AUT\nmembers taking part in the action\nwill be in breach of their contracts.\nLast Friday an informal meeting\nbetween the CVCP and the AUT\nconsidered a3% rise for 1988. This\nwas later dismissed by a formal\nmeeting of the CVCP which it felt\nthat any offer would be so small that\nit would only inflame the situation.\nThe CVCP claims that there is\nsimply not enough money to give a pav rise for 1988. A spokesman for\nthe CVCP told FELIX that, \"there\nnever was any question\" of a pay\nrise for 1988-89.\nStudents at Imperial College are\nlikely to be affected by the dispute.\nSpecifically, AUT members in the\ndepartments of Computing,\nBiochemistry and Civil Engineering\nhave agreed to participate in the\nboycotting of exams although the\nrecognises that a further pay\nincrease should be necessary in\n1988/89, although the report makes\nno financial provision for it.\nHaving fulfilled the financial\nrequirements of the 23rd report, the\nCVCP is currently holding informal\nmeetings with the Department of\nEducation and Science (DES)\nregarding pay rises for 1989/90.\nThe Action at Imperial\nThe Rector has expressed his\ndisapproval of the AUT's action in\na letter to the Times on 7th December. Signed by several ViceChancellors, the letter ends by\nsaying, \"we cannot, in conscience,\nsupport such action and would\ntp peal to all our colleagues to\nhonour their contracts and their\nobligations.\" A letter following this\npointed out that Professor Ash had\nnot suggested any alternative form\nof action to an exam boycott in his\nletter.\nIn a brief survey of the\ndepartments by FELIX, many heads\nof departments reported that\nstudent examinations would not be\naffected by the action. Union\nmembers gave a different view in\nsome cases.\nThe head of the Civil Engineering\nDepartment asked his policy\nadvisory committee to decide\nwhether exams could be held at the\nbeginning of this ter:-n. The\ncommittee, on which the A JT is not\nofficially represented, concluded\nthat it would be detrimental to the\nstudents if exams were de hye d. At\nthe end of last term the Head of\nDepartment informed th,rd year\nstudents whose exams were\nscheduled for earlier this week, that\nexams would go ahead as planned.\nWhen the AUT asked the Head to\ndelay the exams at the beginning of\nthis term, he informed them that he\nfelt it would be unfair on students\nsince he had already told them that\nexams would go ahead. The AUT\nmembers in the Civil Engineering\nDepartment have indicated that\nalthough the exams have taken\nplace, they may not be marked.\nIn the Biochemistry Department,\na secret ballot has indicated that the\naction has widespread support.\nStudents on one course have been\nwarned that although examinations\nwill be set, they will not take place\nor be marked. An AUT member\nfrom the Biochemistry Department\ntold FELIX that a number of\ndepartments had not held secret\nballots but had held a simple head\ncount by the Head of Department.\nHe complained that this was\nunreasonable since Heads of\nDepartments \"decide who gets\npromoted and who gets blocked.\"\nThe Computing Department has\nalso balloted its members, and an\nAUT member told FELIX that action\nwould be likely.\nOther departments, including\nPhysics, Electrical Engineering and\nPure and Applied Biology told\nFELIX that they did not envisage\nany effects. Many departments,\nhowever, were reluctant to discuss\nthe action.\nNice Mr\nNorthey\nStocks\nStudents'\nRooms\nIt is estimated that over \u00a33,300\nworth of trays have 'gone missing'\nfrom College Refectories recently.\nRefectories Manager, Mr Rob\nNorthey was unable to explain the\nloss. 'If I knew where they were\ngoing,' he said, 'I would be\nretrieving them.'\nHe estimates that over 1,000\npieces of cutlery have met with a similar fate this term, and told\nFELIX, 'at the beginning of term we\nstock up all the student rooms.'\nAnd\nFinally...\nThe prestigious Charles Brereton\nMemorial Handicap singles snooker\ntournament has been won this year\nby Pravat Bhattachayya.\nIn a tense final, Mr Bhattachayya\nsnatched the \u00a330 prize from his\nopponent, Brian Kerr on the last ball\nof the frame.\nThe winner was presented with a six inch wood and plastic trophy by\nthe late Mr Brereton (R.I.P) who\nthen dragged him into the FELIX\noffice for an interview.\nThe shy and overawed winner sat\ncowering whilst Mr Brereton\nrepeatedly insisted that he be\ninterviewed.\nMr Bhattachayya eventually\ncommented 'Look at this trophy.

Now,\nthere is a reason for this, and it is\nnot just because I can't manage to\nfind the energy to get out of the\noffice long enough to find\nsomething really interesting to write\nabout. No, the content is dominated\nmore b v the collective insanity\nsuffered b v the more active parts of\nImperial College Union, and this is\nwhy Gutterpress is taking this\nopportunity to appeal to you.\nThe next few paragraphs are best\nread with a piece of orange peel\nstuck behind your top lip, a freshly\npeeled onion and the theme music\nto Hearts of Gold' or 'Children in\nNeed'.\nWhen people find themselves\nworking for the union they can be\ndrawn into a trap of promises and\ndelusion. As committee post after\ncommittee post piles up, the sheer\nweight of self-importance is enough\nto crush most ordinary mortals, and\nit usually does. However, the only\nsymptoms are not a tendency\ntowards Napoleonic megalomania\nand a need to talk at length about\nhow jol lv democratic UGMs are\nbecause 'as soon as you get to a good bit someone calls quorum;\nthere's power for minorities'.\nThere can be potentially more\ndevastating consequences, usually\nrevolving around the concept of the\nElection. These exercises in\npart ici pati ve democracy generally\ntake place when posts cannot be\ncarved up amicably and can cause\na great deal of trauma for\nprospective candidates. They can\nfind themselves doing all sorts of\nodd and highly report able deeds in\norder to st av in print and, if they are\nnot sick over too many people, in\nvotes.\nThe traumas become increasingly\nsevere as sabbatical elections creep\never closer, until the strain becomes\ntoo much and they come into a headlong collision with this column\nwhich, considering it is only\n0.05mm thick, can be quite painful.\nThere is only way to stop this\nhideous carnage and wanton waste\nof human quasi-life. When the\nposters say 'Vote!', ignore them.Try\nnot to let the fact that someone ate\nan entire caterpillar thinking it was\na snack bar meal influence your\ndecision. When somebody pushes\na flyer under your door, read it\ncarefully, peruse its inner meaning\nand f lambe it in a white spirit sauce.\nWhatever vo u do, when it comes to\nballot box time, JUST SAY NO!\nYou'll only encourage them.\nAs an example of the mindless\nfolly of becoming involved in\nsabbatical elections we will take as\nour victim the FELIX Editor, a Mr\nWilliam R Goodwin.\nI remember Bill when he wanted\nto be a reporter on FELIX many\nyears ago. He would rush into the\noffice and be given a task which\ngenerally revolved around knocking\non people's doors in Linstead and\nasking them questions about food,\nrent strikes and Bobbie Robson's man ag ment of the England football\nsquad. This would take up much of\nBill's time, and that didn't include\nthe Linstead extension.\nEventually he became unhappy\nwith his lot and became News\nEditor, and finally he was so\nunhappy that he ran for FELIX\nEditor and won. However, it was\ntoo late to save him.\nHe decided that bringing out a FELIX every Friday was not enough\nto slake his thirst, even if he did\nhave to do it with three-and-a half\nstaff and a rusty pair of scissors. He\nthought that he could bring a little\nhappiness into the world with the\npatter of tiny feet.\nNo, not another bloody\ncaterpillar. Babies, loads of them.\nHe took it upon himself to launch\nattacks on all sorts of unsuspecting\nvictims and offer his services as a surrogate mother, the current state\nof medical technology not with standing, with the immortal words:\nT want his/her/your babies.' Nigel\nBaker, Paul Shanley and a certain\nold dinosaur and washed-up\nsabbatical candidate have all\nfeatured high on Bill's list.\nHowever, due to popular\ndemand, Gutterpress is running a book on who's next, with Wendy\nMorris at 40-1 and Clare Ash and an\nunnamed wide mouthed frog in\nLondon Zoo running neck and neck\nat 10-1.\nNow, once upon a time there was\nan erstwhile member of Motor Club\nknown by the highly descriptive\nmoniker of 'Joe 90', not least for his\npassion for totally und riva ble cars\nand the fact that he is a complete\nsleaze ball. Joe's reputation is so complete\nthat FELIX Editor Bill Goodwin's only claim to fame, other than a desire to be the first male surrogate\nmother, is that he was Joe's lab\npartner way back in the distant past.\nTo fill in a little background, Joe\nis not someone who believes in the\neasy way to do things. Show him a can of beans and at in opener and\nhe'll open it by holding the tin\nopener in his teeth and driving over\nthe can with a Mini.\nWhich brings us conveniently on\nto cars. That's nice, because Joe likes\ncars, especially ones with with the\ns**t kicked out of them and no\nsense of direction.\nWhen Joe went to make his latest\npurchase he sought the most\nclapped out old wreck he could find,\nand he was not disappointed. The\nold owner found that his prize\npossession (well you have to dress\nit up a little) failed its MoT so badly\nthat he decided not to pay its road\ntax or insurance as it was not going\nfar.\nAll this did not worry Joe, not even\nthe knotty problem of getting the\nobject home. \"I 'll drive it,\" he\nthought, even after seeing those old\npolice favourites, Irish number\nplates. \"No problem,\" said he.\nIn fact, he was so successful that\nhe decided to go for a celebration\ndrink in Southside on the way\nhome, just so that he could give the\nr ozz ers a real excuse to pull him\nover.\nf is sei> OCA\nWALTER WALTER WALTER On casting an eye over his files,\nWalter observes that it is almost two\nyears since last his presence cast a literary shadow over these pages -two years which have seen the rise\nto power of Kenneth Papa Doc\nBaker in the government, and of\nNigel Baby Doc Baker in the Union.\nIt is highly encouraging to see our\nnew President working so tirelessly\nto achieve the very ends treasured\nby his namesake in the Department\nof Education.\nWalter is rather less encouraged\nto note that the price of a pint of\nbitter beer in the Union Bar has\nreached the order of one pound.\nThe new decor in the Snack Bar\nlooks pretty expensive. Far be it\nfrom an v one in this column to\nsuggest that these two facts may be\nconnected... or that the new decor,\nin addition to looking expensive,\nalso looks quite repulsive and is\ncertainly not an improvement on the\nold.\nAfter strict orders from both his\ndoctor and his psychiatrist Walter is\nunable to drink alcohol, so it was\nover a large orange juice in the\nabove mentioned Union Bar that he\nwas informed of the theft of a television camera from that arbiter\nof broadcast excellence, STOIC. His\ninformant seemed quite agitated,\nwhich seems strange when vo u consider that the loss of a camera\nhere or there means little to a television station which manages to\nspend \u00a3 3 5 0 0 every year\nbroadcasting nothing at all.\nWhilst on the subject of theft, we\nmust give credit where credit is due.\nAll praise to the Union supremo s who have caused a new lock system\nto be fitted in the union building.\nRather less praise to their initial\ndecision not to give the FELIX Editor\na kev to the new lock on the door\noutside his own office. Walter\nunderstands half an hour of\nshouting at the Deputy President\nwas required to reverse this policy.\nAnd after Bill has been so nice to\nthem, too.\nCompletely changing tack, have\nany readers noticed that our area of\nLondon appears to have been the\nsu j ect of a quiet international\ntakeover? Walter would like to\nsuggest that the road we used to\nknow as Gloucester Road should be\nrenamed \"The Independant State of\nAustralia in Exile\". With that\nthought, we leave you.\nla nua rv131989 FELIX Pace 3\n\n"

This activity can be either\nconscious or unconscious; in both\ncases your eyes move backwards\nthrough text to continue reading\nfrom a point 'upstream' of the\ncurrent reading position. Clearly\nthis action is as te ful, and, as\nexplained below, it is also\nunnecessary most of the time.\nThe typical eye movements of a normal reader are shown in Fig. 1.\nThis diagram shows the small leaps\ntaken across lines of text with the\nsuperimposed back-skipping\nmovements, the length of which\nmay vary from one word to a sentence to an entire paragraph.\nThe first obvious step in\nimprovement of eye movements is\nto increase the length of the basic\neye-jumps. Initially, this must be\ndone consciously by forcing yourself\nto jump over a group of words,\npausing, and then taking another\nleap. This action is shown in Fig. 2.\nClearly, in taking such long leaps\nover the text, you are relying on\nperipheral vision, that is, the ability\nto see outside the optimum field of\nvision. When the eye is fixed on a word, you can see, and recognise\nwords on either side of the point of\nfocus. Fast reading exploits this\nability; advanced speed-readers can\nmove their focus down multiple\nlines of type when reading a newspaper column, and still fully\ncomprehend what they are reading.\nProbably the greatest hurdle to\novercome when initially trying out\nthis lengthening of your eye-jumps\nis the fear that you are not\nunderstanding the text. At first,\nyour leaps should be relatively\nsmall; larger jumps come with\npractice. As far as understanding\nthe text is concerned, don't worry,\nyou probably comprehend more\nthan you may consciously think.\nAfter some practice, this new\nmethod of reading will become\nsecond nature, and should provide\nthe first positive signs of an ability\nto read quickly. Gradually, the\nlength of the jumps taken can be\nincreased and the time spent\npausing between leaps can be\nThejever snapped off/The^ship twisted j harp ly and rocketed upwards. The crew were hurled...\nie creased. Combined with the\nelimination of back-skipping, these\ntechniques can lead to considerable\nspeed increases.\nBACK-SKIPPING\nConscious back-skipping can be\navoided quite easily; even if\nyou think you haven't followed the author's argument\nover the last\nphrase/sentence/paragraph, DO\nNOT skip back to re-read it. You\nhave probably understood the\nsection fairly well - at least well\nenough to continue reading without\nhaving lost the thread. Studies have\nbeen made on this point with the\nresult that people who allow\nthemselves to back skip do not\nperform appreciably better than\nnon-back skippers in comprehension\ntests.\nUnconscious back skipping, by its\nvery nature, cannot be directly\nstopped. To eliminate this habit,\nreading speed must be increased to\nthe point where there is no time for\nthe eyes to wander round the page.\nSUBVOCALISATION\nSub vocal is ation 'speaking' the\ntext to yourself - derives from\nthe method used to teach\nreading to infants. In primary\nschool, we are taught first to 'read\nout loud', and then, when we get\na little bit older, we are told to 'read\nquietly to ourselves.' At this stage,\nthe action of speaking may be\nperformed by the mind, with the\nmouth still moving to form sounds.\nGradually the habit becomes\nsubconscious, though it usually\nremains into adulthood.\nThe habit of speaking text in your\nmind can slow down reading, but\nit is thought that it can never be\ncompletely dispelled - only pushed\nfurther into the subconscious. The\nfurther back it is pushed, the less\nintrusive it becomes, and so the\nfaster reading can be performed.\nSKIMMING\nSkimming means quickly\nlooking over a text to grasp the\ngeneral concepts being put\nacross. The related action of\nscanning is looking over text in\norder to find a particular point, or,\nin the case of many research papers,\nto find the end of the waf fly introduction and the start of the\nimportant section.\nBy skimming a text, as explained\nbelow under 'previewing', you\nautomatically gain some\nunderstanding, so that reading can\nproceed relatively quickly. Some\nauthorities even recommend flicking\nthrough an entire book, eye fixed on\nthe middle of the pages as they fly\npast, in order to be able to read it\nmore quickly! (Dunno whether I believe that 'un g uv.) Certainly,\npreviewing a text is well worth the\neffort.\nPARAGRAPHS\nParagraphs are, in a well written\npiece, assembled with a well-defined structure. The first\nsentence usually summarise s the\nrest of the paragraph or gives the\nnext topic of discussion. An\nexpansion of this topic follows, with\nthe final sentence sometimes linking\ninto the next topic to carry the\nreader through the text.\nWithin the overall structure of a text, the first and last paragraphs are\nby Steve Meyfroidt\nusually the most important; the first\ngiving a summary and the last a conclusion. However, the first 'real'\nparagraph may not be the first\nparagraph of a piece if the author\nfeels the need to begin with a helping of waffle. Magazine or\nnewspaper articles such as this are\nusually split into smaller paragraphs\nthan those found in books. In this\ncase, it may be the first three or four\nparagraphs that give a summary of\nthe text.\nPREVIEWING\nP reviewing a text, that is getting\na basic understanding of the\nideas to be presented, relies\nheavily on the writer's skill. First,\nthe title and any subtitles should be\nread to get a feel for the overall\nstructure. The first paragraph is\nthen read, followed by the first\nsentences of other paragraphs. At\nthis stage, you know the author's main points and are almost ready to\nbegin a first reading. First though,\nquickly skim the whole text, and\nthen start reading from the\nbeginning.\nWith practice, the whole\nprocedure will take less time, and\nlead to greater comprehension, than\nsimply ploughing your way through\nthe text from start to finish.\nCONCLUSION\nU sing the above techniques,\nand after some practice, you\nmay find your reading speed\nincreases by 400% or more. The\nimportant point to bear in mind is\nthat there is no miracle cure -practice is necessary, and the more\nyou practice, the faster you will\nbecome.\n// i/ ou are interested in the subject of\nspeed reading, I ivo ul d recommend\nSpeed Reading by Tony Buzan for\nfurther reading.\nJanuary 13 1989 FELIX Page 13\n\n"

A great deal more discussion of what\nare generally good ideas and\nimportant issues would be a step in\nthe right direction. Nigel D Person,\nall is forgiven.\nBill Goodwin\nBill suffers from one of two\nunfortunate problems either he is\ntoo nice a person or he is an out and\nout coward. I find the latter rather\nhard to believe considering his\noutspoken nature, a side of his\ncharacter we have not seen very\nmuch of last term. FELIX is an\nextremely important commodity in\nthe running of the College. It\nmanages to keep the system in\ncheck, keeps a large number of\npeople on their toes and reminds all\nof us that we are still human, we\nmake mistakes no matter how\nimportant we are.\nFELIX is here to spread news and\nkeep the public interested in the\nrunning of their own organisation;\na little bit of scandal is always good\nfor involvement. Its ability to point\nrumour and hearsay is also very\nimportant so long as it does not\ndamage someone's reputation. If\nrumour was not printed, then a number of people in very\nentrenched positions in College and\nthe Union would be able to get away\nwith anything. That little hint of fear\nthat it produces in everyone in\nCollege helps to stop outrageous\nthings happening.\nThis year Bill has failed to grab the\nbull by the horns and investigate\nstories to the embarrassment of\nthose concerned. It is my belief that\nBill has been too soft on too many\npeople, especially the sabbaticals. I am sure that in part this is a kickback produced by the over-zealous\nbehaviour of last year's Editor and\nthe legal wrangles she found herself\nin over libelous material printed in\nthese pages.\nBill has not had an easy time. He\nbroke the mould when he got the\njob and, having found his feet, he\nfinds an over-zealous President\nbreathing down his neck\nthreatening to rewrite everything in\nFELIX.\nThis is partly of his own making.\nIf he had not been so nice to these\npeople at the beginning of term over\nmatters such as the Union\nrefurbishment he would not have\nthe problem.\nBill has also put too much\nemphasis on being involved in\nevery area of the production of\nFELIX. True it does produce a good\nlooking FELIX, but does it produce\nand interesting read? I, for one,\nwould far prefer to read something\nthat intrigued me and made me\nwant to see next week's issue.\nThe FELIX Editor's job is to edit\nFELIX, not produce it almost single-handedly. A FELIX Editor must cut\nthe dross and print the scandal. Bill\nhas it the wrong way round.\nBill must learn to delegate to allow\nhimself more time to stick his nose\ninto other people's business and let\nthe students have his opinion in a revealing editorial that has been well\nresearched. This is what Bill is\nexcellent at.\nIan Morris\nIt is very hard to be critical of anyone\nin this job, as it is totally new. What\nis true of all the sabbaticals is that\nthey only have one year in which to\nachieve as much as possible before\nthey find themselves prematurely\ncut short.

As yet the Industrial\nRelations Committee has not been\nestablished, let alone met. It now\nhas a sizable budget, but no\nfinancial regulations under which to\nutilise this budget.\nUnder campaigns Ian is\nresponsible for the planned Human\nRights Week which first underwent\na drastic reduction in size and was\nthen scrapped altogether. This may\nbe due to the fact that it was\nun fe as able or that ULU hindered its\ndevelopment too severely last year,\nbut I believe it is because Ian Morris\nhas no interest in the subject matter.\nIan must realise that representing\nthe students means you must\nrepresent their desires whether you\nagree with them or not. On the\nother hand the Union Entertainments this year are running more\nregularly and successfully than in\nmany years gone by. The Charity\nMonopoly planned for the summer\nis being received enthusiastically by\nstudents and the outside world\nalike. The Union is looking at new\nforms of entertainment, recently the\nUnion Building has been unduly full\nof women and it looks as though a number of national sporting events\nwill generate their own TV parties\neven though Ian can't fit his new big\nscreen telly into the lift.\nAt the same time, Ian has donned\na white hat and silver plated 45s to\nbecome the students' hero taking up\nthe causes of student rents and\nstudent loans with considerable\neffect when his fellow sabbaticals\nhave all but ignored them.\nWe could see an outstanding year\nfrom Ian if he pays a little more\nattention to industrial relations\nrather than sexual relations!\nU.R.O.

    "content": "Felix\nEditorial\nThe state of the Union...\nAt the beginning of this year I could honestly say that it had the potential to be one of the best\nyears the students' Union has ever seen. Now, at the beginning of the second term I am struck\nby the realisation that I was completely wrong.\nThe fate which has beset this year's Union is one that has been responsible for the failure of\nnumerous Union administrations in the past; it is the obsession of the individuals within the Union\nwith their own self importance.\nThe Union finds itself with a President who feels the need to be in complete control of everything\nwithin the Union; he prefers not to accept help or advice and likes to give the impression that\nthe other Sabbaticals are in some way subservient to him.\nIt is sometimes easy to forget that the Union is not controlled by the President, or for that matter\nany of the other Sabbaticals. The Sabbaticals are here to act on behalf of the students; they were\nelected by the students to represent their views, and when it comes down to it, it is the students\nwho should control their Union. And the vehicle for this control is the Union General Meeting.\nIt is ironic then, that the Union is adopting a policy of keeping UGMs as short as possible and\nthat there are rumours about abolishing UGMs altogether in a move designed to appease St Mary's Medical School.\nI remember reading the following statement in Nigel Baker's election publicity; 'One side of Union\nlife which has saddened me this year is the seemingly incessant internal bickering between the\nUnion Office and FELIX. Everyone in Beit Quad is on the same side...' I would like to think so.\nYet while the Union Office expects FELIX to bend over backwards to help them publicise events\nand do their printing work for them they are not prepared to put anything back into FELIX. Far\nfrom it; they have treated FELIX very shabbily indeed for a whole term.\nFor example, there was the time when Nigel Baker and the other Union Officers decided they'd much rather get drunk in the Union Bar than help collate FELIX on the occasion when we had\nno one to collate. There was the Alcohol Awareness supplement which FELIX put together to\nsupport the Union Alcohol Awareness Week. Nigel promised lots of colla tors to help put the insert\nand Exec News in what was a larger than average edition; none turned up and five very depressed\nFELIX staff ended staying up until 3.30am to ensure that FELIX came out. There was the motion\nwhich the Union put through Council shortly after Pub Board had finally agreed on a workable\narrangement for dealing with external income which in one swoop invalidated all that we had\nworked so hard to achieve. And the list goes on.\nI do not think that FELIX has been scathing or unfair in its criticism of the Union. On the contrary\nI think it has been too kind.\nYet while our Union President likes to dismiss FELIX as something which is read for half an\nhour and then thrown away, he gets very worked up about every turn of phrase in every news\nstory or editorial that mentions his name. So incensed is he that he would dearly desire \u2022 if only\nhe had the guts to go through with it - to take the FELIX Editor to a UGM and call for a vote of\nno confidence, but he knows deep down that such a call would be very quickly thrown out.\nThere, there Nigel, never mind.\nThe Union's latest-move is to set up a committee to look into 'the standard of FELIX. 'Oh sorry\nBill, we were going to tell you about it but we forgot.'\nWhat followed were a series of petty complaints: for example charging Guilds for an advert\nwhich they eventually got free of charge (Oh Gawd I'm so sorry); not folding and collating Guildsheet\n(surely this is the job the Guildsheet editors); having to reprint a job which went wrong; and sending\nsomeone an incorrect invoice (bloody hell what an catastrophe). Of course none of the people\ninvolved had thought about bringing these things to the attention of the Print Unit Manager - myself.\nCome on Nigel, what does your little Committee really expect to find ?\n'\u2022\u2022 \u2022 vi at' s next on the cards ? 'Why don't we take the Print Unit out of FELIX.' Well, because\ni,rt LiX didn't have a Print Unit there would be no FELIX.\nWhat it all boils down to, of course, is the Union's dislike of a newspaper which is free to print\nwhat it likes i.e. the truth, because the truth can often be disconcerting. It keeps the Union on\nits toes; it means that Union officers can not get away with doing nothing; it brings egotistical\nUnion Officers back down to the ground. To quote from a predecessor of mine; 'without its\nnewspaper IC Union is a festering heap of ego maniacs.'

They were\nbitching about the rest of the\nPHALLIX staff and the fact that they\nnever finished collating before half\npast three.\n'Bloody Hell,' said Willhebe\nGood-for a column inch, as he\nshuffled into the Print Room, 'they\nweren't around in Rabid Bones'\nyear.'\n'Bloody Hell,' said PHALLIX\nBusybody, Dizzy Lizzy, as she hung\non to his arm.\n'Oh, isn't it a nice day?' said\nWinthrop Cravat, as he trundled\nafter Dizzy Lizzy, who was\ndesperately trying to get rid of him\nso that she could be alone with\nWillhebe at last.\nBack in the Citizens' Office, Chas\nPianoplayer hid under a desk as\nSydney Spanker (brain changed in\naid of comic relief) flounced in.\nSpanker was Meeja Committee\nStool and was anxious to find out\nwhat had happened at the last\nMeeja Committee, which he'd missed because a sequin had fallen\noff his favourite dress.\n\"They took it out of contingency,'\nsnapped Little Lord Patacake.\n'Oh, right,' said Spanker, as he\nmade his way towards Mrs Jolly\nHockey-Sticks.\n'Never mind, de a rie, 'she said,\n'have a glass of sherry and let's talk\nabout the good old days when you\nwere Chief Citizen.'\n'They took it out of contingency,'\nsaid Littic Lord Patacake, as he burst\nin on the scene.\nSe'.:nj; span ker's puzzled look,\nwhich was slightly different from his\nusual confused look, Mrs Jolly\nHockt Sticks leaned across and\nwhispered in his ear, 'They're\ntaking the money for a leaving party\nfor the Meeja Committee Head\nMoney Counter out of contingency.'\nShe sat back and sipped her\nsherry appreciatively.\n'Oh, excellent,' said Spanker, 'it's about time too!'\n'But, but, but...,' said Little Lord\nPatacake, and slunk back to sulk in\nhis office.\nChas Pianoplayer emerged from\nunderneath his desk.

    "content": "THE J km,^ \u00a3 R OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION Protest Against Government 'Loans Scheme' Continues\nI.C.U. Plans Lobby of Parliament\nImperial College students' union\nhave planned a lobby of Parliament\nnext Thursday as part of the\ncontinuing protest against the\nGovernment's 'Top-Up loans for\nstudents scheme.' The action will\ninvolve a large number of IC\nstudents gathering at parliament to\ntalk to, and in some cases present\nletters to their own local MPs\nstressing what they see as the\npitfalls of the loans scheme.\nIC Union president, Nigel Baker,\npresented the ideas for the lobby to\nthe college's governing body who\nwere described by the Rector, Eric\nAsh, as being \"sympathetic to the\ncritique of the plans.\" The Rector\nhas written to the heads of all\ncollege departments supporting\nNigel Baker's requests that a cancellation or rescheduling of\nlectures for that afternoon might be\neffected. Nigel Baker is also in the\nprocess of visiting 65 per cent of\ncollege department years to explain\nthe plans and a simple 'show-of-hands' vote has been conducted in\neach case to determine the number\nof students willing to boycott\nThursday afternoon lectures for the\nlobby, should their department not\nagree to a change in time-table. In\nall cases so far the majority vote has\nbeen in favour of a boycott.\nA petition has been drafted by the\nunion which states that \"the\nundersigned believe that the\nintroduction of student loans will be\ndetrimental to the future of higher\neducation and that the loan\nproposals put forward by this\ngovernment should be withdrawn.\"\nCopies of this have been circulated\naround all college departments and\nthe union believes that it will receive\n\"a significantly large number of\nsignatures.\"\nAt 1 pm on Thursday Mr Peter\nBrook, MP for Westminster South,\nis due to address the college on the\nissue of student loans. As a Conservative MP he will be\nemphasising the government's argument on the issue. The address\nwill involve a large amount of time\nset aside for questions, will take\nplace in the Great Hall and will\ninclude the presentation of the\ncollege-wide petition to Mr Brook by\nNigel Baker.\nAt 2 pm Nigel Baker will make a short speech stressing the aims of\nthe lobby and the mode of action to\nbe taken.\nLater that afternoon the students\ninvolved will gather at the Houses\nof Parliament. There will be no\nmarch, so the plans pose no risk of\narrest as witnessed at the NUS\nmarch on 24th November last year.\nThe President hopes that many\nstudents will have prepared letters\nto their MPs briefly stressing the\nargument against loans and\nrequesting that the MPs meet\nrepresentatives of the students'\nunion and pass on their concerns to\nSecretary of State for Education, Mr.\nKenneth Baker.\nThe action will be followed by\nanother march on 1st February\norganised by NUS London which IC\nstudents' union will be supporting.\nStudents will march from Finsbury\nCircus through the city to\nShoreditch Park.\nConference\nOffice\nRe-shuffle\nThe Conference Office has been\nreorganised this holiday, following\nthe resignation of the Cc -ference\nOfficer, Miss Gill Davies.\nRefectories Manager, Mr Rob\nNorthey, has now taken\nresponsibility for conferences. He\nwill oversee the catering himself and\nwork with Loretto O 'Callaghan to\norganise the ac como dati on. Mr Northey told FELIX that the\nplans for the change were initiated\nbefore he started his job 3-4 years\nago, and that the job has always\nbeen in his contract, but the Rector,\nEric Ash, was keen to stress that\nMiss Davies has 'not left because of\nany tension at all, but because she\nfelt she would like a new job after\nbeing here for a number of years.'\n1 3 JAN1988 New London College\nOne of the most deprived inner-city\nareas of London is to be the site of\nthe first new college in London for\n15 years which is due to open its\ndoors by January 1990. The new\nFurther Education College will\ninitially be based at the Arbour\nSquare and Jubilee Street premises\nof the City and East London College\nand at Hackney College's Poplar\nCentre. A new extension is to be\nbuilt on which work has already\nstarted. The plans have been\nreceived with great enthusiasm by\nthe London Education Business\nPartnership and the East End Local\nEmployer Network, but were\ndescribed by a spokesman from the\nDepartment of Education and\nScience as 'simply renaming\nexisting parts of Hackney College'.\nThe plans were sum it ted by Tower\nHamlets Borough Council in a scheme set up to involve individual\nboroughs in education as the\nExtension work for the new college starts\nabolition of the Inner London\nEducation Authority (ILEA) moves\ninto action.

    "content": "Opinion\nview\nFrom\nView from a Bridge is a series of\nopinion articles by the 1987-88\nUnion President about life at\nCollege; the rights and wrongs of\nhow it is run, the personalities\nwithin it and its future within the\nBritish education system.\nThis series does not intend to pull\nany punches, it will annoy a number of people, especially those\nwho deserve it, but also a number\nof the author's friends. It will\ndoubtlessly damage the author's relationship with the College and\nthe Union and two of the articles\nmay in fact affect his degree result.\nThe material within the series is\nsolely the opinion of the author and\ndoes not represent facts unless they\nare implicit ely stated to be so.\nIf you have any desire to write in\nresponse to these articles, please do\nso but remember that it may be\nwise to ask for the Editor to\nwithhold your name from the letter.\nThe author does not intend to reply\nto any letters written regarding\nprevious articles but is interested to\nhear other people's opinions.\nNige! Baker\nAlthougii the best candidate for the\njob at the time beating his 'joke\ncandidate' opponent by a vast\nmajority and showing all the\npotential to be an extremely good\nleader of the Union, Nigel Baker\nappears to think he is the Union.\nThe megalomania virus which\nappears to have taken control of our\nPresident has resulted in him\nforgetting who put him in office and\nwho can oust him if they're not\nsatisfied. Mr -Baker informs his\nCouncil of his actions rather than\nasking their opinion in advance. He\nappears to take advice from very\nfew people and rarely frater n is es with students.\nThe Union Office is run as an\nefficient new package with a marvelous wrapping of bureaucracy\nall tied up in pretty red tape. New\n'self help' schemes have been\nestablished; 'you want a minibus,\nwell what do you expect me to do,\npull one out of a hat? Here's a telephone directory, go and find one\nyourself.\nOne student who had a complaint\nabout a Union trading outlet was\nsent to a random location in College;\nthis new procedure was called\n'passing the buck'. The Office now\ncloses at 5.30pm with no exceptions,\nDiplomat Extraordinaire, Sydney Harbour-Bridge\naddresses the United Nations on the subject of\nthis year's sabbaticals.\nMr Baker seems to have forgotten\nthat most students are timetabled\nuntil 5.30pm. My belief was that the\nUnion was there to provide a service\nfor the students to help them find\ntheir way through the jungle of\nbureaucracy th own up by College\nand London life and not to provide\na training ground for up-and-coming bureaucrats.\nNigel often treats his Deputy\nPresident with contempt, ridiculing\nhim in front of staff and students\nwhilst obscuring much of the\nUnion's work from him. There is\nvery little doubt in my mind that\nmuch of the lack of action on the\npart of the DP is due a distinct\nabsence of encouragement from his\npeers.\nSo what has Nigel D Baker done\nthis for? Well so far Nigel's aim of\nhaving an Office with as few\nstudents in it as possible has not in\nfact encouraged anyone to take up\nthe posts of Welfare Officer or\nExternal Affairs Officer and as a result much of his time has been\nspent in Welfare.\nThis year the Welfare Committee\nhas not been called, even though it\nis bound by its articles to meet at\nleast once a term, nevertheless Nigel\nhas managed to spend a large\nquantity of that Committee's budget\non a series of campaigns and a questionnaire for which expenditure\nwas not authorised by any\ncommittee. Furthermore, he has\nmanaged to appoint a Welfare\nAdviser at almost double the cost of\nthe one that left, negotiating a lucrative deal with College that cost\nthe Union a sizeable society room\nand around \u00a37,000 a year ad\ninfinitum.\nNigel has also worked in the area\nof accommodation, where it appears\nhe has rubbed a number of the\nCollege wardens up the wrong way.\nIt is what Nigel has not done that\nreally demonstrates the potential of\nthe man in national party politics.\nStill on the matter of accommodation, Nigel managed to totally\nignore the complaints regarding rent\nlevels emanating from the queue of\nstudents outside his office. It was\nnot until a bemused student fell\nthrough Ian Morris' door thinking\nit was the way out and explained\nthat there was a brick wall sitting in\nthe President's chair that something\neventually got done.\nThe topic of Athletics poses the\nquestion of why the President\nignored a paper passed by Council\nlast year aimed at defining the\nUnion's ownership of Harlington\nSports Ground, the three million\npound gravel fund and certain other\nfacilities, whilst allowing a totally\ndifferent constitution to go all but\nunquestioned at the Athletics\nCommittee.\nThe External Affairs Committee\nhas not yet met this year even\nthough we have seen the onset of\nthe student loans scheme, a commit t ment from the Union to\nbecome involved in the 1990 Council\nelections and the fact that it is bound\nto meet three times a term.\nThe situ t ation concerning the\nmerger with the Union at St Mary's seems to have deteriorated further\nfollowing Nigel calling the St Mary's President 'a big fish in a small pond'\nand a merger now looks unlikely for\nat least a year.\nWe must ask why our President\nhas not acted decisively concerning\nstudent loans and the effect it will\nhave on this College? Why did he\nsupport the ULU President who was\nin favour of many of the present\nGovernment's policies on education\nand why is he not acting as he\nagreed, in an aim to oust Tory\nCouncillors from the local Council\nto aid College planning permission?\nPerhaps his personal politics are\nhindering his ability to represent his\nstudents fully?\nAt the same time deep down\nNigel is a hard working, dedicated\nand extremely capable Union\nPresident, whom I once would have\nconsidered a good friend.

    "content": "Dead Ringers The Mantle Twins are\ninseparable. Elliot and Beverly are\ntheir names. From the off they\ntake identical paths to\ngynaecology practise, starting at\nan early age with grisly toy\noperating equipment, continuing\nthrough medical school,\nculminating in a joint specialist\nsurgery in Toronto.\nBev has always been the\nstudious type. Elly is rit her more\nflamboyant. They pi ' a ea me of\ndeception as on lv identical twins\ncould, each using his own\ncharisma and persona to achieve\nwhat both want. Together they\nform one complete entity.\nFrench-Canadian actress Claire\nBiveau stumbles into their lives.\n'Tell me about my uterus' she\ndemands over dinner, and so\nbegins a love tangle destined to\ndisrupt the happy existence the\nbrothers have.\nBeverly falls in love. The\nwoman provides and ir resist able comfort despite, or perhaps\nbecause of, her extraordinary mix\nof strangeness (T need to be\nspanked. I'm bad'). It is solace\naway from Elly though and thus\nthe wedge is driven in.\nFor the first time in their lives\nMoon walker The magic of the cinema and the\nmagic of Michael Jackson combine\nto blast the movie audiences of\nthe world with a musical and\nvisual feast, interlaced with\nenough supreme acting to collect\nevery Oscar imaginable and one\nor two you've probably forgotten\nall about.\nWell...that constitutes\nsomething of an exaggeration. It\nwould be more accurate perhaps\nto say that Moonwalker is a string\nof videos vaguely attached to each\nother by a bemusing storyline of\nst up if ying simplicity.\nSit back and enjoy the journey\ninto Michael's mind. By all means\ntap your foot to the boogie-woogie tunes but don't ignore the\npoint (points, there are several) of\nthis film.\nAn opening sequence of video\nclips imparts a retrospective of the\nmusical life which we know so\nwell already. The first lesson we\nare presented with is that Michael\na separation occurs. The anger,\nconfusion and madness which\nensues slowly tears them apart.\nThe twins are played by Jeremy\nIrons (The Mission, Brideshead\nRevisited). He does the job\nwonderfully showing a diversity\nand competence which marks the\nreal ability of the man.\nGenevieve Bujoid (Coma,\nTightrope) though headlining with\nIrons never shows more than a supporting role. She is completely\noutshone by the leading man and\nthe technical accomplishment.\nOn the surface Dead Ringers is\nis absolutely fed up of being\nchased.\nIn fact this becomes a motif of\nthe movie as we see a repetition\nof chase sequences. Firstly\nthrough a parody of Roger Rabbit's Maroon Toon Studios, where all\nthe speaking parts are taken by\npeople in outrageous plastic\nmasks, perhaps in an attempt to\nmake Mr Jackson's look more\nhuman.\nLater we have hot pursuit\nthrough a topsy-turvey world\nreminiscent of Batman's Gotham\nCity. In amongst, just to hammer\nthe message home, is a new song\nLeave Me Alone accompanied by a video of the style favoured by\nPrince and Monty Python. This\nstatement of irritation at the\nhounding received from the press\nis one of two high points in the\nfilm.\nThe other is the video sequence\nfor Smooth Criminal, which gives\nfirst airing to the next message.\nMichael it seems has no objection\nat all to gratuitous violence if it's against the baddies and well\nchoreographed.\nAnother one of the pop guru's ideologies is that drugs are bad.\nNow here's a moral stance\nworthy of some vinyl and a glossy\nThe taxi has arrived.\na thriller dealing in relationships\nand the depths of closely related\npsychologies. Beneath are one or\ntwo lessons, if you care to look.\nIt is Bev, the scholar, who sees\nall things in black and white, with\nno understanding of his brother's feelings during his period with\nClaire. Although his life collapses\nmore dramatically when he loses\nthe girl it is he who copes\nsubstantially better when all\nevents within his experience fall\ninto boxes which he may label.\nConversely Elly follows a volatile lifestyle which is\npromo but this instead turns out\nto be just the obligatory narrative.\nIt does allow some further\nshooting and killing and leads to\nthe most fundamental revelation\nyet. Michael Jackson is, in fact, a spaceship. More than that he is\nthat annual Christmas favourite,\na Transformer. His alter egos are\nRobocop and a sports car, his\nclever disguise is that of\nover talented mega star, this time\nwithout sequined glove and\nsporting designer finger bandages\ninstead.\nMicnael zaps the bad die and\nflies off into space, only to be hit\nby a shooting star.\nAnd as sadness descends on\nthe house and we mourn our\nhero's departure a tiny voice\nassures us that happiness will\nprevail. Our final lesson is that if\nyou wish on a star you too could\nfind yourself at a Michael Jackson\nconcert.\nUltimately it's just another\nninety minute music video. While\nRattle and Hum is merely offering\na chance to relive the full glory of\na U2 concert, Moonwalker gives a ringside seat in Jackson's imagination. As you explore this\nrealm you begin to wonder\nexactly how you got here, though\ndestroyed only when his most\nfundamental ingredient is\nremoved.\nIgnore these subtleties of\ncharacter if you wish. Dead Ringers\nopens a touch slowly but remains\ncompelling viewing. It is both\ntense and sad, distinguishing it\nfrom director Cronenberg's previous snuff movies, Scanners,\nThe Fly, etc.\nThis is not the most cheerful\nmovie on release, but it is worth\na visit just the same.\nAndrew Clarke\nnot necessarily where the exit is.\nI left feeling a little perplexed\nand worried that Michael Jackson\nmight actually believe all this\ni stuff. Someone tell him please.\n[ Andrew Clarke.\nMan, Machine or\ni Michael?\nJanuary 13 1989 FELIX Page 17\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nCommon Theft\n(or how to make crime pay)\nA special feature all about Mascotry, who does it, who doesn't, why,\nwhere and when and with a number of rather amusing photographs\nand a comprehensive list of all those humourous ly named objects.\nFollowing last term's return of\nSpanner and Bolt (C&G mascots) to\nthem by the RCS, and all that it\nentailed, we thought you might like\nto know some of the history behind\nthe whole idea of Mascotry, how it\narose, how it works and what its\nraison d'e tre is.\nDefinition\nMascotry is: 'The practice of keeping\none's own mascot safe from theft\nfrom a rival college, while at the\nsame time stealing another college's mascot to ransom back to them for\nRag.'\nMascotry began as 'one up man ship '\u2014almost every college in the\ncountry used to have a mascot of\none form or another\u2014and from the\nlate thirties it was used as a way of\ndemonstrating your college's superiority over someone else's. Back in the days when over 500\nstudents would gather for the\nMorphy Day battle on Putney\ntowpath and stunts such as painting\nfootsteps down the side of the\nQueen's Tower were commonplace,\ninter-college rivalry throughout the\nnation was very strong.\nSymbols representing individual\ncolleges arose as their mascots and\nthese ranged-'from stuffed tapirs\nthrough concrete carrots to Nelson's Column. It became common\npractice to run off with say, King's lion (Reggie), remove its genitalia\nwith a hammer and chisel and then\nleave it for them to find in a dung\nheap. As far as we can tell, the only\nreasons for this would be that it\ncaused a lot of hassle (what with\nhaving to make a new brass pecker\nfor your lion and then weld it on!)\u2014\nand some might say that this would\nbe reason enough. Eventually some\nbright spark had the idea that you\ncould ransom back a mascot in order\nto raise money for Rag and this is\nreally where the story starts.\nAs you may or may not know,\nImperial currently has a large\nselection of mascots. These are:\nMike the Micrometer\nICU's mascot since 1966. Mike was\nbuilt to replace the previous\nmascots\u2014originally Herbert (a cast\nmetal Phoenix who was stolen by a teacher training college when two of\ntheir girl students seduced their way\ninto the Herbert bearer's flat, got\nthem drunk and made off with the\nmascot), then a lamppost and finally\nthe Queen's Tower. Mike was\ndesigned and calibrated in RCS, cast\nfrom spent rifle cartridges in RSM\nand machined in C&G. He weighs\n1701bs, is 4ft long and has had a very\nchequered history, being stolen\nfrom his display plinth MARIA\n(Mascot Anti Raiding Interference\nAlarm) shortly after his creation by\nQMC who used pneumatic drills to\nremove him.\nTheta\nThe mascot of RCSU, a7ft long\nrepresentation of a thermometer\nmade from hydraulic pipe and a stainless steel bulb. This version is\nMk 4, inaugurated in 1975, and has\nnever been stolen by another\ncollege. The original Theta was\nchristened in 1958 and was made\nfrom a ball cock stuck on to a broom handle. Previously, RCSU\nhad a drum which they used to\nannounce their presence at\nBarnights, Rag events etc etc. Theta\nMk2 went walk ies from the Physics\ndepartmental office in October 1969\nand was never seen again. Version\n3 emerged in 1970 and consisted of\n2 litres of lead cast on to the end of\nas caff bar. The most in gene o us theft\nof Theta was from the Maths\nFreshers' Dinner in 1964 when a Guildsman dressed up as a waitress\nsnatched Mkl from the top table\nand legged it down the back stairs\nin Southside with the whole Dinner\nin hot pursuit (see photo).\nDavey\nDavey is, in fact, RSM's third\nmascot. Firstly they had a plastic\nMichelin man called Mitch who rode\nwith them on the original\nClementine (a traction engine). Next\ncame Davey Mkl, an incredibly\nheavy miner's lamp lookalike in\nRSM's colours of yellow and black.\nIn later years, after the creation of\nthe current Davey, Mk2, (fashioned\nin an odi sed aluminium and brass\nand certainly the prettiest of all the\nmascots) RSM used to use Davey\nMkl as a decoy to deceive any\npotential 'thieves' by carrying both\nversions into and out of their UGMs\nin bin liners so no one ever knew\nwhether they were chasing the real\nDavey or not. A few years ago,\nDavey Mkl went missing from the\nMines office where it was being\nused as a doors top and ended up in\nthe Physics level 1 common room\nbehind a wood panel. From there,\nit disappeared and has sadly never\ncome to light. In one episode of\nDavey's life, two RCS men spent 18\nmonths tracking down where he\nwas stored in RSM by hiding in\ncupboards after RSM UGM's and\nlistening out for the Davey Bearers\ngoing by. Eventually they narrowed\ndown the location of the mascot to\none particular storeroom in the\nbasement and hid behind a filing\ncabinet just outside as Davey was\nput away. Later that night they\nreturned with hacksaws, hammers,\ndrills and bolt cutters, picked the\nlock to the room and demolished the\nonly cupboard therein which was\nDavey'shide y hole. Spanner and Bolt\nIn order to protect Bo Mk 1 (C&G's original veteran car) from harm by\nother colleges, the Bo driver used to\nthreaten them with the biggest\nspanner in the toolbox. Over the\nyears, as Bo became more valuable,\nGuild's mascot changed to being a large Spanner instead. Several\nSpanners have existed, the first was\nlost to Kings, the second broke\nwhen sat on by a Guildsman just\nafter being recovered from being\nburied in Putney towpath and the\nthird they have now. Bolt is a fairly\nnew acquisition by comparison, but\nquite nicely made in the traditional\nstyle (ie bloody heavy!). RCS have\njust handed back S&B to Guilds\nfollowing their removal from the\nboot of a car last March. This was\nthe first inter-CCU mascot ry that\nhas been played fairly for a very\nlong time, with RCS designing a Treasure Hunt for the Guildsmen to\nPage 8 FELIX January 13 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Travel\nBOOKS\nThe inter-rail er's bible is \"Europe by\nTrain\" by Katie Wood and George\nMcDonald, which seems to be\nupdated every year in March. The\nbook covers every country in\nEurope with short notes on what to\nsee and all the information a budget\ntraveller might want. Books on\nindividual countries might also be\na good idea, and phrase books for\nthose wishing to converse with the\nnatives.\nA good rail timetable is invaluable;\nit is surprising what weird and\nwonderful routes can be discovered\nin one of these. It is also possible to\nsave considerable time being able to\nplan ahead, rather than turning up\nat a station and hoping for a train.\nManv countries in Europe do not\nrun services between major cities\nthat are as frequent as British Rail's services. British Rail publishes a European Timetable which is cheap,\nbut only covers direct journeys from\nLondon. The best choice is the\nThomas Cook European Timetable\nthat is published every month; it is\navailable from Thomas Cook shops\nat \u00a34.95, and a rail map of Europe\nwill cost \u00a33.15.\nACCOMMODATION\nCheap accommodation can be hard\nto find in Europe, especially in the\nheight of summer. The cheapest\noption is camping, but you have to\ncarry a tent etc around with you all\nholiday. Most cities have campsites\non the outskirts; be careful, some\ncountries insist that one stays in\nofficial campsites only. Next on the\nprice scale come Youth Hostels.\nEurope is littered with them; all you\nhave to do is join the YHA in this\ncountry and attach a photo to your\ncard. A book detailing all the youth\nhostels in Europe is available from\nthe YHA. However, the rather strict\nrules may put many people off\nYouth Hostels; the further south\nyou get, the more lax the rules.\nAnother alternative in Southern\nEurope is the en sion, a small, family\nrun hotel that can sometimes be as\ncheap as a Youth Hostel. Apart from\nthat, cheap hotels are the only\nalternative, and prices begin to get\nsteep at this point.\n...AND\nDon't take too much luggage - you\nalways end up with clothes you\ndon't need. Also, remember that\nvo u will want to bring back\npresents, booze etc. from Europe, so\nleave room in your bag for these\nthings. It is easy to buy detergent to\nwash clothes, and many youth\nhostels and campsites will have\nfacilities to wash clothes.\nAn ISIC card is useful for\nreductions in museums and on\ncoaches. The tourist agencies of the\nEuropean countries in London will\nbe only too happy to load you down\nwith piles of pretty leaflets full of\nphotos of their country, and, more\nimport a it lv, maps of the major\ncities. And remember, enjoy\nyourself!\nTO ISTANBUL BY THE\nSIMPLON ORIENT\nDay 1: Boarded the Dover to Calais\nferry at midnight to make the best\nuse of the month inter-railing. From\nCalais, took the 5am train to Paris,\ngrabbing a few hours of sleep. Spent\nthe day in Paris, climbing the Eiffel\ntower and checking out the Louvre.\nIn the evening boarded the Simplon\nOrient for Venice, camembert and\nwine in hand, and stretched out on\nthe seats for the night.\nDay 2 : Woken at 4am by a family\nof Italians going on h oil day, the\nwhole family left little room in the\ncompartment for us. A day trip to\nVenice was abandoned when we\nmissed the station, so carried on to\njoined us.\nDay 4 : At 4am Salonica station is\nnot pleasant. Rescued my\ncompanion from the tracks - he had\ndecided to sleep there. Boarded the\ntrain for Istanbul at 9am, and\ncrashed out. Woke at noon to find\nmy companion had started a party\nwith the remains of the Ouso. Spent\nthe day sandwiched between\nsmoking Greek peasants, reaching\nthe border in the evening.

On the train again in the\nevening and into Yugoslavia, where\nthey took the train apart at the\nborder.\nDav 3 : Arrived in Belgrade around\nlunchtime - Belgrade doesn't have\nmuch to recommend it except the\nSlimovitch. Carried on to the Greek\nborder, where a bottle of Ouso\ntrain left the carriage in the middle\nof nowhere for three hours while\nthe border guards collected the\n: passports and then held a lottery\nwith them.
