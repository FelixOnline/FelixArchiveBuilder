    "content": "ELETTERS\nOUR Carnivalpoos\nDear Fe/ix ipo os, Darling, just a quick note to let you know\nabout the Guilds Carnival. Rumour has it\nthat it's taking place tonight, not that I want\nto get you all excited for nothing, knowing\nyour little ways. I did hear, dearest\nhoney puff, that a little bandy w andy called\nMud are going to be playing, and that dear\nlittle group Rent Party that we both just loved\nso much at the Freshers' Ball, and even more,\ngosh I'm all out of breath, you shouldn't tickle so, yes, now do you remember those\ndelightful girls called the Gymslips singing\nsongs about drinking, and those awful boys\nthe Milkshakes?\nOf course this is all pure supposition, I mean it all sounds too good to me. I mean we\nboth know, don't we darling, that Mud are all\nin hospital having major surgery to try and\nremove their sunglasses, which haven't been\nmoved in four hundred years. And the\nMilkshakes are probably too tired having just\nreleased four albums in one week.\nOh so do come, dearest Felixipoos, it\nsounds ever so much fun, what with two\ndiscos and their cute little DJs, Andy Pandy\nand Freddy Weddy, and such a lovely little\nbarbeque, and all those cocktails made by\nthose gorgeous hunk y Links boys, and dear\nsweet little Brianipoos with his coloured\nlights flashing all over the place, and all those\nwonderful people wandering about having\nsuch a good time, oh it will be such fun.\nOh and by the way, the doors open at 8pm, the bar stays open until 2am and at the end of\nthe night two films, 'Altered States' and\n'Love and Death' will be shown for those of\nyou who manage to stay up for that long, and\nthe whole event only costs you \u00a33.50, which\nsounds like a good deal indeed, eh Dad? Yes\nson.\nLove from\nCharlywarly, Daviepoos, and all their little\nplaymates.\nWellsoc Bores\nDear Sir,\nWe, the remaining members of the Wellsoc\ncommittee would like to reply to an item\npublished in last week's FELIX, regarding\nthe resignations of the society's vice-chairman, W Hooper, social secretary, F Alii, and publicity officer, Dave Clements.\nFirst it should be pointed out that Miss Alii\nand Mr Clements had already made it known\nto the rest of the committee for some time\nthat they would be resigning thier positions\ntowards the end of this term due to'pressures\nof work' and 'other commitments'. The vice\nchairman, W Hooper, however gave no\nnotice of his resignation, either to the\nchairman N Maxwell, or to the rest of the\ncommittee, who were not informed of this\nturn of events prior to reading the article in\nFELIX. The letter on which this article was\nbased, I might add, was dated November 16\n1984, and not delivered to the chairman until\nafter FELIX had been issued. FELIX must\nhave received this letter some time before.\n(Sigh. Another scoop, Ed.)\nFor the former vice-chairman to embark\non such a course of action, he obviously\nconsiders himself to be exempt from his own\ndemand that any proposed activity by a committee member should be discussed in\ndetail and approved by the committee; even\nthough the ideal opportunity arose at the last\nmeeting for him to declare his intentions in\nthe regretted absence of the chairman.\nWith reference to the contents of the letter,\nthe three protagonists claimed that they were\nthe victims of an 'unconstitutional vendetta'\ndirected by the rest of the committee. Perhaps\nif Messrs Hooper and Clements had not\nadopted such self-righteous attitudes in\naddressing the rest of the committee they\nwould not have given us cause for complaint. The chairman is always willing to enter\ninto 'sensible discussion' on any aspect\nconcerning the society; discussion which the\nresigning vice chairman persistently tried to\ncurb, in order to reduce the duration of\ncommittee meetings. We wonder which of\nthese two attitudes our members consider to\nbe more beneficial to the functioning of the\nsociety.\nWe also find it hard to believe the further\nclaim that 'the society is being mismanaged\nby the chairman', when only one week\npreviously the publicity officer congratulated\nthe committee on its efforts, which have\nmade Wellsoc the second largest society in\nCollege, with a membership already\nexceeding that amassed in total last year.\nSuccess of this magnitude seems\nincompatible with this claim.\nWe would like to ensure (sic) our members\nthat the remaining committee is perfectly\nstrong and sound, and that the running of\nWellsoc will in no way be impaired by the loss\nof the three people in question. We already\nhave a potential replacement publicity\nofficer, and interest has been shown in the\nother posts; although formal elections will be\nheld. MONDAY NIGHT IS STILL\nWELL SOC NIGHT! The action taken by the former committee\nmembers is viewed as being extremely\nirresponsible, and harmful to the society that\nthey supposedly had in their best interests\n(sic). At the least (sic) it epitomizes the\nthoroughly negative attitude shown by them\n(the former social secretary excluded) to the\nwork of the rest of the committee, who have\nevery confidence in the chairman.\nYours faithfully\nMichael P Newman\nC Warral (Ordinary Member)\nPeter J Chase (Membership Sec)\nM Preen (Treasurer)\nH Parry (Audio Visual)\nJ Curtis\nFELIX 'In Sir Keith Joseph we once again have U Secretary of State for Education who as a man thinks deeply about the purposes of\neducation, and as a politician is determined\nto improve its quality'.\nThus spoke the Rector at Commemoration\nDay last month. In the light of the grants cuts\nrecently announced by Sir Keith, these, in\nhindsight, seem strange words from the\nRector.\nIn theory, at least, the essence of the\nproposed change is this: richer parents will be\nexpected to pay more for their children's education than poorer parents.\nThe money saved by these cuts will be used\nto increase the university equipment grant for\nresearch, and in the science vote itself.\nAt first sight this seems an equitable way of\nachieving the change, and it seems out of\ncharacter for the NUS to be the champion of\nhugely wealthy parents. The Government\nmust be rubbing its hands in glee.\nBut there is a serious problem with placing\nan increased burden on parents; some of\nthem, perhaps even most of them, won't pay-up their full contribution.\nThis makes the means-tested grant a nonsense. The hundreds of bureaucratic\nhours spent 'testing our parents means' are\nwasted if our parents don't have any\nintention of paying-up.\nThis is not to point to parents as the villains\nof the piece. The means-test is notoriously\ninequitable and many parents simply can't afford their full contribution.\nThe means-tested grant, whether before or\nafter Sir Keith's changes, is a monstrous\ndinosaur, indefensible despite the attempts of\nthe NUS.\nThe Government realise this, and they will\nabolish the means-tested grant before long.\nThey see the student grant as the least\ndefensible part of their education spending.\nAnd if the NUS persist in defending the\npresent system the cuts will continue\nunabated. Let them rather come up with a credible alternative.\nAeknowledgemnts: Special thanks this week to\nthe photographers Nigel and Pete, Hugh,\nHugh, Martin, Grenville, Richard, Andy,\nDiana ,Ajah, Patrick, Finian, Rosemary, Tony,\nall the colla tors and anyone else who has\nhelped.\nFelix is published by the Editor for and on behalf of\nImperial College Union Publications Board and is printed\nby the Union Print Unit, Imperial College, PrinceConsort\nRoad, London SW7.\nTelephone 01-589 511 1 Ext 3515\nEditor: David Rowe, Business Manager: Martin Taylor,\nAdvertising Manager: Paul Belford.\nCopyright FELIX1984.

    "content": "FOOTBALL\nCup run goes on\nafter QMC draw\nf SPORT RUGBY\nFirst round\nsuccess\nIC 1st XV37 Kent XV6 IC finished top of their group in\nthe opening rounds of the U AU with an impressive victory\nagainst Kent.\nKent opened the scoring with\na penalty, soon equalled with a penalty by Seccombe. IC then\npushed forwards and after a deft\nhandling move in the backs,\nThompson timed a beautiful pass\nfor Seccombe to score in the\ncorner. Unfortunately the team\nseemed to lose conviction and\nafter another Kent penalty IC\nwere only winning 7-6 at half-time.\nThe second half was a different\nstory with the wind and sun at\nour backs, Morris, making many\npenetrating runs into Kent's half.\nAfter two more penalties from\nSeccombe, Gilkes scored an\nexcellent try creating space on\nthe wing from nothing, duly\nconverted by Seccombe. All the\ntries after this were converted by\nSeccombe, so he'll not be\nmentioned again! Exley won an\nexcellent ball at the line out\nensuring that IC were nearly\nalways on Kent's line. Parker\nbroke from the base of the scrum\nand towered over to score. After\nanother excellent backs move\nClarke passed inside to Hargave\nto score. Through the whole\ngame Reza won excellent ball\nand always helped the backs\nwhen stranded with the ball. The\nfifth try score by Seccombe\ncame from a delicate pass from\nsecond row Mackay. Hagger had\none of his best days reading the\nfly half accurately and quickly. In\nthe second half the front row was\nsolid. Individually Fyffe's chipping was immaculate, Ferris\nin his best game for us failed to\nscore although he has two tries\nalready this season. Jenkins was\nrobbed on their line after an\namazing sidestep from a short\nline. Phillips' tactical kicking was\naverage.\nTeam Ferris, Jenkins, Fyffe,\nExley, Mackay, Parker, Reza,\nHargrove, Hagger, Phillips,\nClarke, Morris, Gilkes,\nSecoombe, Thompson.\nIC 1st XI 2 QM C1st XI 2\nA hard fought and generally even\ngame gave rise to this rather\nindecisive result in the first round\nof the UL U Challenge Cup on a cold and dreary afternoon at\nHarlington last Saturday.\nAnxiety and desperation ran\nhigh when both captain and kit\nfailed to turn up for the coach,\nbut just as all hope seemed lost,\nthey arrived.\nEarly on both sides struggled\nfor the upper hand and much\nsolid defensive work was\nrequired especially for the agile\nyoung debut ant Jim Brannigan.\nBut midway through the first half\nQM C scored a rather fortunate\ngoal. IC then surged forward into\nattack culminating just before\nthe break when Garry Lawrence, struggling through\nwith a 'head injury', thundered a free kick from the edge of the\nbox past a bewildered QM C keeper.\nAfter another rousing halftime team-talk from captain Neil,\nIC went out re-invigorated for\nthe second half- More fast end-to-end football ensued and Mr Lawrence must claim the\ncreative genius for the third goal\nof the game, when after much\nfancy footwork he split the IC\ndefence with a perfectly timed\nthrough ball to give QM C another slender lead. Frustration\nfollowed for IC as they were\nthwarted time and time again\nuntil Neil slammed home the\nequal lise r from close range.\nA good team performance and\nanother hard game in prospect\nfor the replay on Wednesday.\nTeam P Simpson, J Brannigan,\nB Goldsbrough, R Richards, G Davy, G Lawrence, N Vandeberger, P Bravery, T Dutton, D Lynne, P Dent.\nCareers\nPresentation\n\"Electronic industries are growth industries -growth in size, growth in breadth of\napplication, growth in capital, above all\ngrowth in people of understanding, knowledge\nand skills at all levels of industrial authority.\"\nLeading Industrialist\nSir Monty Finniston\nAs one of the world's leaders in this field,\nTexas Instruments invite you to a CAREERS PRESENTATION, with light refreshments\nand an informal discussion, in the Ante Room\nof the Sherfield Building between 7 p.m. and\n9 p.m. on Thursday, 6th December.\n^ Instruments where people and technology meet\nis now on campus\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nTHE JUNIOR COMMON ROOM\nSHERFIELD BUILDING\nPRINCE CONSORT ROAD /\nSW7 2AZ Tel: 589 8882\nsim12 Friday 23 November 1984 FELIX\n\n"

Despite\ntheir lobby of the Senate\nMeeting, the proposals were\npassed with a large majority. It is\nwidely thought that the\nDepartment of Education and\nScience, who fund the college,\nbecame aware of a drop in the\nposition and status of the RCA since the 1960s. In order to stop\nthe grant being cut, the RCA had\nto establish new objectives and a new policy to meet the challenge\nof the 1980s. The Rector, Jocelyn Stevens,\nwas recently appointed to\nachieve this task. In a statement\nfollowing the announcement of\nthe changes he stressed that the\nrestructuring would take place\nwithin current financial limits.\nHe added that it would renew\ncommitment to research and\nwould open up two new\ndirections in which the college\nintends to proceed.\nI ANNOUNCEMENTS\n\u2022\u2022\u2022Do come to the dear little Guilds\nCarnival tonight.

The speaker\nforecast a prestige race to mars\nbetween the super-powers.\nMr Bond ended his talk with a look at colonisation and\neconomic exploitation, and the\ntypes of vehicles, stations and\nfactories that would be needed.\nOne proposed rocket, propelled\nby nuclear explosions, would\nconvert its launch site, into a desert. A more res list ic idea is a pulse engine relying upon lasers\nconcentrating e nery onto small\npellets of fuel, forming an\nexplosion somewhat similar to a white dwarf, though clearly not\nso large. This is how the\n'Daedalus' unmanned star\nexploration vehicle can travel at\nup to 10% of the speed of light.\n16 Friday 23 November 1984 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "IN THIS\nALIEN ENVIRONMENT,\nSPACE TECHNOLOGY\nIS OUT OF ITS DEPTH\nInspecting underground gas pipelines for faults may not sound like the\nultimate high-tech challenge. But, in\nfact, the task proved to be beyond the\n'state-of-the-art' technologies previously\navailable \u2014 even in military and aerospace applications.\nPROBLEM:\nDesign a vehicle which can travel\ninside the pipe, carrying equipment\ncapable of identifying any significant\ndefect, and pinpointing its position to\nwithin a metre in a run of up to a hundred\nkilometres or more.\nSOLUTION:\nTHE INTELLIGENT PIG\nThe Intelligent Pig, developed by\nthe gas people, is a vehicle carrying highly advanced sensing, data processing and recording equipment. Driven\nthrough the pipe by the gas pressure\nwithin it, the Pig can be used without\ntaking the pipe out of service.\nWhat is more, it can not only pinpoint any defect on the inside or outside\nof a steel pipe, but even describe its nature.\nHOW?\nUsing strong magnetic fields or\nelastic waves propagated at ultrasonic-frequencies, different types of sensors\ncan detect corrosion, cracks, impact\ndamage or distortion of the pipe. But\nthe real challenge lay in processing the\nhundreds of millions of signals produced\nby the sensors in an average run.\nTHERE WASN'TA COMPUTER\nSMALL ENOUGH AND TOUGH\nENOUGH\nMany of the pipes to be inspected\nare less than 305mm in diameter. To fit\nsufficiently powerful data processing\nequipment into the tiny space available,\nhybrid micro circuits incorporating\ncustom-designed silicon chips had to be\ndeveloped. And since the space restrictions also limit battery size and therefore\npower, many of these highly advanced\nelectronic components have to operate\nat the very limits of their specifications.\nWhat's more.the environment inside\nthe pipe isn't exactly friendly. All the\nhighly sophisticated equipment carried\nby the Pig has had to be designed to\ntolerate or be protected from extreme\nvibration, mechanical shock, dirt, and\ngas pressure of up to 70 atmospheres.\nA 'TOMORROW'S WORLD'TAPE\nRECORDER\nThe sheer volume of data to be stored\ninspired the development of what is\nprobably the most advanced ultra-mini at uri sed tape recorder currently in\nexistence. Making extensive use of sub-miniature hybrid microelectronics, new\ntypes of recording heads and ultra-precision mechanical engineering, this\nlittle marvel can store up to 500 million\nreadings on a single reel of standard\none-inch tape,with an accuracy of better\nthan one-thousandth of one percent!\nFROM REEL TO REELS\nOnce the Pig has finished its run, the\nnext job is to prepare the data for analysis by powerful, advanced computers\nsuch as the VAX11/780. There's so much\ninformation in the Pig's tiny recorder\nthat many reels of computer tape are\nneeded to receive it,and many hours of\ncomputer time to analyse it.\nTHE RESULT\nBritain's underground gas transmission network is a multi-billion pound\nasset. And the technical pyrotechnics\nwe've just described have a thoroughly\ndown-to-earth end result\u2014they help the\ngas people to maintain this asset more\nefficiently and cost effectively.\nWHY THE GAS PEOPLE LIVE IN\nTHEFUTURE\nThe fact that gas is Britain's most\npopular domestic.fuel\u2014and a powerful\nand growing force in industry, too-is the\nresult of many years'foresight,planning\nand massive investment by British Gas\nscientists and engineers. And they're still\nworking forthe future-to meet Britain's energy needs in the next century.\nTHE GAS PEOPLEWORKING FOR TOMORROW'S WORLD TODAY\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURED\nIC Symphony Orchestra\nOn Friday 30 November, at 8.00pm in the Great Hall, Imperial College\nSymphony Orchestra will perform what is undoubtedly its most ambitious\nconcert to date. The programme will consist of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring,\nRachmaninov's Piano Concerto No 2 in C minor and Karelia Suite by Sibelius.\nA performance of The Rite of Spring has always\nbeen an ambition of the conductor of the\norchestra, as well as a great number of the players,\nincluding some who have played with the\norchestra for many years.\nIt is very difficult to pinpoint the year when the\norchestra was formed. The person who has played\nwith the orchestra longest, Don Munro, a lecturer\nin the Computing Department, remembers first\nhearing IC Orchestra in 1966 {'Oh it was so bad!').\nIn those days the orchestra was more like a wind\nband and consisted of a few very dedicated\nplayers. ('The soul was there, but the notes just\nweren't in the right place.') There was no Great\nHall to perform and rehearse in, and some\nconcerts were even held in Southside.\nConductors\nOver the years IC Orchestra has had many\nconductors, including two professionals in the\n1970s. The first of these, James Stobart, was an\nexcellent conductor but extremely strict. Under\nhim the orchestra reached a peak. Although it\ndeclined somewhat when he left, it was revived\nwhen the late Gavin Park, a member of the Physics\nDepartment, took over.\nIt was just over five years ago that the orchestra\nreally took off, when the present professional\nconductor Richard Dickins joined. At that time\nRichard was fresh from the Royal College of Music\nand his enthusiasm and ambition (neither of which\nhas ever waned) gave the orchestra a new lease of\nlife. It rapidly expanded to its present size with\nover 80 members, and the standard of players has\nalso vastly improved. There are now so many good\nwoodwind players at IC that auditions are\nnecessary. The brass and horn sections are\nsecond to none and the standard of the string\nplaying is improving steadily.\nThe orchestra performs three major concerts a year and rehearses for three hours every\nWednesday in the Great Hall. It has now become\nan established event to go away to Silwood Park\nfor a weekend in the Autumn term. This is\nintended to help the players to get to know each\nother and the playing is strictly for fun. During the\nday the orchestra sight-read their way through\nvast amounts of repertoire and play chamber\nmusic in small groups. Every other spare moment\nis spent in true IC fashion supporting local pubs\nand the Silwood bar. There are also numerous\ncheese and wine parties throughout the year when\nplayers have the opportunity to perform solo or\nchamber items.\nCommittee\nLike every other society in the College, the\norchestra is run by a committee which is\nresponsible for organising such diverse activities\nsoloist\nWILLIAM HOWARD was born in 1953. At sixteen he gained his ARCO and for some years\nstudied with Joyce Rathbone in London. After four years at New College, Oxford, he\nstudied with Vlado Perlemuter in Paris and with Peter Feuchtwanger in London. He has\ngiven solo recitals and concerto performances throughout Britain and has appeared\nfrequently in the IVigmore Hall and on the South Bank in London. He has performed and\nbroadcast in Italy and Switzerland and has twice visited Hong Kong to broadcast, perform\nand give master classes.\nHe is founder of the Schubert Ensemble of London and has played for many years with\nthe violinist Paul Barritt with whom he won the Greater London Arts Association's Young\nMusicians Award (1980). Together they have toured extensively in England and Northern\nIreland and made several recordings for the BBC.\nconductor\nRICHARD DICKINS started his musical\ntraining as a chorister. He began playing\nthe clarinet at the age of thirteen, making\nhis solo debut eighteen months later. He\nentered the Royal College of Music in 1975\nwhere he studied the clarinet with Colin\nBradbury as well as studying for a London\nUniversity music degree. He was awarded\nan exhibition at the end of his first year at\nthe college and it was at this time that he\nbegan his conducting studies with\nNorman Del Mar. Leaving the college in\n1979 having won a number of prizes for\nboth conducting and clarinet playing he\nmade his Royal Albert hall debut the next\nyear conducting a performance of The\nPirates of Penzance with a chorus of 2000.\nas room bookings for concerts and rehearsals,\nprofessional soloists, publicity for the concert and\nmaking sure that the grand piano is tuned on the\nday. At the end of every year the committee meets\nthe conductor to decide on the works to be played\nin the following year. In the past this has lead to\nperformances of Rimsky Kor sak tv's Sheherazade, the Fifth Symphonies of Beethoven,\nTchaikovsky, Glazunov and Shostakovitch,\nHoist's The Planets and Gershwin's Rhapsody in\nBlue.\nThis year they have finally summoned-up the\ncourage to play The Rite of Spring. This is the\nmusic from Stravinsky's ballet representing a pagan rite when a 'frenzied young virgin' is\nsacrificed to bring about the return of spring. It is a very difficult work to play but it is very exciting to\nlisten to and leaves the audience exhilarated and\nthe orchestra shattered.\nA total contrast to this is Rachmaninov's Piano\nConcerto No 2 in C minor with soloist William\nHoward (see inset). This piece, with its famous\nlyrical and passionate themes is far more romantic,\nand if you think you've never heard it before you'll\nbe amazed at how many of the themes you will\nrecognize.\nThe future\nAs for the future, it can only be expected that the\norchestra will go from strength to strength. The\nstandard of playing continues to improve and\nthere is now a far more ambitious group of\nmusicians than ever before. Come and hear The\nRite of Spring next Friday, and you are promised a concert you won't forget.\nFELIX Friday 23 November 1984 5\n\n"

Due to several\nmiscalculations and a total lack\nof ability IC found themselves\n1\u20140 down at half time. After a rousing team-talk during the\ninterval, however, a restructured side found the going\nmore easy. Superior play from\nthe ladies and inspiring comments from the 'keeper,\nChris Jones, spurned the team\ninto more constructive hockey.\n'You hit it to me, I hit it to him and\nhe put it in' quoth Louise \u2014\nreferring to D Wigney, herself\nand Chris Alcers respectively.\nSgt Pepper's ballet lessons\npaid dividends!

The King's team\ncontained some sharp individual\ntalent but lacked coherence.\nOne defensive error on\nImperial's behalf allowed Kings\nto score their only goal.\nImperial's ten goals come from a number of push shots and put\nCollege in the final. Charing\nCross also reached the final and\nbegan the game with a nil five\nhandicap lead. After a superb\nfirst time shot the score was two\nfive.

    "content": "Founded 1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nNUS slams\nTory cuts\nThe National Union of Students has reacted strongly\nagainst grant cuts announced by the Government last week.\nAction began last Wednesday with a national 24-hour\noccupation of Universities, Polytechnics and Colleges.\nImperial College Union is not affiliated to NUS and did not\ntake part in this protest. An NUS spokeswoman said that\nthis action was well supported with 150 establishments from\nall over the country involved in sit-ins and lecture boycotts.\nA national rally, 'Going for\nBroke', has been organised for\n3.30pm next Wednesday in the\nQueen Elizabeth Hall and\nJubilee Gardens. Speakers will\ninclude NUS President, Phil\nWoolas and a demonstration\nactivity as yet unknown will be\norganised.\nThe NUS believe that the\nGovernment intend to 'privat is e' the higher education system as in\nAmerica, and replace the current\nsystem of grants with students\nloans.\nAccording to a special edition\nof London Student the Under\nSecretary of State for Education,\nMr Peter Brooke, has discussed\nradical proposals put forward by\nthe Adam Smith Institute. This\nbody 'innovates proposals and\ncreative thought into public\npolicy debate 'to promote free\nchoice and a free economy.\nAccording to the document, Mr Brooke said that he would prefer\nto see the banks (rather than\nGovernments) take on the\nadministration of a loans\nscheme. Although the report\nclaims that the document had\ncome from the Department of\nEducation and Science, a departmental spokesman denied\nknowledge of its existence and he\nreiterated the government's view\nthat loans would not be\nintroduced.\nSquatters\nstay\nThe University of London has\nbeen given an possession order\nfor 66-72 Gower Street, the\nbuilding occupied by students\nfrom UCL and LSE. The order\ndoes not become effective until\nNovember 30, providing UL U ensure that surveyors are allowed\nfree access to the building.\nNUS lawyers who acted for the\nstudents opposed the order on\nthe grounds that the University\nhad no immediate use for the\nbuilding and said that an ego cia ted solution should be\nfound. The University said they\nneeded access to the building so\nthat surveyors could start\nplaning its conversion into a teaching area for UCL. Students occupied the\nbuilding, which was formerly a GCE examination office, in\nprotest at the lack of\naccommodation for London\nstudents. The University, UCL and LSE offered a package deal\nto persuade the students to\nleave.This included the offer of\naccommodation in UCL and\nLSE. The squatters saw this as\nqueue-jumping, and decided to\nremain in 66-72 Gower Street.\nChanges\nat RCA\nSweeping changes at the Royal\nCollege of Art were yesterday\npassed by the Senate, the\ncollege's ruling body, to take\neffect from October 1985. The\nrestructuring will affect all but\nthree of the college's schools and\nfaculties. Five schools are to be\nclosed and there will be a reduced\nintake into a further five.\nExisting obligations and teaching\ncommitment to the present\nstudents will be honoured. The\nnormal course length currently\nthree years, will be reduced to\nonly two.\nThe changes are to make way\nfor eighty new places in eight new\ndepartments as well as modest\nincreases in two of the existing\nschools. The number of students\nwill remain at the present level of\nsix hundred before a major\nexpansion over the next few\nyears, say college officials.\nThe RCA students union views\nthe changes as a bombshell. They\nsay that there was no\nconsultation and the first they\nheard of the proposals was in the\nform of a press release.\nAt an extraordinary general\nmeeting last week the union\nnoted that the recommendations\nwill affect all students and\nmembers of the RCA. They\nbelieve that the Academic Policy\nCommittee, where the proposals\nwere decided, is only meant to\nput forward policy options to the\nRCA Senate where they are\ndebated in full.

    "content": "NEWS3\nMooney sausage\ntrumpet shocker\nA new electronic sausage\ntrumpet has been installed in the\nSherfield kitchens after an outbreak of wood wr or m in unfrozen\nsausages earlier this term.\nFor two months vegetarian\nand normal Mooney sausages\nwere mistakenly stored and\nserved in place of each other, and\nwoodworm infested the normal\nsausages which were no longer\nfrozen. Rentokil eradicated the\nimmediate problem but Mr\nMooney has purchased a sausage\ntrumpet to stop such a mix up\nhappening again.\nThe electronic trumpet is the\nlatest type and was bought at a substantial discount as the\nmanufactures wished to use it as\na show piece model.\n'A sausage trumpet has been\nmy aim for ages,' a delighted Mr\nMooney told FELIX. The new model is more\nversatile than previous me chan is ed ones, and will take\nsausages, frankfurters, salami,\nchip ol at as, black pudding and\nliverwurst. Mr Mooney has had it\nprogrammed to confuse pork\nand beef.\nOld trumpets were generally\nvery noisy with, valves, bells and\nlots of tubing, but the new model\nis quite mute.\n'From now on, there is no need\nfor any student to eat an\nun trumpeted sausage. If they\nhave any cause to think their\nsausage has not been properly\ntrump ted, they should bring it\nback at the time,' said Mr\nMooney. He added that if the\nelectronic machine was a success,\nthen a Gabriel silver trumpet\nwould be installed for formal\ndinners and for use in the staff\ndining room where there is\nthought to be a demand for a high-class sausage trumpet.\nYesterday claims by the ALF( Animal Looney Front) to have\ntampered with pastry in the\nCollege Kitchens, were hotly\ndenied by Mr Mooney, 'We've\nbeen using Plaster of Paris for\nyears, so there's nothing new\nabout that. If there are any\ncomplaints about the food,\ncustomers should bring it up to\nthe staff at the counter'.\nNot lost\nThe IC Security Office lias issued\na list of lost-property that it has\nreceived since the start of term.\nThe list, mainly clothing,\nincludes a grey suit, anoraks,\njackets, blazers, rain costs, shorts,\nmackintoshes, rubber gloves,\ngoggles, rugby-boots, jumpers,\ntowels, shawls, scarves and\numbrellas.\n'Property not claimed by the\nend of term, will have to be\ndisposed of', said John Buroughs, Security Officer.\nToy\nstamps\nMost of you will know that the\nCollege has a Day Nursery in\nPrince's Gardens for the care of\nchildren of students, post-grads\nand staff. The main running\ncosts, staff salaries etc are met\nfrom the fees paid by the parents\nbut, as in all ventures of this kind\n, there is a continuing need for\nextra, voluntary funds to buy\ntoys , puzzles, books etc for the\nchildren to use.\nFor the past few years the\nNursery has been able to raise\nsome money for this purpose by\ncollecting and selling Stamps\ngiven by College members from\ntheir im coming mail. Many of us\nget Christmas cards from\noverseas. If you could save the\nstamps from their or from any\nother source and send them to\nSue Thornett (Day Nursery,\nPrinces's Gardens) they would be\nmuch appreciated.\nThe staff and children of the\nDay Nursery would like to thank\nall those who sent them stamps\nduring the last academic year.\nThree return\nfrom Morocco\nlizard study\nThree Life Science students from\nImperial College have recently\nreturned from a two month\nexpedition to the High Atlas\nmountains in Morocco. The\nstudents, Johan Kuylenstierna\n21, expedition leader, Christopher Weedon 21, and Anthony\nHall 21, all took part in the\nscientific work. The project was\nto study the behaviour of a previously unstudied Gecko (a small lizard). The group also\ncompiled a list of all bird life\nobserved in the vac in it y of the\nvillage Imlil. During their four\nweek stay in Imlil the three\nreceived an insight into the life\nstyle of the of the Berber people\nwho live in the mountains. The\nBerbers do not recognise the\ngovernment of Rabat, the capital\nof Morocco, and they do not pay\ntaxes, and as a result of this they\nhave no electricity, no running\nwater and no paved roads. When\ntheir studies were complete the\ngroup was free to travel in the\nmountains and to visit the other\nvillages which scrape a living on\nthe fertile valley floor. Just\nbefore the end of the trip the\nexpedition was able to take time\noff and climb the peak of\nToubkal, which at over four\nthousand and one hundred\nmetres is the highest point in\nNorth Africa.\nThe lizard studies were carried\nout on the behalf of Dr Arnold of\nthe British Museum and the bird\nstudies were compiled for the\nUniversity of Marrakesh, Morocco. The expedition is\nextremely grateful to the\nImperial College Exploration\nBoard for the generous financial\nassistance recieved.\n4\nn FELIX Friday 23 November 1984 3\n\n"

    "content": "SINGLES\nReo Speedwagcrt: Can't Fight\nThis Feeling\nThis lot used to make\nrecords. Now it's Christmas\nhowever, they've obviously\ndecided it's time for a return to a Keep on Loving You style.\nThey do what they do very\nwell. Unfortunately, after a few listening s, this one begins\nto get very boring. A bit 'sweet'\nfor my taste.\nNik Kershaw: The Riddle\nSounds like the Goombay\nDance Band doesn't it? It's almost as awful as well. Nik,\nthe 3ft giant from Birmingham\nmaintains his wimpy, plastic\nimage to keep his teeny fans\nhappy. Grow up Kershaw!\nEven your fans will one day.\nThe Adventures: Send My\nHeart\nAfter talking to a guy from\nChrysalis, at the recent IC gig,\nit would appear that the\nAdventures have a severe lack\nof recorded material to\nchoose a disc from. It is more\nBOOKS\nViolence\nNo poems this week. No\ntravelling and no fashion. We\nare looking at dark, dark\nplaces. News at ten, nine,\neight,...\nTerrorism, Guerrilla war,\nResistance, call it what you\nwill.I counted twelve examples in the news last\nweek without even trying. No\nuse throwing up the hands in\ndisbelief or dismay, because\nlike every other kind of war it\nwill not stop just because you\nknow it should. Understand it.\nThe War of the Flea \u2014\nGuerrilla Warfare Theory and\nPractice' by Robert Taber is a good, concise survey. Mr\nTaber is one of a rare breed \u2014\na Yankee who fought for\nCastro. The book covers\ntheory from Guevara and Mao\nTse Tung and practical examples from Indo-China,\nIreland, Cyprus, Malaya and\nthe Philippines. Disappointfor this reason than any other\nthat they have been forced to\nrelease this as a follow up to\nthe cult-successful Another\nSilent Day. Quite pleasant but\nthat's all.\nFrankie Goes to Hollywood:\nThe Power Of Love\nCredit has to be given to the\nFrankies for such a daring\nchange of direction from the\nphenomenon ally successful\nRelax and Two Tribes. Almost\ncertainly this will be Britiain's Christmas number one. The only question is for how long?\nIt's very clever, but unfortunately I don't really like it.\nSorry.\nBronski Beat: Ain't Necessarily So\nA bit surprising for Bronski\nBeat to release a cover as a single, particularly at this time\nof year. Actually, they are\nsurprisingly good at it.\nExcellent vocal harmonies\nand brilliant keyboards. Listen\nout for the accidental Aint\nnec e celery in the last chorus!\ningly, it misses the present\nTroubles' because of its\npublication date \u2014 last\nrevised 1969. The bias in the\nwriting is clear, but atleast the author is honest about it.\nRemember that reading your\nown opinions will not help you understand someone else's. If you have the time to\nspend, and prefer to use\nprimary sources, there exists\na combined edition of Guerilla\nWar texts by Mao Tse-Tung\nand Guevara in translation.\nPublished by Faber in 1964, I think. Dated, yes, but still in\nactive use. For instance,\nGuevara says that he found\nthe best way to organise his\nfighters was in semi autonomous groups of ten.\nThis provided a useful force,\nwhilst protecting the movement as a whole from\ninfiltration. The IRA didn'tsu s s that one out until the\nmid-seventies. For the other\nside of the story see Frank\nKitson's 'Counter Insurgency\nWarfare'. Frank was an officer\nin the British army and hence\ndraws on colonial experience.\nAgain the damn' thing predates the current punch-up in Northern Ireland. The\nonly book I have found which\ndoes cover this period from\nthe Army's side (not counting\nthose by professional journalists) is'Contact!'by AFN Clarke. This gentlemen was\na Captain in the Paras and\nobviously enjoyed it in a strange bitter sort of way. It is\nnot especially well written\n(none of these books are \u2014\nmust be part of their training),\nbut is useful for two reasons.\nFirstly, it shows clearly and at\nfirst hand the way war\nbrutal is es its practitioners. It\nalso brings home the fact that\nthe Army has to deal with\nattacks from' loyalist' Protestants.\nI have come across several\nreferences to 'A Minimanual\nof Guerilla Warfare' by a blok e called Marighella. Apparently\nit is required reading for\neveryone from the Red Army\nFaction to the Royal Air Force.\nBut no bookshop or library\nseems to stock it. Perhaps it is\nbanned because it is too\ndetailed. Perhaps it is out of\nprint because no-one else\nwants to read it, but I do. If you\ncan point me in the right\ndirection, please drop a note\ninto the FELIX office. Just a note, though. Try out the\n'Good Letter Bomb Guide'\nchapter on someone else.\nRather more quaint, but\nequally vicious, is 'A Book of\nFive Rings' by Miyamoto\nMusashi. Three hundred and\nfifty years old, and still\nchilling. Denis Waterman can\nmuse on The Way of the\nWarrior' but Musashi got there first.\n'...the way of the warrior is\nthe resolute acceptance of\ndeath'.\nWell, I can't fault that. Does\nhe drink Carling Black Label?\nYOU ask him. 'A Book of Five\nRings' is a text on strategy by a master swordsman, who by all\naccounts would have made\nErrol Flynn swat profusely.\nEven older \u2014first published\n500 BC \u2014 is Su n Tzu's The Art\nof War'. Not a lot of fun to read\nall at one go, but an insight\ninto a totally different way of\nlife. There is a rather nice\nstory about Sun Tzu which\ngoes like this:\nThe Emperor of China was\ntalking to SZ about war, and\nasked for a demonstration of\nsome of its principles. SZ ordered the harem to stand to\nattention . Nothing happened,\nexcept that the women giggled.\n'If the orders are not clear,\nthe General is at fault', said\nSun Tzu inscrutably. The\ndrummer stopped, and SZ repeated his order \u2014 audibly\nthis time. Still, he only got\nZREVIEWS I giggles from the harem.\n'If the orders are clear, but\nare still not obeyed, then the\nofficers are at fault', he\ngrowled. Then he had the\nhead of the harem executed.\nThe women screamed, and\nthe Emperor was said something to the effect of\n'Look here, old chap, that IS\nmy wife'. But after that, Sun\nTzu got instant obedience,\nand the Emperor so impress ed that he made him\ncommander-in-chief. Lovely\npeople, are't they?\nOf course, not all soldiers\nwrite books. Some of them\nhave problems with writing\nstraightforward instructions.\nIt is of these heroes that\nNorman F Dixon writes in 'On\nthe Psychology of Military\nIncompetence', \"\"\"his is not\nquite the dry tone that you\nmight expect. The first part\ncovers several examples of\nmilitary disaster, and the\nsecond sets out to relate the\nfailings of the officers concerned to problems of\npersonality. The conclusions\nand the suggestions offered\nabout causes and symptoms\nof incompetence apply to\nanyone who manages or\ncommands; not just soldiers.\nMiss this one at your own risk.\nCINEMA\nGhostbusters\nAnother typical, American,\n'slapstick' comedy, with over\nthree heroes saving the whole\nworld, let alone New York,\nfrom the psychic evils of the\nunderworld. A new Idea?\nThe action is well interspersed with that popular\n'clap-along' song f om Street\nCred Ray Parker Junior to\nwhich those zany American\naudiences actually clap. Not\nagain! From behind this\nbizzar e and captivating fag a cde, however, the same\nold jokes are offered; but who\ncares?\nThe special effect are good\nproducing incredibly cute\nlooking ghosts with great\ntaste in wine and European\ncheeses. I would say,that the\nscary monster scenes are\nperhaps the funniest from a good beginning, though, the\nfinale is just a little too...'mega'...super...over-done. The evil goddess having\nan incredible likeness to\nSheena Easton from head to\ntoe in sparkling leotard. I expected her to burst into\nsong at any instant.\n'I ain't afraid of no ghost' but\nso long as the sky does not fall\non our heads tomorrow life\ngoes on. Not a painful two\nhours.\nFELIX Friday 23 November 1984 7\n\n"
