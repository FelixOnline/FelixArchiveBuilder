ISSN 10140-0711.\nSTOIC: The Sequel\nDear Hugh,\nIn reply to your Editorial\ncomment about the STOIC\n'All Nighter', I would like to\nmake clear one or two\npoints.\n1) Electrical Engineering do\nnot control the TV Studio.\n2) I made it very clear to\nthe current STOIC\nchairman that over-all\napproval would have to be\nobtained before such an\nevent could take place. It is\nnot my fault that they\npublished details before\ndoing so!\n3) STOIC do not own the\nTV Studio.\n4) The studio is here to\nprovide a production\nservice to all departments\nin Imperial College (and\nhas done so since 1976).\nSTOIC is lucky to have\nsuch facilities available to\nthem and at times does not\nappreciate the very low\nstudio charge being made\nto them and the time which\nI put in on Tuesday and\nThursday evenings and\nduring Wednesday\nevenings (sometimes up to\n9pm) for the making of\nNewsbreak\u2014all this is\nunpaid time on my behalf\n(you don't hear me\ncomplaining about that!).\nI feel that STOIC is\nbecoming like a spoiled\nchild and that efforts; and\ntime making 'All Nighters'\ncould be better spent on\nimproving what purports to\nbe a News-magazine\nprogramme.\nRegards,\nColin Grimshaw,\nProduction Manager,\nTV Studio.\nPS Why don't you do a Feature on the College TV\nStudio, and show what it\ndoes do!!\nDear Hugh,\nAfter last week's decision it\nhas never been so obvious\nhow much college hostility\nthere is towards STOIC.\nNot only that but the\nminimal Studio time that\nthe union can afford has\nreduced programme output\nby 25%, causing complaints\nfrom the viewers.\nIf the Union think\nCollege will subsidize\nSTOIC like it did that\nfamous row-boat it is\nmistaken. Yet again the\nUFC has postponed the five\nyear planned Studio\nupgrade\u2014probably until\nSTOIC is actually kicked\nout of the College Studio,\nwhich after years of\ninactivity has found more\nprofitable pursuits than\nproducing student\nactivities.\nCome on folks lets have\na few quid to produce\nthings you want to watch\nie films, vi dios, time\nswitched programmes and\nof course the type of union\nreports you saw on Guilds\nother video.\nYours tired of taking this shit\nRichard Copnall.\nFELIX: The Boredom\nDear FELIX Editor,\nBLOODY BORING\u2014this is\nhow we feel about recent\neditions of our wonderful\npaper FELIX!\nIts OK to have the\noccasional article of\npolitical/serious discussion\nhowever this needs to be\nspiced up with an equal\namount of:-SCANDAL, ADVENTURE,\nNAUGHTINESS ETC.\nGo read The Sun I hear\nyou cry\u2014well we do! But it\nwould be nice to think we\ncould also enjoy reading\nthe College paper each\nFriday after all it is\nsupposed to be written for\nus.\nPeople at IC aren't all\npolitically active, socially\naware, or even remotely\ninterested in anything of\nthe sort. Lets face it some\nof the people at IC are\nfairly unhinged but this\ndoes not mean that they\nshouldn't be catered for:-What's wrong with\narticles about err... Rhino's willies (have you seen the\nsize of them?), Lesbian\ncows (they really do go far!\nyou know) and the sex\nappeal of bald headed\neconomics lecturers\n(woo ooo!) So it might provoke cries\nof rudeness, irrelevance etc\netc.. So What!\nIt might be that people\nhave been too apathetic to\nconti ri bute any articles to\nFELIX. However I think this\nreflects on the editor\u2014if\nyou included interesting\nexciting articles, you might\nget interesting exciting\narticles written for you. If\nyou continue to publish the\npolitical ramblings of one\nor two people we might\nthink that's all you wanted.\nIt is not only the subjects\nof the articles but also the\nboring nature of the\n2 Friday 22 November FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Flagship\nFor Sale\nResearch at IC featured in\na misleading article\npublished in 'Computing'\nlast week, suggesting that\nthe Alvey Flagship\nsupercomputer research\nwas about to be sold to\nmajor US defence\ncontractors. This research\nincludes work on new\narchitectures for intelligent\nknowledge-based systems.\nThe article stated that a delegation from US military\nsuppliers, United\nTechnologies, had had at\nleast two meetings with IC\nstaff involved in Alvey\nprojects, and had asked\nthem about government\npolicy as well as about\nareas of research in which\nIC is a recognised leader. A further meeting was\nreported to have been\ncancelled at short notice\nafter an open letter to Mrs\nThatcher, signed by several\nIC researchers, rejecting\nUK involvement in Star\nWars. 'Sources at Imperial'\nwere quoted as saying that\nthere is strong resistance\nat IC to taking part in a Star Wars project. Closing\nthe article was a complaint\nfrom Labour MP Chris\nSmith that the government\nshould make sure research\nresults were made good\nuse of rather than being\nsold abroad.\nProf Sayers, Head of the\nDepartment of Computing\nat IC, described the article\nas 'inaccurate and\nsomewhat speculative'. He\nconfirmed that the\nAmerican delegation had\nvisited IC and had spoken\nto Dr Phelps, the ProRector for External\nDevelopments. Members of\nthe Computing department\nhad met the delegation, but\nProf Sayers had not been\npresent. He was also\nunaware of any staff having\nspoken to the Press on the\nsubject.\nProf Sayers expressed\nthe opinion that the\nconnection with the US\nMilitary was\nover emphasised in the\narticle, as they were still\nnegotiating with potential\nindustrial partners. He also\nfelt that selling the Alvey\nresearch abroad would be\nunwise, considering that\nthis research had originally\nbeen intended to put\nBritain back 'on the\ndefence scene'.\nChannel Crossing\nThe 149th annual CCU cox less threes raft race was won\nby RCS last Sunday. Guilds were a close second and\nMines, whose raft only just managed to cross the\nSerpentine, a distant third. Earlier, RCS were also\nvictorious in the three-way tug-of-war. RCS first combined\nforces with Mines to dispose of the Guilds team, and then\nbeat Mines in the final.\nStar Wars II\n'There is no scientist who\nbelieves President Reagan's SDI project can ever work',\nor at least no one who Prof\nRalston, Professor of\nComputer Science and\nMathematics at the State\nUniversity of New York,\nknows of. Prof Ralston,\nwho is curently visiting the\nDepartment of Computing,\nspoke to 60 staff and\nstudents at Tuesday's 'Star\nWars' CND meeting, where\nhe addressed the political,\nfinancial and social aspects\nof the SDI program.\nHe went to add that, in\nhis opinion, the project is\n'intellectually dishonest'\nand almost everyone in\nfavour of it (President\nReagan excepted) believes\nthat it cannot work.\nHe blames this\nintellectual dishonesty on\nthe large financial rewards,\nwhich, in his words, 'warp\nthe judgement of\nprofessionals'.\nHe finished by discussing\nStar Wars research in\nuniversities, and he\nexpressed the opinion that\nuniversities should not be\ninvolved in 'mission\norientated' research,\nparticularly Star Wars.\nProf Lehman did not\nattend the meeting.\nHockey\nSuccess\nIC Hockey 1st XI won the\nsouth-eastern division of\nthe UAU championship by\nbeating City University 4-1\non penalty flicks.

Opening times\nare the same as those of\nthe Southside Bar.\nFalkland's Factor\nMr Tarn Dalyell MP spoke\nfor 40 minutes yesterday on\nthe subject for which he is\nbest known, the sinking of\nthe General Belgrano. In\nhis talk which was\ndelivered without notes, he\nreiterated all of the\narguments for which he has\nalready been given a great\ndeal of publicity. He again\naccused the Prime Minister,\nMrs Thatcher of 'gross\ndeception, lying and\ncalculated murder', and\njustified this because, he\nasserted, he was duty\nbound to show up the\npolitical mis be ha v our of the\ngovernment in the name of\ndemocracy.\nThe rest of his talk was\nmainly taken up with the\ncrisis in education in this\ncountry at present, and\nhow a future Labour\ngovernment would seek to\nrebuild and reinforce that\nwhich the Tory government\nhad undermined and\ndestroyed.

All you girls out there\nremember, fast cars, wild\nthings and faraway places\nawait you).\nSuddenly they were\nplaying. Polyester and\nrubber clashed with wood.\nPins flew. Tasos's arms\nwaved. The A team (So\ncalled because of an\nunfortunate superficial\nresemblance between BA\nBaracus and Eric) swept to\nvictory, cruising the craven\nBrunei spawn beneath their\ndesigner shoes.\nThe unopposed Brunei\nladies actually turned in the\noppositions best\nperformance of the day\ngiving them an automatic\ntwo points, but to no avail.\nSuddenly they were\ngone, on a rusty wing and\na prayer leaving an\nemotional vacuum in\npassing, the voices of those\nwho had witnessed their\nfirst victory in living\nmemory hushed with awe,\na single phrase on their\nlips, 'Who were those\nmasked men?'\nRugby\nWednesday\nUAU\nMens\nSurrey 1sts0 IC 1sts13 Surrey 2nds23 IC 2nds9 Friendly\nMens\nC&G1s ts6 Kings 2nds15 Saturday\nLadies\nIC 0 Charing Cross 0\nBadminton\nCharing Cross\nWednesday\nUAU\nMens\nSurrey 1sts6 IC Ists 3\nSurrey 2nds2 IC 2nds7 Ladies\nSurrey 1sts2 IC 1sts7 Saturday\nULU League\nMens\nUCL1 sts2 IC 1sts7 Ladies\nIC 1sts9 St Barts 1sts0 Golf\nWednesday\nUAU\nSurrey 1sts3 IC 1sts3 Fencing\nWednesday\nUAU\n1st Round\nIC 14 UE A42nd Round\nIC 14 UCL0 Netball\nWednesday\nUAU\nSurrey 36 Surrey 25\nSaturday\nULU League\nL SP41 IC 31\nTable Tennis\nIC 1sts7 UL 2nds2 IC 1sts2 Lyndhurst 1sts7 IC 4th s4 Betnal Green 5\nSailing\nFencing\nOn Saturday the Imperial\nCollege Fencing team took\npart in the UAU South\nEastern region mens team\nevents, and won.

As a result they\nqualified for the last sixteen of the UAU national rounds\nAnd so it came to pass that\nthe almighty Captain Tony\nspoke unto his people of\nthe challenge from Exeter,\nand so the sailors did go to\nExeter, where they did unto\nus what we did unto\nCambridge last week.\nAnd on the first day\nCommodore Phil said 'let\nthere be wind', and there\nwas wind..eventually,\nfollowing the efforts of Mai,\nDaniel and Ape, After the\ndelayed start, 2 of our\nboats ably manned (and\nwoman ed) by Tony and\nMaurice, Pete and Karen,\nshot at lightning speed to\nthe front of the fleet.\nDespite a fierce struggle,\nthey maintained this\nposition, confident in the\nknowledge that there was\nun faltering back-up from\nthe rear, by Helen and\nSam.

Last Wednesday though,\nthe rot set in Mike Never\nAgain on a Wednesday'\nBall lived up to his name,\nand in spite of the efforts of\nthe aforementioned\nillustrious committee boys,\nslumped to fifth in the\nLondon Colleges League\n2nd race at Trent Park,\nalthough we still head the\nleague overall.\nNot forgetting our\nsolitary lady, Sue Waters\nfor her staunch support so\nfar, but she needs some\ncompany (in the ladies\nrace, that is!)\u2014come on\ngirls, give it a try! 1\nFELIX Friday 22 November 13\n\n"

The oar itself\ncame off second best,\nhowever, and had a blade\nbroken in the struggle.\nGuilds later gained revenge\nby winning the C CU boat\nrace.\nThe Morphy Day\nreconciliation bar night was\ndisappointing. During the\nevening Union President\nCarl Burgess disappeared,\ntaking with him the keys to\nthe Upper Lounge, where\ntwo barrels of beer were\nstored ready for when the\nbar closed. Mr Burgess also\nhad the clues to the\n'Idiosyncratic Event', which\nwas to take the form of a treasure hunt. As a result,\nwhen the Upper Lounge\nwas finally opened, the\nbeer had to be given away\nfree.\nSCAB Sings\nThe Blues\nSCAB Nite was a major\nsuccess, even though it\nwas closed down early.\nPictured above are one of\nthe bands who appeared at\nthe event\nCarl In\nThe Drink\nICU President, Carl\nBurgess, was soaked on\nTuesday evening while\nusing the Sherfield toilets\naccording close aides of\nhis.

    "content": "Biology Want More\nOf Union Building\nUp to half the Union Building\nwill be converted to academic\nuse if the Biology Department's plans go ahead. In addition to\nthe Bot/Zoo Common Room\nand the Lounge, the department\nhas plans to convert other\nrooms on the ground and first\nfloors of the Union into labs\nand lecture theatres.\nThe need for extra space for\nBiology has arisen from the\ndecision to sell the Ashurst\nLodge buildings at Silwood\nPark. Silwood is the College's field station near Ascot, where a large part of the Biology\ndepartment is based. At present\nresearch is carried out there on\ntwo main sites, Silwood Main\nHouse and Ashurst Lodge,\nwhich are nearly half a mile\napart. The sale of Ashurst\nwould necessitate the re-housing of research groups\nbased there either in South\nKensington or in new buildings\nnear Silwood Main House. It is\nto house those to be moved to\nSouth Kensington that the\ndepartment wants to take over\nparts of the Union Building.\nProfessor Anderson, Head of\nthe Biology Department, is\nbelieved to want the sale to go\nahead so that as large a part as\npossible of the department can\nbe moved to South Kensington.\nOnly research which needs the\nspecial facilities of Silwood\nwould then remain at the field\nstation. Staff based at Ashurst\nLodge have been asked to\nconsider whether they need to\nremain at Silwood or can be\nmoved into London.\nThe move from Silwood to\nSouth Kensington would not\ntake place quickly. After being\nsold, most, of Ashurst Lodge\nwould be leased back from the\nnew owners to accommodate\nCollege staff until new labs\nwere found for them. Thus the\ntake-over of the Union Building\nmight not be presented as a single package, but could be\nachieved piecemeal over several\nyears as a phased with drawl from Ashurst Lodge takes place.\nIf the Lounge and Bot/Zoo are\nat ken next year, they could be\nfollowed by the UDH and SCR\nin subsequent years.\nThe plans are of course\ndependant on finding a buyer\nfor Ashurst Lodge. There is only\none potential buyer at present,\nbelieved to be the\nCommonwealth Institute for\nBiological Control (CIBC), a commercial research institute\nwho already have some staff\nbased at Silwood in the Main\nHouse. They are interested in\nacquiring more space for future\nexpansion and are considering\nAshurst Lodge as well as\npossibilities on other sites. A decision is expected from the\nCIBC next month. However,\nplanning permission has already\nbeen obtained for new buildings\nnear Silwood Main House, some\nof which will form the\nTechnology Transfer Centre\n(based on the 'Science Park'\nidea) but some of which are\ndesigned to re-house research\nat present carried out in Ashurst\nLodge. Building is expected to\ncommence in March or April\nnext year.\nThe Guilds hit squad gave Stirling Moss an unexpected drive\naround South Kensington on Tuesday. In a daring raid\nmasterminded by Field Marshall Roger Preece, the motor ace of\nthe early 60's was bundled into Bo by two heavies, one brandishing\na pop gun, and whisked away at a daring speed. Guilds henchmen\nwere then despatched to the lecture theatre where Mr Moss was\ndue to give a talk and demanded vast amounts of money for his\nprompt return. The victim eventually arrived ten minutes later and\nwas said to be cold but none the worse for his ordeal.\nNUS\nKop It\nLiverpool University Guild\nCouncil have decided by 38\nvotes to 34 to withhold half their\nNUS affiliation fee, a sum of\n\u00a315,000. At an earlier Union\nGeneral Meeting a motion to\nd is affiliate from NUS had been\ndefeated. The motion passed at\nthe Guilds Council meeting\nclaimed that NUS was 'an agent\nof the Labour party' and\nexpressed dissatisfaction with\n'extra v agent' spending, a profit\nof \u00a31/4 million and reserves of\n\u00a31 million.\nDeputy President Andy\nWilkinson said they had\nsubmitted a motion on reform\nfor the NUS Conference, which\nNUS first claimed not to have\nreceived. Later NUS said they\nhad received the motion, but\nthat it had not been accepted.\nHe went on to say that\nLiverpool University Students'\nUnion pays four times the\nnational average in affiliation\nfees. The Union is awaiting a reply from NUS which may have\nbeen delayed as there is a postal strike on at the moment.\nThe NUS Press Officer\ncommented that it was up to\nLiverpool Students Union 'to\nsort themselves out' and that\nthere had been a political\nfaction within the Guilds\nCouncil who were effectively\noverruling the decision made at\nthe UGM not to d is affiliate. So\nfar no decision has been taken\nregarding the non-payment of\nhalf the affiliation fees, or\nwhether the matter will be\ndiscussed at next month's NUS\nConference.\nICU President Carl Burgess\nclaimed that it is being\nspeculated that Liverpool\nStudents Union are trying to get\nthemselves expelled from NUS\ndespite the U GM vote to remain\naffiliated.\nSweeney\nStrikes\nScab Nite and the Lounge\nBeach Party were closed down\nby security at midnight on\nSaturday. This occured after the\nUnion Bar gents lavatories had\nbeen vandalised by a Cardiff\nMiners sports team, who had\nbeen playing RSMU. Security\nguard, Terry Sweeney, said he\nthought there was something\nodd going on, when he saw\nloads of people walking past his\noffice with pieces of copper\npiping.\nFree Friday 22 November No 722\n\n"

This is in fact\nan incredibly fast time, so\nfast in-fact that we lost half\nan hour at one point\nwaiting for the tender car\nto catch up.\nAll of the above could\nhave been easily confirmed\nby any Guilds hack, so you\nreally have no excuse for\ngetting it wrong.\nPedantically yours,\nEd Ashford, Bo Driver.\nPS Get it wrong again and\nwe'll send the boys round.\nBookshop Reply\nDear Editor,\nRegarding the councils\nworries about the\nBookshop. We do not have\nan overdraft. We have an\noverdraft facility if it is\nneeded. Any union official\nor student can come to see\nme at anytime to discuss\nany problem regarding the\nBookshop, after all it is\nyour Bookshop. If they did\nthey would have up to date\ninformation.\nWith regard to our stock\nlevels, lecturers are asked\nto let me have their\nrecommendations in June\nfor the coming Academic\nyear. From the information\nreceived I order a percentage of books\naccording to the number of\nstudents taking into\naccount previous sales\npatterns. They should also\nlet me know when the\nbooks will be required.\nUnfortunately some put\nOctober when they may not\nbe needed until January as\nhappened last year, thereby\nseriously affecting our our\ncash flow. If we do not\nstock all recommended\nbooks people complain, if\nwe do and they haven't sold in the first month of\nterm it still worries people\nincluding me.\nSince I have been here I have insisted that the\nBookshop committee meets\nmonthly so I can keep the\nstudents representatives of\neach of the unions up to\ndate with the latest\ndevelopments.\nYours Faithfully\nRoy Hicks\nManager\nIC Defectors\nDear FELIX,\nFollowing our recent visits\nto ULU it has been\ndemonstrated to us how\nbad life at IC really is. Why\nis it that the only thing IC\nis famous for its\nDRUNKEN, BORING MALE\nSCIENTISTS, who only lift\ntheir head out of a text\nbook to attend union bar\nnights. FELIX, as the main\n(only?) source of\ninformation to IC students\nmust be to blame for\nportraying this image of\nour College, with four front\npage 'LEADERS' out of six\nabout bar problems. Do\nyou honestly believe this is\nthe most important thing in\nstudents minds? Or is it\nsimply a fact that nothing\nof greater interest happens\nat our College.\nThis image of IC has\nbeen typified in last weeks\nLONDON STUDENT where\nit comments about the\nrecent Charity Rag Beer\nfestival at IC on Wednesday\n13 November;\n'The thought of all those\nPhysicists staggering\naround drunk is enough to\nmake me sick before they\nare. This is one for laying\ndown and avoiding'.\nAlthough we are one of\nthe largest colleges in\nLondon University, and one\nof the most respected by\nindustry, we seem to\ncommand a very low\nrespect from ULU receiving\nlittle attention in their\nstudent magazine. Is this\nthe fault of ULU\ndeliberately in goring IC?\nOr is it the fault of IC\nisolating itself from the rest\nof the university? We think\nit is the latter. We do feel\nisolated because we are not\naffiliated to the NUS and\nwhen was the last time we\nhad an opportunity to vote\non this position? Certainly\nnot since we have been at\nCollege.\nWe realise that our\nsituation in South\nKensington doesn't help,\nbut many other College\nnot in close proximity to\nULU manage to be more\ninvolved in the Union. How\nmany IC students have ever\nbeen to ULU, or even\nknown where it is\u2014we\nthink not many.\nVery rarely, maybe for\nthe mentioned reasons, do\nstudents come to IC,\nwhereas our students must\ngo elsewhere for our\nenjoyment. The amount of\nIC students, at QE C( KQC)\non Friday night illustrates\nthis. We think IC, despite\nits disadvantage has\nsomething to offer London\nstudents. People who have\nbeen elected to responsible\npositions should be trying\nharder to encourage\nintegration between\nLondon students rather\nthan the integration of IC\nmales in the union bar.

    "content": "SBANDSBANDSBANDSBANDS\nNorman and the\nNutburgers\nThe Smoking Concert\nThe curtain rises. The\naudience squeals in\nanticipation. Then the\naudience stops squealing.\nYou see, this isn't just any\nordinary band playing any\nordinary gig\u2014this is Norman\nand the Nutburgers, and so\nonstage there is some\nconfusion. Quite a lot of\nconfusion, in fact.\n'Are they ready?' asks the\ni gh ting man. Nobody seems\nto know, least of all the band,\nwho are stumbling about on\nstage trying to work out\nwhich instrument they're\nsupposed to be playing.\nFinally some sort of order\nemerges: Norman's bass is\nhanging just above his knees,\nDuncan, resplendent in\nunderpants,\nplastic apron\nand chef's hat, sits behind his\ndrum kit, Andy sways slightly,\nclutching at his guitar, Roo\nand Karin look extremely\nembarrassed, and Charlie\nstands centre stage, a solitary, heroic figure, a faraway look in his eyes. He\nis trying to remember the\nwords. Suddenly he snatches\nat his microphone, shouts\n'One! Two! Three! Four!'..and\nthey're off!\nThere is a certain aura\nabout Norman and the\nNutburgers, an un explain able air of mystery that somehow\ndigs to the very fibre of their\nbeings. Perhaps it's the\nsunglasses. Perhaps it's because they can barely\nstand, let alone play. Perhaps\nit's because Charlie can't sing to save himself.\nWhatever it is, the audience\nlove it\u2014feet a tapping\neverywhere, they're dancing\nin the aisles, on the window\nledges, in the chairs. 'The\nfirst person to come down to\nthe front chews a mike stand,'\ngrowls Charlie, and sure\nenough, a whole crowd of\npeople rush forward...\nFrankly I can't understand\nwhy anyone likes this band.\nBut they do. Even I like them,\ndespite everything my mother\ntold me. Amazing, yes, but\ntrue!\nNorman and the\nNutburgers play absolutely\ntheir last gig ever in\nSouthside Bar, next Thursday\nnight. Don't miss it!\nI'm sure it is possible to learn\na great deal about a society\nfrom the films it produces.\nThe output from America is\noften fast, exciting and just as\nfrequently trivial and\nsuperficial, and as talented as\nAmerican are at quickening\nthe pulse, they, largely, seem\nto have left the remaining\nwide spectrum of human\nemotions to be covered by\nthe rest of the world. The\nEastern Europeans seem\nespecially adept at producing\nsome very human stories, a particularly fine example of\nthis is the Yugoslavian 'When\nFather Was Away on\nBusiness'.\nThe title refers to a eup hems m used to describe\nthose who have been sent\naway for having criticised the\nregime in some way. The\nvictim in this case is the\nfather of Malik, a six year old\nthrough whose eyes the story\nis related. The father has\nmade some in discrete comments about the\npropaganda having gone to\nfar to a mistress who casually\nrelates them to a party\nofficial, resulting in a period\nof forced labour. The lot, as\nsuch, is simply about the\ntrials and tri bu at ions of Malik\nand his family, the mother,\nthe father and his inventive\nbrother and it covers the\nperiod from Malik's circumcision in 1950 to his\nforced labour\nbeing chosen, for reasons of\nacademic success, to present\na baton to the Major two\nyears later, this being the\nlength of his father's sentence.\nThe real delight of this film\nis that everyone, right down\nto the guard with two lines\nand ten seconds of screen\ntime, is a natural actor with\nan innate sense of timing and\ndelivery. But ex pec i ally worthy is the young Malik\nwhose wonderful\nperformance instils emotions\nthat far more experienced\nactors would have trouble,\nand may never su cee d, in\ndoing. It is quite simply a lovely film and I urge you to\nrush along to it's opening\ntonight at Cannon's new\nPremiere cinema at what\nused to be Scene Swiss\nCentre.\nConveniently, to illustrate\nthe point about national\ncharacteristics further,\nanother of Cannon's releases\nthis week is 'The Boys Next\nDoor', an account of how a couple of 'regular guys' can\ngo spare and reek havok. In\norder to lend credibility to the\nstory the film opens with\nsome stills of mass murders\nand some of the things that\nthese apparently normal\npeople had said, and it ends\nwith a newspaper-like\nphotograph of the survivor of\nthe two kids that the story\ncentres on.\nBo and Roy, just graduated,\nhave one weekend before\nthey spend the rest of there\nlives in a dead-end job in a factory, so they decide to\ndrive to LA for a holiday.\nThey are misfits who\nmass murderers\napparently have no emotional\nen vol ve ment with school,\nfamily or peers and whilst\ndriving to L.A. Roy, Maxwell\nCaulfied, also reveals that\n'angry stuff that he has inside\nhimself. Inspite of moments\nof conscience Bo, Charlie\nSheen (another talented son\nof Martin Sheen), goes along\nwith Roy as their pranks\nbecome more serious finaly\nleading to several murders.\nTo emphasise the normality\nf of these two kids they are\ncontrasted against some of\nthe more colourful\ninhabitants of the L.A. nightlife but I couldn't help\nfeeling that if these two\nsexist, racist bigots were\nconsidered normal then\nAmerica has some real\nproblems. As one reaction aly cop says 'everyone's got gins\nthee days, they're more\npopular then sex'. But as a comment on the need to\nspend more time preparing\nthe young for life and on how\nthe strong willed can\ninfluence the weak, the film\nmay have some value, but as\nentertainment I'm afraid I'm not so sure.\non Swan's way by a escaped\nswan, the brothers' grief is\nprofound and obsessive and\nit causes them to become\ninvolved with the driver of the\ncar, Alba Van Meegeren, the\nsurgeon who am putted Alba's leg after the accident, then\nconspires to remove her\nremaining one, and\nconspiracies at the zoo\ndeepen into an exotic game\nof barter and blackmail as\nIn complete contrast 'A Zed\nand Two Noughts', like Peter\nGreenaway's last major film\n'The Draughtsman's Contract', is an intricate and\ncomplex film with allusions\nto just about everything.\nTo convey his ideas on\nchance, symmetry and\nevolution, Greenaway centres\nhis story on two brothers\nworking in a zoo.

Among\nthem is Vida, a woman who\nhates her beautiful body, and\n(of course) has written a book about it. She and the\nlibrarian, a really off-beat\ncharacter, have sex because\nthere doesn't seem to be\nanything else to do.

The prose style\ntakes a bit of getting used to,\nnot being the typical Great\nEnglish Novel genre, and the\nauthor, Richard Brautigan, is\nobviously a very lazy writer\nsince most of the book is\nblank pages. The aim of a large part of the book is\nsupposed to be character\nsketching; the only problem\nbeing that they aren't sketched. If you can put up\nwith these shortcomings and\ntolerate the odd ball\ninhabitants then you'll find\nyourself at the anticlimax of\nan ending before you've\nrealised that the story has\nbegun.

    "content": "Comets\nRecent exploration of the\nsolar wind and the earth's magnetosphere by Debbie\nWilkes\nOn September 11 1985 the\nInternational Cometary\nExplorer passed through\nthe tail of the GiacobiniZinner comet, and so\nbecame the first spacecraft\nto be involved in a direct\nencounter with a comet.\nImperial Cbllege Space\nPhysics group, headed by\nDr David Southwood, were\ndeeply involved with this\nproject, having provided\nthe energetic ion detector\ncarried by this spacecraft.\nRemarkably, one year to\nthe day earlier, the Active\nMagnetospheric particle\nTracer Explorers\nprogramme created the first\nman-made comet. Once\nagain, the Space Physics\ngroup were involved,\nhaving developed the\nmagneto meter carried by\nthe UK spacecraft.\nThe three satellites in the\nlatter mission, collectively\nknown as the Active\nMagnetospheric Particle\nTracer Explorers (AMTE),\nwere launched from the\nKennedy Space Centre at\nCape Canavaral, on the\n16th August 1984. AMPTE\nwas a joint mission of the\nUnited States, West\nGermany and the United\nKingdon; with each of\nthese national teams\nproviding a spacecraft. The\nmission carried out a series\nof experiments designed to\ninvestigate the interaction\nof the solar wind with the\nEarth's magnetosphere,\nwhich is the most distant\npart of the earth's at mos here. In this region,\nthe Earth's magnetic field\ngreatly influences\nbehaviour, and so a magneto meter to measure\nthe field is a key instrument\non a mission of this type.\nThe space Physics group,\nin collaboration with the\nUniversity of California Los\nAngeles provided the\nmagneto meter carried by\nthe British spacecraft, An\nartist's impression of the\nUK Craft, showing the\nmagneto meter, can be seen\nin Fig 1.\nThis instrument, which is\ncapable of measuring\nmagnetic fields as small as\n1/50,000th of the field at\nthe Earth's surface, is set\non a boom one metre from\nthe body of the craft to\nminimise the effect of stray\nfields from the spacecraft\nmaterial and operating\nelectrical equipment. At all\nstages in the mission\nmagnetic field\nmeasurements played a central role in the\ninvestigations.\nMagnetometer\nSun and earth\nSensors\nparticles in the\nmagnetosphere, much of\nthe fundamental physics\nremains to be understood.\nTwo of the most intriguing\nproblems are centred on\nhow some solar wind ions\ncan penetrate the barrier\nformed by the Earth's magnetic field, and how\nthese particles can become\naccelerated, in some cases\nresulting in the spectacular\nAururae Borealis and\nAustralis.\nThe unique feature of the\nAMPTE Mission was to\nrelease tracer ions, namely\nlithium and barium, in an\nattempt to investigate the\nentry of solar wind particles\ninto the magnetosphere,\nS band vhf\nAntenna\nThe continuous flow of\nparticles from the sun into\ninterplanetary space is\ntermed the solar wind; it\nconsists of electrons,\nprotons, helium nuclei and\nother ionised material\nwhich pass from the Sun\nthrough the Solar System\nand eventually merge into\nthe general inter steller medium. The\nmagnetosphere forms a tear shaped cavity in the\nsolar wind, where the\nmatter is fully ionised ie in\nthe plasma state. While a great deal is known about\nthe structure and dynamics\nof this gas of charged\nand their subsequent\ntransport. All previous\nmissions had only carried\nout passive measurements.\nIn between the active ion\nrelease phases of the\nmission, the three\nspacecraft made passive\nmeasurements on the\nEarth's ionised outer\nat mop here. Although a great deal of data still\nremains to be analysed,\nthere has already been a major breakthrough in our\nunderstanding of how the\nsolar wind interacts with\nthe Earth's magnetosphere.\nThe American spacecraft\nwas equipped with a comprehensive set of\ninstrumentation to detect\nthe mass and charge\ncom posit on of the\nmagneto ps here. Its task\nduring the ion release\nexperiments was to monitor\nwhether test ions released\nby the German craft, into\nthe solar wind upstream of\nthe Earth's magnetosphere,\npenetrated to its orbit deep\nin the magnetosphere.\nDuring these experiments\nthe British spacecraft was\nsitu tate d close to the\nGerman craft to monitor\nthe local effects of ion\nrelease. On the 11th and\n20th of September 1984 the\nfirst minute quantities of\nlithium were released,\ninitially producing some\nartificial cometary effects.\nBut, it was on 27 December\n1984 that a barium release\nled to the German craft\nbeing enveloped in what\nwas heralded as the first\n'artificial comet'; a cloud of\nionised barium 5,000km long, which was actually\nobservable from the\nground, see fig 2. This use\nof the solar wind to mimic\nsome aspects of cometary\nbehaviour, such as solar\nwind deflection and tail\nformation, is very\ninteresting as the existence\nof the solar wind was first\npredicted to explain\ncometary tail formation.\nHowever a more complete\nunderstanding of comets\ncould only come about by\nactual spacecraft\nencounters with real\ncomets.\nIn September of this year\nthe International Cometary\nExplorer (ICE) became the\nfirst spacecraft involved in\na direct encounter with a comet, when it passed\nwithin 8,000km of the\nnucleus of GiacobiniZinner. ICE was originally\nlaunched by NASA in 1978\nas the International SunEarth Explorer 3 (ISEE 3)\nand was designed to\ninvestigate the solar wind\nand particles. By\nredirecting a spaceship that\nhad already completed its\noriginal mission, NASA was\nable to keep the cost of the\nproject down to 3 million\ndollars; as compared to 500\nmillion dollars if a purpose\nbuilt craft had been used\nThe Imperial College\nSpace Physics group\nprovided the energetic ion\ninstrument which was used\nto measure the ions created\nby the comet, these\nobservations provided the\nfirst evi dien ce of the\napproach of GiacobineZinner in the ICE date.\nResults from the mission\nhave shown the Comet's atmosphere results from\nsublimation of the icy\nsurface material of the\nnucleus. This then\nundergoes complex\nphotochemical reactions\nwith sunlight, which leads\nto break up and ionisation\nof the in it al molecules. The\nresult have already ended\n30 years of speculation on\nthe nature of solar wind-comet interactions but it\nwill be many more months\nbefore all the data can be\nanalysed, and the full\nimplications realised.\nHaving survived this\nencounter the International\ncometary Explorer is now\nmoving on to the\nren de vous with Halley's comet in March 1986.\nWhere, it will carry out\ninvestigations upstream of\nthe comet at the same time\nas Giotto (the European\ncraft) and Vega (The\nRussian mission) encounter\nthe nucleus.\nnS Friday 22 November FELIX 7\n\n"
