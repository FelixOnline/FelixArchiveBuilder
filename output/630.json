Any other business.\nPresidents Report To ICU Gravel at H arlington College has been aware for several years that there have been significant\ndeposits of gravel at H arlington. In fact gravel is being extracted from a site\nadjacent to the College sports field by Streeters. The estimated royalty that\nIC could expect to earn is estimated at \u00a31.1 m. However, we have been unable\nto confirm this figure because we could not place the more detailed facts\nbefore our professional adviser. We have attempted to establish certain\nprecedents concerning the purchase of H arlington that mean that any monies\nraised should be put towards student athletic facilities.\nIt is important that the Union monitors this because extraction would \u2022 seriously affect the space available for sports at H arlington. I therefore ask this meeting to approve my proposal that our support for\nthis scheme will be conditioned on the provision of at least thirty acres of H arlington being playable at any one time. In addition we should be fully\ninvolved in the decision making process and supplied with all the necessary\ninformation. Bars\nFollowing the motion which was passed at the last UG MI informed Bob Schroter of my mandate and my intention to jolly it up. He then spoke to\nJohn Smith and Brian Lloyd Davies, and wrote back with a set of proposals\nthat Council overwhelmingly accepted and that Council recommends to the\nU GM. The proposals are as follows:\n1. That Bars Subcommittee has access to the individual trading accounts\ngiven that these are treated in confidence and are not publicised outside the\ncommittee. Any breach in confidence will result in these figures being\nwithdrawn.2. Bob Schroter confirmed that the Bar Subcommittee Chairman will\ncontinue to normally be an ICU nomination appointed by the Refectory\nCommittee Chairman.3. With reference to the Terms of Reference, Bob Schroter stands by the\nRefectory Committee terms of reference and states that they have been known to all preceding Bar Subcomittee chairmen.\nOn behalf of Council I recommend acceptance.\nResidence\nStudent Services have proposed a scheme that will assure all first years of a place in Hall and will prior at ize postgraduates in the following way:1. high fee paying overseas students\n2. other overseas students\n3. departmental recommendations\n4. women on MSc courses\n5. men on MSc courses\n6. women in research courses\n7. men in research courses\nthis depends on the full usage of Intercollegiate Halls and the maintenance of our Head Tenancy agreements.\nIam in the process of selecting applicants for interview concerning the post\nof Welfare Assistant at Student Services.\nSouthside\nThe Southside Working Party met Mr DW Clark, the Estates Secretary, on November25 and discussed the revised plan for extensive use of Southside as\na Union facility. This matter is to be discussed with J H Smith, the College\nSecretary ( Head of College Admin) and then SWP will formulate a set of recommendations to be taken to aUG M UGM TUE 7th GREAT HALL\n1:00pm DP1. Following a spate of thefts from the Union Gym and changing rooms\nthe door at the back of the mens changing rooms has been locked; unfortunately it has not been possible to do this in the ladies as it is a fire exit.\nSince the small lockers for valuables have not been sufficient the large coin return lockers are now being restored\u201420 are now operational and the other\n28 will be completed before the end of term. Iam looking into installing\nlockers in the ladies changing rooms as well.\n2. The Union Building is to be extensively redecorated this year with the\ncentral staircase being totally repainted and the Senior Common Room being\nredecorated and totally refurnished. The Upper Lounge should also be\nincorporated in this scheme.\nThis is part of a new policy to redecorate the whole Union Building over\nthis and next year which I hope to see carried on, working up from the ground\nfloor.\nEstimates have been obtained and I envisage work to start immediately\nafter Christmas and the whole of this years part of the project to be finished\nby the second week in February.3. I have tidied up the West Staircase as much as is possible and would appreciate it if all those clubs who sweep all their rubbish out of the Gym on to the West Staircase stopped. In future I will have rubbish bags there, so\nplease use them.\n4. The results of the House Committee questionnaires which requested\ninformation from all clubs and societies as to what facilities they needed in\naddition to those already provided have been collated and four new\ncupboards have been ordered to help cope with the large demand for\ncupboard storage space. I have also asked about the possibility of putting\nthree additional noticeboards in the J CR and hope for a positive response\nfrom College in the near future, as demand for noticeboards in this area is\nheavy.\n5. For those who are not aware, the kitchen area behind the old refectory is\nbeing converted into storage facilities for Ents who will be based there. The refectory will then be used for various discos, etc. This work is almost\ncomplete and this area should be fully operational by the beginning of next\nterm.\n6. The lock on the cleaning cupboard has been changed and a new stock of\nmops, buckets and brooms obtained to enable us to provide adequate\nfacilities to clean up after large functions without a shortfall in equipment. In\nfuture it will be necessary to obtain a key in advance from me for a deposit if\ncleaning materials are required after any event.\nHon See's Report\nYou will probably have noticed that Exec News is now in the same typeface as\nthe rest of FELIX. This should make reading it much easier in future. My thanks go to MartinS Taylor and Maz, only their cooperation has made this\nchange possible. However as a result of this new system if you want to submit\na motion, as anyone can, to be printed in Exec News, then I must receive it at\nleast two Fridays before the next U GM. Motions will still be accepted up to a week before the U GM and will be printed separately.\nThe next U GM is on Tuesday December7 with what looks like a very\ninteresting motion on toilet paper and the latest in the NUS debate.

    "content": "IREVIEWSI\nLittle Cretin\nSchweyk in the Second World War by\nBertolt Brecht, music by Hanns Eisler,\ndirected by Richard Eyre, The Olivier,\nNational Theatre.\nSchweyk, the archetypal 'little man' and\nimbecile and moron extra ordinaire, was born\nof the pen of Jaroslav Hasek in the early years\nof this century. In The Good Soldier Schweyk,\nthe hero achieves the rare distinction of being\ntaken prisoner by his own side. He is a disgrace to his uniform (an ill-fitting one).\nJaroslav Hasek, a Bohemian, seems to bear\nan uncanny resemblance to the hero in his\nnovel. Hasek scribbled stories in the intervals\nof wandering off and getting into drunken\nbrawls. His sole biographer, Sir Cecil Parrott,\nrelates of his frequent entry into police\nrecords, one of which was to the effect that\n\"while in an intoxicated state, the above-named performed his lesser bodily needs in\nfront of the main police station.\" A one-time\nsoldier and a one-time anarchist, he achieved a modicum of respectability when he edited a journal called 'Animal World', but spoiled it by\ninventing new animals and embellishing it with\nhitherto unknown facts such as that elephants\nenjoy gramophone records.\nBrecht considerably reworked the novel into\nthe musical play we have today. The Brechtian\nSchweyk is once again an accomplished cretin\nwho tells jokes and ludicrous anecdotes with\nan incessant zeal. Bill Paterson takes on the\n(demanding) title role in the production at the\nNational Theatre, and what a hilarious evening\nit turns out to be!\nSchweyk's cretin is m is gloriously demonstrated right from the start of the play. A Gestapo agent brings in news of attempt on\nAdolf' s life in Munich. Sch wey k wonders\nwhether this is the Adolf who worked for the\nchemists and is now in the concentration\ncamp, or the Adolf who collected dog manure\nand is now in the concentration camp.\nBut there is more to Schweyk than his\nimbecility. Schweyk does not resist. He does\nnot rebel. He does not argue. He does not\nquestion. He does not demand. He does not\ndefy. In short, Schweyk possesses all those\nsplendidly negative attributes that authority\nlooks for in the perfect, passive citizen. Authority can always depend on Schweyk. But\ndon't think Schweyk and his story is a period\npiece. Oh no, Schweykism lives and there are\nSch wey ks everywhere, yes even in this College. Even the person sitting next to you as\nyou read this may be a Sch wey k.( Your reviewer knows of at least two Schweyks in\nthe College.) Most importantly for the play, a Schweyk knows the secret of immortality\nitself: yield. The first rule of Schweykism is\nconquer by yielding. Shall not the meek inherit\nthe earth?\nIn Schweyk in the Second World War we\nare seeing how the world's Sch wey ks contributed to Hitler's global campaigns, albeit\nin a hilarious manner. The play is interluded\nwith views of the 'higher regions' where Hitler\nand his accomplices look down on the world\nand demand reassurance that they may\ndepend on 'the little man', and it is here that we\nwitness a stroke of genius by the designer of\nthis production, William Dudley. Hitler and his\ngrim gang (Himmler, Goering, Goebbels and\nVan Bock) are presented as enormous figures\nwith strikingly large masks. These appear right\nat the beginning of the play in a halo of dry ice\nand coloured lights among clouds drawn in the\nmanner of caricatures of these characters.\nHissing electronic sounds complement their\nmetallic echoing voices, and one is reminded of\nsome episode of Dr Who involving the master\nof the universe or some such. The production\nis full of such bedazzling theatrical effects. On returning to the auditorium after the interval\none is confronted with an enormous box over\nwhich is draped a black cloth. At the start of\nthe second part a huge hand descends upon\nthis box and lifts off the drapery with forefinger\nand thumb in a Python esque fashion. A Hogarthian corner of Bedlam is revealed,\nreplete with cripples, and of course Schweyk.\nBesides the settings and the effects, the\ncharacters and the plot are no less amusing.\nBrettschneider. Gestapo agent provo cat eur, is\nplayed by William Armstrong. With a small\nmoustache, well worn raincoat and grubby\nbriefcase he looks the picture of a provincial\nnewspaper journalist seeking some sordid\npiece of scandal, Mr Armstrong can assume\nthe most ludicrous and comic facial expr es ses. Brian Glover plays Baloun, a rotund\ngentleman rather partial to dumplings, and\nHarry Towb plays the part of SS Lieutenant\nBullinger. A large part of the plot comes\naround the trouble Schweyk finds himself\nlanded in when he is ordered by SS Bullinger\nto wrest out of the clutches of its owner a little\ndog he (Bullinger) has taken a fancy to in the\npark. Bullinger wants to give it to his wife, and\nSch wey k has to get the dog or face the\nconsequences.\nThe production comes a little bit loose at the\nseams in the second part when there is much\nwandering about the stage and little dialogue\nbut this doesn't blot the production in a significant way. The play remains very funny,\ntotally zany and totally unmissable.\nNick Bedding\nLyrical Epic\nThe Night of San Lorenzo, Cert A, written\nand directed by Paolo and Vittorio\nTaviani, Curzon Cinema, Cur on St.\nSubtitled.\nIt is the night of San Lorenzo, the night of\nthe falling stars when wishes come true, that a young woman chooses to recall her loved\none, her baby son, one such night long ago in\n1944 when she and a group of peasants ie fi behind their small Tuscan village to escape the\nNazis and seek the protection of their allies,\nthe Americans. But the child is asleep and the\nyoung woman therefore talks to herself and\nthe audience.\nThe peasants wander across their ancestral\nlandscape managing to avoid the Germans but\nfailing to avoid the fascists, the blackshirts.\nThese encounters are brief and bloody, but\nthroughout the film the peasants' struggle with\nthe landscape and with the marauding gangs of\nfascists is blown up to epic proportions in the\nminds of the survivors. The events are as seen\nthrough the eyes of a six-year-old girl, but the\nTaviani brothers are clearly seeking to chart\nhow a human ordeal changes with time in the\nminds of individuals, and how it is embellished\nand handed down through the ensuing decades. In short the brothers are seeking the\norigins of a legend. The peasants' arduous trek\nthrough the countryside becomes a kind of\nIliad and when, through hunger and tiredness,\nthey begin to hallucinate, they see Homeric\nfigures complete with shield, helmet and lance\nmaterialise by their side.\nThe film paints some shocking contrasts\nNot all the villagers left their homes, about half\nsought refuge in the church: the church, and\nthe people inside, are blown up by the\nGermans. The sight of the priest, dejected and\nsurrounded by corpses, and suddenly lonely\nas his remaining flock escape the scene of\ncarnage carrying with them their mutilations\nwas indeed a pitiful sight. (The Tavi an brothers claim the events as fact; the film is\nbased on their childhood experiences Another shocking contrast was a fierce battle\nbetween the wandering peasants and the\nblackshirts in a ripe corn field. However, this\nscene somewhat failed to convey the drama\nintend1. Many died in this confrontation but\nbecause the film never built up on character\nis ation to any significant extent, this episode\nwas somewhat distant and un moving. Even the\nsuperb Omero Antonutti, who played a harsh\nand almost eccentric father in the brothers'\nacclaimed Padre Padrone, fails to com through as a distinct character.\nThe film ends where it started with a romantic view of a starlit sky above a quiet\ncity, seen through the opened windows of a room. The woman's voice softly concludes the\ntale; the legend has now become a romance.\nWinner of the Special Jury Prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival The Night of San\nLorenzo is lyrical, visionary and epic, and\ndespite its limitations it remains a very good\nfilm.\nNick Bedding\nFELIX II December 3, 19821 I Page9\n\n"

Firstly, D rCT Onions' book ' An Etymology\nof the English Language' gives\nthe word 'betray' as deriving\nfrom the Latin' Trade oe re', from which we also have such\nwords as 'Trader'\u2014surely an\nhonest occupation.\nSecondly. I fail to see how Mr Garside can refer to Webster's 'Usage and Abusage' without\nmentioning Heinrich Splitter's authoritative work' The Etymological Derivations of English from German Words'. While admittedly Herr Splitter\ndoes not actually mention the\nword in question, such an omission on Mr Garside's part is\ntotally unforgivable.\nFinally, Mr Garside cannot be\nunaware of my American colleague Professor J Crumbling Sweatshirt's book' Really amazingly obscure, ludicrous or\njust plain silly meanings of everyday words', which attaches\nto the word 'betray' a symbolic\nmeaning that (while I shall not\nmention it in the columns of this\nworthy journal) Mr Gar side might do well to research.\nIam.

    "content": "EDITORIAL\n( \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 ED Southside Move\nOnce again College Secretary\nJohn Smith and the Estates\nDepartment are trying to get the\nUnion moved to Southside. The\nplan, if it goes through, will\ninvolve moving most of the\nUnion facilities to the lower floors of the Southside Building\n(below the Halls of Residence)\nwhile allowing College to take\nover the present building in Beit\nfor their own purposes. College\nare prepared to pay for the\nmove. Why are they being so\ngenerous? More importantly, why are they trying to rush it\nthrough so quickly? In my Editorial in one of the post grad FELICE SI made some observations as follows:\n\" When the idea of moving the\nUnion to Southside was first\nmooted, cautious optimism seemed to be in order. Premises\nin Southside are underused, and\nit is in everyone's advantage to\nhave the Union situated as near\nto the main Halls of Residence\nas possible. Plans had been drawn up after long consultations with a responsible Union President, and despite protests\nfrom certain factions who hold a strong sense of tradition (notably\nmy two predecessors) it seemed\nthat the Union could well benefit\nfrom such a scheme.\nBut College's attitude is\nchanging. Right from the start\nJohn Smith has been holding his\ncards close to his chest. The\nmove was proposed last March, but the plans were not revealed\nto the student body until the\nvery end of May, shortly before\nthe end of term and certainly not\nallowing enough time for sufficient debate on the matter before\nundergraduates went home for\nthe long vac. It was then revealed that for the move to\ntake place in September 1983,\nthe Union would have had to\napprove the plans by the end of\nOctober 1982, only a few weeks\nafter undergraduates had re-assembled. Caution began to\nharden into suspicion.\nNow the suspicion is turning\nto distrust. College is trying a different tack. Plans for the\nmove have been shelved for the\ntime being while College offers\nmore facilities in Southside; very\ngenerous, but we should still be\nwary of their motives. In a year\nor so, if Mr Smith points out to a different Exec that since we have\nso many Union activities based\nin Southside it might benefit us\nto move the whole Union there,\nit will be as well to remember the\nmethods that were tried the first\ntime, and to examine the options\nvery carefully.\"\nThe hard sell didn't work, so\nCollege switched to a less heavy- !\nhanded approach. Now, with a new Exec mostly inexperienced\nin dealing with College, John Smith has switched back to\ntrying to push the deal through\nas quickly as possible\u2014just as\nMark Smith warned that he would\nin his Editorial last May. The\ncorrect attitude now, as in August, as last May is to be very,\nvery, careful before we commit\nourselves, and then to get the\ndetails of' any deal well publicised and in writing.\nChristmas FELICE SI warned you last week that\nthere will be no FELIX next\nFriday December 10; instead\nFELIX has got together with the\nCareers Service to produce a careers brochure containing lots\nof articles for those of you who\nare thinking about what you're\ngoing to be doing for eight hours\na day for the rest of your life. It\nwill be printed with the old red\nFELIX design (like last year's FELICE S) and there won't be\nenough for everyone to have\none, so please don't take one if\nyou're a first year or a second\nyear who is less than keen on\nmaking a decision about a career. It's essential reading for\nthird years, of course.\nThe following Tuesday is the\nbumper Christmas FELIX, the\nlike of which has never been seen\nbefore. This issue coincides with\nthe retirement of Captain Lindley, the salty old sea-dog\nturned College Administrator\nwho was so viciously pilloried by\nmy predecessors.\nHe rose to fame two years ago\nwith his repeated in sistance that\nCollege is being run at the zenith\nof efficiency, and this somewhat\nexaggerated view together with\nhis catchphrase T don't stand\nand count 'em' made him almost\ntoo vulnerable to a student rag\nFELIX BH H HM HH Hi such as this. I 've let him off\nlightly this term, but next week\nthe Christmas FELIX will be a special Captain Lindley retirement issue, with much naval and\nex-naval humour.\nIn addition, Pinocchio is\npreparing a double spread of\npuzzles, Victor Mooney (no\nkidding) is writing on the lighter\nside of Christmas cooking, Scaramouche (remember him?)\nis offering silly ideas for Xmas games, Walkabout-Looksee will\nbe explaining the best way to\nmake mince pies light\nAnd finally, we shall reintroduce the Christmas free\ngift, a regular tradition until two\nyears ago. Yes, the team who\nbrought you the cut-out model\nof the Albert Memorial, the\ncontraceptive s martie( hold it\nbetween your knees) and your\nvery own FELIX hack (a cough\nsweet in every issue) have done it\nagain. Wait till next week and\nsee the biggest and best free gift\never. All this and more in your\nChristmas FELIX, published Tuesday week.\nClubs and Societies\nA letter from Chess Club in\nrather injured tone complains\nthat I refused to print a boring\narticle they submitted two weeks\nago; may I offer my own defence, rather than use the\npitiful excuses they put into my\nmouth in their letter ( before demolishing them, of course).\nYou were warned at the end of\nlast term (in my statement of\nintent) and in the Freshers' issue\nthat this year's policy would be\nto cut right back on clubs and\nsocieties articles. I asked if anyone objected to this, and\nreceived no complaints.\nWe do print some RC C and\nS CC articles, and I'm sorry if the\nChess Club consider them' meaningless drivel': nevertheless it's not their job to decide\nwhat is drivel and what isn't: it's mine. And I base my decision,\nnot only on my own opinion, but\non feedback from other students.\nLast year the consensus was that\nmost clubs and societies articles\n(with few exceptions, notably Sci\nFi) were boring; this year, then,\nthey get axed.\nBut there is another, yet more\nimportant reason, and this is\nwhy ACC get three pages and\nRC C,SC C, the Bookshop and\nthe CC Us share one page: space\nis FELIX is only limited by the\nmanpower available, and it is\npart.of the ACC Vice Chairman' s job to act as FELIX Sports Editor.

I mean this quite\nseriously: any takers?\nOther Inclusions\nNo society, religious or otherwise,\nhas a God-given right to articles\nin FELIX. All letters, small ads,\nfeatures and opinions are included at my discretion, and It end to be less discreet with anything anonymous or pseudonym o us. When it comes to Opinion policy is to allow anyone the\nright to one article, and then any\nopposing faction the right of\nreply. I cannot then allow the\nfirst writer to reply to the reply\nor proliferation and boredom\nbecome the order of the day. If\nyou write an opinion, I'm afraid\nyou'll have to accept that your\nopponents will have the last\nword. I won't let the opinion\ncolumns become a literary tablet ennis match; if you' re not happy with the state of affairs\nafter two articles, write to the\nletters page.\nChristmas FELIX Copy Deadline\nis 1730h on Monday6 th.I Page5\n\n"

Their goal keeper was so intent on avoiding\nkicking the ball anywhere near\nMcG uck in, he kicked it straight\nto Rick ard. who scored.\nA final goal, resulting from\nMcG uck in drawing no fewer\nthan six Kings defenders out of\nthe box, was a mere formality, so\nde moral is ed were Kings by this\nfine citizen.\nThirds\nIC vs QE C122 Having trekked the wild outback\non foot from Richmond tube, I CIll' s miraculously arrived complete with eleven men at the\nremote Petersham sports ground\nto take on the might of a Queen's first eleven who had\ndemolished a depleted IC IV's61 only ten days previously.\nFollowing a hesitant start on a rain-soaked pitch which didn't allow either side to dominate, IC allowed Queens the luxury of an\nunmarked header from a flicked-on corner and paid the inevitable\nprice.\nAn enthusiastic fight back ensued with centre forward Anton Milner battling gamely\nagainst a tight central defence.\nThe breakthrough finally came\nthrough a powerful drive from\nnew signing Bill McG inn which\nleft the keeper grasping for thin\nair. Happiness was short-lived\nhowever as a simple defensive\nerror was punished in clinical\nfashion, and QE C went into the interval leading by the odd\ngoal in three.\nAn exciting if slightly scrappy\nsecond half saw several chances\ngo begging at either end.

Ray's sieve1 ike memory managed lo somehow\nguide us to the required bus stop\nand we arrived with plenty of\ntime to spare so the local c hippy was invaded and Jeff and Mark proceeded to show these B rum mies how to play video games,\nbefore returning to the bowl to\nregister.\nAt midnight precisely the bowling began.\nFor the first few hours the\nteam bowled well, staying as\nhigh as fifth place for some time\nbut at around 7:00pm we started\nto tire. Ray, who had previously\nproved himself extremely adept\nat skimming the ball under the\ngate with just a few inches to\nspare, actually started to wait\nuntil the pins had put in an\nappearance before starting his\nrun up, and as the teams scores\nfell away the dreaded sub hundred looked increasingly likely. After a number of close\nshaves it finally happened at\nabout 10:30, and the whole team\nwas smothered in sympathy for\nhis embarrassment.\nBy this time, Andy was storming up the individual positions and by the end of the\ncompetition at mid-day he had\nreached third place overall, out\nof 120 entrants. Paul excelled\nhimself bowling well above average to finish approximately\n25th, and Kevin, Jeff (who also\nbowled above average), Ray and Mark finished in a clump between 40th and 60th, the team\noverall finishing 8th out of 20th. Team: Ray Cook, Jeff Quinn,\nMark Stanley, Kevin Short, Andy\nMcMullan, Paul Schofield.\nRifle & Pistol\nIt's been a bad week for IC's top marks person T Huggs who flopped to a miserable 89 in the\nLS BRA league, thus wrecking\ntotally the chances of ICA team,\nunless Gary and Gordon,( Pro-fess or) Bowser can produce the\nsort of form that has pulled us\nfrom the jaws of ignominy on\nmany occasions before.\nThe well known medical vagary' Bisley Twitch' has played havoc with the technique\nol several members, notably Julia Avery, who narrowly beat\nJohn Warton in reaching the\nweek's lowest score of 77(!).\nTonight( Friday) members have a golden opportunity to\nexperience at first hand the\nastute wit of Steve Harrison( Club Captain, contact via Elec\nLng letter-racks) as he delivers\nthe ritual devastating homily to\nthe nation from the top table at\nthe club dinner. All meet in Stans at 7:15pm. A warning to\nany female marks persons pre-sent, watch out for Noel Lind say, especially if he is carrying a sleeping bag.\nSquash\nl st s3Q MCl s ts22n ds2V2 Lon H2 nds2723 rd s2R FH2 nds34 th s1Q MC'2 nds45 th s1 Barts l sts45 th s5Q MC4 th s05 th s5BS O2n ds0 Ladies 5 Barts 0\nLadies 5 QE C4 The First s, Seconds and Thirds and Ladies continue to\nhold their own in their respective\ndivisions. Especially pleasing are\nthe Fifths team's performance to\ndate, bearing, in mind that we're\nthe only club in the league to run\nthis many mens sides. Following yet another disappointing and inexplicable Fourth team result\nthere has been some reshuffling\nof the selection order in a desperate attempt to avoid relegation to the depths of Division5. This is one reason\nwhy a number of players have\nbeen receiving late night, last\nminute Sunday evening calls.\nOther team member sIring deliberately at unearthly hours\nas retribution for not having\nticked off.\nA sample V necked, acrylic IC Squash Club jersey, price \u00a38.00\nhas at last arrived from Kimberley Promotions.

    "content": "Queensgate?\nDear Sir\nI have read with interest the\nrecent articles in FELIX concerning the College bar accounts.\nAfter 'ast week's development\n( \" Bar Accounts Open\") , Iam moved to put pen to paper.\nPerhaps Iam now getting rather long in the tooth and my\nmemory is failing me, but at the\nback of my mind I recall once\nbeing able to read in FELIX that\nthe profit and loss figures for the\nrefectories and the bars. Now it\nseems we're to be given less than\nthat.\nFrom all the discussion the\nlegal position of the bars seems\nto have been omitted. The bars\nin College operate under a' Club certificate', whereby the sale of\nalcoholic beverages is permitted\nto members of the club. This\nclub is the IC Refectory Club, which every student and member\nof staff of the College is a member of. No rules or constitution, perhaps conveniently, appear to exist for this club.\nIs it not a strange state of\naffairs that the members of a club can not and may not see the\naccounts for their own club. I hardly think that the members of\nICU would tolerate a similar\nsituation if this was the case with\nthe Union. We hear a great deal these\ndays about the accountability of\nbusinesses to their workforce. At Imperial College, seemingly, we\nare producing a generation of\nfuture managers who are taught\nthat not only is accountability\nunnecessary but it is also undesirable. It would seem\ninstead that secrecy in financial\nmatters is the lesson of the day.\nBy now Richard Nixon no\ndoubt greatly regrets ever making the statement \" There will be no cover-up at the White\nHouse\". Will this then be IC's 'Watergate'. If there is nothing\nto hide, why hide it? Such needless secrecy is the very feedstock of malicious and unfounded rumour. In the words\nof the greatest' fan' in the\nbusiness, \" Should we be told?\"\nYours faithfully\nIan N Lacey\nM REP GI told\nyou so?\nGuildshit... again\nDear Martin\nI am writing to you because I feel that your article \" Guilds hit Hits the Fan\" suggests that\nGuildsheet is carrying out a campaign against Nick Pyne,\nthis is just not the case.\nFive issues of Guildsheet have\nbeen produced this term, only\ntwo small articles on Nick Pyne\nhave been published (issues 2,4).\nThis does not seem to me to be\nthe \"series of attacks on himself\nin several issues\" that you mention on your front page,\nparticularly as in the same period we have criticised Mike Bartlett three times, Gordon Bowser three times, Engineering\nBoard, Bar Committee, and Stephen Gould er all twice as\nwell as Steve Bishop, Jo Claydon and Brian Shindler once each.\nIam quite content to stand by\nthe contents of Guildsheet,to the\nextent of vigorously defending\nany action Mr Pyne may take\nagainst us in the courts!!!\nYours bemused ly Frank Rowsell\nGuildsheet Editor Dear Martin\nTwo weeks ago, I entered\nthe FELIX Office to ask you\nabout the copy deadline, since I had been asked to write an\narticle for your paper by Chess\nClub. You asked what it was\nabout, and when I told you, you\nrecommended that I should not\nbother as you probably would\nnot publish it because no one\nwould be interested. Anyway I wrote it and submitted it, and, of\ncourse, you did not publish it. I do not know, or particularly\ncare, why it was not published\n( badly written, or noone interested), but what does worry\nme is that when a society such as\nChess Club does submit an article, its first of the year no\nless, that it is ignored. We do not\ndemand, ask for, or expect massive coverage, but it would\nbe nice to be acknowledged when we do contribute to what is\nas much our newspaper as\nanyone else's. Other societies, eg\nSciFi, contribute boring, meaningless and usually uninformative drivel every week and\nhave it published.\nOne of the reasons you gave\nme for probably not publishing\nwas lack of space. This, one can\nclearly see, is your policy so as to\nstop societies contributing. It\nseems ridiculous to me that\nsocieties in ACC receive two\npages (three this week) in which\nthey wrote reports which are\nonly relevant to their own members, a point on which you\ncriticised me (indeed, they even\nput in team lists which very few\nof us could give a damn about),\nyet R CC,S CC,CC Us and the\nBookshop all have to share one\npage. You might claim that\nsports teams represent the College, but this falls down, because so do Chess Club( my\narticle concerned one such event,\nif you read it). IC Chess Club is\nthe strongest collegiate chess\nclub in London, entering two\nteams for the UL U league and\nfour for the UL U knock-out, as\nwell as being the only College to\nenter a team (two, in fact) in a league outside of the University.\nThe conclusion of this letter is,\nplease if, or when, we submit\nanother article, do not dismiss it\nbecause you regard us as insignificant (a lot of people at IC are\ninterested in chess, even if they\ndo not belong to Chess Club), and, more generally, no society\nshould be regarded too insignificant for a mention in the\nnewspaper of Imperial College\nUnion, if they ask for such a mention, or a small amount of\nspace, because people are interested in societies to which\nthey do not belong.\nYours sincerely\nDP Kingston\nIC Chess Club Commit te,4 th member\nDear Sir\nThe accusation made in last\nweek's FELIX that I have carried out character assassinations of Nick Pyne in Guildsheet\nis totally false.\nGuildsheet has not published\n\" a series of attacks\" on Nick Pyne, nor is the 'Hissing Sid' column written solely by myself\nas was stated in FELIX. Furthermore I was not the author of the\npiece in the previous issue of\nGuildsheet that Nick Pyne took\nexception to.\nAll that I have written for\nGuildsheet has been, I believe,\nfair comment on matters of\npublic interest.\nI am sure it is not in the\ninterests of either Guilds or Nick Pyne to become involved in a long and acrimonious dispute.\nWhy can't the Editor of Guildsheet and Nick Pyne discuss their\ndifferences in an adult and amicable way and let the matter\nend there? Yours faithfully\nJP Stanley\nPS: I thought Guildshit was\nhilarious too.\nDear Martin\nI realise that the subject of\n' Guilds hit' may be old and perhaps weary, but I would like\nto clarify the situation and correct certain comments in your editorial.\nI personally, along with CB and Frank, took no exception to\nthe publication, content or distribution of 'Guildshit'; along\nwith Steve Gould er and yourself\nI found it highly amusing. It was\npurely the removal of Guildsheet\nwhich was annoying as people\nhad been working all night to\nenable us to distribute it on Wednesday morning, and the\nfact it contained material specifically related to Morphy Day. As yourself know Messers\nPyne and Barnett have apologised and agreed that the removal of Guildsheet was wrong; I thank them for their\napologies.\nYour editorial referred to\nheavies and suggests physical\nintimidation; when I went to\nfind Mr Barnett there were indeed six people with me; most\nof whom would not be described\nas 'heavies'. The purpose of this\nwas to enable rapid redistribution of Guildsheet and obtaining\nthe missing copies. I personally\nasked Mr Barnett for the copies,\nexplaining reasons why this was\nnecessary. These he accepted and returned the copies in approximately fifteen minutes.\nYou mention official channels; it\nwas felt that speed in obtaining\nthe missing copies was of prime\nimportance, and this speedy\nreturn was the only major requirement; thus rendering official channels as a secondary\nconsideration. As you know Steve was informed, so as to\nkeep him in the picture.\nWith reference to the copies of\n' Guilds hit' in our possession these were those from Elec Eng, these have now been distributed\nfrom the Guilds Office to people\nwho came in asking for them.\nYours sincerely\nSteve Bishop\nCity& Guilds President 1982/3\nPage4l\nI December 3,19821 I FELIX\n\n"

Rumours that the performance was inspired by the wearing of wet,\nsmelly RCS shirts were vigorously denied, though many players\non the Goldsmiths side reckoned\nit was due to the mysterious\n'sixteenth player' wearing a red\nshirt. This apparition, they claim, was seen to be tackling\nplayers round the neck, joining\nruc ks on the wrong side, spoiling\npossession and, worst of all, blowing his whistle stopping play at vital moments. Totally\ndemolished by this, they concentrated on verbal assaults on the\naforementioned player, while the\nIC team got on with and winning\nthe game. Tries from Noddy, Mickey, Howard and AN Other\n(whose name I didn't get because\nmy pencil broke) left Goldsmiths\nreeling.\nWill they use this ploy again?\nMick Winsor was not sober\nenough for comment, but shouts\nof ' Not af \u2014 ing chance, John' from the referee's changing room would seem to suggest\n(cont. p94). Cycling\nSeven cyclists set out from Beit\nArch at 9 : 3 0 am to Clapham Junction where we met Ian Lacey. We caught a train to\nEpsom to avoid the worst of\nLondon' s traffic, potholes, broken glass and red traffic lights. The guard told us to put\nour bikes in a carriage as there\nwasn't enough room in the\nluggage compartment for himself\nand the bikes.\nWe rode to Cobham and then\nfollowed a windy lane. After a while Ronan wanted to look at\nthe map while still riding his\nfixed-wheel track bike. Little did\nhe know that we were just approaching a short, steep, muddy, winding descent. The\nmap still shows teeth marks where he held the map.\nFurther on we crossed a ford\nin Shere by the footbridge\u2014\nexcept Ronan, who rode through\nthe ford. We stopped in Go m Two miles further on we\nturned off the main road to\nclimb White Downs. The gentle\nprotests of the slight gradient\nsuddenly changed, after taking\nthe hairpin, to a series of gasps\nand groans as they could see the\nsecond half of the hill. This was\nthe only hill of the day. We went\nover Ran more Common and found our way back to Epsom through some very narrow lanes.\nOn our way back from C la pham Ronan continued to entertain us by balancing on his bike\nat red traffic lights. As a finale at\nthe junction opposite the Maths Department, he fell off.\nIC's play.\nThe main problem was, as\nusual, a lack of team co ordination. But is this surprising\nwhen noone listens to the\ncoaching?\nTeam: Brian, Nick, George,\nAlan, Andy, Ian, Ken and Frank.\nCross Country\nFootball\nFifths\nIC vs QM C54Owing to their imminent late\narrival IC changed on the coach,\nleaving the shorts until arrival\ndue to their unwillingness to\nreveal their naughty bits to the\nviewing public. Arriving at the\nground with seconds to spare IC donned the shorts and set off in\nsearch of a pitch. The match,\nshortened to thirty minutes a half, finally got underway. IC son fell one behind, but Nick Low ton equalise d from the\npenalty spot. At half-time IC were 2-1 up due to another goal\nby Nick, who had finally realised\nthat to score a goal he had to put\nthe little white ball between the\nlarge white posts.\nWith five minutes of the\nsecond half remaining QM C were 4-2 up, there was never any\nproblems as IC utilised the seconds remaining to score three\ntimes through Des Hull, Mark Lenczoer and Malcolm Dick, securing their third consecutive\nvictory.\nTeam: Tony, Paul, Phil, Tom,\nMark, Adam, Malcolm, Rob,\nMark L, Nick, Des.\nBasketball\nIC vs Avery Hill 51-62\nThe season hasn't started well,\nbut after a good performance\nagainst St Marys last week we\nwere looking forward to a victory against a weak Avery\nHill squad.\nObserving the teams while warming-up, IC looked by far\nthe better of the two, but we still\nlost! NO excuse can be made this\ntime, it was an absolute sham-ble s. It isn't possible to say\nFELIXI\nNine members of the ci ub made\nthe trip to Reading for the\nWhitenights's Relays with the\nfirst objective of finding the\ncourse. We eventually arrived\nafter a scenic tour of Reading\nand began the serious business\nof picking teams.\nPicking the ladies team was\neasy, we didn't have any ladies,\nbut Hugh Dixon managed to\norganise three spare ladies to run\nfor IC. The club had entered\nthree mens teams so it was\ndecided that three men would\nhave to run twice to make up the\nfour men teams, the lucky volunteers were suitably re named for their second legs.\nSo to the race, Tasso Asteriades ran a fast first leg for the A team, handing over to Hugh Dixon in about13 th. Hugh handed over to Andrew Griffiths\nwho ran well with the team now\nabout tenth. Rob Morrison, after several wrong turns due to\nthe fog, brought the A team in.\nThe B team was led off by\nGraham Harker who handed\nover to Steve Taylor who then\npassed on to Jon Le a.Jon, running well considering his\nrecent injury, handed over to\nHugh Dixon running his second\nleg.\n. The C team was led off by .'on\nFrost (Capt) who handed on to\nKelvin Acford. Tasso Asteriades\non his second leg took over and\nthe team was made u o by\nAndrew Griffiths wh ran another quick leg.\nWednesday the 24th we went\nto Thames Poly for the third\nrace to see if we could keep it up.\nMissing some key runners (they\nknow who they are) the less\ntalented athletes had to excel\nthemselves for us to stand any\nchance of maintaining our position in the league. The course at Thames Poly is classic\ncross country: hilly with lots of\nsticky, smelly mud, and the\nweather was superb: cold and\nwindy. Only the torrential rain\nwas missing to make this the\nperfect day out.\nHugh Dixon( aka H Bomme)\nonly managed to come sixth.\nHard luck Hugh. But Nigel I December 3, 1 9 8 2 HH HH HH HM I Fenwick put on the jet packs to [\nfinish 26th, a big improvement\nfor him. There were rumours of\ndrugs being used but Nigel dispelled these with a quick slash\nfrom his spikes. Mandy Tin dall again finished third in the ladies\nrace but we could do with more\n.ladies. Phil Parr Burman twisted\nhis ankle while running so get\nwell soon Phil.\nOthers stupid enough to attend (in descending IQ) were:\nRobert Morrison, Steve Taylor,\nJon Frost (loyal Capt), Tim Scott,\nGraham Harker, Martin Brown,\nJohn Griffin.\nLadies Rugby\nDoes IC have any aggressive,\nfun-loving, fit or unfit females\nwho are prepared to have a go\nat rugby?

Soon an argument developed as\nto how many of these super kings one could\nplace on a chess board, without any being able\nto take another.

    "content": "Dramsoc's production of 'Butley', by Simon Gray\nRCS Menagerie\nThe Royal College of Science\nUnion's mascot ry team is making\narrangements for the return of\ntwo of the mascots that they have\nviolated over the past year. The\nSchool of Slavonic and East\nEuropean Studies (SSEES) has\naccepted RCSU's terms, but no\nreply has yet been received from\nQueen Mary College.\nS SEES students have agreed\nto buy fifty Rag Mags and to go\ncarol singing in Russell Square\nlater this month; all proceeds\nwill go to RCS Rag funds. It is\ngenerally believed that they have\nbeen let off lightly because of the\nsmall size of this predominantly\nfemale college. Their mascot,\nVelish, is a stuffed Aberdeen\nAngus bull's head and was taken\nfrom its resting place in the\ncanteen earlier this month. According to a spokesman from\nS SEES, it is meant to represent\nthe ( now extinct) Bulgarian Bison, which is an East European\nfertility symbol\u2014but this claim\nshould probably not be taken\ntoo seriously.\nThe QM C mascot, a stuffed\nleopard called Mary, was captured by the RCS last March, and negotiations for her return\nare still in the opening stages. A first demand of fifty pints of\nblood and fifty donations to the\nsperm bank, with 'the proceeds\nto go to the R CSU' has been\nmade, with receipts to be\ndelivered by January 24. No reply has been received yet.\nDried Up\nResidents of the Fremantle Hotel were without water last\nThursday because of a broken\nwater main in the Earl's Court\nRoad. The supply had been\nsevered the previous Tuesday\nbut the large capacity water tank\nat the Fremantle provides water\nfor two days, and the supply was\nreconnected on Friday.\nBrave New\nWorld?\nBritain is entering an era of\nunparalleled wealth and pros-per it y, the Right Honourable\nKenneth Baker told the Indust rial Society on Thursday. Today's students will probably\nundergo several changes of career as a result of the new\nmicro-chip revolution, he said.\nMr Baker was made the first\never Minister for Information\nTechnology in 1980, with responsibility for the electronics,\ntelecommunications and space\nindustries\u2014the only industries.\nFoPSoc\nThwarted\nA letter was sent this week by\nUnion President Stephen Goulder\nto the 'Friends of Palestine'\norganisation, discouraging its\nmembers from displaying publicity around College.\nMr Goulder said that FOP was not one of the Union's constitutional social clubs, since\nit has not undergone the two\nrequired readings from major\ncommittees.\nFOP had been displaying strongly political posters in the\nUnion and the Halls of Residence\nwithout seeking approval from\neither the Honorary Secretary or\nthe Warden. This led to a complaint being forwarded to\nthe Union Executive. The source\nof this complaint was not revealed.\nIn his letter, Mr Gould er pointed out that FOP may become a fully recognised society within ICU by constitutional procedures, but they\nwould still have to abide by\nUnion Publicity Rules and any\nposters deemed offensive would\nnot be allowed on Union pre-mises.\nhe claimed, that will not decline\nover the next twenty years. In\nparticular he will be supervising\nthe establishment of cable television in 1986, which will be\nused not only for entertainment,\nbut for information and home\nbanking services, and even, he\nsuggested, for burglar alarms\nHe also outlined the reasons\nfor ending the British Telecom\nmonopoly, claiming that such a rapidly developing field could\nonly be propelled by competition. If Conservative legislation\nis passed he believes that Telecom will be privatised in the\nnear future.\nHowell of\nBoredom\nThe Government's new Transport Bill will allow for reasonable but not unlimited subsidies\nfor public transport, including\nLondon Transport, the Secretary\nof State for Transport David Howell said in a speech to IC\nConservative Society on Tuesday. This was to ensure a stable\nand consistent level of subsidy\nwith proper balance between the\ninterests of local rate payers and\npaying passengers.\nMr Howell stated the necessity\nto avoid high fares which discouraged people from travelling and high costs to rate payers particularly businesses, which\nresult inclosures and job losses. He stressed the need for a proper balance between these\nfactors combined with long-term\nplanning of transport policy. Without this he claimed the\nsubsidies bill for metropolitan\ntransport authorities would escalate to \u00a3700m next year from\n\u00a3300m this year.\nHe disclosed his sympathy for\nthe view that control of London Transport should be removed\nfrom the GLC and passed to a separate Transport Authority, a.> suggested by a House of Com mons Select Committee. He also\nspoke of the need for an improvement in London's roads.\nMr Howell arrived twenty-five\nminutes late for the meeting,\nblaming traffic congestion in\nLondon for his delay and addressed an audience of about\nsixty. Speaking about recent\nlegislation allowing increased lorry weights, he stated that road\ntransport had developed for the\nlast twenty years without new\nlegislation. The new regulations\nwould reduce lorry damage to\nroads despite increased weights\nby requiring an extra axle on\nheavy lorries, as well as new\nlimits on length, height, noise\nand emissions, along with compulsory under-run guards\nand improved brakes. He also\nstated that the most road damage was caused by 16 ton 2\naxle lorries, and that the new\nweight limits would allow lorries\nto be filled rather than running\nup to a third empty, resulting in\nfewer lorries on the roads.\nLSE Out?\nStudents at the London School\nof Economics came close to\nrefusing to pay their \u00a312,000\naffiliation fee to the National\nUnion of Students last week. At Monday's routine union meeting,\na motion proposing that the\nmoney should be spent on a racehorse attracted a majority of\nthe votes.\nBut the LSE will remain affiliated to the NUS because a two-thirds majority is required\non all financial matters. It also\nseems likely that the motion was\noutside the powers of the\nconstitution because the students'\nunion is (for tax purposes) a registered charity.\nSirs' Pleas\nBill Sirs, General Secretary of\nthe Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, called for the\ninitiation of import controls to\nprotect home industries, when\nhe spoke to the Industrial Society on Tuesday.\nMost of Mr Sirs' s address\nconcerned his job as a Trade\nUnion leader, but not unexpectedly he took time off to\ncriticise the Conservative Government's industrial policy. He also gave an insight into the day-to-day running of the Labour\nParty; Mr Sirs was instrumental\nin the switch to a more moderate\nexecutive earlier this year.\nFELIX December 3, 1982 Page 3\n\n"

    "content": "Human Rights Week\nDuring the next seven days, a whole range of clubs and societies will be\ngetting together with the aim of making members of the College more\naware of violations of human rights in the world. The result is Human\nRights Week, being held under the auspices of the Social Clubs\nCommittee.\nThroughout the next week there will be speakers and films on various\naspects of human rights. On Thursday there is a Human Rights Fair in\nthe J CR at which clubs will be represented by displays and stalls.\nFurther details are given later.\nIt is all too easy to accuse governments which are of a different\npolitical or religious persuasion of human rights violations while\nignoring those carried out by one's own. The United Kingdom government has been found guilty by the European Commission of\nHuman Rights, in recent years, of torturing prisoners in its gaols,\nrestricting press freedom, restricting people's right not to join a trade\nunion and having subjected criminals to degrading punishment.\nCitizens of this country, however, do have some form of remedy\nagainst their government. People in some countries are not so\nfortunate.\nHuman Rights Week is a way of informing you of their plight. At the very least the Week will remind those who live in free countries,\nlike the UK, how lucky they are and of the need for constant\nvigilance to defend their cherished freedoms.\nEVENTS All Week\nLunchtimes JCR\nWest London Chaplaincy members will be urging you to write\nto your MP to stop British companies exporting equipment\nthat can be used for torture. One\nsuch piece of equipment, a shock baton, offered to customers (including representatives\nof the Chilean junta) at the\nBritish Army Equipment Exhibition was described as 'ideal for\nuse in penal institutions' and\n'produces about 4,000 volts but\nwith very low current to avoid\nburns or permanent injury' and\nwould almost certainly be used\nfor torturing.\nTuesday\n1:00pm Civ Eng 201\n'The Cyprus Problem' A talk by\nthe Cultural Attac he to the Cypriot Embassy in London, organised by the Cypriot Society.\n1:15pm ME 220\nAn eyewitness account of the\ndestruction of Lebanon during\nthe recent Israeli occupation, by\ntwo Oxfam relief workers, Pam and Derek Cooper, organised by\nthe Islamic Society.\n1:30pm Physics LT1\nAmnesty International are showing the film Lines to\nFreedom.

(Grossly Overweight Union Leader....)\nSO MANY doctors' receptionists take pride in being as\nobstructively officious as p ossi ble; such a relief then, to find\nthat those at the College Health\nCentre are about as helpful, charming and efficient as it is\npossible to be. Still, even Homer nods, as they say, and I was\namused to hear a story about\nsomeone who phoned up the\nHealth Centre to ask if it would\nbe possible to book an appointment with Dr Tony Haines. Since Tony had recently left to\ntake up his new job, the receptionist replied that she was sorry\nbut ' Dr Haines is no longer with\nus.'\nThere was a slightly embarrassed pause before the caller\nreplied ' Oh dear, I am sorry...1\nhad no idea' and then hung up,\nclearly under the impression that\n\u2022 ii it iii iii iii iii I_L iiii iii it iiii iiii III iii iT i \u2022 \u2022 1 \u2022 I1 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 1 \u2022 II \u2022 IT II \u2022 1 1\nIII III IIII III III1 III1 It IIII IIII_ i~i~i~ rr i \"ri~i~t\" i~i_ ri~i~i~i_ i_i_i_ i_i_i,i_ i~i~i_ ri~ri\"i_t\" i'\"i~i~ i~i~i~ i\\~~~\\~\\~\\ii iii \u2022 iii iiI IiI.I Tony had been called to much\nhigher service.\nANOTHER COUPLE of stories\nfrom the Health Centre, this\ntim e from a splendid freebie\ngiven by the staff to introduce us\nUnion hacks lot he Health Centre people, and in particular\nto Alan Swann, the new doctor.\nStephen Gould er was there, of course, having come from several other receptions during\nthe day, a drink in the bar at\nlunchtime and the Union sherry\nhour at six o 'clock; consequently\nhe was more than a little the\nworse for alcohol, and when he\ncame to introduce the Deputy\nPreis dent and the Honorary Secretary of the Union, he forgot\nnot one but both of their names.\nBut for me the most ironic\nincident of the evening was the\nabsence of Dr Swann himself,\nwho had left work at lunchtime\nthat day. Reason? He wasn't feeling well!\nONE DAY I really must meet\nGareth Fish and find out just\nwhy (or how) he keeps getting\ninvolved in such curious predicaments. This week's escapade\nFELIX1 I December 3, 19821\nconcerns two photographs I have been given of said Mr Fish\nwithout clothing in the Union Bar. In one of them he is being\nforcibly held down in a spread-eagle posture for heaven knows\nwhat purpose, and in the other\nhe is locked in an embrace with\nthe Rag Mag's pneumatic advertising manager, Leah Phelps.\nI have refused to print the photos in the interest of pubic\ndecency.\nI DON'T KNOW what some\npeople expect of a newspaper.\nMike Mac Clancy, subject of several anecdotes in this column\nlast week, came to see me last\nFriday full of merriment and\nlaughter. Why, he wanted to\nknow, had I missed out some of\nhis grossest cock-ups? He went\non to detail several more stories\nagainst himself, all of which caused much hilarity among the\nFELIX staff.\nIt was a very different Mr Mac Clancy who came to see me\nlater in the week, quite outraged\nthat I was actually considering\nprinting more stories about him. Still, I 've spelt his name right\nthis week, so he hasn't got quite\nso much to grumble at.\nIPage7\n\n"
