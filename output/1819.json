Here,\n\u201cfreedom of speech\u201d is defined as in\nthe European Convention on Human\nRights: \u201cfreedom to hold opinions and\nto receive and impart information and\nideas without interference by public\nauthority and regardless of frontiers.\u201d\nThe bill aims to \u201cstrengthen and\nextend\u201d this existing legislation and,\nnovelly, also place these duties upon\nstudent unions. Furthermore, higher\neducation regulators will be allowed\nto fine institutions failing to protect\nfreedom of speech.\nMonday 23rd January marked the\nfirst day of strikes for the Spring\nTerm. This saw joint striking from\nImperial\u2019s branches of UCU and Unite,\non the issue of the 2022 pay award. A\nsecond joint strike day has also been\nannounced for 1st February.\nUCU also announced on 24th January\na set of 18 days of national strike action\nover pay and pensions.\nThe marking and assessment boycott\ninitially planned for January has\nbeen called off. Instead, the UCU\u2019s\nHigher Education Committee is\nlooking to \u201cstrategically target summer\ngraduations\u201d, suggesting a boycott in\nApril or May.\nImperial College London is one\nof the few universities where pay is\ndecided locally instead of nationally,\nwhich disqualifies Imperial UCU from\nfollowing other UCU branches across\nthe United Kingdom, unless they\nannounce these strikes individually.\nFelix has not yet received clarification\non which of these 18 days are specifically\nfornationalpay,andwhichstrikesareon\npensions.\nImperial Unite members told Felix\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to organise extended strikes, as\nour members simply can\u2019t afford to not\nwork, despite our strike pay fund.\u201d Both\nMusic: M.J. on fire! > page 5\nSport: Wins all around > page 7\nISSUE 1819\nFounded 1949\nFRIDAY 27TH JANUARY 2023\nFelix@ic.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nFelix\nFreedom of speech bill places new\nresponsibility on student unions\nAmeena Hassan Editor-in-Chief\nContinued on page 3...\nSpring Term sees increased striking\nIsabella Ward News Writer\nContinued on page 3...\nCredit: Collage by Felix .

    "content": "FRIDAY 27TH JANUARY 2023\n3\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nNEWS\nFreedom of speech in UK\nuniversities\nThe Academic Freedom Index\nindicates that over the past\ndecade, feelings of academic\nfreedom within UK universities have\ndeclined (see figure). The government\ncommitted to cracking down on campus\n\u201ccancel culture\u201d in 2021, with then\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson\nbringing the bill forward in the hopes\nthat it would eradicate what he called\nunlawful \u201csilencing\u201d and thus \u201ccounter\nthe chilling effect of censorship on\ncampus once and for all.\u201d\nNew duties\nThe bill first seeks to \u201csecure freedom\nofspeechwithinthelawfortheprovider\u2019s\nmembers, staff and students and for\nvisiting speakers\u201d by mandating that\nhighereducationproviders\u201ctakestepsto\nachieve\u201d this. It bestows on universities a\nduty to develop and maintain a \u201ccode of\npractice\u201d as described:\n\u201cThe content code of practice must\ninclude a statement of the provider\u2019s\nvalues relating to freedom of speech\nand an explanation of how those values\nuphold freedom of speech. It must also\nset out the procedures to be followed\nby staff, students and any students\u2019\nunion for students at the provider when\norganising meetings and activities, the\nconduct required in relation to such\nmeetings and activities, and the criteria\nfor specified decisions.\u201d\nFurthermore, the bill now proposes\nthat universities should not just protect,\nbut\u201cactivelypromote\u201d,freedomofspeech\nand, in particular, academic freedom for\nstaff.\nInitially, the bill proposed to allow\nindividuals to bring civil proceedings\nagainst universities failing to uphold\nthese new responsibilities of protecting\nfree speech. However, this was removed\nin December last year due to concerns\nthat the fear of litigation could \u2013\ncounterproductively \u2013 reduce free\nspeech in universities.\nAmendments made in December also\nbantheuseofnon-disclosureagreements\n(NDAs) for complaints of sexual abuse,\nharassment or misconduct, or other\nbullying or harassment. An NDA would\nprevent the individual from disclosing\nor publishing information about the\nrelevant complaint to any one or more\nother persons.\nImpact on students\u2019 unions\nNotably, the bill will see the legal\nresponsibilities described above\nalso placed on student unions. Unions\nfound breaching these duties would\nlikewise face sanctions.\nIn particular, the duty would enforce\non unions that \u201cthe use of any premises\noccupied by the students\u2019 union is not\nrefusedbecauseofaperson\u2019sideas,beliefs\nor views, or a body\u2019s policy or objectives\u201d\nand that \u201caffiliation to the students\u201d\nunionisnotdeniedtoanystudentsociety\nonthosegrounds.Thisaimstotacklethe\nhotly debated (yet infrequent) instances\nof \u201cno-platforming\u201d, where individuals\nororganisationsaredeniedaplatformto\nspeak(forexample,AmberRuddbyUN\nWomen Oxford UK in 2020).\nRegulator: the Office for Students\nThe Office for Students (OfS) will\nact as a regulator to oversee institutions\u2019\ndischarging of obligations. Any alleged\nbreach of these news duties will be\ninvestigated by a newly created Director\nfor Freedom of Speech and Academic\nFreedom. One of the mechanisms for\nthis includes a new complaints scheme\nfor students, staff and visiting speakers\nwho feel they have been suffered as a\nresult of such a breach.\nAlthough the bill has not yet reached\nRoyal Assent, the OfS has already\nbegun to set the wheels in motion for\nmonitoring freedom of speech across\ncampuses in England. The National\nStudentSurvey,senttofinal-yearstudents\nlast week, now features a question for\nstudents at English universities on the\nextent to which they feel free to express\nthemselves at university.\nResponses thus far\n\u201cCancel culture\u201d is a contentious\nissue, and the extent to which it is\na threat on campuses is an ongoing\ndebate. There are criticisms that the bill\ntakes the wrong approach: the\nUniversity and College Union UCU\nbriefing on the Bill states that it \u201cwill\ndo nothing to address the real threats\nto academic freedom, which are widely\nunderstood to be the use of precarious\nemployment practices that prevent staff\nfrom researching and working freely, a\nlack of staff representation in university\ngovernance, and a management culture\nwhich dictates the research academics\nundertake\u201d. Nevertheless, the banning of\nNDAs has been well-received.\nThere are concerns regarding the\nbill\u2019s heavy-handed governance of\nstudent unions. Some fear that it could\nencourage students unhappy with\nunion decisions concerning them to\ncomplain that their views are being\ndiscriminated against. The bill may also\nforce student unions to reconsider some\nof their election practices, where certain\ntypes of speech (i.e., criticising other\ncandidates) are banned. However, some\nrelief will be felt amongst institutions\nnow that the \u201cfrightening\u201d prospect of\ncivil proceedings against them has been\ndropped.\nIn 2021, then Universities Minister\nMichelle Donelan said: \u201cThis Bill will\nensure universities not only protect free\nspeech but promote it too. After all how\ncan we expect society to progress or for\nopinions to modernise unless we can\nchallenge the status quo?\u201d`\nImperial UCU and Imperial Unite have\nfunds to support members who go on\nstrike.\nThe Imperial UCU Strike Organiser\nnoted on Monday that there were fewer\nin-personattendeesthanatearlierstrikes\nin November. The picket line started\nslightly after 8am in the morning in -5C\nweather, and picketers left the Imperial\nCollege Road entrance at just before\nnoon, when the temperatures had risen\nto -2C.\nFelix spoke to picketers at the picket\nline, who admitted: \u201cWe do tend to\nhave better attendance in better weather,\nbut strikers have increasingly chosen to\nattendonlineinstead,astheycan\u2019tafford\nthe travel costs.\u201d Another picketer said\nthat he found the picket line beneficial\nto intersectional research, as they had\nwritten papers with fellow researchers\nthey had met on the picket line.\nBefore the additional 18 days were\nannounced, a picketer said \u201cIt feels like\nthis is going to go on for a while, not\n...continued from page 1\n...continued from page 1\nIncreasing strike action\nStrike Dates UCU National Strike Action\n30 Jan - 3 Feb 1 February\n6 Feb - 10 Feb 9 - 10 Feb\n13 Feb - 17 Feb 14 - 16 Feb\n20 Feb - 24 Feb 21 - 23 Feb\n27 Feb - 3 Mar 27 Feb - 2 Mar\n6 Mar - 10 Mar - No strikes -13 Mar - 17 Mar 16 - 17 Mar\n20 Mar - 24 Mar 20 - 22 Mar\nresolved quickly at all.

She spends the rest of the single both mourning\nandreminiscingaboutherpastsignificantother.Eloise\nishurt,isdesperatelyhookedonhim,andlooksforhim\nin every man she meets - trust me it\u2019s not a good place\nto be. This song just gets me in some way. She wants\nhim back, even if she\u2019s admitting it\u2019s not the best thing\nfor either of them. I love her voice, the instrumenta-tion, overall feel of this. PLEASE listen to it - especially\nif you like getting drunk on flights.\nTLDR: Eloise gets drunk on a plane and is mourning\nher recent heartbreak. Sad but in a sonically pleasing\nway.\n\u2018RELOAD!\u2019 feat. WHOKILLED XIX by\nEzekiel\nLet me preface by saying I used to blast WHOKILLEDXIX\u2019s \u2018CUM\u2019 ALL. THE. DAMN. TIME. so\nit is no surprise that I am really REALLY enjoying this\nsingle. Mancunian Ezekiel teams up with previously\nmentioned WHOKILLEDXIX to drop a headbanger.\nIt\u2019s hard, its gritty, its messy, and whilst it could use a\ntiny touch of refinement, it has a grip on me which I\ncan\u2019t describe. I feel so powerful walking literally anywhere to this. The track wastes no time and starts the\nbeat off hard and nasty, before going into what feels\nlike a boss fight. AH I just feel so badass listening, even\nif I don\u2019t completely know what is being said in the\ntrack.\nTLDR: I must now look into Ezekiel\u2019s discog. If you like\n\u2018CUM\u2019 it is a must listen.\n\u2018Count of Three (You Can Eat $#@!)\u2019 by\nunderscores\nunderscores\u2019 new single signifies the final piece of\ntheir\u2018fishmonger\u2019era(whichyoushouldlistentoallthe\nprevious bits of). \u2018Count of Three\u2019 is Devon\u2019s self-pro-claimed \u201c$1m pop song\u201d. All I can say is the aim was\nachieved and it is catchy catchy. The track opens with\na stripped down backing of guitar and bass, with Devon\u2019s signature distorted lyricism. Drums kick in [you\u2019ll\nget the joke when you listen to the song [it\u2019s a terrible\njoke]], and we find out that Devon feels punished by\na potential person who they\u2019re talking to. Well guess\nwhat, that person can \u201ceat shiiii-iiii-iiiit\u201d, as they say in\nthe danceable chorus. This song is so cathartic and is\nso fun to listen to. Instead of banging my head up and\ndown like I would for most of the \u2018fishmonger\u2019 era, I\nfind myself grooving left and right. I\u2019m glad I could\ncatch a bit more underscores this year after being so\ninto their two previous albums. If there\u2019s one lesson we\ncould learn from \u2018Count of Three\u2019, it\u2019s that we should all\ntell people we don\u2019t like to eat shit.\nTLDR: tell that person to eat shit, and listen to this song\nwhilst doing it.\n\u2018Like..?\u2019 by Ice Spice\nI\u2019m not gonna lie, I heard Spice\u2019s \u2018Munch (Feelin\u2019\nU)\u2019 first on TikTok. Whilst it took me a while to fully\ncommit and listen to her on Spotify, I am really happy\nI did. Bronx\u2019s Ice Spice comes at us with her debut EP\nLike..? (her signature adlib) and like damn, its pretty\nfun. She opens the EP with Jersey club beat \u2018In Ha\nMood\u2019 where Ice Spice enjoys herself at a party, and I\u2019m\ngonna be enjoying it too if it sounds like this. I\u2019m not\nsure if it\u2019s just me, but I\u2019ve been getting so many TikToks about Ice Spice being the late Princess Di rein-carnated, the people\u2019s princess. Spice caught onto that,\nreleasing \u2018Princess Diana\u2019, where she declares that \u201cIn\nthe hood, (she\u2019s) like Princess Diana.\u201d \u2018Bikini Bottom\u2019\nis a certified bop, it feels like a guilty pleasure. Whilst\nthis isn\u2019t the BEST sounding record, it has no problem\nin getting me hooked, for slay reasons and culture rea-sons. Overall I\u2019m pretty into it. \u201cHow could I lose if\nI\u2019m already chose\u201d are my new words to live by - thanks\nIce Spice.\nTLDR: TikTok\u2019s people\u2019s princess, Ice Spice, does it\nagain. Listen to \u2018Munch (Feelin\u2019 U)\u2019\nBubblegum by Biig Piig\nIfirstexperiencedBiigPiigwhilsttheywereopening\nfor Glass Animals back in Dec 2021 at Ally Pally. I was\ncaptivated by their stage presence, and just how much\nfun their set was. \u2018Feels Right\u2019 described the feeling of\nletting go on a night out, backed by a groovy bassline.\nIt just \u201cfeels right\u201d, ya kno. \u2018Switch\u2019, another banger,\ndescribes the pressure put onto the world, and how\nit\u2019s all falling apart. Despite the desolate and anxious\nundertones, it still bangs hard. Biig Piig would be one\nto watch for me. Fast forward to now, Biig Piig Amsterdam tickets secured and a new album to listen to\n- life is great. If I could describe this mixtape with one\nword, it would be FUN. She opens with \u2018Only One\u2019,\nwith punchy bass and an airy voice, pleading the one\nshe loves to stay. \u2018Kerosene\u2019 is groovy and sounds exactly like what she wants to describe, the ecstasy of a new\nflame. It\u2019s possibly my favourite from the album. She\ndoesn\u2019t shy away from straightforward balladry either,\n\u2018Ghosting\u2019 does this in English AND in Spanish. Props\nto our bilingual queen. I really like this record, but I\nfeel like I wanted a bit more from it, especially with its\n18-minute runtime. Nevertheless, I\u2019m sure this\u2019ll hit\nlive in a couple month\u2019s time.\nTLDR: Biig Piig\u2019s Bubblegum pops off. Listen to \u2018Kerosene\u2019.\n\n"

    "content": "On a rather rainy Wednesday in the limbo between Christmas and New Year\u2019s, my cousin\nrecommended an album that would become a new favourite in the weeks to come: the debut album Guard\nDog from indie-folk newcomer Searows.\nWritten, recorded, produced and mixed by Alec\nDuckart in the crawlspace under his house, the album,\nreleased on September 30th, 2022, has an artfully\ncohesive sound that is both acoustic and delicate.\nThough the album may not be upbeat in its lyricism,\nAlec creates a ruminative yet comforting collection\nof songs loaded with introspective imagery, hushed\nintimacy, and acoustic strums \u2014 the quietly resolute\nsound of a man left alone with a guitar, a mic and\nhis thoughts. While his vocal timbre is similar to\nthat of Phoebe Bridgers, the way he utilises his mild,\ndiaphanous vibrato to sustain notes is highly unique,\ncreating an emotion-inducing, delicate, and powerful\nperformance that pairs beautifully with his impressive\nfinger-work on acoustic guitar.\nLyrically, the album represents a look into some\npersonal relationships in his life, poetically, candidly\nandsomberlyemotingontheintricaciesandintimacies\nof human relationships against a backdrop of warm,\nsensitive guitar for a simple yet devasting effect. First\nreleased as a single in July, \u2018Used to Be Friends\u2019 truly\nencompasses the direction Alec is taking this project.\nThe track describes a complicated toxic friendship\nwith intertwined romantic feelings along with the\nfeelings of obligation, longing and pain that\ncame with it. Opening with an enchanting\nacoustic chord progression layered over a\ndistant soft horn, the artist creates a tender\nsound reminiscent of Novo Amor or Bon\nIver. Alec proceeds to explain a situation\nin which he rejected this romantic\ninterest for his own well-being and\nhad to continue battling with this\nperson\u2019s constant pining. Each\nchorus closes with the line \u201cWe\nused to be friends\u201d which he\npoignantly sustains, holding\nthe note long enough to\ndrive that absence home,\nmaking his vocals as much\na purely sonic instrument\nas his guitar. The song\nis a powerful reminder\nthat the lasting impact\nfelt after relationships\nend, even the tough,\ncomplicated ones, isn\u2019t singular. We should take time\nto reflect on these times and appreciate the lessons\nthey taught us.\n\u2018Haunted\u2019 is a track that almost makes you hold\nyour breath. Its gentle chords guide you through a\ntragic story of loss and loneliness with Alec asking\n\u201cDon\u2019t you ever wish the house was haunted?\u201d These\nqualities lure you in with their softness and leave you\nwith goosebumps. The album closes with \u2018Crybaby\u2019, a\nsong containing some of the saddest lines I heard in\nany song last year: \u201cI wanna stay alive/I do, I do, I do/\nAt least I try to want to.\u201d\nThe production and composition of the album\nare incredibly well done and the lyricism is so\nheartbreakingly raw and descriptive that any song\nwill hit close to your heart. While it\u2019s a powerful and\nemotional album, it\u2019s also a reminder of the familiar\nmelancholic indie-folk sound that so many of us love.\nIt may have been close to the end of the year when I\nfirst listened, but I am so glad this album didn\u2019t pass\nme by.\n5\nMusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by Joe Riordan &\nTara Pal Chaudhuri\nMusic\nSearows release debut, Guard Dog\nAmy Smith Music Writer\nAlbum Reviews\nFRIDAY 27TH JANUARY 2023\nA beautiful yet beautiful debut from Portland indie-rocker, Searows\nDon\u2019t Miss the Gig\nLMS Acoustic Night @ Union\nBar,Tuesday 31st January\nKickbackwithImperial\u2019sownacousticacts.\nThink a little stool, a corner stage, Union\nBar\u2019s warm wooden beer-scented chic (am\nI selling this?), and lots of guitars.

Rhea and Emma W were on\nthe bench, ready to come on to help the\nteam.\nWe played well in the first half, but\nBirmingham were very fast and decisive\nat set pieces and scored from free kicks\nand corners.\nFollowing a team discussion and some\nstrategic substitutions at half time, we\nwent into the second half heads held\nhigh and ready to give it our all, keeping our good defensive shape while being faster on the\nball and creating\nmore chances.\nThe second\nhalf was more\neven, with both\nteams looking\ndangerous. Each\nteam was getting\ncloser and closer to the goal.\nIt was Birmingham who found\nthe net first with a well-taken free kick.\nICWFC kept playing at the same high\nlevel, and ended up scoring a wonderful\nteamgoalstartedfromthebackline,and\nfinished beautifully by Sofia C. It is the\nfirst goal ever scored by ICWFC in the\nTrophy Cup.\nThe loss means that unfortunately\nthey will not qualify for the next round;\nhowever, ICWFC is proud of their performance against a team of such high\ncalibre, with far more resources and experience in the top leagues.\nCoach Sally said to the team, \u201cThere\nare a lot of positives to take from the\nperformance, especially from the second half. I think individually there were\nsome really good games and I\u2019m proud\nof how far you\u2019ve come from the start of\nthe season. Our goal was an absolutely\nfantastic team effort \u2013 and what a great\nfinish from Sofia!\u201d\nThe focus is now on winning the\nthree league games remaining with the\nhopes of finishing in podium position.\nICWFC is only getting better year after\nyear, breaking records and climbing up\nthe leagues. It has now become one of\nthe biggest clubs at Imperial with almost\n100 members. It has been amazing to\nwitness such rising interest in women\u2019s\nfootball, especially after the Lionesses\u2019\nwin in the Women\u2019s Euros this summer.\nFRIDAY 27TH JANUARY 2023\n7\nSport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nWomen\u2019s Football makes history\nEdited by: Isabella Ward\nSocieties&Sport\nMen\u2019s II beat rivals UCL\n12-5 in table tennis\nLayana Safieddine\nICWFC I Team Captain\n\u201cOUR GOAL WAS\nAN ABSOLUTELY\nFANTASTIC TEAM\nEFFORT AND\nGREAT FINISH\nFROM SOFIA!\nImperial\u2019s Table Tennis Men\u2019s II comfortably beat UCL Men\u2019s II 12-5 in\ntheir first match of the calendar year.\nSecuring a win in their third-final match\nof the league was crucial for the team,\nwho were previously in a four-way tie between teams in the South Eastern Tier I\nBUCS League.\nUCL had beaten us in our previous\nfaceoff; however we were inspired by\nthe success of our Men\u2019s I in the Premier\nDivision earlier that day, who had won\ntheir match against Swansea 10-7.\nRajiv Padman, Kiarash Shaddel and\nAlex Chen Hu were joined by the remarkable Peter Hatfaludi, who arrived\ndue to a last-minute change.\nFor the readers that might not be familiar with the BUCS table tennis competition format (because every fresher\nthat joins the teams has a hard time understanding it), the match itself consists\nof 16 individual matches where each one\nof us plays against each opponent. The\ntiebreaker is a doubles match that gets\nplayed at the end. Therefore, winning\nnine of these is enough to bring us the\nwin. Players are lined up according to\ntheir rankings and start playing in reverse ranking order. This means that the\nbalanced matches are supposed to happen in the latter stages of the competi-tion.\nThe game started with victories for\nour top two players and losses for our\nlast two: no surprises there. The second round resulted in better scores for\nImperial as prodigy Peter surprisingly\nmanaged to beat UCL\u2019s second player.\nIn one of three wins secured by him that\nnight, Peter delivered a remarkable 3-2\ngame against the UCL student, who was\nspeechless after all the spinny lobs from\nIC Women\u2019s Football place pressure on Birmingham\nPeter.\nA very consistent Kiarash was able to\nprove himself as usual by bringing the\nteam three points after barely letting his\nfourth match escape. His match experience allows him to consistently secure\nwins for ICTT as he travels across the\nUK to play competitions. A player who\nhas the devotion to come all the way\nfrom Oxford to play his matches not\nonly shows commitment and comradery\nbut is also sure to impress even veterans\nof the sport.\nWith Team Captain Alex also con-cedinghislastmatch,itwasverytightup\nuntil the beginning of the third round.\nMorale was high as Imperial was leading\nby a close 5-3. The team embraced this\nopportunity to deliver a kill and win all\nfour matches in this round and secure\nthe win. The analytical skills came to\nlight during the doubles, with Alex and\nRajiv taking the UCL pair. Much like\nhow they played their first ever doubles\nmatch this year in BUCS Nationals at\nNottingham, they were able to finish the\nclash that saw these two London universities meet with a 3-2 win, including\nan 11-1 set with Alex scoring at least 4\npoints after hitting the net.\nAlex Chen Hu\nIC Table Tennis Men\u2019s II Team Captain\n\n"

    "content": "After suffering a close defeat to St\nMary\u2019s 1s last November, Imperial\nCollege Union Netball Club (ICUNC)\n3s were looking to settle the score and\nsnatch away St Mary\u2019s current second\nposition in their BUCS league. With\nIC 3s being on the last podium position,\nthey needed to secure the win to steal\nthe silver.\nThe eight-person line-up consisted of\na formidable shooting trio (Amelie Siew,\nIman Shaikh and Mia Yap), a daunting\ncentre court set up (Sophie Mosselmans,\nLorna Macrae and Vania Lay as WA, C,\nWD respectively) and an unrelenting\ndefensive duo (Nadia Cooper and Holly\nBennett).\nThe first half of the game saw the\nevenly matched teams fight hard, with\nIC relying on their speed and agility to\nmatchthesignificantlytalleropposition.\nDespite consistent displays of tight defence and expert shooting, at half time\nIC were four goals down. The team regrouped and strategised that they would\nexploit the fast pace of their gameplay\nto come back. This paid off: IC scored\n12 goals in the third quarter, closing the\ngap and bringing the score to 26-27. In\nthe final quarter, IC dominated with 10\nturnovers and 14 goals, concluding the\ngame with a definitive 40-31 victory.\nLooking ahead, IC 3s are facing\nBrunel Women\u2019s 5s next week for the\nfirst time this season- the team who currently sit just below IC 3s in the league.\nThere was much cause for celebration\nat IC Netball this Wednesday as IC 1s\nbeat St George\u2019s 1s 42-29.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n8 Sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nSPORT\nSeojung Park\nICSM Netball III Team Captain\nImperial gives UCL a runaround\nICSM Netball III go to goal\nICSM Netball III victor\nover West London 44-32\nWant your matches\nfeatured in Felix?\nIf you want Felix to photograph and\nreport on your matches, please get\nin touch.

Meanwhile, Imperial gameplay remained tight: passes\nwere quick between attackers Georgina, Inez and Immy, with players\ndriving the ball into space. There were\ndisplays of impressive shooting from\nPatrycja and Captain Seojung. By the\nend of the first quarter, Imperial had\nestablished an eight-goal lead.\nWhen it started to rain in the second\nquarter, team morale remained high.\nIntensity heightened as interceptions\nfrom both sides led to more turnovers\nand West London fought hard to close\nthe gap. However, the opposition defence began to concede more penalties\nwhich our scorers, including Sara, easily converted into goals.\nAt half time, most of the decisions\nmade were related to space and utilising channels more. The Medics also\nrealised that during each quarter, the\nopposition would choose a part of the\ncourt to focus on and to put pressure\non, and as long as at the start of each\nquarter we figured it out quickly, it\nwould lead to our victory.\nBoth teams came back fighting for\nthe ball with increased aggression, as\na high number of intereceptions and\nthus turnovers made for an exciting\ngame. Despite the franticness of the\nopposition, our defence combination\nof Caroline, Onyi and Justina managed to hold their ground.\nThe match concluded with a 44-32\nvictory to the Medics, who now sit in\njoint second position in their league.\nVania Lay\nWoman of the Match\n\n"
