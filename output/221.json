At present they have about six girls\ninterested in learning the sport and equip ing themselves for the fray of I.C. hops. But these girls take their sport seriously, in spite of being handicapped\nby a shortage of space.\nWith 70 new members this season\nspace is at a premium and the club\nhas applied to A.C.C. for extra mats\nso that they can use the South Side\nroom as well for separate women's practices, and maybe encourage some\nof the more timid l.C. girls to go\nalong.\nMen's Win\nOur successful men's team, mean-while, has been fighting to maintain\nlast year's high standard. They defeated both Exeter and Southampton\nby a greater margin than aU.L, team\ncould do, despite the loss this year of\nKeith Dugdale, a black belt.\nThe present team was unlucky to lose\nto a strong L.S.E. tea-T the following\nSaturday. Surprise of the match came\nfrom Keith Glover, an I.C. blue belt\nwho convincingly defeated one of\nL.S.E.' s two black belts\u2014a Japanese.\nThis however was not enough to prevent us from losing by only 7 points.\nSaturday's Sport\nReading U.2.

C1\nBEIT BIKES\nCONTRARY TO the statement in\nthe last Late News. Mr. Henry, the\nChief Security Officer, has not been\nauthorised to dispose of the bicycles\nunder Beit Hall. However, it is reported that these b ika sheds will be\nclosed for a year.\nSportlight\nPULLING OUR WEIGHT\nAS THE SIZE of the college increases each year our participation\nin University events seams to vary in inverse proportion. This\nis not quite so true in the sporting field, but even here there is\noften an understandable reluctance on the part of captains to see\ntheir best players disappear, for all but Cup matches, to U.L. teams. This is the time of year when U.L. final selections are\nbeing made and players not \" spotted \" by the University now will\nprobably not wear the purple vest at all this year.\n[However much of a loss such players seem at the time, in the long term U.L. participation can only benefit the college. Our best athletes and sportsmen\nwill only improve by competing at the highest possible level and their\nimprovement will spread back through the club.\nAt Last\nSTART is being made on the Sports Centre! After nearly three years\ndelay work is at last getting under way\u2014there is a small pile of bricks\non die North Side site and work will start in earnest on filling in the\nhole. Amongst the facilities to be provided are a swimming pool, squash\ncourts, a rifle range, and, of a}l things, a spectator's gallery and toilets.\nThere has been little consultation as to what the students themselves\nrequire. In fact even when the centre is complete there will still be fewer\nfacilities per student than there were in the past, before all the new building\nbegan.\nby Frank Hobson\nCross Country\nTOUGH RELAY DRAWING ON TEAMS from as\nfar away as Leeds and Birmingham\nthe U.C. re!ay provides an exciting\nstart to each Cross Country season.\nThe present I.C. team did not expect\nto win any cups against such strong\nOpposition as Loughborough and\nBorough Road but there was a good\nchance of improving last years 13th place. Hopes fell however as Canadian Pete Schudderboom running 1st leg for I.C. suffered the consequences of a Mooney lunch and only just\nmanaged to stagger home in 25th place\nbefore crawling away to slowly die.\nFighting back\nFortunes though were quickly restored by Howard Smith, a fresher,\nwho ran,a fine second leg to bring us\nback into 12th place. That position\nwas maintained thorough stages 3 and\n4 and Ian Jones with joint best time\nfor the team moved up to 10th place\non the 5th leg leaving the Captain to\nbring us to a final 11th place also\nwith joint best time. In spite of only\nmoving up one place the average time\nper man improved by over 20 sees.\nPurple Vests\nThis time ol the year the club seems\nto go nowhere else but Hampstead\nHeath and the following week we were\nagain off to the hills and mud of\nParliament Hill\u2014this time for six\nmiles of it in a battle for League\npoints and U.L. places. In a race\nwhere Pete Yates, a Cross Country\ninternational, could only come second\nthe standard was high and club captain Howard Dickson ran well to\nfinish 18th out of 170 and gain a place in the U.L. second team. With\nPete Schudderboom, this time foregoing his Mooney, finding some of\nhis true form the team managed to\nfinish well up.\nTHE PULTENEY BOOKSHOP\nis the best bookshop in the whole world\n\u2014\":\nDEFENCE\nLACKING\nIN THE FOUR important matches\nplayed so far this term, I. C.1st team\nhas performed rather worse than in\nprevious years. Against two admittedly strong club sides, Mer'on\nand West Essex, a drastic 9 goals were\nconceded. In each case the defence\nfailed to provide an adequate answer\nto the enthusiastic, if not skilful forward lines.\nThe story against college sides is,\nof course, quite different; for so far\nthe team has beaten L.S.E.40 and\ndrawn with a strong Kinfjs side 0-0.\nThe second match was clearly the\nmore exciting, as in the first L.S.E. were not too sure of their positional\nplay : I.C. forwards Hough and Price\nwere gradually allowed to force their\nway deeper into the opposition lines,\nand it as encouraging to see some sort\nof positional understanding between\nthe two.\nAs a result Hough scored a good\ngoal point before half-time ; and Price\nscored twice later on with two shorts\nof the highest calibre. Finally Allen\nscored a splendid goal past the\nkeeper's right hand after a25 yard\nsolo run.\nTed Needham and Hay Phillips.\nWEST LONDON OFFSET requires\nhelp of several students on\n\" WEDNESDAY\nevenings: 5/- an hour.

This was one of the\nobservations heard at the meeting of the Aetherius Society on\nMonday, 25th October,\nThe talk was given by the founder\nof the Society who was given his information by the voices of space.\nThe speaker detailed the history of\nman, beginning with his occupation of\nthe planet between Mars and Jupiter.\nThe discovery of thermonuclear power;\npower from the hydrogen atom releasing all its energy instead of the\nmere fraction available today, destroyed their world when an atom of\nhydrogen was exploded\u2014completely\ni is integrating the planet.\nMillions of life streams were released\ninto the astral world through this\n;at a strophe.

Again, atomic power was\ndiscovered and the civilisation des-troy ed, but not before the interplanetary intelligence had intervened and\nremoved the while magicians in Hying\nsaucers to Mars. Man then formed his\npresent civilisation.\nThe Earth, however, has suffered\nfor long enough now and is beginning\nto get the energy she is entitled to.\nThis will result eventually in 100\nper cent bombardment of the earth\nby ultra-violet and cosmic rays.\nThose among us who are sufficiently\nadvanced to progress into the great\nmillennium will be hardened to endure this, the rest will be removed to\na distant part of the Galaxy to start\nlife again.

The game was now\nrunning very much I.C.'s way when\nafter a splendid movement across the\nbacks the pass to Ridley, who looked\ncertain to score as all he had to do was\neaten the ball and fall down, was intercepted by the opposing winger who\nran the length of the field to score\nunder the posts. The try was converted and while I.C. were rv c king on\ntheir heels, the Club added another 5\npoints through a try from a tap\npenalty. The college came back and\nRiley scored what was probably the\nbest try of the match after good handling by his backs. The conversion\nflailed and shortly before the enol\nBlackheath scored another good try\nto end a game which was enjoyed by\nboth pl avers and spectators.\nAN ASTRONOMICAL score was amassed by the 1st XV against the\nMetropolitan Police \" G\" div.\u201463 points to 5. With the forwards combining together well and completely swamping the opposition, there was\nplenty of chance for the three-quarters at last to show their ability.

Several minutes\nlater Bentham after a long tricky run\nlost the ball 2 yards from the goal but\nin a goal mouth misunderstanding the\nKing's defenders put the ball in the\nnet.

She came to\nEngland after taking aB.A. in\nEnglish and Psychology, and\nwithin a week of her arrival here\nmet Dr. Butler.\nShe and Iter husband now live in\nSouthside, which she describes as \" a crazy piece of architecture,\" and are\nresponsible for the 72 students of\nKeogh Hall. She says modestly that\nit does not take up much time fulfilling these responsibilities.\nAsked about South Africa she re-plied, \u2022' I think I couldn't live there\nnow because I feel so strongly that the\nnegroes there are getting a very rough\ndeal.\"\nShe was emphatic in stating her belief that it is the duty of the white\nman to educate the net jr o, and admits\nthat, at the present time, it would be\na bad thing to let the uneducated negroes of South Africa have the vote.\nThe Ih.'nk s Great Britain should make\nRhodesia acc spt the constitution, yet\nundertake to finance a huge attack\non poor education.\nOn the subject of Felix.Mrs. Butler's first comment was that, two years ago,\nwhen she came to Imperial, \" Felix\nseemed to reflect a feeling among\nstudents that they were somehow being\npersecuted. \" She feels that Felix\nhas an important role in helping the\nUnion to influence the people who\nguide Imperial College.\nShe thinks we are fortunate in\nstudying at a college with such a high\nacademic standard, but considers it a terrible waste for students to spend\nall their time working for a good\nDegree.\nRegarding noise in Southside, she\nfeels very much on the side of the\nstudents. In fact Mrs. Butler is on the side of students in all things.\nShe is a very warm person, and is\nideally suited to her position of war-den's wife.\nPETE WALL U MI.C. FOR EXPORT\n^ EMBERS OF the College will, no doubt, be pleased to know\nthat the College is featured on one of a series of posters, for\nrelease abroad, showing life in Britain.\nThe series, published by HMSO and\nprepared by the Central Office of Information, has been distributed by the\nInformation Offices of the Diplomatic\nservice throughout the world.\nLondon Airport, Buckingham Palace,\nWestminster, New Scotland Yard are\namong the many other aspects of life\nshown, together with scenes (on the\n\" I.C. poster\") in physics, geology,\naeronautics and other departments,\nhalls of residence and the Field\nStation at Virginia Water. Central\nOffice claim that the poster is not to\nencourage students to come to IC( or\neven Britain) to study, but merely to\ninform, (the posters being displayed\nin Universities, schools, libraries etc),\nas were the similar posters already\nissued on Sierra Leone and the achi ev ment of independence in Zambia.\nThe posters are available in the UK at Is. 6d. plus 6d. postage from the\nCentral Office of information or\nHM SO.

T.B. Browne, now lives in South Kensington, and is an Honorary Vice-President\nof the C.&G. Motor Club.\nThe big event of the year for Bo is\nthe RAC London-Brighton Run, which takes place on 7th November.\nGuildsmen always give Bo a good send\noff from Hyde Park and after the\nrun, there is the Motor Club luncheon\nin Brighton.\nBo takes the President of Guilds to\nPutney on Morphy day, and usually\nattends the Lord Mayor's Show, last\nyear also competing in the V. C.C. Rallies in Kensington Gardens and at\nCrystal Palace, and did quite well in the driving tests.\nThe college bought Bo from a Shropshire blacksmith around 1930\nto replace a1905 Rover, which was\nfound to be too young for the Brighton\nRun. It is reputed that Bo lapped\nthe Brooklands circuit at 29 m.p.h. in1929.

It should be a real\ngas; there will be new bands as well\nas old, the Jazz Congress being there\nto provide the audience with some\nrocking modern jazz).\nThe format of an intimate, candle\nlit atmosphere and a bar, found so\nsuccessful in previous years, will be\nused again this year. Admission fees\nare the same as last year, Is. 6d. for\nmembers and 2s.6d. for non-members.\nFinally, don't worry about the number of girls there\u2014those jazz club\ncats have been working like crazy\ndistributing posters for the past week\nand a half.\nHORN BLOWER Birds nest NIGHT\nPROWL\nDO YOU KNOW that most of\nthe Oxford Street shops and\nstores have a late night every\nThursday ?

We have decided to experiment by having a Rag Week this\nyear as it was found that only\n\u00a3170 (apart from the procession)\nwas collected outside I.C. last\nyear.\nWe believe that Rag Week will\nraise a far greater amount, and will\nalso relieve some of the pressure on\nthe Carnival organisers and helpers\n(luring Carnival week as we shall not\npj collecting outside college during\nCarnival week.\nWhat events will be taking place\nduring Rag Week?\nRag Week will mainly consist of\ncollections outside LC, as too many\norganised events in College would, in part, defeat its purpose. There will\nbe, however, two hops, one on the\nfirst day of Rag Week, 6th Nov., and\nthe other on 13th Nov.\nStunts organised by the Carnival\nCommandos will fill most of the\nweek's timetable: two of the ideas\nalready suggested are\u2014putting a large\nbanner round the G.P.O. tower and\nthe invasion of the stage of a West\nEnd Theatre by students carrying ban-ner s. Is help needed by yo.:r Committee\nto run any of the event:, in Rag Week\nand if so, who should st_ J ents wishing\nto assist contact ?\nWe do need a great deal of help.\nThis year's Carnival Committee is\ncomprised mainly of students new to\nthis type of work, and we still need a few more committee members. Also,\nassistance is needed to suggest ideas\nfor the stunts and to carry them out.\nIf anyone is interested they should\ncontact Roger Cook, Commando\nLeader, 17, Old Beit or Barry Boddy.\nBotany II.\nHow much money do you expect to\nraise, and what expenses will be in-cur red? The target for the Carnival is \u00a33000,\n\u00a3700 of which it is hoped will come\nfrom Rag Week. The expenses for\nRag Week will be very small indeed,\nanother good argument for its addition to I.C.'s activities.\nDo you realise that at the I.C. Union Meeting you an tag on is ed the\nmajority of those present by your\ndestructive comments on the charities\nproposed?\nI did not realise at the time that I annoyed the people at the meeting,\nbut I do not think I made destructive\ncomments about the charities. All I expressed was the view of the Carnival Committee, but now that a charity\nhas been chosen the Committee will,\nnevertheless, be putting in a tremendous amount of work to ensure that\nthe Carnival will be at least as great\na success as last year's. When I said that part of the ComThe Carnival Chairman, right,\nanswering questions last Wednesday night.\nmitte e would resign if F. P.I.C. was\nchosen, I did mean only part of the\nCommittee. I do not wish the charity\nto suffer through my misunderstood\nstatements at the meeting.\nAACHEN THANKS\nY} EAR FELLOWS,\nAfter our splendid visit to London we all have reached Aachen\nagain in good health and still better\nmood, in remembrance to your so\nvery kind way of looking after us\nand what was good for us.\nAt this place we want to express\nonce again our feelings of great grace\nfor all of you, who had such an\nactive part in doing all things we enjoyed so much.\nThank you very, very much !\nERNST S1NGLEMAN\nNICK F.F.

A large majority of like items in the paper\nwere concerned with the \" Indian\naggression on Pakistan.\"\nPlaced at several other strategic\npoints in the lounge were Pakistan\nGovernment publications, such as\n\" India's War on Pakistan,\" etc. The\ncontent of these is not difficult to\nguess. Whatever one's views on the\npolitical situation in the Indian sub-continent, such action is to be de-plo red. The point is not that, to say\nthe least, these publications gave a very one-sided account of the situ a tion, but that the Union Lounge is\nnot the place for the dissemination of\npropaganda.\nTnose concerned are entirely at\nliberty to make their point of view\nknown by holding a public meeting.\nSince it is easy to guess who are the\nauthors of this action, it is hoped that\nUnion officials will take steps to prevent the recurrence of such happen-ing s.R.

Already the RCS Silwood Ball is under review because of\nits huge loss.\nNew hotels are continually springing up, and are eager to create an\nimage and traditions. On our own\ndoorstep there is the Royal Garden\nHotel j perhaps they would welcome\nour Commemoration Ball.\nOne way or another IC must ensure\nthat those faithful students who support these expensive functions will ob-i a ln value for money.\nCHEMISTRY\nDISAPPOINTS\nTN SOME RESPECTS the exhibition\n' in the Chemistry Department was\ndisappointing. However, the fact\nthat some attempt at an exhibition had\nbeen arranged made it better than\nmany Deraptmer.t;. The exhibition was divided into\nmany different sections in different\nparts of the building. In many of the\nsections however, all that could be\nseen was a massive electrical console\nwith a solitary person in charge to\nanswer questions.\nThere was an attractive disp ly illustrating radio-tracer technique in\nplant-life in the entrance hall. But\nfor sheer enthusiasm the section concerned with organic techniques was\nunsurpassed, the demonstrators almost rivalling with each other to display their work.\nOne member of staff observed that\nthe exhibit ipn would probably attract\nmore people if held in the morning\nrather than the evening and indeed,\nthere did not seem to be many people\nthere.\nH ARLINGTON BEER THE ATHLETICS GROUNDS Committee is to investigate the\nsources of supply and conditions of\nstorage to improve the quality of the\nbeer at Harlington.\n\" South Africa is run with white\nknow-how and black labour.

The\nformer had apparently been in preparation for some three weeks before-hand, though, as with Zoology, had\nactually been set up only that morn-ing.\nAltogether Botany had 57 exhibits\nin sixteen rooms. One of the most\npopular of these was the genetics, as\napplied particularly to humans (who\nsaid Botany was all plants ?) and\nespecially to those with abnormal\nchromosomes and rarely seen outside\nmental institutions. Its success could\nbe measured by the fact that the lecturer was unable to enter his own\nroom.\nApart from such general information as on the common diseases of\npotatoes and a display of fungi, there\nwere some meaty five-minute lec-ture tte s like the one on how plant\nchloroplasts make sugar and the ways\nin which this is verified ex peri men tally,\nImpressive new equipment and coloured lights added to the Earls Court\natm6 sphere. In contrast Zoology had\nbut one laboratory on show\u2014on the\nthird floor (no lift).\nTHE MATHS Exhibition was conspicuous by its absence.\nLORD FLOREY'S SPEECH\nAFTER AN AMUSING opening\n\u2022<*Lord Florey settled into a serious\nvein and talked about the problems\nfacing science and technology.\nThe growth of technology, he said,\nwas needed for the improvement of\nBritain, but less young people seemed\nwilling to take up science. As well as\nthis problem, Lord Florey stressed the\nnecessity of good management :\n\" social psychology \" being as important as many scientific discoveries.\nLord Florey ended by saying that\nalthough England could not compete\nin, say, the U.S. space programme, she\nshould develop a special field of work\nand lead the world in this.

Epsom's forwards were initially more workmanlike than those\nof I.C. but the defence held its own\npromisingly.\nAfter the interval the continued\npressure of the attack and the abrupt\nending of any Epsom onslaught soon\nresulted in I.C. gaining the psychological advantage and five minutes\nfrom time Hough clipped a pass from\nClark through the keeper's legs to\nclinch the defeat.\nWORKING HOLIDAYS\nTHE EXPLORATION Society is\nbranching out.

CHA 6081\nComment\nFalse Steps from the Chair\nJCS CARNIVAL took a backward step at the first IC Union Meeting of the term, on 21 Oct. For here, this year's Carnival Chairman, Chris Hocking, tried to blackmail the members oi the Union\ninto supporting his favoured charity.\nWhat this supposedly \" impartial\" gentleman did in effect was to say that if\nthe Meeting voted in support of either the Family Planning International\nCampaign or the Notting Hill Housing Trust, then they would have to\nfind a new committee to run the 1965/6 Carnival.\nThe Carnival Chairman is appointed\u2014by a Board of Student Officers upon the\nrecommendation of his outgoing predecessor\u2014as a policy maker on the\nway in which the Carnival is run. He has no say\u2014other than as an\nordinary member of the Union\u2014in determining which charity his committee should work for. But an official position is difficult\u2014if not\nimpossible\u2014to shed.\nHocking that Thursday abused his position. Asked to speak as Carnival\nChairman, instead of saying that it did not really matter which charity\nwas elected and appealing for helpers whichever won, he proceeded to\ndivulge his personal views.\nHocking poisoned more people against.the Carnival than he gained supporters.\nNot only was Hocking far from impartial, but he was also peculiarly ill informed. At the Union Meeting he stated that he could not recall an\nIC Charity Carnival that had raised less than \u00a32,000. Dr. iCe n Weale, the\nUnion's Honorary Treasurer, however, tells me that ONLY TWO have in\nfact topped \u00a32,000.\nRecent Carnivals have raised : \u2014\n1965 Notting Hill Housing Trust - \u00a32,417\n1964 National Mental Health Appeal - - - \u00a32,211\n1963 Freedom From Hunger Campaign - - - \u00a31.673\n1962 War On Want - \u00a31,126\n1961 Oxfam \u00a3877\n1960 World Refugee Year - \u00a3600\n1959 World University Service - - - - - \u00a3636\nFrom these figures it should follow that this College is capable of raising\n\u00a33,000 this year for charity (especially considering the recently increased\nundergraduate maintenance grants).\nOur unsuitable Carnival Chairman must be pushed\u2014not merely by student\nopinion, but also by their active participation. \u00a33,000 is not an .-'easy\ngoal\u2014but it is feasible. We did not expect to raise anything like \u00a32,000\nfor Notting Hill last year\u2014but we did. Apart from money, we can\nhelp the Trust by labour. And should all this lead to a successful\nCarnival, then the Union may feel justly proud.\nBut if this year's Carnival does not raise even \u00a32,000, the fault will lie squarely\non the shoulders of the Carnival Chairman\u2014not on those of the members\nof the Union who failed to give him the support he needs.\nChildish Sport and MorphyDay\nU OW CHILDISH it was of Guilds Union a fortnight ago to deb a gIC' \u2022'\u2022Deputy President Chris Molam, \" try\" him for desertion to Mines,\n\" hang \" him in Prince's Gardens, and attempt to \" bury him at sea \"\nin the Round Pond !\nHowever, behind: the irresponsible facade of constituent college union meetings\nthere lurks deadly earnest. This instance was unique in that it brought\nthe four unions together. Moreover, it gave the shy, retiring President of\nRCS, Mike Scott, the boost he so badly needed, by his appointment as\nadministrator of justice upon the accused.\nThe constituent college union officers persistently announce that their union\nis the greatest. But confidentially, they may tell you, there is one greater\n\u2014 IC Union. They believe that ICU can only be strong if C& GU,R CSU and R SMU are also strong. If all are weak\u2014which, thank goodness,\nthey are not \u2014 ICU too is weak. If only one is powerful, ICU does not\nexist.\nAnd so to Morphy Day\u2014today. Obviously, if two Unions are represented on\nPutney towpath in ludicrously small numbers, the whole fun of flour\nmissiles and mutual de bagging is lost, and these activities could well\nbackfire onto the innocent general public.\nAny incidents\u2014such as have occurred in the past\u2014like . . . two old ladies in a car terror is ed, another knocked down . . . a small boy's balloons deliberately burst . . . traffic delayed . . . cars turned round . . . firstly give\nthe College a bad name\u2014so spoiling your chances of obtaining a responsible career\u2014then in turn weaken IC Union and the constituent college\nunions.\nThe strength of IC Union lies in the competition between the constituent\ncollege unions, and its weakness in the ill-treatment of bystanders. So\nthis year exhaust yourself in first class\" sport\" at Putney, and travel from\nand to South Kensington peacefully and responsibly. You will get odd\nlooks\u2014but they will at least be ones of curiosity, not displeasure.\nANGRY ABOUT\nSOMETHING ?\nDONT WASTE all that beautiful\ninvective on the barmaid\u2014FELIX\nwelcome s letters on almost any topic.\nDrop them in our pigeonhole in the\nUnion Lower Lounge.\nHUXLEY THANKS\n\\ SHOULD LIKE to take the\nopportunity to thank, through\nyour columns, the members and\nsupporters of the T.H.

PILCHER,\nBALLOT DOUBTS\nAS REPORTED IN this issue of\n\u2022**-Felix, in the voting for the Carnival Charity the second preferences\nof t nose who voted for the Family\nPlanning International Campaign,\nwere used to decide between the\nother two charities, which tied for\nsecond place.\nI would suggest that this was a mis-interpretation of the wishes of the\nvoters. I myself, for example, put the\nF. P.l.C. as my first choice and, to\nguard against its coming third in the\nfirst ballot, Notting Hill as my second\nchoice. I definitely did not intend\nthis second vote to be used to decide\nbetween the two other charities. Had\nI known that this would be done in\nthe interests of my first choice, I would not have given a second one.\nSurely it would have been more\nreasonable to have used the second\npreferences of those who voted for\nN.H. H:T. and Cancer Research to\ndecide between them\u2014this at any\nrate would have been nearer to the\nideas of voters at the meeting.\nP.M. RU HEM ANN,\nChairman Comsoc.\nQUEUE BEATER?\nIN view of the long lunch-hour\nqueues, that have actually increased since I came last year, and th*\napparent shortage of Mooney's staff\nto deal with this situation, I draw tn j attention of Imperial College students\nand especially those queue-frustrated\nfresher s among them to a nearby refectory (self-service of course) at 15\nPrinces Gardens (only five minutes'\nwalk from the Union) where better\nmeals-, are served at equally cheap\nprices.\nGEORGE BARAMKI,\nPhysics II\n\n"

He attributed the wars and .misunderstandings\nof the latter centuries to man's in a bil ty to develop these four facets equally.\nDuring question time Mr. Schumacher was quick to point out that\nFreud's theories, based only on\nclinical observations of his fellow\nkind, were, in his opinion, rather\nlimited. He even suggested that in\nthe not too distant future students of\npsychology would not regard his contribution as very significant.\nFurthermore, Freud's concept of the\n\" Inner Mystique of Man\" was by\nno means original, in fact all the\nancient religions had accepted the\nexistence of an intangible part of a man's character in the old adage\n\" Know Thyself.\" Freudians take\nnote ! !\nTENORS WANTED By Chris Evans\npOLL OWING ITS HIGHLY successful tour, the Gilbert and\nSullivan Society's production of \" The Mikado \" returns to College for four nights on November 9th12 th.

The Mayor thanked\nus by letter, expressing the appreciation of many of the residents.\nIn spite of excellent accounts in the\nWest Country press, audiences were\npoor in Bristol, but the choice of\nvenue was open to criticism. Nevertheless, it was a highly enjoyable tour\nand we hope to visit Folkestone again\nnext summer.\nNew members, particularly basses\nand tenors, are always welcome,\nladies are usually in the majority.\nFuture plans after \" The Mikado\"\ninclude \" H.M.S.

With a grant and a steady girl, the prospect\nof a secure and highly remunerative career, and at least forty\nyears of active life ahead, who needs faith ?\nIn the next few weeks the Christian\nUnion as ms to shake any I.C. men who\nhave this cynically complacent out-look.\nSuperficially, there are two main\ninfluences causing people to believe:\nfirstly, the sheer weight of evidence,\nand secondly, the objective need to\nbelieve. This second influence is\nmore far-reaching than we often care\nto admit. How many ideas' do we\naccept practically because we need\nthem to trot out in the exams?\nReligious faith has one further requirement not covered by intellectual\nbelief. It requires total commitment\nand involvement. Christians maintain that God uses the intellectual factors to help people to put their faith\nin Christ.\nBut what was that about the Christian Union? Well, much time has been\nspent presenting the evidence for\nChristianity. It is time we confronted\nstudents at I.C. with their need for\nfaith in Christ. To this end, we are\nholding a series of lunchtime meet-in gs, entitled \" Why Believe?\" from\nNovember 15th to 19th to consider\nsuch problems as the purpose of life,\nthe need for security and the fear of\ndeath.\nIn the evenings, discussion groups\nwill be held for you to thrash out\nsep c if jc problems and air your objections.

In any case, since the\nmotion is being proposed by Dr Eustace Chesser, the level of debate\nis likely to be very high.\" Asked\nwhat his own views were on this\ntopic, the spokesman replied, \" I don't see why any woman should give birth\nto a child she doesn't want.\"\nReports that Mr. Mike Edwards,\nPresident of Debates is seeking spiritual guidance before chairing the\nmeeting on November 4th, are completely unfounded.\n\n"
