    "content": "LETTERS\nDear Colin Tony Cox' s letter must inevitably be answered, but it is\nwith a sigh that I do so, as I can do little more than reiterate\nmy reasons for proposing the\nbyelaw change which will dissolve I CW A if passed on the\nsecond hearing.\nIn direct reply to Tony, I would like to make two things\nclear about the lounge. Firstly,\nthe I CW A Lounge is reserved\nfor the use of women during\nevery weekday lunch t f me and\nis not available for normal union booking despite the fact\nthat the S CR often has to be\ndouble booked. Secondly, the\nI CW A Committee were the first to ask that the Crash Pad be moved out of the Lounge as\nit was inconvenient and thus it\nwas moved to the S CR. Also, Iam well aware that to\nreduce IC WA's grant does not\nrequire a bye-law change and I did say this at the U GM, making no further comment\nabout money. Iam sorry that\nTony has fallen into the trap of\nmany others and has been unable to separate me from the\nCC Us and could not resist an\nuncalled for dig at the CC UV Ps.A sTony says, representation\nshould be the most important\nfunction of I CW A. But the\nwomen in College are not reached by I CW A and nor are\nthey contributing their views to\nthe I CW A President. It is\ntherefore unrealistic to believe\nthat the I CW A President can\nrepresent the women in College.\nThe mere existence of a women's association does not\nmean the problems are solved\nand yet Iam often told \" women are OK, they've got I CW A,\" which is not the case.\nTony is looking at I CW A from\nthe outside, he is kindly saying,\nwhy not let the women have their\nlittle room and organise their\nlittle functions (I might add here\nthat I CW A have cut their social\nfunctions by half this year and\nsupport for those remaining is\nhard to come by). It would help if\nhe knew what I CW A did rather\nthan know what he thought\nI CW A did. He is talking about\nI CW A in theory not I CW A in\npra c it ce and his closing paragraph puts this in a nutshell: \"to\nsweep away an established traditional and dignified organ-is ation\" is all well and good but I would add \"that can no longer\ndefine its role, nor identify an\narea of College life in which\nfunction and, consequently, that\ndoes nothing\".\nI believe that the dissolution of\nI CW A will give women the\nchance to reestablish their status as individuals instead of\napathetically allowing them selves to be replaced by an\noutdated institution.\nJo Armitage\nDear Sir\nIn response to Tony Cox' s letter last week, I would like to\npoint out that it is hardly surprising that most of IC WA's supporters are men. It certainly\ndeserves no support from women, because every time one\nof the six active members of\nI CW A opens her mouth, she\ninsults most of the women in\nCollege. Most women are quite\nable to get on in an atmosphere\nwhere they are in a minority\n(indeed, a lot of women get on\nmuch better then they would in a more even one), and so they do\nnot like to hear I CW A telling\nthem that they can't. Those\nwomen who have gone a long\nway in College or the Union do\nnot like to hear I CW A ignoring\nthis fact and saying such things\nare impossible.\nAs for the I CW A Lounge \u2014\n.such a large room is entirely\nunnecessary for such a small\ngroup. They have never had\nmore than fifteen people at any of\ntheir meetings (and four of those\nonly went to hackle) except for\nthe meeting to discuss closing\nthem down. The room could be\nput to much better use by, say,\nDear Colin I would like to use FELIX to\ntell members of the C&G Union that they are the most\napathetic and ungrateful lot of\nstudents I 've had the misfortune\nto know. Next time you go to a Halloween party, Valentine's party, or just about anything\nthat's worth going to, spare a thought for the small group of\npeople who h ve given up their\ntime to organise it!\nWhat amI on about? Well,\n99% of you lazy lot wouldn't know, I refer to today'sU GM, which, in fact, wasn't. It was\ncancelled because only 20 or\nso students could be bothered\nto turn up, what happened to\nthe overseas students, whose\nclubs are supported by large\nnumbers of members. Tony Cox said that I CW A only use it when\nit is not being used for anything\nelse, but as they have first\nrefused on it, it cannot be used\nfor anything else when they are\nusing it. In fact, they are refusing\nto let anyone else use it. These\nsix women frequently infest the\nMaths Common Room and will\nprobably continue to do so when\nthe I CW A Lounge becomes the\nUpper Lounge.\nTo say that I CW A represents\nanyone, either on Council or\notherwise, is totally ridiculous.\nMer che Clarke represents only\nthe six active members of I CW A( she does not bother to find out\nthe views of the other 400 or so\nwomen). By contrast, Katy Tatchell represents 150 women\nand Kirsten Pratt represents 60.\nAlso, Council certainly has more\nthan 10% women \u2014 try counting\nthem sometime. There are more\nwomen involved in just about\nanything you can mention than\nthere are in I CW A. Why should\nyou assume that women need\nspecial representation anyway\nthe couple of hundred that\nwent to the various things organised by the Union, is\nwhat I want to know.\nThe meeting was to have\ndiscussed a constitutional change which will effect the\nway next year's responsible few\nwill be elected. Again few q f you will know what I'm talking\nabout, as so few of you came\nto the last U GM. In a vain\nattempt, therefore, I will try to\nexplain, in brief so as not to\ntake up to much of your valuable time, the two major\nchanges involved were:\n1. Exec posts will be voted for\nby secret ballot.\n2. Stand downs will be limited\n\u2014 that is as insulting as to\nassume that they are incapable\nof opening doors for themselves\nor standing up on buses. How about having someone on Council to represent men?\nThey say they do not want to\nbreak a59 year old tradition,\nbut there are a lot of other\ntraditions which they would not\nlike to see back \u2014 for instance,\nthe I CW A Lounge was founded\nat a time when women were not\nallowed in the Union Bar \u2014 do\nI CW A really want to go back to\nthose days?\nEvery hypocritical statement\nthat the six active members of\nI CW A make is almost totally\nfalse. To give a few examples:\n1. They say they will run\nseveral things, including play groups yet I CW A refused\nto have anything to do with\nthe crS che for the Chilean\nWomen's Conference which\nICCA G ended up running\ninstead. None of them have\never been to Holly Street\neither or Great Ormond Street Hospital (both ICCA G projects with children).\n2. They claim to believe in a \"woman's right to choose\",\nto the top three posts (president,\nvice president and honorary\nsecretary).\nI will not pass comment on the\nfirst part as this seems to be a generally accepted idea. As for\nthe second part, I will firstly agree\nwith what Jo has already said,\nthat is, that it is a compromise\nbetween those who want to keep\nstand downs, as they feel what\nfew interested people there are in\nthe Union will be lost from the\nExec if they are not allowed to\nrun for a second post, and those\nwho feel that if you think that\nyou're good enough for one post,\nthen you're not the best person\nfor another.\nThe real reason for trying to\nyet they deny any woman the\nright to choose whether to be\nin I CW A or not.\n3. Although they claim to\nstand for the interests of all\nwomen, they refused to have\nanything to do with the German measles publicity\ncampaign, (presumably because it concerned women\nwho did not want abortions).\nIn short, I CW A is a gross insult\nto all women, and detrimental to\ntheir integration into the College.\nAs men know very little about\nI CW A and it does not concern\nthem anyway, I appeal to them to\nabstain from vo tng \u2014 as Mer che and Co. are so against male\nsupport, they should not accept\nyour votes anyway. To paraphrase I CW A \u2014 a woman needs\nI CW A like a fish needs a bicycle.\nYours in disgust\nFiona Sinclair\nMaths 2\nPS: If they really want to belong\nto a club where women are in the\nmajority, I could suggest Ladies\nRugby, or even Op soc(65% female, as anyone who saw The\nSorcerer this week will have\nnoticed).\ndrop stand downs is an admin-is tr at ive one. However, by allowing limited stand downs\nthese problems can be overcome\nby spreading out the elections for\nthose posts. In my opinion the\nbest solution is to decide which if\nany, of the Exec posts require a person of similar character to do\nthem well. Stand downs could\nthen be limited to these posts\nonly.\nI do hope I 've insulted you all\nenough to raise some sort of\nreaction, even if it is a groan, and\nthat you will try and drag yourselves along to the next\nU GM. Be there or I 'll send the\nboys round. SM Cox Yours very annoyed CCD32 "

    "content": "TABLE TENNIS\nHOCKEY\nIC 3rds vs Thames Valley: 5\u20141\nLast Saturday, IC thirds (well, mostly\nthirds) played in the manner to which\nthey would like to be accustomed. Do I hear two-one? No they cry, five-one or\nTony Gre ig would have said:\" We made them grovel\". Moving as if the\noilfields of the Persian Gulf were at\ntheir mercy, the well-oiled forward Ifne\ndrilled a gaping hole in the Thames\nValley to begin a veritable deluge that\nsaw their opponents' hopes go down\nthe drain. After two minutes, Steve\nWriggley riddled his way through the\ndefence to score. Minutes later, Jim\nEbner found himself twenty-five yards\nout with only the goalkeeper to beat\nand, in a moment of extreme rashness,\nscored, and put himself on the road to\na jug. However, Thames Valley dampened IC's now soaring spirits by\nscoring. Recognising this blatant\nexample of ungentlemanly conduct (in\nview of the fact that the thirds had just\ngot used to playing on a pitch with\ngrass and proper markings instead of\ncontour lines, ie the match was at\nHari in gt on), Steve Ridley again shattered the opposing defence to\nleave the goalkeeper wishing, in vain,\nthat he was Dave Moynham.\nFor the second half, IC swopped the\nadvantage of Neil Mason's umpiring\nfor his greater skill in persuading our\nopponent's key man to try his hand at\numpiring. Incidentally, Robyn Morgan\nhereby apologise s for the appalling\nlow quality of IC's fourth goal which\nwas an inexcusable example of\nopportunism and would not have an\nallowed to mar an otherwise un blemished performance had it not improved\nthe goal difference. Chris Bird attempted to improve upon Kentucky\nFried Chicken by making the Chip of\nthe Year; unfortunately, he was outside the ' O' at the time and so only\nthe vision of what may have been\nremains. Gordon wy lie staked his\nc liam for a place in the team with a well timed run lead in t to IC's fifth\ngoal.\nAltogether, this was a performance\nof such polish, one regrets to have put\nit down to wearing clean, dry, cotton\nshirts instead of th soe nasty, damp\nnylon ones.\nIC FOOTBALL: HARD LUCK LADS\nI would like to thank all those who played for the\nseconds last Saturday in the semi-final. Unfortunately\nit just wasn't our day. Special thanks is due to the\nvociferous support given by a small band of hardy\nsupporters, who even with a defeat turned the whole\nday into a memorable occasion. May I also take this\nopportunity to wish the fourths the best of luck for\nthe replay against K CH2( if the game was played\nWednesday I hope they won).\nCheers, Phil.\nPARACHUTING COURSE If you ever wanted to hurl yourself out of an\naeroplane at 2,500ft, now is your chance. There will\nbe a talk and film on Tuesday 26th February at\n6:00pm in EE403 a, explaining what it's all about. All\nwelcome!\nIC WATER\nPOLO CLUB\nOn Thursday 7th February, IC firsts\nhad their first match for the UL U league, first division. They played against St Mary's Hospital at the UL U swimming pool in Malet Street.\nMary's started the game with a lot of\nenthusiasm and managed to score a goal in the first minute. However, the\ngoal shouldn't have counted, be,cause the scorer pushed the ball-under the water before he shot. IC\ncame back quickly and Barry Ashwin,\nplaying aggressively in the front,\nequalise d before the end of the\nquarter, after taking the ball from Phil\nMills.\nIn the second and third quarters IC\ndominated the game, scoring one goal\nin each quarter. Pat Porter and Nick\nLast were playing creatively mid pool and our attack was working efficiently.\nBarry passed the ball to Phil Thwaites\nand he swam up and scored our\nsecond goal with a lob over the goal\nkeeper's head. Phil Mills scored our\nthird goal with a long shot from a very\ndifficult angle. The ball hit the near\npost and went into the opposite corner.\nIn the -fourth quarter Mary's put all\ntheir effort to equalise, but our goalie.\nDave Roberts didn't give them a chance. He made three magnificent\nsaves, two of them from shots from\nthe two yards line! Just before the end\nof the game Nick Buckland attempted\na hard shot and their goalie saved it,\nbut the ball went in front of Phil\nThwaites, who literally swam into the\ngoal with it, to make the final score 4-1 to IC. It was a clear win for us and\nwe fully deserved it.\nTeam: Dave Roberts, Nick Buckland,\nPhil Mills, Pat Porter, Nick Last, Barry\nAshwin, Phil Thwaites.\nDimitri\nTOUR MATCH EXCLUSIVE:\nIC Ladies Rugby vs Magor\nMaidens: 4\u20144\nThis was the Welsh team's second\nmatch of the weekend and proved to\nbe a hard but friendly occasion and\nprovided us with the best ladies rugby\nwe have yet seen. IC went soon down\nto fourteen players when 'Stinker'\nWilton had to leave the pitch due to\nillness. Cornetto( Silvan a) soon followed her off with a limp wrist but\nwas re vitali sed enough to return after\nten minutes.\nIn the scrum s 'Happy Hooker' Babs\nwas magnificent, taking about eighty\npercent of the opposition ball although\nthey were sometimes driven off it by a well drilled Magor pack. In the backs\nMagor showed superior organisation\nand, with some excellent kicking from\nthe fly half, put IC under some pressure. This led to a try for them\nThe results of the first team over the\npast three weeks have been crucial\nand successful,( thank God, Allah, Mao, Buddha). First they defeated the\nseconds by the narrow margin of five\nsets to four, then Gainsford 8-1, and\nfinally the only remaining threat to\ntheir division four championship hopes, IN CO by nine sets to nil!\nThis means that they have an almost\ninsurmountable lead, and the cup should be ours! (The first trophy for\nIC in recent years.)\nThe seconds( see above) also defeated Sarah Siddons 7-2 to stay\ncomfortably in the middle of the table.\nOf the lower teams, the thirds continued their relentless pursuit of\nthe division 6b title, with 6-3, and 9-0\nvictories (who cares who they played?).\n(It was Sainsbury s3 and Imperial\nTobacco1 actually.)\nThe fourths (my shambles) managed\na poor disp ly to defeat Imperial Tobacco2 only72, but by also defeating the second place team. Fulham by 6-3, still have an outside\nchance of the division 6a title (as long\nas I stay out of the team).\nSpecial praise to Pete, Hong and\nKartik, of the firsts . . . just keep it up\nfor another match!\nAnd finally a mention of a friendly\nmatch against Downing College \u2014\nCambridge Unn. Their full strength\nside was defeated ignominiously by a mixture of IC 2, 3 and reserves \u2014\nwhat rubbish there is in these provincial\npoly s! Yours with the ru skies boycott the\nWorld TT championships,\nPetrov Hewkinovitch.\nPS: Lars Josefsson would be interested\nto know if anyone has a spare Kjell\nJohansson smash, as his is faulty; Kit\nNair thinks he's getting worse (even\nthough now we have to try when we\nbeat him!). Oh, and Stean is having a little ball trouble.\nafter fifteen minutes. However, after\ntwenty-one minutes IC's good ruc king five yards from the Magor try line led\nto a score when 'Animal' Harrington\ncrashed over the line.\nIn general the match was hard but\nfait, with good tackling and good running from both sides. Special mention must go, however, to Fay\n('Hotlips') who was outstanding as\nscum half. The final whistle went with\nIC putting Magor under considerable\npressure. We then adjourned to the\nbar where Mag or Maidens demonstrated their expertise at singing, drinking, and playing silly games, as\nthey had on Saturday Night.\nQuote of the dav from Thunder thighs\" S nook, to CBS newsman:\" Why shouldn't women use their bodies in every way they can to enjoy\nthemselves.\"\nS JG11 "

    "content": "BC G( tuberculosis vaccination)\nNearly two thousand people die of\ntuberculosis every in year in Great\nBritain, but fortunately this serious\ndeath rate is being steadily reduced\nby vaccination against tuberculosis\nwith BC G. Tuberculosis is caused by a living\ngerm in the cough and spit of\ntuberculosis patients. Many of us, by\nthe time we are adults, have developed\na natural protection against this germ.\nThe defence mechanisms in our bodies are powerful enough to kill off\nany invaders and we come to no\nharm. If we are one of these people\nwe have no need of BC G vaccination.\nNature has done the job already.\nOthers, for one reason or another,\ndo not get this protection naturally;\nand it is for these people that BC G is\nintended. Vaccination will give them\nartificial protection.\nHow are we to find those who are\nalready 'self-protected' and those who\nare not?\nBy means of a tuber cul in test \u2014 a tiny drop of tuber cul in injected into\nthe skin. This is quite painless. If the\nskin becomes red within the space of\ntwo to seven days( a positive\nreaction), it means that a natural\nresistance has developed, and no BC G vaccination is needed.\nIf nothing happens after the test (a negative reaction), then BC G vaccination is given to provide the margin\nof safety needed.\nFor those who are negative to the\ntuber cul in test, BC G vaccination is of\nthe utmost importance. The vaccination is nothing to worry about. The vaccine is injected into the skin, and in about three weeks a small red spot\nappears. This may ooze a little, but it\nheals quite normally, leaving a vaccination mark. The spot is not\npainful unless accidently knocked. Once vaccinated a person is protected\nagainst later infection with tubers u los is. Vaccination does not guarantee he will never develop the disease,\nbut the chances of this occur ing are\nvery slight.\nA team will be coming to the College\non Tuesday 26th February and again\non Tuesday 4th March. Sessions will\ncommence at 12:30 in Committee\nRoom329, Sherfield and end around\n2:30pm.. It is available to all staff and students\nwho have not been vaccinated previously or who are doubtful about\nprevious vaccination and who wish to\nhave a test.\nConsent cards must be completed\nbefore the session and can be collected from the College health service. Both sessions must be attended.\nPatricia Kilshaw,\nPrincipal Nursing Officer\nRAG MAG WEEKEND On the first weekend in March, Imperial College Rag are organising a Rag\nRace, the object of which is to sell about\n4,000 Rag Mags. The idea is very simple:\nwhen the bell in the Union Bar rings to\ncall time at 2:00 on Friday 29th February\ncompetitors leave College and travel by\nany means at their disposal to a university, polytechnic or college in the\ncountry, or indeed, the world, armed only\nwith a Rag Can and several Rag Mags.\nThese Rag Mags are sold for a mere 25p and the competitor must return to the\nUnion Ba r before the bell rings for time\non Sunday 2 nd March at 10:30pm. Now to make it interesting there are\nfour exciting ish prizes:\n1. The competitor who sells the most Rag\nMags within the specified time gets\nhis/her fare refunded or a cash prize (the\nvalue of which is to be decided) whichever is maximum. This is so that\nyou are not penal is ed if you sell Rag Mags at Queen Elizabeth College and walked\nthere, claiming no fare.\n2. A prize for the method of travel which,\nin the opinion of the judges was the most\noriginal, inspired, and/or silly.\n3. A prize for the furthest point from\nImperial College visited. Obviously adequate proof must be supplied.\n4. A prize for the highest number of Rag\nMags sold per hour. This is for the people\nwho can get rid of a hundred in ten\nminutes and introduces a new concept of\na race into the competition.\nTo qualify for any of these prizes the\ncompetitor must sell at least one hundred\nRag Mags during the race.\nIf anyone wins more than one prize (by\nroller-skating to Trinidad and selling 1,000\nRag Mags and is back in the Ba r before\n5 : 3 0 pm Friday evening) will not be allowed to accept more than one of them.\nWell, that just about sums it up. Now it's your turn to spread Superag across\nthe World.

The competition shall be open to all\nmembers of ICU:2. Competitors may enter in teams of not\nmore than four members.\n3. Competitors may leave from Bot/ Zoo Common Room any time after 2:00pm on Friday 29th February and must return to\nthe Union Bar by 10:30pm on Sunday 2nd March( ie before the bar closes).\n4.

Interpretation of these rules shall be at *\nthe discretion of the judges, whose decision in all cases shall be final.\nARE YOU LUCKY! Take two typewriters, a couple of\ntables and a smallish room; add one\nharassed editor and a handful of enthusiasts and that, in a nutshell, is\nLondon Student. No printing presses, no computerised typesetter, no darkroom, no camera, no plate maker, which by the\nway of a stark contrast, are all integral\nparts of FELIX. Looking at this in context\nreveals a startling imbalance; FELIX, although it has a relatively large print-run\nof around four thousand copies per week,\nis distributed only around IC.On the\nother hand, London Student at 20,000\ncopies per week (and a standard eight\npage issue \u2014 effectively the same as\nFELIX) is delivered to almost every college in London with a population greater than 250. As well as the problems\ninherent in that, London Student has to\npay its own way; it is required to be\nentirely self-supporting, using the revenue\nderived from advertising to also keep a house-trained sabbatical editor.\nIf you keep an eye on the grimy portals\nof the FELIX Office, you will see a couple\nof weighty bundles of London Student\ndumped there every Tuesday evening \u2014\ntheir working week starts the same day.\nBy comparison, FELIX starts its working\nweek on the Monday, but after our finished product has appeared on Thursday night, they are still forging ahead, working all day on Sunday and finally finishing on Monday. One of their\nbiggest problems is keeping people interested in working on their paper, because their activities are so remote\nfrom the average student and can appear\nso lacklustre. By way of a solution to this\nand financial difficulties, the new editor\nmade a fresh start by changing the name\nof the old Sennet to London Student, but\nshe still has the same problem in recruiting. FELIX succeeds here because\nit gets a substantial grant and is produced\ncompletely on Union premises; all it\nneeds is a little stamina on Thursday\nnights to make it a social and immediate\nevent. For London Student, folding, collating and delivery is all carried out by\ntheir printers.\nWhere London Student can be very\nuseful is in giving pointers for FELIX; take\na good look at the format and contents.\nLondon Student has a good two pages of\nnews and as well as regular articles on films, sport, etc, features some well-written reviews of the theatre, places to\neat out, and so on: It shows up some of\nthe gaps and undeveloped potential in\nFELIX, but look on the bright side; at\nleast we have that potential.\nLars Wernberg-Meller\n9\n\n"

    "content": "\" The time is 1:15, time for IC Newsreel.\" \u2014 spoken by Andy Finney,\nthese were the opening words of the first\nSTOIC transmission. It was17 th February 1970, and was a pilot for a potential series of news programmes. In\nfact there were only two more programmes\nproduced by STOIC during 1970, one\nwas a second IC Newsreel, and the other\nwas a programme called Pirates On The\nMedium Waves. The latter was an interview with Mike Raven a former pirate\nradio DJ, and at the time a Radio One presenter. Pirates On The Medium\nWanes was recorded in March1979 \u2014\nSTOIC were not to produce another\nprogramme for nearly eighteen months,\nan article in FELIX on 13th March1970 explained the silence by STOIC: \"Apparently the reason for the sudden\ntermination of the J CR news programme\nlast year was that it was judged that\n. carrying a monitor and recorder (video\ntape) around might not do them any\ngood. It is hoped, however, that next\nyear this service will be resumed with the\naid of a cable from the studio to the J CR, obviating the need to transport the\nrecorder.\"\nDuring the eighteen months silence,\nSTOIC were persuading the Union to spend\nthe money, required to link a monitor, to\nbe installed in the J CR, to the TV Studio.\nIn October the same year, the new chairman of STOIC, Tim Dye, was able\nto an ounce the imminent installation of\nthe link. On4 th November1971 Topic, a fortnightly news magazine, took to the\nair, with a live thirty minute edition. Not a bad attempt, considering STOIC had been \"off the air\" for eighteen months!\nBecause of technical drawbacks, and the\nfact that the programme was transmitted\nlive, there are no videotape archive recordings of any Topic programmes from 1971 to 1975. A point that STOIC have recently corrected by archiving every news programme now made, enabling the history of the college and\nstudents involvement in the union to be\nrecorded for posterity. For example, do\nyou know who stood for Union elections\nin 1975? Do you know what they said?\nSTOIC have the archive recordings of the\n1975 hustings and election meetings in the\nGreat Hall. Such is the extent of the\nSTOIC archives that it is currently being\ntransferred to a computer file system.\nVery little happened to STOIC between\n1970 and 1974 \u2014 the Union Building was\nconnected to the TV system, along with\nthe Southside TV Lounge and halls,\nJames Burke appeared on the programme\n\u2014 but there was nothing outstanding \u2014\nuntil 1974. Mark Caldwell became chairman\nof STOIC in 1974 and during his 'stay'\nproduced programmes with: Mel Brookes, Barry Humphries, Christopher Lee, Dirk\nBogarde, Tim Curry and Glenda Jackson, and many, many more. The series Film Talk\nwas created, and is still produced occasionally. The series has included interviews with many top film stars, along\nwith extracts from their current releases.\nAcceptance of the series by the ILEA TV service for broadcast over the London cable system, gave STOIC the biggest\ncoverage any student TV service has ever\nhad. It also enabled STOIC to have use\nof a broadcast quality TV studio and\nbackup facilities free of charge.\nLetraset a hidden expense !\n\n"

    "content": "AN OPEN LETTER TO DR RC SCH ROTER( Chairman of the Refectory Committee)\nIn a letter to the President of the Union,\nChris Fox, you wrote: \"We are going to look\nvery seriously at the general catering policy in\nthe College\". Your good intentions are very\n'welcome, but not enough. An investigation into\nthe catering policy is needed so that substantial\nchanges and economies can be made. We\nrealise that such an investigation takes time,\nand we have been willing to give you time. We\ndid not openly criticise the price increase of\n7.5% which came into effect on 1st January and\nthe regulator increase of 1% per month. We\nkept quiet because we knew that demand\nwould have fallen and so you would have had\nless scope and time to implement changes.\nHowever, now we find:\n1. Still nothing has been done about producing\n'comprehensive breakdowns on the nature of\nour business' from the computerised till\nmachines. These were introduced in the middle\nof last term and instantly provided the means\nto enable a breakdown of sales. Misinformation\nhas not been utilised. We conclude that no one\nwas sure what was wanted from the printouts\nor what was involved in the collating of the\nstatistics. A golden o port unity to provide a basis for better service is not being seized\nupon.\n2. Recent recommendations by the Refectory\nComplaints and Suggestions Committee have\nnot been implemented (eg: there are still no\nclear price lists or menus in Southside).\n3. The time scale you proposed for implementing\nchanges which we understood as being one\nmonth (from mid-January) has been extended to\nthree months.\n4. You are claiming, because the volume of sales\nhas gone up, that the service is adequate. You do\nnot take into account our 'cooperative silence'.\nAt a recent meeting of Union Refectory\nrepresentatives, we undertook to carry out a day-long survey of the J CR outlet. This complemented the proposal made at a recent Refectory i Committee meeting to \"keep a finger on the\npulse of demand\". The aim was to try to\nprovide a factual foundation on which proposals for specific improvements could be\nmade. (This in turn would highlight any existing\ninefficiency.)\nWe conducted the survey on Tuesday 12th February, when the following numbers of\ncustomers used the buttery.\nPeriod Hours No of customers\nMorning 10:31 \u2014 11:30 184\nLunchtime 12:06 \u2014 14:00 546\nAfternoon 15:00 - 16:30 160\nThere was no adequate price list or display\nof opening times. The closing time at 11:30am went against an agreement made with the\nRefectory Manager at a previous meeting. The\ncustomer flow increases considerably at\n11:25am, so the closing is wrong on an\neconomic basis.\nIt has been suge s ted that the J CR buttery\nmight become a cold food outlet' only. One\nhundred and ninety-nine out of the 546\nlunchtime customers had hot food \u2014 a significant business is done in hot meals.\nDuring the survey period eighteen centrally\nprepared salads were sold. The low level of\nsalad sales does not justify the internal\naccounting difficulties caused by making salads\navailable in the J CR.( While on the salad issue\nwe noted that salad is available in all refectory\noutlets in a different form, is there not a best\nway to sell salad?). Many of the above poir.ts\napply to the sale of fish (eight portions sold on\nTuesday). There is no clearing area in the J CR as in all the other outlets. The range of drinks\nis adequate.\nHowever the major problem seemed to be\nthe use of the tills. We were astonished to see\nonly the one till operating at the busiest part of\nthe day (12:15pm \u2014 12:30pm), the second till\nwas used between 12:30pm and 1:10pm and\nagain between 1:38pm and 2:00pm when the\nmoney was counted. We want to see both tills\noperating between noon and 1:00pm. The J CR sells many confection ary items that\ncan be found in the Southside Shop. We have\nasked if the confection ary for both outlets is\nbought from the same place (ie the cheapest).\nUnfortunately not, was the reply, but we\nunderstand that changes are imminent.\nThis survey was conducted using limited\nresources and so gave a fairly narrow sampling. Yet four of us achieved in one day\nmore than has been achieved by your full-time\nstaff with the aid of computerised till machines\n(sic) in four months.\nIt is up to you to instigate action to resolve\nall the immediate problems and their\nunderlying causes.\nWe call for a meeting of the Refectory\nCommittee, at the earliest date.\nYours sincerely,\nChris Fox, Roger Stotesbury, Malcolm Brain,\nTansy Hepton, John Passmore, Liz Lindsay,\nJohn Anderson (ICU representatives on the\nrefectory committees) Mark Clegg (Secretary\nof the PWP).\nDear Colin If the best Gary Nicholls( FELIX last week) can do in front\nof his typewriter is to make snide\nremarks about a manina virtually impossible position whilst offering no constructive\nsuggestion for the solution of\nLd rd Annan' s dilemma other\nthan pure vandalism of the\nwholesale closure of the small\ncolleges which form an import ant part of the delightful diversity of our university, then\nhe should return to the poison\npen letters, which, one imagines\nform the major part of his stock-in-trade.\nIam sorry if that sentence was\noverlong, but this mindless fatu to us criticism of honourable\nand intelligent men performing\ndifficult jobs as well as they can\nbe done, annoys me.\nTom Owen Physics 1\nDear Colin\nI wish to make a few comments on John Passmore' s article last week on the autonomy of student unions. As I see\nit autonomous student unions\nwould be an attempt to have the\nadvantages of being an ordinary\ntrade union and also those of\nbeing a body whose members\nhad their subscriptions paid out\nof public funds. It is therefore\nnecessary to examine whether\nsuch a situation is possible and if\nnot which is preferable. The third\nalternative of students paying\ntheir own subscriptions seems to\nme to be a non-starter since we\nall know that the general apathy\nin this college would preclude the\nworking of such an idea. It is\ntherefore apparent that student\nunion finance must originate in\nsome manner from public funds.\nIt must be remembered, contrary to some people's imagining, that a student's union\nis different from a trade union, in\nthat the latter does not have to\nfinance and support the vast\nrange of cultural, athletic and\nsocial activities which a student\nunion does. I would therefore\nsuggest that student unions are a unique class of corporate body,\nand need to be considered as\nsuch. No corporate body, in a modern society, can be truly\nautonomous, divorced from the\nrest of society.\nThe question which should\nthen naturally arise is to which\ninstitution should a student\nunion be accountable: the\ncollege, local government,\ncentral government, etc.\nFinally, the college has a student union which is autonomous from the college is\nperfectly entitled to remove\nstudent union representatives\nfrom its college.\nYours sincerely\nFrank James Dear Colin\nI would like to clear up a couple of points about my motion on megalomania in the\nlast U GM. In the U GM report ( FELIX8 th Feb) it was stated: \"This was,\naccording to Mr Merry man, obviously a joke motion\". The relevant sentence from my speech was: \" On the face of it\nthis is all a joke, but there is a serious point that we are trying\nto make\". Although the report\ncontinues to state my point that\ncertain letters were futile, the\nimplication seems to be that the\nwhole thing was a joke, which is\nnot the case; the second half of\nmy speech being quite serious. I also said that I agreed with aid for\nthe Cambodians, which was part\nof the Cambodian Motion, it was\njust the inference that the Prime\nMinister was unaware of the\nsituation and the sending of the\nletter that I was considering to be\nridiculous.\nI would also like to reply to\nChris Fox' s comment that I inferred that he spent the whole\nof his time writing such letters. I am, in fact, quite certain that he\ndoesn't, but what Iam getting at\nis that some of the letters which\nare written are rather pointless.\nOn recollection, he may have got\nthis impression from the end of\nmy summing up speech:\".... get\nback to the job of looking after\nICU,\" and if that is the case then I admit that it may have been a small error on my part.\nIn aUG M there are typically\nbetween 300 and 400 people,\napproximately10% of the student population of this college. A lot don't come because they consider it to be a waste of time. I however do not\nnecessarily hold that view, but I had spoken to several people\nwho do and who also hold my\nopinion on the international issues. I was therefore putting an\nopinion which is held by what\nmay be a fair number of people\n\u2014 if not the \"silent majority\",\ncertainly silent and which I felt\ndeserved an airing. We are, after\nall, encouraged to come and/or\nput motions, to UG Ms in order\nto have our say on things which\nwe do and don't like.\nPhil Merry man PS: The Blue Peter Cambodian Appeal has now exceeded \u00a3 3 ' / 2\nmillion.\n4\n\n"

Along with a copy of the minutes of the last meeting came a notification that the next meeting, (scheduled\nfor Thursday 21 February) had been cancelled\n\"as there are no issues which require the\nimmediate attention of the Refectory Committee\". 1\nThe element of surprise was further increased\nwhen on reading through the minutes of the last\nmeeting the student delegates were amazed to\nfind the phrase \" . . . say in three months time\"\nc roping up with reference to the scrutiny of\nprocessed information from the new tills, and\npresumably discussion on altering the service the\noutlets offered.\nWhat is more, they found no reference to the\n\"one month\" all five of them thought they\nremembered being said by the Refectory\nCommittee Chairman, Dr RR Schroter.\nAt a meeting on Friday of all the student reps\nplus the Complaints Committee reps, Chris Fox\nreported that his conversation with Dr Schroter\nhad yielded no real information except that the\nturnover for the last few weeks had increased '\nrelative to last year, (even taking into account\nprice increases). One of the reasons he went on to\nsuggest might be responsible for this was the\n\"mature\" attitude the Union had taken, (ie, not\nbeing strop py). This attitude had been a deliberate policy from the beginning of the new\nsession which coincided with a new and more\nreasonable Chairman. The feeling of the' student\nreps was that their patience was being somewhat\ntried.\nThe reps, along with the P WP, are therefore\nattempting to prepare a full reply to the Refectory\nCommittee, in which they hope to put forward\nsome positive ideas, something so far missing\nfrom the Refectory Committee.\nWill you be one\nof the lucky\n1 in 10\nto receive an\nac como dati on questionnaire\nnext week?\ncheck your pigeon hole\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY STOIC\nTEN years old this week\nMagnus'Pike being interviewed on STOIC PRESIDENT\nMEETS\nHEATH\nChris Fox took a2,000 signature\npetition to the RT.H on Edward Heath,\nMBE, MP. The theme of the petition\nwas, 'Overseas students are of cultural\nand economic benefit to the United\nKingdom and we believe the current\ngovernment's proposals concerning\nthem are not only detrimental to the\npossible economic recovery of this\ncountry, but wrong.'\nMr Heath was impressed by the large\nnumber of signatures from college staff.\nEG M STATEMENT A signed petition was received\non Tuesday night calling for an\nExtraordinary General Meeting to\ndiscuss business left over from the\nlast U GM and a motion proposing\na referendum on NUS affiliation.\nThus, as Union Secretary, I was\ncompelled to organise a meeting\nwithin three College weeks. Due to\nthe con jested timetable of events,\nthe date chosen is Tuesday 26th February at 1:00pm in the Great\nHall. The required fourteen days\nnotice of UG Ms is not strictly\nadhered to. This I have considered\nnot necessary, as the meeting is\nreally a continuation of the adjourned\nprevious meeting.\nNOTICE\nPapers for the posts of the\nPresident, Secretary, Deputy President and FELIX Editor will go up\non the Union Noticeboard, Lower\nLounge, Union Building at 10:00am on Monday 18th February.

It is quite\nsimply a response to the situation we now\nfind ourselves in; an industrial nation with\nchronic over capacity, inefficiency and\nwaste in industry, and a falling share of\nworld markets; a world of increasing strife\nand unemployment, and an alienated,\nselfish and materialistic society. We also\nhave this problem with electronic technology which increases efficiency and\nunemployment at the same time.\nLike it or not, we are entering the post-industrial society. We must clamp down\non the waste and inefficiency of our\nconsumer society, at the same time\ndeveloping good community facilities. The\nincreasing lack of work creates tremendous\nopportunities for more time spent on\nleisure, education and community involvement. We must develop, a spirit of\ncooperation, as opposed to the current\nconfrontation, at the same time involving\nthe individual in the running of his life.\nAt last September's Liberal Assembly,\na motion on alternative growth was\ndebated.

    "content": "RCS The most exciting event last week was\nun doubt ably the RCS Rugby Sevens which took place on Sunday out at\nHarlington. With only ten teams in all it\nwas Life Sciences turn to be indifferent\nwhilst Physics made up for their poor\nshowing (ie no showing) in the Soccer Sixes by entering three teams, including\ntwo from Physics 2 (alright, so one was a very silly team, but it's being there and\njoining in that counts). #\nWell, the afternoon followed its natural\ncourse and Maths3 showed a marked\ntendency to destroy most teams and inevitably met the serious Physics 2 team\nin the final. In a hard fought, gripping, nail-biting, knife-edge match Maths 3 almost\nlost control in the first nano-second but\nquickly recovered their composure to win\nnarrowly by lots to nil. Still, that's the way\nit crumbles, cooky-wise and we certainly\nenjoyed ourselves and want to thank Rag\nfor organising the afternoon and everyone\nelse for providing opposition.\nTonight is the famous inter C CU Valentines Party and there will almost\ncertainly be no admission without a ticket. Drop into the R CSU today and\nbuy one for only 50p which includes free\nadmission to the RCS Valentines Rag\nStunt tomorrow. Be in the R CSU between 9:30 and 10:00 to collect a rag\ncan to rob from the Knightsbridge rick\nand give to deaf kiddies via your enthusiasm. Doubtless all the candidates\nfor the forthcoming RCS elections will be\nthere if they're worth their oats (or even\nyour vote) so why not come along to find\nout who will be running your union and\nspending your money next year.\nThe first of two Royal College of\nScience Association Sherry Parties is next\nTuesday 19th February. If you are a third\nyear physicist or mathematician come along to the Senior Common Room and\nhelp the RCS A reduce their ongoing sherry lake crisis. You may even find out\nall the perks associated with RCS A membership.\nTickets are now on sale for a formal\nfour course dinner on the last day of\nterm. This is the Jez Dinner and is being\nheld to commemorate the firing of J ez last term. Why rush off home on Friday\nwhen you can enjoy a dinner with more\ncourses than the Freshers' Dinners and\nmore wine than the Annual Dinner and\nmore fire engines than the Silwood Ball.\nThere is even a bar extension and disco\nafterwards. All this for only \u00a36, yes not\n\u00a310, not \u00a39, not even \u00a37 but \u00a36 to\nanyone, and obviously the perfect way to\nround off the second term.\nFinally, as everyone knows, Sunday evening is traditionally the RCS Night-InThe-Bar, so I 'll look forward to seeing you\nall there this Sunday.\nIC Rugby Club are holding a24 hr sponsored iron. Starting at 12:30pm Wednesday 20th February in the Union Concert Hall. We will iron anybody's clothes free of charge, just bring them\nalong to the Concert Hall. There will\nalso be a collection and delivery service\nfrom the halls and houses.\n\\ C \u00a5 4\nI CW A BAR NITE on Sunday 17th February\nfrom 8:00pm in the Union Bar\nBarrels after 10:30pm. MINES By the time you read this two coach loads of miners will be on their way\ndown to Cornwall to do battle with\nRedruth Polytechnic Mining Department (?)\nLast Friday saw the Chaps Club Indoor\nFete in Stan's Real Ale Bar. Everybody who\nwent along enjoyed themselves; if you didn't go then you missed a good night.\nOn Tuesday the R SMA Curry Supper\ntook place. It was both an informative\nand entertaining evening for those who\nwent.\nFuture events are:\nThis Tuesday,19 th February: General Committee Meeting. If you are\non this committee then turn up. Anyone else will be welcome.\nSaturday 1st March: Nottingham 6s and 7s Tournament. We are putting out\nthree sixes and four sevens. Supporters,\nas always, will be very welcome. If you\nwant a place on the coach please see\nDave Rhodes (rugby captain) or Steve\nHind e( soccer captain) as soon as\npossible.\nMonday3 rd March: Inter C CU Swimming Gala. If you can swim/drift\nthen you will be needed. Further details\nwill follow.\nWednesday 5th March: Mods and Rockers Barnight.

The Field\nCup. This event is one of the highlights of\nthe College year and the idea is . . .

The treasure consists of various\narticles such as split crotch panties, 30ft lengths of scaffolding and many other\ndeviant things. Points will be given for the\ntreasure as well. (Bribing the marshall s in\nthe pubs is forbidden, well, maybe a little\nbit.)\nSunday 24th... The Guilds Soccer Sixes.

    "content": "For Valentine's Day, what could be\nbetter than a romantic comedy?\n\"10\" (X, Dir. Blake Edwards)\nOne of the most unexpected\nsuccess stories of the past year has\nbeen this feature from the director of\nthe Pink Panther series. Starring\nDudley Moore, Julie Andrews and\nthe much heralded Bo Derek, it\nconcerns the comic misadventures of\ncomposer George Webber as he\nconfronts middle age.\nGeorge is successful, well-off and is\nhaving a steady relationship with\nSam, played by Julie Andrews. He\nfinds himself attracted more and\nmore to younger women, grading the\nobjects of his desire on a scale from\none to ten (hence the mysterious\ntitle).. His analyst treats this as an\nef fct of middle age, but when George\nsees a stunning young beauty called\nJenny (Bo Derek), he cannot resist\npursuing her. The fact that she is just\nsetting out on her honeymoon doesn't seem to bother him at all.\nDudley Moore is superb in the\nmain role; his face is his fortune and\nhis comic skills are indisputable. He\nutilise s his skills as a pianist as well,\nproving that diversity is an underrated\nvirtue nowadays and also providing a few musical interludes. This regulates\nthe pace of the film, which tries to\nmaintain a fairly mild comic flavour.\nThe other star of the film is\nun doubt ably newcomer Bo Derek.\nPresented intially as a glossy tooth-paste/bra advert type beauty, she\nturns out to be a modern, liberated\nwoman, which doesn't quite match\nup to George's sexual fantasies. As\nan actress Ms Derek may have\nlimited talents (although it's difficult\nto tell from the film alone), but she is\ndefinitely a most attractive woman. It\nis interesting to note though that she\nis given an intelligent, liberated role\nand not limited to a 'dumb blonde'\nimage. This could set a further trend\nin the ever diminishing area attributed\nto 'sex symbolism'.\nThe surprise casting of the film is\nJulie Andrews as Sam. The fact that\nshe is Mrs Blake Edwards may be no\nsurprise, but I do feel that the part\nwas not quite for her. Can you really\nimagine this ex-singing, flying nun\nmouthing words like \"whore\" and\n\"screw\"! I'd go back to doing what I was good at, if I were her.\nThis apart, I found 10 an amusing\nand interesting film; it's very funny at\ntimes and also more than a little\nsexy.\nMark Smith\nDud takes a dip\nDud gets what he deserves\nA LIFE\na new play by Hugh Leonard\nDalkey, a small town in County Dublin,\nprovides the setting for this light-hearted\ncomedy, which revolves around the lives\nof two couples: Desmond and Dorothy\nand Lar and Mib s( Mary). By moving\nback and forth in time it shows them as\nthey were in their early twenties, and the\npeople they now are forty years later.\nDesmond, who was* a boy beaten into\nlearning by his schoolmaster father, tries\nto educate Mary( who is more interested\nin going to the local 'hop') to make her\nmore like himself, but shows nothing but\ncontempt for Lar(a cheerful lay about who also bestows his affections on Mary)\nand Dorothy( one of Mary's friends). In\nfact, he hates the town, and clearly sees\nhimself fitted for higher things\nForty years later, Desmond( married to\nDorothy, and in a job as \"keeper of\nrecords\" in the local Civil Service) visits\nLar and Mary for the first time after a quarrel. He behaves with bluntness which\nupsets Lar and offends Mary, and he only\nretains their friendship when he tells Mary that he has only a few months to live.\nFrom a slow first act, the pace of the\nhumour steadily increases; Cyril Cusack' s performance as the irritable Donald Drum m is full of wit and feeling and\nMaureen To al( Mary) obviously enjoys\nher role( she seemed to be having difficulty in keeping a straight face).\nThe cast all make the most of the parts\nthey have to play \u2014 it was a pity that the\nstage lighting wasn't similarly spontaneous.\nA Life, which was first produced in\n\u2022October last year at the Abbey Theatre in\nDublin, is being staged at the Old Vic as\npart of London's A Sense Of Ireland\nFestival Of Irish Arts. It's present run\nends on 16th February, but it is possible\nthat it will be transferred to a West End Theatre.\nSimon Hodgson\n8\n\n"

    "content": "In connection with the ILEA a unique\nseries of programmes were produced. In\nMarch1978 STOIC transmitted a pilot news\nprogramme called London Lunchbreak,\nwhich was based on ICs programme\nLunch Break. The programme was shown on the ILE A's channel seven network and\nwas broadcast live. Never in the history\nof the network had a live prog a mme been\nbroadcast. All of its output was either\ntape or film. The thought of a live\nprogramme from one of its studios took\nthe ILEA TV service slightly aback. A live\nprogramme perhaps \u2014 but made by\nstudents? The programme was even able\nto boast the appearance of Barry Norman, who arrived only just in time. A series of six programmes were produced\nby STOIC for transmission on the ILEA network, which prior to its closure last\nyear linked over 1,000 schools and 95\ncolleges of higher education in London. In\nfact the biggest closed circuit cable network in Europe!\nThe current series of news programmes\nin Imperial College now go under the\nbanner of News Break and are broadcast\nevery Thursday at one o' clock and repeated at six o 'clock the same day.\nVariety is the spice of.\nThe last ten years of STOIC have been\ncondensed into a fifty minute programme\ncalled Happy Birthday To Us!. The programme is presented by David G hani and follows STOIC from its first programme\nin 1970, through its ups and downs to the\npresent day. Happy Birthday To Us will be\nshown on Tuesday 19th February at one\no 'clock with a repeat at six.\nInvolvement with STOIC has enabled\nmany students to enter the field of\nbroadcasting as a career. Mark Caldwell\nrecently worked on BBCTV' s Film '80 and\nis now with Barry Took on Points Of View.\nEx STOIC members are working for:\nThames, London Weekend, and Anglia TV, as well as several more in BBCTV and\nRadio.\nIf you have been interested by this article\non STOIC and you would like to take part in\nthe activities, then either come into the\nCollege TV Studio on Tuesdays or Thursdays at 1:00pm or Wednesday evenings from 4:30pm till late, when Neujs\nBreak is being recorded.\nWith the recent updating of the college\nTV Studio's equipment, STOIC is now\nable to show some of its prog am mes in\ncolour, although the first STOIC colour\nrecording was made in 1976 when Glenda Jackson was interviewed. Only last term\nwas this interview actually shown in\ncolour for the first time.\nThe complications involved in producing\na typical interview are huge. STOIC needs\nthe following personnel: two studio cameramen, one floor manager, one caption cameraman, one videotape suite\neditor, one sound man, one vision engineer,\none director/vision mixer and finally one\ninterviewer. A total of nine people to get the\ninterview on the air. When STOIC mounts\nits annual marathon of live coverage of the\nhustings and election meetings later this\nAnother satisfied couple\nmonth this figure will double. As last year,\nthe election programme will be produced in\ncooperation with IC Radio. STOIC will\nmount the programme, both in the studio\nand Great Hall and an IC Radio presenter\nwill join STOIC for the day to provide a summary every ten minutes, this being\ntaken by IC Radio live on air. The event\nseems trivial but technically it is the most\nambitious ever taken on by STOIC. Split\nsecond timing to enable IC Radio to take an\ninsert spot on queue is no mean feat!\nAll in all STOIC is trying to provide the\nmost complete TV service for IC students.\nWith the recent connection of Linstead Hall\nTV Lounge, STOIC's coverage is almost\ncomplete, only Garden and Weeks Halls\nremain.\n7\n\n"
