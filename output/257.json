It is\nset on 15th April, 2001, in a bomb-shelter an il spotlight:; the\nend of \"childhood innocence\"\nfor Madam and Sir, the twenty-odd year old brother and s sier who have been brought up there\nby \" Cook.\" Combining ele me. it,\nof tragedy, comedy and romance,\nthe play gives detailed studies of\nthe three characters. Lesley\nSlater as \" Madam\" was outstanding in a part ranging from\npetulant child to nearly a full seduction of her brother, played by\nJohn Go!der.\nJohn superbly played \" Sir\"\nand throughout 1 had the sense of\na rapidly developing character,\nfrom a sister-dominated juvenile\nwho wanted to be a good boy to\nthe climax where he has a love\nscene with Cook, played by Roger\nHaines.\nCook has some of the funniest\nlines, the best occur ing early on\nwhen she has found the two\n\" children \" \" playing \" and having said that their mo'.her and\nfather would have been horrified,\nis asked \" What are mothers and\nfathers?\" Cook's answer is\n\" What you'll be if you're not\ncareful.\" Beginning as a heroine,\nbringing up two children under\nimpossible conditions, Cook\nchanges into somewhat of the\n\" Brutal stepmother.\" imposing\nobedience by fear of being fed\nthrough the mincing machine to\nmake r is soles if Sir and Madam\nso much as try to open the door\nbehind the door.\nIt is as Cook is about to behead\nMadam with an exceedingly\nnasty-looking meat cleaver that\nSir \" makes love \" to her. The result is she dies of a broken heart,\nleaving the curtain to fall as brother and sister finally open the\ndoor and go out.\nThe Freshers' entry was N.F. Simpson's\" The Hole.\" This\nplay concerns the legion events to\nbe imagined from contemplating\na common or garden hole in the\nroad. Tim Foster as the vision-a rv. scorned by the others for\nfailing to share the common\nview was the outstanding\ncharacter, always managing to appear natural and belonging there\nduring his long silences\u2014a difficult task which no other entry on\nthe first two nights succeeded in\nwhen their scripts called for it.\nAt the time of writing the results are not known (see Late\nNews) but of the six plays so far\nperformed, 1 place IC first and\nthird.\nKEN SIMPSON\nKeith.

At least\nthree sketches were ruined in this\nway, mainly by three rows of un-rul v people at the front.\nA spontaneous Kangela in the\nmiddle of the second half brought\nan answering Boomalaka and\nfirst beer and then the glasses\nholding it were being thrown\naround the front few rows of the\nHall. Prompt action by members of RCS General Committee\nPravda' s View Mr. Oleg Oresto (London correspondent of Pravda) gave personal views on human rights in\nthe Soviet Union. He said that\nthe declaration, while being excel-lent, meant different things to\nn re vented the disturbance spreading and the concert was allowed\nto finish amid ever-mounting\n\" audience participation.\"\nRetaliation\nAt the end of the last sketch\nbuckets of so eg v brown paper\nwere thrown from the s tafe at the\naudience. What the organisers\nhad not expected was a barrage of\nbeer glasses and chairs being\nthrown back. Before members ot\nRCS General Committee could\nstop it at least three chairs, inThe next speaker was Mr.\nSidney Shipton (Secretary of the\nWorld Jewish Organization (Bri-tish Section)) who later commented on some things Mr.\nOrestor had said about Jews in\nRussia. The phrase \" the wandering Jews \" arose because Jews\nhad, in the past, been deprived of\nmany human rights. Mr. Shipnumerable beer glasses, a microphone and a mike stand had been\nbroken.\nTheft\nA final blow to RCS Ents, who\nmust be congratulated on producing what, for the most part, was\nan extremely good show, was the\nstealing of the whisky bottle\noffered as a prize for the best\nlimerick.\nThe sweet taste of .success went\nvery suddenly bitter for RCS Ents\nlast Thursday night.\nton said that the Universal Declaration was completely in accord with ancient Jewish teaching\nrather than more recent religions\nwhich appeared to Mr. Shipton\nto be insignificant. He went on to\nshow how many of the Ten Commandments could be considered\nas forerunners of the Declaration\nof Human Rights.\nArabs Mr. Iqbal, (Deputy High Commissioner for Pakistan) said that\nthe British had no right in the firs*\nplace to give Palestine away over\nthe heads of the Arabs. Mr.\nIqbal gave a long account of\nIslam, which he considered to be\na successor to Judaism and\nChristianity. The Koran, like the\nDeclaration of Human Rights,\nproclaims the brotherhood ot man\nand the unity of moral law.\nOn the subject of women, Mr.\nIqbal (who had previously referred to the Chairman, Mrs. Joan\nRuddock, as Mr. Chairman) said,\namong other things, that men\nwere naturally polygamous.\nThe UDHR, although representing possibly world con-census, falls very short of the\nconcept Vis expressed in Islam,\nwhich involves man in his spiritual as we li as material existence.\nIn Islam, all people really are\nequal before the law. He also\nsaid that the UDHR, although\ncorrectly concerned with demo-c racy, was wrong to try and dictate an electoral method.\nThe concept of the Welfare\nState (which is intrinsic in Article\nOn one's way to report a lecture about \" The Use and Abuse\nof Drugs \" one might reasonably\nanticipate fifty minutes of utter\nboredom punctuated by spasms of\nannoyance. That this did not\nhappen is to the credit of the\nspeakers at the week before last\nThursday's General Studies Lecture, the Rev. Kenneth Leech and\nBrenda Jordan are from a church\nin the city, and Miss Jordan, Rev.\nLeech's wife, is a psychologist.\nThey are both closely connected\nwith the problems of drugs and\ndni tr addiction.\nMiss Jordan so oke first, with\nthe aim of putting the use of\ndrugs \" into context.\" For in-stance, man v drugs open to abuse\nhave valuable medical uses. Numerioallv the biggest \" drug\nproblem \" in this country is the\nabuse of aspirins by older people.\nShe then spoke of the physiological\nand psychological effects of drugs,\nclassifying t nem into the categories oi amphetamines, can na* George Assimakis has announced the results of his Southside\nShop survey commissioned by\nMartin Lack. Last term he distributed 500 questionnaires\nthroughout Southside; 202 residents replied, in the main expressing dissatisfaction, even extreme\ndissatisfaction with the shop. 35\nper cent admitted to using it only\nrarely, and with International\nStores 400 yards away it seems\nsurprising the figure is not greater.\nDissatisfaction was positively\nexpressed with the variety of\ngoods available (80 per cent), the\nprice of these goods (75 per cent.)\nand the hours opening (70 per\ncent.). Ide*s for improving the\n22) was first applied in Islam 1400\nyears ago, he said.\nDoctr i ne\nProf. Manning (Emeritus Professor of International Relations\nat LSE) said first that he was not\nthere to propound Apartheid as\nsome people imagined but to talk\nabout Human Rights, although he\nwould have preferred to talk\nabout human happiness, in the\ncontext of apartheid.\nAll over the world UDHR was\nviolated. In Britain, it was estimated that 16 of the 30 articles\nwere infringed. In South Africa\nNegroes have rights that they\nhave not fully enjoyed.\nRights, he said, are not had as\na matter of right but as a matter\nof doctrine. There are four possible approaches to Human\nRights : Theological, Metaphysical, Sociological, and Ideological.\nThe Metaphysical approach was\nridiculous, the Sociological approach was undoubtedly best but\nthe Ideological approach was unfortunately most favoured at\npresent. The \" rights vocabulary \" which accompanied the ideological approach meant different\nthings to different peoples. Prof.\nManning said that all sociological\nsituations are different and to understand we must see the whole\nsituation, things did not simply\nhappen because of \" rights,\"\nwhich he demonstrated with\nSend small urine specimen and\n\u00a3 2 fee. or request free container\nand literature. Medically approved\nhospital-used method determines\npresence or absence of particular\nhormone. Result by return post or\ntelephone.\nbis, opiates, aud. others.\nRev. Leech then talked in more\ndetail about various drugs in\nwidespread misuse. Holding up a box ful of assorted amphetamines,\nhe pointed out the once-famous\nPurple Heart, and the popular\nBlack Bomber. He made several\ninteresting points about the use\nof drugs. Generally, he said,\namphetamines are working class,\nhash is middle class, and so on.\nLike clothes, some drugs are subject to fashion; what London\nsmokes today, Manchester will\nhave in three month's time. In the\nWest Country, some people still\ntake Purple Hearts. Heroin addiction seems to be related to a particular mental make-up. The\nuse of heroin is increasing he said,\nbut discounted the theory that\ncannabis users tend to \"graduate\"\nto heroin. He also spoke at some\nlength about the sources of drugs\nin this country, and the alarming\ntendencies that are appearing.\nvariety included fresh fruit and\ncheese to canned food and vegetables ; of the few items presently\nin stock sugar was deemed the\nmost regular purchase.\nA majority was in favour of\nmaking the shop union-run, a minority for leasing it out to a private concern. There were a large number of complaints about\nthe present management : \" un-co-operative,\" \" never open on\ntime,\" \" everything seems to be\non order but\u2014\", Assimakis adds\nhopefully : \" a young attractive\nshop assistant was thought by\nmost people to be the ideal person to handle the shop.\"\nexamples, saying that politics is\nthe art of the possible, not perfect,\nand that the notion of natural\nrights is vulnerable. The UDHR,\nhe said, was an unrealistic agreement between SOME of the members of the U.N., excluding South\nAfrica.\nThe problems of South Africa,\nlike all problems should be\nexamined specifically, he said,\nand saw no reason wh v South\nAfrica should bow to the \" ideological imperialism\" of other\ncountries. The white min nn tv in\nSouth Africa was alienated by the\n\"' rights vocabulary \" and would\nnot change its ways until the rest\nof the world approached them\nmore realistically.\ntrot. Manning's speech was in-ter ru pie a an umo er of times and\nwas followed by bitter comments\non the real situation in South\nAfrica by a coloured South African.\nHypo cri sy\nIn all this we can see that everywhere there is a vast spectrum of\nknowledge, application, and belief\nin human rights. Most individuals and nations are either ignorant\nof the UDHR or when they have\nknowledge fail to fully live up to\ntheir declared beliefs. It is only\nafter this hypocrisy has been destroyed and knowledge of the\nUDHR is more widespread that\nwe can hope to reap the rewards\nwhich should follow.\nPIERS CORBYN\nNAME\nADDRESS\nPlease forward free container\nand literature under plain cover.\nLANCO LABORATORIES, 4 St. Aldwyns Road.\nManchester 20.

Attempts by way of International\ncovenants are now being made to\nmake the declaration into an enforceable document so that what\nis at present a list of \" claims \"\nmay become legal rights.

The rights of women and\nminority groups were very well\ncared for.\nWhile admitting that there may\nbe some things wrong with the\nSoviet Union he said that their\nPress was more democratic than\nours which was controlled by a handful of press magnates.\nWandering\nJ ews SAME DAY PREGNANCY TEST\n\n"

(4)\nthe first two floors and most of\nthe open shelves are on level 3.\nThe reading room will be on level\n2. The College library will be on\n5 levels because while the number\nof books it has is less than half of\nthe Science Museum's collection\na larger proportion will be on\nopen access, with reading rooms\non each level. It will house books\nnow kept in the Haldane and\nLyon Playfair libraries.\nThe focal point of the College\nBlock itself will be the Great Hall,\nwhich will have a flat floor and a balcony. It has not yet been decided if this will be available for\ninformal dances, but as it is twice\nthe size of the Concert Hall it\nwould not be full too often.\nAbove the Hall, on level 5 will be\ntwo large lecture theatres for\nabout 150 people each. On level\n1 will be a large cafeteria for staff\nand students. Adjacent to it will\nbe aS. C.R. The bie<zest error in\nplanning is on level 2 which \\i divided between the staff and student common rooms with a buttery between them. The Staff\nCommon Room is divided into\nseveral small sections while.the\nStudents Common Room is just\none large room 70ft. by 120ft. or\nabout half the size of Beit Quad\n\u2014it has already been labelled \"For\nthe Use of the Faceless Ones.\"\nUnless informal dances or some\nsimilar events are held in there,\nthe air conditioning plant will become quite redundant. Above\nwill be the Registry on level 3,\nthe Finance office on level 4 and\nthe Rector's suite of offices on\nlevel 5.\nMaths to Move\nThe completion of the College\nblock will certainly bring a sigh of\nrelief from the Maths department\nfor it will give the signal to demolish the Registry, the Lyon\nPlayfair library and associated\nbuildings and to start the con- j struct ion of the long-awaited |\nmathematics Block. The delay\nhas not been due to any reluctance on the planning side but\nrather to the question of space;\nfor until there is somewhere to\naccomodate the books at present\nin the Playfair library and suitable\noffices found for the administrative staff their present quarters\nmust remain. This is not the first\ntime that this type of problem has\narisen. The Mechanical Engineering block for instance had to be\nbuilt in sections in order to maintain some continuity of academic\nstudy. This of course delayed the\nrate of building and is just one\nof the penalties of having a College in London.\nOther Developments\nFor the future we can expect to\nsee Linstead Hall open by early\nsummer, the Sports centre somewhat later and the Maths Block\nby 1971. Eventually the whole of\nPrinces Gardens is scheduled for\nnew Halls of Residence if and\nwhen funds become available.\nThoughts for\nthe Week\nOne of the main functions of\nICWA is \" to safeguard and advance the interests of women students of Imperial College.\" All\nthat is required is a short booklet,\nto be issued to all girls on\nFreshers' Day, called \" A Guide\nto the I.C.

    "content": "21 FEBRUARY1968 FELIX9 Patrick Rotherham interviews\nJOHN RENBOURN\nJohn Renbourn was born in\nLondon 24 years ago. On Wednesday, January 31st, he played\nto a packed folk club. His musical\nsources are wide ranging\u2014on\nWednesday, his material included\nWilliam Byrd's \"Lord Salisbury,\"\na Jelly Roll Morton Song, and a piece of modern Indian popular\nmusic. \" Lord Salisbury,\" was\noriginally written for lute, and\nwhen performing this John was\naccompanied by Terry Cox on\nglockenspiel; in some other numbers Terry also played hand\ndrums.\nRenbourn's great skill with the\nguitar is balanced by his easygoing stage performance. This\nwas very well received, and, supported by the regular college\nplayers, made for a successful\nevening.\nDuring the interval he spoke\nto Pat Rotherham.\nJohn, how long have you been\npaying guitar?\nI 've had a guitar since Chas\nMacDevitt was in the hit parade,\nwhenever that was, but I 've been\nplaying in London for three or\nfour years now, as a professional\nfolk singer. You change and you\nget better suddenly; particularly\nthrough hearing Davy Graham\nplaying. I first started playing\nblues when I first came up to\nLondon, Davy was around; and\nif you could hear him, you'd learn\na lot. I didn't really intend to be\na folk singer; I just happened to\nbe playing the guitar, and happened to get a few bookings; now\nI'm getting a fair amount of work\nas a folk singer. But I don't stop\nand say this is me, my job. I can\nremember when I started playing.\nIt wasn't like starting and getting\nbetter, and earning more money;\nit was just having a play, which is\nmore or less what I'm still doing.\nDid you lui ve any musical\neducation?\nI did music in school, and used\nto sing once in a while. I think\nI'm well up in music but I'm not,\nunfortunately.\nDid you ever plan to do anything else?\nYes, I went to art school, for a short period. I was going to be\nthe greatest artist the world has\never known, but that seemed to\nfall through. You've got to keep\na lot of things going, you can't just do one thing. If you've got\nno fixed plans you're not brought\ndown when you don't make it.\nYou mentioned Davy Graham\nav an influence on you\u2014what\nothers have there been?\nGuitar players? Naturally\nI 've got mv favourites, but whether they influence you or not is\nanother matter.\nFavourites then?\nIt goes in bands. I like a lot of\nmedieval music. Have you heard\nGuillaume de Machaut, a French\ncomposer?\nOnly of Palestrina\nThis guy was writing about two\ncenturies before him, writing\nthree part things\u2014he was the\nfirst guy to write a full mass. It's unbelievable, beautiful. There's a lot of guys on the jazz scene\nwho play music I like. I like\nCharles Lloyd, Ornette Coleman.\nNaturally Muddy Waters, people\nlike that.\nThe Americans seem to be\nahead of us in many fields. Do\nyou think this is so in folk?\nNot really. Naturally they are\nin things which we imitate. I mean, I'm nowhere as a blues\nguitarist compared to real blues\nmusicians. But there's a lot of\nmusic in England, like traditional\nmusic, which goes on in other\nforms of music, Benjamin Britten,\npeople like that. I think this\n\\ photon\nethyl \\ /\nv alcohol \\ /\n^concave\nmirror\nfig. l stamps British music. Maybe\nthe influence will continue, and\nsay in a hundred years time people will be writing symphonies\nwith electric guitar, as an English\ninstrument. Does that make\nsense?\nCould you tell me about the\ngroup you're in, the Pentangle?\nThere's Bert Jansch, Jacqui\nMacShee, Terry Cox, who played\ntonight, and Danny Thomson on\nbass. Danny's one of the new\nheads on the jazz scene. It's very\nhard to get into the jazz scene,\nand suddenly he's got recognised.\nHe's very free, he's interested in\nfolk ideas as well.\nYou play regularly in London?\nYes, at the Horseshoe in Tottenham Court Road, every Sunday.\nWhat do you play?\nIt's a mixture of five people\nwith five ideas going at once; but\nwe all start off on mutual ground.\nBlues is common to both scenes,\nso we play a few blues : but\nmostly either blues-based, or\nnumbers I 've written with Bert,\nor that he's written in his style,\nwhich become mixed; and the\nbass line's been added. There's a lot of free playing\u2014come do.v n sometime.\n/ mean to. Now, this evening\nyou've played Byrd and an Indian\npiece. Do you go much to other\ntypes of music?\nI play anything I particularly\ndig. But they all come into my\nidea of playing the guitar whether\nit's raga music or anything. I don'tpl av Indian music, I play\nguitar, a bit of that, a bit of something else. I 've got a few things\ngoing, writing for other instruments. I did a thing for oboe,\nand that took a lone time to write\ndown. I like the idea of writing\nfor parts. That's mv present in-te rest, just to use the guitar as\none or two lines, as a feature\ninstrument. The stuff I play is\nan attempt to play everything at\nonce, which is idiotic . It should\nbe one line, with say viole, re-corder, oboe.\nFolk music is often connected\nwith being on the road. Have you\ntravelled much?\nThat was a long time ago!\nI 've not travelled as much as\nWoody Guthrie. I 've just been\nto France and Cornwall.\nDo you write when you're on\nthe road?\nI think it's a tremendous scene,\nbecause you feel you're really on\nyour own, with no strain, you can\ngo anywhere you like. You sit\ndown you may as well play. - If\nit's a nice day you play better, if\nyou've met someone nice you\nplay better still. Most of the\nstuff I 've worked out has been\ndone when I 've been in such a ridiculous easy situation, at a good place. It reflects, you feel\nlike playing.\nHave you got any LP's coming\nout?\nI 've got one half finished.\nThere's this thing I mentioned\nwith parts. I 've got this guy\nlooking at it, to make sure all the\nnotes are there, that it's presentable for other musicians. If he\nthinks it's okay, we'll get some\nmusicians together and try it.\nThe record should be out in about\nthree months time.\nDo you have a free hand with\nrecordings then?\nYes, Transatlantic's a small\ncompany; it's a folk label and\nthey don't mind what you do.\nThe records sell to a folk audi-en ce, and you can play exactly\nwhat you want to do. You\ncouldn't with\nLastly, ha v the future?\nWell, I 'll\namon aster11 th cent tir with my b! moat, catch\nve y c.:. ir/ Ay p.i plains oc gcI toe IV i va tuna Ssft.\nfor ban fitting\non a column\nWe regret to announce the death of Colcuft, who fell from the\ntop of his tower just after writing the letter published on page 4.\nFew tears need be shed at his passing, since he has in the past be-fa/ller a similar fates (usually at the end of a session due to over celebration of the end of his exams) and each time been reincarnated\nin j a different form. Until his return his duties will be taken over\nby Andy Jordan. last week would belong to another\nI had of course got it wrong. I age. The Flippant equation for\nhad expected Ray Flippant to student grants is\nstart the Union meeting of two\nweeks back with a discourse on\ninvisible students. It turned out\nto be Ray Phillips on disguised\nstudents : those who are somewhere in between. A few more\nto add to the range. And the\nrange of IC students is sometimes\namazing. PG's here have between\nthem around 500 kids: civil engineers are a particularly prolific\nlot. There are explanations but\nperhaps they all failed on dams.\nBut why don't we have a few\ninvisible students? \" Mr. X, an\nunknown and unseen member of\nIC, was last week elected ICU\npresident by a unanimous council.\nMembers of council claimed to\nknow the other candidates well\nenough to have had to vote for\nX.\" So Felix in the summer.\n\" Ian Balls, a minor president,\nsaid \" This just goes to prove that\ncouncil knows best for the\nUnion.\" When asked \" Which\nUnion?\", Balls said \" Mine, of\ncourse.\"\nIt was indeed fascinating to\nwatch members of the executive\nget up to n rot ect their authority.\n\" Council knows the candidates \"\nwas the continuing theme. Which\nexplains wh v the Union doesn't know the candidates. Perhaps\nPlato's oligarchy would have enjoyed their authority too. But\nmost of us find things Platonic\nfrustrating.\nWiiat would be the difference\nto the Union if Mr. X did get\nelected? Very little to most\nstudents who rarely see their\npresident anyway. If IC students\nhad to elect their president, it\nwould probably mean that more\nwould know who he was. \" Who\nis Ray Phillips anyway?\" probably meant nothing to quite a number of students.\nAnd after the endless arguments about apathy, it might induce a certain amount of interest.\nCandidates would have to appeal\nto the electorate (!) and would\nhave to understand the student\nbody. The frippery of Flippant\nat the student finance meeting\nGrant x Quality of student\n= constant.\nRemarkable mathematics from\na scientist. Rob Collinge had\npointed in this meeting to the survey she wing that around 5 per\ncent of IC undergraduates are\ngetting more than \u00a330 less than\ntheir proper grant. It is not surprising that students are apathetic when their representatives\nseem to be apathetic towards\nthem.\nSo unfortunately IC Union rejected the suggestion that it is\ncompetent to select its senior rep-resent at ive. But who is likely to\nbe the next President? The\nobvious candidates are those already on council. Chris O 'Donnell says he won't be here. Bob\nMacknian has a finite chance, he\nsays, of coming back; but in typical style he refused to commit\nhimself on the Presidency. With\nstriking honesty, Martin Lack\ndoesn't know if he will be back\nbut \" I don't know if I could do\nit.\" Jane Pearson hasn't even\ngot round to considering it. Rex\nLowin says definitely \" No.\"\nSomebody else who won't be\naround is Barbara Hedge but\nshe said \" I shall stand. I mean,\nit doesn't say anywhere that you\nhave to be here for it.\" And will\nKeith Guy stand for a third time?\nWe shall have to wait and see.\nThe only outside candidate mentioned to date\u2014Paul Bradley\u2014\nmay not be back, but is considering standing for the presidency\nand \" will definitely stand for\ncouncil.'\" Neither is this my bid.\nAnd why, you ask, am I asking\nthis question now? Because it\nseems rational to have the democratic elections in this term like\nother universities; then we\nwouldn't have the problem of the\nelections interfering with exams.\nA staff-member is quoted as\nha vine said recently that \" union\npoliticians are either insatiably\nambitious or retarded a doles cents.\" Next year's president will\nprobably have to be insatiably\nadolescent.\nAlexis\nKorner\nAlexis Korner appeared at I.C. on Friday 2nd of February.\nEarlier the same week John Renbourn was on at the folk club,\nand it was interesting to compare,\nthe styles of the two.

    "content": "6 FELIX21 FEBRUARY1968 PLAN FOR SURVIVAL Just what is going to happen to our Union in the next few years ?\nI think that one of the most important single items will be the\neventual fee increase f iom \u00a34 per capita to \u00a37. This increase was\napproved by the Board of Governors, but has been held up by the\n* TJGC At present we are overspending our grant by about \u00a31,000\na year, and the Governors are paying tli is deficit for us until the fee\nincrease is allowed.\nTOTAL STUDENT INCOME\nINCOME PROVIDED\nBY THE COLLEGE\nATHLETIC\nCOMMITTEE\nSTUDENTS\nFINANCE\nCOMMITTEEICU COUNCIL\n(\nCHAIRMAN I PRESIDENT tCu)\n(CMMIVMAN :\nXOK TREASURER ICU)\nGENERAL\nRESERVE r FUND\nCLUB\nCOMMITTEES\nATHLETIC\nGROUND\nBOAT\nHOUSE\nSQUASH,\nTENNIS,\n* FIVES\nCOURTS\nSILWOO0\nPARK\nICWA\nIC\nUNION\nEXPENSES\nENTERTAINMENTS\nCOMMITTEE\nCLUBS, SOCIETIES ETC OF\nTHE CONSTITUENT\nCOLLEGE UNIONS\nSave Now Spend Later When we have the extra money, our first task will be to build\nup our reserve fund. This we can do by investing up to \u00a38,000 per\nannum for the first few years. We shall need to make these giant\nsavings in preparation for the future, as we cannot expect another\nincrease for many years.\nSome of the money wil i have to go on refurnishing present\nUnion buildings, and also on developing the new Union premises in\nCollege block, due to be opened in Summer 1969.\nEven after these schemes, there should still be money left to\nexpand the activities of the Union's clubs and societies. It should be\npossible to cater for more members, particularly in the new Sports\nCentre, and to finance ambitious projects which require large capital\ninvestment. For example the Sailing club's proposal to buy a seagoing yacht, which, whilst requiring an outlay of about \u00a33,000, would\nsave money for the Union over the years. Perhaps we can finance\nseveral projects like this when we have the capital available.\nWe will also need to examine\nvery carefully the system of giving subsidies to clubs and so cie ties. At present, the subsidy is\nroughly in proportion to t ne cost\nof t ne activity. This means that\nmembership of one of the social\nclubs, for example, usually carries\na very small subsidy, whilst membership of an athletic club can\ncarry a substantially larger one.\nShould this status quo continue\nto be accepted?\nMuch more could also be done\nto provide general facilities, such\nas newspapers and televisions, in\nthe Union buildings. These would\nbe used by all Union members,\nwhether active in clubs or not.\nAfter all, everyone contributes an\nequal amount to the Union's in-come.\nE CC? The structure of the Union will\nalso need to change over the next\nfew years. One very workable\nsuggestion is the setting up of an\nEntertainments Clubs Committee\n(ECC). This would be made up\nof the chairman of the Entertainments Committee, and the chairmen of clubs such as Jazz\nClub, Film Soc. and Dram. Soc.\nIt could then function along the\nsame lines as the present ACC,\nRCC and SCC. This move is\nnecessary because these clubs, at\npresent part of RCC, have a very\nspecialized financial structure,\nwith large amounts of money\ncoming in and going out at times\nof performances. They also differ from other clubs in that their\nmej ii be rs tend to give entertainment rather than receive it. A previous experiment was to run\nsome of these clubs as part of the\npresent Entertainments Committee. This failed, basically because\nthe setup was not suitably designed to exercise the careful financial control needed.\nNew Ideas A considerable expansion of\nother Union activities is also just\nbeginning. The Welfare and External Affairs Committees are in\nthe process of being written into\nthe Union constitution. There are\nsufficient new ideas being considered by these committees that\nthey should both cover an extremely wide range of interests in\nthe near future. For example, the\nWelfare Committee might have to\ndivide into sections on Housing,\nHealth, and Finance, all the\nsize of the present committee.\nIn addition, a similar Union\ncommittee on Halls of Residence\nand Student Houses may be required soon, to cover the hoped\nfor expansion of the Student\nHouses scheme. Another very\nvaluable setup is the Academic\nRep. system of the constituent\ncolleges. There is great scope at\npresent for students to help in the\nimprovement of undergraduate\ncourses. Perhaps the groups from\nthe three constituent colleges will\ncome together to further their\ncauses.\nChange at Top At the top of the Union, the\nstructure of the executive will\nhave to change. Officers of IC\nUnion, from its clubs and sub-committees, will replace the constituent college Presidents. This\nis because the work of IC Union,\nand of its executive, will certainly\nexpand in the next few years. The\nconstituent college Presidents,\nwho already concentrate largely\non their own unions, will find constituent college activities taking\nup all of their time. Therefore,\nother officers of IC Union will be\nrequired to share the increased\nadministrative load. In addition,\nthere will be a concentration on\nmatters common to all students\nby IC Union, whilst the constituent colleges deal with their own\nspecialized interests, and foster\ninter-college rivalry.\nPresidential Duties The President undertakes a great deal of ICU administration\nat the moment, including almost\nall of the negotiations with the\ncollege Administration. I think\nit is this increasing work load that\nhas led to the President becoming\nless and less of a public figure\nthroughout my time at IC. In\nturn, this has played no mean\npart in the fall of general interest\nin the running of the Union, and\nin the difficulties of getting a quo rate union meeting. To combat this falling interest must be\none of the mo.;t immediate tasks\nof the Union, and it is for this\nUNION FINANCE\nreason that I advocate a changed\nexecutive, and a public ballot for\nthe office of President.\nThe question of a Sabbatical\nYear for the President will surely\nbe raised soon, following the outbreak of Sabbatical Years in\nother London colleges. This\nwould inevitably heighten the\npresent trend towards an administrator president, which could be\ndisastrous for the Union in its\npresent state. So I would suggest\nthat this is not a good idea for IC\nat the present time.\nNUS Finally, the perennial debate\u2014\nshould we join NUS? My personal view is that we should not.\nThis is because a strengthened\nICU will be capable of expressing\nits own opinions, without the help\nof NUS. We would almost certainly not agree with NUS on all\nissues, and we can use our proud\ntradition of independence to say\nwhat we think.\nREX J. LOWIN\nThe financial structure of the\nUnion is shown in the diagram.\nThe total Student Income is derived mainly from fees and a supplementary grant from the Governing Body. With the income\nfrom the Bookshop this totals\n\u00a320,000.\nOf this the constituent colleges\nget 18s. for each member (with\n\u00a3500 bonus for R.S. M.) and this\naccounts for \u00a33,800. The major\ndrain on Union funds is A.C.C. who absorb \u00a35,200: this does not\ninclude the costs of facilities such\nas land and building, but only\nequipment and other running\ncosts. R.C. C. receives a grant of\n\u00a32,800 and S. C.C. one of \u00a3800.\nIf clubs wish to spend any money\nabove their running costs they\nhave to apply to the Committee\nto which they belong. Should the\nrequired amount be too large for\nit to dispense, they can refer it\nto the Student Finance Committee which has \u00a31,800 to allocate\nas it chooses.\nThe bulk of the remainder\ngoes on running expenses and\nprestige items like the President's Dinner and Dance.\nTHERE' S ROT AT THE TOP Theis's asl or y about Ted Ncjdhatn at the time of a Union\nmeeting debating \" Union sport is puerile.\" \" I oppose this motion,\"\nhe said, \" because Union sport is no! pae rile enough.\"\nPerhaps for some that is true. But I don't believe that students\nhere are too irresponsible to be able to run their own affairs. And at\nthe moment they don't run their own business. It's done by a highly\nindirectly elected and largely self-perpetuating hierarchy. The problem of ICU at present can be reduced to one thing : communications.\nRemember Boston\n\" The home of the bean and the cod,\nWhere the Lowells talk to the Cabots\nAnd the Cabots talk only to God.\"\nToo many times, the serious talking is done within Council or\nwithin the Executive : The Union is rarely consulted for its ideas.\nMost people have their own ideas or grouses about the running of\n(heir Union. Council and the executive should merely be a tool of\nthe student body, not the reigning dynasty.\nwell-known\nBasic Problems\nBut this is all generalisation.\nWhat is the basic problem? At\nthe moment IC clubs of all kinds\ndo well out of ICU. Just how well\nthey do, tends to depend on how\nflourishing the v are. Most of the\nrest of the Union money goes on\nthe constituent college unions and\non the union buildings. I question\nthe basic priorities of this spend-ing. The priorities have been built\nup over the years and it does not\nseem that a fundamental review\nof them has been carried out re-cent ly. Anybody spending \u00a320,000\na year should think out the policy\nof its spending. And on the\ndistribution of the \u00a320,000 depends how effectively the different\nparts of the Union function. At\nthe moment, as an example, Ents\nare expected to make a profit and\nsub sid is e the President's Dinner\nand Dance: this\nevent is the opportunity for the\nUnion hierarchy to nosh together\nfor free. I think it might well be\nbetter for Ents to run at a loss\nwith better name hops, drawing\nmore internal rather than external\nstudents.\nBut who decides on these priorities? Everybody, I know, faithfully reads the Union bye-laws\nwhen they arrive here : the byelaws say 'tis council decides. And\nwho does council consult? Perhaps their own consciences,\nthough some may doubt that.\nIntegrate\nICU must become a more integrated whole, working together\nrather than in rivalry. For this\nreason, I believe that the constituent college unions are not at present fulfilling their real function.\nThere is no real difference between Guildsmen, Minesmen, and\nMackmen. Other than in academic matters there need be no\ndistinction. The constituent colleges may claim to be nearer to\ntheir members : I don't think\nthey use this to help IC as a whole. I should like to see a much stronger College-wide year\nrep. system. Reps would start to\nhave the function as advisers to\nboth Council and the Executive.\nThey would get the opinions and\nideas of their years as well as telling their years about what goes\non in IC. So people would be\nbetter informed, and Union members would have a much more obvious hand in what ICU does.\nThis power does exist now but in\nsuch a remote sense\u2014as one vote\nat a Union meeting\u2014that it is\nwidely regarded as non-existent,\nIt is not surprising that pe op e do\nnot care if they don't know what's happening and if they don't feel\nthey can do anything about it.\nExternal\nLinks\nIn addition, we must strengthen our links with other student\nbodies. We may not agree with\nall that NUS says, but as long as\nwe stay out we cannot influence\nthe actions of the major national\nstudent body. And because we\nstay out IC's voice goes unheard.\nWhat are our views on grant in-creases? Who are we going to tell\nand who will listen ? Inside NUS\nwe may influence its voice, which\nis listened to.\nCommunication\nSomebody said to me recently\nthat in ICU the bottom is apa-the tic, the middle rotten and there\nis nothing at the top. I was\ntempted to agree. I believe that\nwe should make the lines of communication through the IC student body better, so that student\nopinion may be better sounded\nand decisions better explained.\nBut also come back to the fact\nthat those who are elected cannot\nbe better than their electors.\nANDY JORDAN.\nDEVALUATION\nESCALATION\nRACIAL SEGREGATION\nDo you need\nInformation or\nSimply Edification ?\nExercise your own\ndiscrimination by\nvisiting the\nHALDANE\nLIBRARY\nOpen 10-7\n(10-5.30 Wednesdays)\n\n"

    "content": "21 FEBRUARY1968 FELIX OF THE\nSTATE\nIC UNION\nLast Thursday saw the second unsuccessful attempt to continue the only quo rate Union Meeting of the session. It seems a little difficult to understand why it is\nimpossible to attract a little over 8% of IC's students to a meeting which was\nto discuss grants. . . . . . . . . \u00ab\n_\nRay Phillip's plea that this second fail iure was due to bad publicity may be\nvalid, but w fiat is probably more valid is that people do not know what the\nUnion does and see no reason to attend.\nIn this supplement FELIX has attempted to show what the Union does for\nyou, how it spends its money and how its President sees it. In addition two members of Council have written suggesting improvements in the Union, and there\nis a 'rogues gallery'of the more important people in the Union. It is hoped that\nthis wi H help to make the next Union Meeting quo rate. a president's eye view\nIn order to get the view of the President on the Union and to\ngather some information on w li at the President's job entails FELIX\ninterviewed Ray Phillips.\nThe President began by making the statement that in his view\nhe is fortunate in having the constituent college system, which took\nmost of the work on academic matters off ICU on to the constituent\ncollege unions. This leaves him with overall administrative problems\ninvolving the Union and College as a whole.\nWhat do you consider to be the job of the President and what\nshould be the relationship between the Union, Council and President ?\nHe considers that the most im\nport ant part of his job is in coordinating with the administration\nof the College. As chairman of\nCouncil he does not think that he\nshould necessarily be completely\nimpartial, since the president is in\ni position to know more about a lot of matters put before Council\nthan other members. As chairman of Union meetings he tries\nto be much more impartial and\ntries to see that minority viewpoints are expressed.\nDo you work to any broad policies in how you carry out your\njob?\nHe said that he tries to represent what he considers to be the\nstudents' interests as realistically\nas possible, tries not to let pe o ple's excessive enthusiasm take\nprecedence over practicability\nand to keep an open mind.\nTo what extent should the President act on his own initiative ?\nAs far as possible he tries to\nrepresent the students' viewpoint\nas he interprets it. If he receives\na letter addressed to him as President, asking for his ideas in the\nlight of his experience he answers as he thinks the students\nwould want him to. Sometimes\nquick action is necessary when it\nis not possible to consult people\nbeforehand. This is one of the\nthings for which he was elected.\nDo you think there is enough\ncommunication between the grass\nroots of the Union, Council and\nthe executive ?\n\" In a word\u2014no.\" The executive is only a sub-committee of\nCouncil and reports on what action it has taken to Council at\neach meeting. The executive committee itself is not necessarily a powerful body, but the executive\nhas power because it is composed\nof people with power. If, for\ninstance, the Welfare Committee\nwere composed of powerful people then it, too, would be a powerful body in the Union.\nHe sees no problem of communication between the executive\nand Council, but thinks the main\none is that of communication between the Union and Council. To\nthis end he has tried to encourage\nobservers at Council meetings,\nthe numbers of whom have averaged about 15 at the three meetings so far this session. He sees\nCouncil as a rough equivalent of\nParliament, except that Parliament probably has more spectator\nappeal. He thinks that FELIX is\nthe most important means of informing Union members of what\nGIRLS!!!\nGET' IN GEAR' NOW IN KENSINGTON with the liveliest \"with it\" GEAR at lowest prices4448 KENSINGTON HIGH STREET happens at Council. He pointed\nout that communication is a two-way process and that many of the\nrepresentatives did not know\nwhat the people they are supposed to be representing think.\nHe does not think that the reps\nshould be mandated, as this destroys the point of any discussion\non an issue. He sees the setting\nup of the floor reps' \" surgeries\nas an admission of defeat by these\npeople that they have lost touch\nwith the rest of the Union. In\nthis case they are either bad floor\nreps or the Union is bad for not\ninsisting that its views are represented. Is there anything you would like\nto see the Union do, which it\ndoes not do now ?\nHe said that there were a lot\nof things that the Union could do,\nbut did not think in most cases\nthat it should. Examples were\nthe setting up of a West London\naccommodation bureau or a nursery . These could come as ideas\nfrom the Union but were better\nput into practice by the College,\nsince the Union had neither the\ntime nor the expertise to do this\nas well as the College could. He\ncited student houses as an example of this, where the Union\nhad interested the College in the\nidea.\nDo you think there is a case for\na sabbatical year for the President?\nHe said that he thought that\nPresidents who had sabbatical\nyears were usually looking around\nfor something to \" poke their\nnoses into.\" If the constituent\nColleges did not exist he thought\nthat a case could be made out\nfor a sabbatical year, but as it is\nhe does not have to liaise between\nthe students and the individual\ndepartments, so the amount of\nwork he has to do does not justify\none. He made the point that\nstudent politics \" with a small 'p' and in inverted commas \" should\ntry to involve as many people as\npossible in running the Union.\nA sabbatical year would leave\nmany of the people at present\nhelping in Union affairs with little\nto do. With a sabbatical year\nthere would probably be even\nmore complaints of autocracy by\nthe President.\nWhen invited to make any fur-further comments he said that he\nthought at the moment that there\nwas a\" gap of logic \" on Council.\nThe Union General Meeting has\nthe final say in what goes on in\nthe Union and yet Council wants\nto throw off representatives of the\nUnion e.g. constituent college\npresidents and chairmen of clubs\ncommittees from its sub-commit'\ntees and replace them with rep\nresent at ives of Council.\nHe sees the current attempt to\ngive more power to Council as an\nattempt by some people to gain\npower for themselves. Some\nCouncil members seem to be\nthere for their own egoism with\nsome Union officers trying to\nmake a name for themselves in\na year by pursuing one issue. He\nended by saying that Council is in\na confused state at the moment.\nARE YOU\nAPATHETIC\nOR DON'T YOU KNOW? Wfiat does t lie average I.C. Union member want from I.C. Union? Does lie (or she) contribute to the general in qu c racy of ICU\nmeetings. Is he impressed with our Itallowed Executive and Council\nor doesn't he know who they are'! The answer to these questions are\ngiven by an unbiased (we hope) random sample of Union members\nwho responded to our snap survey.\n145 people answered the questions : 47 First year, 38 Second year,\n49 Third year and 1\n1 P.

The reasons they gave ranged from being put off\nby previous years' experience to finding General Studies more interest-ing. Those who went generally were unimpressed and made accusations of time-wasting, petty squabbling and a great deal of debate\nirrelevant to the average student. Several people commented that\nconstituent College Union meetings were much more lively and others\nsaid that ECU. meetings had gone slowly downhill over the past few-years.\nCouncil Unimpressive\nWhen asked which facets of the Union they considered important,\nthere were roughly equal votes for Clubs (118,) Welfare (99), and\nSocial facilities (95). A few other facets such as food, staff-student\nrelations and contacts with N.U.S. were mentioned. One true patriot\nactually claimed to think FELIX important. The overlapping question\n\u2014\"What do you want from the Union?\"\u2014seemed to be rather\ndifficult for people to answer. General feelings were that it should\nprovide a place to meet people and to give them something to do.\nOthers wanted representation on the Governing Body, ac com moda tion, more intercollegiate spirit and approximately 1.38 per cent\nwanted Home Rule for Wells Soc.\nWould you know how to contact a member of Council?\nTo this question, 96 answered YES and 49 NO, so it seems that\nCouncil members are reasonably well-known and approachable. However, included in the Noes are several who didn't even know what\nCouncil is.\nAre you impressed with the Executive and Council?\nYes Moderately No\n0\n0\n3\n1\n4\n1\n1\n12\n1\n32\n17\n16\n23\n4\n60\nDon't know\n19\n14\n1\n1\n4\n48\n1st Year\n2nd Year\n3rd Year\nP.G.

Only 10\nmins. after the start with I.C. well on top, Pine was forced to\ntake an early bath with a pulled\nback muscle. With Dodson playing a great game at scrum half,\nKelly soon scored a very good try\nresulting from some slick handling\nof the greasy ball. Swinnerton\nconverted.\nRoyal Free replied with a penalty and so at half time, 5-3\nto I.C. Soon after the interval,\nDuke scored a superb solo try,\nborn of sheer guts and de termina tion, and a myopic disregard for\nthe wall of Royal Free players\nthrough which he ran. Unfortunately the enemy replied with two\neasy penalties and despite heroic\nefforts in the last 10 mins. with\ntwo trys disallowed, I.C. ended up\nthe most unlucky losers at 8-9.\nYet again the gods seem to\nhave deserted us in the cup but\nwe must now c once n ln te on\nbuilding a good \" sevens\" team\nfor the U.L. U. tournament and\non enjoying the remaining\nmatches.\nBOB PINE\nEton\nFives\nThe Eton Fives Gub, which is\nonly in its second year of exist-en ce, is going from strength to j strength. Last term two I.C. pairs\neasily defeated Old Westminster\nCitizens Eton Fives Club, their\nfirst ever victory.\nLast Fitday I.C. again played\nOld Westminster Citizens, but\nthis time they put out some of\ntheir best pairs. In the three\npairs match I.C. lost 2-1 but the\ntwo games which were lost were\nvery close indeed, two deuce\ngames in the case of I.C.'s second\npair.\nFrom match to match the standard of I.C. seems to get higher\nand the influx of first years already having considerable talent\nhas been more than an asset. The\nclub's active members are not\nreally very many and anyone at\nI.C. who played Eton Fives at\nschool to some degree of proficiency and is still interested in\nplaying should get in touch with\nPaul Alexandre, Chem.

It clarifies the way Ents arrange and run their\n\" informal dances \" (or hops for the uneducated); it defines areas of\nresponsibility. This means that the chairman can castigate any member\nof Ents who fails in his duty by simply quoting the relevant article\nand sub-section. The constitution tightens up the way Ents handles\nits takings. By simple devices such as numbered tickets it eliminates\nas far as possible any dishonesty there might be among Ents. It\nrequires the chairman to attend Council meetings, to report to Ents\nthe fulminations of Council and vice-versa. It provides a sliding scale\nby which to price hop tickets and a system of splitting hop profits\nbetween Ents and the society sponsoring that hop. This provides for\nthe society, who run the hop on Saturday night, to take a maximum\n\u00a330 out, while Ents, responsible for booking, publicity and tickets,\nscoop the rest. Below \u00a360 the profits are shared equally. There is\nalso a clause forbidding members of Ents to pronounce publicly on\nEnts matters not their own responsibility; this will enable the true\nfacts about Ents to be propagated, it is hoped.\nWho wrote the constitution? better than it has for the past two\nThe credit for the finished_ product years . . .

They maintained this)\nlead to gain an easy victory.\nSoccer Club\nAfter a temporary de moral is a tion after being knocked out of\nthe U.L. Cup, I.C. are back on\nthe winning trail and are slowly\nclimbing back up the league. Last\nWednesday I.C. beat Woolwich\nPolytechnic 3\u20140 in a good match\nat Harlington.\nThe pitch was rather heavy but\nalthough the Woolwich team were\nbigger man for man, I.C. seemed\nto oe much more at home in the\nmud. The first twenty minutes\nsaw some fast and good football\nfrom both sides but no goals\ncame. Then I.C. got two quick\ngoals both taken very well by in-side-left Mike Eastell and seemed\nto control the game to half time.\nIn the second half Woolwich\nseemed more determined and did\nmuch of the attacking but failed\nto score, Stuart Hewardine having a good game in goal. With\nten minutes left Hopwood tried\na left-foot centre only to see the\nball crash into the corner of the\nnet\u20143-0 and a very competent\nperformance by I.C. is shared between Keith Guy and\nDermott Corr, although each\nclaims to have done the major\nportion of the spadework. Nevertheless it is an example of cooperation between two leading\nplayers in an example of what\nhas been the bane of this year's Ents\u2014the \" personality clash.\"\nLast term the secretary resigned,\nfor that cause; this term there was\nserious talk of the chairman,\nsecretary and treasurer taking\nthe plunge together for this rea-son. Guy has been accused of\nvarious faults in his chairmanship of the committee; soon after\nthe beginning of this term Ents\nwent through a bad patch in\nwhich they lost \u00a370 on the Zoot\nMoney hop and the Plastic Fairytale died unhappily. To stop both\npoor chairmanship and poor\nhandling of hops two alternatives\nappeared. One was that Guy plus\nsecretary Gordon Sage and treasurer Jacques Robinson resign, to-get her. The other was that a constitution be written. Just how\nvociferously and wholeheartedly\nthe Ents cohorts clam our ed against the resignation of their\nleader is a matter of opinion.\nNevertheless the constitution has\nnow been written and the bickering is (hopefully) over.\nRunning We 11\nIn fact, to judge from the optimistic Keith Guy, Explosion is\nEnts! or to put it more prosa-ic ally, \"this year's Ents is running\nI think they trust me\u2014we are\nall trying to improve the entertainments at I.C.\" So far Ents\nhave \u00a3415 stashed away in the\nkitty, most of this collected inside\nthe last month. A target figure of \u00a3450 has been set by Council, but\nJacques Robinson reckons Ents.\ncould top \u00a3700. As regards\nthe standard of the groups\nplaying at EC, Guy rates it as\nsuperior to most London colleges\nand a great improvement on last\nyear. Acts that have played or are\nto play here include the relatively\nbig-time names of Ben E. King,\nDantalion's Chariot, the Moody\nBlues, the Marmalade, the Geranium Pond and Elmer Gantry's Velvet Opera; for May Ball,\nGeorgie Fame plus Brian Auger\nand Julie Driscoll are projected.\nThe current policy is away from\n\" cattle-markets \" and functional\npublicity towards freaky posters\nand more worthwhile music.\nFa i ry taI e What happened to the Eairytale? \" Trends are fickle, \"said\nGuy. It had a good atmosphere,\nbut competition with Friday night\nHall parties helped to kill it\u2014\ndead with a deficit of \u00a38. Since\nits death releases a good deal of\nl about for other things, Ents\nshould, one hopes, go from\nstrength to strength during the\nrest of the session, after their\nprevious setbacks.

    "content": "4 FELIX21 FEBRUARY1968 CEDITOR'Somme nt Each year the Union gets larger and each year the amount of\nmoney handled gets correspondingly greater. As a consequence of\nthis the amount of responsibility vested in the members of the Union\nelected to the various posts, whether it be the President or a committee member of a club, becomes more and the more people who are\nbeing represented and the more activities going on the less time there\nis to see those people. \" Who is Ray Phillips anyway?\" says Joe\nBtoggs. \" Who is Joe Bloggs, anyway?\" says Ray Phillips.\nThis is but one facet of a problem for too long neglected in our\nrapidly growing Union\u2014that of communication between the various\nparts. I make no apology for the fact that one or two other writers\nin this issue have dealt to some extent with this subject, in fact the\nword \" communication,\" or rather the lack thereof, seems to be\nheading for the same sort of status once accorded to \" apathy \" as the\nuniversal scapegoat for all IC Union ills. I claim no such thing, but\nI do think that this is one of a number of causes of the present lack\nof inter cut shown by most students towards Union affairs. The lack\nof contact between the people supposedly running the Union and the\nmain body of the Union is a manifestation of the inadequacy of what\nI shall term vertical communication. Lateral communication, at least\nat the level of the clubs, is, if anything, worse. Here we have a case\nof the left hand not knowing what the right is doing if ever there was\none. A society will arrange a meeting with no idea of what it may\nclash with (unless it is a Monday and we all know what Monday\nnight is), nor of whether other clubs are holding meetings on similar\ntopics, this has happened between Maths & Phys Soc and Wells Soc\nseveral times last session, both IRC and Pol Soc Council arranged\nmeetings entitled \" Vietnam\u2014the abuse of science \" (Pol Soc have\nnow abandoned the \" abuse of science \" bit from both the title and\ncontent of the programme to avoid too much overlapping), while Ents\nmissed the opportunity of booking a top group cheaply because they\ncould not find out the date of RCS Carnival.\nAnd so to the eternal editorial question : What is to be done? In a vertical direction two starts have already been made. One is Ray\nPhillips' system of using year reps to publicise Union meetings to their\nyears, a system carried further in RCS where informal year reps\nmeetings are held to filter ideas upwards\u2014\" Communication is a two-way process \"\u2014Phillips\u2014as well as to inform the masses. Some members of Counc'l would like to see this adopted on an IC basis. The\nother is Andy Jordan's idea of holding \" surgeries \" on Tuesday and\nThursday lunchtimes when Union members could see floor reps\non Council about any problems or ideas they may have which Council\ncould deal wi di. Excellent as the idea is I am not sure whether most\nUnion members wii l overcome their natural reticence to go and see\nthem.\nIn a lateral direction there seems at present to be no other means of\ncommunication than informal contact between members of the respective com mi 'tees. And with eighty clubs and societies, not counting\nconstituent College clubs . . .Once upon a time there was a diary for\nputting details of meetings in. True, not many people used it, but\nsurely it was better than nothing. Perhaps it should be resurrected,\nwith the clubs committees kicking those clubs who did not use it.\nCAREERS ADVICE\nWhilst vaguely on the subject of communication or, mo.e accurately,\nthe dissemination of information, it is good to hear of the Rector's action on careers advice. At the moment there is little or no well-informed comprehensive advice available in this College on career\nopportunities, particularly outside of one's immediate studies or on\npostgraduate courses. This is not to say that the staff of the various\ndepartments do not do their best, in fact I am sure they do, but their\nknowledge of possible opportunities is necessarily extremely limited.\nIt is to be hoped that more advice, not just on careers, will be\navailable to young people soon. One that springs to mind is the\nchoice of Universities and courses whilst at school. If more such\nadvice were available then many of the frustrations and failures, which\nI am sure are caused by following the wrong course at the wrong\nUniversity, would be avoided.\nSTUDENT FINANCE\nLast week 'Student Life' appeared around the College for the\nsecond tr\nme. It is published by Educational Publicity (Partners) Ltd.,\nwho are advertising agents for a large number of student newspapers, including FELIX. Many universities and Colleges have banned 'Studen Life' out of hand, on the grounds that it will take advertising away from their own newspapers. Educational Publicity\nclaim that its aim is to attract advertising to student newspapers.\nThe FELIX board and Council have agreed that it should be given\na chance to see if it will do this. All proceeds from the sale of\n'Student Life' are going to the Union.\nX Imperial College\nLondon, S.W.7 Internal 2881\nTel. KEN 2963\nEditor : DAVID COOPER\nAsst.

However, I think the reason goes deeper than\nthis.\nMr. Kent implies that apathy\nis an abnormal state for intelligent\npeople but far from being un-usual, apathy is the norm for most\npeople. University is a complete\nmicrocosm of the society we live\nin; there are just as many reactionary, conservative people as\nanywhere else, just as few radical\nthinkers, just as many social\nclimbers as anywhere else, and\nwhat Mr. Kent does not realise\nGrants\nMeeting\nDear Sir.\nThe recent meeting on \" Student Finance \" in the Union could\nonly be described as pathetic.\nThe gentleman from NUS related a long tale of negotiations\nwith Gordon Walker on the subject of student hardship arising\nfrom inadequate grants. He ended\nby asking that if anyone was hard\nup would they please tell NUS because NUS couldn't find anyone\nwho was !\nThe lady from Radical Student\nAlliance displayed a great deal of\nthigh whilst seated and little coherence when standing and was\nabout as radical as a reactionary\nhen.\nThose who turned up to the\nmeeting represented only about\n3 per cent of the student body,\nindicating that about 97 per cent\nwere satisfied with their present\nfinancial arrangements.\nEverybody who spoke from the\nfloor either made irrelevant\nspeeches, paraded reactionary\nsentiment or spoke plain non-sense. With two exceptions : a gentleman who made a strong\npoint relevant to working class\nstudents and another who called\nattention to the plight of the postgraduate student.\nBILL THORNLEY\nNow Colcutt\nhits back!\nDear Mr. Shields,\nI am sorry I bore you.

George Orwell pointed\nout over thirty years ago in his\nessay \" England, Your England \"\nthat it would be impossible for a Hitler or a Mussolini to rise to\npower here because of the indifference of the common man and\nalso his suspicion of enthusiasm\nand disrespect of authority. The\nallegation, therefore, that all apathetic people are lazy is complete\nand utter rubbish.\nIt is this sort of vogue an<i unspecific criticism of something he\nclearly has not tried to understand\nwhich makes his letter vacuous\nand superficial. The phrase \"amor-p hous apathy \" sounds good but\nwhen analysed means some ting like \"ill-arranged indifference \"\nwhich makes no sense at all.\nHis last paragraph consists of\na long warning and ends on a hackneyed sentimental note which\nseems to sum up his sermon, bor-ing, naive and depth less. S.P. CHAMBERS\nMaths 1\nSir,\nWith reference to C.J. Kent's epistle last week, I would like to\nsym pathis e with 'this idea concerning \" inter-college rivalries.\"\nLet us all pretend that we are\nat school again, where no-one can\nbelieve that such a word as apathy\nexists, let alone amorphous\napathy.\nLet us construct a system where\neach of us is able to obtain points\nfor his or her respective college,\nall for the sake of a silver cup\n(kindly donated by a Mr. C.J. Kent) to be presented to the college with the most points at the\nend of each year.\nHe sav s, and Iau ote, \"the\nprime objective should be the uni\nfi cation ot the student body.\" Do\nI take it that he wants us to attend\na morning assembly? (We might\neven sing a hymn or better still\npray for unity).\nAgain, I must quote; \" for an\nactive body is a healthy body, and\nactive minds will become stagnant\nif we choose to ignore the facts.\"\nWhat facts? How can he have the\nright to general is e so much by\ndirectly implying that people who\ndo not take an active part in\nUnion affairs develop stagnant\nminds? What does he define as\na stagnant mind? Does one qualify if one does not go to Maths\nsherry parties; (come-see the staff\nin person) or participate in\nMorphy Day?\nThe potential dangers of people\nwith power at the back of their\nminds in such a renowned seat\nof learning as IC are frightening;\nand unless the myth of political\nascendancy (direct from Cassell's Concise English Dictionary) is\nexploded I can only imagine that\nthis my generation will become as\nvoid, or as sterile as the one\nwhich runs this, our, country at\nthe present.\nC.

(Could\nwe ask Mr. Lavin why the Americans would like to infest with\nplague the land they are \" defending \"?)\n(ii) would Mr. Lavin look under the entry \" fact \" in his dic-tio nary? Having done that could\nhe explain to us how basic facts\ncan be queried.\n(iii) Whether Mr. Lavin likes\nit or not it does so happen that\nthe Americans are the principal\noffenders in the abuse of science\nin the unfortunate Vietnam war\nand as such it was difficult for Dr.\nRose to accuse the Vietcong of indulging in these exercises. However, if Mr. Lavin believes that\nthe use of suicide squads is an\nabuse of science (and not an affront to the dignity of the human\nbeing) he could certainly accuse\nthe Vietcong of abusing science\nin Vietnam.\n(iv) Mr. Lavin suggests that Dr.\nRose's time would be better spent\nin discussing moral aspects of\nscience-based warfare. Could he\nsuggest how this can be done\nproperly without presenting intrinsically related facts as was\ndone here.\n(v) With the welfare of \"Felix\"\nreaders in mind could we request\nMr. Lavin to listen to lectures\nmore carefully before burdening\nyou with libellous remarks on\ndistinguished speakers.\nYours faithfully,\nP.R.

Two attempts\nwere made to restart the original\n(adjourned) meeting.

As the faithful trickled in\nthey were handed two typewritten\nfoolscap sheets each\u2014copies of the\nmarathon motion, due to be proposed by Derek Boothman and\nSpooks Duckett, that could extensively change the Union st ruc ture. More correctly, it is seven\nmotions in one\u2014each to be separately debated. Five minutes later,\nall, or nearly all, the sheets had\nbeen handed back.\nPresident Ray Phillips made a short speech before he closed the\nmeeting. He blamed \"poor publicity \" for the meagre attendance,\nand added that he would tell Constituent College publicists to back\nup the campaign to make ths next\nUnion meeting quo rate. In all\nfairness, however, the publicity\nboth for this meeting and for this\n-Business deferred\nterm has been good, with full\ncolour posters over most of the\ncollege. As Union Publicist Dick\nGentle pointed out, last year it\nwas virtually non-existent and attendances were perhaps a little\nbetter. \" It's very easy to blame\npub'i city,\" he said, \" but I'm not\nso sure. . . . The content a Union meeting just isn't interesting to most of I.C.\" It's unfortunate but ver v true\u2014and if you\nwere among the 150 faithful interested enough to want to talk\nconstitutional changes last Thursday, that's too bad.\nJOHN MULLALY.\nIC HEARS NUS AND\nRSA ON GRANTS\nAbout 100 IC students attended a meeting of the Political\nSocieties Council on \" Student Finance \" last Tuesday lunchtime in\na vain attempt to gain enlightenment on the problem of the proposed cut in the grants increase.\nLeon Kreitzmann, a Vice-President of the National Union of\nStudents (Geoff Martin, the President, who was to have spoken was\nunavailable) and Jan Midwinter of the Radical Students' Alliance\nspoke both about their respective organisations' attitudes to the grants\ncut and about their long-term aims in this field. The meeting was\nslightly spoiled by Miss Midwinter's tendency to score points off NUS\nat every opportunity.\nNUS View\nLeon Kreitzmann spoke first\nand immediately made the point\nthat grants have not gone up in\namounts comparable to the rise\nin the cost of living for several\nyears. At the moment an Advisory Panel on Student Awards is\ncompleting a report, which should\ndetermine an increase in the level\nof grants for the next three years\nand will be published towards the\nend of May. However, the Government have already announced\nthat in the light of the present\neconomic situation the presumed\nincrease will be slashed by 50 per\ncent. To express the Governmental and NUS attitudes to this\ncut and to other aspects of the\ngrants situation, Mr. Kreitzmann\ngave a brief resume of a recent\nNUS meeting with Patrick Gordon Walker, the Minister directly\nresponsible for student affairs.\nNUS told Gordon Walker that\nthey hoped the cut would only be\nfor one year after which the full\nvalue of the award would be paid,\nand also mentioned that they\nwould like to see an automatic\ncost-of-living review index which\nwould review student grants along\nwith the cost of living. Gordon\nWalker was not keen on the review index and said that as he\ndidn't know whether the economic policy would work this\nyear (sic) he was not going to be\ntied down to giving a specific date\nfor abolishing the 50 per cent cut.\nNUS then mentioned that a freeze\non hall, lodgings and refectory\nprices might help if the cut went\nthrough, to which the Minister\nJan Midwinter and Leon Kreiti\nmann\nreplied that he might approach\nthe University Grants Committee\nabout this, but he did not sound\nover-keen. Finally he said that he\nmight be prepared to change the\nmeans test so that the maximum\ngrant would be paid for parental\nincomes up to \u00a31,100 instead of\nup to \u00a3700 as at present. He also\ndropped in a quick comment\nabout a possible \"Hardship\nFund \" for the really struggling\nstudents.\nLeon Kreitzmann believes that\nhalf the battle will be won if students were made aware of their\nposition in society and their problems and if, correspondingly, the\ngeneral public could be educated\nas to why they should spend\nmoney on higher education. The\nNUS action on the grants cuts will\nbe to publicise student opinion on\nthem in the press and by. writing\nto MP's hoping to get a parliamentary debate so they can demonstrate to Gordon Walker\nwhen they meet him again in\nMarch (a rally will be held on\nMarch 3rd in Trafalgar Square)\nthat a united student body is lined\nup against him. Then towards\nthe end of May, when the halved\naward is announced, they |may\nhave to try something else.\nMeanwhile, he asks that students facing hardship while on a maximum grant should write to\nNUS and explain their difficulties.\nIn arguing with the minister. NUS\nseems to have no difficulty in\nshowing that when o a rents fail to\npav their contribution, a student\noften has to struggle, but the v have no evidence to prove that\nstudents receiving a maximum\ngrant are hard up. which is em-barras sing. RSA Line\nJan Midwinter then outlined\nthe RSA policy on student finance,\nwhich is to receive a definite wage\nfor all students. This, she feels,\nis merely asking for equal status\nwith the working members of the\ncommunity. R.S.A, in the in-teri m, opposes outright any cuts\nin grants and supports unflinchingly any action to counter the\nGovernment's\" out r ago us poli-cie s.\" After saying this she\nseemed to spend most of her time\nvilifying the NUS line and saying\nnothing constructive herself. However, after a quick interruption by\nChris O 'Donnell, she mentioned\nthat RSA were supporting the Art\nColleges Parliamentary lobby in\nMarch and were sanctioning a National Day of Student Activity\non May 1 st to show where student\nopinion lies on the grants issue.\nQuestions and comments from\nthe audience included Rob Collinge's claim, backed up by his\nreport on student grants, that\nstudents on average were not suffering hardship, a completely irrelevant speech by Ray Phillips to\nadd to the general rude rumblings\nby members of the Exec, and\nCouncil throughout the meeting,\nand the view of Les Ebdon,\nChairman of Soc Soc, that NUS\nshould link its action on grants\ninto a larger framework of action\non cuts in all social services.\nKreitzman replied to Ebdon that\nNUS had not got the majority of\nstudents behind them and tna i they would have to gain the support of the students who accept\na second class status in the world,\nbefore they could achieve any-thing.\nDONOVAN WILL PLAY Albert Hall Concert Saved\nWith bare seconds to spare\nbefore cancellation charges be jan to bite deep into Carnival's juicy\nkitty, Chris Palmer, dynamic\norganiser, finally announced that\nhe had definitely booked the sensational Donovan for Carnival's Albert Hall concert, March 81th.

The Menace of\nBureaucracy\nA couple of years ago, at a secret meeting in a darkened hall\nroom, a member of Council (who\nshall, of course, be nameless)\nallowed me my very first privileged glimpse of some Council\nminutes. He said\u2014and he was\nwrong\u2014-that they were confidential but that he trusted me not to\nshare my knowledge of the Student Finance Committee report\nwith unauthorised persons\u2014and\nI loyally kept silent until I discovered to my horror that these\nvital documents were generally\navailable in the Union Office\nand would be shown to whomsoever Robb might desire.\nThe attitude of the nameless\none was, however, more typical\nof this Union than most would\ncare to admit and to many of us\nthe marvellous mysteries of\nUnion bureaucracy remain\nshrouded for ever in an impenetrable fog of minutes, reports,\ninitials and matters arising. The\nsource of most decisions is\ndubious ; and even the con sci en tous student of those Epistles to\nthe Plebs, the Union Blue book\n(constitutions and advertisements\nfor clubs) and the Union Red\nBook (pictures of the President\nand advertisements for pubs) will\nremain ignorant of, for example,\nwho appoints the editor of\n\" Felix \" or what basis Council\nuses when distributing your\ntwenty-thousand quid.\nA seii es in which articles are\ninvited nn subjects dear to the\nwriters' heart*.\nThat Council sometimes seems\nequally ignorant is, of course, a result of this same, possibly un-deliberate, secretiveness. Its\nmembers, launched rapidly from\nthe obscurity of anonymous\nreaders of \"Felix\" to their precious seats round the Big Table\nWhere It All Happens, are\nelected to joint staff-student committees (ever heard of them ?) at\ntheir first Council meeting and\nexpected to approve the financial\nestimates for the year at their\nsecond. Finding that the important decisions have now been\ntaken \u2014 by somebody \u2014 they are\nsilent at their third meeting and\ntry and think of something to\nsay at their fourth. By their\nfifth meeting they feel almost at\nthe end of their term of office(the\naverage Council member only attends about 6.3 meetings during\nhis meteoric career) and start\nwondering vaguely who is going\nto be President next year. . .\nHaving cast their vote for the\napparent best of a bad lot at\nJoint Council, and having now\nsome idea of how it all works,\nthey retire to write imaginative\napplications for jobs (not forgetting to mention their great experience of administration and\nhandling people in Union work)\nand buy their Council ties (four\ninches wide at the bottom,\nmaroon with green sphinxes and\nyellow stripes, at 2/6 from the\nBookstall, a snob's nightmare\nideal for the English climate).\nSomehow the things they\nwanted to do have been left un-done, the things they wanted to\nsay unsaid. The few ideas that\nthey have produced have been\nswallowed in vague promises and\nforgotten minutes, and are lost\nand will have to be rediscovered\nand rediscovered again before\nthey will bear any fruit.\nWho now remembers why we\nhave a Halls of Residence Representative, or what he is supposed\nto represent to whom ? Who now\nremembers the purpose or even\nthe existence of Refectory Complaints Officers, the fruit of some\nancient conflict with the redoubtable and indestructible\nMooney ? Who was the original\nPublicity Officer whose \" Approved \" stamp is now wielded\nwith great skill by the Union re-ce pti on is t, and to whom is our\nPublicity Officer responsible for\nwhat ? What was the Welfare\nOfficer supposed to do when he\nwas not expected to report to\nCouncil about Welfare, a touching custom reluctantly revived\nthis year ? What was the External Affairs Committee on\nwhich Council was represented\nfor some years before it discovered that there was no such\nbody and it had better be reestablished ?\nSomebody sometimes has the\nsheer nerve to ask these ques-t ions, to interrupt the smooth,\ncomfortable flow of finance, reports and no other business ; but\nfor too many years too many\npeople at too many levels in the\nUnion have sunk quietly into an\nuncomprehending lethargy, arising only to groan when the few\nwho are still awake try and put\nacross a point of principle or a new idea.\nBureaucracy is vital to the\nrunning of any organisation, but\nit must be the means and not the\nend. For too long \" efficiency \"\nhas been the criterion for promotion in the Union hierarchy, and\nmen with initiative have found\nthat the great, untidy bure ac racy of this Union has been the last\nrefuge of thoughtless routine and\nroutine thoughtlessness. Unless\nI.C.

    "content": "21 FEBRUARY1968 FELIX WHAT' S IN IT FOR YOU? If you live in Hall on a large industrial grant, have no children\nand don't drink coffee, then there's nothing. On the other hand you\nmay have interests in grants, coffee bars, lodgings and nurseries.\nIf so there is plenty in it for you. Since the individual cannot advance\nhis interests in these matters himself, he may wonder who can.\nFor several years there has been someone somewhere who has\nbeen responsible for, or concerned with, student welfare but only this\nyear has there been anything positive to show for it. Rex Lowin\nthis year's welfare officer set about his task with enthusiasm unusual\nfor a member of council and formed a welfare committee of equally\nkeen and concerned students. This committee, though still unofficial\nand therefore able to act only as an advising body with no clearly\ndefined duties, looks after the important issues that no-one else\nis able or wishes to handle.\nCoffee Bar Have you ever desired a bite to\neat or perhaps a drink of a non-intoxicating nature whilst in college between the hours of last\nMooney and bed ? Those who\nhave, and they are numerous,\nhave all been thwarted by\nMooney's conservative arrangements A coffee bar was set up\nin Southside before it became the\nsocial centre it is now, but it was\na big flop. This has unfortunately\nconvinced the authorities that\nsuch a facility is not required.\nContrary to this the welfare committee believes there is a demand\nfor a focal point other than the\nbars, which could e as il v take t! ie\nform of a coffee bar. The committee suggests that the Southside snack bar should be open\nfrom j nid afternoon until 11 p.m. to sell co See, hot pies and any\nother food for which there is a demand. They point out that it\ncould easily be run by students,\nexcept perhaps on Saturdays\nwhen paid staff could be em-ploy ed. These proposals are\nbeing put before the refectories\ncommittee in the hope that they\nwill take action on them. If they\ndo IC could well end up with a very popular coffee bar, a welcome thought.\nNursery A need which has been partially satisfied by the welfare\ncommittee is that of a nursery\nfor married students. Difficulty\nhas been encountered in pursuing\nsuch a project because there is\nno means of telling how great the\ndemand for such a nursery will\nbe. As yet there is no list of\nmarried students at IC available,\nso the welfare committee cannot\ncontact the people who will provide the demand. A temporary\narrangement has been made with\nRCA for IC to share their nursery at a very modest charge\nThis service is open to any married student or member of staff\nbut the response has been slow.\nWhen the availability of a nursery is made known it is hoped\nthat more people will take advantage of it, with the possible\nresult of persuading the college\nauthorities to provide a room in\nIC expressly for the nursery.\nMeanwhile the welfare committee\nis concentrating on sorting out\nthe formalities of running a nursery and is pressing the registry\nto compile a list of married\nstudents.\nGrants Of more concern to the majority of FELIX readers is the\nstudents' grants controversy\nwhich has hit the headlines re-cent ly. The welfare committee\nseem to have taken over from the\npolitical societies in this field and have done a tremendous amount\nof research into the subject, not\nonly of grants but of student\nfinance in general. A survey was\nconducted last term to investigate where students' money\ncomes from and goes to. The\nreport drawn up from the survey\nconcluded that the means test\nworks satisfactorily in practice,\na blow to the student wages sup-porters, since all undergraduates\nget at least the major part of\ntheir grant and it stressed that a 'policy of reducing the cost of living for students was preferable\non a long term basis to increasing\ntheir grants. The obvious way of\nreducing the cost of living is to\nreduce the rents charged for\naccommodation ; this can be\nachieved by means of the Rent\nTribunal. There are many legal\nwrangles involved which are being investigated by the committee and if the outcome of the investigations is favourable the\nstudent may well find himself in\nthe happy position of paying a reasonable rent.\nAccommodation Student houses have also been\na major concern of the welfare\ncommittee but unfortunately circumstances have taken the responsibility for their promotion\nout of the committee's hands and\nthey have lost touch with the\nsituation. However the welfare\ncommittee can take the credit for\ngetting the idea of student houses\ninto practice. There is also a move afoot to provide an accommodation bureau in West London in an attempt to relieve the\noverworked ULU bureau and to\nprovide students in the area with\na local service.\nExpansion This is an outline of the major\nfields of operation of the welfare\ncommittee, seven very active\npeople who are concerned about\nstudents. Their future plans include a review of the college\nhealth facilities with the aim of\nmaking students more aware of\nthe service available to them. It\nseems strange that a committee\nwhich is handling investigations\nof such general concern as the\nwelfare committee should be unofficial and so little known. It\nis hoped that the next Union\nmeeting will be quo rate so a motion can be passed rectifying\nthe situation. Whether this is\nachieved or not it can be assumed\nthat the committee will handle\nany problems concerning student\nwelfare in an extremely competent manner.\nDICK MIDDLETON.\nRex Lowin and Babs Hedge, chairmen of the Welfare and External Affairs Committees.\nTHE FACTS OF LIFE The External Affairs Committee is a somewhat smaller body\nthan its Welfare counterpart. It\nconsists of six members, its chairman being the pert near-blonde\nBarbara Hedge. What is it con\ncern cd v. ith ? External Affairs.\nTo be more specific, the committee has two major eggs in its\nbasket, and a number of minor\nones. Its primary concern at the\nmoment is with the proposed cut\nin grants increase. Assuming all\ngoes well yesterday's Union\nmeeting should have seen the\nrelevant signs of action in a motion seeking at least partial remission from the economic axe.\nWhile it accepts that, given the\npresent national financial crisis, a degree of economic stringency is\nnecessary, it points out that London students away from home\nwill suffer to a greater extent than\nmost while i the Government's plan to cut the recommended\ngrants rise by half will reduce the\nstudent's income to below the\npreviously commonly accepted\nvalue of 1961, this with respect to\nthe current cost of living. The\nmotion backs up its argument\nwith detail from the Collinge report on student financial hard-ship, and its plea is intended for\nthe Secretary of State for Education in the form of a letter.\nFollowup \"This letter must be only the\nstart,\" said Barbara Hedge. \" We\nintend constructive action to follow it.\" Indeed it looks as if this\nshould be the case. Last year the\ncommittee did little, spent most\not its time arguing within itself,\nand told the Union next to nothing about its movements. This\nyear there is a set (handpicked)\ncommittee holding frequent\nmeetings. As well as stirring\nabout grants, it has done a good\ndeal in the field of \" reciprocal\nfacilities\" with the Royal College of Art. Furthermore the results will be publicized. In simple\nterms : we can now join RCA\nclubs provided they agree to it,\nand students at RCA can join\nours under similar conditions.\nFurthermore, and this is apparently better than it sounds, we can\neat in their refectories at certain\nhours of the day. The recommended clubs in RCA are the\nLiterary Soc. and the Music soc;\nthe food is claimed to be as good\nas, if not better than Mooney.\nPersonally, 1 hope that this too is\nonly the start. The more contact\nI.C. has with RCA, the better.\nPress Relations Apart from these two major\nissues, the committee has ar-ranged, or is about to arrange,\na number of other less important\nmatters. To give examples : a system of releasing I.C. news to\nthe national press has been\nworked out; and student concessions in the area are now being\ninvestigated.\nIdeas Wanted Like so many organizations in\nI.C. the External Affairs committee can use ideas and enthusiasm\nfrom the rest of the Union. If\nyou have any bees in your bonnet\nthat vo u consider relevant, see a member of the committee. You\nhave a wide choice : from the\nchairman, Barbara Hedse (Beit)\nto Chris Eriksson (Falmouth),\nStew Barnes and Pete Ruhemann\n(Beit), Vinod Garga, or Mike\nEdwards.

It shows that the most\nimportant body is the General\nMeeting of the Union, and it is\nhere that the members can voice\ntheir ideas and here that all major\npolicy decisions are made.\nThe management of the Union\nis done by Council, whose members will be mentioned later. They\ncarry out the wishes of the Union\nand see that it is running\nsmoothly. Council has a number\nof sub-committees which are responsible to Council and report\nto it at each meeting. Probably\nthe most important sub-commit-tee is the Executive consisting of\nthe President, his Deputy, the\nSecretary and the 3 Vice Presidents (Constituent College Presidents) which concerns itself With\ndomestic matters and mat^s of\ngreat urgency. It normally meets\nonce a week in term time. The\nmost vital committees to the club\nstructure of IC are the Athletic\nClubs, Social Clubs and Recreaional Clubs Committees. The\nobjects of each are to control the\nactivities of the clubs which constitute it, allocate money and the\nchairman represents its interests\non Council. ICWA's function is\nbest known to its members and is\nrepresented on Council by its\nPresident.\nEach constituent college is represented on Council by one member in addition to the President.\nThere are six Council members\nelected from the floor of the\nUnion. The purpose is to make\nsure that Council does not forget\nits ultimate responsibility to the\nLfnion and to represent in divi du als. In the near future they intend\nto keep office hours when anyone will be able to discuss Union\nmatters with them.

This position\nhowever, is being rectified.\nLAM LEY'S AM for your\u2014\ni BOOKS\nLC ART MATERIALS\nkv PAPER BACKS\ni \u00bb\nSTATIONERY\ne \u2022\ni! EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.7 "
