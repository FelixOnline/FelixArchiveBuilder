    "content": "HOCKEY I Steve Hutchings\nULU CUP FINAL\nLast Wednesday at Mot spur Park\nsaw the highlight of what was for IC\nHockey Club an otherwise poor season: the University of London Cup Final.\nWe arrived in good time for the\nstart, in spite of the coach driver taking what can only be described as\nthe 'scenic' route, to be greeted by\nabout twenty percent of Wye College,\nalong side which the small contingent\nof quiet, but confident, IC supporters\nseemed quite insignificant.\nThe match eventually started on\ntime, and all eyes were on the diminutive\nfigure of Poon Foke Loke, our'imported'\nMalaysian international, who with\nalmost his first touch of the ball place an\ninch-perfect pass through Wye defence\nto the left wing. This led to a cross that\nfound the veteran Bob Middleton totally\nfree at the top of the circle. With the goal\nat his mercy Bob mis hit the ball wide.\nMinutes later, however, following a long corner, Po on weaved his way\nthrough the defence and slotted the ball\ninto the net to open the scoring.\nThough controlling the centre of the\nfield IC were unable to capital is e on their\nearly lead, and were often troubled by\nsome speedy wing play which seemed to\nimpress the snoozing Daily Telegraph\nreporter.\nThe rest of the half produced no\ndangerous attacks by either side and the\nonly excitement was provided by the\nopposition's rowdy support and Shirley Coarse'swell ies. In the second half Wye College survived an early onslaught by the IC\nattack, before the game settled down\ninto its earlier pattern of IC midfield\ndomination, but with a lack of punch in\nthe attack. With less than fifteen minutes\nto go, Tony de Barr decided to wake\nup, which resulted in more effective\nfront running and a succession of\npenalty corners.\nBob Middleton was unlucky not to\nscore when, after a series of fouls by\nWye defenders at the top of the circle,\nhe beat the goalkeeper. But before he\ncould shoot into the empty goal the\numpire gave a short corner for the\nearlier infringements.\nUp till now IC's short corner routine\nhad been very disappointing, caused\nmainly by the absence of an effective\nhand-stopper, but Chris Ftielly's neat\nstick-stop and subsequent sidestep of\nthe oncoming defender left him a clear shot at goal which made the\nscore 2-0.\nMinutes later, in the dying moments\nof the match, Bob was up-ended in\nthe circle and Chris Rielly competently\nconverted the inevitable penalty flick,\nmaking the final score a deserved, but\nnot in press ive,30. After the match there was a little bit\nof subdued celebration during which\nPhil Webb inexplicably decided to take\noff his trousers in order to drink a yard in the Union Bar.\nTeam: G Corbin, I Crowe, R Davey,\nC Rielly, P Hughes, T de Barr (Capt),\nPoon Foke Loke, G Forbes, L Rich, R Middleton and J Afilaka.\nNeil Mason\nBOAT CLUB\nIn the second half of this term, the\nBoat Club has competed in several\nevents.\nThe first of these was the Henley IVs\nHead, where we entered four mens and two ladies' crews. None of the\nmens crews did as well as they could\nhave done, although three of them came in the first eleven. The girls'\ncrew finished third in their division.\nNext was Reading Head of the River\nRace, where three mens and one'\nladies VII Is were entered. The mens\nfirst VIII finished seventh overall, despite being hindered by slower boats starting in front of them. The second VIII finished equal eighteenth,\nonly nine seconds behind their class\nwinners, and although the novice VIII\nrowed well, they were no match for\nfitter school crews. The ladies probably\ndid better than the other IC crews,\nfinishing fourth in the ladies division,\nbehind two national squad crews and\nthe Oxford University Ladies VIII, and\nbeating the UL Ladies First VIII by\ntwenty-one seconds.\nLast Wednesday, 12th March, four\ncrews entered the University of\nLondon Head of the River Race, for\nUL colleges. In the absence of the\nmens first VIII, the IC second VIII won\nthe event outright, beating Kings College I into second place by twenty\nseconds. The mens novice VIII, rowing\nbetter on their home water, finished'\nfifteen seconds behind their division\nwinner. A University College crew,\nrumoured to be the UL VIII, withdrew\nfrom the ladies event at the last\nminute, possibly because of their defeat at Reading. This meant that IC I only had to beat IC II to win the Sir\nCecil Philips Plate, for the third successive time. Yet again IC proved\ntheir dominance of UL college rowing.\nOn Saturday, the ladies VIII competed\nin the Kingston Head of the River\nRace. The home crew's knowledge of\nthe course proved to be a decisive factor, with the Kingston ladies beating IC into second place by only\neight seconds, over a twenty two minute course.\nTomorrow, the men's first, second\nand novice VII Is are competing in one\nof the major events in the rowing calendar; the Head of the River Race\nfrom Mortlake to Putney. Four hundred\nand twenty crews, including the national squad and several overseas\ncrews, will be taking part, and IC hope\nto do as well as last year when they\nfinished sixteenth and thirty-first.\nCREWS First VIII: Steve Webb( Bow), Bill Bradbury, Miles Fellows, Tony Reynolds, Chris Geary, Richard Fearnhead,\nJohn Urry, Matt Pritchard( Stroke),\nSteve Crampton (Cox).\nSecond VIII: Bob Maddock s( Bow),\nSteve Collier, Paul Gerrard, Pete Moysey, Ed Hobhouse, Chris Adams,\nPete Allen, Tim Joslin (Stroke), Ian\nSimpson (Cox).\nNovice VIII: Pete Tebbutt (Bow), John Vedy, Keith Powell, Stuart All in son, Richard Redhead, John Marsden, John Hargraves, Mark Agnew (Stoke),\nMark Canven (Cox).\nLadies VIII: Liz Lindsay (Bow), Sara\nGray, Angela Burgess, Jo Pearson, Nonie Ray, Gwen Griffiths, Ann Toney,\nCatherine Weir (Stroke), Bill Partridge\n(Cox).\n11\n\n"

Dear Colin What surprised me most about last week's Union Meeting\nwas not that over a hundred of\nthe students present voted to\nsuspend a group of students\nfrom Union membership, but\nthat a similar number( and presumably, many not present)\ndid not care about what those\nindividuals were up to and why\nthe name of Imperial College was\nbeing soiled by their actions.\nFor those who were not there,\nlet me explain. An IC team are to\ntake part in sporting fixtures in a police state (which is where the\nMoscow analogy begins and ends) against teams selected\nfrom a racial minority, before\nracially segregated audiences.

    "content": "REVIEWS I THESE LECTER Hammersmith Palais\nThe Selecter package got to London on\nMonday amidst a welter of punks, skinheads and mods, all busy bopping\nfrantically away.\nFirst on were the Swinging Cats, who\nplayed a good solid set of sixties revamps\nwith an excellent swirl organ, very much\nto the fore, even if the rest of the band\nhad left their notes at home. The\nBodysnatchers, an all-female band, were\nmuch better; playing a wide range of\nreggae revival, but mainly their own\nmaterial including the single Ready,\nSteady, Go. Everyone was well warmed\nup by now and ready for the Selecter,\nwho were incredible.\nI have never seen a band so tight or so\nhot. Within minutes the whole crowd was\nleaping about, and two kids had been\nunceremoniously dumped by the bouncers.\nThey are a seven piece multi-racial outfit\nplaying what can best be described as\n'fusion music'. Whatever it is, it's great to\ndance to! The songs went through in\nrapid succession; Danger, Three Minute\nHero, Too Much Pressure, Street\nFeeling and It Makes Me Mad amongst\nothers. A lot of the songs are about racial\nand class tension, and the need for black,\nwhite, skin and punk to get together, stop\nfighting and have some fun. This worked\nwith most people, who were bopping\nthemselves stupid by this time, apart from\na small section of skinheads who chanted\nslogans now and then.\nThe band came on for three encores,\nincluding the obligatory On My Radio, a ska version of James Bone and a final\nversion of Madness with the Bodysnatchers\nRIFLE AND PISTOL CLUB\nAs is customary at |his time of year, the\nRifle Club organised three inter-CCU rifle\nand pistol competitions. The first, the full\nbore competition for the Jocelyn Thorpe\nCup was shot last Sunday at the NRA\ncamp Bisley. Two targets were shot at\nthree hundred and six hundred yards, with\nthe best five out of six to count, giving the\nmaximum possible team scores of 500.\nVisabiity was good, but a fresh, blustery\ncross-wind was blowing which caused at ew problems for the less experienced\nmembers of the teams.\nCity and Guilds won with the following\nresults.\nJOCELYN-THORPE CUP\n300yd s City and Guild*\nJ Evans (Capt) 45\nJ Bloomfield 50\n(Great Britain Squad)\n437.\nJ Marsden\nD Sleath\nJ Sackett\nA Pearce\nBest Five Total:\nRCS\nP Easterfield (Capt)\nA Jolleys\nA Briers\nP Dickson\nA Reeve\n46\n34\n41\n42\n47\n46\n43\n43\n46\nBest Five Total: 432.\nRSM\nE Christie (Capt) 41\nA Lewis 38\n600yd s46484040354433454241464030 back on stage to join in.

They sang,\naugmented by members of the choirs of\nMary Dafchelor Girls' School and Notting\nHill and Ealing High School, under the\nexperienced baton of Eric Brown, accompanied by a special orchestra with\nleaders John Bacon and Penelope Howard.\nThe change of venue (choir concerts are\nusually held in the Great Hall, Sherfield)\nwas agreeable, producing a magnificent\nsound, although the red brick and lights\nproduced something of a kiln effect for both\nperformers and audience.\nIn this superb work, the full emotion of the\nPassion came through, beginning with the\nrulers conspiring against Christ and\nfollowing the story until the burial of Jesus.\nThe soloists experienced difficulties in some\nparts of the performance, but on the whole\nthey did very well, and John Tudhope as the\nEvangelist gave a particularly memorable\nand excellent performance. ,\nI think regular attenders of choir concerts\nwould agree that, although this was perhaps\nnot technically the best concert they had\never given, it was however very moving and\nenjoyable. Partly due to the large size of the\nchoir, the entries were woolly and sometimes weak, but the fullness of the\nJ Atkinson\nC Darling\nJ Simpson\nH Cheetham\nBest Five Total:\n41\n46\n44\n41\n39\n44\n45\n42\n423.\nOn Wednesday afternoon the .22 prone\nrifle competition was shot for the Courtman\nShield, followed by the pistol competition\n(for which there is no trophy at present) in\nthe evening. Both competitions were held\nin the rifle range in the Sports Centre.\nThe Courtman Shield was the closest\ncompetition for years. Teams of six each\nshooting two cards with the best five to\ncount gave each team a maximum of 1,000\npoints. Each team shot very well with\nGuilds only beating Mines and RCS by\nthree and five points respectively. Unfortunately for Mines it is still not good\nenough to win their captain a pot in the\nUnion Bar (which requires them to win the\nCourtman Shield), . . . perhaps next year.\nThe Pistol was far less competitive with\nonly Mines and RCS with any sort of pistol\nshooters The teams shot 5 x2 cards with\nthe best four to count and the non-existant\ntrophy eventually going to Mines.\nThe final results were as follows.\nCOURTMAN SHIELD\nRSM\nE Christie (Capt)\nC Darling\nJ Atkinson\nJ Simpson\n192\n190\n183\n188\nTotal\n(Bast Flva)\n939\nsound they made during the choruses\nalmost made up for this.\nFor me, the most memorable and moving\npart of the performance was the beautiful\nchorale When I Am Close To Dying, which\nthe choir sang unaccompanied. This and the\nfinal chorus In Tears Of Grief made the\nwhole concert worthwhile.\nDespite it being a lengthy performance, it\nwas most enjoyable, and congratulations\nshould go to choir, soloists, orchestra and\nconductor for such a moving rendering.\nKaren Harget\nDRAM SOC Last week DRAM SOC put on a play, 'We\ncan't pay? We won't pay!' Ironically the plot\ncentred on a group of women who took\ngoods from a local supermarket. The\npublicity was based on the Waitrose bag\ndesign.

    "content": "Easter witnesses the greatest show on\nearth (well, nearly) in the form of drag\nracing (as seen on TV, although not very\noften). The venue being the in famous Santa Pod Raceway. Drag racing began\nvery humbly as cars racing between traffic lights in sunny Southern California\nand Florida. The guys got so fed up of\nbeing harassed by the police, that they\nbegan to use a disused airfield and things\nwent on from there.\nToday drag racing is a booming multi-million dollar business which is becoming\npopular worldwide, having active participation in at least ten countries. The sport\nis basically an acceleration contest, between two cars or bikes of about equal\nmodification over a standing start of\nquarter of a mile, the winner being the\none who crosses the finish first. Sounds\nsimple! Don't be fooled, a lot can happen\nin such a small distance, things can go\nseriously wrong, such as disintegration of\nclutch or engine, punctures, tyre shake\n(where the tyre only grips the track for\npart of a revolution), etc, etc. You don't have long to react before you hit a solid\nguard rail and that's when trouble really\nbegins, it doesn't do your health( or\noverdraft) too much good travelling at\nover 200mph upside down. However, that\ndoesn't happen too often.\nEvery year at least one Christmas\nTree gets demolished\nThe most important part of a drag race\nis the start, if you get off badly there's a lot of work to do to catchup. The starting mechanism being an electronic\nlight system( Christmas tree) the cars being placed between light beams, if you\nleave the line before the countdown is\nfinished you're disqualified. On a 'legal'\nstart a clock begins to count your time,\nand is terminated when you break a light\nbeam at the finish line. Your speed is also\nrecorded using, a further set of light\nbeams placed twenty feet apart. The clocks are very accurate, the closest race\nI 've seen was one of 0.0001 seconds separating the two cars. Most races are won\nby hund re th s of a second.\nThe cars and bikes are divided into\nclasses and sub-divided into sub-classes.\nThe 'Hot-N Juicy' Corvette Funny Car puts\na really smokey burnout at Indiannapolis\nin Before the actual run itself the cars go\nthrough a' burnout' process; the rear wheels are moved into pools of water,\nand the accelerator floored, spinning the\nrear wheels, melting the rubber and clearing the tyres. The layer of rubber\nwhich is laid down gives excellent traction\n(or grip) off the start line. To make use'of\nthis grip and the power available wide\nwheels and tyres are used; the tyres are\nmade useless after no more than three\nmiles racing. At the end of a good day's racing the track can have a good quarter\nof an inch of rubber covering the start\nline. At the end of a day the whole strip is\ncleared by heating and scraping to\nremove the rubber which cracks and spoils the surface.\nThe main classes:\nRocket Dragster/ Funny Car Light the blue touch paper and run, would\nbe an ideal comment, so I won't write it.\nThese cars are definitely exhibition cars, i.e. they are not allowed to race in pairs,\nbecause of the danger of a high speed\ncollision followed by possible detonation of\nthe Hydrogen Peroxide (neat) tanks. Topman is 'slamming' Sammy Miller of New Jersey in the Vanishing Point Rocket. His quickest run to date being 3.94 sees at 360\nm.p.h. over a standing quarter mile.

    "content": "The Mines Review\nReviewed\nWomen in Science and Technology( WIST) conducted a survey of people entering the Mines Review on Wednesday\n12th March from7:00 to 8:45 during which time186 people answered the\nquestions\nby\nWIST\nLess than half the entrants found out\nabout the review from the posters and most were not influenced by the type of\nposter which suggests that its offensive\nnature (a silhouette of a nude woman)\nwas totally unnecessary.\nA similar proportion, under fifty percent\nof those questioned would go to a strip\nshow outside of College and many suggested that the late bar licence influenced their decision to attend the\nreview rather than the type of entertainment offered.\nThe men did not accept that they were\nmaintaining a stereotype image of a' man'( nor reinforcing it) (question 6), however\nthe pack instinct was prevalent, with many people answering in groups; on the\nother hand many people entered, as\nstated above, for the bar.\nWe, in WIST, believe that strip shows\nhinder any moves towards equality in our\nuniversity society. To watch a show which displays women as objects to be\nlooked at and assessed in terms of their\nperformance, and then not to translate\nthese values in relations with other women on the same course, takes a conscious effort. The fact that so many\ngoing to the review saw the stripper as a woman can be seen as a worrying come nt on how they view women in general. Question 7, though, did provoke many to\nconsider the differences between their ideas of women and sex objects and, perhaps, highlighted some of the contra-diction s put forward in this society regarding sexual conditioning.\nYet another contradiction can be seen\nin the responses to question 8. relating to\nthe male stripper. Three quarters of those\nasked saw the male stripper as a clown.\nWe should next ask: Why is it that the\nmale stripper is a figure of ridicule and\nthe woman stripper not? Could it be to\ndo with' stereotypes', 'sex roles'? We suggest that one of the reasons female\nstrippers are 'exciting' is that a naked\nwoman is vulnerable and so the men in\nthe audience can derive a sense of power.\nA male stripper however does not depict\na helpless creatures. One only has to note that male nudity is often aggressive,\neg, in the cases of flashers and rapists.\nMines may say (and if they don't many\nothers will) that by having a male stripper\nthe event becomes non-sexist because\nthen women can look at a man, but this,\nagain, is just a case of men wanting women to conform to their ideas of\nsexuality.\nThis college has a very unequal ratio of\nmen to women and as previously stated,\nwe do not believe such spectacles as the\nMines Review will improve it. The results\nof the survey suggest that Mines should\nreview the need for this type of entertainment in College (on purely economic or\npopularity grounds if not egalitarian). Such events are not warranted (nor\ndesired) by people in this College and\nshould not continue.\nTo end on a slightly different (though\ntopical) note, the fear with which people\nregard I CW A organising women only events (which it does not do anyway) or\nevents pertaining specifically to women is\nalarming and yet with only eleven women out of 186 people entering the review, will\nMines be accused of providing discriminatory entertainment? Is this not just another contradiction highlighting inequality in this college( and another reason for keeping I CW A... or else to\ndisband Mines \u2014 let's be consistent at\nleast).\n5\n\n"

The apparent RCS cock-up at the start was only due to the fact\nthat the I CRag Committee, and indeed\nmost of those who attend Rag Committee\nmeetings, are RCS persons. Perhaps a point for our Guilds man elect chairman to\nbear in mind.\nSo we come to the travels of Deviant\ndoing it his way over eight hundred miles.\nEight hundred miles and Rolls Royces do\nnot make a hero of modern times. We showed the stuff which men are made is\nScotch, crisps and nearly one thousand\nmiles of continual travel.\nBesides, what did Deviant do when he\ngot to Perth? Nothing! He just turned\nround and headed home. The great long\ndistance RCS Rag machine left Dundee\nreeling under an onslaught upon their defenceless women in their university halls.\nBut what of the future?

    "content": "A HAPPY EASTER\nFROM FELIX\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION Friday 21st March 1980 Issue Number 549\nOPPOSITION TO BOAT CLUB TOUR\nOpposition is continuing against the Boat\nClub Tour. FELIX was in its final stages of\nproduction when further developments\noccurred. On this front we outline the\nbackground to the discussion and include a letter from the Imperial College Boat Club Captain, Steve Webb. An open letter\nwritten by the Anti-Apartheid Group at IC is\nprinted on page 2.\nAt last Thursday's Results U GMa motion\nwas discussed relating to the Boat Club tour\nof South Africa. The meeting turned into a heated discussion with two amendments\nbeing proposed to the original motion.\nHowever quorum was called before the vote\ncould be taken on the main motion.\nLast Tuesday an initial meeting of the\nAnti- Apartheid Group at Imperial College\ndiscussed the present situation of IC Boat\nClub rowing in South Africa. They decided\nthat the following action should be taken:\nThe Unions of colleges and universities\nwith major rowing clubs have been\ncontacted informing them of IC Boat Club's proposed trip and asking them to boycott\nfixtures with I CBC. All colleges and universities with Boat\nClubs are to be contacted asking them to\ndemand the withdrawal of I CBC from all\nrowing events.\nThe ARA( Amateur Rowing Association)\nis to be contacted, demanding the expulsion\nof I CBC the club would no longer be able to\nenter any events since all are ARA fixtures.\nIt was proposed to present a petition,\ncontaining the names of people opposed to\nI CBC rowing in South Africa to the ACC meeting held yesterday evening.\n75 TROLLEYS AT IC\nAs a result of a visit from the assistant Manager\nof Mssrs Waitrose Store on Friday 14th March\nsome 75 or more of their trolleys which were\nscattered around the college were collected and\nrestored to the company. There may be others\nstill on the campus and the Chief Security Officer,\nMr AD Dawson, has advised that it would be in\nthe interest of the college to publicise this matter\nwith a view of encouraging persons to return\nthem.\n(continued on back page)\nYesterday a meeting was organised by\nthe newly formed Anti-Apartheid Group at\nIC. The speaker was Sam Rams amy Chairman of the South African Non-Racial\nOlympic Committee ( SAN ROC).He spoke on the position of sport in South Africa and pointy ed out that racial\nintegration in sport in S. A. has only taken\nplace at an international level, not at club\nlevel. He said that this has been simply a result of S. African teams being expelled\nfrom international competition in many\nsports, which was damaging to the white\npopulation of S. Africa.\nAt the end of the meeting, a vote was\ntaken on the issuing of a press statement to\nthe student and national press, outlining the\nsituation, and calling for a boycott of\nImperial College Boat Club. This proposal\nwas accepted by the meeting.\nThose present included several members\nof IC Boat Club who had been invited to\nattend by the Anti-Apartheid Group. The letter from the IC Boat Club Captain, Steve Webb: I feel a lot has been said about the Boat\nClub. Tour to South Africa. So it is about\ntime the record was set straight, since the\nopponents seem to throw a lot of\nstatements and untruths around.\n1) The Boat Club was invited to South Africa purely due to its successes over the\nlast few years. Henley winners 1978, semi\nfinalists 1979 and Southern University\nwinners 1973-1980. It is a performance with\nwhich we at college should be jointly proud,\nhow often do you have the best college team\nin the country?\n2) It has been completely financed from\noutside sources with no College or Student\nUnion help whatsoever.\n3) None of the crew, to my knowledge,\nsupport in anyway the Apartheid policy of\nSouth Africa or any other regime.\n4) That in general, people do not approve\n(continued on page 3)\n\n"

    "content": "(from front page)\nBOAT CLUB of sport being used as a weapon for political\npurposes, as can be seen from the recent opinion polls, that 75% of people\nreject the call for an Olympic boycott, and the union policy is, at this moment in favour\nof all sporting contacts with all Nations,\ncolours and creeds.\n5) That the motion of the Anti-Apartheid\nGroup at Imperial College, has found 300\nodd signatures in several days which\namounts to about 6% of active students!!\nThis hardly seems to be a\" storm of\nprotests\" which Mary and her cronies have\nput on their Press release to the student\nNewspapers and a few Nationals!\n6) That all the channels for application\nwere gone thro' i.e. ACC Council UG Ms and there were no official changes of policy\nto instruct us not to go. Now after all has\nbeen arranged threats of retaliation are\nbeing voiced by an unofficial organisation\ncalling itself the Anti-Apartheid group at\nImperial College.\nIn conclusion I would like to appeal to all\nstudents at college (especially those of you who enjoy sport) to try and show the\nstudent politicians amongst us that we are\nnot prepared to be instructed what to do\nand who to play against but to leave the\ndecision up to the individuals who play the\ngame.\nI would also like to say that I went ahead\nwith this tour in the honest belief that it\nwould be a good thing for the college, and our sportsmen, in general, with no intention\never to show support for any Political\nSystem.\nEditorial comment - back page\nLATE\nNEWS\nACC MEETING( see front page)\nThe ACC meeting held last night closed\nafter only 2 minutes. Tim Hillyer deemed\nthat the meeting was in quo rate and so it\nended without any discussion on the Boat\nClub issue.\nC IN AP WP ELECTION EXPLOSION At 8:30 p.m. last night, there were 22\ncandidates standing for the six posts on\nthe Permanent Working Party. 17 were\nfully proposed and seconded. The election\nis by STV and it will be held at the U GM on\nThursday 24th April.\nMORE TROLLEYS TAKEN15 more trolleys were taken from\nImperial College and returned to\nWaitrose. This follows yesterdays\namnesty. It is reported that there could still\nbe another 20 trolleys on campus. FELIX\nhas had to use the Editor's wheelchair to\ndistribute today's copy of FELIX.\nCITY AND GUILDS A short article this week, just some\nnews about what Guilds have been doing\nduring the last week or so. In the haste to\nreport the elections a certain publicity\nofficer forgot to mention the events of the\nprevious weekend, so: The Election Rag\nhad about thirty people turning up to\ncollect outside Harrods in various styles\nof fancy dress. Guilds collected about \u00a3480 bringing our total to \u00a35,700. The Bar Night on Sunday was well attended and\nmany good pints were drunk as were a few yards by the candidates.\nNow on to the events of this weekend.\nThe theatre trip on Friday was a great\nsuccess with forty people going to see\nThe Accidental Death Of An Anarchist\nEverybody enjoyed the play and another\nsuch trip is planned. The East End trip on Sunday was a good time out for a few\nintrepid Guildspersons who remembered\nto set their clocks back an hour, our intrepid president got rather confused and\nmanaged to arrive an hour early. The trip\nthat followed showed this merry band some of the sights of the Near East End and was enjoyed by all who came.\nDon't forget to hand in your replies to\nthe Finn is ton Questionnaire that you should have all received. The reaction of\nus students is important, so get the replies into the Union Office today.\nHave a good vacation.\nCheers\nBryan\nURGENT MESSAGE TO HAM SOC MEMBERS\nThere is a HAM SOC meeting at 12:30 to-day, at the shack (roof of Elec Eng). They need help wi th the removal of equipment\nfrom their shack. It has to be dismantled\nbecause the roof of Elec Eng is being\nresurfaced over Easter because of leaks.\nC IN A Nick Jenkins\nIC STUDENTS LEAVE PETITION AT SOVIET EMBASSY A petition organized by the\nImperial College Union Jewish\nSociety, appealing to the Soviet\nauthorities to stop discrimination\nagainst Soviet students, collected over one thousand signatures. This was to be delivered to the Soviet Embassy.\nOn arriving at the Soviet Embassy the students representing the Jewish Society and the Union were admitted and engaged in a conversation with\nan Embassy official. He made\nthe point that they would not\naccept the petition as it dealt\nwith an internal Russian affair.\nAfter much argument the official stood firm in his stand\nagainst accepting the petition.\nWhilst two of the party engaged the official in obtaining\nthe address of the Russian Minister of the Interior a third\ndiscreetly 'left' the file containing\nthe petition. At this point all of\nthe students left.\nThus, though not accepted,\nthe protest was lodged on 'Russian soil'.\nThis protest was organised in\nconjunction with the nationally\norganised Students and Academic Campaign for Soviet Jewry.\nSPORTS CENTRE\nVAC CLOSURE The Sports centre will be closed between\n2nd and 10th of April.\n11 t f MINES v.

    "content": "Election day at Illogos College was\neven more bizzar e than usual. For when the tellers came to tot up the\nvotes cast for the post of Union President, they found to their surprise\nand bewilderment that many of the\nvoters had ignored the three names\non the ballot sheet, and had inscribed\nan extra one. Indeed, their perplexity\nincreased when it was realised that\nthis unknown nominee, whose name\nwas Mr Lampoon, had been elected\nto the presidential post.\nApparently, during the previous\nnight, some agent provo cat eur had plastered the walls of the college with\npropaganda in support of the mysterious\ncandidate. The seminal originality of\nthe art-work on these posters had\nbeen inspired; and it was for this\nreason alone that many of the voters\nhad pledged their alliance with Mr Lampoon in preference to his\nopponents, whose election propaganda\nhad been rancid with cant. Although\nthis was the general consensus of\nopinion, one girl said that it had\nbeen his French sounding name that\nhad appealed to her, while another\nfellow insisted that it had been Mr Lampoon's Marxist bent that had\nswung the election his way.\nAll the same, whatever the pitch of\nthe man's policies, it didn't help the\nunion executive to discover the 'true\nidentity or the whereabouts of this\nfictitious president-elect. For three\nhours after the result was known, a fierce debate ensued between the past\npresident, the returning officer and the chief teller. With their customary\nunanimity, each suggested a radically\ndifferent solution to their predicament.\nThen suddenly, when the whole\nelection seemed in grave danger of\nbeing reduced to the level of a comic farce, a deus ex machina\nappeared in the guise of at at til y dressed, unshaven fellow who just\nseemed to materialise out of the\nLondon smog.\nWith great gesticulations, he\nintroduced himself as Bruno, apologised\nfor being so late, then announced that he\nwas none other than Mr Lampoon's political agent. Mr Lampoon, he\nexplained, would not be available until\nthe following morning, when he,\nBruno, would gladly accompany the\nunion officers to meet him. He then\nrequested that they assemble outside\nthe gates of Whipsnade Zoo, since\nthis was in close proximity to\nLampoon's party HQ. The next morning, the three union\nofficers met up with the eccentric\nBruno, who arrived carrying a copy of the morning edition of the\nGrorniad, a bunch of ripe bananas\nand a can of anti-fly spray. Their\nconsternation over this was not\nallayed when Bruno bought four;\nentrance tickets to the zoo, yet this\nwas nothing in comparison to the\nshock that awaited them.\nBruno led them to the chimpanzee\ncage, doffed his cap to the hairy\nmale inside it, then, without the bat\nof an eyelid, handed him the\nnewspaper, the bananas and the anti-fly spray. \"This, gentleman,\" Bruno said, \"is Lampoon, your president-elect.\" The three union officers had\nsome difficulty digesting this morsel of\ninformation. They stood as if transfixed to\nthe ground, and stared stupidly at the\nanimal, who meanwhile had consumed\nthe eight bananas, and was busily\nsearching out the sports page in the\nnewspaper. Behind him, six or seven\nfemale chimps romped and loped around\nthe cage.\nThe man who received the brunt of\ntheir anger and confusion was, of course,\nBruno. How could Lampoon be president\nwhen he wasn't even a human, let alone a student, they cried. Bruno parried this\nobjection by presenting them with\nLampoon's student union card . . .\ncomplete with photograph and authentic\nstamp. Yet numerous other objections\nwere raised; how would the feminist\nmovement react when it became known that Lampoon had a dozen or so wives . .\n. . after all, to the Greer s of this world,\npolygamy is about as popular as celibacy\nin a bordello. Bruno, who disliked the\nsmell of prejudice, could see no\nconnection between a man's sexual\nappetite and his politics.\nAnyway, Bruno insisted that all these\nimpediments were illusory; Lampoon had\nwon the election, that was all that\nmattered. Besides, he was sure that\nLampoon's charismatic personality and\ninsouciant smile would carry all before\nhim.\nAfter several hours of disputation,\nBruno's eloquence and profound faith in\nhis prodigy had convinced the executive\nthat Lampoon's potential as a president\nwas unrivalled. Nevertheless, they\ndecided it would be prudent not to break\nthe news of Lampoon's identity to the\ncurious public until the next day, when an\nEG M would be arranged. Then the\npresident could be introduced in person,\nand a formal inauguration could take\nplace. At this point, Bruno indicated that\nLampoon's release was imminent . . . in fact, he had been carrying out a sociological study during his stay at\nWhipsnade, which had been completed.\nThus, the following day, Bruno led\nLampoon before an aghast audience of\nstudents. Of course, Lampoon realised\nthat he was the centre of attention, and with the dramatic sense of a woman, danced around the floor doing\nsummer sault s. Finally, to the fur ore of the\nassembled company, he demonstrated his\nincredible gymnastic abilities by swinging\nfrom chandelier to chandelier, and with\none enormous leap, landed in the\npresidential chair.\nBruno eventually managed to placate\nhis high spirits with the aid of a bunch of\nbananas. But the next problem arose\nwhen Lampoon was handed a fountain\npen with which he was to sign the\ninauguration document. This seemingly\nstraightforward task was made all the\nmore hazardous by Lampoon's mischievous insistence on squirting ink over\nthe union officers. Each time the pen\nejected a long silvery blue discharge of\nink, a roguish grin would spread across\nhis hairy face, and his open lips would\nreveal a set of dazzlingly white gnash ers BANANAS Now, these outrageous events occured\nover a week ago. During this time, all the\ndisputes, wrangles, points and counterpoints over Lampoon'shed gem ony have\nbeen dissipated by those two great\nredemptive features of any democratic\nsystem \u2014 apathy and resentment. While\nmost of the students have sunk back into\ntheir previous state of intemperance and debauchery, a few have begun to cast\naspersions on the new president. One particularly vitriolic attack was aimed at\nLampoon's policies and in the apparently\nhaphazard way in which they were\nformulated. In all honesty, it was being\nsaid that the president was more\nconcerned about the importation and exportation of peanuts and bananas than\nabout the welfare of his students.\nObviously, you will agree that such\nlibellous accusations are both unfounded\nand unjustified.\nNUTSHELL In addition, it was being claimed in\nsome circles that Lampoon's manifesto\nwas written on and hidden inside a nutshell, which he keeps hidden\nsomewhere about his person, and from\nwhich he occasionally takes a little nibble.\nDuring the past few days, Lampoon has\nbeen on a concentrated field study of the\nnearby Jekyll Park. Indeed, at this precise\nmoment in time, his exact whereabouts\nare not known. Some say that he's meditating in solitude on the world's problems, while other more skeptical\nobservers suggest that he's gali van ting about the grasslands like as and boy and practising some novel acrobatic trick with\nwhich to enrapture the next U GM.
