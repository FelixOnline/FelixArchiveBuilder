Photo: Telegraph\nGeorge Butcher considers why actually, everyone is just awful\n\u201cthey aren\u2019t\ngoing to win\nthe election\n\u2013 just maybe\nmake the\nothers a little\nbit less shit.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a clich\u00e9 that when we vote, we\ndo it with a peg over our nose and\ntry and chose the \u2018least bad\u2019 of all\nof them. Sadly this election seems to\nsuffer from a particularly bad dose.\nLet\u2019s start with the Conservatives.\nThey have led some of the most\nunfair policies, particularly for young\npeople. Pensioners have had tax\nexceptions and increased pensions\nwhilst young people pay for their\nown degrees, can no longer claim\nhousing welfare and still have a lower\nminimum wage. Food banks are the\nbiggest source of growth over the past\nfive years and no economist I\u2019ve read\nfrom has anything good to say about\nthe Conservative Party\u2019s economic\npolicies. They\u2019ve slashed the deficit\nwhen the government can borrow\nmoney at just 0.5% and given us an\nincredibly unproductive workforce.\nMeanwhile Labour has swung to\nthe left. Their response to a shortage\nof housing is to promise a rent cap,\nand capping energy prices and rail\nfares (pushing up prices before they\u2019re\neven in government). But despite all\nthis, they\u2019ve somehow convinced the\nScottish people that they\u2019re more\nright wing than Blair. Their ability\nto communicate is awful, and that\u2019s\nwhere Ed Miliband comes in. Can\nyou imagine him at a foreign summit\nwith Vladimir Putin? Negotiating\nover peace in the Middle East?\nCommunication and leadership does\nmatter if you want to make useful\nchanges and not just struggle through\na single term.\nSo who is remaining? The Green\nParty are more socialist than most\nof Labour \u2013 they want to stop\neconomic growth (literally) and\ngive everyone a \u201ccitizen\u2019s salary\u201d.\nOK \u2013 so they\u2019re a minority left wing\nparty, so what? The problem is that\nthey perpetuate the myth that you\nneed to be left wing to care about the\nenvironment \u2013 which is not only\nuntrue, but deeply damaging. The\nenvironment shouldn\u2019t just be for\nbeardy hippies \u2013 but for everyone.\nIt\u2019s the most important cause that has\nreceived almost zero coverage in the\ncampaigning this election, at least\npartly because it\u2019s associated with the\nsocialism of the greens.\nUKIP \u2013 I have very little to say.\nSuffice to say that the diversity and\nstrong individual culture you feel\nat Imperial is at least partly down to\nthe high numbers of international\nstudents. As for our relationship with\nEurope, I\u2019d much rather work with\nEurope to improve a union that has\nbrought peace to a continent that has\npreviously been characterised by war\nand turmoil.\nSo who is left? The Liberal\nDemocrats? Well that\u2019s how I voted,\nbut no doubt you have strong\nopinions about their apparent\nstruggle to keep to their promises on\npolicies such as tuition fees or their\nsupport of some unfair Conservative\npolicies \u2013 but that\u2019s a coalition for\nyou. However, they aren\u2019t going to\nwin the election \u2013 just maybe make\nthe others a little bit less shit.\n\u201cThe\nenvironment\nshouldnt just\nbe for beardy\nhippies\n\u2013 but for\neveryone\u201d\nWhy I am not voting in this election\nIt\u2019s easy, you put an X in the box. Photo: blogdailyherald.com\nAnonymous: can\u2019t wait until all these arguments are over\nHonestly, the short answer is,\nI no longer care. It feels like\nmonths since every single\npolitician decided that doing the\njob they are paid for (running the\ncountry) was too much effort, and\ndecided to tell us why exactly they are\nthe best at doing the job they\u2019re not\nactually doing. If it was for a couple\nof weeks, or maybe a month, I would\nprobably care enough to listen to\nwhat everyone said but when it goes\non for this long, I just give up.\nSocial media is more of a thing\nthat ever before, which has led to\nan over-saturation of all things\npolitical. When I\u2019m on YouTube,\nI want to watch silly videos, not\nsee David Cameron advertising\nthe Conservatives. When I\u2019m on\nFacebook, I want to keep up with\nwhat my friends are doing, not have\nmy entire newsfeed full of arguments\nbetween people who are unlikely to\nchange their political opinions after\nlooking at a couple of pictures full of\ncherry picked policies. I don\u2019t have\nTwitter, but I\u2019m somehow still aware\nof all the election related things going\non there too. Yes, some of them are\namusing, but all of it adds up.\nThe fact that I\u2019m registered to vote\nat my parents house doesn\u2019t help\neither. Travelling home just to vote is\nway too much effort, and as I\u2019m only\ngoing to be living in my constituency\nin London for a few more months, I\ndon\u2019t see much point in voting there\neither.\nI might be more likely to vote if\nit wasn\u2019t for the fact that honestly,\nI don\u2019t feel like my vote counts for\nmuch. There is no perfect way to\nhave democracy, but the first past\nthe post system feels like a way\nto increase apathy, not decrease\nit. Both of the places I could have\nvoted have historically had pretty\ncomfortable majorities for their\nrespective parties, so my single vote\nwould have basically no impact,\nespecially as if I had voted, I would\nhave just spoiled my ballot paper\nanyway. Even in places without those\nmajorities, I\u2019m not sure if anywhere\nhas ever had a general election come\ndown to one vote (and if I\u2019m wrong\nabout this, feel free to correct me).\nThough in practice it might not be\nany better, at least with proportional\nrepresentation my vote directly\nmeans something.\nYes, I probably should have voted,\nyes I might well regret not voting\nat some point in the next five years.\nBut truthfully right now I just don\u2019t\nwant to think about it any more.\nThe newspaper coverage, the social\nmedia presence, the never-ending\nconversations all just make me want\nto crawl into a hole and wait for it all\nto be over.\nAfter tonight it will all be over.\nAnd I can\u2019t wait.\nGEORGE BUTCHER\nCOMMENT WRITER\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel\nlike my vote\ncounts for\nmuch\u201d\n\u201cthe first\npast the post\nsystem feels\nlike a way\nto increase\napathy, not\ndecrease it.\u201d\n\n"

The\ngeneral election has been exciting\nto follow, if not for pure online\nhilarity if nothing else. The rise of the\nmilifandom has shown that if you put\nyour mind to it, anything can become\na viral sensation if you photoshop\nhard enough.\nThe general election itself,\neven with its faults, is still a great\ndemonstration of democracy, and\nindeed is something we should be\nproud of. However, what really\nhas impressed me is the online\nengagement this general election\nhas managed to invoke, something\nthat was not really present in the last\ngeneral election back in 2010.\nThis engagement has been\nparticularly strong in the younger\ngeneration, the one that often is\nassociated with political apathy.\nThe last general election took\nplace whilst social media was still\nin its infancy, but now we are able\nto share our feelings and thoughts\nat a moment\u2019s notice and join with\nmillions of more people doing the\nsame.\nThe rise of social media and the part\nwe have played as a young generation\ncan in fact have rippling effects across\nthe rest of the voting demographic.\nThe magnitude of one vote in the\ngrand scheme of things may not shift\na seat (if I am wrong though, I will\nbuy you a drink tomorrow night), but\nthe magnitude of one idea, one tweet\nand one hashtag can change the game\nentirely.\nVarious hashtags\nincluding #getcameronout,\n#DogsAtPollingStations, #JeSuisEd\nand of course, the #milifandom have\ntrended sat some point or another,\nand they show how the discourse\nsurrounding the elections has not just\nevolved, but become truly impressive\nand swelled in size.\nAnd they all started with just one\npost.\nThe ideas we\u2019ve shared online can\ninfluence the views of others and it is\nthis power social media has that can\ntranslate into shifts of opinion, shifts\nin voting and maybe even complete\nshifts in parliament as a result.\nTrends on twitter blend and bleeds\ninto the press, and this in turn leaks\ninto the rest of the population.\nAlthough we may have voted in\nisolation, our participation as a\nyoung generation in this election\nhas been far from it. Let\u2019s hope\nthat we therefore have influenced a\ngovernment that in the future will\nrepresent us a bit better in the future,\nor at the least made the rest of the\ncountry realise we are at least a force\nto be reckoned with.\nTHIS WEEK\u2019S EDITORIAL\nIs the tweet mightier\nthan the vote?\nContents\nNews 3\u20137\nComment 8\u201310\nScience 11\nPolitics 12-13\nScience 12\u201314\nPolitics 11\u201313\nMusic 14-15\nTravel 16-17\nFilm 20\nWelfare 23\nArts 24\u201330\nTravel 37\nFilm 32\nHangman 33\u201336\nPuzzles 37\u201338\nSport 39\nFelix, Offices\nBeit Quad, Prince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7 2BB\nEmail: felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTel: 020 7594 8072\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nPrinted by Iliffee Print Cambridge, Winship\nRoad, Cambridge.\nRegistered newspaper ISSN 1040-0711\nCopyright \u00a9 Felix\nFront page picture: SWC\nThere is still time to get\ninvolved!\nEmail felix @imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Photo: aajkikhabar.com\nNefeli Maria Skoufou Papoutsaki looks at the effect bacteria in our\ndigestive systems could have on our health\n\"Bacteria\nmake up\n90% of the\ncells in our\nbodies.\"\nThe human body contains\na vast number of bacteria,\nthe majority of which are\nbeneficial to us. Some of them help\nin the production of vitamins while\nothers help in the digestion of food.\nThis community of microbes, called\nthe microbiome, constitutes 90% of\nthe cells in our body. Recent research\nhas shown that the makeup of this\ncommunity in our digestive systems\ncan affect our metabolism and body\nweight and is sometimes linked to\nobesity.\nVariation in the abundances of\ndifferent species of gut bacteria\nis closely linked with lifestyle or\nenvironmental factors. But a recent\nstudy showed that this variation\nmay also be heritable. The group at\nKing\u2019s College London compared the\nmicrobiome of identical twins, who\nshare 100% of their genome, with that\nof non-identical twins, who share on\naverage half of their genes.\nThey found that identical twins\nhave more similar microbiomes\nthan non-identical twins, suggesting\nthere is also a genetic factor in its\ncomposition.\nHowever, the most interesting part\nabout the microbiome is the potential\neffect it may have on our eating\nhabits. Bacteria benefit from living\ninside humans just as humans benefit\nfrom the bacteria in our digestive\nsystems. But it could sometimes be in\nthe bacteria\u2019s interest to manipulate\nthe behavior of their host to improve\nthe nutrients they receive. This can\nbe to our expense, if this is food with\nmany carbohydrates and fat since it\nmay cause obesity and other health\nproblems.\nBut how could bacteria manipulate\nour behavior? In the absence of some\nlimiting nutrients bacteria produce\ntoxins, which might induce a negative\nmood to lead humans to eat more.\nThey could also alter our senses so\nthat we like what is beneficial for\nthem.\nRecent studies have linked the\ninconsolable crying of infant colic\nwith changes in gut microbiota. The\ntendency of parents when their baby\ncries is to feed them so Colic may\nincrease the resource delivery to the\ngut and hence microbial access to\nnutrients. This may be the reason\nwhy increase in weight is observed\nafter colic.\nIf we gain a more complete\nunderstanding of the microbiome\nand its effect on us we may be able\nto reduce the cases of obesity or\nother diseases linked with increased\nconsumption of food.\nFor example, microbiota\ncommunity structure changes\ndrastically within 24 hours of\nchanging diet or administration of\nantibiotics.\nAnother way to resolve this\nissue may be to inhibit a cell-to-cell communication system of gut\nbacteria, called quorum, since this\nmay be a way in which bacteria\ncoordinate to manipulate our eating\nbehaviours.\nAlso, administration of prebiotics,\nnon-digestable compounds that\nstimulate the production of beneficial\nmicrobes, has been linked with weight\nloss in many studies, especially in the\ncase of prebiotic yoghurt.\nThe link between gut bacteria\nand obesity remains poorly\nunderstood, however, and many other\nfactors, such as lack of willpower,\nenvironmental mismatch and\nnutrient shortages, may be more\nimportant. However, these factors\non their own may not be enough to\nexplain unhealthy eating.\nThis area of research has caught the\nattention of many scientists who are\ninitiating projects that can generate\nmore solutions to the issue of the\nmicrobiome and its link with obesity\nand other diseases.\nThe British Gut Project, for\nexample, has been funded, in open\ncollaboration with the Department\nof Twin Research at King\u2019s College\nLondon and the American Gut\nProject, in order to understand the\nbacterial diversity of the British Gut.\n\"The link\nbetween\ngut bacteria\nand obesity\nremains\npoorly\nunderstood.\"\nIn a galaxy far, far away...\nThis blue smudge is the most distant galaxy\never discovered.\nEGS-zs8-1,as it\u2019s formally known,is a\nstaggering 13.1 billion light years away from\nthe earth. It\u2019s also one of the oldest ever\nobserved,having formed just a few hundred\nmillion years after the big bang.\nThe team behind the discovery,published\nin AstrophysicalJournalLetters,used NASA\u2019s\nHubble space telscope to identify the galaxy,\nand measured how far away it is with data\nfrom the Keck observatory in Hawaii.\nAccurately measuring distances in\ncosmology is surprisingly tricky,as it\u2019s often\ndificult to tell the difference between\ngalaxies that are dim and neaby and ones\nthat are bright and far away.\nThe distance to this new galaxy was\ndetermined from the spectrum of light\nit emits. Because of the expansion of the\nuniverse,more distant galaxies are moving\naway from the earth faster than those close\nby. This causes the light they emit to be\nshifted towards the red end of the spectrum\ndue to the Doppler effect.\nAccording to Pascal Oesch,a postdoctoral\nresearcher at Yale and lead author of the new\nstudy:\u201cwe have a lot of sources that we can\nsee with Hubble that are probably farther\naway,but we cannot measure their exact\ndistance yet.\u201d\nThe discovery gives us an important\nglimpse of galaxy formation in the very early\nuniverse.When the light we see now irst left\nEGS-zs8-1,it was already around 15% of the\nsize of the Milky Way is now,and growing\naround 80 times more rapidly.\nThe properties of these early galaxies are\nvery different to those we see today,and they\nraise important questions for cosmologists\nlooking to understand the early universe.\nJAMES BEZER\nImage credit: NASA\n\n"

The\ngood news is that the cassette player\nstill works, so during the many\nhours ahead my dad will be working\nthrough the mighty collection of\nmusic tapes from his University\ndays. I am to be exposed to literally\nhundreds of hours of \u201880s music.\nOh well, at least the car is in a\nfetching blue-green colour.\nWe Are Alone\nNo back-up support. If we break\ndown, we have to find a way to fix\nthe problem. We choose the route\nourselves, and are responsible for the\nvisas involved.\nAs we will be lucky to reach the\nfinish point without half a dozen\nbreak downs, if at all, preparation for\nfuture repairs and problems is key.\nOur gear includes many interesting-looking tools of various sizes, as well\nas shovels (for sand) and two sturdy\nmetal planks (for ditches). On the\nbright side, when we break down in\nthe middle of nowhere, the car is very\nlight compared to modern ones. We\nshould be able to push.\nWe are planning to go through\nFrance, Germany, and Poland,\nbefore heading diagonally south,\nto eventually enter Russia via\nnorthern Ukraine. We then will head\nfully south and turn East through\nKazakhstan. Crossing into Mongolia\nitself involves a brief hop back into\nRussia, before heading straight to\nUlaanbaatar. For some reason the\nfinish line this year has moved from\nMongolia\u2019s capital to Ulan-Ude in\nSiberia, but my family has had a\nlong-running joke that one day I shall\nroller-skate in Ulaanbaatar, and it\nwould be a shame not to complete the\nchallenge.\nRoller skates re-packed, we will\nhead north back into Russia for\nthe final time in order to get to\nUlan-Ude. This multiple re-entry\ninto Russia has caused some\ncomplications with the visas needed,\nas a normal tourist visa only allows\ntwo entries.\nHowever, after some research,\nwe found a more expensive version\nwhich will suit our needs. An\ninteresting challenge posed by the\nfreedom of route is the lack of maps\navailable for some regions. In a world\nof Google Maps and satellite imaging,\nit was surprising to discover that no\nactual road maps have been updated\nin some areas for over a decade.\nThere is something a little deflating\nabout having THE most up-to-date\nmap out there and finding out that\nyou were still in primary school\nwhen it was published. As we are\nguaranteed to get lost at least\nonce, I am considering learning\nsome rudiments of various Asian\nlanguages, should wild gesticulating\nand a look of abject confusion fail to\nexplain our predicament to locals.\nHelping the World\nThis year the Adventurists are\nsupporting Cool Earth. Every team\nis raising \u00a31000 for one of their\nprojects. The one that I chose was\nto support the Awuj\u00fan project. The\nAwaj\u00fan people live in Peru, close to\nthe Ecuadorian border. Cool Earth\nwishes to protect 56,000 acres of their\nland, home to 15 endangered species,\nfrom the threat of loggers and of\nminers.\nAs well as the environmental\nimpact of deforestation, destroying\nAwaj\u00fan land would push these\nspecies closer to extinction and\ndestroy the local people\u2019s way of life.\nHopefully the Citroen will be able to avoid this fate. Photo: Creative Commons\nThe fetching blue-green 26 year old Citroen AX that will travel across the world. Photo: Amelie Lecoeuche\nCool Earth works by helping the\nlocal people to protect their homes.\nBy developing alternative sources of\nincome through fish farms, cacao,\nand traditional jewellery made from\nseeds harvested from the rainforest,\nthe idea is to out-price forest\ndestruction. By helping the people to\nretain control of their homes,\nCool Earth also protects vast areas\nof forest which cannot be accessed\nwithout first clearing the area\nbelonging to the villages. In effect,\nthe villages and the forest close to\nthem create a barrier to prevent\nfurther deforestation.\nSo the plan is to drive across most\nof two continents in an old and\nunreliable car using a route which\nmay have changed and the roads may\nactually break the car in order to save\nthe homes of hundreds of people\nthousands of miles away.\n\u2018What are you doing this summer?\u2019\nI\u2019m saving the world.\nDonations can be made in person or\nvia the Cool Earth platform at www.\ncoolearth.org/402/driving-to-save-the-planet, and I have set up a Facebook\npage to document our travels (search\n\u2018Driving to Save the Planet\u2019).\nFor more information, visit www.\ncoolearth.org and http://www.\ntheadventurists.com/mongol-rally\n\n"

It has turned into a special\ncircle of hell with the smell of\nstress oozing out of the walls and\nthe room echoing with the sound\nof a thousand people scribbling.\nHurricanes of paper raged on every\ntable so I found nowhere to sit. I\u2019m\nquite relieved really. It gave me an\nexcuse to escape the place and find\nsomewhere else.\nI\u2019ve talked lots and lots about exam\nstress in my previous articles but I\u2019ll\nwrite one more just because of the\nsheer stress I\u2019ve seen today. This time,\nI\u2019ll go for something very precise.\nNo more general tips and analyses,\n\u2018maybe-this, maybe-that\u2019. They aren\u2019t\nvery useful in the thick of action\nwhen emotions run high and nerves\nare on edge. I\u2019m going to give you a\nschedule, and let\u2019s call it an Exam\nSurvival Guide.\nSome of the advice will make you\ngo \u201cI know, dad/mum!\u201d if you hear\nthem back at home. But please trust\nme for a minute and read the rest of\nthe article. This seemingly simple\nsurvival guide has helped me through\none of the most stressful times of my\nlife: three weeks before my finals in\nmy undergrad (one of the two graded\nexam sessions in my whole degree).\nMy alternative had been anxiety pills.\nThis routine was actually given to\nme by a university doctor I had an\nappointment with during my finals\nrevision. He said I should strictly\nstick to the schedule for a week and if\nthings aren\u2019t getting better, he would\nprescribe anxiety pills.\nBefore the schedule, I had been\nsleeping at 03:00 or 04:00, waking\nup at 10:00, somehow still feeling\nhorrible. I wasn\u2019t able to work\nproperly until 15:00 because of\nheadache, then trying to compensate\nfor time badly spent by working\nfurther into the night, I went to bed\nlater and later. The vicious cycle got\nworse, until I couldn\u2019t focus anymore.\nSo I gladly accepted this routine. I\nthink it was out of lack of alternative;\nI knew that my night routine wasn\u2019t\nworking even though I\u2019ve always been\na night owl, so a recommendation\nthat sounded different and stable is\nwelcome.\nI first thought the \u2018doctor\u2019s\norders\u2019 would put extra weight on\nmy shoulders. But after a few days,\nthe routine became a massive relief\nbecause it made me feel that there\nwas something I could finally control.\nI knew what each of my days would\nlook like and despite the exams,\nthings weren\u2019t as chaotic anymore. It\ndoesn\u2019t make exams easier, just easier\nto cope with.\nLooking back at it, the Exam\nSurvival Guide is actually an effective\ntime management system.

Image: Wayne Fears\nEXAM SURVIVAL GUIDE SCHEDULE\n08:00-09:00\u2013Wake Up,Morning Routines,Breakfast\nHave an easy breakfast that packs a lot of slow-release energy.Porridge,\nwhole-grain cereal or congee recommended.Do not skip it.This will be\nyour energy source until lunch and the gradual digestion will keep you\nawake as you study.It will also start your metabolism,which helps stabilize\nyour blood sugar level that will in turn reduce stress.\n09:00-12:00\u2013Revision\nTry to keep the revision within this time frame,but make sure you use all\nthe time wisely.\n12:00-13:00\u2013Lunch Break\nAnything is great for lunch apart from two things: Heavy meal and\nsugary lunch.Heavy meal will give you a food coma that will knock you\nout in the afternoon session.Doughnuts for lunch might seem like a great\nidea but the sugar high and the eventual crash will make your afternoon\nrevision a hell of a rollercoaster.\n13:00-16:00\u2013Revision\nThe challenge here is staying awake (I would know),especially when\nyou\u2019re not used to this kind of schedule.Light caffeine and healthy lunch\nwill deinitely help with this.\n16:00-16:30pm\u2013Coffee/Tea/Biscuits/Socialising/Gaming Break\nTo refuel some energy or blow off some steam.Breaks are essential for\nthe daily marathon.But make sure that you don\u2019t talk to friends past 16:30!\n16:30-19:00 \u2013Revision\nThe last push to complete all the revision you\u2019ve set yourself for the day.\n19:00-20:00\u2013Dinner\nNow it\u2019s time to reward yourself for 8 hours of revision you\u2019ve done today.\nPreferably ice cream for dessert.Diet can come later.\n20:00-22:00\u2013Rest (Or Optional Revision)\nCan be an optional revision session in the case that there is still a lot of\nmaterial to cover,or you\u2019ve procrastinated too much during the day.\n22:00-00:00\u2013Rest\nThis is vital.It can be exercise,talking to friends,gaming,silly youtube\nvideos or just doing nothing.I would recommend exercise as it uses up the\nadrenaline stored up in times of stress,but whatever to take your mind\noff the stuff you\u2019ve revised today.The brain takes a while to consolidate\nlong-term memories and this is an unconscious process,so just trust your\nbiology to do what it\u2019s supposed to do.Plus,your brain needs some time to\ncalm down from intense mental activity so you can go to sleep more easily.\n00:00\u2013Sleep\nTry to stick to midnight because if it gets any later,you\u2019ll either wake up\nwith less sleep or the whole routine might slowly begin to shift.Memory\nconsolidation also occurs during sleep,so getting enough sleep during\nthe exam season is essential.It also makes waking up at 08:00 more of a\npossibility for night owls.\n\n"

I loved having the\nopportunity to take part\nBroaden your education. Enhance your potential\nOn-line enrolment is open\nfrom Wednesday 6 May until\nFriday 26 June 2015 for current\nundergraduates entering their 2nd,\n3rd and 4th years in October 2015\nLib Dems will deliver a fair society\nOne of the biggest things\nI\u2019ve noticed as secretary of\nthe newly formed Liberal\nDemocrat Society this year is that\nstudents have very mixed and\noften strong opinions of the Liberal\nDemocrats. I\u2019m hoping to shine a\nlight on why I voted for the Liberal\nDemocrats on 7th\nMay.\nIt would be silly not to address\ntuition fees first. Despite the\ncontroversy, I genuinely believe that\nno Liberal Democrat in Parliament\nwanted to support the Tories in\nraising tuition fees. Despite this,\nthey fought hard to get the best deal\npossible for students, introducing\na progressive loan system that has\nresulted in graduates actually paying\nless per month than they would have\nbefore.\nThe mood among the party and\nits supporters is that the coalition\nhas been a success thanks to the\nLib Dems; they had the chance to\npass legislation directly from their\nmanifesto and also fought tooth and\nnail to block some of the Tories\u2019 crazy\npolicies. The Liberal Democrats have\nachieved all of these remarkable\nthings despite winning less than 9%\nof the seats in Parliament, something\nno smaller party has achieved in\nrecent history.\nIn this election, the Liberal\nDemocrats put forward a manifesto\nthat I think was the best of the lot.\nIt put a strong emphasis on mental\nhealth, something close to many\nstudents\u2019 hearts. They promised to\ndeliver equal treatment of mental\nand physical health in the NHS. In\nthe last Parliament the NHS budget\nincreased in real terms every year and\nNick Clegg has promised to deliver\nthe extra \u00a38 billion a year England\u2019s\nNHS needs, according to the Chief\nExecutive of NHS England.\nOn Education, the Lib Dems have\ndone great work, and Nick Clegg has\npledged to protect the education\nbudget from nursery to 19, with\nthe ambition of eradicating child\nilliteracy in the United Kingdom by\n2025.\nThe Lib Dems also want to shift\ntax away from work and towards\nunearned wealth, to allow workers\nto keep more of what they earn and\ncreate a more equal society. The\nLiberal Democrats also want to\nintroduce a mansion tax and clamp\ndown on tax avoidance in the next\nfive years.\nFreedom and equality is also\nhigh up on the Lib Dem agenda. In\nthe last government they blocked\nthe Tory \u2018Snooper\u2019s Charter\u2019 which\nthreatened online privacy, and want\nto take this further in the next one by\nintroducing a Digital Bill of Rights\nto safeguard people\u2019s privacy online.\nThey also plan to tackle homophobic\nand transphobic bullying in schools\nand professional sports, force\ncompanies to publish the salary\ndisparity between men and women,\nand employ more Black, Asian and\nMinority Ethnic police officers.\nBy time you\u2019re reading this, the\nvotes will have been counted and\nchances are coalition discussions are\ntaking/have taken place. The Liberal\nDemocrats have proven themselves to\nbe a strong, sensible coalition partner\nand plan on being one again in the\nnext government. They won\u2019t let\nLabour borrow too much, and they\nwon\u2019t let the Tories cut too much; as\nNick Clegg put it, \u201cWe\u2019d give a heart\nto a Tory government and a brain to\na Labour one\u201d. Last week Nick Clegg\nannounced that the Lib Dems will not\nenter coalition with Labour or the\nConservatives unless they promise\nto increase education funding and to\nintroduce a stability budget within\n50 days of forming a government to\nbalance the books fairly and quickly.\nWith the recent rise of smaller\nJamie Thomas believes in the achievements of the minority party\nparties from both ends of the political\nspectrum, the Lib Dems are the\nonly party committed to keeping\nthe country firmly and sensibly in\nthe centre. They are the party most\ncommitted to building a stronger\neconomy and a fairer society; this is\nwhy I voted Lib Dem on the 7th\nMay.\nOr what may be chicken? Photo:\nDaily Mail\n\n"

    "content": "26 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n08.05.2015\nArts Editors Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Extraordinary Tale of Everyman\nFor British actor Chiwetel\nEjiofor, no role is too\nlarge. Coming to national\nprominence after his showstopping\nturn in Othello in 2008, for which he\nwon the Olivier Award for Best Actor,\nhe returns to the UK this year with\na spade of awards and nominations\nunder his belt thanks to his stirring\nperformance as Solomon Northup\nin the 2013 Steve McQueen film 12\nYears A Slave, which nabbed the top\nspot of numerous critics\u2019 end of year\nlists. However, if any role is to give\nhim pause it would be his latest one;\nEjiofor is the titular character in\nthe National Theatre\u2019s production\nof Everyman, taking on the mantle\nof humanity. Rufus Norris\u2019 first\ndirectorial effort as head of the\nNational Theatre, Everyman is a\nmixed bag, with strong performances\nand excellent physicality coming\nup against a lackluster script, whose\nelements jar in all the wrong places.\nA 15th\nCentury morality play,\nEveryman follows the proverbial\njourney of the \u2018Everyman\u2019, a\nparadigm of humanity, who\nundertakes a quest for Christian\nredemption. Following his death, he\nis judged by God, his deeds tallied\nup and weighed; he tries to find\npeople to accompany him on this\njourney, turning first to an ensemble\nrepresenting fellowship, then his\nkindred, and finally to material\ngoods, before facing that he must\ngo it alone. Ultimately, he looks\ninside himself, finding an inner\nknowledge of mankind\u2019s innate\ngoodness that will accompany him\ntowards judgement. Paying penance\nin front of God, Everyman begs for\nforgiveness, and is finally absolved.\nOf course, Norris felt that bringing\nalong only one big name was not\nenough; this is his first production\nafter all, and there\u2019s no better\nimpression than a play buckling\nunder the weight of household\nnames. Therefore, he has invited\nCarol Ann Duffy, Poet Laureate, to\ntranscribe the script of Everyman,\nupdating its vernacular from Old\nEnglish to modern slang, and thereby\n\u2013 theoretically \u2013 making it more\naccessible to today\u2019s audience. Maybe\nNorris felt that he should appeal to\nthe broadest range of people possible,\nor perhaps he thought that a couple\nof swear words here and there would\nbe better than innumerable instances\nof the word \u201cthy\u201d, but really he does\nthe play, and the public, a disservice.\nDuffy\u2019s adaptation is adequate,\nbut there are moments where the\ncolloquial language comes against\nthe grand themes, stuttering and\ngrinding like a spanner in the works.\nHaving Everyman accuse his sister of\nbeing a bitch, or calling Death a cunt,\nsimply detracts from the grandiose\nthemes, bringing us down to earth\nwith a dull thud.\nFurthermore, Duffy takes away\nmuch of the religious aspect; a\ngamble that doesn\u2019t quite pay off, it\nmeans that the heavy subject matter\ninstead becomes a wry indictment\nof modern consumerism (I mean,\nI hate capitalism as much as the\nnext bourgeois culture vulture,\nbut the same thing has been\ndone \u2013 and better \u2013 by numerous\nplaywrights). However, some aspects\nof modernisation do work; Duffy\nreplaces the theme of mankind\nabusing each other, and focusses on\nhow we damage the environment.\nWhirling montages of natural\ndisasters and floods roll through the\nauditorium like a hurricane, provided\nby video designer Tal Rosner. It serves\nas the dramatic apex of a production\nwith a heavy focus on clever staging;\nfrom the very beginning, where\nEjiofor is slowly lowered down on a\nrope, through the scenes where he\nconfronts his own materialism in a\nsubconscious department store, and\nup to this gripping conclusion, Ian\nMacNeil\u2019s setting rarely puts a foot\nwrong.\nJavier De Frutos\u2019 work as\nchoreographer and movement\ndirector should also be applauded,\nproviding the ensemble cast with a\nnear-aggressive sense of physicality.\nBut the real draw, the one that will\nbring the crowds in and ensure that\nthe production has a sell-out run,\nis the presence of Ejiofor. And fair\nenough. Ejiofor is nothing short of\nmagnificent. With sweat dripping\noff his brow, he cowers in the face\nof death, delivering his lines with\na great might. With a gravitas that\nonly those most brilliant actors\ncan possess, he brings the entire\naudience to a standstill, as we bath\nin his magnificent oratory. He is not\nencumbered by the awkwardness of\nthe language, managing to transcend\neven the most awkward turns of\nphrase; that being said, it makes\nme sad that we aren\u2019t seeing him\ndeliver the original text. We\u2019ve seen\nthis man deliver one of the finest\nShakespearean performances of the\nmodern age \u2013 imagine what he could\nhave done with the unaltered play.\nThe remainder of the cast are just as\nexcellent, although, naturally, none\novershadow the main attraction.\nKate Duch\u00eane\u2019s God is a world-weary\ncleaning lady, sweeping up after\nthe mess her humanity has created,\ntired at the long years the human\nrace has put morality in the corner;\nDermot Crowley imbues his Death\nwith a scottish brogue, replacing the\ntraditional black cloak and scythe\nfor protective overalls and gloves,\nresembling more a cast member of\nCSI than the bringer of doom.\nUltimately, Everyman is an\nextremely promising opener to\nRichard Norris\u2019 tenure at the helm\nof the country\u2019s most famous\ntheatre. With its explosive set\ndesign, energetic movement, and\npowerhouse of a central performance\nfrom Chiwetel Ejiofor, Everyman is\nan engaging piece, and bodes well\nfor Norris\u2019 run. Despite a script that\ndoesn\u2019t live up to what could have\nbeen, I am certain that Everyman,\nwith its lively, dazzling take on what\nit means to be human, will prove a\ntriumph.\nEveryman is on at the National\nTheatre until 30th\nAugust. Tickets from\n\u00a315, available online.\nChiwetel Ejiofor as Everyman and Kate Duch\u00eane as God in the National Theatre\u2019s production of Everyman Photo: Richard Hubert Smith\nChiwetel Ejiofor astonishes Fred Fyles at the National Theatre\n\n"

    "content": "12 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n08.05.2015\nPolitics Editor Joshua Renken\nPolitics\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nJoshua Renken outlines what will have\nhappened last night, and what the next\nfews days may have in store for the\ngovernment\nThe elections are now\nover: so what\u2019s next?\nThis election was a big one. The\nstakes were incredibly high;\nwith the size of the state, the\nunion of the United Kingdom and\nour position in the European Union\non the ballot, and with the added\nnuanced policy debates around the\nNHS, immigration, housing, our\nnuclear defenses, the continuation of\nausterity and political reform, there\nwas certainly something for everyone\nto sink their teeth into.\nBut for all the impact that the\nresults will have, you would be\nforgiven for thinking this was a\npretty standard issue election. All the\nparties ran remarkably risk averse,\nsterilised and sometimes downright\ndull election campaigns, with no real\nstand-out moments.\nAnd to top it all off, after all the\nsound and fury, the polls didn\u2019t seem\nto budge after more than a month of\ncampaigning, much to the annoyance\nof journalists looking for a headline.\nThe Conservatives were edging it\nin the polls for the last few weeks of\nthe campaign, during which time\nthe various party leaders universally\nopted for a very stage-managed\nappeal to voters through the media,\nwith virtually no walkabouts among\nthe general public and a great deal of\nbackroom spin.\nSo, in case you haven\u2019t heard, we\nhave a hung parliament. If we don\u2019t\nhave a hung parliament this article\nwill sound very stupid indeed, but\neveryone will be too distracted by\nhell freezing over to care about my\nblunder. In fact, this time round we\nhave an even more \u2018hung\u2019 parliament\nthan in 2010. Unfortunately this\narticle was written before the\nresults actually came in, but we will\nstruggle manfully on (Fucking print\njournalism, you can see why it\u2019s dying\ncan\u2019t you?).\nThis means that regardless of\nwhether the Conservatives or Labour\nhave won the most seats, we still do\nnot have a majority government.\nNeither party reached the magic\nnumber of 326 seats (half the\nnumber of MPs plus one) so they\nneed extra support from smaller\nparties to \u2018command the confidence\nof the House of Commons\u2019 and\npass a Queen\u2019s speech, the only test\nfor a stable government that really\nmatters.\nThis means we are in for a\nfascinating few days, or even weeks, of\ncoalition talks.\nHere\u2019s what could happen...\nFarage\u2019s UKIP steals the\nvotes but not the seats\nDespite winning around an eighth\nof the votes across England, UKIP\nonly have a tiny number of MPs in\nparliament. Nigel Farage\u2019s party has\nmade a huge impact on the results\nof this election, but not because of\nthe constituencies they won. Rather\nbecause they will have stolen a decent\nchunk of traditional Tory votes,\nwhich would have otherwise won\nDavid Cameron the election. Farage\nhas said that if he loses in the South\nThanet he is contesting he would step\ndown, giving huge motivation for\nthe larger parties to keep him out of\nWestminster.\nThe Lib Dems will be the\nhardest hit, but there could\nbe another coalition on the\nhorizon\nThe Liberal Democrats will have\nlost a large number of their MPs,\nwith only those more Tory-leaning\nmanaging to survive. The slightly\nmore left leaning Lib Dems will lose\nout to Labour in many marginal\nconstituencies.\nDespite experiencing heavy losses,\nthey still have a big influence in\ncoalition talks.\nNick Clegg has ruled out a coalition\ndeal with the SNP, but has said he\nwould be prepared to agree to a deal\nwith Labour.\nMany Lib Dems were strongly\nopposed to the coalition deal struck\nbetween Clegg and Cameron in 2010,\nand the Lib Dems have traditionally\nbeen considered ideologically closer\nto Labour than the Conservatives,\nthough this might be brought into\nquestion if another Lib Dem \u2013\nConservative coalition deal is struck.\nWhat will happen beyond the\nwall?\nThe SNP have overtaken the Lib\nDems as the third largest party in\nparliament \u2013 though not by the\nnumber of votes across the UK \u2013 but\nthe Scottish nationalists will only be\nbackbenchers, provided Ed Miliband\ndoes not go back on his promise not\nto strike any kind of deal with Nicola\nSturgeon. Miliband might come\nto seriously regret that decision if\nit scuppers his chances of forming\nanything other than a Labour\nminority government.\nThere is a certain degree of\ncrossover in the Labour and SNP\nmanifestos, and around three quarter\nof all votes cast in Scotland will be for\none of these two parties, which have\nled many to suspect that the SNP\nwould give their tacit approval to a\nLabour administration.\nSome major Labour scalps will\nhave fallen to the SNP, as Sturgeon\nmade the weather north of the\nborder. They\u2019ve outflanked Labour\nby offering a more convincing\nalternative to the Conservatives, in\naddition to winning added support as\nthe pro-independence party, which\nwas supported by 45% of Scots in the\nreferendum last year.\nThe SNP have positioned\nthemselves as a bolder, more\nprogressive left-wing party than\nLabour, by opposing austerity and\ncalling to scrap Trident. On top of\nthis, the referendum allowed the\nScottish Nationals to sell their brand\nvirtually non-stop for two years,\nwhile the Westminster parties were\non the same side working together\nwhich as tainted Scottish Labour. If,\nby some minor miracle, many in the\nlast cabinet manage to defend their\nseats against the wave of SNP support,\nthe Liberal Democrat-Conservative\ncoalition could be in for a second\ninnings.\nThe story of this election is\ndefinitely that of relative stagnation\nin England, Wales and Northern\nIreland, but revolution in Scotland.\nMuch of this is down to the SNP\u2019s\ncharismatic leader Nicola Sturgeon,\nwho is the only party leader who isn\u2019t\nactually standing as an MP.\nThe closest election yet?\n2015 has seen a huge number of seats\ndecided by less than a thousand votes\neither way, with many constituencies\non a knife-edge on top of very tight\nparliamentary arithmetic.\nDUP wins Northern Ireland,\nLabour wins Wales, the Conservatives\nwin England and the SNP win\nScotland.\nIf Labour and the Conservatives\nare on a very similar number of seats,\nplus or minus 15 from 280, then\nMiliband is more likely to become the\nnext PM, because he has more paths\nConsectetur adipiscing elitaliqua. Photo: Crea\n\u201cNeither\nparty\nreached\nthe magic\nnumber of\n326 seats\u201d\n\u201cThe\nLiberal\nDemocrats\nwill have\nlost a large\nnumber of\ntheir MPs\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "28 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n08.05.2015\nArts Editors Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFred Fyles inds common ground between two very different shows\nFrom the Renaissance to the Modern\nT\nhe end of last month\nsaw the opening of two\nexhibitions that delve into\nthe world of art history\nand theory, taking a critical look at\nthe development, continuation, and\ndeconstruction of certain techniques\nwithin the art world. At first glance,\nthe two couldn\u2019t seem more different,\none dealing with renaissance\ndrawings and the other focussed on\nmodern photography. But scratch\nbeneath the surface, and they actually\nshare many things in common: an\nappreciation of the production of\nimages, an exploration of their forms\u2019\nrespective pasts, and an emphasis on\nthe importance of context within the\nfine arts.\nFirstly we have Renaissance\nModern, a collection of 16th\nCentury\ndrawings and prints selected from\nThe Courtauld Gallery\u2019s collection;\non display in their new Gilbert and\nIldiko Butler Drawings Gallery, an\noasis of warm-wooded calm amongst\nthe Neoclassicist confines of the main\ngallery, the exhibition takes a look at\nhow the renaissance idea of \u2018modern\u2019\nwas formed. A series of engravings\nand drawn works form a visual essay\non the history of the era, during\nwhich critical thinking about the\npast began to truly interact with the\nartistic world, setting the path the art\nworld would follow until Futurism\ntried to free it from historical\nbondage.\nCertain themes crop up in the\ndisplay, showing us what modernism\nmeant to the Flemish, French, and\nItalian artists featured. Collaboration\nwas a key development; the use of\nprints meant that visual ideas could\nbe disseminated easily across the\ncontinent. For example, Hendrick\nGoltzius\u2019 engraving of Spring is used\nby another artist for their own work,\nin which they add floral garlands\nto Spring\u2019s body, emphasising his\nandrogyny. The gallery is set up so\nthat these images follow one another,\ngiving us an immediate context for\nthe image.\nElsewhere, there is evidence of an\nincreased focus on narrative value,\nwith painters and artists mining\nthe rich seam of European liturgical\nimagery for their allegorical works.\nDetails took on a new importance,\nhelping to convey the message\nof the artist. Thus, Martin van\nHeemskerck\u2019s drawing of Magdalen\nwashing Christ\u2019s feet features\nRomanic architecture, further\nblurring the line between modern\nand ancient. Elsewhere, artists\nturn to ancient tales like Ovid for\ntheir inspiration. Technological\ndevelopments get a nod, such\nas in Barocci\u2019s study of Christ\u2019s\ncircumcision, which features new\ncoloured chalks, but on the whole\nthe collection works as a paean to\nthe importance of line drawings.\nNowhere is this more evident than\nLuca Cambiaso\u2019s wonderfully\nthrilling drawing of a cavalry battle;\ncomposed of mere lines and squiggles,\nit manages to convey the fury and\nspeed of warfare with a skill that\nwould be unmatched until Giacomo\nBalla.\nWhile many of the works were\ncomposed as studies for larger oil\npaintings, the quiet, unassuming\nnature of the gallery allows us to fully\nenjoy these small drawings, inviting\nus to revel in their intimacy.\nEast London\u2019s Whitechapel\nGallery hosts the next exhibition,\nand the environs couldn\u2019t be more\ndifferent. Their latest exhibition,\nChristopher Williams: The Production\nLine of Happiness, replaces their\nsummer extravaganza Adventures of\nthe Black Square, but upon entering\nthe space, it immediately appears\nthat they\u2019ve forgotten to clean up.\nCaptions for the previous exhibition\nremain on the walls, and the\nintroduction to Black Square is still\nthere, bisected by a large swathe of\ngreen paper. However, this is all part\nof the master plan of the exhibition,\nbilled as \u201can essay in photographs,\nprinted matter, dialogue, and walls\u201d.\nThe third in a line of exhibitions\n(previous ones were held in Chicago\nand New York), The Production Line\nof Happiness forms a wide-ranging\nretrospective of this little-known\nAmerican photographer.\nTaking inspiration from glossy\nadvertisements and the language\nof the magazine image, William\u2019s\nwork has a clear, non-expressionistic\nquality, that makes it particularly\nsuited for close-viewing. He has stated\nthat the ideas of his work can be\nfound in \u201ceveryday culture, the news\nkiosk\u201d, and this is only emphasised\nby the collection of images on\ndisplay; we close the show with a\nseries of images taken at a Japanese\nphotoshoot for a fashion magazine\n\u2013 Williams went along, having been\ngiven the technical specifications and\nnothing else, to produce work that\nwas intentionally different to the\nmagazine\u2019s work. What could be a\npicture to be published in the corner\nof the page, to be flipped over without\na second glance, enters into a gallery\nspace, and \u2013 with its low hanging \u2013\ninvites us to consider what is meant\nby art.\nWilliams is obsessed with the\ntechnicalities of photography,\nresulting in images that can serve\nas cryptic messages on the state of\nthe camera. His technically precise\nimage of a dishwasher, for example,\nwhich required painstaking set-up\nto prevent colour bleeding, takes its\ncolour theme from that of the Alfa\nColor film brand. Elsewhere, he takes\na 1968 Renault, and restages a scene\nfrom the Paris uprising, minus the\npeople and the chaos. Instead we have\na contemplative shot of the car on its\nside, its naturalistic lighting belying\nits technical complexity \u2013 it\u2019s his take\non Edward Weston.\nThose of you who are by this point\nrolling your eyes, bored of phrases\nlike \u2018institutional critique\u2019 and\n\u2018redundancy as a field of freedom\u2019,\nmight have a point. Williams\u2019\nwork is rich in message, positively\noverflowing with context, but the lack\nof explanatory material (Williams\u2019\nwork often has titles detailing all the\ntechnical specifications, making them\ntoo long to be printed \u2013 yet another\nlayer!) means that most of the work\ncan fly over your head, coming across\nas self-indulgent. I would argue that\nyou should give this exhibition a\nchance; there is an accompanying\npublication which, if your bank\nbalance can handle a hit, is likely to\nprove illuminating. There is magic\nwithin the work, but it requires an\neffort on the part of the viewer.\nKodak Three Point Reflection Guide (Meiko laughing) by Christopher Williams. Photo: Galerie Gisela Capitain and David Zwirner\n\"But scratch\nbeneath\nthe surface\nand they\nactually\nshare many\nthings in\ncommon.\"\n\"Williams\u2019\nwork is\nrich with\ncontext but\nthe lack of\nexplanation\ncan mean\nthat most\nflies over\nyour head.\"\n\n"

This\nis not a reflection on\nthe play\u2019s quality, or\nthe beauty of its verse, but rather\nan academic classification that\nhas been applied to the Bard\u2019s first\nJacobean work. Not quite a tragedy,\nbut retaining too much seriousness\nand darkness or a comedy, Measure for\nMeasure straddles a middle ground,\nmaking it ripe for interpretation\nand reinvention. And reinvention\nis precisely what we get with Cheek\nby Jowl\u2019s version of the play, a\ncollaboration with Moscow\u2019s Pushkin\nTheatre that transports the rulers\nfrom dukes to plutocrats, the time\nfrom the Middle Ages to modernity,\nand the language from English to\nRussian.\nFar from ironing out any of the\nproblems inherent within the play,\nthis production revels in the messy,\nambiguous nature of Shakespeare\u2019s\nwork.\nThe play centres around Claudio\n(Petr Rykov), who comes under fire\nfrom Angelo (Andrei Kuzichev) for\ngetting his partner pregnant; Angelo\nhas been left in charge after the Duke\n(Alexander Arsentyev) left the city\non what he claimed was a diplomatic\nmission. But of course this wouldn\u2019t\nbe a Shakespeare play without some\ndegree of subterfuge, and the Duke\nhas actually snuck back into the city\ndressed as a friar, in order to observe\nAngelo\u2019s iron rule. Just in the nick\nof time the Duke intervenes to save\nClaudio\u2019s life, returning to power on\na wave of good feeling that he himself\nhas created.\nAs you would expect with such\nplays, there are a number of sub-plots, and sub-sub-plots to follow,\nbut this production has radically\nstripped most of that away, resulting\nin a run-time of under two hours.\nWhile some may decry this as a\ndefilement of the original text, it\nactually means that we get to spend\nmost of the play focussing on Isabella,\na novice nun and sister to Claudio,\nwho appeals to Angelo to save her\nbrother\u2019s life. Angelo agrees, but\nonly on the condition that Isabella\nsurrenders her puritanically-guarded\nvirginity to him. Isabella refuses, in\nno uncertain terms: \u201cBetter it were a\nbrother died at once/Than a sister, by\nredeeming him/Should die forever\u201d.\nAn exploration of both sexual\nneuroses and religious fanaticism, of\npower and powerlessness, of woman\u2019s\nmuch-maligned place in the world,\nIsabella is one of the most interesting\ncharacters in Shakespeare\u2019s work,\nand Anna Khalilulina plays her with\nastonishing power.\nEncased in starched white gowns,\nKhalilulina is simultaneously coy\nand innocent; her frustration at\nbeing a mere pawn in a world of\nmen is etched on her face, clear for\nall the world to see. At points, she\nAlexander Matrosov, Peter Rykov, Alexander Arsentyev in Measure for Measure. Photo: Johan Persson\n\"Cheek by\nJowl have\nbrought an\nimmense\nenergy\nto the\nBarbican\u2019s\nstage.\"\n\"This\nproduction\nrevels in\nthe messy,\nambiguous\nnature of\nthe original\nwork.\"\nseems a million miles away from the\ntraditional idea of a Shakespearean\nwoman, instead inhabiting the grand\ndames of Greek tragedy: Elektra,\nMedea, Antigone. Kuzichev is\nsimilarly adept in the role of Angelo;\na character that can be played either\nmenacingly or comically. Kuzichev\nopts for the former, imbuing his\ncharacter with an ice-cold personality\nand a series of sexual hang-ups.\nWhere the play lets itself down is\nthe way the Russian translation is\nhandled. I am not trying to say that\nRussian is an unattractive language,\nbut so much of Shakespeare\u2019s power,\nwhat makes it endure to this day, is\nthe astonishing beauty of the spoken\nverse. The fact that they have surtitles\nhanging above the stage (and \u2013 at\nleast for those near the front \u2013 at an\nincredibly inconvenient angle for\nviewing) is more of an annoyance\nthan a help: the translation flashes\nso fast across the screen that most\nof what is said is being lost, and by\nthe time you look back down you\u2019ve\nmissed a majority of what the actors\nare doing. It must be disconcerting,\nfor a play that is so heavily involved\nwith the idea of audience (the people\nare audience to Claudio\u2019s torment;\nthe Duke is audience to Angelo\u2019s\ntyranny), when the cast find that\nmost of theirs is staring at a space\nthree meters above the stage. A\nmuch better idea would be, if not to\nremove the surtitles completely, to\ntake a leaf from the Globe to Globe\ncampaign, which saw Shakespeare\u2019s\nGlobe perform work in a multitude\nof languages, and instead just\ndisplay a general overview of what is\nhappening in the plot.\nHowever, once one has made\nthe decision not to pay attention\nto the surtitles, it is possible to\ntruly appreciate the magic of the\nstagecraft. And what stagecraft.\nCheek by Jowl, well known for\ntheir dynamic performances, have\nbrought an immense energy to the\nBarbican\u2019s stage. Their simple setting\nis dominated by five large red cubes,\nbetween which the cast, clustered\ntogether like a pack of wolves,\nduck and dive; the various players\ncongregate, forming an intimidating\nmass that spits out characters,\nallowing them to perform their\nscenes, before drawing them back\ninto their mass of hands and feet.\nThe climax of this staging comes with\nthe introduction of a double-bass,\nwhich \u2013 aside from reminding me\nof Kate Bush\u2019s video for \u2018Babooshka\u2019\n\u2013 signals the beginning of a waltz,\nstruck up by Claudio; from there we\nhave a whirlwind of activity, in which\nthe \u2018Bed Trick\u2019 \u2013 where Isabella is\nswitched for Mariana (Elmira Mirel),\nunbeknownst to Angelo \u2013 is carried\nout spectacularly. It is one of the most\nengaging pieces of physical theatre I\nhave witnessed.\nOf course, it would be amiss to\nreview a modern work coming out\nof Russia without trying to make an\nanalysis of how it related to Putin\u2019s\nrule. Cheek by Jowl and the Pushkin\nTheatre make it clear what they\nthink of modern Russia: Angelo is\na besuited tyrant, bringing the full\nforce of the law down on a single\nindividual in order to make a point,\nbut the Duke is no unambiguously\nmoral character either, manipulating\nthe orchestrations of the state to\ncome out on top, displaying his\nbenevolent mercy in front of a\nbeatific crowd. This production\nof Measure for Measure takes the\nmistreatment of a single citizen\nas a starting point, looking at how\nbureaucracy within Putin\u2019s Russia\ncan be used to undermine and isolate\npeople; like Andrey Zvyagintsev\u2019s\nrecent acclaimed film Leviathan,\nMeasure for Measure decries the power\nof \u201cman, proud man/drest in a little\nbrief authority\u201d.\nWith such profound ideas going\naround, it is a pity that awkward\nsurtitling should turn our attention\ntowards other things, and away from\nthe magic happening on the stage\nright in front of us.\n\n"

After all,\nreinterpretations are all about the\nretelling of classic story in a way a\nmodern audience can relate to, right?\nSo Emteaz Hussain wrote Blood \u2013 as\nshe herself puts it, \u201ca contemporary\nurban love story\u201d of two British\nMuslims, Caneze and Sully, fighting\ntheir family ties for the sake of\nlove. The result is a play even more\nremoved from a modern audience\nthan the 16th\ncentury one it\u2019s inspired\nby.\nThe text oscillates between forced\npoetical lyricism and overeager\nbradistani dialect \u2013 think wannabe\nShakespeare, but down with kids. The\ndrama revolves round the stereotyped\nlives of young, northern, working\nclass Muslims, surrounded by gang\nwarfare, matchmaking aunts, and\ndiscrimination.\nFor someone like your reviewer,\nonly recently out of teenagehood, the\nadolescent love scenes are cringingly\nmumsy: he raps about his love to her\n(raps! He actually raps, I kid you not),\nshe wears his jacket to school, and\nthey have an illicit picnic in her room\none night. More than a retelling of\nRomeo and Juliet, Blood had all the look\nof being a middle class and middle\naged idea of what a gritty version of\nHigh School Musical would be.\nAs far as the text is concerned,\nBlood is absolutely irredeemable;\nthe dialogue will make you squirm\nfrom start to finish, the jarring \u201cinnit\nbruv\u201ds clashing with the predictable,\npseudo-dramatic repetition of bad\npoetry.\nYet, miraculously, despite the\nrelentlessly awkward text, Blood\nmanaged to be a decent and almost\nmoving production. With the\nexception of film stars taking the\nstage, going to the theatre normally\nequates to going for the play alone.\nGenerally, one goes for the\nperformance and not for the actors;\nthe plays themselves get reenacted,\nredirected, reinvented. A good play\ncan be ruined by bad actors, but\nit will find another life in a more\ncompetent cast. In this case however,\nthe production was saved by two\nstartlingly good actors. Krupa Pattani\nand Adam Samuel-Bal convey enough\nyouthful passion and teenage angst\nto transform Caneze and Sully\u2019s lines\ninto something meaningful. They are\ngood enough to allow the audience\nto almost forget the clunky text,\ntransporting them along on the wave\nof emotions.\nStarting off a bit shaky (the accents\nwas a bit touch and go) the pair\ngrow into their roles throughout\nthe play and, in doing so, take you\nwith them. They transform from\none dimensional stereotypes of\nteenagers to almost-believable, fully\nrounded people, overcoming the huge\nhurdle posed by the often unnatural-sounding lines they are hampered\nwith.\nAdam Samuel-Bal gives a goofy\nspin to his character, breaking up the\nforced drama with some genuinely\nfunny moments. The two, as well\nas acting their own part, also act\nout the other characters through\ntheir recollections. The whole play\nis recounted by them, a flashback\nthat enables them to relive their\nstory. Samuel-Bal\u2019s impression of a\npushy Pakistani aunt is priceless, as\nhe jumps from one side of the table\nto the other, acting out both parts\nof the dialogue. Krupa Pattani is\nexceptionally good at evoking other\ncharacters; she switches from her\nslightly petulant feminine character\nto a gang-leader bully boy effortlessly.\nIn one scene she tells of how her\nfamily-imposed fianc\u00e9 comes over\nwith a copy of Asian Bride, showing\noff about how opulent their wedding\nwill be. Using nothing more than\nmere body language, she conjures up\na muscular, small-town henchman.\nIn another, she shows both sides of\na rape scene with startling efficacy.\nBoth the actors and the director,\nEsther Richardson, are responsible\nfor the success of these scenes, as\nthe minimal props on the stage\nallow a cast of two to populate a\nworld filled with family, employers,\nfellow students and colleagues. Arun\nGhosh\u2019s electronic score is also worth\na mention, as it underlines the clash\nbetween the lightness of Sunny and\nCaneze\u2019s love and the oppression of\ntheir cultural restrictions.\nAll in all, Blood is an unusual\nexample of actors so good that they\nredeem a truly execrable play. Or\nmaybe it\u2019s an example of a play\nso unutterably bad that even two\nenergetic and talented young actors\ncan\u2019t make you forget quite how\npredictable and jarring the text\nactually is...\nBlood is on at Soho Theatre until 16th\nMay.

With plays\nsuch as the Royal Court\u2019s Hope, the\nTricycle\u2019s Multitudes, and Donmar\u2019s\nThe Vote all exploring the issue of\npolitics within modern Britain, it is\nno wonder that incoming director\nof the National Theatre Rufus Norris\ndescribes the theatre as the nation\u2019s\ndebating chamber.\nAs such, his decision to put on\nCaryl Churchill\u2019s play Light Shining\nin Buckinghamshire, which deals with\nthe Levellers, a 17th\nCentury political\ngroup, makes perfect sense. It is a\ncredit to both Churchill\u2019s writing and\nLyndsey Turner\u2019s direction that the\nproduction seems as relevant today\nas it did when it was first staged in\n1976. So much has changed, and yet\nso little.\nA major difference in this\nproduction is the scale of everything;\nwhile the original run only had six\ncast members, the National\u2019s version\nhas a cast of at least 50, if not more,\nresulting in a sense of epicness. This\nhelps to drive the plot along, imbuing\nthe rebellion with a real feeling of\nconsequence, but the problem is that\nindividual characters can sometimes\nget lost in the general melee of\nstatesmen, soldiers, and religious\nnutjobs.\nThe staging is similarly grand,\ntaking the form of a vast table,\naround which officials in starched\nblack robes scribble down officious\nnotes; however, Es Devlin\u2019s ingenious\nset design means that the setting - in\nthe best possible way - threatens to\novershadow the cast.\nAs time goes on ornamentation is\nremoved from the table; what begins\nas a vast feast eventually becomes a\nplot of earth, emphasising the link\nfrom farm to plate which, if it was not\nlost then, is certainly lost in today\u2019s\nmentality.\nTaking on a portion of British\nhistory that is rarely visited \u2013 and it\nis a shame, since it is truly fascinating\n\u2013 Light Shining in Buckinghamshire\nfocuses on the build-up to the\nEnglish Civil War, following which\nOliver Cromwell took power, and its\nimmediate aftermath.\nMany of those who fought in\nthe battle did so out of a sense of\nfrustration against the political status\nquo of the day, and yet once the battle\nwas \u2018won\u2019 many found that things\ncarried on much as they were \u2013 same\nshit, different clothing. Out of the\ngeneral antipathy against those in\npower, a group called the Levellers\nsprung into being.\nBased on a foundation of legal\nequanimity, religious tolerance, and\nmass suffrage, the Levellers embodied\na sense of British political radicalism\nthat has continued to this day\n(something that Turner makes clear:\nthe promotional material for the\nplay features a simulacrum of a trade\nunion banner, which are still being\nmade today).\nWe follow the Levellers on their\njourney, from belligerent group of\nindividuals, to arguing factions at the\nPutney Debates, to a group of proto-Occupy agrarians, and finally to a\nbroken movement, crushed by those\nat the top.\nLight Shining in Buckinghamshire\nis not a comprehensive history;\nit eschews a formal narrative in\nfavour of highlighting the key\nevents, skipping between a few key\ncharacters, which ensures it manages\nto cover a dynamic period of history,\nbut does make it a little bit difficult\nto follow.\nThis structure means that no single\ncharacter monopolises the attention,\nbut a couple of performances stand\nout (no mean feat given the ensemble\ncast): Ashley McGuire is by turns\nhumorous heartbreaking as the\nvagrant Margaret Brotherton; and\nTrystan Gravelle is excellent in\nhis role as the disillusioned soldier\nBriggs.\nA play that celebrates a period of\nBritish history that could not be\nfurther removed from St George\ncrosses and the na\u00efvely bucolic view\nof pastoral heritage that has been\nsold to us by a Tory government,\nLight Shining in Buckinghamshire is\na strong start for Norris\u2019 tenancy,\nespecially considering the imposing\nvoid left by Nicholas Hytner. A\ntimely celebration of the history of\nBritish radicalism, a lineage that has\ncontinued through the Suffragettes,\nthe trade unionists, and \u2013 one hopes\n\u2013 the youth of today, this production,\nwith its canny direction, excellent set\ndesign, and sharp script, is definitely\none to try and see.\nLight Shining in Buckinghamshire is\nrunning at the National Theatre until\n22nd\nJune.\nTickets from \u00a315; available online,\nfrom the NT website.\nAshley McGuire as Margaret Brotherton in the National Theatre\u2019s\nproduction of Light Shining in Buckinghamshire Photo: Marc Brenner\n\"It is a\ncredit to\nChurchill\u2019s\nwriting\nthat the\nproduction\nseems as\nrelevant\ntoday as in\n1976\"\n\"Light\nShining is a\nstrong start\nfor Richard\nNorris\u2019\ntenancy as\ndirector\nof the\nNational\"\n\n"

Angman,\nwho was protesting on behalf of Sport\nImperial. Mr Angman told us that \u201cit\nobviously wasn\u2019t the most ausipicious\nstart to proceedings.\n\u201cWe went there to protest about\nhow Felix has ruined Sport Imperial\u2019s\ngood name, just because the women\u2019s\nrugby team didn\u2019t know how to book\ntheir own coach.\u201d\nMost protestors echoed Mr\nAngman\u2019s comments, with one\n(who asked to remain anonymous)\nclaiming that the fight started\nbecause \u201cthese fat girls started saying\nwe were supporting a bunch of\nmisogynists, and we couldn\u2019t let them\nget away with that.\n\u201cNot after those wankers at Felix\ncalled them misogynists, anyway.\u201d\nThe protests come after Felix\nfamously caused an outcry over\nwhat is now being called \u201cFarsity\u201d,\nwhere various bad things happened\nto various people but it\u2019s all been\nresolved now so let\u2019s just gloss over it.\nHangman reached out to the Felix\nEditor for a comment, but were yet to\nreceive a (printable) response before\ngoing to print. which shows how\nmuch she cares..\nThis issue of Hangman has been\nbrought to you thanks to the kind\ngenerosity of a donor who asked to be\nnamed only as \u201cS I\u201d.\nVoter turnout higher in ICU Big\nElections than #GE2015\nShadow cabal\nunmasked at Imperial\nHangman launches #JeSuisSportImperial\nHangman kicks off the conversation.

Photo: Imperial College\nNews in Brief: Hangman is beach body ready\nwe go vote whereas the government\nalways says that they\u2019ll just think\nabout lowering tuition fees and they\njust spend the rest of their term\nwanking.\n\u201cAlso ICU is getting Professor\nGreen to come to the Summer Ball- i\nheard that he hit a guy in Durham\u201d.\nAnother student emphasised his\napathy due to the fact that the main\nparties had nothing that he could\nrelate to: \u201cI don\u2019t see the point in\nvoting because to be fair after i do\nthe mongol rally and find myself\nin Thailand i\u2019m gonna work for\nGoldman Sachs which means that i\nbasically will own politicians.\n\u201cI think i\u2019m going to buy a\nthoroughbred eton one.\u201d\nHe again emphasized the fact the\ndisillusionment in the fact no real\ndifference was made by the parties:\n\u201cChris Kaye promised us fresh\npizza bases which he can actually\ndeliver on, but an end to zero hours\ncontracts? I don\u2019t think so mate\u201d.\nThere was, however, a hint of\noptimism from a biology undergrad\nDaisy Doran-Bown who actually did\ngo and vote: \u201c I really enjoyed voting-it was well exciting! I voted for the\nGreen Party because i really like how\nthey love the earth and say no to\nnuclear because it\u2019s not like we even\nuse it\u201d.\nWe then asked if she agreed with\nthe Green party policy of limiting\njail sentences for women who only\ncommit seriously violent crimes.\n(Editor\u2019s note: this is actually one of\ntheir policies. The more you know.)\nShe replied \u201cOh i didn\u2019t actually\nread their manifesto thing. I just\nheard they were going to legalize\nweed and it sounded good to me.\u201d\nThere were also a surprising\nnumber of international\ncommonwealth students on UKIP\u2019s\nelectoral register.\nWhen we asked Pei-Wen from\nChemical Engineering why she\nvoted for a party adamant on closing\nBritain\u2019s borders, she replied that\nit had been a very well informed\ndecision.\n\u201cI took the Buzzfeed\u2019s \u2018which\nUK party leader are you?\u2019 test and\nI received 96% chance I was Nigel\nFarage and I guess since Buzzfeed is\nrun by journalists, the results have got\nto be true\u201d.\nWhat is definitely certain is that\nuntil we have a party leader with as\ndashing blonde locks as Lucinda or\nLuke, Imperial suffrage will remain\nlow.\nBut not, Hangman hastens to add,\nas low as British suffrage.\n\n"

An effective staging\ndevice it may be, but the overall\neffect is to create a play that is all too\ncerebral when compared to the warm\nscript.\nO\u2019Neill\u2019s only comedy, written just\nthree years before he won the Nobel\nPrize for literature, Ah, Wilderness!\ntakes its name from a refrain of the\nPersian poem, The Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar\nKhayy\u00e1m, which is among a selection\nof works adored by the central\ncharacter Richard Miller (George\nMacKay) \u2013 a headstrong, volatile high\nschooler going through the pains of\nyoung love and reckless rebellion.\nSet on the Fourth of July, 1906, Ah,\nWilderness! shows the bittersweet\nnature of youth, and acts as a\nmeditation on the nature of memory,\nbut above all serves as a warm family\ndrama, in which comedy by far\noutweighs the tragic elements.\nAt least, that is the impression one\ngets from the script. For the Young\nVic\u2019s production there seems to have\nbeen a decision to take a more serious\nroute, portentously emphasising\nthe unhappiness of O\u2019Neill\u2019s life;\nAh, Wilderness! becomes much more\nabout the inner turmoil of the writer,\nrather than an exploration of family\nlife and relationships.\nWhile the relationship Richard\nhas with his parents, Nat (Martin\nMarquez) and Essie (Janie Dee), is\nfirm but nurturing, O\u2019Neill\u2019s actual\nchildhood was far from happy:\n\u201cunwanted, no love or tenderness,\nno care, no protection!\u201d wrote his\nwidow, Carlotta Monterey, following\nhis death. And thus, Ah, Wilderness! is\ntransformed into a heavy melodrama,\nin which the older Richard (played\nby David Annen, in what is clearly\nmeant to be an imitation of the\nolder O\u2019Neill, who by this point had\nturned to the bottle) surveys every\nscene, occasionally commenting or\ngiving stage directions. This addition\nisn\u2019t quite intrusive, but is never\nnot noticeable \u2013 Annen floats on\nthe peripheries, dancing around the\naction at the centre, in a role that adds\nlittle to the overall production.\nJudging from her last production\n\u2013 Happy Days, in which Juliet\nStevenson is buried up to her neck\nin dirt \u2013 Abrahami seems to have a\nthing for the earth, a reputation that\nis only confirmed by the expanse\nof sand that covers the stage. A\ncollaboration with designer Dick\nBird, this intervention generally\nworks very well, creating a strange\nnew landscape, through which the\ncharacters traverse unsteadily, and\nadding another layer of meaning to\nthe foundation of the script.\nHowever, there are moments when\nit doesn\u2019t quite come together - the\nscene at the \u2018house of sin\u2019 for instance,\nwhere Richard goes after being\nspurned by his young lover, resembles\nmore a nightclub than a speakeasy,\nand is jarring to say the least.\nHowever, there are also moments of\nsheer magic within the setting, and\nthe final act is really something to\nbehold.\nWith such an attempt to add in\nhigh drama to what should be a\ncomedy tinged with melancholy, Ah,\nWilderness! runs the risk of turning\ninto a stony Ibsenesque production,\nor perhaps a Chekhovian melodrama.\nHowever, the lightness and vivacity\nof the acting talent saves the day;\nMacKay, fresh from his cinematic\nturn in Pride, is impressive as Richard,\nimbuing the character with a fiery\nheart and a self-assured exterior\nthat belies the romantic within. Dee\nis excellent as his long-suffering\nmother, proving that maternal love is\nlimitlessly extensible, as is Susannah\nWise, who plays Aunt Lily, trapped\nbetween her love for Sid Davis\n(Dominic Rowan, who fills the role\nwith aplomb) and her hatred for his\ndrinking.\nWhile the staging and the\ndirection may tend to sand off the\nedge of humour and deaden the\ncomedic lightness, this production\nof Ah, Wilderness! still manages to\nbe entertaining, proving that \u2013 no\nmatter what happens \u2013 the brilliance\nof O\u2019Neill\u2019s writing will still shine\nthrough. Abrahami and Bird should\nbe congratulated for their radical\ninterpretation of the play, which is\ncertainly creative and new, but the\nreal congratulations should go to the\nfaultless ensemble cast, who show us\nthat wilderness can be paradise.\nAh, Wilderness! is on at the Young Vic\nuntil 23rd\nMay.\nTickets from \u00a310.

If this fails, then\nan alternative administration can\nbe created. If, for whatever reason,\ncoalition talks completely fall flat\nthen we could see a second election\nthis year, though this is highly\nunlikely.\nQuestions of legitimacy will\ninevitably arise. Should the prime\nminister be the leader of the\nlargest party, or the leader who can\ncommand the greatest coalition\nmajority in the House of Commons?\nWho is willing to hold hands\nwith Cameron?\nThe Conservatives have ruled out a\ncoalition with Labour, the SNP, the\nGreens and Plaid Cymru, leaving\nUKIP, the DUP and the Lib Dems as\nthe only realistic partners.\nHowever, the Lib Dems wouldn\u2019t\nbe likely to make compromises for\nthe sake of the small number of\nUKIP MPs, and even if all four of\nthese parties did somehow agree\non a coalition they won\u2019t make the\nnumbers.\nThis has led many to consider\nthe possibility of a grand LabourConservative coalition, similar to\nwhat occurred during World War II\nwith Churchill\u2019s war ministry. But\nthis would be truly remarkable in\nBritish politics.\nThe unlikelihood of a grand\ncoalition, despite its superficial\nappeal, cannot be overstated.\nWhether it\u2019s Ed Miliband or David\nCameron walking into Downing\nStreet, they will need to show a great\ndeal of humility and must give the\nimpression of a cooperative spirit.\nThe next parliament is set to be one of\nthe most volatile and unstable in our\nhistory.\nElectoral reform could be put back\non the agenda, despite the fact we had\nan alternative vote referendum only\nfour years ago.\nWe have officially moved into a\nmore continental style of politics. The\nLabour-Conservative duopoly has\nbroken down, perhaps for good.\nIn the next few days Northern\nIreland\u2019s representatives might come\nto the fore, if the right-wing DUP\nand left-wing Sinn Fein enter into\nnegotiations with the Conservatives\nand Labour respectively. The DUP are\nlooking to win around 8 seats while\nSinn Fein are expected to have 5 MPs\nin parliament.\nThis could make all the difference\nfor a party to crawl across the 326\nfinishing line.\nIt is important to mention that\ninstead of formal coalitions, where\nsmaller coalition partners typically\nreceive cabinet and ministerial\npositions in government as the\nLib Dems did in 2010, some minor\n\u201cWe have\nofficially\nmoved into\na more\ncontinental\nstyle of\npolitics.\u201d\n\u201cThe next\nparliament\ncould be\none of\nthe most\nvolatile and\nunstable\nin our\nhistory.\u201d\nparties could agree to a \u2018confidence\nand supply\u2019 arrangement where they\nvote through a Queen\u2019s speech and\npass vital actions of the government\nthrough the House of Commons,\nwithout being given official positions.\nIn this case, their influence would\ncome through when negotiating with\nthe larger party on the nature of the\npolicy, budget, law or anything else\nbeing discussed.\nThe big prediction\nConservatives and the Lib Dems have\nboth lost two dozen seats, Labour\ngained a dozen, the SNP won at least\nthree dozen more constituencies in\nScotland and other parties such as\nUKIP, the Greens and Plaid Cymru\nhave made no significant advances\nin parliamentary representation.\nThis would put the Tories on around\n290, Labour on 260, the Lib Dems on\nroughly 25 and the SNP on up to 55.

Not a conventional\ntourist destination for a couple\nof UK residents, I\u2019ll admit, but we\nhave always preferred adventurous\ndestinations over beaches crammed\nwith lobster-red tourists eating icecream and tripping over beach towels.\nThere is something so much more\nfulfilling about exploring a different\nculture independently and seeing\nhow local people live compared\nto staying in one fixed place and\nparticipating in the structured,\npredictable day-trips organised by a\ngeneric big-name travel company.\nBetween the pair of us, Dad and I\nhave crossed a variety of countries on\nfoot; by train; by rickshaw; and 4X4,\neach time stopping and seeing what\neach region had to offer on the way.\nThis time we have teamed up to cross\nmost of the breadth of Eurasia, as a\nkind of nod to our love of adventure\nbefore I move out of the family home\nfor good.\nThe best part of our plan is that this\nendeavour \u2013 being on a somewhat\nlarger scale than normal \u2013 is going to\nbe done in the name of a good cause.\nThis is because my father and I are\nnot driving to Ulaanbaatar entirely\non our own: we are doing it as one of\nthe teams entering the Mongol Rally\nfor 2015.\nApparently, there are enough mad\npeople out there who want to break\ndown in the middle of a desert or\nhalf way up a mountain for dozens\nof teams to pack their bags and drive\nto Mongolia from the UK every year,\nand there are even organisations who\nhelp with the important legal bits like\nhow to get visas and ship the car back\nhome.\nDad and I are doing the Mongol Rally\nwith the Adventurists, which means\nthat we will have to comply with\nthree golden rules:\n1.You can only take a farcically\nsmall vehicle\n2.You\u2019re completely on your own\n3.You\u2019ve got to raise \u00a31000 for\ncharity\nThe Vehicle\nIn our case, the ridiculously small\nand underpowered car will be\na 26-year-old Citroen AX. This\nis a car older than most of the\nUndergraduates at Imperial. With\na top speed of under 60mph, it is a\ncar which actually gets overtaken\nby speed-limited lorries on the\nmotorway, and where you wait until\na downhill stretch before attempting\nany overtaking yourself.\nThis car will need to deal with\nroads covered in rocks, pitted with\npotholes, or potentially covered in\nsand. The kind of roads associated\nwith big, powerful cars with high\nground-clearance. Even with larger\nwheels fitted, you wouldn\u2019t be able to\nfit a normal tin can under the AX. As\nfor power, I suppose we could attempt\nto fit a sail to the roof and pray for\nwind.\nA lot of work has gone into fitting\nthe Citroen with a sump guard, to\nprotect the underside of the car\nfrom attacks from aggressive rocks.\nThis constituted getting hold of a\nlarge sheet of aluminium \u2013 the kind\nyou normally see making up metal\nwalkways \u2013 and cutting the thing\ndown to size. Dad then made a large\nindent at the point where it needed\nto bend to weaken it, and we had to\nstrategically roll over it with a (larger)\ncar in order to get it to fold correctly.\nIt is now majestically bolted under\nthe front of the AX.\nWe also need to pack a lot of\ngear: tents, camping stove, sleeping\nbags, clothes, maps, water, jerricans\nof spare fuel, and spare tyres. It\u2019s\npretty heavy stuff- so much so that\nDad had to beef up the suspension\nto prevent the car from sinking too\nlow. It will be a tight squeeze in a car\nThe route that Amelie and her father will drive through with the Cool Earth group - passing through France, Germany, Poland, Ukraine, Russia,\nKazakhstanm and finally Mongolia itself.

As they\ncame round the bend to the final lap,\nSarah had stepped it up and was 10m\nclear, and was excitingly closing the\ngap on the leader. Unfortunately she\nran out track to complete her chase,\nbut finished in a comfortable 2nd\nin\n36:32.08 after running a very smart\nrace.\nAlberto\u2019s race was a highly\ntactical affair. With a field full of\ninternational athletes and a windy\nback straight nobody wanted to push\nthe pace.\nAfter an extremely slow first 3k in\n9:50, the runners were getting uneasy\nbut a huge final km burn up was\nclearly on its way.\nAt this point Alberto took the\ninitiative and stepped up the pace,\nimmediately drawing out the field\nto leave Birmingham and St.Mary\u2019s\nchasing him down.\nThe final 1500m ramped up\nin speed until it came to the last\n600m where Birmingham\u2019s athlete\ndrew level. With an admittedly\nphenomenal kick he accelerated into\nthe bell, with Alberto hot on his heels.\nUnfortunately, Birmingham\u2019s last\nlap was well below 60 seconds and he\ncouldn\u2019t be caught, though not for\nlack of trying, but Alberto managed\nto hold off St.Mary\u2019s for the silver in\n15:19.38.\nThere were other great\nperformances from the Imperial\nteam over the weekend with Gil\nMachado fighting a gripping 800m\nheat to make it to the semis and first\nyear Chris Olley easing through to\nthe 1500m semis, only to have a very\nunfortunate fall which prevented him\nreaching the final.\nAthletics Captain Gareth Holden\nand Liana Spyropoulou also narrowly\nmissed out on qualification spots in\nthe 400m and 400m respectively.\nWith all a lot of young talent across\nmultiple events, the future looks\nbright for Imperial Athletics.\nThe community has never been\nstronger and with our partnership\nwith Thames Valley Harriers\nproviding us with training and\nfacilities there is great potential for\nthe coming years.\nThe team is keen to showcase their\nabilities in Imperial\u2019s final fixture\nof the season at the London College\nAthletics Series at the end of May.\nThis meet is open to all abilities, so\nif you\u2019d like to get involved, find us\non facebook or email run@imperial.\nac.uk!\nFat or muscle?\nWe are inviting healthy volunteers to take part in a research study comparing body fat and metabolism in young adults.

Into\nthis bastion of self-righteousness\narrives a trendy young designer/\ncoder/penniless hipster, Eames,\nplayed by the rather excellent tenor,\nPaul Curievici. Hilarity ensues as\nEames\u2019 offer to \u2018upskill\u2019 the de Selby\u2019s\ntoolbox by \u201cthrowing some blue sky\u201d\nat the problem is met with Ellipsis\u2019\nicy \u201cWe are prop- makers, sir; we do\nnot peddle mere insinuations.\u201d And\nso on, in a rather wordy recitative\nthat leaves the audience glued to\nthe surtitles for fear of missing an\noverwrought pun or cleverer-than-thou reference, and thus failing to\nlaugh at the right moment.\nNevertheless, there are enough\ngiggles to be had from the sending up\nof startup and self-help doublespeak\nto keep you following along, and\nenough of a snook cocked at the\nridiculousness of operatic logic and\nHigh Art for you to flatter yourself\nthat you\u2019re in on the joke. Soon\nthough, the librettist, Sally O\u2019Reilly,\nremembers that this is High Art after\nall, and that in High Art it\u2019s not good\nenough to snigger at Very Serious\nPeople of both the Middle Aged\nand the Millennial variety, but it\u2019s\nimportant to make some Very Serious\nPoints yourself. In this case, it\u2019s in the\nform of some Alain de Botton-level\nsemiotics and an earnest discussion\nof the essence (virtues?) of things.\nLuckily, this is defused by Eames\u2019\ndeclaration that the most significant\nwoman in his life is his \u201clife coach \u2013\nGod rest her soul.\u201d\nThat, unfortunately, is the high\nwater mark, and the rest of the\nlibretto is a straight-faced but\npantomimic (it\u2019s behind you!) stagger\ntowards a final scene involving the de\nSelbys\u2019 death-by-meaning overload.\nThis happens in a set of their own\nmaking, containing both the universe\nand \u201cthe world of the atom\u201d, which\nserves mainly as a set-piece for the\nlighting designer, Matt Haskins. As\nthe story becomes less funny, the\nshortcomings of the orchestration\n\u2013 either nondescript background\nmusic, or intrusive and slightly out of\nwhack with the story \u2013 start to assert\nthemselves. High points remain,\nmainly through Ellipsis\u2019 descent\ninto madness (whose operatic logic I\nwon\u2019t attempt to explain here), as she\ntakes over the dramatic mantle from\nthe early Peg-Eames interplay, but\nnot enough to overcome the distinct\nimpression \u2013 not quite dispelled by\nSelby\u2019s closing almost-aria \u2013 that this\nwas less an opera than a play with\nmusic.\nThe Virtues of Things is the second\nof three annual showcases of the\nalumni of various Aldeburgh\nMusic development programs, in\nconjunction with Opera North and\nthe Royal Opera. Last year\u2019s offering\n\u2013 two, short, debut acts from novice\ncomposers \u2013 received (that old\nchestnut) mixed reviews; the writing\nand score were criticised for their\ncomplexity and ambition, while the\ncast and orchestra were praised for\nmaking the most of what they had\nto work with. This year, according to\nthe programme, the focus has shifted\nto \u2018rising stars\u2019, with only O\u2019Reilly\nreally being new to opera. The various\ndirectors of Aldeburgh Music, the\nRoyal Opera, and Opera North thus\nclaim that The Virtues of Things\nshould not be seen as \u2018artist training\u2019,\nbut as \u201can opportunity to engage\naudiences in the most innovative and\nhighest quality composition\u201d. This is\na shame, as it comes off a lot better\nin the former light than the latter:\nRogers\u2019 score is certainly promising \u2013\ninnovative, though not gratuitously\nso \u2013 and the performances of all\nof the cast, particularly Curievici,\nare impressive, especially given\nwhat\u2019s asked of them. This sounds\nan awful lot like last year\u2019s verdict \u2013\nentertaining in parts, disappointing\nin others, but a damned good show\nfor the first time around.\nThe Virtues of Things ran in the\nLinbury Studio Theatre at the Royal\nOpera House. It will now be performed\nat Aldeburgh and Leeds.\nDavid Stout, Fiona Kimm, Robyn Allegra Parton and Paul Curievici in the Royal Opera House\u2019s production of The Virtues of Things.

Is it the\nbacon sandwich which wins? Photo: The Standard\nNick Farmer really hopes that you voted to save us all\nThe Tories are the right choice\nThe last few years have taken\na real toll on Britain. The\ncoalition\u2019s austerity agenda\nhas held our economy back, harmed\nthe most vulnerable, and made\nour society more callous and self-interested than at any time in the\nlast 30 years. The only way we can try\nto sort this is to vote for the Labour\nParty.\nFirst and foremost we have to\nthink about what kind of society\nwe want to live in. Do you want to\nlive in a country where the disabled,\nthe sick, and the vulnerable are\nvilified as \u201cspongers\u201d and a drain\non society, a country in which the\nheight of morality is looking after\nNumber 1 and the best policy is the\none that keeps cash in the pockets\nof the well-to-do? The only way\nto stop the Conservative Party\nfrom spending another five years\ndestroying the NHS, the education\nsystem, and the welfare system is to\nvote Labour. While many on the left\ndisagree with Labour\u2019s plans to cut\nthe deficit, their plans involve tens\nof billions of pounds less in terms of\ncuts to vital public services than the\nConservatives. The gap between the\ntwo parties on this is colossal and\nis vitally important to millions of\npeople across the country; if one more\nvulnerable person with mental health\nissues or a disability dies because of\nthe Conservatives\u2019 savage cuts then a\nvote for the most credible alternative,\nthe Labour Party, is more than\njustified.\nSecondly, a Labour government will\ndeliver a stronger economy. Taking\nbillions of pounds out of the economy\nby cutting spending on welfare, on\nschools, and on hospitals; on things\nthat result in investment going back\ninto the economy and people having\ncash in their pockets to support\nbusinesses has cost us all dearly.\nSince the financial crisis in 2008\nwe have seen, under a Labour\ngovernment, an economic recovery\nsupported by considerate and well\nthought out economic policies,\nfollowed by a sharp and drawn\nout recession caused by austerity.\nTracking GDP growth in the UK\nagainst the USA shows a clear trend;\nuntil 2010 both countries were\nrecovering from the global financial\ncrisis when the coalition government\nmade an ideologically motivated\nmove towards austerity, pulling the\nrug out from underneath our society\nand economy.\nThe result? Our economy contracts\nwhile, across the pond, economic\ngrowth continues. Over the next\nHaving been running\nthe Imperial College\nConservative Society for\nabout a year, I have met with many\nstudents in Imperial College London,\nand surprisingly, most of them claim\nthat they support the Conservative\nParty. This has also been reflected on\nthe poll conducted by Felix. Today I\nwant to convince the rest of you that\nConservative is the best party to vote\nfor.\nWe are the only party with a\nsensible economic policy. Look at\nthe alternatives: the Green Party,\nraising minimum wage to \u00a310, this\nshows that they probably have no\nidea what inflation is. Labour, their\npolicy is simple, banning poverty.\nThe rent prices are too high? They\nwill ban it from rising. Fuel and gas\nare too expensive? They will ban it\nfrom rising, too. If managing the\neconomy were so simple, Imperial\nwould not provide a masters degree in\nEconomics. Is UKIP any better? Their\nentire policy is to exit the EU and cut\nforeign aid.\nThe Conservatives want to cut\nincome tax, so people have incentive\nto go to work and can keep more\nof their income. We want to cut\ncorporation tax, so that there will be\nmore businesses with more jobs. We\nbelieve that the economy is organic, it\nonly grows when the people inside are\nprospering, working hard, producing\ndesirable goods and services, not by\nthe government artificially injecting\ncash or creating less efficient public\nsector jobs.\nI do not want to flood you with any\nmore of Conservative Party policies,\nas I am sure you have heard enough\nfrom the media. One thing that\nwas not talked about enough is the\nfundamental ideological difference\nbetween the Conservatives and the\nLabour Party. We believe in working\nhard to achieve a better life for\nyourself and your family, and we\nbelieve in equality in opportunity\ninstead of outcome.\nThat is why all of our policies are\nabout rewarding those who go to\nwork. That is why we believe benefits\nshould only be given to those in\nneed, such as the disabled, not those\nperfectly healthy 20 year-olds who\ncannot be bothered to get a job.\nWe believe in allowing everyone\nto achieve the maximum of their\npotential, not to punish the brightest\nso that we have a so-called \u201cfair\u201d\nsociety.\nLastly, although I am tired of\nhearing it, this is probably true. If\nwe do not have majority, we will\nprobably end up with a Labour-SNP\ncoalition; this means those who want\nto break up our country would run\n\u201ca Labour\ngovernment\nwill deliver\na stronger\neconomy\u201d\nparliament the Conservatives would\nhold our economy back even more by\nusing the excuse of pubic debt (which\npales into insignificance as a problem\ncompared to economic growth, but\nthat\u2019s a story for another time) to\nmake more ideologically motivated,\ndeeper cuts which will set our\neconomy even further back and harm\nthe prosperity of us all, even people\nwho consider themselves the kind of\nwealthy people who the Conservative\nParty should be looking out for.\nThe only way to stop this, to get\nour country back on the right track,\nis to vote for the Labour Party. In\nEd Miliband we have a leader who\nwill bring honesty and integrity, and\nassertiveness when it counts most, to\ngovernment. A vote for the Labour\nParty is not a vote for a perfect\npolitical party, but it is a vote for a\ngood one. A vote for a party that will\ninvest in the NHS, that will scrap\nthe bedroom tax, that will treat the\nvulnerable in society with the dignity\nthey deserve. You don\u2019t have to agree\nwith every one of their policies or\nthink that all of their candidates are\nbreathtakingly amazing to realise\nthat they are the only people who\ncan stop this country taking another\ndownward spiral for the next five\nyears.\nI hope, for all of our sakes, that you\nvoted Labour yesterday.\nNICK FARMER\nCOMMENT WRITER\nRobert Zhou thinks that the Conservative Party is the best option\nour country. I am sure this is not\nsomething that you would like to see.\nOr the fish and chips? Photo: Independent\n\u201cnot a vote\nfor the\nperfect\npolicical\nparty, but\na vote for a\ngood one\u201d\n\n"

Despite\na slightly weaker plot than hoped,\nGolem\u2019s message about corporate\ngreed and human idleness is\npoignantly addressed by its technical\nachievements. With stunningly\nbeautiful visuals, an incredible\nsoundtrack, and a remarkable\nattention to detail, theatre company\n1927 present a truly unforgettable\npsychedelic nightmare \u2013 Golem is\nquite simply an artistic masterpiece.\nLiving in the nameless dystopian\nparallel of a European metropolis,\nthe Robertson family are shy, geeky,\nand wildly unpopular.

Both are part of\nthe punk band \u201cAnnie and the\nUnderdogs\u201d, despite being too shy to\nactually perform in public. With dull\nand uninteresting lives, Robert works\nin an equally dull job: \u201cbacking up the\nback-up\u201d by writing out all the ones\nand zeros by hand. But Robert does\nhave one friend, a genius inventor\nwho, having invented a whole range\nof junk, finally comes up with his\nkiller invention: the Golem, an\nautonomous clay man to serve his\nmaster\u2019s every whim.\nA critique of man\u2019s desire to have\neverything they want, the Golem\nsymbolises corporate control over\nThe members of the English\nTouring Theatre assemble\nin the Barbican\u2019s theatre for\ntheir production of A Mad World My\nMasters, and there is an elephant in\nthe room. Based on the 1605 work\nby Jacobean playwright Thomas\nMiddleton, this production of A Mad\nWorld My Masters has been transposed\nfrom the metropolis of 17th\ncentury\nLondon to the vice-filled streets of\n1950\u2019s Soho. Of course, with such a\nconstruct, one is almost obliged to\nconsider the National Theatre\u2019s\nhugely successful production of One\nMan, Two Guvnors, in which James\nCorden filled the main role; with a\ntraditional source material updated\nto a nostalgia-tinged vision of the\nrecent past, an emphasis on slapstick\ncomedy, and a huge amount of\nbawdy humour, the comparison is\ninevitable. Sadly, A Mad World My\nMasters is a disappointment; maybe I\nam holding it to too high standards,\nbut the whole thing is about as funny\nas an am-dram production, put on in\na village hall.\nWith its seedy brothels and\nwandering \u2018ello-\u2018ello style policemen,\nmid-century Soho does form a fitting\nbackdrop for the action of A Mad\nWorld My Masters, which \u2013 like most\nJacobean plays \u2013 features a number of\nintertwining plotlines.\nThe main one centres around\nDick Follywit (Joe Bannister), who\naims to squeeze as much money out\nof his stingy uncle, Sir Bounteous\nPeersucker (Ian Redford), as he can.\nAlong the way we are introduced\nto Mr and Mrs Littledick \u2013 the\nJacobeans were anything but subtle\n\u2013 played by Ben Deery and Ellie\nBeavan respectively, an unhappily\nmarried couple; he is overprotective\nand jealous, she longs for the self-flagellating pimp Pertinent Brothel\n(Dennis Herdman).\nThe cast all do a great job in their\nrespective roles, with many imbuing\nthem with a great deal of physicality\nand verve.\nSarah Ridgeway is brilliant as the\nprostitute Truly Kidman, whose\nmother has managed to convince\nthe lads of Soho that her daughter\u2019s\nvirginity is intact. Ridgeway\u2019s lines\nprovide some of the only truly\npertinent humour of the play,\nwhether it be exposing the class\ndivisions that accents reveal, or\nexploiting the foibles of men, making\nher way in a patriarchal society.\nThe pity is that this is as deep as the\nhumour goes. For the most part, the\nbrand of comedy is similar to that\nyou would find in a Blackpool music\nFRED FYLES\nSECTION EDITOR\n\"The whole\nthing is\nabout as\nfunny as\nan amdram\nproduction\nin a village\nhall \"\n\"Sarah\nRidgeway\nis truly\nbrilliant\nas the\nprostitute\nTrudy\nKidman\"\nthe masses: the effect of capitalism\non our actions, opinions, and\nappearance. The show\u2019s set \u2013 born out\nof animation \u2013 forms a continually\ntransforming backdrop, unparalleled\nin its ability to wonderfully and\nsimply convey the surreal nature\nof the setting. With the actors\nseamlessly interacting with the\nanimation, and with the projections\nnever feeling out of place or poorly\nthought out, the achievements of\nthis show are almost a little hard to\nbelieve.\nI don\u2019t really want to pick out\nthe work of the individual actors,\nsince the cast is exceptional, but one\nmoment in particular did strike me;\nhall around 50 years ago. It\u2019s all very\nmuch Carry On..., wink-wink-nudge-nudge, postcard humour that went\nout of fashion long ago. Perhaps it\nis no surprise that those laughing\nthe loudest came from a sea of silver\nhair, who were probably alive during\nthe time this type of humour was\npopular, and can therefore look at it\nwith gentle appreciation.\nBut then maybe it\u2019s just me; I will\nfreely admit that such jokes just don\u2019t\nsit well with me. If you\u2019re a fan of\nsexual innuendo, Barbara-Windsorstyle winking to the audience, and\nplay-on-words involving phrases like\n\u2018cunning stunts\u2019, then perhaps A Mad\nWorld My Masters is the play for you;\nas for me, I think it should leave with\nthe tide.\nA Mad World My Masters is on at the\nBarbican Centre until 9th\nMay. Tickets\nfrom \u00a310, available online\nShamira Turner as Robert spends\na hefty part of the show walking\nfrom location to location; but with\nnowhere really to go, the effect of\nrushing through a city is achieved\nby a rhythmic stationary movement\nagainst a panning animated\nbackground. My words don\u2019t really do\nit justice. It was simply extraordinary.\nCreated by 1927, Golem is written\nand directed by Suzanna Andrade\nwith film, animation, and design by\nPaul Barritt.\nThe performances are sharp and\nentertaining, but there is little depth\nto the story. That being said, little is\nneeded to convey their point. Reading\npart of an interview with Barritt in\nthe programme, the sentiment of his\nwork is clear:\n\u201cDoes this mean your basic narrative\nis that any decent idea will inevitably be\ndestroyed by capitalism?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nWhether he\u2019s right or not I don\u2019t\nknow, but it\u2019s always intriguing when\nan anti-capitalists perform their\nwork in the West End \u2013 a corporate\npowerhouse if ever there was one.\nFair enough for Barritt, the show\nneeds to be staged somewhere, but\nit makes taking a message away that\nlittle bit harder.\nGolem is on at Trafalgar Studios until\n22nd\nMay. Tickets from \u00a310. Available\nonline\n\n"

treated\nunfairly compared to the men\u2019s team,\nwho also played at the sporting event\nat The Stoop, Twickenham.\nThe women\u2019s team were left playing\nto an empty stadium after coaches\nwere allowed to leave the stadium\nearly, which also resulted in leaving\nsome members of the team without a\nway to get back to South Kensington\nafter the game.\nThey also reported abusive\nbehaviour from a member of Sport\nImperial staff, and several girls on the\nteam reporting that the same member\nwas heard over a walkie-talkie to say\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how those fat girls
