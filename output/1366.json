    "content": "And there is no need to be afraid\nAt Christmas time we pre-order games only for them to be delayed. Do they know it\u2019s Christmas time at all?\nAh, laziness. Face it; we\u2019ve all been\nthere. Whether it\u2019s ten extra minutes in bed, getting the bus when\nwe could have walked, or leaving\nit a month to write your first Felix\npiece. Delays are commonplace in\nthe world of gaming.\nWhen a new console or killer\ngame is announced, you don\u2019t expect it to be released on the first\ndate that\u2019s set (especially if you\nlive in Europe). You have to wait\nto see when the first delay will be\nannounced to get a better idea of\nwhen you can get your grubby mitts\non the thing, only for your plans to\nbe smashed when further delays\nare announced. Great.\nSo delays, then. What has recently been delayed? Well, the episodic\ntrilogy expansion thing for Half Life\n2 has recently suffered a setback.\nEpisode 2 (along with Team Fortress 2 and Portal \u2013 you get them all\ntogether in one big, shiny pack for\nanyone that didn\u2019t already know)\nhas been pushed back to some time\nin 2007. I think we can all live with\nthis one though, if only for the Portal expansion. Believe me when I\nsay this will keep FPS fans hooked\nfor days, and I can only imagine the\nmultiplayer possibilities. Check the\nofficial site (http://www.apertures-cience.com) if you want to see why\nit\u2019s worth waiting for.\nAnother delay announced earlier this month was for the World\nof Warcraft expansion pack, Burning Crusade. Originally tipped for\nrelease in time for Christmas, developer Blizzard has pushed the\nrelease back to January 2007, giving some excuse about allowing developers enough time to polish the\ngame.\nNow, I have two problems with\nthis. The first is that an excuse like\nthat is bollocks. \u201cPolish the game\u201d\njust has \u201cwe were too lazy to do it\nin time\u201d smeared all over it. They\ncouldhaveatleastputsomethought\ninto making it feasible \u2013 why not try\nthe old \u201cwe had a problem producing the PAL blu-ray diodes\u201d trick?\nSecondly is that I really don\u2019t think\nwe need an expansion pack for this\ndrivel. I would carry on with this\none here, but I think I\u2019ll leave it for\nanother time because I can go on\nfor ages and ages and ages. Which\nis still nowhere near as long as\nsome people spend playing the crap\n(Back in the drawer, Mister Sharp!\n\u2013 Mike)\nThe thing is though, there are\nsome times when the developers\njust go too far. Let\u2019s go back, to, ooh,\n1997? Perhaps one of the most well-known video game characters of\nshelves. The official line from developer 3dRealms is that it will be\nreleased \u201cWhen it\u2019s done.\u201d Wow.\nNobody knows what the hell is going on with them anymore, and they\ngive the most half-arsed release\ndate ever.\nGuys, you wouldn\u2019t release half a\ngame would you?! They even went\nas far as threatening legal action\nagainst a mod team developing a\nDuke 3D Source game, as a mod\nfor Half Life 2. My thinking is that it\nwas because Duke Nukem Source\nlooked considerably better than\nwhatever rubbish was being thrown\naround the development offices at\n3dRealms. Selfish gits.\nMaybe I\u2019m complaining too much\nthough. As the old saying goes, good\nthings come to those who wait. Most\nhope that the PS3 will be the best\non the market when (alright, if) it\neventually arrives. Many delayed\ngames in the past have been well\nworth the wait.\nRikki Norris\nIt\u2019s not just gamers who suffer when there are delays \u2013 Burning Crusade (above) was set to be a big Christmas seller for developers Blizzard\nthe time has his sequel announced.\nYes, ladies and gentlemen, Duke\nNukem himself would be reappearing in his brand new video game,\nDuke Nukem Forever.\nHaving played the original series\nlike the little nooblet that I was, I\nwas excited. So I waited. Screenshots were released, so I waited\na bit more. Videos were released,\nand still I was waiting. Here we\nare, a decade on, and Duke Nukem\n(taking) Forever is yet to hit our\nLeft \u2013 Half-Life 2: Episode Two, a triple pack of Source games now delayed until Summer 2007. Right \u2013 Duke Nukem Forever, and the newest screenshot available. Six years old\n\u201cLook at you, Hacker. A pathetic creature of meat and bone.\n\u201d \u2013 SHODAN,\nSystem Shock\n23\nfelix\nFriday 1 December 2006\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

So for those who have no idea why we are celebrating\nthis year, here comes the science bit\u2026\nImperial College was established in 1907 in London\u02bcs scienti\ufb01c and cultural\nheartland in South Kensington, as a merger of the Royal College of Science,\nthe City and Guilds College and the Royal School of Mines. St Mary\u02bcs Hospital\nMedical School and the National Heart and Lung Institute merged with the\nCollege in 1988 and 1995 respectively.\nCharing Cross and Westminster Medical School and the Royal Postgraduate\nMedical School merged with the College on the1st August 1997 to form, with\nthe existing departments on the St Mary\u02bcs and Royal Brompton campuses, the\nFaculty of Medicine.\nTherefore, this summer the college will be celebrating both \u201c100 years of living\nscience\u201d as well as 10 years of the merger of the three medical schools to\nbecome the School of Medicine.\nOver the past few months I have set up a project board to co-ordinate our\nclubs and societies into creating and developing their centenary ideas. In next\nweek\u02bcs issue of Felix I will be detailing as many events as possible that we have\nin store for you.

It has called\non outlets on NUS-affiliated university campuses to restrict the magazines to take titles like Nuts and\nZoo off the shelves and place them\nbehind the counter.\nThe magazines have also faced\ncalls from MPs for them to be consigned to the top shelves of newsa-gents, alongside more pornographic publications such as Readers\u2019\nWives, and a number of supermarkets have placed the magazines\nwithin \u2018modesty covers\u2019 to obscure\nthem from casual browsers. Sainsbury\u2019s is the most high-profile supermarket to have adopted these\ncovers, saying it acted after complaints from costumers.\nThe NUS National Women\u2019s Officer, Kat Stark, said that the National Union of Students fully supported the moves by supermarkets\nto reduce the visibility of the magazines to consumers, adding: \u201cMost\nof their content is demeaning and\ndegrading to women. NUS is therefore keen to see them relegated\nfrom the top shelf to behind the\nshelf throughout university outlets\nas well.\u201d The policy is voluntary, she\ninsisted, though some unions had\ntaken it up: \u201cNUS is pleased to report that a few unions have already\nmade the move to keep particular\n\u2018lad mags\u2019 behind the counter, and\nwe are supporting women\u2019s officers\nall over the country to lobby their\nunions into following suit.\u201d\nThe policy has faced criticism\nand ridicule from some. At Leicester University, where the union has\nintroduced the ban, the editor of\nthe student newspaper, Tom Goodwyn, has expressed dismay that the\nNUS has dictated what magazines\nthe outlets can stock. \u201cNuts and\n2 felix Friday 1 December 2006\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNuts and Zoo should be placed behind the counter, says NUS\nZoo target readers who are aged 18\nto 26, a good proportion of who are\nat university,\u201d said Mr Goodwyn,\nadding: \u201cHaving to buy them from\nbehind the counter is a bit dirty old\nman-ish.\u201d An online petition against\nthe ban has already gathered more\nthan 200 signatures.\nWith the recent referendum\nmeaning that ICU will affiliate to the\nNUS, it is up to the pro-NUS group\nto decide if this is a worthwhile use\nof the affiliation fee, and whether\nthe ban should be introduced here.\nOne of the lads\u2019 mags the NUS wants to move behind the counter\nUnion governance changes\napproved by College Council\nThe Governance Review being read for the first time at Union Council\nThe recommendations made by\nthe Union Governance Review is\nnow part of the the Union\u2019s con-stitution, having been approved\nby the highest body in College, the\nCollege Council.\nThe proposals have been a pet\nproject of John Collins, Union\nPresident, who set up a number of\nworking groups consisting of ex-hacks, current hacks and sabbs to\nreview the way the Union is run.\nThe most notable of the changes\nenacted is the introduction of another committee at the top level\nof Union governance, called the\nCourt. The Court\u2019s role is to rule\non disciplinary matters, including\nelection complaints. This should\nhopefully eliminate the partisanship normally involved when Council discusses election complaints.\nThe Court will be staffed by life\nmembers of the Union, along with\ncurrent members of the Union.\nNo current officers will be eligible\nto sit on the Court. The Court will\nalso be the ultimate body ruling\non complaints against the student\nmedia.\nThe other key change is the splitting of the Student Activities Committee, the body that deals with all\nclubs and activities, into two halves:\nthe Representation and Welfare\nBoard, and the Clubs and Societies\nBoard. The aim of this seems to be\nto make welfare a more important\nissue than it had previously been\nunder the SAC.\nA number of other committees\nhave been amalgamated, disbanded or renamed, including the replacement of the unpopular Trading and Retail Committee being\nreplaced with a number of \u2018forums\u2019\nthat interested parties may attend\nto discuss the issues directly with\nthe staff involved.\nLastly, the Permanent Secretary,\nhead of the Union staff, will be renamed Union General Manager,\nreversing the change made by ex-President Mustafa Arif.\nImage and word association you dumb moron\nPAGE 27 \u2013 GO THERE IMMEDIATELY.

It\u2019s nothing\nsexually deviant, or illegal. It\u2019s just\na bit... strange.\nAnd actually, if you looked at it\nyou might doubt that it wasn\u2019t sexually deviant, consisting as it does\nof a rather large round ball and an\neight-inch blue tube. But I can assure that it plugs into the television\nand is family-friendly.\nAhm. Yes. Best stop there.\nEuphemisms aside, it\u2019s actually a\nlightsaber game that plays directly\nthrough the television, imported\nfrom Japan by a friend of mine as\na gift. It\u2019s all in Japanese, which\nmakes it a little hard to distinguish\n\u201cNew Game\u201d from \u201cQuit\u201d and so\non, but this isn\u2019t really important.\nWhat\u2019s important is that I can\nswish the plastic lightsaber around\nmadly, and droids explode. And it\u2019s\nunbelievably cool.\nSomething special happens when\ngaming starts thinking outside of\nthe box. The results tend to be incredibly geeky, and rather strange\n\u2013 but no matter how much you\nsmirk, scorn or chuckle, there\u2019s still\na hardcore part of you that really\nmust have one this instant.\nTake, for instance, the NES Buckle (http://www.nesbuckle.com). It\u2019s\na classic, genuine 1985 NES con-WIN! \u2013 A WotR T-Shirt!\nWhy yes, yes they are hella cool. And because they love you so much,\nthe folks over at Way of the Rodent have given us three t-shirts to give\naway to our readers! Your choice of size and design is up for grabs if\nyou can convince us you\u2019re worthy.\nBut we\u2019re not messing around with multiple-choice questions here,\noh no. We want you to make us happy. It\u2019s December now, which\nmeans Christmas should be just twenty-five chocolate-filled days\naway \u2013 but we\u2019ve been told that we\u2019re simply too old to have advent\ncalendars any more.\nBalls to that. We want you to draw, paint, scribble, construct or just\ndash off in Microsoft Paint something festive and games-themed, and\neither drop it into the Felix offices (Beit Quadrangle, downstairs in the\nMedia Wing) or send it in hyperdigitalised form to games.felix@impe-rial.ac.uk with the subject line, \u201cObjection!\u201d.\nThe best three entries received by December 8th bag themselves a\nt-shirt each, it\u2019s as simple as that. Go get those crayons.\ntroller, grafted lovingly so that it\nworks as a proper belt buckle.\nNow, Lord knows that most people wouldn\u2019t be seen dead with it because it\u2019s just that little step too far\npast Geek. But you can\u2019t help look\nat it and feel that your life is emptier without one.\nAnd it\u2019s Christmas now, so who\u2019s\nto say it should be for a second long-er? But if you think you might like\nsomething a bit more fashionable,\nthen Way of the Rodent (http://\nwww.wayoftherodent.com) is one\nof the many gaming websites out\nthere on the web that have a t-shirt\nspinoff store.\nWotR\u2019s main site is a regular gaming magazine with a thriving internet community \u2013 but their shirt designs are a tasteful way to proclaim\nyour love for Ico, Phoenix Wright:\nAce Attorney and other games in\nan understated (and, yes, sometimes not-so-understated) way.\nBut both the NES Buckle and t-shirts with \u201cOBJECTION!\u201d written\non them in large, red letters share\none problem \u2013 they\u2019re fairly public.\nAnd not everyone\u2019s as happy with\nsharing their secret addiction with\neveryone else on the Tube.\nWell, there\u2019s more than one way to\nskin a bank account. Maybe you\u2019ve\nalways wanted to see your favourite\ngames immortalised forever in the\nform of... a game?\nEagle Games (http://www.eagle-games.net) is a boardgame designer and manufacturer that\u2019s converted some of the most popular\nvideogames of all time into some of\nthe most obscure boardgames of all\ntime.\nFrom the intruguing Railroad\nTycoon to the epic Civilization,\nthey\u2019re not the easiest things to\nget to grips with, and will certainly\ntake a little longer to complete on\nChristmas day than a game of charades (even with that particularly\ndeaf uncle of yours), but it\u2019s one of\nthe most interesting uses of videogames that we\u2019ve seen \u2013 even if it\u2019s a\nlittle obvious.\nIf nothing\u2019s hit you so far, well...\nyou\u2019re beginning to make life dif-ficult. And let\u2019s face it, if you\u2019re too\nself-conscious to wear a NES controller around your waist, then a full\nPrincess Peach outfit (http://www.\nfarmgoodsforkids.com) is probably\ngoing to be considerably over the\nmark. And Farm Goods\u2019 Mario costume merely makes you look like a\ncamp window washer.\nSo I guess that just leaves... cul-ture. Sigh.\nAlright, so maybe you don\u2019t actually want to do anything with gaming at all, you just find it interesting?\nHalf-Life 2 creators Valve released\nHalf-Life 2: Raising The Bar some\ntime ago, now \u2013 a book that delves\ninto the art direction, as well as the\ndeeper plot, of the seminal first-person shooter series. It\u2019s not Episode 2, but it\u2019s a good replacement\nfor the time being. Bungie commissioned a similar book \u2013 The Art of\nHalo \u2013 that explores the famous\ngame trilogy in-depth too.\nOr there\u2019s fiction. The decidedly\nless-geeky Halo Graphic Novel\nperhaps (http://snipurl.com/13cvy),\nfeaturing a collection of spinoff stories in Master Chief\u2019s universe, or\na collection of novels based on the\nResidentEvilcanon(http://snipurl.\ncom/13cw2). Or maybe you\u2019d just\nlike some Metal Gear Solid Vamp/\nRaiden hot gay fan fiction?\nWell we\u2019re not linking you to that,\nso there.\nBut you might find it all a bit\noverdone and hyped up. Halo, for\ninstance, is a game based around\nshooting the crap out of things.\nSubtlety, characterisation and plot\ndevelopment aren\u2019t high on their\nto-do list, and they don\u2019t always\ntransfer that well to story form.\nSo have we begun to scrap the\nbarrel yet? Not quite. There is one\nsensible suggestion left. Because\nif you\u2019ve gone through all that and\ndecided that you\u2019re just not brave\nenough to take the step towards\ngaming obsession, there\u2019s always\nfilm.\nResident Evil, Final Fantasy\nVII, Tomb Raider and now Silent\nHill have all been given the silver\nscreen treatment, as well as many\nothers \u2013 to varying levels of suc-cess. If you\u2019re looking for a quiet\nnight in but want to fondly remember the little grey box in the corner\nof the room, one of these should do\njust fine.\nWhatever you go for this Christmas, gaming isn\u2019t just about games\nany more. So if you\u2019re thinking\nabout spending a bundle on a next-gen console or some new hardware\nfor a PC, just bear this in mind :\nnothing says \u2018hardcore\u2019 like a lifesize statue of Lara Croft.\n(http://tinyurl.com/txz3m)\nYes.\nSome men who like to be open with their preferences.

Which means\nbuying a pretty dress going out\nand getting drunk in celebration\nof the birth of Jesus Christ. In\nhomage to Jesus, I've picked out\na few party dresses, selected for\ntheir skill in straddling the line\nbetween slutty and pretty.\nIf you want to look on trend,\nthen definitely go for gold. Every\nhigh-street chain will have a\nversion of that shimmering gold\ndress. Just make sure you tone\ndown the accessories. Add more\nglitz and people won't be able to\nlook directly at you, lest they be\nblinded. This look is best acces-sorized in black. Also a fashionable look is goth-romantic, to wear\nwith plenty of black eyeliner.\nTo cut down on time spent in\nthe changing room, there are\nsome basic rules to find a flattering dress for your body shape.\nIf you're curvy (Read: politically correct version of fat) then a\nplunging neckline is best to draw\nattention to your best feature.\nIf you're more hourglass, then a\nbelted A-line dress will look great\non your curves.\nFor lean figures, a strapless\ndress looks best, drawing attention to your delicate shoulders.\nRuffles on your bust, despite\nwhat fashion magazines tell you,\ndoes not add curves. It's just a\nbunch of ruffles stuck to a flat\nchest. If people actually mistake\nthis for voluptuousness then they\nare retarded.\nPetite figures look best in\na high waisted design whose\nhemline hits just below the knee.\nMost of the work is really done\nby very high heels; there's only\nso much a dress can do.\nIf you're tall then short dresses\nlook best with long legs. Avoid\nlong dresses, they will make you\nlook like a giant. You can also\nget away with bold prints. Wear\nheels at your peril.\nAthletic figures look balanced\nout with a flowing feminine\nsilhouette. If you' have the calves\nof a Hungarian shot-putter, then\na hemline hitting at mid-calf is\nmost flattering.\nAlternatively eschew all fashion advice and spend eternity in\na changing room cursing the 6\nitem changing-room rule, eventually ending buying a T-shirt. If\nyou follow one piece of advice let\nit be this, avoid Oxford Street at\nall costs. You're less likely to be\ncrushed to death by tourists on\nHigh Street Kensington.

They don\u2019t look dead to me, although some of them look rather disturbing\nGasp! An ironing board! Or perhaps not: the famous shock initial\naudiences felt at John Osborne\u2019s\nplay-within-the-prosaic will not be\nfelt today in an age used to \u2018social\nrealism\u2019 and Real Life Drama!\nYet the themes of disaffection, of\n\u201clacking a crusade worth fighting\nfor\u201d and of a messy, grudging love\nare ones that still strike a chord, arguably more so, with a generation\nwho live with the luxury of apathy.\nOsborne infuses the main protagonist Jimmy, an archetypal example of the Angry Young Men of the\n1950s, with a searing personality of\nfrustrated power. As he cascades\nthrough the play in a fury of an-tagonism, he still yearns for a \u2018human passion\u2019 and \u2018conviction\u2019, while\nmaintaining sensitivity to love and\nhuman companionship in an almost\nchildish dependence.\nJimmy\u2019s long-suffering wife Alison and his best friend Cliff suffer\nhis intellectual ranting and shocking attempts at drawing reaction\nin a loving relationship that seems\nat once bizarre yet understandable.\nAlison\u2019s colonel father provides an\nodd reflection of Jimmy \u2013 polar opposite in character yet similarly deprived of a concrete place, a role in\nthe world. It is only when Alison\u2019s\nfriend Helena enters the scene, un-fazed and grudgingly drawn to Jimmy\u2019s offensiveness, that he is chal-lenged, though not yet contented.\nEssentially it is Jimmy\u2019s effect on\nhis surroundings that proves the\ngreatest draw to the audience. His\nripples of anger and their contact\nwith loved ones make up only the\nimmediate, visceral excitement of\nthe piece, making the overarching\nthemes all the more powerful in the\ncontrast with the domestic setting\nthey transcend. The play works\non us, the audience, by presenting\nboth the unrestrained voice of frustration within us all and the figures\nof sensibility we use to hide behind.\nUltimately it is us who prove most\nshocking as, in those scenes of revealed humanity, we start to sym-pathise with this angry young man.\nSome people ask: what is the hardest thing about being in a play?\nAwkward rehearsal times? The\nmultitude of lines to memorise?\nStage fright? Well, the answer is\nsimple. It is getting us all out of the\nI have a confession to make. Before\ngoing to this production, I had never\nseen Porgy and Bess. I hadn\u2019t even\nseen the 1959 movie with Sydney\nPoitier. I do, however, own many of\nthe songs on CD as sung by Louis\nArmstrong and Ella Fitzgerald, and\nlike everyone else I know, hearing\nSummertime always brings a smile\nto my face.\nThe new production at the Savoy Theatre seems to be billed as\nGershwin for beginners. Rather\nconfusingly, Nunn has adapted it\nfrom an opera to a musical, which\nmostly seems to only have had the\neffect of cutting its length and the\nsize of its accompanying orchestra.\nAs a lover of Gershwin and opera,\nI approached the production with\ntrepidation; after all, why meddle\nwith perfection?\nThe first thing that struck me was\nthe quality of voice that had been\nchosen. Though clearly not oper-atic, the casting has been done so\ncarefully as to preserve the spirit of\nGershwinianoperaandthusjumped\nthe first hurdle of my prejudice.\nIn other ways the production has\nclearly tried to be as faithful to the\noriginal as possible. With the exception of a couple of minor roles,\nall parts are played by black actors\n(as Gershwin stipulated in his will),\nand the set and costumes are true\nto the backdrop of the work.\nBut I soon forgot about all these\nthings. I forgot to look for parts that\ndidn\u2019t work, for dialogue that wasn\u2019t\nright, because this is a magical\nproduction and I was completely\ntransfixed.\nEvery part, however small, was\nperformed exquisitely. During the\ncrowd scenes the cast moved as\none entity, flawlessly expressing\nthe community spirit which pro-Even though I can\u2019t imagine adoring this as much as the full opera,\nthere is nothing I could criticise\nabout the performance. It is quite\nsimply the most moving performance I have seen all year.\nhas so many clich\u00e9d pitfalls, yet\nPeters manages to avoid them all\nwhilst still not over-dignifying the\ncharacter. The scene where he and\nHughes sang Bess, You is My Woman Now moved me to tears, and I\nactually wanted to punch Bess for\nleaving him.\nvides the fertile bed from which the\nunlikely love story grows.\nBess (Nicola Hughes) is sublime\nas the abandoned prostitute taken\nin by Porgy (Clarke Peters), but it is\nhe who is the real star.

    "content": "On the 10th of November, 2006\nICSM saw its first charity talent\nshow held in aid of M\u00e9decins Sans\nFronti\u00e8res. The event at the Reynolds bar at Charing Cross Hospital\nincluded a broad and colourful variety of acts ranging from the 6 piece\nband, Dirtbag and the Empire, to\nthe dancers of The Ok Go! Team, to\nthe hip-shaking Shakira-esque bel-lydancer, Canan.\nM\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF)\nis an independent humanitarian\nmedical aid agency committed to\ntwo objectives: providing medical\naid wherever needed, regardless\nof race, religion, politics or sex and\nraising awareness of the plight of\nthe people they help www.msf.org.\nUnderstandably opportunities for\ninvolvement in MSF\u2019s international\nprojects require that doctors have\ncompleted at least two years at\nSHO level, therefore eager medical\nstudents wanting to get involved\nhave to wait patiently to apply. In\nRiding Club has recently become\nRiding and Polo Club, and to celebrate we had a weekend of polo\nrelated activities \u2013 panto-polo on\nSaturday and a couple of polo taster\nsessions on Sunday.\nSaturday started out pretty wet,\nand I think this put some people\noff, but there were still enough very\nkeen (or slightly mad) participants\nfor us to make our way over to Hyde\nPark and play some foot-polo. This\nwas great fun, much more difficult\nthan most of us were expecting, and\nresulted in almost everyone ending up on the floor at some point!\nOnce we\u2019d mastered the ability to\nactually hit the ball rather than the\nleaves, we played a couple of \u201cserious\u201d chukkas and the score was really close at 7-5. Then, when we\u2019d\nhad enough of being \u201cserious\u201d we\nbrought out the panto-ponies!! This\ncertainly got us plenty of atten-tion, lots of photos, including ones\ntaken with a woman out for her hen\nparty and a random American tour-ist, presumably to prove to their\nfriends that they didn\u2019t hallucinate\na group of students wearing inflatable horse-costumes playing polo in\nHyde Park! There are some amazing photos of this (especially of Jon\nMatthews for some reason\u2026) and\nthey\u2019ll be going up on our website,\nwww.union.ic.ac.uk/acc/riding, over\nthe weekend so go and have a look!\nSunday also started out pretty\nwet, which delayed our minibus,\nbut in the end we made it to FHM\nPolo Club in West Sussex, where\nwe met Francis Matthews, our\nnew polo instructor. We split into\ntwo groups for our taster sessions\nand learned how to deal with our\nponies, which are just about as different from riding school ponies as\nyou could imagine, as well as how\nto hit the ball\u2026although I think my\npony kicked it for me more than I\nhit it! We also learned a bit about\nthe rules and then played a mini-chukka. It was great fun and I\u2019m\npretty sure everyone that went enjoyed themselves, with several saying they were already addicted and\nwould be coming back for more. I\nhighly recommend the sport to any\nspeed-freak, played properly it really is fast! To make things easier it\u2019s\nbest if you can ride a horse in walk\nand trot without assistance before\nplaying polo, just so you\u2019re not worrying about what the horse is up to\ntoo much. This usually only takes\na few riding lessons to achieve so\ndon\u2019t be put off by it.\nIf you have any questions about\neither riding or polo, or if you\u2019d like\nto have a go at either, please get in\ntouch with us on riding@imperial.\nac.uk. We ride every Wednesday afternoon and our next polo session\nwill be on Sunday 10th December.\nRiders or polo players of any ability can be catered for. Also anyone\ninterested in borrowing/buying the\nhorses costumes for bar nights, fancy dress parties etc. get in touch.\nPantomime polo in Hyde park!\nPanto-ponies ready for action, plus random American who couldn\u2019t quite believe she wasn\u2019t hallucinating\nthe meantime, areas in which medical students can get involved are\nample and include raising awareness about MSF and its projects\nand raising funds for MSF as it is\na non-governmental organization\nand relies on donations from the\npublic.\nWith this in mind, a group of 5th\nyear IC medics came up with the\nidea of holding a talent competition\nin aid of MSF. Since an event of this\ntype had never been held at ICSM\nwe hoped it would attract a lot of\ninterest.\nAfter months of planning, the\nnight was finally upon us. With the\nsense of excitement and anticipation in the air, the audience started\narriving and before we knew it the\nstudent bar was heaving. The event\nproved to be very popular indeed. It\nwas inevitable that with a \u00a3100 cash\nprize up for grabs for the first-place\nwinner the standard of the performing acts was going to be very high.\nAnd they didn\u2019t disappoint; our two\njudges on the night were (Dr) Adam\nKay, who we all know and love for\nthe crude medical spin he puts on\nwell known pop songs, and Jennifer Van Griethuysen of the Medsin\nImperial committee. Between the\njudges and the show presenters,\nRichard Moss and Martin Bailey,\nthe humorous banter and cheeky\ncomments between acts added to\nthe entertainment of the night.\nWith an audience of about 350\npeople, it wasn\u2019t difficult to gage\nthe response to the various acts;\nthis was especially so for Rashad\nZafarulla\u2019sperformance as a human beatbox who won the competition hands-down by replicating\nvarious songs using \u2018the art of vocal\npercussion\u2019. He was even brought\nback on stage by Martin Bailey for\nan encore in which the two of them\nwowed us with an impromptu rendition of The White Stripes\u2019 \u2018Seven\nNation Army\u2019. Rashad was extremely generous in donating his\n\u00a3100 prize to the evening\u2019s cause.\nIn second place came the foursome making up The Ok Go! Team\nwhose awesome synchronised\ndance won them \u00a350 off a meal at\nCaf\u00e9 Lazeez in South Kensington.\nThey were closely followed by the\nexotic bellydancer Canan, who won\nthe third place prize of \u00a330.\nAs the judges deliberated over\nwho the winners would be, there\nwas another entertainment slot in\nstore in the form of the Bachelor/\nBachelorette Auction in which individuals were auctioned off to the\nhighest bidder who then got the\npleasure of their company for an\nevening along with two free cinema passes which had been kindly\ndonated by Vue and Cineworld cin-emas. The winning bids ranged between \u00a312 and \u00a335 and helped raise\neven more money for the event\u2019s\ncause.\nIn a final effort to maximise the\namount of money raised by the\nevent, a raffle was held, in which a\nnumber of donated prizes were up\nfor grabs. These included a number\nof Toni and Guy haircuts, a meal at\nNandos and a pair of tickets for the\nLondon Eye among other things.\nAll attendees were extremely generous in taking part in the raffle,\nmany people buying several tickets\nat a time.\nAll in all, the first Charity Talent Show at ICSM proved to be an\nextremely popular and successful\nevent. It would not have been possible without the hard work of the\norganising committee who were\nheaded up by Meryem Kaya and\nSamina Zaman, nor would it have\nbeen as successful without the\nvolunteers who helped out on the\nnight, of whom we must mention\nPhil Stennet who handled all the\nstage and sound equipment on the\nnight and IC\u2019s Jazz and Rock Society who provided the equipment\ncompletely free of charge.\nA number of companies were also\nvery generous in donating prizes\nfor our raffle, as well as donating\ncash amounts to help cover costs;\nthe latter consisted of the British\nMedical Association, the Medical\nDefence Union, the Medical Protection Society and Wesleyan Medical\nSickness. Their extreme kindness\nallowed all profits from the event to\ngo directly to MSF and enabled us\nto reach a grand total of \u00a32008.\nAudience wowed by MSF Charity Talent Show\nThe Talent Show Committee celebrates the end of a great show\nKat Gray\nICU Riding and Polo Club Chair\nSarah Benafif\n24 felix Friday 1 December 2006\nlubs& ocieties\nS\nC\n\n"

This\ninterpretation of history is by my\nunderstanding; clearly ridiculous,\ncompletely biased and according\nto most of the world\u2019s historians,\nwrong. I suggest to all the readers\nto get informed by reading any version of the facts that is neither bias\nfrom the point of view of the conqueror nor the conquered.\nWhen I read Saad\u2019s article I was\noutraged. In my opinion, confirms\nthe worst stereotypes of the war-mongering, completely biased\nMuslims. I feel it is my duty, in\nlight of today\u2019s conflicts, to stand\nup against this view type.

The Orthodox Christian church of the Holy Wisdom\n(the symbol of Istanbul) was turned\ninto a Mosque, parts of the population were enslaved, raped, and\nmurdered (it is true however that\nnormally invading armies did much\nworse, Mehmet II however, did not\nwant to destroy his new capital).\nMr. Raja states that the Byzantine Empire helped the crusaders\nin conquering parts of the Middle\nEast. But I would like to stress that\nthe Muslim armies commanded by\nMohammed himself and his successors conquered and completely\ncolonised the Christian Kingdoms\nof today\u2019s North Africa (e.g. the\nArab Republic of Egypt) and Middle East. \u2018How could a prophesized\nMuslim army behave in such a\nmanner?\u2019\nIn reference to the passage about\nthe influx of people to the newly\nconquered Constantinople, it is\ncommon belief that many important\ngroups of people fled the new re-gime, especially the educated peo-ple.

Many immigrated\nto Italy, and with their knowledge\nhelped to cause the Renaissance.\nThe west has condemned the\nCrusades, in fact the Pope has apologised for it, but not because it was\nan act of unjustified imperialism,\nbut because it is unjust to kill people for religious causes.

It was an event that\nany multi-cultured society would be\nenvious of; a discussion in which\nmany misunderstandings, fears\nand prejudices came to light to be\ndispelled for good.\nOne old lady, for example, stood\nup, faced a veiled woman and made\nan honest remark that epitomised\nthe feelings of many in the room, \u201cI\nhave lived in this area for seventy\nyears and the day your types turned\nup I was terribly shocked... You\nmust really frighten kids that pass\nyou. How they do not turn and run a\nmile I do not understand.\u201d\nHowever, the reality of it, as covered in the discussion, is far simpler\nto understand than our fears will\nhave us believe. Why would an innocent child, not yet subjected to the\nprejudices and ill-founded beliefs\nof those around it, turn and flee at\nthe sight of a simple black cloth? A\nyoung child knows that underneath\nthe cloth is a person and people are\nunderstood through interaction.\nAs the discussion of fear contin-ued, the issue of hoodies was raised,\n\u201cIs it fair to differentiate between a\nveiled woman and a hooded bandan-naed teen?\u201d Who better to answer\nthis than the local priest conveniently sporting a hoodie in anticipation of this topic, \u201cIf I was coming towards you on the street dressed as\nI am today, would fear cause you to\ncross over? Not likely. What if it were\na group of veiled women? Again, not\nlikely.Whatifitwereagangofteens?\nThe reality is, unlike hooded teens,\nhooded priests and veiled women\ndo not have a history or reputation\nof street-crime and theft.\u201d Towards\nthe end, a consensus began to take\nshape: A society forcefully dictating\nthat women should not wear the veil\ncannot rightfully claim to be better\nthan a society forcefully dictating\nthat woman should wear the veil.\nAnd at this point, a comment was\nthrown out, \u201cWhat about that man\nwho has been held in prison for the\nlast two years because he wants to\nwalk around Britain naked?\u201d\nFunnily, the room silently agreed\nto let the comment go without\nresponse.\nShould we fear the veil or tolerate it?\ncially Britain (with the largest\nEmpire in the world) now condemn Imperialism because they\nsupplanted undemocratic regimes\nin weaker countries and replaced\nthem with other undemocratic re-gimes, leeching the raw materials\nof the conquered lands. We do how-ever; celebrate historical events\nlike the victory of WWII by the al-lies. On that occasion, democratic\ncountries such as the US and the\nUK freed Europe and Asia from the\ngrip of military dictatorships such\nas Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan\nand Fascist Italy. Those battles\nbrought democracy back to people\nlike me; and are just to celebrate. I\ndon\u2019t think I would have been able\nto come and study here if Italy was\nstill a Fascist country. Mr. Raja, do\nyou really think that the Ottoman\nSultanate brought freedom and\ndemocracy to the people of Constantinople? Perhaps you should\nchoose medieval history as a humanities course here at Imperial.\nI agree with Samuel Lynas, what\nthe Islamic society has done could\nbe the same as celebrating the conquest of India by a British Empire\nsociety. It can be argued that this\nevent was a good thing; schools and\ninfrastructure were built and Hindus and Muslims weren\u2019t forced to\nconvert to Christianity. Yet we condemn what happened.\nLast week\u2019s article demonstrates\nthat aggressive Muslims are eve-rywhere, even at the institute of\nexcellence that is Imperial. That\narticle shows that there are people\naround us who don\u2019t believe in general morality. It is people like you,\nMr. Raja, who perhaps unknowingly\nencourage terrorism worldwide.\nPierluigi Frison\nI\u2019m the Warden at Holbein and\nWillis Jackson Halls \u2013 but rather\nthan just tell you about my Hall, I\nthought I\u2019d use my column space\nto talk about how Halls have\nchanged during my time here.\nI\u2019m lucky enough to have seen\nHalls from all sides: as a student,\nHall Senior (aka re-app), sub-warden, asst. warden and finally\nsubwarden. Obviously Halls has\nchanged a great deal since I\ncame to university twelve years\nago, subsisting solely on Fray\nBentos pies and Stella Artois for\nmy first year.\nCertainly the accommodation\nneeds of students have changed\n\u2013 I started Uni at a time when\ngrants were still available, and\ncheap accommodation was an\nimportant factor. However, as\na warden I\u2019m now often asked\nabout the availability of single\nand ensuite rooms in Hall. The\nfocus seems to have shifted from\naffordability to comfort.\nAlso, Hall events often used\nto be \u2018bargain basement\u2019 affairs.\nHall parties were very popular,\nwith a vat of flat pink liquid\noptimistically called punch being\nserved, whilst we satisfied the\nrequirement for fancy dress by\nwrapping ourselves head-to-toe\nin toilet paper. Of course it\u2019s a\ngiven that these events still take\nplace, but the diversity of our\nevents has increased dramati-cally. We\u2019re more likely now to\nbe organising events like a trip\nto a London superclub, a day\nout to Bruges or a Halal meal to\ncelebrate Eid. Halls culture has\nbenefited immensely from the\nincreased diversity of residents\n\u2013 it\u2019s an excellent chance to\nexperience other cultures.\nGiven that students\u2019 needs\nare always changing, wardening\nteams rely on our Hall Seniors\nto steer us towards what our\nresidents want. If your hall isn\u2019t\norganising events that appeal\nto you, or you want different\nfacilities, make sure that you\u2019re\nletting the wardening team know\nby raising it with us. We rely on\nyou to get things right. Better\nstill, get involved! The wardening\nteam can help you organise an\nevent and may even be able to\nhelp with a subsidy\u2026.\nAlthough Halls have changed\nconsiderably since my arrival,\nI\u2019m pleased to say that the fundamentals are still the same. Halls\nprovide a unique community\natmosphere which I still very\nmuch enjoy being a part of.\nHalls\nwatch\nWarden\nChris Roberts\n\u201cI believe views\nlike that of Saad\nRaja are a perfect\nmicrocosm of\nthe frictions\nbetween the\nwestern and\nMuslim people\u201d\nAdil Hussain\n6 felix Friday 1 December 2006\nomment&\nOpinion\nC\n\u201cIs it fair to\ndifferentiate\nbetween a\nveiled woman\nand a hooded\nbandanaed\nteen?\u201d\n\n"

From immediate with-drawal, to \u201cphased redeployment\u201d,\nbe it phased withdrawal or increase\nof troops, as well as approaches to\nregional diplomatic initiatives to\nsecure the non-interference of regional powers, is being touted as\nthe wise and prescient course.\nLast week, Iran\u2019s supreme leader\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei said during\ntalks with the Iraqi president that\nUStroopsmustleaveIraqifsecurity\nis to be restored. In an efffort to reestablish local diplomatic ties, Iraqi\nPresident Jalal Talabani, visited\nthe neighbouring power as the first\nIraqi head of state to visit Tehran\nin almost four decades. This came\nafter a recent summit meeting between Iraqi President Jalal Talabani and Syrian President Bashar Al\nAssad. In an ironic twist of events,\nit seems that the US is considering to pursue regional security in\nexchange for co-operation from the\nprevious main \u201caxis of evil\u201d powers.\nThis may involve ceasing the threat\nof UN sanctions due to objections\nto Uranium refinement for Iran, as\nwell as losing some heat from the\ninvestigation behind the murder of\nformer Prime Minister Rafik Hariri\nof Lebanon, as well as allegations\noff funding terror.\nIn his recent visit to Pakistan,\nthe Prime Minister Tony Blair was\ndogged by continuing criticism of\nBritish policy in Iraq. His admission that the violence since the fall\nof Saddam Hussein was \u201ca disaster\u201d confirms what many have been\narguing for nearly two years.\nThe claim was made in an interview with the Arabic television station Al-Jazeera in a programme\nhosted by Sir David Frost where\nhe questioned Tony Blair about\nthe West\u2019s intervention in Iraq had\n\u201cso far been pretty much of a disaster\u201d. The Prime Minister replied:\n\u201cIt has, but you see, what I say to\npeople is why is it difficult in Iraq?...\nIt\u2019s not difficult because of some\naccident in planning, it\u2019s difficult\nbecause there\u2019s a deliberate strategy - al-Qaeda with Sunni insurgents on one hand, Iranian-backed\nelements with Shia militias on the\nother - to create a situation in which\nthe will of the majority for peace is\nTrident update\nWhat is the big deal about Trident?\nAs the United Kingdoms sole nuclear deterrent, we have a right to\nmaintain it; to keep it running and\nready to strike. Security is at the\ntop of Britain\u2019s agenda; supporting\nAmerica in a war crumbling at its\nfoundations and seeping into the\nglue that binds together Labour\nhas attracted the worlds \u2018terrorists\u2019, with Bush and Blair the pro-tagonists. And that doesn\u2019t look like\nits going to stop. Blair has already\ninitiated plans for a successor, although information is sparse.\nIn all, the British trident comprises four vanguard class sub-marines, each carrying approximately 48 trident missiles, topped\noff with nuclear warheads. These\ncold war relics occupy the oceans\nin undisclosed locations; a symbol\nof the United Kingdom lurking in\nthe corner of any protagonist\u2019s eye.\nOfficial numbers remain confiden-tial, but conservative estimates\nput Britain\u2019s nuclear arsenal at\naround 200 missiles. Compare that\nto the US arsenal of approximately\n5000 warheads. But then again, the\nAmericans are there to defend the\nworld against derivations of Marx\u2019s\nideology; protecting freedom and\nliberating nations. They need effective weapons and deterrents.\nThis is from a country that has\nsigned the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. America is taking steps\ndisplaced by the will of the minority\nfor war.\u201d\nOpposition MPs, and relatives\nof British soldiers killed since the\n2003 invasion, seized on the comment as evidence that the Prime\nMinister had finally accepted that\nhis strategy in the Middle Eastern\nstate had failed. Such comments fly\nin the face of the many statements\nand remarks, which have been ex-pressed, by both Downing Street\nand the Whitehouse that democracy is working and Iraq will soon be\nin place to take over its security.\nBut a Downing Street spokeswoman insisted Mr Blair did not believe the violence in Iraq had been\na disaster. \u201cHe was simply acknowledging the question in a polite way\nbefore going on to explain his view,\u201d\nshe said. \u201cTo portray it as some\nkind of admission is completely\ndisingenuous.\u201d\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir\nMenzies Campbell said the Prime\nMinister should now apologise for\nhis actions. He added: \u201cAt long last\nthe enormity of the decision to take\nmilitary action against Iraq is being accepted by the Prime Minister. It could hardly be otherwise as\nthe failure of strategy becomes so\nclear.\u201d\nRose Gentle, 42, from Glasgow,\nwhose 19-year-old soldier son Gordon was killed by a roadside bomb\nwhile on patrol in Basra in 2004,\nechoed these criticisms. The moth-er-of-three, a member of Military\nFamilies Against the Iraq War, said:\n\u201cHe\u2019s made a fool of himself and he\nmay have admitted the war was a\ndisaster, but he is still too arrogant\nto take any blame. This war should\nnever have happened anyway.\u201d\nAcross the Atlantic the recent\nseizure of power by the democrats\nof both chambers in the mid-term\nelections is widely seen as a referendum on Bush\u2019s policy of Iraq. In\na post-election news conference,\nGeorge Bush accepted that the voters \u201cregistered their displeasure\u201d\nat the way Iraq had gone wrong.\nThe President mentioned the Iraq\nStudy Group, under his father\u2019s\nSecretary of State James Baker,\nseveral times. He is to meet it soon\nand perhaps was hinting that he\nwill take the Group\u2019s recommendations seriously. Prior to the election defeat the neo-con policy of full\nspectrum domination hollowed out\nthe sound of alternatives, however,\nthe realists have gained prominence with the mid-term victory\nand a new set of policies well may\nbe on the horizon.\nI opened up BBC News today with\nsome interest to discover that\n\u2013 praise be! \u2013 the Creationism lobby are starting a fresh attack on\nthis nation\u2019s education. A group\ngoing along the name of \u201cTruth in\nScience\u201d have been sending out\nteaching packs including a manual\nand two DVD\u2019s (although I bet that\nthey\u2019re nowhere near as good as\n\u2018Casino Royale\u2019) to all secondary\nschools in the country, which contain material promoting intelligent\ndesign as an alternative theory to\nevolution. Worryingly enough, 59\nschools have written back saying\nthat they will teach the material in\nclass.\nIf you have a gander at their website (www.truthinscience.org.uk)\nanyone with any awareness can\nsense that something fishy is going\non. We are told first that Truth in\nScience aims to \u201cpromote good science education in the UK\u201d, with \u201cinitial focus\u2026on the origin of life and\nits diversity\u201d; despite this rationale\nthis phrasing nestles alongside a\nquote calling Darwinism \u201cnihilistic\u2019. (Isn\u2019t this choice of words ironic\nconsidering Darwinism concerns\nthe study of life? Just me then.)\nMoving on to the board of gover-nors, great lengths are undertaken\nto show off the academic background of the governor board; however this board is also host to Willis\nB. Metcalfe (\u201cA businessman with\na long career in agriculture and\npublishing evangelical Christian\nliterature in several languages\u201d),\nMaurice Roberts (\u201cMinister of the\nInverness congregation of the Free\nChurch of Scotland\u201d) and Gerard A.\nChrispin (\u201cdirects Daylight Christian Prison Trust\u201d). I\u2019ll leave you to\nmake your own punch-line here.\nBut it is scientific, really! The\nwebsite also contains \u201cEvidence for\nEvolution\u201d (Nurse! The screens!),\nanalysing such famous cases as\n\u201cDarwin\u2019s Finches\u201d, which offered\nthe following conclusion: \u201cThey\nare a good example of micro-evolution\u2026This study does not give\nevidence for macro-evolution\u201d and\nhow animals came about from \u201csimple single-celled ancestors\u201d. (Read:\n\u201cWe are not monkeys!\u201d) Notice\nhowever they do not link to Darwin\u2019s ideas on how complex organs,\nsuch as eyes, evolved via small\nmutations from simple skin-based\nreceptors barely able to distinguish\ncolours to the massive machine we\nuse to see with today. (Isn\u2019t that\u2019s\nwhy it\u2019s called evolution?)\nHow could the situation have got\nso dire? Surely major politicians\nAttack of the creationists\nto halve its arsenal, but 2500 warheads overshadows that of North\nKorea\u2019s and China\u2019s, countries that\npose threats to America and American allies. The American nuclear\nweapons are a negotiation tool that\ncannot be neglected, arguably used\nto suppress the nuclear ambitions\nof countries like Iran.\nWhy have nuclear weapons in the\nfirst place? For a developing coun-try, they represent a stab at rising\nto the global stage political stage, a\nchance to prove brilliant scientists,\nand an effective internal propaganda tool. The irony is that, in Britain,\nthe nuclear weapons program is\none that is looked on with disdain.\nSo do we actually really need\nTrident? As a symbol that is turning from one of power into one of\ntyranny amid fears of a global \u2018nuclear meltdown\u2019, maybe it is time\nto reassess our nuclear arsenal.\nDo we need a replacement nuclear\ndeterrent once trident, a historical\nrelic, has lived its life? Or is it time\nwe grew out of nuclear weaponry\naltogether?\nI\nam somewhat concerned\nthis week why politics has\ndescended into nothing but\nnukes, religion and war! How\ninteresting it is that after\nthe years of bloodshed in Iraq, the\nBush administration is being diplomatically forced into being helped\nby powers it would rather not deal\nwith. To what extent are leaders of\ndifferent nations to trust each oth-er? In the case of Iraq it seems that\nif it is left on its own, it will either\ntear itself apart from the inside or\nbe torn from an external source.\nIt would be worth the political\nease for the US to give Iran some\nslack and allow monitored uranium processing. No power is more\nresponsible than the next when\nit comes to the power of total global destruction. However, many\nstill view Iran as an untrustworthy\npower, whose views may be neo-expansionist in the immediate region that it can affect. Also, it is not\nknown how destabilised the region\nwill be if any regional power starts\nto abuse its obligations.\nMy hunch is that Iran and Syria\ncould do a damn good job of stopping the immediate blood shed as\nwell as maintaining some regional\nstability. Political tricks, betrayals and assassinations aside, it is\n(unfortunately) better to have all\nthe bickering tyrannical powers involved rather than just one.\nChen Jimeng\nwould have stood up to this sort of\nbaseless meddling? Erm, not quite.\nBoris Johnson (he of floppy-haired\nfame) in responding to a creationist video sent to him called the debate \u2018quite right\u2019 and derided the\n\u201cwider agenda, which seeks to replace the Judeo-Christian beliefs\nthat underpin society with secularism\u201d and is, apparently, a product\nof \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d. Indeed,\nDarwin himself was famous for\nreading the Independent and eating Muesli for breakfast. Even our\ndear leader, Tony Blair, has no beef\nwith the teaching of creationism; in\nan interview he praised a \u2018diverse\nschool system\u2019, which will \u201cdeliver\nbetter results for our children\u201d.\nMy faith (oh, the pun) in the\nsystem is still present mind; as I\nwas wrapping this piece up news\nemerged that Richard Dawkins,\nevery Imperial student\u2019s pin-up, is\nto launch a counter-think tank to\n\u201cPrevent pseudo-science taking\nover in schools\u201d and to subsidise\nbuying of scientific material to be\nused in schools.

    "content": "Following morale boosting performances with 4 wins out of 4 in\nthe first one-day event of London\nWinter League, dD Mixed set off\nto Sussex University and SouthEast Mixed Indoor Regionals with\nhigh hopes, a great set of costumes\nfor the Medieval themed party and\neven a choreographed routine.\nSouthern Trains did their best to\nmake us miss our first game, but a\nsmall scheduling tweak and some\ngood hustle at Lewes station, saw\nthe bulk of the team reinforce the 4\ngirls and one guy who had the foresight to drive. With only 5 minutes\nto change, the first game, against\nnewcomers Chichester, was going\nto be tough. Chichester boasted\nsome experience female GB players and one mature PhD student\nof long experience. The game was\nvery tight, with both teams playing\nhigh tempo man-on-man defense.\ndD relied on the experience of Dirk\nand Stylish to sneak a small lead\nand eventually take the game 5-4.\nThe post match activities saw us\nintroduce the first of our medieval\ngames, Chicken Shoot, where we\nforced one member of the opposition to be the target for one their\nteammates armed with a rubber\nbow and arrow.\nOur next match was against the\nhost university\u2019s second team, Mohawks II, and was another stumble\nonto the pitch affair. The game began with the dD\u2019s taking a comfortable lead; forcing Mohawks to play\ntheir only 3 women whenever pos-sible. Mohawks scored a few points\nlate on, but the game ended 7-3 in\nImperial\u2019s favour.\nOur second medieval game con-sistedofbum-slapfencingwiththree\nplayers picked from each team.\nMohawks managed a moral victory\nwith one of their girls promptly dispatching all our players!\nWith2wins,wewerelookingtowin\nour pool of 4 teams and guarantee\na top 8 finish; in the way stood our\nbitter rivals (and friends), Thrown,\nof Kings College London. The dD\u2019s\nhave never beaten Thrown indoors,\nwhilst Thrown have never beaten\nthe dD\u2019s in outdoor Ultimate.\nOur confidence was high, as\nThrown had just lost to Chichester.\nUnfortunately, whilst our commitment was there, we lacked a tactical plan for dealing with Kings\u2019\nzonal defense. We turned over possession too often and were punished over and over again, the final\nresult being our heaviest loss of the\nweekend at 3-8.\nA three-way tie at the top of our\npool saw us relegated to third and\na lowly seeding of 12th. We still had\na chance of top 8 in the shape of a\ncrossover game against 5th seeds\nUCL. Our fellow Londoners were\nalso fans of the zone defence; this\ntime we were better prepared. The\nopening four points were traded\nevenly, but disaster struck; a couple\nof cheap mistakes gifted UCL a 4-2 lead. This was too much for one\nof players, resulting in a dropped\nkicked bottle and an enforced \u201ccooldown\u201d by our captain who refused\nto be flustered.\nDespite the pressure, dD rallied,\nscoring two quick points and taking possession of the disc in the\nsudden-death overtime point. UCL\nthrew up a wall of 4 players on their\nendzone line, forcing us to patiently\nswing disc from sideline to sideline\nlooking for an opening. Nervous\nminutes past, but Dirk, Mary and\nMadK handled calmly and finally\nforced the opening to take the game\n5-4, securing a place in the top 8\nfor Sunday. The toughness of our\npool was revealed when it turned\nout that Chichester, Thrown and\nourselves secured 4th, 5th and 6th\nseeds respectively, out of 16 teams.\nWith our games complete, we returned to our host\u2019s house for pizza,\na quick round of ring of fire and\nmost importantly our Men in Tights\ncostumes. We had a blast at the\nparty and danced the night away.\nThere were several candidates for\nthe sharking prize, but I\u2019ll mention\nno names, they know who they are.\nSunday morning saw us back in\nSussex, on the pitch for the first\ngame of the day against Royal\nHolloway.\nWith the success of our costumes\nat the party, it was decided to play\nthe day\u2019s game wearing our tights\n(in the case of one player, only his\ntights). A mixture of hangovers,\ntiredness, and their 6\u20197\u2019\u2019 monster\nof a player left us feeling a little\napprehensive at the start of this\ngame. The dD\u2019s used a zone to restrict their star player\u2019s options.\nOur girls all played chase, running\nafter the disc in defense, whilst the\nboys took zonal places further up\nthe field, marking out the area in\nwhich to throw. The tactic worked,\nproducing many turnovers, which\nwe punished ruthlessly, ending the\ngame 15-4.\nHolloway were the first team to\nsee our fully choreographed rou-tine; singing of the main theme\nof Men in Tights, complete with\ncan-can.\nWith a top 6 place secure, we\nwent into our next game, a rematch\nagainst Chichester, with high hopes\nof making the top 4 and qualifying\nfor Mixed Nationals.\nHoping to replicate the success of\nour zonal defense in our last game,\nwe threw it again, hoping to pressu-rise Chichester from the start. The\nfirst point was very long, Chichester held possession, with surprising\nconfidence, eventually finding a gap\nthrough our lines to score.\nOur offence struggled and we\nsoon found ourselves on the wrong\nend of an 8-3 score line. A mini-re-surgence in the last few minutes\nwasn\u2019t enough and we went down\n7-10. The highlight of the game was,\nfresher, Emma scoring; ensuring\nthe whole team had scored over the\nweekend. Chichester went on to finish 3rd.\nWe still had a shot for 4th place,\nvia the 4-5 qualification final, but\nwe needed to beat our bogey team,\nThrown, whom we were to play\nagain. This time, we were better\nprepared, matching their zone with\nour own. The first point was difficult\nwith Thrown going close on two oc-casions, but we turned them over\nand scored.\nThe next three points were traded evenly then Thrown scored two\nquick points, we responded bringing the score back to 4-4. Nerves\nstruck during this point, with both\nteams going close- it was Kings\nwho scored. With just over a minute\nleft, we fought hard and came very\nclose, conceding only in the dying\nseconds with Thrown taking the\ngame 4-6.\nThe weekend ended with dD lying\nin 6th place, representing the best\nindoor finish for Imperial in the last\n3 years.\nUrban Lifestyle\nIn great locations\nFriendly People\nOn hand to help\nStudent Living\nWith your friends\nFIND OUT\nVISIT\nMORE\nWWW.UNITE-STUDENTS.COM\nWWW.UNITE-STUDENTS.COM\nor call 0208 8085445\nor call 0208 8085445\nWWW.UNITE-STUDENTS.COM\nor call 0208 8085445\nCALLING ALL\nSTUDENTS...\nCONSIDER UNITE FOR YOUR\nSTUDENT ACCOMMODATION\nBUT YOU DO YOUR\nOWN LAUNDRY\nIT\u2019S LIKE A\nHOME FROM HOME\ndDs dance because they can-can\nIt began with a passing comment about how comfortable tights can be on cold days and resulted in far too many men in tights\nUltimate Frizbee\nMixed, indoor regionals\nMathias \u201cMadK\u201d Karady\n29\nfelix\nFriday 1 December 2006\nSPORT sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Having beaten the op-position, St Barts 3rds, 12-0 in our\nprevious encounter IC were in a\nconfident mood. So confident that\nBella decided we didn\u2019t really need\nour (fabulous new) keeper, Trish,\nand promptly belted a ball into one\nof the few parts of her body not protected by padding.\nSt Barts, adopted a clever ploy of\narriving late in the vain hope that\nwe\u2019d be so tired and wet by the\ntime the game commenced; giving themselves an outside chance.\nThey overdid the tardiness and arrived over 30 minutes late giving\nIC the opportunity to be granted a\nwalkover. IC\u2019s generous captain, Fi,\nallowed them the dignity of getting\ntheir butts kicked in a fair match.\nThe game commenced with a\nvery intimidated opposition trying\ndesperately to work out how many\nthey had on the pitch and why they\nwere surrounded by a threatening sea of blue and red shirts (we\nhad lots of subs and some fabulous\ncheerleaders a.k.a the mens 3rd\nand 4th teams).

In a match\nwhere IC were too lazy to pull back\nand defend, the defence did well to\nkeep a vicious resistance and the\nball in the attacking half for most of\nthe half.\nAs the teams formed their half\ntime huddles IC had only 1 goal\nunder their belts. The half time\ntalk suggested IC would have to increase their energy, if captain, Fi,\nwere to be kept happy; \u201cWe need\nmore players in their \u2018D\u2019\u201d. \u201cWe\nneed to get back and defend more\nquickly\u201d, \u201cStick to your marker like\nglue\u201d, \u201cWe need more movement;\nlook for spaces\u201d.\nIC emerged for the second half\nenraged by the low score and ready\nfor a slice of goal pie. The defence,\nagain, repelling all of St Bart\u2019s\nmovements towards IC\u2019s goal, with\nBella taking some incredible hit\nouts, one of which found its way\nonto one of the opposition\u2019s knees;\na swift request for ICE followed.\nMala worked hard in midfield, providing a much-needed link between\nattack and defence, even managing\nto hold posotion whilst falling into\na \u2018splits\u2019 position! Trish, in goal,\nintimidated St Bart\u2019s attackers before they even passed the half way\nline- it wasn\u2019t until the last couple\nof minutes that she even touched\nthe ball! Fi, as sweeper, cleared\nevery threatening or wayward ball;\nallowing IC another opportunity to\nattack. The 2nd half was far more\nrewarding for IC with 2 graceful\ngoals from the posts from Mala\nand Melissa. St Bart\u2019s began to\nplay rather viciously in desperation\nwhich led to several minor injuries.\nAmanda scored a 4th with a clever\nmanoeuvre which confused the\ngoalie.

Sponsored and\nrun by Fuller\u2019s, the prize for winning your category is a literal piss\nup at the Fuller\u2019s stag brewery;\nthere was a lot more at stake than\njust pride.\nImperial entered 7 crews, in vari-ouscategories. Thefirstboat;Adam\nFreeman-Pask, Will Laughton, Martin Rogulja and George Whittaker,\nentered in senior 2 quads, won by a\nclear 6 seconds. They beat over 60\nboats including an Oxford Brookes\nboat containing an Olympian and\n3 U23 GB International athletes.\nThis result was a good send off for\nGeorge, who is going to Thailand for\n3 months in the interest of \u2018work\u2019.\nThe second boat entered in the\nsenior 1 coxless fours didn\u2019t fare\nso well; the wrong side of a 6 second deficit. A disappointing row\ncombined with injuries placed Ole\nTietz, Jonty McNuff, Simon Hislop\nand Ben Smith in third.\nICs third boat; Scott Rennie, Dan\nCadoux-Hudson, Rob Manton and\nMark Mearing-Smith, finished 9th\nin senior 2 coxed fours. A respectable result for a line up with a swap\nof sides for Rob and a change of role\nfor Rhino Rennie. IC IV, entered in\nsenior 2 coxless fours was not allowed to race competitively having\nsubstituted out every individual\nfrom the original entered crew- a\nfairly harsh ruling.\nThe women\u2019s top boat was Helen\nEllison, Carlyn Greenhalgh, Kay\nJacks and Cynthia Mynhardt also\ncoming 9th in senior 2 quads, a reasonable result for a tough event.\nThe women\u2019s squad also secured\n4th and 14th place in senior 3 coxed\nfours.\nThe crews decided on a quiet\ndrink in the local pub. This soon\nwent out of the window and the\nsquad descended, en masse, to\nthe London Rowing Club \u2018Jungle\nthemed\u2019 party. Being greeted by\nfake tan smothered men wearing\nthongs is always a good start to a\nnight. Responsible drinking was observed during the unimaginatively\nnamed Strongbow and Bottle of\nRum challenge. Imperial are very\nthankful to London for their \u2018pour\nyour own drink\u2019 policy at the bar.\nThe only casualty of the night being\nOlly Moore, who was outfoxed by a\nloose floorboard, suffering the biggest swollen ankle I\u2019ve ever seen.\n30 felix Friday 1 December 2006\nSPORT sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

The Charm is an unimpressive attempt at repeating the\nsuccess of his first album. But give\ncredit it\u2019s due; Bubba has certainly\nworked hard on this album, even\nwith the soulful The Otherside, a\ncopy-cat of Deliverance; Bubba\ndid try to outwit us with his genius\nand urban farm-boy tales, but it all\nsounds like a plea to embrace hip\nMatty Hoban\nMusic Editor\nI\ndidn\u2019t get much of a reaction\nabout my insensitivity over\nthe death of Feeder\u2019s old\ndrummer. So I can assume\nseveral things: pretty much\nno-one cares about music; pretty\nmuch no-one cares about Feeder;\npretty much no-one reads this\ncolumn and communicating with\nanother human being in any form\nis beyond you. In this case, here\ncomes the lengthiest tirade of\nracism, homophobia and misogyny you\u2019ll ever choose not to read.\nSo if you\u2019re a black, feminist lesbian who is easily shocked, then\nplease scratch out your eyeballs\nnow!\nOnly kidding, I love/hate all\nGod\u2019screaturesinequalamounts.\nWhat to talk about this week I\nwonder. Well, maybe I should talk\nabout myself! You should get to\nknow me, so that if I\u2019m walking\nalong you won\u2019t hesitate to have a\nchat with me. I often walk around\nwaiting for an amazing conversation to eclipse the purpose of my\nwalk in the first place.\nI am from a place in the Midlands called Nottingham, or more\nspecifically a suburb of the city\n(on the southerly edge) called\nWest Bridgford. Nottingham is\noften associated with gun crime,\nbut in my experience of the city\nlate at night, this isn\u2019t completely\ntrue; I have never been shot at,\njust punched a few times. My\nstar-sign is Aries and I would\nsay I am quite passionate about\nthings (including your mother).\nMy favourite music can be described as alternative. This broad\ngenreencompassesmanysounds,\nchords and keys. I like guitars, interesting sounds, crazy and loud\ndrumming. I also like noise; when\nit is used efficiently and with\nprecision it can make more of a\nstatement than anything. I believe that punk is not dead and it\nis not defined as the music made\nby Green Day et al.. Punk is an\nidea of rejection and so much music around now is only a show of\nrejection. I guess politically, I am\nliberal; even though punk ethics\nand ideals inspire me, I am very\npragmatic.\nI enjoy a good book. This does\nnot mean Robert Jordan fantasy\nnovels or Dan Brown; it means\nliterature which challenges your\nperception of the role of literature itself. I am not elitist or a\nsnob, I just hate complacency;\none should not establish one\u2019s\nidentity to be storm-proof, to be\nenlightened by different ideas is\nwhat made humanity progress.\nI am constantly interested in\nnew ideas: superficially in music\nand overall. This may sound like\na lonely hearts column but I genuinely like talking to people about\ninteresting stuff. GSOH. Call me.\nTwo suited and booted Parisian\nDJs glide into their all-too-familiar\nthrone set high above an authentic\nBuenos Aires 10 piece band. Interesting. So what exactly do you get\nwhen you mix the two most sexed\nnations on earth? Intercourse of\ncourse.\nThe first notes from the accordion wash over the crowd like the\nfamiliar first tender kiss of a lover.\nEveryone sighs. It has begun. Cool\nLatino beats and fresh female vocals follow, filling the air with a dirty\nstatic I can only find in a heated\nbedroom.\nFor those who like to close their\neyes from this point in I would say\nthis: you would surely be missing\nout. Buenos Aires skylines, broken\nGauchos and strutting tango dancer visuals glide across the back of\nthe stage in time with an almost\ndub-like step.\nTeasing can only last so long.\nAfter what seems an eternity the\nDJs suddenly make their musical\nentrance. Billie Jean\u2019s bass-line\nfilters through the speakers and\nfinally takes over as musical cen-tre. What follows is a succession of\nshort, sharp, swinging tunes mixing\nthe best of fast-paced Latin dance\nwith warming electronic rock.\nPost-climatic, airy tango brings\nyou down to earth for a breather. As\nusual, the pair then just disappear\nThe Gotan Project\nBrixton Academy\nlive review but only to bring (MOBO award\nwinner) Akala back with them. How\noften does round two happen that\nquickly?\nHowever, this time it seemed like\nthey were just going through the\nmotions. Akala got everyone bouncing but left just that little bit too\nsoon. How frustrating.\nEven the best have their limits\nbut Gotan Project seemed a little\nunder par this time, but everyone is\ndifferent, and this may just be me.\nGeorge Refsum\nhop barn music.\nFair enough, this album does\nhave one or two club-friendly jams\nsuch as Ms New Booty feat. Ying\nYang Twins: an up-tempo, bass-heavy track, produced by Mr Collipark, and a certified stripper\nanthem throughout the nation; or\nHeat It Up, which would truly give\nan extra spring to your butt. This\nalbum seems to have less Timbaland influence than FutureLoveSex\nSounds by \u2018Justin Timberland\u2019. We\nalso have the random Timbaland\nproduction, Hey, an amped-up tune\nbuilt around a sparse marching\nband beat complete with horns and\nchants.\nFolake Adegbohun\nFergie\nFergalicious\n(Polydor)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nsingle review\nFergalicious is the second single\ntaken from the debut album The\nDuchess. Former member of Kids\nIncorporated, Wild Orchid, co-host\nof the TV show Great Pretenders\nand current vocalist of The Black\nEyed Peas. Fergie is to BEP as water is to the Sahara desert.\nFergalicious is an addictive, choc-oholic and sizzling single from Miss\nStacy Ferguson. This is definitely a\ngirl and club banging track and it\ngrows on you; before long one begins to mime to the track.\n\u201cAll the time I turn around\nbrotha's gather round always looking at me up and down looking at\nmy (uuhh)!\u201d This are interesting\nattempts at rapping, but who can\nblame her. Definitely a must have\non your iPod. Another work-out\ntrack, at least at the end of the day\nyou would be as tasty as Fergie.\nFolake Adegbohun\nThe Feeling\nLove It When You Call\n(Island)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nsingle review\nTaken from their debut album\nTwelve Stops and Home, The Feeling\u2019s previous three singles Sewn,\nFill My Little World and Never Be\nLonely have all been top ten hits.\nThis five-piece English band from\nSussex and London have taken it\nupon themselves to reinvent the\ngenre of \u2018pop\u2019 and I\u2019ll be darned if\nthey haven\u2019t done a fantastic job\nat it. With instruments in sync and\nharmonised, and the beautiful vocals from lead singer, Dan Gillespie\nSells, can this band do any wrong\nin our eyes? I think not! With lyrics like \u201cI love it when you call, but\nwhat\u2019s the complication, its only\nconversation, he loves it when you\ncall.\u201d The Feeling does not have a\nfemale fan-base for nothing. With\nlyrics like these any girl would be\nable to relate it too \u2013 you\u2019ll definitely\nbe singing along in no time. But the\nskillfully engineered track is also\nprovides a little something for the\nboys, with notable solos from the\nkeyboards and guitarist.\nFolake Adegbohun\nSome extra pickings for you my friend\nEd Harcourt and friends\nEverythingmustgo\nlive review\nSome gigs are thoroughly crippled\nby their own marketing and just\ncan't live up to their hype. On the\nother hand, some cannot fail to live\nup to their promise \u2013 with little pre-publicity and the name 'An Evening\nwith Ed Harcourt and Friends',\nthere isn't an awful lot left to the\nimagination. Unsurprisingly, the\nevening fulfilled its promises with\nease \u2013 a great many of his friends\nperformed brief sets, every one of\nthem including a duet with the man\nhimself.\nIt was a very informal affair, especially since about half the crowd\nwere performing at various points\nthroughout the evening, performing to a surprisingly small crowd\nthanks to a combination of short\nnotice and an understandable reticence to go out on a Monday night\n(despite the gig being free - Ed).\nAlthough some of the earlier acts\nwere not the most impressive, none\nwere anything less than enjoyable,\nespecially when it camw to Harcourt's duets with each. However, it\nwas after an hour or so of good but\nunmemorable sets that the evening\nreally hit its stride \u2013 Danny Goffey of Supergrass fame performed\na single song from his new solo\nproject, Van Goffey, as his first solo\ngig; David Viner played a stunning\nblues set; and continuing in the\nAmericana vein, Michael J Sheehy\nthen covered The Passenger in a\nmasterful rasping country style.\nThen Sam Herlihy of the much-missed Hope of the States debuted\nhis first new material in months\n\u2013 a fast, rock-oriented number and\na quieter, whimsical piece which\nwas sadly marred by chatter from\nthe bar, before concluding with a\nmajestic duet with Harcourt on a\ncover of Bill Fay's haunting Be Not\nSo Fearful.\nChanging the tone completely,\nJosh T Pearson's set was loud and\nunintelligible, but no less enjoyable,\nbringing down the volume for the\ncompulsory duet at the end. After\ntwo such astounding sets, no-one\nbut Harcourt himself could follow,\nending the evening with a beautiful\nrendering of Until Tomorrow Then\nto a sadly depleted but extremely\nappreciative audience.\nHugh Stickley Mansfield\nThe Gotan Project, Argentinian pimps playing some sexy folk tunes\nDecember Femm\nExpect some tasty reviews, interviews and features on a couple of bands that you might like.\nAlso a feature on the independent media and other goodies.\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n14\n\n"

As a result we turned up for\nour first BUSA encounter greener\nthan we would have liked, with a\nteam where all, but three, had never started for the Virgins before!\nDespite this, and arriving with only\n14 players, we were still fired-up for\nthe challenge ahead.\nKent were a well drilled side; with\na squad of 19, it was a case of sink\nor swim for our 11 Rugby Freshers!\nThankfully they all swam very well.\nThree of our pack were equal to\nthe weight of one of theirs, but IC\nheld thier own in the first half. We\nhad an impeccable defence, tackling furiously, pushing them back\nand making the odd break. IC were\nonly 7-0 down at half time, despite\nbeing a player down, and by no\nmeans out of the game.\nIn the second half their superior\nnumbers and experience showed.\nUntil 60 minutes the score remained 7-0, but as we tired, they\nbrought on all their subs; fresh legs\ngave them the upper hand. Kent\nscored 4 break away tries in quick\nsuccession, IC did not have the legs\nto chase them.\nThe weather deteriorated and\nthe pitch turned into a mud bath,\ntheir forwards weight came into its\nown and they held us in our own 22,\npushing over the try line a further\ntwo further times, both of which\nwhich were converted.\nThe Virgins did not give up, when\nKent thought they had complete\ncontrol, Sam Pemberton, ran in a\nfantastic, team effort, try which was\nthe last play of the match.\nAlthouth IC lost, our freshers\nwere fantastic; managing to hold\noff a much more experienced and\nweighty side for 60 minutes with a\nWe arrived at George\u2019s ground on\na sunny autumn day, expecting to\nbe the less experienced underdogs\nagain; we could not have been more\nwrong!\nIt was their first match of the season and they had barely any tackling practice. Again we were largely\na fresher team and only had 13,\nluckily Georges did too. With two\ninexperienced incomplete sides it\npromised to be a far more evenly\nmatched contest than our previous\nencounter.\nUnfortunately, the referee made\nthe mistake of telling both sides, before the match, that this was his first\ntime refereeing- and it showed.\nWe dominated in the first half; our\nbacks, particularly Sam Pemberton\nand Jess Alcena, took advantage of\nthe holes in their defence and ran in\n3 and 2 tries respectively in the first\nhalf; Sam converting one. When\nthe half time whistle went we had a\ncomfortable lead of 0-25.\nHowever, after the break, they regrouped and scored a quick, break\naway try. IC steadied their nerves\nand a fantastic team effort lead to\na try; involving nearly everyone\nand showing we can support with\nthe best of them. The try was exquisitely finished off by fresher, Theresa Wright, who crossed the line to\nscore her Virgin Try!\nGeorge\u2019s then managed to score\n3 tries, in, what seemed to be, the\nblink of an eye and possibly with the\nhelp of the referee. Fortunately IC\ndid not give up and both Jess and\nSam got another try each before\nthe full time whistle was blown.\nThe best part of the day was yet\nto come, the George\u2019s girls were ex-cellent; providing us with free pizza\nand booze for as long as we could\neat and drink. George\u2019s are by far\nthe nicest bunch of people the Virgins ever had the pleasure to play\nagainst.\nBefore this glorious day which was\nto be the setting for our first home\nmatch I had never heard of Writtle\nCollege.\nWhen they arrived, to our amazement we discovered they were an\nagricultural college from Essex,\nchav farmers I hear you say, but\nthere was no Burberry in sight!\nFor the first time this season we\nhad a full team, as many from the\nolder years came to join our fantastic crew of freshers.\nBeing our first home match of the\nseason we were determined to win\nand we had the perfect start with\nSam Pemberton running in a quick\ntry against the team that size wise it\nwas difficult to distinguish between\nthem and the animals they care for.\nThey did however hit back and bulldozer a try over several members\nof us, and to their credit they used\nwhat they had well.\nThe score did not stay even for\nlong Roxanne Crossley got her Virgin try after a heroic effort by our\nforwards and a break away try each\nfrom Jess Alcena and Sam.\nIn the second half their steamroller technique awarded them three\nfurther tries but our superior speed\nand skill showed and both Jess\nand Sam ran in two further tries a\npiece.\nI very much doubt we will meet\nlarger teams than this for the rest\nof the season and in all honesty\nthis match showed just how much\npotential the Virgins have and how\nformidable we can and will be when\nour freshers have a season under\ntheir belt.\nGKT aka Kings College School of\nMedicine, Dentistry, Physiotherapy,\nBiomedical Sciences, Nursing, Life\nSciences etc, etc, at the campuses\nof Kings, Guys and St Thomas\u2019 Hospitals may have the longest official\nname for, well, anything in history,\nbut bless them since they arrived\nwith only 11 players after being broken the previous Wednesday and\neven before kick off their attitude\ngave us a hint as to why. We had 16\nplayers but they would not concede\nand play a friendly so we played\nunder protest knowing full well we\nwould get the 3 points and it gave us\na chance to play some of our least\nexperienced freshers with the pressure slightly off.\nSaying this, we had no intention\nof losing and once again a quick try\nfrom Sam Pemberton showed we\nmeant business. We did however\nnot bargain for the well quite frankly viciousness and dirty tactics from\nmany of the GKT players.\nWith punching, kicking and biting\nthey managed to even the score at\n22-22 at half time, there was a great\nVirgin try from Kasey as well as 3\nmore tries and a conversion from\nSam.\nThe second half was slightly less\nlike a one sided boxing match than\nthe first and as much as much as it\npains me to admit they rucked very\nwell and the teams were only separated by a conversion.\nGKT went 22-29 up and were still\ncelebrating their conversion when\nSam ran in a quick try which soon\nshut them up. Unfortunately we did\nnot manage to kick to following conversion and they emerged eventual\n\u2018winners\u2019.\nI have never played in such an\nill tempered unsportsmanlike like\nmatch and I\u2019m very proud to say\nwe did not sink to their level and\ndespite the score we can hold our\nheads up high.\nSports results from\n22nd November\nBadminton:\nMens 1st\nOxford 1st\nMens 2nd\nQueen Mary 1st\nWomens 1st\nHertfordshire 1st\nBasketball:\nMens 1st\nBedfordshire 1st\nFencing:\nMens 1st\nSussex 1st\nWomens 1st\nReading 1st\nFootball:\nMens 1st\nSt Marys 2nd\nMens 4th\nRoyal Holloway 4th\nMens 6th\nUniversity of the Arts 1st\nMens 7th\nRoyal Free 4th\nHockey:\nMens 1st\nImperial Medicals 1st\nMens 2nd\nLSE 2nd\nMens 3rd\nRoyal Free 2nd\nMens 4th\nBrunel 3rd\nWomens 1st\nBrunel 1st\nWomens 2nd\nSt Barts 3rd\nLacrosse:\nWomens 1st\nKings College 1st\nNetball\nWomens 1st\nBucks Chilterns 1st\nWomens 2nd\nSt Georges 3rd\nRugby:\nMens 1st\nReading 1st\nMens 2nd\nReading 3rd\nMens 3rd\nRoyal Holloway 2nd\nSquash:\nMens 1st\nEssex 1st\nMens 2nd\nCity University 1st\nMens 3rd\nLSE 2nd\nWomens 1st\nLSE 1st\nTennis:\nMens 1st\nLSE 2nd\nWomens 1st\nBrighton 1st\n3\n5\n1\n7\n3\n5\n88\n91\n135\n103\n135\n77\n1\n1\n4\n6\n1\n3\n2\n2\n6\n4\n11\n0\n2\n1\n0\n4\n1\n3\n4\n0\n3\n9\n27\n21\n12\n36\n0\n22\n0\n5\n0\n77\n0\n5\n3\n0\n1\n2\n3\n1\n10\n0\n10\n0\nWith thanks to our sponsors:\n31\nfelix\nFriday 1 December 2006\nSPORT sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Scientific journalism is \u201cboring\u201d\nDoes science in the media over-hype its results too much and has the real meaning of research been lost?\nColin Barras\nBen Goldacre, the Guardian\u2019s Bad\nScience columnist, is unhappy.\nWe know because he told us so, at\ngreat length, in that newspaper\nlast year. The science reported in\nthe media is \u201csimplistic, boring, or\njust plain wrong.\u201d Journalists gloss\nover the scientific method behind\nnew research (too boring) and instead choose to over-emphasise the\n\u2018groundbreaking\u2019 conclusions. This\nisn\u2019t how it was supposed to be! But\nare Goldacre\u2019s concerns substanti-ated, or is his complaint no more\nthan a sanctimonious rant at the\nreporters who fight to spread the\nword of science? I spent a week behind the Times (and the Independent and Guardian newspapers) to\nfind out.\nWho better to ask for an assessment of science journalism than the\nscientists whose work is reported?\n\u201cWherever the press folks interviewed the involved scientists and\ntried to present a balanced view,\nthe coverage was decent,\u201d Professor Swaroop, of the University of\nMichigan, told me. He was referring\nto the media response to a paper he\nco-authored that appeared in Nature early in November. That paper\ndetailed the successful transplantation of precursor cells into the\ndamaged retina of a blind mouse.\nThe precursor cells integrated and\ndeveloped within the damaged reti-na. To put it crudely, the procedure\nallowed blind mice to regain their\nvision.\nI\u2019m not a cell biologist, and until\nreading this research I didn\u2019t know\nthat \u2018precursor cells\u2019 are slightly\nmore advanced than \u2018stem cells\u2019.\nI doubt that the science journalists at the Times, Independent and\nGuardian were aware of this distinction either. But all of these writers recognised that this distinction\nwas crucial to the researcher\u2019s success (because earlier attempts to\nintegrate stem cells into the damaged retina were unsuccessful). It\u2019s\nbecause I read these newspaper reports that I now know what a \u2018precursor cell\u2019 is.\nGoldacre suggests that science\njournalists choose to dispense with\njust this kind of information in favour of over-promoting the implications of the research. \u201cSome of\nwhat I saw was\u2026hype,\u201d admits\nProfessor Swaroop. But from which\nquarter did this hype issue? \u201cWe\nare now confident that this is the\navenue to pursue to uncover ways\nof restoring vision to thousands\nwho have lost their sight,\u201d said Dr\nRobert MacLaren, one of Professor\nSwaroop\u2019s colleagues, in the Guardian. In that article, the voice of caution came from outside the science\ncommunity: \u201cIt is important not to\nraise the hopes of people who have\nlost their sight until the results of\nhuman trials become available,\u201d\nsaid a RNIB spokeswoman.\nIn fact, while scientists are keen\nto distance themselves from hype,\nmost realise that a little hype can\nbe a good thing. In the 1980s, interferon was hailed in the media as a\nmiracle cure for cancer. When the\nNew York Times began to publish\nreports that were more cautious\nabout its efficacy, it was criticised\nby scientists who felt that such reporting could undermine public\nsupport for interferon research.\nVOLUNTEERS NEEDED!\nWhy not get active in the community whilst you\u2019re at\nImperial College London?

Perhaps Goldacre fears\nthat scientific investigation of this\ncalibre damages the public image\nof science.\nBut the reality of the situation is\nthat the public image of science is\nin no need of protection. There\u2019s\nplenty of evidence that science is\ntrusted and respected. And it\u2019s the\njournalists, the source of Goldacre\u2019s ire, who do most to encourage this respect. Alok Jha writes\nin the Guardian, the same paper in\nwhich Goldacre vented his spleen.\nJha is a journalist who fights for\nscience rather than against it: \u201cThe\nbiggest threat to science doesn\u2019t\ncome from\u2026the extremist who\nburns down farms in solidarity with\nresearch animals. It comes from\nthose [in Government] who claim\nto respect the way science creates\nknowledge, but who misinterpret,\ndistort or ignore that knowledge.\u201d\nIt\u2019s disingenuous for Goldacre to\nignore the positive effects that the\nmedia reporting of science can\nbring.\nAlthough Goldacre likes to imagine that scientists are misrepresented in the media, many scien-tists, including Goldacre himself,\nare regularly given column inches\nto peddle their own agenda. Writing\nin the Times, Dr Stephen Minger, director of the stem cell laboratory at\nKings College London, put the case\nfor his own research programme:\n\u201cWe are not mad scientists trying\nto play God, just scientists seeking\na solution to the problem of creating cloned embryonic stem cells by\n\u2018therapeutic cloning\u2019. This, we hope,\nwill lead to new treatments for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases.\u201d\nThis brings to mind the words of\nNeal Lane, former director of the\nNational Science Foundation: \u201cScientists [must] sell themselves to\nthe public to ensure that science\nretains both public support and the\nfunding that goes with it.\u201d This was\nclearly Dr Minger\u2019s motivation too.\nAfter making the case for the necessity of his research programme,\nhe\u2019s quick to remind us, the public,\nthat the success of his research depends on successful grant applications to the HFEA.\nIt should be clear that the manner in which science is reported in\nthe press is far more complex than\nGoldacre suggests. So, how best\nto interpret Goldacre\u2019s polemic?\nParadoxically, it is perhaps that po-lemic, and not science journalism,\nthat is \u201csimplistic, boring [and] just\nplain wrong.\u201d\nAre these perfect comedy faces?\nIs science portrayed as too\n\u201cbonkers\u201d in the media today?\n\n"

John Collins, Union\nPresident, told Felix that the Rector believed that this would \u201cdilute\nthe College\u2019s brand\u201d.\nAt the Rector\u2019s forum on Wednesday, the issue was raised by the\nmembers of the Executive. Sir Richard, appearing to be somewhat\nfrustrated with the matter, made\nthe generous offer when it pointed\nout that a lone student running for\nthe College would never be able\nto make the same amount of money from sponsorship that Trevor\nPhilips could, simply saying: \u201cI\u2019ll\ngive them \u00a310,000, then.\u201d\nThere are three Centenary\nprojects currently under consideration for receiving money during\nIC\u2019s funding drive to celebrate the\n100th anniversary of the founding of\nthe College. These are the Central\nLibrary redevelopment, student\nhardship funds, and the Beit masterplan (for redeveloping the Union buildings). It seems likely that\nthe money from the Rector will be\nfunneled into the student hardship\nfunds.\nThe Rector\u2019s first forum with the\nExecutive also led Sir Richard to\nmake one of his trademark outspoken statements; in this case, it concerned the possibility of removing\nthe cap on top-up fees. Sir Richard\nspoke strongly against it, saying:\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take the cap off, that\u2019s an\nabsolute nonsense. You can\u2019t allow\n145 institutions to charge what they\nlike, that would be a disaster.\u201d\nSir Richard proposed a different\nfunding model, arguing as he has\ndone many times in the past that\nthe most able students should have\na chance to attend well-funded\n\u2018elite\u2019 universities, saying that a\nstudent achieving good grades and\ngaining a place at a top university\nshould trigger full funding for that\nstudent\u2019s education \u2013 he called this\n\u201ca damn good investment\u201d. Sir Richard focussed on the funding situation for the top universities, implying the development of a multi-tier\nsystem of higher education that already exists in some countries.\nWith the debate about top-up\nfees due to be reignited, and with\nthe recent affiliation referendum\nmeaning the Union will be joining\nthe NUS whose policy on top-up\nfees has moved to being against\nremoval of the cap rather than the\nabolition of fees, students may find\nit reassuring that Sir Richard appears to be on their side.\nDiscussing police\ntactics post-7/7\nThe Union\u2019s Chaplaincy arranged a meeting between members of\nthe Metropolitan Police, the Police Authority and representatives\nfrom the Muslim community. The police were interested in being\nable to hear the views of students on the policing of London in\nthe wake of the Tube bombings last July.

After a quick one hour drive\nand supermarket stop we arrived at\nour local downhill and cross country spot ready for a full day\u2019s riding.\nLuckily the heavens hadn\u2019t opened\nup the day before like the weather\nman said they would, so most of the\ntracks were dry and ready for some\nmud-free riding.\nThere are a multitude of downhill\ntracks at Aston hill as well as a fairly good cross country course and\nwe set out doing all of them except\nthe cross country.\nMy favourite was the 4X track\nwith big burrs and smooth ramps\nwhich then leads into the bottom\nhalf of DH3, another very good run.\nThere were no major injures except to our egos, with Kofi \u201cthe flying man\u201d Danso doing as his nickname suggests and leaving his bike\nbehind, landing on his knees at the\nbottom of the same drop twice, and\nJames \u201ctopple over\u201d Atteck not being able to get his feet out of the\nclip pedals fast enough and keeling\nover at the starting blocks of the 4X\ntrack in front of a group of 12 year\nolds.

Roxy was off due to a ball being smacked into her hand, so IC\nwere a man down as we have no\nsubs, according to our coach the\nhalftime should have gone when\nthey managed to sneak one past\nus. The 2nd was stopped by Debs\non the line & the umpire called it\nover even though three IC players\nclearly saw it didn\u2019t.\nDespite this controversy and yet\nanother defeat our team left the\npitch smiling.

    "content": "Night of A-Muse-ment at Wembley\nThose crazy classic-rock-raping, nu-prog-rocking West Country bumpkins play at the Wembley Arena\n\u201cWhen the conspiracies unwind,\nwill you slam shut or free your\nmind?\u201d Lead vocalist Matthew\nBellamy soars above the collective\nshouts of the many thousands in\nWembley Arena during the mind-melting track that is Exo-Politics;\nsimultaneously bursting the ultrasound barrier with his incredible\nvoice range and cryptic lyrics and\nbreaking down the walls with his\nambitious, sumptuous guitar riffs.\nMuse are back in London, and\nare certainly nothing but the supermassive band millions have regarded them as ever since their modern\nclassic, Origin of Symmetry, burst\nonto the music scene back in 2001.\nAfter a strangely poor opening act\nnamed The Noisettes, involving a\nlead vocalist that insisted on doing canine impressions (and at one\npoint actually squealing so loudly\nmost of the audience covered their\nears in distress), thousands were\neven more desperate for what they\ncame for. The wait was intense; all\neyes were on the stage. Suddenly,\nthe lights dimmed, and the background music faded into nothing.\nThey had arrived.\nTake A Bow opened, and instantly\nthe crowd surged forwards, crushing everyone and everything within\nreach: the screams, the shouts, the\ncries of joy and pain all culminated\nwhen the three progressive rockers\n(Ugh, prog-rock, I feel dirty \u2013 Ed)\nwere illuminated by eerie lighting originating from all manner\nof strange, almost hallucinogenic\nlarge contrivances.\nInitially playing the entirety of\ntheir latest album, Black Holes and\nRevelations, in the track order, you\nmight have thought that nothing\nwould have come as a surprise to\nthe dedicated progressive rock fan\nin the audience.\nMuse, consisting of lead vocalist and guitarist Matthew Bellamy,\nbassist Chris Wolstenholme, and\ndrummer Dominic Howard, are\nwell known for their energetic live\nperformances, but this is surely the\nunderstatement of the millennium:\nenergetic does not do this live performance justice in the slightest.\nPersonally, I was astonished at\nthe astounding quality of each and\nevery song I had the pleasure of\ncascading around the arena to. Every single track was far superior to\nthe album version equivalent, and\nbeing an award-winning album of\nsymphonic, melodious excellence,\nthis is certainly saying something.\nSupermassive Black Hole was,\nsimply, the zenith of contemporary guitar rock music; a brilliantly\ncatchy riff and a guitar solo second-to-none. The vast amount of violent\nhead-banging, passionate air-guitar\nplaying and the animated, synchronized escalations of members of the\naudience proved so overwhelmingly mind-bending that the bizarre,\nhypnotic lighting effects made little\nlive review\nMuse\nWembley Arena\nROBIN ANDREWS\ndifference to the state of thousands\nof psyches.\nTime is Running Out, perhaps\none of Muse\u2019s most famous tracks\nfrom their Absolution album, again\nsuperseded the album version con-siderably. The eclectic drum-work\nof Dominic Howard launched this\npiece of apocalyptic-themed music into orbit; complete strangers,\nseparated from their own compan-ions, suddenly put arms around\nshoulders and cried into the night:\n\u201cWe can\u2019t push it underground/we\ncan\u2019t stop it screaming out/how did\nit come to this?\u201d\nSure enough, nothing was stopping the enthusiastic, elated Muse\nfans from transforming Wembley\nArena into the most vibrant mosh-pit environment I have ever experi-enced. When the metallic Assassin\nmade its debut, several large rings\nwere formed on the arena floor, and\nas the guitar riffs suddenly hit home\ntens of people leapt into each other,\nresulting in numerous concussions\nand multiple injuries; I was quite\nstunned to see a body fly past me\nand impact the floor moments later,\nonly to rapidly recover and rejoin\nthe melee.\nPerhaps the greatest highlight of\nthe night was the spaghetti-west-ern styled album closer Knights\nof Cydonia. Following on from the\nemotional, piano-driven performance of Hoodoo, this burst into life\nalong with thousands of members of\nthe audience; even those in the socalled seating areas \u2013 all of whom\nhad long begun to attempt to be as\npreposterously insane as those in\nthe standing area \u2013 could not resist\nleaping over chairs and copying my\noutstandingly good air guitar skills.\nThe guitar solo at the end of the\ntrack, which has become something of a legend among Muse fans,\nwas so perfectly played by Matthew Bellamy, and backed up by the\nheavy-duty bass-lines of Chris Wolstenholme, that no-one, and I mean\nno-one, could control themselves.\nDuring the two-minute closing se-quence, I accosted two complete\nstrangers and demonstrated my\nimmaculate yet imaginary guitar\nskills whilst blaring the lyrics in\ntheir general direction; within seconds they accepted this strange,\noverexcited entry into their lives\nand did exactly the same thing, only\nto realize they had been doing this\nalready for quite a long time.\nDrenched in various liquids of\nunknown origin, Muse continued\nto fulfil the audience\u2019s hopes and\ndreams by playing a host of older\nMuse tracks, including Plug In\nBaby, their cover of Feeling Good,\nHysteria, Sunburn, New Born and\nBliss, the latter of which was accompanied by large, suspiciously\ngelatinous balloons which, in comparison to the mysterious concentration of \u201cHappy 18th Birthday\u201d\nballoons and inflated contraceptives drifting around the arena floor\nprior to Muse\u2019s entry, proved far\nmore appeasing.\nStockholm Syndrome was chosen as the closer; the antithesis to\nexit music chosen for most gigs of\nthis magnitude, which tend to opt\nfor more slowly-paced, emotive\ntracks. Muse\u2019s closing number was\na monstrously virulent track, with\nits pounding bass-lines, sonorant\ndrumming and absolutely electrifying guitar riffs propelling the crowd\ninto a different musical dimension.\nThis was pure, explosive guitar-flavoured energy; there was nothing moving about this track, unless\nof course one refers to the physical\ndisplacement we all experienced;\neven more so than that of Supermassive Black Hole. I found out\nfirst hand just how successfully\na few of us in unison could propel\nourselves towards the ceiling whilst\nblaring out the memorable chorus\ntime and time again.\nLeaving this gig just barely intact\nand positively buzzing with energy,\nI was unexpectedly hit by the tinge\nof disappointment. There were\nso many tracks Muse could have\nplayed, but opted not to, including\nthe 1984-esque Citizen Erased, arguably their most epic track. I could\nnot help pondering on why this, and\nother Muse \u2018classics\u2019, including\nButterflies & Hurricanes, Falling\nDown, Apocalypse Please, Falling Away With You, Megalomania\nwere not played.\nHowever, shortly afterwards, the\nanswer dawned on me: almost every Muse track is deemed a classic\nby the millions of fans spread across\nthe world, and there simply isn\u2019t\nenough time to showcase them all\nin a two-hour slot. The ideal Muse\nfan\u2019s gig would simply be for the\nband to play every single song they\nhave composed, no matter how long\nit took to perform. Megalomania,\nthe closer to Origin of Symmetry,\nreplaces religion with music, and\ncould easily be compared to reality.\nMany bands have a large following,\nbut I can say without the slightest\ndoubt that the following of Muse\nborders on the religious.\nDespite whatever bias may arise\nfrom being this obsessive with the\nprogressive rockers\u2019 (So, so dirty -Ed) musical talents, I can think of\nno better way of putting this: Muse\nare undeniably the best of their\nkind, and their live performance\nnot only demonstrates this, but sets\nthe standard for hundreds of bands\naround the world today.\nRobin Andrews\nROBIN ANDREWS\nMatt Bellamy (on a bad hair day) riffing it up for all the progsters\nHuge, big testicles floating around... erm, yeah, too obvious\neviews\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n13\nfelix\nFriday 1 December 2006\nR\n\n"

    "content": "LSE students halt talk by BP chief\nA public lecture by Peter Sutherland, Chairman of BP and future Chairman of LSE, was halted by students\nangry over his appointment as LSE Chairman and alleged human rights abuses by Mr Sutherland\u2019s companies\nDavid Ellis\nNews Editor\nLSEstudentshaltedapubliclecture\nto be given by Peter Sutherland, the\nChairman of BP\n, Chairman of Goldman Sachs and UN Special Representative for Migration.\nMr. Sutherland was due to deliver\na lecture on \u201cEurope\u2019s Place in the\nWorld in the 21st Century\u201d. Just\nas the event was about to begin 15\nstudents from LSE entered the hall\nand sat on the stage. They carried\nbanners drawing attention to alleged environmental and human\nrights abuses of Mr. Sutherland.\nThe students obstructed Mr.\nSutherland on his way to the podium and declared that they would\nstay until LSE held a student-wide\nreferendum. Both LSE and Mr.\nSutherland declined, and the event\nwas promptly moved to a different\nvenue. Student press and protestors were prevented from entering\nthe new venue by LSE security,\nwhilst Police and Community Support Officers removed protestors.\nThe anti-Sutherland camp claims\nthat in his position as Chairman of\nBP\n, Mr. Sutherland has been responsible for environmental and human\nrights abuses. These are said to include the Prudhoe Bay Alaskan Oil\nSpill, where BP spilled 265,000 oil\nbarrels after being fined in 2002 for\nillegally failing to install a leak detection system promptly; the BakuTbilisi-Cehyan (BTC) Oil Pipeline,\nwhere BP\u2019s contracts have overridden social and environmental\nlegislation and undermined human\nrights and similar infractions concerning pipelines in West Papua,\nColombia and the North Sea.\nThe LSE Council comprises of lay,\nacademic and student members,\nall of whom are elected to their\npositions. Its task is described as\n\u2018overall determination of strategy\u2019\nat LSE. The role of the Court of\nGovernors is to receive reports\nfrom the Council and the Director,\nto appoint Directors of the School\nand discuss major issues on the development of the school.\nThe student campaign against\nMr. Sutherlands appointment began after student governors raised\nobjections at the Court of Governors meeting that ratified the ap-pointment. Despite the objections\nraised a unanimous vote, in which\nstudent governors were allowed to\nvote, ushered Mr. Sutherland into\nthe Court in March 2006. A statement from LSE said: \u201cThe Court of\nGovernors approved Peter Sutherland\u2019s appointment as chair in 2008\nby acclamation. Student representatives were on the Selection Committee, the Council and the Court,\nand consulted throughout.\n\u201cMany LSE governors or Council\nmembers are involved with other\nprivate and public businesses or\norganisations, and would often\ndeclare an interest to colleagues,\nbut are still, of course, able to offer their views on whatever subject\nmight arise.\u201d\nMr. Sutherland is expected to take\nover as Chairman in January 2008.\nA term as Chairman lasts three\nyears after which a second term is\npossible. The current Chair, Lord\nGrabiner, has been exceptional in\nthe position and has therefore been\ngranted three terms. His third\nterm is due to end in December\n2007 when Peter Sutherland shall\nsucceed him.\nHoward Davies, Director of LSE,\nsaid:\u201cMyacademiccolleaguesandI\nare delighted that Peter Sutherland\nhas agreed to join us and, in time,\nto take on the Chairmanship of the\nSchool. His background in public\npolicy and his business and international interests match the LSE\u2019s\nprofile remarkably well. We look\nforward to the School continuing to\nprosper under his leadership.\u201d\nA petition was started immediately after the appointment was made\npublic and prominent student representatives voiced concerns. The\nprotestors aim to force Mr. Sutherland to decline the Chair.\nA spokesperson for the students\nsaid: \u201cMany students are dismayed\nat this appointment and there is a\nbroad coalition that want to make it\nclear that we do not want someone\nwith Sutherland\u2019s abysmal track\nrecord of human rights and environmental abuses to be the figurehead of our university.\nLSE is famed for it\u2019s commitment\nto social justice and human rights\nand this appointment contradicts\nour founding aims and ethos. LSE\nstudents protested over the appointment of a director associated\nwith racial segregation in the 1960\u2019s\nso similarly we are now protesting\nagainst someone associated with\nenvironmental degradation and human rights abuses.\u201d\nMr. Sutherland also has a formidable reputation in business; he\nhas previously held the positions\nof Competition Commissioner for\nthe EU and Director General of the\nWorld Trade Organisation. Some\nstudents fear this will adopt a pro-business stance including measures such as raising the cap on tuition fees.\nA student spokesperson said:\n\u201cWe also see it as another clear indication that the School is embracing an increasingly marketised perspective and increase tuition fees\neven more. Our aim was to make it\nclear to Sutherland and the School\nthat students oppose his appointment and the way it was made, given that LSE has not listened to us.\nThe appointment was railroaded\nthrough without any acknowledgement of our concerns. Tonight we\nforced them to listen to us and we\nhope they will take notice.\u201d\nJames Caspell, a student representative on LSE Council said:\n\u201cLSE used to be the home of social\ndemocracy, whereas now its business links are getting stronger and\nthis sends a negative message to\nstudents who have not yet applied\nbut are put off by LSE\u2019s increasingly marketised approach to social\nsciences.\u201d\nStudents from LSE climb on the stage, interrupting the lecture\nPolice were called, who swiftly removed the protestors\nBabar Ahmed loses fight to avoid extradiction\nFormer IC staff member loses final appeal against his extradiction to the US for \u201crunning terrorist websites\u201d\nSupporters of Babar Ahmed protesting in Central London\nAndy Sykes\nA former employee of the College\nhas lost his legal fight to avoid being extradicted to the US on terror\ncharges.\nBabar Ahmed, who worked in Mechanical Engineering, was arrested\nin August 2004 on charges of setting\nup and administering websites that\nwere allegedly used to raise money to train Taleban fighters and\nChechen rebels, as well as printing\nmaterial that praised \u2018holy war\u2019 and\nincited murder.\nMr Ahmed\u2019s supporters claim\nthat after being arrested, he was\n\u201cbrutally assaulted\u201d by officers\nfrom the Metropolitan Police, and\nwas later released without charge.\nThey also criticise the current ex-tradiction treaty between the UK\nand the US that allows the US to\nrequest extradiction of a person in\nUK custody without the need to prevent the available evidence to a UK\ncourt for consideration. A number\nof British civil rights groups have\nalso attacked the treaty for similar\nreasons.\nMr Ahmed\u2019s appeal was rejected\non the grounds that it could not be\nproved that he would be treated unfairly should he be extradicted to\nthe US. There has been widespread\noutcry at the US government\u2019s\nuse of \u201cextraordinary rendition\u201d\nand allegations of torture authorised by officials within Bush\u2019s\nadministration.\nHis case was ruled on at the same\ntime as that of Haroon Aswat, who\nhas been accused of setting up a\ncamp to train terrorists to fight\nin Afghanistan. He has also been\nlinked by US authorities to the infamous radical cleric, Abu Hamza.\nUS officials claim that the two plotted to set up what they call a \u201cjihad training camp\u201d in the state of\nOregon.\nThe only legal route left for Mr\nAhmed, Mr Aswat and their supporters is to appeal to the House\nof Lords. The judges ruling on the\ncase are currently sitting to discuss whether this appeal will be\nallowed.\nThe Union currently has a policy\nof supporting Mr Ahmed, passed\nat Council in December 2004 under\ncontroversial circumstances and\nallegations of intimidation.\n3\nfelix\nFriday 1 December 2006\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

I\u2019m sure you would have\nreceived e-mails about this, but I\nwould just like to make it known that\nSamuel Lynas did not approach the\nIslamic Society at all when writing\nhis article.\nAs we were not even given the\nopportunity of answering his questions it would seem that Mr Lynas\nset out to write an unbalanced article from the start.\nThis may be standard practice\nfor certain types of newspaper, but\nI would like to think that the student newspaper of one of the best\nuniversities in the world could do\nslightly better. Indeed, there are\nplenty of opportunities on campus\nto talk to your average Muslim and\nfind out what we believe, and what\nour views and opinions are on current affairs as well as history. The\nIslamic Society and all its events\nare open to everyone.\nWe have our Friday prayer and\nsermon in the Union Building at\nlunchtime. Our prayer room is at\nthe basement of 9 Prince\u2019s Gardens. Just before the prayer room\nwe have a \u2018doss room\u2019 where we sit,\nchill and discuss things.\nIf Samuel Lynas really wants to\n\u201cask questions\u201d, perhaps he should\nactually talk to the Islamic Society,\nor even e-mail us, and ask those\nquestions. That would enable him to\nwrite a balanced article. To write an\narticle insinuating that the Islamic\nSociety is extremist seems a very\nDear Andy,\nI have read the article on the Islamic website. I read it for what it was:\na piece of historical information\nconcerning the life of a competent\nleader and general.\nI would like to thank Samuel\nLynas for making me go to the\nwebsite and read the article under\ncontention. While I was doing so, I\nread a few other articles on Islamic\nhistory and was amazed to find a\ntotally alien aspect to Islam and its\ndevelopment throughout history.\nIt made me realize how far it is\nfrom being the \u201cpsychotic deathcult\u201d that the modern media has\nconvinced people like Mr Lynas to\nbelieve.\nThank you, Islamic Society, for\nputting such articles of history on\nyour website. They may be biased\nbut that\u2019s better than having hundreds of clubs and societies with no\nplace to find such historical information coming from a voice within\nImperial College students.\nWhile you\u2019re at it, Mr Lynas, next\ntime you go to Trafalgar Square to\nvisit all the statues of British gener-als, please write an article on how\nsome people (like you) can be foolish enough to think that the statues\nare a celebration of violence and\nmass slaughter.\nRegards,\nZirgham Afridi\nGuildsheet, the\nNUS campaigns\nand fools\nDear Andy,\nIn the article titled \u201cNUS farce continues\u201d (Felix 1364), it is stated that\nthe Returning Officer for the NUS\nReferendum, Jon Matthews, was\n\u201capproached by the \u2018Yes\u2019 campaign\nwith concerns over conspiracy in\nthe ranks of the \u2018No\u2019 campaign\u201d. It\nis mentioned that the leader of the\n\u2018No\u2019 campaign is the President of\nthe same faculty union that published the offending paper, presumably implying that the CGCU\nPresident could have influenced\nGuildsheet editor\u2019s behaviour. Is\nthis the same \u2018Yes\u2019 campaign who\ncan name amongst their ranks a\nperson who was not only, as your\nnewspaper reminds us, Guildsheet\neditor, but also a former CGCU\nPresident and Chairman himself?\nIn fact, it almost seems to me that\nthe only position that this former\nCGCU barbershop quartet singer\nhas never achieved within said union is that of Welfare Officer, having\nbeen defeated way back when.\nIt must be pretty galling for the\npro-NUS group not to have thought\nof advertising in Guildsheet despite\nhaving such an illustrious veteran\nof CGCU and Union politics. It all\njust sounds like sour grapes from\nthe joiN-US group.\nRegards,\nTim Hoult\nMech Eng IV\nPS In case it\u2019s assumed this is an\nattack on the \u2018Yes\u2019 campaign by a\nfervent \u2018No\u2019 man, I\u2019d hasten to add\nthat it must be equally degrading\nfor a political movement to resort\nto naming themselves after the\nopening at the lower end of the alimentary canal in a vain attempt to\ndisturb the student body out of their\npolitical apathy and vote.\nWhy is the\nlibrary incredibly\nhot in winter?\nDear Andy,\nCan you please explain to me why,\nwhilst sitting at a computer on the\nsecond floor of the Central Library\nin a t-shirt on a cold winter\u2019s day,\nI am dripping with sweat? It\u2019s not\nbecause of an essay deadline, I can\nassure you! Am I really the only\nperson at Imperial who finds the\ntemperature of the Library faintly\nridiculous?\nIt\u2019s certainly not conducive to\nwork! As a leading scientific institution shouldn\u2019t we be setting an\nexample by saving energy? Is there\nno environmental policy that we\nshould be abiding by? More perti-nently, can\u2019t we design buildings\nwith windows?\nWhy is it so f**king hot? I\u2019d carry\non with the rage but this heat is\nsending me to sleep; a potential\nreason for the apathy around cam-pus, perhaps?\nYours, clammy and \u2018orrible,\nDarryl Croft\nAndy Sykes replies,\nThe library has been a roasting\noven for a number of years; as\nlong as I can remember, anyway.\nA quick straw poll of the Felix office seems to suggest that Level 5\nof the library is so hot because a)\nthe College is conducting secret\nexperiments on xenomorphs and\nrequires tropical conditions to ensure the creatures\u2019 wellbeing, b)\nthat there\u2019s a gateway to hell in the\nfar cubicle of the gent\u2019s toilets, and\ndespite the librarians\u2019 best efforts\nto counter the ancient evil, it still\nheats the surrounding air to several hundred degrees, or c) the library is built on an Indian\u2026 sorry,\nNative American burial ground.\nstrange way of asking questions,\nespecially considering the fact that\nthe Islamic Society is within such\neasy reach.\nLynas says, \u201cI admit that it is unsettling to ask these questions.\u201d No,\nSamuel, we\u2019re used to them. \u201cBut it\nis suicidal not to ask them.\u201d So why\ndidn\u2019t he ask us?\nYours faithfully,\nMohammed Marikar\nICU Islamic Society\nMillions of pilgrims descend on Mecca; every able-bodied Muslim is supposed to travel to Mecca once\nSamuel Lynas replies,\nMr. Afridi\u2019s guess about the provenance of my low opinion of Islam\nis sadly mistaken. Does he really\nbelieve that the only reason Islam\ngenerates more antipathy and\nfear than Buddhism is some unexplained media bias? Would that it\nwere!\nAs for Mr. Marikar\u2019s puzzlement\nthat I failed to pose these questions\ndirectly to the Islamic Society, I\nmust inform him that they were\nnot addressed to the Islamic Society. Rather, they were addressed to\nthose non-Muslims who are starting to wake up to the danger that\nIslam represents to this country\nbut have, as yet, an unclear grasp\nof the magnitude of the problem.\nI flattered myself that the Muslim response to my article was\nsomething I could predict, and Mr\nRaja\u2019s article in last week\u2019s Felix\ndid nothing to disabuse me of this\nnotion. It is a perfect example of\nMuslim apologism, and makes my\npoint for me quite succinctly. Perhaps next week Mr. Raja could explain away the millenia of slaugh-ter, enslavement, rape, pillage, and\ngenocide committed by Muslims in\nthe Indian sub-continent, Africa,\nSpain, the Balkans, the Middle\nEast, Turkey, Central Asia, and the\nMediterranean Basin. The more\npeople like him write, the less people like me need to.\nIn closing, let me say how encouraging it is that the stigma\npreviously attached to criticism\nof Islam, the religion of peace, tol-erance, and fluffy animals, has\ndisappeared so completely. As\nthe Muslim population of the UK\ngrows, it will become bolder still in\nits insistence that we must adopt\nthe dictates of a mentally ill 7th-century Arabian merchant. Pointed criticisms of this totalitarian\npolitical system masquerading as\na religion are more necessary than\never. Long may they continue.\nAny excuse to print this picture again; the impounding of Guildsheet\nL\n\n"

I also promised I wouldn\u2019t\nweigh in on the argument about Islam that\u2019s\nbeen raging within these very pages for the\nlast few weeks. I lied.\nMy position, to clarify, is that of the true atheist. I do\nnot believe in any form of supernatural power, whether\nit be the fartherly God of the Christians or the God-increation of the Deists like the Founding Fathers.\nThe truth is that you cannot argue with the religious.\nAll religion is based on a set of axioms; for the non-tech-nical (hah!) among you, these are unproveable rules\nwhose truth you take for granted. These axioms are laid\ndown in the holy texts, and all religious observance is\nderived from them. Atheists, on the other hand, have a\ntotally different set of axioms, from which they derive\ntheir \u2018life rules\u2019 in a similar fashion. Without a common\nset of axioms, you cannot argue with another person, as\nyou will always strike the bedrock of each other\u2019s argu-ments: the unproveable axioms.\nThe only way you can argue is if you choose to temporarily accept one another\u2019s axioms for the duration of\nthe argument. That way, you can argue about the deriving of religious observance or \u2018life rules\u2019 with a common\nground. And herein lies the rub; those with religious\nbelief will often refuse to accept another\u2019s axioms, even\ntemporarily, because they the added weight of the \u201cdivine word\u201d behind them. In other words, because the\naxioms are taken directly from the holy texts, which\nare reckoned to be word of God, the axioms cannot be\nwrong, and so to discard them would be sheer fallacy.\nI\u2019m not saying atheists are much better in this respect;\nsome of the more militant anti-religionists would believe\ntheir axioms, though again unproveable, are completely\ncorrect.\nHence, the argument is nearly always completely\nmeaningless. Alex, the Managing Editor, says that I\u2019m\nbeing way too logical about it all, and reducing everything to derivations and axioms in a meaningless fash-ion. I disagree, though you may not. That is all I\u2019ll say\non the matter, as I have no specific problem with Islam\nany more than I have problems with every religion that\nproports to be \u2018the real truth\u2019.\nLastly, I do support the recent rumblings to reverse\nthe smoking ban, at least in the Union bar. Those of you\nthat know me outside this rag may realise that\u2019s for\nselfish reasons, but I think it prevents a happy medium\nbetween, on one hand, those that wish to eat without\nbreathing fag ash, and those that crave nicotine.\nAnd with that, I\u2019m off to bemoan my personal troubles\nin the bar over a pint (oh, the fairer sex and their borderline psychopathic nature). Have a nice week.\nFun with John and Ron\n\u201cWow, John! New tills at the Union! It\u2019s\nabout time they ditched those archaic\nmachines. I mean, manually adding up\ndrinks prices?! That\u2019s so risky; what\nif they don\u2019t carry the one? And talk\nabout slow. Imperial College students\nshouldn\u2019t be expected to cope with that\nmuch pressure; what if someone orders a round? Of different beverages?!\nGod forbid they throw a pie or packet of\nnuts in that order as well. How will they\ncope?\u201d\n\u201cI know, Ron, me old mate \u201cone-forthe-road-skip\u201d! Let\u2019s replace them with\ncomputers. Ones that run off Windows.\nWe can\u2019t do that? Not technologically viable to replace humans with robots just\nyet? Fiddlesticks. How\u2019s about buying\nsome EPoS tills? Yeah that will make\neverything a lot better. I mean, adding up drinks prices in your head how\n2005.\u201d\n\u201cGreat idea John, have you used one\nbefore? Oh well, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find\nsomeone who has. Instead of adding\nprices up in their head they could make\nthe customers wait whilst they trawl\nthrough multiple menu pages to find\nthe drink they want then punch it in.\nMilitary precision! Why didn\u2019t I think of\nthis before? But how long do you think\nthe customers would have to wait? We\nhave to justify the \u00a320k price tag.\u201d\n\u201cGee wizz, you\u2019re right. Well how\u2019s\nabout we give the bar plenty of time to\ntrain their staff in their use over sum-mer? That way when the freshers move\nin on Saturday 30 September 2006 it will\nall be ready to use!\u201d exclaims John.\n\u201cSo the Friday before then?\u201d asks\nRon.\n\u201cSounds good. What do you think Ted,\nmy prize winning pigeon?\u201d\n\u201c*SQUAWK*\u201d responds Ted.\n\u201cSo it is agreed, John, we\u2019ll make\nFelix presents you with part of an exchange between our favourite\ncomedy duo and their beautiful prize-winning pigeon known as Ted\nthem use these tills. That will improve\n\u2018stuff\u2019 around the bar. But what if it\ncrashes; isn\u2019t a Windows based system\nunstable?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Ron, my slap-headed friend, Windows will never crash. I mean, come on,\nwhat do you expect? That the till in the\nUnion bar will crash 15 minutes before\nthe close of service on the first night the\nfreshers arrive? Don\u2019t be silly, or else I\nwill have to take your army toys away.\u201d\n\u201cPlease, John, anything but that. I\nwanna play soldiers some more. But\nhow can we justify the vast spending?\nDo we have this sort of money?\u201d\n\u201cIndubitably, my good man. We\u2019ll just\nget rid of some of the fat from here or\nthere. Or we can offer them less pay.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean demote them?\u201d\n\u201cNo Ron! Bad, bad Ron! We don\u2019t\nuse that word here. Its not a demotion.\nWe\u2019ll offer them the job as part of the\nongoing \u201cUnion Restructuring\u201d to better serve the students and get my name\nmentioned.\u201d\n\u201c*SQUAWK*\u201d Ted interrupts.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that, Ted?\u201d asks John. \u201cYou\nthink that some of the bar staff might\nbe upset about that? The old managers\nwere the best thing the bar had going\nfor it? Ha! I have a steel pot in the union bar. That makes me better than any\nmanager.\u201d\n\u201cToo true and silly buggers, John!\nBesides, they aren\u2019t allowed to have\nan opinion. It says so in the staff-stu-dent protocol. Why, just the other day\nI humiliated one of the serfs whilst he\nwas trying to change the TV station. I\nowned him! Yeeeeeeeeah!\u201d\n\u201cErr Ron, you might want to put your\nshirt back on; it\u2019s only midday, after all.\nWe\u2019ll get to that later. But you may be\nright, Ted, my dear feral pigeon. We\ndon\u2019t want the part time staff revolting\nLast week I had the pleasure of entertaining my cousin. It\u2019s always nice to\nhear from family and I was delighted\nto receive a call from him asking if i\u2019d\nlike to meet him for a drink in our Union\nonce his meeting was finished. Catching up with him over a few beers should\nhave been the perfect way to end what\nhad been a very stressful week. All was\nwell until he reached into his pocket\nand produced a packet of cigarettes. I\nrecoiled in horror. \u201cYou can\u2019t smoke in\nhere\u201d I shrieked as he struck a match. I\nwent on to inform him that if he wished\nto smoke he would have to leave the\nbuilding.\nHe exclaimed \u201cWhat? Thats absolutely bonkers! I\u2019ve been working hard all\nday and now you\u2019re saying that im not\nallowed a fag to accompany my pint?\nFelix says: \u201cBring back smoking!\u201d\nStephen Brown\nComment Editor\nIt\u2019s bad enough back home in Scotland\nthat they wont let me light up anywhere.\nI\u2019d expect that people at a prestigious\ninstitution such as Imperial to have a\nslighly more enlightened view. What\nsort of wankers run this place?\u201d\nI went on to explain that last year Union Council voted to ban smoking and\nthen followed up with some mutterings\nabout \u201chealth Nazis\u201d and \u201cnannying.\u201d\n\u201cAh Mr Brown, you\u2019re just another angry smoker who thinks it\u2019s acceptable\nto belch out your poisonous fumes,\u201d I\nhear you cry. Not true, im afraid. You\ncould probably count the number of\ncigarettes i\u2019ve smoked in my entire life\nwithout taking your socks off. Aside\nfrom the libertarian argument about\nit being unfitting for our elected \u201crulers\u201d to pass judgement on our personal\nhabits, the reason that I am in wholehearted agreement with my nicotine\naddicted cousin was summed up that\nFriday evening, its just plain annoying.\nI find it very frustrating that every\ntime im out with my friends that some\nof them keep buggering off to feed their\naddiction. I am fully aware that there\nmay be dangers associated with sitting\nwith smokers. Life is all about taking\ncalculated risks. Given the somewhat\nflimsy evidence as to the effects of passive smoking I have decided that although it may not be good for me I think\nthat having some decent, uninterrupted banter with my mates is a benefit\nwhich outweighs the negative effects.\nIm prepared to set aside my dislike of\ninhaling second hand smoke in return\nfor not having to see some of my friends\nleave the table at regular intervals. In\nshort, the ban disrupts the atmosphere\nand detracts from a good night out. The\npoint is that it should be my choice as\nto how seriously I take the scaremon-gering from health fascists, not anyone\nelses.\nAt the end of the day people are voting with their feet. The Queens Arms\nhave been doing a roaring trade ever\nsince ICU banned smoking. Where are\nall the hordes of oh-so disgusted nonsmokers who didn\u2019t previously attend\nto make up for the lost custom? Most of\nthe people who use the bars would still\ngo regardless but a minority have been\ndriven out as a result of mindless political persecution.\nSome might argue that even if we\nscrap the ban it wont make much difference as the government have plans\nfor a nationwide ban. I\u2019ve not read very\nmuch on this proposal recently so i\u2019d be\nprepared to wager that it is not one of\ntheir pressing priorities and is destined\nfor the long grass. Felix wants to scrap\nthe ban to end the harassment of a minority of our students. I know smoking\nis a bit minging, but I would rather go\nto the pub with the addicts as they\u2019re a\nhell of a lot more fun than people who\nsupport these illiberal measures.\nFelix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB.
