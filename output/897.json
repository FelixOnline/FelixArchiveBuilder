    "content": "Felix Editor: Adam Harrington\nAs Editor of Felix, one of the best student\nnewspapers in the country, I intend to\nlias e with other London colleges to\nproduce an integrated view of all news\nrelevant to Imperial students. In addition,\nI would like to encourage students of St.\nMary's to get more involved in contributing to Felix, and by so doing\nincrease the publication's relevance to\nthem.\nThough much of Felix is of a high\nquality, there is still room for change.\nThere is a lot of potential for effective\nand readable use of English, building on the already high standard set in previous\nyears.\nMore prominence should be given to\nnews, and an increase in coverage can be\nmade by introducing more people to\nreporting. News should be impartial and\naccurate, and reporters should not be\nmisled by obdurate bureaucrats.\nThere are many cases where students\nhave been victims of this college's complacency, inefficiency or carelessness.\nStudents often feel they can't overcome it\nbecause of fear for their degree and the\nbelief that they would be ignored. Felix\ncan exert pressure on behalf of students\nagainst the Union or the College when either behave invidiously.\nFelix has long been known for the\nquality of its arts reviews. This should be\ncontinued and encouraged as it is an\nimportant service to students. I would like\nto compile a weekly list of activities\noutside the college in addition to this.\nIn the knowledge that I cannot be\naware of all the needs of IC students I would always be open to suggestion from\nanybody as to how the publication could\nbe improved. It would be a positive\nbenefit that such suggestions come from\noutside the group of volunteers working on Felix.\nPresident: Michael Newman\nAt twenty seven years of age Michael\nNewman has done more than most\npeople do in a lifetime.\nHe obtained his degree in Zoology in1986. During his undergraduate years, at\nImperial, he was best known for his\nactive role in the debating society and\nH.G. Wells Soc, & for his organisation of\nbig name speaker meetings.\nMichael organised a pressure group,\ncampaigning for women's health issues,\nwhich gained the support of over 100\nM.P.'s. He chaired the groups press\nconference, held in the House of\nCommons, at which M.P.'s from all parties\nspoke.\nHe has taken leave from his job as a school teacher to study for an MSc in the\n'History of Science' here at Imperial.\nAs a school teacher in Bradford he\nChemistry and Biology.\nHe was the first teacher on a DTI\nenterprise scheme and has received\nsubstantial funds from industry for school\nactivities he has designed. At present he\nis making a video about schools and\nindustry which will be supplied to all\nschools in Bradford.\nMichael's achievements led to him\nbeing appointed as public relations officer\nfor his school despite his young age.\nMichael Newman has clearly shown he\nis capable of putting original ideas into\npractise and I therefore feel he will make\nan excellent Union President.\nIam standing because Iam an idealist.\nWhen I plan a project and put it into\neffect I do so not only with short term,\nreal is able objectives but with a well-defined philosophical aim. This aim not\nonly motivates me it gives direction,\ncoherence and a reason to the things I do.\nAs President I will NOT be a management trainee seeing success as\nmerely keeping things efficiently running.\nI will introduce sweeping changes into\nour Union and college. See my CUT DUE TO THE SUBMITTED DOCUMENT BEING OVER THE300 WORD LIMIT.\nPresident: Adrian Johnson\nThe Proposer's bit\nErr, Rob's proposing me( or at least he\nsaid he would when I asked him half an hour ago), and as he is an ex-RSM\nPresident, I think that says something (it\nsays he's very tall). Rob has known me for a number of years and thinks I'm jolly\nwiz zo and groovy, but he's far too busy\nto lower himself to write this sort of crap.\nSo, Rob says 'Vote for Jelly'.\nThe Candidates Bit\nBastard features Rowe has only left me with about 239 words, so, less waffle!\nReform the college day I say! But do it\nproperly: Lectures start- at midnight so\nyou can go down the bat first and get a few beers and a swift curry in. Or you can go to a gig or a film and go into\nyour lecture feeling good - after all, who feels positive and ready to learn at 9.30\nam. Also, you can get a tube in when it's not busy, get one home in the early\nmorning when it's not busy, and you don't have to feel guilty about spending\nthe afternoon down the pub/ watching\n'Neighbours' etc, because you're not\nmissing any lectures. And a special\nmessage to all you whizz-kid bread heads in Finance in Sherfieldall the electricity we're gonna use is dead\ncheap at that time in the morning.\nSo, vote for me and change the college\nday into the college night - you know it\nmakes sense (well, the Physics students in the flat above you are always running\naround at four in the morning, aren't they ?).\nNo Photo Submitted\n\n"

    "content": "Hon Sec (Events): Steve Farrant\nOver the last year, the Union has started\nto head in a new direction. More\nemphasis is placed on the areas that the\nstudents want from the Union. The\nsabbaticals need to be up to the challenge\nof providing these services and I believe Iam the ideal candidate for Honorary Secretary.\nWith the Peachtree survey, many new\nideas will arise. This means more funding\nwill be needed and the union becomes\nmore business like. However, certain\ntraditional aspects of the union need be\nstood by and the students shouldn't be\nmade to pay for the changes required.\nAs Honorary Secretary, I would try to\nraise part of this money through external\nroom bookings and facilities for outside\nevents (ie. the Proms over the summer).\nWithin college there are several areas\nwhere the Honorary Secretary is\ninvolved.\nEnts events would be publicised at St.\nMary's, Silwood and South Kensington\nand Mini-busses provided between sites.\nHaving been Rag Chairman, I know how\nRag works and what needs to be done. A shorter Rag Week with the best events\nand a larger Rag Fete are to be\norganised. More external publicity would\nbe used to promote the work and improve the image of Rag and other\nstudent activities.\nSCAB would also be heavily publicised\nin all of the college media, with the\ncooperation of the SCAB Chairman and\nthe Publicity Officer.\nNew events should be organised, PostGrad events, working with the PGA O and\nan Overseas Week( similar to Arts Week),\nworking with the OSC Chairman and\neach OS C Club.\nTo hear the rest (space is limited) come\nand have a chat, in the Union Office at\nlunch times, the bar at most other times\nor the Hustings UG Ms. Vote for Steve Farrant for ICU Honorary\nSecretary (Events).\nAll Posts: New Election\nNo Manifesto Submitted\nEditorial\nVote!( or you could be sorry)\nHustings: St Mary's Today, 6.00pm, Mary's Union Bar\n: Imperial - 7th March, 6.30pm JCR\nFelix is produced for and on behalf of the Imperial College Union Publications^o ard and is printed by\nthe Imperial College Union Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London Sw7 2BB( Tel 071-225 XbTZ).\nEditor: Andrew Butcher, Manager: Chris Stapleton, Business Manager: Jeremy Burnell.\nCopyright Felix 1991.

    "content": "President: Zoe Hellinger\nZoe's four years spent at I.C. have seen\nher heavily involved in the Union from\nday one. With SCAB in the varied scenes\nof Sound Director and Stage director of\nDramsoc, and as Administrator and\nTechnical Coordinator of Theatre West\nEnd has overseen the success of \"The\nbest student venue on the Fringe\". All this culminating in her becoming SCAB Chairman this year where she has sat on\nand contributed valuable discussion to\nmany of the Union's committees. Her\nenthusiasm and aptitude to get on with people, especially the Union Permanent\nstaff, will be a great asset to her work as\nUnion President.\nZoe's personality, dedication and ability\nto motivate people easily makes her the\nbest choice out of all the Presidential\nCandidates to pull this Union together,\nput students interests first, and make sure\nthis Union is run to the benefit of all.\nJeremy Burnell. (FELIX Business\nManager.)\nThe Union needs to be more accessible to\nall students. With this in mind, my first\ntask will be to create a more inviting and\nhelpful atmosphere in the Union Office.\nThere are many changes planned for the\ncollege careers service with no\nconsultation with the student body. My top priority will be to get student\nrepresentation here and to ensure that no\nchanges involve a lowering of the service\nstandards.\nSt Mary's are an autonomous body and\nin my view they should stay that way.\nGenerally, my experience\nadministrating Theatre West End will be a great advantage in the administrative part\nof the job. In working with TWE's clients,\nawkward members of the public and the\npress, I know I can negotiate well on\nbehalf of the students in order to give\nthem the best chance of gaining a complete and rewarding education while\nthey're here.\nVote Zoe Hellinger.\nPresident: Spenser Lane\nSpenser has been a student at Imperial\nfor four years (UG+PG), and has been an\nactive member of ICU in previous years.\nHe has attended numerous committees\nranging from UFC to House. Currently, he\nis S CC Chairman, its important\nresponsibilities including the\nrepresentation of nearly 2000 students,\nthat are members of social clubs, to ICU\nCouncil and U GM. He is a fair and good-humour ed person with a positive attitude,\nand will stick to the issue at hand. He has\nalways been firmly committed to\nachieving the best deals for students.\nThe most important student issue in\nrecent history is about to hit us ie\nderegulation (better known as voluntary\nmembership of your student union). In\nless than 5 years, the union's got to be\nself-sufficient, and are we ready. No way!!\nIn addition, students have got no time to\nget involved. They have got too much to\ndo now without bothering to attend\nlengthy meetings on trivial matters.\nTherefore my plans include:\n1 - Keeping the bureaucracy to the\nminimum( eg meetings kept short, sweet,\nand to the point).\n2 - A firm commitment to campaign for\nmore autonomy to the CCUs/MSCs. This\nextra responsibility will allow them to run\ntheir business with little needless\nhinder ance from the Union structure.\n3 - Much much better representation for\nthe overseas and postgraduate students.\nThese people are the most likely to leave\nafter deregulation.\n4 - Seek better industrial sponsorship now\nbefore the other student unions start\nqueuing for those limited resources.\nImperial has a reputation with industry\nwhich College milks, so why don't we?\n5 - Start organising plans to renovate the\nunion building (a pet hate is the state of\nthe union toilets. They need renovation\nnow!)\nI INTEND TO BRING THE UNION TO THE STUDENT! Deputy President: Jonathan Griffiths\nThe position of the Deputy President in\nIC Union is not one of de put ising for the\nPresident, but one of fiscal responsibility\nfor all the Union's assets.\nI don't believe anyone at IC can have\nas much professional experience as I have to deal with all the trading outlets,\nas well as the needs of the CC Us and the\nMSCs within college. Before coming to\nImperial, I was self-employed, owning a coffee bar and two quality greengrocers,\nover a period of five years. My entry into\nretailing was self-motivating and without\noutside help. After five successful years I decided I needed a change of direction,\nso I embarked on a trail which led to\nImperial. Here, I have been involved with\nthe financial management of many\nsocieties culminating in becoming SCC\nTreasurer. This has seen me sit on UFC, as well as attending Council.\nMy vision for the next year is to see all\nthe Union's trading outlets operating\nprofitably, and after studying their\naccounts this seems perfectly feasible.\nThis surplus would then be ploughed\nback into the Union to provide better\nservices, a better environment and the\nbest location for social ising. My first\nproject would be to turn the Union\nDining Hall into a waitress- service\nrestaurant serving fay re to satisfy all\npalates at affordable prices.\nI believe that this refurbishment and\nexpansionist policy is the only way\nforward. It's how my shops survived and grew during the Miner's Strike. With the\npossibility in the near future of all student\nunions having to be self-financing, this is\nsurely the best way to move forward.\nFor a student who would treat his\nposition as a profession, for a student\nwho wants to work for you, for a student\nwith experience VOTE J.D. GRIFFITHS 1\n\n"
