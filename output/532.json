Since\nthen they have taken part in most of these\nactivities, though fortunately, no national\ndisasters have occured. But mainly in\nconnection with helping the sick, the elderly\nand the handicapped.\nThe IC detachment now numbers thirty\npeople, and in the past it has been\ninstrumental in training no less than one\nhundred and twenty-five people in the\nCollege in first aid and nursing. They were\nalso very much involved with the reception of\nalmost three hundred and fifty Vietnamese\nboat people at Kensington Barracks in\nNovember of last year when they provided\nsome of the V ADs( Voluntary Aid Detachments) necessary for the first aid and\nnursing services at the centre.\nIn his speech Lord Flowers thanked all J. he\nstudents who were involved in the raising of\nthe \u00a35,300 that was put towards buying ana\nequipping the ambulance. Last year, the\nremaining \u00a32,500 coming from other funds to\nwhich he had access. He then presented Lady\nHylton Foster, President of the London\nbranch of the Red Cross and the society with\nthe key.\nPhoto by Colin Palmer\nLord Flowers being shown round the Ambulance\nPhoto by Colin Palmer\nRED CROSS MEMBERS GROUP\nAnyone interested in giving help (BSc First Aid not necessary)\neither occasionally or regularly please come along to the ICCAG\nroom, top floor Union building, 12:30 today or next Friday (lunch\nand coffee provided).\nAt the moment we have several people visiting geriatric or\npsychiatric wards at St Mary Abbots Hospital with which further\nhelp is needed. Also people are needed to help with security at a fund raising fair this Tuesday afternoon at Kensington Town Hall.\nGood with children? Someone is needed to help with a Junior Red\nCross Group on Monday evenings at 6:30pm at the Kensington and\nChelsea Red Cross centre on Old Church Street. The children are\nall ages up to sixteen and are said to like going out a lot. Try it for a week or two if interested and see if its your cup of tea.\nI also need a bigger pool of people for escorts accompanying old\nand infirm people from London across the country making sure\nthey get to their destinations unharmed and not a nervous wreck.\nAlso there is a possibility of helping at a Handicapped Children's Adventure Playground locally.\nFor further details come to a meeting or contact me: Simon Chandler, Maths2.

    "content": "LETTERS\nPAGE\nMORE\nLETTERS\nON PAGE 4\n\"DEMOCRACY MEANS\nALLOWING EVERYONE\nTO HAVE THEIR SAY\"\nDear S;' Malcolm Brain's letter in last\nweek's FELIX, about the last UGM\nhas fi n ally d;ive n me to put pen to\npaper.\nMr Brain's appalling excuses for\nmoving that my amendment\nshould not be put must be refuted.\nHe claims his procedural motion\nwas not undemocratic, yet the\nconvention is for the chairman to\nreject such procedural motions\n(unless there is a good reason to\nnot do so). I remember Mr Brain,\nas last year's UGM chairman,\nrejecting such procedural\nmotions (quite rightly). However,\nMick Berry, the chairman, was\nquick to accept the procedural\nmotion. I shall come to Mr Berry's actions at the UGM later.\nMr Brain claims there was\ninsufficient time to discuss the\namendment and anyway the\nprocedural motion was passed by\na large majority. If, however, there\nwas enough time to discuss a silly\nmotion about occupying the\nHouses of Parliament with the aid\nof the BBC, then there certainly\nshould have been enough time to\ndiscuss my amendment, which\nwas at least serious. The 'Houses\nof Parliament' amendment hardly\ngot a single vote, after\ndiscuss sion. How can Mr Brain\nclaim that his procedural motion\nwas not undemocratic if he\nprevented any discussion on the\namendment (aided and abetted by\nMr Berry). Why don't we then vote\non everything without a single\nspeech, and finish the UGM\nquickly. Democracy, Mr Brain, if\nyou don't know the meaning of the\nword, means allowing everyone to\nhave their say. Anyway, there\nwere still almost four hundred\npeople there at 2:45, which shows\nhow important people felt about\nthe motion. So clearly there was\nno worry about time.\nNow for Mr Berry. After the\ndefeat of the third amendment, I asked to make the final speech\nagainst the main motion. Up to\nthat point no speech against the\nmain motion had been made. But\ndid Mr Berry allow this speech?\nNO! He just pretended there was\nnothing in standing orders about\nit, and forced the meeting to the\nvote. But standing orders clearly\nstate that there must be one\nspeech from each side before\ntaking the vote.\nCertain as I was of this fact,\nunfortunately I did not have my\ncopy of standing orders, so I didn't have time to verify it. Mr\nBerry's actions are to be deplored\nand the next UGM deserves an\napology. And this from a person\nwho announced himself as the\nmost impartial person in ICU at\nthe first UGM.\nThus Messrs Berry and Brain\nmanaged to railroad this stupid\nand worthless occupation through the U GM, stifling\nopposition where they could. All\nvery 'democratic' Mr Brain?\ni have the honour to be sir,\nShlomo M Godsi\n\"LET THE MUGS DO IT99\nDear No-longer-acting Editor (if I may now refer to you as that)\nRegarding the correspondence\non the Rag Mag. Although I voted\nat the recent UGM to ban this, I should like to contribute a few\nwords in Steve Marshall's defence.\nSteve's error, common to Rag\nMag editors of all colleges and\nyears is to fail to realise the\nacceptability of a certain type of\nhumour amongst the public.\nAlthough you or I might find jokes\nabout dead babies merely\ndistasteful, some people might be\nvery upset. In short, Steve\nprojected his tastes onto\neveryone else in the world.\nBut what has not been said in\nFELIX is that this publication was\nthe result of a lot of work by Steve\nMarshall and his staff, which\nseems only to be appreciated by\nthose of us wh t have worked on or\nwith union publications. We must\napplaud and support those people\nwho give their time to our society\nin any unselfish way - all who work\nfor Rag, the union officers,\nNightline, ICCAG, etc, etc. Too\nmany people sit on their\nbacksides and say, \"Let the mugs\ndo it.\" Along with many of your\ncorrespondents, I am not keen on\nsit-ins; but I agreed with the\nmotives'of those who followed the\nPresident's recommended course\nof action. I note that four\nthousand IC students were too\napathetic to even attend the\nmeeting. These are the people\nwho should be criticized in these\ncolumns, not those who actually\ndid something which they thought\nto be constructive.\nSo to Steve Marshall, the only\nman who would take on the Rag\nMag and now the only one\ninterested in editing the Phoenix:\nmore power to your wrist! And to\nthe Union: I hope you can get a few more people off their\nbacksides this year!\nYours in not too much over 200\nwords\nDERRICK\nEVERETT\nit\nENTS STRUGGLE ON\"\nDear Sir\nWe were very sorry to read the\ncomments expressed by Mike\nSpeight and Jim Cantle in the\nFELIX edition of 26 October. It's a pity that such sentiments have\nbeen uttered by student members\nof the college who are supposed\nto support the struggle of the\nENTS committee to bring discos,\nfilms and groups to IC, in spite of\ncontinuous GLC opposition. We\nbelieve that under the prevailing\nclimate at Imperial, we should all\nbe grateful that there are any gigs\nat all. The very fact that there is\ncompetition in London as is\nmentioned in the letter, requires\nus to pay groups London prices\nand therefore charge more since\nthere is no additional revenue\napart from tickets. (A pub staging\na band can afford to lose on the\ntickets because it overprices the\ndrinks - or haven't Messrs Speight\nand Cantle noticed this?)\nFurthermore, we would like to\nremind our critics that less than\nfour weeks ago, we brought Jane\nAire and the Belvederes to\nCollege, FREE, and that on 10\nNovember, we are offering two\ngroups, Between Pictures and the\nMartian Schoolgirls at an advance\nticket price of 75p( something\narranged before the letter was\npublished). We would like to finish\nby saying that everyone is free\nand welcome to join the\ncommittee and actively participate in its functions. Join us first\nand sack us later, if you want!\nENTS\nCOMMITTEE\nDear Sir\nI feel I must reply to two letters\nwhich have appeared in FELIX\nrecently, the arguments of which\nrely on a premise which is totally\nfalse. I am referring to the letters\nfrom Richard Wormsley (FELIX 19\nOctooer) and the reply from\nRobert Wilson (FELIX 26\nOctober). Mr Wormsley, in a totally ridiculous statement\nblatantly claims that the present\ngovernment was \"elected by a huge majority\". What a complete\nlie! I might remind him that at the\nlast election the Tory party gained\nless than 45% of the votes cast.\nSome huge majority! And I believe\nMr Wormsley is studying maths l What I think Mr Wormsley was\ntrying to say was that the Tory\nparty was given upon a plate, by a totally unfair electoral system, a large majority of MPs in the House\nof Commons false and\ncompletely artificial majority\nwhich did not accurately reflect\nthe true feelings of the electorate.\nA reply to the above letter from\nRobert Wilson falls into the same\ntrap. Mr Wilson states that a mandate of any size does not\nallow policies to go unquestioned.\nBut there is no mandate, just a purely artificial one created by an\noutdated system which is a disgrace to the country. Only a system using proportional\nrepresentation truly reflects the\nfeelings of the electorate in the\nnumber of MPs of each party\nelected.\nYours faithfully\nChristopher J Spencer\nPhysics 1\n2\n\n"

    "content": "The film stars Peter O 'Toole as Lord Chelmsford, who is trying to gain\nprestige by conquering the Zulus. He has previously starred in\n'Lawrence of Arabia', 'Goodbye Mr Chips' and.'How to Steal a Million'.\nBurt Lancaster plays Colonel AW Durnford, a hardened officer who has\nbeen in Africa for seventeen years. Lancaster's many film credits\ninclude 'The Train' and 'Birdman of Alcatraz'. Sid Birtle Frere, the high\ncommissioner is played by John Mills, well-known for his roles in 'Oh\nWhat a Lovely War', 'Young Winston' and 'The Thirty Nine Steps'.\nThe film leaves one with the feeling that it is quite good, but only\nbecause there are no major faults to criticize. Being based closely on\nfact, the film is almost a documentary; it doesn't dwell on the characters\nof the people. There is a bit of tension, but no satisfactory climax,\ndespite the moderately lavish budget. The film lacks personal feelings,\nbut not action. The acting is brilliant, especially Peter O 'Toole who\noffsets the background of the hopelessness of the war to good effect.\nLancaster and Mills play their parts well, but the script allows them to\nput virtually no character into the people they were portraying. It\nseemed like a lot of little boys sharing their skills and running off to war\nwith no depth of feeling.\nTechnically, the film was quite well produced but there was some\nmisleading perspective in the run-up to tbe battle sc en ces, when it\nseemed that the two armies were closer than they really were.\nIt is, however, an enjoyable film, ideal for educating twelve year olds\non the Boer Wars or even for providing entertainment for IC students.\nR&B EXTRAVAGANZA\nELECTRIC BALLROOM\nFive bands for \u00a32.50, what an evening it\npromised to be. I arrived early, intending to\ndrink some beer and get a good place near\nthe front. First on stage were the Bogey Boys,\nwho sounded like an Irish George Thorogood, and played a superb version of\nJJ Cale's 'Cocaine'.\nNext were Red Beans and Rice, with a singer who sounded very much like Wilson\nPickett, and played soul music the way it used\nto be played before disco came along anc\nscrewed it up. The guitarist of the Little\nRoosters used to be in Cock Sparrer and it\nshowed, but only slightly. They played an\nenergetic set ably assisted by Blast Furnace,\nguesting on harp (that's harmonica to you\nlot!).\n\"Boogie on your back, boogie on your\nfeet....\" The blues-wailing sound of Lew\nLewis Reformer cut through my drunken\nhaze, the interplay between guitar and\nharmonica, over a steady bass and drums,\nmade for an excellent sound, both of old\nblues numbers and the band's own material.\nHaving seen the Inmates in a pub, about a month ago, I was very disappointed. They\nseemed to have lost something, including\nmany of their stronger numbers. The Rumour\nbrass section aided them on a number of\nsongs, but somehow it still didn't sound right\nAnyway, by the end of the gig, I was\nthoroughly knacker ed, and although\ndisappointed with the Inmates, Id been\nintroduced to some really good bands, so.\ncheck out Red Beans and Rice if you like\ngood soul music, and of course Lew Lewis\nReformer, I enjoyed most of it, and it seemed\nto me that everybody else did.\nSID BAYLIUS\nSome of the 30,000 Zulu warriors\nThe calm before the storm\nThe height ol the Battle Research and review by\not Isandlhwana Ma,T Freeman\nMarie-Theresa Weech\nJeremy Nunns\nSTREET LIGHT SHINE LP\nby the Shirts\nThe Shirts are a six-piece band from Noo\nYawk City. They have not received a great\ndeal of media recognition in this country, but\nyou may know their lead singer, Annie\nGolden, from her appearance in the film\nversion of 'Hair'.\nTheir first album, ingeniously entitled 'The\nShirts', was in my opinion, one of the best\ndebut albums of 1978. Not only did it contain\nsome great pop music, but it was packaged in\na cleverly designed record sleeve portraying\nan empty shirt playing a guitar!\nThe cover of their second LP, 'Street Light\nShine' is not nearly so exciting, in fact, you\ncould say it's rather dull. Indeed, the whole\nalbum seems to suffer from the same thing\nthat marred the Shirts' live performances in\nLondon earlier this year; an acute lack of\npersonality.\nBeginning life as a folk band in the early\nseventies, the Shirts didn't receive any real\nrecognition until 1977, as part of the 'new\nwave'. On Street Light Shine, the band refuse\nto allow either type of music to influence their\nmaterial, preferring it to remain blandly pop-orientated.\nBut evert so, they still don't appear to be at\nease with their own songs and tend to adopt a different disguise for each track, as on 'Love\nis a Fiction', where they do an excellent\nimpersonation of the Doolies, or the Rachel\nSweetish 'Can't Cry Anymore'.\nBut despite its obvious failings, the album\nis made worthwhile J \u00bby two great tracks,\nLaugh and Walk Away' and 'Starts with a Handshake', where the Shirts display what\nthey do best; fast, bouncy pop. It's a pity that\nthese songs will probably remain forever\nhidden on an otherwise unexceptional\nalbum.\nMaz\nPHOTOSOC\nIC Photographic Society will be holding a lecture\nentitled 'Now You See it - Now You Don't' on\nTuesday 6 November in RSM 303, to be given by Mr\nDP Hodgkinson, MPS.\nThe purpose of the lecture, as Mr Hodgkinson\nstates, is to demonstrate in a practical manner the\nadvantages of a polarizing filter to obtain improved\ncolour rendering in the finished product, be it print\nor transparency and particularly in relation to open\nair and landscape photography. Many\ntransparencies will be shown in sequential pairs,\nshowing the with and without effect.\nNeedless to say, this promises to bC* an\nexceptionally interesting lecture -1 trust you will be\nthere.\nGERMAN EXHANGE SCHOLARSHIP\nOne Scholarship Ii otter ed tor the 1980-81 session\nthrough the German Academic Exchange Service.\nThe Scholarship is tenable at any West German\nUniversity. There is no restriction on the field ol\nstudy. The minimum basic value of the award Is IM\n850 per month lor ten months, plus allowances lor\nbooks, travel expenses, health insurance, and\nIncidental expenses. No academic fees will be\npayable.

    "content": "Review \u2014 Collins English Dictionary\nThis book is symptomatic of the current ongoing situation in the american is ation of the\nEnglish language. The title itself contains two\nmisnomers: it is neither specifically English\nor a dictionary. It <s in fact a small\nencyclopedia since it contains in its 162,000\nentries, geographical details of now defunct\ncounties such as Denbighshire and short\nbiographies of authors such as John Le\nCarre. As to the supposed purpose of a dictionary that r' listing and defining words\nof a particular la.igu age, it fails to a certain\nextent, since it tries to encompass all the\nvarieties of English which now exist in the\nworld and in particular the American\nlanguage.\nIt is indeed curious that the list of special\nconsultants included at the beginning of *he\nbook does not list a specialist in 'American\nEnglish'. Does one presume that English\nscholars consider American and English to\nbe identical - from the dictionary entries it\nappears that this is so. Of particular note are\nthe phrases 'no way' and 'guidelines' which\nare good American and good German (kline\nweg and r echt sl in ien respectively) but bad\nEnglish. Similarly, that invidious word\n'situation' which has crept into everything\nfrom politics (international situation) to\ntennis (duce situation) is listed as if there was\nnothing wrong with these usages. Identical\nremarks can be applied to those words\nending in -ize or -iz ation. The editors have\nfailed to realise that English and American,\nwhile they have a similar vocabulary, have a different structure so that they should be\ntreated as separate languages and not\nlumped into one hot ch pot ch. Does then this dictionary have anything to\noffer the English reader? The answer is yes in\ntwo different ways. Firstly those words which\nit quaintly calls 'taboo slang' are defined with\ntheir proper and ancillary meanings. This is\nvaluable since it records the use of our own\neveryday spoken language; which has not\nbeen done until very recently. This is\ndemonstrated by the fact that very few\nspecific origins are given in the dictionary for\nthese words.\nThe second valuable function of this\ndictionary is its admirable non-eu them is tic definitions of political terms. Words and\nphrases such as liquidate, final solution,\neliminate, etc.. are given their proper\nmeaning in their political usage, ie the murder\nof inconvenient individuals for political\nreasons. The dictionary will have performed\nan immensely valuable function if those\ninterested in politics, not only outside the\ncollege, took the meaning of these words and\nsome others to heart.\nTo conclude: the dictionary is excellent\nvalue at eight pounds and ninety-five pence;\nit is clearly and accurately printed. But\nremember when using it that it is a dictionary\nof two languages and treat it accordingly.\nFrank\nJames\nICCU BOOKWEEK 1979\nTHE\nITALIAN\nCONNECTION\nI find some strange correspondence in my\npigeon hole sometimes but a letter I received\nlast week takes a bit of beating. It was from\nthe Director of a University College in Padua\n(after extensive enquiries around the Union\nOffice, I discovered this was somewhere in\nItaly) and I quote from it:\n\"....Now as they are very serious boys we\nwould like to put them in touch with your\nstudents of engineering and mate mat ical physics so that they can either exchange\ncorrespondence or exchange one another\nstaying visits...\"\nSomebody should correct me if I am wrong\nbut I take this as meaning that the students at\nthis Italian College want pen-friends. Here\nthen, is your chance to discuss Quantum\nPhysics in Italian, to have meaningful\ndiscussions on how engineers can save the\ncity of Venice or perhaps even have the\nopportunity of a cheap holiday in Italy next\nsummer. How can you miss this chance!\nIn order that I don't become inundated with\nenquiries about this Italian connection here's the address to write to:\nGiancarlo Granello,\nCollegio Universitario,\n. Gregorianum,\nPadova,\nItaly.\nThe buck has successfully been passed...\nGary Nichols\nICU AAO\nWhy bother with Jesus? This is the theme\nof this year's Bookweek, which begins on. Monday 5 November. What is Bookweek, you\nmay ask? A few words of explanation are in\norder. It is run by Christians in College who\nfeel that, all too often, people today are being\nconfronted by cults who claim that Jesus is\nbut one way to God, that He was just one of\nmany prophets. But we as Christians believe\nthat He is the only way, for He Himself said, \"I am the way and the truth and the life. No-one\ncomes to the Father except through me.\"\n(John 14.6)\nThrough Bookweek, we hope to be able to\ntalk openly to people, especially our non-Christian friends, about our faith, and also to\nenable people to consider further His\nwonderful offer of salvation, through reading.\nThe main book for this week is \"Why Bother\nWith Jesus?\", by Michael Green, Rector of St\nAldates' Church in Oxford. This is a lively\ndiscussion on why we should take Jesus\nseriously, and is well worth getting. Two\nother books we would like you to read are\n'The Case Against Christ' and 'Evidence for\nthe Resurrection'. Copies of these will be on\nsale on book stalls throughout the College.\nThere will also be available other Christian\nbooks, Bibles and tracts. The latter will be\nfree of charge. *\nFinally, I would like to tell you about some\nother events being held during Bookweek. At\n6:30pm on Tuesday 6 November, there will be\na thirty minute film entitled, 'A Day With Cliff\nRichard', in room 342 Mech Eng. Many of you\nwill of course know that Cliff is a Christian\nand an active witness for the Lord. On\nThursday 8 November, Sandy Millar, from\nHoly Trinity, Brompton, will be giving a talk\non 'Why Bother With Jesus?'. This will be at\n1:30pm in the Senior Common Room, Union\nBuilding. Incidentally Holy Trinity, Brompton\nis a lively Anglican church just a Few minutes'\nwalk from Southside, and is well worth a visit.\nDon't forget Bookweek is between 5-9\nNovember.\nWhy Bother With Jesus?\nIs Jesus of Nazaretn a historical figure or\njust a myth? Is he the Son of God, or was he\njust a good man?\nBeginning with the question\" Why bother?\", Michael Green, the Rector of a large, lively church in Oxford, outlines man's need of Jesus in relation to aspects of Jesus'\nlife and teaching. The chapters are concise\nand thought-provoking. Two particularly\ninteresting ones are 'Bother Because He is\nReal', where some historical evidence for\nJesus' existence is set out and 'Bother\nBecause He Conquered Death', where Jesus'\nalleged resurrection is discussed: the empty\ntomb, the resurrection appearances to his\nfollowers, their changed lives, and the rise of\nthe Christian Church. The verdict: Jesus did\nrise from the dead.\nWriting in a conversational style, Green\nquotes well-known people as examples of\nhow Jesus can change a man's life, giving\nfulfilment of a kind not previously\nexperienced.\nThis book is especially relevant to you if\nyou are beginning to seriously consider\nJesus' amazing claims about himself, for\nexample that he was the long awaited\n'Messiah'\nAvailable from Christian Union book stalls around college in the week 5-9 November,\n'Why Bother With Jesus' is published by\nHodder and will cost 60p. e^fl VJ Cl Guy\n16\n\n"

    "content": "WHY WE SHOULD OPPOSE\nCUTS IN EDUCATION\nIn recent weeks there has been much talk in\nIC and FELIX over government policy on\neducation. Criticism of the action of ICU has\nconsisted of poor reporting and bigoted\nletters in FELIX. However, to be fair, opposers\nof these cuts have failed to fully publicize the\nfac li, and more importantly, show the\nimmoral basis of current policy. I hope to\ncorrect this. Firstly however, I would like to\ndraw attention to two examples of FELIX'S biased attitude to the fight against the cuts.\n1.19 October FELIX front page: The 'narrow\nmajority' of fifteen was on the vote on Chris\nWebb's amendment to the occupation\nmotion. The actual vote on the occupation\nmotion gave a majority of over fifty, hardly\nnarrow. If people wanted to vote against the\nmotion, they should have had enough faith in\ntheir beliefs to act.\n2. 26 October FELIX front page: The nasty\ncartoon associated with an article on the\nRector's speech at commemoration day -obviously directed against those opposing\nthe cuts. Students fighting the cuts will be cut\nthemselves?\nA fuller presentation of the facts is available\non the back page of 26 October FELIX, and in\nthe last Exec News.\nSome things are blatantly obvious from\nthese policies. Firstly, a racialist policy has\nbeen operated in education, and this will be\nescalated. This is an insult to other countries,\nparticularly the underdeveloped, and assumes that overseas students area burden.\nOn the contrary, they enrich our lives and\nprovide useful social, political and economic\nties, forging trading links with our country. It\nis obvious the education of overseas students\nis an immense help to underdeveloped\ncountries and current policy evidently says,\n\"We don't want you!\"\nreduction in nursery expenditure is in\ncontradiction, to the Tory manifesto. This\ngovernment also promised to maintain\nessential services, but how the proposed\nreductions will not eventually close courses,\neducation establishments and ultimately\nreduce standards and opportunities is\nbeyond me. Presumably education is a nonessential service? Try telling that to the\nmillions of children and parents involved in\nschools and colleges!\nSo the government reneges on promises,\nand acts through selfish and bigoted instinct,\ninstead of commonsense. In a democracy,\nthe only thing we can do to change such\npolicy is protest, demonstrate and publicize\nI1111 \u2022\n1 j. \u2022 m Photo by Chris Webb\nThe Commemoration Day protest inside the\nAlbert Hall\nIt is to be noted that these two worst\nexamples are both on the front page. Perhaps\nFELIX can publish opinions outside the\nreporting columns in future?\nSome Facts\n1. \u00a355million reduction in central government\nexpenditure on education.\n2. \u00a3l50 million reduction in local government\nexpenditure on education.\n3. 60% increase in overseas students fees,\n1977-78, 30% increase in overseas students\nfees, 1979-80.\n4. The near certainty that the government will\ncharge overseas students the mythical full\ncost for the year 1980-81, \u00a32,550.\n5. The cut in nursery education of 32%.\n6. \u00a360million available to send bright pupils to\nindependent schools from 1981.\nSecondly, expenditure on education\navailable to everyone is being decreased,\nwhile increasing expenditure on the more\nacademically capable. Such a policy destroys\na basic principle of comprehensive education, that a person should be able to\nachieve their full potential in whichever field\nthey are capable r. Such a policy decreases\nopportunities for many, while increasing\nthem for the few. It will be socially devi sive, and result in envy and hatred, at a time when it\nis blatantly obvious that many of our\nproblems are due to the inability to\ncommunicate with each other\nThirdly, education is being cut when it\nshould be expanded We face problems of\nhigh unemployment and increased leisure\ntime caused by the microprocessor revolution and one of the most obvious ways\nfor people to use time creatively is by learning\nskills and pursuing interests, otherwise not\nopen to them.\nIt has been said frequently that any action\nto protest against these policies is\nautomatically a confrontation with a government, elected by a large majority. So it\nis, but no mention was made of such cuts\nduring the general election, indeed the\nPhoto by Paul Johnson\nThe 'Funeral March' makes its way to the\nAlbert Hall\nthe facts. We are in the process of creating an\neducation system based on privilege, racism\nand envy. It is a fundamental right of an\nindividual to an education reflecting his\naspirations and abilities. It is the job of\neveryone concerned about education to stop\nthe policies and reverse them. I urge every\nperson this college to get out and act now,\nbefore it's too late!\nForthcoming Actions\nMonday 5 November: Demonstration.

    "content": "SPORT\nIn the absence of the Times, and with the\ncontinuing ITV strike, reports and screenings\nof some of the premier football matches have\nbeen badly missed. I therefore feel it my duty\nto inform all FELIX readers of Saturday's epic\nUL U cup-tie between IC 2nd XI and UC2 nd XI.\nAfter a ragged first ten minutes, IC settled\ndown and began to play the ball about. Soon\nthe IC pressure began to tell, and we forced\nfive consecutive corners. Dave Dean then had\nan excellent shot-on-the-turn well saved. A free-kick made the UC goalkeeper perform a mid-air juggling act with the ball, but still we\ncould not score. UC later made several\nsustained attacks, but with veteran Chris\nBeer reinforcing the defence, we held firm.\nHalf-time came with the deadlock unbroken.\nBoth teams now began to play with more\naggression and determination. Al Lenczner\nmade several brave runs, but still no goals\ncame. A couple of UC breakaway s produced\ngood chances, but IC persevered with their\nattack. A late corner fell for Dave Dean,\nwhose shot was cleared off the line, and\nseconds later, goalkeeper Al Betts, pulled out\nan 'elastic-armed' save to deny UC. The game\nended as a00 draw, to be replayed\ntomorrow.\nI trust this report will satisfy those who were.\nunable to obtain tickets for the game.\nGiles Breton\nIC 4th \u00bb vs Holloway 3rds This last week has seen IC 4th s first\ncompetitive matches of the season. Both\ncoincident ly against the same team. On Wednesday, away to RH C3 rds, in appalling\nconditions, their pitch being the size of a gnat's arse, with contours reminiscent of a gravel pit, we could only manage a43 win.\nICRFC 1sts19 Royal Holloway 1st s3IC RFC Ists travelled to Egham on Saturday\nand accomplished a satisfying victory over\nlast season's Gutteridge Cup winners, Royal\nHolloway.\nThe match started at a furious pace and\nRoyal Holloway quickly scored with a penalty\nfrom inside IC's22 metre line. From this point\nin time, the IC pack began to play much better\nand Royal Holloway were increasingly placed\non the defence. Finally this pressure paid off\nand after swift passing from the IC\nthree quarters Ray( OldMan again!)\nParkinson went over for a try beneath the goal\nposts. Steve Doloney increased the lead with\nthe conversion.\nRUGBY\nIC 3rds vs Wimbledon 4th s14:3 IC just managed to round up a side to play\n'the dons', but it meant the inclusion of the IC\nfirst team skipper at full back. Despite this\nsetback, IC were con v ident of a win, because\nall the pack were playing positions which\nthey were used to playing in - unlike the week\nbefore when there was a winger playing\nhooker, a number eight playing prop and a flanker playing second row and of course the\ninevitable footballer playing centre.\nNeil Price\nLast Saturday IC Vth XI beat LSE IVth XI, 3-2, in the preliminary round of the UL U Cup. In\na scrappy, wr,|-cc n tested match, which saw\nthem 2-0 down at half-time, IC showed that\nthey have the playing ability to match their\ndetermination.\nLSE might argue that a draw would have\nbeen a fair result; but the outcome was just.\nNo team that squanders a20 lead deserves to\nwin a cup tie.\nSkip\nUniversity College Hospital 1 IC Ists 4\nIC travelled to Shenley without their\nrecognised centre-forward and with a dismal\nrecord which gave little hope of victory.\nHowever, IC settled down first and began to\ndominate the early stages. Dick Veenam and\nAndy Haralampous went close as IC\npressured the home defence. But IC found it\ndifficult to score until Graham Rickard\ncunningly played a low corner to lan\nStevenson standing unmarked on the edge of\nthe box, whose shot blasted through the\ncrowded penalty area and into the net.\nAdrian Clarke and Kev Buckley running\ntirelessly in midfield had taken over and\nBuckley provided the final pass for goal\nnumber four. He put Andy Haralampous clear\nwith only the goalkeeper to beat. His shot hit\nthe goalkeeper's legs, but he volleyed the\nlooping rebound off the goalpost to complete\nthe scoring and settle the issue beyond\ndoubt.\nTeam: Betts-Gamble, Reeve, Kenrik,\nCurran Clarke, Buckley, Hara lamp o us, Stevenson-Veenam, Rickard.\nThe Geordie Goalscorer\nSTRANGE BEHAVIOUR ON ELEC ENG\nROOF\nHere it is at last!

The British Empire is reaching its height under the\nreign of Queen Victoria and the policies of the Prime Minister, Benjamin\nDisraeli, are daily increasing Britain's wealth and lands. However, in\nCentral South Africa, Lord Chelmsford, commander in chief of Her\nMajesty's forces (played by Peter O Toole) together with the newly\nappointed High Commissioner, Sir Henry Bartle Frere (played by John\nMills) see the greatest threat to Britain's rule as the Zulus whose\nkingdom borders Natal. The Zulu warriors, feared by British and Boers\nalike, are highly trained and organised. They obey their ruler, King\nCetshwayo (played by Simon Sabella) without question and his rule is\nautocratic and absolute. He would defend his right to rule under Zulu\nlaw with eloquence, for he is a highly intelligent man but, also if\nnecessary with force. Chelmsfored and Bartle Frere send messages to\nLondon continually each asking more urgently for more troops to\ndefend Natal. In London, the Colonial Office refuses their requests all\nthrough the summer of 1878, but eventually, on recognising that the\nthree week communication delay between Natal and London could be\ndisastrous, troops are sent out in the December of 1878 as a precautionary measure. The troops arrive and Chelmsford and Frere\nimmediately contrive an ultimatum to give to the Zulu king, which they\nknow the Zulus cannot accept. It commits Britain to war, directly in\nconflict with London's instructions; which were to make peace with the\nblack tribes, to gain support against the Boers. Thus began a war which\nChelmsford and Frere confidently think will be brief and conclusive in\nbringing the Zulus to heel. A war that is to become exceedingly bloody\nand one of the few defeats Britain had in its colonial wars. It was\ntragically misdirected and extracting a terrible price in both wealth and\nlives. Zulu Dawn is an epic film, produced in the centenary year of the\nwar, that charts the devastation caused by Lord Chelmsford's ultimatum.\n| JEZ\nWILL\nI PUT\nTOGETHER\nf THIS\n\\ WEEKEND\nlan Morse\nMaz\nMary Freeman\nRoger Stotesbury\nPat Leggett\nMarie-Therese\nDave Fuller\nJohn Clark CREDITS\nChris Webb\nPaul Johnson\nMany Perkins\nSimon Chandler\nJeremy Nunns\n& Ace paste-up artist Margaret\nFELIX is published by the Acting Editor, on behalf of\nthe Imperial College Publications Board.

There was a good\nnumber of fresher s staying for the yards and\ngames after the Met and Mat Sci Dinner and\nthe Min Res Eng was, as is usually the case,\ninimitable. For those not in Mines, it would be\na good idea to ask the stupefied guilds men and scientists who were present at the after-dinner bash, as to just how good it was.\nThere is going to be a Rag Collection on\nSaturday 3 November (ie tomorrow), so fall\nout of bed and crawl to the Union Office at\n9:30 in the morning. Be there!\nOn Friday 9 November, there is going to be\nan Aussie Barnight in the Union Bar (where\nelse?) - wear your shorts, Aussie tee shirts\nand hats with corks.\nThe following day sees the Lord Mayor's Procession, in which Mines has a float. Lots\nof people are needed to help put the float\ntogether - if you are interested see Andy\nLewis or Bernie Pryor via the Union Office.\nThose putting a lot of effort into it will stand a better chance of having a place on the float\nitself. The Lord Mayor himself has interests in\nthe mining world and last Tuesday three\nminers, Bernie Pryor, Andy Lewis and Pete\nGilligan (of the Texan beard) were invited a press reception at the Clothworkers Hall in\nthe City. Along with the other selected guests\n(such as Goldfields, Walt Disney, China,\nCostains etc) they met the ladies and\ngentlemen of Fleet Street and had there fill of\nfree drinks (lucky so dsl). This may account\nfor the sightings on Tuesday of three\nindividuals in mining gear wandering around\nMines looking (and acting) rather the worse\nfor wear.\nOn Sunday 11 November there will be a Raft Race.

    "content": "ZIMBABWE\nOn 11 November I965, UDI was declared by\nIan Smith. Ever since that time his regime has\nbrought more torture and suffering to the\nblack people of Zimbabwe. The so-called\n'internal settlement' of 3 March I978 has not\nlessened the problem, in fact it has escalated.\nOver 95% of the country is now under martial\nlaw.\nBishop Muzorewa's puppet government\nhave caused the murder of thousands of\npeople in Zimbabwe and in the neighbouring\ncountries. The Mozambican government is at\nthis moment having extreme difficulty with\nthe massive influx of refugees fleeing\nZimbabwe, and also having to defend itself\nfrom the invading forces.\nAt the time when the British press had a large coverage about the Patriotic Front\nleaders refusing to go to a cocktail party with\nthe committee at Lancaster House, Muzorewa's forces were bombing a refugee\ncamp in Moazmbique (which only managed\nto get four lines in the Guardian).\nThis is the first in an occasional series of\narticles on the subject of hitch-hiking which I hope might prove to be of use and interest to\nsome people. It is mainly a personal view, but\nI have drawn some of my information from\nbooks written on the subject (eg 'Let's Go Europe').\nIn this article I'd like to answer a few\narguments used by people who think that\nhitch-hiking is in some way wrong or too\nunreliable as a means of getting from A to B. 'It's a Form of Begging'\nI really object to the view that if you can't afford to travel by conventional means, you\nshouldn't travel at all. The hitch-hiker cannot\nin any way force drivers to give him a lift;\nthey'll only give you a ii ft if they have room in\nthe vehicle and they want some company.\nThankfully there are also those who feel a social responsibility to give lifts. It doesn't put\nthem out much and some drivers, especially\ntruckers and salesmen, are glad of the\ncompany. Two examples spring to mind, a driver who had left the motorway at every\ninterchange in search of hit cher, before he\nfound me, because he was bored out of his\nmind and another van driver who stopped for\nme because,\u00abas he said: \"I knew it was time to\nfind somebody to talk to because I was\nstarting to tell myself jokes.\" I reckon hitchhikers perform a public service by helping\ntruck drivers to stay awake on long motorway\nruns.\n'It's Slow and Unreliable'\nOf course it can be; there is no way that you\ncan guarantee that you'll get where you want\nto within a certain time limit, but then public\ntransport is fallible too. There's an element of\nluck in the lifts you get, although this can be\nreduced to reasonable probabilities if you are\nCarrington's proposals offer no solution to\n\u2022the problem:\n1. An election in two months time is\nridiculous! How can you have a democratic\nelection when there is not enough time for the\nvoters to be registered? This is how\nMuzorewa was 'elected'.\n2. Another proposal is for a British governor\nto oversee the transitional period. The PF\nwant a six person committee which consists\nof three PF members, two VAN C( Muzorewa's party) members and\u00bbone white. A much more\ndemocratic basis surely!\n3. Carrington also wants British troops to take\nover the security forces. The PF want United\nNations troops to do this job. Which of the\ntwo is likely to be the more unbiased?\n4. The lifting of sanctions. At first sight this\nappears rather trivial since we've all heard of\nthe Oilgate scandal etc. But sanctions have\ncaused some problems. The army is not as\nmobile as it likes and the lifting of sanctions\nby Britain (the decision date is 14 November)\nin the right place at the right time (more\ndetails about the right places and times in the\nnext article). Maybe I'm lucky but several\ntimes I 've left the Union Bar when it shut on a Friday lunchtime and hitched to Swansea in\ntime for the pubs evening opening time.\n'It's not Safe'\nFor single women it probably isb't, there\nare still quite a few 'fast drivers' (in both\nsenses of the phrase) around. For men it's a lot easier (although I was propositioned once\nI got out of that car VERY quick).\nHitching in pairs is safer for women, but\nslower because some drivers either cannot\n(because of lack of space) or will not pick up\nmore than one person at a time. There's always the problem of maniacal drivers who\nput your safety at stake by their abominable\ndriving; if you feel really frightened just\npretend you're about to be sick al I over the car\nthey soon slow down or let you out.\n'Only Tramps and Long-haired Degenerates\nHitch-hike'\nFar from it. The main classes of people 'on\nthe road' are:\n1. Servicemen\nThey stay in uniform and generally get lifts\nvery quickly.\n2. 'Trade Drivers'\nThey carry red 'trade plates' used for\ntemporary registration of vehicles, which\ngives them preference amongst fellow\ndrivers.\n3. Students\nThe college scarf can act like the old school\ntie, because there are quite a lot of people\nwho have cars now but used to hitch in their\nstudent days (an ex-IC student once took me\ntwenty miles out of his way).\n4. Tramps and long-haired degenerates.\nHitch-hiking can be great fun; you meet all\nsorts of people and you get to places you may\nnot have been able to afford to visit otherwise.\nEnough of this romantic ising about life on the\nroad....next week more useful information:\ngeneral principles of hitch-hiking, choosing\nyour routes and how to get lifts.\nGilly Anchors\nwould cause the rest of the world to lift their\nsanctions, with the inevitability of arms being\nsent to support a government which uses\nmartial law to suppress the majority of the\npeople. Apartheid has not ceased because\nMuzorewa came to power. He is just a puppet.\nThe atrocities have increased and are still\ngoing on at this moment.\nThere will be a march on 11\nNovember from Speakers\nCorner at 1:30pm. Your\nsupport is needed.\nJan\nCzernuszka\nPWP\n(and they AflE permanently working)\nMonday's drawn-out meeting of ICU Permanent Working Party was attended by a number of observers, mainly Dep Reps (for\ndiscussion on wastage of heat and paper in\nthe Union, and in the College in general) and\nUnion Officers, putting their cases for a Union place in Hall for next year's incumbent.\nThe first topic proved less contentious and\nit seems likely that recommendations for\ndouble-sided printing and closer controls of\n'extra copies' will be circulated, together with\n(another) concerted campaign to cut heating\nand lighting costs this winter.\nThe Union Hall places controversy raged\nas bitterly as ever - the main difficulty\nappearing to be how one defined 'essential'\nand 'helpful'. One valid point is that stripping\nSabbatical Officers of their free House/Hall\nplace would involve substantial remuneration\nand/or payment of rent.\nFurther (and it is to be hoped final)\ndiscussion is planned for next week.

Council completely\nover rid union policy in rejecting\nthe claim to take the banner.\nThe rel event piece of policy was\npassed last term (Council did not\neven bother to find out what it\nwas), the particular clauses which\ncover action against the Corrie\nBill are:\n\"ICU believes....2) Abortion\nshould be free on demand up until\nthe date when the foetus would be\nable to survive independently of\nthe mother,\" and\n\"ICU instructs....2) That we\nsupport ALRA (Abortion Law\nReform Association).\nFrom both these statements we\nmust conclude that IC Union is\nagainst the Corrie Bill, which\nseverly restricts the availability of\nabortion; and since ALRA was on\nthe march and actively campaigns\nagainst Corrie, so should ICU.\nThe IC contingent, on Sunday,\nthus decided that Council was in\ngross contravention of its role in\ntaking this action.\nThat Council made its decision\nwithout due consideration can be\nseen from the various quotes\nbelow (which, to the best of my\nknowledge, are accurate).\nMark Clegg: \"I don't know as\nmuch about it as you do, and I'm not that bothered about it\nanyway.\"\nRichard Earl: \"Abortion is a moral issue.\"\nRoger Stotesbury voted against\ntaking the banner because it was a TUC demo and Chris Fox asked,\n\"Why would anyone care to take\nthe banner on a march anyway?\"\nWe could therefore ask that our\nexecutive .pay more attention to\ncurrent IC Union policy than to\ncertain eloquent speakers at\ncollege committees.\nMerche Clark\nMaths 3\nDear Sir\nI feel I must reply to Mr\nWaterworth's insulting letter in\nlast week's FELIX.\nI am not a beer-swilling lout with\na large alimentary canal. I only\ndrink about five pints a week.\nWhat is wrong With me urging\nthe Union to concern itself only\nwith matters of \"direct concern to\nthe majority of students\". It is,\nafter all, the Imperial College\nStudents Union and not a philanthropic organisation. Didn't we vote to get out of NUS because\nwe were worried about the time\nwasted on external affairs?\nMr Waterworth, you may find my\nviews \"depressing\" but I find the\nreluctance of College to provide\ngood ac common dati on and the\npoo i catering one of the\ndepressing things about IC. When\nI occasionally have a drink at\nCollege, I find the exorbitant\nprices depressing. We have the\nmost expensive university bars I know of including Cambridge,\nNewcastle, Durham, Shefield,\nand Nottingham.\nYou talk about issues. I am in\nfavour of foreign aid and as I stated in my previous letter I only\nwish rich countries, ie countries\nnot receiving foreign aid, to pay\nthe full economic cost of\neducating their citizens.\nOne hundred million pounds\ncan't be dismissed; remember the\ntroubled caused over the ordered\n\u00a32million cuts to two local health\nauthorities. Mr Waterworth, how\nmany Arabs or Malaysians do yo\nsee dying of malnutrition?\nPerhaps when you have spent a few more years at College you will\nbe more qualified to speak on the\nsubject.\nYours faithfully\nJonathan Pearson\nElec Eng 3\nDear Sir\nMay I convey my congratulations\nto you and your staff for having\nthe guts to print the story on page\nfifteen of last week's FELIX.\nI don't honestly know what ICU\nhoped to achieve by the\noccupation further than just a statement of intent, and I refuse to\nbelieve that they would be as\nnaive as to expect ANY type of\ncommunication from Margaret\nThatcher or Mark Carlisle, let\nalone surrenders.\nIf they wanted to air their/our\ngrievances in such a way as to\nattract maximum publicity and\nminimum inconvenience they\nmight have organised a petition\nspreading, say, throughout the\nUniversity of London. A10,000 name petition I feel would have\nhad a greater impact.\nCongratulations again - I don't think you've heard the last of the\ncomment.\nYours faithfully\nJohn Clark\nCCD3 PS - Before anyone calls me a fascist, I'd like to point out that I do agree that indiscriminate cuts\ncould damage the tertiary\neducation sector.\nDear Mr Palmer\nI am writing to you to clarify the\nsituation regarding the publication of my photographs in FELIX.\nIn 12 October's FELIX, you\npublished a photograph taken by\nmyself of the giant Tiddle and\nWink taken in Regent Street. You\nstated you would give me a credit\nfor this picture in the issue but this\ndid not happen.\nFurther to our conversation\nyesterday it appears that you\ncame into possession of a copy of\n. the current Broadsheet cover\nphotograph under c iru cm stances that can only be described as\nquestionable. It also seems that\nyou were considering using this\nphotograph in the current issue of\nFELIX. If I had not spoken to you\nand this photograph had been\nused I have no doubt that there\nwould have been no credit for it in\nFELIX.\nI would like to point out that I own full copyright of both these\nphotographs and as such they\ncannot be reproduced without my\npermission. In the first instance\nmy permission was given subject\nto the giving of a credit which did\nnot occur. In the second instance I again gave my permission for the\nphotograph to be used but I have\nno doubt that if we had not met\nyesterday the photograph might\nhave been used without my\npermission.\nIn the future, if you use any\nphotograph of which I am the\ncopyright holder ie any\nphotograph that I take, since I will\nnot take photographs for anyone\non any basis that does not leave\nme as the copyright owner;\nwithout my prior written\npermission I shall have no\nhesitation in taking action against\nyourself as editor of FELIX and\nagainst FELIX for damages for\nbreach of copyright.\nYours sincerely\nSteve Hutchings\nChem 1\nDear C6lin\nEvery ardent reader of FELIX\nwill note that a deadline for i the next copy is given. If one gets a piece of literature into the FELIX\nOffice by this time it is very likely\nto be in the next week's FELIX.\nLast year I wrote a reasonable\nnumber of sports reports and\neach being delivered by the\ndeadline appeared in the\nfollowing FELIX.\nThis year as well as a new editor,\nother changes seem to have\noccurred. My particular grievance\nis a water polo summer tour\nreport. Having put some effort\ninto writing it, I ensured that it was\npresented not only to the FELIX\nOffice, but to you personally by\nthe deadline on 8 October. You\ncan possibly understand my\nsurprise when it didn't appear in\nthe following FELIX. I naturally\nwent to the FELIX Office and\nenquired why my report,\nadmittedly not a work of literary\ngenius, but by no means\nunprintable, had not appeared. I was told more important news had\ngone in instead and was assured it\nwould go into the next FELIX. Well\ndo you think it did? NO! I again\nwent to the FELIX Office and Maz\ninformed me that you decide what\ngoes in and what doesn't and it is\nthe job of the editor. I don't argue\nwith that. I am then assured that\nefforts will be made to get it in the\nfollowing week. In my innocence,\nI assumed it would appear.\nThis morning arrives and not\nonly is my sports report not in, but\nthere is not one sport report any\nwhere. Did sport stop for a week,\nperhaps in protest at the\neducation cuts!\nAs the editor I consider it your\njob to balance our student paper,\nto put in articles that are\ninformative as well as fun to read.\nSports reports may not interest\neveryone, but are two fu 1\n1 pages of\ncartoons really necessary.\nPE Mills\nChem Eng 3\nCOPY DEADLINE\n4\n\n"

    "content": "THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION Friday, November 2nd,1979 Issue No. 532\nPROBLEMS FOR FELIX\nA FELIX reporter has been fined \u00a3 2 9 5 by customs. The reporter\nhad been on an assignment in another country, and on his\nreturn he didn't declare a camera he had purchased there. This\nwas a result, claimed the reporter, of his not having slept for\nseveral days prior to his return. The camera was discovered in a spot check, and was subsequently impounded, although several\nreels of film were not.\nMichael Arthur, the Union Welfare Advisor, is currently\nassisting him in his efforts to get the camera back.\nOn a brighter note, two IC photographers have achieved\ndistinction, this week. The RCS photographer had one of his\nphotographs printed on the front page of the South Kensington\nnews and Chelsea Post. Colin Palmer, the Acting Editor of FELIX\nis credited with a photo on page 86 of the current Radio Times.\nColin took the picture when he was working freelance with the\nBBC. Motion on Bye-Laws\nA motion concerning Imperial\nCollege bye-laws, proposed by\nRichard Earl and seconded by P Spencer-Phillips, will be heard at\nthe next U GM, on Tuesday 6\nNovember.\nThe motion concerns the\napparent transgression of ICU bye-laws by the Executive in\nconnection with the dismissal of\nJohn Shuttleworth as Editor of\nFELIX.\nTHE CORRIE MARCH\nOn Sunday there was a march\nagainst the Corrie Bill in central\nLondon. About 3 0 people from\nImperial College took part in the\nmarch, 1 0 of these were men.\nSome 2 2 Universities took part\nfrom such diverse places as Bath\nand Lancaster. Despite being\ncontrary to the vote taken at last\nweek's ICU Council, the Imperial\nCollege Union banner was taken\non the march and the Exec will\ndiscuss this topic at their next\nmeeting. By the time that the\ndemon start or s from IC had\nreached Trafalgar Square, the\nmain speeches had finished and\nthey were asked by police to go\nhome.\nRCS RAG\nApproximately \u00a3 5 5 0 was collected by the Royal College of\nScience Union on Saturday by\nselling shares in the Underwater\nCompany outside Harrods. About\n4 0 people took part, including\nsome in wet suits, and a piano was\nalso taken.\nA license has been granted\nallowing street collections to take\nplace at the same time as this\nyears rag procession, which is on\nthe17 th November. The collection taken on that day will\nbe in aid of the National Deaf\nChildren's society only and will\nenable one or more hearing aids\nto be produced as soon as\npossible after the procession has\ntaken place.\nAMBULANCE\nPRESENTATION see pages 10 and 11\nCCD OVERSPENDS BUDGET\nThe Department of Computing\nand Control has already overspent its complete yearly\nbudget. The head of the department, Professor Lehman,\nspeaking at the department's annual Fresher's dinner, on\nMonday night, explained that\naccording to the UGC norms,\nComputer Science is regarded as\na Mathematically based subject\nand funded accordingly. The CCD course is in fact heavily\nlaboratory based and its fiscal\nneeds correspond to that of an\nengineering department. Profeesor Lehman went on to say\nthat if the College was to continue\nto offer what is now widly\nrecognised as one of the best\nComputer Science courses in the\ncountry, the funding level for the\ndepartment would have to be\nsignificantly increased, despite\nthe current cutbacks in education.\nTo obtain such an increase\nwould involve a hard fight, since it\nentailed taking funds from other\ndepartments. Professor Lehman\nlooked for the support of the\nGuilds' Union, in achieving an\nadequate level of funding.\nOPEN MEETING\nAt 1pm on Wednesday about 40\npeople attended the occupation\nmeeting held in the Union Dining\nRoom. Chris Fox the Union\nPresident, reported that the\noccupation of the SDR had\nfinished and that the mock funeral\noutside the Albert Hall with the\ndistribution of leaflets had been\nsuccessful. Following in the\nfootsteps of IC, UMIST have gone\ninto occupation over the issue of\neducation spending s ut s and were\nvery rapidly supported by\nManchester University who\nstarted their own occupation.\n\n"

No not the Chinese\nvariety but a so-called 'pop group' from\nLeeds.\nNews travels fast and the Gang's recent ULU\nRock Against Racism event was a sell-out.\nBehind them, a giant poster 'Southall Kids are\nInnocent', in front an expectant gathering.\nThey start to play at express train speed and\naccelerate from' there. How can you describe\ncombined perfection and ecstasy? The\nbuilding fell to the ground; an atom bomb\nlanded in Central London; Coronation Street\nreturned to the screens; World War was\ndeclared and the solar system fell into a black\nhole. We didn't even notice and wouldn't have\ncared anyway. To say that the Gang are\nintense, thought provoking, forceful and\nbrilliant is a gross understatement and almost\nan insult. To compare them with anything\nelse would likewise degrade them.\nNo song stood out from the rest for special\nmention, everything was there, the singles,\nthe album, all in one sustained barrage of\nrhythm, power, excitement and potential.\nThroughout the basic beat was overlay ed with machine gun guitar and vocals full of\ntrue emotion. People in the know have even\nnamed them the new Nolan Sisters or even\nthe teenage Lena Martell. What more can I say?\nHear their debut album 'Entertainment!' and\nbe educated.

Harvey's show, 'Wake up With\nHarvey' starts at 8am and lasts for three hours, so the records\nand features need to be prepared before Saturday night. A regular feature is Harvey's 'Nurd at Nine' - the worst record to\narrive at IC Radio in the previous week, and that's played at just\nafter 9am in each week's programme.

This\nwas Ian (Ware does exist) Reed, who was\nactually responsible for one of the games\nwon. Kartik (the chubby one) Lakhani won\ntwo game and so did C Hong (the quiet one).\nThe seconds were rather less fortunate, yet\nagain failing to trouble the divisional points\ntable, when losing 7-2 at home to Sarah\nSiddons (she must be good....know what I mean, eh?).\nIC continued their ir resist able drive for the\ntop, rolling over Imperial Group( Tobacco)\nfirst team, 9-0 (I bet they were fuming!)\nIC4 vs Imperial Group2( home) 8-1\nMinus their captain (at home in Worksopgreat cheering, sounds of Theakston's Old P. splashing inside dimple mugs) the fourths\nplayed brilliantly to register a convincing\nvictory. Their team was Wilson, Ho and\nFalcone.\nTHE PARK GATE PERVERT TABLE\nTENNIS\nIC1 vs INCO 5-4\nhome\nWith the opponents having been recently\nrelegated from the division above, the firsts\nexpected (and got) a tough match. This\nmatch (most of which I saw) was played in a very good spirit and saw all the first team lose\nto one player for the first time this season.\nHowever, Kartik, Pete and Hongy played well\nenough to win the five matches that were\nnecessary.\nIC2 vs GAINS FORD545 away\nThe first point for IC 2nds, but yet another\n(albeit slim) defeat. The side consisted of\nAndy Tye (two wins) and the inexperienced\n(but promising) first year pair of Walker and\nEtheridge (one each).\nIC3 vs FULHAM381 home\nAnother crushing victory (since I was\ndropped the thirds haven't lost!) by Blambert,\nBreed and Bhong-Tai Man.

There was a poor turn\nout of only twelve people so the tournament\nstarted in the quarterfinals. After a good\ntwenty-four break by the immortal Sanjit\n'Flukey' Teelock, he and Martin 'Casanova'\nProudlove forged their way to the final where\nthey met me and Shaun Armstrong, who was\nrunner up in the fresher s knockout competition. Having watched Geoff Kegmer\ntry to get five snooker s on the pink in the\nprevious match, we entered the final half\nasleep, where Teelock and Proudlove talked\nthemselves to victory, beating us two frames\nto nil.\nAnd now for something completely the\nsame....Anyone wishing to have lessons,\neither beginners or more advanced ers, should come to the snooker room and sign\non. Lessons are on Monday at 5:30.\nFinally, for the sale of the century; we have\ngreen baize (ex-snooker cloth) for sale at a ridiculous knock-down price of fifty pence\nper square foot.

The league, being a handicap\nleague, is comprised os the full range of\nbowling talent from beginner upwards.\nForthcoming events include inter university matches against Southampton and\nBrunei within the next few weeks. The club\nwill supply many of the members of the\nLondon University team to compete in these\nmatches.\nA list of inter-university fixtures and the\ndates of tournaments hosted by other\nuniversities throughout Britain, is being sent\nto club members soon. We hope to send\nstrong conti gents to most of these\ntournaments.\nThe Wednesday league is settling down to\nsteady bowling; scores of note to date include\na604 series by Danny Lau and several\n200plus games. New bowlers and new teams\nare still welcome, so if you're keen to have a go, join us at 2:30pm on Wednesday\nafternoon outside the entrance to Aero Eng\n(opposite Beit Archway) where we board the\ncoach to Tolworth.\nBrian MacGowan\nLAST WEEKS ARTICLE\nORIENTEERING\nDespite the non-appearance of the\npromised minibus, ten members of ICO C travelled fifty miles to compete in an event in\nAngley Woods, Kent.\nAfter the wide open spaces.of Hampstead\nHeath, this was a sharp contrast. Even those\nareas on the map marked as run n able were\ncomposed of young trees, six foot high\nbrake n and brambles. Consequently times\nfor all courses were relatively slow, a fact not\nhelped by the high number of controls per\nkilometre.\nMembers of ICO C met with varied success\nwith Alan Parker running well on the longest\ncourse as did Andrew Brittain. However at the\nother extreme, was Andy Maynard who didn't copy down one of his checkpoints and spent\nforty-five minutes returning to the start to find out where it was.\nNext Sunday's trip will be to Thornton Park\nand -Hart's Wood in Essex. Anybody\ninterested in going, or finding out more about\nthe sport should come to the senior common room in the union building between 12:30 and\n13:30hrs today.\nNick- Watmough\nORIENTEERING\nOn Sunday the club travelled with eight\npeople to the Havering OC Club event at\nThorndon Park near Brentwood. The area of\nrun n able mixed woodland, provided reasonably demanding courses, although\nthey were perhaps a little over generous with\nthe number of controls. Performances on the\n'A' course, which the majority of people ran,\nwere mixed with times varying between fifty-six and one hundred and twenty minutes.\nSteve Kirk put in the fastest time, beating a member of the British Senior Squad - we\nthink! Ken Warren, club stalwart, had a \"crud\nrun\"; perhaps he was worrying about a potential visit from the fraud squad? Other\nperformances came from Andy Maynard, Ian\nMetcalfe and Alun Griffiths in M17.\nThe club would still welcome new\nmembers, come along and try a day in the\ncountry and perhaps you'll be bitten by the\nbug. The club meets informally every Friday\nat 12:30 in the Union Senior Common Room\non level 1. All events provide courses to suit\neveryones needs so the offer isn't open to\nonly the fit and athletic!\nINVITING\nAll Students\nTO AN .\nINTERNATIONAL\nEVENING\nON\nSATURDAY, 3RD.

    "content": "LADIES HOCKEY\nIf you read issue no 530 of FELIX you may\nhave noticed a report of the ladies hockey\nteam, in which I mentioned an earlier\nsuccess. \"What success?\" you might ask.\n(Especially if you know how much success\nthe ladies have enjoyed in the past!) Ask\nColin! Believe me he knows. He's had two\nofficial reports and a lot of unofficial hassle,\nall of which he has chosen to ignore. Well\nthey say 'third time lucky', so here\ngoes....\nOn 7 October at Motspur Park, the ladies\nhockey team took part in the University of\nLondon, seven-a side hockey tournament. In\nthe first round we played St Mary's College\nand London Hospitals 2. Having beaten them\nboth 2-1 and 4-0 respectively, we went\nthrough to the quarter-finals.\nA10 win over London Hospitals 1, lead us\non to play our arch rivals, Chelsea College in\nthe semi-finals. This game was marred by\nsome rather physical play by the opposition,\nbut our super io us skills took us on to a10 win. The final was a close game against\nUniversity College and it was not unit l the\ndying seconds of the match that Kathy\nSnook, who had scored all but two of our\ngoals, shot home a free hit from Shirley\nCourse to seal the match.\nThe shield was presented to Julia Towns,\nour captain , by Anita White, ex-England\nladies captain and UL U selector.\nFive of our players were ask d to go to UL U trials, of whom Kathy Snook, Shirley Course\nand Julia Towns were subsequently chosen\nfor the ladies squad.\nIt was nice to have some support as well,\nwith Margret Cunningham, Mr and Mrs\nCourse and our reserves staying on to the\nbitter (sweet!) end.\nTeam: Julia Towns (capt), Kathy Snook,\nCarol Thomas, Fay Hood, Cathy Crossley,\nAver il Horton, Shirley Couse, Mary Harrington, Debra Mendes, Hilary Carter and\n.Alison Oversby (umpire).\nJust to show that this was not just a flash in\nthe pan read on..;.\nIC LADIES 9 CHELSEA COLLEGE20 Last Wednesday the ladies played a cup\nmatch against Chelsea 2. From the start it was\nclear that Imperial were capable of\ndominating the game and they proceeded to\ndo so.\nThe forwards had most of the play and\nmade some good attacking moves, which left\nthe Chelsea defence stranded on more than\none o ccea sion. Some good through passes\nup the left wing were beautifully dealt with by\nWendy Slaughter. Hilary Carter was\nparticularly effective in the goal mouth,\nscoring five goals, past a Chelsea goalkeeper\nwh excelled herself, despite what the\nscore line may suggest. She dealt with\nsuccessive shots by Fay Hood from Wendy\nSlaughters corner hit outs, only to see Hilary\nCarter score from the rebound.\nIt was not until late on in the match that Fay\nHood made the score sheet when she took\nthe ball straight from the bully off, through all\nthe defence to score a very quick goal. The\nother scorers were Karen Jones (two) and\nShirley Course (penalty flick).\nTeam: Julia Towns (capt), Debra Mendes,\nKaren Jones, Fay Hood, Hilary Carter, Wendy\nSlaughter, Shirley Course, Dana Clark, Alex\nBurnip, Catherine Crossley, Averil Horton\nand Alison Oversby (umpire).\nFay Hood\nFOLK\nCLUB\nAt last I have decided to put pen to paper\nand present you with the Folk Club article.\nFirst a quick review of last Monday's concert\nfeaturing Nic Jones. For the few who turned\nup this was an excellent night of\nentertainment provided by one of the most\npopular of traditional musicians.\nNic is an accomplished performer on both\nguitar and violin as well as having that natural\nability to get an audience, whatever size, to\nsing along. He was supported by floor singers and musicians, many of whom are regulars,\nwho played a wide range of music from\ntraditional Irish folk to Don McLean.\nThis week, as an experiment, Folk Club will\nbe in the lower lounge and the bar should be\nopen. Our guest will be Dick Gaughan and all\nsingers and musicians are welcome.\nFuture guest will be Gay and Terry Woods\nof Steeleye Span fame, Martin Simpson\n(which is the Rag concert), Roaring Jelly,\nNigel Mazlyn-Jones and Dave Burland.\nAdmission is at present 25p for members and\n50p for non-mem be s BUT next term it will be\n30p and 60p except for the first night (Roaring\nJelly), which will be 50p and \u00a31.

It is curious to note that those\nletters which disagreed with my\nanalysis did not attempt to answer\nmy fundamental criticisms of the\nCC Us, ie that they possess an\ninherently tribal structure that\nthey are anti-intellectual. They\nconcentrated instead on attempting to argue that they did\nsome good work in the fields of\nsocial, academic and sporting\naffairs. In other words we have\nbeen effectively shouting past\neach other. Whether this lack of\ncounter argument on their part\nprovides further evidence for my\ncontentions regarding the CC UsI shall leave for the reader to\ndecide. In my view it does, and\nconsequently for lack of evidence\nto the contrary I reaffirm my views\non the tribal structure of the\nCC Us. Yours sincerely\nFrank James\nPS - I don't mind orange juice\nswilling people.\nWANTEDS\nEvening Bar Staff at Charrington\nBowl, Kingston Road, Tolworth.\nGood rates of pay for approx four\nhours work.

    "content": "DAY BY DAY WEDNESDAY 24\nIRA PLOT\nUS State Department officials confirmed\nuncovering a suspected IRA plot to kill\nPrincess Margaret. A high-ranking IRA man\nwas reported to be stalking her. A massive\nsecurity operation was put into action for the\nPrincess' visit including a bullet-proof car,\npolice escort (armed with submachine and\nshot guns) and ka helicopter kit ted out as an\naerial ambulance.\nSPLIT GROWS IN LABOUR PARTY\nMr Callaghan suffered his worst defeat at\nthe hands of the left wingers. The NEC set up\na fourteen member committee of inquiry into\nthe party's structure and rejected his appeal\nfor Labour MPs to have special representation. The committee is weighted\nheavily to the left: the left have a nine to five\nmajority on the team.\nBID TO SAVE PANDA\nA \u00a313million scheme to save the rare giant\npanda from extinction was launched by the\nWorld Wildlife Fund. It will involve studying\nartificial insemination and cooperation\nbetween China and the West. It is estimated\nthat four hundred pandas are in existence in\nthe wild.\nTHURSDAY 25\nULSTER CONFERENCE UNLIKELY\nMr Humphrey Atkins, Ulster Secretary, has\nannounced a plan to hold a conference of the\nfour leading parties in Ulster. The plan,\nhowever, seems unlikely to succeed as the\nOfficial Unionists have refused their\ninvitation on the grounds that decisions on\nthe future of Northern Ireland should be\nmade at Westminster not at such a conference.\nSTEEL PRODUCTION SUSPENDED\nProduction has been suspended at British\nSteel's Ravenscraig Works in Scotland. The\nsuspension which affects 11,000 jobs is\nofficially to allow a build-up of ore supplies\nwhich have been affected by a Transport and\nGeneral Workers' Union dispute.\nFRIDAY 26\nRHODESIA TALKS\nThe PF and the British government collided\nagain over the issue of British power during\nthe transition period. At the Lusaka\nConference, in Augus, Commonwealth\nleaders agreed to supervision of elections\nunder British government authority. The\nquarrel is over the definition of this\nagreement.\nLOSS OF FREE SCHOOL MEALS\nNearly half-a million children may lose the\nchance of free school meals. This is because\nof a major provision of the government's education bill intends to give parents more\nsay in the choice of their child's school and\nallow local authorities the freedom to\ncontract or scrap school meals: The bill is\ndesigned to save \u00a3220million. HEART TRANSPLANT\nMr Keith Castle, a heart transplant patient,\nleft hospital ten weeks after the operation. Mr\nCastle, 52, will have to follow a low fat diet and\nwalk two miles a day to keep fit. He has been\nadvised not to smoke, but would be allowed 'a couple of pints'.\n$3,700MILLION BLUNDER\nAmerica's central , bank, The Federal\nReserve, admitted to a$3,700 million blunder.\nThis almost certainly caused the 3/4% jump in\nUS interest rates. This error caused many\ndealers, bankers and small share holders to\ntake big losses.\nSATURDAY 27\nBONN OFFER\nGermany is willing to help Britain in its fight\nto reduce its \u00a3l,000 million yearly net\ncontribution to the EEC. This however would\nbe in exchange for a softening in London's tough stand on fishing rights. Mrs Thatcher is\nto demand that Britain should not be a net\ncontributor to the EEC. RHODESIA TALKS\nThe PF leaders threw out proposals of\nhaving a British governor during elections.\nThey insisted that elections must be\nsup rer vised by a UN force. There is no sign of\na walk out and the PF are expected to be back\nat the table when the conference resumes this\nweek.\nSUNDAY 28\nLABOUR ATTEMPT TO HEAD OFF CONFRONTATION\nAt the meeting of the Parliamentary Labour\nParty a motion is being put forward by the\nshadow cabinet calling on the executive to\nreview membership of the inquiry committee.\nLabour MPs fear that if this is passed it will\nincrease problems as the executive is unlikely\nto grant this request. Hence an amendment is\nbeing proposed to pledge the full support of\nthe P LP to the executive.\nPARK VICTIM OF PLOT\nPresident Park was a victim of a premeditated plot. He was executed by an\naide who was one of his classmates at the\nmilitary academy. This was disclosed to the\npress by a military-civilian investigation team\nset up to investigate the shooting.\nMONDAY 29\nCURB ON IMMIGRATION\nMr Whitelaw, Home Secretary, has\nannounced the government's decision that\nhusbands and fiance s will only be allowed to\nsettle in those cases when the women\nconcerned were born in this country.\nHOSPITAL DAMAGES\nDamages have been awarded against two\narea health authorities, which, because they\nare crown organizations are unable to insure\nthemselves against such losses. The cases\ninvolve almost a half a million pounds. The two .areas concerned are Kensington,\nChelsea and Westminster and Thameside.\nSTEWARDS DEFIED\nFour thousand engineering union members at Vauxhall's plant at Ellesmere\nPor t overwhelmingly to accept the company's pay offer of 17% against the\nadvice of the shop stewards. The pay offer\nhad been made, before the strike which cost\neach man about \u00a3600.\nTUESDAY 30\nFRANCE'S LAMB BAN\nThe French government defied a European\ncourt ban on its restrictions on British lamb\nimports. At a meeting of EEC farm ministers,\nthe British minister, Mr Walker, said that the\nEEC, \"states catastrophe in the face\" and the\nfarm commissioner said that the ban could\nlead to the collapse of the common\nagricultural policy.\nECONOMIC RECESSION\nFollowing the publication of a sur very by\nthe CBI showing that the economy was\nleading for the worst recession for five years,\nSir Ray Pannock, CB I President-Elect,\nappealed to management and Unions to get\ntogether and solve the industrial problems.\nThe sur very painted a bleak picture of rising\nunemployment, reduced output and poor\nexport prospects.\nINTRODUCING FAGGING\nFour hundred students of North Staffordshire Polytechnic decided at a meeting to introduce fagging. First year\nstudents would become fags for final year\nstudents and their duties will include tea\nmaking, floor wiping, washing laundry, shoe\ncleaning and making stimulating conversation. Mr Paul Davies, a modern\nstudies student, who dreamt up the idea said\nthat it was a return to the great British\ntradition and it was a positive contribution\ntowards Britain becoming great again. He\nthought the students studying for exams\nwould be able to study in the right\natmosphere without bothering about 'menial\nchores'.\n7\n\n"
