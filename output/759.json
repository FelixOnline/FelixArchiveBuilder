    "content": "ClubS_ FELIX, Friday January 16th198710 FilmSoc\nIC Fim Society's next presentation,\nthis coming Thursday the 22nd in\nPhysics LT1 (doors 6.30pm) is\nWeird Science (15)\nWeird Science is a hilariously\nfunny comedy about Gary and\nWyatt; two nice, well-brought-up.\nbut slightly nerdy kids. The only\ntrouble is, not one girl in their entire\nschool will look at either of them. In\ndesperation they make their own\ngirl on Wyatt's computer. Not a picture of a girl on the VDU,\nunderstand, a real girl. The film\nstars Kelly LeBrock (from The\nWoman In Red) who portrays \"the\nperfect woman\"\nThe following Thursday's film,\nagain in Physic LT1 in the evening is\nBeverly Hills Cop, starring Eddie\nMurphy, a brilliant comedy\u2014\nmelodrama with farcical elements\nand a lively music score.\nAlso coming this term are two of\nthe best films of 86: Jagged Edge\nstarring Jeff Bridges and Glen\nClose, and John Hustons Prizzis\nHonour with Jack Nicholson and\nKathleen Turner.\nSee posters for further details of\nFilm Society's presentations\u2014and\nplease do come along\u2014its a inexpensive, very enjoyable evening\nout.\nChinese\nChess\nGo and Hsiangchi are vastly\ndifferent strategy games for two\nplayers. They were both invented\nseveral thousand years ago in the\nFar East and while Go has survived\nvirtually unchanged from its\noriginal form, Hsiangchi has\nundergone many changes down the\nages and is the forerunner of\nmodern 'western' chess. It is still\nwidely played in the Far East, and\nwestern chess players will notice\nimmediately the similarities between\neastern and western versions.\nWhile Hsiangchi spread to the\nWest to evolve into western chess,\nGo did not spread, and while it is\nnow arguably the foremost board\ngame in Japan and China, few\nwesterners have heard of Go. This is\na pity because, for the people who\nplay it, it is easily the greatest board\ngame in the world. (Hsiangchi and\nchess players may disagree!). I will\nspare you technical details except to\nsay that Go takes about five minutes\nto learn, Hsiangchi a little longer,\nand both take anything over an hour\nto play.\nThe Chinese Chess Society exists\nto promote both of these games and\nmeetings are held during Tuesday\nand Wednesday lunchtimes in\nMaths 341 from 12.40. Beginners\nare most welcome: we have many\nFilmSoc presents 'Jagged Edge' starring Jeff Bridges and Glen\nClose, the psychological-mystery-thriller\ncompetent players of both games\nand full instruction is given to new\nmembers.\nSo, if you're fed up with being fed\nup at lunchtime come along and be\ninterested instead. See you there.\nChris Eardley EE2\nAmateur\nRadio\nContrary to popular belief\nHAMSOC\u2014the Amateur Radio\nSociety\u2014is alive and bleeping. We\nmeet every Wednesday at 12.30 in\nthe Hamsoc Shack in the Union\nbuilding (lift level 3).

The\npitch at Harlington was frozen\nsolid, as were many of the players,\nwith snow falling throughout much\nof the game.\nThe first half was fairly even, both\nsides having scoring chances. At\nhalf time, however, the IC team led\nby one goal scored by their dynamic\nstriker, Richard Ellis.\nThe second half saw that RSM\nhad by no means given up. Several\nbreaks into the IC goal area finally\nresulted in the equalise r scored by\nMark Rayfield. The second goal\ncame from a penalty taken by\nSimon Otto, following an incident\nin which Andy Lewis was brought\ndown by IC's goalkeeper.\n\n"

    "content": "Letters. FELIX, Friday January 16th19872 Report\nDefended\nDear David,\nI would like to defend Mark\nCottle's report of the last Council in\nFELIX. As Council Chair I was in\nthe best position to judge what\nprompted Ian Howgate's protest. It\nwas my ruling that minutes of subcommittees of Council cannot be\nreferred back. Mr Howgate\nsuggested that the Academic affairs\nOfficer's report should be referred\nback. There was no AAO's report\nsubmitted to Council so I assumed\nthat Mr Howgate was talking about\nthe minutes of the Academic Affairs\nCommittee. It amazes me that Mr\nHowgate cannot distinguish\nbetween minutes and a report.\nCouncil minutes cannot be referred\nback because Council is meant to\ndiscuss the decisions made by its\nsub-committees. If one refers back\nto the minutes it means Council\ncan't discuss what is being done in\nits name for a month. Council is not\nmeant to discuss the accuracy of\nminutes.\nMr Howgate's walk out showed a complete lack of understanding of\nthe way council works. If Mr\nHowgate disagrees with the\ndecisions I make about the running\nof Council, he can challenge my\nruling. This means that had the\nmajority of Council wanted subcommittee minutes referred back it\ncould have happened. I am more\nthan willing to explain how Council\nworks to Mr Howgate or anyone\nelse.\nThere also seems to be some silly\nidea that all minutes, reports etc\nshould be circulated a week in\nadvance. Ideally they should, but\noften sub-committee meetings take\nplace less than a week before\nCouncil. Council's most important\njob is to control finance. The\ncommittee that advises Council on\nthis, Union Finance Committee\n(UFC), meets three days before\nCouncil. Finance decisions have to\nbe noted by Council almost\nimmediately if Council is to have a chance to alter UFC's decision. It\nwould be stupid for Council to\nconsider UFC's decisions about a month after they were taken. In\naddition, the minutes for the last\nminutes were not produced because\nDave Colley was ill.\nI could criticise other statements\nmade by Mr Howgate, Mr Seymour\nand Mr Brandon but I won't because I'm sure that you are\nalready bored with what seems like\npetty bitching. Perhaps people\nshould consider promoting the\nUnion rather than bitching in\nFELIX. Bitching just makes the\nUnion look stupid.\nYours\nD Hugh Southey\nCouncil Chair\nHowgate\nBombarded\nDear Dave,\nI feel it has reached the point\nwhere I have undergone about as\nmuch bombardment as it is possible\nto take. Therefore, if anyone is\ninterested, I would like to point out\nthe actual reasons why I left the last\nmeeting of Union Council. As has\nbeen pointed out by certain\nmembers of that committee, papers\n(which number around 20 sides of\nA4) were handed out on the day of\nthat meeting. Approximately 50%\nof these were available on entry, the\nresult was that representatives could\nnot consult their const it u en ces about the information included,\nlook into problems more deeply or\npersonally research anything; in\nsome cases the papers could not\neven be read. This was the second\ntime in succession that this had\noccured; I work very hard as Dep\nRep and have better things to do\nthan waste time (around 3 hours)\nturning over pieces of paper that I have not had time to read. For\nCouncil to pass this literature\nwithout proper discussion makes\nCouncil a 'farce', which was my\npoint at the time. Very few Dep\nReps even turn up to council, as they\nbelieve it achieves little of relevance\nto their constituency, and if\ninformation upon council is of such\na limited extent as has been the case\nat the last two meetings I must agree\nwith my absent colleagues. I was\nwrong to leave the council at that\nstage as I should have stood up for\nmy principles. I have learned this\nlesson and have realised how much\nthe truth can be distorted in one's absence. Nevertheless council have\ndecided in my absence to improve\nthe distribution of papers.\nAs for electioneering I happily\nadmit that I am likely to stand for\nPresident this term, but to suggest\nmy actions at the last Council were\ncarried out with this intent is a joke;\nthis was a gut-reaction to a situation\nwhich at the time appalled me. I would like to say that I did not\n'attack' anyone, I feel Chas\nJackson, (Publicity Officer) has\ndone a good job so far, but that he is\nnot supported enough and\nsuggested ways he might help\nhimself deal with his workload, he\nhimself said at a later date, he did\nnot feel he had been s lagged off. My\nactions were not an attack on Hugh\nSouthey, who I feel has done well, or\nthe exec, who have stood up for us\nbetter than most would realise. I do\nhowever feel they were mis-guided\nin allowing Council to take place\nunder these circumstances, but that\nis all. At the same time I am not\nfrightened to stand up alone if\nnecessary for what I feel is right.\nI am sorry to see that Mark Cottle\nhas decided to leave his job\nunfinished and hope his\nreplacement is enthusiastic; I look\nforward to working with whoever it\nmay be as most Council should do,\nfor this is where Our strength lies,\nsquabbling and petty accusations\nact only to aid our enemies.\nThe only advice I wish to give Pete\nWilson is that people who live in\nglass houses should not throw\nstones.\nYours, Ian Howgate\nIn Defence\nDear Dave.\nReferring to the article titled\n\"Shallow Policy of Electioneers\" in\nFelix No 758 (page 2), I would like\nto point out some of the facts the\nwriter of this article failed to see.\nMost suggestions (attacks?) need\nnot be considered as personal at all,\nespecially regarding people holding\nUnion posts. Now as for Mr Chas\nJackson, unless he has a publicity\nteam, I would conclude that he does\nall the \"smooth running\" of\npublicity as a one-man team (alone).\nI am sure most people would agree\nwith my understanding of Ian\nHowgate's suggestion, i.e.a commit te would function much\nbetter than Chas \"alone\", isn't that\nobvious to you Mr Wilson? That\ncould also cut down the time Chas\nspends making and distributing\nposters, at the expense of his\nvaluable study time. In addition,\nthat would also provide Mr Jackson\nwith enough time to spend oh\ndesigning good quality posters, and\nsurprise surprise, the committee\nwould do the distribution for him!\nLastly, I won't be surprised in the\nleast, if you Mr Wilson, don't \"Vote Howgate for President - the\nman who sets up committees,\"\nbecause they are personal attacks on\nother students (??). Don't forget that\nif we can reduce the amount of work\ndone by an individual, there could\nbe a much better chance to get\npeople \"out of goodwill,\" who can\noffer best services to the Union, and\nhence that may keep Ian Howgate\nand you happy!!\nYours faithfully,\nAbby Amustila Materials II\nNUS And\nAbortion\nDear Sir,\nArguments about the pros and\ncons of the NUS are usually draped\nin political colours. This need not\nalways be the case, however.\nThe NUS annually donates \u00a3 1000\nof its funds to the National\nAbortion Campaign (NAC) and\nactively supports its policies which\ninclude:\na) Introduction of legislation\nwhich would allow anyone,\nincluding non-medical persons, to\nperform abortions.\nb) Abortion on demand up to\nbirth with no medical or legal\nrestrictions.\nYou don't have to be vehemently\nagainst abortion to acknowledge the\nextremity of such policies, if only in\nthe fact that they would pose a severe health hazard to women\nprocuring abortions from untrained\npeople, or even carrying it out\nthemselves.\nMoreover, among the aims of the\nNAC, is that \"all anti-abortion\ndoctors holding positions in which\nthey can directly or indirectly\nobstruct a woman seeking an\nabortion are to be removed from\nsuch posts\". This seems to deny the\nright of conscientious objection to\nany pro-life doctors as well as to\nsome of the 27,000 medical students\nwithin the NUS. There are pro-life\nstudents on both sides of the\npolitical divide, as I witnessed when\nI attended a pro-life student vigil\nnear \"Little Ben\" at Victoria Station\nat the end of last term (see \"feminists\nturn against abortion\" - Daily\nTelegraph, December 23rd). Indeed, such students will stand for\nexecutive posts on the NUS at the\nEaster Conference in March. They\nmay not get very far, but they will\nshow that you don't have to be a rabid fascist -to have disagreements\nwith the NUS.\nYours sincerely,\nPaul Kapusta\nChairman, IC Positive Alternatives to Abortion Society (PATA)\nToken Wacky\nLetter\nDear Dave,\nAfter the flood of letters last week\nregarding Ian R.M. Howgate\n(henceforth I. R.M. H.)I think it is\ntime to inform you of the actual\nstate of affairs. There is no I.R. M.H. publicity machine, there is, however\nan organisation which people might\nassume to fulfill its duties - the\ncommit te to elect I.R. M.H. As yet\nthe committee's activities have been\ncovert although some suspicious\nsouls have begun to detect its\nexistence.\nAll I can say at present is that if\npeople think this powerful\nundercover organisation's activities\nto date have been ruthless they\nshould wait and see what happens\nwhen it comes into the open.\nYours,\nDavid Lowrie,\nChairman,\nCommittee to Elect (A. A.O) Letters continued on page 4\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews FELIX, Friday January 16th19879 New\nReleases\nThe idea of 'technology running\namok' has become popular recently\nwith films like Wargames and Blue\nThunder, both directed by John\nBadham. He contrives the theme in\nhis latest film, Short Circuit, which\nconcerns the world of robotic\narmaments. Unfortunately, where\nhis previous films have had a certain\namount of technical credibility,\nShort Circuit is far less convincing,\nalthough admittedly less serious.\n'Number Five' is an artificially\nintelligent weapons system, a robot\nRambo, which, after being struck by\nlightning, escapes it's secret testing\nground and decides it would rather\npick flowers and look at butterflies\nthan zap people with its built-in\nlaser. To this end it is befriended by\nStephanie Speck, a \"cute all-American single girl\" and animal\nlover, who becomes convinced that\nthe robot is 'alive'. Meanwhile it is\nbeing tracked down by its inventor,\nNewton Crosby, and a gang of\nbungling security men. After the\ncompulsory sequences of chases and\nlaser battles Stephanie manages to\npersuade Newton Crosby that\nNumber Five really is 'alive' and\ntogether they try and save it from\nbeing 'disassembled'.\nIf you're prepared to put up with\nthe rather predictable plot,\nstereotyped characters, and a horrendously cute robot (metalic\nET), then Short Circuit is quite good\nfun, making up for what it lacks in\nother areas with a witty script and\nfast pace. It is one of those films\nwhere you just know who's going to\nlive happily ever after with who.\nAlly Sheedy as\nStephanie\nDo you remember going to\npantomimes when you were little?\nThere was something for everyone.\nYour Dad could ogle at the\nprincipal boy, your Mum could go\nout because you weren't around or\nshe could laugh at the comedians,\nyou could shout and sing along with\nthe actors. The Golden Child is a sort of pantomime film. There's special effects and a child hero to\nappeal to the younger audience.\nThere's Eddie Murphy to appeal to\nthe teenagers. There's a beautiful\nwoman who gets covered in water\n(the wet T shirt look) for the dirty\nold men. There's a love story.\nUnfortunately this cocktail of\neverything doesn't work. The\nGolden Child is not up to the\nstandard of previous Eddie Murphy\nfilms (even 'Best Defence').\nThe Golden Child is meant to be\nfunny, but apart from one five\nminute scene, it drags. The problem\nis that Eddie Murphy is at his best\nwhen be is wisecracking and in this\nfilm he is rarely given the chance to\nwisecrack. He spends most of his\ntime on a fairly boring trail chasing\nafter a child. He is faced by a variety\nof supernatural enemies. The film is\nbasically a poor adventure movie.\nThe special effects are quite good\nbut are so infrequent that they don't really make the film special. The\nstory line is boring.\nThe Golden Child will probably\nbe a huge box office success. People\ngo and see Eddie Murphy whatever\nthe reviews say. Most people who go\nwill, I believe, be d is a pointed. The\nfilm has got the ingredients of a good film, it just hasn't mixed them\nproperly.\nHugh Southey\nKaren Silkwood was a socially\noutcast power worker who\nuncovered faults at her plant that\nwere being ignored by the company.\nShe was murdered whilst travelling\nto meet a reporter from 'The New\nYork Times' and the evidence that\nshe had with her disappeared. Her\nstory was filmed as \"Silkwood\", one\nof the most powerful and\ncontroversial films of the 80's. The team that produced\n\"Silkwood\" reformed to make\n\"Heartburn\". This time Meryl\nStreep plays a cookery writer who,\nagainst her better judgement\nmarries playboy Jack Nicholson,\nand for a while they live in bliss, but\ntheir marriage quickly falls apart.\nDirector Mike Nichols seems\nunable to decide whether to treat the\nstory as a yuppie tear-jerk er or a satire. Nora Ephorn's script is based\nupon her own marriage and\nconsequently is a confused mixture\nof emotions which does not make\ngood cinema, the unsatisfactory\nending even suggests that the whole\nmovie is an allegory of the childrens'\nrhyme about a spider! However\n\"Heartburn\" does have some spice y comic moments which keep the\naudience laughing along, until, at\nthe end, we realise how vacant and\nspineless it all is.\nHollywood stars do not make\ncontroversial films in case they lose\ntheir audience and consequently\nwork. Streep, who is brilliant when\nplaying flawed women surviving\nagainst all odds, now appears only\nin mindless, if expensive, films that\nare unworthy of her immense\ndramatic skills.\nIt is unbelievable that the talented\ngroup of people that made\n\"Silkwood\" can fall to such depths.\nThe advertising ought to warn that\n\"Heartburn\" is not only irritating it\ncan also make you sick.\nTheatre: Triumph at The Gate\nWhen I saw the excellent reviews\nof \"Triumph of Love\" by Michael\nBillington of the Guardian and\nMichael Ratcliffe of the Observer it\ndid cross my mind to hand in their\ncollective opus, but instead I give\nyou my equally prestigious (well\nalmost) contribution.\nIf you want to see what London\nFringe Theatre is about then you\ncouldn't do better than to go to the\nGate Theatre in Pembridge Road,\nNotting Hill Gate. This play\nfurthers the reputation being built\nup at the Gate Theatre (they\nreceived the Time Out Fringe\nAward for best venue of 1986).\nThere are four reasons for this.\nFirstly, you will see a British\npremiere of a play frequently shown\nabroad.\nSecondly, the visiting Anchor and\nDolphin theatre company present\ntheir new translation of a piece by\nthe much neglected (in this country)\nMarivaux.\nThirdly, you'll see the contrast\nbetween the expensive West End\ntheatres with their lavish but dull\nand tourist y productions and the\nsmall scale professional theatre that\nis prepared to put on something\nnew.\nFourthly, the pub downstairs is\npretty good.\nThe play itself is about a young\nqueen who finds herself falling in\nlove with a you nd man who her own\nfamily have mistreated. This neatly\nfits in with her dislike of the injustice\ndone to him and so she decides to\nwin his love and make him king.\nThis sound simple enough but\nunfortunately the young man is\nlooked after by a somewhat chaste\nphilosopher and the equally chaste\nphilosopher's sister.\nMarivaux is never one to shy from\na bit of complexity and so the\nphilosopher and his sister find\nthemselves both being seduced by\nthe not so truthful queen. Whether\nreason defeats manipulation you'll\nhave to find out for yourselves.\nThe success of the play is highly\ndependent on the ability of the main\nactress. Anchor and Dolphin have\nfound a fine actress in the form of\nHarriet Keevil who deserves a mention. She pulls this well directed\nplay along very skilfully. There are\nalso some good supporting\nperformances.\nThe play is a thoughtful comedy\nwhich may well introduce the\naudience to a commedia dell'arte\nstyle. If you want to know the\nsignificance of the masked character\nthen I refer you to the\ncomprehensive programme which\ncovers it better than I can.\nAll in all, this makes for an\nenjoyable evening's entertainment\nas both myself, several IC students\nand the Guardian and Observer\ncritics can testify. Its certainly\nprofessional and it'll certainly make\nyou laugh. I understand that\naudiences are steadily growing but\nyou have until the 31st Jan to see it.\n\n"

    "content": "Featura FELIX, Friday January 16th19876 THEY CAME\nFROM OUTER SPACE\nA cynic's eye\nguide to the\nUFO\ncontroversy.\nBy\nChris Edwards\nUFO's have been reported and\nconjectured on for centuries.\nEzekiels' hovering chariot has long\nbeen theorised about - in Von\nDariker's discredited books it was a flying saucer, in the Bible, an agent\nof God. The refusal of governments\nto investigate the phenomena to any\ngreat degree has led to allegations of\na cover-up campaign - that aliens\nhave visited but that the evidence\nhas been destroyed or hidden.\nThe Carter administration was\nembarrassed when, after promising\nto release the Blue Book files, found\nthat many of them had been lost.\nProject Blue Book was a USAF file\nkept on UFO's which largely\nestablished natural causes for\nUFO's, but left a few sightings\nunanswered.\nThe first UFO's to be sighted and\nnot to be attributed to enemy\naircraft were soon after the\ndr ppp ing of the A bomb on\nHiroshima - just as mysterious\ndisappearances in the Bermuda\nTriangle were rising to a new\npopularity. For a long time, flying\nsaucers, the Bermuda and Devil's Triangle (in the China Sea) were\nconnected in the popular\nimagination as being part of a plot\nby extraterrestrials to study\nhumanity.\nOver the years, the UFO story has\ndone more to show what people are\nprepared to believe in if they want\nto, than to indicate if technological\nraces other than humanity exist. The\nmost frequent sightings occur in\nNorth America and likewise the\nmost fervent belief in the theory that\nUFO's really are messages from\nother worlds. This may be linked to\na recent survey of students in\nAmerican universities reported in\nthe Times December 6th which\nstated that an alarming number of\nstudents believed unequivocally in\nGenesis and the existence of\nparanormal phenomena.\nWhile it might seem unfair to link\nbelief in a God with belief in visiting\nextraterrestrials, the two\nphilosophies have remarkably\nsimilar properties. Few UFO buffs\nwould disagree with the hypothesis\nthat extraterrestrials are benevolent\nand only too willing to help\nmankind - a feeling shared by people\nlike Carl Sagan and Dr Alan Hynek.\nMore fanatical believers are of the\nopinion that these aliens have a mission to save humanity from\nitself. Here Christian style religions\nseem to have left their mark, with a fervent belief in \"original sin\" and\nthe inability of mankind to avoid\nself-destruction. Many of these\ntheories seem to share similarities\nwith C.S. Lewis' book Out of the\nSilent Planet, where Earth's supposed twin Venus is an un fallen Eden inhabited by angelic beings,\nright down to the frequent story that\nJesus was a Venusian astronaut.\nStories of \"close encounters of the\nthird kind\" - where alien beings\ncontact humans personally - often\nshow similar patterns as well as a singular lack of imagination. The\nextraterrestrials are almost always\nhuman is ed, frequently \"spindly,\nshimmering beings of unearthly\nbeauty\", that kidnap humans either\nto study them, or to give them\nmessages to relay and are then\nreturned. The two most famous\noccur en ces of this are those of a man\nwho called himself simply \"David\"\nand the \"cosmic\" jazz musician Sun\nRa. \"David\" returned as a prophet\nof salvation by the aliens wearing\ntheir symbol - af yl fot. The f yl fot is\nquite a terrestrial symbol of good\nluck, used for over two thousand\nyears in Indo-European cultures (it\nis the mirror image of the swastika -a familiar black magic symbol). Sun\nRa claimed that he had been\n\"transported into space on an\nenergy beam\", where he was\n\"transformed into a member of the\nAngel race and given a mission on\nEarth - to make space music.\"\nAll of the evidence for flying\nsaucers so far is circumstantial\nalthough quite serious attempts\nhave been made to find evidence of\nintelligent extraterrestrial life. In the\nmid-60's a series of radio-sources\nwere discovered that transmitted\nregular pulses of radiation on a micro-second scale. They were at\nfirst attributed to intelligent life, but\nquickly found to be caused by\nrapidly spinning, ultra dense neutron stars which act like massive\nlighthouses. In 1960 Project Ozma\nwas undertaken to search for signals\nof life in space, as well as the\nsuggestion that a permanent array\nof one hundred ante nae be used for\nthis purpose \u2014 called Project\nCyclops. This is a yet un realised project despite extensive lobbying\nby people such as Carl Sagan, a keen\nexponent of communication with\nother races. Sagan believes that a race capable of interstellar\ncommunication and even travel\nmust have overcome problems of\nself-annihilation and could even\noffer advice. The fact that we seem\n\n"

    "content": "Felix FELIX, Friday January 16th19875 UGM\nsketch\nThe first Union General Meeting\nof 1987 saw another disappointing\nturnout, much to the sha grin of Hon\nSec Dave Colley. Dave was slightly\nover-optimistic in his estimation of\nattendance after last week's FELIX\nfaux pas advertising FREE beer at\nthe meeting. He asked College to set\nout 200 extra chairs in order to seat\nthe hoards in addition to the 288\nfixed chairs. Obviously nobody\nreads FELIX because less than 100\nmanaged to make it. Where were the\nthousands? Quite obviously stuck in\na snow drift somewhere, or eating\nQT burgers.\nPresident Christine Taig reported\non her long talks with Assistant\nCollege Secretary, Michael Arthur,\nher long talks with the Rector, and\nher long talks with just about\neverybody else who is anybody. She\nalso hinted at more rent rises if 200\nplaces are taken on in Evelyn\nWhere were all the\nthousands?\nGardens. Talking of the \"amazing\nopportunity\" of gaining more basic\naccommodation, she proclaimed\nthat she had a \"gut feeling that it\nwas worth the subsidy\" and that\n\"we should go for it\".\nAfter Christine's question and\nanswer session, the meeting was\ngraced by an exhibition of modern\ntechnology when Mines President\nRob Perry's personal portable\ntelephone rang with a call for ex-External Affairs Officer, Mark\nIt's for you-oo. . . MC phone home\nCottle (successor was elected later\non in the meeting with his best mate\nand drinking buddy, Adrian 'Jelly'\nJohnson winning by a narrow\nmargin).\nThis interlude was short-lived and\nvoices were raised during Deputy\nPresident Jackie Peirce's report to\nthe meeting. Eric the Rector sent a letter to all Heads of Departments\nsaying that the decision to alter the\nJCR has been passed despite the\nUnion's protestations. This has\nupset Ms Peirce after the long\nwrangling s over the ownership of\nthe QT Burger Bar and its\nencroachment into Union Space.\nJackie threw the debate open to the\nfloor with \"does anybody really care\nabout the JCR and QT?\" The\ndiscussion was polarised between\nthe militants who wanted to take\nover QT (and even the entire College\nRefectory system) and those who\ndidn't seem to care about the loss of\nUnion revenue describing Union\nmoves as \"sour grapes\" because QT\nwas making so much money. The\ndebate rages on after a motion\nproposed by Steve Mercer to hold\nan emergency general meeting in the\nJCR one lunchtime was passed. It is\nreckoned generally that this meeting\nwill surely be quo rate even if half the\npeople are only there to eat QT\nburgers. By this time the meeting\nbecame well bogged down by\nprocedure. RCS President Simon\nSingh proposed that an opinion poll\nshould be carried out by the\nExecutive to discover the general\nconcensus of the student body about\nthe JCR, and whether a week-long\nboycott would be supported. More\namendments were proposed which\nwere defeated but the final notion\nwas passed leaving everybody\nunsure of what was actually going to\nhappen.\nDuring Hon Sec Dave Colley's report the old chestnut of Linstead\nLocks was raised again with College\ninertia being blamed for the gap of\ntwo years between the master key\nbeing stolen and the locks finally\nbeing changed. Welfare Officer,\nTom Melliar-Smith, cynically\nproclaimed that College were only\nprepared to change the locks after\nbelongings were stolen from guests\nof the Summer Accommodation\nCentre. Estimations of when this\nwill be occur ing ranged from the\nofficial line of \"within a month\" to\nTom's guess at by the Summer\nTerm.\nThe guest speaker, Lynda\nO 'Leary from ULU, gained cat-calls\nfrom her audience but very little\nverbal support for her calls for\nphysical campaigning against UL U cuts of 50%. The most favorable\nsuggestion was that of ULU's postcard campaign \u2014 \"basically\nsigning lots of postcards and\ndumping them on the Chairman's doorstep\". She also suggested a library work-in: \"you don't actually\nhave to do any work. Just say that\nyou're occupying it because you like\nlibraries\".\nAfter the UL U motion was\n\"does anybody really\ncare?\"\npassed and the election had taken\nplace, local hero Simon Bosher\nproposed holding a24 hour work-in, as suggested by the Rector this\ntime last year, to a large amount of\ngeneral derision from the rest of the\n50 or so people left in the hall at\n2.25pm. It was of course worth\nlaying a bet on the fact that John\nRanson would once again call\n\"quorum\" when it reached a Bosher\nmotion. Simon has to be almost as\npopular as a QT burger!\nPerusing the beverages on offer at\nthe Annual Piestazenyoot Beer\nFestival Mobius (the infamous\npuzzle solver) and I spotted an\nattractive offer:\nWIN A BARREL OF BEER\nThere was already quite a crowd\ngathered around the table, but we\nmanaged to find out the following:\nin front of the barrel were two\nmeasures, one of five pints and one\nof three pints and the challenge was,\nusing the two measures and the\nbarrel as your only implements, to\ntransfer beer around so as to end up\nwith just one pint in each of the\nmeasures (pouring beer away was\nallowed). Various people had failed\ndismally and their beer was poured\nback into the barrel so that the next\nperson could try. It's a bit of a con,\nbecause to solve the problem you\nhave to use a trick nobody in their\nright mind would consider, but if\nyou can gather up a group of thirsty\npeople I reckon we can get round it!\nMobius managed to solve the\nproblem, although we didn't take\nthe barrel home with us, how did he\ndo it?\nAnswers, new problems,\ncomments, etc to the FELIX Office\nby 1.00pm Wednesday, please.

    "content": "News FELIX, Friday January 16th198712 Upstairs, Downstairs\nResidents in Southside have signed a petition expressing opposition to the\nproposed introduction of staircase\nkitchens in the hall. Instead, Tizard\n& Selkirk residents are pressing the\nCollege to build an extra gallery\nlevel kitchen in the space formally\noccupied by the laundry, and they\npropose that the staircase fridges be\nreplaced by individual fridges in\neach room. The petition, which has\nbeen signed by almost all of the\nTizard residents is due to be\npresented to the Students Residence\nCommittee when they meet to\ndiscuss the matter next week.\nThe Wardens' Sub-committee\nendorsed the plans for gallery level\nkitchens at a meeting on\nWednesday, when it was decided\nthat individual fridges could be paid\nfor by increasing the weekly rent by\n50p per week.\nThe Managing Surveyor of\nResidences, Mr Peter Hallworth, is\nunderstood to be in favour of\nstaircase kitchens and has listed a number of objections to individual\nfridges. In a report assessing the\ncosts of three proposals to re house the staircase fridges \u2014 a move\nwhich is necessary to comply with\nfire regulations \u2014 Mr Hallworth\npoints out that individual fridges\nwould be costly to maintain, would\nencourage students to cook in\nrooms, and would present a pest\nhazard. The report estimates the\ncosts of providing individual fridges\nas \u00a360,000 and re housing the fridges\nin cupboards on the staircase as\n\u00a332,000, and installing kitchens in\ngallery level as \u00a333,300.\nThe provision of new kitchens in\nTizard and Selkirk was first\ndiscussed by the SRC last year when\nit was decided that gallery level\nkitchens should be built. Work on\nthe kitchens did not go ahead,\naccording to Mr Hallworth, because\nthe problem of where to relocate the\nstaircase fridges had not been\nresolved, and because of alleged\nobstruction by Southside Warden\nDr Hutchinson.\nInformal meetings between the\nwardens and College Deputy\nSecretary Mr Brian Lloyd Davies\nwere held during the Christmas\nbreak. It was decided, in the light of\nPeter Hallworth's objections to\ngallery level kitchens, that the SRC\nshould consider the issue, taking the\ncosts of alternative proposals into\naccount.\nA spokesman from the Tizard\nHall Committee said he was\ndisappointed with the lack of\nprogress made in refurbishing the\nkitchens and said that it was\nunfortunate that the issue had to be\nreferred back to the SRC.\nGrant\nInadequate\nThe All-party Education Select\nCommittee has accused the\nDepartment of Education and\nScience (DES) of misleading parents\nover the adequacy of the student\ngrant. The Committee also\nunanimously criticised the\nDepartment's failure to collect\nevidence and keep statistics on\nstudents' financial needs.\nThe Committee's report, which\nwas presented to Parliament on\nTuesday, supported the principle of\nfull grants for almost all students,\nbut acknowledged that the cost of \u00a33\nmillion would be impossible to\nmeet.\nThe DES admits that the present\ncost of living calculations are\n\"entirely national\" and the report\nproposes that a \"student cost of\nliving index\" be set up. Middle class\nfamilies would also be assessed\nmore generously if the report's suggestions are accepted\nThe report has been favourably\nreceived by the NUS and the Labour\nParty, which described it as \"a sharp\nrebuke to the government over its\npolicy on student grants\".\nIn The Pits\nDave Colley announced at\nyesterday'sU GM that, considering\nA A recommendations, the Union\nvan fleet would be off the road for\nthe duration of the bad weather.\nRose Atkins joined the FELIX staff as the new Phototypesetter Operator on\nMonday. Rose, who lives in Mitcham, is looking forward to operating the brand\nnew Compugraphic Typesetter.\nIC Tomb Horror\nThree Imperial College students\nwere found dead from hypothermia\nthis week. The three, who all lived in\nthe same flat in Lexham Gardens,\nwere found huddled together for\nwarmth in their sub-zero unheated\nflat, with their feet poked inside the\nkitchen oven. Students Union\nknow-alls, Ian Howgate and Alan\nRose, commented \"this is an\nabsolutely disgusting state of\naffairs\", and we are going to further\nour sabbatical election campaigns\nby criticising whatever Christine\ndoes about it\".\nConditions in the 25 Lexham\nGardens flats have always been\ndescribed as \"chilly\", but the latest\narctic weather has prompted calls\nfor issuing free thermal\ncombinations to all tenants. This is a little late for the three victims, and\nfor the students in flat six, who are\nbelieved to be suffering frostbite in\nseveral places. Student services are\nadvertising the empty flat later this\nweek.\nAIDS Leaflet\nThe Government's AIDS leaflets\nhave been distributed to Falmouth\nKeogh Hall this week. Lesley\nGillingham, the Student Accommodation Officer, continuing her role as Welfare Adviser,\nsaid that the leaflets were a good\nidea and added that plans to leaflet\nother residences were under\nconsideration.\nTV Fees\nIncrease\nThe membership fees for Imperial\nCollege Radio and STOIC will be\nincreased to \u00a34, it was decided at\nTuesday's Union Finance\nCommittee. Union Deputy\nPresident, Jackie Peirce, said that\nthe \u00a31.50 increase was necessary to\npay for the high cost of the\nequipment used by both of the\nclubs. She added that, because\nneither STOIC and IC Radio were\nessential services, it was reasonable\nfor students to help finance the\nequipment.\nIC Radio Station Manager, Pete\nHands, described the move as \"very\nsad\" and pointed out that students\nwould be discouraged from joining\nIC Radio as a result.\nNew Places\nThe College is negotiating to buy\na200 place hall of residence in the\nlocality. The hall will be financed in\npart by the letting of rooms in\nEvelyn Gardens, Beit Hall and\nGarden Hall during the Easter\nholidays \u2014 a move which is\nexpected to raise an extra \u00a325,000\nper year.\nFire regulations dictate that the\nresidences cannot be let to the\ngeneral public, and it is anticipated\nthat the facilities will mainly be used\nby visiting foreign students.\nIn previous years the halls have\nbeen let out only in summer, under\nthe control of the Student Manager.\nThe College is now considering\ndelegating the scheme to the\nConference Office in order to\nprevent the incidents of student\nrowdiness which resulted in damage\nto halls last summer.\n\n"

The meeting, which will take\nplace at 12.30pm in the JCR, has been\nconvened to gauge student opinion on\na boycott of the QT snack bar.\nThe Union are unhappy about the\nCollege's decision to backtrack on\nits plans to swap the JCR with the\nSherfield Refectory \u2014 a move which\ntook place in the light of an\nunexpected increase in the number\nof students using refectories. They\nare particularly concerned that\nCollege has not taken the Union's viewpoint seriously, and that\nrequests for compensation for the\nloss of space in the JCR have been\nignored. It is now unlikely that\nstudents will be allowed to use the\nSCR given the staffs opposition to\nthe conversion of the SCR into a refectory.\nA boycott is likely to have a serious effect on the refectory\nincome; currently the snack bar has\na turnover of \u00a31700 per day, with\nweekly staff costs of \u00a31200. Union\nDeputy President, Jackie Peirce\nbelieves that a boycott would give\nthe Union leverage to claim greater\ncontrol of the JCR bar. \"Unless we\nkick them where it hurts \u2014 in the\nwallet \u2014 the College will continue\nto ignore us,\" she said.\nFollowing an open meeting last\nterm, the Rector, Professor Eric Ash\nhas suggested that the Senior\nCommon Room should not be\nconverted into a refectory for\nstudents and staff, as had been\nproposed. In a letter delivered to the\nheads of department Professor Ash\nsaid that salads should be served in\nthe SCR for staff only, and added,\n\"We will not introduce grills and\nwith them the possibility of students\njoining us.\" Instead the Rector\nproposes that grills be served from\nthe Sherfield Refectory.\nIn addition the Rector has\nsuggested that the staff make use of\ncommon rooms in the departments.\nAn 'SCR Coffee Club' would be\ncreated to encourage academics to\ntour the coffee rooms and to\npromote social intercourse.\nThe Academic Staff Assembly is\ncurrently draught inga questionnaire to gauge the opinions of the\nacademic staff on the SCR problem.\nICU To Defend ULU\nImperial College Union is to\nsupport the UL U day of action on\nJanuary 27th. A motion in support\nof the day of action was proposed by\nMark Harman, ICCND Chair, and\nunanimously accepted.\nSpeaking at the UG M,UL U Vice\nPresident (Services) Linda O 'Leary\nsaid that the University Grants\nCommittee wrote to the University\nof London last May to inform them\nof the proposed cuts. The cuts will\naffect the Central University\nfacilities, of which Ms Leary singled\nout ULU and the library as some of\nthe most important services that\nwould be cut, although the\nallocation of the cuts has not yet\nbeen made clear by Senate House\nAlthough ICU has many\nfacilities, those at ULU are also used\nby many IC students. Ms O 'Leary\noutlined the UL U campaign, noting\nthat 15% of IC students had signed\nthe petition against the cuts, and\ntold those present about the\npostcard campaign that is being\nmounted against against the UGC.\nA motion has been passed through\nSenate, objecting to the cuts, and the\nday of action is being held the day\nbefore the matter is raised at court.\nICU President Christine Taig,\nreported that the College Unions\nwould support the students' action\nand it was agreed that the Exec\nshould investigate ways of\nprotesting.\nICU Hon Sec Dave Colley: Grief stricken at not being mentioned on the\nfront page \u2022\nSouth Africa\nTalk\nA representative from the South\nAfrican Embassy will present a talk\nentitled \"South Africa The Future\"\nfor the Conservative Society on\nTuesday.

It may well be that the\nmajority of students would prefer to\nsee the QT snack bar continue\nproviding fast food in the JCR, rather\nthan a better deal for ICU from the\nSherfield organisation. A survey and\nnext week's EGM will decide. Iknow\nthat the Exec must find it\ndiscouraging to have their arguments\nrejected at College Committees, but\nat the same time it is responsibly to\nensure that they report fully to the\nstudent body.

It is easy for\nstudents to be almost oblivious of\nwhat even a diligent Exec are doing.\nDream Ticket\nThis week, as last, FELIX has printed\na selection of letters concerning the\nICU Council story which we ran in\nthe Christmas issue. As far as it is\npossible we try to ensure that the news\ncoverage is unbiased and objective;\nthere are those who say this makes\nFELIX rather dull, and that it is, after\nall, only a student rag. Need we\ntherefore be so contentious when\nwriting news? I am pleased that so\nmany correspondents argue that the\nnews should be fair and accurate, but\nthe flood of letters has been\nsomething of an over-reaction. It is\nonly possible to report events as you\nsee them, and peoples' impressions\nwill also vary, particularly in\nemotional situations. Too much of\nwhat we have received has been\npenned by people who write before\nthey think, and has only been included\nbecause I welcome criticism of\nFELIX. I am not going to allow\nanother marathon exchange of\nletters, however, or let the paper be\nused as a publicity vehicle for\nsabbatical candidates, real or\nimaginary. No further correspondence on this subject will be\nprinted.\nFELIX\nThere will be a staff meeting today at\n12.30pm. All welcome.\nThe office will be closed for most of\nMonday and Tuesday of next week,\nwhilst we receive training on the new\ntypesetter. Please' deliver all articles\nand classified entries between\n12.30pm and 1.30pm. I will not be\navailable at other times.\nTory Wet During Big Freeze\nMr Jim Prior MP addressed a group\nof about 100 students on the\n\"Economic facts of life\" on Tuesday\nof this week. Mr Prior, who is at the\nend of a political career which\nincludes Secretary of State for\nEmployment and Minister for\nNorthern Ireland in the Thatcher\nand Heath governments, made a speech most notable for not toeing\nthe party line. He criticised both\nmajor political parties, and the\ncurrent system of government based\non confrontation, adding that\nBritain's problems could not be\nsolved by the policies of either the\nleft or the right.\nMr Prior is currently trying to\nimprove the British manufacturing\nindustry, both in his role as\nChairman of the GEC and as a member of parliament. He said that\nBritain must accept changes in the\nrunning of Parliament, in order to\nseek a greater degree of agreement\nbetween political parties, and thus\navoiding the damaging changes\ncaused by changing governments.\nCredits\nThanks to Jim Clayden, Chris\nEdwards, Bill Goodwin, Chris\nMartin, Nigel Whitfield, Judith\nHackney, Pippa Salmon, Dave\nBurns, Dave Williams, Chas Jackson,\nAdrian Johnson, Mark Cottle, Aaron\nKotcheff Liz Holford, Douglas\nEarle, Hugh Southey, Dave Parry,\nseveral people from RCSU, Steve\nShackell.

The event was\norganised by the Conservative\nSociety.\nThe Greatest\nScoop Ever\nAsbestos was removed from the\nComputing Department and shed\nnear the old Chemistry building\nover the Christmas holidays. Mr\nDavid Price, of the College Safety\nSection, described the removal as\n\"normal\". There is a large amount\nof asbestos even in the more modern\nCollege buildings, although no\nmore has been added since the EEC\ndirective made imports illegal. The\nasbestos is removed only when it\nbecomes a health hazard, since to\nremove it all at once would cost the\nequivalent of a whole department's funding, he explained.\nThe Health and Safety Executive\nand the Factories Inspectorate are\nnotified in regard to all asbestos\nremoval and about one in four jobs\nare inspected. Removing asbestos is\na very time consuming and detailed\noperation, said Mr Price, describing\nthe procedure which involves\nsealing the area in a plastic sheeting\ntent and lowering the pressure inside\nthe tent to ensure no asbestos fibres\nescape. There are no asbestos\nremovals being carried out at\npresent.\nU1U travel\nWherever you want to go...\n\u2022 Worldwide flights.\n\u2022 Special fares\n'or students\nand academics.\n\u2022 Tours and\nshort breaks\n\u2022 Ski holidays.\n\u2022 European trains.\n...we'll get you there!\nEnquiries and Bookings \u2014~ E3\nEuropean 01-581 8 2 3 3 '\nIntercontinental 01-581 1022\nUnbeatable prices \u2014 unbeatable quality!\nCall in and see how far you can go.\nULU Travel\nImperial College\nSherfield Building\nA service of\nSTJti\nTheWoridbeaters\n\n"

    "content": "Featura FELIX, Friday January 16th19877 to be intending to do the same thing\nand that we have not overcome our\nproblems would appear to give the\nlie to this.\nMeanwhile earthbound sightings\nof UFO's reported to be of \"flying\nsaucers\" have largely been\nattributed to other, natural causes,\nor to human error. Recent research\nhas suggested that eyewitness\naccounts, once the backbone of the\nmodern judicial system are so\nunreliable as to be damaging. It has\nbeen shown that the things that\npeople believe they see are due to\npreconceived opinions more than to\nthe reality - even to the extent that\nthey think they have been mugged\nby a black person simply due to\nnewspaper reports that most\nmuggers are black, simply because\nthere was insufficient time to see the\nattackers property. Likewise, when\nit comes to UFO sightings, similar\npreconceived notions colour the\nevents recalled. Frequently the\ntestimonies of airline pilots and\nfighter pilots are invited as \"expert\"\nwitnesses, when in reality the reverse\nis true. Pilots are trained to\nrecognise other aircraft since their\nlives may depend on it, and accounts\nof strange objects with windows are\noften due to a combination of poor\nseeing conditions and conditioning.\nThe most famous occur en ce of\nthis was in 1973 in an episode known\nas the Coyne Incident where a helicopter pilot was chased by a UFO, which caused panic strike n pilot Lieutenant Larry Coyne to put\nthe craft into a steep dive. The UFO\nstopped overhead, bathed the crew\nin a green light and sped off to the\nwest, changing colour as it went.\nInstruments malfunctioned, the\nradio died, the craft was trapped in\n\"an anti gravity vortex\" and rose\nthousands of metres into the sky\nbefore it could be brought under\ncontrol. At first it seemed to be hard\nevidence for the flying saucer\ntheory, but closer examination\nshowed that much of the episode\nwas due to panic and instinct rather\nthan advanced alien technology.\nThe radio malfunction was found\nto be due to low altitude blocking\nout signals, the green glow simply\ndue to the green anti glare strip along\nthe top of the helicopter windshield,\nand the sudden rise due to\ninstinctive pulling back on the stick\n\u2014 an act frequently performed by\nexperienced pilots. The UFO was\nprobably an Orionid meteor.\nSightings are frequently due to\natmospheric effects as well as\nmeteor showers. Many of the\nsightings which involve lights in the\nsky performing exotic man oe vres can frequently be put down to\ninversions. This is an effect caused\nby warm air layers coming into\ncontact with cold air layers. At the\ninterface a mirror like surface forms\ndue to sudden changes in density,\ndue to the changes in refraction and\nreflection properties. The UFO's encountered are merely the\nreflections of car headlamps in the\nsky - this giving rise to sudden\ncourse changes as they go round\ncorners, a phenomena often\nreported.\nSecretAir Force report admits the threat is TeS. UFOs May Doom Life On Earth Read The Official U.S. Government Findings!\nFREE\nWHEN you O TO gR_ mm s TO KEEP RSGASDtESS\n'\u2022 Portfolio of 8\", 1\n0 o ios. ls..\nVOUaeTAUTHffi\nThe other major sightings, those\nof \"flying saucers\" can often be\nattributed to hoaxes and more\nrarely odd cloud formations. It is\npossible that the clouds may have\ninspired the saucer idea - as well as\nearly science fiction movies such as\nThe Day The Earth Stood Still and\nForbidden Planet - an idea that has\nbecome so prevalent that few other\nshapes are ever reported. It may also\nbe due to the fact that hubcaps and\nfrisbees do fly exceedingly well,\nwhereas breeze-blocks do not.\nThe case for extraterrestrials is\nnot helped by the hoaxes purported\nby even some of the most senior\nUFOlogists in their attempt to have\ntheir case taken seriously.\nIn an attempt to have the United\nNations take a look at the UFO\nstory, the tiny island republic of\nGrenada (before its invasion by\nAmerica), led by its self-styled\n\"mystic\" prime minister Sir Eric\nGairy, requested a meeting with\nSecretary General Kurt Waldheim.\nIn doing so, Gairy invited several\nprominent UFOlogists to attend,\nand was billed as being \"the most\nimportant meeting in the history of\nUFOology.\" However it was merely\na courtesy extended to any member\nstate. The overall effect was not\nhelped by the hoax organised by on\nCharlotte Blob of the UFOEC\n(UFO Education Centre) which\nrelated the story of an eminent\nMexican Physician who treated an\nalien being after a saucer landed\nnear a Mexican village. The\n\"eminent physician\" turned out to\nbe none other than Charlotte Blob's husband.\nIt has been computer enhancement that has provided the\nlast nail in the coffin of\nphotographic UFO evidence in\nmany cases. Many have been\ndiscovered to be double exposures,\nsaucers hanging by strings or simply\nout of scale pictures. The same\ntechnique has been used to discredit\nmany photos purported to be of the\nLock Ness Monster. Ironically it\nalso provided the famous picture of\na diamond shaped fin from a meaningless blob, fuelling more\ncontroversy.\nWhilst it seems that extraterrestrials have yet to arrive, the\nUFO saga has done much to show\nwhat people are prepared to believe\nin if they want to. The desire for an\nend to famine and global war makes\nan alien race saving us from\nourselves very attractive. It also\nremoved the need to make any\nconscious decisions to alleviate\nthese problems, hoping that Big\nBrother will sort us out. That in\nitself is a far more worrying fact\nthan any belief in little green men.\n\n"
