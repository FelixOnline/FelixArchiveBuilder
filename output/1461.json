We\u2019ve got shirts, flags,\nfootballs and even Pringles trying to get\na slice of World Cup fever. It\u2019ll come\nas no surprise that electronics manufacturers are also trying to get in on\nthe marketing buzz; the World Cup is\na brilliant motivator to get people into\nstores and buying nice new large screen\nHDTVs. Even the Chinese electronics\nindustry recognises the potential market the World Cup provides, which is\nwhy we\u2019ve been sent the Lanchiya mi-football for review.\nOK, I know what you\u2019re thinking:\n\u2018Lanchiya, who?\u2019 To be honest, I\u2019d\nnever heard of them before, but\na quick Google shows you they\nmake a few different iPod docks\nunder the brand Speakal. You\u2019ll\nget no prizes then for guessing that\nthat\u2019s exactly what the mi-football\nis, as the name might suggest: a powered iPod speaker dock in the shape of\na football. The mi-football or miSoccer\nas it\u2019s known in the US, fits into a range\nthat comprises of the iPig, the iPanda,\nthe iBoo (think a Pacman ghost) and\nthe iPom, all featuring similar riffs on\nthe ball shaped powered iPod speaker\ndocks.\nball, which itself is available in white\nand black or white and blue colour\nschemes. The white panels themselves\nare begging to have your favourite\nclubs crest stuck on them, be it England for the World Cup or Arsenal if\nyou\u2019re a Gunners fan.\nkeep it nice and stable on a flat surface.\nThe bottom panel on the front houses\nthe mi-football\u2019s IR receiver and LED\nindicator to keep you abreast of what\u2019s\nhappening, plus a duct for the sub, hidden in the black. Underneath there\u2019s a\nsocket for the power adapter, a 3.5mm\nsocket for auxiliary audio and a switch\nto turn off the mi-football, as well as\nthe perforated speaker grill of the sub.\nOverall, the mi-football is anything but sleek, but it is a grower. The\nlonger you look at it, the more attractive it seems, but it\u2019s certainly one for\nfootball fans, or someone looking for\nsomething cute.\nThat\u2019s the design, but what\u2019s it\nlike to use? Well the mi-football\nis a \u2018Made for iPod\u2019 device meaning that it has access to the iPod\nplay controls using the touch\nsensitive buttons and the iPod\nmenu system using the included\ncard remote. The remote has up\nand down buttons, a menu button\nand an enter button for navigating\nthrough the various iPod menus. Volume, track skip, play/pause, a mute\nbutton and a standby button are also\nincluded, along with treble and bass\nadjustment for fine-tuning the speaker\u2019s performance and an AUX button\nfor alternative audio input. Overall,\noperating the iPod or iPhone through\nthe mi-football is fine, a little frustrating using buttons on the remote\nrather than a scroll wheel or kinetic\nscrolling but as good as it\u2019s going to\nget using a remote without a screen.\nOf course, to see what\u2019s happening\non the iPod you\u2019re going to have to be\nwithin touching distance of the thing,\nwhich to my mind slightly defeats the\npoint of having menu controls on the\nremote. Another small annoyance\nabout the mi-football when it comes\nto actual functionality is that when you\nstick your iPod in the dock it instantly\nstarts playing at a default volume that\nyou can\u2019t set yourself. That\u2019s great if\nO\nnly six weeks left \u2018til the\nsummer break. Whether\nthis means you\u2019re finally\nfree of Imperial\u2019s clutches\nor just on remand, everyone\u2019s looking\nforward to a bit of sun (hopefully) and\na break. From iPod docks to phones,\nfrom cameras to tablets, tech doesn\u2019t\nstop when summer begins.\nWe\u2019ve got quite a few things to look\nforward to in the tech-o-sphere this\nsummer. First and foremost we\u2019ve got\nthe unveiling and release of a brand\nspanking new iPhone. OK, it\u2019s still\nonly rumoured, but if the stars align,\nI\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re going to find at\nWeekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed\nAnother week\u2019s done and dusted leaving only six weeks left \u2018til\nthe summer break, so let\u2019s get\ninto it, shall we?\nSony turned a few heads this\nweek with the unveiling of their\nmuch anticipated \u2018ultra-compact\u2019 DSLRs, the NEX3 and\nNEX5. The tiny camera bodies\nsporting massive DSLR lenses\nmake the current crop of Micro Four Thirds snappers look\npositively porky whilst sporting\nSony\u2019s current E-mount lenses.\nPacking a 14.2MP sensor,\n1080i\nmovie\nmode with an\narticu- lating 7.5cm LCD for\nlooking at your glorious pictorial creations, the NEX5 brings\nlots to the party. The NEX3\ndrops the video down to a still\nrespectable 720p/30fps. Available from next month, if you\u2019re\nafter a bit more DSLR in your\ncompact camera then maybe\none of these beauties will suit.\nEver fancied designing yourself a nuclear reactor but don\u2019t\nknow where to start? Got an\niPhone or iPad? Well it\u2019s your\nlucky day because just like\neverything else, there\u2019s an app\nfor that. Nuclear boffins from\nUniversity of Utah have turned\nto the Apple iDevices using\na freely available app called\nImageVis3D to display reactor\nmodels and simulations on the\ngo. Great for the commute into\nwork.\nApple\u2019s not had a great week\nthis week. First NPD announces that Google\u2019s Android has\nbumped iPhone OS from the\nnumber two smartphone spot\nunder RIM\u2019s Blackberry OS. Of\ncourse Apple wasn\u2019t having any\nof it and hit back with an IDC\nreport that said, worldwide,\nthe iPhone dominates 16.1%\nof the smartphone market \u2018far\noutselling Android\u2019\n. Regardless\nof where you look however, it\u2019s\nclear that Android is indeed\ngaining traction in the smartphone space, something that\nwasn\u2019t always guaranteed.\nApple also took a blow from\nanother next-gen iPhone prototype going missing and turning\nup in the hands of the Vietnamese. Slight differences were noticeable between this one and\nthe Gizmodo-acquired one,\nnamely the two screws from\nthe bottom of the device were\nnow hidden. A teardown\nof the device also\nshowed the prototype\nto be packing an Apple A4 chip, the same\none that powers the\nblisteringly fast iPad.\nGood news for all\nthose iPhone 3G users hanging\non \u2018til June/July.\nIf you\u2019re sick of your laptop and you can\u2019t stand the\nthought of a tablet, good news!\nThe Asus EeeKeyboard is now\navailable for pre-order!

All you need is a ball, some\nposts and a pitch. But this year, players\nsuch as Messi and Defoe will be sporting the lightest boots ever, made from\na single layer of polyurethane. No padding means they\u2019re faster turning and\nlighter. Just don\u2019t get stamped on eh?\nyou want an instant loud blast of mu-sic, but if you\u2019re looking for something\na little quieter or just want to charge\nyour iPod or iPhone, it\u2019s extremely an-noying. To make matters worse when\nyou do want to turn it down quickly,\nthe touch sensitive buttons that ring\nthe front of the iPod slot aren\u2019t all that\nresponsive. In fact if you don\u2019t put\nenough of your finger on the button it\ndoesn\u2019t register the input at all, leading\nto frustrated stabbing at buttons whilst\ntrying to shut the thing up. It\u2019s a shame\nLanchiya didn\u2019t make a better job of\nhoning the button sensitivity or just\nused physical buttons, but making sure\nyou use your thumb or a large finger\ntouch gets the job done in the end.\nfor the best part of \u00a350 (\u00a349.99 best\nprice at the time of print), it\u2019s not bad\nat all. For the price, it\u2019s got punchy,\nif not deep bass, relatively well defined highs with a decent mid-range.\nThese speaker docks are often measured by their \u2018room filling sound\u2019, and\nthe mi-football certainly has enough\npower and volume to fill a room. Its\nsub moves an impressive amount of\nair through its channelled duct at the\nfront, which can be felt blasting out in\noperation and it shows in the loudness\nthat the little ball is capable of. Even at\nhigh amplitude, the speakers in the mi-football do an admirable job with little\nto no distortion. There are a few caveats however, mainly that the bass and\ntreble adjustments that Lanchiya has\ngiven you on the remote do very little,\nand the stereo separation of the small\nclosely packed speakers is pretty poor,\nbut considering it\u2019s size and compact\nframe it\u2019s not much to quibble about.\nCan you get better sounding iPod\ndocks? Yes of course, but the mi-foot-ball holds it\u2019s own in the budget price\nrange and at \u00a350 it might be just the\nbit of football tech you need to see you\nthrough the World Cup.\nOn first impressions, it\u2019s not immediately apparent what the mi-football\u2019s\nfunction is. It has a slot in the top that\ntakes the universal dock adapters for\nyour iPod, a few logos for the touch-sensitive control buttons on the top\nand comes with a little card remote;\nbut the actual speakers and sub are\nhidden inside the ball.

    "content": "10 felix FRIDAY 14 MAY 2010\nBUSINESS\nBusiness Editor\nBusiness Editor Sina Ataherian\nSina Ataherian\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNew government promises urgent cuts\nAs the new Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government promises urgent spending cuts to reduce the\ndeficit, Sina Ataherian reviews how the political events of the week may affect the British economy\nL\nast Wednesday, the first of\nthe government\u2019s cabinet\npositions began to be re-vealed. The Liberal Democrats secured five cabinet\nposts and twenty ministerial jobs in\nreturn for their participation in the\ncoalition. The top two economic roles\n- Chancellor of the Exchequer and\nBusiness Secretary - have been split\nbetween the two coalition partners.\nGeorge Osborne will follow on from\nhis role as Shadow Chancellor by becoming the new Chancellor.\nHaving worked in the Conservative\nParty for his entire career, Osborne became MP for Tatton in 2001. He was\npromoted to the Shadow Cabinet by\nMichael Howard in 2004, and made\nShadow Chancellor in May 2005, at the\nage of 34. Mr Osborne is a close friend\nand advisor to David Cameron, and the\ntwo have been compared with Blair/\nBrown for sharing important roles in\ntransforming a major party.\nFollowing the collapse of Northern\nRock and the start of the financial cri-sis, Mr Osborne was instrumental in\nthe Tories being the only major British party to criticise the government\u2019s\ninterventionist policies such as bailing\nout the banks and printing significantly more money. However, he backed\ndown from these positions after free-market solutions to the economic\nproblems of 2008 and 2009 came to\nbe seen as unpopular with the British\nelectorate.\nAlthough he was prominent in planning the Tory election campaign and in\nwriting their manifesto, Mr Osborne\nwas largely kept away from the public\nin the weeks preceding the elections\nbecause of the perception of him being too much of a lightweight for the\noffice of the Exchequer. As Chancellor,\nMr Osborne will retain responsibility for overseeing banks and financial\nregulation.\nThe next most important economic\njob has gone to the Liberal Democrat\u2019s\nTreasury spokesman. Vince Cable entered parliament in 1997 after a career\nin economics, having worked for the\nKenyan government, the Commonwealth Secretary-General, and Royal\nDutch Shell.\nHe ran unsuccessfully for parliament\nthree times in the 1980s and early\n1990s as a Candidate on the leftist\nwing of the SDP, and later the Liberal\nDemocrats following the merger of the\ntwo parties.\nHowever, in recent years he has been\nconsidered to be on the right of the\nLiberal Democrats, having influenced\ntheir \u201cOrange Book\u201d, a pamphlet advocating slightly more economically liberal policies for the Liberal Democrats.\nHe gained respect for having warned\nagainst the problems that could have\narisen from the housing bubble and\nexcessive consumer debt, but was\ncriticised for his inconsistency in the\ndebates on solutions to the financial\ncrisis. For example, he embraced the\ngovernment\u2019s quantitative easing program after criticising it and claiming\nthat it was inspired by the \u201cRobert\nMugabe school of economics.\u201d\nDespite personal disputes in the\npast - over both economic policy and\ncertain allegations against George Osborne, over which Mr Cable filed a\nformal complaint - the two will now\nhave to work closely with Mr Cable in\norder to deliver both party\u2019s optimistic\nelection promises on the economy. Although the Bank of England has been\nseeing the green shoots for several\nmonth now, unemployment continues\nto rise.\nNew coalition Cabinet positions announced\nTop: David Cameron and Nick Clegg have agreed to form the first Conservative-Liberal coalition in parliamentary history\nBelow: Osborne (right) will chair a new parliamentary committee on financial regulation, which will include Cable (left)\n\u00a36 billion of emergency cuts\nThe Conservatives have announced\nthat the new Chancellor George Osborne will prepare an emergency\nbudget within the next fifty days that\nwill include \u00a36 billion of emergency\ncuts, in a bid to reduce the deficit and\nincrease confidence in the market for\nBritish government bonds.\nThe cuts have been announced as\npart of the power-sharing deal with\nthe Liberal Democrats. This will also\ninclude a new tax on banks, a parliamentary commission to decide on\nwhether to force banks to divorce their\nretail and investment operations, caps\non bonuses as well as plans to increase\nbusiness lending.\nThe deal also accommodates a Liberal Democrat election promise to raise\nthe earnings threshold at which people\nstart paying income tax from \u00a36,475 to\n\u00a310,000 pounds a year, although this\nwill be phased-in and not implemented immediately, as promised.\nThe proposals will be funded by increasing national insurance tax by one\nper cent, increasing capital gains tax\nfrom eighteen to forty per cent, and\nscrapping the Tories\u2019 proposal to raise\nthe inheritance tax threshold to \u00a31\nmillion.\nKing welcomes new agreements\nBank of England Governor Mervyn\nKing welcomed the new ConservativeLiberal Democrat agreement to cut the\ndeficit, saying, \u201cthe agreement I have\nbeen informed about that was reached\nbetween Conservatives and Liberal\nDemocrats is a very strong and powerful agreement.\u201d\nKing also noted that while the economic recovery may \u201cgather strength,\u201d\nrisks \u201chave increased somewhat, reflecting in particular heightened\nmarket concerns about the prospects\nfor fiscal consolidation in a range of\ncountries.\u201d\nThe comments came after the Governor released new quarterly figures\non the economy. He predicted that the\neconomy will improve, achieving 3.5\npercent annual growth by the beginning of 2012. He also predicted that\ninflation will remain below the central\nbank\u2019s 2 per cent target.\nThe forecasts have not changed\nmuch since the last quarterly results\nwere released in February, and are\nbased on the interest rate staying close\nto its record low of 0.5 percent this\nyear and reaching 1.7 percent by the\nend of 2011.\nFTSE reacts to coalition deal\nLast Wednesday the FTSE fluctuated\nsignificantly as news of a new Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition\ncoincided with fears about the Greek\ndebt situation and its potential impact\non the financial markets.\n\u201cWith the European problems likely\nput on the back-burner for now we\nshould start to get a clearer picture of\nhow the U.K. plans to tackle what is\nexpected to be one of the largest de-veloped-market deficits in 2010,\u201d Jim\nReid, a strategist at Deutsche Bank,\nwrote in an e-mail to clients today.\nThe FTSE has fallen 8.6 percent\nfrom this year\u2019s peak amid concern\nthat Greece\u2019s debt crisis will spread. It\nsurged 5.2 percent on May 10 after the\nEuropean Union agreed to offer financial assistance worth 750 billion euros.\nNew coalition government\u2019s economic priorities and reactions from the BoE and the FTSE\nBoE Governor Mervyn King\n\n"

The permanent\nDJ booth behind the stage is described\nas the \u201ccenterpiece of Metric, complete with an LED acrylic wall which\ncan change colour and design\u201d.\nThe scheme also gives more information about how Metric will be used,\nincluding a proposed low-ceilinged\narea with comfortable booth seating away from the dancefloor. It\u2019ll be\nopen seven days a week and although\nnot pictured, the plan is apparently\nfor removable furniture to convert the\nvenue for daytime use as well.\nThe bar which will replace daVinci\u2019s\nis also shown with exposed brick-work behind the counter. The rest of\nit is much more upmarket than daVinci\u2019s currently; plans show a polished wooden floor, concrete below\nand above the bar itself and baby-blue painted walls. Gone are the TV\nscreens and instead there are plans to\nproject sports and other programmes\nstraight onto the wall.\nThe Phase 3 team are calling for everyone with an opinion to comment\nonline, and are stressing that there is\nstill scope for alterations to the plans.\nfelix went out to find out what the\nopinion was amongst students around\nImperial. Reactions were reasonably\npositive although with typical pessimistic style, one fresher described the\nBar plans as \u201cway TOO nice\u201d and another commented \u201cit looks classy, but\nit also looks like a place where you\u2019d\nget kicked out of if you were wankered\u201d. The plans were also described as\nmisrepresentative because \u201cit looks a\nlot bigger in the pictures than it is\u201d and\nas \u201cnot stunning but they\u2019re a step in\nthe right direction.\u201d One Union punter\nsaid ambiguously \u201cif this bar was in\nHammersmith I wouldn\u2019t go in.\u201d Comments online are mostly very support-ive, and most people like the colours\nand modern design, although a few\npeople were in favour of brighter colour scheme. One person we spoke to\nsaid \u201cit needs to be a lot more fun and\nArtists\u2019 impressions of the unnamed bar (currently da Vinci\u2019s), left, and the new nightclub Metric, left. Students are wary of the overly \u201cclassy\u201d look the Union have gone for.\ncolourful and have a bit more artwork\u201d\nand an online commentator described\nthe plans as looking like \u201coversized\nbachelor pads\u201d.\nThe biggest bone of contention\namongst everyone surveyed, both on\nand offline was the furniture. Phase 3\nwere quick to point out that the furniture in the bar \u201cis only an indication\u201d,\nand would be discussed in a meeting\nthat took place yesterday. The chairs\nwere widely criticized for their unsus-tainably light colour and fragility and\nwere derided for not providing a convivial enough atmosphere. Most people complained that benches would be\nbetter to provide enough comfortable\nseating, although phase 3 said that\nbenches were not consistent with the\natmosphere they wanted to create.\nMetric\u2019s plans were even more highly praised as \u201cdefinitely \u2026 an alternative to other clubs in London as a night\nout\u201d, \u201cFabric-esque\u201d and \u201cjust the right\nmix of student and chic\u201d. Generally\nthe \u2018industrial\u2019 atmosphere was commended although doubts have been\nraised over acoustics in such a space\nand how nice it would be during the\nday. Phase 3 responded that they were\nconsulting with \u2018professional sound\ncompanies\u2019 and that lighting would be\nkey to the day/night transformation.\nThey will also be working on measures\nto prevent the club getting too cold to\ndrink in during the day. Many concerns were also voiced about the dangers of the concrete floor when wet for\ndrunk people slipping over, but phase\n3 were quick to reassure students that\nit would be perfectly safe.\nThere are a few comparisons of\nEastside bar with the new venue, both\npositive and negative, with some people thinking the plans look too much\nlike the existing bar-restaurant and\nothers describing them as a good alternative to it.\nDo you agree?

The first of which\nwas Loughborough University\u2019s Dance\nCompetition. The day began with one\nof the hardest challenges of all \u2013 assembling 21 sleepy dancers outside\nthe union at 5am but after a couple\nof jump-out-of-bed phone calls, two\ndancer-filled union minibuses headed\nup the M1 to Loughborough.\nThe first piece by the company\n(choreographed by Valentina Caorsi)\nwas in the Advanced Contemporary\ncategory. A hard-hitting, technically\nstrong piece with contemporary dance\nin its purest form lost out in a category\nwhich offered a diverse range of interpretations of \u201ccontemporary dance\u201d.\nThe Beginners Ballet (choreo-graphed by Soraia Pimenta and Pernelle Nunez) took to the stage next with\na classical piece executed to perfec-tion. Their performance earned them\na thoroughly deserved 2nd Place. This\nwas followed by the Advanced Ballet\npiece (choreographed by Soraia Pimenta and Pernelle Nunez) which had\nhigh expectations due to the strength\nof the advanced ballet team this year. A\ntango-inspired, energy fuelled routine\nshowcased the abilities of the dancers\nwho walked away with a well deserved\n1st Place. To add the cherry on top, the\npiece also won for Best Choreography\nout of all the pieces in the competition.\nThe final piece at Loughborough\nwas a cheeky, super-speed Advanced\nJazz routine (choreographed by Elisa\nBellomo) that faced stiff competition\nagainst 17 other universities in a category that always delivers pieces of a\nhigh calibre.\nAfter success at Loughborough, the\nclub was highly excited for a dance-filled weekend away in Edinburgh.\nThis time the club\u2019s tap dancers led\nby choreographer Georgina Stroud\nalso attended Edinburgh University\u2019s\nDance-Off along with the four other\npieces.\nThe Beginners Tap piece was a pol-ished, energetic routine which won 3rd\nPlace in its category controversially\nlosing out to some not-so-beginner\ntappers from Sunderland. The controversy continued in the tap category\nwith the stylish, Fosse-inspired routine\nby the Advanced Tap dancers coming\n2nd, losing out to an a capella piece by\nNewcastle making it the second year\nrunning an a capella piece has won.\nThis time the Contemporary piece\nfared better with the judges awarding\n2nd Place while the Advanced Ballet\npiece was again placed 1st in its cat-egory. The Beginners Ballet piece was\nplaced 2nd losing out to a piece by\nSunderland University which included\nintermediate and advanced dancers.\nAll controversy aside, some excellent results for the club and these were\ntopped off with an individual Best\nDancer award for one of the club\u2019s\nfreshers, Francesca Boughey who\ndanced in the Advanced Ballet, Contemporary and Jazz pieces.\nAfter the results were announced,\nover a hundred hungry dancers chaotically attempted to get their hands\non the after party buffet. Following\nthe feeding frenzy the IC dancers retreated to a booth where the drinking\ngames began and elegant, once- composed dancers were transformed into\nbunnies and farm animals that had to\nknow their four-times-tables. A fabulous competition season ended with\na cocktail, tequila and champagne\nfuelled night of more dancing!\nRelease your arty side in Phoenix\nT\nhere are quite a few perks\nof being at an institute at\nImperial. Yes, this is a top-ten internationally ranked\ninstitution. Yes, that is a\nLamborghini garage down the road\nand yes, those women walking up and\ndown Cromwell Road are wearing the\nequivalent of a small fortune. However,\nwith every upside comes a downside\nand though it\u2019s not exactly cataclysmic\nin comparison to the relative benefits\noffered, there is a downside to being\nat a college so single-minded in its\npursuit of scientific and technological\nnirvana.\nAnd if you\u2019re the artsy type or to any\ndegree that way inclined, you\u2019re sure\nto feel it. Not in a tortuous and quite\nunnecessarily gratuitous fashion such\nas, say, something you would see in the\nSaw series or even any film containing\nJason Schwartzman. The relative quiet\nof the college\u2019s arts scene and lack of\ndiversity in the general student populace is understandable given its focus\non science, but those of you who loved\nyour arts subjects at school may find\nthat part of yourselves undernourished as time passes. A reality is that\nmost people will be wonderful but are\nnot going to feel as passionately as you\nabout art house cinema, interesting\nnew music scenes sprouting up around\nthe capital or that an international\nliterary legend is coming to town to\ngive a reading. For some, this will be\na largely ignored itch that occasionally needs scratching. Others will resign themselves to turning to external\nsources to find their fix.\nThis is where Phoenix comes in.\nOriginally founded in 1904 as the college\u2019s arts magazine by H.G.Wells - yes,\nthe guy who penned War of the Worlds\nand The Time Machine - its presence\nhas fluctuated until a couple of years\nago when a couple of overambitious\nCardiovascular Science undergrads\nhad a conversation on a bus down the\nShepherds Bush Road and decided it\nwould be a great idea to resurrect it.\nThe basic idea is to take the creative\nwork of the student body - that means\nyou, arty types - and to pick the best for\ninclusion in a sumptuously designed\nextravaganza of literature and art published next month. Anything will be\nconsidered - collages, drawings and\npaintings (even your A-Level work),\nphotography, poetry and short sto-ries, flash-fiction, screenplays, haiku,\noriginal designs or ideas for articles on\nsomething you particularly feel passionate about.\nWrite when the inspiration takes\nyou - in the middle of the night, in the\nshower, on the bus or under starlight.\nGet in touch with us for potential ideas\nfor sections, editorials or design. We\nare always looking for new contributors and potential editors and chances\nare, if you pitch it to us and you\u2019ve\nthought about it, we\u2019ll probably consider it.\nSpeaking of which, now that there is\nmore than one editor, Phoenix should\nbe a very special thing indeed.\nWhereas before, it would be mostly\none person putting in 32 hours over\nthe last two days running to print\ndeadline whilst simultaneously being\nshafted by the latter stages of Undergrad Medicine, now with three highly\npassionate, intelligent and talented co-editors on board, Phoenix should be a\nwork of art in itself come the end of the\nyear. So get your creative juices flowing and send us over your ideas and\nsubmissions - we can\u2019t wait to see what\nyou come up with.

Whether you\nlove them or loathe them,\nthere\u2019s no doubt that the\nlikes of Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Cheryl\nCole [Ed note: Cheryl Cole?] and co.\nare taking over.\nRiRi has come a long way since she\nfirst exploded onto the scene with Pon\nde Replay in 2005. Only 17 at the time,\nthe song showcased none of her powerful vocal skills, the video was horrendously lacking in style and fashion,\nand, most importantly, you didn\u2019t get a\nsense of who Rihanna is. Make no mistake \u2013 this girl is not your typical pop\nprincess, she\u2019s wild, she\u2019s dark, she\u2019s\nrebellious, and she does whatever the\nhell she wants to and doesn\u2019t give a toss\nabout what you think about it.\nIt may come as a surprise to those\nwho have seen her live performances on YouTube, but not only can Rihanna sing in tune, her voice is also\ncompelling and powerful. Starting\nher set with the haunting Russian\nRoulette, the song showcased not\nonly her vocal talents, but her love\nof fashion too, with a black dress\ncovered in red flashing LED lights.\nThe set was comprised of all the\nbig hits from her last two albums,\nas well as some of the lesser-known\nsongs from her latest.\nMemorable moments included\nher performance of \u2018Hard\u2019 on top\nof a neon pink army tank, the mini-rave she and her dancers had inside\nRihanna\nO2 Arena\n11th May\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\na neon cube for \u2018Please Don\u2019t Stop\nthe Music\u2019, and the emotional ballads \u2018Take a Bow\u2019 and \u2018Rehab\u2019 where\none look at her face clearly showed\nexactly who she was singing these\nsongs about.\nHer costume changes ranged from\nLady Gaga-esque leotards to big\nstatement shoulders, asymmetrical\nbody suits to gem studded FMBs,\nand her on-stage dancing and general behavior was at all times enthralling \u2013 she was clearly having\nfun and the crowd was having fun\nwith her.

Asks Kawai Wong\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk FASHION\nI\n\u2019m sorry that David\nCameron is the new\nPrime Minister.\nI\u2019m even sorrier\nthat Nick Clegg\nhas taken\nthe arbitrary title of\n\u2018Deputy Prime Minister\u2019. Not that there\u2019s\nanything political\nabout felix fashion.\nBut what with the\nobsession with the\npolitical wives, we\ncan only brace\nourselves for some\nmonths of over-cov-erage regarding maternity wear and worse \u2013 a\nyear of baby clothes.\nSuch was the frenzy\nat the newspapers and\nfashion magazines: my\ncolleague at the Telegraph spent a good 5\nhours, post-election day,\nphoning all the press\ncontacts out there, frantically in search of the red\npatchwork dress that Miriam Clegg \u2013\nor Miriam Gonzalez Durantez as she\nprefers to be known - wore on election day. Well done on Melanie\u2019s part,\nwe now know that the dress is from\na Chiswick eco-boutique, from a label called From Somewhere and costs\n\u00a3225. And now\u2026?\nI curse the day when Michelle\nObama became a style crush. Because\nof her, Britain suddenly feels the compelling need to propel our leader\u2019s\nwife into fashion stardom too. But we\nwon\u2019t settle for just one icon. We need\nthree.\nFed up with the constant pestering\nfrom the national press, Sarah Brown\nnow prepares a sheet detailing each\nand every piece of her clothing items,\nready to be sent at the expense of a\nmedia phone call. And once the info\narrives at any fashion desk, words are\nto be said about her gnarly toes protruding from a pair of red wedges.\nMiriam Gonzalez. She can\u2019t even be\nbothered to contain her chesty pups\non election day. Any grown woman\nshould realise the importance of a set\nof good lingerie. Any person, having\nbeen under 40 years of gravity and\nthree labours (not\ngovernments) later,\nshould realise\nthe need of un-derwired bras.\nAs for Sam\nCam, I have\na cunning\nsuspicion\nthat she\nwants to\nhelp fix\nher husband\u2019s\n\u2018broken\nBritain\u2019.\nTo do so,\nshe blends in with the\nkids-from-the-blocks by\ndonning a pair of bling\nloop earrings. If Carine\nRoitfeld cares to flick\nthrough the British newspapers, she\nmay choke on her\nmorning espresso.\nAndrew Marr\nonce complained\nabout the lack of effort demonstrated\nby the new breed\nof media people.\nI now understand\nwhy: comfortably sat\nin their air-conditioned\noffice, who is willing\nto set foot in the polluted and congested real\nworld in search of real\nstories when a potential\n\u2018story\u2019 is only a phone call\nand one PR away?\nThe million dollar question is: have we run out\nof fashion stories? Or is\nit simply that the fashion editors\nare too traumatised after the bazillion fashion shows they feel obliged\nto attend each year, that they fail to\nfathom the energy to march out of the\nsecurity gates on Fleet Street? If this\nis the case, Cathy Horyn of the New\nYork Times should probably zip her\nlips over the free Dolce and Gabbana\nfur airmailed to BryanBoy. At least\nhe is ACTIVELY working it (whether\nor not we like BryanBoy\u2019s unabashed\nseeking, \u2018how I wish it\u2019s a DSLR (cam-era) but I can\u2019t afford one, hu hu hu\u2019\nis another story).\nAlexa Chung, Olivia Palermo, Dita\nVon Teese, the Olsen Twins, Ece Sukan, Chloe Sevigny, Joan Burstein\u2026\nThey all style themselves without the\nneed of a stylist and hence should\nclassify as bona fide style crushes.\nSo why, when there are enough style\ncrushes to fill the pages for at least 10\nweeks, our national press chooses to\nfocus on the lot who purchase M&S\ncashmere cardigans?\nNot putting a halt on this sheepish\nstyle of reporting will only result in\ngrave calamity. Mothercare has the\npotential to become the new Topshop\nwith the arrival of another\nCameron. Get\nvery an-orexic,\ngirls.\nB\nefore all sorts of raffish perfume began to\ninvade the perfumery\ncounter, they were elixirs exquisitely crafted by\nperfumiers. A century\nago, they began blending the most exotic floral and wood extracts from all\nover the world - Reunion Island, Corsica and India...\nTraditionally perceived as the final element of an outfit, Guerlain\u2019s\nMitsouko or Chanel No.5 are worn\nand not gaudily sprayed. To piece\ntogether a Balenciaga cocktail dress\nand a set of Bvlgari jewelry, a perfume has to be worn to capture the\nmissing je ne sais quoi. Chanel\u2019s par-fumeur Jacques Polge hits the nail\non the head: \u2018The aesthetic is lacking\nsomething important when there\u2019s\nno perfume.\u2019\nSince day one, a perfume has been\nserving more purposes than a mere\nintangible accessory. You\u2019re also buying a dream that perfume makers\nsell. The latest Chanel No. 5 short\nfilm, featuring Audrey Tatou is one\nof these glamourous dreams. Audrey\nsleeps on the Oriental Express, the\nperfume bottle catches the light of\ndawn and casts a scintillating shadow in her wood-panel cabin. When\nshe meets a handsome young man, the\nscent that emanates\nfrom her is what captured his curios-ity. \u2018When a woman\ndisappears, what\nthat is left of her\nis her smell\u2019, such\nis Jacques Polge\u2019s\naphorism.\nUnfold the pages\nof a fashion magazine, how many\nspokeswomen gaze back at you seductively in skimpy clothing? How many\ntouch their lips with their mouths\nopen? How many are accompanied by\na sexy young man? Are they youthful\nor are they successful career women?\nMore so than ever, we are also buying a lifestyle indicator. The arbitrary\nsymbolism of perfume aside, how do\nyou tell apart a woman who wears Jo\nMalone or Jordan?\nUnfortunately, much to the dismay of the perfumiers that created\nthe scents, blindfold an amateur aficionado and most won\u2019t be able to\npinpoint the exact brand somebody\nis wearing. It proves the point that\nperfumes are so much more than the\nbrand sticker or the price tag. Expensive as Victoria\u2019s Secret scent may be,\nFebreze probably does a better job at\nfreshening.\nIt is palpable that we need to look\nbeyond the veil that a pale and erotic\nSophie Dahl casts on a branded fra-grance. We know that it is a mammoth task to sequester a scrupulous\nscent from the squallion offerings on\nthe perfumery counter. The compiled\nlist here is the least effort felix can do\nto guide you through the search.\nKeep an open mind when it comes\nto choosing a perfume.

Think\nof a breezy meadow when\nthe fog is just about disperse.\nWhile other perfume smells\nof fresh blossom, think of\nthis as a the whip of fresh air above a\ngrassy/earthy pitch. Affordable, 30ml\nis available at \u00a313.98 from fragranceX.\ncom. Wear with a cropped t-shirt and\ncargo pants.\nAcqua de Gioia by Giorgio\nArmani is a feminine\nfragrance crafted by\nL\u2019Oreal\u2019s Luxury Products\nDivision. It smells of a\nstill shallow sea that is\nnot too far away from\nthe shore. This scent is\ninspired by rainwater as\nwell as terrestrial elements. The heart\nof the fragrance is water jasmine,\nmint and italian lemon. Wear with one\npiece beige lace dresses. Hits stores\nin June.\nParis by Balenciaga wears like\na French woman. It has the\nsophistry of magnetism in the\nform of a musky base, and a\nbaby like soft-core powdery\nscent that is ever presence\nthroughout the lifespan of\napplication. Very demure,\nthis is the type of fragrance\nthat sinks into the background and\nyou forget about having worn any.\nBas de Soie is a new eau de\nparfum by Serge Lutens.\nThink a wild meadow filled\nwith blossoms by a running\nstream. A squirt of the clear\nliquid delivers an elegant whiff\nof hyacinth, iris and grass\nflowers.\nSpecial No. 127 by Floris smells\nlike the bass tone in an opera, the\ncologne\u2019s base note is\na masculine blend of\nmusk and patchouli.\nThe manly notes\nare balanced by the\nmellow rose and\nlavender.\nDream is a member\nof the Incanto\nseries by Salvatore\nFerragamo. The\njaunty creation is like a child licking\na lollipop in an amusement park.\nSmells colourful and sweet, it also\nreminds me of freshly washed hair.\nThe perfume has amazing staying\npower, it smells consistently lovely\nand sweet throughout the day.\nBuy online for around \u00a325/100mL\nWhite Tie and Tiara by Jo\nMalone. This limited edition\nfragrance will be available\nin June. Each purchase will\nsupport Jo Malone\u2019s pledge\nof \u00a3150,000 to the Elton John\nAIDS Foundation.

It\u2019s too short for our high sta-tus, and should be put on top of Blackett, preferably with the\naforementioned editor, haha. I say the campaign starts here.\nWho\u2019s with me?!\nYours in fellowship,\nMagnus Winklefilch (Aero)\nCatnip: We happen to think that Editor is a towering giant\nof a man. No, really, he is! Remember, keep sending stuff\nin and see your name in ink!\nA small issue with the\nQueen\u2019s Tower\nShowdown! FOIL vs. LOIL Do we \u201cLove Our Imperial Lives\u201d or do they fail hard? You decide!\nHaving active competitions in Robot Unicorn Attack when I originally planned on revising \u2013 and I\u2019m not even good at it! Verdict: FOIL\nRunning naked in Prince\u2019s Gardens at 4 am. Verdict: LOIL\nIf you google exam stress , Imperial College will be at the top of the list! haha, hilarious. Verdict: FOIL\nThis\u2019ll be the only time in my life I can afford to live in SW7. Verdict: LOIL\n\u201cWorking\u201d around midnight in the Library, surrounded by chinese people playing WOW and talking chinese. Joy. Verdict: FOIL\nThere were two girls getting off with each other at the Union. Verdict: Undecided...LOIL?\nRiding on the Fire Engine to Sainsburys when you can\u2019t be arsed to walk! Verdict: LOIL\nIt was a tight race but LOIL just clinched it this week.\nWhat do you think? Is Imperial an academic haven or a socially-inept hell? Both?! Let the Cat know!\n\n"

I\u2019m gona\nfill the hot tub with coke as well :D\nThe Nation\u2019s favourite Children\u2019s story. It\u2019s got a snake with hair\nThis is FAS bird. His mum was a\ndrunken meth addict who died giving birth to his deformed head. What\na hilarious, yet touching back story.\nThis is Fat Snake. He\u2019s a snake, but he\u2019s\nreally fat! He wants to be a metal rock\ngod, but can\u2019t play guitar because he\ndoesn\u2019t have any hands. Silly Fat Snake\nThis week FAS bird is trying to revise\nfor his quantum physics exam, but he\nhas an under-developed brain so he\u2019s\nreally stupid. HAHAHAHAHAHAH.\n\u2018HAHAHAAHAHA. You\u2019re so stupid FAS bird\u2019,\nlaughed Fat Snake, despite being stupidly fat.\nHOW TO LOSE FRIENDS, BUT WIN AN ARGUMENT\nThis made FAS bird sad, so one fine dreary evening he threw himself\noff a bridge. Fat Snake never made it as a metal rock god. The End.\nW\ne have had to endure our fair share of\nmind-numbingly dull\ndebates over the last\nfew weeks, but not just from the poli-ticians. No, as an Imperial student,\nyou are subscribed to an irrevocable\nspamming of useless information\nabout the running of our government\nfrom that smug student in the lecture\ntheatre reading the Financial Times.\nNow I like to think that I\u2019m moderately intelligent, at the very least sen-tient, but these people, wait no, these\nrobots can suddenly make me feel like\nI dropped out of primary school to follow a career in dribbling.\nThey ask you what you think of the\neconomic climate and you foolishly\nreply, \u2018I don\u2019t care\u2019. Suddenly their\neyes glow red and their automated\nresponse to political ignorance goes\ninto overdrive; \u2018You don\u2019t care!? bleep\nbleep bleep fiscal deficit bleep bleep\npublic spending...\u2019. You just sit there\nand fidget uncomfortably as you\u2019re\nbombarded to death by money words.\nSo how do you win? How do you power down that bureaucratic android?\nSTEP 1 - SHAKE YOUR HEAD in disagreement. It doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t\nunderstand what he/she/actually probably just he is saying, because he doesn\u2019t\neither. Just make sure you establish your objections. Once he sees you doing this,\nhe\u2019ll become angry and will start throwing statistics and numbers at you. Don\u2019t\nbe fazed, politicians use statistics like a fucking grenade launcher, only grenades\nare real and statistics aren\u2019t.\nSTEP 2 - Intermittently LAUGH at something he says. It doesn\u2019t matter what you\nlaugh at, but avoid phrases starting with \u2018a black man from Shropshire told me\u2019 or\n\u2018a dying cancer patient asked me\u2019\nSTEP 3 - INTERJECT. Nothing aggravates the debater more than constantly going \u2018but\u2019 at everything they say. They won\u2019t let you get further than \u2018but\u2019, which\nis great because you don\u2019t actually have anything to argue back with, you\u2019re just\ninching them closer to that inevitable aneurysm.\nSTEP 4 - KILL THEM with words and numbers. Political arguments might as\nwell just be a fight between Wikipedia and Britannica; it\u2019s just facts versus facts\nand the one with the most facts win (reliability of facts doesn\u2019t matter.) When\nyou finally get the chance to make your case, the only path to victory is nonsense.\nJust make up words like \u2018taxify\u2019 or \u2018monetarian\u2019 and then incorporate them into\nyour own made up government policies like \u2018the bush fund administration for\ncounter-parts of the civil gold alliance\u2019. Combine these with made-up statistics\nlike \u2018the National horsing tax has gone down by 0.8%\u2019 and your opponent won\u2019t\nstand a chance. The smaller the percentage, the scarier it sounds (to a politician).\n*FAS - Fetal Alcohol Syndrome :)\nThe_Cleggomatortrontown <3\nCammy just checked ur public expenses and\nu\u2019ve already spent well over two mil! Hope u\nput it towards the NHS and not ur coke bath :p\nCameron_DA_Maneron!!!\nCleggman I thought we agreed that ur in charge\nof fixin the economy and I\u2019m in charge of the\ntaxes. Don\u2019t ruin my dreams of a coke bath >:(\nH\nangman has always maintained a bitter-sweet relationship with the\nsocial networking site, Facebook, but is curious to know what you\nthink? Sure it\u2019s useful for keeping in touch with your friends you see\nand speak to every day, but what about those cringe-worthy statuses\nthat make you want to murder a kitten? And has it reached the point where any\npassing thought already has it\u2019s own facebook group along with 50,000 members?\nNow I know that many of you will be periodically checking your facebook home\npage every two minutes, so why not make something productive of your addiction and send Hangman a few screen shots. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for:\n1 - THE WORST STATUS - Send em in, (doesn\u2019t have to be a screen shot)\nbut you need to need to provide a name to check for legitimacy, although names\nwon\u2019t be printed. It needs to be a rage inducing citation, even if it\u2019s just two\nwords; they\u2019re often the worst; \u2018LUCY JONES is hoping...\u2019 What are you hoping\nfor Lucy? Why does everyone need to know that you\u2019re hoping? Your ambivalent\nstatus is either just there to annoy people or you\u2019re hoping that someone will\nactually reply and ask you to elaborate. Either way it makes you a twat! Platitudes,\nflippant remarks or just plain stupid comments- name and shame. You\u2019re failing\nexams so take it out on someone else! It\u2019s the right thing to do\n2 - THE WORST GROUP - This will be a tough competition as there are too\nmany to count. Most groups annoy me so you need to find the most infuriating waste of web space out there. Remember that small African children are\nworking twelve hour days to provide you with these Facebook groups so bring them to justice! I WISH FEELINGS HAD A OFF SWITCH!!! (That\u2019s what you\u2019re\ncontending with)\nThe winners will receive the coveted HANGMAN\nMYSTERY PRIZE! DON\u2019T MISS OUT! YOU WILL REGRET IT!

    "content": "6\nCOMMENT\nComment Editor Charlotte Morris\nComment Editor Charlotte Morris\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfelix FRIDAY 14 MAY 2010\nR\nepresentation may be the\nmost banal word used by\nthe Union. Most students\n(and staff) are barely aware\nthat a representation network in the Union exists, let alone how\nit can help them. It has the unfortunate status of being seen as too boring\nto engage with and yet, in reality, it is\ntoo important to ignore. Representing\ntheir members should be the primary\nfunction of all Unions. As much as we\nlike to get drunk in the bars, and join\nclubs, I believe the Union\u2019s most important function it is to provide a voice\nfor each student and if necessary, defend them.\nThe key to any representative system,\nlike we have in the Union where students\u2019 views can be delivered to the Union and College, and in Britain where\nour MPs and Councillors take our views\ninto account when making decisions (or\nare meant to), is accountability. Without some way to hold the elected to\naccount, there can be no way the voter\ncan make a balanced judgement on who\nwill represent them faithfully.\nUnfortunately, when people are\nelected for a year and then mostly move\non, there is little chance for a voter to\nshow their anger at the person\u2019s con-duct. Let\u2019s face it, your Departmental\nRepresentative could get the position,\nnever turn up to a single meeting, never\npass on an email about bad coursework\nmarking or poor treatment of students,\nand you can\u2019t do anything. He or she\nwill sit in the job interview with that\nlittle addition on their CV which to the\ninterviewer says team-player but to you\nand your course says failure, betrayal\nand abuse of the system. Just something\nelse that makes us think the Union is\nineffectual.\nI don\u2019t want to make out that I think\neveryonewhotakesthesepositionsdoes\nit for their CV; in most cases, people do\nraise issues to the staff and further up\nthe representation network. Problems\nalso lie with getting staff to give feed-back, and to take student representation seriously. But there is a problem.\nUp until this year there has never been\na proper Representation Policy of the\nUnion; this may seem strange, even ab-horrent, that we didn\u2019t have guidelines\non how the system should operate.\nLuckily, Jon Silver, the Deputy President of Education, has been putting it\ntogether. It is something we should be\nproud of. The body which first should\ndiscuss and pass this policy is the Representation and Welfare Board (RWB).\nAt the last meeting they took a second\nlook at the policy. Barely anyone at-tended. Yes: what should be one of the\nmost important committees passing\nwhat will be the most seminal policy for\nsome time, affecting everyone at Imperial, was seemingly ignored.\nWhy? Because there are no reper-cussions, no accountability. The only\npeople who know about the absentees\nwere at the meeting, or you if you read\nthe minutes. This means that not only\ndo we have a system where people can\nget away with not caring, but because\nof this, the positions themselves are\ndemeaned. This makes them seem less\nimportant, more of a CV-grabbing goal,\nwhere meetings to discuss the representation of some 14,000 students are a\nmere inconvenience.\nI genuinely believe there are students\nwho would be fantastic in every level of\nwhat soon will be a revamped, rejuve-nated, high profile and serious representation network, backed by policy. If\nyou have a problem, you will know exactly where to go. And your representatives will be accountable.\nI want everyone to know who has\nturned up for meetings and what is\nbeing discussed, and for it to be easily\naccessible, at all levels. This starts right\nnow. The elections for many positions\non the RWB next year are happening\nnow. Read the manifestos. Vote. And\nnext year, test us.\nAlexKendallwantsyoutotesthim.Goon.\n\u201cMost students\n(and staff) are\nbarely aware that\na representation\nnetwork in the\nUnion exists\u201d\nPhilSandwellisinlovewithouroldneigbour\n\u201cA room filled with\nmore beautiful\nbirds than you\ncould ever hope to\nsee at the Union.\u201d\nV\nery few things inspire an\ninnocent sense of wonder in me like the Natural\nHistory Museum. Despite\nmost of the visitors not\nbeing eight years old, the Diplodocus in\nthe main hall still possesses the stopping\npower to freeze people as if he had bent\ndown to introduce himself (his name\nis Dippy, if you were wondering, courtesy of Andrew Carnegie). Meanwhile\nthe Ronson Gallery, identifiable by the\nswarm of children gaggling towards it,\nis the room that widens the eyes of the\ngeneration who grew up with Jurassic\nPark. If, unlike me, you can pass through\nit without a guilty mix of awe and fear at\nhow large and pointy life was 150 million\nyears ago then I pity the maturity of your\ninner child. Even the clunky automaton\nTyrannosaurus rex should raise the hairs\non the back of a twenty-something-yearold\u2019s neck, in the same way a sense of\ninstant dread can be created by whispering \u201cclever girl\u201d into an unsuspecting ear.\nUnearthly guttural screaming and the\nsubsequent jumping onto your target are\noptional, but encouraged.\nDownthehallwayisaroomofcreatures\nthat live on well past their best-before\ndates, stuffed and preserved for eternity\nin school-photograph-style awkward-ness. Amongst the mounted kangaroos\nand bats there are, so typically of the Natural History Museum, a few specimens\nthat pass under the radar of the crowds;\ndiscovering them made me feel like I\nwas learning something completely new\nabout a very good friend. One example is\nthe fantastically-named pink fairy arma-dillo, with its especially armoured rear,\nbut looking down the corridor of glass\ncases gives a solemn impression. Gazing\ninto a leopard\u2019s lifeless eyes as they stared\nthrough me forlornly highlighted the fact\nthatthisanimaldiedtoeducateagroupof\nsnotty, gawping children. Standing inches\nfromoneofthelastremainingTasmanian\ntigers to live before its species was extinguished gave me pangs of responsibil-ity, which were only accentuated when I\ncame to the polar bear further down the\nhall. Perhaps one day they might be together in a case headed \u201cAnimals Incompatible with the Human Race\u201d\n. On the\nother hand, some of the newer exhibits\nlook like expressing their feelings at being re-emboweled through their bottoms\nwith formaldehyde and straw by tearing\nthe nearest little reprobate to ribbons. If\nonly.\nOne of my favourite places in the Museum is a room filled with more beautiful\nbirds than you could ever hope to see on\none night at the Union. The Himalayan\nmonal \u2013 a metallic green pheasant \u2013 puts\nthe native fauna to shame, as it does the\nshabby-lookingdodoreplicaseeminglyput\ntogether with a Pritt stick, some pigeons\nand a Victorian taxidermist\u2019s best wishes.\nFurther down is an entire case devoted\nto hundreds of hummingbird specimens,\nconfined to a life behind glass simply for\nbeing very small and very pretty; this display would have tugged at my heartstrings\nmore only if it also featured a stuffed Labrador puppy. These are in contrast to the\nresidents of the Large Mammals Hall, who\nqualify for admission by being relatively\nlarge mammals. Having the 10 ton skeleton of a blue whale above your head gives\nan appreciation that whales have no sense\nof retaliation: if I were their size, I would\nteach anyone who harpooned my buddies\na very swift lesson.\nThe (originally) inanimate exhibitions\nare often undeservingly overlooked.\nGiven that astronauts of Apollo 16 travelled to the Moon and back to collect it, I\nfeel that the Museum\u2019s collection of rock\nsamples deserves better than a darkened\ncorridor for a home. Likewise the Ruin\nMarble, whose pattern uncannily resembles a decaying city, should honour\na plinth and not a porthole for convincing me that nature can imitate art. For\nthe only items I have ever truly considered stealing from a Museum, however,\nhead upstairs to the Vault. My inner\nmagpie replaced my generally intelligent\nmusings with \u201cooh, shiny things\u2026\u201d as\nI gawked my way around jewels mind-shatteringly out of my price range. And\nfor fun, when I want to feel completely\ninsignificant and worthless, I look at\nthe small vial at the back of the room\nwhich is home to microscopic diamonds\nformed in the dust of a dying star.\nThe big news at the Museum last\nyear was the opening of its new Darwin Centre, an eight storey cocoon in\nwhich visitors are meant to learn about\nscientific methods. Intended to give an\ninsight into the scientific discovery process by having professional scientists on\ndisplay and ready to answer questions, I\nwas impressed by its realism: visiting on\na sunny Friday afternoon, I was met by\nunderstandably deserted desks. Although\nI appreciate that the Museum is trying to\nteachthegeneralpublicwhathappensbe-hind the scenes, and as much fun as identifying fly genitalia on futuristic, Minority\nReport-stylescreenswas,Ifeelthatthey\u2019re\nmissing the point of why people visit. I go\nthere to the Museum to wander around,\npress my nose against the glass and to be\nimpressed by what the Earth has managed to produce over the past few billion\nyears. I don\u2019t want to hear about research\npapers when I visit, I want to skim-read a\nfew sentences about where and when the\nAnkylosaurus in front of me lived and let\nmy mind\u2019s eye do the rest. The Natural\nHistoryMuseumisthesinglegreatestcollection of inspiration in London, let alone\nwithin a five-minute walk of campus; put\nyour pen down, leave your brain in the\nlibrary and come here to give your imagination a well-deserved workout.\n\n"

Unusual for the Egyptian\ngovernment was its desire to explain its decision regarding the\nextension as well as how it planned to limit their use. The government promised to use the powers solely for counterterror-ism and against drug trafficking. In addition, the government\nalso announced that it would revoke powers allowing censorship and property confiscation. Despite these limitations of\npower, many Egyptians were unhappy with the announcement\ndue to the fact that the state of emergency has been in place for\nso long, as well as continued promises from the government\nthat it would be removed.\nEgypt\nLetters to\nthe Editor\nNEWS\nDear Editor,\nIt is with great sadness, and shock, that I read\nof the passing away of Ms Sharine Brown, lately\nHead of Residences of the College. We did not\nalways see eye to eye - particularly when negotiating annual rent reviews. She was, nonethe-less, a strong champion for quality and choice\nin student accommodation and a considerable\nasset to the College. Whilst much attention\nhas been focussed on the high profile building\nprojects, Sharine quietly worked hard to ensure\nthat the best was made of the crumbling facilities whilst they awaited redevelopment. I always\nrecognised that no matter what problems arose,\nhalls at Imperial College were generally better\nrun than those at any other London university.\nShe will be a great loss to the student body and\ndeservedly missed.\nYours faithfully,\nMustafa Arif\nPresident 2003-2005, Imperial College Union\nLord Browne\u2019s\nReview on\nHigher\nEducation\nFunding &\nStudent Finance\nT\nhe latest in a string of attacks on Chinese\nschoolchildren happened Wednesday in central\nShaanxi province.\nSeven students were murdered and at least\ntwenty injured by a knife-wielding man in Nanzheng County.\nThe killer, a 48-year-old man who owned the home where the\nschool was located, killed himself directly afterwards. The attack is the sixth similar attack in China in the past eight weeks.\nAs many try to come to grips with reasons for why these attacks\ncontinue to occur, some experts are questioning the state of\nmental health care in China. Others have blamed the phenomenon on the inability of citizens to air grievances against local\nauthorities and see some of the attacks as revengeful. Parents\nat many Chinese schools have stepped up security patrols in\nresponse.\nN\north Korea claimed that it succeeded in creating a \u201cunique thermo-nuclear reaction device\u201d\nfor large-scale energy production by nuclear\nfusion.\nThe announcement by North Korean state media coincides\nwith the birthday of Kim Il-Sung, the country\u2019s founder. This\nday is known as the \u201cDay of the Sun\u201d; the country\u2019s announcement likened its fusion device to a \u201csecond sun\u201d. According to\nthe country\u2019s state media, \u201cThe successful nuclear fusion in the\nDPRK (North Korea) made a definite breakthrough towards the\ndevelopment of new energy and opened up a new phase in the\nnation\u2019s development of the latest science and technology.\u201d Experts are taking the announcement with extreme skepticism and\nbelieve that North Korea likely conducted a small experiment if\nthere is any veracity to its claims: the majority of the country\u2019s\nnuclear program is based on Soviet technology from the 1950\u2019s.\nI\nn November 2009, then Minister of Business, Innovation and\nSkills, Lord Mandelson ordered\nan independent review on higher\neducation funding and student\nfinance led by ex-BP Chief Executive,\nLord Browne of Madingley.\nAccording to Lord Mandelson, the\nreview will consider \u201cbalance of contributions to universities by taxpayers,\nstudents, graduates and employers\u201d to\nUniversity finances alongside the current and future states of university tuition\nfees.\nThe Conservative party, now in Government, are also in on the review and\nhave agreed to consider the Review\u2019s\nfindings accordingly, which are due to\nbe published this coming Autumn.\nA range of institutions, including student unions, think tanks and lobbying\ngroups have been asked to submit their\narguments on the issues being reviewed.\n*\nRising fees?\nIt has been reported that on the Review\u2019s recommendation, tuition fees\ncould rise by \u00a31,000 a year from 2013.\nThis could eventually lead to students\nbeing charged \u00a37,000 a year to attend an\naverage course at university. Most importantly for Imperial students, science\ndegrees may cost up to \u00a314,000 per year.\nUnder a free market system, universities will be able to charge the full cost of\nthe course. The Review is also likely to\nadvise to Government to scrap subsidised\nloans, and allow students to pay national\ninterest rates on money lent to them.\n\n"

Chris Morris is back\ncomic writers of all time, Chris Morris. The presence of the Morris on our\nscreens has been sadly missed since\nthe glory days of Brass Eye, the satirical show mocking sensational news\nwhich pushed the boundaries of taste\nto new heights. But Morris is back and\nhis new film is certainly not lacking\nany of the controversy that made him\na household name.\nA comedy about the pursuits of a\ngroup of home-grown Jihadists from\nSheffield plotting a terrorist attack on\nBritain sounds like the perfect recipe\nto cause offense but Four Lions cleverly\ncircumnavigates any Islamaphobia.\nThe film\u2019s protagonists are idiots, confused between the anti-Western rhetoric they gleefully spout and the joys\nof British culture they unintentionally\nenjoy. The sanest member of the group\n\u201cCake is a made up drug\u201d, Bernard\nManning famously declared with utmost sincerity on Brass Eye, \u201cOne poor\nlassie cried all the water out of her\nbody, just think how her mother feels.\nIt\u2019s a f**king disgrace\u201d. Manning was\njust one of the many celebrity causalities tricked into endorsing ridiculous\ncampaigns by the most controversial\nOmar (Riz Ahmed) struggles to keep a\ncool head around his band of deluded\nbrothers especially his lieutenant Barry\n(NigelLindsay);awhiteconverttoIslam\nwho seems only interested in destroying mosques to inspire the \u2018moderates\u2019\nto rise up. The lions are completed by\nFessal (a timid individual whose brilliant ideas include strapping bombs\nto crows) and the innocent Hassan\nand Waj who appear to be completely\nunaware of why they are planning the\nmassacres of their fellow countrymen.\nThe brilliance of Four Lions revolves\naround the fact that its protagonists\nappear to be completely ignorant of\nthe religion they are fighting a Holy\nWar in the name of. The terrorists\nare not shifty looking, \u201cdurka durka\u201d\nshouting stereotypes but your average man on the street. They undertake their activities with all the bumbling diligence of Dad\u2019s Army. Let\u2019s\nnot forget now that Four Lions is a\ncomedy and so the question begs - is\nit funny? Hell yeah, Chris Morris has\ncertainly not lost his touch and dollops\nplenty of comic brilliance into the film.\nFour Lions is hilarious and unsettling at the same time. Your sympathies towards the men conflict\nwith natural repulsion at the terrible\natrocities they are trying to commit.\nAs the film reached its climax I un-consiously found myself willing Omar\nand the boys to succeed before recoiling in uneasy horror at my thoughts.\nThe script bounces between well\naimed shots at the contradictions of\nextremism and moments of surreal ex-cellence. Omar explaining his predicament to his son by substituting himself\nforSimbaandOsamaBinLadenforMu-fasa is a highlight. A fieldtrip to a Taliban training camp in Pakistan results\nin pure slapstick involving a bazooka.\nCenturion delivers enough thrills and bloody violence\nJohnPark\nJohnPark\nDirector Neil Marshall\nScreenwriter Christian Colson\nCast Michael Fassbender\nCenturion\nCenturion may be a lot of things, but\nboring is certainly not one of them.\nThe brief running time of 97 minutes is\nhardly challenging to sit through, even\nless so, when it is filled with brutal,\nraw, medieval action that comes with\nthe ferocious looking warriors. In A.D.\n117, the Roman Empire is facing difficulties as it tries to expand its territory\nto northern Britain. The Picts are giving the Romans hell with their endless\nguerrilla tactics that have managed to\nslaughter thousands of soldiers. The\nRomans have had enough, and they order the legendary Ninth Legion to wipe\nout the Picts once and for all. But after\nan ambush on unfamiliar ground, not\nonly does most of the Legion perish,\nGeneral Virilus (Dominic West) is also\ncaptured. So now it\u2019s up to the surviving Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender)\nand a handful of soldiers (only seven of\nthem in total) to rescue him from the\nvengeful Picts. The seven brave men\nmust also be incredibly weary of the\nband of Pict hunters led by the ruthless Etain (Olga Kurylenko) who is\nout for some more Roman blood.\nAs can be expected, the action is\nliterally non-stop and the characters\nbarely have the chance to get a word\nin. A lot of the script is quite expect-edly filled with constant screaming\nbut it\u2019s hard to complain whilst so\nmuch gritty action is taking place. The\nfight sequences are relatively creative\nthroughout and they never become\ntoo repetitive. The scale of these\ncombats can never be too big,\nsince the number of soldiers\nwe\u2019re dealing with is limited,\nand the director knows that. Neil\nMarshall knows the limits and never\ntries to be too ambitious. He plays\nwithin the set boundaries and never\noverextends himself to create something he cannot control. The action is\nalways bloody and it would be wrong\nto expect anything but.\nMarshall also makes the wise decision of including some tense, cat-and-mouse situations whenever he\nfeels like he has had enough of the\nswords, spears and axes clash-ing. The chases are hardly original,\nbut the rapid editing and fast pace\nmove the film along so quickly that\nit\u2019s hard to care. As the characters\nspring, so does the audience. Because\nof this general rushed atmosphere,\nsome plot details are lost in the process\nbut again, it\u2019s easy to just forget about\nthem and get caught up in this high-energy, adrenaline-pumping ride.\nThe faultless casting is also something that adds to the film\u2019s enjoyment factor. The range of more than\nadequate British and Irish talent that\nincludes Fassbender, Liam Cunningham, David Morrissey, Noel Clarke\nand Riz Ahmed form a reliable, steady\ngroup, interacting convincingly with\neach other. Fassbender is fantastic as\nthe leader, showing both the strength\nand vulnerability of his character flaw-lessly. West, the macho general is also\nwell-cast, despite having some cheesy,\nepic-wannabe lines to churn out.\nKurylenko, although having absolutely\nno dialogue, compensates for this with\nher deadly, piercing looks, an appearance that practically screams ferocity.\nOddly, a romantic subplot develops,\nand no, it\u2019s not between the male sol-diers. A random, helpful, innocent-looking woman turns up out of the\nblue, suddenly having a major part to\nplay. The film quickly shifts its tone\nand decelerates. Frustrating, and perhaps a tad unnecessary but we all knew\nthis couldn\u2019t be 100% pure action. The\nintroduction of this character opens\nup the possibility of the film reaching a horrific conclusion and surprise,\nsurprise, this actually happens. Shame,\nsince the rest has been such an effective guilty-pleasure.\nThough the plot and character have\nnot time to develop fully, \u201cCenturion\u201d\nsatisfyingly delivers what is promised\nto: 90 minutes of hardly uninterrupted,\nhardcore action. If you\u2019re a non-action\nfan, this is clearly not for you, if not, as\nlong as you can be patient during the\nawkward romantic moments, the film\nwill prove to be tremendously fun.\nsurviv-ender)\neven of\nom the\nve men\nof the\nruth-o is\nd.\nn is\ncters\na word\nexpect-eaming\nilst so\nce.

Although the irony is probably deliberate\nto point fun at the ridiculousness of religious fanaticism, I found I could not\nfully identify with the protagonists and\ntherefore the emotional impact of the\nending was weakened. However, Four\nLions is still a fantastic dark comedy but\nthen I expected nothing less from Morris.\n(cont.)\n\n"

Cameos from Rahul Pai and Navin Surtani\nlifted the total before IC were bowled\nout in the 48th over for 210. This was\na modest total but given the nature of\nthe pitch, Imperial\u2019s bowlers were confident with their ability to defend the\ntotal.\nA good start was necessary and Viran provided this with a very impressive opening spell of 3-26 from 10\novers, and he could have had more\nwickets if his keeper and slips had provided more support. Surtani, plugging\naway at the other end, lacked victims\nto go with his control. Despite the loss\nof these three wickets, Portsmouth\nwere threatening to get away from Imperial, with some very nice shots from\ntheir batsmen. Fortunately, Superman\nPatel again stepped up with a beautiful\nspell of 3-28 from his 10 overs, removing the middle order that had looked\nlike winning the game for Portsmouth,\nwhile at the other end Hemal Malde\nkept things tight, bowling line and\nlength to restrict the batsmen. However, as the frontline seamers ran out\nof overs, spinners Sompalli and Pai\ncame on. With little help from the\npitch, or Imperial\u2019s catching, the Portsmouth number 7 chanced his arm in\na fortunate and fighting 50 to set up a\ntense finish; Portsmouth needed 5 an\nover from the last 10 with 3 wickets in\nhand. Surtani returned and Musgrave\ncame on to both bowl very tidily, with\na wicket apiece, and \u201ccome the mo-ment, cometh the man\u201d with Majid\n(not normally a death bowler) stepping\nup to bowl and take the last wicket;\nchopped on to the stumps with just\nenough force to dislodge a bail and end\na thrilling match with a deserved win.\nWith three wins in three, Imperial look\nto make it four out of four and all-but\nsecure promotion.\nMen of match \u2013 Ankit Patel & Viran\nParmar (equal votes)..\n****\nAfter two disappointing perfor-mances, Imperial 2nds hosted Reading\n3rds in a relegation dog-fight. All was\nwell in the morning until Rohan Babla,\nclub secretary, somehow decided that\nthe start time was 2pm instead of the\nwidely publicised 12:30. After a sociable journey West to T6 with the 1st\nteam, Pete decided there were no detours needed and the rest of the journey was uneventful.\nAfter delaying the match as much\nas possible so that there was a chance\nRohan would arrive, Pete relented and\nwent for the toss, which he won and\nthus decided to bat. The opening partnership of Jonny C and Yash, the 3rd in\nas many games, got off to a good start\nwith a year-record opening stand of 15\nbefore Yash got out for a solid 12. Afterwards, things looked up and in contrast to the 1st XI\u2019s comedy top-order\nbatting on the other pitch, the 2nds\nprogressed nicely to 156 for 5; Jonny\ngetting 20, Joe Dearsly 34 and fresher\nSid a serene 57. With the platform set\nfor a big score, the loss of Sid lead to\nthe inevitable collapse to 200 all out;\nLuke Smith smashing a quick-fire 14 at\nthe death.\nFeeling extremely pleased with the\ntotal, Pete and his troops went in for\ntea and to refocus for the second half\nof the game.

It\u2019s legal,\nbut that don\u2019t make is a good fucking\nidea now does it?\nIf you want lengthened, and possibly more accurate rendition of this\nweek\u2019s political news, I suggest looking elsewhere.

The protest letter\npushed the influential Russell Group\nto make their recommendations to\nthe Browne Review publically available alongside every other institutions\u2019\nequivalent reports. They additionally\nrequested a solid timetable for future\nreview submissions be laid down after\nbeing given the vague timescale of \u201cthe\nnext few weeks\u201d for this submission.\n\u201cAs student representatives, we find\nit disingenuous and underhand that\nthe UK\u2019s elite universities have refused several freedom of information\nrequests asking for its submissions to\nbe published,\u201d said Akpan-Inwang.\n\u201cThe outcome of the Browne Review may represent the most significant change to higher education\nfunding in decades. It is completely\nunacceptable that it has been withheld until after the election and clear\nthat the Russell Group are attempting\nto stifle debate.\u201d\nThe at-the-door protest yielded a\n20 minute meeting between ApkanInwang and two Russell Group mem-bers, one being Director Wendy Piatt.\nTalking to felix, Apkan-Inwang described the discussions as \u201camicable\nand civil\u201d.\n\u201cI made the concerns of the Aldwych Group clear, and she [Wendy\nPiatt] sympathised. The meeting was\nabout clarity and she gave assurances\nto us that their submissions would be\nmade public. I think they had plenty\nof time to think about their decisions\nbefore we turned up.\u201d\nWith the Russell Group seemingly\ntaking a U-turn in their decision to\nkeep their documents confidential\nand publishing their submission by\nthe end of the week, Apkan-Inwang\nchampioned the power of student\nrepresentation.\n\u201cWe represent 20 institutions coming together, and our views are difficult for the Russell Group to ignore.\nThere was also plenty of media coverage from the BBC and local newspapers,\u201d he said.\nHowever, upon contacting the Russell Group, a spokesperson refuted\nthe idea of their decision regarding\nconfidentiality had been reversed\nin response to Monday\u2019s letter of\nprotest.\n\u201cWe always intended to make the\nsubmissions publically available, but\nwe are publishing them to our own\nschedule. The publication of the reports this week has nothing to do\nwith the Aldwych Group,\u201d she said to\nfelix.\nSpeaking about the Russell Group\u2019s\nsubmission to the Browne Review,\nDr Wendy Piatt, Director General\nbacked up these claims.\n\u201cThe Review invited those submitting evidence to indicate whether\nthey would prefer that evidence to\nremain confidential. There is and has\nalways been an intention to publish\nour submission and our final analysis\nof the issues addressed in the submission,\u201d she stated.\nThe Russell Group has taken up the\noption of confidentiality given by the\nReview during the submission pro-cess, but have stated that they would\nonly exercise this option in accordance to their own investigations upon\nsimilar matters.\n\u201cWe are working on our own in-dependently-researched report into\nthe issues surrounding the funding\nof higher education. We submitted\nour early findings for this report to\nthe Browne Review in time for their\nfirst deadline and asked the Review\nteam to treat our advice as confidential pending the publication of our\nplanned reports on the funding of\nuniversities and further analysis of\nthe issues involved,\u201d Piatt said.\nSo, was the organised handover of\nthe protest letter a waste of time? At\nthe very least, the Aldwych Group\nhave established the report\u2019s date of\npublication as Friday 14th May.\nDespite imminent publication, Union President Ashley Brown was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that the Russell Group\nhad hindered any chance of higher\neducation debate at the General\nElection.\n\u201cIts disappointing that this General\nElection wasn\u2019t about higher education which is vital to securing our\neconomic recovery and affect the futures of millions of people. We want\nan open debate on the issues, which\nwasn\u2019t achieved by the Russell Group\nkeeping their submission confidential\nfor so long,\u201d he said.\nThough the Russell Group expressed confusion at the students\u2019 appearance on their doorstep, The Aldwych Group have stated that they are\n\u201cjust happy that the [Russell Group\u2019s]\nreport is going to be published and\nwe will be able to see what they have\nto say.\u201d\nApkan-Inwang will now look to review the Russell Group\u2019s publication\nnext week and make contact with all\n20 offices of the student unions in\nEngland as they pay \u201cclose attention\u201d\nto the Russell Group\u2019s next moves.\nWho are the Aldwych Group?\nAs Imperial College Union are to Imperial College, the\nAldwych Group is to the Russell Group. It is the collection\nof the 20 student unions whose universities are part of the\nRussell Group. Imperial College Union have been an active\nmember since its inception.\nCurrent chairman and LSE Union Education and Welfare\nOfficer, Emmanuel Apkan-Inwang said the Group\u2019s job was\nto \u201cact and respond to the Russell Group accordingly, without\ncausing wider effects like the National Union of Students.\u201d\nThey look to lobby for the \u201cbest outcome for [their]\nmembers\u201d in all decisions the Russell Group make.\nThe Russell Group is an organisation\nthat represents the 20 leading university\nadministrations in England. These include\nOxbridge as well as Imperial, LSE and\nUCL. This means their report will hold\nplenty of influence in these early stages of\nthe Browne Review.\nThe conflict between the Russell Group\nand students arose when this report was kept confidential from\nstudents. Chair of the Aldwych Group, Emmanuel Apkan-Inwang\nargued that e\u201cstudents deserve to know what is being said by an\norganisation representing our universities.\u201d\n\u201cStudents deserve\nto know what\nis being said by\nan organisation\nrepresenting our\nuniversities\u201d\nWhy is this submission so important?\nPolitics\nPolitics\n13 Labour years: The\ngood, the bad & the ugly\nSee page 8\nSport\nSport\nFemale fencers top of\nthe felixSports league\nSee page 31\nAldwych Group Chair Emmanuel Apkan-Inwang with the protest letters\naddressed to two senior figures of the Russell Group\n\n"

Whilst the film\ndoesn\u2019t contain much direct\nblasphemy, it certainly is\nheretical by lampooning\nChristians as blind followers\nof anything. Many\nconservative councils felt the\nneed to ban it for years.\nThe Exorcist contains enough blasphemy\nto put the even the least pious priest into\na catatonic state for years. Apparently\nthis film gave my mother nightmares\nfor a month. However, I found it scarily\nhilarious. Mary Whitehouse was out in\nfull force during the screenings offering\nreligious counselling to the victims of\nit\u2019s audience. Why is it so offensive? A\ntwelve year old girl doing unpleasant\nthings with a crucifix and her privates\nand the infamous head spinning scene.\no\nFreaks was critically panned\nand caused so much distress\nto its audiences that it was\nalmost forgotten about until\nresurfacing as a cult classic\nviewed at midnight\nscreenings. It was\ninfamous for the\nuse of real sideshow \u2018freak\u2019\nactors .\nIn my opinion A Clockwork Orange is\nthe most perfectly directed film of all\ntime by the master of cinema Stanley\nKubrick. Malcolm McDowell played\nthe leader of his gang of \u2018Droogs\u2019\nwith utmost glee as they engaged in\nultraviolence and raped. Banned in\nBritain at the request of the director.\nThis film re-invented the\nhorror genre and it\u2019s\naudience were witness\nto the brutal antics of\n\u2018leather face\u2019 and his\nfamily of murderous\ninbreds. The onscreen\nviolence was taken to a\nnew level but the film was\nnever banned in the UK.\nBanned in the UK until 2000, this film\nis the definition of the word \u2018nasty\u2019.\nSet in the facist sate of Salo in Italy\n1940, a group of high raning officials\nkidnap eighteen young men and women\nand force them into a world of sado-machoism and coprophagia. Based\npartly on Dante\u2019s Inferno and the\nMarquis de Sade\u2019s book of the same\ntitle, many felt that this was a snuff\nmovie dressed up as an art film.\nI couldn\u2019t find a picture for this film\nwhich I was sure wouldn\u2019t make\nsomeone vomit on sight. The visceral\nhorrors in Cannibal Holocaust were\nso horrible that it\u2019s director Ruggero\nDeodato was arrested on suspicion of\nmurder. The documentary style of the\nfilm convinced some people that it was\na real snuff movie. Ruggero managed to\nprove his actors were still in the land of\nthe living but his film faced international\ncensorship instead.\nThe furore surrounding Mel Gibson\u2019s\naccount of Jesus Christ\u2019s apparent final\nday is best demonstrated by the South\nPark episode The Passion of the Jew. The\noriginal passion plays were performed\nto incite anti-Semitism and so it was no\nsurprise that this film got critisised for\nthe same reason. The \u2018good\u2019 Jews look\nAmerican and the \u2018bad\u2019 Jews look evil,\nmake your own mind up.\nThis film is incredibly\nimportant in cinema history\nas it was the first real\nfeature length film to use\nall the techniques that\nare normal today such as\nmultiple shots in a scene. It\u2019s\na big shame then that the\nplot is about Klu Klax Klan\nputting them pesky ex-slaves\nback in their place after the\nAmerican Civil War.\nWith the recent release of Four Lions causing the raising of eyebrows amongst the more politically sensitive of\nour nation, Film Editor Ed Knock presents the various films that have courted outrage over the last century.\n\n"

    "content": "3\nfelix FRIDAY 14 MAY 2010\nNEWS\nImperial graduates \u2018will mould future\u2019\nS\nir Keith O\u2019Nions has emphasised the need for optimism amongst Imperial\u2019s\nlatest postgraduate students\nawarded degrees at the graduation ceremonies held in the Royal\nAlbert Hall.\nThe ceremonies, the largest postgraduate awards in the history of the\ncollege, where some 2000 students\nreceived their degrees, were watched\nby roughly 4700 guests. The ceremonies were attended by Lord Sainsbury,\nProfessor Robert Nerem and Professor Sir Andrew McMichael, who each\nreceived honorary degrees, as well as\nentrepreneur Ram Gidoomal, Chairman of Singapore\u2019s Agency for Science Lim Chuan Poh and Trustee of\nthe Wolfson Foundation Lady Wolfson, who were admitted to the Fellowship of Imperial College London.\nThe Rector, who described the\ngraduates as \u201cour greatest contribution to societies around the world\u2019\u2019,\nsaid: \u201cAs you now pursue and develop\nyour careers, you are amongst the\nmost talented and able people in the\nworld.\u2019\u2019\nHe continued to explain:\n\u201cAttributes such as pessimism and\nself doubt have always been in short\nsupply at Imperial College and would\nin my view be entirely misplaced at\nthese times. You have the knowledge\nand understanding that is key to\nmeeting the challenges and opportunities of tomorrow - you will without\ndoubt be part of moulding the world\u2019s\nfuture. Your skills, knowledge and expertise are necessary now more than\never, because it is only through innovation in science, technology and\nmedicine and sound business sense\nthat our economy will advance. We\ncan only guess at the advances that\nyour generation will make - but I am\nconfident you will be part of it.\u2019\u2019\nThe ceremonies celebrated staff and\nstudents who had made substantial\ncontributions, with Jad Marrouche\nof the Department of Physics receiving a Student Award for Outstanding\nAchievement to recognise his outreach work and Jane Mitchell from\nthe National Heart and Lung Institute receiving the Rector\u2019s Award for\nExcellence in Research Supervision.\nResearch Excellence Awards were\nalso given to two academic groups\nspecialising in molecular systems engineering and nanotechnology in recognition of research of significant future potential. The awards are worth\n\u00a3150,000 each.\nPostgraduates after the ceremony\nwere quick to mention their satisfaction with Imperial with comments\npraising the semi-taught, semi-re-search based approach employed in\nsome degrees, explaining that this\nhelped spark thoughts regarding\nwhether they\u2019d like to continue scientific research in future. AK\nAs 2,000 postgraduates were awarded degrees, Sir Keith O\u2019Nions told Imperial graduates that they will be able\nto be the future of science. He might just be right. Alexander Karapetian and Joanna Cai report.\nFlower Pot listens to Sir Keith O\u2019Nions intently as he proudly gradutes with a 1st in Material Sciences. A head full of mud, who\u2019d have thought?\nDoom and gloom in the job market? Think again\nA\nrecent poll by the Association of Graduate\nRecruiters (AGR) has shown that the latest batch of graduates now face improved\ncareer and job prospects, for the first time\nsince the recession took place.\nThe poll was carried out last month, surveying 91\nmajor graduate employers about their hiring plans for\nthis year. Two thirds of these companies said that they\ncurrently still had graduate vacancies, and according to\nAGR, the average graduate pay remains at 2008\u2019s levels.\nWhen asked about their recruitment targets for 2010,\n37.4% of employers said that theirs were higher than last\nyear\u2019s, 41.8% remained the same, whereas 20.8% were\nlower than last year\u2019s.\nGraduate level vacancies saw a 10% fall last year, when\nmany companies ceased to recruit graduates and some\neven withdrew their offers; the figures from this year\nhave almost levelled out.\nHowever, the students who are leaving university this\nyear will undoubtedly face competition from the graduates of 2008 and 2009, since many of them are still in\nsearch of jobs. This will mean that despite the currently\noptimistic figures for job vacancies, the competition will\nremain fierce for entry-level jobs, in which one in three\nrequires a degree as a prerequisite.\n71.5% of the companies asked confirmed that their\nnumber of applicants were higher than last year. It can\ncost employers up to \u00a33bn each year to run the business\nof recruiting, paying and training graduates, and employers will be working hard this year to try to attract the\nbest graduate talents, whilst forecasting the trends in the\ngraduate market.\nThere are currently over 900,000 unemployed under-25s: 100,000 of which are graduates.\nNevertheless, many employers recruiting graduates\nstill stress the importance of wider employability skills\nwhich are as, or even more, important than the specific occupational, technical or academic skills associated\nwith degree programmes. In a 2007 Institute of Directors (IoD) survey, 61% of members stated that graduates\u2019\nemployability skills were more important than academic\nskills, compared to only 12% believing that they were less\nimportant.\nA study carried out by Incomes Data Services found\nthat graduate recruitment in finance would increase by\n15% this year, compared to the drop of 38% last year. On\nthe other hand, the public sector and charities will see\nvacancies drop by 7% as a result of public spending cuts,\nwhich is also the reason for the recent strikes and sit-ins\nundertaken by members of King\u2019s College and Middlesex.\nDespite the recent increase in competition amongst job\napplicants, employers still find that applications are often bulk written and mass e-mailed to them, which does\nnot do the applicant any favours. In AGR\u2019s poll, only 29%\nof employers got the impression that applicants were\nworking harder on their applications in the current job\nclimate.\nFor students who are, or soon will be, embarking on\ntheir quest for that mysterious graduate job, it is important to remember that this generation of graduates will\nprobably have many careers and even more jobs within\ntheir working lifetime than any previous generation, so it\nis perhaps best not to consider a career as \u2018cradle to the\ngrave\u2019. JC\nProportion of companies whose\ngraduate recruitment targets remained\nthe same or increased from last year\u2019s.\n79%\n\u201cYou have the\nknowledge and\nunderstanding\nthat is key to\nmeeting the\nchallenges and\nopportunities of\ntomorrow\u201d\nThere are currently over\n900, 000 unemployed\nunder-25s, 100,000 of which\nare graduates.\n\n"

    "content": "27\nfelix FRIDAY 14 MAY 2010\nSPORT\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nteam had recovered to a very respectable 210, although certain (very) senior\nplayers were disappointed that the 2s\nhadn\u2019t managed to score more runs\nthan the 1s for once. With a spring\nin the step, the players went out to\nfield and some high quality opening bowling from Jonny C (3-13 from\n10 overs) lead to the dismissal of the\ntwo openers in successive overs with\ntwo unplayable balls. The previously\nwayward captain, who wasn\u2019t exactly\nleading by example at the time, then\ngot in on the act to remove the third\nbatsman to leave Reading reeling. An\ninspired bowling change by Pete lead\nto debutante Will Baker collecting two\nwickets, before things got better when\nthe only credible spinner, Luke, came\non and took quick wickets (and ended\nup with figures of 9 overs 3-14). Pete\nthen came back to wrap up the innings\nas Reading were bowled out for 108, of\nwhich 50 was extras. This aside it was a\ntop-quality performance to give the 2s\ntheir first win of the season. The man\nof the match was, without doubt, Jonny C for his all round performance: 20\nruns, 3 wickets and two catches. Geek\nof the day could only go to Ben Bell for\nbeing sad enough to spend tea break\nworking out the countdown puzzles\nthat were on TV and consequently being prime evidence that playing Hockey has a negative influence on you.\n****\nStirred from their first win in over a\nyear, an energized Imperial 2nd team\ngathered together for their next game,\nplaying Portsmouth to seal their position in the division. With a strengthened batting line-up and a typically\nstrong bowling attack along with two\nextra spinners, things were looking\ngood. An uneventful journey was a\nrelief in contrast to earlier this month\nwhen the team managed to get lost on\ntheir way to Harlington. Upon arrival,\ntraditional pre-game rituals were un-dertaken; Pete went to buy some food\nfor tea and Sid had a fag.\nOn a green wicket, softened due to\nthe rain, bowling first seemed the way\nto go; but losing the toss, IC were put\nin to bat. After a strong bating performance from last game, IC were keen to\nrepeat their performance. Joe started\nthe innings soundly and looked like he\nwas geared up to get a big score with\nmore leaves than a tree. Unfortunately,\nat the other end, Rahul, his opening\npartner, was dismissed in the second\nover.\nSasha came in all guns blazing and\nbought the team a quick start before\noffering a catch to mid-off while looking to clear the infield. This triggered\nthe haunting collapse that the seconds\nexperience all too often; Alex being\ntrapped lbw and Sid falling cheaply after sending a sitter back to the bowler.\nCaptain Pete also fell under the pressure and the biggest blow came soon\nafter when Joe was also out leg-before.\nBut heroics from Ian at the tail end of\nthe innings, with support from Will\nBaker and Will Duncan, allowed IC to\nset a target of 140 and give the bowlers\nsomething to work with.\nAfter tea the team was ready to bring\ntheir best to defend a low total. But a\nquick start from the Portsmouth openers started to put some heads down\nbefore Sid\u2019s loud mouth ensured some\nbanter; the breakthrough came and the\nopening duo of Ian and Pete seemed\nset to cause some havoc as they had\nin Sussex. With a wicket apiece they\nhad the Portsmouth team under pressure as Will\u2019s sharp stop and accurate\nthrow provided another wicket but\ndespite all this, runs were still flow-ing. Joe bowled a top spell of leg spin,\ngrabbing two wickets; his googly completely deceived the batsman who left\nthe ball only for it to hit the top of the\noff stump.\nThis gave IC another burst of energy\nas the main threat to the team was now\ndismissed. But alas, with only 140 to\ndefend the quick start from the Portsmouth batsmen turned out to be too\ntall an order for the bowlers to contain as the final runs were scored with\nease. The team, unhappy with their\nperformance, headed up to the Red\nLion to drink away their sorrows. Will\ndominated the pool table and a good\ngame of killer came to a thrilling end\nwhere Rahul\u2019s accuracy conquered\nSid\u2019s flukes.\nThe team now has to prepare for\nwhat will be a competitive game\nagainst Brunel on Wednesday, where\na win would solidify their position in\nthe league.\nT\nhe felixSport league table championship for the\n2009-2010 season was\nshared between Fencing\nWomen\u2019s 1s and Volleyball Men\u2019s 1s. The female fencers were\nable to boast a superior point differ-ence, however, it would have been\nunfair to demote the volleyball players\ninto second place due to the different\npoint scoring systems between the two\nsports. Both the fencing and volleyball\nteams completed their respective seasons with unblemished records; the\nfencers emerged victorious from their\neleven bouts while volleyball secured\nten victories throughout the season.\nWhile most people have a general\nunderstanding of what the sport of\nfencing is about, the vast majority of\nthe public don\u2019t know the rules regual-tions and procedures of the sport as\nit does not command the same level\nof publicity as the national sports of\nEngland such as football, cricket and\nrugby.\nFencing has a long historic tradition\nand is one of only four sports to have\nmade an appearance at every one of\nthe modern Olympic Games. Fencing competitors have a selection of\nthree weapons; epee, foil and sabre.\nWhen competing, rules specific to\neach weapon must be observed when\ndueling. In epee and foil, points are\nscored with the tip of the weapon on\na valid target area whereas sabre calls\nfor a slashing motion, hitting the opponent with the side of the blade. The\nareas which competitors target differ\naccording to the weapon, and hits are\nregistered electronically with the use\nof a \u201cbox\u201d that lights up. The general\naim of a bout is simple - to outscore\nyour opponent.\nEpee uses a slightly heavier weapon\nthan foil or sabre and allows hits to be\nscored on the whole body. The foil target area removes the head, arms and\nlegs and is materialised by a metallic\njacket which registers hits by completing a circuit between the foil and the\nbox. The sabre is similar to the foil in\nweight and length, and the attacker\nmay target anywhere from the waist\nupwards. There is a right of way rule\nin fencing which is implemented in foil\nand sabre to prevent simultaneous at-tacks, epee being the only weapon to\nallow double, hits. Judging the right of\nway can sometimes be quite subjective\nand many a match will be decided by\nthe referee.\nBUCS team matches involve a\n45-point relay for each weapon. The\nteam for a singlee weapon is comprised\nof three people, each fencing three\nbouts to five hits, with the first team to\n45 being the winner. The scores from\neach weapon are then added up to give\na total out of 135, which explains the\nvery large \u2018goal difference\u2019 the fencers\nhave.\nfelixSport caught up with Clare\nHarding, captain of the successful\nfencing team to discuss their successful season: \u201cSix girls were on the team\nthis year: Alice Mitchell, Outi Supponen, Emily Bottle, Hannah Bryars,\nHelen Pennington and myself\u201d. The\nContinued from back page\nImperial 2nd XI overcome Reading 3s but are unable to repeat feat against Portsmouth\nseason began with high expectations\nwith the team winning their league the\nprevious year. \u201cThis season saw Alice\nand Outi join the team, both of whom\nare experienced fencers so we were\nfairly confident that we would be able\nto repeat last year\u2019s feat!\u201d\nOxford University provided the stiffest competition for Imperial within the\nsouthern league this season: \u201cOxford\nbeat us in 2009, but it was incredibly\nclose with the teams only separated by\na few points. We knew that they had\nlost a few of their key competitors from\nlast year and on the first two occasions\nwe met we managed to beat them quite\neasily. This was mainly thanks to the\nstrength of our epee and foil teams.\u201d\nThe Imperial team faced Oxford for a\nthird time this season and were able to\nkeep level headed and see of their challengers for a third time within a season.\nAfter an undefeated season, plenty\nof exceptional moments stand out:\n\u201cThe highlight for the team was probably the BUCS semi-final victory over\nOxford- when we met them the third\ntime. The team felt a lot of pressure to\nwin that match in order to qualify for\nthe final in Sheffield\u201d. The victory was\neven more impressive as Imperial\u2019s opponents contained some competitors\nfrom the British circuit. \u201cLuckily the\nteam pulled through really well and\nproduced one of the most resounding\nvictories of the season\u201d.\nPromisingly, Clare believes the team\nis unlikely to change drastically going\ninto next season: \u201cWe compete in small\nteams so there can be large changes\nfrom year to year and it\u2019s encouraging\nthat the team will not change too much\nfor the coming season\u201d. Furthermore,\nthe club was able to put out a second\nteam, captained by Helen Pennington\nwho is a part of the first team; this can\nonly improve the prospects of Imperial\u2019s fencers. \u201cThis allows far more\npeople to compete at a University level\nwhich is a great way to retain novices.\nHopefully in future years we will be\nable to recruit from here which will\ngive the team added depth.\u201d\nfelixSport announce the World Cup league table winners\nAsmen\u2019svolleyballandwomen\u2019sfencingcomeoutontop,wetalktothemtofindoutmoreaboutwhatgoesintoanunbeatenseason.Thisweek:fencing\nName: Clare Harding\nAge: 23.\nSubject: First year PhD in\nMicrobiology and Molecular Cell\nBiology.\nHeight: 5ft 1\nWhile studying at school, Clare\nrepresented Scotland and Great\nBritain at U17 level.

Intelligence reports were far from convincing and in the end the sources came\ndown to mere rumours. Still that was\nnot how Blair portrayed it and Britain\nwas taken to war, following Bush.\nWhile Britain was fighting on two\ndifferent fronts, expenditure on the\narmed forces barely grew. In fact\nBrown, after telling the nation and\nthe House for months that spending had increased in real terms, was\nforced to eat his words and apologise.\nIn the end no government will ever\nbe perfect, that\u2019s why we vote them\nout.\nNew Labour had a significant and\nlikely long-lasting impact on Britain.\nMany of their intentions were good\nas indeed were many of their achieve-ments, but after 13 years they have\nhad there chance, at least until the\nnext General Election.\nWatching the massively underhand\nway the Lib Dems played their cards\nthis last week, I expect they will pull\nout of the coalition as soon as a referendum on PR is passed causing the\ncollapse of the government at the immediately following Queen\u2019s speech\nor budget.\nHowever, this decentralisation of\npower from Westminster and Whitehall has far from been the story of\nLabour. The past 13 years have seen\na massive accumulation of power at\nWhitehall into the hands of democratically unaccountable civil servants and across the country into bureaucratic quangos.\nThe result of this has been a series\nof top down targets being set with\nlittle to no reform of the institutions\nbeing run. One appalling outcome of\nthis has been that while exam results\nhave been steadily rising, the British\neducation has been falling in international leagues.\nOther cases of this poor system for\nrunning the public services have been\nseen in almost all walks of life. Huge\nprojects such as the national database\nfor the NHS has soaked up enormous\namounts of money with no gain at all.\nIn general the NHS has not improved\nas much as might have been hoped\nconsidering the vast amounts of\nmoney poured into it. Workers in services such as the NHS and the police\nhave also complained the amount of\npaperwork they are required to fill\nin that feeds back into the Whitehall\nbureaucracy machine. This is instead\nof spending time providing care or\ncatching criminals.\nUnder Labour we have seen an\nenormous repeal of civil liberties in\nresponse to the rise of extremist Islamic terrorism. The scale of this really has been repulsive, with, in my\nview, the worst act being to allow trial\nand then thrown at any given problem\nit kind of had to.\nLabour spent a great deal on the\nNHS and the improvements, especially in waiting times, have been\ndramatic: average waiting times have\nfallen from nearly 18 weeks in 1997\nto around 6 weeks today. Record\nnumbers of NHS patients are satisfied with the quality of care they re-ceive, and the country has also seen a\nfall in crime rates, especially in areas\nsuch as violent crime during Labour\u2019s\ntenure.\nLabour also implemented the Sure\nStart programme which has been\ngiven a resounding thumbs-up by\nnew parents as an all round centre for\nearly child development and support.\nOne of the first actions Gordon\nBrown took was to make the Bank of\nEngland an independent body, a wise\ndecision that helped to keep interest\nrates low during the good times and\naided efforts in stopping the recession becoming worse than it has been.\nThe minimum wage was a Labour\ncreation as well, before its implementation several captains of industry\nwarned against it, but there will be\nfew people in the country who would\nwish to see it abolished now. Had it\nnot been for this it is likely that the\ndifference in wealth between the\nvery wealthiest and the very poorest\nwould be even larger than it is now.\nIn an unusually liberal move, it was\nGordon Brown remembers he has already sold the nation\u2019s gold reserves.\nLooking back over the Labour years\nR\nousseau once wrote \u201dThe\nEnglish people believe itself to be free; it is gravely\nmistaken; it is free only\nduring election of members of parliament; as soon as the\nmembers are elected, the people is\nenslaved; it is nothing. In the brief\nmoment of its freedom, the English\npeople make such a use of that freedom that it deserves to lose it\u201d.\nSo with the one day of freedom we\nhad, in what will now be a fixed 4\nyears, the outcome of that day was a\ncoalition government. Personally I\u2019m\npleased to see the coalition which is\nsaying it will scrap the worse pledges\nlike raising the inheritance tax threshold and most of the Lib Dem manifes-to, and is instead promising more sensible sugestions like scrapping income\ntax for the first \u00a310,000 and most of\nthe Conservative manifesto.\nIn about a month normal service\nwill resume and we can all get back\nto blaming the Government for every-thing. So rather than make wild predictions about what the future may\nhold I\u2019ve decided to take this opportunity to look back on the 13 years of\nNew Labour and see what went right\nand what went wrong under some ridiculously clich\u00e9d subtitles...\n\u201cA new dawn has\nbroken, has it not?\u201d\nSometimes, a convincing finger point is all that\u2019s needed to take a nation to war\n\u201cBritish jobs for\nBritish people\u201d\n\u201cNo return to Tory\nBoom and Bust!\u201d\nThe Good\nWhen Labour surged into power\nin 1997 their campaign song was\n\u2018Things can only get better\u2019. Undoubtedly the country has improved\nin many respects since then. Frankly,\nwith all the money that was borrowed\nThe Bad\nwithout a jury- what had been a fundamental component of our judicial\nsystem.\nThe Lisbon treaty paved the way for\na more powerful EU which in turn\nmeans a less powerful British parlia-ment. On this issue Labour had promised a referendum, though this never\nhappened and as a result the British\npeople had no say in the matter.\nThe majority of newly created\njobs in Britain over the past 13 years\nhave been in the bulging public sec-tor, while this has been part of the\nforce behind improvement in public\nservices, it has not helped provide a\nroute out of recession. At the beginning of the Labour era there were\nroughly five million people living on\nbenefits and there still are.\nThe ugly\nUntil Bigotgate, Brown\u2019s most famous\nphrase was that he had ended boom\nand bust. A claim that came back to\nbite him during the worst recession\nBritain, and the world at large, had\nseen in decades.\nOf course Gordon didn\u2019t cause the\nrecession, but his years of deregulating the city certainly didn\u2019t help.\nSplitting up the responsibility for\nmonitoring the banks between the\nFSA, the Treasury and the Bank of\nEngland is thought to have slowed the\nrecognition of a problem and coordination of a solution.\nDr. Brown\u2019s apparent success as\nChancellor was built almost entirely\non unsustainable borrowing and his\nselling of British gold reserves at a\nvery poor moment show that he was\nnot some kind of financial wizard but\na conjurer of cheap tricks., By cheap, I\nmean economy cripplingly expensive\ntricks.\nLabour\u2019s most lasting legacy will be\nthe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Realso under Labour that the Freedom\nof information act was passed. This\nhas had a great impact on making\ngovernment more open and making\ngovernment statistics, figures and\nthe rest available to a greater range of\npeople.\nLabour has also ushered in a greater social tolerance to Britain with\nlaws such as those allowing for civil\npartnerships.\nPerhaps one of the greatest achievements was to bring about the end of\nyears of violent trouble in Northern\nIreland. The Good Friday agreement\nof 1998 and the 2007 deal between\nunionists and republicans will hopefully bring about a lasting peace and\nan end to the terrorist threat from at\nleast one area of the world.\nNew Labour also gave the go ahead\nfor the Scottish and Welsh assem-blies, both of which gave people a\ngreater say over the governance of\ntheir parts of Britain, and perhaps\neventually should the people of those\ncountries so desire, independence.\nJames Lees\nJames Lees Politics Editor\nTony Blair, May 1997\nGordon Brown, Sept. 2007\nGordon Brown, Sept. 2000\n\n"

I don\u2019t think\nanybody would think it particularly rude of a foreign citizen\nnot to take an interest in our politics as\nhe may fear, but writing five columns\nabout the failings of British politics\nand elections without providing either\nconstructive feedback or a balanced\nargument is a different matter.\nI\u2019d be the first to admit that our electoral system has its downfalls, but it also\nhas a lot of positives too. Moreover, for\nthose who plan to spend the majority of\ntheir lives in the UK, it is of great con-sequence. I completely accept the right\nto comment, but let him who is without\nsin cast the first stone. Show the British\nelectorate, parliament and government\na perfect democracy and we\u2019ll fall for\nit, head over heels, I promise you! But,\nwhile that utopian system still eludes us,\nwe\u2019ve got to work with what we\u2019ve got.\nIs that really something to complain\nabout using complex metaphors and to\nderide using long words? The electorate\nknows of the system\u2019s failings, but if, as\na country, we wish for electoral reform,\nthey will vote for a party, such as the Lib\nDems, who promise it.\nMr Amit, you mention insults on Facebook towards our politicians who\nadvocate change as \u201ca disrespectful way\nto address\u2026a politician\u201d\n. To me, this behaviour seems quite healthy; politicians\nare like Marmite and there are always\ngoing to be differences of opinion and\nno matter how well a politician runs a\ncountry, there are always going to be\npeople who speak out against him or\nher, even if some of it is quite crude. I do\nfind it slightly hypocritical you can criticise those people whilst simultaneously\nshowing disrespect towards those same\npoliticians by implying that all they do is\nemit \u201ccopious doo-doo\u201d\n.\nChange, and resistance to change, are\nmainstays of democracy and even if the\nUK\u2019s main parties have similar policies\nit is not fair to judge them, their leaders and their policies by commentating on the state of the country and its\nsociety before they\u2019ve even been voted\nin. This country has been democratic\nto varying degrees for centuries and I\ninterpret the lack of extreme views in\nthe three main parties as a sign that the\nBritish electorate thinks that this country is working well and requires only a\nlittle fine-tuning. Furthermore, the fact\nthat the population of this country has\nhad cries of \u201cChange!\u201d thrown at it from\nevery direction is, for me, a victory for\ndemocracy in this country, rather than\nan irritation. British citizens have been\nprovided with many sources of information and opinion that, hopefully, allowed them to make an informed choice\nlast week. It shows passion and conviction on the part of our politicians. This\n\u201csensationalist mess\u201d may be boring for\nsome, but it was necessary, in my opin-ion, to ensure that the election reflected\nthe beliefs of the British people. An election without campaigning and calls for\nchange would be a sad day for democracy anywhere.\nLike I mentioned before, there are\nmany faults with the electoral system\nin the UK. For one, in Great Britain you\ndon\u2019t have to show ID to vote (strangely,\nit\u2019s required in Northern Ireland). Postal\nvotes have been bought and polling stations closed with queues outside, and\nthere is an overriding unfair advantage\nfor Labour. I believe that we need electoral reform but a blanket PR system\nwould remove many of the positive eccentricities of having constituency MPs.\nI propose a halfway-house, where larger\nregions of the UK (such as Scotland,\nWales, the South-East, London etc.)\nelect a certain number of MPs on a PR\nsystem, allowing voters to hold local\nMPs accountable whilst providing a system which creates a more representative\nParliament.\nThis country is diverse, with regional\nvariations in history, geography and language as well as politics. Harking from\nYorkshire, I feel great regional pride and\nanyone can see that these emotions of\nlocal belongingness are felt right across\nthe country.\nThe British political and media establishments aren\u2019t blind to this and\ncertainly don\u2019t believe that the public\ncan\u2019t think for themselves. If the public\ncouldn\u2019t think and was homogenous,\nwhy would the government have introduced devolution? And since the UK is\nexposed to roughly the same newspa-pers, television channels and websites,\nwhy did the Conservatives gain so many\nseats around the UK, yet they lost share\nof the vote in Scotland? It is impossible\nto put the UK\u2019s 60m inhabitants in to a\nwell-defined box labelled \u2018the general\npublic\u2019\n.\nThe United Kingdom has had a long,\nconfusing and slightly eccentric history,\nand this is reflected across the country\nin our streets, pubs, humour, values,\nworkplaces and in our electoral system,\nwhich for all its faults has many positive points. If people wish to criticise it,\nthey may. But, as I\u2019m sure Gordon would\nagree, only bigots criticise others\u2019 systems without recognising their virtues.\nI\n\u2019ll try and keep this brief, not\nleast because we\u2019ve all got exams we should be studying for.\nAlso, I\u2019m thinking most people\nare getting a little bored of the\nelection talk. I\u2019ll tell you now that you\nmight as well skip to the last sentence\nfor the key point of this article....The\nbig debate that is flying around at the\nmoment is reforming the electoral sys-tem. My guess (and hope) is that you\u2019ve\nargued it through at your leisure and\nhave more or less made up your mind\non where you stand on the various different systems available. Taking that as\nthe case, I won\u2019t go into huge detail trying to persuade you round to my view.\nThere are good points for and\nagainst all the different voting systems,\nand there is clearly no single perfect\nsystem, such is life. However, there is\na large and increasingly vocal group\ncalling for the introduction of Single\nTransferable Vote (STV). STV put\nsimply is larger constituencies, with\nmultiple representatives in each, on\nyour ballot paper you rank the candidates in order of preference, some\nmaths happens and you get a group of\nwinners (like in the Union elections).\nLike I said, I won\u2019t go into much more\ndetail here, have a look on the internet for a better explanation (try \u201cJohn\nCleese PR\u201d). The key benefits are that\nit would take the voting power away\nfrom the marginal seats and distribute\nit more evenly around the population,\nthat you have a better representation\nof the views of the voters and that you\nstill have local MPs (albeit a bit less \u201clocal\u201d). It won\u2019t solve all the problems in\nthe world, it does have its downsides\nas all things must, but the benefits are\ngreater and many more.\nUnder the current system it is possible to get an increase in votes (and\ntherefore popularity), but a decrease\nin seats (and therefore power). That\nisn\u2019t right, it isn\u2019t democratic. The current system is outdated and needs to\nbe radically reformed. No government\nwill give us this easily. As I write this\nCameron and Clegg are looking round\ntheir new address, deciding where to\ndraw the line down the bedroom. They\nare trying to fob us off with the Alternative Vote system. This doesn\u2019t go far\nenough and will not make a significant\ndifference. We, the people, need to demand reform. Real reform. This is why\nI\u2019m calling you all to join the demonstration in Parliament Square at 2pm\ntomorrow (Saturday) to present our\ndemands, and make this government\nwork for us.
