We are,\nhave been for more than 10 years, the largest manufacturer of\ndiesels in the world.\nYou must have heard dread tales of men and women\ngraduates taking two years to find out what industry is all\nabout-before the penny drops. On the contrary, at Perkins\nwe use your knowledge-and indoctrinate you\u2014with a speed just short of indecent haste.\nGet stuck in! Doing a real job is the only way to learn.\nConsider the engineering graduate at Perkins. His first\n6 months supply the concentrated training in tools, materials\nand technology that the Professional Institutions require. He\nis then plunged into production, work study, tool proving,\netc., if he is interested in production. Or engine research or\ndesign, if he is interested in product development. Further\nmanufacturing training or engineering experience follows\nbefore a final 12 weeks devoted to training in a specific\njob function.\nEach graduate programme is individually planned and\nincludes tailor-made projects, special assignments, tutorials.\nWe are a world-active company: every one of our graduates\nis encouraged to study a foreign language by language\nlaboratory techniques.\nAt Perkins the penny drops early.

Perry, Employee Resourcing Services Manager,\nPerkins Engines Company, Eastfield, Peterborough.\nRepresentation on the Board of StudiesTHE STUDENT CASE\nby Dave Wield\nSome years ago, IC was not at all backward in student involvement on College Committees. Even before the recent demands by University students for more say in the way they\nwere educated, there were students on a large number of I.C. committees, e.g. Refectory,\nAthletics, General Studies, student residence, etc. Because of this relatively liberal attitude shown by the College, it was not sur pris ing that students did not press their case for\nrepresentation to the limit two years ago. Instead, students considered that a forum for\ndiscussion between the Rector, Deans, Governors, and students would be adequate to\nput the student point of view to the College authorities.\nIt was obvious to the students last year that this was\nan inadequate way of discussing important issues. There\nwas no junior staff representation. A decision on disciplinary procedure in the\nCollege, after many hours\ndiscussion had to be deferred\nbecause wardens of Halls\nhad not been consulted and\nwere dissatisfied. In short,\nJURGO was not being taken\nseriously.\nIt was with this in mind\nthat the students' Union asked for observers for a limited\nexperimental period to be\nplaced on the Governing\nBody, the Finance & Executive Committee of the GoB\n(which deals with the day-to-day affairs of the GoB) and\nthe Board of Studies. To our\nsurprise the Board of Studies refused our request.\nThis was indeed a shock.\nThe right of students to be\nrepresented on most decision-making bodies in the College\nhad never been contested\nbefore. The Board of Studies is the first Committee to\nrefuse to have students on it.\nHypocrisy\nThe minutes of the meeting which made the decision\nmake interesting reading.\nCriticism of these minutes\nhas been widespread, not just\namong students, but among\nlarge numbers of members\nof staff. The hypocrisy of\nsome members of staff becomes very apparent. Professor Chain, for example,\nworries about \"political activists\" and describes our re-This article was originally\nwritten to be published with\ntwo other contributions from\nmembers of the Board of\nStudies, one agreeing with\nstudent representation and\none against. Unfortunately,\nthe members of staff approached have been unable,\nor in some cases unwilling,\nto contribute. The article\nshould not be considered as\na complete case for representation, merely one stu-dent's impressions of the\nnegotiations to date.\nContributions on the subject from members of staff\nare very welcome; any staff\nmembers interested in writing\nan article should send it to\nthe Editor of Felix, Union\nbuilding. D. V.W. quests as \"a misconception\nand distortion.\"\nThe difference between our\narguments, which have\nalways been purely educational, and his and some of\nhis colleagues, which are\nblatantly political, is self-evident.\nStudents have never spoken about \"the duty of Imperial College to show\nleadership\", \"Imperial College doing a great service to\nthe country\", \"lead in the\nnational scene\". These political slogans have no relevance\nto academic and educational\nmatters.\nWhy, then, are we so annoyed about this apparently\nirresponsible attitude shown\nby the Board of Studies?\nBecause any body which\nadopts a serious reasoned\nand responsible attitude in its\nrequests expects a similar\nattitude in its reply.\nForum\nThe Rector, in his reply\nto our original request, did\nnot mention most of the reasons for refusing. He states\n\"the Board feels that it is\nessential and not unreasonable that there should be in\nthe College a forum to allow\nfree, uninhibited discussion\nby members of the academic\nstaff, of matters affecting the\nformulation and direction of\nacademic policy.\"\nMembers of staff, of\ncourse, can have as many\nforums for discussion as they\nwish. Students have never\ntried to stop discussion in the\nCollege. On the contrary, it\nwas students who first suggested holding the teaching\nMethods Conference \u2014 and\nwho at that Conference suggested having an open discussion forum of academic\nmatters. It was students who\nmade the request for junior\nstaff members to join the\ndiscussions at JURGO.\nThe difference between a simple discussion forum for\nmembers of staff and the\nmost important academic\ndecision-making body in the\nCollege is obvious.\nNo Secrecy\n[CU feels that any body\nas important as the Board of\nStudies \u2014 which makes decisions of such far reaching\nimportance about the education of students\u2014cannot be\nkept secret. ICU is not alone\nin these attitudes. The ViceChancellors and NUS agreement is favourable, and it is\nsupported by the Department\nof Education and Science.\nThe Vice-Chancellors & NUS\nagreement was signed by\nrepresentatives of the IC\nauthorities last year.\nStudents at Imperial College fed that they have a right to sit as equals on such\nCommittees. They believe\nthat students can make a significant contribution to the\nwork of the Board, and that\nthe presence of students will\nnot only be of great value to\nthe student body, but also to\nthe College as a whole.\nCOL CUT TA new term starts at Imperial College, centre of academic excellence, where the people are so exclusively masculine that they have to have a separate single-sexed bar for\ntheir extra-curricular activities; Where five hundred people\nspend an evening crammed in a concert hall gasping for a glimpse of gyrating genitalia; Where the only thing that will\nattract the masses to a Union meeting is an attempt to throw\nout the president.\nImperial College, the most advanced technical institution in the country, where the thirst for booze is so pronounced that they have to have special clubs for it, with old\nand glorious traditions, like bouncing up and down on\nUnion property, or getting a smacked bottom because you\ndon't wear your tie on the right day: Imperial College, school\nof alcoholism; purveyor of puke.\nAnd what have we in store for us this term? Will somebody put LSD in the beer at a Mines Union Meeting? Will\nthe Rugby Club cease their booze-ups after matches and turn\non to marijuana? Will slogans of \"Come back C2, all is for-given\" appear on noticeboards? Will the Domestic Bursar\nbe found one night with a girl in his room? Or will the\nworld shattering events of last term repeat themselves and\nbore us to tears once more? With a gigantic retch, I.C. heaves back to life.\n\n"

WITH\nTHE ARCHITECTURAL ASSOCIATION\nDiscussion on the idea of the Architectural Association school( about 500 students in Bedford Square) merging with Imperial College began over nine years ago, since then the negotiations have taken many turns, but only recently have fundamental differences come into the open. Negotiations are now in a critical stage, the merger is due to be signed in August 1970,\nTHE RECENT NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE A. A. HAVE REVEALED ATTITIDES OF I.C. WHICH ARE OF\nFUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE TO EVE-.Y STUDENT IN IMPERIAL COLLEGE AND THE A. A. On participation the official Imperial College view, which is backed by the Imperial College Board of Studies is that there are FOUR RESERVED AREAS WHERE STUDENT\nPARTICIPATION IN THE PROCESSES CONCERNED IS UNACCEPTABLE.\ni \u201e Selection and examination of students ii \u201e Withdrawal of students on the;'' grounds of academic insufficiency iii. Appointment of staff iv.. Ultimate decision making. This fact came out, in a clear form, of the merger negotiations between Imperial College and the Architectural Association( in Sept.69, backed by the I.C. Board of Studies in Oct.69). The 4 reserved areas are primarily a produce ot I \u201e C, though\nthe University of London regulations are slightly relevant to some.\nThe Architectural Association( AA) have been told categorically that since such participation ic unacceptable in I.C, then it will be unacceptable for AA students when they come to I.C. The AA School one of Britain' s oldest and most famous schools of Architecture has ex ten r.i vc participation in these four fields and has functioned in this way very successfully for many years. The staff and students of the AA school are naturally very anxious to preserve their high successful and desirable level of participation. Imperial College Admin, and Professors is attempting( perhaps without knowing\nit) to destroy this participation, despite the fact that I.C \u00ab Union has already stated( Oct 69) that 'because the AA has greater participation than I.C., it does not feel that their level of participation should be in any way decreased in order tc match\nours' \u201e\nThe two working parties; co K\",g rna d v/ith the merger\nThe 10th Meeting of A A/lC negotiating committee was held on December 17th,1969. Student Presidents of ICU and AA School were present for the first time. I.C.U. President asked ( with support from others present) for student representation on the two working parties of the negotiating committee concerning acad eir dc and administrative matters The Rector said' no', saying that i. to allow such participation would\npreempt any decisions by the Board of Studies InfraStructure Working Party recently set up by the Rector and ii \u201e such representation wo.il d imply that students should be\nrepresented on the proposed Board of Architectural studies, which is to report to the\nBoard of Studies and be analogous to the I.C. Engineering Board, on which there is no\nstudent representation. The Rector said that the Board of Studies would consider possible student participation on the proposed Board of Architectural Studies but was\nnot able to forecast a result favourable to the AA\u201e No agreement was reached over' the four reserved areas'., THE REASONS PUT FORWARD FOR NOT ALLOWING PARTICIPATION IN\nTHE TWO WORKING PARTIES OF THE NEGOTIATING COMMITTEE ARE LUDICROUSI\nThe Role of the University of London The Academic Registrar of U~L, states that the role of the University in the merger is largely con csr ned with finance and that most matters are primarily the concern of I.C.. but UL re gul at i ns do not provide for student representation on bodies concerned with the appointments of readers and professors.

This straight legs and\narms attitude is most unfamiliar after the sit up and beg\nposition of most student\nmachines.\nThe engine power is the\nnext thing to get used to.\nWith a3 litre V6 engine producing about 140 bhp, and a top speed of just over 115\nmph, this compares with my\nvan which has a948 cc, 38\nbhp straight four and a safe\ntop sped of 70 mph. The\nacceleration was tre men dous. Roadholding is excellent and should be with 185\nsection (i.e. fat) Pirellis all\nround. Big disc brakes on the\nfront make sure that braking\nis strong and fade free.\nThe gear lever was badly\nplaced and had too long a travel. Changing into 2nd or 4th brings your forearm\nagainst the glove box. However apart from a rather low\nsecond gear, the ratios were\ngood and the overdrive on\n3rd and 4th was also good.\nOverdrive on a car like this\nis a boon, and at 70 mph in\noverdrive top, the rev counter was reading 2800 rpm.\nSo at motorway speeds of up\nto 100 mph the car is loafing\nalong.\nThe V6 engine is the same\nengine that goes in Ford\nZodiacs and 3 litre Capris\nBeing relatively untuned it\nreturns excellent fuel con-WARNING\nHEALTH HAZARD\nThe complaint known as Moronicus Leftism, or Mao's sickness is now recognised as not if i able, on the grounds that\nmost of the victims are mobile health hazards.\nThe following notes will\nenable the general practitioner to identify and treat\nthis malady.\nThe symptoms: The\npatient becomes rapidly\nmore hirsute, particularly\nabout the head; he will begin to identify his clothing\nas a battered pelt rather than\nas an official covering. The\ncondition often results in the\npatient looking more like\nprimitive ape-man than a human being.\nCoupled with this rapid\nphysical decay is an equally\nrapid mental deterioration,\nthough the victim is able to\nspeak (which they do inde-fat iga bly) and remains just\ncapable of operating a duplicating machine. The results\nof these efforts make little\nsense, as if the victims have\nno notion as to the meaning\nof the words they use, neither\ndo they appear to comprehend when spoken to, though\nthere is a curious rapport between victims (c.f. communication in lower primates).\nThe vision of the patient is\nshort-sighted\u2014this may be\npartially cured by use of\nsecond-hand glasses or even\nby a pair of lenses supported\non fuse wire.\nCauses: Unknown; present\ntheories include partial evolutionary throw-back, or that\nthe victim is shrouded by a hairy parasite. The former\ntheory is supported by the\nevidence of unusual fertility\n(?) rites held in Grosvenor\nSquare, while the latter\ntheory better explains the\nvictim's appearance.\nTreatment: There is no\nknown form of satisfactory\ncure but the disease will often\ndisappear after a few years.\nHowever, the health hazard\npresented by the victims may\nbe curbed by suitable treatment on a sheep farm, where\nthe patient may be clipped\nand shorn. Apart from this,\none can only wait and hope\nthat the patient will eventually regain his mental f acul ties.\nDoctor X( Name supplied)\nU.S.A.

The peak power is\ndeveloped at a low 4500 rpm\nand the engine sounded\nrather noisy over 5000 rpm.\nThis encourages change ups\nat 5000 or below and this\nfurther helps the fuel con-sump tion. The engine is such\nas logger that at one stage\nwe took off from the lights\nin 3rd without too much\nbother.\nBehind the driver are two\nreasonable seats with adequate leg room. However if\nthese are folded down, a mammoth platform is made.\nIn fact it is 57 inches (145\ncms) long and this consumes\nvast amounts of luggage or\nanything else you want in\nthe back.\nThe attractive glass fibre\nbody comes in a range of\npleasing colours. Having an\nestate car type back window\nmeans that dirt collects all\nover the glass. The G TE now comes with a two speed\nelectric wiper and electric\nwashers as standard, and\nvery useful too.\nAll in all it is a very desirable car and definitely a good swap for my van.\n* * * *\n* * * *\nThis decade will see tremendous upheavals in the Third\nWorld and in British Education. Can Imperial College meet\nthe challenge of either? Can Imperial College take a lead in\nproducing the broad minded socially aware graduates with\nthe organisational and critical facilities so necessary for\ngrasping the relationship between the 3rd World and the\nWest? Will the major Union policies \u2014 Which attempt to\nhelp meet this aim \u2014 be met with this term or this decade?\nMajor Union policies are being answered with \"No\" or\nerosive excuses.\nLast November 14 'the Rector set up a Working Party\nto investigate the committee (infra) structure of the Board\nof Studies. The terms of reference of this Working Party are\ntoo limited, it has not met yet, and is now being used as an\nexcuse to prevent proper participation in discussion concerning the Architectural Association. We have agreed to cooperate with this Working Party but there is a possibility\nthat the Architectural Association will refuse to do so.\nIn the A. A. negotiations the College has stated 4\nreserved areas of no student participation, I think that if the\nA. A. community is to mean anything When it comes to I.C. these reserved areas must be abolished.\nThe Pro-Reotor's( October 29) diversification co-or dina tion committee has not yet met, although some useful collecting of information has been done as part of its programme.\nHeads of departments, and the Board of Studies must agree\nto the establishment of a dept/office of non-teo hn i ical studies\nand before that gets under way they must introduce existing\ncourses on a college-wide ostensible basis and cut out some\nof the unnecessary detail in some of the existing main\ncourses.\nThings are moving very slowly on Senior Common\nRoom usage and approximately not at all on a say over\nthe appointment of certain non-academic staff.\nIn conclusion, a lot will happen this term. Union\ndecisions are important and need mass support so make sure\nyour dept. and year reps, keep you informed \u2014 and come\nto UGM's. "

Al Stewart is probably better known,\nhaving had several records re-ted with safety belts). What\nbliss ! Except for the electric\nguitars, of course. Now don't get me wrong ! The electric\nguitar can be a very effective\ninstrument (although nothing\nlike the real thing), but it can\nbe very dangerous in the\nwrong hands and it often gets\ninto them.\nThe number of places in\nwhich you can seek refuge\nfrom noise decreases daily. In\none of the college toilets the\nother day I was amazed to\nhear the sound of Radio One\nleased. He is an admirer of\nBob Dylan but is most influenced by Paul Simon and\nBert Jansch.\nTickets are 5/-, 7/6 and\n10/- from the carnival office\n\u2014you'll see posters around,\ndon't ignore them, it should\nbe well worth the money.\nemanating from one of the\ncubicles. Only with the utmost difficulty can 1 refrain\nfrom commenting upon this.\nWorst Enemy\nIt seems there is nowhere\nto hide. A cinema queue in\nthe West End might seem a peaceful enough place to\nspend a couple of hours in\nthe rain; but no ! A young\nman with a guitar around his\nneck (yes, around his neck\nfor goodness's sake) will approach and proceed to strum\nand sing. Once you have been\npicked for a target there is\nlittle you can do. I even gave\nmoney to one once but he just\nwent on playing as if 1 was\nhis worst enemy. I really\ndon't mind people falling on\nhard times but I wish they\nwould do it in private.\nOne of the most powerful\nmeans of distributing noise is\nthe hop. Having once lived in\nOld Beit I can write from experience on hops. My window\nwas unfortunately placed and\nby an architectural fluke the\nsound was louder in my room\nthan in the concert hall.\nTicket buying friends envied\nmy location but I considered\nfour hours of incessant pop\nmusic for nothing to be pretty\npoor value for money.\nHowever on several occasions I have attended one of\nthese incredible functions\nwith the object of seducing\nyoung ladies. I once noticed\na friend of mine standing apparently alone and jigging\nabout. Noticing my amazement he explained he was\ndancing and indicated his\npartner who was standing\nabout ten feet away. This was\na revelation. I hadn't realised you could claim to be\ndancing with someone so far\naway but I quickly caught on\nto the idea. That night I danced with some of the prettiest girls in the room and\nnot one of them felt a thing.\nIt spoils things when it's too\neasy though, doesn't it ?\nFind the Lady\nI 've not limited my escapades in London to hop\ngoing. Many a Saturday\nmorning has ben spent strolling in Portobello Road\nwatching the newly arrived\nAmerican tourists taking\nphotographs of the trendy\npeople who are really American tourists who have been\nhere a week, (you don't think\nanyone would really dress up\nlike that, do you?). It is a fascinating place, though.\nThey play the mysterious\ngame called \" find the lady \".\nThey line up three people\nand you have to guess which\none is the girl.\nNothing has been spared\nin my attempt to join the London scene. I started going to\nHenry, \"looking for myself\" :\nI suppose a few visits convinced me I had been there\nall the time. I even obtained\na computer date convinced\nthat the electronic brain\nwould calculate a perfect\nmatch for me. But she never\nreplied to my letter. I suppose she must have flipped\ninstead of flopping. Maybe I was a bit too choosy anyway.\n(Women of over twenty stone\nwho collect Dinky Toys must\nbe quite rare). Anyway,\nwherever you are Gladys, just\nsend me the 10/- and we'll\nforget all about it.\nIt appears that I'm just not\na trendy person. I haven't the money for a pink shirt\n(nor the body) and no matter\nhow careless I am I can't seem to get white paint on\nmy jeans. And when you're\nan un trendy person with sensitive ears then London just\nisn't the place for you. However I 've thought of a solution to both problems:\u2014I shall grow my hair long for\npeace\u2014when it gets over my\nears it will keep out the\nnoise.\nGolly\nCAREERS FOR GRADUATES\nWITH\nHALL-THERMOTANK\nINTERNATIONAL LIMITED\nTHE LEADING UK REFRIGERATION AND AIR CONDITIONING COMPANY In 1970 we want to recruit\nMECHANICAL, CHEMICAL AND ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS AND\nGRADUATES IN OTHER DISCIPLINES We are visiting\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE on 4th FEBRUARY to see applicants\nARRANGE TO MEET OUR REPRESENTATIVE THROUGH THE APPOINTMENTS BOARD\nCARNIVAL CONCERT\n\n"

    "content": "Page 4 FELIX 15th January, 1970\nSwedes have problems too\nThe Students Union of the\nLund Institute of Technology\nin Sweden was host to students from many European\ncountries for an International\nStudy Week at the end of the\nlast summer vacation. The\naim of this week was to compare methods of technical\neducation in Europe and to\nhelp Swedish students formulate ideas for modernising\ntheir education system.\nThe courses at the LIT are\narranged so that students\nprogress from year to year\nafter passing certain exam-i nations. These examinations\nare held after every course of\nlectures and repeated 2 or 3\ntimes during the year. Students can thus take the\nexaminations 3 or 4 times\nwithout falling behind, but\nthere is no compulsion to\ntake or pass these examinations\u2014in fact only 15% of\nthe students complete their\nstudies in 4 years, 37% take\n4-5 years and 18% 5-6 years;\n85% of students complete\ntheir studies ever (up to 9-10\nyears!) No student can be\nasked to leave his course, but\nmoney from the State becomes progressively more\ndifficult to obtain with length\nof time spent on a course.\nWhy arc the success rates\nso low? It is difficult to pinpoint one specific reason. The\nentry requirements for a technical university are very\nhigh, only the medical\nschools set higher standards,\nso certainly the students are\nnot dim. The examination\nsystem leads to an attitude of\n\" well, so what if I fail, I can\nalways take it again\". The\nruthless (by comparison) IC\nmethods produce more\ngraduates more efficiently\nwith similar teaching and\nlaboratory facilities, the only\nsignificant difference is the\nlack of a tutorial system in\nSweden (tutorials are like\nbowler hats and fish and\nchips, typically British).\nToo Agreeable\nI think that the main\nreason is that the student is\nliving at a very high\nstandard. All students receive\na grant of \u00a3100 P.A. plus a loan of \u00a3700 p.a. repayable\nat a low rate of interest over\nabout 25 years. Student\naccommodation is excellent\nand puts Britain to shame,\nonly married students are\npermitted to share rooms\n(they generally have flats provided by the university), the\naverage student pays \u00a34-\u00a35\nper week for a bed-sitting\nroom not unlike our Halls of\nResidence. There are enough\nrooms for all so the student\ncan keep his room for as\nlong as required\u2014most\nrooms are in modern blocks\nowned and run by student\ncooperatives. Most students\ncook their own meals\n(restaurants tend to be ex-the same price as in London\nthe same price as London\none can soon realise how\nmost students are able to run\ncars and buy expensive hi-fi\nsystems and televisions. Why\nshould this affect examinations? My answer is that the\nSwedish student finds life too\nagreeable, he faces no hardships like an early morning\nride on the District Line or a bad bed-sit in Fulham, he\ncan study at his own rate of\nprogress and has no worries\nabout being rejected by the\nuniversity. His only worry is\nhis money; even this is not\ntoo bad, he is guaranteed\n\u00a3800 p.a. for 4 years regardless of parental income and\ncan probably arrange a5 th year as well. So why should\nhe work hard and spoil the\nenjoyment of the best years\nof his life? In my opinion it\nis an example of lack of fore-sight, a lack of realising how\nmuch improvement in living\nstandards can affect\nacademic work.\nI wish that IC could avoid\na similar mistake, but in view\nof the cessation of construction of new student accommodation in South Kensington of a respectable standard\nand the general national\neconomic situation 1 think it\nimprobable that we shall be\nfacing these problems in the\nnear future.\nRoss Maxwell\nPrincipal Edwards\nMagic Theatre\n\" Soundtrack \"\nDandelion 63752\nThis album title best sums\nup the group, for their act\nnot only consists of the\nmusic, but almost every\naspect of art. Comprising\nfourteen members this\nbranches to give two dancers,\ntwo light show operators, one\nnarrator and sundry others\nas well as musicians.\nSo just listening to this\nalbum is not adequate to\nappreciate the group fully.\nThe light show in itself re-f lects, by films and slides, the\ntheme of each number and\nthe dancers complete the\nvisual effect.\nPrincipal Edwards have no\nworries as they are mostly\nExeter University students\nwho have taken the year off,\nand their happiness, especially of vocalist Vivienne, is\nreflected in their songs.\nOn record the items performed range from Shakespeare's\" Third Sonnet to\nSundry Notes of Music \" set\nto music in a semi-Elizabethan/semi-rock at mo sphere, through \" Pinky, A Mystery Cycle\", a mythological personification of the\nmoon, to \" Enigmatic Insomniac Machine\" a song\nby a girl lying awake beside\nher sleeping lover.\nUnfortunately their single\n\" Ballad \" is not included, as\nthis was one of the best\nsingles of 1969, but other\nmaterial such as \" Sacrifice \"\nand \" The Death of Don\nQuixote\" is equally enjoy-able.\nFairport Convention\n\" Liege & Life \" ILPS 9115\nFairport Convention has\nundergone several changes in\nthe group, each time producing different sounds. But this\nlatest arrangement (or rather\nup to a few weeks ago), with\nthe addition of Dave Swarbrick and drummer Dave\nMattacks, seems to produce\nthe most natural and gentle\nsound of all.\nSandy and Dave's previous\nexperiences in the folk world\nseem to have influenced the\nchoice of material, with no\nless than five traditional\nEnglish numbers. Every one\nis well arranged, and Sandy's voice is just about perfect for\nthe backing provided.\nSongs written by the group\nare \" Crazy Man Michael \"\nand \" Farewell, Farewell\" by\nRichard Thompson, both\nbeing soft ballads, and\n\" Come All Ye \" by Sandy,\nwhich can best be described\nas a beckoning call to the\ngroup.\nThis record is the first of\nits kind to successfully restore the English folk song to\nits rightful place and bridge\nthe gap between folk and\nrock. It provides a most enjoyable album of the group's short lived experience in this\nfield.\nBert Jansch Sampler\nTra Sam 10\nTransatlantic have produced a number of different\nsamplers over the past few\nmonths. This latest one\nseems exceptionally good\nvalue at 15/5 as they seem to\nhave chosen some of Jansch's most well known tracks.\n\"Anji\", a Davy Graham\nstandard, is one on his first\nL.P., as is \"Needle of\nDeath\", his own personal\nsong about drug addiction.\n\" Go Your Way My Love \"\nand \" Wishing Well\" are\nboth written by Ann Briggs,\nwhom Jansch admires very\nmuch indeed. Two more well\nknown tracks are \" The First\nTime Ever I saw Your\nFace\", a Ewan MacColl\nsong, and \" Nott amun Town \", a traditional number\nfrom the second Fairport\nConvention L.P. This one fifth of the Pentangle virtually has the history\nof his success summed up in\nthis record, and any novice\nguitar players listening to it\nwill realize how much further\nthere is to go up the ladder\nof progress.\nPhil Taylor\n\u2022\nFive-sixths of the Fairport Convention\nDon't fight over it\nWe know that lots of you want\ndetails of graduate careers with\nBritish Leyland\u2014and really, it's not surprising1. We are the only\nmajor British owned motor\nmanufacturers, Britain's fifth\nlargest company by sales value, and\nits largest exporting company.\nNot to mention our outstanding\ntechnical achievements\u2014the\nfront-wheel drive transverse engine\nconcept, hydro last ic suspension,\ngas turbine development, fixed head\ndiesel engines, semi-automatic\ntransmissions on trucks, and\n\"Prestal\", a new alloy.\nBut such a diverse range of\nactivities needs more and more\ngraduates of all disciplines, for\nfifteen major functions in six\ndivisions of the Corporation.

Accordingly, we\nsent one of our ace reporters\nto interview one of the co-chairmen of WHO. Firstly he\nasked about co-chairmen,\nwhy not just one chairman?\nOur contact said, \"I think\nthe idea was to remove the\npossibility of anyone taking\nover WHO for self-aggrandizement. So, when we are up\nto strength we have 4 co-chairmen, one from each\nconstituent college and one\nin charge of the alarms for\nMIKE (that's me). At the\nmoment, the R.C.S. co-chair-man is trying to get a degree, Guilds failed last\nyear, and I haven't heard of\nMines for months. Personally, I want to get a degree,\nand any time left over I am\nforced by evil task-masters\nto work for another college\norgan, as you know. The\nother star members of WHO\nare either working hard for\ntheir pass degrees or working\nfor various college publica-t ions.\" I am worried about next\nyear, as the people with any\nknowledge of WHO are all\n3rd years and there will be\nnobody left next year to\ncarry on the good work.\"\nFELIX asked if the remaining members of WHO\nhad lost interest. \"Yes, T think so, as far as acquisition\nis concerned I don't think\nthere is anybody left with\nsufficient interest. As for my\nspeciality, keeping MIKE,\nwe designed an alarm system\nwhich should be pretty well\nfoolproof, it would take me\na good hour to think of a way\nto abduct MIKE, and I know the system. Last year,\nwe had the system 80% fin-is he d, but there is still a lot\nof work to be done, and I am the only one with sufficient knowledge of electron-nics and the desire to get the\ndamn thing finished that I New Physics Exams\nThird year Physics undergraduates are to participate\nin an experimental examination at the end of this term.\nThe staff-student committee,\nafter investigating the inadequacies of the present\nexam system and several\nalternative methods, has\nsuggested setting a Graduate\nRecord Exam on the lines of\nthose used by the PrincetonBerkdley - Evanston Educational Testing Service. The\nquestions are designed to test\nspeed of understanding and\nability to marshal facts and\narguments. It is hoped that\nthe exam will not just test\nthe candidates memory and\nspeed of writing.\nSuch exams have been\nused and well received in\nNorth America for some\nyears.\nThe Graduate Record\nExam system consists of a series of statements about a particular situation. Each\nstatement is followed by a set of 5 possible answers or\ndeductions, and the candidates must select the best\nalternative.\nExample: A friction less ideal\nheat engine operates between a heat reservoir at 227 degrees\ncentigrade and one at 27\ndegrees centigrade. The thermodynamic efficiency of this\nengine is: (A)40%,(B)45%,(C)60%,(D)88%,(E)100%. On the three hour paper,\nabout 100 questions wMl be\nset, with no limit to the\nnumber of questions to be\nattempted.\nIn a circular to all third\nyears students, the staff-stu-dent committee asks for student co-operation in the\nexperiment in order that\nboth students and examiners\nmay objectively judge how\nthe results of the Graduate\nRecord Exam system compare with those of traditional\npapers.\nThe committee emphasises\nthat the exam is ex peri men tal, and will not count in any\nway towards final degree\nclassification.\nknow of in the college. It\nwould take me a month, doing nothing else, to get the\nsystem finished.\"\nJust how complicated is\nthe system, we asked. \"Well,\nwithout giving too much\naway, I say say that the full\ncircuit diagram would involve many sheets of fool-s cap. We estimate that, if we\nhad paid for all the electron-ics, it would have cost several\nhundred pounds, as it is, I think we have spent about\n\u00a330 so far. We started off\ndesigning a system to protect\nMIKE and the plinth, then\nwe sat and thought how the\nprotective devices could be\ndisabled and designed protective systems for them, then\nwe sat a few more hours and\ntried to think how we could\ndisable the protection of the\nprotection and protected\nthat, and so on, until we had\neliminated just about everything but the human element.\nBy that I mean people who\nhear alarms in the night,\nswear, turn over, caress their\ngirl friends, and go back to\nsleep. Perhaps we could reduce this risk by inventing\na Science Fiction type ray to\nbring on mass menstruation,\nthen, with nothing better to\ndo, people might come along\nto save MIKE.\"\nFELIX asked where\nMIKE was at the moment.\n\"Can I see your union card?\nWe have tried that method\nof getting mascots!

There are to be\nthree courses available.\nMoral philosophy, twentieth\ncentury history and drama.\nThese will carry no exam\ncredit, will \"unfortunately\"\nclash with lectures and will\nnot be included in the tutorial system.\nAlthough Professor Jones\ncertainly never said as much,\nthere was a feeling among\nmany of the students that he\nthought non-technical studies a waste of time, and that\nwith so little encouragement\nfrom the department, such\nstudies would never get off\nthe ground.\nSocial\nSouthside\nInterlude\nDuring the first three days\nof the Christmas vacation\nthe \"National Revolutionary\nSocialist Student Federation\"\nheld a conference in the old\nUnion building. FELIX is\nunfortunately short of reliable reports on what was\ndiscussed. However, some\ndifficulties arose over their\ngenerous nature. Some of\nthem who were sleeping in\nbooked rooms in Southside,\ninvited their friends in to use\ntheir floors.

Brighter, we hope, but still\ncovering the serious side of IC.\nRemember \"No free Beer for the British \"? Clive Robinson's letter to FELIX condemning George X's views on\nOverseas Students was cut by the FELIX editorial staff\nbecause we thought, and still think, that parts of it came\nunder 'defamation of character\" and shouldn't be published.\nWe feel the edited letter we printed was sufficiently critical,\nand stated Clive Robinson's views as he intended, without\nsinking too low into mud-slinging. Clive Robinson disagreed.\nCEFE promptly printed extracts from another Clive Robinson letter which duly made its way here, attacking FELIX\nfor \"butchering\" his letter without giving him prior warning.\nThe letter isn't published here, it was 600 words long and\nparts had already been published in CEFE; but I'd like to\nstress one point:\u2014 regardless of whether Clive's letter was\nstrictly libellous or not, FELIX is not a combat area for any\ntwo people to hold a slang ing match. Many people must\ndisagree with Justin Johnson's near-extremist views, but if\nthey cannot criticise without resorting to hurling abuse, we\ncan't print it.\nThe first week of the 70s saw the \"first formal IC Union\nNewsheet\" appear to join FELIX, the Constituent College\nNewsheets and CEFE in spreading joy to the masses.

May I express the hope that we shall take up our matters of grievance not directly related to students with our elected members at Westminster and not waste time at Union meetings.\nIt would then be possible for Union meetings to be shortened\nand reduced in number.\nDoes anyone seriously consider that a motion passed at\nImperial College, or even by all students in Britain, will\ninfluence Apartheid policies in South Africa or United\nStates involvement in South East Asia ? Many students\nhave other things to do at lunchtime on Tuesdays and\nThursdays, and although I am prepared to attend a reasonable number (2-3) of Union meetings each term, I find it\nimpossible to attend the number of lengthy meetings held\nlast term.\nYours faithfully,\nRoss Maxwell\nProfessor defends Board of Studies Editorial note: The following letter has been received from\none of the several members of the staff asked to write an\narticle for Felix on the subject of representation.\nI do not think any useful purpose would be served by my\ncommenting in Felix on the recent decision of the Board\nof Studies not to allow student representation for a trial\nperiod of one year. Like the majority of my colleagues, I am now responsible for this decision by default as I was\nunable to attend the meeting.\nBy publishing extracts from the confidential minutes of\nthe June 12th Board of Studies meeting, it has been very\neasy for some people to represent the professors as the John\nBirch Society of South Kensington who regard the generation gap as a ditch to be defended to the last man lest\nthe country be over-run by\nlong-haired revolutionaries\n(\"Hey, punk, where are you\ngoing to with those beads\naround your neck? ! \"). This\nis misleading and unhelpful.\nThere is very general\nagreement among the staff\nI have talked to that College\nBoards and committees dealing mainly with routine business are not well suited to\npromote the changes necessary from time to time to\nmaintain Imperial College as\na seat of learning of the\nhighest quality and ensure\nthat its activities continue to\nbe relevant to the society in\nwhich we live.\nFollowing a suggestion put\nto the Board of Studies,\nmachinery is now in motion\nto set up an infra-structure\ncommittee (or committees) to\nstand between the Board and\ndepartmental com mi11 ees\nwith representation from\nstudents and staff at all\nlevels. This is intended to\nprovide a forum for new\nideas and be a place where\nsteam can be generated behind the good ones vI believe this is a positive and\nhelpful idea and hope that\nstudents will back it. Every\neffort should be made to see\nthat something fruitful comes\nout of it which will be of\ngenuine benefit to the whole\nCollege.\nYours sincerely,\nP.T. Matthews\n(Professor)\nDear Sir,\n1 want to bring to the\nnotice of your readers the\nfalse and misleading title\nused by the Editor of Felix\non Clive Robinson's letter in\nFelix (Dec. 4th).I will admit\nthat the British male students\nwere not invited to the party\norganised by O.S. C.( Overseas\nStudents Committee\u2014Ed),\nand I would like to thank\nClive Robinson on his realisation of hard facts), but to\nsay that \"No Free Beer for\nBritish\" (in Felix) is extremely provocative. As a matter of fact, beer was sold\ncheap.\nThe many overseas students attending a party is an\nexperience in itself. Any encouragement given to an\noverseas student, who has inherent inferiority complex\nand is conscious of his inability to speak English lan-gu age, must be welcome. If\nany British student thinks\nthat all a student coming\nf iom overseas needs is a technical education at home,\nthen he is no different in his\nattitude from those who represent the generous aid-giving\ngovernments of the Western\ncountries.\nThere are several other experiences which an overseas\nstudent lacks; like social get-to-gethers, open debates, organisation and administration\nof Unions, etc. If an overseas student is to obtain\nall round education at I.C. he must be encouraged to\nexperience various things,\nsometimes exclusively.\nWith 20% of the student\npopulation being from over-seas, I think we are making\ntoo much fuss about the\nparty given by O.S. C.A.W. Date,\nMech Eng PG.\nEditorial note:\nThe above letter was forwarded to me by Ken Barker,\nRSM Newsletter, and is published without alteration.\nLetters to the Editor\nare always welcome.\nCopy date for the next\nissue is January 2l st; please limit letters to\n300 words where pos-sib le. The Editor reserves\nthe right to omit all or\npart of any contrib u tion. The opinions expressed in letters are\nnot necessarily those of\nFelix.\n\n"

It's too neat, too in\nand everything in it is calculated to appeal. Both the\nmain characters do all the\nright things, cook all the\nright foods and each has the\nright job. John admirably\nplayed by Dustin Hoffman is\na furniture designer, while\nMary (Mia Farrow) works in\na gallery selling ethnographic a. If there was ever a film designed to be commer-cia l, then this is it. There is\nvirtually no plot, but the\naction, which is set in New\nYork contrasting with the\nbook, which was set in Highgate, happens on many weekends in various halls of residence in College. It was probably because I felt I'd seen it\nall before in real life, that in\nplaces it started to pall.\nThe film opens with John\nand Mary waking up together\non a Saturday morning. As\nJohn showers, the sound of\nrushing water merges into\nthe sound of a crowded bar,\nwhere John and a friend are\ntrying to pick up some\nwomen. He finally (via a little\nname dropping) alights on\nMary. The story follows\nROYAL P REPLY\n\"SOON\"\nAt his meeting last week\nwith Gerry Fowler, Minister\nof State for higher education at the DES, President\nCorbyn enquired about the\nUnion's pamphlet and letter\nto the Queen which was\npassed on to the DES. Mr.\nFowler said that we should\nexpect a reply soon.\nThe Minister at the meeting did not foresee at present an increase in student\ngrants this year and in discussion about the need for\nMaths graduates thought\nthat more scientists with\nmore maths would help but\nwas not totally a revolution.\nWHAT'S ON\nThursday, January 15th Scout and Guide Club:\nGuiding in the Seventies,\nMines 303, 12.35.\nWednesday, January 21st Folk Club present Leon\nRosselson at 7.30 p.m, in\nthe Union, top floor.

It ends, as it began with them jumping into\nbed with each other again.\nOne amusing technique the\ndirector Peter Yates has used\nis to present John and Mary's thoughts in dialogue. Flashbacks of course are used\ncont ant ly. The performance\nof Farrow and Hoffman is\nthe sole redeeming feature of\nthe whole thing.\nMY NIGHT WITH MAUD\nIn case you haven't been to\nsee one of the best films of\nlast year (My Night With\nMaud), then it is still on at\nAcademy One. Jean Louis\nTrintignant and Francoise\nFabian star in a witty subtitled comedy, made incidentally in black and white.\nThere are some amusing\nsequences on the lines of the\nseduction scene in the Graduate, when Maud a very attractive divorced woman tries\nto test the morals of a professed devoted catholic. The\nending is a little predictable\nbut the presentation is delicate and extremely credible.\nGood acting throughout.\nDustin Hoffman and Mia Farrow\n(See Film Review above)\nLAM LEY'S A IMl iE| PAPER BACKS\nSTATIONERY\n1 EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.7 Read any good books lately?\nErnest He m'n \u00a7 way Kingsley /^mis\nDoris [_es sing Fyodor Qostoersky\nJane ^ us ten Vladimir |s| a boko v George gli ot LIBRARY2 nd floor, Library Block\nMon.-Fri. 10\u20145.30\nANDREW? photographic Phoenix is out\nYou may have seen those\nmysterious posters appearing\naround college recently asking 'Why Ever Did You Do\nIt Ethel?'

Training, however,\nstarts almost immediately in\nthe term, and much time is\nspent coaching the beginners\nwho, this year, are of high\nquality. This term leads up to\nthe long distance Head-ofthe-River races and the first\nsquad is already hard at\nwork. We boat three times a week and work in the gym\ntwice a week at weight and\ncircuit training.\nBeginners, however, can\nafford to go at a more leisurely pace. If you are 6ft.2 in s. tall and around thirteen\nstone in weight you have the\nideal build for an oarsman.\nIf you would like to try the\nsport we'd like to hear from\nyou.\nContact Vic Spencer in\nSelkirk 682 or turn up at the\nboat house any Saturday\nmorning.\nS.T.O.I.C.
