They beat the nearest chal-le nger, University College, by 2 points in a closely fought contest\n(55\u201453).\nThe meeting began with the 440 yd s. freestyle which Ray Harris\nwon by over a length to set a new championship record of 4m.51.1s., bettering the old record by 1 sec. His other two wins came in the\n110 yd s. butterfly and the 110 yd s. freestyle in which Steve Howarth\nfinished 5th. Keith Davies comfortably won the 220 yd s. breaststroke in 2m.58 sees, with Roger Guy placed 6th and Jeff Hook, the team captain,\nwas i ust beaten into 3rd place (73.7 sees) in the 110 yd s. backstroke.\nJohn Badmin was 2nd in the diving and at the end of the individual events. I.C. were 4 points ahead of U.C. The med lev so u ad of Hook.\nDavies, Harris and Chris Collier\nhad a great swim to beat U.C. in\nthe relay, which meant that the\nfreestyle squad of Davies, Tony\nMaycock, Collier and Harris had\nto gain at least 3 rd place for the\nteam to have an overall victory.\nThis they did in a race which\nwas won by the strong U.C. squad. The team is to be congratulated on their fine all-round\nperformance, particularly Ray\nHarris on his superb swimming to\nwin 3 titles.\nSquash\nThe first team has now begun\nto recover from its customary\nbout of defeats at the start of the\nseason. Recent results are a loss to North London Polytechnic after a hard match, followed\nby wins against Guys Hospital\nand Kings College. Another\nmatch was won by forfeit, bringing the accumulative results to :\nlost 3, won 3.\nThe glorious team is the seconds which has defeated all opponents so far in the League (six\nmatches). The members of this\nillustrious band have become\nbrave enough to challenge the\nfirsts to a match.\nLeague rules allow staff players,\nany I.C. staff are very welcome to\nJoin the Squash club and try for\nteam places. It would be particularly useful to have more\ngirls .available for competition\nmatches.\nCross Country\nAt the London College's league\non Wednesday. I.C. had some\nbad luck when Norman Morrison\nhad to drop out due to a sprained\nankle, and had to be content with\nsecond place to Borough Road.\nNick Barton, running very well\nrecently, won the race and was\nwell supported by the rest of the\nI.C. team.\nTragic loss\nfor\nSoccer 1st XI\nL.S.E.2: I.C.1I. C.l \u00abt lost their second game\nof the season against L.S.E. last\nWednesday by 2 goals to 1. They\nwere unfortunate as this was one\nof their best performances of the\nseason, I.C., being in complete\ncommand for 80 per cent of the\ngame ; but somehow goals did not\ncome. They were leading 1-0,\nafter a goal by Whittle, but with\nonly 15 minutes left to play\nL.S.E. got two breakaway goals\ncompletely against the run of\nplay. This only put revengeful\ndetermination into the I.C. side\nand tremendous pressure was put\non the L.S.E. defence for the last\nfive minutes; but unfortunately\nthe result stood.\nTo round off the day in typically inconsistent I.C. fashion,\nI.C. VPs lost 6\u20143 against L.S.E. IV and the VII team beat L.S.E. Ill 4\u20142. The second team went\nto the top of the divisions with a good 5\u20141 defeat of Q.M. C. and\nremain unbeaten* in league\nmatches this season. l.C. Fourth\nteam beat Q.M. C.

E.M.I. C.1st XI were in a fairly confident mood for their 1st round match\nagainst Woolwich Polytechnic whose rugby prowess was a little of\nan unknown quantity. Woolwich arrived late which upset I.C. and\nthey showed this by going out and playing hard straight from the\nwhistle\u2014a little unusual for I.C. Woolwich seemed to be holding\nout quite well but after a few minutes some slack tackling let Pine\nin for a try. I.C. then got comfortably on top scoring three more\ntries in the 1st half, the score being 16-0 at half time.\nIn the second half I.C. were This try spree would not of\nslow to get into top gear but after course have been possible but for\nabout ten minutes the T.C. backs\nmade excellent use of a good\nball from the forwards and\nstarted to run in the tries.

It was a cold, foggy day\nand the weather must have inspired the play for the game was\ndull and unimaginative. There\nwas no score on either side.\nSaturday, 11th November, was\nan equally bleak day for the 1st XI.

The two narrators are a major problem but by\nreacting with the populace they\nbecome part of the play, though\nthe First Voice appears to in-trude. In order to portray all the\nsixty-odd parts, each actor plays\nseveral parts and identifies with\neach by his clothing. He also\nimplies his own surroundings.

C.v King's College London, does\nnot hold a very real interest for\na large number of I.C. students,\nand don't let it be said that Felix\nisn't one of the few places in the\ncollege that really knows what's going on. It's just that it's a dull\nweek when your intrepid Felix\nreporter sets off towards Strand\nunderground, forking out nonrefundable expenses to report on\nthe debate.\nTo start from the beginning, it\nwas sometime last Thursday that\nyour intrepid reporter made his\nway up to the third floor of the\nUnion building to see what exciting and dangerous assignment\nwould tax his rather limited\ntalents for this issue.\nOn entering the press-room I was met by clouds of cheap\ncigarette smoke from the Felix\nfags, and after clearing away\nabout a dozen empty beer-mugs,\na few ink-cans, and an ash-tray\nfull of 9d.b i rosI sat down on top\nof a typewriter.\nHierarchy\nTrevor Lucas\nI looked round among the\ncoughing figures who get their\nnames in big type in the credits\nof each issue (I don't want to be\nfeatures editor, anyway), and\nasked if there was anything they\nwanted me to cover, but it appeared my work hadn't* been too\nloudly applauded lately, and they\nwere almost on the point of making me buy my own film for the\nFelix camera. But after I threatened to use another few hundred\nyards of Felix film on more or\nless useless shots of the type I WIN\nDEBATE\nhad been taking for the first half\nof the term, I was eventually\nassigned to cover the grand debating contest mentioned above.\nI arrived at King's College only\n1J hours after the debate had\nbegun (not bud for Felix), or if\nyou care to put it another way, 15\nminutes before the debate ended.\nNevertheless the report was com-ple ted, thanks to the efforts of the\nsecretary of the Debating Society.\nDebate\nIt appears that the I.C. debating team met at King's College\nfor the first round of the UL U debating competition. We were\nopposing the motion. \"This house\nbelieves that this is the best of all\nworlds,\" This was defined by\nKing's as meaning that our world\nis better than any there has been\nin the past, but they specifically\nexcluded the future, an interpretation of the motion with which\nwe did not agree.\nTheir claims that the world is\nmore human was tested to the\nlimit by our team, brilliantly led\nby D. Bennet. who po in fK S out\nthat never before had there been\nso much famine in the world.\nUnfortunately King's team, led\nby Mr. Massen, put their case in\na very lucid, if somewhat verbose\nstv le, and in this kind of competition, unlike Union debates, it\nis not what is said, but the way it\nis said that counts. Because of\nthis the three judges, one from\neach of TC. K.C.L. and U.L. U., had no choice but to let King's College through to the next\nround. So much for our past\nglories, and a great pity that two\nsuch good teams had to meet at\nsuch an early stage in the competition. SEX AT\nSIL WOOD As notices around, the college\nwill tell you Touchstone stands\nfor values. The values discussed\na fortnight ago by about twenty\npeople at the I.C. field station at\nSilwood Park were \" Sex Problems and Solutions\" ; the discussion was led by Dr. W. Greencross, a leading gynaecologist.\nShe opened her lecture, which\nwas particularly informal, by\nsuggesting that a good alternative\ntitle could have been \" The permissive society,\" and she indicated the problems that arise as\na result. Her lecture then became a controlled dialogue with\nthe audience. She quoted facts\nand figures, explaining that one\nin six children born in London\nis \" illegitimate\" and then outlined the social problems that\nsuch children encounter, particularly the social stigma that becomes attached.\nThe group then broke into discussion on our attitudes toward\npre-marital sex and generally it\nwas agreed that a mature relationship needed care and responsibility. The question of contraceptive advice in schools was dis-cussed. Dr. Greenwood showed\nthat in practice many marriages\nwere lacking in communication,\nand the idea of increasing the age\nof marriage was proposed, but it\nwas generally agreed that further\nrestrictions were On personal\nliberties and must be avoided\nalthough many marriages are far\nfrom satisfactory.\nThe success of the weekend\nwas indicated by the reluctance\nof the audience to end the discussions and ran over the set time\nby one and a half hours\u2014finally\nthe weekend was summarised\nDr. Greenwood.\nEnd of\nPsychedelia\nThe Secretary of Ents. Mike\nSmith, resigned a fortnight ago\nbecause of pressure of work.\nThere was no personality clash\nbetween him and chairman Keith\nGuy, as has been rumoured. It\nwas just that the work was too\ndemanding on his time. The new\nsecretary is Gordon Sage, who\nhad only recently been appointed\nas st. secretary to take some of\nthe burden off the retiring secretary. GREEN ON\nAVANT GARDE Benny Green, jazz critic for\nthe Observer, delivered his second\nlecture this term fat his usual\nfast moving, witty style. He was\napplauded as he entered the lecture theatre, and he was applauded as he sat down after a lull sixty minutes of jazz, jazz\ntalk, and more jazz jokes.\nSims\nEverything seemed as normal,\nthis being the seventh lecture\nGreen has given at I.C. in the last\ntwo years. I say \" seemed as\nnormal\" because one could discern evidence to corroborate\nDavid Illingworth's comment in\nthe current issue of \" Jazz Journal\", where talking about Green's programme notes for the jazz\nExpo '67 concerts, he says \" . . .\nhis (Green's) columns of condescension on the avant-garde\u2014\nwhich we all know he hates ! Or\nare the winds of change blow-ing?\" I failed to detect a wind\nbut there was certainly a breeze\napparent on Tuesday, for Green\ndescribed Zoot Sims' multi-track\nrecordings as \" musically worthwhile \" and even went as far as\nplaying an example of Sims'\nwork. Last year he wouldn't have\ndreamed of including that sort of\njazz alongside Ellington, Herman\nand Getz.\nParker\nCertainly Sims is not avant-garde but he is of a later vintage\nthan Charlie Parker, that celebrated saxophonist whose recordings Mr. Green previously\nseemed to consider the end of the\njazz era.\nPerhaps Mr. Green has talked\nhimself into a corner and is now,\nfinding that there is something to\nbe said for contemporary jazz,\nslowly trying to extricate himself.\nThe first avant-garde recordings\nmust have seemed like the ramblings of idiots, a big confidence\ntrick, and would have been easy\nto dismiss as such, but as moi\u00bb\nand more well known jazz musicians have taken up this form\n(Coltrane was the best example)\nit becomes increasingly difficult to\nput it down so glibly.\nWhat will be really interesting\nis the final lecture in two weeks\ntime when Mr. Green promises to\nbring along some examples of\navant-garde for what he described\nas a\" frank discussion \"; perhaps\nwe should issue a gale warning\nfor Mech. Eng.\nDOWN UNDER FOLK\nLast Wednesday, 22nd November. Folk Club featured as their\nguest artist Trevor Lucas, who\ncomes from Australia. He has\nbeen in this country for three\nyears, and sine - a variety of folk-songs, including of course many\nfrom Australia. He is unfortunately giving UD professional folk-singing at Christmas to join a pop\ngroup!\nHe sani a variety of songs from\nall over the world, the majority\nof which had not been heard at\nFolk Club before, which was a refreshing ch gn j re. He rl is pell pH the rumour that \" The black veP!\nvet band \" is Irish; it is in fact\nAustralian. He also sang ac aly p so-style song from the Carribean,\n\" Joshua gone Barbados,\" which\nmade an unusual change. An\nEnglish song, \"The mole-catcher,\"\nwent down well with the audi-en ce, as did a song about a dog,\nand a tucker box five miles from\nGundergee.\nAs usual the guest was well\nsupported by College performers.\nThey were of the usual high,\nstandard but it was a pity that the\nfirst hour was spoiled by people\narriving late. The next Folk\nClub is on December 6th, featuring the \"Young Tradition.\"\nThey have appeared at Folk Club\nbefore and also at the folk c<%v cert at the Albert Hall.\nWELLS SOC2000 At the third meeting of the IC\n2000 Group the speaker was Lord\nRitchie-Calder, on \"The Problems of Technology in 2000\nA.D.\" He began his speech by emphasizing the tremendous speed with\nwhich Technology has advanced\nin the last 60 years. 100 years\nelapsed between the idea of the\naeroplane and the first aeroplane\nleaving the ground but it was only\nsix years after the discovery of\nuranium that we had the nuclear\nbomb.\nLord Ritchie-Calder was very\nsceptical about the ultimate value\nof space research, saying that it\nwas turning the brains of technology away from the problems of\nthe world.\nThe competing nations spend\neight billion dollars a year on\nspace research in the hope of getting a man on the moon'by 1970.\nHe then turned to B:o chemical Research. After what happened\nwith the \" Bomb \" he was full of\nforeboding. Work is going on at\na fantastic rate in the \"defence\nlaboratories \" preparing for biological warfare vd man v Vople\nare winn in\" Nobel Prizes in this\nHe thought that the or ob( ern<! of 2 000 AD were\ngoing to be technological but\nsocial and philosophical. After\nCuba there would never be a nuclear war by act of policy, but\nthere could be one by a technological mistake.\nTwo of the greatest problems in\n2,000 A.D. were going to be\npopulation-growth and food. For\nthis, he had two suggestions. One\nwas the domestication of sea animals and the setting up c$ sea\nfarms, the other was the de vel ment of single-cell proteins.\nWe have not had any philosopher to study the implications\nof scientific research since Bertrand Russell, and he is 93. The\ntrouble is that no-one can call the\nscientists' bluff because science is\nso social is ed. Each group of\nspecialists is going ahead along its\nown road, and there is no-one\nwho can see all the roads at once.\nRACE RELATIONS The second teach-in organised\nby the Political Societies Council\n(in conjunction with the International Relations Club) heard\nPatrick Wall, Jocelyn Barrow (of\nCARD) and John Lyttle talk on\nrace relations. It was gratifying\nto see that we are humanitarians\nfor there was attendance of approximately 80 at this meeting.\nFirst, to give a few facts\ngleaned on this informative evening : there are now about one\nmillion coloured people on this\nisland. Half of these come from\nthe West Indies, and of the others,\nthe sub-continentals predominate,\nmost having come in the late\nfifties and early sixties. Of the\nnatives of this country, 10 per\ncent are said to favour immigration from the Commonwealth, 20\nper cent are against and 70 per\ncent just don't know.\nMrs. Barrow seemed bitter\nabout the fact that to convince\nthe populus of this country of the\nexistence of a large amount of\ndiscrimination, a huge sum of\nmoney had to be spent in producing the P.E.P. report when the\nsame results, produced by CARD two years ago went unheeded.\nMr. Wall was very happy that\nthe two major parties were agreed\non (i) the necessity to limit the\nnumber of immigrants, and (ii) to\nsee that in the future \" Britishborn coloured immigrants \" received equal treatment.

Technical\n^support staff bring the total\nstrength to thirty-five thousand.\nThere is plant, machinery and\nequipment of almost every kind\nknown to nuclear work, including the largest computer service\nin Europe.\nAUTONOMOUS GROUPS The Authority is organised in\nrelatively autonomous groups-Research, Weapons, Reactor,\nProduction and Engineering.\nThere are often no hard and fast\nbund aries between the fields of\noperation of different groups.\nResearch is carried out in\nmany different fields, from Nuclear Physics to Health Physics\nand Medicine. Within the Research Group, the Atomic\nEnergy Research Establishment\nat Harwell does some applied re-search, but by far the greater\npart of its research work is basic\nresearch: some pure research is\nalso undertaken.\nRESEARCH8 c WEAPONS Most of the research is done\nby the Research and Weapons\nGroups. It is aimed at supplying the background of scientific\nknowledge needs for development and appraisal of new reactor systems.\nThe Weapons Group is in.\n:\nvol ved with the research and development of weapons and the\nextension of these into the civil\nfield. The equipment, facilities\nand experience are now used extensively in many fields other\nthan that of weapons. The\nGroup's computing centre at\nAldermaston has probably the\nmost powerful complex in the\ncountry.\nThe Reactor Group is responsible for most of the Authority's design and development work on\nnuclear reactors. The Authority\nhas two Power producing reactors and twenty research and\nexperimental reactors in opera-tion.\nREACTORS The Production Group is responsible for the actual operation\nof the Authority's Power Reactors, the manufacture and sale\nof fuel elements at home and\noverseas, and the subsequent reprocessing of irradiated elements.\nIt includes Engineering, Technical, Chemical Services and\nHealth, Physics and Safety Departments.\nENGINEERS The Engineering Group is re-spp on sib le for the design and development of chemical plans and\nfuel manufacturing plants, and\nelectrical and instrument design\nand supply and inspection services for the whole Authority.\nLastly, the Health and Safety\nBranch study Reactor Safety,\nCriticality, Radiation Dosimetry.\nFallout, Aquatic Radiobiology\nand Chelating Agents, chemical\nmeans of removing radioactivity\nfrom the body.\nSCIENTISTS\nThere are opportunities for\nPhysicists, Chemists, Chemical.\nMechanical, Electrical and Civil\nEngineers, Mathematical and\nMetallurgists.\nCAREERS There are four main categories\ninto which graduates are recruited : Scientific Officer Class,\nExperimental Officer Class, Professional Classes and Graduate\nApprentice.\nA good honours degree is required for entry as a Scientific\nOfficer. These staff initiate,\ndirect and evaluate research.\nSalaries start at about \u00a31.000 and\nrise to abo it \u00a32,300\u2014\u00a33,000 and\nhigher for those who rise beyond\nPrincipal Scientific Officers.\nThe Experimental Officer\nClass, who need a pass degree (or\nH.

Their\nfunction is to carry out most of\nthe experimental work of the\nAuthority.\nThe work of scientists and engineers in the Professional\nClasses covers a range of activities including the design, con-struct ion, operation, performance\nevaluation and development of\nthe Authority's chemical and engineering plant, reactors and\nother facilities. Any necessary\nmanagement training is given.\nStarting salary is from \u00a31,000\u2014\n\u00a31,200, with prospects of about\n\u00a32,700\u2014\u00a33,300.\nGraduate Apprenticeships last\nup to two years.

    "content": "FELIX\nThe opinions expressed\nby correspondents\n;\nare not necessarily\nthot* held by the editor. Blood SweatingSir the Solution ?\nTurn coats\nFelix\nSir,\nDespite the apparent 46.6 per\ncent I.C. content of the UL U Debating Tournament audience, the\nI.C. team were surprised that\nKing's College block vote managed to account for 60 per cent of\nthe final count. Was it by strange\ncoincidence that 6.6 per cent was\nthe exact preponderance of Felix\nreporters in the audience? In the\nface of the massed forces of\nKing's College, was a fifth column\nrevealed? We have his name.\nYours sincerely,\nDENYS BENNETT Pies. Debates\nI would like to make generally\nknown the good response within\nI.C. to the recent appeals for\nblood donors. At last week's sessions 433 donations were made\nby members of I.C. and the usual\ncontingent of museum staff.\nThis figure compares most\nfavourably with last session's total of 479 when one considers\nthe 152 (and still increasing) hall\nresidents now enrolled with the\nemergency do ning unit. Response\nto this scheme in the Halls has\nbeen particularly encouraging\nand already at least 35 pints have\nbeen given through the scheme.\nA lot more will be required by\nthe National Heart Hospital to\naid during the serious shortage of blood which will occur in\nearly December. So still more\ndonors are required.\nI want to thank Tim Burley\nand his helpers for their most\nefficient organisation of tbe regular do ning service.\nCOL CUT T Next year is vital to the-interests of our community. Because we\nknow that you are worried, too, about the increasing dangers to our\nsociety, we are sure that you will accept the tenets of this manifesto.\n\"We must change things\" say most people and then go away\nand forget about it. \" We.don't want to change too drastically \" say\nthe rest: \"It should be a slow process.\" Slow but steady\u2014and\nusually non-existent.\nYou all know things that annoy you about I.C., things that could\nbe changed but haven't been because you couldn't be bothered. You're\nonly here for about three years, most of you, and by the time you\ncan do anything, it's too late. People in the future, like you, will\nsuffer through this attitude.\nBasically we want to bring I.C.'s top-heavy union down to earth\nto its grass roots. Essentially this consists of involving everybody in\ndecisions of any importance to students here. The year rep system\nwhich droops so sadly in many parts of the college will be upgraded\nas an I.C. rather than constituent college organisation. These year\nreps will represent their years on a council which have the power to\ntake policy decisions. The views which reps, put forward will be those\nof their years, decided at twice-termly year meetings chaired by the\nrep.\nThis system will effectively take over much of the power exercised\nat present within the I.C. student body. The floor of the union will\nremain the dominant body but policies, as such, cannot be formed\nthere : the ideas must be thought out outside. The executive will be\nlose much of its present powers, gained to a large degree through the\ntacit acceptance by_ council of its authority. The executive will be\nreduced to taking decisions which need to be taken in a hurry.\nCouncil will be the body which will lose most as its present size\napproximates most closely to the new reps council size. Council, as\nit stands at present, will become the Union's financial advisory committee and no more.\nThe number of clubs within I.C. will certainly be savagely cut\u2014\nthis applies particularly to the social clubs which continue to proliferate as long as Britain makes colonies independent and as long as\nGeorge Harrison finds new ways of praying. Many clubs are being\nsub sidi sed for very few active members and the onus should.be on\nthe clubs to show that they are providing facilities which are sufficiently\nrequired.\nThe constituent college unions will be removed from the rule\nbook and their activities integrated within I.C. union. There is no need\nto maintain the present splits between the wrest ers of mineral wealth,\nthe pure ones, the crude ones. People will be active in what cOmes their\nmay and Mackman, Wells, and O 'Donnell would have been active in\nICU, had not their own colleges existed. Academic affairs do not need\na college to run the rm As RCS experience shows, these things are\nbest done on a primarily departmental basis. The sports activities will\nbe covered by I.C. because, it is confidently expected, those who\norganise in the colleges will move over into the I.C. fold.\nFinally the executive would he completely elected by a ballot of\nall I.C. students. It would remain at a size of six. The executive\nshould need to put themselves over to the student body because it is\nthe students they are representing. They do not at present put\nthemselves over because they do not need to do so. It \"is\na fallacy to belive that a self-perpetuating hierarchy is the best way of\nbeing governed. It has a habit of corrupting itself. The executive\nshould have opinions which it should be pushing at every opportunity.\nThis must be done fast; we believe in democracy and you must elect\nus to carry out this revolution. We need a palace revolution; if it is\n.done slowly the same bureaucrats will continue to run a different\nbureaucracy. A bureaucracy is impersonal and so only if we do it\nfast, will people become interested enough to carry it right to the heart\nof I.C. \u2014YOU.\nSir,\nJudging by the articles in Felix\nre. \" Sweat-in\" etc. some dissatisfaction is obviously felt over\nthe S. S. heating system. As my\nfather was responsible for the\ndesign and installation of the heating system I feel I am duty bound\nto defend it if possible.\nThe problem seems to be that\nwhile the Penthouse is too cold\nthe other rooms are too hot. The\nsystem is arranged in several\nparallel circuits; hot water is\npumped from the basement junction with the main boiler house\nup the building and returns via\na cooler downward pipe. On each\nlanding a tapping is made from\nthe hot pipe and water flows\nthrough the finned heating pipes\nto the return pipe. On each\nparallel line there is a valve which\nregulates the flow. Thus if the\nvalve for any one line is open too\nwide this line will receive too\nmuch hot water at the expense of\nthe rest of the system.\nThe problem is to balance each\nline with respect to all the others.\nThe lower landings will probably\nneed a smaller flow because the\nwater is marginally hotter there.\nAlternatively the upper rooms in\nany stair well will be hotter since\nhot air will funnel up the stair\nwells, this can be restricted by\nkeeping the landing doors closed.\nOnce the system has been ba-lanced, i.e. all levels are at the\nsame temperature, the overall\ntemperature an be regulated by\nadjusting the flow temperature.\nThis can be achieved at the main\nboilers which supply the whole\ncollege. Obviously one cannot\nchange the temperature of the\nwhole college for the benefit of\nS. S. so temperature regulation\ncan be achieved by regulating the\nflow into the S. S. building simply\nby changing the outlet valve\nsetting.'\nThe system worked initially,\nbut has become unbalanced either\ndue to furring of pipes etc. or\nsomebody altering the valves\nThe whole lot should be reset.\nI hope this has given some ammunition with which to bombard\nthe appropriate authority. If\nanybody requires more detailed\nfacts in order to get something\ndone please contact me.\nD.S. SWEATING\nSecurity\nSir,\nI have just been reading your\narticle on the Security of the\nImperial College, and I should\nlike to know your informant on\nthis subject. So the weakest part\nof the system is the men them-selves. Thank you!\nMaybe you would like to work\n27 days a month for a basic wage\nof \u00a312 5s. Od. and have to work at\nall holiday periods.\nSo our ages are over 50 and we\nare lame, cripples, and only come\nhere for the sole purpose of putting stamps on our cards. Rubbish.\nMaybe one of your staff would\nlike to spend Christmas with us\nand pound round these buildings,\nwhilst every one else is at home\nwith their families.\nAt a time when there is unemployment is it not strange that\nwe are understaffed and have to\nbe grateful for any type of person.\nI should like to know which\nbuilding does only a two hour\npatrol? I shall be looking for a transfer, I must be in the wrong\njob.\nYour article is most disappointing and your informant is a clown or a comedian; come along\nand do a13 hour to 15 hour shift\nwith me and see if you are able to\ngo out the next day and do another job.\nI was always under the impression that I lived in a free country\nand Freedom of speech, and especially Freedom of the Press was\none of our greatest assets. Who\nthen put the MUZZLE on Felix'}\nYours truly\nJ. A. PARRY\nEd.: The article that appeared in\nthe last issue of Felix.was not, as\nMr. Parry seems to suppose, an\neffort to denigrate members of the\nSecurity guard, but an attempt to\npoint out, as accurately as pos-sib le, inadequacies that Felix sees\nin the Security System of bu ii u in gs that include our Union. Facts and\nopinions that were printed about\ntheir job were obtained from the\nguards themselves, and it is undeniable that if a man is employed as as ecu it y guard because \" he is\nphysically able to do only light\njobs,\" then the security will suffer by not having a more able\nman. To employ such men is\npresumably a college policy decision and as such cannot reflect\nupon the men employed. Felix\ndoes not so much question the\nperformance of the men them-selves, as the policy that encourages these men to be em-ploy ed. In Unilever,\nmanagement is more\nthan a career...\n... it has acquired the status of a profession and, as such, requires\nhighly developed skills - skills that are never found ready made. For this\nreason we have evolved a comprehensive system of management training and\ndevelopment for young men and women of outstanding calibre.\nUnilever is the sixth largest company in the world, with about 300,000\nemployees in 80 countries. We make and sell consumer products which are\nhousehold names and produce raw and manufactured materials for other\nindustries.\nA high proportion of the management of this widely diversified company-are graduates. For 40 years we have been systematically recruiting students\nfrom Universities.\nChallenging Opportunities for Scientists and Arts Graduates In Unilever, we do not simply accept change, we play a large part in\ncreating it. Keeping the company in the forefront of its field means many\nintellectually exacting and satisfying jobs for scientists and technologists,\nfor economists, mathematicians, sociologists and all types of Arts graduates.\nNo matter what your discipline at University, you have a wide choice of\ncareer in Unilever. A physicist might well turn to Market Research. Or a Zoologist to running a factory. The direction you take is largely up to you.\nIf you are interested in a career in Unilever, our booklet on the Unilever\nCompanies' Management Development Scheme gives simply and factually\nmuch of the information you will require - the structure of the Company,\nprospects, how training is carried out and an indication of some of the things\nyou might find yourself doing if you joined. It also contains details of the\nselection procedure and how to apply.\nIfyou would like to know more about the U.C. M.D.S., and about\nUnilever, ask your Appointments Officer for our booklet,\n\"Careers in Unilever 1968\", or write to: CR. Stewart, Personnel Division,\nUnilever House, London, E.C.4.<A manager from Unilever will be visiting your University during the\nSpring Term to interview students. Details of bis visit can be had\nfrom your Appointments Officer.\n\n"

Two years later the Society produced a Broadsheet, the then Editor writing:\n\"T shall be. delighted to have letters or articles from anyone who feels s tim late d to\nproduce them, so that if the response is sufficient another issue of Scrutiny may be\nproduced.\" Apparently the response was sufficient and so Scrutiny was launched. Two years\nlater it was taken over by the Social Clubs Committee and expanded as a general magazine,\nappearing termly. \"Writers have always included members of staff and officers of the Unionas well as members and associates of S. C.C. However, Scrutiny never sold above 800, and since' it began to be professionally\nprinted^ in 1963> it always needed about twenty pounds subsidy per issue, lately there lias\nbeen no enthusiastic band willing to produce the magazine, the last two issues being\nedited by chairmen of S. C.C. This term's issue was made up of material intended for last\nterm's, which did not appear. An S. C.C. motion to wind up Scrutiny was passed last term.\nSTUDENT LIFE\nFELIX Advertising Agents have recently published the first issue of a new student\nnewspaper which is to appear four times a year. Printed in colour, \"Student Life\" is\nprofessionally produced and edited by an ex-editor of \"Redbrick\", the student newspaper of\nBirmingham University.\nThe publishers, Educational Publicity, say that the purpose of the paper is twofold-firstly to give a student orientated paper of national status but with no political\naffiliations, and secondly to attract \"careers advertising\" away from the nationals to the\nstudent press.\nNEnTHEMK\nNewthink, the 1st issue of which appeared last week is produced by a group of people\nfrom several universities who fe lb there was a need for a magazine \"to encourage an active\nattitude among young people -and promote discussion of problems at their roots.\" The\nprinting, by offset litho, was done in Wolverhampton, the money (\u00a360) being put up mainly\nby the three editors. If they sell out they v dll make \u00a315 which will go towards the next\nissue. 1000 were printed, of which 120 were sold in IC.

    "content": "4 FELIX\nf\\ EDITOR'S Lromment\nFor Student Loans\nMuch is said in student circles about the rig ours of a system of\nloans to replace or supplement our present grants, but little or nothing\nis said in defence of loans. Could it be there is no defence, or is it\nthat the case for loans is so clearly reasonable to everyone except us\nthat for our own peace of mind we choose to ignore it?\nWhereas on a personal level I am quite happy with the present\nsystem, which educates me virtually free and then allows me to emigrate or do just as I please, seen from the point of view of the\nGovernment, as representative of the British people, we are not being\neducated as of right, or out of love; nor does the Government give it us\nfree exclusively to keep them in power at the next election! We\nare being educated at the State's expense as a loan; so that when we've\nfinished we will be of greater use to the country and so repay the\ncountry's investment. In return for this we have the satisfaction of\nan education and a greater range of jobs available for those with\nsuitably trained minds.\nIf then on graduation a significant proportion of the country's youth leaves for greener pastures, the Government is saddled with an\nunpaid debt which, under the present system, they have little hope of\nrecovering. To offset this loss, which at present we as a country\ncannot afford, it seems reasonable that the Government should say\nthat our grant is in fact a loan that must be repaid either in money or\nman hours of work, and that if we leave the country within say eight\nyears of graduation then we must pay back a proportion of our loan.\nAlternatively a system of loans that was being suggested last year\nthat also seems eminently reasonable is that there should be available\nadditions to the present grants, which should be in the form of a loan.\nAs the current living allowance is, in almost all cases, perfectly\nadequate, that any addition should be repayable is not an undue\nimposition.\nHowever, whatever action may be taken in the future towards\nintroducing loans, let us at least approach the suggestions with an open\nmind\u2014considering that on a national level they may be reasonable.\nFurther should we decide (or should I say \" when we decide \") to\nprotest against them, let's do it in a responsible way.\nTo lobby M.P.'s, as individuals, and as a body, through the\npresident of the Union, would carry much more weight than to stage\nboycotts of lectures\u2014not, surely, dignified behaviour for the future\nprofessional man.\nSabbatical Year for Sennet Editor ?\nYet again Sennet is in financial difficulties \u2014yet again it is faced\nwith a number of staff resignations and statements of disillusionment.\nLast time this happened, the Sennet Board took the logical step of\ncancelling the charge of 4d. in the hope that the increased readership\nwould attract more advertising and so make the paper pay. This\ntime though they have acted with what can only be viewed as complete\nincompetence. To cancel one issue at a week's notice may well\nrepel potential advertisers and to reduce photographs to the level of\nthe issue of 14th November demotes the paper to the level of a third-rate news letter.\nA unit as large and diverse as the University of London needs\nan informed and outspoken press. It will only achieve this if it has\nan assured income and a staff with time to put in the necessary work.\nBoth of these may be achieved by installing an editor with a sabbatical\nyear. This move would have many advantages, amongst which are\nfirstly, that he would have time to find advertising through his own\nefforts to supplement that provided by the agency; secondly, he would\nhave time to make personal contact with colleges within U.L. U. and\nso positively get news as opposed to the present system which, judging\nby the results, simply allows the news to drift in; thirdly, for the rest\nof the staff, producing the paper could re-assume its proper proportions as a hobby instead of a\" millstone;\" and,finally,the paper\nwould have a constant annual character through being assured of a good editor\u2014I feel that many good people would be willing to do the\njob if their degree was not at stake.\nThe opinions expressed in this\ncolumn are those of Roderick J. Redmayne,\u2014not necessarily of\nImperial College Union.\nF m^IX Imperial College\nLondon, S.W.7 Internal 2881\nTel. KEN 2963\nEditor : RORY REDMAYNE\nAsst.

A.; photographed while talking\nto John Mullalv recently\nWHITHER ICWA ?\nWhither ICWA ? or without it ? Will it nourish ? or not ? Will\nIcwarians come to hive at Southside ? Will there be an ICWA at\nall ? Or just a Lady Vice-President ? Will there still be Executive\nPancake Races ? Will Snoopy get the Red Baron ?\nFor the answer to most of these questions, Felix padded up to\nthe top of Beit Hall to speak to the present ICWA President, Jane\nPearson.\nPerhaps this is the right place for the President's potted profile.\nJane Pearson came to IC from Bishop Fox's Grammar School for\ngirls (on her head mistress's advice) and\u2014doubtless a dyed-in-the wool Tory\u2014became chairman of the Conservative Society. In the\nsame year she was ICWA's junior treasurer. This year she has\ntaken up the post of President of ICWA just in time to be involved\nin discussions of its possible demise.\nRepresentation\nThis is not to say ICWA will\nnecessarily be abolished in the\nnext five or ten or more years:\nonly that it is possible. It has\nbeen noised abroad the Union\nthat there is no need for ICWA;\nthat if the ICwomen want student\nrepresentation they should stand\nfor it in the normal manner, and\nnot take up posts allotted to them:\nthat, in short, ICWA should be\ndone away with. If men can look\nafter themselves without an\nICmen's association (or is IC just\none vast men's association with a few exceptions here and there)\nthen why not women ? Perhaps\nthe most un j x&ia al consideration\nhere is what lew arians think\nabout the matter, leaving aside for\nthe moment the extremist views\nof those who \" hate ICWA\u2014it's an institution,\" or those who\nspend their time peeking into\nDesolation Row from the ICWA\nlounge ; what does Jane Pearson\nthink about it ?\nSuccess by Suicide\nFirst, that ICWA is still necessary, and that it will continue to\nbe so until IC has at least twice\nas many Icwarians as it has now\n(at present there are 230). Second, that even if ICWA were\nabolished there would still be a need for a Lady Vice-President of\nIC to represent female interests.\nLast, and almost certainly least,\nwhere would female competition in the Executive Pancake\nRace come from if not, as t radi to Southside ?\nt ional, from the upper hierarchy\nof ICWA ? Basically Jane Pearson feels that there will be a need\nfor ICWA for a long time in\norder to look after fresher et tes in\ntheir first few weeks in IC's beer-and-blue-jokes atmosphere, and\nalso to provide a centre for those\ninterests that are exclusively fe-male. Significantly and accurately\nshe adds that \" the success of\nICWA depends on its self-de-struct ion\"; that it would be a good thing for ICWA to permeate\nitself as much as possible\nthroughout IC.\nNext year the plan is for\nICWA to colonise another floor\nof Beit Hall, thus bringing up the\nnumber of Icwarians in Hall from\n22 to 47. What next ? Where\nwill they spread to ? Will they\ntake over a staircase in Southside\nor permeate down to occupy the\nremaining floor of New Beit ?\nJane stresses that the latter is the\nlast thing that Icwarians want as\nit was only a few years ago that\nBeit achieved the distinction of\nbecoming one of the first mixed\nhalls in the country. At present\nIcwarians are not noted for being\ntoo forthcoming about the Union\n(\" it's difficult to be forthcoming\nwhen you've got such a strong lot\nof men \"\n1 and a single sex Beit\ncould on lv tend to make ICWA\nmore introvert. It would be a significant improvement for\ni CW A to branch out and take\nover a mrt of Southside. At present this is only a pipe-dream\nlet us hope that it does not remain so.\nPhoenix on Lon lines s Anyone who believes that I.C. is full of dull, illiterate scientists\nneed only read the next issue of\nPhoenix to be proved wrong.\n\" But,\" a critic might say, \" the sz are only the efforts of a small\ngroup of people numbering\nless than two dozen.\" To this,\neditor Colin Harrison would\nreply that he received so many\ngood articles that he increased\nthe size of the magazine by a half and even cut out his own\neditorial.\nAbout half the articles follow\nthe general theme of loneliness.\nThis problem is approached from\nseveral angles ranging from a philosophical dissertation to a short\nstory. This story, called \" Shadows Fall Between,\" is possibly\nthe high spot of the magazine,\nfor it captures exactly the feeling\nof aimlessness and desire to feel\nwanted when one is lonely. If\nthis is not quite your taste, there\nis an article on \" dropouts \"\u2014\n\u2014people who fail their examinations. It is almost a self-analysis\nby someone who is now on a pass degree course and has some\nharsh things to say about the selection proceed ure. Unlike previous issues, this edition of Phoenix does not offer a free pin-up on the cover, but has\na rather startling drawing which\nwill probably be of more lasting\ninterest. The high standard of\nartistic work is kept up through-out. Phoenix is published on\nMonday, 4th December.\nnew RC C van The RCC has replaced its\nsickeningly inefficient (mechanic-ally!) van with a12 seater Ford\nTransit bus.

He subsequently\nfinished the war as a P.O.W. He then went to sea and returned to J. Lyons and the Trocadero Restaurant in Piccadilly for\nsome 10 years.\nHe joined the College in 1957,\nbeing the first Wine Butler ap-poi ned to the enlarged Union.\nHe was an honorary member of\nChaps, Links and 22 Clubs.\nIt is with great sorrow that\nFelix reports Charlie's death\u2014\nthis cheerful figure will be greatly\nmissed and the competence with\nwhich he led our dining etiquette\nis irreplaceable.\n\n"

In 1933 he was\nmade professor of physics at Birkbeck, where he stayed until elected\nto the Langworthy Professorship of Physics at Manchester in 1937.\nHis work on cosmic rays in this period gained him election to the\nRoyal Society in 1933, the R.S. Medal in 1940 and a Nobel Prize in\n1948.\nCopley Medal\nFourteen years ago Professor\nBlackett came to I.C. as Professor of Physics and Head of the\nPhysics Department. While continuing his work in cosmic rays he\nalso did considerable research in\nthe field of palaeo magnetism for\nwhich he was awarded the Royal\nSociety Copley Medal in 1956.\nDean of R.C.S. from 1954 to\n1963, he also sat on the council of\nthe D. S.I.R. and was chairman of\nthe R.G. C., in a period when a phenomenal growth occurred in\ngrants to university departments\nfor scientific and technological\nresearch.\nFrom 1961 to 1963 Professor\nBlackett was pro-Rector of I.C.' In 1965 he retired, became President of the Royal Society, Companion of Honour, and Senior\nResearch Fellow at I.C. To be appointed to the Order\nof Merit must be the crowning\nglory to a career paved with honours for academic and administrative excellence.\nCarnival Cash City and Guilds in two collections have netted \u00a3319.\nMines in one collection have netted \u00a3181.\nRCS Physics 1 (and others) \u00a3152.\nMaths \u00a323.\nAs Guilds managed to collect \u00a3270 in one afternoon the value of\nturning out in large numbers is obvious.\nGuilds predict that they will collect \u00a31,500 on collections.\nMines estimate \u00a31,000.\nPete Dolwin predicts that Physics alone will collect \u00a32,000.\nChris Palmer reminds all those without pools tickets to collect\nthem from their year reps and thanks all those who helped in counting\nthe money.\nCOLLEGE PARKING PLAN Use of 400\nparking bays\nAmid the more obvious public\npreparations for the introduction\nof a parking meter system in the\nWestminster City area, which includes I JC, the College has now\nmade public its plans for the use\nof the 400 parking bays in College controlled areas, which of\ncourse are not subject to the new\nmeters.\nIn a letter to Ray Phillips, the\nRector, Lord Penney, outlined\nthe system for allocation of bays\nwhich his parking committee had\nput forward and which he had ac-c ep ted. Car users will be split\ninto the following categories\u2014the\ndisabled and resident staff (46\nspaces), departmental vehicles\n(16), visitors to the College (16),\nresident union officers (12), regular staff commuters (200) and students will get 110 spaces, 80 of\nwhich will be for commuters.\n\u00a35 Charge\nTo those who are allotted\nplaces there will be a charge of\n\u00a35 which will ensure that they\nhave a parking bay between\nOctober and June each year.\nThere will also be a second class\nof car sticker, obtained by app li cation, which will allow holders\nto take part in a\" free-for-all\"\nfor the College bays during July,\nAugust and September. As\nmeters are to be introduced\nin January it has been decided\nthat a charge of \u00a33 10s. will be\nmade to bay users for the period\nJanuary to June next year.\nStudents appear to have\nemerged from the meetings of the\nparking committee in a better\nposition than was at first feared. It was being rumoured, for in-stance, around the beginning of\nthe session that the committee\nwould recommend that there\nshould be only 60 places for student cars. On the grounds of\nsheer \"seniority\" and because\nmany of them must live out of\nLondon, because they have fam i lies, the staff are clearly entitled\nto a greater proportion of the\navailable spaces than students\u2014\ntherefore, although some will obviously be hit by these new re-strict ions, students as a body can\nhave little cause for complaint-The closing date for applications for the student bays is 6'th\nDecember when they will be Considered by the Executive plus\nRex Lowen and Bob Fryer. Car\nowners will therefore know by\nChristmas whether there will be\na bay available for them next\nterm.\nEd.: 8 pints of beer plus\n\u00a33 10s. is less than Is. an hour\nfor two terms!\nRafoctprio* and Common Kaonu\nThe proposed College parking areas as outlined in the new plan.\nRCS OPEN DAY FOR SCHOOLGIRLS? Once again the improvement, in terms of balance, of RCS Union\nmeetings was evident at the meeting on October 21st with the agenda\nincluding such diverse items as Frank Fuchs' ideas for attracting more\nwomen to IC and a series of chalk races between prominent members\nof the Union.\nAfter the reading of the minutes, the announcement of Roger\nWebb's appointment as the new secretary and the instigation of a sub-committee to revise the constitution, R.C.S. vented its wrath on\nthe heads of the organisers of the swimming gala, who had allowed it\nto clash with the R.C.S. carnival. There were, as Bob Mackman said,\nstill hopes that the date of the swimming gala would be changed, but\nif this proves impracticable, then it would be moved half an hour\nearlier to allow everyone a short breathing space between the two\nevents. The selection of the Physics Dept. rep followed in which Pete\nDolwin was voted in preference to Chris Craddock.\nThe real meat of the meeting Leading the opposition, jane\nthen came up with Frank Fuchs' Pearson, Martin Lack and Stewmotion to investigate the possibility of holding an R.C.S. open\nday for VI form girls in order to\nencourage more of them to come\nto IC. Frank backed up by\nJeannie Prickett, starting from the\nobvious standpoint that there are\ntoo few girls at IC, argued that\nthe institution of open days would\ngo a long way to correcting the\ndisproportionate ratio. At the\nmoment girls thinking of applying\nto this college are often given a bad impression of the place by\ntheir careers mistresses and headmistresses and open days could\nhope to dispel those ill-founded\nillusions.\nart Barnes hammered home time\nand time again the salient points\nthat the organization of such open\ndays would involve a great\namount of time and money and\nwhat was there to show them any-way? They also said that the\ncollege authorities were doing\ntheir utmost and offered the constructive suggestion that it should\nnot be the girls who were shown\nround the college but their headmistresses and science teachers.\nTeresa Smart, prodded no doubt\nby Jari6 Pearson, attempted to\nmove an amendment to this\neffect, but it was withdrawn after\nfrantic hurried discussions between Mackman, Fuchs and Jane\nPearson, on the ground that it\nwould alter the motion too dras-tic ally. This seems a pity as there\nis no doubt that this would provide the most practical and least\nexpensive solution to the problem.\nMost of the secondary speeches\nwere in favour of the motion,\nand mostly from people who have\nbeen prominent supporters of\nFrank Fuchs in. the past. Th\u00a7\nopposition, too, as Derek Boothman pointed out, seemed to come\nfrom those who have opposed\nFuchs in the past. It will be\nregrettable if RCSU is split into\ntwo opposing factors for the\nwhole year.\nAnyway, after all the w rang ling, the motion was passed by a show of hands and the General\nCommittee will have to investigate the possibilities of these open\ndays.\nChalk\nand noses\nWith the debate over, Malcolm\nDuckett plugged RCS carnival,\nwith films, cabaret, discotheque\nand three groups, including 1984\n(again!). Mike Tait outlined\nplans for RCS charity collections\nind then* he, Martin Lack and\nPete Dolwin indulged in races\nwith pieces of chalk and noses\nalong the length of the lecture\nbench.\nThe meeting then drew to a close with, as ever, a Kang6la.\n\n"

Gliding Club, founded in\nor around 1931, is the second\noldest in the country and can\nclaim to have been in the forefront\nof British gliding ever since.\nFlying takes place at the Lasham\nGliding Centre in Hants, where\nover one-sixth of all British gliding is carried out.\nBack in the early days, the\nclub's first glider was built in the\nMech Eng Department, and was\ntentatively flown anywhere and\neverywhere there was room to\ntake off, have a quick fly and\nland, notably on the playing\nfields of I.C. At that time they were affiliated to the London Gliding Club,\nwhich was a few years their\nsenior, but after the war the London club were unwilling to let\nthem back into the fold except\nat an exorbitant cost, and so\nthey moved to fly with the Surrey\nGliding Club at Redhill, following them to Lasham in 1951.\nPrecarious Training\nBefore two-seat trainers were\ninvented, learning to fly was an\nextremely precarious business.\nThe trainee was strapped firmly\ninto the single-seater and towed\nslowly across the airfield while\nhe tried to keep the wings bal-an ced. When he accomplished\nthis to the satisfaction of his in-struct or, he was towed across the\nairfield again, this time making\nshort hops all the while, then\nlong hops, then even longer hops\nuntil, if both he and the aircraft was still in one piece, he\nwas finally allowed to complete\na whole circuit of the airfield.\nThis method of training was in-efficient, to say the least, so in\n1949 the College bought a Slingsby T21 two-seater trainer and\nthis, in the hands of the organisation at Redhill, helped to\nformulate all of the two-seater\ntraining methods now in exist-en ce. This same machine, now\nin the hands of the Lasham Air\nScouts, and officially named\n\"Daisy,\" has now made the ridiculous figure of nearly 70,000\nflights.\nTwo Gliders\nI. C.G.C. currently owns two\nhigh performance gliders; and\nEagle two-seater trainer and a solo sail plane, the Skylark 4.\nThe I.C. club is one of the few\nclubs in the country that puts\nits two pilots on to the high performance Skylark almost as soon\nas they've gone solo, instead of\nmaking them gradually progress\non to more and more expensive\nmachines.\nRecently, the Skylark was lent\nto the British Gliding Associat e141Sk j M4 fight\ntion in order to further a plan\ncalled Operation Sigm aiming\nto produce the best glider in the\nworld, so that Britain will win the\nthe 1970 World Gliding Championiships. The B.C.A., in turn,\nlent it back to the College Aero\nDepartment, who, under the\nguidance of Mr. Frank Irving,\nwarden of Beit Hall, covered it\nwith all sorts of weird instrumentation in order to develop new\nailerons.\nMembers on BGA\nMr. Irving has in fact, been\nconnected with the club almost\nsince its inception, has been a member of the Technical Committee of the B.G. A. for 12 years\nand is' a consultant to the Slingsby Sailplane Company, this\ncountry's only glider firm, for\nwhom he \" Does the odd sum\nnow and again.\" He is also a co-holder of the British National\ntwo-seater distance record, having flown250 miles from Lasham\nto Lourain, in Belgium, there\nbeing no record of how he got\nthe glider back.\nGliding Club members have\nbeen active in British Gliding\ni or many years. Apart from\nFrank Irving, Mr. Paul Minton,\nwarden of Garden Hall, sits on\nthe Accident Committee of the\nB.G. A., while Bill Bailey, a Civil\nEng. P.O., represents the Lasham\nGliding Centre on the B.G. A. council. The club also ran the\nradio for the British and Irish\nteams in the 1965 world championships at South Cerney in\nGloucester, while Frank Irving\nhas been on the British Ground\nCrew since 1952. George Burton,\nas a result of finishing in the top\nthree in this year's nationals at\nLasham, has been selected to fly\nfor Britain in the 1968 world\nchampionships in Poland. And,\nslightly further down the scale,\nDave West, the club treasurer,\ngained 3rd place in the Southern\nRegion of the Wills competition\nfor novice, glider pilots, winning\nan expensive baro graph for the\nclub.\nInternationalists\nQuotes of the Fortnight\nPatrick Wall MP at IC recently :\n\" English-born coloured immigrants.\"\nMalcolm Duckett at R.C.S. debate \" Because of the lack of\nwomen at I.C., look what I 've ended up marrying.\"\nJeannie Prickett, at R.C.S. debate; on the situation of girls at I.C.\" Too many men\u2014not enough opportunities for women.\"\nMr. ICWA\u2014I'm not here for stud purposes alone.\nMartin Lack\u2014I don't want MY union beaten up.\nEditor\u2014Unlike the Sundays, Felix wants to be an informed news-paper.\nCAR PARKING PLACES110 PLACES AVAILABLE cost 43 10s( from January until the end of June)\nApplications from HALL RESIDENTS and COMMUTERS;\nincluding address, reason for needing a car, etc., to the Union\nOffice by 6th December. Places will be allocated according\nto merit. All applicants will be notified by the end of Term.\nAs well as helping the British\nteams, the club lent their Skylark to the Finns, at South\nCerney in 1965, who prom t ly showed their gratitude by smashing it up. They explained in\nfluent Scandinavian and not-so-fluent English that it was \" one\nof those . . . English stone\nledges.\" However, just to prove\nthat anything the Finns can do\nwe can do better, a nameless I.C. flyer flew the newly-repaired machine backwards into a hoarding\non the club's subsequent visit to\nthe Alps.\nSummer visits to the continent\nare a feature of the club's activities, last year visiting Angers in\nFrance, where the townspeople\nnamed their gliding festival \" Les\nhu it jours d 'Anger,\" perhaps an\nestimate of I.C. G.C.'s ability.\nGliding Weekends\nFrom a social point of view\nI.C. visits to Lasham are every\nbit as enjoyable as the gliding\nactivities. Mike Neal, an ex-president of I.C. Union, owns a cottage near the airfield, where\nthe club members frequently repair to imbibe vast quantities of\nhis potent home-made wine, and\nfly off their hangovers in the\nmorning.\nThe pleasure of gliding is the\nconstant struggle to maintain or\ngain height, to utilise the energy\nstored in the atmosphere in\nthe form of thermals, turbulent\nbubbles of warm, rising air, or\nair currents rising over a hill and\nthe waves of air formed behind\na hill just as a stone forms ripples\nin a stream. Then, as well, there's pleasure in standing around for\nhours in Wellington boots and\nsteady rain, with the cloud base at\na hundred feet, and in being\ntowed into the air by a thoroughly clapped ' American Ford\npick-up to experience the feeling\nof weightlessness as the launch\nends and the cable drops away.\nBut it's comforting to know\nthat the glider can withstand\nmore than 3Jg. before it's liable\nto fall apart, unless its gets flown\nupside down, when the wings\nmay have a slight tendency to\ndrop off. And it's even more\ncomforting to know that one of\nthose magnificent I.C. men in his\ngliding machine knocked 3ft. off\na wing-tip during an argument\nwith a tree, and flew on quite\nsafely without noticing the loss.\nICWA Party\nLast Tuesday, 14th November,\nImperial College was be strewn with slightly inebriated, if not\ndownright drunken, women. Yes\nthe I. C.W. A. sherry party had\nPREGNANCY TEST SERVICE Results by return. Reliable\nmethod. Fee \u00a32.

To get\ninto the main RCS den irt men tv ou must get two era deB's or\nbetter. Assuming 15 ner cent of\nall girls get these ir mr ks, iu*t*r> have a chance of inviting the e irl s that wo'il d< \"Tn? her i** \u00bb \u00ab * \" *\nwould have to invite about 500.\nBeing modest we'll aim for an increase of 30 per cent, and assuming we manage to persuade two-thirds of the invited girls to stay\nwe must bring 1,000 girls, or\nabout thirty coach loads. At 5s. for food on board this makes\n\u00a3250 and 100 guides, a very difficult assignment to carry out.\nKaleidoscope\nAnyway, changing from Politics\nto Entertainments, are you doing\nanything on Friday? Well forget\nit, and come to \" Kaleidoscope,\"\nthe RCS Carnival. This is by far\nthe best social event of the year\nand goes on from 9.00 p.m. to\n6.30 a.m. and at only 30s. double\nit is really very good value,\ntickets available at lunch times\nin Southside and the Union, or\nfrom your year reps.\nKaleidoscope means \" ka los\" or \" beautiful\" and \"eidos,\"\n\"forms,\" thus \"beautiful forms,\"\nso there is no need to worry\nabout the theme, just come\ndressed in anything or nothing, as\nlong as it is coloured.\nCarol Singing\nAfter Kaleidoscope you should\njust have recovered in time to\ngo carol singing on Monday 4th and Wednesday 6th. RCS and\nthe Royal College of Music have\njoined forces for this event. If\nyou. have been carol singing be-fore, forget it; this happening is\ncompletely different so you're\nbound to have a good time, and\nwe should collect \u00a3500 plus for\nthe I.C. Carnival Charity.\nChat with President)\nOn the subject of the President,\nBob says that he will be at home\nin Tizard 422 every lunch time\n(\"dinner hour\" for Mike Tait\nand all sons of the working class),\nand will be pleased to see anyone\nwho likes to come along with\ncomments or complaints, or just\nSimply for a cup of coffee. If you\naren't free at dinner time give him\na ring on internal 3634 (yes, he's got a private phone) any evening.\nFinally, congratulations to Pete\nDolwin for becoming Physics'\ndepartment Rep.\nQUO VADIS\nSTUDENT TRAVEL FOR CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS INFORMAL AND INCLUSIVE\nSTUDENT PARTIES FROM\n\u00a315 PER WEEK TO The\nRussian Winter Art Festival in\nMoscow; attractive Winter Sports\nCentres in Austria and new\nexciting Ski Centres in Eastern\nEurope!

I.CH A0062 GUILD SPOT Carnival\nCollections\nThe big news in Guilds at the\nmoment is the fantastic record-breaking Carnival collection! One\nThursday Lunchtime about 100\nGuildsmen (and Guildswomen)\nwell groomed and well disciplined, set out for the Oxford St.\narea, where, by some coincidence,\na red veteran car was catching the\n\" admiring\" glances of several\n\" men in blue.\" In just over an\nhour the public were relieved of\nover \u00a3270\u2014surely the most efficient Carnival collection ever.\nWell done Guildsmen! The only\nproblem facing Carnival Co-or d in at or Chris Palmer is how to retrieve one Leukaemia collecting\ntin from Cannon Row police\nstation!\nFord Cup\nOn Sunday the Ford Cup for\nGuilds Rugger Sevens was eventually won by Civil 2. In the final,\nwhich was played in semi-dark-ness at best, they beat a strong\nO.C. team for the trophy, which\nCivil 1 won last year. Much\ncredit is due to Terry Stephenson\nand Dick James who organised\nthe event so successfully.\nComing Events\nComing events in Guilds\u2014December 5th is the next Union\nmeeting and December 8th is\nCarnival carol singing night. So\nwatch the Guilds notice bo an ls for details.\nFinally, Dick James has set a target of \u00a31000 to be collected by\nGuilds for Carnival by Christmas\n\u2014and with \u00a3350 already in the\nbag it should be possible.\nSo -rally round Guildsmen\u2014\nlet's have \u00a31,000 by Christmas!\nhappened. ICWarians and their\nguests (invited and uninvited)\nwere enticed to the I. C.W. A. lounge by the promise of free\nsherry and punch which only ran\nout just before 7.30 when half of\nthose present went to dinner. For\nthose ardent drinkers who were\nwH Ii pst to seek out the wine\nwaiter, the drink was to be had in\nprofusion, and as some found to\ntheir cost the punch was more potent than it seemed.\nThis Annual occasion rooted\nout many ICWarians who do not\nusually honour I. C.W. A. functions with their presence. It\nseemed a pity though that\nICWarians would not { bring\nguests. There was a surplus of\nwomen, naturally, very nice for\nthose men invited, but the conversation is lacking if groups of\nwomen stand about gossiping.\nCarnival\nLast week Battersea, Chelsea\nand diverse training colleges held\ntheir rag, and of course they had\nlots of women to help raise money.\nThey even, as lots of London rags\ndo, sent women to Southside to\ncon money out of us! Well in our\ncarnival this year we must follow\nsuit. Whenever collections are to\nbe taken, please, Icwarians,\nvolunteer. Rich business men\nwith lots of money are more\nlikely to part with it to a pretty\nface than to a lot of rowdy yobo s. Anyway it's great fun asking\npeople for money (in the name of\ncharity), so please help in this\nyear's carnival.\n\n"

O.S.S. exists io remove the\nmany subsidiary difficulties which prevent students doing serial work\nIt enables them to grapple dir?ct lv with the real problems without\nhaving to face the minor difficulties which individuals would find\nextremely discouraging, if not insurmountable.\nO.S.S. was set up in 1965. by I.C. students, specifically to as sM all students wanting to do social work regardless of their motivation\nBy design O.S.S. is not a club or a society and has no political,\nreligious, humanist or other doctrinaire policies\u2014in d jed these are\nconsidered to be out of the terms of reference of O.S.S. There is no\nmembership and people are not asked to do things FOR O.S.S. but to\nmake USE of the services it provides. In view of this novel structure\nmodifications were made in S. C.C. standing orders to enable it to\nfunction within the structure of the union.\nBasically, there are three main groups of activity with many\nother smaller or transitory undertakings. It is difficult to keep close\ntrack of what is happening as the situation is moving so fast.\nWork Parties\nWork parties, the largest group,\nwill always have the widest appeal because they can be run on\na \"casual labour\" basis.\nThrough numerous contacts\nO.S.S. obtains jobs of a varied\nnature for almost every weekend\nof the session and students are\nasked to come along only when\nthey wish and to stay only as long\nas is convenient for them. By\nknowing approximate numbers a continuous work force can be\nensured although the individual\nmembers frequently change.\nMany I.C. students like some\nform of physical work with hammer and nail, shovel and saw,\npaint and brush. They find the\nwork strenuous but a welcome\nchange from the academic rig ours of a University course. Some jobs,\nlike the decorating tasks for the\nNotting Hill Housing Trust for\ntask force arc relatively civilised,\nothers have ended up under floodlight and rain manhandling lumps\nof 12 in. x12 in. x15 ft. wood\nthrough mud and debris.\nO.S.S. at present makes tape\nrecordings of text books for many\nblind students to provide them\nwith vocal technical information.\nThis supersedes the former arrangement of reading to blind students in person as it is both more\nproductive and easier.\nO.S.S. established facilities\nwithin the college for the recording of required sections of literature and possesses a tape-recorder\nreserved solely for this purpose.\nIt is always accessible to students\nwishing to make recordings whether it be for a few minutes in a lunch-hour or a whole evening.\nSections of \" Gray's Anatomy \"\nand an \" O\" level Geography\nbook are at present being re-corded.\nSoUtade if yon like on a deco ratio a work\nThe attitudes of deprivation accepted as part of daily life by a typical club member of the adventure playground youth club can\nbe an eye-opener to the average\ninformed student and a useful\nfoot on the ground. No particular\nskills are required but whatever\ntalents you have are very likely\nto be quickly exploited.\nA more serious and long term\naim of the \" Adventure play-ground,\" underlying all the hilarity, is the fitting of the individual\nfor society primarily by providing\nfacilities of which many are deprived and, secondly, by encouraging a sense of communal responsibility. Opportunities exist at a number of clubs for a wide range\nof activities; from toddler mind-ing, through the energetic trials of\nplaying with the 5-12 year olds in\nan adventure playground, to the\nmore demanding youth work with\nteenagers. Also, people are required to be bingo-callers, tea-makers, pianists, listeners, give\nlifts to old-folks, look after pets,\nand so on in a never ending list.\nSome of the youth clubs we\nhelp are the organised type whilst\nothers accept the rejects and present a tough challenge in keeping\norder amidst the necessary \"Non-Organisation.\"\nOther Activities\nA group of students is engaged\non the regular visiting of old folks.\nOpportunities arise for students\nto support charitable organisations by distributing leaflets, collecting money, etc. O.S.S. does\nits best to inform students about\nthese opportunities and, if there\nis sufficient support, organises the\nnecessary facilities.\nThe regular college blood-do ning sessions are promoted by\nO.S.S. and a considerable amount\nof work is involved here.\nBut is it'childproof?\nStructures for the adventure\nplayground\nA new I.C. emergency blood-do ning unit is being set up and\noperated by O.S.S. aimed particularly ai hall residents, it is hoped\nthat as many as possible will\ntransfer to this scheme.\nThe next task is to form an\nO.S.S. emergency mobile labour\nunit to deal with the emergencies\nwhich periodically arise in certain\nareas of London\u2014jobs like moving an evicted family off the\nstreet.\nU.C. and Q.E. C. both have\nstudents doing similar work and\nLondon seems to be leading the\nway in this type of work organised\nsolely by students.\nLondon University is now attempting to set up a council for\nsocial services and it is hoped\nthat this will come into operation\nnext session. Much could be\nachieved by the inter-college co-operations which it will foster.\nO.S.S. basically exists to get\nthings done\u2014The talking is left\nto others. If you want to find out whether you would enjoy social\nwork come along and find out.\nBut be warned\u2014most people who\ntake up social work don't want to\nstop.\n\n"

Now is the time for those\nwho are interested to begin to\ntake part in this development.\nThat there is a shortage of\npeople to fill the positions which\nare going to become available in\nthe senior range can be seen from\nthe much-bemoaned lack of computer personnel at present seen\nin all levels. The programmers\nof to-day are the leaders of to-morrow. And the shortage today\ncan be gauged from the salaries\npaid to newly-trained programmers (the good and the bad\nalike), and the fact that any\nreasonable programmer or systems programmer can probably\nup his salary by over \u00a3200 a year\nsimply by changing firms. It is a fact that between the ages of 20\nand 30 systems analysts rank\namong the highest paid categories of professional and executive staff. The foregoing should\nbe sufficient to point out the need\nfor people, and in the coming\nyears the ability and experience\nof the individual is going to become of appropriately greater\nimportance.\nComputers are used in an increasing number of situations,\nfrom scientific calculations to the\nmonitoring of heart patients in\nhospital wards, from banking\n(the new Giro services) to the recording of the passage of bills\nthrough the Florida legislature,\nand new fields of application are\nconstantly opening up.\nApart from jumping straight\ninto programming with nothing\nbehind you but an Imperial College one-week crash course in\nFortran programming (it can and\nhas been done to considerable\nfinancial advantage), there are\nseveral ways of entering the field,\nby taking a course, by joining\none of the computer manufacturing firms, or by becoming qualified in a particular profession\nand subsequently taking a course\nand applying the results in that\nprofession.\nThe scope for using computers\nis vast and getting vaster, and\nthe shortage of good men is not\nshrinking. There are opportunities for considerable success in\nthis country (this is, incidentally,\nnot a field where all the high\nsalaries lie across the Atlantic),\nand the present day is the most\nopportune time to enter.\nQI L fires in particular.
