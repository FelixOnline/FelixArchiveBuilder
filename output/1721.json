The\nSummer term\nexam season has ravaged\nthe Felix team and, un-fortunately, left us with\na second week of what\ncan only be described as\na somewhat streamlined\nissue of Felix. I have to\napologise for dropping\nthe ball - my lack of\nforward planning has\nfinally caught up to\nme and, as a result, the\nNews section has taken\na serious hit. If it weren't\nfor a late anonymous tip,\nwe wouldn't even have a\ncover story this week. I\nhad initially planned an\nin-depth follow-up to\nmy predecessor, Fred's,\nreport on the state of\nImperial's Counselling\nService. It would have\nbeen perfect timing,\nwith this week being\nMental Health Awareness Week and almost\none year to the day since\nFred's original article.\nHowever, largely due to\nmy lack of foresight, it\ndidn't occur to me that\nthe Counselling Service\nmight be overwhelmed\nat a time like this and\nwould be unable to\nspeak to me. Apologies.\nMy error does bring up\nan important point that I'd\nlike to raise.When informing a member of the Felix\nteam that this week is\nMental Health Awareness\nWeek, I was met with the\nresponse, \"I thought that\nwas every week\", and it\ngot me thinking. Although\nit is significant to have\nweeks like this to highlight an issue as important\nas mental health, it is also\n2\nimportant to remember\nthat the work does not stop\nonce this week is over. It\nis important for all of us to\nremain mindful of mental\nhealth - our own and that\nof others. It is especially\nimportant to continue to\nconsider those struggling\nwith mental health. Please\nbear that in mind when\nyou eventually see my\nfollow-up article (in two\nweeks or so).\nIn other news, this\nweek sees the much\nanticipated return of the\nFelix Sex Survey - head\nto bit.ly/felixsexsurvey to\ncomplete it!\nThis week's Felix issue\nalso sees the resurgence\nof the Comment section\nand something of a takeover by Copy Editor Izzy\nZhang, who has a double\npage Politics x Comment\nspread.

Multiple\noptions were considered\nto ensure that the learning\noutcomes of the module\nare assessed as intended.\nFor this reason, a new\nexam has been set for 17th\nMay, 10am - 12pm.\"\nThis decision has\nreportedly not gone down\nwell with the cohort and\nhas been described by\nsome as \"simply unac-ceptable\". An anonymous\nstudent told Felix: \"None\nof the cohort like this\noption. Our voices are not\nbeing heard or considered\nand we are suffering for\nsomeone else's mistake.\"\nIn response to this\nunfortunate situation,\nFelix approached College\nfor comment. A statement given by a College\nspokesperson reads as\nfollows:\n\u201cA recent Corporate\nFinance exam paper was\ngiven to students in error\nahead of the assessment\ninstead of the planned\nsample questions. We\naspire to the highest\nacademic standards for\nour students and, while\nerrors like these are rare,\nwe take them extremely\nseriously. To ensure that\nthe learning outcomes of\nthe module are assessed\nfairly and as intended, a\nnew examination has been\nscheduled for all students\nfor 17th\nMay. This date\nwas selected to minimise\nimpact on students\u2019 other\nwork and assessments.\nHowever we understand\nthat the rescheduling of\nthe exam is frustrating for\nstudents and apologise for\nthe disruption at what we\nknow is already a stressful\ntime. The Business School\nhas been liaising closely\nwith the cohort to assist\nany students experiencing\ndifficulties and is reviewing its processes to ensure\nthat this does not happen\nagain.

    "content": "ISSUE 1721\nFELIX\n18\nINVESTMENT icu.investmentsociety@imperial.ac.uk\nINVESTMENT\nAlexander Koh\nHead of Equities\nInvestment Society\nI\nnvestors are typically\nfaced with the question of how much\na stock (equity) is\nworth. To answer this\nquestion, there are two\nways to value equities.\nThe first method involves\nthe use of ratios and\ncomparison with other\nequities \u2013 relative valuation and the second\nmethod involves the use\nof Discounted Cash Flow\n(DCF) valuation analysis\nto work out the exact\nfair value of a stock. In\nbrief, absolute valuation\nanchors the evaluation of\nthe fair value of a stock\nbased on the earnings and\nfinancial statements of a\ncorporation and utilises\na systematic approach of\nDCF valuation based on\nassumptions of the future\ncash flow of a corporation.\nNevertheless, the assumptions made for DCF\nvaluation acts as a limiting factor in establishing\ntruly accurate results \u2013 it\ndemands clairvoyance to\npostulate future earnings.\nIn this article, we will\nbe exploring the absolute\nvaluation method via the\nmeans of DCF valuation\nto create a financial model\nto evaluate the fair value\nof a stock. There are five\nbasic steps in creating a\nfinancial model for DCF\nvaluations.\n1. Estimating long-term unlevered future\nfree cash flow based on\nhistorical performances\n2. Estimating the\ndiscount rate \u2013 Weighted\nAverage Cost of Capital\n(WACC)\n3. Discounting the\nlong-term future free cash\nflow using the WACC.\n4. Finding out the\nmarket capitalisation\nof the corporation\nAccounts Receivable +\nInventory \u2013 Accounts\nPayable = Current Assets\n(less cash) \u2013 Current\nLiabilities (less debt)\nThe FCFF projections\nare based on certain\nassumptions and FCFF\nprojections in itself is\na large topic. FCFF\nprojection, in brief,\nincludes identifying\nhow the drivers of a\nbusiness and thereby\nforecasting (typically\n5 years into the future)\nthe revenue, expenses,\ncapital assets, capital\nstructure and terminal\nvalue of the company.\nRevenue projections\nare typically based on\neither growth-based or\ndriver based, typically\ngrowth-based models\nsuch as the perpetual\ngrowth rate of 3% is\nused for simplification.\nTerminal value projection\nis typically based on\neither perpetual growth\nrate approach (treating\nit as a perpetuity) or the\nexit multiple approach\n(using EV/EBIDTA). For\nthe sake of simplification,\nwe will assume that FCFF\nprojections have been\nworked out as shown\nbelow, given the following\nassumptions.\nWe will now focus\non the transactional CF\nline which highlights the\nFCFF for both the entry\nand exit (terminal value)\nand the other years of\nprojections.\nNote: In reality, FCFF\nprojectionisacomplicated\ntopic that requires another\ncomprehensive article to\nexplain how to come up\nwith FCFF projections for\ncompanies. We will cover\nFCFF projections in future\narticles on DCF valuation.\nMoreover, you are able to\nattain FCFF projections\nvia the Bloomberg\nTerminal function \u2013 EE\n(Earnings Estimate) & FA\nCF (Cash Flow Analysis).\nThe Bloomberg\nTerminal is a paid\nsubscription (available at\nICL Central Library):\nStep 2. Estimating the\nand tax-adjusted cost of\ndebt.\nThe cost of debt (Rd)\ncan be easily found by\nfinding the yield of the\ncorporate bond offered\nby the corporation in\nquestion. E.g. If the yield\nof the corporate bond =\n5.3% and the tax rate is\n10%, the tax-adjusted cost\nof debt = 4.77%.\nThe cost of equity (Re)\ncan be found by using\nthe Capital Asset Pricing\nModel (CAPM) \u2013 Formula\nshown below \u2013 where the\ncost of equity (Re) is equal\nto the required return for\na security (kj). d in this\narticle.\nby subtracting debt\n(outstanding liabilities)\nand adding cash (asset) on\nhand.\n5. Dividing the\nmarket capitalisation by\nthe number of outstanding\nshares to give the\nestimated fair value of the\nstock.\nNow let us proceed\nwith the step-by-step\nmethodology.\nStep 1. Estimating long-term future unlevered\nfree cash flow based on\nhistorical performances\nIn this step, this\ntypically requires an\ninvestor to make certain\nassumptions. For instance,\nto estimate future cash\nflow, we could assume\nthat a corporation grows\nat a compounded annual\ngrowth rate (CAGR) or a\nperpetual growth rate of\n3%. However, for a start-up, such an assumption\nmay be inappropriate\nand the assumptions\nmade by an analyst\nis highly subjective.\nTherein lies a caveat of\nfinancial modelling, these\nassumptions undermine\nthe accuracy of the\nfinancial models.\nSuppose, however\nthe estimated perpetual\ngrowth rate is accurate.\nFirstly, the cash flows we\nare using are unlevered\nFree Cash Flows (FCFF).\nFCFF refers to the amount\nof cash a company has to\nreinvest in other activities\nor the cash flow left-over\nafter funding growth\nactivities. Note: There are\nother CF analysis methods\nsuch as using levered FCF,\nbut the FCFF method is\nmore frequently used by\nanalyst.\nUsing the balance sheet\nto calculate the FCFF:\nUnlevered FCF =\nEBIT (Earnings before\nInterest & Taxes)*(1-Tax\nRate) + Depreciation &\nAmortisation expense\n\u2013 Capital Expenditure\n\u2013 Increase in Non-Cash\nWorking Capital (NWC)\nWhere NWC =\n\u201cIn this article,\nwe will be\nexploring\nthe absolute\nvaluation\nmethod via the\nmeans of DCF\u201d\nCash Flow Statement\nEducational:PerformingAbsoluteEvaluation\nWeighted Averge Cost of Capital\ndiscount rate \u2013 Weighted\nAverage Cost of Capital\n(WACC)\nThe WACC is given by\nthe formula below \u2013 i.e.\nit is a weighted average\nbetween the cost of equity\nISSUE 1721\nFELIX\n19\nINVESTMENT icu.investmentsociety@imperial.ac.uk\nHowever, all the\nparameters for CAPM\ncan be found via Yahoo!\nFinance or through the\nBloomberg Terminal \u2013\nCommand Line: WACC.\nThe cost of equity (Re)\ncan be found by using\nthe Capital Asset Pricing\nModel (CAPM) \u2013 Formula\nshown below \u2013 where the\ncost of equity (Re) is equal\nto the required return for a\nsecurity (kj). To minimise\nthe confusion, the CAPM\nwill not be covered in this\narticle. However, all the\nparameters for CAPM\ncan be found via Yahoo!\nFinance or through the\nBloomberg Terminal \u2013\nCommand Line: WACC.\nStep 3. Discounting the\nlong-term future free cash\nflow using the WACC.\nTo understand the\nconcept of discounting\na cash flow, remember\nthis phrase \u201cA dollar\ntoday is worth more than\na dollar tomorrow\u201d. Let\nus illustrate this with\nan example. Tim is an\ninvestor who puts $1 in\nhis bank account with an\nannual interest rate of 5%,\nthis implies that at the end\nof the 1st year, Tim has\n$1.05 and at the end of the\n2nd year, Tim has $1.05 *\n1.05 = $1.1025. At the end\nof 2 years, the future value\nof his initial investment =\n$1.1025, but his initial\ninvestment, termed as the\npresent value (PV) still\nremains at $1, where PV =\n$1.1025/1.052 = $1.\nSimilar to this idea, you\ncannot simply compare\ncash flows at a different\npoints of a timeline. $100\nat the 0th year is worth\nmore than $100 in the\n2nd year as you would be\nforgoing interest earned in\n2years.Hence,tocompare\ncash flows at different\npoint in time, you would\nhave to discount the cash\nflow by the interest rate\n(the opportunity cost).\nHence, an extension of\nthis to the DCF formula\nwould be as follows,\nwhere CF refers to the\nfree cash flow of the\ncorporation in the future\nand r refers to the discount\nrate given by the WACC.:\ncompany\u2019s FCF), you\nwould have to calculate\nthe Market Capitalisation,\nfrom the Enterprise Value\nresults from your DCF\nvaluation of the projected\nFCF of the company.\nAfter adding the\nEnterprise Value with the\nCash & Cash Equivalents\nand subtracting total debt,\nthe final value would\nyield the Equity Value/\nMarket Capitalisation of\nthe company.\nStep 5. Dividing the\nmarket capitalisation by\nthe number of outstanding\nshares to give the\nestimated fair value of the\nstock.\nThe intrinsic market\ncapitalisation (the value\nderived after subtracting\ndebt and cash from EV)\ndivided by the total\nnumber of outstanding\nshares (20,000 in this\nexample) would yield\nthe intrinsic value of per\nshare.\nAssuming the current\nmarket capitalisation of\nthe share (valued by the\nmarket) is $500,000 and\nthe current price of the\nshare is $25.00, you can\nsee that the intrinsic value\nof the equity value/share\nis greater than the current\nshare price i.e. The share\nis undervalued and may\nbe a good purchase.\nConclusion:\nWhile DCF analysis\nmay seem like a powerful\ntool (that can be easily\nrelied upon with the use of\nthe Bloomberg Terminal),\nthere lies multiple\ndisadvantageous of DCF\nanalysis. Firstly, share\nprices reflect the market\u2019s\nsentiments towards the\ncorporation. In times of\nlow investor confidence\n\u2013 Global Financial Crisis\n08, Dotcom Bubble 2000s\n\u2013regardlessoftheintrinsic\nvalue of the corporation,\ninvestors would severely\nundervalue corporations\nin light of the poor market\noutlook. Moreover,\nDCF analysis is heavily\ninfluenced by the WACC\n\u2013 values which are\nsubjective in nature \u2013 for\ninstance, the systematic\nrisk (beta) can easily be\nvalued differently (e.g.\nusing a 5-year vs 10-year\noutlook or using different\nstatistical approach).\nLastly, private equity\nand start-ups (with their\nfinancial statements being\nunattainable) is a problem\nwhich many analysts\nwould face. Predicting\nthe growth drivers and\nfinding accurate estimates\nfor FCFF is a Sisyphean\ntask, given the dynamic\nnature of start-ups.\nNevertheless, DCF\nanalysis allows an analyst\nto come up with a good\nyardstick and estimate\nof what a corporation\nis valued at. It is the\ntool of choice for both\ninvestment bankers and\nequity research analyst\nalike.\nUsing the FCFF\nprojections listed under\nthe Transaction CF:\nWe can use excel to\ncalculate the discounted\ncash flow, using the\nformula XPNV, which\ngives the discounted cash\nflow figure i.e. Net Present\nValue (NPV) of the overall\nFCFF projections:\nThe NPV of this cash\nflow figure would yield\nthe Enterprise Value (EV)\nof the company.\nStep 4. Finding out\nthe market capitalisation\nof the corporation by\nsubtracting debt and\nadding cash on hand.\nMarket Capitalisation =\nEnterprise Value + Cash &\nCash Equivalents \u2013 Total\nDebt\nGiven that the DCF\nanalysis yields the\nEnterprise Value of the\ncompany \u2013 measure of\na company\u2019s total value.\nTo calculate the intrinsic\nvalue (based on the\n\u201cLies multiple\ndisadvantageous\nof DCF\nanalysis.\nFirstly, share\nprices reflect\nthe market\u2019s\nsentiments\ntowards the\ncorporation\u201d\nDCF Valuation\n\n"

However,\nhis special attacks are\nwhat make him\u2026 well\u2026\nspecial, by trading the\nmany tools Mario had for\nactual attacks and unique\nabilities.\nAt his core, Luigi is\nvery similar to Mario,\nwith his normal attacks the\nheart of his kit. He throws\nsome decently quick\njabs and tilts, with some\nmoderately powerful\nsmash attacks. And again\nthe aerials are the most\nimportant parts of the\nmoveset. All of them are\nextremely quick with\nminimal lag time, with\nthe forward-air being the\nquickest. The up-air great\nfor juggling, back-air for\nfinishing, down-air for\nspiking and neutral-air\nfor all-round attack. As\nJumpman\u2019s brother, it\u2019s in\nthe air where he shines.\n\u201cNintendo\nmay roast him\nall they want\nbut he won\nsome of the\ncommunities\u2019\nlove with his\ninfamous\nmeme,\nWeegee\u201d\n\u201cIf Luigi hits\nthe sweet spot\nat the very\nbeginning of\nthis move, it\nwill hit the\nopponent\ncritically and\nkill them at\nonly 60%\u201d\nL u i g i , h o w e v e r ,\ndiverges from the path\nset by Mario with his\nspecials. The neutral B\nis not so unique, it is\na simple Fireball that\nmoves straight ahead and\ncan stagger opponents.\nLuigi\u2019s side-special is his\nGreen Missile, a charged\nattack that makes him dive\nforwards head-first into\nhis enemies. This should\nbe used mostly as a horizontal recovery; however,\nthis attack also comes\nwith a surprise. Indeed, at\nevery use Green Missile\nhas a 1 in 10 chance of ex-ploding, propelling Luigi\neven further and faster.\nThis is a nice finisher for\nany unsuspecting enemy,\nbut one has to count on\ntheir luck for this to be the\ncase.\nHis up-special is the\nSuper Jump Punch, a\npurely vertical recovery\nmove with a twist: if\nLuigi hits the sweet spot\nat the very beginning\nof this move, it will hit\nthe opponent critically\nand can kill an opponent\nwho is at 60%! To do so\nLuigi must be facing the\nenemy fighter, stand as\nclose as possible to them,\nas he does his Super\nJump Punch. Beware,\nhowever, both his up- and\nside-special have a very\nlong lag-time so are easily\npunished if you miss them.\nFor a safer attack, you\nhave his down-special, the\nLuigi Cyclone, a spinning\nattack with invincibility\nframes at the start and\na generous hitbox and\nknockback as opponents\nget sucked in.\nIn addition to his\nalready very quirky\nspecials, Luigi has 2\nother notable traits to top\nthe icing on the cake. He\nis first of all the proud\nowner of a ghost-sucking\nvacuum cleaner, which\nhe uses as a tether grab.\nHowever ridiculous it\nmay look, it is still an\nincredibly useful attribute\nto grab opponents from a\nsafe distance.\nAnd saving the best for\nlast, Luigi has a forbidden\ntechnique call the Weegee\nkick. A move so good that\nit is banned from online\nplay: his down-taunt.\nThat\u2019s right, Luigi is the\nonly character to have a\ntaunt that actually does\nsomething; it does only\n2.4% damage but it spikes!\nIt is immensely difficult\nto pull off as the timing\nhas to be just right but if\nyou manage to 2-frame\nan enemy as they recover\nwith the Weegee kick,\nyou\u2019ll have an extremely\nsatisfying kill. Sadly,\nThanks to Nintendo\u2019s\n\u2018No Fun Allowed Online\u2019\nrule, this secret technique\nis banned in quickplay as\nall taunts are disabled, so\nyou\u2019ll have to invite your\nfriends over or create an\narena to humiliate them\npersonally.\nDespite all his funny\nmoves and specials, it is\ncrucialto keep in mind that\nLuigi is first and foremost\na combo character. In\norder to win, you will\nneed to abuse the speed\nof your aerials to chain\nattacks on your opponent\nwithout allowing them\nto fight back in. In par-ticular, the down-aerial\nshould be used at the end\nof every aerial play to\nspike the enemy fighter\non the stage, leaving you\nmore time to land, follow\nup with another attack,\nto ultimately keep the\ncombo going. Once they\nhave enough percentage,\nyou can finish them off\nwith one of your specials,\nsmash attacks, or throws.\nOnce you have mastered\nthe Weegee, you will be\nable to pull off some zero\nto death combos (check\nout the great video from\nBeefy Smash Doods for\nmore details on \u201cLuigi\u2019s\nInsane Combo Game\u201d).\nOverall, Luigi is\na mid-tier character\nbecause his attacks seem\nto be designed to be funny\nrather than reliable. This\ngreen plumber still poses\na great threat thanks to his\ngreat combo potential, his\nquirky specials and techniques are just an added\nA truly beautiful sky // Nintendo and Memes\nISSUE 1721\nFELIX\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n10\nbonus to enjoy.

    "content": "Mycoprotein: a potential beneficial food for people\nwith type 2 diabetes?\nSCIENCE\nAnna ChertaI\nf I were to ask you\nthe first thing that\ncomes to mind when\nyou think of fungi,\nyou would probably say\nmouldy walls, gone-off\nfood, or athlete\u2019s foot. The\nFungi kingdom is often\nnot viewed in a positive\nlight. However, we owe a\nlot to fungi; they produce\nlife-saving antibiotics,\nhave allowed organ trans-plantations in humans and\ncan recycle many types\nof waste. In the area of\nnutrition, some fungi\nalso have the potential to\naffect human health in a\nbeneficial way, although\nlittle research has been\ndevoted to it compared\nto other foods. In the\nNutrition Section of the\nDepartment of Medicine\nat Imperial College\nLondon, we are putting\nfungi into the limelight\nand studying the impact of\na particular type of fungus\non blood sugar levels and\nappetite in South Asian\nand European people with\nType 2 Diabetes (T2D).\nThe Problem\n1 out of 20 people\nworldwide has T2D,\nwith South Asians being\nmore prone to the disease\ncompared to Europeans.\nPeople with T2D have\nhigher blood sugar levels\nthan normal, which over\ntime can increase the\nchances of developing\nlong-term complications\nsuch as blindness, kidney\ndisease and heart failure.\nIt is therefore important\nto manage blood sugar\nlevels in people with\nT2D in order to keep\nblood sugar in the normal\nrange. The first-line\nstrategy to achieve this\nis by improving dietary\nintake. Healthy, balanced\ndiets are generally characterised as being high in\ndietary fibre and protein,\nwhich decrease both blood\nsugar levels and appetite.\nIf blood sugar levels are\nreduced toward normal\nlevels, the chances of\nhaving T2D-related complications are reduced.\nLikewise, if appetite is\ndecreased, intake of ener-gy-rich foods will likely\nalso decrease, helping\nto reduce body weight,\nwhich is a key risk factor\nfor T2D. However, an\nongoing problem with\nhealthy diets is that they\nare not suitable for all\ncultures and most of the\nresearch around them has\nbeen conducted in people\nof European origin, therefore not being applicable\nto South Asians. Furthermore, people often find it\ndifficult to stick to these\ndiets.\nThe Potential Solu\u201cDiet is a\ncheaper tool to\nmanage blood\nsugar than\ndiabetic drugs\u201d\n\u201c1 out of\n20 people\nworldwide\nhas Type 2\nDiabetes, with\nSouth Asians\nbeing more\nprone to the\ndisease than\nEuropeans \u201d\nis low in fat and calories\nand high in both dietary\nfibre and protein.\nMycoprotein is commercially available across\nEurope, North America\nand Asia under the brand\nname of \u201cQuorn\u201d, which\nmakes it suitable and accessible to many cultures.\nIn addition, mycoprotein\u2019s\nappearance and texture\nhas been shown to be very\nsimilar to animal-derived\nmeat as both microscopic structures are very\nsimilar, with the exception that mycoprotein\u2019s\nstructure is surrounded\nby fibre (Figure 1). Professor Gary Frost, head\nof the Nutrition Section at\nImperial College London,\nsaid: \u201cMycoprotein has a\nunique food matrix, which\nmay act as a barrier for\nsugar absorption during\ndigestion, therefore improving sugar levels in\nblood.\u201d\nSince mycoprotein is\nhigh in both dietary fibre\nand protein, suitable for\nall cultures, widely available and has a similar taste\nto meat, we believe that\nit could be an effective\nfood for regulating blood\nsugar levels and appetite\nin people with T2D.\nThe question\nWe have previously\nshown that mycoprotein\nhas a positive effect on\nblood sugar levels and\nappetite in healthy people\nwho do not have T2D,\nbut little is known about\nthis effect in people with\nT2D from South Asian\nand European ancestry. It\nis for this reason that we\nare investigating whether\nmycoprotein alone, or in\ncombination with another\nfibre called guar gum, is\nable to reduce blood sugar\nlevels and appetite in both\nethnic groups. Professor\nGaryFrostadded:\u201cInstead\nof testing a sole food, we\nare testing what a usual\nmeal would be, such as\nmince mycoprotein with\nrice accompanied by a\nchapatti bread. This bread\nhas guar gum incorporated into the dough. We\nthink that, by combining\nboth types of fibre (myco-protein and guar gum), an\nadditive effect in lowering\nblood sugar levels could\noccur in people with T2D,\nregardless of their ethnicity.\u201d\nWhy is this impor-Can you contribute to\nFigure 1: This figure illustrates the similarities and differences between mycoprotein (at the top) and chicken (at the\nbottom) when you zoom in at different levels of detail. // Anna Cherta-Murillo\nISSUE 1721\nFELIX\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n7\nMurillo\nScience Editor\ntion\nOne food that is high\nin both dietary fibre and\nprotein is mycoprotein.\nMycoprotein is the name\ngiven to the biomass of a\nfungus called Fusarium\nvenenatum.

They follow the\ntwitter account of an organization that campaigns\nto take away support from\ntrans children at school\nand frequently retweets\nRay Blanchard, one of the\nworld\u2019s best-known academic transphobes. Based\non their social media,\nyou might make some\nsensible inferences about\nwhat your friend thinks\npersonally and that some\nof their worldview is not\nas woke as you have come\nto expect from your peers\nin 2019. The beliefs this\nperson apparently holds\nare clearly retrograde and\nwrong, but they are not\nwhat I want to talk about.\nLast week, Felix reprinted the public letter\nto a member of the university\u2019s senior manage-ment, asking them and\nthe college to reiterate\ntheir support of trans\npeople and to respond\npublicly to concerns\nregarding their social\nmedia sharing. Said\nperson has since they\nwere first approached\ndeleted the objectionable\ntweets and unfollowed\nthe mentioned accounts,\nbut I do not know if\nthis step is necessarily\nhelpful towards LGBT+\nliberation.\nI am not saying that\nImperial does not still\nhave a long way to go\nin terms of its treatment\nof trans people. As the\nletter itself cites, a significant proportion feels\nexcluded and more help\nneeds to be made availa-ble, but prescribing who\nto follow and not follow\non social media will only\nalienate, perhaps even\nthe specific person you\nare trying to convince to\nchange their mind. Posts\non social media are\nsomewhere in the gray\nzone between public\nand private, but they\nare some of the primary\nways we express ourselves today and so\nought to be protected.\nBringing in the college\nto enforce posting habits\nmeans we are making\nprivate support for trans\nrights the ideological\nlitmus test for randos,\nor rather, people whose\nopinions on the matter\ndo not really affect\nanything.\nThere is the question\nof how visible and im-pactful a person must be\nbefore their thoughts and\nself-expression needs to\nbe scrutinized, but in\nthis case I would say the\nperson is more in the let\nit go category. I doubt\nauthor and recipient\nmention the opportunity\nfor \u201cdebate\u201d somewhere\nelse, but, as Willsher\ncorrectly identifies, that\ncan often be damaging\nto trans people as it\nmakes their existence a\npoint a discussion and\nsomething up for grabs.\nSocial media is not the\nplace for it, but neither\nis probably a South\nKensington campus.\nPrivately approaching\nsomeone is probably the\nbest way to convince\nthem, but that can\ntake years and is often\nfrankly just impossible.\nBut you have to try to\nchange minds, in a real\nlong-lasting way, not\njust censor their tweets\nand bringing in the\ncollege.\n\u201cWe Won\u2019t be Erased\u201drally for trans rights in Washington D.C., USA // ...\ntheir preconceptions.\nWhen it comes to asking\nothers to take down\ntweets, especially when\nthey were already more\nthan 6 months old when\nfound judging by the\nFelix photo, it sounds\nmore like an exercise\nof power rather than a\nmeans social progress.\nIn the last paragraph\nof the Felix article, Josef\nWillsher, the author of\nthe letter, says of the\nvice-provost using their\n\u201cpublic Twitter account\nto engage with tweets\nand to share articles\u2026\nwe really didn\u2019t think\nit\u2019s the place to do that\u201d,\nwhich, while begging\nthe question of what a\ntwitter account is for in\nthat case, is a sentiment\nI sympathize with.

Eventually, the\ncrowds thin out as people\ngravitate towards the\ncentre of the exhibition,\npondering human barbarity and how many more\nphotographs they can\nhandle.\nBehind the closed\ndoors of the exhibition is\na world apart, one littered\nwith hauntingly graphic\nphotos that tear each\nvisitor from their comfort\nzone. Here, the famous\nimage of an American\nsoldier, stationed in\nVietnam, staring out at\nthe audience. Shell-shock,\nPTSD, whatever you\nwant to call it - nothing\ndoes justice to the terrors\nthat ripple across his jet-black pupils. Or the dead\nCongolese fighter, face\ntorn apart by the path of\na bullet. Almost more\npainful than the content\nis the knowledge that\nthese conflicts, and the\nmany others exhibited,\nare not just confined to\nhistory. Disfigured child\nvictims of Agent Orange,\na carcinogenic pesticide\nthe Americans sprayed\non Vietnam\u2019s leafy land-scape, or the traumatised\nex-child soldiers on the\nstreets of Brazzaville,\nCongo, are a stark\nreminder that suffering\nescapes the crystallised\nmoment one finds within\nthe frame.\nAmongst the tropical\nwarfare and devastation\nare close-up portraits of\nsome residents of the\nEast End. Homeless, dejectedly poor, often Irish,\nthese were the people\nwho lived on the streets\nof Shoreditch well before\ngentrification drove itinerants to other parts of the\ncity. The subjects of the\nphotographs include Jean,\na woman of indeterminate\nage but all-too-familiar\ncircumstance. It was in the\npictures of her, as much\nas the ones of overseas\nconflict, that one can\nappreciate what French\nsemiotician and theorist\nRoland Barthes described\nso accurately when he saw\nthe camera as a potent tool\nin making the \u201cinvisible,\nvisible\u201d. Her face, etched\nwith the wrinkles and\nlines of a life of hardship,\nare more than physical\nsigns of age. In another\nphoto, she squats with her\nhead in her hands. This is\nthe existential paralysis of\npoverty in action, leaving\nthe vulnerable to suffer\ntheir wretched plight. That\nthis perennial problem\nexists in a frame in one of\nLondon\u2019s top galleries is\ntestament to McCullin\u2019s\nability to straddle aesthetics and empowerment.\nWhether the audience can\nonly contemplate such\ninjustice through art is a\nquestion that lingers well\nafter you leave.\nThe intertwined history\nof photography and\nmental illness reaches\nfar before McCullin took\nto the streets of the East\nEnd. During the mid-19th\ncentury, psychiatrist and\namateur photographer Dr\nHugh Welch Diamond\ntook to photographing the\nresidents of the Surrey\nCounty Asylum. The\nphotographs carry a consistent style: the subject\nis seated, wearing clean\nand formal clothing, face\nturned to the lens. While\nMcCullin\u2019s photographs\nare intentionally mono-chromatic, Diamond was\nmore restricted by the\ntechnology of the time.\nIn fact, William Henry\nFox Talbot had only introduced photography to\nBritish society 3 months\nprior to Diamond\u2019s first\nphotograph. Whether\nthrough the sheer passage\nof time, or an indifference\nto the identity of the sitter,\nmost of those in the frame\nremain anonymous. The\nsepia-toned portrait to the\nleft shows one such nameless subject. Captured in\n1855 (towards the end\nof Diamond\u2019s photography career), this simple\nphoto bears a remarkable\nsimilarity to that of Jean,\ndespite over a century\nseparating these two\nwomen. The dishevelled\nhair, the head tilted know-ingly, the weathered face.\nYet the formal clothing of\nthe anonymous lady, the\ndrapes in the background,\nand the posture all betray\nany sense of authenticity.\nThis woman\u2019s photograph\nwas as much defined by\nwhat was being thought,\nand organised, behind the\nlens, as the mood captured\nby her expression. Jean,\nby comparison, casually\nholds a cigarette and\nseems mid-speech. But\nhow did the mentally ill\ngo from detained to des-titute? To understand this,\nwe have to briefly witness\nthe death of one of England\u2019s most controversial\ninstitutions: the asylum.\nIn 1962, UK Health\nSecretary Enoch Powell\n(of \u2018Rivers of Blood\u2019\ninfamy) announced the\nHospital Plan, an effort\nto move patients with\nmental health conditions\nfrom the confines of the\nasylum to the care of\nthe community. Historians saw the move as a\nconcession to increasing\npatient rights\u2019 advocacy, a\npro-austerity government,\nand an attempt to redress\nthe abuses which took\nplace within the asylum\nwalls. The latter reason\nstands out as a fascinating\nexample of how British\nradicalism and reformism joined forces in the\n18th and 19th century to\ncounter the profiteering\nand widescale abuse of\nvulnerable patients. For\nsome, the demise of the\nasylum was celebrated\nas an existential victory.\nCounter-culture theorists\nlike Michel Foucault and\nErving Goffman saw\nthe asylum as a place\nof oppressive doctrine\nor identity-stripping,\nrespectively. One Flew\nOver the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest,\nKen Kesey\u2019s 1962 masterpiece novel, pitted the\nimprisoned and oppressed\nresidents of an asylum\nagainst the authoritarian\ndictatorship of the medical\nestablishment. In an effort\nto critique the carceral\nnature of the asylum, the\nso-called anti-psychiatry\nmovement of the 1960s\nand 70s hastened its over-throw, but with no safety\nnet for transition into\nbetter mental healthcare\nservices. This deinstitu-tionalisation, which ultimately led to the struggle\nthat community mental\nhealth services continue\nwith to this day, left many\nof the most vulnerable to\nthe cruelty of the streets.\nIn 2014, 45% of the\nhomeless population of\nthe UK had a diagnosed\nmental health condition.\nFrom the ruins of the\nasylum came a new era of\nsuffering.\nIn examining the\nstriking images of the\nmentally ill, viewers may\nwonder why the photographers reached for the lens\nin response to the suffering which they witnessed.\nDiamond sought to use\nphotography for science,\nto bring madness within\nthe realm of rationalism.A\nproponent of the pseudoscience of physiognomy,\nhe believed that mental\nillnesses carried external,\nvisible physical stigmata.\nThus, a photograph was\nan important resource in\ndiagnosis. Going further,\nDiamond also suggested\nthat allowing a patient to\nsee their current disposition may spur them into\nrecovery.

It\u2019s\neternally performed,\neternally taught, eternally\nlauded. A play one has\nprobably lied about seeing\nat some point, not out of\nsome desire to impress,\nbut a sincere sense that\nit\u2019s always been there and\n\u201cof course I\u2019ve seen it!\u201d.\nSuch is it status that when\nit\u2019s listed to be performed\nagain, one doesn\u2019t have a\nsense of excitement but\nrather a feeling we\u2019re\ngoing through the standard\nrituals of theatre watch-ing. But now I should be\nemphatically clear, here at\nthe Young Vic this feeling\nis completely blown away\n\u2013 this is a production of\nsuch power and talent\nthat a genuine sense of\ngratitude and awe is being\nexcreted from each pore as\nyou stand to clap the cast\ncome the end of the near\nthree hour performance.\nWendell Pierce\u2019s\nperformance as Willy\nLoman is one that spans\ntime, we\u2019re in 1949 with\nhim but also recognising\ndeeply modern themes\nwithin ourselves. The\nsense of great change in\nthe world around you that\nseeps from the play is\ntransmitted wonderfully\nfrom Pierce\u2019s powerhouse\nof a performance. Pierce\nsets a bar that is high but\nit is certainly met by his\ncast members with Arinze\nKene as Biff Loman\nand Martins Imhangbe\nas Happy Loman also\nputting in performances\nof stupendous quality.\nKene\u2019s writhing, seething\nand pained demeanour\nthroughout conveys the\ntorment that is the essence\nof Biff Loman\u2019s sense\nof wrong in the world.\nWhereas Imhangbe\ndisplays the dual con-sciousness, the smile on\nthe troubled soul, the\nblissful ignorance and\ninsidious committal to\nthe American dream that\nunderlines the Loman\nfamily fate wonderfully.\nThe duo\u2019s chemistry and\nphysicality mean you will\nbe hard pushed to find\na better pair of Loman\nbrothers on stage.\nfrom the rural American\nsouth to the industrialised\nnorth. One can\u2019t help but\nhaving a nagging sense\nthe Loman fate is as much\na result of discrimination\nas of their naive committal to America. A feeling\nthat is only exaggerated\nwhen the successes of the\nwhite Bernard (Ian Bonar)\nand Howard Wagner\n(Matthew Seadon-Young)\nare made clear.\nW\nhat begins\nas a simple\np a r -ent-teacher\nmeeting between recently\nseparated Brian (Stephen\nJones) and Donna (Sarah\nMorris), and teacher\nMr McAfferty (Will\nO\u2019Connell), to talk about\ntheir son Jayden\u2019s literacy struggles in school,\nspirals quickly as tension\nbubbles about social and\ncultural divides within\nthe classroom. Scenes\nflicker between the\nparent-teacher meeting,\nand also student-teacher\nafter-school \u2018homework\nclub\u2019, as Morris and Jones\ndeftly switch between\nplaying Brian and Donna\nto Jayden and classmate\nKaylie. Morris does a\nparticularly good job of\nswitching to an energetic\nKaylie at the drop of a hat,\nreally capturing the playfulness of a nine-year-old.\nThis play confidently\nasks questions about the\ncomplexities of a failing\neducation system. How\ndoes a difficult domestic\nsituation affect important\ndecision-making for your\nchildren? What decision is\n\u2018right\u2019 as a teacher when\nschool rules conflict with\npersonal ideologies of a\ncourse of action? How\nhave both educators and\nparent alike been jaded\nby the education system?\nIs it the children who ultimately lose out amidst all\nthis power play between\nparent and teacher?\nThere are no conclusive\nanswers, and we are left\nfeeling emotionally suck-er-punched by the end.\ndown to, as well as\nreminding Donna of her\nown experiences being\nlet down by the education\nsystem. They begin with\nthe thought that they don\u2019t\nwant their child \u201cgoing\nthrough the rest of his\nlife thinking something\nis wrong with him\u201d, and\nMr McAfferty\u2019s superflu-ous, almost patronising,\nlanguage only exacerbates\ntheir insecurities and\nuncertainties.\nTime is split between\nmoments of humour,\nmoments of discomfort,\nand moments of hostility,\nbut they all piece together\nwell to tell an interesting\nstory. We never leave\nthe classroom, creating\na confined environment\nfor the escalating drama\nand shock ending. The\ncharacters are well-de-veloped, particular Mr\nMcAfferty, and O\u2019Connell does a brilliant job\nswitching between the\nsoft-spoken personality\nwe see initially, his enthusiastic interaction with\nthe students, and his evolution to condescension\ntowards the parents, then\naggressive, then regret-ful. The scene switches\nbetween parent-teacher\nand student-teacher really\nhighlight the juxtaposition between his two\n\u2018personalities\u2019 and how\nhe changes as the play\nprogresses.\nMy only criticism\nwould be that 95-minutes\nseemed a little long, especially with no interval,\nand although it didn\u2019t\nstruggle to capture my attention for the full length\nof the play, it did move a\nlittle slowly at points. But\nstellar performances and\ninsightful subject matter\nstill make this play well\nworth the watch.\nSarah Morris as Donna// Ross Kavanagh\nEvoking the American Dream // Brinkhoff Mogenburg\nOut of Water Avalanche: A Love Story\nO\nrange Tree\nTheatre, once\nagain, has a\nstunning new\nproduction running. This\ntouching play, written\nby the remarkable Zoe\nCooper, spans themes of\ngender identity, sexuality,\nnew environments, and\nhardship. A delicately\nwritten script, along with\ncircular staging and a trio\nof talented performers,\nmade this a show to\nremember.\nThe story follows mid-dle-class Londoner Claire\n(Lucy Briggs-Owen)\nmoving to her wife Kit\u2019s\n(Zoe West) north-eastern\ncoastal hometown, South\nShields, to have their\nbaby. As she starts her\nnew job in a school, she\nencounters Fish (Tilda\nWickham), a gender-fluid\npupil who she begins to\nmentor. The three actors\nundertake more roles\nthan just this, and they\nsuccinctly switch between\ncharacters impressively.\nWest stood out to me\nin this regard, slipping\nbetween the charming and\nconfident Kit, curmudgeonly senior male teacher,\nand underachieving,\nchavvy teenage student,\nwith ease. I wish we had\nseen more of Kit, and her\ninteractions with Claire \u2013\nit was quite focussed on\nClaire (despite a brilliant\njob by Briggs-Owen) and\nher struggling to adapt\nto her new environment,\nbut I\u2019m guessing it was\nmeant to be this way. I\njust really fell in love with\nKit\u2019s boyish charm and\naffection and wish she\u2019d\nbeen a bigger part of the\nstoryline. Wickham really\nshone in their entrancing\nmonologue, lip-syncing\nnature documentary\nexcepts and utilising fluid\nhand movements to mimic\nfish the subject matter.\nwhere she doesn\u2019t correct\nthem anymore, and also\nwith the disapproving\nsneers towards affection\nbetween her and her wife\nby people in her new\nenvironment, including\nKit\u2019s own family.\nH\nope springs\neternal; that is\nboth a blessing\nand curse for\nJulie Leigh\u2019s protagonist,\nthe Woman (Maxine\nPeake), in Avalanche:\nA Love Story. We meet\nPeake\u2019s nameless\ncharacter at a psychic\u2019s\ngathering, which is really\nsomething of a supernaturally tinged group therapy\nsession. Everyone there\nis seeking to let go of a\nloved one; the Woman is\ntoo, only her loved one,\na longed for child, has\nnever existed.\nPeake commands the\nvast Barbican stage masterfully as she unspools\na winding, tragic tale\nof loves lost and found.\nBased on Leigh\u2019s bestselling memoirs, the story\nis of a woman in her late\nthirties who has found\nmoderate professional\nsuccess and is on the\ncusp of greater acclaim\nliving a lonely existence\nin New York. By chance\nshe meets her high-school\nsweetheart; they rekindle\ntheir past affair with\nlustful passion, pledge to\nbe together always and\nreturn home to Sydney to\nmarry and raise a family.\nThe optimism of the\ncouple\u2019s early reunion\nfizzles shortly and The\nWoman\u2019s life descends\nslowly into a carousel\nof clinic appointments,\nanger and hopelessness in\nwhich her world narrows\nto her overwhelming\nneed for a child. If hope\nis the catalyst that sparks\nthe story, power, or the\nlack of it is the fuel on\nwhich it propels itself.\nIn one telling scene, the\nWoman\u2019s husband, angry\nthat his wife has put\ntheir strict baby-making\nschedule on hold to direct\na movie threatens to leave\nher, and propose they live\nin separate houses whilst\nstaying married. She is hu-miliated, but returns to his\nbed that night to resume\ntrying for a baby. Peake\ntells us of this episode\nwith a wry smile, devastating her quiet sadness.\nLater, after her sixth or\nseventh cycle of IVF has\nfailed, The Woman is\npersuaded by her doctor to\nreturn just one more time\nto a gruelling regime of\ndaily hormone injections\nand endless visits to the\ngynaecologists in the face\nof ever lengthening odds\nof success, it is a privilege\nfor which she\u2019ll have to\npay $7000. As she leaves\nthe appointment, she\nnotices a Bentley in the\ndoctors\u2019 parking space.\nTo hold an audience\ncaptive for more than\nan hour by oneself in a\ntheatre as huge as the\nBarbican is no mean feat,\nbut Peake, under the direction of Anne Louise Sarks\nmanages it with ease. She\nis wholly naturalistic as\nshe moves across the stage\nas we see her unravel\nfrom a woman sure of\nherself to one undone by\nwave after wave of loss.\nAs the play progresses\nand the Woman comes to\nbe at peace with her child-lessness, the stark white\nwalls of Marg Howell\u2019s\nset move in concert;\ndeconstructing the austere\nconfines of clinic to reveal\na desolate, but beautiful\nwildness beyond.\nLetting go // Barbican\nLucy Briggs-Owen, Tilda Wickham and Zoe West // The\nOther Richard\nIntelligent reinvention strikes new chords.\nARTS\nCalvin Nesbitt\nArts Writer\nWhere?

That\u2019s\nwhat Suburban Express,\na bus company based in\nIllinois, promises their\ncustomers will not feel\nwhen on their buses.\nThe Urbana-Champaign\ncampus of the University\nof Illinois (UIUC) has\ndrawn a surging population of Chinese students\nto the area, apparently\ntoo many for the liking of\nSuburban Express. They\nsent out a mass marketing\nemail in December 2017\nthat had \u201cPassengers like\nyou. You won\u2019t feel like\nyou\u2019re in China when\nyou\u2019re on our buses.\u201d\nThe company shut\ndown its operations last\nweek (7th\nMay); it has\na long history of racist\nbehaviour, and not just\nagainst Chinese people.\nAll the same, it made\nme want to reflect objectively on the general\nperceptions people have\nabout overseas Chinese\nstudents, in and out of\nImperial, and whether\nor not these views\nare justified. Mainly\nbecause, although I was\nborn and raised in Hong\nKong, my parents were\nborn in China and so\nmy personal culture and\nsense of identity has\nelements of both.\nChinese students are\noften seen as self-segre-gating, and not making\nan effort to intermingle\nwith the rest of the\nstudent body. There is\nan element of truth in\nthis, but it is certainly\nnot a conscious effort\nby Chinese students\nto avoid other races.\nIt is understandable\nfor people to get along\nbetter with those similar\nto them. China is\nculturally and racially\nhomogenous; Chinese\nchildren grow up around\nothers like them, and\nthe mixing of different\nforeign cultures is not as\ncommon as in Western\ncountries. There are\nother cultural disparities\nto consider: socialising\nin Western culture often\ninvolves alcohol, but\nteenage culture in the\nEast is overall more con-servative, and involves\nmuch less casual consumption of alcohol,\ncigarettes, and drugs.\nIt\u2019s probably easier to\nfeel socially accepted\naround and easier to\nbuild trust with people\nfrom your country; there\nis solace in finding a\ngroup that you fit in\nwith, and because, on\nfirst impression, it felt\neasiest to find things\nin common with your\nco-nationals, you decide\nto stick with them. Especially when English is a\nsecond language; I can\nimagine what a relief it\nis to have conversations\nthat do not require\nconstant mental back-and-forth translating.\nOf course, this behaviour of homophily\n(an internal preference\nfor people like you, in\nterms of race or age or\nprofession etc) doesn\u2019t\napply solely to Chinese\nstudents. I find this to\nbe the crux of having a\ndiverse community. The\nvalue of diversity comes\nfrom having people with\nunique backgrounds\nand perspectives, and to\ntake advantage of such\na community would\nrequire intermingling\nof people who do not\nhave much in common.\nHowever, without any\nhomophilicity, there are\nfewer channels through\nwhich people can\nembrace their heritage,\nand ultimately there is\na loss in the value of\nhaving an international\ncommunity to begin\nwith.\nFurthermore, while\nyou want to encourage\nall students from all\ncountries to socialise\noutside their co-national\ncircles, students from\ncountries with larger\ncultural barriers will inevitably be less willing.\nYou cannot single out\nthe students of one race\nas being more closed-off\nwhen they face a bigger\nchallenge.\nFor a while, I assumed\nthat all international\nstudents who decide\nto study overseas must\nwant to experience\nliving away from home,\nto meet people and visit\nplaces that you otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able\nto, and to learn from\neverything a diverse\ninternational community\nhas to offer. I realise this\nisn\u2019t always true. You\nmay come to Imperial\nwith the sole intention\nof getting a degree, and\ntherefore socialising is\nsimply not as important.\nImperial is, primarily,\nan institution built for\nacademic purposes - its\nprimary selling point is\nits academic rigour (if\nyou wanted an easier\nride you\u2019d be at UCL).\n\u201cPassengers like you. You won\u2019t feel like you\u2019re in China...\u201d// South China Morning Post\n\u201cWhat makes\ndiversity\nfulfilling and\nenriching is\nour cultural\ndifferences\u201d\nprospects, and wouldn\u2019t\nit be even greater for our\ncollective student experience if one of these\nother purposes were to\nmeet new, interesting\npeople from diverse\nbackgrounds? Having a\nmore cohesive student\nbody would certainly\nmake some decisions\neasier for the Union;\nhow can they improve\nthe experience of the\ntypical Imperial student\nwhen... there isn\u2019t one?\nIn that case, how do we\nbridge a cultural gap that\nintimidates most from\neven attempting to cross\nit? Is it even possible,\nor necessary, to force\npositive interracial\nrelationships? Doesn\u2019t\nthe individual have\nthe freedom to interact\nand make friends with\nwhoever they want?\nWhat we see is a situation that the College\ncannot solely be relied\nupon to improve; effort\nfrom the student body\nis overwhelmingly the\nmost effective solution.\nHaving different\ntypes of friendships for\ndifferent functions is\nnecessary for healthy\nsocial integration \u2013 a\nclose group of co-na-tional friends with\nwhom you are culturally\ncompatible; friends\nfrom the host country\n(UK) can ease the adjustment of international\nstudents to the host environment and culture;\nfriends from abroad can\nincrease cultural agility\nand awareness of global\naffairs of home students\nwithout them having to\nleave the country.\nI read a study on how\nthe social experience in a\npredominantly white US\nuniversity is impacted\nby race, where nonwhite students described\nthe challenge of \u201cfitting\nin to a White campus\nand community without\nbecoming \u201cWhite\u201d. For\nImperial, where no race\nmajority exists (home\nstudents make up less\nthan 50% of the student\nbody) it\u2019s possible the\nchallenge faced by\nstudents here is a fear\nof losing their sense of\nbelonging to wherever\nthey come from.\nNaturally, over time,\nstudents will gradually\nadopt a sense of belonging at Imperial. It\u2019s\npossible that creating a\nnon-judgemental, welcoming environment for\nstudents to step into on\ntheir first day will help.\nWhile I understand international students face\nmany hurdles in struggling to find their place\nin a new environment\n(which also applies to\nhome students), I do\nnot think international\nstudents should feel\nthat the language and\ncultural barriers they\nface are unbreakable;\nthey do not need to be\nseen as unsurmountable.\nUltimately, there is\nno need to become less\n\u2018Chinese (or whatever\nrace)\u2019 to build meaning-ful, wholesome relationships with people from\nelsewhere. There is no\nshame in speaking with\nan accent, or in taking\na few more seconds to\nfind the vocabulary you\nwant to express yourself.\nThere\u2019s no reason to\nfeel like you can\u2019t integrate if you don\u2019t get\ndry British humour or\nwestern pop-culture; you\nshouldn\u2019t feel awkward\nasking what that strange\nslang word was. What\nmakes diversity fulfilling and enriching is\nour cultural differences.\nEmbrace and contribute\nto the vibrancy of this\ndiversity, share with us\nthe humour and slang of\nyour culture.\nEven so, wouldn\u2019t\nit be better still if\nstudents came here\nwith purposes beyond\nmerely advancing career\n\n"

The choir frequently breaks down into\nsteps which looked like\nfreestyle dancing, their\nmovements seemingly\neffortless and enjoyable.\nThe casts\u2019 enthusiasm is\ncontagious, so much that\nI could see members of\nthe audience tapping their\nknees with the beat, with\nme too wanted to get up\nand join the singing and\ndancing.\nDespite all the songs\nsung in Zulu, the audience\nwas able to connect\nwith the themes by the\nexaggerated movements,\nexpressions, music and\nbackground. Homesickness, joy of coming back\nhome and accepting\nthose who\u2019ve left were\nthe subjects of the dance.\nBeing an international\nstudent, I could relate to\nthese sentiments (exam\nseason being a particularly difficult time of the\nyear for all of us).\nthe show in Holborn, it\nis safe to assume that the\nmajority of the audience\ndid not understand the\nZulu lyrics, but nonethe-less, the philosophy of\ncross-cultural collaboration through the arts,\nand unity was effectively\ndelivered and appreciated\nby the viewers.\nAs the sun rose and\nset, and the city scape\nexpanded, I was transported from urban London to\nthe vast plateaus of South\nAfrica closely bonded to\nnature. Natural sounds\nof crickets, wind and the\ntypical drums helped this,\nthe atmosphere seemed\ngenuine. Costumes compounded the authenticity\nof the show, whether\nthis be by the traditional\nkurtas of the choir or the\ntribal skirts with animal-istic head gear worn by\nthe dancers. The curled\nspines, stiff crawling\nmovements coupled with\nelegant pirouettes came\ntogether in a beautiful\namalgamation of cultures\nand styles (in particular\nballet and contemporary\ndance), making this show\nsuch a unique and beautiful sight.\nWhat was especially\nbeautiful about the show\nwas how it celebrated\nnon-conformity and diversity by incorporating a\ndiverse cast. Each dancer\nis of different built and\ndancing background.\nUnlike the original\nLadysmith Black Mambazo\u2019s music to INALA,\nthe Soweto gospel choir\nadds female singers to the\nchoir, expanding the vocal\ntextures and bringing\nmore breadth of newness.\nCoordination was inconsequential even in group\nnumbers, evident from the\naforementioned improvi-sations. Clearly set apart,\nthe choir and dancers\nhad their own numbers,\nbut they shared the same\nspace, one group setting\nup the scene for the next\n(dancers literally moving\nstumps for the choir to\nsit on and the choir in\nturn sharing umbrellas or\nseats with them). This coexistence was beautifully\nbalanced with song and\ndance.\nAlthough the show\nhonoured the free spirit\nand celebrated individ-uality, aspects of group\nperformances lacked\ncoordination, and were\nperformed half-heartedly\ndespite the otherwise aura\nof merriment. There was\na certain disorganisation\nas dancers and the choir\nshuffled onto the stage\ntowards the end of the\nfirst act, the artists seemed\nto tire. Nevertheless, the\ntirelessness was managed\nby the impetus of the\nsecond act, tugging at\nheartstrings.\nDance and song combine in this heart-warming homage to individuality.\nNahum McLean, Adelene Stanley and Jason Tucker in INALA //Johan Persson\nISSUE 1721\nFELIX\n15\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nDisha Bandyopadhyay\nArts Writer\nWhere?

The policies\nwere incredibly successful in providing economic\nrelief and financial reform\nthrough public work\nprojects, laying the foundation for the upcoming\nera of Democratic Party\nmajority in Congress; in\nessence, it upheld the idea\nthat real freedom can only\nbe achieved with economic security.\nThe Green New Deal\n(GND) is a 21st\nCentury\nremake of these princi-ples; it couples the aim\nof sweeping socioeconomic reform with the\nmost urgent crisis of\nmodern day: curbing our\ncarbon footprint to avoid\nirreparable damage to\nthe Earth.\nThe idea that these\ntwo aims could be\ntackled in a single effort\nwas first conceived in\n2007 in the UK, in customary British fashion\n\u2013 in a pub. It was\naround the time of the\nglobal financial crash,\nand economists Larry\nElliot and Colin Hines\nconjectured that a set of\ntrailblazing policies like\nthe New Deal would be\nneeded to fix the state of\nthe world. It came close\nto entering mainstream\npolitics in both the US\nand UK, supported by\nboth Gordon Brown and\nBarack Obama, but did\nnot gain enough traction\nfor it to be officially\nsupported by either es-tablishment. Then, when\nLabour lost government\nin 2009 and when the\nDemocrats lost hold\nof Congress in 2010,\nthe discussion of it in\npolitics virtually disap-peared, especially for\nthe UK, where a decade\nof austerity (which is\nthe antithesis of what\nthe GND stands for)\nwould soon begin. Most\nrecently it was brought\nback into public attention by US House Representative Alexandria\nOcasio-Cortez (AOC)\nand Senator Ed Markey.\nThe GND Deal\nproposed by AOC and\nMarkey, however, has\nevolved immeasurably from the original\nproposed in 2007. The\ndocument itself is a list\nof goals, collectively\ncalled the \u201cGreen New\nDeal\u201d, that they hope the\ngovernment will orient\nfuture policies towards.\nThese goals includes:\n\u2022 Reducing the net\nemission of greenhouse\ngas to zero;\n\u2022 100% reliance\non clean, renewable\nenergy to supply all of\nUS\u2019 electricity;\n\u2022 S w i t c h i n g\nthe auto industry to\nzero-emission electric\nvehicles;\n\u2022 A d d r e s s i n g\nhistorical and current\noppression of indigenous communities,\ncommunities of color,\nmigrant communities,\ndeindustrialized com-munities, depopulated\nrural communities,\nthe poor, low-income\nworkers, women, the\nelderly, the unhoused,\npeople with disabilities,\nand youth;\n\u2022 G u a r a n t e e i n g\nemployment with a\nfamily-sustaining wage,\nadequate family and\nmedical leave, paid va-cations, and retirement\nsecurity\nThese goals, each\nalready bold and colossal\nwhen viewed in isola-tion, were condensed\ninto a single resolution,\nwith an aim of achieving\neach one of them in 10\nyears\u2019 time. It seemingly\ntried to encompass any\nimaginable problem\nthat any imaginable\nUS citizen may face; it\nlooks and sounds like a\ntheory of everything.\nUnsurprisingly, it\nbecame a popular target\nfor conservatives, who\nargue that the Green\nNew Deal is more of\na socialist project that\nwants to rid American\ncapitalism disguised as\na climate resolution.\nThe GND proposed by\nAOC was a non-bind-ing resolution, even if\nthe resolution receives\napproval it does not\nlegally commit them to\nthese goals. But exactly\nhow the Deal should be\ninterpreted, as a manifesto of what progressives hope to achieve or\nas a legitimate proposal\nfor future legislation,\nseemed ambiguous to\nthe public and even to\npoliticians themselves.\nDespite the impression of failure the\nnumbers may give,\nbeneath the ostensible\nnumbers the Green New\nDeal is considered as far\nfrom defeat as we are\nfrom Andromeda. The\nstrategic logic of the\nGND reveals the hidden\nbrilliance of it, and helps\nus understand the Senate\nvote, or any future vote\non it, is not a proper\nmeasure of its success.\nIt is the epitome of bad\npolicy but good politics.\nIts success can be\nseen through the rapid\nbandwagon effect of\nmajor 2020 Democratic\npresidential candidates\nendorsing, and some\neven co-sponsoring, the\ndeal. It succeeded in\nbringing climate change\nto the political calculus,\nan issue that both parties\nwill now consider as indispensable when trying\nto win over millennials.\nThe Democratic Party\nin past years has tried\nunsuccessfully to bring\nclimate change to the\ntable in an inside-out\napproach. Their attempt\nto spread the message\nthrough business\nleaders and centris\nfailed because of the\ndiminishing existence of\nmoderate Republicans,\nsomething that drove\nthe Democratic Party\nto water down their\nproposals. The logic\nof the GND was to do\nthe opposite, to break\nthe gridlock from the\noutside in, and gain political attention through\nan unyielding grass\nroots movement run by\nthe youth.\nThe American political system has long been\nunder gridlock \u2013 passing\nnew legislation, no\nmatter how incremental\nthe change proposed, is\nchallenging. Faced with\na predicament where\nthe default change is no\nchange at all, and given\nthe urgency and gravity\nof climate change, only\na resolution as overambitious as the proposed\nGMZ can disrupt the\ncurrent balance of\npower. The goals of the\ndeal may be far-fetched\nand improbable, but\nthere\u2019s nothing to lose\nwhen the only alternative is nothing.\nBut the incorporation of socioeconomic\nreform for a movement\nfocused primarily in\nclimate change is not\njust for flair, it is nec-essary. When proposing\na complete overhaul\nof industries and a\nthorough transformation\nof the energy economy,\nthe financial securities\nand lifestyles of citizens\nmust be guaranteed for\nthem to trust the government enough to make\nthe change.\nThough the GND\nseems to have as many\nfacets as there are 2020\nDemocratic presidential\ncandidates, it can be\ninvariably agreed that\nits overarching effect\nhas been a delineation\nof what a modern progressive would likely\ndemand. It seems to be\nmore like a manifesto, a\ngrand mission statement\nfor what values the\nprogressive left want to\nconstruct their society\naround.\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez// Wikimedia\n\u201cThe idea that\nthese two\naims could\nbe tackled\nin a single\neffort was first\nconceived in\n2007 in the UK,\nin customary\nBritish fashion\n- in a pub\u201d\nSenator Mitch McConnell, the leader\nof Republicans in the\nSenate and a wily political operator, seized on\nthis uncertainty and suggested that the Senate\nwill settle the issue\nthrough a vote, which\nwould force Democratic\nsenators into a binary\nchoice of \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019\nthat do not consider the\ndifferent ways the Deal\ncan be interpreted. To\navoid this, the leading\nDemocratic Senator\nChuck Schumer advised\nDemocratic senators\nto abstain from voting,\nresulting in a 57-0 result\n(where 57 voted against\nthe bill) from a house of\n100 senators.\n\n"

There is always an\nelement of luck involved,\nbut how well you put\ntogether your app (and the\nbusiness framework that\nsupports it) is ultimately\nwhat will separate your\nidea from others. Your\nidea should have a USP\n(Unique Selling Point),\nor better yet, multiple\nUSPs. This does not mean\nthat your idea has to be\ncompletely novel; it might\nfor example involve a\ndifferent business model\nto competitors or be more\ncost effective.\nAlso think about your\nidea\u2019s lifespan.
