There will be a programme of invited talks\nfrom early stage research-ers, as well as a faculty of\ninternationally renowned\nscientists. Topics covered\nin this year\u2019s conference\nwill include:\n\u2022 Neurodegeneration and TBI: Prof. John\nHardy\n\u2022 Advances in neu-roimaging: Prof. David\nSharp\n\u2022Sports and military\nTBI\n\u2022 Paediatric TBI\nThis year we are introducing a podium poster\npresentation session\nfor a selection of the\ntop submissions for the\nconference. Quick-fire\npresentations (~5min)\nwill allow a wide range\nof submitted work to be\nhighlighted. This is an\nexcellent opportunity for\nearly career researchers\nto showcase their latest\nwork.\nFITBI 2017 included\ntwo lively interactive\ndebates (available online\nhttps://goo.gl/Th4qr8).\nMark Wilson & Ian\nWalker debated whether\ncycling helmets should be\ncompulsory. David Sharp\n& Lee Goldstein clashed\nover whether \u2018concussion\u2019\nis a term best consigned to\nretirement.Thesewasvery\nentertaining and similar\ndebates will be included\nin this programme.\nThis will be a dynamic\nand intimate conference,\nsmall enough to facilitate\nnetworking and the formation of new collabora-tions. Abstract submission\nfor the poster competition\nand Early Bird registration will be open until the\n26th\nof May (\u00a3180/\u00a3130\nstudents/trainees).\nFor more information\nand how to register,\nplease visit: www.fron-tiersintbi.org\n@FrontiersinTBI\nC3NL\nResearch Group\nSmells like Quantum?\nCan physics provide a solution to an age-old biological question?\nSCIENCE\nJonathan Davies\nScience Writer\nI\nn recent years, science has given us\nincredible insights\ninto the way our\nuniverse works: we have\nsequenced the entire\nhuman genome, broken\nmatter into the most\nfundamental building\nblocks, and looked back\nto the seconds following\nthe Big Bang. You might\nthink that by now we\nwould have answered\nsimple questions such as\n\u2018how exactly does smell\nfunction?\u2019; however, you\nmay be surprised to know\nthat academics are still\nunsure as to the precise\nmechanics of one of our\nfive basic senses.\nThis problem is\nslightly more complex\nthan you might think. A\nsimple view one might\nhave would be that when\nsmelling a substance, a\nchemical reaction of some\nsort may occur, whose\nproducts in some way\ntriggers a neurological\nresponse.\nConsider limonene:\n(S)-limonene smells of\nlemon, while its mirror\nimage (R)-limonene\nsmells of oranges. Consequently, researchers began\nto investigate, and this led\nto the development of the\n\u201clock-and-key\u201d hypoth-esis, which states if the\nreceptors are presumed\nto work as locks, only a\ncomplementary key (or\nodorant molecule) of\nexact shape would bind\nand trigger a response.\nThis sheds some light\nto the above example. The\ntwo mirror images (also\nknown as \u201cenantiomers\u201d)\nof limonene have slightly\ndifferent shapes and so\nwill bind to different\nreceptors, and thus will\nsmell differently. Fans of\nmurder mysteries may be\nable to spot a fundamental flaw in this theory.\nUsing the example of\ncyanide (which has a very\ncharacteristic almond\nsmell due to the chemical\nbenzaldehyde), the two\nenantiomers of this molecules have very different\nshapes yet smell almost\nidentical. Furthermore,\nthere is also the issue of\nthe fact that the sense of\nsmell is incredibly selec-tive, as indicated by the\norange-lemon example.\n\u201cA number\nof examples\nshow the lock-and-key model\nis not correct\nfor our sense\nof smell\u201d\nThe proteins in our\nnose, however, are prone\nto \u2018non-specific binding\u2019\nsuch that if the key is not\na direct fit, binding would\nstill occur. In a recent\ninvestigation, bees were\nable to tell the difference\nbetween two versions of\nthe same molecule, with\ndeuterium substituted for\nhydrogen in one of the\nodorants.\nHereafter, physical\nchemists decided to take\non this problem. This\nquestion is one of many\nin recent years where\nscientists have turned to\nquantum mechanics to\nexplain a peculiar process.\nIn this case, the suggested\nculprit was \u2018quantum\ntunnelling\u2019 which forms\nthe basis of what is known\nas \u2018the vibrational theory\nof olfaction.\u2019\nThe theory indicates\nthat the way in which we\nclassify odorants is by\ntheir chemical bonds. For\ninstance, molecules containing hydrogen-sulphur\nbonds all seem to smell of\nrotten eggs, irrespective\nof their shape.\nThe model states that\nupon smelling, electrons\npass between energy\nlevels in neighbouring\natoms within our scent\nreceptors, thus stimulating signals that are sent\nto our brains. The energy\ndifference between these\nlevels is greater than the\nenergy that the electron\npossesses itself.\nClassically, these\ntransitions would be pro-hibited, but in quantum\nmechanics there is a\nprobability that electrons\ncan make these seemingly\nimpossible jumps. This\nis made possible by a\nprocess known as \u2018inelastic quantum tunnelling\u2019.\nIn order for this to\ntake place, the electron\nmust offload a precise\namount of energy, which\nis only possible if there\nis something there to\nabsorb the energy, such\nas a molecular bond. Tunnelling will only occur if\nthe vibrational frequency\nof the molecular bond is\nexactly the right value to\nabsorb the electron\u2019s of-floaded energy. We therefore have a mechanism\nthrough which our noses\ncan distinguish different\nsmells by their bonding,\nrather than their shape.\nThe problem, it seems has\nbeen solved.\nNot so fast! We have\nalready seen that our noses\ncan differentiate between\nenantiomers of the same\nmolecule, but the vibrational theory in no way\naccounts for this. Thus,\nthe model might be a bit\nmore complicated than\nfirst thought. Some have\nsuggested that in \u2018combination modes\u2019 where\nthe molecule not only\nvibrates but also twists,\ntunnelling properties may\nvary sufficiently between\nenantiomers enabling\nthem to be distinguished..\nUnfortunately, it has\nbeen found that this\nprocess only works for\na handful of molecules,\nas electron tunnelling\nis heavily dependent on\npressure and temperature.\nHigher pressures result in\nthe molecules ceasing vi-bration, as they constantly\ncollide with other mole-cules. This implies that\nbeyond a certain pressure\nwe should stop being able\nto smell.\nThe two competing\ntheories appear to have\nreached a standstill in\ntheir ability to explain this\neveryday phenomenon.\ndue to the process it is\nthought to be analogous\nto, which is exactly how\ncredit card machines\noperates.\nFirstly, the card must\nbe the correct thickness\nto physically fit in the\nmachine and secondly, the\ninformation encoded on\nthe card is electromagnet-ically read. The process\nmay be similar in olfaction whereby the odorant\nis first identified by its\nshape, by binding to a\ncomplementarily-shaped\nreceptor, and then is\nclassified by its chemistry\nthrough electron tunnel-ling.\nThistheorystillrequires\nmuch work; however,\nmany individuals in the\nfield are convinced that\nwe are on the brink of\nfinally being able to truly\nunderstand one of the\nkey facets of the human\nsensory experience!\nIt seems that the realm\nof physics, much derided\nfor its lack of applicability\nin the modern world may\nyet offer answers to the\nmost real-life of questions.\n\u201cThe two\ncompeting\ntheories\nhave been\ncombined into\nthe\u2018swipecard\u2019model\u201d\nOne solution to this\nis obvious \u2013 combine\nboth theories into one.\nThe \u2018swipe-card\u2019 model\nhas recently risen in\npopularity to become the\nleading hypothesis for the\ntrue nature of smell. It is\nthought that an odorant\nencodes information\nabout its smell in both\nits shape and molecular\nbonds.\nThe model is so-called\nSCIENCE\n\u201cIt\u2019s an\nexcellent\nopportunity\nfor researchers\nto showcase\ntheir latest\nwork\u201d\n\u2022 Functional disorders and TBI: Dr. Alan\nCarson\n\u2022 Computerised\ncognitive assessment and\ntraining: Dr Adam Hampshire\n\u2022 Disorders of\nconsciousness: Dr Srivas\nChennu & Dr Davina\nFernandez-Espejo\n\u2022 N o n - i n v a s i v e\nbrain stimulation: Dr\nLucia Li\n\u2022 Pre-hospital care:\nProf. Mark Wilson\n\u2022 Computational\nmodelling of TBI: Dr\nMazdak Ghajari\nStop and smell the flowers // Wikimedia\nNew Year, New News!\nFelix are setting up a weekly newsletter, delivered\nstraight to your inbox.

She seemed\nto suggest that courses\nwould charge variable\namounts depending on\ntheir earning potential, a\nposition later backed up\nby Education Secretary\nDamian Hinds.\nA major review of\nfunding in higher education was promised by the\nConservatives last May,\nas part of their election\nmanifesto. The move\ncame amid increasing\nconcern over the amount\nof debt faced by students\nin higher education, and\nChanges to graduation seating put in place\nLondon may have to\nsit apart, under a new\nticketing system put in\nplace.\nThis year the responsibility of the ticketing\nand seating allocation\nwill be taken over from\nCollege by the Royal\nAlbert Hall. The College\ntold Felix: \u201ctheir professional systems are better\nequipped to manage an\nevent of this scale, which\nwill lead to an easier ticketing process and a better\noverall experience on the\nday.\u201d\nHowever, the change\nmeans students attending\nwith more than two guests\nwill have no guarantee\nthe guests will be sitting\ntogether. Graduands are\nguaranteed two guest\ntickets, with the option to\npurchase more on a first\ncome first served basis at\na later date. While in previous years the College\u2019s\nmanual system would\nseat these guests together,\nunder the new system this\nis not guaranteed.\nOne student Felix\nspoke to, who is due to\ngraduate from the Royal\nAlbert Hall later this year,\nsaid they were \u201csaddened\nto find out my parents and\nmy partner will not be\nsitting next to each other\nat my graduation.\u201d\n\u201cI understand that with\nthe increasing number of\ngraduands some changes\nneed to be made for the\nceremonies to be sustain-able. However, I still do\nnot fully understand why\nseating places are not\nallocated after sales. If\ndoing it manually is not\nefficient, why not make\nit an Imperial project\nto fix it? It would be a\ngood UROP project, for\nexample\u201d\n\u201cI would love to have\nmy parents and my partner\nsit together, considering\nthey were both instrumental to my success during\nmy degree. I think a better\nsolution exists, and this\nnew system is not it.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the\nCollege told Felix: \u201cWhile\nwe cannot guarantee that\nadditional ticket-holders\nwill be seated with the\noriginal party, students\nshould contact the Royal\nAlbert Hall Box Office\nto discuss options should\ntheir additional ticket(s)\nrequest be successful.\nWhere possible the Royal\nAlbert Hall will do their\nbest to accommodate\nthese requests.\u201d\nThis year\u2019s postgraduate graduation ceremony\nwill be held on the 2nd\nMay, 2018.\nthe long-term sustainability of the current model.\nCurrently, students leave\nuniversity with \u00a350,000\ndebt on average.\nThe review, which is\nchaired by Philip Augar,\nis set to run for a year.\nMay\u2019s speech contained\nsuggestions at what possible outcomes might be.\nOne of the most controversial plans would be to\nintroduce variable fees for\ndifferent courses, based\non a number of factors,\nincluding the value the\ncourse has to the UK\neconomy. In her speech,\nMay said \u201cthe level of\nfees charged do not relate\nto the cost or quality of\nthe course.\u201d\nThis suggestion was\nsupported by Hinds.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio\n4\u2019s Today programme,\nhe said \u201cThere are different considerations for\ncourses. There is the cost\nto put it on, there\u2019s the\nreturn to the individual,\nand there\u2019s also the return\nto our economy and to\nsociety as a whole.\u201d\nIf variable fees are\nintroduced, it is likely\nthat non-STEM subjects,\nwhich have lower graduate earning potential, will\nend up charging less for\ncourses.\nThe move has attracted\ncriticism from a number\nof sectors. Justine Greening, the former Education\nMinister, who was replaced earlier this year,\nsuggested that changes\nwould not do much to\nimpact social mobility,\nand expressed concern\nthat they may end up with\n\u201ca system where young\npeople from more disadvantaged backgrounds\nfeel like they ought to\ndo one of the cheaper\ndegrees.\u201d\nAngela Rayner, the\nshadow education secre-tary, said: \u201ccharging more\nfor the courses that help\ngraduates earn the most\nwould put off students\nfrom the most disadvantaged backgrounds from\ngetting these same qualifications.\u201d\nRichard Adams, The\nGuardian\u2019s education\neditor, said the move\nwas \u201cclear, simple, and\nwrong\u201d, pointing out that\nsome courses with the\nhighest graduate earning\npotential were the cheapest to run, citing economics courses at institutions\nlike LSE.\nThere are also concerns\nover the impact dropping\ntuition fees could have:\nan analysis by the London\nEconomics consultancy\nfirm has predicted that\ndropping fees to \u00a36,000\nacross all courses would\nlead to a deficit of \u00a31.169\nbillion per year.\nMay, who said her first\nspeech in parliament had\nbeen on education reform,\nsaid \u201cthe need for [a new\neducation system] has\nnever been greater\u201d\nOne outcome the government has made it clear\nthey will not support,\nhowever, is complete\nremoval of tuition fees, a\npromise Labour made in\nthe run up to last year\u2019s\ngeneral election. Speaking in Derby, May said:\n\u201cthose who benefit directly from higher education\nshould contribute directly\ntowards the cost of it.\u201d \u2013 a\nclear swipe at Labour\u2019s\npolicy.\nTuition fees have been\na point of contention\nfor the government for\na number of years. In\n2010, the cap of \u00a33,225\nwas raised to \u00a39,000 per\nyear, which sparked large\nstudent protests. Initially,\nthe government had\npredicted that a handful\nof the top-performing\nuniversities would raise\ntheir tuition fees to the\nmaximum level, but the\nvast majority of higher education institutions now\ncharge maximum fees.\nIn October, May announced plans to freeze\ntuition fees at a maximum\nof \u00a39,250 per year, and\nraisethethresholdatwhich\nloans must be paid back to\n\u00a325,000. Originally, the\ngovernment had planned\nto link rises in tuition fees\nwith the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF);\nuniversities with gold and\nsilver ratings would have\nbeen able to raise their\nfees in line with inflation.\nMay also spoke about\nthe challenges faced by\nstudents from lower socioeconomic backgrounds,\nhighlighting that nearly\n25% of students at top universities went to private\nschool. Newly-released\ndata showed Imperial was\namong the worst-perform-ing universities in the UK\nin terms of state school\nadmission, with only\n63.5% of intake last year\nfrom state schools.\nTheresa May, lost in thought about tuition fees // Wikimedia\nTheresa May announces tuition fee review\nFELIX\nNEWS\nChanges to the system\nmean guests may\nnot necessarily sit\ntogether.\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nG\nuests of students attending graduation\nc e r e m o n i e s\nat Imperial College\nFRIDAY, 23RD\nFEBRUARY, 2018 FELIX\nEDITORIAL\nThe Felix Team\nEditor-in-Chief\nFred Fyles\n\u2022\nDeputy Editor\nJoanna Wormald\n\u2022\nNews Editors\nJoanna Wormald\n\u2022\nPolitics Editors\nAvirup Banerjee\nDivyen Vanniasegaram\n\u2022\nComment Editors\nAlan Perfect\nCharlie Titmuss\n\u2022\nScience Editor\nRosie Dutt\n\u2022\nTech Editor\nTom Mrazek\n\u2022\nArts Editors\nIndira Mallik\nJJ Cheng\nAdam Gellatly\n\u2022\nBooks Editors\nJJ Cheng\nAlice Peberdy\n\u2022\nMusic Editors\nAndy Djaba\nAdrian LaMoury\nHenry Eshbaugh\n\u2022\nFilm Editors\nMikhail Demtchenko\nAshley Luckyram\nMark Aduol\nMichael Purdy\n\u2022\nTV Editor\nAndrew Melville\n\u2022\nFood Editors\nChun Yuan Hii\nAlice Davage\nAndrada Balmez\n\u2022\nTravel Editor\nEdita Pileckyte\n\u2022\nPuzzles Editor\nHamish Beck\n\u2022\nSports Editor\nImraj Singh\n\u2022\nHead Photographer\nJoseph O'Connell-Danes\n\u2022\nCopy Editors\nAlex Adler\nAsh Pattar\nAstrid Zong\nSelin Olenik\nRhidian Thomas\nEzgi Ozyilkan\nMyles Lee\nHari Choudhury\nCONTENTS\nEDITORIAL\nNEWS\nPOLITICS\nCOMMENT\nSCIENCE\nTECH\nARTS\nBOOKS\nGAMES\nMUSIC\nFILM\nLIBERATION\nFOOD\nTRAVEL\nC&S\nHANGMAN\nPUZZLES\nSPORTS\n2\n3-6\n7\n8-11\n13-15\n16\n17-19\n21-22\n23\n26-27\n28-31\n33\n34\n35-36\n38-39\n40-41\n42\n44-48\nFelix Office\nBeit Quad, Prince Consort\nRoad\nLondon, SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 79548072\nEmail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nfelixonline.co.uk\n@feliximperial\nPrinted by Mortons Media\nGroup, Boston Road,\nHorncastle, Lincolnshire\nRegistered Newspaper\nISSN 1040-0711\nCopyright (c) Felix 2017\nLife on the picket lines\nT\nhis Thursday, the\nstriking Imperial\ne m p l o y e e s ,\nabove all, looked\ncold. Walking into university at what I thought\nwas the punctual time of\n8.55am, I passed people\nwho\u2019d been standing on\nthe picket line since just\nafter 7am, passing out\nleaflets to passersby, and\nslowly losing all the feeling from their hands. It\ntakes dedication, it seems,\nto take part in a strike,\nparticularly on a bitter\nFebruary morning, when\nyou could easily nip into\na warm classroom.\nBut what was even\nmore impressive, for me\npersonally, was seeing the\nstudents who came out\nto support the strikers on\nthe picket lines, carrying\nplacards and wearing\nUCU armbands. Imperial\noften has a reputation, not\nonly for \u2018world-renowned\nresearch\u2019, but also for\na complete and distinct\nlack of getting involved in\npolitics. Whether people\nfeel they\u2019re too busy with\ntheir coursework to get\ninvolved with activism, or\nthink the research they do\nexists in a vacuum, with\nno impact on the messy\nworld of policy (spoiler:\nit doesn\u2019t), students here\nseem reluctant to engage.\nThings were different\ntoday. It might have been\na long time coming, but\nthe swell of support from\nstudents who turned\nout this morning felt\nlike something of a sea\nchange. I\u2019ve been at\nImperial since 2012, and\nthe last time I remember\nstudents getting this\ninvolved with a campaign\nwas when #againstacton\nwas launched, to protest\nCollege purchasing\nstudent accomodation\noutside zone 1 (spoiler:\nit didn\u2019t work). That was\nover five years ago, and\nsince then I\u2019ve witnessed\n\u2013 and been part of \u2013 a\nstudent body who seem to\nshy away from politics.\nWhat is it about these\nstrikes that could mark\nthe turning point? Maybe\nit\u2019s because students are\nseeing the direct effect it\u2019s\nhaving on their education,\nhaving to forego previous\ntime in tutorials in lectures\nafter staff have joined the\npicket line. Or maybe\nit\u2019s because they believe\nthat \u2013 when universities\ntreat them like consumers \u2013 they are entitled to\na refund since they\u2019re\nmissing out on expensive\nsupervision. Or maybe\nit\u2019s just because the whole\nworld of politics has been\ngoing to shit the last few\nyears, and we\u2019re starting\nto make ourselves heard.\nWhatever the cause,\nthe effect was seen\nthis morning, as I and\nFelix photographer Joe\nfollowed the procession of\nstudents as they made their\nway up to the Blue Cube\nFaculty Building, leaving\nmessages of support while\nmanagement staff looked\non. The atmosphere was\none of elation, tempered\nby a palpable rage at\nwhat the striking workers\nwere facing: an uncertain\nfinancial future as their\npension scheme risks\nbeing completely altered.\nSpeaking to those taking\npart in the demonstration,\nit was clear that \u2013 while\nwe might moan about\ncoursework deadlines and\nSCR breakfasts \u2013 many\nof us feel a lasting connection to our lecturers,\ntutors, and support staff.\nThe strike will be continuing for the next few\nweeks, and I urge all of\nyou to not let this opportunity slip through your\nfingers. They are fighting\nfor their future, and, by\nextension, the future of all\nof us \u2013 whether we want\nto go into academia or\nnot. Now, more than ever,\nis the time to turn up, and\nget involved.\nFred Fyles \u2013 Felix Editor\n2\nFelix is recruiting!\nWewantyou\u2013yes,you!We\u2019relookingforwriters,photographers,editors,illustrators,reporters,\ncomputer experts and grammar nerds to join our team.

Love\nand attention?\u201d\nChristine \u201cLady Bird\u201d\nMcPherson (Saoirse\nRonan) is in her last\nyear of high school, at\na catholic institution in\nthe city of Sacramento,\nCalifornia. Her dream,\nlike innumerable other\nteens across the states of\nAmerica, is to get as far\naway from her surroundings as possible; a liberal\narts college on the East\nCoast would offer her just\nthe escape she is seeking.\nTaking place across\nSenior Year in the early\n2000s, we see Lady\nBird pick up and drop\nboyfriends, best friends,\nhouses, pastimes, and\nnames, as she tries to\nfigure out her place in\nthe world. What remains\nconstant, however, is\nher relationship with her\nmother Marion (Laurie\nexemplifies what often\noccurs between parents\nand late adolescents, who\nare itching to leave the\nfamily nest.\nGerwig cut her teeth in\nthe world of screenwriting\nwith mumblecore films\nand collaborations with\nNoah Baumbach, such\nas Mistress America and\nFrances Ha. But while\nthose previous films\nrelied on a breezy, screw-ball-esque energy associated with their New York\nsettings, in Lady Bird\nGerwig has opted for a\nmore naturalistic, relaxed\ntone; it\u2019s more intimate,\nmore nuanced, and \u2013 dare\nI say it \u2013 more enjoyable\nthan her previous work.\nIt can be difficult, when\nwatching Lady Bird, to\nremember that this is\nGerwig\u2019s first turn alone\nin the director\u2019s chair.\nHer direction is calm and\nassured, and you could\neasily be watching the\nwork of someone at the\nheight of their creative\npowers, rather than\nsomebody just starting\nout on what is hopefully a\nlengthy directorial career.\nShe handles complex\ntopics with a gentle grace\nand even-handedness,\nwhich belies the emotional power of the film as a\nwhole.\nOne of the most impressive aspects of the\nfilm is how it deals with\nthe city of Sacramento,\nwhere Gerwig was born\nand brought up. While\nthe setting of Lady Bird\ncertainly impacts on the\nnature of the film, Gerwig\nnever allows the time or\nplace to overshadow the\nnarrative. References to\ntheearlynoughtiesabound\nin the film, but always\nindirectly \u2013 Gerwig builds\nup her own image of\nSacramento through small\ndetails, and the result is a\nsense of setting that gets\ndeep into the viewer\u2019s\nbones. Lady Bird shows\nus how where we grow up\nnever really leaves us, for\nbetter or worse, and that\nan appreciation for our\nhome towns often appears\nafter we\u2019ve left to greener\npastures.\nWhat Lady Bird\nskewers particularly well,\nin my opinion, is the\nexperience of growing up\nas a member of the struggling American working\nclass, and the feelings\nof inferiority such an\nupbringing generates\nin Lady Bird when she\ncompares herself to her\nmore well-off classmates.\nWhile Lady Bird\u2019s family\nare by no means living in\npoverty, the film bombards\nus with plot elements \u2013\nshopping in thrift shops,\nsocks at Christmas \u2013 that\nhighlight both the momentous impact an East\nCoast college placement\ncould have on Lady Bird\u2019s\nfinances, and the distances\nher parents will go to keep\nthe family\u2019s head above\nwater.\nIt is this knowledge\nthat makes Lady Bird\u2019s\nrejection of what her\nupbringing offers that\nmuch more impactful.\nOf course, she is at an\nage when it is normal\nto reject what you\u2019re\noffered by your parents,\nbut what Lady Bird does\nexceptionally well is to\nshow us the effects such\nrejection can have. When\nLady Bird refers to her\nhouse as being \u2018on the\nwrong side of the tracks\u2019,\nfor example, it cuts deep\nto a mother who never\nexpected to be raising two\nkids there.\nLady Bird could easily\nbe just another coming-of-age drama, in which the\nprotagonist leaves behind\nher small-town upbringing\nfor bright lights in the city;\nbut thanks to Gerwig\u2019s\nbrilliant direction and\nwell-crafted script, Lady\nBird manages to be much\nmore than that.

Blind obedience\ncastrates, negates, hides,\nand destroys what makes\nus human.\u201d\nMore than a decade on\nfrom the film that made\nhis name in the world of\ncinema, he returns to the\nsame themes \u2013 those of\nchoice, duality, and the\nbattle between natural\nchaos and artificial order\n\u2013 in The Shape of Water,\na beautiful, twisted fairytale for our own age.\nAs usual with his\nfilms, del Toro asks us to\nsuspend right from the\noff any sense of disbelief\nthat may cling to us as we\nsettle in our seats. Starting\nwith a sequence in which\nthe camera floats weightless through an apartment\nbuilding flooded with\nwater, The Shape of Water\nis a sensory experience\n\u201cAs in his\nprevious films,\nany notion\nof whimsy is\nundercut by an\never-present\nsense of\nviolence\u201d\nlike no other; throughout\nthe two-hour runtime, del\nToro bombards us with\nimages and scenes of such\nbeauty and intensity that\nto leave the cinema seems\nlike an affront, since it\nnecessitates breaking the\ndelicate spell the film\nweaves.\nAs with Pan\u2019s Labyrinth, set in Franco\u2019s\nSpain, The Shape of Water\nis a film shaped by a strong\nsense of time and place:\nin this film the location is\nBaltimore, and the year\nis 1962. The Cold War\nis at its full height, racial\ndiscrimination is rife,\nand a mute woman called\nEliza (Sally Hawkins)\nworks as a cleaner at a\ntop secret government\nfacility. Her regular order\nis one day disrupted,\nwhen a new acquisition\nis brought into the laboratory by a glowering army\ncolonel called Strickland\n(Michael Shannon) \u2013 it\u2019s\nan amphibious humanoid,\nobtained from South\nAmerica, where it was\nworshiped as a god, and\nplayed with beautiful\nphysicality by regular del\nToro collaborator Doug\nJones.\nFrom the off, Eliza\nis captivated with the\ncreature; she begins a\nsilent courtship, teaching\nhim sign language and\nintroducing him to the\nmusic of Benny Goodman\nin a series of wonderful-ly-crafted scenes. But, of\ncourse, this cannot last.\nWith hopes the creature\ncould give them the edge\nneeded to succeed in the\nSpace Race, the government orders his vivisec-tion, and Eliza is forced\nto break him out \u2013 with\nthe help of her closeted\nneighbour Giles (Richard\nJenkins), Soviet spy Dr.\nHoffstetler (Michael\nStuhlbarg), and African-American co-worker\nZelda (Octavia Spencer).\nes the action. Del Toro\nis a director who knows\nthat desire and lust are but\ntwo aspects of the same\nobject, and this allows\nhim to keep his characters\nfrom floating away on a\nsense of whimsy.\nWhile there is ample\nacting talent in the supporting cast \u2013 Jenkins is\nparticularly excellent in\nhis role, all simmering\nanxiety and concealed\ntensions \u2013 the emotional\ncentre of the film is\nHawkins, whose performance as Eliza captivates.\nUnable to speak, she\nconveys her thoughts\nand feelings with subtle\nchanges to facial expressions and body language\n\u2013 a hard-won achievement\nthat she makes look effort-less. Her Eliza manages\nto be both free-floating\nand grounded, going\nfrom scenes where she\njoyfully dances around\nthe amphibian\u2019s tank, to\nconfronting Giles with\nsign language so pointed\nit revels her immense rage\nwith perfect ease.\nThe Shape of Water is,\nultimately, a film in thrall\nto the power of cinema,\nand the delicate but potent\nbeauty it can create. Del\nToro is clearly a director\nwho is so obviously in\nlove, both with his own\ncreations, and those that\ncame before him; The\nShape of Water is indebted\nto both classic musical\nnumbers of movies gone\nby and schlocky Universal Monsters from the\nB-movie era.\nIt\u2019s not a perfect film,\nby any means: some of\nthe plot elements don\u2019t\nquite gel together, with\nsome side-elements\nseeming superfluous; and\nthe links del Toro draws\nbetween sexuality, race,\nand disability can seem\nham-fisted. But ultimate-ly, The Shape of Water\nis best enjoyed with the\nsense of weightlessness\nthat comes through\nsuspension of over-anal-ysis; it\u2019s a hand-crafted\nfantasy-world, build by\na director who is at the\nheight of his powers, both\nin terms of creativity and\nscale. To interrogate it\ntoo deeply would destroy\nits magic; it would be a\nshame.\n\u201cSeems like I was both\nboth too early or too late\nfor my life,\u201d reflects Giles\nat one point \u2013 an illustrator living in a time of\nphotography; a gay man\nexisting during a period\nof hate. Luckily, for us,\nthis film has arrived at\nthe precise right moment:\nThe Shape of Water is del\nToro\u2019s world, and you\nshould take the time to\nlive in it, even for a little\nwhile.\nMichael Stuhlbarg, Sally Hawkins, and Doug Jones in The Shape of Water // Fox Searchlight\nFILM\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nDir: Guillermo del Toro.\nScript: Guillermo del Toro,\nVanessa Taylor.

Rogers last\nFriday published, along\nwith other scientists, his\nresearch on a wearable\nmicrofluidics sweat analytics device in the journal\nScience Advances. He is\nnow collaborating with\nmany partners such as\nGatorade, the Seattle\nMariners, and the U.S. Air\nForce to further develop,\ntest and bring the device\ninto wider distribution.\nThe device was initially\nintroduced in 2016 and,\nas the name suggests, it\nanalyses sweat and its biomarkers produced from\neccrine sweat glands with\nhigh accuracy and in real\ntime. Information about\nhydration levels is communicated to the user with\na simple visual read-out \u2013\nnothing fancy. The device\nis soft and flexible and it\nsits on the skin. It is a little\nlarger than a quarter coin\nand is roughly around the\nsame thickness as well.\nEarlier designs included\nmeasurements of chloride\nloss, glucose, lactate, and\npH levels in sweat.\nOver the past year and\na half, newer designs also\nmeasure concentrations of\nheavy metals such as lead\nand arsenic, along with\nurea and creatinine levels.\nThis device allows\npeople to monitor their\nsweat rate and electrolyte\nloss so that they can keep\nhydrated and replenish\ntheir electrolytes when\ndifferent compartments.\nIn those compartments\nthere are chemical\nreagents that react with\nthe sweat to produce\nvisible colour changes.\nThose colour changes\nrelate to concentration of\ndifferent substances like\nchloride or electrolytes.\n\u201cMost people want to\nknow if they are losing a\nlot of chloride, a little bit\nor almost none,\u201d Rogers\nsaid. \u201cThey can just\neyeball the device and determine if their electrolyte\nlevels are high, medium,\nor low.\u201d\nAunique aspect of these\ndevices is that they can\nmeasure the user\u2019s sweat\nunderwater, for instance\nneeded. It also provides\nreal-time information on\nhow their sweat chemistry\nchanges during the day\nor when doing a set of\nexercises.\n\u201cNow we have devices\nthat fill sequentially in\ntime. This is important\nbecause variations in\nsweat biomarkers give\na sense of fatigue level\nas you\u2019re exercising. We\ndidn\u2019t have that capability\npreviously,\u201d said Rogers.\nThe target consumers\nare widespread. Not only\ncan it be used on a daily\nbasis to monitor hydra-tion, it can also be used by\nathletes and military personnel as the information\nprovided will be detailed\nenough to suit their needs.\nIf a person is using the\ndevice while working\nout, however, this doesn\u2019t\nmean that they have to\npause their workout to\ncomprehend the information collected by the\ndevice. This is because\nsweat travels through the\nmicroscopic channels\nwithin the device and into\nduring aquatic sports.\nThis is achieved by using\nnew adhesive materials\nand microfluidic designs\nthat have water-tight\nseals. This ensures that\nonly sweat, and not water\nsurrounding the person,\nenters the microfluidic\nchannels. The sweat analytics system is now routinely used by the swim\nteam in Northwestern\nUniversity as it allows the\ncoach and the swimmers\nto be better informed on\nlevels of dehydration\nduring a practice session.\nJarod Schroeder, head\ncoach of Northwestern\u2019s\nmen\u2019s swimming team\nsaid: \u201cSkin-mounted\nmicrofluidic devices from\nthe Rogers group allow\nus, for the first time, to\ndetermine sweat and electrolyte loss continuously,\nas it occurs in the pool\nduring swimming, without\nany adverse impact on our\nathletes... The remarkably\nhigh levels of sweat loss\nthat occur in the pool\ndemands careful scheduling for rehydration.\u201d\nOne drawback of this\nsweat analytics system\nis that the information is\nprovided through colour\nchanges that the research\nteam claims qualitatively\nrelates to concentrations\nof different substances.\nThis raises the question of\nwhether the colours can be\nclearly distinguished by\npeople who have a certain\ntype of colour blindness,\nfor instance red-green\ncolour blindness.\nOther drawbacks are\nthat the device can only be\nused once for a few hours\nso the device isn\u2019t ideal\nfor activities that take up a\nlot of time. A person who\nuses it regularly would\nhave to keep buying these\nsystems as they use it up.\nDespite these dis-advantages, Epicore\nBiosystems, a start-up\nfounded by Rogers\u2019 group\nthrough Northwestern\u2019s\nInnovation and New\nVentures Office, has\nestablished large volume\nmanufacturing technologies for these microfluidic\nsystems. In the future,\nalong with making it low-cost, the company plans\nto co-package the systems\nwith products in related\nlines, for instance nutri-tion, skin health, cosmetics and sports hydration\nproducts. The company is\nalso planning on making\nthem usable in clinics and\nrehabilitation centers.\nGathering information from perspiration // Creative Commons\n\u201cThe sweat\nanalyser is soft\nand flexible,\nand it sits\nstraight on the\nskin\u201d\n\u201cThese\ndevices can\nmeasure the\nuser\u2019s sweat\nunderwater\u201d\n\u201cContained\nare reagents\nthat react\nwith sweat to\nproduce color\nchanges\u201d\n\n"

From my\nbrief time at this weekend\u2019s convention, I\u2019ll give\nyou my quick rundown of\nthe event and comment a\nbit about conventions in\ngeneral.\nThe convention was\nheld at a small complex\nowned by London Metropolitan University,\ntaking place over two\nmain floors. The lower\nfloor was more dimly\nlit \u00e0 la a nightclub with\na small stage, a bar and\na few stalls with games\nand handicraft products\non sale. There were also\nsome back rooms were\npeople could go and chill\nout. One such room had a\ncollection of retro gaming\nrigs set up with consoles\nsuch as the Nintendo 64,\nthe SEGA Genesis and\nthe PlayStation 2 (feel old\nyet?).\nThe upper room was\nlarger, with a bigger stage,\nmore seats and a larger\nvariety of stalls with an\neven larger collection of\ncolourful merchandise on\nsale. I\u2019d honestly say it\u2019s\nworth going, just to buy\n\u201cThe explosion\nof geek culture\nis a bit jarring\nat first, but it\u2019s\nsomething you\nwarm up to\u201d\n\u201cRick trying to\nsell his portal\ngun to DC\u2019s\nDeathstroke is\njust amazing\nto watch\u201d\nsome cool artwork, shirts\nand trinkets. However,\nwe\u2019re all on a student\nbudget here so make sure\nyou watch your wallet\nwhen you venture forth.\nCompared to MCMC\nComic Con held in May\nand October, this one\nwas smaller in scope\nand number of people.\nHowever, I personally\nthought that this worked\nout in its favour; it was\nnice to get a change of\npace from a more grandeur\nevent. For example, when\nthe karaoke event took\nplace, it felt like around\nhalf the attendees were\npresent. I know the more\nsocially awkward of you\nreaders will freak out\nat this but honestly, it\nmade the event feel more\nlike an intimate affair. It\nseemed like it was geared\ntowards being more social\nand interactive with other\nguests, another thing\nwhich you awkward peeps\nmay object to.\nOne thing that\u2019s noteworthy in any convention\nis the sheer amount of\ngeekiness you\u2019re exposed\nto. Seeing the explosion\nof geek culture is a bit\njarring at first, but it\u2019s\nsomething you warm up\nto. It\u2019s endearing to see so\nmany people, passionate\nabout their interests and\nhobbies, and generally\nbeing welcoming and\nnon-judgemental towards\neach other. The quality\nof cosplay is also a real\njoy to watch; as clich\u00e9\nas it sounds, it\u2019s like the\ncharacters have literally\njumped out of the screens\ninto real life.\nUnfortunately, I had a\nbusy weekend and was\nunable to hang around for\nthe full three day event,\nlet alone a full day for\nthat matter. Had I stuck\naround, there would have\nbeen a variety of different\nevents to take part in and\nhave some fun with. There\nwere gaming tournaments\non Saturday and Sunday\nover a wide selection of\ngames like Super Smash\nBrothers, Overwatch,\nLeague of Legends and\nmore. As an incentive to\ntake part, there were cash\nprizes, although to be\nfair, you\u2019d probably get\nwrecked by someone who\ntakes the game seriously.\nThere were also Q&A\nsessions with artists and\nvoice actors, talks about\naspects of gaming and\nanime, and an assortment\nof different activities.\nThese included, but were\nnot limited to, live band\nperformances, a big\nGeek Quiz and a cosplay\nauction (with proceeds\ngoing to Epilepsy Action)\nA lot of this might\nseem a bit daunting and\nworrying. If you decide\nto attend a convention,\nthere\u2019s honestly nothing\nto worry about it. You\ndon\u2019t have to take part\nin any of the stuff that\nhappens. Watching from\nthe sidelines (which I\nwas forced to do) can\nbe just as fun and you\u2019ll\nget an experience unlike\nany other. Rick trying\nto sell his portal gun to\nDC\u2019s Deathstroke is just\namazing to watch; it is\nliterally something you\u2019ll\nnot see anywhere else in\nyour life. And it\u2019s just one\nof the bizarrely awesome\nthings you\u2019ll get to encounter if you attend. It\u2019d\nbe worth going along with\na couple of friends so you\ndon\u2019t feel too out of place.\nThe next conventions are\nMCMC on the 25-27th\nof May and a second\nAnime and Gaming Con\non the 6-8th\nof July. And\nno, they\u2019re definitely\nnot paying me to say\nthis (although if anyone\nreading this is willing to\npay me, that\u2019d be great!)\nSaad Ahmed\nGames Editor\nGAMES\nWhy can\u2019t people in group projects be this enthusiastic? // Saad Ahmed\nSo much merch, but only so few student loans! // Saad Ahmed\n\n"

As\none of our A level texts,\nOranges provided me\nwith a first hand account\nof what it was like to\ngrow up as a lesbian girl,\nespecially within a con-servative, ultra-religious\nfamily. A bildungsroman\nof a lesbian girl involves\nself-discovery, and an\nhonest exploration of sexuality and identity. Packed\nfull of quotable lines, both\nfor their humour and\ninsight, Winterson\u2019s novel\nwas immensely enjoya-ble, and opened my eyes\nto queer narratives.\nAfewyearsafter,Icame\nacross another Winterson\nbook \u2013 Written on the\nBody, which was a loftier\nlook at lesbian love, from\na narrator that seems more\nsettled in her identity than\nin Oranges. I read it as a\nfemale narrator, but their\nsex is never specified \u2013\nmeaning that reading it as\na same-sex relationship\nsays as much about the\nreader as the author; or\nperhaps, how much the\nreader knows about the\nauthor.\nThe narrator is involved\nin a blissful relationship\nwith a married woman,\nonethatembodiespassion,\nkindness, and innocence.\nIn contrast, the heterosexual marriage is destructive\nand breaks things apart.\nUsing descriptions of\nbody parts to anatomical\ndetail, the narrator sings\nher love and desire for\nher partner, embodied in\nthe lyrical metaphors that\nworship her body in all its\nbeauty and flaws.\nCarol Ann Duffy\u2019s\npoetry celebrates\nsame-sex relationships\nin lyrical form, painting\nimages and creating\nmetaphors that turn het-erotypical romance and\nsex on its head. In her\npoem \u2018Girlfriends\u2019, the\ngraphic nature of \u2018your\nmouth to the red gold, the\npink shadows\u2019 is balanced\n\u201cThe exciting\ndiversity of\nthe human\ncommunity\nneeds to be\naccessible and\navailable\u201d\nby the gentle, feminine\ncolours, and the softness\nof \u2018shadows\u2019. Lesbian sex\nis described as delicately\nbeautiful - in the moment\nof climax she saw her\n\u2018fingers counting them-selves, dancing\u2019 in the air.\nRather than being\nfocused on lesbian rela-tionships, as the above\nare, Jackie Kay\u2019s Trumpet\nis a nuanced look at the\nambiguity of gender\ndemarcations in relation-ships, and the strength of\nlove that transcends all\nsocietal boundaries.\nThe relationship\nbetween Millie, and her\nhusband, Joss, who is a\nbiological man living as a\nwoman, has been distilled\nto the most pure form - not\none between a man and a\nwoman, nor between two\nwomen (as society tries to\npigeonhole them as), but\none between, simply, two\npeople. The book follows\nthe media\u2019s dogged\npursuit of the matter of\nJoss\u2019 \u2018real\u2019 gender, as we\nsee a family torn apart\nby attempts to label their\nrelationship. Trumpet is\nan incredible exploration\nof how inflexible, yet inherently superficial, labels\ncan be, and what it takes\nto shake them off.\nThe classic tale of\ngender fluidity has got\nto be Virginia Woolf\u2019s\nOrlando, where a young\naristocratic man changes\nhis sex halfway through\nthe book and becomes a\nwoman.\nGender fluidity and\nambiguity permeate\nevery aspect of the book,\nfrom Orlando\u2019s object\nof attraction as a man to\nher independent nature\nas a woman determined\nto publish her poetry. The\nmoment of sex change\nis described as entirely\nmundane, where simply,\n\u2018he was a woman.\u2019 And\nthen he went to have a\nbath. The unceremonial\nnature of the scene emphasises the smooth transition between the sexes,\nas if it was not a big deal\nat all. Orlando\u2019s gender\nidentity at any point in\ntime is determined by his\n\u2018performance\u2019, and is not\nan inherent fact.\nLGBT themes have\nalso flourished in fiction\ninspired by more recent\nhistory. Larry Kramer\u2019s\nThe Normal Heart is a\nplay based on his own\nstruggles to get AIDS in\nthe gay community of\n1980s New York recognised by the government,\nwhich, at the time, was\nseen as a \u2018gay disease\u2019and\nlargely ignored as people\ncontinued to die. This\nforms a significant part of\nthe solidarity of the gay\nmovement and fight for\nrecognition.\nJust slightly further\nahead in time, Tony Kushner\u2019s Angels in America\nexplores the situation of\nAIDS in New York and\nhow it impacts individual\nlives and relationships.\nDrawing parallels\nbetween the relationship\nbetween a gay couple\nand the larger trajectory\nof America\u2019s society, the\nplay explores the idea of\n\u2018movement\u2019 - society\u2019s\nrelentless march towards\nprogress, and the danger\nof stalling. \u2018The world\nonly spins forward,\u2019 says\nPrior, a gay man stricken\nwith AIDS, expressing\nhope for the future of the\ngay community - \u2018we\nwill be citizens\u2019 - as well\nas hope for the future of\nAmerica and its national\nconsciousness.\nEveryone\u2019s journey\ninto queer literature is\npersonal, and will be\nshaped by the specific\nbooks we chose to read at a\nspecific times in our lives.\nThese were the books that\ntouched me and helped to\nlift the veil of the largely\nheterotypical literature\nout there by telling the\nstories from the margins.\nThe exciting diversity of\nthe human community\nneeds to be accessible and\navailable - as a celebration\nof difference, but at the\nsame time also to combat\nbigotry and to tell others\nthat they are not alone.\nAndrew Garfield as Prior in National Theathre\u2019s 2017 production of Angles in America// Helen Maybanks\nCarol Ann Duffy\u2019s poetry turns heterotypical romance\non its head// Flickr/Lancaster Litfest\n\n"

At\nSouth Kensington, there\nwill be:\n\u2022 Several meditation sessions through\nthe week, with a session\nMonday 13:05-13:35\nfocusing on Christian tra-ditions, a session Tuesday\n12:05-12:50 focusing on\nusing mindfulness with\nmeditation and a session\nFriday 13:00-13:50\nfocusing on Buddhist\ntraditions (all meditation sessions will take\nplace in the Chaplaincy\nMulti-Faith Centre, 10\nPrince\u2019s Gardens).\n\u2022 Free massages in\nthe SAF Foyer on Tuesday\n11:00-13:30 \u2013 slots for\nthat went very quickly last\nyear so get in early!\n\u2022 Relaxation Arts\nand Crafts activities\nand smoothie making in\nMetric and Beit Quad on\nFriday from 11:30-13:00.\nCome along to have a free\nsmoothie, give mindful\ncolouring a go, and make\nyour own stress ball!\nThere will also be\nactivities on Charing\nBar on Monday 11:00-15:30 and free massages\nrunning in the Reynolds\nBar on Tuesday 14:30-17:00.\nThe highlight of the\nweek, however, will be\nthe University Mental\nHealth Day celebrations\non Thursday; from 11:00-15:30 there will be a fairground on Queen\u2019s Lawn!\nThere will be plenty of\ngames and fun to enjoy\nso take a break out of\nyour day to check out the\nactivities on offer.\nA list of all activities\nand times can be found\non the Union Website,\nso check it out if you are\nunsure what\u2019s going on.\nOther resources are also\navailable there, such as\nstress busting and revision\ntips, a weekly meal plan\ntemplate, and a list of\nresources that give help\nand advice.\nThese activities are not\nthe only thing that\u2019s happening as part of Under\nPressure! The Union Shop\nwill be selling fidget cubes\nat a reduced cost of \u00a33.95,\nwhich are a great tool\nfor anyone\u2019s pencil case\nduring exam season. Each\nface of the cube contains\na different stimulus with\na variety of textures,\nsome noisy and some\nsilent, to provide easy\nand discrete anxiety relief\nanywhere from lectures\nto public transport. Stress\nballs are designed for\npeople to release tension\nwhen stressed, however\nthis is not always how\npeople react to stress! If\nyou instead fidget when\nstressed, especially if you\nbite your nails, twist your\nhair, click pens or tap\nyour fingers on surfaces, I\nwould recommend giving\na fidget cube a go.\nOverall, this week\nis here to help every\nstudent relax and equip\nthemselves for the exam\nseason ahead, so make the\nmost of it!\nRun for a liberation\nposition!\nT\nhis year, liberation has really taken\noff as a priority for Imperial College\nUnion.Campushasseenawarenessraising events and celebrations\nincluding Black History Month, Disability\nHistory Month, Interfaith week, and the\nongoing LGBT History Month (as shown by\nthe currently-rainbow-hued Queen\u2019s Tower).\nCampaigns on everything from gender\nneutral bathrooms to divestment have been\nplastered across Felix, dominated meetings,\nand sparked conversations on what can\nbe done to improve equality and student\nwellbeing on campus. This is a fantastic first\nstep to giving liberation work on campus the\nrespect it deserves, but it cannot end here;\nthat\u2019s why we need keen students to run\nfor the Liberation and Community Officer\npositions in this year\u2019s upcoming elections.\nAll the Liberation and Community Officer\npositions have similar responsibilities:\nrepresenting their liberation group in high-level Union meetings, supporting student\ncampaigns and leading lobbying and policy\nchange within the Union and wider Imperial\ncommunity. The roles open for election are:\n\u2022 Black & Minority Ethnic Officer\n\u2022 Disabilities Officer\n\u2022 Ethics & Environment Officer\n\u2022 Gender Equality Officer\n\u2022 Interfaith Officer\n\u2022 International Officer\n\u2022 LGBT+ Officer\n\u2022 Mental Health Officer\nNominations close midnight on Sunday,\nso if you\u2019re keen to help move liberation\nwork forward nominate yourself now!\nLIBERATION\nAriana SadrHashemia\nMental Health Liberation\nOfficer\nTake your stress out with a stress ball\u2026 // Wikimedia\n\u201cUnder\nPressure\ngives you an\nopportnity\nto learn\nstrategies\nto cope with\nstress\u201d\nCross Campus, with board\ngames and arts and crafts\nrunning in the Reynolds\n\n"

The chances are\nthat photos taken by both\namateurs and professionals will stand the test of\ntime.\nOne gentleman, Joel\nSatore, has made it his\nlife\u2019s mission to photograph the approximately\n12,000 species of animals\ncurrently residing in zoos,\naquariums, and rescue\ncentres. In 2005, Joel\nstarted the \u2018Photo Ark\u2019\nin an attempt to capture\nportraits of all of these\nspecies in to raise awareness of their plight. Each\nspecies is photographed\nagainst a black or white\nbackground in order to\nensure that each portrait\nSCIENCE\nSteve Allain\nScience Writer\nL\nooking forward\nto the future of\nspecies con-servation, the\ndepressing and sobering\ntruth is that some species\nmay not be around for\nfuture generations to\nenjoy. The only evidence\nof their existence will\nbe media, and written\nreports or books documenting their ecology\nand distribution. How\nwill future generations\nknow what some of the\nmore obscure endangered species looked\nis comparable. The stark\ncontrast draws attention\nto the eyes of the subject,\ntherefore connecting the\nobserver with that particular species. As of the time\nof writing, a total of 7,521\nspecies have already been\nphotographed and become\npart of the growing Photo\nArk! Joel estimates that it\nwill take him an additional 15 years to finish photographing the remaining\n~4,500 species.\nJoel\u2019s goal is simple- to\ntry and show the world\nof biodiversity in a new\nlight, and attempt to get\neveryone to care about\nthe species currently\nfacing extinction, whilst\nthere is still time to act.\nThis project has recently\njoined in a partnership\nwith National Geographic in order to help raise\nawareness and funds to\naid Joel\u2019s mission. The\nfortunes of some species\nsince the start of the\nproject have changed for\nthe worse. One of these\nis a species of frog which\nbecame extinct in September 2016, when the\nlast known individual of\nthe Rabb\u2019s fringed-limbed\ntree frog, nicknamed\n\u2018Toughie,\u2019 passed away.\nThe species suffered\nheavy declines in Panama\ndue to disease; the last\nknown individuals were\ntaken into captivity to establish a captive breeding\nprogram.\nUnfortunately, this\nfailed with the last\nfemale dying in 2009,\nmeaning the species was\nfunctionally extinct until\nToughie\u2019s death. Hopefully the other species on\nthe Photo Ark will gain\nthe awareness, funding\nand the protection they\nneed in order to recover\nand remain in the wild\nfor future generations to\nenjoy.\nHow brain chemicals make you crave alcohol\nConnect with conservation \u2013 photographing\nextinction\nSCIENCE\nSarah Wong\nScience Writer\nA\nfter a demanding week at\nuniversity, it is\nfinally Friday\nand your friends have\nsuggested to go for drinks\nlater that evening. \u2018Ok\u2026\njust one drink\u2019, you\nreplied, but several hours\nlater you are smashed,\nand walking in a straight\nline is practically impos-sible! It is apparent that a\nhangover is coming your\nway, and you think to\nyourself \u2013 why did I not\nstop after the first drink?\nAlthough it is funny to\nwatch your drunk friend\nhitting on a statue (trust\nme it is hilarious) alcoholism is not a laughing\nmatter. It gravely impacts\non the lives of many indi-viduals, and alcohol-re-lated diseases put a heavy\nburden on our healthcare\nsystem and the economy.\nHence, it is important to\nunderstand the disease in\norder to develop better\ntreatments for alcohol\ndependence.\nA new therapeutic\ntarget was investigated by\na research group led by\nHu Cheng, a senior scientist in the Department\nof Psychological and\nBrain Sciences in Indiana,\nUSA. They showed that\na chemical in the brain\nformally known as a neu-rotransmitter, mediates\ncued alcohol cravings.\nAlcohol cravings, like\nhunger, can be triggered\nby smell, sound, and\nvisual cues \u2013 for example\npictures of alcohol. In\nour daily lives, we come\nacross this on the high\nstreet without even realising it, such as when\nbakeries entice customers\nwith their distinct aromas!\nMore often than not we\nend up strolling in, which\nis due to our brains associating these cues with\nrewards. This is attributed\nto a specific neurotransmitter called glutamate,\nwhich is a key regulator in\nthe reward pathways.\nIn our brains, levels\nof neurotransmitters are\nmaintained with a fine\nbalance. A tip of this\ndelicate equilibrium is\nassociated with diseases\nsuch as depression and\nParkinson\u2019s disease.\nSince the anterior cingu-late cortex (ACC), along\nwith glutamate are both\ninvolved in the brain\u2019s\nreward network, unsur-prisingly, a change in the\nlevel of the neurotransmitter has been linked to\nalcohol addiction.\nPreviously, it has\nbeen reported that ACC\nactivity is related to other\nforms of addiction such as\nnicotine and illicit drugs;\nhowever, the underlying\nneurotransmitter changes\nrelated to alcohol craving\nwas unknown.\nFor this reason, the\nresearch group studied\nand compared brain scans\nof different groups using\nimaging technology such\nas magnetic resonance\nspectroscopy, with a focus\non the level of glutamate\nin alcohol-dependent\npatients versus a control\ngroup. The research group\ndemonstrated the area\ninvolved in glutamate\nsignalling overlaps with\nthe brain regions that\nresponds to alcohol-relat-ed cues, thus implicating\nthe role of ACC and\nglutamate in mediating\naddiction.\nFurthermore, when the\nalcohol-dependent group\nwere shown pictures\nof alcohol, glutamate\nconcentration in the ACC\nsignificantly dropped. In\nthe control group with no\nalcohol dependence little\nor no change was seen in\ntheir glutamate level. This\nresult nicely demonstrates\nthe important role of\nglutamate in cue-induced\nrelapse in humans, thus\nnew therapeutics may\nnow seek to target glutamate levels to manage\naddictions!\nThough the study population size is quite small\nwith only 17 patients\nstudied, one cannot just\nyet reduce alcoholism to\na problem to be treated by\npills. Nonetheless, it is a\ngreat step towards understanding the biological\ncausation of addiction.\nMoreover, we can start\nhelping those in need as\nwell as breaking down\nthe social stigma against\nthose who are physically\ndependent on alcohol.\nNot the tree frog that went extinct\u2026 // Wikimedia\nShots, shots, shots // Wikimedia\n\n"

It\u2019s the same reason the left\nand the right exist in real-world politics.\nCOMMENT\nAlan Perfect\nComment Editor\nE\nvery time student\nelections come\nback to Imperial,\nI always remember the sheer confusion of\nmy old flatmate when deciding whom to vote for:\n\u201cBack home in Italy, there\nis always a left-wing and\na right-wing candidate in\nstudent politics. Choosing\nwho to vote for was much\neasier there\u201d.\nI won\u2019t get into what\nthis says about Italians\nin general, but I do\nacknowledge it\u2019s an interesting approach to student\npolitics. The \u201cpressure\u201d of\nproperly reading all the\nmanifestos and the guilt of\nvoting for whoever looks\nfriendlier in the photo is\ntaken away. It\u2019s just so\neasy. But that\u2019s not what\nhappens in the UK. Here\nwe vote on manifestos.\nAt first sight, pure\nmanifestos just seem like\nthe right approach: you\nread what each candidate\nproposes and decide\nrationally, depending on\nthe issues you care about,\nwithout any ideological\nprejudice blurring your\nmind from choosing the\nright one. It just seems\nlike the thing you should\ndo.\nIf you let your curious\nmind to think this through\nfurther, though, you start\nto wonder whether this\napproach would work\nin real life politics. It\u2019s\na claim many centrist\nparties like to make:\n\u201cvote policies, don\u2019t vote\nideology. Read manifestos\nand vote for the proposals\nyou care about. Politics\nisn\u2019t football, so stop\ncheering for your party\nlike it\u2019s your team, and put\nsome effort into voting\nwith your head. Controversies are just tools the\nleft and right use to stir\nthings up\u201d. Centrist parties\nlove to promote this kind\nof thinking. They adore\ncoming out as the purely\nenlightened sensible\noption. Emmanuel\nMacron claimed several\ntimes he was neither left\nnor right. Similarly Albert\nRivera, leader of Spain\u2019s\ncentrist party, has claimed\nthe same thing during\ncampaigns.\nKeep digging further\ninto this way of voting,\nhowever, and you\u2019ll\neventually find it\u2019s just\nnonsense. At least in the\nlong run. And there\u2019s a\nsimple, nearly mathematical reason why. Candidates can copy policies. If\na policy is uncontroversial\nand its goodness is universally accepted, every\ncandidate will put it in\ntheir manifesto. And why\nwouldn\u2019t they? It\u2019s for the\ngreater good!\nSo how are candidates\nsupposed to differ, if, in\nthe long run, all universally good policies are\nadopted by all of them?\nThey differ in how they\napproach controversial\npolicies. Be it deciding\nbetween public cuts and\npublic spending, military\nintervention in the\nMiddle East, immigration\npolicies \u2013 it is the answer\nto controversial questions\nthat really defines a\ncandidate. At least the\nserious candidates in real\nworld politics. This is, in\nfact, the only reason the\nconcept of left and right\nwing politics exist, and\nwhy it will always exist. It\nmakes the whole process\nof sorting out controversial positions easier. What\nbaffles me, then, about\nevery student election here\nat Imperial, is that some\ncandidates often differ\nbecause they propose\ndifferent uncontroversial\nproposals, which just\nshows a massive amount\nof sheer incompetence.\nHow difficult is it to copy\nthe proposal? How out\nof the loop are you as a\ncandidate, that others are\nproposing easy, uncontroversial policies and\nyou haven\u2019t even heard\nof them? Just do your\nresearch, please. I implore\nyou.\nOk, we\u2019ve established\nthat you need the concepts\nof left and right to have a\nserious candidate, so now\nour own beliefs come to\nplay in the vote. We often\ncomplain that students\nat Imperial are very\napolitical. While some\nof it might come from\nprivilege \u2013 you don\u2019t need\nto take a strong stance on\nissues if the system grants\nyou everything you need\u2013\nsome of it might come\nfrom the intrinsic nature\nof the Imperial student.\nScientists and engineers\nvalue taking rational decisions based on facts, and\nThey do look friendly, to be honest // Imperial College Union\n\u201cWe know\nthat you need\nthe concepts\nof left and\nright to have\na serious\ncandidate\u201d\nthey are used to solving\nproblems where there is\na factually right solution\nbacked by evidence.\nBacking a certain candidate or ideology certainly\nfeels like it\u2019s against\nevidence and reason,\nbecause ideology, in the\nend, is just an assortment\nof collective myths and\nbeliefs.\nLet\u2019s define a spectrum\nso you, as a reader, can\nhave a bit of an interactive experience placing\nyourself at some point in\nbetween two extremes.\n\u201cYou need\nto actually\nbelieve in\nsomething\nin order to\nchange the\nworld\u201d\nStaff strikes and workers rights \u2013 how can we\nbring true equality?\nThis week, with all the strikes going on, Grumpy Bastard looks at why they are happening at\nall. And they have a solution to stop this happening again.\nT\nhis week,\nImperial has\nbeen shoved\nrudely into the\nmodern age by encountering workers\u2019 rights,\nan issue that has plagued\nemployers since the Black\nDeath wiped out the majority of the peasants. The\nimmediate consequence\nof this was that the nobles\nand landlords had to lighten up on the oppression\nbecause there weren\u2019t\nenough serfs to slave in\nthe fields. Over time, the\ncause of workers rights\nhas been advanced by the\nthreat of violence by revolution or revolt as well\nas the establishment of\nunions. Union has almost\nbecome a dirty word since\ntheir defeat by the Iron\nLady in the 1980s, but\nthey probably have had\na net beneficial effect for\nthose of us unfortunate\nenough to have to work\nfor a living.\nApparently, the issue\nthat has brought the meek\nand mild lecturers onto\nthe streets is that Imperial\nis now changing its\npension system. Beyond\nthat, I, like most of my\nfellow students, have no\nidea what is going on. I\ntried reading the handout\nthat one of the union representatives was aggressively forcing on those of\nus innocently wandering\nthrough Sherfield, but I\nnearly fell asleep halfway\nthrough the words\n\u201cindividual investment\nscheme.\u201d I have decided,\nlike the rest of the world,\nthat facts are boring and\nI can rely on the more\ncompelling and probably\naccurate assertion that the\ncollege is evil for attempting to take the pensions\naway and I should stand\nwith the workers; or at\nleast not resent them too\nmuch for robbing me of\nmy education.\nThe alternative narra-tive, the one that is completely devoid of empathy\nand therefore will appeal\nto physicists, is that, as I\nown the lecturers because\nof the substantial tuition\nfees I pay, they are putting\nme at a considerable\ndisadvantage for daring\nto voice these socialist\ndemands. Some have\neven argued for a refund\nof fees for the lectures\nand tutorials missed as\nthe workers of Imperial\nCollege crusade for fair\ntreatment, but I\u2019m unsure\nif they want compensation\nfrom the College or the\nlecturers themselves. This\nis of course a ridiculous\nstance to take, as the\nCollege would sooner part\nwith a good third of their\nresearch staff before refunding students. Heaven\nforbid that the President\nshould take a pay cut.\nThis of course follows\nthe general trend of a\nreduction in standards\nof pensions worldwide.\nCarillion, the construction\nfirm, went bust following a gaping hole in its\npensions scheme, and\nBHS employees suffered\nfrom a colossal hole in\ntheir pension scheme after\nPhilip Green had stripped\nthe company of all its\nvalue and used the wealth\nto build a fleet of yachts\nand become the king of\nthe sea. I for one welcome\nthis lack of foresight and\npreparation for old age\nwhich will allow further\nconcentration of wealth\nin the hands of those that\nare already incredibly\nwealthy. I mean, being\na peasant in pre-plague\nEurope really wasn\u2019t that\nbad if you\u2019re a big fan\nof mud, beatings and no\nhuman rights. We just\nhave to hold out for the\nnext round of antibiotic\nresistant bacteria for\nsociety to become equal\nonce more.\nOn one extreme there\u2019s\nthe sceptical, doubting,\nopen-minded person.\nSomeone who\u2019s not completely sure who to vote\nfor in the next election.\nThis type of person is\na shape-shifter; an ever\nchanging, hard-to-pin\ndown voter. On the other\nside of the spectrum\nthere\u2019s the believer by\nwill. The true believer\nthinks that her ideas are\nbetter for the world. Much\nmore close-minded and\nhard to convince, she\nknows exactly who she\u2019s\nvoting for and why.\nEach side has its pecu-liarities. The ones on the\nsceptic side tend to love\nhaving arguments, and are\nparticularly strong against\nany ad-hominem attacks\nbecause it\u2019s so hard to pin\nthem down. But it\u2019s hard\nfor anything of value to\ncome out if your ideas are\nnot grounded at all and\nlack the necessary depth.\nBeing on the other\nside is different. When\nyou\u2019re so convinced of\nyour ideas, because you\nare much harder to sway\nto the other side, you\ncan potentially end up\nbecoming a Nazi without\nnoticing it. And this is a\nbig dilemma, because you\ncan only truly change the\nworld if you really believe\nin what you are doing.\nBe it an entrepreneur,\na social activist or an\nartist, it\u2019s hard to imagine\nthem having any positive\nimpact on the world\nwithout firmly believing\nthey can do it without any\nfactual evidence. And this\nis the big problem. You\ncan\u2019t change the world\nthrough politics by being\na shape-shifting, ideolog-ically-empty centrist who\njust focusses on hard facts.\nYou have to take a side\nand affirm your beliefs in\na well-grounded ideology.\nBut it\u2019s hard. If you\u2019re\non the sceptic side of the\nspectrum, you know how\nhard it is. Some people are\nso firm in their beliefs it\u2019s\nclose to admirable. Some\nlefties are born lefties;\nsome religious people are\nborn religious (by born I\nof course mean nurtured\nby their families).

At the\ntop, the wind was so strong\nthat we could lean our\nwhole body weight into it\nwithout falling over! We\nkept our sheltered break\nshort, before starting the\nlong but gentle descent\nto the end of stage five,\narriving just after midday.\nIt was far easier underfoot than in the previous\nstages, but even so it was\n15km, and by the end of\nthe stage we were split as\nto whether we should do\na double stage to get back\non schedule and escape\nthe 80 Belgian paratroopers that were hiking the\nsame trail and crowding\nthe pristine wilderness.\nConcluding that it was\nmore important to finish\ntrekking for the day than\nout-hike the paratroopers,\nCarla and Diane stayed\nwith the boys and enjoyed\na relaxing afternoon of\nwine, beer, and tuna pasta\nwith our hiking friends\nAlexandra and Mandus.\nMeanwhile, Max pressed\non to the next stage alone,\nescaping the testosterone\nof 80 commandos, who\nwere singing their intimidating chants \u201cSEX,\nDRUGS, GUNS, AND\nDANGER \u2013 THAT\u2019S\nTHE LIFE OF THE\nAIRBORNE RANGE\u201d\nduring the night, only to\nhear us reply with our\nRSM ones: \u201cWE ARE\nMINERS!\u201d\nDay Seven: Stage Six\nWithout our leader to\nguide us, we opted for a\nmore laid back 9am start\nfor stage six, knowing\nit was one of the easier\nstages. After a late night\nin the hotel bar saying\ngoodbye to Victor and Lila\n(some hiking friends who\nwere ending their GR20\nexperience), we were glad\nfor a lie-in that morning\n\u2013 especially Harry who\nmay have had one too\nmany beers! One benefit\nof the army men taking\nover the camp was the\nboxes of free ration pack\nsnacks they left behind\nfor anyone to help them-selves. We got a bit carried\naway with the concept of\nfree food (the refuge food\nwas very expensive \u2013 I\u2019m\ntalking \u20ac6 for four slices\nof ham expensive!) and\nwe started the day with\npacks multiple kilograms\nheavier!\nThe gentle climb and\ndescent to Lac Du Ninu\npresented no problems.\nWe had a paddle in a painfully cold lake and many\nbreaks throughout the\nday, thoroughly enjoying\nthe Corsican landscape\ninstead of having to glue\nour eyes to the tricky\nterrain at our feet.

After two hours\nof relentless scrambling,\nwe reached the summit\nat 6am while it was\nstill dark, and a dim red\nglow was visible on the\nhorizon. Also, joining us\non our twilight climb was\na dog that guided us all\nthe way up \u2013 whenever\nwe got lost, we could see\nhis eyes glowing red and\nwe knew where the right\nway was! We called him\nMax to complete the team\nonce again. As the sun\nbegan to rise, we wriggled\nback into the comfort and\nwarmth of our sleeping\nbags and enjoyed the\nlandscape before us,\nrelishing the fact that\nthe hard work was over\nand everyone back at the\nrefuge would have only\njust begun to stir. It was\none of the best moments\nof our GR20 expedition.\nWe spent an hour taking\nphotos and listening to\nHans Zimmer\u2019s Inception\nin our sleeping bags\nbefore emerging back into\nthe chilly morning air to\nbegin traversing along the\narete.\nThere were some\nawkward slabs, boulders,\ngullies, and short\nscrambles to negotiate,\nincluding a very steeply\ninclined slab with chains\nunderneath a boulder\nthat practically required\nsliding down on our bums.\nAt this point, Harry sped\nahead down to the refuge\nbecause he was desperate for a poo, and upon\narrival was disappointed\nthat the toilets were holes\nin the ground to squat\nover. Meanwhile, Diane,\nGeorgios, and Carla took\nadvantage of the head\nstart on the other hikers\nBreath-taking views in Corsica // Georgios Chatzitheoklitos\n\u201cWe had a\npaddle in\na painfully\ncold lake, and\nmany breaks\nthroughout\nthe day,\nthoroughly\nenjoying\nthe Corsican\nlandscape\u201d\nThesunwasstillblazing\nin the sky upon our arrival\nto Refuge Manganu so\nwe went for a swim in\nthe river and sunbathed\non the granite rocks.

Upon\narrival, we found Max\n(the person as well as the\ndog!), and Diane thoroughly spoilt the dog with\nleft-overs from her dinner.\nIn fact, she became way\ntoo attached to the dog,\nand Carla was surprised to\nfind her bed occupied by\nhim when she came back\nfrom dinner in the refuge!\nHe was swiftly kicked\nout and spent the night\nsleeping in the tent outer\ninstead.\nDay Nine: Stage\nNine-A\nHaving started at 4am\nthe day before, we relaxed\nthe start time by five hours\nand set off at 9am. Since\nMax didn\u2019t have such a\nlong day previously, he\nwas off before we woke\nup, negotiating stage\nnine \u2013 the last stage of the\nnorthern part of the GR20.\nMuch to our dismay, the\ndog was also nowhere\nto be seen, despite us\ntreating him so well the\nnight before! We had a\nfew hours of steep ascent\nfollowed by a long but\nmainly gradual descent.\nGetting up to the peak\nwas tricky and involved\nsome scrambling. Even in\nplaces that didn\u2019t require\nscrambling, we found\nthe steep incline very\ntiring after the previous\ndouble-stage. On the\nway down, we found a\nwaterfall with a deep pool\nunderneath so we took\noff our boots and took\nthe plunge \u2013 many times\nin Carla\u2019s case. We then\nproceeded to sunbathe for\nan hour or so, and when\nHarry eventually suggested moving on, Georgios\nand Diane responded\nrather unenthusiastically\nas they lay back down to\nsunbathe! We also came\nacross a British couple\njust before we left, and\nHarry tried to lecture\nthem about the Geology\nof Corsica \u2013 I don\u2019t think\nthey were quite as enthusiastic as him!\nThe last part of the\nday was nearly luxury\nfor the GR20 \u2013 an almost\npaved path leading down\nto Vizzavona where the\nguidebook had promised\nus a pizzeria. There was\nindeed a pizzeria but,\nmuch to our horror, we\nwere told their pizza oven\nhad broken! Nevertheless,\nwe treated ourselves to a\nmeal in the restaurant with\nAlex, Mandus, and Max.\nDay Ten: Stage Ten\nWe were planning to\nleave at 9am that morning\nbut it was 9:30am by\nthe time Georgios and\nHarry had finally put\ntheir tent down. It didn\u2019t\nmatter though because\nthe day\u2019s route was easy,\nand we covered ground\nvery quickly. We could\nalready see the difference\nbetween the terrain in the\nsouth compared to the\nnorth. From one of the\nhighest points reached\nthat day, the Aiguilles de\nBavella were visible in the\ndistance \u2013 pointy peaks of\nthe penultimate day on\nthe trail and a reminder\nthat we were closing in\non Conca. Most of the\nday consisted of walking\nthrough a forest, with\nmuch shallower inclines\nthan we were used to. In\nfact, the terrain was so\nmuch flatter than on the\nprevious days that we\npassed the time by singing\nmusicals, ABBA, Queen,\nand Eminem. There was\na particularly good spot\non a rock overlooking a\nforested hilly landscape,\nwhere we took a break\nand Harry sang \u2018The Hills\nare Alive\u2019.

But\nperhaps their new album,\nLittle Dark Age, is proof\nthat abstract expressionist Barnett Newmann\u2019s\nview - that the encounter\nbetween art and audience\ncan be considered as a\nmeeting between two sentient beings, where either\none can be changed by\nthe experience - can hold\ntrue for music as well.\nTransposing this notion\nonto MGMT\u2019s discogra-phy, the trajectory of their\ncreative process and content of their output begins\nto make far greater sense.\nThis exploration seems\nfitting for a band that has\nhad such a turbulent relationship with its listeners.\nBeginning their careers\nas budding musicians\nat Wesleyan University,\nNew Yorkers Andrew\nVanWyngarden and Ben\nGoldwasser, known\ntogether as MGMT,\nstarted making music as\na side project in college.\nTheir first few songs, originally released on the EP\nTime to Pretend (though\nsome would find their\nway onto debut album\nOracular Spectacular)\nwere originally meant to\nbe a sardonic exercise in\ntrying to make the most\ncommercially-sounding\nmusic possible. The only\nproblem was, against all\ntheir expectations, the\npublic loved it. Maybe too\nmuch for the pair\u2019s liking.\nA record deal with\nColumbia followed, but\nthe public adulation and\ncountless commercial\ndeals were more disheartening than encouraging,\nfor people were taking\ntheir jokes seriously; the\nsongs that were supposed\nto be subverting the status\nquo of popular music,\nor at least showing its\nproblems, were actually\nthe break had been good\nfor them. The gigs were\nexciting, the tide was\nbeginning to turn, people\nwere warming to their\nnew and exciting sound.\nOver the course of\ntheir previous albums,\nthe mood deteriorated as\nquickly as the quality of\ntheir sound, resulting in\njolly tunes such as \u2018I love\nyou too, death\u2019 and \u2018Your\nlife is a lie\u2019. But now, their\nart seems to have finally\nbenefited from the increasingly negative public\npush back. They acknowledged their dwindling lis-tenership and decided to\nno longer take themselves\nso seriously. They enlisted\nthe help of Ariel Pink and\nConan Moccasin (the\nman who Mac Demarco\nconsiders the best guitar\nplayer he knows) for their\nnew record, whose sound\nis a welcome 180 degree\nturn from previous efforts.\nKicking off the album\nis the absurd \u2018She Works\nOut Too Much\u2019, a track\nwith enough groove and\nreverb to be at home in\nan 80s aerobics video\n\u2013 spandex and all. But\ndespite its goofy lyrics\nand double-entendres\n(working out as a partner\njuxtaposed with physically working out), the\nmessage is pertinent to\nsociety. It tells the story\nof a technological generation that has become\ntoo fickle and superficial,\nbut it doesn\u2019t do it in a\nheadache-inducing way\n(anyone rememberArcade\nfire\u2019s \u201cLove is hard / Sex\nis easy\u201d line? Yeah, me\nneither), nicely setting the\ntone for the album. The\nentire thing excellently\ntoes the line between the\nabsurd and meaningful,\nand by the end, the\ncommon thread throughout the album is one that\nMGMT themselves have\nadmitted to having lost\nfor a while after their\ndebut; they completely\nforgot that making music,\nlike life, was also about\nhaving fun. And so the\nlyrics from \u2018When you\ndie\u2019: \u201cAnd words won\u2019t\ndo anything / It\u2019s permanently night / And I won\u2019t\nfeel anything / We\u2019ll all be\nlaughing with you when\nyou die\u201d ring especially\ntrue when considering\ntheir creative journey. It\nis simultaneously creepy,\nfunny and moving.\n\u2018Me and Michael\u2019,\na great song as well as\nthe centre of hilarious\nand unexpected colab\nwith Filipino band True\nfaith (just check out the\nmusic video), is another\nhighlight of the album.\nIt\u2019s about friendship and\nsticking together in the\nface of adversity. Sadly,\nthe two songs that follow\nare potentially the weakest\non the record. \u2018TSLAMP\u2019\n(Time Spent Looking At\nMy Phone), is another\ncritique of the tech addiction facing modern\nsociety, but besides one\ngreat lyric (\u201cFind me\nwhen the lights go down\n/ Signing in, signing out /\nGods descend to take me\nhome / Find me staring at\nmy phone\u201d), it is slightly\ndull, repetitive, lacking in\nany hooks and generally\nslows down the album.\n\u2018James\u2019 is another stray\nbullet, sounding like\nregurgitated Ariel Pink\n\u2013 except far worse. After\nthese, the vibe picks up\nagain, with instrumental\n\u2018Days that got away\u2019\nacting as a poignant segue\ninto the final three songs,\nwhich are capped off with\nthe delicious, Tame Impala-esque \u2018Hand It Over\u2019.\nThe best song on\nthe album, though, is\nthe second title track.\nIt features a handful of\npowerful lines; a wavy,\ngothic, synth backdrop; a\ndrum that packs a punch;\nand vocal effects which\nonly serve to enhance the\nfeeling of dread conjured\nby the lyrics. The song,\njust like the album as a\nwhole, shows that MGMT\nhave learned much from\ntheir sabbatical, and the\nrapidly sold-out London\nshow tells us that listeners\ntook notice.\nMGMT stands for\u2018My Gaudy M\u00fcnch Take\u2019 // Columbia\nMUSIC\nMartin Flerin\nMusic Writer\nArtist: MGMT. Label:\nColumbia. Top Tracks:\nHand It Over; Little Dark\nAge; Me And Michael. For\nFans Of: Metronomy; Ariel\nPink; Unknown Mortal\nOrchestra. 44 minutes\nLITTLE DARK AGE\n\u201cThey\nacknowledged\ntheir\ndwindling\nlistenership\nand decided to\nno longer take\nthemselves so\nseriously\u201d\nblending into it. So they\nturned on their own sound.\nIn fact, they decided that\nthey would take a detour\noff the highway to pop\nstardom with their next\nLP, 2010\u2019s Congratulations. And, well, if that\nwas a detour, 2013\u2019s\nself-titled album drove the\nbus off a cliff.\nAnd off the face of the\nearth they disappeared...\nA five-year gap in albums\nand a two-and-a-half-year\ngig hiatus might have\nbegun to look terminal,\nbut midway through\n2017 they started teasing\nmaterial for a new album,\nand it became evident that\n\u201cThe entire\nthing\nexcellently\ntoes the line\nbetween the\nabsurd and\nmeaningful\u201d\nRoxy Music\u2019s For Your Pleasure\nI\nn a time when Elton\nJohn dominated\nradio play and sales,\ncrowds flocked\nto catch a glimpse of\nDavid Bowie\u2019s on-stage\ntheatrics, and the bulk of\nunderground intelligentsia\nattributed artistic merit to\nPink Floyd, it was pretty\nhard to break into the\nBritish music scene. No\nsurprise then, that Roxy\nMusic are often overlooked when ruminating\non the golden era of glam.\nFormed in 1970, these\nart college kids were\nalways a bit different. Not\ncontent to deliver the big\nrock riffs of Led Zeppelin\nand Queen, they strove\nto establish a new sound,\nand a fresh approach to\nmaking music. Frontman\nand founder Bryan\nFerry was an old-school\ncrooner: a silver-tongued,\ntuxedo adorning Prince\nCharming with an eye\nfor all things avant-garde.\nJoined by a gaggle of\nimpeccable, yet somehow\nunlikely, musicians, their\nline-up was beyond solid.\nSetting them apart,\nhowever, was none other\nthan the man with the\nMidas Touch, one Brian\nEno, making his first steps\nin the world of music.\nOften seen sporting heavy\neye makeup, long hair\nand a collection of feather\nboas, Eno could play no\ninstruments. He\u2019d had\nno formal training and\nno songwriting experi-ence. What he did have,\nhowever, was a brilliant\nmind. A mind that saw the\nworld through a kaleidoscopic lens, distorting all\nthat was surely known and\nfinding clarity in chaos,\nsomething that has paid\nThough creative\ndifferences with Ferry\nwould eventually lead to\nEno\u2019s departure, leaving\ncan be found shimmering over their first two\nalbums, 1972\u2019s Roxy\nMusic and 1973\u2019s For\nYour Pleasure. The latter\nis generally considered\nto be their magnum opus,\nand features some of their\nmost daring and memorable compositions.\nFrenetically swerving\nbetween high-octane\nstompers (\u2018Do The\nStrand\u2019, \u2018Editions Of\nYou\u2019, \u2018Grey Lagoons\u2019),\nsmooth groovers (\u2018Beauty\nQueen\u2019, \u2018Bogus Man\u2019),\nand chilling soundscapes\n(\u2018Strictly Confidential\u2019,\n\u2018For Your Pleasure\u2019),\nRoxy display the full\narsenal of their auditory\nassault. The pivotal track\nis \u2018In Every Dream Home\nA Heartache\u2019. Backed\nwith a sinister rock organ\nand very little else, Ferry\u2019s\nfragile monologue gradually unveils a disturbed\nman, deeply apathetic\ntowards modern society\u2019s\nmaterialistic obsessions.\nOpulent but empty, only\none object evades his\ndisdain: an inflatable doll,\nbought mail order. Upon\nthe uttering of \u201cInflatable\ndoll / Lover ungrateful / I\nblew up your body / But\nyou blew my mind\u201d, Phil\nManzanera\u2019s muscular\nguitar kicks in with a\nspiralling solo, backed\nwith a thunderstorm of\ndrums and Eno\u2019s signature phase-shifting tape\neffects.\nAs the eerie reverberations of the album\u2019s\nprogressive closer fade\nout and the heavy clouds\nbegin to wither, it\u2019s clear\nthat this is an extraordinary album by a band\nway ahead of their time.\nAmid the frequent pace\nchanges and ominous un-dercurrents, it\u2019s far from\nan easy listen, though one\nthat inspired a host of mu-sicians. Inexplicable and\nat times impenetrable, the\nalbum ends with a fitting\nvocal contribution from\nJudi Dench: \u201cYou don\u2019t\nask / You don\u2019t ask why\u201d\nDAMN. Kung Fu Kenny!\nI\nfeel like I\u2019ve spent\nthe last five months\nas Felix Music Editor\nalmost exclusively\nwriting about Kendrick\nLamar. Nonetheless,\nplease indulge me one\nmore time\u2026 I\u2019ll try to\nkeep it brief. Kendrick\nLamar completed the\nUK leg of his DAMN.\nworld tour last week,\nperforming six nights and\nshutting down arenas in\nBirmingham, Manchester,\nGlasgow, and London.\nThe show played out\nlike a kung fu film, with a\nrecurring theme of martial\narts running throughout\nand the concert beginning\nwith a short film depicting\n\u201cthe damn legend of Kung\nFu Kenny\u201d. The night got\noff to a frantic start as\nKendrick kicked off his\nset with a literal BANG\nbefore launching into\nthe explosive \u2018DNA.\u2019,\ncomplete with a ninja\nsharing the stage with\nhim. This breathless\nstart to the show set the\npace for the rest of the\nevening as Kendrick\nproceeded to perform\na medley of up-tempo\nfan favourites, including\n\u2018ELEMENT.\u2019 and \u2018King\nKunta\u2019. It wasn\u2019t until\nafter performing his\nfeature verse on ScHoolboy Q\u2019s \u2018Collard Greens\u2019\nthat Kendrick gave the\ncrowd a moment to catch\nits breath, before taking\nus back with \u2018Swimming\nPools (Drank)\u2019 and\n\u2018Backseat Freestyle\u2019\nfrom 2012\u2019s good kid,\nm.A.A.d city. The intro to\n\u2018FEEL.\u2019 played out whilst\nan accompanying dance\nperformance took place\non stage as King Kendrick\nmade his way to perform\n\u2018LUST.\u2019 and \u2018Money\nTrees\u2019 in an elevated cage\nin the centre of the regular\nstanding section, amongst\nhis adoring subjects.\nKendrick standing within\nspitting distance of me\nwas arguably the highlight\nof my evening and that\nmoment was only matched\nby the a cappella rendition\nof \u2018HUMBLE.\u2019 as the\nconcert drew to a close.\nThere was something\nmagical about hearing the\n20,000-strong crowd echo\nback every line from the\ntrack and even Kendrick\nseemed touched, pausing\nto witness the extent\nto which his music has\nimpacted the culture\nand pervaded the mass\nconsciousness of our\ngeneration.\nThis was quite simply\nthe best concert I\u2019ve\nattended, worth every\npenny of the \u00a380 ticket\nprice. If his masterstroke\nin executive producing\nthe Black Panther album\nweren\u2019t enough proof that\nKendrick is an artist at the\npeak of his powers, seeing\nhim perform live proves\nhis artistry seemingly\nknows no bounds. Not\nto sound clich\u00e9, but only\none word can describe the\nextravaganza Kendrick\nput on for us: DAMN.\nMUSIC\nAdrian LaMoury\nMusic Editor\nToo many joy-rides in Daddy\u2019s Jaguar // Island\nThere are tragically few art-rock bands with a dedicated oboist.\ndividends throughout his\nlong and illustrious career.\nThat and a Revox reel-to-reel tape machine.\nthe band to veer towards\na more straightforward\nsoft-rock sound, his\nexperimentalist glaze\nFans were treated to a musical and visual masterpiece as Kendrick brought the DAMN. experience to London.\nMUSIC\nAndrew Djaba\nMusic Editor\nDAMN.

Yet this\ncouldn\u2019t be further from\nthe truth. Some of the\nmost memorable moments in Olympic history\nhave been steeped in pol-itics: from Jesse Owens\u2019\ndefying Adolf Hitler\u2019s\nAryan supremacy right\nunder his nose to the black\npower salute challenging\nracial bigotry in the 1968\nSummer Olympics. Thus,\nwhen the South Korean\ngovernment invited their\nbitter rivals from the north\nto compete alongside\nthem in the current Winter\nOlympics, it was well\nwithin this long tradition\nof sports and politics\nbeing intertwined. Yet the\nquestion that remains is\nwhether this remarkable\nact of reconciliation by\nthe south will have any\npositive effect or not. This\nis not the first time the\nNorth and the South have\nmarched together in an international sporting event:\nthey did so most recently\nin the 2014 Asian Games.\nYet each time, such gestures by the South have\nbeen met by nuclear tests\nand other UN violations.\nInstead, could this\ngesture bring further legitimacy to the Kim-Jong\nUn regime? The Kim\nfamily has dilapidated the\nvitality of the innocent\npeople of North Korea by\ntransforming the entire\ncountry into a concentration camp. They have\nwaged a war of constant\nfear on their neighbours\nby routinely threatening\nthem with nuclear anni-hilation, accompanied\nby sporadic kidnappings\nand assassinations. It\nis difficult to argue to\nSouth Koreans, who live\nunder the constant spectre\nof nuclear mushroom\nclouds, that this tyranny\ncould be rewarded by the\nhonour and pageantry of\nthe Olympic Games.\nIt should be remembered that this decision\nby the South Korean\ngovernment has not\nbeen very popular with\nits people. It was hard\nearned tax dollars from\nthe South Korean citizens\nthat financed the hosting\nof this event. Yet in events\nlike ice hockey where both\nnations are competing as\none unit, South Korean\nathletes who have trained\nfor years to compete and\nrepresent their country in\nfront of their home crowd\nare having to sacrifice\ntheir well-earned places\nto make way for their\nill-trained North Korean\ncounter parts. As a result,\none the key tenants of the\nOlympics, meritocracy,\nis being abandoned for a\ngimmick that is unlikely\nto yield any meaningful\nresults.\nThe citizens of South\nKorea have provided\nlarge quantities of financial aid and food relief\nto the North. Yet their\ngestures of good will have\nbeen reciprocated with\nhateful propaganda by the\nregime to their isolated\npeople. Therefore, a time\nmay come in the future\nwhen South Koreans say\nenough is enough. Let us\nhope that this unnecessary\ngesture does not result\nin greater resentment by\nSouth Koreans which\nwould hinder future peace\nefforts.\nparallel. The last time\nSouth Korea hosted the\nOlympics (the Summer\nevent in 1988) the North\nKoreans shot down a\nSouth Korean passenger\nairliner, killing over one\nhundred people.\nHowever, by yielding\nto intimidation, the South\nKoreans have unilaterally\ndeclared that blackmail\nworks. At the heart of\nthe Olympic spirit is\nfollowing the rule book.\nHas the threat of terrorism been incorporated\ninto the Olympic charter\nsomehow?\nThe Olympic spirit,\nsince ancient Greece, has\nsymbolised the hope for\nworld peace, yet in reality\nsuch events cannot be\nallowed to be hosted in\npolitical silos. We must\nnot be lulled into a false\nkumbaya moment. The\nNorth Koreans will not\nenter the negotiating\ntable to surrender their\nnuclear arsenal and\nabandon their hostile and\naggressive posture by\nsimply allowing them to\ncompete in the Olympics\nalongside their South\nKorean brethren. North\nKorea is a pariah, and so\nneeds to be isolated and\nnot given further gestures\nof goodwill. South Africa\nwas boycotted for over a\ngeneration from sporting\nevents due to apartheid.\nSurely the vast crimes\nof North Korea warrant\na similar, if not greater,\nglobal isolation.\nThe pathway to hell\nis often paved by good\nintentions. The unification\nof the Korean peninsula\nthrough peaceful and\ndiplomatic means is a\nnoble idea. It is important,\nhowever, to remember\nthat the vast majority of\nSouth Koreans were born\nafter the Korean War in the\n1950s \u2013 with no memory\nof a unified Korea. Yet\nwhy should young South\nKoreans have to see\ntheir sporting heroes cast\naside for political stunts\nthat have little prospects\nof advancing the peace\nprocess? South Korea\nand the rest of the world\nshouldn\u2019t abandon the\npeople imprisoned within\nthat slave state. And to\ntheir immense credit, the\nfamily of nations led by\nSouth Korea have led the\nhumanitarian aid effort\nfor decades that has\nprevented mass genocide\ndue to starvation. But\nwelcoming the North\nKorean regime to parade\nthemselves under the\nOlympic banner as if there\nis no real crisis at hand,\nwill do a disservice to the\nseriousness required.\nNorth Korean & Sotuh Korean Flags side by side // Pixabay\n\u201cSouth Korea\nhas provided\naid to the\nNorth, but\nthis has been\nreciprocated\nwith hate\u201d\nThe decision by the\nSouth Korean government\nis not without any merits.\nThey have been placed in\nbetween a proverbial rock\nand hard place. By including the North Koreans,\nthe South Koreans have\nendeavoured to avoid any\nincident in the demilita-rised zone along the 35th\n\n"

It is on this\nroof that they\u2019ve found\nthemselves cornered by\nthe police. It\u2019s not all bad\nthough: their robbery has\nbeen somewhat successful\n\u2013 they\u2019ve managed to grab\na bag of cocaine and a\nbottle of whiskey to share\nbetween them. This is the\nsetting of John Donovan\u2019s\ndebut play \u2013 two young\nmen stranded on a roof in\nEnnis, a small, rural Irish\ntown.\nDespite the deceptively\nsimple premise, If we got\nsome more cocaine\u2026 is\nfar from straightforward \u2013\nthrough its two characters\nit comes to explore themes\nof identity and sexuality,\nfamily, poverty, small-town mentality, and much\nmore. Yet, somehow, it\nnever feels contrived.\nMikey and Casey are\nhigh on adrenaline and,\nsoon, on coke; trying to\nfind a way out of the situation they\u2019re in. Mikey\nis eager to escape from\nthe rooftop to get to the\nparty they\u2019re supposed to\nbe going to \u2013 he wants to\n\u2018show off\u2019 Casey to his\nfriends. Casey, however,\nis reluctant, almost\ncontent to stay where they\nare for just a little while\nlonger.\nTheir respective attitudes to their sexualities\nis one of the main themes\nof the play. Mikey is\nout and proud and has\nbeen defending his sexuality through fist fights\nfor years now. Casey,\nhowever, is still in the\ncloset, afraid of his violent\nand homophobic stepdad,\nwho punches him for little\nreason, and is likely to\nbe even more angry if he\nfinds out Casey is gay. It\u2019s\nmore complicated though:\ndespite Mikey\u2019s apparent\npride in who he is, he\ncan\u2019t come to terms with\nchanging attitudes \u2013 his\nex is getting married to\nanother man, and he can\u2019t\nunderstand their desire\nto publicise their rela-tionship, stuck in a world\nwhere he feels he needs to\nconstantly defend his sex-uality. Casey is a similar\ncontradiction: he is afraid\nto be out, but, at the same\ntime yearns for Mikey to\nsay he loves him.\nAlan Mahon and Josh\nWilliams are fantastic as\nMikey and Casey respec-tively. Mahon is part of the\noriginal cast, having performed in the play since\nits debut in 2016, whereas\nWilliams has joined the\nteam for the play\u2019s run\nat Vault Festival. Their\ndiffering experience with\nthe roles really doesn\u2019t\nshow though because they\nhave a truly great chemistry and feed off each\nother naturally. There\u2019s\nan awkwardness to their\nrelationship that perfectly\ncaptures the confusion\nof the characters who are\nstruggling to accept who\nthey are to each other.\nWilliams\u2019 Casey wears\nhis vulnerability on his\nsleeve \u2013 he is so clearly\nyoung and afraid that you\ncan\u2019t help but feel for him.\nMahon, though, takes this\nperformance to another\nlevel entirely. On the\nsurface, Mikey is aggressive and violent, easily\npicking fights; however,\nas the play progresses,\nMahon peels back the\nlayers of violence to\nreveal the tender and\nafraid young man hiding\nbeneath.\nThe vulnerability\nof both young men is\nperfectly captured in a\nmoment where Mikey\nasks Casey what he sees\nin him. Casey struggles\nto convey his feelings,\nsimply stating that what\nhe likes is \u201cjust\u2026you\u201d\n. When questioned by\nMikey, who in turn can\u2019t\nbring himself to accept\nthis unconditional affec-tion, is convinced it must\nbe his looks, or what he\ncan do for Casey.\nGeorgia de Grey\u2019s\nrooftop set is simple, but\neffective. Its role here is\nto allow the actors to own\nthe stage. The intimate\nsetting of The Vaults is\nperfect for this production\nand it really benefits\nfrom the proximity to\nthe audience. Director\nThomas Martin clearly\nJohn Donovan\u2019s debut play about identity is a triumph.\nAlan Mahon and Josh Williams are brilliant as the gay couple Mikey and Casey // Keith Dixon\nARTS\nVaishnavi Gnanananthan\nArts Writer\nWhere? Vault Festival\nWhen? Until 25 Feb\nHow Much? \u00a314.50\nIF I WE GOT SOME MORE\nCOCAINE I COULD SHOW\nYOU HOW I LOVE YOU\n\u201cWithin\nthe space\nof a single\nconversation,\nDonovan\nmanages to\ncapture the\ncomplexity of\nentire lives\u201d\nhas a great understanding\nof Donovan\u2019s work and\nbeautifully captures the\nintensity of the relationship between the two men.\nDespite the play being\na single scene for one\nhour, it never feels tired\nor boring. The real star\nof the show, however, is\nundoubtedly playwright\nJohn Donovan. It\u2019s hard\nto believe this play is\nhis debut work and it\u2019s\nbeyond clear that his\nIARA award for best new\nplaywright was clearly\ndeserved. Somehow,\nwithin the space of an hour\nand a single conversation,\nhe manages to capture the\ncomplexity of entire lives.\nIf we got some more\ncocaine I could show\nyou how I love you is\nindependent theatre at its\nbest. The Vault Festival is\nthe perfect place for this\nplay and it is more than at\nhome in a programme full\nof stellar productions and\ninnovative storytelling.\nIt\u2019s a pity that its run at\nVault is so short because\nthis play is one that really\ndeserves to be seen.\n\n"

Having the strongest 2nd team, and\nthe 1st team winning the cup.\nL\nast weekend saw\nImperial Squash\nreturn victorious from the\nRoehampton University\nCup. This highly prestigious tournament, held at\nthe classy Roehampton\nClub, is a highlight of\nthe squash calendar, and\nfeatured teams from 16\nuniversities.\nOn Saturday morning\nwe arrived fresh and\nraring to go. Imperial\nhad entered both their 1st\nand 2nd\nteams. The 1st\nteam, made up of Puven\nSubramaniam, James\nMcCouat, Patrick Brandl,\nPamela Hathway, and\nDave Newman stormed\nthrough their group, prevailing 5-0 over Bristol\n2s, Southampton 2s, and\nLeicester 2s. The 2nd\nteam, comprising of Tom\nReadshaw, Sam Horne,\nAndre Bharath, David\nAnderle, and Francesca\nLim lost to Durham, but\na convincing win against\nthe Kings 2s saw them\nprogress, along with the\n1st team, to the quarter-fi-nals \u2013 the only university\n2nd\nteam to do so.\nLater that day there\nwas an exhibition match\nbetween Daryl Selby\n(former world no. 9) and\nRobbie Temple, famous\nfor his two-handed\nambidextrous style- he\nactually swaps his racket\nhand during rallies. Our\nvery own Patrick Brandl\n\u201cFrom 2-10\nImperial claw\ntheir way back\nto a 15-14 win,\nwinning the\ncup\u201d\nappeared to concede his\nown pick-up and after\nnot hearing a call from\nthe referee, changed his\nmind) and awarded the\npoint to the other player.\nThe players were both\nconfused and somewhat\nreluctantly appreciative\nof this unorthodox but\nentertaining refereeing\nstyle. The match proved\nto be a hit with the players\nand the crowd. It was a\nfantastically entertaining\nway to mark the half way\npoint of the tournament.\nThere was a formal dinner\nprovided after the match\nand Daryl thanked Patrick\nin his after dinner speech,\nadmitting he \u201cvery much\nenjoyed his suspicious refereeing\u201d , but not without\nmentioning that he \u201cgot\nthe ball in question\u201d.\nAfter indulging in a few\ngroup photos with Daryl,\nand once Pamela Hathway\nhad finished catching up\nwith her former colleague\non the PSA world tour, the\nImperial teams retreated\nfor the night to rest up for\nthe following day\u2019s big\nmatches.\nThe first fixture on\nSunday was an intriguing\none: an all Imperial affair\nin the quarter-final. The\n1s progressed through to\nthe semi-finals, but not\nwithout the 2s putting up\na tough fight, providing\nthe sternest test so far of\nthe 1st team\u2019s fitness and\ntechnique. Imperial 2s\nthen faced the play-offs\nfor places 5-8. They\npushed LSE and King\u2019s\n1s right to the wire and\nfinished the tournament\ncomfortably the highest\nplaced 2nd team in the\ncompetition \u2013 a superb\nachievement.\nIn the semi-final, the\nImperial 1s team faced\ndefending champions\nLeicester, who had\nbrought the same winning\nteam as last year. Imperial\nhad lost to them at the\nsemi-final stage in the\n2017 edition of the tour-nament, but this time they\nstormed to a convincing\n4-1 win. Everyone played\nout of their skin, especially our number 1, Puven\nSubramaniam, who beat\nthe Leicester number\n1 (a PSA world ranked\nplayer), in a match many\nsaid was more exciting\nthan the exhibition match\nthe previous evening.\nRevenge tasted almost\nas good as the club sandwiches on offer in the\nmembers\u2019 bar.\nIn the final, Imperial\nwould come up against\na Surrey team brimming\nwith confidence after\ncruising through the\nrounds on their side of\nthe draw. Surrey\u2019s team\nwere extremely tough\ncompetition and despite\nexceptionally brave\nperformances at 2nd and\n4th\nstring, Imperial found\nthemselves 2-0 down and\nstrings, Patrick Brandl\nand Dave Newman, took\nto the court, each knowing\nnothing short of a win\nwould suffice. It was a\ntense affair: after drawing\nlevel in his match, Dave\nfound himself 2-10 down\nin the final game. What\nfollowed was a truly\nnail-biting comeback that\nsaw him win on a tense\nsudden death point with\n15-14 \u2013 nothing short of\na miracle. That\u2019s why\nwe call him the iceman.\nSpurred on by the cheers\nfrom the crowd, now\nflocking to see the conclusion of his title deciding\nencounter, Patrick found\nsome exceptional form in\nthe final game to win in\nstyle against a very solid\nopponent. Against all the\nodds, it meant victory for\nImperial!\nAs a prize for winning\nthe tournament, Imperial\nreceived a large glass\ntrophy, VIP tickets to the\nCanary Wharf Squash\nClassic, and a year\u2019s\nsquash membership to\nRoehampton Club.

Unfortunately, after falling asleep\non the bus, he found\nhimself coming all the\nway back to the hotel and\nmet by the second wave of\nfencers. Our men\u2019s foilists\nwere also looking pretty\nrough however that didn\u2019t\nstop Imperial having a\ncompletely unexpected\nbut incredibly successful\nday. Filip, Ailsa, Ben and\nSherry each teamed up\nwith fencers from other\nuniversities, whilst we\nhad an all-Imperial men\u2019s\nfoil and men\u2019s sabre team.\nFilip, Ailsa and Sherry\u2019s\nteams all breezed into\nthe finals, finishing 2nd\nin\nmen\u2019s epee, 2nd\n(losing\n43-45!) in women\u2019s foil,\nand Sherry added a team\ngold to her medal collec-tion!\nBen\u2019s team and our\nmen\u2019s sabreurs were\nknocked out in the middle\nstages of their events,\nwhilst our men\u2019s foilists\nwere had won their\neasier matches and were\nsomewhat waking up.\nThey continued winning\nand made it through both\ntough quarter and semi-fi-nals!

Naturally, as\nUnit 58 is essentially just\na booth, there is not much\nto remark about the actual\nvenue, but the menu board\nabove the counter did\nimpress me with its range\nof flavours (for both the\nwaffle and ice cream) and\nexciting toppings.\nThe Food\nAfter spending a good\nfew minutes debating\nwhich flavours and\ntoppings to pick, I decided\nto stick with a relatively\nsimple combination:\noriginal bubble waffle,\nmatcha ice cream, blue-berries, and Nutella.\nAs the waffle is made\non order it was really interesting to see the batter\nbeing poured into the\nround cells on the special\nfrying pan. My bubble\nwaffle was assembled\ncarefully, with blueberries being delicately\narranged and Nutella\nartistically drizzled. It\ncertainly looked appetis-ing! However, in reality\nthe dessert itself is not\nparticularly practical, and\nI began to worry how I\nwas actually going to eat\nit. Thankfully a spoon\nwas provided to attack the\nrather oversized dessert,\nand I eagerly dipped into\nthe ice cream and its\ntoppings.\nand took a rather awkward\nbite of the bubble waffle.\nThe outside of the waffle\nhad a crunchy sweetness\nwhile the inside was light\nand fluffy, but disappointingly the waffle did not\nhave that much flavour\noverall. When I finally\nmanaged to combine the\nwaffle with the ice cream\nit was rather pleasant and\nrefreshing as it was not\ntoo sweet. Nevertheless,\nit definitely looked better\nthan it tasted.\nFood writer Bl\u00e1ith\u00edn Dockery heads to Nosteagia in Shoreditch to see whether bubble waffles are an upgraded\nversion of ice cream or just a pointless online-fad.\nNosteagia offer bubble waffles in Shoreditch // Nosteagia\n\u201cPlenty of\nphotogenic\ndelicious\ntoppings\u201d\n\u201cI braced\nmyself and\ntook a rather\nawkward bite\u201d\nAlthough traditionally\neatenplain,bubblewaffles\nhave been inspired by the\nThe matcha ice cream\nhad a nice soft subtle\nflavour which was complemented by the sharp\njuicy blueberries and the\nrich chocolately Nutella.\nBut really the ice cream\nwas not what I had come\nfor, so I braced myself\nWorth the hype?\nNo. Bubble waffles are an online sensation\ndue to their photogenic arrangements and endless\ntopping combinations. However, in reality it is a\nrather awkward dessert with nothing particularly\nspecial (at least flavour-wise) about it.\nPrice\nBubble waffle, ice cream, 2 toppings: \u00a35.50\nBest part\nHow pretty it looked\nWorst part\nAwkwardly trying to eat it\n\n"

Our\nthirteen-strong team of\nelite athletes jetted off\nto the Northern lands of\nSheffield for a full weekend of cheering, racing,\nand, of course, dancing\nthe night away. Held at the\nEnglish Institute of Sport,\nthe championships offers\na chance for university\nathletes from across the\ncountry to kick-start their\nseason and get a sense of\nwhere they\u2019re at before\nthe year ahead.\nAfter a harrowing train\njourney full of cancelled\nreservations and rammed\ncorridors, we eventually\nreached our destination,\nwith some members of\nthe club already on the\ntrack and competing less\nthan an hour after arrival\n(#hardcore). Given that\nI had no events on the\nFriday, I just made for a\nglorified cheer-squad, so\nspent my day cheering on\nMarta in the 60m hurdles,\nKate and Sarah in the\nwomen\u2019s 800m and James\nand Jonathan in the men\u2019s\n800m. The first day of\nthe competition primarily\nconsisted of heats, where\nathletes competed to\n\u201cA special\nshout out to\nSarah Johnson\nfor making the\n3000m final\nand Sarah\nAbrams who\nmade the long\njump final\u201d\n\u201cWatching the\nother athletes\nleaping\ngracefully\nover ridiculous\nheights with\nease was\npretty damn\ninspirational\u201d\nqualify for the semi-finals\nor final of their event.\nTo finish the day, we\nset off to check into what\nturned out to be a top-qual-ity hostel (thankfully athletics\u2019 captain Max Thorp\nhas good taste) and for an\nevening cooking together\nas a team. Led ably by\nHyde Park Relays organiser Kate Olding, we went\non to produce a military\namount of amazing carbonara (and it was proper\ncarbonara too). With\nmuch of the team competing the following day,\nwe then turned in early to\nget ready for the big day\nahead.\nOn to Saturday we went\n\u2013 the busiest day of the\ncompetition, with many of\nour members competing\n(myself included). On the\nway to the stadium, I discovered all of the events\nwould be filmed and\nstreamed online, which\npersonally I found hilarious given what a beginner\nto the sport I am. As long\nas none of my family\ncould find the stream, I\nwas safe. Men\u2019s Captain\nLewis Jackson turned out\nan excellent performance\nin the men\u2019s 1500m,\nas did Kate Olding and\nSarah Grover, who had\nboth progressed to the\nsemi-finals of the 800m.\nA special mention too for\nWomen\u2019s Captain Anna\nLawson who delivered a\nPB in the 1500m, as well\nas Stephanie Hewitt and\nOliver Newton for their\nperformances in their\n3000m heats. Last, but not\nleast, we had ex-Athletics\u2019\nCaptain Raul Rinken\nthrowing strong in the\nshot-put. It would be\nfair to say I hardly set the\nworld on fire in the high\njump, but the chance to\nexperience competition\nat such a level and watch\nthe other athletes leaping\ngracefully over ridiculous\nheights with ease was\npretty damn inspirational\n(I\u2019m talking over 2 metres\nhere\u2026).\nAfter cheering on the\nrest of the team until the\nlate afternoon, the day\ndrew to a close. Having\ndecided we had all earned\nit, we set off in matching\nICXCAC tie-dye t-shirts\nfor the finest Chinese all-you-can-eat that Sheffield\nhad to offer. Following\non from this, the half of\nthe team that had finished\ncompeting went off\ninto the night to sample\nthe renowned Sheffield\nnightlife. They were not\ndisappointed, if their\nappearance the following\nmorning was anything to\ngo by.\nAnd then it was\nSunday: finals day. Or in\nmy case, the start of the\n200m heats. No one could\nmanage to explain to me\nwhy the entirety of the\n200m competition was\nbeing run all in one day,\nfinal and Sarah Abrams\nwho made the long jump\nfinal! They did not dis-appoint. One of the best\nthings about going to this\nevent was that not only\ndid you get the chance\nto compete, but you got\nto sit and watch some of\nthe best athletes in the\ncountry battling it out in\nreal time (for free!). Much\ndrama followed, from\nshock disqualifications, to\nlast minute dives over the\nline to take the gold. What\nmore could you ask for?\nAll in all, an amazing\nevent to take part in! If\nyou\u2019ve not worked it out\nyet, I\u2019m completely new\nto athletics, but I can\nhonestly say getting out\nof your comfort zone and\ngiving it a go is not something you\u2019ll regret.

Much to the\ndelight of some players,\na livestream on social\nmedia offered the opportunity to witness the\nearly matches without\ndisruption to their sacred\nmorning routines. Starting\noff in group stages, the\npairs showcased not only\ntheir technique but also\ntheir ability to adapt to the\ntraditional English ruling\n(11 points, best of three),\nwhich caused for some\nconfusion about who had\nto serve. The first day of\nthe tournament ended with\ncurly fries in the union,\nevoking happy memories\nof years gone by for the\nnumerous alumni attending the tournament.\nThe Mixed Final kicked\nthings off on Sunday with\nthe pair Victoria Leow/\nAlex Li (LSE) seeing off\nIC\u2019s former men\u2019s No1 Ian\nJubb playing together with\nCarrie Elliott (women\u2019s\n2nd team captain) in two\nclear games. The women\u2019s\nfinal went the full distance\nand LSE\u2019s pair Clara Ng /\nAlexa Tzarnas (LSE) triumphed over Melissa Lee\n(LSE)/Pamela Hathway\n(IC). Germany\u2019s former\nnational player stayed on\ncourt for another final,\nwhen she was joined by\nPatrick Brandl (IC men\u2019s\n1st\nteam) to compete in the\nGrade A final. Hathway/\n\u201cDoubles\ncan be a lot\nmore fun than\nsingles and is,\narguably, more\nmultifaceted\u201d\nBrandl proved that not\nonly can a mixed team\nplay in Grade A, but they\ncan even make quite an\nimpression \u2013 they hadn\u2019t\ndropped a single game\non their journey to the\nfinal. They faced the\ntournament favourites,\nMarco Alves / Puvendren\nSubramaniam (IC men\u2019s\n1st\nteam) who were also\nyet to drop a game.\nMuch to the delight\nof the spectators and\nonline-viewers, the match\nturned out to be a close\none, with both pairs being\ntested by long rallies (we\neven saw the odd dive to\nretrieve some balls). Unsurprisingly in a doubles\nmatch on a singles court,\nthe referee got involved,\nand the players welcomed\nthe opportunity for a\nfriendly debate with\nhim. Hathway/Brandl\nadapted their strategy to\nthe shot-making of Subramaniam and the clean\nhitting of Alves, which\nforced lengthy and deep\nexchanges on the hot and\nhumid courts at Ethos.\nIn the end, Alves/ Subramaniam were able to\nexert their authority, and\nHathway/Brandl had to\nsettle for the consolation\nprize of being the only\npairing to claim a game\noff them all tournament.\nWe wanted the tournament to provide a\ncompetitive inter-univer-sity doubles competition,\notherwise lacking in the\nBUCS setup, but also\nto serve as a means for\nplayers from different\nuniversities and different\nand Badminton, where\ndoubles is an integral part\nofBUCSmatches,doubles\nsquash is not played as\npart of the league, or as a\nstandalone event. Singles\nsquash seems to overshadow its high paced\nand ultra-tactical doubles\ncousin. There is also the\ncommon misconception\nthat it is not possible to\nplay doubles on a regular\nsingles court. There are\nindeed specialised, wider\ncourts, but these are few\nand far between in the\nUK, and you are unlikely\nto find one down at your\nlocal club. But it most\ncertainly is possible to\nplay doubles on a singles\ncourt \u2013 in fact, it makes\nit all the more tactical as\nyou try to outmanoeuvre\nyour opponent and find\nspace where there is not\nmuch to be found.\nDoubles can be a lot\nmore fun than singles\nand is, arguably, more\nmultifaceted. The game\nis much less about heavy\nhitting and fast running,\nand more akin to a chess\nbattle with your opponent,\nthinking several moves\nahead about how you\nare going to move them\naround the court, as well\nas how you are going to\nuse your partner for that\nkiller blow to win a rally.\nWhereas singles is mostly\nwon on fitness and power,\ndoubles is won with the\nmind.

Completely unprepared for such a\nsimple but unbelievable performance by Carey\nMulligan. Rather than\noverwhelming complex-ity, it is the simplicity of\nthis beautiful show that\nleaves one overwhelmed,\nemphasised by the cosy\natmosphere of the Royal\nCourt Theatre.\nWith a small stage, no\nprops, and a simple set,\nCarey Mulligan takes us\non a personal journey, told\nby a friend. Perhaps recognising how biased her\nopinion is, she provides\ndetails - memories that\nmattered to her and made\nher story unique. How\nlost she was in those early\nyears of adulthood, how\nSouthampton showed up\non/in her way and how\nshe told destiny to fuck off\nand went to Paris. Often,\nher easy speech brings out\nlaughter in the audience.\nHer story glides along,\nuntil she introduces us\nto her husband - the way\nthey met, the way she had\na complete disgust for\nthe man. The simple and\nfunny way of life of that\nman and how easily she,\nbit by bit, makes us fall in\nlove with him too. How\ncould we not? - that is the\nquestion.\nThe attraction of a\nnormal and predictable\nway life shines over this\ncouple as well: kids,\na house, jobs. At the\nbeginning, this ideal life\nstory seems to represent\nsomething for us, just\nlike it had for her - but\nas she goes on, we are\ncompelled to wish it does\nnot anymore.\nbring her life to where she\nis now.\nIn an impressively\nemotional performance,\nCarey Mulligan turns\nsomething that might\nhave been a feel-good\nshow into a much more\ninsightful play about the\nmost important aspects\nthat rule our lives. Sometimes, there are things we\ncannot control, things that\ndo not go to plan, life is a\nmess, it hurts, but we can\nmake it work. Situations\nwill leave us baffled, torn\napart, but people are brave\nand bravery can be seen in\nthe simplest acts of someone\u2019s life.\nGirls and Boys is\na simple show full of\nintention behind every\nsentence. Carey Mulligan\nbegins with an ordinary\nstory, where we find\nourselves laughing at the\nmost quotidian situations.\nHowever, she unexpect-FlamencoabsentinthisFlamencoFestivalshow\nI\nlike flamenco dance\nand music, and was\nthus particularly\nexcited about this\nshow; however, perhaps\nbecause I chose the wrong\nshow out of the various\nnights on offer, or because\nthe festival\u2019s theme was\nnot as I had anticipated -Isabel Bay\u00f3n and Israel\nGalv\u00e1n\u2019s show, Dju-Dju\nwas spectacularly bad - so\nbad, in fact, that I noticed\nseveral audience members\nleaving halfway through\nthe show.\nFor something billed\nas part of the Flamenco\nFestival, one would\nexpect some, well,\nflamenco dancing.\nInstead, the audience were\ntreated to a Jesus lookalike walking around the\naudience hugging random\npeople, a keyboardist\nwearing, of all things,\na dressing gown, and a\nwhite Christmas tree on\nremote-controlled wheels.\nIsabel Bay\u00f3n, who is a\nclassical flamenco dancer,\nhardly danced - there were\nonly two scenes where\nshe danced an appreciable\namount of flamenco. Even\nthen, these dances were\nonly teasing - just as we\nthought we would finally\nget a decent amount of\ndancing, she stops - no\ndance lasted more than\nthree minutes long.\nWhen she did dance,\nBay\u00f3n was great - I caught\nsnippets of the grandeur,\nenergy and spontaneity\nof the flamenco art form\nthat originated from the\nfolk dancing of Southern\nSpain. There were\nelements of the dextrous\nfootwork and fluid hand\nmovements that make\nflamenco so well-loved.\nGranted, the theme\nof this particular show\nwas black magic and\nvoodoo - practices that\nare entrenched in Gypsy\nculture, and thus, expressible in the flamenco\ndance form. However, I\nwas expecting classical\nflamenco dancing inspired\nby motifs of black magic,\nbut what we got was a\nbizarre narrative with\nflashing lights, stomping,\nlots of walking around,\nand only a light sprinkling\nof actual dancing. Perhaps\nI should have known\nbetter - the choreographer,\nIsrael Galv\u00e1n, is known\nfor his avant-garde twist\non flamenco performanc-es.\nIn this case, the\n\u2018avant-garde\u2019 flavour was\nexcessive, so excessive\nthat it was simply bizarre,\nand almost disrespectful.\nThe comic elements, such\nas Jesus controlling the\nChristmas tree or Bay\u00f3n\nriding her broomstick,\nquickly got tired and took\non a crass flavour. I was\nalmost angry watching it,\nangry at its debasement\nof the flamenco art form,\nand the joke on us that we\nwere watching this thing\non stage. At one point,\nthe show was cut by a\nridiculous video projected\nonto the stage, of some\nindistinct blurry footage\nthat served no purpose\nwhatsoever. In another\ninstance, Bay\u00f3n\u2019s fellow\ndancers danced around\nwhile gliding around in\na chair - what value that\nwould add, I have no clue.\nFortunately, this show\nis only on one night of the\nfestival, and it is over. I\nam sure the other nights\nof the Flamenco Festival\nwill be better, or at least I\nhope so. If you decide to\nattend, I wish you a more\nenjoyable experience.\nCarey Mulligan dazzles in Girls & Boys// Marc Brenner\nIolanthe: an odd choice for the current climate\nB\naffling, bright,\nand bonkers\nwould be an\naccurate way\nto sum up the English\nNational Opera\u2019s take\non Iolanthe. Having\noriginally been performed\nback in 1882, the satirical\ncomedy about the House\nof Lords versus a band of\nfairies has been somewhat\nrejuvenated, including a\nBoris Johnson look-a-like\nriding along on a bicycle.\nTo an opera-novice\nsuch as myself, the phrase\n\u2018Gilbert and Sullivan\u2019 had\npreviously meant very\nlittle. Now I know that\nGilbert and Sullivan were\nco-creators of a range of\ncomic operas back in the\n19th century, including\nIolanthe, a baffling tale\nof Iolanthe the fairy,\nwho was banished from\nFairyland for marrying a\nmortal man. Fast-forward\ntwenty-five years and\nIolanthe\u2019s son, Strephon,\nis in love with a shepherd-ess, but unable to marry\nher as her guardian and\nhis fellow politicians are\nall in love with her too.\nWhat may sound like a\nsweet story of fighting\nfor true love is actually\na lot creepier than it first\nseems.\nIt seemed odd that in\n2018, when awareness\nof sexual harassment is\nrising, an opera in which a\nscene with twenty old men\narguing over a nineteen-year-old woman would be\nallowed to go ahead and\neven be seen as comical.\nIt was an uncomfortable\nscene made more bizarre\nby the shepherdess\u2019 actual\nguardian (and therefore father-like figure)\nallowing it to happen and\nparticipating in it himself.\nIn defence of the show,\nit was written at a time\nwhen societal rules were\ndrastically different to\nour own, and, for the\ntime, perhaps the show\nwas somewhat successful\nin displaying societies\nwith both women and\nmen in leadership roles.\nDesigned as a comical\nsatire, it is evident that the\nelderly politicians aren\u2019t\nexactly model designs for\nauthority figures, and the\nlives of both fairies and\nmortal men are indeed\nimproved by the presence\nof the other. Or, at least,\neveryone seemed happier.\nBeyond the obvious\nplot flaws and peculiarities (the fairies feeling\ngiddy over their nephew is\nnearly as disturbing as the\npoliticians fighting for the\nshepherdess), the show\nhas its positive moments.\nThe opening of the show\nwas a purely instrumental\nnumber, with Timothy\nHenty doing a grand job\nof conducting a team\nof talented musicians.\nTheir work was the most\nimpressive aspect of the\nnight, especially when\nHenty politely laughed\nalong with a joke about\nhis bald spot, delivered\nby a gently fireman-esque\ncharacter.\nThe fireman, acting as\nthe emcee for the night,\nintroduced each act with a\nrepertoire of mildly funny\njokes and even some\nimpressively self-aware\njokes about how middle\nclass the audience was.\nIt was evident that the\nhumour he was attempting at wasn\u2019t designed\nfor a twenty-something\nyear old student, but\neven I would admit his\nextinguishing of the fire\neffects during the show\nwas genuinely amusing.\nSpeaking of humour,\nmost of the jokes throughout the production passed\nstraight over my head.\nA prime example being\nthe odd farmyard animal\n\u2013 including a unicorn -randomly appearing on\nstage. What seemed to me\nas a misaimed pantomime\ngag clearly worked as\nlaughter erupted around\nme, but by the fourth\nsheep I had still not caught\nup with the herd.\nCal McCrystal, a\ndirector and actor known\nfor his comic consultancy\nwork on films such as\nPaddington and The\nWorld\u2019s End, has recently\nturned to opera as a new\nadventure. The director,\nopenly acknowledging the\nsatiricalnatureofIolanthe,\ndecided to go ahead with\nthe political jokes despite\nthe current situation of\nBritish politics. Despite\nhis supposed expertise,\nhowever, the few jokes\nthat succeeded were\nrepeated over and over\nuntil the audience was left\nwith an uneasy feeling of\na sitcom audience following a sign saying \u2018laugh\u2019.\nA prime example would\nbe the use of stage hands\ndressed in black morph\nsuits blindly searching\naround the stage for the\nprops they were putting\nout. What was at first\ngiggle-worthy grew into\na sigh by the end of the\nsong.\nLogistically, the production was an overall\nsuccess. The stage was\ncolourfully decorated,\nan impressive large\ntrain bursting through\na background garnered\nthe awe it deserved, and\nthe costumes were aptly\ncolourful and fairy-like.\nThe only two factors that\nwould have benefited\nfrom alterations would\nhave been the volume\nand subtitles. At times,\nthe cast were on the quiet\nside, which was irritating\nduring speech, but would\nhave been fine during\nthe songs as the songs\nwere subtitled, had the\nsubtitles always been on\nview. Repeated lines were\nsometimes only shown\nthe first time of hearing.\nIf you missed the line that\ncrucial first time, tough\nluck.\nOverall, Iolanthe had\na community-hall feel\nabout it, but the singers,\ndespite whatever creepy\nlyrics they were singing,\nperformed very well.\nThough, if you find\nyourself desiring an\nexploration of opera, it\u2019s\nprobably best to start with\nanother one.\nENO\u2019s restaging of the 19th century comic opera fails to amuse.\nBaffling, bright, and bonkers indeed // Clive Barda\nARTS\nJo\u00e3o Baptista\nArts Writer\nWhere?

Your silence will\nnot protect you. But for\nevery real word spoken,\nfor every attempt I had\never made to speak those\ntruths for which I am\nstill seeking, I had made\ncontact with other women\nwhile we examined the\nwords to fit a world in\nwhich we all believed,\nbridging our differences.\nAnd it was the concern\nand caring of all those\nwomen which gave me\nstrength and enabled me\nto scrutinize the essentials\nof my living.\u201d\nThis confessional call-to-arms - at once bold\nand vulnerable - was the\nreiteration of a lifetime\u2019s\nphilosophy for Lorde,\nwhose essays and poetry\nhad established her as a\nvital and necessary voice\nat the forefront of the\nintersectional feminist\nmovement.\nThrillingly, Lorde\u2019s\nwriting demands nothing\nless than utter revolution:\ncritiquing not only the\npatriarchal, heteronorma-tive society that oppresses\nwomen, but also examining what she regarded\nto be the false principles\nwithin feminism. Rather\nthan rejecting the terms\nand philosophies that are\noften weaponized against\nwomen, she reclaims\nthem.\nIn her essay Uses of\n\u201cThrillingly,\nLorde\u2019s writing\ndemands\nnothing less\nthan utter\nrevolution\u201d\n\u201cLorde\u2019s\npoetry is angry\nyet what draws\nthe reader\nback is an\nundercurrent\nof hope\u201d\nthe Erotic, Lorde untangles eroticism from\npornography, which\n\u201cemphasises sensation\nwithout feeling\u201d, and\nelevates it to the spiritual.\n\u201cRecognising the power\nof the erotic...can give\nus the energy to pursue\ngenuine change\u201d writes\nLorde, concluding that\nsuch a thing would never\nbe possible \u201cwithin the\ncontext of male models of\npower\u201d.\nHer 1979 essay The\nMaster\u2019s Tools Will Never\nDismantle the Master\u2019s\nHouse is a further exploration of the idea that a\ncomplete overhaul is nec-essary. Written to express\nher disappointment at the\nlack of inclusion of black\nand lesbian women in\nfeminist conferences, in\nthe essay she forcefully\ndecries white feminism\n- accusing it of being too\nacademic, too wilfully\nignorant of poor women,\nof women of colour and\ntheir issues, too reliant on\nthe power structures of the\npatriarchy to defend their\nexclusions.\nShe returns to the issue\nin Age, Race, Class and\nSex - \u201cby and large within\nthe women\u2019s movement\nthere is a pretense to a\nhomogeneity of experience covered by the word\n\u2018sisterhood\u2019 that does not\nin fact exist\u201d. Throughout\nher work, Lorde calls\non the reader to reject a\nsystem that disregards\ndivergent experiences,\nreject \u201ccosmetic changes\u201d\nand build one that celebrates differences: \u201cin\nour world\u201d she implores,\n\u201cdivide and conquer\nmust become define and\nempower\u201d.\nThe immediacy of\nLorde\u2019s call for greater\ninclusion must in part\narise from her own life:\nfor her, the political was\nintensely personal. As a\n\u201cblack lesbian feminist\nsocialist mother of two,\nincluding one boy, and a\nmember of an interracial\ncouple\u201d Lorde cannot\nhelp but be inclusive, it\nkeeps her \u201chonest\u201d - the\ncomplexities of which\nshe brilliantly describes\nin an essay exploring the\nchallenges of raising a\nboy as a lesbian mother in\nMan Child.\nIn The Silence Will\nNot Protect You, Silver\nPress\u2019 new edition of\nLorde\u2019s work, her essays\nare brought together\nwith some her poems.\nSomewhere in the\nmiddle of the slim pink\npaperback is a transcript\nof a conversation with\nthe poet Adrienne Rich.\nThis sweeping interview,\nrich with detail, we learn\nthat prose never came\nnaturally to Lorde, who\nexpressed herself from an\nearly age through poetry.\nIndeed her poems, packed\nwith punchy imagery\nare a potent distillation\n- reducing down pages\nof prose into a short few\nlines.\nGood Mirrors Are\nNot Cheap rehashes The\nMaster\u2019s Tools: \u201cIt is a\nwaste of time hating a\nmirror/or its reflection/\ninstead of stopping the\nhand that makes glass\nwith distortions\u201d.\nSometimes filled with\nbrutal imagery, Lorde\u2019s\npoetry is unflinchingly\nangry and fearless: she is\nnot one to sugarcoat or\nmince words, yet what\ndraws the reader back\nis the undercurrent of\nbelief in a better future,\na skein of light that is\nalso threaded through\nher prose.

Well the newest addition to the\nMarvel Cinematic Universe has this writer ready to switch passports.\nA\nrguably the\nmost anticipated film of\n2018 arrived\nlast week. Black Panther,\nthe latest addition to\nthe Marvel Cinematic\nUniverse canon, and\ndirected by Ryan Coogler,\nwas released in cinemas\nworldwide this February.\nBlack Panther is set in\nthe fictional country of\nWakanda, a technologically advanced nation\nin Sub-Saharan Africa\nwhich has separated itself\nfrom the rest of the world\nas a means to protect its\nimmense resources of\n\u2018vibranium\u2019, a fictitious\nelement which has\nfeatured many times in the\nMarvel mythos.\nThe film follows\nT\u2019Challa (Chadwick\nBoseman), who, upon\nthe death of his father the\nking, returns to take up\nthe mantle of the Black\nPanther, protector of\nthe realm. His authority\nand right to the throne,\nhowever, is challenged by\nErik Killmonger (Michael\nB. Jordan), an American-born usurper who\nseeks to bring Wakanda\nout of its isolationist ways\nand share its technology\nwith oppressed (read:\nblack) people across the\nglobe.\nA surface critique of\nthe film is that it follows\nthe formulaic pattern\nwhich has given Marvel\nfilms the large box office\nreturns they so often\ncommand \u2013 action,\ncomedy, and a dash of\nromance to boot (because\nwhy not). However, such\na rudimentary analysis of\nthe film fails to capture its\nmore nuanced facets.\nThe film touches on interesting points regarding\nmorality, good and evil:\nby removing colonialism\nand systemic injustices\nfrom the equation, the\nexistence of Wakanda\nallows for the presence\nof black people on screen\nwithout the burden of a\nplotline which includes\nracial injustice or oppres-sion. It shows a culture\n\u201cBlack Panther\nshows a\nsocietal\nframework\nfree from\nEuropean\ninfluences\u201d\nof people untainted and\nfree to evolve \u2013 the vision\nof an Africa in which advancement is not separate\nfrom tradition or culture;\na societal framework free\nfrom European influences.\nFurthermore, it is\narguably the women\nwho drive the plot: from\nOkoye (Danai Gurira)\nthe head of the Dora\nMilaje (the all-female\npalace guard), to Nakia\n(Lupita N\u2019yongo), covert\nWakandan agent and\nT\u2019Challa\u2019s love interest;\nnot to mention Ramonda\n(Angela Bassett) the\nQueen Mother or Princess\nShuri (Letitia Wright),\narguably the most brilliant\nmind in the country. The\nemphasis of black womanhood is clear, but very\nnoticeably without the\n\u2018strong independent black\nwoman who don\u2019t need\nno man\u2019 trope \u2013 these are\nall women whose actions\nspeak for them; fully\nrealised in their humanity,\nsomething that is often\nonly afforded to white\nmale characters.\nOf course, at its core,\nBlack Panther is a superhero film. And it squarely\nticks that box \u2013 the action\nsequences are breath-tak-ing (I\u2019m told even better\nin 3D), and the fight\nscenes are nothing short\nof bad-ass. But the beauty\nof the film comes in its\nsetting \u2013 for once in a\nsuperhero film the setting\nisn\u2019t New York City or a\nWestern metropolis. It\u2019s a\ndistinctly African country:\nthe architecture, the\nfashion, the soundtrack\nare all deliberately\ntailored to portray a rich\nand vibrant culture.\nOne thing that has\ncertainly mis-attributed\nto Black Panther is\nthat it is the first film to\nfeature a black superhero\n(see: Blade, Hancock),\nhowever that in no way\ndiminishes its cultural\nimportance: for many\npeople, this film is the first\nopportunity to see Africa\nand African culture as\nsomething to be celebrat-ed, particularly in light of\ncomments from President\nTrump referring to such\ncountries as \u201cshitholes\u201d.\nBlack Panther has\nprovided an opportunity\nto change perceptions of\nAfrica, as evidenced by\nthe hundreds of people\nshowing up to screenings\nin traditional African garb\n(myself included).\nBut it\u2019s also a story of\na longing for something\nunattainable. Part of the\nplot\u2019s undertone is the\ncomplex relationship of\nAfrican-Americans with\ntheir distant heritage;\nsimultaneously one of\nyearning and of antipathy.\nThrough this, the \u2018goodevil\u2019 narrative so native\nto the superhero genre is\nsubverted in the conflict\nbetween T\u2019Challa and\nKillmonger \u2013 at times,\nit is difficult to side with\neither.\nIf this is not convinc-ing, its performance at the\nbox office so far speaks\nfor itself: in the four-day\nperiod since opening\nit earned $427 million\nworldwide, surpassing\nthe returns from Justice\nLeague\u2019s entire run in\ntheatres. If nothing, this is\nproof that black stories do\nin fact, sell \u2013 something\nwhich Hollywood will do\nwell to remember.\nThe real triumph of\nBlack Panther is its\nsuccess in highlighting\nthat black culture is not in\nany way monolithic. In a\nuniverse in which Norse\ngods, alien empires, and\nprimordial mystic beings\nare freely explored, it is a\nrefreshing reminder of the\nwealth of story-telling that\ncan be gleaned from the\nvast repository of existing\ncultures here on Earth.\nDon\u2019t mess with them // Marvel\nFILM\nChimdi Igwe\nFilm Writer\nDir: Ryan Coogler.

I\u2019ve been considering a career in academia,\nbut this is seriously going\nto disadvantage people\nat a lower level. Those\nstriking are already in\nthe system, and they\u2019ve\nacquired a certain amount\nof pension pay, but for us\nthere won\u2019t be anything\nguaranteed if the changes\ngo through.\u201d\nThe concerns were\nechoed by Abhijay Sood,\nwho helped organise the\nstudent demonstration. He\ntold Felix: \u201cI\u2019m here to\nshow support for staff, not\nonly because I\u2019m worried\nabout their pensions, but\nselfishly too: as a student\nthis is bad for education\nin general, and especially\nbad for those of us who see\nourselves having future\ncareers in academia.\u201d\nLast week Union\nCouncil voted to support\nthe strikes, passing a\npaper that called on\n\u201celected representatives\nof ICU to support the\nUCU position\u201d. A number\nof student Union representatives were present\non the picket line on\nThursday morning, but\nnone of the paid Officer\nTrustees (OTs) \u2013 Union\nPresident and the four\nDeputy Presidents \u2013 were\nin attendance. Rhidian\nThomas, ICU\u2019s Ethics and\nEnvironmental Officer,\nsaid it was \u201cdisappointing\u201d they did not come:\n\u201cI\u2019m very grateful at the\nsupport the Union has\ngiven us so far, but I\u2019ve\nemailed them about this\na lot of times, they knew\nit was coming, and I\u2019m\nmore than a little annoyed\nthey\u2019ve not turned up.\u201d\nIn a statement for Felix,\na Union representative\nsaid: \u201cUnion Council\ndisruption to students is\nkept to a minimum. Our\nstudent leaders have been\nworking hard to achieve\nCouncil\u2019s objectives\nalongside continuing to\nrepresent and deliver for\nstudents at all levels.\u201d\nThe strikes are the culmination of a long-run-ning dispute between\nUCU and Universities UK\n(UUK), the group representing UK universities,\nover changes to pension\nschemes. Currently most\nhigher education institutions are part of the University Superannuation\nScheme (USS), a defined\nbenefit scheme in which\nemployers pay in up to a\ncertain amount.\nUUK want to switch\nto a defined contribution\nscheme, which would see\nemployees paying into\nthe pension pot, citing a\nfunding deficit of \u00a37.5\nbillion \u2013 a figure UCU\ndisputes. An analysis by\nProfessor Michael Otsuka\nof the London School of\nEconomics (LSE) suggests employees may lose\nup to 60% of their pension\nunder the new scheme.\nT\nhe decision by UUK to move to a\ndefined contribution scheme has\nrecently come under increased\nscrutiny, as they have been accused\nof disproportionately taking into account the\nviews of wealthy Oxbridge colleges.\nMichael Otsuka, a professor at the London\nSchool of Economics (LSE) has estimated\naround16Oxbridgecollegeswereincludedin\na key survey organised by UUK, which formed\nthe basis of switching pension schemes. In\nthe survey, which asked universities whether\nthey would prefer moving to a defined\ncontribution scheme that would offer less\nrisk to university finances, Oxbridge colleges\nwere more likely to support a scheme with\nlower risk.\nIn total, 42% of the 116 responses received\nin the survey were in favour of a less risky\nscheme. However, those 116 institutions\nincluded 16 Oxbridge colleges, as well as\nOxford and Cambridge themselves.\nT\nhis week also saw the circulation of\na petition from students asking for a\nportion of their tuition fees back. The\npetition, which started by students\nin the Electrical and Electronic Engineering\n(EEE) Department, was circulated amongst\nstudents by Imperial College Union (ICU)\nacademic representatives and members\nof College staff. At the time of writing, the\npetition has reached nearly 2000 signatures,\ndespite only being up for the past six hours.\nThe move comes as large numbers of\nstudents lobby their universities asking for\npartial refund of their fees. Earlier this week it\nwas reported that 70,000 students had signed\na number of petitions requesting money back\nat more than 30 universities, with the number\nof signatures rising at the rate of 10,000 per\nday.\nMany of those asking for refunds cite\nfrustration at the teaching they will miss, with\nUCU estimating that nearly 600,000 teaching\nhours will not be rescheduled. The frustration\nstudents feel about missing out on teaching\nis compounded by two other factors: the\nhigh fees many students pay, particularly\ninternational students; and the fact staff on\nstrike have their pay withheld. The Times\nhas estimated that Imperial could save up to\n\u00a3500,000 in staff costs over the duration of\nthe strike.\nUCU members voted\nlargely in favour of the\nindustrial action, with\n88% of those balloted\nsupporting a strike. At\nImperial 58.5% of UCU\nmembers voted, in line\nwith the national average.\nRepresentatives from\nthe UCU told Felix they\nhad been told by management the College could\nafford to continue the\npension scheme \u2013 which\nwould cost up to 10% of\ntheir excess income \u2013 but\nhad chosen not to.\nSood, who hoped the\nstrikes would encourage\nstudents to \u201cwrite to the\nProvost, and ask him to\ncome back to the negotiating table\u201d, highlighted\nthe impact Imperial could\nhave by supporting their\nstaff: \u201cI\u2019m hoping that\nby Wednesday UUK\nwith cede, and give their\ncurrent proposal a stay.\nBut some universities\nwill have more sway than\nothers, and Imperial is one\nof them. We\u2019re only going\nto get the strike stopped\nif Imperial College take\na position within UUK to\nmake a compromise.\u201d\nAlready a number of\nuniversity heads have\nasked UUK to come\nback to the negotiating\ntable, including Warwick,\nEssex, Loughborough,\nChief Financial Officer,\nand James Stirling, the\nCollege Provost, implies\nStirling misled staff when\nhe sent them an email\nlast October saying \u201cour\npreference would be to\nmaintain a defined benefit\nstructure for USS.\u201d The\nemail claims that three\nweeks earlier the College\nhad informed UUK they\nwould prefer \u201cmoving to a\ndefined contribution only\nsolution.\u201d\nThe email, which has\nbeen circulated among a\nnumber of staff, says this\nfinding \u201ccasts a cloud over\nyour statements of future\nintent in supporting a\nbetter pension for staff.\u201d It\ngoes on to say their position has \u201cshifted to one of\nincoherence \u2013 financially,\nhistorically, and morally\u201d,\nand asks them to be\n\u201chonest to staff\u201d about\npotential outcomes.\nA YouGov poll, organised on the eve of\nthe strikes, showed only\n2% of students thought\nuniversity staff were to\nblame for the dispute,\nand over 60% supported\nStudents ask for refund\nOxbridge overrepresented in UUK analysis\nthe strikes. This support\nwas higher in universities\nwhere strike action was\noccurring, despite potential reductions in teaching\ntime.\nThe impact the strikes\nhave had on students at\nImperial is unclear, since\nstaff are not obliged to\ninform the College they\nplan to strike. A large\nnumber of students have\nreceived emails from their\ndepartments informing\nthem to presume lectures\nare still on, although\nmany have had lectures or\ntutorials cancelled.\nIn a statement, a\nCollege representative\ntold Felix: \u201cWe appreciate students may have\nconcerns about potential\ndisruption but the College\nwill be open as usual and\ndepartments are working\nhard to ensure that teaching and assessment activities continue as normal.\nAny changes to schedules\nwill be communicated\nby Departments. Advice\nfor students is available\nonline.\u201d\n\u201cStudents\nchalked\nmessages of\nsupport in\nDalby Court,\nwatched by\nfaculty staff\u201d\nvoted to support the paper,\nand the Officer Trustees\nhave been achieving the\nobjectives that Council\ndemocratically set for\nthem. This did not include\na mandate to join the\npicket line. The Council\ndiscussion was clear that\nImperial College Union\nwould also work to ensure\n\u201cSenior staff\nhave accused\nCollege\nmanagement\nof misleading\nstaff\u201d\nLancaster, and Goldsmiths. Imperial College\nLondon have said the\npensions dispute is \u201ca\nnational dispute over\nwhich [we] have no direct\ncontrol.\u201d\nLast week College\nmanagement were\naccused of misleading\nstaff in an email from\na senior member of\nacademic staff.

What most\npeople don\u2019t know is that\nBangladesh is a country\nfull of rich history and\nculture, despite only being\n47-years-old this year.\nInitially it was recognised\nas \u2018East Pakistan\u2019 after\nthe British rule ended,\nbut the people of East\nPakistan wanted inde-pendence. International\nMother Language Day is\nofficially held on the 21st\nof February. This is to recognise the 1952 language\nmovement of Bangladesh,\nwhich involved the death\nof Bangladeshi University\nstudents for campaigning\nthe right to speak Bengali.\nBangladesh was founded\nin March 1971, after the\nBangladeshi liberation\nwar, or \u2018Muktijuddho\u2019.\nThis saw the death of over\n500,000 people, although\nnobody knows the exact\nnumber and Bangladesh\nGovernment figures\nsuggest this number can\nIC RADIO \u2013\nCOME AND GET\nINVOLVED!\nAre you in a band?\nWant to get more\nexposure? ICRadio has\nbe as high as three million.\nAs young British\nBangladeshis, this tragic\npast serves as a constant\nreminder to appreciate\nour heritage. In honour of\nthis, Imperial\u2019s very own\nBangladeshi Society have\nheld a range of events to\ncommemorate the wars.\nOn the week starting 19th\nFebruary, we held several\nstalls and exhibitions to\neducate other students\non this history. As part of\nthese stalls, we created a\nbanner for students to per-sonalise with their names\nin their own languages.\nThis banner was then\ntaken to Altab Ali park, on\nthe 21st\nFebruary, where\nImperial was joined by\nBangladeshi societies\nfrom other universities.\nEveryone came together\nto pay respects to students\nwho lost their lives for\nour language, and other\nfighters who fought for\nindependence. Our final\nflagship event \u2018Anupranito\u2019, meaning \u2018To Inspire\u2019\nwas held as means to\nconnect our extraordinary\nhistory to a future that\nholds a lot of potential. A\nrange of Bengali speakers\nfrom various fields were\nbrought in to discuss\ntheir success and inspire\nstudents both Bangladeshi\nand non-Bangladeshi\nalike.\nPerhaps the most\nrewarding aspect of all\nthe events, is that all proceedings will be donated\nto JAAGO, a charity\nthat supports educational\nprojects in Bangladesh\nwhile also providing\nopportunities for UK\nstudents to volunteer in\nBangladesh.\nWe hope this week has\nbeen a chance for you to\nlearn about the history of\nBangladesh and not just\n\u201cthat small country next\nto India\u201d.

She lives with her\nfamily in a small village,\nwhere more than half a\nyear may pass without a\ndrop of rain. During these\ndry spells, it is her daily\njob to fetch more than\ntwenty litres of water from\na creek four hours away.\nShe wants to go to school,\nbut cannot, because she\nhas to walk so far to\ngather water. Christina is\nonly ten.\nThere are many\nchildren like Christina\nin the rural villages of\nTanzania. The climate\nof Tanzania has a pitiful\nannual rainfall, hence\nwater scarcity is one of the\ngreatest problems faced\nby the local community.\nThis is where we enter the\nstory.\nFounded in 2002 by\ntwo Imperial students,\nthe student-led charity\nRaincatcher Imperial has\nsince completed 14 major\nsummer projects and\nclocked over 12,096 hours\nin Tanzania. We have constructed numerous rainwater harvesting systems and\nprovided essential water\nand sanitation training\nall around Tabora. More\nthan two million litres of\nrainwater harvesting capabilities have been built,\nbenefiting thousands of\nrural villagers, essentially\nremoving the arduous trip\nChristina and the other\ncountless children have to\ntake daily.\nThis year, we are\nmoving our focus to\nZeze, a rural village in\nthe Kasulu district of\nTanzania. After extensive\nresearch, boreholes have\nbeen identified to be more\neffective than rainwater\nharvesting to solve water\nscarcity (And no, we\nwill not be changing\nour name to Boreholer\nImperial). Therefore,\nin the coming summer,\nwe will be spending up\nto eight weeks in Zeze\nconstructing boreholes\nwith the local community.\nFurthermore, we will set\nup locally-sourced, sustainable bio-sand filters\nand, conduct hygiene\nand microfinance courses\nfor the local people. We\nmight even hold a science\ncamp for the local school!\nBefore travelling to\nZeze, we are organising\nfundraising events and\napplying for sponsorships\nthroughout the whole\nyear to fund our research\nand summer trip. Our\nupcoming fundraising\nevent is the absolute\nhighlight of the year, the\nannual Water Walk!\nWater Walk 2018 will\nbe held on the 3rd\nMarch,\nto commemorate the\nUN World Water Day, in\nadvance. In order to raise\nawareness of water related\nissues in Tanzania, we\nwill be carrying ten litres\nof water each and walking\nten miles across Central\nLondon. Participants will\nget a taste of what the daily\nwater collection trek feels\nlike. All our fundraising\nevents are open to public,\nso feel free to get involved\nwith your friends, family,\nneighbours, and pets!\nWalk for water, volunteer for water.

The police estimated\nthat upwards of 517,000\nsexual offences occur\neach year in England and\nWales and yet the CPS\nonly managed to convict\na perpetrator in 10,721\ncases in 2016/17 \u2013 that\u2019s\nonly 2%.\nRecent events have\nbrought the issue of rape\nand sexual assault into\nthe public spotlight, and\nwith dismay have we seen\npublic figures exposed\nfor their abuse of power.\nRightfully so we should\nbe outraged at them and\ntheir actions; but we\ncannot solely be outraged\nat the perpetrators, we\nmust acknowledge the\nrole the criminal justice\nsystem (CJS) has played\nin allowing the perpetrators to go unchecked. We\nmust not blame victims\nfor not coming forward\n\u2013 victim-blaming is toxic\nand damaging. Instead\nwe must hold our CJS accountable for having had\npolicies in place that did\nnot allow for a fair trial,\nand left victims feeling\nsilenced. And let us never\nforget what researchers\nfound when analysing\nthe institutional culture\nat Imperial: \u201cDespite\nImperial\u2019s \u2018no tolerance\u2019\nstance on harassment\nand bullying, women in\nparticular reported being\nsilenced in various ways.\u201d\nAn often-cited reason\nfor perpetrators evading\nconviction is that victims\nneed to speak up more\nand go to the police. Let\u2019s\nexplore this statement by\ntrying to understand what\nhappens when victims do\ngo to the police. From\nOct 2016 to Sep 2017 the\npolice recorded 48,773\nrape offences, an increase\nof 29% on last year. The\npolice then assigned\nan \u201coutcome\u201d to each\nreported case. Rape case\noutcomes in the year\nending March 2016, as of\nJuly 2017 (1 year and 3\nmonths later) included:\n\u2022 ~25% of cases had\nstill not been assigned an\noutcome, i.e. after 1 year\nand 3 months the police\nhad still not decided what\nto do.\n\u2022 ~35% of cases faced\nevidential difficulties\nwhere the victim did not\nsupport action \u2013 what are\nthe police doing to make\n35% of victims that went\nto the police for justice\nlater withdraw support?\n\u2022 Only ~10% resulted in\na suspect being charged or\nsummonsed. This needs\nto be seen in context of\nthe police identifying a\nsuspect in at least 96% of\nrape cases\nCases with a charged\nor summonsed suspect\nwill be brought to court\nby the CPS. With a long\ninvestigation period,\nonly a small fraction of\nreported cases resulting in\na suspect being charged,\nand the fact that fake rape\naccusations almost never\nhappen one would expect\nthat once in court, cases\nwould be resolved quickly\nand almost always end\nin a conviction. But no,\nof the 5190 cases of rape\nthe CPS completed in\n2016-17, the prosecution was unsuccessful a\nshocking 42.4% of the\ntime, only managing a\nconviction in 2991 of the\ncases. In addition \u201cthe\nmedian number of days\nfor rape offences to be\nassigned an outcome was\n144 days\u201d; the median\ntime taken from charge to\ncompletion for rape cases\nwas 259 days, and has\nincreased every year since\n2010. 259 days + 144 days\n= 403 days. And that\u2019s just\nthe median; being unlucky\ncan mean waiting much,\nmuch longer. Requiring\nanyone going through a\nrape trial to wait such a\nlong time is just not fair.\n48,773 cases of rape\nreported are to the\npolice, and only 2,991\nit includes non-recent\ncases). It would therefore\nbe misleading to think\nthat 48773/95000=51%\nof incidents last year were\nreported to the police.\nFor consistency I simply\npresented the most recent\ndata.\nIt is important to\nremember in this discussion that while the system\ncan still get better, it has\nmost definitely been\nimproving a lot over the\nlast ten years. In 2016-17,\nas compared to 2007-08,\nprosecutions for Violence\nAgainst Women and Girls\nhave increased by 48.8%,\nwith a corresponding\n62.7% increase in convictions (from 51,974\nconvictions to 84,565);\nconvictions for sexual\noffences including rape\nand child sexual abuse is\nup 71.5% over the same\nperiod. The CPS has published the report \u201cRape\nAction Plan\u201d to outline\ntangible changes being\nmade to make court cases\nfairer, including this reassuring message: \u201cshifting\nthe focus away from the\ncredibility of the victim\nto the credibility of the\noverall allegation. This\nwill also involve consideration of the behaviour\nof the defendant including\naround seeking consent\u201d.\nI think Imperial should\nincorporate this thinking\nwhen dealing with sexual\nharassment and assault.\nImprovements in police\nreporting standards, and\nhigh-profile cases like\nOperation Yewtree and\n#metoo, have encouraged\nmore victims to come\nforward; but this is putting\nthe system under pressure,\ncausing case completion\ntimes to increase and conviction rates to decrease.\nIf the police and CPS\nOutcomes asssigned to rape offences in the year ending March 2016 //Home Office\nconvictions by the CPS in\n2016/17. And then there\u2019s\nthe issue of secondary\nvictimisation, yet another\naspect making interacting\nwith the judicial system\neven more painful. Hopefully this will show that\nencouraging more victims\nto come forward is not\nenough. We need lasting\npolicy change to make the\nCJS perform much better\nthan it is now.\nNote that due to the\naggregate publishing of\ndata, tracking of individual cases is impossible, thus\nthe number of reported\ncases in 2016/17 will not\nbe directly comparable\nwith the number of convictions in 2016/17, as\ncases take a long time to\ncomplete. \u201cTotal reported\ncases in 2016/17\u201d refers\nto when the incident is\nreported, not when the\nincident took place (i.e.\nHow we sometimes want to do too much, and\nwhat we can do about it\nComment writer Abdulrahman Alhadad talks about the subtle difference between working a\nlot and giving a lot.\nW\ne often\nhear the\ncriticisms\nof others\ntelling us that we do not\ndo enough of what we\nare supposed to. Seldom,\nhowever, do the words,\n\u201cyou have to do less\u201d fall\nupon our ears.\nIn a society where\nmore is merrier, and\nbigger is better, we strive\nto accumulate all that we\nCOMMENT\nAbdulrahman\nAlhadad\nComment Writer\ncan as fast as we can. This\nmeans more studying for\nstudents, more exercising\nto reach our fitness goals,\nand more work to earn\nmore money! Therein\narise the terms workaholic\nand the like, which our\ndisdain for is nothing\nmore than a pseudo-at-tempt to ease our minds at\nthe mention of those who\nare bigger and better than\nourselves. Deep down\ninside, however, we find\nour inner voice questioning itself, asking itself\n\u201chow do they do it?\u201d\nI, for one, have lived\nand breathed the negative\nsides of too much. For\nmonths on end, I worked\nand worked. Praised by\nmy family, friends, and\nacquaintances on my\nprogress, those were but\nempty words falling upon\ndeaf ears. I wanted more.\nAnd so, to get more, one\nmust do more, I guessed.\nBut how wrong I was\u2026\nAttached to the good\nblessings that I accumulated from simply not\ntrying, I could not accept\nthat what was in my hands\nwas steadily and surely\nslipping away like sand.\nI worked day and night,\ngrabbing onto every\npassing grain; and the\nmore I focused on holding\nonto one, the more the\nrest slipped beyond my\nvision. I was too blind to\nsee that the road I was to\ntake was of another colour\nand, better yet, of another\nworld.\nLESS!!\nLess was the route I\nshould have taken embarking on my long and\narduous journey. Walk\nslower, take it easier,\nworry less! Less is the\nmentality of a runner,\nrealising that a marathon\nis not to be sprinted. Less,\ndeclare the words of a\nwriter cutting down to\nlinguistic perfection. Less\nflows the hand of an artist\nsculpting a grand masterpiece to a fault of none.As\nAntoine de Sant-Exupery\nwould say, \u201cperfection is\nachieved not when there\nis nothing more to add,\nbut when there is nothing\nleft to take away.\u201d\nBut one may ask, what\nif I want to get there\nfaster? What if I want to\nreach the end in half the\ntime? Is more not then\nthe solution? I never said\nto work less, but rather to\nworry less. As a sprinter\nwho trains to reach the\nfinish line quicker, so must\nyou first train your ability\nto accept results as they\ncome in order to further\nyourself. Focus not on\nattaining more, as there is\nsimply too much out there\nto be attained, but rather\non giving more, as that\nis in plentiful abundance,\nand how sweet the fruit\nof the labour of giving.\nConquer, and there will\nalways be those who have\nconquered more. Find,\nand yet persists the fear\nof losing. Give, however,\nand you need never worry\nabout keeping. Give,\nand you will effortlessly\nbe brought closer to the\nthings and ones you love.\nIs that not truly why we\nwork?\nneed more resources I\nhope #metoo can be an\noccasion for the public\nto realise that maybe we\nshould give that to them.\nBut the CJS still isn\u2019t\nperfect, and that\u2019s where\nImperial comes into the\npicture: for women, being\na full-time student in the\nUK is associated with a\n6.8% increased risk of\nvictimisation. I think both\nImperial College Union\nand the College need to\nplay a role in making\nImperial safer.\nTwo years ago, Emily-Jane Cramphorn, our\nformer Deputy President\n(Welfare), posted an\narticle called \u201cBlurred\nlines?\u201d in which she\nargues: \u201cA lack of education and discussion about\nsex and consent sits at\nthe core of rape culture\nand until we address this\nnothing will change.\u201d I\nagree that open discussion\nis crucial, but I think there\nis a flaw in thinking like\nthis about rape culture:\nIt allows perpetrators to\nargue that they \u201cweren\u2019t\neducated on the fact that\nit\u2019s wrong to physically\nattack others\u201d, and it leads\nto these traumatising\nattacks being treated as\nmisunderstandings. An\nattack is never a misun-derstanding. Ignorance of\nthe law should never be\nan excuse. According to\nLundy Bancroft, consultant on domestic abuse,\nauthor, and winner of\nthe 2004 Pro Humanitate\nLiterary Award:\n\u201cAn abuser almost\nnever does anything that\nhe himself considers\nmorally unacceptable\u2026\nan abuser\u2019s core problem\nis that he has a distorted\nsense of right and wrong\u201d\nAny abuser found\nguilty by Imperial obviously needs to realise that\nwhat they did was wrong,\nbut since Imperial is not\na prison, I do not believe\nImperial should ever act as\na correctional institution\ne.g. by issuing consent\ntraining. Expulsion is both\nfairer and safer.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong:\nI understand the utopian\ndream as presented by\nCramphorn that education\nwill prevent a person from\ndoing wrong things in the\nfirst place but preventing\na person\u2019s first offence is\nan incredibly complicated\nissue. Given the scale\nof the issue, and the\noutrageous prevalence\nof repeat offenders, let\u2019s\nstart with what would also\nhave a great impact, but\nwould be much easier:\npreventing subsequent\nattacks from the same\nperson.\nsexual advances, defined\nas inappropriate touching\nand groping. Imperial has\nroughly 17000 students,\nso one would expect\nroughly 4420 Imperial\nstudents to have experienced such an incident.\nA freedom of information\nrequest revealed that the\nnumber of sexual har-assment/sexual assault/\nrape complaints dealt\nwith by the College\nbetween 2010\u20132017, in\ntotal was 11. This would\nlead us to believe that\nroughly 0.25% of sexual\nharassment/assault cases\nare reported to Imperial.\nClearly there\u2019s room for\nimprovement.\nLaw and policy change\nat a societal level is difficult and cumbersome but\ngiven the current state of\nhow the judicial system\nhandles sexual miscon-duct, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s\ndefensible for Imperial to\nnot take serious measures\nto curb these crimes\nfrom happening on their\ngrounds by their students.\nA frequently cited reason\nfor not reporting such\na crime to the police is\nthat they \u201cdidn\u2019t think\nthe police could do\nmuch to help\u201d. I think\nImperial should implement a system so good\nat dealing with sexual\nharassment and assault\nthat any Imperial student\nwho doesn\u2019t believe in\nthe police\u2019s ability to\nhelp them will go to the\nCollege instead. A system\nso good that no Imperial\nstudent will ever think of\nsuch a crime as being \u201ctoo\ntrivial to report\u201d: a barrier\nidentified in the recent\nsexual assault and consent\nsurvey at Imperial. I hope\nImperial will consider the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 Implement an\nanonymous reporting\nsystem equivalent to the\none already available for\nImperial staff. Students\ndon\u2019t want to be harassed,\ndiscriminated or bullied\neither.\n\u2022 Disallow the\nUnion from handling\ncases involving sexual\nmisconduct since only\nthe College can expel\nstudents. This would\nprevent serious cases from\never being passed back\nand forth between the\nUnion and the College,\nthus curbing distress.\nCurrently, under 17%\nof the Imperial Student\nDisciplinary Procedure\nfrom 2017, the Union\nis \u201cexpected\u201d to let the\nCollege deal with serious\nincidents on Union\ngrounds, but I think these\ncases should be handed\nover by default, not by\nexpectation.\n\u2022 Accountability:\nTangible and public\npromises. I think Imperial\nshould issue a promise\nof how quickly they will\nresolve cases. This could\nbe of the form \u201cconfirmation receipt of your\ncomplaint within 24hr\u201d\nand \u201ccompletion of X type\nof case within Y months.\u201d\nThis will give victims an\nidea of what to expect\nfrom the College and give\nthe entirety of the student\nbody tangible metrics to\nhold the College procedural system accountable\nto.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think\nit\u2019s reasonable\nfor Imperial\nto not take\nserious\nmeasures to\nprevent these\ncrimes\u201d\nRoughly one in four\n(26%) of students at\nUK universities have\nsuffered unwelcome\n\n"
