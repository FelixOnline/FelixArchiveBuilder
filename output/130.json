    "content": "PARADISE E NOW A PERSONAL VIET OP THE GUILD'S CARNIVAL*\n\"Oh, it's simply wonderful\" said\na pretty girl, leaning on the arm of a rather grim-looking gentleman who was\nin expertly clutching a wooden cutlass.\nShe was admiring this year's decoration)\nfor the Guild's Carnival - \"Pirates\nParadise\". And wonderful they were,\ntoo - certainly, that Concert Hall has\nnever before been so expertly disguised\nand turned so realistically into something other than its real, forbidding,\nself.\nFor the benefit of those so unlucky as not to have seen this trans-formation, perhaps I had better explain.\nThe entire Conoert Hall had been turned\ninto the fore deck of a pirate galleon\nthe stage forming the quarterdeck.\nThe wooden floor of the hall was the\nonly unchanged feature that could be\nrecognised, serving as the actual deck\nof the ship. Looking over the scuppers\nof this Imperial Galleon, one could see\nislands and a most sanguine sunset on\nthe port quarter. Mermaids draped\nthemselves around in poses reminiscent\nof some soap advertisement and to complete the effect, a flimsy muslin roof\nhid the clinical lights and roof of the\nerstwhile Hall from view. Fortunately\nthe realistic sea was realistically\no alm and no-one was realistically sea-sick.\nThe construction of a large and\nefficient bar on the landing outside\nthe entrance to the Concert Hall was\na very welcome feature and prevented\nincidents interfering with the revels,\nIn the Upper Dining Hall the cats\nwere busy around the jazz band and\nwhen the Jive Competition began it was really something to see (some of\nthe men were good too! 1\nCABARET\nEvery Carnival has a cabaret, of\no our se.A Carnival Cabaret may be defined as follows: \"A piece of entertainment which worries the life out of its producer, scares the life out of those\ntaking part, and is shouted down by the\naudi e now an the night*- unless you-take\nspecial precautions. This cabaret had\ntwo special features - talent and Mike\nNewaon. This is not to say, of o our se, that Mr. Newson is not talented - who\ndoubts this?, but he made a spectacular\nMaster of Ceremonies in a genuine\n\"Treasure Island* type outfit, wh i oh looked much better when he played the\nclarinet; so natural did he look that\none felt that all pirates must have\nplayed clarinets as a matter of course\n- and he could handle the audience.\nThe other and more striking\nfeature of this entertainment was the\ntalent. Derek Bayliss, the producer,\nhad drawn widely in Guilds for both\ncast and material, with 'the result\nthat he managed to produce something\nvery like a short review.\nIgnoring some loutish R.C.S. interruptions, it is safe to say\nthat there were no spontaneous outbursts from the audience - they\nlistened to the cabaret, and enjoyed\nlistening, which is a great tribute\nto its producer and his oas t. As to the material provided for\nour entertainment - there ware two,\nand only two, weak spots; firstly the\n\u2022Dreadful Night\" sketch wh i oh, waa so\nold that the audience spoilt it by\nsupplying the punch line and secondly\na rather curious Quatermass sketch (?)\n- this appeared to puzzle those taking\npart as much as the audience, so\neveryone felt at home. One o an only\nwish that the end-product of all our\nam experiments could be as interesting,\nall the same.\nPersonally speaking, I would vote\nas the best sketch that in which a very\npolished (and slightly slimy?) Guildsman, armed only with his charm and a telephone, persuaded a rather blas e young lady to come to the carnival -in pyjamas: \"to save time\" he explain-ed.\nDerek Bayliss avoided that bugbear of the cabaret producer - a flat\nlast sketch - by providing a very\noriginal version of an Irving Berlin\nsong. This also served to fill the\nstage with Guildsmen and these, led\nby their President - Dava Clarkgave the audie no ea rousing Boomalaka as a final offering.\nFOOD\nThe writer would like to make a personal plea for better arrangements\nof the food in future - it waa vary\ndifficult for anyone not in the front\nline to get as much as a smell of a sud wi oh smaller tables and a mora\nopen arrangement of the existing\ntables would have been better - also,\nsomewhere to sit would have been appreciated on the other hand, maybe\nI'm just getting old and less push-full. Remarks about other carnival\ncabarets are in video us they are not\nintended as major works of art - but\nto be enjoyed at the moment they are\ngiven and no longer.\nAn example of the excellent flats*\n\n"

    "content": "FEUX\nSlG RIDES AGAIN *\nThe well-known Chinese idiot, Lo\nSlung once made the very wise remark:\n\"There is a oh ink in every Chinaman's armour\". This is true, of o our se, but\nthere is a brighter side, as the monkey ^*\nsaid when he looked in the mirror.\nM The Chinese contribution to culture, Iw hio hI skimmed over last week is little known to the Western .mind. To the West,\nthe greatness of China ia measured by\nthe fame of her dynasties ; Thus, me\nhave the maj est io Tang, the powerful\nKing and the intolerable Pong.\nThis Pong, which spread wherever\nthe Trade Winds blew, struck terror into\nthe hearts of mediaeval sanitary inspectors from Bankok to Mandalay.\nI wish to refer to this period in\nparticular, for it is at this time that\ngravity was invented by the wise and\nnauseating Emperor Wun Long Fling. He\nwished to do a kindly act every day,\nalthough the best thing he could have\ndone, he refused to do on the grounds\nthat it was too painful.\nEventually he ran out of ideas - at\nleast on some subjects and called all the wise men of china (and of glass) to\ncome and make public postulations before\nhim. Those that refused, and some did\nso, mainly on hygienic grounds, he\ntreated mero i fully, which was a dreadful\nway to die. Eventually, this same Lo\nSlung of whom I have before spoken, came\nbefore His Most Munificent Majesty and\ndecided that he liked chop suey too\nmuch to give up easily.\n\"Postulate\" said HMMM. After a slight\npause, Lo said:\"Consider worms, sire\"\n\"Warms?\"\n\"Worms\"\n\"Hum\" said HMMM. \"Proceed\" (He did'nt get\nit either)\n\"Well, you think of a worm travelling\nhappily through the soil, suppose the\npoor creature, who thinks that he is\ntravelling in the direction of UP, is\nin fact travelling in the Direction of\nDown. Eventually, of course, the poor\nanimal will go mad. If you wish to be\na real M.M, surely you could do some\nthing for the poor things.\"\nAnd so the Emperor issued an edi ot abolishing gravity. When they had\nall come down off the ceiling, and Lo\nSlung was beginning to feel a bit out\nup, the entire court found themselves\nup to the knees in worms, all proceeding in the general direction of Up.\nThis problem became too annoying,\nand to rid himself of the Annelid\nAggrevators, the Emperor?\u00bbras forced to\ncall out the 4th, Imperial Anti-worm\nRegiment of Boot. See next issue\nENGINEERS DINNER& DANCE ZCT- FEBRUARY JAZZ CLUB\nAt the beginning of this term the\nJazz Club found itself without a President, a sad thing as this meant\nthat it had lost a certain Mr. Dennis\nLeston. The amount of work which Mr\nLeston put into the Club was probably\nnot fully appreciated, but his interest,\nenthusiasm and leadership sparked off\nan upward trend in club affairs wh i oh has continued steadily ever since.\nThis term has shown continued\nsuccess. The good audiences at Thursday record recitals show that there is\na large number of people in the College\nwho are seriously interested in jazz.\nApart from these, many people, who have\nonly a little interest in the music,\nhave been seen to know what the club\nis doing. As usual groups are in\ngreat demand far Saturday night hops.\nTalks given so far this term have\nbeen under the titles of 'O.D. J.B. to\nM.J. Q.'( Tony Brookes), 'HardBee',\n(Richard Rushton), and 'Listening to\nModem Jazz' (Stan Salmons). A Bringyour-own-rao ard s type of programme\nproduced a wide range of music and\nwas well attended. Talks in line\nfor future meetings include 'Count\nBasis' by Dave Hills, 'Dave Brubeok1\nby Stan Salmons, and possibly 'Louis\nArmstrong' by Gordon Pritohard. A lunch hour concert will be produced\nlater this term.\nThis term has unfortunately seen\nthe decline of the 'Trad band', (due\nmainly to lack of interest on the part\nof certain members), but the small\nmodern and mainstream groups are still very active. Modern trios and quartets have been providing music for\nquiet listening and dancing at the hops\nand as usual a small group of dedicated\njazz men played their way through Guilds\nCarnival until 6.00 in the morning.\nA mainstream group under the leadership of Tony Newstead has been entered\nfor the W.U. S. Jazz Band Competition\norganised by N.E.C. After the preliminary judging the bands men have mixed\nideas about their chances of reaching\nthe final; anyone with an interest in\njazz and an ear for good musicianship\nwould have no doubts about giving the\nband a place in the final, but the views\nand standards of the judging panel were\nso pa the tio ally naive as to be almost\nun believe able. However, if the band\ndoes reach the final (wh i oh is being\njudged by Ken Colyer (!) on the 25th of this month) then it is hoped that\na large number of supporters will also\nbe able to make the trip to N.E.C. Meanwhile anyone who is interested in jazz music of any type, is invited to come along to our lunch-time\nmeeting in Room 208 of Guilds (second\nfloor).\nEDITOR'S NOTE\nThe above report was written by\nGordon Pritohard. It is typical that\nhe omitted to mention that in fact he\nhas been elected as su coe s s or to Dennis\nLeston (at least, as far as jazz is\nconcerned). Gordon is a very well-known figure around I.C. and where\nthere is Jazz, he is never far away\nThe success of jazz in this College\nis due in no small way to the consistent high standard of drumming which\nprovides the background to the hops,\njazz concerts and carnivals and recitals around I.C.

If\nonly a few show any sign of possessing\nany creative talents are they to be\nblamed for doing so?\nI feel that many of the grumblers\nare just jealous of the Phoenix Board.\nThose people who o an not even write decent English are harbouring a childish\nresentment towards those who can, and\ndo, write good literature (doe a the cap\nfit, Mr. Bramley?)

I do feel, how veer, that more than sufficient Space has been given to the Phoenix\nproblem and all correspondence on this\ntopic is closed.\nThere is also a annotation about \"A tale told by an idiot\".\nA new Musical Play, by\nALAN & AVRIL LEWIS,\nwill be presented by the Dramatic Society\non 28th.,29 th., and 50th APRIL in the\nUnion Concert Hall.\nBLEEDING HEART\nDear Sir,\nSince you have not yet (for\nshame) instituted a \"personal column\"\nin your publication, I must make use of\nyour correspondence space to pour out my\nheart's misery to a third person. .If,\ntherefore, this epistle mystifies you,\npray comfort yourself that there will\nbe, among your readers, one fair soul\nto whom my meaning will' be as clear as\nthe light of day. While providing an\nadditional activity for the student,\nwhose naturally inquisitive mind\ndelights in the dark mysteries of her\nfriends private lives. Let me explain:\nI, too, am preoccupied with mystery, and,\nalas, with irony. Imagine, if you will,\nthe strange excitement of a succession\nof disturbing encounters with an angelic\napparition. To say that she was\nattractive would be commonplace, rather\nshe wore about her that aura of subtle\nmagnetism that is at once vivacious\nand demure, that rare amalgam of mature\nwickedness and virginal innocence.\nWherever I went she haunted me:\nthe sudden direct look from those sparkling eyes that flashed across the crowded lounge, the secretive half smile\nthat touched the generous mouth, on\nthe taut silent journey in the lift. Who was she, my mystery girl?\nI could bear the strain no longer,\nI had to know her identity. I dared to\nask, and the spell was broken, the dream\na memory. Try as I might to recapture the\nfirst magical thrill, it remained elusive.\nThe encounters ceased. I was lost and\nalone in a crowd of \"insensitive louts*\nYet, even into the abyss of despair\nthere came, light (was it the quality of\nmercy that follows contrition?)

It has\nalready been decided that the Carnival\nshould consist of a Float Procession\nthrough the West End (with Police per-mission) and a Garden Fete involving\nstalls, sideshows, performances by\njazz bands etc., and a fancy dress com-petitions.\nW.U.

Although this is not\nstrictly correct I have been of the\nopinion for several months past that we\ncould certainly do more. Consequently,\nSt. George's Hospital has been contacted\nwith view to endowing an Imperial College Bed in that hospital.

Union will therefore\norganise, commencing in the Summer term\nof 1960, an Annual Garden Party and\nFete. The object will be to raise\nmoney to endow a bed in St. George's Hospital, as outlined above, and the\nFete will be held, with the permission\nof the Rector, in Princes Gardens.\nThe idea is not to raise all the money\nfrom the students but from local residents and shopkeepers etc. This will\ncommence on a Monday, and the fe te will\nbe held on the Saturday afternoon of\nthe same week, concluding with a dance\nin the evening.\nAlthough the College 'vehicles'\nwill be on the road, this will NOT be\nanother Field Cup Day, nor a Rag Day,\nbut will be an I.C. Fete, and for once\nwe shall know the exact destination of\nthe money that we raise. I shall very\nsoon be contacting the Presidents of\nother Colleges and universities in this country in order to benefit from\ntheir experience, but this does not\nmean that I do not want your ideas.\nAnyone with experience of such an\nevent, or with ideas, however small,\nis invaluable if this venture is to be\na success.\nR.H. T. GARNETT\nPresident, I.C.U. DEATH OF A FRIEND The death of Mr. F.W. James on the\n26th. of last month, at the untimely age\nof 48, has deprived this college of a well-known and liked figure. His loss\nwill be particularly felt by the overseas students, in whom he always took\na great interest.\nFrancis Wogan James came to the\nICollege in 1230, on a Royal Scholarship\nfrom Haverford West. He graduated in Chemistry in1933* In 1936, he became\nResearch Assistant in Highway Engineering.\nHe was of the opinion, however,\nthat he could be of mare use as an\ninterpreter of other peoples work and\napplied for the post of Assistant\nlibrarian. Within a short time, he was\nLibrarian of the Unwin Library.\nIn 1941, he joined the Army and\nserved in the RASC, RA0C and as Captain\nin the RBME - he was especially oc no er ned with e leo trio al circuits,and radar, in\nparticular.\nMr. James returned to the College\nin 1946, to re-apply his great knowledge\nand ability to interpret literature.\nSince 1952, he has been the Treasurer\nof the the A.C.C. and since October,\n1958, he was the Chief Librarian of the\nCollege in charge of all the individual\nlibraries.\nUNION MEETING An Imperial College Union Meeting\ni* to be held in the Concert Hall on\nThursday, February 24th.1959. A motion,for discussion at the\nUnion Meeting reads as follows:\u2022This Union should commit the\nmascots of the three constituent\ncolleges to a place of reverence and\nsafety, and that they should be left\nthere as a symbol of the hooliganism\nof the past.\"\nThis promises to be a Union\nMeeting well worth attending.\n\n"

    "content": "FEU X3 THROUGH A VJSirOJiS EYES\nWhan a foreign student arrives at\nthe University of London, he is immediately struck by its international\ncharacter. This character probably\nvaries according to the College, bat\nat the L.S.E.,.. for example, where I have spent one ten*, students of the\nCommonwealth rub shoulders with those\nfrom the Continent and the oo unt rj. es\nof Latin-America, to mention only a few. Here, there is a source of\nvery worth-while contacts, which the\nEnglish students themselves must find\nprofitable.\nStrikingly opposed to this Cosmopolitan atmosphere is the narrow\ncommunity of the College, which is the framework of student life. In\nthe Continental University, social\ncontacts between the faculties are\nreduced to a minimum, particularly\nin the large towns - the students\nscarcely know their professors, or\neach other. The English solidarity,\nway of thinking, and even form of\neveryday life exist only in the\nspecialised schools, such as the.\nPolyteohnique, Centrals or the\nHautes Etudes Conaerciales.\nIn England, on the contrary,\nthe social activities of the College are considerable. The students\nare go up ed in extremely diversified\nsocieties, whether they be re\u00a3*gi\u00abos\npolitical, geographical or athletic\nthis custom of, societies is certainly\nvery fruitful, for it allows a pao plat to group themselves according to their\ntastes,-and develops the information as\nwell as mutual understanding. Debates\nfollowed by a vote on the motion are\nalso a typical institution which has the\nsame end, and which has at the same time\nthe advantage of being an apprenticeship\nfor political life! The students' association benefit\nfrom the support and collaboration of\nnearly all the students: they have at\ntheir disposal important material means,\nwhich in the case of so i cnt if io college\nsuch as I.C. may be very sizeable.\nIn France, the societies of the\nFaculties have only a small influence,\nand very weak means of action: they\nprefer to form political syndicates,\nfrom which heated disputes between the\ndifferent opinions emerge - and this\nperhaps may be considered as another\ntype of initiation int- politics.\nThis intense social activity is the\nEnglish University is even more remarkable as the Colleges there are less\nspecialised than the Ccjxti&an taJ. ones:\nthe latter base only aUto j for w \u00abf sub\njeers ^e.g. arts, leaf, OrTkalcine etc) But at the L.S.E., for instance, the\ndiversity of the syllabuses\" is astonish-ing, and ranges from psychology to\nfiscal law with more than 600 regular\ncourses. After a brief stay,\u2022Ioan hardly judge English teaching: my\nimpression, however, is that it is\nquite practical, even prag a a tie, and\nvery complete and thorough.\nIn judiciary and political economics, I can say that the contact was\ncarefully maintained between the activity and the corresponding social\nmilieus this is certainly a fruitful\nmethod.\nBnfin, last but not least, the\nforeign student always finds a supplementary attraction in the generous and\ncordial welcome which his London friends\nkeep for him.\nJJ. HOUSTON\n* LT T.&D BR* MOTION\n\"That this House should ba\nadjourned indefinitely.*\nLast Thursday the House had the\npleasure of an excellent speech (a maiden) from that hoary old batch e lar Dave Jackson. Proposing the motion,\nhe said: \"If this House adjourned,\nwhere would it adjourn to? To the pub)\nto drink beer.\" Whereupon he produced\nthree bottles of beer: one far the\nchairman, one far his second er, Peter\nJarnan, and one which he kept for him-self. \"I have something for the\nopposition as well,\" he said, and duly\npresented them with two bottles of\npineapple juice.\nMr. Christopher May, opposing the\nnotion, oar o fully analysed the word\nindefinitely. Mr. Peter Jarman, on\nthe other hand, sub t ely twisted the\nmotion with a most outrageous piece of\nverbal Jiggery-poker y. This he supported with a somewhat tortuous a rgu ment, apparently involving the death\nof George II from over straining in a Water Closet.\nIn view of Mr. Jarman'\u2022 dreadful\nillogical it y, Bob Finch, who was also\nresponsible far this utterly unbiased\nreport, had to light the gleaming\nbeacon of truth, in a brilliant(and\nmodest)oration.\n(embers of t Sf House a A la Sua\ndemonstrated that they could only\nspeak on a serious motion.\nIn his third summing up Mr.\nJarman finally succeeded in extinguishing Mr. Finch's beacon of\nt rh th, by employing unlimited numbers\nof water closets and by declaring\nthat +>\u00bb- ~\u00bb\u00bbr meant that the\nHouse would meet again frequently.\nIn view of this interpretation of\nthe action, and because it was carried,\nthe Debates Committee graciously accepts\nthe verdict of the House, and is spurred\non to even greater enterprises.\nIs connection with these enterprises the President of Debates wishes,\nto deny rumours that he has been engaged.\nupon twisting the arms of Messrs. Kasslezj\nand Clark. He would like to point out,\nhowever, -that the two presidents have\nagreed to speak upon the motion:\n\"That this House prefers Thermometers\nto Spanners,\" later this month.\nBOB FINCH,\nPresident of Debates.\nWINTER JOURNEY\\ \u00b0 by Q\\ f for<L0< Ufs\n\\ TUESDAY24* FEB\nGO NCH KT HALL<*73 W Ll FNTRANCE\nFREE\nA Rehearsed f&w nge vi.c. p.s. CJUo-pot uCd Meedie\nThere was a very poor.response to\nthe offer of psych i \u2022+rio treatment and\nadvice given by '\u2022\u2022ll ul k. It seems\nthat the students at I.C. are on the\nwhole content with their characters\nand have only very minor problems.\nWaTlwlk has kindly consented to help\nthe anxious ones in this column but\nsas regrets that ah* is unable to\nenter into any further correspond-en ce. \"Of o our seI like my chicken\nyoung, plump and tender, but this\none lays eggs.\"\nREPLT: This is only natural and\nthere is no cause for anxiety.

One young lady states,\n\"I'm worried about Jim. You'll\nnever guess what ha's been doing, I suppose it's just what other boys do\nbut then I haven't really met all that\nmany you see, that is since I met Jim,\nHe's ever so nice really, not as what\nyou'd call handsome or anything like\nthat but Just so attractive, you know\nwhat I mean.

You see it's like this, at first it was ever so\nsoft, but now it almost wakes the\nneighbours, because Jim who hardly\n\u2022war raises his voice, keeps culling\nout in his sleep. Not that I mean ha\nswears, Jim's quite curt eo us is his\nown way. Oh no, he shouts out this\nwoman's name, I know what you're\nthinking, but it's not that, I know\nbecause he's for ever tailing me I'm the only woman in his life. But I do feel there must be some kind of\nexplanation, don't you.\nREPLT: Tea ay dear, I do so agree\nwith you. As you might have found,\nass o an be so difficult i a their actions and thoughts. Some of the\nthings they do are quite in ox plain able in our minds, and often lead to much\nheartburn and anxiety. This is mainly due to their large interest in their\nown person, and their failure to take\na small interest in other people. I am afraid, though that beyond this, I am unable to give you an explanation\nabout your situation because, ay dear\nyou have omitted to tell as the wa\u00ab.\naan's nam*.\n\n"

Then you will\nfind there are a few extras like Ski S School \" That was the Travel Agent.\nThe next day I discovered we had a Ski\nClub of our own. The Imperial College\nSki Club conducted a tour and I was\nwelcome. It catered for beginners, and\ntrained then to be experts. Sounded good.\nCheap too. An all inclusive price of \u00a331\nwith a few extras like .... Kitzbuhel\nwas the queen of the Austrian resorts,\nwe were told.\nThe day arrived, Dec 21st., We\nplayed bridge on the train to Dover,\nwere sea-sick on the boat, and the* made\nourselves as comfort able\"'as possible'an\nthe bunks of the continental train. The\nnext afternoon we arrived. I stepped off\nthe train and promptly eat down. \"Hey,\nyou're not allowed to ski here\" someone\nyelled.\nHaving hired our equipment after a good meal, we set off \"home\". It was a pension half a mile out of town. \"Mot\nas bad as last year\" said one of the\nsenior members. Carrying- the skis\nwas a nuisance. They refused to stay\ntogether, and dug holes in your shoulder.\nPutting them on was even worse. The\ninstructor showed us how, but after putting on one, the other slid forward\nabout 4 feet, just out of reach. Gingerly I stood up, put one foot forward\nand slipped. \"Don'ts it down\" shouted\nthe instructor. Sit down, HaHa...i The\nski was still out of reach.\nIn the afternoon we went up the\nslope, stepping sideways to keep the skis\nparallel to the contour. Then we came\nw his zing down, all three feet of it. We\nhad at last learned how to ski. After\nschool we went up the small lift. After\nall, little kids of four and five were\ncoming down. We got to the top and look\ned down. The slope was axles long. And\nsteep. We put the skis on our damaged\nshoulders and walked dean.\nAfter a week we were experts. We\nwere going up' and down the lifts like\njeter eni,, In fact if we weren't perpetually covered in anew, no <ne would have\nnot i oed the difference. There ware still frequent calls of \"Don'ts it down\" but\nwe hardly noticed. The snow was soft,\nand falling was almost a Godsend. It\nmeant three seconds of rest.\nThen it happened. The greatest\ncurse of them all. It was tragedy in the\naid dle of the Austrian winter. It rain-ed. Overnight the show froze. The oen\noen tres of gravity were sore. Even the\nsoft dunlop ill o of the dive could not\nconsole them.\nThe day we left it fe a snowing. Great\nchunks of it. Never mind l Maybe it will still be there next year,\nFrom S.K. Praaanik, Captain, Ski Club.\nSWIMMING\nLast Friday, I.C. entertained\nOxford Dolphins, and after a close\nmatch, I.C. won 37-27, winning the\nfinal two relays. In an exalting\npolo eaten afterward*, I.C. ware held\nto a55 draw.\nIn the swimming, I.C. ware well\nserved by their University trio of\nHarford, Loveaan, and Shorey, who won\nan event apiece, but their record\nstrives ware unfortunately not Salt*\nas good as Oxford's and so despite\nindividual wins by the above three,\nI.C. were only leading by 2 points\nwhen the final two relays came to be\ndecided. Here, however, contrary to\nexpectations, the superior fitness of\nthe I.C. team showed itself, and they\ntook both relays to win the match com-fort ably. In the polo I. C.,af tea being 3 goals in the rear at one\nstage, were fortunate to pull up, and\ndraw 5-5. Basham, was I.C.'s best\nplayer, scoring a fine hat-trick.\nIn the U.X. League the night before\nI.C. put up a pathetic display and were\ndefeated by Kings by 7-2. This defeat\npractically ruined I.C.'s chance* of\nwinning the League. However the\nseo on d team had an easy 2-0 victory over\nNorthern Polytechnic and are grisly\nestablished in2 nd place in this div-is ion. The third tea a are also playing well, and at present have a clear\nlead at the top of Div. IV.\nSOCCER\nOn Saturday week the 1 st tea a ease Its annual trip to Brighton and,\nfar the first time, managed to show\nits supremacy over Varndean G.S. with\na41 win. Last Saturday at Barlington the 1st XI were very unlucky not\nto beat top of the League Westminster,\nbut o a a e away with a point in a22 draw. The goals were scared by centre\nforward Coups who has 27 to his name\nthis season, but the honours in this\nmato h go to all the tes a members who\ngave such a fine and spirited display.\nThe League record so far:-P. W.D.L. G.F. G.A. Pte.\n8 3 2 3 25 27 8\nThe 2nd and 3rd XI'\u2022 playing very\nwell on Saturday week beat N.E.C and\nL.S. TS. II 6-0 and 9-2, respectively,\nbut the 3rd H could not hold a strong\nBattersea team last Saturday and went\nunder 2-0. On the same day, the\n4th XI beat Institute of Education \u00a3-3\nand the 5th XI beat Chelsea II la a very close game.\n\"SUPPORT REQUIRED\"\nOn Saturday. February 21 at the\nCollege is playing Kings (the holders\nfor the past 3 seasons) in the final\nof the U.L. Cup at Motspur Park.\nCoaches will be leaving College at\n1p.a. on this occasion and further\ndetails o an be found on the Union\nNotice Board. Also stand tickets\ncan be obtained from Club officials\nfor a very small fee.\nCROSS COUNTS*. The past fortnight has been a fairly successful time for the Cross\nCountry Club. Our first team has\nfinished second in two tough races while\nthe seo on dte a a has won three Batches,\none of them by a huge margin.\nOn January 31st the first team\nwere running at Hayes against Metropolitan Police and a United Hospitals\nteam. The Hospitals proved too strong\nfor us, but we easily defeated the\nPolice, the scores being Hospitals\n43 points, I.C.67 points, Police 135\npoints. The first I.C. runner was\nJaeger in 3rd place, then came\nBernard (5), Brown (8), Gilbert (10),\nClifton (11) and Barber (13)\".\nThe following Saturday the first\nteam were at Hempstead for the big\n\u2022Hampstead Match\" against 10 other\nteams. The result was an easy win\nfor Oxford Tortoises (40 points) but\nI.C. took second place with 128 points,\nbeating Southampton, Nottingham, Bristol\nLeicester, and all the London Colleges.\nJohn Collins ran extremely well to\nfinish second, then came Larkum (13)\u00bb\nBriggs (19), Jaeger (24), Brown (25),\nand Clifton (45). The return to\nfitness of Dave Briggs is very welcome.\nOn January 28th our second team\nwent to Brentwood School, and just\nmanaged to win by 38 points,to 42.\nIt is probable that the winning margin would have been greater had not two\nof our runners gone off o our se. The\nrace was won by M\". Barber, who is just\nstarting racing again after an injury.\nA regrettable result of this race was\nthat Paul Anton sustained an injury\nwhich may prevent him racing for the\nrest of the season.\nThe following Wednesday our seo on d team defeated Bancroft's School, Mike\nBarber and Roger Landbeck took 1st and 3rd places respectively. The conditions on this course were atrocious;\nthere was deep mud, frozen hard, yet\ngreasy sad slippery on Mi top.\nLast Saturday the second team\nhad its biggest win of the season, when\nPearl Assurance were defeated by 12\npoints to 33. We had 8 men, Pearl had\n4\u00bb and their 4 men occupied positions\n3, 8, 10 and 12.

Evans,\nB. W.E. Avient, P.M. Ode 11, H.R. Espig and\nR. Lloyd.\nThe programme was extremely ambitious and all three teams were known to\nbe strong, but it was considered justified since the team waa unbeaten daring-the Christmas Term.\nIn fact all three matches were\nlost to superior opposition, including\nseveral county standard players.\nOutstanding performances were those\nof Odell who won in both Belfast and\nDublin, and Evans who lost nar xo tty to\nthe Ulster No.2 in Belfast.\nThe tour was a great suo o ess socially and a particularly pleasant\nevening was spent in Belfast, the Capt.\nperforming an amazing feat of pre sti digit ation before a large student audie no e and the Secretary H\"E a collection\n\"for the clown*.\nThe pilgrimage to the country of\nthe Guinness and the \"Lord Stiff\" waa\nalso greatly enjoyed by all and on the\nevening after the last match the two\nteams managed to consume over seven\ngallons in two hours before the last\nmad rush for the boat train to Holyhead.\nThe experience gained on the tour\nhas since proved invaluable, and the\n1st.v\" remains unbeaten against London\naides and also against Oxford and Cambridge. The closest matches so far this\nterm have been gains ta strong Middlesex Hospital side and Kabie Co_lege, Oxford, who included an Oxford 2nd. team\nplayer.

Our impressions were\na orne, for never extended Imperial\nwon by 51 points - 34 points. One of\nlast year'ao lose st league games was\nagainst the London School of Eoomomios.\nThe return was not as good, although\nParker celebrated his return to the\nteam with a cultured 15 points.\nSo far this season the battle for\nleading points scorer has developed into\na personal duel between the CaptainJ. Fryer and the Coach - M. Barron.\n(Both totals being around the 200\nmark). Although newcomers to the first\nteam'D. Parker and D. Wiekenden have\nsettled in well, and A.
