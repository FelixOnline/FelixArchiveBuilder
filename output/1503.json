The response from\nmost people, in order of frequency, would\nprobably be a blank look, \u201cis that something to\ndo with the Jews?\u201d, or one of intense gushing\nadoration.\nIn a way, they\u2019ve had quite a bit of a struggle as five young men churning out indie-pop\namongst a sea of countless others doing exactly\nthe same. They were dismissed by many at first\nas just another hipster band that would no doubt\nfade away soon enough, and have had a lot to\nprove.\nWith a much anticipated third album on the\nway, it seems they finally have managed to make\ntheir mark on the British music scene.\nIndeed, their early releases of jangly guitar pop\nabout first loves, nans, and a local swimming\npool did not have a depth of meaning which was\nimmediately apparent; except maybe to adolescents who could relate to the emotions behind\nthe songs and old fogies who weren\u2019t old fogy\nenough to have forgotten such wistful memories.\nThe development of those teenage fans into\nyoung adults between their first two albums\nseemed akin to the whole attitude of the band.\nTheir growth and refinement between releases\nhas certainly not been demonstrated to such an\nThe return of The Maccabees\nSnowflakes, dandruff or... cocaine?

Enough to fill your\nears a million times over for the rest of your days.\nAs a single intrepid soul, you can\u2019t possibly listen to\nenough music to filter the bad from the good. Music\nwebsites/blogs/magazines do most of the work for\nyou; just as I\u2019m hopefully doing in this column every\nweek. But even then, you need to be terminally unemployed to keep up with all the music that a site\nlike Pitchfork sends at you.\nUltimately you\u2019re most likely to find an album you\nlove the new-fashioned way: a friend posting music\non your Facebook wall.

    "content": "SCIENCE\nIn brief\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nL\nast Friday night, I was sat in my\nfavourite bar in London with\nmy friends, when a well-dressed\nyoung man in a suit came up to\nme and offered to buy me a cock-tail. Pretty exciting, for a single girl, right?\nWhat this guy was subconsciously signalling to me was that he had money (at least\nenough for his appearance and a cocktail),\nand therefore probably also had good health\nand relatively good genes.\nWe\u2019re all probably quite familiar with the\ntheories behind courtship and mating rituals\nin the animal kingdom \u2013 why the peacock\nhas such a beautiful tail, or why male cranes\ndance in front of females. This is the male\u2019s\nway of saying to the lucky ladies \u201cLook at\nme! I\u2019m healthy and disease-free, I\u2019ve got\ngreat genes, so let\u2019s make babies!\u201d\nThese examples of courtship are about sexual selection before mating, before any form\nof copulation or insemination has taken place.\nBut what people don\u2019t know is that, for some\nspecies, a lot of sexual selection can take\nplace after the deed is done.\nDomestic fowl, for example, are a promiscuous species, where most males get the opportunity to mate with most females, if they\nwant to. Male fowl have developed some\npretty sophisticated strategies for making sure\nthat their sperm has the best chance of winning compared to their mates\u2019 sperm. Sperm\nis a costly thing to make, so our males want to\ngive themselves the best chance of insemina-tion, with the smallest possible cost \u2013 the best\nchance of winning the \u2018sperm competition\u2019.\nResearchers from the University of Sheffield found that dominant males increased the\namount of sperm they ejaculated when mating with a female depending on how many\npartners she\u2019d already had. If he was her first\npartner, he ejaculated the least\u2026 no worries\nthere. If she\u2019d had one previous partner, he\nproduced more, and if she\u2019d had three, he produced more still.\nWhat was interesting was that subordinate\nmales had a slightly different strategy. They\nincreased their sperm investment up until\nthe female had had one previous partner\u2026if\nshe\u2019d had more, they let it go, and their sperm\ninvestment fell away. After all, if you\u2019re a\nsubordinate male, you\u2019re not so likely to get\nanywhere if your girl\u2019s had a few, more dominant partners earlier in the day.\nNot only did males change their sperm\ninvestment based on the female\u2019s promis-cuity, but also depending on how attractive\nthey found her. In fowl world, a female with\na large, red comb on her head is a massive\nturn on. Males produced a far higher sperm\ninvestment when mating with a large-combed\nfemale than when mating with small-combed\nfemale, as well as giving the poor small-combed girls far less action.\nMales also produced the highest amount\nof sperm the first time they mated with a\nparticular female. After the first time, the\nsperm investment steadily decreased. Sort of\nHave sex, then select\nMaya Kaushik on selection after copulation and \u2018cryptic female choice\u2019\na \u2018been there, done that\u2019 attitude \u2013 the first\ntime is probably the most important in terms\nof your chance of successful fertilisation.\nAfter that, well, the novelty appears to wear\noff somewhat.\nSo far we\u2019ve talked as if the guys have all\nthe control. But there\u2019s more at play here. It\nturns out that female fowl can use their reproductive tract to control, to some extent, the\nsperm that has the best chance of fertilisation.\nFemale fowl were shown to expel some ejaculates immediately after insemination, and the\nprobability of this sperm ejection went up as\nthe social status of the male went down. Of\ncourse, it makes more sense for the female to\navoid mating with low social status males at\nall, but unfortunately if you\u2019re a female chick-en, you don\u2019t always have that much choice.\nThe selection by females that takes place after\ninsemination is called \u2018cryptic female choice\u2019\n\u2013 cryptic, because this choice is hidden in the\nfemale reproductive tract, and can\u2019t be easily\nseen or measured.\nSperm competition and cryptic female\nchoice aren\u2019t limited to fowl. There are\nplenty of studies showing these occurrences\nin a wide range of species\u2026dung flies, fruit\nflies, sheep, and comb jellies, to name a few.\nFar less studied and harder to measure than\nthe more obvious behavioural mating strate-gies, the sexual selection that occurs post-insemination may have had a far greater\nimpact on the evolution of species than was\noriginally thought.\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nChickens had the opportunity to get up to a little fowl play during Green Week\nFollow the latest science news\nfrom Imperial and more on our\nFacebook page:\nfacebook.com/FelixScience\nLike us on Facebook\nConfused by DOIs?\nDOI stands for digitial object identifier.

In A Walk On Part: The Fall\nof New Labour, he gets called, \u201ca morally\nand intellectually deficient serial killer\u201d,\nand that\u2019s before he fucked the world \u2013\ndammit, I really must start spelling \u201ctook\noffice\u201d properly\u2026\nA Walk On Part is the stage-adaptation of\nex-Labour MP Chris Mullin\u2019s political dia-ries. It follows his time as a minor player in\nthe New Labour circus, from his re-election\nto Sunderland South in 1997, up to resigning his seat before the 2010 \u201cbigoted woman\u201d general elections. It is a comic treat,\nserving up witty one-liners, sweetly sharp\nsatire, and delicious impersonations of the\nfull array of New Labour buffoons \u2013 inevitably Gordon Brown\u2019s lower jaw conjures\nthe biggest laughs.\nDespite the high-minded content that it\ndeals with, it is a very human play. John\nHodgkinson does a fantastic job delivering a portrait of Chris Mullin: a politician\nwho is sensitive, principled, ambitious, and\nultimately frustrated by his inability to effect real change. Ultimately Chris Mullin is\nabout as likeable a politician as one could\nencounter (he was ridiculed during the expenses scandal because, although was one\nof the lowest claimaints, he claimed back\nmoney for a tv license \u2013 for a black & white\nscreen TV\u2026) But at its core, for me at\nleast, the play forces us to remember how\nthoroughly rotten a world you and I \u201889ers\u2019\ngrew up in (someone\u2019s got to come up with\na name; why not me?) I laughed heartily at\nthe jokes \u2013 Geoff Hoon talking about \u201castonishingly accurate bombing\u201d is delightfully skewered \u2013 but it was a sad laugh. The\nkind of laugh that only arises when there\u2019s\nnaught to do but laugh, for to take it seriously would make you cry in despair.\nI could write all day; to properly review\nthis play would be to consider the whole\nmorally pathetic 13 years of New Labour\ngovernment. But that would probably kill\nme and bore you. The play is intelligent and\nit is funny; it\u2019s human and it\u2019s emotional;\nit\u2019s almost certainly a great evening out\nwith a friend. All of this means that you\ncan truly consider what it is saying without\nbeing distracted by awful acting or terrible\nwriting.\nThe only gripe that I would have with A\nWalk on Part lies with its treatment of Tony\nBlair. Hywel Morgan captures his mannerisms and style masterfully. He conveys\nBlair\u2019s over-earnest faux-sincerity with\ngreat skill. But Blair is never ridiculed di-rectly; he\u2019s a boyish rogue, a figure that we\nare never invited to take seriously. Worse\nstill, at the very end, Chris Mullin concludes that Blair was only ever led astray\nby Bush, that naivet\u00e9 was his only crime.\n(For Christ\u2019s sake, the Tories seem to get\nblamed for Iraq more than Blair). A Walk\non Part is certainly a hilarious and smart indictment of our politics and, of course, New\nLabour. But it seems to conclude that it was\nnot Blair\u2019s fault; that none of the lying, the\nsleaze and the murder carried out in our\nname was Blair\u2019s fault; and that is simply\nnot good enough.\nA Walk on Part: The Fall of New Labour continues at the Soho Theatre until December 10\nDevil May Blair\nThe memoirs of Chris Mullin MP are brought to the stage to give a revealing\naccount of the goings-on behind the scenes during the Blair years\nKadhim Shubber\n\u201c(Bush) gets called \u2018a\nmorally and intellectually\ndeficient serial killer\u2019\u201d\nFELIX\n20 Friday 25 november 2011\nThe judges weren\u2019t impressed by Matt\u2019s offering for the village talent show\n\u201cThe play is intelligent\nand funny; it\u2019s human and\nit\u2019s emotional; it\u2019s almost\ncertainly a great evening\nout with a friend\u201d\nThe Poet\u2019s Column\nFOIL\nby Osas Omoigiade\nI suppose it was my choice to come here\u2026\nSo,\nOktoberfest?\nNah, gotta practice psychometric test\nFinal year project assigned\nSome one or the other engineering design\nMovember?\nDon\u2019t you rememberI\u2019ve got an interview this week\nCan\u2019t afford one misteek!\nThank you for your application\u2026\nFinance is a complication\nLiterature review issued\nChange of Career; Science pursued\nDecember \u202625th ?\nChristmas?

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX 11\nFriday 25 NOVEMBER 2011\nScientists at Imperial College London\nhave presented a theorem which suggests that the wavefunction is a physical object. The paper, which emphasises\nthat the quantum state cannot be interpreted statistically, was submitted on\nNovember 14 and has potential to shake\nthe foundations of quantum theory.\nWavefunctions are a means of describing the quantum state of particles\nin quantum mechanics and are given in\nvalues which lie in the complex plane.\nBeing functions of space and time, they\ncorrespond to the probability density of\nfinding a particle in a given place at a\ngiven time after measuring its position.\nQuantum wavefunctions are affected\nby the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which describes how the quantum state of a system changes in time. The wavefunction\nis the most complete description possible for a physical system, and solutions\nto Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation describe not\nonly systems at the subatomic level, but\nalso atomic, molecular, and other macroscopic systems, potentially the entire\nuniverse.\nThe paper, submitted by a trio of Imperial physicists led by Matthew Pusey,\nreasons that if a quantum wavefunction\nwere purely a statistical tool, then quantum states that are unconnected across\nspace and time would be able to communicate with each other. Since this appears to be very unlikely, the researchers conclude the wavefunction must\nbe physically real. The paper has been\nmet with scepticism online, with comments questioning the its debunking of\nthe claim that the wavefunction must be\ninterpreted statistically.\nDavid Wallace, a philosopher of physics at the University of Oxford said the\ntheorem is \u201cthe most important result in\nthe foundations of quantum mechanics\u201d\nthat he\u2019s seen in his fifteen year professional career. \u201cThis strips away obscurity\nand shows you can\u2019t have an interpretation of a quantum state as probabilistic\u201d,\nhe continued. If the wavefunction is indeed real, it can no longer be set apart\nfrom other physical quantities such as\nmomentum and velocity.\nAntony Valentini, a theoretical physicist at Clemson University, believes the\nresult may be the most important general\ntheorem regarding quantum mechanics\nsince Bell\u2019s theorem which proved that\nif quantum mechanics describes real en-tities, it must include the idea of entanglement between unconnected particles.\nThe researchers liken their theorem to\nthe notion that a coin being flipped in a\nbiased way has the physical property of\nbeing biased rather than it being a statistical property of the coin flipping events.\nThe wavefunction has been interpreted\nas a statistical tool for 85 years, and the\ntheorem appears to reopen the question\nof what the wavefunction represents.\nAlexander Karapetian\nWavefunction may be real after all\nWorld\u2019s lightest material made\nThe lightest material to date has been\ncreated; weighing in at less than 10\nmilligrams per cubic centimetre, it is\nlighter than aerogels and dense foams.\nThe Guinness world record beater has\na density of just 0.9 milligrams per cubic centimetre, in perspective this is\n100 times lighter than Styrofoam. The\nresearch was conducted by scientists\nfrom the University of California, Irvine, HRL Laboratories and the California Institute of Technology; it was\nfunded by the American Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.\nIt is comprised of periodic hollow-tubes, which are 1000 times thinner\nthan a human hair. Despite having a\nlow density, the micro lattice has a high\nstrength due to the unity of many layers of periodic hollow-tubes. In con-trast, aerogels although ultralight, lack\nstrength due to their random structure.\nAnother attribute is super elastic-ity; it has a tolerance to local strains\nthrough the formation of relief cracks.\nFurthermore, upon being compressed\nby a load of even 50 per cent, it can recover almost completely; a demonstration of its potential use as an acoustic,\nenergy or vibration absorber.\nScientists carefully considered each\naspect of design, for instance node geometry and cell symmetry. Through\nprecisely controlling such architectural elements of materials, researchers\nare pushing the field of Nano-materials design forward. For instance, as\npointed out by Dr Bill Carter of HRL\nlaboratories, scientists have applied\nthe design principles of modern build-ings, such as the Eiffel tower, which\nare light and weight-efficient due to\ntheir architecture, to the material\u2019s\ncreation.\nThrough combining the properties of\nstrength, low density, super elasticity\nand energy absorption, a truly remarkable material has been created. There\nare a wide range of potential applica-tions, from thermal insulation to next\ngeneration batteries.\nDOI: 10.1126/science.1211649\nJula Humphries\nI wish my student loan was this light\n40 years ago, physicists Hendrik Casimir\nand Dirk Polder, proposed that empty\nspace wasn\u2019t really empty. This may\nseem counterintuitive, but the answer\nlies in quantum mechanics. Quantum\nmechanics tells us is that a vacuum cannot have zero energy. It is actually a\nsea of virtual particles, usually photons,\nwhich exist for infinitesimal amounts of\ntime and cannot be observed on the scale\nat which we live.\nWe may not be able to see these parti-cles, but we can see their effects. Casimir\nand Polder\u2019s theory postulated that if you\nplace two metal plates a small distance\napart, so that more particles exist on the\noutside of the plates than within, the\noverall effect would be a net attractive\nforce, pulling the plates together. The\nforce would only be noticeable when the\nplates have velocities comparable to the\nspeed of light and is therefore difficult to\nprove. Though theoretical, the Casimir\nEffect has since been used to explain attraction of nanoscale electrical compo-nents.\nNow, researchers have gone one step\nfurther. Chris Wilson from Chalmers\nUniversity of Technology in Gothenburg,\nSweden, and his colleagues were able to\npull photons out of the vacuum in a process called the dynamical Casimir effect.\nWilson says: \u201cIt was a difficult technical\nexperiment. We were very happy when\nit worked.\u201d\nThe researchers used a superconducting electrical circuit and oscillator that\nrapidly alters the distance an electron\nmust travel through the circuit. The electron\u2019s movement is determined by the location at which the circuit\u2019s electric field\nfalls to zero. The team used a superconducting quantum interference device to\ncontrol the circuit\u2019s characteristics.\nThe dynamics of the electron were altered and the team was able to change\nthe distance from the electron to the ze-ro-field location so quickly that the electron appeared to move at a quarter of the\nspeed of light. This seemed to give the\nelectron enough energy to transfer to the\nvirtual photon, allowing it to become real\nand be emitted by the circuit. \u201cParticles\nwere produced in pairs, coming right out\nof the vacuum,\u201d Wilson says.\nG\u00f6ran Johansson, Associate Professor\nof Theoretical Physics, explains: \u201cRelatively little energy is therefore required\nin order to excite them out of their virtual\nstate. In principle, one could also create\nother particles from vacuum, such as\nelectrons or protons, but that would require a lot more energy.\u201d Another interesting effect is that the photons materialise is pairs, and research into explaining\nwhy is still ongoing.\nThe significance of this breakthrough\nis sure to soon become apparent.\nParticles\nfrom thin air\nPavitar Devgon\nThe interpretation of the wavefunction has been static for 85 years\n\n"

Today:\nSynchronised Swimming! Yep, I know\nyou\u2019re excited about this one. I meet up\nwith Carla, the treasurer, Delphine, the\nclub secretary and Zara, the club president in 568 to talk swimming pools,\nholding your breath underwater, and\nfancy routines. Owing to the triple interview format, this week is presented as a\nQ&A session. Enjoy!\nFelix Sport: So, to start off with, a\ncouple of questions for you guys: how\ndid you get into synchronised swim-ming? Did you do it before university?\nZara Ganase: I sort of got interested\nwhen I went to the US during the summer of 2008, and saw the blanket media\ncoverage of the American Olympic team\n\u2013 including synchronised swimming. I\nthought it would be a cool thing to try,\nand found out that there was a club at\nImperial\u2026and here I am, three years\nlater: Club President!\nCarla Canturri-Gispert: I\u2019ve always\nloved the water, but not competitive\nswimming which I find boring. Synchronised swimming seemed like a lot\nof fun, even though I had never done it\nbefore uni, and I signed up when I came\nto Imperial.\nDelphine Rolando: I have actually\nbeen doing this since I was 11! I picked\nit up in France as a kid, but had a long\nbreak during my studies and didn\u2019t do\nany for five years. I picked it up again\nhere, though, and am enjoying it as\nmuch as ever.\nFS: Okay, so two out of three committee members were complete beginners before coming to Imperial. How\nmany members do you have? What\nproportion of that is made up of be-ginners?\nDR: This year we had about ten people sign up at freshers\u2019 fair, and we\u2019re\nalmost hitting thirty members\u2026\nCC-G: Although one thing to know is\nthat the club only started four years ago.\nFS: So you\u2019re growing slowly but\nsurely then?\nZG: I think that\u2019s kind of the objec-tive. We\u2019ve sort of got three level groups:\nthe absolute beginners, the intermediate\npeople such as Carla or myself who have\ndone it for a couple of years, and then\nthere is a group of swimmers who had\nstarted synchronised swimming before\nuniversity and want to continue, such as\nDelphine.\nFS: How does the competition structure work? I mean, do you have tournaments or things like that with other\nuniversities?\nDR: Actually, when Carla said we\nformed four years ago she forgot to\nmention that we\u2019re pretty much the\nonly university synchronised swimming\nclub in the country. It really isn\u2019t a big\nthing here, and there is no such thing as\na BUCS tournament or the equivalent\nfor us. Having said that, we are trying to\nenter a team into the French university\nchampionships, to be able to compete in\nsomething!\nCC-G: Even that competition is relatively new, it didn\u2019t exist two years ago.\nFS: What does a typical training\nsession consist of? Do you practice a\nparticular routine?\nCC-G: It\u2019s generally 45 minutes of\nwarmups and stretching outside the\npool, followed by an hour and a quarter\nof practicing the different figures, lifts\nand positions you can do in the pool.\nDR: We have one main coach and two\nassistant coaches, all of whom used to\nrepresent their countries at an international level. Our main coach Eug\u00e9nie\nis especially good at teaching beginners\nthe basics!\nZG: We actually have two sessions a\nweek, on Mondays at Ethos and Thursdays at St. Mary\u2019s. We want to get as\nmany people as possible to come along,\nso if you\u2019re interested, don\u2019t hesitate!\nFS: A question about the sport itself,\nbecause I don\u2019t think that many people are familiar with it: what does a\nteam consist of in synchronised swim-ming?\nDR: A routine is usually done by eight\nswimmers, all performing the same\nthing, and can last up to about five min-utes. In the Olympics, it is an all-female\nsport but outside of that more and more\nguys are taking it up, and competitions\nallow for mixed teams! We really want\nto get more guys in as this gives you\nmore possibilities for lifts and other\nthings during a routine, because guys\njust have more strength.\nFS: What are the skills you need to\nbe good at synchro? Is it easy to progress quickly if you start from scratch?\nCC-G: It isn\u2019t too hard to learn the different moves and techniques involved in\nsynchronised swimming, you can pick\nthose up in a couple of weeks. However\nyou do need a level of fitness and muscle strength to pull these off, and that\u2019s\nwhere it takes a lot of work.\nDR: You need flexibility, core strength\nand you have to learn to hold your breath\nfor long periods of time \u2013 these aren\u2019t\nthings that come overnight. Having said\nthat I still think synchro is a very accessible sport, and can be a lot of fun!\nFancy giving it a go?\nemail syncswimming@ic.ac.uk for info!\nCaptains\u2019 Interviews:\nSynchronised Swimming\nZara Ganase, Club President\nChemical Engineering PhD\n2 years\u2019 experience\nEssential info:\nDelphine Rolando, Club Secretary\nSystems Biology PhD\n7 years\u2019 experience\nCarla Canturri-Gispert, Club Treasurer\nAeronautical Engineering PhD\n2 years\u2019 experience\nLike: being able to breathe during a lift Dislike: the lack of guys in Synchro\n1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 8\n9\n9 10 11 10\n11 12 13\n14\n13 15 14 15 16\n17\n17 19 18 19 21\n22\n20 21 24 22 23\n25\n24 25 27\n26 29\n12 15\n16 17 18 19 20\n21\n22 23 24 25\n26\n20\n26\n28\n23\n18\n16\n15\n\n"

In Italy, people\ncelebrated in the streets\nas Berlusconi resigned;\nacross Europe, markets\nsighed in relief and hoped that his successor would be able to unscrew the\npooch that he so thoroughly enjoyed\nscrewing. The \u2018it has to get worse before it can get better\u2019 part of this financial crisis seemed to be behind us, and\nItaly could get back on the road to nor-malcy. Times, finally, are looking up.\nIt\u2019s easy to forget why we got here,\nwhy Berlusconi was allowed in the\ncontrol room for so long. There is very\nlittle doubt that he was a terrible leader\nand a pretty reproachable human being\nto boot. So how could this man have\nbeen allowed such a heavy influence in\nthe politics of the eighth largest economy in the world for close to twenty\nyears? Simply put, he was elected. On\nthree separate occasions, the majority of voters looked at this man and\nthought that, yes, that was the guy they\nwanted to run their country.\nArguably, Berlusconi is amongst the\ngreatest failures that democracy has\never produced, rivalled only by the\nstint by a terrorist organisation in Palestine (and that time which cannot be\nmentioned without invoking Godwin\u2019s\nLaw). He\u2019s living proof that you don\u2019t\nneed sparkling ideas to convince a nation that you should lead them; a charismatic demeanour and a truckload of\nmoney to spare will suffice. He was\nhailed as a media genius, as someone\nRhys Davies\nPietro Aronica\nAll aboard the nostalgia train\nThe dark side of democracy\nwho spoke to the common man and\nhandled information in a modern way.\nHe was given far too much credit. Berlusconi simply managed to play the\nsystem.\nOf course he looks like a media ge-nius: he directly controlled three of\nthe six main channels of Italian television (which exist only to propagate his\nmessage), alongside some of the most\ninfluential newspapers and magazines\nof the country. His stranglehold was\nalmost total, and he made sure that it\nwas only his views which got across\nto the general populace. He named his\nfirst party \u201cHooray for Italy!\u201d, which\nis about as uncultured as it gets, and he\nwon on the back of the \u201crevolutionary\u201d\nslogan \u201cLess Taxes For Everybody\u201d\n\u2013 second only to \u201cMore Money For\nEverybody\u201d in the ranking of inanely\npopulist catchphrases.\nBerlusconi has always been portrayed as an anomaly. An outlier, a\nfreak occurrence. But the truth is that\ndemocracy will always be prone to\nthese sorts of hiccups. On paper, democracy ensures that the best course\nof action is undertaken, because the\npeople, who bear the consequences\nof those actions, get to choose; in\npractice, people are a cowardly and\nsuperstitious lot who rarely bother to\nresearch or care about the election.\nElections, as Berlusconi showed, can\nbecome little more than popularity\ncontests, with candidates winning simply because they have the tightest grip\non the information channels, and are\nT\nhere are many ways to\ntravel and I like to think\nthat I\u2019ve experienced\nmost of them. Each one\nhas its own charm, best\nsuited to different needs and situa-tions; from the humdrum of buses to\nthe out-of-this-world splendour of\nairplanes, and, for the adventurous\namong you, the awesome majesty of\nriding an ostrich to college. But there\nis one form that will hold a special\nplace in my heart.\nLittle boys and train sets go hand\nin hand. Little boxes with wheels on\nthe bottom are suddenly transformed\nby the magic of the imagination into\nthe Flying Scotsman. Most boys outgrow this tryst, moving on to Action\nMan or football or girls, or whatever,\nbut I never did. In the most impressionable corner of my mind, trains\nwill always be associated with magic\nand wonder. Basically, I think they\u2019re\npretty cool.\nNow that I\u2019m (for want of a better word) grown-up, the games have\nchanged but the love affair goes on.\nI remember first coming to London\nand arriving at Paddington Station.\nMy jaw dropped as I took in the cathedral of steel and steam, built by its\nprophet Brunel. The trains were modern models by First Great Western\nbut it was not too hard to paint over\nthe grubby diesel engines with shining brass pistons. I wept.\nI have travelled from Paddington\nmany times since, and from other\ngrand stations, but the journey is\nnever dull. The best form of cardio, I\nhave found, is pelting down the plat-form, trying to catch the train before\nit leaves. Once, when I had a suitcase full of library books in tow, it\nwas just as good for weight training\nas well.\nAnd once aboard the train, I am\nsubmerged in a most divine melting\npot. Surrounded by strangers from all\nwalks of life, I must sit and interact\nwith people I would not normally mix\nwith. No man is an island, said John\nDonne. I can only assume he coined\nthis on the 9:17 from Euston. The\ntrain is for everyone and it is where\nwe all meet. Apart from those bastards in first class.\nIt goes further than that. As well as\nmeeting all peoples on the train, we\ncan travel to all times on the train. All\ntimes after 1825, anyway. There are\nsmall village stations out in the middle of nowhere, with tiny red brick\ncottages that have not changed in a\nhundred years. When the train occasionally deigns to stop, the whole\nvillage turns out to see it. But the age\nof trains is not over yet. If we look to\nthe future, and by that I mean Japan,\ntrains shoot across the landscape at\nimpossible speeds, powered by mag-thus able to sway public opinion. It is\nnot political creed or ability to govern\nthat put people in charge, but the ability to control the media.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not advocating for some revolution to destroy\nthe system; I would just like to point\nout that democracy, often seen as the\ngold standard of governments and\nhailed as the solution that, if imple-mented, will singlehandedly lead to\nthe prosperity of a nation, is deeply\nflawed. As with many ideas that are\ngreat in theory, it relies on assumptions\nthat simply aren\u2019t true: in this case,\nthat the general public is a reasoning,\nrational beast which always makes the\nmost intelligent choices for the future.\nDemocracy, as it is evolving, works\nbetter than other systems but is in\nnets, gravity, faster-than-light neutrinos and other tools of science-fiction.\nThis all comes back to the same\ngeneral idea. A train ticket is a ticket\nto adventure, as well as Didcot Parkway. Very rarely have I been bored\nwith a train journey, and even then I\npretended to like it as so not to hurt\nits feelings.\nEven when the trains are gone,\nthe magic lingers. In the woods near\nwhere I live in Cardiff, there is an\nold railway line. The tracks have\nbeen ripped up long ago but it still\nresists the encroachment of nature.\nFor maybe a mile or more, an impossibly straight path leads through the\nforest, occasionally overshadowed by\nbrickwork arches. There is a humble\nserenity about walking in the wake of\nsomething long passed.\nAnd yet, I can\u2019t help looking over\nmy shoulder in case the 17:36 to\nTongwynlais is coming.\nArguably, Berlusconi\nis amongst the\ngreatest failures\nthat democracy has\never produced\n\u201c\nArguab\nArguab\ndanger of falling in disrepair due to\ncomplacency on our part. Serious laws\non conflict of interest and greater emphasis towards technocracy would be\ndesirable in order to avoid a populist\ndrift of the institutions. Most impor-tantly, we need to reconsider the way\nin which we, the public, approach it.\nHolding as the ultimate authority the\nopinion of a population who may or\nmay not be informed on the issue at\nhand and are easily swayed by the media is an idea that deserves very careful\nscrutiny.\nItaly\u2019s latest mistake cost them fifteen years of missed progress and is\nthreatening to collapse the euro; we\nmust acknowledge, and prepare for the\nfact, that vox populi doesn\u2019t equate to\nvox dei.\nLadies, please, stop arguing. There\u2019s enough of me to share with you all\n\u201d\n\u201d\nEven when the\ntrains are gone,\nthe magic lingers\n\u201c\nEven w\nEven w\ntrains\ntrains\n\n"

Silicon\nValley comes to Imperial (SVC2I),\nhosted by Imperial Entrepreneurs\nand the Department of Computing\nin collaboration with MIT Enterprise\nForum, brought a range of speakers to\nour doorstep. They were welcomed by\nan audience of over 120, and a waiting-list of over 150.\nThe first of the keynote speakers was\nthe highly experienced Angad Paul, cofounder and major shareholder of several companies, and currently CEO of the\n$1.5 billion Caparo Group. Soft-spoken\nand with calm confidence, he talked\nabout the challenges of running his large\nbusiness and shared the lessons that he\nhad learned along the way.\nFollowing him was the dynamic Rob\nDeeming of Gilt Groupe, an online shop\noffering luxury brands at discounted\nprices, which is based in the US but expanding into the UK. He spoke of his\nprevious work, both entrepreneurial and\notherwise, and taught the audience that\njoining a young startup is just as rewarding as starting your own, drawing on his\nown experiences helping Gilt Groupe\ngrow from 30 employees to 900. He\nalso entertained with fascinating statistics of rapid growth and critical points\nof website based businesses, outlining\nthe importance of computing in solving\nthese problems and offering these op-portunities.\nThe session one panel discussion\nwas moderated by George Berkowski,\nchairman of MIT Enterprise Forum\nUK, regularly involved in new ventures\nand startups. The panel consisted of\nthe aforementioned keynote speakers,\njoined by Paul Joyce \u2013 founder of GeckSilicon Valley comes to Imperial\noboard.com. Among many interesting\ndiscussions, they spoke of how they became entrepreneurs later in life and explained that going for it at a young age\nis not always the best scenario. Building experience first, even in investment\nbanks as in Paul\u2019s case, is important but\nso is keeping the entrepreneurial vision\nkeen until the right time.\n\u201cThere is no point\nin becoming an\nentrepreneur\nwithout relentless\ndetermination to\nsolve a particular\nproblem\u201d\nFollowing a short tea break, the next\nsession began with Alastair Mitchell,\nfounder and CEO of Huddle, a cloud-based enterprise collaboration tool. He\nspoke of the importance of beautiful\ndesign on top of functionality, even for\nsomething as basic as file sharing inter-faces. Along with this, he talked about\nhaving strong negotiating skills and not\ndoing any favours when sorting out a\ndeal \u2013 even if it is with friends. He also\nhad the name \u2018Huddle\u2019 trademarked and\nbelieved in the power of having a short\ncatch names. It turned out to be a smart\nmove as many companies, including\nGoogle, have tried to use the name.\nMartin Varsavsky, entrepreneurial genius and currently Founder and CEO of\nFon, a crowdsourced WiFi network, was\nthe last keynote speaker of the night. His\nwitty anecdotes and opinionated stories\nentertained one and all, and truly portrayed the passion of a genuine entrepre-neur. He talked of his disgust when not\nbeing able to access WiFi when he felt\nhe \u201cdeserved\u201d it. Through this disgust he\nlaunched Fon. Being his own boss is his\ngreatest motivator for being an entrepre-neur, he explained, and said that there is\nno point in becoming an entrepreneur\nwithout relentless determination to solve\na particular problem.\nThe final section of the event was a\nfabulous panel, with Alastair and Martin, joined by Imperial Joint Maths and\nComputing alumnus Omar Tayeb. He is\nCEO and founder of Blippar, the first in\nmobile advertising using augmented reality and image recognition. The fourth\npanelist was Reshma Sohoni, currently a\nPartner of famous incubator Seedcamp.\nThis time the panel was moderated by\nAnthony Gell, a charismatic entrepreneur and currently Founder of LeadersIn.com, an online forum devoted to\nsharing the wisdom of world leaders.\nHis questions were creative and led to\nmany active discussions, one of which\nbeing the lessons that Steve Jobs will\nleave behind.\n\u2018Silicon Valley comes to Imperial\u2019was\none of the university stops on the larger\n\u2018Silicon Valley comes to the UK\u2019 tour,\nwhich originated in Oxford before moving to Cambridge and beyond.

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX 9\nFriday 25 NOVEMBER 2011\nLast week the IPCC released the executive summary to their special report on\nextreme events and disasters that will be\npublished in full in February next year.\nThe review looked at extreme events in\ntwo ways, first considering how they\nhave changed over the last 50 years and\nthen looking at how models predict they\nwill change in future climate change\nscenarios. The importance of this is to\nunderstand the human and economic\ndamage that could be caused by climate\nchange. The report was welcomed by\nSimon Brown, the Extremes Research\nManager at the Met Office, who told\nthe Guardian, \u201cless emphasis has traditionally been given to these phenomena\nwhich are very likely to be the means\nby which ordinary people experience\nclimate change.\u201d\nBy definition extreme events are rare,\nwhich makes identifying trends chal-lenging, especially for certain types of\nevents and regions for which records of\npast events are poor. With this in mind,\nhowever, the report had high confidence that the number of hot days had\nincreased in the past 50 years and statistical trends in heavy precipitation were\nobserved with confidence in a general\nglobal increase. This highlights how our\nextreme weather events have already\nbeen changing.\nAlthough the simulation of some future extreme events for different emissions over the next few decades did\nnot exceed the natural variation of the\nclimate some extreme events allowed\nthe report to make strong statements.\nThe IPCC are almost certain that both\nextremely warm and cold days will\nincrease in both their severity and frequency on a global scale by the end of\nthe 21st century if greenhouse emissions continue as normal.\nEverywhere but the highest northern\nlatitudes, heat events that currently occur once every two decades will show\nup every couple of years and events that\noccur once every two decade will be\nup to 5\u00baC hotter. As both extreme heat\nand cold kill, even in Western countries\n(the 2003 European heat wave caused\napproximately 35,000 deaths), the increased frequency and magnitude of\nthese events will have lethal effects.\nFurther simulations show that heavy\nrainfall events are likely to occur nearly\nfour times as frequently as they do now\nby the end of the century. Although this\nresult does not translate into changes\nin flooding events due to the dependency of flooding on topography, sub-strate, and development, an increase in\nthe heavy rainfall will be expected to\nLuke Sheldon\nExtreme weather set to increase\nSuicidal corals know what\u2019s coming\nScientists in Australia have conducted research showing that corals\ncan detect when adverse conditions\nthreaten their survival, and can activate a cell death mechanism to save\nthe organism as a whole. This process\nleads to coral bleaching, where corals\nexpel or digest the symbiotic algae\nwhich feed them.\nThe researchers identified a complex cascade of molecular signals\nwhich lead to the self inflicted death\nof cells, known as apoptosis, in corals\nand their associated algae. Apoptosis\nis a process that occurs in many organisms \u2013 including humans, which\nexists to save the organism by eliminating damaged or diseased cells.\nCoral bleaching is currently one of\nthe most significant threats to coral\nreefs worldwide and is triggered by\nrising water temperatures which lead\nto the coral and its algae becoming\nheat stressed. The cell death process\nbegins at temperatures which are 3\ndegrees less than those which normally cause coral bleaching, indicating that corals can anticipate poor\nconditions.\nStrangely, the team from the Arc\ncentre of research for Coral Reef\nStudies and James Cook University\nfound molecular signals both encouraging and discouraging cell death\nwere active at high water tempera-tures. They have therefore proposed\na theory where corals kill off some\ncells in order to strengthen others\nin expectation of staging a recovery once the warm water has moved\naway. This theory would explain how\nsome corals are able to recover after\na bleaching event if it has not been\nextreme.\nLead researcher Dr Tracy Ainsworth suggests that understanding\nthe recovery process of corals will\nbe beneficial to promoting their sur-vival: \u201cUnderstanding the recovery\nprocess for any living organism is\nalways a big help\u201d. Discoveries such\nSamuel Cavenagh\n\u201d\nHeavy rainfall events\nare likely to occur\nnearly four times\nas frequently as\nthey do now by the\nend of the century,\nincreasing flooding\nand landslides\n\u201c\nHeavy ra\nHeavy ra\nlik l\nlik Have you ever wondered how your dog\nknows when your partner is on their way\nhome even if they are miles away? Or\nhow you so often know who is calling before you pick up the phone?\nMost of the three hundred people\n(standing room only!) gathered in South\nKensington on October 18 to hear a lecture organised by the Friends of Imperial\nCollege had experienced one or both of\nthese phenomena. Is it real? Or is it just\nthat we don\u2019t notice, or forget, the many\ntimes these things don\u2019t happen?\nIn his lecture on October 18, scientist\nand author Dr Rupert Sheldrake tabled\nevidence to suggest that these, and other\nstrange coincidences, happen much more\noften than chance alone would suggest.\nCurrent scientific knowledge does not\noffer an explanation. Dr Sheldrake offers the hypothesis that the mind creates\na \u2018field\u2019 which can be sensed by other\nminds and can stretch over long distances.\nHowever, his lecture focused more on the\nevidence he had assembled rather than on\npossible explanations.\nDr Sheldrake is an able speaker and\nclearly knows his subject extremely well.\nHe kept the audience engaged throughout\nhis hour-long lecture and presented his evidence in a compelling way. He handled,\nsometimes doubtful, questions clearly and\nprofessionally.\nIn thanking Dr Sheldrake, Prof Igor\nAleksander commented he was a brave\nman for taking on the scientific estab-lishment. Dr Sheldrake\u2019s findings and\ntheories meet with much scepticism from\nmany people \u2013 both in his field and in the\nbroader scientific community. For some,\nhis work is pseudo-science at best and\nbrings \u2018real\u2019science into disrepute.\nHowever, the feeling of this member of\nthe audience at least was that the Friends\nof Imperial College had performed a service by giving Dr Sheldrake the opportunity to expound his ideas and perhaps\nstimulate the kind of fact-based response\nwhich either allows science to advance, or\ncloses off blind alleys on occasion. It will\nbe interesting to see which in this case!\nThe Friends of Imperial College is dedicated to spreading enthusiasm and knowledge of science, technology and medicine.\nIt is independent of, but linked to, one\nof the premier scientific establishments\non the globe and organises lectures and\nevents to spread knowledge and stimulate\nattention to scientific developments.

After picking up a couple of\nwayward sabreurs the minibus made its\nway up the M40 towards the inhospitable climes of the Oxford cricket school,\nwhere the matches were to be played.\nThe anticipation was tangible; the\nteam are current defending champions of the BUCS competition and had\na reputation to uphold. Unfortunately,\nthe vagaries of graduation and years\nabroad had left them bereft of a couple\nof talented epeeists. The new epee team\nof Harry Gulliver, John Ashcroft and\nChris Gilliam was as yet untested \u2013\nhow would they fare? The foil had seen\nsome changes too, with fresher Glen\nOstacchini making a place for himself\nand Indy Leclercq returning from a year\nabroad to join Ed Collier and Chris.\nSabre remained unchanged, thankfully,\nand the team knew they could count on\ncaptain Didier Nohlmans, Henry Gann\nand Maiyuran Ratneswaran to crush the\nopposing teams.\nIC\u2019s first match was against ULU,\nwho turned out to be a shadow of their\nformer selves. Lacking some key fenc-ers, their second place in the league last\nyear seemed a long way away as first\nthe sabreurs, then the foilists and finally\nthe epeeists came away with comfortable victories. Final score: 135-74 to\nImperial.\nThe fencers knew, however, that the\nreal challenge was yet to come, with\nCambridge, Bristol and Oxford all having turned up with strong teams. Cambridge were next, and having won the\ntoss Imperial determined the order of\nfencing: sabre, foil and epee for last.\nThe sabre ended up being a relatively\nMen\u2019s 1st 135\nULU 1st 74\nMen\u2019s 1st 114\nCambridge 1st 107\nMen\u2019s 1st 101\nBristol 1st 100\nMen\u2019s 1st 98\nOxford 1st 98*\n*Oxford win the match on weapons\n...Continued on Page 45\ncomfortable victory, although lapses\nof concentration towards the end of\nthe match cost them some silly points.\nImperial went into the foil with an almost twenty point lead. Some strong\nopposition from Cambridge, along with\nsome harsh refereeing by one of their\nfencers, meant Imperial lost the foil by\na few points to go into the epee with a\nsixteen-point cushion. This meant that\nthe epeeists had to score at least thirty\npoints for IC to put the match away. Doing their best to hold things up, the boys\nin white nevertheless started dropping\npoints here and there, and at one point\ncame very close to losing the overall\nlead. Coming into the final bout, Harry\nwas but two points ahead overall. He\nproduced a blistering performance to\nhit the magic number of points and even\nwon his match in the process, meaning\nthat Imperial came away with a seven-point victory, 114-107. As the team\nsplit up for the night, the designated BK\nMVP of the day was duly deemed to be\nHarry.\nThe following morning saw a 9am\nstart versus Bristol in the cold cricket\nschool. While there was reason to be\ncautious, as Bristol have always been\na strong team (carried by their star\nfoilist), the consensus was that they\nwere beatable. Foil started the match,\ndoing very well to come out with a slim\ndeficit after the match \u2013 considering the\nstrength of the Bristol foilists). The sa-breurs then did their thing and re-estab-lished a strong lead, Henry in particular\nproducing a strong performance to walk\nall over the Bristol fencers.\nBittersweet\nresults for\nIC Fencing\nMen\u2019s 1st\nWeekend tournament\nculminates in nail-biting loss to\nOxford on a single hit\n\n"

    "content": "FASHION\nMen: How to dress for an interview\nAs the dreaded season of interrogation kicks in, even the most macho of men start to wonder how they can dress\nto impress. Ross Gray shows you what to wear to that all important interview\nSuit The key to successful interview or business\ndress is being conservative without being\nboring, but forget trying to be interesting\nwhen it comes to the suit.\nFor banking, and any client-facing business role, you want a dark \u2013 navy or charcoal \u2013 single breasted suit with a notch lapel\nof medium width (skinny is very fashionable\nat the moment \u2013 avoid this like the plague;\nit will be uncool in half a year).\nSmall or average height men should buy\ntwo button suits, while those on the taller\nside should go for three. Always fasten the\ntop button on a two and the middle button\non a three, unfastening every time you sit\ndown when it comes to the interview itself.\nTry to resist the temptation to shoot down\ntwo birds with one stone and get a black\nsuit as interviewers generally do not appreciate their applicants being dressed for a\nfuneral.\nShirt and Tie This is the one area where you can really\nput your personality into business dress.\nWell, not quite \u2013 if you are interviewing for\ncity positions, forget any shirt that\u2019s not\nblue or white.\nIt\u2019s generally best to go for solid twill or\npoplin cotton as it can provide you with\nmore creativity in the tie area, and under\nno circumstances should you use French\ncuffs; your interviewer will think you have a\nhigh opinion of yourself.\nIf you have gone for a solid shirt and a\nfairly solid suit, make sure you do not also\nwear a solid tie; while you are not going to\nstand out as bad, nobody will remember\nyou for your dress.\nIf wearing a solid shirt go for a dotted\nor striped tie, and try to match colours as\nwell as possible. It\u2019s hard to go wrong with\nred or yellow/navy on pale blue, or any\nshade of blue on white. As a good general\nrule, your tie and shirt should never have\nthe same pattern \u2013 if your shirt is striped,\nget a solid or dotted tie. If the same pattern is to be employed, make sure there\nis a large difference in pattern size, or the\ncombination will be too busy and difficult\non the eye.\nShoes They can be in any colour, as long as it\u2019s\nblack.\nIf you are considering wearing brown shoes\nto an interview, then you really need my guidance and you\u2019d better start paying attention.\nYour shoes should be black, leather, and\npolished \u2013 they should shine, but not to a\nmilitary level. A lack of shine on your shoes\nindicates sloppiness in your appearance,\nand any dust/dirt will make you look like an\noutright slob.\nThe kind of shoes you can go for will vary\nfrom role to role, but always make sure the\ntoes are elegantly rounded, and generally\nit\u2019s a pretty good idea to avoid loafers.\nFor City roles, it is standard to go for a\nclean Oxford or an understated brogue. It\nis worth paying for quality where shoes are\nconcerned, and even if you aren\u2019t shopping at Church\u2019s you should make sure your\nshoes are at least leather soled and fit well.\nAccessories and\nGrooming\nA very simple area for most university students preparing for interview, grooming\nshould probably be weighted heavily at our\nmost grand of institutions.\nBasics that shouldn\u2019t need stating: show-er, shave, cut your nails and keep them\nclean, brush your teeth. Use wax or gel if\nyour hair will appear messy without it but\navoid drowning it \u2013 nothing will make you\nseem less professional than looking like you\nhave just discovered gel. Do not use cologne\nas in a small space like an interview room it\nwill be overpowering and create a negative\nimpression.\nAccessories may seem unimportant but it\nis the little touches that make all the difference in business dress. Always wear a belt\nmatched with the colour of your shoes.\nIf you are going to wear a watch, try not to\nmake too much of a statement \u2013 nobody appreciates a 19-year-old interviewing for an internship trying to be flash. Your watch should\nnever be better than your interviewers\u2019.\nA pocket square (white matches every-thing) can help to complete a look and help\nyour tie patterns to pop, but be careful when\nconsidering other colours; only attempt if\nyou are confident in your matching.\nNEXT WEEK: The Best First Impression \u2013 A girl\u2019s guide to the\nperfect approach to subtle style and formality in interview dressing\n33\nFELIX Friday 25 november 2011\nFashion Editors: Saskia Verhagen\nAlice Yang\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "impacts on the people who they provide\nvital services for. This makes striking\ndifficult for the strikers too, as they find\nthemselves reluctant to see their library\nor school close. However, strikes are\none of the only tools by which workers\ncan try and negotiate the conditions in\nwhich they work every day. By withdrawing their labour, they remind us\nhow important their services are. In this\nbeginner\u2019s guide to striking we shall\nexplain what N30 is about and what is\nhappening. We will also argue that students can and do play an important role\nin strikes, and that it is vital that we take\npart in N30.\nOn Wednesday up to 3 million workers will be on strike (about 10% of the\ntotal workforce) in a long running dispute about the coalition government\u2019s\nplans for \u2018reforming\u2019 the public sector\npensions. A strike of this size has not\nbeen seen since the 1926 General strike\nwith a total of 24 unions involved, including teachers and lecturers, probation officers, library staff, police ci-vilians, refuse collectors, bus drivers,\nnurses, and museum staff.\nAlthough the government likes to\nhighlight how the Unison ballot for\nstrike action only received a 29% turn-out, on average the turnout has been\n44%. This is the same as the turnout for\nthe London mayoral elections, so the\nvote was as representative as our local\ndemocracy. The numbers are also expected to be bolstered by the thousands\nwho join unions in the run-up so that\nthey can strike as well.\nThe government claims to be worried about what they describe to be\nunsustainable pension plans with an\naging population. Their proposals include moving the retirement age to 68,\nincreasing pension contributions, judging the pension on your average salary\ninstead of your final salary, and linking\npensions to the lower CPI inflation instead of the current RPI inflation. This\nhas lead unions to remark that the situation will be one where workers \u2018pay\nmore, work longer, get less\u2019.\nThis involves us, as students, because\nour lecturers will be directly affected\nby these changes to pensions \u2013 both the\nUniversity and College Union and the\nAssociation of Teachers and Lecturers are striking on Wednesday and we\nshould show our support to our lectur-Y\nou may have heard news\nheadlines describing the\nbiggest strike in generations happening on 30th\nNovember, but perhaps\nthought little of it. What has striking got\nto do with students? Especially striking over pensions. Pensions seem ages\naway, we\u2019re only just dealing with our\nstudents loans! The strike may seem\nlike a distant and irrelevant event.\nThis is more than understandable. We,\nthe authors, have been struggling to get\nto grips with the whole idea of the strike\ndespite seeing ourselves as politically\nengaged and politically active \u2013 perhaps\nwe\u2019re just feeling weary after those \u2018total policing\u2019 tactics employed at the November 9th student demo.\nBut it is more than that; as students,\nstriking \u2013 the mass refusal to work by\nemployees demanding concessions\nfrom employers and/or the government\n\u2013 does not seem like something that we\ncan take part in. The language, e.g. the\nuse of the term \u2018workers\u2019, ostensibly\nexcludes us, as well as other groups, including the unemployed.\nHowever, there is in fact a long history of student strikes suggesting that\nthe concept may not be so alien and\nirrelevant to us after all. Furthermore,\nperhaps the idea of striking seems antiquated \u2013 of a time when the majority\nof workers would put down their tools\nin the factory \u2013 not relevant in a service\nsector dominated economy, particularly\nwhen people\u2019s jobs involve care work.\nBack then, striking would cause significant financial losses for the employ-er; in public sector strikes this is not\nthe case. Instead, public sector workers\nwithdrawing their labour has immediate\ners \u2013 speak to them about the issue or\njoin them on the picket line. Or go further than this and arrange events on the\npicket line as students at the University\nof Birmingham have done.\nThe University of Birmingham\nUnion have arranged for a teach-out on\nthe picket with discussions including\n\u2018Whatever happened to the right to protest?\u2019, \u2018Cuts are not the cure\u2019, and \u2018The\nStudent Experience: An Utterly Shallow\nConcept\u2019. Showing our lecturers that we\nrespect the work they do and that we believe they should be fairly rewarded at\nthe end of their job would mean a great\ndeal to them.\nOur collective demand for pensions\njustice is about fairness, however, there\nis also a pragmatic argument to it: simple sums show that in contrast to the\ngovernment\u2019s claims, pensions are in\nfact sustainable in their present state.\nThe National Audit Office, the Office\nfor Budget Responsibility, and the Institute for Fiscal studies all show how as\na proportion of GDP the cost of public\npensions will gradually decrease due to\nchanges made by Labour and that they\nare currently at a peak. Thus, it is quite\nclear that our present pension system for\nthe public sector is sustainable and fair\nas it is.\nYet, the government seems unwilling\nto accept this and back down. Whilst\nthey have made two concessions regarding pensions, these do not go far enough\nto address unions\u2019 and their members\u2019\nmain concerns and therefore they have\nhad to resort to strike action. Epitomising the ineptitude of the government\u2019s\nbargaining in the talks with unions and\njust how little the government understand the grievances of ordinary work-ers, Cabinet Minister Francis Maude\nrecently suggested that workers co-or-dinate a 15 minute strike on N30 \u2013 also\nknown as a tea break.\nHowever, the strike action must not\nbe seen in isolation, as a one-off event\nand solely about pensions. Therefore\nour role in the strike must go beyond\nstudents supporting their lecturers. The\ngovernment\u2019s attack on public sector\npensions is simply yet another example of the government trying to shift\nresponsibility for the deficit on those\nwho cannot pay and who also bear no\nresponsibility for the crisis itself. It is\none attack amongst many which also\ninclude education, healthcare, and welfare \u2013 or everything that is good about\nour society.\nWe cannot know exactly how N30\nwill unfold \u2013 it certainly has the potential to have a tremendous impact with\nmillions of people coming together to\nreject the austerity measures and create\na humane society \u2013 but its significance\nwill be that it is yet another form of\naction following on from and building\non actions by UK Uncut, the Occupy\nmovement, and the student protests that\nshow that a great number of people are\nagainst the government\u2019s austerity programme which is based on making the\npoor pay for an economic crisis that\nthey did not cause.\nThe strike, therefore, is part of a wider\nmovement against the government and\nits policies that is growing in momen-tum. Indeed, this can be seen by James\nSevitt\u2019s remarks from Occupy London\nwhich illustrates how many of these different movements are coming together:\n\u201cAs Occupy London is very much in\nsupport of those unions coming out on\nstrike on Wednesday 30th November,\nwe are busy getting prepared and its\ngreat to see unions lending their support to the Occupy movement. Expect\nto hear more from us about this soon!\u201d\nFurthermore, N30 itself has become\nmore than about pensions \u2013 many other\npeople who don\u2019t work in the public sector will be looking to support the strike,\nas James describes above for Occupy\nLondon. As the Coalition of Resistance\ndescribe \u2018it is clear that November 30th\nalso represents a fundamental challenge\nto the cuts and privatisation programme\nof the ConDem Government.\u2019 They\nhave called for all those against the cuts\nto create a \u2018Festival of Resistance, with\npensioners, students and unemployed\npeople joining together in a massive day\nof defence for jobs, the NHS, the Welfare State, and free education\u2019.\nOur role in this society is not just as\na student, but as a member of our local community, and as a citizen of this\ncountry. It is therefore vital that we participate in this festival to protect what\nwe value in our society, as all of these\nthings are presently under threat.\nTalk with one another, with your\nlecturers on the picket line, join the\nmarches, occupy somewhere, arrange\nteach-outs or teach-ins on campus, do\nanything that you find meaningful, for\nit is a day of possibility.\n\u201cShow our lecturers\nthat we respect the\nwork they do.\u201d\nNovember 30th: day of action\nIzzy Koksal and Luke Sheldon on why students should care about Wednesday\u2019s strikes\nFEATURE\n6 FELIX\nFriday 25 november 2011\nFeatures Editors: Katy Bettany\nStephen Smith\nfeatures.felix@gmail.com\nGet involved\nNovember 29th:\nStrike rally\nSOAS, 7pm\nNovember 30th:\nStudent march\nUniversity of London\nUnion, 11am\nMore details:\nfalseeconomy.org.uk\npcs.org.uk\nWhy I\u2019m striking: three strikers explain what has caused their outrage\n\u201cI will be striking on N30. It\u2019s absolutely outrageous cutting pensions. I do feel ambivalent; to forfeit a wadge\nof money, when my wage is very low does worry me\ngreatly, however, what they are doing is obscene. It\nis outrageous pensions are not protected, they\u2019re not\nfantastic anyway. You work the best years of your life\nfor the pensions, which are then attacked, it\u2019s morally\nwrong to attack our pensions. I\u2019d like to do something\nmeaningful and valuable, I think I\u2019ll picket the library\nand town hall. It seems really important to do something meaningful with the time. \u201c\nSusan Appleton, Library Assistant, London\n\u201cI\u2019m striking and angry. The spineless gits are attacking the pensions of average earners in a thinly veiled\ntactic to reduce the deficit that we didn\u2019t cause. They\neven changed the offer to cost us more in the short\nterm but promising more long term, condemning future governments whilst making money for theirs.\u201d\nJames Sheehan, Science Teacher, Liverpool\n\u201cI\u2019m currently unemployed after finishing my master\u2019s degree, so I can\u2019t strike in the traditional way of\nstopping work, however I will be outside my local Job\nCentre and picketing there in order to demand better\nwelfare provision and meaningful jobs. Just because\nstrikes are traditionally associated with workers does\nnot mean that the unemployed cannot take part and\ndemand rights for themselves, in fact, it is absolutely\nvital that we take a stand. The situation for us is appalling \u2013 not only is there a great deal of stigma linked\nwith claiming unemployment benefits (as if the individual is choosing to be unemployed) rather than realising that it could happen to anyone \u2013 but the amount\nyou are given to survive on is an insult. Just look at\nthe present climate with thousands of jobs being cut\n\u2013 it is clearly not an individual\u2019s fault if they find themselves out of work. I hope that N30 will see millions\ntake to the streets against this government sending\na clear message that we do not accept their cuts.\u201d\nElizabeth Milne, Unemployed, London\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 25 NOVEMber 2011 19\nW\nhen a friend came\nfrom home to visit\nme this weekend,\nthe Occupy protest\nat St Paul\u2019s Cathedral was an obvious stop on the tourist\ntrail. Whether you agree with the protestors or not, the creation of a functioning\ntent civilisation with its own library,\nmedia centre and even a \u2018university\u2019 is\nreally quite impressive. But you don\u2019t\nneed to see what they\u2019ve done to the\nCity of London landscape to see the impact they\u2019ve had on the political arena\n\u2013 our economy and society are under the\nmicroscope like never before in our gen-eration. And as the long suffering Felix\nComment editors know only too well,\nthe debate has been raging fiercely in\nthese pages.\nThe Occupy legitimacy debate has\nbeengoingonformorethanlongenough.\nBut one thing that has come out of it,\nand other related pieces in this paper, is\nthe prevalence of a certain view among\nsome students in this college. This isn\u2019t\na question of the standard right/left divide \u2013 there are perfectly sensible people and arguments on either side \u2013 it\u2019s\na question of attitude, of outlook. Your\npolitical opinions should be formed by\nan honest look at the world around you\nand by thinking how best it should, and\nrealistically can, be organised. But in addressing the issue of poverty and why it\nexists, certain commenters have instead\nRory Fenton\nPoverty should occupy your mind\nchosen to justify and defend their own\nsocial positions at all cost, as a default,\nregardless of the consequences and self-delusions involved.\nWithout naming names, we were here\ntold that poverty is \u201cthe appalling situation that ten abysmal years of serially incompetent socialist Labour government\nhas created\u201d. Which is curious, because\nI recall poverty existing before 1997.\nBut more fundamentally this betrays an\ninstinct to blame first and think later, if\nat all. The world is simply more complicated than that.\nMost of us, myself included, have\nvery little experience of what it is like to\nlive below the poverty line in the UK. I\nhave always wanted to believe that you\ncan achieve anything if you work hard\nenough at it, and in my own life I have\nfound this to be fairly true. And surely\nif you work hard you should enjoy the\nfruits of that labour? Bankers work\nbloody hard and get duly compensated\nfor it. The problem is this: they aren\u2019t\nthe only ones working hard. Few Imperial students will have to know what\nit is to wake up early to take the bus to\nwork because you can\u2019t afford the tube.\nSurely that too is hard work. Few of us\nwill know what it is to go to a school\nwhere we are branded collectively as\nfailures, where we are only ever expected to achieve a few GCSE passes\nand feel the overwhelming pressure to\nsimply comply. For most of us, the road\nto success has been clear and defined \u2013\nwe go to good schools, get spoon fed our\nA Levels and get into a great university.\nOf course this takes hard work along the\nway but it is a clear and well-trodden\npath. Just how open is this path to the\n14 year old in a failing comprehensive?\nThat 38% of students here were privately educated should give you some idea.\nTo be poor is to face challenges beyond what most of us are used to. To rise\nabove them is laudable but it is all too\nrare. There are undoubtedly lazy people\nin this world who earn very little and\nhard working people who earn a great\ndeal but to infer that those who are poor\nmust therefore deserve it is a failure of\nunderstanding.\nPoverty is a complex issue with no\neasy solution. But simply laying the\nblame at the feet of feckless individuals and an overgenerous government is\nunhelpful, lazy and cruel. Where exactly\npoverty\u2019s \u201csolution\u201d will come from is\nstill a subject of much debate, although\nit\u2019s clear that it won\u2019t necessarily come\nfrom the left (New Labour showed pretty well that simply throwing money at\npoverty won\u2019t make it go away). But until we face up to the realities of the challenges faced by the poor in this country,\nno meaningful debate can be had.\n\u201d\nTo be poor is to\nface challenges\nbeyond what most\nof us are used to.\nTo rise above them\nis laudable but it\nis all too rare\n\u201c\nTo be\nTo be\nface c\nface c\nPoverty is a complex issue with no set solution\nDidn\u2019t think so.\nCat got your\ntongue?\nFELIX\nIs there a burning issue that\nyou want to write about?\nEmail comment.felix@imperial.\nac.uk.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 45\nSPORT\nFriday 25 november 2011\n...Continued from back page\nFencing: promising weekend\nSport Editors: Indy Leclercq\nDavid Wilson\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAs before, the outcome of the match\nwas to be decided in the epee; as be-fore, it was a nerve-wracking affair. The\nepeeists started out with an 11-point\nlead which they had to maintain to win\nthe match. As it went on, though, Bristol asserted their dominance and the\nImperial fencers saw their lead shrink.\nOnce again it came down to Harry, anchoring epee, to win his match against\nMatt Billing, Bristol\u2019s best fencer, to\nbe able to win the match overall. Both\nsides were feverishly tallying the scores\nto figure out when the match would be\nput beyond doubt. Unfortunately for\nBristol, they were doing the sums a bit\ntoo feverishly and got them wrong (or,\naccording to them, \u2018misread the score\nsheet\u2019) \u2013 meaning that when the final\nthree minutes were up, both sides started cheering, to mutual bewilderment. In\nthe end, though a team with two physicists and a mathematician were always\ngoing to get it right and IC came off\nwith a one point victory, 101-100.\nThe final match against Oxford was\nto prove a clash of titans, as both teams\nhad won all their matches and had been\non form all weekend. Having lost the\ntoss, sabre went first, producing a comprehensive win to put Imperial almost\nthirty points ahead. The foilists then\nwent ahead to try and put the match beyond reach; however what started off as\na closely-fought match crumbled into a\nten-point win for Oxford. It was up to\nthe epeeists to save the day. In the most\nnerve-wracking moment of the week-end, they had to reach twenty-seven\nhits to be able to claim victory for the\nteam\u2026but it was not to be. The final\nscore was an agonisingly close 45-26\nto Oxford, meaning the two teams were\nperfectly tied, 98-98. The fact that Oxford won two weapons, though, meant\nthat victory was theirs, and a dejected\nImperial team made their way back\ndown to London.\nOverall, the weekend was a positive\nresult, though, and the the motivation to\nwin everything at the next premiership\nweekend is greater than ever.\nOn Saturday, the Imperial Eagles set out\nto play their first competitive match in\nthe Development League. The planned\nopening game betweenBy now, several\nchanges to the league schedule were undertaken after Olympia II pulled out of\nthe division, which meant that instead\nof facing the Ruislip Eagles II, Imperial\nhad to face the Newham Flames, who\nwere often praised for their extensive\nyouth development and link to the GB\nU16 squad, where some of their players\nreceive very extensive training - or so\nwe thought.\nDuring the warm up period, the lack\nof skill and variation in the admittedly\nvery young teams game was becoming\nmore and more obvious and they failed\nto surprise a well-trained Eagles site in\ndecent form.\nThe Flames showed great spirit and\nnever stopped fighting for what would\nhave been their first ever competitive\nvictory, but, despite catching the Eagles\u2019\ndefense off guard on several occasions,\nfailed to match the scoring and goal-keeping abilities of their very handsome\nopponents.\nNewham tried to move the ball fast in\nattack, but could not exert much pressure on IC team, unless their physically intimidating centre-back set out\nto storm towards the 6-metre line, with\nwhich he was successful on a few oc-casions. Neither of their wingers was\nable to stretch the game and create\nspace for an over-motivated pivot,\nwhich narrowed their attack down to\ntheir berserker and a marfanoid-looking\nleft-back, who despite of his impressive\nheight of over 2m, was unable to make\na real impression on Imperials veteran\ngoalkeeper, Stefan Bauer, who is slowly\nrediscovering his true form after a good\npre-season and managed to save an impressive 3 penalties in a row.\nIn attack, the Imperial Eagles were\nlacking the patience to play well renown\nschemes like \u201cWurst\u201d and \u201cHeidi\u201d,\nleading to some hasty and unsuccessful\nshots. However, superior counter-at-tacks and some individual skills meant\nthat Newham would concede 29 goals\nby the end of the 60 minutes.\nAt this point, it is important to point\nout that our president, Kolja Ortmann,\nscored a counter attack, which should\nbe an indicator of the level of resistance\nImperial had to face.\nAll in all, this game was a good way\nto ease players back into the routine\nof the Development League before IC\nis set to face stronger opponents, such\nas Great Dane II, Ruislip Eagles II and\narch enemies UCL, who have yet to beat\nImperial in a league match.\nHowever, considering that some of\nthe Newham Flames\u2019 players are hailed\nas Engalnds Handball hope, everyone\nwould have hoped for a more challenging game.\nStefan Bauer\nHandball\nImperial Eagles 29\nNewham Flames 16\nVictory for Eagles\nSo, according to Bristol, 1+1=3.

I\nIT\nT\n5\nFELIX Friday 25 november 2011\nNEWS\nGospel Choir has the X Factor\nIf you were watching ITV closely this\nSaturday evening you may have seen\nsome familiar faces. Members of the\nImperial College Gospel Choir (ICGC)\nwere featured giving it their all, with\ntheir best clicks, jazz hands and on Saturday evening\u2019s live edition of The X\nFactor.\n15 members of ICGC and 25 members of King\u2019s College Gospel Choir\nwere recruited to perform with Marcus Collins, one of the X Factor con-testants, in his number of the week\n\u2018Higher and Higher\u2019, (originally sung\nby Jackie Wilson). The performance\nwas crowned the \u201cperformance of\nthe night\u201d by Gary Barlow, and Kelly\nRowland commented on the energy of\nthe act which could be credited in some\nrespect to the enthusiasm of the choir.\nSix girls from the joint Imperial/King\u2019s\nCollege choir were also selected to feature in Amelia Lily\u2019s performance of\nthe Aretha Franklin song \u2018Think\u2019.\nOne of the X Factor producers commented after the show that the choir\nwas, \u201cThe best choir we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\nThis then led to half the choir spontaneously bursting into tears and wild\nscreeches that almost brought down\ntheir porter-cabin dressing room.\nThe gospel choirs were selected for\nthe show as a result of their involvement in July\u2019s University Gospel Choir\nof the Year competition, in which both\nICGC and King\u2019s College were final-ists. In true showbiz fashion the news\nof the upcoming appearance was very\nlast minute. Members of the choir\nlearnt of their potential TV debut at\nlunch time on Thursday, and confirmation that they had a place on the show\nwas only received on Friday morning.\nThe choir spent all day Saturday at\nthe ITV studios in Wembley Park,\nwhere they were taught their routine\nby the show\u2019s choreographers. The rest\nof the day was spent rehearsing\u2026 and\ndiscreetly stalking various members\nof the X Factor team. As evidence on\nFacebook shows, this was very produc-tive.\nSaturday has brought welcome publicity for a thriving and fast growing\nImperial society. Christina CrossetteThambiah, President of ICGC commented that she \u201cnever could have\ndreamed something like this could\nhave happened to ICGC\u201d. Chris Farrell, one of the original members of the\nchoir when it was founded six years\nago, said he remembered when the\nchoir was only \u201cten people gathered\nround a piano\u201d.\nWith rumours of the joint choir being called back for the X Factor final,\nstaged live at Wembley Arena on December 11, the sky is the limit and everyone involved is excited about what\nis to come. However, the choir can be\nseen in action a little closer to home at\ntheir Christmas concert at Holy Trinity church on Prince Consort Road\non December 13; tickets are available\nthrough the Union website.\nITV\nTobi Obisanya\nGenevieve Pugh\nThe university Gospel Choirs performing alongside contestant Marcus\nCollins\n\n"

This time round\nthough it doesn\u2019t happen. Shit.\nAries\nThis week, when asked, you say: \u201cI don\u2019t\nwant the person driving the train I\u2019m on\nto have just had a joint\u201d. You work with\ndrug addicts and therefore have proof that\nsomething being illegal doesn\u2019t mean it\ncan\u2019t be done. You still don\u2019t realise that\nyour argument is fucking stupid.\nTaurus\nThis week you take stuff that you find\nin a small baggie on the back seat of the\nN9 bus. As you haven\u2019t a clue what it is\nexactly, you rub some on your gums and\nsnort the rest. Turns out it was cat nip,\nand now there are 7 cats pawing at your\nface constantly. Drugs are bad.\nGemini\nThis week you cut your finger while\npreparing some dinner. The surge of\nrelease when you see the blood flow\nmakes you want to do it again. Rushing\nto the bathroom you start slicing away\nat the top of your thigh. You really will\ndo anything to procrastinate.\nCancer\nThis week a helicopter lands in your\nback garden. Barack Obama steps out\nand cries \u201cSophie, I love you,\u201d and you\nstart making wild love. You decide that\nthis isn\u2019t reality as your name isn\u2019t Sophie. And anyway you hate black guys\nand would never sleep with one. Racist.\nLeo\nThis week one of your friends is whing-ing to you about how a guy won\u2019t text\nher back even though your impression\nof the situation is that she\u2019s been a complete demanding bitch towards him. You\ntry and think of the most sensitive way\nto put this to her. One black eye later,\nyou decide you probably failed.\nVirgo\nThis week you retire from your position\nof power and authority over the country\nand decide to say that cannabis should\nbe legal. Everyone is incensed at your\ntiming, because, if you\u2019d decided to\ndo something about it while you were\nin charge you could have achieved\nsomething\u2026\nLibra\nThis week week you\u2019re so broke the\nonly thing you can afford to do is mas-turbate. Unfortunately after your 9th\ntime you\u2019re so dry that you snap your\nbanjo string. Upon presenting your predicament to the GP you get offered a\ngrand to go on Embarrassing Bodies.\nSagittarius\nThis week you arrive at the set for\nEmbarrassing Bodies. Dr Christian\nspends what feels like an age looking\nat your damaged instrument. Your dick\nstill in his hands, you faint on live TV.\nYou become a YouTube sensation.\nScore!\nCapricorn\nThis week you decide to take a bold\nstep and set up #occupyqueenstower as\na protest movement at how shit the girl\nto boy ratio is at uni. To be honest, in\nthe grand scheme of things it\u2019s barely\nTahrir Square, more a lonely wanker in\na tower. You wank, on your own.\nAquarius\nThis week you are beheaded. To be\nhonest going to the Democratic Republic\nof Congo is never a good idea but you\nfigured after playing 46 hours of CoD:\nMW3 you might be quick enough with\na gun to carve yourself a little empire.\nLong story short, you\u2019re not.\nPisces\nThis week you find yourself in a hurry\nwhile in the lab and forget if it\u2019s \u2018always\nadd Acid to Water\u2019or \u2018always add Water\nto Acid\u2019. You get it wrong. The resulting foaming, caustic mess ruins your\nnew trainers. Does wonders for your\nskin though.\nHANGMAN\n*Living on borrowed time, a little like James Murdoch\u2019s humble acting skills\nThe\nIlliterate\nBook\nClub\nThe Books section is for you if you can read the words\non the pages but not between the lines. You need\neverything spoon-fed to you like a kid in GCSE English\nwho needs Of Mice and Men explained to him. The\norangutan below could use a stick better than he can.\nThis book answers one of life\u2019s most enduring questions: one that\nnobody has ever really cared about nor even asked that often, but it is\nas old as Indonesian proto-humans who were doing ayahuasca while\nwatching some hairy ginger swinging through the trees. In a typical\nexample of \u201ccan\u2019t see the forest for the trees\u201d, the writers of this\nbook didn\u2019t even see how similar the two words are, and that maybe\nthe word orange was derived from the word orangutan. Instead, this\nproves to baffle with scientific mumbo-jumbo that serves nothing\nmore than to give the knuckle-dragging masses something to impress\ntheir \u2018mates\u2019 at the pub with, while keeping it simple enough for their\nunder-developed brains to handle. It\u2019s about as informative as the\ningredients list on a shampoo bottle: you don\u2019t know what any of those\nchemicals do, you\u2019re only reading it because there\u2019s nothing else and\npermanently associated with bowel motions.\nStuff Imperial students hate\nHaving 10 guys awkwardly standing\nin a circle on the dancefloor\nA weekly experience throughout first year.\nWhy are none of them dancing?

Wait, what\u2019s that in the pocket of the guy who\nlikes all of my holiday pictures from 3 months ago? Oh,\nit\u2019s only a gun. Oh god, get me out of here!*\n*And then you wake up. Later that night, you go to\nMetric and the same thing happens.

Lift each one up in turn and just\nstamp on the spot. On second thoughts, waiting for 20\nminutes at a bar is probably better than this.\nIf you want to go super-incognito, just stand completely\nstill and vaguely nod your head while clutching your\ndrink for dear life. Don\u2019t drink it too quickly, though:\nit\u2019s all you\u2019re doing right now that doesn\u2019t look insanely\nstupid.

    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: John Park\nLucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nRecommended films this week\nTake Shelter (15) \u2013 Plagued by disturbing visions\nof the Apocalypse, a dedicated family man\u2019s\nstrength and sanity is put to the test as terror\nand paranoia start to eat away at him. Michael\nShannon portrays one of the most likable, relat-able American heroes in recent memory with quiet\nintensity, whereas rising star Jessica Chastain\npitches in a moving supporting turn as the concerned wife. Without a doubt one of the best films\nof the year, Take Shelter treats the audience with a\nfascinating blend of family drama and some haunting disaster film special effects.\nMoneyball (12A) \u2013 You don\u2019t need to know a thing\nabout baseball to be wholly captivated by this\nmoving sports drama of beating the odds. More\ninterested in the dynamic between a struggling\nteam\u2019s general manager and his various obstacles\nthan on-field matches themselves, Brad Pitt gives\na self-confident, cheeky, yet warm performance\nas Billy Beane, a real-life character who brought\nabout a string of unprecedented victories for his\njoke of a team, the Oakland Athletics. With solid\nsupporting turns from Jonah Hill and the ever-so\nreliable Philip Seymour Hoffman, Moneyball is a\nheartfelt, moving piece of work.\n50/50 (15) \u2013 Another film about fighting against\nthe impossible, this time it\u2019s about surviving a\nrare form of spinal cancer. When a young man in\nhis 20\u2019s (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is diagnosed with\nan aggressive tumour that gives him a chance of\nsurvival of 50%, he must find a way to cope and\nlive through its many painful effects. Supported by\nhis best friend (the hilarious Seth Rogen), his amateur therapist (the warm and sweet Anna Kendrick) and his slightly over-bearing mother (Anjelica\nHuston in a supporting role that is finally worthy of\nher name and phenomenal talent), our brave hero\nfights and finds humour along with his fight for\nsurvival. With its delicate balance between drama\nand comedy, this is one of the most touching, yet\nhysterical films of the year.\nMy Week with Marilyn (15) \u2013 Michelle Williams\ngives the performance of a lifetime as the late\nAmerican icon, Marilyn Monroe. Whilst filming\nThe Prince and the Showgirl in London opposite\nLaurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh), the director\u2019s\nassistant (Eddie Redmayne) catches the eye of\nMonroe. Desperate to escape her hectic life and\npressures of work and celebrity, the two decide\nto run away to the peaceful English countryside.\nThe two fall for one another, despite the fact that\nMonroe is a married woman. It\u2019s a tragic love\nstory, although peppered with light humour here\nand there. For fans of Monroe this is a must-see,\nand anyone yearning for a breezy light-hearted film\nshould also check this one out.\nAnd one to avoid...\nDream House (15) \u2013 A predictable, painfully slow\nhaunted house horror that drags on for far too long\nrelying on its ridiculous twists, there hasn\u2019t been\na more scare-free film with a cast as good as this.\nDaniel Craig and Rachel Weisz act well together,\nbut even their chemistry cannot elevate this sub-par effort from being nothing more than a lazy attempt that starts off with a good idea, but ends\nwith many of its obvious genre clich\u00e9s. You want\na better Rachel Weisz film? Watch The Deep Blue\nSea (also out this week) instead.\nFELIX\n28 Friday 25 november 2011\nWorldwide more people have access to mobile phones than a toilet \u2013 GREEN WEEK 2011\nA couple of weeks ago, the British Sikh Doctors\nOrganisation and Imperial Sikh Society worked\ntogether to put on an outstanding meet and greet\nevent with Sikhs from all around London, a few\ncharities and talks on a variety of topics, culminating in the screening of the new-to-the-UK\nmovie: Ocean of Pearls. Director Sarab Singh\nNeelam, a doctor living in Michigan, originally\nhad the idea based on countless real life experiences of migrants throughout the world. Ocean\nof Pearls won multiple awards at various film\nfestivals: Best Feature Film at the Detroit Film\nFestival in 2009 and the Grand Jury Prize and\nAudience Choice Award at the 2008 Los Angeles Pacific Film Festival, to name a few.\nThe story follows Amrit Singh (Abtahi),\nwhose family moved to Toronto, Canada, and\nis largely involved in the Sikh community developing there. Amrit shows himself to be a\nhardworking doctor and practising Sikh, though\nhe never really understands why his family left\n\u201cthe old country\u201d to be in Canada, yet still follows the old ways. I\u2019m sure many of you, even\nthose who aren\u2019t Sikh, know what it is like to be\nin a foreign country and can relate to the experiences shown.\nAmrit is approached with an excellent job opportunity in Detroit with millions of dollars of\nfunding for leading a team in his research, if he\ncan impress the board of directors. He soon realises though, that if he really wants to achieve\nhis goals and get the money he needs, he will\nneed to be \u201cflexible\u201d and adaptable, even going\nI\u2019m a Rocky Horror Picture Show virgin. Or,\nat least, I was a Rocky Horror Picture Show\nvirgin until last Thursday, when my innocence was taken from me in a flash of lin-gerie, transvestitism, and hilarious heckling.\nMusical Theatre Society provided the girls,\nguys, and the pizazz, while iCU Cinema provided the film that\u2019s built a rock-solid cult\nfollowing since 1970s.\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show, for those\nwho don\u2019t know, is a weird and perverse musical about the sexy and mad Dr. Frank-NFurter (played by Tim Curry) and a straightedge married couple\u2019s, Janet Weiss (SLUT!)\nand Brad Majors (ASSHOLE!), release into\ndebauchery.\nBut this is much more than a film. It truly\nis an experience. For those in the know, it\u2019s\na chance to dance, to sing, and to heckle the\nscreen. Whenever anyone in the film says Janet (SLUT!) or Brad (ASSHOLE!), scores of\npeople scream \u2018slut\u2019or \u2018asshole\u2019at the screen.\nThe narrator is derided for his apparent lack\nof a neck, and that horror film plot device of\ngoing to an old castle because your car broke\ndown is lampooned as people shout, \u201cCASTLES DON\u2019T HAVE TELEPHONES,\u201d at the\nhapless characters.\nHowever, if you\u2019re not in the know, if\nyou\u2019re a Rocky virgin (as indicated by the \u2018V\u2019\ndrawn on your forehead by the MTSoc guys\nand gals running around in lingerie) the effect of all this madness is really quite smart.\nYou end up mimicking the experience of Janet (SLUT!) and Brad (ASSHOLE!) They\u2019ve\nturned up at this weird castle with a bunch\nof barely-dressed people, and you\u2019ve turned\nup to iCU Cinema with a bunch of barely-dressed Imperialites. They\u2019re taken aback by\nthe dancing and aren\u2019t sure what to do, and\nyou\u2019re\u2026 well you get the gist.\nBy the end of the show, though, you\u2019ve\nbeen converted (rather like Janet [SLUT!]\nand Brad [ASSHOLE!]) You begin to look at\nthe people in lingerie and begin to feel like\nyour jeans are a bit\u2026 stifling. But don\u2019t tell\nmy mother I said that.\nso far as to compromise his ethics and his identi-ty. During one tearful scene, Amrit cuts his hair,\nshedding the turban image and devoting himself to get that job. Meanwhile, his family and\ngirlfriend notice how aloof he has become and\nthough Amrit keeps it a secret, soon he reveals\nthat he cut his hair in a heated debate with his\nfather. How does his life go on from there? Does\nhe meet his ends and achieve the top job? You\u2019ll\nhave to watch and find out.\nHowever, what is important is that while there\nappears to be a Pursuit of Happyness theme\nin terms of Amrit and his profession, there is\na much deeper and more significant message:\nshould outsiders compromise there identity\nto realize their dreams? Many of our Imperial\nCollege London colleagues are foreign students\nand know how intimidating it can be being in a\nstrange new country, where people ridicule us\nfor our looks, our accent or our beliefs. It does\nseem so much easier to give in and be like everyone else. For Amrit, the choice to remove his\nhair was made so he could present a recognisable face to not just his board of directors, but\nto the subconsciously xenophobic community\nhe finds himself in.\nIs this the way forward? For each of us, we\nhave to make the choice and that means deciding whether we will follow our dreams to the\nend, regardless of what we may have to give up,\nor remaining steadfast in our beliefs, despite the\nsetbacks, despite the bullying, despite the racism\nthat threatens us. Amrit\u2019s father says during the\nfilm that during a period of Sikh history, there\nwas a bounty on every Sikh head and anybody\nknown to be a Sikh was instantly put to death.\nDespite this, the Sikhs did not cut their hair or\nshirk away; they proudly wore their turbans and\ndenounced the injustice, fighting against terrible\nodds. I\u2019m sure a lot of you have seen the film\n300? The odds were stacked even higher against\nthem.\nI know I\u2019ve talked a lot about Sikhs in this, but\nit really applies to everyone. Whether you are\noriental, African American or European, female\nor male, disabled or suffer from illness, I\u2019m sure\nthat we\u2019ve all experienced prejudice in our lives,\nbut we all have the right to be treated fairly and\nequally. We all have things which make us who\nwe are and you just wouldn\u2019t be you without\nthem. However, we must make sure that when\nchasing that \u00a310m dollar contract, we do not\nlose sight of our ideals, our history, our identity.\nUltimately, the choice lies with you.\nA pearl in the ocean\nPavitar Devgon\nDirector Sarab Singh Neelam\nScreenwriters V.

We need more\nstands and security\nFELIX\nFriday 25 NOVEMBER 2011\nWelcome to Imperial: a place to get educat-ed, entertained and inspired, a place to make\nnew friends, discover new hobbies and build\nyour skills for the future. One way of being inspired and discovering life outside of\nthe College campus is to volunteer with IntoUniversity.\nWe met with Alex Ho who is a 4th Year\nMedical student and volunteered with IntoUniversity last year.\nIntoUniversity is an organisation which\nsupports children from disadvantaged backgrounds to discover their full potential. It\noffers innovative programmes to help pupils\nimprove their academic performance, and to\ngive them opportunities to make educated\nchoices about their future. These activities\nare co-ordinated in partnership with the College Outreach Office.\nAlex told us that she ended up volunteering\nas a mentor for over a year, though initially\nshe was just looking to work with young\npeople as this was something she had not\ndone previously.\n\u201cVolunteering at IntoUniversity allowed\nme to meet people I would never have\ncrossed paths with otherwise and I really\nhope that my mentee and I stay in touch for\na long time to come. I learnt that as a mentor\nyou have to be a teacher, a role model and an\nadvisor but most importantly a friend. This\nis because to be an effective mentor, it\u2019s really important that your mentee feels comfortable and enjoys working with you.\u201d\nVolunteering with IntoUniversity did,\nhowever, present challenges to Alex who\nsaid that \u201cthe hardest part of the job was\nmaintaining the right balance between being\na friend and a mentor, with a young person\nwho may be looking for you to support them\nin their school work, social life and future\nplans. It\u2019s important to gain their trust whilst\nalso sometimes maintaining a respectful distance.\u201d\nAlthough volunteering is a commitment\nand requires a lot of juggling between one\u2019s\nGet out there and volunteer!\nstudies and other life priorities, it is something Alex would definitely recommend to\nother students. \u201cThe need to set aside time to\nvolunteer actually helps you to organise your\nschedule \u2013 IntoUniversity are also a really\nsupportive charity who are doing some great\nwork, so get involved while you can!\u201d\nShe continued \u201cworking with my mentee\nwas a great experience and made a pleasant\nchange to my week. You forget how many unknowns there are at that age, sometimes with\nno one to ask, so hopefully with the support\nfrom IntoUniversity our mentees will feel in\na better position to make the right decisions\nfor themselves and their futures. Working at\nIntoUniversity also made me think about my\nown future... perhaps in paediatrics!\u201d\nIntoUniversity provides training to help\nvolunteers to participate in an appropriate\nprogramme. The dates of those events can\nbe found on Union\u2019s calendar as well as on\nthe Imperial College Volunteering Website\nhttp://www3.imperial.ac.uk/volunteering/\nhowtovolunteer/intouniversity.\nBikes are great, but getting your bike stolen isn\u2019t.\nPretty simple stuff, but at Imperial an average of\ntwo bikes per day are stolen. Now I\u2019m sure that\nsome of them are down to the individual, but I think\na big part is the facilities and security available at\nImperial. That\u2019s why the Bike Users Group has started up a petition for an increased amount of stands\nand an overview of security for bike parking.\nI\u2019ll get back to what college should do, but it\u2019s\nyour bike, so let\u2019s do things sensibly. When you see\nbikes locked with a chain that a mouse could chew\nthrough, or maybe nothing locking the bike frame\nto something solid, you just have to wonder. I\u2019ve\nbeen there, and the worst thing about getting your\nbike stolen, even if it\u2019s a rubbish bike, is the fact\nthat you don\u2019t have that option anymore. I know it\nsounds obvious, but if you cycle a bit, not having\nyour bike is a killer, now you have to go back to going slower, and paying for a smelly journey. So let\u2019s\nall promise to lock up our frames with a solid D-lock\n(Sherfield security sells them for under half price\u00a328) or a motorbike chain, then something piddly\nfor the wheels etc.\nNow, if this all magically happened, it would be\ngreat, but bikes would still be stolen. If you\u2019ve ever\nused the faculty building bike park, you\u2019ll know that\nyou can\u2019t have your bike upright in the stand and\nlock the frame (at least with one lock you can\u2019t).\nIf I had my way, and money wasn\u2019t an issue, all of\nthese stands would be replaced for ones that can\nbe used securely. But it\u2019s not just that, the stands\nthemselves are mostly unscrewed and wobbly, you\ncould even slide locked bikes out of them as they\nare at the moment! Then when your bike does get\nstolen, we\u2019ve been told that there wasn\u2019t a clear\nenough image on the CCTV to do anything with.\nA couple of years ago, there were a lot more Sheffield stands. The way I hear it, the Rector at the time\ndidn\u2019t like the look of bikes, so got rid of them. Well\nwe\u2019ve got a different Rector now anyway, so why\ndon\u2019t we have more Sheffield stands outside build-ings? Obviously they can\u2019t be in the way of vehicles,\ndisabled access and fire congregation points, but\nthere are plenty of spaced which would be perfect.\nSouth Kensington is one thing, but it is almost impossible to lock your bike up in some of the other\ncampuses after 10, so we need more stands.\nSo this brings me to what we are doing. We have\na petition for effectively changing or reviewing all\nof the above at tiny.cc/icbugpetition. Whilst you\u2019re\nthere, you can also sign up to the Bike Users Group,\neither a discussion forum for bike users or an announcement list for all events like police marking,\nDr. Bike sessions and auctions.\nStefan Piatek\nAndy Yu\nFellwanderers roam Peak District\n5.30pm on Friday evening. The first fellwan-derers made their way to the Union, eager to\nleave London after a hard week of work. We\nquickly gathered together, packing out two\nbuses, and excitedly awaited our trip.\nLeaving London proved rather challenging as cars seemed to be invading the roads,\nleading our driver, Sarah, to despair. However, the rest of the journey to Derbyshire\nwent without a hitch and, after an epic race\nin the countryside, both teams (miraculous-ly) reached our destination \u2013 the village of\nEdale \u2013 safe and sound. With everyone giving a hand to unload the minibuses, settling\nin the hut only took a few minutes. Following\nour captain Heather\u2019s orders, we all curled\nup in our sleeping bags, looking forward to\nour first day walking in the Peak District.\nAwakening to the lovely sound of a familiar Disney song on Saturday morning all the\nfell wanderers started to bustle about, some\nhaving breakfast and others making sandwiches for lunch. At 8.30am we are all set\nto start hiking. The fresh air helped to rouse\nthe last sleepy hikers of the group. Whilst the\nfirst part of the walk was largely uneventful,\nsome of us soon got caught by the High Peak\nDistrict wet and muddy areas; very happy\nmemories indeed for two (unnamed) hikers\nwho got bogged down in the marsh! Half a\ndozen fellow team members were needed to\nrescue them - no photos are available of this\nunfortunate experience though.\nA subsequent lunch break enabled us to recover from our fight with the mud. We then\nset off up Rushup Edge and were amazed at\nthe number of paragliders flying up there.\nLooking at them was always an astonishing sight; paragliding is something probably everyone would like to experience, if\nvertigo was not a worry. We stopped for a\nfew minutes, staring at these \u2018flocks\u2019 invading the skies, before moving on to Mam Tor.\nWe are lucky to have a sunny afternoon to\nadmire the stunning views over Edale. The\nlast part of the walk involved cutting across\nthe fields, and we soon reached the pub to\nhave one or two longed-for drinks. Back\nin the hut, we found James and his team of\ncooking volunteers preparing dinner. Today\u2019s\nmenu consisted of pasta, the traditional meal\nfor hungry fellwanderers. The evening was\nhighly enjoyable as we got to know each other better. The vast majority of the group then\nopted for a few drinks at the pub to conclude\nthe day.\nIt was not even that hard to wake up on\nSunday morning! After a quick breakfast,\nwe started packing our rucksacks and loaded\nthem in the buses before setting off to the\nLadybower Reservoir. There we began our\nhike, slightly disappointed to see dark clouds\nlooming in the skies. After a short walk in\nthe forest, we soon started scrambling on the\npath leading to White Tor, which has some\nvery impressive grit stone formations. From\nthere we might have witnessed the breathtaking views of the Derwent Valley Reservoirs,\nhowever fate (or more precisely weather) decided otherwise. After a few hundred yards\nfrom the Wheel Stones we followed the path\nheading back down to the Derwent Reservoir\nwhere we stopped to have lunch. Everyone\nthen agreed to have a look at Howden Dam\nbefore setting off again.\nThe afternoon walk along the Reservoir\nwas enthralling. We stopped to see the ruins of Derwent village on our way back to\nAshopton. Our hiking adventure in the Peak\nDistrict came to an end on a pub\u2019s terrace,\nwith everyone enjoying a well-earned drink\nas well as the beautiful Derbyshire land-scapes, before heading back to London.\nClaire Roseren\nFellwanderers shamelessly hire a fleet of paragliders as part of their new and extreme measures to ensure the best possible photo opportunity\nDavid Sutanto\nMatthew Colvin\n\n"

After overcoming that bitter morning sensation we\npeered from our hostel window to see\nwhat appeared to be a hot-rod straight\nout of Kill Bill: we hopped in and it\nroared through the dark, dusty streets of\nJaipur and took us to our take-off point.\nThanks to travelling during monsoon\nwe had a spot of drama as the team decided whether or not a flight was even\npossible. We were well catered for\nand sat with milky, sugary chai and\nsoft biscuits as we cursed the black\nclouds overhead. Thankfully the winds\nsubsided and the rains decided to be\nfashionably late, and the balloon was\ninflated and set to go.\nDiscontent with the restricted views offered by India\u2019s tuk-tuks, Chris Richardson\ntakes to the skies to catch a bird\u2019s eye view of India\u2019s Golden Triangle\nAfter being put at ease by an excellent English-speaking team and a\nmandatory safety briefing, we let the\nwinds carry us over the villages surrounding Jaipur. Ballooning is much\nmore graceful than I\u2019d anticipated, so I\nwas able to toss aside the concerns of a\nDelhi-belly and really enjoy the views.\nAnd what views they were! It\u2019s not\noften I get to say \u201cI\u2019m so glad we came\nfor the monsoon!\u201d but this was one of\nthose rare gems: the usually arid shrubland was lit up as a spectacular sea\n\u201cthe usually arid\nshrubland was lit up\nas a spectacular sea\nof green\u201d\nKicking back with a chai while the Sky Waltz team get the show on the road\nof green, made all-the-plusher by the\nplentiful monsoon rains. A calm breeze\ncooled us as we gazed over rocky hills\nin the distance and vibrant Jaipur city\nwith its quaint Amber Fort closer by.\nHaving been confined to seeing India from tuk-tuks for far too long,\nthe bird\u2019s eye view was welcome and\nwonderful. The location is perfect for\ncatching a mix of the busting city and\nthe calmer countryside, and against the\nemerald backdrop the roaming wildlife\nand glistening garments of village ladies looked stunning. I\u2019m sure colour\nis what I\u2019ll miss the most about India,\nand from the sky you can really see it\nall.\nBeing the first balloon of the season,\nwe attracted the attention of countless\nvillagers as we passed overhead; when\nthe pilot kindly dipped us closer to the\nground hoards of children chased and\nwaved at us with a morning \u201cnamaste!\u201d\nIt was also a great experience for us to\ncatch a glimpse of their morning rituals without being overly invasive.\nAfter we landed with a great thud\nvillagers ran over to greet us, and took\nmore photos of us than we did of them!\nCrew members spoke fluent English\nand Hindi so were able to mediate and\nmake the meeting a little more engag-ing: getting to mingle with the people\nwe\u2019d just seen from the sky was an enjoyable ending to a great morning es-capade. If you\u2019re going be sure to take\nplenty of pens, which are an invaluable\nresource to the children.\nAll in all, a fantastic and worthwhile\nway to catch Indian culture alongside\na terrific backdrop of dusty buildings\nand plush trees, with the usual docile\ncows in view to keep you entertained\nif all else fails. I only wish that I could\nsee more of this beautiful country from\nsuch great heights.\nWaves and gazes of awe as the balloon soars over rural villages\n\n"

Two Snow Whites. One fairytale. Within a short span of three months next year, we are incredibly un/fortunate (delete as appropriate), to have two\nfilms based on the popular story of Snow White. Mirror Mirror, out next March, takes a much lighter, colourful, and slap-stick approach, whereas Snow White\nand the Huntsman, released in June, as its title may suggest, has a more violent, sadistic, and dark spin to it. Much like this year\u2019s No Strings Attached and\nFriends with Benefits, there will be stiff competition to see which the better adaptation is. Trailers have recently been posted for both films, and it\u2019s time for\nFelix Film to predict which has the upper hand.\nJohn Park tries to determine who really will be the fairest of them all...\nThe Queen\nWhen the sinister, techno music starts setting the tone for Snow White and the\nHuntsman, chills are sent down one\u2019s spine as the devilishly sexy Charlize Theron\n(left) starts narrating. And she does this with a flawless English accent, something that gives her a more majestic, elegant presence. But don\u2019t be fooled by her\nbeauty: she is full of bitter resentment and hatred, as she quite literally sucks\nlife out of a beautiful maiden, murders someone in her bed, sports some nasty-looking claws, bathes in questionable white-looking liquid, and turns into crows.\nShe\u2019s clearly a nasty piece of work, and it\u2019s hard to imagine the queen not getting\nwhat she wants.\nJulia Roberts (right) on the other hand, might just deliver nothing short of a\nmajor flop of a performance, and that\u2019s just from watching the trailer. She\u2019s supposed to be a funnier evil queen, meaning whiny and immature, which is fine, if\nonly Roberts could speak any one of her lines with consistency. She goes for the\nEnglish accent. She fails. She retreats back into an odd hybrid of English and\nAmerican. Then she just gives up. She goes into full-blown American towards the\nend of the trailer. And this is in the space of two minutes. This does not bode well\nfor the entire film. Not everything is her fault though. Her evil Queen is too low-key\nand trivial to care about. All she wants is to marry the good-looking young prince\nto sort out her\u2026 um\u2026 financial troubles. This is an insult to the evil Queen, not\nto mention an unwise move to diminish a well-known character to mere caricature.\nThe Princess\nKristen Stewart (left) is harshly and unfairly criticised for everything she does\nbecause of that Twilight franchise. She has given good performances in the past,\nand it comes as good news that her usual blank, withdrawn expression is somewhat suitable for the role of a victim. A slight problem though; the trailer for Snow\nWhite and the Huntsman oddly sidelines her, so much so that she doesn\u2019t get the\nchance to utter a single syllable of her dialogue. The only unique aspect of her\ncharacter we find out is that this time, our fairytale princess is a fighter, dressed\nin armour, wielding a sword. Was her performance so bad that it had to be cut?\nLily Collins (right) of Mirror Mirror looks younger, more innocent and has fancier\ndresses as she dances away in her dizzyingly radioactive coloured palace. She\u2019s\nall smiles even when her queen banishes her into the woods, and she seems to\nspend some fun times with her new friendly dwarves. The twist here is that not\nonly must she master fencing to overthrow the woman responsible for her many\ntroubles, she must also fight for her love, as the queen is also pining away at the\ntall and handsome prince. Collins is certainly cute and lovable, more fitting for the\nkind of Snow White we are used to. Mirror Mirror is a more light-hearted adventure\nfilm, and Collins is suitably fitting for the lead role.\nThe Prince\nSwinging an axe is not very different from swinging a hammer, which is why Chris\n\u201cThor\u201d Hemsworth (left) is perfectly suited for the Huntsman opposite Stewart.\nHis rugged physique and scruffy features firmly establish that he\u2019s a tough man\nof the wild. He even has the guts to ask \u201cWhy is she of such value?\u201d to the scary\nTheron when she dispatches him to hunt down Snow White. What a lad.\nThe Social Network\u2019s Armie Hammer (right) steals the hearts of not only Snow\nWhite, but also the queen in Mirror Mirror. Hammer is a talented enough actor to\nfully embrace the humourous side of his character, with his playful attitude looking as though there could be convincing chemistry between him and Collins. There\nis one very disturbing scene though: Hammer is given a \u201clove potion\u201d by the evil\nqueen, as she tries to use magic for his love. It turns out the potion is labelled\n\u201cpuppy love.\u201d The result? Hammer starts acting like a puppy. He asks the queen\nto \u201crub [his] belly.\u201d Creepy\u2026\nVerdict: At this point, I\u2019m leaning towards Snow White and the Huntsman, purely because of Theron\u2019s spot-on portrayal of the antagonist.\n\n"

You\u2019ve\ngot nothing on Creatures!\nPhilip Kent puts aside the big releases of this season and talks about one of video gaming\u2019s grandaddies, Creatures\nW\nith blockbusters such as Skyrim being released, and modern legends like Minecraft\ncelebrating its birthday, it is\noften possible to overlook\nsome real masterpieces. One of these is Creatures, and the sad thing is that many of you will\nprobably have never heard of it!\nCreatures is the brainchild of Steve Grand\nOBE, an \u2018independent scientist\u2019 who focuses his\nresearch on artificial life. It is this research that\nlead onto Creatures; one of the first games to\nsimulate artificial life down to its neurological\nand biological underpinnings.\nOne of the most appealing things about Creatures is the fact that, whilst incredibly complex\nand even scientifically accurate (insofar as it was\npossible to back in 1997 \u2013 computing power\nhas come a long way!),\nit was still incredibly\nfun, and even emotion-al! Many a player had to\nhold back a tear when one\nof the Norns (one of the species in the game) more dear to\nthem decided that it would quite\nlike to give suicide a try. Indeed,\nthe publisher (Mindscape \u2013 remember them?) even printed the tagline\n\u201cThey\u2019ll make you laugh. They\u2019ll\nmake you cry. They\u2019ll make you think.\u201d\nThose with a bit more of a scientific\ninclination can always fire up the Science Kit or (in later versions) the Neuroscience Kit for some (potentially lethal)\ntinkering \u2013 it\u2019s possible to probe brain\ncells, examine organ status or even\n\u201cWhilst the series is still\navailable to purchase,\nthe current owners\nappear to be sitting on\nan unsung hero of British\nengineering.\u201d\ninject a cocktail of chemical mixtures. In later\nversions, the ability to inject specific chemicals\nwas added and, as attempted to follow reality as\nclosely as possible, you could inject some ATP to\ngive your Norn a much-needed kick, or if you\u2019re\nslightly masochistic, you\ncan even pump your\ncreature\u2019s blood vessels\nfull of cyanide. Followed\nby sodium thiosulphate, of\ncourse \u2013 I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not\na murderer!\nAnother example of the technical excellence behind the\ngame is the Genetics Kit. When\nyou got bored with natural selection killing off the weaker crea-tures, you can simply fire up the\nkit and tinker to your heart\u2019s content\nto produce the genetic sequence of\nyour dreams. Ageing can be disabled,\nimmunity to poisons added; most of\nthe flexibility of real-life genetics is\navailable at your disposal \u2013 meaning that you can go wrong and end\n\u201cCreatures; one of the\nfirst games to simulate\nartificial life down to its\nneurological and biological\nunderpinnings\u201d\nup with a stillborn more often than not! And I\nhaven\u2019t even got space to mention CAOS!\nHumble Bundle brings\nthe DRM-free deals\nNever heard of the Humble Bundle? Shame on\nyou! The pay-what-you-want-for-a-selection-of\ngreat-games (completely DRM free!) scheme?\nDid I mention that all the games are available on\nWindows, Mac and Linux systems? No? Well I\njust did!\nDid I also happen to bring up the fact that you\ndecide how your money is split, divided between\nthe game\u2019s developers, two registered charities (the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the\nChild\u2019s Play Charity) and the Humble Bundle\nsite\u2019s running costs? Well Mister (or Ma\u2019am),\nyou\u2019ve just been re-educated.\nSeriously though, the Humble Bundle deals\n(The Humble Introversion Bundle this time\naround) are a good deal for both you, the developers and the charities. The game selection includes\na few small, award-winning games such as DEFLaurence Pope\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation and the\nChild\u2019s Play Charity are the two charities the\nHB supports\nCON and Aquaria, and for amount of money you\ncan potentially shell out it\u2019s a bloody good deal.\nJust don\u2019t be a stingy bastard!\nActivision shuns free\nadvertisement\nLaurence Pope\nActivision you muppets. What on Earth are you\non?\nFor no apparent reason this week Activision re-quested, i.e. demanded, that the YouTube video\nseries Weapon Guide Express, for the Call of Duty\nseries, be taken down.\nOK, I lied, there is a motive for their actions. The\nguy\u2019s videos were so good that Activision hired\nhim to make channels for Elite TV, a section of\nCall of Duty Elite, a premium service offered by\nActivision. Being of sound mind the guy accepted,\nbut also continued on a smaller, free series on YouTube for his fans. That is, until Activision pulled\nthat particular plug, meaning the only way people\ncan see his stuff now is to pay.\nIt\u2019s well known thatAcivision loves money in the\nsame way we need oxygen, but seriously? Are they\nso blinded that they can\u2019t see the huge potential in\nYour guess is as good as mine folks\nfree YouTube advertising? The guy had 160,000+\nsubscribers. That\u2019s a lot of potential customers. A\nlot of potential sales.\nIs this going to be a future trend for Activision?\nWho knows. Let\u2019s hope not.\nIt is quite sad that, whilst the series is still\navailable to purchase, the current owners appears to be sitting around on what is an unsung\nhero of British engineering. So while we wait\nfor Grand\u2019s next A-Life game (Grandroids), I do\nhope that new people can experience the joy to\nbe had from the fun, yet realistic world of Creatures.\n\n"

    "content": "L\nast Thursday the Government announced that Northern Rock was to\nbe bought by Virgin Money. Northern Rock was famously nationalised\nin February 2008 as the Credit\nCrunch took its first victim this side of the Atlantic. The deal that has just been negotiated says\nthat Virgin will pay \u00a3747m upfront with approximately another \u00a3250m in further possible pay-ments, valuing the deal at about \u00a31 billion. This is\nwell short of the \u00a31.4 billion of taxpayers\u2019money\nit cost to keep the bank afloat, so even though\non the face of it a \u00a3400m loss (about 28%) looks\nterrible, it may still represent a good deal for us.\n\u201cThe Northern Rock sold\nlast Thursday is not the\nsame Northern Rock that\nwas bought in 2008\u201d\nEd Balls, the shadow chancellor, expressed the\nview \u201c[Northern Rock plc] is being sold off at a\nloss, and I think there is a question as to whether\nor not this is the best time, with the markets in\nturmoil, to get the best deal. George Osborne will\nneed to explain that\u201d. The response from George\nOsborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer, was to\nreveal that the deal that nationalised Northern\nRock contained a clause stating the bank had to\nbe privatised by 2013, hence the timing of the\nsale \u2013 and the consequent loss \u2013 might be somewhat justified.\nRegarding market turmoil, with the exception\nof the sovereign bond market, the stock exchange\nBUSINESS\nFELIX\nBusiness Editors: Be\u00f1at Gurrutxaga-Lerma\nNina Kearsey\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 25 november 2011\nseems to have done reasonably well in the last\nyear; however, bank shares specifically plummeted with the crisis, posing the question of just\nhow long could the state hold on to Northern\nRock? Its nationalisation was always supposed to\nbe a temporary one, with pledges being made that\nit would be sold as soon as possible. The problem\nis, the markets (especially banks) do not look like\nthey are going to get much better any time soon,\nespecially not by 2013. Banking stocks have fallen dramatically over the past 5 years (Barclays:\n\u201375%, Lloyds: \u201395%, RBS: \u201396%, HSBC:\n\u201350%), and have all remained pretty much flat\nfor the last three, with perhaps a slight further decrease in value. If banks are losing value, it could\nbe argued there is no point in waiting any longer.\nLastly the Northern Rock sold last Thursday\nis not the same Northern Rock that was bought\nin 2008. The bank currently has just 45% of the\nstaff on its books as it did when nationalised. It\nhas been gutted of all the risky parts of the busi-ness, and now has a more stable financial structure meaning it is actually quite a good bank. In\nterms of its loan to deposit ratio (now standing\nat 73%) it holds more in deposits than it lends\nout in loans, making it a safe bank. Also banks\nare almost never sold at 100% of their held asset\nvalues, there is always some discount.\n\u201cIf banks are losing value\n... there is no point in\nwaiting any longer\u201d\nWith banks losing value there is no guarantee\nthat waiting until 2013 would have helped the\nNorthern Rock situation, and at least now there\nis someone willing to buy. The most important\nthing this deal will achieve is competition. Virgin Money has always wanted to buy Northern\nRock \u2013 in 2008 they made an offer for a 30%\nstake in the bank that was ultimately unsuccess-ful. They seem to have the ambition to expand\nthe bank onto more high streets and try and break\nthe stranglehold of Barclays, RBS, Lloyds and\nHSBC, and that can only be a good thing. Perhaps if Virgin can make a success of the bank,\nthe additional \u00a3400m could be earned back in the\nform of taxes. If this means a better service and\nbetter products for customers going to the Bank,\nthey should be pretty happy.\n14\nNorthern Rock was bailed out by the Bank of\nEngland in late 2007 following the US subprime-mortgage crisis that was the spark to the recent\nglobal recession. The news became awash with\neconomic and financial terminology, and in a cover\nof the Northern Rock story The Spectator\u2019s Allister Heath turned his attention to the BBC\u2019s invocation of the term \u2018moral hazard.\u2019\n\u201cJolted out of prosperous complacency by market turmoil,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe public has started to\ncare about economics: strange jargon and obscure concepts previously familiar only to investment bankers are going mainstream.\u201d Continuing\nthe article, Heath moves on to say how moral hazard \u2013 the risk which arises when a party is spared\nfrom the full consequences of their actions \u2013 is a\nlesson that needs to be \u2018hard-learned\u2019; that the\ngovernment ought to guarantee only the extent of\ninvestors\u2019 deposits required by law, rather than\nthe entire sum. This, he argued, would be the way\nto force depositors to check on the creditworthi-ness of thier banks.\nHeath\u2019s rationalisation of incomplete bailouts\nraises the important question of accountabil-ity, especially with regard to the investing public,\nbut it seems perhaps too high a price to pay for\nwhat amounts to the encouragement of education\nand foresight in investors. And indeed we may\ngo some way towards this aim by sticking to his\nopening premise: the importance of clarity from\nthe media in demystifying the jargon describing\nwhat lead us into our present situation, and what\nwill lead us out of it.\n\u2013 The Business Editors\nLetter from the Editors The Virgin of the Rock*\nBusiness magnate Richard Branson holds up a Virgin Money credit card, presumably\nwith a gargantuan credit limit; he is the UK\u2019s 4th richest man, after all\nRajvinder Virdee comments on some of the political and social ramifications of the sale of Northern Rock plc to Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Money\nThe infamous Northern Rock received its notoriety in 2007 when it became the first\nbank in 150 years to suffer a bank run after having to approach the BoE for a loan\n*After coining this headline the Business\nEditors became aware that a BBC article by\nRobert Peston was recently published under the same title, however having thought\nof it independently from Peston, and feeling rather pleased with themselves for this\nbout of creativity, they have decided to go\nahead with it anyway.\n\n"

We've all\nplayed games that we are unable to put down, and the responsibility comes down to\nothers to crowbar the controller \u2013 or mouse and keyboard if you're so inclined\n\u2013 out of our hands. We've all got up early before\nschool to spend a few golden hours with our lat-est, engrossing purchase. We've all daydreamed\nin lectures about how we can't wait to get home to\ncomplete our diamond mine in Minecraft, to rack\nup those head-shots on Team Fortress 2, or get\nthrough that edge of the seat relegation battle in\nFootball Manager. Some people may have even\nmissed said lectures to do just these things, although they'd never admit to it in public, let alone\nin a student newspaper.\nWhy exactly do we do this? What is it that\ngives us that insatiable appetite to keep playing\nand playing, even when we know we have much\nmore important things to do? Well, scientists this\nweek have come up with an answer. It turns out\nthat gamers are different in more ways than just\nthe obvious, potentially socially embarrassing\nones; our brains are structurally different. And as\nit turns out, we're all addicts.\nThe study I'm referring to isn't one of those\nunreliable, waste-of-time-and-energy studies on\nvideo games which only gets enough respect to\nfeature in the middle pages of The Sun (or the\nfront page of the Daily Mail). In fact, this study\nwas published in Nature's Translational Psychiatry journal, and looks like it could be the real deal.\n(Warning: neuroscience ahead.) Essentially, the\nstudy has found that frequent gaming is associated with higher levels of grey matter in the do-pamine-related ventral striatum. This area of the\nbrain forms an integral part of our internal reward\nsystem and has been shown to be closely related\nto addiction on many separate occasions. Additionally, the study showed that this increase in\ngrey matter correlated with less deliberation time\nwhen making decisions during a gambling task\nand more loss-related activity during a monetary\nincentive delay task.\nSo what can we glean from this? Well, if we\nwere being reactionary we might say that playing\nvideo games causes our brains to swell, encourages us to make rash decisions and forces us to\ncontinually carry out tasks which we are doomed\nto fail, with no thought of nobly accepting defeat.\nHowever, the study provides, oh so predictably,\nno evidence that playing video games causes any\nof the features that I have already described. In\nfact, it seems logical to me that the reverse is\nmuch more likely to be true: people with brains\nthat predispose them to addiction, with more grey\nmatter in their ventral striatum, are more likely\nto engage in potentially addictive activities, and\nI am placing video games firmly in this category.\nIndeed, it was Henrietta Bowden-Jones from our\nvery own Neuroscience division that suggested\nthat the findings \"further close the gap\" between\nvideo gaming and other addictions. The idea that\npeople whose brains predispose them to addiction\nare more inclined to play video games is something that I wish to use as a base for a potentially\ncontroversial observation that I can't help but\nmake: video games are a lot like drugs.\nI'd like to introduce this idea with a joke:\n\u201cFrequent gaming is\nassociated with higher\nlevels of grey matter in the\ndopamine-related ventral\nstratum\u201d\n\u201cThis study was published\nin Nature\u2019s Translational\nPsychiatry journal, and\nlooks like it could be the\nreal deal\u201d\nWhat's the difference between a drug addict and\na gamer? One parts with a lot of their hard earned\ncash in order to achieve short term pleasure \u2013 the\nother is a drug addict. Video games, like drugs,\nsatisfy our brains in ways which keep drawing us\nback to them. We cannot get enough. As you start\nto accept this fact, yet more similarities will open\nup. For example, it is a well known fact that the\nmore drugs you take, the more you need to take\nto achieve that elusive high. Tell me, can you remember a game that was as magical during your\nfirst playthrough as it was during your tenth? If\nyou can, then I'll certainly have whatever you're\nhaving.\nAnother similarity can be drawn between the\ncorresponding suppliers in each cases: the drug\ndealers and the video game companies. Now I'm\nnot particularly familiar with the way in which a\ndrug organisation starts up, and what understanding I do have is drawn from the questionable realism of The Wire (which I would recommend to\neveryone, by the way). I would hasten to guess\nthat this first step requires that you produce a better product than your rivals. Once you have this\nproduct you will gradually get more and more\ncustomers, utilising economies of scale, and before you know it you're sitting on a mountain of\ncash. When you get to this stage you can start to\nrelax. From then on, to some extent, you can get\nby on your name alone. Your business model becomes more about exploiting the irrational minds\nof those who are so hell-bent on buying from you\nthan about creating a quality product.\n\u201cVideo games, like drugs,\nsatisfy our brains in ways\nwhich keep drawing us\nback. We cannot get\nenough\u201d\nWith this in mind, let's examine a random gaming franchise. Say, I don't know, Call of Duty.\nFor me, this is a series that started of with real\npromise. The franchise was built up by Activision, alongside developers, with real quality at its\ncore, and managed to better (or at least match) its\nrivals in its early days. It gradually attracted more\nand more customers, utilising economies of scale,\nand before you know it, Activision was sitting on\na mountain of cash. You see where I'm going with\nthis. And by the way, the same could be said for a\nwhole lot of other video game producers.\nSo, what does this all mean? Should we all start\nchecking ourselves into rehab? Well, no, not re-ally. Because video games aren't like hard drugs.\nBut for a few, World of Warcraft related cases,\nyou won't die because of video game addiction in\nthe same way that you are likely to if heroin or cocaine is your poison of choice. No, video games\nare more like marijuana \u2013 practically harmless\nsubstances (check the studies if you don't believe\nme) that will let you sink into your own little\nworld of bliss. From what I hear anyway. I can\nhonestly say that I have never smoked marijuana\nin my life. If I had, however, I imagine that it\nwould be a lot like slipping through a green pipe\ninto Super Mario World for a brief period of time.\nDOI: 10.1038/tp.2011.53\n\n"

Up until\nthe early part of the last decade,\nthat was Class B, which comes\nwith a maximum 5 year jail term\nfor possession and 14 years for\nsupply and trafficking. However\nin an attempt to free up police\ntime the government announced\nthe reclassification of cannabis\nto a Class C drug. According to\nsome reports, 190,000 police\nhours were saved the following\nyear because of the reclassifica-tion. What didn\u2019t happen, though,\nwas the complete or even partial\nlegalisation of Cannabis.\nThe story resumes with Jacqui\nSmith, who announced that weed\nwas to be reclassified back up to\nClass B in 2005. This was amusing in a not particularly funny way\nbecause it was completely and\nutterly contrary to what the Advisory Council on the Misuse of\nDrugs recommended. Scientists\nresigned but the reclassification\ncarried on as declared. Amsterdam is notorious in the tourist industry as the city where you can\neasily obtain cannabis. Special\n\u2018coffee shops\u2019 are open with their\ndrug policy, selling items such\nas cannabis-cakes and general\nmarijuana. In previous years, the\nDutch regulations were divided\nbetween \u2018hard\u2019 drugs and \u2018soft\u2019\ndrugs, where cannabis is classed\nas a soft drug. The policy on soft\ndrugs is simply that they can be\ntaken under \u2018personal use\u2019 so\nthat even smoking weed in public is legal. Dutch drug policy is\nunique as it is centred on the\nidea that every human being may\ndecide about the matters of its\nown health.\nUnlucky for some, earlier this\nyear it was announced that there\nwill be a change in drug regulations in the Netherlands. The\nDutch government decided that\nby the end of 2011, the infamous\ncannabis coffee shops will no\nlonger be open to tourists. Instead they will only be open to\nDutch citizens where each coffee shop will act as a private\nclub of around 1,500 members.\nDutch citizens will need to obtain\na membership for a coffee shop\nin order to use it. Additionally,\nsome coffee shops have been\nforced to close due to their proximity to schools.\nMatt Allinson and Aemun Reza\nBaroness Eliza Manningham\nBuller is not the only person connected with Imperial to voice concerns about the \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d.\nProfessor David J Nutt, who holds\nthe Edmond J Safra Chair in Neuropsychopharmacology has long\nbeen an outspoken critic of British drug policy. Last week he\njoined Baroness Manningham\nBuller and other major public\nfigures, including Jimmy Carter\nand Lech Wa\u0142esa, in publishing a\npublic letter, which appeared as\na full length advertisement in the\nnational papers, entitled \u201cThe\nGlobal War on Drugs has Failed,\nIt is Time for a New Approach\u201d. In\nthe letter, they urge governments\nto \u201cconsider shifting resources\naway from criminalising tens of\nmillions of otherwise law abiding\ncitizens, and move towards an\napproach based on health, harm-reduction, cost-effectiveness\nand respect for human rights\u201d.\nLast year Nutt co-authored a\npaper in The Lancet which suggested that, taking into account\nthe harm done to both users and\nothers, alcohol was more dangerous than heroin. The paper also\nclaimed that \u201cpresent drug classification systems have little relation to the evidence of harm\u201d.\nOf course, Nutt is best known\nby the general public for having\nbeen removed from his post as\nthe head of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs after\nspeaking out against the government\u2019s decision to ignore official\nadvice and reclassify cannabis\nfrom Class B to Class C. Alan\nJohnson, the then Home Secretary, wrote to Nutt, saying that he\ncould not \u201chave public confusion\nbetween scientific advice and\npolicy\u201d. Shortly after the incident,\nhowever, the Guardian reported\nNutt saying: \u201cAll I was trying to do\nwas help. I wasn\u2019t challenging the\ngovernment. We can help them.\nWe can give them very good ad-vice, and it would be much more\nsimpler [sic] if they took that advice rather than getting tangled\nup in other sorts of messages\nwhich frankly really do confuse\nthe public.\u201d\nMaciej Matuszewski\nThe History of Legalisation David Nutt advocates new approach\nber of the Centre for Social Justice. In\nthe speech, she was quoted as saying,\n\u201cWhat I said [about knee-jerk opposition to any change] has been proved\nright.\u201d\n\u201cThose politicians and commentators who may recognise, at the very\nleast, that there are serious questions\nabout the efficacy of current policies,\ngo quiet or retract when faced by the\ncrude assertion that any other policy\nwould do corrosive and irreparable\nharm.\u201d\nPrime Minister David Cameron,\nonce member of a Home Affairs Select Committee in May 2002, was\nonce quoted in the full report, which\nexamined the Government\u2019s Drugs\nPolicy at the time: \u201cDrugs policy in\nthis country has been failing for decades.\u201d\nThe report continued: \u201cI hope that\nour report will encourage fresh thinking and a new approach. We need to\nget away from entrenched positions\nand try to reduce the harm that drugs\ndo both to users and society at large.\u201d\nIn her speech, Eliza acknowledged\nthat \u201cI don\u2019t pretend there are easy\noptions as this is a complex problem.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to collect information on\nwhat works, on how harm can be reduced and on what is cost-effective.\u201d\nEliza took on her current role as\nCouncil Chairman on July 16 this\nyear following on from her role as\nDeputy Chairman since 2009.\nEditorial: Page 16\n\u201cGiven its effect on\nus all ...

Open\nfrom last Friday 3 January, the stunning bar\nand restaurant is the only fully heated place\nwithin Winter Wonderland. Going back to the\nearly 19th century, Spiegel Tents were travelling ballrooms and entertainment salons, originating in Belgium. Spiegel Saloon maintains\nthis charming aura of tradition; the bar is spacious \u2013 the saloon seats up to 200 visitors \u2013 and\nthe comfy sofas and beanbags contribute to a\nwarm welcoming.\nIf you\u2019re up for just a quick drink or seeking a place to dine, Spiegel Saloon is the perfect place in Winter Wonderland. Choice in\ndrinks is wide; Spiced Hot Farmhouse Cider,\nHot Toddy, and Mulled Wine are all great,\nespecially if winter flu has knocked on your\ndoor and coursework deadlines are all over the\nplace. Foodwise, Spiegel Saloon offers a Prix\nFixe menu, with two courses for \u00a314.95 and\nthree courses on offer for \u00a319.45. The selec-Young science students from Sherborne Girls in\nDorset have discovered what makes the perfect\nboiled egg and soldiers. In an \u201cEggsperiment\u201d\ncommissioned by the Royal Society of Chemistry,\na team of 12 girls tested one of Britain\u2019s favourite\nbreakfasts and confirmed the optimum time for\nboiling an egg, as well as the key variables that\nmake up the perfect dipping soldier.\nStella Botes, a 13-year-old student, told me that\n\u201cThe inspiration for the \u2018eggsperiment\u2019 was to\nperfect something that everyone does at home,\nusing science. My particular group were working\non the runniness of yolk and flexibility of bread.\nThe conclusions of the data were that margarine\nmakes a stronger soldier than butter, white bread\nmakes more effective dunking soldiers, the optimum toasting time is 2.5 minutes, the perfect soldier dimension is 1.5cm in width, and the perfect\nboiled egg takes six minutes.\u201d\nIram Hasan, who is a 17 year old student, con-fesses, \u201cI believe that gastronomy is inevitably\ndefined by taste and a person\u2019s own preferences.\nThe perfect boiled egg and soldiers might not be\nthe perfect boiled egg and soldiers for another\nperson. However, scientific food experiments can\nhelp give a more objective overview of food; reducing biased and subjective results which can lead\nto inaccuracy. Heston Blumenthal highlights that\nscientific food experiments can add to gastrono-my, and as scientists, we are always looking for\nthe reason behind observations, even in food! Science can make food even more exciting, as Heston does so well.\u201d\nScience is everywhere. And as a scientist you\nmust be able to cook a proper breakfast!\nAnastasia Eleftheriou\nThe young food scientists are happy to answer any\nmore questions you might have about the experiment at office@sherborne.com.\nFood Experiments\ntion ranges from seasonal dishes, such as The\nSpiegel Christmas Plate to firm favourites such\nas Bangers and Mash. The food will not be the\nbest you\u2019ve ever had, but looking at the price\ntogether with the Christmassy atmosphere, it\nis the best for those who need refuelling after\na fun time on the Winter Wonderland rides.\nDesserts are nothing less than fulfilling; my\nsuggestion would be the Chocolate Soup Platter for two, a warm bowl of melted chocolate\nIngredients\nFor the stuffed vine leaves:\n1 cup rice Arborio\n3 carrots\n1 medium onion chopped\n1 tsp chopped garlic\n2 tsp dried basil\n1 tsp dried mint\n1 tsp oregano\n1 tbsp olive oil\nJuice from 1 lemon\n500g vine leaves\nSalt and black pepper to taste\nFor the Pourgouri:\n1 small onion chopped\n\u00bd cup chopped tomatoes\n\u00bd cup bulgur wheat\n\u00bc cup cut vermicellini(pasta)\n3 tbsp olive oil\nSalt and black pepper to taste\nMethod\nFor the stuffed vine leaves:\nFirst make the stuffing. In a bowl mix the\nrice, the chopped carrots and onion, the\ngarlic, the basil, the mint, the oregano,\nthe lemon juice, the olive oil, and the salt\nand pepper.\nThen, take one vine leaf at a time and\nplace it in a plate. Put 1 tsp (depending\non the size of the leaves) of the stuffing\nin the centre of the leaf. Fold the sides of\nthe leaf towards the centre and then roll\nit. After you fold each vine leaf, place it\nin a pot. When you finish, cover the vine\nleaves with water and add 1 tbsp of olive\noil. Place a plate on top of them, so that\nthey will keep their shape while they are\nboiling. Put it on low heat.\nFor the Pourgouri:\nPut the olive oil in a pot and add the\nchopped onions. When they begin to take\na light golden colour add the vermicellini.\nFry them until they become brown. Add\nthe tomatoes and the bulgur wheat and\nthen add water so that the bulgur wheat\nis fully covered. Add the salt and pepper.\nPlace it on medium heat and stir every 5\nminutes. When there is no water in the\npot, reduce the heat to low until it becomes dry. Then remove from the heat.\nYiango Mavrocostanti\nRecipe: Stuffed Vine Leaves and Pourgouri\nI know you\u2019ve had it with eggscruciating yolks\nMichael Krestas\nserved with marshmallows, strawberries, prof-iteroles, and waffles \u2013 the perfect chocolate experience for the cold nights to come.\nFinally, what would a saloon be without\nlive music and entertainment? Certainly, it\nwouldn\u2019t be a saloon at all.

Speaking at\na meeting held by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Drug Policy\nReform, the ex-Director General of\nMI5 and crossbench life peer raised\npotential points of consideration in a\nspeech, including regulation of cannabis and a focus on drugs as an issue\nof health rather than of crime.\nStating her awareness that the issue is a \u201cminefield\u201d and that potential\nmisrepresentation by the media was\nlikely, Eliza acknowledged that drug\npolicy is a \u201ctaboo subject for discussion\u201d, while criticising \u201cknee-jerk reaction to any change\u201d.

Wait, what?\nDwarf Fortress: challenging, captivating, and almost completely unheard of.\nKeir Little sheds some light on this hidden gem\n\u201cThe game world is larger\nthan you could ever hope\nto explore; each town has\nlimitless random quests\u201d\nD\neep underground, a lonely dwarf\nminer breaks into an expansive\ncavern. As he stumbles out into the\ndarkness, two trolls immediately set\nupon him. \u201cBugger,\u201d I say, pausing\nthe game to take a sip of tea, and plan best how\nto save him. I order my soldiers to go down and\njoin the fight. Meanwhile, my carpenter, desperately waiting months for the turtle shell she desires\nto finish her project, finally snaps. After chopping\nher own baby\u2019s head off, she runs around in a\nrage, butchering my fort\u2019s other inhabitants, while\nmy soldiers are deep in the caverns fighting other\nthreats.\nThere are no reloads in this game: I abandon\nmy fort, and start again. After a few hours, goblins attack much sooner than expected. I hurry my\ndwarves inside to safety, but my beloved mayor is\ncaught and killed. The other dwarves, mourning\nhis loss, become depressed, throwing themselves\noff cliffs or refusing to eat until they die. I quit, get\nanother cup of tea, and start again. I accidentally\nflood my fort with lava. Quit, start again. I embark\nupon an area so frozen, no water flows, and my\ndwarves dehydrate. I quit, ready to start again before I realise that I\u2019m meant to be writing an article\non Dwarf Fortress, not just playing it.\n\u201cLosing is fun!\u201d is the unofficial motto of the\ngame, and for good reason: every playthrough ends\nin the eventual demise of your fortress. How long\nyou wait for that moment is a matter of experience\nand a lot of luck. There\u2019s a lot that can go wrong,\nfrom the mundane (starvation, freezing, flood-ing) to the insane, (dragon attack, magma, murder\nsprees). Dwarf Fortress makes no pretence at being easy. In the indie gaming community, it\u2019s re-vered: heard of by many, its influence felt in countless games (most notably Minecraft), but played\nonly by a hardcore few.\nIt\u2019s not all doom and gloom. Once you\u2019ve got\na hang of the basics, and can expect your fort to\nlast for a reasonable length of time, DF becomes\na game of opportunity, complexity and challenge.\nSkyrim may be \u201cstaggeringly ambitious,\u201d but it\u2019s\nBlackpool Tower compared to the Burj Khalifa\nheights of ambition reached by Dwarf Fortress.\nRecreate your greatest Minecraft city for your\ndwarves to live in, pump magma to the surface\nto boil goblins alive, arm your soldiers with steel\nplate, encrusted with jewels and all engraved with\ndepictions of their victories. What you can do is\nnear-limitless and equaling each other only in their\ndifficulty.\nOh yes, even when things are going perfectly,\nthis game is hard. Without graphics to hinder your\nimagination, you\u2019re left with ASCII characters.\nLike looking at the Matrix, it\u2019s bewildering until\nyour mind begins to fill in the gaps. There\u2019s no\nmouse control \u2013 the interface is a series of key-strokes, with the in-game menus being inconsistent\nand little help. Of course, it\u2019s still in development,\nbut the game\u2019s sole programmer would rather work\non new features than on optimisation. \u201cThe interface is coming \u2013 it's not coming in your lifetime,\nbut it's coming,\u201d he says. The players prefer it this\nway.\nHaving been in alpha release for over five years\nnow, the game has built up a diehard fandom. The\ncommunity is tight-knit, but welcoming, which is\nfortunate: without careful guidance from veterans,\nalmost all new players would run away screaming.\nMost still do. The fan-made wiki is so comprehensive that even the developers refer to it, and the forums are a friendly place where noobs are encouraged to ask questions. The community are part of\nwhat makes the game such a living, evolving thing:\nsharing their creations, reporting bugs, suggesting\nand commenting on new features.\nThe game is the brainchild of two people: brothers Tarn and Zach Adams, more commonly known\nas ToadyOne and ThreeToe. Toady has a PhD in\nmaths from Stanford, but currently works full-time\nprogramming Dwarf Fortress, living off savings\nand donations from grateful players. He has no\ncurrent plans to charge for the game, and with its\nalmost complete lack of graphics and notorious interface problems, it\u2019ll never gain the mainstream\nattention or revenue attained by more user-friendly\nindie games.\nPart of the reason for its difficulty is that the\ngame, fully titled \u2018Slaves to Armok: God of Blood,\nChapter II: Dwarf Fortress\u2019, shares many similarities with its predecessor, the original Slaves to\nArmok. Known as \u201croguelikes,\u201d it and others like\nit were a genre of dungeon-crawling RPGs famed\nfor having permanent character deaths, and a myrid\nof things which could kill or harm your character.\nDF takes more than just the ASCII graphics\nfrom this genre. Its adventure mode pays homage\nto roguelikes, and unlike the fortress mode lets\nyou control a single character. The game world is\nrandomly generated; unconstrained by graphics, it\ndetails the lives of hundreds of thousands of inhabitants in text. It\u2019s larger than you could ever hope\nto fully explore; each town has limitless random\nquests.

From NATO to the Warsaw\npact, these alliances have changed our\nworld, for better or worse. But even as\nNATO warplanes fly over Libya and\nthe Arab League rails against Syria, the\nstrongest and most enduring of these\nalliances has no formal founding docu-ments, no official meeting chambers\nand no flashy logo. The so-called \u201cSpecial Relationship\u201d between Britain and\nthe United States may well be the most\nimportant alliance of our time and this\nWednesday marked the 200th birthday\nof the man who, in a very real sense,\nput this alliance in motion.\nJohn Bright was born on the 18th of\nNovember 1811 into a very different\ncross Atlantic relationship to today\u2019s.\nAmerica as a colony was still in living\nmemory on both sides of the pond and\ntension abounded: Bright was just three\nyears old when the British Navy sailed\ninto Washington DC and burnt down\nthe White House. So when the American Civil War broke out in 1861, it was\nfar from obvious that the British should\nside with the Union.\nAs the Civil War unfolded, Britain\ninsisted on maintaining neutrality but\nmany in the country were openly pro-Confederate. Incredibly, the City of\nLondon raised \u00a317m to support the\nSouthern war effort \u2013 a huge sum in\ntoday\u2019s money. The Confederacy even\nbought battle ships from British com-panies. Indeed, when the Union cap- tured a Royal Mail ship containing\nConfederate diplomats, the UK threatened the Union with all our war unless\nthey released the men. They duly com-plied.\nJohn Bright, MP for Birmingham at\nthe time, was noted for being a radical\nliberaliser in Parliament in his support\nof extended franchise and repealing\nthe infamous Corn Laws. Importantly,\nhe was also horrified at the continued\nexistence of slavery in the southern\nAmerican states, which is what led him\nto seek his country\u2019s support for Lincoln\u2019s efforts against the Confederates.\nThis was despite his family owning a\ncotton mill in the south of the USA,\nwhich was sure to lose out should the\nUnion win the war. All the while, the\nUK was edging towards the Confederates, believing free trade to be more\nimportant. It was Bright\u2019s oratorical\nskills and commitment that persuaded\nthe then Prime Minister Palmerston to\nmaintain neutrality.\nIt was as a result of Bright\u2019s support for the Union that a strong friendship developed between Lincoln and\nBright, despite the two never meeting\nin person. In Lincoln\u2019s office hung two\nportraits \u2013 one of his predecessors, the\nother of John Bright. When he was\nshot dead, one of Bright\u2019s pro-Union\nspeeches from a year before was found\nin Lincoln\u2019s pocket.\nA lone pro-Union voice in a parliament and government split between\nneutrality and pro-Confederate military intervention, John Bright\u2019s efforts\nchanged the tide of Anglo-American\nrelations for good. Had the UK recognised the Confederacy, the world today\nwould be a very different place indeed.\nThe seeds of an alliance were sown\nby this man, 200 years old last week,\nwhich for better or worse matter more\nthan any other today.\nWho is Silvio? What is he,\nThat all our swines commend him?\nWholly full of vice is he;\nThe seven such place did lend him,\nThat he might removed be.\nIs he blind to his hair?\nFor arrogance lives with blindness.\nSloth doth to his mind repair,\nTo help him of his spineless,\nAnd being helped, inhabits there.\nThen to Silvio let us sing,\nThat Silvio is expelling;\nHe excels each immoral thing\nUpon the good earth dwelling:\nTo him let his bungas swing.\nJohn Hilliard (IC 1974-78)\nWho is Silvio?\nBenjamin Lindsey\n\u201cHad the UK recognised the Confederacy, the world today\nwould be a very different place indeed.\u201d\nOn 10 November 2010 a protest camp in the\nWestern Sahara was brutally dismantled by the\nMoroccan Government, representing the start\nof the real Arab Spring. One year on, despite\nhuge media coverage of the Arab Spring, almost no attention has been given to the Western\nSahara and its thirty-six year illegal occupation.\nPreviously a Spanish Colony, the Western\nSahara is a country in the North of Africa bordered by Morocco, Algeria and Mauritania.\nWhen the Spanish withdrew in 1975 the country was invaded by Morocco and Mauritania.\nThe International Court of Justice rejected the\nsovereignty claim of these two countries. Mauritania later withdrew from the Western Sahara\nbut Morocco has remained ever since. Over\nthirty-five years later, the country is split in two\nby a 1,500 mile wall, and over 100,000 of its\ncitizens are living as refugees in Algeria.\nThe United Nations has been active in the\ncountry since 1991, attempting to hold a referendum of Saharawi self-determination. Although there is a large body of evidence showing human rights violations from organisations\nsuch as Human Rights Watch, the UN mission\nhas no mandate to monitor human rights. This\nis the only UN peace- keeping mission for over\n20 years that has had no mechanism by which\nto monitor human rights. An appeal to extend\nthe UN mandate to allow such monitoring has\nbeen put forward to the UN Security Council\nmultiple times; each time it has been vetoed by\nFrance.\nPrior to the uprising in Tunisia in December of last year, the Saharawi people formed\na camp protesting against ongoing discrimina-tion, poverty and human rights abuses, as well\nas a call for Western Saharan independence.\nNoam Chomsky has stated that this protest\ncamp marked the start of the Arab Spring. The\nmonth long peaceful protest was eventually\ndismantled by Moroccan police, resulting in\nmultiple deaths, hundreds of injuries and over\none hundred arrests.\nA year has passed since the violent halting\nof these protests and yet little has changed for\nthe Western Sahara. Despite global support\ntowards many uprisings throughout the Arab\nworld, the Saharawi people have been largely\nignored by the international community; a\ncommon theme in their thirty-six year struggle\nfor independence. Surely now, with increasing\npressure on Syria and new aspiring democracies forming in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, is\nthe time to recognise the true beginning of this\nmovement and give them the recognition and\nsupport they deserve.\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: Tim Arbabzadah\nSam Horti\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nO\nn Monday 21st November and Tuesday 22nd\nNovember Imperial\u2019s International Tamil Society\norganised and ran a successful Breaking the Silence Campaign.\nThey are one of eight different universities in London participating in the\ncampaign. Their stalls quickly became\noverwhelmed with inquisitive passers-by, who were interested and, more often\nthan not, shocked and infuriated at what\nthey learnt at the stall. There was also a\nKrispy Kreme sale which helped raise\n\u00a3150 and will go towards those caught\nup in the final days of the war in 2009.\nFor those of you who weren\u2019t able to at-tend, or those who are further interest-ed, this article details the message that\nBreaking the Silence is trying to convey.\nSri Lanka stands accused of war\ncrimes by international human rights\norganisations for some of the most\nhorrifying human rights violations in\nhistory. Despite the UN calling for an\n\u201cindependent investigation\u201d into the\nbloody climax of the war in 2009, the\nGovernment has dismissed all international concerns as \u201cpreposterous\u201d. In a\nlittle over a month, over 40,000 innocent\ncivilians, who came exclusively from\nthe Tamil community, which forms the\nisland\u2019s largest ethnic minority, were\nbutchered, having been systematically\nshelled in public places. The Sri Lankan\narmy, which is overwhelmingly made\nup of the country\u2019s largest ethnic group,\nthe Sinhalese, left no refuge untouched\nas they deliberately targeted hospitals,\nschools and even a governmentally declared \u201csafe zone\u201d. This so-called \u201csafe\nzone\u201d quickly became a killing field,\nwith thousands of desperate Tamil civilians who had fled there (under the impression that they would be safe from\nthe military\u2019s indiscriminate bombing)\nbeing killed. Such a heinous act can only\nbe described as genocide.\nWorse still is the manner in which this\ngenocide was carried out. In addition to\naerial bombardment and artillery shells,\nthe Sri Lankan army used cluster bombs\nand chemical weapons, which have been\nprohibited by numerous international\nagreements including the Geneva Protocol. These types of bombs, even if targeted at an enemy building, will wreak\nhavoc on nearby civilians with devastating consequences. Using cluster bombs\nto target a guerrilla fighting force, who\nwere defending thousands of civilians,\nsuggests a deliberate attempt to inflict\nheavy civilian casualties. It will come\nas no surprises that Sri Lanka is not one\nof the 108 signatories of the Convention\nof Cluster Munitions, which prohibits\nthe use of cluster bombs. Given the Sri\nLankan army\u2019s recent, unrestrained use\nof such weapons, there remains a very\ngrave threat of further use to crush any\nfuture uprisings.\nHuman rights organisations and political analysts have pointed out that future\nuprisings are inevitable if the government continues on its path of oppression.\nDespite the conclusion of the war over\ntwo years ago, and the government\u2019s\npromises to rehabilitate and relocate\nall of the IDP\u2019s (or internally displaced\npersons) by 2009, 20,000 of the 300,000\nTamil people originally illegally de-tained, without charge or trial within\nthese camps, are still languishing. Ban\nKi-moon, the Secretary-General of the\nUN, described the camps as \u201cthe most\nappalling scenes I have seen.\u201d Indeed\nChannel 4 have released videos showing\npeople incarcerated with a severe lack\nof food and water, women separated\nfrom families and even sexual abuse.\nA leaked US embassy cable, courtesy\nof Wikileaks, described how the army\nran prostitution rings, trafficked young\ngirls, and sexually assaulted very young\ngirls. Bodies of the dead were left where\nthey were and even more were killed in\nstampedes to secure food from the insufficient supplies. Unsurprisingly NGO\u2019s\nwere denied access to these camps and\njournalists were strictly forbidden.\nThe Sri Lankan civil war has its roots\nin decades of discrimination against\nthe Tamils by successive governments,\nvoted in by the Sinhalese majority. Any\nattempt by Tamils to peacefully protests\nagainst the state\u2019s discriminatory poli-cies, resulted in numerous anti-Tamil\nriots, in which thousands were killed by\nmobs.\nOne of the first of such policies was\nthe \u201cSinhala Only Act\u201d in 1956. This\nmade Sinhala the sole official language\nin Sri Lanka and forced almost all of the\nTamil people working in the civil service to resign, due to a lack of fluency\nin Sinhala, making thousands of highly\nskilled and highly educated Tamils un-employed. The economic existence and\ncareer hopes of Tamil people were further dashed by the \u201cPolicy of Standardisation\u201d, introduced in 1973, which saw\nTamil students having to achieve significantly higher marks than their Sinhalese\ncounterparts in order to enter university.\nThese ills were not met without resistance from the Tamil populace however.\nThirty years of peaceful protests, met\nonly with brutal violence and further\noppression, resulted in the Vaddukoddai\nResolution being signed in 1976 by the\nSri Lanka\u2019s silent genocide\nVisakan Balakumar\nSri Lankan armed forces are\naccused of carrying out genocide\nCouncil Chairman Baroness Eliza Manningham-Buller concluded her statement to the\nAll Party Parliamentary Group on Thursday\n17 November calling on Government to\nhold a \u201cproper, and preferably non-political\nconversation, on [the issue of drugs], to review current policies and explore whether\nthere are others offering better hope of\nsuccess.\u201d Nevertheless, amongst the various reasoned and well measured responses to the suggestions, last week\u2019s speech\nhas perhaps predictably generated opposition solely focusing on the cannabis angle,\nleading to claims of \u201cspongy liberalism\u201d in\none particular publication. Such suggestions could not be further from the truth.\nA review into our current drugs policy is,\nat the very least, long awaited. Indeed, the\neffects that drugs have had on the criminal industry for the past several decades\nshow no immediate signs of abating. Eliza\nremarked in her speech on the wide range\nof \u201cmisery\u201d that drugs perpetrate. That is\nnot to say (as some publications appear to\nhave implied) that it was suggested that\nthe immediate legalisation of cannabis\nwould suddenly solve the problem at hand.\nRather, Eliza said that a considered \u201cnonpolitical\u201d conversation would certainly be a\nfirst step towards a full and frank review.\nSuch a review would be a bold move by the\ngovernment that has already taken bold\nmoves with regards to the budget and other\naspects of policy.\nObviously, with the ongoing concessions\nthat can only accompany a Coalition Government, such an objective may appear to\nbe increasingly far off, especially with the\ngovernment\u2019s current stance on drugs. Political machinations play no part in an issue so interconnected with areas as wide\nas crime and health. A review conducted\nby the country\u2019s most informed scientific\nminds, outside of the country\u2019s current political climate would, at least, avoid snap\ndecisions in terms of legalisation. One can\nonly hope that the government recognises\nthe growing list of scientific figures calling\nfor such a debate.\nFelix applauds Eliza\u2019s decision to add\nher voice to this list. Our Chairman\u2019s message has generated much needed debate\nacross the country on an issue that certainly needs a rethink, not least following the\nsurge of popularity in \u2018legal highs\u2019 over the\nlast few years. After all, surely it is better to\nhave a full understanding of the potential\ndangers of drugs, rather than taking even\ngreater risks?\nthen major Tamil party, TULF (or Tamil\nUnited Liberation Front). This resolu-tion, with no end to the discrimination\nin sight, demanded a separate state for\nTamil people in the North and East of\nSri Lanka called Tamil Eelam, where\nTamil people made up the overwhelming\nmajority. The TULF won 18 out of the\n23 seats they contested in the North and\nEast and became the first time in history\nthat a Tamil party formed the opposition.\nThis unprecedented level of support reflected the Tamil nation\u2019s aspiration for\nfreedom. It was a demand that was given\nthe mandate of the people, before the\nLTTE began its armed resistance.\nPeaceful methods to achieve this\nstate failed. Those who participated in\nthe protests had their skulls cracked by\nbayonets and rifle heads. Protesters were\nstamped on before eventually being dispersed by shooting. However in 1983\none of the saddest moments of the war\noccurred. Sinhalese mobs, backed by the\nSri Lankan military and police force, descended upon the homes and businesses\nof Tamil people in Colombo. Over 3,000\nordinary Tamil people were killed in just\na few days, thousands more injured and\n18,000 businesses burnt. Rioters were\novertly helped by the government, who\nhanded them voter lists in order to identify Tamil households. No one has ever\nbeen charged in relation to this slaughter.\nSince that moment, the Sri Lankan\nArmed Forces have committed many\nheinous war crimes and human\u2019s right\nviolations. However, as in Rwanda and\nSrebrenica, the World chose to stand\nback and watch in 2009. Please do not let\nmurderers and war criminals go unpun-ished. Please help us break the silence.\nYou can help by signing the e-petition,\ntitled \u201cIndependent, international investigation into war crimes in Sri Lanka\u201d\non http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/.

    "content": "ARTS\nFELIX Friday 25 November 2011 21\nMe being me, and this being only\nmy second ever comedy gig, I was a\nlittle sceptical about certain aspects\nof last Friday\u2019s line-up at The Hammersmith Apollo. A childrens\u2019 enter-tainer? Musicians telling jokes? Charity?! Retrospectively, however, my\naversion to live comedy was wholly\nunfounded. I loved it. Being a one-night-only gig, I\u2019m not sure however\nas to what a Felix report should say\nother than \u201cha, I got to see the show\nand you didn\u2019t\u201d. My perception of reviews is that they are a tool for promoters yearning to sell more tickets\nto subsequent nights\u2019 shows. Perhaps\nI\u2019m supposed to plug next year\u2019s concert (it\u2019s an annual thing for \u2018Friends\nof the Earth\u2019, a charity whose main\nfocus for the foreseeable future is Climate Change). Or perhaps I\u2019m supposed to plug comedy gigs in particu-lar. Whatever it is, overall the whole\nnight was exemplary.\nOur host for the evening, The Inbetweeners\u2019 Greg Davies skilfully com-pered. Whilst his \u2018bulky\u2019 6\u20198\u201d frame\nand ill-fitting T-Shirt was the cause of\nmuch discomfort for the front three\nrows of the stalls, it was also the main\nsubject of his self-degradation and\nconsequent enjoyment of the audi-ence.\nAs a mathematician, the evening\nparticularly appealed to my inner\ngeek. Richard Herring, after warming up with a few disconnected\njokes finally stuck with the story of\nhis Fererro Rocher Valentines Day\npromise, as well as to how his failure to appreciate exponential growth\n(\\Sigma{2^{years together}}) will\nbankrupt him.\nHeadliner Tim Minchin stuck with-the mathematical tack and convinced\nthe audience that comedians who\ntry out new material in small groups\naren\u2019t taking large enough sample\nsizes \u2013 and that anything below the\nApollo\u2019s (sold-out) capacity of three-thousand two hundred would make\nthe test unfair. He noted that 90% of\nthe audience had no idea what a p-val-The residents of South Kensington\nhaven\u2019t laughed so hard since a local\nScience University said it was going to publish a newspaper! Cue the\ndrums and cymbal.\nDon\u2019t worry, you can expect much\nbetter material from the actual come-dians. The Comedy Hoopla is, you\u2019ve\nguessed it, a comedy night. It takes\nplace in the underground bar of The\nHoop and Toy (near South Kensington station) at the start of each month.\nThe old-school-pub and down-the-cellar-feel combine to give an intimate atmosphere, transporting you\nout of London and imbuing one with\nthe sense that there is nothing to do in\nthe world but enjoy the acts.\nThis, in my opinion, is almost a cer-tainty. The comedians ranged from\nself-proclaimed German Comedy\nAmbassador Henning Wehn through a\nvery loud, fairly Northern Tony Tinman to the wacky, sex-lined folk duo\nClantessential with more innuendos\nthan you can shake a stick at.\nThe show is split into three parts\nwith several acts in the first two;\nthe headliner taking the last third. In\nbetween, you pop to the bar, grab a\npint and chat with some of the other\ncomedy enthusiasts. If you\u2019re feeling\nbrave, the petite nature of the venue\nallows you to go and chat with your\nfavourite comedian, something I\navoided following a failed heckle.\nThere was some real talent on show\nthat night. Present was the much acclaimed Tez Ilyas (victor of the\naforementioned heckling match, and\nother less prestigious accolades), with\nPattie Brewster and Sam Furniss,\namongst others. The comedy itself\nwas a real mixed bag. Ilyas used a\nStewart Lee like dissection combined\nwith the subversion of several stereo-types; the difference between Catholics and Muslims being a memorable\none. Brewster did a good impression\nof a mad cat lady, despite being a\npretty attractive young lady. Tony\nTinman used his obvious charm to\ndiscuss the delicacies of anal bleaching and Sam Furniss, something of a\nregular at the Hoopla I gathered, regaled us with tales of his family. The\nheadliner, Henning Wehn has recently\nappeared on QI and brought a bit of\nclass to the proceedings. By this I\nmean he brought some good old fashioned Brit-bashing banter, observations which seemed to go down well\nwith a South Ken audience.\nNot one of the acts was poor and\nthis is testament to the hard work the\norganisers put into finding great people for the event. The M.C (Master\nof Ceremonies) and other organisers\nblatantly take pride in their work. It\nwas this and the fact that we all thoroughly enjoyed the night that makes\nme sure you won\u2019t be disappointed if\nyou take my advice: buy a ticket and\nget giggling!\nComedy Hoopla at The Hoop and\nToy (South Kensington); returns\non December 7.

Minchin\nclosed with a magical audience participation rendition of Buckley\u2019s \u2018Hallelujah\u2019.

The musician\u2019s jokes\nhowever, were slightly less well re-ceived; his tales weren\u2019t a patch on\nthose told by his colleagues over the\ncourse of the evening.\nThe music continued and took a\nChristmas-sy twist after the interval\n\n"

You\nremember? It was the\none that kept using the word socialist to\ndescribe a bunch of people expressing\nan opinion. You don\u2019t remember. That\u2019s\nalright, it\u2019s not really necessary for what\nI\u2019m going to say anyway. Let\u2019s begin\nwith the Occupy protests, and leave\nGeorge to one side for a while.\nThe Occupy protests are interesting.\nI\u2019ve long since stopped reading Internet\nnews-wheel Reddit thanks to an increasing torrent of people using it to post\nopinions they know others will slavishly massage back at them, and a lot of\nthis came down to posts about the Occupy protests. The protests were right,\nReddit said. Everyone else was wrong,\nReddit said. That was that. It\u2019s a special\nbrand of single-mindedness, which, to\nme, almost always indicates someone\nwho has not really thought through what\nthey are doing.\nDespite this, the Occupy protests\nhave interesting points. If you go to the\nhomepage of Occupy London Stock\nExchange and look at their public state-ment, the first point is simple and con-cise, and mostly apolitical. It\u2019s a simple\nstatement of opinion, and it reads: \u201cThe\ncurrent system is unsustainable.\u201d These\npeople are protesting because they believe the people who have the capacity\nto change the current system are also\nthe people who stand to lose least from\nAngry Geek\nThe best way to die\nOccupying the middle ground\nthe way the system is currently running.\nThat is not the statement of a socialist.\nThat is the statement of someone who\nhas a concern about the way a government is being run.\nSocialism is a talk for another day, but\n\u2013 and George, you can come back now,\nthanks for waiting \u2013 whenever it is to be\nused in conversation it cannot be used\nas a vague cudgel with which to smack\naround arguments. You don\u2019t have to be\nsocialist to object to government action.\nYou merely have to have an opinion,\nand a voice.\nI don\u2019t think people have to stay out\nin the cold at night to make use of their\nvoice (incidentally, the thermal-scan-ning of the tents was debunked a few\ndays later as fraudulent), and I don\u2019t\nthink people have to be nice, clean,\nwell-dressed and well-behaved people\nin order to be allowed to hold an opin-ion. If we were allowed to expel people\nfrom society for the way they looked\nthen I\u2019d have exiled any and all people\nwho decided a white shirt under a jumper looked \u2018trendy\u2019 at the start of the cen-tury. But that doesn\u2019t make the people\nwho wear those shirt/jumper combos\nless justified in holding an opinion. It\njust makes them look like a sixth-form\nstudent who recently discovered Marks\nand Spencer.\nGeorge\u2019s article is troubling. Like\nmany people who hold views similar\nto him, George is interested in attacking the people behind the protests, their\nways of life, their standards of living,\nA\ncouple of weeks ago, I had\nan interesting discussion in\nthe kitchen in my hall about\na quite exotic topic. I wanted to share my \u2018insights\u2019\ninto the issue with you and maybe give\na helping hand to those of you struggling\nwith this peculiar question. The question\nis: \u201cHow would you kill yourself?\u201d\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t have\nany desire to do so, and neither did anybody who participated in that discussion\n(I hope). But this is the kind of topic you\ncome up with if you\u2019ve worn out the\nquestion \u201chow was your day?\u201d, which,\nif we are honest, just deeply annoys us.\nI mean, seriously, if you ask that question\nto somebody, it is just to make conversa-tion. On most occasions you don\u2019t even\nlisten to their answer. And since most\npeople at Imperial study all day long,\neven when I occasionally listen to other\npeople telling me how shit their day was,\nthe only thing I get out of it is that I\u2019m not\nthe only one feeling likeAmy Winehouse\nsober \u2013 and we all know how that one\nended, right?!\nSo here we are again, back on to the\nquestion I asked earlier. Would you just\ndrink yourself to death like somebody\nfamous whom I don\u2019t have the balls to\nmention here, or would you take poison\nand fall asleep? Would you throw yourself off a bridge or a tall building, or\nwould you rather cut your arteries open?\nWould you throw yourself in front of a\ntrain, or would you hang yourself fixed to\nthe ceiling of the men\u2019s room?\nAll of these methods have been proven\nto be successful, with some more effective than others. Personally, I would\nnever throw myself in front of a train because you create a) emotional trauma for\nthe train conductor and b) a major delay\nfor all the people in the train. No, if I go,\nI want to leave no mess behind and no\nmajor inconvenience. I also don\u2019t want\nanybody to be traumatised for the rest of\ntheir life after finding me.\nSo what remains: drugs? Yeah, that\nwould be an option, although I have to\nsay that I don\u2019t like the thought of that\nbrief period of helplessness between taking the pills (or whatever form of drug I\nam using) and death. The idea of waiting\nfor death to come sounds like hell to me.\nThrow yourself off a building? A bridge?\nThe building is not an option because I\ncould fall on somebody, accidentally\nbringing harm to others, when really I\nwas only trying to end my own miserable\nexistence. The bridge would be better because any major obstacle could be spotted in advance and if I fall on a seagull,\nI pretty much don\u2019t give a shit. My problem with that solution is that I don\u2019t trust\nall these guys that say \u201cwater becomes as\nhard as concrete after 15 meters\u201d, maybe\nbecause I\u2019ve seen too many C-class movies where guys survive 100 metre falls\nout of hovering helicopters.\nWell, this leaves us with two viable op-tions: to cut your arteries open or to hang\nyourself, preferably in a bath tub/men\u2019s\nroom (or girl\u2019s room, I don\u2019t want to dis-their worth as people \u2013 instead of looking at the reasons for their protests, and\ndiscussing those issues properly. This\nisn\u2019t troubling because it\u2019s poor journalism \u2013 that would be rich coming from\nthe man who wrote six hundred words\ncomparing porridge to atheism. It\u2019s\ntroubling because Imperial, unlike other\nplaces where such matters might be discussed by people our age, actually contains many of the people who will go on\nto make up the 1% in decades to come.\nWhile I joke on an almost weekly basis about my reasons for despising all of\nyou, the truth is that there are moments\nof genuine disgust as I read Twitter, Felix or listen in to conversations in the\nJCR. Many of you aren\u2019t just humour-ously dislikeable. You\u2019re worryingly\nsingle-minded. That goes for both sides\nof the political spectrum, whether you\ncry socialists when people express opinions that differ from yours, or cheer on\nthe Occupy protests as evidence that\nthe Government was out to get you all\nalong. If you think the answer to any of\nour future problems lies in just the one\nideological textbook, then you\u2019re going\nto do more harm than good.\nThink I\u2019m wrong about the Occupy\nprotests? Do you think the shirt/jumper\ncombination helps you score with the\nladies? Feed me your wrong opinions\nat: anangrygeek@gmail.com\ncriminate against anybody) so it\u2019s easier\nfor others to clean. I know, it is not ideal,\nmainly because the person that\u2019s going\nto find me is going to be quite shocked.\nThat\u2019s why I would call the cops and tell\nthem that I heard a noise in my room and\nthat I think that somebody broke in. Of\ncourse, I would leave a letter on the floor\napologising for the inconvenience since,\nalthough they are cops, they don\u2019t see\ndead people every day like Haley Joel\nOsment in The Sixth Sense. The only\nquestion that remains is: what is worse?\nFinding somebody hanging from the\nceiling looking down at you with a pale,\nwhite face of death? Or seeing somebody\nsubmerged in a bath tub full of blood?\nAs you can tell, this discussion has\ngotten both rather detailed and a little\ndisgusting. And with an inexhaustible\namount of ways to end your own life, it\nis a discussion that could last for a very\nlong time.

    "content": "FELIX\n36\nTRAVEL\nTravel Editors: Dushi Arumuganesan\nChris Richardson\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 25 november 2011\nVeliko Tarnovo is one of the oldest settlements in Bulgaria, dating back at least five million years. Nicknamed \u2018the Old Capital\u2019, this\ntimeworn city sits in a mountainous region of\nnorthern Bulgaria, surrounded by forestry and\nwildlife unlikely to be seen almost anywhere\nelse in Europe.\nBulgaria has undergone more than its fair\nshare of transformations through a political timeline heavily peppered with dynasties,\nuprisings and wars. It\u2019s this rich past that has\nyielded such incredible Bulgarian sights and\nwonders including, but not limited to, some of\nthe world\u2019s oldest churches, monasteries and\nmosques (a reminder of the 500 years or so\nduring which Bulgaria was a part of the Ottoman Empire and sequestered from the rest of\nEurope).\nWishing you were here\nthe very centre of the bridge and looking down\nprovides an incredible vantage point from\nwhich to admire the overwhelming display of\nBulgarian beauty spiralling out from the river\nfor miles and miles. The bridge also leads the\nway to Asen\u2019s monument and the city art gallery (which, incidentally, offers free entry on\nThursdays).\nVenturing slightly further afield, the village\nof Arbanassi (pronounced most satisfyingly, if\nnot entirely correctly, in the strongest Scottish\nburr you can muster) lies four kilometres away\nfrom Veliko\u2019s centre and is famous for being at\nthe crux of the liberation of Bulgaria from the\nOttoman Empire. Comprehensively dispersed\nwith monasteries, convents and churches all ornately decorated and well-preserved from up to\nfive centuries ago, an afternoon in this village\nis easily passed.\nVeliko\u2019s Main Street is home to most of the\nworkshops and market stalls mentioned earlier.\nThe districts of Gurko Street and Samovodska Charshia are the best examples of archaic\nTarnovan charm. It may feel as though you\u2019ve\nstumbled onto the pages of an oddly Balkan\nDickensian novel as craftsmen ranging from\ncarpenters and potters to blacksmiths and farriers set up shop for the day.This central vicinity\nof Veliko is very hilly and, although walking\nis the common mode of transport here, you\nshouldn\u2019t feel too guilty about hailing a taxi\nor two at the astonishingly cheap fares they\ncharge.\nNumerous eateries, from small, family-run\ncafes to chain restaurants, are located along\nMain Street, many serving solely Bulgarian\nfare. A warning to all vegetarians: you will\nfeel severely limited in choice when eating out\n\u2013 Bulgarian food is exceptionally carnivore-friendly. Not only is food (and everything else)\nridiculously cheap, but the amount of it dished\nup at one sitting will leave you immobile for\na good few hours post-meal. And then there\u2019s\nsalt. Salt is a big deal here. Naturally, it\u2019s distributed by the bucket-load onto standard items\nsuch as meat and vegetables\u2026 but then there\u2019s\nsalted yoghurt. And the Frosties in Bulgaria are\nfrosted with, you guessed it, salt.\nTourists should take advantage of Veliko\u2019s\nsurroundings, and spend a day hiking nearby.\nIt is not uncommon to come across excavation\ngroups made up of archaeologists and amateur\nhistory buffs digging to discover historical remains and artefacts en route to the top of the\nmountains and hills enclosing Veliko. There are\nstill exhilarating finds being made here to date,\nand no doubt will be for years to come. For\nmany of the locals however, the neighbouring\ngreenery is just their back garden \u2013 a fact that\nwas only really brought home to me when upon\nasking to speak to the owner of a shop regarding\nhis (hand-crafted) wooden toys, I was told that\n\u201chis phone is not ringing, he must be climbing\nmountains \u2013 perhaps you wait an hour?\u201d\nIt would not be impartial enough of me to finish without at least mentioning Veliko\u2019s \u2018new\ntown\u2019, consisting mainly of the very recently\nbuilt shopping mall with its bowling alley, casino and cinema complex. However, I will say\nthis \u2013 just skip it. The old quarter is where Veliko\u2019s spirit and, dare I say it, Bulgaria\u2019s heart,\ntruly lie.\n\u201ca city defined by its ubiquitous feeling of renaissance\u201d\nDushi Arumuganesan\nExploring the \u201cOld Capital\u201d of Bulgaria to discover the deep-seated history\nof a state abundant in old-fashioned splendour and beauty\nTerrific Tarnovan tales\n\u2018The Night of Baths, Budapest\u2019 by Balazs Mohai\nLooking down on Veliko and the Yantra from midway up the Tsaravets...\nBut where a suddenly booming economy has\nled to real estate tycoons and construction company giants laying claim to many major cities,\nespecially along the extremely popular Black\nSea coast, Veliko has largely managed to resist.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, cities such as Sofia and\nVarna \u2013 so different in nature to Veliko \u2013 are\nstill well worth visiting. Both of these places,\namong others, have retained their inherent historical significance and charisma while making\na fluid transition from Balkan cities trapped behind the Iron Curtain to cosmopolitan Eastern\nEuropean hubs. Veliko, on the other hand, holds\nan equal if not greater allure in its antiquated\nsetting of old markets, artisan workshops and\nTarnovan inns.\nIn fact, as central as Veliko has been to the\nmost momentous points in Bulgaria\u2019s history,\nit is most importantly associated with its role in\nthe \u2018National Awakening of Bulgaria\u2019, a time of\nuprisings and revolts against the Ottoman rulers of the country. Unsurprisingly, even today\nVeliko remains a city defined by its ubiquitous\nfeeling of renaissance; a feeling entrenched in\nnot only the buildings and natural wonders but\nalso in the city\u2019s inhabitants.\nThe city\u2019s tourist trade is dominated by the\nimposing Tsaravets fortress, which stands at the\nsummit of the hill of the same name and is a\nreminder that Veliko was once the capital city\nof the Second Bulgarian Empire. These ruins\nof the extravagant palaces of former monarchs\nand the once impenetrable fortress with its several bulwarks (running up to almost twelve feet\nthick!), are a stark contrast to the gently meandering Yantra River below, another of Veliko\u2019s\npicturesque attributes. Stambolov\u2019s bridge,\na striking structure made of steel, is a more\nmodern, man-made symbol of Veliko\u2019s part in\ngaining Bulgaria\u2019s independence.

On\nthe road to Birmingham, with no idea of what\nlay ahead, the lads discussed the best starting\nline-up for the team. Arriving at P\u00e1irc na h\u00c9ireann by the official starting time, a first for\nthe IC lads, gave the team enough time for a\nwarm up and some drills.\nAlong with ourselves, in Division 2 there\nwere teams from Liverpool Hope, Liverpool\nJohn Moore\u2019s, Cambridge and Dundee universities competing in the 13-aside competi-tion. A group stage was used to decide who\nprogressed into the semi-finals and their seed-ing. In our group were Dundee and Liverpool\nJohn Moore\u2019s; two traditionally strong Hurling\nsides.\nWith a pep talk from our managers, Brendan\nEarley from St Gall\u2019s and John Harvey from\nKeady, before our first match against Dundee,\nthe team were ready to step up to the challenge\nahead of us. Starting with the wind at their\nback Dundee proved a strong opposition getting the first score despite a solid defence from\nNeil Clancy and Tadgh Carroll. With some\nsolid plays from the mid field pairing of Finian\nMcCann and James Shanahan the London side\nbattled hard to take the lead by a point into the\nsecond half.\nNot long into the second half it was clear\nthat Imperial/St. Mary\u2019s had the edge. Despite\nhis recent knee-capping, right up to the final\nwhistle, Under-21 Tyrone Captain Ryan Jones\nmade short work of ensuring any ball that ventured into the small rectangle was in the back\nof the net. With a strong performance from the\nLondon side and a final score of 4-10 to 1-4,\nthe boys in blue were quietly confident for the\nmatches to come.\nFor the second of the two group stages an\nunchanged London side lined out against an\noverly confident Liverpool John Moore\u2019s.\nFrom the throw in it was clear that Imperial/\nSt. Mary\u2019s had the upper hand. Half forwards\nDonal McCann (St. Mary\u2019s Captain) and Armagh goalkeeper Joby Burke continually\nknocked balls over the bar. Again the goal machine and future seminarian Jones kept the\nLiverpool goalie very busy with the help of the\ntwo corner forwards Paul McGovern and John\nMcGuckin. Goalkeeper Benjamin Ryder made\nsome great saves to keep John Moore\u2019s score\nline to a minimum. By the final whistle London had gathered a healthy 18 point lead on\nLJMU with the end score of 6-9 to 2-3.\nAs the two group matches were used to seed\nthe semi-finals it was decided that the matches\nwere to be Liverpool Hope vs. Dundee and Imperial/St. Mary\u2019s vs. Liverpool John Moore\u2019s.\nDue to the result of the previous match the\nLondon team thought they had this one in the\nbag, unfortunately the first half didn\u2019t go quite\nas planned despite defenders Padhraic Comerford and Jerome Scullin\u2019s best efforts. With\nonly a single point lead the London managers\ngave the lads a severe talking to that brought\neveryone back to earth. Half-back Kevin\nParke, straight from Mount Vernon, took the\nbull by the horns and made sure LJMU didn\u2019t\nsteal the game from under our nose.\nSean Dunne made some great runs forward\nmaking sure the ball was always well into Liverpool\u2019s half. Burke once again made short\nwork of the John Moore\u2019s defence and with a\ngreat ball to Jones the Londoners got a goal\nup despite the Liverpudlian umpire\u2019s protesta-tions. With a score of 4-3 to 1-2, Imperial/St.\nMary\u2019s made it to the final for the first time.\nFilled with nerves and anticipation the London team knew they would have a hard battle\nahead of them. Imperial/St. Mary\u2019s won the\ncoin toss and Imperial Captain John McGuckin\nopted to play into the wind for the first half,\njust as every previous match had been played.\nLiverpool Hope with the wind at their backs\nmanaged to get the first score of the match with\na point from distance. A Trojan defending effort was given from the backs headed by Clancy, Parke and Carroll keeping Hope\u2019s score to\njust a single point for the first half. Just before\nhalf time Imperial/St. Mary\u2019s were frustrated\nwith the referee\u2019s controversial decision to declare a brilliant goal from Jones as a square ball\n(similar to offside in soccer); London a point\ndown going into the second half.\nWith an awe inspiring speech from managers Earley and Harvey at half time the London\nboys were ready to take on anything. Imperial/\nSt. Mary\u2019s got straight into action with a short\ndistance point from full forward Jones. Donal\nMcCann got another point for the London side\nbefore Hope replied with a score; Imperial/St.\nMary\u2019s now leading by a point. With an illegal\ntackle on half-forward Sean Dunne, London\nhad a free from around the half way line. Burke\ndidn\u2019t wait long to take the free and struck the\nball beautifully into the back of the net, which\nmay or may not have tipped off Jones\u2019s hurl.\nThe goal effectively the ended the game,\nwith some great defending from both sides before the final whistle (final score: 1-3 to 0-2)\nwhen Imperial/St. Mary\u2019s were crowned as the\nBritish Universities Division 2 Hurling Champions, a first for either club. The Londoners,\nfilled with pride and trophy in hand, looked\nforward to the night of celebrations ahead of\nthem.\nSure, he looks angry, but you didn\u2019t hear what the ball had said about his mum earlier\n\n"

Talk loudly about how much work\nyou have.

    "content": "TELEVISION\nFELIX Friday 25 November 2011 27\nSo bad it\u2019s good - Waterloo Road\nI don\u2019t normally watch shows in the \u2018so bad it\u2019s\ngood\u2019 category \u2013 there are far too many genuinely good programmes which I can devote my\ntime to. The one exception to this rule is Waterloo Road. The first time I saw it I was instantly\nhooked: it was truly the most ridiculous thing\nthat I had ever seen on TV. The action takes\nplace in an unbelievably incompetently run secondary school in Rochdale, where the average\npupil death rate is one per term. This is a show\nin which the staff go drinking in the pub every\nday after lessons; where everybody in a position of authority higher than the Headmaster is\ninsane or frankly just plain evil and where the\nschool motto, \u201cex nihilo omnia\u201d (everything\nfrom nothing) actively insults the pupils.\nIn my favourite episode, the series six finale,\na student and a teacher elope to Gretna Green to\nget married; two other pupils set off explosives\nduring the school play and then run off to mess\nabout on a railway viaduct where one of them\ngets stuck; and a fourth pupil becomes paralysed\nafter tumbling to the ground when he goes up\nonto the viaduct to rescue his friend (of course\nhe is miraculously and inexplicably cured over\nthe summer holidays and the incident is never\nspoken of again). To add to the staff\u2019s troubles\nthis all happens on the day when the school is\nbeing visited by the head of the governors.\nGiven that everything that happened could be\ntraced directly to their ineptitude and poor supervision of pupils, in the real world the Head\nTeacher and her deputy would have immediately been suspended. Here, however, in what\nis the most hilarious scene that I have ever seen\non television the head of the governors actually\ncongratulates them on their good work, based\nsolely on some good predicted GCSE grades.\nHaving seen the behaviour of the students in\nclass I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if it turned\nout that these had been falsified.\nI\u2019m sorry to say, however, that the latest series has been getting better. Not by enough to\nbe called good by any means, just enough to become mediocre and boring. Fortunately the final\nepisode of this series, broadcast last week, saw\nthe writers returning to old habits and giving us\nanother laughter inducing offering.\nThe episode opens with the Head of PE lying\ndepressed on his friend\u2019s sofa after having just\nfound out that his wife Sian, who is the Deputy\nHead Teacher, had been cheating on him with\nthe new Head, Michael Byrne. He\u2019s soon feeling better, however, as he\u2019s back in school to\nlodge a formal complaint against Michael and\nto unexpectedly take his children out of class to\ntell them that they are leaving for Ireland later\nthat very same day.\nThe funny thing with Waterloo Road is that,\nno matter how many plot holes this creates, each\nepisode takes place over the course of just one\nschool day. An episode focusing on a longer period of time might develop some pacing issues,\nbut nothing that a skilled writer and director\ncouldn\u2019t handle. Of course, such people aren\u2019t\nin abundance on the show\u2019s creative team.\nFor Michael the day beings with him standing\noutside and grabbing one of his student\u2019s arm\nto get his attention. Now, having volunteered at\nsecondary school I know that physical contact\nwith pupils is a really big no-no. It\u2019s an especially bad idea if the pupil in question just recently\nsaw you threaten a man, Wayne Johnson \u2013 a former pupil who once stabbed Michael, outside\nthe school gate and run off when he is hit by a\ntruck. As the episode progresses we see Wayne\nwaking up from his coma and breaking out of\nthe hospital to confront Michael. He takes Sian\nhostage and makes our Head admit what he\u2019s\ndone, which of course doesn\u2019t go down well\nwith Sian, who runs back to her husband.\nMichael also gets a lecture from veteran\nteacher Grantly about how no other Head at the\nschool had \u201cpromised so much and achieved so\nMaciej Matuszewski little\u201d. That\u2019s not all that fair \u2013 while Michael\nis probably the most unlikeable of all the Waterloo Road Heads on a personal level he\u2019s at\nleast so far managed to avoid any deaths on his\nwatch. He also hasn\u2019t hacked into staff email\naccounts to identify a whistleblower, like his\nfar more popular predecessor Karen did. Now\nthat I think about it, one of the whistleblower\u2019s\nemails to the LEA mentioned \u201cfalsified grades\u201d\nso perhaps my guess about the GCSE results at\nthe end of series six wasn\u2019t just an overreaction.\nA subplot of Wednesday\u2019s also deals with pupil Jodie Allen finding out that her foster parents\nare planning to move to Bristol. Not wanting to\nbe separated from her best friend she takes her\nadvice and decides that the best thing to do is\naccuse her foster father of child abuse. Eventually she admits that she was lying, but not before he is arrested and the family pretty much\ntorn apart.\nBy the end of episode, and the end-of-year\nawards ceremony (where it is heavily implied\nthat Head of English Linda Radleigh rigged\nthe vote to win the pupils\u2019 choice Best Teacher\naward), almost everybody seems to have, im-probably, made up. All I can say is that Jodie\u2019s\nfoster parents are the most forgiving people that\nI\u2019ve ever seen. It seems we\u2019re going to get a\nhappy ending until Linda, whose grip on sanity\nhas been slipping since spending a night with\nMichael and then being rejected by him, decides\nto run him over with her car.\nThis is a very fun show to watch, for all the\nwrong reasons. I\u2019m happy to hear that fifty new\nepisodes have been commissioned and that it\nwill remain on our screens until at least 2014;\nthough I really have no idea why it remains so\npopular. Surely not everybody can be watching it ironically, like I am. After all, it won this\nyear\u2019s National Television Award for Most Popular Drama.

    "content": "SCIENCE\nIn brief\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nE\nuropa is the second innermost\nof Jupiter\u2019s four large Galilean\nmoons. Scientists believe that the\nJovian satellite\u2019s icy surface hides\na liquid ocean that contains twice\nthe water than can be found in all of Earth\u2019s\noceans combined. As such it is one of the\nmost likely places in the solar system where\nextraterrestrial life could be found. However,\ngiven that it is widely believed that the upper\ncrust of ice is on average 20 kilometres thick,\nprobing for signs of life is likely to be difficult.\nBut now a group of scientists lead by Britney\nSchmidt from the University of Texas has said\nthat they believe that pockets of liquid water\nmay form far nearer the surface of the moon.\nIn a paper published last week in Nature, the\nteam describe how they used ten year old data\nfrom the Galileo obiter, and observations of ice\nstructures in the Arctic and Antarctic to explain\nthe formation of previously mysterious structures on the surface of Europa called \u201cchaos terrain\u201d \u2013 rough, vaguely circular regions which\ncan tower more than a hundred metres above\nthe surrounding ice. The team believes that the\nprocess of formation begins with the eruption\nof underwater volcanoes, similar to Iceland\u2019s\nGrimsvotn. This heats the lower layer of pure\nice in crust, which brings the heat up to higher\nlayers of salt contaminated ice, which has a\nlower melting point. As this melts, the water\nforms a sub glacial lens shaped lake of brine.\nSince liquid water is denser than ice, a space\nis left above the lake, causing the ice above to\nsag in order to fill it. As the ice bends large\ncracks are formed, into which the brine is in-jected. Eventually pressure from the brine can\ncause the ice to split apart into blocks. A similar process happens at the boundary between\nthe Antarctic ice sheet and the ocean. Being\nso close to the surface, the brine eventually\nfreezes again, pushing the blocks upwards as it\nexpands in volume and turns into ice. The frozen brine itself forms so called \u2018matrix domes\u2019,\nwhich may themselves reach higher above the\nsurrounding surface than ice blocks.\nAs well as fully formed chaos terrains, such\nas the Conamara Chaos and Murias Chaos, the\nteam believe that they have also found an area,\ncalled Thera Macula, that is halfway through\nthis process. Galileo data shows that while it is\nin many ways similar to the Conamara Chaos\nits surface is dipped below rather than raised\nabove the surrounding ice. This suggests that, if\nthe team\u2019s model is correct, liquid water of volume equivalent to the Great Lakes could exist as\nlittle as 3km under surface of this region. While\nShallow lakes on Europa\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nEuropa\u2019s \u2018Great Lake\u2019 \u2013 scientists speculate that many more exist throughout the moon\nNeutrinos still faster-than-light?\nIn September, physicists working on the Opera experiment announced that they had observed some\nsubatomic particles called neutrinos travelling faster than the speed of light. The neutrinos in question\nundertook a journey from CERN in Geneva, through\nthe Earth, and finally ended up at the Gran Sasso\nlaboratory deep underneath the mountain of the\nsame name in Italy. But they arrived at Gran Sasso\na few nanoseconds earlier than they should have\ndone, had they been travelling at the speed of light,\nsuggesting that they had in fact travelled faster.\nOpera published a pre-print paper of their results\nonline on September 22 and held a press conference the next day. Since then, physicists around\nthe world have been poring over their results and\npublishing papers trying to either find a mistake or\nuse new physics to explain what is going on.\nCarlo Contaldi, from Imperial College, suggested\nthat differences in the force of gravity at Cern and\nGran Sasso would make the clocks used to measure the time of flight of the neutrinos tick at different rates. This difference would reduce the significance of the result. Others have come up with\ndifferent criticisms.\nOpera have since refined their experiment and reported last Friday that the neutrinos still appear to\nbe travelling faster than light. In the new version of\nthe experiment, the pulses of neutrinos sent from\nCern were made thousands of times shorter than in\nthe original experiment. Many scientists criticised\nthe original long pulses because of the large errors\nthey could introduce when measuring the exact arrival time of the particles at Gran Sasso.\nThe shorter pulses allowed them to measure 20\nindividual neutrinos, each one associated with a\nspecific pulse leaving Cern. But all still appear to be\narriving too early.\nThis troubling result has the potential to overthrow\nEinstein\u2019s theory of special relativity and mess with\nthe principle of causality, which says that cause\nmust come before effect.\nHowever, physicists working on the Icarus experi-ment, also at the Gran Sasso laboratory have cast\ndoubt on Opera\u2019s results. Their work is based on\na recent paper by Boston University physicists Andrew Cohen and Sheldon Glashow, a Nobel laure-ate. Cohen and Glashow say that if the neutrinos\nhad travelled faster than light, they should have\nlost energy through releasing pairs of electrons and\npositrons. The Icarus experiment looked for this\npredicted energy loss but did not find any evidence\nof it, suggesting that the neutrinos did not travel\nfaster than light after all.\nWe will not know for sure one way or the other\nuntil independent laboratories are able to conduct\nsimilar experiments.\nJim Al-Khalili, a Professor of Physics at the University of Surrey, who after the initial result said he\nwould \u201ceat his boxer shorts live on TV\u201d if it was\nproved true, will surely welcome Icarus\u2019 findings.\nKelly Oakes\nthe team believes that it will take the water up to\na million years to freeze completely, the surface\nwill have altered by enough the next time we\nsend a probe to Europa to be able to see if the\nmodel is correct.\nIf it is, and there is shallow liquid water under\nThera Macula, this will not only give scientists a\nprime site where they can look for life but would\nalso confirm that Europa is geologically active.\nThis would be an extraordinary discovery given\nthat so far the Earth, Jupiter\u2019s moon Io and Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus are the only known geologically active bodies in the solar system.\nDOI: 10.1038/nature10608\nFELIX\n8 Friday 25 november 2011\nMaciej Matuszewski on the best evidence yet for water just below the surface\nThroughout the history of neuroscience, we\nhave often been amazed by the brain\u2019s capability and workings. Instances like the ability to\nread the jumbled headline above intrigue us \u2013\nhow is a mess of letters comprehensible?\nWe have long known that skilled readers do\nnot need to read individual letters, but until recently the mechanism behind this \u2018scanning\u2019\nmethod was not well known.\nThis year in the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, Georgetown University Medical Center (GUMC) neuroscientists\nreported their findings of a visual dictionary.\nOne of the leading theories in word recognition is that the brain simultaneously retrieves\nthe sound and the visual perception of a word\nfrom the same area of the brain. Glezer et al.\nrebut this idea through their fMRI based study\nthat allowed them to look at changes in neural\nactivity in different areas of the brain.\nGlezer says, \u201cWhat we found is that once\nwe\u2019ve learned a word, it is placed in a purely\nvisual dictionary in the brain. Having a purely\nvisual representation allows for the fast and\nefficient word recognition we see in skilled\nreaders.\u201d GUMC set out to prove this by testing word recognition for homonyms such as\n\u2018hare\u2019 and \u2018hair\u2019. They found that different\nneurons were activated, much like different\nentries in a dictionary are required for the two\nwords. If the notion of phonology and visual\nperception being interlinked held true, then the\nhomonyms would activate the same or similar\nareas of the brain. \u201cBut this was not the case\n\u2013 \u2018hair\u2019 and \u2018hare\u2019 looked just as different as\n\u2018hair\u2019 and \u2018soup\u2019\u201d explains Glezer.\nWhile she admits that on initially encountering a word we need to sound it out in order\nto encode the word and match it to the written word; subsequent presentations need no\nsounds and simply letters to correctly identify\nthe word.\nWhile the relevance of this new knowledge\nis not immediately perceptible; Glezer outlines\nthat these advancements hold exciting progress in the understanding of reading disorders\nlike dyslexia.\n\u201cIf people with dyslexia have a problem\nforming this visual dictionary, it may be that\nthere could be ways of helping train children\nwith dyslexia to form a more finely tuned visual dictionary.\u201d\nCna yuo raed tihs snentece?\nMadhura Ghosh\n\n"

    "content": "7\nFELIX Friday 25 november 2011\nFEATURE\nOrganisation recommended guidelines\nare not. Currently, only 37% of people\nin need of treatment in sub-Saharan\nAfrica actually receive it despite one\nof the Millennium Development Goals\nbeing universal access to treatment for\nHIV/AIDS for all by 2010. Treatment\nregimens in these settings are limited.\nThere is a continuing issue with resistance to the antiretrovirals and the need\nfor second line drugs in these cases\ncomplicates regimens further and steeply increases the price of antiretrovirals.\nWe\u2019re a long way off coverage for the\nmost in need; expanding drug access to\nthose who aren\u2019t even sick looks like a\ndistant dream when faced with the reality of these facts. If the current cut of\nthe pie that goes to AIDS isn\u2019t enough\nto fund treatment for those in need perhaps there should be more money going\nto AIDS treatment and, if this is the best\nprevention measure available to stop\nthe spread of this virus, we should be\nwhole heartedly pushing for an increase\nin funding for treatment as prevention.\nAsking the cynical questions, howev-F\nor anyone who has an interest in the global AIDS\npandemic and the prevention strategies underway\nto counter it, this summer\nproved to be a very exciting one. The\nresults from a ground breaking international HIV prevention study proving the practical elimination of sexual\ntransmission of HIV through the effective treatment of those infected with\nantiretroviral therapy were released\nthis July and sent the AIDS community\na tweet with possibilities. Shortly after,\nThe Economist published a title of \u2018The\nEnd of AIDS?\u2019 as its cover feature. After 30 years of searching for a solution\nthe hopes of many in seeing the end of\nthis devastating infection have been\nrevived. The only issue is that the idea\nof treatment as prevention is costly.\nIn fact, it\u2019s the most costly prevention\nintervention ever seriously considered\nfor HIV. A total of $6.9bn was given in\ninternational assistance to HIV/AIDS\nin 2010 \u2013 that represents almost 10%\nof total foreign aid given from governments to assist less fortunate countries\nfor last year \u2013 that\u2019s a large slice of\nthe aid pie for one disease. So, should\nwe really be demanding an increase\nin funding for this latest \u2018elimination\u2019\nstrategy?\nAntiretroviral therapy or ART is the\ntreatment given to HIV positive people at risk of immunocompromise to\nprevent the development of AIDS dis-eases. It works by preventing replication of the HIV virus in the body and\ntherefore reducing the levels of the virus and its destruction of immune cells.\nThis also reduces the infectiousness of\nan HIV positive person and their risk of\ntransmitting the virus on to others and\nthis is the basic premise in treatment as\nprevention. For a few years now there\nhas been an excitement bubbling below\nthe surface amongst those working in\nHIV/AIDS. There have been models\nput forward by hopeful souls foreseeing\nthe end of the epidemic in sub-Saharan\nAfrica within half a century and reports\nfrom across the world including Spain,\nTaiwan and Canada claiming reductions in HIV infection rates since the\nwidespread use of ART, but it wasn\u2019t\nuntil Myron Cohen and his team at the\nHIV prevention trials network conducted a study which showed a 96% reduction in HIV transmission that people really began to take the idea of treatment\nas prevention seriously.\nOn the face of it, the idea of increasing funding for treatment seems to be\nperfectly plausible and morally justifi-able. Treating people who are HIV positive earlier in their infection isn\u2019t such\na huge leap from a clinical perspective\nas evidence shows that it\u2019s likely to\nprolong their life. If this also practically eliminates the risk of onwards transmission onto sexual partners that is a\nmassive bonus and makes it well worth\nthe increase in investment. The problem is many of those around the world\nwho are HIV positive and should be receiving treatment under World Health\ner, is important when dealing with the\nissue of AIDS funding and one of the\ncynical questions here is exactly who is\nit benefiting from this funding for treat-ment? There is no doubt that treatment\nis good for the patient and it now appears to be good from a public health\nperspective as well, if it reduces trans-mission, but it\u2019s also very good for research institutions and drug companies.\nExpanding treatment to all those who\nare HIV positive means more investment in antiretroviral therapy development and much more money going to\ndrug companies, the majority of whom\nare based in the high income countries\nthat are kindly \u2018donating\u2019 all this money to prevent HIV/AIDS in the poorest\ncountries in the world.\nWhatever happened to those other interventions to prevent HIV? The original HIV prevention messages promoting abstinence, consistent and correct\ncondom use and remaining faithful to\nyour sexual partners seem to have been\ndrowned out by the excited screams of\nthe treatment as prevention advocates.\nMany rightly argue that these messages\nhave failed in greatly reducing rates of\nHIV infection but the fact is that condoms are almost 100% efficacious in\nstopping the transmission of HIV and\naren\u2019t anywhere near as expensive as\na lifelong course of antiretrovirals.\nCan\u2019t we persevere with these tools to\ntackle this disease instead of increasing\nfunding at the expense of other causes?\nAnd these other causes are important.\nIt is a sad fact in international aid, that\nfunding for a cause is dependent on\nhow conscious people are of it and not\nnecessarily how worthy the cause is.\nThe Schistosomiasis Control initiative\n(SCI) is an Imperial-based initative\nwhich treats Neglected Tropical Diseases or NTDs (so called because few\npeople are aware of the impact they\nhave on the very poorest in the world)\nin several countries in Africa. These\ndevastating diseases result in huge\namounts of long-term morbidity and\nmortality but are relatively unheard\nof. Treatment to cure a group of 7 of\nthese infections, including Schistosomiasis, costs just 50p per person annu-ally. 200 million of the most impoverished people in Africa are infected with\nSchistosomiasis and despite how easy\nand cost-effective it is to treat this and\nother NTDs they receive a fraction of\nthe aid funding given to HIV/AIDS\nsimply because they don\u2019t grab the\nheadlines and move people to activism\nin the same way.\nPerhaps the real issue with AIDS\nfunding isn\u2019t necessarily the amount\nthat goes to it but the highly directive\nway in which aid to countries must be\nspent. Aid for AIDS comes in a variety\nof forms but primarily bilaterally, from\none government to another, or multi-laterally through organisations such\nas the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS,\nTuberculosis and Malaria. The money\nreceived by national governments must\ngo directly to funding HIV/AIDS programmes in the country with no scope\nfor reallocation of these resources to\nother causes such as NTDs or wider\nhealthcare needs. These other causes\nare all at least as worthy of investments\nas HIV/AIDS and some would argue,\ndue to the number of people they af-fect, more worthy and in need of greater investment. Governments should be\ngranted greater flexibility in the way\nthey allocate aid resources and this can\nbe achieved with the adequate checks\nin place to ensure it goes to the good\nof the population at large, whether this\nis investing in HIV/AIDS or other pro-grammes.\nPerhaps it is not be a question over\nhow the aid pie is cut but more a question of how big the pie is. If current aid\nlevels aren\u2019t enough to ensure treatment for those in need of it be it for\nHIV or NTDs surely the solution isn\u2019t\ngreater funding for one or the other but\ngreater funding overall. Convincing\ngovernments of high income countries\nto increase overall aid funding at this\ntime is, however, in itself a whole new\nchallenge and a different aid debate.\nIs there too\nmuch aid for\nAIDS?\nNext Thursday is World AIDS Day.\nAs Medsin Imperial holds a debate to mark the occasion, Red\nElmahdi investigates the arguments surrounding aid and AIDS\nMonday 28\nNovember\nCentral Line Pubcrawl starting\nin SAF, 7pm and ending at\nTiger Tiger in aid of the Terrence Higgins Trust\n\u00a31 from each entrant on the\nTiger Tiger Medsin Guestlist\ngoes to the THT.\nTuesday 29\nNovember\nAIDS Union Super Quiz from\n8pm 568, Beit Quad.\nTest your HIV/AIDS knowl-edge.
