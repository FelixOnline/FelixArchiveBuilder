Unfortunately they were unable to fulfill expectations, due to their\nsuccess in the Womens Rowing\nCouncil Head the previous day\nwhere they were placed 8th, and\nwere disqualified whilst leading\nOxford University. The Ladies B team nearly reached the second\nround but were beaten by\nReading University First VIII, who\nmade a very late appearance at\nthe Regatta. The Mens Novices\ncomfortably won their first race\nbut came up against harder\nopposition in the second race and\nwere ele imina ted. The major event of the term, the\nTideway Head of the River saw\ndisastrous conditions with 15\ncrews sinking, but typically the IC\nteams came through unscathed.\nThe First and Second VII Is\nfinished 16th and 31st respectively out of over 400 crews with\nthe Mens Novices positioned\n237th. Several members took part in\nthe Scullers Head on the 7th April,\nthe most successful being Chris\nHowell positioned 49th out of 500.\nOver the Easter Holiday several\ncrews took part in events in\nBedford, Evesham and Lea. At the\nBedford Head, Chris repeated his\ngood performance winning the\nNovice Scullers Pennant by a wide margin. The Senior A IV\nselected finally on that day,\nsurprised everyone, not least\nthemselves, by winning their\ndivision. The Elite and Senior C cox ed IVs both came 3rd in their\nrespective sections.\nOn Easter Monday at Evesham\nRegatta both the Elite and Senior\nA IVs won their events making\ngood use of the new'carbo'lVs.\nThe final regatta of the holidays\nwas at Lea where the Senior A IV\nin their attempt to win the Elite B event were beaten in the semifinal by the eventual winners. The\nLadies, somewhat unfit after four\nweeks of comfort and inactivity,\nwon their first race without undue\neffort and reached the final after a close fought race against the\nUniversity of London Ladies.\nUnfitness told in the final which\nwas won by Thames. Chris again\nwas the winner of the day in the\nSenior C sculls.\nThus the Boat Club has been\nvery active with also the\nlightweight IV training extensively\nover the Easter Holidays with a view to qualifying for international\nrepresentation. These events\nbode well for the summer season\nwhere, with hard training, further\nsuccesses should be forth-coming.\nWater Rat\n(OH, SUPREME. SofERiNTEN&ENT -YoU'f ZE\" I WHEN YOU'R Eae oSS!

    "content": "IW HAT'S ON Sir, - Wc feel that it was very\nundemocratic of you to close\ncorrespondence about abortion\nrights. Surely as an officer of a, democratic union, in charge of l the means by which the members j of the union correspond their\nfeelings you have superseded your\nauthority as preparer of\npublications with dictatorship.\nYou were democratically elected\nnot to censor but to set.\nWe feel that the last letter you\npassed for publication, from Miss\nEarnshaw. was con travers i al and\nopen to extreme criticism. To deny us the right to do this in\nFELIX implies your support for\nits content (which may be the\ncase), and indicates the misuse of\nFELIX for private purpose.\nWhatever reasons you may\nhave had for this, it cannot\npossibly have been due to lack of\nspace for an exhausted argument.\nAs long as individuals wish to\ncomment they must not be denied\nthe means by which to do so. As\nfor lack of space, this certainly\ncannot be, as you have found\nroom for publication of letters\nbetween Jan Czernuszka and the\neditor of the Morning Cloud\nwhich are of the nature of a personal vendetta between the\ntwo and which we are sure invoke\nnothing like the interest which the\ncase of abortion rights does\namong readers.\nWe therefore ask you to reverse\nyour decision, and in future not to\nintervene in a discussion in such\nan autocratic manner.\nPete Radoja Chemistry1 Dave Bryan Mathematics 1\nColin Murray Geology 1\nDear Sir, - Oops!

Apologies all\nround.\nBut I want mainly to discuss\nhere the far more worrying\naspects contained in a letter from\na Maths PG Thingy about being\ncalled Miss. The kind of raving\nman! - hating clear in that\nparagraph is most disturbing and\ndoes no credit to the writer or the\nmovement it (I assume thing ies, are gender less) tries to further \"A it oman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle\" quotes thingy in self-asserting smugness. I can at least\nunderstand what feminists are\ntrying to achieve, but why oh why\nthe ever-present almost rabid\nman-hating? The point, thingy, is\nthat although a woman does need\na man, what is equally important\nis that a man needs a woman. The sooner thing ies and Co. realise\nthis the better it will be for us all.\nYours, etc etc\nShlomo Godsi ME II\nP.S. Notice how, with great sell-control.

For although all of us, during our\nthree years at Imperial\nCollege, will become aware to\nvarying extents of the\ninjustices, failings and disappointments which prevail in modern life, it is\nnot enough for us simply to\nkeep our hands clean. It is not\nenough for us simply to spend\nmoney on social services,\neducation, \u2022qu Hab ta! admin-is t ration and the welfare\nstate. That wealth must first\nbe created: and this is the real\nchallenge. Money must be\nearned before it can justly be\ndistributed. It is the challenge of industry: for\nthose engaged in industry at\nwhatever level, are those who\nare creating our society's wealth.\nIn answer to this very real need,\nan Industrial Society is being,\nformed at Imperial College. It\nwill offer speaker meetings and\npresentations from all levels and\ntypes of management and trade\nunionism. In addition, there will\nbe visits to factories and other\nindustrial and commercial premises, which will include not\nonly a tour around the works, but\nalso discussion with managers and\nshop stewards.\nIt is hoped that this society\nwill give you an invaluable\ninsight into the workings of\nindustry and an understanding\nwhich is important whether or not\nyou intend to take up an\nunderstanding which is\nimp rot ant whether or not you\nintend to take up an industrial or\nbusiness career. Most of us will, in\nfact enter industry when we\ngraduate; and if we are to be\nuseful and successful in the jobs\nwe do, we must choose our job.\nThat choice depends on our\nunderstanding of industry before\nwe take the pi un ge.

The MP's elected under the\nname of the Labour Party often do not reflect the policies of the Party as\ndecided by conference but this can be changed through the\nestablishment of greater democracy and accountability.\nWhat changes are needed in Britain today? We need more spending\non social services, on community projects, on the health service and on\neducation. This will open up facilities for the population and increase\nthe social standard of living. Economic changes are needed which will\nre vital is e the economy and end the scandal of the 1 V2 million\nunemployed.\nThrough taking major companies into social ownership there can be\ninvestment, expansion and planning of production such that the basic\nnecessities of life are provided for all the population. New techno lg ical advances can be used to help increase living standards instead of being\nused by employers as an excuse to throw people out of work.\nAll these things may seem a CANOE CLUB TRI-YEARLY ARTICLE\nCanoe Club have three major events planned for this term. The first is\nthe AGM on Tuesday 1 st May, Stans Bar at 8.30pm at which vo ti ng for all\nclub posts will be carried out, using a misunderstood unrepresentative\nseventeen vote system. The second attraction is a surfing trip to Croyde\nBay, North Devon, on the long weekend 5 - 7th May, hot weather and\ngood surf has been booked.\nLast but not least is a mammoth trip to France, canoeing in the\nPyrenees or Alps, for two weeks (9-22 July).

Publicity\npromotes the parties as if they were products\navailable at a supermarket and the main\ninterest has focussed on betting on the\nElection, especially on Labour, including\ntwo seperate bets of \u00a31,000 at 8-1.

Millions of visitors\nhave passed the bomb, & the Prince of Wales\nhas slept adjacent to the room where it is\nkept.\nThe butler dropped the bomb on his foot\nand a visitor, who had served in the Royal\nEngineers, recognised that the bomb was\ndangerous and arrangements were made for\nits removal.\nThursday 19th17 year old cadets with Army in Ulster\nThe Ministry of Defence admitted, tonight,\nthat schoolboy members of Combined Cadet\nForces, are being allowed to patrol Northern\nIreland's Republican trouble spots with\nregular troops.\nMrs Thatcher visits chocolate factory\nMrs Thatcher made a visit to a Birmingham\nchocolate factory while touring around the\ncountry. She would descend on a woman\nmaking chocolate and they would have a conversation. Because of the din, neither\ncould hear the other. This is the ideal\narrangement for conversation between party\nleaders and voters at election time since it\ncuts out a lot of unnecessary detail.\nFriday 20th Election is ideal for cranks\nThe Science Fiction Looney party (SFL)\nand Fancy Dress p are ty( FDP) are just some\nof the odd groups who will be fighting the\nelection. Protests have been made that the\n\u00a3150 Election deposit is too low. They blamed\nthe ludicrously low deposit figure which they\ndescribed variously as a crank's charter, open\ninvitation to extremist causes, and a mockery\nof democratic processes.\nFor their \u00a3150 deposit candidates are\nentitled to one free mailing to every elector at\nan officially estimated average cost of \u00a34,500\nfor each constituency.

Totfre standing in my light.\nThis apparently is Ian Hunter talking to himself,\nwhich is his way of explaining the albums title -wouldnt You fe Never Alone When You re a Schizophrenic' be nearer the truth?\nThis is Hunters fourth album, the first for\nChrysalis, and except for the excellent All American Alien Boy' he has not really lived up to\nthe promise of his Mott t the Hoop le days.\nTrue, there are some very good tracks on this\nrecord, but there are also some pretty pointless\nones. Life after Death* is a good example; ' is there\nlife, is there life after death?.. , Hunter moans as if\nhe had something new to tell us - he does r ft. However, consider the good points, which include his use of Bruce Springsteen^ rhythm section, excellent joint production with Mick Ronson and about four potential hit singles.\nSide one, track one is f Just another Night*, traditional E Street rock and probably the best cut.\nTwo fast numbers follow, the latter of which, Cleveland Rocks n, is far stronger than the\nprototype,' England Rocks', which was used on the\nlast tour. f Ships is a hymn-like account of Hunters\nrelationship with his father and very touching it is\ntoo, but not quite as good as * When Daylight\nComes* the new single, which closes one with a short of light, quasi-reggae love song.\nOn the whole it is side one which carries the\nalbum with only two of the four longer tracks on\nside two (the other Hunter which explains the\nalbums title) carrying their weight, these being\n'Standing in the Light' and^ Bastard7\n, the latter an exciting song of hostility.\nYes, Hunter can write infectious pop, neat hooks\nand solid rock backings; a good album, not a great\none, but still well worth a listen. It is even IC Radios Album of the week, so it cant be bad! Jon Firth\nJEAN JACQUES BURNEL - Euroman\nCometh. (UA).\nIam a Stranglers fan, let me state that right from\nthe outset. In fact I have been known to play\n*Rattus Norvegicus' continually to. myself, but I shall endeavour to direct my comments in an\nunbiased manner.\nJean Jacques Burnel is, of course, the\nStranglers'French bassist and, possibly tired of\ntheir recent work, he has branched out into\nmodern European electronic pop. The result is a promising album with good intentions which on\nthe whole doesnt come up with the goods.\nApparently Euro man Cometh is the result of JJ, homeless and sleepless, staying in the studio for\ndays on end, gradually adding to each work. The cover, which shows our man standing beneath the\nmulti-coloured pipes and poles of the Pompidou Centre, sets the industrial tone and this is\ncontinued on the record.\nIt opens with' Euro man' in which Burnel tells us\n(in French) that he is descended from\nCharlemagne, Cromwell, Napoleon and Hitler so\nits going to be one of those you think, but 'jellyfish'\nredeems the situation with its continuous drum machine beat. In fact it would not be a bad single.\nThe track ^Freddie Lake r( Concorde and\nEurobus), comes next and I can't help liking its\nbopp y rhythm, despite the fact that the vocals are\nalmost unintelligible, which is a pity as it is\nsupposed to be quite complimentary. ' Euro mess1 has a superb lead in with bass and a beating heart-pulse intertwined. The Damned! Brian James\nfigures prominently on rhythm guitar, as on many\nother tracks, and Lew Lewis adds some pretty good\nharmonica work. Dont rely on lies', sings Burn el; it\nis all rather good.\nThe second side is definately stronger, opening\nwith ' Do the European', Jean Jacques'attempt at\nEurodisco, which is quickly forgotten when\n^Triumph (Of the Coo d City)* the best track on the\nalbum, comes around. This instrumental,\nfeaturing motorbike engine noises, has been\nproduced using a semi-dub technique which keeps\nthe sound flowing as instruments come and go in\nshort snatches. Care has been taken and it shows;\nBurnel achieves what he set out to accomplish but\nonly on this track.\n*Pretty Fool* a snatch of R'n' B, which sounds not\nunlike the Stranglers, is not in the general tone of\nthe album but adds to its quality with James\nworking hard.\nThe other three tracks on the side, one of which, f crabs', is particularly annoying, are not worth\nmuch so that is it really. If the care lavished on\n^ Triumph* had been spread around a bit and if\nBurnel did not insist on singing in French, German or extremely distorted English, this would be an\nexcellent album. But it wasn't and he did. Better\nluck next time, Jean.

However, a lot of the worry of\nexams can be countered by a good examination technique.\nThe article reprinted below was produced by the College Health\nService based on a lecture given by Dr Robert Sharp of the Institute of\nBehavioural Therapy and deals with various aspects of exam strategy.\nIf you find exams particularly nerve-w racking, it is worth\nremembering that the College Health Service and the Student\nCounsellor are very good at he lft j ng to overcome the various worries\ncaused by exams and no doubt they would be happy to help you to\nperfect your own exam technique.\nALL STUDENTS SHOULD KNOW ABOUT EXAM STRATEGIES Arrive at an exam with a few minutes to spare. If you are worrying\nabout being late you will rush into the exam hall worrying and will be\neven more nervous.\nOpening Strategies.\nFor the initial 15 minutes of a3 hour exam, plan out the exam as\nfollows:\n1. Choose the questions. This means reading the paper carefully and\nthen re-reading it.\n2. Choose the order of questions.\n3. Make a timetable for the exam.\n4. Make quick notes on all the questions you intend to answer. This\nacts as a memory trigger and while writing one question you may\nremember facts about another - add them to your list.\nQuestions\nEstimate the questions you cannot do; mark those which are either\neasier or your favourite questions and select the questions which offer\nthe MOST MARKS. Order of Questions\nIf there are three questions to be answered, then put them roughly in\nthe following order:\n1) Gift question, this is the one everybody expected and prepared for.\nAnswering it first warms you up, and motivates you by getting you doing\none successfully. It can also produce a \"Halo effect\" if it is read first\nbecause it gives the examiner a mental set that \"this is a good paper\".\n2) Pet question. This is the one you hoped would appear and which\nyou can answer especially well. It is a good question to do next because\nyou are warmed up and you won't run out of time.\n3) Difficult question. If you write down as much as you possibly can,\nyou can at least collect a proportion of the possible marks, without\nsacrificing marks on the other two questions.\nTimetable\nOrganise your timetable, put it down on your answer book, put your\nwatch next to it and stick to it. For example for a3 hour exam which\nstarts at 2 pm in which you have to answer 3 questions which carry equal\nmarks then your timetable should look like this.\n2.00 Planning.\n2.15 Question 1.\n3.10 Question 2.\n4.05 Question 3.\n4.55 Finish off.\nThe timetabling of exam questions could depend on the weighting of\nmarks for the different questions. Do not borrow time from another\nquestion. This is because of the law of diminishing returns for marking\nGo for the easiest first few marks, (it is hard to get zero). The principle is\nthat it is easier to get the first 50% of marks by just answering the\nquestion. Top marks are harder to get therefore if you can manage to get\n50% on each of them, you have more chance of passing the exam than\nattempting only 2 questions where you must get the highest marks\npossible. You have a better chance of obtaining the average mark than\nyou do of doing brilliantly on only two.\nPlanning\nIn each block of time set aside on your timetable for your questions\nyou can break it down further, spending a few minutes for planning. It\nmight prove useful to reproduce at the top of the page a short-hand note\nfor the essay. At the end of your essay, draw a clean, oblique line\nthrough it to show your examiner that it was part of your notes, and not\nto be counted as part of your answer.\nDifficulties in starting and finishing essays\nSuggestion: If introductions are difficult, start with the second\nparagraph, leaving a space for the introduction. Write the bulk of your\nessay and then return to write the introduction followed by the summary\nwhich tells the reader what might have been pursued if there were more\ntime.\nStrategies if things go wrong.\n1. If you run out of time; tell the examiner you have run out of time and\nthese are the points you would have gone on to discuss.\n2. Getting stuck; allocate a time to struggle with recall or puzzling out\nthe answer. If at the end of that time, you still do not know what to\nwrite, then go on to the next question. Alter your timetable, and in\nthe remaining time at the end return to that question.\n3. Panic. Switch off. Close your eyes, do nothing for a limited time.\nThis is better than having to give up entirely. If you think you might\nbe one of those who panics and cannot cope please discuss it with\nsomeone early either your tutors, the student counsellor or one of\nthe doctors.\n4. Blank out: if you just forget everything, plan to use the \"scribble\nstrategy\" - write out words, which lead to other words, and get your\nmind thinking again.\n5. Examination Phobia: This can be helped and indeed cured by\ntherapy. If you know you have difficulties with examinations come\nand see someone at 14 Princes Gardens. Now is a good time.\nStress\nEveryone devises their own useful strategies for managing stress.\nThese are some suggestions for 'opening gambits' during the first\nstressful few minutes of an exam.\n1. Relax before looking at your exam paper for a few minutes to\norganise thoughts. This is basic relaxation. Enter, sit and relax.\n2. 'Scribbling technique': this is a sort of rote learning which you do\nimmediately upon entering the examination. Outside the exam hall,\nyou are revising last minute details which are on a piece of A4 paper\nor 6 x3 cards. The information on these last minute aids must be\nordered, structured to be easily remembered. Immediately as you\nenter the hall (having thrown your cards away... don't cheat) rewrite\nthese ordered notes fast and first, without looking at the actual\nexamination paper. This maximise s short-term recall, and gives you\na feeling of a slight-edge, and control.\n3. Timetabling and reading through the questions. Spend some time\nreading through the questions. Spend some time reading through\nthe question and then write down your timetable for doing the\nquestions you have chosen.\n4. Ritual behaviour. This is one way of relaxing, being 'mindless', and\nmay consist in putting your bits and bobs in order, tieing your\nshoes, whatever ritual behaviours you normally do to get ready and\nrelax yourself.\n5. Unplanned contingencies (these are things which could go wrong,\nunanticipated occurrences). Accept that you will have instructions\nand give in to them, at least for a limited period. If for example,\nduring the exam you feel like daydreaming, give in to it, saying to\nyourself, 'I'm going to daydream', but only let yourself go for a few\nminutes. If you feel a severe anxiety attack then understand what is\nhappening and let it happen. Tell yourself something like' This is\nan anxiety attack. This means that there is a rush of adrenal in pumping through my system which will subside in a little while'. The\npsychology behind this strategy is that it will need to take its\nphysiological course but since you know what it is and have told\nyourself what it is, then you are still in control. The attack will pass,\nand you will be able to get on with the exam.\nAnxiety reveals itself in various physiological symptoms; dizziness,\nrapid heart beat, sweating, breathing over hard, nausea or vomiting,\ndefecation or urination, tension, muscle spasms. If you know that these\nsymptoms are signs of anxiety then you can control them. Anxiety\nstates are not in themselves detrimental, but should be kept in control.\nSo if possible, give yourself a mock exam, get the feel of the adrenal in pumping through your system, know what it is, and then practice\nrel a/ ing\nSome places in double rooms are available in flats close to Gloucester Rd. Tube. Anyone interested in moving in next week should contact Michael Arthur( In t2898) or go to the Welfare Centre,3 rd floor Union Building. "

A1 per cent rise for April was put on but\nlater halved.\nPrice rises to compensate for food price inflation will still go ahead\neach month and a4 per cent price rise put on in March will remain.\nA full discussion ofthe wages regulator will take place at Refectory\nCommittee on 3rd May and the Union will argue for smaller increases\nthan College has proposed.\nAs a result the Union Executive called off the boycott from Monday and yesterday's Union meeting accepted their decision without\nopposition. The meeting agreed with Mary Attenborough that it was\nnow more important to concentrate on improving quality. There will\nbe discussions about the installation of a cook freeze system.\nThe Union will also go ahead with participation in the College's Meet-IC day. Cooperation had been threatened as part ofthe Union's action on refectory prices.\nThe meeting also passed a motion proposed by Mary Attenborough\nthat the Union should look into the possibility of providing its own\ncheap snack bar. This suggestion arose out ofthe students experience in\nproviding alternative food during last term's boycotts.\nNEWS IN BRIEF\nJEN'S NEW ROLE Jen Hardy Smith, one of the\nUnion's five permanent staff\nmembers, will in future be known\nas the Union Administrator\ninstead of the Assistant to the\nPresident.\nJen joined the Union staff in\n1973 and has served under six\ndifferent Presidents ensuring a smooth changeover each year.\nTHREE GOTO PARIS\nThree IC students are in Paris\nthis week to attend the 4th European Conference of Students\nof Technology. The conference\nenables students from different\ncountries to exchange ideas about\nthe teaching of technological\nsubjects.\nThe three students, whose visit\nis financed by IC Union, arc\nAcademic Affairs Officer Roger\nStotesbury, Me chEng Departmental Representative Adam Kingdom, both elected by IC Union Council, and City and\nGuilds Academic Affairs Officer\nBob Hart.\nFEES RISE - NO SURPRISE The Government has announced tuition fee increases\naveraging 9 1/2 per cent for the\nyear 1979/80, bringing the\nhighest rate, that for overseas\npostgraduates, to over\u00a31000. The\ndifferential fees charged to home\nand overseas students have been\nretained.\nThe new fees are \u00a3595 (\u00a3545 in\n1978/79) for home undergraduates, \u00a3770 (\u00a3705) for\noverseas undergraduates, \u00a3890\n(\u00a3805) for home postgraduates\nand \u00a31010 (\u00a3925) for. overseas\npostgraduates.\nImperial College Governors\nwill discuss the new fees at a meeting of their Finance and\nExecutive Committees on 25th May. The Union will lobby the\nGovernors in support of its\ndemand.\nCaptain Lindln, organiser of \"Meet-IC\" Photo by Colin Palmer\nBEER UP Beer prices are up by 2pa ji in t this term following a price rise by\nthe brewers. Mary Attenborough\nis investigating whether the rise is\nfully justified. The Bar accounts\nfor last January show a surplus of\n\u00a314,500 for the previous six\nmonths representing 12.3 percent\nof turnover.\nMARY IN SWEDEN Alter yesterday's Union meeting President Mary Attenborough was in a hurry to\nleave as she had a plane to catch.\nShe was taking up an invitation\nto visit Chalmers University in\nGothenburg, Sweden, to\ncelebrate the 75th Anniversary oi\nthe founding of Chalmers University Students' Union. She\nwill be away until Wednesday.\nIC has academic links with\nChalmers which sends a group of\nstudents in the 4th year of their\ndegree course to attend M.Sc. courses at IC. There are about 15\nChalmers' students here this year.\nChalmers' Rector was made an\nhonorary fellow of IC at the last\nCommemoration Day. While visiting the College he came into\ncontact with IC students in their\nmost down-to-earth state when he\nentered the Union Bar wearing a dinner jacket and was greeted by\nthe comment l ing dinner\njackets.\nGRANTS UP 13 PER CENT London undergraduates are to\nrecieve \u00a31,485 next year in a13 per cent grant award announced\nearlier this month, but there is to\nbe no change in the means test.\nThis means that the majority of\nstudents will, continue not to\nreceive the full grant because\nmost parents do not pay the full\namount of the parental contribution.\nThe increase awarded is less\nthan half the 27 per cent\ndemanded by the Nation Union of Students. Another NUS demand lor grants for 16 to 19\nyear old students has also been\nignored.\nEducation Secretary Shirley\nWilliams in her announcement of\nthe new grant rates said that the\nGovernment had been prevented\nfrom responding to the NUS proposals because of the General\nElection, but major changes\nwould be considered in the\ntriennial grants review of\n1980/81.\nThe home grant rate goes up to\n\u00a3985 from \u00a3870 and the full grant\nfor students outside London goes\nup to \u00a31245 from \u00a31100. The Government has promised similar\nincreases for postgraduates.\n\n"

Abortion and Homosexuality\nIn reply to the letter on the facing page I would like to explain why I closed correspondence on both the above topics at the end of last term.\nThe discussions had been running for several weeks (since issue 508 in\nthe case of abortion) and I had received many requests to terminate the\ndebate. Far from acting un democratically I felt that the vast majority\nwere fed up to the back teeth with the topic being discussed by the same\nfew. Matters of this nature are questions of religion, ethics and personal\nbelief, and as such cannot be proved. If anyone feels sufficiently strongly\nthey can always take the matter up privately with the individuals\nconcerned.\nI would like to know where it says I was \"elected not to censor but lo set\".\nAs far as I'm concerned I was elected to edit which means using my\njudgement in selecting copy for publication.\nUrgently Wanted\nBack issues of the following copies of FELIX are desperately needed\nfor our files.

Names to Jen in the Union Office, (int 3915) by\n1.00pm Tuesday May8 th. THE CROQUET SAGE\n\"Mr President, what has your administration\ndone about one of the vilest and most\npervasive problems to afflict our great and\nglorious nation today, a plague to which a large section of our youth has already\nsuccumbed? I am, of course, referring to\ncroquet abuse.\"\nThe president started sweating. This had\nbeen the making of three ex-presidents\nalready, and he did not want to join his\ncompatriots in the past tense.\n\"Well....\"\nMeanwhile, somewhere in Katmandu a man was transacting what could become the\ngreatest deal of his life. He had just bought\nthe largest shipment of illicit croquet\nequipment ever. This deal would mean an\nearly retirement to Miami Beach.\nOf course, there was always the minor\nmatter of the CEA( Croquet Enforcement\nAdministration), but bribes would go a long\nway towards solving that ...\nMeanwhile, in a dark, dingy room in the\nwilds of St John's Wood a young man was\nslowly dying from the effects of his addiction.\nHe had started it all for kicks, but it had soon\nbecome a habit, which had forced him to\nsteal, lie, cheat, mug little old ladies and fiddle\nhis income tax forms ...\nMeanwhile, in police HQ a band of loyal\ncitizens was being given lectures on how to\nrecognise addicts. The sergeant held up a stubby wooden object.\n\"Right, this is a croquet mallet, and it is\nused for hitting these things called balls.\"\nHe paused, as the shock registered on the\nfaces of his audience. A responsive audience\nwas always a nice thing to have.\n\"Now I want to warn you all. This is a very\nsordid business. If you can't stand the sight of\nraw mallets you had better leave, before I show you the hoops\"\nSomebody had to be carried out from the\nback row...\nMeanwhile, back at the ranch, the tourists\nhad finally arrived. But they were no ordinary\ntourists. They were important, underworld\ncroquet pushers. Representatives from the\nCommunist International were there too.\nThey passed by the sacrosanct croquet pitch,\nsurrounded by an electrified fence. Inside\nthere were would be almost half a ton of balls\n(Yucch!) ...\nMeanwhile, in a tenement basement in\ndowntown Manhattan a young man was\nbowing down to a bronze statue of a croquet\nplayer. He firmly believed that the Messiah\nwould be a croquet grand master. The door\nburst open. Two policemen, foaming at the\nmouths, beat him to a joyful pulp with his own\nmallets, before driving a steak through his\nheart (well done). There was a lot of\ndiscontent in the police force because the\ncourts tended to apply croquet legislation\nrather leniently. One of the cops spat.\n\"Who was he?\"...\n\"I don't know, I just came to use the John\"...\nMeanwhile, in a rickety plane over a rickety\nAmerican border, a rickety man was fighting\nfor his rickety life (rick et ily).A storm was\nrick et ting the buffett y plane. He swore to\nhimself that if he could get this shipment\nthrough alive, he would give up chewing gum\nfor a year. But a flash of lightening sheared\nthe tail rickets off the rickety plane. The\nplummet ty plane began rick et ting and ...\nMeanwhile in suburbia.\n\"Mom, I... can you take a shook... Well, I 'ni\ner...\"\n\"Oy vay, Allah protect us (and a hey non ny non ny) don't tell me you're ...\"\n\"Yes, I'm pregnant.\"\n\"Ahh! Thank the Lord. For a moment I thought you were a cro qui e.\" \"Oh, that-as well\"\n\"Fee, ooh, ah ...\"\nMother drops dead ...\nMeanwhile, back on a plummet ty, rick e ting plane a few metre* above the ground.\n\"Oh my God, I think I'm catching rickets\".\n(Dies)\nTons of croquet equipment were destroyed.\nMeanwhile, back at the brothel... Oh, sorry,\nwrong magazine ...\nMeanwhile, Fred was walking through the\nPark under the watchful gaze of a poster\nproclaiming the evils of croquet.\n\"KICK THE CROQUET,\nYOU'LL BE O.K.\" Suddenly two big schwarz ers loomed up in\nfront of him and knocked him into the ground\n(with a mallet) took his money and hearing\naid and ran.\n\"Ee, ooh, a ah\", he said, \"Just my luck to run\ninto cro qui es\".( stay alive).\nMeanwhile.\n\"Of course, all modern science says that\ncroquet is no more harmful than smoking,\ndrinking and group sodomy. Moreover we\nhave found that it is not possible to stem the\ngrowing tide by force or even nasty means.\nEven free collective bargaining has failed.\n\"So, dear Congress, I 've decided to do the\nonly thing possible... No problem is so great\nit can't be run away from, so I'm going to\nintroduce legislation to make croquet playing\ncompulsory. In future the country's emblem\nwill be an eagle clutching a croquet mallet.\nVoters will have to be accomplished players.\"\nCamera fades out on dazzling grin. Thinks.\n\"Got out of that one O.K.\" There now follows a message from the first\ncroquet mallet on the moon.\n\"Yippee! I'm the first croquet mallet on the\nmoon\"...\n\n"

Welfare to V.P. Services. The major upset\nof the elections occurred when Mike Goodman( Pres Brunei)\ndefeated John Merry( B.L.: not British Leyiand though one\nwonders at times) for V.P. Education.\nConference opened with T. Phillips condemning the 13% rise as too\nlittle and describing the lack of coordination in the D.E.S. The serious content of conference consisted of debate on\nConstitutional changes, the Exec report and a short period towards the\nend for emergency motions.\nIn the Constitution debates proposals were presented by the\nConstitutional Review Body ( CR B) with numerous amendments from\nthe Constituent Organisations, many of which were not debated, much\nto the dissatisfaction of many present. The most contentious subjects\nwere structure and Elections, Part time Student Membership, Finance\nand Subscriptions and Women.\nThe Structure of NUS will continue to be con federal ie. a3 tier\nsystem of NUS, COs and students, rather than a National Union of\nindividuals as proposed by the Tories who were also in favour of\nnationwide elections for NUS posts.\nPart time students will be represented in a10:1 ratio to full time\nstudents as part of a phased introduction. Postgraduates will be\nconsidered as a separate group and will have their own conference.\nWomen will have two conferences, one open / one closed as opposed to\nthe present single open conference. This was also opposed by the Tories\n(They had a monopoly on Amendment 1 to most motions).\nThe major defeat on the constitution was the new finance and subscriptions Motion which proposed to increase the poly tc ch. sub and\nnot surprisingly was opposed by them.\nThe Emergency Motions on the last day had little time and only two,\nGrants and Cuts and Overseas Students, of the four prioritized were\ndebated and were predictable although very necessary.\nConference finished with an hour of self-indulgence and all dispersed\ntired.\nOverall it was personally a worthwhile although exhausting\nexperience and would gladly be repeated. Ah!,I forgot the Liberals but\nnever mind. John Passmore Acting E AO and part time UL U observer.\nParliamentary Candidates\nand Gay Rights\nLast summer when everyone thought there would be a general election in October, I wrote to the Party leaders and\nvarious prospective Parliamentary Candidates to discover\ntheir opinions on Gay Rights.\nMy letter asked about their attitudes to the following:\n(1) The legal age ol consent should be the same for homosexuals as\nfor heterosexuals (i.e.16). Male homosexual relationships are\ncompletely illegal in Scotland and Northern Ireland and illegal in\nEngland and Wales for all people aged under 21. Since everyone can\nvote at 18 and get married under 18. it is outrageous that the law does\nnot consider men and women aged 20 sufficiently mature to determine\ntheir own relationships without its intervention.\n(2) Women and men should have the right to freedom from all discrimination (e.g. in employment, ac como dati on) resulting from\neither being gay, openly gay (e.g. wearing badges at or outside work), or\nactively gay (e.g. participating in demonstrations or joining political,\nsocial or e ou neel ling gay organisations).\n(3) Lesbianism should not be used as justification either for\npresenting custody of children being granted to their mother or for\nrefusing A. I.I).( Artificial Insemination by Donor) to lesbians,\n(4) \" Privacy\", \"Indecency\", and \" Soliciting\" should be defined so\nthat homosexual conduct would not be prosecuted where comparable\nheterosexual acts would not be an ol fene e.(5) Literature and advertising directed to homosexual women and\nnun should not be prosecuted where similar material directed to\nheterosexual men and women would not be liable to prosecution.\n(()) There should be an end to the harassment of gays by police (e.g.\" recent raids on gay clubs and pubs particularly in London and Manchester; such raids rarely result in prosecution but merely threats\nof prosecution which have caused several clubs to close).\n(7) The ban on Gay News, the fortnightly gay newspaper, by W.H. Smith should end. In many parts ofthe country W.H. Smiths were the\nsole distributor of Gay News which is a lifeline for many isolated gay\nmen and women.\n(8) The. conviction against Gay News in the 'Blasphemy Trial',\ninitiated by Mary Whitehouse, which resulted in fines totalling\u00a31500,\nshould be quashed when it is reconsidered in the House of Lords in the\nnear future.\nThe replies received were as follows:\nPARTY LEADERS Jim Callaghan, Labour Party opted out and did not reply but sent\nthe letter to various Government Departments including the Home Office, Northern Ireland and Scottish Office, and the Department of\nHealth and Social Security. The Home Office said that the law of\nblasphemy would be looked at by the Law Commission during a review\nof offences against religion and public worship. On other issues of law,\nthe Policy Advisory Committee on Sexual Offences was supposed to be\nlooking at possible areas of change although at that time (24 August),\nthe Government had no plans to change the law.\nThe Northern Ireland Office and Scottish Office both said that\nattempts were being made to bring their laws on the matter into line\nwith England and Wales. The Scottish Office said that although\nhomosexual acts between consenting males were illegal in Scotland\nthere had not been any prosecutions.\nMaggie Thatcher, Conservative Party. Gave a short reply that she\nwas not interested in extending the law on any of the subjects\nmentioned.\nDavid Steel, Liberal Party, said that his general stance was that\nthere, should be no discrimination against homosexuals, and he\nenclosed a resolution from the Liberal Party Council supporting a Homosexual Law Reform Bill promoted by the Campaign for\nHomosexual Equality (C.H.E.). LOCAL CONSTITUENCIES City of London and Westminster South\nConservative Party Candidate - Peter Brooke supports gay rights\nalthough he felt some of the points in my letter were not matters for\nlegislation.\nLabour Party Candidate - Russell Proffit. Supports gay rights and\nthinks there should be a law against discrimination because of sexual\norientation. He sees the issue as related to the way rights are denied to\nothers, such as Blacks.\nLiberal Party Candidate - Harry Ball Wilson. Supports most of the\nchanges suggested in my letter and that it should be unlawful to\ndiscriminate in matters such as housing and employment on grounds of\nsexual orientation.\nKensington Constituency\nLiberal - no reply\nLabour Ann Holmes said she was very firmly committed to the light\nfor homosexual equality and said that there should not be a definition of\nheterosexuality as 'normal' and homosexuality behaviour as\n'abnormal'. As a comment about police behaviour she supported\ngreater accountability of the police force.\nChelsea Constituency\nLabour no reply\nLiberal - Peter Driver agreed with gay rights and called for greater\npolice understanding of minority rights.\nConservative - Nicholas Scott sent an acknowledgement only (but\nC.H.E. inform me that he is a supporter of gay rights).\nI hope that these attitudes on gay rights will aid you in your decision\non how to vote in the General Election.\nMary Attenborough\nPresident I.C.U.

These\nprotests lead to the death of\nover a thousand of the\ndemonstrators and persuaded Mahl an gu to leave\nSouth Africa and train as a freedom fighter with the\nAfrican National Congress\n(ANC).\nHe and two companions\nreturned lo SA in June 1977 and\nwere intercepted by police in\nJohannesburg and a running\nbattle ensued. Mahlangu and\nanother escaped but the third.\nMondy Motloung. was cornered\nin a warehouse where he killed\ntwo whites before being captured.\nMahlangu was detained later\nwhen trying to find out what\nhappened to Motloung. As a result of injuries sustained after\nhis arrest, primarily a fractured\nskull. Motloung was declared\ninsane as a result of brain damage\nand was unable to stand trial.\nThus Mahlangu. a youth of 21.\nwas left to stand trial alone. For\nhis part in these events he was\nsentenced to death, even though\nhe had nt personally been involved in any killing (though no\ndoubt he was prepared to be).\nThis sentence was carried out on\nthe 30 March this year.\nI first became aware of this\nscenario when I was dragged\nalong to the South African\nembassy by a certain Ms Att... (to\nhold the other end of the ICU banner) on the Wednesday before\nthe execution was scheduled, and\nI subsequently attended an all\nnight vigil at the same embassy\nthe following night Friday morning. The purpose of this\nprotest was to try and persuade\nthe S A government to abandon\nthis execution, which we failed. I also expect that this protest has\nahead) been forgotten by most\npeople bar the demonstrators and\nthe 50 plus policemen women\nwho kept us company but I can-hope that my illiterate ramblings\nmight remind some of you.\nOne disturbing point about this\nprotest was that while we were\nsupposed to be appealing against\nthe execution of one person, the\nANC faction was leading us in\nchants along the lines;\nWho do we want? ... Vorster\nHow do we want him?...\ndead!!!\nOn the other hand however, at\n5am, the time of the execution,\nafter the traditional moment of\nsilence, we were treated to a talk\nby some official of the ANC who\nafter giving us the usual state of\nwar and just struggle bit went on\nto promise that any South African\nsoldiers captured by ANC forces\nwould be treated as POWs in\naccordance with the Geneva\nGonventions (International Red Cross, 1949). He then challenged\nthe S A government to treat ANC prisoners the same.\nThis is where the value judgement creeps in! The question that has to be\nanswered here is: At what point (if\nany) does terrorism evolve into a just struggle against oppression?\nand the complementary question:\nWhat circumstances, (if any)\nwarrant the execution, of\nindividuals (citizens or otherwise)\nby a government?\nEven if I had any well formed\nideas about the answers to these\nquestions I would probably\nrefrain from airing them here but\nI can leave them for you to think\nabout as they are both rel event in\nthis country at the moment. The\nfirst governs our treatment of the\nIRA and similar organisations,\neg. Should the protesting prisoners in H Block be given\nPOW status? the second is highly\nrel event with the current resurgence of the campaign to\nreintroduce the death penalty\ninto British law.\nJust as a foot-note, probably\ntotally irrelevant to the rest of this\ndiscourse, is that a group of\nmourners at the graveside of\nMahl an gu were dispersed by\nsecurity forces with tear-gas, not\nbecause they were posing any\nthreat to those police but this\nwas simply the easiest way of\nbreaking up an illegal gathering,\nand act hardly endearing one to\nthe forces of order in South Africa.\nJohn S Whitehouse\nChemistry\nRAG FE TE SATURDAY5 th MAY PRINCES GARDENS We still nee i MORE stalls MORE helpers Meeting, Wed2 n d,6.30,Rag Office for details, or names to Graham Cox JX_JST JR.JL^.T~\\ fE FD iI CRAG T SHIRTS White with3 colour' Swan' logo \u00a3 2 . 5 0 from Union foyer Limited edition of100 so hurry!
