    "content": "Mike Williams\nIT WAS with some amusement that\na meeting of the Imperial College Union\nExecutive had pretentiously decided\n(not recommended, or advised) that the\nEditor of FELIX, having been elected\nas Editor cum Publicity Officer, shall\nin fact be Publicity Officer. It had\napparently gotten into their heads that\nthe Editor might refuse to adopt his\npublicity duties or some such tripe.\nTheir decision is as bad as Council\ndeciding that the President shall be\nthe head of the Union or that the Deputy\nPresident shall be responsible for the\nUnion building. I.e. the Executive\nwasted approximately two hours coming\nto an irrelevant decision. Nevertheless,\ntheir conscientious motivation for\ndiscussing such an issue can hardly be\nridiculed in the light of the experience\nthe Union has had with some of the\nmore recent Editors. Rather, it is to be\napplauded in as much they have the\ninterests of the Union at heart.\nIt is with immense regret that the\nEditor must announce the departure\nfrom the FELIX staff of Clive Dewey.\nHe has worked hard on the last two\nissues and was responsible for producing\nmany of the photographs therein. He\nalso made some creditable contributions\nto the Reviews Section.\nHowever, his association with\nFELIX reached flashpoint when it was\ndetermined that his outside interests\nand opportunist attitude were inappropriate for the job that was expected\nof him.\nFELIX would like to take this\nopportunity to wish him every success\nin establishing the Campus Radio.\nApologies are in order to all those\npeople who were offended by the front\npage of the Freshers' Issue of FELIX It is understood that a lot of people\ntook offence to what they saw. It had\nbeen promised by FELIX not to print\nsuch a thing, but at the last moment,\nthe Editor felt that he had no choice.\nThe Editor undertakes not to print such\na silly space-filler as 'FELIX\nWELCOMES FRESHERS' on the front\npage again.\nJO THEFTS\nAll Colleges are vulnerable in varying degrees\nto this problem and the\nopen plan nature of Imperial\nCollege presents difficulties\nof this kind. Cycles, including motor cycles, should\nbe secured with a strong\nchain and a stout padlock.\nPlastic covered cables, as\nsupplied by cycle dealers\nare quite inadequate for this\npurpose. If you value your\ncycle, you are advised to\ninsure it and don't forget to\nmake a note of the serial\nnumber on the frame.\nMoney and other valuables should be carried on\nthe person and not left in\njackets hanging on chairs\netc. in unattended rooms and\nlaboratories.\nLOST AND FOUND\nPROPERTY\nAll losses of personal\nproperty on the campus\nshould be promptly reported\nto the Security Office.\nPersons finding property on\nthe campus are asked to\nhand it in either to the\nSecurity Office or to one of\nthe messengers or security\nguards. Unidentifiable folders containing lecture notes\nare frequently handed in to\nthe Security Office so\nwould help the loser to\nrecover his property if his\nname and the name of his\nDepartment were written on\nsuch documents. Many items\nof found property are never\nclaimed by the losers which\nsuggests that students are\nunaware of the facilities\nprovided.\nMOTOR VEHICLES\nPlease don't bring your\nmotor car into the College\nCar Park unless you have\nbeen allocated a parking\nspace and don't leave It on\nthe campus until it becomes\nderelict. If you wish to\nleave your solo motor cycle\non the College premises\nplease put it in one of the\nauthorised places and register it by giving the appropriate details to the\nSecurity Officer.\nA.D.

This was the annual\nsummer trek of IC Dramatic Society (here in after known as Dramsoc)\nto an unsuspecting audience\nof children, dogs and OAPS in\nHampshire and Dorset.\nThe play, As You Like It,\nby our national play write, was presented in a glorious\ncollection of Edwardian costumes and a bicycle. However,\nmore interest was shown in the\nextra cum cula r activities, viz\nshopping in Woolies( Farnham),\nclipping Camden, eating cheese\nand pickle sandwiches (!),\nwalking to the needles (lOW), visiting Beaulieu and taming\nNew Forest ponies.\nThe stages varied in size\nfrom twelve feet (with lantern\nthrow of six inches) at Lymington to forty feet at Bryanston\n(not where the pickle comes\nfrom). Luckily several tall\nmembers of the cast were able\nto take the place of A frames\nat some schools so that the\nhanging of lanterns was but\nthe work of a moment. The\naudiences varied from seven\nhundred to twenty four( not at\nthe same performance) but\nexpressed great pleasure at\nsuch a polished performance.\nOne of the highlights of the\ntour was the annual cavort in\nLymington high street; this\ninvolved the entire cast \u2014 in\nfull costume rushing around\nTescos drumming up an audience and ended in the\ntraditional darts and drink in\nthe Anchor and Hope P.H. All accommodation was in\ntents and vans at various\ncampsites, fellow campers\nwere sup rise d to hear references\nto the Taj Mahal, the Hilton,\nthe Inn-on-the-Park, and the\nDorchester (as our tents,\nkindly loaned by ICYHA group,\nwere known).\nIf you want to find out what\nfun we masochists can get out\nof slaving away for a fortnight\nin the hot sun and under 5,000w arc lights, come and join\nDRAMSOC - at anytime on the\n2Vi floor in the north east\ncomer of the Union build j ng( go up the stairs past the Union\nOffice and you can't miss it).\n(P.S.

I feel I must warn you however, that\nthere are only 193 permits and\nI expect in excess of 600\napplications, so it would be\nfar wiser to leave your car at\nhome unless it is absolutely\nimpossible to do so. Please do\nnot bring your car into college\nuntil you have a permit because\nyou will not be allowed tt f part without one.\nIf you have a motorcycle\nyou do not need a permit, but\nyou must park only in the areas\nthat are specifically for motor-cycles.\nPlease be sensible about\nparking your vehicle, remember\nto think of other people!\nELECTIONS\nSeveral of the posts were\nnot filled last year, and several\nothers have become vacant due\nto exam failures. Nomination\npapers for these posts and for\nposts normally elected in the\nfirst term will be posted on\nthe Council noticeboard in the\nUnion Lower Lounge at the\nbeginning of term.\nIf you have any questions\nto ask about what the jobs are\nand what they involve, please\ncome into the Union Office and\nask me, or anyone else who\nis around.\nMEETINGS\nThe first IC Union General\nMeeting this year is on October\n8th at 1p.m. in the Great Hall,\nCollege Block. Decisions made\nwill affect you. Don't worry\nthat you may have a lecture at\n1.30p.m., because on Tuesdays\nand Thursdays each week\nlectures do not start til I2.30 p.m. Please come along and take\npart, decisions will be made\nthat affect you. Also John Carr\nVice President without Portfolio\nof NUS and President of UL U, should be coming along to\nspeak to the meeting.\nThese are just a few of\nthe points I have thought of,\nover the last couple of days .\nIf you have any further problems\nplease come and ask someone.\nRC C VANS We would like to remind prospective drivers\nof the vehicles that on Wednesday October 9th, they must be fully registered:\n1. Have satisfactorily completed a driving test\nin one of the vehicles.\n2. Have paid a \u00a35 security deposit.\nThose people who do not satisfy all these\nconditions will be removed from the drivers\nlist.\nI will be available to receive security\ndeposits any lunch time during the week.\nMurray Ward\nTizard 414.\nRAILWAY SOCIETY Open Introductory Meeting.\nTuesday 8th October at 5.40 p.m. in MECH. ENG. 664.\nFILMS:\u2014 London's Victoria Line\n'This is York'.\nNEW MEMBERS WELCOME\nNEW PARTICLES STUDIED\nName withheld at Author's request\nIN THE issue before last of ' FELIX', there was a report on the research work\nof Prof. A. Rahim concerning the newly\ndiscovered animal species ' PG'. In the same spirit, namely the popularisation of con tempor y science, we give\nhere the report by Dr. V.D. Vcoi, on his\ninterview with Prof. Sir R.Z. Ryle who\nonce upon a time (i.e. at 1/t) received\nthe Nobel Prize in Peace. Because of\nthe nature of the research work, some\nsecrecy has to be retained, and certain\nnames have been 'translated'. (The more\nintelligent readers, however, no doubt\ncan work out the real names).\nProf. Ryle is interested not in animals\nbut in particles. A lot of particles tia ve been known for a long time, examples\nbeing electrons, protons, and neutrons .\nIn the now classic paper published in\nProc. ICU, Prof. Ryle announced the\ndiscovery of yet another two new types\nof particles with entirely novel char-act eris tics. He named them 'ma on s' and\n'f eons' respectively.\nIt is well known that electrons, for\ninstance, can form stable pairs, in each\nof which the electrons have opposite\nspins. Pairing may also occur when\nma on s and f eons collide, but a pair will\nconsist of ama on and a fe on, and not\n(usually) of particles of the same kind.\nCertain 'strong interactions' are responsible for the affinity between ma on s and f eons. However, until now even Prof.\nRyle has not been able to write down the\nexact equations for !';<? interaction laws,\nand it cannot be explained why a given\nfe on will pair with certain ma on s but not\nthe other ma on s, and vice versa, which is\nwhat has been observed.\nA pair of ma on and fe on is unstable.\nAfter a while they will either become\ndisassociated again or if not get into an\nexcited state together. In the latter case,\"\nthe excitation energy can increase until\nthe particles mutually penetrate the\nother's potential energy barrier, generating\na high-rank tensor field and a resulting\nhigh-energy kinetic resonance:\n(G/(EE oi G/2)) \u00bb oo .\nApproximately 3.62 + 0.03 GeV are\ndissipated by the resonance process\n(which is irreversible and generates\nthermodynamic entropy), and the particles\nget de-excited exponentially, with the\nma on usually having a shorter time-constant.\nProf. Ryle told Dr. Vcoi that he and\nhis research students are working on the\nfurther elucidation of the properties of\nma on s and f eons. In particular, he is very\ninterested in the strong interactions\nmentioned above, a better understanding\nof which he believes, will greatly advance the frontier of human knowledge\n(and experience).\n\n"
