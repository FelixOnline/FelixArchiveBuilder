Apologies but the\nfilm is indisputably a remix of WW11 dogfight scenes, themes first\narticulated in Star Trek (ST for short), Star Wars (SW) special effects\nand noise levels and Barbarella fantasy.\nViewed as anything other than bluish disposable entertainment the\nfilm falls flat on its back. As a big budget super glossy exercise in\nperfection and escapism it fails abysmally. The plot contains the most\nincredible faults - what Sam Goldwyn did for the English language,\nJustin P Zlanzazywyz or something , the Producer, has done for\nHollywood. Example: Almost the en tir it y of humanity have been\ndestroyed. A handful of survivors remain, barely able get the hell out of\nthe Solar System. The enemy, the Silos, wish to destroy every last\nhuman, so what do the survivors do? You guessed, they lead the enemy\ndirectly to the last remaining human colony - Starbase 69 (I said it was\nbad did I not?) - which is only rumoured to exist, and is almost certainly\nunarmed.\nUnlike SWs, where a great deal\nof thought went into the technic i alfea s abilities, this film uses money\nand little thought. The result is a string of hilarious mistakes which\nwhen briefly listed cover a side of\nA4. Here are some prime examples : Two of our fighter craft\n( which look a little like Thunderflash jet fighters) are\nrunning away from thousands of\nenemy fighters (no low budget\nfilm, this) at least half the velocity\nof light, when they decide to take\nevasive action - reverse thrust -and fully reverse in a fraction of a second. Do that in a mere\nsupersonic jet, or a Saturn V, and\nyou would leave the cockpit in\nmatchboxes.\nThere are of course the\nstandard errors - apparently\ninterstellar vacuums carry the\nsound of explosions very well.\nFighter ships, battlestar s and even\nwhole planets, alright, one little\none, explodes, Why? Well, you see this small inter gala tic craft\ncapable of withstanding attacks\nfrom massed perspex tubes\nwith lightbulbs in the ends, gets a little close to the planet, and well\nyou see, these big bolts of\nlightening shoot to and fro, and\nthen it sort of explodes taking the\nplanet with it - I suppose the\nplanet was called Krypton.\nThe film is slightly entertaining,\nbut even watching it through\nseveral cans of Swan and pints of\nRuddles I was mildly i rita ted and\ndisgruntled throughout the film.\nThe producer relied too heavily on\ntwo things - effects and the\nband wag gon. To some extent the\nfilm is sold on its technical merits\nalone - sound in 'Gropearound'\n(copyright) and Dooley 'A' Noise\nCreation System, filmed in\nWidevision. The next step will be\nNoise by Zappa' or some equivalent - already cinemas are\nissuing disclaimers( the, management accept snores pons ability for any physic i al effects caused by Gropearound...,\nand that is a quote).\nRemember the days when\nTechnicolour was a means to and\nend rather than a mean end in\nitself? The spin offs associated\nwith the film would amaze even\nsnooker club - the book, the home\nmovie, the film behind the scenes,\nthe sound track, the Battleship\nCar Headlights (why settle for less\nthan eight? Dazzle your friends...), the imitation radio\ncommercials and, of course, the\ncomputer program e of the film\n(algorithm to detect its use\navailable. Contact ICCC.)\nThings are not all bad - true the\nbaddies were. They forgot their\nlines, missed cues, ham act and\nprobably belong to trade unions -seriously though, there is a light at\nthe end of the perspex tube.\nDespite this film being seen in the\nWest End, on a Saturday, the\ncinema was 2/3 empty - too many\nrip offs have achieved saturation\nlevel. Star Wars 2 may do well,\nbut its imitators will not. Not even\nEmanuell Meets The Wookie, a novel idea. In retrospect it\nbecomes clear that Star Trek was\nof a high standard, even if there\nwere only three basic plots.\nReview by Honker Fenning.\nAnswers to Film Quiz: l. Neil Simon.

In\nfact they disbanded last July, yet\nhere is a new Tubeway Army album. Confusing, eh? Well perhaps until you realise that the\nArmy is really Gary Num an who\nsings and plays all the instruments\nexcept drums (his uncle Jess\nLibya rd) and bass ( Paul Gardiner).\nThe album cover, which finds\nNum an, bleached hair, black nail\npolish and make-up, staring at his\nown reflection is a dark window,\npoints to the musical direction -alienation - and the track listing\nconfirms it; 'Praying to the Aliens'\nand T Nearly Married a Human' are but a couple. But is it good?\nWell, no. Some of it is\nexceptional, but as a whole it\ncomes across like some cheap\nimitation of 'low' Bowie or early\nKraftwork.\nThe standout material is on the\nfirst side; ' Me!I Disconnect from\nYou' combines synthesis er fanfares and chanting vocals\nexcellently and is followed by the\nbest track on the album, ' Are 'Friends' Electric?', the current\npicture disc single. A lonely man\npleas for help; 'low know I hale lo\nask / Bui are friends electric:'\nOnly mine's broke down I And now\nI 've no-one to love.'\nI really can't enthuse too much\nabout this. So then the album\nstarts with two fine tracks both\nfilled with melodic keyboards,\nunnerving vocals and a fine\nrhythm backing. So why doesn't it last? I don't know, ask Gary.\nThe problem with many of the\nother songs is that they sound too\nmuch alike, though 'Praying to\nthe Aliens' stands out, with its\nstrange view of the future. It's one\nof the few cuts which, while\naiming for a specific effect, doesn't get bogged down in the process.\nNum an writes of machines and\nalienation, and then complains\nthat people ignore him. Well, my\nlad, maybe we're just not ready\nfor it. All this said, it's a valiant\nattempt, brave even on the part of\nhis record company, Beggar's Banquet. The music retains the\nchilling starkness which it strives\nfor, but somewhere along the line\nit falls de spar at ely short.\nJon Firth 'Gimme Some Neck' - Ron Wood\n(CBS)\n'Gimme some Neck' is Ron Wood's third solo album to date,\nand with a history as impeccable\nas his, (he has played with bands\nsuch as; the Birds, Creation, Jeff\nBeck Group, Faces and now the\nStones), it is only natural that\ngreat things are expected of this\nalbum. Add to that the line-up of\nbig names, such as Mick Jagger,\nKeith Richards and Charlie Watts\nfrom the Stones, Mick Fleetwood\nfrom Fleetwood Mac plus an ex-member of the Faces and a handful of other equally well\nqualified musicians, anything\nshort of excellence from the\nalbum would be d is app pointing. However, disappointing the\nalbum certainly is not. Listening\nto the album just once was\nenough to persuade me that if Mr\nWood gives a concert in the near\nfuture, I shall be one of the first to\nrush out for tickets.\nTo be chosen as lead guitarist\nfor the Rolling Stones, who have\nevery right to be particular about\nwhom they choose to join them,\nmust say something about the\nquality of Ron Wood's guitar\nplaying.\nSide One opens with a track\nheavily featuring honky-to nky piano and powered by Charlie\nWatts hammering away in his own\ninimitable style it is a typical\nexample of the fine rock featured\non the Album, most of the songs,\nin true Stones style, are built\naround a framework of slashing\nguitar chords, setting the rhythm,\nbacked up by a very strong\npercussion section. Indeed Gimme Some Neck' sounds like it\ncould almost be the latest offering\nby the Rolling Stones, with the\nexception of a couple of tracks.\nThe most obvious exception,\nbeing one of three of the eleven\nsongs not written by Wood, is\n'Seven Days' which was written by\nBob Dylan especially for the\nrecord. Ron Wood manages to\nsing it sounding more like Dylan\nthan Dylan usually does; couple\nthat with the drumming coming\nfrom Mick Fleetwood, the drummer for Fleetwood Mac and\nyou end up with a thoroughly\nsatisfactory song, probably the\nstrongest on the whole album.\nAnother track worthy of\nparticular scrutiny is ' FU C her', a witty, rather crude but nevertheless amusing look at the\nattitude of someone who, it -seems, has been snubbed by an\nattractive lady, and is trying to\nwarn others about her dubious\nintegrity. Here's part of the\nchorus:\n...'A COC teaser - an ice-cream\nsqueezer,\nHer CUN really do you in,\nSo don't try to FUC her if I wouldn't touch her with mine....'\nProbably the only fault with this\nalbum is that although the content\nis very sound, the music played\nand sung remarkably expressively there are so many bands\nplaying this sort of rock so well\nthat to produce a chart-topping\nrecord it must be a compilation of\nclassics, or have a million selling\nname attached.\n\n"

    "content": "Dear Sir, - I was amazed and\nsup rise d, etc, to read in last week's Snooker club article that Kit Nair\nnot being a committee member\nwas the best thing to happen to\nsnooker Club in a long time.\nWhat has this poor creature done\nthat Mr Teelock, Sanjit,\nPresident (2nd class) should\nvictim is e him so?\nOn a more serious note, I was\nglad to see under Rag that next\nyears minor charities will include\nAlcoholics anonymous rather\nthan the national organisation,\nAlcoholics Anonymous. I personally welcome a move such\nas this, which will benefit the\naverage student, sell included.\nYours sinecure ly, KJ Fenning.\nPhysics, sort of.\nP.S. Justin Newland could make a fortune writing American TV. Dear Sir, - On behalf of India!\nSociety I would like to condemn I the attitude of the Independent!\nObserver who wrote about India\nSoc Elections (FELIX, 8th June).\nThe observer, though well-informed in some aspects, wrote\nabout events which occurred\nthree weeks ago. The situation\nhad changed considerably by the\ntime he wrote his letter.\nAfter the elections there was\nstill an outstanding post in the\ncommittee. Mr Purewal stood for\nand was elected to that post after\nwhich the situation was back to\nnormal.\nThe 'Independent Observer'\napparently did not care enough\nto find out what was happening.\nIt seems to me that all he has\nsucceeded in doing is stirring up\ntrouble amongst society members\nintentionally or otherwise. He did\nnot even have the courage to write\nhis letter openly.\nYours faithfully,\nA Gujral, (Sec)\nIndia Soc.\nDear Sir, - I was disgusted and\nappalled on reading a letter about India Soc elections, written in bad\ntaste, by a self-styled independent\nobserver, since the contents of the\nletter clearly reveal that the\nperson who wrote the letter was\ncompletely biased. I utterly refute\nhis claim of'independence', since\nI know that the author of the\nletter is Mr Vinodh Dhanak\n(Chem) who has made an issue of\nthe election out of personal\nanimosity.\nImmediately after the election,\nI admitted defeat but soon\nafterwards some of my supporters\npointed out that the two persons\n(who were supporters of Mr Chakravarty) who did the\ncounting had deliberately\ncounted wrongly. It occurred to\nme that this was a distinct\npossibility.\nMy supporters suggested I should get signatures of people\nwho were dissatisfied with the\nway the election was conducted.\nThe motive for obtaining signatures was to register a protest\nnot to force a re-election. I could\nhave forced a re-election since I had more than enough signatures.\nThe nameless observer likes to\ncower in the security of his\nanonymity. If he had the guts he\nwould have revealed his identity.\nSincerely yours,\nSatinder Purewal\nChe mEng Dear It,\nI feel I must correct the errors in\nSonia Hochlelder's correction of\nRich Archer's errors last week.\nFirstly, (to take the points in the\norder she took them) the motion\ndid not mention the stripper, and\nif Chris Fox said that the motion\nwould 'probably' (Sonia's word)\nentail the exclusion of the\nstripper, then he was talking out\nol his arse as he commonly does\n(Hi! Chris). Rich was merely\nputting forward a statement of\nintent, namely to drag the\nSmoking Concert up out of the\nshit which I and my preceding\noil ice rs had allowed it to sink into.\nHe reckoned (quite rightly) that\nthe standard of sketches in recent\nyears has fallen far below the\nstandard acceptable to the\nUnion, and has decided that his\nway of getting decent entertainment value is to completely redesign the concert,\nstarting with the name. Though I disagree entirely with the name\nchange, I applaud his motives for\nproposing the motion, and wish\nhim great luck in his crusade\nagainst the rest of the world as\nEnts Supremo. To return to last\nweek's letter, if Ms. Hochfelder\nhad actually attended Smoking\nConcert, she may have noticed\nseveral pissed-up persons who\ncertainly tried to disrupt it,\nthough not through idealistic\nprinciples, but through straightforward cussed ness. We( meaning I) had no cause for\ncomplaint from the protesters. In\nfact I thought they behaved quite\nrestrained ly( actually I never saw\nthem). Is this a sign of paranoia?\nOh, and one other thing, isn't it\namazing how two people's memories of the same meeting\ndiffer? I am, of course, assuming\nthat our correspondent of last\nweek was actually present at it.\nYours,\nMick Maghar P.S.I bet the next line is 'This\ncorrespondence is now closed'\nDear John,\nMuch though I eschew continuous boring columns appearing in FELIX week alter\nweek, Iam prompted to reply to\nSonia Hochlelder's insane letter\nol last week, referring to Rich Archer's most commendable\nletter of the week before referring\nto Sonia's article of the week\nbefore that.\nFirstly, she complains that her\nreport did not say that the motion\nmentioned the stripper, this is\nhighly unlikely because it didn't, and anyway Rich agrees with\nthis. Also she complains about Mr Archer's interpretation of 'undemocratic minorities'. She\nseems to think that women\nprotesters were the only such\ngroup in Mr Fox's mind at the\ntime. If Sonia can divine Chris'\nthoughts, good for her. I see it\nonly as Rich trying to explain the\nchanges taking place.\nAgain Ms Hochfelder seems to\nthink that adequate reason for the\nname 'Headlights Revue' was not\ngiven. However, Rich Archer\nexplains at length the reasons for\nthe change. The name itself is sell-explanatory but perhaps Sonia\nhas no 'esprit de camara da rie' with our provincial colleagues.\nIn case anybody really is\nwondering to whom Rich is\nreferring when he said 'the people\nwho go to disrupt and drink free\nbeer', well I think he meant the\npeople who go to disrupt and drink free beer.\nFurther, I can detect no\nuntoward references to women\nprotesters in Rich A's letter, but I do detect bees in the Hochfelder\nBonnet, which seem to be the\nraison d'e tre of the whole letter.\nI do not mind people airing\ntheir (misguided) views in public\nexcept when they try to twist the\nmeanings ol a sensible person and\nthe views of a democratic body. In\nother words 'up yours'.\nSean O 'Boyle,\nR CSU President-elect\nDear John, I feel that I owe your\n'ace reporter' an apology. Whilst\nattending to my daily chores,\nsome time ago, she approached\nme and asked for interpretation\nof a motion passed by an R CSU Joint General Committee that I had seconded. (Un) fortunately,\nlike life itself, a motion passed by a caucus of nearly 50 is not without\nits ambiguities. This, combined\nwith my rather inept use of the\nEnglish language, led to Sonia's misunderstanding. I would like to\nclose with a fun but wouldn't know how to have pun.

In the belief that it might be both useful\nand enjoyable to meet from time to time, a small group arranged an\ninaugural dinner at the College in February 1979, the outcome of which\nwas the formation of the Huxley Club.\nThe objects of the Club are to establish and maintain contact between\nIC graduates now teaching and to create a closer and more abiding link\nbetween their schools and the College than otherwise exists.\nMembership is open to an ex-IC graduate or postgraduate now\nteaching. An Annual Dinner is to be arranged during the winter, usually\nin London, and in addition there will bea more informal gathering in the\nsummer outside London, at which guests are welcome (in June 1979\nthis took the form of a buffet luncheon at Clifton College, after which\nthose present were shown round the Science department).\nThere is no membership subscription, but an appropriate charge to\nthose attending is made to pay the cost of each function. Plans are now\nbeing made for the next Annual Dinner, to be held early in 1980, which\nwill probably take place at Dulwich College.\nAny ex-IC graduate or postgraduate now teaching, who would like to\njoin the Huxley Club is asked to write to the Chairman,\nMr David Rossell,\n21 Mallard Road,\nSelsdon Vale,\nSouth Croydon.\n(telephone 01-651 2819)\nThe Club would also like to be of assistance to any present IC\nstudents intending or contemplating a teaching career.

    "content": "^age 11\nc CRICKET IC SUNDAY XI 94 all out\nPRESIDENTS XJ 95 for 9\nAs usual the Sunday team was short of a player, thanks to\nTomlinson who did not appear due to an all-night party. Toplis\nhaving won the toss, much to his delight, elected to bat, but\nsoon regretted his decision. None of the recognised batsmen\nmade any significant contributions with the unfortunate\nToplis only managing to get his gloves to a rising ball which\nthen flew to slip. Price batted well despite his fetish for being\nhit on the feet by any ball which came near him, and this\nultimately led to his downfall being LB W at 45 and so stopping\nhim from buying a jug. After the departure of Price and his\nfaithful sidekick Vincent who put on 51 together, the tail\ncollapsed with the last 4 wickets putting on only 3 runs.\nThe miserable total was mainly due to the pedestrian bowling of\nformer IC cricket club captain Williams who finished with figures of 11\novers 10 maidens 5 for 5, the last victim being Heath who seemed\ndetermined to give Williams his 5th wicket and so enabled him to buy a jug. Shortly afterwards it was noticed that Miss Attenorough was\nreprimanded for drinking on licensed premises out of hours while\nshowing the Swedish visitors around Harlington, and then in spite,\nstopped Mel Kinki e making up the numbers in the field.\nChasing the rather ordinary\ntotal of 94 the Presidents XI got\noff to a great start with both\nopeners going for 0, Millard and\nToplis getting one apiece, the\nlatter due to a good catch from\nmake-shift wicket-keeper Care,\nthe only ball he managed to hold\nall afternoon. Millard and Toplis\nhogging the bowling steadily\nworked their way through the\nbatting until the hard-hitting\nJenkins arrived in the middle\nwhere he put on 20 with Perkins\nand 31 with a12 year old\nschoolboy S Weale. Both Millard and Toplis, their compassion\naroused, refused to get the\nyoungster out, so he promptly\nclipped the ball between the\ncluster of close fielders and then\nwhen Toplis finally allowed 2\novers from Price, hit him lor 4.\nWhen Jenkins was finally out for\nTeam: Mylvaganam, Slator, Toplis,\nChadband, Heath.\n37, thanks to a remarkable catch\nfrom Price despite the efforts of\nRoche, who looked determined to\nknock the ball out of his hands,\nonly 15 runs were needed. Weale S and Weale K, promptly knocked\nthese off although Weale S provided some excitement by\nbeing the 9th wicket to fall with\nthe scores level. With a magnificent chance to tie the\nmatch, Roche was unlucky to\nmisjudge a high chance which in\nfact led to the winning run. Toplis\nagain finished with 5 wickets, but\n\u2022 true to form declined to honour\nthe team with the customary\nliquid refreshment.\nWith the usual efficiency of the\nclub, the coach failed to arrive\nand so 1 hour after Toplis had left\nby car, the other weary members\nhad to make their own way home.\nMdlard, Care, Price, Vincent, Roche,\nIC 1st XI vs. St. Peters College\nCaptain-elect Price showed he possesses one of the\nnecessary qualities by getting us lost. This meant nine of us\narrived an hour late. This year's skipper, Toplis, and Slater\nmanaged to arrive even later.\nThis left Price to toss-up and remarkably he actually won and elected\nto bat. Morton and Myl van gana m opened and appeared to be coping\nwith a very tricky wicket before Filield gave Morton out LB W to a ball\nmissing leg stump by at least a foot. Fifield later admitted he was\nconsidering an appointment at the opticians. Thus IC's numerous\nsupporters (two) were deprived of the sight of IC's classiest batsman in\naction after he had scored only 18.\nMy1 van gana m fol1 owed Morton back to the pavilion\nshortly afterwards when he was\nwell caught in the gully with his\nscore on 10. Everett was looking\ngood at this stage and was joined\nby the lumbering hulk ol\nTomlinson to produce the ugliest\nbatting partnership since the\ndemise of D.A. Heath. Fortunately, Tomlinson didn't last long after scoring a marvellous one run. E^verett continued to carve up the bowling\nuntil the bowler held a good\nreturn catch to dismiss him lor 22.\nThis allowed Slater and Maguire\nto come together for an excruciatingly slow partnership.\nIt was so slow the 'old hands' in\nthe team couldn't help but\ncompare them with the legendary\nJohn England. Slater crawled to\nan impressive 5 before being\nbowled by a full toss. Maguire\nnow really came out of his shell\nand produced some text book\nedges to race to 15 when he was\nrun-out. This left Toplis to come\nin lor his normal heave-ho. He\nlasted a relatively long time (third\nball), but was then stumped for\nnought despite a brave Hurry of\nlimbs in an attempt to regain his\nground. Filield was caught\nbehind alter he bad accumulated\na similar total. Crowe was now\nresigned to hitting out and this led\nto him being stumped with his\nscore on five. Once again our last\npair were called in to save the day.\nOnce again they failed to do so.\nThis time Price let us down by\nskying a catch after failing to\nscore. Special mention should be\ngiven to Acford lor his 3 n.o. The\nsight of Brian running up the\npitch screaming 'three' brought\ntears to the eyes of all those\nsentimentalists in the team who\ntruly believed he would score-more than one run in an innings\nbefore this prolific bus-driver left\nCollege. Anyway we finished on a meagre 81.\nIC's opening bowlers were\nCrowe and Toplis. Toplis picked\nup two early wickets but he had to\nrely on stupendous diving catches\nIrom Everett and Morton. It is a sad reflection on our cricket club\nthat the whole team relies so\nheavily on these two as you will\nnote from the above that they had\nalready scored hall the runs. Avid followers of these reports will be\naware that IC possess a formidable (?) array of spin-bowlers. Today we had Slater.\nFilield and Price in action. As\nusual they gave away numerous\nruns to lose us the match. Fifield\nretained some honour by taking a wicket. The only other wicket to\nfall during this period of spin-bowling was again due to our\nresident super-heroes. Morton ran after a ball at the speed of\nsound, produced a throw to the\nwicket-keeper that travelled at\nthe speed of light and within a pie o second Everett had the bails\noil to run out their most\n.threatening batsman. When\nstaring defeat in the face, Toplis\nbrought himself back on and\nin tr duce d the inconsistent Acl'ord\nto the attack. These two bowled\nvery tidily and finished with\nfigures of 5 for 10 (but no jug) and\n1 for 7 respectively. This earned\nIC a draw as St. Peter's finished\non 63 lor 8.\nFive of us then stayed on lor the\nevening and had a great time, but\nthen who wouldn't with beer at\n25pa pint? It is with regret that I must report that Everett may\nhave looked good on the field but\nhe looks bloody awful when\nthrowing up in the streets of\nOxford. We must thank Brian lor\nstaying sober and driving us back\n& Tom for taking care of our less\nthan 100% lit wicket-keeper.\nROCK MINTON P.S. Neil Price stayed in Oxford\nthat night. I don't know what\nhappened to him but it inspired\nhim to unknown heights t he-following day in the Presidents'\nXI game.\nTennis Club On Sunday we played a ladies\ndoubles match against Southgale\nCounty LTC, it was a2nd round\nmatch in the Under 21 Middlesex\nCup. The match was away, and we\nhad to travel by tube to the far end\nof the Picadilly line. Lack of\nconfidence in the Captain's nava gat ional abilities soon\nshowed, we all refused to believe\nthat she knew where she was\ngoing. However, after visiting a golf course, we eventually arrived\nat the tennis club.\nIn the first match Kathy and\nHazel played the second couple\nand won 7-5, 6-1. They then had to\nsit and watch Sara and Julia finish\na slightly longer match against the\nfirst couple, in which Julia\namused the opposition by falling\nabout all over the court. Due to\nnerves and some pathetic tennis\nwe allowed them to reach a52 lead, we then played properly and\nwon the set on a tie- break. In the\nsecond set we played better, and\nwe beat them 7-6, 6-3.\nFor the second matches the\ntables were turned. Julia and Sara\nbeat the second couple easily, 6-2, 6-1 .while Kathy and Hazel were\nstruggling against the first couple.\nThe game went to three sets,\nmainly due to lack of concentration by both players, but we\neventually won 3-6, 7-6, 8-6. The\ncredit for the final victory must go\nto Hazel, as by the end of the third\nset Kathy was definately feeling\nthe effects of the previous nights\ntoga party.\nAltogether we won convincingly, dropping only one set in\nthe whole match. As we won this\nmatch we are now through to the\nquarter final of the Middlesex\nCup. Team:- Julia Towns and Sara\nMcGuinness; Kathy Snook and\nHazel McCulloch.\n\n"

Department of Health and Social Security Office,\nland2 are sometimes the same office.\nTo claim supplementary benefit ring 3. and make an appointment for\nan interview and then go to 1, 2, and 3, in that order.\nTo claim Unemployment benefit you goto1 and 2 but it is worth going\nto 3 as well so at least you get Supplementary Benefit if they refuse\nto give you Unemployment Benefit.\nIf you are not happy with the money that they give you you can, within\n21 days, write to them and tell them that you want to appeal.\nOVERSEAS STUDENTS\nIf you are thinking of working during the vacation and have a stamp in\nyour passport which imposes restrictions on your right to work, it is\nimportant to remember that if you don't get permission to work and the\nHome Office find out about it they might well refuse to renew your visa\nor else might deport you. If you have a stamp which says that you can't MARANATHA\nWhere your treasure is, there will your heart also be.\n'The ground of a certain rich man produced a good crop. He thought ,\nto himself, 'What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops. ' Then he\nsaid. 'This is what I will do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger\nones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to\nmyself. ' You have plenty of good things laid up for mah y years. Take\nlife easy, eat, drink and be merry.'\n'But God said to him, ' You fool! This very night your life will be\ndemanded from you. Then you won't get what you have prepared for\nyourself?'\n'This is how it will be with anyone who stores things up for himself\nbut is not rich toward God.' Then Jesus said to his disciples: 'Therefore I tell you, do not worry\nabout your life, what you will eat, or about your body, what you will\nwear. Life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. Consider\nthe ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn, yet\nGod feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds!\nWho of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? Since you\ncannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?\n'Consider how the lillies grow. They do not labour or spin. Yet I tell\nyou, not even Solomon in all his splendour was dressed like one of these.\nIf that is how God clothes the grass ofthe field, which is here today and\ntomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith! And do not set your heart on what you will eat or\ndrink; do not worry about it. For the Pagan world runs after all such\nthings, and your Father knows that you need them. But seek his\nkingdom, and these things will be given to you as well.'\nwork without permission it is possible to apply for permission and if you\nintend to do a job which is in some way connected with your studies\nthen it is easier to get permission.

    "content": "A Summer Episode\nPeter strode up and down the quay side, expecting his wife's arrival at any moment. Just before they had departed for Samos harbour to begin their return journey to Athens and finally on to England, Susan had insisted that she complete some last minute shopping. The harbour was a hive of frantic activity: passengers bustled to board the\nAthens bound boat while groups of fishermen fought their way toward their night's work. The end of the day was nigh, its imminent death awaited only by the night. The s un,like a translucent orb of fire, hung low in the clear evening sky, its\nshimmering rays bathing the sea in streaks of violent orange. As she watched this glorious spectacle, Susan heaved a great sigh of relief. She feared that she would never be rid of her circumspect husband, yet now she was just moments away from realising her de am of dreams. Free from Peter, she was still subject to the judgement of her conscience. How could she desert him just when his father had died, in his moment of dire need! Was her children's need the greater? Of course, she told herself as herm nd recoiled from the thought of spurning them again. To Susan, they were a panacea, her raison d'e tre. Even if her life with Virgil was doomed to failure, her children could complete it, perfect it for her. Besides, Peter was a mature man he wouldn't sink under the emotional distress of his father's death. Susan wondered whether he had received the note she had sent the hotel porter to\ngive to him. Meanwhile, the taxi drew up outside Virgil' s hotel, where they had rea r ranged to meet.\nAnxiously, Peter looked at his watch. God, she was always late. He couldn't summon the energy to gird himself to anger, for his father's demise had been like an anaesthetic\nto his emotions. The commotion on the quay side redoubled when an announcement warned all passengers of the imminence of the boat's departure. As a melee of people surged\ntoward the gangplank, Peter was knocked to the ground. Just the n,ah and from the\ncrowd stretched out and pulled him erect. It was Yan i, the young hotel porter who had appeared at their door earlier in the day. As if he sensed its contents, the boy handed Peter the letter, smiled brusquely, and departed. The boy had obviously been\ndirected not to wait for a reply.\nPeter read the following: 'Peter, I will be honest with you, just as I always have. When you read this I will be\nwith Virgil and my Jade and Augustine. For just as tranquility follows the tempest, I must follow my children. It was imperative that I take this opportunity which Iam sure is my last. I must confess too that I did tell you a white lie about Augustine: someday I will explain to you why. But she is Virgil' s daughter, not yours.\nIam deeply sorry about your father; I know you revered him. Indeed, I feel that I have betrayed you. Remember that understanding begets fore give ness: I must be with my children. I don't know if you' ll ever want to see me again, but Virgil and I...' Peter could read no more. In a fury, he tore\nthe letter into tiny shreds and scattered them\nto the wind. Immobile, he stood on the\nquay side, his arms hanging limply by his side.\nThe dying rays of the sun traced out his\nsolitary shadow. Finally, the sunset\nbequeathed the night. The world was cast\ninto an eerie twilight.\nThe boat's whistle heralded its departure.\nThe last person aboard, he stumbled onto\ndeck without really knowing where he was or\nwhat he was doing. Suddenly, he felt as\nvengeful as Achilles. He would strangle them\nboth in their sleep then drink a long,\nrefreshing draught from that cup of hemlock.\nAs they had lived and loved together, they\nwould die together. And to think that her\npoisoned womb had begun this avalanche of\nThen he would recall fragments of his\nunion with Susan: each one a bitter-sweet\nreminder ofthe ineffable joy he so frequently\nexperienced with her, and the horrible\nlon lines s which awaited him without her.\nNext, he began to lampoon her: her\nridiculous hook nose, her neurotic habits, the\nshrill tenor of her voice.\nAlternatively, love and hate, respect and\ncontempt, swelled in his heart like the ebb\nand flow of the ocean.\nThe night was sweltering. For most of it,\nthe boon of sleep evaded him. Like a fugitive\ndesire, it t anti lise d him with its offer of relief\nfrom anguish of consciousness.\nEventually, his eyes did close, and he\nawoke with the feeling that he hadn't slept at\nall. The hustle and bustle of Pireus, the Port\nof Athens, rose to his ears. For some\nunaccountable reason, he remembered the\nlast time he had approached Athens...yes it\nwas then that he had hatched his scheme to\navenge himself on his 'adulterous' wi fc. it was then he had thought of Lucy! What an enchanting, exquisite English\nRose, yet a reluctant adult like all\nadolescents. Yes, and it was she who carried\nhis child, of that there was no doubt. After\nprolonged deliberation, he resolved to see her\nas soon as he returned to London. But, no. On second thoughts, that would be disrespectful\nto his father. He would wait until after the\nfuneral, then, yes then he would propose that\nthey live together. She would be his hope,\na hope that would not abandon him.\nA heavy gloom shrouded the cemetary. It\nwas a fitting day for the old man's funeral,\nPeter thought to himself. His mother stepped\nout of the car behind his. He greeted her\ncoldly, almost as if she had been a stranger.\nThey barely spoke - Peter absorbed in his\nsombre melancholia, his mother weeping\nprofusely. This air of mourning was almost\nclaustrophobic.\nThe family group were kept waiting for\nover an hour. By now the slight drizzle had\nbecome a light rain. Apparently, earlier that\nmorning, due to the slippery surface, one of\nthe grave-diggers had fallen into a freshly-dug grave, and twisted his ankle. The vicar,\neffusive in his apologies, assured them that a replacement was being sought. With the\nGrace of God, he added, and the assistance of\nthe local Labour Exchange, one would be\nfound.\nAt long last, the ceremony took place.\nPeter listened to the tedious monologue of\nreligious euphemisms with disinterest.\nPerhaps some day their meaning would\nbecome apparent to him.\nImmediately the vicar had completed the\nceremony he offered his condolences, then\nrushed back to the church with the air of a man who has the devil at his heels. Peter\nthought it would be apt if he was about to\nprepare for a christening. As his family\ndeparted, Peter wandered aimlessly round\nthe grave-yard, enshrined in his own silence.\nAfter a while, he heard the distinctive toll\nof wedding bells, and, feeling refreshed, he\nwalked back in the direction of the church.\nThere, a sea of cheerful faces washed over\nhim, dispelling the pathos of his thoughts. A group of about forty wedding guests had\ngathered on the church steps.\n'Angels of youth, fly high, fly eagle high,'\nPeter mused poetically to himself. He wished\nthis couple well, whoever they were, and\nbetter fortune than he had had.\nAs the bride and groom emerged from the\nchapel, their guests enveloped them with the\ntraditional covering of confetti. Peter tried to\npress through the crowd to give the couple his\nown benediction. Then suddenly, he caught\na glimpse of the bride as they stepped into\ntheir wedding car - he saw the swollen\nstomach, the dainty figure and the flowing\nfeatures. It was Lucy! She looked serenely\nhappy.\nIn a moment, they were whisked away in\ntheir marriage chariot.\nAs he turned to go home, that phrase, as\nold as human suffering, sprang to his lips: ' All is well,' he mur me red,' All is well'.\nTHE END\nby Justin Newland\n\n"

The College have been\nconcentrating their efforts on\nhousing around 1500 students in\nHalls and Houses leaving the-other 3000 to their own devices.\nBut whereas until now all students were guaranteed at least\none year in a Hall or House if they\nwanted it, this year there were\nmore 3rd year students applying\nfor a place than places available\nfor 2nd and 3rd year new\napplicants together.\nBut College cannot hope to\nmeet the heavy demand for\nhousing by spending their\nresources on schemes such as the\nLinstead extension and Student\nHouses. For every student place\nin the new Linstead College has to\nfork out over ;\u00a310,000, and money\nis very limited.\nWhile students must welcome\nthis long overdue expansion in\nCollege-owned accommodation,\nCollege could do a lot more for\nvery little cost by entering into\nhead tenancy schemes. Such an\narrangement would allow College\nto sublet Hats and rooms to\nstudents while leaving the\nlandlord in charge. There would\nbe no financial outlay by College\napart from some administrative\ncosts.\nMeanwhile students are already beginning the hunt lor\naccommodation for next October. In the last few days there\nhas been a daily flow of 15 to 20\nstudents up to Michael Arthur's office seeking help.\nSome students go to the very\nunsatisfactory University of London Accommodation Office.\nMany others are forced to seek out\nflat agencies where they pay\nex h orbit ant charges only to get\nexpensive accommodation a long\nway from College.\nYet the College think there is\nno problem.\nThis year the Union have made\nseveral attempts to persuade\nCollege to do more to help their\nstudents. But most ofthe Union's ideas have been coolly received.\nMichael Arthur has also gone\nahead with his own schemes such\nas forming a cooperative to\nrenovate short-life property which will be available in\nOctober at around \u00a33 per week.\nBut Michael Arthur's time is\nlimited. His job is to run a Welfare\nCentre not an accommodation\noffice. College, however, ignored\nthe Union's plea for a full time\nAccommodation Officer.\nIt is high time that the College\nrealise that two thirds of their\nstudents face an annual housing\nproblem and do more about it.\nNEWS\nWOMEN'S SAFETY\nUnion Safety Representative\nBernard Smith is to enter into\npreliminary discussions with the\nCollege about the safety of \\\n\\ omen\nstudents especially in Beit Hall.

Not that John is particularly terrifying but it was hand written\non un lined paper with crossings-out and insertions and so forth to the\nextent that he drove me out of the FELIX office to get this article typed in\nthe Union Office, (he will be sorry) and it went on for ever! However,\njudging by the contents of last week's issue (size, editorial and page 4\narticle) he is really pushed for copy so here goes for this week's ego-trip\n(which is the only kind of trip I am going on this year).\nEnough of the above rubbish, exciting things are happening at\nLondon Student Travel, For a start we have a new advertising slogan,\nwhich runs 'For a choice of500 make 117 the first' (117 Euston Rd,\nged d it!). If you want to see the complete poster there are four copies\naround IC, one at IF, and one at RCM so get looking.\nSecondly we have signed a sole-suppliers contract with Transalpino\nfor European rail journeys. This benefits L ST in so much as we get\nhigher commissions, and benefits you, our customers, in so far as LST\nstipulates that Transalpino must be competitive (against Eurotrain\nmainly).\nThirdly, the Head Office (117 Euston rd) has started producing a weekly news sheet outlining the journeys and prices LST has on offer\nfor distribution around Union Common Rooms in the London Colleges.\nMoreover they are keen that someone at Imperial College should\nproduce a similar item for distribution at IC and environs and Chelsea\nCollege, QE C, ETC.( did you know that people come from\nHammersmith Polytechnic to use the IC office of LST?). Now, dare I plead 3rd year student? (I have this kind of death-wish that pushes me\non to face the virtual inevitability that I will be a3rd year next year) And\nthat I can't type, or use a Gestetner and where is QE C anyway? What I'm saying is that, if a news sheet is to be produced next year I would\nappreciate some help. So any keen body reading this who would like to\nhelp, will you please go into the L ST Office and tell Cathy your name,\nyear and Department and I shall try not to forget all a bg out you and\ncontact you early next year.\nIn the meantime, Malcolm Brain would like to see a flood of people\nbooking their holidays through L ST next week because he wants to\nbecome a Director (so do I but don't tell anybody) so don't disappoint\nhim.\nChristopher D Hunt.\nElk's Last Stand\nWell folks, only one week of\nterm left now - soon you can\nall disappear into the depths\nof Britain and earn thousands\nof pounds working 24hr shifts, 7 days a week in factories or walking the\nstreets of Earls Court saying\nto random passers-by who\nlook at you with lust in their\neyes 'Hello Sailor - would you\nlike an 'or rib le time?'.\nEnough of these sordid ways of\nearning a living. I 've got a couple\nof things to plug this week.\nPARKING PERMITS\n(of the temporary kind)\nWell, after I'd got all the\napplications in for temporary\nparking permits I found that there\nwere more places than there were\napplications for a July permit.\nThat is, everybody who applied\ngets a place, proving perhaps that\nthis scheme was a little futile - it\nwas College's idea, not mine.\nAnyway, as there are spaces left\nover I'm not sure whether it's worth issuing permits or not just\nfor July. I 'll discuss it with John Fuller, traffic warden at the\nExhibition Road entrance, and if\nwe decide to issue them then\nI 'll send them to individuals and\nthey should arrive sometime in\nthe last week of term.\nPARTIES, COUNCILS,\nCAMPING EQUIPMENT,SEX\nAND VM\nHere comes another plug for\nthe Exec. Party. Bring a bottle (to\ndrink after the end of the bar\nextension). It's on Thursday 21st June in the J CR and I 've been\ntold it's going to turn into one\nhell uva orgy with naked bodies\nwrithing all over the floor and spilling onto the walkway. Oh yes, bring your own fetish.\nJoint Council is tak ng place this\nMonday at 2 pm in the Union Dining Hall, observers welcome.\nThe chap who runs the stall\nwhich occasionally appears in the\nJ CR and sells cheap camping\nequipment says students are\nwelcome to call at his factory over\nthe Summer and actually buy\nstuff there. His address is 48\nRawstone St., London EC1. Tel:8372201/2, so just call there if\nyou want to get some cheap\ncamping equipment. If you're\nlucky he might sell you some\ncheap bondage equipment as\nwell.\nRight, now that this article is\nalmost over I can frolic naked in\nBeit Quad, giving everybody in\nthe FELIX Office a turn-on and\ngo and sell my body in the\nSherfield Building. Pity there's nobody there in the evening - I might have lo give it away for\nfree.\nHope to see you in the last week\nof term, in my shower if nowhere\nelse.\nMike Elk in ICU Hon Sec.\n\n"

    "content": "THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\n0/S Students' Fees Up 20%\nHuge cuts in education expenditure and yet another massive fee\nincrease for overseas students are the order of the day following the first\nConservative Budget on Tuesday.\nInstead of the 9 per cent fee increase for home and overseas students\nannounced by the previous Government, overseas students will now be\nfaced with a20 per cent rise on this year's fees. Overseas postgraduates\nwill now be paying over \u00a31,100 to attend British Universities.\nThere is no further rise in home students' fees which remain as listed\nbelow. This means that the fee differential which the College is pledged\nto oppose is now even greater than before.\nUnion President Mary Attenborough is to meet the Rector on Friday\nand is hoping for a joint statement opposing the increases.\nAmong the cuts is a massive reduction in university capital\nexpenditure from \u00a317.6 million to \u00a39.9 million, part of a total capital\nexpenditure saving in the whole of the education sector of \u00a314 million.\nMary Attenborbugh is worried that the College may now be forced to\ndelay furnishing the Linstead Hall extension.\nA \u00a35 million cut in the research council grants is bound to have its\neffect on postgraduate grant awards and research projects.\nThe Union are also worried that the 1 - 1.5 per cent reduction in\nuniversities' general expenditure will mean a further cut in the IC Union\nbudget for next year.\nWith these devastating announcements coming just two weeks\nbefore the end of term the Union will find it difficult to organise the mass\nprotests which should be every student's response to this Government.\nBut Mary Attenborough says that the Union will continue to oppose\ndiscrimination against overseas students stepping up their campaign.\nShe had warned that a Tory Government would attack overseas\nstudents but was shattered by the extent of the education expenditure\ncuts.\nThis Conservative Government came to power on a platform of\nopportunities for all. Just six weeks after their election they have totally\ngiven the lie to that claim as far as higher education is concerned\nImperial College Sessional Fees 1979-80\nUndergraduates:\nUK Students \u00a3595\nOverseas Students \u00a3770\nPostgraduates:\nUK Students \u00a3890\nOverseas Students \u00a31,010\nThe College will operate a Hardship Fund to assist students still on\ncourses who entered the College before October 1978 and who have\nbeen adversely affected by the increases in fees in October 1976,1977\nand 1978. No allowance will be made for the October 1979 fee increase.\nAssistance will be in the form of partial remissions of fees and will be\nrestricted to those students who are responsible for paying their own\nfees.\nStudents proceeding from a first degree to a higher degree or from\nMSc to research in session 1979-80, will not be eligible for assistance\nfrom the Fund.\nForms can be obtained from Mr J Bevan, Rm 344, Sherfield Building.\nUnion Welfare Advisei\nACCOMMODATION PROBLEM Imperial College students are likely to face an even worse\naccommodation problem than last year when they return to\nLondon in September, and according to Welfare Adviser\nMichael Arthur the College is doing next to nothing about it.\nWhile many other London Colleges are contacting Local\nAuthorities, taking on head tenancy schemes and setting up\nhousing associations, Imperial College have only taken on one\nhead ten can cy scheme in Lex ham Gardens, and that only after\nconsiderable pressure from the Union.\nMichaeI Arthur is worried that il the College sit back and do nothing\nIC students will lose out as other Colleges take up the limited housing\navailable.\nThe College attitude is summed up in a statement by the\nAdministration quoted in the Union's Alternative Prospectus'.\nThey say: '(.are should he taken in conducting publicity campaigns about the\nscarcity of accommodation for Imperial {.allege, students in order not to discourage\npotential students from applying lo Ibe College'.\nAnd a senior member of Administration is quoted as saving that so\nlong as students can lind somewhere to live no matter what or where,\nthere is no problem.\nMichael Arthur believes that College have no idea what rent\nstudents are paving and in what conditions they are living. In an\naccommodation survey carried out last term he found that 40 percent\nof students responding were paying over \u00a315 per week in rent alone.\nMany students are living far from College like Hackney and\nStreatham and large numbers live in Hats and beds its where there are\ninadequate working facilities. co nld. on back page\n\n"

It is about time College stopped saying that they're against lee differentials and started doing something about it.\nWell Done Again Yet again Day By Day was delivered on time despite another Wednesday afternoon exam, and Iam very grateful to Colin for\nproving so reliable. I wish I could say the same for the mystery\ngirl from IF who didn't get her article to the FELIX Office in time to decorate page4 this week.

We send\nour boat, the Rainbow Warrior to confront the Icelandic\nwhalers by positioning inflatable dinghies between the whales\nand the hunter's harpoons.\nOther Greenpeace vessels have interfered with Russian\nwhalers in the Pacific in similar efforts to protect these gentle\ngiants of the seas. The 'Rainbow Warrior9 is also despatched to\nstop seal culls and to interfere with the dumping of nuclear\nwaste in the oceans.\nTHE WALK\nThe walk starts at 10.30am, on Saturday the 7th July from the East\nHeath car park off East Heath Road on Hampstead Heath. For\nparticipants driving there, the car park will be available for use free of\ncharge. The route will go round the Heath, down to Primrose Hill and\nRegent's Park, along Baker St to Marble Arch round the Serpentine,\npast Buckingham Palace, through Victoria and finally over Lambeth\nBridge to Jubilee Park on the South Bank - a total distance often miles.\nThe walk should last about five hours.\nTry to complete the whole course. If you want to walk further, you\ncan complete additional circuits of Hyde Park - a two mile lap.\nAlternatively, if you want to walk a shorter, traffic - free course, then\nyou can start in Hyde Park and just walk laps of the Serpentine, more\nsuitable perhaps for parents with young children. The starting point for\nthis walk will be next to the car park on the North side of the Serpentine\nBridge and will be open from 11 am until 5pm. You may of course finish\neither in Hyde Park or go through to Jubilee Park.\nA detailed map of the course will be given to all walkers on the day\nfrom either of the two starting points, together with your walking card.\nThis will be stamped with the mileage completed at the various\ndesignated checkpoints along the route.\nSPONSORSHIP\nGet a form from the F \"ELIX Ofiice.Please fill in clearly and return the\ndetachable slip as soon as possible. We only want to know how many\nwalkers to expect so please do not stop obtaining more sponsors after\nposting the slip. Additional forms are available on request or you can\nphotocopy the original.\nWalkers will also be asked to collect the money pledged from their\nsponsors after the walk and remit the funds as soon as possible. Please\nsend the money either by cheque or postal order made payable to\nGreenpeace Ltd. Keep your own sponsor forms, but please bring them\nwith you to the walk so that we can register the total am out pledged per\nmile walked.\nRemember, the purpose of the walk is to raise money, so please\nobtain as many sponsors as possible. A small award will be given to the\nindividual walker raising the most funds and sponsors. To the school\nwith the largest number of participants a Greenpeace crew member\nwill give a free film show of whale campaigns and present an award.\nSUGGESTIONS FOR WALKERS\n- Wear sensible clothes and walking shoes, especially if it is raining.\nThe walk will take place whatever the weather conditions.\n- If you have one, wear a 'Save the Whale' or Greenpeace Tee shirt\nto promote the cause and the organisation.\n- Please do not bring any placards or banners. These are banned in\nthe parks and in any case this is a walk not a demonstration.\n- This is not a race - safety is as important to us as to you. Stick to the\nroute, keep to the pavements, use the subways where indicated and take\nguidance from the Greenpeace officials. Please observe the traffic lights\nat the road crossings and avoid jamming up traffic.\n- Bring some food and refreshments with you. If you want to buy\nrefreshments some stalls will be open in the parks.\n- Some First Aid points and public conveniences will be open on the\nroute.\n- If you are coming by car you may prefer to go first to Waterloo and\nleave your car in one of the numerous car parks around and under the\nNational Theatre. You can then take a Northern Line tube direct to\nHampstead (40p). Please drop no litter. There will be plenty of rubbish bins along the\nway.\n- We want to gain support for our campaign, so please be courteous\nto local residents, shopkeepers and fellow pedestrians, drivers and park\nusers.\nYOU CAN HELP GREENPEACE to save the whales from unnecessary slaughter by participating in\ntheir sponsored walk on Saturday 7th July.\nFunds are urgently needed to pay for our boat, the 'Rainbow\nWarrior,' to directly confront the Icelandic Whaling Fleet to save\nthe last of the giant Fin Whales from explosive harpoons.\nAll profits from this walk will go to finance this and similar\ncampaigns to interfere with whale and seal hunting. Although the\ncrew is volunteer, the cost of properly equipping the 'Rainbow\nWarrior' for these campaigns is very high.\nBecome an active part of the Greenpeace campaign to save the\nwhales from extinction.
