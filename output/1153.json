    "content": "11 October 1999 \u2022 Felix Film 23\nAmerican Pie Competition\nSo by now all you fresher s should have found your feet and your way around London. Have you managed to find the Odeon on High Street Kensington yet?\nYou can get there by catching the No9,10,or49 bus to the far end of the street\nor walk. It's not that far HONEST! Every week( fingers crossed) the kind\npeople at the Kensington Odeon will be teaming up with Film Felix to give away d few pairs of tickets to some lucky\nreaders. All you have to do every week is answer a sometimes not so simple question. The winners of the last competition were A Bettison\nCW at in eA Rodrigues MAnu a rL Lang\nIf you don't have your tickets yet either\ncall into Felix or email us. This week you all have the opportunity to win a pair of tickets to see the new gross-out US teen comedy American Pie. The not so simple question is: Who connects American Pie\nwith Pretty Woman?\nIf you read the review last week and haven't got around to seeing it yet then\nwhat are you waiting for? Either mail your answers to film. felix@ ic.a c.ukor call by the Felix office brandishing a piece of paper with the correct answer on it.\n\u2022 screen\nElection\nOK so this another one of those films set in an American high school, but it is not about one or. all of the\nfollowing: kids \" coming of age\", perverted humour( see American Pie), are make of Dangerous Liaisons\n(see Cruel Intentions), cool and detached reflection (see Rushmore), or a\"Go sh,I wish I was a different\nperson when I was in high school!\"( see Never been kissed), etc. As you probably know, there has been a big rush of teen films recently. Although not all of them can be dismissed. Rushmore was a fine film, and likewise Cruel Intentions.\n'Election' is set in a small town somewhere in the United States of America. We follow the developments through a small number of characters as they each tell us bits of the story. To tell you that the film is about a presidential election at a school does not do the film justice. It's all in the detail, and the detail is fantastic: humorous, dark, and observant.\nThe central character is teacher Mr McAllister (Matthew Broderick) who is the most popular and driven\nteacher in his school. He loves his job and has been married to his wife for. nine years. The second main character is student Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon). Flick is the only child of her devoted mother and \"works very hard\" at anything she does but that does not stop at her studies. Her mother is the type of per-son who writes to successful women to find out about the reasons for their success and if they have any\nadvice for her daughter. Having served on every major school committee, Tracy prepared to stand unchallenged for president. The other two characters are Paul and Tammy Metzler, a brother and sister who are in the same year as Tracy at the school. Mr McAllister, wary of encouraging the over-achieving Tracy, talks a not-too-smart Paul into the election.\nThe result is satire with a relaxed touch. The film leaves noone untouched in terms of its satire: the care less, the selfish, and even the good. Ultimately it is a very believable film and this has to do with the great\nperformances of the actors. Matthew Broderick played a brilliant Mr McAllister. Reese Witherspoon' s Tracy\nFlick and the others were also excellent. To conclude: good film, worth watching. Ahmed Good luck to one and all. "

At the conclusion of last\nweek's ball a group of male students attempted to board a bus carrying just three female students and were forced to handover their Union cards( as is standard practice) they were then subjected to a stern lecture from Natasha Newton informing them that they would be dispatched to her office for\" disciplinary action\" the next morning if they caused any trouble. With recent figures showing that crimes against young men are on the increase, the discriminatory nature of the minibus pol icy has been called into question. Ms. Newton defended the code explaining the unconscious were of the highest priority followed by lone females, then groups of female,s he stated the service was not for \"large groups of drunk blok es\" Having been one of the minibus drivers, the IC President\nclaimed\" Blok es have caused trouble and we have had to throw them off.. .they're a pretty rowdy\ncrowd.\"S he was keen to protect\nthe emergency service role of the\nminibuses and described the claiming of male student's Union cards as a preemptive measure. The restrictions placed on free bus travel are apparently due to a lack of funds, the President\nexplained \"It is not an ideal situation, but it is not about discriminating against blok es\". In Brief\nTRAGIC ACCIDENT Amongst the casualties of the Ladbroke train crash( see Felix\n1152) was form erIC student Elaine Kel low. Elaine was a bright, lively and incredibly outgoing biochemist and a hockey player, but she was probably best\nknown for her work with Dram Soc, which she chaired three years ago. Our condolences go out to Elaine' s family and to all who knew her.\nPHD'S LEFT POORLY Over the summer Financial Ser vices have been busy bringing Project99 online. It's their new system, designed to control payments to staff, sabbaticals and PhD students. But they've had problems. Some staff haven't received automated payments for two months and PhD bursa ries have come through late. One Sabbatical was overpaid by about \u00a31 800, while the other four were left with nothing. Despite staff training and a lot of work, there have been teething problems, which the University is countering by issuing\ncheques where necessary. Malcolm Aldridge, Controller of Financial Services, assures us that\nservice will be back to normal by\nChristmas, and hopefully a lot quicker. In the meantime, if you are one of the lucky few to be overpaid don't spend it. Financial Services is collecting cheques as well as issuing them. MONEY MATTERS\nUniversity applications from underrepresented groups have fallen since the introduction of tuition fees, according to the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service. The study, reported in last week's Times Higher Education Supplement shows that\nmature students, students from disadvantaged backgrounds, and those from most ethnic groups have been less likely to apply for Higher Education since1998. This news represents a reversal of the trend before1998, which showed an increase in applications from these groups. The loss of the maintenance grant and the subsequent increase in the size of student loans seems to be the most significant factor.\nUNION GOES POLITICAL\nFor the first time in living memo ry, Imperial College Union has agreed to back a political cause. At last Tuesday's meeting of ICU Council, a motion to support an NUS day of action against stud ent debt, brought by Equal Opp our t unities Officer George Const nat in ides, was passed. The Union Sabbaticals will thus be forced to fully advertise and promote the event, and lay on minibuses to enable those unable to use public transport to attend\nthe event. Although supporting a march against fees might not seem like a major step for a students union, it's definately a big move for the normally anti-political ICU, and was resolutely opposed by teh Union President\nwho warned that student demos would only receive press coverage if there was violence. LOW ATTENDANCE FAILS\nTO MAR FIELD CUP This year's Rag programme kicked off on Saturday9 th with\nthe Field Cup, the traditional City\n& Guilds Union Pub Crawl. Although turnout wa far lower\nthan last year( thanks to post-Freshers Week hangovers) half-a dozen intrepid teams still tackled the course, raising in excess of \u00a3350 in the process. As well as money, however, the competitors also succeeded in returning with\na variety of pot plants, a moose' s head and an entire bathroom suite, all in an attempt to gain vital points. The event was just a small part of the Men Cap Mega raid which took place across the cap i tal that day. The Royal College of\nScience Union also got involved, operating a street collection from their Fire Engine, J ez, and raising\nover \u00a350 in the process. "

    "content": "12 Union 18 October 1999 \u2022 Felix\nThe State of the Union\nBy Natasha Newton, Imperial College Union President\nHi, Mystic Meg here, trying to predict this week's compliant and launch a preemptive response -didn't do too bad last week. Ok, so thanks for all the feedback. Apparently Iam too anal. Sorry. I didn't want to try to be funny\nbecause I knew I would not be, still\nI will attempt to be more relaxed, in\nfact even now Iam lying down listening to whale music. (See, said I couldn't be funny.) Also we are looking into the numbers of non-student staff employed in the Union. Sorry again to all those who again thought I was a bad person over the alleged events with the sports\nhall. To be honest we are not the\nproblem the problem is the local residents. We want the sports hall, with times and areas we can use.\nThey do not want the sports hall at\nall. At the last planning meeting the\n\"in favour' petition which the Union helped to put together was ignored for the sake of a very small number of letters of complaints from the locals.\nI have copied a letter to Felix which I sent off to Warner Brothers Cine mas this week. I don't know if they'll\nprint it because it is quite long. Essentially the story is thus: Warners were afraid of fraud. They thought\nthe NUS could help the'm. They\nnow accept only NUS cards. This is\nsilly. NUS Universities can chose to have the standard card or add the\nlogo to their own cards, so the cinema is turning away all of us non-NUS universities and lots of NUS ones. I will keep you posted as to the reply I get to my letter to the Head of Operations at Warner Brothers. In the mean time, anyone who simply must goto Warner and nowhere else, can get an ISAAC card from STA on the walkway.\nWOT NOT is up and running, email newsletters are here, take a look at\nicu.wot not. net.\nThe Greater London Authority and London Mayor elections are on their way.

My interest lies solely with\nthe Students of Imperial. Not of one department or race or gender or any other division which could be made. We have 1 0 months until we merge with Wye College. What image we will present to them? Will\nthose 1 0 0 0 students be welcomed into a hostile, prejudiced en v iron ment where the last merger looks\nset to rumble on like Catholics V Protestants from Henry VIII\nonwards. I hope not. When they\narrive their courses and lives will be affected as were the lives of those\nwho endured the ICS M merger. We have the experience to make them feel at home, to understand how they will feel. At the moment they\nmust fear stepping into IC as soldiers feared going 'over the top'. Inter-CCU rivalry is a longstanding good fun tradition, but is more mascots than massacre.D are I suggest that it's time to wipe the slate\nclean.

We'd all be happy to have you.\nAlice in Chains\nMusic Bank Boxed Set\n(Columbia)\nAlice in Chains area very much maligned band. They have a career spanning over ten years and have released some of the most well crafted but least heard alternative rock music. This\nMusic Bank boxed set contains48 tracks on three CDs, from an unsigned Alice in l988 up to the present day lineup and still distinctive sound. It also delivers a fourth CD ROM of music videos, and a game. Sadly however, this disc didn't appear with my promo copy of the album. Perhaps the main reason for Alice in Chains exclusion from the rock mainstream and lack of stadium rock success is Layne Staley's chronic drug abuse. His heroin use is well documented and has prevented the band from serious touring thus losing a valuable fanbase and testing ground for new material. That aside, Alice In Chains are possibly the greatest band you never heard, as Music Bank will prove. As with all those early90 s Seattle based groups, Alice' s formula is a simple one: tortured. Powerful lyrics, a heavy, forceful riff\nand a thumping rhythm section. These three CDs take us through the evolution of that sound. From the primal late 8 0 s demos of I Can't Have You Blues and Wha f cha Gonna Do, through tracks from5 studio albums and EPs to the most recent and refined Get Born Again, there's always Jerry Contrail's discordant guitar and Staley's punchy, harrowed vocals to remind us who we're listening to. The early live track Queen Of The Rodeo is a gem simply for the lyrics and the rest of the unreleased tracks area well rounded selection: a required purchase for any rock fan's collection. Music Bank is a carefully chosen resume of Alice in Chains and is\njust what a boxed set should be, a collection of the best works of the artist or band in question. My only gripe is that they've put too many tracks from the irl992 album Dirt on the compilation. Ten out of twelve songs appear which makes me think that some of them are being used as filler.\nThat minor niggle laid to rest, Music Bank is the best boxed set\nI 've heard for along while and it chronicles a band with a unique, distinctive sound who certainly have n't had the recognition they\ndeserve. Christian\nLocked On Artists\nThe Best of...\n(Locked On)\nWith heads still banging from the exploits of\nAiya Napa garage fans are treated to the\nbest Locked On has to offer. The prominent garage label has decided to cash in\non its anthems and churned out this latest\ndouble CD compilation showcasing their\nbiggest tunes.\nPacked full of DJ's old faithfuls this collection is testament to Locked On's eminence,\nalthough it fails to make any impact on the\nplethora of garage compilations out there.\nThere is certainly no shortage of quality with\nTuff Jams making there obligatory appear-ance; used their Need Good Love which\ncrashed and burned in the clubs. The pure\nclass of tracks such as the bass ridden Dangerous and the vocal mix of Hyperfunk\nkeep the collection true to the underground\nroots of garage but this CD has primarily\nbeen produced for the commercial club-be rs wh o love the funky uplifting vibe dealt\nout by clubs like the Ministry.\nUp-beat remixes fill the second CD, Bump\n& Flex check in with a fresh vocal mix of\nStraight from the Heart, Todd 'The God' Edwards features his house mix of Need Good Love which gives the one dimensional original a party feel with its rolling b line\nand clean vocals. The Rhythm masters\ncome up with the best remix of the compilation with their superb remix of Destiny, the\ntrack grabs you from the start and refuses\nto let go; its tracey feel and echoing vocals make it a definite floor filler.\nLocked On have produced a compilation worthy of the name... and your cash.

To celebrate this\nsummer's blockbuster from George Lucas, CGC U have put together one of the most spectacular parties\nof the year.\nThis futuristic party which will\nbe more than a disco. Chill out zones and pool table are perhaps some of the more standard attractions common with any disco. The significant differences include a portion of the arena that will fe a Friday 22nd November 1999, JCR, 5 pounds\nture a miniature cinema featuring\nthe classic Star Wars movies playing all night. However, what is likely to be the greatest attraction\nbe the casino. The debut of the casino pro mises to provide a highly charged atmosphere all night long. Each ticket holder will receive a fixed\nnumber of tokens with which you can gamble all night. At the end of the evening, guests will be invited\nto exchange winnings for mystery\nprizes.\nSo for your chance to party till\nthe early hours of the morning and celebrate the motion picture event\nof the decade, purchase your Advanced Tickets (only \u00a3 5 ) . The event will be hosted in JC Ron the\n2 2 nd October and starts at 9 pm. Atlantis Is Rising\nE vents in the pipeline for later in\nthe term include the aquatic\ntheme spectacle of the year,\nAHantis: The C&G Freshers Dinner,\nscheduled for19th November. Thanks to all the City & Guild College Departments for their support:\nAeronautics, Biological & Medical Systems, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Dept. of Com put ing, Electrical Engineering, Management and Mechanical Engineering. Before this main event, on Sun day 7th November there is Raiders\nOf The Lost Bus, a bus party on a collision course to Brighton, escorted by CGC U's motorized mascots,\nBo and Derrick. Before all that, next\nweek CGC U and ICU Cinema will\nbe showing some Austin Powers\nrelated movies: Austin Powers and Austin Powers 2 on Monday, and Wayne' s World and Austin Powers 2\non Tuesday. The build up events\ntowards Atlantis will start soon afterwards in late October. The Director's Cut\nBy Dinesh Ganesarajah, CGC U President\nWe are now in a world where the attention span is shorter and Brand Loyalty is scarce. The question is no longer that of which entity you belong to, but which offers the most. The current trend of the e planet Earth is. a disease that\ndemands Bigger, Better and Faster.\nReducing process times and maximizing the adrenaline rush seems to be just away of life.\nEach new administration brings with it a new vision and new ideas of what it is that Guilds should be doing. It is not that any\nof these directions are instantly\nwrong, as any notion pushed with\ndue conviction will result in the correct success. It is the lack of any forward direction that leads to inactivity.\nThis year's City & Guilds College Union does have a direction. The direction is to put CG CUon the forefront of what is Bigger, Better and Faster. This does not mean duplicating existing activities done elsewhere and mushrooming them. Neither does it mean reminiscing with the past and restarting\ntraditions that no longer have any interest. It means organizing activities that will give CGC U the greatest unique appeal to the current\ngeneration of City & Guilds College students. The means will be a combination of reintroducing some of our more ageless customs, re styling others for the mo dern generation and introducing new ambitions. The events we have planned and the activities we participate in\nare motivated by this design. Over the year, this section of Felix, to\nappear approximately once a month, will track what we do and have planned for this generation of the Guilds man. This is what the current generation expects from us. This is Generation X. "

The all-conquering IC\nteam was prepared to start its first\nmatch against the, until now, fairly\nmediocre UCL team. However rumours were abound about the\nstrength of their team this year\nwhich proved to be mostly true as\ntheir team had a few good new\narrivals. First up was the sabre with\nJohn\" Keep your meat away from\nme,\" Dave\" Jaws\" and Mo\"Ca p tain Animal\" leading out the IC\nteam to a27 defeat in the sabre... only one fight each for Meat and Animal( the result of a night out\nbefore at a Faithless concert!).\nFairly disappointing, but with\nthe foil up next there was a hope of\na comeback with Dave\" Don't tell\nmy supervisor I was pissed and lying\nin bed all morning\" Davidge, Chris\n\"Paul Simon...\" and the great Jaws\n- who was now in desperate need of\na good ph y sio. Dave D. produced the goods and fencing superbly,\nparticularly considering the loss of\nhis trusted blade in the first fight and the fact that he had to wear a lame that made him look like a boy we a ring his dad's suit. One victory each for Paul Simon and Jaws meant that\nwe won the foil 5 - 4 , with Meat being substituted in for the last fight.\nEpee was our final weapon and we needed to win this 7 - 2 to take\nthe match. Our hopes rested with\nour newfound e pee is t Ricardo \"the\nItalian Stallion\" who fought well and showed his pedigree by taking two\nfights arid narrowly losing one against a very experienced fencer.\nThe other two e pee is ts were Dave D. and Jaws (with Animal subbing himself in a desperate attempt to\nmake an impact - it failed), who only managed to pick up one fight\nbetween them. The final score: IC\n1 0 - 17 UCL This was a disappointing first\nmatch, as we simply lack the fencing experience that we used to\nhave.\nICU Ladies\nRoyal Free & UCH Ladies.\nWell what can I say? First game of the season and we breezed through with style. Playing for the\nfirst time together, the unstructured beginning was understandable but then our opening goal raised our confidence. This fee ling was brief as RUMS scored an easy goal past veteran ' keeper Flo. Realising that we needed a win to have a chance of qu al if ying for the next round, we started\nto really get into the game. We smashed3 past their ( male?) keeper within 15 minutes, courtesy of Sarah, Jasmine and Aisha who were aided by flying winger Louise.\nAfter her stunning midfield performance in the first half,\nClaire unselfishly gave up her\nposition to give Becky ago at the\nmedics. Our pace quickened and we dominated the second half\nadding another2 goals, giving us\na final score of 6 - 1 . RUMS fell\napart and started to bitch at each other. Vas so and G&T didn't have much to do in the later stages of\nthe game, despite defending brilliantly for much of the first half\nunder varied pressure from RUM S.G&T Mel still somehow managed to do in her ankle when she attempted to kick a stray ball. Aisha completed a hat trick on her debut, and Marie got her first\ngoal in 2 years. Everyone played excellently, and with more turnouts like this, we're on our way up in the league and cup!

    "content": "6 Travel Feature Felix \u2022 18 October 1999\nSummer\nTwo weeks into term, behind on your coursework and wishing you'd done more in the vacation?\nWe started striking camp once the sun was up. The previous day's rain was nowhere to be seen, although long white clouds were stretched.across the\nsky, pinned motionless against the .morning. This bothered me. What also bothered me was the state of my head, fuzzy and confused from the wine\nand excesses of the previous night. I stumbled to our pre-arranged clearing\nand found a seat in the long damp grass. Where the hell was I?Ona hill\nnear Traunkirchen in the middle of Austria would be the geographer's answer - in a place of tranquillity with some of my best friends would be mine. Paul, Jon and I had been travelling for about ten days. We'd met up with Jan in Villach, by some miracle of organisation, and had spent the last\ntwo days searching for a place like this, right on the line.\nWhen was it? Shortly after 1 O am, Wednesday11 th August. The sun was darting between clouds in a will-you-won't you kind of way. The light had become very blue and metallic. Birds were starting to roost. The valley was beginning to darken. Then suddenly it appeared the sun, totally obscured by the moon, ringed by fluffy white clouds. The corona was magnificent,\nbleeding purple and pink, yellow, green and blue on to the clouds. Two minutes seemed to last a day, yet at the same time came and went in an instant.\nIt went very dark - Venus appeared from behind a mountain. Crickets turned\na peaceful glade into a roar of screeching. I shuddered and looked around for my shirt.\nThe moment passed, and we returned to pack up our things, but it\nstayed with me for the rest of the day. We were to part at the train station -Jon and Paul were off to Vienna, while Jan and myself attempted to get to\nSlovenia within a day. Walking down the mountain to the village I felt pretty good about life, travelling and solar eclipses, but one question still both ered me; what exactly was I doing there?\nWhy go inter-railing?\nThere are as many reasons to go travelling round Europe as there are Swiss\nrailway companies. If you think that cave exploration in Morocco would beat ad too much effort, but you don't really want to spend the summer working in the pub again, then perhaps Europe is calling you So what if it's cool to explore Thailand and sorted to spend the summer in Ibiza? Inter-railing is re\nat iv ely cheap and hassle free, while\nat the same time allowing you to improve that character profile on your CV Most of all, though, it provides a great chance to see the continent, have\na laugh, get at an, and maybe learn\nsomething on the way. Why choose trains\ninstead of buses? Because they area lot more reliable, and not much more expensive\nif you're travelling for more than 2 or3 weeks.\nBesides, you try getting from Florence to Amsterdam in one night on a bus.\nThirty days inter-railing can cost no more than \u00a3 1 0 0 0 , subject to drinking habits and exchange rates. A one month all zone inter-rail pass is currently about \u00a3 2 6 0 ; allow \u00a310-15 a night for accommodation in hostels, \u00a351 0 a day for food and suchlike, and around \u00a3 5 0 for getting in and out of Britain and insurance, and you're about there. This does, of course, assume you have a ruc sac and the obvious equipment( see below).\nIf all this sounds a little below your normal daily budget, then consider\ncamping. The only trouble is that this can be somewhat tricky in and around cities, as well as quite demanding for weeks on end. If you' d rather not take\na tent then use overnight trains (supplements will rarely cost as much as hostels), or sleep in fields occasionally. Do not sleep in the park in Freiburgyou may be woken up by some rather friendly gentlemen. My other way of\nsaving money is to spend most of the time in Eastern Europe in Zagreb I got a20\" pizza for around \u00a3 4 , and beer was only over \u00a31 in the most tourist\npermeated regions.\nAnd so it begins\nFunnily enough, I had no intention of going travelling during the summer until half way through June. Someone suggested we meet up for the eclipse\nand, since Cornwall already looked like being an over-hyped marketing\ns cam,I agreed. A group from the caving club were going to be in Slovenia,\nso Austria was the logical venue. Then someone mentioned going to Italy\nafterwards. I commented that Florence had good icecream, and some art.\nSomeone else suggested getting wrecked in the Black Forest for a day.\nSix weeks and one union handbook later we were on the good old P&O cross channel ferry on a clear, blue and rather nice summer's morning. Of course, travelling round Europe is all about experiences, seeing new places\nand enjoying the finer points of European cultures, so by the first night we were safely embedded in Amsterdam. Anyone who read Felix last year can guess how the next few days were spent. We eventually left, suitably refuelled, on the overnight train to Munich. There is one golden rule with\novernight trains; reserve a seat in advance. If, like us, you don't realise\nyou're leaving until two hours before the train goes, then there's a silver\nrule; get on the train long before it departs, grab a compartment, and try to look like the last person in the world a. respectable EU citizen would want to share space with. Taking your shoes off is a good start.\nAfter a brief diversion to the Black Forest near Freiburg, we arrived in Munich on6 th. Here we stayed at a vast and mun a! hostel known as The^^^^^TjPR<^:\n*:\n:M Tent. One of the_^^^ r^K \u00ab\"*^^\nb~** \u2122 \u00a7\nthings about travelling is the pe ople you meet, and The Tent\nwas an excellent environment for social ising. It had a cheap bar, a large nightly\nfire, and the usual gathering of wasters from around the\ncontinent you' d expect. Meeting people is also useful, as in general they give more accurate advice and information than the guide\nbooks. We learnt, from a Brighton lad called Mike, about a town called\nGroningen in Holland which I visited shortly before returning to Engl an dit was a cool student-based town, barely mentioned in Lonely Planet, that I would never have gone to otherwise.\nStopping off at Salzburg for a night or two, we then headed to Villach\nto meet our companion. The journey from Salzburg to Villach has to one of\nthe most pleasant in Europe, as the train winds its way through stereotypical Alpine mountains and valleys. We actually did the trip twice in one day,\nreturning to Salzburg before setting out to Traunkirchen.\nAfter the eclipse a succession of unfortunate experiences taught mean important lesson; don't tempt fate. Jan and I decided to camp and, refusing to pay the extortionate fees at the campsite, headed up the hill to find\nmore illegal places to sleep. I remember uttering the words \"this isn't too steep...\" words I regretted later that night as I rolled down the tent and on to a sharp rock for the tenth time. The following night we managed to get\nstuck in Jesenice, an uninteresting industrial town just inside Slovenia, wait-18 October 1999 \u2022 Felix Travel Feature\nDreams\nEd Sexton looks back on a summer gone and decides whether Inter-railing is all it's cracked-up to be\ning for a4 am train. Bored with the station ambience, we headed out of town and up a wooded hill for the night. Jan sat down under a tree explaining \"I can't be bothered to put the tent up we'll be fine in the open\". Cue storm half an hour later.\nTurning East\nAfter the storm incident I parted from my companion( coincidence, I assure\nyou) and headed to Slovenia's capital, Ljubljana. Whether or not to travel\non your own is a question many would be inter-rail ers ask themselves. The advantages are obvious; you do what you want, when you want. Londoners\ntend to live on top of each other, often literally, and there is a lot of truth in\nthe fabled \"finding yourself\" travelling experience. If you want to meet\npeople, you will - I bumped into someone who was in Linstead\nwith me on the overnight train from Zagreb to Split.\nThen again, it can be tiresome doing everything yourself; at least if there's two of\nyou the organisational bur-den decreases. -\u00abA<8 The because of the nudist beach at one end. Being a rather boring graduate, I spent most of the day at the other end where it was somewhat quieter. The island is fairly unspoilt, with a bar selling cold beer for \u00a31 a half litre the only\ncommerce allowed. After about a week of sun, little s and and no sex, during which time I met Paul in Zagreb, we headed to Pula and thence to Florence. This in itself\nproved to be tricky, partially because I ignored the tempting fate rule, and partially because Croatian bus companies are confusing and far too numerous. In the end we managed to get from Pula to Florence by using one bus\nand three trains, arriving a mere six minutes\nafter our scheduled meeting time. Florence, of course, involved pizza, art, ice-cream, art, dod gy Italian beer, and more\nart. Train hopping to Amsterdam over a Thursday night I spent the last few days\nbefore my pass ran out in Holland, recovering from travel fatigue and spending some time with a close\nfriend.\nBalkans are, put simply,\nbeautiful. The sc en er y is\nbeautiful, endless forested hills with\nfairytale hilltop castles, and some of the best\ncoastline in Europe. Ljubljana is an expanse of white\nstone and quiet backstreet s, with a dash of modern glass monolith thrown in. Zagreb' s bars stream endlessly onto steep cobbled alley\nways. The people are beautiful, from the intense good looks of the young to the dignified wisdom of the elderly - and they are the friendliest folk I 've\never met. I went clubbing in both Ljubljana and Zagreb, and the sheer\nenthusiasm and joy that the crowd possessed at having the freedom to dance until dawn is something I 've never seen in a London club.-The remnants of the break up of Yugoslavia remain, of course. I met a man in Ljubljana who used to live in Bosnia before the war. Now, under the\nDayton accord, his village Serb controlled and he dares not go back. He lives, with his wife and two children, in one room in a friend's house in the\ncity. He told me\" for so long I was bitter, now I just forgive... but I can't go back. I have no. money. Maybe next year I can' get some land, some money... maybe.\" I found myself wondering whether it was merely coincidence that a people who have endured so much suffering in recent years\nhave such strength and love of life as that which I encountered.... and then the beach\nYou can't be a cultural observer all the time and, after a few days in Ljubljana and Zagreb, I headed down the Croatian coast to Dubrovnik. Surprisingly undamaged by the siege seven years ago, when Serbian forces encircled the town on lan d and sea, the old city is a tourist trap, but a won de rful one. Apart from the beautiful marbled streets and maze of alley ways,\nthe water in this part of the Adriatic is extremely clean and clear, and very\ninviting at around18 degrees. I spent a day on the island of Lok rum, originally famous for being where\nRichard the Lionheart was supposedly shipwrecked, now more visited\nWhat to take and when to go\nThe tendency among inexperienced travellers (like me) is to take too much. A ruc sac is the obvious starting point, and sleeping bag comes in a close second, although most hostels will lend you sheets and blankets for a modest fee. Money belts seem popular, although I can't stand them - your\nwallet in a buttoned or zipped pocket is almost as effective. On the clothes\nfront never underestimate the power of T shirts, and don't pretend you won't need to do any laundry. A cheap watch with a light and a decent alarm is\na good idea there's nothing worse than going from Munich to Salzburg\nand waking up in Vienna. The standard first aid kit is a must (plasters, anti-septic, etc), and pura tabs will definitely help you to avoid water problems\n(except for the taste). El11 forms (available from the post office if you haven't already got one), photocopies of your passport and driving licence\nand some travel insurance are all useful in case of emergencies. Ob vio u sly if. you're going somewhere hot sun lotion and insect repellent should be added to that list. Travellers cheques area handy way to carry money,\nalthough the:rise of ATMs almost everywhere in Europe is rapidly making them redundant; Some loose currency is also useful - finding the bank is\nrarely your first priority on entering a new city.\nFor food and drink, a water bottle is a must, and plastic or metal cutlery and/ or bowls are also useful. Travel pillows can seriously increase com fort on long journeys, although a rolled up shirt is almost as pleasant. A day sack to put this stuff in is a good idea, particularly if you like to have a guidebook on you at all times. There's not much to choose between Rough\nGuide and Lonely Planet - both list non-existent restaurants (and, worse still,\nhostels), quote incorrect prices and are fairly arbitrary in what they cover.\nRough Guide tends to tell you more about a place and its history, while failing to provide any decent maps, whereas Lonely Planet will list the local\nswimming pool's phone number but not tell you who built the cathedral.\nTake your pick.\nA few more items which are invaluable and can be carried at all times:\nPenknife, string, those small screwdrivers you get in Christmas crackers,\nsmall torch, a lighter and, of more questionable usefulness, a compass. Obviously don't forget notebooks, pens, walkman s, cameras, etc, and the\nphone number of your girlfriend / boyfriend / mother/ lawyer (delete as\napplicable). Beware of using mobile phones abroad Iran up \u00a3 1 0 0 bill in\n2 8 days using it only for text messages and about five calls home. And don't forget your inter-rail pass, purchasable from STA.\n\n"

Yet,\nand this was the most impressive bit, the spirit of Jane Austen remained. The trainer wearing, sexy, bu b bly, rap music cast kept\nAusten's characters true to the book. Austen is all about the mating game, admitted ly it all happens over tea and cakes, but pairing off is\nwhat it's all about baby.\nThe play starts with the nieces of Jane Austen herself discovering the book\" Emma\". With a modern out\nlook they begin to act out the story. Austen can not\nresist joining in the play and so takes the role of Mr. Knightly - the hero. Interjections from the nieces voice the frustrations of the mo dern audience desperate\nfor something big to happen; \"If I was Emma Iwo yl d punch Jane Fairfax on the nose go out and get myself a man!\" The odd gimmick seemed a little\nunnecessary but this mattered not as the spirit of the\nnovel, the mating game remained the same; Jane Austen with spunk.\nJane and Louise Wilsdon\nSerpentine Gallery\nFREE\nThe Serpentine gallery is a real gem. It is free and just two minutes\nwalk from college. Jane and Louise Wilson are the makers of three\nfilms, which have emerged as a trilogy concentrating on buildings of political power. As well as the films there are related photographs and sculpture. But the films are by far the most striking. The three separate films, Parliament (A Third House),. Stasi City and Gamma, all portray these buildings with an unspecific sense of dread; threat\nthat's impossible to put your finger on. I was intrigued at the amount of meaning and emotion that it is possible to relay through films of empty places with no dialogue. All the five minute films are in sep a rate rooms. Each room consists of four screens, one on each wall. We are not talking pid d ly little TV screens, but floor to ceiling; creating the illusion you are there. To watch the film you need to be in the\nmiddle of the room and keep turning your head. This was very effective as the continuous swapping of attention compounds the over ri ding themes of unseen presence, unease, secrecy and evil power lurking in the shadows. Ok, not\" Blair Witch Project\" but creepy stuff\nnone the less.\nStasi City was the most disturbing. Now just an empty shell of an institution which was, for so long, a tool of state oppression. Lifts travel\nup and down as a woman( whose face is never seen) floats helplessly in a deserted room. The clanking of machines in the distance is\nreally very weird. Maybe there is just something unhealthy about such an empty building. Gamma was filmed at Green ham Common where the US military\nhoused nuclear cruise missiles. Every so often the camera lingers on a feature sign such as\" Contamination room\", lights flashing emergency or a dark anonymous figure hovering above a big \" Red\" butt on. The same helplessness is generated. Parliament (A Third House) was, of course, the building that I recognized best, but even this looked alien. A peculiar anonymous power resonates behind the hard seats of commons and the plush seats of the Lords far older and greater than any MP or Lord.\nThe only un please nt ness surrounding each film was because what had happened in each building. As if the driving purpose of life within a building transfers this to the building itself. We are all at the mercy of the people in places of power; but they, perhaps, were at\nthe mercy of the buildings themselves.\nTime's running out\nto see\nThe C holm on de leys& Featherstoneh aug hs Inspired by the cabaret scene.

    "content": "11 October 1999 \u2022 Felix Games 29\nJagged Alliance (PC)\nSo how did you lot spend the summer? Money earning, CV-loving work\nexperience, character building travel or head-start study? How about leading a team of bad-ass mercenaries against the dictatorship of a small\n3rd world country? Yeah, that's what I got up to. But only virtually of course. No CV brownie points there then...\nJagged Alliance2 is actually the third instalment in a series of games where the gameplay balance of strategic warfare and resource manage ment is so fine even Newton would be impressed. Queen Di adrian na holds an icy grip on Arul co, with every last scrap of money that is clawed out of the country'sore mines feeding her fetishes. Your job? Take her out and reinstate the rightful ruler, but to get to her you'll have to wipeout the army first, all with only a small band of carefully selected meres. Care fully, I say, because in this game personality conflicts are widespread amongst the varied staff you can choose from. You'll also need to make sure that your selection of hired killers is broad enough to include skilled\nmechanics, explosive experts, medics and natural 'ead ers as well as the\nobligatory marksmen. While squad selection (and more) is conducted via a virtual laptop, mercenary tasks are assigned using amap screen and upon entering territory occupied by the enemy play switches to an isometric view for battle.\nEach of your well-animated mercenaries can be made to run, crawl, crouch and jump all with an easy to use interface. Battles are executed\nwith a combination of real-time movement and, upon sighting a foe, turn-based combat. This system works very well for strategic warfare without\nthe annoying hitch of older turn-based games where one spent ages mo ving each team member bit-by-bit across the sector looking for the last bad guys to kill. Combat is fairly engrossing with countless guns available( all\nwith realistic physics), plus the ability to lob grenades, throw knives, use\nbazookas, and modify your inventory with items found along the way.\nBlowing someone's head off with a shotgun or drilling them in the chest\nwith MAC10 burst fire is most satisfying, but you may find it annoying when a wounded adversary pulls off blindingly accurate shots while your\nace sniper misses a sitter...\nOverall, unimpressive graphics, weird (but amusing) dialect and lack of\nenvironment interactivity prevent this game from attaining dizzy-heights\nstatus, but don't let that deter you because all things considered this is a well-put together campaign that is certainly worth fighting.\nViv\nreact\u00ae\nTiberian Sun (PC)\nTiberian Sun is the kind of game that grabs your attention and doesn't let\ngo for along, long time. Drawing on their eleven years of experience writing real time strategy games, Westwood have produced the most detailed\nand tactical RTS to date.\nWhat makes the game quite so addictive is its complexity. Every strategy\nfor victory has a counter strategy, every unit has a use and every attack has\nto be intricately planned if it is to succeed. During some of. my massive\nfour-hour long multiplayer matches I have found myself coordinating simultaneous subterranean, ground and aerial attacks, while at the same time dodging missiles fired at my base and trying to coordinate artillery\nsupport with a human player ally. TS does not add any really new ideas to\nthe genre - given the development time I would have expected something a bit more novel - but all the old Command and Conquer ideas have\nbeen taken out of the cupboard, dusted and polished until they shine like\nnew.\nThe graphics engine is adequate, although some3 d hardware acc e ler ation would have been nice. The maps are also now properly 3 D and completely de formable. The controls have been improved by the addition of\nwaypoint system, and the routing for units has been completely rewritten,\nso that units can find their way across the map without constant babysitting from the player. However, I can't help thinking that the two mouse button control system used in games like Starcraft and Total Annihilation( in which you left click to select units and right click to issue orders) is far superior to the left-click only system used by all the Command and Conquer games. The most important part of the game, however, is the units.\nIn a lot of other RTS games the best strategy for victory was always to build\nas many heavy tanks as possible and charge into the enemy's base with\nall guns blazing. But in Tiberian Sun, this just isn't possible. Assaults on the enemy base require planning, timing and a well-mixed set of units to\nwork.\nThe single player campaigns are varied and at times challenging, but this\ngame is mainly aimed at the multiplayer market. If you've got a local network or a decent Internet connection then be prepared to have some real\nfun. If not, then the computer controlled opponents are certainly harder\nto beat than in past C&C incarnations, but are still too unresponsive and unintelligent to pose much of a challenge after a few games. Either way,\nI would still advise any real time strategy player to buy this.\nBen\n\n"

Now, we move to the\noven. I'm not going to talk about baking cakes etc. Generally, this\nrequires you to follow recipes very\nclosely, which simply isn't my style.\nAs always, Iam going to give some simple guidelines for making beautiful, delicious food, out of pretty\nmuch whatever you have to hand. Individual ovens vary hugely, to the extent that times and temperatures given in recipes are often a long way off the mark for your oven.\nHowever, with a little experience it is\nvery easy to work out the best ways.\nAs a quick and very rough\nguide, 2 0 0 \u00b0 C,or Gas Mark6 is\nstandard for most cooking. Any thing higher is very hot, and will\nburn most food quickly. Below 1 60\u00b0\norGasM ark3 is cool, and only\nreally used for slow cooking. Ovens are used in two ways.\nWhen food is cooked uncovered, it\nis exposed to a dry heat, which is\nparticularly good at browning and caramel ising food. Pretty much anything cooked uncovered in an oven\nlooks more app et ising than when it\nwent in. Covered food often comes out looking anaemic. The aim is\noften to soften, particularly tough\ncuts of meat, or to merge flavours.\nMuch covered oven cooking can be done on the stove top, but keeping\nheat constant is easier in the oven.\nMeal Suggestion\nGarlic Mushrooms\nA fantastic, simple idea from Nigella Lawson. This is enough for one.\nMake up some garlic butter, by mixing a large, crushed clove of garlic\nwith around50 g of butter. To prepare a clove of garlic, chop off the\nstalk end, peel off the dry skin, and chop into very small bits. Crush between a hard surface and the\nedge of the knife, or with a garlic\npress. You may need to melt the\nbutter for10 seconds in the\nmicrowave. If you have it, add some parsley, either a teaspoon of the\ndried stuff or a small handful chopped fresh.\nWash couple of the flat field\nmushrooms, the stuff the mixture\nround the edge. Cook in the oven\nfor about15 minutes at 2 0 0 \u00b0 , Gas Mark6. When they are done, stuff\neach into a roll, and eat quickly!\nAdvanced Tip\nSavoury Roulade\nMaking a basic savoury rou lade is\nsurprisingly easy. Lots of pans are\nrequired, but none of the steps are\ntoo fiddle y. The basic principle is to make a thin sheet of sponge, which\nis rolled, like a swiss roll, but with a sauce-like filling. The sponge is simply a thick white sauce, with added egg. The quantities here are enough for two people.\nStart by making a simple roux in\na large sauce pan. About25 g butter and a couple of level tablespoons of flour should do it. Slowly\nmix in around200 ml of milk, leaving a thick sauce. Season, this white\nsauce with salt, pepper, and possibly mustard powder and parmesan.\nLeave the sauce to cool for a few\nminutes, then mix in the yoke of an egg. Whisk the egg white, then fold\nit into the sauce.\nTurn the mixture out onto a baking tray, covered in well greased\nbaking sheet (about 3 0 cmx20c m). Stick it in the oven at 2 0 0 \u00b0 orGasM ark6 for about10 minutes.\nWhile the sponge is cooking, make some kind of filling. I normal ly go with broccoli and gruy ere. Start by make a simple cheese\nsauce (use the same procedure as\nbefore, but with half the flour). Cuta small head of broccoli into very\nsmall florets, discarding the stalk.\nSteam for around5 minuets. When the sauce is finished, melt in around50 g of grated gruy ere, then mix in\nthe broccoli.\nThe sponge will probably need\nto be separated from the baking\nsheet with a palette knife. Lay it\ndown scraped side up, and spread\nthe sauce across all but 5 cm at one short end. Finally, simply roll the\nrou lade from the other short end, cut into slices, and serve.\n\n"

Russell\nVeronika Decides To Die\nPaulo Coelho\nHarper Collins, \u00a39.99\nVeronika Decides To Die is the latest offering from Brazilian author Paulo Coelho and he continues to do what he does best, examining the nature of life and the human condition. The story opens with a young Slovenian woman who is busy consuming sleeping pills to end her life. She is not motivated by sadness or extreme depression, but rather because she has come to the realisation that her life is a routine\nwhich although enjoyable now, will in time become unbearable as a result of repetition and the ravages of old age. She is afflicted by a sentiment worse than sadness - utter powerlessness.\nFollowing her attempt on her own life, Veronika awakens wondering if she has arrived in Heaven until she realises\n' Heaven would never use a fluorescent tube to light a room, and that pain - which started a fraction of a second later\n- was typical of the Earth. Ah, that Earth pain - unique, unmistakable.' She has arrived not in the after life, but rather\nis strapped to a hospital bed in a lunatic asylum. Drawing heavily from his own life, having spent some time in an asylum during his childhood, Paulo Coelho explores some of the same themes that appear in his othe r works; faith, des tiny, mysticism and personal awakening. Veronika learns to find hope and meaning in her life where previously there was none. She learns a new language of\nemotions and gains insights into her past and hope for her future. Where Coelho' s most renowned work, the Alchemist,\ndealt with realising your destiny and following your dreams, Veronika is about finding the intrinsic joy in life.

So has it? Has it, my\nring! Noone thought that Imperial\nand iCS M would immediately jump into bed with each other on the first\ndate but it would be nice to think\nthat we could at least sleep in the\nsame room. For those of you who are new here I shall briefly explain what the\nscore has been over the last few of\nyears. In 1 9 8 8 the publication of\nthe Thom lins on report on medical education in London decided that\nthere were too many small( uneconomic) medical schools. This led to\nthe subsequent merger of some of\nthese schools, the most important of which being Charing Cross with\nWestminster and St. Mary's with\nImperial and the subsequent mer ger of Charing Cross and West mi nster with Imperial/Mary's to form what we now know as ICS M. From there on in it has been a bumpy ride with Imperial trying to impose a technical college way of life to\nmedics and the medics trying\n(rightly or wrongly) to maintain the\nmedics way of teaching and student life. As you can imagine this\nhas not been and easy time for either the medics or our new mot her college but with vast amounts of\ncompromise and the occasional flare up it looked like we were on track for the first easy year since\n1 9 8 8 .\nUnfortunately this looks like\nbecoming more of a dream than a reality with both student presses\n(Felix and Prince Albert) being more than willing to publish badly\nresearched even sometimes libel us reports about each other without\nreally thinking through the potential consequences for medic non-medic relations.\nIn my humble opinion I think\nit'snow time to forget our differences (or at least accept them) and get on with having fun and studying whatever we came here to\nstudy. I think it would be a real\nshame if IC and ICS M got a reputation for bad feeling and animosity between it's own students when at the end of the day we are all\npart of the same college. Tom Burchell\nPrince Albert Editor\nOR ALTERNATIVELY...\nDear Felix,\nWhat the F**K have you guys\nbeen smoking??? If you hadn't noticed we are at the same college as you and Tasha Newton is your\npresident, she is not a medic, she is\nemployed by Imperial College of\nScience, Technology and Medicine and was elected by you to represent the views and wishes of the\nentire student body. If you feel so\nstrongly about her then you shouldn't have put a tick next to her\nname. If you want to take it further\nthen you might like to get some signatures from your non apathetic\nstudent body and start a vote of no confidence. If on the other hand you are just using her as an excuse\nto slag off medics then stop. We would like to be a member of your\nhappy family and not just the pretty sister who pulls all the blok es. Tom Burchell\nPrince Albert Editor\nAND FINALLY...\nDear Felix,\nIs the five year old responsible\nfor designing the Account Forms\nthe same as the one responsible\nfor printing and distribution ot the\nMonthly Reports'?\nOne of the many baffled accounts clerks\nWell, the point is this: As s iI' m not Felix Editor and in s tI'm just some random th irc fourth year student. I war into registry the week be\nterm begins and say some o name. They give me af which I have to sign, from woe ran an ex r or K in.igo a own10 security and got a new swipe card made up with my new identity. I then popover to the Union and pick up Union, UL U and LT\nDiscount cards all in this false\nname. OK, so I 've got lots of\nplastic - what good is that? Well, for my next trick I wander into\nNat West and ask to open a student account and unless Nat West policy has changed recently, they accept my regis tr ation form and one other proof of\nmy address( ie an envelope on which I 've typed the correct false\naqa in and pick i my new account and withdraw the cash ASAP if he/ she was on a full grant I'm now \u00a3 8 0 0 up.

I don't vith a thing ct s some of\ne an interest\n-ik a little, it\nhow few people there are on this\ncampus who are prepared to speak up for their interests or to\nensure that they get a fair deal. Oh, and no prizes for guessing which of the letter writers on the\nopposite page is going to run for sabbatical at the end of the\nyear.,.\nAnyway, it looks like we're in\nfor along winter of\" do we want a merged College or not\" debate( especially with the\nmurky issue of merging sports\nteams rapidly appearing on the\nhorizon). My answer is a simple \"Yes of course we do, stop being so stupid\", but then again Ido have a tendency to be a little\nidealistic. If nothing else, I'm glad to be able to agree wholeheartedly with everything TomB ur chell says in his first letter\n( and indeed most of what he says in his second) particularly as Tom is just about as much of\na diehard old school Mary's man as you' re likely to find. I look for v/ ard to the next issue of\nPrince Albert with great relish.\nAs a great man once said, communication is the issue. Dove\nAll complaints should be addressed to the Editor.

    "content": "4 Interview Felix \u2022 18 October 1999\nclever by half: in gh The bestselling author of Fermat's Last Theorem has a few surprises up his sleeve. For starters,\ndespite have written two massively popular books\n(his latest work, The Code Book, shot straight into\nthe top ten in it's first week), secured a Physics PhD from Cambridge and picked up several awards for\nhis work with the BBC( where he directed the\nacclaimed documentary on the famously inexplicable Theroem), he's actually a graduate of Imperial\nCollege. So, Simon Singh, over to you...\nAre you happy you chose Imperial?\nLooking back, I guess Iam. Like a lot of people\nhere, I applied to Oxbridge, and in retrospect I think it was a definitely good forme to have been\nrejected - I'm just not good at talking to strangers\nor working in groups... Nonetheless, it's very strange to come back...for my sins I was RCS President for a year in\nthe late eighties, and long before they were famous\nI booked people like Paul Merton and Julian Clary\nfor the Ents Lounge [smiles and gazes into the mid dle distance].\nSo why did you leave IC and opt for Cambridge?\nAfter a time you have to move on. I read about one leading biochemistry department which would only\naccept students from other un is for PhD's. Stipulating it like that might be going a bit far, but nonetheless it's a very sensible philosophy - after four years\nhere I needed a break and a change. Anyway, there\nwere only a handful of universities in the country\noffering the course I was looking for, and Cam bridge was probably the best...\nHow did you get into media?\nI realised while I was at Cambridge that I wasn't going to be a great physicist, and I started looking\nat how to get a job in the media.

When I was writing Fermat's Last Theorem I started to learn about\ncodes, and there's a section in\nThat book ThaT I really wanted\nto develop on, but it didn't really fit into the main story.\nNow, however, by giving it it's own book I can go into every\naspect of codes and codebreaking\nin as much detail as I want to.\nEssentially, there are three\nmain threads: Firstly, it's one third a history book[ examples and details]... secondly it's about the\nmaths and science behind encryption and cracking [examples]...and\nthe final third is a look at the future\nand the possibility of developing\nthose 'unbreakable' codes with the\nadvent of massive computing power available to all.\nFinally, what's the contest in the back of the\nbook about?\nIt's just a bit of fun really - a chance to put what the\nbook teaches you into practice, and possibly win\nsomething along the way. It is interesting to see the\nrange of people who solve the puzzles, though - the\nfirst correct solution to the first level was a speech\ntherapist, the second was broken first by a philosopher, the third by a brain therapist, and the fourth\nwas cracked by a15 year old girl...[the latest\nupdates on the contest can be found at www.4the s tate.co.uk/cipher challenge] Both Fermat's Last Theorem and The Code Book\nare available from all good bookshops and are\ncoincidentally damn fine reads.\n\n"

Mixed fortunes for football\nMen's Football\nKing'sI2 IC I2 After the legendary season last\nyear, it was all a bit d is app o in ting today with a mediocre performance. The awesome machine was not\nparticularly well-oiled and it had a few new parts from last year.\nSteve, who started on the left\nside of midfield, showed he had a few tricks with a mystical run down the wing but we failed to get the ball to him for the rest of the game. The star of the show was clearly\nFoulstone. With no contact lenses\nand still drunk from Le Scandal e, he dazzled us all with his skills, the pick\nof the bunch a classy treading on the ball and falling over, gifting the\nKing's forward with a run on goal. The goals came from the mid-field, the first a seventy yard( maybe) shot from Dave. King's equalise d within a minute, but IC took the lead again with Nick's not so classic finish, as he pounced like\namy nx during a goal mouth scram ble. Once again King's hit straight\nback, this time within two minutes.\nAll in all, a disappointing start,\nbut at least we never let them have\na sniff in the second half and IC\ncould have won it when Tony was put through by a move with War ren, Alex and Dave. IC II ...\nKing's First game of the season, a new beginning. This was a team that\nthe seconds thrashed towards the\nend of last season on the way to winning the league so much was expected.\nA great start was made by\nmighty IC, playing the ball confidently all over the park. Alistair and Dave were the backbone and then\nNac bo and Darren superb on the\nflanks. Then they started to find\ntheir stride, a few rash tackles later\nthen a very slight push by Elliot in\nthe box saw then get a penalty -result Ricky saves amazingly.\nAfter a stern talk from John at\nhalf time second half started, then\ngreatest contribution of all, Brad\nBaskett comes on up front for his IC\ndebut. Two minutes later he's back on the touch line for a horrible off\nthe ball incident. With ten it was always an uphill battle and in the85 th minute they got the break\nthrough with a minute togo Martin hit the post - but it was all too late.\nIC IV...\nLSE IV.\n.0\n..0\nAfter finishing as the best placed4 th team in London last year,\nwe started this year with adi sap pointing performance. Things have\nto improve or we won't get anywhere near the legendary status we achieved. The1 st half wasn't bad, with Bola being an animal in mid field and Knut Rod stretching their\nback line with great making long halls. Peynouz had a good game on the left and the back line was sound. Our front line in the 1 st half ran\ntheir hearts out but to no avail, it\nfinished 0 - 0 at halftime but we came out with the captain's mad rants and raves ringing in our ears.\nPee, Chin's and Nick came on in\nthe second half but we. conceded two goals in ten minutes.

The third floor renovation (designed to provide far more space for meetings) and the\nlaundry facilities for sports teams are also likely togo unless extra\nfunding can be found. The problem comes as a direct\nresult of the College's refusal to guarantee funding for the Union Unsurprisingly, the bill to renovate these spaces will be huge Photo: Archive\nside of the Beit project. The total\ncost of the project is projected at\napproximately \u00a3 7 5 0 0 0 0 . However,\nthe Union's Strategic Development Reserve (generated from bar, retail\nand catering profits) only currently\ntotals \u00a3 3 5 0 K. Consequently, although the College have agreed to give the Union an interest free\nloan of \u00a3 2 0 0 K,a \u00a3 2 0 0 K shortfall\nstill remains.\nHope remains that the College will agree to part fund the project,\nas two of the major sections of the\nnew facility - the Islamic Prayer\nRoom and the College Chaplaincy are being relocated from College administered areas. Consequently,\nthe Union is freeing up space for the College, but not receiving any monetary compensation to make the new space( in the basements\nbelow the new halls) habitable.\nHowever, with work due to take\nplace next summer and the tender\noffer going out very soon, a dec i sion to save the Prayer Room will be needed within the next few weeks -otherwise work could be postponed indefinitely.\nQueen's Lawn to Host Summer Ball\nSUNIL RAO As previously reported in Felix, the two summer balls ( one for IC, the other for ICS M only) held in June1999 both made hefty losses, almost \u00a3 4 0 , 0 0 0 in all, and both unquestionably flopped. Naturally,\nquestions have been raised, discussions have taken place, lengthy\nmeetings have been held and a whole rethink of the summer ball\nthing is taking place, or so we are told.\nWe are still to have two sep a rate balls (that's summer balls, not any other kind!), but this time they\naren't to be held on successive\ndays. In fact, Natasha Newton, ICU President, informed us that the\nmedics' event would be held \" much later\", in the summer holidays, though it turns out that it will most\nlikely be held only one week after\nthe main event. A number of ICS M staff and senior students, reluctant\nto throw away over\"60 years of balls\", are reportedly refusing to even consider the possibility of there being held one Ball for2000. As of Thursday morning, it\nappears that the IC ball is to be held inside College, with the food to be served possibly in a marquee on the Queen's Lawn. ICU Ents\nand Marketing manager Mark Home is apparently very keen on the idea and has already been busy inviting tenders for the host-ing. The other possibility is to carry\non in Alexandra Palace as before,\nbut it appears that prices will have\nto be jacked up quite a bit -p ossi bly reaching \u00a3 1 0 0 per head. Attractive as the idea of a Ball in a glamorous venue like a top hotel\nmight be, it looks like it will have to be abandoned. There is a slight\nproblem in that the Queen's Lawn\nhas never been used for this sort of\npurpose or indeed any large sit-down dinner before, but contra c tors have assured ICU that it will\nbe possible to accommodate a thousand people there.\nOrganisation for the IC Ball\nappears to be in trouble already,\nwith nobody showing any interest\nin being Summer Ball Chair this\nyear, hardly surprisingly.\nFelix was unable to reach Mark Home in time, but Natasha New ton emphasised the need for a Summer Ball Chair to be appointed soon, adding \"IC is now ranked higher than Oxford, let's make sure\nour Ball's better than theirs too\".

No doubt you'll\nbe busy clubbing, visiting all the popular bars and pubs, taking in the culture provided by numerous theatres\nand galleries...but there is another\nside to London that you might never\nsee. Why not try helping out the community? If might give you a different\nperspective on life!\nOur oldest project is the Soup\nRun for the homeless. Every Tuesday\nand Thursday, we meet at 8 . 0 0 p.m. in the basement kitchen of Weeks\nHall in Princes Gardens, where we prepare food and hot drinks. We then go by minibus into central Lond on, armed with our bags of food, urns and friendly conversation. There\nare many interesting and dynamic\npeople to meet on the street so come along and give Soup Run ago. Our second project involves visiting Parkcare elderly nursing home, ideally located off Queen's Gate. Visits usually consist of casual chats\nwith a resident or joining in with a group activity, such as bingo. Last\nyear, one student ran weekly origami\nclasses for residents. It is just a time\nfor the resident to have a break from\nthe monotony of the nursing home.\nThe third project is called Tools\nfor Self Reliance. This involves taking\nsecond hand tools, such as saws and\nhammers, and refurbishing them for\nuse in developing countries. But don't worry - you don't need to know anything about tool mending! Once refurbished, these tool kits are sent\nout to community groups and schools in Africa and a central part of\nthe project is building up awareness\nof the technological problems associated with development.\nWe are always interested in starting new projects, so let us know if you\nhave any ideas. Come along to any\n(or all!) of our projects. Membership is free and you don't have to make a regular commitment. Helping the\ncommunity through volunteering will\ndefinitely be a rewarding experience!\nKnown through the ages as\nTabrobane, Ce i lao, Ceylon and even\nSerendib, Sri Lanka is has gathered a plethora of names each revealing its\nrichness and diversity.\nAt Imperial College, about 3 0 %\nof students are from overseas from a variety of countries each with their\nown distinct cultures. While studying\nin this environment, we all have the\nopportunity to mix with people from\nthese cultures and learn about them.\nImperial College Union has many\nsocieties that have aims to promote\nknowledge of these cultures to o th ers: ICU Sri Lankan society (ICUSLS)\nis one of these societies.\nWhen travelling to another co un try, it is very easy to just follow a tourist package holiday to see another part of the world. It's quite possible\nto simply live in a hotel and travel on organised tours to obtain a glimpse\nof the nation. This is what many do each year and unfortunately they do not get a true feel for the culture;\npeoples attitudes and beliefs. They\nobserve what others (the tour opera tors) want them to see. They hear\nonly what a tourist video would tell\nthem, but they do not fully understand how the different cultures cause\npeople to think in different ways.\nICUSLS want to provide a platform for encouraging closer social\nintegration among Sri Lankans with\neach other and other students at col-leg e.So whatever your interest in Sri\nLanka, whether it be family origin,\nwhether you have Sri Lankan friends\nyou would like to understand more\ncompletely or even if you just want to\nvisit Sri Lanka for a holiday/work\nexperience/medical elective, ICUSLS\nis here to help you.\nThe society is having its first general meeting this Wednesday in\nRoom403 a, Fourth Floor, Department of Electrical Engineering at\n2 pm. All are welcome and members\nare usually privy to a free cinema trip\nor game of bowling.\nInternational Tamil Society\nIf you want to work\non big projects,\nthey don't get any\nbigger than this.\nFire. Air. Earth. Water. Bechtel has\nmastered them all. In our 100 year\nhistory, we' ve been responsible for\nsome of the biggest engineering\nand construction projects the world\nhas ever seen. They include 7 5 airports and airport systems, 8 0 ports\nand harbours,30 tunnels, 2 5\nbridges, 8 9 5 power projects and the\nquelling of the Kuwait oil field infer-no, which we achieved in less than\nhalf the predicted time.\nIf you think you have what it takes to\nwork on some of the most challenging projects in the world, send your\nCV or S AF with a letter persuading\nus to interview you to Graduate\nRecruitment, Bechtel, 2 4 5 Hammersmith Road, London W68 DP.

Please confirm your attendance by email-If you are interested in Tamil Cul ture, this society provides a forum in which you can participate to increase your knowledge of us\nand have a goodtime. We are simply a dynamic group of students who are united to share our talents to further this society. Come and meet us at our 'Fire\nOn The Thames' boat party, read on for details. Founded in May1993 the International Tamil Society has steadily grown over the years with\nthe help of past and present members. This has increased the scope of our efforts in terms of fundraising and organising various social events.\nThe aims of the society are to: \u2022 Represent all students of Impe rial College who have an interest\nin Tamil culture, tradition and we l fare.\n\u2022 Provide a social platform for Tamils of all nationalities, and other interested parties;\n\u2022 Experience and appreciate Tamil culture in away that will\nnurture friendship across the cam pus.\n\u2022 Organise events, in aid of charity, to promote Tamil Culture and conduct activities that educate and entertain members of all communities by fully displaying the depths and breadths of Tamil\nCulture. Our source of income is\nmainly based on the Imperial College Union funds and the annual subscription of our members. The society is part of the Social Clubs Committee and managed by\nenthusiastic committee of dedicated members. In addition to major high pro file events such as Annual Cult u ral Show and Annual Dinner& Dance, we organise Bowling, Cinemas, Dinner outings, Go Karting and Ice-Skating as well as other sports act ivies. Last year we produced the cumbersome ly named sellouts how\" K all uri Kali gall\" which was enjoyed by 5 0 0 people. With a feast of funky dance routines and meticulously produced plays, this\nwas the show that had everybody buzzing. The proceeds from this event\nwere donated to the Tamil Rehabilitation Organisation, and used for the education of displaced Tamil children in North& East Sri\nLanka. In February this year, our Annual Dinner and Dance, \"Ivory\nDreams\" took pi ace. The night\nwas atmospheric with the exotic\nfood, youths strutting their funky\nstuff and catered for over200 people. This past year seen us competing for the title of best and most active society at Imperial. This year we hope to build on our ongoing success, and we are looking for dedicated people who can use their talents to take us\ninto the next Millennium Regular meetings are he ld on Wednesdays at 1 pm in Room403(4 th Floor) Electrical Engineering Building, membership is \u00a3 3 . 5 0 .\nDon't forget that the \"Fire On The\nThames\" boat party is only a few weeks away, on bonfire night Frid ay5 th November.

The deal\nis it goes, and whether that leaves\nour teams with room and time to\npractice/play etc, is what the Union has been fighting about. All of this\nmeans that the stronger willed medics don't give a monkey's! I did and so does the DP Clubs and Societies.\nTrue fact two: Council planning meetings took place over the sum mer, iCU council did not. Thus the\ns a bbs together with the Union manager did our best to talk to College and negotiate enough space and time in the new centre.\nA lot of work was done by Tim Trailor (DP Clubs and Socs) and as I said last week we are finally\napproaching, what our clubs need. The next council planning meeting\nis on the 14th of October( after this\ngoes to press, outcome next week),\nthe next council was the12 th where f he membership was informed of what had gone on. They asked questions and did not object (This is as close as they get\nto' supporting' things).\nTrue fact three: I hope it is now clear that the volley ball provision\ncould have been completely diminished had Tim not worked on this\nand if we had rolled over to College's demands. At one point College was suggesting we merge clubs like martial arts to reduce our usage would that have been fair?\nIam sorry that neither of you felt able to talk to me about this. I realise that this would have to mean you putting a face or a name to you letter/column. There will be occasions this year when I will do things which go against some students - unless College replaces us\nall with Clones. But maybe the\n'talk to Tasha' suggestion isn'tso' crap' after all. I also understand\nthat ' Union attempts to protect\nsports provision for all IC students\nregardless of C CU' would have\nmade a less juicy story and would have afforded less personal insults.\nStill maybe a little trust can be gained by this experience.\nAnyone who wants the full\npaperwork on the ongoing sports\nhall developments, please contact the Deputy President Clubs and Societies at dpC s@ic.a c.uk. Tasha\nDear Felix\nIam writing in reply to the\ninane ramblings in the\" Break Point\" column last week. The. tone of the column does suggest that the\nwriter is only writing because of a personal vendetta he has against\nLa President in a( NOT El Presidente!). There may be some c au tion about how well Tasha Newton will work as a MedicI CU President.\nThis caution is, however, only based on the performance of the previous Medic to have held the position, whose performance was only marginally better than his\nchoral conducting skills.\nThe comments about Medics shouting louder than everyone else\nmay appear to bev a lid to many people. In my experience, there are\na few Medics who rant and rave,\nbut the majority get on with their\nlives and are generally very co operative and are not very different\nfrom the rest of the students at IC. The main decision makers in the\nMedics SU, including their new sabbatical President, are very amiable, enthusiastic people who are willing to work with, and to benefit,\nall students at IC, not just the Medics. If the students at IC would actually talk to the Medics, rather\nthan just believe everything that is\nwritten in Felix, they would find that\nthey can drink as well as any engineer or miner( take note C&G& RSM) and some are even interested\nin sci-fi (RCS?).\nFinally, the details about sports\nprovision at IC.I am told by several good sources that the so-called\nfacts in the column are not entirely\nCorrect. I personally do not know\nany of the facts, so I will not com ment further. In future, maybe the\nwriter of the column should take a similar position.\nJohn Quant re ll ICU Arts & Ents Board Chair QUIZ COMEBACKS Dear Kevin, I must take exception to your\nhighly misinformed piece of text\nmasquerading as a feature article\nfrom issue 1 1 5 2 , 1 1 October. It is\nindeed a fact that the team that\nqualified to appear on the televised\nrounds of University Challenge was\na team of medics but if only you had bothered to read Felix last year\nyou would have known that the college wide trials the Quiz Society\norganised last year attracted a fair\namount of attention, and the team that was picked was the best that\ncould be given the circumstances.\nThe chance of losing out on exceptionally good quiz z ers with a team-based competition for entrants that\nyou suggest is simply far too great\nfor it to be viable. Taking part in something so prestigious as UC should be a matter of pride, but the fact is that it is\nnext to impossible to groom a team or for individuals to take part in\nsuch an intellectually demanding quiz contest without taking part in\nregular quizzes and reading around to keep abreast of events\nand happenings in the world outside academia. This is where having a Quiz Society helps, but the\nsad fact is that nobody appears to\nbe bothered about it or to show any genuine interest in joining or taking regular part in one. I might\nas well admit that the Quiz Soc exists only in name, it has next to\nno members and no money and may God help Imperial's chances once Chris Harrison leaves here.\nIt's not always that the informal\nteam you form with mates down the\nThe deadline for letters intended for publication is Wednesday 12 noon - drop into the porta-cabins or email felix@ic.ac.uk.

As you've already lost complete control\nof all of your bodily functions, he suggests that it must be time for your first\nvisit to the mystical wonderland that is La Scandale. Being the rational mind\nthat you are at the end of a Tuesday night, you naturally agree.\nThis is it. You are finally going. Wait until you tell your friends in hall and on your course that you were first to go to what surely will become your seco nd home and you can, them and the other 1 0 0 0 IC students waiting in\nthe cue. Once you're in, everything is going well, there's only one person\nin front of you in the cue for the bar. But the wait continues, in true La S can dale fashion he's ordering five triple vodka s and coke, three triple malibu s and orange and that's just for him.

Sure ifs a bit\nleaky in places, but there's some nice rock tunes on it.\nAll fairly standard indie-rock but laced with an eclectic mix of other\nsounds. Listen carefully\nand you can hear strains of\nRadiohead and even Led\nZepplin.\nBizarreness aside, I can really imagine the punters\nat Camden Underworld bouncing around to one or\ntwo of the songs on a Friday night, particularly Natural Millionaire and George. The quieter\nsongs are musically\ndependable but lyrically\nuninspiring, which is a shame. Further, this album sticks to the rigid format of\n'Rock anthem at the beginning and mandatory classical instrument track further\non'. Cube seem to think\nof themselves as a depressed neo-Verve.\nAll in all, it'san average album that could have\nbeen a lot, lot better. A little too two dimensional perhaps?\nHardy frequency\nMatador Artists\nEverything is Nice\n(Matador)\nAfter 1 0 years in the business, Matador recordings have decided to\ngive us this triple-CD compilation to celebrate. As you would expect from\nsuch a high-profile label, the back cover reads like a who's who of indie\nmusic: on just one of the discs, there are contributions from the likes of\nMo gwa i, Yo La Tengo, Pavement and the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion.\nSupposedly an overview of a decade at the cutting edge of music, I suspect that the marketing people have in some way manipulated the track\nselection to favour bands still putting out records, who are healthily represented, whilst neglecting excellent but defunct bands from nine years a go.I suppose that it is reasonable to expect a label to attract more established\nnames once properly established, but it is slightly disappointing that names\nat the far end of the discography (which is thoughtfully included in the\nsleeve notes) have been omitted.\nFor the trains potters amongst you, one of the CDs contains only tracks that\nwere previously unreleased or available on the b side to the Japanese single version, or some similarly obscure edition. Usually record companies\nhave a good reason for not releasing a song( namely that it is not very\ngood), and this disc is no exception to that rule, despite some above-par\nefforts. It's not even as if avid collectors of any one band will get particularly excited, since the contributions come from fifteen different artists.\nIn fact, this is the main problem with the entire compilation. The musical\nscope of the album is impressively wide and encompasses many, perhaps\ntoo many, styles. Little thought, however, has been given to the running\norder, and the resulting m ish mash is little better than that which the shuffle function on any CD player would come up with. Whilst believing eclecticism to be a good thing, Ido feel that a coherent musical thread running\nthrough the album would render the record more enjoyable.\nHaving said that, it would be unfair to dismiss the album out of hand.\nWithout picking any personal favourites, anyone ought to find something\nto please them from the forty-plus tracks spanning this attractively presented triple-pack. Far from being purely indie-rock, as the reputation of Matador may lead us to believe, the music takes us into the realms of\ndrum'n 'bass, underground hip-hop and left field electronica, which is often\ngood. As expected from such a renowned label, there is quality here. It's just a question of isolating it.\nTop Cat\n!\u2022\u2022\nYazoo\nThe Bestof\n(Label)\nThink back to the early 8 0 s when pop music was proudly synthetic and drum machines sounded like, er, machines. A fat bird and an effete blok e got together\n(via MM classifieds) and produced two albums with some cracking tunes in a productive two-year spell before the inevitable 'musical differences' bit. Vince\nClarke( ex Depeche Mode, and later Erasure) was your man. Alison Moyet was your woman. The two mixed an unlikely\ncombination of electronics and blues with\nsometimes sublime results.\nThis compilation attempts to distil the\nessence of those pioneering times. Three\n1 9 9 9 mixes, including a pumping Todd\nTerry remix of Don't Go are tacked onto\nthe CD to encourage a younger gene r ation to buy, but Ibiza anthems they ain't. Only You sounds like it's aged the least\ngracefully, blame the Flying Pickets for that. Nobody's Diary shows that you can still manage to meld deep soul singing\nand evocative musical hooks and get that\n'recorded on a4 track porta studio' effect.\nProbably aCD for your elder siblings who no longer spin their vinyl copies of\nUpstairs At Eric's or You And Me Both. It\nincludes their highlights and spares us\ntheir really tedious experimental. It's hard\nto imagine Yazoo being given a hearing in\ntoday's formulaic pop world where record\ncompanies feel their prof dits so under\nthreat that anything experimental won't get a fair chance. If your elder sibling\ndoes buy it, be sure to listen. Be sure to\ngive it chance.\nIan\n!\u2022\u2022\n\n"

It's been out almost a week and should be having de tri men tal effects on your degrees by now. Any DC game reviews are welcome, just\nemail' em to felix@ ic.a c.uk August2000 has been pencilled in as the month that\nNintendo will finally unveil\nits new console, presently\nknown as the 'Dolphin', to the public. Whether the press manages to expose the machine before then remains to be seen. The Japanese launch of the Dolphin is slated only 2 months\nlater and industry bigwigs\nalready doubt that this date\nwill be met. For Nintendo's sake s it better, what with the\nheightening competition from Sony, Sega and possibly Microsoft emerging in\nthe new year.\nDonkey Kong64 N in ten do's big Xmas hope for the\nN64 is set to have a variety\nof ancient but ace games included on the cartridge.\nBy solving various puzzles in\nthe main game players will\nunlock the sub games. These include Rare's original Donkey Kong and the Spectrum classic Jet Pac. Viv\nA few years ago ID Software released Doom and changed the face of computer gaming forever. Quake and Quake II followed, each offering the player better graphics and an improved multiplayer experience.\nThe latest game to emerge from the ID Software stable will be Quake/// Arena, a multiplayer fest played over aLAN or the Internet. Mean while ID have released Quake III Test so that they can test the net-working and graphics technology designed for Arena as well as tant a lise gamers worldwide before the final product is released.\nID have always been at the forefront of computer game graphics and Quake III Test introduces a number of new effects such as fog and semi-transparent objects. The weapon trails are much more realistic\nthan in Quake II with smoke following rockets and the plasma gun blistering the walls. The quad damage power up causes blue electricity to ripple across the player's skin. The game has many neat touch es, for example the name of the player you are firing at now appears above their head and the colour of the rail gun trails can be customised. These improved graphics do come at a price. Quake ill Test has the\nhighest system requirements of any game I have seen. It requires a3D accelerator card and a minimum of a Pll 2 3 3 with 6 4 mb of ram. However unless you have a400 mhz computer with 1 2 8 mb of ram and a top flight graphics card you are unlikely to see the game at its best.\nIf there was ever a reason for upgrading... Quake III Test comes with three maps. Two of these are traditional\ndungeon/ castle fare and one is based in space. This adds an extra\nelement of skill as mistimed jumps mean a quick decent into the void. The maps are very good, as you would expect from ID, with a good mix of open spaces for melee, sniping positions and hiding places. All of the higher powered weapons and the special power ups require\nsome skill to reach. To abroad extent lifts on maps have been replaced with jump pads which makes for fast and frantic gaming. Quake II players will not be disappointed. Quake III Test is excellent and with the improvements which ID are planning, Quake III Arena is sure to be a classic.\nMarvel Super heroes vs.\nStreetfighter (PSX)\nSeveral years back a new revelation hit\nthe gaming waves that caused all others\nin its genre to wipeout. That game was Streetfighter. Gr d ph ics and character\nanimation were both critically acclaimed but the true success of the game was due. to the numerous fighting moves and above all the speed of play. The game spawned numerous sequels and Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter is the latest of them all. As the title suggests players can choose to be characters from both the Marvel Comics( such as the\nin famous Spiderman and the imperious\nCaptain America) and the old Streetfighter favourites such as Ryu, D hal is m and Chun Li. The gameplay is essentially the same as the original street fighter with combat played out in 2 D arenas\nbetween two players or one player and a computer opponent. So how does this old concept work in\n1 9 9 9 ? Not so well, it seems. The single\nplayer game tires quickly but there's a laugh to be had in trying to obliterate a pal in versus mode. With such a vast\nlibrary of moves available combined with\nfast-action gameplay its likely you'll\nresort to the random frantic thumping of the joy pad in the hope of executing a special move. Tag-team play is a major\nnew feature that allows the player to switch between two characters during a single bout, although this would be better implemented if four people could play simultaneously. Streetfighter fans\nwill probably find enough from this\ngame not to be disappointed, but for the\nrest of you the 3 D world of Tekken 3 will\noffer much more of a gaming experience. Graeme Viv\n\n"

    "content": "18 October 1999 \u2022 Felix Feedback 9\n* in t In a quiet moment last week, Break point was gazing through the pages of\" London Student\" UL U's very own\" Daily Star\"( complete with former failed politicians ranting on as usual).\nAs I cast the wretched thing aside in favour of my regular Friday\nmorning tussle with Fermat' s Last\nTheorem( I refuse to believe it's as simple as they make out), the headline\" MERGERS PUT SPORT AT RISK\" sprang out at me like a pissed footy ladin dB's on a Frid ay night. The surprising part was the claim that our dear old alma mater has reversed its policy on BUS A entry, and decided to back a\" single entry\" option.( For those unsure, this refers to an anachronism of the medical merger whereby the School of Medicine can enter separate teams into the BUS A competition, instead ot there being just one\" Imperial\" team). The reason given by London Student's in tre pid reporter was\"... to avoid paying two sets of entry fees\". Oh dear, oh dear. Even allowing for the in experience of our current sabbatical masters ( and mistress), this should have been as easy to spot as the Rector in\ndrag at a nICU carnival( for those that didn't see him, it was a sight\nto behold). After all, the hybrid\nsystem (whereby ICS M can enter\nseparately in those sports where it\ncanfield teams, but play for IC teams in those sports - like fencing where there is no medical school team), was formulated by\nthe DP(C& S) of ICU, back in\n1 9 9 7 , and has worked pretty reliably since then. It means- that, like last year,\nthe ICS M Rugby Team, can goon to become National Runners Up in the BUS A competition, and also that medics can captain the notorious IC Fencing Team to similar glory. \u2022\nIn Breakpoint's opinion, BUS A leagues are the only reason for Wednesday afternoon sport to exist at all. Although UL U promised to create competition leagues of a similar standard three years ago, that promise took the famous Male t Street\n\" duck& dive\". If we're forced down the single entry drainpipe, it will only\nmean that less of our students will\nhave the chance to play at national level. Breakpoint's suspicions are that the medics won't be the ones losing out, either.\nBelieve me, if it wasn't for the\npopularity of our clubs and societies, ICU would not exist at all. S her field has proved itself more than capable of running a student\nbar or two. However, sport is one of the few things that still matters deeply to our members, and( in Breakpoint's opinion), our elected representatives should be losing sleep fighting for the rights of all our members to runaround muddy fields chasing odd shaped balls, if they want to. Here we go again just\nanother example of the s a bbs playing politics with people's lives.\nIt's not on for ICU to take these decisions without consulting us, so anybody who remotely cares about sport at I Can dIC SM should be banging on Tim Traile r's office door demanding an explanation. Now. What do you think? E mail\nbreak point l999@ hotmail. com to share your opinions with the rest\nof IC.\nThe central library is undergoing a high-tech\nrevolution. The first Kevin knew of this was when he noticed new flat screen monitors on the issue desk. Kevin was intrigued as to whether this\nimprovement was merely cosmetic, and asked some questions. The Library responded by saying;\" The flat screens are wonderful and take up far less room, so the issue desk is less cluttered.\" The change of image will also result in\nthe clam ou roush and bell being replaced by a new public address system. Kevin expects the hand bell to be preserved in a glass case in the entrance hall. Constituent College Unions got off to a great\nstart, making an excellent impression on their\nnew students. The R CSU held a free BBQ and the Medic's Union succeeded in the brilliant\nfeat of enabling all Fresher' s to. be in the audience of TFI Friday. Kevin is doubtful that the Fresher's first impression of the ICU president was so favourable. Compared to the inspirational speeches by C CUp residents Tasha's performance at the welcomes was pathetic. Claiming to be too ill to stand up, she spoke sitting behind a desk. Whilst speaking she showed that her newfound power had gone to her head, with quotes such as;\" ICU deals with\nthe big guns stuff\" and the very friendly;\" I can ban you, I can fine you, I can get on your nerves.\" She then continued looking for sympathy from the students, by saying that part of her r\" le is to be slated on the front page of Felix. Ms Newton is a medical student.\nMishMash A Mostly Harmless Column by\nKevin, a random entity who\nknows nothing about nothing\nAs many people have pointed out to Kevin, windows in Southside can in fact be fully\nopened. Whilst investigating college's decision to remove the blocks Kevin came across rumours of a RADAR based system which could allegedly identify which room any projectile\nthrown out of a hall window came from. Perh aps this system made the blocks redundant. Such a technological solution to the problem would of course be entirely appropriate here\nat the MIT of Europe. Kevin also learnt of aUR OP( Undergrad u ate Research Opportunities Programme) stud ent working in the Physics department over the summer on a device which involved using\nan array of cunningly located microphones to pinpoint the location of a sound source. The system was designed with the intention of installing it in Southside, to detect the source of loud music. Kevin believes that it is the existence of the\nridiculous music finding device that has given rise to the rumours of the even more imp laus i ble RADAR. Having read the evocative entry in the Fresher's Handbook for the Socialist Worker Stud ent Society Kevin decided to find their stall at\nthe Fresher's Fair. Kevin was hoping to find\nsome non apathetic IC students. Instead he was accosted by a persevering member of the\n' local branch' who had nothing at all to do with IC. Two typical IC students s at meekly behind their desk, from which they were selling\nnewspapers. The SW S S has never been fond of following ICU rules.\nWe all know who toe mail with comments on the state of the Union: president@ ic.a c.uk. For more from Kevin:\nhttp://come.to/mishmash\n\n"

Occasionally getting asked what A Levels I got doesn't help matters much, as I can only\nbarely remember what I actually did, let alone the grades. On the other hand, after a summer of living in a hall that's either empty or full of tour\ngroups who don't speak English, it's nice to have\nsome students around. Diary\nThe queues set in and staff and students everywhere seem to have their mental health balanced on a knife edge. I'm not going to go near the\nUnion today if I can possibly help it. Suddenly\nrealise that I forgot to register last week, so some time soon I'm going to have to do this too. Damn. The Freshers Ball's a laugh though hundreds of\n1 8 year olds on their first night of freedom. Diary\nThe first inklings of Freshers Flu are beginning to\nshow themselves, and I feel yucky. Not helped by\nthe fact that it's Freshers Fair today - sheer mad ness, tempered only by being rushed off my feet\nfor most of the afternoon. Helena wins the \" who can b lag the most free stuff\" contest, collecting\nfour carrier bags full. Andy and Joel decide to\nlaunch a \"find the fittest Fresher contest\".\nDiary\nFrom my point of view, things start to calm down as the new intake head off into their first lecture -poor fools. Start reminiscing about my Freshers\nWeek and suddenly realise that I probably went to\nmore lectures in the first month than in the whole of last year. At lunchtime a million people all seem to want to go to H arlington. I wander how many of them will want to go back? Diary\nThursday can mean only one thing - it's lie in\nday. Mm mm. Freshers don't seem to have\nworked this out yet though, and they're all troo ping into lectures and lab like sheep. I'm sure\nthey'll learn the beauty of the words \"full printed\ncourse notes\" in a couple of weeks. In the evening it's time for the weirdest bit of the week's Ents - one man and his amazingly silly dog. Diary\nFinally it's Friday - one last day and the silliness\nis over for another year. Shame really. Fortunately, before that there's still the Freshers Carnival, which is a perfect opportunity to watch hordes of\npeople destroying what little reputation they had. If you haven't seen Natasha Newton and Kevin\nButcher singing Summer Nights (naturally Kev was Olivia Newton John) you haven't lived.\n\n"
