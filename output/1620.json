Imagine participating in\nsuch events whilst discussing and\nproposing new solutions to the\ninternational issues humanity faces\ntoday. This was only a part of what\nICMUN did in the past week.\nThese past two weekends,\nICMUN has participated in two\nvery renowned MUN conferences:\nOxford International Model\nUnited Nations (OxIMUN) and\nCambridge University International\nModelUnitedNations(CUIMUN).\nIn case you\u2019re confused, Model\nUnited Nations is a forum, within\nwhich delegates represent a country\nin the United Nations committee.\nDelegates work together to address\nvarious international issues. Over\ntwo events, our members were able\nto agree on responses to the Syrian\nrefugee crisis, flight path safety\nassessment (after the crash of the\nRussian airplane in Egypt), and\nmany more contemporary issues.\nThis year ICMUN was able to\nsend its highest ever number of\nChairs to lead the debates at the\nconferences. Our Chairs Enric\nAlcoser, Milia Hasbani, Justus\nL\u00f6bler, Lalit Maganti, Ahmed Raja,\nand Dijana Spasenoska were able\nto ensure committees ran smoothly\nfor both weekends.Furthermore,we\ncould not be prouder of our ICMUN\ndelegation, who persevered in the\nface of headstrong delegates, harsh\nweather conditions, and multiple\nlate nights of MUN parties. Such\ndetermination enabled our very own\ntwo members Ilaria Coppola and\nChris Whitehouse to travel back\nhome with a Best Delegate Award\nand a Diplomacy Award.\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t all business.\nDining in some of the most\nprestigious colleges of Oxford and\nCambridge, dancing to Hotline\nBling and enjoying exclusive\nclub nights in both Oxford and\nCambridge were only some of the\nhighlights of our trips.\nIf you are interested in the United\nNations and how it works, feel free\nto come along to one of our sessions.\nThese are held on Thursdays from\n18:00 \u2013 20:00 in Skempton 307. No\nprior MUN experience is required.\nIf you want to be one of the future\nleaders in politics, business or any\nThe Imperial delegates at Cambridge University International MUN 2015 Photo Credit: Nil Bozkurt\nNil Bozkurt\nWriter\nModel United Nations hit Oxbridge\nThey danced to Drake and formulated policy\nother industry \u2013 or if you\u2019re just\nlooking to develop your soft skills \u2013\ncome by or write to us to find out\nmore about what we do!\nLive in very vibrant colour\nI\nt\u2019s always a good sign when\nyou look back on your week\nand realise that you definitely\nspent more hours in rehearsals\nthan on your degree. We\u2019re at\nImperial. My course averages 7\nhours of contact time most days.\nSo, that\u2019s not exactly a meaningless\nstatement. But, that\u2019s just the world\nof theatre.\nAt the beginning of term,\nand having taken a year out, I\nwas altogether too enthusiastic\nabout returning to my studies.\nI auditioned for pretty much\neverything going. This meant that\nI ended up conning my way into\nthe cast for both Musical Theatre\u2019s\n\u2018Revue: Live in Living Colour\u2019 and\nDramSoc\u2019s \u2018Neverwhere\u2019, which\nconveniently have their show weeks\none after the other.\nIn all four years that I\u2019ve been\nhere, I have never had so much fun\nor so little sleep. The talent of every\nsingle person I\u2019ve worked with so far\nis truly incredible,and I\u2019m so excited\nfor both of the shows.\nOf course, I don\u2019t actually get to\nwatch the shows when I\u2019m singing,\ndancing, acting or some terrible\ncombination of the three. So it\u2019s\ndown to you to come and tell\nme if they\u2019re any good. From my\nend they\u2019re looking pretty snazzy,\nthough.They should do,too,because\nI\u2019m pretty sure some of our directors\nhaven\u2019t been to sleep in a fortnight.\nWe\u2019ve bounced from run-throughs\nto rehearsal, to tech-runs and dress\nrehearsals, and occasionally to\nPrimark and Poundland to pick up\nvarious bits of costume at the last\nminute.\nIf you have the chance to audition,\ndo it! Just, maybe don\u2019t audition for\neverything, if you actually want to\npass your degree this year.\nAbigail de Bruin\nC&S Editor\nMusical Theatre Revue cast. Photo Credit: Chads Chadwick\nI\nt\u2019s obvious when you think\nabout it, but still slightly odd:\nmore than half of people\ninvolved in theatre never\nmake it on stage. A further four\npeople are on stage, but exclusively\nwhen the lights are off. In almost\nevery play, actors are truly the tip of\nthe iceberg. Most people know very\nlittle about backstage work (which\nis, perhaps, the point), but after\nworking in it things become a little\nclearer.\nI\u2019m involved with stage\nmanagement, the people in black\nwho move things around on stage.\nTheir work kicks off with the\ncreation of \u201cthe book\u201d, which is\nto the stage manager as the Bible\nis to God. It\u2019s a copy of the script,\nbut with absolutely everything you\nneed to know to put on a play: the\ntiming for lights and sound, where\nthe actors will be, what the stage\nhands will be doing, and literally\neverything else.\nThe book is then given to the\ndeputy stage manager, who sits\nin a perch overlooking the stage.\nThey instruct lighting, sound and\nset over radio. At first, this was a\nnerve-racking experience for me.\nA wrongly placed cue can really\ndisrupt a play. Once, I asked for\na phone noise and instead got\na clip from the Backstreet Boys.\nFortunately, the nerves quickly give\nway to a sense of megalomania.\nLooking down on a play and\nhaving light, sound and people coordinating to your voice can really\nbe a thrill.\nThen you have the stage hands.\nThis is a great way to get involved\nwithout committing too much time,\nand to see if you\u2019d like to do more\nin future.\nAnd if you don\u2019t want the pressure\nof being there when the play is on,\nthere\u2019s still plenty to do.\nPossibly the most labour intensive\npart of production is making the set,\nwhich is ideally done before the play\nstarts showing. This is more time\nconsuming than you would believe,\nso DramSoc often finishes about\nhalf an hour before the curtains\nopen, but we go with what works.\nThe job normally involves sawing,\nglueing and nailing, to the point\nwhere DramSoc has a workshop\ndirectly under the stage.\nThere\u2019s also costume design\nand creation. We have a small but\nskilled group who make costumes\nfrom scratch, but complicated or\nimportant costumes are normally\nrented from the National Theatre.\nJust visiting their storeroom is\nan experience \u2013 there are literally\nthousands of costumes, ordered by\nNeverwhere crew: what do they do?\nOscar Tucker\nWriter\nG\netting lost on the way to\nan audition and turning\nup half an hour late\nis never the best way\nto make a first impression. Even\nfor the loudest, bubbliest, most\nshameless person, the audition\nprocess is daunting. When you\nfactor in poor punctuality, relatively\nlittle acting experience and the\ngeneral dazed bewilderment of a\nfresher, you can\u2019t expect to get very\nfar. And yet, for some reason it was\ndecided that I was suitable for the\nrole of a vile, ruthless, deranged\nkiller. Out of context, this may not\nseem very pleasant, but I couldn\u2019t\nfeel luckier. Having the chance to\nperform again has been amazing,\nand in my excitement I devoured\nthe script as soon as I got a copy \u2013\nwhich did happen to be very late at\nnight (or very early in the morning,\nhowever you want to look at it), and\nbefore a 9am. It was worth it.\nNeil Gaiman\u2019s \u2018Neverwhere\u2019 has\na variety of outlandish characters,\nand seeing them brought to life\nduring rehearsal has been incredibly\ninteresting. As someone who has\nnot acted in two years, it\u2019s been\nrefreshing to start over, seeing how\nother people take to characters\nand how our director (Helen\nRoot) interprets them. The dark\nnature of the play has lent itself to\nan exploration of different acting\ntechniques \u2013 things that I certainly\nhave never tried before. A highlight\nwas the stage combat workshop. I\nhave never been part of a fight scene\nbefore, and learning how to kick,\npunch and otherwise attack a fellow\nactor was exhilarating. For those\nwondering, this doesn\u2019t mean that\nDramSoc members know how to\nbeat people up. As one of the stage\ncombat tutors said, if he got into a\nreal fight, at best he could throw a\nfake punch and confuse the assailant\nfor long enough to run away.\nGaiman is known for writing dark,\nbizarre stories \u2013 but all of them,\nNeverwhere included, contain a\ntouch of humour. The character\u2019s\npersonalities are therefore brilliant\nto play with. Whether the laughter\ncomes from being utterly grotesque,\nsarcastic, scathing, or just really,\nreally pathetic, it\u2019s always satisfying\nwhen the comic timing is right on\npoint.\nAs for rehearsals, they are some\nof the most fun I have had since\nstarting at Imperial. After a stressful\nseries of lectures, or a lab where\nnothing seems to go right, nothing\nDaisy Rogers-Simmons\nWriter\nThe Neverwhere cast speak\ncheers me up like a rehearsal. I\u2019ve\nmet some lovely people and made\ngreat friends.\nIf you haven\u2019t seen the teaser\ntrailer for Neverwhere, check it\nout. It\u2019s downright badass \u2013 and\nit took a day of makeup, shooting\nand recording to put together. As\nsomeone who was a part of it, it was\nreally exciting to get into costume\nfor the first time, though it made\nthe show seem a lot more real and a\nlot closer, which did make me panic\na little. It\u2019s been a real challenge to\nbalance line learning and rehearsal\nwith starting a degree, and has also\nshown me just how little sleep I\nneed if I have coffee.Saying this,I\u2019ve\nloved being a part of \u2018Neverwhere\u2019,\nand all I can say now is bring on\nshow week.\nera.\nThe final touch on a costume is\nstage makeup. Lights on stage are\nfamously harsh, so actors all have a\nthick layer of foundation, eyeliner\nand lots of contouring. It\u2019s a great\nway to release your inner Kim K.\nWorking backstage is stressful,\ndifficult, but ultimately great fun.\nIt\u2019s a weird perk that each play has\nTwo very menacing cast members Photo Credit: Cem Hurrell\nits own specific roles. For example,\nNeverwhere has \u201cBeast Creator\u201d\nand a stop-motion artist in its crew.\nDramSoc always needs more help,\nso if any of the above sounds like\nfun, please get involved \u2013 email\ndramasoc@ic.ac.uk.\nWe are still looking for stage\nhands for Neverwhere or any of the\nabove roles for shows next term.\nWe have\na small\nbut skilled\ngroup\nAll I can\nsay now\nis bring on\nshow week!\n\n"

The\nauthor alludes to the fact that the\nactions and beliefs of some of the\nmore extreme schools of feminism\nnot only dissuade people from\nassociating with the title, but also\nare often used by opponents of\nfeminism to diminish the whole\nmovement.\nI would like to share an idea,\nwhich I hope the Angry Grad and\nothers adopt, in order to tear down\nthis common straw-man fallacy\nand evade some of the mistargeted\ncriticism that the majority of\nfeminists face. It all comes down to\na matter of precision.\nSaying \u2018I\u2019m a feminist\u2019 really\nsays very little about one\u2019s\nideological standpoint. It is no\nmore descriptive than saying \u2018 I\u2019m\na Labour supporter\u2019. Well are you\na Blairite or a Corbynite? These\nviews are incredibly different, often\ncontradictory and only loosely\nrelated. The more extreme schools\nof feminism (radical, French,\nseparatist etc) generally call for the\nwhole-scale change of the structure\nof society, whereas liberal feminism\npredominately strive for gender\nequality in the current society from\na universal-rights based standpoint.\nMany people would feel deeply\nuncomfortable associating with the\nmore extreme views, and one can\nsee how \u201cI\u2019m a feminist\u201d could be\ninterpreted in all manner of ways.\nAs such, there is much to be gained\nby being more precise about our\nviews.\nMost people who describe\nthemselves as \u201cfeminist\u201d mean\n\u201cliberal feminist\u201d. This stems\nfrom the idea of equality for all,\nirrespective of gender, race, religion,\ndisability, sexual-preference etc.\nwhich is (thankfully) something\non which most people can agree. I\nfall into this category and I suspect\nAngry Grad does too.\nCurrently the liberal feminists\ndo not identify strongly enough.\nWe allow the extremes of any\nmovement to yell louder, dominate\nthe headlines and often tarnish the\nreputation of the whole movement.\nThis is putting off would-be\nsympathisers and allowing the\nopposition to tar all feminists with\nthe same brush.\nIf we want to see the income gap\ndisappear and an equal number of\nwomen in positions of power, then\nthe mainstream movement needs\nto identify themselves as such. It\nbegins with each liberal feminist\nidentifying themselves and spreads\nuntil we have a critical mass.\n@Nas Andriopoulos\nA classical liberal and liberal\nfeminist\nI wouldn\u2019t dare put words in\nAngry Grad\u2019s mouth, mate. She\u2019s\nwell scary.\n-Ed.\nIn response to \u2018Union spends five\ngrand on desk\u2019, Issue 1619\n[REDACTED] has got the\ntrustee board to increase his wages\nto over \u00a380k while other staff were\nmade redundant to cut costs. Long\nterm staff were let go and replaced\nwith inexperienced new people in\nthe name of cutting staff wages.\nThis is just a small example of the\ncontrol exerted by the top bosses at\nthe union while they hide behind\n\u201cstudent trustees\u201d. The truth is\nour sabbs do nothing but seal and\nstamp on what they want to do.\nThis is why a lot of major changes\ntake place over summer before the\nnew sabbs completely know what\u2019s\nhappening. There is a real focus on\nincreasing revenue to make all this\nseem worthwhile, which is why\nFiveSixEight makes over \u00a3250k a\nyear in profit.This is the money that\nthe union says they invest in clubs,\nbut club money is provided in grant\nby the college.

Both women are\nisolated, cut off from any passion by\ntheir neglectful husbands, and find\nsolace in each other.The unflinching\ndepiction of homosexuality seen\nin the film sparked protests across\nIndia, leading to debates about\nfreedom of speech, the role of\nreligion in society, and the social\nfabric of the country. If nothing\nelse, that would be the mark of\na groundbreaking film, but Fire\ngoes beyond this, with nuanced\nperformances from the central cast\nmaking Radha and Sita a couple\nburning with desire.\nAgnes and Elin\nin Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l\n(1998)\nThe directorial breakthrough of\nSwedish director Lukas Moodysson,\nFucking \u00c5m\u00e5l follows two teenage\ngirls living in backwater Sweden\nwho develop a relationship. Agnes\n(Rebecka Liljeberg) is a depressed\nloner, with few true friends; Elin\n(Alexandra Dahlstr\u00f6m) is more\nBetty and Rita\nin Mulholland\nDrive (2001)\nI mean, does anyone really\nunderstand what this film is about?\nWidely considered the masterwork\nof American auteur David Lynch\n\u2013 commonly regarded as one of the\ngreatest directors working today \u2013\nNic and Jules in\nThe Kids are All\nRight (2010)\nNominated for the Best Picture\nAcademy Award in 2010, Lisa\nCholodenko\u2019s The Kids are All Right\nis unusual in some ways, in that it\nshows a lesbian couple who have\nbeen together for years, rather than\ndepicting the start of a relationship.\nJules (Julianne Moore) and Nic\n(Annette Bening) are married with\ntwo children, living in LA. But\nwhen their children track down\ntheir sperm donor father, Paul\n(Mark Ruffalo), strains are put\non their relationship, and hidden\ntensions begin to emerge. With\nexcellent performances from the\nwhole cast, The Kids are All Right is\na warm, witty gem of a drama film.\nAnd if that\u2019s not enough to tempt\nyou, there\u2019s a scene where Nic sings\nJoni Mitchell\u2019s \u2018All I Want\u2019 \u2013 what\nmore could you need in a film?\nEmma and\nAd\u00e8le in Blue\nis the Warmest\nColour (2013)\nBursting onto our screens in 2013,\nBlue is the Warmest Colour,Abdellatif\nKechiche\u2019s 5th\nfilm, made history\nwhen lead actors L\u00e9a Seydoux and\nAd\u00e8le Exarchopoulos were awarded\nthe Palme d\u2019Or along with Kechiche\nat the 66th\nCannes Film Festival,\nfor their performances as Emma\nand Ad\u00e8le respectively. Based on\nthe graphic novel by Julie Maroh,\nthe film garnered widespread\nEvelyn and\nCynthia in\nThe Duke of\nBurgundy\n(2014)\nIt\u2019s rare to find a film that\ncombines lesbian relationships,\nBDSM, and research into moths,\nbut Peter Strickland\u2019s third feature\nfilm The Duke of Burgundy manages\nto do just that. Following on from\nhis masterful Berbarian Sound\nStudio (2012), based on Italian\ngiallo films, Strickland took his\ncues from 1970s eurotrash erotica\nfor this exploration of relationships.\nSidse Babett Knudsen (of Borgen\nfame) plays Cynthia,the older,more\ndominant one of the relationship,\nwhile Chiara D\u2019Anna is Evelyn,\nthe young ing\u00e9nue. However,\nthings aren\u2019t as they seem, and the\nfilm undermines the traditional\nnarrative, and takes things into\nmore philosophical territory. With\nsumptuous visuals, brilliant acting,\nand a cracking score from Cat\u2019s\nEyes, this is a must-watch.\nFRED FYLES\noutgoing, but full of ennui, and\nunsatisfied with life. The two come\ntogether after Agnes\u2019 16th\nbirthday\nparty, a horrifically embarrassing\nexperience for shy Agnes; they\nbelieve the key to living a good life\nwould be leaving their small town of\n\u00c5m\u00e5l and making it to Stockholm\n\u2013 the town of \u00c5m\u00e5l took offence\nto this portrayal, and in English\nthe film is called Show Me Love. A\ntender portrayal of the turbulence of\nteenage sexuality, Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l is a\nmust-watch.\nthis film is completely batshit crazy.\nA brunette woman escapes from a\ncar crash, making her way to safety\nin a house in LA; suffering from\namnesia she takes on the name of\nRita,and surprises Betty,whose aunt\nowns the house. As Betty tries to\nhelp Rita remember what happened\nto her, the bonds between the two\nwomen strengthens, leading to\nconsummation of the relationship,\nand a visit to the mysterious Club\nSilencio. Way more stuff happens,\nand I would need to see it at least\nseven more times to properly\nunderstand what\u2019s going on.

Both white\ndominated genres.\nProvocative visuals flash behind\nhim as he performs: three inverted\nKu Klux Klan members loom\nagainst a white background, their\ntraditionally white uniform flipped\nblack. The imagery continues in the\nB&W \u2018BLKKK SKKKN HEAD\u2019\nmusic video, where naked CGI\nKanyes of various shapes and size\nspaz out to the tune.The video ends\nwith five black men in black KKK\nhoods advancing on the viewer.\nAnother instance of white racism\nstained black; disarmed.\nThe SNL performance mimics\nthat of a rock star. Ye\u2019s intensity\nburns through the screen as he\nwields the mic stand, studded\nleather jacket contentiously worn\nover a low-cut t-shirt.The \u2018rock star\u2019\nis another exclusively white concept\nthat Kanye\u2019s been trying to sort out.\nHe\u2019s repeatedly appointing himself\nthe title of \u2018greatest living rock\nstar,\u2019 even screaming it repeatedly\nin the face of an overwhelming\nwhite crowd of near 100 thousand\n(at Glastonbury at that - a festival\nwith roots entrenched firmly in\nrock & roll). The dude\u2019s persona\nis the closest thing we have to the\nrock stars of old in pop culture (by\na LONG shot), so why\u2019s everyone\ngetting so pissed off? \u2018Rap\u2019s the new\nfeature listed on the track list is\n\u2018God,\u2019 on the track \u2018I Am a God.\u2019\nThe song features such absurdities\nas \u2018In a French-ass restaurant.\nHurry up with my damn croissants!\nI am a God.\u2019If said by anyone other\nthan Ye, nobody\u2019d be doubting their\ninsincerity. He knows this; dude\u2019s\ntoying with how the public perceives\nhim. America\u2019s bred a culture of\nself-hatred into its black populace.\nEveryone\u2019s happy with black\nmusicians referring to themselves\nas gangsters, drug dealers, n*ggas\u2026\nBut a god? Ye\u2019s inverted hyperbole\naims to incite rage.\nBy adopting the moniker \u2018Yeezus\u2019,\nKanye\u2019s inserting himself further\ninto white iconography: a quick\nglance through Christian artwork\nhighlights Jesus as the most\nrecognisable white figure in the\nentire world.The concept\u2019s extended\nin his Yeezus tour theatrics, where\n\u2018White Jesus\u2019 comes on stage for a\nquick what-up.\nKanye is repeatedly highlighting\nhis blackness by inserting it into\neverywhere society tells him it\ndoesn\u2019t belong. Black timbs all in\nyour couch again. Black dick all in\nyour spouse again.\n\u201cSoon as they like you, make \u2018em\nunlike you.\u201d\nA great deal of effort has gone\ninto making \u2018Bound 2\u2019 unlikeable\nand it worked: it\u2019s the 8th\nmost\ndisliked video on YouTube, ever.\nWhen the original (much shittier)\n\u2018Hooked On a Feeling\u2019 video has a\n10 to 1 like-to-dislike ratio with a\nfifth of the views of \u2018Bound 2,\u2019 you\ncan\u2019t help but wonder whether the\nracial overtones played a hand in its\ninfamy.\nIt\u2019s clear that Kanye doesn\u2019t\nmind exposing himself to ridicule.\nHe became the first mainstream\nartist in a hyper-masculine genre\nto expose himself emotionally,\nmourning the demise of both his\nmother and engagement on the\nnew-wave autotuned record 808s\nand Heartbreaks. A quick glance\nthrough his previous music videos\nshows he knows how to make a\ngood one; the gorgeous self-directed\n\u2018Runaway\u2019 film speaks for itself. It\u2019s\npretty insulting to think that he\nlacks the self-awareness to realise\nhow tasteless \u2018Bound 2\u2019 looks.\nWhich leads me to question his\noval office aspirations. Running\nagainst an incumbent president\nis political suicide, and I don\u2019t\nthink Kanye winning a nationwide\npopularity contest is going to\nhappen anytime soon. When asked\nabout his policy ideas directly after\nthe announcement, a rare smile\nescaped: \u2018Everybody gets Yeezys.\u2019\nYEEZY2020 highlighted the\ninsanity of an unqualified celebrity\nthinking he can run the U.S.A.\nSomething topical starting with T\nand ending with P(rick) springs to\nmind.\n\u201cPop culture tries to force-feed a\ndumbed down version of everything.\nPeople try to act like the fans are\ndumb.\u201d\nFrom crashing ballet and hip-hop\ntogether in \u2018Runaway\u2019 to taking\ninspiration from the Alejandro\nJodorowsky directed arthouse film\n\u2018The Holy Mountain\u2019 for the Yeezus\ntour, Kanye\u2019s been bringing fine art\nto pop culture in an progressively\nmore mature manner. October saw\nthe first release of his collaboration\nwith Pulitzer Prize winning\ncomposer Caroline Shaw. The\nrework of \u2018Say You Will\u2019 employs\nher voice as a string instrument:\npuckering pizzicato vocals flutter\naround Kanye\u2019s autotuned laments\nbefore swelling in a jaw-droppingly\nserene crescendo. It\u2019s pretty damn\ngood.\nDoes an artist have to subscribe\nto our preconceived notions of how\nthey should look, act or talk like in\norder to deserve our respect? The\nnotion that popularity automatically\nequates to unsophistication is\nirritatingly snobbish. Applying\nsemiotics to Kanye West\u2019s post-Swiftgate output opens up bounds\nof subtext (check out his SNL-40 or\nDNC performance- I could go on\nabout his subversive trolling of the\nGlastonbury audience).\nPeople love to laugh at the\napparent stupidity of others.\nEntertainers have been exploiting\nthis idea for ages- just look at\nclowns and marketing maestro DJ\nKhaled. It\u2019s far easier to poke fun at\nKanye\u2019s eccentricities than to take\nhim seriously as an artist. Almost\ntoo easy.\nBut what if he\u2019s inviting us to\nmake fun of him?\n\u201cThink you\u2019re laughin\u2019at me? Nah,\nnah, I laugh at y\u2019all/ \u2026. /All they\nshit they talk, all the shit they write,\noh, I love it.\u201d\nSomething funny about Kanye, again. Photo Credit: Normal Mag\nThe hood Jodorowsky. Photo Credit: Kanye West and David Hasselhoff\nrock n roll.\u2019\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t get ran out by Catholics/\nHere come some conservative\nBaptists\u201d\nBack to the album. The only\nWhat if\nhe\u2019s\ninviting us\nto make\nfun\nof him?\nI\nam a pop artist. My medium is\npublic opinion, and the world\nis my canvas.\u201d\nAs the most despised figure\nof today\u2019s pop culture pantheon,\nyou\u2019d think Mr. Michelangelowith-a-mic would know how to use\nhis medium better.\nBut what if we take him seriously?\n\u201cI am standing up and telling\nyou: I am Warhol. I am the number\none most impactful artist of our\ngeneration.\u201d\nWhen persistent tall talk like\nthis makes Kanye\u2019s diamond-gated\nmouth sound like my arse after a\nsuper-noodle binge,taking anything\nhe says seriously is a pretty big ask.\nBut, what if he\u2019s right? What if\nhe\u2019s actually what he claims to be\u2013 a\nLouis Vuitton garbed Lichtenstein?\nThe dude makes really fucking\ngood music. That\u2019s a pretty safe\nstatement (if this upsets u hmu 4\na good otolaryngologist). Outside\nof that he\u2019s kind of a walking\npunchline. Anyone who knows me\nwill know I\u2019m pretty avid advocate\nof Team-Yeezy (avid/obsessive;\npotay-to/potah-to), so I\u2019m here to\nexpose the truth.\nKanye West is a criminally\nunderrated post-modern\nperformance artist.\nI know how this sounds (believe\nme, my mates have made sure I\nknow EXACTLY how it sounds),\nbut bear with me. Let\u2019s start with\nan example - the \u2018Bound 2\u2019 music\nvideo. If you haven\u2019t seen it, the\nvideo begins with cheesy stock\nlandscape clips before switching\nbetween Kanye awkwardly dancing\nand Kanye awkwardly riding a\nmotorcycle (often accompanied\nby the beloved millennial form of\nMary Magdalen, Kim Kardashian\nWest). All scenes are shot against\na poorly disguised green screen,\nproviding colourfully stylized (but\nultimately trashy) backdrops to\nKimye\u2019s shenanigans. The video\u2019s\nracked up a tidy 400,000 dislikes on\nYouTube; the people aren\u2019t a fan.\nThe people have missed the point.\n\u2018Bound 2\u2019 is a genius inversion of\nthe \u2018Hooked on a Feeling\u2019 music\nvideo by newly renamed DavidHoff\n(he wanted to \u2018drop the Hassle\u2019from\nhis name - no, seriously, google it),\nits release and reception all part of a\ndevilishly sly performance art piece\naiming to highlight and disarm\nAmerica\u2019s latent cultural racism.\n\u2018Hooked on a Feeling\u2019are uncannily\nsimilar. Take any Bound 2 shot, and\nyou can find a corresponding shot in\n\u2018Feeling\u2019 with the exact same colour\ngradient.\nThe whole fake motorcycle is\nstraight from \u2018Feeling.\u2019 Kanye\u2019s odd\nexpressions when he busts in after\nthe intro? Imitating Hasselhoff\u2019s\nok-Mitch-it \u2019s-time-to-looksexy stare at the start of \u2018Feeling.\u2019\nKanye spreading his wings in an\ninexplicable G-6 impression? Also\nstraight from the Hoff.\nAs science boffins we can all agree\nthat correlation does not imply\ncausation, so let\u2019s dig a little deeper.\nDuring the \u2018hooga hooga ooga\nchaka\u2019 refrain of \u2018Feeling,\u2019 footage of\na sunglasses clad Hasselhoff runs in\nthe background. His t-shirt\u2019s tucked\ninto his pulled up cargo shorts as he\nprances around a group of African\ntribesmen. Dude\u2019s looking pretty\ncool. A second Hasselhoff (let\u2019s call\nhim Hoff-B) also appears, bopping\naround with a tribal weaponry,\notherwise kitted out in safari gear.\nIt\u2019s as if Hoff-B, singing \u2018ooga\nooga,\u2019 brandishing native weapons,\nis taunting the Africans by inserting\nhimself into their culture.\n\u201cThey see a black man with a white\nwoman at the top floor, they gone\ncome to kill King Kong/Middle\nAmerica packed in/Came to see me\nin my black skin\u201d\nNow in Bound 2, Kanye is either\ndressed in lumberjack attire or a\nwhite-trash t shirt. Also exclusive\nAslan Sayfimehr\nWriter\ndark as possible, while the opposite\nstands for Kim: contrasting their\nskin tones, highlighting their super-publicized interracial relationship.\nThe video was debuted on the Ellen\nDeGeneres Show: a talk show\nmost successful in the middle-aged\nwhite female demographic. Hardly\nKanye\u2019s target audience\u2026 So why\nall the theatrics?\nKanye West has brilliantly\nreversed \u2018Hooked On A Feeling,\u2019\nappropriating Americana culture\nand taunting \u2018middle America\u2019 with\nscenes of a black man riding into\nthe sunset with his Caucasian wife.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my flag now- now what you\ngonna do?\u201d\nLater that year, Kanye started\nrocking the confederate flag. A\nmainstay of redneck iconography,\nthis stirred up quite a fuss, pissing\noff both racists and those who\u2019d\nactually experienced racism at its\nhands. Whether appropriate or not,\nby adopting the historically racist\nlogo, Kanye\u2019s made strides towards\ndisarming it, drawing parallels with\nthe appropriation of n*gger. There\nseems to be a theme here.\n\u201cBut the guy really, really, really\nis talented\u2026 No one\u2019s near doing\nwhat he\u2019s doing, it\u2019s not even on the\nsame planet.\u201d- Lou Reed on Yeezus\nKanye\u2019s pretty Lynchian in the\nopacity of his art; what little he\u2019s\ndivulged about his 6th\nLP Yeezus\nhas amounted to \u2018fashion world\nmarginalisin me cos im black NEW\nSLAVES fuk u hedi slimane.\u2019\nYeezus has had people stumped for\na while, but looking at the album\nthrough the lens of a black man\nappropriating inaccessible white\nculture starts to clear the fog.\nYe\u2019s made an angry, controversial\nrecord in frustration at his inability\nto break into the fashion industry.\nAs an outspoken black man, he\nfelt he couldn\u2019t insert himself\ninto the fashion world, so he\u2019s\ninserting himself into anything\nand everything else that\u2019s similarly\nuncharted territory.\nThe track \u2018Black Skinhead\u2019\n(paradox much?) was first heard\nwith a ferocious performance live\non SNL. Sonically, the song\u2019s closer\nto rock than hip-hop; cavernous\ndrums chug away around a gnarly\nguitar-riff while Marilyn Mansonesque gasps provide the essential\nearworm. Kanye gets his scream on;\nSomething funny about Kanye. Photo Credit: SNL\n\u201cBlack timbs all on your couch\nagain/Black dick all in your spouse\nagain\u201d\nThe visuals of \u2018Bound 2\u2019 and\nto Bound 2 are the scenes of Kanye\nand Kim having as much fun as\nyou can have without your clothes\non sur le moto. Pay attention to\nthe lighting in the video; Kanye\u2019s\nfeatures are consistently lit to be as\nIt\u2019s clear\nthat Kanye\ndoesn\u2019t\nmind\nexposing\nhimself to\nridicule\nKanye\nWest\nhas\nbrilliantly\nreversed\n\u2018Hooked\nOn A\nFeeling\u2019\n\n"

Here\u2019s what went down.\nI\nC Radio: On a scale of\nAbraham Lincoln to Donald\nTrump, how would you rate\nyour ability as President?\nLucinda: Probably more towards\nAbraham Lincoln. If Trump was 1\nand Lincoln 10, 6.5.\nIC Radio: So if you were\npresident of the world you wouldn\u2019t\nbe launching nuclear attacks on\neveryone?\nL: Oh, no.\nIC Radio: That\u2019s good to hear.\nThis was a user submitted question:\nwhat\u2019s your go to meal to cook at\nhome?\nL: Um, sticky Lime and Ginger\nChicken.\nIC Radio: This is user submitted\nso don\u2019t judge us. If you could keep\none of music or sex, which would\nyou keep?\nL: Sex, sorry Mum.\nIC Radio: What\u2019s your go-to\nselfie face?\nL: I don\u2019t take selfies. I always\nsmile though, I can\u2019t take pictures\nwithout smiles.\nIC Radio: One horse sized duck,\nor 100 duck sized horses?\nL: 100 duck sized horses. I think\nhaving a load of little ducks running\naround would be really cute.\nIC Radio: How much work does\nImperial have to do to improve\nGender Equality? The Physics\ndepartment forwarded an email to\nthe year which encouraged students\nto attend a freshers lunch in order\nto stake a claim on one in five girls.\nThat example was included on a\nbook about sexism in Universities.\nL: It varies. Obviously in the\nsporting world there\u2019s a lot more\nwork to do, for example the events\nat varsity last year as well. In general\nterms, not that much, but I think\nmore respect needs to be shown\ntowards women, especially if you\nstep forward and put yourself in\nthe limelight, I\u2019ve experienced that\nmyself.\nIt depends what sector you look\nat, but it definitely is getting there.\nICRadio:Is there an undercurrent\nof tolerance, even encouragement,\nof sexist, misogynistic behaviour in\nImpeiral Sports clubs and can you\ndo anything to change that? Last\nyear, a Sport Imperial employee\nat the Varsity spoke on the Rugby\nGirls saying,\u201cI don\u2019t care how those\nfat girls get home\u201d. Do you agree\nthat there is an undercurrent of\nsexism in sport at Imperial?\nL: I think there is, but I think the\nissue comes with group mentality\nand drinking. I think if we\u2019re\ngoing to use boys as an example\nwithin their teams, then I know a\nlot of guys who play sport and are\nvery nice people, but the minute\nyou put them together in a group\nmentality and drinking\u2026 I think it\nalso extends, because they\u2019re quite\ntraditional societies; it extends\nfrom back in the day when sexism\nwas ok. Horrible as it sounds, and I\nhate saying that, but it was. Now it\u2019s\nbeing clamped down on, but I think\nit still extends from that, it\u2019s a group\nmentality.\nIC Radio: Is that an excuse?\nL: It\u2019s not an excuse, but it\u2019s\nsomething that will take a while to\nwork on.\nIC Radio: Is there anything you\ncan do about it?\nL: We can. At the beginning of\nour club officer training we showed\ninequality videos. There are steps\nthat we can take to try and ensure\nthings are better.\nIC Radio: Last year there was\na rugby scandal. For those of you\nthat don\u2019t know, basically there was\na game where the rugby players on\nthe way home from training had to\nget off the tube, strip off as much as\npossible, and then get back on the\ntube \u2013 a drinking game.\nThe way the president at the\ntime, Tom Wheeler, dealt with this\nwas sanctions. But there was a big\nbacklash from doing that, a lot of\ncriticism over him doing that.I want\nto ask you: do you agree with what\nhe did, or do you think he deserves\nthe criticism he receives and would\nyou do anything differently if that\nhappened this year?\nL: I think he handled it amazingly\nwell. I think the way that he did\nit... obviously as the union we are\nthere to protect the students from\neverything. We\u2019re there to make\nsure the media don\u2019t get hold of it,\nthe police don\u2019t get hold of anything,\nthat every single student is fine with\ntheir future lives and all that sort of\nthing; that there\u2019s nothing on the\nrecord.\nHe dealt with it very well because\nit stayed internally. Yes, he might\nhave got a backlash but it stayed\ninternal and there was nothing that\nwent out. I think he dealt with it\nvery well in that respect. You have\nto discipline people to make them\nunderstand that it\u2019s not ok, but they\ndidn\u2019t come out of it badly.\nIC Radio: Some people say that\nsabb positions, like the one you\u2019ve\ngot, like the one Grace Rahman, the\nFELIX Editor has got, are only run\nfor people that have got careerist\nambitions, people looking to put\nsomething on their CV. Are you a\ncareerist?\nL: I think everyone at Imperial\nis, but that isn\u2019t the reason why I\nran. I ran because I have been quite\nheavily involved in different areas\nof the Union in my time here. I\nreally enjoy doing this sort of stuff. I\nwouldn\u2019t have run or put the amount\nof effort I did when I was running\nif I wanted it for a career reason.\nI could have spent my summers,\ninstead of doing things for RCSU,\ndoing internships, but I didn\u2019t. I\nreally enjoy helping students out, I\nknow it sounds very clich\u00e9d because\nthe president is saying that, but\nI genuinely do. When students\ncome up to me and says: \u201cYou\u2019ve\nmade quite a big difference with\nthis, thank you for your help\u201d, I feel\nreally good about myself. So I didn\u2019t\ndo it for that reason, I did it because\nI really wanted to help, but I think\neveryone at Imperial looks after\ntheir careers as well.\nIC Radio: Do you have any\nparticular advice for someone that\u2019s\nrunning for a sabb position?\nL: I would say, think carefully\nabout the position you want to run\nfor.If you\u2019re deciding between a few,\nthink about the experiences that\nyou have behind those,as they differ\na lot. Ask the current sabbs, that\u2019s\nthe best way to find information.\nTry really hard to put something\ntogether that\u2019s really unique and\ninnovative, as you don\u2019t want to be\nmaking the same promises as last\nyear.\nIC Radio: When you ran for\nUnion President, you ran as a\nwoman running in a STEM subject\nonly university where 69% of the\nstudents are men. Did you ever\nsuffer any sexist abuse? How did\nthat make you feel, what was your\nresponse? Do you think you need a\ntough skin to be a sabb officer?\nL: Yes I did [suffer sexist abuse].\nAt first it made me feel really\nterrible, it really, really did, but\nthen I had a lot of people saying,\njust ignore it, that is what is going\nto happen. I spoke to a few female\nold sabbs or people who ran for\nsabb positions before I did, and they\nsaid, \u201cas a word of warning, people\naren\u2019t going to judge you on you\nmanifesto points, they are going to\njudge you on how you look and how\nyou present yourself because you\u2019re\nfemale.\u201d So I had that instinctive,\nyou know, this is going to happen\nto me. So at first I did feel rubbish,\nbut my friends and campaign team\nreminded me [that this would\nhappen]. You do have to have very\nthick skin I think. People are going\nto hold you accountable for a lot of\nthings, people are going to lay into\nyou about some things that they are\nnot happy with. There is a lot, and\nI know people talk about you a lot\nas well. You obviously hope people\ntry and talk about you in a good\nlight, but sometimes it\u2019s not. I know\nsometimes a lot of people vent their\nanger and say things like, \u2018Oh the\nsabbs have done this and the sabbs\nhave done that\u2019, so yes, you do\nhave to have thick skin, and that\u2019s\nsomething I now have got. I didn\u2019t\nhave a thick skin as such before I\nran I think, but now I really do. I\u2019m\nnot phased by much.\nIC Radio: So you expected the\nvitriol and the abuse directed at\nyou, maybe partly because you are\na woman as this male dominated\nuniversity? And if so,did it still hurt,\ndid it still affect you even though\nyou knew it was coming?\nL: Yeah.That\u2019s a hard one because\nit did hurt even though I knew\nit was coming, so I don\u2019t think\nanything can prepare you. You can\nbe warned about anything but then\nuntil it happens, you\u2019ll say \u201cOh\ngosh, this has actually happened to\nme, people weren\u2019t lying or trying to\npsych me out.\u201dYeah, it did hurt, but\nlike I said, I had the most incredible\nsupport and they said, \u201cdon\u2019t even\nthink about it, forget it, you\u2019re the\none who has put yourself forward,\nyou\u2019re the one that wants to do this,\nyou\u2019re the one who wants to change\nstudent experience and that sort\nof thing, so go for it, don\u2019t think\nabout it.\u201d Actually I had a lot of my\nfriends who stopped it as well. If\nthey heard anything, they\u2019d say \u201cno,\nthat isn\u2019t the case\u201d, and I had a huge\ncontingent of male campaigners, so\nthat counteracted it really, because I\nthought, actually, people might just\nbe saying this because they want to\nvent about something or other.\nIC Radio:\nThis is one of my favourite tweets,\npossibly of all time.\n\u201cThe Scots who voted yes shouldn\u2019t\nbe allowed into England. You don\u2019t\nlike us, well news flash, we really\ndon\u2019t like you either #Treason\u201d. Do\nyou still stand by that statement?\u201d\nL: Partly. I think I wrote that\nwhen I was very angry because I\u2019m,\nas you can probably tell, extremely\npatriotic. I love Great Britain; I love\nGreat Britain as England, Wales,\nScotland and Northern Ireland.\nAnything to do with Britain I will\nlove. I think it was more a case that\nI felt like: \u201cWhy would you vote to\nleave the body that is together, that\nis supporting each other?\u201d I just\ncan\u2019t get my head around that. I\nstill can\u2019t. I think that was a little bit\nharsh, it was very in-the-spur of the\nmoment. I knew this would come\nup at some point! I remember one\nof my friends saying \u201cYou should\ndelete that\u201d and I said \u201cNo, I\u2019m\ngoing to stick by this\u201d.\nSo no, I stick by it. Obviously I\u2019ve\ngot a lot of Scottish friends, but\nthankfully all of them voted to stay\nwithin the Union. I just felt it was\n\u201cEngland, Scotland, who supports\nwho? Who does this, who does\nthat?\u201dI want it to be a unity.Anyone\nsaying \u2018no\u2019, I feel that\u2019s a bit of a two\nfingers up to everyone else. I think\nthat upset me at a deeper level. I\nknow that\u2019s very controversial, I\ndon\u2019t think anyone knows about\nthat tweet actually.\nIC Radio: But is it treason\nthough?\nL: Hmm, this is my traditional\nside coming out. I don\u2019t know, I\nthink treason is a very strong word,\nbut, in a sense, if you\u2019re voting to\ndisband the entire of Great Britain\nessentially.\nIC Radio: You mentioned you\nhave to represent the views of the\nstudents, but at the same time you\nhave to be apolitical, because you\nhave to represent all of them, and\nthere\u2019s a massive mix of student\nviews.\nAgain, I\u2019ll start with Twitter:\n\u201cTube drivers! You are not entitled\nto massive salaries. Get over it!\u201d via\nthe Telegraph.\nAre junior doctors allowed\nmassive salaries? Do their salaries\nqualify as massive given their job?\nDo you support Jeremy Hunt in his\nbid to cut them?\nL: I definitely do not support\nJeremy Hunt, at all. I don\u2019t know\nwho would! I\u2019m sorry if you do!\nIn relation to the tube drivers and\nthe junior doctors, the amount of\nqualifications junior doctors have to\ngo through, the work that they have\nto put in, everything that they have\nto go through to become a doctor.\nObviously that\u2019s the school, further\neducation, higher education, the\nmoney you have to spend, especially\nnow with \u00a39000 fees. Everything\nthat goes into becoming a doctor,\nyou have to live, breath, eat, and\nspeak medicine, everything!\nWith tube drivers, no they are not\nentitled to massive salaries! Their\nsalaries already are huge, for the fact\nthey press a button, and they drive\na train. I think every job [salary]\nshould be in relation to how much\neffort, how much training has been\nput into it. I know a lot of people\nwill be like: \u201cWhat,as if tube drivers\ncan\u2019t become doctors?\u201d, that sort of\nthing. I completely appreciate and\nrespect that, but there are a lot of\npeople in this university who have\ncome from extremely disadvantaged\nbackgrounds, who have worked\nextremely hard and are on their way\nto becoming a doctor.\nSo in respect to training, hours\nand effort, doctors should get paid\nmore.\nIC Radio: Do you support\nthat move by the current Tory\ngovernment to remove maintenance\ngrants?\nL: Not at all. I think the problem\nis that, yes you might be getting the\nsame amount of money technically,\nor more, but the student debt thing\ncomes into account, and actually it\nwill put off a lot of people coming to\nUniversity, if they think that they\u2019ll\nbe in even more debt and I already\ncan\u2019t afford to come to university.\nIt\u2019ll put so many people off, and\nfrom disadvantaged backgrounds as\nwell, and they\u2019re the people who we\nneed. Especially in STEM subjects.\nI think that at Imperial, being the\nonly specialist STEM institution\nin the country, it\u2019s already difficult\nto get people in who haven\u2019t come\nfrom independent schools, because\nindependent schools have all the\nequipment necessary to teach\nscience at a high level. The problem\nis that if we\u2019re just going to take away\nthe money we can give to students\nwithout them having to pay it back,\npeople are going to be so daunted by\nthe prospect of coming to university,\nespecially London. That\u2019s the issue.\nPeople will think, \u201cOh, I\u2019m going\nto come out with loads of debt that\nI\u2019ll have to pay off.\u201d People will\nend up doing apprenticeships, and\nthey\u2019re good as well if you want to\ndo that, but obviously coming from\na University point of view,I feel that\neveryone, if they want to, should be\nable to come to University. I think\nthat would be such a shame if that\nwas not an option for people.\nThe lads from \u2018Listen Whilst You\nWork\u2019 interviewed our President .\nYou can lissten to Arran and Hasan\non IC Radio every Tuesday from 8\nto 9pm\nI love Great\nBritain; I love\nGreat Britain\nas England,\nWales,\nScotland\nand Northern\nIreland\nFELIX\u2019s invite to the presidential handshake must\u2019ve got lost in the post.

Photo Credit: DesignPLX/Isaac Cordal\nO\nn Monday, 25,000\nofficial delegates\nfrom 150 countries\ndescended on Paris\nfor the COP21 Climate Talks.\nOf all the talks we have seen to\ndate, they are the best organised\ninternational talks, with the most\npotential. The biggest progress is\nthat they are focussed around the\nclimate action targets that countries\nhave agreed meet by 2020, called\nIntended Nationally Determined\nContributions or INDCs. They\nare also set to acknowledge at least\nsome of the great potential of local\nand grassroots action on climate\nchange by emphasising the role\nof individual cities, like London,\nin setting their own targets and\nactions.\nIt would be a lie,however,to herald\nthem as a solution,even a temporary\none, to our climate change woes.\nThe INDCs mentioned will allow\nfor more coherent discussion and\nwill hopefully push countries to be\nmore ambitious, but taken as they\nare, they still steer us on a course for\nat least 3\u00b0C of warming.This means\ncatastrophic sea level rise of at\nleast half a metre by 2100, massive\nweather disasters, floods, droughts,\nand mass homelessness. This will\nlargely affect those in the global\nsouth who haven\u2019t contributed to\nclimate change in the first place.\nLook a little closer and it\u2019s clear\nthat even this is optimistic. Huge\nbusiness groups like Business\nEurope have taken the stance that\nclimate action is directly opposed to\neconomic growth and governments\nare nodding along with them.\nIt would\nbe a lie\nto herald\nthem as a\nsolution,\neven a\ntemporary\none\nWe need\na massive\ninternational\npeople\u2019s\nmovement\nAdd your\nvoice and\nyour hand\nReluctant to set real regulation,\nand scared that they\u2019ll lose out on\nindustry, they have promised huge\ntax funded pay-outs to companies,\nshould they set any.Business Europe\nare right: economic growth and true\nsustainability are fundamentally\nincompatible and until governments\ncan prioritise people before profits,\neconomic growth will always take\nprecedence and climate action will\nnot make headway.\nSo, do the talks in Paris have any\nrelevance to the climate struggle?\nThey do, because they bring climate\nchange into the global media\nspotlight, providing a stage for the\nreal issues to be aired among the\nlies and lobbying. Globally, climate\nmarches of well over half a million\nover the weekend highlighted the\nreal strength of this. These people\nprovide hope for real action beyond\nthe Paris talks, outside of the\nisolated world of politicians and\ncorporations.\nMany marchers in Britain\nemphasised the link between\nclimate apathy and active hostility,\non the part of our government, and\ntheir vicious and selective austerity.\nCuts to solar subsidies have cost\n2000 jobs and the prospect of viable\nsolar energy on the grid for many\nyears to come, and the scrapping of\na home insulation scheme for new\nhouses is a huge blow to sustainable\nliving as heating will remain our\nbiggest domestic fuel use by far.\nIt has been estimated that a\nnational home insulation scheme\nwould create 100 thousand jobs.\nMeanwhile we are the only G7\ncountry to increase fossil fuel\nsubsidies \u2013 a move condemned by\nthe UN.\nWhat can we do? The thing about\nclimate change is that it is acutely\ntime sensitive. As long as we emit\ngreenhouse gases they keep piling\nup in the atmosphere and will\nguarantee some degree of climate\ncooking even if we halt all emissions\nimmediately. We need a massive\ninternational people\u2019s movement\nthat doesn\u2019t rely on our economic\nand political system to change\nthings, and we need it now. In fact,\nwe need to change them. But, time\nis short and we must take every\nopportunity to force the powers\nthat be to listen now, whether that\nbe rallying in huge numbers in every\ncountry on the 12th\nof December\nto mark the end of the climate\ntalks, taking part in mass civil\ndisobedience through the climate\ngames, or playing a part in any of\ncountless climate change actions\norganised by ordinary people like us\nin the months following the talks.\nSo don\u2019t be disheartened by the\nfailure, on the surface, of the Paris\ntalks to deliver a safe future, instead\nadd your voice and your hand to the\ngrowing number demanding action\non climate change for our own sake\nand that of our fellow humans.\n\n"

The very definition of\niconic,it essentially defines an entire\ngenre. but, at almost three hours it\u2019s\nhardly a welcoming introduction for\nnew fans. Perhaps the following will\nprove an easier ride:\nThe Magnificent Seven\n(1960)\nA re-working of Kurosawa\u2019s Seven\nSamurai, The Magnificent Seven tells\nthe tale of a gang of heroes coming\ntogether to protect a poor village\nfrom thugs. Here, however, the\nbandits are met by gunslingers rather\nthan R\u014dnin. Characters are key in\nthis film and the flawlessly cast set\nof heroes does not disappoint, with\nSteve McQueen, Yul Brynner, and\nCharles Bronson all giving stand\nout performances.\nSerenity (2005)\nHow boring would the Western\ngenre be if it was refined to\ngrizzled middle-aged men in 1800s\nAmerica? The idea of a \u2018space\nwestern\u2019makes perfect sense in light\nof this film. Serenity picks up where\nthe infamously-cancelled television\nshow Firefly left off. Malcolm\nReynolds and his renegade crew\nreturn for one last adventure as they\nevade the might of a military regime\nand men gone mad at the edge of\nspace.\nUnforgiven (1992)\nTold you I couldn\u2019t ignore\nEastwood.Here,he presents a gritty\nand realistic take on an established\nformula that gives us equal measures\nof character development and\nthrills. Morgan Freeman and Gene\nHackman join Eastwood on this\ntale of revenge, as antihero William\nMunney takes on one last job. The\nending scene features some of the\nmost quotable lines and blood-pumping action ever put to film.\nBEN COLLIER\nBlack Mass\nDir: Scott Cooper. Script: Mark\nMallouk, Jez Butterworth.\nStarring: Johnny Depp, Benedict\nCumberbatch,Dakota Johnson,Joel\nEdgerton. 122 minutes.\nT\nhere\u2019s an episode of\nDavid Mitchell\u2019s brilliant\nYouTube series Soapbox\nin which he talks about\nthe problem with gangster movies:\none great film about gangsters gets\nmade in the seventies,he argues,and\nsuddenly everyone thinks they can\nmake three hour long dirges filled\nwith smoky wood-finished rooms,\nhilariously thick swear-riddled\naccents, and overly masculine\ngeriatric men droning on and on\nabout who\u2019s next to get whacked.\nHe blames The Godfather. It feels\nalmost unfair to compare any film\nto The Godfather, except perhaps The\nGodfather Part II, but watching the\nBoston-set crime drama Black Mass,\nit\u2019s easy to see what he was on about.\nBased on \u2018true events\u2019, Black\nMass recounts the story of Whitey\nBulger (Johnny Depp), South\nBoston\u2019s most notorious (and that\u2019s\nsaying quite a lot) mobster, and\nhis rise to kingpin status with the\ncollaboration of FBI agent John\nConnolly (Joel Edgerton). But\nwhile the story itself may be true, so\nmany similar things have been done\nso many times before \u2013 fictional or\notherwise \u2013 that the subject matter\nbegins to feel stale within minutes\nof the multiple-perspective frame\nnarration\u2019s rambling beginnings.\nThe brooding Mafioso sinking into\nthe cesspool of his own evil, the\ncorrupt police force, the endless\nstring of murders \u2013 certainly almost\nall of this has been done before, and\ndone much better.\nThankfully Black Mass manages\nto set itself apart from the pack\nsomewhat with a few flash touches\nof its own. The functional but by-the-numbers script is made up\nfor by the subtly excellent editing:\nduring most conversations, cuts\nbetween shots of the faces of each\nperson involved come thick and\nfast. With the stone-cold faces but\nfrantically searching eyes of the\nperformers, these quick cuts create\na powerful sense of the constant\nanxiety and paranoia that comes\nwith living on the edges of the\nlaw, and the thought that capture\nis always hiding right behind the\nnearest bush.\nThe relationship between Bulger\nand Connolly gives the movie\na strong emotional pull; it\u2019s not\ncorruption or bribery that keeps\nthe agent from spilling the beans,\nbut a deep friendship forged on the\nstreets of Southy,and his willingness\nto fight for his blood brother even\nin the most desperate of times is\nsomething not many films like this\nhave touched upon as well as this\none does.\nWhat baffles me about gangster\nmovies is how they unfailingly draw\nexcellent performances from their\ncast. Black Mass is no exception:\nDepp\u2019s performance as Bulger has\nbeen rightfully hailed as a searing\nreturn to form, and he hasn\u2019t been\nthis commanding in a role since\nthe first Pirates of the Carribbean;\nJoel Edgerton as well is on fine\nform, flexing his acting muscles\nwith a wide range of fully believable\nemotions.

Starring:\nJonny Fitzsimons, Thomas Glover,\nBen Thamer. 106 minutes.\nA\nwarm-hearted, generous\nfilm, Unbranded charts\nthe journey of four\nyoungTexan men as they\ntravel from Mexico to Canada with\na pack of wild, \u2018adopted\u2019 mustangs.\nImmediately we are introduced\nto the high-stakes game they are\nplaying as, during the opening\nminutes, one is kicked hard in the\nshoulder, and another desperately\ntries to control his bucking bronco.\nDespite the vast vistas on display,\nduring a journey that takes in Idaho,\nUtah, Arizona, Montana, and\nWyoming, Unbranded manages to\n\u2013 like Tommy Lee Jones\u2019 excellent\n2014 anti-western The Homesman\n\u2013 make the classic American\nwilderness seem isolatedly bleak,\ndangerous, and utterly unforgiving.\nExploring an ideological battle\nI had no idea existed, Unbranded\nwas made to raise awareness about\nthe plight of the wild horse in\nthe USA: in the 1970s an act was\npassed allowing mustangs to graze\non public land, but this has led to\na ballooning of number, making\nit difficult for any other livestock,\nand indeed the horses themselves,\nto survive. The Bureau of Land\nManagement (BLM) is responsible\nfor keeping these numbers down\nby keeping horses in captivity,\nbut adoption rates have dropped\ndramatically, and now numerous\nhorses are kept in cages rather than\nroaming free. Activists campaign\nagainst the BML, accusing them of\nhorse-genocide with a fervour that\ncould only be found in the USA.\nIt is an interesting topic, one that\ncould probably be explored in a\ngreater amount of detail, although\nthe film gets us up to scratch. I am\nsceptical, however, about the effect\nthe film will have, since the issue\ndoesn\u2019t really translate to our small\nisle. Furthermore, I don\u2019t know how\nmuch it will encourage people in the\nUSA: training a mustang takes four\nmonths of hard work, and \u2013 as the\nfilm shows \u2013 human intervention\nis perhaps not what is best for the\nhorses. Two are struck lame by the\nend of the first state, and one dies\nbefore they reach the end.\nBut the emphasis of the film is\non the companionship of the four\nyoung men, and the dangers of their\ndifficult journey, and if we see the\nfilm as a document of that, rather\nthan a campaign flick,it works rather\nwell. There are elements that seem\nexcessively cheesy at times \u2013 some\narguments between the men seem\nto be engineered for the camera \u2013\nand some aspects make the entire\nthing seem like an advertisement\nfor Jim Bean bourbon. Despite this,\nhowever, the film\u2019s entertaining\npremise, earnest motivations, and\nrefusal to sugarcoat the dangers of\nnature, make it a very worthwhile\nwatch.\nFRED FYLES\nJohnny Depp as Jamie Bulger in the Boston crime drama Black Mass. Photo Credit: Allstar\nDocumentary corner: Jesus Camp\nBen Collier\nFilm Writer\nI\ns there anyone in here who\nbelieves that God can do\nanything?\u201d the energised\nPentecostal preacher Becky\nFischer questions her baying crowd\nasthecameracutstoamotherraising\nher two uninterested children\u2019s\nhands excitedly. The opening scene\nof Jesus Camp places the viewer\nright in the middle of one of the\nservices at a Christian children\u2019s\nsummer camp in North Dakota.\nAs the scene continues, fast editing\nand a haunting score crescendo\nto a pandemonium. Parents yell\nencouragement as the children and\nviewer alike are treated to the first of\nmany frenzied sermons which come\nto be the focus of this film.\nThis introductory five minutes\nalone set the tone perfectly. Telling\nthe story of this camp and its\nleaders, Jesus Camp attempts to\nmake broader statements about\nfundamentalism in America.\nA massively hands-off approach is\ntaken by directors Heidi Ewing and\nRachel Grady, with no voice-overs\nor opinions being directly offered\nby the pair. This approach works\nso well because the ridiculousness\nof this church and its inside goings\non are so obvious that comment\nis unnecessary. \u201cWe got too many\nChristian grown-ups who are\nfat and lazy,\u201d our morbidly obese\npreacher exclaims as the camera\nholds on her, and subtle critiques\nand digs like this are sprinkled\nthroughout the film. The actual\nopinions of the filmmakers seem\nto be reflected in a few small clips\nof radio host Mike Papantonio,\nwho talks of the influence of these\nreligious groups and their scary\nright-wing affiliations. Some would\ncall his sections slightly forced but I\ndisagree; the dialogue he eventually\nis able to have with Fischer in\nparticular serves as a perfect\nmicrocosm of political debates\noccurring within America.\nIt is this that allows the film to\ngo beyond the camp and explore\nthe wider issues of right wing\npolitics and literalist Christianity in\nAmerica.One scene that particularly\nstands out involves a cardboard cut\nof George W. Bush featured in one\nsermon, where Bush is deistically\npraised by the preachers for his pro-life ideals and commitment to God.\nThe dangers of religion in American\npolitics is explored in detail with\nthe nomination of Samuel Alito \u2013 a\nheavily conservative Christian, and\nfriend of Bush \u2013 to the Supreme\nCourt acting as a key example.\nA simple, objective glance into\nthis camp is really all the filmmakers\nneeded to provide to ensure a solid\ndocumentary. The reason why\nJesus Camp should be considered\namongst some of the modern greats\nis the wider comments it makes: the\nright wing political and religious\nundertones to the camp and the\nfilm give Jesus Camp an interesting\ndichotomy \u2013 one minute we see the\nchildren exploring caves and playing\nin the woods, while the next they\ncry,pretend to speak in tongues,and\nsmash cups labelled \u2018Government\u2019.\nWhat we are left with is the\nquestion of whether these children\nare being brainwashed, and how\nmuch of a threat these groups pose\nto American society. Ewing and\nGrady leave that up to you to decide.\n\u2018I pledge allegiance to the Christian flag\u2019. Photo Credit: Jesus Camp PR\nfurther than to say that even the\nbrave are afraid. That is not to say\nthat genuine sentimentality did not\nfeature; it did, but just not when\nthey were trying to force it upon\nyou. The addition of a some strange\nchoices in the story, not least the\nsmall drug-trip scene that featured\n(yes, you read that correctly), made\nfor, on the whole, a slightly jarring\nexperience.\nIt wasn\u2019t all mediocre though: the\nCGI landscape was more detailed\nand gorgeously rendered than any\nanimated film I have seen before\n(and I have seen a lot). With the\nentire film set in the open, there are\nplenty of immensely beautiful shots\nthat I could\u2019ve stared at for ages.The\nreason this is so important is because\nnature has an extremely large role to\nplay \u2013 the true antagonist of the film\nis not a dinosaur, but all of nature.\nThe daunting presence of the\nhighly realistic storm clouds and\ncrashing rivers contrasts with the\ncartoonish look of Arlo, making\nhim seem even weaker than he was\nbefore.\nWith enough humour, warm-heartedness, and spectacular\nscenery, The Good Dinosaur is still an\nenjoyable film,but unfortunately for\nPixar it is nothing more than that.\nALEX HEIB\nD\nespite an original spin\non the classic \u2018Boy &\nHis Beast\u2019 trope \u2013 in\nthis case, the dinosaur is\nthe boy, and the human the beast \u2013\nPixar\u2019s latest, The Good Dinosaur, felt\nrather childish. And yes, I know it\nis a children\u2019s film, but that doesn\u2019t\nmean it has to be childish. The\nfair amount of violence on screen,\nhowever, leads to a confusion as to\nwhom the film was truly aimed at.\nThe story follows a young, fearful\ndinosaur named Arlo (Raymond\nOchoa) who gets lost far away from\nhome, and must make his way back\non a perilous \u2013 if not somewhat\ndisjointed \u2013 journey. During this\ntrek home, he ends up befriending\na \u2018critter\u2019, who is actually a primitive\nhuman boy (Jack Bright).\nA thin plot with an underlying\nmessage that is neither original\nnor subtly put, on the whole the\nstory has little direction.

Once\nhe arrives at the house, however, it\nis clear that things definitely aren\u2019t\nright. His father has stubbornly\nbunkered down, and is exercising\nhis tyrannical dominion over Maria;\nhere is a man who, possibly in the\nearly stages of dementia,is frustrated\nat his reliance on others, and acts\nout in the only way he knows how\n\u2013 psychologically taking charge of\nthose around him.His cantankerous\nnature knows no bounds: in one\nscene he complains to Maria that\nshe has bought the straws \u2018with\nthe corrugated neck\u2019, while in the\nnext he is seen snipping off their\ntops with the precision of an army\nmajor.Their house needs to be set in\norder, but Daniel isn\u2019t up to the task.\nInstead the amount of clutter in the\nhouse slowly grows, infiltrating on\nthe edges of everyone\u2019s lives like a\nmalignancy.\nWhile Leonard\u2019s prickly nature\nmakes it difficult to warm to him,\nJohnson\u2019s effective performance\nbrings to us a sense of how helpless\nLeonard feels, having to get his\nwife and child to clean him up after\nusing the commode. However, the\nbeating heart of the film is with\nMaria, whose internal suffering is\nportrayed with extreme pathos by\nJones in a masterful performance.\nWith a coping mechanism that\ndoesn\u2019t extend past pottering around\nand making tea, Maria\u2019s internal\nturmoil is reflected in the dramatic\nCumbrian landscape, which plays a\nrole in this film similar to that of the\nNorfolk Broads in 45Years \u2013 another\ncarefully constructed film about\naging and intimacy. In a world that\nseems skewed against aging actors,\nit is extremely heartening to see\nthat films are being made that take\nan unflinching look at the nature of\naging, and the effects it can have on\nthe individual.\nThat the film was Johnson\u2019s last\nperformance (he died earlier this\nyear) adds a sense of poignancy, one\nthat is reinforced by the fact that\ndirector Tom Fisher has mined deep\nwithin the seams of his family life.\nThe plot of the film came from his\nown experiences with his aging,frail\nparents, and Radiator was shot in\nhis own parent\u2019s house in Cumbria,\nleft untouched since their deaths.\nWith shades of Andrew Haigh\u2019s 45\nYears and Michael Haneke\u2019s Amour,\nRadiator is a subtle work, held up\nby powerful performances from the\nminute cast.The impression it leaves\nmay be small, but it is certainly\nlasting.\nFRED FYLES\nThe Good\nDinosaur\nhas a thin\nplot with an\nunsubtle\nmessage\nThe film\nexplores the\nwider issues\nof right wing\nUS politics\n\n"

But, our union president\nchose to defend her contentious\ntweets, including one which some\nImperial students might find\noffensive.\nIn response to a question about\na tweet where she said \u201cScots who\nvoted \u2018Yes\u2019 shouldn\u2019t be allowed\ninto England,\u201d the union president\nsuggested that voting to \u201cdisband\nthe entire of Great Britain\u201d was\n\u201cessentially\u201d #treason.\nHashtags are often used in\njest, but by doubling down on a\nregrettable error of judgement our\npresident trivially dismisses the\nserious political desires of a subset\nof Scottish students.\nIn case you missed it, the union\npresident also spoke about her\nviews on national politics (this was\nnot included in the transcript of\nthe interview which you will find\nin this week\u2019s FELIX). When asked\nA complete\nlack of\nempathy\nabout her support for Margaret\nThatcher, \u201can inspirational lady\nwho transformed the face of\nBritish politics,\u201d in a tweet after\nher death, she stated that \u201cthere are\na lot of families who were affected\nnegatively by her, my family\u2019s wasn\u2019t\none of them so I think it\u2019s quite hard\nto relate to that.\u201d\nNotonlydoesthisshowacomplete\nlack of empathy, but it gives respect\nto a politician who tried to oppress\nstudent unions in the seventies with\nSometimes,\nI wish I had\ngone to UCL\nproposed changes to their funding\n(although they were eventually\ndropped).\nThe sentence \u201cI\u2019d vote for the\nConservatives, and I\u2019ll give a very\ngood reason why\u201d isn\u2019t normally\nfollowed by empathetic reasoning.\nThe union president explained her\nsupport for the party by saying:\n\u201cFor my family, if the Conservatives\nweren\u2019t in power, they\u2019d be severely,\nseverely screwed over\u2026 I feel like I\nowed it to them.\u201d To be fair to her,\nshe then went on to describe her\nopposition to both Jeremy Hunt\u2019s\njunior doctors contract and cuts to\nstudent bursaries.\nMaybe I\u2019m being harsh. Her\nviews on politics are obviously\ndisconnected to her role as union\npresident and the tweets in question\nwere made before she started in her\ncurrent position.

Based on the\n1959 film, Ben. the heir to the Hur\nestate, is accused of treason against\nthe emperor. He is taken slave only\nto be rescued to wreak his revenge.\nHaving not seen the film the\nparody was a little disjointed\nalthough you could still appreciate\nits subtle humour. That said, it was\nsomewhat over shadowed by the\nassaultative slapstick dominating\nevery scene. Not to mention an\nirrelevant foray into a lovesick cast\nmember\u2019s infatuation with the\nleading actress. Despite this, it was\nredeemed by occasional, hysterical\nbouts of cunning punning.\nWith the protagonist giving a\nsomewhat stilted introduction in\nthe reccurring pantoesque theme,\nbefore retreating backstage. After\na clattering and a hullabaloo of\ncostume change the play sprang into\naudience members given cue cards.\nThis all ended in a piraty climax.\nThe second half dithered as the\nrhythm and plot started to slide.We\naction, or rather trotted in on three\ncamels to a nativity scene featuring\nMary and the three kings revealing\nthe entire four membered cast!\nDespite each of the three auxillary\nactors often switching characters\nto help with plot development,\nI admired how each of them\nmaintained an identity with each\nof their characters. This created\nan undercurrent which helped\npropel the characters through the\nwhirlwind storyline. A perplexed\nold man, a dreamy young woman\nand a vexed Welshman.\nInitially. I was fairly disenchanted\nas the play completely failed to pass\nthe Bechdel test, as most of the\nfemales were pretty darn flakey!\nHowever, the homogeneity of these\ncharacters only served to create a\nnecessary structural lifeline to the\notherwise chaotic play.\nThe panto style continued with a\ndabble into audience participation,\nwhen the characters jumped out\nof character to throw the audience\ninto a sinking slave ship. Each part\nof the auditorium were given certain\nphrases to shout, with a few chosen\nmeandered nonsensically around a\nshifty sea captain and a leper colony,\nalthough it did provide an amusing\ndance routine.\nTo wrap up this play provides an\nunpretentious slapstick affair. It is a\nperfect panto preview for those who\njust can\u2019t wait for Christmas.\nLove and lust in Lulu\nF\nrank Wedekind\u2019s Lulu\nis a story of seduction\nand tragedy. Choosing\nadjectives to describe\nNicholas Wright\u2019s adaptation of this\ncontroversial nineteenth-century\nplay is challenging. It\u2019s humorous\nat first, Lulu (though she is known\nby a variety of names) works her\nway through several husbands in\nGerman high society and gains\nconsiderable notoriety. She enjoys\nher power, the attention she receives\nand the privilege of wealth.\nHowever, through the play\u2019s five\nacts, Lulu takes on a darker tone.\nFluid set changes between acts\nare accompanied by Alex Hall\u2019s\nhaunting score, and a new actress\nplaying Lulu. Each actress brings\nwith her continuity, but an evolving\npersonality. Leonie Benesch is\nthe intention. Lulu finishes on\na profoundly unsettling note \u2013 a\nnote that doesn\u2019t finish but fades\ninto infinity. Wedekind himself\nwas a man with a prodigious sex\nlife, frequenting prostitutes and\neventually contracting syphilis. He\nsends vivid messages about the\ndangers of narcissism, lust and sex.\nIn fact, it\u2019s so starkly portrayed in\nLulu that the programme includes\na double-page spread on sexual\ncompulsivity, including contact\ndetails for Victim Support and\nSexual Compulsives Anonymous.\nCompetent direction by Christian\nBurgess marries well with Johanna\nTown\u2019s eerie lighting and Erin\nWitton\u2019s effective soundscapes.\nThis is also one of the few plays I\u2019ve\nattended that also includes a video\ndesigner (Matthew Ferguson) that\nadds an especially dramatic turn to\none scene.\nIfyou\u2019reafter\u2018funforallthefamily\u2019,\ntry Elf: The Musical (Dominion\nTheatre). Lulu is hard-hitting and\nbordering on melodramatic. It is\nthought-provoking and leaves you\npondering the complexities of the\nhuman psyche.

Claudia\nJolly is slyly intelligent, while Ellen\nGibbon\u2019s is wracked by tragedy.\nFor me, Countess Geschwitz\n(played by Bessie Carter) was\nthe highlight of the show; her\nperformance is heart-breaking.\nWhile Rodrigo (Nicholas\nRichardson) adds a playful element,\nand Schigolch (Paul Gorostidi) is\nimpossible to take your eyes off with\nhis energetic (perhaps over-acted)\nperformance, Geschwitz suffers.\nShe is bullied, but remains loyal,\nand is one of the few characters who\npossesses a genuine love rather than\nlust.\nIt\u2019s a complex play that could be\ninterpreted in many different ways.\nSome may see it as horrendously\nmisogynistic, while others will\npraise the strength of Lulu\u2019s\nindividual personality. Generally,\nthe story is coherent, but I felt\nthat more foreshadowing of future\nevents and characters was in order.\nLulu lacks a quest \u2013 what does she\nactually want? What are any of the\ncharacters attempting to achieve?\nIt\u2019s unclear, and an out-of-the-blue\nclimax left me craving some sense of\nepilogue or resolution.\nThere isn\u2019t any, and perhaps that\u2019s\nLulu at The Silk Street Theatre.

Following\nan outing for beverages and much-needed food,we headed back to base\n(a luxurious scout hut) and were\ngiven personalised tour tasks; some\nwere passed with flying colours over\nthe course of the weekend (shout-out to Laura using an ASDA carrier\nbag as a handbag on both nights),\nand some monumentally failed. All\nwas settled at \u2018Tour Court\u2019,a solemn\njudicial process in which tour\noffenders were given an opportunity\nto redeem themselves before Her\nHonour Ran (tour secretary and\njustice for the evening).\nWith a new sense of purpose, we\nImmortals defeated despite strong effort\nPanukorn Taleongpong\nWriter\ngot to Oceana, where most of us\ndanced the night away in an evening\nmemorable for all, but some went\nback to the hut early \u2013 purely to\nbetter prepare for Saturday\u2019s match.\nThe next day, everyone was keen,\nraring to go in the unrelenting rain,\nVivien Hadlow\nComment Editor\nWomen\u2019s Rugby, like Mad Max, easily passes the Bechdel Test. Photo Credit: Women\u2019s Rugby\nOur Mad\nMax\nthemed\ncostume\ngame\nwas truly\nsomething\nto witness\nL\nast Sunday saw the\nImmortals\u2019 third game\nof the season, against the\nHertfordshire Hurricanes.\nWith both teams going into the\ngame with two games down, both\nwere hungry for their first win.\nThe Hurricanes, however, came out\ntriumphant with a score of 6-36.\nDespite tough conditions both\nteams came out ready to start. After\na few plays on offense, Bami Falana,\none of our starting running backs,\npicked up an injury and was taken\nout. We wish him a swift recovery.\nDue to strong winds,pass plays were\nscarce and our defense were tested\non their ability to stop run plays.\nThey were consistent throughout\nthe 1st\nquarter, although the\nHurricanes scored a touchdown due\nto an unsuccessful pick from Alex\nBrockhurst.In the absence of Falana,\nplayers were determined to lift up\nmorale, but a fumble on a pass play\nwas recovered by a Hertfordshire\ndefensive back, leading it towards\nthe end zone. After a miss kick and\nan unsuccessful conversion, the first\nquarter ended with a score of 0-13.\nThe 2nd\nquarter started out\nmiserably for the offensive team:\nfalse starts resulted in small\nyardage gained, while miss-tackles\nfrom resulted in the Hurricanes\ngetting back close to our end zone.\nHowever, this was made up in the\nfollowing play with the defensive\nteam recovering the ball after\na forced fumble. Minor errors\nwithin the next few offensive plays\ncaused significant repercussions\nresulting in a QB sack and a safety.\nAfter a successful touchdown and\nconversion, the Hurricanes ended\nthe second quarter with the score of\n0-22.\nThe 3rd\nquarter started out strong\nfor the offense with running backs\nEmanuel Olagbaju and Jonathan\nRobert Joseph plowing through the\ndefensive lines. However, because of\nfalse starts, the line of scrimmage\nwas forced to move backwards, and\nHertfordshire were able to score\nanother touchdown from a pass play\nagainst the defense; a successful\nconversion brought the score to\n0-29. The next offensive plays were\nabundant with Olagbaju\u2019s ungodly\nruns and trucks, but continuous\nfalse starts continued to render\nprogress slow.\nWomens\u2019 Rugby leave their mark on tour\nThe final quarter was filled with\nvarious fumbles and recoveries\nfrom both sides. One in particular,\nrecovered by Paulius Viskis, was\nvery close to Hurricane\u2019s end zone,\nand set up Papa Noach for a much-needed touchdown. Unfortunately,\nthe conversion was unsuccessful and\nthe score was 6-29, with the final\ntouchdown was the result of a lob\npass against the defense.\nThe Immortals have yet to turn\ntheir season around. However, with\nonly three games played, there is\nplenty of time to do it.\nThe Hurricanes will now host\nthe next game at Hertfordshire,\nwhere the Immortals look towards\nredeeming themselves and finally\nturn their season around.\nand you could barely keep the subs\noff the pitch. We played a strong\ngame, with tries from Becca 1,\nBecca 2, Lizzie, and Sam bringing\nus to a 17-32 victory against the\nSouthampton medics\u2019 team. (Freya\nalso brought us our first conversion\nof the year, woowoo!)\nOur costume game was truly\nsomething to witness as we went\nall-in for our Mad Max theme \u2013 the\npicture explains all really.\nOur joint social was slightly one\nsided (we would have loved to have\nmore new dancing buddies!), but\nnothing could detract from the pure\njoy that was Jesters. After another\nmagical evening, and left only\nslightly confused by the double-toilet cubicle, we made our way\nhome.\nProud of all we had achieved in\nthe day, we were happily surprised\nby how rich we all still were (why,\nLondon, why?).\nSunday was IKEA-breakfast day\n(meatballs have never looked so\ngood) and time for the sad trip back\nhome.\nRoll on the next tour!\nWhat are they talking about in there?

This masterpiece\nof a show created by\nJ.G. Quintel is an example of one\nA\nfew weeks ago, without\nmuch promotion or\nfanfare, comedian Aziz\nAnsari and producer\nAlan Yang dropped their new\nshow, \u2018Master of None\u2019; by way of\nNetflix. The series\u2019 rapidly growing\npopularity and critical acclaim is a\ntestament to the pervasiveness of\nthe platform. Centring on twenty-something \u2018Dev Shah\u2019 making\nhis way through the world; each\nepisode is dedicated to exploring\none aspect of modern life. In fact,\nperhaps the show\u2019s greatest strength\nis its ability to highlight the humour\nin the seemingly \u2018everyday\u2019. In\nthat regard, it manages to be a\n\u2018situational comedy\u2019 in the truest\nsense; where very little of the\nplot feels manufactured. Perhaps\ncounterintuitively, this manages to\nmake seemingly artificial moments\neven funnier.\nThrough this exploration, \u2018MoN\u2019\nalso tackles a variety of social\nepisodes maintain a high level of\nquality continuing on. All that, of\ncourse, doesn\u2019t mean the show isn\u2019t\nwithout its faults. There are a few\nunfunny jokes that tend to go on for\ntoo long, and Aziz\u2019s mugging can\noccasionally border on the annoying.\nSome characters, Eric Wareheim\u2019s\n\u2018Arnold\u2019 being a particular victim,\ncome across as one dimensional and\ncartoonish; seemingly serving no\nreal purpose. At times, the acting\nissues, from Feminism, to the\nrepresentation of minorities in\nmedia, to the supposed ennui and\nlack of direction of millennials.\nIn this viewer\u2019s opinion, the show\nhandles these with a deft touch.\nRather than serving the viewers\na ham-fisted metaphor sandwich,\nAnsari and Yang wisely opt to\nguide us to our own realisations.\nThis is further aided by the diverse\ncast and their diverse world views.\nThere are no real villains here; not\neven that guy masturbating on the\nsubway. Well, okay, maybe he is a\nlittle bit. This cast also highlights\none of the other great strengths\nof the show; relatability. There are\ncharacters and situations here that, I\ndare say, anyone could identify with.\nFor me, episode 2, \u2019Parents\u2019 was a\nparticular highlight. Here, at least\nto me, Ansari perfectly captures\nthe parent-child dynamic of an\nimmigrant family.\nAs has become something of\na norm for new shows, the first\nepisode is probably the weakest.\nThough that\u2019s not to say it\u2019s bad by\nany stretch.In general,the following\nCale Tilford\nMusic Editor\nof those few rare instances where\nTV can appeal to both children\nand adults. The series features the\nmain leads \u2018Mordecai\u2019, a blue jay,\nand \u2018Rigby\u2019, a raccoon, who are two\ntwenty-something park workers.\nHowever, instead of working, they\nalways prefer to slack off, play video\ngames, watch TV, drink coffee and\neat pizza and tacos.\nWhat makes the show unique\nand so great is the large and wild\ndirections the show takes with\nseemingly ordinary tasks. The most\nmundane situations and storylines\nyou can think of turn into very\ninteresting plots and subplots that\nkeep you interested, intrigued and\nsecond guessing as to how exactly\nthey will wrap up. For example one\ntime, Mordecai and Rigby go out to\nget a grilled cheese sandwich, end\nup being mistaken for astronauts\nthrough their lying and then get\nstuck in a chamber with a rampaging\nsphere of antimatter that threatens\nto destroy the entire planet.\nAs extraordinary as the plots\nmay be, the show draws a lot of\nits strength from having excellent,\nwell-written characters. When you\nmeet them, everyone seems fairly\ngeneric with their own traits and\nroles. As you progress through\nthe show though, you see all the\ncharacters get developed and shown\nsome love at some point or another.\nThere is literally no character that\nhasn\u2019t gotten their own time to shine\nto some extent; they\u2019re all really\nrelatable and have their own issues\nthat they have to go through. These\nissues parallel problems of our own,\nsuch as the struggles of maintaining\na long-distance relationship, trust\nissues, sibling rivalry, overcoming\ninsecurities etc.\nThe show brings a touch of\nnostalgia to the table, capturing\nthe essence of the older Cartoon\nNetwork shows with a great\natmosphere and a good and likable\ncast. It also has a modernised\nelement, making it feel up to pace\nwith more modern trends. Given\na lot of the stuff that gets past the\nradar, it feels more like an Adult\nSwim cartoon wearing the skin of\na Cartoon Network one. There are\nseveral times you may doubt this is\na show written for kids; for example\nthere is a scene where some of the\ncharacters go on an \u201cacid trip\u201d,\ncourtesy of a concoction of spicy\nfoods.\nAll in all, this is definitely a\nfantastic, heart-felt show that will\nconstantly subvert your expectations\nand make you wonder what kind of\ntricks and ideas the creative team\nwill come up with next. With its\nepisodes only being around 10\nminutes long, it is truly a simple and\nquick show worth checking out.\nThe Regular Show is now in its\nseventh season\nThe fun don\u2019t stop when you drink orange soda pop. Photo Credit: Amazon Studios\nBad guys don\u2019t look at explosions. Photo Credit: Amazon Studios\ncan also feel slightly wooden. The\nworst offenders for this are Dev\u2019s\nparents. Although this fast becomes\nself-explanatory and endearing once\nyou know that they are played by\nAnsari\u2019s real-life mother and father.\nIn fact, ironically enough, Dev\u2019s\nfather ends up being one of the best\ncharacters on the show.\nOverall, these minor critiques\ndon\u2019t really put much of a dent in\nthe experience, and I would highly\nrecommend that anyone and\neveryone watch it. At the risk of\nsounding pretentious, it\u2019s also an\nimportant show; for reasons that\nshow\u2019s fourth episode \u2018Indians on\nTV\u2019 illuminates far better than\nI could. \u2018Master of None\u2019 is that\nrare sitcom that manages to be\nrefreshing, insightful, and, most\nimportantly, damn funny.\nMaster of None is available now on\nNetflix\nW\nhat if? It\u2019s a\nquestion that\nintrigues, inspires\nand the foundation\nof many fictions. \u2018The Man in the\nHigh Castle\u2019 asks: what would the\nworld be like if Axis powers had\nwon World War II? It is not content\nwith simply offering an alternate\nhistory; the series goes further by\nhaving the character\u2019s in its fictional\nuniverse ask the same question in\nreverse.Their \u2018what if\u2019 is our reality.\nBased on Philip K. Dick\u2019s novel\nwhich contained a novel within a\nnovel, Frank Spotnitz\u2019s adaption\nreplaces this literary device with\na series of films within a serialised\ntelevision drama. An early glimpse\nreveals that these reels of film\nshow a world where the atom\nbombs were dropped on Japan, not\nWashington, and where the Allied\npowers were ultimately victorious.\nThe protagonist\u2019s search for these\nfilms to see a glimpse of what the\nworld could be and to deliver them\nto the mysterious \u2018Man in the High\nCastle.\u2019\nSet in 1962, we see what everyday\nlife is like under fascist rule,whether\nin the Pacific States of America\n(which the Japanese control) or the\nGreater Nazi Reich (taking up most\nof Eastern America). The world is\nbeautifullyrealisedfromtheJapanese\ninfused San Francisco, decorated\nin lanterns and kanji signs, to the\nNazi controlled New York City.\nSpotnitz uses famous landmarks to\nemphasise the occupation; one of\nthe most powerful images in the\nseries shows the screens of Times\nSquare covered in Nazi insignia.\nWe see supersonic passenger jets\nspeed through the sky at a time that\nfar predates the first flight of the\nConcorde; the Nazi\u2019s have brought\norder and superior technology to the\npeople of America. Yet as viewers\nwith an understanding of the reality\nof the Nazi\u2019s and Imperial Japan we\nknow that this order comes with a\nsacrifice: \u201cMy father told me what\nis was like before the war. He said\nevery man was free.\u201d Ultimately, the\nseries plays with our overwhelming\ndesire for freedom.\nThe series reminds us of the\nhorrific views held by the Nazi and\nJapanese regimes. In one horrific\nscene a high-ranking Japanese\nofficer commits seppuku. And the\nsubjugation of the Jewish race is\nexplored, suggesting that while on\nthe surface society might seem calm\nthere are still sinister forces at work.\nRather than showing the\nconquerors as completely evil and\nheartless, Spotnitz displays their\nmore human side. We see their\nweaknesses, their worries, and their\npain. Many of their actions are\nstill horrific and coldly calculated,\nbut regret is often present in the\naftermath. At no point does the\nseries suggest their actions were just\n(or that they are good people), but\nit\u2019s not so reductive as to suggest\nthat every Nazi or Japanese officer is\nevil incarnate, a refreshing contrast\nto the current political obsession\nwith good and evil.\n\u2018The Man in the High Castle\u2019\nfocuses on characters from both\nsides of America. The main\nprotagonists, and members of the\nresistance, Juliana Crane (Alexa\nDavalos) and Frank Frink (Rupert\nEvans) live in San Francisco; their\nperformances never falter and they\nfeel appropriate for the time period,\nbut I never felt fully engaged in their\nstruggle. Similarly, Joe Blake (Luke\nKleintank) from New York and a\ndouble agent for the Nazi\u2019s rarely\nearns the audience\u2019s sympathy.\nThe most compelling performance\nby far comes from Rufus Sewell\nwho plays John Smith, a high\nranking SS officer. He commands\nand dominates every scene,\nwhether at work or with his family.\nThere are suggestions that he has\nbeen traumatised by war, and a\nparticular regret for actions of the\nconcentration camps.\nSimilarly, Japanese trade minister\nplayed by Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is\nshown as gentle and thoughtful. In\nthe midst of a cold war between the\nJapanese and the Nazi\u2019s, he keeps a\ncool head and as a result is easily the\nmost likeable character.\nTogether, these two characters,\nboth on the side of the enemy, give\na counter narrative that is both\nrefreshing and progressive.\nWhile there are a few problems\nwith pacing in the second half,\nwhere the series slows to an\ninfuriating crawl, \u2018The Man in the\nHigh Castle\u2019has the ability to satisfy\nyour curiosity unlike any other show\nthis year. Over ten episodes it delves\ndeep into a convincing world - one\nthat leaves a lasting impact.\nThe Man in the High Castle is\navailable now on Amazon Prime\nMordecai and Rigby, the show\u2019s stars.

Photo Credit: FELIX\nJunior doctor strikes called off\nO\nn Monday, it was\nannounced that the\njunior doctor strikes that\nhad been planned for\nthis Wednesday and two other dates\nin December had been suspended,\ndue to a last-minute breakthrough\nin negotiations between the British\nMedical Association (BMA) and\nthe government over proposed\ncontract changes.\nMany were angered when Jeremy\nHunt, the controversial health\nsecretary who has spearheaded\nthe proposed changes, tweeted:\n\u201cVictory for common sense. Strike\nshouldn\u2019t have been called w/o\ntalking to govt first but great for 7\nday services\u201d, along with a link to\nthe Acas statement announcing the\nstrikes had been called off.\nThe talks have recently been\nreopened with the help of Acas\u2019\nnegotiation services, after breaking\ndown last year. Junior doctors voted\noverwhelmingly in favour of strike\naction on the 19th\nof November.\nThe first strike was planned for this\nWednesday, and would have seen\njunior doctors walk out in every\ndepartment except emergency care.\nTwo subsequent strikes would have\nbeen full junior doctor walk-outs.\nSpeaking to the Mail on Sunday\nafter the strike ballot result was\nannounced, Hunt accused pro-strike junior doctors of \u201cbullying\u201d\non social media, and compared the\nNHS on the weekends to flying in\na plane \u201cwithout a co-pilot\u201d. He\ncalled the BMA the \u201ctoughest union\nof the lot\u201d, alluding to the fact that\nGrace Rahman\nEditor-in-Chief\nThe government finally accepts junior doctors\u2019 suggestion to involve an independent\nnegotiating service\nYou are a terrible waste of money, goodbye\ncovered by well-maintained shrubs.\nThe sharp-tongued presenter\nmaintained that Kensington and\nChelsea were using the new statue\nas an excuse to \u201cnot to have to weed\nand plant\u201d in the small patch.\nShe said she\u2019d rather the money\nwere spent on less frivolous ventures,\nsuch as \u201cmy day care in years to\ncome\u201d.\nThe local resident\u2019s association\nhas been mulling over proposals\nfor the centrepiece, submitted by\nseveral notable sculptors. Charles\nHadcock, whose work has been\ndisplayed in and around Canary\nWharf, proposed a globe, while\nPeter Randall-Page, who has work\nin the permanent collection of the\nBritish Museum, has proposed a\nlizard-like statue.\nThe sculpture would be funded\nby next door\u2019s \u00a3600m new build,\nOne Kensington Place. The council\ninsists on large developments like\nthis donating money for public\nart, with local councillor, Daniel\nMoylan saying the funds are not\npublic money, and can only be used\nfor this purpose.\nRobinson remarked that she\nwould make a complaint against\nthe plans before the deadline for\nconsultation, which was today.\nWatch this space, literally.\na historical doctor\u2019s union resisted\nthe initial construction of the NHS.\nHe neglected to mention that this\nopposition lasted just two months\nand was back in 1948.

Photo Credit: Tate Modern\nB\neing new to London, I\nhave been trying to work\nmy way round as many\ngalleries and exhibitions\nas possible. Unfortunately, work has\nbeen getting in the way somewhat,\nso it was exciting to trundle off to\nthe Tate (via being a photo-taking\ntourist on the Millenium Bridge)\nto have a look at one of their\nlatest exhibitions \u2013 a collection of\nsculptures by Alexander Calder.\nAs soon as I walked into the\ngallery I knew I was onto a winner.\nThe first room had just three\nsimple hanging wire sculptures,\nbut I was mesmerised. Like a 3D\nsketch, Calder had deftly captured\nthe features of a woman in a piece\nentitled \u2018Medusa\u2019 in just a few\ntwists of wire, which cast wonderful\nshadows,and was equally interesting\nfrom a number of angles.\nIn the next, much larger, room,\nmore of these simple 3D sketches\nwere on display, this time mainly\ninspired by circus figures. Standing\npondering the simplicity of the\nworks I was struck by how they\nreminded me of drawings produced\nwhen you aren\u2019t allowed to take the\npencil off the page. Strongmen,\nacrobats,dancers and elephants were\nall vividly captures in his sculptures,\nsome of which were hanging from\nof a painted board backdrop with\nbigger, blocky hanging sculptures\nin front of them, where the shadow\nfrom the hanging aspect became\npart of the 2D background.\nAs you might have guessed from\nmy descriptions, the majority of\nthe rooms cast light on Calder\u2019s\nless known work, but the final two\nthe ceiling and gently twisting, and\nall carefully lit so that their shadows\nwere projected behind them.\nThe interplay between Calder\u2019s\n3D works and their 2D shadows\nwas fascinating,and something I am\nsure that both the Tate and Calder\nwere keen to emphasise. One room\nfocused on works which consisted\nrooms were full of his iconic organic\nmobiles \u2013 perfectly balanced\nhanging sculptures which gently\ntwisted and transformed themselves\nin the ambient breeze. Here again\nthe interplay between the sculptures\nand their shadows was mesmerising,\nespecially as they gently twisted and\nchanged. It was incredibly relaxing\njust to sit and watch. They ought to\nget some for Central Library.\nWhilst I very much enjoyed the\nexhibition, at \u00a318 a go (luckily not\nif you are reviewing for FELIX!)\nthis is certainly a gallery to persuade\nyour parents to take you to. The\nartworks are wonderful \u2013 but the\nprice seems extortionate.\nTime waits for no comic\nSam Wood\nWriter\nA\nstand up comedian\u2019s\nworst nightmare:\narriving late to your own\nshow. A stage managers\nworst nightmare: having to run\nthe show and entertain a room full\nof punters whilst waiting for the\nact to arrive. This is exactly what\nunfolds before us in the original\nmeta-comedy \u2018Waiting for Gaddot\u2019,\nrunning at the Invisible Dot.\nThe following 60 minutes is\nan erratic farce that unravels\nunashamedly in front of the\naudience. For the most part,\nthe experience is immersive and\nentertaining. The play intersperses\n\u2018live action\u2019 with flashback videos;\nthese are well made and contribute\nto the narrative, although disrupt\nthe flow a little too much and fail\nto keep the audience as captivated\nas they were in the first five minutes.\nOften making mockery out of\nand at times transparent. With\nthis said, they can be thoroughly\nredeemed as they transmit such\na positive spirit to the audience,\nmaking you want to support every\njoke they attempt, no matter how\nsilly or obtuse. The venue itself, the\nInvisible Dot, supports this vibe\nfittingly \u2013 its intimacy, informality\nand pub-like atmosphere contribute\njust as much to the experience as\nanything else.\nOverall, \u2018Waiting for Gaddot\u2019\nis original, unusual and amusing\nthroughout. Whilst some elements\nare slightly off and executed poorly,\nthe well spirited cast never fail to\nkeep the audience on edge and most\nimportantly, laughing.\nThe Invisible Dot Ltd. in King\u2019s Cross\nComedy most nights from \u00a37\nDoesn\u2019t he look like a funny, upbeat guy?

However, the gags\naren\u2019t anywhere near as original as\nthe shows format would initially\nsuggest and they are derivative and\nexpected most of the time.\nIt is apparent throughout that the\ncast are mainly stand-up comics, for\ntheir acting is often over-cooked\nPirelli is a poacher turned gamekeeper\nIndira Mallik\nArts Editor\nSerena Williams being awesome. Photo Credit: Annie Liebovitz for Pirelli\nF\nirst they came for Playboy,\nnow Pirelli; this is turning\nout to be quite a winter of\ndiscontent for the world\u2019s\nmeninists. Earlier this week, Pirelli,\nthe luxury tyre company that\nproduces one of the fashion and art\nworld\u2019s most exclusive calendars,\ncaused quite a stir when they\nannounced the 2016 editon would\nfeature women more known for\ntheir brains and their brawn than\ntheir bodies.\nIn Pirelli\u2019s 52 year history, their\ncalendars have almost exclusively\nfeatured scantily clad supermodels,\nKate Moss, Christy Turlington in\nthe 90s and Adriana Lima and Lara\nStone more recently.\nThe soft core pin-up images have\nbeen lent artistic credence by the\nphotographers who have worked on\nthe issues.The distinguished roll call\nincludes Helmut Newton and Steve\nMcCurry to name a few.\n2016 will be Annie Liebovitz\u2019s\nsecond edition with the company. It\nmarks an about turn in the calendar\u2019s\nusual subject matter.\nIt is accomplishment, not flesh on\nshow (for the most part). Instead of\nsupermodels, it\u2019s superwomen who\nare featured.Patti Smith,Yoko Ono,\nSerena Williams and Ava duVernay\nmake up a roster of women of\ndifferent ages, sizes and ethnicities\nwho are pictured in next year\u2019s\nedition. Most are fully clothed.\nThat this is publicity stunt\ndesigned to maximise on the current\nclimate of celebrity endorsed social\njustice there can be no doubt,\nhowever, does this signal a turning\npoint in the fashion industry\u2019s\nattitude towards women and how it\ndisplays their bodies?\nThe Pirelli calendar website\ncertainly proclaims it does.\nSomewhat grandiosely it declares\nthat the calendar has been \u2018a journey\nthrough the evolution of taste,\nsociety and the customs of the last\n60 years\u2019\nPerhaps. The Pirelli calendar\nis famous for never going on\nsale, it is instead sent out to an\nexclusive and secret list of 20,000\n\u2018VIPs\u2019: musicians, politicians and\nroyalty\u2019 according to a company\nspokesperson.\nThe shift towards showing\npowerful women, fully clothed\nand presented as peers and equals\nrather than women displayed as\nobjects of desire for the male gaze\nshows a shift in the clientele Pirelli\nis hoping to woo. Amongst the\nsecret list of powerful people, more\nare now likely to be women, women\nwho who would rather an image of\nFran Lebowitz hung on their walls\nfor a month than Gigi Hadid in a\nmoulded latex bodysuit (featured in\nlast year\u2019s calendar).\nSo what of the artistic merits of\nLeibovitz\u2019s offering? Ironically, it\nis the image of Serena Williams,\none of two women in the calendar\nnot fully clothed, that is the most\nvisually striking.\nThe living tennis legend is\npictured with her back to the\nviewer, muscles rippling. The pose\nbrings to mind classical statues of\nsporting heroes and demi-gods, of\nAmazonian warrior women. The\ndelineation of light and shade, the\nstrong profile of her face speaks of\npower, of legend. It is a beautiful\nimage but it is fearsome at the same\ntime, it commands respect. The\nbeauty in Leibovitz\u2019s images are not\nmanufactured male fantasies, but a\nvery specific beauty to each sitter.\nThe focus in Amy Schumer\u2019s\nportraitisonhersardonicexpression,\nnot on her body, though she is the\nothe rowman who appears (almost)\nin the nude - the joke being that she\nis the only one who didn\u2019t get the\nmemo. Patti Smith, insouciant in a\nwhite shirt and black trousers seems\nto be lit almost with a halo.\nAbove all, the portraits demand\nthat the women be seen as\nindividuals before they are seen as\nsubjects. It is tragic that so simple\na thing is seen as groundshaking,\nbut it is on the foundation of these\nsmall victories that cultural shifts\ntake place.\nGimmick or not, it is heartening\nthat Pirelli has changed at all. It will\nbe hard for them to go back to the\nstutus quo, a return to bums and\nboobs next year is guaranteed to be\nPR suicide.\nHere\u2019s hoping they have begun as\nthey mean to continue; it would be\ngreat to see more inclusion in the\nfuture; perhaps 2017 will feature\nLaverne Cox as Miss July or Ruth\nBader Ginsburg as Miss May. A girl\ncan dream!\nIn a\ndeparture\nfrom the\ncalendar\u2019s\npast, the\nfocus is on\nbrains and\nbrawn, not\non bodies\nThese\nportraits\ndemand\nthe women\nare seen as\npeers, not\nobjects of\ndesire\nOn the\nfoundations\nof these\nsmall\nvictories\ncultural\nshifts are\nbuilt\nThe calendar notorious for its nudes turns its focus to inspirational women in the 2016 edition\n\n"

Who\ncares if my grandmother wouldn\u2019t\nrecognise it? If it\u2019s tasty, it\u2019s a good\nrecipe and that\u2019s all that matters.\nIf we didn\u2019t have people who were\npushing boundaries, we wouldn\u2019t\ncome up with new combinations\nand recipes. It\u2019s the only way that\ncuisine can advance, and that\u2019s what\nI enjoy being part of.\nAt this point, I do have to say\nthat there are a few people in my\nfamily who won\u2019t necessarily agree\n\u2013 my father vs modern Greek\nsalad was a notable battle. Instead\nof a slab of briney feta atop some\ncoarsely cut onions, cucumber\nand beefsteak tomatos, liberally\nsoused with tart red wine vinegar,\nlemon, oregano and olives, we\nhad a very different interpretation\nat a restaurant in Athens. Finely\nshredded phyllo pastry enrobed a\nstick of feta, the whole ensemble\nthen fried till crunchy yet soft in\nthe middle. Alongside it were the\nrest of the ingredients, finely diced\n(not pureed) and left to marinade\n\u2013 but for just long enough to still\nretain each components\u2019 original\nflavours, so that you could dip one\nin the other and have the whole\nblossom of flavours at once. I loved\nit, but my father, who had expected\nsomething a bit more traditional\n(read: not enough cheese), was left\ndisappointed. Needless to say, we\ndidn\u2019t return.\nThat has never discouraged me\nfrom presenting traditional dishes\nto which I\u2019ve added my own ideas to\nmy family. In fact, I enjoy surprising\nmy entire family with the occasional\ndish that really is a change from the\nstaple recipes that I do use from\ntime to time. This is easier for me\nto do with gastronomies I have\nread, practiced and experienced. For\nexample, I\u2019m happy to improvise\nan Italian twist on things, and so\nwhen I make a Ragu Bolognese\n(spag bol to you heathens), I\u2019ll\nadd soy and Worcester sauces, a\ntouch of smoked paprika and some\nmushroom ketchup \u2013 all of which\nboost the meaty depth of the dish.\nNone of them notice the additions\nuntil I tell them at the very end, at\nwhich point they don\u2019t mind, and\nhave been converted. Now, that\u2019s\nnot quite the same as doing a tofu\njalfrezi or suchlike, but it\u2019s still\nchanging their way of thinking.\nReally, this clash of tradition vs\nreinterpretation only ever comes to\naffect my own cooking in certain\nareas \u2013 cuisines that I\u2019m not too\nwell versed in \u2013 where I feel that my\nattempts to create a dish inspired\nby them may completely misuse\nan ingredient or idea. This mainly\ncovers those outside of America/\nEurope, the Middle East and the\nSubcontinent. I\u2019ll have a stab at\nSouth American \u2013 but salmon\nfor ceviche is not the authentic\nkind of fish to use (though given\nthat every country appears to use\na different one, who knows?) and\nplod blindly into the Orient \u2013 with\ndishes faithfully born from family\nfavourites, such as Beggar\u2019s Noodles\nand Wonton Soup. I have no idea if\nI\u2019m using the ingredients correctly\nfor some of the things we do blithely\nget from the Chinese supermarkets,\nbut the end result tastes good and is\nfun along the way.\nI mean, don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 as\na family of scientists we naturally\nput a lot of research into the recipes\n(ok, maybe we\u2019re just obsessive), and\nhave come up with patiently refined\nresults that we happily offer up to\npeople, even if it is our version of\ntheir national dish. Why? Because\nit tastes good! At least, it suits our\npalates\u2026but that\u2019s a complete\narticle in itself. Is it traditional? I\nhonestly couldn\u2019t say.\nBut, tradition itself is important.\nAs people shy away from cooking,\na phenomenon that is fortunately\nslowing, and choose the convenient\nroute of ready made food \u2013 be it with\nready meals that present (for the\nmost part) bland, drab versions of\nonce exciting classics, the memories\nof traditional foods can too fade.\nAll to often, the little intricacies of\ndishes are left by the wayside,and so\nslowly people forget just how that\nparticular soup tasted, that pasta\nfelt or those spices blended. I guess\nthis culinary history, like so many\nlanguages, is too at risk of being\nforgotten. If there aren\u2019t people\nappreciating old recipes (and yes,\nadding their own twists to them as\nwell!), those techniques and flavours\nwill die out! So, at times, I\u2019ll pull\nup my dad\u2019s recipe database (I said\nwe were weird) and look up those\nrecipes that he\u2019s faithfully copied out\nfrom his grandmothers notes, and\nthat both he and my mother cooked\nfor me over many years, and I now\nget to teach to my girlfriend. And\nI remember exactly why, sometimes,\nyou don\u2019t need to change anything.\nThat said, I had some other family\nremind me that you can cook a\nsteak perfectly well in a pan, after I\nwrote my previous article on meat.\nAnd yes, they weren\u2019t wrong \u2013 it\u2019s\nquite an art of basting and flipping,\nand the end result does have more\nof a grey band \u2013 but you get a\ndelicious fond (that browning on\na pan from frying meat?) that can\nform the basis of an amazing pan\nsauce, something that my reverse\nsearing method \u2013 with its digital\nthermometers and, potentially, high\ntech water baths, does not. And to\nthem, I didn\u2019t have an answer. Was\ntradition being usurped by a more\nconvenient method,where there was\na comparatively low skill barrier?\nHow could I say that I wasn\u2019t taking\nthe same convenient route as those\nwho buy ready meals, as all they\u2019re\nlooking for is a hassle free meal?\nAt the end of the day, I strongly\nbelieve food should be about taste\nfirst, and tradition second \u2013 but\nI know not everyone agrees with\nme, nor should they. And so whilst\nI won\u2019t be the first to serve up\nChristmas pudding with a hint of\nchilli to my gran, or serve my dad\nthat bloody Greek salad, I will\nhappily enjoy a nibble of chicken\ntikka if it comes my way.\nAre you interested in writing for the\nFood section?

In both senses of the word,\nexploring this freakish dichotomy,\nCarol is utterly, irresistibly, achingly\nravishing.\nBased on Patricia Highsmith\u2019s\nconvention-busting 1952 novel\nThe Price of Salt, Carol is at its\ncore a love story. Therese Belivet\n(Rooney Mara) is a young shopgirl who is unable to reciprocate\nher boyfriend\u2019s feelings for her, and\nhas a vague dream of becoming a\nphotographer. Carol Aird (Cate\nBlanchett) approaches, following\nsome meaningful eye-contact across\na crowded shop floor, to ask for\nhelp buying a Christmas present\nfor her daughter Rindy. Making her\nfirst move, Carol leaves her gloves\nbehind on the counter, relying on\nTherese to pick up on the flirtatious\nundertones in their conversations;\nreturning the gloves leads to a lunch,\nand then to home visits, and finally\na trip out west. It is this sojourn that\nallows Therese to distract herself\nfrom her boyfriend Richard (Jake\nLacy), Carol to forget about the\nimpending divorce from husband\nHarge (Kyle Chandler), and the\ntwo lovers to establish their physical\nrelationship. Moving around each\nother in a carefully choreographed\ndance of a love that must remain\nhidden, things eventually \u2013 as they\ninevitably must \u2013 come crashing\ndown: Carol returns to New\nYork to fight for custody of her\ndaughter, and Therese\u2019s anguish at\nthe abandonment takes on a brute\nphysical force, as she violently\nvomits up her emotions on a\nhighway returning east.\nWhat was radical about the novel\n\u2013 and, indeed, remains radical over\nhalf a century of progress later \u2013 is\nthe possibility of a happy ending\nthat opens up for the couple. It is\none that is not explicitly stated by\ndirector Todd Haynes, who deals\nin subtle clues rather than dramatic\noutbursts: the hand lingering just\na little too long on the shoulder;\nthe gaze that is caught and held;\nthe meaningful pause. Haynes is\nclearly in his element with Carol,\nwhich \u2013 after 2002\u2019s Far From\nHeaven \u2013 cements his place as a key\ninterpreter of 20th\ncentury America.\nHaynes\u2019 camera almost always\nviews Carol and Therese obliquely:\nthrough doorways, marking off the\nboundaries of private and public;\nwithin cars, ensconcing them in\ntheir own bubble of chrome and\nupholstery; through windows,\ntheir faces smudged into blurs by\ngreasy smears. Trapped within their\npassion, the pair place a buttress\nbetween themselves and the world,\nretreating into their own private\ndomain \u2013 a necessary technique for\ncoping with the social pressures of\nthe day, but also a perfect portrayal\nof the all-consuming passion love\ncan bring.\nThe dialogue is poignant, with\nevery pause and ellipse pregnant\nwith unfulfilled longing. Phyllis\nNagy\u2019s screenplay brings with it\na soft sense of a beat, offset by the\nvisual melody provided by Edward\nLachman\u2019s cinematography. Carter\nBurwell\u2019s score, all swelling strings\nand plucked harp, contributes to\nthis harmony, although on occasion\nit does outstay its welcome. Carol\nis simply stunning. Sandy Powell\u2019s\nsumptuous costume design alone\nconjuresuptheideaofamid-century\nManhattan, but Jesse Rosenthal\u2019s\npitch-perfect art direction takes\nthis to new heights. The audience\nis transported out of the cinema,\nand stand blinking, blinded by the\nmidwinter sun, and the possibilities\nof love it can bring.\nAs Therese, Mara is at a career-best; in her hands, we watch Therese\nmature within the course of several\nmonths,from a na\u00efve young girl,one\nwho agrees without knowing what\nshe wants,to a fully-fledged woman.\nHer sexual awakening creates a fire\nwithin Therese, one that burns off\nany soft corners,leaving behind hard\nedges; her warm dimples traded\nfor an angular jawline; hairbands\nexchanged for high heels.\nCate Blanchett delivers a career-defining performance as Carol Aird, beginning the long march to the Academy Awards. Photo Credit: Weinstein Company\nFred Fyles\nFilm Editor\nCarol is a\ndepiction\nof a love so\npowerful\nas to be\ncombustive\nSurrender to Carol\u2019s ravishing beauty\nCate Blanchett and Rooney Mara burn bright in Todd Haynes\u2019 most beautiful film yet\nBlanchett\u2019s Carol, although on\nthe surface more composed, is\nperhaps even more vulnerable than\nthe young Therese. Hidden beneath\nthe veneer of make-up and furs\nthat mark her as a possession of the\naffluent, Carol seems impenetrable:\nconfident in her wants and needs;\nresolute in her refusal to live against\nher own grain. And yet Blanchett\u2019s\nnuanced performance teases out the\ncomplexity of the character. Therese\nis not just a plaything, a passing\ninfatuation; at multiple points\nCarol lets her guard down, in a\nperformance that \u2013 despite the fact\nthat she is always ready to retreat \u2013\nis completely heart-breaking.\nFor Carol, \u2018would you?\u2019 becomes\na rallying cry, one that echoes\nthroughout the film: \u2018would you like\nto have lunch with me?\u2019, \u2018would you\nlike to come visit me this Sunday?\u2019,\n\u2018I was hoping you might want to\ncome live with me \u2013 but I guess you\nwon\u2019t. Would you?\u2019 Earlier on, in\nthe cinema, one of Therese\u2019s friends\ntracks the correlation between\nwhat the characters on screen are\nsaying and how they really feel;\nat points like these, where Carol\nbreaks down the barriers she\u2019s so\ncarefully constructed, there is a true\nintersection between desire and\naction.\nCarol is a visually stunning,\nemotionally arresting, powerhouse\nof a film. Shot through with a\nsense of tender melancholy that\n\u2013 despite the uplifting ending \u2013\nimbues it with an aching, almost\nnostalgia-like sentiment, Carol is a\ndepiction of a love so powerful as\nto be combustive. Charring all in its\nrelentless path, we are consumed in\nits beautiful fire. It is a lipstick mark\non the rim of a martini glass. It is\nthe old photograph that has become\ntoo painful to clutch on to. It is the\ngreatest love story in recent memory.\nIt is simply ravishing.\nCarol\nDir: Todd Haynes Script: Phyllis\nNagy Starring: Cate Blanchett,\nRooney Mara, Sarah Paulson, Kyle\nChandler. 118 minutes.\n\n"

This year\nthe bid for a mosque-shaped cake\nreached a whopping \u00a32200, and a\nteddy bear was bought by ISoc and\nMuslim Medics for two grand.\nThe gang also sold hoodies,\norganised a charity football\ntournament, and held a conference\non \u2018Overcoming Obstacles\u2019, inviting This was one expensive cake.

With an audio\nspeaker in the midst of our team,\ncampaign-appropriate songs were\nblasted out as well as the occasional\nImperial March theme.\nHigh profile figures such as Emma\nThompson, Charlotte Church and\nJeremy Corbyn, adressed the crowd.\nThe London march was the largest\nof roughly 2,500 demonstrations,\nwhich included hundreds of\nthousands of protesters,taking place\naround the world ahead of a crucial\nUN climate summit in Paris.\nOther UK cities that hosted\nmarches include Bristol and\nEdinburgh.\nIn Paris, hundreds of pairs of\nshoes were placed in the Place de la\nRepublique to replace the protesters\nwho could not march as a result\nof the event being cancelled amid\nsecurity concerns. A human chain\nwas also formed by hundreds of\nParisians linking arms along the\nroute of the cancelled march.\nThe 2015 United Nations Climate\nChange Conference, known as the\nConference of the Parties (COP21),\nwill be held in Paris from Monday\n30th\nNovember until Friday 11th\nDecember. 147 heads of state from\naround the world will converge\non the French capital to attempt\nto reach a consensus on climate\nchange.\nThe 21st\nsession of COP21 has\nseen over 190 nations gathering\nin Paris, with the aim of reducing\nthe emission of greenhouse gases\namidst dangerous rises in global\nPeter Munton\nWriter\nDonning lab coats, students protested ahead of COP21 in Paris\ntemperatures.\nOver the two weeks of the\nconference, the attending parties\nwill discuss a potential new global\nagreement on climate change.The\nlast time the world discussed the\npossibility of a climate change deal\nand came close to an agreement,\nwas in 2009 at the Copenhagen\nsummit. The campaigners who\nmarched hoped that there will be a\nsuccessful consensus from the talks\nin Paris, with a firm agreement to\nreduce the impact of human activity.\nWhatever the outcome, those that\nmarched sent a clear signal to our\nworld leaders: they want a cleaner,\nsafer, more just future for everyone.\nOver \u00a3750,000 was raised internationally\nspeakers from the UAE and US to\nspeak on the topic in SAF.\nCharity Week began in the\nyear 2000, as a combined effort\nbetween the University of London\nUnion\u2019s ISoc network. It\u2019s now an\ninternational campaign, with ISocs\nfrom the UK, the US, and Qatar,\nnow involved.\nOver \u00a3750,000 was raised this\nyear in the UK, which is an increase\nof 22 grand on last year\u2019s final\nfigure. \u00a3435,000 of this was raised\nby students at London universities.\nLast year, ISoc broke their own\nrecord by raising a mammoth\n\u00a383,401.70.\nNot a charity in its own right,\nCharity Week operates in\npartnership with Islamic Relief.\n\u201cThe members of the ISOC\nhave worked tremendously hard\nthroughout the summer and first\npart of the term to make Charity\nweek the success that it is,\u201d said\nJawaad Farooq, ISoc\u2019s President.\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud and humbled that\nwe have this opportunity to make\na positive difference in the world\nduring our time at university.\u201d\nThere will be a poll to determine\nhow the funds are spent. As well as\nfunding care for newborns in Gaza,\nstudents can nominate to aid Syrian\nRefugees with psychosocial support\nand education, as well as other\nprojects in Malawi, Pakistan, India,\nMyanmar and the UK.\nOver 40\nImperial\nstudents\njoined the\nstudent bloc\n\n"

It\u2019s hard looking\nsociety in the eye, but someone\u2019s got\nto do it. We know it\u2019s not science\nin the form many at Imperial are\nfamiliar with, but it\u2019s social science,\nand just as important.\nContrary to what many might\nhave thought, Kimposium[sic] was\nnot a celebration of the Kardashian\nphenomenon but a discussion of a\nrange of important social issues,\nthrough the prism of one of the\nworld\u2019s most recognizable families.\nThe Kardashian family has occupied\nthe public spotlight for almost a\ndecade now and since 2007, has\nspawned 5 reality TV spin-offs,\na clothing franchise, countless\nproducts, a modelling career and\na disturbing home made video,\namong other things.\nThe effect reality TV has had\non the life and success of the\nKardashians might be obvious, but\nthe interaction of the family with its\nsocial context is more complicated\nthan would appear at first glance.\nIntricate relationships of race\npolitics, body image, social media\ncuration, and brand management\nhave resulted in a show that\nprovides a fascinating glimpse of\ncontemporary society.\nKimposium aimed to shed light on\nexactly these intricate relationships\nthrough a healthy discussion, open\nto the public. Brunel invited a\nrange of speakers from all over the\ncountry and beyond, not limited to\nacademics, but also including artists,\nfashion and culture writers and\nbloggers.Talks took the audience on\na 10-hour journey through the realm\nof reality TV, its effect on image in\n21st\ncentury society, the broadcasting\nof trauma and transitions through\nthe prism of twitter, post-feminism,\nbody shape and size, and even\ngenetics.\nThere was a similarly a wide range\nof attendees, across all levels of\neducation and beyond, all of who\nseemed to thoroughly enjoy the\ndiscussion. Sophie O\u2019Connell, a\nlocal 6th\nform student encouraged\nby her sociology teacher to go,\nsaid she was very excited to attend\nthe Conference. \u201cWe wanted to\nsee \u2018Fatness, Thinness and Race\u2019,\nbecause now that she\u2019s having a baby\nshe\u2019s getting criticised for gaining\nweight, which obviously you do.\nThey\u2019ve changed social media and a\nlot of girls\u2019 perspective of how they\nshould look and how they should\nfeel, especially twitter, and have had\na massive impact on our generation\nas a whole\u201d.\nSimilarly positive was the\nexperience of Hannah Smart,\na photography student from\nNottingham Trent University,doing\nher dissertation on women in self-portraits. \u201cIt was really good, very\nin. During the fifth segment,\nKatherine Appleford and Cecilia\nCappel from Kingston University\ntalked about the progression of\nwestern beauty ideals and their\nshift of focus from size to shape.\nThe Kingston Academics looked at\nthe historical and cultural context\nof white vs. black beauty and the\neffect Kim Kardashian\u2019s idolization\nhas had across the white and black\npopulation,with more white women\nstriving to get that mega-butt\nand more black women seeing an\nincrease in eating disorders across\ntheir community, possibly as a result\nof trying to attain the unattainable\nKim K shape.\nThen Gemma Cobb from the\nUniversity of Essex took over and\ntalked about anorexia nervosa and\nthe almost eugenic mind frame\ninconspicuously prevalent in not\nonly the anorexic subculture (forced\nunderground due to regulations\nagainst the promotion of mental\nillness), but also society. She looked\nat the fixation of the community\nwith Kendal Jenner (half-sister\nof Kim Kardashian), with many\nmembers treating her as a \u2018thinspo\u2019\n(thinspirational, possessing a\nslim body to aspire to). She\npointed out the prevalent trend of\ncondemnation of the Kardashian\ngenes, as \u2018trashy\u2019 and the danger\nof them contaminating the \u2018lovely\u2019\nJenner gene pool that must be\nresponsible for everything \u2018pleasant\u2019\nabout Kendal, differentiating her\nfrom her sisters.\nAll hail the mighty Kim! Photo Credit: Eva Rinaldi\nHalf Kardashian half Jenner half-sister,\nKendal. Photo Credit: Disney | ABC\nTelevision Group\nCaitlyn unware of that impact of them\nJenner genes. Photo Credit: Duncan\nRawlinson\nThe session raised interesting\npoints about the intercontextuality\nof race and beauty and the complex\npolitics underlying the dynamic.\nKimposium ended on a strong\nnote with a plenary from Professor\nPaula-Irene Villa, who summed\nup the discussions and talked\nabout feminism, body image and\npornographic liberation.\nThe Kardashians, for better or for\nworse, are one of our time\u2019s \u2018hottest\u2019\ncultural products and are invaluable\nin understanding many current\nsocial issues and trends. Dismissing\nthem as unimportant would be\nshort-sighted and an inexcusable\nomission of this decade\u2019s cultural\nhistory and understanding.\nOf course I\u2019m not advocating\nconsumption of said product.\nThere are certainly thousands if not\nmillions of better things one could\ndo with their time,including staring\nat a freshly painted white wall, but\nas long as the consumption of the\n\u2018\u2019Kardashian Bun\u2019\u2019 is as widespread\nas it is today, the show remains a\ngoldmine for social scientists and\nprovides a window into modern\nsociety and some of its more subtle,\nunnerving aspects.\nSession\nfive:\nFatness,\nThinness\nand Race\ndifferent to anything I\u2019ve been to\nor seen at university. It\u2019s particularly\ninteresting how different it is and\ncontroversial from the outside\nperspective, maybe from people\nwho might think this is ridiculous\nor a waste of time. Then you come\nto something like this and realise\nthere\u2019s much more than the TV\nprogram or their brand, there\u2019s a lot\nmore depth.\u201d\nPersonal highlights of the\nconference included \u2018Session five:\nFatness,Thinness and Race\u2019possibly\ndue to the caffeine from the three\ncoffees I drunk had just kicked\n\n"

Japan\nhas been consistent, stating that its\nwhaling activities are vital for the\nprogress of science.

Finding and\nmeasuring them all is a painstaking\ntask carried out all over the world\nby scientists and technicians, with\nmany still remaining outside our\nunderstanding.\nSome of these patient folks are\nlocated about five hours inland\nfrom Sydney, Australia in the small,\nunassuming town of Parkes. With\nnot much else going on,it is host to a\n64 meter telescope called the Parkes\nObservatory. Radio wave data from\nTuesday, preying on the Southern\nOcean.The expedition is due to end\nMarch 2016.\nHowever, this is one expedition\nof many, planned under project\nNEWREP-A, scheduled to last\ntwelve years, until 2026/27. 4000\nminke whales will be slaughtered\nunder the program. The IUCN\nred list considers Antarctic minke\nwhale populations as \u2018data deficient\u2019\nmaking it impossible to access\necological status. Are populations\nthreatened? Near extinction? Least\nconcern? We don\u2019t know.\nThe level of endagerment would\nseverely affect the justification for\nwhaling. Hence we are faced with\na snag. More scientific research\nof the Antarctic minke whale\npopulations is needed, and killing\nmammals for scientific research is\npermitted. Japan argues that only\nlethal methods can be used for\nassessments of whale age-at-sexual\nmaturity valuations. However, is\nthis abuse of the loopholes in a law\nsupporting scientific research?\nSea Shepherds CEO, Captain\nAlex Cornelissen suggests that\nJapan\u2019s whale hunt should be\nregarded as a criminal act,breaching\ninternational law protecting the\nSouthern Ocean and warns that his\ncrew and will intervene if necessary,\nto prevent such crimes.\nWhether Japan\u2019s declarations\nare honest or not, there is a need\nfor more scientific research of the\nAntarctic\u2019s minke whale populations\nfor a thorough assessment of the\nspecies\u2019 ecological health. However,\ndiving in with plans to kill 4000\nminke whales presents a high\nelement of risk to a population with\nso many unknowns. It is especially\ndisturbing when such proposed\nresearch is being carried out by\na country heavily involved in the\nwhaling industry.\nboth the deep and the near recesses\nof the universe has been collected\nhere for over 50 years.\nIn 2007, scientists at the\nobservatory discovered never-before-seen highly energetic pulses\nof radio waves in their archival data\nfrom 2001, which they called \u2018fast\nradio bursts\u2019.Carried into our galaxy\nfrom billions of light years away,\nthese fast radio bursts only last for\na few thousandths of a second, but\nproduce as much energy as the sun\ndoes in a day.\nRadio waves range from low to\nhigh frequency and interact with\nfree electrons as they travel on their\ncosmic voyages. These interactions\nslow down low frequency radio\nwaves, which arrive later than high\nfrequency ones.This is known as the\ndispersion measure and allows us to\nmeasure cosmic distances.\nIn the space signals of fast\nradio bursts, there is a mysterious\nmathematical pattern in the\ndispersion measure, where the delay\nbetween the arrival of low and high\nfrequency radio waves is almost\nalways a multiple of 187.5. An\ninitial superficial explanation could\nbe that each recorded burst occurred\nat exactly the same distance from\nEarth, but that is unlikely.\nNo one has managed to\nproduce a theory for this bizarre\nphenomenon of equal distancing\nbetween the wavelengths. This\nlack of explanation has led some\nspace-minded citizens to argue for\nextra-terrestrial origins. However,\nscientists are quick to distance\nthemselves from these claims,\npointing out the small sample sizes\nas skewing the perception of pattern\nidentification, which may disappear\nin larger datasets.\nThough it has been estimated that\nabout 10,000 of these bursts reach\nthe earth every day, researchers\nhave only found them in their\nrecords 15 times, with only one\never having been observed live,\non May 14, 2014. Five of these\nevents were just discovered recently,\nincluding a previously unseen twin-burst. Results were published in\nthe Monthly Notices of the Royal\nAstronomical Society last week\nScientists on the investigation\nwere excitedly tweeting the\ndiscovery of the new events, which\nNo one has\nmanaged\nto produce\na theory for\nthis bizarre\neffect\nwas all the more relevant since\na paper was also just released in\nAstrophysical Journal Letters\nidentifying a potential source as the\ncosmic union of a black hole and\nneutron star.\nWhile their source is still\ndefinitively unknown, these fast\nradio bursts are an exciting new\nfield in astrophysical studies.\nResearchers at the University of\nBritish Columbia are building a\ntelescope to measure them, called\nCHIME (Canadian Hydrogen\nIntensity Mapping Experience).\nHoping to gather data from tens of\nthousands of these events, they plan\nto use the information to construct\na 3D map of matter in the universe.\nWith a cloud of mystery still\nsurrounding these fast radio bursts,\nwe will undoubtedly keep our eyes\nand telescopes scanning the sky to\nlook for more events, in the hopes\nof understandingthe origins of these\npuzzling ripples in our cosmic pond.\n\n"
