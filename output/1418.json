The idea was originally conceived last year by the then\nPresident Stephen Brown and Deputy\nPresident (Education & Welfare) Kirsty\nPatterson, the latter of which is currently the Honorary Secretary of the\nCity and Guilds College Union and is\nstill in favour of the split.\nA large proportion of other universities have separate positions for education and welfare in the sabbatical\nstructure, which some have used as an\nargument for having the new position.\nBy splitting the roles, it would seem,\nat least on paper, that the two roles\nwould better tend to the needs of the\nstudents.\nOne of the biggest criticism that has\ncome from the current education and\nwelfare structure is that there are many\nstudent demands that fail to be met, for\nexample improvement of the prsonal\ntutor system. This could be one reason\nwhy Imperial College has the lowest\nstudent satisfaction rating of all the\ntop 10 universities in the country, an\nissue that was raised in the RWB meeting this week. At the end of each academic term, students fill out the SOLE\nform where they rate their courses and\nlecturers. However it was pointed out\nthat students feel very little action is\nseen from these results.\nWhen asked for her comments, Hannah Theodorou, the Deputy President\n(Education & Welfare) points out that\n\u201csignificant changes do come about as\na result of surveys such as SOLE. However, we have traditionally, as a College\nand a Union, not been very good at\ncommunicating these to the students.\nThis is particularly time-consuming\nand as such has usually been sidelined\nbecause of other projects\u201d. She went on\nto add \u201cThe issue isn\u2019t necessarily that\nmy workload is far greater than anyone\nelse\u2019s; all the sabbaticals are worked\noff their feet. It\u2019s the fact that my role\nhas the widest scope for improving the\nstudent\u2019s education experience whilst\nat Imperial and year-on-year, it is the\nsabbatical role which fails to meet the\nmajority of their aims because it is so\nbroad\u201d.\nAnother key point that was raised by\nthe group is that Imperial is truly inde-pendent, as it is no longer affiliated to\nthe National Union of Students [NUS]\nor the University of London Union\n[ULU], and as a result the representation of our students on a national scale\nis more important now than ever.\nWith each of the arguments for splitting the position, there were also the\nreasons against the split. One main\nconcern that was raised was that the\ncreation of the new position would\nmean that money would be moved\nfrom other sources, with the biggest\nfear being that money would be taken\nfrom clubs and societies. This is not\nthe case, as the need for an additional\nsabbatical would have to be agreed by\nCollege Council, with the extra money\ncoming from the College directly. Another concern would be the overlap\nbetween the two positions and the\nhigh need for communication.\nTowards the end of the meeting it\nwas suggested that instead of splitting\nthis role the Faculty Union Presidents\ncould become full time sabbaticals,\nwhich would mean that they could potentially alleviate the workload of the\nDPEW. This was supported with the\narguments that currently the faculties\nare able to deal with education and\nwelfare matters relating to their facul-ty. However, this would mean the creation of two more sabbaticals instead of\njust the one.\nHowever, some students fear that by\ncreating a faculty sabbatical, it would\nmean that the there would be more\nsegregation of students form the central union, as is currently the case\nwith Faculty of Medicine. Hannah also\npointed out that a lot of her workload\nis currently not Faculty- specific.\nThe issue is being taken to the next\nUnion Council on the 15th December.\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nFour might become five by this time next year\nImperial College Healthcare has\nsnubbed the NHS drugs rationing\nbody, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE), by setting up its\nown \u2018in-house\u2019 version. The trust will\ndecide whether to prescribe drugs to\nits patients that have been deemed not\ncost effective by NICE or have not yet\nbeen approved.\nThis move by Imperial comes after\nthe recent controversy that many new\nand more effective cancer treatments\nhave been rejected by the NICE purely\non cost grounds. These drug treat-ments, however, have been proven to\nprolong cancer patients\u2019 lives and are\nalso freely provided on the Continent.\nAs these drugs are not available on the\nNHS, many cancer patients have therefore had to pay for them privately in\norder to access the new treatments. In\nsome cases this can cost up to \u00a35,000\nper month.\nThe situation is worsened by the\nNHS rule that states a patient cannot\nbe both a private and NHS patient at\nthe same time for the treatment of the\nsame condition. Thus patients who\nhad been topping up their NHS care\nby paying for the new cancer drugs\nprivately, have found themselves effectively banned from NHS treatment.\nThis of course has incurred very heavy\nfinancial costs for many cancer patients\npaying for all aspects of their care.\nThe government initially backed this\nrather hard- line stance on patients\nturning to private health care. Their\nreasoning being that they did not want\nto create a \u2018two-tier\u2019 healthcare system\nwhereby patients lying next to each\nother on a hospital ward would be getting different levels of treatment. However,afterafewhighprofilecourtcases,\nangry front-page headlines and intense\nlobbying from high profile doctors, including Imperial\u2019s own Professor Karol\nSikora, the government finally backed\ndown and loosened up the restrictions\non private \u2018top-up\u2019 treatment. In light\nof the new regulations, Imperial College Healthcare has decided to contradict NICE and prescribe the expensive\nnew drug treatments banned from the\nNHS, where appropriate, and absorb\nthe cost from its \u00a3800m budget.\nThe trust is made up of Hammersmith Hospital, Queen Charlotte\u2019s and\nChelsea, St Mary\u2019s, Charing Cross, the\nWestern Eye Hospital and Imperial\nCollege London following a merger last\nyear. It is now one of the largest trusts\nin the country with a budget at least\ntwice that of the average hospital and\nwas ranked the third safest hospital in\nEngland only a few weeks ago.\nNot only that, but Imperial College\nHealthcare now has its own new cross-faculty Drug Discovery Centre. Professor Steve Smith, chief executive and\nprincipal of the trust, recently ranked\n11th in the 50 most powerful people in\nthe NHS, said the trust has such a large\nresearch base that the drugs may have\nbeen developed by its own experts or\nthat the trust is involved in clinical trials and can enrol patients. Thus it is\nbest placed to decide what the most effective treatments for its patients are.\nImperial College Healthcare may\nhave shown that it is a force to be\nreckoned with by taking matters into\nits own hands. It will, however, be interesting to see whether its defiance\nin favour of patient care sets a trend\nfor the rest of the country\u2019s healthcare\nproviders.\nThe government has begun issuing\ncompulsory I.D. cards to non-EU students living in this country. Students\napplying for a visa will be forced to pay\nbetween \u00a3295 and \u00a3500 as part of the\nvisa application process and will be\ncharged a \u00a330 fee if they lose the card.\nCritics have accused the government\nof using foreign students (a group less\nable to resist than UK citizens) as guinea pigs for the controversial scheme.\nBetween 50,000 and 60,000 foreign\nstudents are expected to receive cards\nby March with the scheme extended to\nhome and EU students in 2010.\nForeign students will be required to\nrenew their visas in person, at a number\nof centres around the country; a centre\nin Croydon will serve London. Biometric data including fingerprints will be\ncollected at the centres but eye scans\nhave been dropped. Liberal Democrat\nhome affairs spokesman Chris Huhne\nsaid: \u201cForeign nationals, who cannot\nvote, are perfect guinea pigs for a government wanting to test a deeply unpopular and unworkable policy.\u201d\nOther charges levelled at the scheme\nare that it is ineffective and serves\nmerely to reduce the general public\u2019s\naversion to I.D. cards. Phil Booth, head\nof the national No2ID campaign group\nsaid, \u201cThe Home Office is trying to\nsalami slice the population to get this\nscheme going in any way they can\u201d. He\nadded \u201cThe volume of foreign nationals involved is minuscule so it won\u2019t do\nanything to tackle illegal immigration.\u201d\nThe Conservative Party similarly opposes the scheme. Shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve said, \u201cThe Government are kidding themselves if they\nthink ID cards for foreign nationals\nwill protect against illegal immigration\nor terrorism - since they don\u2019t apply to\nthose coming here for less than three\nmonths\u201d. Foreign students will have no\nchoice about the I.D. cards as they will\nbe refused the right to stay in the country if they reject the cards.\nThe government has ignored opposition to the scheme. Home Secretary\nJacqui Smith claimed in November that\npeople \u2018can\u2019t wait for ID cards\u2019 adding\nthat \u201cI regularly have people coming\nup to me and saying they don\u2019t want to\nwait that long [2012].\u201d The government\nbelieves that the identity card scheme\nwill reduce illegal immigration and\nmake it easier for employers to ensure\nthey don\u2019t employ illegal immigrants.\nJacqui Smith said that employers and\ncolleges want to be confident people\nare who they say they are and added\n\u201cWe all want to see our borders more\nsecure, and human trafficking, organised immigration crime, illegal working and benefit fraud tackled. ID cards\nfor foreign nationals, in locking people\nto one identity, will deliver in all these\nareas,\u201d\nSome support for the scheme exists\nwith Sir Andrew Green of Migrationwatch UK saying the cards should be\nsupported.\n\u201cWe welcome the introduction of\nID cards for foreign nationals as part\nof wider measures to tackle illegal immigration,\u201d but Director of civil rights\ngroup Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti said:\n\u201cThe public will yawn at yet another\nre-launch of this scheme and if the\ncard came with loyalty points, we still\nwouldn\u2019t buy it. Picking on foreigners\nfirst is divisive politics; as costly to our\nrace relations as our purses.\u201d\nThe cost of the scheme has come\nunder attack with current estimates\nputting the price at \u00a34.7 billion. Critics\nhave decried the unnecessary scheme\nas a waste at a time of economic crisis.\nLiberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said \u201cThis hugely expensive scheme will have no impact on\ncrime, terrorism, illegal immigration\nor illegal working as foreign nationals\nalready have passports with visas. This\nintrusion on British liberty is completely unnecessary.\u201d adding \u201cWhen\nthe rest of us are forced to carry ID\ncards, this scheme will prove to be a\nlaminated Poll Tax.\u201d\nThere has been significant student\nopposition at a number of universities around the country. Students in\nLiverpool protested with anti-I.D. card\ngroup \u201cSay no to ID cards\u201d and Manchester University students outside the\nHome Office building. ICU President\nJenny Morgan told felix that she\u2019s \u201cyet\nto see one good argument for the ID\ncards, whereas there are so many arguments against.\u201d\nShe then went on to say that \u201cperhaps we should remind the government of the Human Rights Act. The\ngovernment should be ashamed at using international students who could\nbe vulnerable due to the language barrier and possibly not knowing what the\nnorm is in Britain.\u201d\nIf you are a non-home or EU student\nand have received an I.D. card or are\nre-applying for your VISA soon, please\ncontact us at felix@imperial.ac.uk\nForeign students\nused as identity\ncard \u201cguinea pigs\u201d\nKadhim Shubber\nDeputy Editor\nThe home secretary presenting the controversial new I.D. card\nAllegations of terrorism\nlevelled at Zohair\nThe home secretary presenting the controversial new I.D. card\nGot any views, let us know by\nposting on the Live! website -live.cgcu.net/news/1874\nphotograph courtesy of Live!\nKadhim Shubber\nDeputy Editor\nZohair Abu-Shaban, the Palestinian\nstudent that was prevented from taking up his place at Imperial this year,\nis suspected by the Israeli government\nof links to terrorist activities, felix has\nlearned.\nIn response to enquiries about Zohair the Israeli Embassy in London\u2019s\nPublic Affairs Department sent an\nemail to the Union detailing the reason\nwhy he was prevented from crossing\ninto Israel.\nfelix has seen this email which says\nthat \u201che [Zohair] is wanted for questioning in Israel as he is suspected of\nbeing involved with terrorist activity\u201d.\nThe email does not specify any further\ndetails but it goes on to state that: \u201cIf\nhe tries to cross the Israeli border he\nwill be arrested immediately.\u201d\nBefore applying to Imperial College,\nZohair had a Fulbright Scholarship to\nstudy at the University of Conneticut.\nWhen he tried to leave for the U.S. earlier in 2008 he was detained for 2 hours\nand interrogated by Israeli security\npersonnel about possible affiliations\nwith Hamas, which Zohair strenuously\nrejected: \u201cI am independent from Hamas, I have no affliation to it, I have no\nrelation to its activities.\u201d His U.S. visa\nwas eventually cancelled on the basis\nof secret Israeli evidence. \u201cI cannot\nsee the evidence and so have no opportunity to contest it,\u201d wrote Zohair\nin response.\nfelix was unable to contact Zohair\npersonally about the latest develop-ments, however he has previously stated his \u201cabhorrence of violence\u201d. felix is\nunable to comment on the credibility\nof the accusations and will report any\nupdates on the situation as and when\nthey are received. It is as yet unknown\nwhether the accusations will have an\nimpact on his deferred place to study\nat Imperial.\nImperial students celebrate\nWorld Aids Day\nStudent\u2019s from this years SHAG team managed to get a image\nof a red ribbon onto the Queen\u2019s Tower earlier this week to raise\nawareness of World Aids Day.

I know\nthey promised to give\neveryone in America\na Dr. Pepper if you finished your album before the end of 2008, but why\ncouldn\u2019t you just laugh it off as a joke\nand go about your probably bizarre and\nperverse daily life. Why do you have to\ntake everything so seriously?\nThis is of course the news that Axl\nRose\u2019s lawyers are threatening to sue\nDr. Pepper over their perceived reluctance to honour their offer of a free Dr.\nPepper for everyone in America (ex-cept estranged Guns N\u2019 Roses members Slash and Buckethead) after the\nrelease of the long awaited Guns N\u2019\nRoses album \u2018Chinese Democracy\u2019 on\nthe 23rd of November. I don\u2019t think I\neven need to comment on the standard\nof the album, other than the great John\nCage who famously once said \u201cThere\nis no noise, only sound\u201d obviously\nhadn\u2019t experienced this oral massacre.\nBut that was to be expected. My main\nsource of despair at this whole fiasco\nis Rose\u2019s utterly humourless reaction\nto what was originally quite a funny PR\nstunt. I therefore feel that it is my duty\nas a big-shot musical pundit to add my\nvoice to the ever increasing rumble of\nbewilderment.\nWhen you first think about it, the absurdity of an 80s hair-metal icon taking\na much loved soft drinks brand to court\nhas a humorous twang to it. It is easy to\nimagine the courtroom testimony of a\nPeter Sinclair\nMusic Editor\njovial Kool Aid Man-esque corporate\nicon opposite a fuming Axl Rose. But\nafter a bit of a laugh at Rose\u2019s expense, I\nfeel a bit guilty - I can\u2019t help but find it a\nbit of a sad and desperate display from\na man long past the peak of his career,\nthough still clinging onto his impenetrable rock-star ego. \u201cHow dare they\nmock Axl Rose\u201d, he thinks (I am certain\nthat Axl Rose thinks of himself in the\nthird person), \u201cDr. Pepper will live to\nregret this.\u201d Despite my love of Dr. Pepper and my disapproval of Axl\u2019s actions\ntowards what is my second favourite\nsoft drink, I feel a bit of sympathy for\nRose, and also to the people who knew\nhim before he attained the disgraceful\nheights of fame which destroyed his\nsense of reality so totally in his heyday,\nbecause they have lost forever what I\u2019m\nsure was a perfectly reasonable person\ninto the vacuous netherworld of untouchable superstardom.\nOn a separate note, big fat props\ngo to the boys at MusicMetric.com\nfor the fabulous new listings page this\nweek. Hopefully it will be a weekly\nthing so no one ever has to spend their\nhard-earned dollars on a shitty copy\nof TimeOut. Their actual website, a\nkind of customisable music listings\nand searchings type of thing, is going\nto be fully operational in a few weeks\nso watch this space. In the mean time,\nthey\u2019ve got a competition to win a\ncouple of iPods in exchange for about\ntwo seconds of market research, so it\u2019s\nworth a look anyway. That\u2019s it, on with\nthe music section! Hope you like it.\nAxl Rose vs.\nTHE MAN\nIt was a night of blood, sweat and even\na few tears. After an hour and a half of\nscreaming his lungs out, Pink Eyes, lead\nsinger of the Canadian hardcore mob\nknown as \u2018Fucked Up\u2019, descends from\nthe stage and proceeds to hug each and\nevery person still standing in the room.\nIt is a surreal moment, where the 150\nanonymous strangers assembled in the\nvenue all know that they have just witnessed something extraordinary.\nRewind a couple of hours, and it is a\ncompletelydifferentscenealtogetherin\nCamden\u2019s Barfly. The night is an \u2018XFM\nX-posure Live\u2019 event, hosted by oracle of the hotly-tipped, John Kennedy.\nOn the bill, three very different bands,\nthough all on the heavier end of the\nmusical spectrum. It all kicks off with\nInvasion, a bass-less London trio\nconsisting of two girls and one geek.\nThey play a solid opening perform-ance, ploughing through their interesting hybrid of stoner-rock and thrash\nmetal, laced with soul vocals. Unfortunately for these hard-rocking amigos,\nthe growing crowd hasn\u2019t come here to\nlisten to a half-hour System of a Down\nmeets Aretha Franklin gimmick, and\njust claps politely as Invasion leave the\nstage.\nThank God - or Satan, in this case\n- for Rolo Tomassi then. Hailing from\nthe unholy land that is Sheffield, they\nset their local scene ablaze three years\nago and have been touring up and\ndown the country since. As they launch\ninto their first furious piece of mad-ness, it becomes clear Rolo Tomassi\nare a league above the other so-called\n\u2018screamo\u2019 bands. A more accurate description of their music is \u2018spazzcore\u2019.\nThey play very fast math-metal, all\nscreaming and kicking, topped off\nby insane Crystal Castles-style synth\nspewing all over the place, like vomit\nfrom a kitten\u2019s mouth. The fact that\nvocals are provided both by schizophrenic self-mutilating keyboard-play-er James Spence AND his lovely sister\nEva, who hops around stage like a 12\nyear old school girl on crack, makes the\nwhole ordeal even more charming. To\nbe honest, I didn\u2019t think such a pretty\nCamden Barfly gets\nFucked the Fuck up\ngirl could make noises like that outside\nof Coffee Break Ravi\u2019s bed. But somewhere between the soul-destroying\nmetal, spurious fragments of jazz and\npsychedelic noise segments, there are\nsome insightful moments of calm and\nmelody in their songs. It really is astonishing to see such a young band already\nmasters of their trade, playing with\nMove on! Nothing to see here as none\nof the remixes in this compilation of\nLadyhawke\u2019s \u2018My Delirium\u2019 add anything to an already merely passable\ntrack. The original has Ladyhawke\n(a.k.a. Pip Brown) singing about her\nsexual frustrations through some terribly indistinctive vocals. It\u2019s not particularly catchy, so much so that even\nthough it\u2019s only been half an hour since\nI last heard it, I\u2019m struggling to remember any hooks or melody. She is,\nhowever, a competent instrumentalist\nand the track has a good energy, which\nbizarrely is something that each of the\neight remixes presented here promptly\nsiphon away. The result is 40 minutes\nof grindingly generic house beats that\ncompletely scupper the opportunity of\nmaking this track in the least bit inter-Ladyhawke gets Remixed\nJorge Costa\nCompilation Review\nLadyhawke\nMy Delirium (Remixes)\nModular Recordings\nHHIII\nesting; play any of these in a club and\nyou\u2019ll most likely find people vacating the dance floor. Still curious? The\n\u2018Chateau Marmont Remix\u2019 was the\nonly one that made me open my media\nplayer out of curiosity, but even this\nfizzles away over its running time. For\ndiehard Ladyhawke completists only.\nGregory Power speed and precision, not forgetting\ngreat stage presence. Rolo Tomassi get\nthe first moshpits of the night going,\nas fans of the band pile on top of each\nother and kick people in the face. The\nolder members of the audience stand\nback and let the kids have their fun, as\nit all gets a little too loud, spastic and\njust plain crazy. Still, nobody is left untouched by the spectacle and all in all\nRolo Tomassi go down extremely well.\nHell, I even bought their album.\nStill though, everyone has come\nhere for one very simple reason, and\nthat is to witness the miracle that the\nNew York Times refers to as the \u201cBand\nWith an Unprintable Name\u201d. They\u2019re\ncalled Fucked Up, and that\u2019s just what\nthey are. Formed in Toronto in 2001,\nthe members are only known by their\nridiculously strange aliases, for example guitarist \u201810,000 Marbles\u2019 or bassist\n\u2018Slumpy\u2019 (a girl, if you hadn\u2019t guessed).\nThey are masters at spreading around\nmisinformation about the band online\nand in interviews. Influenced by first\nand second-wave hardcore bands like\nMinor Threat but also Pink Floyd\u2019s\nprog-rock, they are a rarity in today\u2019s\nmusical world. For years they refused\nto release a full CD, opting instead for\nthe 7\u201d vinyl format. Shunned by major labels because of their true punk\nethics, they received glowing reviews\nin punk fanzines for every one of the\n30 two-track records they released\nover the years. The art work and lyr-ics, full of symbols and imagery, have\nalways proudly displayed the band\u2019s\nanarchist beliefs, and their live shows\nquickly gained a reputation for being\nchaotic and ridiculously violent. After\nthe release of their first record \u2018Hidden\nWorld\u2019 in 2006, Fucked Up crept out\nof the hardcore punk underworld and\nrose to the surface to start gathering\nfans all over the world. After their first\nEuropean tour in 2007, they famously\nplayed a concert in the men\u2019s washroom of MTV Live, during which fans\npillaged and spray-painted the entire\nplace before getting kicked out. Finally,\non October 7 2008, Fucked Up released\ntheir second album The Chemistry Of\nCommon Life, this time receiving rave\nreviews from all over the music world,\neven featuring on the front cover of\nNME. This is down to the incorporation of more rock and, dare I say it, indie melodies and vocals into their mu-sic. But at their heart, they still remain\nas hardcore as can be in this day and\nage without sounding like a nostalgia\ntrip.\nSo you can imagine my anticipation\nas I await the arrival of Fucked Up on\nthe Barfly\u2019s stage. The excitement is\npalpable, as everyone in the sold-out\nvenue has most definitely been playing\nthe new LP endlessly in preparation for\ntonight. But instead of some big theatrical entrance, the band step on stage\nsmiling, beer in hand and proceed to\nset up their own instruments, doing\ntheir own soundcheck. No roadies for\nthese rockstars, evidently. Still, everyone seems to be holding their breath\nuntil the first note is played. Now a\nsix-piece consisting of three guitars\n(just for that extra wall of distortion),\nthey joke about with the audience until suddenly the lights dim. They then\nproceed to blow everyone\u2019s brains out\nwith the opening riff to \u2018Son The Father\u2019, the first track off their new record.\nAs soon as singer Pink Eyes, lets out his\nunmistakable gut-wrenching growl, all\nhell breaks loose. The front rows of the\npacked venue quickly turn into a giant\nmosh pit, complete with people div-Continued on following page...\n\u201cThough he was\nbleeding from\nthe cut in his\nforehead, he still\nspit his lyrics\nas if he was\nGenghis Khan on\ncrystal meth\u201d\n...From previous page\ning over each other, punching the air\nas if fighting off an invisible rapist, and\nrunning from one side of the room to\nthe other in hysteric fits of laughter. It\nmight sound a little strange, but the\nenergy and raw power exuded by this\nband is enough to make anyone go crazy and join in with the other wackjobs.\nThe crowd\u2019s immediate reaction is\ncertainly down to Fucked Up\u2019s abrasive and anthemic songs, but live this\nband are all about stage presence. And\nthough all the members are awesome\nmusicians and definitely entertaining,\nit really is all down to one man. Or\nshould I say one big, hairy grizzly bear.\nAnd that bear is Pink Eyes. He is a massive ball of fury and an absolute living\nlegend. There is no voice comparable\nto his in all of rock, and no one with\nsuch a tendency for self-destruction.\nHe throws himself around the stage,\nshoves the microphone into audience\nmembers\u2019 faces so they can scream\nout the lyrics (which they all know of\ncourse), and strangles himself with the\nmicrophone lead. Oh but it gets bet-ter. After tearing his shirt off during\nthe first song, he repeatedly moons the\naudience with his humongous, beastly\nbadonkadunk of an ass. Of course\nPink Eyes\u2019 posterior is greeted by massive cheers and claps from the crowd\nthroughout the night. But that\u2019s not all!\nAfter the third song, he smacks himself\nin the forehead with his microphone,\nand though he starts to bleed from the\ncut, he still spits his lyrics like Genghis\nKhan on crystal meth. Throughout the\nnext hour and a half, this hairy bastard repeatedly jumps down from the\nstage, pushes past the crowd, knocking\npeople over in the moshpit, as well as\npicking up the biggest guys he can find\nand spinning them round his shoulders\nbefore throwing them back onto their\nfriends. It is pure insanity, but everyone is LOVING it. He doesn\u2019t miss a\nlyric either, as he always keeps hold\nof the microphone and gets people to\nsing along with him. The crowd aren\u2019t\nso much watching Fucked Up playing\na gig, as taking part in a giant rock n\u2019\nroll orgy.\nFucked Up play through most of the\ntracks off their new album, including\nthe incredibly powerful \u2018Black Albino\nBones\u2019 and \u2018Twice Born\u2019, as well as\nsome of their hardcore classics. \u2018Baiting the Public\u2019 sees the moshers from\nthe front climbing on stage and slam-dancing wildly before diving back into\nthe crowd. There\u2019s even a midget singing along to every word.\nSo when Fucked Up reach the end of\ntheir set, they are showered in praise\nand adoration, and rightfully so. If anyone deserves the media attention and\ninterest of music lovers everywhere\nright now, it really is Fucked Up. As\nstupid and ridiculous as they (and\ntheir name) might sound, no one plays\nwith as much passion and genuine love\nfor their music and their fans as they\ndo. And if that wasn\u2019t enough, they\u2019re\nchanging the face of music by making\nsuch a loud and aggressive style of music as hardcore into something almost\nmainstream, certainlycatchy and musically ambitious. Kind of like the Beatles\ndid to rock then? Fucked Up-mania is\nalready hitting the world. As Pink Eyes\npoints out himself in his hilarious in-between-song banter, he was recently\nvoted \u201cNumber 11 Coolest Person In\nThe World\u201d by NME.

    "content": "sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n32 Friday 5 December 2008\nfelix\nSport\n33\nfelix\nFriday 5 December 2008\nHi Colette, thank you very much\nfor meeting felix sports today!\nFirst things first - how has your\nseason been so far?\nThe season for the first team has not\nbeen too great so far because we have\nyet to win a game. But we are making\nprogress.\nProgress in which particular areas\nexactly?\nOur team is improving game upon\ngame! I am spanking them [the girls]\nregularly to make them play better! Seriously we are training hard though!\nHave you played the Medics yet\nthis season?\nWe actually played them [in ULU]\nlast night, and that wasn\u2019t a great game\nfor us at all, I am ashamed to say. I am\nnot really sure what the score was... 30\nsomething 5? [Final score was 28-8].\nWhen the 1sts do finally win their\nfirst game of the season we will all be\ndoing the felix page 3!\nBearing in mind that you are yet\nto win a game, how do you fancy\nyour chances against the Medics\nthis year in Varsity?\nWell Varsity is a very different game\nand just because we have not won yet,\nit doesn\u2019t mean we are not going to be\nany less prepared. I know the girls are\ngoing to try really hard [pause] and\nwin!\nI understand you are the club captain of the netball club, as well\nas being a prominent 1st team\nplayer. How do you think the rest\nof the club is doing?\nThe rest of the club is doing really\nwell this year. The 2nd team are undefeated apart from one game, but\nwe won\u2019t talk about that as we are not\nhappy. We are hoping that they will get\npromoted in both the BUCS and ULU\nleagues this year. I am very proud of the\n3rd team because it is their first year in\nBUCS this season and they have been\nwinning games even though they are\nin the same league as the 2nd team. So\nthey are doing really well. Both Anna\nand Alice are doing really a great job in\ntheir captaincy roles.\nSo moving on from netball to\nother sports - who is doing well?\nWho is not?\nWell I know the rugby 1st XV are\nstruggling like we are, they are yet to\nwin a game. I know that the volleyball\ngirls are doing amazingly in the BUCS\nPremiership even without their star\nplayers from the IDEA league last year\nin Zurich!\nHow do you think the Imperial sports teams can survive in\nhigher leagues once they have\ngain promotion.\nI think it is very hard for those teams,\nespecially us, that have been promoted\nwhen a lot of key players have gradu-ated. It was obvious last year that the\nleague we were in was too easy for us\nand we deserved to go up to a league\nthat would be more challenging. This\nyear we have lost players to injury and\nillness hence an inconsistent team. We\nalso have many postgraduates playing\nfor us that find it very hard to get the\ntime off to play. I think in general that\nthe high work load at Imperial means\nthat people find it hard to put as much\ntime as they want to into sports.\nHow is the netball club supported\nby both Sport Imperial and the\nunion?\nSport Imperial are very generous\nwith the amount of court time we get\nfor our BUCS fixtures. It is a shame we\ncannot fit training in there as well.\nWeek 3 in the build up to 25th February 2009. This week, Jack\nCornish interviews the Imperial Netball club captain and 1st team\nplayer Colette Gregory\nDo you think sport at Imperial\nsuffers because we are based so\ncentrally in London?\nTo be honest the netball club doesn\u2019t\nsuffer too badly because we can still\nfind courts centrally. Sometimes I wish\nwe had courts at Harlington with all\nthe other sports as we are bit left out\nbecause of it. I am sure after years of\ntravelling to Harlington you would\nwish you were in Ethos!\nAfter the recent football shenani-gans, what is your view on the\nmatter?\nWell, no-one is more of a fan than\ngoing out with your sports team than\nme. On a Wednesday night teams\nshould be out but they have taken it\ntoo far. I think unfortunately it is just\na few people giving the whole club and\nthe university a bad reputation.\nOne of the most important things\nfor the sportsmen/women is\nthe social side. How is it in the\nnetball club?\nUmm, this year I have calmed down\na little on the social side, being a mature final year and all! Although I do\nstill maintain my record of not missing\na Wednesday night. I have not been\nto Opal as much for the Daiquiris, or\ndowned as many pints of wine! The\nnetball club as a whole loves ACC\nBar Nights and we have several extra\nevents organised by our social sec including pub golf and tour.\nDo you think the union should\nfocus on participation in sports or\nexcellence?\nThey need to strike a balance.\nIs it being struck?\nThe netball club strives to allow all\nranges of abilities to participate. You\ncould be in the competitive 1st team or\njust turn up to training and come for\nthe social side and not play any games\nat all.\nMoving on to a more light hearted subject, if you weren\u2019t playing\nnetball what would you be doing\nin your spare time?\nBoys!\nI was thinking more along the\nlines of other sports?!\nOh, whoops! I think I would make\nan excellent synchronised swimmer or\nmaybe shot-put!\nCan you explain the nickname\n\u2018Spanky-Pants\u2019?\nIt is becoming a bit of a mini tradi-Not only a pro-netballer she also takes her drinking\npretty seriously. Pints of wine, cocktails and a sneeky\nsnakey-b would just be a starter in the world of Ms.\nGregory. Her prominence in the Netball Club has\nallowed the club to grow from strength to strength and\nbig ideas for the club are in the pipeline. Her continued\ninvolvement in Union life has made her a trademark on\nthe court and in the bars.\nFACT FILE\nName: Colette \u2018SpankyPants\u2019 Emily Gregory\nTeam: IC 1st Netball\nPosition: GA/GS\nDate of Birth: 14/09/1987\nHometown: Quethiock\nCourse: 3rd Year Physics\nHeight: 5ft 10ins\nWeight: 54 kg\nAsk the captain -Colette Gregory\ntion for the netball club to have\nan Anne Summers party each\nyear. Last year after several glasses\nof Rose wine I decided to purchase\na rather interesting\nset of lingerie! It always gets an interesting response when I\ntake my clothes off!\nTell me a joke.\nI could tell a geeky physics\none but...OK. Why are quantum\nphysicists so bad in bed?\nWhy?\nEither they\u2019ve found the\nmomentum but they can\u2019t get\nthe position or they\u2019ve got the\nposition but they can\u2019t find the\nmomentum!\nAnd finally, the standard question: what is\norienteering?\nI know what orienteering is!\nWe did this in Zurich [at the\nIDEAleague lastyear].Itiserm...\nyou get given a map with posts\nthat you have to try and find. I\nalso know that you shouldn\u2019t wear\nballet pumps while doing it otherwise you get really bad blisters!\nWho would you say is your\nsporting idol?\nNeil Jenkins, utter legend. My\nDad used to take me to Cardiff Arms Park to watch him\nplay. I have a grog of him and\neverything.\nWho do you honestly think\nwill win the Varsity rugby\nmatch in February 2009?\nIC all the way! They have been\nworking so hard and they deserve\nit. Of course it will be close but it\u2019s de-ffo our time now.\nHow did the netball vs. rugby\ncharity match go this year?\nUnfortunately, the match wasn\u2019t as\nsuccessful as last year for various rea-sons. However there is going to be an\neven bigger and better event next term\nto make up for it. I\u2019m thinking a tournament followed by a social. We can\nget all the sports clubs to join in and\nenter a team so that as much money as\npossible is raised for charity.\nHow would you say the netball\nclub has changed and/or improved\nsince your time at IC?\nThe netball club has become a lot\nmore prominent on the social side of\nthings and we\u2019ve got amazing pink\nhoodies now.\nIn the unfortunate even of\nyou not winning a match\nthis year, will you still honour the netball pledge to\ngrace the centrefold of felix?\nIf enough people want it then I might\nbe persuaded...\nIt is very hard\nespecially ... when\na lot of key players\nhave graduated.\nWe ran off the cold pitch last Wednesday in our muddy, well-worn boots\nwith rosy cheeks and an amazing\nfeeling of satisfaction having brought\nhome yet another victory. We retained\nour position at the top of the league\nwith a 100% win rate from our first five\nmatches of the season. We started off\nthe year with our experienced players,\nand have gained some fantastic new\nfreshers who have settled in well.\nWe first trekked it to Brighton but\nthe match was well worth the travel as\nwe played some fine lacrosse against a\ncompetitive team to win 11-8.\nNext on the line was a home match\nat Harlington against King\u2019s. This was\none of the most intense matches we\nLacrosse keep on winning\nElsa Butrous have ever played with some true fire\nand grit coming form both teams. After being down 3 goals at the \u00be inter-val, we powered up and managed to\nachieve 4 goals to win 7-6.\nPortsmouth joined us in Harlington\nfor our next match and with some great\nwork in attack, we secured another win\nand scored 18 goals against 3.\nWith a team of only 10, we travelled\nto Kent University in Canterbury feeling rather apprehensive about playing\n2 \u2018men\u2019 down. Playing on some rather\nlong grass meant our lacrosse was\nsomewhat sluggish at times but we still\ngot the ball in the back of the net and\nplayed some excellent defensive work\nto come away with a 21-1 victory.\nMost recently, we played King\u2019s in\nBerrylands. Having won by only one\ngoal in our first encounter with them,\neveryone was psyched for what was\ngoing to be another hard fought match\nas a loss would have jeopardised our\nposition at the top of the league.\nOur stick work training on Monday\npractises, looking out for each other as\na team and some fantastic consecutive\npassing paid off to produce some of the\nbest lacrosse yet. We were all smiles\nwhen the 60 minute whistle went off to\nfinish with an 8-2 win.\nWe have played some excellent lacrosse so far this season and working\nas a close-knit team has done wonders\nto our level of play.\nWe still have a few more matches to\ncome but we all ready and raring to go\nfor what will hopefully be our most\nsuccessful season ever.\nThe lacrosse ladies after another successful result in their quest to maintain a 100% record\nThis was the big one. The crunch\nmatch.Theonetheyhadtowin.Indeed,\nthe men\u2019s 1st team had up till now not\ncome up against much resistance from\ntheir opponents in the South-East di-vision. Four matches, four comfortable\nwins. King\u2019s, however, was a different\nstory : this was the only other unbeaten\nteam in the league. The winner of this\nmatch would have the title firmly in\nsight.\nWhen the King\u2019s delegation trooped\ninto the sports hall at 2pm, Imperial\nknew they were in for a tough fight:\nall of the opposing team\u2019s best fencers,\nsome in the British top 10, were present\nand rearing to go. However, backed by\na vociferous and plentiful home crowd\n(composed of most of the women\u2019s\nteam, the 2nd men\u2019s team, and an unidentified Scandinavian) our sabreurs\n(Maiyuran \u2018Myron\u2019 Ratneswaran, JeanRomain Cavaill\u00e8s and Seung-Wook\n\u2018Wookie\u2019 Lyeo) could step up to the\npiste with some confidence.\nIt was nail-biting stuff from the start,\nas Myron and Wookie both lost their\nbouts 5-4, showing that they were\nready to scrap for every last point.\nWith the score at 10-8 in favour of\nKing\u2019s, Jean-Romain came on and\ncompletely outclassed his opponent,\nwinning 7-1 and giving Imperial the\nlead.\nAnother four bouts saw King\u2019s claw\nback three points to make it 29-27; the\nnext bout put them in the lead 35-33\ndespite a valiant attempt by Wookie to\nstem the flow of hits. Heroic fencing by\nJean-Romain brought the deficit down\nto one point, and with the score at 39-40 (and absolutely everyone holding\ntheir breath) Myron stepped his game\nup another level.\nA sublime parry-riposte with one\nfoot off the back of the piste concluded\na resounding 6-2 win and meant that\nImperial had won the sabre 45-42! The\ncheers and applause that ensued even\nbrought a curious Neil Mosley, from\nSport Imperial, into the hall.\nIt was now the foilists\u2019 turn to show\nthat they were made of the same stuff as\ntheir sabre team-mates. The team (Ed\n\u2018Little Ed\u2019 Collier, Alex Morris, Chris\nNamih and Indy Leclercq) got off to a\nbad start, however, with two 5-2 losses\nfor Indy and Namih (who nevertheless\nput up a good fight against British no.6\nAhmed Rosowsky). Alex then lost the\nnext bout 5-1, and at 15-5 down, things\nwere looking a lot less rosy.\nThankfully, Namih then found some\nform and won his next match 6-2 in a\nvery convincing manner. Unfortunately, Indy confirmed his disappointing\nstart by throwing away the next bout\nwith some very poor fencing to leave\nthe score at 16-25.\nWins by little Ed (who was subbed\nin) and Namih reduced the margin to\n5 points, but Rosowsky left nothing to\nchance and finished off the match with\nclinical efficiency. Final score : 45-34 in\nfavour of King\u2019s.\nImperial were trailing by eight points,\nbut the match was far from over as it\nwas now time for our strongest weapon to come into play.\nThe ep\u00e9e team (Alessandro \u2018Ale\u2019\nCostamagna, Marcello \u2018I can\u2019t find my\nkeys\u2019 Colombino and captain Ed \u2018Big\nEd\u2019 Gilhead) knew that victory by the\nrequired margin was well within their\nmeans.\nHowever, the King\u2019s team did include\nMyron\u2019s older brother Kaj, who could\nhave caused some problems. The boys\nwere never worried, though, as all three\nwere all on sterling form and didn\u2019t lose\na single match. The score was 15-9 after the first three bouts, at which point\nthey never looked back.\n\u2018Il capitano\u2019 was on fire, producing a\n5-0 win, and Ale and Marcello looked\nuntouchable. The cheers got louder\nafter every point, and when Marcello\ngot the last hit, making it 45-20, scenes\nof unbridled joy unfolded in the sports\nhall. Final score: Imperial win 124\n\u2013 107.\nWe\u2019re now top of the league, and\nhaving a good, long, laugh.\nImperial out-fence King\u2019s to come tops\nFencing\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 127\nKing\u2019s College Men\u2019s 1st 107\nIndy Leclercq\nGo\u00fbter Route. It was a physically and\nemotionally exhausting effort, but after\na long, near continuous fourteen hour\npush from 2372m, the whole team enjoyed the incomparable satisfaction of\nreaching the summit. The day was only\nhalf done however and this had to be\nfollowed by the long, tiring descent.\nSome of the highlights of this time\nwere the Chere Couloir, with pitches\nof steep 80\u00b0 ice and the Frontier ridge\n(Kuffner Route) which led to the summit of Mont Maudit (4465m).\nCredit must go to Leon and James\nwho successfully led the voie normale\nto the summit of Mont Maudit. This\nwas their first alpine season, but it certainly didn\u2019t show.\nDuring the final week the fatigue\nwas showing. Spending a month doing\nlong routes at altitude had taken it out\nof us. More time was spent \u201crelaxing\u201d\nin the valley, either climbing on the\nsport crags of Chamonix, or running\non the trails on the valley sides. In the\nfinal few days Neil and Rob succeeded\nin climbing the classic Frendo spur up\nthe Aiguille du Midi. This involved\n1100 vertical metres of climbing.\nThe most sleepless night was spent\nhuddled in down jackets and an emergency blanket watching the shooting\nstars and avalanches. This was a fantastic finish to the tour, and I can\u2019t wait\nto get back out there next summer!\nIf you would like to join us for some\nmore adventures, come along to one of\nour meetings held on Tuesdays at 12:30\nin dB\u2019s bar in Beit Quad, or get in touch\nat outdoor@ic.ac.uk.\nContinued from back page\nWow!

Ha ha ha ha. Joking...\nNot! POW!\nNow I have your attention with my\nsweet ass moves I would like to make\nan important message. The real cause\nof my death was due to the excess intake of alcohol. Alcohol, while fun to\nconsume responsibly, can have detrimental effects on your body, especially\nwhen used long term. If you think you\nmay be an alcoholic, or consume more\nthan you should, go and see a doctor.\nThey will me more than happy to put\nyou right back on track.\nNow where was I? Oh yeah. Did you\nsee that movie I was in one time. I was\nawesome. I kicked so many people in the\nteeth it was bad ass. Some say I could\nwin in a fight against Jackie Chan and\nJet lee. I believe these people. I know\nI\u2019m a corpse and wot not, but zombies\nkick ass.

As\nwe learn at the beginning, Ari Folman\nsuppressed the memories from his soldier days for 20 years until a meeting\nwith an old friend jogs his subcon-scious. The friend\u2019s retelling of a recurring dream about the 26 dogs he killed\nduring the war prompts Ari to suffer\nhis first flashback and starts him on his\nquest to remembrance.\nThe Israeli-Lebanese conflict started in 1981 when violence erupted in\nSouth Lebanon and North Israel. South\nLebanon at the time was a state within\na state with a population of 300,000\nPalestinians and a very active Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO), which\nmade numerous, attacks on Israeli\nborder villages. Israel responded with\na bloody bombing of the PLO headquarters in Beirut and the fighting continued until July 1981 when a ceasefire\nwas agreed upon. But the seemingly\ncalm year was in reality filled with\nstrenuous tension. Ronald Reagan at\nthe time received a report in which his\nSecretary of State informed him that\nIsrael was ready to start a full-blown\nwar against Lebanon at the slightest\nprovocation. The provocation inevitably came and Israel attacked the civil\nwar ridden Lebanon in 1982. The resulting war is now mainly remembered\nfor the massacre performed by the\nChristian Phalangists in the Palestinian districts of Beirut. It is this massacre that our protagonist knows he witnessed but can\u2019t remember what part\nhe played in it. The movie is filmed as a\ndocumentary; Ari visits and interviews\nboth the friends that he believes served\nwith him as well as soldiers from other\nregiments and people involved in the\nwar who can shed some light about the\nevents that led to the massacre.\nAlthough the interviews at first seem\na bit random, they imitate the way in\nwhich the protagonist\u2019s memories\ncame back (i.e. in fits and starts, in disconnected snippets of images) and a\nclear picture of the war steadily builds\nitself as the movie continues. Obviously the theme of memory is very\nprominent in the film and at the start\nwe are rather explicitly told that memories should not be believed, the brain\neasily deceives our recollection of the\npast. This unsubtle reminder that what\nwe\u2019re watching and hearing isn\u2019t necessarily true is reinforced a hundred fold\nby the fact that Waltz with Bashir is\nanimated!\nThat\u2019s right, animated. And what a\npainstakingly beautiful animation it is.\nThe mise-en-scene is minimalistic; the\nartist draws in only those bits that are\nvital to our understanding of a shot,\nbut nothing else. Close-ups and yellow colours dominate, with the characters drawn in hard clear lines while\nthe background is slightly washed out.\nThis visual style creates a dreamlike\nfeel to the movie, which borders on being poetic.\nThe animation is what makes the\nfilm stand out and what allows the\nmovie to deliver such a powerful\npunch, because it forces the story to be\ntold without any acting. All the scenes\nare simply visualisations of the stories\ntold in a plain, monotonic, almost unemotional way, by the interviewees.\nThe result is a brutal clash between\nstunning and emotion-inducing im-ages, a very expressive soundtrack and\nthe cold narration of the atrocities of\nZuzanna Blaszczak\nFilm Editor\nwar. What we\u2019re seeing doesn\u2019t directly\ncorrespond to what we\u2019re hearing and\nthe feeling that this is unreal, all made-up, persists. And then bam! The movie\nreaches its end and suddenly the animated scenes of wailing women and\nabandoned corpses are replaced by\nIf you want to spend two hours stressing yourself out watching the lowest\nof the low scumbags presented to you\nin typical Hollywood fashion with no\nshades of grey, this movie is for you. If\nyou want a story with no clear resolution and one that leaves you despising\nhumankind that bit more, Clint Eastwood has fulfilled your wishes. Finally, if you want to see what is most\nlikely an Oscar winning performance,\nAngelina Jolie doesn\u2019t disappoint. But\nif you want a movie that is honest\nand unpretentious, one that will stay\nwith you after you\u2019ve left the darkened cinema room, don\u2019t put all your\nhopes into Changeling. You\u2019ll feel like\nshit coming out of the movie theatre,\neven the gloom of London\u2019s autumn is\nenough to dispel the only slightly lingering feeling of unsettlement.\nTelling a true story of one woman waging a war against the corrupt and brutal\nLos Angeles Police Department in 1928\nin order to find her missing son, Changeling is definitely not light entertainment.\nOn 10 March 1928 Walter Collins, the\nson of Christine Collins (Jolie), disappeared from his home. After a 5-month\nsearch the police announced that the boy\nhad been found and subsequently reunited mother and son. However, it turns\nout the LAPD has made a mistake, the\nboy is not Walter. But one of the most\ncorrupt police forces ever, one whom bad\npress is the last thing they need, cannot\nown up to making a mistake. They ignore\nChristine\u2019s allegations, bribing doctors\nand specialists to proclaim that it is possible for a growing boy to suddenly lose 3\ninches under stress and that the fact that\nthe new found boy is circumcised doesn\u2019t\nprove anything. Prompted by the local\nreverend (John Malkovich\u2019s forgettable\nrole), whose goal in life is to uncover the\nconstant breaching of the law by the po-lice, Mrs. Collins makes her fight more\npublic. And she suffers the consequenc-es. Interweaved between the story of\nthe morally putrid LAPD and Christine\nCollins\u2019 unwavering fight to find Walter\nis the mortifying tale of a young psychopath and the 20 or so kids he slaughtered\nwith an axe.\nChangeling HHHHK\nDirector: Clint Eastwood\nWriter: J. Michael Straczynski\nCast: Angelina Jolie,\nJohn Malkovich,\nJeffrey Donovan\nVisually breathtaking, Waltz with Bashir will leave you stunned.\nClint Eastwood impresses as a director yet again with this mystery melodrama that chills to the core\nDirected by Academy Award Winning\nSam Mendez (American Beauty), and\nstarring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate\nWinslet, Revolutionary Road looks set\nto be a show-stopping powerhouse of\nsuperb directing and acting.\nBased on a novel of the same name,\nRevolutionary Road is about a married couple, Frank and April Wheeler\n(Diaprio and Winslet) living in 1950\u2019s\nAmerica who want a better life for\nthemselves. April is an aspiring actress\nwho dreams of moving to Paris, and\nalcoholic Frank wants to quit his dead\nComing Out Soon\nend job and continue having an affair\nwith his mistress. Although a gloomy\npremise, the film centres on the couple\u2019s relationship falling apart and I am\nsure that both DiCaprio and Winslet\nwill provide stunning performances\nand will make the film commanding\nfrom beginning to end.\nThis is the first time Winslet and\nDiCaprio have worked together since\nTitanic, but the plot could not be more\ndifferent (thank goodness). With Winslet\u2019s husband, Mendez, behind the\ncamera, I hope that this film provides\nus with something like award winning\nAmerican Beauty than flop Road To\nPerdition.\nJonathan Dakin\nFilm Editor\nThis time Kate and Leo exchange selfless love for an unhappy marriage\nTo say the least, the movie is very dis-turbingandthesubduedwayinwhichthe\nstory is presented makes the punch even\nharder. Angelina Jolie\u2019s performance is\nparticularly effective because the actress\ndoesn\u2019t fall into the trap of expressively\nshowing every single emotion. When\nChristine is left with nothing but despair,\nJolie skilfully demonstrates despair rather than the, easier to act but more annoy-ing, hysteria. Despite a morally satisfying\nconclusion to the drama, Clint Eastwood\ndoesn\u2019t offer any comfort; gloomy scenes\nof a death sentence being carried out immediately follow scenes of a battle won\nin the courtroom. The movie is filmed\nnot in black and white, but in extremely\nbleak, washed out shades of green and\ngrey, interspersed with contrasting yellowish and brownish shots of the American outback where the grisly crimes take\nplace. Overall, however, the cinematography is boring and forgettable, used only as\na medium to seamlessly tell a story.\nThe director clearly put the script\nabove all else; the dramatic events that\nunfolded are shown without redundant\nflair, which is a very good idea that unfortunately backfires slightly. The musical score doesn\u2019t overpower the scenes\nbut it doesn\u2019t enhance them either. The\nrestraint of the main character in openly\nshowing strong emotions, adds to the undeniably depressing mood of the film but\nalso makes it that much harder to care\nabout the movie after the credits roll.\nEastwood took a chance by giving us a\nstory in this cool and slightly aloof manner \u2013 it partly works, partly doesn\u2019t, but it\nwasn\u2019t a mistake. What I can\u2019t accept on\nthe other hand is the one dimensionality\nof the police characters; even Christine\nCollins is to some extent flat. The bad\nguys are clearly bad and the good are nauseatingly good. I also wasn\u2019t impressed\nby the fact that everything in the film is\ngiven to us. We get it all nicely served on a\nsilver plate. The distinction between the\ngood and bad, the moral and unethical,\nis too sharp and too pronounced to get\nyou thinking. The most irritating thing\nabout Changeling though is how markedly it was created \u2018for your consideration\nonly\u2019; it\u2019s a film that knows it\u2019s meant for\nthe American Academy and the upcoming Oscars.\nThose are not tears of joy as Jolie realizes the kid found by the police juvenile departement isn\u2019t her son.\nZuzanna Blaszczak\nFilm Editor\nWaltz with Bashir HHHHH\nDirector: Ari Folman\nWriter: Ari Folman\nCast: Ari Folman,\nRon Ben-Yishai,\nRonny Dayag\nNew, innovative and moving, simply a must see!\nhistorical footage and we can no longer\ndelude ourselves that the war, the fighting and the massacre never happened.\nThat\u2019s when the screen goes dark, the\naudience continues to sit speechless\nand you realize this is the best movie\nto come out in a long time.\nFilms we love at Imperial\nHow can you beat Michael J. Fox skateboarding through town holding on\nto the back of a truck, to the sound\nof Huey Louis singing Power of Love,\nas the opening sequence to a movie?\nQuite frankly you can\u2019t, and hence my\nfavourite film has to be Back to the\nFuture.\nA mad scientist, a time machine and\nthe one and only MJ Fox are woven together by the likes of Robert Zemeckis\nand Steven Spielberg into a masterpiece of cinematic history.\nI\u2019m sure we all know the story, but\nfor anyone deprived during their early\nyears, here\u2019s a very brief overview, albeit one which simply cannot reveal\nthe brilliant intricacies of the plot. We\nbegin with the entrance of the fabulously good-looking Marty McFly (so\nhandsome, in fact, that he later lent his\nname to a boy band who certainly did\nnot live up to its legendary status). Following a phone call from his mad scientist friend, Doctor Emmett Brown\n(Doc, to his mates), Marty realises he\nis late for school, at which point the\naforementioned skateboard scene pro-ceeds. Where to go from here? Fear\nnot: Zemeckis has answers.\nMarty later meets Doc in a car park,\nwhere he reveals a beautifully sci-fi\nlooking car: a DeLorean. He then informs Marty he has transformed it into\na time machine. After sending his dog,\nEinstein, one minute into the future,\nDoc offers a brilliantly scientific explanation for this feat. I should probably\nconsult one of the many Imperial physicists before I ascribe its brilliance, but\noh well. It has something to do with a\nflux capacitor.\nUnfortunately,tocreatesaidtimemachine, Doc has stolen Plutonium from\nsome terrorists, who turn out to be\nquite unhappy about it and shoot him,\nleaving Marty to escape in the DeLorean. However, in the process, he accidentally travels back to 1955 and has\nno plutonium with him for the return\njourney. Only the energy of a lightening bolt can power the flux capacitor\nenough to send Marty \u2018back to the future\u2019, but of course he has to consult\nthe Doc of 1955 and consequently risk\nbreaking the space-time continuum,\nwhich he foolishly does on a number\nof occasions (will he never learn?).\nFor example, he meets his mother and\nstops her falling in love with his father,\nleaving his entire existence in jeopardy.\nClearly, this needs to be corrected, and\nalthough he only manages to do it just\nbefore he is due to travel back to 1985,\nit\u2019s nice to see he still has enough time\nfor a Johnny B. Goode guitar solo.\nOK, there might be a few holes in the\nstoryline and the continuous mention\nof flux capacitors and the space-time\ncontinuum may grate slightly, but who\ncares? Doc has a DeLorean that can\ntake you back in time: does anything\nelse matter?\nWith classic quotes including, \u201cAre\nyou telling me my mum has the hots\nfor me?\u201d and \u201cMy God Doc, you vapor-ised Einstein!\u201d brilliantly thought out\ninventions of the future and a classic\nsoundtrack, Back To the Future has\nsurely become a timeless classic. If you\nhaven\u2019t seen it, watch it; if you have,\nwatch it over and over again.\nCatherine Luckin\nStudent\nImperial College students, lecturers and staff share their\ntreasured movies with felix. This week: Back to the Future\nLook behind you...Is anyone there?\nOk... Please read on.\nThe aim of Secret Cinema is to surprise the audience. Before the actual\nday of the screening, the audience\ndoesn\u2019t know where the screening will\ntake place, what film will be shown,\nand what sort of side programme (with\nspecial guests) awaits them.\nAn e-mail message on the day of the\nscreening reveals the assembly point,\nand this is where you come and meet\nall the other secret moviegoers. The\norganisers then take you to the place\nwhere the screening will happen. I say\n\u2018place\u2019 because this could be practically\nanywhere: out on a farm or in a garden,\non a rooftop of some downtown build-ing, at a hotel parking lot, in a garage\nor in a tunnel.\nThe whole concept of the secrecy\nis aimed at bringing back the mystery\nto the cinema experience; it is aimed\nat adventurous cin\u00e9philes who despise going to the same old monotone\nmultiplexes to see the same old Hollywood trash. Tired of such cosmetic\n\u2018know-what-to-expect\u2019 experiences,\nthe Secret Cinema team decided cinema deserves to be more exciting.\nSecret cinema started in London in\nDecember 2007 and takes place once\na month. Given its popularity despite\ntheir somewhat expensive tickets (up\nto \u00a318), perhaps audiences really are\ngetting tired of boring and predictable\ncinema experiences.\nAnother interesting concept of making the cinema experience a bit different is the \u2018Bad Film Club\u2019 organised\nin an art-house cinema, Chapters in\nCardiff. Here you find two knowledgeable people commenting on the film\nas it is being screened. Those of you\nwho watch your DVDs with the commentary option \u2018on\u2019 might not find\nthis as much of a novelty though. Are\nthese two concepts perhaps the birth\nof a new wave of trying to attract audiences back to cinema in today\u2019s world\nof YouTube and Internet TV? I don\u2019t\nknow, but it is exciting: the closest to\nsecret cinema I ever got was sitting in\nan open air \u2018summer\u2019 cinema on an island in Croatia wondering whether the\nrain was going to spoil the ending of\nthe film for me!\nFor those of you who want to know\nmore and like being let in on a secret\ncheck out the following internet sites\n(secret or not, the internet has it all):\n\u201chttp://www.secretcinema.org/\u201d and\n\u201chttp://www.chapter.org/13283.html\u201d.\nBy the way, if anyone asks, I didn\u2019t say\nanything.\nP.S. Remember, tell no -one.\nWhy can\u2019t our lecturers be a bit more like Doc? Or maybe they are?\nMico Tatalovic\nTry before you die: Secret Cinema\nMy GOD, that is one sexy man. I mean WOW.\nCompetition\nL\nast time the competition\ndidn\u2019t go as well as planned\nand now I find myself still\nstuck with three DVD copies of Asylum. So let us try\nagain, and remember, all you need to\ndo is send the answer in an email, we\u2019ll\ndo all the work, track you down and\nhand you the prize.

The meeting would\nno doubt end in fierce argument but\nwould nevertheless give me a better\nunderstanding as to how sometimes\nseemingly rational people can hold\nviews that are so alien from my own.\nFreedom of speech is something\nthat we take for granted much of the\ntime, as clich\u00e9d as that sounds. We will\nchampion that old adage, the one that\nvehemently states that we \u2018may not\nbelieve what they have to say, but will\ndefend to the death their right to say it\u2019.\nIn practice though, much of the time\nit is difficult to accept differing views,\nI have seen many a political argument\nescalate after those involved have self-righteously proclaimed; \u2018I respect your\nopinion, but...\u2019 Of course you don\u2019t respect their opinion, you think that they\nare complete buffoons\u2026maybe I am\ngeneralising, of course I don\u2019t think I\nam, and if you do, well, you are an idiot.\nI jest, I jest dear reader, but you get the\npoint.\nAs an editor of this section I have\ncome across a number of articles\nthat I don\u2019t fully agree with. Myself\nand James publish them regardless, I\nam not arrogant (or knowledgeable)\nenough to believe that another\u2019s views\nare invalid. We as students with varied personalities and a diverse range\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso the 12th president of European Commission has\ncome to the conclusion that Britain is\n\u201ccloser than ever before\u201d to joining the\nsingle currency, the Euro.\nSpeaking in an interview with a\nFrench radio station Mr. Barroso said\nthat the \u201cthe people who matter\u201d were\nhaving second thoughts about Britain\u2019s long-held position as a bystander\nof the single currency. Mr. Brown, the\nPM, at the helm of the Labour party\nhas made no secret of the fact that it\nfavours entering the single currency\nbut not unless five economic tests, set\nby the Treasury, have been met.\nAs late at 2003 the Treasury ruled\nthat it was not in Britain\u2019s interest to\njoin the single currency. Mr. Barrosso\nwas further quoted as saying \u201cI know\nthat the majority in Britain are still op-posed, but there is a period of consideration under way and the people who\nmatter in Britain are currently thinking\nabout it.\u201d\nThe optimism of the Commission\nhas been fuelled by the comeback of\nLord Mandelson, previously the European Commissioner of Trade, who\nthis Saturday, at a Labour conference,\nspoke favourably of joining the Eurocontradicting Number 10\u2019s official line\non the Euro \u201cWe have no intention of\njoining\u201d.\nApart from sparking fury from the\nopposition party, the Conservatives\nsaid they will now table parliamentary\nquestions to establish what recent contact Lord Mandelson has had with Mr\nBarroso. William Hague, the Conservative shadow foreign secretary, said: \u201cIt\nis extraordinary that certain politicians\nare whispering to the EU Commission\nabout joining the Euro behind the British people\u2019s backs.\u201d\nMeanwhile sources close to Lord\nMandelson claim no discussion had\nbeen had with Mr. Barroso over Britain\u2019s Euro future. Joining the Euro\nwould require a referendum; a referendum is herald over by the elector-ate. The people that \u201cmatter\u201d are not\nthe Labour politicians now in office it\nis the other 60 million odd people of\nBarroso has claimed that Britain are considering joining the Euro\nKatya-yani Vyas\nPolitics Editor\nof views on everything from politics\nto soft drink flavours have the ability\nto write to this fine student newspaper\nand have our opinion published, embrace the opportunity dear reader, it\nis a privilege indeed. If you feel some\ndisillusionment with the content of the\npaper, write us a comment piece or an\narticle that takes the opposite view, I\nguarantee you will feel better.\nI can\u2019t say I was not taken aback this\nweek when the accusation was levelled against the newspaper that it was\npurely a medium to promote fascism,\nin addition to which I was told that I\nsimply must be a supporter of the conservative party purely based on the\nhighly convincing evidence that my accent is \u2018a bit posh\u2019. Considering James\u2019\nlast column was entitled \u2018In honour of\ncommunism\u2019, I was slightly perturbed,\nnevertheless, hopefully we will have a\ncomment piece from the particular fellow who felt so strongly about the political tone.\nI suppose the mark of a truly tolerant society is one where we are able\nto tolerate those who hold bigoted\nopinions, those who are not open-minded as well. This is the society\nthat we persevere to attain, so I will\ncontinue to listen to people telling me\nthat I am wrong and debating for argument\u2019s sake the content of an article.\nIf nothing else it makes my day more\ninteresting and hopefully tolerance will\nsucceed in elbowing its way into such\nconversations. For the sake of my sanity I sincerely hope so.\nA tribute to\ntolerance\nUK welcomes Euro\nthe UK. A recent poll by the Evening\nStandard found that 70% of the participants were against Euro entry.\nIt is beyond this correspondent what\nexactly Mr. Barroso is trying to achieve\nother than promoting the opposition\nparty\u2019s European policy, and thus the\nparty itself, and further distancing the\nBritish population from the EU.\nFood shortages: a growing worldwide dilemma\nDo you get your 2000 kilocalories a\nday? This is the minimum energy intake of an adult from food according to\nthe UN body the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization (FAO). Since you\u2019re in\nBritain, you probably do, but the answer to that question is no for 1 billion\nof the 6 billion people who inhabit this\nEarth.\nAs part of the Ahlulbayt Islamic\nSociety\u2019s campaign about the current\nEconomic Crisis, Mr Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed, Executive Director of the\nInstitute for Policy Research & Development (IPRD) gave a talk regarding the current crisis in food supplies.\nMr Ahmed began by making the point\nthat increases in food prices are causing riots around the world. Although\nnot reported widely in the news, 37\ncountries have seen food riots, including Indonesia, Morocco and Mexico.\nHere in Britain the consequences have\nbeen less severe with households seeing their weekly grocery bills increase\ndue to fluctuating prices over the past\nfew weeks, which have hit low-income\nfamilies the hardest.\nSince most Imperial students are not\nfarmers, it\u2019s difficult for us to remember that the food we eat \u2013 that Ploughman\u2019s Cheese sandwich sitting in its\nplastic container or the mandatory cup\nof coffee between lectures \u2013 actually\ngrew out of the ground at some point.\nAgriculture is that age-old human ac-tivity, but according to Mr Ahmed, it\nis the unsustainable industrial agriculture practiced across the world that\nis creating a food crisis. Some of the\nmechanisms for this, such as soil ero-sion, were explained. The intensive\ngrowing of crops today isn\u2019t compatible\nwith the fact that it takes 500 years to\nreplenish 1 inch of top soil, the result\nis lower productivity year on year. Water scarcity is an under-acknowledged\nissue; the NewScientist magazine reported that an average hamburger\ntakes 11,000 litres of water to produce,\nand like topsoil, fresh water is currently\nbeing used faster than water tables are\nreplenished. Pesticide Pollution and\nthe effects of Global Warming were\nalso discussed.\nLastly Mr Ahmed argued that monoculture \u2013 the growing of only one crop\nover a large area - is completely un-sustainable. Third world farmers face\npressure to grow only one \u201ccash\u201d crop\nto sell to huge corporate agricultural\ncompanies like Dupont and Cargill,\nwho in turn sell it to supermarket\nchains in developed countries. Instead\nof rotating crops or growing a variety of them, which would supply local\nmarkets, huge fields of cocoa or cotton\nare sown and their produce exported. Due to high exports, most farmers cannot even feed themselves\nColombia is not short of arable land\nand its biggest agricultural exports\nare coffee, tobacco and cut flowers,\nbut the Latin American country must\nimport other food to feed its popula-tion, of which 13% are undernourished\naccording to the FAO. India is another\nparadoxical case where, despite earning $1.2bn from exporting milled rice\nin 2004, a fifth of India\u2019s population is\nundernourished.\nOverall Mr Ahmed made a compelling argument, but he failed to address several common criticisms. For\nexample many advantages have been\ngained from the industrialisation of ag-riculture, like economies of scale and\nimproved yields, and what role would\nGenetically Modified food would play\nin a more sustainable agricultural sys-tem. Additionally the Peak Oil half of\nhis talk was not as well developed, with\na plethora of technical terms clouding\nhis argument.\nTerms like a Hubbert curve, Olduvai\ntheory and the opinions of petroleum\ngeologist Colin Campbell, are ones\nbest left for the hours spent browsing\nWikipedia.\nWorrying about feeding ourselves is\nsomething we don\u2019t do anymore in a\ndeveloped country like Britain. Our supermarkets are open 24/7 with a huge\nchoice of food, and the law requires\nmotorway service stations to be open\n24/7 to let us refill our fuel tanks and\nstomachs. And if you\u2019re annoyed that\nthe JCR closes at 6pm when you still\nwant a bite to eat, the Imperial College\nLibrary Caf\u00e9 is open throughout the\nHassan Joudi night! We live our lives assuming food\nwill always be available, but for many\npeople in the world most of their time\nis spent ensuring they get their 2000\nkilocalories a day just to survive.\nNeil Dhir\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n11\nFriday 5 December 2008 felix\nPolitics\nMohsin Asharia\nDubai faces criticism during hotel celebrations\nThis week saw the world\u2019s most expensive party, complete with the world\u2019s\nlargest ever fireworks display, marking\nthe launch of the world\u2019s most lavish\nhotel, in the city with the world\u2019s most\n\u201cworld\u2019s mosts\u201d.\n\u00a320m for the opening of Atlantis The\nPalm, Dubai is a small figure in relation\nto the \u00a31bn cost of the hotel itself, but\ncertainly enough to cause a stir. Kylie\nMinogue reportedly pocketed around\n\u00a32m for her 45-minute performance,\nand the fireworks display was over\nsix times that of the Beijing Olympics\nopening ceremony, and could be seen\nfrom space.\nThe extraordinary celebration is just\none example of Dubai\u2019s extravagance.\nThe city has, in recent years, become\nsynonymous with glamour, glitz and\nluxury. Burj Dubai, the world\u2019s tallest building, lies a stone\u2019s throw away\nfrom The Dubai Mall, which opened\nin a credit crunch-defying manner a\nfortnight ago. With four times as many\nshops as Westfield, I probably don\u2019t\nneed to add that it is the world\u2019s largest\nmall, and also houses the world\u2019s largest Gold Souk and an aquarium with\nthe largest viewing panel and largest\nschool of sharks on the planet.\nCombine all of this with perennial\nsunshine, white sandy beaches and tax-free salaries, and you may think you\u2019ve\ndiscovered paradise on earth. You\nwouldn\u2019t be the first; there are already\n100,000 British expatriates in Dubai. In\nfact, expats make up 80% of the city\u2019s\npopulation, most of them South Asian.\nHowever, despite its progress and opu-lence, even Dubai has adversaries from\nall angles. The launch of Atlantis The\nPalm was threatened by environmentalists\u2019 calls to free \u201cSammy\u201d the whale\nshark, one of 65,000 marine creatures\nin the hotel\u2019s aquarium. They claim the\nshark, which has since been confirmed\nDubai has recieved criticism from its people and from international organisations for the Atlantis hotel, the latest in a string of lavish projects\nfor release, was \u201ccaptured\u201d, whilst the\nresort say it was \u201crescued\u201d, close to Dubai\u2019s coast.\nMuch more voiced, however, are calls\nfrom Human Rights organisations to\nput a stop to poor conditions faced by\nlabourers. Many find it sickening that\nmillions can be spent on launching a\nhotel which was built by construction\nworkers earning as little as $10 a day,\nworking up to 60 hour weeks in the\nstifling heat in often dangerous condi-tions. Workers are given respite if temperatures reach 50 Celsius. It always\nseems to be 49. Despite this, the money that they earn goes a long way back\nhome, and many are forced to continue\nrisking their lives on a daily basis to\nprevent their wives and children back\nhome from starvation. Change in the\nnear future seems unlikely. Migrant\nworkers continue to flow into Dubai at\na rate of 800 a day.\nDubai may have become a victim of\nits own success. Local Emiratis are beginning to feel the influx of foreigners\nmay cause their heritage to disappear.\nAs one put it, \u201cwe are building towers but losing the Emirates.\u201d Others\nhave criticised the yo-yoing between\nthe state\u2019s culture and its appeal as a\nplayground for the rich. Drinking alcohol on the streets is forbidden, but\nthe guests at the Atlantis launch were\ntreated to Veuve Clicquot champagne.\nIn September, state-owned Dubai\nWorld bought a large stake in Las Vegas casino projects, despite gambling\nbeing outlawed as immoral in the\nUAE.\nEmirates airline boss Sheikh Ahmed\nbin Saeed al-Maktoum calls the UAE\n\u201chalfway between East and West\u201d. In\nmore than one sense, it is because of\nthis centrality, geographical and cul-tural, spiritual and material, that Dubai\nis being targeted from all sides.\nMalcolm X famously said, \u201cIf you\nhave no critics, you\u2019ll likely have no\nsuccess.\u201d Only time will tell, but the\nsuccess of Dubai\u2019s future may lie in the\nway it deals with its criticism.\nLabour party\u2019s hopes for re-election still alive\nRaz Jabary\nWith the next UK general elections\nscheduled for 2010, New Labour under\nPM Gordon Brown is fully operational\nin order to secure a fourth ruling term.\nWhereas until recent times there were\nexisting doubts as to the party\u2019s leadership and whether New Labour needed\na new face, current PM Gordon Brown\nis found to be more trusted by the British public than Conservative leader\nDavid Cameron when it comes to the\neconomy, a recent poll from the McCann Erickson advertising agency has\nshown.\nIn a time when Britain\u2019s economic\ncompetitiveness abroad is being threat-ened, and the Afghan and Iraqi peoples\nare in desire of a stable and prosperous\nfuture for their countries, a potential\nConservative government with no\nruling experience for the past eleven\nyears seems to be a conflicting idea.\nThe British people desired change, and\nchange came about at the New Labour\nleadership stage in June 2007. It seems\nthat most people in Britain would not\nhave a tendency to affiliate Mr Brown\ndirectly with the war in Iraq. Rather,\nduring a time when the unpopularity of\nthe Iraq war was at its highest, people\nperceived the new face of the Labour\nParty as a sign of hope for change, for it\nhas to be noted that many Labour MPs\nwere actually initially fiercely opposed\nto the Iraq invasion in 2003, which includes John McDonnell MP, a senior\ncandidate for the party\u2019s leadership.\nAfter the toppling of the Saddam\nHussein regime it was New Labour that\ninitiated an attempt of reconciliation\nbetween the British and Iraqi peoples\nwith the creation of Labour Friends\nof Iraq. In an interview with felix last\nmonth, Dave Anderson MP and Gary\nKent, chairman and director of Labour\nFriends of Iraq respectively, outlined\nhow they and other MPs had visited\nprominent Iraqi politicians \u2013 among\nwhich Iraq\u2019s PM Nouri al-Maliki \u2013 in\na bid to increase mutual understanding and friendship between the two\ncountries.\nThe recent win in the Glenrothes by-election for New Labour meant a substantial stimulus to the party. The seat,\nwhich some months before was predicted to fall to the Scottish National\nParty (SNP), was given away to Labour\nby residents who had just experienced\nBritain\u2019s vulnerability to a major economic downturn and how national\nunity ought to be a top-priority in such\ndifficult financial times.\nThe pre-budget report that was\noutlined by Chancellor Alistair Darling in the House of Commons on\n24th November means an important\ncontribution to business owners and\nhouseholds. A 2.5% cut in VAT (to be\nEurope\u2019s lowest) has to lead to a major\nboost in the UK economy of over \u00a312\nbillion, of which over \u00a31 billion will\ngo to job centres across the country in\norder to get people back to work and\ncut rates of unemployment. In a report to Labour party members on the\nsame day of the announcement, Mr\nDarling wrote of \u2018providing real help to\nfamilies and businesses at a time when\nthey need it most\u2019. He further claimed\nthat the Conservatives, unlike Labour,\n\u2018would rather turn their backs to these\ngroups and say that we should do nothing\u2019. Tory critics on the contrary claim\nthat Mr Darling\u2019s report seems to be\n\u2018more concerned with reaching out to\ndetached Labour voters instead of to\nthe greater benefit of the UK\u2019. On 25th\nNovember, the day after the report\nwas announced David Cameron even\ncalled for a parliamentary debate on its\ncontents.\nWith soaring political and economic\ncrises facing Britain in this first decade\nof the new century, among which most\nprominent the wars in Afghanistan\nand Iraq, terrorism, the banking sys-tem, the devalued pound, the demand\nfor more green, rates of unemployment\nand rates of crime, the British public\nfaces an ever-important event ahead\nin the next general election. Although\nthe greater majority of Britons would\nput their individual circumstances\nfirst when it comes to voting, it has to\nbe recognized that tough challenges\nahead for Britain require a strong unity\namong the people in order to effectively tackle these issues that are facing our\nsociety today.\nNew Labour, determined to seek another term in government, seems to be\nahead in providing the essential ruling\nand leadership experiences for this.\nDavid Cameron in trouble as Gordon Brown and New Labour have a resurgence in the opinion polls\n\n"

I think you will\nagree that she provided some interesting and yet very entertaining answers\nin her interview with Jack.\nOn a week where the temperature\ndropped dramatically, we have seen\nmany matches postponed/abandoned\ndue to frozen pitches and other similar\ncircumstances.\nThis leads nicely on to the ACC bar\nnight on Wednesday. Except for the\nfrozen gas regulator at the bar which\nput the free beers on hiatus for a short\nwhile, we are both sure that all the\nsports teams enjoyed themselves and\nspectacles such as the infamous boat\nrace are sure to be repeated in the upcoming bar nights.\nGracing the sports pages this week\nare reports from fencing, the outdoors\nclub, lacrosse and ultimate frisbee,\nwhich barring the hockey report are\nsome of the smaller sports and activities amongst Imperial. This by no\nAfter the twenty hour journey from\nLondon, it was quite a relief to be finally stepping off the bus as we digested our first views of Chamonix, our\nhome for the next six weeks.\nThe first thing we saw was a McDonalds. It wasn\u2019t very French but the places we stopped by on the journey hadn\u2019t\nsold anything in the way of real food.\nAfter surviving the journey on choco-late, ice cream and a tin of p\u00e2t\u00e9, a McDonalds breakfast seemed like luxury.\nThe first few days saw us finding our\nfeet and finding what Chamonix had to\noffer. Once the supermarkets, Maison\nde Guides and pub had been located\nwe went off for an acclimatisation\nclimb up on l\u2019Index.\nThe ascent was easy as fortunately\nthere is a cable car most of the way,\ntopping out with a scramble up to\n2600m. This felt quite high at the time,\nat least compared to anything in Britain, but we had much grander aspira-tions. After descending, plans were\nmade to move our camp up to the\nVall\u00e9e Blanche glacier where the team\nwould spend the next few days.\nThe team went for a quick acclima-tisation climb up the Cosmique Arete,\na popular mixed snow and rock route\nup to the Midi cable car station, before\ndescending back down to camp.\nThe team split up the next day. One\nteam chose the voie normale on Mont\nBlanc du Tacul (4248m), which despite\npushing some to their personal altitude\nrecord at the time, turned out to be uneventful and quite dull. The other team\ndecided to descend the Vall\u00e9e Blanche.\nThis had sounded like a good idea at\nthe top, but it soon became less so. After some delicate down-climbing, falling through snow bridges, and avoiding\nmulti-tonne blocks of ice falling across\nthe route in an epic adventure that Indiana Jones would have been proud of,\nwe made it back to the campsite.\nAfter that character building day out\nsome bad weather prevented us from\nreturning up high and so a few days\nwere spent recuperating in the valley.\nCoinciding with our tour, the Climbing World Cup was being held in town,\nwith both leading ability and speed\nclimbing being tested in separate\nevents. China did extremely well in the\nspeed climbing with one of their team\nclimbing 15m in 7.97 seconds.\nDuring the spells of bad weather\nthe team spent time at the many sport\nclimbing crags along the Chamonix\nvalley. This gave us a chance to explore\nand we even walked to Switzerland one\nday to get at some more crags! Every\nimaginable style of route was available\nfrom crack climbing or friction slab to\nsteep overhanging routes, in grades\nto suit any level of experience. It\u2019s no\nwonder that Chamonix is so popular.\nWe got back up high when the\nweather cleared, and established a new\ncamp on the glacier.

    "content": "8 felix Friday 5 December 2008\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment\n9\nFriday 5 December 2008 felix\nF\nirst off I need to thank\nA.Geek for inspiring me to\nfind a writer\u2019s name. I can be\nhorridly uninventive at times\nbut thanks to him I shall no\nlonger have to write as merely Unknown. I must say I found the reply to\nmy last article quite funny, even though\nI was just a tad upset that things didn\u2019t\nseem to come across as I wanted them\nto, ah well! I have a reiteration of the\nsame sort of idea written already but\nI\u2019m not going to bore people with the\nsame concept so soon\u2026 perhaps I\u2019ll\nsend that one in sometime next term.\nSo now allow me to get on with the\ntopic I want to address today. I really\nshould have commented on this last\nweek, but my lethargic nature and\nmy uncanny trend to procrastinate\ndelayed the effort of typing these few\nwords slightly.\nAs I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all aware there are\nat least two different forms of criti-cism; constructive and destructive. I\u2019m\nalso sure I don\u2019t have to explain how\nA.Geek\u2019s rant on Imperial Girl two\nweeks ago was definitely the latter. Now\nthat in itself is no problem, freedom of\nspeech comes with freedom of expres-sion, and if you put your opinions and\nviews out there you have to be ready to\nsee them torn apart, trampled on, spat\nat and pulled through the mud.\nHowever, while there is no doubt that\nsuch is acceptable, I wonder if it is necessary in many cases. What happened\nwith Imperial Girl went beyond criticism into mobbing and, for reasons I\nwill explore later, even into bullying\nin my opinion and resulted in nothing\nmore than some cheap laughs, the loss\nof diversity of views in our newspaper,\na surely insulted and hurt author and\nthe intimidation for other people to\nshare their more intimate views out of\nfear of having them similarly ripped to\nshreds.\nNow I happen to be a fan of A.Geek\nusually, he has a very witty way of writing and his articles can be quite amusing just as Gilead\u2019s elegant mastery of\nEnglish can be delightful to read even\nthough he lacks content at times. Also\nI disagree with a lot, if not most of, the\nideas in Imperial Girl\u2019s articles but that\ndoes not change the fact that regardless of my opinion, hers are just as\nvalid. Even though I do not agree with\nher, I find it interesting to see how she\nthinks. It brings diversity, a variety of\noutlooks on life and alone the fact that\nher view on life is so radically different\nto mine or what I usually read, alone\nthe fact that I\u2019m left wondering how\nshe got to the conclusions she did, it\nmakes her articles well worth reading.\nBut as popular as A.Geek maybe, he\nis absolutely no one to say who \u201chas issues\u201d and who has not. When someone\ncommits themselves to writing about\none\u2019s own feelings and thoughts like\nIG did, it\u2019s more than words that go\ninto the article. As soon as you write\nabout how you truly feel or think,\nyou\u2019ve opened yourself up and there,\nin between the jokes, fluff and prose, is\na certain part of you in that article. To\nthen have your views so aggressively\nassaulted from several fronts at once\nwith nothing held back, I can imagine\nhurts.\nWhen I saw the various reactions\nto IG tabloid take its course I was reminded of a scenario back in time\nthat I would imagine at least a few of\nthe students here will find familiar.\nPerhaps some of you remember that\n\u201ccool\u201d / \u201cpopular\u201d/ \u201cfunny\u201d guy in early\nSecondary. Perhaps some of you recall the quieter \u201cgeek\u201d who unlike his\npeers didn\u2019t think physics and maths\nwas all that bad. Nor did he think that\nthe black guy rapping off on how many\nniggas he killed or how many bitches\nhe fucked was all that awesome.\nPerhaps you recall how because he\nthought differently to the rest and\ndidn\u2019t follow the mainstream he was always the butt of jokes and never really\nfit in. Whenever he said something the\n\u201cpopular guy\u201d would mock it and the\ncrowd would all laugh amusedly and\nslowly but surely the \u201cgeek\u201d would stop\nbothering to give his input. A classic\nstory of the creation of an outsider.\nBut then again perhaps you have\nforgotten or never saw such a thing.\nFortunately the story has a happy end,\nbecause the \u201cgeek\u201d goes off to a good\nuniversity with likeminded people.\nHe even goes as far as writing to the\nnewspaper regularly and in his own\nway becomes quite popular amongst\nhis peers. He can proudly be who he is\nand express himself and all seems well.\nOh the irony is thus; that when in\nhis new environment emerges a person who seems to think differently to\nhim and the rest he resorts to mocking\nand attacking this. Backed by the many\nwho think alike, he works on making\nthat person who is different look stu-Suicidal-emo-girl? on tolerance, criticism, Imperial Girl and A. Geek\n\u201cAs soon as you\nwrite about how\nyou truly feel\nyou\u2019ve opened\nyourself up\nand there, in\nbetween jokes,\nfluff and prose, is\na part of you in\nthat article\u201d\npid and labels their views as ridiculous\nand pathetic until just as so many years\nearlier that person ceases to express\nthemselves the way they did.\nThat isn\u2019t criticism, it\u2019s no different\nto the bullying one would expect of\nimmature kids. It may be more refined,\nmore intellectual and justifiable by free\nspeech, but for anyone who gives it\nsome thought it is still no more than\nbullying.\nI would like to encourage IG to return\nto the newspaper, for if the authors in\nmy felix should have to be limited to\nthose whose articles appeal to the likes\nof A.Geek or alternatively those tough\nenough to take no heed of the aggressive feedback it will surely be a empty\nnewspaper. Funny, amusing perhaps,\nbut empty. I don\u2019t need someone to\nwrite stuff the way I see things for its\nnothing new, I\u2019m much more interested to hear those who think differently.\nTo conclude, in his last article\nA.Geek speaks of freeing little felix\nfrom his ball gag, and I could not agree\nwith him more. But censorship does\nnot only come in the form of outright\nprohibition to print something but can\nalso be generated more subtly by creating such an aggressive critical atmosphere that authors are intimidated to\nwrite as they want to in fear of being\nutterly flamed and bashed. In general\na bit more tolerance could do people a\nwhole lot of good.\nBut otherwise I still think you\u2019re a\npretty cool guy A.Geek. Comment\nover.

Presented by\none of the best teams of science journalists around \u2013 at least in Britain,\nwhere the paucity of good science reporting is worrying \u2013 Guardian Weekly is consistently thought-provoking,\nwitty, and, most important of all, in-formative. It comes out every week (if\nyou hadn\u2019t guessed), along with the\noccasional special edition, and usually\nruns to around 40 minutes.\nRecent podcasts have focused on,\namongst other things, Barack Obama\u2019s\nviews on science, space tourism, im-provisation, and Darwin\u2019s beard. Intrigued? If so, give the show a listen:\nyou (hopefully) won\u2019t be disappointed.\nMuch easier than picking up the news-paper, with added interviews \u2013 notable scientific celebrities include Sir\nMartin Rees, Marcus du Sautoy, and\nImperial\u2019s own Sir John \u2018Mr. Invisible\u2019 Pendry \u2013 plus special features\nand top-notch analysis from Alok Jha\nand his crack team of writers. And you\ncan listen while doing the washing up,\nsomething which I don\u2019t recommend\ntrying with the paper.\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/science/series/\nscience\nFelix Whitton reviews newspaper \u2018casts\nIt seems like an inevitable consequence\nof having things to do- we\u2019re going to\nhave to spend time pondering, avoid-ing, being distracted from the task in\nhand. But researchers studying procrastination think it can have serious\nhealth and financial consequences,\nand are looking for ways to conquer\ntime-wasting, potentially rendering\nFacebook useless.\nAround 90% of university students\nare time-wasters, according to University of Calgary economist Piers\nSteel, who describes procrastination\nas \u2018voluntarily delaying a course of action despite expecting to be worse off\nfor the delay\u2019.\nIt comes from a human urge to\navoid the unpleasant. Students are a\nhigh risk category due to their often\nhectic academic schedules and social\nMax Axiom\u2122: Super Scientist\nProcrastinators Anonymous\nMico Tatalovic\nScience Editor\nNY Times: Science Times\nThe NYT is\na journalistic heavy-weight,\nand as such\nyou would\nexpect a\nbruiser of\na podcast\nto go with\nsuch a reputation. But this is America,\nlest we forget, so any science must be\ndelivered in an earnestly folksy style,\nat the same time both patronising and\nyawn inducingly dull. So we have a\nshort snappy news bit; a quirky (read:\nirritating) \u2018health quiz\u2019, which makes\none wait until the end of the podcast\nto discover the answer (as if we care!);\nthe \u2018science minute\u2019 section (how very\nNew York); and gravel-voiced presenter and science editor David Corcoran\nintroducing guests and features. There\nare positives, the podcast manages to\nsqueeze a lot into less than 20 minutes.\nAnd they do look at \u2018serious\u2019 science\n\u2013 amid the bombardment of health\ngossip \u2013 such as last week\u2019s special \u2018Beyond the gene\u2019, which was illuminating,\nif annoying for me \u2013 as a biologist and\npedant \u2013 when the panel of journalists\nfell into the trap of talking about \u2018a gene\nfor so-and-so\u2019. There is also a global feel\nto the podcast, a nice change for anyone who has had to sit through hours\nof inward-looking US shows. So while\nthings are patchy stylistically, Science\nTimes partly atones for its sins by taking a serious, if at times humourless,\nlook at the world of science beyond the\nparochial borders of middle-America.\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/pages/science\nlives. Studies have shown that chronic\nprocrastinators have raised stress lev-els, and are prone to further risks to\ntheir health by putting off trips to the\ndoctor and the dentist. They are much\nmore likely to have accidents in the\nhome as they will avoid \u2018dull\u2019 tasks like\nchanging a lightbulb.\nProcrastination at work has financial consequences as time spent staring out of the window could be time\nspent productively badgering away.\nSteel believes certain character traits\nbring out the inner procrastinator,\nleaving some more prone. Time wasters are low in the conscientious trait,\nthey are less \u2018dutiful, organised and\nindustrious\u2019.\nThey are also likely to be impulsive-mixing up their intentions so being\neasily distracted. Anxiety can be im-plicit- a fear of failure can lead someone to put off starting a task.\nIf this sounds like you, or you\u2019ve no-Maxwell J. Axiom is no ordinary super-hero. He is no other than the super sci-entist! If you had any doubt about science being super, he\u2019s here to quench\nthat doubt. Born to a marine biologist\nmother and nuclear physicist/park\nranger father in Seattle, USA, he\u2019s got\nblack skin, brown eyes and no hair. He\nis the scientific version of Shaft, swift,\ndynamic, cool. His super-powers come\nfrom a lightning that struck him one\nday on a wilderness hike: it gave him a\nnewfound energy and motivated him\nto travel the globe and earn degrees\nin every aspect of science. Equipped\nwith this enormous knowledge that he\nwas ready to share, he assumed a new\nidentity: Max Axiom, Super Scientist.\nHis superpowers include super-intelli-gence, ability to shrink to a size of an\natom, time travel and X-ray vision. So\napart from breaking a few laws of physics in the start there, he does make up\nfor it by using all of his powers to explain the science to the readers.\nEarthquakes\nMax is in danger at the beginning\nof this comic, as his car is stuck on a\ncollapsing bridge. He gets saved by a\nrescue helicopter and flying becomes\nhis mode of transport. By the end he\ngets to fly in a helicopter, personal automatic hand glider and a private jet.\nIn addition he rides a sleek motorbike\nand scuba dives. No wonder, when he\ngets to visit the top of the Mount Everest, dive off the coast of Alaska back\nin 1964, fly over San Andreas fault in\nCalifornia and then go to Taiwan, and\nalso visit Iran after the devastating\n2003 earthquake and all this in just 23\npages.\nVolcanoes\nIn another one of episodes packed with\ntime and space travel, Max starts of on\nthe slopes of a volcano in Costa Rica\ndressed in some high-tech volcanologist suit; then he flies to a research vessel somewhere on the Pacific to take\na \u2018mini-sub\u2019 to the seabed to show us\nunderwater volcanoes forming new\nislands. He travels back in time to see\nthe eruptions and the after-effects in\nWashington in 1980, Martinique in\n1902 and Pompeii in AD 79, so apart\nfrom some learning about the tectonic\nplates, volcanoes and the composition of the Earth, we also get a bit of\nhistory.\nMagnetism\nThis is the famous episode where\nMax \u201cshrinks to the size of an atom\u201d\nin order to explain just how magnetism works at an atomic level. He also\nvisits ancient Greece where the word\nmagnet was first coined, it was named\nafter a region called Magnesia which\nwas littered with a naturally magnetic\nrock \u201cmagnesian stone\u201d. Another story\nsays magnets were first discovered\nby a Greek shepherd Magnes whose\nsandals (built with iron nails) were attracted to magnesian stones. Not even\nMax can tell us if this story is true, but\nhe sure makes sure we understand how\nand why magnets work in this fascinating comic.\nScientific Method\nWhat is so special about science; why\ndo we often put it before other kinds\nof knowledge? Some would argue it is\nthe scientific method that gives science its prestige and claim to objectiv-ity. But in order to decide if this is true\nor not one needs to understand what\nthis method is. Perhaps more importantly for would-be scientists is to see\nhow the scientists go about their daily\nwork: what is it that they do when they\npractice science? Philosophers and\nsociologists have argued for decades\nabout this, but Max explains the crux\nof it in this exciting episode that sees\nMax\u2019s city threatened by flooding from\na nearby river. The best way to decide\non how to stop the river is to follow\nthe scientific method to design the\nbest possible levee to prevent the river\nfrom overflowing. Forming hypotheses\nand testing them, making scaled down\nticed a stressed out friend with bad\nteeth and anecdotes of falling over\nin darkened rooms, help is at hand.\nOne strategy which has been shown\nto work is to set yourself attainable,\nspecific goals, instead of a vague goal\nwhich allows a get-out clause. So replace \u2018I will get fit\u2019 with \u2018I\u2019m going to\nthe gym tomorrow at 7.30am.\u2019\nPsychologist Tim Pychyl gives some\nnice parent-style advice: \u201cJust get\nstarted\u201d, the anticipation will be much\nworse than the actual task. To prove\nhis credentials, he carried out a survey\non his students, querying their moods\nand how much they were putting off\ntasks with deadlines.\nHe found \u2018when students actually\ndo the task they are avoiding, their\nperceptions of the task change signifi-cantly. Many times, they actually enjoyed it.\u2019\nSo do your homework, you might\nlike it\u2026\nProfessional procrastinator comic series PhD comic that regularly talks about the \u201cpower of procrastination\u201d\nmodels all feature in this episode.\nLight\nSunshine, sun-bathing, rainbows and\nlightning are all the phenomena Max\nattempts to explain in this episode.\nJust to make sure we understand it\nall he embarks on space voyage in his\ncompact space-shuttle, all the way to\nthe Sun to observe nuclear fusion that\ncreates energy some of which is visible\nlight. He also rides a beam of light at\nthe maximum possible speed in the\nuniverse, and obviously has a lot of fun\ndoing it! But we see here that Max is\nalso a human being, he visits a muse-um, has a cookie and a hot drink and\nrelaxes watching telly when his work is\ndone.\nIt\u2019s rumoured that Max can even \u2018down\u2019 a yard of ale in 3.32 seconds\nVAT and Imperial College Union\nFollowing the government\u2019s\nreduction in VAT on Monday, the\nUnion have changed our prices\nwhere applicable.\n\u2022 \u0007\nThe Union Shop and Newsagent\nhave reduced their prices and\nalthough some of the marked up\nprices have not changed yet, the\nprice you will actually pay at the till\nhas been reduced accordingly.\n\u2022 \u0007\nThe Union Catering\u2019s prices\nwill not change as VAT is not\napplicable to our food sales.\n\u2022 \u0007\nThe Union Bars\u2019 prices will remain\nunchanged due to the rise in the\nduty on alcohol cancelling out\nany change in prices that may be\npassed on to the Union by our\nsuppliers.\nimperialcollegeunion.org\n\n"

Force yourself (or\nsomeone else) to organise New Year\u2019s Eve\nplans before you end up alone... again\nP\nut the mince pie down (care-fully). Momentarily step\naway from the tinsel. It\u2019s\ntime to start thinking about\nmaking those dreaded New\nYear\u2019s Eve plans. Here is a fine selection of events in the capital for those\nwishing to start the year in style.\nAs the clocks strike midnight, there\nis one place guaranteed to have the\nooooh factor.; that clock in Westminster. Everyone has seen Big Ben, and\nthe spectacular fireworks detonated\nabove the Thames on television, year\nafter year. Will it meet up to expectation in real life?\nClearly the main problem with\nthis otherwise sensible plan, loutish\ncrowds. Revellers need a bar to provide the essential alcohol, shelter and\nwarmth. Hypothermia is not a good\nlook or way to start a new year. The\nWalkAbout Bar near Temple Tube Station is the obvious choice to meet your\nneeds. It faces onto the Thames, so the\nmidnight fireworks are on your door-step. The unpretencious Australian\ntheme, with DJs, relatively affordable\ndrinks and a modest entry fee should\nmake for a good all round experience.\nMatter\nWhat can you say? Once again, the su-perclub at the O2 has the mother of all\nline-ups. 2ManyDJs are headlining the\ncelebrations with an electroclash DJ\nset. For a duo with a DVD called \u201cPart\nof the Weekend Never Dies\u201d, I expect\nthere to be many fond memories of\nfrenzied midnight dancing. I wish you\na happy pilgrimage all the way to North\nGreenwich. Get home safely children.\nPeaches\nMay I suggest adding a new celebration\nto the calendar? An inspired club pro-motor has booked Peaches to perform\na DJ/MC set at Durrr\u2019s \u201cNot The New\nYear\u2019s Eve\u201d. The self-titled \u201celectrocrap\nqueen\u201d seems the perfect antidote to\ntiresome Christmas cheer. I pronounce\nthat the 29th December shalt henceforth be known as New Year\u2019s Eve Eve\nEve. Why has no one thought of this\nbefore? Hmmm.\nHow to describe Peaches? Well, she\u2019s\non a different planet to the likes of\nDido. She is glam-shock, provocative,\nvulgar and obscene. Perfect for rebelling against nostalgic festive tweeness.\nIndoctrinate yourself with the unofficial videos for \u201cFuck the Pain away\u201d on\nYouTube. Gossip Queen Perez Hilton\u2019s\nMiss Piggy version of this track is an\nexcellent intro for beginners. I\u2019m sure\nshe will be wishing \u201cGoodwilll to all\nmen\u201d this Christmas.\nGuanabara\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019d quite\nlike be at a beach party in Rio on New\nYear\u2019s Eve. Pyrotechnics, live music\nand waves gently lapping on the beach.\nIt\u2019s an image of perfection.\nBack home in London, you can still\nlive the dream at Guanabara, a Brazillian late night venue near Drury Lane.\nRevellion is the Brazillian new year\u2019s\nevent, a celebration originating from\nthe traditions of the Umbanda religion.\nThis Afro-Brazillian faith is based on\na mix of Catholicism and Spiritualism.\nRevellers dress in white, float candles\nin the sea and offer flowers to Iemanj\u00e1,\nthe Queen of Seas, in return for blessing the new year.\nAt Guanabara, DJ Mark Robertson from Spiritual South, Limao and\nD.Vyzor will be on the decks playing\nBrazilian sounds. Mandinga, samba\npopsters and London School of Samba\nwill be playing live.\n2ManyDjs will be wrecking up Matter and they are so good that light literally shines out of their arses\nPeaches isn\u2019t technically at The End on New Year\u2019s Eve but December the 29th is close enough\nIf you aren\u2019t lucky enough to enjoy Rio\u2019s floating Xmas tree, then Guanabara near Drury Lane is for you\nIf none of these events interest\nyou, alternatively there\u2019s a house\nparty at David J Paw\u2019s abode.\nCheck next week\u2019s issue for the\nfull details. The dress code is\n\u201c16th century surrealism\u201d.\nCatherine Jones\nNightlife Editor\nMince pies\ndown!\n\n"

Write to us.\nclubsandsocs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nClubs & Socs Editor - Alice Rowlands\nSpotlight on the Recreational Clubs Committee\nH\nave you ever found yourself having fun/ wanting\nto have fun whilst at Imperial? If the answer is\nyes then the chances are\nthat you are/ want to be a member of\na club that is part of the Recreational\nClubs Committee. Those of us in the\nRCC make our sole purpose in life to\ncater to the needs of the hard working Imperial student by providing you\nwith opportunities to maximise those\nrare occasions when you find yourself with some \u2018free time\u2019 (read: not a\ndeadline tomorrow). In short, the RCC\nhas a plethora of fun activities to suit\nyour every whim- from Belly Dancing\nto Wargames, Surfing to Mah Jong,\nand Caving to Wine & Fine Drinks\n(but preferably not at the same time)\nas well as our newest addition, RadioControlled Modellers. In essence, the\nRCC represents an eclectic mix of (oc-casionally quirky) clubs that satiate this\ncollege\u2019s craving for that Holy Grail\nthat we all must strive for: a life.\nNow that we\u2019ve convinced you of\nyour need to join one of these clubs,\nwe\u2019ve prepared a handy flow chart to\nhelp you decide which one/ones to\njoin. Its worth noting though, that this\nis by no means an extensive list- our diversity is so diverse that it\u2019s simply not\npossible to include them all, but that\u2019s\nnot to say that if its niche you\u2019re seek-ing, we can\u2019t provide- because we can.\nDo you sometimes find yourself yearning to look after a 100 year old fire en-gine? Or do you find Windows Vista\nthe bane of your life and have become\nan apostle of Linux? A full list can be\nfound at www.union.ic.ac.uk/rcc.\nAnd if you still feel there aren\u2019t\nenough hours in the day for fun, we\u2019ve\nalso got the annual RCC Night Hike\nfor your delight and amusement. Coming to you this February, it is always a\nnight of fancy dress, frustration (the\ngood kind) and frolics; guaranteed\nto leave an indelible mark on your\nhippocampus.\nRCC Chair Jenny Wilson and chums go through the ins-and-outs of the recreational side of student life\nWhy not try Parkour or Gymnastics:\nthese could both accurately be described as the skilled art of running\nand jumping over obstacles. A more\nsubtle difference is the nature of those\nobstacles. If parkour is your style, say\ngoodbye to brick walls stopping you\nin your tracks, for it becomes a question of which way to go around/over\nthe wall? On the other hand, if you are\nmore of a traditionalist then gymnastics is for you, where you can conquer\nyour fear of cartwheels and have a legitimate excuse for wearing a leotard.\nIf gravity is what\u2019s holding you back\nSynchronised Swimming is another\noption, particularly if you want more\nfrom a swim than badges.\nDo you like fun? Reconsider\nDo you have an \u201callergy to\nsweat\u201d?\nDo you embrace the geek\nweek?\nGEEK POSITIVE GEEK NEGATIVE\nDo you like running and jumping or adventure?\nRUNNING & JUMPING ADVENTURE\nAstroSoc and Street Magic could\nbe just up your alley. Think of it like\ntransforming your life at Imperial to\none akin to a life at Hogwarts, and simultaneously fulfilling that fantasy of\nyours/mediate your disappointment\nthat there wasn\u2019t a Hogwarts Uni option on UCAS. AstroSoc does more\nthan just looking at the sky- they have\nthings like \u2018star parties\u2019 and regularly\nhear from astronomers as well as going on excursions to our Wye campus\nto watch solar eclipses. Or for those of\nyou who need a better party trick than\nreciting pi to 100dp, knowing a bit of\nStreet Magic is a much cooler alterna-tive. If you\u2019re lucky, they\u2019ll even teach\nyou to conjure a lab report.\nFor you Lara Crofts/Indiana Jones\u2019\nwe have a range of adventure clubs\ncovering sky (with Gliding and Parachute), sea and rivers (with Canoe)\nand land (with Outdoor, Fellwanderers, Exploration and Mountaineering\nclubs, though admittedly the last prefer to traverse vertical surfaces). And if\nyou\u2019ve had enough of over-ground, we\nalso have Caving club to take you un-derground, or Underwater society for\nthose of you more aquatically inclined.\nThese provide the perfect chance to\nreally leave the city life; distance isn\u2019t\nreally a consideration for these adventurers as long as there is fresh air- even\nin a tank. Whatever the weather, they\nalways return with some exciting tales.\nFairly self explanatory in their nature,\nwhy not join Wargames, Chess, Backgammon, Mah Jong, Gaming (as in\ncomputers and consoles) or Web Design & Software if your style is more\nrelaxed. These clubs provide an indoor\nhaven for those who don\u2019t require frost-bite, trench foot or reality to have fun.\nThat\u2019s not to say of course that they\ndon\u2019t induce a similar adrenaline rush\nto their more physical counterparts,\nfrom cerebral achievements alone.\nThat\u2019s right, with these sorts you could\nwork towards taking on Deep Blue\n(the chess playing computer) or hack\nthe main frame with your new superior Perl or C++ skills (read: computer\nskills for geek negatives).\nYES\nNO\nSWEAT IS A WAY\nOF LIFE FOR ME\nSEVERE HIVES\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFood\nFood Editors \u2013 Afonso Campos & Rosie Grayburn\nDavid Paw eats steak\nphere, service \u2013 are available in spades.\nGrab a table if you can \u2013 table service\nis quick and efficient, and takes any potential stress out of the proceedings.\nAfter just over the 30 minutes had\nelapsed, we were shown to our seats.\nThe setup at Sophie\u2019s \u2013 unlike so many\nspace-starved London eateries \u2013 is a\nwelcome relief. The tables are perfectly\nplaced for people watching and come\nwith a claustrophobia-free guarantee.\nWhile this isn\u2019t the perfect setup for an\nintimate date, I would hazard a guess\nthat watching a previously-attractive\ngirl/boy devour a plate of near-raw\nmeat could be quite a turn-off.\nThe a la carte is a carnivore\u2019s delight,\nand almost everything on the menu\nwas a tempting proposition. The list of\nstarters was mercifully abbreviated too,\noffering perfectly rendered classics like\ncalamari and dressed Cornish crab.\nBut of course, the star attraction was\nwhat we, and most of you, will venture\nto WC2 for, and though the list wasn\u2019t\nas comprehensive as other steakhouses\n(say, either a gargantuan 20oz piece, or\na proportionally-challenged 8oz cut),\nat least it was to the point.\nBetween us, we ordered the Porterhouse and two portions of the Cote\nde Boeuf. After a very brief wait, the\nwaitress set down what can only be\ndescribed as three monstrous slabs of\nbovine joy on our table. With a smile\nSophie\u2019s Steakhouse HHHHK\n29-31 Wellington St, WC2E 7DB\nPhone: 020 7352 0088\nwww.sophiessteakhouse.com\nBest: Incredible meat-binge\nWorst: The fries... oh those\nfrench fries\nPrice: \u00a325/30 per head\nand wink she chirruped \u201cEnjoy!\u201d and\nleft us to contemplate the task at hand.\nHowever, unlike cooking a steak at\nhome, which almost inevitably turns\nout too well-done, too cold, too-un-derseasoned, and almost always with a\nlacklustre accompaniment (in my case,\na couple of glasses of Cooper\u2019s), restaurant steak is always a tongue-searingly\ndelicious, melt-in-the-mouth, disgustingly tender and perfectly balanced\nexperience. My steak started dark pink\nbut became intriguingly and deviously\ndarker as I moved towards the centre\nof the cut, gaining in intensity and fla-vour. It was so easy to cut I could have\neaten it with a pair of chopsticks, and\nthe flavour so satisfying the accompanying fries and salad was only resorted to during moments of guilt at the\noverindulgence.\nSpeaking of which, despite the quality of their beef, Sophie\u2019s really need\nto do something about their chips. If\nthe most hard-up, fiscally-challenged\nchipshop in the most Godforsaken\npart of Northern England can conjure\nup pure potato magic with a deep fat\nfrier, a sack of Tesco\u2019s value spuds and\nsome salt, then I do not think it is too\nmuch to ask a respected establishment\nlike Sophie\u2019s that charges \u00a32.50 for a\npaltry squirt of Coke to produce something decent from whichever laboriously selected supplier provides them\nwith potatoes. Hot. Crispy. Golden. It\nisn\u2019t brain surgery, chaps.\nDespite the oversights on the part of\nthe kitchen however, Sophie\u2019s is still a\nworthy affair. It has the right ingredients to be a resounding success. The\nmanagement understand that no one\nwants to get dressed up to eat what\nis essentially the most primitive and\nbasic meal of them all, and that while\ntoo formal is bad, not formal enough\nis worse (no novelty steak sauces or\nballoons in sight). Sophie\u2019s has hit the\nright balance, and has integrated the\nbonus of a great bar. Let\u2019s just hope\nthey get those chips right next time.\nThe second outpost of the venerable\ninstitution on the Fulham Road, Sophie\u2019s Covent Garden screams \u201cNYC\u201d\nfrom the moment you step through\nthe front doors. Everything from the\nspace itself \u2013 a single huge, expansive room more SoHo loft than Soho\nsquat \u2013 to the luxurious banquettes\nand oversize vase dominating the front\nentrance, gives off an irresistible party\natmosphere. The room\u2019s liberal use of\ndark woods and gorgeous, earthy reds\npaired with a mass of elegant, spiralling hyphae-like LED lights adds to\nthe mood, giving an impression of a\nparty deep in a forested grotto. Front\nreception are frantic dealing with impromptu attendees (the restaurant has\na no-booking policy to push the casual\nfactor up), and bar staff rush back and\nforth mixing oversized martinis.\nThey needn\u2019t worry though. While\nhalf the evening\u2019s clientele sink their\nteeth into enormous, perfectly cooked\nsteaks, the other half are sat back soaking up the buzz and kicking back at the\nbar. You don\u2019t get a vibe this relaxed at\nGaucho. We put down a reservation\nwhen we arrived, and we were told it\nwould be about 30 minutes before our\nnumber would flash up on one of the\nsmall electronic boards dotted about\nthe walls. So, we went through a few\nvery acceptable mojitos. Open until\n2.30am, long after the kitchen closes,\nthe bar itself is an attractive proposi-tion.

The\none supposedly no-one knows about?\nRosie wrote about it at some point...\nNo? Brilliant. I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t. Why\nis it refreshing that you have no clue\nabout it? Mainly because I like it.\nBecause my friends like it. Because\nnormal people who go there like it. I\nhave been going there since my first\nterm at Imperial and immensely enjoy\nhow peaceful it can sometimes be. I\nusually like to go there late at night to\ngrab a pizza and read any paper that\nis not overly commie, or have a quiet\nchat with my friends. There\u2019s something special about it. I don\u2019t know\nwhat it is \u2013 perhaps the feel of a place\nthat knows itself and does not need\nto try to be just another run-of-the-mill expensive coffee shop, sacrificing\nreal-world authenticity for those extra\nbucks. Or pounds. Whatever. The\npoint is, the place is authentic, unpre-tentious, and well... nice. Pretty nice.\nBecause of that, I don\u2019t especially\nlove it when the place is filled to the\nbrim with Imperial students being\nloud and obnoxious. Please don\u2019t\nget me wrong though \u2013 everyone is\nallowed to go wherever one wants,\nwhenever one wants.

Christmas\ncame early for some of you, as I will be\ndishing out some better-than-average\nadvice. And guess what? For free. Go\nto Starbucks. Seriously dude, it\u2019s right\nthere and you will look much cooler\ndrinking your triple venti eggnog latte\nwith a shot of vanilla, no sugar, extra\nfoam, low temperature rabbit\u2019s sperm\nand Jesus\u2019 tears than you could ever at\nHouse of Coffees.\nI know we reviewed this place, but\nI seriously don\u2019t want you there. Also,\nsince when does a review constitute\nan invitation? This clear misconception has led some of my favourite\nplaces in London to be inundated by ...\nugh...

In fact, I encourage you to\ndo so. I ask however, that if you do\ngo, you respect the people who make\nit either their comfortable second\nliving room or enjoy the very simple\npleasures that place somehow brings\nto those that manage to find beauty in\nthe supposedly banal and mundane.\nOn a totally unrelated note; how\nawesome is my cardigan?

Simple enough, one may think\nbut what does it actually mean? Terror\nis not an ideology like Communism or\na \u201crogue state\u201d like North Korea. It is\nthe utilisation of desperate, disorien-tated and frustrated na\u00efve young people by older, more calculated individuals who remain hidden but wish their\nown atrocious agendas to be met.\nI sincerely hope that India does not\nfollow what America did after 9/11\nfor many reasons.

Put\nsimply, this is an attack that the West\n\u2013 those crusaders against terror can relate to. Though we can only speculate\nat this moment in time about the motives behind the Mumbai attacks, we\ncan be certain that, unlike 9/11, it has\nnothing to do with America\u2019s foreign\npolicy in the Middle East.\nSecondly, who on Earth would wish\nto follow the actions of the Bush Administration? This is a government\nthat instigated a war against an enemy\nstate after only loosely associating it\nthe Airliner attacks. Let\u2019s not forget\nthat the Taliban government did not\nfund, coordinate or aid the attacks on\nthe Twin Towers and Iraq\u2026. Well they\nwere included as part of the war on terror but as hindsight is always 20:20, we\nnow know that the reasons for going to\nwar had nothing to do with this global\nbattle against terrorism.\nAnd finally; though Westminster was\nequally guilty of this, why would one\nstrip their country\u2019s constitution of civil liberty by such acts as the Prevention\nof Terrorism act here and the Patriot\nact in the US? By sacrificing freedom\nfor safety one deserves and will achieve\nneither, this is how it works:\nThose who are profiled as being high\nterror suspects due to what a profile of\na terrorist is, would have their civil liberties quashed \u201cfor the sake of national\nsecurity\u201d. A community that feels victimised due to what they hold dear regardless of what it is: be it religion, ethnicity or country of origin \u2013 as the case\nmay be in India now that one of the\nterrorist was found to be a Pakistani\ncitizen \u2013 would feel resentful and angry with no idea of how to make their\nviews heard. Of those, a suggestion\nable and angry few would be utilised as\nfoot soldiers to commit senseless acts\nof terrorism on defenceless civilians\nand so the cycle is perpetuated.\nIn closing, these attacks are more\nthan ghastly, yet if the response is a\nknee-jerk one then we will do nothing but cause suffering to those caught\nin the cross-fire and encourage a new\noppressed and frustrated generation\nof would-be terrorists, who will have\ngrown up in countries that have come\nto accept civil-rights violating laws in\nthe name of national security.\nI\nhad the choice not to respond.\nI had the choice not to write\nagain. I had the choice to give\nin. But of course I didn\u2019t get into\nImperial with that submissive\napproach. Angry Geek, you really are\ntoo angry. I take on board your criticisms about my grammar but I don\u2019t\nagree with your attitude to the context\nof my columns. I write to share MY experiences as a girl at Imperial; it\u2019s not\nfor you to disregard me, as crude or as\nunimportant you might find them.\nThreats in your last comment, \u201c...\nhave formed a militia with the intent\nof murdering you in your sleep\u201d- A.\nGeek, are seriously not appreciated.\nI may talk of female issues that you\nfind offensive but in every language,\nthat act of violent murder is definitely\nNOT funny or witty and is unlikely to\nbe tolerated by anyone on Campus. I\nread the psychiatrist is great at Imperial; perhaps you should take a look in\nbecause that is a ridiculous comment\nto attack me with.\nAt first, I was quite hurt by your response and shocked that you choose\nto publicly announce your views about\nmy column is such a derogatory way\nto women \u201cLoose-Women\u201d- A. Geek,\nwithout emailing me first. Then I remembered the numerous emails I\nhave received and feedback that I have\nheard from girls and some guys who\nenjoy reading my column and decided\nnot to let your opinions affect the readers chance to enjoy reading what I have\nto say.\nSo please, although I am flattered by\nall the attention you are giving me, you\nkeep to your side of the sheet and I\u2019ll\nkeep to mine. I suppose if you mention\nme again we will all just have to assume\nthat you have run out of things to write\nabout, I mean there are only so many\ntimes you can write about Wikipedia\nuntil the Imperial body thinks that the\ntoilet paper in Sherfield is a better read\nthan your column. :)\nSo I carry on regardless. Recently, I\nhave been exploring the idea of adop-tion, bought about by a discussion I\nhad with a relative. She feels that she\nwill be unable to find a partner soon\nenough to have a child of her own.\nSo I suggested adoption to her, and\nit got me thinking. Adoption. Is it for\neveryone?\nWhen I was in Year 8 my English\nteacher was talking about some literature that discussed the subject of adop-tion. At the end of the class, she passed\nby a friend and I and started talking.\nShe admitted she wanted children but\ncouldn\u2019t have them. Adoption was out;\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t do that\u201d she says \u201cbring up\nsomeone else\u2019s child\u201d (the hint towards\nthat the parents might be unsavoury\ncharacters and may have passed on\nthese characteristics to the child).\nAdoption has become \u201cAll the rage\u201d\nwith the endorsement of celebrities\nsuch as Angelina and Madonna. But is\nit a dangerous game? Many may know\nof the Woody and Mia case where the\nthen couple adopted a child called\nSoon-Yi who then went on to marry\nher guardian Woody. He is now 71\nand she is 36 and they have been happily married for 10 years. Not to say\nthat all adopted children will marry\ntheir guardians but there are other\ncomplications.\nTake the Jolie case where many bogus\nclaims were made to acknowledge that\nbaby Zahara Marley Jolie-Pitt was actually their biological grand-daughter\nor otherwise daughter. What happens\nwhen the parents of the adopted child\nwant back in to that child\u2019s life, perhaps\nfor financial motives, emotional attachment and alike? What if the child\nwants to know who their biological\nparents are? Does this system make an\nadopted child search for closure in unanswered questions for the rest of their\nlives and equally the mother that willingly or unwillingly gave up their child\nso long ago?\nIt undeniable that a child might know\nwithout being told that they are adopted but what\u2019s assured is that if a mother\nis desperately seeking a child and has\nthe ornate need to be a mother she will\novercome all these barriers. There are\ntoo many children left stranded in this\nworld to deny them a chance of a family or just a mother. China\u2019s orphaned\ngirls are of the most highly publicised,\nreasoned the result of the One Child\nPolicy. Adoption is a lengthy process\nthat can often take years, in which time\nmany of these orphans may pass.\nAdoption is not without its red tape\nbut if a someone wants to adopt none\nof these factors should stop them.\nWhat do you think? - email me, ImperialGirl@imperial.ac.uk.\nBAM! A.Geek hits the deck! That\u2019s a brutal left hook from Imperial Girl\nI\nn the forty-odd half-baked little ramequins of whimsy that\nI\u2019ve rammed down your throats\nover the fifteen months spent at\nthis glorious institution, I have\nonly once embarked on what could be\ncalled a rant. A stream of violent abuse\nemerged from my own fair hands in\nMay of last year, as I tore into YouTube\ncommenters in a wholly cathartic vituperative frenzy. The video that sparked\noff that uncharacteristic outburst, in\none of those twists Agatha Christie\nwould have struggled to concoct, was\nalso the inspiration for the FROTHY\nquiche of delight you now see before\nyou.\nThe video in question was a 192-sec-ond long extract from the movie\n\u2018Cabaret\u2019, wherein a suitably blonde,\nblue-eyed Aryan youth sings a gentle berceuse to the beauties of the\ncountryside.\nAs the camera pans out to reveal the\nHitlerjugend cap on his blue hair and\nthe demented look in his blonde eyes,\nthe entire biergarten is seen joining\nhim in a rousing chorus of \u2018Tomorrow Belongs To Me\u2019. A terrifying clip\nthat offers us one of the most enduring\ncinematic clich\u00e9s of pre-war Germany.\nLots of scope for vapid, sinister or be-wilderingly stupid video posts, I\u2019m sure\nyou\u2019ll agree. One year and 784 posts\non, the reasons for my little explosion\nare still painfully clear.\nBut I am a better man. The most disturbing Cabaret-related item I was able\nto find online this time round was that\na remake starring Renee Zellwegger\nis up in the air. I hope and pray to my\nImmoral Atheistic Nonentities that it\nnever comes back down. There comes\na point when the idea of remakes, revivals and sequels leaves the platonic\nworld of tribute and respect far behind\nand plunges itself headlong into the\ncrass world of commercialism.\nReproducing an artist\u2019s work before it\nhas truly faded from the collective consciousness is as insulting as it is lazy.\nImitation maybe the highest form of\nflattery, but a work needs to be allowed\nto rest: the cauldron of creativity has to\n\u201cPeople with\ncreativity\nshouldn\u2019t be\nincited to tap\ninto lucrative\nveins of\nenthusiasm they\ndidn\u2019t generate\u201d\nAngry Geek drags\nup MMR again... it\u2019s\nnot his fault, honest\nsettle before the film of inspiration can\nbe stirred by the ladle of reinterpreta-tion. The motivation behind artistic\nendeavour should not be a desire to\nfeed off a collective nostalgia. People\nwith originality, creativity and vision\nshould be encouraged to embark on\ntheir own projects, not incited to tap\ninto lucrative veins of enthusiasm they\ndidn\u2019t generate. At the present rate of\nthings, the entirety of cinema history\nwill be rewritten every fifty or so years,\nin progressively sharper colours and\nwith increasingly tighter dialogue.\nTake the Old Testament \u2013 a work\nblinding in its originality and breathtaking in its scope - a text that has\nformed the bedrock of Western civilization and that no self-respecting hotel bedroom should be without. How\nwould it feel if some local studio chiefs\ndecided to commission a remake? An\nupdated version with an all-star cast\nand none of the unnecessary boring\nbits that were in the original? Something that captured the spirit of the\nday?\nSure, let\u2019s make the God character\na little friendlier. Let\u2019s cut some of the\nexplicit sex and violence in order to\nget a PG or U rating. Let\u2019s insert a like-able, central protagonist and have him\nbe a little more tolerant than some of\nthe guys in the original. You know, to\nget the kids involved. You can guess\nthe punchline to this Mitchell & Webb\nsketch: the New Testament is released\nin cinemas globally and has massive\nreturns at the Box Office. Lucifer vies\nwith Saint John the Baptist for the\nBest Supporting Actor Oscar while the\nAlmighty makes a clean sweep of the\nSpecial Effects prizes for the second\nyear running. Talk of a television series\nis scrapped as Jesus reveals he won\u2019t be\nable to make the filming dates: a shame,\nbut maybe we could shift the focus onto\na secondary character. \u2018Saint Peter: the\nPearly Gates\u2019 goes into pre-production\nand the franchise keeps on growing.\nSeeing as I began with films set in\nI\npicked up the Metro again this\nweek, fresh from including it in\nmy column not so long ago. In\na way, I was asking to be pissed\noff, but the promise of their new\nsection intrigued me. Turns out that\nmy claim of them stealing stuff from\nthe Internet wasn\u2019t so far-fetched, as\nthey now have a section dedicated entirely to that.\nUnbelievable quality journalism,\nright there hard-hitting coverage of a\nwalrus with some kind of flute, accompanied by an explanation that - animal\nlovers may complain- but hey, fuck\nthem, this is a walrus with a goddamn\nwind instrument!\nAs I leafed, I came across The Story.\nThe Story concerns the MMR Baby\nthat died ten days after receiving an\narguably controversial inoculation. It\ndidn\u2019t get many column inches, presumably because the paper was all\nbabied out, what with coverage of the\nterribly-named doom babies, Faith and\nHope, and the baby made for tabloid\nheadlines, Baby P.\nYet despite being consigned to the\ndepths of the inner pages, the MMR\nBaby still makes a good headline, containing both the word \u2018baby\u2019 and \u2018died\u2019,\npart of the holy trinity of sensationalist\njournalism.\nBut why would I be angry about the\ndeath of an adorable, innocent child?\nWhy. I\u2019m such a bastard. There\u2019s even\na photo of him, and he definitely looks\nlike he was going to grow up to be\nPrime Minister or something. I\u2019m such\na shit.\nWell. Back history for those uninitiated with the wonders of the MMR.\nThe Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine is an injection given to children to\nprotect them from some pretty horrific\ndiseases. They used to come as three\nseparate stabs in the arm, but medical genius managed to cut that down\nto just the one some years back now.\nEveryone\u2019s happy, in theory. Until the\nalleged link with autism hit the press,\nand everything went into the toilet. All\nacross the universe, a million women\ncried out in unison, \u201cAs a mother, I...\u201d\nand then fell silent.\nOnly it wasn\u2019t silence, it was really\nloud shouting and the most comedy-sized gigantic headlines you could possibly imagine.\nDespite the fact that a lot of the fuss\nsurrounding MMR has died down\nnow, it\u2019s still a good demon to drag out\nof the underworld once in a while and\nbeat to death with the journalism stick,\nso naturally this story was a good one.\nWho cares why the baby died, all that\nmatters is that someone died, and the\nMMR jab is to blame.\nPresumably, then, the journalists\nwere quite disappointed upon talking\nto the parents and discovering their\nbaby died because they weren\u2019t keeping an eye on his temperature. This is a\nchild with a rocky medical history any-way, and the parents claim his death\ncame about because they weren\u2019t told\nto watch over the child following the\nvaccination.\nI\u2019m sorry? I mean, assuming this was\nactually true, and they weren\u2019t told to\nwatch their own son - which is hugely\nunlikely, as it\u2019s about the only thing you\ncan get nurses to say nowadays - and\nthen, then assuming that they weren\u2019t\nhanded a bunch of paperwork saying\nexactly the same thing - almost as un-likely, since the one universal constant\nof medical treatment is that you leave\nwith lots of bits of paper telling you\nto sit very still in a dark room for four\ndays - even assuming all of this, are you\nhonestly telling me that these parents\ndid not consider to watch their own\nson?\nWhat in God\u2019s name are they think-ing?! My GP doesn\u2019t tell me not to\ninject heroin into my eyeballs, but I\nstill don\u2019t add it to my to-do list. And\nthat\u2019s when I began to feel the pangs\nof guilt, because God knows I\u2019m a fan\nof bitching about the NHS. There are\na lot of incompetent people working\nfor them, mainly because they insist on\nhiring \u201chumans\u201d for some reason. I\u2019ve\nbeen done over a lot of times, and family members have fallen pretty ill owing to their mistakes. But there\u2019s always\na line you have to draw, isn\u2019t there?\nThere\u2019s always that point at which you\nhave to say that maybe, maybe this isn\u2019t\nsomething we should be complaining\nabout?\nOkay, so a cute little baby died. We\nwant someone to blame. But throttling\nthe NHS \u2013 just as throttling social services with the Baby P fiasco \u2013 is unlikely\nto help things. These institutions exist\nbecause they get things right most of\nthe time. That\u2019s a fact. The only thing\nto be angry about in the case of this\nchild\u2019s untimely death is that he wasn\u2019t\ncared for better.\nLet me know how little I know\nabout medicine and/or caring for\nchildren by sending your flaming\npitchforks to anangrygeek@goog-lemail.com.\n\u201cWhat in God\u2019s\nname are they\nthinking?! My\nGP doesn\u2019t tell\nme not to inject\nheroin into my\neyeballs, but I\nstill don\u2019t add it\nto my to-do list!\u201d\nNazi Germany, I feel tempted to quote\nthe line from Pimpernel Smith: \u2018The\nmind of man is bounded only by the\nUniverse\u2019.\nPlatitudinous and unimpressive\nwhen seen out of its original context\nas a codephrase for Jewish intellectuals to escape from German clutches,\nperhaps, but true nonetheless. The\nproblem with that, of course, is that the\nUniverse is a pretty limited place to begin with. Things exist in patterns and\nrhythms, with repetitions and recurring features: the very fabric of the cosmos obeys phenomenally simple laws\ngoverned by mathematics that even a\nhuman mind is capable of grasping.\nJust as the infinite possibilities existing\nin nature lie in variations on a theme,\nso the most original of our inventions\nfall into the same trap.\nThe theory has been proposed that\nall stories, whether taken from the\narcana of Norse Mythology or the final assignments of first-year creative\nwriting students from American arts\ncolleges, fall into five basic categories.\nThere are five ways we have managed\nto express our Universe in verbal form,\nand all the rest, as the preacher might\nsay, is vanity.\nWhile not subscribing to the idea\nthat five is necessarily the golden\nnumber, we are clearly limited in the\nmeans of communication open to us.\nEvery novel is in some sense an adaptation of an earlier publication, each play\nor sonata a pastiche of an earlier work,\nand all films remakes or parodies of\nthose that came before.\nWe can\u2019t help repeating ourselves,\nand our artistic footprints are so large\nthat we end up crossing our own paths\ntime and time again. There should,\nhowever, be limits to how eagerly we\nrun around in circles. When this particular frothy souffle of enchantment is\nupdated to a 22nd Century audience,\nfor instance, it would be a shame if\npeople watch the 2012 version of \u2018Cabaret\u2019 to get a feel for my message.\n\n"

    "content": "24 felix Friday 5 December 2008\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nTechnology\nTechnology Editor \u2013 Ravi Pall & Richard Lai\nArtificial Intelligence\nJoseph Letts wonders if it an essential tool for students?\nI\n'm sorry to seize you in with such\nan irrelevant title! It took me a\nwhile to work out what my first\n(possible) article for felix would\nbe, and after some wild guesses I\nwent with Artificial Intelligence. We all\nsee robots in the movies, and computers which can take over the world (in-sert: Arnie and Skynet) and although it\nis not at the front of everybody\u2019s mind,\nsooner or later on an empty day, you\nstart wondering, what would it be like if\ncomputers could think for themselves?\nSo, the first question is: what defines\nartificial intelligence? When we think\nabout artificial intelligence in terms of\nits popular culture reference, we tend\nto think that it revolves around the idea\nof machines which act self-dependent-ly from humans, capable of premeditated murder (think iRobot), and with\ngeneral megalomaniac tendencies (e.g.\nthe Matrix). A useful scientific definition I have found states:\nArtificial intelligence is the study of\nthe computations that make it possible\nto perceive reason and act.\nExtract from: Chapter 1, Artificial\nIntelligence by Patrick Henry Winston\n(3rd Edition).\nBut what does that mean when it \u00eds\nat home? Essentially, it means that artificial intelligence describes the field\nof study which enables technology to\nreact and carry out decisions based\non inputs from its environment. During my web research about AI, I\u00edve\nrealised that it covers a much broader\ntopic than I anticipated, branching off\ninto different sections. Some forms\nof AI are already being implemented,\nexamples being route finding systems for complex transport networks,\nhandwriting recognition software and\nspeech synthesizers. These systems\nare capable of learning and making\ndecisions, e.g. text-to-speech systems\nwhich study patterns in language to\nimprove their chance of synthesising\nwords, or handwriting recognition systems which can adapt themselves to a\nuser\u2019s handwriting to reduce the probability of mistranslation.\nHowever, there are some problem\nareas of AI which still cause trouble to\nour scientists in the present day. One\nof these is the problem of perception,\nwhich would enable a machine to determine its place in its current environment and plan a suitable route for\nnavigation to certain areas or for es-cape. The ultimate application of this\nwould be the futuristic motorways in\nmovies, where cars drive on auto-pilot\n(how ironic) at high speeds without\nany trouble at all.\nWhile some parts of this problem\nhave been simplified, one of the main\nstumbling blocks involves the way in\nwhich machines view the environment.\nAs humans, we naturally see the world\nin terms of distances, and objects\n(with which we can\ninteract) because\nour brains do all\nthe work for\nus. In comparison\nmachine processors only receive what\nthey see by analysing data received\nfrom visual inputs (i.e. cameras). The\nmachines then have to calculate the\nperceived location of objects in their\nvision (easier with two cameras than\nwith one) as well as classify these\nobjects.\nHumans have an easy job of classifying families of objects; it has been\nhard for researchers to quantify the\nprocess involved, and so making\nit harder to simulate the process\non machines, leading to large\ndatabases of images, stored\nfor the sole purpose of object\nrecognition.\nAn interesting advance seen in\nArtificial Intelligence which is close\nto home is the Painting Fool. A project\nstarted by Dr. Simon Colton (Doc) in\n2001, the painting fool is an AI program which makes artist\u2019s impression\nof pictures of people and landscapes.\nThe program has recently been enhanced with help from Michel Valstar\n(DoC PhD 2008) and Dr. Maja Pantic\n(DoC), who provided another AI computer vision program which uses a\nvideo feed to detect the emotion on a\nsubject\u2019s face. This information is then\nfed to the painting fool, which uses the\ninput to paint an abstract portrait, using different colours and perspectives\nfor each emotion.\nThe next goal of the painting\nfool is to become creative,\ni.e. become able to paint\nnew pictures without\nan input.\nThis brings forward the topic\nof machine\nconscious-ness. The\nexamples\nthat I\u2019ve discussed so\nfar all concern systems\nwhich are\nused for individual purpos-es, generally\nto aid humans\nachieve their\ngoals. However,\nthe most interesting part of AI concerns computers which\nthink by themselves and\ncreate their own goals.\nThese machines are said\nto show true artificial in-telligence, which resembles\nthe intelligence of hu-mans. These machines\nwould show capabilities including problem\nsolving, rationality\nand learning.\nAnother\narea in which they may have talent in is\nin creativity. If computers could be developed possessing such abilities, the\nfuture could be a different place. Such\nan event might lead to computers being considered conscious and possibly\neven living beings.\nA future where computers are alive\nand participating members of society\nis an idea that strikes fear into the\nhearts of many. But would\nit be such a bad thing?\nWith robots and computing systems\nthat advanced, the productive potential of the world would increase by a\ngreat magnitude. With robot workers\nbeing tireless and able to work for long\nperiods without rest and without pay,\nproduction would become more ef-ficient, leading to cheaper prices for\nconsumers as a wider stock of goods\nto choose from. Also, if robots were\nchosen for menial and dangerous jobs\n(such as cleaning or quarrying), people who would have worked in poor\nconditions or little pay would be free\nto search for more\nrewarding and\nfulfilling\ncareers.\nNot to\nmention\nthat\nfewer mistakes would be made, leading\nto a safer world and less train delays.\nOn the other hand, would the future be as rosy as some paint it? What\nwould happen if they replaced humans\nin all jobs? We might lose all of our\nspecialised craft skills (e.g. masonry,\nthatching), our music and our art,\nfundamental parts of human culture.\nIt would be interesting to see how we\nwould function as a society, if people\nhave no careers in the future would\nthere be a communist economy, with\nno difference in wealth and circum-stances? Would society be happy that\nway, or will there always be people who\nstrive to differentiate themselves from\nthe masses. Would people even bother\nto provide an education for their chil-dren, if machines could do everything\nanyway?\nIf that happened, a disaster may occur if the machines broke down and\ncould not be fixed by other ma-chines. It could even lead to a dark\nage, with humans having to learn from\nscratch. Or has this already\nhappened?\nAn even\nmore\nworrying\nproblem might occur if the computers of the future develop emotions and\npersonalities. Would they be content\nto do all that we ask them? If these\ncomputers will be able to create their\nown goals and solve problems, would\nthere be a stage where they decide that\ntheir goal differs from the general goal\nof humanity, which is to advance ourselves in terms of knowledge, creativity\nand society? What would happen if this\nnew goal required the disappearance\nof humans? Would we be able to fight\nof this new enemy, who aim to destroy\nus using our weapons and unbeatable\nstrategies?\nMany academics are split of the likelihood of a machine conscious, an argument which has spanned over many\ndecades. It can be simplified into an\nargument between two sides, between\ndualists and materialists.\nThe dualist philosophy is a belief that\nthought and conscience are products\nof a nonphysical substance, while the\nmaterialist philosophy holds the belief\nthat all mental actions can be explained\nby interactions between physical matter (i.e. chemicals). Dualists argue that\nas long as intelligence is established\nby a nonphysical substance, man cannot create artificial intelligence in machines in any manner. Materialists oppose this by saying that is the mind is\nmade of purely physical matter, then it\nis possible to create an artificial intelligence in machines that approximates\nhuman intelligence.\nBut how do we know when a machine has reached a suitable level of\ncognisance to be seen as truly intelli-gent? Well, there have been a few tests\nproposed to answer this question, the\nmost notable being a test devised by\nthe father of modern computer sci-ence, Alan Turing. The Turing test\ndetermines a computer to be intelligent if a human judge cannot between\na computer and a human in separate\none-on-one conversations. Both conversations would be carried out in text,\nto make each participant anonymous.\nBut this is a theoretical test which has\nits criticisms.\nAt the end of the day, we can only\nspeculate about the contents of the future as (thankfully) we haven \u00edt quite\nreached a stage where these things are\npossible yet. Our computers are only as\ngood as the code that instructs them.\nOr are they\u00d601010?\n\u201cWould people\neven bother\nto provide an\neducation for\ntheir children if\nmachines could\ndo everything?\u201d\nPicture of the Week\nSlapton Sands, by Alastair Isaacs\n2nd Year Physics\nWe want to exhibit your art.

They\u2019d looked weak at regionals,\nand with a depleted team looked even\nmoreso in Manchester. dD won comfortably without any hitches.\nvs Fish (Lancaster): 10-5\nWe weren\u2019t sure what to expect having never played Fish before. They\nwere top of the pool, so we expected\na tough match. We knew that if we\nwon, we would overtake them, so we\nstarted strong and maintained our\nlead throughout. We used our zone-D\nto great effect, forcing turnovers and\noutmatching them on O. We were now\nguaranteed a top 8 finish.\nvs BUF (Oxford Brookes): 6-5\nWinning this match meant a guaranteed top 4 finish. Last year BUF\nbeat us soundly and went on to win\nthe tournament, so we expected a\ngruelling contest. We were really up\nfor this game, and while everyone got\npsyched, I resorted to getting high on\nrandom energy gel. dD took a 4-1 lead\nthrough some massive grabs and sexy\noffense against their zone-D, but they\ndug deep and caught up, but for every\nhard-fought point they scored, we responded quickly and we finished 1\npoint ahead.\nSATURDAY NIGHT\nWe planned to go for dinner followed\nby SingStar at one of the hosts\u2019 houses\nbefore the traditional Saturday night\nparty. However, \u201cwe weren\u2019t allowed\nto\u201d, as the host who had SingStar was\nhost to BUF. It seemed they harboured\nsome resentment and were adamant\nabout not wanting to hang out with\ndD.\nWe headed to a nearby pub for food\nand some chilling, and then headed to\ntechno-club Baa-Bar. Finnish immediately took to wooing the ladies with\nhis trademark dance moves, but erred\nwhen he attempted a dance-off with a\nbreakdancer. Despite Finnish\u2019s usual\ntractor-like pull with the ladies, Pyro\nwasn\u2019t about to let that happen in his\nbackyard (the north) and swept our\nhost off her feet. As always, dD were\nthe \u2018ultimate\u2019 party animals, and partied till closing. Aside from a couple\nBath players, all the other teams had\ngone home.\nSUNDAY\nWe were fortunate to start at noon;\nnecessary to sleep off the alcohol from\nthe night before. Also, to sleep off some\nlate-night terrorizing from Chichester, who\u2019d stayed in the same house,\nwhich included the licking of sleeping\nMythago Jon\u2019s face and the stacking\nof clothes, pots and pans on top of a\nsleeping Rosie.\nvs Dark Horses (Strathclyde): 5-11\nHorses were the eventual tournament winners, so there was no shame\nin losing. I think we were feeling the\naftermath of the night before, and\nsome wobbly throws and shaky hands\nsaw Horses quickly take the lead. The\nmatch was much tighter than the score\nindicates, but ultimately, they were\nthe better team. They broke down our\nzone-D, and some clinical offense and\ntight D saw them leading throughout.\nvs DUF (Durham): 5-4\nOur final match for a podium finish (3rd vs. 4th). We were all up for\nthis one and it showed. We fell behind\n0-2 but pulled together, showed some\nheart and fought back. I recall some of\nthe biggest grabs of the weekend, and\nsome of the hardest man-D I\u2019ve seen,\nand played, in ages. This game went to\nthe wire; a perfect way to end an epic\ntournament.\nAnd so dD finished 3rd at Nationals\nDivision 2. For consecutive years, we\nwere the only South-East team to finish in the top half.\nMagnet was MVP for his solid O &\nD, and ridiculous aerial superiority.\nThat being said, everyone else played\nincredibly too. We played our hardest,\nand most importantly, as a team. We\nwere spirited and intense, exactly how\na university team should be. We did so\nwell and we can all be proud of how we\nplayed.\nOutdoor regionals are fast-approach-ing, so watch this space\u2026\nWith goalkeeper Cotton-Eye-Joe unavailable due to a viva (quite important\napparently) what were the DeIViants\nto do? No magic stick, no pink slipper\n\u2013 not good. Dirty Sheets deputised in\ngoal - the name didn\u2019t bode well but\nthose in-the-know knew otherwise.\nCaptain Mr Pacman tried to make\nthings worse by producing directions\nto a pitch in Surbiton, which ended on\na road in Clapham. Nonetheless the\nDeIViants made it there, early: things\nwere looking up!\nThe DeIViants controlled the first\nhalf thanks in great part to Fourplay,\nMr Pacman and Santa\u2019s Little Helper\u2019s\ndominance in central midfield. After\nten minutes a slick interplay in attack between Tracy and Quickie led\nHockey\nImperial Men\u2019s 4th XI 4\nSt George\u2019s Men\u2019s 2nd XI 0\nFeatherlite\nto Quickie\u2019s shot being saved only for\nFreedom Pass to steam in and tuck\naway the rebound for his first DeIViant\ngoal: 1-0. IC kept piling on the pressure\nwith Premature Withdrawal and Free\nWilly stretching the George\u2019s defence\nwith searching runs down the wings.\nTracy hit his first of three posts with\nan ambitious reverse-stick shot. Defensively the DeIViants looked solid.\nEasy Access, Stubble Rash and Oedipus were marking the George\u2019s attack\nout of the game leaving Featherlite free\nto roam and bawl his head off. George\u2019s\nonly real chance came when Oedipus\nforgot which direction he was playing\nand put their striker clean through.\nThe crisis was averted by an excellent\nsliding save by Dirty Sheets and Featherlite frantically clearing the follow-up.\nOrder was restored soon after when\nTracy contrived not to hit the post and\nput the DeIViants 2-0 up at half time.\nGeorge\u2019s came out fired up for the\nsecond half. Mr Pacman calmly slotting home a short corner two minutes\nin to make it 3-0 but IC were still under the cosh and soaking up George\u2019s\npressure.\nCurb Crawler and Sticky Situation\nwere both frustrating the George\u2019s attack with some excellent interventions\nand Oedipus, now seemingly happy\nwith the direction we were playing,\nwas a central defensive wall. Excellent\ncontrolling central midfield play from\nFourplay, Mr Pacman and Quickie, as\nwell as some impressive growling from\nSanta\u2019s Little Helper and some frankly\nwild diving from Freedom Pass, turned\nthe tables and the final quarter of the\ngame was all IC.\nRandom Fresher no. 6 created some\ngood chances and came close, Tracy\ncontinued to try to break the goal\nframe and Quickie was a whisker away\nfrom a well-worked short corner.\nFinally, Mr Pacman made it 4-0 and\nput the game beyond doubt with another almost lackadaisical but accurate\nshort corner. At the final whistle, the\nDeIViants maintained their unbeaten record on the road and soon after\nlearnt Cotton-Eye-Joe was now Dr\nCotton-Eye-Joe to round off an excellent afternoon.\nMatt Tow\nHockey\nMen\u2019s 2s ULU vs King\u2019s College Medicals 2s ULU\nMen\u2019s 3rd vs University of Reading 4th\nWomen\u2019s 1st vs University of Reading 1st\nLacrosse\nMen\u2019s 1st vs Canterbury Christ Church Uni 1st\nWomen\u2019s 1st vs Royal Holloway 1st\nRugby\nBUCS Cup\nMen\u2019s 2nd vs Kingston University 1st\nMen\u2019s 1st vs Oxford Brookes University 1st\nMen\u2019s 3rd vs Imperial Medicals 3rd\nSquash\nMen\u2019s 1st vs University of Surrey 1st\nWomen\u2019s 1st vs LSE 1st\nTable Tennis\nMen\u2019s 1st vs Brunel University 1st\nTennis\nMen\u2019s 1st vs University of Reading 1st\nWomen\u2019s 1st vs Brunel University 1st\nVolleyball\nMen\u2019s 1st vs University of Essex 1st\nA member of dD imposing some impressive zone-D on the opposition\nThe disc Doctors prepare for \u2018throw off\u2019 in the Nationals in their loud but intimidating kit.\nThe DeIViants are in high spirits after their well deserved and hard earned victory against St George\u2019s\nSolution 1,417\n\n"

    "content": "4 felix Friday 5 December 2008\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNews\nRoaming Rabbi at IC\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nSeveral complaints have been raised\nover the recent actions of a Jewish\nRabbi on the Imperial College campus.\nRabbi Mendy Loewenthal has been\nseen in and around campus attempting\nto inform the Jewish students about\nthe Chabad organization.\nChabad, who are an outreach branch\nof the Jewish faith that provides opportunities for Jews to become more ob-servant, as well as shelter and kosher\nfood for travelling Jews. Their website\ndescribes the Chabad of South Kensington as a \u2018place where university\nstudents come to connect to their Judaism. It offers students the opportunity\nto learn and discover the richness of\ntheir Jewish heritage with group study,\none on one learning, organized trips,\nShabbat and holiday celebrations.\u2019\nNeither Imperial College Union\n[ICU] nor Imperial College [IC] have\na problem with the presence of the\nRabbi in the area. They are concerned,\nhowever, with his actions around cam-pus. Several posters have been appearing across the campus advertising the\nChabad centre using the Imperial College Union logo, thus indicating that\nthere might be an affiliation with ICU.\nJenny Morgan, ICU President, made\nit very clear that he has \u201cno affiliation\nwith Imperial College or the Union\u201d.\nImperial College do have a Chaplaincy\nCentre, which is open for students of\nall faiths to go and explore different\nfaiths and beliefs, ask questions about\nidentity and meaning and to engage\nwith contemporary issues.\nRabbi Loewenthal has also been calling himself the Rabbi for Imperial College, which is incorrect, as the actual\nRabbi for London students is Rabbi\nGavin Broder. Rabbi Broder has been\nheavily involved with campus activities\nthis year, including assisting at the ICU\nFreshers\u2019 Fair and wandering around\nRabbi Mendy and Sara Loewenthal operate on an open door policy,\nregardless of affiliations, backgrounds, and religious observance\ncampus in an attempt to contact the\nJewish community at Imperial.\nOne student told felix that they have\nfelt \u2018harassed\u2019 by Rabbi Lowenthal,\nwho persistently sent them e-mails and\nflyers in an unsolicited manner. He has\nalso attempted to add a number of students as friends on facebook, and has\nadded Imperial addresses to his mailing list without consent of the students\nin question.\nYoni Weiner, President of Imperial\nCollege Jewish Society, told felix that\n\u201cthere has been a mixed response from\nthe Jewish students, some students\nhave welcomed another person organising additional educational and social\nevents for Jewish students but other\nstudents feel that considering the small\nnumber of Jews at Imperial it is not\nnecessary to have another organisation\ncompeting with the Imperial College\nJewish Society which already provides\neducational and social activities for\nJews at Imperial and are weary that\nChabad have a hidden agenda.\u201d\nRecently, Chabad were in international news when Rabbi Gavriel and\nRivkah Holtzberg, a couple running a\nChabad house in Mumbai, were killed\nduring the recent tragic events that occurred there.\nIC Big Band perform their music at the competition\nImperial College Big Band\nwin Gold Award\nJohn Prestage &\nMarc Hinken\nSunday 30th November saw the Imperial College Big Band take a trip to\nColchester to take part in the regional\nheat for the National Concert Band\nFestival.

However the biggest stockpilers of the weapon, the US, Russia and China will not be signing,\narguing that cluster bombs have legitimate military uses such as repelling\nadvancing troop columns.\nConcerted pressure to ban the weapon came from campaign groups around\nthe world, and the movement gathered momentum after the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war where cluster bombs were deployed. Supporters of the treaty hope\nit will stigmatise the use of cluster bombs, just as landmines were stigmatised\nby the 1999 Ottawa Treaty, which will shame the big arms producers to sign\nthe cluster bomb treaty at a later date.\nNorway: Treaty to ban cluster bombs\nsigned\nIraq: \u2018Chemical Ali\u2019 convicted\nSaddam Hussein\u2019s cousin, Ali Hassan Al-Majid who is known as \u201cChemical\nAli\u201d, has been convicted of crimes against humanity by the Iraqi High Tribunal and sentenced to death for a second time.

Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n15\nFriday 5 December 2008 felix\nMTSoc \u2018Don\u2019t tell Mama\u2019\n14 felix Friday 5 December 2008\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Arts\nI\n\u2019m trapped in a room full of\ndancing and prancing in the\nHuxley building, with the aim of\npresenting my faithful readers\nwith a cheeky sneaky preview\nof the Musical Theatre Society\u2019s imminent production \u2018Don\u2019t Tell Mama\u2019. I\u2019m\ntreated to a full run-through, but first\nI am forced to sit through their warm-up exercises, which are terrifying. It\u2019s\na bit like watching a primary school\nPE lesson. I get somebody\u2019s arse in my\nface a couple of times, but I try not to\ntake it personally. My initial impressions of MTSoc is that there\u2019s more of\nthem than I expected, they seem to really enjoy what they do, and they sing\nunbelievably loudly. In this tiny little\nroom it\u2019s almost deafening \u2013 and yet\nduring their actual performances they\nuse microphones.\nThe first song is \u2018Good morning Baltimore\u2019 from Hairspray. It\u2019s a catchy\nsong and difficult to fault. I did feel\nthat at times the performers are fighting to out-sing each other, particularly\nthe more confident ones, so it often\nreached ear-splitting levels. It\u2019s hard\nto tell whether that will do better or\nworse on stage.\nThe next song is a solo: \u2018Taylor the\nLatte Boy\u2019, sung by Katie Clemence. It\u2019s\nan amusing, witty little ditty. Clemence\nis very good, with a sweet voice suited\nto the role perfectly, though she was\na little quiet. This is one of the songs\nI\u2019ll look forward to revisiting on the\nnight. At this point I had to ask \u201cerm...\nis this supposed to have a storyline?\u201d.\nThe answer was no. It\u2019s a cabaret thing.\nWhich is fair enough, but I hope they\nmake this a bit clearer in the performance or otherwise the audience will be\nleft bewildered.\n\u2018I Can Make You a Man\u2019, of Rocky\nHorror fame, is more MTSoc\u2019s usual\ncamp comedy style. It\u2019s a hysterical\nnumber, bound to be an early show-stopper. \u2018Don\u2019t Tell Mama\u2019, the show\u2019s\ntitle song, is another funny one. The\nchoreography is top class stuff, but\nthe female company is sloppy. To their\ncredit, the directors knew this and told\nthem so. If they can pull it together\nduring the week it will be amazing.\nThe duet \u2018I am Adolpho\u2019 is another\ncomic number, and is very amusing.\nBarry Whiteside and Elizabeth Fritsch\nare both very talented, but have a quiet\nconfidence that really makes it succeed.\nWhiteside, in particular, truly comes\nalive on the stage. \u2018Snooky Ookums\u2019 is\nanother duet, but is a charmingly funny\nsong that doesn\u2019t need the hammed-up slapstick prevalent in the rest of the\nshow... Like \u2018Afternoon Delight\u2019. Yes,\nthe song about afternoon love-making\nfrom Anchorman. MTSoc\u2019s rendition\nof this ticks all the raunchy gay clich\u00e9\nboxes. It will make every straight man\nin the audience want to run for the\nnearest emergency exit. I can hardly\nbelieve they have the guts to do this\nsort of thing \u2013 it\u2019s utterly astounding.\nI enjoyed it, though others might find\nit a step too far.\nMatt Stringer has a subtle but pleasant voice and does a respectable job of\n\u2018If I Didn\u2019t Believe in You\u2019. It\u2019s difficult\nfor a show to swing from homoerotic\npiss-taking to something more serious,\nso this song could end up underappre-ciated. We\u2019re back on to the sex again\nin \u2018Toucha Toucha Touch Me\u2019, another\nRocky Horror. \u201cThere\u2019s no use in heavy\npetting, it only leads to trouble and\nseat-wetting\u201d. Hum. Laura McCaughey\nis very good but risks being smothered\nby a loud female chorus. If she can be\nlouder and less delicate this could end\nup being the best song in the show.\n\u2018Sarah Brown Eyes\u2019 is a beautifully\nromantic song. I don\u2019t get to see the\nfemale part done by the real person, so\nI can\u2019t comment on that, but Phil Raymond nailed the male part perfectly\nso I\u2019ve got high hopes. For the record,\nLucy Harrold was an excellent stand-in and did a thoroughly believable job\nof it. We\u2019re getting towards the end of\nthe production now, with everybody\ncoming together for some finale ac-tion. There were some voices in \u2018Being Alive\u2019 that I would have liked to\nhave heard more of in their own songs.\nPerhaps these hidden talents will be\nrevealed in the next production? The\nwhole company comes together nicely\nwith some beautiful harmonies, bar the\noccasional high note making me wince.\nThe final song is \u2018Fame\u2019. Now, in their\nfavour, the whole lot of them clearly\nEmily Wilson previews the Musical Theatre Society\u2019s newest production \u2018Don\u2019t Tell Mama\u2019\nadore this finale. It\u2019s full of passion and\nexcitement, with fun and funky choreography that would be beyond most of\nus, coming together in a grand climax.\nBut why \u2018Fame\u2019? It\u2019s such a cliched and\npredictable finale! I felt bad for disliking it, and I wish they\u2019d come up with\nsomething equally impressive but a bit\nmore original.\nOf course, I was watching a rehearsal.\nWhat I saw was riddled with mistakes\nand inappropriate giggles, out of costume and away from the stage. A lot of\npeople with solos weren\u2019t there. All in\nall, I certainly didn\u2019t get the full effect.\nBut on the other hand it was fascinating to watch MTSoc interact with each\nother, and to see all the hard work that\ngoes on putting on these shows. I was in\nawe of some of the musical talent that\ncomes out of a university of science\nand technology. In my opinion they all\ndeserve a major pat on the back.\nHaving seen many of their past per-formances, I also think this one ranks\nquite highly, so MTSoc should regard\nit as a triumph. But should I recommend it to you? Many of you, I\u2019m sure,\nare already set in your hatred of what is\nregarded as a lower art form. It\u2019s crass\nand immature, and entertains with its\nsexual innuendo, fluffy gayness and\ncheery tunes.\nMTSoc\u2019s production conforms to all\nthe usual musical theatre stereotypes,\nso if that\u2019s something you despise\nthen don\u2019t expect to have your mind\nchanged. However, \u2018Don\u2019t Tell Mama\u2019 is\na perky little production that makes for\nan uplifting night out, so is a must for\npre-existing musical fans or anybody\nin need of some light entertainment.\n\u201cHaving seen\nmany of their\nperformances,\nthis one ranks\nquite highly\u201d\nThe company on stage during their recent performance of \u2018Don\u2019t Tell Mama\u2019\nThe cast at one of the photo shoots for the performance\nDramSoc\u2019s Merry\nPersons steal the\nopening night\nJonathan Dakin reviews the opening night performance of\nDramSocs\u2019s Robin Hood\nT\nhis year\u2019s Christmas pantomime from Imperial\u2019s\nDrama Society is Robin\nHood, but don\u2019t expect\nstrong men running\naround saving the poor and fighting\nthe bad guys: this is a rather different\nstory.\nThe play begins with a weak and\nscatterbrained King John talking to\nhis Freudian psychiatrist about how\nbad things have been for him lately. It\nseems that everyone has been hit by a\nmoney crisis (mirroring contemporary\ntimes), including royalty. In turn, we\nthen meet all of the unusual characters:\nan alcoholic and arrogant Sheriff of\nNottingham, a stupid and ditzy Robin,\na sexist and short tempered Friar Tuck,\nan angry and hot-headed Wil(helmina)\nScarlet, and a spoilt and self-centred\nMarian. It seems that everyone is out\nfor themselves: the Sheriff forces Marian to woe Robin in order to make him\nsteal from the rich for her, but instead\nof giving the money to her evil Abbot\nuncle and the Sheriff, she plans to run\naway to Paris with her long-suffering\nmaid Sizeable Joanna, taking all of the\ngoods. Although this is a very different take on an overused idea, lets not\nforget that this is a Pantomime, and\nso good should triumph over evil\u2026 or\nwill it? It is hard to tell how it will end,\nespecially when every single character\nhas questionable ulterior motives.\nRobin Hood has some funny mo-ments, including a sexual encounter\nbetween Little John and Sizeable Joanna and a fight between Kung Fu Fighters, a band of Pirates and a group of\nMonks. It is also interesting to see that\nit is actually Little John and Wilhelmina Scarlet who are running things,\nnot Robin Hood, who thinks that he is\nthe one in control when everyone else\nknows he isn\u2019t.\nThere are also some good performances from a few of the cast. Lakshmi Sreenivasan who plays Brudo,\na sword-wielding midget, gets most\nof the laughs, mainly because of her\nshort-statured caricature, and Shamini\nBundell, who plays Maid Marian, does\nwell to convince the audience that a\nspoilt selfish woman can change for\nthe better. The Ensemble are also good\nat being funny, although sometimes\nnot intentionally. It is a shame that the\ncast mainly played their roles seriously,\nthey almost seemed to forget that this\nis a Pantomime, and that their characters should be over the top and played\nfor laughs. It could be first night nerves\nthat got to them, but I would have liked\nto see a bit more energy and I am sure\nthat if they all relax and take it less seri-ously, then a lot more humour would\ncome through.\nBut saying that, it is not easy to do\nPanto, especially when much of it depends on audience participation, and\nthe fact that they are all amateur ac-tors. They made a good attempt at a\nhard task, and even when the audience\nheckled them, the cast seemed unfazed\nand used it to their advantage.\nThe real highlight of the night was\nthe audience, who were all very involved in the play, and enjoyed playing\nalong to the Panto elements e.g. \u2018He\u2019s\nbehind you!\u2019 If you went with a group\nof your friends, looking to have a fun\nand humorous time, then I would say\nthat as long as you, your mates and the\nrest of the audience are willing to get\ninvolved, you will have a good laugh.\n\u201cThey make a\ngood attempt\nat a hard task,\nand even when\nheckled, they\nused it to their\nadvantage\u201d\nPrince John and a merry person, no euphemism intended\nCome and see the show tonight or tomorrow night in the Union Concert Hall\n\n"

Even students, I guess,\ncan be affected by worsening job pros-pects. If it\u2019s less likely you\u2019ll find a job\nafter graduation you might feel it safer\nnot to expand your student loan by\nmore than necessary (well fine, \u2018necessary\u2019 is a flexible concept). Such thrift\nis not bad by itself, at all. It\u2019s entirely\nrational. Yet unfortunately greater saving also has the side effect of reducing\nconsumption \u2013 as income is equal to\nsaving plus spending. And a fall in consumer spending will mean less revenue\nfor companies.\nSo what? Who cares if Marks &\nSpencer, BT and Currys make a little\n(or a lot) less money? Obviously those\nholding shares in such companies will\ncare. But even for the rest of us, there\nare good reasons why it is far from ir-relevant. A fall in revenue and demand\nfor companies\u2019 products means that\nthey are pushed to cut production and\nreduce expenses. This might be done\nby closing some factories, shops and\noffices, or by reducing their payroll e.g.\nby laying people off, employing fewer\ntemporary staff, and putting even in-flation-matching pay rises on ice. Thus\naverage income decreases. While a\ngreater proportion of people\u2019s income\nis being saved, this is effectively more\nof less. Hence, despite a higher savings\nrate, total savings may rise by less, remain constant, or even fall \u2013 a possibility termed the \u201cParadox of Thrift\u201d by\nthe influential British economist John\nMaynard Keynes.\nDoes this imply that thrift is actually a bad thing? From the individual\u2019s\npoint of view it\u2019s perfectly sensible,\nbut for society as a whole there is a\ncost to everyone spending less, namely\nreduced income. It may be thrown in\nthat, surely, this is not in anyone\u2019s interest and hence individuals should\nwant to keep spending in order to sustain their salary. Yet it is worth considering that while a person bears the full\ncost of his own spending, the benefit in\nterms of increased revenue and income\nis distributed amongst a huge number\nof people (a phenomenon known as a\n\u201cpositive externality\u201d to economists).\nHence the positive effect of his spending on his own income is minute, and\nnot a reason for abandoning thrift.\nA case like this, where the rational action of the individual has negative consequences for society as a whole, can\nbe conceptualised into the \u201cProblem\nof Suboptimisation\u201d (equally, it could\nbe understood in terms of the related\nconcepts of the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma or\nthe Tragedy of the Commons). This\ndescribes a situation where optimising\nthe outcome for a subsystem (an indi-vidual) does not optimise the outcome\nfor the system as a whole (society).\nHow do we get around this problem\nand ensure demand \u2013 and ultimately\nincome \u2013 doesn\u2019t crash?\nAs it is society that reaps the wider\nincome benefits of avoiding a demand\ncrash, it should also be prepared to\ntake on the costs \u2013 no smaller subsystem will. Arguably, any such collective\naction can only be taken by our repre-sentation, the government. It will need\nto spend now and repay its debts once\nthe economy is more stable again. If\nthe decision is taken to spend (future)\npublic money, we would certainly like\nit to be done in a manner that maxim-ises the effect on demand and benefits\nas many people for as long as possible.\nHow do we best achieve this? Should\nthe government just give everyone\nmoney, for instance by cutting income taxes? Or is the money better\nspent directly on public services and\ninfrastructure? Handing out money to\nhouseholds would have the beneficial\neffect that they can spend it on what\nthey want, and it would be quick to\nshow effects. The problem with this\nis that if people feel like saving more,\nthey will also save a large part of the\nmoney given to them \u2013 which is great\nfor them personally, but fails to address our systemic concern with maintaining demand. The alternative, to\nraise government expenditure directly,\nensures that it really is spent and not\nsaved. Yet there are drawbacks, too, as\nbig government projects are likely to\ntake some time to get going \u2013 a delay\nthat could leave the economy vulnerable to a short-term slump with permanent consequences. Furthermore,\ncentral decisions are often assumed to\nbe more wasteful than those taken by\nparticipants of the market.\nEvidently, both stimulus approaches have their shortcomings. Hence a\nmixture of the two is probably best:\nsome tax cuts for immediate effect and\npublic sector expenditure to ensure as\nmuch as possible actually reaches the\neconomy. The recent VAT reduction\nseems favourable to simply lowering\nincome taxes, since it directly incen-tivises consumption, making it less\nlikely to get stashed away in personal\nsavings. It also has a broader effect,\ngiving everyone more spending power,\nincluding those who don\u2019t pay income\ntax \u2013 such as pensioners and those on\nbenefits (and students, incidentally,\n*wink, wink*). Money spent directly by\nthe government should benefit more\nthan just the immediate providers of\nthe services. Without going into much\ndetail here, education, public trans-port, healthcare, energy efficiency and\ninfrastructure are just a few examples\noffering sustainable long-term benefits\nto society. Not all of it needs to be new\nexpenditure either, but simply planned\nfuture investment brought forward by\na few years.\nThe Bank of England is already doing its bit by lowering interest rates,\nand the VAT rate but the situation\nalso calls for expansive fiscal measures\n(lower taxes, higher government ex-penditure). Yes, this is a lot to ask from\na taxpayer who might feel that the current economic woes are the result of\nother people\u2019s reckless behaviour. Yet\nas I have tried to argue, it is the lesser\nof two evils, where the benefit of action\noutweighs the cost of inaction.\n\u201cfor society as a\nwhole there is a\ncost to everyone\nspending less\u201d\nOne of the fundamentals of economics\nis the idea that everything has a value.\nEverything from the air you breathe\nto the food you eat to the clothes you\nwear. The trees, the birds, the seas, the\nclouds, the houses, the ground, all of\nit has a price. Even people. Especially\npeople. For economists, people are the\nmost interesting things to value in the\nwhole wide world.\nHow much is your life worth? Take a\nguess. Seriously, guess. What did you\ngo for? Thousands? Tens of thousands?\nHundreds of thousands? Keep that figure in your mind.\nObliviously (as you\u2019ve figured out)\nthe value of a person depends on the\nperson in question and what the value\u2019s\ngoing to be used for. Clearly someone who can read is worth more than\nsomeone who can\u2019t, your average child\nis worth more than your average 90\nyear old, and obviously someone with a\nskill is worth more than someone with\nThe dollar value of a human life\nnone. So how can we work out the value of a human life? Well, the majority of\neconomists argue that we should look\nat wages, evaluations by healthcare ex-perts, potential earnings and the like,\nbut frankly that\u2019s too much effort and\nis too indirect. Instead you\u2019re better off\njust looking at how much people actually sell for on the open market.\nThere are about 27 million slaves in\nthe world today, but because of the underground nature of the slave trade, it\u2019s\na bit tricky to get a truly accurate figure\nof how much a person sells for. That\nsaid, lots of groups estimate that your\naverage slave costs about \u00a360 (or $90),\nwith the cheapest slaves available in\nMali, where you can get a young adult\nmale labourer about \u00a327 (or $40).\nNow, it\u2019s worth taking in to account\nthat at these prices, you\u2019re not going to\nbe able to buy premium quality slavery.\nSure, a \u00a327 slave can talk, feel, think,\nhope, dream, love, fear and whatever,\nbut they\u2019re probably incapable of doing anything really useful like reading\nor writing fluently, nor will they be\nguaranteed to be free from disease.\nHigher quality human lives are more\ncostly and their prices depend on what\nthey are needed for. For example, a\nHIV-free, young, female slave (suit-able for brothel work) can cost \u00a3669\n(or $1000).\nSo immediately we can see that being female, young, attractive or disease\nfree makes you a more valuable human\nbeing, but even so \u00a3669 is actually quite\ncheap. If we look at trade transactions\nfrom the last 150 years we can see that\nin 1860, a human male would sell for\nsomething between $450 and $1000\ndollars. Today, that\u2019s about \u00a37,725 to \u00a3\n17,170. So, one American slave in 1860\nwas worth the same amount as 461\nequivalent slaves today, or 207 average\nmodern slaves or 18.6 contemporary\nbrothel slaves.\nTo put his into even further perspec-tive, a quick search on www.epupz.\nco.uk shows that a retriever (a breed of\ndog) costs about \u00a3750 on average, 12%\nmore than a HIV-free, young, human,\nfemale.\nSo using the slave-gauge we can see\nthat not only is a basic human very\ncheap, but it has also decreased in value by about 99.679% over the last 150\nyears. Assuming that humans have decreased by a constant rate, we can the\ngo on to work out the value retention\nrate of human life to be about 0.9625\na year, giving us a human life inflation\nrate of 3.75%. Or in other words, the\nvalue of human life halves every 18\nyears.\nDepressing, isn\u2019t it? But don\u2019t worry\nso much because according to the gov-ernment, your life is worth millions\nof pounds. Yes, millions of pounds.\nThe US government puts the life of\nan American at $6.9 million. Here in\nthe UK, the government is a bit more\ndiscreet with the figures, but it\u2019s safe to\nassume that you\u2019re worth at least \u00a34m\nto her majesties civil service. To BP\nthough, a human life is worth significantly more, with the average person\nbeing worth about \u00a313.3m. But to an\ninsurance company, you\u2019re worth a lot\nless.\nWant to know why? It\u2019s not because\nyou\u2019ve got more skills than a slave.\nIt\u2019s not because you can read, write\nor whatever. It\u2019s not because you\u2019re\nhealthy. It\u2019s because unlike the people who have been kidnapped, you\u2019ve\ngot rights. The major value added to\na human life comes from our ability\nfor argue our case in courts of law and\nour societies recognition of the value\nof life. BP assesses human life so high\nbecause that\u2019s the average cost of an\nout of court settlement per person.\nThe government assesses human life at\nabout \u00a34m because that\u2019s how much it\nis willing to spend to save your life if\nyou\u2019re in danger. Insurance companies\nvalue your life based on how outraged\nyou would be with small settlements.\nWe are valuable almost purely because you were born in a western\ncountry that bestowed you with rights.\nWithout those rights, we loose the majority of our value. As far as the market\nis concerned, our lives are cheap, but\nour rights are expensive.\nLuke Dhanoa\nBusiness Editor\n\n"
