Our very own ICU Cinema is no different. This week they\nboost a fantastic line up for you to feast your eyes upon. Films that are\nbeing shown this week are 'Mickey Blue Eyes', 'Shakespeare in Love1\nand\n'Saving Private Ryan'.\nMickey Blue Eyes stars Hugh Grant, James Caan and Jeanne Tripplehorn\nin this romantic comedy about love, fine art and The Mob. Michael Felgate (Hugh Grant), an elegant, debonair Englishman who runs an auction house in New York, is head-over-heels in love for the first time in his\nlife. After only three months of dating his beautiful girlfriend Gina\n(Jeanne Tripplehorn), Michael gathers up his courage and proposes mar-ri age. But, to Michael's shock, Gina declares that, though she loves\nMichael very much, she can never marry him. Michael doesn't give up\neasily and ends up getting involved with the Mob curt e sey of Gina's father\n(James Caan).\nSaving Private Ryan is about World War II, which was a pivotal event of\nthe 20th century. It shifted the borders of the globe. It forever changed\nthose who lived through it, and shaped generations to come. It has been\ncalled \"the last Great War.\" Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is ordered\nto take his squad behind enemy lines on a dangerous mission to find and\nretrieve one man: Private James Ryan (Matt Damon). This film deals with\ndifficult issues such as sacrifice and death..\nShakespeare in Love is a brilliant comedy starring Gwyneth Paltrow and\nRalph Fienes. Set in the late 1 500's, Shakespeare has writer's block and\nis struggling to finish his latest piece of work. He needs inspiration, enter\nthe lovely Gwyneth, to help him get over the block. This movie is amazing but don't expect factual historical detail. This film boasts a fine English supporting cast with Dame Judi Dench and the guys from the Fast\nShow. A must see for everyone.\nThere has been some confusion with the prices at the cinema. You don't need to be a member to go and see the films, as all screenings are now\n\u00a33. So you now have no excuse s everyone can afford \u00a33 to see some\nof the best films ever. Go get a beer and a curry and enjoy some fantastic films this week.

These buses\ngo from the park side of the Albert Hall, So now you know how to get\nthere all you have to do is answer a question, I realise that last weeks\nquestion didn't go down too well and that IC students don't want to think\nup interesting answers they just want an excuse to surf the web. Well if\nthis is the case then here is this week's question:\nIn what film did Bill Pullman star as Lone Star?\nAnswers to film.felix@ic.ac.uk before noon on Wednesday 1 7 November.\nThe people that made the effort to enter last weeks competition and win\na pair of tickets each are:\nM Doering\nP Sharma\nM Obhrai\nC Toffis\nM Arendt\nPlease call by the Felix office to collect your tickets.\nMore Offers, Offers, Offers\nThe Odeon have yet another offer to delight you film-loving people,\nThey have introduced a booklet that allows you to buy three cinema tickets and get one free.

    "content": "10 Feedback Felix \u2022 15 November 1999\nSLIDING TO SAFETY\nThis week Kevin has been in Nottingham. While in Queen's Medical Centre; a hospital which is also the home of various biological and medical faculties, Kevin noticed that there\nwere curved black plastic doors in the corners of many of the labs. On asking as to the purpose of the doors Kevin learnt that they were escape routes - not just your standard fire exit,\nbut amazingly cool chutes, which in an emergency you could use to slide down to the ground floor and to safety.\nFREE MOVIES\nDuring his time in Nottingham, Kevin stayed in\na house with a bunch of students. Kevin was pleasantly surprised to find that his hosts had got cable TV and was able to spend a couple of evenings watching Sky Movies. Later in the week Kevin learnt that the movies were in fact\nfree, courtesy of the telecommunications company NTL. NTL> has an agreement with the University to provide a service to the campus, halls of residence, and students living elsewhere in the city. In return for being the sole\ntelecommunications provider, the University,\non behalf of the students have been able to negotiate a brilliant deal with NTL. For a monthly rental, which is comparable to that\ncharged for a BT ' phone, students get a' phone, an answering service, and cable TV.\nConnection to the college network is an extra\nwhich is also available. Kevin is watching movies, because as part of the deal there is an option to choose between free sports, or free\nmovies when you sign up. As an added bonus the service also gives free calls to all the other NTL users in the area, which un surprisingly covers pretty much all students in Nottingham. One student's comment summed up the bene fits of the system: \" We all use it loads. It costs\nus hardly anything.\" Mish\nMash\nA Mostly Harmless Column by\nKevin, a random entity who\nknows nothing about nothing\nERICSSON EXCUSES\nEricsson, the company chosen to provide communication services for IC is not going to come close to the level of excellent student or ie nt a ted service as is provided at Nottingham. A tIC the system is going to be expensive. The charges are going to be partially hidden in hall\nrents, calls will not be particularly cheep, and the network will be far from comprehensive. Excuses are already reaching Kevin. For example: IC's halls are old, some of them are about to be sold, or refurbished so it is not worth\nconnecting them apparently even Southside is not going to be in the first phase of connections. There are also supposedly difficulties at\nIC because we have got so many disparate campuses, and our students are spread out all\nover London. In Kevin's opinion all these excuses could be applied to some degree at the University of Nottingham, but there the students have been provided with a first rate service, for a very reasonable cost.\nOUCH Surely intelligent IC students do not walk into\nglass doors and bash their heads on huge steel\nstaircases. However Kevin has noticed steps\nhave been taken to make the edges of the\nstaircase in the BMS foyer more visible, a similar approach has been taken with the glass\ndoors in the Health Centre which have also been marked. Kevin can only presume that\nthese measures have been taken in response to incidents - perhaps this year the Freshers area more dopey bunch than usual. To comment or contribute:\nhttp://come.to/mishmash\nor email mishmash@ic.ac.uk\nWorn*\nOh my god! ICU's gone all political onus. Before you all get alarmed, Tony hasn't selected this\nyear'ssa bbs to sit in the \" all new\" House of Lords (we should be so lucky) ; instead I'm referring to ICU Council's decision actually to support something( well, there's a first time for everything).\nAnd what is to be the event\nwhich causes council to lose its\ncollective political virginity? Why, the NUS national demonstration against tuition fees. Of course. Hang on: tuition fees are bad, aren't they? We should be rejoicing in the streets, shouldn't we? Well, maybe yes and maybe no: let's wait and see.... Oh, sorry, I mean\" prepare and decide\". While I don't want to get into\nthe tuition fee argument, it seems that ICU suddenly does, thanks to a little prod from equal op port uni ties officer George Constantini des. And it's this sudden about-face\nthat worries me. While it's true that over the\nyears ICU Council has been reliably as dull as the proverbial dish water, it has meant that things can be discussed reasonably, and( shock) that meetings can be relatively quick and clear. TheN US, on the other hand, has been consistently stuffed full of the kind of loonies that make Red Ken look like Himmler. It is for precisely this\nreason that ICU has traditionally\nhated theN US with a passion of\nwhich Gary Glitter would be proud. The point is that Council gets\nits way, whatever it wants. Get the\n\" right\" people on, and you can force ICU to blow great big wo d ges of cash on virtually anything you like. Thus, there is\nabsolutely NO connection between certain new members of council this year, and ICU\" deciding\" to spend your money on advertising the NUS march against tuition fees. Ohno. After all, this particular horse\nbolted 1 8 months ago, so how much good is it going to be to march into London now, shouting\" here horsey horsey\"? Let's not forget that this march is being organised by the same group which helped Tony to unlock that\nvery stable door. Thinking about it, though, it's not that surprising. Doug Trainer\nwas NUS president back then : a position previously occupied by\nJack Straw, Steven Twig g, Jim Murphy and Lorna Fitz simmons. Just\nlike them, he' s using it as a stepping stone into parliament. The only difference between him and them is that they voted against\ntuition fees while students, waiting\nuntil they were in government before becoming hypocritical and two face d.I'm telling you, Trainer\nwill go far.\nAnd the moral of this story?\nWhen groups purporting to represent students start playing in the\nmurky world of politics, they soon sell their credibility for a few coins.\nThose members of ICU Council who lust after a more political\nforum should learn the lesson of\nStraw and his mates: Abandon morals, all ye who enter here.\n\n"

Virtual universities will offer students tailored learning where and when it is\nrequired, jeo pardi sing there put ation of Britain's Universities.\n\"The image of the isolated computer buff is no longer real is tic\" commented the chief executive\nof the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council, Professor John Sizer.\nOne view of the virtual university depicted large scale institutes\nlinked to a global information base. Educational institutes will\ndevelop around digital connections and a demand, rendering existing universities useless. Sixth\nform colleges are predicted to take their place. Electronic lectures (similar to those currently underway in theMed School) will put an end to the\nface to face sessions and tutorials\nwill be a combination of video conferencing and emails. Coursework will be carried out online. A number of US universities\nhave already taken the first steps\ntowards this method of teaching, West er University has15000 students at 6 4 locations and the\nSouthern Regional Electronic Campus( Similar to the Open University) runs its courses in 1 5\nstates, 1 0 0 of them conducted via the internet and television. Wall Street has shown an interest in the concept of the virtual\nuniversity, but its commercial vi ability is presently limited by regulations. Sir Alec Broers, the Vice Chancellor at Cambridge said \"unless their government allows them[ universities] to operate as\npublicly traded corporations, their\ngrowth will be limited by lack of capital and... by their inability to\ngenerate maximum performance by providing them with the opportunity to build personal wealth\nthrough stock options\". The former principal of Strathclyde University,\nSir Graham Hills was among those\nunconvinced by this newer a, asking \" What would we do with all the\nprofessors?\" In Brief\nSUMMER BALL CHAIR\nFINALLY ELECTED\nLast Tuesday's meeting of Im peri al College Union Council saw the\nelection process for this year's ICU Summer Ball Chair reach a successful conclusion. After a string of no shows and failures to find any willing candidates, two Union members eventually put their names forward, with Andy He eps the run-away winner. Mr He eps was ICU President in the\n1 9 9 7 - 9 8 academic year, and during that time he oversaw the intro-duct ion of IC's first Summer Ball. He promised to keep ticket levels\nbelow \u00a3 5 0 , and hinted that Alexandra Palace is now almost certain to house this year's Ball. We'll bring you further developments as they happen. CVC P BLOCK NEW QUALIFICATIONS The Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principles (the representative body for the leaders of all Britain's Higher Education institutions) looks set to effectively veto\nthe government's new plans for post 1 6 education, with Vice President Roderick F laud suggesting that \" it is very unlikely that we will\nrequire any of the new qualifications for entry to higher education\". If colleges and universities\nrefuse to accept the new A level\nalternatives then it is believed that\nthere will be no desire from schools or students to implement the new scheme.

    "content": "Music Felix \u2022 15 November 1999\nfrequency NA Montel Jordan\nGet It On\n(Def Jam)\nFrom the man that gave us\nThis How We Do It, this new release from Montell will\nnot surprise any of his fans. The first section comprises of some phat tunes associated with Montell. Check out the track Get It Tonight.\nThis will certainly be big in\nthe clubs. The hits just keep oncoming from Everybody\n(Get Down) to the futuristic ally sounding Can't Get\nEnough. The second half\nslows down the beat to more soulful tracks oozing sensuality. That said quite a few tracks in this section are concerned with uncertain relationships. Despite this,\nthere are some songs for a good bump and grind. Tracks worth listening to are Let's Cuddle Up and the\nvery sensual Do You? Mon tell also does a very good cover of the classic Phi!\nCollins track Against Al!\nOdds.\nThe song Once Upon A Time has a Spanish influence, to the point where the\nsecond version is in Span ish. Not bad! Overall, a very good album that should have a position in your musical collection. Or Chill, it's Will, Keepin' it\nReal and ifs Mil\nusing the skill to kill\nWhat's up IC! We're gonna run through the latest news and have a quick\nglance at the singles that are doing it, but first up I'm gonna have a serious\nmoan about the state of the UK scene.\nThe problem with the UK scene is that there are no problems with the UK scene, it's really performing at the minute. Some of the tunes that are being\nreleased are actually good enough to blow away the so-called originators\nof R&B, the Americans. The British stuff that's being released has a vibe and a gloss that is as good as anything they could bring out, but then why is\nBritish R&B still looked at in a negative way. So many people refuse to\nbelieve that Beverly Knight's album could stand on the same level as a Mary\nJ album; I'm sorry but it can. In fact the thing's got more bounce than Mary's by a good mile. So what's the problem? People are hooked up on the a belief that the phat test stuff can only come from the States... well people\nbetter recognise, UKR& B is moving up on the right side and we all better\ncome correct.\nThe Spice Girls have made breaking up the latest thing to do, following on from them and the so-called disintegration of Blackstreet, we have A not her Level. It seems that one of the boys thinks he'll do better on his own and is ready to hit the road. It's been confirmed that Wayne, the black guy, you\nknow, the one who can sing, is gonna be breaking up with his buddies and do his own thang. He's gonna finish off all his duties with Another Level with\ntheir current hit \"Bombdiggy\" before embarking on what he hopes is going\nto be a fruitful solo career. The rest of the boys gotta be hoping he fucks\nup, but somehow I doubt it, because he's already got the master don producer lined up to start work on his album... no not fucking Puff Daddy... the Darkchild Rodney Jerkins is supposedly willing to do production duties\nfor Wayne.\nAfter the Bob Marley duet with the multi-talented Miss Hill it seems one of\nthe biggest stars of rap is gonna be making his presence felt from beyond\nthe grave. Biggie's back! The man is weighing in with another post death\nalbum. Like Tupac it seems that there is no limit to the records that can be\npulled out of the bag, not that that's a bad thing. In the past, I 've gone on about the number on guests that turn up on people's albums, well the new\nBiggie album, \"Born Again\", has got more big name stars than the Hollyw ood. Puff Daddy, Li!1\nKim,2 Pac, Busta Rhymes, Snoop Dogg, Mob b Deep, Eminem, Method Man, Redman, Missy 'Misdemeanor' Elliot, Ice Cube, DJ\nPremier, Clark Kent and anyone else you can think of, they're all there. The\nfirst single \"Dead Wrong\" has already been doing the rounds on import.\nMilen\nI IS1 Will Smith\n(Columbia)\nThe man in black is back with this ego maniac ally titled new album. This follow up to Big\nWillie Style is a collection of funk and80' s groove-inspired tunes that are guaranteed to\npack the dance floor (though not all the\ntracks can do this). One thing that comes dear is the definite old skool flav a to the\nwhole album. Tracks on this album feature\nquite a few guys: K Ci, Lit1\nKim, Slick Rick,\nKool MoDe e, Dru Hill, his wife Jada Pinkett\nSmith and even the first lady of the ruff\nryder s, Eve. Jazzie Jeff is back with the\nscratching he is able to do well. (Half of track\n8 is Jazzie ripping it up with some dope scratching).\nThe first couple of tracks are your party jams\n(the ones meant to pack the floor). From the\nfirst single Will 2K currently on general\nrelease now with a slamming video, to the\nLatino La Fiesta (everyone is going Spanish),\nthese songs will keep you moving to the beat.\nAfro Angel slows things down just a little with\nJada laying down some spoken word. The\nreal ' old skool' tracks are next, casting your\nmind back in time to when Slick Rick and Biz\nMarkie were at the top of the game. An interesting track on this album is Potnas where Mr Smith experiments with DMX of the ruff\nryder s' flow. He does okay but he should stick\nto what he has 'perfected1. Overall, Willennium is average, without as\nmany jams as Big Willie Style but an OK album with a variety of tracks using different\nstyles. The main grumble is that some would argue Will's flow as being too commercial and downright whack. That may be true but\nyou can't stop this guy stacking chips with his\nflow so don't playa hate.\nin O "

    "content": "15 November 1999 \u2022 Felix Music\nfrequency N/\\ Mere\nMere\nICJ\nIt's the voice. Unique, instinct u al, lively, but most of all it's fear-less. Mer z( Conrad Lambert)\nhas a wonderful array of tunes,\nbut instead of messing them\naround in order to make it\ninteresting, they're innovative ly embellished to gorgeous effect.\nThis means you're going to\nhear a bunch of things you\ndon't always get from your\nusual pop album. Lotus begins\nwith a brass band picking out a lonely tune, before computerised breakbeat s pick up the\ntempo, followed by that voice.\nThe gospel choir in CC Conscious gives way to chunky per-cus sion, squelch y bass and a keening vocal. Although these\nare seemingly disparate and contrasting elements, every\nsong sounds incredibly co he sive.\nThis album sounds so original\nand alive. Music has recently\nbeen finding new and exciting\nways to diversify and merge, but never to such joyful extent\nas it does here. Everything from techno, drum 'n' bass, folk, jazz,\nelectro, indie... (the list could go on forever) is absorbed and fearlessly implemented to create something unique. But best\nof all, the tunes are good. Not just good, fantastic. Indeed,\nthere's a whole new world out\nthere. Let Mer z into your life.\nRage Against The Machine\nThe Battle of LA.\n(Epic)\nR AAAAAA AAAAAA GE! Somehow, these boys are still angry after\nthree albums. Which makes me happy as it would have been ali too easy for Rage to sell out - become all post rock and nonabrasive. But they still rock.\nIf you didn't like Rage before, this album won'ten dear them to you in\nany special new way. But if, like me, you loved to listen to a band with\na bit of integrity rather than the usual money grabbing lay about s then\nthis will be right up your street. The track listing says it all really -Calm As Bomb, Voice Of The Voiceless, Born As Ghosts and Broken\nMan being some of the more mellow titles. But it really isn't about the\ntitles, it's all about the depth of real emotion that goes into these\nsongs the way they smack you in the face and make you think while\ngetting you mosh in ground the room as well. I defy anyone to listen\nto Sleep Now In The Fire on full volume and not end up bouncing off\nthe walls.\nThe reason they are still the same after all these years is that the systems that they were originally protesting against still exists. Further, as\nfar as Rage are concerned, in many cases these systems have become even more extreme and unjust. We should be ali this angry.\nBut this isn'ta political forum, soon with the critique. After listening\nto this album a couple of times, most US( and US influenced) rock\nbands sounded hopelessly weedy and apathetic. I suppose not every-one wants to be made to think while rocking out, but I think it's very\nrefreshing to hear it - even if you don't subscribe to their stance.\nThe same rock/ funk/ industrial/ rap style is very much in evidence, and there's some sparks of reggae( yes, that's reggae), electronica( as the yanks would term it) and even folk y flavours too. Of course there's still plenty of grunting and wailing. As voices go, Zack de la\nRocha's certainly has a lot of feeling. While he rarely ' sings', I don't think that many people at Rage gigs fail to understand the emotions involved in his rap/rant style of orating. I think the world would be a better place with a few more bands like\nRage Against the Machine. A few more that question the society that\nthey are in - rather than singing about how fine Micky is, or that they\nare going to blame everything on the weatherman. More of the same but when it's this great, who cares?\nCat Stevens\nRemeber\n(Island)\nThe Cat's hippie back catalogue has\nbeen raided by numerous artistes of\nlate, with covers of Wild World and Father and Son among ashed load of\ntracks that have been resurrected by\npopular modern beat combos. As a result you can hear his stuff on Radio2 as well as Radio1, which is kind of an achievement. Cat isn't his real name of course, and isn't even his name now. He got into\nreligion in a big way after a near death experience type thing, and changed his\nname to Yusuf islam( nice). Which religion he found escapes me for the\nmoment... He's turned his back on the\nwhole pop star thang, so there is no new material on this collection but Id are say at fifty one he still doesn't mind the royalties...\nTime hasn't dimmed the tender appeal of most of the twenty four( count 'em)\nmusical gems contained on this compilation. Buy it for your mum or dad this\nChristmas. You may have a job finding it, cos you'll be embarrassed asking the\ngirl with pierced bits at the counter in\nHMV. Try looking under' rock' or' pop' or maybe even' folk' or'( ch)easy list e ning'. Better still, you could wait until\nthe sales and rummage in the less than five quid bargain buckets. Then if you do get a copy make sure you listen to\nthe lyrics.\nChoose long hair. Choose a beard. Choose a funny oldman called Cat Stevens. Enjoy.\n\u2022 Kunal ID Joel Ian\n\n"

    "content": "15 November 1999 \u2022 Felix Films 23\nDespite what you have probably heard about Fight Club, this is not a film about violence. Sorry to those of you who wanted to see Brad Pitt\nget his head smacked in. While it does involve a lot of bare knuckle fighting, it is more a story about one person, acted by Edward Norton, and how he accidentally found s a cult.\nBased on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk this film has been adapted for screen by Jim U hls. This is his debut screenplay and he has done extremely well. David Fincher directs this film in his very distinctive\nstyle. Most of you will know him from films such as The Game,S even, and Alien 3.\nThe main character narrates the story for you and occasionally talks to\nthe viewer in the first person. He tells you about himself and his day today life. All goes well until he meets Tyler Du rden( Pitt). Du rden is the\nsort of person who is always popular and everyone would love to be. He and the narrator start a fight club completely by accident and, as\nyou have probably heard from the film trailers, \"The first rule about Fight Club is not to talk about Fight Club.\" So I won't. Making a starring and fantastic appearance is Meatloaf He plays\nRobert Paulson who has had testicular cancer and now has big bitch\nbreasts. He acts his part extremely well and it is worth watching this\nfilm just for him. Also starring is Helen Boh nam Carter, not playing her usual English Rose character but more of ale achy type of person. The cast works incredibly well and it is rare to see so many famous people actually giving a good performance in one film. Fight Club is one of those films that you think you understand and quite enjoy. That is until about three quarters of the way through when it suddenly changes. The plot doesn't quite lose you as much as it con fuses you. This is the type of film that takes a while to sink in and leaves you wondering about various aspects for days later. It is full of\ndark humour and there is even a brief moment of idiocy when the film\nsuddenly seems like a modern day scene from Monty Python's Life of\nBrian.\nOk, what I said about violence isn't exactly true. There are fights and where they occur there are lots of fantastic special effects. It does get\na bit gruesome at times but at least the blood does look like blood. With the recent spate of \"slasher\" movies, finally abating with the release\nof Scream 3 early next year, it's a refreshing surprise to see more conventional supernatural thrillers picking up steam. The Sixth Sense is a welcome addition to this genre. This movie must have been a nightmare to pitch to studio executives.\nLet's take a story, by an unproven screenwriter/director, set in a genre last made popular in the mid1970' s, with the emphasis of the acting on a9 year old kid. Then add Bruce Willis as a psychiatrist, into the mix!\nGranted that Willis hasn't had a great track record when it comes to\nplaying a psychologist [Colour of Night anyone!) or acting opposite a child (Mercury Rising), it's a surprise that this movie works so well - the\nstudio execs must have had great hindsight to green-light this project.\nBut we should be thankful because M Night Shyamalan has been able to craft an extremely well acted and well delivered thriller that may not\nscare you out of your wits, but will definitely leave you with a sense of\nunease as you leave the cinema. Willis plays Dr Malcolm Crowe, a psychologist, who at the start of the\nmovie is shot by a former patient before the patient turns the gun on himself. We are then whisked towards \"The Next Fall\" where we meet\nCrowe. He now has a new patient, 9-year-old ColeS ear( Haley Joel\nOsment), who exhibits the same problems as the former patient - and so\nCrowe sees the ability to redeem himself in the boy.\nWhat unfolds is an exceptionally well-crafted piece of moviemaking in\nwhich the suspense factor is cranked right up. But what makes this movie really work is the acting. Who would have thought that Bruce Willis\ncould be able to convey emotions in a subtle manner without giving a one-liner, cracking his trademark smirk and then whipping out a gun before all hell breaks loose? Toni Collette, who plays Cole's mother, is\nalso outstanding as a woman who is trying to understand what is wrong with her son whilst keeping her family together. But the real discovery is\nOsment, whose acting in this movie is nothing short of incredible there\nare already whispers of an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\nHe'sable to hold his own in scenes with Willis and it's these scenes which provide the backbone of this movie. Much has been said about this movie's big twist ending, and all I can say is whatever you've heard is right. The ending in this movie belongs on the same mantelpiece as The Usual Suspects, and Seven amon goth ers, with the hints towards it being provided all throughout the movie. Helen Imran\n\n"

The journey was a contest in itself -a breakdown in communication left\nus without a keeper. The match started un tidily, with the wind and wet pitch causing problems for both sides. Mark, our new mid fi el der ( and a games editor of this\nesteemed paper, might I add) ferociously went for the bob... knees of\ntheir players, sliding in from all angles and nearly always winning the ball! After probing their box several times, IC scored albeit by\nan own goal from a Dan M cross.\nWe scored again soon afterwards,\na Dan W penalty from a foul on Dan M.OK, so perhaps we had been lucky so far but our third was pure class, Dan M passed to Dan W who flicked it back and the shot\nhit the top corner. In the second half the Dan and Dan show started\nagain but failed to break through. Instead, Anime sh, with Rivald o esque brilliance ran from halfway (with the ball for once!),\nthrust through the hole in their back\nline and lobbed his shot over the\nkeeper into the net. Another own goal put us 5 up and the game lost\nal! edge. With 2 0 mins to go, James decided to start playing and scored\naha trick. Blatantly offside (their ref.\nwas awful) for his first, no. two came from smart play by Matt on the left, who, abn g with Rob and Luis, worked hard all game even\nthough out of position. Before no.3, they pulled one back. A long ball\nfrom the back went over the otherwise excellent centre back pairing\nof the two Alex's to first-rate stand in\nkeeper Leon. The slippery wet ball\nfell from his glove less hands into the\npath of their onrushing striker who gently stroked it in. Furious at this\nlapse, Alex Jekyll n' Hyde went in\nsearch of a goal, steaming forward\nlike Jonah Lom u but getting\nnowhere before James sealed it\nwith his third, a simple nutmeg and the last kick of the game. School Of Pharmacy1 IC V3 After a midweek break for the team, with no match on Wed nes day, it was back to the serious\nbusiness of the league on Saturday.\nWith a record of2 wins, 1 loss\nso far, we needed to put together a run of victories to climb the table.S OP were last year's whipping boys, losing all but 2 of their\ngames, so we fancied our chances of boosting that goal diff e rence. After taking2 hours by\nminibus to travel from South Ken to Turkey Street, just by the M25 in North London, we were in no mood to slip up, and started the game brightly with skippy returning to Centre Back while Sol was away, giving \" tiger\" Rob free reign\nat right back. This soon proved to\nbe a great move, with the 1 st goal coming from Dino' head, the ag eing beast feeding off a great cross\nfrom Tiger, which left their keeper flapping and helpless. 1 -0. IC now clicked into gear with great\nmidfield work from JP in particular.\nHis reward was a chance to pick\nup the ball on right, drive infield,\nand let fly a fantastic shot which sailed over the keeper into the far corner for a man of the match winning goal, and it was20. More was to come, as Dino's persistence on the left led to a sharp cross to the centre, where\" Spaceman\" Lovell waited to apply an expert finish for30. We were now cruising, and thought the game was won by half\ntime. Unfortunately we took our foot off the pedal, and in the second half it was all SOP, with only\ngreat work by Buzz Foster at left\nback, along with Di j, skippy and Dave preventing more than the one SOP header. So, a disappointing result in the end, as we just never got started after the break.3points, but standards need togo higher if promotion is\ngoing to look likely. Luckily, a lovely warm5th team bath after\nthe game helped keep spirits\nhigh... Ultimate projectile is force to be reckoned with\nUltimate Frisbee\nFriendly Fire Tournament Wednesday3 rd November saw the\nfirst games of the new year for the\nDisc Doctors( the Imperial College Ultimate Frisbee team) in the form of a friend!y fire tournament at\nRegents Park. Kings and UCL stepped up to play, and as there\nwere so many of us, we split into\ntwo teams - a Dark side, and a Lightside.\nThe Dark side The Dark side played Kings first,\nwhose recent addition was an ex\nDiscdoctors player ( and ISE stu-dent). We opened with a gorgeous cut from Martin into the oppositions' endzone. Unfortunately Kings replied with two cheeky points. The Dark side felt they had had their chance and promptly took three points on the trot. J ez kindly\nmade an appearance, and with\nbrushes firmly fixed in our minds, we finished whitewashing Kings,\ntaking them apart with 1-2 com bos from\" Waterboy\" and Worship Me. We finally beat them136. UCL were up next. \" Jabba the Tat\" kept up his extremely solid\nand tight defence, with \" The Italian Stallion\", although new was making some very tasty cuts from the stack and was rewarded with\nsome nice passes to him. The hammering of UCL was short and sweet, and although we didn't bagel them, we still trounced them134. Finally, before it got too dark\nto play, we played the Lightside.\nAlthough not really a match, we still bea t them62, and Worship Me and Martin demonstrated that\npractice makes perfect, because on their 5 0 th attempt, they finally\nmanaged to huck it into the endzone for a point.\nThe Lightside\nOur first match of the day was against UCL. Within the first half\nhour we were up50. The arriva!\nof Catch started our plummet to the depths of despair. Within15 minutes we were level at 7 all, how could we be doing so badly? After\nan hour the game was capped at11 points, with the score 1 0 - 9 to\nUCL. All we needed was2 straight\npoints to seal victory. The first\ncame from a quick response to our impending doom. But their\nresponse was just too good and they stole the game from us. 1 1 -10 to UCL. The second match was against Kings. We didn't disappoint our adoring fans with some storming play and solid defence. They didn't stand a chance, perhaps a little\nunfair but we still managed a win with the final score127 to the Lightside.\nOur final and most chall eng ing match was against ourselves\n(?). OK against the Dark side. With\nAstro-fuck having gone to work we were forced to pay ironman( no\nsubs). We started off well, but real ly couldn't bears ed. The final\nstraw came when Baby subbed off\ninjured and in the true spirit of the\ngame they gave us their Waterboy as a replacement. With that we quit with the score at 6 - 2 to the\nDark side. A special mention has to go out\nto Constant Pressure who courageously managed5 minutes of a match, then adopted his position of\nthe month the sideline.\n\n"

    "content": "6 Feature Felix \u2022 15 November 1999\nNothing to if b with me?\nThe nature of s cw Ki fic responsibility\nEngage any group of scientists or engineers\nin discussion over any ethical, political or sociological issue and you're sure to hear\nthe mantra \" knowledge for knowledge's sake\" repeated more than once. The insinuation is\nthat pure research is free from any outside influences or concerns, that it is driven by a desire to\nunderstand, not by global impact or implication.\nBut is this true? Can scientists and engineers deny\nresponsibility for their work, or must they share\nblame and culpability along with credit?\nThe most obvious (and clich ed) example is\nobviously the Manhattan Project. Years later,\nmany of the leading figures on the project accepted that what they did, what they created, changed the face of the world - indeed it would be easy to\nargue that the invention of the atomic bomb intimately shaped the history and politics of the entire\nsecond half of the twentieth century. Yet some would still say that what they were engaged in was still a research based programme( attempting to\nharness atomic energy for the first time), and thus\nthe responsibility lies not with Oppenheimer and his team, but rather with President Truman and his\nmilitary advisors, who authorised the dropping of\nthe bomb. In actual fact, the Manhattan Project highlights the real problem with scientific responsibility - if you see the impending implications of your\nresearch, should you stop your work, despite the\n(seeming) certainty that someone else will reach\nthe same discoveries within the next few years? In\nthis case, their desire to design the bomb was driven by the threat of the German's constructing\none first (whether or not there ever was actually\nany chance of a Nazi atomic bomb is a whole different discussion). Although this is a very extreme\nexample, it's still a single example of a much more widespread( and, from amoral standpoint,\nincredibly complex) problem. To use a reasonably recent example, if you are on the verge of discovering the terminator\ngene for GM modified crops, should you follow\nthrough your research. On one hand, you'll gain prestige, cash and the foundations for GM research that could change the world for the bet-ter. On the other hand you'll develop a crop that\ncould destroy many third world economies and give one producer an incredibly dangerous monopoly. So, do you go ahead and give Mon santo the fruits of your research, or do you lock\neverything in a darkened cupboard? Well, some of you are probably thinking that you should (and\nmaybe would) take the moral high ground and bin\nyour work. But hang on, if you don't do it, you know full well that a group of US researchers in\nChicago are only a few months behind you, and they'll probably have given the gene to their\nbackers by the end of the year... So is there ever\nany point in trying to control your research, or should you always follow through on your work to\nthe greatest possible extent? Well, do you really\nthink that if the scientists engaged in the Man ha ttan Project had followed through on their threat\nand walked out on the US government in 1 9 4 4\nthe H bomb would never have happened? No, of\ncourse not - someone would have made the\nbreakthrough (although quite possibly not for many years) and who's to say that they would have been any more cautious with their in ven tion?\nThe real problem, then, is the fact that you will be labelled with the responsibility (whether\nyou choose to take it or not) for your discoveries,\nand yet you really have no say over them. The way research is funded means that there will\nalways be someone else out there with a say in\nyour invention, be they governmental, corporate,\ntrust based or even Imperial College of Science,\nTechnology and Medicine. And most backers will\nhave funded your research from profit driven, not\naltruistic, motives, so the likelihood of them listening to your moral judgements is slim to say the\nleast. Even if the most dangerous aspects of your\ndiscoveries are entirely accidental (they frequently\nare) your backers will still want to maximise their\nprofits (because, if nothing else, they will only be\nable to finance future R&D if your developments\nprove marketable).\nSo, does all that mean that the scientific community can deny all responsibility for the results of\nit's work? The problem is that, if taken too far,\nlogic of this kind can remove the weight of\nresponsibility from everyone. If the scientist is not\nresponsible for designing the invention, the manufacturer cannot be responsible for building it, or\nthe Chief Executive for deploying it. So we are left\nto hang the blame on the poor guy at the bottom\nwith his finger on the big red button or the syringe\n- but surely he's just obeying orders? Ultimately,\neveryone must accept their share, because all\nhave had a chance to make a difference, yet\nnone have. You could block the use of your in ven tion, by one means or another, and if you choose not to then with that choice you accept responsibility. As a final note, there's one interesting sidebar\nto my main example, the Manhattan Project. In\nthe fifty four years since the bombs were dropped, almost everyone involved in the programme has\nexpressed sorrow and remorse for what they did the scientists, the pilot, the man who opened the\nbomb bay doors with one key exception - the US government. Interpret that as you will...\nComments and feedback are very welcome email felix@ic.ac.uk.\nDAVID ROBERTS\n\n"

Iam well\naware that this play was not aimed at a wide section of the public and unless you area middle-aged homosexual unable to find the balance between a monogamous relationship and midnight sodomy with\nstrangers on the heath,\nthen the issues of this\nplay will perhaps seem a little distant.\nThe play attempted to\ndeal with these issues\nthrough the uncertain relationship between an older lover and a young guy in a boyband. The characters spent almost half the time butt naked or shagging. I respect\nthe actors for attempting\nsuch a hard core piece\nof theatre and the writer\nfor dealing with the issues in such a frank\nway but it never really\nworked.

Tate Gallery Pimlico tube\nFree\nIf you decide to visit this exhibition (and you should), you will not depart with the\nsame impression as us. That's what the Turner Prize is all about; it challenges our definition of \"art\". Short-listed for the prize this year are four very controversial artists\n- none more so than Tracy Emin. Her work is striking because of the wide range of\nresponses that it provokes. Her showpiece comprises of her sick bed, embroidered quilt (pictured above), memorabilia and video footage. Is she a self-centred narcissistic tart who boosts here go through capturing our sympathy? Or is she wanting\nto shame herself through laying bare her life to the judgement of others? Do you feel\nsorrow for her or contempt? Either way she has had a colourful and, at times, sordid past, which perhaps she is trying to reconcile through her work, coming to terms\nwith the trauma( particularly sexual) she describes in her childish scribbles. It'sp rob ably the most immediately accessible of all the work shown. Jane and Louise Wilson's display also studies aspects of human nature, through\nlooking at how experiences have become ingrained in the fabric of two distinct locations; the Hoover dam and a Las Vegas casino. Their wall to wall cinematic display\nnot only recreates the atmosphere and disorientation of the Casino life style (with it's wraparound visuals and evocative sound track), but it also reflects the uncertainly\nand cheapness of such an existence. The dam's corridors stretch away into nothing ness, complementing the casino footage, making you unsure which path or chance to take.\nSteve McQueen aims to produce a physical reaction in the viewer, this time more for comic effect. His Dead Pan is a recreation of a Buster Keaton sketch, with the side\nof a house falling on the artist, only for him to miraculously survive since the empty\nwindow frame falls around him. This promotes the idea of gravity creating a solid\nand very real threat, and of the artist taking a risk for his trade. His work can be\ninterpreted in a number of ways, and in spite of the fact that it is not immediately\naccessible, this makes is all the more rewarding.\nOn the surface Steven Pippin's work seems more like science than art. He has converted twelve washing machines in to pin hole cameras, capable of developing their\nslides within the washing cycle. These pictures are displayed in series along the wall, but unfortunately the concept of how they were taken is more exciting than what you actually see - although him walking through the launder et te in his y fronts with a visible erection may be interesting to some.

Imagine if he had claimed that Nazi views and po lcie s were Christrian teachings. Would we refer to him( or other fascists) as\nChristian fundamentalists, fanatics\nor extremists? Almost certainly not\nbecause we know that fascist thinking goes against true Christian teaching and thus that his claims to\nbe Christian were false.\nSo why is that Felix has decided to insult the some300 Muslim students and staff at IC by declaring on the front page that iCU Council Meeting is under threat from \"Islam-ic\" fundamentalists? These and other wacko groups may well be\n\" fundamentalist\",\" extreme is t\"or\" fanatical\" but the message they\nconvey is not Islamic.\nOf course, while we might\ndeserve an apology, we probably\ncan't expect one. After all, the Runnymede Trust in 1 9 9 7 published a detailed report on the endemic nature of Islam op bob i a in the British\nmedia and has set up a commission to monitor it. Virtually a day goes by\nwithout some newspaper report of\nsome dod gy group claiming to be\nIslamic who are then portrayed as\nsuch. Holy wood films such as True\nLies (which portray Muslims as ter-r or is ts) don't help much either. The average Briton's ste ore type of a Muslim is an Arab or Asian branding\na kalashnikov out to kill all the Jewish people they can find.\nIn fact, Islam a phobia is not just\na British phenomenon but a world wide problem. So much so that it\nhas enabled people like Sol bod an Mi lose vic to exploit public sentiment\nby gaining popular support, in their\nown country, for\" ethnic\" cleansing\nof Muslims in Bosnia and Kosova. We now see Russian leaders exploiting their own citizens' Islam a phobia in exactly the same way to gain sup port for slaughtering more Muslims in Chechen ya. These practices are, of course, very similar to those used\nby Hitler in Germany to gain pop u lar support for the per section of\nJews.\nWhat we can expect from Felix,\nhowever, is clear reporting which\nbreaks down stereotypes rather than\nstrengthening them. Islam is now the\nsecond most widely practised religion in Britain (and indeed the rest\nof the world). Followers come from\nall walks of life and it is neither\nfanatical no rex tere mist. Its message, however, is often distorted by\nsome people claiming to be Mu slims for their own political ends\n(especially when an ignorant body\nof people can be exploited). I trust\nthat Gareth Morgan will, in future,\nmake a more appropriate choice of\nwords when describing extremist\ngroups which claim to Islamic but\nconvey a very different message.\nYours faithfully,\nMustafa Arif\nISE 1\nWATERSTONES SURVEY\nDear Felix,\nI would like to start another dis-cus sion. Waterstones is a wonderful\nshop which gets all the books the\nstudents need and on time too/ Waterstones is a terrible shop which\ngets massive advantage of being on campus and yet gives nothing in\nreturn.\n[* Delete as applicable.

The Christian Union at Imperial\nCollege is entirely run by IC stu-dents, and is affiliated with CUs at\nmost other UK Universities. We are funded entirely by our current and former members, and are open to\nall members of IC - everyone is very\nwelcome to all CU events.\nThe CU aims to uphold Biblical\nChristianity, so it is essential that this\nis upheld by the society officers. For this reason all our officers sign a widely accepted declaration of faith,\nwhich is why we are not currently a nICU society.\nPeter Middleton Christian Union President\nVOICE OF REASON RETURNS\nDear Dave, Hating ding dong battles on the\nletters page as I do,I 'll be brief.\nBreakpoint, this is my final word before they nail the lid back down on my coffin. Firstly, the medics did read my column, which is why so many of them took offence. Second ly, the Union fed me remarkably little information- false or otherwise-over the course of my time; while\nmembers of Sherfield will sing like\ncanaries, getting juicy titbits out of\nmost of ICU is much less simple.\nThirdly, my letter, if you recall, merely stated that attacks on the Union should be undertaken cautiously, not\navoided entirely. Forme to claim\nthat the Union should not be attacked in Felix is about as believable as George Best being a front-man for Alcoholics Anonymous. Finally, I have never been in the\npocket of any Union official. I may have got on amicably with several of\nthem, but then I have had a pint with\nIan Caldwell. Nuff said.\nI shouldn't really be writing this.\nIt doesn't offend me, but it was a tad\nwide of the mark. Last week's column was very good, though if you meet me down Southside, I 'll tell you\nwho the real frontrunner is for the\nRector's job. He eps was close, but\nthe preferred choice is a little more\nsurprising.\nGood night and God bless\nSimon Baker\nChe mPG The deadline for letters intended for publication is Wednesday 12 noon - drop into the porta-cabins or email felix@ic.ac.uk.

Or rather several problems, which left this play\ndrifting somewhat forlornly\nin space. All two of us in the\naudience were told the wacky story of a Kentish\nTown caterer who believed\nthat his mother was an astronaut. The play ended to the strains of Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, which I think just about summed up this surreal experience.\nGiven the constraints of this\ntiny theatre, the two-person\ncast (Anthony Best and Denise Lane) did what they\ncould. Mr Best did not always do his best, once for getting his lines rather\nnoticeably and needing three loud prompts. Ms Lane\nalso suffered from First\nNight Nerves and it concerns me that professional\nactors should be so amateurish, especially when the\npunters are paying good money.\nI find it hard to slam this play\n(I feel sorry for them). But if\nyou want to go, I'd hurry,\nbecause I suspect this per-form ance will be pulled long before the end of its scheduled season. \u2022 William Burns\n\"Let a thousand flowers bloom\" said Mao Tse T eung then stamped on their heads as he didn't like the colour. The fringe scene. It's made up of a number of sides; we have the writers who strive to\ncreate the truly original actors who try and breath life into the new scripts - and critics\nwho slag off both the others for being crap. Is there anyway out of this paradox. Nope. Fo r every great play there are thousands of\nrubbish ones there has to be. Yet without\nthe fringe scene( which allows experimental theatre to develop) we would ne v er have the truly great.\nMost of the stuff on at the fringe is bad. But\nthis does not mean it is worthless. For\nsomething to be original it must take a risk\n- and that risk is that it will end up being crap. We all remember Shakespeare, but there\nwere hundreds of play writes around at the\ntime; most were infinitely forgettable, but\nShakespeare would neve r have developed without actors willing to act and theatres in\nneed of shows. New original theatre is very rare and to\ntop it off - when it does come along, society dismisses it as worthless as it is not\nready yet. But this is the only way it can be\n- there needs to be a large and vibrant\nfringe scene full off crap which the great\nwill transcend. And yes we even need the\ncritics trashing every thing they don't understand and hailing something as a masterpiece every fortnight or so. Let a thousand flowers bloom, but accept most of them will be ugly.\nBen\nRoyal College\nScience Union\nan u an\nMonday 15 November\n7:30pm in the\nSenior Common Room\n\n"

Beverly, her mother and one time political activist, is\nfiercely independent yet her life is\nshattered as she suffers a debilitating stroke and becomes increasingly reliant on those around her. Elena, Suzanne' s feisty daughter, loses her job as a waitress and is forced to move back in with her mother.\nAs they are thrown together, the women are forced to readjust\ntheir lives and reconsider their\nrelationships. Piercy tackles both\nmaternal responsibilities and filial\nloyalty in away that is chall eng ing yet poignant. The story also touches on issues as diverse as euthanasia and adultery.\nThe book is written from the point of view of all three women and the author' attention to detail allows the reader to emp a this e with all the main characters. However, at times I found the\nbook, particularly the references\nto American law, very heavy going. If you like intense, roman tic sagas, this is the book for you l Unfortunately, it is not the book for me. books\nEngland England, Julian Barnes\nThis one goes out to all the Murdoch haters out there. Nominated for the 1 9 9 8\nBooker, here is a book that builds upon the standard theme of art being used as\na substitute for reality. The book starts out with an exploration of the manner in\nwhich we construct artificial worlds, only to finish with a scathing attack on what Barnes generally perceives as a lack of consciousness with regard to true authenticity and heritage.\nThe basic story line follows the rather grandiose scheme of multimillionaire Sir\nJack Pitman to create the greatest tourist attraction ever - the theme park to beat\nall theme parks. This is no ordinary park, this one occupies the whole of the Isle\nof Wight! The isle, now re-christened \" England, England\" has lifelike replicas -and in some cases, the originals which have been specially moved there - of all the usual tourist attractions that earn the British Isles so much of their wealth. Stonehenge, Westminster Abbey and even Buckingham Palace are included in Pitman's collection. With the Royal Family, The Times and Manchester United FC all set firmly in place on the Isle, \" England, England\" sets all out to bring the once mighty nation to its knees.\nThe central character is the cynic Martha Cochrane who, despite being unusual ly dissatisfied about things in general, manages to get involved with this giant project and eventually blackmails her way right to the top. Barnes is at his best\nwhen depicting Martha, whose dialogue rings very true and is never overly harsh\ndespite the ever-present sarcastic undertones. However, the end is fairly dire and predictable; England, England declares its\nindependence, joins the EU, shrugs off the mainland completely and generally leads the rest of the world to first ignore and then condemn the mainland. Old England in a desperate bid to regain some credibility re-christens itself \" Anglia\" and then expels the errant island. The Times (which has moved along with all other institutions - to the Isle) labels this the act of a\" bankrupt parent exasperated ly declaring that it would no longer underwrite the bills of its millionaire child\".\nThe world at large begins to forget about everything to do directly with Old England, and the island simply reverts back to the quaint primitive days of yore. The focus shifts back to Martha at this point, as she reflects on how things have\nchanged so rapidly.\nThe end really does seem tagged on, however. It is extremely abrupt and everything changes in the space of a few pages. This disturbs the narrative flow and means that it doesn't finish strongly.\nIf you're a fan of the dry acerbic form of satirical wit Barnes has employed frequently, then there area few gems, but if not then there is little reason to read it.\nThe Restraint\nof Beasts,\nMagnus Mills\nThe first novel by Mills,\nwho worked as a bus driver during its writing,\nThe Restraint of Beasts is\na book of real character\nand comic charm. Two Scottish working class brothers, Tarn and Richie, wannabe hard-rockers and slacker fence builders, provide\nthe humour as viewed by\nthe poor soul freshly\nassigned as the boys\nforeman. While not quite a laugh a page, I did laugh out loud countless times\nduring the course of\nreading, prompted by\nMills deadpan delivery\nand the apparent idiocy\nof the two brothers, who manage to get them selves into all sorts of\ntrouble.\nA fresh change of pace and well worth a look.

Last Sunday was the biggest day of Bo's year, the Brighton run. Along with five hundred other\nveteran cars, Bo' headed to Hyde Park and the starting line. Paul\nknew he had forgotten something until a silver car suddenly pulled up in front of him. Out jumped Professor Briscoe, the Dean of C&G. No wonder Bo'w as going so well -we'd forgotten the passenger.\nEight o' clock was Bo's starting\ntime and he set off from the start\nline doing his own impression of\nnine three legged horses in an attempt to catch up with C lem, the\nRS M mascot. Unfortunately in the\ntwenty-five years between the construction of the two mascots, they\nhad learnt how to make engines -so Bo' had no chance. I believe the Dean would like\nto say the journey was uneventful.\nWhat he did say is he was impressed with Bo's road holding. Unfortunately Paul made full use of\nhis pilot like reactions and very little use of the brakes. He is yet to\nunderstand that ninety-seven year\nold cars are not meant to out accelerate and overtake modern vehicles.\nAfter a remarkably smooth trip,\nBo' arrived in Brighton to be greeted by a Boo malak a. This year all the motorized mascots made it to Brighton and the RS M even joined\nC&G for dinner. Copious quant i ties of wine were drunk, especially\nby Mike the Derrick rider.

As before you wander about a Warcrafr-like map, fighting monsters and trying to\naccomplish goals. As you whack monsters, they can leave behind gold and equipment that you can use to\nimprove your character, plus your skills and hit points\nas you fight. Upon completing your goal, you can move on to the next mission, or hang around and explore the map fully, looking for more monsters and more gold. Between missions, you stop at towns to trade stuff, or hire mercenaries if you think the next\nmission will require an extra body.\nWhat is great about this game is its non-linearity. You\ndon't have to do the quests in a particular order, you can choose which quest and when. On the down side\nthe graphics are not very advanced so do not expect\nto be wowed. Also, the character's movements are quite jerky and slow. Saying this graphics are seco nd ary in these sorts of games and it is really the\nplay ability and interaction that you're after.\nROM2 features a simple but effective battle structure,\nakin to the world of WarCraft. Point and click to tell\nyour character what to do, which spell to cast, which\nmonster to attack, etc. Real time gameplay forces you\nto determine plans of attack before the fight, and ROM2 will keep you constantly thinking.\nOne thing which I found annoying about this game is\nthat it is very hard. Usually hard games make for an interesting challenge but when you keep on dying\nyou lose interest. It was a case of saving every couple of minutes for fearing of being massacred by certain\nzombies and other nefarious creature.\nIn conclusion the game is a nice RPG/strategy but\nthere is not much new here. I, personally enjoyed it\nbut it does have a jerky quality and is sometimes very\ntricky. If it weren't for the likes of Diablo II coming out soon I might have bought this game straight off but I think it is best to wait for it to come out in budget.\nNocturne (PC)\nI can't remember the last time I was as disappointed in a game as I was with N oc tur ne. I read all the hype,\ndrooled over the screenshots and was so excited to have\na preview copy, I could hardly get the CD into the drive.\nI would guess that the feeling of excitement lasted about\ntwo minutes once I started playing the game itself. The problem is that it iac ks that most important element ina decent, original, idea. This game has been made so many times before, so much better. This is the kind of\ngame that causes me to lose faith in the industry. I mean, the guys who write these games must be intelligent or they couldn't cope with the programming. So how can no one in this big group of intelligent people spot that\nwhat you are releasing is a pile of warmed-over repetitive rubbish?\nFirst off, any sense of immersion in the game, vitally\nimportant in horror games if it is going to be scary in the\nslightest, is destroyed by the infuriating fixed third person\nviewpoint. The graphics may be good, but as the only\nthing that actually moves is the main character and a few pathetic looking walking corpses the visuals soon lose their appeal. The camera angles are so bad half the\ntime you can't even see your character - falling to your\ndeath over a precipice you couldn't even see because\nthe game engine is so poor is not my idea of fun.\nThen there is the combat. Aiming in third person is difficult enough, but the control system is even worse, lea ding to bizarre situations with my character standing in the\ncorner shooting at the ground instead of at the dog that\nwas busy gnawing my leg off. Personally, I think the only\nreason the bad guys are all slow moving zombies is that\nshooting anything moving much faster would be impossible due to the poor controls and camera angles.\nEven worse, in order to play Nocturne properly requires\na very high-end machine( about a Pentiumlll-450 and a decent 32-bit 3 D card). This is most definitely not the\nkind of game that would encourage me to upgrade. Avoid it as you would the walking, disease ridden\ncorpse of Maggie Thatcher.\nMark Ben\n\n"

    "content": "Big Issue Felix \u2022 15 November 1999\nAdvice Centre Update\nBY MARTIN THOMSON, UNION ADVISOR\n^ working in the uk j Many international (non European) students may still be unaware that\nas long as they don't have an entry\nclearance stamp which states that\nthey are prohibited from working, they can now work for up to 2 0\nhours per week in term time, or full\ntime in the vacations. This is\nbecause the government gave what\nthey described as \" blanket perm is sion\" to all students who have the\nrestriction stamp in June of this\nyear. (The restriction stamp is the\none that says that you need to get permission from the Secretary of\nState for Employment before you can work). Therefore, you can work\nin the Union or in College, you can take up summer placements or do any other kind of work without\nneeding to go through any further\nbureaucracy (apart from getting a National Insurance number l). Some employers are still confused by the changes, however, so if you experience any difficulties please\ncontact me. The situation for wor king after graduation is still the same and work permits are required. It\ncan be possible to stay on for a year or so to get work experience or to do some training but this won't allowed you to switch over to a full\nwork permit. Let me know if you have any questions.\nC. housing^ You'll have to forgive me for going on about housing, and I hope that\neveryone is reasonably settled into\ntheir accommodation at this point.\nI think that a couple of things\nare worthy of reminder; firstly, if\nyou did not get an inventory taken\nwhen you moved in, you should have done one yourselves. If you haven'td one this, do it now and take photographs of the property\nso you can show what it was like in\nthe event of a dispute when you leave. Landlords do often keep deposits claiming that students\nhave caused damage. If you leave\nwithout an inventory or photographs, it can be very hard to\nargue a case.\nIf anything breaks while you are in the property through wear and tear (a chair, an appliance etc)\nyou must write to the landlord and notify them of this. Otherwise when you leave you may face deductions from your deposit.\nSimilarly, if something is in\nlord, simply notifying him/her of\nthe problem. Keep a copy and make sure it is dated. The reason\nfor this is that if the landlord were\nto refuse to do the repair and you had to take further action, a court\nwould not expect the landlord to\nknow about the problem until you can show that you brought it to\ntheir attention. If a landlord does need of repair, there are two steps\nyou must take. Firstly, check your\ntenancy agreement to see whether\nor not the landlord can end it early.\nThis can only be done if the landlord has a\" break clause\" in\nhis/her favour, and this is not a standard clause. If there is a break\nclause, this should have an impact on your negotiating position because you may want to be as\nnice to the landlord as possible\nwhile getting the repair done. If\nthere is no break clause and you are, for example, secure in your\nflat until the end of term, the first\nthing to do is to write to your land-not carry out repairs within a reasonable time, they are in breach of\ncontract.\nIf, for whatever reason, you are\nthinking of leaving your accommodation early, it is essential that you check your legal position. Even\nthough you might have a morally\ngood reason for moving out, this\nmay not release you from your\ncontract. If you break a contract,\nlandlords can( and sometimes do) sue former tenants, especially when they have guarantors. It is\nalso sometimes possible for your\nco-tenants to sue you if you break\nyour contract and they lose money.\nc. cash flow j It's boring I know but if you haven'td one it this term, make sure you set\nyourself a budget for the next. Budgeting is as simple as dividing your\ntermly income into weeks, and then\nsubdividing into the things that you\nneed and the things that you want.\nWe're working on revising and reprinting our Financial Guide which will have more information\non budgeting. If you need any help\nin working out a budget, get in\ntouch. Access funds are available now for home students from the Student\nFinance Office, room335 Sherf ie ld. Lookout for the notices\naround College. There are also\nlimited hardship funds for international students and the City and Guilds, Royal College of Science,\nand Royal School of Mines all have\nConstituent College Association Hardship Trusts which might be\nable to give some help to students\nin genuine and unexpected hard ship. Fundraising is very difficult for students who have started a course\nwithout adequate funding, but it is\nusually possible to get at least some help for those who are in the last six\nmonths of a course and facing\nunexpected difficulties.\nChristmas is a great time for racking up credit debts. There is a lot that can be done to manage credit debts when things become hard to cope with and this includes\ngetting help arranging affordable\nrepayment plans with creditors and holding off court action. If you find\nyourself with multiple credit debts\nand you are juggling one debt to\npay for the other then please come and see me. The Advice Service\nassists people with debt problems in\na strictly impartial and non judge mental manner. I'm here to help,\nnot to lecture.\nc contact\nTo make an appointment to call in\nfor a confidential chat about any problem, big or small, call Union Reception on01715948060, contact me directly on internal\nextension48067, or email m.m. thomson@ ic.a c.uk.

All three goals illustrated his goal scoring prowess but the pick of the\nbunch was the third set up by an unselfish pass off the goal post by\nGeography teacher.\nThe team the relaxed expecting\na walkover but were broken up by\na textbook short corner by the opposition. From the restart IC\nwere back into action and attacking form as the Geography teacher\ngot the just deserts for his phenom enal midfield vision and individual\nskill with a hat trick forever logged in all our minds. After a textbook\nshort corner strike, our main man dribbled past 5 men and struck the\nball firmly past the keeper into the\nleft corner. The crowd went wild\nand girls started throwing their\nknickers on the field, as Geography teacher came back to strike his\nthird. Giles tamely scored a seventh, roofing the ball into the net.\nA sensational team performance worthy of the score line against a fired and organised team. IC I1 Royal Holloway I0 Another day, another game and another victory for the mighty\nfirsts. The fine form of recent\nweeks continued straight from the\nkick off. Resolute defending, fine\npassing in the midfield and varied\nmovement from. the forwards combined to leave the boys from\nHolloway in a daze. Early in the\nsecond half, with the wind in our sails, Foulstone whipped in a co rner that found the boot of Rich.\nThe resulting shot curled past the\nbemused Holloway keeper into\nthe roof of the net. The team maintained its impenetrable integrity until the final whistle,\nholding out for a fine victory.\nThis result leaves the firsts in a strong position in the BUS A league: Bring on the rest of the\ncountry!\nCarried over from Saturday\n3 0 / 1 0 / 9 9 (sorry for the delay)\nRUM S1ICS MI3 ICS M continued their winning streak by beating RUMS at Turkey\nStreet. Formed as a result of the merger between Royal Free and UCH, RUMS had the capability to provide tricky opposition. How ev er, ICS M had the upper hand in\nthe first half and took the lead after some clever wing play resulted in Jonathan Kennedy putting in\nan excellent cross forK a shAkhtar to head home. The lead was doubled10 minutes later when J ere my Welch pounced on a loose ball after a corner and thundered home from close range. The game became a lot more physical in the second half with\nlots of late tackles flying in from all over the place. J ez Welch led the way by flying in where angels fear to tread, and was ably followed by the rest of his teammates who showed the passion and teamwork that has been a defining feature of the season so far.\nThe ICS M defence fared well\nagainst a potent attack and E ammon Rabie in particular helped neuter the RUMS strikers. The ICS M team lost its way somewhat as the game degenerated into a physical battle, but then wrapped the game up with 2 0 minutes left\nas Ka shAkhtar pounced on a fumble by the RUMS keeper and back heeled the ball beyond the\ndespairing defenders into the net.\nRUMS scored a solitary goal near the end after a goal mouth scramble, but by then ICS M had the game we l!and truly in the\nbag.

The scene was windswept, desolate and the GA was at least 8 foot tall. Great. This\nmeant that Rachel had no chance of getting rebounds and therefore\nAlex had the novel task of marking both the GS and the GA in the c ir cle. Well done Alex. At half time\nthe scores were evens. But then the\ncurse of the third quarter struck\nagain and we fell behind1522 with 1 5 minutes togo. Some fabulous play from the girls in the\ncentre (Dorothy, Becky and Paula)\nand some hot shooting from those\nstarlets Rebekah and Sarah saw us\npull it back.

Despite Magic Hani and Captain Julien\ndisplaying great skills in their\nimpressive victories, Olivier and Anton is were severely crushed by\nRoyal Holloway' s\" bizarre\" tal ents. The score was all even again after the doubles but the set\nlost in one of the doubles proved to be fatal.\nFinal Score: IC 3-3 RH UL but\nRH UL won76 in sets.\nMatch2 of IC's campaign quickly turned into a nightmare for UCH. Fielding the same team that\nhad lost 6-0 last year, UCH were\nonce more whitewashed. Playboy\nChris and our German prodigies\nJan and Christoph each thrashed\ntheir opponents, dropping only\none game each. Medic Jason decided to do the same only after\nhaving lost the first set.

It didn't take\nmuch for the talented Clark Kent\nto beat the( larger than life)\nQ MW defenders. Her2 added to The Mayors first goal of the season meant we were3 nil up at\nhalf time.

The antique car successfully completed\nthe journey in 7hours. Unfortunately\nwith only 1 2 people showing any interest in the 7 2 possible places,\nC& GU was unable to justify the cost\nof the coach.

They\nhatched a plot to kidnap and drive\nA few Guildsmen still made it to Brighton Photo: Archive\nhim to the car run in their Guilds mobile1. It was decided to go ahead if it\ncould be done legally. They formed\nan alliance With Chris Campbell, the\nLondon Student Editor, and arrived at\nMr Butt's house on Sunday morning,\nonly to learn they had been set up. Mr Campbell refused to let them through\nthe perimeter fencing and then stood\nby as Mr Butt appeared from behind\na wall and shot at them with a Supersoaker.\nThis latest flop comes soon after\nthe Star Wars party where only 3 5 out\nof a possible 1 0 0 tickets were sold\nresulting in a loss of \u00a3236. C& GU President Dines hG an esa rajah explained his intention was to try and keep the students entertained during\nthe winter term, viewing this as a weakness of Guilds in previous years.\nMr Gan esa rajah took the view\nthat risks needed to be taken in order\nto find appropriate entertainment,\nsaying \"The experimental nature of\nthe previous events always meant they\nheld the possibility of being un pop u lar to the masses, hence the minimal\nexpenditure.\"\nHe hopes that the combination of\na strong reputation and creative production will make the upcoming C&G Fresher's Dinner a success.\nThe event is to be held in Sherfield on Friday 1 9 November at 7 pm. Tickets are available at Waterstones\nand the CCS shop costing \u00a3 1 5 for\nFreshers and \u00a31 7 for other students.\nNewton sets out plan for an NUS free future for all\nSUNIL RAO\nImperial College Union is to host a conference for independent student\nunions and those who are considering d is affiliating from the National Union of Students, with the aim of\nsetting up a buying consortium. This\nwould bean alternative to the National Union of Students Services\nLimited (NUSSL), the NU Spur cha sing group. Currently, NUSS L provides a platform to buy beer and other\ngoods that student unions require at\na bulk discount. The sheer size of\nthis student market has resulted in\nNUSS L reaching the maximum level\nof discounting that most suppliers\ncan provide. However, a student\nunion cannot be a part of NUSS L without paying a large subscription -if ICU were to join, it would mean paying around thirty thousand pounds annually.\nNUSS L is inextricably mired in\nthe politics of the NUS, and it is\nimpossible to leave the NUS without\nalso leaving NUSS L[ as described in\nThem and NUS in Felix 1 1 5 5 ] .\nMany student unions that disagree\nwith the political stance of the NUS are remaining with it because of\nNUSS L. Tasha Newton, ICU President, believes that the rate of d is affiliation will rise dramatically as soon as a local alternative that is\ndemonstrably as good is offered.\nICU buys from a range of sup pliers including Northern Services\n(annual fee \u00a325), a consortium set\nup to serve the Scottish Universities,\nand TU CO, the College purchasing\ngroup. The conference, to be held on4 December, will present a range of\noptions to the unions, including setting up a \"Southern Services\" group, or expanding TU CO. Both would offer considerable buying power for\nmembers and be a viable alternative to NUSS L. They would also\nallow ICU access to greater discounts and therefore better value\ngoods. When contacted, Tasha Newton commented, \"This is potentially\nsomething really \u2022 exciting, but my\npriority will always be getting the\nbest deals for IC students\".\n\n"

The author suggested that noo ne at IC ' had it in them' when referring to the Maths couple caught\nin flagrant edel ic to in their locker\nroom. Does the Editor not think it is\ndemeaning to the students here at\nIC to have their own student news-paper put them down as un adventurous when we already have to put\nup with insults from the rest of the\ncountry's student body?\nWe assure you that this is not a solitary example and the maths cou ple should not be made a spectacle\nof in a paper with such a wide audience. Maybe the Editor has heard of\ncouples using such places as the\nmain library, or even the Sherfield\nbuilding for uses other than those\nthe buildings were intended for?\nObviously not. A walk around campus may open the Editor's eyes\nto the more exciting aspects of\nImperial College. Happy hunting,\nRS M II\nSHOP STRIFE\nDear Sir,\nIt was interesting to be rem in ded of this year's graduation by the\naccount in Felix a few issues ago because as well as being the edi tor's graduation, it was also my\nfriend's. Imagine how joyous this\noccasion is: the proud family loo king on, the photographs, the presents and the graduation card with\n\" congratulations\" inscribed. Not, however, if one were to visit ICU shop.\nA week before graduation, I went to buy all the associated memorabilia, i.e. ties, teddies and scarves to remind the graduate of\nhis past life at Imperial along with a graduation card. Quite a common occurrence, graduation, especially\nat a college one might be lead to\nbelieve but not one single card was\navailable at the shop. After asking, I was told they might be ordered but\nthe staff seemed more interested in\nignoring the request for fear of sticking more price tags on t shirts. On the Monday before graduation, I was told the graduation items would be included in stock and visited\nagain but to no avail but was told\nsanctuary was available on the day\nin the Union with a little stall. No such luck - it was only T shirts and mugs.\nHow can a simple card like\ngraduation be omitted from stocks\nat Graduation time? If I wanted to\nbuy a card from ICU shop on practically any other subject, I could do so, even if I wanted to make indecent proposals I could do so from\nthe vast collection available! Let\nother IC students join in the celebr ation of their peer's excellence at\nleaving Imperial and not say, \" Oh, sorry, ICU shop couldn't be assed to\nstock it \"\nYours faithfully,\nICU Shop's best customer\nAND FINALLY...\nDear Felix\nI would like to commend you on\nthe improvements made within the\nreviews pages this year. The breadth\nand depth across f he whole of the\nmusic, clubbing, film, books and arts world is to be applauded. I would especially like to mention the\nBlair Witch feature and the diverse\nclub and art features that have fe a ture gay and fetish themes. I was\ntherefore appalled when I read the\nslating Felix received in Prince Albert\nthis week. Not only were the insults\nill thought out, but the text content\nwas worse than the childish rants\nthat I have sometimes seen in the\nC&G rag - Guildsheet. The writers\nof this magazine obvious have a number of problems, the first is\nbeing happy to come to an opinion\nbased on nothing less than prejudice\nand the second is being obsessed\nwith rude words (very clever).\nYours with love\nBen James (not my real name)\nMedicine4 PS. Please put my sleepless nights at\nend - who is this amazing girl [see\neditorial, 1156]. I 've spent all last\nweek searching for her.\nAll complaints should be addressed to the Editor.

Mustafa raises an interesting pint\nthat applies not just to so called\" Islamic\" fundamentalists but, on a broader canvass, to any form of supposedly religion based terrorism or extremism. After all, to the best of my knowledge, there is no major religion on the\nplanet that actually condones( let\nalone advocates) the murder of\nothers( nonbelievers, sinners, whatever) - and yet, throughout history, religion has been the\ncause of more and bloodier wars than anything or anyone else.\nSo,( to get back to the point)\nboth myself and Gareth apologise unreservedly. We term them\" Islamic\" simply because they do so themselves, not out of any\nsense of abuse or discrimination. indeed the biggest problem with finding an adequate terminology for these groups is the\nfact that it's very hard to find out\nwhat they do believe in. As a final point, Ido take the\nsuggestion that Iam Islam oph o bic very personally, but I hope this reply will help to change your mind. CAMP U The various shopping facilities\noffered on campus have been on my mind a lot this week. On the\nopposite page you' ll find comments on both Water stone's and the ICU Shop, and in various discussions I 've had with College staff this week, Water stones and' he Computer Centre Shop in\nMe chEng have been frequent topics of debate. All of these services have a very powerful position on cam pus, perhaps none more so than Water stone's. Having won a very\nprestigious contract nearly three\nyears ago( usurping the old Union bookstore), Waters to nc' s promised to establish a well stocked, competitive and prof es r vice that would act as\nnal academic flagship o and a half years after\nopened, where do we elves? Well, aside from JS now been unc e remo umped in favour of one enough books. Now, lm sorry,\nbut it seems to me that if you' rerunning a bookstore on a university campus if might be wise to\nstock sufficient quantities of the\ncore first year text books, if no th ing else. It's patently obvious that at least three quarters of the\nnew in take will always buy at\nleast one recommended book within the first two weeks( and then leave it to fester on the shelf\nuntil they realise, three years\nlater, that they can't remember the Second Law of Thermodynamics anymore) so why, for pity'sP sake, does Water stone's stock. Of course, whether or not\nfilling half the shop with fiction and travel titles helps is deb at minimum of a service that we\nshould expect. A good campus bookstore would use it's purchasing power( a few hundred copies might not be much in fiction terms, but in terms of academic texts it's huge) to ne got i ate good discounts and sensible student prices - much like the old Union Bookstore used to. It\n( shock, hor r or) could actually offer some helpful advice. So, now I 've finished my\nrant, what do you all think? OK, so the contract might not be up where when it's time to buy the\nnext ludicrously overpriced text\nWater stone' s,I'm waiting for "

Sadly forme, the\nreviews section always seems\nto bare the brunt of this\nabuse. However, insults such\nas everything we review is\nunheard of is just plain wrong. If the slanderers had bothered to examine the\nreview pages of Felix in recent\nweeks they'd have seen inter-views, reviews and competitions involving some of the\nmost mainstream artists in\nmusic, films, art and books. This week again sees another\nstorming line- up. For a start\nin the two following columns we see reviews of the new Foo Fighters and Mario h Carey albums and who can complain about that?\n... frequency...\nifs rubbish,\nnobody reads it?\nWith the rest of this space I'd like to make another plea for\npeople interested in writing\nmusic articles for Felix. Club writers are especially hard to\ncome by and if anyone is\ninterested in writing in going clubbing for free for the small\nexchange of a short article\nabout the night then I'd be\nmore than happy to have\nyou. If you're interested just\npop along to the Felix Portacabins for our music meetings\nat 1 2 . 3 0 pm on Tuesdays and we'll sort it out.\nFoo Fighters\nThere Is Nothing Left To Lose\n(Roswell/RCA)\nWhat have your heroes been? Actors? Politicians? Sportsmen and sportswomen? Outstanding scientists and businessmen? Balls to all that. My heroes have always been musicians. Not your pon cy lack of\nsubstance boyband s or those more than useless one hit wonders, but proper kick-ass don't give-a shit stars: Jimmy Page, Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix, Flea all those with a presence and attitude. The Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl is up there too he's got to be. From powerhouse drumming with you know who, to laying down the Foo Fighters' 1 9 9 5 debut alone, he's more than just a slightly motivated blok e. This latest offering from the Foo s is more of that driven power pop that they've made their own. I read somewhere that the Foo Fighters missed the mark with There\nIs Nothing Left To Lose because ifs too upbeat to be grunge. Can we please set the record straight: THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS GRUNGE. Invented to create a niche and sell records; 'nuff said. And no, this album isn't that Seattle sound that served Dave Grohl so well\nin the past - I'm sure he doesn't want it to be. We kick off as we mean to goon with the huge chorus of Stacked Actors. I had this on my Walkman and ended up dancing along the\nstreet like a lunatic, a sure sign of a premium tune. The drums play\na large part in the Foo Fighters' sound, possibly because that's what Dave Grohl started with, but I always find the drum lines are that little bit more involving and subsequently the songs are given a greater depth. That's not to say any other part of the track is neglected; the\nguitars have a distinctive warm, fuzzy overdrive and in Dave Grohl' s voice there's a harsh edge to the soft gentleness as demonstrated to good effect on Live-In Skin.\nThere are so many tracks worthy of being singles on There Is... I'm surprised there weren't two albums released. There really isn't any filler. Generator has a great Talk box effect on lead guitar, Next Year\nis a superb song to lead us into Autumn with ifs wistful lyrics and Aurora is in a similar cavernous vein to February Stars.\nThe Foo Fighters have brought us a beautiful third album, a more poppy sound but a rounded one too. They'll be around for a while yet, but I wouldn't expect any less from a man who has the band's logo tattooed on the back of his neck.\nMarian Carey\nRainbow\n(Columbia)\nOh, Mariah, Mariah, Mariah. Back so\nsoon? I'm not generally of the school of\nthought that thinks that if anything is pop u lar it must by definition be bad, but I heard\nan interesting statistic the other day that\nhas started to change my mind. It was that\nMariah Carey is the best selling female\nartist of the 1 9 9 0 s, has sold over 1 1 5 million albums. I mean, who bought these\nalbums? Where are they and why are they\nstill allowed their statutory rights?\nThat Ms Carey should outsell Madonna, Whitney Houston or even her musical\nnemesis Celine Dion is unbelievable. I admit that in the past she has released\nsome fairly good singles, notably Hero, (7/\nBe There and... er.. .anyway, she can certainly Sing (she's a vocal range of 8 octaves\nyou know). Fine, but the point is, should we\nbuy this album for musical pleasure or\nbecause it is able to communicate within\nthe hearing range of next door's dog? Rainbow sees Mariah collaborating with\nmany R'n' B superstars but this is not an\nalbum for R'n' B fans. The first track Heart\nBroker begins in typical Mariah style with\nall the usual vocal acrobatics but then we\nget a somewhat unexpected rap interlude\nhalfway through. Finally, it's back to Mari ah. It really just doesn't work. She should\nstick to her epic ballads - they at least suit\nher style. The personal and understated\nmelody of Petals is the nearest she gets to\nthis but the rest, I'm afraid, just bored me.\nShe may be trying to move with the times\nbut ifs doubtful if all the millions who( for\nwhatever reason) love her, will want to\nmove with her.\n\u2022 Christian Rachael\n\n"

It's nothing to do with their DJ line-up,\nnothing to with the venue where they\nare held and nothing whatsoever to do with the state of the toilets. Quite sim ply, the club nights that stand head and shoulders above others are all about the vibe. They seem to capture the spirit of the house party and transport this\nheavenly atmosphere directly to a club\nvenue. Last Saturday's Club One night\nwas a perfect example of this.\nPut on by a group of people clearly\nmore interested in having a good time\nthan impressing anybody, Club One proved to be an excellent night for\nmore than just those out for a big one. With a techno-trance mix in the main room and eclectic mix of beats in the\nback room, c lubbers were treated to a mystical experience of music rarely\nserved in the more mainstream clubs.\nFrom people dancing like noone was watching to those just sitting around on the floor chilling out, this was a house\nparty in a club and the vibe was clear\nfor all to see. Indeed, as one walked around a feeling that everyone knew each other seemed to ooze from every\nSadly though, these Club One nights\nare something of a rarity, as they only\nseem to appear every few months with\nlittle promotion. Yet it is maybe this\ninfrequency that keeps the vibe so\nalive, and the people present so special. And this is why this club is not\ncalled Club One and why it is not held\nat VenueTwo. Sorry.\nJames\nRam Trilogy Parly @ The End\n..if you like it hard...\nWith the recent opening of home and Fabric, the End could have\nfound itself struggling to keep up. However, Friday night proved\nthat this venue and the genre of drum and bass can still get the\npunters in. This was a 'roadblock' event with the club almost full\nto capacity by midnight.\nThe first couple of sets in the main room were good without really getting the crowd jumping, playing music that anyone can easily get a hold of. The lounge was a more laid back affair with drum\nand bass being played first up, but not the real heavy bass line\nstuff, complementing the havoc being created in the main room. It then switched to hip hop before finishing with some chilled out\nbreaks and beats.\nEnter Roni Size on the decks, in the main room. His reputation\nprecedes him with main room getting packed out to the point that\nit was almost impossible to move. He played an excellent set with\na mixture of jazzy breaks, vocal tunes and bass heavy dub plates. He really did get the crowd going and the presence of MC Dyna mite only added to experience.\nNext up came the highlight of the night. Andy C came to the decks\nwith crowd at boiling point. Now to those of you that don't know,\nRam records is Andy Cs label and so you would expect this set\nto be special. He didn't disappoint. He played a technically ama zing set, running mixes at length and constructing the set well. He mixed up the set playing the very newest dub plates and dropping\nthe odd blast from the past- you didn't know which way he was\ngoing to take it next. Some might have felt that his set was maybe\ntoo bass heavy, but the n utters in the crowd were feeling it hard!!!\nNext up on the decks were the highly acclaimed producers, ed-rush & optical - they played a good set although it was a little anticlimactic after the mayhem that preceded it. Randall closed the\nnight off with a tight set mixing the b line styles with the more\nexperimental stuff.\nAll in all a good night was had by all, with a broad spectrum of\ndrum and bass catered for. Those of you that are interested, there\nmany more drum and bass nights from now to the end of the year\nat the End. It's still a wicked venue - pretty modern with a body\nshaking sound system. Watch out Fabric, the End isn't dead yet.\nGov Recommended\nClubbing\nThis week's selection is more than\nimpressive, so take your pick from this\nveritable box of delights.\nMonday 15th November\nBoom or Bust @ The Project; \u00a34\nFat Tony on the decks with more flavours than most. This club has\nchanged names loads, but remains a quality night out.\nThursday 18th November\nThe Beginning @ The End; \u00a33\nThis night is a proper party so make sure you're dressed up. DJs on rotation\ninclude Brandon Block, Streetboy and Alex P and three quid for this is more than a bargain.

Likewise, the maudlin sleeve shot\nof the four unsmiling lads nestled amongst a depressingly\nempty furniture sale implied a Radiohead esque offering of\ndoom and despair. And in fact, if\nyou listen to what they're saying\non the tracks, this is pretty much\nwhat you get. Subject matter\nincludes a badly failed relationship with a mate's little sister,\ndepression over other similarly\nfated relationships, and cynicism\nabout... well... broken relation-ships. Hmm. Not one to play if\nyou have any doubts about your\nability to hold down a steady\ngirl/boyfriend.\nHaving said this, The Little Moth ers' outlook on life never did the\ngreat blues musicians any harm\n(or Radiohead, for that matter),\nand there are a couple of genuinely good tracks on this\nalbum; If Love's What You Want\nbeing perhaps the best example\n- an acoustic tune about... guess what? Lyrics aside, the\nmusical arrangement make this\na good record for late at night -just make sure you haven't eaten\ncheese as well, or when you\nwake up your dreams will have\nturned you into a shivering neurotic pile of rubble. Ouch. Counting Crows\nThis Desert Life\n(Geffen/PAL)\nEveryone has listened to the Crows' first album August and Everything After - whilst not so many have heard their second Recovering the Satellites. This is due to the fact that August is regarded as\na classic whilst Satellites is not. Everyone knows the songs Round Here and Mr Jones but fewer people would be able to name any\nsongs from Satellites. The strange thing about this is that any reviews\n(both critical and popular) of Satellites that you read credit it as a worthy sequel to the bands first album. This Desert Life has been in my stereo nonstop since I received it\ndue to the simple fact that it is excellent. Adam Duritz's vocals continue in their despair whilst the music continues to rock in the chill\nout manner to which we have become accustomed. I can't find one bad track on the whole album but I can find a number that I just\nhave to comment on. Hanginaround opens the album with a bounce and vigour that will\nhave you singing along and moving your body in ways that you\nknow are embarrassing but that you just can't stop. All My Friends is\nboth one of the best things they've done and a classic mellowed out\ntune of despair. Highlife brings together a stellar arrangement with\nperfectly voiced lyrics. Finally / Wish I Was A Girl is just a ridiculously catchy tune even if it does goon for hours.\nOne thing I did notice however is that there are a couple of tracks\nwhich seem to have been heavily influenced by Ben Folds Five. Both\nMrs Potters Lullaby and Colourblind really could have been written\nby Ben Folds - but the strange( and great) thing is that they would both( especially Colourblind) be among the best tracks on the album and actually sound better with Duritz's vocals. It's possible that as in All My Friends \"All my friends and lovers leave meal one to try and have a little fun\" but I really wouldn't mind if I had this to listen to on my stereo. Or at least I wouldn't apart from the fact that I really want to go to that party on Friday night... If you didn't like August (or Satellites] then you probably won't like\nthis either, but if like me you loved them, then your money should already be out on the record shops counter. This Desert Life is an album that only the tasteless should miss.\nHHHHHHB\n^^^^\nRoyal Trux\nVeterans of Disorder\n(Domino)\nThe musical landscape at the end of\nthe 9 0 ' s is plagued by irony. Most of\nour pop stars are sufficiently well trained to talk the talk complete with a photogenic smile/ grimace/ look of\ncontemptuous aloofness, plastered upon their smug faces. In this climate, praise the fallen angel for bands like\nthe Royal Trux who are prepared to\nbelieve in rock ' n' roll as not just a badge but as a way of life. The two\nmain Trux, Neil Hager ty and Jennifer Her rem a, live a notoriously narcotic existence and over the past decade or so they have put out a string of records dubbed by many as un listenable and sham boli c. 'Veterans of Disorder1 is rock' n' roll in\nthe truest sense of that much maligned word. The first half of VO D sees Trux\ndrawl and snarl their way through a clutch of gloriously fucked up, raw and dirty mini masterpieces, every one suf-fused with the kind of swagger and attitude identifiable as the real deal. As\ntime progresses we reach Lunch Money\nin which the Trux get a bit atonal and experimental on our asses, but even the most dim right winger would find it\nhard not to see the beauty in the\nsquawking racket. We have now reached the point at which things start\nto self-destruct. The album could have done without a teeth grinding ly self-indulgent seven minute guitar solo finale which is Sickass Dog, but in the\nwake of such a joyous, unholy( and\nyes, sham boli c) piece of rock ' n' roll\nthis seems like a minor complaint. \u2022 Mart Tim \u2022 The Masked Bandit\n\n"

The title\nof the lecture was 'Will Climate Change Drive Nuclear Proliferation?' and it focused on whether\nnuclear energy could provide a solution to the threat of global warming.\nIf CO2 produced from fossil\nfuels is causing a substantial\nincrease in global temperature, one obvious solution would be to use an energy source that puts out no CO2, such as nuclear. A problem with\nnuclear energy is that it produces\nmaterial that, especially when reprocessed, can be used to build\nnuclear weapons. This manifests\nitself in nuclear proliferation, because nearly every country in the\nworld would have their own factories\npumping out material, which has up until now been the major limiting\nfactor in the making of nuclear\nweapons. Dr Has s ard argued that if dramatic changes to the climate did occur over a time scale of years,\nthen nuclear energy could be a short-term solution, halting the\nincrease in CO2 levels in the atmosphere until renewable energy\nsources become viable. Nuclear proliferation need not result, providing the reactors are designed to\nminimise the weapons grade material produced. Nuclear accountancy\ncould be sufficiently reliable to\nensure that there is no increase in\nthe availability of such material to\ndespotic regimes.\nThe next lecture to be held is\n'Verifying Nuclear Disarmament: A Role For A WE Aldermaston' by Tom\nMilne on 2 December at 1 pm.

If you go, you\nmay be forced to agree that it is the exhibition of the year. Amazing as a whole and yet every painting is special in its own right. The hype was:\nFive Russian (Natalia Goncharova, Luibov Popova, Olga R oz a nova, Varvara Step a nova, Nadezhda Udaltsova) and one Ukrainian (Alexandra\nExter) artist showing more than fifty paintings, many never before seen in\nthe West. We follow the careers of these artists in a sweep through the\nyears immediately before and after the 1 9 1 7 Revolution. I went in wanting to like this exhibition and came out in love. But there are just too\nmany fantastic pictures here and Iam struggling to describe them.\nApproach Olga Rozanova's Jack of Hearts and you think: she is copying\nPicasso. Then you read: painted about1912. Then you wonder: this\npainting would pass for a Picasso circa 1 9 6 0 . In 1 9 1 7 , R oz a nova painted Green Stripe (Colour Painting). This is purely abstract, reductive and almost unbelievably ahead of its time. Popova is equally impressive with\nher bold, dramatic, often abstract forms (Painterly Architectonics). These\nartists were so avant-garde that they foresaw the future of Western art. Its\nalmost as surprising as Queen Victoria predicting the internet, and then\nhaving her palace wired up for it.\nOf the six, Goncharova was the most dedicated painter (the others\nworked on theatre sets and textiles). She picked up Western influences\nand madly ran with them, producing pictures of quite striking originality.\nStarting in 1 9 0 7 with a beautifully executed Impressionist self-portrait\n(Self-Portrait with Yellow Lilies), she evolves effortlessly into a more futurist style (Pillars of Salt, 1 9 0 8 ) . Then, in a little over two years, she paints\nthe darkly-brooding masterpiece Apocalypse (Elder with Seven Stars),\nwhich could be contemporary art. So forward looking, it was considered\nblasphemous and caused a political storm at the time. Unperturbed, she\nspearheaded the Russian Cubo-Futurist movement, with pictures like The\nWeaver (Loom and Woman).\nBut the paintings are more than wonderful. Every one is a unique synergy of Western influence and Russian folk art. Goncharova takes the traditions of Russia and reinterprets them in pictures like Mowers, which has\nthe air of a medieval allegorical painting. Alexandra Exter painted in an\nabstract style but was forever interested in the traditional, classical representation of landscape, magically expressed in Cityscape (Composi-tion). Iam speechless!\nThe Art of Bloomsbury\nTate Gallery Nearest Tube: Pimlico\nUntil: 3 0 January 2 0 0 0\nGate crashing Thursday Night Cocktails at UCL Union. Is this your only\nBloomsbury Experience? If it is, Bloomsbury will not be a very evocative\nplace for you. After closing time, we all know that you need a junior doctor's stamina just to stand near those sloshed students sicking up and up and up. But having been a UCL undergraduate and sometime resident of Cartwright Gardens, I also know Bloomsbury for its leafy squares and graceful Georgian terraces: semi-mythical homeland of that famous collective of radical intellectuals known as the Bloomsbury Group. Within easy stumbling distance of UCL are the former houses of Virginia Woolf, John Maynard Keynes, EM Forster, Roger Fry, Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant. The last\nthree were artists and this new exhibition follows their interlinked careers\nfrom1910. Sadly, this exhibition inadvertently portrays Bloomsbury as a fossilised back water of artistic mediocrity. Although Roger Fry was the first to introduce\nImpressionism into the British art mainstream, most of his own work and that\nof Bell and Grant is, without doubt, incredibly dull and very much of its age. There were over a hundred archetypal Bloomsbury works( still-lifes, portraits)\nand some of them were distinctly third rate. Vanessa Bell's The Ha/s tack, As he ham is barely distinguishable from the poorly executed daubs of an\namateur. Yet others give the impression of boredom: imagine Vanessa Bell\nsitting around with nothing to do and desperately racking her brains for\nsomething' clever' to paint. In the background of Duncan Grant's Still Life\nWith Matisse, there is are production of Matisse' s Blue Nude I.I' m afraid to\nsay that Matisse, even in imitation, put everything else to shame. The tragedy is that there were only five really striking paintings in the entire\nexhibition. These were actually not all that wonderful and have been done elsewhere and better. Yet they were aesthetically pleasing and captivated me\neither by their intimacy with the subject ( Grant: Vanessa Bell at Charleston\nand Vanessa Bell Pregnant) or their vibrant warmth( Grant: The Doorway and South of France; Fry: View of Cassis).\nThe impact of this exhibition relies entirely upon its context. The Bloomsbury celebrity connection means that people handover money to see something that would be, under normal circumstances, firmly rooted in the second division (and Iam being charitable here). But, in spite of this, I couldn't help but\nfall into the celebrity trap and begin to like these pictures.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 William Burns William Burns\n\n"

The type of stud en to naC& G College degree is\nalso different to that of a student\nin any other constituency. C&G College students come, to Imperial with an A Level points average of almost29. This is over one point more than the average medic or scientist, and several\npoints more than the average miner. Because of the lucrative\nnature of the C&G College degrees, since they are orientated towards industry, C&G College students also earn more when they leave college than the average medic, scientist or miner.\nHence C&G College is distinctly\ndifferent to the other constituencies. \"When you enter industry,\nyour degree represents the Cordon Bleu of Engineering\" David Bishop, City & Guilds Coi ie ge Union President 1 9 6 5 / 1 9 6 6 .\nCity & Guilds College Union\nRe engineering The Way You Think\nCity & Guilds College Union( CGC U) is the student union for C&G College. As such, it represents this engineering portion of the students in Imperial College. Your academic year representatives are just one face of City &\nGuilds College Union. These students represent your interests at a local level in your degree, raising concerns in that year group. CGC U also has Departmental Representatives, who will raise\nissues which are not dealt with at\na local level, or those that affect a department as a whole. The CGC U Academic Affairs officer coordinates with the Depart men tal Representatives to raise matters insufficiently dealt with at a local level at the highest levels of\ncollege, and to bring to the fore\nissues that effect the C&G College engineers as a whole. Your Departmental Society is\nthe face of CGC U that you will\nsee on a more day today basis.\nThese societies represent the specific interests of your department socially as well as in arranging activities that are an extension of your degree. Extraordinary Societies such as the C&G Motor Club, C&G Rugby Club and Eestec provide opportunities to explore your engineering interests\nas a whole, or to become involved in representing the engineering identity of C&GC o ii eg e.CG CU also has strong links\nwith the CGC A, the corporate association of C&G College for past and present member of C&G College. The CGC A provides net-working opportunities the opportunity to meet and know people in industry and elsewhere.\" Having contacts\" has always been an excellent commodity in\nlife. Guild sheet is the student publication for CGC U, and as\nsuch provides a humourous alternative medium, reporting on the activities of CGC U as well as entertaining the C&G College students.\nOur events grow from strength to strength. Atlantis - The C&G Freshers Dinner, the annual hit extravaganza returns this\nweek, and future events are all set\nto be grade A standard. A taster,\nto give reassurance, is the London Boat Race in February, where Guilds face UCL, Kings and any other London college that wants\nto be involved in a massive100 pint Boat( drinking) Race. As a Union, we also aim to do more. In recent years we have added to our artillery of services.\nCGC U Buddies, the system for pairing up new fresher students\nwith older students from the department to help fresher s settle\ninto university life was a success in its pilot year on ISE and Civil Engineering, and is set to be expanded to the rest of C&G College for the next in take. The Internship Centre is in the CGC U production line, and will ultima t ely be a place where students see king summer vacation work can come by and apply for jobs relevant to their degrees. CGC U Active is the new \"society extension\" of the CGC U Executive Committee, allowing you to get involved in the particular running of a certain area of CGC U, as\nsuch allowing you to do more and getting more of what you want from CGC U. CGC U is a Union that is\nevolving to meet the needs of its\nstudents, and as the Millennium approaches, it will continue to become bigger and better. \" Ready to play a prominent part in the\nadvancement of the University\"\nGuilds Union, as described by\nThe Central in 1 9 1 0 .\n\n"

    "content": "15 November 1999 \u2022 Felix Games 25\nli ii ill l Flanker 2.0 (PC)\nFlight simulations are usually divided into two types\n- the mindless, arcade style affairs and the type that\ncomes with a manual four hundred pages long\nrequiring a degree in aeronautics and a private\npilots license to fly.\nFlanker 2 is supposed to fill the void between these\ntwo types - even without the manual I was in the air\nand shooting things down well enough after a few\nminutes. There are also various training missions\navailable in-game in which, and as a learning\nmethod they are extremely effective. The Flanker of\nthe game's title is the SU27, the latest, hardest\n(and probably biggest) Russian fighter plane. Iam told that because the Russian armed services do pretty much anything for money these days, the\ndevelopers were allowed access to all sorts of\ninformation on the plane that wouldn't have been\navailable if they'd chosen an American plane.\nWhether anyone but the most dedicated flight\nfanatic would notice the difference I doubt very\nmuch, however - when was the last time you actually flew an F16?I do think that perhaps this realism drive might\nhave gone a little far though - all the cockpit\nswitches are labelled in Russian only, which does\nnothing to enhance play ability. Indeed the whole\ngame seems to have been designed with a very\nRussian military design policy in mind: keep it sim-ple, build something that does the job and forget\nthe rest. Where it counts (ie around target areas)\nthe graphics are very detailed, but elsewhere they\nbecome blurry and lack colour depth. This means\nit runs extremely smoothly even on my old PC, something many other modern flight sims don't do. The emphasis is very much on the details of flying,\nnot on flashy eye-candy.\nHere's one example of the kind of mission in the\ngame: during one anti-ship mission I took out the\ncombat air patrol from long range and dove in on the target ship. Firing two sea-skimming missiles at\nit I turned for home on full afterburner, skimming\nthe waves at 1 3 0 0 kph. As I watched the missiles\nstreak target wards, two ship launched SAM S downed both of them, leaving me with no\nweapons and looking a right fool. Now that is\ndetail.\nIf you take the time to get beyond the initial training missions, this is a big game with loads of missions to play. The multiplayer section is well implemented and entertaining, although it lacks the personal combat touch of WorldWar II dogfighting\ngames. It is not a new benchmark in combat flight\nsimulations, but it's definitely up their with the best\nof them.\n\u2022 Ben\nThe most important fact about this game is that it's great fun to play. From the cutesy, squeaky cartoon\ncharacters to the very clear graphics, everything is\nenjoyable.\nA3D platform game along the lines of Mario64, Rayman 2 is definitely worth a try if you like that\nsort of thing. The storyline may be a bit weird at\ntimes, but then who really takes any notice of plots\nin games anyway? Basically, you play Rayman, a floppy-eared creature with no arms or legs - his\nfeet and hands just float around and have to save\nthe world by jumping around and collecting things.\nThe game eases you in gradually with a lot of easy\nlevels early on. With a bit of patience you'll soon get on to the more challenging and fun levels. This\nis certainly a big game, as I 've been playing for a week now and my score is still only 8 % . It's also\nrewarding, as you are always discovering new levels and special sections, not just frustrating ly walking round the same levels again and again loo king for the exit\nA fair bit of thought has obviously gone into the\nlevel design, and some of the puzzles and tricks are\nespecially cunning. They are also varied, not just\nthe endless repeating \"jump, walk, jump, shoot\" of\nmany 3 D platform games on the PC. The puzzles\naren't exactly brain-tax ers, never going beyond the\nstandard 'pull the switch to open the door1 kind\nreally, but you need pretty good coordination to\nget far. On the whole the camera angles are good, and you can always move the camera if you need\nto.\nThe graphics are well drawn and detailed, and the\nsound effects are suitably squeaky and cartoon\nlike. The music is bouncy and fun, with nice little\ntrills when you do something important. It's a little\nlike playing in one of those kids cartoons that are\non TV early Saturday morning. All in all, Rayman 2 is an extremely well polished\ngame. It may be a little childish, but if you treat it\nas a bit of a laugh and just play the game, it'll soon draw you in and have you hitting the keyboard in\ndisgust when you miss an easy jump and poor little Rayman plunges to his doom just before you\ncomplete the level.\n\u2022 Ben "
