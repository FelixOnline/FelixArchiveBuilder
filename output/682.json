Its rep e to ire is usually\nvery up to date with regard to\nthe many international festival\nfilms presently on tour, whilst\nstill reserving the late-nights\n(on Fridays and Saturdays for\nrespected cinema classic's( by contemporary standards).\nThe Screen On Baker Street\nis showing, from now until the\nend of the month, two such\n'classics'. Eraserhead, by\nDavid Lynch, is an amusing\nsatire on the surrealist films of\nthe 50's. Often (incorrectly)\nbilled as a grotesque and\nbizarre horror-movie, this\nblack and white film subtly\ntraces the domestic traumas\nof an average city-dweller,\nagainst Lynch's own interpretation of the oppressive\nenvironment in which he lives.\nKoyanisqaatsi, directed by\nFrancis Ford Coppola,\nessentially attempts the same\nthing, by using a collage of\nslow and fast film-clips to\nillustrate and compare our\nnatural and man-made\nenvironments. The word,\n'Koyanisqaatsi' stems from\nthe Hop i language, meaning'a crazy life that needs to be\nchanged'. Predictably, then,\nCoppola's visual statements\nare bound to be abstract and\nSo Little Red Riding Hood\nhits the big screen and\nencounters were-wolves, real\nwolves, Granny, and worst of\nall, men who's eye-brows\nmeet. And certainly our\nheroine, (Sarah Patterson),\ncopes with all of them and her\nrole admirably.\nThe film takes the format of\nstories told within the\nheroine's dream and uses\nconsiderable originality, a combination of poetic (or was\nit just plain ugly?) horror and\nfairy-tale fantasy, along with\nthe undertones (even if\ninconsistent) of our 13-year-old heroine's sexual awakening.\nNeil Jordan (the director),\nfills the film with some\nobtuse, but there is a lot of\nhumour in the film (not all of it\nintentional) and, whilst Philip\nGlass' accompanying orchestral work is uninspiring in\nparts, it adds greatly to the\nastounding visual effects that\nCoppola has captured on film.\nThe current trend in\nface lifting50' s kitsch\ncontinues unabated. In recent\nmonths we have seen our\nblack and while cinema\nheroes decked out in Dulux\nNon-Drip Video Glare with\nsoundtrack to match, whilst\nthe silents are given voice by\nsuch groups as CineChimera, an international jazz\ncompany, playing a series of\nimprovisations over anything\nfrom Hitchcock to Man Ray.\nNow comes 'Metropolis', the\n1984-remake by Giorgio\nMoroder of the science-fiction\nepic of 1926, directed by Fritz\nLang, but with a Dolby Stereo\nsoundtrack featuring artists\nsuch as Freddie Mercury, Pat\nBenatar and Adam Ant.\nUnfortunately this is not the\nfirst time this has happened.\nThe film has already been\nsubjected to James Brown\n(60's and free heavy funk form\njazz) from Cine-chimera, but\nthis latest assault on\nLangenstein's monster, whilst\ncertainly different, could put a stop to this sort of thing for\ngood. The film starts next\nweek at the Screen On The\nHill, NW3.\nsplendid visuals. Also, when\nJordan chooses to convert\ndreamy fantasy into stark\nhorror, he creates scenes,\nwith the help of Christopher\nTucker's special make-up\neffects, which leave you\nclutching your seat with your\neyes transfixed.\nThe film is satisfying,\nthough it lacks unity. The\nepisodes do not collate\ncomfortably nor are they all\nconsist ant to one theme, and\nthere is a problem with the\nscript. But on further\nreflection, you may think that\nall this doesn't matter very\nmuch, as the film is so\ncaptivating.\nKishor Patel\nThe Cars: Drive\nAn awful lot has changed\nfor the Cars, since 'Best\nFriend's Girl', with a new lead\nsinger, they also have a complete change of style.\n'Drive' is an excellently\nproduced track from a superb\nalbum unfortunately, after a while, this is boring.\nEverything But The Girl:\nNative Land\n'Each and Every One'\nshowed that an 'indie' style\nsong can be successful if\npromoted by a major label.\n'Native Land' is a similar piece;\nperhaps too similar. \"After a Freshers Week of almost zero\nsleep, I'm too tired to\nappreciate intellectual songs\nlike this. What's the point\nanyway? Music's meant to be\nfun.\nM&M: Cooling The Medium\n'Martha & The Muffins', now\nshortened to 'M&M', release\nthis second single from their\nalbum 'mystery walk'. It's undoubtedly not as good as\n'Black Stations, White\nStations' and comparing it to\n' Echo Beach' is like comparing Southside Refectory to the Cafe Royal. Still, IC\nRadio Megastar, Chris Martin,\nsays the B Side is brilliant.\nSome people have no taste!\nJulian Lennon: Too Late For\nGoodbyes\nJulian Lennon has almost\nas good a voice as his Father,\nalthough it lacks the hardened\nedge of classics like 'Give\nPeace A Chance'. Phil\nRamone has produced a sugary sweet song more\nreminiscent of 'Woman'. That\nmight be OK, but you have to\nremember at Julian's age,\nJohn Lennon was writing\n'Help' and 'Standing There',\nnot clever Radio 2 stuff like\nthis.\nFeargal Sharkey: Listen To\nYour Father\nThis is Feargal's first single\nsince 'Never Never\" with the\n'Assembly', and is of the same\nilk. I really don't know about\nthis one. It's a dead good song\nit's a probable hit, I just wish\nhe was still with the Undertones.\nThe Company of\nWolves\nLittle Red Riding Hood meets wolves, were-wolves and, worst of\nall, men whose eyebrows meet in the middle.\nFELIX Friday 12 October 1984 11\n\n"

    "content": "COPINION\nHAVE YOU thought about your grant? The first week of any term see\nlong lines of students queueing for what will be their lifeline in com in q weeks\u2014the grant cheque. This year many will find that their cheque\nis for less money than it was in previous years. Here Peter Burt\nconsiders the grant in a little more detail than most students usually\ndo.\nIn today's society it seems fair for everyone to\nexpect repayment for whatever work they may do.\nStudents in full-time education, however,\nobviously have no opportunity to earn a wage by\nworking regularly, although they are nonetheless\noccupied usefully and face the costs incurred in\nday to day living. These facts were recognized by\nthe Government of the day when University\neducation was expanded back in the early 1960's. The Education Act of 1962 made full time study a possibility by introducing 'duty' awards for degree\ncourses, and later expansion was also\naccompanied by provision of financial support for\nstudents.\nThe Government intends to spend \u00a3816 million\non student awards next year. Sadly, this element\nof expenditure is widely begrudged. The popular\nopinion is that students are a bunch of idle\nlay about s who are quite happy to sit around\nsponging money off the state. We frequently hear\nmuttering s that students should be forced to learn\nthe hard way by having to repay their grant money\nas a loan.\nThis shows us the amount of work which\nstudents (including yourself) must put into\nimprove their public image. However, it also gives\nan indication of the degree of misunderstanding\nabout grants which prevails outside Colleges,\nbecause in simple terms it can be argued that the\nstudent grant isn't really a handout from the state\nat all. A student who forgoes a wage for three years\nduring his course will obtain a qualification\nallowing him to get a job which, in most cases, will\nbe well paid and consequently taxed at a higher\nrate than average. The student will soon 'repay'\nthe money spent on his grant in this extra taxation.\nFurthermore, a system of grants represent, in the\nshort term, a much cheaper alternative than a system of loans for students. Although the present\nGovernment are 'ideologically attracted' to a loans\nsystem, they have concluded that the immediate\ncost of setting up such a system is prohibitively\nhigh, since large amounts of money will need to be\nspent before there can be any repayment of loans.\nIt is also generally accepted that introduction of\nloans could lead to a distortion in the range of\nsubjects studied. Although an engineer may be in a position to repay a loan relatively soon after\ngraduating, a student of theology, for instance, is\nunlikely to enter a well-paid job, and uncertainty\nabout the future may thus deter candidates from\nstudying such subjects.\nThe greatest benefit of a grants system is its\nimportance in encouraging people from a wide\nrange of backgrounds to participate in Higher\nEducation. There can be little doubt that, were\nthere no grant, only those who are particularly well\noff would be able to afford to study for degrees.\nThe importance of Higher education is obvious at\na time of rapid technological change and mass\nunemployment, and it makes sense for as many\npeople as possible to continue studying at this\nlevel.\nHOW THE GRANTS SYSTEM WORKS\nMost student grants are awarded by the Local\nEducation Authorities (LEAs), although some are\npaid from other sources, such as the Research\nCouncil \u2014 who deal with many postgraduate\ngrants.\nThe majority of IC students will be in receipt of\nwhat is know as a mandatory award, which is paid\nby their home LEA. Payment of mandatory awards\nis governed by statutory obligations, and providing\ncertain conditions are fulfilled awards are\nautomatically given to students. To qualify for a mandatory award, a student has to be ordinarily\nresident in the UK and must not have attended\ncertain courses in the past. A mandatory award\ncovers both tuition fees for the course and a maintenance grant. However, the maintenance\nelement of the award is subject to a means test,\nand the grant received by most students will be\ndependent on their parents' income. Mandatory\nawards are only attracted by certain designated\ncourses, which include full time degree courses,\nteacher training courses, and some other courses\nwhich are broadly equivalent to degree level.\nStudents who are not pursuing one of these\ncourses are still entitled to receive awards, but\nonly at the discretion of their LEA. However, since\n1975, when cuts in public expenditure began to\ntake effect, discretionary awards have drastically\ndecreased in both number and value. Local\nAuthorities are currect ly faced with particularly\nstringent financial curbs, and with the advent of\nrate-capping legislation discretionary awards seem\nset to disappear altogether.\nAs well as their grant, students are also entitled\nto other forms of support from the state. Students\nmay claim Housing Benefit on rents greater than\nthe ac como dati on allowance included in the grant\nand are allowed Supplementary Benefit over the\nsummer v action. RECENT CHANGES IN THE GRANTS\nSYSTEM\nThe tables below show how much money\nLondon undergraduates get in their grant, with a breakdown showing what the money is meant to\nbe spent on. Last year's figures are included for\ncomparison.\n1. MAIN RATES OF LONDON GRANT FOR\nMANDATORY AWARD HOLDERS.\n1983/4 1984/5\nStudent not at home\u00a31975 \u00a32100\nStudent living at home\u00a31275 \u00a31435\nMinimum Grant \u00a3410 \u00a3205\n2. BREAKDOWN OF LONDON GRANT\n\u00a31983/4 1984/5\nVacation (8 weeks) \u00a3196 \u00a3204\nBooks, equipment \u00a3173 \u00a3180\nTravel \u00a350* \u00a3100\nMiscellaneous \u00a3261 \u00a3271\nBoard and lodgings (30 weeks)\u00a31295 \u00a31347\nTotal maintenance grant \u00a31975 \u00a32100\n*As well as this, most students were entitled to\nclaim back travel spending above this figure in full.\nThe main rate of student grant was increased by\n4\n% for this year; an increase which was more or\nless in line with inflation (approximately 5%).\nHowever, the Department of Education and\nScience (DES) have managed with great cunning\nto save, in effect, \u00a320 million on student awards\nthis year. This has been done by halving the\nminimum award (paid this year to some 60,000\nstudents \u2014 20,000 more- that last year) and\nincreasing the parental contribution for students\nwhose parents have an annual income of over\n\u00a397,000. The DES have also made drastic changes\nin the system by which students are refunded their\ntravel costs. Prior to this academic year students\nwere entitled to claim back, within reason, the full\ncost of termly travel to and from their parents\nhomes and daily travel into college. But now a flat\nrate element is included within the grant of most\nstudents to cover travel costs, and those students\nwho have unavoidable high travel costs stand to\nlose out badly. As a result of all these changes a lot\nof IC students will find that their grant for this year\nis less than it was last year.\nHOW WILL THE CHANGES AFFECT\nSTUDENTS?\nAny reduction in funding affecting the student\ngrant will obviously lead to an eventual drop in\nliving standards for students. But there are other\nreasons to object to the changes.\nLast year's changes to the grants system had the\neffect of reducing the level of independence\nenjoyed by students. Increases in the parental\ncontribution mean that, unless a student is more\nthan 25 years old or has been at work for three\nyears before commencing a course, he or she will\nhave to scrounge even more money from parents\nin order to make the grant up to its full value.\nStudents up to the age of 25 years are financially\ntied to their parents through the parental\ncontribution in the grant, and, although the state\ntreats them as independent adults for all other\npurposes, their status in this respect is no more\nthan that of a child. Even Mr Peter Brooke, the\nMinister responsible for Higher Education, has\nbeen quoted as saying that he 'recognizes the\nill ogi city and unfairness of the parental\ncontribution'. The problem is compounded by the\nfact that 47% of all students are receiving less than\ntheir entitlement because their parents fail to make\nthe grant up to its full level.\nChanges to the systems of refunding travel and\nperhaps housing costs are particularly worrying. A recent survey on student costs of living concluded\nthat 'The contribution of items like rate rebates\nrent allowances and especially travel cost\nreimbursement are of great importance to a number of students.' But this is not the only effect.\nInstitutions, as well as students, seem to be\nworried about what may happen as a result of cuts.\nBecause there is very little housing suitable for\nstudents close to some Colleges, students are\nforced to commute daily to and from their classes.\nSuch students will end up being out of pocket\nunder the new 'flat rate' arrangements. As a result\nsome Universities, such as those at Warwick,\nLancaster, Kent, and London \u2014 all of which have a shortage of student accommodation on the\ncampus \u2014 may well fail to attract bright students,\nwho would effectively face a cut in grant due to\nunavoidably high daily travel costs. Indeed, the\nVice-Chancellor of the University of London has\nexpressed his 'deep concern' that the new method\nof refunding travel costs will ca sue 'serious\ndamage' to our University. The anticipated\nrevision to Housing Benefit payments for students\nwill only make things worse due to the expense of\naccommodation in London.\nHOW TO PROTECT YOUR GRANT\nDespite its flaws, the system of paying student\ngrants in the UK is one of the best in the world.\nNevertheless, it is generally recognized that the\nsystem contains potential il logic and unfairness for\nall its merits. Because of reductions in public\nspending, this il logic and unfairness seems set to\nbecome far more pronounced.\nStudents must accept that, in the short term, it\nis unrealistic to expect any improvements in the\ngrants system. We must instead direct our\nenergies to preventing further erosion of the grant\nand pointing out the long term benefits to\neveryone of investment in education. The aim of\nthis article is not to scare monger, but to point out\nthe very real threat facing students over the next\nfew years. Student grants are a soft target for\nspending cuts since students have little muscle\nwith which to oppose them and because they are\nfrequently seen as an extravagant item of\nexpenditure. After all is said and done, students\nare at present virtually alone in putting the case for\ngrants. No-one else will lift a finger to stop cuts in\nthe grant, so if you don't like such cuts it's up to\nyou to oppose them.\nDON'T TAKE YOU GRANT FOR\nGRANTED.\nPS If you have any problems concerning your\ngrant, Student Services, at 15 Princes\nGardens, will be pleased to offer assistance.\n12 Friday 12 October 1984 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "TN1EWS\nAnother\ncock-up,\nChristine?\nUnion clubs and societies will\nhave their budgets cut as the\nresult of an oversight by last\nyear's ICU Deputy President,\nChristine Teller. At yesterday's Union Finance Committee\n(UFC) the present Deputy\nPresident, Dave Parry, reported\nthat officers had overestimated\nthe Union's income by \u00a36500.\nWhen the Union presented its\nclaim to Governing Body it asked\nfor a9% increase in its\nsub vent ion. This comprised a3.8% general rise to account for\ninflation and \u00a36500 to cover the\nextra costs of affiliation to the\nUniversity Athletics Union\n(UAU). College agreed to this\nrise and told the Union that the\nsub vent ion, including the U AU money, was to be \u00a3228,750.\nUnfortunately the sabbatical\nofficers misinterpreted this and\nthought that the amount did not\ninclude the \u00a36,500 which they\nbelieved to be seperate.\nMr Parry warned major subcommittee chairmen, who are\nresponsible for clubs' finances,\ntheir claims would have to be\nre asses ed. He also warned that\ncontingency awards could only\nbe made in cases of real\nemergency.\nThis error is the third made by\nMiss Teller which has been\nrevealed since she left College.\nFreshers' FELIX reported that\nICU Council had not been asked\nto approve the annual estimates\nlast year as required by the Union\nBy-Laws. Had this been done it is\npossible the over estimate of\nUnion income would have come\nto light earlier.\nMiss Teller also cut the\nPostgraduate Group's grant\nfrom \u00a3560 to \u00a3100 for the year\nwithout consulting the PG Chairman, Chris Hendy. This\nwas despite the fact that Mr Hendy had told Miss Teller that\nas the Group had plans for\nincreased activity it would\nrequire at least the same level of\nfunding that it received in\nprevious years. This mistake was\nrectified at yesterday's UFC when a motion provisionally\ngiving the PG Group a budget of\n\u00a31000 was passed.\nClimbing wall for IC?\nPlans to build a climbing wall for\nIC students are going ahead after\na year's delay. The project, likely\nto cost about \u00a35000, will provide\nopportunity for mountain-climbing practice, and will be\nonly the second of its kind in\nLondon. The Queensgate Trust\nwill provide the money for\nbuilding the wall.\nThe climbing wall, which is to\nbe situated behind Weeks Hall,\nwill be made of pre-fabricated\nconcrete bolted to a steel frame,\nall assembled on site. It will\nconsist of a central concrete slab,\nwith two peripheral 'cracks'. A belay rail will run along the top,\nand a ladder will be provided\nadjacent to the wall.\nThe plan is to use the sunken\ngarden at the back of Weeks.\nThis will allow the use of the wall\nto be confined to students, as\nthey will have to go through the\nHall to get access. For safety\nreasons student s will not be\npermitted to climb alone.\nPlanning permission is soon to\nbe sought from Westminister\nCity Council. The present plans\nhave been drawn up by IC\nEstates Section.\nA similar wall built at Brunei\nUniversity led to two students\nfalling to their death, soon after it\nwas built.\nPROPOSED POSITION\nOF CLIMBING WALL\nBode m WooleiM\nThose of you who have had\noccasion to use the new\ntelephone system can not have\nfailed to notice that so far it's been suffering from more than a few 'teething problems'.\nInstruments which have been\nworking okay suddenly go dead,\nothers have yet to be connected at\nall. Conversations can be cut off\nin the middle for no apparent\nreason, one-way communication\ncan occur when making a call \u2014\nyou can hear them, but they can't hear you!. The installation of the\nnew system has hardly been a great advertisement for British\nTelecom's wonderful new\nequipment.\nBut at least part of the blame\nfor the disruption must lie with\nthe College rather than BT.\nDuring the first few weeks of the\nnew system's operation when an\nincoming call was lucky enough\nto get through to the\nswitchboard, the operators\nseemed to have no idea about\nwhich extension to connect it to.\nClearly they should have had a list of old external, numbers\nagainst new numbers as well as a list of new numbers against the\nname of the person or office to\nwhich they belong. Such lists are\navailable on the exchange's computer, but were no-where\nnear complete at the time the new\nsystem came into operation. And\nthe parts of the list that were\nready contained numerous\nerrors. For example, during the\nfirst two weeks or more many\ncalls to the Union Office were put\nthrough to the Crush Bar phone\nwhich is situated on the second\nfloor landing of the central\nstaircase in the Union Building.\nI'm sure that in a few months\ntime when everything's working\nsmoothly the new system will be a great improvement on the old\nexchanges, but at the moment it's a standing joke (even used by the\nRector at the Fresher s' Reception). More seriously, it's also a cause of great inconvenience, and em baras s ment to everyone who's had to\napologise to an incoming caller\nfor the time they've wasted in\ngetting through. Noone involved in organising the\nchangeover comes out of it with.\nmuch credit.\n16 Friday 12 October 1984 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "EREVIEWS:\nBOOKS\nDown and Out: Orwell's London and Paris Revisited by\nSandy Craig and Chris\nSchwarz (Penguin)\nThis is one of the most\ngripping books of social\nconflict that I have ever read. It\nis an alarming and worrying\nrecord of homelessness that\nshould not be ignored.\nThe photographs that are\nfor some obscure reason\nplaced at the rear of the book,\nare some of the best black and\nwhite photographs that I have\never seen. They show the\nalarming conditions in which\nmany single people live. There\nis no attempt to create any\nhappy smiling tramps with\nthere posses ions in a handkerchief on the end of a rod. These photographs instead remove any illusions\nabout the romantic tramp one\nmight of had. This review of\nthe photographs may seem a little over the top but they are\nsimply superb. If you don't want to buy it then Ire com end that you go down to your local\nbookshop and just look at\nthese photographs.\nAlthough the text is and\ncould be as instantly interesting as the photo-graphs, it is still a masterly\npiece of journalism. The\nintroduction gives a few of the\nfacts about the homeless in\nthis country so that one gets\nsome idea of the scale of the\nproblem. However this is not,\nand doesn't attempt to be, a complete survey of the\nproblem. Instead it is a series\nof short stories about the\nhomeless interspersed with\nsome of Orwell's original\nwritings. These stories are\nmoving in that one can often\nsee how, had the circumstances been different one\ncould have ended up in the\nstreets. This is no exaggeration because many of these\npeople have come from the\nmiddle classes like me, and I guess you. They have been to\nordinary schools and they\nhave been brought up by\nordinary parents.\nBy this time you are probably thinking that these homeless are just a bunch of\nscroungers and lay about s. Some of them are, but many of\nthem despise handouts and\ndesperately look for jobs. This\nbook removes a lot of illusions\nabout people taking advantage of the welfare state.\nIf you are one of blinkered\nsort of people who believe that\neveryone has opportunities\nand that people create there\nown problems you should\nprobably ignore the text and\njust look at the photos. Carry\non living in your ivory tower\nand sweeping social problems\nunder the carpet (sorry about\nthe clich es). However if you\nwant to be challenged to\nimprove the situation why not\ngo our and buy it.\nOne slight criticism, after all this praise, about the timing.\nWhy did it have to be launched\nin 1984 when it will be lost in\nthe Orwell overkill.\nAshes in the Mouth: The Story\nof the Body-Line Tour 1932-33 by Ronald Mason\n(Penguin)\nEver since David Putman\nannounced that the sequel to\nChariots of Fire would be a film about Bodyline, the\ninterest in the test series has\nrisen enormously. Already\nthere have been several books\non the subject and an\nAustralian TV series. This\nbook is the best of the books\non this subject I 've read,\nhowever it is definitely aimed\nat cricket fans.\nThe un in it i a ted are probably already wondering\nwhat the Bodyline Bowling\nseries was anyway. It was a series of cricket tests in which\nan English side lead by\nDouglas Jardine defeated an\nAustralian side using a tactic\nknow as bodyline. The Australians objected to it as\nthey considered that it\ninvolved the English bowling\nat their batsmen's bodies. The\nEnglish considered it\nlegitimate as the laws of\ncricket didn't ban it. That\nprobably hasn't explained it\nvery well but if you want to\nfind out more there are plenty\nof histories of cricket that\nexplain it fuller.\nBack to the review. This isn't the book for the. uninitiated\nbecause it assumes too\ndetailed a knowledge of\ncricket. For example if you\ndon't know who Harold\nLarwood is you might become\na little confused.\nTo the cricket fan, though, it\nis a godsend. It is an informed\nbut almost totally unbiased\naccount of the series. It is well\nwritten and clear. The one\nthing it lacks is a few of the\nanecdotes that give a cricket\nbook life. In the introduction\nMr Mason says that he\ninterviewed many of the\nsurvivors of the series and it is\na pity that he couldn't have\nused their anecdotes. Ire com end it as a good buy for\nany cricket fans.\nHugh Southey\nA photograph from Down and Out showing Mr Good in front of\nthe 8' by 4' cubicle he lived in for fifteen years.

The records\nstopped jumping, more people started going,\nand some even danced and then it was the\nend of term so it had to stop.\nAnd so to this year, Lounge Lizzards\nopens again, with a new name \u2014 'The\nLounge', a new disco, an,d the intention, at\nleast, to play music that is not only dance able but recognisable. On the opening night \u2014\nthis Saturday \u2014 the Lounge will play host to\na new band Calendar Crowd, who have been\ngenerating a great deal of interest on the\nLondon circuit, and after that the disco will\ntake over until the early hours of the\nmorning.\nWith an opening night like that, how can it\nfail? Well come along and see...\nWELLSOC\nAll in the mind?\nWhat are the powers of the mind? Aside from\nthe obvious ones, other so called sixth-senses have been suggested. Of these\ntelepathy is probably the best known. This is\nthe process by which two people can\ncommunicate without any other means\nexcept that of the mind. Clairvoyance, also\nknown as remote viewing, is another\nfrequently suggested ability. This allows\npeople to 'see' distant objects while in a closed room. A series of experiments at\nPrinceton University have produced some\nexciting results in this area, and were\nfeatured in a recent Horizon program.\nPerhaps the most dramatic power\nsuggested is that of psychokinesis.\nThis week Wellsoc will investigate the\npowers of the mind with the excellent help of\nauthor and comedian Michael Bentine.\nPerhaps more famous for his part in the early\nGoon Shows and his invention of the\nchildrens televison stars The Potties,\nMichael Bentine has been involved in\nparapsychology for many years. He has\nwritten a number of books on the subject as\nwell as presenting a large number of talks.

This horribly disfigured man,\nwho appeared as a circus freak for many\nyears, was rescued from his degradation s by\na Professor from the London Hospital. The\nhead of Pathology from the same hospital will\ntell us the true story of the Elephant Man at\n7.30pm on Monday 15 October in Physics\nLecture Theatre 1.\nAll in all its a big week for Wellsoc.

    "content": "CFEUX\nfEU X nX SHEL QS* WOEIK\nIPIH\u20acT \u20ac\nCOMEDY\nNear disaster was averted last\nweek as the main band at the\nFresher's Ball were unaware of\nthe event until four hours before\nthe start. Despite being contacted\ntwo months in advance, the\nagency who booked the group,\nMisty in Roots, forgot to remind\nthem of the gig. Inspite of this\ncrisis Freshers week was deemed\na complete success by Ents\nchairman, Dave Allen as well as\nthe sabbatical officers. The profit\nfor the week was about \u00a31000,\nslightly higher than expected and\nfor the first time in a number of\nyears there were no complaints\nfrom the Police or local residents.\nThe week started, not\ns uprising ly, on Monday with the\ntraditional New Year's party.\nThis event attracted about 800\npeople and featured an excellent\nconcert by the Higsons.\nOn Tuesday night the ever\npopular Life Sciences party took\nplace in the J CR. This was\nreported even fuller then usual\nwith music provided by the Ents\ndisco. The only serious casualty\nwas a window in one of the doors.\nThursday nights' films The\nHunger and Brainstorm did not\nattract as many people as\nanticipated. This could have been\nbecause some Freshers may not\nhave realised that their \u00a38 week\nticket entitled them to free entry.\nThe highlight of the week was\nthe Fresher's Ball on Friday,\nhowever it came close to being a complete disaster. The main\nproblem was that Misty in Roots,\nthe star attraction did not know\nthey had a gig until four o 'clock\non that Friday afternoon. An additional problem was the\nabsence of aPA system.\nFollowing frantic phone calls the\nband were assembled and a small\nbut suitable PA obtained leading\nto only a slightly delayed opening\nto the Ball.\nThe event attracted about 800\npeople who packed out the two\ndiscos and concerts by Rent\nParty, the popular jazz band and\nof course Misty in Roots who\nwent down very well despite\nbeing virtually unprepared.\nSeveral films were also shown\nthroughout the night. Apart\nfrom a few attempts to climb in\nthrough windows there was no\ntrouble and on the whole the\nFreshers Ball was an enjoyable\nevent for everyone.\nThe temptation when reviewing comedy acts is to\ntry and be funny. Suffice to\nsay (for those who went), I was the easy-rider motorbike.\nIntrigued? Read on...\nThe evening went off with a semi-fizz, going by the name\nof Rory Bremmer whose deft if\nnot daring 'man-of-many-faces' act left me pretty cold\nbut got tr re audience warmed\nup for things to come.\nScene II brought the amazing 'Skint Video' whose\nlyrical Smiths take-off\u2014The\nJones (plus bay leaves in the\nback pocket) and an adroit\nSpringsteen number'Hereyes\nwere running ...down her\nneck' a radioactive ballad,\nIII L NIGHT were spot-on. With a little\nvoice training these boys will\ngo far.\nThe amber nectar during\nthe break brought out of the\nwoodwork what was to prove\na most profound and worthwhile poet-comedian,\nJohn Hegley. He didn't say\nan thing particularly funny for\nthe twenty minutes he was on,\nbut this devastating cynicism\nand mundane observational\npoetry brought more laughs\nand spontaneous applause\nthen the rest put together.\nHis book 'Visions of the\nBone Idol' is well worthwhile\nfor anyone who is bored of\nreading train-tickets.\nLast came the act that I assume everyone had been\nwaiting for ' The Vis cio us Boys', winners of the 1984\nTime Out street entertainers\nfestival. This pair are now\nlocally famous, neigh, nationally famous since their\nslow-motion 'Chariots of Fire'\nappeared on the box.\nThey are amusing, its no\ngood denying that, but they\nenjoy themselves too much.\nToo many of their sketches\nfell flat. When I first saw them\nin Convent Garden I thought\nthey were verging on the\n'visionary', but I'm not sure\nfame and bringing the a qt on\nto the stage has done a lot for\nthem.\nI hope that in a couple of\nmonths I 'll be able to stumble\nacross them again in Convent\nGarden, doing something\nelse, just as original.\nAt the start someone yelled\n'I'm gonna laugh even if it kills\nme'. There were no corpses\nleft lying around at the end, so\nI assume he didn't find it too\nhard. There is no doubt that\nthe evening was a success.\nJonathan Wonham\nShoppers in trendy Covent Garden were sup rise d to find a bunch of\nlay about s from Guilds Union there last Saturday. However, always\nfriendly and welcoming, the to ffs responded with custard pies in the\nface! Fortunately they also responded with cash. City and Guilds\nUnion raised over \u00a380 for IC Rag from their efforts during Freshers'\nWeek.\n4\nFriday 12 October 1984 FELIX\n\n"

This follows a report in last week's FELIX dealing with the problems with the fire alarm system.\nThe alarms started going off at\nabout 6.00pm Saturday and by\nmidnight had gone off fourteen\ntimes. These alarms are believed\nto have been caused by residents\ncooking in their rooms.\nAt about 6.30am on Sunday\nthe alarms went off again. This\ntime it was caused by a smoker in\nthe IC Radio studio. The\nstudents present in the studio\nworried that security guards\nturned the bells off without\ncoming to check on the reason\nfor the alarm. It is unusual for the\nIC Radio studio to be in use at the\ntime of the alarm, and the room\ncontains a lot of electrical\nequipment. Station Manager\nPeter Coleman felt that the alarm\ncould well have been genuine and\nthat the matter should have been\ninvestigated at the time.\nSecurity Officer, Geoffrey\nReeves, is now investigating as to\nwhy. the alarm was apparently\nignored.\nIn a further incident yesterday\nmorning the fire alarms in the\nBeit Building went off. An intruder alarm was recently\ninstalled in the animal room in\nZoology. Those legitimately\nentering the room have nine\nseconds to cancel the alarm\nbefore it goes off. A user of the\nroom failed to cancel the alarm in\ntime. It seems that this intruder\nsystem has been connected to the\nfire alarm system, and it was\ntaken to be a fire alarm by most\nof those in the building.\nRector to\naddress CBI\nA Confederation of British\nIndustry (CBI) Conference is to\nconsider the problems of lack of\nco-operation between universities and industries.\nLord Flowers, Rector of IC, is\nto speak at the conference,\ntogether with Sir Terence\nBeckett, Director General of the\nCBI, and Sir Keith Joseph,\nSecretary of State for Education\nand Science\n\u2014RAG\u2014\nTiddlywinking\nOxford Street\ndown\nRaise money for Rag,\nand get pissed at the\nPresident's expense!\nMeet at C CU Offices\nat 9am on Saturday\nmorning.\nDr Death at IC\nThe Rt Hon Dr David Owen MP, leader of the Social\nDemocratic Party, spoke to a capacity audience in the\nGreat Hall on Tuesday.\nDr Owen, invited by IC SDP Society, spoke for about\ntwenty minutes and then answered numerous questions\nfrom the floor.\nDr Owen was Labour Foreign Secretary under Jim\nCallaghan but became a founder member of the SDP in\n1981.\nFree!

    "content": "Adams\ngives\nLecture\nRichard Adams, the author of\nWatership Down was the guest\nspeaker at the first of this years\nWellsoc lectures.\nHe was presented to the floor\nby Dr Sinclair Goodlad who, for\nthe benefit of newcomers gave an\nintroduction to the society as well\nas speaking of some of the\nsubjects covered in previous\nyears which included an over\nenthusiastic explosives expert as\nwell as the pioneering laser\ndisplay.\nMr Adams, a civil servant until\nhe retired recently, displayed a lively sense of humour launching\ninto a discourse, that at times was\nmost passionate, on the topic of\nrelationships between man and\nanimals.\nIn a well marshalled a rgu ment he first drew attention\nto the scale of mans destruction\nof the environment with a catalogue of biological woe. The\nmain causes of this were isolated\nas being the huge population\nincreases and the advances in the\nfield of weaponry. It was held by\nMr Adams morally indefensible\nthat man should inflict suffering\nand death merely because he has\nthe power to do so. As far as\nother species are concerned it\nwould be best if man were to\ndisappear from the face of the\nearth, he said.\nFollowing this there was a discussion on the foundations of\nour society. The Greeks were\ncredited with the inventing of\nthought and reasoning, the\nRomans with the supremacy of\nlaw, the Jews with ethics and\nJesus with compassion. The way\nin which these elements affect our\nlife in general and attitude to\nanimals in particular was\nexamined.\nIt was concluded that if we, as\nhumans, exploit animals for our\nown advantage, it must follow\nfrom our compassion that the\nmini mun suffering possible is\ninflicted. It was also stated that\nthe killing of any creature for any\nreason other than absolute need\nis morally wrong. Ironically, it\ncame to light during the\ndiscussion that Mr Adams does\nin fact fish.\nRowing\nPeru\nThere will ba a challenge for an\nImperial College cox ed four\nwhen on Sunday 14 October they\nwill do a sponsored row from\nHenley-upon-Thames to Putney\nembankment.\nThis fifty mile 'Sunday outing'\nwill include seventeen locks just\nto add a bit of light relief. The\naim of the row is to raise money\nfor the boat club and funds to\nenable Val Snewin (who\ngraduated in Biochemistry this\nJune) to go on Operation\nRaleigh.\nOperation Raleigh is a four\nyear expedition round the world,\nupon which Val has been offered\na place as Microbiologist for the\nfirst year. She will be based on\nboard the research vessel in\nNorth, Central and South\nAmerica.\nThe costs involved are \u00a310 a day and after vigorous fund\nraising and working in a lab for\nthree months, Val is hoping to\nraise some of the remaining \u00a3700\nNEWS!\naway to\nshe needs by rowing on Sunday.\nThose rowing on Sunday are\nJohn Griffiths (ICBC\nMen's Captain), Val Snewin,\nKim Winslet (ICBC Ladies'\nCaptain) and Eugene Mendez\n(ICPG).\nAnyone who is interested in\nsupporting this event, would they\nplease contact Kim Winslet (Life\nSci 111 letter racks).\nLobby\nA group of IC students is to\nlobby MPs in the Houses of\nParliament on October 24.

    "content": "[\"FEATURE FEATURED\nFour Weeks in August\nDramsoc at the Fringe\nOn Saturday August 4th Mr Matthew Chevassut, the Dramsoc\npresident, boarded the overnight London to Edinburgh coach,\nequipped with a change of socks and a bottle of vodka. At\napproximately 6.30am Sunday morning he stumbled wearily from\nthe coach clutching in one hand his socks and in the other an empty\nvodka bottle. The 1984 tour to the Edinburgh Fringe had begun....\nThis was Dramsoc's fourth Edinburgh tour, and\nfor the second year the society was running a fringe venue as well as producing four shows of its\nown, under the touring name of 'Beit Theatre'. In\nall about 40 members were involved, many of\nwhom were concentrating on acting, but there was\nalso a large and highly experienced technical\ncontingent. In fact it is chiefly in the technical and\nadministrative departments that a tour to the\nEdinburgh Festival Fringe represents a particularly acute workload; preparations for the\nsummer were already underway at the start of the\nprevious autumn term. For the majority of the\ntouring party, however, 'Edinburgh' began as soon\nas their summer exams had finished; in not much\nmore than six weeks all four shows had to be\nbrought to performance standard. For most of the\nactors this meant four or five evenings per week\nwere spent at rehearsals. There was also a vast\namount of work to be done designing and building\nsets, collecting props and arranging the lighting\nand sound effects. As well as this, posters and\nprogrammes for four shows had to be prepared.\nBefore anyone had time to forget a line, it seemed,\nAugust had arrived, and with it a forty-ton truck\nfull of things theatrical departed for the north.\nThe first week in Edinburgh was spent in\nfrenzied activity as the Dramsoc die-hard s( advance party) struggled to convert St John's church hall into a venue fit for three weeks of\n'Po' cast, somewhere on the District Line\nSara Holmes-Woodhead tempts gambler Mike\nBridgeland with a glass of lemonade\nalmost non-stop theatre. 'Setting up' involved\nerecting a considerable amount of scaffolding,\nfixing tabs to most of it, hanging upwards of eighty\nstage lights, building a banked seating area and an\nawful lot more there isn't room to list. The\nresponsibility of running the venue dictated that\nsomeone always had to be on hand to supervise\nthe other groups who were using the theatre, with\nthe result that a few of the society's martyrs never\nseemed to leave the church.\nOn the whole, none of our own productions\nwere received as well as had been hoped; there\nwas certainly no show which achieved the same\noutstanding success as the previous year's 'What\ndo you say before you say goodbye?\nOf the two main productions, which ran on\nalternate nights, 'The Gambler' did slightly better\nin terms of audience figures. The play was an\nadaptation, by the director Dave Wheatley, of the\nnovel by Dostoyevsky. Unfortunately the press\nreaction (particularly important for small\ncompanies at the Fringe) was no more than\nmoderate. The Scotsman in particular contented\nitself with pointing out that the play lacked the\ndepth of the novel (hardly surprising, since it had\nto be condensed into a one hour performance). It\nwas encouraging to receive some more\nconstructive comments from the general public.\nThe parallel production, 'Po', seemed to\npolarize the reviewers. The play was written by ex-IC student Graham Brand, directed by Adam\nTandy and was set in futuristic London. In the\nFestival Times it received this glowing accolade;\n'Po is a new play written by Graham Brand and\na very good one too. Set after the next war has\nbroken out, in a deserted London, it examines the\nold problem of the release of 'savage' instincts\nwhen the existing society breaks down. The\nemphasis on the spirit of the city is a change from\nthe normal approach, and is refreshing and\nsuccessful. The acting is of a high quality and is\nexcellently cast.'\nRadio Forth, on the other hand, carp ingly commented;\n'...a sound idea, but the script hasn't enough\nimpetus to carry the show, says Festival City\nRadio reviewer Aubrey Dickson. The actors don't help things along and the end result is a complete\nmishmash. Try to miss it.'\nThe other two Dramsoc shows were both\ndirected by ageing duo Nick Moran and Ross\nDarling. 'Piggies in the Middle' by John Ashby was\na childrens play with music and attracted several\nappreciative afternoon audiences.\n'Derek' by Edward Bond was the only play\nwt it ten by an established play right, and had been\nconsidered a safe bet, at least as a crowd-puller.\nSurprisingly, Bond's blatantly left-wing political\nthemes did not go down well with the pressmen.\nOn this point, however, you will get the chance to\njudge for yourselves as there will be three 'post-Edinburgh' performances of Derek in two weeks\ntime (Thurs 18th to Sat 20th). Don't miss it; the\nplay is an excellently constructed piece of theatre.\nIn general, despite the rather indifferent\nreception of our work, Edinburgh was a very\nworthwhile experience, and an exciting way to\nspend the summer. Anyone interested in joining\nDramsoc might like to consider taking part in next\nyear's tour. For the moment, however, there are\nworkshops on Wednesday afternoons at 2.30pm, or why not just pop along to the Dramsoc\nstoreroom any lunchtime?\nBig Business?\nJohn Burgess looks at the funds for the festival\nEntrepreneur Jeff Morris and his masseur Dave\nHarrison in 'Piggies'\n'What Festival?' We didn't know there was\none. It's a coincidence that we're here to see\nthe Castle at the same time. I thought the city\nwas pretty busy when we couldn't find a space\nfor the car. So who pays for this Festival of\nyours? Big business?'\nEach year, at the height of the summer, the city\nof Edinburgh prepares to face the crowds of\nloathsome Americans, excitable Italians and\nBritish culture vultures (sporting tweed jackets or\n'Frankie..' T shirts) for the three week long\nInternational Festival. Many of its visitors are\nperformers, many more are simply s pact at or s, but\nall the Festival's patrons have, to some extent,\ncome away with the impression that, this year at\nleast, the whole affair is becoming quite over-rated.\nIn the month leading up to the Festival,\nEdinburgh District Council cleans the streets,\n('cleansing' the Council calls it), hangs coats of\narms down Princes's Street, dons as many tartans\nas it shelves can stock and becomes Mother\nScotland for a month. 'Balmorality', is how Dr\nJonathan Miller, the new chairman for the Fringe,\ndescribes it. 'Scotland has been a sort of arena on\nwhich the English project colourful romantic\nfantasies. The awful thing is the way the Scot's accept it. All this plaid and wee drams and\nheather.'\nA glance through the official programme\nconfirms it. One of the centre pieces of the Festival,\nSir David Lyndsay's 'Ane Satyre of the Thrie\nEstates'is transformed from a16 th century\nmorality play into a spectacle 'full of action, music\nand song'. 'It's never been done before', said its\ndirector, Mr Owen Dudley Edwards, 'After all they\nsay about the poor old Festival, this is one of these\nthings we do not have the facilities or the money to\ndo at any other time. During the Festival we can do\nit and afford a cast of this magnitude and quality'.\nThe Fringe Festival too lacks much original\nScottish theatre. There are some notable\nexceptions,such as Graeae Theatre's 'FizzPunchFlipFlingZombie Sidecar Pick-Me-Up',\nan exceptional cabaret performed by an\nalarmingly frank disabled theatre troupe. Apart\nfrom these however the programme is bleak: kilts\nand Ceilidh, Burns and bagpipes all serve to\nremind us that the Festival is a showcase for\nBritish talent and Scotland is our host.\nNot that the city is complaining. Well, not too\nmuch anyway. For the Edinburgh Trader's Association, the Festival is a time to make lots of\nmoney. The Tartan Kilt Shop on Prince's Street\nhangs a sign which reads 'If Your Name Is Here\nThen We Stock Your Tartan', (the list is\nimpressively long); street corner bakeries stock\nscotch pies (at a 'Festival Price!'); scalding hot,\nunglazed pastry filled with petrified Kit-E Kat;\nhighland dancing takes place in the gardens below\nthe Castle, and the be-bagpipe d Rev Cameron\nbus ks and bible-beats the confused passers by\nwith a voice louder than the city's traffic.\nThe real losers during the Festival, however,are\nthe visiting theatre companies themselves. This\nyear, the cost of hiring Edinburgh's top venues\nhave soared. The largest venue on the Fringe\n'Assembly Productions, forked out \u00a320,000 for the\nAssembly Rooms in George St, 20% more than\nthey paid last year. Little wonder that ticket prices\nhere were well in excess of \u00a33.00. The Circuit, an\nextraordinary network of marquee-tents situated\nin a large bomb-crater, a mile south of Edinburgh's West End, did not appear in the Fringe listings this\nyear. The land has been bought by the Lyric\nTheatre who are holding it for further\ndevelopment. The Transport Hall, admittedly not\nin Central Edinburgh, but with as much potential\nand capacity as the Assembly Rooms was\noccupied by just one principal company, the\nOxford University College Players, who put on\nnine shows to make the lease worthwhile. 'We've\nreached a critical point', said Mr William BurdettCoutts, Artistic Director for Assembly\nProductions, 'in future, we must have more\nfunding from local authorities, from the Arts\nCouncil and from sponsorship'.\nBut the Scottish Arts Council, doubtless aware\nof the increasingly English flavour of the Festival\nhas cut back heavily on its funding. According to\nMr Timothy Mason, Director of the Scottish Arts\nCouncil, 'our priorities lie necessarily with\norganisations which offer employment and\nentertainment 52 weeks a year rather than with a three week event. The Festival was an obvious\narea for change.' Little funding is available from\nEdinburgh District Council or from commer ical sponsors either. The Labour leader for the\nCouncil, Mr Alex Wood, described the Festival\nSociety as 'a self-selecting society of academic and\ncultural elite'. Commercial companies,\napprehensive moneylenders at the best of times,\nfeel they have gone as far as they can in the way of\nsponsorship; both the Fringe and the Jazz Festival\nwere heavily subsided this year.\nThe position seems to have reached a stalemate. The larger promoters require a profit to\nstage their shows next year and have had to book\nmany established artists to ensure a full house.\nIndependant and university groups, although\ngenerally self-sufficient, rely heavily on big names\nfrom whom to tap their audience, and they too will\nstage established and traditional theatre; the\nfestival turns into a variety show. Nevertheless\nsomeone's ve iw s will have to change if the larger\nvenues are to cope next year, though there are\nsome who hope they do not.\nSean Macrae, Mike Bridgeland and Nikki Scott at the roulette table\nFriday 12 October 1984\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURED\nMoney off your rent\nAt the beginning of April 1983 the 'Unified\nHousing Benefit' system came into full\noperation across the UK. This system\nreplaced the old rent and rate rebate scheme\nand removed responsibility for meeting\nhousing costs for those on supplementary or\nunemployment benefit from the DHSS to the\nlocal housing authorities.\nThe scheme introduced two new types of\nhousing benefit and a bureaucratic\nnightmare that has kept Town Halls in\nturmoil for over a year.\n1 Certified Housing Benefit and Housing\nBenefit Supplement\nThese benefits are only available to those\nable to 'sign on' as unemployed and available\nfor work in the area in which they are paying\nrent. Therefore they are not applicable to\nfull-time students during term time but they\ndo provide the quickest way to get the\nhighest proportion of your rent money back\nover the vacations.\n2 Standard Housing Benefit\nThis replaces the old rent and rate rebate\nscheme and provides help with housing costs\nfor those not receiving supplementary\nbenefit. This benefit is applicable to students\nin term time and to those who need to claim\nback housing costs during the short\nvacations but are unable or unwilling to go\nthrough the 'signing on' procedure.\nSTANDARD HOUSING BENEFIT\nThis benefit is designed to help those on a low income (including students) with their\nrent and/or rates costs. Under the current\nregulations both students in council and\nprivate rented accommodation (including\nthose occupying under license agreements)\nand those in College Halls, Houses and Head\nTenancie s are eligible to apply.\nUnfortunately for those in IC owed\naccommodation (ie Halls and Houses but not\nHead Tenancies), since your rates are paid\nby the University Grants Committee you are\nnot eligible for a rate allowance, and since\nyour rents include gas and electricity your\nterm time rebates are likely to be small, but it\nis always worth applying.\nHOIV TO CLAIM\nApplication forms for Westminister,\nKensington and Chelsea, Hammersmith and\nFulham, Lambeth, Wandsworth, Merton,\nEaling and Hounslow are available from\nStudent Services, for other boroughs visit\nyour local Town Hall. When you submit your\nform you will need to include proof of your\ngrant from your local Education Authority,\nproof of your rent ie rent book/rent\nreceipts/letter from your landlord (Student\nServices if you are in College accommodation) and a note of your term\ndates. Remember these claims cannot be\nbackdated so the longer you delay the more\nmoney you could be losing! Once the\nhousing authority are in receipt of your\napplication form they may ask for any\nevidence relating to your claim which they\ndeem necessary and if they do not receive\nsuch evidence within six weeks of their\nrequest they will assume your claim to be\nwithdrawn, so make sure you reply promptly\nto all letters received. Also remember that\nmany authorities insist on students writing to\ntheir authority at the start of each vacation\nspecifically requesting a reassessment for\nthat period so make sure you do this if you\nwish a vacation assessment to be done (ie if\nyou are not going to be 'signing on' for the\nvacation).\nAgnes sends her love, Ginny and Arthur both miss you and, by the way, your rent rebate has\njust arrived.\nHOW TO CALCULATE YOUR\nSTANDARD HOUSING BENEFIT\nThis can only be a rough guide as the\nregulations are complicated and further\nadditions and subtractions may be made\naccording to an individuals circumstances.\nHVorfc out your needs allowance these are:-Single person \u00a343.05\nCouple \u00a363.50\nEach dependent child \u00a311.90\n2 U/ or fc out your gross weekly income\nThe undergraduate student grant breaks\ndown to \u00a359.29 pw during term time of which\n\u00a319.45 is disregarded for rent (but not rate)\nrebate purposes leaving an income of \u00a339.84\npw for rent rebates but the full \u00a359.29 for rate\nrebates. The vacation element in the grant is\n\u00a324.55 and no disregard is made on this\nfigure. Add on also any additional income\nfrom sponsorships, scholarships, interest on\nsavings etc.\n3 Work out eligible weekly rent and rates\nIf your rent includes any gas or electricity\ncharges these will be deducted from your\nrent. If amounts are not specified deductions\nwill normally be heating \u00a36.05 pw, cooking\n\u00a30.70 pw, hot water \u00a30.70 pw, lighting \u00a30.50\npw. Your rent will then be divided into rent\nand rates. Rates will either be based on the\nrate able value of the property in which you\nlive or will be assumed to be a set proportion\nof your total rent (usually 30-35%). During\nterm time students on a grant must deduct\n\u00a319.45 from their remaining weekly rent to\nget their 'eligible rent' figure. No deductions\nare made from rates or vacation rents.\n4 Calculate the rebate/allowance\nWork out if the weekly income is more or\nless than the needs allowance (N/A) a) If income = N/A rebate/allowance:\n= 60% weekly rates and 60% eligible weekly\nrent\nb) If income is less than N/A: Rates: 60% weekly rates plus 8% of difference\nbetween income and N/A Rent: 60% eligible weekly rent plus 25% of\ndifference between income and N/Ac) If income is more than N/A: Rates: 60% weekly rates minus 9% of\ndifference between income and N/A Rent: 60% eligible weekly rent minus 26%\ndifference between income and N/A The main disadvantage with Standard\nHousing Benefit is the time it can take for\nyour money to arrive (anything from one to\nnine months). It is worth keeping in touch\nwith your Housing Authority since some of\nthem have a disconcerting habit of\ntemporarily 'losing' claims if it can save them\nthe trouble of processing them. If you do\nhave particular difficulties with your c liam, call into Student Services and we should be\nable to help coax authorities into action.\nNext week: How to appeal if you think that\nyour rent rebate is wrong.\nFELIX Friday 12 October 1984\n\n"
