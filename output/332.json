Christ from\nwhatever stand-point never\nstood to challenge the slavery system that existed within the Roman Empire in any\nmeaningful way. On the\ncontrary, he took on precisely the opposite role; that of\nadvocating an ideology\nwhich could offer no guide\non earth to the emancipation\nof any oppressed people but\nactually offered the opposite,\nthai of accepting whatever\nfate or conditions on this\nearth which confronted the\nmasses. \"The almighty, all\npowerful wonderful loving\nGod looks on, he under-stands\". So the message is\nno need to struggle now\n(accept your conditions now\nno matter how bad they are)\nfor God understands and any-may it's worth a life of misery just to know that you\nare going to have eternal\nbliss after death. The development of all religions contain this same train of\nthought of how to avoid the\nmaterial world and replace it\nby the mystical (the emphasis on one's self, the egocentric nature occurring\nfrom the whole philosophy\nthat I must be here for some\npurpose mustn'tI; the whole\nworld is then analysed in\nterms of how it fits in with\none's self and not the con-tr ary). Does the Christian philosophy itself foster any harmful ideology (i.e. ideas which\nare opposed to the interests\nof the masses)? In fact it\nrepresents one of the biggest\nschools of thought opposing\nrevolutionaries; not only in\nits escapist philosophies but\nthrough its institutions which\nreflect the Christian ideology\nwithin the present system.\nIt was no accident that\nMuisolini and Franco both\nhad open backing including\na big flow of gold from the\nVatican's coffers to support\nthe rise of Fascism in\nEurope. Greek Orthodox\nChurch supported the Greek\ncoup, the Anglican Church\npreaches racial segregation\n.within South Africa and actively supports the regime.\nHitler like us in Britain had\nGod on his side during the\nlast war. Always great bastions of religion (the Church)\ncome down on the side of\nthe old reactionary social\nstructure and oppose the new\nsocial structure.\nAccepting God is super-natural, the all-mighty powerful creature he is supposed\nto be, whey then does he\ncondemn two-thirds of the\nworld to a permanent level\nof starvation and mal nut ri tion; to allow massive wars,\nthe dropping of atom bombs,\nsuffering and misery. There\ncan only be one conclusion\n\u2014this God must be a vicious,\ncruel God who coldly subjects millions of new born\nbabies generation after generation to this world of\nmisery without doing anything about it. (It is more\nprobable that this God has\nno super-natural powers and\nso is powerless to intervene\nin the changing events within\nthe world; so is it worth\npraying to an impotent\nGod?)\nWithin this country the\ntrade-union movement has\nwon virtually every right\nworking people have today\nwhich we all take for grant-ed, the church on the other\nhand has spent its last 100\nyears campaigning against\nthe trade union movement.\nToday, working people, stu-dents, whole layers of people\nare thrown into struggle to\ndefend their rights; what\nphilosophy should they take\nup? Mystical or material.\n(Prayer or struggle?).\nEven in Imperial College\nit is noticeable that God Soc\nis not represented on the\ngrants action committee\n(which is open to anyone);\nis it that they are opposed\nto students getting higher\ngrants or are they too busy\npraying to the government to\nconcede NUS's demands?\nJOCK ME ALL.\nUGMs\n-who takes\nth d blame?\nSir,\u2014This is a letter deploring the attitude taken by\ncertain individuals to try to\ndisrupt the union meeting, or\ncensorship of individuals, or\ncalling quorum (when, at the\ninstant it was called, the\nmeeting was definitely qu or ate). A large part of the\nblame must fall on Mr.\nBlack, Mr. Jowitt and Mr.\nLane.\nThe ultimate authority for\nthe conduct of IC student\naffairs rests with the student\nunion meetings. The prime\ntask for the executive must\nbe to ensure the smooth\nrunning of these meetings, to\ntry to minimise disruptions\nand maximise discussions. If\nExec disagree with motions\nthey should stand up and\nargue against them as\nopposed to using the rule\nbook to positively discourage\ndiscussion. Even Mr. Lane\nallows this procedure to\noccur without a murmur of\ncriticism. The Chairman's failure, time and time again,\nthroughout this year, has\nbeen to point out to the\nmeeting the purpose of having a rule book is to increase\nthe smooth running of the\nmeeting and not to do the\nopposite. As a consequence\nof the weak chairing, very\nbad publicity and the failure\nto encourage debate, this\nhas allowed a continual degeneration of meetings since\nMr. McCullough's era last\nyear.\nWe the undersigned hope\nthe executive will in future\nmake much more effort to\nencourage debate at Union\nmeetings.\nJ. VEALL\nR.L. LOLLEY\nD.C. OSBORNE\nS.F. MOULT\nC.W. F. LAMONT\nC.D. LABBETT\nP. CAINS\nR.S. HARVEY\nJ. A. EAST\nA. SMITH\nP. CORBYN\nN.C. LEPMAN\nT. LEARY\nROB ARMITAGE\nTREV PHILLIPS\nD.R. CHANNING\nFrom our\nobservant\nreader\nSir,\nBeing an observant member of IC Union I have\nobserved the following interesting occurrence. In the\narticle on SCAB last week\nthe following phrases were\nnoticed. (1) \"misconceptions\",(2) \"for the benefit\nof the students of Imperial\nCollege\", (3) \"Ents this\nyear has been an outstanding financial success and\nassuming they continue in\nthis vein in coming years\nthen it was felt that their excess should be used to benefit the entertainment of\nsmaller minority groups within the college\", (4) \"swallow\nup Film Soc or any other\nclub\", (5) Co-operation is\nthe name of the game, not\nMonopoly\". When I compared these and other\nphrases with those in an\narticle in the RCS Broadsheet I discovered that a large amount of the material\nin the two articles was dup-lica ted. There was, however,\none major difference. In the\nBroadsheet article, the name\nat the bottom was that of\nD. Dawson. The name at the\nbottom of the Felix article\nwas M.J. Simmons. This in\nitself is not particularly eyebrow raising until you realise\nthat Mr. Simmons is standing for the new post of Social\nSecretary instigated by this\nboard. Just who is it that will\nactually be in charge of the\ncommittee if Mr. Simmons\ngets elected? Mr. Simmons\nor Mr. Dawson?\nYours observantly,\nK.H.( Name and address\nsupplied).\nSonia\nresumes\nher\nJottings\nSir,\u2014/ wish to make certain comments on the running of IC Union Meetings.\nIt is each member's democratic right to challenge the\nquorum at any point in the\nmeeting and it is absolutely\ncorrect that motions requiring a large amount of\nsupport for them to be put\ninto effect such as the motion at the UGM on Thursday, 1st March proposing a lecture boycott on March\n14th should not be passed\nat an in quo rate Meeting. But\nit is becoming obvious that\ncertain elements in the union\nare using the quorum call\nsimply as a means of opposing a motion and ignoring\nthe proper means of doing\nso\u2014that of making a speech\nagainst the motion and letting people hear the reasons\nfor opposing. There were no\nspeeches against the motion\nmentioned (an amendment is\nnot a speech against).\nOn this point, the lack of\nknowledge of the constitution displayed by the chairman of the meeting (Paul\nJowitt) is to be deplored.\nAccording to Standing Order\n12, if there are no speeches\nagainst a motion the chairman must \"formally ask if\nthere is any opposition of\ndiscussion, and warn the\nmeeting that if there is no\nopposition or discussion he\nwill declare the motion . . .\ncarried and shall, in the\nevent of there being still no\nopposition or discussion, declare the motion . . . car-ried.\" This he did not do;\ninstead he moved to a vote.\nFinally I wish to deplore\nthe undemocratic behaviour\nof certain other members of\nthe union who, after the\nquorum had been successfully challenged, tried by\nvarious means to get the\nmotion carried anyway. The\ncorrect way to go about this\nis to call an EGM on another day and make sure that\nit is quo rate. It is pointless\nto go ahead with such action\nas a lecture boycott without\nthe mandate of a union meeting\u2014and the proposer of the\nmotion himself stated that\nhe did not want a vote if\nthe meeting was in quo rate. Surely if we are to get a greater amount of interest\nand involvement in the union\nwhich is essential if the\nunion is to defend and advance the interests of its\nmembers, we must have decisions taken democratically\nby the members.\nYours sincerely,\nSONIA HOCHFELDER.\nED'S NOTE: This letter\nshould have been published\nlast week. Its unfortunate\nomission was owing to circumstances beyond our control. State of\nthe Union\nDear Oily, \u2014 Knowing my\nrestrained nature as you do,\nyou will realise how disturbed I must be, to express\nmy views in your hallowed\ncolumns. It will be clear to\nanyone who heard about\nFriday's fiasco in the Great\nHall, that the time has come\nfor a reappraisal of the\nUnion's role in Imperial College, particularly with reference to its policy making; a look at the State of the\nUnion, in fact.\nIn my long experience of\nbeing closely involved with\nthe Union's affairs, there has\nalways been general agreement on internal policy;\neveryone wants divers if ica tion, more representation and\nbetter food.\nThe violent clashes that\nhave been occurring recently\nhave been almost entirely\nover external policy; over\nGrants, Autonomy, NUS,\nTrades Unions; the list is as\nlong as Penney's limousine.\nGranted, there are very\nsharp divisions over all these\nissues, but as a democratic-ally-organised body we\nshould be able to make decisions on the issues and\ntake action according to\nthese decisions. Is it, then,\nthat we are not a democracy?\nUniversally agreed criteria\nfor a working democracy are\nthat all citizens should be\nadequately informed and that\nthere should be universal\nsuffrage. We all have the\nvote; and as strongly as we\nmay criticise Oily, Felix, and\nI believe Broadsheet and the\n(unmentionable) Guilds and\nMines rags generally manage to mention the issues;\nand let's not forget Cefe. So\nwhere is the missing link?\nIt revolves around one\nword, participation. Without\nuniversal participation there\ncan be no democracy. What,\nthen, can encourage this in-vol ve ment? On reflection, one answer\nis discussion on more relevant issues; but what is more\nrelevant than Grants, Autonomy, and Education? The\nonly other answer is more\ncredible leadership. Without\ndoubt this is where we are\nfailing, and it is inexcusable\nthat people do not take the\nelections of sabbatical officers seriously.\nThe primary leadership of\nthe Union should be the\nExecutive; but how can one\nfollow the lead of Messrs.\nLane, Jowitt and Black, when\nthey cannot even be responsible enough to maintain\ntheir credibility and to stop\nscratching each others' eyes\nout in public? Mr. Lane, sin-ce re, but embattled, tries to\ndo the \"right\" thing, but is\ncaught in the impossible position of trying to satisfy both\nthe Union and the Communist Party. Mr. Black, the supremely efficient bureaucrat,\ntries to stay out of politics,\nhaving burnt his fingers a few times. Mr. Jowitt is an\nadmitted super-reactionary,\nposing as the champion of\nindividual liberty, but only\nmanaging to stifle it by his\ntotal irresponsibility.\nThe CCU Presidents, also\non the Exec, seem to have\nabdicated (in disgust?) their\nresponsibility to ICU. Where\nis the leadership in that?\nThe UGM is the policy-making body of the Union;\nwhat a farce! The centrists\nand conservatives complain\nthat the Union is having leftist policy foisted on it by the\nsmall group of people who\nMANIFESTOS\nfor the new post of\nSOCIAL SECRETARY\nto be elected at Thursday's UGM\nHaving read my article on\nhow SCAB is going to work\nin last week's Felix, you will\nnot be surprised to learn that\nI am standing for Social Secretary. I have been involved\nin the formation of SCAB from the beginning and\nknow, as I said last week,\nwhat has to be done and how\nto do it. If elected I will give\nany help which it is within\nmy power to give to any of\nthe societies on the Board.\nI will be ready to advise and\ngive assistance to them and\nto anyone who wishes to\nstart a new club which\nwould require financial assistance from SCAB. For ex-ample, if anyone wanted to\nre-start the now defunct\nBlues Club.\nI believe the function of SCAB will be to provide entertainment, and not merely\npopular entertainment, for\nthe students of Imperial College. This can only be achieved if money spinners like\nEnts., who have now decided to function more or less as\nthey have done this year, can have their profits directed\ntowards the benefit of sma ller clubs like Folk Club.\nThese clubs are not purely\nfor entertainment but are in tended to promote interest\nand participation. Entertainment in Imperial College\nwill not be improved until all\nthose concerned co-operate\nin fields such as publicity (it\nis hoped to make more use\nof Well soc's silk screen\nmachine).\nAll these things will be\nattended to if I am elected.\nIn the five years I have\nbeen at IC I have noted a distinct lack of com muni c ation between the organisers\nof entertainment and those\nwho are entertained. If elect-ed, I will attempt to find a solution to this state of\naffairs.\nIn these two years, I have\nplayed an active part in the\nrunning of IC Folk Club (for\nmost of this session as President) and also on RCS Entertainments Committee. I have therefore considerable\nexperience in the running of\nand the needs of smaller\nclubs and also in the organisation of larger events. Al though, as Social Secretary,\nI would not be directly\ninvolved in the running of\nspecific events (that is up to\nthe committees of the separate organisations) I have\nthe experience to appreciate\nthe needs and problems of\nthe organisations on the\nBoard.\nThe election will be by\npopular ballot at the Union\nmeeting on Thursday. Please\nbother to compose motions:\nCorbyn, Smith, Hochfelder,\nLane, Armitage. Why is it,\nthen, that the centre and the\nright cannot present its own\nmotions, rather than waiting\nto destroy the leftist policy,\nor amending it until it effectively says nothing? Messrs.\nSinclair and Jowitt are brilliant at composing amend-ment s; have they no policy to\npresent?\nIf people can turn out to\nblock the Rent Strike, why\ncan't they turn out to vote\nfor what they think is reas-on able? Or is it the feeling\ngenerally that we should do\nnothing on Grants, Autonomy\nand White Paper?\nI'd like to see the Union\nbeing positive; we can't all\nbe socialist, but we can be\nactivist, and participate in\nthe running of the Union.\nCentrists and the Right\nshould not react to leftist\npolicy by destroying it, but\nby presenting alternative\npolicy; there must be a dialogue in the Union rather\nthan messy, juvenile squab-bling.\nThe solution to our problem is participation, not red-bashing; if we're dissatisfied\nwith our official leadership\nlet's censure it, or even replace it; but for Christ's sake\nlet's all sit down and talk\nrationally and positively.\nYours etc.,\nM.T. PHILLIPS\ncome and vote. It is vital that\nSCAB gets the right kind of\nleadership if it is to function\nas it is intended to function\nand I believe that I can provide that, kind of leadership.\nAlso, I believe, as I feel sure\nyou will, that we must prevent a great Ents takeover.\nPlease come along and\nvote, and better still, vote\nfor me, Mike Simmons, for\na more unified and comprehensive system of entertainment and recreation at IC.\nMIKE SIMMONS. I would like to introduce\nyou to Jim Mitchell. Jim has\nemerged from Aero 2 to\nstand for the newly created\npost of social secretary. For\nthe past year he has been\nactively involved in the running of both I.C. ents and C and G ents. This means he\nhas helped organise both\nlarge scale events, e.g. C and G carnival, I.C. ents concerts,\nand smaller events, e.g. C and G revue. The first of\nthese meant close liaison\nwith dram soc and film soc who are both members of\nSCAB. He is very well\nknown around college and\nhas always involved himself\nin discussions on any aspects of entertainments.\nTherefore, please support\nJim in the elections on\nThursday.\nP.A. WADSWORTH\nHello! Well you've heard\nwho Iam and where I come from, I'd now like to say\nwhy I think I'd make a good Social Secretary next year.\nThis job of social sec is a job common in other colleges\nand is ideally just a question\nof co-ordinating the events\nput on by Film soc, Folk\nClub, Ents, etc., and doing\nthis without treading on anybody's toes. SCAB must\nbe run to give entertainment\nfor all minority and majority\ngroups within college and\nonly secondary allowance\nmust be made for outsiders.\nThis could mean supervising\nthe birth or resurrection of\nother entertainment clubs\nsuch as Blues soc. Firstly,\nthough, we must find out\nwhat YOU want and to this\nend an Arts festival could be\nrun next term.\nSCAB will make it easier\nfor bookings and publicity,\nIC Ents has the connections\nto make booking of bands\nand artistes of all kinds easier, hence easing the load on other parts of SCAB. Rag Week events. Folk\ncarnival etc. could be made more viable by S CAB,in stead of the current situation in which CC U's run\nthese events in a semi amateur manner.\nFinancially, matters can be made more secure by\npooling resources, hence\nany clubs catering for total\nminority interests will not be\nconsidered \" poor cousins\" of Ents, Filmsoc, etc.\nAs SCAB will be the sole\nrepresentative on council\nfor events, this will give a fair hearing to all instead of\njust Ents as is now the case.\nIt must be understood that\nSCAB is not an Ents takeover\nof the rest. Rather it is a pooling and co-ordination of\nresources and experience\nthat events will be more vi able and desirable, especially where large scale events\nare concerned.\nSo oom e along to the\nUnion meeting next Thursday and vote for the students\ncandidate and make your college more enjoyable next\nyear.\nJ.

It will be crammed with advertising\nfrom all sorts and conditions of institutions vying with each other to grab your money and use it, as\nthey say, to your advantage.\nSchemes, plans, policies, blueprints, programmes,\nprojects, st rate gems and systems pour out of the\npages in an avalanche of print. Every one stuffed\nwith reasons why you ought to part with your cash and allow some body of faceless men work a kind\nof magic and make it multiply for you.\nThey come under a variety of headings. Unit\nTrusts, Property Bonds, Guaranteed Growth Bonds, Single Premium Annuities or mere advice on in vestment. Anything this side of the law which might\nearn a buck for the operator.\nWell, of course, we all know that very few readers of Felix Financially have enough spare loot to\nbe over-worried about the machinations of these\nthings right now, but we thought it would be interesting to explain what some of them are and what\nthey do. After all, we'll all be in the chips one day,\nand forewarned is forearmed.\nProbably the best known of these ideas are those\nknown as Unit Trusts. A unit trust is simply a pool\nof money contributed in small or large amounts\nby numbers of individuals and which is then invested by the trust managers in stocks and shares.\nThe value of any one person's investment is the\nvalue of the shares the trust has bought for them.\nAs the market goes up and down, so does the value\nof the investment you make.\nThe operators of such schemes as these make\ntheir profit by making an initial charge \u2014 usually between 3 and5 per cent of every pound invested\n\u2014 and a management fee, usually levied half-yearly,\non the income from the investments. This normally\ncomes to between one-fifth and one-half per cent.\nSome unit trusts specialise in different types of\ninvestment. For example, some go for North A meri can shares, some for mining shares, others go for\nretail shop shares, and so on. And the aims of different unit trusts are different.\nSome aim to produce income for the investor; others\ngo for straight capital gain. But the majority spread\ntheir investment fairly widely and this is the case\nwith most of the 2 8 0 or so unit trusts now operating\nin this country.\nOne incentive here, of course, is that the operator has the same interest in the profitable working of the trust as the investor, since the bigger the\ntrust fund is, the bigger the profit for its managers.\nIn return, the investor is supposed to get skilled,\nprofessional management, which ought to make\nhis money grow.\nBut if the aims and methods of unit trusts vary,\nso does the performance. On past results, it appears\nthey will take about 16 years to double your invest-ment, and that's not a lot of good in these inflationary times.\nNaturally, a lot depends on when you buy into\nthe trust and when you sell out. You pay for expert\nadvice, but even with the best of the unit trusts,\neverything hinges on how well you time your buying\nand selling of your investment with them.\nAnother type of unit trust is the property bond. These are often organised by insurance companies,\nwhich put your money into property rather than in\nshares. Now, this column has always advised in\nfavour of putting money into property, and many\nof these property trusts do represent a reasonable\nhedge against inflation.\nThe trouble is they have proved so popular in\nthe past year that many property bond operators\nhave bought every type of property in a kind of\nblind panic. The properties are valued each month\nby independent value rs and they always report in creased values. The snag is that when the fund\ngoes to sell, it might well find that properties do\nnot fetch quite the same as their value on paper.\nNevertheless, it has to be said that this is one\nway of getting into property\u2014and a continually rising market\u2014without committing yourself to one\nbuilding.\nInvestment Trusts are not to be confused with Unit\nTrusts. Investment Trusts are merely private trading companies who specialise in the buying and selling of other companies' shares. They tend to be\nmore internationally-minded than other investment\nprogrammes, and have a fairly successful record.\nAs with unit trusts, there are tax advantages for the\ninvestor. The real trick here is to pick the right one,\nsince there are over 2 0 0 of these to choose from.\nEquity Bonds are similar to property bonds,\nexcept the investment is done in equities. Here\nagain, the results will depend on when you get in\nand when you get out \u2014 and whether the management are the fat cats of the financial world or the\nbright young men. Guaranteed Growth Bonds are issued by insurance companies, as a rule, and they are merely\nsingle premium investments with a guaranteed return over a period of years. How good they are\ndepends on the overall financial situation at the time\nof investment. They are sometimes very attractive,\nbut the gamble always is whether the rate you are\noffered today is going to be realistic in five years'\ntime, when your money is still tied up. So, they are just some of the ideas money men have had to make a profit. There are many ways to\ndo it, of course, and when it comes to making a shilling, the gnomes are wise to them all. But always remember it's your money they're\nafter. Before ever you fall for the blandishments in\nthe ads, or get conned into thinking you have only\nto sit back and wa?t for your money to grow, have\na good look at the investment scheme that attracts\nyou and make sure it's right.\nCheck its performance, its reputation and its via-bil it y. Take independent, expert advice if you can. And don't take anything entirely on trust\u2014even\nif it is a unit trust.\nFELIX No. 3 3 2 ; Tuesday. 13th March,1973. Editor: Oliver Dow son.

In Volume1 Number 8 ( March13 th,1969) we reported on the election of John Butterworth\n(President), Barry Pywell (VP) and Miss Penny Walters as Hon. Sec. The following year a poll of 331\nwas reached, this being constitutionally too small the\nelection was re held the following term. (See we beat\nI.C.U. by all of 3 years!). The\" winner\" of this presidential election, Mr. P. Sharkey, came only third in the\nsecond election, which was won by Steve Cooke, with\nNick Wilkinson beating Tony Johnson as VP. Ho wever this second poll (of 385) was again too small (by\nabout 115 votes) but not to worry folks, an in quo rate results U. G.M. accepted the election (things never\nchange, do they?). The following year (in one of the\nfirst Roneo'd Broadsheets) the poll was better (442)\nand Bill Gerrard beat Pete Gannen (231 to 156) to\nbecome President '71-2 and M.C. Black (I 've heard of\nhim) became Hon. Sec. by beating N. Wilkinson. The following year's election results edition of Broadsheet\n(Vol. 4 No.7 j \u2014brilliantly done by a newly appointed\neditor) told the story of last year's507 vote poll, with\nRosemary Parker winning the presidential election\n(against John Higgs), Caroline Bingham beating Bill Collett (and how! 368 to 90), John Smith got elected\nas A AO in preference to John Gibbons and there were\n3 candidates for the post of Hon.

    "content": "Tuesday, March 13th,1973 FELIX Entertainments\nOnce again, for most of this year,\none of the popular pastimes of both\nunion members and college administration has been the \" knocking\" of I.C. Ents Committee. The time has arrived,\nspurred on by the introduction of\nSCAB, for the committee to answer\nsome of these comments. In this article we hope to present a much greater\nstatement of our policy, aims, method\nof running, reasons, etc. than we believe have been actually printed at any\none time before.\nDuring the course of this year, Ents\nhas run what it regards as one of the\nmost successful s cries of concerts ever\nrun at IC. In this series an attempt\nhas been made to cater for all tastes.\nWe have had folk artists (Fairport Convention), heavy rock (Beck, Bogert, Ap pice), good \"old - fashioned\" dance\nbands (Brett Marvin), ultra-progressive\n( Amon Duul) and all other shades and\ntypes of music between. It has been\nargued that we ought to have more\nfolk and jazz artists because l.C. students prefer this type of music. This\nis all very well but such artists don't exist ad infinitum.\nRalph Mc Tell was booked for this\nterm but pulled out. We are trying to\narrange a return date for next term.\nWe had a chance of Tom Paxton\n(which we were going to accept) but he\nhas decided that he doesn't want to do\nany London dates at the moment. Despite people's insistence that folk and\njazz are what the committee should promote this does not appear to be the\ncase. R.C.S. ran a folk carnival a short\ntime ago with some of the best known\nartists on the folk scene at the present\ntime. This was advertised all over Lon don and yet it still only managed to\ndraw about 250 people, of which probably only half were from I.C., and made\na loss of about \u00a3200. If Ents. ran on\nthis basis over a period of 20 weeks\nwe would lose \u00a34,000 which I'm sure\nwould not be popular with anyone. Neither folk or jazz club, to our knowledge,\nare exactly overwhelmed with the number of people clam our ing to join them.\nWe would hope that with the formation\nof SCAB that next year folk club (who\nthis year have worked on a total allowance of \u00a397) and jazz club would be in\na position to present more ambitious\nprogrammes than they would otherwise be able to afford. To do this it\nwould be neccessary for the Ents committee to be in a position to be able to\nfinance them. It is hoped that Ents\nwould continue to put on the big names\nwho are obviously beyond the capability of folk or jazz club, with the clubs\npresenting better names than at present\nand on a more regular basis.\nA large number of complaints concern the fact that non-students attend\nEnts concerts in large numbers. We\nhave said all along that this is necessary from a financial point of view and\nthis will be even more the case if Ents\nare to be expected to be the main finance providers for SCAB. However,\nnow that we have such popular groups\non it is neccessary to alter our policy\nso that I.C. students get by far the better chance of obtaining tickets to Ents\nfunctions. It is only since we have had\nthis long series of sell-out concerts that\nthe problem of outsiders receiving tickets for I.C. students has arisen. For future concerts the following proceed ure will be adopted. Publicity for coming\ndates will be given firstly to I.C. students only (e.g. Felix, notice boards,\netc.). We would hope that when I.C. students get in touch with the committee about tickets for a concert, wc\nwi! 1 know definitely when tickets will be\non sale but the date cannot be guaranteed because we are at the mercy of\nthe printers. When tickets are on sale\nthe following pricing will apply. All concerts will have three stated ticket\nprices. The lowest of these will be the\nprice to I.C. students of the first two\ntickets they buy. The reduction will be\ngiven on the production of a college\nregistration card. There will be someone selling tickets in the Room At The\nTop every week-day dinner time (this\ncut-price will not be available at the\nbookshop). The reduction will take effect on tickets for concerts held next\nterm and future concerts. Please notice\nthat it is also limited to two per registration card. The second price will be\nthat for all subsequent tickets and also\nthe advance price for non I.C, students.\nThe third price will be the price of all\ntickets sold on the door. The difference\nin price of the first two prices will always be at least 1 Op and likewise for\nthe second and third price. It may, how-ever, be more. Typical price structures\ncould be \u00a31.00, \u00a31.30, \u00a31.50 for an\nexpensive concert or 60p,70p,80p, for a cheaper concert. I.C. students\ncould therefore save up to 50p on the\ndoor price.\nThere are further points arising from\nthe' admittance of non-IC students or\neven non-students. At present N.U.S. is running a grants campaign. One of\nthe ways in which they are trying to\nwin public support is by involving the\ngeneral public in their cause. Surely\nthe student age group of the general\npublic is as important as the older\n\u2022members of the country. They can\nafter all vote nowadays. Therefore, why\nnot extend some of our facilities to\nnon-students. So long as students are\nallowed to have special facilities purely\nfor their own use it is going to make\nthe case for higher grants that much\nharder. Conversely, if non-students are\nallowed to participate in functions such\nas Ents concerts then they will be more\ninclined to support our campaign.\nAt any given concert there will be\na certain number of IC students. We estimate that the average number is in\nthe region of 400 but that it will vary\nfrom 200 up to I.C. students only. This\nmay not seem to be a very large percentage of the audience but surely we\nshould provide them with the entertainment they want and then ensure that it\nis financially viable by allowing non IC\nstudents to attend rather than not run\nanything at all. IC students do attend our functions. Should we stop\nthem just because there are not enough\nof them?\nDuring the last year an extension\nhas been built in the lower lounge of\nthe union. This is to enable the union\nto cater for larger crowds of people.\nThis situation only arises on a regular\nbasis when the Ents committee has a function. All this term the Ents committee members have been giving directions to the Queens public house rather\nthan the union bar. It appears, how-ever, that the ordinary I.C. student (who\nare the people on behalf of whom at\nleast one member of this college believes\nhe is actively fighting) have been giving\ndirections to the union bar. Furthermore, it is not only on the nights that\nEnts has a function that outsiders frequent the bars. It has been reported\nthat the landlord of the Ennismore public house knows that alcohol at I.C. is\ncheap and that he has been losing custom to our bars. It will be interesting\nto see how much the bar profit will\nstart to fall now that card checks are\nbeing enforced. The takings in the\nJ. C.R. bar in college block used to be\nregularly in the \u00a3400 region on the\nnight of an Ents function. The loss in\ntakings then, since the bar has been\nclosed, will be in the region of \u00a34,000.\nIt was also reported that the brewery\nwere threatening to stop supplying the\ncollege block bars because it was not\neconomically viable for them to continue doing so.\nWith the introduction of V.A.T. our\nprices will have to go up. Very simply,\nVAT will affect Ents in that one-eleventh of all money it receives (from\nticket sales or any other source) will\nhave to be paid in tax. On this year's showing this would approximately\nequal this year's profit as it stands at\npresent. The average IC student will not\nbe able to fully afford the increase that\nwill be necessary in ticket prices, and we\nwill have to pass as much of this as\npossible on to non IC students. Financially this year the committee has done\nvery well. The profit stands, at present,\nat \u00a31,650 and the forecast for dates remaining and next terms as well is that\nthis figure will increase by the end of\nthe academic year. At last council it\nwas officially agreed to record the Ents\naccount as having to make \u00a31.000\nrather than breaking even. This \u00a31,000\na 'ong with a similar sum from reserves\nwill be used to buy a complete new set\nof chairs for the union concert hall and\na new carpet for the southside lounges,\npractical proof that the profit from\nEnts has enabled the union to purchase\narticles that they may have otherwise\nbeen unable to afford. Compared with\nother colleges, the financial situation of\nIC Ents is excellent. Places like Leeds\nPo'v are at present running at a deficit\nof \u00a34.500 this year alone (information\nfrom Leed's official college newspaper).\nNumerous colleges in London are losing up to \u00a31,500 with the average being about \u00a3700 (these two figures come\nfrom a survey of London's colleges' entertainments committees done prior to\na meeting of London social secretaries\norganised by IC Ents chairman Paul\nWadsworth). We are the only London\ncollege to our knowledge to be making\nsuch a large or of it and this is in face of\ncompetition from places like the Rain bow, the Sundown, the Festival Hall and all the other large pro motors. With\nthe introduction of SCAB it will be\nnecessary for TC Ents to make a profit\nto ensure the financial feasibility of the\nboard. To ensure this we need to continue to promote the largest named\nbands that our hall will allow us to.\nThe subject of large names brings us\non to the Elton John concert which,\nby the time you read this, will have\nalready been held. We would like to\nclear up some of the misunderstandings\nthat seem to have arisen from the ticket\nselling for this concert. The Elton John\ndate was not advertised outside college\nat all until after it had sold out. The\ntickets went on sale on a Thursday and\nhad completely so'd out by the fo'low-ing Tuesday lunchtime. The first mention in the music press of the date was\non the afternoon that the concert sold\nout. It has been said that an inadequate\nunion card check was done while the\ntickets were being sold. If outside people\ndid not know about it how could they\nhave bought tickets? While we don't admit that not one single Non IC student bought a ticket the number of\ntickets sold to non IC students were\nminimal. Also, surely the people that\nregularly support our concerts are entitled to attend all of our concerts if\nthey so wish.\nStaying with the subject of large\nname bands some people seem to think\nthat it is possible to obtain large name\nbands on an irregular basis. It is only\nbecause we run on a regular basis that\nwe are able to get big named bands.\nTo get these people to work for you,\nyou don't only need a hall and an\nability to pay their price, you also need\nto be able to assure them that yours\nis a date that is going to improve their\nru put ation or which will live up to the\nstandard that their fans expect to be\nable to see them in. IC Ents is in the\nposition where it is able to get a good\nrange of top name bands. People who\nhave played here in the past have normally been very pleased at the reception they have been given both by the\naudience and by our own committee,\noften complimenting us on a well run\nconcert. This year's committee has built\nup IC to be one of the prestige dates\nto do on a London tour. This can only\nbe done by the regular booking of\nlarge names.\nSCAB has been mentioned at various points in this article. The setting\nup of this board is welcomed by the\nEnts committee. At last a working committee has been set up that will be able\nto co-or d in dte all entertainments within the college. Our committee has no\nintention of taking over film soc or any\nother of the committees and societies\nthat form SCAB. The confusion over\nfilm society arose at the preliminary\nmeeting held to discuss the formation of\nSCAB, where it was said by the film\nsoc representative that they did not\nwant to show popular films next year.\nOur committee realised that this would\nleave a gap in the type of entertainment\nprovided to IC students and so offered\nto fill this gap by showing popular\nfi'ms. Later that week the rumour\nstarted that Ents were trying to take\nover from film soc but this is not the\ncase. Film soc are having the first\nchoice of films that they want to show\nnext year, but there will, however, at\ntheir own choosing, only be a few of the\ntype of film that they have been showing this year. The Ents committee will\nbe providing those films that the film\nsoc don't want to include in their pro-gram me. We will start with a trial run\nnext term for four weeks (see list at\nend of article). One of these dates is\nactually a film soc date which has already come about as a result of cooperation between us and film soc.\nFormation of SCAB will enable profits\nfrom Ents to be used to support the\nother, smaller clubs represented on the\nboard.\nThis has been an attempt to iron out\nany of the difficulties and complaints\nthat have been levelled at our com-mitte e. We would appeal for active\npractical criticisms, advice, ideas or\nany other comments that people w ou'd like to make about the committee and\nthe way it is running at present. With\nthe reduction in the price of tickets\nfor IC students wc would hope to see\nan even greater number of you at our\nconcerts. If you w ou'd like to ask\nabout any problems regarding Ents\nthere is always an Ents executive member in the Room At The Top at dinner\ntimes and they will be only too grateful to sit you down, listen to you and\nthen get involved in a discussion with\nyou. Finally, here is a list of the films\nthat we will be showing next term.\nThey will all be in ME220 and the\nprice of entry for the Ents run ones\nwill be lOp.\nFriday May4 th Dirty Harry\nFriday May11 th Carnal Knowledge\nFriday May18 th Brewster Mc Cloud( film soc)\"\nFriday May25 th Every Home Should\nHave One\nP.A.

On Monday last week Adams told students on rent strike that\nunless they paid their hall fees by the end of the week they\nwould be evicted. There have been rumours that overseas\nstudents would be sent down if they failed to pay up.\nNICE ONE WALTER( censored) Once again Walter Adams has broken rank with the\nother vice chancellors when\nhe (and the Dundee VC) entered into direct conflict\nwith students supporting the\nNUS grants campaign. The\nexpected conflict with the\npolice did not occur during last week's sit in. Walter, it\nseemed, was quite happy for\nthe students to occupy St.\nClement's as long as they did\nnot interfere with the running of the School. He did\nget annoyed at the pickets\nhowever. He told the three\n'leaders' of the sit in that he\nwould have them arrested unless they called them off.\nThis brilliant tactical move\nby Mr. Adams was ably\nthwarted by the leaders. They\npolitely asked the pickets to\nmove on. who politely re-fused! The three had absolved themselves of legal\nresponsibility!\nSCUFFLES As well as occupying the\nSt. Clements building they also picketed classes and the\nlibrary on Thursday and Fri day. About150 students slept\nin on Thursday night including Jeff Si ann it or th, NUS Treasurer. There were a few\nscuffles on Thursday evening on the picket line but\ngenerally it has been qui ec \u2014\nit was so quiet and so lacking in violent student clashes\nthat the media revel in that\nthe Mirror was forced to describe it as the \"most boring\nstrike in Britain today\". On\nFriday morning about 50\npickets stood at the various\nentrances. Everyone that\nwent in was asked to sign a declaration of solidarity with the pickets' action, but the\nresponse was poor w. th Adams looking on.\nALLIANCE The decision to boycott\nwas taken on Tuesday and in\nspite of opposition from some\nUnion Exec, members, militancy was the order of the\nday, however suggestions for\nripping up paving slabs and\nstoning Parliament, and similar violent action were rejected as infantile disorder. The\nthree main points of the\ncampaign were agreed as\nfirstly \"to protect the rent\nstrikers. against victim is ation\"; secondly \"to support\nthe national campaign for\nhig tier grants\" and thirdly\n\"to support the worker-stu-dent alliance against a common enemy\". In this latter\naim they hoped to get support from Briant's colour\nprinters whom they had\nsupported when they were\npicketing. The college porters\nwere helpful at night but in the morning a few went\nround and cut chains barring\ndoors.\nSUPPORT At the union meeting on\nFriday afternoon it was decided to discontinue the occupation. Carl Saunders hall\nand two blocks of student\nflats decided to stay out on\nstrike and full support from\nthe Union was voted to them,\nincluding the promise to pay\nall legal fees, and possible\nlines. So the situation is that\nwith only one week of term-time left at LSE, it is possible that those on rent\nstrike will find themselves\nlocked out of their halls\nwhen they arrive back in London next term. There are\nseveral ways that the situation could be avoided. A sit\nin next week to effectively\nput the college out of ac-tion; or a sit in through the\nholidays in the halls affected;\nor by Blacking (no relation)\nthe halls; i.e. no student\nw ou'd reoccupy the vacated\nrooms next term. Next week\ncould see the head-on clash\nat LSE( again)!\nALWAYS READ THE SMALL PRINT\nPRESIDENT'S PIECE\nALL OUT QN MARCH 14th Friday's extraordinary general meeting was a good start in the right for 100 per cent support\ntor the National Student Strike tomorrow. The\nmeeting was one or the best advertised this term,\nit was well quo rate and passed the strike motion\nby a solid majority. It was really hilarious to see\nthe expressions on the races of the poor saps who\ncame along for the sole purpose of challenging\nt ne quorum, when the E.G. M. turned out to be\nvery well attended indeed. We have rather too\nmany wet sponges and prophets of doom in I.C. telling us how apathetic we all are. It's real good\nto see them put in their place once in a while.\nNobody i can now complain that the decision to\nsupport the N.U.S. strike was undemocratic. It\nhas been debated at two union meetings, the issue\nhas been discussed throughout the college over the\nlast fortnight, and everyone had the chance to\ncome along on Friday to speak and vote. Once\na decision is taken in a quo rate union meeting it\nshould be implemented by every member, however the good thing about Friday's meeting was\nthat we voted in favour in the knowledge that\neveryone there would have to work to make the\nstrike a success. Ordinary students will have to\nbe convinced by personal discussions to support\nthe strike and that's where YOU come in. You can\ndo three things:\u2014\n(1) Discuss with the others in your class why\nthey should strike on Wednesday and join in the\nActivity;\n(2) Organise a petition round your class asking\nlecturers to support you by postponing the lecture\n(petitions available from the union office).\n(3) Turn up early tomorrow morning to man the\nentrance to your department to persuade other\nstudents to attend the alternative activities (teach-in on education etc.) instead of their usual lec-ture s. If even a small faction of the readership of\nFelix do the three things mentioned above the\nstrike will be a success.\nWHY STRIKE?\nAs the campaign has developed the reasons\npeople have given for not supporting militant action\nhave been disproved in no uncertain fashion. The\nidea that militancy alienates the public has been\nshattered. This campaign has had- a lot of good\npublicity (and virtually no bad publicity) cent ring around the rent strikes and demonstrations. Also\nthe idea that what is needed is reasoned discussion between N.U.S. and the D.E.S. has been\nproved absurd. It was a hard fight to get that discussion and when it came the Government con Id\nnot argue against our case but argued solely that\nthe state of the economy could not support a grants increase. Unfortunately for them, this argument looks a bit thin when we remember that the\nsurtax reforms in the budget gave for instance\nEdward Heath a \u00a36.20 per week bonus and that\neducation and housing expenditure is being cut\nback to allow for expansion in defence expend i ture.\nThe Government is doing little to hold down\nprices and many of its measures are pushing them\nup\u2014floating the pound, V.A.T. AH we are asking is\nfor the right to maintain the standards that students had in the immediate past and to ensure\nthat no student is discriminated against because\nof their parents' meanness or the type of course\nthey are doing.\nIn fighting for higher grants we are not being\nselfish\u2014some of us will not even benefit directly.\nWe are representing the interests of future students\nand trying to safeguard the right of people to enter\nhigher education regardless of their parents'\nwealth. For if the value of the maintenance grant\ncontinues to decline education will become a privilege for those whose parents are able (and\nwilling) to sub sid is e their children.\nTo those who are not swayed by any of the\nabove arguments can I say this? What is your\nalternative? The March 14th strike can be a very\nimpressive demonstration of support for the claim.\nIt will also give the Government some considerable\nfood for thought. If N.U.S. can bring higher education to a standstill for one day, wii l there ever be\npeace in the Colleges until the claim is met?\nAre we just going to allow the Government to\n\"think about our claim'-' till doomsday? If so, we\nmight as well send a nice letter to St. John-Stevas\nsaying \"O.K., Norman, we weren't really serious\nabout the grants increase\u2014sorry about all the\ndemos and shouting, etc., etc.\" Well we could just\nlie down, curl up and die, but I think the E.G. M. showed what the majority think \u2014 continue the\nfight \u2014 stop the delays on the grants claim \u2014 all\nout on March 1 4th. Note. Overseas students may be worried that\njoining the strike could lead to deportation or\nwithdrawn scholarships. It is the N.U.S.'s belief\nthat an overseas student sponsored by the British\nGovernment will not suffer as a result of the day's activity. It is just possible but extremely unlikely\nthat a \"politically sensitive\" overseas student sponsored by his home government may have problems. I would urge all overseas students to support the Day of Action, even if it does not affect\ntheir own grants, to help their fellow students.\nIf, however, they are frightened of reprisals, the\nunion will of course, make every allowance for\nthis.\nBut the best solution is to make sure that there\naren't any classes to go to anyway!\nPAPERBACKS\n' Jung' by Anthony Storr,\nModern Masters.40 p. Fontana\nIt is a frequent criticism of explanatory books on great men and their work that the original was more\ncomprehensible than the Bowdler\nis ed version and, that people's a we of\na legendary name exaggerates the\nimagined difficulty of reading him. With this in mind one tends to approach any item in the 'Fontana Mo dern Masters' series with a certain\nsuspicion. However, Anthony Storr's book on Jung is a welcome exception.\nJung, psychologist cum philosopher,\nis a name to conjure with. In spite of\nhis widespread reputation very few\ndo so owing to unequally widespread\nignorance of the content of his\nwriting. If Freud has suffered by misrepresentation then Jung has been\nexcluded from the common under\nstanding by having no representation\nat all. Few names can be so widely known and so little understood.\nTo add to this promising start\nJung' s work is excessively obscure.\nHis remarkable inability to com muni cate and the weight of his writings\ndemand the sort of exposition that\nthe Fontana series are designed to\nprovide.\nMr. Storr does well in compressing\ninto 1 2 0 pages an appreciation of\nJung's ideas. He concentrates on the\nbanes of Jung' s thought rather than\nemphasising the historical, narrative\naspect, which renders the book both\nmore readable and more useful. He succeeds in setting out the major\ndevelopments first attributable to\nJung, as well as Jung's understanding of them, and relating these to current trains of thought. The result is\nthat one feels it would be difficult\nand unwise to argue over this borderline area of man's personality related\nto his health and beliefs, in disregard\nto the foundations of modern under-standing.\nR.

ISSUE No. 332\nPost-Grads\nunite for action\nTomorrow, Wednesday, 14th of March, is the Day\nof Action in support of the Grants Campaign. Included in the Programme of Events will be a discussion\non Post Graduates Affairs in Mech. Eng. 220 from 11\na.m. onwards* The discussion will be on a broader level\nthan just grants, though this will constitute an hn por tant part. Other topics of interest to P.G.' s are demonstrating fees, insurance whilst working, the standard\nPRESIDENTIAL\nELECTIONS A FLOP\nof catering facilities and\nbureaucracy.\nThe basis for the discus-cus sion will be the replies\nto the recent questionnaire sent to all post graduates of whom over 240\nreplied. It showed their\nP.G.' s are interested, are\nconcerned and are willing\nto do something. Having\nthe information is very im-port ant. In a recent NUS publication, \"Post graduate Studentship: An interim Review\" is stated. \" We seriously doubt the validity of D.E.S.' s estimate that\npostgraduate (demon strat ing) earnings averaged as\nmuch as \u00a3160 in 1969 . .\"\nother problems of College\nLast week's Presidential elections were a complete wash-out. Only 540 students voted, a shortfall of nearly 500 on the number required\nto make the vote \"quo rate\". It was the third\nsuch election held this year, and few expected\nit to be any more successful than its predecessors. The candidates, Simon Allnutt and John Herrick\nfor President and Rob Armitage and Francis Matthews\nfor Secretary,, were standing for posts for the next\nacademic year, 1973-4.\nBoth posts carry a sabbatical year. Nominations\nopened yesterday for the\nre-election. Forms will remain up until the last day\nof term on Friday week,\nand the elections will be\nheld a week after the start\nof next term, on May8 th and 9th.An election was held in\nOctober for President for\nthe current year, following\nthe failure of Chris Sheppard, President-elect, to\ntake his examinations last\nsummer. The candidates\nwere Rob Armitage and\nAdrian Smith. Although a quorum of votes were cast,\nthe candidates only got\nabout a hundred each \u2014\nthere were a record 833\nabstentions, mainly caused\nby a propaganda leaflet\nput out by the constituent\ncollege executives.\nThe re-election, held in November, brought with it\nfive candidates \u2014 John\nLane was eventually elect-ed, but only by a vote that\nfell short of the quorum by\nabout 40.\nIn view of the number\nof elections held this year,\nand the lack of publicity\nfor the last ones, it seems\nhardly surprising that there\nis such a lack of interest\nin them.\nNUPE threatens to close college\nM' 'PL is the union of non-technical and non-admin-is tr at ive workers at IC, its membership is 90% of the\nnight security guards, messengers, catering and refectory staff, cleaners and certain sections of the maintenance personnel. They have given the college notice that\nthey are considering holding on the spot 24 hour strikes\nin the near future.\nCUTBACKS This is the first time ever that I CN UP E has threatened industrial action. The situation which has precipitated the need for such action is the continuing cutbacks in the numbers of night security guards and messengers which has resulted in them being i jn able to fulfil their jobs. As an example they cite that the messengers have been cut from 59 to35 over the last3 years and the reduction of cleaning staff from100 to 20.\nEXPLOSIVE KEG Fire regulations state, they say, that the main entrance of every building is to be manned24 hours a day. If\na security guard or a messenger is ill or on holiday then, owing to the reduction in staff, the entrances are often only manned by one person. During the night the security guards have to make periodic checks of their building,\" clocking in\" at certain fixed points en route, and it can take up to3 hours for them to make one round. The messengers also have to leave their posts during the day; to deliver mail, fill a kettle or even just goto the loo. At Action in Confusion\nLast Thursday's U GM passed a motion calling for a lecture boycott tomorrow in support of theN US Day of Action. TheN US is calling for a national strike of students following its abortive attempts last week to persuade the DES to increase student grants for the next session. The Grants Action Committee was mandated to organise an\" alternative education programme'' to replace lectures, and this will take place in the Great Hall. A number of speakers have been invited to address the meeting from trades unions, political parties, etc. In the afternoon, there will be a public education campaign, in Oxford Street, not quite along the lines suggested in a recent FELIX editorial, but more resembling a leafleting campaign. The Ents committee is attempting to organise some kind of entertainment in the evening. This will beat least\na disco, and there will be\nsome bands if it is possible to get College Block( at present the Dancing Club has a booking on it, and it will probably be almost impossible to remove them). The organisation of the Day of Action on a London scale was discussed at a meeting last Thursday evening at the University of London Union. Amateur chairing of the meeting was responsible for its wasting ninety minutes discussing the merits and dem er its of a regional demon rst ration on the day,when it had been more than obvious from the start that the mee ting was against it( the vote was2 in favour,2 abstaining, everyone else against). The Day of Action is obviously going to be totally disorganised if this meeting was anything to go by. IC was only\nrepresented by the USK Coordinator and the Felix reporter; none of the officials\nof the Union attended. Readers will be interested to hear that IC has the only comprehensive programme of events for the Day in London; other colleges are merely boycotting lectures or sitting in.\nthese times there is noone at the desk and hence noone to supervise the fire alarms or check entries of unwanted people \u2014 this makes a farce of fire precautions and banishes any notions of security. As one N UP E messenger put it\n\" students in hall are living on an explosive keg.\" ROBBERY N UP E say that the lack of adequate security and fire precautions is deplored by the academic staff, the wardens and the halls committee have also written to the college about this issue. In some Of the messengers' areas there is a safe which contains money, neither they nor the night security men have been issued with keys. In the event of a robbery nobody would believe that the night security men did not have the key, which could lead to physical intimidation and possibly violence. There is no alarm attached to the safe nor any that could be operated by the manon duty should such a situation occur. When N UP E worried by the implications, explained this to Carl Seaford, he pooh poohed the idea, saying that a robbery would not possibly take place a tIC. Two days later robbers made off with \u00a310,000 from the IC branch of theN at West bank in College Block. PUSHED TO LIMIT A night security man said that Fire Precaution Officers\nwould disallow many Union building functions as there are not enough fire escape routes and often too many' obstructions to allow easy evacuation. He seemed to regard the general situation as one which has been pushed to the limit \u2014 just a single emergency which could have been contained by previous controls would now flare up into disaster with needless danger to persons and property. SAFETY This is why N UP E will be striking, their reasons are not primarily wages, though they feel that their wages require drastic restructuring, but one of safety to themselves, to the staff and to the students. This in a very vague\nstatement. From the basis\nof the reply, we can now\nsay that at I.C.. the average postgraduate who\nwas lucky enough to get\nany demons tAi ting at all. and it seems that only 44\nper cent have managed to\ndo it since their arrival\nhere, had average earnings\nconsiderably less than\n\u00a3100, and only very few\nhave earned more than\n\u00a3160, the D.E.S.' s average figure.\n52 per cent of respondents receive the basic research council grant of\n\u00a3650, and a further 10 per\ncent receive less. Therefore, bearing in mind that\nonly 44 per cent can supplement their income by\ndemonstrating etc., there\nare many postgraduates\nwho are worse off than\ntheir fellow undergraduates. U.G.' s in London\nshould receive \u00a315 per\nweek, assuming a30 week\nyear with \u00a31 per week in\nvacations, compared to a postgraduate \u00a312.30 per\nweek for a52 week year.\nThis comparison is admittedly unfair to U.G.' s, as\nmany don't receive all they should, and many\ncan't live for \u00a31 per week\nin vacations (who can!),\nbut the fact remains that\nthe Government thinks\nthat that is how the situation is.\nThe main reason that\nU.G.' s are apparent y better off is the existence of\na London Allowance for\nthem. All P.G. respondents who took their first\ndegrees outside London\nare agreed that student\ncosts in London are significantly higher than out-side. There is a good case\nfor a London Allowance\nfor P.G.' s in addition to a nationwide review of P.G. awards.\nThe Ashby Report in\n1960 recommended that a studentship should be sufficiently high to allow \" a standard of living rather\nhigher than that enjoyed\nby most undergraduates\nof comparable ability.\"\nThis appears to be the\ncase in Canada and Australia, and to quote from\none questionnaire: \"living\nin London is much more\nexpensive than living in\nBrisbane, Australia, yet\nAustralia P.G.' s on Australian Government scholarships receive about the\nequivalent of \u00a31400 p.a. before demonstrating or\ntutoring payments. In\nother words, they can do more than just exist\nwhilst undertaking P.G. studies.\"\nContinued on page 3\n\n"

Whatever you think, a fuller\ndiscussion of P.G. views\nwill be very useful.\nApart from the financial problems of P.G.' s whilst healthy, the situation could be far worse if\nthey suffered injury during their course. Postgraduate students are not insured against accident\nduring their course of studies at I.C. The College\nCalender gives the following information.\n\" The college authorities\naccept no liability for accidents to students while\npursuing any part of their\ncourse . . . . and they recommend that students\nshould take steps to insure\nthemselves against a cci dents. Postgraduate stu-dents, particularly if mar-ried, are advised to contribute to National Insurance.\"\nIf any week a postgraduate undertakes paid de-mon st rating, a contribution is made by the college\nfor injury insurance, and\nhe is then covered against\ninjury whilst he is demon-st rating, but at no other\ntime. If a student does\ncontribute to the National\nInsurance Scheme (at a cost of \u00a351.48 p.a.) he\nreceives scarcely any benefits while a student.\nWhat the student\nis most likely to need is\nsome form of sickness or\ninjury benefit. As a non-employed person he\nwould not be eligible for\nthis . under the National\nInsurance scheme.\nIt is the S. R.C.'s normal practice, when a student is away from work\nowing to illness or injury,\nto continue his studentship\nat the full rate of pay for\nthe first four weeks and\nat half rate for the next\nfour weeks. After that the student must depend on\nhis savings, his family, or\nas a last resort, social se-curit y.A student who\npermanently injures himself in the course of his\nstudies can obtain no compensation unless he has\nhimself taken out a personal injury policy or can\nprove that the injury resulted from another per-son's negligence. In the\nlatter case he could obtain\ncompensation by sue ing the college but this is a lengthy and costly bus i ness. Clearly great hardship could easily arise.\nThe reputation of Imperial College depends very\nmuch on the quantity and\nthe quality of research\nthat is carried out there.\nThe college receives large\nresearch contracts and\ngrants from industry and\nthe government.

It is high time\nthat the college authorities\nrecognise the value of\npostgraduate work and\nprovide insurance cover\nfor all postgraduates\nwhilst working at Imperial College.\nSome of the other topics\nto be discussed are the\nprovision of more coffee\nservices and common\nrooms, the standard of ca-te ring, the leak of U.

UGM |\nTHURSDAY13.001\nGreat Hall\nC \u00a9CICROACH\nADDENDA\nBy our Entomological Affairs Reporter\nLast week FELIX revealed that the cockroach and\nmouse problem in halls and refectories had reached\nsuch epidemic proportions that it was necessary for the\ncollege to spend 0,350 on cleaning the kitchens to try\nand rid IC of its unwanted menu additions (see RCS Broadsheet \"Mice Pie\" edition).\nIMMUNE Both Mr. Mooney and\nDr. Levy (respectively\nCollege Catering Manager\nand Chairman of the Refectory Committee) regarded the infestation as small\nin comparison with other\nareas of Kensington. Mice were hard to get rid of,\nthey said, as one cannot\nuse mouse poisons near\nfood; cockroaches on the\nother hand are fairly easy\nto get rid of, providing\none changes the poisons\nregularly as they become\nimmune after a while.\nLOW INFESTATION Mr. Erskine, Public\nRelations Officer for the\nRoyal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, said\nthat the mouse problem\nin South Ken. was no different from any other part\nof the borough but that\ncertain districts had a higher infestation. These\nwere Redcliffe, Brompton\nRoad and Earl's Court.\nThe Gloucester Road to\nExhibition Road area was\nbelow the average for\nSouth Ken. The main reasons for the increase in the\nrodent population, he con-tin u ed, were the drop in popularity of cats as pets,\nthe proliferation of bed-sits with individual kitchens and the increase of\nresistance to poisons.\nLEFT TOGO A spokesman from the\nInstitute of Cleaning\nScience who is also a member of the Hotel, Catering\nand Institutional Management Association (the\nself-explanatory professional bodies for the catering trade) said that it was\ninexcusable for a catering\nestablishment in this day and age to have any pest\ninfestation whatsoever,\nand particularly so in young buildings like IC. Provided the kitchen and\nrefectory areas had regular routine cleaning, occasional checks by the local\nHealth Officer and that\nthe Pest Infestation Officer\nis called in at the first sign\nof cockroaches or mice\n(recommended catering\npractice) then there would\nnot be any problem at all at IC. For a sum as large\nas \u00a33,350 to need to Se spent on disinfecting Hie\nrefectories, in c1u ding steam cleaning and wall\nwashing, means that the\nkitchens were obviously\njust left to go.\nPOSITIVE DANGER Mr. Mooney as College\nCatering Manager is the\none responsible for the\nhygiene of the kitchens\nand refectories and so\nought to have ensured\nthat the problem never\nreached the proportions of\ntoday. Not only are cockroaches generally unwelcome in Yorkshire Pu d, but in the words of the\nspokesman from the ICS:\" Any pest infestation in an area where food is being prepared or consumed\npositively endangers the\nhealth of the staff and cus-to mers\".

That just about sums up the annual circus\nthat goes under the name of the English National cross\ncountry championships, ft is a grand race to watch,\nbut an awful race to run in.\nThis year this event took place on Saturday, 3rd March at Parliament Hill Fields, North London and\nthe course was surprisingly dry for the time of year\u2014\nquite different from its usual state where one walks\naround up to the knees in muck (and bullets???!), f'm sure the organisers must have slipped up and didn't order the mud in time. The Championships consist of\nthree races, youths, juniors and seniors and, surprise,\nsurprise IC had runners in all three and actually finished a team (of four) in the Junior event. R. Allinson\n.(I'm sure he's not still under 18) represented us in the\n4 mile youth event. The six mile Junior event got underway at 2.30 and the I.C. team consisting of D. Payne, J. Kalivay, P. Johnson, and P. Donnelly surged\naway to a good start . . . and then slowed to a nice easy\njog\u2014as all I.C. runners do.* Pad and Pete eventually\nreturned home at about 3.15 just in time to see the\nmain event of the afternoon begin\u2014the 9 mile senior\nevent.\nThe procedure for starting this race is to fire a maroon (loud bang) 5 minutes before the start and\nthen fire another one five minutes later to start the\nrace. This year there were 1200 starters, including\nDave Bedford, a New Zealand team (who we\nshall hear more about later) & two runners from I.C. When the second bang went off we all shot off up the\nhill at a pace that would do any 4 minute miler\nproud, minding any rubbish bins, park benches, trees\netc. that happened to get in the way. And that is about\nall I remember of the race\u2014the rest being rather a blur\nexcept for the rest of the I.C. team and our captain\ntv/ho incidentally didn't run because he'd forgotten his\nshoes \u2014 a likely story) shouting (and laughing) at us\nas we did the three laps of the course.\nThe results of the race (as told to me\u2014I missed it,\nI still had another 2 miles to go) was R. Dixon of New\nZealand 1st, beating Dave Bedford by about 13 sees.,\nS. Littlewood and S. Webb of I.C.763 and 766 res-pec t iv ely. This New Zealander caused untold confusion as he was not supposed to be there anyway but was\njust a guest\u2014so Dave Bedford won after all, but he\ndidn't really, or did he? I don't know it was all too\nconfusing for me.\nSo a tired little band of I.C. runners returned to a certain house of refreshment at South Kensington,\nconsoled, by the thought that on the Wednesday following was a league race and we would once again be\nrunning against athletes of our own class. Little did\nwe know . . . .\nOn Wednesday the last league race was held at I.C's. home course at Richmond Park. Three of the International New Zealand team came, taking the first three\nplaces, the winner breaking the course record by 30s. to make it 25m.33s.( for 5J miles) I.C. was there with\nthe usual team of varied talents Rob Parker made his\ncomeback? Almost beating Paul Clarke, but neither\nwere quick enough to beat Rob All in son who was\nfirst back for I.C. in 26th place with 29-48. Dave Payne\nand Stuart Littlewood were not far behind (43rd and\n48th) than J. Kaliray (know body knows his christian\nname) and Dave Jones (72nd and 76th). Pete Johnson and Pad Donnelly also ran in this race and achieved the usual good placings with 95th and 96th. Anyone looking over the parapet of Putney Bridge\non Wednesday would have seen, besides the odd oil\nslick and lump of driftwood, 20 college boats and the\ndynamic Tyrian (U.L. II), marshalling for the start\nof the U.L. Head of the River Race. For non-rowing\nreaders, a Head race is one in which the crews set off\nat approximately 10 second intervals and are timed\nover a set distance, in this case the Boat Race course\nfrom Putney to Mortlake (4\u00a3 miles), the winner\nbeing the crew returning the fastest time. The race.is\nsplit up into divisions (in this case, Open, Junior and\nNovice) with the crews' starting order determined by\nthe previous years results.\nTyrian, although not officially part of the race (not\nbeing a college), duly lined up in front of the field for\ntheir annual ego trip. Just behind them were the I. C.1st VIII, having won the event last year. I.C.'s recent rise\nto prominence had obviously got around and the open\ndivision was sadly lacking in numbers. (Although\nthere were some surprisingly fast Junior crews).\nThe race finally got underway with I.C. chasing Tyrian. The water was quite rough for the first mile\nthroughout which the I.C. cox kept yelling something\nabout Tyrian having only 6ft. of clear water. Having heard it all before, the rest of the crew decided that\nTyrian must be disappearing under Hammersmith\nBridge. It was with great surprise that, on reaching the\ncalmer water above the Mile Post and risking a quick\nglance over their shoulders, the rest of the crew found\nthe cox was telling the truth. The two crews were\nlevel by Harrods and stayed like that for the next\nmile. During this period both crews gave everything\nthey had and in between giving tens and answering\nthe others tens, all one had time to do was to decide\nwhich side of the boat to be sick over next. This intensive rowing could not continue, and just as the Tyrian cox was telling his crew that I.C. were going to\nblow up, his own crew began to drop back. I.C. got \\\\.\nin one of their tens and after that, soon broke contact.\nFrom this point on, I.C. slowly went away from Tyrian\nalthough they did hit a half submerged railway sleeper\nand a nasty wash from a string of barges.\nThe final positions put I.C.21 seconds in front of\nTyrian and an enormous lm.53 sec. in front of the\nthird crew, St. Thomas's Hospital.\nThe 2nd VIII, rowing in the Junior division came\nsecond behind U.C. The other star performance was\nby the IV th VIII. This crew was made up of fresher\nnovices who have only been rowing since September. In\none of the best rows ever by an I.C. fresher novice crew\nthey won the Novice division by almost 2 minutes over\nseveral much more experienced crews. If this crew\nstays together and improves as it should, they should\nhave little difficulty in picking up their Novices in the\nSummer.\nAs for the 1st VIII, their performance was exceptional. For the first time in years all the winter training and ground work had been done, due in part to\nI.C's. National Squad members. They go to Bedford\non Saturday to try and win the colleges pennant but\nthe example set and encouragement given by some of\ntheir main hopes must lie in the Summer regattas.\nPhoto: The Observer,4 March,1973 KODAK1, LC.1 st XI2 This was I.C.'s final league match of the season\nplayed at Kodak's ground in Harrow. Again John Antley took a chance and travelled alone by scooter, finally arriving with some minutes of the match having\nbeen played. His explanation is that his clutch cable\nbroke or something like that, but we know he got lost\nagain.\nDuring the match one of Kodak's players was\nordered off the field for five minutes for trying to\nstrangle Heineken Downs \u2014 better luck next time.\nKodak.\nI.C.2, PRESIDENT'S XI1On Sunday, the 1st XI completed the weekend double with a very shaky win over the President's XI at\nHarlington. Before the match the I.C. team went\nthrough its usual trials and tribulations. Heineken\nbooked a coach for 1.30 which arrived at 11.30 a.m. and left because nobody was ready to leave. So the\nmatch started half-an-hour late after a trip via Hou n slow West.\nThe first half was completely dominated by the President's XI. Although they peppered the goal from all\nangles, most of the shots were hastily taken and easily\ncleared. The goal I.C. scored in the first half was our\nonly direct shot of that half. Jag Gahir broke through\non a solo run, and with the goal at his mercy Jules\nSargeant clobbered him giving away a penalty flick,\nwhich Jag somewhat luckily converted.\nThe second half was more even and Colin Townsley\nhad a little more to keep him warm in the President's goal. I.C.'s second goal\u2014one of our best movements\nof the season \u2014 came after ten minutes of this half.\nJag Gah ir picked up the ball on the President's twenty-five, went to the right and gave a reverse stick pass to\nthe top of the circle where Chris Gankroger immediately passed it out to the right of the D for Heineken to\ncrack in first time.\nPredictably this encouraged the President's XI to\npick up their game and they nearly scored after a movement on the right led to a shot by Jules Sargeant\nat least four feet off the ground. However, after it easily\nbeat Sid Boulton, Richard Cameron made a fine save\non the line. The President's goal finally came from a low hard shot by Colin Ringrase from their one short\ncorner.\nTeams: \u2014 Sid Boulton; Simon Tyrrell, Richard\nCameron; Graham Popple, Alan Brown, Dick Whittington; Heineken Downs, Chris Gankroger, Jag Gahir,\nDave Richman, John Astley.\nColin Townsly, Mick Burt, Ron Palmer; Martin Field, Julian Sargeant, Colin Ringrese; John Manning,\nIan Tasney, Pete Bates, James Comyn, Dave Richards.\nUmpires: Dave Browne, Ed Castell.\nI.C. MIXED XI vs HESTON MIXED XII. C.3, Hestoh 1\nDespite having their ranks depleted by the call of\nthe first team, I.C. Mixed team soldiered on to yet\nanother victory. Although they deserved to win, I.C. never really dominated a match which was spoilt by\nthe pettiness of some of the Heston players. The first\nhalf was very one-sided with I.C. on the attack almost\ncontinuously. However, half-time arrived with the score\nstill 0\u20140. After a dynamic pep-talk during the interval I.C. started the second half in a much more resolute manner and very quickly opened the scoring. A run by WB2 ended with Chris Brown putting the ball\nin the back of the net. Shortly after this WB2 added a second with a devastating ly solo effort. I.C. continued\nto apply all the pressure but the next goal was scored\nby Heston following a quick breakaway, which split the\nI.C. defence and left the goalkeeper with no chance.\nHeston never really looked like scoring again and when\nWB2 added a third goal the final score became more\nrepresentative of the overall play.\nTeam: Jerry Heffer; Pete Foxton, Julie ( O AP); Jacqui Buzzard, Tim Hansen, Anne Purvis; Blossom,\nWB2, Chris Brown, Adrian Evans, Geraldine Bowden.\nSee Felix diary for this week's coming events.\n\n"

There are meaningful questions outside science to extend your mind, and one example\nshown above is taken from the wall of the beer\npressure relieve r at Silwood Park, that well-known\ncountry haven of Imperial College.\nAfter the Flintstones came the Touchstones, and\nafter the Touchstones came me. A college career\nof idle curiosity almost behind me, I dared venture\nforth to brain-crippling pursuits elsewhere.\n\"This is your last chance, son, take it and they'll\nmake a man of you.\"\nMy curiosity has been satisfied, I now know that\nI should never have gone to Touchstone. Had I gone\nin my first, my second, or even early in my third\nyear, it would have been a good idea, but all in all\nthe experience is far too enjoyable for anyone to go\nif they will not have the chance to go again.\nThe \"coach load of p seu ds\" can be simply\ndivided into two parts, those who go to take an\nactive part in the discussion and those who go because a weekend of good food, good drink and\ngood surroundings appeals to them. Both groups\nreturned well satisfied. The latter group slept off\ntheir vices during the discussion. They missed a lot.\nAt the last Touchstone we were graced with two\nguest speakers who promoted discussion on the\nsubject of \"Human Rights\", a subject so widespread in relevance that everybody got a chance to\nmount their own personal hobby-horse. The two\nspeakers were Professor Raphael, Director of Associated Studies at Imperial College (in case you\ndidn't know) and Professor Costa, of the University\nof Rome. Unfortunately Professor Costa was banned\nfrom achieving the full potential of his contribution\nby virtue of language difficulties, but Professor\nRaphael's expert handling of the discussion and\nwillingness to supply Professor Costa with the mot\njust e at necessary times much ground was covered\nin keen discussion. I at least felt that I had seen\nmany different points of view which I had never\npreviously considered.\nThe discussion centred around the \"Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights\" adopted by the\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations on December 10th,1948. Each member country of the United\nNations is now pledged to \"cause the text of the\nDeclaration to be disseminated, displayed, read and\ncompounded principally in schools and other educational institutions, without distinction based on\nthe political status of countries or territories\".\nThink about the implications of that. Interesting?\nThen Touchstone is for you also. Boring? Then Professor Raphael and Mr. McDowell are back in College Block and keen to hear what you would\nlike out of General Studies. I would like to have\nbeen persuaded to go to Touchstone sooner. Oh! In\ncase you're worried, then Touchstoners are a friendly bunch too, but watch out for the Australian\nsnooker player . . . he'll beat you.\nDAVE SUGDEN Le Bristol 24 Heures\nAfter a lifetime of considering the eternal un answerable \" What is Life?\",\" Is there a purpose?\",\" What do We mean?\" I have, finally, discarded philosophy, for I have discovered a question more\nprofound than any of these, \u2014 deeper and harder\nto discern even than the immortal \" Why?\" If I can find an answer to this question, I will die a happy\nman \u2014 but I fear I never shall. My question? \" Why do people compete in 2 4 Hour Pedal Car Races?\" The 8 th National Pedal Car Race was held at\nWhitchurch Airfield last week-end (3 p.m. Friday \u2014\n3 p.m. Saturday), and as last year, I.C. sent three\ncars \u2014 two from guilds (Hurrah, Rah-Rah-Rah,\nboo male ka,boom a la \u2014 oops, sorry, forgot I was meant to be impartial) and one from Mine s.Un fortunately the former Guilds Class I car \" Little Bo\" got nicked around Christmas time, so a new car\n(completed two minutes before the race) was built\nfor this class, and\" Big Bo\" made his( her?) usual\nappearance, with the crankshaft coming unstuck the\nstandard number of times. Mines car \" St rika lite'' was Class I category, (Runner-up to \" Little Bo\" last\nyear) \u2014 the same car as last year, in fact, with the\nsame unmistakable clatter of the forward \" fairing\"( a word I use in the broadest possible sense).\nThe race was started with the customary \" Le Mans\" type start ( N.B. Male Newman waving hat in\nlast week's Felix) and most of the 8 0 or so entrants\nwere soon rattling gleefully around the 5 0 0 yard\ncourse. The boys from Hele's School, Exeter, were,\nas ever, showing very promisingly in their superb\nClass II cars \" Claudette\" and\" Clare\" \u2014 though\nthey seemed to lack some of their former elan (now\nthere's an ideal). Big Bo started nicely, and Mines TAX Sheffield University students' Union has recently sent me a letter giving information\nabout one of the proposed changes in the taxation system.\nIt has been suggested that Family Allowances and tax allowances for children should\nbe replaced by a single tax credit which is\ngiven to the father. Students are excluded\nfrom the tax credit system and so students at\npresent receiving Family Allowances may lose\nthis income.\nIf you would like to support the Child Poverty Action Group campaign for payment of\nChild credits to the mother, in the same way\nas Family Allowances are at present, the address to write to is: Child Poverty Action\nGroup, 1 Macklin Street, Drury Lane, London\nW C2B5N H. If you prefer you may write direct to: The\nClerk, Select Committee on Tax Credits,\nHouse of Commons, London SW1.\nI hope this information is of use to some of\nyou.\nJENNY ROGERS\nI.C.U.

I won't mention the Guild's positions (largely\nbecause I don't have them), but their lowness was very largely due to the surprisingly long time spent\nin the Pits.\n\" Didn't you sleep at all?\"\" Not a wink.\"\" Why no names, Bob?\"\" There are too many.\" BOB CARTER ICU FLATS\nAt present Imperial College Union rents twelve flats\nin Hamlet Gardens, Ravenscourt Park, W6, and one\nflat in Cambridge Gardens, Ladbroke Grove, sub-letting\nthese to its members. The flats house eighty-nine students in total, seven at Cambridge Gardens, and the rest\nat Hamlet Gardens in flats of varying sizes, the majority\naccommodating seven persons. All the flats are self-contained with a lounge, kitchen and bathroom(s). Rents, considering there is no subsidy, are competitive,\nelectricity and gas being extra at the standard rate. The lease for the property at Hamlet Gardens is subject,\nunfortunately, to annual negotiation. This, of course,\nenables the landlords to demand a higher rental each\ntime, however, in view of the 1 0 % increase last year\nand the better prospects for summer letting, it is reasonably certain that rents will remain at the same level.\nNothing need be said here about the grants situation,\nsave that any increase in flat rental would be extremely\nunwelcome, especially as the cost of non-College accommodation will no doubt make its usual upward movement next session.\nEconomically it is crucial that the scheme does not\nfinish its second year in the red, as it did its mis-man-aged first. As electricity and gas are now paid for by\nthose who use them, the only possible source of deficit\nis the rent. This year rents were evaluated on the basis\nof a forty-eight week year\u2014that is we could have all flats standing empty for four weeks and just break\neven. The only time that this could possibly happen\nis over the summer vacation, hence, it has been decided\nto offer anybody occupying a place over the vacation\na place next session, providing they apply by the end\nof the week. This offer may be extended indefinitely\ndepending on demand. Another way to achieve full\noccupancy over the summer is to let to non-members\nof the Union\u2014this was done last year, but only to a small extent. Needless to say, Union members will\nhave preference. Any surplus could be used in a number of ways, probably the most constructive being to\noffset future rent increases.\nAs far as letting s next session are concerned, the\nallocation of places will be made in the fairest possible\nmanner, that of first come first served. However, group\napplications for whole flats will be favoured as experience has shown that such flats are more desirable in\nall aspects than those randomly filled. In order to avoid\na repeat of the chaos last summer, person or persons\naccepting the offer of a room or flat will be required\nto cancel immediately any application for Hall or\nHouse. Transfer of places is in general not a fair practice when there is a waiting list, so except in special\ncases this will not be permitted.\nApplication forms for vacation al and session al letting\nand further details of rents, etc., are available now from\nthe Union Office. Applications will be accepted indefinitely in view of the possibility of further flats being available next session, but a large demand is expected, so\nremember that early applications will be favoured.\n\n"
