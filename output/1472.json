    "content": "FELIX\n22\nMUSIC\nMusic Editors: Greg Power\nLuke Turner\nChristopher Walmsley\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nHow could a gig featuring a children\u2019s\nchoir, the Britten Sinfonia and a man\nsmashing melons in the name of music\nbe anything other than sublime?\nThese New Puritans (TNP) had felt\nthat people were never quite sure what\nto do at their gigs. Should they mosh,\ndance, or just stand and admire wist-fully? When composer Andr\u00e9 De Ridder\napproached TNP about performing their\nwidely acclaimed second album Hidden,\nthe problem was solved. The result was\nthis performance at the Barbican where\nthe band would be joined not only by\nthe brass and woodwind of the Britten\nSinfonia, but by a childrens choir and\nFoley artists armed with everything\nfrom swords to Tycho drums and the\naforementioned melons.\nFront man Jack Barnett was the only\ndetractor from what was an otherwise\nperfect performance of Hidden\u2019s am-bitious, beat driven, classically influenced Art Rock. He was apparently in\nthe midst of a throat infection which\nexplains the exceptionally quiet vocals.\nThe higher notes on \u2018Orion\u2019 were terribly strained and I found myself feeling\na little anxious that he would choke up\ncompletely. As a front man, though, he\nwas very much a cross between Thom\nYorke and Gollum from Lord of the\nRings: nervy stomping, gangly and\ndeep in the music. As a fan of both Radiohead and Tolkien, this came some\nway to making up for a weaker vocal\nperformance.\nThe ferocious single \u2018Attack Music\u2019 was a highlight with Jack\u2019s vocals\nbacked hauntingly by the children\u2019s\nchoir and the sharpening swords of the\nFoley artists. \u2018Hologram\u2019 was the tenderest song off the album and made for a\nbeautiful live performance.\nSupport came from Darkstar who\nhad brought in a singer to create their\nlatest album \u2018North\u2019 and take them\naway from the dubstep for which they\nare famed. The performance has elements of Dubstep but was very much a\nsomber affair: not the kind of stuff that\nwould be played at club. The mood was\nsuch that a dubstep-tinged cover of the\ngloriously sparse Radiohead\u2019s \u2018Videotape\u2019 sat well alongside their own ma-terial.\nAlthough not the best gig I\u2019ve ever\nbeen to, it was still an outstanding per-formance. The album is a delight and\nseeing performed live so faithfully reaffirmed that it should have been nominated for the Mercury Prize.\nThese New Puritans join\nwith Britten Sinfonia at The\nBarbican to riotous success\nTNP & Britten Sinfonia\nThe Barbican\n23rd October\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nJames Gollings\nJack Barnett: bastard offspring\nof Thom Yorke and Gollum\nIt\u2019s a dark, windswept Saturday night\nin October \u2013 Mischief Night, as some\ncall it \u2013 and outside the Hammersmith\nApollo waits a rabble of youths in band\nshirts and beardy old men with bad\ntattoos. It\u2019s the first concert of A7X\n& Stone Sour\u2019s Halloween weekend\ndouble bill!\nKicking off the show was Hellyeah,\na metal supergroup from Texas. They\nproved to be a lot of fun, with songs like\n\u2018Alcohaulin\u2019 Ass\u2019 and \u2018Cowboy Way\u2019\nchannelling the spirit of Pantera. Vinnie Paul, drummer, invited us to throw\nthe horns for his late brother Dimebag,\nwhich was nice.\nNext up, Stone Sour delivered a thoroughly awesome performance that rivalled the headliners\u2019. Corey Taylor was\nhis usual fire-breathing yet slightly emotional self, and gave us a solo serenade\nwith an acoustic guitar midway through.\nThis led into \u2018Through Glass\u2019, the\nmuch-appreciated singalong of the eve-ning; other highlights included \u2018Made of\nScars\u2019 and \u201830/30-150\u2019, whose considerable heaviness gave drummer Roy Mayorga a chance to shine. Fewer verbose\ninterludes from Corey might have been\nan improvement, though\u2026\nFinally, it was time for the main act,\nwhom all the dirty-haired angstyboppers\nhad been waiting for. They didn\u2019t disap-point; from \u2018Nightmare\u2019 through \u2018Critical Acclaim\u2019 via oldie \u2018Unholy Confessions\u2019, the guitars sounded sweet and M\nShadows strolled across the stage like it\nwas his own \u2013 which, voice on form, it\nwas. Halfway through, oversized-drum-kit pioneer (and genuinely excellent\nDream Theater drummer, Mike Portnoy) left his stool and we were invited\nto remember the late Jimmy Sullivan, or\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of these guys yet,\nit\u2019s about time. The Cat Empire flew\nall the way from Aussie land to grace us\nwith their spirit-lifting mix of jazz, ska,\nrock and everything in between. I seriIt\u2019s been a whirlwind 18 months for\nWilder, Bristol\u2019s hippest Indie offering\nfor years. Since they\u2019ve been scooped\nby Rough Trade records and toured with\nJulian Casablancas and The Maccabees, intimate pub gigs such as tonight\nin Kentish Town\u2019s The Flowerpot will\nsurely soon be a thing of the past .\nI barely had time to buy a pint when a\ndiminutive figure takes a seat behind her\ndrum kit and starts beating out an infectious rhythm heralding the start of the\ngig. As she pounds the skins, vocalist\nSam snakes his way to the stage, urging everyone to get on their feet. The\nmessage is clear, they want everyone\ndancing, and all it takes is 30 seconds of\nopener \u2018White Noise\u2019before everyone is\npushing to the front.\nOlder singles \u2018TBT\u2019 and \u2018Girls Vs\nBoys\u2019 provoked the loudest cheers but\nevery new track packed full of soaring\nsynths and cutting guitars wows the\ncrowd. For such a new band (and despite the bass cab blowing up halfway\nthrough) the set is surprisingly tight but\nwith only 30 minutes on stage and no\nsupport acts, the crowd are left wanting.\nIn a flash it\u2019s all over, leaving onlookers to creep sluggishly back to their\nseats, but an impression has certainly\nbeen made. Wilder\u2019s electronica fused\nindie may not be the most original\nsound of the moment but their talent to\nplay live is undeniable; one of the best\nbands I\u2019ve seen for a long time and\nhighly recommended.'\nAvenged Sevenfold + Stone\nSour + Hellyeah\nHammersmith Apollo\n30th October 2010\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nEliot Barford\nThe Cat Empire\nO2 Brixton Academy\n23rd October 2010\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nKatherine Portilla\nously left the gig with cheeks sore from\nsmiling and feet tired from dancing.\nDespite a mellow and hence, oddly\nplaced open act from Tinpan Orange\n- an acoustic trio of sorts similarly\nfrom Australia - as soon as The Cat\nEmpire set foot on stage the crowd\nwas theirs. Never have I seen an audience clap and move with such enthu-siasm.\nIf in the past you have ever been left\ndisappointed after watching a live act,\nI prescribe you these Melbourne boys.\nA beautifully orchestrated set, not only\nfocusing on songs from their new album Cinema, but instead reaching a\nperfect compromise between hits from\ntheir previous albums and their great\nnew material. Old favorites such as\n\u2018Hello\u2019 and \u2018Two Shoes\u2019 had the crowd\ngoing mental, generating a unanimous\nfeeling of euphoria which defines\nThe Cat Empire\u2019s music. In between\nsongs, we were treated to an array of\nsolos, from an insane 6 minute drum\nsolo to some sick scratching from the\nband\u2019s very own turntables paired with\nbeat box-style vocals. Not only do they\nmesh together raw talent somewhat mi-raculously, The Cat Empire have an\nundeniable skill to interact with, or perhaps better yet said, charm the crowd.\nIn short, I recommend this band to\nanyone in search of that special, yet\nindescribable sound we often lack on\nour iPods nowadays. You will find music that can truly put a smile on your\nface, all the while making you feel like\ngetting up and grooving to the tune. If\nyou do come across an opportunity to\nsee The Cat Empire live I assure you\nit is an experience gained, not money\nspent.\nWilder\nThe Flowerpot\n26th October 2010\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nAlex Malcolm\nThe Rev, who died last December, leaving the demos from which A7X\u2019s latest\nalbum was assembled. We all sang \u2018So\nFar Away\u2019and \u2018Afterlife\u2019in his memory.\nThen to top it all off, the crowd chose\nclassic \u2018Bat Country\u2019 for the finale,\nwhich was frantic to say the least.\nAll in all, with an excited crowd and\nconsistently good sound, it was a gig I\u2019ll\nremember. For fans of melodic, heavy\nrock music, both groups are highly rec-ommended.\nThe Cat Empire: these pussy cats are pretty damn horny. AMIRIGHT? HUH? Anyone...?\nFriday 5 NOVEMBer 2010\n\n"

    "content": "10 felix\nTECHNOLOGY\nTechnology Editor: Samuel Gibbs\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nN\not all microphones are born\nequal; some are infinitely more\nequal than others. That\u2019s certainly the case with the THX\ncertified Yeti from renowned\nUSB microphone manufacturer Blue.\nThe \u00a3100 Yeti is the top of the range, all sing-ing, all dancing USB microphone that claims\nto be able to do it all. Featuring not one, not\ntwo, but three condenser capsules (they\u2019re the\nbits that actually pick up your dulcet tones) in\na proprietary \u2018Tri-Capsule Array\u2019, the Yeti is\ncertainly capable of dealing with almost everything you\u2019re likely to throw at it in the audible\nspectrum.\nIn reality what that means is that the Yeti\ncan operate in one of four separate polar pat-terns: stereo, bi-directional, omni-directional\nand cardioid (which is what you\u2019re likely to\nend up using the most). Cardioid essentially\nfocuses in on audio that\u2019s coming from directly in front of the microphone, blocking\nout any audio from behind it and allowing you\nto get in nice and close for the ultimate \u2018radio\nvoice\u2019 effect.\nThe other microphone modes allow you to\ncapture multi-point sources in more detail,\nwith stereo perfect for recording a band, bidirectional for one-on-one interviews and\nomni-directional for recording a group around\na table. In fact having used all of the separate\nmodes in the course of creating many pod-casts, we can attest to the versatility of the\nYeti.\nThe Yeti also has on-board mic gain control,\nwhich allows you to fine tune the recording input directly from the microphone, something\nthat can be really useful if you\u2019ve got variable\nsources or you\u2019re having trouble getting the\nlevels right. Blue have also thought to include\na zero latency direct monitoring headphone\nport on the mic complete with it\u2019s own amplifier and volume control. That means that if you\nneed to listen to the recording as you\u2019re making\nit you don\u2019t have to be tethered to your computer and experience the lag that going through the\ncomputer and back might induce. In fact you\ncan output all your computer\u2019s sound through\nthe Yeti\u2019s headphone port, allowing you to sit\na decent way away from your computer with\nonly the mic close to you, reducing any potential background noise a close by computer\nmight make.\nThe microphone is suspended on a table-top stand that can be locked at any angle you\nneed. The stand is quite hefty, supporting the\nrelatively heavy microphone and also providing the Yeti some protection when stored by\nletting it fold back in on itself. If you want to\nuse your own mic stand the Yeti has a standard\nthreaded mic stand mount on the bottom next\nto the mini-USB port.\nYou might think that \u00a3100 for a USB mic is a\nlot to pay and you\u2019d be right. You can pick up\na cheap headset for around the \u00a310 mark these\ndays and for the majority of people, that will\ndo them fine. However, if you\u2019re serious about\ntaking vocal or musical recordings directly into\nyour computer, if you\u2019re a podcaster or musician for instance, then you simply can\u2019t get a\nbetter USB mic at the moment.\nOf course it\u2019s not perfect (what is?), we\ndon\u2019t like the wobbly plastic master volume\nknob, and admittedly it\u2019s a pretty large tool to\nhave sitting on your desk, but when it comes\nto sound quality, ease of use and that illusive\nbaritone that is the \u2018radio voice\u2019the Yeti comes\nsecond to none.\nFree App of the Week\niOS - Layar for iPhone\nAugmented reality, or AR, promises to be a huge thing\ngoing forward. Layar makes it a reality now, painting\ninformation over a camera feed, just like Terminator.\nThe iPhone 4 is a svelte piece of product de-sign, with immaculate lines and a glossy, beautiful finish. Like it or loathe it, no one can deny\nthat it is a gorgeous piece of hardware and,\nwith it costing up to \u00a3600, you probably want\nto keep it that way.\nIn steps Scosche with its take on the thin rubber iPhone 4 case. The glosSEE g4 comes in\ntwo colours, glossy black and colourless see-through plastic, but surprisingly you get both\nin one box.\nThe cases themselves are pretty plain, being made from one piece of a semi-flexible\nrubber that fits snugly around the outside of\nyour iPhone. It offers your pocket-pal decent\nscratch protection for all but the screen, sadly\nthere\u2019s no included screen protector in the box,\nbut its impact protection is fairly minimal. On\nthe bright side the material the Scosche is made\nfrom isn\u2019t of the super-grippy variety which\nmeans that getting your iPhone into and out of\na pocket in the case is actually possible, but at\nthe same time it\u2019s not going to slip out of your\nhand.\nThe clear case allows you to see the industrial design of the iPhone 4 fairly well, with the\nonly blemish being a relatively small Scosche\nlogo on the back towards the bottom. Access to\nthe camera, mute switch, dock connector and\nspeakers are decent, whilst the volume buttons\nare covered but easily activated.\nOverall the Scosche glosSEE g4 is an above\naverage case that provides enough protection\nin the pocket and out on a table, but its thin\nand slippery enough to get in and out of pockets easily.\nClear iPhone 4 Protection\nSamuel Gibbs\nLayar for Android came first, and like its iOS brother,\nallows both free and paid AR overlays for all sorts of\nthings.\nAndroid - Layar for Android\nCan you hear me now?\nSamuel Gibbs goes hands on with the ultimate \u2018radio\nvoice\u2019USB microphone, the unusually named Blue Yeti\nFriday 05 November 2010\n\n"

The \u2018Funding our\nFuture\u2019 rally is being organized by the National Union of Students and\nUniversity and College Union and is intended to defend education from\nthese \u2018devastating cuts\u2019.\nTo offset the 40% cut in the university teaching budget announced\nin the Comprehensive Spending Review, education minister David Willetts announced on Tuesday that the cap on university fees will be\nraised to \u00a39,000.\nThe NUS argues that this will place an unfair burden onto the shoulders of students, who will already face hardship in the wake of reduced\ngovernment spending. NUS President Aaron Porter said: \u2018The Government\u2019s approach to funding our colleges and universities is short-sight-ed, illogical and unfair. Together we will let politicians know that we will\nnot tolerate their failure to fund our future.\u2019\nResponse to the rally from Imperial College Union has been luke-warm. President Alex Kendall said: \u201cwe do not yet have a stance on\nthe cuts [to higher education], as more information needs to be given\nas to where these cuts will fall.\u201d\nImperial College Union will be making students aware of the protest\nas they \u201cwelcome the maintenance in research funding which is vital\nfor research led teaching\u201d.

So on\nMonday 25th, the launch night of \u2018This is UK\nGrime Volume 1\u2019 took place at the Fenchurch\nstore in Covent Garden. It was a bit of a strange\nvenue if you ask me.\nWe were sceptical at first but when we got\nthere, they had turned the whole store into an\nintimate music venue. The cream of the UK\nGrime Scene were all on show, with the likes\nof members of Boy Better Know and other top\ngrime artists showed us what they had to offer\nand it was very impressive. The great mix of\ntunes and well thought lyrics made for some\ngreat music and the free bar went down a treat,\nwhich really got the music flowing. When we\nwere all booted out, the cameras came out and\npeople were MC\u2019ing on the street with passers\nby bemused at what they saw.\nThis is how grime has grown in the underground music world, with artists recording\ntheir tracks on small cameras and sticking\nthem on Youtube and creating mixtapes. Even\nthough it is now becoming more mainstream,\nthe essence of grime hasn\u2019t changed.

Chicago-based band Salem are hailed as the originators\nof this so-called \u2018genre\u2019, and have just released their\nfirst full-length \u2018King Night\u2019, collecting six new songs\nalongside five old favourites from their past singles\nand EPs. Regardless of hipsters debates, Salem have\nmade a genuinely brilliant, cohesive album, full of\ndense, atmospheric and interesting songs, they draw\nyou into a world that is Salem\u2019s alone. Most appropriately described as a downtempo, drugged-out fusion\nof industrial and noise-rock, it is an album that rewards repeated listens. Producer Dave Sardy cleans\nup the sound somewhat, bringing out hidden beauty\nlying underneath the layers of murky noise. The amazing \u2018Sick\u2019 and \u2018Trapdoor\u2019 feature freaky, downtuned\ndrawl-rapping reminiscent of The Knife\u2019s \u2018Hanging\nOut\u2019, but it is closer \u2018Killer\u2019 that floats my boat as one\nof the best tracks of the year.- Greg Power\nMost listened to\nthis week by\nFelix Music\nmembers on\nlast.fm\nMake sure not to miss\nThe Dillinger Escape Plan\nElectric Ballroom, Camden\nTonight!

Breaking out of New Jersey\nback in 1999 with their landmark release \u2018Calculating Infinity\u2019, these pioneers of insanely extreme\nmetal have spawned a legion of imitators.

Their unique style\nof inserting songs into songs and silence into\nmusic is what makes their album a definite\ncontester to any Top Albums of 2010 list.

He played a great selection of\nhis own music and it justified why he was in\nthe top 20 DJs in the world. His great mix of\nhouse and dance/electro really worked well and\nthe crowd really responded to what they were\nhearing. I definitely see him as an artist to look\nout for in future.\nLater that evening, the top 3 were announced.\nEven though Armin van Buuren was voted\nnumber 1, Deadmau5 played a fantastic set\nthat made me question why he was only at number 4! Some may disagree, but I really think he\ndeserved to be number 1. He really shone as a\ntop class DJ with all of his own remixes and\ntracks. His unique style was a hit with the fans,\nespecially the fact that he mixes all of his tracks\non the fly!\nIf you get a chance to see him live, I definitely recommend you go and see him. Funnily\nenough, he will be at Earls Court on the 18th\nDecember together with Magnetic Man and\nZane Lowe. Get your tickets quick!\nWent to a gig, four beautiful babes... AND THEN I JIZZED. IN.

    "content": "BUSINESS\nFELIX 11\nMidterm elections: what do\nthey mean for US businesses?\nAs the Republicans retake the House of Representatives, analysts debate whether\nthey will they ease the burden on businesses or let them down like it\u2019s 1994\nT\nuesday saw the US midterm\nelections, ending months of\nspeculation about the extent of predicted Democrat\nloses. These elections were\nseen as particularly important in determining the business environment in the\nworld\u2019s largest economy for at least the\nnext two years. The outcome will have\na major effect on the Obama administration\u2019s ability to pursue a number of\npolicies critical to the shape of any coming recovery or double dip. Analysts are\nespecially interested in what the results\nare likely to mean to the healthcare,\ndrilling and mining industries facing\nnew regulations, high-income taxpayers\nwhose \u2018tax holidays\u2019 will soon expire if\nnot renewed, as well as the federal government\u2019s fiscal policies and the Federal\nReserve\u2019s monetary response.\nRepublicans gained over sixty seats\nin the House of Representatives, winning a majority of around twenty seats.\nThis was an even larger swing than the\nfifty-four seats won in the so-called\n\u2018Republican revolution\u2019 of 1994, which\ngave the party control over both houses\nof congress.\nAnalogies with that election have\nbeen prevalent for months on American political talk-shows due to several\nsimilarities. Both have been seen as\nreactions against ambitious increases\nthe size of government pushed for by a\nfirst-term Democratic president. In both\ncases, Republicans have drawn up \u2018contracts\u2019 with their electorate, promising\nto roll back the size and scope of the\nstate if elected.\nDemocrats will have reason to hope\nthat the analogy does not end there. The\n1994 elections are widely credited with\nreturning Bill Clinton to popularity after over a year of low and falling poll\nnumbers. That had far more to do with\nthe Republicans, led by House speaker\nNewt Gingrich, being seen to completely abandon their promises of tax\nand spending cuts than any particular\ntriumph on the part of the Democratic\npresident. The Republicans\u2019 ability to\nstop Clinton from doing anything too\nunpopular, whilst also failing to enact much of their own \u2018contract,\u2019 led\nto Clinton\u2019s comfortable re-election in\n1996.\nDemocratic hopes are high that a\nsimilar failure by the Republicans, together with their abysmal field of likely\n2012 candidates, will stop Obama from\nbecoming the first one-term black presi-dent. The new speaker, John Boehner,\npromised in an emotional speech on\nWednesday morning that that will not\nhappen. Having already received a congratulatory phone call from Obama,\nwho told him of his hope to \u201cfind common ground\u201d with him, Boehner told\nsupporters that he would \u2018never\u2019 let\nthem down and that voters had sent\nthe president a message, that he should\n\u201cchange course\u201d. He also vowed to cut\nspending and reduce the size of gov-ernment, although his number-two in\nthe House, Eric Cantor, was unable to\nname a single government program that\nwould be cut, whilst both men have repeatedly called and voted for rises in\ndefence spending.\nDespite gaining six seats, the Republicans were unable to regain control of\nthe Senate. Whilst their 47 seats are\neasily enough for them to filibuster any\npiece of legislation, they were unable\nto secure a majority after several of the\ncraziest Tea Party candidates lost their\nraces. In perhaps the biggest surprise of\nthe night, Majority Leader Harry Reid\nfended off a challenge from Sharron\nAngle, a favourite of the social-conser-vative wing of the Tea Party. A delighted John Kerry commented that \u201cHarry\nReid isn\u2019t just Dracula, he isn\u2019t just\nLazarus, he\u2019s our leader and our whole\ncaucus is thrilled that he\u2019s unbreakable\nand unbeatable.\u201d\nKarl Rove, George Bush\u2019s former senior political advisor who raised $100\nmillion for Republican candidates in\nthis election cycle through five lobbying organisations, said that the party\u2019s\nbase should learn a lesson from the Delaware race, which turned from leaning-republican to a Democratic landslide,\nafter the establishment candidate was\nrejected in the Republican primaries\nin favour of a candidate who spent the\nremainder of her campaigning trying\nto convince voters that she was \u2018not a\nwitch.\u2019\nOverall spending on campaign advertising in this election cycle exceed\ned$3.3bn (\u00a32.1bn), an all-time record\nfor congressional elections. Most ads\nfocused on economic issues, but they\nwere also noted as being the most\nnegative in tone ever. Healthcare was\nanother big theme, given strong voter\nresentment in most states toward the\nObama administrations rapid expansion of government involvement in that\nsector. Other campaign themes ranged\nfrom \u2018red meats\u2019 issues like immigration to some of the most bizarre personal attacks in US electoral history,\nsuch as an ad that claimed Rand Paul,\nthe Republican candidate in Kentucky,\nworshiped idols and mocked Christians.\nUnsurprisingly, the ad backfired and Dr\nPaul won his race by double-digits.\nWhat do the results mean for US business and the world economy?\nWhilst Tuesday night was seen overall\nas a win for Republicans and fiscal conservatives in particular, questions are\nalready being raised about the extent\nof any impact on the real economy. The\nFederal Reserve in particular is widely\nexpected to counter any moves to bring\nAnglo-German style austerity to America. Not only is it already being taken\nas a given that interest rates will remain\nnear zero for the foreseeable future, but\nadditional rounds of quantitative easing are now seen as almost inevitable.\nAs Felix goes to press, Ben Bernanke\nis expected to announce $500 billion in\nadditional \u2018stimulus\u2019 whilst markets are\nthought to be pricing in around $1 trillion over the next few months.\nIn terms of specific policies, it is unlikely that already-enacted bills such\nas healthcare will be repealed, but the\nRepublican takeover of the House will\nprobably stop new legislation. With the\nexception of immigration reform that\nmany business leaders have been championing for the past year, this is likely\nto raise investor confidence in the US\neconomy. A much feared expansion of\n\u2018cap-and-trade\u2019 will now almost certainly not happen whilst some of the most\ncontentious parts of the financial regulation bill likely be retracted. Robert Doll,\nchief equity strategist at the world\u2019s\nlargest fund manager BlackRock recons\nthat \u201cthe near-term issue of [most] importance to investors is the Bush-era tax\ncuts.\u201d These are due to expire soon but\nwill probably now be extended by the\nRepublican-controlled House.\nDespite record low figures on home\nprices and unemployment, the S&P\n500 rose thirteen per cent in the last\ncouple of months. This was likely to\nhave been the pricing-in of Republican\ngains in the Midterms, which means\nthat equity markets will probably not\nbe significantly moved by election re-sults. In fact, the S&P 500 opened on\nWednesday morning almost unmoved\nfrom Tuesday.\nIt may be a different story in the coming weeks for the US Dollar however,\nas the Fed and the ECB are seen to be\npursuing very divergent policies. Whilst\nthe Federal Reserve may pursue inflationary policies to counter likely cuts\nin the rate of increase of government\nspending, the ECB has signalled that\nit is already looking to tighten its monetary policy. According to Bloomberg,\nanalyst consensus is now saying that the\nEuro will appreciate beyond resistance\nlevels between $1.45 and $1.50 before\nthe New Year. Much will depend on\nthe Republicans\u2019 ability to reign in the\nFed, which judging from their failure\nto Audit the central bank despite having the support of over two-thirds of the\nHouse earlier this year, including over\none hundred Democrats, appears to be\nnon-existent.\n2010 has been a highly emotional election cycle, will large scale rallies held regularly throughout the year\n5tat1stics Corn3r\nFriday 05 November 2010\n\n"

    "content": "17\nfelix FRIDAY 5 november 2010\nF\nor those of you who did\nnot read Alexander Khanin\u2019s comment piece from\nthe 22/10/10 issue of Felix,\nhis thesis can be reduced to\na number of playground-worthy state-ments. I have a big problem with his\nreasoning and the nature of his claims\nso let us work our way through them. It\nwill not take long I promise, but for the\nsake of intelligent debate everywhere he\nneeds to be cut down to size.\nFirst, that Professor Dawkins is a callous profiteer. The author, maybe trying\nto be \u201cdown with the youth\u201d, compared\nhim to Christina Aguilera and implied\nthat he is pocketing all the proceeds\nfrom merchandise sales on his web-site. If you dislike someone as much as\nMr Khanin appears to, you should find\nevidence to support your claims. Merchandise sales from richarddawkins.net\ndirectly benefit his foundation for reason and science. To see for yourself (yes\nthat is evidence) go to http://store.rich-arddawkins.net/. Dawkins, rather than\nbeing a profiteer, is savvy in providing\nmonetary support (a drop in the ocean\ncompared to organised religions\u2019 riches)\nElliott Hind\nfor his foundation at a time when religious superstition goes largely unchallenged in spite of the misery it causes.\nMoving swiftly on to the second\nclaim, anybody who has ever heard of\nDawkins is, I am sure, perfectly aware\nof his opinions. He would not be a very\neffective proponent of a secular society\nif he didn\u2019t state his case as frequently\nand eloquently as he does. Does the\nPope stop talking about his church\u2019s\nstance on contraception and condom\nuse in Africa? No. Do extremist Muslim preachers keep their views about the\nwest and women\u2019s rights private? No.\nBizarrely, Khanin\u2019s irrational dislike of\nDawkins appears to compel him to write\nmore than the despicable worldviews of\nsome leaders of major faiths.\nRichard Dawkins is a national treas-ure. He is passionate about encouraging children to question their elders\nand think for themselves. He actively\nencourages a full scale assault on solving nature\u2019s mysteries and it is clear that\nhe cares deeply about humanity and our\nfuture. We could all be a bit more like\nDawkins. Yes, that includes you Mr\nKhanin.\n\u201cDawkins, rather than\nbeing a profiteer, is\nsavvy in providing\nmonetary support for\nhis foundation\u201d\nThe Dawkins delusion Dear Felix,\nThe article titled \u201cPG mingle delights\nUnion\u201d read \u201cGSA have done much\nbetter job of organizing events such\nas pub quizzes than in the previous\nyears\u201d. This statement is slightly\nincorrect. The Pub Quiz organized\nonce per month remains similar in\nformat to the one organized in previous years. However, I appreciate\nFelix for noticing that the GSA improved its provision of events since\nJuly 2010 after an Events Team dedicated towards this goal was formed\nin April of the same year.\nTo fill in a little history, before the\nGSA Events Team started planning\nevents, it took the pulse of the PG\npopulation at Imperial, by conducting an online survey. The survey,\ntaken by around 200 Postgrads was\nan eye-opener, in which 65% of respondents said that they wanted\nmore events and were generally unhappy with the social scene at Imperial. Subsequent personal meeting\nwith 15 PG\u2019s further strengthened\nour belief that the GSA should provide Postgrads a time and place\nto mingle with those outside their\ndepartments.\nSince the team took-over, there\nwere a string of three successful social events. The first event was the\nMovie Night, which turned out to be\na smashing hit with around 90 attendees who paid \u00a32 to watch \u201cThe\nHurt Locker\u201d. The second event,\nGSA Pub-Night, was another big\nsuccess and saw the participation\nof around 45 students. The third\nevent, a Knitting and Salsa mixer,\nwas organized in association with\nPostgraduate Society Goldsmiths\nUniversity of London and Imperial\nCollege\u2019s Knit Society.\nThe 2009/10 Events Team strived\nhard to improve the social scene\nfor the PGs and thus have set the\ngroundwork for this year\u2019s students\nto enjoy a vibrant community. If the\nPostgrad Mingle, with about 1000\nattendees, was anything to go by,\nthen all signs point to a fun year.\nWith regards,\nShivendra\nEvents Director \u2013 2009/10,\nGSA\nLetter to the Editor\nCOMMENT\nThe opinions expressed on the Comment pages represent the views of the author only.\nBonfire Weekend Fireworks\n7.

    "content": "15\nfelix FRIDAY 5 novemBER 2010\nCOMMENT\nWe\u2019re all f***ed. So what?\nL\nast week\u2019s Black Sheep\ncertainly got the column\nstarted with a bang. At least\nI thought it had, for the first\nhundred words. Then I realised the noise was coming from me\nsmashing my head through the paper\nonto the desk underneath it.\nThe column, headed with the whorish\ngrandmother of all rhetorical questions,\n\u2018Is infidelity such a crime?\u2019, was initially on pretty sane territory. Does John\nTerry\u2019s personal life have any bearing\non his skills as a footballer? No. He just\nhappens to be shit at both. Does Jennifer Aniston\u2019s love life have any impact on my day to day living? Not since\nI stopped stalking her in the late nine-ties. But then the article hits engineering works at Sanity Junction and diverts\nitself straight on to Crazy Towne. The\nproblem is this - infidelity is a weakness\nof character.\nThat some members of Imperial are\ndirely in need of a Filofax to organise\ntheir romantic engagements doesn\u2019t\nmean that it\u2019s an understandable human\ncondition. We\u2019re such a fickle bunch of\nwangs in this day and age. If we can\u2019t\nAngry Geek\nrepress knowledge of our own faults\nthen the next best thing is to make it ac-ceptable. Smoking. Drink. Donations to\n\u2018Save The Dolphin\u2019 charities. Why is it\nthat when we do stupid things our instinct is to pretend it\u2019s normal?\nIt wouldn\u2019t be so bad if the Black\nSheep had maintained the moral high\nground for the duration, but by the end\nthey\u2019re pouring scorn on Wayne Rooney for \u2018repeatedly\u2019 lying to someone.\nWhat? Really? John Terry slept with his\nfriend\u2019s ex-girlfriend behind his wife\u2019s\nback. We\u2019re not in the business of drawing straight lines on a graph here, you\nonly need one data point - the guy\u2019s a\ntosser.\nHumans are flawed. I\u2019m currently eating pear drops in quantities that will give\nme glaucoma by the time I\u2019m thirty. Is\nthat acceptable? No it\u2019s fucking not. Are\nthey uniformly delicious and am I stuffing three into my mouth as I write this?\nYou damn well bet I am. Will my girlfriend try to hide them when she reads\nthis article? Yes indeed. Will it be too\nlate by that point? Most likely.\nOrgasm-inducing boiled sweets aside,\nlet\u2019s reiterate that \u2018humans-are-flawed\u2019\npoint. If you\u2019re disloyal, cheat, pay\nwomen to do things to you that no sane\nperson would do in a full biohazard suit,\nthen you are less of a human being. If\nyou resist the temptation to stuff any\nand all rhubarb and custards you see into\nyour mouth, then you are more of a human being than I.\nNo-one should lose their job over it,\nthat\u2019s plain to see, but should they lose\nthe respect of their friends, family and\nsociety as a whole? Yes they should. But\neven if this doesn\u2019t happen, even if you\ncan\u2019t be bothered to summon up any\ncontempt for them, what you absolutely\nmust not do is try to justify it. \u201cWell, we\nall do it, don\u2019t we?\u201d is the anthem of the\nslowly decaying chain-smoker, the casual racist, and the serial adulterer.\nSo just slap yourself in the face now,\nreader. Go on. Because you\u2019re a horrible\nperson and you probably deserve it.\nHave you been reading other columnists behind my back? Tell me\nthey meant nothing to you at\nanangrygeek@googlemail.com.\nYou two-timing shit.\nT\nhey say that when a man\nis bored of London, he is\nbored of life. If this is true,\nI should take a running leap\noff Hammersmith Bridge in\nmy solid concrete Hushpuppies \u2013 how-ever, no matter how boring life may\nget, I\u2019m certain that the alternative is\neven more so. To clarify, of course I\u2019m\nnot bored of London, merely bored in\nLondon.\nAll the usual pleas to rouse fall on deaf\nears. It\u2019s a lovely day outside \u2013 no, it\u2019s\ntypical British autumn, grey and wet.\nLondon is filled with museums and galleries \u2013 yes, and my soul is obese from\na glut of culture. It\u2019s going on a crash-diet of The Jeremy Kyle Show starting\ntomorrow. You could always do some\nwork \u2013 no, I\u2019m looking for something to\navoid boredom.\nI\u2019m sure this sounds familiar to many\nof you. For all the great wonders and\nsights of the capital, for all the complex\ngalaxies of social interaction available,\nit can be painfully easy to sail into the\ndoldrums of interminable boredom. It\u2019s\nnot like I haven\u2019t tried; I\u2019ve already exhausted several avenues of novelty but\nnothing quite scratched the itch of my\nennui.\nAt first I tried cleaning, that perennial favourite. Everything went back in\nRhys Davies\nits proper place and the newly-vacated\nsurfaces were polished to a shine. I\nwent round and round my house with\nthe vacuum cleaner, on all the floors.\nOnce, then twice and then I hoovered\nthe walls, just to make sure. The bathroom was next, the toilet bleached,\nthe bath de-limescaled and the tiles\nscrubbed of mildew. I even removed the\nU-bend from under the sink and began\nharrying it with a toothbrush. Althought\nperhaps I should have let the bleach\npass through first. All I know is, after\nseeing some phantasmagorical colours\nin a faraway land, I awoke to the exact\nsame apathy.\nI then grew more adventurous. With\nsome stale cheese, I was able to tempt\na few opportunistic mice into my com-pany. Initially, they were too skittish to\nlearn any tricks. I thought I\u2019d help them\nloosen up by dosing them with marijuana (That I just happened to stumble\nupon: honestly, I thought it was pot-pourri!). Unfortunately, the only stunts\nthat they could perform were giggling\nuncontrollably and asking if I had any\nMars bars. While this was somewhat\namusing for a little while, I stopped\nlaughing long before the mice did.\nAdventurousness gave way to criminal insanity. Climbing to the top of the\ntallest buildings I could find, I took it\nupon myself to throw a series of cakes,\ntarts and desserts into the metropolis\nbelow. The result was like watching\na firework display of flour, sugar and\ncream, with the same inherent joy. My\nsoul leapt to see a zesty lemon cheesecake explode across the pavement and\nI felt a lightness in my spirit as pedestrians fled screaming from the sudden\ndownpour of Black Forest gateaux.\nThe catastrophic, instantaneous beauty\nseemed to resonate with my sense of\nthe fleeting futility of human endeav-our... also, it was damned good fun to\nwatch the custards go splat!\nAs my spirits began to lift, I realised\nthe macrocosm of my experience. Humanity gets bored very easily and seeks\nconstantly to alleviate it through the\npursuit of the novel. We are all trying to\nease that eternal itch of the soul. Each\nmay have his preferred avenue; it just\ntakes some experimenting to find the\nperfect salve.\nMy own experiences on this dreary\nafternoon have led me to coin a stupendous new proverb, or tweak an old\none (Apologies, Dr. Johnson): \u201cWhen\na man is bored with inhaling bleach,\ndealing illicit drugs to rodents and delighting in the combination of cake and\ngravity, he is well and truly bored with\nlife.\u201d\nChairman of the bored\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d help\nthe mice loosen up\nby dosing them with\nmarijuana... (that\nI just happened to\nstumble upon)\u201d\n\u201cDoes John Terry\u2019s\npersonal life have\nany bearing on his\nskills as a footballer?\nNo. He just happens\nto be shit at both\u201d\nOnline reactions to\nlast week\u2019s\nBlack Sheep\nfelixonline.co.uk\n\u201cWell said. It\u2019s ridiculous that\npeople should lose their jobs\nover infidelity. Not being able to\nkeep it in your pants is hardly\na sign that you\u2019re incapable\nof dribbling a ball, or trending the corridors of power or\nanything else for that matter. It\njust shows you\u2019re unhappy with\nyour relationship and it either\nneeds ending or at least a bit\nof work.\u201d\nNia John\n\u201cInfidelity. A hugely dramatised\nword. Some people say \u201cwhen\nit happens to me I will...\u201d And\nsome would say \u201c If you feel\nyour relationship getting stale,\neither work on it, or end it.\u201d But\ndon\u2019t forget life isn\u2019t a simple\nequation. There is not a single rule to decide what\u2019s right.\nInfidelity is so dramatised on\nTV and books nowadays, that\npeople in it can\u2019t think straight\nanymore. Onlookers may judge,\nthey may give advice. But deep\ndown only the two person\nwho\u2019s involved in it know what\u2019s\nbest for them. What matters is\nwhether you have come out of\nthe tunnel a better person.\u201d\nKa Wai Wong\nNext week... performance\nenhancing drugs should be\nallowed in sport.\nLetter to the Editor\nDear Editor,\nDuring my time at Imperial I\u2019ve\nnoticed that every few weeks\nthere is an event where conflict\nbetween science and religion is\ndiscussed.\nI notice that the proportion\nof people who express doubt\nin God is much higher in countries where most people have\nbeen educated. The proportion rises further with the \u2018top\u2019\nscientists. Since the scientific\nrevolution, religious belief fallen every century.\nIt\u2019s clear to me that faith\ngroups have much to fear from\nthe march of progress, science\nand education.\nRegards\nJakov Marelic\nThe opinions expressed on the Comment pages represent the views of the author only.\n\n"

I told them that\nI wanted to do research and if they gave\nme a first I would go to Cambridge, if\nthey gave me a second I would stay at\nOxford. They gave me a first\u201d.\nThe audience enjoyed his sense of hu-mour, not only in his words but also in\nthe pictures shown behind him of physics theorems presented in a comic way.\nThe professor explained that he was\nalways fascinated by science and how\nthings work, but he concentrated on\nphysics because he believed that it was\nthe most fundamental of the sciences.\nHe confessed: \u201cmy father told me to\nstudy medicine, but I didn\u2019t like biology.\u201d\nHe discussed the people that inspired\nhim in his research such as Sciama Dennis, Richard Feynman, Roger Penrose,\nand Werner Israel, and about some of\nthe topics he is interested in like Black\nHoles, formation of Galaxies and Universe Expansion. He gave some basic\ninformation for each topic to give food\nfor thought.\nHe gave a brief reference to his numerous publications including \u201cA Brief\nHistory of Time\u201d, \u201cBlack Holes and\nBaby Universes and Other Essays\u201d and\n\u201cThe Universe in a Nutshell\u201d. He emphasized his new book, \u201cThe Grand Design\u201d, which was written with Leonard\nMlodinow.\nAt the end of the lecture, an exclusive edition of \u201cThe Grand Design\u201d was\ngiven free to all the attendants together\nwith \u201cEureka\u201d, the monthly science\nmagazine from The Times.\nDuring his book presentation he said\nthat \u201cto understand the Universe better\nwe have to understand why we exist.\nThe Universe was created by nothing,\nnot by supernatural creatures or Gods\u201d.\nHe explained the purpose of his new\nbook; which is to answer some fundamental questions of life such as \u201cWhy\nare we here?\u201d or \u201cWhere do we come\nfrom?\u201d\nAt the end of the lecture, Stephen\nHawking was asked the question \u201cdo\nyou think it will come the time that\npeople will learn everything about physics?\u201d. He gave a quick and interesting\nanswer making space for new questions\nin our minds; \u201cI hope not!\u201d\nWhile watching this wheelchair-bound man in the centre of the stage giving an incredible lecture, with thousands\nof people showing their respect for him,\nI realized that whatever difficulties may\narise in our lives, we should never give\nup, and we must keep trying no matter\nhow hard our goal seems.\nSo for me, and I believe for many of\nthose at the lecture, the evening was a\nvery important lesson. Not only in astronomy and cosmology, but also a lesson for life.\nAnastasia Eleftheriou\n2009 swine flu carried deadly mutation\nResearchers at Imperial have been part\nof a global team whose latest research is\ngiving greater insight into what caused\ntens of thousands of fatalities during last\nyear\u2019s H1N1 pandemic.\nViruses are weirdly beautiful. Their\nDNA material is held in a delicate and\nunique protein casing; an arrangement\nunlike any living structure. However, it\nis this casing which Imperial researcher,\nProfessor Ten Feizi, and her team believes may hold the key to understanding what makes a particle invisible to the\nnaked eye into a killer.\nThe protein casing allows the virus to\nstick to receptors on the surface of human cells. It\u2019s like puzzle pieces; where\nthe protein casing and the receptor\nmatch in shape, the virus latches on and\ninfects the cell.\nLast December the World Health Organisation (WHO) published a report\nlooking at a mutation where one of the\nbuilding blocks of a protein in the casing shell had been altered. Professor Ten\nFeizi and collaborating teams have been\nconducting extensive research which\nhas shown that this change results in\nmarked differences in the way that the\nvirus affects our bodies. The researchers reconstructed the receptors lining the\nairways on glass surfaces. By examining how viruses stuck to these receptors,\nthey were able to demonstrate that the\nmutated virus was able to attach itself\nwith greater strength to more cells in the\nairways than seen with other flu viruses.\nUsually, in seasonal flu, the virus only\ninfects a limited number of cells in our\nLizzie Crouch\nnose and throat resulting in familiar yet\nuncomfortable symptoms. The mutated\nswine flu virus is not only more infectious but also prevents the tiny in-built\ncleaners from clearing away any further\ngrime which can accumulate, opening\nFilthy swines: the 2009 swine flu outbreak, originating in Mexico, has killed more than 18,000 people worldwide\nup the possibility of more severe symptoms and even pneumonia.\nThe mutated H1N1 virus, known as\nD222G, was found randomly as the pandemic spread across the world. It wasn\u2019t\nthe generation of a new subset of virus.\nIt was sporadic and sometimes deadly\nmutation. However, despite this latest\nresearch going further to explain the\nreason behind the fatalities seen during\nthe pandemic, it is important to note that\nonly 7.1% of people who died from the\nswine flu during the pandemic suffered\nfrom the mutated form. In fact, in December 2009 the WHO released a statement that said \u201cthe D222G substitution\ndoes not appear to pose a major public\nhealth issue.\u201d\nThe fact still remains however that\npeople infected with this mutant variant of the H1N1 virus are more likely\nto have severe and fatal illness. Professor Feizi warns that \u201cIf the mutant virus were to acquire the ability to spread\nmore widely, the consequences could be\nvery serious... The virus is constantly\nevolving, and it\u2019s possible that a new\nform as dangerous as the 1918 pandemic\ncould emerge.\u201d\n5tat1stics Corn3r\n1 1 6 ,5 6 9\n15,372\n38,679,799\n5,629,776\n1,512,754\n789,099,355\n3,523,597\nSpecies gone extinct this year so far.\nDays of oil left at current useage.\nAbortions this year so far.\nDeaths caused by smoking this year so\nfar.\nDeaths caused by drinking this year so\nfar.\nKilometres the Earth has traveled in\nspace in our Solar System this year so far.\nBillion litres of water consumed this\nyear so far.\nFriday 05 November 2010\n\n"

This is\nthe conclusion of a survey by the Higher Education\nCareers Services Unit (HECSU) of 225,000 graduates questioned in January this year, after leaving\nuniversity in the summer of 2008.\nEmployment prospects have not looked so grim\nsince 1993, when the UK was coming out of a recession and graduate unemployment peaked at 11.6%.\n\u201cThese latest figures show that students are graduating from university into the bleakest employment\nmarket for decades\u201d, said Aaron Porter, president of\nthe National Union of Students.\nWhilst the number of Imperial graduates unemployed does not hit national averages, the university\nis not immune either. Imperial\u2019s graduate unemployment has risen sharply from 5% to 7.6% over the\npast year, closing the gap between Imperial and the\nnational average. Imperial graduates entering employment within six months was down from 69.9% to\n60.2%, although this can be partly accounted for by\nmore students entering into further study.\nThe survey also revealed that the proportion of\ngraduates working in non-graduate sectors such as\nretail and catering rose to about one in seven.\nStriking differences between different degree subjects are also highlighted. IT graduates fared worst,\nwith a staggering 16.3% still seeking work after six\nmonths. Also in the top five for the highest unemployment were media studies, design, accountancy\nand electrical and electronic engineering. Only 6.2%\nof law graduates were out of work after this period.\nHowever, graduate unemployment is still some way\noff the levels seen in the last recession. Charlie Ball,\nDeputy Director of Research from HECSU, believes\nthat \u201cprospects for graduates in the short-term look\nbright and next year we expect to see a decline.\u201d\nBall also stresses that young people thinking\nabout university should not be deterred by the latest\nfigures. Average starting salaries are still substantially higher for graduates (\u00a319,695) than for non-graduates (\u00a315,912).\nThe study is compiled from a national survey carried out by all UK university careers services each\nyear and then collected together and analysed by\nHECSU. However, the reliability of the results has\nbeen questioned by Imperial\u2019s own careers service.\n\u201cEach graduate is asked about their activity on one\nspecific date in the January following the end of their\ncourse. If he or she is starting a job the following\nweek, they would still be classed as unemployed for\nthe purposes of the survey,\u201d said Elspeth Farrar, director of Imperial College Careers Advisory Service.\nAlex Dahinten, Deputy President (Education) of\nImperial College Union, emphasised the benefits of\nparticipating or taking an active role in the union\u2019s\nclubs and societies to improve their employment\nprospects: \u201cYou have the opportunity to learn a number of vital soft skills which are not taught in lecture theatres, while having fun and getting to meet\nlike-minded people. Graduates should not underestimate the ability to give a presentation, work in a\ngroup or chair a meeting.\u201d\nThe deputy president believes that companies will\ncontinue to fight over employing Imperial graduates.\n\u201cWe come from a world-class university and due\nto the subject choice and academic responsibilities\nthat we carry during our time here, we will always be\n\u2018in-demand\u2019 graduates.\u201d Sophia David\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\njobs, thousands of people within the\nUK could potentially fill the role, in\nresearch, that number is down to tens\nof people across the globe. This means\nthat the immigration cap on non UK/\nEU immigrants introduced by the Home\nSecretary, Theresa May, in June could\npotentially have serious negative consequences on the competitiveness of the\nresearch done within UK universities.\nResearchers who are resident outside\nand wish to work in the UK have to obtain a visa, of which there are two main\ntypes which apply to research staff, tier\none and tier two.\nTier one is a personal visa, where applicants have to apply through a system,\ngiving information on their age, degree\nlevel, earnings, et cetera. This information is then assessed and given a score\nin several categories. Each category has\na different \u2018pass mark\u2019 and applicants\nmust pass each category in order to\nqualify for the visa. The length of this\nvisa is usually a fixed term, typically\naround two years. There is, however, a\nhard cap of 600 of these visas which can\nbe issued per month; which in October\nwas already \u2018used up\u2019 by the 20th. On\ntop of that, tier one visas are hard to ob-tain, with the ratio of tier one to tier two\nvisas at 1:1 in the Physics department\ndespite the department strongly advising researchers to obtain a tier one visa\nwherever possible.\nThe second type of visa is the tier two\nvisa, which can only be applied for if the\nindividual has a sponsorship certificate,\nwhich is issued by the university. These\nvisas last only until the end of a contract\nwith an individual, and individuals looking to extend or renew contracts, must\nalso obtain a new tier two visa. There is\na limit on tier two visas, with Imperial\u2019s\nquota across the whole university being\n82 certificates which can be issued between June 2010 and March 2011. It is\nworth noting that researchers who need\nto renew their tier two visas also count\ntoward the quota and contracts which\nhave ended do not \u2018add\u2019 back to the\nnumber of certificates that can be issued.\nHaving already used up around half\nthe tier two sponsorship certificates\nwhich they are allowed to issue for\nthis year, there is a real concern that\nnearer January, research groups will\nbe forced to turn away some excellent\ncandidates simply because they cannot\nobtain a visa. In particular, postdoctoral\nresearchers on tier two visas looking to\nextend their visa after the quota has been\nfilled, face the real risk of deportation\nback to their home countries though it is\nhoped that the extra time in the UK will\nentitle them to successfully apply for the\ndifferent visas.\nImperial has a particularly diverse\nworkforce. In the physics department\nalone, around 25% of post doctoral researchers were hired from outside the\nEU from 2006-2010, highlighting the\nimportance that high quality immigrants\nfrom outside of the EU has for research.\nAdrian Sutton, head of the condensed\nmatter theory group in the Physics department at Imperial, expressed his concern by stating that \u201cUniversities have\nalways disregarded where people come\nfrom because they recognise that to be\nthe best you have to recruit the best\npeople. That is why there are so many\npostdoctoral researchers from outside\nthe EEA at the top UK universities.\nThey have been attracted by our open,\ninclusive culture in UK higher educa-tion. The UKBA restrictions are negating this culture, a culture which led to 3\nof the 4 Nobel prize winners in the UK\nthis year being awarded to immigrants.\u201d\nOverseas applicants already have significant disadvantages when applying to\njobs within the UK. Since the \u2018Resident\nlabour market test\u2019 was introduced, employers are forced to give precedence\nto any applicants who are from within\nthe EU, when applicants have the same\nskills and experience listed in job ad-verts.\nProfessor Simon Gaskell, principal\nof Queen Mary University of London,\nrecently stated in an interview with the\nBBC, that he believes \u201cThe most damaging thing that we could do to UK higher\neducation, UK research, UK science, is\nto reduce the attractiveness of this coun-try, for overseas scientists and other researchers.\u201d\nThe government is not oblivious to\nthese concerns. Science minister David\nWillets and Business Secretary Vince\nCable, acknowledged that there were\nproblems with the current system when\nspeaking at a \u201cscience question time\u201d at\nthe Royal Institute, on the 26th of October. However, ever since the immigration laws were introduced, it is hard not\nto notice that top athletes such as premiership footballers have been exempt\nfrom the restrictions, perhaps suggesting a lack of respect for the important\nrole that research plays for the UK as a\nwhole.\nWith increasing levels of bureaucracy\nand hoops to jump through, researchers\nfrom abroad will see the UK as a less appealing place to work. The real danger is\nnot a cut to funding anymore, but a cut\nto the level of talent which helps give the\nUK its reputation for world class education and research. And that, for many\npeople, is much, much worse.\nDeportation risk for\npostdoc researchers\nComment on this\narticle online at\nfelixonline.co.uk\n...Continued from Front Page\nFriday 05 November 2010\nAlthough all seems well at lunch in the Senior Common Room, postdoctoral researchers on\ntier two visas face the real risk of deportation\nPhoto by Kadhim Shubber\n\n"

Sometimes,\nhowever, food brings out more important issues - poverty, governmental corruption, Jamie\nOliver\u2019s rather unhygienic habits and, wait for\nthis, freedom of speech.\nYou may think I have completely lost my\nmind, what has food got to do with freedom of\nspeech, you ask? The truth is that food is an intimately subjective thing, descriptively flimsy\nand almost always perceived different by different people; think Marmite. Ask every Nigella wannabe and you\u2019ll find out that there are\nas many taste preferences as there are plastic\ncups outside Eastside Bar on Saturdays. Many,\nif you are unaware of the post-Friday carnage.\nExactly because food perception is varied and\npersonal, everyone should be given an opportunity to express his or her views objectively,\non whatever platform one is comfortable with.\nGiven how we are living in an age with constant bombardment from partially factual advertisements (apparently everything lowers\nrisk of heart diseases now) and near-impossible\nclaims, the voice of the common-man can be\nrather obscured. Peer reviews on printed me-dia, blogs, online review aggregators and social\nnetworking sites are extremely valuable sources of information before making decisions,\ndefinitely more trustworthy than a billboard ad.\nWhat happens, though, when a factual review\nof a restaurant lands you a lawsuit?\nWhat happened was, Shivya, the food-blog-ger behind \u2018The Shooting Star\u2019 had a rather\nunpleasant experience in a restaurant. Shivya\nwas having lunch at an Indian restaurant when\na waiting staff stumbled and spilled curry and\ncurds all over her back. Naturally, thanks to\nMurphy\u2019s blessing, Shivya had to be wearing\na black jacket. It is common knowledge that\nwhite fluids on black jacket is not exactly the\nprettiest thing on earth. Thus, Shivya spoke to\nthe head staff who appeared to have asked her\nto foot her bill, and when confronted about the\nspillage, the head staff argued that \u201cit happens\nsometimes with food\u201d. Great, first the jacket,\nand now, an unreasonable staff. The manager\nof the restaurant in question called Shivya a\nshort while later and explained that the waiter\nwas hurt. The manager also said that Shivya\nwould be compensated. Fair enough? Nay; the\ncompensation would come from the waiter\u2019s\nsalary.\nClearly, this story has much dramatic potential and might make an excellent short film, but\nthat aside, the restaurant had made a number\nof fundamentally annoying mistakes. First, Indian curry and curds should not be on anything\nbut cooking pans, serving bowls and in the gut,\ncustomers\u2019 jackets are no exceptions. Next, the\nrestaurant should have shown at least a respectful amount of concern for the customer after\nthe spilling. Also, docking the waiter\u2019s pay is\njust pure unkind. I\u2019m aware that there are other\nrestaurants with similar practices when the\nwaiting staff make mistakes, but it is just darn\nright mean.\nThe story doesn\u2019t end here. Shivya, our food\nblogger here, was naturally unhappy with the\nresponse from the restaurant\u2019s management\nand, consistent with the anger-dealing mechanism of most bloggers, decided to post her experience online. Shivya posted a rather angsty\nreview on a Singapore-based peer review aggregate site, Hungry Go Where, and about a\nmonth later, received an e-mail from the moderator asking for her details to verify her review\nas the restaurant had refuted her review. What\nfollowed was an e-mail from the restaurant to\nShivya requesting for her contact details so as\nto send her a legal notice. Apparently, the restaurant believed Shivya had written the review\nas a means to defame them.\nThere are little details on what exactly happened after, but however it develops, it is a\nhorrible sign of corporations bullying the everyday man. (Shivya did not want to make a\nstatement to Felix on the matter in light of the\nlegal proceedings she is currently involved\nin). Being sued for an article detailing factual\nevents is most unacceptable. Online citizen\nfood journalism is what keeps our wallets safe\nfrom the charming little lies that restaurants\noften use to lure in big bucks. Restaurants\nshould deal with complains admirably and\nnot attempt to silent the speaker. If restaurants\neliminate food bloggers by scaring them with\nlegal notices, where would we get our daily\ndoses of food porn? However, it must also be\nsaid that all bloggers, no matter what they lead\nyou to believe, are at least slightly narcissistic.\nWhether the blogger in question enjoyed her\nlittle curry-induced fame is beyond any con-jecture.\nMy advice? Get yourself a waterproof plastic poncho and bring it every time you dine\nat an Indian restaurant.

His\nrough brush stokes and strong lines lend\nthe peasants a rugged, stoic air and there\nis a stillness similar to that of his still lifes\nsuggesting the timelessness of the scene.\nThe mix of colours blended carefully to\nmake each block of colour are beautiful,\nalthough the compositions sometimes appear a little off balance.\nAlthough there are fewer than 20 works\nexhibited, they have been brought together from all over the world, including loans\nfrom the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay in Paris and the\nMet in New York (to where this exhibit\nmoves in the New Year). Three of his five\nlarge final canvases are displayed (the others cannot be loaned), along with many intricate studies of the individual farmers in\npencil, watercolour and oil - C\u00e9zanne produced far more preparatory work for this\nseries than he usually did as he considered\nhis subject very ambitious.\nThe idea is to enable the visitor to fully\nappreciate C\u00e9zanne\u2019s creative process over\nthe five years during which he produced\nthis series of paintings and I really enjoyed\ntrying to imagine how he worked. (This\nexhibition has allowed art historians to\nrevise their understanding of the order in\nwhich his various paintings were created).\nThere is a relatively in-depth guide to each\npainting giving insight into its subject and\nthe artistic techniques, which helps as it\nis necessary to appreciate each painting if\nyou don\u2019t want to leave feeling a little dissatisfied by the small number of works.\nThis is definitely worth a visit for anyone\ninterested in C\u00e9zanne and you will have\nplenty of time left to visit the rest of the\ngallery which includes several works by\nC\u00e9zanne\u2019s great influence, Pissarro.\nWHAT\u2019S\nNEW ABOUT\nCEZANNE?\nIt\u2019s more than 100\nyears since C\u00e9zanne,\none of the great French\npost-impressionist\npainters died, so how\nmuch more is there to\nsay?

James Bond will\nsurreptitiously tell you what time it is\nas he tracks some unknown person\u2019s\nmovements; at four o\u2019clock bands of\nexcited children run out of classrooms\nscreaming as their teacher tells them to\nslow down; and I am almost sure I saw\nKevin Spacey walk across the screen\nwith a watch on his hand in a scene from\nThe Usual Suspects.\nThe logistics of the project are un-imaginable. A moment in movie history was found for every minute of the\nday. Most minutes even have multiple\nclocks and ways of telling the time\nfrom various different films. Moreover,\neach scene is faultlessly edited so that it\nruns into the next with no interruptions.\nSomehow, Marclay has even managed\nto make music spill from its original\nscene into the next, flowing constantly\nin one direction.\nThere is no plot. How could there be?\nRealistically speaking it would be impossible for a plot to materialize. Nevertheless, you believe in a plot. Or in\nmany interweaving plots that twist and\nturn as the minute passes. Everything\nseems to build up to the hour, where in a\nsudden blast of clocks and actors shouting out the time as they run to their next\nengagements, time appears to end. Then\nthe clock starts ticking again.\n\u2018The Clock\u2019 functions as just that;\na clock. If you were to play it on your\nkitchen television, you would only have\nto look or perhaps listen for a few seconds to tell the time. But \u2018The Clock\u2019 is\nmuch more than just a movie that tells\nthe time. It is a visual representation of\nthe infiniteness of time, a compilation\nof recognizable moments from the 20th\nand 21st centuries and a commentary on\nthe randomness of instants in life.\nThat is what it meant to me.

    "content": "FELIX 5\nINTERVIEW\nCharles Betts\ninterviews\nMark Field MP\nI\nn September, during\na speech at Queen\nMary University,\nVince Cable said\n\u201cthere is no justification for taxpayers\u2019\nmoney to be used to\nsupport research that\nis neither theoretically outstanding nor\ncommercially useful.\u201d\nWhat is your stance?\nMy concern is that with so much of\nscientific research it is difficult to gauge\nduring the early stages whether the work\nwill be useful. The very nature of scientific research often involves numerous\ncul-de-sacs before finally utilising some\nof the experience gleaned from going\ndown those various routes. I don\u2019t think\nhaving as hard and fast a rule in place is\nterribly sensible and I\u2019m afraid it doesn\u2019t\nreflect the reality of how scientific research is undertaken.\nThe science budget has been frozen\nfor the next 4 years, which represents\na 10% reduction in real terms. Do you\nagree with this?\nThere is a broader issue with funding\nat the moment. Because of the difficulties with the deficit funding, other budgets have taken absolute as well as real\ncuts. A freeze is rather more generous\nthan it is for other departments going\nforward. The difficulty with scientific\nresearch is that given those financial\nconstraints there is going to be an increasing demand for evidence of success\nover a much shorter time period. Scientific researchers may end up spending a\ndisproportionate amount of their time\non bureaucratic tasks such as filling in\nforms to get their next grant instead of\non scientific work.\nThe UK represents 1% of the world\npopulation, yet produces 8% of all\nscientific publications. Do you feel we\nmight lose this edge over the coming\nyears following the spending review?\nThe issue is that when you simply look\nat the raw statistics \u2013 if you start looking\nfor any measure of success, for example\nthe number of column inches in scientific magazines \u2013 then you get perverse incentives to do things in a particular way.\nA lot of what is published is only read by\na handful of people and just gathers dust\nin the library. That\u2019s not in any way to\nbelittle scientific research and we should\nbe proud of our track record, which we\nshould be looking to maintain, but one\nof the difficulties with highlighting quite\na narrow statistic is that some perverse\nincentives could come into play.\nDo you feel you can fully appreciate\nthe nature of scientific research if you\ndon\u2019t have a scientific background?\nI\u2019m sure there are many scientists at\nImperial who know more about politics\nthan I do about science. Obviously, you\nhave a limitation. What I\u2019d like to think\nI can provide is some perspective and to\nbe able to broaden the judgement on a\nrange of other issues, other than just the\nraw scientific research element. Clearly\nit helps to have a proper scientific back-ground. Equally, we are working within\nquite strict financial constraints and will\nbe for the rest of this decade and those\nconcerns also have to be addressed.\nYou don\u2019t feel it is a problem in terms\nof representing Imperial College as\nour local MP?\nThe trouble is my constituency is a\nuniquely diverse seat in many ways. It\nhas very wealthy areas and very poor ar-eas, and it is home to the scientific, the\nartistic, the political and the economic\ncentres of this country. I do my level\nbest to try and have an understanding\nof it all. But yes, it\u2019s a classic case of\nbeing a jack-of-all-trades and a master\nof none. I try and do a reasonable job in\nthat regard.\nThe Browne Review has suggested\nunlimited fees should be allowed. The\nUniversities Minister David Willetts\nhas said that \u201c unlimited fees are neither sustainable nor sensible.\u201d Vince\nCable has said, \u201cunlimited fees is an\navenue that is unlikely to be pursued.\u201d\nDo you think there should be a cap?\nI regret the stance that is being taken\nby Vince Cable and David Willetts. I can\nunderstand the politics of the situation,\ngiven that every one of the 57 Liberal\nDemocrats MPs were committed to no\nrise in fees, as to why we have ended up\nin this state. I would like to see the cap\nentirely removed. I see our universities\nas being elite international players and\nthe worry is that, even towards the best\nuniversities, there is a level of complacency in respect to their global role.\nThe funding of US universities means\nthat they can attract the best academics\nto make their careers there. I would like\nto see the cap lifted totally, allow the\nmarket to determine where fees are, have\nsome safeguards to ensure there are bur-saries in place and in the meantime try\nand build up alumni funds as in the US\nmodel. The worst of all worlds is if we\ndo have a cap and I am particularly worried about having a lower rate cap which\nis being suggested at \u00a36000-\u00a39000 \u2013 I\nwant to see a diversity of innovative\nuniversities. Let\u2019s have 2-year degrees\n(not at places like Imperial, but other\nplaces like private colleges) that cost\nsay \u00a33500/year. Give another option to\npeople rather than have the whole thing\nhamstrung in a very bureaucratic way. If\na cap is too low, one or two universities\nmay go private \u2013 you hear about Cambridge and Imperial contemplating that\nroute depending on how negotiations\npan out. I support the Browne review.\nI have had conversations with Richard\nSykes in the past and he would note how\nmuch you can charge a home grown student and how much you can charge an\ninternational student. He rightly takes\nthe view that we want our indigenous\nBritish people in our top institutions.\nGiven the enormous gulf between the\ntwo fee levels, there is going to be a\npush to get lots of overseas students. I\nwant to promote a genuine meritocracy.\nDo you envisage a system similar to\nthe American one?\n`Realistically I think we are heading\nin that sort of direction. The benefit the\nAmerican system has is that the private\nuniversities have these huge endowment\nfunds and are able to say if you are good\nenough \u2013 not necessarily academically,\nfor instance if you are an elite sportsman\n\u2013 if you can bring something to this institution then, whether your parents earn\na modest amount or not, we can make\na way of making that work. That\u2019s the\nsort of model we should aim towards. I\nappreciate that the American institutions\nhave the benefit of huge alumni funding\n\u2013 to get to that stage will take some time.\nIn the event of unlimited fees, the\nwealthiest could pay without prob-lem, and the poorest would be offered\nscholarships. Is there a chance the\nmiddle classes could suffer?\nYes, I think so. It\u2019s a classic debate\nwe\u2019ve been having in the last week\nabout housing benefits. It\u2019s the middle\nthat is being squeezed. I was the first\nperson in my family to go to university.\nI\u2019m from the middle class. I was very\nlucky and had a full grant and no debt.\nI am adverse to debt and can see that is\nthe worry \u2013 though I\u2019d probably take it\non the chin.\nWE SHOULD BE WORKING TOWARDS\nTHE AMERICAN SYSTEM\n\u201cI would like to see\nthe cap lifted totally;\nallow the market to\ndetermine fees\u201d\nFriday 05 November 2010\nPhoto by Slobodan Radosavljevic\n\n"

    "content": "POLITICS\nFELIX\n12\nPol\ni\nti\ncs Edi\ntors: Hassan Joudi, Rory Fenton\nJames Lees, Rajat Jain\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPeace in Korea\nIt is clear that North Korea is in a dire state in\nhumanitarian and political terms. On the 60th\nanniversary of the start of the Korean War and\n10th anniversary of opening diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom, from the outside it seems things have only gotten worse and\nthis trend can only continue.\nThis is a country which the fourth largest\nstanding army in the world, but this is only\npossible with a minimum height requirement\nof only 4\u20193\u201d due to years of malnourishment\nresulting in widespread stunted growth. It is\nalso a country which has technically been at\nwar with its southern neighbour, now fifteen\ntimes wealthier than the North, for 60 years.\nDespite the armistice, they continue to antago-nise their former countrymen by developing\nnuclear weapons, destroying their battleships\nand firing across the border.\nDuring last week\u2019s visit Lord Alton, Chair\nof the All-Party Parliamentary Committee on\nNorth Korea, questioned officials over internal human rights abuses. They confirmed that\nthe idea of \u2018innocent until proven guilty\u2019 is\nnot used and \u2018suspects\u2019 are not allowed any\ndefence until the trial stage has begun, when\nthey are already considered guilty. The death\npenalty, as of 2007, has been extended from\n5 to 21 offences including distribution of\nforeign audio-visual materials and economic\ncrimes.\nDespite official denials, it is clear that these\noffences are given a broad definition. While\npublic executions in the first half of this year\nare thought to stand at a relatively low (com-pared to the United States or China at least) 22,\nthere is no figure of death in prison camps as a\nresult of poor conditions, torture or execution.\nEarlier this year Shin Dong-Hyok, who was\nborn in prison camp No. 14, testified before\nthe European Parliament. He described being\nroasted on an open fire and seeing his family\nmembers executed. When questioned by David Alton about his testimony, officials denied\nthese prison camps even existed.\nLord Alton, did, however, report on some\npositive changes being seen. The first independent university, The Pyongyang University of\nScience and Technology, has finally been built\n(see below). Churches are also being opened;\nThe Korean Christian Federation has claimed\nthere are now 500 churches in North Korea,\nthough this is difficult to prove. Lord Alton\nand Baroness Cox visited a Russian Orthodox,\na Catholic and a Protestant church as well as\na seminary. While these indicate an increase\nin religious freedom, it should be noted that\nthe Russian Orthodox Church, despite having\nKorean priests, had mainly Russian diplomats\nworshipping. The Catholic Church is not even\nallowed to have a priest.\nThese physical changes have been dwarfed\nby the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea\u2019s first conference since 1966, where Kim Jong-Un, the third\nson of Kim Jong-il, was promoted to the rank\nof four-star General and Vice-Chairman of the\nCentral Military Commission. He is expected\nto succeed his father as the supreme leader,\ncontinuing the family\u2019s rule for a third genera-tion. Senior officials said that the country is entering a period of \u201cmomentous change\u201d. Given\nhow little is known about him, it is still difficult\nto gauge how important this really is.\nNorth Korea has, since 1977, been advocating \u201cGrand National Unity\u201d under the principle\nof \u201cTwo Systems, One Country\u201d. South Korea\nand the International Community supported\nthis and formed a plan of action at conferences in 2000 and 2007. This has now been\nabandoned by South Korea\u2019s new government.\nNorth Korea was further isolated when its proposed denuclearisation talks in January were\nthrown out by the United States.\nThe physical changes, the conferences and\nthe possibility of reunification are not why we\nshould be hopeful about North Korea; it is the\nchanging attitude of the government. Previously, the country took the ideal of \u2018Songun\u2019, or\nthe \u2018military first\u2019 revolutionary attitude. This\nprioritised the military above all other government departments, which has resulted in the\ncurrent state of a huge army but little investment in any other area. Now, however, officials\ntalk of a \u201cgreat, prosperous and powerful nation\u201d by 2012.\nIt is because of these signals of change that\nthe new report calls for a new era of dialogue\nwith the isolated country. A first step would be\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nEdited by Kenneth Lee\nUnited States\nGreece has suspended all international mail and\nparcel services for 48 hours to allow authorities to\ninspect all outgoing mail. This comes after a series\nof mail bombs were sent to foreign embassies in\nAthens and other destinations in Europe. Terrorism\nexperts suspect that an extreme left wing group\ncalled the Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire is responsible for this campaign. They are accused of trying\nto spark a revolution in Greece amidst the economic\ndownturn. Greece was hit especially hard by the\nglobal financial crisis and its economy is expected\nto shrink by up to 4% this year and another 3 % next\nyear.\nGreece a peace conference between the former combatant states; the US, UK, South and North Korea and China, facilitated by a neutral country\nsuch as Sweden or Switzerland. The 6 Party\nTalks, initiated to address the issue of a nuclear\narmed North, should be continued; especially\nin light of recent overtures to denuclearisation\nby the North Korean Foreign Minister. The\nissue of energy insecurity should also be dis-cussed, with help given to the country to build\ndams and other non-nuclear alternatives. Cooperation on humanitarian issues is also sought,\nafter Kim Jong Il banned all foreign aid organisations in a country in which the state spends\nan estimated $2-4 per capita on development.\nNone of this will be possible for as long as\nNorth Korea\u2019s international outlook is that of\nfear and suspicion. The country needs to acknowledge that the Western world does not\nseek to destroy it. It can also learn a lot from\nChina\u2019s economic boom since developing\ngreater co-operation with the West and liberal-ising its policies.\nSome small steps have been made in this vein\nby the British government, which introduced a\nscholarship for North Koreans to study in the\nUK. Canada has also provided English language software to the country\u2019s universities.\nThe fact that North Korea invited Lord Alton\nand Baroness Cox to the country, despite their\nopen criticism of the government\u2019s human\nrights record, is also a welcome move.\nInspired by the Helsinki Accords which dealt\nwith the USSR, this approach may be the wisest option for securing peace in the region in\nlight of a more open North Korea. Given the\nnuclear capabilities of all involved, the penalties for failing to act may make this the only\noption.\nUS Republicans have seized the House of Representatives in mid-term elections, dealing a severe\nblow to President Barack Obama\u2019s ability to pass\nlaws. President Obama has called John Boehnerthe House minority leader to congratulate him and\nto discuss their priorities. John Boehner is expected\nto take over the role of House leader from Democrat Nancy Pelosi once the new Congress has been\nsworn in. Meanwhile, the Republicans despite making huge gains in the November midterms, failed to\ntake over the Senate with the Democrats securing\nat least half of the 100 seats in the Senate. The Republicans benefited from\nvoter discontent over the\nstalling US\neconomy and\nthe persistently high jobless\nrate.\nSouth Korea\nSouth Korea\u2019s navy has fired warning shots to drive\naway a North Korean fishing vessel near the disputed maritime border. This is the second incident in six\ndays and comes after South Korean and North Korean troops exchanged gunfire near the DMZ. South\nKorean security forces have been put on high alert,\nanti-aircraft missiles are at the ready, shipping and\nair routes are under heightened surveillanc, ahead\nof next week\u2019s G20 meeting in Seoul. North Korea\nhas in the past used high profile events in the South\nto bolster its standing and to embarrass the South.\nThis week\u2019s report from Lord Alton and Baroness Cox,\nfollowing their latest visit to North Korea, argues that we\nshould be building bridges, not walls with the hermit state\nRajat Jain\nRory Fenton\nPyongyang has developed behind a veil\nFriday 05 November 2010\n\n"

Unless otherwise specified,\nyou\u2019re going to need the Adobe Flash Player plug-in\nwhich can be installed from http://get.adobe.com/\nflashplayer/.\nAVOIDAL\navoidal.com\n\u2018Enemies as weapons\u2019 is the idea behind this mouse-controlled arcade game. Destroy the blue stars by\nsetting off the traps that you must yourself avoid - red\nstars will chase you around the screen and yellow\nspikes fly in a straight line when activated. It sounds\npretty easy, but when there\u2019s enemies bearing down\non you and no way to escape a small panic does\nstart to set in. Graphics aren\u2019t particularly amazing\nbut at least they don\u2019t get in the way. A good way to\nspend an idle ten minutes.\nSean Harbison\n28\nWelcome back to the Kingdom of Albion! 50\nyears on from the setting of Fable II, Fable III\ntells the story of a prince having to overthrow\nthe tyrant king that is his brother. The game\ntakes you through the prince\u2019s role at the head\nof the revolution having to complete quests in\norder to convince faction leaders that you are\nworthy to start the uprising.\nFable III and its predecessors have many\nsimilarities. The graphics are essentially the\nsame, though this is no bad thing. The attention\nto detail remains extremely high and the theme\nbenefits from the cartoony-style. The voice acting is extraordinary, featuring a top cast of John\nCleese, Stephen Fry and Simon Pegg. Having\nyour character complimented by these great\nactors feels like an amazing achievement! The\ncomedy associated with previous Fable games\nalso returns. You often find yourself laughing\nat random comments from passers-by, which\nreally makes the game enjoyable.\nThe combat is identical to the previous\ngames, and it can get repetitive and boring. It\noffers no challenge and really detracts from the\nbetter points of the game. This has always been\na flaw of the Fable series and you would have\nthought on their third attempt Lionhead Studios\ncould have made some alterations to improve\nsuch an integral part of the gameplay. Combat\nhas only improved in the smoothness of swapping weapons: it\u2019s easy to switch from bashing\nsomeone\u2019s face in with a sword to shooting the\nnext man with a pistol. This time around the\nfluidity of combat is much better than in Fable\nII as delay between actions is minimal, giving\na real feeling that you\u2019re controlling an experienced fighter.\nThe weapon choice has fallen dramatically.\nFable II allowed you to collect a large combination of weapons and choose between them\nwhich gave a varied armoury. Disappointingly, Fable III gives a much smaller choice\nTreadmillasaurus Rex\njmtb02.com/treadmillasaurus-rex\nDinosaurs. Lasers. Partying. Three things that are\nundeniably awesome, so if you were to mix these\nthings together you might think that the product\nwould be a game of epic proportions. And you\u2019d be\nright. The titular treadmill will push T-Rex back and\nforth between the lasers and spiked balls force him\nto jump, causing the wheel to spin. Where it lands\nis (presumeably) random, and with certain spaces\nactiving laser light shows, confetti showers and top\nhats, things get very epic very quickly. Whether the\nwheel ever lands on \u2018Win The Game\u2019 is debatable, so\nif that happens to you then let us know!\nbut causes your weapons to change depending\non your actions. This actually gives a smaller\narray of weapons as there are essentially two\npossibilities for each weapon: good or evil.\nLevelling up also takes a new route, as rather\nthan gaining experience by using one type of\nweapon (ranged, etc.) you can spend your acquired guild seals to upgrade styles of fighting.\nA great addition is the ability to mix spells.\nWhereas being a mage in the previous games\nmeant mastering one spell and using that to the\ndeath, you now upgrade all spells at the same\ntime and then can mix and match, combining\nthe likes of fire and electricity in one spell.\nOnce again the majority of the game is\ntaken up earning people\u2019s respect by completing quests to collect guild seals. The number\nof seals you have determines whether a faction\nwill help you start the revolution. Fable III\u2019s\nquests are more engaging and lengthier which\nis relieving as previously Fable quests felt too\nsimilar and repetitive. Exploration is still im-portant, and there are plenty of discoverable\ncaves and buildings. However, sometimes the\ntreasure inside is not proportional to the effort.\nYou can spend hours exploring a cave finding\nonly a bandit\u2019s outfit, which is a complete let\ndown and a real disappointment.\nMorality is at the core of Fable III, as with\nthe previous games, but the decisions you must\nmake are much more difficult. The subtleties\nand ambiguities of morality are brought to light\nand show the darker side of being a ruler. Right\nfrom the start you must make a horrific choice,\nshowing yourself as a selfish or selfless leader.\nThe difficulty of this first decision surprised me\nbut it\u2019s a great opening as the game instantly\nthrows you into the deep end. The game leads\ntowards you becoming ruler of Albion and\neventually, on taking the throne, your every\ndecision visibly shapes the world around you.\nFable III allows you to relive the enjoyable experiences of Fable I & II, however it\nfails to bring enough new features or repair\nflaws which both predecessors contained. If\nyou\u2019re looking for a completely new experience prepare to be disappointed. Nonetheless, whether you are a fan of the series or a\nnewcomer, Fable III is thoroughly enjoyable and I highly recommend you get it!\nPolynomial proves maths isn\u2019t fun\nThe Polynomial - Space Of The Music, far from\nbeing just a mathematical expression, is a 3D\nmusic action game in which you pilot a space\nship through a brightly coloured universe that\npulsates along to currently playing song.\nThe premise is simple: you select a certain\nmusic track, and the game will use it to generate an environment that corresponds to the tune.\nFor example, in another popular music game\ncalled Audiosurf, where you pilot a ship along\na racecourse, a fast, upbeat track will have a\nlot of slopes and steep gradients, whilst a slow,\ncalming piece will have you leisurely making\nyour way uphill. As a big fan of Audiosurf, I\nwas expecting Polynomial to deliver as well.\nMy first words when I loaded up were \u2018bloody\nhell\u2019. The menu options at first appear quite\ncomplex for such a simple game, but when you\nfiddle about with them you realise that a lot of\nthe controls simply modify the brightness and\nsound. I recommend adding your own music\nwhen you first load up the game; not because\nthe stock tunes are bad, but I play music games\nto have fun and it\u2019s much easier to do that when\nyou\u2019re listening to music you enjoy.\nThe instructions make Polynomial seem\nmore complicated than it really is. The first\nlevel has a huge floating set of instructions that\ntell you what everything does: orange monsters\ndamage you, blue... things heal you and green\ncircles offer power-ups. That\u2019s all you really\nneed to know. Point, shoot, fly about, simple as.\nFor a game that supposedly tailors itself to\nfit your music, I was hard-pressed to see how\nthings changed when music tracks switched. I\ntried a switch from a hard, upbeat Pendulum\ntrack to a much calmer Rachmaninoff piece,\nand I didn\u2019t see any changes to the game. I suppose this wouldn\u2019t matter so much if the game\nwas fun, but unfortunately Polynomial doesn\u2019t\nhave much else going for it.\nAfter half an hour you feel like you\u2019re playing in an elaborate screensaver and repetitive-ness starts to kick in. You fly about, shoot stuff,\nand listen to your music. The graphics are very\npretty, and it does have a certain beauty to it,\nbut it\u2019s just not fun. There is an editing mode\nwhich I toyed about with for a bit, but unless\ntweaking about with a load of figures and seeing what they do appeals to you, I doubt it\u2019ll\nkeep you hooked.\nIf you\u2019re looking to try out a similar game,\nmy advice would be to pick Audiosurf. It\u2019s\nnearly two and a half years old, but I still play\nit and have fun. Polynomial feels less like a\ngame and more of an elaborate tech demo. A\npretty one maybe, but a tech demo nonetheless.\nIt could have been so much more.\nLaurence Pope\nFriday 05 NOVEMber 2010\n\n"

    "content": "SPORT\n38 felix\nFRIDAY 5 NOVEMBER 2010\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSports Editors: Jovan Nedic\nDavid Wilson\nFelix Sports League\nsponsored by\nThe Imperial Immortals American Football\nClub took another positive step towards starting the regular season off brightly by attending\na pre-season training camp hosted by the long\nstanding Cardiff Cobras University AFC.\nThe team touched down in Cardiff Friday\nnight, and after a warm reception by the Cardiff lads, began training the following day at\n11AM sharp. The morning session concentrated on fundamentals, which are the basis of\nany strong contesting football team. This was\na great chance for the rookies to test their skills\nagainst different players in a friendly environ-ment, and a good opportunity for the returners\nto be coached outside of their comfort zone.\nFortunately the teams escaped the rain and after short team specific playbook sessions the\nteams resumed afternoon practice. Working on\nthe often forgotten \u2018special teams\u2019aspect of the\ngame was the focus of the afternoon, and for\nmany of the rookies this was their first experience of kickoffs and punt scenarios. With the\nsession over, the long day ended after plenty\nof pizza and socialising with the Cobras, and\nanother memorable night in Cardiff.\nSunday started light, as the main event of the\nGeorge Barnes\nImmortals join Cobras\nfor pre-season camp\nOn Saturday 30th\nOctober the first ever Netball\nFun Day was hosted by ICUNC. The day started with the sun shining, a clear sky and a lot of\nexcitable Netball girls.\nAs 2 o\u2019clock approached, numbers at the\ncourts began to grow, with members from not\njust the netball club, but rugby and hockey, and\neven a few bioengineers as well. After a quick\nwarm up game of touch rugby, everyone prepared for the Grudge Match between the Netball girls and Rugby boys.\nPlayers were called on court but the only\nshooter for the girls, Nicole, was yet to arrive.\nSo usual defenders, Bernice and Nakai, bravely\nstepped up to the plate and put on the GA and\nGS bibs. As the whistle blew for the first centre\npass, the girls fully realised just how fast the\nboys could move. C and WA duo for the boys,\nJamie and Joe showed off their dodging skills,\nand despite WD, Becky, and C, Emma, playing excellently for the girls, the boys managed\nto successfully get the ball down into their\ngoal third. GD Lorna defended brilliantly, but\nGA Chris was very nippy, and could jump unexpectedly high for his height, and GS Max\nshowed lovely movement in the goal third,\nmeaning that the score was level at the end of\nthe first quarter.\nA quick switch around of positions took place\nin the quarter break. Nicole was put on as GA\nfor the girls so that there was an actual shooter\nin the goal third. WA, Lucie, successfully received centre pass after centre pass, getting\nthe ball down to the shooters. Brilliant defending from GK for the boys, Caolan, meant that\nshots were pretty much being tipped right out\nof the net! Even though Caolan could jump ridiculously high, this was not enough to hold the\ngirls back and at the end of the first half they\nwere ahead. (Apparently the boys\u2019 lack of ability to stop running after catching the ball was\nnot advantageous to them!)\nHowever, things began to go downhill for the\ngirls after this as player of the match (and top\ngoal scorer for the day), Rob Dowden, demonstrated that boys can actually play Netball\nwhilst sticking to the rules. His great play (and\na lot of luck for the boys in general) meant that\nthe game ended in a 7-6 victory for the boys.\nPerhaps this victory will spur the boys on to\nwin their second most important game of the\nyear, the JPR Williams Varsity match!\nThough the girls lost this match they didn\u2019t\nlet it dampen the mood for the rest of the day,\nwith a tournament taking place between all\nthose present. There was foul play. There was\namazing play. There were complaints against\nthe umpires. There were a few injuries. There\nwas a LOT of rain. But most of all, there was\nfun had by everybody. ICUNC would like to\nthank everyone that came and made the day\nsuch a success!\nFern Gibbons\nRugby exec beat netball\ngirls at their first annual\nNetball Fun Day\nweekend was the full scrimmage planned for\nthat afternoon. The coaches tried to touch up on\nthe technique taught to the players on the Saturday during the morning session. By the afternoon both players and coaches were pumped\nfor the scrimmage. The Immortals\u2019 defenders\nwere rusty but held their own against a strong\nCobras offence, a positive sign for the upcoming season. Rookies Ben and Dhayan were\nthrown into the deep end but played extremely\nwell considering their relative inexperience.\nThe offence started slowly making similar mistakes to last season, however by the second half\nthere were clear signs of improvement from the\nentirely revamped O. First downs seemed less\nhard to come by, especially with great running\nfrom fullback Alistair.\nWith the weekend over, Cardiff provided a\ngreat experience for rookies and returners alike.\nEveryone satiated their football hunger, and\nboth teams seemed to gain a great deal from\nintensive training and hard hitting. It is hoped\nthe greater intensity, hard work and dedication\nshown by the Immortals in the preseason will\ntranslate to regular season success.\nThe Immortals play their first game on November 7th, at home to the Surrey Stingers and\ncheered on by the newly formed IC CheerSoc.\nJust in case you\u2019re confused, the netball goal is the one without the backboard...\nTeam P W D L F A Diff Index\n1 Netball W1 3 3 0 0 148 57 91 5\n2 Hockey W1 3 3 0 0 11 7 2 5\n3 Table Tennis M2 2 2 0 0 33 1 32 5\n4 Netball W2 2 2 0 0 77 50 27 5\n5 Table Tennis M1 2 2 0 0 30 4 26 5\n6 Tennis W1 2 2 0 0 17 5 12 5\n7 Basketball W1 2 2 0 0 85 74 11 5\n8 Table Tennis W1 2 2 0 0 10 0 10 5\n9 Badminton M1 2 2 0 0 12 4 8 5\n10 Tennis M1 2 2 0 0 16 8 8 5\n11 Fencing M2 1 1 0 0 135 41 94 5\n12 Basketball M1 1 1 0 0 76 58 18 5\n13 ICSM Football M2 1 1 0 0 5 1 4 5\n14 Squash W1 1 1 0 0 4 0 4 5\n15 ICSM Badminton W1 1 1 0 0 10 4 0 5\n16 Rugby M1 4 3 0 1 98 53 45 2.75\n17 ICSM Netball W1 3 2 0 1 134 80 54 2\n18 ICSM Hockey W1 3 2 0 1 14 3 11 2\n19 Hockey M3 3 2 0 1 5 2 3 2\n20 Football M1 3 1 1 1 6 6 0 1\n21 ICSM Hockey M2 3 1 1 1 5 8 -3 1\n22 Fencing W2 2 1 0 1 241 221 20 0.5\n23 Fencing M3 2 1 0 1 246 237 9 0.5\n24 Football M3 2 1 0 1 11 3 8 0.5\n25 Hockey M4 2 1 0 1 4 2 8 0.5\n26 Lacrosse M1 2 1 0 1 31 23 8 0.5\n27 ICSM Football M1 2 1 0 1 9 4 5 0.5\n28 Netball W3 2 1 0 1 42 38 4 0.5\n29 Hockey M1 2 1 0 1 5 5 0 0.5\n30 ICSM Badminton M1 2 1 0 1 8 8 0 0.5\n31 Squash M3 2 1 0 1 5 5 0 0.5\n32 ICSM Netball W4 2 1 0 1 44 74 -30 0.5\n33 Rugby M4 2 1 0 1 43 74 -31 0.5\n34 Fencing M1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n35 Fencing W1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n36 Ice Hockey M1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n37 ICSM Football M3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n38 Lacrosse W1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n39 Lacrosse W2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n40 Squash M1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n41 Volleyball M1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n42 Volleyball W1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n43 Water Polo M1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n44 Water Polo W1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n45 Squash M2 3 1 0 2 6 9 -3 -1\n46 ICSM Netball W2 3 1 0 2 96 100 -4 -1\n47 Rugby M3 3 1 0 2 10 19 -9 -1\n48 ICSM Hockey M3 3 1 0 2 4 17 -13 -1\n49 Football W1 1 0 0 1 1 6 -5 -4\n50 ICSM Rugby M3 1 0 0 1 0 84 -84 -4\n51 Hockey M2 2 0 0 2 2 4 -2 -4\n52 Squash M4 2 0 0 2 2 4 -2 -4\n53 ICSM Hockey M1 2 0 0 2 1 4 -3 -4\n54 Badminton M2 2 0 0 2 5 11 -6 -4\n55 ICSM Badminton M2 2 0 0 2 5 11 -6 -4\n56 Hockey W2 2 0 0 2 0 7 -7 -4\n57 Badminton W1 2 0 0 2 4 12 -8 -4\n58 Football M2 2 0 0 2 2 10 -8 -4\n59 ICSM Hockey W2 2 0 0 2 0 16 -16 -4\n60 Tennis M2 2 0 0 2 0 22 -22 -4\n61 ICSM Netball W3 2 0 0 2 29 66 -37 -4\n62 Rugby M2 3 0 0 3 29 80 -51 -4\n63 ICSM Rugby M2 3 0 0 3 29 149 -120 -4\n64 ICSM Rugby M1 4 0 0 4 53 173 -120 -4\n\n"

Jack Patten of\nImperial, thrown by the very different styles\nof fencing shown by some of the continental\nfencers, was knocked out in the quarter finals,\nleaving only two remaining, who unfortunately met each other in the semi final. Guillaume Joubert managed to pull the victory from\nJack Patten\nOur proud fencers posing with their impressive medal haul\nsee Alumni George Whittaker had won GB heavyweight trials overall. Simon Steele brought home\nIC\u2019s quickest single time of the day (19:31.3 \u2013 15th\nin BUCS). Further solid performances came from\nDom Meyrick-Cole (19:45.0 \u2013 51st GB trialist),\nLeo Carrington (19:50.0 \u2013 21st in BUCS) and Ben\nSpencer-Jones (20:07.7 \u2013 72nd GB trialist, 33rd in\nBUCS). Leonora Kennedy and Zo\u00eb Lee continued\nto go from strength to strength as they both were\nin the top ten overall with times for the women\u2019s\nsingle of 20:58.3 (8th overall) and 21:09.8 (10th\noverall) respectively.\nJamie Kirkwood continues to have a golden glow\naround him as he smashed his way to win the lightweight trials. Further lightweight success continued for Sam Scrimgeour (18:44.2 \u2013 12th Lwt GB\ntrialist), Josh Butler (18:44.5 \u2013 13th Lwt GB trial-ist), Alex Gillies (18:55.9 \u2013 17th Lwt GB trialist)\nand Tom Pearson (19:37.1 \u2013 35th Lwt GB trialist,\n7th BUCS). Chloe Symmonds also put in a strong\nperformance in the women\u2019s lightweight single\n(21:52.2 \u2013 12th Lwt GB trialist, 9th BUCS).\nIC also fielded a further five boats with the aim of\ngaining BUCS points and medals. In the doubles,\nBen Spencer-Jones andAlistair Hudson came 6th in\na time of 17:55.9, while the W2x of Christina Duffy\nand Selina Graham came 4th in a time of 20:30.0.\nUnfortunately due to the absence of many of the\nclub\u2019s bowsiders; due to man flu/busted joints/doc-tors orders etc, the lightweight men\u2019s double had to\nbe withdrawn and it was down to four strokesiders\nto race the pairs.\nOn top of this, chaos nearly ensued when the\npleasure cruiser, the \u201cBoston Belle\u201d, decided the\nstart of the third and final division would be the\nperfect time to head down the centre of the river,\nheading directly towards the fifty boats coming in\nthe opposite direction. Fortunately, disaster was\naverted and the Belle pulled into the side. In the\nMen\u2019s Championship Pairs, Imperial A (Steele/\nCarrington), having already successfully overtaken\nDurham B, were heard from the bank employing a\nKirkwood Tiger [a now well known winning mech-anism] with 100m to go and they raced their way\ninto fourth place (18:51.8). Imperial B (Matt Whaley/Pearson) put in another storming performance\novertaking \u201cthree and a half crews\u201d over the 5km\ncourse and beat Imperial A by five seconds to bring\nhome the Bronze medal (18:46.9). The women\u2019s\npair of Symmonds and Duffy also brought home\nthe bacon coming in second (21:12.9) behind a very\nstrong Durham crew.\nAll in all, the weekend was a success and, in time\nhonoured tradition, McDonalds was eaten on the\nway home with delight, even by the conscientious\nlightweights. With Fours Head of the River less\nthan two weeks away, ICBC has little time to reflect\nand needs to be ready for a few more miles on the\nhome water of the Tideway.\nICBC hit GB trials and BUCS Small Boats Head\n...Continued from back page\n\u201cOur fencers put in an impressive\ndisplay, with four of the top five\nfencers being from Imperial, who\ncame away with a gold, silver and\na bronze\u201d\nChris Gilliam, who ended coming in third.\nGuillaume faced Maltese fencer Pierre Bianchi, but was finally defeated, earning a silver\nmedal and the respect of the opposition.\nThe men\u2019s sabre event saw the same group\ngoing into the fastest of the three weapons.\nAgain Jack was knocked out in his first direct elimination fight, but this time Chris and\nGuillaume almost effortlessly moved on to\nthe finals against each other. After a back and\nforth fight Guillaume managed to shut down\nthe wrist hits that Chris had used to get to the\nfinals, earning him the gold that had been denied him earlier in the day, with Chris\u2019 silver\nbringing the medal count to four after only\ntwo events.\nThe last event of the first day was a fun\nteam sabre event where all of the fencers were\nmixed up to let fencers from different countries and at different skill levels to interact in\na less competitive setting. Even fencers who\nrarely use a sabre picked one up for a bit of\nfun.\nThe next day began the women\u2019s events,\nthough rather than being the official Malta\nopen, the two women fencers from Imperial\nwere competing in the St. Paul\u2019s Fencing Club\nChallenge, a new event run by the same fencing club which holds the open.\nAs the men were relegated to the sidelines,\nthe women started on foil, which neither had\na particular love of. Despite this, both moved\nthrough the initial stages of the competition\nwith little trouble, adapting to the more unusual styles of fencing on display. Unfortunately,\nas with the men, they ended meeting in the\nsemifinals, with Beth slowly out fencing Emily Bottle, to move on to the finals. In the final\nBeth met her match in German fencer Barbara\nSchormair, letting her bring home the silver\nmedal, and Emily the bronze.\nThe epee event, being Beth\u2019s least favorite\nweapon, saw her knocked out in the quarter-finals. Emily destroyed any competition she\nwas up against, however, as this is her primary\nweapon. The finals saw her comprehensively\ndefeat German epeeist Vanessa Klaas.\nThe team event of the day was epee. Even\nJack and Guillaume picked them up \u2013 despite\nneither of them finding them the most interesting weapon, and Jack having never used one\nbefore at all!\nDuring the week the fencers took some time\nto explore the country, whilst more fencers arrived for the rest of the week, and to do the\nsecond weekend competition. On Monday\nthey headed out to try diving, which Chris and\nBeth decided to spend some more time on.\nThey also enjoyed a meal in the capital Valletta with the competition fencers and their\nspouses. Tuesday was spent at St. Paul\u2019s Fencing Club for some training with the Maltese\nand some of the other international fencers.\nThey spent some time exploring Mdina, a\nfortified town in the hills, a relic and monument to the military history of Malta as a naval\nstaging point for several wars. On Friday they\ntook a couple of speedboats out to do some\nsnorkelling and have a look at the nearby islands of Gozo and Comino.\nThe second weekend started with the men\u2019s\nindividual epee event. After a round of poules\nChris had opened into a good position, while\nJack\u2019s inexperience in epee had left him in\na mediocre position, and led to him being\nknocked out in the first round of direct elimi-nation. Chris managed to make it through to\nthe quarterfinals, defeated by British fencer\nEddie Crofton, who was only defeated in the\nfinal by Pierre.\nThen it was time to start the open for the\nwomen\u2019s events. The first weapon was epee,\nand once again Emily found herself quickly\nleading the pack. She even defeated her mother in the semi-finals, to face off against fellow\nImperial competitor Joan Chang in the finals.\nJoan\u2019s style gave Emily pause in the first set,\nbut was finally broken in the next set, winning\nEmily the gold, and Joan the silver.\nThe afternoon saw the team foil event. This\nhad lots of entrants as most fencers start by\nlearning foil and despite everyone trying hard\nto beat everyone else, the atmosphere was jo-vial. The competitors had become close over\nthe week.\nThe last day of the competition opened with\nwomen\u2019s foil. Our fencers put on an impressive display, with four of the top five fencers\nbeing from Imperial, Hannah Bryars beating\nout Emily in the semi-finals and Alice Mitchell in the final, for a nice gold, silver, bronze\nrun, with Beth being just outside the medal\nzone in fifth.\nThe last individual event was women\u2019s sabre,\nwhere Imperial did even better, the top five being entirely Imperial. Alice took fifth and Joan\nand Helen Pennington became bronze medal-lists. After some back and forth in the final\nBeth took silver and Hannah earned the gold.\nAnother team sabre event was the last event\nof the day, and the competition, this time with\nmixed gender teams. A chance to say goodbye\nwith some light hearted stabbing.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 35\nRolling towards the beginning of November, with the weather turning cold\nand grey, and Bonfire Night approach-ing, our minds turn back to the last\nfireworks display that was witnessed\nby members of Imperial College Sinfonietta.\nThe annual tour took place in the last\nweek and a half of September. Being the\ntenth in a long line of epic voyages to\nforeign climes, it turned into a bit of a re-union, with many of the older members\nof the orchestra who have long since\ngraduated returning for another taster of\nSinfonietta Rampaging. It started unre-markably; beer and a fry-up in the departure lounge at Gatwick was followed\nby a quick flight to Porto, a ride on the\nMetro and setting up camp in a hostel.\nBut the fun soon began. The first tour\ndinner is a bit of a blur for this writer;\nwith the local beer, Super Bock, at just\none Euro a bottle, the week had begun in\nthe manner in which it was to continue.\nEach day in the city started with those\nwho woke up early enough finding a\nquick breakfast in one of the many caf\u00e9s, followed by a walk across town to\nthe Conservatoire, a school of music for\n6 to 18 year olds that opened last year.\nHere, we rehearsed for three hours, with\na gap in the middle for a picnic lunch\nand 1.5 litres of water\u2026 The venue was\nbrand new, and we the first orchestra\nthey hosted. Problems aside (no house-lights and air conditioning blasting up\nfrom the floor and chilling everyone), it\nhoused us well, and allowed for a productive session every day.\nAfternoons were spent exploring little\nalleys winding over steep hills, climbing\nchurch towers and generally being tour-isty. Porto being the home of port, we\nwent on a port factory tour after a trek\nover the mountains of the town (don\u2019t\nalways trust someone with a guide-book\njust because they have the book\u2026),\nwhich was followed by a quick recov-ery, helped along by tasters!\nAs the sun set, the bars on the waterfront found themselves host to groups\nof musicians, with merriment and consumption often accompanied by games,\nphotographs, and once, a song about\nthe man in charge in which we were\njoined by wandering gypsies with their\naccompaniment; a dog. A good deal of\ntable-swapping followed as we found\neach other, much to the bemusement\nof the locals; \u201cinside voices\u201d and \u201cpipe\ndown\u201d did nothing to encourage us to\ndecrease the decibels as we found \u2018longlost\u2019 friends from the bar before the last\none\u2026\nMembers of the orchestra were encouraged to engage in a game of assas-sins, resulting in a \u2018tour word\u2019 of \u201cbulbous!\u201d, a few epic kills (not to mention\nmembers of the committee abusing their\npower to get their targets) and more than\none person complaining \u2018I thought you\nwanted to talk to me, but you just wanted to kill me!\u2019. Clothes-pegs also made\nan appearance, leading to \u2018peg-checks\u2019;\nand more than one unsuspecting member of the public walking off with fluorescent bits of plastic clipped to them.\nMonday night found us performing\nto an audience that was certainly larger\nthan the predicted two, a result of handing out 1000 flyers to the people walking about the town earlier in the after-noon. It went well; all the hard work\npaid off, and the comments received indicated that the audience loved it. These\nincluded phrases such as \u201ca dream come\ntrue\u201d and \u201csplendid\u201d. Good job!\nThe tour ended with a visit to the\nbeach, dinner at a restaurant which\nserved giant dishes of fish-pie and\nroast pork, and a visit to a shisha bar in\nwhich tour prizes were given for various misdeeds committed throughout the\nweek. The van was sent off on Wednesday morning to the high praise of \u201cMy\nsecond best tour\u2026after Croatia\u201d, from\nthe Sinfonietta Matriarch, who organised Croatia and hence her opinion on\nthat one is discredited. The rampaging\ndidn\u2019t end on the plane (the Captain did\nget pegged as he left the plane in London) and we gradually parted ways with\nmuch regret, many memories and much\nstronger friendships.\nAnd the fireworks? Porto celebrated\nthe presence of Sinfonietta by giving\nan impromptu display while we were\nsitting at the waterfront one evening. It\nwasn\u2019t actually for us, but the sight of a\nwhole orchestra jumping up from a bar,\nstill clutching tankards full of beer, and\nrunning to the river to ooh and ahh, is\none of the highlights of the trip; for the\nauthor of this article, anyway.\nCongratulations to the team who organised it, many thanks to our wonderful conductor (DC al fine!), and well\ndone members of the orchestra; we\nmade it back in one piece and look forward to next year!\nCorrie Berry\nDoes God exist?\nA question that has thwarted man since\nthe beginning of human history was\nbrought to a heated and intensely intellectual debate on Tuesday evening.\nThe Philosophy Society\u2019s \u201cDoes God\nExist?\u201d debate challenged some of the\nmost able polemicists in the university\nworld. Prof. Peter Atkins, a renowned\nOxford Professor and outspoken atheist\nand Alex Gabriel, the President of the\nOxford Atheist Society, would be arguing that God didn\u2019t exist, while Hassan\nChoudhury (author of \u201cGod\u2019s ID\u201d) and\nDr Muhammad Umar (freelance consultant and medic) would demonstrate\nproof for God\u2019s existence.\nWith Prof. Atkins beginning the de-bate, the atheists proceeded first. The\nroom fell silent, as all present were either\nready to support or rebut his arguments.\nFrom the beginning Prof. Atkins made it\nclear that it was not his job to disprove\nthe existence of God, but instead the job\nof the theists was to prove that God ex-ists; an interesting approach, but a weak\nstance to be taken by a world-renowned\nprofessor such as Atkins. Many present\nwere expecting him to deliver an all-en-compassing argument to disprove God\u2019s\nexistence. Instead, he wandered along\nthe lines of lack of available evidence,\nciting the desire of humans to create a\ndeity and the belief that all people will\nget what they deserve in the afterlife.\nThe atheists were off to a shaky start,\nbut surely things could only get better\nfor them?\nNext, Choudhury was setting the stage\nfor his colleague, Dr Umar, to deliver\nthe proof for the existence of God. Using what the atheists typically call upon,\nscience, to disprove God, he used it\nagainst them demonstrating its limita-tions; this included that science can\nonly prove what it can test and observe,\nnothing more and nothing less. Science\ncannot prove what is immeasurable and\nbeyond the limits of science. Furthermore, adding weight to their argument\nis that \u2018creation requires a creator\u2019, and\nhow a painting (or a pizza) could not be\ntested for a creator if the creator was not\n\u2018noticed\u2019from the creation. By using rational arguments and dismissing weaker\narguments such as emotions, faith and\nbelief (one of the few issues which were\nargued by both sides for the whole eve-ning), proof was presented for a creator\nof the Universe.\nOne would have expected Gabriel\nto be more than ready to rip apart and\nundermine the opposition\u2019s arguments.\nSurprisingly he failed to do so. More\noften than not, he was stumbling for\nwords, evading the arguments and sidetracking the concept of the proof. Had\nthe theists succeeded in presenting an\nargument that had no flaws? Well, Gabriel never disproved it. Dr Umar\u2019s\npresentation was one of the most enjoyable of the evening; he engaged the\naudience and speakers alike, holding everyone\u2019s attention throughout. The issue\nof the beginning of the Universe began\nto dominate the discussion, along with\nthe concept of infinity. He proved how\nthere could not be an infinite number\nof causes to start the Universe, known\nas the infinite regression argument, nor\nhow a spontaneous mechanical event\ncould have occurred. He synthesised his\nargument, firmly based in the realms of\nrationale, that the cause had to be external to the Universe, space and time in\norder to create them, demonstrating the\nnecessity for a creator. Now, it was up to\nthe atheists to disprove this during the\nQ&A session.\nNo atheist in attendance addressed\nDr Umar\u2019s argument; instead, they\nevaded the issue like ninjas, which, in\nall fairness to them, they did very well.\nThe atmosphere was intense, the audience electric as questions, answers and\nrebuttal were thrown back and forth,\nevolving into a philosophical discussion where many aspects of human na-ture, science and the fundamentals of\nmathematics were discussed. The concept of infinity not working in reality\nreally seemed to bewilder the atheists\nmore than anything, requiring numerous explanations and examples to show\nwhy it cannot work in practice whilst\nits existence is plausible in mathemat-ics. The atheists\u2019 arguments (well,\nmore like statements) were dissolving\nrapidly as the speakers\u2019 points became\nweaker and less viable.\nBy the end of the evening, everyone\nwas discussing the \u201cExistence of God\u201d,\nand this continued long into the night\n(even after all the free food was gone).\nThe big question that remains: what is\nthe consequence of believing in God?\nSurely the next event will be of a similar magnitude where everyone, including you, could take part.

But what\nhave I really seen in all of those plac-es? Fancy hotels with pleasantly warm\nswimming pools, crowded promenades\nholding gazillions of restaurants you\u2019ve\nalready seen in London, every minute of\nyour excursions \u2018kindly\u2019 organised by\na travel agency. It all merges into one\ncommercial vacation experience \u2013 everything looks and feels the same.\nI\u2019ve been a volunteer freak since before I can remember, and \u201chelping out\nanyone, anywhere\u201d is my motto (and\nis probably the reason I\u2019m studying\nMedicine). With this attitude in mind I\nwas lucky enough to stumble upon the\ncharity Link Community Development.\nWhen they sold me the idea of hitchhiking across Europe in addition to some\nworthwhile fundraising I was instantly\nbought.\nHitchhiking? I immediately pictured\nthe 70\u2019s: flower power, free love and\ncrazy decisions usually made whilst\n\u2018under the influence\u2019. I was sure that no\none did this anymore \u2013 I couldn\u2019t have\nbeen more wrong. With LCD alone\nthere have been almost seven thousand\nstudents who have thumbed their way\nacross Europe in the past 20 years! That\nconvinced me (and my parents) that if\nother people had done it, I could too.\nAnd with my frustration for package\nfamily holidays growing, hitchhiking\nseemed like the perfect alternative. Unpredictable and adrenaline-filled: exactly what you need when you\u2019ve just\nhit your 20\u2019s!\nThe two proposed destinations were\nMorocco and Prague: naturally I chose\nPrague, which is closer to my Polish\nheart. Packing my bag proved to be\nthe first major challenge: I\u2019m used to\nthe luxury of applying tons of lotions,\nconditioners and other miraculous goo\nto every inch of my body, not to mention compulsory outfit changes at least\ntwice a day. How to fit all of these essentials into one tiny rucksack... After\nmuch blood, sweat and tears I managed\nto pack \u2018lightly\u2019 and was ready to go. I\ngrabbed my hitch partner and there we\nwere, setting off from Bristol on what\nwas advertised as the most epic journey\nof our lives.\nOur first lift, a shiny Porsche, stopped\njust few inches from our feet.

The only\nflaw in this dream of mine was that the\nhappiness lasted less than 40 miles, and\nbefore we knew it we were on the hunt\nfor another lift.\nWe quickly realised that hitching from\npetrol stations was the way forward. You\ndon\u2019t feel as lonely as when you stand on\nthe side of some dodgy road, and there\nare always snacks and drinks available\nin the event of a munching crisis. Petrol stations are also the best place to talk\nto and meet more new people than you\ncould have managed during your freshers\u2019 week. We were approached by a\nlovely couple who spotted our Prague\nhoodies and a few minutes of chit chat\nlater we were in their car, exchanging\nphone numbers and arranging our meet\nup in Prague, where they arrived a few\ndays later. This rather unbelievable story\nended up with an expensive dinner and\ncountless litres of quality beer in Prague,\nwhich we didn\u2019t even have to pay for\n\u2013 how many friends do you have who\nwould do this for you?\nCalais has never been blessed with such a cheery face\nThe generosity of strangers we met on\nthe road was quite astonishing: people\ndriving extra miles just to drop us off\ncloser to our destination stopped surprising me rather quickly. But when a\nguy drove us all the way to Dover, over\n16 miles away from his original des-tination, I have to say that I was truly\nmoved. There is hope that helpfulness\nand selflessness are not extinct virtues in\ntoday\u2019s world.\nLess than two hours on a ferry and we\nwere in Calais - on the continent at last!\nThe real adventure began here, what\nwith different countries and customs,\nand many drivers who couldn\u2019t speak\nany English. If I had any affinity for\nforeign languages, this was the time for\nthem to shine. Sadly I don\u2019t, so instead\nI just smiled, nodded, pointed, waved\nand performed all kinds of weird moves\nwith my hands trying to explain where\nwe were headed. In the end, maps and\nour finger pointing proved to be the most\neffective method of communication.\nMany hours later and finger points later\nand we made it into Germany.\nI\u2019d hoped that those German classes at\nschool would have paid off that I\u2019d be\nable to lure drivers with ease, but unfortunately it wasn\u2019t my time to shine. As\nthe first car pulled over I eagerly jumped\nto the driver\u2019s window, only to be confronted with Czech rather than German.\nJanek, who turned out to be our saviour,\nwas a loving boyfriend going to visit\nhis girlfriend in \u2013 yes, you guessed it\n\u2013 Prague. A few cute smiles and my seductive gaze, and we were in our final\nlift to the Promised Land. To the accompaniment of Czech Christian rock and\nplentiful snacks from Janek, we arrived\nin Prague later that evening.\nFour crazy days, seventeen lifts, and\ncountless new friends \u2013 an amazing\nhitch experience with truly unforgettable memories. I\u2019m preaching to you all\nand I hope that you listen: ditch cheap\nflights, trains and hired cars \u2013 hitchhike!\nI can assure you that it\u2019ll bring your\ntravelling experience to a much more\nexciting level.\nI\u2019m sure the drivers got the gist\n\n"

    "content": "24\nFILM\nfelix\nA warm and witty\nmodern family film\nRuffalo has been perfectly cast in the role of\nthe sperm donor and you can quite easily see\nhim as the weed-smoking, womanizing college\ndrop-out who donated sperm for money. He\nmay not have graduated from college or have\na fancy job to boast but he isn\u2019t dumb \u2013 and he\ndoes, in fact, give out some very logical advice\nto his children, which makes matters worse for\nNic. She is on the verge of exploding when\nPaul tries to give parenting tips.\nIt\u2019s a shame that the children\u2019s subplots are\nhastily concluded. Wasikowska, (considerably\nbetter here than in Alice in Wonderland) is\ngiven a set of friends she can confide in, but as\nshe prepares and goes off to college, they dis-appear. The same goes for Hutcherson. There\nis a big development when it comes to the\nconflict between his balanced, well-behaved\ncharacter and his best friend\u2019s wilder attitude,\nClassic Cinema\nAkira\nAkira is one of the most important Japanese animated films ever made. It tells the story of best\nfriends Kaneda and Tetsuo, members of a violent\nbiker gang in post-World War III \u201cNeo-Tokyo\u201d, 2019.\nTetsuo discovers he has a huge power he cannot\ncontain, and the consequences for everyone are\ncataclysmic.\nAt first glance, Akira is an answer to the futuris-tic, dystopian Western films of the preceding era\n\u2013 the gang\u2019s costumes and highway battles recall\nMad Max, and Neo-Tokyo\u2019s looming, luminous vastness is directly inspired by Blade Runner. Fans of\nthese kinds of action movies will like Akira, as they\ndid when it was released; consequently, this anim\u00e9\nwas instrumental in introducing English-speakers\nto the wonders of Japanese fiction. From dangerous government experiments and an underground\nresistance to orbital lasers and psionic combat, it\nhas everything an action sci-fi lover could want and\nmore, all centred on a terrifying secret hidden deep\nbeneath the city. Like the best anime and manga, it\ntakes the tropes we\u2019ve already seen to their stylistic and philosophical extremes \u2013 although unfortunately this includes a lengthy and confusing ending,\na frequent problem in anim\u00e9.\nAkira also stands apart thanks to its uniquely Japanese take on the pervasive fears of the Cold War:\nAkira\u2019s Tokyo faces annihilation for a second time\nand its inhabitants cry out for a saviour. Arguably,\nAkira is a reply to Watchmen, the most acclaimed\n\u201cgraphic novel\u201d of all time; both address fears of\nglobal destruction \u2013 and both took their creative\nforms to a new level of quality, garnering legions of\nnew fans in the process.\nEliot Barford\nCompensating for something...?\nFilm Editors: Jade Hoffman\nMatt Allinson\nEd Knock\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe kids are all right. The title makes that clear.\nBut what about the adults? How is a lesbian\ncouple supposed to react when their children\nstart looking for their sperm donor? And what\nabout when they start bonding with him? When\nhe works his way into their seemingly normal\nfamily life? The adult protagonists of The Kids\nAre All Right are lesbians, but this theme is\nnever exploited. It\u2019s not necessarily about the\nlesbian marriage, it just centres on one. They\u2019re\na normal suburban family and Nic (Annette\nBening) and Jules (Julianne Moore) face the\nsame challenges that all married couples face.\nJoni, (Mia Wasikowska) their smart 18-year-old daughter, is the one who makes the call to\nthe biological dad, with her 15-year-old brother\nLaser\u2019s (Josh Hutcherson) persuasion. Their\nfather turns out to be Paul (Mark Ruffalo), an\neasy-going restaurant owner who says things\nlike \u201cyeah\u2026sure\u2026cool\u2026right on\u2026why not?\u201d\nThey meet (why not?), and of course, it\u2019s awk-ward. But when, Nic and Jules find out, Nic\n- the more controlling figure in the family - has\na difficult time coming to terms with this sudden revelation. Jules, the slightly unfocused\none, has a more relaxed attitude, and this automatically creates tension in their comfortable\nupper-middle class home.\nBening is superb here: whilst she stays away\nfrom portraying a total bitch, she is the protective mother bear trying to protect her family.\nShe speaks from the mind, whereas Moore,\nwho is just as excellent as her co-star, has a\nhigher level of tolerance and speaks from the\nheart. The two are immediately convincing as\nthe loving couple, now facing their marriage\nbeing put to the ultimate test.\nbut, as the film comes to a close \u2013 perhaps due\nto the film\u2019s title \u2013 Cholodenko seems to be a\nlot more interested in showing the clash between Jules and Nic. After all, it\u2019s the adults\nwe should be worried about, not the kids.\nWhat makes The Kids Are All Right so warm\nand witty is its script that cleverly balances\nboth comedy and drama. The intelligent dialogue gives us plenty of moments to laugh, but\nalso to reflect on the complex situation these\ncharacters have to face. The humour is never\ntoo gross or outrageous and the drama is never\ntoo sentimental or manipulative. Director/\nwriter Lisa Cholodenko knows not to take the\nfilm too seriously. With enough racy humour to\nthoroughly convince as an adult dramedy, but\nalso mixed with undeniably stirring moments\nthat the audience will be able to relate to, the\nfilm is a true exploration of what the term\n\u201cmodern family\u201d really is.\nFelix readers, we love you thiiiiiiiis much!\niCU Cinema - Scott Pilgrim vs. The\nWorld\n\u00a33/\u00a34 for members/non-members\nTue 9th Nov. 6:30pm.

If somebody wants to\ndabble with mind-altering substances in\ntheir free time, what\u2019s it to you?\nSure, people may be a \u2018menace\u2019 to\nthose around them when they\u2019re on such\nchemicals, but I fail how this differs to\nalcohol consumption, which seems to be\ndisregarded on grounds of our \u2018culture\u2019\n(whatever that means). How being sick,\ngetting into fights, having one-night\nstands, and forgetting about an evening\u2019s events can be seen as perfectly\nnormal behaviour is just beyond me.\nBesides, most people I know who\u2019ve\ndabbled with drugs don\u2019t become the\nraging arseholes most drinkers seem to\nmorph into on Wednesday sports nights,\nand instead just have a bit of a chat and\na boogie.\nSo let\u2019s imagine for a second a nation\nwhere the sale of narcotics is controlled\nby the state (refrain from the Orwellian\nutterances, please) or by private companies \u00e0 la Marlboro or Absolut. Quality\nwould have to be outstanding, and prices\ncompetitive \u2013 the illicit market would\nsoon cease to exist as it simply wouldn\u2019t\nbe able to compete. So now you have\nthe loss of a frankly scummy market,\nlower crime rates, and the people who\nwere getting high anyway are doing so\nin a safer environment with controlled\nsubstances.\nNobody would be encouraged to start\ntaking drugs due to their availability,\nand an adverse effect might even oc-cur. Sure, it\u2019s \u2018cool\u2019 to bang chemicals\nup your nose when it\u2019s illegal, but who\nwants to conform to something perfectly\nlegal? It\u2019d quickly lose the image of\nglamour that it currently has, that\u2019s for\nsure. So the people that were going to\nget high anyway will do so, and those\nwho want to give it a miss can do as they\nplease. Of course there would have to be\nregulation on who can buy what when,\nbut that\u2019s a separate argument altogether.\nWhat does prohibition actually\nachieve? An increase in the street value\nof the product, drawing people with no\naspirations to sell it for a quick buck. As\nmore people sell it (and make a killing)\nthe value drops. At this point, some of\nthe bigger players will be caught and\nbanged up \u2013 demand is still there, but\nsupply is low, so price increases. And\nso the cycle continues \u2013 a fluctuation of\nprices, a lot of dealers getting rich, and\nsome imprisoned.\nIt goes even further than that, though.\nMephedrone as a case in point: most\nBans don\u2019t work\nwebsites were selling \u2018good quality\u2019\nstuff that was what they said it was, at\naffordable prices, delivered faster than\na Dominos pizza. Following a bunch of\nhyped media coverage and an unnecessary ban, a bunch of people decide to set\nup websites of their own selling who-knows-what (if they actually deliver)\n\u2013 we now have a designer drugs market whereby people have no idea what\nthey\u2019re getting but will still take the risk.\nI\u2019m not saying that the story of your\nmother\u2019s brother twice removed isn\u2019t\nupsetting \u2013 I\u2019m sure it\u2019s devastating\nwhen you lose someone to drugs. The\npoint is that with some alterations to\nour legislation and culture around drugs\nthese kinds of horror stories probably\nwouldn\u2019t exist. Like sexual orienta-tion, race and religion, attitudes towards\ndrugs really need to be dragged from under the carpet and brought into the 21st\ncentury.\nOur out-dated attitude to drugs is doing more harm than\ngood. Legalising them is the most sensible solution\nIt is a truism that scientific research is\nan international affair. It relies on the free\nmovement of ideas and technology across\nland, sea and international borders. Most\nimportantly, it relies on the free movement\nof academics themselves.\nTherefore the government\u2019s plan to impose\na strict cap on immigration is disturbing for\nthe scientific community. Driven by the political need to assuage the widespread fear of\nimmigration, the coalition have come down\nhard on immigrants from non-EU countries.\nIn doing so, however, they have shot themselves in the foot, and the UK\u2019s scientific\ncommunity in the chest.\nA credible argument could be made (though\nthis newspaper wouldn\u2019t support it) about\nthe need to reduce immigration into the UK.\nBut conflating the large-scale immigration\nof unskilled workers from the world\u2019s dysfunctional states and movement of highly-skilled specialists in the global job market\nis short-sighted.\nTo add insult to injury, while the scientific\ncommunity is denied exemption from the\ndraconian immigration cap, Premiership\nfootball teams will be allowed to hire players\nfrom across the globe without restriction.\nWhen kicking a ball is deemed to be more\nimportant than the advancement of science,\nsomething is clearly amiss.\nAlready the government\u2019s distorted immigration policy is making the UK a less desirable\nplace for scientific research. Overseas applicants are forced to jump through a whole\nseries of bureaucratic hoops and at the end\nof the day, EU applicants are legally given\nprecedence. The new cap will mean that research groups will be further hampered by\nan inability to hire the brightest minds and\npostdoctoral researchers who require a visa\nextension could find themselves deported\nbefore their research is completed.\nResearch in the UK already excels in spite\nof poor funding and a lack of investment.\nOne wonders if the government is playing\na cruel game, increasing the burden just to\nsee how much the system can take. Their\nrecklessness is short-sighted and stupid.\nScientific research, and skilled employment\nin general, must be exempted from the immigration crackdown.\nFELIX\nBlack Sheep\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nThe Government\u2019s\nimmigration policy is\na threat to scientific\nresearch in the UK\nThe desks in the Felix office are getting a bit messy.

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX\n4\nIn brief\nShould Union profits pay for\nstudent bursaries?\nUnion President Alex Kendall\u2019s plans to consider using \u201ca proportion of the Union\u2019s commercial services\nprofits to fund bursaries\u201d received a mixed reception\nat this week\u2019s Union Council meeting. The money\nwould be given to the college to use as part of its\nbursary scheme in order to eliminate logistical difficulties in deciding which students should receive it,\nbut many were ideologically opposed to giving away\nUnion funds.\nThe opposition was lead by Deputy President for\nFinance and Services, Ravi Pall. It is his belief that\nthe money made by bars and shops should be reinvested in these same services, improving them for\nthe benefit of students.\nRCSU representatives were also worried that if\nthe Union gave away some of its money the College\nwould believe that it has a surplus, and therefore cut\nits \u00a31.2 million subsidy, which is completely separate from the commercial profits. Kendall stated that\nhe didn\u2019t believe that the College would take this\n\u201cimmoral\u201d course of action. He also dismissed Pall\u2019s\nclaims that the subsidy might be reduced in the\nfuture for other reasons, meaning that the profits\nwould be needed for running the union, as unlikely.\nMany were also concerned that giving Union money to just some violated the Union\u2019s mandate to\nhelp all. Supporters of the policy argued that a large\nproportion of students, (about 40 percent), would\nhave access to the bursaries, and that helping the\nneediest was clearly the right thing to do. There was,\nhowever, a lot of anxiety about the possibility of failing international students, who would be unable to\naccess many of the bursaries.\nPall\u2019s motion that this issue should not be discussed at further Council meetings as it would be a\nwaste of time was defeated by a large majority. The\nfinal decision on whether to support the bursaries,\nhowever, will be left until the College and government finalise their higher education funding policies.\nJudging by this week\u2019s events, the debate over that\ndecision is likely to be heated.\nMaciej Matuszewski\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMetric launch date announced\nUnsecured networks leave\nstudent data at risk\nbeing used, such as WPA, the captured packets\ncan be analysed effortlessly to derive the data\nwhich is being transmitted. This could equate\nto a Facebook status, a downloaded E-mail or\neven background information such as a cookie\nauthenticating the user to the website.\nThe problem lies here, as Felix tested this tool\naround various parts of the campus. FireSheep\nis a Firefox extension which appears as a sidebar in the popular Internet browser. The sidebar hides the complexities of packet inspection\nfrom the user and performs various tasks in\nthe background. It requires a packet capturing driver to be installed, called WinPCap, and\nusing this, it monitors all traffic visible to the\nmachine\u2019s network card (particularly packet\ndata corresponding to other users on the same\nwireless network) and attempts to hijack session cookies for websites.\nShould an unsuspecting user log in to one of\nthe listed services over the same network the\nhijacker is on, their picture and username will\nbe displayed in the sidebar and the hijacker can\ngain access to the service, fully authenticated\nas the person captured, by simply double clicking on the name in the sidebar.\nFelix was not able to successfully use the\ntool over the Imperial-WPA wireless network\non campus, since packets are encrypted with\nprotection, although this type of network is\nstill vulnerable to other types of attacks. The\nIC-DoC network, situated in the Department of\nComputing in the Huxley building, however, is\nunsecured. As a result, Felix was able to use\nthe tool to its full extent. Armed with an old\nlaptop with a network card that allowed capturing packets in \u2018promiscuous mode\u2019, where the\nuser has access to all packets visible to the card\n(some laptops protect against this), screenshots of private messages within Facebook ac-counts, phone numbers from \u2018numbers please\u2019\ngroups and other private information, Felix\napproached Computing\u2019s security team (CSG)\nand Imperial\u2019s ICT security for a response.\nRegarding the FireSheep tool, ICT commented that it is \u2018very interesting\u2019, and that \u2018unencrypted wireless networks have always been a\nsecurity issue, but they\u2019ve never been so high\nprofile\u2019, adding that \u2018the release of FireSheep\nmight generate enough publicity for home\nwireless users to think seriously about whether\nencryption is enabled on their home networks,\nand whether a wireless network is safe to connect to.\u2019\n\u2018ICT has always had security in mind when\ndesigning the College wireless service\u2019, they\nadded, \u2018we provide a number of different wireless networks to accommodate the huge range\nof devices which we support. It is planned that\nstaff and students in Computing will be migrated to use the main College wireless network\u2019,\nImperial-WPA.\nFelix interviewed two students from the Department of Computing who were affected by\nthis issue. Approached with information he expected was private, Josh Forman-Gornall said:\n\u2018I was surprised when I saw my account was accessible by anyone else. I expected the department would have measures to protect against\nthis\u2019, adding \u2018I think it\u2019s a travesty how they\nhave unprotected wireless. It should be WPA.\u2019\nUpon explaining the alternative of using the\nImperial-WPA network, Josh added \u2018I would\nuse it but the signal strength of IC-DoC is\nstronger so it\u2019s my first point of call. I have\ngood speed, but it seems I lose my privacy\nas a result.\u2019 Commenting on the tool itself, he\nsaid \u2018it\u2019s quite a scary prospect that the author\nhas made it so simple and put it out there. It\nmeans anyone can do it without knowing how\nit works. Pretty much everyone\u2019s bound to be\nusing that tool soon. It would wreak havoc, but\nI hope it doesn\u2019t get that far.\u2019\nFelix also approached Danish Khan with less\nof an emphasis on network security but more to\ndo with the websites\u2019 lack of SSL encryption,\nwho said \u2018if FireSheep worked regardless of\nnetwork security, I guess I\u2019d have to stop using\nthem or switch to a wired connection.\u2019 He added that \u2018Facebook and other sites could offer\nan HTTPS service which used SSL throughout,\nfor networks you don\u2019t trust, but you\u2019d expect\nto be able to trust DoC\u2019.\nDavid McBride, of the Computing Support\nGroup, responded to these comments in an\ninterview explaining that there will be a computational cost associated with services such\nas Facebook providing SSL throughout the\nsession, but that the problem is the underlying\nassumption of privacy in an otherwise unencrypted session on a website without SSL.\nHe explained that the IC-DoC network is\nunsecured to allow test devices, research machines and robots that are not compatible with\nencryption to connect to networked resources\nor be controlled over the wireless network.\nCoverage issues with the DoC network can\nbe investigated and fixed, but ultimately, for a\nreasonable expectation of security, the entire\nsession from the moment the website is visited\nmust be encrypted, not just the authentication\nand login.\n\u2018Don\u2019t panic\u2019, he added, explaining that the\nattack has existed for many years, and that users should associate with the Imperial-WPA\nnetwork for increased protection against this\ntype of attack. \u2018If in doubt, if the padlock isn\u2019t\nthere when you started using the website, it\nisn\u2019t safe\u2019.\nGoogle\u2019s Gmail service switched to SSL in\nJanuary this year, but services such as Facebook have yet to follow suit. Twitter currently\nprovides an SSL only option as a feature, and\nFelix advises users with doubts to both associate with the Imperial-WPA network where pos-sible. The attack, formally known as HTTP session hijacking, is an inherent problem with the\nway the websites are presented to the user and\nnot the fault of the wireless networks and their\nsecurity measures. Firefox extensions such as\nHTTPS-Everywhere and Force-TLS can be\nused to enable encryption where possible to\nthwart snoopers over a wireless network.\nFireSheep allows rather more subtle Facebook snooping than this\n...Continued from Front Page\nAfter a summer of construction work and successive\ndelays, the Union has finally set a date for the long-overdue launch of Metric.\nThe club will open on Saturday the 20th of November with a host of live bands and djs, including Robots in Disguise, Tape the Radio, Citadels and Missing Andy.\nThe new club, which replaces the old dBs, was\noriginally set to open at the beginning of October,\nin time for Welcome Week. However problems with\nremoving a pillar that would have blocked the stage\nmeant that this was pushed back to the 29th of October.\nUnfortunately the discovery of asbestos dashed\nUnion hopes of launching with a Halloween party.\nWith the success of the new bar, FiveSixEight, expectations are high for Metric.

Stories from\nthe veterans, of tarpaulins freeing themselves\nfrom the bus somewhere on the M1 and bags\nalmost being lost, didn\u2019t do much to hearten us\nfreshers, adding to the already present thoughts\nof why on earth did we agree to follow these\npeople just because they gave us free pizza?\nBut nonetheless we set out to the soothing\nchords of drum n\u2019 bass to conquer the great\npeaks of Snowdonia. Snowdon itself, at 1085\nmetres, loomed over us upon awakening at the\nhut the next morning. The thought of all the\nexcitement to come drew me from my bed at\n7.30 and I was presented with a bottle of gin as\na grand prize for being the most eager fresher.\nThat wonderful breakfast couldn\u2019t dampen my\nspirits for the day.\nWith the sun shining bright we packed our\nlunches and prepared \u2013 but there was a cloud\nin the sky. A plot to poison the trip was afoot!\nJames Allen had bought poison for our lunch I\ntell you! We were forced to fill our bags with\npackets of Tesco Value crisps. We almost rebelled at the horror of the situation \u2013 but we put\nour differences aside and kitted out. And a right\nbunch we were all dressed for our hike. Trainers were in show, boots lacking, and Simon had\neven turned up in a suit; though boots and gaiters for him finished off the snappy look.\nSo we set out in two groups; the mighty\nducks strong and true and the squashed bananas (named so by the mighty ducks) also ready\nfor the ascent. And a nice easy ascent it was\ntoo. Snowdon stands tall, yet we walked it in\na mere couple of hours, arriving at a suddenly\nvery cloudy summit after hours of sunshine.\nThe second group arrived in blinding sunshine\nand could see from the sea to inland plains. Bananas have all the luck!\nAfter a first lunch on the slopes accompanied\nby a lovely cup of coffee, brewed at three and\na half thousand feet by yours truly, we stopped\nfor a quick snap on chancing on the other\ngroup, and continued a leisurely stroll back\ndown the mountain; stopping frequently for\nmore lunches. When the crisps are absolutely\ntasteless you need to eat more of them to feel\naccomplished.\nThe incredibly speedy and absolutely problem free trip left us with a concern level of\nmerely 1, and hours to kill in the pub. Joe arrived back from Snowdon with a tablet of stone\nand soon the commandments rained down\nupon us. Our copious drinking was undertaken\non pain of punishment from THE TABLET.\nReturning to the hut for Jim and Peter\u2019s vegetarian curry (with added chicken) we found\nhalf our number had been massacred by vicious weresheep (baaa-arrrrooo!). Even Fran\u2019s\nmagical Bells potion and the warming power of\nHong Thong - Willy Wonka\u2019s own speciality \u2013\ncouldn\u2019t save us. Only Natasha and Wan Ting\nwere left standing. Maybe their love of microwaves helped save them from the weresheep.\nWith fire blazing, shisha smoking and whisky\ndrowned cake we were dropping like flies;\nMatt already having left us after his three pints\nat the pub. Creating our own Hong Thong from\nBells, curry and other ingredients I don\u2019t want\nto know about finished us off for the night.\nBy the next morning we still hadn\u2019t decided\non what to hike that day. Not until we were half\nway up a cliff face and found out we couldn\u2019t\nturn back did we decide that that was our walk\nfor the day. So bags filled with Value crisps and\nleftover curry sandwiches we stopped being\nFellwanderers and became mountaineers. The\nidea of a Sunday walk of course being a nice\ngentle walk to cool off the weekend became a\ncrawl on all fours to the peak of Tryfan at 918\nmetres. Tensions rose. Rafal became steadily\nmore annoyed, and he passed through all of\nhis possible facial expressions within seconds.\nFinally reaching the peak we stopped off for a\nquick lunch and then the mighty ducks raced\nthe descending ominous clouds to the base,\nloosing James Allen on the way who insisted\non following his map.

    "content": "POLITICS\nFELIX 13\nThe Imperial College of North Korea\nJames Lees\nUN calls in Rector in India-Pakistan dispute\nHosepipe bans cause outrage in middle\nEngland, but some water disputes go\nmuch deeper than the need to ensure your\nlawn is greener than the Jones\u2019, and when\nthere is an issue between India and Pakistan the world needs to pay attention. The\nKishenganga tributary in the disputed\nJammu and Kashmir region is currently\nthe source of an argument between India\nand Pakistan over Indian plans to build a\n300MW hydroelectric plant.\nAfter the dispute could not be resolved\nat a governmental level, Pakistan has decided it needs to be settled by a specially\nformed International Court of Arbitration (ICA). This is how any problems\nover water in the region are to be settled\nas laid out in the Indus Waters treaty of\n1960. The UN Secretary General, Ban\nKi-moon, has appointed Judge Stephen\nM. Schwebel, former President of the\nInternational Court of Justice to head\nthe ICA. India and Pakistan have each\nappointed 2 legal experts to represent\nthemselves. The final 2 members of the\n7 member ICA will be appointed by\nLord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice of\nEngland and Wales who will choose a\nneutral legal expert, and Imperial\u2019s own\nRector, Keith O\u2019Nions who will choose\nan engineer.\nIt is the ICA\u2019s task to settle the dispute\nover whether India has the right to build\nthe dam. The process of making the dam\nwill result in diverting the Kishenganga,\nsomething which India believes it is allowed to do under the terms of the treaty.\nPakistan objects for a number of reasons,\nfirstly doing this will result in disruption\nof the water flow at its own NeelamJhelum project further downstream.\nPakistan claims this \u201cbreaches India\u2019s\nlegal obligations under the treaty\u201d. A further objection relates to India\u2019s decision\nto lower the level of the reservoir at the\nplant which Pakistan believes breaks the\nrules on the drawdown of water.\nThe Indus Waters treaty gives India the\nright to create 3.6 million acre feet of water storage capacity and it is apparently\nnot in danger of exceeding this. Environmentalists have claimed that the construction of the dam will wreck the habitats of local endangered animals such as\nthe snow leopard and the barking deer.\nDisputes over anything between these\ntwo nuclear nations need to be resolved\ncarefully and the ICA has a difficult task\nahead of it if a fair solution is to be found\nwhich avoids either side losing face. It\nis likely many hours of sitting in rooms\nwith arguing lawyers await whichever\nengineer the Rector eventually chooses.\nThe British delegation and teaching staff at the P.U.S.T.\nJames Chin Kyung Kim is that rare man\n\u2013 a man who believes in the unbeliev-able, and makes it happen.\nRemarkable also, because he once languished in a North Korean prison cell.\nRemarkable, because this self-made\nman has used his own resources to back\nhis beliefs with hard cash.\nDuring my recent third visit to North\nKorea I was privileged to visit the campus of Dr.Kim\u2019s brand new Pyongyang\nUniversity of Science and Technology\n(PUST) \u2013 just a day before it formally\nopened for business.\nLike its founder, PUST is remarkable,\nbecause in a country notorious for the\nrigid control exercised by the State, this\nis the country\u2019s first privately funded\ninternational institution, with a cohort\nof academic staff drawn from Europe,\nChina and North America, openly promoting a strategy for enabling North\nKorea\u2019s citizens to engage successfully\nin the world economy and global soci-ety.\nPUST is a complex of brand new\nbuildings situated on 248 acres of land\nin southern Pyongyang\u2019s Rakrang dis-trict. The well-appointed campus has\na target enrolment of 600 graduate and\n2000 undergraduate students by 2012\nThis academic year it began courses in\nthree faculties: information technology;\nindustry and management; and a faculty\nfor agriculture, food and life sciences.\nTwo more will follow: architecture and\nengineering; and public health.\nPUST\u2019s development plan includes\na research and design capability, the\ncreation of a Pyongyang Techno-park\nto incubate inventions and ideas, and\na straight-forward repudiation of what\nJames Kim calls \u201cmass production education.\u201d PUST is helping to prepare tomorrow\u2019s Korean leaders for the world\nin which they will live : generation next.\nWhat Kim and his university represent should not in any way be under-estimated. They are symbolic of the\nincremental change which the country\u2019s\nleaders recently promulgated \u2013 change\nwhich places the characteristics of \u201ca\nprosperous future\u201d and \u201ca dignified future\u201d before military might. North Korea is gradually accepting that neither\nits neighbours nor western nations have\nterritorial ambitions against it and that\nthe maintenance of the worlds\u2019 fourth\nlargest army \u2013 one million men under\narms \u2013 and the development of weapons\nof mass destruction \u2013 have drained away\nprecious resources which could have\nbeen better used on economic and social\ndevelopment.\nIts military leaders know that if it ever\nused its arsenal there would be a deadly\nand cataclysmic repetition of the Korean\nWar which claimed an estimated 3 million lives.\nIn this, the sixtieth year since those\nlethal hostilities commenced, there remains in place a threadbare armistice.\nIn the intervening six decades there has\nbeen neither peace nor war, merely this\nstop-gap armistice which flares up from\ntime to time into dangerous and deadly\nacts of provocation, the most recent of\nwhich were the sinking of the South Korean naval vessel, the Cheonan, resulting\nin the loss of 46 Korean lives; and some\nsabre-rattling shots fired across the border just a few hours after we left\nDuring my three visits to North Korea\nwith my colleague, Baroness (Caroline)\nCox we have consistently urged its leaders to find a peaceful way forward whilst\nalso documenting and raising examples\nof egregious violations of human rights\n- and urging economic, social, humanitarian and political reforms.\nIn 2003, at Panmunjom, on the 38th\nparallel which divides north from\nsouth, and where the 1953 Armistice\nwas signed, I wrote in the visitors book\nthat it is \u201cbetter for men to build bridges\nthan to build walls.\u201d\nSince then we have both quietly persisted with constructive, critical engage-ment, mindful of the old Korean proverb\nthat \u201cto begin is to half complete the\ntask.\u201d\nIn 2009 we published our report\n\u201cCarpe Diem\u201d, which urged the incoming Obama Administration seize\nboth the moment and the initiative. The\nWhite House missed the chance to announce the formal ending of the war and\nthe creation of diplomatic presence in\nPyongyang.\nThroughout the Cold War, the U.S. had\na comparable presence in Soviet Union\nand its satellites, and also in China \u2013\nallowing it to pursue the Helsinki process of human rights engagement and\nto see both economic liberalisation and\npolitical reform. But, like the Bourbons,\nwe seem to have learnt nothing, failing\nto pursue \u201cHelsinki with a Korean face.\u201d\nBritain, to its credit, has had an Ambassador and embassy in Pyongyang\nsince 2000 \u2013 and this has enhanced our\nability to engage the country\u2019s leadership and to influence its future. Ambassador Peter Hughes is widely admired\nfor his thoughtful diplomacy and his\nrefusal to give up on finding a peaceful\nway forward.\nIgnoring North Korea is not an option.\nWe need a variety of confidence\nbuilding measures which painstakingly\nand patiently help North Korea to take\nits place as a welcome member of the\nworld community \u2013 and Pyongyang\u2019s\nUniversity of Science and Technology is\na welcome harbinger of what that world\nmight look like.\nJames Kim\u2019s story should not obscure the magnitude of the challenge or\nthe unique difficulties of operating in a\ncountry which because of its oddities\nand enormities can all too easily become\na copy writer\u2019s dream. But his is a story\nwhich inspires and encourages.\nAt the outbreak of the Korean War\nDr.Kim was just 15 years-old. Nevertheless, he enlisted and fought against the\ncommunist north. Of 800 men in his unit\nhe told me that just 17 survived.\nWithout money, after the war, he travelled first to France, landing in Marseille,\nand then on to Switzerland and, in 1960,\nto Britain, where he studied at Bristol\u2019s\nClifton Theological College. He later\nreturned to Seoul and, in 1976, began a\nseries of business enertprises in Florida.\nBut he never forgot his vow and, in the\n1980s he sold up, created a university\ncollege in South Korea and in 1992 was\nready to export his model of education to China. Yanmbian University of\nScience of Technology, in Yanji, north\neastern China, was the result. It, in turn,\nbecame the model for Pyongyang.\nBut, before that could happen, Dr.Kim\nwould be arrested by Kim Jong Il\u2019s\nNorth Korean Government and languish\nin jail.\nNext week David Alton describes how\nDr.Kim unlocked both the door to his\ncell and a political system - opening\nthe way to North Korea\u2019s first private\ninternational university.\nDavid Alton\nIn the first of three Felix articles, Lord David Alton of Liverpool reports on his visit\nto the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology\nFriday 05 November 2010\n\n"

    "content": "WERE THE FRENCH\nRIGHT TO\nSTRIKE?\nY\nawn yawn, the\nFrench are on\nstrike again, and I\nand others are left\nwondering what\nthe point is. This time at least, it\nappears to be some sort of prin-ciple, though whether this raises\nthem above the level of London\nUnderground tube drivers striking\nis questionable. The majority of the people they inconvenience either\nearn half what they do, or work for twice as many hours in a day \u2013 generally both.\nHowever, I cannot help but think the strikers in France have got it\nwrong too, and for several reasons. For one, several affluent Frenchmen\n(and women) known to me have described the French predilection for\nstriking as the \u2018national sport\u2019. This hardly imbues it with a moral worthiness the strikers might wish for. But even more than that, the princi-ple, which it doubtless is, over which they are striking now is seemingly\nimpossible to rationalise. They do not like the age of compulsory retirement being raised from 60 to 62 years. This seems rather spoilt when\none considers that in both the UK and in Germany, the age of compulsory\nretirement is 65, and will rise in both countries, probably to 67 or 68.\nThere is little resistance to this in Britain, one imagines for a variety of\nreasons. No one has any money and so it is understood that we all need\nto work for longer. What many may not have considered is the fact that\nwhen the current system of state pensions was designed, the expectation\nwas a retirement of only a few years after the age of 65. The fiscal comparison of this with today\u2019s retirements of twenty or even thirty years,\nhas not been widely reported. Perhaps more importantly, a compulsory\nretirement of almost any age seems a form of ageism. Whole sitcoms\nhave been written about the subject (Waiting for God; The Legacy of\nReggie Perrin), in which experienced, well-trained personnel at the top\nof their games are \u2018retired\u2019. They call it being \u2018thrown on the scrapheap\u2019.\nSecond, striking does not seem to fit with the principles it means to in\nFrance. This rather French off-centre attitude goes back a long way\u2014the\nfirst clear example being that beheading the aristocracy was as recondite\nto egalitarianism as any of the current activity is. Mme. Guillotine did\nnothing to equalise people. If anything she served to mark the unsatisfactory delineation as clearly in death as it was in life.\nThe British have an innate distrust of their politicians, the French seem\nto have an innate belief that theirs are criminal. Many turn out to be so,\nbut that does not seem to make the French electorate change that. So instead of complaining-by-inconveniencing, what about making a rational\nanalysis of the effect on the lives of everyone?\n16 felix\nFRIDAY 5 november 2010\nCOMMENT\nComment Editor: Anna Perman\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nE\nver since the 14th July\n1789, the French have\nconsistently displayed\na fair amount of je\nne sais quoi when it\ncomes to acts of rebellion. The\nStorming of the Bastille cemented\nFrance\u2019s reputation, in the words of\nFran\u00e7ois Mignet, as a nation \u201cintoxicated with liberty and enthusiasm.\u201d\nCloser to most French hearts, however, are the riots of May 1968.\nWhat started as a piddling group of grumbling students soon exceeded\n20,000 people. Within less than a week, over a million people were\nmarching through Paris in their support. You blinked your eyelids and\nthe number had become ten million! President Charles de Gaulle\nfled the country, calling for new parliamentary elections to calm the rising violence and avoid civil war. A bunch of adolescents had very nearly\ncaused the collapse of the government. And none of this had been driven\nby the unions.\nEver since 1968, France has become a more liberal place, with less\nrespect for authority and a steadfast desire to place quality of life at\nthe centre of all social reform. In 1983, President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\nbrought in the right to retire at 60, and in 2000 Prime Minister Lionel\nJospin helped instigate the 35-hour working week. But this social trend\nis under threat from a bill to make people work two more years for their\npensions. A bill that is being rushed through the upper house using a\nhighly contentious emergency constitutional measure.\nThe public are out in force once again, living up to their strong striking and demonstrating pedigree. Current President Nicolas Sarkozy is\nin essence a wannabe JFK, and likes to portray a Hollywood persona.\nHe is the least popular leader in the history of the Fifth Republic, and\nis at odds with two-thirds of the French citizens that he represents who\noppose the pension law. He has been accused of ignoring the public and\ncomes across as a tetchy authoritarian, arrogant president. How their\nFrench howls of protest put to shame our British whimpers against the\ndraconian cuts we are facing.\nThe French government seems to only listen to public opinion when\nunder serious pressure to do so. It\u2019s almost as if the whole political\nsystem is centered on striking. The government appears to deliberately\nwait for a strike before considering any negotiations, whatever the issue.\nThe people are correct to express their democratic right to strike, regardless of the financial impact of the reforms. They adamantly believe in a\nsocial way of life that has taken countless battles, fought by their parents\nand grand-parents, to achieve. They are being true to their principles and\nculture, putting us don\u2019t-you-mind-if-you-don\u2019t Brits to shame.\n\u201cThe French\npredilection for\nstriking is the\n\u2018national sport\u2019\u201d\nSamuel Furse\n\u201cFrench howls\nof protest put to\nshame our British\nwhimpers\u201d\nPumpkins? Evil?\nTopless torsos? Odd...\nHalloween sucks.\nCharles Betts\nHalloween bugs me, so this year I thought\nI\u2019d ignore it altogether. I\u2019m not the kind of\nperson who will set out logical arguments\nfor this, but not because I\u2019m lazy. I just don\u2019t\nhave that desperate a need for your approv-al. However I would really like to talk about\nmy fear of Pumpkins. I realise that as a type\nof vegetable (or is it fruit? I\u2019m not going to\nlook it up because I don\u2019t care), Pumpkin\nshould not have a capital but I have a prob-lem. I don\u2019t like to backspace. So I don\u2019t\ncare if I typo, I ain\u2019t going back.\nSo there\u2019s the Pumpkin sitting pretty (or\nugly if the mother let her fat little son handle the knife) flickering in the window mocking me. I\u2019m not paranoid, the damn things\nare actually evil and hate me and want to\nkill me and STUFF. We used to be friends,\nPumpkins and I, we used to braid one another\u2019s hair etc. And then the love was gone,\njust like David Guetta says. On a side note\nbefore I continue about Pumpkins, I hear\nsome men dressed for Halloween parties as\nwerewolves from Twilight, i.e. topless teenage \u201ctottie\u201d. I only write \u201ctottie\u201d for the al-literation, I actually hate the word, plus no\ntopless guy at a party really attracts anyone\nbecause having your torso out when it\u2019s not\ncold is a rather effeminate look.\nBack to Pumpkins (which, incidentally,\nwould make a great girls\u2019 name). I would\nlike to crush Pumpkins further by pointing\nout that they aren\u2019t even remotely spooky. In\nfact, things that attempt to be spooky rarely\nare. A cemetery at night, is that spooky?\nWell yes, in a way. But only in the same way\nmany deserted places are spooky at night;\nit\u2019s not that there is a chance of someone\nrising from the dead, it\u2019s the presence of\nundesirables such as muggers. Something\nthat does intrigue me is masks. In the Halloween films, the fact that you can\u2019t see Michael Myers\u2019 face definitely adds to the fear.\nI get genuinely scared watching those films.\nPeople in masks at Halloween aren\u2019t scary\nexcept when you actually have no idea who\u2019s\nunder it and they don\u2019t speak and keep staring at you from a distance. But that tends\nnot to happen at parties.\nDamn, how am I going to sleep tonight\nnow that I\u2019ve reminded myself of those\nHalloween films!

    "content": "A R T S\nFELIX\n18\nArts Editor: Rox Middleton\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWhen a writer writes to tell the truth, it can have\ndangerous and disturbing effects. Roberto\u2019s book\nGomorrah on the Neapolitan Camorra crime sys-tem, published in 2006, made him a bestselling\nauthor. However, it also gave him the perennial\ncompany of five armed guards. Why does a writer\nhave an escort? The question could be easily answered by pointing out that Saviano\u2019s book exposes\nthe activities and economic system of the Camorra,\nthe criminal organization originally from Naples that\nnow does business all over the world. This has certainly upset the camorristi who now threaten Saviano\u2019s life.\nIf you read nothing else\nthis week...\nEduardo Borgomeo\u2019s choice of a\nmodern Italian epic will open your\neyes to one of the most important\nbooks of the last five years.\nGomorrah by\nRoberto Saviano\nWant the world to know about your favourite read?\nIf you want to see it in Felix send 300-400 words to\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHelen Mackey\nFrom classical \u2018safari\u2019 style photos that bring\ndrama on a big scale, to atmospheric artistic\nblack and white studies and colourful conceptual pieces, this exhibition has rightly earned\nitself a popular following as an internationally\nrenowned exhibition bringing together some of\nthe best wildlife photography of the last year. I\nreally only became aware of its existence last\nyear and sadly, that attention was due to in-famy. In 2009 there was scandal; shortly after\nJos\u00e9 Luis Rodriguez\u2019s \u2018Storybook Wolf\u2019 was\nannounced as the overall winner of the prestigious award, gossip began circulating that not\nall was as it seemed. Following thorough investigations it emerged that, contrary to what\nRodriguez had portrayed in his submitted cap-tion, his photo was not a chance encounter with\na wild wolf, capturing distinct natural behav-iour. Instead, he effectively cheated by using\na tame wolf trained to perform for the camera.\nFor the first time in 46 years, there was a blank\nspace on the exhibition wall as the photograph\nwas removed and Rodriquez\u2019 title revoked.\nThis year captive animals were banned from\nthe competition altogether. As was Rodriguez,\nincidentally. Harsh. But strict enforcement of\nsuch rules is essential to this exhibition and its\npurpose. In an age when every image we see is\nmanipulated to such a degree that we question\nwhat, if anything present, constitutes reality;\nit\u2019s refreshing to look upon photographs that\ncapture the very concept of magnificence of the\nuntouched. Wildlife is, after all, most incredible without our interference.\nWhen I visited, it was clear that that message\nof conservation is at the heart of the exhibition.\nBut I was pleased that they managed to put\ntheir point across in a way that doesn\u2019t overwhelm what remains a celebration of the stunning work on display. There are specific categories whose photos plainly aim to illustrate\nthe current destruction of wildlife worldwide\n(including the newly introduced \u2018Photojournalist\u2019 award, whose winner this year reported on\nanimal cruelty in Asia), however in general the\npoint is made in a more positive way; by showing us how much we have, it implies how much\nwe have to lose.\nHowever what impressed me most was the\ndedication the entrants possessed. Beneath every photograph is a list of the equipment used\nto take the shot, one or two sentences about\nThe art of shooting wildlife\nthe creature or its habitat and a caption written by the entrant. It was whilst reading these\ncaptions (some authored by 10yr olds entering\nthe children\u2019s category, which was, gallingly,\nno less impressive in standard) that I realised\nthe photographs on display were not really the\nproduct of any expensive or elaborate equipment but, more truthfully, the product of endless patience in often inhospitable conditions,\nall for the chance of that one magical shot. You\nwill undoubtedly agree, if you take time to visit\nthe exhibition, the end result confirms that their\nperseverance to wait for that real, truly wild\nanimal is absolutely worth it.\nA marvel of ants, Bence M\u00e1t\u00e9. Veolia Environnement Wildlife Photographer of the Year - Overall Winner\nHowever, many writers and journalists have talked\nabout the mafia systems before, so the fact that\nSaviano is writing about the mafia is not the only\nreason why he is a marked man. Saviano\u2019s work\nhas been perceived as a threat to the criminal organization because it broke through the walls of\nsilence and indifference. Gomorrah turned the attention of a whole nation, and not just of a few local newspapers, on the practices, connections and\nbusinesses of the criminal system. It is the number\nof readers, and thus the success of the book, that\nhas made Gomorrah and its author dangerous. The\nfact that Gomorrah sold 10 million copies means\nthat 10 million people know. They know the names\nof the mafia bosses. They know that the camorristi\nfilled entire provinces with toxic waste. They know\nthat the existences of the godfathers are miserable\nand wretched, and not incredible as the Hollywood\nmythology made us think.\nYet it is unclear why a writer should deal with the\nmafia. I mean, usually dealing with the crime system is the task of judges and policemen. What does\nliterature have to do with the mafia? To answer this\nquestion we need to consider what the mafia really\nis. The mafia is not just an association of gangsters.\nIt is a frame of mind, a way of thinking, a system of\nrelationships that covers every aspect of life. Thus\nin order to fight it off and defeat it, what is needed\nis a cultural movement and not just police action. In\nthis scenario works such as Gomorrah are of fundamental importance because they spread the word,\nthey spread the knowledge so that a story that used\nto be the story of a single town or area is now the\nstory of 10 million people. This is the power of liter-ature, the power of making a distant story the story\nof everyone. A story that you can\u2019t ignore.\nThe Veolia Environment Wildlife Photographer of the Year at the Natural History Museum till March. Students \u00a34.50.\nThe Frozen Moment, Fergus Gill.

Deciding that\nmotorways were boring we took theA303/A30,\nwhereby we had to resist the urge of stopping\nto buy strawberries from the stalls cunningly\npositioned every 50m along the road. After a\nquick stop for lunch we knew we were getting\nclose when Pirate FM appeared on the radio,\nand we were soon greeted at the campsite by\nwhat seemed like a completely sane campsite\nowner (a what??!) before speedily heading off\nto the shops to buy some food. By the time we\ngot back Icy (our RIB) had arrived and our tent\nvillage for the week was taking shape. Sadly it\nturned out that the boats steering was broken\nand we would need to get some new bolts.\nWith no boat to use, Sunday saw us heading\nto Lamorna Cove to do a couple of shore dives.\nThose people who didn\u2019t listen to Olle\u2019s advice and headed around the harbour wall found\nsome interesting things, while those of us who\ndid found sand. And rocks. With the day\u2019s diving over we headed off to find some screws to\nfix Icy. With Icy now fixed Monday was going\nto be much more interesting. Launching from\nHayle, Ben gently lowered the boat down the\nincredibly steep slip and armed with 4 different\ncoordinates for the St Chamond we headed out\neager to see what awaited us. Turns out it was\n4m swell. Having gone through all that we had\nhowever, we were not going to let that put us\noff and so in went the shot and down went the\ndivers. Sadly we picked the wrong coordinates\nand only Olle\u2019s group found the trains. Having\nmade most people chuck their breakfast over\nthe side of the boat, we decided not to pursue a\nsecond dive as it was already 3pm.\nTuesday saw our first trip out from Penzance,\nalthough we didn\u2019t see much due to a thick\nlayer of fog. The original plan was to dive the\nHellopes, but it was too deep for the inexperienced sporties onboard. For the rest of us it was\nonto the Lowlee Ledges / Primrose which had\na nice nature trail rope to follow, and then onto\nwhat we later discovered was the very broken\nup wreck of the Ansgir. On Tuesday evening\nwhile venturing in to collect our filled tanks for\nthe next day, the crazy man showed us his compressor room. He had about 5/6 compressors\nlinked by a network of pipes that would look\nfitting on a submarine, and they were powered\nby a generator from an old telephone exchange\nthat could rival Battersea power station!\nOn Thursday we decided that due to the nice\nweather we would attempt to go for the Runnelstone. After a long journey we decided to\nignore the 3-4m swell and dropped down to be\ngreeted by huge boulders completely covered\nin jewel-anemones.\nWe decided to go for the Hellopes again on\nFriday. With Simon\u2019s twinset broken, he and I\ndecided to make the most of our dive and made\nour way down to 35m in 2 minutes by climbing\ndown the shot line! This gave us plenty of time\nto explore the wreck where we found the rudder and prop still intact and 2 massive boilers\nwith lots of pipes running all over the place.\nWith the departure of Danielle, Tom and John\non Friday there were only 7 of us in the boat on\nSaturday and so we loaded up 2 cylinders each,\npacked our lunch and headed off on the 15 mile\njourney to Wolfrock. This was a fantastic dive\nwith a very steep wall covered in jewel-anem-ones and teeming with all sorts of life. After\nheading back to a nearby cove for some lunch\nwe set out once again to go to Longships where\nOlle and Richard swam around trying to find\nsome seals. All in all, a great week.\nThere are still be places on our training\ncourses for this year, email scuba@ic.ac.\nuk if you are interested.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 05 November 2010 3\nPhoto by David Robertson\nNEWS\nProf Nutt: alcohol\nworse than heroin\nCouncil backs fees rise\nThis week Imperial College Union\nCouncil accepted Union President Alex\nKendall\u2019s Higher Education Funding\nPolicy paper. The paper broadly supported the Browne Review, with Kendall warning against \u201creactionary\u201d\nbehaviour similar to that of the NUS,\nsuggesting that students should be prepared to \u201cwork with universities, not\nagainst them\u201d.\nThe Council did, however, recognise\nsome problems with Browne\u2019s report.\nKendall specifically thought that \u201cpostgraduate students should be included in\na government spending review\u201d.\nMuch was also said about the psychological impact of greatly increased fees\non poorer students. Kendall argued that\n\u201cwhat matters is what you\u2019ll actually\npay, not the maximum possible fees\u201d,\npointing out that under Browne\u2019s proposals the amount students pay will be\ntied to their income, which will be especially helpful to those who wish to go\ninto \u201csocially useful\u201d but low paid jobs\nsuch as teaching. Indeed it is estimated\nthat more than 30 percent of people will\nnever have to pay back the full amount\nthey owe. He did, however, agree that\nmany potential students are not aware\nof this, and that there is \u201cnot enough\ninformation about bursaries\u201d and other\nmeans of support. The Council agreed\nthat \u201cgetting information to schools\u201d\nshould be one of Union\u2019s and Imperial\u2019s biggest priorities. It also agreed to\nUnion Council passes policy supporting\nBrowne Review, including uncapped fees\ncampaign for students\u2019 means to be calculated based on family size as well as\ntotal income, to help \u2018medium income\u2019\nfamilies from which many children go\nto university.\nThe discussion then turned to the possibility that better universities, such as\nImperial, might charge more for degrees than less academically accomplished ones. Several council members\nargued that universities are not purely\ncapitalistic systems, and that increasing\nfees would not lower student numbers,\n(which might be a disincentive), but\nsimply increase the proportion of richer\nstudents. It was, however, pointed out\nthat if Imperial was to gain a reputation for attracting mainly rich students,\nthe loss of highly able but less well off\nstudents, would in itself act as a disin-centive. Browne\u2019s suggested levy on\nuniversities charging excessive fees was\nalso mentioned as a reason why Imperial\u2019s fees would not become unreason-able. The general consensus was that\nwhile we must \u201caccept different rates for\ndifferent universities\u201d, these differences\nwill not be as great as feared.\nThe impact on EU students, however,\nwas recognised to be possibly greater\nthan on UK students, because they have\nless access to support. Imperial\u2019s increasing fees might drive them to cheaper UK\nuniversities, or universities in their own\ncountries (where higher education is often free), causing the College to lose its\nreputation as an \u201cinternational university\u201d. Kendall, however, rebutted that\n\u201cImperial runs on reputation more than\nmoney\u201d and that increased fees would\nbe invested in improving this reputation,\ntherefore maintaining student numbers.\nThe higher education funding situation was ambiguous at the time of the\ndebate, so Council was very clear to\nstate that by accepting Kendall\u2019s paper it\nwas not setting a permanent Union funding strategy. Amendments to its policies\nare likely after the government finalises\nits plans (see below).\nMaciej Matuszewski\nGovernment keeps fees cap\nThe UK coalition government has rejected the Browne Review\u2019s proposal\nof unlimited tuition fees in favour of a\n\u00a39,000 cap.\nIn an announcement on Wednesday,\nthe proposal of a free market for tuition\nfees was rejected as it was seen to be unsustainable and expensive. The government was compelled to come to a final\ndecision that would be quick to implement so that it would be in place for fees\nin 2012. Raising the tuition fee cap will\nnot require a change in legislation, so\ncan be put into place quickly.\nMany universities feel that this\namount is necessary to cover the costs\nof financing education, especially after\nthe government cuts of 40% to teaching\nfunds and a complete cut to funding in\nhumanities. The higher fees will enable\nuniversities to supply more bursaries, so\nshould not dissuade prospective students\nfrom going to university. However,\nthere are fears that students will be put\noff by the estimated \u00a340,000 debt caused\nby a three year degree course. Although\nthe repayment threshold will be raised\nfrom \u00a315,000 to \u00a321,000 per year with\na 9% repayment rate, graduates may\nspend 30 years paying off their debt before it is cancelled.\nThe Liberal Democrats, who initially\npledged to have no fees at all, proposed\na cap of \u00a37000, however as some universities saw this to be inadequate and\nthreatened to privatise, a maximum fee\nof \u00a39000 was agreed. Universities who\nwish to charge this fee will have to make\na \u2018public benefit\u2019 by taking more students from disadvantaged backgrounds,\nbut its implication that university application will now be based on means as\nwell as merit is controversial.\nThe announcement was officially\nmade to the House of Commons by\nDavid Willetts, the Universities and\nScience Minister, who said that the proposal \u201cwill put universities\u2019 finance on\na sustainable footing with extra freedoms and less bureaucracy\u201d. Aaron Porter, President of the National Union of\nStudents, feels that the proposal will be\n\u201csaddling a generation with huge debts\nbefore they have even got on their bikes\nto find work.\u201d The NUS are opposed\nto any rise in fees and will be holding\na protest in Central London on Wednesday the 10th.\nImperial professor and former government adviser David Nutt has pitted himself against current drugs classification\nonce again by claiming that alcohol is\nmore harmful than various illegal substances in a newly released report.\nThe study, published in peer-reviewed\nmedical journal The Lancet, was coauthored by Professor Nutt and provides\na list of 20 drugs ranked with respect to\ntheir harm, both personal and to society\nin general. A wide range of topics were\ninvestigated, including the risk of addiction and crime. Findings revealed that\nheroin, crack and methamphetamine\nwere the most harmful drugs to an individual while alcohol, heroin and crack\nwere most harmful to others. However\ntaking both factors into account revealed\nthat alcohol was the most harmful drug\noverall. The report goes on to argue\nagainst current drug classifications,\nclaiming that they \u201chave little relation\u201d\nto the evidence of their actual harm.\nThis is not the first time Professor\nNutt has contradicted current government drugs legislation. He caused some\ncontroversy amongst government ministers in February 2009 when the Home\nOffice body that he chaired suggested\ndowngrading ecstasy from a class A to a\nclass B drug. This followed a comparison between the risks of using the drug\nto those associated with horse riding.\nHe was then sacked from his position as\nchief drugs adviser in October 2009, by\nthen Home SecretaryAlan Johnson, after\nsuggesting, in a similar fashion to the latest report, that alcohol and tobacco were\nmore harmful than many illegal drugs.\nFollowing his dismissal, Professor\nNutt sought to continue his research\nunhindered by governmental influence,\nforming the Independent Scientific\nCommittee on Drugs which seeks to offer \u2018impartial objective information on\ndrugs and drug harms to the public\u2019 but\n\u2018free from political pressures\u2019.\nAt the time of his dismissal last year,\nProfessor Nutt was highly critical of\npoliticians who he accused of misrepresenting research in order to manipulate\ndrugs legislation. When asked whether\nhe believed that the new coalition government would be more accepting of the\nlatest findings, especially after the recent\ngovernment budget freeze for science,\nProfessor Nutt, speaking to Felix, said,\n\u201cI think so. The Liberal Democrats have\nalways wanted independent scientific advice on drugs\u201d before adding that, \u201cthe\nTories are more drug-experienced than\nold Labour\u201d.\nClaims against the findings have been\nmade to the BBC by a spokesman for\nthe Wine and Spirit Trade Association,\nwho argues that, \u201cProfessor Nutt and\nhis colleagues risk switching people off\nfrom considering the real issues and the\nreal action that is needed to tackle alcohol misuse\u201d. In response to this, Professor Nutt told Felix that the association is\n\u201crunning scared. They can\u2019t argue with\nthe science so they are trying deflection.\u201d\nWhen asked about the report itself and\nhow the ready availability of alcohol\nwas taken into account and what effect\nthis had on social harm, Professor Nutt\nstated that, \u201cmost of the harms to others\nare affected by availability\u201d.\nThis debate arrives as Imperial College Union launches a new website,\nyourlimits.co.uk, that seeks to advise\nstudents on the potential risks associated\nwith drug and alcohol use. Ravi Pall,\nDeputy President (Finance & Services)\nexplained to Felix the reasoning behind\nthe creation of the website: \u201cWe created\nthe Limits website as an additional tool\nto raise the awareness of potential situations students may encounter.\u201d\n\u201cWe see this being particularly useful for new students, who may not have\nbeen exposed to the culture created by\nothers. It provides helpful advice for stu-dents, and will be heavily tied into the\nmarketing for our new night-club, bars\nand ents program.\u201d\nIt remains to be seen whether such a\nwillingness to educate students on the\nrisks of alcohol will tempt Professor\nNutt to have a pint in the newly opened\nFiveSixEight.\nZainab Ali\nMatt Colvin\n\n"

When we are\nnot focused a network called the resting state\nnetwork is switched on, but we are hardly\naware of its activity. The resting state network\nallows us to day dream and branches across the\nbrain between the visual areas, motor areas and\nareas involved in abstract thought.\nThe Imperial study scanned the brain activity of 70 healthy infants. A 4-dimensional brain\natlas was drawn up by the Computing department and mapped activity to the known location of the resting state network in adults. It\nwas shown that the resting state network develops in the last 10 weeks of pregnancy and\nat birth looks much like an adult\u2019s, prompting\nthe question: are babies day dreaming in the\nwomb?\nWhen we daydream the resting state network\nallows introspection; triggering autobiographical memories and envisioning the future. Professor David Edwards, the lead author of the\nstudy, suggests that \u201cbeing a foetus is a lot\nmore fun than any of us can remember -- lying\nthere happily introspecting and thinking about\nthe future\u201d.\nThe study shows that babies\u2019 brains are more\nfully formed than previously thought. In gen-eral, it seems that our brains are constantly engaged in complex activities, which begin early\nin development.\nProfessor David Edwards has previously focused on preventing brain damage in babies by\npreventing oxygen starvation. He has recently\nbeen awarded the highly prestigious Arvo Ylpp\u00f6 medal. Professor Edward\u2019s future work will\ninvestigate how illnesses which disrupt the resting state network effect brain development.\nfMRI scans showed that babies\u2019 brains have a fully developed network of neurons\nStrung along by Brian Greene\nKatya-yani Vyas\nString theory is not a subject that would enthral\nmost people, it is hard physics, mathematical,\nuntested and impossible to visualise. On Thursday the 28th of October at the Wellcome Institute, I attended a discussion with Brian Greene\non the subject of String theory and the controversy and debate surrounding it. Brian Greene\nis a professor at Columbia University, author of\n\u2018The Elegant Universe\u2019 as well as being one of\nthe most well-respected and high profile string\ntheorists. The talk was facilitated by Professor\nA.C Grayling, author and professor of philosophy at Birkbeck University.\nThe talk began with a brief and concise introduction to some of the background physics and\nthe reasons for pursuing string theory. Greene\u2019s\neasy and relaxed manner is evident from the\nstart, his lilting American accent puts the audi-ence, and indeed Grayling, at ease. He begins\nwith a simple assertion that string theory holds\na unique place within science in that it is currently the best model we have that can unify the\nfour fundamental forces of nature. Without going into too much detail, this is the Holy Grail\nfor physicists.\nPerhaps I should give a brief overview of\nwhat String Theory is although most of it lies\nin a realm completely beyond my understand-ing. The idea is that all matter is made up of\ntiny vibrating strings; every particle has a particular frequency associated with it and, just as\ndifferent vibrations on a guitar string match up\nto different notes, each string\u2019s frequency corresponds to a different particle. This gives us a\nsingle constituent of all matter which is a tanta-lising prospect.\nGrayling was engaging in his role as interviewer and seemed to know quite a lot about\nthe subject himself, which enabled him to talk\nabout some of the criticisms of String Theory.\nFurther on in the interview Grayling steered\nthe discussion to the debate surrounding String\ntheory research and the amount of funding being funnelled into it. Greene seemed baffled by\nthe concern, especially as he perceived it as a\ndefinite non-issue.\nHe pointed out that string theorists want nothing more than the truth, and if string theory was\nclosest to revealing it then of course money\nshould be spent on it. He added that if it was\ndisproved then something else would take over\nand, whether correct or not, every effort should\nbe made to find out.\nGreene\u2019s explanations of some physics\nphenomenon were excellent, proving his credentials as a great communicator of science\nalthough his bestselling book is a far greater\ntestament to that.\nThe talk was enlightening, Greene and Grayling kept the attention of the room admirably\nwith witty and relaxed conversation. String\nTheory is far from being proven, but after this\nlecture I found myself anticipating a breakthrough with hope and optimism.\nFriday 05 November 2010\n\n"

The Conservatives have been planning to curb immigration since before\nthe election, and now more than ever it\nseems that universities will not be spared.\nNone of the changes made to the immigration system so far have affected\nstudents directly (although some are\nbound to have an indirect impact; see\nopposite page). The real trouble begins\nnext April, when the Government will\npermanently restrict immigration from\noutside the EU.\nThe precise scale and nature of these\nrestrictions are still unknown but, judging from Mr Green\u2019s recent comments,\nit looks as if student visas will be cur-tailed. This will have a marked effect\non those universities that rely heavily\non the tuition fees of internationals (no\npoints for guessing which one we\u2019re\nalluding to); it is the income generated\nfrom Mr Green\u2019s \u201cunsustainable\u201d levels\nof international students that sustains\nuniversities such as Imperial.\nTuition fees for Brits and Europeans\nare set to rise, but it is dubious whether\nthis can counteract a joint drop in government funding and international par-ticipation. The International Office at\nImperial emphasised this, saying: \u201cAt a\ntime when the government is proposing\ncuts to Higher Education funding, the\nincome from international tuition fees\nrepresents a significant financial contribution to the College.\u201d\nAt the same time, a different set of restrictions is being considered. The Tier\n1 Post Study Work visa (PSWV) allows\nrecent international graduates to remain\nin the UK to work for up to two years.\nThese are likely to be curtailed, forcing\ngraduates to leave the UK sooner. The\nInternational Office has pointed out that\n\u201cthe Post Study Work visa is an excellent incentive to encourage international\nstudents to choose the UK as a study\ndestination.\u201d The fear is that many exceptional international students will opt\nfor countries with lighter restrictions,\nand that as a result UK universities and\nthe UK economy as a whole will suffer.\nAmresh, a fourth year undergraduate\nand an international student, was not\ndeterred. He told Felix that he\u2019d \u201cmuch\nrather work in the UK.\u201d He did have\nsome reservations though: \u201cIf I\u2019m getting rejected from jobs just because I\u2019m\nnot British, I would be quite pissed off.\u201d\nUniversities are facing an academic\nand financial shortfall. How deeply these\nchanges will impact students \u2013 international and domestic \u2013 remains to be seen.\nStudents\nhit by visa\nchanges\nNavid Nabijou\nFriday 05 November 2010\n\n"
