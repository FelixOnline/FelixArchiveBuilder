    "content": "Opinion 23\nMedia Virus\nBeccy,\nI would be lying if I said that I have never\nbeen angered or frustrated by something printed\nin Felix. After all, what magazine or newspaper\ncan contain the views of such a wide cross-section of communities and not rub some people\nup the wrong way? No, I'm not angry with Felix\nfor printing something contentious. I'm not\nangry because of a letter or article that is\nfallacious or misleading. I'm furious, because as\neditor of Felix, you have managed to reduce one\nof the most interesting and perhaps acclaimed\nstudent newspapers in the country to an irrelevant rag, devoid of news, filled with stuffing\ninstead of meat. I'm angry because of things\nFelix isn't printing, not because of what it is.\nWhat do you think your role as Felix Editor\nis? In fact, what do you think the purpose of\nFelix is? No, Beccy, it's not a chance for you to\nproduce a nice 'safe' format periodical for a year. Nor is it your opportunity to get some\nbrownie points for your CV. Felix is there to\nserve the students of Imperial College and so are\nyou. Felix should be the vehicle through which\nstudents get to know about student issues: it\nshould be relevant. Felix should convey the\nfeelings and views of students: it should be\naccessible. Felix should be a medium through\nwhich students can explore relevant issues and\nprovoke discussion: it should be a platform.\nAt the moment Felix is none of these things.\nIt contains space-filling articles of little or no\nrelevance to current student issues; Reviews of\nbooks, theatre and music(!), all of which are not\nonly extremely subjective opinions, but can be\nfound in myriad professional weekly periodicals\nsuch as Time Out, and 'news' which is in fact\n'olds' because it happened over a week ago.\nArticles submitted to Felix are being rejected\nand non-hack contributors are given pathetic,\nwhimsical excuses in return.\nMore specifically Beccy, I am astounded,\nnearly to the point of speechless ness, by the\ncasual audacity of your decision not to print an\narticle I gave to you from the editor of Fuse, the\nNorth London Universities' magazine concerning\nthe now snowballing Media Virus Campaign, a student campaign using the humble telephone to\nregister student opinion with national media in\nan attempt to raise the profile of student\nobjections to the government's proposals\naffecting funding and student unions. It would\nhave informed IC students about the campaign\nand how they could participate. Thanks to you,\nthey know nothing of the campaign and are\nmissing out on the opportunity to join a national\ncampaign fighting for their rights.\nI was annoyed when you chose not to print it\nlast week, but knowing how difficult you seem\nto find printing anything submitted less than a week in advance, I was perhaps not surprised. I was stunned when it didn't appear this week.\nHow dare you decide that the students of IC\ndon't need to know about this? Did you think it\nwas irrelevant? So irrelevant that 200\nuniversities around Britain are now participating.\nSo irrelevant that Glasgow University have\ndedicated an entire office to the campaign, that\nBirmingham have brought in special telephones\nfor this purpose? So irrelevant, in fact, that the\ncampaign has been covered by The Guardian,\nThe Telegraph and the Today programme on\nRadio 4. The national media are queuing up to\ncover it. BBC Scotland and Northern Ireland,\nRight To Reply, Comment (Channel 4), Pebble\nMill, The Late Show and even MTV for Christ's sake, have all been in contact. And Felix! You,\nin your wisdom, decided it is not newsworthy.\nYou decided on behalf of the students of IC not\nto participate. What gives you this right?\nI will stick my neck out and guess your major\ndefence on this one. Is it the old argument, \"we\nneed articles to be submitted before Tuesday\nbecause it take us four days to typeset?\" I realise\nthat you must plan the format in advance, so that\nyou have multiples of four pages. Obviously\nadding or taking articles away is not easy given\nthis constraint. On top of this, you have the time\nit takes to typeset a page: three to four days for\nthe entire issue, so I am told. Your solution is to\nsacrifice the quality of the issue in hand for the\nquality of presentation. Wrong. Presentation\nquality should always be subordinated to quality\nof content. You should pride yourself on the\ncontents of Felix, not its layout.\nAnd are you telling me that nothing is typeset\non the Wednesday or Thursday? Of course it is.\nGet your priorities right. You should be planning\nso that articles which can be postponed for a week are typeset last. This way you will have\ntime to fit in a last minute article at the expense\nof a music review which can wait.\nHaving edited on a smaller scale myself and\nbeing a close friend of the only non-sabbatical\neditor in the history of Felix (Andy Butcher), I understand the time constraints of producing a weekly magazine or newspaper. I know it's possible to include 'news' - your excuses are\ntotally unsubstantiated. You have no reason to\nprint a review in favour of important news or a relevant article submitted by a student.\nAnd letters? The number of letters received is\na good indication of the number of people that\nread it. No surprises then, that last week's Felix\ncontained one letter and this week's had a record\nzero. You're not helping yourself by insisting on\nthe presentation of a Union card with every\nletter. What on earth is the purpose of this? It\nhasn't been done by editors in the past so what\nmakes you think you need it? I remember Felix\nwhen it had two or three pages of letters which\nmade fascinating reading and made Felix feel\nlike a genuine student paper; It was addressing\nstudent issues. Contentious 'flame wars'\nbetween sometimes anonymous writers made\nFelix a regular on my reading list. These days I skim through it in less than a minute and then\nput it in the bin.\nFor the record this letter will be presented to\nyou on the morning of Tuesday 8th February,\njust past the deadline you normally set, giving\nyou three whole days to find room for it. As\nusual, I will even supply it on disk so that you\ndon't have to type it in. Your image in the eyes\nof the students will be defined by the effort you\nmake to print this.\nGareth Davies, Physics PG3.\nImperial and the University of Life\nDear Ed.,\nIn recent issues there has been some talk\nabout the apathy amongst students at Imperial\nCollege in thinking about matters outside\nacademic affairs and at the risk of getting my\nfingers burned I would like to add some fuel to\nthe fire in the light of last week's ideology\nfeature (end simi lie). We can only write from personal experience\n- things we have heard, seen, felt and done - and\nthe speed of modern media has helped to bring\nthese experiences to us more rapidly than ever\nbefore. The media has presented to me over the\npast year home truths which I find have\nshattered many of my ideals/idols.\nAs I read of the worsening of the war in\nBosnia, famine in Somalia, the deaths of two\nboys in the Warrington bombing and two other\nboys being responsible for the murder of James\nBulger - Michael Jackson's 'Heal the World'\nwas played at his funeral before yet another boy\nalleged sexual abuse, forever tarnishing the\nimage of the man behind the myth - as I have\nseen this happen around me I have contemplated\nmy own position in the world, studying in the\nbricks and concrete jungle that is IC.\nNow I know that the majority of IC students\ndon'tv oic i bly express these opinions (in which\ncase this letters page would normally be far\nfuller) but I am sure they must ponder the issues\nfrom time to time. As I have matured over the\ntwo and a half years at IC many of my academic\nideals too have been dispelled: the joy of\nlearning and a communal spirit of purpose to\nunderstand have been replaced by the more\nrealistic aims of protecting one's own interests,\nand keeping one's head above water.\nIn our department I see career-obsessed, self-centred go-get ter s either not caring for learning\nfor its own sake and only seeking to do the\nminimum to pass exams, or the mark-hungry\nacademics with the sole aim of a first. I would\nbe the first to call hypocrisy on my part - I am\nforced to comply or be another casualty of this\nrat race. Now I may be wrong - there may not be\na problem at all: this is, after all, preparation for\nreal life in the modern world - but in my mind,\nsuch one-dimensionality seems tragic.\nI end with the well-known peer to student\nadage: you go to University not only to learn but\nto receive an education. Thank you Ed./reader\nfor printing/reading this letter in its en tir it y. Perhaps there are some ideologists out there who\nwould like to reply to or comment on some of\nthe points I have raised.\nSagar Das, Chem Eng 3.\nThere is a news article on the Media Virus Campaign on page 2\n\n"

Not any more! Not only has the\nvolleyball court been demolished leaving us with\ninsufficient court space for U AU matches, but\non top of that we have lost almost all our court\ntime in the Great Hall. This has resulted in a drastic loss of membership and almost complete\nlack of practice.\nExtremely worried, we went to the conference office to point out that they are wiping\nthe Badminton Club out of existence. After\ncontinuous phoning for a few days, Anne Kemp\nfrom the Conference Office finally agreed to a meeting. She assured us that she 'really wanted\nto help us', only to follow up five minutes later\nwith 'I'm intending to stop badminton from\nusing the Great Hall permanently'. Her reasons\nfor this are simply 'badminton is not prestigious\nenough - I want more prestigious events to take\nplace in the Great Hall' and 'you don't bring in\nany money'.\nThe Union's attitude to us has been one of\n'there is nothing we can do'. We have been\ngiven the use of St Mary's courts over at\nPaddington on Saturday and Sunday mornings -hardly an option for most people. Training after\nCollege hours is convenient for everyone while\nmany students go away or return home at\nweekends and others face a long journey to train\nfor a few hours. I have lost track of the number\nof people who have expressed an interest in\nbadminton only to be disappointed and say there\nis no way they can train on a weekend morning.\nWhat about Wednesday afternoons - the\nsporting afternoon of the student week? Surely\nwe should be able to play then. We have been\ngiven just two Wednesday afternoons in the\nGreat Hall this term and the grand total of one\nevening in the Great Hall for the whole of\nJanuary.\nTwo years ago we had the Great Hall\nMonday and Friday evenings for anyone to play,\nTuesday evenings and Wednesday afternoons\nfor team practice and Thursday evenings for\nmatches. Last year they cut down these sessions\nbut we could still rely on three or four sessions a week. Now we can't even get enough sessions to\narrange all our matches! If this continues we will\nbe thrown out of the leagues for not completing\nenough matches. All our teams used to be in the\nFirst Division of the Hammersmith Leagues but\nnow we are currently in the Second Division in\nthe men's and ladies and in the First Division in\nthe mixed.\nCompare also this year'sUA U results with\nprevious years' standards. Two years ago the\nladies team got to the semi-finals of the U AU, last year to the quarter finals of the U AU. This\nyear all three teams - Ladies, Men'sl sts and\nMen's2 nds went out in the first round of the\nU AU. The team has hardly changed but the\namount of practice we were given has. Only a few weeks ago in Felix Charles Leary expressed\ndisappointment with this years U AU results and\nsaid he was trying to increase practice times for\nclubs. Maybe he has, but not for badminton.\nIs Imperial College actually concerned with\nits students? Sport has never been a priority of\nImperial College but now badminton is not even\n'prestigious' enough to gain access to the\ntraining facilities available in College. If this\ngoes on I 'll be extremely surprised to find an\nImperial College Badminton Club in a couple of\nyears time. Watch out Orchestra, Choir and any\nother clubs that use the Great Hall or any other\nsites in College, you may not be considered\n'prestigious' enough either.\nWendy Yates\nCaptain, Badminton Club\nClub and society events for next week are listed in the Diary\n\n"

    "content": "News\nStudents' Virus\nThe Queen's Tower - an artist's canvas;\nQueen's Art\nBY MIKE INGRAM\nThe Queen's Tower is to become\npart of a work of art.\nThe Tower will be involved in\nan exhibition organised by the\nRoyal College of Art. During the\n'Remote Control' exhibition,\nvarious landmarks in South\nKensington will be used by\nnumerous artists to create a collection of art. The artist Anne Eggebert\nwill be \"using the devices of\nsurveillance and the historical\ncontext of the Queen's Tower to\nexplore the conflicting emotions of\nfear and pleasure which underline\nthe relationship between observation and power\".\nOther works in the exhibition\ninvolve such things as the Royal\nCollege of Art itself, the Albert\nMemorial and a roving diplomatic\ncar.\nThe exhibition will run from\n23rd February to 13th March.\nBY SHATJN JOYNSON\nA national student protest campaign\nhas been dismissed as a 'damp\ns qui b' by its intended victims.\nStudents from the University of\nNorth London ( UN L), masterminding the Media Virus\nCampaign, had hoped to involve\nstudents from Imperial College in a plan to cripple Government and\nmedia organisations by bombarding\nthem with phone calls protesting\nabout student reforms (see letter on\npage 23). However, despite being\nin operation for more than two\nweeks, the campaign appears to be\nhaving little effect, A spokesperson\nfor the Department of Education\nand Science - the campaign's prime\ntarget - told Felix that the protests\n\"have not affected us in any way\nwhatsoever\".\nThe BBC, another prime target,\nwas equally disparaging. Press\nspokeswoman Helen Cleary burst\ninto laughter on being told by Felix\nabout the campaign. Ms Cleary\nsaid that the BBC had been\ncontacted, but after checking the\nrecords kept of protest phone calls\nfrom the public, she stated that only\nsix calls from students had been\nreceived in the last two weeks.\nThe unconcerned attitude of the\ncampaign's targets is matched by\nthe distaste expressed by many\nstudent unions at the protesters'\nmethods. They believe that these\ncould alienate potential supporters\nin the media. Imperial College\nUnion President Andrew Wensley\nwas briefed on the Media Virus\ncampaign at a University of London\nUnion meeting in January.\n\"Frankly,\" he said, \"we felt that this\nwas not the best way of tackling\nstudents' problems.\"\nAnd, while the organisers claim\nthe Media Virus is supported by up\nto 200 universities nationwide,\nstudent unions at many of the co un try' s top universities have distanced\nthemselves from the campaign.\nUndeterred by this, Justin Kirby,\ninformation coordinator for Media\nVirus, regards its first stage as a success. In answer to the group's critics, he said: \"So long as we get\nthe message across that the\nGovernment's student reforms are a bad thing, how that message is put\nacross is irrelevant.\"\nMedia Virus is the brainchild of\nUN L student Paul Ryan. It was\ninspired by the success of Parisian\nstudents who, in 1986, managed to\nforce the French Government to\nmake an embarrassing U turn over\nstudent reforms. Like them, Ryan\nused college electronic mail\nnetworks to send strategic information to campuses around the\ncountry. Ryan'se mail message\ncalls for national newspapers and\nradio stations to be targeted \"positively\"( in a non-confrontational\nway), but adds: \"Those [organisations] who fail to respond [favour-ably], will become negative\ntargets.\"\nIn an interview with Felix, Kirby\noutlined the sort of treatment negative targets may receive, saying:\n\"We want to make an example of a national newspaper.\" The intention\nis to pressure advertisers into\ncancelling their advertising with the\npaper. Top of the hit-list is The\nIndependent. The paper's editor,\nAndreas Whittam-Smith, was\nunwilling to comment at this time.\nCabinet Office Forces Imperial Out\nBY JOE MCFADDEN\nAND MIKE INGRAM\nStaff and students at Imperial\nCollege have missed the opportunity to enter MegaLab UK, a unique\nnationwide experiment to be staged\nas part of National Science Week,\nbecause the College was not\ninformed of the event in time.\nMegaLab UK will use the\ncombined audiences of The Daily\nTelegraph, BBC Radio 1 and\nTomorrow's World as participants\nin one or more mass experiments\ndesigned around suggestions by\nscientists and the public. The experiment will be just one of the many\nevents intended to promote science,\nengineering and technology during\nthe 'Set7' National Science Week,\nwhich starts on March 18th. The search for a national experiment suitable for MegaLab UK was\nannounced on February 2nd, with\nFebruary 9th as the closing date for\nentries. However, Imperial College\ndidn't receive the press release for\nMegaLab UK and only heard of the\nevent when an electronic mail\nconcerning the event was brought to\ntheir attention. Unfortunately, there\nwas not enough time for College\ndepartments to prepare entries for\nthe competition. Melanie Thody,\nImperial College's Press Officer for\nNational Science Week said: \"We\nwould have been delighted to enter\nif we'd been given a month's notice.\"\nA spokesperson for the Cabinet\nOffice claimed the press release was\nsent to Imperial College along with\nother academic institutions. She\nsaid: \"MegaLab UK was also\nannounced in the Daily Telegraph,\non Radio 1 and Tomorrow's World.\nSo far the response has been good,\nwith everyone from learned scientists to youngsters writing in with\nsuggestions.\"\nDespite the response to the\ncompetition, many people feel\nangry at being denied the opportunity to perform useful research due\nto government d is organisation. The Cabinet Office spokesperson commented: \"We might\nhave preferred a later deadline, but\nwe needed to have responses... so\nwe could evaluate them in time.\"\nA letter referring to the Media Virus Campaign is on page 23\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion 21\nOpen Letter to IC Students R.E.S.P.E.C.T. Although the community at Imperial College is\nknown for its cosmopolitan nature, certainly in\ncomparison with other academic institutions in\nBritain, this advantageous position has, for too\nlong, been neglected, and even ignored by the\nstudents. At lectures and tutorials, we find\nourselves working next to, and with, students\nfrom the far reaches of the world. But do we\never stop to think of the wealth of knowledge we\ncould harness by displaying an interest in the\nothers' cultures and backgrounds? I suggest that\nfor the vast majority of us, the answer is no. At\n6pm, the home community, and its overseas\ncounterparts part company. And except for a club activity, or, in the case of first years, a hall\nouting, will rarely meet again until lectures the\nfollowing morning. The divide is further\nillustrated by the complete lack of presence of\noverseas students at evening Union events.\nThis divide, I would suggest, will always\nexist. It is the nature of different communities to\nremain independent. However, I feel that this\nstage of our life is probably the best moment for\nunderstanding to develop. Due to advances in\ntechnology, the world is becoming a smaller and\nsmaller place to live in. In a few years, a lot of\nus will find ourselves conducting business with\nthe members of other nations. The new nature of\nBritain itself, means that even if you are\nworking at a local level, you are bound to have\ndealings with members of other communities.\nSurely we should not lose this opportunity,\nwhile we are all on a level playing field, to begin\nthe process of learning about one another.\nWhere this whole argument is leading to, is\nthe opportunity we have with our overseas\nsocieties, to begin this process. The Overseas\nStudents' Committee has 26 constituent\nsocieties representing a vast cross-section of the\ncultures found on our planet. Several of these\nsocieties have, in recent past organised events.\nThese are not just, as the popular image seems to\nbe, for the benefit of the students from that\ncultures, but are also aimed at the student\ncommunity in general. A good example is the\nrecent 'Swing Singapore' event, organised by\nthe Singapore Society. The exhibition put on in\nthe Great Hall, was most impressive, and, was\ncertainly as professionally put together as many\nmuseum displays. The level of effort put in was\nnot just so that Singaporean students could see\nwhat they already knew, but was rather more\naimed at the student in general. However, as far\nas I could see, despite high levels of advertising,\nvery few members of the general student\ncommunity showed an interest.\nAll overseas student societies are open to all\nmembers of the Union. I would encourage you\nall to take an interest. Furthermore, the most\nimportant event involving the overseas\ncommunity, and certainly the largest student\nevent since the Union Freshers' Fair at the start\nof this year, is yet to occur. International Nite\n'94 is due to take place on Friday 4th March.\nMost of the overseas student societies will be\ntaking part, be it in the International Food Fair,\nor the Cultural Show. Contrary to general\nopinion, this is not just an overseas affair, but\nrather, an event for the whole College to enjoy.\nIf you are a home student, who has until now,\nnot taken any interest in overseas events, then I would particularly encourage you to come\nalong. Tickets will be on sale in the Union\nOffice, and in the Sherfield Foyer in the coming\nweeks. I look forward to seeing you all then!\nMustafa Zakir Hussain\nChairman,\nOverseas Students' Committee.\nDear Beccy,\nIt is a sad reflection of our society that we\nseem to be running out of role-models. Integrity\nis a dying maxim. Many people in occupations\nwhich traditionally commanded respect and admiration appear to be as fallible as the rest of us.\nThe media portrays the Royal Family as a bunch of muppets and politicians as sexually-perverse hypocrites. When you think of a Justice\nof the Peace, do you not think of a plump ageing\ngentleman more in touch with the ins and outs\nof wig maintenance than the real world? What\nof the law enforcers, the police? Reading the\npaper the other day I was left with a sense, albeit\nan illegitimate one, of the police being at best\nineffectual and at worst corrupt. Our religious\nleaders, meanwhile, seem to be either condemning us to death or boring us to the same end.\nChildren growing up today must be more\ndisillusioned than ever especially with more\nfamily units breaking up. Many youngsters\ndon't even respect their parents. So who should\nthey respect? According to Matt Bianco we\nshould respect ourselves and Aretha simply says\nwe should respect (just a little bit). The youth of\ntoday are left with role-models who make music\nor movies or who parade up and down cat-walks. Should we respect someone for their\nphysical appearance? Of course not! But do we?\nRespect is a precious commodity and it\nshould be exercised when we recognise great\nwisdom or talent. But though I might go to a Prince concert and buy the Purple Rain album, I will certainly not purchase a pair of purple\nplatform shoes. If we could all aspire to achieve\nthe qualities of those people whom we recognise\nto be the best holders of those virtues then\nsurely we are some way to being worthy of\nother people's respect ourselves.\nYours respectfully,\nS. A. Shaw, Mech Eng 3.\nWasteland Of Mindlessness - A Turning Point\nDear Felix,\nThank you for the opportunity to state a few\nbrief thoughts of mine about our College\nregarding its academic atmosphere. As the title\nshows, not only do I quite agree with the letter\nof Marcus Alexander on the 21st Jan. issue, but I would like to take his points a bit further.\n\"How do you like life at Imperial?\" is a standard question for me, posed to me by people.\nMy answer is the following: \"Being a2nd year\nnow I like my course and most of the subjects,\nwhat I do mind is the total lack of a proper academical atmosphere meaning circulation of ideas\nand a sense of the problems of the world we live\nin\". The answer to that from people being in\nEngland longer than myself is that \"this is the\ncase for all English universities\". Well, I don't know about the others' standards, I know about\nmy College. As Marcus Alexander points out:\n\"In a place which lays claim 7,000 of the highest\nIQs in the country this is purely absurd.\"\nI 've come across this \"what's that have to do\nwith your subject?\" so many times. Almost everyone I told about my involvement in the European\nYouth Parliament or the Europe 2020 conference\nreacted pretty much the same way. Later, of\ncourse, one realises that the similarity between a multi-interest person and a non-activist is the\nsame as the similarity between one's course and\nan extra-cur icu llar activity: nothing at all! It\nseems too many people think university is about\ntaking a degree through a continuous hangover\nin order to make some money later on. The exact\nimpression that the JCR and Da Vinci's give a stranger: life's about a pint of real ale and a chicken'n 'mushroom pie. This is probably a low-level education, but certainly not pae dia( sic).\nI am quite glad, though, that I know of people\nwho detest this, and my message here is meant\nfor them. I would like to have everyone's recommendations, opinions, proposals or comments\nabout the formation of a society that will go\nbeyond all the ICU clubs and societies, i.e. the\nformation of the Youth of Europe society. I conjure it up as a unique platform of discussion\nand opinion-exchange about the past, present\nand future of the Continent we live in, its\norganised events ranging from speeches, lectures\nand debates to art exhibitions, concerts and\naway-breaks to European cities, thus encompassing interests in politics, economics, history,\nmusic, philosophy and art. Although I have not\nyet a definite idea about this, I consider it a very\nserious and important blueprint for what will be\nthe most vibrant and multi-coloured society in\nthe College. Therefore I urge all my fellow\nstudents interested to contact me and share their\nviews and ideas. My e mail address is kh@ee.ic.\nac.uk or you can drop a note in my pigeonhole.\nI await the response of the student body.\nYours,\nKyriakos Hatzaras,\nGreek Delegation for Europe 2020.\nThe deadline for letters is Monday, 6pm "

There were some house\nspecialities - dishes which did not consist of\npasta. There are some pizzas.I had the Calzone\n(folded pizza) and liked it, but it didn't fill me\nup. The same applied to the pasta dishes, they\ntaste fine but are a little small.\nThe dessert menu is a separate affair and the\nnames and descriptions are tant a lising. I ordered\nmy lemon cheesecake in anticipation and it\ntasted nice, but again was far to small.\nNon-alcoholic drinks cost around a pound\nand the service was reasonable but the waitress\nkept forgetting us!\nBella Pasta is too pricey for its reputation,\natmosphere and clientele. I wouldn't go there\nagain, even though the food is pretty good,\nthere's not enough of it! A filling meal would\ncost around \u00a312.\nI am afraid Bella Pasta gets 4/10.\nCuba\nTo make a change from the usual Chinese,\nIndian or Italian when you go out Cuba is the\nplace to go. Unsurprisingly, the food is Cuban\nand the atmosphere is like you would imagine\nwith reggae music blasting through your bones.\nBefore coming here I had never tried Cuban\nfood and little of the menu was recognisable, but\ndon't let that stop you, it adds to the thrill! You\nmay meet the bouncer on entering, but there is\nno dress code.\nThe decor is a little strange and doesn't remind you of Cuba at all. The chairs are wood\nand string jobs and they are all different, but it\nall fits in. The candelabras are very nice, differing from table to table and I wish I could have\ntaken one home with me.\nEnough of the general ambience and onto the\nfood! The menu is in Cuban (with English\nsubtitles). Tapas (starters) all cost \u00a32.75 and are\nfairly large. I tried the Pulpeta (Cuban meatloaf),\nand was satisfied. Try the Chorizo A La Plancha\nor Machacon for something different.\nFor the main course there is a choice of meat,\nseafood and vegetarian dishes.The portions are\nhuge and I could not finish mine (yep, skip the\nstarters). I recommend a Plato Cominado\nCubano (\u00a310) to get a taste of a variety of things.\nThe seafood is good, with the Gambas 'San\nAntonio' (\u00a39) receiving a definite thumbs up.\nThe chefs are equally skilled with the veggie\nfood and people walk out satisfied, especially\nwith Paella Payesa Cubana (\u00a38).\nThe desserts (\u00a32.50) were a bit of a let down,\nrather Western in their style. The Cuban Apple\nPie, or coconut ice-cream are about as 'au then tic' as I could see. I was too full to try any.\nSoft drinks cost \u00a31 and Cuban coffee is on\noffer. The cocktails are large and a wide range is\navailable, but a jug of Margarita is the best way\nto get into the swing of things.\nUndoubtedly the joint is kick in': the music is\nloud and everyone is evidently enjoying their\nfood and drinks. The food is well cooked and\neven though Cuba is close to Mexico the food is\nCaribbean - exciting, slightly spicy and a greater\nuse of vegetables. The service is good; the only\ndrawbacks are that the meal will cost around\n\u00a315, but I think it is money well spent. Cuba\ndoes get busy, so it's best to book. I 'll happily\ngo there again and again.\nCuba gets 8/10.\nNainish B Student\nAccommodation Office\nVacancies in College Residences\nas at 14/2/94\nRef Hall Type Sex UG/PG From Licence\n1. 8 Earls Ct Sq Twin M PG Now 51-Week\n2.

He looked up from the papers\nand books on his desk, where he'd been working\nall night. The morning sky glowed a burnished\nsteel blue, cool, distant and indifferent. It\npromised to be one of those crisp, sunlit winter\ndays he normally liked so much.\nThis is ridiculous, he thought. A few hours'\nwork has taken me all weekend. Shaking his\nhead, he returned to his work. About an hour\nlater, he stood up and stretched. That was it,\nfinished, another fraction of a course unit\ntowards the degree. He had time for a shower, a shave and breakfast\nbefore making it to the\ntutorial. He headed for the\nbathroom.\nOver breakfast, Sinatra\ncame on the radio with a song about how\nunforgettable someone\nwas. Muttering \"bloody hell\", he switched it off.\nThe sudden pain slowly subsided into a dull\nthrobbing in the background as he finished\nbreakfast and started to set off for College.\nHe regained consciousness, realising he had\ndozed off in the middle of the tutorial. Alarmed,\nhe looked around, if anyone had noticed, they\nweren't showing it. He glanced at his watch:\nrelief, he'd only been unconscious for a few\nminutes, if that. Brace yourself, there's certainly\nworse to come.\nWith the lunch break to spend before the\nafternoon lectures, he headed for the dining hall\nwhere he knew his friends would be gathering\nfor lunch, seeking the comfort of the small,\nfamiliar group. He found them at a table next to\na window.\n\"Hey look who's here! Where have you been\nall weekend? You look like you haven't slept in\nthree days!\", \" Hi guys, the weekend was a bit of\na disaster, major work crisis, you know how it\ngoes.\" The sunlight bathed everyone, mak-ing\nhighlights dance in their hair as they talked and\nlaughed. It was a time to be sav our ed, and he felt\nhis spirits rising.\nThen, without warning, all hopes he had of\nregaining some kind of composure were dashed.\nThere is, then, to be no mercy, no quarter given.\nShe greeted everybody as she made her way\ndown the table. Looking up at her in stunned\ndisbelief, his eyes met hers as she included him\nin the general greeting. Her irises shone like\npools of sunlit honey as she sat down almost\ndirectly opposite him. Her presence exploded\ninside him and reverberated along every fibre of\nhis being, with all the power, beauty and majesty\nof the opening chords of a symphony.\nIt was the last thing he expected. Her arrival\npleasantly surprised everyone. Long time no see\nand all that. Yes, she'd been rather busy all\nweek, lunch breaks? Forget it! He was alarmed\nto notice one of his closest friends casting a quick, searching glance at him. Christ on a Suddenly, she turned\nback and looked at him\ndirectly...\nHarley Davidson. He fixed his eyes on his plate\nand attacked the food. No use, amazing what\nresistance a College dining hall meal can put up\nsometimes.\nA conversation started nearby on the\nprospects of the coming motor racing season.\nThank God: a way out. The next half hour was\nall Formula One and who was probably driving\nfor which team and why and what the new cars\nwere going to be like and active suspension and\ntraction control and aerodynamics and all the\nrest of the whole pointless multi million dollar\ncircus. It was pathetic, but it was all he could do.\nInside him, all was in turmoil. He was torn\nbetween the intensely\npainful beauty of her all-conquering presence in\nhis soul, and his despair\nof ever sharing that\nbeauty with her. He\ncould never be to her\nwhat she was to him, that\nmuch she had made clear. What to do? She\npervaded everything: his work, the books he\nread, the music that used to be such a consolation. Now every jot of work he did, every\npage he read, every note he heard was suffused\nwith her essence. There was no escape, no\nsanctuary.\nAt last, he heard her saying she had to go. All\nthis time they had sat almost facing each other\nand hardly exchanged a word. It had once been\nso different. He grieved his loss. The door to a world of beauty and truth, of love and happiness\nhad once stood ajar before him and his heart had\nechoed with a wordless song of joy, wonder and\nlonging before the lovely vision. And barely had\nhe taken the first fearful step but the door\ninevitably swung shut, the song silenced, the\nsweet dawn-light snuffed out. Nevermore.\nHe watched as she stood and said she had to\ngo. He silently raised his hand, but she turned\naway. He looked on, hand raised, as she walked\naway. Then suddenly, she turned back and\nlooked at him directly. He met her gaze, his\nhand still raised and her eyes again reflected the\nsunlight. For an instant, he felt as if the gulf that\nhad opened between them had vanished, the\nchasm bridged, the door opened again.\nFor an instant she stood motionless, and he\nfelt as if in that instant, that he was powerless to\nonce more try to put in words, gathered strength\nfrom the light that shone in her eyes and jumped\nacross, across from his heart through the space\nbetween them and into those huge eyes that now\nseemed to occupy his whole field of vision, his\nentire world.\nThen she smiled, she smiled with her eyes\nand in her eyes he could see she knew, she knew\nbut couldn't share, she couldn't share and could\nonly leave, leave him outside the door to her\nheart that was now closed to him forever.\nShe turned away again and left. He still\nlooked on, his hand still raised. The world had\nsuddenly emptied.\nThere was only one thing left to do now.\nThough the sun shone, it was bitterly cold on\nthe balcony nine floors up. An aeroplane flew\noverhead, glistening metal bubble in the sky. He\ncould see another three further away. He walked\nto the edge.\nIn his hand he had the letters, all of them, the\nones he had written and never sent. His eyes\nlingered on the words for a while. The lines\nswam and shimmered as his eyes watered,\nmaybe it was the cold.\nSlowly and deliberately, almost tenderly, he\nbegan to tear the pages. He threw the pieces to\nthe wind. They pirouetted crazily in the sunlit\nspace. They looked like a swarm of butterflies\nflying across the space between the buildings.\nLook, my thoughts can fly like butterflies.\nThey're the most beautiful thoughts I 've ever\nmade. If only you'd share them, I could fly to\nyou with them, even if you stood on that roof\nover there. How did that joke go? Two people on\nopposite sides of a drop like this one. One of\nthem says, look, I 've got a torch, I 'll shine a light beam across the gap, you could walk across\non it. The other answers, you don't fool me,\nyou'll only turn it off when I'm halfway across\nand let me drop.\nYou shone a light beam across at me. You\nnever expected me to walk it, but I did. I loved\nyou and trusted you and walked the beam and\ndidn't fall, I floated, I soared, held up by the\nlight you shone at me. You thought I'd never do\nit, nobody in their right mind would try to walk\non a light beam across an abyss, but suddenly\nthere I was halfway across and you turned off\nthe light.\nYou turned off the light, you had to keep me\naway no matter what, but look! I'm not falling, I can fly, I can do anything, I can tear my heart\ninto little strips and throw it to the wind, I can\neven just let you turn and walk away because I love you.\nGeorge\nPart 4 of Cracking Cryptic Crosswords is on the back page\n\n"

    "content": "16 Reviews\niii ii1I11 Pavement\nCrooked Rain CrookedRain\nWe used to love Pavement for their dopey\ngenius, inspired by the breath of real mania. The\nmusic? Mad and unique, it was often excused\nfor the band's sake, for the idea and the lo-fi\nideology. This is not to decry 'Slanted...' or\n'Westing...', but precious songs speckled those\nalbums like fool's gold. Tell me you never\nwished for highways of 'Summer Babe' or\n'Zurich is Stained': you don't wish cheaply if\nyou simply smiled contented at these backstreet s. Then came 'The Unseen Power of the Picket\nFence', on 'No Alternative' last autumn, and\nthis indie world of mirrors gasped in unison at\nthe anthem of tapping feet. Pavement\nunder slung a bass and got so funky, so funny\nand poignant that it was immediately tossed on\ntop of the tatty piled vinyl that is the Pavement's Greatest Hits collection. We waited.\nWhat the press and press offices promised\nhas arrived. A pop pier Pavement, singing about\nthe silly death of rock to jerk rock riffs, blues\nand all that jazz. The album is a natural high, a sudden rush that only smiles wider with time.\nMalkmus bites at other bands, at triviality - \"I care, I care, I really don't care, Did you see the\ndrummer's hair?\", and at ignoble hair cuts.\nSongs? 'Cut Your Hair' is, of course, an\nanthem, 'Unfair', an elated and Venice-bridged\nmarvel, 'Range Life' shows how to be quirky\nwithout being irksome. Matters do tail off a little; Heaven may well be 'a truck' but on Earth\nit was the previous sunrise of songs. Perhaps by\nthen I'm just to happy to care. Because whereas\nbefore I used to smile at them, now the mania's all been given to me, is mine. (9) - Owain\nIf1;:>:;::'::: III\nIIII111 Therapy?\nTroublegum\nFrom the moment the opener, ' Knives', steamrollers in with its Helmet-style razor riffs,\nhyperactive drums and intense vocals, you know\nthat you're in for one big adrenal in kick. The\nwonderfully fat chorus of 'Screamager', the\ndeliberate Bob Mould impression in the middle\nof 'Stop It You're Killing Me', the great cover\nof Joy Division's 'Isolation'...the magic just\nkeeps coming. In fact the only downer is the\noccasionally laughable lyric. Take the line\n\"masturbation saved my life\". Well, I'm glad to\nhear that it could give you a helping hand, but\ndid it really make you \"nervous as a child?\"\nStill if you can get past that and like your\nheavy metal blessed with a punk spirit and sharp\nsense of melody, then invest in this, you won't end up doing any teeth grinding.(8) Vik\nAn absolute bumper crop to bring to you this\nweek. Either the food of love is in the air or the\nfat accounting cats are clued up on the value of\nvalentine releases. Red roses and the new\nSepultura single. Enough to turn anyone's head.\nJust to buck the trend we'll start with a single\nreleased next Monday, under the banner of the\nlast British Rock band. They've been heralded\non every front cover under the sun, but is it all\nmeaningless? Primal Scream, reborn under the\nwatchful mixing desk of George Drakoulias (of\nBlack Crowes fame) kick off into the baleful\nspotlight of fame with their double A side,\n'Rocks/Funky Jam'. 'Rocks' is more than a nod,\nactually a deep bow to the early Rolling Stones.\nSpiky guitar, bar room piano and smashing\ntambourine, with Bobby Gillespie trilling \"get\nyour rocks off in his best lip curling style.\n'Funky Jam' plugs into the New Orleans'\nbrassy dance groove thanks to big George\nClinton. And while there are worse things to be\nthan retro, I think we'll have to wait for the\nalbum to see if they can do more than just dye\ntheir hair black in the name of musical progress.\nLet's return to Sepultura, whose cage-ridden\nfans plagued the Word not so long ago. Our own\nfan appears in the figure of Freddy Cheeseworth.\n\"They could be content to stand head and\nshoulders above their rivals merely on the merits\nof their intensity, sound and image but, no\nthey've only got to go and write good songs as\n\u00a9TDK\nCAMPUS CHART\nFebruary 1994\n1. 8IG TIME SENSUALITY Bjork One Litlle Indian2.

    "content": "Clubs and Societies\nMotor Sports\nChampionship\nLast weekend the National Students' Motor\nSports Championship took place in Cambridge.\nThe competition is only open to students and\ngives them a chance to test their skills against\nothers who also can't afford a turbo-charged\nfour-wheel drive supercar. It takes the form of\nthree separate competitions: an auto test, which\ninvolves the driver hand braking the car round\ntraffic cones in a car park against the clock; a table-top rally, where the navigator solves rally\nnavigation clues and a160 mile all-night road\nrally, where the crew scream down country lanes\nin the dead of night. The event usually attracts\nentrants from most university motor clubs, and\nthis year C&GC U Motor Club had the arduous\ntask of improving on fifth place achieved by a crew from the club last year.\nThings started to deviate from the plan of\naction a week before the rally, when we\ndiscovered that the front shock absorbers were\nknacker ed and had to be rebuilt. How long does\nit take to rebuild a pair of shock absorbers we\nwondered? Three weeks minimum came the\nreply from he manufacturers. After much\ncajoling they agreed to do them in a week, so at\n5pm on the Friday before the event we collected\nthe shock absorbers and proceeded to piece the\ncar's suspension back together. Oh, and we had\nto refit the oil cooler, wire in new spotlights, re-house the washer bottle r mechanism and so on.\nAt 2.30am on Saturday, we discovered the\nback left suspension mountings weren't working\nat all and fought with the car until 5.30am before\ngrabbing some sleep. At 8.30am we started\nagain and by 10.15am managed to get the car\nfinished. We got to Cambridge at 11.05am, one\nminute after our start time on the table-top rally.\nAt first glance the navigation clues were nigh\non impossible, a situation which wasn't helped\nby lack of sleep or food.

The name? Leonardo Society\n(or LeoSoc for short). The purpose? To give you\nthe scientist a chance to discover you the artist.\nAnd if you've already done that, then why not\ncontinue to nurture that side of you here on\ncampus?\nOur activities presently include organising\ndrawing and painting classes. These classes are\nsupervised by students from the Royal College\nof Arts. No, no arts lectures, they are there to\nhelp you find out how much you can do!\nDifferent things are done in each session in\naccordance with what people like and what the\nhand brake turns quite challenging to execute!\nThings started looking up once the rear brakes\nbedded themselves in, but the hardest part of this\nevent wasn't controlling the car, it was\nremembering which route to take through the\ntraffic cones. The organisers, in their infinite\nwisdom, decided not to mark the various routes\non the course. Instead they gave all competitors\na photocopy of the plan for the dozen or so\nroutes and expected them to memo rise them.\nThis proved fairly difficult and Chris finished\nfifth.\nWe were now lying in joint fourth place\noverall with a crew from Edinburgh University\nMotor Club. At this point we were so tired we\nwere having trouble seeing straight, so caught a couple of hour's sleep before heading off\nsuitably refreshed to the start of the road rally.\nAt 11.38pm we roared off into the country\nlanes and were doing fairly well when white\nsmoke started to pour from the rear of the car. At\nthe next Time Control we got out to find the\nback right brake disc glowing bright red - the\nhand brake had jammed on. Loosening a nut\nseemed to fix it, so we set off again, trying (not\nvery successfully) to avoid using the hand brake at any tight bends. The car then decided to belch\npetrol vapour into the passenger compartment,\nso we opened the windows and told ourselves it\nwasn't really that cold, even if it was snowing.\nArriving at the halfway break we found we\nteacher has planned. We have two teachers, one\nfor each session.\nWhen? We have two weekly sessions:\nMondays 6-8pm and Wednesdays 2-4pm in the\nCivil Engineering department, rm 101.\nHow much? Membership costs \u00a32 students,\n\u00a34 non-students. Each session costs \u00a32.\nMaterials? Paper will be provided. We're\nproviding different materials for you to try first\nand then buy whatever you like. These include\nacrylics, chalk pastels and charcoals.\nSo why not give it a try. Just turn up and see\nwhat the classes are like and give us a chance to\nmeet you and hear your questions and your\nsuggestions!\nwere the first student crew in, so after filling\nourselves and the car up with various liquids we\nset off feeling much happier than we had done\nearlier. The navigation clues, which define the\nrally route, became much tougher in the second\nhalf. As a result we went off route, costing us\nvaluable time. Everything was going well, then\nabout a mile from the finish we had what is\ncalled in motor sport jargon a 'moment'.\nWe were going at a velocity approaching\nthree figures when the ignition switch blew,\nrendering the engine and the lights inoperative.\nThis wouldn't be much of a problem in a well lit\ncity street but in the dead of night down an un lit country lane it meant we couldn't see a great\ndeal. Thankfully, Chris managed to stop us\nwithout hitting any trees or ditches and after\nrewiring the ignition switch we got to the finish\ninside our maximum allowed time.\nAt the end we came second on the road rally,\nmoving us into second place overall in the\nchampionship, which we were fairly pleased\nwith, all things considered!\nIf you like the sound of this kind of stuff then\neither come to our Club night (see College diary\nsection in Felix) or pop along to the C&GC U Office, Level 3, Mechanical Engineering, any\nlunchtime and ask to speak to a member of the\nMotor Club or leave your name and department.\nIt doesn't matter if you don't have a car as you\ncan use the Motor Club's Mini on some events,\nThe Committee:\nMehul Khimasia\nPhysics UG3, e mail: mm l.k him asia@ ic\nAngela Darekar\nPhysics UG2, e mail: aa.dare kar@ ic\nHuma Islam\nComputing UG2, e mail: hj i@ doc.ic\nOla Al Deeb\nComputing UG2 e mail: oya@doc.ic\nYoon Yong ISE UG2 e. mail: y ky@ doc.ic\nand Painting with Leonardo Soc\nThe deadline for Clubs & Societies entries is 6pm, Friday\n\n"

    "content": "Feature 5\nHunting the Great Bright Sparks\nA word of explanation before unleashing this\nupon you. For the bat eyed, the Bohemians did\nexist; in a poster propagating capacity targeting\nour own Sherfield Walkway. Apart from one\nmessage, seemingly directed at our reporter,\nthey have been rather quieter this term.\nMyself and others wondered who they were,\nalthough most people probably hadn't even\nnoticed their A4 de marked presence. It wasn't their message I was interested in - it was them.\nWho were these people who seeked to add\nintellectual colour to the Imperial landscape ? In\na college whose populace is so often decried as\nape the tic, who were these oddballs who could\nbe bothered? The reporter came back with this.\nDo we believe him? Me, maybe I have to...\n- Owain, Features Editor\nThe Bohemians seemed to be an anomaly, a group who did no more than plaster the Sherfield\nWalkway with their obscure posters. Few\nremembered them for more than those glancing\nseconds that their distracted eyes caught sight of\nthe posters. There were however a few hardy\nsouls who lingered. For them, the tiny\nsub scripted name acted like a beacon, a holy\ngrail. Those people wanted to know more. I had\nnot been one of them, but somehow I was into\nthe web of secrets and darkness that was The\nBohemians. It all started one alcohol sodden\nnight in the FELiX office.\nThe topics wandered vaguely in the usual\ntired manner of late night discussions until it\nstumbled upon that name, The Bohemians. They\nwanted an investigator and somehow I was\nhired. It seemed like a dead end job. I had no\nclues, no leads except fading memories of\nmeaningless posters.\n\"OPEN YOUR EYES\", commanded the first.\nThere then followed an ultra pretentious blitz of\nalmost blank sheets, each one graced by the\nname of some grand obscurity. More posters\nappeared and passed unnoticed, and then just\nbefore Christmas, 'Awareness'. The attached art\npostcards didn't last long, trampled underfoot or\ntaken to adorn beds it walls.\nI was left with only one option. For nights\nwithout end I loitered in the Siberian winds of\nthe Walkway, lacerated by the wind and\nwreathed in nicotine smoke. Whatever crazy\nson of a bitch designed that sky high pavement\nsure knew how to control the weather; the wind\nup there was always gale force, regardless of the\natmosphere in the real world.\nThree times I waited amongst the fluttering\nposters, kicking at the tumbleweed bundles of\ndead publicity that wrapped themselves around\nmy ankles. The task was hopeless, beyond the\nstage of being a subject for drunken\nexistentialism. Then it happened! I saw a figure\nmoving through the darkness. Some freaked out\nparamilitary in balaclava and jet black fatigues,\narmed with a fistful of posters. He plastered\nevery wall in seconds flat. I was mes meri sed by\nhis professionalism.\nWhen I came to my senses it was too late to\ngive chase but I ran anyway, my coat billowing\nout behind me in the gale. The terrorist vanished\namongst the taxis on Exhibition Road. I kicked\nmyself for missing my only opportunity, then\nwalked back to the posters. My jaw dropped\nwith shock when I read them.\n'WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE'.\nShit. Underneath that Big Brother boast was a greater shock, a coded message, beginning with\nmy initials. Back in the bustling FELiX office\nwe tried to disentangle the random letters which\nmight be my only path to the Bohemians. It had\nto be somebody who knew my game, but I had\ntold no one about my investigation. That left\nonly the FELiX journ os themselves...or me? The\naccusations rang out for an hour, each denial\nseen as a bluff, each bluff seen as a counter\nbluff. Nobody dared to solve the code, for fear\nof accusation. The atmosphere in that office was\nmore tense than the worst of the McCarthyist\nwitch hunts. The code: h fdd a gc ago( let).\nThe answer eventually came late one night\nwhen my mind ran backwards - it was a telephone number. The obviousness of it hit me\nlike a ton of the proverbial bricks.\nI dialled the next morning, my heart\npumping. A thousand possibilities were silenced\nby the click on the phone. It was a recorded\nmessage: \"Tomorrow night, twenty one thirty,\ntwelve Neston Street, be...\" - my hand dashed\nswiftly to write down the address, dropping the\nreceiver with a crash. I rang back, but there was\nsilence on the other end. Weird.\nAgain in the FELiX office the suspicions\nemerged. Some, it seemed, thought that it was\nall a fantasy from my warped mind, but they\nweren't the ones who heard the message. They\nweren't the ones hounded by Twilight Zone\nposters. They even offered to go to Neston Street\nwith me just to make sure it wasn'ta big joke.\nNeston Street. A back street off a back street\namongst the dark alleys of Rotherhithe, a place\nso Dickensian that I expected to meet aMr Twimblewidget. The clacking of my boots on\nthe paving echoed off the charred brick of burnt\nout buildings in the eerie silence. I soon found\nnumber 11. A flight of steps led down beneath a sign: The Heart. The picture was gruesome, a sick parody of a pub sign. I descended, whistling\ninane tunes from The Wizard of Oz.\nThe heat, the noise, the sweat, all hit me at\nonce. Where I expected a damp basement lit by a40 watt glow, I had found a throbbing club:\nsomehow the noise hadn't dared to venture past\nthe door. The room was full of 'individual'\ntypes, the sort who like to think that they think\nfor themselves and aren't swayed by the herd\nmentality. A waiter approached, pointing to a table near the back. They had been expecting\nme, it seemed. There were five of them, one\nfemale. Who were they?\nDescartes, Plato, Zeno, Wittgenstein... ho ho\nho, so they name themselves after dead\nphilosophers. Hadn't that been done before? Oh\nyes, those turtles who were named after famous\nrenaissance pizzas. It seemed these weren't your\nusual poetry reading at dawn, \"actually I found\nthese shoes on the street\" type of long hair\nbohemian, but something more Neo, more\nQuasi. These dudes were sharp dressers, all\nangles and edges, their faces honed with power\ntool precision. I looked at them silently and a drink landed by my hand, with a bill.\nIndividuality doesn't come cheap these days.\n\"What's it all about?\", I asked. I lit up, and\nthey opened up. Plato started to rant.\n\"Ever heard of the Art Concepts Group?\nThey wanted to play with the world, to create a modern day myth, to sculpt reality rather than\nstone. A subversive group who may or may not\nexist. They pulled weird stunts here and there,\nbut nobody noticed. So they went further.\nStarted claiming responsibility for other things -thefts, bombs, hijackings. It became quite a scam\nfor a while, they even got a mention on\n'Newsnight'. But it went wrong. Somebody got\nhurt, killed, I think. Anyway they had to vanish.\"\n\"So what's that got to do with you?\"\n\"Nothing. I just wanted to clear the air. I didn't want you drawing any parallels. You\njourn os are fond of conspiracy theories.\"\nI chewed at the bill, asked them more about\nthemselves, but was hit by subtle evasiveness. I never even noticed when they directed the\nconversation onto other subjects. Another drink\nlanded by my hand.\nThe atmosphere of The Heart started to seep\nthrough my reality and the importance of my\nquest drifted into the cold night outside. I began\nto feel the buzz in the place. It was the buzz of\nreal intelligence, working minds! Conversations\nturned to discussions, to arguments. At one point\nsomebody even leapt onto a table to deliver a complex tirade! The drinks arrived, the empty\nglasses were removed, and the waiters forgot\nabout the bills which littered the tables. I slowly\nbegan to understand the Bohemians and why\nthey did what they did. As the night wore on into\nthe squawking birdsong of early morning\neverything made sense.\nMy friends, you want to know more about the\nfabled Bohemians! How they found me, or why\nthey care about Jaques Derrida? Well, I'm afraid\nI can't tell you. You see, what happened was\ninevitable really. I joined them. So if you are\nwandering the walkway late at night and see a shady figure in a greatcoat, it will be me. Out\nbill sticking for the Bohemians.\n\"Random\" 1641\nThis week's Cat's Tale is on page 18\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews 15\n\"Whoever Saves one Life, Saves the World Entire\" - The Talmud\nSchindler's List\nStarring: Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\nI feel dwarfed by this film. Here I might claim\nkinship with Spielberg. Imagine undertaking the\nportrayal of even the tiniest detail from the vast\nand unrelenting landscape of the Holocaust.\nThis was probably why it took him ten years\nto finally make Schindler's List: not because he\nsensed his need to mature but because he was\nscared. Fascist revisionism seeks to bleach the\npast with its white stained fictions; the\ncontroversy over restoring sites like Auschwitz\nrages angrily through Europe and Israel. David\nIrving and his nazi ilk could conceivably claim\nthat the 'lie' continues and this film is its latest\nincarnation. I myself have no problem with\nquestioning the past - for that reason I think\nSchindler's List is a triumph. The idiots swayed\nby revisionism question nothing; simply hearing\nwhat they like. But for each new generation the\npast is ever older and the question they must\nanswer isn't 'did it happen?' but 'how could it?'.\nHow is this achieved? Principly, through the\nportrayal of individuals. This three hour black\nand white epic explores the Holocaust by\nconcentrating on one man, Oskar Schindler. A German industrialist and war profiteer, he used a displaced and desperate Jewish workforce in his\nfactory, where they were well-treated and safe\nfrom the work camps. But the Nazis' 'final\nsolution' forced Schindler to play a dangerous\ngame. He sought to save his staff by bribing the\nNazis to transport them to a new factory in his\nhome town. He had allowed himself to see the\nJews as people, to love them.\nThis is shown most forcefully in a scene from\nthe liquidation of a work camp - the survivors\nhave been packed into train carriages to\nAuschwitz and in the sweltering heat the\nGerman officials dine by the rail side, sweating\nI1\ns11 A Bronx Tale\nStarring: Robert De Niro, Chazz Palminteri\nDirector: Robert De Niro\nA strange cookie this, so overlaid en with\nunnecessary pathos. Robert De Niro looms large,\ndirecting debut and still acting too. But in both\ncases he is largely anonymous. The byline reads:\n\"A devoted father battles local crime boss for the\nlife of his son.\" Baloney. That's just the facade.\nIn fact, this film has as many inconsistencies as\nDe Niro had bullet holes in 'Godfather 2'.\nThere's also jumps in continuity, airbrushed\nviolence, simple moral ising, and yet this remains\na hugely satisfying film.\nDe Niro plays a hard working Italianand swearing at the sun. Schindler, breaking\nunder the sight before him, arranges for the\ncarriages to be liberally hosed down, yet must\nact as if his motives were commendably sadistic.\nIt is a euphoric moment, even in its despair,\n(they will still die) because one man dares to\nstand against the many, banded together to\nbecome less than men, a kind of anti-synergy.\nStill more important is Speilberg's treatment\nof the Jews. As they line up en masse for\nclassification, their typed names appear on\nscreen. Again and again, little vignettes of\npeople, faces in the crowd, trying to live and\ndying. A breathtaking moment: Spielberg shows\nmass chaos as the ghetto is 'cleansed', at the\nsame time one small girl is picked out in red.\nThe message: the many are made of ones.\nMelodrama is nonexistent, the film is almost\ncold and the effect is claustrophobic. I say cold\nbut the film is speckled with humourous\nwarmth. This is deliberate; one cannot help\nsmiling as a boy searches for a hiding place and\nis continually thwarted by others in residence.\nHe jumps down a latrine and even there dwell\nthree children, picked out in a pool of light. He\nAmerican bus driver on the near side of the\ntracks, trying to bring up his son Calogero\nproperly. But Calogero is drawn to the shiny\nhoods, crackling money and a surrogate father in\nthe figure of local big boss, Sonny.\nThe ever-present violence is more than petty\nbut is somehow embraced in a way which limits\nits effect. It can still be sickening, as when a group of Hell's Angels are bloodied and torn in\nslow motion to the swagger of the Beatles'\n'Come Together'. \"Hey come on flat top he goes\ngrooving up slowly...\" as noses fall and baseball\nbats bluster; then everyone gets up and walks\naching ly away. Smells like the A Team are back\nin town. Even the climactic racial scenes are\ndiluted by an all-the-lads-together feeling. It's not portrayed as nasty and murderous, just the\nover zealous idealism of youth.\nstands outside them. \"You're not with us.\" Mob\nhorror again. Cold as life is. Emotion comes\nfrom within us, the world is black and white.\nColour enters a packed train carriage as the\ncamera pulls in from the outside world to the\noccupants (their colour, their life), then it pans\nback outside to grey.\nTraditional rant? Liam Neeson is\nunobtrusively convincing, Ralph Fiennes a detestable evil as the sadistic Goeth, Ben\nKingley's Itzak Stern a heartbreaking\npragmatist's hero; every one of the cast performs\nadmirably. The movie is technically flawless.\nSpielberg uses his past to create an ugly first\nhour, Schindler dancing and entertaining and\nthen the music's turned off and Goeth is\nshooting people for fun from his villa. Spielberg\nenters unknown territory and maps it expertly. It\ntakes a modern directorial master to stomp over\nthe Art School and take this, the twentieth\ncentury's principle lesson, to its pupils. It will\nwin Oscars. It may save lives. Possibly the\ngreatest film ever made.\nOwain Bennallack\nOn general release today.\nThe direction is swift and steady, maybe\nslightly overplayed in places but there are some\nexcellent laughs. Music is the canvass on which\nscenes are laid: the film's stuffed full of\nauthentic Do-Wop, played whenever there's no\ndialogue, and all together it works. Maybe the\nsecret is that De Niro resists going for a Spike\nLee shot at filming racial ghettos.\nAt the end, this could be anyone's story.\nThat's why the film is good. I don't need to\nidentify with Calogero, or the problems of the\nBronx in the early 60's. It's a film which doesn't need to be big, heavy and scary, and is only\nslightly flawed by being all three at some point.\nIt can just be an act, part of a modern\nstoryteller's tradition, ok...just a bronx tale.\nTintin\nOn general release today\nNext Week: Decca's series of music banned by the Nazis\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nMaking Sense of Nons\nHow do you live in a world gone mad? How do you justify the 'Theatre of the\nAbsurd'? Is the fight still on, or was it always, ridiculously, over?\nWhere can you run from the plays of Samuel Beckett?\nWhat would a critic of the late twenty first\ncentury think of the theatre of the twentieth?\nWhat would it tell her about us, our times and\nour view of ourselves? What to make of a century that produced both Cole Porter and\nBertolt Brecht, both Ray Cooney and Samuel\nBeckett?\nIf we look behind us, back to the Europe of\nthe nineteenth century, we sense, in many of the\nworks of that time and place, a feeling of\noptimism, a faith in progress and in humanity's perfect i bil it y. We're exhilarated by it, although\nwe're forced, jaundiced as we've become, to see\nit as naive. What message are we transmitting to\nposterity through our drama? What emotions,\nwhat concerns will the audiences of the future\nperceive in the plays of our age?\nOur century has seen old certainties crumble\nin the face of brutality on a scale that was\nun dreamt of by even the most pessimistic\nVictorian. In the two European wars which went\non to tear the whole world apart, the culture of\nthis continent invented, developed and perfected\nits latest gift to the culture of the world:\nindustrialised murder; efficiency in the cause of\ninsanity. The West, so long convinced of its\nsuperiority in all things, has been forced to look\nupon its demons. Nothing in the culture has\nescaped the effect, least of all our theatre.\nWe have no earnest, morally serious,\nuplifting plays to offer posterity. We no longer\neven bother to mock plays like that, as Oscar\nWilde did; they are irrelevant to us except as\namusing period pieces. Instead, our playwrights\nhave been faced with this stark choice: confront\nthe abyss or ignore it.\nMany have opted for the latter; above\neverything else, ours is the age of the Theatre of\nEscape. Spectacular musicals and bawdy farces\nhave come to dominate the great theatres of the\nWest's major cities, as we desperately strive to\nforget who, and what, we've become. The best\nplaywrights of our century, however, have\nlooked the Medusa in the face. Instead of being\nturned to stone, they have been animated by the\nexperience.\nSome, like Brecht, have responded by\nseeking to politic is e the theatre, to use it as a vehicle for ideology. Others, like O 'Neill, have\nbeen moved to write plays of crushing bleakness\nand pessimism, discarding even traditional\ntragedy's dimension of redemption and hope.\nBut the collapse of our culture's self-confidence\nhas inspired a more intriguing response than\neither of these. A small group of post-war\nplaywrights - not so much a group, really, as a number of maverick individuals - have chosen\nto use drama as a way of embodying our\nuncertainty: of celebrating it, even. This\nmovement, if that's what it is, has been dubbed\nthe Theatre of the Absurd. Its High Priest, if it\ncan have such a thing, is the French-Rumanian\nplaywright Eugene Ionesco.\nBorn in 1912 into an Eastern Europe about to\nbe devastated by war and later naturalised as a citizen of France (whose suffering in the First\nWar was as great and whose moral dilemma\nduring the Second was unique), Ionesco is\nperfectly placed to be a commentator on\nanything. Nothing could be further from the\ndidactic ponti fi cations of, say, a Brecht than\nIonesco's disturbing, hilarious forays into pure\nun reason. His plays throw us directly into his\nvision of the human predicament in an age that\nhas lost its faith in both God and Man.\nIonesco's Exit the King, DramSoc's production of which is scheduled in March, is a very funny play. Its humour is anarchic, surreal,\nirrational, bizarre. It's concerned with a man's inexorable, predictable, frighteningly rapid\ndescent towards death, but it's no less funny for\nthat. In fact, that's where the humour comes\nfrom. Ionesco takes one central idea - that in our\nfaithless age, I can't be sure that all of reality\nisn't an illusion that will vanish when I die - and\nfollows it remorselessly, hilariously, to its\nlogical (yet profoundly illogical) conclusion.\nBut it would be wrong, it would be selling\nlone sco short, to represent Exit the King as\nnothing but a piece of surreal go one ry,a sort of\nRumano-French Monty Python and the Holy\nGrail. This is also - and there's no contradiction\nhere - a disturbing, emotionally violent play. It's comic because it's tragic, and vice versa.\nExit the King is being intensively rehearsed\nby a small, committed, thoughtful cast with\nmyself, as nominal director, acting as a conduit\nfor the group's ideas. If we do this fine play\njustice, and we ought to, then the production\npromises to be a bit special.\nThere's no doubt that our critic of the future\nwill see Exit the King, and the rest of Ionesco's work, as one of our culture's most important\nartifacts. What she'll deduce from it about this\nage, and about us who live in it, is harder to say:\nwhat can you make of people like us, who have\nbeen driven to seek their enlightenment in\nnonsense?\nPhil Ramsden\nGot a problem? See if Min has an answer for it on page 6\n\n"

A fleeting glance behind the Iron Curtain - a glance that reveals some of the many secret\nworkings of the ex-Soviet Union.\nAn intricate network of multiple rounds of\nhuman betrayal expertly woven to share with\nthe outside world the un publicised realities of\nthe Cold War. It is being implied that many\ngovernments are guilty of anonymous roles in\nfuelling the Communism that they were\napparently trying to put an end to. A number of\nstartling facts and even more chilling\npossibilities are captured by Tim Sebastian.\nVery aptly titled Last Rights, the book\nfollows the life of an Englishman born of\nRussian parents whose roots reach deeper than\nhe could have every imagined. An Englishman\nuntil his parents' past catches up with him, he is\nforced to choose between \"the death of a principle and the life of a human being\".

Is it\nan unfortunate coincidence or a conspiracy? As\nthe FBI investigation begins, a law student,\nDarby Shaw develops her own theory.\nThe Pelican Brief, as it becomes known is\npassed to the FBI by her boyfriend and Law\nProfessor, Thomas Callaham. Within days of the\ndocument being read in Washington, she\nsurvives a car bomb that kills her boyfriend and\nshe is forced to go on the run. While evading\nher unknown pursuers, she attempts to unravel\nthe conspiracy.\nThis book is excellent. The plot initially\nmoves along slowly as the characters are\ndeveloped, but the momentum rapidly builds\nuntil you are totally absorbed by the plot. Don't delay, buy it and read it today! John Grisham is\nalso the author of The Firm and The Pelican\nBrief will be released as a film on 25th February.\nBlodwin\nPublished by: Arrow\nPrice: \u00a34.99\nAnother travel book is not immediately what\nsprings to mind as the greatest need of modern\nliterature, although it ranks higher than Judith\nKrantz's 'Scruples 2' I suppose. There is always\nthe possibility of being patronising when you are\nthe writer who can describe over 200 years of a country's history in a little over twenty three\npages and still make it home in time for tea. Iyer\nseems to make his job harder by operating under\nthe subtitle 'Some Lonely Places Of The\nWorld', as he encompasses his eight choices.\nThe list, for completion, is: North Korea,\nArgentina, Cuba, Iceland, Bhutan, Vietnam,\nParaguay and finally Australia. All-in-all this is\na wide ranging bunch and perhaps that's part of\nhis problem. They are just too diverse; my front\nroom can be quite lonely on occasions, too. You\nget the feeling that the solitary journalist\npacking around the globe is never too far from\nmaudlin friendless ness. Despite all this, Iyer's writing style is\nunconventional enough to make a book, albeit a light weight one, out of his experiences. The\nArgentinean chapter is a good example. He\nDifferent people have different ideas of Utopia.\nThe Status Civilization, set mainly upon the\nplanet Omega, could be considered as one such\nidea, if you are, or have the viewpoint of, a rather nasty, highly trained ninja who has\nseveral gold medals for sharp shooting and a penchant for general killing. The ideals of the\nsociety are clear. Kill or be killed. With each\nkill, your social status increases (and the number\nof people interested in your demise rises\nproportionally).\nThe first few chapters were muddled and\ngenerally confusing but once over these initial\nhurdles the story unfurls its wings and flies on\nfaster and faster, dragging you along with it.\nHowever, as you near the end, the dragon-like\nnovella pauses before finally smacking you hard\nwith its 'tail'. It is the sort of book which, once\nfinished and put down, leaves you thinking hard.\nWitty, containing several new ideas and\ngenerally a good read.\nconcentrates on the still strong polo driven\naristocrats who live in a decaying opulence of\n100% inflation and consider themselves too\ngood, even for Europe. Yet Argentina has been\ncovered before by such writers as V.S. Naipaul,\nas Iyer himself recognises, and the feeling\ncomes on strong that he is acting as an app et is er to more weightier tomes. Similarly Vietnam,\nCuba and North Korea are not exactly virgin\nground.\nFor the lonely, Iceland's pallid streets appear\nto be the best. Not only for the violent mood\nswings induced by the varying seasons, nor the\nthousand years of Nordic inversion, just the\nchilly silence of a wasteland. As Douglas Adams\ncould have written, there is one chapter in the\nNatural History of Iceland called, 'Concerning\nSnakes'. In its entirety it says,\"There are no\nsnakes to be met throughout the whole island\".\nMostly harmless, except for the bite of gentle\nirony.\nTintin\nPublished by: Black Swan\nPrice: \u00a35.99\nAnd now to the second story in the book,\nMindswap. I remember being taught that a story\nshould have a beginning, a middle and an end.\nMindswap seems to consist of all three, but in no\nparticular order. The story is that a homeboy\nwants to travel, so he swaps his mind with that\nof an alien for what he thinks will be a short\nholiday. The alien then disappears with his\nbody. Naturally, the hero wants his body back\nand so chases the alien across space,\nmind swapping several times on the way. The\nstory chops and changes like a fly going from A to B, never following one course for too long\nbefore turning in a totally new direction. It was\nhard to follow and the ending fizzled out like a wet firework. After the first story which showed\nthe author's talent, Mindswap is poor.\nGinster\nPublished by: Legend\nPrice: \u00a34.99\nThe Status Civilization /\nMindswap\nby Robert Sheckley\nSample Italian delights on page 11\n\n"

But\nDrugstore had enough kicks for two.\nYou could see the gleam of ambition about\nthe way they just cracked into the opening\nnumbers. No banter, that comes with\ncomplacency. Between songs, Isabel swigged\ndeeply from a bottle of vitriolic red which\nremained at her feet. As fronts piece she is faintly\nexotic, fairly tiny and with a growl like a Monday morning.\nIntoxication kicks into the audience, some of\nwhom even begin to nods their heads. That's more movement than will be generated later.\nDrugstore are a band who still want to play, who\nfeel like they're doing something being on stage.\nThey wanna be stars, they will get their wish.\nThe Red House Painters cry through me in\nmy fogging bathroom mirror, sulking and\nmouthing to the torture of recognition - I don't want to see Koscelik banter with the crowd.

    "content": "22 Opinion\nEditorial\nI could write volumes about the letter on the\nopposite page entitled 'Media Virus', but I will\ntry to keep my response as brief as possible.\nThe media virus campaign seems to be the\nreason behind Gareth Davies writing the letter.\nWhen he brought the article in, it was not made\nclear to me that it was an article to be printed in\nthat form; I thought it was more for my in form a tion. When I looked at it, it was over a page of\nsolid text and I was not prepared to cut two\npages from the current edition of Felix in favour\nof something which had been brought in after\nthe deadline and about which I knew nothing. I did ask other people about this campaign and\neveryone I spoke to had heard nothing, despite\nthe supposed extensive national media coverage.\nI then handed the article to the Felix news team\nwho spent some time researching it and who\nthen reported on (see page 2 of this edition).\nMr Davies claims that my failure to print\nanything on the campaign has stopped every\nstudents at Imperial College from participating\nand he asks what right I have to do this. Now,\ncorrect me if I'm wrong, but I was elected as the\nFelix Editor. I think this gives me the right to\nchoose what goes into an issue and what doesn't.I don't believe that by not printing an article\npeople are prevented from participating in a campaign.\nThere are other ways of getting messages\nacross to the students. If you are relying on a page long article to inspire people to phone up\nrandom organisations and rant on about student\nissues, then I think you have been mislead.\nPeople need direction and enthusiasm from\nsomeone. They will very rarely do something off\ntheir own back. Someone (maybe you, Gareth)\nshould be out there organising it, leafleting the\nJCR and the Union, talking to people and getting\nthem motivated; getting the support of the Union\nwould be a start. They have a lot more power\nthan some people realise. Andy Wensley feels\nthat this isn't the best way of tackling the\nproblem. If he could be convinced, then he could\nuse his influence to maybe get some phones\nbrought in as has happened in Birmingham. Who\nknows?\nBut instead of going out and doing things,\nGareth decided to complain about Felix. The\npoints he raises are ones that come up time and\ntime again, so once and for all, I 'll try to set the\nrecord straight on some of them.\nDeadlines. These are set for a reason. It is\nnot, as Gareth seems to think, because it takes us\nfour days to typeset a page. It is in fact because\nFelix is printed over three days, beginning on\nTuesday. We therefore need sufficient pages\ncompleted by Tuesday morning. While it may\nnot take long to lay out a page, there are things\nlike the typing in of the articles (thank you for\nbeing so thoughtful and bringing your letter in\non a disk, Gareth), proofing the page, correcting\nthe mistakes, dot screening photographs and so\non. All this takes time and as much as possible is\ndone by students who have other time commitments such as their courses.\nThe main deadline is set at Friday to give\nmyself the time over the weekend to sort out the\npage plan and decide what needs to be done by\nwhom and by when. I do not believe that setting\nthis deadline means I am sacrificing the quality\nof the issue for the quality of the presentation.\nHowever, I think presentation a very important.\nIf something looks bad, no-one is going to\nbother to even pick it up. People are reading\nFelix at the moment, every copy is picked up\nand there are people complaining that there\naren't enough copies in some departments. I doubt that someone is going around picking\nthem up and putting them straight in the bin.\nAnother point raised in Gareth's letter is that\nof the content. Felix is a student newspaper, we\ncan't deny that. It relies on students to write and\nproduce it. It is also a society within ICU. It is\nthere to give students a chance to try something\ndifferent, something they haven't had a chance\nto do before. We aren't there just for the\nstudents, we are there for ourselves, too. This\nmay sound selfish, but like I said, we are a society, too.\nIn order to get people involved, we include\nreviews in the paper. It is an age old complaint\nthat there are too many reviews in Felix.\nReviewing gets people involved. It gives them a chance to try something new. Felix needs volunteers and a lot of them are reviewers. The\nreviews may be subjective opinions as Gareth\nsays and you may prefer to read reviews in the\n'professional weekly periodicals', but they are\nall opinions. Are the opinions of someone who\nwrites for Time Out any better than those of our\npeers? A lot of the reviewers writing for Felix\nknow a hell of a lot about what they write about\nand are, in my opinion more than qualified to\nwrite a review.\nI could continue to comment on the letter and I have a lot more I could say, but space and time\nare running out. If anyone else has questions or\ncomments, perhaps they can write to Felix and\nI 'll explain it to them. The deadline for letters is\nMonday, 6pm. The reason for this is to give people a chance\nto comment on the issue that comes out on the\npreceding Friday. If a letter is brought in late, it\nwill be fitted in if there is the space. If they\ninclude arrogant statements like \"Your image in\nthe eyes of the students will be defined by the\neffort you make to print this.\" I will not be\ninclined to make the effort.\nSabbatical Election Candidates\nYou can place advertisements in Felix for the issues coming out on Friday 4th March and Friday 11th March. Please ask in the Felix Office for more details.\nAdverts are accepted on a first come first served basis.\nThe deadline for booking election publicity print work with the Print Unit is today.\nBookings made any later cannot be guaranteed to be completed by Friday, 6pm.

Whilst it may\nseem a big job, there is a lot of time to do it in.\nand the work you do over the summer is paid.\nYou have to gather and write material, search\nfor advertising revenue, chase clubs and\nsocieties for submissions, collect photographic\nmaterial, the full monte really. You are\nresponsible for the creation of the Handbook\nfrom the conceptual ideas, all the way to where\nit goes out in the post to all of next year's new\nstudents.\nSounds interesting? To stand, sign up outside\nthe Union Office. You need a proposer and ten\nsecond ers. Come into the Union Office and ask\nfor details if you want to know more. Also, if\nyou want, get the view of one of the past editors,\nspeak to Beccy, the Felix Editor. Pop into the\nFelix Office, Beit Quad and ask her for her\nviews.\nSo, How Do I Vote?\nThe Election\nPapers Are Up\nIf you are interested in or are going to stand for\na sabbatical post, you have until next Friday,\n25th February, to get yourself proposed and\nseconded. Remember that the papers are\nopposite the Union Office, 1st Floor, Union\nBuilding.\nWhen you go to sign up, make sure you get a copy of the election rules and publicity\nprocedures. Remember, you cannot put up any\npublicity until the papers come down. If anyone\nwants any more information about a particular\npost, talk to the rel event sabbatical.\nFirst things first, you need your swipe card. No\nswipe card? Is your swipe card knacker ed? Well,\nyou can get a new one from Security in the\nSherfield building. In past years, Union cards\nwere punched to show that you voted (and to\nstop you voting twice); this year we're using\nswipe cards.\nThose kind people in Security have come up\nwith a read-write machine which electronically\nmarks your swipe card to show that you have\nvoted. Don't worry, it won't show how you\nvoted, the machine merely 'tags' the card to\nensure you cannot vote twice, just like\nphysically punching a hole. This system is a lot\ntighter and less prone to abuse than punching\nholes in Union cards.\nSo if you haven't got a swipe card, get it\nreplaced now. If you've gone on to a new course\nand your card says that it has expired, don't worry. If your card is still working, the machine\ncan tell so.\nRemember, when you go to vote, you're\nname is checked off against the student register\nto make sure you are eligible to vote. If you are\na student at Imperial College, you're on that\nregister, so don't worry.\nUNION GENERAL MEETING\nFriday February 25th Union Ents Lounge\nDeadline for Motions:\nToday, Friday 18th( Motions to be handed into the Union Office,6 pm) "

    "content": "News 3\nElection Campaign Fever!\nBY ANDREW TSENG\nRumour and gossip are rife this\nweek in Imperial College Union\n(ICU) as this year's sabbatical elections get underway.\nThe election papers, which were\nposted on Monday, have been the\nfocus of intense interest. Five candidates are presently standing for the\nfour sabbatical posts. Others are\nrumoured to be testing the waters\nbefore committing themselves.\nAt the time of going to press the\ndeclared candidates were: Kamran\nBashir, Lucy Chottia, Paul Thomas,\nOwain Bennallack and Timothy\nBrown.\nAmidst a climate of what some\nconsider bad leadership, the post of\nPresident has been subject to the\nmost speculation. Three people\nhave already announced their candidature. Paul Thomas, U GM Chair\nand last year's President of the\nRoyal College of Science Union\n(RCSU), is proposed by ex-President, Chris Davidson. Like the\ncurrent President, he comes from\nthe Maths Department. His\ncompetitors reflect the Union's higher profile amongst clubs and\nsocieties. Kamran Bashir, the\nParachute Club Chairman is\nproposed by Naresh Mistry. Lucy\nChottia, a chemistry student,\npresently stands un proposed. She is\nthe Third World First treasurer.\nThough not yet officially\ndeclared, Rhian Picton and Dave\nCohen are said to be interested in\nthe Presidency. Some have said that\nMs Picton's Presidency of the\nRCSU this year, in addition to her\nyear as the Biochemistry\nDepartmental Representative would\nmake her a strong candidate.\nSimilarly, Mr Cohen would be\nexpected to put up a good fight\nhaving been IC Radio Station\nManager last year and a resident in\nSouthside for three years.\nThe Deputy Presidencies are\ncurrently uncontested. Timothy\nBrown, Social Clubs Committee\n(SCC) Treasurer, proposed by this\nyear's SCC Chairman, is standing\nunopposed for the post of Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services). Noone has announced their candidature for job of Deputy President\n(Clubs & Societies). However, it is\nrumoured that Ian Parish, former\nAero Soc Chairman and present\nGuilds' Departmental Societies\nChairman, may decide to stand\nbefore nominations are closed.\nLast year's election for the post\nof Felix Editor & Print Unit\nManager saw an occasionally\nunpleasant contest after which\nseveral of the Felix team left. To\ndate, only one person is standing:\nOwain Bennallack, Felix Features\nEditor. He is proposed by Jon\nJordan, Music Editor and fully\nseconded. Joe McFadden, the\nCinema Editor, has also declared\nhis interest in running for the post.\nBoth students have been heavily\ncommitted to Felix for the last year.\nThe campaigning will begin\nonce the papers come down on the\n25th of February. The voting will\ntake place in all departments on\nMonday 14th and Tuesday 15th March. The results should be\nknown on the Tuesday evening.\nAll four sabbatical posts are of\ncourse being contested by New\nElection. You should vote for this\nif you feel no candidate is suitable\nfor the job.\nMonkey\nBusiness\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nA new national poster campaign\nhas been launched to protest against\nexperimentation on animals. The\nBritish Union for the Abolition of\nVivisection ( BU AV) is targeting\nthe Barbados tourist industry at the\nheight of the holiday booking\nseason.\nThe aim of the campaign,\nlaunched on Tuesday, is to press\nthe island's Government into stopping the export of wild monkeys\nfor laboratory experiments. The\nposters feature contrasting images\nof a tropical beach and a group of\ncaged baby monkeys. The slogan is\nsimple: \"Barbados - you won't want to leave and neither do they.\"\nLeaflets are to be distributed\nlocally and public awareness events\nwill be held outside travel agents.\n50,000 protest postcards are also\nbeing targeted at the Barbados\nBoard of Tourism.\nFRESH HAIR SALON the best student offer in london!

The women's team came\nsecond after George's and the men's was also\nsecond after UCL.\nThe most remarkable performance on our\nteam was Stephanie Summers', who finished as\nthe best female individual swimmer. She\nimpressed everyone when she won the 110 yards\nbackstroke with a big lead over her opponents.\nOf the men's team, James Ralph finished as\nthe second best male individual swimmer.\nThursday's gala was followed by a short\nreception after which the IC team went on to\nconsume cast amounts of Sangria, a custom that\nhad already been introduced on Monday.\nIn all, it was a damn good laugh.

This was done\ncompletely unsupported, pulling all their\nsupplies on fibreglass pul ks( sleds). As well as\nthe tortuous physical battle they endured, a limited scientific programme was also\ncompleted as well as filming for American\ntelevision.\nThis should be particularly interesting for\nthose fond of the polar regions, mountaineering\nand hill walking. Anyone who has attempted the\nPennine Way or West Highland Way should be\nable to sym pathis e with the task they undertook!\nThe lecture will take place in the Pippard\nLecture Theatre, 5th floor, Sherfield Building at\n6pm and is free to members, \u00a31 for non\nmembers or \u00a32.50 for lecture and membership\n(available on the door).\nFurther details from the Chairman, David\nEdwards, Management III.\nGod, Sex, Death\nSex is a sensational subject people like to read\nabout. When Simon Hughes MP came to\nCollege on 24th January, he opened his talk\nentitled Christianity and Politics by suggesting\nthat he could have given a press release\nrevealing he was speaking to ICU Methodist\nSociety about God, Sex and Politics. Without\nactually changing the content of what he had to\nsay, he would have thus caught the attention of\nmost of Britain's tabloid readership.\nSimon Hughes, Liberal Democrat member\nfor Bermondsey, had recently supported\nchanging the age of consent for homo and\nheterosexuals to 17 and described how, more\noften than not, his faith supports the decisions he\nhas to make. Among the list of positions he\nholds within his party, Simon is Deputy Whip\nand spokesperson for the Church of England. He\nstimulated much thought and questioning;\nmention of the recent political sex scandals was\nonly part of a very entertaining evening with us.\nICU MethSoc now invites you to tackle the\nsubject of sex on a more serious level. On\nMonday 21st February at 6pm, Rev. John Cooke\nwill be speaking about God, Sex and DeathThe Challenge of AIDS.\nRev. Cooke is currently Superintendent\nMinister of the Hammersmith and Fulham\nCircuit of the Methodist Church, but dedicates a lot of his time to the challenge he will be talking\nabout. As a Methodist, he was well known last\nyear for having proposed the resolution to the\nAnnual Methodist Conference affirming the\npresence of homosexual people in the ministry.\nHis work with HIV and AIDS is far more\nwidespread and has included spending time on\nFull of immature humour, in your face visuals\nand animated sex, Heavy Metal was something\nof a Fantasia for the '80s. Animated SF films\nused to be rare, especially ones with such artistic\ntalent behind them. The film grew out of the\ncomic/magazine of the same name, renowned\nfor its stunning artwork, over-the-top sex and\neven the occasional intelligent storyline, and\ncertainly lives up to its pedigree. Visually\noutrageous with mind blowing animation and a rock soundtrack featuring the diverse talents of\nBlack Sabbath, Trust, Sammy Hagar, Blue\nOyster Cult and many more, Heavy Metal is a very amusing little film. It starts at 6pm in Chem\nEngL Tl. Next up at 7.45pm is Repo Man, Alex Cox's anarchic and very funny SF satire. Emilio\nEstevez stars as Otto, a street punk drawn into\nthe strange and dangerous world of car\nrepossession chasing a lobo tomis ed scientist\nwith radioactive aliens in the boot of his Chevy\nand desperately trying to get a blow-job off his\ngirlfriend. Both videos are free to ICSF\nmembers and members of RockSoc. You will\nhave the chance to join Rocksoc and find out\nmore about what they do at both films.\nand Politics\nsabbatical in Zimbabwe, Zambia and San\nFrancisco researching how the church is\nresponding to the AIDS crisis. He is involved\nwith pastoral care of those living with the virus\nand is a trustee of CAR A( Care and Resources\nfor people with AIDS and HIV) and sits on the\nManagement Committee of London Churches'\nHIV/AIDS Trust.\nHaving been University Chaplain at\nLancaster and Nottingham, the evening promises\nto be an informative occasion for both students\nand staff and everyone is warmly welcome. It is\nbeing held on Monday 21st February at 6pm in\nthe office of the West London Chaplaincy, 10\nPrince's Gardens. Our banner outside will make\nit obvious where to go!\nThere are a few other events which may be of\ninterest and again everyone is welcome. On\nSaturday 26th February at Hinde Street\nMethodist Church, W l, we have helped to\norganise a day of seminars and workshops (from\n12pm4 pm) entitled Christians and Muslims in\nContemporary Britain. It is being led by Rev.\nMartin Forward, MA, MLitt, FRAS, who is well\ninformed on the subject and keen to build\nbridges with our friends of different faiths\naround us. Light refreshments will be served\nfrom 11.30am, but there are over twenty pubs in\nthe area to enjoy afterwards if necessary!\nOne other Monday night meeting to look\nforward to is on March 7th, when Susan\nHowdle, President of the Methodist Conference,\nwill be speaking. We meet every Monday at\n6pm in the Chaplaincy Office. If you want any\nfurther information, don't hesitate to contact\nJohn Salmon (Maths UG2).\nMembership costs just \u00a33 and gets you free\nentry to our full programme of video double-bills, the chance to borrow over 3000 books,\nvideos and graphic novels from our library in the\ncorner of Beit Quad and reduced entry to our\n35mm presentations, including your first film\nfree.\nOn Tuesday we present at 6pm in the STOIC\nStudio (on the top floor of the Union Building)\nthe Special Edition of James Cameron's the\nAbyss along with The Making of the Abyss.\nWeighing in at just under three hours, this cut\nincludes more character is ation early on in the\nfilm and also provides a reason for the\nunderwater aliens' presence on Earth along with\nsome staggering new tidal wave footage. The\nprospect of a three hour film may be daunting,\nbut thanks to Cameron's extreme sense for\naction pacing and razor dialogue the story\nhammers along relentlessly with taut editing and\npowerful set pieces. The Making Of was only\navailable with the now sold-out boxed set, so\ncome and find out exactly how they did do that\nwater tentacle.\nAdmission is free to ICSF members with\nmembership details given above.\nDribblers\nIC 2, CXWMS 1\nKnowing that our position in the league table\nwould be unaffected by the result, the Ladies'\nFootball team went into this match without the\npressure of previous matches.\nThe first play of the match saw a beautifully\nworked move in the midfield ending with a cross from Chris on the left wing and a superb\nfinish by Juliette. A few minutes later Jennifer\nshowed some impressive footwork going\nthrough several midfielders before playing the\nball to Chris for what turned out to be almost an\nexact duplication of the previous goal.\nFive minutes into the match and up two\ngoals, IC began to relax. Charing Cross used\nthis moment of weakness in the IC defence to\ntheir advantage and brought the score to 2-1.\nRealising a lot could happen in the next 80\nminutes, IC settled down and played one of our\nbest matches yet. The forward line of Tamara,\nJulianna and Jennifer kept the CX goalkeeper\nunder pressure. Some magnificent runs by the\nmidfielders, Maryam, Juliette and Chris, meant\nthe CX defence were constantly under attack.\nOur own line of defence, Sally, Jane, Paula\nand Laura, kept the other end of the pitch under\ncontrol with some impressive sliding tackles by\nPaula saving us from any real threat.\nHalf-time saw Michelle coming on to the\nforward line. A tactical switch moving Julianna\nto her normal position as sweeper and Jane to\nthe forward line meant IC dominated the half.\nA special mention for Sarah who played an\noutstanding match as goalkeeper (in Linda's absence) and Jennifer who made her debut for\nIC by taking out the captain - unfortunately it\nwas our captain not theirs'.\nYou've seen the posters, now read the article on page 5\n\n"
