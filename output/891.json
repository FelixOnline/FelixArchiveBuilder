    "content": "FEATURES\nAmnesty International investigates different countries' attitudes towards drug offences.\nAddicted to Killing\n'I'm ready for execution. I already saw\nthe gallows being tested,' said the sailor.\nHis wrists were handcuffed as he spoke.\nOutside the jail a group of journalists kept\nvigil.\nNext morning at 6.02am he was dead,\none hour later than the usual schedule for\nthe execution of a condemned man in\nMalaysia. His hanging had been held up\nas a special concession so that he could\nperform his last prayers at dawn\u2014the first\nof five a Muslim is obliged to perform\ndaily.\nThe 37 year-old seafarer, a native of\nIndonesia, died protesting his innocence.\nConvicted of possessing 937 grams of\nmarijuana and being a member of a drug\nsyndicate, he became the first prisoner in\n1990 to join Malaysia's ever-rising toll of\nthose executed in what officials now\nadmit is a lethal failure to stem the\ncountry's drug trade.\nMalaysia's anti-drug drive made\ninternational headlines in the early 1980s when the country's leaders made the\ndeath penalty mandatory in drug\noffences. Huge billboards warned local\ncitizens and foreign travellers: 'Be\nforewarned: Death for drug traffickers\nunder Malaysian law.' By June of this\nyear the national press reported that 104\nconvicts had been hanged on drug\ncharges since 1983 and a further 200\nwere waiting on death row.\nOne of over 20 countries have now\ntried using the death penalty for drug\noffences, Malaysia has become a crucible\nfor testing the effectiveness of the\npunishment as the ultimate antidote to\nnarcotics.\nThe statistics for addiction paint a grim\npicture. In 1970 only 711 addicts were\nidentified in the country. Two decades\nlater, in December 1989, the Home\nMinistry's Dadah (drugs) Treatment and\nRehabilitation Division had identified\n145,685 addicts throughout the country.\nNot only has the increase been\nstaggering, but it has continued regardless\nof the hangman. Two years after the\n1983 decision to make the death penalty\nmandatory for drug offences, the\ngovernment's figure for registered addicts\nstood at 102,807. Forteen months later it\nhad risen to 111,688. Two years later\u2014\nand with executions being enacted in a blaze of publicity against foreigners as\nwell as local citizens\u2014the addiction\nregister had gone up to 128,741, a steep\nrise of nearly 30 per cent over three\nyears.\nThe experiment had failed. But\nexecutions continue.\nA1989 report by the International\nNarcotics Control Board said that\nMalaysia was continuing to be affected by\ngrowing 'transit traffic' involving\nprimarily opium and heroin. Both were\nbeing smuggled across the country's northern border or through its western\ncoastline. The report noted, however, that\n'in trying to come to grips with the drug\nabuse and trafficking situation, the\ngovernment has made it clear that it will\nnot compromise in dealing with drug\noffenders, including foreigners.'\nOf the 104 reported executions, 25\nwere said to have been foreigners. These\nnow include Han Tsui Lin, one of eight\nHong Kong citizens executed on30 May\n1990 in the country's biggest mass\nexecution. She became the first foreign\nwoman to hang in Malaysia.\nVirtually every time a foreigner has\ncome up for execution, press interest has\nbeen intense and heads of government\nhave publicly and privately appealed to\nthe Malaysian authorities to show\nclemency. To date, the pleas have fallen\non deaf ears, and nationals of Australia,\nBritain, Indonesia, the Philippines,\nSingapore and Thailand have also been\nput to death.\nAmnesty International, the worldwide\nhuman rights organisation, has repeatedly\nurged the Malaysian authorities to stop\nthe killing. It has taken the same stand\nagainst the death penalty in all countries.\nIn a major report on the death penalty\nreleased a year ago, the organisation\nstates: 'The rationale for using the death\npenalty is that it will deter drug\ntraffickers more effectively than other\npunishments. But despite hundreds of\nexecutions there is no clear evidence of a decline in drug-trafficking which could be\nclearly attributed to the threat or use of\nthat penalty.'\nInternational experts agree. The lack of\ndeterrent effect was cited at the\nDecember 1985 meeting of the United\nNations Expert Group on Countermeasures to Drug Smuggling by Air and Sea. The'group's report stated:\nThe Electric Chair\u2014waiting for a victim.\nAMNESTY INTERNATIONAL PUBLICATIONS\nReports on Amnesty' s concerns in the following countries are now available. Please contact the Imperial College Group. Afghanistan Hong Kong Romania\nAustria Indonesia Saudi Arabia\nArgentina Iran Somalia\nBangladesh Jamaica S Africa\nBrazil Jordan Spain\nBurma (Myanmar) Kampuchea Sri Lanka\nChile Kenya Surriame\nChina Mexico Syria\nColumbia Morocco Turkey\nEast Timor Nepal Uganda\nEgypt Nicaragua UK\nEl Salvador Panama\nGuatemala Peru\nHaiti Philippines\nFEATURES\n'...in the experience of several experts,\nthe fact that capital punishment appeared\non the statute books as the maximum penalty did not necessarily deter\ntrafficking; indeed, in some cases it might\nmake prosecution more difficult because\ncourts of law were naturally inclined to\nrequire a much higher standard of proof\nwhen capital punishment was possible or\neven mandatory...The most effective\ndeterrent was assuredly the certainty of\ndetection and arrest.'\nIn the desperate battle against drugs,\nsuch evidence is often overlooked. In\nNovember 1988, the United States joined\nthe league of nations opting for\nexecutions as a weapon against the drug\ntrade. Federal Law now allows the\nimposition of the death penalty as an\noptional punishment for persons who intentionally kill or order killings while\ncommitting drug-related offences.\nBack in Malaysia, with its soaring\naddiction rate, officials are beginning to\nexpress doubts about the effectiveness of\nthe death penalty as a deterrent. In June\nthis year the Deputy Minister of Home\nAffairs said that the country's mandatory\ndeath penalty for drug trafficking had\nfailed to curb either the trade or drug\nabuse and that a new approach to the\nproblem was needed.\nIn a a paper presented at the national\nSeminar on Drugs Treatment and\nRehabilitation in Kuala Lumpur in July\n1990, the deputy director of the Criminal\nInvestigation Department's anti-narcotics\nforce said the mandatory death sentence\nhad not shown signs of achieving its role\nas a deterrent in the six years since its\nenforcement. Instead, the number of\npeople detained for trafficking and\nincreased those detained were usually\nreplaced by other traffickers within a short time.\nHe said: 'Our intelligence shows that\npeople were found to be trafficking dada h( drugs) even when a member of their\nfamily had been detained and awaiting\ntrial.'\nINTERESTED?\nThe Imperial College Amnesty\nInternational group is\nparticipating in a worldwide\ncampaign against the use of the\ndeath penalty for drug related\ncrimes. To take part, turn up to\none of our weekly meetings or\nsign a letter on Thursday\nlunchtime in the JCR.\n12 13\n\n"

    "content": "Imperial Announces New\nScience park at Duffryn:\nScale 1:25,000\nA new science park is to be developed in\nSouth Wales. The park, situated in\nNewport, will be developed jointly by\nImperial College, the Welsh Development\nAgency and Newport Borough Council.\nConstruction work is expected to start\non the 40 acre site this summer. The first\nphase will involve the building of a \u00a32\nmillion technology centre, to be called\n'Imperial House'. This will house high-technology companies, and is to be\nmanaged by Imperial College. Imperial\nalready have experience in managing the\nscience park at the Silwood Park\noutstation.\nThe rector, Sir Eric Ash, said he was\ndelighted to have this opportunity of\nwidening Imperial's collaboration with\nindustry, through the availability of such\na magnificent site in Newport.\nThe collaborators hope that high-tech\ncompanies will base themselves around\nthe science park, where they will have\naccess to the academic resources of the\ncollege in London. To enable this,\ncommunication links are to be installed,\nproviding voice, data and video links.\nNewport Council hope that eventual\ninvestment in the new development will\nexceed \u00a3100 million, with associated\nregional job creation. They expect the\nname of Imperial College to act as a magnet to draw in both national and\ninternational companies to the site. The\npark will make Newport one of the\nleading sites of commercial research in\nBritain.\nThe Secretary of State for Wales, David\nHunt, said: 'This is marvellous news and\nwill give a tremendous boost to the\nWelsh economy. This project is yet\nanother example of partnership in action.'\nDuring the period 1989/90 the college\nreceived \u00a339 million in income for\nresearch projects conducted on behalf of\nindustry and government departments.\nSports Centre Refund Rethink\nThe sports centre have altered the new\nlockers recently installed in the changing\nrooms. The lOp required to operate the\nlockers is now returnable. A student\ncommented 'they've come to their senses\nagain'. A spokesman at the sports centre\nconfirmed that all the lockers had been\nconverted, but would not say why they\nhad reversed their previous decision.\nIn a letter to the manager of the Sports\nCentre, Dr Ken Bignell of the Space &\nAtmospheric Physics.Group, said that the\nnew lockers were unsatisfactory in\nseveral respects. They have no shelf to\nallow the separation of shoes and clothes.\nThe doors are sprung so that the doors\nreturn to the closed position, thus making\nthem awkward to use. The open shelf\nthat was at the base of the old lockers\nhas now gone, so, apart from the floor,\nthere is nowhere to put wet or dirty\nitems while changing. His key complaint,\nregarding the non-returnable lOp deposit,\nhas now been rectified.\n2\n\n"

    "content": "Editorial\nAnother week, and I'm almost beginning\nto get used to this. The hardest part (no,\nI'm not going to use the same joke I 've\nused for the last two weeks) is deciding\nhow to start. Once that's over with, it's easy. So, here we go...\nVICTORY!!! (Provisionally)\nYes, it looks like we've done it! In an\nuncharacteristic burst of sanity the\nWorking Party on the College Day have\ndecided that the 'jolly sensible really'\nproposals to alter the length of the day\nweren't quite so sensible after all.\nAccording to El Presidente (Shan), the\ndecision was apparently made due to the\n'...strength of student opinion...' and that\nthe departments of College (not just\nacademic ones) which had been keen on\nthe idea hadn't justified why they were.\n(Interesting, eh?).\nThe Working Party report to the Board\nof Studies, and are thus drafting a paper\nwhich contains their findings (apparently\nthere were some) and a list of the pros\nand cons associated with the proposals.\nShan told me the list of cons would be,\nwell, rather long, to say the least, which I must say comes as a huge surprise to\nme...\nUnfortunately, the next meeting of the\nBoS is too soon for the paper to have\nbeen completed, so a letter will be sent in\nthe interim, expressing the Working Parties view that 'We strongly\nrecommend that no changes are made to\nthe College day for the foreseeable\nfuture.'. This will be followed by the\npaper at the first meeting next term.\nAll is not sunshine and roses in happy\nbunny land, however. The Working Party, being a committee, has no power\nin itself: It acts as an advisor to the BoS.\nThe BoS, though, has no power either\n(it's a committee), so it advises His\nRectorness. He then makes the decision,\nas He's got power (He's the Rector, you\nsee).\nRight, what this means is that at any\nstage along the way the advice of the\nWorking Party could be ignored. Aren't bureaucracies a good idea. Of course, this\nwould be slightly more mad than Mad Jack Mc Mad, winner of last years\nMaddest Man in Britain competition. But...\nAlso, the College's interpretation of the\nphrase '...for the foreseeable future.' is\nabout three years, which as a pure\ncoincidence happens to be just enough\ntime for most of the current student\npopulation to have left. The words\n'sneaky', 'clever', and 'sly', while being on\nmy mind at the moment, have no bearing\non my opinion of this. Honest.\nBut, all that aside, it's still a victory for\nus as students. It shows that if we can\nrise above the rabid apathy that appears\nto be an inherent part of IC, then we can\nchange things. It might also show College\nthat they can't do what the hell they like,\nwithout considering what we think about\nit.\nWho?\nThe 'Real Man' saga continues. I have\nreceived the letter from Angus Fraser\nthat I mentioned last week, but\nunfortunately he clearly marked the\nenvelope as 'confidential' and the letter\nitself as 'Personal'. In English, this means\nthat it would be a bit off for me to print\nit without his permission. Suffice it to say\nthat it expressed, quite strongly, a similar\nview to that expressed in last week's letters page. But tough, I still stand by my views as expressed last week.\nThis week's letters page has held these\nviews up, especially my feeling that\ncontrary to the opinions expressed in last\nweek's letters page, ie that the 'real man' letter could not 'enhance or enliven' Felix\nin any way, in fact it could. E.g. the two\nletters from ' A Real Woman', which are\nfrom two separate people, by the way.\nHowever, this is not what I want to talk\nabout. It's just that these letters have\nbrought to light an interesting\nphenomena (he says, sounding like a scientist for the first time in his life): How people assume the sex of a person from\ntheir opinions. For example, most people\nhave assumed that the 'Real Man' letter\nwas written by a man. Most people who\nhave read the 'Real Woman' letters have\nassumed they were from a woman. Alan 'my favourite person in the whole\nuniverse, and I really do think his view\npoints are so sensible' Bailey assumed\nthat 'Pendragon' was a woman( he's a man - Adam Tinworth, the Arts Editor, in\nfact). Several people have held varying\nopinions as to the gender of 'Athena'.\nReligion, God, etc\nWhat are these guys/gals on? While I try\nhard to respect and understand the\nopinions or beliefs of others, the amount\nof letters we've had from various\nChristians has taken it's toll.\nAs far as I'm concerned, if someone\nwants to accept that by believing in a semi-mythical figure from the past of the\nMiddle East, then their souls will be\nredeemed, that's fine by me. It gives\npeople strength and hope, and allows\nthem an external figure to turn to for\nthese. All well and good. But really, when\nthey act as if they're beyond criticism,\nthat they're always right, and that\neveryone who doesn't believe is either\n(a) Wrong( b) Mislead\n(c) Immoral\n(d) Evil\n(e) In need of converting\nOr any combination of the above, that\nit really starts to get on my nerves. A belief is yours. No matter how many\npeople also share your belief, it doesn't mean that everyone should. It also\nAS F Bit\ndoesn't mean it's 'right'. Specific moral\njudgments of 'right' and 'wrong' only exist\nwithin the framework of a specific set of\nmoral values. Each and every person has\ntheir own set, dictated by a huge number\nof factors. Each human society has its\nown set, in the from of both laws and\n'unwritten rules'. Each religion has its\nown set.\nThis is all fine by me. Just don't start\nassuming that everybody should live by\nyours. And for whoever s sake, don't use\nthe Bible as if it were fact: It's just a book! If you believe it's true, fine. But\nyou can't use it as the basis of an\nargument with someone who doesn't believe it's true, when you can't prove it\nis. In the same situation, you can't judge\nsomebody by it. Some 'morals' have to be\naccepted by everybody: Laws. This is\nnecessary for our society to function in\nthe manner which it does, and to\nmaintain it. If you don't agree with them,\nfine, but you'll suffer the consequences.\nOutside this, it's up to you.\nCarrie Miller: If you want to see\nabortion as wrong due to your religious\nbelief, that's up to you. However, the fact\nis that some people will not share your\nbelief, and the practical fact is that\nwomen will always have abortions. If\nyour religion leads you to think that\nabortion should be banned, and thus that\nwomen who wish one should have to go\nto a potentially unqualified person and\nrisk the consequences, then maybe you\nshould rethink your concepts of mercy\nand compassion (which Christians seem\nfond to extol).\nDavid Fernandez-Arias: If Athena\nwishes to question your moral\nframework, and you can't answer his/her\nquestions, then don't write in telling\nAthena that all he/she has to do is\nbecome a Christian and he/she won't worry about it anymore. Please.\nSo if you don't have a constructive\npoint to make (ie not 'God is really cool'\nor 'I'm right 'cos I believe' or 'This is\nimmoral because my religion tells me so')\nI really don't want to hear about it.

    "content": "Tanita Tikaram\nThe Apples\n\u2014Eye Wonder 12\"\nThere's a really sexy sample buried in\nthis record I could almost kill for. It\nsounds like Prince on acid and it goes\n'Heyyyeyyeah' and the rest of the song\nrotates around it. (I 'll insert it several\ntimes just to give you the feel for it.)\nPrince's influence appears more than\nonce, this time in the guitar department -you know the one - 7 Just want your\nextra time and your (nicked guitar line) ...\nkiss!'\nAll this occurs in the first five seconds\nof every mix on this 12\", but how does\nthe rest of the song go? Well, to be fair,\nit heads in a different direction to the\nPurple One's funk workouts and it has a few other blips, bleeps, scratches and\nsamples to bounce it on its way. There is\nan original song here, but it sounds like\nit's obeying the given formula somewhat,\n(hey ye y yeah etc.)\nThe vocalist sounds familiar but I can't quite place him although he sounds a bit\nlike Barney from New order. The chorus\nconsists of more Heyyyeyyeah's and the\nsinger wondering if we love him several\nhundred times - and do we readers? Well,\nI think we do.\nHarry Cross\nPoppy Fields\n\u2014Drug House 12\"\nIf you're gonna write a song about drugs,\nnot only do you have to take them\nbeforehand, but you have to put a believable edge to the song. The Jesus\nand Mary Chain produced probably the\nbest drug gy song ever in 'Some Candy\nTalking' - they certainly were talking\nfrom experience and they also did it in a haze of feedback. Remember the incident\nwhen Mike Reid suddenly realised it was\nabout the 'D word' and went round the\nBBC like a headless chicken getting it\nbanned?\nThat's the sort of reaction the Poppy\nFields should be trying to achieve. They\nemploy an electro-beat and a nig gly guitar line that's hard to get out of your\nhead once you've heard it a couple of\ntimes but the indefinable magic isn't there. Maybe the song's too blatantly\ndrug gy, maybe it's that drug gy songs are\nto commonplace after the house\nrevolution (yeah!), maybe it's just to\naverage. Whatever the reason, Drug\nHouse doesn't make the grade.\nHarry Cross\n\u2014Everybody's Angel LP\nYou don't like Tanita Tikaram? You think\nshe's boring? Fine. If that is the case then\nyou probably won't much like this album\neither. If you're a real Tanita Ti karam freak then you're going to buy the album\nwhatever I say. So, who amI talking to?\nThis is aimed at those of you who\nbought one, or both, of her previous\nalbums, and figure that you have enough\nof her work, or haven't bought any, and\nare slightly interested in her music.\nSo, what's the album like? Tanita's songwriting ability has improved; she\nmanages to produce a greater variety of\nsongs than on either of her two previous\nalbums (Ancient Heart, The Sweet\nKeeper). Tanita now also has a better\ncontrol over her voice, giving her a wider\nrange of tones to cope with her now\nwider range of styles.\nBasically, she's improving, in writing\nand performance, and if she were to quit\nthe music business right now, this is the\nalbum she should be remembered for; it's the best so far. Want to know any more?\nBuy the album.\nStef\nSpacemen 3 -Big City 12\"\nAll sounds on this tape are produced on\nan unmodified guitar with an E bow,\nexcept of course the percussion. Oh wow man, let's get stoned.\nSpacemen 3...from their drunken haze\nto discover a tune before dragging it\ndown with them again.\nThe official effects are well...trip py. This\ntime the vinyl is one up on the CD.\nJust when you think you have floated\naway there is another chord to remind\nyou you're still at home on the planet\nmoron. You need something to keep your\nmind unoccupied when listening to this\nlong track.\nWe didn't listen to the B side as we had\nfloated away on purple clouds in a trance\nat Drive.\nThe Oh Wow Man.\nRevolting Cocks\nThursday night and the Robey moved to\ncentral London. Every traveller, drop-out,\nhardcore freak and a few more besides\nwere there to see The Revolting Cocks\nand they were in for a treat.\nGodflesh opened, their merciless grind\nbeating an already packed Astoria into\nsubmission. Despite some technical\nhitches the duo, sometimes augmented by\nan extra guitarist, still managed to sound\nlike mountains moving.\nNext up were Bomb Everything, who\nseemed to be moving towards a more\ncommercial sound. Still crap though!\nTame expectation awaited the Cocks,\nwho all of a sudden leapt onto the stage\nwith no ceremony, and after a brief\n\u2014Astoria 24.1.91\ncomment about the you know what\nlaunched straight into Beers, Steers and\nQueers. Tonight they were awesome, a total wipeout of sound that got the s hole dancefloor, and some of the balcony,\ndancing like those possessed.\nThe beats were merciless, but the dark\nedge to the music and its subject matter\nwas totally overshadowed by the\noutrageous Go-Go dancers who enter d after a few songs and pretty soon the\nwhole stage degenerated into a sort of\nstimulated orgy. God only knows how\nthe guitarist managed to keep playing.\n!f they're ever allowed to leave the\nasylum again everybody should be made\nto see The Revolting Cocks. A revelation.\n14\n\n"

Be there or be\nspanked senseless with a wet herring.\n20\nNot Again...\nDear Andy,\nOkay, so I feel challenged (or\nprovoked?) to put pen to paper in\nresponse to the second half of Athena's letter (who is Athena anyway? Doesn't(s) he have the courage to admit to\nhis/her own views?) and more specifically\nto the ranting s against the 'God Squad\nGuys' who wrote against abortion. I would like to put the record straight, and\n' say that it isn't just 'guys' who are against\nabortion, I am one of many women who\nalso believe that abortion is murder and\nhence very wrong.\n'But what would you do if you got\npregnant?' I hear you ask. My answer is\nthat you don't even have to run the\nslightest risk of getting pregnant before\nyou are ready. And that's without using\ncontraceptives or being frigid. Society has\nreduced the value of sex. It's fashionable\nand almost expected of you to sleep with\nsomeone (or even several people), in fact,\nif you're still a virgin, people begin to\nwonder what planet you've come from.\nSex has even been reduced to be used as\nan abusive swear word. Where's the\nrespect gone for one of life's greatest\npleasures? It's too easy to 'get laid', and\nthen it's too easy to dispose of the\n'evidence'. You know the saying, 'easy\ncome, easy go'.\nBut I believe that God has created each\none of us and so, following through with\nthat argument, I believe that it is His will\nif a tiny sperm impregnates a tiny egg,\nWho? Part 3\nDear Andy,\nConcerning 'A Real Man' article Issue\n889.\nPhoarr! Give him to me, the man of my\ndreams: A Real Man! I mean come on\ngir lies, we'd all love a quick shag with an\nIC piss head, especially when he says he\nloves you!\nYou get the scenario; a generous five\nseconds of foreplay and he's desperately\ntrying to get into your knickers. 'I love\nyou', he dribbles into your ear and of\ncourse you would believe him!\nMeanwhile, your previously immovable\n501 buttons mysteriously come undone.\nYou would have no hassle with me\nwhen it comes to putting rubber socks on\nyour knob. I'd never consider\ninconveniencing a Real Man with the\nburden of a condom, he must be hung\nlike a donkey if he splits condoms,\nafter all they wouldn't split for any other\nreason would they?\nAnd it's okay, you wouldn't catch any\nnasty diseases from me love y, the last 23\nguys I 've bon ke d swore they were clean\n(clean willies, hair...?) and of course I believed them. (Well I am an easy, dopey\nbitch after all and my sincere apologies,\nliberated as well!).\nstarting up the reproductive course. This\nmeans that every baby that is conceived,\nGod has created, so who are we to take\naway their lives.\nThen there's the argument of 'what if\nyou're raped?'. My answer is that, if only\nwe ask Him, God will give us the courage\nto go through with the birth, and then, if\nnecessary, offer him/her up for adoption.\nTwo wrongs don't make a right. It is far\neasier to live with nine months of shame,\nand be able to hand over a beautiful\nliving baby, than to hand over a dead\none and live with years of guilt and\nshame.\nI know that many women don't have\nthe faith (and courage?) that I have, and\nso I am not preaching cold hearted ly at\nthem, to make them change their views.\nBut I am concerned that sometimes they\nare offered no alternative to abortion. I have heard of several incidences where\nwomen have gone to the health centre\nhere in College and have been counselled\nonly for abortion with no offer of help or\nadvice to pursue the alternatives. Then\nafter their abortions, they have been\nabandoned by the NHS. Leaving some\nvery desperate and emotionally\nvulnerable women to search for help and\nsupport from people like the Samaratans\nor the church. So much for respecting\nwomen and their rights, eh?\nYours,\nCarrie Miller, Mech Eng 2.\nI'm not very fashion conscious either,\nso you're in luck because I'm on the pill,\nbut you'll have to excuse the fact I'm three stone overweight, frequently\nnauseous, jaundiced and tired all the time\nbecause I haven't found a pill my body\ncan handle yet.\nSo what about it Real Man, why don't you and me get together, you can use me\nand reject me in the morning. That is if\nyou privilege me with a shag, well it's a man's 'God given right' to shag and I suppose I should be thank full for anything\nI can get (i.e.a considerate piss head, over endowed with tally wacker and a wonderful sense of humour).\nYours,\nA Real Woman.\nP.S. It's strange how some people can't seem to understand different people don't find the same things amusing. Surprisingly\nenough opinions differ and who's to say\nwho's wrong. Afterall some people found\nthe Real Man letter funny, some people\nfound it offensive and I found the man of\nmy dreams!!\nErr... Deja vu?\nASF\n\n"

New members always welcome.\nDear Mr Felix Editor,\nWhy, oh why, oh why?\nWhy one: I thought that\ncorrespondence 'battles' had been banned\nfrom FELIX( due to previous experiences),\nso why the 'Athena vs El-Kholy'\nexchange?\nWhy two: Why do you insist on writing\nabout the CNS broadcasting network?\nWho are they? I 've heard of CNN and\nCBS\u2014or does FELIX have some sort of\nscoop regarding the merger of the two\naforementioned networks? (Same mistake\nin Issue 889 stop press, which turned out\nto be incorrect about the chemical\nwarhead statement anyway.)\nWhy three: I read the article about the\nrecent refurbishment of the Union Cafe\nand Games Room, with Shanley's comment that 'it's going really well'.\nWhat justification is there for this:\n-the pinball machine (if it can be called\nthat) is really shite and there is only one\nmachine, pinball was quite popular last\nyear as I recall, and this 'new' machine is\nnowhere near the same calibre as the\nreplaced machines;\n-the removal of the table football\nwould, I imagine, annoy some people,\nalthough the pool table replacement\nwould admittedly satisfy others...\n-...but how can someone play pool in\nthat room when shots are limited due to\nthe fact that the video machines obstruct\nplay;\n-these machines do not appear to be as\npopular as the Gauntlet/OutRun/Hero\nTurtle etc machines (although I suppose\nonly time will tell);\n-the carpet is jolly nice though, and I'm sure will be easy to clean when people\nspill their pints/guts, or drop fag ash etc\non it.\nSo, WHY!! Yours,\nC Maury (1SE II).\nWhy one: Sorry, they've never had a blanket ban. Specific 'battles' have been\nbanned in the past, but only if it was felt\nthat they were becoming boring and/or\nlapsing into personal insults. So tough.\n(Besides, it's not just Ath vs El-Kholy...)\nWhy two: The mysterious 'CNS' is my\nfault, caused by stress- related mental\nregression (as well as just being thick).\nAnd by the way, all the information\ncontained in the 'Stop Press' was taken\nfrom the BBC world service, and the\nquotes used were actual quotes from\nreporters at the scene. It was pointed out\nthat the Pentagon denied any reports of\nchemical weapons ten minutes after the\nstatement which was quoted in the article.\nBut why do you believe them?\nWhy three: You really should tell Ben\nTurner this, not us. But the machines are\nmuch more modern, I played pool the\nother day with no problems from the\nmachines, and the pinball is being\nchanged.\nAlien Sex Fiend\nGod's Right Hand\nDear Athena,\nIn the last edition of FELIX you\nexpressed a desire for a reply from socalled 'eternal life' religions (point 5).\nAs a 'born again' Christian (is there any\nother kind?) I can pass on to you what\nGod has given to the world in the Bible\nand pray that its truth cuts deep into the\nhearts of people who really desire to\nknow how to fill the empty ness inside\nthem.\nGod's way to heaven and eternal life is\nnot by being a really nice person only. In\nEphesians 2v v8&9 we read:\n'For it is by grace you have been\nsaved, through faith\u2014and this not from\nyourselves, it is the gift of God\u2014not by\nworks, so that no one can boast.'\nWhat's this guy on about, you ask?\nFaith in what? Romans 3v22: 'This righteousness from God comes\nthrough faith in Jesus Christ to all who\nbelieve...for all have sinned and fall short\nof the glory of God and are justified\nfreely by his grace through the\nredemption that came by Christ Jesus.'\nSo why is this Jesus blok e anything\nspecial? John 14v9: 'Anyone who has seen me has seen the\nFather.' John 14v6: 'Jesus answered, T am\nthe way, the truth and the life. No one\ncomes to the Father except through me.'\nIn other words, we're guilty of\ndisobedience of God's instructions (sin)\nand that separates us from Him, however\nhad we tried to pull ourselves out of this\nhole we've dug for ourselves. But then\nHe gives us a way out! He sends His only\nson, Jesus Christ, into human existence\nand being God and perfect in every way\nHe is the only way that the penalty for\nour disobedience can be paid for us, by\nsacrificing himself and being cut-off from\nthe Father, carrying the weight of our\nsins. But, through this act, Jesus has\nconquered death, rising on the third day\nand showing that the kingdom of God\nhad arrived and Satan is fighting a lost\nbattle. Now that's what I call real love!\nNo longer separated but adopted into\nHis family forever. Then comes those\nfantastic promises\u2014'This righteousness...to\n18\n\n"

    "content": "Michael Newman examines humanist values and gives another\nview of...\nLife and Death\nLast Sunday the 'Everyman' programme\non BBC1 broadcast the story of the death\nof a young woman from leukaemia. It\nmovingly showed the support she\nreceived from her family and the help\ngiven to them by a Humanist counsellor.\nIt is often a surprise to people to find out\nthat those who have rejected faith in God\nare contributing to social and moral,\nwelfare explicit ely within a framework of\nnon-belief, that is as humanists. In\ncountries like Holland humanists are on\nequal terms with theistic religions in\nterms of their contributions to the care of\npeople within society. Sadly in this\ncountry the law and government funding\ndo not allow such parity.\nHumanists are unfairly discriminated\nagainst, as if their beliefs are still not\nrecognised as respectable. One American\nbook, Your Quest for God by RA Bennett, actually states, 'In our day Satan\ncontinues his nasty work through the\ndeceptive teachings of secular humanism',\nand a member of the House of Lords\nduring the 1988 Education Debate\ndeclared that if you do not believe in God\nyou could have no values!\nThe British Humanist Association is\nfighting for its counsellors to be\nrecognised as 'spiritual' advisers with the\nsame visiting rights as clergymen in HM prisons. It is also fighting against insidious\ncampaigns of Christians like Baroness Cox who want to force their religion onto our\nchildren as a part of a moral campaign.\nShe managed to get passed an *\namendment to the Education Act forcing\nChristian worship on school children,\nunless the school or individual child opt\nout! this was done during a late sitting of\nthe Lords, with few members being\npresent. Most secondary schools in this\ncountry are probably, very deliberately,\nbreaking that law! Indeed Humanists are\non over twenty-five Local Education\nAuthority committees that advise schools\non religious education and worship. In\none, in London, the Humanist has been\nelected as its chairman!\nHumanists have a history of social\ncontribution to our society. They have, at\nthe cost of their own freedoms and\nmoney, fought for the freedom of speech\nand belief. A humanist housing\nassociation owns over one thousand\nproperties in this country in which it\nhouses the needy and elderly. There was\na humanist adoption agency to break the\nmonopoly the church once had over who\nwas allowed to be adoptive parents. They\ncampaign in parliament on moral issues\nsuch as abortion, pre-embryo research,\neuthanasia and capital punishment.\nWhilst the anti-abortion lobby were\nsending plastic models of foetuses to MPs\nthe British Humanist Association was\nsending them a leaflet that examined the\nmoral issues, this received praise from the\nNew Scientist and various professional\nmedical groups.\nBut some of their most important work\nis done on an individual basis within our\ncommunities. These include humanist\nceremonies. Humanist weddings and\nfunerals go back to the last century.\nNehru, the first Indian prime minister,\nstated in his will that he wanted a funeral\nwith no mention of God. A copy of this\ndocument along with an essay on his\nthought about religion can be obtained\nfrom the Huxley Society books tall( Friday\nlunchtimes in the JCR). Indeed the\ndemand for ceremonies has increased so\nmuch that trained humanist celebrants, or\nofficiants, who conduct the ceremonies on\nbehalf of the families, could not cope with\nthe numbers. Two books have been\npublished which encourage families to\nconduct their own ceremonies. The\nauthor of these, Jane Wynne Willson,\nchairwoman of the British Humanist\nAssociation, will be talking about them\nthis Thursday (see What's On).\nHumanist funerals are a celebration of\nthe life that has just ended. Instead of a sermon (in many of our churches\nnormally irrelevant to the life of the\nperson who has died), the family listens\nto a short speech that describes the\ndeceased and significant moments in their\nlife. The family either write parts of the\naddress or are interviewed by the\nofficia nt. In both cases, the bereaved are\nable to share their loss, and turn this into\na personal statement that is shared\ntogether at the ceremony. Some families\nread pieces of favourite poetry and listen\nto the deceased's favourite music.\nThe first funeral I conducted was of a man who was much loved by his family\nand those who came to know him. It was\na well-attended funeral. My speech was\nwritten for me by the daughter-in-law,\nexcept for my introductory and\nconcluding remarks which gave\nsignificance to the importance of\nremembering and learning from the lives\nof those we love. It was the first funeral I have been to where people laughed, they\nlaughed together not at cheap jokes but\nat shared memories of humourous times\nthey had had together. The man had\nbeen a DIY enthusiast constructing his\nown shed which fell down on him,\nknocking him out. Tears mixed with\nlaughter, both giving public expression to\na shared warmth and respect. This is one\nway humanists express their attitude to\nlife. That day, having the honour of\nexpressing their memories of him to his\nfamily, I felt exhilarated with life.\nTragically some people fail to\nunderstand the nature of these funerals.\nA clergyman in Belfast was campaigning\nlast year to prevent them from taking\nplace in city cemeteries or crematoria.\nSomehow he felt they were offensive.\nLast year, the mother of a young man\nwho died from AIDS, held up the funeral\nfor six months by contesting his will in\nwhich he stated that he wanted a humanist funeral. They argued that he\nwas not mentally competent when\nmaking the will, and that his atheism was\nnot genuine. He had been a member of\nthe National Secular Society for nearly\nthirteen years, and an atheist for many\nmore. His mother was a born-again\nChristian who believed AIDS to be\nsatanic. The funeral was well attended\nwith his friends but no member of his\nfamily turned up.\nHumanist weddings are a public\ncelebration of the love of a couple,\nwhether they are heterosexual,\nhomosexual or lesbian. The promises\nmade between the couple are realistic\nand normally show a philosophy of\nequal ness, respect and sharing. The\ncouple write their own ceremony,\nchoosing the venue and music. It\nbecomes an event that is personal to\nthem and their family. Sadly humanists\nare second class citizens where the law\napplies to weddings, they still have to\nregister at the Registrar's Office, though\nEdwina Currie, before her resignation,\nstarted changes that will allow couples to\nmarry and register in places other than\nthose of regular worship or council\noffices.\nMichael Newman.\n\n"

    "content": "Havana\nLondon Symphony Orchestra &\nChorus and Southend Boys Choir\nHavana (directed by Sydney\nPollack) is set on the eve of 1959\nand the Castro's revolution.\nThe hedonism and decadence of the rich\nis about to give way to the sober realities\nof the impoverished. Jack Weil( Robert\nRedford) is the gambler who thinks that\nthe night before the revolution is the\nultimate time to make a big killing.\nHowever, he falls for Roberta Duran\n(Lena Olin, who won an Oscar for her\nrole in The Unbearable Lightness of\nBeing).\nRoberta Duran happens to be married\nto a committed revolutionary, who\nbelongs to one of the most wealthy and\npowerful families in Havana. Jack stakes\neverything on Roberta, thinking he has\nfound his lucky break in life\u2014however he\nis unable to understand why she has to\nbe involved in or committed to the\nrevolution. It is this contrast that Sydney\nPollack brings across most successfully in\nthe film. Whereas Jack has spent his life\ndrifting from one city to another, without\nany ties or bonds, almost lacking any\nvalues or vision, the woman he falls for\nin the end is his exact opposite. She has a cause.\nIn the final analysis, however, the film\nisn't held together very well: it rambles\non for almost 2\n>\n/\n2 hours. The lavish sets\nand locations are unable to detract from\nthe fact that Roberta and Jack don't actually make a very convincing couple,\nor that the politics of the revolution\n(expressed through Roberta) port aye d in\nthe film are very simplistic (though this\ncan be forgiven on the grounds that this\nis, after all, Hollywood romance).\nThe best performance in the film\nprobably comes from Alan Arkin's Joe\nVolpi\u2014the owner of the plush Lido\nCasino, playground of the wealthy about\nto lose it all. Joe can see the doom about\nto befall him and his clientele, but there\nis a grim acceptance in him which\nbecomes almost noble.\nBy the way, even if you don't see the\nfilm, you have to hear the soundtrack. It's hot.\nI.H. \u2014Concert\n\u2014 Film One could be forgiven for thinking\nthat in this performance conductor\n-Richard Hickox was indulging in a private joke at the expense of\nChristianity. Stravinsky's devout\nSymphony of Psalms was paired with\nOrff's setting of the irreverent irreligious\nmonastic poems found in Beuern in\nBavaria. In style as well, he contrasted\nand emphasised the brooding, serious\nnature of the Stravinsky with the joyous\nlust for life evident in Carmina Burana.\nThe Symphony of Psalms is scored for\nan unusual orchestra, consisting primarily\nof wind instruments and two pianos, and\ndoes not follow the standard symphonic\nform. The orchestra and chorus handled\nthe subtleties of the piece well and\nprovided an excellent contrast to the\nBarbican Hall, 6/1/91\nsecond half.\nHickox emphasised the power of\nCarmina Burana through ice-sharp singing\nfrom the chorus, particularly in the\ncentral passages of Fortuna Imperatrix\nMundi. Of the soloists, Donald Maxwell\nwas particularly outstanding, at times\nseeming to get carried away with the\nperformance, but always displaying the\nexcellence of the wide range of talents he\nis capable of.\nThis performance pulled the audience\nthrough the ranges of emotion and at\ntimes was too large even for the\nexpansive spaces of the Barbican Hall.\nThis is a performance that will long\nremain in the memory.\nLiz W. Kindergarten Cop\nBig Arnie is not the sort of person\nthat you ever really imagine as\nbeing out of their depth. John\nKimble (Guess who?) is not the sort of\nCop who you imagine ever being run all\nover by anyone. He's the sort of person\nwho breaks up parties with a BIG gun\nwhile declaring 'Next time, my place!',\nbefore threatening a witness into giving\nevidence. He's the sort of cop who can\ngo undercover anywhere safely. Except a primary school.\nWe've seen Arnold pitted against\neverything from invisible predators to\nLinda Hamilton's scream, and come out\nunscathed. For the first time he finds a group that he can't use an Uzi on.\nTwenty kicking, screaming, wetting and\ndisobedient toddlers. It's a brilliant idea.\nThe first twenty minutes plays like a straight Schwartzenegger movie, then we\nsuddenly find Our Hero hyper-ventilating\noutside a classroom. The sublime contrast\nof what we expect an Arnie character to\nbe, compared to what he is forced to\nbecome is the root of this comedy. It\nworks brilliantly!\nTwins proved that Arnie had the ability\nto be funny, and this film only serves to\nimpress me further with his abilities. Both\nas straight man to others (his partner, his\nheadmistress, his kids) and as a deliverer\nof gags in his own right, he turns in the\ngoods. He's allowed a love affair, that\nresults in some genuinely touching\nmoments, and his partner putting on an\nAustrian accent for the course of a meal\n(I ham h izzi zte r..).AND he only shoots\nthe one person.\nA pleasant s matter of all you would\nexpect in a film from Ivan (Ghostbusters)\nReitman. Violence, love and comedy. This\nis a good film. This is a wholesome film.\nThis is a funny film. To paraphrase the\nfilm...\nWhen it comes to the critic's test,\nKindergarten is the best...\nPen drago o. We would like to ap polo g is e for the\neffusiveness of this review. Pendragon is\nnow on a steady diet of George Elliot\nNovels (the big, boring ones) until he\nrecovers.\n\n"

    "content": "\u2022 Rocky HY our average 'Critic' (ie a person\nwho gets paid to slag films off) will\nprobably hate this. During the press\nshowing several of them gave perfect\nexamples of how to maintain objectivity\nand suppress innate prejudice. They did\nthis by ridiculing the film before it\nstarted, and then meeting several parts of\nit with derisive laughter (they hadn't seen\nit before: I asked).\nAnyway, enough of 'professional' critics.\nThis, the last (so we're told) of the Rocky\nseries continues immediately after the not\nso realistic Rocky IV. To give you a rough idea, Rocky returns to America to\nfind all his money gone due to a crooked\naccountant. He retires from boxing, sells\nhis mansion, car, motorbike, gloves, etc,\nto repay what debts he has, and moves\nto a run-down house in Philadelphia.\nThen he finds out that '...the continued\nheavy blows to the head...' have given\nhim partial brain damage, and to fight\nagain could cripple him (so it's a good job\nthat he's retired). There then follow\nvarious family and personal problems.\nMost of these are caused by a corrupt\nboxing promoter who wants Rocky to\nfight again.\nThen a young fighter called Tommy Gunn turns up, and persuades Rocky to\ntrain him. Gunn does very well, but is\nfinally tempted away by the money,\nwomen, and cars offered by the\naforementioned nasty promoter. He then\nfights for and wins the World Title. Due\nto some clever psychology the nasty\npromoter persuades him that to be\naccepted by the public he must fight\nH| What do you give the wife who has\n| everything? Valium. What do you\ncall a fear of valium?\nKlaus-tra phobia. Klaus von Bu low has been tried,\nsentenced and a quitted of the crime of\nattempted murder of his wife (with\nvalium\u2014see above). This is a true story.\nIt must be difficult to make a film about\na story in which the true sequence of\nevents is still unknown. So instead we see\nthe story from the perspective of a group\nof lawyers preparing a case for the\nappeal hearing. So we have a film that\nfunctions on two levels; the cerebral\ntension of the uncertainty over the\ninnocence of Klaus, which is inherently\nfascinating, and the more standard\nadrenaline rush of the race against time.\nThe performances are perfect. Jeremy\nIrons is superbly uptight as the repressed\nKlaus. Glenn Close turns in a performance\nas good as one would expect of her, as\nthe addictive (take your pick as to\nsubstance...) wife. (Can't wait to see her\nGertrude in the up-coming Hamlet). The\nV Rocky. This they then do, but not in the\nway you'd expect, and I'm not telling you\nwho wins. So there.\nThere are two ways of watching this\nfilm. The first was aptly demonstrated by\nthe critics, ie go into it with no intention\nof enjoying it. The second is to try to\nkeep an open mind and enjoy the film for\nwhat it is. I tried the second, and despite\nthe heavy-handed emotionalism, did find\nmyself willing Rocky to win in the last\nscenes, which I appreciate is rather sad,\nbut there you go.\nTo sum up, it is the best of the series\nsince the first (which deserved the three\noscars it won out of the ten that it was\nnominated for), probably due, at least in\npart, to having the same director as the\nfirst one. If you enjoyed the first one, are\na big 'Rocky' fan, or just fancy trying\nsomething that may turn out better than\nyou think, then go along.\nAlien Sex Fiend.\nsupporting cast are excellent, even if they\nare playing those particularly nauseating\nAmerican graduates\u2014lawyers.\nThis is all good. I enjoyed watching the\nfilm. So why does it worry me? Two\nreasons, mainly. Firstly, having a woman\n(who is still alive, even if she is,\neffectively, a vegetable) narrating the\nstory from a coma is a little sick.\nSecondly, one never feels emotionally\ninvolved, watching the film is a dispassionate affair. Yet I enjoyed doing\nso immensely. Hmmm. Pendragon.\nLSO\n27/1/91\nC The LSO can count amongst its\nranks many players who are fine\nsoloists in their own right. This\nconcert gave some of the principals of\nthe brass and woodwind sections the\nchance to take centre stage for the\nevening.\nMaurice Murphy and Rod Franks\nopened the concert with Vivaldi's Concerto in C for Two Trumpets.\nAlthough they were not ideally matched\nfor tone and musical quality, their playing\nwas tight and this was without a doubt\nthe outstanding performance of the\nevening.\nVaughan Williams' Tuba Concerto was\ntackled by Patrick Harrild. His playing\nstyle was more suited to the rapid\npassages rather than the slow, lyrical\nsections, and the performance was not\ntechnically perfect, but this was\nnevertheless an entertaining piece.\nIn contrast, the third piece was\nBernstein's Halil, for flute and orchestra.\nWritten in memory of an Israeli flautist\nkilled during national service, this piece is\nessentially a nocturne in which tonal and\nnon-tonal elements are in conflict. The\npiece is haunting, suggestive of both the\nfutility of war and hope in life. Paul\nEdmund-Davies gave ames me rising and\naccomplished performance as the solo\nflute, ably supported by the remainder of\nthe flute section.\nReturning refreshed and rested from the\ninterval, the audience was confronted\nwith an eight piece brass ensemble (four\ntrumpets, two trombones, horn and tuba)\nwho romped through Ingol-Dahl's Music\nfor Brass with, on the whole, tight, stylish\nand accurate playing.\nAndrew Marriner gave the gutsiest\nperformance of the evening, playing\nCopland's Clarinet Concerto. This was\ncomposed as a commission for Benny\nGoodman, and while it opens in\nunmistakable (and rather tedious) Copland\nstyle, it livens considerably with the\ncentral cadenza, in which the soloist has\nample opportunity to demonstrate his\nvirtuosity. The second half is then much\nbrisker, with a great sense of fun.\nMarriner's performance was blistering and\npowerful.\nThe evening ended with a performance\nof Ravel's La Valse. From the moment\nTilson Thomas strode on stage and\nostentatiously slapped shut his copy of\nthe score, indicating that he was going to\nconduct from memory, the audience\nknew they were probably in for\nsomething special. The piece perfectly\ncaptures the sense of the lost, doomed\nworld of Imperial Europe in the mid-nineteenth century, waltzing itself to\ndestruction. Tilson Thomas' energetic\nconducting nearly waltzed him off his\npodium, but this was a fine example of\nthe considerable talents of the LSO as an\nensemble.\nLiz W. Reversal Of Fortune\n6\n\n"

Their world seems to be\ninhabited only by pain and confusion\u2014the\nsong titles: Convulsion, Spasmolytic,\nShore Lined Poison point the way and the\nagony follows.\nTake Tormentor a sick song for a sick\nworld, it grinds down mercilessly,\neverything in a beat that reminds one of\nthe crash of jackboots. This is monotony\nelevated to an art form.\nSpasmolytic improves, complex rhythms\nand upfront bass providing an effective\nbackground for yet more tortured vocals.\nThis track is again improved by variation,\nwith the essential beat of the song never\nbeing lost.\nPuppy\nShore Lined Poison has an almost new\nage intro which is suddenly and horribly\nruptured by a rhythm that appears to be\ncomposed of the sounds of a broken\nradio. This is perhaps the best track on\nthe album, and excellent contrast being\ndrawn between industrial beat and almost\npeaceful keyboards. Intelligent samples\nfurther improve this music to play at a ridiculous volume and get lost in.\nWhilst Too Dark Park won't win them\nmany new fans, Skinny Puppy are shown\nto be at the forefront of a genre that\nsurely must replace the awfulness of\nManchester. And they'd be brilliant on\nTop of the Popsl\nThe Paleoethnobotanist.\nFront 242 \u2014Tyranny For You LP\nFront 242 approach the same ideas as\nSkinny Puppy from a different angle\naltogether. Significantly lighter-edged,\nTyranny for You is softly subversive,\nlulling you into a false sense of security\nwith tracks such as Sacrifice and Rhythm\nof Time the openers which show a heavy\nreliance on keyboard motifs and working\nextremely well.\nFront 242's vision comes through on\nTrigger 2, ominous keyboards\nunderpinning the rhythm in an interesting\nrole reversal.\nFor a long time, F242's entry into the\nmainstream' has been anticipated, and\nthis, if any, is surely the album to do it.\nFar too s carey still for Sharon and Kevin\nthough it is, this should find a ready\nhome next to, and far outshining in the\nmeantime bands such as The Shamen and\neven Depeche Mode, who now must be\nseen as trailblazers for this and its like.\n'Recession, Repression, Regression' is\nthe chant of the title track, and for once\nyou can be sure that its a band\ncommenting on their society and not on\ntheir own music. This album shows a new\nside to electro that F242 have been\nanticipating for some time. And I think its\nbloody good.\nThe Paleoethnobotanist.\nJan Johnson's vocals remind one instantly\nof those sharp melodic tones belonging to\nMichelle Shocked. The instrumental\ncomprises a sound, but light, jangle pop\nconfiguration. The rhythm going from an\neasy to follow beat to one of those\nannoying half times which tends to put\ndancers into slow motion for a second or\ntwo. That little re-adjustment to step time\nlooking so un cool. But who cares, 1 hate\nthe Empire in Leicester Square and I'm sure they wouldn't play it there anyway.\nA gaelic burr at times breaks to the\ncrest of a wave, just making itself\napparent like a small rush of foam on an\nexpectant wave. Uncontrolled but in-line\nand in harmony with the strength of Jan's voice. Funnily enough she hails from no\n-If This Is Love 12\"\nnearer the gaelic lands than Manchester.\nDon't worry though this is no fat, furry,\nbaggy Mancunian line up - the press\nrelease says so! It also says that J.J. are\nhere to 'create memorable hum mable songs'. This they do with no problem at\nall though some of those intro's are a little dod gy.I mean there along the lines\nof so many 'here we go lets make a classic they'll remember forever' songs\nand the backing surely hails from\nBeautiful South, House Martins...a touch\nof over production perhaps.\nStill, it's a slick little number that's bound to get far too many people\nhooked. Be careful, you might end up\nbuying all there records!\nChrist.\n15\n\n"

The 9-0 beating was\ndisappointing and 1 felt we could have\ngained a few points to make the score\nmore respectable.\nThe men's1st team had their problems\nfacing Southampton. With our best player\ninjured (Simon) the task became more\ndifficult. The match was evens right until\nthe last game at 4-4. We were not let\ndown by the U AU finalists last year\nSimon Hughes and Trevor Kernick who\nwon their game to give the 1st team a place in the quarter finals.\nThe 2nd team also needed this win\nagainst Nottingham for a quarter final\nplace. We came out victors in the same\nstage last year and this year the task\nseemed easier. IC beat Nottingham in the\nminimum number of games possible 5-0.\n17\nFencing\nCongratulations to Dave Hatton and Mark\nFrancis who have maintained their\nunbeaten run. Keep it up. The final score\n7-2 was a good perform a ne and will have\nto be maintained when both the 1st and\n2nd team play Loughborough next week.\nHaving come second in their round-robin group, IC ladies team did not\nautomatically qualify into the next round.\nIC ladies needed to beat UCL in the playoffs to advance into the next round. The\natmosphere was tense with both teams\nwanting this win desperately to prevent\nan early end to the U AU season.\nIC started well with the three pairs\noutplaying their counterparts with relative\nease. The match was over in the next\ntwo games when the IC ladies moved to\nan unbeatable 5-0 lead.

Eyes glazed and\nadrenal in flowing, he was solely intent on\nrepeating his earlier performances, but\nperhaps should have aimed at the other\ngoal, as his over hit back pass unexpectedly left the half-time score at\n1-1.\nAfter the in trod uci on of their sub John\nDunstan, IC began to assert their\nsuperiority. Jon Mottashed scored with an\nexcellent near-post header and then Gary\nMahoney displayed good finishing with\ntwo quick breakaway goals. Not deterred\nby certain midfielders suddenly\nbreakdancing in the mud due to cramp,\nthe 4th s finished off the game with\nanother header from Jon and the final\ngoal from Gary to complete an easy hat-trick.

    "content": "St\nFELIX\nA meditation on an thro p is m, religion, immortality, politics, tl\nWhat About The\nIam never sure whether the plural of\nbreak-through is break-through s or\nbreaks-through, but there have been\nseveral in the last few years, under the\nabove heading. The lads who specialise in\nthe big bang, the universe and everything\nhave proved that if the constants and\nlaws of physics differed from those we\nactually have by even the tiniest degree,\nno sentient life could have ever evolved\nanywhere in the cosmos. In other words\nthe universe would have been\nunobservable, since there would have\nbeen no one to observe it. There may of\ncourse be other, unobservable, universes\nbut who is to say?\nIs it possible to imply that this is all too\nmuch of a coincidence\u2014that it therefore\nmust 'all be for some purpose'\u2014without\nbeing thought to have made a religious\nstatement? Not necessarily of the 'bearded\ngrandfather figure dispensing miracles\nand dire retribution from a pink cloud'\nvariety (judging by what has happened to\ntelephone kiosks in our neighbourhood,\ndivine retribution seems to be a little thin\non the ground lately; we were in fact told\nas much on the highest ecclesiastical\nauthority when York cathedral was struck\nby lightning not so long ago for what\nseemed to me, as a total layman, very\nsensible reasons, considering the\npronouncements by the local rep).\nNonetheless, the probability against it all\ncoming together by random chance is\ntruly astronomical\u2014and that is a purely\nmathematical statement.\nNow it would appear that some\nreligious (well, perhaps not mainstream)\nthinkers have been affected by these\nbroad view tendencies for some time\nwithout being turned to pillars of salt.\nTeillhard de Chardin thought the\ndirection of Darwinian evolution to lie\nbroadly in a progression towards the\nattributes of divinity. So if you happen to\nbelieve that man's raison d'e tre on earth\nis to provide food for silverfish who live\non the little bits of skin that we shed\nfrom our bodies, that hypothesis would\nput paid to your creed. Unless, that is,\nyou have reason to believe both (a) that\nsilverfish are better able to survive a nuclear environmental holocaust than we\nare and (b) that they are capable of\nevolving into intelligent beings without\ndeveloping the tendency to exterminate\none another in the process. The trouble\nwith silverfish is that at the moment they\ndo not appear to rate very hi h gly as\npotential observers of the universe. I hope 1 am not doing them an injustice;\nlike Douglas Adams's white mice they\nmight possibly be the projections into our\ndimension of pan-galactic mega-intelligent\nbeings, but somehow 1 doubt it. If\nmankind were indeed just a rung on the\nladder, it might make more sense to\nsuppose that our function is to develop\nartificial intelligence as a potentially more\nbenign form of intellect which could\nobserve the universe without our\ntendencies to destroy the planet. We have\nrecently made a not unpromising start in\nthat direction (certainly the PC on which this is being typed seems rapidly to be\nevolving towards a mind of its own) but\nit's early days yet.\nUnfortunately we are programmed to\nbe altruistic on behalf of our genes rather\nthan intelligence in general. Our brains\nappear to have evolved to keep the wolf,\nnot to mention our predatory neighbours,\nfrom the front door and because of that\nwe do not seem to be at all that well\nequipped to understand what it is all\nabout. The only tool we have for groping\ntowards the light is severely bent. It is a bit like a caterpillar trying to work out\nthat the shortest distance from where it is\non the ground to the top of the nearest\ntree, from where a hungry bird is eyeing\nit, is not in fact to the bottom of the tree\nand then up the trunk. It matters if you\nare a caterpillar if only because, until you\nstart philo soph ising, the winged\nmessengers of death have such an easy\ntime performing caterpillar miracles by\nviolating caterpillar geometry. It should\nmatter to us for very similar reasons, as\nwe shall see.\nOur strongest programming, no doubt,\nis for self-preservation and death\navoidance. I cannot help but\nThe thought of dying does not cheer me\nup a lot\nMostly because this is the only me I 've\ngot.\nHowever, Iam a bit confused as to\nwhether the me I am so possessive about\nis the hardware or the software. The\nhardware is getting so repulsive it hardly\nseems worth fretting about. Besides, all\nthe bits it is made of have been and will\nagain be recycled, in due course. The\nsoftware, on the other hand, is so\nthoroughly networked by what I discuss,\nread, see on TV, research, etc, that I am\nnot convinced it is just mine; any more\nthan are the innumerable molecules I am\ntransient ly playing host to.\nI am generally amazingly prone to label\nthings 'mine'\u2014'my children, my land'\u2014\nperhaps by some perversion of the\nterritorial instinct. No doubt the early\ncaveman grunted 'keep away from my fire' and we still find nothing\npreposterous about his illusion of\npresuming to own an oxidation process\nconsuming stuff that grew! Could I be\nmaking the same mistake about 'my'\nconsciousness, 'my' intelligence? Perhaps\nit's not so much that I have consciousness\nas that some universal consciousness has\nme. After all, Iam definitely misguided in\nthe way I regard as being 'me' the\nmolecules I have just incorporated into\nmy body which were a part of yours a little while ago. We ought to try and\nunderstand how Mum Nature works this\ntrick, even if we are not going to groom\ncomputers or silverfish to take over,\nbecause the delusion evidently causes a lot of misery.\nIt seems to me that the thing which gives us the conviction of a single T, from cradle to grave is essentially just a memory circuit. In the way the stuff of\nwhich we are made continuously passes\nthrough us, while we retain a self-similar\nshape, we are rather like waves in a sea\nof matter. By way of a somewhat\ninadequate analogy which nevertheless\nhelps us to see ourselves from an\nexternal point of view, compare this with\na wave on a sea of water. If that had a memory, it would remember being born\nfar out at sea, it would experience the\npassage of time because of its fixed speed\nof progression and, eventually break, 'die'\nand lose its identity on reaching the\nshore. To become immortal and timeless,\nall that is required is the realisation\u2014\nquite obvious to any uninvolved\nobserver\u2014that the wave is the water, the\nuniverse and everything..!\nFish?\nparticles of which do not even travel\nalong with it whilst assuming its form.\nNow, if the wave did have a memory,\nthis realisation would be out of its reach.\nThis is because the memory must record\nexperiences of the wave form, not of the\nconstituent particles whose histories may\nall be different, if only because so many\nparticles are required to form a memory.\nHere the analogy wears thin because\nthere is no reason why a wave should\nhave a memory, whereas it is essential\nfor the working of the evolutionary\nscheme that we should. Without it, there\nwould be no self-awareness and the\nobvious way of ensuring that a mechanism will continue to be self maintaining \u2014indeed self-improving\u2014is to\nmake it strongly egocentric. This will\nmotivate it to avoid damage to itself, to\nfight to keep alive its present form and to\npro-create in a way which involves the\nchoice of the fittest (in the biological\nsense) partner available. The difficulty we\nhave in accepting these concepts are built\nin; our minds are constructed so as to\nsuppress experiences which cause us to\ndoubt our self-ness.\nThe ancient Eastern philosophies have\nsome astonishing insights into such\nmatters, all the more remarkable for\nbeing obtained by introspection and in\nthe mysterious Feignorance of current scientific knowledge.\nBuddhists might regard the above\nremarks about ownership as little more\nthan creative plagiarism from the\nBuddha's teachings on non-attachment.\nAgain, when the Yogi says not 'I am\ndying' but 'I observe my body to be\ndying' or, in non-terminal days, when he\nattempts to attain the nirvana of pure\nconsciousness in meditation by banishing\nhis thought and sensory inputs, he is\ncultivating the perception that 'he is the\nwater, not the wave' and hence his\nimmorality. This ecstatic state cannot be\nrational is ed in conventional evolutionary\nuseful values, unlike the euphoria induced\nby the a quis it ion of a new car, for\nexample. It appears to be more like the\nelation induced by a beautiful sunset\nwhich appears equally pointless in\nutilitarian terms.\nCould we live according to such\nbeliefs\u2014could we so transcend our\nevolutionary programming and would our\nsociety fall apart if we did? All the\nevidence suggests that any kind of\nidealism and altruism doesn't stand a chance against our egocentric\nprogramming\u2014look how quickly 'from\neach according to his ability, to each\naccording to his needs' became 'from\neach according to his coe rc i bil it y, to each\naccording to his Party rank'! However,\nwe do now have the beginning of a movement which cares for the\nenvironment in the longer term and, after\nall, what could be more selfish than\nseeking personal enlightenment? If\nopinion polls are to be believed, Vsrds of\nthe population in any case have an innate\nconviction regarding some sort of survival\nafter death and the pursuit of immortality\nis a wonderfully egocentric activity. For\nthat matter, remnants of inner\ncontentment evidently can be turned to\npractical use\u2014like the willingness to work\nexcessive hours\u2014judging by the way the\nindustrialised Buddhist societies of the Far\nEast appear to be taking over.\nPerhaps what it is all about is so big\nand simple that we cannot grasp it (any\nmore than the caterpillar can\ncomprehend bird geometry). Something\nlike the sea of consciousness, intelligence,\nneeding eyes, ears, sensors to experience\nthe material universe, to observe it\nexisting and functioning. Some of us may\nhave to put this into faith speak by saying\nthat the function of man is to praise the\nLord. The risk is that, if it isn't people,\nperhaps it could be machine intelligence,\nsilverfish or little green men from another\ngalaxy. At least we should put in our bid.\nFe-Wei.\nWorld Leaders\nin Student Travel\n\u2022 Low Cost Flights on Quality\nAirlines\n\u2022 Special Fares for Students\n\u00a9 Weekend Breaks, Tours &\nGroup Bookings\n\u2022 Well Travelled Staff to\nGuide You\n\u2022 Over 100 Offices\nWorldwide\nULU Travel\nImperial College\nSherfield Building\nLondon SW7\nIrl ULU TRAVEL\nCity and Quilds\nMlL'Ki c T<K% Dr\n<Dc\nLLlVc\nE( Ry\nThursday 14th Jtb\nConfidentiality Assured\n'Bookings taken before\nMonday 11th feb\nIn Quilds Office Cost: from \u00a35. oo\n\n"

The exercises, which are taken from\nvarious styles and martial arts flexibility\ntraining, concentrate on stretching,\nalthough there are also some med at it ive aspects. They improve physical\nsuppleness, breathing and mental\nconcentration, and are a good\ncomplement to other physical activities.\nA sizable contingent of our lovable insane\nathletes trooped off en masse to\nHorsenden Hill for part 4 of the colleges'\nleague saga, delivering another\nphenom e nous display of mud-wallowing\nsufficient to extend our overall lead to\nunassailable proportions. On a fairly tame\ncourse of 5.3 miles, the unbeaten Paul\nNorthrop achieved a surprisingly easy\nvictory despite his dod gy knee, drifting in\nfront after two miles and cruising away\nunchallenged. Storming home in fourth\nwas Frank Dudbridge, still improving\nafter all these years, having worked his\nway up from 15th after the opening\ncharge. His erstwhile companion, Alex Gaskell, suffered towards the end; six\nweeks missed through injury taking its\ntoll. In a photo-finish with the enigmatic\nBill Skailes, once more producing a de spear te final sprint, Alex was awarded\n16th with Bill only able to equal his best\nplacing of 17th. But both were upstaged\nby Laurence Fowkes, the sturdy squad die, who, after mixing it with the leaders\nearly on, settled into the chasing group\nand improved massively to finish 12th. Again our opponents could not match this\npacking and IC took the team honours by\n41 points. Meanwhile the 'B' runners\nenjoyed an average day, Duncan O 'Dell's radical attitude winning the day in 53rd to Dan McQueen's59 th. Dave Budgett\nhad one of his less successful ventures in\n69th. Our two lady representatives acquitted\nthemselves well, with Edwige Pitel\nmanaging 3rd after a tight finish with a group chasing the runaway winner. Helen\nMacintosh also needed to produce\nterminal strength to break into the top 10\nfor the first time this year. The results\npushed Edwige into second place in the\noverall women's rank, and with two races\nremaining, our team looks like reaping a record glut of medals at the end of the\nseason.\nDiving Rugby\nAt the swimming pool, some time has\nbeen set aside (Wed 6.30pm) for those\nwho enjoy, or would like to learn, board\ndiving. We hope to start a diving club\nwhich will be open to all levels of ability.\nWomen's Waterpolo\nWe are looking for more women to make\nup a women's water polo team. There are\ncurrently three of us, all newcomers to\nthis brilliant game.\nAt the moment we practice with the\nmen on Monday and Friday evenings\nbetween 7.30 and 9.00pm. Although once\nwe have enough people we can arrange\nour own pool session and coaching.\nWaterpolo is an excellent team sport,\nimproving fitness, stamina and\ncoordination. It is also an ideal way to\nimprove your swimming as we have a swimming practice on the same evening.\nDon't worry if you can't make all of the\nsessions any regular participation would\nbe welcome.\nIf interested just turn up or call Bron on\next 6851 or Caroline on 4772.\nIC 1st XV - 7 Cardiff 1st XV - 10\nAfter qualifying from the South East\ngroup IC Rugby faced Cardiff in the last\nsixteen of the U AU. The Welshies getting\nto this stage by defeating Birmingham\n60-3 in a play-off round.\nLast year IC went out of the\ncompetition defeated 31-12 by Swansea,\nwho went on and narrowly lost to\nLoughborough in the final at \u2022\nTwickenham. It was a brave display from\nthe much younger and inexperienced IC\nside. With virtually the same team,\nconfidence was running at a much higher\nlevel this year. The IC outfit was better\nprepared and keener than ever before.\nWith a hardy band of supporters\ncheering on the lads, IC kicked off on a cold Wednesday afternoon. The opening\nminutes were quite frantic, both packs\nhunting ferociously for the ball and when\nit was spun to the backs each side tackled\nclinically. The game was cut and thrust,\nnothing given either way. Eventually\nafter an IC infringement, the Cardiff\nstandoff landed a penalty, breaking the\ndeadlock and putting Cardiff three points\nup. IC got right back into the game and\nsoon scores were tied, thanks to a Mike\nAnderson penalty 'success'. Just before\nhalf-time Cardiff fly hacked the ball\ndown field, after some sloppy clearance\nefforts, the ball bobbled into the flanker's hands who due ly popped over to score a pretty dire try. (Half-time: IC 3, Cardiff 7).\nThe second continued much in the way\nof the first. IC trying to pick the pace up\na gear and Cardiff keeping the play tight,\nusing their heavier forwards to grind IC\ndown, moving down field one scrum or\nline out to the next. The Cardiff pressure\nnever seemed to be converted into\npoints. Thanks to stout IC defence and a miserable day from the Cardiff kicker (he\ndid manage one in the second half) the\nscores were kept to a minimum. Then, as\nif releasing a pressure cap, IC broke out,\nwith blinding brilliance, all out defence\nwas turned into all out attack, forwards\nswarming up field like ravishing herds,\nbacks striding upfield as if steroid\nimplanted. Cardiff were on the rack, after\na darting run, Mike Anderson went over\nfor a try. Horrah!\nThe conversion went wide and this was\nto be the last significant event of the\ngame. After efforts in the dying moments\nIC went down by only 3 points. IC 7,\nCardiff 10.\n16\n\n"

    "content": "Who? Pt.2\nDear Andy,\nThe men at IC think they've got it hard\nbut it all looks pretty limp to me. You see\nAndy, when you've had a hard day at\ncollege and you fancy a couple of bev vies with the girls, you discover you've got no\nmoney on you so you have to pick up\nsome poor ugly bastard (not a problem at\nIC) to buy you enough drinks to put up\nwith the shag he expects in return.\nSo there he is, pissed as a newt (but not\nhalf as good looking) and desperate to get\nhis end away so he can brag to his mates\nthe next day and prove that he's not a closet homo after all (which is nothing\ncompared to the laugh us girls will have\nwhen I tell them how crap he was in\nbed). He's too fucking stupid to know\nhow to put a condom, so, to get it over\nand done with a.s.a.p. you give him a hand. If he can get it up and doesn't Wind Up\nDear Sir,\nPendragon failed to answer my question\nin her reply last week.\nWhy sub sid is e the arts and no other\nleisure activity?\nAnother quite interesting point it raised\nis from the quote '...the only reason that\nbig companies need sub sidi sing is that too\nmany people are unwilling to try\nsomething different.'\nQuite clearly this means that people\ndon't want to go and watch this stuff.\ncont.\nall who believe'! And it's a free gift!\nThe beauty of it is that once we accept\nthis free gift, God gives us a bit of\nHimself for good (as a kind of guarantee\nof what is to come) and the Holy Spirit,\nwho regenerates our being and hence we\nare 'born-again' in the Spirit.\nWhat's more, the Holy Spirit is a 'counsellor' that teaches us, encourages us\nand empowers us as we begin to become\nmore and more like the people God\nintended us to be and then we do good\nworks anyway because of our life for God\nand our lives start to make sense, with\nnew hope and joy.\nI say to you Athena that once that's sorted out, then you should wonder about\nwhat heaven and hell are like.\nProverbs 19v3 says: 'A man's own folly\nruins his life yet his heart rages against\nthe Lord.'\u2014think about it!\nWith my love and prayers,\nDavid Fernandez-Arias.\ncome before he's shoved it in you've got\nto put up with 10 seconds of pumping\nand grinding, huffing and puffing, before\nhe pulls out and asks you if you've come\nand falls asleep before you even lie.\nThen you look down at his limp prick\nwhich looks like a slime y dwarf in a giant\ndustbin liner and the fucking condom's burst (not surprising where he was\nshoving it - do zy bastard!). Three months\nlater you find yourself up the twig. You don't want to have the bastard's bastard\nbut you get some loony from the God\nsquad (male) telling you not to get it\nsucked and he won't take ' F**k OFF!' for\nan answer.\nYes, I agree with you Mr 'Real Man',\nBritish standards really are dropping.\nA real woman.\nMmmmm....\nASF\nWhy not put plays and musicals on that\npeople want to watch, which are popular?\nLloyd-Webber doesn't get a subsidy yet\nhe has no problem in filling theatres. It is\nsimple supply and demand economics. I have nothing against the arts, all I say is\nif they are so good then they wouldn't need a subsidy, would they?\nApart from the arts, public schoolboys\nand Iraqis, the other thing that pisses me\noff are Vegetarians and Antivivisectionists.\nFirstly the veggies. These bunch of\nweirdos are supposed to be healthier than\nus meat eaters. Yet have you ever seen a more miserable ill looking shower? These\npeople are so stupid that when they eat\nvegetables they are probably committing\ncannibalism. Well I couldn't survive\nwithout a meat pie or hamburger at least\nonce a day.\nAs for the anti vivisectionists this lot\ndon't give a toss about people. All they\ncare about is animals.\nWell I won't use any shampoo unless I have a guarantee that it has been\nthro roughly dripped into the eyes of\nsome bunny wu n ny. By the way\nPendragon used the word bigoted (again)\nto attack me. This just goes to prove that\nmy critics are to originality what Ethiopia\nis to catering.\nYours,\nAlan Bailey.\nAlan, how would you feel about\nparticipating in a public debate centering\non the issues you have raised in the\nabove and previous letters?

Thorough in-house\ntraining is given in a wide range of business skills and the opportunity exists to be sponsored to study for\nan MBA at a top business school after two years with the Firm.\nLimited vacancies exist for outstanding graduates to join FCS in October 1991.\nFurther information will be available at a presentation on:-Wednesday 6 February 1991\nat 6.00 p.m. at 1 Surrey Street, London\nor from Gillian Jones, Arthur Andersen and Co., 1 Surrey Street, London WC2\nInterviews will be conducted on Thursday 7 February 1991.\nBrochures and application forms are available from your Careers Service.\nArthur Andersen ARTHUR ANDERSEN& CO., S.C. Fia ti ii c in I Co ii s it Iii ng\nScrviccs\nJean-Francoise Lucas (Physics 1987-90) explains how he chose his career and how his\nwork has developed in his first year of life after IC.\nWhere John Cleese Went Wrong\nProbably for many of you the time has\ncome to make the biggest decision of\nyour life. The question is what career do\nyou want to throw yourself into now that\nyou have finished your degree?\nI was in that same position about 12\nmonths ago, undecided as to whether to\ngo into Marketing or into the popular and\ndemanding area of Accountancy. In the\nend, I chose Accountancy and the chance\nto acquire one of the premier business\nqualifications, the internationally\nrecognised Chartered Accountancy\nqualification.\nOf course, having made that decision, I was faced with another\u2014which firm did I want to join? The various recruitment\nbrochures and articles were an important\nsource of information to help with this,\nbut by far the most persuading evidence\nwas what I learned by meeting and\ntalking to people already working with\nthe various firms, and it was on that basis\nthat I chose Arthur Andersen.\ninternationally, Arthur Andersen is one\nof the largest firms of accountants, tax\nand law consultants in the world. It is a young firm, staffed by young people, and\nit prides itself on working hard to achieve\nits objectives in every area of its business.\nYou should remember that there are\nmany different special is at ions wi ht in accountancy at Arthur Andersen. An important tip before making your decision\nis to analyse carefully the pro's and con's of each one. I chose the Tax Consultancy\ndivision.\nActually, the name 'Tax Consultancy'\nprobably doesn't do justice to the range\nof areas covered. As an example, my\ngroup has just finished advising on the\nleveraged buy-out of an international\nconsumer product group. As well as\nadvising on how to structure the deal so\nthat the most favourable tax position was\nachieved in the 19 different countries\nwhere the group operates, we were\ninvolved in deciding which currencies the\nsenior and mezzanine finance should be\nborrowed in, how to remit blocked funds\nto Europe from Latin American and Asian\ncountries, negotiating the terms of the\nsale and purchase contracts with the\nseller, and a whole range of other legal\nquestions, Monopolies Commission issues\nand general business decisions. There is\nno doubt that being part of the Arther\nAndersen team on a deal like that is a very quick way to learn how\ninternational business operates.\nIt did not surprise me much to learn\nthat the job involves a lot of hard work\nand commitment, but in return I have\nbeen involved in a range of stimulating\nassignments and have had the\nopportunity to travel abroad and work\nwith colleagues from all around the\nworld. A lot of early responsibility has\nbeen given to me matched by in-house\ntraining on how to handle that\nresponsibility.\nThere is also a well defined career\nstructure, so that I know where I can\nexpect to be in the years ahead provided\nthat I keep up my efforts\u2014indeed, there\nare quite a few Imperial graduates who mI work with here who have been\npromoted to manager and have increased\ntheir starting salaries fivefold within 4 or\n5 years of leaving Imperial.\nHopefully this will give you a clearer\npicture of what accountancy can offer\nyou and what Arthur Andersen is all\nabout. Don't get me wrong it's not all\nabout just work. In the office everybody\nhas a very professional attitude but when\nthe social life starts...well...I 'll leave that\nup to you to find out!!\n21\n\n"

This is not the case: there is a safety net whereby any student facing\nfinancial difficulty can be considered for\npayment. Yve Posner, the Union Welfare\nOfficer, has said that all students with any\nfinancial problems should apply.\nThe nominal closing date for\napplications is 8 February, and application\nforms are available from room344 in the\nSherfield building.\nEccentric?\n'In Pursuit of Eccentrics' - Dr David\nWeeks from the Royal Edinburgh Hospital\nwill be giving two lectures on his search\nfor 'persons who deviate from normal\nforms of behaviour, especially in a bizarre\nmanner'. He has uncovered over 4000 so\nfar, who find eccentricity a good strategy\nfor survival.\nDr Weeks will be showing videos of\nsome of the most eccentric eccentrics.\nThese include the woman that kept a red\nplastic lobster with her, lovingly stroking\nit when seated, and the man who likes to\ndress up as a pink elephant and a bse il down buildings. He claims to have cured\nmore alcoholics than any doctor.\nBoth lectures will be on Wednesday 6\nFebruary in Lecture Theatre 1, Physics\ndepartment. The first lecture will start at\n1.15pm, all are welcome. The second\nlecture will be a public lecture, to\ncommence at 5.30pm. Because of safety\nrequirements, numbers will be restricted.\nImperial College Committee\nto Stop War in the Gulf\na The Chairman of the Anti-War Committee, Philip Gribben\nOn31 January the Imperial College\nCommittee to Stop War in the Gulf met\nfor the first time. From a turn-out of\nabout forty, eight people volunteered for\nthe committee. The committee's immediate concern was to drum up\nsupport for this Saturday's march through\ncentral London.\nOne of the current objectives of the\nBritish anti-war movement is to raise it's profile nationally as international peace\nprotests gather momentum.\nDemonstrations in Washington, Bonn and\nBerlin have attracted mass public support\nwhile last week's London march had a comparatively low turn-out.\nImperial's committee for peace does not\nwant any party political ties. It intends to\njoin the national 'Committee to Stop War in the Gulf and hopes to be the shortest\nlived Imperial College society ever.\nGulf War Soc\nThis week, a pro-Gulf War society was\nformed at Imperial. A spokesman said\nthat their aim was 'to promote the\nancient but sadly neglected art of\nwarfare'. 'Saddam must be thrown out,\nnot only from Kuwait, but also from Iraq.\nThis will promote regional instabilities,\nresulting in further warfare in the region.'\nIt is rumoured that the new society is\nbeing sponsored by a German chemical\nwarfare industry.\nThe chairman of Dassault, the French\naerospace group, has been invited to\nspeak at the next meeting of the society\non January 15.\nA minor incident occured when\nsupporters of the pro-war society clashed\nwith the anti-war society. Apparently 12\nof the pro-war supporters were killed,\nwhile casualties among the anti-war\nsupporters ran into hundreds.\nBicycle Security\nYes, we say the same thing every week;\nbuy aD lock, chains are not secure, but\nbikes are still being stolen each week.\nThis time there's a new angle: your bike\nis not safe even if you take it to your\noffice...\nThis week, bicycles have been stolen\nfrom the basement of the Royal School of\nMines and from the eighth floor of the\nElectrical Engineering Department. This is\nnot, however, the first time bicycles have\nbeen stolen from departments; in the last\nfew years the top floors of Physics and\nChem Eng have also been hit.\nCollege Security ask students to be\nwary as bicycle thieves are continuously\nactive around the college. A rear wheel\nhas been stolen from below Sherfield, and\ntwo suspects chased off from the rear of\nthe Science Museum Library. Security\nwould also like students to be vigilant for\nsuspicious packages or unattended bags -please keep your own property with you.\nIt makes sense to secure your bike to\nsomething immovable with aD lock.\nThese cost \u00a320.50 and are available from\nCollege security on level 1 Sherfield,\nextension 3370.\n3\n\n"

    "content": "St\nFELIX\nDriven Mad Torn between a Porsche and pollution, Christopher Riley\nexamines the environmental impact of the motor car and some\nsolutions to the congestion and accompanying pollution that\nbedevils Britain's roads in the 1990s. st\nFELIX\nEver had that guilty feeling about cars?\nYou are torn between a passionate love\naffair for buying, cleaning, owning and\nrunning a car and that little bit of guilt\nabout the destructive consequences; the\npollution, which is slowly killing the\nplanet and people.\nAs cars become easier to drive, the\nconcentration required to drive them\ndecreases. Modern cars are stuffed with\nhome comforts: CD players and radios\nwith stereo, dolby NR quadraphonic all\nround-sound telephones and even faxes! It\nis easy to forget you are not at home as\nyou speed at over 120kph down that\nsmooth, straight road, 'brain dead' and\nnumbed with boredom. With the\ncompulsory wearing of seat belts\nbecoming law, the number of minor\ncollisions increased. People instantly felt\nsafer and concentration lapsed even\nmore. During a journey a driver is\ntypically thinking about driving for only\n7 5 % of the time. This means that every\nfourth driver coming towards you on the\nroad is not concentrating.\nThe human brain was not designed for\ncontrolling a rapidly moving object. When walking, the average person looks less\nthan a metre ahead. Joggers look a little\nfurther, and at thirty miles an hour we still only focus at a point about a cricket\npitch length in front of the car.\nConsequently, with stopping distances at\nmotorway speeds many times this\ndistance, accidents are only too common.\nThirty people are killed every two days\non British roads, yet if there are thirty\nfatalities from a train crash, it is declared\na national disaster. In fact the single\ndeath which resulted from the Cannon\nMend-a Bike\nPETER THOMAS46 Effie Road\nFulham, London SW6 IT D0713715867 Street rail crash at the beginning of this\nyear warranted it 'national disaster',\nrequiring inquiries, public outcry and\npress hype.\nOut of all the cars sold each year in Britian, 6 0 % are secondhand. Despite this,\na staggering 35 million new cars are\nproduced each year worldwide. That's one car each second. Go to sleep at night\nand 30,000 new cars have been created\nbefore you wake in the morning. Sneeze\nand five cars are born into the world.\nThankfully for us, at the moment, the\nthird world's reliance on the internal\ncombustion engine is not as great as ours.\nThere are currently 500 million cars in the world. If China had cars to' the same\nratio as the USA then they alone would\nhave 500 million cars. In eastern Europe\nthey are experiencing their first freedom\nfor many years and car manufacturers\nare 'meeting the challenge'.\nIf the car density of north Europe is to\nspread to the rest of the world it will\nhave serious environmental\nconsequences. Even unleaded petrol still\ncontains hundreds of potentially harmful\ntoxins. The world cannot support this\n; level of growth in air pollution. The I predicament cannot be stressed more\nclearly than this, but as with all these\nenvironmental problems, the\nconsequences are not immediate.\nDestruction and poisons accumulate, out\nof sight, until it is too late. The hole in the ozone layer is invisible and the\ngreenhouse effect just means warmer\nsummers to a lot of people.\nSo what is the answer? This incurable\nlove affair that man has with his car is\nmore than just an extension to his\ngenitals, a statement of his sexual\nprowess. The freedom of transport has\nbeen a 'human right' since man climbed\non the back of a beast and rode it. The car, simply an evolution of this beast, is a political hot potato. Any government who\nbars this freedom of driving will be in\npolitical isolation for a long while. The right to travel where we want, when we want is taken for granted, yet in congested Britain the 'freedom of the\nopen road' is a joke. Millions would\nrather crawl in queues all day like sheep,\nthan use public transport. Why?\nUsing public transport is estimated to\nbe the equivalent of 130-200 mpg per\npassenger, so it is preferable if it can\nprovide a reliable service, which is cheap,\nclean and secure, particularly for women\nat night.\nThe old excuse that 'public transport\nisn't efficient' is outdated. It seems\ndoubtful that the improvements in public\ntransport called for by organisations such\nas ETA( a mass membership transport\nusers organisation) would solve the\nproblems. Psychologists explain that\npeople can't relax on public transport.\nYou can't pick your nose, break wind or\nhave sex on a bus or in a train! You haven't got complete freedom of\nmovement and behaviour that the\nisolated capsule of a car gives you.\nIn whatever guise, the car is here to\nstay. Its use is threatening to rise\n83-142% in the next 35 years. Despite\nthis, governments, vehicle manufacturers\nand drivers all have a role to play in reducing the impact of the car on the\nenvironment. The first electric car was\nreleased in1986. It instantly acquired the\nstatus of a rusty Robin Reliant and was\nshunned by the public. Electric vehicles\nstill have the prestige of a milk float or a sewing machine, associated with menial\nwork. No finely tuned growl from\nbeneath the bonnet, no chromed exhaust\npipe, no need for fuel injection, and no\nplace for Turbo lag! But are Britain's motorists so blinkered? Electric motors\nrequire less maintenance mile for mile.\nNo frozen die z elin the winter, no antifreeze required, and no burst radiators.\nTo improve the appeal of the electric\nvehicle you have to analyse what it is\nthat sells a car. Although cars are bought\nprimarily for getting from A to B, the\nlooks, performance and, of course, the\nname are all important. A logo on the\nignition key sitting on the bar in the pub\nspeaks volumes! The 'GTi' badge or the\nword 'Turbo' tattooed on the boot are a must. The image and profile of a car will\nmake or break it.\nEach car has its label, which the person\nbehind the wheel automatically inherits.\nBe it a well y green Range Rover, a Ferrari-red Porsche or a white 2 CV we all\nhave a picture of the sort of person who\nwould drive it. This label is to a certain\nextent controlled by the manufacturer.\nPeugeot's advert for its 405 range\nfeaturing the car driving through a burning field to the song 'Take my Breath\nAway' did more for sales of that car than\nany other car advert in marketing\nhistory. The new Lotus Carlton is\nadvertised by being capable of a top\nspeed of 176mph. But where and why?\nPaul Tosch, Vauxhall's chairman admits\nthat it is an ego trip. 'We wanted to show\nthat we could do it. It's an image car'.\nSimon Dyer, Director General of the A A criticises this as environmentally\nirresponsible. Manufacturers should no\nlonger use speed and high performance\nto advertise and sell cars. 'It is time to be\nproud of cars because they are safe and\nhave a minimum impact on the\nen iv ron ment.' Battery technology is no longer the\nlimiting factor of a potential electric car.\nWhat is needed is a well established\nmanufacturer to set the trend in electric\nvehicles. Something instantly desirable to\nnurture man's incurable love affair with\nthe motor car, not turn him off; the\n'Lotus Electron' or the 'Ford Sierra XR4e'.\nSuch machines must be sold at realistic\nand competitive prices.\nUnlike other 'green consumerism' the\npublic don't have the power to initial is e the change to the electric vehicle. Once a realistic vehicle is available, government\naction is needed to initiate the transfer to\nthe el ct ric motor-car. Only higher fuel\nprices will be the spur, to ensure that\npolluters pay.\nOf course this con vers on to electric\nvehicles is not going to solve congestion\nproblems on the roads. New road building\njust generates more traffic jams and is not\nan answer to the problem either. As long\nas Britain's blinkered motorists want the\nfreedom to pick their noses in whichever\ntraffic jam they please, our roads will\nalways be clogged.\nThe first challenge is to cut the exhaust\nemissions from the millions of stationary\ncars. Until electric vehicles are freely\navailable, choosing a car which delivers\nmore miles per gallon and making sure it\nis properly tuned will both help to lower\nfuel cons ump tio+ i. Alternatively a little\nknown device called the 'Petromizer'\ncould help. Currently marketed by\nMarvelawn International at just under S50\nit guarantees 10-16% lower fuel\nconsumption, more power and reduced\ntoxic emissions. Consequently companies\nlike Shell are keen to keep it a secret.\nThe Petromizer consists of a powerful bar\nmagnet which simply attaches to the\noutside of the fuel line. Quite why it\nworks is not known, but the magnet\napparently reduces the surface tension of\nthe fuel, producing better atom is ation and\nincreasing combustion efficiency. For\nmore information on the Petromizer\nplease write to Dr John Speight,\nTechnical Director, Marvelawn\nInternational, Dicken House, Harrold,\nBedford MK437 BX.
