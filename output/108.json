S.Un jon meeting yesterday, the following were elected: President: Derek Butters. VicePresident: Tony Hod ga cu. Union Council Rep: John Nation. Entertainments Committee: Mess rs Green, Amos, Warwick er,Bo god, Harvey, Moore. The meeting. was very poorly attended probably due to the impending exams Reports were given from the Clubs Committee, the Entertainments Committee, and from the President, Tony Gooding s. He said that, while on the whole, it had been a goodyear, the apathy among a large part of R.C.S. Union members was appa ling. The burden of work fell on too few people. He quoted as an example the building of Jezebel' s garage, when, from the whole college, only about ten( l0) people came along to help I The proceedings were accompanied by cascades of water between various groups, who used their wash bottles with deadly effect. At one point, a trapdoor opened in the ceiling, and there slowly descended a piece of cardboard inscribed\" M.I.5\" with an eye below. The meeting ended with a\"Kan gala\". At the Guilds Union meeting the following were elected: President: Dave Stevens. Secretary: Marian Bian ek. Vice gres i& ent: John Sheldon. Hon. Jun. Tre as; Nick Clark. Union Council Rep George Gilson. Before the Guilds Union Meeting opened, all members stood in silence in memory of Archie Reinhardt s, who died in hospital after a car crash a few days ago The President, John Hart, in his report, said that Guilds was not fully represented in the Lord Mayors Show because of official errors. However after the show, Bo and her followers proceeded to\" wash the backside of King's\". He was sorry to say that sporting results were not as successful as the you g it to be; there was he felt a distinct lack of inter st shown by the student body, this was especially noticeable on sports daywhen only a handful of Guilds men turned up to support the victorious team. It was decided after P.L. Levine' s suggestion that Bo should should goon from Pic cad i ly Circus, after the mascots Jubilee Rally, to the Mansion House and present an address of thanks to the City Fathers for their benefactions to Guild's. After discussion It was agreed that Mess rs. Hart and Duckworth should take their girlfriends with them and- that John Ha \u00b1 t should wear his frock coat as\" this vi rou ld look better\", he said,\" than Mines In their boiler suits covered in grease and dirt\". ARCHITECTURAL HORRORS. Further plans of the College expansion were on show in. the Rod eric Hill Building on Wednesday, Included in this was an artists impression of yet another scheme for the central site. This is quite the worst that has appeared. The Coll cut tower still remains, but now mounted on a raised plinth with steps leading up tp it. The assembly hall has been moved nearby and is of a most unusual shape. Along four story block crosses from east to west. The result is that two courtyards are formed, surrounded by tall buildings, with the corresponding lack of light, a factor that was to be avoided at all costs according to the Rector in his talk on the plans about a year ago. There is a covered way crossing the site diagonally and. three tennis courts are indicated. The four tall blocks apear to be about nine stories high. Little parking space for motor vehicles seems to have been provided. Also on view were details of the proposed new hostels in Princes Gardens. These appear to be composed of glass fronted mato h boxes piled on top of each other. It was\nclaimed that. there would be places for1032 students and about1200 rooms in all. Several3 and5 roomed flats being provided forT. wardens and staff.A swimming pool was also planned. FOOTNOTE.

Seeing a cars top for a pedestrian, he i we ii.;..!/ pounced. Notebook and pencil were produced, and.. earnest conversation followed. With thumbs in tunic the officer sauntered under the archway, and asked. the nearest student where the Principal resided. On being rebuffed, he proceeded to the Union Office door but found it locked. He was' directed across the road. Proceeding across the zebra he entered the porter's lodge and made use of the p none. Reinforcements arrived quickly in the form of several other constable.:, and a Black Maria. Some of the officers reacted to the zebra in the spirit in which it was painted, and one suggested that some of the stationary cars should be booked for parking inside the restricted, area of the crossing.,. Others were not as genial. One innocent I.C. man attempting to cross the. road hesitated to allow a taxi to pass. The taxi stopped and the driver waved him on. He responded to the signal, and a man in blue darted' after him, caught him roughly by the shoulder and proceeded to take do vm particulars..( Boos from the' crowd11) \u2022 One officer was., heard to exclaim loudly, pointing at the inoffensive object\" That' s not legal\".

He pointed out to the policeman that there was \"No Parking Between the White Lines'. \"Oh, that' s just something you boys have put up\", said the lawman. In reply, Pete reached through the Union Office window and, picking up the phone,- dialled the number of the Domestic Bursar. This eminent gentle manY/ as informed of the proceedings, and as a result arrived at the o scene. He remonstrated with the offending' officer, who meekly acquiesced. The car was\nmoved i \u2022 .\nEarlier in the day, however, the police had pointed out that these notices had\" no legal significance\". The police had completely drifted away by5 o' clock. The latest dev elopement was yesterday when an official, of Westminster City Council arrived,, carefully measured the dimensions of the crossing, and tested the paint with his finger. He looked up and grinned when bar racked by Aero students, 'and remarked that they had better have a whip round. FOOTNOTE Thursday evening: Zebra still present. CLASHES WITH POLICE.2 Field Cup Race. 'Twenty policemen, complete with their waterproof underclothing, arrived at Guilds' entrance,, provide entertainment after the finish of the Annual Field Cup Race, won t this year by the Chemical Engineering Department, The race, organised this year by Chad, entailed the removal of a i+5 gallon drum from the bushes on the other side of the Serpentine, its transportation across the water, but not by the bridge, and its eventual deposition in fc l Sl entrance Hall of Guilds.

This was the high-light of the celebration of the Granting of\noriginal Royal Charter in June 1907. After\narriving at the North Entrance to the Union\nat 3 p.m., she made her way into the Concert\nHall in wh i oh were assembled representatives\nof the Governing Body, Local Government\nOfficials, Staff, and about 70 members of\ntha student body of I.C.A solemn procession\nof dignitaries down the Hall, to the strains\nof soft mu sio played by the Royal Artillery SILWOOD SUCCESSES.\nThe floral decoration of the Union and the\nRoderic Hill Building was carried out by the\nchief Gardener of Silwood. The preparation of\nplants for this occasion began last October.\nThe work was accomplished in fine style and with\ngreat success and we extend to him and his band\nof stalwart helpers a very great thank you.\n\u00ab*.w f< iH \u2022 I\"v \u2022 \\ an s a Orchestra, was led by the Student Bedell, P.L. Lovine, followed by the Student Presidents,\nDean* of the Oollege and other high off io iala. Finally came the Rector, Lord Falmouth and\nthe Queen Mother aa Chancellor of the university. Lord Falmouth, in his speech of welcome,\nspoke of the aloes links between the College\nand the Royal Family throughout the whole\nhistory of the College, beginning with Prlnoe\nAlbert, President of the Board of Governors\nof the Royal College of Chemistry. The Consort was instrumental In devoting the site of the Exhibition of 1851 to the furtherance\nof Art, Science and Architecture. The Royal\nPatronage continued with the granting of the\nRoyal Charter in1907 by King Edward VH. Since then the reigning Sovereign had always\nshown deep interest in the affairs of the\nCollege. It was, Lord Falmouth said, a great privilege and honour that Her Majesty\nthe Queen Mother had graciously consented to\ndeclare open the Roderio Hill Building, and\nto unveil an inscription to Sir Roderio.\nIn her reply, Her Majesty spoke of her\nown contacts with tha College over a period\n\u00b0f many years, and the great pleasure she\nhad In participating in these Jubilee celebrations. She reiterated the closeness of\nthe links of the College with the Royal Fami ly, and emphasised the present day need for Centres of Learning devoted to the Teohnologioal Soienoea. Finally she declared the\nnew building open.\nIn his reply, the Rector, in a somewhat\nlighter vein, mentioned that the two Sciences\nof Chemical Engineering and Aeronautics were\nin the forefront of modern develop a ent a. Without them the Country would find it difficult to hold it ao an in the World in tha\nrears to acts*.\nThe platform party then left the Concert\nHeJJ and moved downstairs into the Beit\nGarden and walked across the Garden and\nFrinee Consort Road between lines of Marshals.\nDECORATIVE PLAQUE IN RODERIC HILt BUILDING.\nThe fine tiled panel in the entrance hall to\nthe building is the design of Prof. Baker of the\nRoyal College of Art, and was m \u00bb ju fact u red by\nCopeland's Spode Works in fine Bone China. The\nwork presented much technical difficulty as it was the first tia e that a work of this type had\nbeen attempted.

    "content": "FELIX The University of London Lodgings Bureau\nare now opening their next te rrr fs application\nlist in June. Each year, they say, the posit i or becomes worse and worse. In our experience,\nthe Lodgings Bureau is not very much help in finding digs within a mile radius of the col-leg e. Undoubtedly it is advantageous to live\nnear the college: besides the obvious br ne fit of having no transport fares, less time wasted\nand IPS S frustration incurred, there are the\nadditional benefits which may be obtained from\na fuller social life even eating at the Union\nin the evening affects one's whole outlook (no\nreflection on Mooney). Practically all digs\nnear I.e. are of the \"room with no meals\" type.\nMost people coming to I.C. first take up their\nabode at a \"partial board\" establishment, and\nare placed by the Bureau even as far afield as\nEaling or Hounslow. A number of these move\nnearer later in the year, and come to prefer\nhaving just a room with no meals. It is significant that those who do so seldom change\nbeck to partial board. The remark in the FELIX\nlodgings Survey that 'the tyranny of Ealing landladies is ruining I.C.\" may have a grain of\ntruth running through its facetious surface.\nThe real Solution is, of course, a a ple hostel accommodation. As this does not seem\nto be forthcoming until the far, far distant\nfuture, it is well worth paying the ex tr* to\ntake up residence in South Kensington - it is not very difficult to find a suitable room if one is prepared to take a little trouble - and\nbesides having added social ^vantages, the more\nserious side of college Life (which is all too\nimminent at present) is jade easier by having\nthe necessary libraries and laboratories oust\ndown the road.\nIn this, the final and Jubilee issue this\nterm, we reveal the identities of our regular\nnon ta de-plume):\nOur regular Nelson (so-called because of\nthe telescope he operates in the FELIX room\noverlooking Q.A.) is none other than red-beard-ed, Mephistoptiilian Did Saunders, now notorious\nas last issue's Slitor - which, incidentally,\nwas the best issue yours truly has seen for a long time.\nThe Nelson of issue 106 well-deserves his\nname now that I 've blacked his eye for organising\nthe profile on page 7 - of which, by the way,\nnot a word is true - and should know better because he is our previous Editor, John Bramley.\nHe has also masqueraded under the pseudonym of\nDaedalus for the past three issues.\nLast week's Nelson is happier with an Indian\nink pen than with a typewriter, and despite repeated at ten ps to frustrate his efforts, Pat\nBillinghflm manages to slip a cartoon or something\ninto FELIX each Issue - usually \"something\".\nFELIX is no one man's paper, and is published\nby a team - the Edi ori al Board who is led by the\nSditor. The Editor is rem mn sib le to a Board\nof Directors who are the Student Officers(sea\nBlue Book), but these latter interfere as little as possible with the x\\o ming of the paper. Let\nus hope it remains so. FELIX mas always been the\ntat Who Walked by Himself\" and has -r ovid eda platform for independent -nvs arn* no mere Unioncontrolled paper as at other colleges. It has\nhad a firm basis for doing this by being financially independent. It is becoming very difficult\nto maintain this this position, since ve ms kea total profit of 8/- on a complete sell-out of 1200\neo pies and t mta has to pay for pep mr. ink,\npencils etc. So, if yam man* year cat te keep\nem walking by himself, it lae am emt lal that ee oh person buys hj j,2S2L copy.\nLETTERS to the EDITOR WCKEH UT THE Wffit\n5 HT Sir, Wall* thanking ths gentleman viae css mf de a eat hs, \"Woman In the Bar* o a use, I as MM like to point oat that rn.it of ma htm ao\ndesire to intrude on this so palled a ale stronghold, especially if Masses \u2022ITsrtai' sad\nSeller* in their oops arc a fair example of\nwhat we ah ss&d find there..\ntoo disgusting\nfor words\"\nOf course we appreciate that soy s must\nhave somewhere in private in wh i oh_ the yo an persuade each other loudly and at length that\nthey are still masters of or eat i om.I only\nwish they would confine themselves there\nuntil they have regained their sanity.\nApparently in the last stages of inebriation\nthey are not a fit sight oven for each other\nand have to crawl away out into tha quad.,\nthus providing a public spectacle too disgusting for words.\nAs you so rightly say Mr. Carterprotect us from this pathetic sight.\nTours sincerely,\nIris Dickenson\nFootnote: Why is the hatch into the Lounge\nnot open at all times whan the bar is Open?\nAnyone buying a drink for his lady friend\nwould thus be saved the agony of getting\nthrough heavy double swing doors with both\nhands full of liquid refreshment.\nMy oar ti:^ remarks are made on o age7, but\nlet me add also, tna tif my successor has a Board\ncomposed of .\n<\n*\nuc hoe ople as named below , he\nwill li.deed br lucky; I thank them and all the\nmultitude of willing helpers too numerous to\nmention who nave come in every alternate Sunday.

For\ntoo long now, women have been deluding themselves (and the males of the human s pe oie s have been encouraging them) into thinking\nthey are the most beautiful creatures on\nearth.\nFor this, if it were true, would be\ntruly remarkable, since is it not a general\nrule in the animal kingdom that is is the\nmale of a species which has the more attractive appearance and the more beautiful\ncolouring? One only needs to look at the ducks\nin the park to realise this, and is it not\nthe bull elephant that has the larger and\nmore beautiful tusks, the male robin wh i oh has the flaming red torso, and the lion w hio hI has a mane to enhance his noble appear an oe?

The second\neight showed that they have pace, and had\nsome good racing. The third sight seamed to\nbe losing their final but pulled up to win\nby two lengths margin. Martin Gaylard had\nlittle difficulty in retaining the trophy\nwhich he won last year. These results are\nencouraging and we hops the upper Bights will be in similar winning form in the up-river\nregattas to oom a.

Wood (Austin Seven).\nATHLETICS\nSupport for the club has revived considerably im the last few mato he s. On the evening\ncf Wed. 15th. of May, we left the Union crammed into two oars heading for Parliament\nHill Fields. Back Hick's Taxi got off to an\nearly start and won easily. Tony Smith's Jalopy, in fast per suit, was delayed at\nLancaster Gate when, due to the proximity of\nthe brake and accelerator pedals, we hit the\nrear of a shooting-brake. However, tho occupants clambered out, separated the ears, and\nwith loud cheering we ware on our way again.\nJockeying with other vehicles for position\nin the centre of the road we hardly noticed\na polio em an who had to jump for his life onto\nthe pavement.\nRoyal Vet' a Coll. and Northern Polytechnic were very weak and we won easily.\nApart from N. Poly's individual winner in ths sprints we took l st. place in every\nevent.\nIn the match against St. Mary's Training\nCollege, the following Saturday, we had good\nopposition and were narrowly beaten,. The\nfinal result (65-73) was undecided until ths\nlast event (the relay) was run.\nTwo recent matches were cancelled because\nout* opponents were unable to ral s s teams.\nThere are only two more matches to be played\nbefore ear successful season closes but it is hoped that all athletes will still compete\nand we wish everyone good luck in their\nhome-club fixtures, particularly in ths\nBounty Champs, tomorrow.\nThe Athletic Club A.O.M. will be held\ntoday, Fri. May 31st., and all members are\nurged to attend.\nSAILING\nIn a match against HamDton Sailing Club\nheld on May 25th. at Hampton the club did well\nto win by 5f points taking revenge for its defeat in the winter.\nThe match was sailed in14 ft. Merlinlocket class d in gies, a new experience for\nmost of the I.C. team. The strong and very\nvariable winds provided some interesting\nsailing; crews being overpowered at times and\nshifting water.\nM. Collyer won the first race, although\nhandicapped by having the lightest crew-weight\nin the race. C. French and J.D. Webb used\ntheir length and weight effectively to go very\nfast, but were forced to retire in attempting to gain second place.\nThe second race provided even more interest\nfor crews and spectators alike. Soon after the\nstart one of the Hampton boats cap aired after\na minor collision. On the down-wind sections\nof the course M. Collyer successfully set a spinnaker, although no-one had used than '\nin the first race. Other crews followed suit -with spectacular results - as boats only just\nunder control hurtled up the river.

He may: retire\nto Les Allen's room from which advantageous\nposition he pro op ded to fling coffee over his\nArt Editor's trousers. Before dropping into a coma, Dave remarked: \" It will be alright in the morning ? \" - hence the origination of the\nterm \"to Gryff\" - to make a general nuisance of\nhimself.......for two year's holiday in the\nR.A.F. at the end of this term?

And so to end, to readers all, Best wishes for the Jubilee Ball, And for exams, the best of luck That you may always pass the buck.\nThe Editor makes no apologies for this verse as he is not the FELIX poet who\nis responsible for its Genesis and\nonly prints it so that he can save\nhimself some hard work.\nI have heard in the past many disparaging\nre a marks about meals passed by those eating\nregularly in the ref eo tory at Silwood Park. On\nthe other hand, those who have attended Touchstone Weekends have praised the food there.\nHowever, during the last three and a half\nweeks, I have been living at the Field Station\nand have studied the refectory carefully. Firstly I shall tabulate some facts and observations:\n1. \"Charges for meetings Rebates on meals\nif6 hours notice\ngiven\nBreakfast: 2/6 1/9\nLunch: 3/6 2/9\nSupper: 3/- 2/3\n2. Typioal meals during three weeks :\na) Breakfast ( i)5\" dessert plate of cereal\n(almost invariably com flakes)\n( ii) One rasher of bacon with a tablespoonful of baked beans or two boiled eggs.\n(Occasional variation: a boiled kipper; two\nsausages and beans, or two sardines on toast).\n( iii) urn tea, toast (grudgingly\ngiven), marmalade.\nb) Lunch ( i) Soup - 5 ladle ful.( ii) Roast beef or lamb (usually\nwell cooked), mashed potatoes and one other vegetable (usually cabbage, occasionally leaks or\npeas).\n( iii) Dessert - about 2d. worth of\nice-cream and one wafer, or a small portion of\nfruit and custard or meringue.\no) Supper (t)2 small sausages and mashed\npotatoes, cr 2 poached eggs on toast, or 2 sausages (small) chips and half a tomato.\n( ii) Dessert - an apple or an\norange or a piece of cake, or sweet as at lunch,\nor cheap chad dar cheese and two biscuits, NO tea.\n3. The meal times are often inconvenient and the\neaters are made to hurry by the Manager who has\nbeen seen to put the refectory clock back before\na meal - perhaps it was not ready - and then put\nit forward again during the meal. At weekends\nstudents are expected to wash up their own crock-e ry.4.A waitress service is especially laid on for\nTouchstone Weekends but the normal resident has\neven to do his own washing up on Saturdays and\nSundays. The standard of food varies considerably from good food for Touchstone, reasonable\nfood for engineering field courses to a mere\nsubsistence for residents. The main bulk of\nthe food for the latter i a provided by bread\nand jam.\n5. The Refectory Committee is composed of the\nfollowing:-Hr. Savage - in charge of Silwood Park - who\nnever eats in the Refectory.\nTwo members of staff, one who goes home for\nlunch and one who comes in rarely to find a temporary marked improvement.\nTwo student members, one who has never been\nseen in the Refectory, and the President of Sil wood Park Committee.\nI would like to add to these facts some\nsuggestions and comments:\n1. In the opinion of the majority of refectory\nusers, the present manager baa never been sat-is factory. He has now resigned and should have\nbeen asked to do so long ago.\nI suggest that at tha moment th* Refectory\nis grossly over staffed, and I further think\nteat two cooks, instead of three, with an Assistant and no Refectory Manager would be sufficient. Also, if these could be recruited from\none of the colleges of domestic science, then\nsot only would their wage* be less aa a result\nof both being Inexperienced and also female\nthey could live in the hostel, or th* vacated\nflat of tb* present manager - and would be ia\ncontact of the consumers. Perhaps they would\nalso be allowed to uae Onion facilities.\n2. It appear* ridiculous that th* majority of\nthe members of the Refectory Committee do not\nas* the Refectory. I would suggest that at\nleast three of the five ba elected from the\no one u as rs. Qantinued in time next oo ln an. The sun is shining, the windows are\nclean and on this oo casio n of a second\nvisit from our Royal Visitor, Nelson is fed up with being nasty and niggling. To\n-hell with the tradition of the job, the\ncolumn is going to be NICE.\nThree cheers for the landscape gardeners who have shown that a job o an be\ndone on time with impeccable workmanship.\nEven those who regretted the passing of\nthe tennis o our ts are impressed.\nCongratulations to Jennifer Heywood\non her election as Queen of dis-May\nlong may the Icwamazons thrive under her\nleadership. To aid her in the more\nimportant aide of her work, I have a wide\nmouthed kettle, taw o canvas buckets and a dis\u2014used oil drum which may well be useful.\nAnd three cheers for the fact that\nthe dreaded Wendy Pipe has been laid low -but, no - lets be nice. One cheer for\nWendy Pipe.\nSince the I. C.W. A. common room is to have its fish-tank, one begins to see\nthe idea behind those who wish to form a Sub-Aqua Club. Is there no length to\nwhich the virile I.C. male will not go in its hunt for the quarry ? Anyway, three\ncheers.\nA special cheer for all the ladies\nwho remove the traces of'sport'from\nour1 surroundings in tha mornings after.\nLong may they continue to sweep deftly\naround the \"incapable s\", restoring order\nto what seems, in the mo ring at any rate,\nto be a rather squalid chaos.\nA very big hurray for tha Entertainments committee. As their year comes to\na close, the column ie thankful for those\nwho spend a considerable amount of time and\nenergy on a job with little kudos. Their\n'piece de resistance', the Jubilee Ball, is ty pio al of the large scale of their ent-erp rises. And tha loudest cheer in this\ncase is a helping hand for Richard Garnett\nand co.. Being forced to a niggle by \"the boss\"\nthe column finds itself having to say -'hurray'for those who came back from the\nTouchstone week-end by coach. Apparent iy a lot of those who went came back by other\nmeans and wasted the coach - I suppose\nwe shall have to have'a little 'boo' for them.\nAs a last glorious, generous gesture,\nHurray for the readers of Felix, for the\nEditor and tha i Jo meet lc Bursar.\nFELIX SUBSCRIPTION\n7/6 per year.\nI wish to subscribe to FELIX for one year.\nHeme\nAddress\nWTEWFOIBT .... continued.\n3. Silwood Park grows a large quantity of vegetables, surely a little co-operation between the\ncooks and Head Gardener would give a chee per source of food.\n4. In the past, the Refectory Coaaittee, or at\nleast soma member* of it, have tried to change\nthings. One gate the impression that red tape\nand inefficiency In tb* collage ao a la let ze tl on rather ti** their hands.\nLeo Palmer.\n\n"
