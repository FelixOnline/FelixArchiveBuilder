So if\nthere\u2019s a film you just can\u2019t stop talking about, a movie that inspires\nyou, a feature that changed your life or one that is your only remedy\nfor a miserable day, we would love you to write about it and have\nthe guts to share it with the rest of Imperial, whether you are a\nstudent or a lecturer.\nPlease send a few hundred words about the film you love to:\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHHKKK Stefan Carpanu\nI saw The Reader without realising that\nit\u2019s an adaptation of a book by Bernhard Schlink and maybe allowed me to\nwatch the movie with an unprejudiced\nand unexpectant eye, and that is why I\nfound myself loving it for what it is, not\nbeing disappointed by what it isn\u2019t.\nThe main premise of the film is a love\naffair in post-war Germany between\na 15 year-old Michael Berg (David\nKross) and a much older, single and\nslightly mysterious Hanna Schmitz\n(Kate Winslet).\nThe affair only lasts for a summer\nbut the episode is one that leaves a\nlasting mark on Michael and his whole\nlife. This is because Michael does not\nonly have to deal with the heartbreak\ncaused by Hanna leaving him, but\nmore importantly with the fact that,\nas it turns out, she was a female guard\nin the concentration camps in Poland,\nseemingly responsible for the deaths of\nhundreds.\nI use the word \u2018seemingly\u2019 deliberate-ly, and this \u2018seemingly\u2019 is at the heart\nof what makes The Reader so striking.\nStephen Daldry and Kate Winslet have\nachieved something amazing \u2013 in the\nfilm they weave a story that manipulates and jumbles the audience\u2019s feelings and thoughts so that on leaving the\ncinema you\u2019re one great bundle of confused emotions, not knowing whether\nto stick to your old, hard-set morals, or\nto give in to the view of people as being\ngrey and never black and white.\nWhat\u2019s absolutely brilliant about the\nfilm is that up front it can be seen simply as a love story, but if you analyse\nthe feelings it extricates and you realise that you\u2019re sympathising with the\nwrong characters, then you\u2019ll understand on your own skin what a moral\ndilemma actually is.\nThey cannot be talking about the same movie...\nCritically acclaimed, nominated for 5 Oscars including Best Picture, The Reader left some of us in felix Film\nvisibly impressed, while others were left wondering at Hollywood\u2019s power to ruin a perfectly good book.\nHanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) has an unexplained obsession with\nbeing read to. When Fiennes does the reading who\u2019s to blame her?\nHHHHK Zuzanna Blaszczak\nFilm Editor\nIt\u2019s a weird day and age we\u2019re living\nin. Films are being remade only one\nyear after the originals are released\nsimply to suit the \u201cAmerican\u201d market\n(whereby American really means anyone who\u2019d rather watch a film in the\nEnglish language), Uwe Boll is still in\nthe movie business, Jean Claude Van\nDamme has received his first \u201cfresh\u201d\nrating from Rottentomatoes and Hollywood\u2019s policy of sticking its nose in\nHolocaust films remains unchanged.\nHow ironic is it that a film based\non a book that deals primarily with\nthe question of the German issue of\nguilt over World War II is produced\nby Americans, directed by the British,\nand acted out by a cast full of German\nactors, only for all of them to be speaking English? Actually, the manner in\nwhich words are coated with shady accents best symbolises the fundamental\nproblem of The Reader: it\u2019s well shot,\nwell acted and nicely put together \u2013\nand that\u2019s about it. The source material amounts to an involving read and\nBernhard Schlink\u2019s book is an intriguingly effective tale of alienation and\ndiscovery, which hides at its core an\nissue that could truly amount to being the cornerstone of an exceptional\nfilm. Stephen Daldry chooses though\nto focus on the story of Michael and\nHannah, thereby reducing both the\nscope and the depth of the underlying theme, pertaining to the fate of the\nGerman people as a whole. The search\nfor a sympathetic character, which\nHannah is anyway given her predica-ment, is overstressed and diminishes\nthe impact of several key scenes, as\nif it isn\u2019t allowed to portray a morally\nambiguous (and oblivious) person onscreen without neatly cutting off the\nedges and flattening it to a comfortable\ndegree. Moreover, when it tries to be\nsmart, it simply spits out a bunch of\ndelicate questions, just to drown them\nin either silence or sentimentalism.\nIt might be that as a reader of the\nbook, I longed to see more of its interesting half and less of its rather conventional part. Fact is, Ralph Fiennes, Kate\nWinslet and David Kross apply themselves well in portraying their charac-ters, and the interpersonal level of the\nfilm is fairly satisfying. A fine soundtrack emphasises the story\u2019s emotions,\nbut in truth, The Reader could have\nbeen so powerful that any soundtrack\nwould have been muted by the events\nunfolding on screen. As it stands, it is\nlittle more than an adequate drama of\nvague interest.\nAs soon as I had bought my ticket, the\nman at the box office handed me some\nstylish and cool-looking, plastic 3D\nglasses. I was so excited! So was everyone else. We waited nervously through\nthe adverts and trailers, until finally\na huge sign appeared on the cinema\nscreen that read \u2018Please put on your\n3D glasses\u2019. Everyone ripped them out\nof their plastic cases and shoved them\nonto their face and in a matter of seconds the film company logo flashed on\nthe screen, cogs turning and letters fly-ing: all in amazing 3D! The audience let\nout screams of delight as the opening\ncredits flew towards us, and from that\npoint on we were all captivated.\nOkay, so I have seen a 3D film be-fore. It isn\u2019t something new. In fact it\nhas been around commercially since\nthe 50s. But with dwindling moviego-ers, Hollywood has had to try to make\na special gimmick in order to get audiences back inside theatres and 3D is\nthe one they have chosen. But this is a\nnew style of 3D: it is Real-D, a special\nsystem that does not need two projectors like conventional 3D films and\nthis means that normal cinemas can\nget these special projectors, hand out\n3D glasses and everyone can enjoy the\n3D action.\nIt has to be noted that My Bloody Valentine is the first-ever 18-rated movie\nmade in 3D and, boy, does it earn\nthat certificate. This is an extremely\ngory, splatter film and if you are easily squeamish, I would not recommend\nit. Within the first 5 minutes there is\na hospital full of murder victims: their\nchests ripped open having had their\nhearts pulled out by a pickaxe-wielding\npsychopath. It seems that a cave-in in\nthe local mine has driven him insane\nand since it happened on Valentine\u2019s\nDay, he just couldn\u2019t help but be festive\nand so go on a killing frenzy. But once\nhis 15-minute murder spree \u2013 one that\ninvolves heads and eyeballs flying towards the camera \u2013 is over, we move to\n10 years later when the murders begin\nagain. But can the same man be behind\nit? Or is it a copycat?\nThe plot is fairly lame but this is a\nhorror movie \u2013 a remake of a Canadian\nfilm of the same name, and you can\u2019t\nescape the fact that most horrors do\nnot have astounding or original plots.\nBut what it lacks in realism and character development, it makes up for in\nviolence and this never seems to end.\nThe film utilises its 3D-ness to amazing effect \u2013 pickaxes fly at you, blood\nsprays at you, even a severed jaw is\nthrown directly at the camera. The\nsplatter is sometimes just a bit too\nmuch but it really suits the 3D style\nof the film, so the audience can just\nabout forgive the overall nastiness of\nthe movie.\nThere is one brilliant scene involving\nsex, a mirror, a midget, a completely\nnaked woman running around a parking lot and, of course, the murderer\nand his pickaxe. You just have to see it\nto believe it!\nThe reason I gave this film 3 stars is\nbecause it is not a great film, it is just\nstandard stupid horror fare and so the\nfilm actually earns 2 stars. In years to\ncome it will probably be remembered\nfor being the first of its kind, but for\nMy Bloody Valentine 3-D\nHHHKK\nDirector: Patrick Lussier\nWriter: Todd Farmer et. al\nCast: Jensen Ackles,\nJamie King,\nKerr Smith\nJonathan Dakin\nFilm Editor\nnothing else except for the fact it was\nreally grisly. The extra star is for the\n3D, because it works so well.\nI would highly recommend all horror\nfans to watch this film, as they would\nprobably love it.\nBut for those of you who can\u2019t stand\nseeing people\u2019s heads being forced\nonto the blade of a pickaxe, I would\nwait until the 3D films that are suitable\nfor children come out later in the year.\nThen you can truly enjoy the awesome-ness of 3D, without holding your hands\nover your face in fear.\nAs soon as the credits rolled, everyone let out words of amazement. I\nleft the cinema smiling \u2013 3D had won\nme over!! Has the novelty of the film\nbrought people back into cinemas?\nWell the fact that my screening of\nthe film was packed and so was the\nnext one, judging by the queue as I\nwas leaving, it proves that people are\nkeen to see Hollywood\u2019s new gimmick.\nEither that or people are just bloody\ndisgusting.\nBloody, gritty, gory and scary... and also in 3-D!\nHave you ever wondered if Jensen Ackles looks as amazing in 3D?\nBased on a self-help book that all\nwomen seem to know was once used\nin an episode of Sex And The City, He\u2019s\nJust Not That Into You is a romantic\ncomedy that chronicles many different\npeople and their attempts at relation-ships. Set around Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin from Walk The Line), a woman\nwho keeps misunderstanding men and\nhow interested they are in her, she asks\na local barman (Justin Long, appeared\nin Die Hard 4) for help on how to understand men better.\nOther plots include a married couple who are going through a rough\npatch and a couple who decide that\nthey should break-up because the man\ndoesn\u2019t want to marry the woman. The\nfilm has a stellar cast including Jennifer Aniston, Drew Barrymore, Ben Affleck, Scarlett Johansson and Jennifer\nConnelly to name a few.\nItseemslikethisfilmisaimedatthose\nwho saw Sex And The City: The Movie,\nas I am sure everyone in this film will\nlearn about life, but most importantly,\nlove (cheesy!). And they said the chick\nflick was dead! So if you love schmaltzy\nrom-coms, or need some lessons in\nrelationships (although film felix cannot guarantee you will be taught them\nfrom this) then He\u2019s Just Not That Into\nYou is the movie for you!\nMilk is the inspirational story of gay\nrights campaigner, Harvey Milk, which\nhas been nominated for numerous\nawards, including the Oscar for Best\nFilm. It follows the final eight years of\nHarveyMilk\u2019slifeandisfocusedaround\na recording he made, to be played only\nin the event of his assassination. During these years, he embarked on a campaign for gay rights in America, driven\nby the phrase \u201cMy name is Harvey\nMilk and I want to recruit you\u201d and,\nafter several attempts, he became the\nfirst openly gay man to be voted into a\nposition in public office.\nThe film is heavily informed by the\nOscar-winning documentary The\nTimes of Harvey Milk (1984). The long\nlist of friends and family acknowledged\nin the credits, as well as the historical\nconsultation of at least two of the main\ncharacters, demonstrate how well researched the film is. However, director Gus Van Sant (Good Will Hunting),\ndoes not simply deliver an informative\nhistorical drama. We also gain insight\ninto the personal life of this inspirational man, making him human and engag-ing. This is supported by a believable\nand emotive performance from Sean\nPenn (Mystic River, 21 Grams), which\nhas earned him an Oscar nomination\nfor Best Actor, as well as a superb supporting cast.\nAs with any film based around such\nRecruits needed: Milk\nwants you! (not in that way)\na powerful story, it would be easy to\nassume that this is enough for suc-cess. However, Van Sant does not give\nin to such complacency and combines\ncareful research with a brilliant cast to\nproduce a thoroughly moving film. My\nadvice is to go armed with a large supply of tissues.\nJonathan Dakin\nFilm Editor\nApparently he was married to Madonna once (Penn not Milk) - WTF?\nCatherine Luckin\n\u0001\nWhat does the scheme entail?\n\uf0ab Undergraduates/Postgraduates undertaking a 3 week placement in June/July\nin a school/college\n\uf0ab Working alongside experienced teachers and assisting in classroom teaching\n\uf0ab Groups of up to 10 students can be placed in one school\n\uf0ab Placements arranged by Exscitec\nWhat are the benefits of the scheme?\n\uf0fc Receive a \u00a3600 tax free bursary for completing the 15 day placement\n\uf0fc Receive a free CRB Disclosure check\n\uf0fc Have something different for your CV\n\uf0fc Develop new transferable skills and communication experience\n\uf0fc Gain first hand experience of what a career in teaching involves\nSupport secondary school Maths, Physics or Chemistry in London\nFor more information or to apply contact Sarah Cooper: Pre-requisites : A- Levels in Maths, Physics or Chemistry\nsarah.cooper@exscitec.com\n01730 235683\nLinks : www.tda.gov.uk / www.imperial.ac.uk/outreach / www.exscitec.com\nStudent Associates Scheme (SAS)\nStudent Associates Scheme (SAS)\nThe majority of placements are in the London Region \u2013 Placements outside\nLondon can be accommodated by request\n\n"

But this most recent military offensive by the Sri Lankan government has pushed the Tamil Tigers and civilians living in those areas back into\nan ever-shrinking corner.\nClaims by the Sri Lankan government that there have been \u2018zero civilian\ncasualties\u2019 have been met with scepticism by the Red Cross and other aid\ngroups who say shells fired by the army have landed in a 35 square kilometre\nno-fire zone where thousands of civilians have gathered for safety.

Furthering the suspicion, Live!\nEditor Kirsty Patterson additionally exposed Union server security measures\nby accessing files from the Live! Editor\nCollege account. Though the Union directory is normally hidden from view\non supposedly non-privileged College\naccounts, basic mapping functions\nwere able to locate these folders and\nfiles, and hence readily available to any\nstaff or students.\nThe most alarming folder lacking\nsuitable permissions were those designated to the Union General Manager,\ncurrently Peter Haldane. Within this\nfolder, confidential documents relating to named disciplinary and written\nwarnings were found. Folders entitled \u2018Staffing\u2019 and \u2018Finance\u2019 contained\nUnion staff contracts and payroll\nspecifics.\nScreenshots on live.cgcu.net show\nthe extent of access Patterson had.

These elections are being seen as an important test for the\ncountry\u2019s young democratic\npolitical system which was established after the war in 2003,\nas well as for the performance\nof the Iraqi Army and Police in\nkeeping voters safe.\nSaturday is also widely seen as\na precursor to national elections\nto be held at the end of 2009,\nwhich will mark the completion\nof a full 4-year term of Prime\nMinister Nouri al-Maliki\u2019s government which was formed after the last national election in\nDecember 2005.\nIraq\nZimbabwe\nThe cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe has now caused more than 3,000\ndeaths according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), a body of\nthe UN.\nThe water-borne disease has affected larger and larger areas of Zimbabwe\nsince August 2008, a result of the collapsing water, sanitation and public\nhealth system.

The power sharing deal will see Mugabe remain as president\nwhile Tsvangirai assumes the position of prime minister.

Imperial College Riding\n1st Team were busy getting ready for\ntheir first competition of the season.\nBeing a home competition at Trent\nPark Equestrian Centre (one stop from\nthe famous Cockfosters station) the\npressure was on the IC riders to perform their best.\nIn the dressage phase (aka ballet\nfor horses) we were drawn to go first\nwith Trisna Tungadi the first rider in\nthe arena on our secret weapon Chess.\nUnfortunately we had been hoping she\nwould be the last rider on him as, ever\nthe exuberant horse, Chess goes better\nthe more time there is to wear him out!\nSadly he remained as lively as ever, not\nhelped by someone scaring him moments before they went in to do their\ntest. Nevertheless, an admirable performance saw Trisna lying in 6th place\nafter the dressage.\nMy horse James & I did not fare so\nwell, finding the photographer particularly spooky and, like Trisna, I felt I\nwould have benefited from being a later rider on him to allow him more time\nto settle. A disappointing performance\nsaw me lying 10th individually after the\ndressage. Thankfully Kathleen Duclos\non Phoebe and our team captain Andr\u00e9 Wilmes on Smithy rode fabulous\nrounds, with Andr\u00e9 easily lying in first\nplace individually after the dressage.\nGoing into the showjumping we were\nin first place as a team and had high\nhopes of success. Andr\u00e9 was the first\nIC rider to jump and one pole down\nleft him briefly concerned until he saw\nthe other riders on Dan also suffer similar fates. Good rounds from Trisna on\nCharm and Kathleen (who managed to\nput aside her nerves of falling off the\nbig jumping Abbey) meant a win for\nImperial was inevitable. With only the\ntop 3 scores from each team counting,\nthe team results were already decided\nand my jumping round was a mere\nformality. Nevertheless, riding speed-machine Trio, I managed to jump the\nonly clear round of the IC team.\nWith obvious jubilation for winning\nour home competition (and thus one\nstep closer to regional qualification) it\nwas also great to discover the success\nof individuals. Kathleen and Trisna\nfinished 5th and 6th respectively and\nAndr\u00e9 wowed the other competitors so\nmuch that they felt the need to double-check his very high score before confirming his individual win.\nAfter disappointment in previous\nyears at the home competitions, it was\ngreat to see IC Riding back on top form\nand we now have high hopes for our\nremaining two competitions before the\nregional qualifying teams are decided\nin the near future.\nThe white horse manages to clear the fence with ease\nIC Riding 1st team kicks off\nthe season well\nChlo\u00e9 Sharrocks\n(ed - For brownie points, can you spot\nthe 10 aviation themes in the article?)\nFollowing the unbeaten run in 2009,\nICUAFC 4th XI have shed last year\u2019s\nbaggage, reclaiming their rightful position at the top of Division 1. With soaring confidence and Holloway failing to\nput up little resistance this one was a\ntruly one sided game.\nIt was Holloway, however, who drew\nfirst blood with an early goal ten minutes into the game where a sliced cross\nfrom a man who had slipped under the\nradar crept in at the back post.\nHowever Imperial controlled the remainder of the half and Deen, recently\ncompared to Diego Tristan, steadily\nbuilt towards a remarkable average of\n2 goals per game netting a first half\nhat-trick.\nMamzi, Marc and Rich also produced goals straight from the top\ndrawer, adding their names to the rapidly growing score sheet. Imperial finished the first half a staggering 6-1 up\nagainst Holloway.\nCaptain Jeremy painted a debonair\nportrait on the touchline as his tactical\ndecisions, which have been previously\ncriticised for the way he throws subs\non at half-time, paid dividends as fresh\nlegs on the wings from French Jeremy\nand Ciaran continued to cause their\nfull backs (one nicknamed \u2018Ghandi\u2019,\npresumably because he too was shit at\nfootball) problems.\nJohnny Hill and Deen added to the\nImperial 4ths vs Holloweiii!\nJames Skeen\nFootball\nImperial Men\u2019s 4th XI 8\nRoyal Holloway 4th XI 1\nIC 4s march on to ULU Cup quarter finals with run-a-way\nvictory at Fortress Harlington against Holloway 4s\nSBM Photographic (http://www.sbmphotographic.co.uk)\nThis can only mean two things: Hyde\nPark relays and Valentines Day. Unfortunately this year they fall on the same\nday (14 February, just to spell it out)\nbut since if you are reading this, you\nprobably go to Imperial, it\u2019s not a hard\nchoice really is it?\nFor those of you who haven\u2019t heard of\nthe Hyde Park relays, it\u2019s a yearly event\nwhere teams take it in turns to run\nround Hyde park, in an attempt to get\nthe lowest total time.

Oh no! There\nis a meal afterwards, complete with a\nparty in the union. Style not needed.\nTo all these fun events we add about\n800 foreign students (including some\nlovely Italian men for your consump-tion) and students from other univer-sities! Men - this means more women!\nWomen - this means less geeky men!\nWhat have you got to lose, apart from\na few pounds?\nFor the women\u2019s teams you need\nfour runners running 3km each, and\nfor mixed and men\u2019s teams your team\nmust have six runners running 5km\neach.\nTo register go online to http://www.\nimperialcollegeunion.com/cross-country-71/category.html\nSo this February, instead of doing\nsomething with the one you love (your\nhand doesn\u2019t count) come run and have\na laugh in Hyde park!\nTom Ward\nCornish beasting out 5km in last years epic HPR (final time of 23.01)\nJ.

Write to us.\nclubsandsocs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nClubs & Socs Editor - Alice Rowlands\nIC Winds concert blows us away\nAnna Gooding reports on the Coldstream Guards band and IC Wind bands power performance\nI\nmperial College Winds is a\ngroup of enthusiastic brass,\nwoodwind and percussion\nplayers who meet weekly to\nrehearse. The music we play\nranges from folk songs, film scores and\nmarches, to concertos and beyond. So\nfar this term we have been concentrating on the Wind Power repertoire but\nour concert on the 24th of March will\ninclude Philip Sparke\u2019s A Lindisfarne\nRhapsody which will feature our principal flautist Phin Chooi.\nIn September one of our trumpeters,\nMel Tamplin (a member of staff in the\nCollege), had the idea of arranging a\nworkshop day with a professional wind\nband. He contacted The Coldstream\nGuards who agreed to come down to\nImperial and spend a day teaching us\nall they know! He mentioned the plan\nto friends and other staff colleagues,\nand what had started as a small event\nescalated into the exciting spectacle\nthat took over the College on Wednesday night.\nThe Coldstream Regiment of Foot\nGuards is the oldest corps by continuous existence in the British Army, having been formed in 1650. The band\nof the Coldstream Guards performs\nregularly at state ceremonial events\nacross London and beyond, and has\njust recently returned from a tour of\nthe United States of America. Due to a\nwealth of talented musicians, the band\ncan appear as a small fanfare team, a\nmarching band, a jazz band or, as was\nseen on Wednesday, a wind band. The\nband is directed by Lieutenant Colonel\nGraham Jones MBE who lead Wednesday\u2019s afternoon rehearsal and evening\nconcert, as well as having joined us\nat two Tuesday evening rehearsals\npreviously.\nThe day began with intimate rehearsals in small sections based in the\nUnion and in the Blyth Centre. Some\nof our band members even managed\nto have one-on-one tuition with a professional musician. At lunchtime six of\nthe Guards performed three fanfares,\ntwo on Dalby court and one under the\nQueen\u2019s Tower. We stood back and\nwatched in awe whilst selling tickets for the evening\u2019s concert to other\nequally impressed staff and students.\nIn the afternoon we all joined together\nand rehearsed en masse in the Great\nHall. As the two full-size wind bands\ncame together, there were around sixty\nplayers on one stage and we made a\ntruly formidable sound.\nThe concert began at 6.30 with the\nGuards looking very smart in their superb red uniforms and IC Winds dolled\nup in their Wind Power T-shirts. Lieutenant Colonel Graham Jones joined\nus on stage wearing an all black uniform with white gloves and donned\nwith medals. We opened with HRH\nDuke of Cambridge March: an uplift-ing, jolly march which set the scene\nfor the concert. The programme took\na lighter turn with Echoes of an Era\nwhich featured several popular Beatles\nhits including With a Little Help From\nmy Friends, When I\u2019m Sixty-four,\nMichelle, Yellow Submarine and Hey\nJude. The arrangement showed that\nBeatles music really has stood the test\nof time, with the audience appreciating\neach popular and familiar tune. This\nwas followed by Imperial Echoes a\nshort march which was chosen for the\nevening\u2019s performance to represent\nthe new link between the Band of The\nColdstream Guards and Imperial College London.\nThe next piece was an arrangement\nof Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish and\nEnglish traditional tunes - A Very British Tribute. The selection included\nDanny Boy, Londonderry Air, World\nin Union and I Vow to Thee My Country. The arrangement was written by\nthe Guards\u2019 band master and featured\na tremendous male vocal solo. Lord\nProfessor Robert Winston was then invited up on stage to join the band for\nMy Funny Valentine on his alto saxo-phone. This arrangement was a real\ntrombone show-piece which featured\nthe Guards\u2019 principal trombonist Colour Sergeant David Desmond.\nNext jazz singer Victoria Hart joined\nus to perform a selection of three\npieces from her new album, \u2018The Lost\nGershwin\u2019. Victoria Hart has become\naffectionately known as the \u201cSinging\nWaitress\u201d due to exchanging her job\nin a restaurant for performing in front\nof George Clooney at a Cannes party.\nHer music is described as pop, with\ninfluence from the 40s and 50s swing\nera. She performs at various jazz festivals and has appeared at Glastonbury\nFestival. The selection we played on\nWednesday was from her new album\nwhich is a collection of rare Gershwin\nsongs. She sang beautifully and looked\nextraordinarily glamorous in a slinky\nlong black number.\nCossack Fire Dance was a real crowd\npleaser, featuring several amazingly\ntalented soloists including a clarinet,\na euphonium, a trumpet and a trom-bone. It was an exciting and enjoyable\npiece and the audience joined in with\nsome enthusiastic clapping! A fantastic rendition of Crown Imperial ended\nwith an organ solo which filled the\nwhole room with a sense of grandeur.\nThe piece has been played at the Coronation of King George VI and that of\nQueen Elizabeth II, and now at Imperial College London!\nFinally the concert closed with the\ntraditional play-off for the band of the\nColdstream Guards, the Regimental\nMarch, representing the link between\nthe band and the regiment, followed\nby The National Anthem. The guests\ndeparted from the Great Hall buzzing\nwith enthusiasm for wind bands and\nmusic in Imperial College!\nA few lucky members of the band\nmade their way to the Tanaka Foyer\nwhere they were wined and dined\nin true Imperial style. Lord Professor Robert Winston rounded off the\nevening with a particularly amusing\nand memorable speech. Meanwhile, in\nthe SCR, the rest of the musicians were\nhaving a real knees-up with a fantastic\nmeal laid on by the same team. Finally,\nafter a very long and tiring day of rehearsals and socialising, we all made\nour way home for some well earned\nrest.\nAll-in-all the day was a huge success,\nfrom rehearsals to concert to dinner.\nThe concert was attended by over 350\npeople who came and enjoyed the results of our labours. The money raised\nwill be used to provide a music scholarship for an Imperial College student\nwhich will be known as the Coldstream\nGuards Scholarship.\nIC Winds would like to thank Mel\nTamplin for his vision, dedication and\nenthusiasm, the College Events team\nfor putting together such a wonderful\nday and of course Lieutenant Colonel Graham Jones and the band of\nthe Coldstream Guards for coming to\nshare their expertise with us.\nTo see video clips and read more\nabout Wind Power, visit www.impe-rial.ac.uk/news.

There was one\nword which stuck out: storm.\nAnd yes there it was, a giant\nwhite twirly thing approaching Wales\nfrom Ireland.\nThis thought was momentarily forgotten as I met friends old and new\nat the union and we prepared for de-parture. Nathaniel then revealed his\n\u2018brilliant idea\u2019 and said that because of\nthe greater numbers of people on the\ntrip, we would be strapping our bags to\nthe roof-rack, secured with a tarpaulin\ncalled Gilbert and a set of straps called\nBloody-Difficult-To-Use. It was a good\nidea for the windless streets of London\nand gave us much needed room in the\nminibus for the 6-hour trip. The dinner\nbreak in Warwick was characteristic of\nthe fellwanderers in that food was followed by an urgent trip to stock up on\nalcohol and chocolate.\nArriving at the hut at 1:30am, after\nminimum problems getting visas at the\nheavily-guarded Welsh border, suddenly Gilbert became our foe. In strong\nwind and driving rain, Chris and myself\nclimbed onto the roof to undo BloodyDifficult-To-Use and toss off Gilbert to\nget at the bags. In the space of 5 minutes all the bags were wet. There then\nfollowed the several rituals of turning\nround the minibus, finding beds and\nmaking tea.\nThe Saturday morning greeted us\nwith driving wind and low cloud. We\nwere doing the Nantlle Ridge behind\nthe hut and within walking distance,.\nThe surrounding mountains were suitable eerie as we gathered outside to\nstart the walk. Cloud obscured everything more than 200m above our heads\nand the dampened light brought out\nthe cracks in the rocks and the nearby\nhouses. It was not raining but everything was damp, the kind that gets to\nyou straight away. Dom had other plans\nand wore 7 layers to keep warm, which\nquickly reduced him into a sweating\nwreck which was de-clothed as quickly\nas possible.\nOur ascent up to the ridge into the\ncloud was steep. Gavin compensated\nfor tiredness and cold by bringing out\na bottle of port and hurriedly opening\nit. This and Jim\u2019s Father Christmas hat\ngave us a festive look which was a brave\neffort since we saw hardly anyone else\non the hill that day. Once in the cloud\nwe were relying on the maps and eventually found our way up a grassy slope\nto the lunch spot inside a walled circular pen. Everyone held their breath as\nJim tried the fig jelly which somehow\nhad found its way into the rations, but\nhe gave it the thumbs up. The lunch\nbreak was followed by a scramble along\na ridge, using wet rocks as hand-holds\nand creeping along through the strong\nwind. The views sometimes cleared\ndown to the valley, but mostly the only\nvision we had was grey streaking past\nand whistling through the rocks.\nWe descended out of the clouds into\na forest, which was a welcome change\nfrom the sodden grass of the hills. Our\ncourse followed a clever idea that some\ncrazy hill-person thought up to annoy\neveryone else \u2013 the stream and the path\nwere the same thing. After descending\nthis with much slipping, we eventually found a proper path which took us\nthrough the woods and back onto the\nhillside. And there it was, in the dis-tance; the pub. The warm fire and local ales immediately took the damp out\nof us and the group soon divided into\nthose who got puddings, and those\nwho simply fell asleep. A quick drive\nback, beautiful cooking by several \u2018volunteers\u2019 under the whip of Charlie, and\nthe tutoring of the club in Australian\ncard games, took us into the night. After a few hours of sweltering under the\nheat of the stove which was burning at\na balmy billion degrees Celsius, everyone slowly drifted off to bed.\nOn Sunday we tried to do the Glyders. It was the shortest day of the year.\nFor those that do not know the Glyders,\nthey are a few mountains which form\na ridge several miles long and have\nsome of the most beautiful views in\nSnowdonia. Their peaks are covered in\nthousands of boulders littered around\nlike shattered egg-shell and which\nmake even the calmest days seem mys-tical. This was not a calm day.\nWe got up onto the ridge via the\nDevil\u2019s Kitchen, a beautiful climb up a\ncliff surrounded by the black buttresses of the Glyders and Y Garn. At this\npoint the wind had not picked up and\nthe climb had a very lord-of-the-rings\nfeel as the cloud came down to meet\nus. This led to some classic discussions\nas to who would be the group Golum,\nwhich I will not repeat here. It would\nhave been easy to believe we were in\nmiddle earth as we saw no one else\non the hills, except for a giant spider\ncalled Shelob that had to be defeated\nbefore lunch.\nThe rocks, sky and grass were a\nsoggy grey and soon we were too. As\nthe group stretched out we lost ourselves in the mist and all too often, all\nI could see of the others were darker\npatches in the dark grey, in front and\nbehind. The wind was the worst part,\nand by lunchtime we were pretty damn\nmiserable. A few of us got warmed up\nby climbing over the top of Castell y\nGwynt, a picturesque of somewhat\nabsurdly dangerous rock formation\nabove a thousand foot drop. This led\nto the sensible decision to get off the\nmountains as fast as we could. Chris,\nmap in hand, led the charge with the\nbattle-cry of a hardened hill-walker\nand strode off down a slope. Soon we\nwere all lost. This wasn\u2019t actually Chris\u2019\nfault but a more general joint fuck-up\nby all the map readers, and the problem that what was meant to be a slope\nwas actually flat.\nWe gave ourselves confidence by\nmurmuring \u2018I think it should be a bit\nmore to the left\u2019 and eventually found\nthe lake which meant we had gone too\nfar. It was only a matter of tracking\nback a bit to find the path down top\nthe valley, and we were finally on our\nway out of the cloud. Spirits perked as\nwe descended and began to get a view\nof the road far beneath us, the happiest\nI have ever been to see a car.\nTwo hours later and we were safely\ninstalled in a caf\u00e9 in Capel Curig which\nhad hot chocolate and cake, and whose\nshop stocked more wine than anything\nelse. We all slowly warmed up. That\nnight was much like the last and involved us being visited by werewolves\nfrom Moldova and Austria. I am\npleased to say we used the shortest day\nof the year well.\nMonday was our last day in Wales\nand the morning was spent packing and loading up the minibus. This\nmeant the annoying task of replacing\nthe batteries of all the fire alarms that\ngo off regardless of whether there is a\nfire or not. We managed to finish this\nin good time, and Nathaniel returned\nfrom driving Heike to the station, looking surprisingly perky from having got\nup at 4:30am.\nIt was a short drive to Llanberis from\nwhere we would be starting our last\nwalk. The Pete\u2019s Eats Caf\u00e9 was open\nand welcoming but, true hill-walkers,\nwe went straight past it and wandered\nthrough some fields towards a hill next\nto Snowdon. The prospect of walking\nstraight into a caf\u00e9 upon our return\ngave us the needed inspiration to go\nback up into the grey mass that hung\nabove us. Our approach to the hill was\neasy enough, with views back down to\nLlanberis and of the lowest few hundred metres of Snowdon. The plan had\nbeen to climb up to the ridge via a scree\nslope which looked good on the map.\nWhat we had not realised was that between us and the scree slope was a bog,\ncrossed by several streams flowing into\nthe lake at the base of Snowdon. This\nseemed like a bad idea for the final day\nbefore a long drive back to London, so\ninstead we went straight up the steep\nhill to our right which would eventually lead to the summit we were aiming for. Covering this slope was our\nold friend Gorse, which was helpfully\nspiky. We used our hands to climb the\nslope and nothing much eventful happened before we took shelter in a stone\nshelter on top for lunch. There is no\nneed to describe the views; they were\nthe same as the previous two days. We\nspent a good few hours in Pete\u2019s Eats\nbefore boarding the minibus for the return journey. It was good to see the ice\ncream shop open in December. Only\nWales.\nAll in all, the winter tour was a great\nsuccess. The company, the food and\nthe luxury mountain hut made up for\nthe grim weather. Even though there\nwere hardly any views for the three\ndays we walked and we were constantly buffeted by gales, rain and cloud, I\nthink everyone secretly enjoyed the\nweather. There were a few other people\non the hills that weekend, but certainly\nno other groups of 19! All those 19 certainly showed that we love the hills for\ntheir own sake. You could almost say\n\u2018we choose to go to Wales in December\nand do the other thing, not because it\nis easy, but because it is hard\u2019.\nWalking with their heads in a cloud\nFellwanderers made their way to Snowdonia for a winter tour Alex Kendall tells felix about their adventures\nYou would think this lot might have learned by now that walking in Wales in the winter is likely leave them very cold and wet.\n\n"

    "content": "arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts\n16 felix Friday 30 January 2009\nEmily Wilson gets a few graphic lessons in anatomy and medicine over at the Royal College of Surgeons\nW\nho likes medical oddities? I do!\nI\u2019m a big fan of\ndead things in jars,\nand there are jars\naplenty in the Hunterian Museum at\nthe Royal College of Surgeons. This\nwas my second visit, and I\u2019ve come to\nregard it as one of the best museums in\nLondon. The galleries are sleek, shiny\nand modernised. Every item is clearly\nlabeled and explained, which is impressive given that the sheer quantity\nof STUFF here is astounding. It\u2019s much\nbigger than you would expect from a\nlittle-known, tucked away gallery. It\u2019s\nall free to get into and rarely gets busy.\nThis museum makes for a very relaxing\nSaturday afternoon excursion, assuming you\u2019re not too squeamish to handle\nit.\nFor any medical history buffs out\nthere, the museum holds mostly material gathered by the distinguished\nsurgeon and anatomist John Hunter\n(1728-1793). He spent much of his\ntime collecting animal specimens and\narranging them into a teaching mu-seum. His museum contained nearly\n14,000 specimens of over 500 different species of plants and animals. The\ngovernment purchased his collection\nin 1799 and it is now owned by the\nRoyal College of Surgeons, with the\nmuseum opening in 1813. A little nugget of trivia for you: Hunter died after\nsuffering a fit during an argument at St\nGeorge\u2019s hospital over the acceptance\nof students for training. The material\non display now makes up only about a\nquarter of Hunter\u2019s original collection.\nHe sold a lot of his minerals, paint-ings, prints and books himself in 1794\n(he needed the money, and apparently\nhe preferred his bits of animal). Some\nspecimens were disposed of since his\ndeath due to poor condition, and a lot\nof skeletons and fossils were lost during\nbombings in 1941. If you\u2019re interested,\nthe museum is crammed full of information about Hunter\u2019s life and work.\nSo... to the body parts in jars. You\nname it, they\u2019ve pickled it. Every ani-mal, every body part, every disease,\nevery weird and wonderful mutation is\ncovered. Just to name a few, you can see\n\u201cpart of a lion\u2019s oesophagus\u201d, \u201cthe trunk\nof a young crocodile dissected to show\nthe viscera\u201d and \u201cintestinal worms attached to portions of whale intestine\u201d.\nThere are whole sea cucumbers, spi-ders, wasps, termites, sea anemones,\nsea slugs cuttlefish, centipedes, various\nbeetles... Then there\u2019s half a dodo skeleton plus some skeletons of similarly\nextinct flightless birds such as moa and\nsolitaires. There\u2019s also some evidence\nof gruesome animal experimentation,\nsuch as \u201csections of cockerels\u2019 heads\nwith transplanted human teeth embedded in the combs\u201d.\nVisitors will be delighted by the\nveritable freak show of mutations and\ndefects on display. \u201cSkull of a 25 year\nold man showing enlargement due to\nhydrocephalus\u201d is impressive. It looks\nlike the skull of one of the aliens out\nof \u2018Mars Attacks!\u2019. Next to it is \u201cmodel\nof Chinese patient with parasitic twin\u201d,\nwho looks unsurprisingly gloomy. The\nskeleton of Charles Byrne (1761-1783),\nthe Irish Giant, is an awesome 2.31 metres tall (7\u2019 7\u201d). This chap suffered from\npituitary gigantism. Despite requesting that he be buried at sea, his body\nwas bought by John Hunter for \u00a3130\n(cheeky!). Then there are paintings of\nmidgets, siamese twins and a man who\nweighed 52 stone.\nThe impressive range of foetuses\nincludes guinea pig, porcupine, aard-vark, anteater and armadillo. There is\nin addition to the huge selection of human foetuses in jars, all different ages.\nTheir eyes are clenched in a grimace\nand their little mouths are gasping\nopen. Generally things are arranged\naccording to what bit of anatomy we\u2019re\nlooking at. \u201cMammary organs\u201d is a\ngood section.

A lot of the contents of these\njars are so warped and diseased they\nare completely unrecognisable. And\nit\u2019s not all things that used to be alive.\nThere is an extensive range of surgical\napparatus and medical instruments,\noften highlighting how surgery has\nprogressed over time. Some of the instruments are enough to make even\nthe hardened among us wince.\nThe end of my journey around the\nmuseum addresses the living patient\nand modern surgery, which is a contrast to most of the museum but still\nutterly fascinating. There is up to date\nmaterial on microsurgery, minimal\naccess surgery, transplants, cancer\nsurgery and stem cells. There are also\nsome videos of surgery. I watch a solid\n10 minutes of \u201cremoval of large benign\nbrain tumour\u201d. I have to look away\nfrom the screen quite often, particularly when the scalp is getting peeled\naway from the skull. The drilling into\nthe skull makes me shudder.

The ear transmits sound\nwaves into the cochlea, a spiral-shaped\norgan filled with fluid. The cochlea\ncontains two types of hair cells. While\nthe inner hair cells respond to vibrations in the fluid, converting them into\nneural signals, outer hair cells amplify\nthe vibrations.\nScientists have known for some time\nthat stimulation of the outer hair cells\nby feedback pathways emanating from\nthe brain dampens the amplification.\nHowever, the function that this serves\nhas remained uncertain. Scientists at\nJohns Hopkins University in the US\ninvestigated the role of the system by\ncreating genetically-modified mice.\nDr Paul Fuchs and his team introduced a \u2018gain-of-function\u2019 mutation\nin a gene that encodes a receptor\nprotein called nAChR.

They\ndo that by averaging the previously\nlearnt views, according to lead author\nAdrian Dyer of Monash University in\nAustralia.\n\u201cThe relationships between different components of the object often\ndramatically change when viewed\nfrom different angles,\u201d Dyer said. \u201cIt is\namazing to find the bees\u2019 brains have\nevolved clever mechanisms for problem solving which may help develop\nimproved models for AI face recognition systems.\u201d\n\u201cMost current AI recognition systems perform poorly at reliably recognising faces from different viewpoints,\u201d\nhe added.\nThe brain of the bee with its 1 million neurons is only 0.01 per cent of\nthe human brain but previous studies\nby Dr Dyer and his colleagues suggest that bees accomplish relatively\nsophisticated visual tasks. \u201cThe bee\nWeak electrical stimulation to the\nbrain allows people to learn complex\nmovements faster and remember them\nfor longer, a team of scientists from the\nUS National Institutes of Health have\nrevealed today.\nWriting in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they hope\nthat their technique will dramatically\nimprove recuperation from traumatic\nbrain injuries that can cause sufferers\nto lose basic motor skills.\nThe researchers, led by Dr Leonardo Cohen of the National Institute of\nNeurological Disorders and Strokes,\nhave found that by stimulating a region\nof the brain known as the primary motor cortex, the region that controls our\nmovements, whilst someone practises\na new skill can significantly decrease\nthe amount of time it takes them to\nlearn and remember it.\nMotor skills, like walking and talking,\noften require years to learn so that we\ndo not have to think about them. But\npeople who have suffered brain trauma can lose these skills, and it is only\nthrough lengthy and often humiliating\ntraining that they can be relearned.\nDr Cohen hopes that his painless and\nnoninvasive technique, called tDCS,\nwhich uses weak current to excite\ncells near the surface of the brain, will\nIncreasing demand for electric vehicles\nand portable electronic devices is driving a parallel need for environmentally\nfriendly batteries. But combining improved performance with safe, eco-ef-ficient operations is a tall order. Michel\nArmand of the Universite de Picardie\nJules Verne, France, and his team,\nshowed that a sustainably sourced organic version of the ubiquitous lithi-um-ion battery could provide the answer (Nature Materials, DOI:10.1038/\nNMAT2372).\nArmand\u2019s battery, built around a novel lithium-hydrocarbon anode, delivers\nup to three times the typical minimum\nenergy capacity needed for practical\napplications; but is environmentally-friendly too. The organic acids used to\nmake the electrode are readily synthesised on a sustainable basis from abundant recycled plastics. They also appear as a metabolic by-product when\nbio-organisms act on common hydrocarbons like benzene.\nThe team say their device generates\nless heat and is more thermally stable,\ncompared with conventional Li-ion\nbatteries with titanium or pure carbon\nelectrodes. That makes it an attractive\noption for hybrid vehicles, where the\npresence of petroleum fuels alongside\nelectricity makes battery meltdown\nunthinkable.\nWe glimpsed the consequences of\nthermal instability in 2006, when a\nmanufacturing defect in Sony laptop\nbatteries caused some devices to burst\ninto flames.\nLithium-ion batteries must show no\nmemory effect, so they retain their ca-Electric shocks to the brain\nlead to faster learning\nScientists predict foetal death rates\ncould be reduced if domestic violence\nis nipped in the bud. A team of scientists from the USA and Cameroon\nhave found further evidence of a link\nbetween domestic abuse and adverse\npregnancy outcomes. Victims of abuse\nwere found to be 50 per cent more\nlikely to suffer foetal loss. These women were also at higher risk of repeated\nincidents of foetal death, particularly\nwhen subject to emotional abuse.\nUsing a statistical approach, the team\nestimated foetal death rates could be\nreduced by around a third with swift\nand effective intervention. This effect\nis predicted to be strongest in victims\nof sexual abuse, where almost half of\nfoetal loss is preventable.\nThe study, published this week in\nThe Lancet, analysed data from the\nCameroon Demographic Health Survey, 2004. Women of varying ages and\neducational backgrounds from across\nthe country were interviewed under\nstrictly private and anonymous condi-tions. Victims of abuse were asked to\nidentify the actions of their spouses as\nemotional, sexual or physical violence.\nFrom the 2,562 women surveyed,\nover half were victims of abuse. Physical violence was identified as the most\ncommon form, affecting 39 per cent\nof the women. Such abuse was more\nlikely to be inflicted upon older and\nbetter educated women and accounts\nwere more prevalent among wealthier\ngroups.\nEmotional violence, such as public\nhumiliation and verbal threatening,\nwas found to have the strongest negative impact on foetal survival. Worryingly, such practice is often regarded as\nan integral part of traditional culture in\nsome African communities.\nThe scientists warn of \u201cthe erroneous\nidea\u2026[of] underestimat[ing] the invisible scars of emotional and psychological abuse on human beings, women in\nparticular\u201d.\nwas designed to cause the receptor to\nrespond more strongly to the release\nof transmitter molecules from the\nfeedback pathway.

The force of\ngravity caused the minuscule particles\nof dust to come together, eventually\nforming pebble-sized objects that in\nturn grew larger and larger in order to\ncreate the planets.\nThe theory is not without its prob-lems, however. Scientists normally assume the initial dust disk was the same\nthickness throughout, but crunching\nthe numbers in a computer simulation\nshows that this would result in planets of similar size with circular orbits.\nIn fact Mars and Mercury are much\nsmaller than Venus and Earth, and orbit the Sun in an ellipse. This discrepancy is normally explained away by the\npresence of Jupiter, the largest planet\nin the solar system, which exerts a\nheavy gravitational force. Hansen believes he has a different answer.\nIn his model, the dust disk is not\nuniform; rather it is clumped at different distances from the Sun. He suggests that Earth and Venus formed in\na particularly large clump, known as\nresearchers to conclude that the feedback system normally functions to\nprotect our ears from noise-induced\ndamage.\n\u201cWe think this pathway could be a\ntherapeutic target for protecting from\nsound damage,\u201d says Fuchs. \u201cThere is\na real chance of finding ear-specific\ndrugs in the future.\u201d Until then, he suggests that clubbers and concert-goers\nwould be prudent to wear earplugs.\nbrain is actually very good at learning to master complex tasks,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat may point to efficient processing\nalgorithms.\u201d\n\u201cComputer and imaging technology programmers who are working\non solving complex visual recognition\ntasks using minimal hardware resources will find this research useful,\u201d Dr\nDyer said.\nThe researchers used sugar rewards\nto train bees to focus on one certain\nface from either one perspective or\nfrom two different angles (0\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 or\n0\u00b0 and 30\u00b0), then presented them to a\nnovel angle (30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 respectively).\nOnly the group of bees, whose novel\nangle (30\u00b0) was between the original\nangles (0\u00b0 and 60\u00b0), were able recognise\nthe face, indicating that they averaged\nthe previously learnt views.\nBees model for AI\nvision?\nan \u201cannulus\u201d, capturing much of the\nproto-planet debris as they immerged\nfrom the dust.\nNot all of the material is captured\nand some particles can be ejected into\na different orbit. It is these ejected particles that would go on to form Mars\nand Mercury \u2013 Hansen estimates that\nonly 10% of the initial material would\nmake up these two planets, with the\nmajority gobbled up by Earth and\nVenus.\nClimate models\nfail to predict\nearlier seasons\nResearchers at Harvard University and\nthe University of California have discovered that over 60 different climate\nmodels used by the IPCC have failed to\npredict hotter and earlier seasons between 1850 and 2007.\nAnalysing global temperature measurements compiled by colleagues\nat the Climate Research Unit at the\nUniversity of East Anglia, the scientists discovered that winter temperatures have increased more rapidly\nthan summer temperatures. Winter\ntemperatures have risen by about 1.8\ndegrees Celsius \u2013 almost double the\nsummer rise.\n\u201cIt indicates the models are missing\nsome important process\u201d said Professor Peter Huybers, assistant professor\nof earth and planetary sciences at Harvard. \u201cThere could still be surprises\u201d\nHuybers and his colleagues also discovered that the seasons are on average coming 1.7 days earlier over land\nthan 50 years ago.\nBiologists, who have noticed sooner\nbird migration and the earlier arrival\nof spring buds, have also observed\nchanges in the seasons. Snow has\nbeen melting and sea-ice breaking up\nearlier and these observations have all\nbeen explained by how fast the Earth\nis warming up.\nHowever, scientists now know that\nthis is all as a result of earlier seasons\nas well as individual months warming\nat different rates.\nThe researchers, who published\ntheir work in the journal Nature, have\nexamined possible mechanisms for\nthe moving seasons. However, currently they have managed to only explain part of the mechanism thought\nto be responsible.

First things first,\nhow has your season been?\nReally good thanks. We have lots of\nfreshers in this year so had a bit of shaky\nstart but we are now doing well in both\nthe leagues and cups. We are the only\nhockey team left in BUCS cup.\nAny star players within the team?\nWell, I could be diplomatic and say\nmy whole team. However my current\ngoalkeeper is great - she is the fifth one\nwe have had this season!\nWhy so many goalies?\nMainly due to injury, but also due to\nthe fact that some of the freshers have\nfound it difficult to fit in the hockey\nwith the social and work life of IC.\nDo you find fitting in hockey a\nproblem?\nNo - I simply work harder than most\nother people I think. I use the weekends to get my work done. The good\nthing about hockey is that it is weekly\nand scheduled so you know what time\nyou need to take out.\nClearly in some sports there is a\nbig difference between the Medical and IC teams, why do you\nthink hockey is dominated by IC?\nI think the difference is that IC is a\nmixed club and we train hard and play\nhard. Although this year the medics\nare a much better team than in previous years which will make Varsity far\nmore exciting (although I hope our\nkeeper does not get sent off this year!)\nWho are you guys playing today?\nMedics! What was the score last\ntime you played them?\n3-1 victory in extra time. It was a very\nfrustrating game and we hope to beat\nthem by the usual margin at Varsity.\nI understand that you have a lot\nof fixtures to play this half of the\nseason - how are you coping with\nthat?\nWell, the Wednesday\u2019s are not really\na problem but if we keep succeeding\nin cup games then Sundays will start\nfilling up. Sundays are always an issue\nwith getting a team together and making sure the energy levels are up!\nWhat stages are you at in the cups?\nIn the BUCS cup we are in the 4th\nround and in ULU cup we are through\nto the quarter-finals.\nMoving on from the state of play,\nhow is the social side of ICHC?\nGreat fun - especially this year with\nlots of freshers who have lots of time\nand boundless energy!\nAny funny stories you want\nto share?\nSoho Slag has a tendency to end up in Soho\nwith a certain Men\u2019s\n3rd XI player!\nMoving on\nfrom the\nhockey club,\nwhat do you\nthink of the state of sport at\nImperial?\nIn general it is OK. Obviously it is\nnot a priority for Imperial students\nunlike some other universities, but I\nthink ICHC do very well, considering\nthe small numbers available.\nWhat about the rugby - who will\nwin the J.P\n.R. Williams Cup?\nI would love to say IC, but on current form and past history the medics\nwill probably do it again. I hope I am\nwrong!\nSo what are your ambitions in\nhockey and life?\nI want to play hockey for the rest of\nmy life. It is a sport that you can play\nuntil old age! In life I am one of the few\npeople on an Engineering course that\nactually wants to stay in engineering!\nWhy do you think there is such a\ngap in standard between the\nladies 1st and 2nds?\nI think it is simply a fact\nthat there are not enough\nwomen at Imperial who\nwant to play. Izzy (la-dies 2nd XI captain) has\nworked really hard to push\nthe team forward and try\nand bring the teams closer,\nbut at the same time I think it\nis good that there is a social\naspect to the hockey. Not a\nlot of people really want to\nput in the time, but would\njust rather play hockey because they enjoy it, and I\nthink that is a good thing.\nDo you think that there\nis a problem in terms of\ndepth of strength in the\nwomen\u2019s teams.\nIt is very frustrating for\nthe players that could come\nup, such as Izzy and Bella,\nwho are both good strong\nplayers, but there is simply not enough space on\nthe women\u2019s first team to\nbring them along. At\nthe same time, there\nis not enough player\ndevelopmentgoing\non to improve the\nstandard in the\nlower teams.\nIs there\nnothing that\ncan be done\nto improve this\nproblem?\nMore pitch space would\nbe great! It would mean we\nwould have more space for\ntraining since at the moment we\nhave six teams all training on one\npitch. Also having coaches would be\ngreat, at the moment we only have the\none coach and he spends his time with\nthe men\u2019s firsts.\nIt was mentioned in last weeks\nissue that Sport Imperial have\nbought new land in Ealing due to\nThis week Jack Cornish meets up with his female counterpart\nSarah Clayton, the ladies 1st XI captain who has successfully\nled a young team to some phenomenal results!\nthe expansion of Heathrow. Do\nyou think that they should perhaps build more hockey pitches?\nWe have so many players in the club,\nsimilar to that of the football club\nand rugby club, yet we only have one\npitch to play and train on. If we only\nhad a handful of hockey players then\nit would make sense to only have one\npitch, but we don\u2019t. So if we could have\nmore pitches at the new grounds that\nwould be great!\nIn my comment last week I was\nsaying that the rest of the season\nis now predictable for a lot of the\nteams. Do you think the same can\nbe said for yours?\nI think our season is a bit different to\na lot of the clubs since we did have a\nmassive influx of freshers this season.\nIt meant that at the start of the season,\nthe team was new and not used to playing with each other, but now\nwe have grown\nas a team. I\nthink some\nof those\ngames that\nwe narrowly\nlost at\nthe\nstart\nwill be different this time\naround.\nWas a shock losing\nso many players\nfrom last season\nthen?\nAt the start of the season we\nstarted off with only six players from\nAsk the captain -Sarah Rose Clayton\nlast year, but I think we have definitely\nimproved.\nWould you agree with the comment I made last week where I\ncriticised paying \u00a310 to watch the\nmain event at Varsity?\nI don\u2019t think a lot of people go along\nto watch it really. Personally I enjoy\nVarsity as en event because I play in it,\nbut I don\u2019t see why quite a lot of people\ngo to watch all the sports. I go to the\nrugby match because it is the start to\nrest of my evening before we all go back\nto the bar to either commiserate or\ncelebrate depending on the outcome.\nBut I do find it quite odd that people\ngo along to watch the rugby match\nbecause it is a clear cut result and\nit is only university level rugby,\nI mean I can pay \u00a35 to watch\nSaracens play and the level is\nmuch better. Considering\nyou do get transport as well,\nI guess it\u2019s not that bad.\nDo you think more\nof an effort should\nbe made to create\na spectacle of the\nother sports.\nI think it would be\ndifficult to do since\neveryone plays in different locations. For\nhockey I know\nwe do get\nquiteacrowd\nwatching\nthe games,\nmainly\nbecause\nplayers\nfrom\nboth\nclubs\nare\nSarah has been faced with a difficult challenge this year\n- having lost a number of key players at the end of last\nseason she has brought in freshers and senior players\nalike to out together a successful squad.

I don\u2019t know what it would\nbe like for netball since they don\u2019t have\nany viewing areas in Ethos, but it would\nbe difficult in general since everyone is\nall over the place.\nAny sporting idols or people you\ngenerally aspire to?\nMark Foster is fit! You can definitely\nput that in. But in general no because I\ndon\u2019t want to be a sports player, that\u2019s\nnot my aim.\nFocusing on women\u2019s hockey\nand women\u2019s sport in general,\nthere is a clear lack of publicity\nfor it. Even in the sports that are\npublicised and televised, such as\nfootball and rugby, the female\nequivalent is almost nonexist-ent. Seeing as hockey itself only\nseems to be in the spotlight come\nthe Olympics, would you say it is\neven worse for women\u2019s hockey?\nYou\u2019re right, there is clearly a lack of\nknowledge, especially for female hock-ey, but I think there are people who are\nmore interested in it than me. For example Vicki, who is my vice-captain, is\nArgentinian and it is a huge sport over\nthere, so she could probably name all\nthe players and all the teams out there,\nand she regularly watches the matches\nover the internet.\nI think it really is more of a cultural\nthing. Not many schools play hockey,\nnot many people play it in general\nfrom a young age therefore they don\u2019t\nknow anything about it. The fact that\nthe sport isn\u2019t really shown in the UK\nwould also make matters worse.\nFinally, anything you want to say?\nLadies please come and play hockey,\nwe are lots of fun. Oh and see you in\nthe union next week for the ACC bar\nnight. The theme is quite good as we\u2019ve\ngot quite a few teams involved in a Rubik\u2019s Cube type theme.

Whilst you were wallowing in\nthe apr\u00e8s-Christmas spirit, tugging\nat straining waistlines, stuffed with a\nmixture of turkey and chocolate, a few\nnoble ICSM Badminton individuals\ndusted off their badminton racquets,\npicked up their passports and headed\nto the University of Twente, Holland\nwith two hundred and fifty other students from across Europe for the International Student Badminton Tournament of 2008!\nAfter the flight to Holland, it was\nonly a short three-hour train ride to\nour final destination, Enschede. Upon\narrival we were shown to our sleeping\nquarters; to describe them as luxurious havens of somnolence would be a\nlie. It was a sports hall, which boasted\namongst other luxuries, a gigantic and\nvery cold floor. Luckily for some, alcohol was available from the start and so\nby the time it was a reasonable hour to\nclimb blissfully into a warm sleeping\nbag, a floor and towel seemed like an\ninterchangeable alternative.\nIn the hectic modern world in which\nwe live, a lot can be said for a nice lie-in. This attitude was however beaten\ninto a bruised and bloody submission\nby a business-like wake-up call at 8am\nthe next day.\nBreakfast then made its inaugural ap-pearance. The classic Jam-Ham breakfast is an oft-overlooked treat that not\nmany individuals have the pleasure of\nexperiencing in this country. For us,\nhowever, a jam and ham combined\ncombination was the pot of gold at\nthe end of the breakfast rainbow\u2026and\nwith this solid culinary foundation for\nthe day, we were ready to hit shuttlecocks at some Europeans.\nCompeting in Regional High, Low\nand recreational singles, men\u2019s, women\u2019s and mixed doubles we shuffled off\nto our games with destiny (nice girl,\nglossy hair). The tactics employed by\nthe Imperial Medics players were as\ncunning as they were sexy. For many,\na combination of power and accuracy\nproved the winning formula, for others\ngentle and dignified submission proved\nto be the more popular option.\nWithareassuringJamandHamlunch\nto power us through the matches, we\nfinished the day (and each of the three\ndays) exhausted but happy watching\nan amazing nationally ranked German\nwoman destroy the best national male\ncompetitors on the show court. We\nclapped; she grunted.\nNew Year\u2019s was the highlight of\nthe trip. A superb superhero themed\nnight where The Crazy 88 and Super\nMario made a special appearance, we\ndanced away our stiff backs and aching\nshoulders and entered 2009 in style,\ndrinking on the rooftop of the Twente\nUnion Bar and watching magnificent\nfireworks with other students from\nEngland, Ireland, Italy, Germany and\nour host country.\nI won\u2019t go into details of the remainder of the festivities but all in all, on new\nyear\u2019s day, hungover and battleworn\nafter many a shuttlecock had been hit,\nbut refreshed by a ground temperature\nof -14 degrees, we reflected on a great\ntour, where hunger did not get in the\nway of us having a rip-roaring time.\nICSM Badminton tour Holland\nSpecial Recognition:\nRahim Kanji - For crawling into\nbed next to Theo at 4am and playing\nmatches again at 8.\nPriya Garg - Playing against some\ngiant women and changing several\nplayers names on the score sheets.\nSas Srinivisan - Playing, and winning wearing two trousers, coat, jumper and a scarf.\nVishnu Aggarwal - For sleeping with\nSas and playing without complaint.\nDaniel Wang - For winning his doubles at an unearthly hour and going\nback to bed musing \u2018was it worth it?\u2019 as\nhe ate peas and carrots from a jar.\nTheo Georgiou Delisle - For dressing as Super Mario on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\u2018Theo is on fire!\u2019.\nKatie Wong - For supplying the gin\nand vodka as well as some handy badminton hints for those of us competing\nin the regionals.\nThomas Ward - Competing with a\npartner who had a twitch of flicking his\nleg up as he hit the shuttle.\nRishi Patel aka Squishy - Took on\n\u2018Thomaaas Ward\u2019 for some ICSM Badminton vs ICSM Badminton grudge\nmatching.\nSandra Sadoo - One of the many\nnames the intercom found hard to say.\n\u2018Sado\u2019 managed to hit her way to second place in the recreational mixed\ndoubles.\nDa Way Wang - Won the recreational players category and displayed some\nsolar system themed-pyjama wear.\nPram Chinduluri - Won the recreational players category and for being\nsurprisingly chirpy with an average of\n15 hours kip during the trip.\nNaveen Setty aka Zelda - Won the\nrecreational players category and for\nan extraordinary smashing leap captured in a photo.\nJoy Palit - For her crazy dancing,\nmaking the team survive the 5am New\nYear\u2019s call and thinking that a shuttlecock was called a \u2018cuttleshock\u2019 until the\ntournament started.\nP\nhoto\nby\nD\navid\nM\nurray\nICSMBC sprint to victory\nICSMBC dominated the UH Winter\nRegatta on Sunday 25th January as\nthey sprinted their way to winning a\nphenomenal amount of medals. An\nimpressive five finals and three victories were achieved due to the sheer\ndetermination and solid team-work of\nthe crews.\nThe preparation and excitement began on Saturday night for the novice\ncrews who \u2018carbo-loaded\u2019 in Southside\nhalls.\nAll members devoured copious\namounts of pasta, sweets, cake, and\npopcorn. After the inspirational talks\nand encouragement were delivered,\nthe novices crawled into bed to be\nready for the next day.\nThe Women\u2019s 2nd VIII (a crew containing two new members, one a nov-ice) had never rowed together before\nand therefore set out early Sunday\nmorning with their spirits high, happily battling the heavy rain, freezing\ncold and forceful wind with a purpose;\nto train to win.\nAs the weather cheered the Gunnersbury UL Boathouse filled with anxious\nbut enthusiastic ICSM supporters,\nshouting encouragement far louder\nthan any of the other supporters.\nAn interesting start was made by the\nWomen\u2019s 2nd VIII who raced GKT.\nDue to no fault of our crew, the boats\ncame so close together the launch\ncommanded the race to stop and it\nwas decided that the rest of the race\nshould be finished from that position.\nThe girls refused to be distracted and\nso ploughed on and won all their races\nthereafter.\nSome absolutely beautiful rowing\nwas observed from the Girls Novice 1st\nVIII who won all their races convinc-ingly.Thefantasticrowingtechniqueof\nEmma Stimson the girls is a result of the dedication of\nthe entire crew, described well by Captain Ola Markiewicz: \u201cRaces are not\nwon on the day, but by all the training,\nhard work and effort before-hand.\u201d Of\ncourse the commitment, perseverance\nand devotion of the captains, coaches\nand coxes contributed enormously to\neach crew\u2019s success.\nThe Boys Novice 1st VIII gave a\nstrong, confident performance and\nwere placed as the best UH crew.\nHaving raced the previous day in the\nQuintin Head, (without a cox box!)\nthe Senior Women\u2019s 1st VIII managed\nto beat St George\u2019s men but unfortunately weren\u2019t able to beat RUMS in\nthe final. However, the Senior Men\u2019s\n1st VIII were successful in flattening\nall competition, thoroughly deserving\nthe medals that they won.\nTeam effort was vital on Sunday and\nall of the ICSM coxes were vigilant,\npassionate and enthusiastic, to the extent that an attempt to converse with\nthem between races was met with:\n\u2018Must. Conserve. Voice.\u2019.\nCelebration followed the success in\ntrue medic-style with a pub crawl from\nGunnersbury to Hammersmith after\nthe presentation of medals. A thrilling\nday for all involved, ICSMBC has truly\nraised its game and shows great promise of further medals in the future!\nRugby 1sts win first match\nto tap and punt the ball cross field\nand off the pitch; a move that earned\nhim Twat of the Match.\nThe half time score was 12-7 in Imperials favour, \u201cDon\u2019t change a thing\u201d\nwas captain James Pettit\u2019s half time\norder. At the beginning of the second\nhalf Oxford came out strong and their\nfly half sent IC back into their own\n22 with a good chase which made IC\nconcede a penalty. The three points\nconceded were a wake up call for IC. A\nloose ball kicked was on and chased by\nFlannan O\u2019mahony but he was just unable to collect it but Tom Carroll was\non hand to pick it up and beat 2 men to\ncross the line.

I had a\nchance meeting with one student there\nwhile I was back home in the West\nCountry.\nEarlier in the week I went to an\nevent held by the CU which gave or-dinary, rational people the chance to\ngrill a Christian. Admittedly this year\nit was a HUGE improvement over last\nyear, the panel for which was made\nup from immature, self-righteous and\nfrankly slightly crazy Christians. It set\nme thinking. Why can people get away\nwith anything when they claim motivation due to religion?\nNews flash for you: your views are\nnot special. Religious beliefs are no\nmore valid than other beliefs for which\nevidence is limited or beliefs which are\ncompletely subjective.\nThe religious always seem to get\naway with \u2013 sometimes literally \u2013 murder in the name of their God and people stand off and say nothing. Unless\nit\u2019s the Jews, you anti-Semitic jerks. Be\nwarned, I will claw you.\nIt seems both religious and racial\ncomments have fallen under the iron\ngrip of political correctness.\nIt is supposedly \u201cacceptable\u201d for a\ncashierinasupermarkettorefusetosell\nalcohol to customers due to their own\nreligious beliefs. Sainsbury\u2019s is there to\nbuy booze from and if you can\u2019t sell it\nthen GET ANOTHER JOB. If anyone\nelse refuses to do a part of their job for\nno good reason they would be fired.\nBut oh no, not if it\u2019s a religious\nreason.\nYou know these new atheism adverts\non buses? One bus driver in London\nrefused to drive a bus with such an advert due to his belief in God. Instead\nof allowing everyone to have their\nown views and accepting these, this\none person caused one hell of a hassle\nfor the bus company which was kind\nenough to give him the day off then re-timetable him to ensure he only drove\n\u201cGod-friendly\u201d busses.\nNormally I would not mind any inconveniencing of private companies as\npublic transport should really be re-nationalised. It just makes sense.\nHowever, at least have a good reason\nto do so, not because of some insane\ndelusion and the inability to accept\nanything contrary to it and holding\nyour own religious conviction above\neverything else. There are more important things in life. Again, this bus\ndriver would have been fired if religion\nhad not been mentioned. George Bush\nkilled many innocent Afghanis and\nIraqis because God told him to bomb\nthe hell out of those nations. Well that\nis ok then. Go ahead. Kill as many of\nthose dirty Arabs as you like.\nReligion has left conflict and death in\nits wake around the world. A force for\ngood? Seriously, get a grip on reality,\nand do it soon.\nIf there is one thing I cannot stand,\nit is the mixture between state and re-ligion. As I pointed out strongly last\nweek, America have it bad. Strangely\ndespite having an official state religion here in the UK, you do not get the\nJames Goldsack\nPolitics Editor\nCar production lines such as this could soon grind to a halt indefinitely\nJames Goldsack\nPolitics Editor\nsame feeling of theocracy as in the US,\nexcept in the House of Lords. But then\nanyone with enough cash can find an\nopening there these days.\nA recent news story involved the\nGeorgian Orthodox church. A TV\nshow entitled \u201cTop Ten Best Georgians\u201d included in its shortlist 18 saints,\n13 of which have so far made it into the\ntop 50. Upon reading that far I had\nassumed it was anti-religious people\ngetting annoyed with how many saints\nwere in the shortlist to begin with. On\nthe contrary, the head of the church,\nPatriarch Ilia II, has called for the programme to be banned as it is \u201cunjustified to make the public put them in\nrank order\u201d.\nThis is a joke in itself. Saints were\njust people who the church puts a title\non, they were still JUST PEOPLE.\nThe story gets worse still. Many\nGeorgians consider the church above\nthe law. Out of the two institutions,\nthe church and the state, which do the\ncitizens have a degree of control over?\nWhich has a fixed agenda? Which can\nadapt when necessary? Which should\nhave greater authority? If you did not\nanswer \u201cThe State\u201d to all of the above\nquestions, I do not think I would let\nyou look after my kids. Crazy people.\nA member of the House of Lords,\nLord Ahmed, voiced concern over\nthe broadcast of the film Fitna, which\nequates Muslims with terrorists. Instead of allowing a free debate to un-fold, he threatened the organiser. The\nconcerns of one man have overridden\nour right to free speech. No one is making a fuss about this as Lord Ahmed is\nMuslim.\nAhmed\u2019s fury over this \u201cextremist\u201d\nevent is ironic as he caused controversy in 2005 over hosting a book launch\nby anti-Semitic author Israel Shamir.\nI am not saying that Fitna is correct,\nor even that Islam is a violent religion.\nMy problem with this is hypocrisy and\nthe way this man and others like him\nare immune due to their delusional\nbeliefs.\nNo other belief would be granted\nthis much power. Certainly no other\ndelusion would. The power granted by\nthis belief is obviously not only used\nfor bad but often, and I do mean of-ten, it is. Think of the people who are\ndead due to religious conflict. The fact\nthat people are so self-righteous due\nto their religious belief leads to these\natrocities. Think of the corruption of\nthe early church. Think of how religion\nhas divided us and held us back from\nprogress. Judaism and its runt offspring Christianity and Islam all advocate violence in some way. This should\nnot be respected.\nI have no problem with the religious,\nonly with the religions, the institutions,\nthe hierarchy, the theology. Who am I\nto tell people what to think? But then\nwho is that priest to tell you?\nPolitics in many countries is guided\nby religion: the Middle East, US, Georgia etc. Even we have our laws and\nmorals founded in Christianity.\nEqually, political views should be on\nthe same level as those of the religious.\nYour fascist conservatism is no more\ncorrect than my caring socialism.\nBut I am right.\nReligion, get\nout of my face\nCar makers\u2019 warning\nTens of thousands of car workers could\nlose their jobs as the motor industry collapses unless the government\ngives more financial help to the failing\ncompanies.\nUnion leaders warned that help is\ndesperately needed, more than the \u00a32.3\nbillion loan guarantee package already\npromised.\nTony Woodley, joint leader of Unite,\nsaid immediate financial support was\nneeded to keep workers in jobs.

This is following a long and\ngrueling campaign arguing that that\nthe public\u2019s right to know what was\nsaid is more important than the bureaucratic rules stating that the discussions should be kept secret. According\nto current law, such information need\nnot be released until 30 years after the\nincident in question has occurred.\nThe decision that details of the sessions on 13 and 17 March should be\ndisclosed was upheld by the tribunal\nbut the request has been strongly opposed by ministers, who are arguing\nthat the Freedom of Information Act is\nnot intended to allow for the publication of this kind of information.\nWhether the invasion was allowed\nunder international law is a highly\ncontroversial issue and one that was\ndebated within these meetings. The\nattorney general at the time, Lord\nGoldsmith, issued legal advice saying\nthat according to international law the\nsituation was allowed, having previously warned of the questionable legitimacy of the war.\nThe government now has 28 days\nto appeal, meaning that it is not yet\nguaranteed that the minutes will be\nreleased. In addition, the tribunal declared that this would not set a precedent for the publication of all cabinet\nminutes and that these were exceptional circumstances encompassing\nlegal pitfalls and public unrest over\nthe issue. Previously, Richard Thomas,\nthe information commissioner, had\nordered the government publish the\nminutes provoking an appeal to the information tribunal.\nA decision as to whether to publish\nthe minutes will now have to be made\nby ministers: the alternatives are to\nappeal to the high court, or to issue a\nministerial veto banning publication.\nThe Freedom of Information act that\ncame into force in 2005 allowed the\ngovernment to veto the publication of\nsuch information, but this clause has\nnot been used thus far.\nThomas commented: \u201cI welcome the\ncareful consideration that the information tribunal has given to this important issue. I am pleased that the tribunal has upheld my decision that the\npublic interest in disclosing the official\ncabinet minutes in this particular case\noutweighs the public interest in withholding the information.\nDisclosing the minutes will allow the\npublic to more fully understand this\nparticular decision. I am also pleased\nthat the tribunal reached the same\nconclusion as I did in relation to the\npublication of the handwritten notes\nof the meetings.\u201d\nThe mood amongst the opposition is\nthat the government need to acquiesce\nto this particular demand with some\nwelcoming the tribunal\u2019s ruling commenting that it could be \u201ccritical\u201d to\nhow the decision to go to war is perceived by future generations.\nSuggestions that over-looking the\n30-year time limit risked damaging\nthe effective running of government\nhave been denied, arguing that the\nIraq war is a case characterised by its\nuniqueness and therefore should be\ntreated in an according manner. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Ed Davey welcomed the tribunal\u2019s\nruling, saying that \u201cmany people were\nstill angry about the Iraq war.\u201d adding\nthat \u201cthe people who took these deci-sions, which were incredibly contro-versial, should be held to account,\u201d He\nexpressed his disappointment with the\nLabour government pointing out that\nin his opinion \u201cthe Labour government\nhas put up a wall of secrecy, in the years\nsince 2003, and prevented the full facts\nfrom coming out.\u201d\nOn behalf of the Conservatives, William Hague mirrored the Liberal Democrats calling for a full inquiry into the\nwar stating that it would be one of the\nfirst actions of a conservative government should they gain power. However, he did make it clear that this was\na special case surrounded by exceptional circumstances; \u201cI don\u2019t think in\ngeneral that cabinet minutes should be\nreleased a few years after the decisions\nare made. Ministers need to be able to\nspeak to each other frankly and if this\nhappens regularly, cabinet minutes\nwill become much less revealing over\ntime.\u201d A more useful approach, Hague\nbelieves, is to have an inquiry with the\npower to peruse the secret documents,\nin an attempt to learn from the mistakes made.\nThe government will be subjected to\nthe close scrutiny of the media and the\npublic and will have to make a rapid\ndecision as to whether to comply with\nthe tribunal\u2019s demands, keenly aware\nof the consequences no matter which\noption they eventually decide on. It is\ncertain that a tense atmosphere will\nbe pervading the halls of 10 Downing\nStreet in the coming weeks.\nProtesters in Trafalgar Square London against the war in Iraq, a microcosm of the mood rippling through the country.\nAn American soldier standing guard in Iraq, a situation that is reproduced all over the country regardless of public unease over the situation.\n\n"

That this particular\ntrack doesn\u2019t end up unlistenable is a\ntestament to the band\u2019s way with melodies and the lovely production during a\ndramatic key change halfway through.\nThis, together with the understated ar-rangements, is what makes the band\nshine brightest in the gloomiest, most\nintimate moments. Starting with some\nmurmuring acoustic guitars, \u2018One\nDove\u2019 slowly unfurls with shuffling\npercussion and brass that sounds as\nbroken and wounded as Antony, while\nwailing flutes meet his anxiety and fear\nof a changing landscape in \u2018Another\nWorld\u2019.\nUnifying the record, of course, is\nAntony\u2019s take-it-or-leave-it vocals.\nFor the most part, he still sounds like\nhe\u2019s singing under a bright spotlight\nwhile sitting on a smokey stage next to\na grand piano (you know\u2026), adding a\nhuge amount of operatic theatricality\nto practically every song. On \u2018Dust and\nWater\u2019, he attempts Bj\u00f6rk-ish mum-blings quite successfully, but his overly\naggressive delivery on \u2018Aeon\u2019 sees him\nconfuse raw passion for mascara-strewn melodrama.\nThose already unconvinced by Antony & The Johnson\u2019s balladry will\nfind little in \u2018The Crying Light\u2019 that\nwill convert them, particularly if it\u2019s\nthe voice that drives them away in the\nfirst place. However, those willing to\nexplore a little deeper are likely to find\nthat the four year wait was more than\nworth their while.\n\u201cThat this\nparticular track\ndoesn\u2019t end up\nunlistenable is a\ntestament to the\nband\u2019s way with\nmelodies\u201d\ncome the band\u2019s signature since their\ndebut, while Antony\u2019s keening vocals\ndrape over a dark and sombre melody.\nA richly quiet track, it beautifully demonstrates Antony\u2019s careful poetry and\nwhen he sings \u201cI saw six eyes glistening in my womb/I felt you calling me\nin the gloom\u201d, his panache for mixing\nthe romantic with the disturbing. This\nAnthony wears his heart on his face. Because he\u2019s got no sleeves. It\u2019s a laugh a minute down here in the felix office.\nclaimed album Call To Mind, released\nin 2007.\nStylistically, Commix are different to\nother drum and bass producers, with\nplenty of tech housey influences as well\nas a bit of minimal electro. Their last al-bum, The Future Sound Of Cambridge\nVol. 3 (Hospital Records), a joint-re-lease with Logistics and Nu:Tone, was\na great example of how, in contrast to\na lot of other productions, a great d\u2019n\u2019b\ntrack doesn\u2019t have to be a ceaseless aural onslaught across your entire hearing range. Thankfully, this attitude has\nbeen directly applied to this album and\nthe end result is an unusually delicate\nand thoughtful mix \u2013 not just for d\u2019n\u2019b,\nbut also for electronic dance music in\ngeneral.\nThe whole mix flows effortlessly\nfrom one track into another, gently\nopening with the duo\u2019s own track \u2018Life\nWe Live\u2019. The moody synths of DatA\u2019s\nThe Causeway and Logistics\u2019 Murderation pave the way for the deep bassline\nand mysterious vocal samples of Commix\u2019s Justified.\nTouring through tracks from some of\nthe most innovative producers in d\u2019n\u2019b,\nsuch as Spectrasoul and Calibre, Commix build tension and then drop, in\nthe highlight of the record, their track\n\u2018Bear Music\u2019, with its heavy hitting and\ncavernous sub-bass. The album winds\nup perfectly with the smooth, downtempo \u2018Photograph\u2019 by Instra:mental.\nWith this mix, Commix are trying\nto rekindle the interest of people who\ngave up on drum \u2018n\u2019 bass a few years\nago. I think they will: Commix have\ncreated an outstanding mix that will\nnot only appeal to drum \u2018n\u2019 bass heads,\nbut to anyone who has interest in electronic music.\n\u201cIraq DnB - Commix 2005\u201d: No one turned up to the rave\nTo see Vivian Girls walk out onto the\nstage is to see a band who look exactly\nas you imagine they would before you\nsee them: lazily dishevelled, implacable\ncharity shop-esque clothes, smatterings of ironic tattoos (teacups, cassette\ntapes, milkshakes), unintentionally\ncool (well they did grow up in Brooklyn, New York). After several requests\nfor more feedback on the guitar, they\nlaunched into songs from their debut\nalbum (s/t), with simple guitar riffs and\nmonotonous vocals that reflect their\nimpassive lyrics.\nThey play music that is a cross between the American garage rock of\nthe early \u201890s and the indie britpop of\nbands like Sleeper and Talulah Gosh,\ndrawn out and fuzzed up like shoe-gaze. It\u2019s not a wholy original sound, so\nmany bands have the same influences,\nbut what Vivian Girls do is do it well.\nLive, they are faster, harsher. Their\nset is peppered with little bits of conversation as they try to engage with the\ncrowd. The venue was sold out (a rare\nthing at White Heat) though the crowd\nwas not a very enthusiastic one - at one\npoint Katy asked \u201cIsn\u2019t this supposed\nto be a party?\u201d and was answered by a\nfew muttered chuckles and some shuffling of feet.\nOverall however, I\u2019d say it was pretty\ngood, and if they release new material\nand tour in the future, there is a good\nchance I will see them again.\nAll American Rejects looking like a bunch of cunts\nin the US billboard top 100, telling us\none thing and one thing only - America\nis still a country of wankers, regardless of the fact that they were able to\nchoose the correct administration this\n\u201cThree minutes\nand thirty-three\nseconds of three\nchord mediocrity\u201d\n:LISTINGS::LISTINGS::LISTINGS::LISTINGS::\nFriday\nMonday\nTuesday\nNGS::LISTIN\nBass Clef :: The Fly :: Dubstep\nMax Tundra :: Cargo :: IDM\nBuzzcocks :: Shepherds Bush\nEmpire :: Punk\nShy Fx :: Fabric :: Drum and\nBass\nCulture Shock :: Herbal :: Drum\nand Bass\nAdam Beyer:: Ministry of Sound\n:: Techno\nLook See Proof :: Barfly :: Indie\nGreenStone :: The Troubadour\n:: Alternative Rock\nThe Rifles :: Banquet Records ::\nIndie\nU.S. Girls :: Old Blue Last :: DIY\nPop\nOrphans & Vandals :: Hoxton\nSquare Bar & Kitchen :: Indie\nAlex Roots :: Rough Trade East ::\nPunky Pop\nThe Aeroplanes :: 93 Feet East::\nIndie\nSoprano :: Dublin Castle :: Rap\nJudith Owen :: ICA :: Jazz\nGlissando + The Monroe Transfer\n:: The Macbeth :: Post Rock\nDelete :: Underworld :: Minimal\nJoe Brooks :: Barfly :: Acoustic\nThe Great Indoors + Empire of\nLight :: The Roebuck :: Indie\nSaturday\nTurbowolf :: 93 Fee East :: Hard\nRock\nPopular Workshop :: Buffalo Bar\n:: Indie\nSunday\nDenise :: Lyric Theatre :: Indie\nAeon :: Underworld :: Death\nMetal\nThe Display Team :: The\nMarlborough :: Acoustic Wednesday\nThe Dresden Dolls :: Electric\nBallroom :: Alternative / Indie /\nRock\nThe Airborne Toxic Event :: 100\nClub :: Indie Rock\nKelli Ali :: The Saughtered Lamb\n:: Dreampop\nFuture Islands :: Barden\u2019s Boudoir\n:: New Wave\nThursday\nJedi Mind Tricks + OuterSpace ::\nCoronet :: Rap\nThe Boy Least Likely To :: Soho\nRevenue Bar :: Indie\nFriendly Fires :: New Slang at\nMcluskys :: Indie\nInnerpartysystem :: The\nUnderworld :: Electronic\nFrida Hyvonen :: Bush Hall ::\nSweedish Indie\nCrystal Antlers :: Bloomsbury\nBowling Lanes :: Psychedelic\nLes Figurines :: The Enterprise ::\nIndie\nLa Roux + De Tropix :: Notting\nHilll Arts Club :: Rock\nDJ Scotch Egg + Others :: SE1 ::\n8-bit Nintendocore\nTransglobal Underground ::\nBardens Boudoir :: Electronica\nSeasick Steve :: Hammersmith\nApollo :: Homeless Blues\nStereo Total :: Bar Rumba ::\nElectron\nIn all honesty, I expected very little\nfrom this single, and unsurprisingly it\ndelivered exactly that.

Even\nlarge companies like Microsoft and\nIntel had announced that about 5,000\nof each of their employees would have\nto leave, although neither had reported\nany financial loss; ASUS and Samsung reported their first-ever quarter\nloss of about $100 million and $674\nmillion respectively but both had expressed that there would be no layoffs;\nthe worst sufferer of all was probably\nAMD, which reported a staggering\n$1.42 billion loss and has laid off 9% of\nits work force (1,100 jobs).\nSo how will this affect us? For start-ers, we may experience a technology slowdown which means fewer new\ngadgets coming out this year.\nHowever this may also mean more\neffort will be concentrated on the\nfewer products. For instance, Palm\nhad gone quiet for years until their announcement of the Pre smartphone at\nthe CES and many critics agreed that\nthe Pre will be the company\u2019s saviour.\nExpect to see it in stores in this half of\nthe year.\nWe are also expecting many other\ninteresting technologies and gadgets\nto emerge at some point this year. To\nname a few; USB 3.0, SDXC memory\ncards, Windows 7 (which I have been\nplaying with and frankly it\u2019s stolen\nmore features from Mac OS X), mind-controlled games (as mentioned in last\nweek\u2019s felix), more Android phones\nand more energy-efficient gadgets.\nApart from these, I can\u2019t really think of\nanything else. Do send me an e-mail if\nyou feel that I have missed out something very obvious.\nApart from the obvious ones above,\nhave you ever thought about what fictional technologies you would love to\nsee becoming reality? The other day I\nthought of a reader that could convert\nyour thoughts into a Powerpoint slideshow or Flash animation, thus saving\nyou from those lonely hours in front of\nthe computer screen.\nMy second idea was a \u201cdrinkable\nsleep\u201d: basically, if you\u2019ve been up all\nnight (which is what\u2019s happening to\nme these days) yet you don\u2019t have the\ntime to recover in the middle of the\nweek, you could drink a bottle of this\ngoodness that gives the same effect\nas one night\u2019s sleep. I would actually\npay good money for this stuff because\nlife\u2019s too short with those wasted hours\nat night. A lot of the times I wished I\ncould be watching Family Guy instead\nof sleeping.\nIf you have had similar creative im-aginations, please do send them in at\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nShit happens\nsometimes\nASUS vs. Pegatron\nThe Taiwanese requiem of Steve Jobs\u2019 fight against Apple?\nI\nf you have never heard of Pegatron, you should have at least\nheard of ASUS, the company\nbehind the successful Eee PC\nnetbook franchise. And why\nshould you find this article interesting?\nWell, the story shares a similar background with Apple\u2019s rise and fall: recall\nthe year 1985, when Apple stripped\nco-founder Steve Jobs of his managerial duties over a power-struggle with\nthe then-CEO John Sculley and so Jobs\nresigned. In the same year he founded\nNeXT Computer, which went head-to-head against Apple with their own\ncomputers and software. Interestingly,\nby the end of 1996 the failing Apple acquired NeXT and six months later Jobs\nreplaced Gil Amelio to become interim CEO (or more popularly known as\n\u201ciCEO\u201d). Today, Jobs is the permanent\nCEO of a healthy Apple Inc. which is\nworth $80 billion.\nSuch fascinating story is about to be\nreplicated on the Taiwanese soil. Steve\nJobs\u2019 counterpart is ASUS co-founder,\nTung Tsu Hsien, who is now the chairman of the one-year-old Pegatron. The\norigin of ASUS is quite interesting and\nnot often talked about, so allow me to\ntell you how it all started, which should\nhelp you understand the potential impact of Pegatron;\nThe year was 1989 and Taiwan had\njust finished celebrating Chinese New\nYear. Tung, along with Ted Hsu, Wayne\nHsieh and Liao Min Hsiung, were Senior Engineers at Acer and they all saw\ntheopportunitiesofferedbythebloom-ing market of Intel\u2019s 386 microprocessor and Microsoft Windows. The four\nmade final discussions over the public\nholiday and decided to resign, in order\nto start up their own motherboard development business. ASUS was thus\nborn on 2nd\nApril in the same year and\nrumour has it that such name (a truncated \u201cPegasus\u201d) was specifically chosen so that Acer still lists alphabetically\nabove ASUS \u2013 a noble homage to the\nfounders\u2019 ex-company.\nEven though opportunities seemed\nto be everywhere, the four bright engineers struggled to get attention for\ntheir young company, as hardly anyone saw the motherboard as a mon-eymaker. Eventually, ASUS decided to\nmanufacture their own motherboards\ninstead. This led to their first Intel 486\nprototype motherboard at the end of\n1989. Funnily enough, such development was made possible by Acer\u2019s cofounder and General Manager, Jonney\nShih, who provided generous funding.\nASUS then took their 486 board to\nIntel to try their 486 prototype processor on it (Intel Taiwan had the one and\nonly engineering sample for Asia back\nthen). While Tung and his team were\nwaiting in a corner, they overheard\nthat Intel\u2019s own prototype motherboard went kaput, so they volunteered\nto have a look and \u2013 to Intel\u2019s surprise\n\u2013 managed to fix it. It was this miracle that established the strong link between ASUS and Intel today.\nSo what has gone wrong with today\u2019s ASUS? Jonney Shih is partly to\nbe blamed. After Tung\u2019s many years\nof begging, Shih left Acer and became\nchairman of ASUS in 1994. It was just\nover a year ago when he decided to\nsplit company into three units: ASUS,\nPegatron and Unihan.\nSuch restructuring was meant to let\nASUS concentrate on the laptops and\nsystems, with Pegatron taking care of\nmotherboard and component manu-facturing, and Unihan handling sub-component and chassis production.\nMany thought that this was just a plot\nto reset all employee pensions (there is\nno Taiwanese law which states that all\ncompanies have to offer pension plans),\nbut it appears that there is a darker side\nof this story.\nAccording to Taiwanese magazine\nBusiness Today, during the split announcement meeting in 2007, Shih\nand Tung already showed signs of\ntheir icy relationship. The magazine\nclaimed that Tung was forced to accept the chairman role of Pegatron, a\ncomponents company when his real\npassion was in the establishment of the\nASUS brand. The reason for this oust-ing? So that Shih could let his brother-in-law, Jonathan Tsang, take up Tung\u2019s\nASUS vice-chairman role, thus leaving\nTung out of any executive decisions\nover ASUS. Even though Tsang had\nalso given financial aid to ASUS in\nthe early days, Tung had many rough\npatches with Tsang as President of\nMarketing. Apparently he went against\nthe wishes of several key staff over the\nlaptop business and ended up with a\nfew significant resignations; but there\nwas nothing Tung could do about the\nboard\u2019s decision of his own ousting.\nThankfully, Tung\u2019s renowned friend-ly, caring management-style influenced\na handful of loyal, talented ASUS staff\nto move to Pegatron. With some of\nthese people he formed PEGA Design,\nwhich will take in orders for designing laptops, desktops, modems etc. for\nany companies, starting in February.\nWith enough orders, Tung could then\nlet Pegatron do the manufacturing as\nwell so that they are not working just\nfor ASUS. After all, this was how ASUS\nstarted before they released laptops\nunder their own brand (for instance,\nthey still manufacture MacBooks as\nwell as doing R&D for Apple).\nWe look forward to the day when\nTung establishes his own brand again\nand hopefully overtakes ASUS, just like\nSteve Jobs did with NeXT and Apple.\nASUS co-founder Tung Tsu Hsien and ASUS chairman Jonney Shih\nOriginal image from Business Today\nWhich netbook?\nSince the launch of the Eee PC, other\ncompanies quicky followed ASUS\u2019\ntrend and released their own netbooks.\nWhilst most share similar specifica-tions, there are a couple of things that\nyou should watch out for:\nSeeing is believing: make sure\n1.\nyou check out the real thing in\nperson, paying special attention\nto the keyboard, touchpad, heat\ndissipation and LCD.\nBrand reputation: after-sale\n2.\nservice can vary from one country to another for any company,\nso use Google to check your\ndestination\u2019s feedback!\nWarranty: obviously, the longer\n3.\nAcer Aspire One A150 HP Mini-note 2133 Advent 4490 ASUS Eee PC 901 MSI Wind U100\nIntel Atom N270 1.6GHz VIA C7-M ULV - 1.2GHz Intel Atom N270 1.6GHz Intel Atom N270 1.6GHz Intel Atom N270 1.6GHz\n120GB HDD, 1GB RAM 120GB HDD, 1GB RAM 120GB HDD, 1GB RAM 20GB SSD, 1GB RAM 120GB HDD, 1GB RAM\nLinpus Linux SuSe Linux Windows XP Home Xandros Linux Windows XP Home\n802.11b/g 802.11b/g, Bluetooth 802.11b/g, Bluetooth 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth 802.11b/g, Bluetooth\n8.9\u201d LCD, 0.3MP webcam 8.9\u201d LCD, 0.3MP webcam 8.9\u201d LCD, 0.3MP webcam 8.9\u201d LCD, 1.3MP webcam 10\u201d LCD, 1.3MP webcam\n3x USB, 5-in-1 card reader 2x USB, SD card reader 3x USB, 4-in-1 card reader 3x USB, SD card reader 3x USB, 4-in-1 card reader\n3-hour battery, 1.26kg 2-hour battery, 1.2kg 2.5-hour battery, 1.12kg 6-hour battery, 1.1kg 2-hour battery, 1.0kg\n1-year UK-only warranty 1-year UK-only warranty 1-year UK-only warranty 2-year UK-only warranty 2-year UK-only warranty\n\u00a3189.00 (Amazon) \u00a3199.99 (Misco.co.uk) \u00a3229.99 (PC World) \u00a3261.74 (Amazon) \u00a3278.48 (Amazon)\nthe better, but sometimes you\u2019ll\nhave to pay a bit more (like the\nASUS and MSI).\nI consider the netbooks on the right\nto be the best value.

While at the\npresentation however, you forget you\neven mentioned food and scribble away\nany religious word the HR rep standing\n10 feet from you spews out.\nThe blasphemous use of food\nas an excuse to do something is a\ncowardly act that innervates me quite\nseverely. There is nothing wrong with\nwanting to go to a stupid cousin\u2019s\nwedding, becoming a banker or going\nto that nerdy Sci-Fi Society meeting or\nthat perhaps overly hacky ePortfolio\nreview. The food at these events is\nmore often than not, undeniably good\nand available in copious quantities.\nAs a foodie, this is something that is\nnigh on impossible to pass on. There\nis also the mini-food conundrum.\nIt\u2019s like a burger, only smaller and as\na result, irresistible. Or small cocktail\nsausages. Or even tiny little banoffee\npies. For some unbeknownst reason\nor other to anyone, as human beings\nwe are genetically predisposed to\nfall madly in love with miniatures\nof mundane things, and in the world\nof gastronomy this is not any different.\nOur insanity levels are driven through\nthe roof at the thought of a salmon and\ncream cheese finger sandwich the size\nof your thumbnail.

The owner\nSam, a wonderfully warm native\nof Kuala Lumpur, had immediately\nsettled my nerves with her talk of\nstaying true to that what she knows and\nloves, sourcing, wherever she could,\nauthentic ingredients and resolutely\nsteering clear of that all too familiar\nscourge of modern cuisine \u2013 \u201cfusion\u201d.\nHer commendable philosophy is\nreflected in a reassuringly concise and\nwallet friendly menu, the pick of the\nMelur HHHHK\n175A Edgware Road\nEat-in or take-away\n020 7706 8083\nBest: The grilled spicy mackerel\nWorst: Chicken and prawn noodles (yet, not that bad)\nPrice: Under \u00a320 per head\nstarters being the chicken Satay. A dish\nI have always viewed with suspicion,\nthis was a million miles away from the\ndepressing super market guff I have\npreviously been subjected too, with\njuicy chunks of marinated chicken,\nchar-grilled and served alongside a\nbowl of wonderfully unctuous, freshly-made peanut sauce with hints of\nlemongrass and chilli. The spring rolls\nweren\u2019t bad either.\nWith the mains ranging from an\napparently just-a-bit-too authentic\nfish-head curry (not one order\nreceived to date) to the more familiar\nnoodles and curries one might expect,\nthere is something here to suit just\nabout everyone. For the veggies,\nthe aubergines cooked in Sambal, a\ntraditional chili sauce, are definitely\nworth a crack whilst for those slightly\nredder in tooth and claw, an aromatic\nbowl of chicken curry would certainly\nsatisfy. The grilled spicy mackerel\nwas my particular highlight, with its\nwonderful smokey flavour countered\nbeautifully by the fish\u2019s oily character.\nOnly the chicken and prawn noodles\nleft me somewhat underwhelmed, but\neven this was far from bland.\nA starter followed by a main,\ntogether with a rice dish and the Roti\nCanai (traditionally made layered flat\nbread with a curry dip) would be more\nthan enough to silence even the most\ntenacious of appetites and probably\nstill see you get the best part of a fiver\u2019s\nchange back from a twenty. However, if\nyou are one of those always with room\nfor dessert, you could certainly do a\nlot worse than go for the somewhat\nunusual but warmly soothing option of\nsweet potato, yam and sago cooked in\ncoconut sauce.\nCasually appointed and, with most of\nthe other diner\u2019s conversations audibly\nacademic in nature, Melur is most\ndefinitely student friendly and, with\na fully licensed bar and the chance to\nwin free meals and musical tickets in\nFebruary and March, it is certainly\nworth a visit.\nApart from the odd slither of raw fish\nand a dash of wasabi, my culinary\nworldliness tends not to stretch much\nfurther east than the Bay of Bengal.\nNot that I haven\u2019t dipped my toe, so to\nspeak. I mean, I have even travelled as\nfar as Hong Kong, but if I recall cor-rectly, my gastronomic development\nwas at a somewhat nascent stage at the\ntime and I pretty much lived off fried\nchicken and cheeseburgers (I know, I\nknow).

Does smoking\nweed make you worse than a drunk driver?\nF\nun time. I\u2019m going to ask you\nto misbehave. All you have to\ndo is to select the behaviour\nthat is conceptually less likely to do harm to the others.\nHere are the choices: A. Drunk driving\nand B. Smoking marijuana.\nHave you picked a side? An overwhelming number of people I spoke\nto agree that drink-driving is the more\nsinister of the two. Side-effects of alco-hol? We can spell them back to front.\nThe tardiness in sensation. The faux-beautification of a minger you danced\nwith in the club. The egotistic text to\nyour ex-boyfriend saying how terrible\na person he has been. Translate it to\nthe drink driving experience? You can\u2019t\nreact quickly enough to the chicken\ncrossing the road. The traffic light\nbecomes a beautified mixture of red,\nyellow and green. An over-take seems\nmore doable than usual because you\nare Lewis Hamilton. The consequenc-es? You can have a KFC for breakfast.\nYou have created a chaos at the junction without sieving through your\nphysics textbook. Above all, you have\ncrashed your car.\nThe government is worried about\nSkunk. It is a strain of cannabis that is\ncultivated differently to the traditional\nvariations. Skunk has a significantly\nhigher THC level, which is the bad\nboy behind the inexplicable funniness\nof a milk bottle and the fondness to\nall things sweet. The government has\nalso drawn the public attention to the\n\u201cpossible\u201d link between marijuana and\nschizophrenics. Is this what they are\nworried about?\nWhat about the \u201cdefinite\u201d link between alcohol and cirrhosis/liver can-cer/raucous behaviour/aggressiveness/\nloss of memory/aging of skin? You are\ngoing to quote me wrong now, aren\u2019t\nyou. \u201cA glass of red wine a day helps\nreduce the chance of coronary heart\ndisease.\u201d OK, what then if you are a leisure cannabis user?\nWhat is the ratio of people admitted\ninto hospitals for brain damage caused\nby smoking marijuana to people getting treatment for alcohol related in-juries/diseases? Get into an A&E on\na Saturday night and see for yourself.\nFrankly, the government should show\nmore concern to the Camden popula-tion. How much do you think the government has spent on patrolling the\nstreets and sending off ambulances to\nrescue yet another blue whale stranded\nin a mixture of bile and undigested Kebab on the curb? \u00a33 is quite enough to\ncause failure in linear motions if you\ndon\u2019t care what type of alcohol fills\nyour bloodstream. To get stoned? \u00a33?\nThe Dutch. They are liberal, aren\u2019t\nthey? I don\u2019t recall bloody faces and\nmen dressed in puke as common sightings on the streets of Amsterdam.\nStoners are usually tourists, and their\nhands are too shaky to even fathom a\nfistful punch. But I hear Lonely Planet\nis about to open a new section called\n\u201cUrban Zoo \u2013 Guide to Drunken Birds\nin London.\u201d Logically speaking if there\nare any chemicals in need of restrict-ing, cannabis shouldn\u2019t even appear on\nthe priority list. Why is there no MP\ndebating the effects of chronic alcohol\ndrinking then? Oh wait, I have heard of\ntheir wine cellars\u2026\nI know you are all experts in reading\ngraphs. But allow me to patronise your\nclever brains by moving your finger to\nthe alcohol and the cannabis dot. What\ncan you see? Alcohol is more likely to\ncause harm and dependency than can-nabis. It is not just me arguing using\nmy brain muscles then. I have some\npharmacologists standing behind my\nback.\nDespite all my efforts arguing, I really am not giving you a pat on the\nback for smoking illegal drugs. My\nfinger, however, lingers on the discrepancy between law and reality. 1) Refer\nto your selection above, does it seem\nsocially less acceptable to drink-drive?\n2) What does the dependency-harm\ngraph tell us about alcohol and canna-bis? 3) Trace your finger on the graph.\nTobacco is eviler than cannabis. But\nall you people who are on par in terms\nof tar saturation with the late Einstein\nmay be relieved to find that tobacco is\nnowhere to be seen on the illegal drug\nclassification list.\nThe punishment system, however,\nacts in a slight contradictory manner\nto my arguments above. So what if I\ntell you now, that if you are caught in\npossession of marijuana, you can be\njailed for up to 5 years and face an unlimited fine? What if you drink-drive?\nYou are liable to a half year sentence\nand a \u00a35000 fine. Provided you didn\u2019t\nhit anything. It reminds me of my\ncaveman friend\u2019s house rules. Pulling\nlittle sister\u2019s ponytail equals grounding for the rest of one\u2019s puberty, minus\nall pocket money. Ironing little sister\u2019s\nface equals steak dinner being replaced\nby sausages. Are you rethinking your\nchoice of misbehaviour now, hum?\nWhile we scientists and engineers\nabide to the laws our wig-wearing\ncounterparts make; why is it that they\ncan so conveniently ignored the paper\nwe strive to publish? Have flamboyant\nsentence structures and unpronounceable Latin words come above facts and\nfigures?LinguisticallyCannabisismore\ndangerous than Ketamine. Therefore\nCannabis has been upgraded from a C\nto a B. Scientific finding doesn\u2019t appear\nto agree so.\nHas the wig-wearer tweaked the innocent scientist\u2019s nipple and go \u201cmix\nall the test tubes you want. It really\ndoesn\u2019t matter at the end of the day\u201d?\nWhy do we bother with an anomaly\nresult then? Let\u2019s just go \u201cCannabis is\nlikely to be therapeutic. Because, uh.\nYeah.\u201d\nOf course it is not the lawmaker\u2019s\nfault. People who spent 6 years in Law\nSchools are unlikely to have heard of\nWeb of Science. The problem with us,\nis that we are too preoccupied in our\nlab and too preoccupied to be cynical\nto translate pub-debates into the real\nworld. And this is not a question about\ncannabis and alcohol anymore. We are\neasily the most logical individuals on\nearth. Why are we letting people who\nmerely have bigger mouths and bigger\nhair dictate unreasonably what conditions we ought to live in without the\nprior consultation of scientific facts?\nYou may fold your hands and sit in\nfront of your computer to wait for the\ncitation number to go up. But isn\u2019t a\nconstructive way to convey to the generally scientific inept public the proposed truth of the universe. We can\ncontribute our knowledge constructively to socio-political issues. We can\nbegin here. This time and space. As\nstudents. We live in our own scientific\nand cynical world. Yes, we know what is\nhappening on the news. We care about\nGaza. We will put up a wall and have\nstudents scribble a few apologetic condolences on it. Yes, I am all for Obama\nbut wearing an \u201cI Heart Obama\u201d t-shirt\nwill jeopardise my hard-earned geeky\nstature.\nNo. People, we can take our drunken political debates out of the pub.\nIf people can\u2019t hear us on paper, let\nthem see us in real life. Let them hear\nour say. You want more freedom on\nyour stem cell research? Stop moaning about the lack of it amongst your\nbest mates in Biochemistry, who have\nexactly the same viewpoints as you do.\nIt is comforting to live in a box where\nyour arguments are nodded upon by\nyour friends. Not too much so when it\ncomes to persuading the law-makers\nto grant you more flexibility amid your\nbid to save the world.\nI understand the lawmakers toil away\nto balance everyone\u2019s opinion before\nsealing the envelope. And I am sure\nthere are many politically active scientists out there. But it certainly doesn\u2019t\nhurt to have a few more.\nGilead Amit feels proud of\nhis Exonian heritage\nI\nam very disappointed with my\nadoptive country. Which is not,\nI scramble backwards through\nbarbed wire and under heavy\nmachine gun fire to point out to\nyou, this one. That fact may come as\na surprise to you. It possibly may not.\nIt all depends on how easily surprised\nyou are and how excruciatingly little\nyou care. By way of justifying this revelation I feel bound to mention that I\nhave been mistaken for an Englishman\nin the past. In this last twelvemonth\nmy accent, affectations and appearance have so confused the general public that I have been taken for German,\nAustralian, South African and, during\none particularly memorable evening in\nthe company of a gentleman who was\nscraping the literal barrel as assiduously as the figurative one, for Welsh.\nOn a whim I decided to humour the\npoor soul by injecting a sparkling lilt\ninto my otherwise staccato tones and\npassed myself off as Huw. My imitation\nof a Mumbai taxi-driver was, I discovered later, the talk of the party.\nBut, despite the stuffiness and self-deprecation of my character, my partiality for triangular sandwiches and the\ngraphic and obscene acts of depravity I\nallow myself to inflict upon our common language, I am not a native of\nthis sceptred isle. This fortress, built\nby Nature for herself against infection,\nhas no place within her walls for the\nlikes of me. With my distaste for tea,\nmy unhealthy attitude towards cricket and my preponderance for cheap\nstereotypes picked up from continental travel guides of the prewar period,\nI am kept safely at arms length by the\nofficials at HM Border Agency.\nNo; I am not a part of what Napoleon\nwould doubtless have called this nation\nof jobseekers. I am Exonian. I was born\na Wylander, but the many happy years\nspent in Exonia have won me a small,\nbrightly coloured passport complete\nwith the decorations and official imprints characteristic of that glorious\ncountry. It is a treasured possession,\nwhose place in my heart is second only\nto the complementary ID card distributed to me at the same time. It is testament to my pride in my nationality\nthat my fingers invariably close around\nthis card whenever I mean to present\nmy college ID. Though my heart swells\nwith pride at the sight of it, the door to\nthe computing suite never ceases to be\nunimpressed. The arrangement of my\nwallet, however, is perhaps a question\nfor a happier hour.\nAs an Exonian national, whether living at home or abroad, there are certain obligations I am legally required\nto fulfill. It was therefore strongly recommended to me that I register with\nthe nearest consulate or embassy as\nquickly as possible upon a change of\naddress. I have been reachable in NW1\nas of September \u2013 across the road, as\nit happens, from the Exonian embassy\n\u2013 and yet, what with one thing and an-other, it was only this morning that I\nbrushed off the top hat and spats to pay\nHis Excellency a visit.\nI must explain that fear has played a\nsignificant part in my procrastination\nover this vital social function. Having neglected to register within the\nfirst two months after moving in, the\nthought crossed my mind that it would\nbe impolite of me to disturb them after\nso great a delay. Their reaction, more\nto the point, might also not be entirely\nfavourable. After two more months\nhad passed, I decided that it would be\nunfair to burden them with the additional paperwork, and nobly hid myself\nfrom their view.\nHaving experienced unpleasantness\nat the cold, merciless and hairy hands\nof Exonian officials in the past, the\nphrase \u2018once berned, twice shy\u2019 springs\nto the keyboard in an attempt to justify\nsuch hesitation. But, having fortified\nmyself with a shot of Humphrey Bogart walking purposefully away from the\ncamera, and steadied my nerves with\nan hour spent watching laundry both\nshaken and stirred in a large tumbler, I\ncrossed the threshold of my designated\nhome away from home at half past ten\nthis a.m.\nAnd this is where the tagline kicks\nin. The experience was, all in all, terribly anticlimactic. I walked through the\ndouble doors today in the desperate\nhope that hysterical bureaucracy and\ndiplomatic kerfuffliage would provide\nme with some incident worth relating.\nIt didn\u2019t need to be much \u2013 a trench-coated agent lurking in the corner,\narmed men escorting me off to some\nabandoned mountain retreat for further questioning: something, anything.\nAnything humorous, exciting or interesting would have gone down a treat.\nIn my desperation, dear readers, I\nhad clearly forgotten what my country\nstands for. While I would be loath to\npropagate the insulting generalizations\nthat have plagued my countrymen for\ngenerations, I think it only fair to inform you that when one considers the\nExonians, originality, humour and excitement do not race to the fore of the\nmind. These are not a people welded\ntogether by the spark of creativity.\nThe tiny hall of the embassy was in\nconsequence a nanocosm of Exonia \u2013\nthe same people, the same depressing\ndecorations, the same varnished wood\npanelling and crystallized glass surfac-ing, the same orderly piles of recycled\ngrey paper and floppy off-white hardback books found in any government\noffice back home. My chances of finding something amusing to relate from\nits interior are about as good as my\nchances of finishing a sentence without\nneeding to replace the comma key on\nmy keyboard due to overuse.\nThe result of my dreary yet mercifully short session with the uniformed\nand uninformed official is that I might\nstill be here next week; the necessary\nforms are still on my desk. We\u2019ll see.\nSlutty Pumpkin is an addict\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t help\nbut wonder: Is\nFacebook the\nnew drug of this\nmodern society?\nHow much can\nwe rely on this\nvirtual world?\u201d\nT\nhe other day, after spending more than two hours\none afternoon checking\nmy best friend\u2019s brother\u2019s\nex-girlfriend\u2019s sister pictures on facebook, I realised that I had\na problem. It\u2019s like when you first realize that you have an addiction, you always think it is harmless at first, that it\nis just a little reward. The next stage is\nwhen you finally convince yourself that\nthere is a problem and that the situation needs a change. So there I was,\nfeeling like a drug-addict in front of\nmy computer screen, with an immense\nguilt and a single question: \u201eDoes this\ngirl have any single picture with her\nnew boyfriend? And if yes, where are\nthose pictures? I need to see them.\u201c I\nstopped my train of thoughts right\nthere and closed internet. It was time\nto change my habits and spend more\ntime reading or doing the things I\ndid before this incredible Facebookphenomena started. But after searching in my memories for some time, I\nrealised that I didn\u2019t remember what\nthose things were. I couldn\u2019t help but\nwonder: Is Facebook the new drug of\nthis modern society? How much can\nwe rely on this virtual world?\nFacebook is supposedly a social-oriented website aiming to encourage\nand facilitate networking and bonding between people. With its many\napplications and its extensive profile\noptions, it\u2019s become very easy to show\nevery single picture that was in some\nlong-forgotten folder in your laptop or\nto inform the world on your immediate\npersonal status. As with any addiction,\nthere are also different grades of Facebook addiction. For example, I have\nto admit that I usually only check my\nprofile a few times a day but in short\nsessions, never more than ten minutes.\nBut I have already met people who\nreply immediately after you write on\ntheir walls. Each single time. Does this\nmean that they are permanently con-nected? If this is the case, these people\nwould be at the most advanced stage\nof addiction, and I fear it might not be\nreversible anymore.\nAll right, Facebook has something\naddictive about it, but what are the effects of this new drug? We know it is a\nsophisticated tool for networking and\ncommunication purposes. On Facebook, your profile is some sort of presentation card where you share your\ninterests and you create a story, your\nstory. But the problem is that it only\nrepresents a very narrow and selective\nfraction of reality. Some aspects might\nget distorted and this makes snap\njudgements and prejudices far easier.\nEvery time that I don\u2019t know a person\nvery well and go to their profile, I always end up making up their story with\nthe few pieces I find. And most of the\ntimes I can even describe the person\nin one word: crazy, fat, ugly, slut, bor-ing. Facebook has a huge scope, many\npeople are not aware of this. If before\npeople\u2019s lives and passions didn\u2019t leave\nthe four walls of their home before,\nnow it can reach hundreds and sometimes thousands of people. There is a\nconsiderate lack of privacy and need\nof exposure nowadays. But we need to\nstop sometimes and think: is this the\nway I want people to see me?\nEscaping Facebook wouldn\u2019t be the\nsolution. It would be a very lonely and\nalready-lost battle. I think we have\nto learn to live in these two parallel\nworlds \u2013the real and the virtual one-with our two identities and try to keep\nsome consistency. If the gap gets too\nbig, people might develop a wrong idea\nof you, and that\u2019s something we don\u2019t\nwant. I would even say that Facebook\nis that drug that Neo used to take in\n\u201cMatrix\u201d in order to jump between reality and the virtual world. Except that\nwe shouldn\u2019t jump from a building. It\nmight hurt.\nfelix has facebook. That makes us hip and cool... right?\n\u201cYou may not have known that if\nyou are caught in possession of\nmarijuana, you can be jailed for up\nto five years and face an unlimited\nfine?

With nothing\nto lose, I checked out the hyped\nup night of the moment, Bang\nFace. Yes, that\u2019s right, Bang Face.\nBilled as \u201cThe birth of neo-rave\u201d, Bang\nFace is a throwback to the early nineties rave scene. Remember those glow\nsticks, smiley faces and stobe lights?\nThe promotional material was full of\nall those cliches and more. It\u2019s hard to\ntell if, and how much, it was \u201ctaking the\npiss\u201d.\nI couldn\u2019t help but feel apprehensive\nabout the night of madness ahead. January\u2019s Bang Face was circus-themed,\n\u201ccelebrating the birth of the first modern circus on this day in 1768\u201d. We were\ninvited to dress accordingly, as clowns,\nacrobats, jugglers and trained animals.\nNot to be overly disparaging, it\u2019s not\nthe easiest theme to pull off.\nStill uncertain of what to wear, I\nbrowsed the Internet for help. Oh lucky\nme, to stumble across some eyebrow\nraising reviews of the 2008 Bang Face\nweekender. To paraphrase, they read \u2013\n\u201cI can\u2019t recollect much from the night,\nbut it was definitely fun\u201d! Suspiciously\nvague. I couldn\u2019t help but the assume\nthe author was off their face. There\nwere no explicit drug references but I\nthought I could read between the lines.\nIs this what Bang Face means? Get off\nyour face and mash up your head, like\nthey did in the early nineties?\nEnough. My verdict? Bang Face was\none of the most enjoyable club nights I\nhave been to in sooo long.\nI am ashamed to say I have no useful analysis to make of this night ei-ther. Before you also go jumping to\nconclusions \u2013 no, I hadn\u2019t taken any\nillegal substances (I don\u2019t agree with\nit ). So instead of a review with a neat\nchronological narrative, all I have to\npresent you with are a small selection\nof incoherent but amusing memories.\nThis is my reality, but probably not the\nbest review ever written. You had to\nbe there really to fully understand the\nBang Face conversion experience.\nThe circus theme was truly surreal!\nSome people really went the extra mile\nwith their circus costumes. I met a man\nin a clown costume on the dancefloor.\nIn a surreal haze of giggles, I was given\na fake blond stick-on moustache. Not\nin a sleazy way, you understand, just\nchildlike silliness. I say \u2018tache but this\nfacial accessory was passed around as\nan eyebrow, sideburn and beard before\nit was settled that it was a \u201cchest wig\u201d.\nIt\u2019s hard to say what was going on here.\nI think this illustrates the friendliness\nof the people and the creative \u2018anything\ngoes\u2019 vibe.\nThis is not to say everyone bothered\ndressing up as circus freaks. Quite to\nthe contrary. Most just came in jeans\nand quirky T-shirts. A few hooded\ntops were evident, as the temperature\noutside verged on minus figures. I\nthink this shows Bang Face is a place\nyou could just be yourself, not having\nto \u201cdress up\u201d hence \u201cact up\u201d as anything\nmore than you are. Pretence was left at\nthe door.\nElectrowertz was decorated DIY\nstyle, with amateurish A4 posters and\nbanners. Anywhere else this would\nhave looked rubbish but at Bang Face\nthe humour worked. From the \u201cSafety\nnets can just fuck off\u201d banner, to the\nclown lilo thrown overhead. The \u201cclub\nspace\u201d was symbolically appropriated\nby the crowd, a case of \u201cpower to the\npeople\u201d.\nAs for the music; acid, jungle, rave\nhardcore, drum \u2018n\u2019 bass, techno, elec-tro, breakcore AND electronica. The\nspecifics are hazy but I think it was\npretty effective as the dancefloor was\nrammed. We danced most of the night,\nwith lasers overhead and glow-sticks in\nhand. Some people could call it danc-ing, others might just call it embarras-ing random arm flailing, but we had\nfun.\nAfter a hard slog on the dancefloor,\nwe took a few moments to chill in\n\u201cChin Stroking Corner\u201d. Posters of\nGeorge Bush, Simon Cowell and \u201ca\nthoughtful looking baby\u201d, were hung\non the walls above us. We engaged in\ntopical conversation with a new acquaintance from Scotland. He declared\nDaft Punk at The Arches in Glasgow\nhis favourite ever club night. Chin car-ressing increased pace as conversation\nmoved on to Bang Face. \u201cIs this night\nmore than just nostalgia?\u201d I pondered.\nSo what is Bang Face all about? I have\nno rational or coherent explanation.\nNot that you need reason to have fun.\nThe closest analogy would be a very\nstrange house party. Bang Face is a bit\nsilly, but with a club full of fun, unpretentious people, how can you not have\na great time?\nYou know it\u2019s a good night when...\nyour memories are a vivid, incoherent\nmish-mash of euphoria and anecdote.\nI\u2019m not quite sure if this night felt real,\nbut it did happen. What\u2019s real anyway?\nAll we have are memories and you can\ntrust them, right?\nBang Face returns on Friday the 13th\nFebruary, with \u2018Vexed Factor\u2019 \u2013 a pop\ntarts, celeb whore theme.,\nIf one night just isn\u2019t enough, there\u2019s\nthe Bang Face weekender in April, except that has sold out.\nBang Face 63 HHHHH\n9th January\nElectrowertz, Torrens Street, EC1\nBest: Crowd\nWorst: To nit-pick, the toilets\nwere skanky.\nPrice: \u00a310\nCatherine Jones\nNightlife Editor\n...it\u2019s like\nTequila!\nI\nknow a few people around col-lege, who clearly have the winter blues. I have been one of\nthat pathetic group lately. It has\nbeen a cold bleak January but it\u2019s\nnot just the winter chill that has been\ngetting me down. Everyday pressures\ncan be a struggle to cope with, but the\nworld seems very negative lately.\nSome days I could barely muster the\nwill to get out of bed. On Monday 19th\nJanuary I probably should have made\nthe call and stayed beneath the duvet.\nUnfortunately, I have an almost scary\nenthusiasm for my subject, so I decided to go to class.\nBy late afternoon I had more than regretted that decision. After two chocolate bars and a gooey chocolate muffin,\nin what you could call an attempted\ncalorie overdose, I had reached rock\nbottom.\nI was informed by many news outlets it was \u201cBlue Monday\u201d, officially the\nmost depressing day of the year. Why?\n\u2013 Psychologist Dr Cliff Arnall\u2019s equation for depression says so. I am unsure\nof the scientific basis of this claim but\nI felt better knowing I was not the only\none feeling like shit.\nI kept on thinking about this Blue\nMonday thing. Is this more than some\nmedia myth? It\u2019s hard to say. It is the\ntime of year people think about buying holidays and yes, I felt ready to skip\nthe country on the next available flight.\nBrazil would be nice and yes, that\u2019s a\nhint.\nIt\u2019s a bit of a cliche but I think the\nMedia is like a shot of tequila. It\u2019s in-toxicating, but you should take it with\na pinch of salt, a bite of lemon and be\nprepared for a bitter aftertaste. Just try\nnot to vomit later on. And if you insist\non vomiting, please not on any item of\nmy clothing. Or anywhere near me.\nStillunsatisfiedwithlifeandashamed\nof my excessive comfort eating, I knew\nsomething had to be done. The solution seemed obvious; Blue Monday.\nI should be dancing to New Order\u2019s\n\u201cBlue Monday\u201d rather than feeling\nblue on a Monday.

What other society gives you\nthe opportunity to live in far-flung\nparts of the world with local people for\nweeks over the summer, gives you free\nevents like the photo exhibition last\nMonday, organises talks for you with\nsome of the most influential people in\nthe world, and gives you all the other\nmiscellaneous treats and events that\nEngineers without borders\nJoe Corcoran tells felix how Engineers Without Borders are\n\u201cremoving the barriers to development using engineering\u201d\nE\nngineers Without BordersImperial is one of around\n20 university branches that\nmakes up Engineers Without Borders-UK. The focus\nof EWB is \u201cto remove the barriers to\ndevelopment using engineering\u201d; what\nmakes us unique from various other\ncharities with similar aims is that EWB\nis run by students, for students. EWB\nis not just for engineers \u2013 many of our\nplacements are not degree specific\nand can often just require mathematical competence, a scientific outlook\nor project management skills. Almost\nall of our other events can be enjoyed\njust as much by non-engineers as\nengineers.\nonly EWB could? (On that note if anyone would like to come on a trip down\nthe London Sewers, let me know!)\nMost people associate EWB with the\nsummer placements in international\ndevelopment. The beauty of an EWB\nplacement is that they utilise the skills\nyou picked up by nearly killing yourself\nto pass Imperial exams. This tends to\nmean that you\u2019re doing something that\nnot a lot of people in the world could\ndo and hence you are probably doing\nsomething of genuine worth and use-fulness. You can rest assured that, on\nthe whole, EWB placements are more\nuseful than the majority of other gap\nyear voluntary schemes where you pay\na UK company to fly across the world\nto pat a baby lion on the head. Engineering development is notoriously\nhard to get into as a graduate with\nlittle experience. EWB gives students\nthe opportunity to gain that first bit of\nexperience that is invaluable when applying to graduate organisations like\nRedR.\nIf you would like to find out more\nabout placements, come along to the\n2009 Placements Launch event on 9th\nFeb, Mech Eng Room 342, 5.30pm.\nSpeaking of RedR, as you read this\nMartin McCann is probably speaking in Mech Eng Room 342 (Fri 30th,\n12.30-13.30). Martin McCann is the\nchief executive of RedR and must be\none of the most experienced and qualified men in development and disaster\nrelief in the world. This promises to be\nan informative and inspiring talk so if\nit\u2019s not too late; get running and come\nlisten! If it is too late then not to worry,\nbecome a member and we\u2019ll let you\nknow when our next talk is!\nEWB really does have something for\neveryone, engineer or not. We have\nwhen applying to the likes of ARUP\nor Mott MacDonald, a couple of our\nbiggest sponsors. EWB is such a well\nknown and deserving cause that attending any national events is bound\nto see you rubbing shoulders with all\nthe right people.\nLast summer three Imperial students\nwent on EWB placements. Amongst\nthese was Patricia Steven, 4th year\nMech Eng, who conducted an impact\nstudy into the existing improved cook-stove in Kathmandu, Nepal. The work\nincluded background research, community surveys, field testing, results\nanalysis and reporting. Patricia reports\nback \u2018Practically everyone studying at\nImperial has the opportunity to go on\nan EWB placement from first year entry summer placements to advanced\npost graduate work. Working with\nEWB as a student is the best opportunity you have to gain a placement in\ndevelopment and it is certainly an experience that I will never forget.\u2019\nIf you would like to get involved in\nor have any questions, please email\nguilds.ewb@imperial.ac.uk\njust launched our schools outreach\nprogramme, had a successful photo ex-hibition, guest speakers dropping by almost by the week, got a weekend training workshop coming up and that\u2019s not\nto mention the social events! We have\nbeen out for an authentic Ethiopian\nmeal at the weirdest restaurant I have\never been in and have camping trips,\nnights out and the EWB \u2018Battle of the\nBands\u2019 in the pipeline.\nOn a more superficial note, with the\ncredit of everything mentioned above,\ngetting involved in EWB provides a\ngem of a line on any CV. Especially\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing\nsomething that not\na lot of people could\ndo and are probably\ndoing something of\ngenuine worth\u201d\n\u201cIf anyone would like\nto come on a trip\ndown the London\nSewers, let me\nknow!\u201d\nS\no when did you first\nfind out what an engineer was? Several\nnon-engineers have\ntold me that if they\nhad known about engineering\nwhile at school, they might have\nchosen it for their degree. With\nthis in mind, three of us from\nEWB set off to Christ College,\nFinchley on Wednesday 21st to\ndo a workshop on \u2018Water for the\nWorld\u2019, including a presentation\non water sources, treatment and\nappropriate technology. After\nthis, we created crude water\nfilters out of plastic bottles and\nseveral filtering materials. They\nwere used to filter muddy water,\nwith varying results!\nThe aim of EWB outreach motto is \u201cto Inspire Today\u2019s Youth to\nEngineer a Fairer Future\u201d. A lot\nof people, especially children,\ndon\u2019t know what is involved in\nbeing an engineer, maybe due to the range of jobs that can be done by one. The skills that are learned\nby engineers can be used outside the traditional workplace and this is what EWB aims to get across.\nEngineers can make a real difference in people\u2019s lives by helping to build electricity generators, water\nsupplies or whatever is needed by people who can\u2019t afford (or don\u2019t have the skills) to do it themselves.\nThe outreach programme aims to get young people impassioned about international development and\nthe possibilities of taking an active role in improving people\u2019s lives. Although this may not be as exotic\nor glamorous as spending a few weeks in a far-flung part of the world, spending a couple of hours messing about with plastic bottles and muddy water can be quite rewarding and breaks the monotony of an\notherwise dull week at Imperial!\nEvery year EWB has a photo competition of images taken by students on\nplacements in international develop-ment. These photos illustrate the power engineers have to change the world\nand go some way towards capturing\nthe incredible experience of going on\nan EWB placement. The exhibition has\ntravelled around other EWB branches\naround the country but at Imperial the\nexhibition had an addition role almost\nunique to the college. It has been said\nthat EWB is the most powerful force\nin keeping graduates from moving\ninto banking. The photos show the\nhuge impact any engineer can have in\nchanging the world for the better; no\nplacement volunteer can lead a content life in banking after experiencing\nthe power they posses as an engineer.\nThe photos captured all the aspects\nof an EWB placement; not only the engineering worked on, but the culture,\nthe country, and most importantly the\npeople and the impact that it has had\non local life.\nThis year\u2019s winner was Joe Mulligan with his photo of school children\ncrossing a bridge he helped build. As\nThalia Konaris, former Imperial stu-dent, and former co-CEO of EWB-UK\nexplains \u2018Soweto East School Kids was\nchosen because it has a very original\nand appealing composition, it visually captures the essence of the project\ncombining final product with its most\ncritical users and also because it highlights the term appropriate in technologies for international development.\u2019\nWe were fortunate enough to have\nthe exhibition sponsored by the Institute of Mechanical Engineers. Andrew\nLamb the CEO of EWB-UK spoke at\nEngineers Without Borders \u2013 Joe Corcoran, EWB-Imperial President \u201cremoving the barriers to development using engineering\u201d\nthe event in front of the packed Mech\nEng Concourse saying \u2018It is so good to\nsee so many students from the cutting\nedge of science and engineering here\ntaking an interest in development. I\nhope they are all inspired by the photos\nto go and use their skills to make the\nchanges the world desperately needs.\u2019\nThe Institute of Mechanical Engineers were so enthusiastic about our\nexhibition that they asked if they could\nhost a day of the exhibition and reception evening. Last Wednesday the\nMarble Hall at the IMechE HQ was full\nto the brim with senior representatives\nfrom various institutes, companies and\ncharities involved in development. Richard Cunliffe, an Imperial student\nwho has been on an EWB placement\nspoke at the event and tells us that \u2018it\nis great to have the opportunity to actually show so many important people\nthe good work EWB has done. I\u2019m sure\nEWB-Imperial and the IMechE will\nhave plenty of opportunity to work together in the future.\u2019\nAndrew Lamb told assembled stu-dents: \u2018The population of the world\nhas tripled in my grandmother\u2019s lifetime and it\u2019s going to at least double\nagain just in my working life. 1.2 billion people don\u2019t have access to safe\ndrinking water, 2.4 billion people don\u2019t\nhave access to safe sanitation, 820mil-lion are underfed and 1.1 billion people\nare overfed, 3 billion people have never\nmade a telephone call and 3 billion\npeople have no grid electricity supply.\nOne out of every two people on this\nEarth lives in a city and one-third of\nthem, about 1 billion people, are living\nin slums.\nThe greatest engineering challenge\nof our time is not the Burj Dubai, is not\nthe London Olympics or Crossrail, the\nreturn to the Moon or a manned mis-Exhibition of photography taken on\nEngineers Without Borders placements\nJoe Corcoran\nImperial EWB President\nclubsandsocs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nClubs and Societies\nThomas Hills talks to felix about outreach projects run by Imperial\nEngineers Without Borders in local schools\nPHOTO: Steve LONG\nPHOTO: Tim Sadler\nPHOTO: Tim Sadler\nLily Ryan-Colins working with members of the El Abra community\nPHOTO: Dan Reader\nPHOTO:Drew Corbyn\nEWB volunteers help to assemble a wind turbine in the Philippines\nAndrew Lamb talking to students in the Mech Eng foyer\nsion to Mars, the development of carbon nanotubes or new forms of fuel.\nThe greatest engineering challenge of\nour time is captured in these photographs this evening. It\u2019s the challenge\nof people. We have to work together\nto inspire engineers to meet this chal-lenge. And there\u2019s a great deal of work\nto be done.\u2019\nSome of the photographs featured in\nthe exhibition can be see below.

A good chase from the kickoff and\nsustained pressure produced mistakes\nfrom Oxford giving IC a penalty which\nAlex Johnstone kindly slotted.\nThe first half carried on much the\nsame way with great pressure from IC\nkeeping their opposition firmly in their\nhalf. Oxford\u2019s saving grace was the boot\nof their fly half pinning IC back when\nthey got possession. When IC kicked\nthe chase was strong even from more\nunlikely members of the team, prop Joe\nSanders chasing his own hack through\nand winning a penalty. The pressure\ngave IC three more kickable penalties\nin the first half, all neatly put away. Indiscipline from Oxford in their own 22\ngave IC a penalty on their 5m line. The\nexcitement got the better of the IC fly\nhalf Joe Brown who took the decision\nQuintin Head 2009: It was a risky\nmove but Trapmore was confident the\nshort term losses would result in long\nterm gains. Quintin Head was ICBC\u2019s\nfirst head race of the year and was the\ndesignated purification race where all\nbad form was cleared out of storage\nand released in a total squad spring\ncleaning.\nInternational coaches concede that\nrowing detoxs are harmless but question the value of a \u2018Detox-Row\u2019 due to\nlack of supporting factual evidence.\n\u2018New-age\u2019 or \u2018Alternative\u2019 rowing is\na relatively new concept but ICBC is\nkeen to keep it\u2019s finger on the pulse of\nmodern rowing. Crews were quick to\nadapt to the system displaying poor\nrock-over, short strokes, late catches\nand lack of rhythm.\nThe three racing crews masterfully\nfulfilled the brief and finished down\nthe field with the highest result of the\nday third in WS2 and N.\n\u2018Viper\u2019 Fieldman coxed the senior\nwomen\u2019s 8+ (Louise Hart, Rachael Davies, Ellie Dorman, Erica Thompson,\nStef Menashe, Clarice Chung, ChrisTrapmore\u2019s \u2018Detox-Row\u2019 cleanses crews\ntina Matteotti & Chloe Symmonds).\nThe transfer from men\u2019s to women\u2019s\nboats had Fieldman struggling to make\ncalls; \u201cThat\u2019s good boys, eh, I mean\ngirls\u2026 Whatever, just row\u201d.\nThey came third (14:24.9) behind\nboat house neighbours Thames RC in\nsecond (14:29.2) and the overall WS2\nwinners City of Oxford (14:19.8).\nPressure has been on the women\u2019s\nsquad this year with seats hotly contested for the Women\u2019s Head of the\nRiver in March. Their ability to follow\nthrough the guidelines of the \u2018DetoxRow\u2019 is a credit to all involved.\nTemptations to perform well and\ndominate the race were brushed aside\nin true ICBC spirit.\nThe three novice boats were all suitably dissatisfied with their execution of\nrowing. The novice women narrowly\nescaped being coxed by Officer Duffy,\na predicament which may have permanently ended website race reports.\nLuckily the weathered hands of Libby\nRichards took control of the steering\nand cruised to a solid sixth place finishing (17:11.2) behind winners Kingston Grammar School (16:33.6).\nThe almost 40 second deficit was\nample time for the classic-mistake-stockpile to be exhausted.\nImperial I under the management\nof Cox Reddy came third in 14:06.8\nbehind University of Bristol in second\n(14:05.0) and Emanuel School in first\n(13:56.5) in the novice (N) category.\nImperial II were coxed by Kate Wylie\nand came an impressive 11th in the\nsame category (16:15.3), truly ridding\nthemselves of all rowing afflictions.\nThere were even rumours of an early\ncrab, but that may have just been fodder generated to impress coaching\nstaff.\nThe \u2018Detox-Row\u2019 was deemed a huge\nsuccess and ICBC\u2019s inadequate-rowing\nreserve was severely depleted over the\n4km race from Hammersmith to Chiswick Bridge.\nFollowing the bismal performances\nall crews reported improved health,\nenergy, vitality, resistance to disease,\nmental state, digestion as well as a noticed improvement in weight loss.\nStroke Louise Hart was even exhibiting signs of a new maternal instinct\nafter spotting Trapette Lucy at training\nthe following morning; \u201cAw\u2026 I can\u2019t\nwait to have children.\u201d\nChristina Duffy Cox Fieldman was initially dubious\nabout the visit but was relieved to discover that he was a few inches taller\nthan Lucy; a first for Henry at the club.\nTrapmore\u2019s manly reputation may be\nslightly tainted after being spotted carrying \u2018Monkey\u2019 and a miniture pink\numbrella around the gym.

You\nhave won a free kiss\nfrom felix editor\nand Rugby player\nextraordinaire Jovan Nedic. Kisses are available\nevery day, 10am \u2013 5pm to all genders in the\nfelix office in the west wing of Beit. Attractive\nladies are asked to bring tissues and all others\nshould have masks. No facial Herpes.\nScorpio\nIt\u2019s obvious that you\nare pretty. Pretty\nugly that is. I suggest\nyou go to Liverpool\nwhere you will look\npassable. If you really\nwant to look like a hot piece of flesh, make the\ntrek to deep-fried Scotland. They all look like\nproper munters up there- especially in Glasgow.\nIf there\u2019s one city that the world can do without-Glasgow would be it.\nLibra\nSo you think you\ngot rid of that extra\nweight you put on\nover Christmas. Well\nyou didn\u2019t and to\nmake things worse it\nwas your New Year\u2019s resolution to lose it. If it\nwasn\u2019t... look at the size of you! You\u2019re a fucking\nelephant, it damn should have been. You are fat\nverging upon clinically obese, you disgust me\nand all that surround you.\nCapricorn\nIt\u2019s heaven when\nyou manage to\nrelease your penis\nfrom your flies. This\nis an experience\nthat you will incur\nthis week as you rush from the toilet to your\n9am lecture. You don\u2019t make that 9am. Or in\nfact your 11am are you are in Chelsea and\nWestminster hospital. If you are a woman, or\nnot equipped with a willy ignore this. Pint?\nSagittarius\nThis week you\u2019ll\nmeet a girl, or\neven a boy in the\nUnion. But this is no\nnormal encounter.\nYou are besotted\nfrom first glance and proceed to yell \u2018I fucking\nlove you\u2019 over and over again. This is definitely\nnot due to the aforementioned cocaine that\nyou snorted whilst writing your article down in\nthe felix office. Needless to say, you failed.\nCancer\nThis week you\ndiscover the\nskin covering\nthe cartilage in\nyour septum has\ndisappeared. You\nhave never noticed this before, and become\nquite worried. Enough so to post questions on\nonline forums. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t have gone\non a drugs binge for 4 months, maybe you\nshouldn\u2019t have taken drugs full stop.\nGemini\nThis week a drugs\nraid on your room in\nyour hall has turned\nup unexpected\nresults. Along with\nthe expected drugs,\na child\u2019s body was found in your cupboard.\nCause of death, suffocation. Also found was a\nsnuff kit, gimp mask (complete with breathing\ntubes) and various spem filled tubes and\nglasses. Bukkake anyone?\nLeo\nThis week begins\nwith love and happiness in the air. The\nnew sense of inner\npeace is delightful,\nbut you know it\nwon\u2019t last. With two days of drudgery of Imperial behind you, you\u2019re once again hollow and\nempty inside. You long for that plane ticket\nback to Washington, \u2018oh Obama... I\u2019m coming\nto you, I long to kiss your presidential lips.\u2019\nTaurus\nThis week you\ndecide to kick your\nexpensive habit, and\nsubstitute it with red\nbull. You seem just\nas edgy, but begin to\nworry when you start urinating blood. Why is\nthis happening? How much red bull have you\nhad? Why am I now addicted to caffeine? You\nquickly take up some other addictive habit like\nsmoking to kick this one.\nAries\nYour friends taunt\nyou for being a coke\nhead. Teasing you\nas you spew out\nthe most random\nof sentences, while\nspeaking as quickly as possible. You think\neverything is normal until you get arrested for\npulling out a gun. Where the hell did you get\na gun? It came with the drugs of course. It\u2019s a\ndangerous world out there.\nPisces\nThis week, you\nthink about whether\nyou should buy\na ticket to the\nsummer ball while\nit\u2019s cheap, or blow\nthe money on a G of charlie. You opt for the\nlatter because you think it\u2019ll make that night\nout in Fulham slightly better. Unfortunately\nyou snort half in one line and throw up on the\nbouncers as soon as you get to the club.\nHorocokes, that\u2019ll be the Horoscopes on cocaine\nAquarius\nLook at the stars,\nlook how they shine\nfor you, look how\nall you do is poo...\nWell, that\u2019s all about\nto change. This is\nnot a rambling of a man that society has given\nup on like a 40 year old prostitute on laxatives,\nthings are on the way up. Just when you think\nthings couldn\u2019t get any worse, it all works out.\nYou get run over by a Robin Reliant.\nThis week felix got a large shipment of cocaine to help us through the long Wednesday night...

Though\nthese are often varied in\nconversation and cuisine\nthere is one common nut that I have\nyet to crack about dinner dates \u2013 who\npays the bill?\nThe date has gone smoothly so far\n(which was uncertain) but the certain\nbill is in the process of arriving. Now- I\ndon\u2019t know how every girl feels but I\nknow some find this the most awkward\npart of the date. Let\u2019s break this down\ninto the different situations.\nThis is your first dinner date with\nthis guy, perhaps the first date at all.\nThe ceremonial bill paying act is often\nan indication of how they feel about\nthe relation and even how they judged\nyour company for the date. Bad as it\nmay sound, I expect the boy to pay on\nthe first date. Without a doubt. Even if\nhe thought my company was comparable to a slug.\nOkay okay, maybe I am a tad spoilt.\nTalking to a friend who often finds\nit awkward I found that there are a\nnumber of techniques that girls have\nlearned to employ in order decrease\nthe awkwardness of the situation. Two\nof my favourites are the after-dessert\npowder room escape and the other\nis the gesture of looking around in a\nhuge Mary Poppins sized hand bag\nfor a wallet they just can\u2019t find amidst\nevery other imaginable item you could\nexpect to get into a bag... Oh diddums!\nI call this the bag drill.\nYou know maybe it\u2019s a culture thing.\nMany of my European friends stand\nguard to the fact that they would never\nconsider letting a girl pay, friend or not\nfriend, first date or not... Gosh I am\nmaking the French seem exponentially\nmore desirable! Not that they needed\nmy help.\nIf it is possible it is perhaps it\u2019s nice\nto wait a few months into the relationship to start letting the girl \u201cgo-dutch\u201d\nor even pay for the dinner.\nI know the guys reading this by now\nare probably thinking, \u201cyou have to be\nkidding me\u201d, \u201cwe would be broke by\n\u201cMy European\nfriends would\nnever let a girl\npay. Gosh \u2013 I\nam making the\nFrench seem\nexponentially\nmore desirable!\nNot that they\nneeded my help\u201d\nI\n\u2019m honestly not sure why my\nparents bothered taking my\nbrother and me on holiday each\nyear. It\u2019d end up with a guaranteed tantrum, floods of tears,\nburst blood vessels, and an unjustified\nharassing by Immigration Officers. No\nmore complaining though, because I\nhave escaped family holidays: my personal interpretation of annual Hell-onEarth. For a few years now, I revel in\nthe choices I get: whom I travel with\nand to where.\nWhom do I thank for this new-found\ninternational freedom? Irish entrepreneur and Ryanair Chief Executive\nMichael O\u2019Leary. In fact, the same\nMichael O\u2019Leary that Kawai Wong\nhad apparent nightmares about in her\ncomment piece last week. Granted, any\ndream about an Irish middle-aged sugar daddy is probably not the epitome\nof bliss. If this man is the devil himself,\nspank my arse and call me a Satanist as\nI gladly fall to my knees at his achieve-ments. He has opened up the rest of\nthe Europe for students, amongst the\never-increasing number of people living on a tight budget (I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t mention a certain economic crisis in this article, but it looks\nlike I\u2019ve failed).\nRyanair is marketed as a no-frills\nbudget airline. It does not pretend to\noffer the very best air travel service,\nbecause in fact, there isn\u2019t much of a\nservice that they provide. It is more of\na \u2018make sure everyone is in the glorified tin can they call the plane\u2019 job.\nHence, I expect a little hassle when I\nfly with Ryanair. I expect to race the\nAmerican family for seats on the plane\nwhen boarding. A little elbow here, a\nlittle knee-jerk there. It\u2019s all part of the\nfun of flying no-frills. When you line\nup at the terminal gate priming yourself for the sprint across the runway\nto the plane, there is an open declaration amongst fellow travellers; one that\nsays \u201cwe\u2019re all poor, but we also want\nto go on holiday, so we are taking this\nquestionable flight at 5.30 on a Sunday\nmorning to get to Xante.\u201d\nKawai should not complain. I do not\nsee any justification of her fanciful\ngrumble on the detriments of budget\nair travel. She admits herself that she\nknows exactly what is to come when\nshe books her cheap flight to Milan.\nI think any monkey that understands\nthe ethic of these increasingly emerging budget airlines knows what to ex-pect; all of the above hustle and bustle.\nShe claims she must \u201cphysically\ntrawl\u201d her bag directly off the plane\nonto more public transport to her ho-tel. I like the fact I can choose whether\nto place a bag in the hold. If I\u2019m vain\nenough to think I need more clothes\nthan sense, I will pay the extra \u00a38. The\ncosts are only \u201chidden costs\u201d if you\ncan\u2019t be bothered to look and read your\ne-ticket, e-confirmation, and e-every-thing else they load your inbox with.\nThe airports that Ryanair flights land\nat are peripheral city airports, hence\ncheaper for Ryanair, and hence us. I\u2019m\nquite sure they wouldn\u2019t commission\nflights out to the middle of Rural Arseholia. The second or third airport\nof a large European city will always,\nwithout fail, be a taxi ride away from\ncity centre. Even Heathrow, the busiest airport in the world pushes its tag\nas \u201cLondon Heathrow\u201d. Most Ryanair\nflights now land in the destination\ncity\u2019s main airport. Dublin and Berlin\nfor example, two major destinations,\nuse the same runways as British Airways or Lufthansa.\nKawai\u2019s article insinuates a lack of\nprofessionalism and effort on the Ryanair cabin crew\u2019s part. Contrary to\nKawai\u2019s experience, every time I have\nflown with Ryanair, the stewardesses\nhave indeed had \u201cthe decency to tie\nup their hair\u201d. Not that it would bother\nme if they hadn\u2019t. I don\u2019t term \u2018being\ndecent\u2019 as having hair tied up, \u2018airhostesses\u2019 or not. Budget airline cabin crew\nare professional enough. If you act like\na cock to cabin crew because you think\nthey are undermined as people due to\ntheir occupation and employers, you\ndeserve a bit of a bite back. These people are, as well as trying to flog every\nsingle fucking thing under the sun to\nyou from a catalogue, trained to take\ncare of you as you perilously float several thousand feet above ground.\nI fail to see how it is Ryanair\u2019s fault in\nyou spending the first day of your holiday asleep in your hotel. Did the horrors of unkempt stewardess hair keep\nyou awake for the rest of the time?\nSo, the next time you\u2019re in the \u201cZdeck\u201d of a budget airline plan (because\nby your own admission you will make\nthe \u201cmistake\u201d of taking one again), enjoy the polyphonic Irish music as you\nsettle into your horrifically coloured\nseat, be a tiny bit tempted by the \u00a312\nstuffed airplane in the catalogue, and\nkeep in context what you have paid in\ncomparison to what you are getting;\ncheap international freedom.\nRyanair will never usurp the giants\nof airspace as one of the major intercontinental airlines. It is simply not in\ntheir business plan to do so. Despite\nbeing a self-proclaimed \u201ccommoner\u201d,\nKawai sadly emits a skewed vapour of\nsnobbery from her writings. I\u2019m sorry,\nbut an article that is seven eighths rant\nabout how shite Ryanair is, and one\neighth of, quite frankly, weakly explained fears of market domination by\nbudget airlines does not make happy or\nsatisfying reading.\nI believe the point I am making,\nand not directly to Kawai because she\nwrites commendably, is that a rant can\nbe an excellent read. I would know, because most of my Comment pieces and\nEditorial columns end up as vents of\nanger. But they need to be in context of\nthe subject matter. It is so effortless to\nget carried away in the stream of hate-riddled consciousness, so much so that\na piece loses sight of the initial point\nthe author initially set out to put across\nto the readers.\nAs I step back into the shadows of the\nfelix office for another week, I take no\nbow, but neither a whimper of shame\nfor the writings of the felix team or the\nstudent body. felix will always print\nyour views, opinions and expressions.\nThe ones you have been meaning to\nwrite for months, the ones you\u2019ve written on the spur of the moment, and\nespecially the ones on issues you most\ncare about.\nDan Wan will fly cheaply and expect nothing\nP\nerhaps you missed me.\nThat\u2019s understandable. Perhaps the start of term was\nall a little too much for you,\nand you felt a bit scared, a bit\nretreating. And then, to make matters\nworse, the smiling, friendly demeanour\nof good old A Geek isn\u2019t even there to\ncomfort you at the end of week. That\ncan be a little shocking. But it\u2019s alright.\nDaddy\u2019s right here.\nThough I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019ve not been\nin great shape recently, hence my ab-sence. Yeah. I\u2019ve taken a few knocks\nlately, a few shocks to the old system,\nand I\u2019m getting old so I can\u2019t always\ntake them on the chin like I used to. For\ninstance, the other day I was exposed\nto a member of the Imperial Business\nSchool for thirty-five minutes \u2013 that\u2019s\nonly ten minutes below the lethal dos-age, remember. Doctors have spent the\nlast week flushing my systems and trying to heal up as much of the damaged\nbrain tissue as possible, but they\u2019ve\nsaid that I could be affected for life.\nIt\u2019s a sad truth that one in three of\nus will be affected by the life-changing\ntrauma of the Business School at some\npoint in our lives. Many often are completely unaware of the Business School\ninfecting their degree for many months\n\u2013 early symptoms, such as new lecturers dressed in suits, or courses offering\nAngry Geek survived, but not everyone does\nskills in \u2018management\u2019, go missed by\nmost students thanks to a poor education in the severity of the condition.\nLast week, my girlfriend found thick\ntextbooks with diagrams of \u2018group layouts\u2019 in them on my desk at home. I\u2019d\nbrought them home a few days ago and\nleft them there not realising. When my\nshe noticed this, we immediately called\nthe doctor\u2019s surgery and they agreed to\nadmit us the following day. Unfortunately, it was already too late. The next\nmorning, before my admission to the\nhospital, I went back to Imperial without realising which lecture course was\naffecting me, and found myself in the\nmiddle of a classic case of a Business\nSchool Teaching attack.\nMy girlfriend rushed me out and to\nAccident and Emergency as soon as\nwe realised, of course, but at that point\nmuch of the damage had been done.\nI\u2019d been exposed to damaging analogies with nonsensical explanations for\notherwise extremely simple concepts;\nfaltering and vague promises that\nmanagement affects every part of my\nlife and is really useful; and excerpts\nfrom the Financial Times, or \u2018the silent\nkiller\u2019 as it\u2019s known in medical circles.\nI was rushed to St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital\nin London and treated with an intensive course of antibullshitics, regular\ndoses of Engineering Mathematics,\nthe end of it\u201d. But if you see, we spend\na lot more money on things that you\nget to enjoy about women. We have to\nspend on cosmetics (not just make-up,\nmaybe creams), we have to shave/wax/\ntweeze...\nI could go on. All this to look attrac-tive... so a dinner isn\u2019t too much to ask?\nNo?\nYou see, I don\u2019t deem paying the bill\nas a monetary act; more as a symbolic\nact of how much effort or commitment\nthe person wants to display to you. Just\nif I turned up on a date making no effort to look nice; hairy arms, messy\neyebrows, uncombed hair.... Exactly.\nI\u2019m more than happy to pay for a round\nof drinks before or after the meal just\nnot the main event. I\u2019ll do the frills, you\nbake the cake.\nThere was this one time I was out\non a friendly dinner date with a guy\nfriend. The bill came to the table next\nto us and the guy pulled out his card\nready for the waiter. The card was rejected and there was this awkward si-lence. The girl rushed to her bag and\npulled out her card.\nBy this time the whole restaurant\nhad quietened down. I\u2019m not sure who\nfelt more embarrassed, the guy or the\ngirl. Because that is exactly it, the fact\nis that the girl looked embarrassed because it is a bit taboo.\nThe best dinner date I have ever\nbeen on was when a guy from the city\ntook me to a plush oriental restaurant\nand didn\u2019t expect a thing afterwards.\nWalked me home and didn\u2019t even try\nto make a move on me even though it\nwas a really flirty atmosphere.\nIf any guys have made it to the end of\nthis article, I congratulate you. I realise\nthis isn\u2019t the most guy-friendly column\nin felix, but it\u2019s all about diversity as\none columnist wrote. Valentines day is\nround the corner and if you are taking\na girl out, spoil her for the night. She\u2019ll\nappreciate it more than you can tell.\nand a series of therapy sessions where\nI was assured that money was not eve-rything, that Imperial did still contain\nscientists, and that unfortunately, accreditation with professional bodies\ncomes at a price.\nI was one of the lucky ones. But the\ndifficult truth is that thousands more\nlike me are struck down every day by\nthe addictive qualities of the Imperial Business School. Many have been\nsighted sneaking out of their departments to attend \u2018Entrepreneurship\u2019\ncourses, something which worries the\nlocal police authorities.\n\u201cWe see people loitering around\nthe entrance here,\u201d one security guard\nexplained to me, \u201cpretty much every\nday. Sometimes they, you know...\u201d he\npauses while he tries to find the words,\nbut he just can\u2019t, \u201cAch, they\u2019re throwing their lives away. Good people, you\nknow? One day, they\u2019re walking past\nin jeans and ironic t-shirts, and you\nthink, \u2018Yeah. There goes one of the\ngood guys.\u2019 but you\u2019ll come by late at\nnight, and there they\u2019ll be, hunched in\na corner by the revolving doors, trying\nto inject champagne or some shit right\ninto their eyeballs. Makes you sick.\u201d\nWhile the BBC\u2019s Panorama team\nconduct investigations into the spread\nof Business School dealers throughout Imperial, or \u2018lecturers\u2019 as they\u2019re\nknown, all I can do is beg you to stay\nvigilant, and keep an eye on your\nfriends. If you\u2019ve not seen one of your\nclassmates in regular lectures, or if you\nfear they may be reading the Business\npullouts from their newspapers instead\nof the cartoons page, please don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch by emailing anan-grygeek@googlemail.com.\nTogether, we can combat Business\nSchool teaching. Forever.\n\u201cThe harsh truth\nis that thousands\nmore like me\nare struck down\nevery day\u201d\nWe thought we\u2019d lose him. The management speak attacked his central nervous system. We were scared.\nWanted: dead or alive or cooked in garlic butter\nA\nweek ago, Swirly was just\na lowly slime-mongerer,\nrummaging in bins in\nsearch of credit card de-tails. It is now rumoured\nthat he is the next Robert Mugabe and\nis slated to have strong connections\nwith Mauritian gangsters.\nHow did he achieve this sudden no-toriety? Using the profit made from his\nidentity theft business, Swirly hired\ntwo moronic accomplices who were\nable to integrate him into human so-ciety. That\u2019s right readers, Swirly is a\nsnail!\nHe has purposefully targeted the gullible and simple-minded members of\nthe British public, luring them with an\nadorable fluffy pink fa\u00e7ade. Even students of Imperial College, renowned\nfor their high levels of intellect, have\nfallen for this cheap ruse.\nThe two accomplices, who cannot be\nnamed for legal reasons, assisted Swirly\nin scouring the Nation for those of an\nimpressionable nature. This search\nnaturally took him North, specifically\nto Manchester, where the population\u2019s\nNeanderthal mentality made the manipulative process considerably easier.\nAlthough he originally set out to infiltrate a city with a comparatively lower\naverage IQ, the burning car on the side\nof the A57 even dissuaded the apparently fearless Swirly from entering\nLiverpool.\nNevertheless, with Swirly\u2019s power\ngrowing day by day, it is imperative that\nwe make a stand against this malicious\nmoist menace! It is understood that\nhe possesses one weakness, known to\nonly to his most devout followers. MI5\nare working tirelessly to bring down\nthis up-and-coming dictator.\nHis ridiculously meteoric rise to\nfame has caused a stir within the Imperial fraternity, and a small, dedicated\nband of freshers have rallied to oppose\nhis tyrannical rule. Those few among\nus, who have been brave enough to\nstand against this cult leader, have\nformed a coalition group and are currently recruiting members to assist in\nour guerrilla operations. If you can offer skills and expertise in snail hunting,\nmolesting or general mutilation, join\nthe alliance today: \u2018Swirly is a C**t!\u2019.\nThis group may be found on a certain\nsocial networking site, whose name\ncannot be mentioned for extreme security reasons.

At the time, the used alphabet\nwas Cyrillic, yet the main problem was\nthat the literary level in the country\nwas very low. Words were not spelled\nin an intuitive way and as such, made\nit a very difficult language to learn if\nyou were not brought up on it. In 1818,\nKarad\u017ei\u0107 reformed the whole language\nwith the basic principal that \u201cyou write\nas you speak and read as it is written\u201d.\nIn essence, the entire Serbian language\nwas made phonetic!\nThe current state of the English language could, at least by foreigners, be\ndescribed as in the same way. Unintuitive, unclear and extremely difficult for\npeople to learn are some ways of describing it. Heck, I\u2019m still learning the\nins and outs of the language and how\nI can gain access to the \u2018wealth\u2019 and\n\u2018richness\u2019 of the language.\nAs a quick side note, I don\u2019t really\nsee the point of using elaborate words,\neither spoken or in written text. By\nusing these complex words instead of\ntheir simpler counterpart, you are effectively excluding a large proportion\nof the UK...\nThe relatively high levels of illiteracy in the UK compared to the rest of\nEurope got me thinking. What would\nhappen if Karad\u017ei\u0107 was still alive and\ndid the same to the English language\nas he did to the Serbian. Would the literacy levels rise, would people find the\nchange easy and would foreigners find\nthe language a lot easier to pick up?\nBut where would you start? If you ask\nme, I would start with the letter C.\nThink about this question: is there\nany word in the English language\nwhere the letter C cannot be replaced\nby another letter in the English lan-guage, or where it is not used to make\na \u2018CH\u2019 sound?\nI have asked this question to a few\npeople and the initial response has\nnormally been \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot!\u201d. But\nafter they thought about it for a while,\nthey began to realise what I was trying to say. Honestly, what is the point\nof the letter C? Most of the words that\nwe managed to come up with could\neither have the letter K or the letter S\ninstead. For example, looking at the title of the piece next to mine, the word\n\u2018attractive\u2019 could quite as easily be spelt\n\u2018attraktive\u2019. Another example would\nbe the word \u2018decision\u2019 which could be\nspelt as \u2018desision\u2019. As a solution, an idea\nI had was to not scrap the letter C, but\ninstead make it a \u2018CH\u2019 sound and replace all the words affected with either\n\u2018K\u2019, \u2018S\u2019 or \u2018CH\u201d. So, for example, \u2018much\u2019\nwould become \u2018muc\u2019.\nFor those of you with an A-Level in\nEnglish might try and use the argument that the \u2018C\u2019 creates a soft sound\nin a word. But why can\u2019t it just have a\nT infront as is the case of \u2018pence\u2019, which\ncould just be \u2018pents\u2019.\nThe most likely argument against\nchange, I imagine, would be that any\nchanges to the language would destroy\nit. But would it destroy it even more or\nwould it mean that it would be easier\nfor people to learn. After all, it is the\nmost widely spoken language.\nAnyway, this can go on for a while, so\nI leave it to all of you to find me a use\nfor the letter C, because at the moment\nI\u2019m really struggling.\nHe might be tyrannical, but anythings better than the Ant People!!!\n\n"

If, like me, you opt\nfor a matinee of the play because you\nactually want to get home a sensible\ntime, beware you will be sharing the\nauditorium purely with gray-haired ladies who lunch and the National lobby\nwith school groups. These old ladies\ngenerally sit around you and natter\nabout whether Tracy Letts, the author,\nis male or female. For the record, Tracy\nLetts is male. He just has a girls\u2019 name.\nAugust: Osage County focuses on\nthe reunion of the extended Weston\nfamily after its patriarch, alcoholic\nacademic Beverly (again with the girls\u2019\nname?!), goes missing after hiring Native American housekeeper, Johnna,\nto look after his unorthodox house.\nBeverly and his pill pushing, mouth\ncancer suffering wife Violet rarely eat\nand have the windows covered over\nso that the stiflingly hot house is indeterminable between day and night.\nAct one is concerned with the family\nrejoining at the Weston house. First to\narrive are middle daughter Ivy, whom\nViolet think is too dowdy and boring,\nand Violet\u2019s sister, Mattie Fay, and her\nhusband Charles. Later the other Weston children return; eldest Barbara\nwith husband Bill Fordham and daughter June, and youngest Karen with new\nfianc\u00e9 Steve Heidebricht. Finishing off\nthe family gathering is Mattie Fay and\nCharles\u2019 son Little Charles.\nThe entire show happens within one\nglorious set; a lifesize, minimalist,\nthree story doll\u2019s house complete with\nveranda and loft conversion.

On the bright side I\u2019m\nold enough for my parents to ply me\nwith booze of significantly better quality than what gets served in my student\nflat.

Each\nmember of the Weston family has their\nown problems to bring to the melting\npot of dysfunction with very few of\nthem being resolved. Most plays start\nwith introducing the problem and\nspend most of the time analysing and\nsolving the problem- that is they follow\n\u201cPropp\u2019s theory\u201d.\nThe theory of Vladimir Propp was\nthat every piece of storytelling can\nfit into seven different basic stories.\nEach of these stories has thirty one\nplot points and a certain number\nof \u201ccharacter types\u201d. August: Osage\nCounty not only throws Propp out of\nthe window but then takes chunks of\nbroken window pane and stabs him in\nthe heart. I think this helps to make\nthe three and half hours fly by \u2013 the\nstoryline and characters do not follow\nthe norm.\nThere isn\u2019t a single bad link in the\ncompany, probably attributed to the\nlong period of time they have spent\ndeveloping the piece. The cast could\nreally pass off as a regular, if rather\ndisturbed, family. I took a while to feel\ncomfortable with Deanna Dunagan\u2019s\nViolet. She swings from being off her\nhead in the opening scene to being\ncompletely normal in the next. Even\nconsidering the character\u2019s drug and\nheath problems this seemed extreme.\nShe eventually settles down into a comfortable middle ground and establishes\nherself as the star of the show, with her\nmonologue at the dinner table as a dis-Annie Leibovitz: living a dual life?\nEmilie Beauchamp sees the Annie Leibovitz: A Photographer\u2019s Life exhibition at the National Portrait\nGallery as not just a gallery of celebrity photographs, but as an insight into a very personal life\nM\nany artists are known\nprimarily by their\nmasterpieces rather\nthan by their name.\nThis is especially the\ncase in photography, where so many\nauthors\u2019 rights are given to agencies\nin the tangle for celebrity. Therefore, if\nI mention Annie Leibovitz, not many\nwould know exactly who she is, however famous she is in the field of portrait photography. Already established\nby the mid-70s, she worked as chief\nphotographer for the magazine Rolling Stone before working freelance for\nVanity Fair, Vogue and The New Yorker. During that period she snapped\ncelebrities such as the Beatles, the\nRolling Stones, Nicole Kidman, Daniel Day Lewis, Queen Elizabeth II and\nuncountably more. Some may say that\nif you have not been before her lenses\nyou are not quite a star yet...\nThe exhibition Annie Leibovitz: A\nPhotographer\u2019s Life 1990-2005 was\nfirst presented at the Brooklyn museum in 2006 and is now being featured at the National Portrait Gallery\nuntil Sunday February 1st. Most of the\npieces displayed are part of her iconic\nA\nthree and a half hour play\nwhere not very much\nhappens and one of the\ncharacters mainly speaks\nnonsense\u2013doesn\u2019tsound\ntoo appealing, does it? Yet somehow I\nwas desperate to see August: Osage\nCounty. It sweeped the Tonys winning\nBest Play, Best Leading Actress (Dean-na Dunagan), Best Featured Actress\n(Rondi Reed), Best Director (Anne\nD. Shapiro) and Best Scenic Design\n(Todd Rosenthal) and was awarded\nthe Pulitzer Prize for Drama this year.\nThe National Theatre\u2019s production has\nbrought over much of the original cast,\nincluding Dunagan and Reed, and supplemented it with experienced players\nfrom the original Steppenwolf Company where the play originated.\nThis includes Gary Cole of Dodgeball, Talladega Nights and The Brady\nTo be honest I always preferred Orange County\nPossibly Annie Leibovitz\u2019s most famous photograph\nHOW COOL IS THIS? Who knew we had a theatre named after us??\nturbing yet realistic centrepiece.\nI also felt drawn to Ivy and Little\nCharles as the black sheep of their respective families. Sally Morton and Ian\nBarford gave beautifully understated\nperformances culminating in a touching romance and one of the biggest plot\ntwist of the night (I won\u2019t give anything\naway but WOAH!).\nComingfromafamilyofthreedaughters, I spent much of the play worrying\nthat my family would evolve into the\nchaotic Weston family (little chance of\nthat \u2013 for a start my family is teetotal).\nAs the middle child I saw a lot of myself\nin Ivy, and her character made me realise some things about myself I didn\u2019t\nlike too much. But this is what a good\nplay should do; affect you so much that\nyou start to question yourself and your\nsurroundings even after you leave the\ntheatre.\nportraits collection, always elegant and\ngrandiose, denoting an atypical, often\nprovocative, collaboration with the\nsubjects and featuring amazing lighting work. Some of her most famous\nphotos are the nude and pregnant\nDemi Moore cover for Vanity Fair and\nWhoopi Goldberg submerged in a bath\nof milk, but sensibly all of her art has\nbeen widely acclaimed and all her campaigns were successful.\nHowever, what makes the exhibition truly interesting are the personal\nphotographs that are displayed. In fact,\nwhile the period 1990-2005 was very\nsuccessful career-wise for Leibovitz, it\nwas also one full of ups and downs in\nher personal life. From child memories\nto the death of her father and of her\npartner Susan Sontag, as well as the\nbirth of her three daughters, Leibovitz\nexposes pieces of her private life and\nshares with the public the story behind\nthe camera. Portraying scenes often\nintimate but always touching, they\ncontrast deeply from her commercial\nworks. The latter being bigger than\nnature and cosmetic, her personal artwork is of a fragile, almost naive truth.\nIn any case, she depicts perfectly balanced worlds every time...\nMost of the personal stories displayed concern Leibovitz\u2019s partner, or\nlover as she later declared, writer Susan\nSontag. They met in 1989, both already\nestablished in their respective career,\nand Sontag is said to have had a huge\ninfluence on Leibovitz from then on.\nShortly after they met, Leibovitz started exploring different, deeper themes\nsuch as the siege of Sarajevo during the\nwar in the Balkans, a publication of a\ncollection (entitled Women) exploring the characters of women from all\nclasses all over the world, and even\nexperimention in landscape photog-raphy. In 1998, Sontag was diagnosed\nwith breast cancer and then started the\nlong journey until her passing away in\n2004. Leibovitz loyally photographed\nvarious phases of the illness and accompanied Sontag at every stage.\nWhat could seem at first like a curious documentation of the illness might\nbe interpreted as a way for Leibovitz\nto separate herself from the situation\nor even escape it, but feels more like\nthe natural continuation of the genuine relationship between her, Sontag\nand photography, as well as a manner\nin which to go through mourning. In\nthat sense, the exhibition itself is an essential part of that process, displaying\nphotos of Sontag from the first doctor\u2019s appointment to her lying on her\nvery death bed. Surprisingly enough,\nthese are far from being disturbing;\nwitnessing a desire to face what lies\nin front and in the end say one last\ngoodbye. More joyful memories are\nalso displayed such as Leibovitz\u2019s three\ndaughters, the first born when she was\n51 years old, followed by twins from a\nsurrogate mother 3 years later.\nOverall, it can seem from her exhibition that Leibovitz was living a dual life\nthrough her photography: provocative\nand superficially aesthetic, or reflective\nand beautifully simple. Maybe Sontag\nhelped her to reconcile her two sides,\nand in the end Leibovitz declared in\nthe exhibition\u2019s book: \u201cI don\u2019t have two\nlives. This is one life, and the personal\npictures and the assignment work are\nall part of it\u201d. Was it really? For the\nslightly excessive amount of \u00a39 (don\u2019t\nforget your student ID!), you can judge\nfor yourself until February 1st...\nAnnie Leibovitz is on at the\nNational Portrait Gallery until 1st\nFebruary 2009.\nHere is one of the nasties in jars from the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Science (flip over the\npage for the main review!). I\u2019m not sure what it is, but it certainly has a fine set of tentacles\nWe leave you the choice: obvious joke or mature respect for an artist?\n\n"

    "content": "12 felix Friday 30 January 2009\nA recent poll suggests that communication between doctors and patients\nis improving. Published this month\nby the Healthcare Commission, the\nsurvey of patient satisfaction revealed\nthat 83 percent of patients feel their\ndoctors listen to them and 70 percent\nfelt actively involved in any decisions\nto undergo treatment. These figures\nare a significant rise from the last survey in 2005.\nChief Executive of the Commission, Anna Walker, praised the \u201cvery\npositive\u201d findings of the survey, but\nsaid further improvements are still\nrequired.\nAt the University of Cambridge, staff\nwithin the School of Clinical Medicine\nare working to educate future doctors\nin successful and active communica-tion. Research suggests that more effective care could potentially reduce\nthe current burden on the NHS caused\nby high readmission rates.\nHowever, Jonathan Silverman, Associate Clinical Dean of the school expressed caution over the survey findings and felt doctors should be more\nconcerned with why the remaining 17\npercent were not fully happy with the\nservice.\nThe survey also showed that although elderly patients were most\nsatisfied overall with the care they re-ceived, this did not result from better\ncommunication with their doctor. After the 16-29 age group, over-75s were\nthe least impressed with the information they were given, often finding it\nlacking in detail or hard to understand.\nThis may be one of the factors responsible for a rise in readmission of elderly patients from 10 percent to nearly\n14 percent within the last decade.\nIt is hoped that these surveys can\nhighlight areas for improvement within the NHS, and give a much-needed\nmorale boost to doctors in the UK.\nDoctors\u2019\ncommunication is\nimproving\nCould your diet success be affected\nby the magazine that you read? Researchers from Newcastle University\nhave uncovered that UK magazines\nare filled with adverts for mostly sug-ary, salt-filled, low-fibre foods thereby\nconfusing any health messages their\narticles were trying to put across.\nIn the top 30 most widely read magazines in the UK, over 25% of the food\nadverts were for ready meals. Almost\nthe same amount were for foods \u201ccontaining fat or sugar,\u201d e.g. ice-cream,\nchocolate bars, sweets and full sugar\nsoft drinks.\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s up to each of us to decide what we eat\u201d said Dr Jean Adams,\nof Newcastle University. \u201cBut if we\u2019re\nconstantly bombarded with images\nof unhealthy food every time we pick\nup a magazine then we\u2019re going to be\nswayed in what we choose.\u201d\nThe study, published in this month\u2019s\nEuropean Journal of Public Health,\nfound key differences between magazines with different readerships. More\nadverts for high fat/sugary foods were\nfound in magazines aimed at women,\nor with readers of a lower social class;\nboth groups that suffer high levels of\nobesity. In contrast, very few of the ads,\nonly 1.8%, were for fruit and vegetables and these were mainly in high-end\nmagazines.\nMagazines give mixed\nmessages with healthy ads\nWhilst this research doesn\u2019t link adverts directly with people\u2019s decision\nmaking/eating habits, junk food ads are\nalready banned from children\u2019s magazines in the UK because of fears over\nincreasing levels of obesity.\n\u201cHealth bodies and the government\nare trying to encourage all of us to eat a\nhealthier diet, yet we found that many\nof the magazines, especially those targeting lower-income families are full of\nadverts promoting food that is largely\nunhealthy,\u201d says Dr Adams,\n\u201cIt\u2019s a battle to stay on the right track\nwhen choosing and preparing meals\nand these adverts do little to help.\u201d\nA new study suggests that apple juice\ncould delay the onset of age-related\ncognitive diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease. Researchers from the University of Massachusetts found that mice\nreceiving the human equivalent of\ntwo glasses of apple juice per day for a\nmonth performed better than normal\nmice in maze trials. Not only did they\nperform better but the decline in performance observed when the mice got\nolder was not seen in the mice given\napple juice.\nThe team found that mice given apple juice produced less of a protein\nfragment, called beta-amyloid. This\nprotein fragment is known to form\nplaques in the brain, commonly found\nin Alzheimer\u2019s patients. They believe\nthe reduction in beta-amyloid could\nbe the reason for the affect of the apple juice on the mice.\nThe lead researcher, Dr. Shea, commented that the results \u201csuggest that\nregular consumption of apple juice\ncan not only help to keep one\u2019s mind\nfunctioning at its best, but may also be\nable to delay key aspects of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and augment therapeutic\napproaches.\u201d\nIn the past, scientists have shown\nthat apple juice may protect against\nother diseases related to aging including cancer, brittle bones, and heart\ndisease. A study last year also found a\nlink between apple juice and reduced\nwheezing in asthmatic children. These\nfindings add to the possibility that apple juice may be better for us than just\nfor the vitamin C content, and could\nbe used as a dietary supplement to\nenhance existing treatments for many\nconditions.\nApple juice and\nAlzheimer\u2019s\nA new study from the University of\nOxford has concluded that \u2018hospital\nat home\u2019 care programmes are just as\ngood as treatment in hospital. Such\nschemes could potentially reduce NHS\nmedical care costs, while increasing\nhospital bed availability and allowing\npatients to benefit from recovering at\nhome.\nThe programmes provide elderly\npatients who are critically stable with\nfull medical support at home, avoiding\nthe need for hospital admission. Such\nschemes have proved popular with pa-tients, their families and hospital staff\nand mortality rates now suggest that\nthere is no extra risk to patients treated\nat home. Dr Sasha Shepperd of the University of Oxford says the study \u201cfound\nno evidence that \u2018hospital at home\u2019\ncare leads to an increase in mortality\u201d.\nHowever, home care is advantageous\nbecause it can be provided for the same\nor lower cost.\nThe study gathered data from ten tri-als, involving over 1300 patients. Those\ninvolved had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, were recovering from\nstroke or were older patients with acute\nconditions.\nDr Shepperd cautions that these results do not mean hospital care is hazardous but that there are benefits to\ntreating patients at home. She believes\nthat more research must be done in or-dertoseewhowouldbenefitfromhome\ncare: \u201cMore work needs to be done to\ndetermine if there are particular types\nof patient who benefit from \u2018hospital at\nhome\u2019 care. This is especially important as the level of treatment available\nto a person at home, and the ways of\ndelivering care in both the home and\nthe hospital, change over time\u201d.\nHome treatment\ngood alternative to\nhospital admission\nMankind is not the only source responsible for greenhouse emissions and\nsome forms of air pollution: the planet\nitself is releasing methane, ethane and\npropane. A new study, published today\nin the journal Science, suggests that\nthis natural phenomenon plays a considerable role in the dynamics of the\natmosphere.\nIn the past, geologists at the Italian\nNational Institute for Geophysics and\nVolcanology (INGV) contributed to\nthe United Nation\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change with estimates on the amount of methane that\nnaturally leaks in to the atmosphere\nfrom underground compounds: 50\nmillion tons per year which, in terms of\ngreenhouse effects, is as much as 200\nmillion cars produce in one year.\nWhile methane is a greenhouse gas,\nmore harmful but less abundant than\ncarbon dioxide, ethane and propane\npose other concerns. Chemically combined with light and air, ethane and\npropane generate tropospheric ozone,\nwhich is poisonous if inhaled. This\nshould not be confused with stratospheric ozone, the gas that shields\nthe atmosphere from extraterrestrial\nultra-violet radiation.\nAccording to the new estimates, natural emissions represent around 17%\nand 10% respectively of the amount of\nethane and propane traceable in the\natmosphere.\n\u201cWe used to have better data on\nman-originated releases\u201d, explains\nINGV geologist Giuseppe Etiope, who\nauthored the study together with Paolo\nCiccioli from Italy\u2019s National Research\nCouncil (CNR). \u201cHowever, we cannot\nunderstand enough about greenhouse\ngases and global change if we ignore\nwhere one part of the released gases\ncomes from\u201d.\nAn updated global map shows that\nseepage spots are mainly distributed on\nthe Northern hemisphere, by oil compounds and geothermic areas. \u201cExperts\nalways considered such sources as\nmarginal and negligible.
