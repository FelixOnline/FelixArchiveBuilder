    "content": "Fi y x Operatic Society: The Mikado\nTHEIR REST I BLE music of Arthur\nSullivan and the precocious libretto of\nW.S. Gilbert rose to grand heights last\nSaturday when the Operatic Society performed \"The Mikado\". What a stunner of a production! In truly theatrical last-night\ntradition, the ad-lib s and encores were\nrife with marvellous effect. Imagine cheering for an encore of the Mikado's song and\nreceiving a superbly \u00abpoof version which\nsurprised not only the audience, but the\norchestra (who understandably muffed a few notes at the time) and the conductor\nas well to whom some of the lyrics were\njokingly directed:\n\"The imperfect conductor whom anyone\ncatches, unable to keep strict time,\nHe's made to stand with a second - rate\nband, conducting this tedious rhyme.\nThis bar barons bunch of part-time play-ers, to watching the beat they're\nimmune.\nHow can he get better at light operetta,\nwhen the violins can't play in tune?\"\n(These lyrics, incidentally, were written\nonly five minutes before they were sung\non stage) .\nAs Yum-Yum, Pat Elliot clearly starred,\nHer voice was clear and brilliant without\nbeing shrill. Lin Davis was magnificent\nas the Mikado, his presence on the stage\nbeing felt immediately. His outrageous encore brought the house down. Brian Parsons as Nan ki Poo and Peter Mills as Ko Ko shone confidently with Tim Johnson\n(Pish-Tush) and Sue Cochran (Katisha) in\nfine support. Roger Woodward as PoohBah was a neat piece of casting. The\nsubtle pathos injected into this role had\nthe audience in fits of laughter.\nMention must also be made of Debbie\nKemp (Pitt -Sing) and Jane Stanford\n(Peep-Bo), who, when they teamed up\nwith Pat Elliot for \"Three Little Maids\",\nshowed us what vocal training is all about.\nProducer Ian Gledhi II conductor David\nPollard and Op soc Chairman Steve Thurlow are entitled to be well pleased with\nthis year's production.\nfi as cr Js Ian Morse Ben Webster: Ballads by Ben Webster\n(Verve 2683.049)\nTo a few great jazz musicians, the\nadvance of years signifies a deepening of\ntheir powers. Stan Getz is one of these,\nso is Stephane Grappelli and supremely\nperhaps, was the late Ben Webster. He seems to have had two careers, the first\ncentered upon his time with the Ellington band in the 1940's and the second as a soloist from the mid-fifties onwards. The\ntunes compiled for this double- album are,\nas the title signifies all ballads (the field\nof jazz where one feels Webster was al ways most suited) taken from this second\nperiod\nThe sound of Webster's saxophone -the quality of tone, depth of im provisional skills but above all, his great romantic-ism, gives his ballad style a uniqueness\nthat shone through on almost ever thing he\ndid .Some of the best examples are to be\nfound on this record, among them, 'My\nfunny Valentine' 'Chelsea Bridge' and\n'Prelude to a kiss.' A fine album for\npeople who appreciate jazz, in particular\nBen Webster's approach to it. Hie\nA Foot in Cold Water: Or All Around\nUs. (Elektra).\nAn enterprising fellow indeed must \u2022\nhave conjured up this stylish name, I mean Canadians might have thought twice\nabout a band called\" Deep Uriah Sab\u00bb\nbath\", or something.\nThe opener's a mini - killer, a sort of\n\"Honky-Tonk Women\" a la Burlesque,\nentitled\"/ know what you need.\" The striking feature is that for a relatively\nnew outfit the sound is tight, and the\nproduction suits their loud, brash style\nThe playing is good, and obviously\ngoes back a fair way, but the vocals\nstamp a heavy metal seal on the music,\nto its detriment, as Alex Machin screeches\nout the lyrics allowing little scope for\ncontrast or variety, and after a few tracks\nthe monotony begins to set in. Of the group the most talented appears\nto be guitarist Paul Naumann, who\nprovides the more inventive moments to\nthis competently played and self penned set of numbers. The others seem to be\nembedded in a format of turning out\nrepetitive lyrics to a barrage of music to bash - your head against - the-floorboards\n-to.\nTo be fair though, the music is inter-e sting, and this album, with the right\nexposure, could do well with followers of\nUriah Heep or Black Sabbath. It is loud\nand heavy, and it kicks: so it is worth a listen. Not the stuff of legend, but in the\nabsence of Mr Machin they could well put\nout something special. Paul Ek pen yong Oscar Peterson, Lionel Hampton,\nBuddy Rich and Ray Brown: The Jazz\nAmbassadors (verve).\nAS YOU would expect from the title the\nmusicians on this album would be of the\nhighest calibre. Certainly Lionel Hampton\n(vibraphones), Oscare Peterson (piano),\nRay Brown (bass) and Briddy Rich( drums)\nare geniuses in each of their fields.\nThe music on this album was recorded\non three separate occasions between September 1953 and September 1954 and though\nthe recording is in mono this does not detract from the music.\nThe album kicks off with 'This can't be\nlove' with an easy going swing beat to it\nand there follows 'Midnight Sun' which is similar in style.' Love for sale' and\n'Stompin' at the Savoy' side two are superb\npieces. In the former Ray Brown performs a bass\nsolo of exquisite ness while in the latter we\nare treated to a sample of the amazing talents of Lionel Hampton on vibes. The next song 'Stardust' is of a slower\ntempo with piano dominating . This song\nreally marks the quality of music which Is hall leave you to discover for yourselves.\nThe second record (it's a two record set)\nbegins with 'Just one of those things' with\nthe crisp, im.mac u late drumming of Buddy\nRich, a classic piece. 'April in Paris' is something you've just got to experience.\nAgain as indeed throughout the album Lio nel Hampton's playing (this time on xy lop hone^ has to be admired and in fact he is the dominating influence throughout.\nIf you area jazz fan and enjoy the kind\nof music these guys play, then this album\nhas just got to be your next purchase.\nJohn Shore Richie Havens: Mixed Bay\n(Polydor 2310 356)\nIN keeping with his previous albums\nthis album contains mainly tracks written\nby other artists .In this case there is a wider variety, ranging from Paul McCartneys \"Band On the Run\" to Neil Young's \"The Loner\" and Bob Dylan s \"Sad Eyed\nLady\" to Wandering Angus\" a poem by\nYeats set to music. This does not imply\nthat he tries to copy other people, the reverse is definitely true - Havens is unique . His incredible voice is so deep that at\ntimes he sounds more like an url d grizzly\ngrowling .Unfortunately his instrumental\nability lacks the uniqueness of his vocals\nand he has to rely on a competent band of\nmusicians to drown out his repetitive\nstrumming .\nRichie Havens has a very positive\nphilosophy on life yet chooses not to ex-p press his thoughts to any great length in\nsong, indeed he wrote only one of the\ntracks on the album. The first track \"Ooh\nChild\" by Stan Vincent is very much in\nkeeping with his philosophy this the story\nof a father telling his son of the brighter\ndays ahead, in which Richie s' deep voice can be heard at its most melodic. The only\ntrack in which he does express himself is \"Someone Suite\" aptly named as it tells\nus we all must have some one to turn to. It makes me wonder why he has to rely on\nother people's work when he can write\nsuch meaningful words himself. \"Band on\nContinued on page 11\n\n"

    "content": "2 FELIX Michael Willi FREEDOM OF SPEECH is an ideal\nconcept which, historically, has already\nbeen impaired: censorship, the law of\nlibel and D notices on the press are all mechanisms designed to give.protection\nto society, the individual and the government respectively. Protection against\nwhat? Against ob ceni ties& crudities,\ndefamatory untruths and information that\nmight breach national security .\nIt has been suggested that one's freedom of speech should be impaired\nfurther in order to protect a small min -or it y, the overseas students within IC(e*, extending it to a national level, the\nUK' s immigrant population) from repress ion and intimidation by yet another\nsmall minority. But before endorsing or\nrejecting such a suggestion out of hand,\nthree, criteria can be considered.\nIf the racist elements grow stronger,\nwill violence become inherent in their\npolicies? One side will say no, never.\nThe other will argue historically, this\nis hound to happen . No conclusions\ncan be drawn .Should people be allowed\nto make up their won minds? One side\nwill say yes, let's have free debate.\nDon't make up people's minds for them.\nThe other side will say the racists are\ngiving people the \"soft sell\"; wait for\ntoo long and the situation will become\nexplosive. Again, two points of view.\nHow can the vast majority of students\nhere make up their mind?\nThe third and final question is this:\nDo the overseas students in this college feel oppressed, intimidated, be litt led or de moral is ed by the racist propaganda? There can be only one answer to\nthis. It is the answer which hammers the\nscales of the ultimately decisive crit er ion: If a minority of students in this\ncollege is being made to feel that they\nare unwelcome, then something must be\ndone about it. At the beginning of the\nsession,overseas students are given a generous welcome by the college. Is the\nsituation every going to arise where this\ncould be construed as hypocrisy?\nMay hell take the day when overseas\nstudents feel that they would be unwelcome at IC.\nAt the moment it is not the Left nor\nthe Right but the overseas students who\nare the losers. If the College does not\ntake an altitude on racism quickly, it\ntoo could find itself among the losers\nwhen its in ler national ties begin to decay .\nCity and Guilds Union\n14th February 1975\nDear Sir,\nIt was with great disgust\nthat I read your editorial in the\nlast edition of FELIX( no.378).\nI refer, of course, to your rum-our mongering section concerning the forthcoming elections.

The author,\nwho died in 1964 at the early age of\nthirty-eight, was a woman who spent\nmost of her life in Georgia, and this\nbook is a collection of short stories\nabout the people who inhabit the Deep\nSouth of America. She speaks with the\nquiet authority of one who has absorbed\nthe quintessential aspects of her unique\nenvironment; and in th se nine apo logue s she has successfully combined a considerable talent for writing with an obvious, probably inherent,flair for psycho-logy. Often an element of humour creeps\ninto the stories, particularly in her des-cri pt ions, but in no way are these used\nto gloss over the hard facts; the society\nshe describes is not an easy one to live\nin. Many of the people are failures,\nwhile in some cases the more worldly\nsuccessful figures are shown to be both\nshallow and un for giv ably complacent.\nThe only other American writer I know\nof who can portray this particular spec ies of working people with such perspicuity and honest accurateness is John\nSteinbeck, especially in The Grapes of\nWrath; anyone who enjoys his work will find much of interest here.Whether Mis sO 'Connor would have matured into as\ngreat a writer as he is a py hoth etc al, though interesting question. There isn't much of her work about, and she won't be writing any more, so get hold of a copy and read it before she either drops\ninto obscurity or acquires a cult follow-ing. CROSS COUNTRY\nThere was a distinct sense of deja vue last Wednesday when\nthe 4th London Colleges League race was held at Parliament Hill Fields only four days after the Southern Championships had been\nheld there. Had we really gone home that Saturday night after the\nchampionships or had we been running around through the mud\ncontinuously during the intervening period? I'm not sure,\nbut the terrain certainly seem\ned quite familiar.\nTo add insult to injury the\nelements decided the course\nwasn't muddy enough and five\nminutes before the start the\nheavens opened and produced\na downpour.\nIan F. ll is made his usual\nsprint for the front at the\nstart of the race, followed by\nthe usual progressive fade,\nbut kept going a little longer\nAfter our enforced midweek lay off the hockey club returned to\nthe fray last Saturday with a league match against Kodak. The\nday started in fine style for IC when skipper Tim(a stitch in\ntime) Hanson won the toss and after a great deal of thought elected to play towards the end which sported all the surface water.\nAs usual, IC attacked straight\nfrom the bully off, but most of\nthe attacks broke down due to\nthe varying pace of the ball\nthrough the wet patches.on the\npitch. Although IC left huge\ngaps in midfield the defence\ncoped admirably with any\nattack Kodak could offer. However, with only five minutes to\ngo to half time slack marking\nallowed a Kodak forward a bit\nof space and he promptly slammed the ball into the goal.\nHalf time arrived with Kodak\nleading 1 - 0. Inspired by our\ndynamic captain's half time\ntalk and also by the fact that\nthe forwards were attacking the\ndrier end of the pitch IC started\nthe second half in fine style.\nWith both defence and midfield\nunder total control the forwards\nlooked much more menacing and\ngoals seemed sure to come.\nThe first came from a right\nwing cross which beat the\nwhole Kodak defence . A brilliant run from left wing John\nLatter put him in the right spot\nand he only had to tap the ball home. A second goal soon fol-lowed. The events leading up\nto this goal were a bit confused .However after a lew minutes argument \" Sleepy\" Bas har awarded a penalty flick. As the Kodak goalkeeper dived out\nof the way Kim Houlden flicked\nthe ball over t him into the goal.\nOur third goal came when, on\nintercepting a hurried Kodak\nclearance, \" Julie\" put \" Hotshot\" Lord away down the right\nwing. The resulting cross was\ndrilled into the goal by a diving Bob Middleton. This goal\nwas a just reward for Bob whose tremendous efforts had done\nmuch in bringing about IC's second half revival (watch out\nMister Ta squared). Although\nKodak did score again before\nthe end IC deservedly won 3 -2. This was an excellent over-all team performance with noone playing a bad game .\nTeam:- Roger Hutson; Jim Marshall; Mike Vieyra; PJ 'Ace;\nWelsh Wizard; Stitch (capt);\nHotshot, Julie; Bob Middleton;,\nIan McLean; John Latter;\nUmp:- Sleepy\nthis time and wasn't passed by Rob or Steve until after a mile and a half. Rob All in son feeling good after his rest in\nthe Southern's boy's race <\npowered through to finish a very respectable 4th in 29.36,\nfollowed by Steve Webb in 13\nth place in 30.36. This rather\nearly arrival by Steve caused\nex-crosscountry club drinking\n(?) star Ian Isherwood to drop\nthe discs he was handing out\nto the finishers, Paul Clarke gave lan F. lli s a tun. for his money but Ian just about\ncame out on top finishing 20th( he might get his name in A.W. this time) with Paul two\nplaces behind, with times of\n31.06 and 31.13 \u2022 respectively.\nThe big surprise of the day\nthen occured when Dave Houlbrooke closed the scoring for\nthe l st team, obviously having overcome, the drive shaft\ntrouble that had caused his premature exit from the Southe ms. He ploughed in respectable 30th in 31.55. Dave\nJones was the space r at 39.\n2nd team: A If Garnett 47th; N. Boag 14th;R Harrington\n60th;I) J'ayne74 th; M. W'elford78 th.3 rd team: A.

With a full l st team in\nthe last league race we shou-ld beat them quite easily and\nalso hold off the expected\nlate challenge from Borough\nRoad College to win the l st division for the first time in\nat least 5 years (thats as long\nas I can remember!)\nThe 2nd team and the 3rd team are l st and 2nd in Division 2 and look certain candidates for promotion - we\nonly hope that they don't get\nrelegated next year!\nOn Saturday we competed\nin a race that has now become\na regular fix for the club. London' s\" Champion of champ ions\" road race, the Hill ing don ' 5 ' . It's a pity that the\nchanging facilities do not\nmatch up to the standard of\nthe race - 200 athletes all trying to use two loos before the\nrace and two tin baths after\nthe race is just not on! However the race is of sufficient\nquality to make up for the\nlack of facilities to a certain\nextent,\nThe course is one lap of5 miles around the roads of Hill ing don and Ruislip, spec-i ally constructed to frustrate\nmotorists and Saturday afternoon shoppers . Bob Holt of\nHercules Wimbledon led the\nfield home in a time of 23.45\nin front of a bunch of runners\nthat included Paul Clarke' s sprinting partner Julian Goater of Oxford. Apparently there\nwas a bit of a bundle up the\nfront and Julian Goater came\noff worst but unfortunately\nthe author was not up with\nleaders at that point and so\nno further information is ava-il able. Rob All in son led the IC team in( again) with a great\nrun of25.39 finishing in 34th place. Next was Steve Webb\nin 63rd eventually beating his30 minute bogey with.a time\nof 27.01. Paul Clarke was 80\nth in 27.39 and Dave Jones,\nreaching peak form just in\ntime for the Hyde Park Relay,\nfinished the scoring for the\nl st team in 90th position in a time of28.04. The captain,\nsuffering from a heavy cold didn't make the l st team (un-lucky Ian) but finished a96 th in a respectable time of 28.22.\nTwo other IC runners managed\nto break the six minute mi ling barrier, namely Alf Gamett\n121st,29.29 and Rich Harrington 130th in 29 SI. Amone\nthe also ran s were Neil Boa g139 in 39.16, Dave Hou l brooke, having tractor trouble\nagain, 145 in 30.47, John\nShearer 157 31.39 and Bob Ignaciuk 183 3 5 . 5 2 .

In other words if ever there were a group of\npeople who felt they were destined to rule and yet frustrated - it was Nietzsche' s stratum of German society.\nThis is where his ideas of\nMan and Superman come from.\nLife to Nietzsche is\" essentially appropriation, infringe-ment, the overpowering of the\nalien and the weaker, opp res sion, hardness, imposition of\none's own form, assimilation\nand, at the least and the mild-est, exploitation .\"\nHis ideas on humanity\neasily adapt to Hitler' s Aryan\ncreed \"At the bottom of all\nn able races lies unmistakably\nthe beast of prey, the magnificent blond beast, greedily\nprowling after prey and victory ''.\nThis outlook put him in\nopposition to Bismarck who\nhe criticized not for military\nexcesses but for his craven\nservility to the Emperor: \" /\nshall forgive no one who .\nmakes a compromise with it\"\nand \"Listen to the barking\ncommands that virtually encircle the German city\".\nNietzsche' s views on rac-i al mixing were easily ignored\nby the fanatical anti-communists of the Nar is who found\ntheir politics mirrored in his\nhatred of socialism and soc;ial Democracy .\nThus we see that Niet z sche brought to a high point al the fears and aspirations of the middle class in Germany\nwho were to form the backbone of Hitler' s movement\nsome sixty years later and\nthat is why his works were\nmade obligatory reading by\nthe National Socialists. Today his philosophy is mirrored in the poetic works\nof Enoch Powell\" I hate the\nweak, I hate the lame, etc .\"\nand tomorrow perhaps his\nworks will be appearing on\nthe bookshelf of the latest\nleader of middle class paranoia - Mrs Thatcher.\nHowever to take them into\npractice will be a different\nquestion compared to the\n1930's, Mr Pye.

    "content": "6 FELIX\n: Brendan Clements\nby Ri zSh a kir THE UNION Bar's Manager is a one can have an enjoyable chat\nto be appreciated.\nBrendan was bom in Dublin\nwhere he spent his youth and took his A levels. After working in the customs and excise for nine months, he left for\nLondon. He worked in a pub for two weeks after which he got a job\nin the Union Bar while looking\nfor something else. However,\nhe stayed on and was subsequently offered the job of\nrunning toe bar, which he accepted. Now he likes the\njob, the people he works with, and he says \"after working\nhere for six and a half years,\nIt has become part of my life\".\nI asked him what did Ms job entail; the answer came,\n\"/ work bloody hard for a start -Oft and feel that part of my job\nIs to make the bar as good a place to come to as possible\nbesides the usual buying and\nselling etc. It is not a nine -to-five job (although the basic\nweek fs forty hours) because\nn amicable character with whom\nor exchange a joke which is sure\npart of the job is to cover for\npeople If they are sick. If I have to work sixty hours, then\nI have to work sixty hours;\nthere is no way of getting out\nof it\".\nHe enjoys going to dinners\nbecause \"It gives me a chance\nto meet people and see the\nother side of a person\". Then\nhe jokingly adds \"and it's a lot cheaper than going outside\".\nHe admits that a student\nenvironment must have some\neffects on married life but in the\nsame breath he adds that none\nof these are in any way adverse.\nThe only snag of the job is the\nlong hours that he has to work\nbut he thinks that this could\nhappen in any trade.\nUpon my inquiry about the\nway in which the bar has\nchanged over the years, he\nreplied that the bar used to be\n\"cliquish\", whereas now\nvarious colleges organise bar\nnights etc and it allows students\nto meet other students with\nsimilar interests. He believes\nthat the Union Bar is unique in\nso far as \"everybody seems to\nknow the next person\".\nSomewhat reluctantly he\nagrees that there are some\nfrustrations in his job which he\nhas to put up with, \"for\nexample, there are times when\nI would have liked to have\ncommented on something, but I am a College employee\". He quickly supplements the above\nstatement with \"but it is not\nmy job to say such things,\npeople are elected to do this\nand in any case people have\nstarted to consult me over most\nof the relevant decisions taken\nin recent years\".\nHis big interest is rugby\nwhich came about as a direct\nresult of working In' the bar. Before coming to IC he played\nGaelic Football and basketball\nbut now he does not get the\ntime to take an active interest,\nalthough he does say \"I'm a fairly good spectator of any\ngame\".\nHe follows the progress of\nIrish Rugby with particular\ninterest because \"it i& the only\ninternational sport in-w l fl ch the\nteam is chosen from both the\nNorth and the South . I like to\nsee them do well for that reason.\nLife in Mines\nBob Fiona Ruminating in the balmy atmosphere of the Mines common room,\nsurrounded by sen net paper aeroplanes and congealed chocolate,\nthe assembled in tell i gen cia is w racking its brain for ideas for\nthis article when in walks Superminer. Going straight to the head\nof the queue for the coffee machine, he turns and says: \"Anyone\ngot t up pence to lend us?\" Yes folks, its * ? !\nscrounge again!\nG) on the\nExpectancy\nWhat has this got to do with\nan article for FELIX? Ab sol ut ely nothing, but it does typify\nlife in RSM at the moment. The low ebb of morale encountered\nat the beginning of term is now\nalmost back to its most buoyant high, and there is a tremendous air of expectancy surrounding all.( No, super miner is not\npregnant!)\nBrighton or Calais?\nThe Union elections are to\nbe held next month, and apart\nfrom deciding on suitable candidates for the posts, there is a lively discussion on whether\nor not we should risk going\ndown to Brighton again after\nthe infamous dealings we had\nlast year with the High Sheriff\nof Sussex. The only other alternative seems to be a trip\nover to Calais to give le fuzz\nFrancais a headache for a change, though it seems likely\nthat Brighton will remain the\nvenue. Davey bearers tried\nThe trial of Helen Mattrass,\nMike Kilbride and the other\nDavey bearers has now taken\nplace, and as usual in these\ntrials, which are extremely fair\nand unbiased (the accused are\neven allowed counsel for their\ndefence!), the possible verdicts\nranged from not very guilty through guilty and very guilty to\nextremely guilty, though only\nthe latter came seriously into\nconsideration. The Judge, (The\nRight Honourable Lord Mortimer) was in a lenient mood how-ever, and the penalties awarded were not too severe .\nWhitewash\nYou may have noticed that\nthe Mines building has been\ngiven a good WB U and is now\nonce again looking the regally\nsuperb monument it is. It really\nis amazing what a bit of soap\nand water can do .(About that\ndenim suit Mash..) Drummer fooled\nEnthusiasm (something C&G and RCS only read about), is In great abundance in Mines as can be noted by comparing the\n176 at the Engineers D&D( with Minesmen and OC's outnumbering present Guildsmen)\nto the 328 at the Mines Ball. We were glad to hear, however,\nthat the drummer of the band\nbooked for the D&D eventually arrived at College Block after making a tour of Knights bridge, (courtesy of Supenminer.)\nRockdrill rhythms\nAnd now something about\nminers . A miner has a natural\nadvantage over others doing\nmore conventional courses - he\nknows he can readily get a job\n(and more often than not, a well paid one!) on leaving the\nthe cloistered confines of university. Once you have got your\njob, you also have the perk of\nfree me a is underground (if you\nare fast enough to catch the\nrats and you do not mind big, juicy cockroaches), though you\nhave to get your own steak for\na Saturday morning bra a i. Also, for between \u00a310 and \u00a325 per\nmonth if you are working in the\nright part of the world, you get\nfull board and lodging. On top\nof this, if you train them well\nenough the laundry girls will not use a hot iron to melt your\nnew nylon shirts, and might\neven give you some of your own\nclothes back if you are lucky.. One of the major advantages of\nworking underground however,\nis that you can get away from\nnagging women for a while and\nsleep off your hangover to the\npeaceful rhythm of half a dozen\nrock drills banging away at the\nstop e face.\nCharacter\nAnyway, back to the RS M where life flows peacefully on,\nand the Union pays for you to\ngo abroad and get paralytic for\na week on a Foreign Students\ntrip .More emphasis was always\nla id .on character rather than\nacademic brilliance .Some of\nyou may even remember John\n\"Batman\" Mellors, at the moment taking a holiday of convenience from the rig ours of RS M. His latest exploit was to figure\nprominently in rescue operations in a flooded mine shaft in\nSouth Africa. Such is the RSM\nspirit. A bit of news for the more\nuninformed FELIX readers is,\nthat RSM again wiped the board\nwith Cambourne. Last weekend,\nthe bottle match was again\nfought and won, more convincingly than the score line suggests, and our footballers and\nsquash players yet again showed their sup re man cy over the\nmake - believe miners from\nCornwall . All in all, a great\nweekend well rounded off in\nthe bar!\nAnd now, to finish, a quote\nwell known to Minesmen and\nsome of Physics III: \"If this\nmachine gives water instead of\nchocolate, please fold the notice at the back of this notice\nover this notice.\" Long live RSM and all \u00bbv ho drink in her!\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX SPORT INTERNATIONALS ROWING A TIC During the past few months, anyone visiting the Putney Embankment on a Thursday morning as dawn breaks, will have seen 8\nstudents braving the elements and taking to the water as members\nof one of the most unusual boat clubs in Britain. Although unknown\nto probably 99% of IC students, there are no less than 6 full G.B.. internationals at IC, including\ntwo Olympic oarsmen. To these\ncan be added a Cambridge blue\nand until recently the B.U.S. F. COX LESS PAIR Gold medalists. Five of these oarsmen work for\nProfessor Cameron in the Lu bri cation Laboratory in Me ch.Eng. and with his encouragement got\ntogether with the rest and formed\nthe \"Lubrication Laboratory of\nImperial College. B.C.\" which\nwas registered with the A.R.A. this year. Due to commitments\nwith other clubs and the Nationa l Squad they cannot row together seriously but meet each Thursday morning for a short outing\non the Thames.\nwhat form the work was to take\nand it was only after turning along Wandsworth bridge that they\nwere picked up by the Cambridge\nlaunch and the work load ex-plaine d. The outing was to cons is t of a3 minute interval followed by 2 minutes rest, a6 minute row followed by 2 minutes\nrest and finally another 3 minute\nrow. The crews joined up below\nPutney Railway bridge and a20 stroke wan n up by each crew\nproved inconclusive . At Putney\nPier the first 3 minutes row began with Lab on Middlesex. Starting third of a length down\nthe Lab coped much better with\nHowever, last Sunday they\ncame together for a more specific reason, for over the weekend the Tideway was visited by\nthe Cambridge University Boat\nRace crew, themselves contain-ing four internationals, who have\nbeen rowing together daily for\nthe past few months and who\nwanted to get some experience\nin the Putney reach before their\nannual clash with Oxford in\nMarch. On Saturday they dispatched the Tideway Scullers with\nease. (The Scullers were, until\nthe recent formation of the National Squad, generally regarded\nas the National VIII.) On Sunday\nthey were to do some intervals\nwith \"Lub Lab\". Unfortunately\nthe Lab had three of the first\nchoice oarsmen indisposed and\nso had to boat three substitutes.\nDespite the fact that one of them\nwas Mike Hart (Bronze Medalist\nin the European Championships),\nthe crew was now completely\nscratch and in general gave\nthe msl eves little chance. Lea ving the Putney hard the crew had\nlittle idea of how much or of the disturbed water than did\nCambridge, who were thoroughly\nunsettled by its and at the end\nof the 3 minutes the Lab had esta blis he da lead of third of a length . The 6 minutes interval was\nrowed round the big Surrey bend\nwith Cambridge on the inside.\nAgain the Lab started down but\nthis time Cambridge, due to then\npractice together managed to\nmaintain a higher ra to and after\na clash of oars just below Hammersmith bridge, went clear and\nfinished 2 4 lenght s in the lead.\nThe final 3 minutes was rowed\noff the remaining parts of the\nSurry bend and up to Barnes\nbridge. Cambridge again had the\nbetter starts but the Lab rallied and both crews finis shed the\npiece at 36, Cambridge Yi in the\nlead. The Lab's performance\nconsidering their three subs and\none outing a week, was extremely good. When the crews meet\nagain in a few weeks time with\nthe Lab at full strength I doubt\nif Cambridge will see which way\nthe Lab go. BOAT CLUB IC SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY CHAMPIONS On Saturday morning we arrived at Reading for the Southern Uni\nvers i ties Regatta to find the usual Reading conditions:- mud, rain\nand more mud. The 1st VHI was entered in the Championship Eights division Our first race was against Oriel College Oxford and St.Edmund HE\nOxford . Despi te a shaky start\n(someone forgot to take the\nfirst stroke) we quickly pulled\nahead of both crews . We then\nsat three lengths in front of\nSt. Edmund Hal! for the rest\nof the race. Oriel were two or\nthree lengths behind St. Edmund Hall. Our next race was\nagainst 1st and 3rd Trinity,\nCambridge who had previously\nbeaten Southampton. Since our\ntime in the first round was\nover twenty seconds faster\nthan theirs we were a bit over\nconfident and as a result our\nrowing was not exactly brilliant, but we still came in six lengths (24 sees) in front.\nThe final was against Clare College, Cambridge. This was\nour best row of the day in which we pulled ahead of Clare fairly soon after the\nstart and were three lengths\nup by the finish. We were presented with the Harp Lager\nTrophy and individual pewter\npint tankards after the end of the regatta. A good start to\nwhat we hope to be a succ-ess ful season. The 2nd VIII were entered\nin the Second Eights division. Unfortunately they were beat-Hall en by Kings College Cambridge and Pembroke College Oxford in the first round. However I should point out that\nboth these crews were 1st VIIIs so what they were doing\nin a2nd VIIIs event I am not\nquite sure.\nThe Novice VIII (Lublab)\nwon their first round in the\nNovice division against\nChelsea College and Southampton quite easily and in a similar fashion beat Reading\nin the second round. However\nthey.lost to 1st and 3rd Trinity Cambridge in a fast final. This crew is not going to stay\nnovice for long. The crews were:-l st VIII Bow, W. White; J Fitzgerald; M. Jones; P. JLangguth; D.

    "content": "4\nMU XP REC3 PUCE Trevor Phillips NEXT WEEK is designated the\nWeek of Action. Elsewhere in this\nFELIX what we plan is outlined. I hope that we can ensure a large turnout on Tuesday and Friday. This is\ncrucial point in the campaign. It is\nabout now that the DES will be in its\ndiscussions with the Treasury over\nthe amount of money that it gets for\nthe next year, particularly in respect\nof the money needed to abolish the\nanomalies in the grant system.\nThere are those who say that this\nkind of action achieves very little.\nHowever, some of us remember the\ncampaign on Union Autonomy of 1971-72, which caused Mrs Thatcher, then\nSecretary of State for Education, to\nwithdraw her proposals for political\ncontrol of Student Unions. It was\nthose \"pointless demos\" which showed her the depth of feeling amongst\nstudents (we had almost 1000 from\nIC alone), and caused her capitulation\n- by her own ad miss sion( see last\nweek's Sunday papers).\nThere are those who say ^hat demos\nalienate public op'n 'on. This is a comment usually made by those who have\nnever been on one. In my own experience,\n(and that includes a large number of dem-os) public reaction on the route of a student march is in general sympathetic or\nindifferent. There is occasional hostility,\nbut my own reaction has usually been to\ntry to explain the purpose of the demonstration to the person - and often with\nsome success. This is the way we bring\nhome to the public the situation on both\ngrants and education. In terms of the education cuts, I know tat parents will be\nbehind students. The cuts made by Local Education Authorities in primary and secondary schooling have caused near-riots\namongst parents in, for example, Buckinghamshire( well-known centre o' militancy!)\nThis is the way that students will\nachieve the change in the grants system - and call for a fair deal for e duc ation.\nWe are already seeing the effect of the\nDES policy for next year. The Governing\nBody will today be asked to approve further cuts across the board in 1975-76,\nprobably followed by \" selective cuts\". Where will those selective cuts fall? The\nchoice is either further deterioration of\nacademic facilities, or cuts in ancillary\nservices - libraries, etc. It is more than\nlikely that, unless we are able to transfer\nto direct financing by the LEA's that the\nUnion will be hit. That means cuts to\nclubs and societies, and a consequent restriction of student activities in, for\nexample, sports.\nWe faced this problem three years\nago in an attach on Union Autonomy .\nWe face it again - but only with the\ncommitment and support of students\nthemselves.\n*\nTHE GRANTS / CUTS CAMPAIGN\nMRS. T.I see that the race is on for next year's Union Officers. Traditionally, the \" top three\" (Pres, Dep. Pres, and Hon Sec.)\ntake no stand in favour of any candidate.\nHowever, I am willing to give an opinion,\nin private, for a small sum. Any takers,\nfor the backing of my massive influence?\nBy the way it's good to see that there are\nso many candidates for the Amorary\nSecretary, at least. Congratulations to our Governor, Mrs .\nThatcher, on her election as Opposition\nleader. I hope and expect that she will have a long and distinguished career in\nthat capacity. Those of you who doubted\nme when I forecast this in October, 1974,\nmay apologies e by post. I did make a \u00a310\nbet on her in October, but the other person claims that he can't remember it!\nHow did I make the prediction?\nThe political reasoning is simple.\nThe Tories selected Thatcher and not\nWhitelaw because they know that the\nclass divisions are there - and they\nwill do their utmost to preserve them.\nHON S \u00a3C ELECTIONS, ELECTIONS, ELECTIONS!\nNobody seems to talk of anything else these days.\nBy the time you read this all the nomination papers\nshould be up, you might even have received your first\npiece of election bump h; that is if there is any opposition for any of the posts.\nThere are a lot of posts to be filled, but with over\n4,000 students there should be plenty of people interested enough to stand. When the voting takes place,\npeople are needed to man ballot boxes ( \u00a3 2 a session\nduring the two days of the election). More important,\npeople are needed to VOTE. All that you need to vote is your nomination card,\nand about five seconds. Surely it's worth it to register\nan opi onion and help elect someone.\nCORRECTIONS TO THE CORRECTIONS IN\nTHE UNION DIRECTORY\nOVERSEAS STUDENTS' COMMITTEE\nNOTICE BOARD\nA part of the notice-board in the J. C.R. has been\ngiven to the Overseas Students Committee. Overseas\nStudents are asked to look at this notice-board for\nnotices concerning events organised by the Union\nCommittee, the Kensington Committee or the British\nCouncil, and notices on other matters relevant to\nthem.\nThe notice-board may also be used by National\nSocieties, specially to advertise events of a more\ngeneral interest.\nR.C.

While some students find the publication very useful,\nothers are totally against it. A very interesting suggestion comes from Richard Upton ( ln T.d us trial Sociology Unit, PG) mentioned the possibility of producing an IC Union plastic cover for registration card, NUS card and\nan IC Union information card .\nWhat are your view?

Five hundred\nstudent places handled by the\nPoly' s accommodation office\ncould now be in jeopardy. The move not only affects Trent\nPoly but also Nottingham University and Notts. College of\nEducation. A meeting at the Poly on\nTuesday 11th February, which\nwas attended by 400 students\nrejected the landlords' statement and arbitration, which\nwas suggested by the Poly Authorities. In addition to the\nlocal demo next Wednesday, the\nUnions are advising students\nof their legal rights against\neviction etc. The possibility of a picket is also under discussion. In addition to this,\nthe legality of the landlords'\naction will also be investigated. HAVING EXECUTED one of the most daring mascot ry raids in recent years, the City and Guilds Union have now\ncome into the possession of 'Phineas', a6 foot painted\nplaster statue of a Scotsman, who is the mascot of University College London.\nThe mascot was in a switchboard room underneath the\nCollegiate Theatre, Gordon\nSt. It was lying in a pit, 3 ' 6 \"\ndeep, covered with boards and\nchained with a heavy duty\nelectrical cable. The raid took place at 10\npm last Tuesday night when a transit van and four cars arrived at the theatre. An advance group ' A', consisting of five people, armed with bolt\ncutters and electrical gear cut\nthe main gate open and reached the switchboard room via a basement tunnel. Whilst this\nwas going on, an opera was\nbeing performed on the very\nstage that the mascot was\nunder.\nThe group cut the mascot's chains and raised it vertically\nin the pit. They then called up group ' B' by radio - tele-phone. Group ' B'( thir tee en people) reached the location\nat about 10.20 pm. At this\npoint the opera finished - to\nthe mascot e ers surprise.\nUndeterred by the thought\nof the crowds of people pouring out of the theatre posing\nthe threat that they be spotted\nwhen they tried to leave,\ngroup ' B'raised' Phineas' out\nof the pit and took it back\ndown the tunnel (which was\nonly three inches wider than\nthe mascot itself). They emerged from the basement, mingled with the crowds coming\nfrom the opera, loaded the\nmascot into the transit van and left. Meanwhile, group' A' replaced the boards over the\npit and left by the same route.\nClearly, this was a superb\neffort by Guilds to mark President Jenny Jones' birthday.\nBaby Demo !\nNEXT WEDNESDAY, February26 th, has been designated by NUSa s the day for a\" National Baby Demo\" Students though out the country will be bringing young children into\nlectures.\nNUS Vice President, Sue\nSlipman, in a letter to all NUS areas says \"We are taking up,\nas central to womens'demands,\nthe question of nursery facilities in light of education cutbacks . \" The purpose- of the\ndemo, is to highlight the need\nfor nursery facilities for stud-ents.

Restore the education cuts There are also a range of other aims including parity for overseas students, a better system of postgraduate demonstrating rates etc. The DES is shortly to put its plans for education to the Treasury. The results of these negotiations will determine the nature of the grants system after this year. It will also determine whether edu*cational standards are to continue falling, and whether the colleges will continue to teeter on the edge of bankruptcy. It is essential that students show their support for the claims of the campaign and do so now. Next year maybe too late.

These elections take place at the end of this\nterm.\nIt is very important that IF\nhas a strong union committee.\nOnly with a strong union committee can IF have any sort of\nsocial life. As a secretarial\ncollege we are more prone to\nslip into the sort of nine to\nfive routine that kills any (dare\nI say it) community spirit and\nthis in turn deadens any enthusiasm for the academic side\nof college. Discos, dances and\ndinners are not organised for\nthe sake of amusing a few\npeople for a few hours. Whether\nthey are a means of com muni c ation, a topic of conversation,\nsomething to be approved of or\nobjected to, the fact remains\nthat the organisation of it, the\nleading-up, the event itself and\nthe aftermath all create an interest which stimulate the daily\nlife of college.\nMoreover a strong union committee is vital in order to bridge\nthe communication gap which\nexists between the staff and the\nstudents at IF. Abuses cannot\nbe righted until they are brought\nto the attention of those con-cern ed. At IF the barrier tends\nto be more practical than psy-cho logical. Most students here\nhave a full timetable from 9.00\nam to 3.30 or 4.30 pm and they\njust do not have the opportunity\nto express their grievances,\nwhich is where the members of\nthe Union step in. They, incidentally, must possess a limitless a bulit y to make time.\nTime is very much an important factor when it comes to\nstanding for a union post. Each job demands more than its fair\nshare. Often, particularly in the\nposts of President and Social\nSec at IF, it is a question of\nJANICE FORD, a second year Chemical Engineer from Turbridge Wells,\nis a girl who thoroughly\nenjoys life - particularly at\nIC . She is a Beit Hall rep.\nthis year and is also on\nthe Chem. Eng .Soc . Committee. She has well proved\nher worth to Guilds as a Rag Collector, but together\nwith a charming smile, she\nis also proficient in judo -so gentlemen beware!\nCommenting on the soc*\ni al life at IC she said:-\"I suppose there will always be a lack of girls at\nIC but I enjoy myself\"\nI CW A J U1IA DUNNING it seems that ICWA is to be in the headlines for quite a while\nyet; something which can only be welcomed, always assuming that\nthe publicity is good. This, however, seems a little doubtful.\nHence, this article. ICWA for the length of time it's existed has been asec i al body,\nand one which I believe val u ably contributes to the social life of\nthe College. However, it far from\ncaters for everyone's tastes and\nand has always had, perhaps\nlust if y ably, a rather genteel,\naide world image.\nThese very facts have prompted a number of responsible, for-ward-thinking members of the Association to come to me to put\nor ward means of breathing new\nif e into ICWA .Throughout the\nn any discussions held in trie\npast few weeks, they have emphasised to me that they do wish to stay part of the Association, and that they are proposing an\nextension of it's present act iv i ties rather than a change of the\nalready existing ones.\nAfter much wrangling, I am\nnow prepared to act on their proposals and give my support to\nthe 'Women in Science' group.\nThis group has ( and I stress\nthis point ), evolved from a body\nof thought within the Associa tion, and as members have every\nright to propose any change, providing it does not harm the Association. It should not harm the\nsocial side of ICWA, as long as\nit continues to recognise that\nthis is a valuable part of it's existence . On the other hand, it\ncould do ICWA the world of good\nby stimulating a greater number\nof the women to take part and to\nactually do something positive\nto alleviate the problems, both\nsocial and academic, of the women in the College. It should\nalso be possible to make a significant contribution towards the\nAdmissions Policy on women,\nboth in making ah effort to encourage women into this college\nand a more general basis in trying to break down the barriers\ndiscouraging women from taking\nup science careers.\nFor those of you who wish do\nfind out more about the present\nsituation I have called a GENERAL MEETING, TO BEHELD ON TUESDAY, THE25 TH OF FEB. AT12.30 PM IN THE ICWA\nLOUNGE. The question of women in residence will also be brought up. Discuss sion on the election of\nnext year's committee and the\nestablishment of an \" additional\" post, that of Deputy President,\nwill also take place .\nchoosing between union work\nand studies, and usually it is\nthe first which wins because it\nis the most difficult to put off.\nMeetings have to be attended,\nletters have to be written,\nphone calls have to be answer-ed, pra cels have to be collected\nand unfortunately one can al ways obtain a few days' grace\nfor an essay. The most rewarding aspect\nof being on the Union is that\none is made aware - aware not\nonly of people, plans and pro-ble ms, but of petty politics as\nwell. Intrigue, scandal, inside\ninformation, oh it's all here1 Be in the know, be in the\nUnion!\nLikewise each job demands\na lot of thought. One must have\nthe ability to question policies passively accepted by others,\nand to see a future (be it only a short term basis) for the college\nas a whole, and to have the\nwi'll to influence this .Whether\none arouses favour or opposition is of little consequence:\nboth are signs of interest; the\nbig bugbear to be avoided at\nall costs is apathy. The elections at the end of the term are\na unique opportunity to leave\nthe ranks of the apathetic and\nto join the doers of this world.\nAlbert's Plum(S. Ken.S tn.)

A staff poll offered the choice of d is invest ing, harassing companies about\nSouth Africa, or doing north ing. The majority were for harass-ment, with one third of the staff\nvoting.

A spokesman at Durham\nStudents Union said that the\nUniversity was in effect ignoring a vote it had requested.\nTomorrow there will be a National Demonstration in Durham\nending in a rally at the University, which is to be attended by\nstudents from Universities throughout the country.

The committee is waiting for a report of the trading figures for January\nbefore making a firm recommendation to the Governing Body. As reported in the stop press of\nFELIX, issue no. 377, the\nincrease will be in the order\nof 12%.\nThis increase which would\nbe effective from April1 st wo-ul d help erase a deficit of approximately \u00a315,000, the latest estimate to date.

The\nThe Left wing group then\ndecided to enter lecture theatre\nA and hold their meeting although this had not been booked\nfor such a purpose. After a brief discussion between the\nBursar and the ICU President,\nhowever, the meeting did take\nplace.\nThe NF meeting claimed that their attendance was low because of the Bursar's directive and because some of their\nsupporters had shied away for\nfear of intimidation.\nThe Left' s meeting discus sed way of combating racial is m and fascism and made several\nproposals which included esta b li shing a regular broadsheet\nto present arguments against\nracial is m and fascism; in vi ting speakers such as Ian Mikado or Steve Parry to address\nfuture meetings; and one idea\nwas to organise a trip to see\nan anti-fascist play being performed on the South Bank \"Adventures of Jackboot\".\nNF meeting, which\nnumbered fourteen people ( including guest speakers), was held in lecture theatre B. There was a directive from\ndie Domestic Bursar that the\nmeeting should not be publicised and that people should be\nprivately invited to attend. Despite this directive, Left\nwing factions did manage to\ndetermine the time and location\nof the meeting and a peaceful\npicket was held at the door to\nthe meeting.\n9\nv/o ul d be a short fall of \u00a365,000.

One suggestion to help achieve\nthis would be to partition South\nside \" in such a way as to give\na series of three-sided \" bays\". On the second point it suggested that one of the refectories\nbe closed down and the room\nused for some other purpose.\nIt is perhaps regretful that\nin a paper of such importance\nthere is no stress laid on the\nabysmally low quality of food\nserved in the refectories.
