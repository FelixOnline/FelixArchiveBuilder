    "content": "10 Reviews\nCarter USM\nPost Historic Monsters\nIt seems strange that Carter were, and still are,\nregarded as indie jokers. They have employed\ndance beats and guitars to lyrics which have\nraised awareness in such areas as the reality of\nwar: 'G.I. Blues', 'Spoilsports Personality of the\nYear' and press coverage/manipulation to name\na few. So maybe they use the odd touch of irony,\nbut does that negate the exercise?\nAfter a pointless instrumental opener which\ncan only be excused by tradition, the album\nkicks in with the first stomp-a long. It redresses\nthe balance of things that would be cured by\nlove - \"If love is the answer / What was the\nquestion / And can it cure my indigestion /\nBaby?\" A more serious running thread is\nFascism, both overt and creeping. 'Stuff The\nJubilee' and 'Bachelor For Baden-Powell' show\nthe Bob and Bat in typical fashion.\nJesus and\nMary Chain\nSound of Speed\nThe opening line to the Chain's second album\nof B sides, EP fillers and covers is depressingly\nfamiliar: \"I 've got syphilitic he t ero friends in\nevery part of town ...\" You know that nothing's changed in their world of urban, suicidal\nbleakness.\nThis time we get 20 tracks for our money,\nsurely a bargain? There are old distortions in\nnew clothes; 'Reverence' and 'Young Lust'\nfrom 'Honey's Dead' and 'Sidewalking' from\n'Barbed Wire Kisses.' The various covers mix a heady brew from Elvis Presley's 'Guitarman' to\na mystical union with Leonard Cohen's 'Tower\nOf Song.' The line \"I ache in the places where I used to play,\" is so right it could have been\nwritten for them. Willie Dixon's 'Little Red\nRooster' has its entrails whipped out, and\nthere's even a stab at ' My Girl', in the best\npossible taste you understand.\nOf the originals, 'Snakedriver' is a razzle d head of the best vintage and 'Write Record\nRelease Blues' is as honest a statement as you\ncan get about a dirty business. The rest are a mixed bag but even so, as an album, the 'Sound\nof Speed' will be more compelling than most\nproper releases this year. Roll on their new\nacoustic album echoes the refrain, oh yes.\nTintin\nReleased on Blanco y Negro\nWhile these more serious issues of war and\nsuicide are examined, it seems that, in an\nattempt to get the message across, the music\nitself suffers. Maybe it's a deliberate ploy so that\nthe minimal music is forgotten and the lyrics are\nremembered; particularly on 'Suicide Isn't Painless' and the single 'Lean On Me I Won't Fall Over'. However, the melody returns on\n'Evil' becoming almost a Carter-if i ed nursery\nrhyme, and 'Sing Fat Lady Sing' which deals\nwith the 'nothing to say' bands and perhaps\nunfairly dismisses them with \"And send the next\njoker in when you're gone,\". Similar concepts\nappear on 'Lenny and Terence'.\nThe closing number is acoustic, 'Under The\nThumb And Over The Moon' which could be\nsubtitled 'The Impossible Dream part 2'. It\nshows that Carter have two sides, the serious\nand the humourous, and that while the two mix,\nthe serious issues should not be dismissed in the\nway in which they are presented.\nBratt Anderson\nReleased on Chrysalis\nThe Flaming\nLips\nTransmissions from the\nSatellite Heart\nThis album is a muddling home-built thing\nwhich looks pretty fragile with worn edges. It\nstill retains a freshness long vanished from\nmuch of the world. Yes, the Flaming Lips are\ngoing for the Spin Doctor's market in a more\nconvincing way than the originals.\nStarting with the radio friendly 'Turn It On',\nyou're broken in gently to their fractured world.\nIt may not be logical but it sure is more fun than\nmost people have this side of an MTV unplugged appearance. 'She Don't Use Jelly' is\na rambling nonsense song of epic proportions,\nvase line on toast not being generally considered\nas healthy eating. '******* (plastic jesus)'\ncocks a snoot at the superstitious equivalent of\nfurry dice. 'Moth In The Incubator' stumbles\ninto play with two speed options: slouch or\nhyperactive and what 'Pilot Can At The Queer\nOf God' is on about is anybody's business.\nReally by this stage no one can care.\nThe good-time folks are back in play, the\nsun is out and pixies live at the bottom of my\ngarden. Be adventurous, branch out. Get some\nnew friends, buy something you've never heard,\ntrust me. Honest. That's freedom.\nTintin\nReleased on Warner Bros.\nIll III m mm\nPower of\nDreams\nPositivity\nAnd so the Power of Dreams. Let's start happily.\nThe art work is good, well I'd wear the T shirt\nand that's money these days. On the musical\nfront things are rarely so bright, although the\nlads have an endearing approach, to be sure. It's a touching concern for the issues of life: broken\nfamilies, abused children, ecological worry,\nrich-eat-poor anger. This is all worthy stuff, but\nwhere REM would spring a bitter lyric or the\nVega/Amos' of the world twist it in your face,\nPoD just carefully observe and note.\nStill there are some gems on offer, albeit of\nthe semi-precious variety. The single 'See You',\n'Song For Nobody' and 'Falling From The Sky'\nare unpretentious and pleasant, but it's not really\nenough to save the album.\nStrangely the five live tracks are the most\ninteresting, despite the subdued politeness of the\nJapanese audience. 'It's A Shame' is ominously\ndelicious as a finale but it leaves you rather\ndisappointed about what has gone before.\nTintin\nReleased on Lemon Records\nThe Milltown\nBrothers\nValve\nThere is something peculiar about bands who\nattempt cover versions of extremely famous\nsongs, especially when they are released as\nsingles. Enter The Milltowns with a goofy grin,\nclutching Dylan's 'It's All Over Now Baby\nBlue.' The most damaging thing is that over the\nwhole album 'Baby Blue' is one of the better\ntracks. Certainly it displays the lyrical weakness\nof most of the other pickings on offer; it is not\nrepetitive and is vaguely understandable (in a surreal way).\nThe Milltown's other peccadillo of note is an\nobsession with hammond organ sound. Normally\na cool, bluesy thing, here it is used to\ndistraction. The one light in this dark world is\n'Turn Off, the only track produced by Gil Norton (Pixies). Here at least the energy of the\nstaccato ed intro manages to infuse throughout\nthe whole before the hammond organ wheezes\ninto play. As for the rest, it's a bit tortured.\nTintin\nReleased on A&M Meet the sabbaticals on page 30\n\n"

    "content": "2 News\nWaldegrave's Higgs Boson\nBY ANDREW TSENG\nProfessor of Theoretical Physics,\nTom Kibble, is one of the winners\nof the 'Higgs boson' competition.\nTom Kibble, is the 'forgotten half\nof the two man team who proposed\nthe existence of the Higgs boson.\nMr Waldegrave set the\ncompetition at the Institute of\nPhysics Annual Congress in\nBrighton last April (see Felix 964).\nIn a call for better understanding of\nscience, he told reporters that he\nwould give a bottle of vintage\nchampagne to anyone who could\ntell him what the Higgs boson is,\nand why they want to find it.\nEntries had to be in layman's terms\nand be submitted on a single side of\nA4 paper.\nAfter reading 117 entries, Mr Waldegrave selected five winners\nwith the help of Professor Michael\nBerry of Bristol University, who\nchecked them for scientific\ncorrectness.\nCongratulating the winners, Mr\nWaldegrave said, \"I was delighted\nwith all the entries to the Higgs\nboson competition. They were of\nsuch high quality that we have\nchosen five winners instead of just\none. My congratulations to all of\nthem, even if it has cost me five\nbottles of champagne instead of\none!\"\nOf the five winning entries, two\nTom Kibble, one of the winners of the Higgs boson competition\nwere associated with Imperial:\nthose of Professor Kibble and the\njoint entry of Mary and Ian\nButterworth, of Imperial College\nwith Doris and Vigdor Teplitz of\nthe Southern Methodist College.\nThe other winners were,\nProfessor Roger Cashmore,\nUniversity of Oxford, Simon\nHands, European Organisation for\nNuclear Research (CERN) and Dr\nDavid Miller of University College\nLondon.\nCopies of the winning entries\nare available from the Felix office.\nGuy's and Thomas's Hospitals\nDevastation\nBY ANDREW TSENG\nStaff at Guy's and St Thomas's hospitals have been left reeling this\nweek after it was announced that\n2000 jobs are to be axed. 800 beds\ncould also be lost, casualties of\nrecent NHS reforms introduced by\nthe Health Secretary, Virginia\nBottomley.\nThe changes in the NHS have\nintroduced an internal ' NHS marketplace'. This has caused\nmany health authorities to\nwithdraw their funding of some of\nLondon's hospitals. The money has\ninstead gone to the cheaper\nsuburban hospitals.\nAs a result of this, Guy's and St\nThomas's hospitals face a \u00a375\nmillion loss over the next five\nyears. University College Hospital,\nseen by many as one of the\nCapital's strongest hospitals, both\nfinancially and academically, has\nbeen similarly threatened.\nIn response to the need for\ndrastic cuts, the joint management\nhave released a document\ndescribing proposals which will\nseriously affect the two hospitals. It\ndetails the need for spending to be\nreduced by around 30 per cent. One\nof the proposals is that the current\nworkforce of 7000 people must be\nreduced to 2000 by 1998. This\nwould have the knock-on effect of\nthe loss of around 800 beds and one\nof the accident and emergency\nunits.\nA decision must also be made as\nto whether the hospitals should\nremain on two sites or be combined\non a single site. This would remove\nthe physical separation of the two\nhospitals that have now been\nmerged for several years.\nBoth Guy's and St Thomas's hospitals are teaching hospitals for\nGuy's Medical and Dental schools.\nAlthough the cuts do not affect the\nschools directly, there is little doubt\nthat any large scale cuts to the\nhospitals will have a detrimental\neffect on the medical schools. The\neffect on the local community\ncould also be devastating since, of\nthe 600,000 patients at the two\nhospitals over the last year, over\n400,000 were from the local area.\nIn brief\nKnow Your Rights\nThe mystery of welfare benefits has\nbeen unraveled by a program\ndeveloped by Professor Brian\nJarman, Head of the Department of\nGeneral Practice at St Mary's Hospital Medical School.\nThe program entitled, 'The\nLisson Grove Welfare Benefits\nProgram' provides GPs throughout\nthe UK with detailed information\non welfare benefit entitlements.\nProfessor Jarman believes\npatients suffer less from stress if\nthey have immediate access to, and\na clear understanding of, their\nwelfare rights.\nFar East Contacts\nA UK/Japan and Asia-Pacific\nAdvisory Group on Science and\nTechnology has been set up to\nadvise the British Government.\nThrough the Chancellor of the\nDuchy of Lancaster, they are\nrecommending ways to foster\nbeneficial scientific and\ntechnological relations with Japan\nand other countries in the Far East.\nFunding Changes\nThe Department for Education is\ncurrently in consultation with\nstudents on what has been termed\nthe 'Voluntary Membership White\nPaper'.\nCurrent proposals split student\nunion funding into core and non-core areas. Core areas would be\nable to be funded with public\nmoney, whereas to do so with\nnon-core areas would be classed as\n'ultra-vire s'. Controversy has arisen in the\ninterpretation of core and non-core\nareas. Under the present proposals,\na rugby club could be funded by\npublic funds, whist the orchestra\ncould not. The consultation period\nis set to be completed by the end of\nOctober.\nPrompt Payment\nStudents, universities and colleges\nhave a right to expect grants and\ntuition fees to be paid promptly by\nLocal Education Authorities.\nEducation Secretary John Patten\nsaid recently: \"Students have a right to a high quality service - and\nwe must work to see that they get\nit. I look forward to your cooperation in bringing this about.\"\nJoin the team - meet us in Beit Quad at Freshers' Fair\n\n"

The Ents crew are here with three events this week to liven\nthe soul and enlighten the mind.\nMonday 4th October - New Year Carnival.\nJoining the Ents crew will be The Drum Club\nplaying live and supported by DJ Charlie Hall.\nThe Drum Club have been running one of\nLondon's most successful midweek clubs for\nwell over a year now at the Soundshaft (just off\nCharing Cross Rd). They've had major success\nwith their critically acclaimed first album\nfollowing which they've been heavily in demand\nfor their remixing abilities, giving new direction\nto some indie bands such as Lush. Downstairs\nwill be Dodgy.\nHeadlining downstairs will be Dodgy,\nwarming up for an extensive Autumn tour and\nfresh from their hugely successful performance\nat Glastonbury. This London three-piece have\nrecently hit the National Top 40 and topped the\nindie charts with indie anthems 'Water Under\nThe Bridge' and 'I Need Another'. Playing\nsongs from their recently acclaimed 'Dodgy\nAlbum', it'll be Dodgy's music playing in that\nlift up to heaven.\nTo kick the whole week off, and supporting\nDodgy will be Boy Girl Soup. These are hotly\ntipped up and coming band who have been\ntouring all over London picking up a large\nfollowing. With two singles on Boot records and\ntwo excellent Melody Maker reviews behind\nthem, London eagerly awaits the release of the\nnew single at the end of October. Remember\nwhere you saw them first!\nAfter the bands finish downstairs the Ents\ndisco keeps pump in' till 3am. Take a rest, grab a burger, and check out the Carnival attractions in\nthe Union Dining Hall on the first floor.\nWednesday 6th October - Comedy Night\nWe change the pace of things with a comedy\nspectacular. On the top of the bill will be Stewart\nLee who has had major success as part of the\nwriting and performing duo Lee & Herring.\nThey write for 'On the Hour' on Radio 4 for\nwhich they won the coveted Writers Guild\nAward. They were the judges choice for the Best\nRadio Comedy at the British Comedy Awards in\n1992. Earmarked as 'The one to watch in 1993'\nin NME' s AZ of comedy, it's Lee's stand up solo act which is now kick in' up a storm.\nBacking him up will be Tim Vine, a real joke\nmachine gun; if he doesn't get you with the first\nhe'll get you with the second (or the third, or the\nfourth . . .). Holding it all together will be\ncom per e Rainer Hersch, described in TNT as\n\"possibly the best com per eI have ever seen\".\nAfter those hangover blues have been well\nand truly laughed off, grab a drink (late bar till\n12am), and shake it in the disco 'til lam. Ticket\nholders must arrive no later than 8.15pm to be\nguaranteed entry into the Comedy Night.\nSidi Bou Said are playing at the Freshers' Ball\nFriday 8th October - Freshers' Ball\nThere's time to rest before a real knees-up end-of-the-week type thing. Dress is informal, as is\nattitude! Playing downstairs are Sidi Bou Said,\nan all girl group who have attracted massive\nattention in the music press over the last six\nmonths since the release of the critically\nacclaimed singles 'Twilight Eyes' and 'Three\nSides' which has only held off the indie top spot\nby some band called Suede. They release their\nalbum 'Broooch' on October 11th. Support will\ncome from the hotly tipped Drugstore who\nrecently released a heartbreaking beauty of a single called 'Alive'. Their distinctive style\ncomes from the Brazilian singer/bassist and their\nferocious guitars. Voted the second best new\nband in Britain after their storming performance\nat ' in The City' in Manchester, great things\nsurely await this young trio.\nEntertainment in the Union Dining Hall is of\na more refined nature on this night in the form of\nthe Guild's Casino, with top prizes to be won.\nUpstairs, variety is the order of the day. JC 001\nleads the way with his fast rhymes and pounding\nrhythms; he's acknowledged as the fastest rapper\nin the world (just ask Norris!). Tackling all sorts\nof issues, diversely influenced, verbally\ndemanding, visually riveting, the man speaks\nvolumes. The band action culminates with The\nFunking Barstewards, the ultimate party band\nand the Mean Fiddler's Best Live Band Of 1992.\nThe party doesn't stop there, the Ents disco will\nkeep runnin' till 3 am with rush to the bar for last\norder at 2am. Pace yourself guys 'n' girls - it's gonna be a long night.\nTickets are likely to sell out in advance so get\nthem quick from the Union Office. The Monday\nand Friday tickets are priced at \u00a36 each and the\ncomedy night is \u00a34 on the door (if there are any\nseats are still available). Week tickets are only\n\u00a312 for all three events but are limited. If you've\nordered tickets by post, collect them from the\nUnion Office by 5pm on Monday 'cos it shuts\nthen.\nMat Park\nEnts Chairperson '93- 94\nDuring your travels on Tuesday don't forget\nto come and see us at Freshers' Fair, we'll\nbe in the Ents Lounge in the Union Building.\nThe crew will be ready to tell you\neverything that is the world of Ents.\nDon't forget you need your ID card to get into any Union event\n\n"

The\nset which followed reassured all present that\nthere is still life in the British music scene\ncapable of taking on the American guitar bands\nat their own game. The highlight of their set was\n'Good Day Song', the present single, which was\nby far the best performance of any of the support\nacts. They bowed out with the closing song of\ntheir album, 'Bad Day Song'. Bivouac were the\nonly support act which deserved to play longer.\nNext up were New Yorkers Madder Rose,\nwho suffered from the problem of inaudible\nvocals as the guitars went into overdrive. The\nband themselves seemed to have lost most of\ntheir delicacy, as exhibited on 'Baby Gets High'\nwhich lost its appealing background feedback.\nUltimately it was a mediocre performance\nalthough the lyrics hinted that better could be\nforthcoming as expounded in Mary Larson's repeated \"I only feel happy when you're down.\"\nCome, it seems, were to be the spine chillers\non the bill. However, judging from this\nexperience, they have some way to go to earn\nsuch a reputation. They could do worse than take\nnote of the set played by Sugar.\nThe first view we got of Sugar was seeing\nMalcolm Travis walking round the queue\nwaiting to get into the Academy. Bob Mould\nappeared in the lunatic, liar, lord shirt he's worn\nfor every live date played after the release of\n'Beaster'. They immediately blasted into 'The\nAct We Act', ' A Good Idea' and 'Changes', (the\nopening salvo from 'Copper Blue') giving less\nof a breath ful and more of a lung ful of fresh air\nto each. From all reports, the Sugar performance\nat Great Xpectations was turgid, something\nwhich could not have been said of tonight's performance which displayed almost the entire\nSugar catalogue with a few extra additions.\nAbout halfway through their set, they went\ninto ' MTV Unplugged' mode with Bob taking\nup acoustic guitar and Travis on percussive s. 'Hoover Dam', their first song, was followed by\nthe chart friendly 'If I Can't Change Your\nMind'. The instrumental 'Clownmaster' was the\nperfect launch pad back into the world of\ncontrolled electrical mayhem which was\nmirrored in the crowd's frenzied reaction. Dave\nBarbe proved his worth on 'Anyone' and the\nsuperb 'Where Diamonds Are Halos'. Sugar\nalso began their attack on 'Beaster' which\nintensified the tracks there, even 'Tilted'.

There's Chance and Community Chest cards around to\nhelp, too. Mencap throw a free party with in the\nevening for all the day's collectors where all the\nprizes are handed out. Do you fancy winning a skiing trip in Andorra? This is the event for you.\nRAG Week\n- starts 3rd November\nStarting with the Beer Festival, RAG Week is\nactually ten days of fun and frivolity. There's no\nway to avoid RAG week (short of going to\nSiberia) but it's much more fun if you actually\ntake part. We have two enormous parties\n(Freshers' Week style), a hypnotist, a slave\nauction, bungee jumping, silly sports including\nmixed-sex rugby, a Hit Squad, inter-hall\ncompetitions and much, much more. The Beer\nFestival also sees the launch of this year's RAG Mag, that infamous publication which has to be\nread to be believed.\nRAG Parties\n- every fortnight\nThroughout the term, RAG are also running\nfortnightly parties in association with I.C. Radio.\nThese parties all have reductions for anyone who\ncollects on the day's event. Some are even free\nfor collectors. Others are themed with reductions\nfor appropriate dress, such as the Rocky Horror\nNight on 30th October. Proceeds from all these\nparties will go to charity.\nHow Do I Get Involved\nFirst of all, seek us out at Freshers' Fair and sign\nup for everything. Find out more and grab some\nfreebies. We have meetings every Friday at\n1.10pm. These are held in the Ents Lounge,\nopposite Da Vinci's, on the ground floor of the\nUnion building. We can also be found in the\nRAG Office (second floor, east staircase, Union\nbuilding) during most lunchtimes. So come and\nsample our coffee and nick our biscuits!\nDon't forget...\nIt's all free and we run an incentive scheme for\ncollectors, so even if you don't win any of the\nprizes, you can earn exclusive RAG mugs,\nT shirts, rugby shirts and tankards depending on\nhow much you manage to collect throughout the\nyear.\nRead about the Underwater Club's exploits on pages 24 and 25\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\nHair\nExactly 25 years ago, Hair shocked many and the\nanti-war message had real meaning. Now, Hair is\nmore like a trip down memory lane with its flares,\npom-pom hairstyles and anti-war (and anti-American) message.\nFrom the opening song 'Aquarius', I was\ncaptivated throughout the almost bearable two and\nthree quarter hours by a generation that I was never\ntaught about at school. For me, Hair was more of\nan education than a chance to clap along to the\nsongs and remember the good old days. I did clap\nanyway because I loved them all and although the\nclothes are dated, the songs seemed as fresh as the\nday they were written.\nThe elements of the original 1968 version are\nstill in it: nudity, swearing, love, peace, flowers,\npot, audience participation, a drag artist (don't ask!)\nand of course, lots and lots of sex.\nWith all its stars and strobe lights and revolving\nstage, Hair is now a reminder of the ideals of the\nsixties, what the sixties meant and what it did or did\nnot do for the world. Go and see Hair for the very\ngood songs and quite a potent blast from the past.\nHenri and Henrietta\nOld Vic. Mon-Sat 7.45pm. \u00a38-\u00a325. (Don't bother\nwith tickets for the exclusive seats. They are crap.)\n(P.S. John Barrowman: you are a lily-live red coward for not stripping. Henrietta was looking\nforward to seeing your talent all evening and not\nonce did she get a chance to use her measuring\ntape. - Henri.)\nlull\nAn Inspector\nCalls\nAn ingenious play by J.B. Priestly that is fronted\nby a myriad of stars is ruined by the symbolist ic and highly pretentious production.\nIt starts in a 'normal' sort of way: the family\nare having dinner and then suddenly a Police\nInspector calls. The rest evolves from there and\neveryone at the table, with the exception of the\nmaid, is involved.\nBut as soon as the Inspector is invited inside\nand the psychotic looking stage house opens out,\nI felt that bitter sensation of disappointment in\nmy mind, and knew instantly that the producer\nhad effortlessly obtained a PhD in arty-far tyne s s, without even having to reading the\ncredits in the programme.\nIt's a shame to see class talent (Julian Glover\nand Kenneth Cranham, to name but two), not\nsuch much wasted, but de-emphasised by a pompous and self-important producer.\nThere are some good points in the play, apart\nfrom the quality actors. The humour is very\nfunny and also very deep, with most of it being\ndelivered by the women. And the set is a lot of\nthings at the same time; it is frightening,\nbeautiful, convincing, but alas the talent used to\ncolour and paint it was wasted by its eventual\nuse by the producers.\nI know it is possibly improper to compare\nbooks and films and plays, but the book is better\nthan play and the black and white film starring\nAlistair Syms as the Inspector is the best of all.\nMoney spent on the book or the film is a shrewder investment than spending money on\ntickets for this version of what was a damn good\nstory.\nHarry\nAldwych, WC2. Prices start at \u00a37.50. Mon-Fri\n7.45pm. Sat 5pm and 8.15pm. Free film and\ntheatre tickets!\nDrop into the Felix Office and\nsee what we've got available.\nAll we ask for in return is a review.\nIt's as easy as that!\nGrease\nCraig MacLachghlan's and Debbie Gibson's voices have improved considerably since their\npop career debuts. They put on an excellent\nperformance that is second only to the 1978\nfilm. They both fit into the roles of Danny and\nSandy perfectly, and obviously enjoyed their\nparts well. Both deserved the deafening\napplause at the end and I feel that it was them\nthat the audience were crying out for when they\nshouted for more.\nThe rest of the cast fit well into their roles as\nwell, except for Rizzo, whose part wasn't played with enough rebellion and spice. The TBirds and Pink Ladies are good and once or\ntwice they actually surpass the characters in the\nfilm. Shane Ritchie was brilliant as Kenickie\nand could follow a career in singing.\nThe stage is lit up in true fifties style and the\ncostumes stick well to the fifties era. However,\ncertain production hiccups are apparent for\nwhen the scene changes, the audience can be\nleft waiting for up to thirty seconds, which can\nbe irritating and disappointing for some.\nAs the show flies towards its finale, the\nwhole thing becomes one giant sing-a long,\nwith the audience standing up, clapping, and\nyelling at the top of their voices. It was almost\nas rowdy as Rocky Horror but it was true family\nentertainment with only a very, very small sign\nof sex and sexual innuendos.\nThis is the best West End play at the\nmoment and it beats the pants off Sunset. The\nDominion have a winner on their hands and I hope it's still there in years to come.\nHarry\nDominion Theatre. Mon-Sat 7.30pm. \u00a310-\u00a325.\nBooked solid until next year. Only cli ance is a standby, an hour before the show.\nAll you need to know about Freshers' Fair - see centre pages\n\n"

    "content": "6 Reviews\nSam Baldwin (Tom Hanks) with his 'cute' son Jonah (Ross Malinger)\nSleepless in\nSeattle\nStarring: Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan\nDirector: Nora Ephron\nRunning Time: 105 mins\nWhat if you heard someone on the radio, and\nwithout ever meeting, you knew they were the\nperfect person for you? Sleepless in Seattle takes\nus through the ultimate blind date fantasy. Annie\nReed (Meg Ryan) hears an agony programme on\nher car radio one Christmas Eve and falls for the\nvoice of Sam Baldwin (Tom Hanks).\nSam has been widowed for 18 months and\ncan't come to terms with his loss, while his cute\nson Jonah (Ross Malinger) has resorted to\nringing up radio agony aunts to solve his father's problems. Annie Reed is engaged to predictable\nWalter (Bill Pullman) and is subconsciously\nsearching for that fateful 'magic' encounter with\nthe man of her dreams.\nOnce the initial connection is made, the film\ngoes through a series of events that lead us to an\ninevitable conclusion. This film is an antidote to\nall the recent violence and explicit sex of\nHollywood movies. The style is very similar to\ni Ml MMM S MM The Fugitive\nStarring: Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones\nDirector: Andrew Davis\nRunning Time: 140 mins\nHarrison Ford plays a reputable Chicago\nsurgeon who is charged with murdering his\nwife. Unable to prove his story of being\nattacked by a one armed man he is convicted\nand sentenced to prison.\nWhile being transferred from a prison, he\nmanages to escape and becomes a fugitive,\nhunted by the police and the Federal authorities.\nUnder their relentless pressure he tries to clear\nhis name and find the true murderer.\nThe chase is led by a Federal Marshall,\nTommy Lee Jones, who starts to believe in\nFord's innocence as the chase continues.\nHowever, Ford stays one step ahead of them\nwhile outwitting his pursuers.\nA good film to watch that shares many\nlocations with the 'Blues Brothers'. The plot\nmoves swiftly, leading to the eventual\nunmasking of the killer. Ford's recollection of\nthe events of his wife's murder that evening are\ntold through a series of flashbacks that become\nlonger and more detailed during the film as his\nmemory improves.\nA very watch able film.\nBlodwin\n'When Harry Met Sally' with a soundtrack of\nold hits ('When I Fall In Love', 'As Time Goes\nBy') with close friends lending an ear and advice\nto the lonely singles. However, even with all\nthese parallels the film lacks the humour and the\ntension that made 'When Harry Met Sally' so\nwatch able. Sleepless in Seattle is directed by\nNora Ephron who wrote the screenplay for\nBoiling Point\nStarring: Wesley Snipes, Dennis Hopper\nDirector: James B Harris\nRunning Time: 93 mins\nWhy Wesley Snipes didn't insist on having his\nname withdrawn from the credits will no doubt\nbecome one of life's biggest mysteries. Come to\nthink of it, why did he even agree to do the film\nin the first place? Surely he doesn't need the\nwork that desperately?\nIf you haven't guessed already, this film's a bit of a doozy (that's bad). The original novel,\nMoney Men by Gerald Petievich, was probably\ngood or at least readable, but James Harris, who\nwrote the screenplay and directed the film, must\ntake all of the criticisms that the film begs for.\nThe story's about a U.S. treasury agent,\n'When Harry Met Sally', hence the similarities.\nTom Hanks and Meg Ryan play their parts\nwell as new man and dizzy blonde, but Ross\nMalinger is just another cute Hollywood child.\nThis film is worth watching if you want to see a good old fashioned romance, but if you're after\nrealism, forget it.\nKamran Malik.\nJimmy Mercer (Snipes), avenging his partner's death after a double cross over some counterfeit\nmoney. The bad guy is called 'Red' Diamond\n(Hopper), a con-man recently out of prison who\nis conning his young jail-mate into shooting\neveryone for him.\nHarris tries desperately to draw parallels\nbetween the lives of Mercer and Diamond and\ndoes so by switching between the characters in\nthe same annoying way a baby does with a remote control in the middle of your favourite\nprogramme.\nThe film is stuffed with people who tried to\nget into the film business about 10 years ago,\nprobably because they're now past it and going\ncheap. My guess is that Harris put his reputation\nas a \"highly respected Hollywood veteran\" (as\nthe film's blurb insists he is) on the line to get\nthis made. In which case he's lost it.\nPenguin\nIf you fancy reviewing films, theatre, music,\nbooks, opera or exhibitions, drop in to the\nFelix Office (far left hand corner of Beit Quad)\nand see what's available.\nFilmSoc's screenings for this month are on the back page\n\n"

    "content": "St Mary's Union 29\nWhat Lies Across Hyde Park?\nThefirst of many articles that will keep you up to date with the happenings in\nthe world of St Mary's Hospital Medical School and its Student Union. To\nbegin with, here's a bit of background information .. .\nImperial College and St Mary's Hospital\nMedical School have been merged for five years,\nyet social ties between the students from both\nsides of Hyde Park can best be described as\nlimited. The only substantial integration has\nbeen between the music and rowing clubs from\nboth institutions. This has been to their\nadvantage, particularly for St Mary's. It's not hard to understand why there has\nbeen so little interaction. A merger between two\nquite separate and autonomous institutions\nunderstandably faced considerable resistance\nfrom both sides.\nThe merger was the first step towards the\ncreation of a new 'super' West London School\nof Medicine. This would undoubtedly make it\nthe single largest faculty within Imperial\nCollege, but this has not yet happened.\nThe geographical separation of the two sites\nhas contributed to this lack of integration, but\none of the factors has admittedly been the\nreluctance of St Mary's to make any effort. This\nhas ranged from apathy to downright active\n'anti-Imperialism'.\nWith the Tomlinson Report recommendations\nbehind us, we can only think of this as\nremarkable foresight and that it was a shame\nCharing Cross Hospital did not take up the\nopportunity to join us at that time.\nMost students from the pre-merger era have\nnow qualified. This does not mean that there are\nno anti-Imperial feelings left but it is certainly\nbecoming a diminishing force.\nIt would be nice to see a translation of the\ngood relations currently existing between the\nrespective student unions onto a wider forum.\nMore integration by various clubs and societies\nshould be encouraged with bands from both\nsides playing 'across the park'. We at St Mary's Student Union have already booked a coach to\nbring all our fresher s across to the Freshers' Fair\nat Imperial College on Tuesday.\nPromoting and advertising each others social\nevents throughout the year on both sites would\nhelp a great deal. We will also try to submit\nsomething to Felix every week to keep everyone\ninformed of events and student life at St Mary's. In the meantime you are all cordially invited\nto two of the biggest nights at St Mary's. Firstly,\nthere is the Toga Party on Wednesday 6th October, where a toga is compulsory! Secondly,\nthere is the Bands Night on Saturday 9th October, when we will hopefully be having\nsome Imperial College bands playing as well as\nsome from St Mary's. Be warned though,\nmedical students are particularly mad and\ndaring, especially during Freshers' Week!\nIn subsequent issues, we hope to give you\nmore of an insight into medical school life,\nmedics themselves and perhaps also a taste of\n'Marmalade Sandwich', St Mary's own student\nmagazine.\nSt Mary's Freshers' Week Events\nToga Party\nWednesday 6th October\nMedical School Basement\nAdmission \u00a32\nBands Night\nSaturday 9th October\nWilson House Recreation Centre,\nSussex Gardens.\nPlease bring your Imperial ID card\nFancy tid dling your wink down Oxford Street?

    "content": "24 Clubs and Societies\nHaving Fun In Rubber.\nThe Underwater Club's summer tour was split into two parts this year. First\nthey went to Oban on the west coast of Scotland and then onto to Scapa Flow\nin the Orkneys. Read on for an account of their exploits.\nOban is reckoned to be one of the best diving\nareas in the country, with warm water from the\nGulf Stream and some great wrecks and\nstunning scenery. This year we were also blessed\nwith good weather!\nOur first dive of the week was in shallow\nwater to give the novices a chance to get\nacc lim at is ed. Unlike the bog standard 'scenic\ndive' (for scenic read kelp), this one had the\nadded attraction of tant a lising glimpses of seals\nand disconcerting ly close views of the\nomnipresent Scottish jellyfish. A group of our\ndivers got cornered by a young seal in a bay\nwhere it investigated our intrepid explorers for\nquarter of an hour before deciding they were\ninedible.\nOur next day's diving was to be on the S. S. Breada, a Dutch cargo ship sunk in 1941 on her\nway to India. We burned round the headland in\nthe rigid inflatable boat (see picture) on a mill pond sea in glorious sunshine to where the\nwreck was suppose to be. Greeting us were two\nlarge buoys about 100m apart with 'S. S. Breada'\nwritten on them, so no need for the echo sounder\nto give us some idea of how big this wreck was.\nDescending to 25m in clear water, the hull of\nthe wreck slowly came into view. The five\ncavernous holds of this ship are still crammed\nwith cargo, each hold taking a dive to explore. It\nwas like exploring a dusty old junk shop, with\nevery corner turning up a surprise. We found\npots of shaving cream, a tube of Maclean's toothpaste (1940's vintage, it tasted awful) and a rack of rusting bicycles. Pieces of eight it may\nnot be, but we did find bundles of old Rupee\nnotes, bleached by the\nsea with the watermark\nstill visible! A forage to\nthe ships engine room\nwas undertaken by the\nmore experienced divers,\nbut unfortunately some\nself-centred looters had\npillaged all the brass\nfittings before we could\nget to them!\nUnlike in previous\nyears, we now possess a large high powered rigid\ninflatable boat. This enables us to range much\nfurther afield in our diving sorties, thus we were\nable to dive the wreck of the Shuna in the sound\nof Mull, a trip which in previous years would\nhave needed the hire of a hard boat and skipper.\nThis trip was not, however, all fun and\ngames. Apart from training beginners up to\nnovice standard and beyond, the annual dive\nrescue review saw even the 'old lags' being\nforced to prove their prowess in rescuing and\nA group of divers got\ncornered by a seal\nwhich investigated them\nfor quarter of an hour\nbefore deciding they\nwere inedible.\nresuscitating distressed divers. I am glad to write\nthat none of their 'bodies' were more de-stressed\nafter rescue than before. Comment was raised by\nthe natives about the realistic approach to the\nsituation taken by rescuers and casualties alike.\nAll too soon, the week was over. Back to\nLondon for the babes and on to Scapa for the old\nlags.\nWell, St Tropaz it wasn't. Looking out of the\nScrabbster to Orkney ferry at the waves and\novercast sky, we could not help wistfully\nrecalling the beaches and sun of that resort\nwhere we had toured last\nsummer, but then this,\nunlike St Tropaz and\nOban, was not a trip for\nbeginners and sun\nworshippers.\nFor those who do not\nknow of Scapa Flow, it\nis the huge natural\nharbour created by the\nhundreds of islands that\nmake up the Orkneys.\nThe Navy has used the\nflow as a base for its\nfleets for over a century, adding defences against\nnew threats as they were invented (for example,\nblock ships and the Churchill barriers against UBoot (sic) attacks).\nAlthough the Orkneys contain the wrecks of\nhistorically famous ships such as the Royal Oak\nand H.M.S. Hampshire, Lord Kitchener's final\nresting place, we were unable to dive these\nvessels due to their status as war graves. This\nleft us with the block ships and the remains of\nthe World War I German High Seas Fleet, the\nlatter having earned the Orkneys the arguable\nhonour of being of the world's third best dive\nsite.\nAt the end of World War I, the fleet, under\ncommand of Admiral von Reuter, was\nimpounded at Scapa to be split up and used by\nBritain. This got up the Admiral's nose, so early\none morning he sent the command \"Absatz Elf,\nBestaetigen,\" which roughly translated as \"Open\nall sea cocks and scupper the lot,\".\nOf over 72 destroyers, battleships and other\nassorted war ships, only about 12 remain on the\nsea bed, due to extensive salvage. However what\nthey lack in numbers they make up for in\ngrandeur.\nWe hired a hard boat, the Girl Mina, and her\nskippers Terry and Squire for the duration of our\nstay. Terry is a22 stone Orkadian with a totally\nincomprehensible accent, except when on the\nradio to the coast guard. Squire, the star of the\nvessel, was a sheep dog, but at least he was\nunderstandable, one bark meant: \"We are\napproaching the site, get ready!\" while two barks\nmeant: \"We're here, jump in!\".\nA routine was soon established: a deep dive\nin the morning followed by lunch in the nearest\npub (Terry seemed to be very well known\neverywhere). Then there was a shallower dive on\na block ship if the tidal currents permitted, or on\nthe smaller fleet vessels, which, like the large\nwrecks, can be dived at all states of the tide.\nThe deeper ships included the cruisers and\nbattleships. Since the cruisers were shallower,\nthese were the first to be dived so that we could\nbuild up our depth tolerance. All these vessels\nA Jazz and Rock Club article is on page 27\n\n"

But we survived to\nbring you another glorious year of STOIC.\nSTOIC?? I hear you cry. Yes! The Student\nTelevision Of Imperial College. A new studio\ncomplex on the third floor of the Union Building\nbrings you the greatest thing to hit the College\nsince Neighbours!\nThe old studio was getting rather cramped,\nhaving been there for the last six years. The\ncure? Demolish the whole place and completely\nrebuild. A larger studio, control room and office\nhave been created and we've even improved our\ncable network, enabling you to watch STOIC in\nall the Southside halls, the JCR, Beit Hall and\nDa Vinci's. All we need now is you.\nDuring Freshers' Week our news and film\ncrews will be all over the College, making items\nfor our news programmes, as well as for two\nfeatures: Terminated III and Predator - A fresher's guide. For the latter, filming starts on\nthe first day of term. If you see a guy in a funny\nsuit covered in strange make-up, followed by aTV crew, it's us! Come and help - we need\nextras and may need people behind the camera\non other days. We'll be at Freshers' Fair on\nTuesday in Da Vinci's on the ground floor of the\nUnion building in Beit Quad.\nIf you don't see us out and about, come up to\nthe studio at any time - there will always be\nsomeone there. Whether you want to act, write\nscripts, produce programmes, edit tapes, read the\nnews, direct live programmes or be an\nequipment operator, we can find you something\nto do. Maybe you've got a programme idea but\nno-one to help you with it. We can give you a studio, lighting, presenters and training on our\nequipment. We have the facilities to make\nprogrammes just as good as the ones you see on\ntelevision.\nIf you come up this weekend, we can show\nyou how to use the cameras, and during\nFreshers' Week you could get free entry to the\ncarnivals and the comedy night by working a camera, vision or sound mixing or even directing\nour live broadcasts.\nWatch out for the posters showing our first\nweek's schedule. After that, we're back to\nnormal, showing STOIC News live at 1.15pm every Tuesday and Thursday lunchtime, as well\nas Into The Night, our weekly live stint from\n5pm until 11pm every Thursday. Join us for that,\neither by watching TV or by helping us in the\nstudio.\nNeedless to say, it's a great evening's entertainment on both sides of the screen.\nOpposites\nAttract\nThe Operatic Society, known as OpSoc,\ngenerally perform two shows a year: one in\nCollege in early February, the other is combined\nwith a two week holiday in July. Next term, we\nplan to perform 'Chicago', a very energetic\nshow set amongst the sleaze of 1930s Chicago.\nBefore this, however, our Freshers' Fair\nevent will be on the weekend of the 16th/17 th October. The show is 'Opposites Attract' a rock\n'n' Roll rip-off of 'Romeo and Juliet'.\nThe emphasis of OpSoc this year is on\nhaving as many parties as possible, so if you\nwish to tread the boards, hit the spotlights, risk\npossible mega-stardom and get very drunk all at\nthe same time, come and see us at Freshers'\nFair.

    "content": "30 Imperial College Union\n'Starting out' at anything can be one of the most stressful experiences we\never have to face. New surroundings to deal with, trying to find your\nbearings, making friends, getting lost, reading all the bits of paper thrown at\nyou, getting lost again, while it seems that everyone around you knows where\nthey are and where they're going.\nIf you remember this from The Intro (part of the Imperial College Union Handbook), then you'll\nremember that Imperial College Students' Union is here to help you.\nThe Students Union is located in Beit Quad, which is home to the Freshers' Week events. Here\nyou'll find all the advice, information, clubs, student officers and sabbaticals you'll ever need to help\nyou through your course at Imperial. And this article is to introduce the sabbaticals of Imperial\nCollege Union (ICU) to you.\nAt Imperial College we have four sabbatical officers. They are students, elected through a cross\ncampus ballot to work for the Union for one year. The four post are: President, Deputy President\n(Finance & Services), Deputy President (Clubs & Societies) and the Felix Editor. And here they are:\nAndrew Wensley, President\nTelephone x3501. Andy is the ultimate representative for the students of Imperial College. He is\nresponsible for the overall organisation of the Union including its constitution.\nHe co-ordinates the work of the Executive and, with the Union Manager, is\nresponsible for all staffing and disciplinary issues. Andrew finished his degree in\nMathematics last year.\nDavid Goddard, Deputy President (Finance & Services)\nTelephone x3502. Dave is in charge of the finances of Imperial College Union. He has to ensure\nthat the budgeting of the Union is effective. He also has responsibility for the\ncommercial services and trading activities of the Union. He deals with\naccommodation matters concerning the students of Imperial College. Dave has\njust finished his Physics degree.\nDon't Forget:\n1. To Register.\nYou can do this in the Junior Common Room\n(JCR) along the walkway by the Sherfield\nbuilding. You have to do this in order to get\nyour swipe card if you are a first year and your\nUnion card if you are in any other year. (This is\nthe first year we have produced combined swipe\nand Union cards.) The swipe card is your\nidentification card while you are at College and\nmust be worn at all times.\n2. To Party.\nYou can buy tickets to the Freshers' Week\nevents on Monday, Wednesday and Friday from\nthe Union Office.\nIf you are asked by a member of Union\nsecurity (stewards who wear yellow t shirts or\nsweatshirts), you must produce your swipe card.\nYou will be asked by stewards for your swipe or\nUnion card at the front gate of the Union\nbuilding on the evening of any Union event,\nsuch as those in Freshers' Week.\nCharles Leary, Deputy President (Clubs & Societies)\nTelephone x3503. Charlie is responsible for the coordination and representation of the Union's130 clubs and societies. He represents their varied interests in the Union and College\nas well as to outside organisations such as the Universities' Athletic Union.\nAlong with Dave, he is responsible for the security of the Union Building.\nCharlie completed his Biology degree last year.\nBeccy Land, Felix Editor\nTelephone x3515. Beccy is responsible for producing our weekly student newspaper, Felix. It hits\nthe streets every week on Friday, ideal for that 10 o 'clock lecture. Look out for it\nin the entrances to each department. As well as this, she manages the Print Unit,\nthe cheapest print shop around. Beccy, like Dave, has just finished her degree in\nPhysics.\nThe sabbaticals can usually be found in the Union building. Andy, Dave and Charlie have offices in\nthe Union Office (first floor) and Beccy is based in the Felix office in the far left-hand corner of Beit\nQuad. If they aren't there, then they're probably in a meeting in the College.\nIf there is anything you are unsure of or want to know about, give them a call or drop in and ask\nthem in person. They'll normally be able to give you an answer straight away. Failing that they'll get\nback to you as fast as they can.\n3. To Go To Freshers'\nFair on Tuesday.\nSign up for everything. Seriously, you may\nforget to find out about a club later in the year\nand miss out on a lot of fun. So do it now. You\ncan find an article on the Freshers' Fair on the\ncentre pages of this issue.\nParking Permits.\nIf you are eligible for a student parking\npermit, application forms are available\nfrom the Union Office (1st floor, Union\nBuilding) from 4th October, the first\nMonday of term. They must be returned to\nthe Union Office by 8th October, the\nfollowing Friday.\nPeople with disabilities, medical\nconditions and females who work late in\nCollege are given priority. Last year we\nhad 500 applications for 70 permits, so\nplease don't apply unless these conditions\napply and please don't be surprised if your\napplication is unsuccessful.\nThe Union's Advice Service is located in the Union Office\n\n"

The\nRoyal College of Science has lost\nits Honorary Secretary, whilst the\nCity and Guilds College no longer\nhas a Vice President.\nOn Monday 6th September,\nDuncan Austen, also known as\n'Badger' resigned from his elected\npost of Honorary Secretary of the\nRoyal College of Science. Miss\nRhian Picton, President of the\nRoyal College of Science, in an\ninterview with Felix said that, \"it\nwas a mutually acceptable decision.\nHe was asked, I didn't tell him. He\nresigned because vital work hadn't been done,\". When asked for\nfurther details, Miss Picton stated,\n\"I had given him prior warning that\nI was not happy a month before he\nmade his decision,\".\nBY ANDREW TSENG\nSufferers of fish odour syndrome\nhave now been told that they\ncannot do anything about their\npersonal freshness problem - it is\ninherited. This follows a study by\nresearchers at St Mary's Hospital\nMedical School which found that a gene is the cause of fish odour\nsyndrome.\nFish odour syndrome is one of\nthe most common causes of bad\nbreath and odorous perspiration.\nAccording to a recent report in the\nBritish Medical Journal, sufferers\nof the disease admit to suicidal\ntendencies, social isolation,\nparanoia, depression and feelings of\nshame.\nThe group at St Mary's investigated the conditions of\nalmost 200 people, after an\nadvertisement was placed in The\nIndependent for volunteers who\nmight have had a body odour\nproblem, to take part in the study.\nThe study found that 1 in 15 of\nthose people tested had fish odour\nWhen asked whether the\nresignation was demanded of Mr Austen, Miss Picton gave an\nemphatic, \"No\". She did, however,\nadd that the lack of an Honorary\nSecretary has not had a particularly\ndetrimental effect on the Royal\nCollege of Science and that almost\nall the tasks the Honorary Secretary\nhas to do had since been completed.\nDuncan Austen was unavailable\nfor comment as Felix went to press.\nThe City and Guilds College\nUnion has lost its Vice President\ndue to academic affairs. The\nelected Vice President, Joe\nBaguley, failed to get through to\nthe third year of his course and has\nhence been forced to leave the\ncollege.

When questioned about the effect\nthe disease had on them, sufferers\nrecalled how the disease had\nblighted their lives, broken up\nrelationships, wrecked promotions\nand led many to alcohol and drugs.\nThe condition is caused by the\ninability of the body to break down\nthe compound tri methyl amine. This\nis a by-product of food digestion\nwhich smells strongly of fish.\nUsually this compound is turned\ninto an odour less substance.\nHowever, in the case of fish odour\nsyndrome sufferer, the gene that\ncontrols this conversion is faulty.\nThe result of this is that the smelly\ncompound tri methyl amine is\nsecreted in breath and perspiration.\nThis causes the fish odour.\nOn assessing whether the\ncondition was hereditary, the\nresearchers found that the condition\ncan be passed on if both the parents\nhave the faulty gene. However, if\nthis was the case, the parents would\nnot know that they carried it,\nshowing no symptoms themselves.\nIf you have any problems\nwhile at college you can talk\nin confidence to either:\nMinever Kavlak\nUnion Adviser\n1st floor,\nUnion Building\nTel: ext 3508\nDon Adlington\nStudent Counsellor\n1st floor,\n15 Princes Gardens\nTel: ext 3041\nYou can just drop in\nor if you phone beforehand you\ncan make an appointment.\nWelfare and Guidance\nSomething Smell's A Bit Fishy!\nThe deadline for submission of letters to Felix is Monday, 6pm "

    "content": "Reviews 13\nLa Boheme\nStudents nowadays know all about la vie\nboheme, if you believe the stories you see in the\npapers now and then; though I 've yet to hear of\nsomeone burning lecture-notes to keep warm.\nMyself, I like the thought, and often search the\nproperty ads for something of the form:\n'freezing garret, stove provided, bring your own\npaper and pen.'\nBut Puccini's La Boheme is a long way from\nthe Young Ones, even when the production\ncontains contemporary elements, as it does in\nSteven Pimlott's new staging for ENO.( In\nJeremy Sams' new translation, the Bohemians'\ndance routine at the beginning of Act IV\nbecomes a game of charades: 'Film, one word,'\nmimes the philosopher Colline, before wrapping\nhimself in the shower curtain.)\nFilling two-thirds of the stage are the clean\nwhite lines and columns of a Greek temple-like\nstructure which doubles as the Bohemians'\nlodgings and their local caf6. This deliberate\npartitioning seems to be the focal point of\nPimlott's vision of the work, emphasising the\nseparate ness of the un materialistic world of the\nfour artists. Otherwise this is a refreshingly\nun didactic interpretation.\nProbably the most controversial aspect of the\nproduction is the omission of intervals. The\ncurtain stays up for the full two hours, and, to\nthe advantage of the opera's musical coherence,\none scene flows straight into the next. This is\ncarefully done, and works better than you might\nexpect. The down-side is that in place of sharply\ncontrasting tableaux, a certain visual blandness\ndevelops and nothing particularly dazzles the\neye (except when Musetta takes her dress off\nand dances on the table. Is it Art? Who cares?\nWhy waste one of those rare sopranos who look\ngood in fishnets and a corset.)\nThe best reasons for catching this new\nBoheme, however, are musical. Sian Edwards\nhas clearly prepared carefully for her first outing\nas music director, but the orchestra displays\nmuch more technique. The sound is rich and\nsumptuous (only at the tragic climax to the\nfamous deathbed scene do they perhaps try too\nhard) the woodwind solos are beautifully played\nand lovingly phrased. The closing pages of Act I were luminous, only slightly marred by a missed\nnote (the only noticeable first-night fluff) from\nRoberta Alexander's Mimi. Hers is an apt and\ntouching portrayal of the consumptive heroine;\nno two-cylinder Tosca, but a genuinely\nunaffected flower girl who makes the most of\nPuccini's soaring melodies, although her fluttery\nvibrato may not be to everyone's taste. And\nvolume is not a problem, as it sometimes is with\nJohn Hudson's pleasant-voiced Rodolfo. Cheryl\nBarker is gusty rather than radiant in Musetta's Act II aria; Jason Howard's Marcello is rich and\nfirm. The four principals combine together\nbeautifully in the affecting Act III quartet,\nperfectly balanced here, in which Rodolfo and\nMimi are reconciled while Marcel and Musetta\nquarrel. There are no weak links in the rest of\nthe cast, and outstanding is Donald Adams who,\nin the cameo role of Benoit, steals the landlord\nscene.\nEven if nothing else, you'll leave the theatre\nwith the salutary thought that while beer is\nexpensive and your grant miserly, at least you've\ngot the NHS.\nPatrick Wood.\nIn rep at the Coliseum, St Martin's Lane, until\nOct 27th.

Even more\ndisturbing, he is described on the cover as \"the\nauthor of many fantasy novels\", and a \"practising Celtic musician\". Oh dear. The\nwords 'pretentious' and 'shite' suggest\nthemselves to me. But, conscientious critic that I am, I muddle through the 650-odd pages just for\nyour benefit.\nOne the bright side, at least I can save some\nof you a big mistake. This is the sort of book\nyou give to the relative you really detest. You\nknow the one, we've all got one; it's the law.\nGive them this book and watch them squirm and\npretend they actually understand the plot.\nThe only reason I kept on reading was\nbecause there was a character called Felix and I kept hoping he was going to turn into an\namusing student paper.\nIn conclusion I recommend castration for the\nauthor and twenty years to life for the\npublishers.

However, in between the fantasies she\nwrites pages of analysis on these sexual\nthoughts and this detracts from the enjoyment of\nthe book.\nHer first book 'My Secret Garden' is a better\nread because the fantasies seem less made-up\nand Ms Friday hadn't found it necessary to write\npages about them, which, unless you are into\npsychology, are a bit of a waste of time.\nDon't get me wrong, though, I did enjoy the\nbook, with its fantasies from bestiality (goats,\nsheep and dogs!) to lesbianism to incest but I'd advise you to read either 'My Secret Garden' or\n'Women On Top' first.\nJane\nPublished by Arrow\nPrice: \u00a38.99 (paperback)\nCatspaw\nby Joan D. Vinge\nCat is a renegade, outcast for his partly alien\ngenes. He is also a telepath crippled by guilt.\nKidnapped by a huge transport\nconglomerate, he is then coerced into protecting\nthe aunt of his former love.\nThe aunt, altruistic political puppet of the\ntransport company, is thought the target of the\ndrug cartel she platform against. With his\nmental powers temporarily restored by hugely\nillegal drugs, Cat thwarts an assassin and goes\nin search of the killer.\nCatspur is not stock 'dark future' Sci Fi, nor\nfortunately, is it 'Cyberpunk', containing\nelements of both but avoiding arrogance and\nimmaturity. Also unusual is the fact that the\nhero is a whole person with a history instead of\nan empty face.\nOverall Catspur is decidedly different, highly\nrecommended!\nHouse\nPublished by Meridian\nPrice: \u00a34.99 (paperback)\nLook out for a review of the autumn season of films next week\n\n"

Born on 2nd November\n1934, Sir Oxburgh is married with\nthree children. He has distinguished\nhimself on both the academic and\nadministrative sides of science and\neducation, being a Geology\ngraduate from University College,\nOxford, and having been elected to\nthe Fellowship of the Royal Society\nin 1978.\nIn 1978, Professor Oxborough\nwas awarded the Professorship of\nMineralogy and Petrology at\nCambridge University and went on\nto become Head of the Department\nof Earth Sciences in 1980. During\nthe 1980s, he became President of\nQueens College, Cambridge, and\nreceived a visiting Professorship of\nCornell University in 1986.\nA major change in direction of\nProfessor Oxburgh's career took\nplace in 1988, when he was\nappointed Chief Scientific Advisor\nto the Ministry of Defence, a post\nthat he held until coming to\nImperial College.\nProfessor Sir Ronald Oxburgh\nreplaces Sir Eric Ash, who after\neight years as Rector, has seen the\ncollege through thick and thin.\nSir Eric gained his PhD at\nImperial College in 1952 and went\non to do research at Stanford\nUniversity, California. Following\nthis, he spent nine years at Bell\nNorthern. Following his time there,\nSir Eric returned to the United\nKingdom as a lecturer and then\nhead of Electronic and Electrical\nEngineering at University College,\nLondon, until becoming Rector of\nImperial College in 1985.\nIn addition to Sir Ronald\nOxburgh's start of office, two of\nthe college's Constituent Colleges\nhave new Deans. The new Dean of\nthe City and Guilds College, former\ncollege tutor, Professor Julia\nHiggins, and the new Dean of the\nRoyal College of Science,\nProfessor John Pendry, began their\nterms of office on 1st October.\nSir Ronald Oxburgh, the new Rector of Imperial College\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE STUDENT TELEPHONE\nSERVICE\nPersonal Authorisation Code (PAC)\n10% Less than BT Payphones\nLocal, National & International Calls\nNo Standing or Enrolment Fee\nMonthly item is ed billing\nNEW additional 5% off for Favourite\nNumber plan\n\u2022n Now available from Beit, Linstead,\nSouthside & Weeks Halls\nSign up at the Freshers Fair\nor ring Freephone 0800 100 222\nA SUPERIOR\nHANGOVER\nwith\nHANK'S STUDENT CARD!\n195 Kings Road, Chelsea SW3 491 Fulham Road, Fulham SW6\n54 Abingdon Road, Kensington W8\nCARD NO. 2890 VALID TO 7/94\nA STUDENT'S DREAM!!\nNEVER ENDING HAPPY HOUR\nAND DISCOUNTED FOOD\n\n"

    "content": "Clubs and Societies 27\nWhat's That Noise?\nWhile travelling through Essex, Huile Desardine encounters the noise of the\nJazz & Rock Club Chairman, Andrew Booker and is fidgeting to know more.\nWhat could the Jazz & Rock Club possibly have to offer anybody ?\nSomewhere up the gentle valley of the\nBlackwater there can be heard the sound of\ndrumming. Nothing loud, but on a warm July\nevening the sound of drumming may easily\nannoy people, particularly in such a quiet Essex\nvillage. It comes from the upper quarters of a Georgian house, half surrounded by trees. After\nlistening for some minutes I am furnished with a measure of intrigue and suspicion. I walk up the\ndrive and ring on the doorbell.\nTo my surprise, the drumming stops\ninstantly. Seconds later somebody is bounding\ndown the stairs. The door opens and a young\nman greets me.\nI explain that I was passing through the\nvillage and was fascinated by his drumming. He\nseems not to care in the slightest who I am.\nInstead, he offers me wine and invites me in to\nlisten more closely. We ascend to his attic and I insist he continue as he would with no audience.\nMy presence affords him no discomfort, for\ntwenty minutes later he is still playing the same\nthing. After thirty-four minutes of, he tells me, a combination of three, four and seven beat cycles,\nI dare to suggest that this might be a bit of a waste of time?\n\"No, I don't think so. OK, I 'll probably never\nfind a use for it at college, but it all helps one\nway or another.\"\nCollege? Which?\n\"Imperial.\" As if I'm likely to meet someone\nfrom my own college. In Essex. We marvel at\nthe coincidence. Is he musical at college?\n\"I'm chairman of the Jazz & Rock Club.\"\nTwo months later I return upon invitation. It\nseems a small matter of days since I was here\nlast, but things have changed. Most noticeably\nthere is silence.\nI inquire as to what he has been up to since\nlast we met. I discover that he has not sampled\nthe customary student vacation al diet of work\nexperience. Never has.\n\"I think I'm just young enough to carry on\nthe school holiday scheme of things. Anyway I don't sit around doing nothing all day.\"\nThis is in fact true. His time is divided\nbetween wine-making and musical activities.\nOnly yesterday, he was rehearsing with\nSilverscreen, who will be appearing at the first\nJazz & Rock gig in Imperial College Union on\n14th October. His musical attentions were\nmanifest on my first visit but now, in the kitchen\nalone, there are almost thirty gallons of\nunfinished wine. He shrugs it off as a \"bit of a waste of electricity, sometimes,\".\nI ask him about the Club: the vehicle for non-classical players to rehearse and perform, the\npractice room under Biology and Beit Hall, the\nnot-so-occasionally appalling bands every other\nThursday night - this well-mannered, musical\nand viti cultural rustic is in charge of all that.\nSo these bands - are they really no good? We\nrecall at this juncture an article by the Jazz &\nRock Club which appeared in the final issue of\nFelix last year containing, rather than a summary\nof the club's activities, an invitation to throw\nrotten vegetables and general abuse at any of the\nbands people didn't like. There is jovial\nacknowledgement, but he has not changed heart.\n\"In my opinion, if people don't go to a gig,\nit's not because they're being apathetic or lazy,\nit's because they don't like the band. Sometimes\nthere are twice as many people in the bar who\nstay there because they don't want to listen.\"\nWouldn't that be his fault for putting the\nbands on in the first place?\n\"Well, I'm easily convinced. Anyway, I don't like to think of anybody being at fault. The idea\nis to let them play so that they improve. The\ntrouble is that some of them don't give a stale\nbogie about... whatever areas need improving.\nSo what's he going to do about it?\n\"Nothing. Buy a few more mikes maybe, get\na few people in who like sound gear. Otherwise\nlet it carry on as normal. I came into this club to\nplay music, not piss about with technical rubbish\nthe whole time. I want to do something that\ndoesn't revolve around how good the PA is.\"\nIn fact, these days he is more often to be\nfound playing on the piano than the drums.\nSo what exactly is this 'something else'?\n\"I'd like to try and attract a few non-rock\nmusicians; people who are more into what notes\ncome out of their instrument than what amplifier\nthey're going through. I think a lot either get\nscared off by pure rock types, or lose interest\nbecause it's all bands and equipment and gigs,\nwhen all they want is some kind of organised\nmusical activity.\"\nIf he can render enough people interested,\nthis is what they'll get. Since my first visit he\nhas begun and finished his latest formal\ncomposition, which explains the silence of the\ndrums. It takes the form of a suite in four\nmovements, lasting over half an hour.\nThe intention is to present it in a setting as far\nremoved from the traditions of a Jazz & Rock\ngig as possible, allowing for a more diverse and\nultimately larger audience.\n\"I'm after as many people as possible to\nmake up the ensemble, mainly guitars, but also\nany other real instrument. I want to cater for a few more people this time. Those that want to go\noff and form bands are welcome to play at the\ngigs. Those that can't see themselves in a rock\nband for whatever reason can come and play in\nthe biggie if they want. Hopefully we'll perform\nin the Great Hall or something.\"\nI take a look at the score. I can't understand\nany of it, but he insists it is not as complicated as\nit looks. I am struck by the possibility that a major flaw in his ideal has been overlooked. Can\nguitarists read music?\n\"I don't think so. But that shouldn't put\npeople off. Some of the parts are quite repetitive,\nso that won't be a problem. I'll need a few\npeople who can read just to keep the thing going,\nalthough they don't need to be guitarists.\nHe likes to think the ensemble will be a learning experience, mainly for himself. He\nadmits he has really no idea of the range of\nabilities he will attract.\n\"The biggest problem is that this kind of\nmusic-making process is exactly what a lot of\nmembers are trying to avoid - it's just not rock\nmusic. Really I'm looking for non-rock players.\"\nWith that, the Jazz & Rock Club Chairman\ngoes to the piano, plays a few principal chords,\nand finishes on one which spans three octaves\nand requires seven fingers.\nSee Jazz & Rock every other Thursday night in the Ents Lounge\n\n"

Enter Mr Solares, a wooer of Mrs Cuevas, who persuades her to\nmarry him; Lionel, a sales-type person who falls\nin love with Molly and Vivian, a hyperactive\nchild who stays for a while. The result is a brilliantly structured and very deep story that is\nsurprisingly light hearted on many occasions.\nThe cast masterfully play their characters,\nespecially Dana Ivey as Mrs Constable who\nplayed one of the most convincing drunkards I have ever seen. Others to note were Rosemary\nHarris (Mr Cuevas), Robin Weaver (Vivian) and\nRoland Curram (Mr Solares).\nAn engrossing and meaningful play that will\nmake you laugh, think, laugh some more, think\nsome more and then applaud loudly.\nHarry\nLyric Hammersmith until Oct 9th.

Mike McShane in 'Exact Change' is\nthe next production by the Lyric; so book now!\nBohemian\nLights\nThe Gate's refurbishment into as wish y style\ntheatre complete with air conditioning and\ncomfy seats marks a new era for a renowned\ntheatre.\nBut the renown has been tarnished with a crude and truly awful adaptation of a Spanish\ncomedy that demands the execution of the\nadaptor, David Johnston.\nHe chose to set the play in Dublin and\nsurround the story with Irish politics, Irish\nhistory, Irish accents, Irish gratuitous swearing\nthat sounds mis-placed and a couple of talented\nviolinists added, I think, to enhance the already\nIrishness of the play.\nThe result, despite a clever and atmospheric\nset, is a comedy that now becomes depressing\nand morbid. Setting it in Ireland was a mistake.\nAny comedy is soon asphyxiated by the Irish\npolitics/history.\nThe story is of a old, blind poet who wanders\nthe streets one night after 'obtaining' a large\nsum of money and then dies later. He encounters\nvarious low-lifes that are either selling sex,\nalcohol or both and he also gets thrown into\nprison for good measure.\nTony Rohr, as the main character, adds to the\nmorbid ness with his role as the poet. He\nswitches from acting like a true blind man in one\nsentence to acting like a normal 20:20 vision\nblok e who is simply wearing dark glasses.\nThe other characters seem false as well. Is\nthis to do with bad acting, bad research, or the\npossible fact that the entire Irish culture, as seen\nby the adaptor, is some sort of lie, or full of lies?\nI have not got the answer to this question, but\nI would love to have it. In the mean time, I will\nhave say that you must visit the Gate Theatre\nbecause it is now a sexy place.

There is no way of\naccurately describing the feeling of swimming in\nand out of the decks of these grand old ships,\nmany of which fought at Jutland.\nDisorientation was not a problem in the\n'upper' decks even\nthough the walls, ceilings\nand floors had swapped\nplaces. None of our\ndivers ventured very\ndeep into the hulls as,\nwithout careful planning\nand preparation, it is all\ntoo easy to get lost in the\nLooking up, whirlpools\nand waterfalls, caused\nby the tide pouring\nthrough the open\ndue to the mass of their armaments and\nsuperstructure.\nWe descended onto the broad expanse of\ntheir keels and, from there, down the sides to the\nsea bed and the 'lower decks'. The weight of the\nvessels compacted the superstructure into the\nseabed, so that it was possible to dive into the\nwreck and down below\nthe mud. None of our\ngroup found the need to\ntry this as there were\nenough sights and\nplunder in easy access.\nThe former included the\nofficers bathroom with\nthe bath and fittings\ncorridors and kicked-up lln fr l1av mills f hp VPPn clearly visible through\nsilt dramatically reduces ri u, iL,ruz a,Ll/ W lU(/C oc ch. the portholes. For the\nvisibility. Even so the\nbridges and radio rooms, where some of the\nfittings still remain, were fully accessible. Gun\nturrets were open and the mechanisms still\nvisible, encrusted with wild life. It seemed that\nevery gun breech had its own edible crab living\nin it as well as a cloak of dead mans fingers and\nother anemones growing over it.\nOnly three Dreadnought-size battleships\nremain, the Koenig, the Kronprince Wilhelmand\nand the Markgraf. All of which lie in over 40\nmetres of water. These leviathans 'turned turtle'\nport hc latter we collected parts\nof the teak decking and a cleat from one of the\nlaunches, all lying conveniently on the sea floor.\nThe block ships are all situated in the\nentrance to the flow and, with the exception of\nthe Inverlane, must be dived when the current is\nslack. The state of preservation of these vessels\nvaries, but they all have one thing in common.\nThey are all teaming with wildlife, from\nhundreds of baby edible crabs, through to legal\nsized lobsters and on to large and moody conga\neels. Souvenirs, like brass tobacco boxes dated\nChristmas 1914, can be found with a bit of\nrummaging and luck.\nThe Inverlane deserves a separate mention as\nshe lies only half submerged, thus the tidal flow\ncan give a five foot height difference in the sea\non either side of her. We entered via the deck\nand swam though the crystal clear waters of her\nholds and corridors, admiring the profusion of\ncolours displayed by the anemones on the walls.\nLooking up, whirlpools and waterfalls, caused\nby the tide pouring through the open hatches,\ncould be seen.
