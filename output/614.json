A farmer has a field which\nhe wants to divide into five congruent fields for\nhis five sons etc. etc. etc.\nI must admit to not liking dissection puzzles\nvery much. They're mostly far too difficult for\nanyone less patient than Job, and those which\naren't tend to require an intuitive leap before\nthe solution suddenly becomes obvious.\nThis week's puzzle, one of the few\ndissection puzzles that I find really entertain-ing, falls into the latter category. Some solvers\nwill make the logical jump very easily, and will\nfind the puzzle on the easy side; others, I promise, will not!\nThe first diagram shows how a square with\nthe corner removed can be dissected into five\ncongruent shapes. If the corner less square is\nhalved along a diagonal, the resulting shape\ncan also be divided into five congruent pieces,\nas shown in the second diagram. The third\ndiagram does the same feat on an equilateral\ntriangle with the corner missing. This week's puzzle is to dissect an un mutilated square into\nfive congruent shapes. There is a unique\nsolution.\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office, please. \u00a35 (donated by the ever-generous Mend-a Bike) for the correct\nsolution randomly selected at 1:00pm next\nWednesday.\nLast Week's Solution\n20 padlocks are needed. For any three\nmembers of the Exec, there is at least one key\nthey lack; and since everyone else has that\nmissing key, every subset of three Exec\nmembers is associated with a different key\nwhich the v don't have. So there are at least6 C3 keys, i.e.20 padlocks are necessary.\nBut 20 locks are also sufficient. Take each\nsubset of three Exec members in turn, and\n'give everyone except them the key to one of\nthe locks. This satisfies the cond it in s of the\npuzzle and needs 20 locks.\nKen Morison, Chem Eng PG, was the only\none to get it right, but honorable ment in goes\nto Gary Smith who de sci bed a method of\nlocking Mike in a box so that four people are\nneeded to open it. His method uses fourteen\npadlocks, but since it needs a box as well I felt\nKen Morison's solution rather more sound.\nFriday, May 14\n\u2022Baha'i Soc AGM,12:30 pm, Brown Com m Rm.\n\u2022Soup Run, 10:30pm, Falmouth Kitchen.\nSaturday, May 15\n\u2022Rag Fete, 2:00pm, Queens Lawn.

By this stage, we had bought two new 'body stockings' for\nthe female Latin-American dancers, which were rather daring to say the\nleast, so with these, the new hairdos, and Vicky's specially-dyed pink\nshoes, the female side of the team at least felt well-prepared for what was\nto come.\nAt the Guildhall, the enormous ballroom meant that seventeen couples\ncould all dance at once\u2014though the sprung floor did take some getting\nused to!\nOnce again, our ballroom couples did well: Melanie and Simon were\nplaced fifth in the waltz; Vicky and Allan (Logan) were placed sixth in the\nquickstep; Rebecca and Alan (Edwards) in the team for the first time,\nshowed a certain promise by getting into the second round in the jive, as\ndid Sally and Richard who were unlucky not to get further with their cha-cha routine.\nIC also entered a couple for the 'Open' competition which this year\nwas the samba. Marion and Daoud performed admirably\u2014especially\nsince Daoud had not done any dancing until he came to IC last\nSeptember.\nAfter the finals, the 'Off Beat' team event was held. This competition is\nopen to all club members, and consists of a three-minute 'sketch', the\nprize being awarded for the most original and entertaining entry. Colin\nLewis, our choreographer, had produced .a very novel and funny piece\ncalled 'The Eurovision Dance Competition' performed to Tom Lehrer's The Vatican Rag (Italy) and The Masochism Tango (Spain). This entry\nwas placed fifth.\nAs with the Southern Competition there was plenty of general dancing\nfor the spectators to stretch their legs and a Latin American demonstration by the Fletchers.\nA small aside for those in the know\nContrary to popular rumour, this year our infamous 'Miss Quickstep' did\nnot injure herself mountain climbing a few weeks before the Southern\nCompetition (like last year)\u2014rather she splint herself open sliding down a mountain on New Year's Day (much more considerate; after all it gave\nher a whole month for the bits to weld together again).\nPage 2 FELIX, May 14, 1982\n\n"

    "content": "RUSSIA mt Cricket\nRussia Dies Laughing: Jokes from Soviet\nRussia, edited by Zhanna Dolgopolova,\nAndre Deutsch \u00a34.95 (hardback).\nJoke books are usually pitiful rubbish and this\none is about as entertaining as most. But\nbecause of its theme it's on a different level from\nmost joke books, or rather it's on two levels at once. The book's designed to sell to\nthe semi-intellectual anti-Soviet market (the\nsort of people who are upset if you call\nSolzhenitsyn boring) as well as to the simple-minded (the sort of people who avidly read\nIrish joke books and the like). Apart from its\npolitical character the book is much the same\nas any other joke book, with a small proportion of good jokes filled out with trashy\njokes, large classification headings and plenty\nof blank space. There are relatively few\nreprinted jokes, I only found nine. Illustrations\nby Jak accompany about every tenth joke. Of\nthe two hundred or so jokes about fifteen or\ntwenty are actually funny and perhaps a hundred are mildly amusing. About a quarter\nof the jokes have little or no connection with\nthe USSR. Apart from the anti-Soviet jokes\nthere are jokes about student life, war, sex,\nmedicine, families, Jews and anti-Semites (a section of anti-Semitic jokes is followed by\nsome Jewish anti-anti Semitic jokes as though\nto make up for it). There are two anti-American jokes (one of them quite good).\nThis is one of the better jokes:\nBrezhnev was being conducted around\nhell. \" Well,\" the demons say to him, \"choose yourself a torment.\" They pass\nsinners sizzling in giant frying pans. \"What\nabout that one?\" ask the demons. \" Nn no...\" says Brezhnev, trembling. \" Not that\none.\" They go on and see sinners being\nbeaten with burning brands. \"What about\nthat?\" ask the demons. \"Nn no...\" says\nBrezhnev, trembling. \" Not that.\" They go\nfurther and suddenly they see Krushchev in\nbed with Brigitte Bardot. \"That's the one I want,\" cries Brezhnev. \" Ha ha ha!\" laugh\nthe demons.\" That' s Brigitte Bardot' s torment.\"\nA more typical example:\nHow do you relate to the Soviet govern-ment?\nLike a wife: part habit, part fear, and wish\nto God I had a different one.\nMany of the jokes aren't really jokes at all,\nthey're just meant to make you reflect on\nSoviet (especially Stalinist) faults. Some of\nthem are quite thoughtful, like this one which\nis probably meant as a sort of miniature parable of Soviet history:\nStalin, Kru sch che vand Brezhnev are\ntravelling in a train. The train breaks down.\n\" Fix it!\" orders Stalin. They repair it but the\nHockey\n\" I say Carruthers, dashed good wheeze of\nyours, coming to see this match.\" \"Chute, damned exciting stuff, Presidents\nXI getting a good past in', Coates worth showing off as usual. Reminds me of that\nnever to be forgotten game in er \"\n\" Ah yes, well I remember the 1946 Indian tour, in the third test they missed almost as\nmany chances as young G arms in the first\nhalf today.\"\n\" I must admit, we must be getting a bit\ndesperate when we have to rely on Geoff\nAyers to put the ball under the bar for once!\"\n\" Splendid stuff, I think fitness is beginning\nto tell, judging by the way Roger Davey is\nturning blue!\"\" One all at half-time, I haven't known\nsuch excitement since Bradman's100 th test.\"\n\" Wake up Henry, they're starting again. I do believe G arms has scored.\"\n\" Don't be ridiculous, no IC centre forward\nhas scored since that never to be forgotten\ngoal by er....\"\n\" Well dash it all, he's done it again and\nBell's added another! Splendid goals, well\nplayed you chaps! I say Henry do wake up, I think Phil Webb could do with borrowing\nyour wheelchair.\"\n\" Yes, Hm, I see what you mean, rather\nwobbly on the old pins what!?\"\" Aha, there goes the final whistle, up to\nthe bar Henry, mine's a double scotch.\"\n\" I haven't heard a whistle like that since\nthe 1867 Stockton to Darlington Express.\nD' you rememberS p offer th' s68 not out\nagainst the Australians in 1902, splendid\nknock\nTeam: C. Jones, P. Butler, J. Clarke, A. Stroomer, B. Franklin, C. Riley, S. Parker, G. Ayers, T. Coatesworth, S. Beall, M. Bansal, A. Garms, A. Rao, S. Gray.\nSpecial thanks to Dr Dave Hardwick for\norganising the game and to Mrs Hardwick for an excellent tea afterwards.\nEveryone realised that a mistake had been\nmade when our beloved President said he\nwould play when asked at short notice. The rest of the team having assembled at 9:00am the skipper was given the job of dragging Mr Morton out of bed half an hour later.\nHaving lost the toss IC were inserted. Our now famous opening partnership, spurred on\nby MrS imp kin' s parents (our longest serving\nsupporters), gave us a modest start. By lunch we were 76-4 at which point the game could\nhave gone either way very quickly. IC picked\nup with scores of 55 from Clarke,29 from\nTear (no one thought he was capable) and24 from Silva. We were all out just after 4:00pm for 189.\nHaving had his first two balls for four,\nEastland was spurred on to pick up a wicket\nin the first over of Churchill's innings. IC on\nthe whole bowled fairly well and picked up wickets quite regularly in the early stages.\nWere it not for sloppy fielding and dropped catches we would probably have\nwon. The result however was a draw. Rock Minton then led the way to the bar in an\neffort to get every pissed. Best performances\nwere from Tear(4 cream eggs), Sim pk in(2 cream eggs and ch under) and Him mers( many ch under s).Team: While (Capt), Simpkin, Clarke,\nEastland, Halai, Morton, Silva, Waller, Tear,\nHinmers.\n^Badminton\nThere will be handicap badminton tournament on Saturday, May22 at 10:00a mOld Chemistry Building. Events will include mens and ladies singles, mens doubles and if\npossible, ladies and mixed doubles (numbers\npermitting). The tournament will be open to\nall members of the club and a nominal entry\nfee will be charged to help pay for shuttles\netc. To enter, sign name on club noticeboard\nin the Union or contact C.M all a band, Chemistry 2.\ntrain doesn't move. \" Shoot everyone!\"\norders Stalin. They shoot everyone but the\ntrain doesn't budge. Stalin dies. \"Rehabili-tate everyone!\" orders Krushchev. They\nare rehabilitated but still the train won't go.\nKrushchev is removed.\" Close the curtains,\" orders Brezhnev, \"and pretend\nwe're moving!\"\nThe publication of an anti-Soviet joke book\nsuggests that things can't really be all that bad\nin the USSR if they're able to make jokes\nabout it. (At least this is true of the compilers,\nidentified as \" AN, RN and KS\", an architect,\nan artist and a writer, who are probably much\nbetter off than most people in the USSR.) Joke\nbooks wouldn't be compiled by people in\nconstant fear of arrest, and the editor says in\nthe introduction that \"Brezhnev does not yet\nput people in prison for telling jokes\". (The\npublishers seem to want to give the book a more anti-Soviet slant than it really has; the\nblurb says that \" Russians who joke...are\nrunning risks we could not dream of...\") It's hard to tell if the jokes reflect any popular\ndiscontent in the USSR. The attitude of the\ncompilers seems to be sort of cynical acceptance of the Soviet system, they regard it\nand its rulers with skepticism and some contempt but they seem to see it as an unalterable fact of life. Mocking jokes wouldn't be made by people who hated their government (for example the Iranians who hated the\nShah). But being laughed at is harder to ignore\nthan being hated, and the Soviet authorities\nwould have to take reprisals on a Stalinist scale\nto stop the jokes spreading. In the West, the\npublication of this book, feeble though most of\nit is, will certainly have the effect of making the\npublic still more sympathetic to Soviet and\nEastern European dissidents. The dissidents\n(or at least some of them) are exploiting the\nfaCt that jokes are almost ir resist able, a highly\neffective way of getting people on your side, a fact which a lot of other political and semi-political movements have failed to grasp.\nN.

He admitted that the country had been going downhill since\nhe became involved in government, a view echoed by a questioner.\nHe spoke for about fifteen minutes and later answered questions for\nthirty minutes. Starting his speech, he outlined the usual Conservative\npolicy of the necessity for a sound trading base, before talking about\neducation in particular. His views were the same as those expressed by\nhis junior Minister William Waldegrave last Friday( see elsewhere).\nSir Keith was asked about overseas students, teacher training, his\n\"disastrous\" term as Minister for Social Services and later Industry,\nthe Falklands and both the quantity and quality of engineers being\nproduced by universities. However, Sir Keith was not asked any\nquestions on the future levels of student grants or loans.\nRCS Union President-Elect, Mr Karl Schmidt, and Vice President,\nMiss Fiona Owen, are covered with gung e as part of their initiation.\nThe C CU AGM s were all held on Tuesday \u2014 a report and more\npictures o^ page 3.\n\"To you, my boy, fifty million...\"\nAnd now for the facts\nMr William Waldegrave, Junior Minister responsible for Higher\nEducation addressed the Standing Conference of University\nInformation Officers at 170 Queensgate last Friday.\nHe warned the universities that remarks like \"the government is\nbringing our institution to its knees\" may well cause the public to lose\nconfidence in higher education. He recommended that universities\nwork harder on developing relationships with the local community and\nthe public at large. He included industry in the general public,\nstressing the importance of obtaining increased financial support from\nresearch contracts etc.\nWhen answering questions, the Minister said that if the current\ncutbacks meant a5% increase in external funding in fifteen years the\nwhole campaign could be viewed as a success.\nUnion President Nick Morton said that Mr Waldegrave was \" far more reasonable than his boss Sir Keith Joseph\" and was pleased that\nthe Department of Education and Science's view was gradually\nmoving toward's the Union's own view.\nNo: 614 Friday, May 14,1982 Free!\n\n"

    "content": "The most surprising release of the week must\nbe the double bill of Star Wars and The\nEmpire Strikes Back, not least because they\nare the top two selling films of all time.\nThe lack of publicity for this event is thus\nunderstandable\u2014who needs to \"sell\" films\nwhich have already been seen and enjoyed by\nmillions? Way back in May 1977 when Star\nWars was released in America, nobody\nexpected the overwhelming response which\noccurred. At first things were slow, then word\nof mouth resulted in massive queues and Star\nWars mania had struck.\nAn imperial storm trooper. The success of the film was probably a greater shock to 20th Century Fox; the film\ncost $10m and has grossed a staggering'\n$185m. The 'sequel' it spawned (which writer:\nGeorge Lucas had planned well before Star\nWars was filmed) The Empire Strikes Back\nscaled new heights in movie technology and\nturned out to be an effects epic (which was\nequally enjoyable) and grossed $135m on an\ninvestment of $22m. It is not surprising,\ntherefore, that the third film in the series\nRevenge of the Jedi (which will cost $32.5m)! has already started filming and will be released,\nin May 1983. I Well, figures apart, what else is impressive;\nabout these giants of the screen? The stories\nare undeniably simple; in Star Wars a young\nfarm boy( Luke Skywalker) is lured away from\nhis home by the promise of adventure and in\nEmpire his fight against evil begins in earnest.\nBoth, however, are filled out with a selection of\nunusual characters and machines which just\nabout manage to raise them above the average\nspace soap opera.\nAlthough George Lucas chose unknowns\nfor the main roles in Star Wars, he managed to\npersuade Sir Alec Guiness and Peter Cushing\nto take roles, which un doubt ably raised the\ngeneral standard of acting. They were also a reasonably good bet to ensure moderate box\noffice success at least. However, these\ncharacters were almost totally overshadowed\nby the two androids R2-D2 and G3PO (who\nprovided an absurd comic element) and the\nmagnificent Darth Vader. For me, Vader steals\nthe show time after time\u2014there seems to be\nsomething appealing about evil incarnate and\nhis external appearance adds much to that\nappeal.\nOur hero gs on the bridge of the Millenium Falcon\nBut the most important breakthrough was\ncertainly not the character is ation. The most\namazing step forward was un doubt ably the\nextensive use of ingenious special effects. By\nnow you're probably groaning at the mention\nof the words \"special effects\" as the horde of\nimitators that Star Wars prompted has meant\nthat you can hardly watch a film which hasn't got lasers or enhanced glows somewhere in it.\nBut this is where Star Wars broke new ground\nand is where the appeal of the film lies. The\nconvincing space scenes, tumbling spacecraft,\nwell designed ships and costumes together\nwith excellent sound effects results in a \"look\"\nwhich initially overcomes any shortcomings in\nthe plot or acting. Without this customised\n\"look\" Star Wars (and certainly Empire) would\nbe nothing more than a shoddy space western.\nAnyway, in terms of enjoyment, both films\nscore very highly and I 'll be first in the queue to\nsee them again for the umpteenth time on the\nbig screen, where both should be seen. Oh\nyes, I didn't mention that Star Wars has been\nsold to ITV for about $5m and should be seen\nat Christmas.\nMark Smith\nTunnels Under London by Nigel Pennick.\nPrice \u00a31.20 by post from Electric Traction\nPublications, 142 Pheasant Rise, Bar Hill,\nCambridge CB3 8SD.( Only available\ndirect from publishers.)\nNigel Pennick has written a very well\nresearched book detailing tunnels built under\nLondon for underground railways, roads, air-raid shelters, telephone networks and nuclear\nbunkers. All the information has been\ngathered from public sources and piecemeal ed together with plausible deductions to fill in the\ngrey areas. Considering the now well-known\nGPO cable tunnels being clandestinely built by\nthe Government and not admitted to, the\nsubject matter is naturally contentious and\ndifficult to research. London is possibly the\nonly major city in the world with an\nunderground network of tunnels that remains\npractically undocumented for the public. Mr\nPennick's small (28 page) book is the next best\nthing in the absence of official literature.\nWritten almost in the manner of a scientific\npaper Tunnels Under London quotes its\nsources continuously and distinguishes fact\nfrom theories. Consequently, the book is\nseriously written and is believable. Well worth\nbuying by anyone interested in the tube\nsystem, or esoteric literature, or both.\nS. Marshall\nPage 8 FELIX, May 14, 1982\n\n"
