Professor Sir David\nWeatherall, speaking in advance\nof next week's British Association\nannual meeting in Keele, said\nyoung people are blaming science\nfor environmental problems, and\nare frightened by the \"Jurassic\nPark\" image of genetic\nengineering.\nSir David's comments came as\nthe Government was urged to\nmake science 'more sexy' in\nschools.

He\nadded his concern \"for university\nautonomy, but not for the unions\nthemselves\". The former minister\nadded that, if there was a vote in\nthe House of Commons, he expects\nto be joined in the opposition\nlobby by other Tory rebels. \"The\nGovernment has a small majority,\"\nsaid Mr Jackson. \"It would only\ntake six or eight Conservative\nMPs to vote against it.\"\nWith a majority in the\nCommons of seventeen, the\nGovernment can be defeated if\nnine of its MPs vote with all the\nopposition parties. Mr Jackson's comments now make defeat on\nvoluntary membership possible, as\nboth Labour and the Liberal\nDemocrats say they will oppose\nthe proposals to split student\nunion funding into core and non-core areas (for more details on the\nproposals and their implications,\nsee the article on page 6).\nThe developing revolt is being\nmonitored with alarm by\nministers at the Department for\nEducation, who have already been\ndefeated once this year in a House\nof Lords vote on university\nautonomy. Junior education\nminister Baroness Blatch, who\nthen announced the scrapping of\nplans to extend the powers of\nEducation Secretary John Patten,\nis said by Conservative sources to\noppose the student union reforms.\nThis is yet another problem for\nthe beleaguered Mr Patten, who\nreturned to work this week after\nrecovering from a mystery viral\ninfection. The Education\nSecretary told the Conservative\nPart conference in November\n1992 that the \"NUS closed shop\nmust go, and soon\". Mr Patten,\nand higher education minister,\nTim Boswell, are being lobbied by\nthe National Union of Students\nand Conservative Student, once\ntrenchant supporters of voluntary\nmembership. New Conservative\nStudents chairman, Tim Keevan,\nis understood to have submitted a paper to Mr Boswell, expressing\nconcern that too many clubs and\nsocieties will be killed off by the\nGovernment plans. The\nGovernment has now extended the\nconsultation period to 1st November, closing off any change\nof legislation being detailed when\nMPs return after their summer\nholidays.\nSee page 6 for an article on the Student Union Reforms\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nStudent Union Reform\nAndy Wensley, Imperial College Union President, gives his personal view on\nthe government's Student Union Reform and its implications.\nIs it fine to give students Ovaltine for tea but not\nfor them to campaign against drug abuse? How\ndoes one you distinguish between political and\nbeneficial activities?\nSuch a question arose in the parliamentary\ndebate on student union reform. These reforms\ncould drastically alter life in further education\nestablishments. But what are they and what\nimplications do they have for the students?\nThe Government's View\nThe current government has long been\ncommitted to trade union reform. Trade unions\nwork as 'closed shops' where you have no\nchoice as to whether you join. This principle is\ndriving the current student union reforms; you\nshould have the choice as to whether you join.\nThe government, in their words, aims to give\nstudents the power to choose what involvement\nthey want. Simultaneously they believe that tax\npayers should not be expected to fund student\nunion activities that are unaccountable, either\nfinancially or democratically, or which\nrepresent essentially political activities. In the\nparliamentary statement on the reform, the\ngovernment stressed that they must protect\nstudents, as well as their societies, from\nvictim is ation. The Reform\nThe reform would take place in three parts:\n(i) It would limit the purposes for which an\ninstitution can pass public sources money\nto its student union. Students would have\naccess to a 'core' of campus services. The\nparent institution could support these with\npublic funds. All other union activities\nwould be funded on a voluntary opt-in\nbasis.\n(ii) Campus unions could not use public funds\nto affiliate to national campaigning\norganisations, such as the National Union\nof Students (NUS). If they wished to\naffiliate to such an organisation, they\nwould have to be funded through private\nsources.\n(iii) Thirdly, the reform aims to make student\nunions more accountable and fully\nrepresentative. This would involve\nfinancial and democratic accountability\nand the development of codes of practice\ngoverning campus union behaviour.\nCore Campus Services\nThe government has defined these as being:\n\u2022Internal Representation\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Welfare\n\u2022Catering\nInternal Representation\nThis would include a seat on the Governing\nBody and on academic, residential and financial\ncommittees. Public money could fund:\n(i) a proportion of the salaries of elected\nsabbaticals involved in these affairs.\n(ii) the conduct of elections of sabbatical and\nnon-sabbatical officers\n(iii) the elections of non-union internal\nrepresentatives\n(iv) the preparation of welfare information.\nSports\nA large part of a student union budget is\ncurrently allocated to sports clubs. In the\nGovernment's words, further and higher\neducation establishments are likely to wish to\ninclude sporting services to be supported with\npublic funds. With this in mind, sport has been\ndefined as a core service, enabling salaries of\ncoaches and grounds men to be paid.\nWelfare\nThis covers many areas including counselling,\nhelp for disabled students, accommodation,\nlegal advice and provision for women students\nwith rape crisis centres and safe late night travel.\nInduction to university life through Freshers'\nWeek, along with other social events, would be\ncovered, along with support for specific student\ngroups, such as part-time, mature and overseas\nstudents. Help for these groups would take the\nform of social events and advice services.\nCatering\nMost campus unions operate fast food services.\nThese would be accepted as falling within core\nactivities.\nThe aims of the reform\nApart from the core definitions, the other two\nparts of the reform are clear in their aims.\nThe second part aims to stop public money\nbeing used for affiliation to campaigning\nbodies. The third part is more complicated.\nFinancial accountability is gained by\nmonitoring the use of public funds. Charges\nwould become dependant on an whether activity\nor service is core or non-core. In the case when\nit straddles both areas, a proportional amount\nwould be charged.\nDemocratic accountability would ensure that\nall campus unions have constitutions,\ndemocratic structures along with properly\nconducted elections. Elections themselves\nwould have a minimum quo racy rate of 33%\nand candidates must not stand politically.\nHow does this affect clubs and societies?\nImmediately it can be seen that any club or\nsociety that is not sporting would be in trouble.\nBut what is a sporting club?\nTraditional sports, such as rugby, hockey and\nrowing, would be core services. But what about\nall the others? Imperial College Union has some\n155 clubs. We spend 43% of our block grant on\nthem, the highest percentage in the country.\nEvery non-sporting club is currently a non-core activity. To put it bluntly, we could fund\nour rowing teams but not our orchestra. There\nwould exist a provision to fund our overseas\nclubs under the welfare umbrella, but their\nactivities may be curtailed. Other clubs facing\nfunding cuts are the political clubs.\nAdditional costs\nA possibly more important implication of this\nreform is the cost of a core and non-core\nsystem. Currently, Imperial College Union,\nfunds sabbatical and staff costs from a single\nbudget. With a core and non-core funding\nsystem, a cost, such as a wage, is charged\nproportionally to the relevant areas. This cross\ncharging involves more work and cost for\nadministrative and financial sections. These\ncosts have been kept as low as is possible in the\npast, since we believe that as much of Imperial\nCollege Union's block grant should go to\nstudents as is possible.\nWhat is the Union doing?\nTalks with the government, with College and\nwith other student unions, including the NUS,\nhave been taking place. What we need now is\ninput from students, especially postgraduates.\nLook out for meetings in your departments.\nOver the next few weeks, Postgraduate Group meetings will be\nheld in departments to get student views on this reform.\nIf you have any questions, the sabbaticals in the\nUnion Office will be glad to help you.\nSee back page for a photo feature on Expo '93\n\n"

    "content": "Cinema and Theatre Reviews 5\nthis is that the film is fundamentally flawed by\nits script. Part of this is because the characters\naren't as in-depth as they need to be for this sort\nof suspense and a lot of the time you just don't really care.\nApparently the film is meant to 'shock' the\naudience by exploring the single most secret\nip iji r fantasy everyone has but won't discuss:\nvoyeurism, but it never even occurs that you're\nmeant to be thinking about it. The most\nsurprising thing about the film is that after all of\nthe clips on the UB40 video, you forget that the\nfilm is actually in colour.\nPenguin\nSliver\nA thriller set in a lofty narrow apartment\nbuilding that New Yorkers call a 'Sliver', where\na succession of mysterious deaths have\noccurred. Carly 'recently ended an unhappy\nmarriage' Norris (Sharon Stone), has just\nmoved in and soon finds herself the attention of\ntwo of her neighbours: Zeke 'wealthy young\nbachelor' Hawkins (William Baldwin) and Jack\n'crime writer investigating deaths' Landsford\n(Tom Berenger). Of course Carly gets entangled\nemotionally while the suspense builds as to\nwhether either neighbour is involved in the\ndeaths.\nTo add to the great cast and director (all\nundoubtedly good in their own rights), the film\nis well paced and the cinematography is of a high standard, which is essential for a movie\ndealing with both suspense through\nclaustrophobia and the use of video monitoring\nequipment.\nThis film would love to be a 'great' film, and\nby all rights it should be. The suspense is by no\nmeans that gripping and it definitely won't have\nyou on the edge of your seats. The reason for\nRising Sun\nA murder mystery set against the backdrop of\nthe US/Japan business competition. Detective\nWeb Smith (Wesley Snipes) is 'placed' with the\nmysterious John Conner (Sean Connery) who\ninforms and instructs Smith in the ways of\nJapanese business. Conner takes the role of\n'Sem-pi' (instructor) to Smith's'Co hi'( student), as they tread the careful line between\ninvestigation and Japanese etiquette.\nThe pairing of Connery and Snipes is great\nand shouldn't be missed. If anything, Snipes is\novershadowed by the attention lavished on\nConnery's character, which is a shame because\nmost of the humour comes from Snipes, and\nsome of these are almost lost due to not caring\nenough about Snipe's character.\nOne of the most notable things about the\nfilm is that they don't make a song and dance\nabout it being based on Michael (Jurassic Park)\nCrichton novel.\nEven the complementary 'played quietly in\nthe room next door for a couple of seconds so\nwe can put it one the soundtrack' song has\nrelevance. Perhaps the best commendation of\nthe film is that it also stars Harvey Keitel, who\nhas never appeared in a bad movie.\nPenguin\nUnder the Stars\nPam Ferris (Ma Larkin in Darling Buds) and\nConnie Booth (Fawlty Towers) steal the show\nin a play about a life long understudy and a failing actress. Both characters are misfits and\nprovide a comical and slightly disturbing\ninsight to the back stage of a theatre. As they\nrehearse, you see that both of them have\nopposing views on acting. They bitch, argue a bit and know that beneath the smiles for the\npress and on stage, they would both love to\nhave the limelight with the other shamed into\nnever working again.\nThere are splendid performances from\neveryone else. Penny Morrell is worth noting,\nas well as Tyler Butterworth for his part as a put upon assistant. The voice over parts of June\nWhitfield and Patricia Routledge are highly\nunlikely choices for their roles but nevertheless\ngood. They all add to the essence of the play,\nespecially since it is in a fringe theatre.\nThe production brings the back stage to life\nand is worth seeing to learn more about the\ntheatre, without spending three years at RADA.\nPhil\nGreenwich Theatre, Charing Cross Tube.\nUntil End of August.\nBish Bash Bosh\nClub\nQuite how this show got its name is subject to\ndoubt. It is a series of satirical sketches, some\ntopical (like John Major pretending to be\nWinston Churchill) but, in a week when MPs\nwere threatened with being sent home if they\ndid not play ball, it seemed somewhat tame!\nThe show was funny, but only by the brute\nforce of having five very talented people on\nstage; what they were lacking was a really good\nscript. Many of the sketches started well but\nended so quickly that some of the audience had\ntrouble maintaining their concentration. Where\nthey did score highly was their songs. With a a pianist providing excellent accompaniment they\nparodied various styles from Whitney Houston\nto Rogers and Hammerstein.\nOverall, the show was enjoyable, but with its\ncurrent script it would be more suitable to a Silly Season replacement for Radio 4's Week\nEnding than performance on stage.\nOstrogoth\nNelley's Night Spot, Willesden Green tube)\nTickets: \u00a34 (cone \u00a33) + \u00a31 membership\nCome into Felix and see what we've got available to review\n\n"

    "content": "4 Music Reviews\nPaw\nDragline\nPaw, as you might guess from the opening riffs\non Dragline, are American and follow in a similar vein to metal acts like Soundgarden and\nAlice in Chains. The result is that songs often\nlose any melody to burst of distortion, 'One\nMore Bottle' being one example.\nIt is said that beneath the gruff exterior,\nPaw's songs are about deep emotional problems\n'Jessie' is about losing the family dog and\n'Sleeping Bag' a near death experience. Still\nmost of the time Mark Hennessy could be\nsinging about dog biscuits for all you can hear.\nThe highlight is the current single 'Couldn't Know', where the song isn't overcharged with\ntoo much power and allow the melody to flow.\nBratt Anderson\nReleased on A&M. Mary Black\nThe Holy Ground\nThe Holy Ground is the latest album release\nfrom soloist Mary Black. It owes a great deal to\nMary's Irish background, but it is not just\nanother folk album.\nMary Black is one of the best known\nmusicians to be produced from Ireland for some\ntime. She is reputedly the fastest selling female\nartist in her home country and is well\nestablished in the UK.\nThis album has no consistent style, but this is\nno bad thing. Traditional instruments are\ncomplimented by saxophone and synthesis er. My initial reaction to this was uncertainty; but\nthe mix works surprisingly well. The real\nstrength of the music is in the warmth and\nstrength of the vocals. The harmonies are truly\nbeautiful. Oh, and there are some words - more\nabout them later.\nThere are twelve tracks on this album. And\nno two sound alike. Some have a traditional feel\nwhilst others have an upbeat jazz or blues\ntempo. 'When the morning comes' provides a lively introduction to the album. It demonstrates\nthe compatibility of modern instruments;\nsoprano sax, keyboards and acoustic guitar,\nwith traditional fiddle, percussion and voice.\nNearly every track has a different writer and\nthis is matched by changes in musical\ninterpretations.\nYou could leave The Holy Ground playing in\nthe background and only notice when it ends. I did the first time. This would however, be a waste of the wealth of rich sounds.\nThe Holy Ground is an album that I enjoyed\nmore each time Listened to it. The album can\nonly grow on you more each time you listen to\nthe lyrics.\nDick\nReleased on Grapevine.\nBlack Crowes\nWho Killed that Bird\nout on your Window sill\n... The Movie\nAnd so we get a tour video, oh joy. 83 minutes\nfull with 18 tracks, as comprehensive as you\nwould desire of any band. Actually the Crowes\nmake a good show of it. The selection is shown\nin various stages of undress: Live, promo\nvideos, hand-held shaking shots, each as rugged\nand carefree as the band itself. Intros vanish\ninto Chris in interviews, or Chris swaying like\nthe breeze or even Chris doing whatever else\nyou do as a deity. It's pretty much his show.\nApart from all the songs, there's some\n'excellent' footage of extended interviews.\nFifty ways to ask the same question: \"Do you\nfight with your brother\" etc. Chris wisecracks\nhis way out of most situations with a raised\neyebrow of irony. \"Yes viewer this is what I have to put up with.\"\nIt ends with 'Sting Me' with all the crazed\nand plain strange audience in view and more\nChris, the man who inhales. Surprisingly he\ncomes across as one of the sanest frontmen in\nAmerica today, at least there's no tortured\nMessiah- hood around. He enjoys himself and\nthe Crowes kick and smoke pretty much\nwhatever they want. So far they've got away\nwith it.\nTintin\nThe Poppies\nHoneybee\nIf Danny Wilson had the 'Second Summer of\nLove', The Poppies have made the running for\nnumber 3. Honeybee is psychedelia (or a they\nsay Popadelia) for the 90's. Titles like 'Love\nTrippin'/Wondering' and 'Another Groove' are\nevidence enough.\nAlthough today's flower children have a different role, the first 60's generation non-inhaler is presently hashing up the free world\nfrom the White House and the mind expanding\nhorizons of little tablets are seen in a more\ndubious light. So enter the environment as a focus; seen in 'La De Da' and 'Mother Groove'.\n' A mushroom clouds my thoughts today' -it's nicely done. Worldwide peace is also\nencompassed aka Pepsi/Coke. Everyone's song\nis in about six languages, which renders it\nsomewhat mystifying.\nAnd whilst the second side collapses like the\nEnglish middle batting order, the first is proof\nof a firm grasp of pop sensitivity. Even a Lou\nReed cover 'All Tomorrow's Parties' is quietly\nunderplayed with a floating Rickenbacker. The\nopening two tracks, 'She is Revolution' and\n'That's What We'll Do' are the best. Clever\nhooks and well structured vocal overlays.\nYes I could be back there at Woodstock and\nthe Isle of Wight. Jimi, Janis and Tim, where\ndid you go?\nTintin\nReleased on WEA.\nliP If ll illS^ Squeeze\n3rd Rail\nFor any band to lose a member with the\nqualities of the mighty, mighty Jools Holland\nmight be considered careless. Still post their\nGreatest Hits album, Squeeze are still producing\nrecords of pop squeaky cleanness. All the loose\nends have been nipped and tucked carefully into\nplace, the melodies are bright, energetic and\nyes, this is an alright single and I hate myself\nfor saying it. The album's worth would\nprobably overpower you, like drowning in\nsyrup.\nThe b side is a Cool for Cats medley. A more shaky advertisement for their forthcoming\ntour you'd have difficulty in finding.\nTintin\nReleased on A&M. We need cinema, theatre, music and book reviewers\n\n"

The Committee of\nVice Chancellors and Principals,\nin a report published last week,\nproposed the introduction of a controversial 'graduate tax'.\nUnder the plans, students would\npay an extra 2% of their salaries\nin tax after they graduate. The\nscheme is expected to net\nbetween \u00a34000 and \u00a39000 million\nfor Government coffers, and\nindependent consultants London\nEconomics say the tax could\nfinance as much as 90% of the\ncurrent cost of higher education.\nThe plans have been\ncondemned by the Association of\nUniversity Teachers. Research\nofficer Conor Cradden said that\n\"working class students would\nsuffer most\" from the proposals.\nLabour's Tony Lloyd, ducking\nquestions about his own party's moves towards the scheme,\nwarned against \"blundering\" into\na graduate tax without \"properly\nconsidering the dangers\". A spokeswoman for the National\nUnion of Students said it was too\nearly to comment on the\nproposals. The NUS president,\nLoma Fitzsimmons, is known as a committed supporter of the idea\nbehind the tax, and argued in its\nfavour during the early stages of\nher campaign for NUS president.\nStudent Loan Raids\nBY THE NEWS STAFF\nBailiffs have been called in to raid\nthe homes of three graduates and\nseize \u00a31,100 worth of property in\norder to repay their debts.\nIn the first case of its kind, the\nStudent Loan Company asked\ncounty courts to grant search and\nseize orders to reclaim property to\nthe value of loans given to the\nthree when they were students.\nThe company has also hired\nprivate debt collectors in the\nUnited States, France, Germany\nand Canada to chase more than\n200 borrowers now living abroad.\nRon Harrison, the company's chief executive, said: \"We are\nmoving into a new phase as we\nstep up efforts to re-gain taxpayers\nmoney.\"\nMeanwhile, a survey by\nBarclays Bank shows that eight\nout of ten students ended the last\nacademic year in debt. Interviews\nwith 3,000 students in twelve\nuniversities show that student debt\nhas risen by 22% in one year.
