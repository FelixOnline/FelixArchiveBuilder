    "content": "2 FELIX WELLSOC, 7th DECEMBER\nDr. Arkold E. Bender, treasurer of the Nutritional Soc.,\nshortly to be senior lecturer at\nQueen Elizabeth CoUege.\nWorldwide Famine\nDr. Bender told a small, but soon intensely attentive audience,\nthat if homo sapiens continue to eat and multiply regardless as they\nhave done to the present day, we will be starving by the turn of the\ncentury. So convincing were the facts and figures presented\u2014one\nleft with the feeling that if something is not done soon, nuclear war\nwill seem an easy way out.\nHalf the population of the\nworld today are either malnourished or starving. Population is still increasing at a considerably greater rate than food\nproduction. Only two per cent,\nof the world's total food production crosses its frontiers (a large\nproportion of this is consumed in\nBritain) and increasing population\nis reducing the available exports.\nA GORDIAN KNOT\nEconomic, Political and Humanitarian aspects of the problem\nbind it into a veritable gord ian knot that can best be attacked on\nthe level of intelligent and whole\nhearted world co-operation. Experience has shown that even on\na comparatively small scale,\nwhere an extraordinary degree of\nconcerted effort is exerted, in this\ndirection (Mexico) the resulting\nlocal improvement is barely that\nNIGEL GRAVETTE\u2014who proposed Mike and is in charge of\nyour blood.\nwhich is urgently required on a worldwide scale. The problems n attaining this degree of concerted\neffort on a worldwide scale are\nobviously enormous.\nPROBLEMS AND ANSWERS\nPoliticians deny the masses free\nfood in the pursuit of a non-align-ment policy; Catholics walk out\nof conferences on birth control;\nthe peasant is loath to give up his\ntraditional ways. Fertilizers mean\nindustry, and marketing requires\ntransport. The problem is im-men se. The answers to a lot of the\nproblems are now at hand, but\nnot the means for implementing\nthem. The yield of the land can\nbe increased. The nutritional\nvalue of present foods can be im-proved. Hitherto unt apps d sources such as the sea and the protein\nin foliage can be utilized to their\nfull extent.\nA few interested and dedicated\npeople have shown great in-ge nuit y, but until the implications\nof the present situation are thoroughly understood by politicians,\nadministrators, and, indeed, the\npeople, little will come out of the\nideas at hand.\nD.S.V JR K. FIRST NIGHT\nDRAM. SOC Tuesday, 8th December\nRobert Bolt's\" A Man For All Seasons\" sympathetically\nexplores the relationship between Henry VIII, his court, and Sir\nThomas More. We are shown Sir Thomas More, a mild man of\nletters and art, his almost casual involvement in politics, and his\ntragic end, led to the gallows by his honesty and faith ; Hugh Frazer\nportrayed him admirably, not as a simpering intellectual, but wi ha convincing forthrightness.\nHe was backed by a strong cast\u2014Jane Watts, as his wife Lady\nAlice, was perhaps a little too bitchy, Diana Warwick as his daughter\nLady Margaret was what I expected a16 th century daughter to be.\nAntony Stevens as the King was a fair blend of randy charm and\narrogance and it is regrettable that the play did not allow us to see\nmore of him.\nUNION MEETING From page 1.\nt hods at I.C. The matter was referred to Council for discussion\nbefore the end of term.\nGRAND LARCENY Barry Mair, the Deputy President, answered charges regarding\nthe long hours expected of the\ncloakroom attendants. The rota\nthat they are now working was\ntheir own plan and, because he\nthought it far from ideal, he had\nsuggested that they only do a trial\nperiod.\nThe previous weekend had seen\ntwo cases of larceny, and it had\nbeen necessary to bring in the\nCID. A coat had been stolen\nfrom the Union cloakroom on the\nnight of the R.C.S. Smoking Concert, and a suitcase, whose contents were valued around \u00a350 (he\ndescribed as \" A case of grand\nlarceny \") was removed on Monday morning. Greater security\nmeasures were introduced immediately.0 Jewish Society favoured a payment increase. This, Mr.\nMair said, was an I.C. matter;\nthe Union did not pay the men.\nSOUTHSIDE\n\u2022Pete Walton, Southside, R.C.S. Secretary commenting on weekends in Southside, said, \" It seems\na pity to employ so many men\nfor so few coats.\" It was proposed that the pigeon-holes in the\nSouthside cloakroom be replaced\nby racks because it was possible\nthat the cloakroom was little used\nas people objected to having their\ncoats rolled up in such a fashion.\nPresident Price expressed sympathy and agreed to look into the\nmatter.\nA request was also made that\nin Southside the seat covers be\ncleaned, and that waste bins be\nplaced in the T.V. lounge in view\nof the extra litter created by the\ncoffee machine. Waste bins had\nbeen on order since the beginning\nof term.\nGRANTS, BLOOD AND\nGRANADA LAND The Union was preparing a memorandum on grants for the\nUniversity Grants Committee\nwho were coming to I.C. next\nterm-LAM LEY'S TECHNICAL & GENERAL\nBOOKS\nART MATERIALS\nDRAWTNG\nINSTRUMENTS\nSTATIONERY\nPAPERBACKS\n1, 3 & 5 EXHIBITION ROAD,\nLONDON, S.W.7 The Blood Transfusion Service\nwill be at I.C. on February 3, 4\nand 5. All donors welcome.\nMr. Tutelman, who led the\ngroup fo I.C. supporters to Manchester for University Challenge,\ncriticised the treatment given\nthem by Granada T.V. He inquired if Mr. Price had received\nany written undertaking, but the\nlatter apologised for his failure\nto bring the letter to the Meeting.\nIf the complaint were justified,\nhowever, he would write.\nHALDANE LIBRARY\n13, Prince's Gardens\nSorry! You won't find textbooks or scientific treatises in\nthis library, but you will find over\n10,000 good books of general\ninterest including all the latest\nnovels !\nAnd it's Free too !\nOpen 11\u20145.30 p.m. and\nuntil 7.0 p.m. on Tuesday\nand Thursday\nTimothy Watson merits special\nmention as the Common Man\nwho provided light relief and tried\nhis hand at everything from barman to heads man. Less attractive\ncharacters were well put over too.\nAlan Auchterlounie as the Duke\nof Norfolk, a falcon-flying noble,\nRichard Mayers as Cardinal Wolsey (a little too much of a swine,\nI think), and Michael Cope as\nThomas Cromwell, whose cold-blooded politics sent Sir Thomas\nto the block. Stephen Lloyd's Richard Rich got off to a weak\nstart, but soon showed the inadequacy and ambition required of\nhim. Oliver Espitalier-Noel as\nthe Spanish Ambassador was\nCLARIFICATION\nIn our issue of 2nd December\nwe published a reference to Rule\n3 (B)(11) of the Rules of the\nA. Sc.W. which, it has been suggested, was open to the construction that Rule 3 (B)(11) gave the\nBranch Committee power to dispense Union funds for political\nobjects at the Committee's dis-c re tion. In fact under Rule 74 only the\nExecutive Committee of the\nUnion has power to dispense its\nfunds and political expenditure\nmust come from a Special Political Fund, and can only be applied to political objects defined\nby the Trade Union Act 1913.\nIn addition we are asked by the\nBranch Committee to state that\nas a committee they have no\npolitical affiliation.\nSTOMPS ARE BACK\n\"Man, what an atmosphere\u2014\nand those chicks, too!\" A typical\ncomment at one of the South Side\nStomps last year, although of\ncourse the Jazz Club's main aim\nin running the Stomps had been\nto provide some first class jazz\nfor listening and dancing.\nNext term the stomps are back,\nthe first one being on Jan. 13th. Two, and sometimes three, bands\nwill be appearing at each stomp\nto provide a variety of types of\nmusic from basic rock jazz to the\nroaring sound of the I.C. Big\nBand and the emotional subtlety\nof the Jazz Congress.\nStart next term right by going\nto the first Stomp\u2014you won't regret it!\nAL HIGSON\nadequate but not Spanish enough.\nWilliam Roper did well as the\nangry young son-in-law. Other\nparts were played by Derek Melleney, Christopher Shelton and\nLesley Slater. The producer was\nCatherine Robins.\nThe set failed to satisfy somehow\u2014perhaps it was its extreme\nasymmetry that jarred. These are,\nhowever, only trivial criticisms\nand it is sad to report that such\nan effective production was so\nbadly supported. What support\nthere was seemed to come from\noutside I.C.I really wonder if\nI.C. students have anything better\nto do with their time?\nH.A. F. THOMPSON\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 9\nSoccer : U.L. Cup\nLate Recovery\nDestroys Woolwich\nBy R. Grundy\nI.C.5 \u2014 2 Woolwich Poly.\nOn December 5th at Harlington, I. C.1st XI managed to shed\nat least a little light on the grey, murky afternoon when they beat a competent Woolwich Polytechnic side in the first round of the 'U.L. Cup Competition. This was an impressive display by I.C. and the\nteam should do well if the defence can learn to settle down a little,\nearlier in the game.\nIn the first half, the home team\nstrove in vain to make any imp res sion, and the defence was continually tested by the opposition's ability to make very good use of\nthe through ball on the slippery\nsurface. Indeed, the s bak y defence eventually cracked when\nslack tackling allowed the Woolwich inside-forward to run the\nball twenty five yards before\nshooting past Ingram.\nSurprisingly, Woolwich increased their lead within minutes\nfrom a somewhat similar situ a tion. The I.C. defence again failed\nto clear and the Woolwich centre-forward managed to screw the\nball into the corner of the net.\nLittle was seen of the I.C. attack\nat this stage; with Huxtable fighting a lone battle \" up front,\"\nlittle headway could be made.\nCHANGED SIDE After the interval, I.C. reappeared as a changed side and\nopened their account immediately : a throw-in found Eastell\nin the inside-right position and his\ncentre to the far post was headed\nhome by Vaughan. This goal\ninspired I.C. to signs of former\ngreatness and the v proceeded to\nplay some delightful football, the\ndefence linking up well with the\nforwards. I.C. drew level when\nthe tireless Vaughan shrugged off\nt wb tackles and squared the ball\nfor Eastell IO score off the lefthand post.\nThe trio of Huxtable, Vaughan\nand Stoddart, on the right then\nruthlessly crushed all hopes for\nWoolwich, by this time a sadly\ndispirited side.\nTwice, Stoddart's centres were\narrogantly turned into the net by\nHuxtable. I.C. appeared to slack\noff a little after this spate of goals\nand Woolwich were allowed to\nregain some of their former poise,\nbut the defence, and some dubious tackling by Fairholme, Griffith and Basnet nad at last\nmastered the through ball.\nAlmost on the stroke of time\nwhen fog made the game difficult\nto follow, the ever-unquenchable\nVaughan found himself eight\nyards out with his back to the goal.\nOnly this ebullient Welshman\ncould have back-heeled the ball\nwith such a mixture of professionalism and the comic.\nTeam :\nIngram, Fairholm, Basnet,\nHunt, Griffith, Johnson,\nStoddart, Vaughan, Huxtablc,\nEastell, Batcup.\nRowing\nThis term has been one mainly\nof technique coaching, leading\nup to the U.L. Winter VIII's Regatta for the junior and novice\ncrews which was held on Sat. Dec\n5th. As a result of last year's successes, the I.C. crews had to compete in events of a higher stan-dard. In all races the College\ncrews lost narrowly to the winners\nand/or the losing finalists, who\nIN TOUCH\nOn Sports Writing\nIn the opinion of the Sports Editor, these jew columns should\npresent reports and features that make informative and interesting\nreading to the whole spectrum of readers of Felix. Surely this part\nof the paper is serving little useful purpose if say, the hockey players\ncannot find anything to interest them except rushing through the\nhockey report looking for their own names.\nThe main trouble with reports at the moment is that they tend\nto be too general:\n\" The Club expects a very successful season \" or\n\" After the interval eI. C. fought back brilliantly.\"\nPlatitudes like this are dull and hardly informative. One of the\nreasons for this defect is probably that it is the captains of the clubs\nwho write the reports. Most of them have enough to do anyway and\nby the time they get round to writing, all the details are forgotten.\nThe policy of the Swimming Club is to be recommended. A specific member of the club is made responsible for submitting reports\nand when he attends matches, a mental note, at least, is made of\nideas and details for his next report. Surely every club has at least\none member eager to see his words (slightly edited perhaps) in print.\nAnd photographers would be welcomed with open arms.\nYet, reports of matches alone do not make a very impressive\nsports page, Feature-type articles are desperately needed, reflecting\nopinions, argue ment s etc. in the various clubs.\nHowever, the Sports Editor would like to thank members of all\nthe Clubs who have submitted reports this term, there has never been\na lack of copy. Next term it is hoped to take some \" recreational \"\nactivities under the wing of these columns; viz. Billiards and Snooker,\nChess. Glidina, Ski and Ten-Pin Bowling.\nin the junior events were the\nregular 1st VIII's of U.C. and\nGuys Hospital. After only nine\nweeks' rowing experience, the\nI.C. Novice crew did very well to\nhold the winners, Kings 2nd VIII\nto one length after a very close\nrace. These crews obviously have\na deal of ability and more extensive training should bring some\ngood results in the near future.\nAt the end of term, the I.C. crews will be taking part in the\nThames Plum Pudding Race and\none should then be able to judge\nthe abilities of the two senior\nVlII's who have not yet raced.\nJudo\n\"Maitta\" - Brum\nDeclare to l.C. On Sat. Dec. 5th., the Judo\nClub completed this term's fixtures with two matches against\nBirmingham University. As the\nopposition was not exo ec ted to\nwarrant taking a full it te u m,I.C. competed with what amounted to an \" A\" team. The newcomers to the 1st team, were D. Eccles and T. Vickers. Both\nfought well and the former recorded a convincing win in the\nfirst contest which I.C. won 4-2J. In the second contest, Krikor and\nC. Cohen were outstanding for\nI.C. and largely responsible for\nthe 4-1 victory.\nAfter nine weeks of successful\ncompetition, the general moral of\nthe Club is high and the teams are\nlooking forward to the InterCollegiate Championship of Gt.\nBritain next February. It is hoped\nthat last year's victory will be re-peat ed. Rifle Club\nON TARGET\nThe Rifle Club is quietly shooting itself into prominence despite\nthe lack of a range of its own.\nThe \" A\" team has beaten\nQMC and Kings and drawn with\nBattersea, and now leads Div. 1\nin the Engineers' Cup, while the\n\" B\" team is 2nd in Div. 2. The\nNovices team is somewhat erratic,\nbut several members shoot usefully for the \" A\" and \" B\" teams.\nIn the Standing and Kneeling\nLeague the \" A\" team is so far\nunbeaten, again leading the divi-sion, while the \" B\" team is 3rd. The Pistol Team, led by T. Freeman, the U.L. Pistol Secretary\nand aided by J. Coombs (ex-QMC\npistol champion) is apparently\nunbeatable at the top of the\nleague.\nResults :\nI.C.\"A\"'572558 Q MC\"A\"378578 Battersea \"A\"584565 Kings \"A\" I.C.15191564 Met. Police\nIC'540559U. C.\"B\"457529C. E.M.\"A\" Fives\nBy I. Collins\nThe Fives Club gropes toward\nthe end of the first term of its\nrenascence, and seeks respite\nthere. The club's tiny membership has met regularly, and\nseveral useful players have been\nintroduced to the game.\nHaving inherited few regular,\nannual fixtures, the hunt for opposition is on, and thus I.C. has\nonly played three matches to\ndate\u2014losses every one, but ia.ll\nagainst good sides, and no defeat\nwas belittling.\nWhilst in the first two matches\nagainst St. Thomas' Hospital and\nthe Clove Club, the I.C. strings\nlost to each of the opponents',\nthe match against the U.L.\" Ravens\" was a much closer\naffair. l.C. were 2 points -up at\nthe half-way stage, after both\nplayers had met the first U.L. string.\nFINE BALANCE However, I.C. players often\nseem to be on a knife-edge, balanced between a smooth, competent technique and a rather inept,\nout-of-touch game. To a man, the\nFEWSTRINGS\nATTACHED\nI.C. strings gave the latter display\nagainst the second half of the\nU.L. team, and so the final score\ndissembled justice.\nThe I.C. strings have so far\nbeen unchanged for match play.\nThe senior side, by virtue of age\nalone, one may add, is D. Telfer\nand I. Collins, and I.C. \"Junior\"\nconsists of two Freshers, D. McBain and P. Combes. With improved concentration and consequent standard of play, the abyss\nof next term's fixtures looks\nscale able from the Christmas\nplateau.\nResults :\nI.C.7897 St. Thomas' Hosp.\n62-118 Clove Club.\n74-101 U.L. \u2022'Ravens.\"\nOTHER RESULTS\nHockey :\nR.

S.O. was started several years ago by Alec Dickson it\nwas almost exclusively for school-leave rs and apprentices. During\nthis period it operated on a shoe-string, supported by voluntary subscriptions from firms and individuals and by a small grant from\ngovernment departments. The staff was largely part-time and there\nwas a feeling that idealism and enthusiasm would solve everything.\nIt was fairly common for volunteers to arrive in the host\ncountry and find either that there was no job for them or that the\njob was not really worth doing. Happily this is now a thing of the\npast. Since V. S.O. started a graduate section it has been taken\nvery much under the wing of the British Council. The new offices\nin Hanover Street have an air of efficiency about them that was almost\ncompletely missing in the old offices in the Commonwealth Society.\nTo-day V. S.O. itself and the British Council try to investigate all jobs\nbefore volunteers are sent; naturally this cannot be perfect but errors\nare becoming increasingly rare.\nSecondary School Biology Instruction.\nIf I volunteer what sort of job am\nI likely to be given ?\nThe vast majority of volunteers\nare given teaching jobs in secondary schools, universities, technical colleges and teacher training colleges. However, there are\na few jobs available in other\nfields : last year three civil engineers went abroad, a forensic\nchemist to British Guiana, and\ngeologists to Borneo. Each year\nseveral other specialists are asked\nfor but these are far fewer than\nthe un m ber of teachers required.\nSHORT\nTizard Hall's Mulled Wine\nParty on Sunday 6th December\nwas attended by senior members\nof staff, including the Rector. It\nis meetings such as this that will\nbring the staff and students closer\ntogether. Unfortunately only two\nMews' residents were able to at-tend.\nA member of the Felix Staff\nrecently had a very welcome\nwindfall to the tune of \u00a3398 18s.2d. on the fixed odds football\npools. He's getting married next\nyear!\nThere were over a hundred\ncoats on the counter of the Southside cloakroom a week ago last\nSunday, because no cloakroom\nattendant was on duty. This\nseems surprising after the discussion in the Union meeting (see\nfront page).\nEXPLOSION\nAnd at the tli ir teen th hour . . .\nHad the Watchmen of the\nGuard executed their duties diligently on the night of December\n3rd, perhaps ye Houses of Weeks\nwould not have suffered a dastardly attempt to eliminate the\nsub-keeper and all others therein.\nShortly after 1 a.m. the three\nscore and six bedchamber s were\nrocked by the effects of a revolutionary gunpowder detonating\ndevice \" placed in the refuse receptacle cunningly concealed in\nthe centre of the landing.\nThe sub-keeper, shortly afterwards emerged in his night-attire,\nand was heard to he muttering\nsuitable thanks for salvation in\nthe modern Australian idiom.\nSo great was the explosion, that\nresidents in the servants quarters\nopposite, and in Southside\nTowers were awakened, as were\nresidents in the higher reaches of\nthe Houses of Weeks.\nVoluntary Service Overseas is an organisation about which one\nhears a lot of contradictory statements and about which all prospective volunteers have a lot of questions.

S.O. is patronising in its attitude and full of do-good ers.

    "content": "FELI X5 Guildfinger\nThe column born of our age,\nreplacing the old Spaimerama.\nThe column that gives you the\nnews and views of Guildsmen.\n7.00 p.m. Wedour special cor-Union Office,\nnes day. From\nrespondent.\nThere is an increase in the\ncrime wave sweeping through\nImperial College. This was the\nreluctant conclusion to which I was forced after I had secreted\nmyself into a Guilds Union Meeting (disguised as a spanner) which\nwas held tomorrow.\nForthcoming at this meeting\nwere several important facts concerning a vast criminal organ is a tion, known as the \" Guilds.\" An anonymous tape recorder gave\naway closely guarded secrets concerning the recent dramatic\n\"Great Theta Theft.\" I had\nhardly recovered from the shock\nwhich these meticulous details\nhad given me, when another\naudacious play was revealed. A number of the gang, disguised as\nstudent \" Carol Singers,\" were to\ngather in the entrance to the\nMechanical Department of the\nCollege at 7.00 p.m., and were\nthen to proceed to open an attack,\nby foot, on the West End of London itself.\nFinally, the gang were to hold\na celebration al orgy at \" M's Baths.\" This would c irc um vol ve throwing a number of innocent\nvictims into the turgid waters,\nand forcing them to attempt to\ncatch the crack swimmers of the\n\" Guilds.\" Obviously this is an\nunenviable, even an impossible\ntask.\nIt is obvious to even the untrained eye that the gang is highly\norganised, even to the extent of\nimprudence. The head of the\ngang is apparently the ubiquitous\n\" Y, \"who has the backing of a large international organisation,\nknown to the few as the \"O.C's.\" In recent weeks they have\nshocked the world with such escapades as the \" stealing of the\nLord Mayor's Show,\" the \"hold-ing to ransom of the inhabitants\nof Brighton,\" in which they employed their secret weapon,\nknown by the code name of\n\" Bo.\" There was also their\nstrategic naval victory at the\n\" Battle of the Morphy \"? cl964. It seems that the gang, flushed\nwith recent successes consider\nthemselves invincible, and unless\nrapid concerted action is taken\nagainst this powerful organ is a tion, they will only be sated by\ncomplete domination of the\nworld, as we know it, and of I.C. NEW THETA\nThe new Theta (see above) was adopted as the official R.C.S. Union meeting. It was also decided that the old Theta should be\nsacrificial ly burned because it had been contaminated by guilds men( whose half-life is five years. This is because guilds men are thicker\nthan R.C.S. men and need longer to take a3 year course.)\nTROPHY OFFICERS' TRIAL\nAfter the Graham Clarke of Court had introduced the case,\nAdrian Fletcher, prosecuting, built up a massive case against the\naccused. His first witness, Miss Gladly Ann Freely, had almost\nseduced the entire jury before it became apparent that although she\nknew many interesting things none of these were relevant to the\ncase. It was then shown how the loss of Theta had affected a typical\ninnocent fresher. A young lad, Algernon Brass, conclusively demonstrated that he was a mental wreck. Then the prosecution produced\ntheir chief witness, Private Eye Rodney Slothly-Nicely, who testified how he had found the Trophy Officer celebrating the loss of\nTheta, and, in particular, how he found a heavy blunt instrument,\nnamely Graham Clarke.\nTed Needham, defending, then called his chief witness, who just\nhappened to be Rodney Slothly-Nicely who (for an undisclosed sum\nof money) reversed all his earlier tes time nts. Throughout the proceedings, the other counsels played a major\npart. Ray Phillips successfully objected to Adrian Fletcher several\ntimes (and who would blame him) until he realised they were both\non the same side. Roger Cook (who assures me that he is not pre g nant) attempted to visualise the proceedings by holding up pieces\nof paper containing challenge able statements, e. g.RAY PHILLIPS\nIS A HOMO sapiens.\nSurprising as it may or may not seem, the accused were found\nguilty, and the traditional sentence passed on them. This was\ncarried out a few minutes later at the Round Pond when they were\nimmersed, fully clothed, in its healing waters.\nFor Photograph see page 4\nGENTLEMEN OF MINES\nACADEMIC SUB-COMMITTEE\nThe meeting chaired by John Taylor, Mines Vice President,\nwas held on Tuesday, 8th December.\nThe first topic discussed was the relationship between Mines\nUnion and the A. Sc.W. It was finally decided that no action would\nbe taken until after the A. Sc.W. had been discussed by I.C. Council.\nThe meeting then went on to discuss the tutorial system in general\nduring the course of which several interesting conclusions were drawn.\nOn the whole it was thought that the tutorial system in Mines was\noperating well but that it might possibly be a good idea if marked\nreports were handed back via one's personal tutor.\nThis would have the dual purpose of bringing the tutor and student\nmore frequently together and also give the tutor some idea of ones\nprogress.\nQuestionnaires dealing with the whole question of tutorials,\nlectures and syllabus are being formulated at the time of writing.\nFRESHERS POT\nThe fresher s pot was presented to Roger Lea for the fastest and\ndriest yard at the fresher s dinner in 9.4 seconds. Roger readily\ndemonstrated his skill by christening his newly acquired prize.\nTHE BARBARAFEST\nMonday morning we were faced with the sight of two Minesmen,\nFergus Kerr and Piet Velzeboer, returned from Paris and St. Etienne\nafter 10 days of wine (champagne), women (French) and song (\u2014).\nThis visit culminated with the Grand Ball of St. Etienne School of\nMines and was a fitting closure to the week of revelry known on the\nContinent as Barbarafest, St. Barbara being the patron Saint of\nMiners.\nMINES 3, GUILDS ,1\nThis was the result of the first round of the Stephenson Hockey\nCup. Mines thrashed Guilds; we completely dominated the first half,\nscoring all 3 goals through a strong Guilds defence during that period.\nEach goal was the climax of a team movement neatly finished by the\nscorer. Our scorers being Mike Ansty and Miles Philpot. The forwards and half-backs played well, inter-passing and intercepting passes\ntruely.\nMines defence were never really tested, they dealt easily with the\nfull weight of the Guilds forwards. The goal that Guilds did score\nbeing generously conceded by our goal keeper.\nA win against R.C.S. will mean that our hockey team have the\ncup. The result an near s in the Late News.\nMINES NIGHT, THURSDAY, 17th DECEMBER\nMines night this time is being held in conjunction with a carol\nsinging tour of the West End. Our guests on the evening will be the\nforeign students from the European Mining Schools who are with us\nat present and to whom we give a hearty welcome.\nThe evening will start with a2 hour vocal lubricating and warm-up in the I.C. bar. The party, which will number approximately 60,\nwill then move off with collecting tins to the melodious strains of the\ncarol \"Away in a Manger.\" Once in the West End those Minesmen\nwith tins will be deployed strategically around the main body. The\npurpose of this movement will be two-fold, firstly to collect and\nsecondly to restrain the more thirsty ones amongst us. For, as Big\nBen chimes 11 o 'clock, we will be led to a rendezvous where carefully\nhidden will be two barrels of beer.\nSMOKING CONCERT\nCongratulations to Mike\nGrodie and Dick Smith for producing the best Smoking Concert\nfor years.

WALKER\nBusiness\nCartoonists\nPhotographic\nEditor\nRobin Webster,\nPeter Combes,\nGeoff. Bean,\nBarry Pichler\nBrian Bull,\nChris Wright\nJohn Cawson\nOpinion expressed in these pages are not necessarily those of the\nFelix Editorial Board.\nThis term, behaviour has been relatively sane and sober. Unlike\nprevious terms, there have not been floods of complaints over noise\nin Southside, there have no violent disagreements between staff and\nstudents, or petty squabbles between members of the Union hier arcy. However, there have been a number of occurrences in or concerning\nthe Halls, which have caused much ill will between the Wardens and\ntheir Disciplinary Committees. Under the present Hall rules, the\nWarden can override his Hall Disciplinary Committee. Such a move\nwould surely destroy any trust between the student-residents and the\nWarden of the hall concerned, and would generally be regarded as\na step backwards from everyone's ideal of staff-student relations.\nOf course, it is up to the members of the Hall Committees to\nadopt, at all times, a reasonable and responsible attitude. It is regrettable that, on a number of occasions this term, members of the Disciplinary Committees have reprimanded other members of their hall\nfor making a noise, and, ten minutes later, were causing an even\ngreater nuisance themselves.\nStudents are, in general, responsible people; and those holding\nsenior posts must remain responsible at all times.\nAt efb\nI would like to take this opportunity to wish\nall members of the Felix staff and all our many\nreaders a very Merry Christmas and a successful\nNew Year.\nForeign Affairs\nANTI-APARTHEID APATHY\nThere is a big row at King's College because only six of their\nstudents turned up for the anti-apartheid rally. Presumably it\nhasn't occurred to some zealous\n\"antis\" that not everyone is\nyearning to meddle in the internal\naffairs of another country. Perhaps this is an indication the\npeople are not really as passionately caught up in other country's affairs as some \" pink \" student-politicians would like to think.\nBesides, is everyone really sympathetic with a terrorist movement\nwhich places bombs in stations,\nkilling innocent people. Once\nagain, it looks like one net of\nopinion for whites and another\nfor blacks. The O.A.S. were\nwhite, and naturally condemned\nby \" world opinion! \" The South\nAfrican terrorists are black and,\njust as naturally, are condemned\nby \" world opinion\" for performing the same acts of terrorism in roughly similar c irc um stances.\nBUNNY STUDENTS!\nReading Union is looking for\ngirls who look bed able but are\nnot bed able to^ict as bunny girls.\nA local brewer who wants to open\na spicy restaurant has appealed to\nthe University for girls.\nGOWNS FOR NEWCASTLE\nNewcastle Students Representative Council has passed a motion that \"Gowns should be worn\nto all lectures by students in this\nUniversity\" by a narrow majority.\nOpinion in the main student body\nis strongly against so be prepared\nfor an outcry.\nKING'S UNION\nUNDERSPEND!\nKing's are worried about\nUnderspending. Their Union un-der spent by over two thousand\npounds last year. The figure was\ndescribed by the secretary as \"far\ntoo high\" and it is hoped to bring\nthe profit margin down next year.\nEXETER GOWNS\nExeter students are being urged\nto wear gowns so that visitors\nrealise that the town does possess\na University!\nSHEFFIELD VERDICT\nThe seven students responsible\nfor the Rag Week Mock Murder\nwere sentenced to two weeks\nsuspension by a Union Discipline\nTribunal. One of the guilty quite\nrightly called it \" harsh and un-ne cesar y.\" IF YOU CANT HAVE ON EBUY ONE!\nAberystwyth Union, the on jy STUDENT ACADEMICS\nWhat must be realised about the A. Sc.W. is that\nprovided the Unions, especially the constituent\nones, are doing their jobs properly, then it is completely irrelevant to undergraduate needs. The\npresent saga of events started in the Chemistry\ndepartment, whose students decided to call in the\nA. Sc.Wu, rather than the R.C.S. Union, to help in\ntrying to set up a staff student committee. This\nsomewhat misguided action was, I am told,\nprompted by a feeling that the Union was really\nonly interested in \"sport\" and beer full stop.\nTalking to union officials, I am convinced that\nnothing could be further from the truth. In the\nJong run, as always, it comes back to the ordinary\nmember, the so-called man in the street. He (or\nshe) can hardly expect the Union to reflect the\nopinions of its members unless they tell their reps\nwhat these are. At the moment, far too few\npeople are prepared to do this.\nTHAT HARLINGTON BEER\nAsk any sportsman about Harlington beer, and\nthe odds are that the answer won't be couched in\nvery complimentary terms. Enquire further, and\nyou will find that its sale is controlled by the eight\nstrong Athletic Ground Committee, five of whom\nare students. It appears that in 1961 we made\na gentlemen's agreement with Fullers to sell their\nbeer exclusively \" for several years.\" The problem therefore is one of equating the definition of\n\" several years \" against the quality (or lack of)\nof the beer, and the latter seems to win. It is the\nduty of all students on the A GC to forcibly put\nforward the opinion of the people they represent\n\u2014only then will anything be done.\nBUILDERS WANTED\nI was very glad that the Union decided to\nchoose the Notting Hill Housing Trust as this\nyear's Carnival charity. At last we have a chance\nnot only to enjoy ourselves, but to give help of\na practical nature to solve a vast problem on our\nOwn doorstep. My only fear is that the stirring\n\" do it all ourselves\" speeches at the adoption\nmeeting, will in fact merely result in the Carnival\nR. CS.

This\nwas the general concensus of\nopinion at a meeting of interested\nmembers of staff and the Union\non Tuesday, December 1st. Contact among the resident\npopulation was, on the whole,\nquite good, but relations with\nstaff and students not living in\nHall were in a sorry state.\nAnother meeting ground\nshould be provided by the Union\nSocieties.

Exposed - page 6\nURAL CHARITY Members of I.C Union seemed to wish that the College be recognised by the citizens of the\nRoyal Borough of Kensington as THEIR COLLEGE when they elected that the Notting Hill Housing Trust Association be the 1965 Carnival charity at the last Union Meeting of term, on December\n3rd. Of the four charities proposed, the NHHTA, whose case was put by Chris Tye, last year's President of R.C.S., was the only one to evoke strong vocal support from the house, and, put to\nthe vote, it won overwhelmingly.\nIt was carried because it presents the greatest challenge (\" They need our help because they can't help themselves \"\u2014Bob Collins), there is a\" Great possibility of . . . giving manpower help \" (Chris\nEvans, R.C.S. Vice-President, added, \" All we ever do round here is cause noise and nuisance'-)\nand we shall be able to see the fruits of our labours (but \" Personal pride should not enter into it\"\n\u2014Chris Tye).\nOf the other proposer s, David Reich, President of Debates, presented the strongest case, for the\nImperial Cancer Research Fund. Barry Utting, I.C.U. Secretary, droned on about Oxfam in a speech that seemed the longest but was, in fact, the shortest, and Barry Mair, ICU Deputy Presiderit, seemed beaten before he began to speak for the British Red Cross Society.\nCommenting on the result, Dougal McCreath, spokesman for the Carnival Committee, merely-said, \" Wish us luck.\"\nSee also page 3\nMIKE TO BE MASCOT\nGuilds, R.C.S. and Mines are to make a joint effort to manufacture a five-foot working micrometer. \" As this is university it\nwill be graduated in degrees.\"\nReferring to his copy of Felix 210 for facts Nigel Gravette proposed\nat December 3rd's Union Meeting, that \" As I.C. is a predominately\nmale college it is only appropriate that it should have a screw gauge\nas its mascot.\"\nBISHOP PUSHES LAMPOST\nMuch concern was expressed that a micrometer was not in fact\nrepresentative of all the sciences and technologies studied at I.C., and David Bishop, President of Guilds., made an abortive attempt\nto amend micrometer in the motion with lamppost. The former,\nhe felt, had \" Too much of an engineering bias,\" and showed \" the\nnarrow-minded outlook of Imperial College,\" a lamp-post, he felt,\nrepresented our past by being Victorian, our present by being in the\nmiddle of the Beit Quadrangle, and our future by shedding light.\nOn its defeat he explained that Imperial College IN PLACE OF\nthe Queen's Tower.\" The motion\nwas carried.\nDISCUSSION\nThe clock ruled that some\nbusiness in the Union Meeting be\nheld over until Friday, December\n4th. This was in quo rate so a valuable half-hour was spent in\ninformal discussion.\nKeith Cavanagh, student Chairman of I.C.A. Sc.W., moved that\na Staff-Student Committee be set\nJohn Tutelman, Ex-Chairman\nup to investigate Lecturing MeCont. on page 2.\nhe had only put forward the\namendment to make the meeting\nconsider seriously the prospect of\na micrometer as a mascot and\nnot to make a rushed or rash de-c is ion.

    "content": "FELIX3 THIS YEAR'S Christopher Tye investigates\nthe Notting Hill Housing Trust\nThe Housing Problem If you go to Holland Park and then walk north along Clarendon\nRoad, the character of the houses soon changes from smart w hi'e painted ones at the south to the delap i dated and crumbling one?\nat the north. In the Notting Hill and Ladbroke Grove area there\nsome appalling slums. In this area several families have a home consisting of just one room.\nThere are now some 1,000 homeless families in L.CC. Reception\nCentres, 6,500 people in London are homeless at the present time.\nThere are thousands of families in London living in one room and\npaying \u00a33 to \u00a35 a week for it.\nThe roots of the housing problem would seem to be in the fact\nthat there is a shortage of family-type accommodation in London.\nLow-income families are charged high rents. Many are exploited,\nand Rachmanism continues even now.\nThe Swifts in their new house renovated by the Trust.\nThe Trust\nBad housing and complete\nlack of housing are the root\ncauses of many urgent social\nproblems, e.g. divorce, disease\nand crime. A small group of\npeople who live and work in Notting Hill banded together to fight\nthe housing problem. They\nformed the Notting Hijl Housing\nTrust, on 20th Dec. 1963.\nThis charitable trust has two\nmain objects:\u2014\n(1) To provide homes for\nfamilies and old people who are\neither homeless or living in\ngrossly overcrowded conditions.\n(2) To provide rehabilitation\nwhere this is necessary.\nThe short-term objectives are\nto train the victims for higher\npaid jobs\u2014this will increase their\nself-respect and ease their financial problems.\nThe Solution\nThe solution 10 the problem is\nobviously a political one in the\nlong run. Both the major political parties agree that it will take\nten years to re house the present\nvictims.\nBut something must be done\nnow! In ten years time the\nchildren will be embittered\nadults, old folk will have died in\nsqualor, and many couples will\nbe soured by mean married lives.\nAt Present\nSome examples of the shocking\nconditions found around Notting\nHill are given below :\n(1) An expectant mother, father\nand two children lived in a basement room ten foot\nsquare. Rain came through\nthe window and rats came in\nat night. The rent was\n\u00a33 10s. a week. They have\nnow been rehoused by the\nTrust.\n(2) A family of six live in one\ndark, damp room. They\nhave no kitchen and no hot\nwater. The cold water tap is\nshared by 13 people. The\nlavatory is shared by 19\npeople. They pay \u00a35 10s. rent a week.\n(3) A man earning \u00a39 a week\npays \u00a36 rent for the room in\nwhich he lives with his\nfamily of six.\n(4) A family of nine live in one\nsmall room. One daughter\nleft home to find a room of\nher own. She is now a pros-t it ute.(5) A man aged 20 was evicted\nwith his family four times,\ntwice violently after mid-night. He rebelled against\nsociety by stealing and is\nnow a convict.\nWhen the Labour Government\nrepeals the 1957 Rent Act, rent\ncontrol will be brought back and\nthere will be more control of evictions. But the number of flats in\nLondon is not going to increase\nover-night (if anything they will\nbe harder to get) so the problem\nof overcrowding and homelessness will remain.\nWhat They Do\nThe Trust is buying large\nhouses, converting them (partly\nwith volunteer labour) into good\nsimple homes which are then let\nat reasonable rents to the most\nneedy members of society with no\ndistinction between colour or\ncreed.\nThe full-time administration\nstaff consists of three people who\nwork in an unpretentious office in\nNotting Hill. They have given up\njobs with salaries between \u00a32,000\nand \u00a3740 and now work for a joint salary of \u00a3250 per year. So\nfar the administration costs\namount to only 2 per cent, of the\nmoney received.\nA full-time master-carpenter is\nalso employed at a low salary.\nHe directs the rebuilding operations often done by volunteer\nwork parties. When the funds\npermit, it is intended to employ\na housing manager, an electrician\nand a plumber.\nRev. Ken rick\nThe Chairman of the Trust is\nRev. Bruce Kenrick a Presbyterian Minister who lives in Blenheim Crescent, Notting Hill. He\nwas very pleased that the Union\nhad decided to support the Trust\nfor this year's Charity Carnival.\nHe came to the first meeting of\nthe Carnival Committee to explain what the Trust was doing.\nHe was interested to learn of the\nproposed Carnival activities and\nhe offered his help in several\nways.\nHe has one slight worry\u2014that\nsome irresponsible action in aid\nof the Carnival might damage the\nreputation of the Trust. We must\nmake sure that this does not\nhappen.\nLocal Charity\nBecause this Charity is local we\ncan do more than just raise\nmoney. It is believed that there\nare several students in I.C. who\nwill be willing to form working\nparties to go up to Notting Hill\nand help the Trust in its work of\nconverting Houses into flats.\nParties from the Anglican Chaplaincy are already doing this. It\nis hoped to organise several\nothers next term.\nRenovation in Progress in Notting Hill\nFinance\nAs the Trust has been in operation for only just a year it is in\ngreat need of money; every penny\nreceived is urgently needed. By\nusing L.C.C. Loans and Local\nAuthority Grants each pound\ngiven does the work of many\nmore. The funds are managed by\na finance committee consisting of\nthree chartered accountants, a solicitor, a tax expert, a High\nCourt Judge and a Q.C. \u00a3650 given to the Trust will\ninstall a family of six in a permanent house.\n\u00a3200 given to the Trust will\ngive a permanent home to an old-age pensioner.\nNotting Hill Housing Trust Photographs by kind permission ot Clay Perrv.\nWell, I.C. students, the rest is\nup to you. The Carnival can use\nyou in some way, and every effort\nmade will bring in some cash\nwhich will be gratefully received\nby the Notting Hill Housing\nTrust.\ngNi iii iii iii in iiii iiii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii in ii in|| CHRISTMAS VACATION I| WORK |\nStudents on vacation in =\nLONDON over Christmas =\nare invited to app iy for tern- Bp or ary night work as Security Officers guarding property and premises in the\nGreater London area Minimum age 20.

Cup\nI.C. FOIL C.E.M and a Slippery Pitch\nI.C. the present U.L. League\nleaders lined up on Wed 9th Dec.\nagainst a C.E.M. side containing\n2 U.L. players and an England\nunder 23 international. This was\nthe rather grim cup quarter-final\nmatch which I.C. faced at\nC.E.M.' s home ground at Hinchley Wood. The opening moments\nwere occupied with mid-field\nsparring in which I.C. soon\nachieved the upper hand and in\nthe fifth minute E. Hough slipped\nthrough the middle to beat the\ngoalkeeper and score with a reverse stick shot.\nThe home side, holders of the\ncup, were shaken by this and\nafter ten minutes of steady pressure a flicked centre from the left\nwas clipped into the goal again by\nHough.\nThis pressure, apart from\nsporadic C.E.M. breakaway at-tacks, continued for the rest of\nthe half without success, Mackenzie being very unlucky to miss by\ninches from the edge of the circle\nas he was upended.\nAfter the interval, the C.E.M. side was changed around, Mason,\nthe England player being'moved\nto inside right\nFor the opening 15 mins. of\nthis half the team's concentration\nwaned slightly and the Cemian\nforwards took immediate advantage of this. Lapses of marking\non both sides of the field enabled\na centre from the right to be\nstroked into the net by the inside\nleft.\nThis goal combined with the\nenthusiasm of I.C.s few but vociferous supporters stirred the team\nout of their day-dreaming and for\nthe last fifteen minutes they were\npressing hard once again. When\nthe final whistle came, however,\nthe score card still read 2-1 in\nEC's favour. Throughout, the\nstandard of play was much higher\nthan could be expected on such a slippery pitch. On this, both\nsides are to be congratulated.\nAlthough C.E.M., on their own\nadmission, are not as strong as\nlast year, when they thrashed\nU.C.61 to win the cup, this result gives the I.C.' team a moral\nboost which may well be sufficient\nto take them to the league, Cup,\nand six-a side treble cover ted by\nall.\nSquash\nLack of Courts\n\"Inconvenient\"\nBy R.W. Scott\nOnce the lassitude induced by\nthe fine summer vacation had\nbeen shaken off, the 1stV has\nenjoyed a large measure of success. So far this season, matches\nhave been much closer than last\nyear since I.C. has lost some leading players, The Freshers show\nmuch promise and are benefiting\nfrom the tougher squash played\nat College.\nThe team had a very enjoyable\ntrip to Cranwell during October,\nrecording the first win; and early\nin November two teams visited\nCambridge. Each won one, and\nlost the second of its matches.\nThe Club, however, still only\noffers very limited facilities.\nAlthough this has not affected\nthe spirit of 1st and 2nd team\nplayers, it has meant that other\nmembers of the Club have not\nhad a fair crack of the whip. In\nspite of the facilities it is very\ncreditable that upon average, at\nleast two 1stV and one 2nd V matches are played each week.\nLike Swimming and Rifle, the\nSquash Club eagerly look forward to the completion of the\nSports Centre.\nBadminton\nMIXED SUCCESS\nBy M. Fitzgerald\nRecently, the I.C. first team\nlost its first league match in four\nyears, being defeated 4-5 by\nKings College.\nThis fixture clashed with the\nBritish Universities Sports Federation (B.U.S. F.) Championships\nand as I.C.'s two U.L. players\ncompeted, the team was considerably weakened.\nThe Mixed team are still unbeaten with recent victories over\nU.L.(63) and Bart's Hospital\n(5-4). The latter win was achieved\nagainst a team which contained\ntwo county players and one U.L. player. D. Forster and Miss D. Wokes won two games, and D. Fisher and Miss K. Seneviratne\nwon one game 15-11 in the third\nset, after trailing 6-11.\nAfter losing the first four games\nof the match, I.C.2 nd team surprised Goldsmiths by beating\nthem 54.\nFencing\nResults .\n1st v.P.16.2n dv.P.7. Won 10\nWon 4\nThis term apparent apathy among other London fencing clubs\nhas restricted the number of\nmatches fought to four, of which\nI.C. won two, drew one and lost\none.\nThe recently acquired electrical\nequipment was put to good use in\nthe recent \"Goddin Cup\" between London colleges, when\nboth the 1st and 2n dI.C. teams\nwere unlucky not to gain promotion from the quarter-finals.\n\n"

Carping Comments\nA.S c.W Sir,\nTaken in conjunction with various chortling s about Sennet's\" sensationalism and inaccuracy \" in reporting and possibilities of\nlibel action, and the letters complaining about racial and political\nsmears, Felix' (210) article about the A. Sc.W. could hardly have\ncome at a worse time.\nThe correctness of the quotation from the A. Sc.W. Rules shows\nthat N.J. W. and D.I. W. must have read at least part of them. If\nso, it is inexcusable that they should have used Rule 3fl ll as they did.\nIn full the rule reads: \u2014\n\" To pursue the furtherance of political objects to which section\n3 of the Trade Union Act, 1913, applies, as defined by Rules 83 and\n84.\"\nRules 83 and 84 concern contributions to the Association's Political Fund, the use of which is strictly defined by the above Rules and\nTrade Union Act. Such contributions are of course not compulsory.\nAllegations of Communism need no comment, beyond pointing\nout the letters of other irate readers concerning the irrelevance of\npolitical leanings in non-political bodies. The A. Sc.W. does not discuss\npolitics, it does what its 16 objects before RuleWll say. It negotiates\non behalf of its members for their benefit and for that of science and\nthe scientific industry in general.\nLack of political leanings is said to be a source of strength for\nI.C.U.( and College Unions) in their relations with the staff. What\nthen is the secret of the A. Sc.W.'s obvious success in past years and\nnow? Could it be that the Association spends its lime doing what it\nwas set for, looking after its members, rather than in indulging in\nstudent politics?\nYours sincerely,\nP.F. HART (Metallurgy P.G.) ED: What successes has I.C.A. Sc.W. had in Student matters?\nDepravity\nDear Sir,\nIn view of recent criticism in\nyour columns directed against the\n\" depravity \" of Sennet, I was not\na little surprised to come across\nthe Sennet of March 10 this year.\nIt carried a report of articles in\ncontemporary editions of Felix,\nin which it was able to use such\na phrase as \"extremely suggestive\npictorial back page.\" The content of several articles in Felix at\nthat time was obviously open to\nserious crit is is m. People in glass houses . . .\nYours etc.,\nL.F. JOHNSON (Chem. 1)\nEd: Felix is now under new\nmanagement.\nRecord ?\nDear Editor,\nLast Tuesday I received a letter\nthrough the Internal post, dated\nNovember Sth 1962. Is this a record?\nPENELOPE M. WILLIAMS\nAPOLOGY\nWe offer our sincere apologies\nto Mr. A. Stephenson and Mr. F. Irving concerning an item in the\nlate news of issue 210 on Halls\nof Residence. The meeting alleged\nto have taken place with Mr.\nStephenson in the chair did not,\nin fact, take place. We regret\nany inconvenience or misunderstanding that may have arisen\nthrough this article.\nFreshers Dinners\nDear Sir,\nNow that the Freshers Dinners\nhave finis lied, we feel that we can\nvoice our opinions on the subject.\nIt appears that a convention\nhas grown up over the years that\nFreshers Dinners are all male, all\ndrinking, all swearing sessions\npunctuated by derision as the\nfreely flowing beer causes someone to leave the room.\nWe - feel that these Freshers\nDinners are not the best way to\nintroduce a Freslver to the college,\nand tli ey give a completely false\nimpression of what is to follow.\nWe are also sure that many of\ntile staff and other speakers would\nbe able to provide far better\namusement after dinner if they\nwere not obliged to reiterate the\nold and exceedingly obscene jokes\nw hid h seem to o^ ur with monotonous regularity every year.\nThey would aU o feel far less\nembarrassed at being asked to\nattend a Freshers Dinner.\nCould the dinners themselves\nnot be kept decent and conducted\nin a more mature manner ? The\ndirty jokes and songs could be\nsaved for the bar later, so that\nthose who feel that they do not\nwish to take part in such activities\nmay opt out and not be forced to\nsit through the e xlii bit ion.

HERTZOG Aero I DAVE HICK, Mining I TONY FIRMIN Aero II\nDear Sir,\nAfter Mr. Needham's deliberate misrepresentation of the number\nof people at the debate with Kings College (see,my letter and Mr.\nNeedham's reply in Felix No. 209) we now have the carping comments\non the Debating Society in your last issue. You did not bother to\npoint out that attendances have been appreciably more than last year\n(averaging about 120 this year). All the debates except one have had\nsufficient floor speeches, to make them run their full time. The exception was the contraception debate, when quite a few people were\nprepared to speak against the motion, but only one person was prepared to speak for it; thus the floor speeches were cut short as it is a rule of debates that floor speeches should be evenly balanced between\nthose for and against the motion. These facts contradict your statement that there has been little speaking from the floor. The number\nof speakers from the floor, in fact, should be sufficient to get the potential good speakers to become good speakers and provide the number of\ngood speakers that a College the size of l.C. should have.\nYours faithfully, R.J. KIRK (Physics lit)\nLighting Arrangements Dear Sir,\nMay I be permitted to make use of your columns to make an\nannouncement concerning entertainments in l.C. As many of your readers are aware, all lighting and most of the\nsound equipment for entertainments is installed and operated by the\ntechnical departments oi the Dramatic Society. While we are always\nwilling to help and our services are provided free of charge we find\nit very difficult to arrange things at a moment's notice\nAs from the beginning of the Spring Term we will not consider\nany work unless we are given adequate notice. Those who have not\nseen the circular can obtain copies from me or any lighting department\nmember.\nRequests for lighting should be given to me and requests for\nsound work to Eric Thorniley of Elec. Eng. and not to the President\nor Secretary of the society.\nYours faithfully, PHILIPS and EDWARDS\n(Dramatics Soc, Lighting Supervisors)\nUnfortunately due to the lack of space the above two letters had\nto be cut.\nWinter\nHolidays\nARE\nSnow & Sun\nHolidays\nbook yours through N.U.S. and be sure of student company\nPROGRAMME COVERS WINTER 1964-5 AND SPRING\n1965.
