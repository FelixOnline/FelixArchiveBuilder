    "content": "FELIX 1!\nPOLITICS and the NATIONAL\nUNION OF STUDENTS\nJohn Lane AMONGST THE many redoubtable\nqualities of that mythical beast 'the\naverage IC student' the most frequently\nreported is a hostility to NUS and\nto 'politics' in NUS. There are at least\n3 ways 'politics' arises in the student\nmovement.\nFirst, all important student issues are\nintimately would up with Government\nPolicy. So you can't avoid it, even if you\nwant to. At this level, Northern Ireland\nwould be discussed by NUS Conference\nbecause a number of NUS members are\nimprisoned without charge or trial and\nbecause at various times colleges have\nbeen occupied by the British Armed\nForces.\nSecond, the amount of democracy\nexperienced by the overwhelming majority\nin this country, is precious little, perhaps\n15-20 general elections with many important questions 'not election issues'\nand a distinct lack of choice between the\nmajor parties, anyway. The only way\nmost people have of giving effective\nvoice to their opinions, or organising to\ndo something about them, is through\ndemocratic organisations like student\nunions or trade unions.\nThirdly, in a situation where students'\ninterests are increasingly threatened, It\nis of urgent importance to find reliable\nand long-term allies. Inevitably, this\nmeans assessing the relative value of\nalliances with big business and its press\nor with the organised working class\nmovement, particularly since the latter\nnow embraces large sections of those\nwhite-collar and professional workers,\nwho are misleading ly referred to as\n'middle*class'. The usual argument\nagainst discussing this, stems from a fear of offending those in authority,\neditors, politicians, vice-chancellors,\nbusinessmen etc. Unfortunately, as\nConfucius said. 'He who sit on fence\nreally feel cuts when trousers wear thin'.\nIf your assessment is that it is in the\ninterests of both students and the working\nclass to have more access to education\nand to solve the housing crisis, say, then\nyou must fact up to the problem of overcoming both 'middle-class' elitism among\nstudents and the 'students scabbed in\n1926' attitude among the older generation\nof trade unionists. An obvious way is to\nact together on common problems and to\ngive our support when they face attacks\neven if we aren't directly involved. And\nif the education cuts are more than just\na piece of government stupidity, but\nreflect the power that the interests of\nprivate enterprise have in the Treasury,\nirrespective of party in power, then\nappealing to the reason of establishment\nfigures will fail, as it has failed so\nconsistently in the past.\n'Students as Such*\nThe more coherent critics of politics\nin NUS would accept my first point only,\nand insert a rule in NUS constitution\nwhich restricted discussion to 'students-as-such' issues. Such a rule existed until\nquite recently. Why was it abolished?\nFirst, it was absolutely absurd that\nmost student activity in the middle\n1960's was about Vietnam which NUS\ncould not even discuss! Secondly, the\nold right-wing dominated leadership had\nbeen busy trying to involve NUS in a relic of the cold war, the International\nStudent Conference, which later collapsed when its source of funds (the CIA)\nwas exposed by US student leaders. The\nExecutive wished to speak on international\naffairs for Vim, British students, without\neven the authority of an NUS conference\npolicy, Thirdly, there has been a realisation that to make policy on just the\nstudent bit of problems like Northern\nIreland or housing leads to bad policy,\nin eons is ten c ies,' special case for students' selfishness and so on. How can you\ndemand more cheap student accommodation at the expense of local families?\nOr ask for higher grants if you accept that\nthis will bring the country to ruin? Or\nobject to imp r is ion ment without charge\nor trial, of your fellow students, without\nobjecting to the internment policy as such?\nReds under the Bed\nIn spite of these arguments the suspicion remains that the student movement\nis being used by politically motivated\ngroups for their own selfish aims. Certainly\ntwo groups do so. When the YSSS\n(remember 'Force the Tories to Resign'?)\nspeak they are only interested in the\nsmall minority of potential recruits. On\nthe opposite wing the voice of Conservative students is only raised on\nlefty-bashing issues.\nOn the other hand the ascendancy of\nthe left in NUS has been accompanied by\nan increase in internal democracy. The\nelection system for executive guarantees\nrepresentation for significant minorities;\nthe steering committee which once ruled,\nconference with a rod of iron is now\ncontrolled by compositing meetings; the\nnew policy making conferences for\nUniversities, Polys, FE sector, post-grads etc, involve a much wider range of\nstudents directly in NUS decision making;\nresolutions are now only discussed at\nNUS Conference if they are chosen in a ballot of all student unions. In fact the\nresolutions discussed in recent years\nreflect if anything the insularity of the\nBritish student movement. NUS has no\nproper policy on the EEC which might be\nthought of some importance even to that\n'average' IC student, while subjects like\nhousing are discussed again and again\nand again.\nWhy then has conference supported the\nBroad Left (the alliance of left Labour,\nCommunist, and non-party socialists) so\nconsistently over 5 years, the main\ndebates being with positions further to\nthe left? Why has no credible alternative\napproach emerged from the right? In fact,\nwhy have the typical student politicians\nof the '50's and '60's, with their rightwing Laboui politics, parliamentary\nambitions and complete hostility to any\nmass actions, why have they so completely\nvanished from the scene? Why the\nincrease in numbers and influence of the\nsocialists?\nAre right-wing students really harder\nthen they used to be? Have they suddenly\nlost interest in the last 6 years? Or is the\nanswer, perhaps the obvious one; a new\ntype of student activist has emerged, and\nbeen elected to positions of leadership,\nbecause of the need of a new situation\nwhere students face problems which can\nonly be met by fighting back, winning\nallies and strengthening the 'fra de union'\nfunction of student unions.\nThe main weakness of NUS's democracy is at its roots in local unions\nwhen students do not exercise their right\nto decide NUS policy or elect delegates.\nThe Editorial in FELIX encouraging\nthese short-sighted attitudes was therefore irresponsible in the extreme.\nJewish Communities\nin India\nThursday 5th December\nMech'.

    "content": "edi to mai. Michael Williams SO WHAT happened at the National\nGrants Demonstration last Friday? A piddling 1\n% turn-out?\nSo maybe the other 99% of the\nstudents at Imperial College do not\ncare about the rough deal married women\nget on grants; maybe they are thumbing\ntheir noses at the poor b lighters at non-university institutions who grants are\nawarded at the whim of an educational\nauthority; maybe they are smug at the\nthought of their parents eroding their\nnest-eggs in order to supplement their\nlittle did dum s' grant. Could it be just\nthat the students of IC are just too\napathetic? Or could it be that this Union\nneeds a Publicity committee, coordinated by a proper Publicity Officer,\ncapable of running a hugh publicity\ncampaign, airing the issues, informing\nthe Union, letting us all know that the\ndemonstrations supported by ICU are\ndemos in earnest, not pathetic dribbles.\nLast year I chaired a Council working\nparty on Publicity and Communications.\nThe most important recommendation,\nwhich was accepted by Council, was\nthat a Publicity Committee should be\nset up under the guidance of a Union\nPublicity Officer. The committee would\nnormally share the burden of general\nUnion publicity but would be capable of\nrunning an extensive publicity campaign\nat the drop of a hat.\nThe proposal as such was passed by\nCouncil. The Union obviously chose to\nignore it. Last Friday shows what a cock-up of a decision that was.\n*\nSuch is our determination that the\nfeature on the subject 'Should the PG\nAffairs Officer be a member of the Exec?'\nshould be fully exploited and well-presented that it has been decided to\nhold over the article till the next issue.\nWe hope that not too many people are\nannoyed/disappointed at its exclusion\nthis week.\n*\u2022\nWe welcome onto our staff the new\nTechnical Manager, John McCloskie,\na Zoology fresher. For Riz Shaker we\nhave reserved the title 'Editor without\nPortfolio'. It is designed to illustrate\nhis immense versatility.\n*\nAs must by now be well-known,\nthere will not be an issue of FELIX\nnext week. We are allowing ourselves a fortnight's run-up to the 25th Anniversary\nIssue, which will be a bumper souvenir\nedition. In a nostalgic vein, it is\nplanned that the FELIX Banner (the Cat\nand the name etc.) will be in silver.\nImperial College Union.\n19th November, 1974.\nSir,\nIn answer to Mr. Lynch's rubbish of last week's 'Letters'\ncolumn, I simply quote from my\nletter to the Rector:\n'...ICL provides most of the\ncomputer facilities which are\nused for processing data on\nSouth Africans; this is in turn\nused in the operation of Pass\nLaws. These laws, which\ninvolve the denial of Africans\nof the right to make a permanent\nhome in many South African\ncities where they work and\nresult in the prosecution of\nalmost one million Africans\nin a year, are one of the\ncornerstones of apartheid....\nthe issue is particularly acute,\nas the manufacturers of these\ncomputers make available the\nvery means by which the\nsystem of apartheid can be\noperated'.\nThis is clearly more than a 'dubious economic connection'.\nWith regard to my concern\nabout other 'races', particularly\nthe Vietnamese, I wonder where\nMr. Lynch was when I was\npicketing the US Embassy\n(between 1971-73) and marching\nin support of the Vietnamese\npeople. He wasn't with us then.\nI am curious as to how I can\npossess an (apparently con-tr adic tory) 'self-centred interest\nin human suffering in other\ncountries'.\nFinally, I don't denigrate\nanything British. Come and\nsee my passport, if you like.\nYours sincerely,\nTrevor Phillips,\nPresident, ICU.\nrc as Grants Demo Criticism\nDepartment of Civil\nEngineering.\n15th November 1974\nDear Sir,\nAfter today's abysmal\nturnout of IC students at the\nNational Grants Demonstration,\nwe feel that only forty in a procession of forty thousand,\nmany having come from as far\naway as Northern Ireland,\nreflects not only apathy, but\nalso a complete inadequacy\nin communications. A couple\nof mentions in FELIX is not\nenough for an activity of this\nimportance. Why is there no\npublicity officer? Although,\nthe Editor of FELIX is nominally the Union Publicity\nOfficer he obviously has no\ntime for this job. What was\nneeded were a large number of\nposters around college.\nIn addition, there were no\nplacards or an IC banner which\nmeant that all traces of IC,\nbar a slop shirt dangling from\na ripped off branch, were lost\nin the crowd.\nThis cannot be very good\nfor IC's image.\nYours,\nR. Hasler,\nB. Speed,\nM. Smith.\n(It is indeed gratifying to see\nthat at least someone has\nwoken up to the fact that, with\nFELIX in its present form I cannot possibly fulfil the\nduties of a Publicity Officer \u2014\nEd.).\nFELIX \u00a9\nMichael J.

Farts\nscored almost straight away\nfrom the restart the ref said he\nsaw the knock-on but wanted to\nlet them equalize, they converted to give them a64 lead.\nscored for the A's to put\nthem back in the lead. Then\njust before half-time Farts\nscored but after having the\nthe linesman's flag stick up\nhis anus the ref disallowed it\nand blew for half time (8-6 for\nthe A's). The linesman explained that he couldn't drink\nand run the line properly at the\nsame time but we believe the\nFrog was more interested in\nsitting on leaves and catching\nflies. Bo-Bo tells me he's not\ngetting enough mentions so I will inform you that he was\nhogging loads of ball just like\nhe wants to hog this report.\nAt half-time while A. Clapham\nhad a couple of drags, the\noranges were served, on a table, and Bo-Bo told the\ncrowd that he was glad of the\nsupport and encouragement they\nwere giving him.\nAfter the restarts.Hindmarsh\nscored after about 4 knock-ons\nby R. Neal (12-6), B. Pants\ncontinued to spec tate well and\nBo-Bo wants another mention.\nSt. Farts nearly scored from a breakaway but their winger\nstopped so that R. Jones could\ncatch him up and was promptly\nflattened by half a dozen A's players. R. Jones was e nio ving himself going round running into their players until he\neventually winded himself, and\nhe did not shout at M. Gibson\nfor fastening his boot lace. Farts did score once more by\nM. Gibson, R. Beddoes and\nbelieve it or not A. Clapham\nscored a try each one of which\nBo-Bo managed to convert\nalong with a penalty to give\nthe A's victory with a final\nscore of 29*10.\nAs the final whistle blew\nthe Crowd invaded the pitch\nto mob their heroes and Farts\nhave been told to put up\nfencing to stop such incidents\nhappening again. 1,000 of the\nspectators in the form of Pete\nStutter-Medhurst joined the\nteam in the bath \u2014 it's hard\nwork spec ta ting, especially\nif you do it as well as B.

Our first\nteam secured a memorable 7th position by use of a tactical\ncombination of breast stroke\nand front crawl, while the\nsecond team just failed to\ndouble that figure. The third\nteam just failed, in spite of the\nboost \u2022 caused by the pincer\nmotion applied by the meta-carpels of Mr. L.S.E. Gledhill\nto the anal quarters of our very\nown Ronald, midway round the\nsecond leg (of the relay).\nHowever, the aforementioned\nharriers must be credited with\ntheir astounding victory over\na couple of Primary School\nteams.\nBack next week (we hope).\nRob Jones Dae to adverse weather\nconditions 90% of all sports\ngames were cancelled last\nSaturday. In fact the only game\nplayed was an away fixture for\nthe A XV Rugby. As there is a distinct lack of reports, I thought I'd take this opportunity\nto give a brief resume of the\nsuccess/failure of the various\nclubs.\nThe Soccer club having lost\ntheir first game embarked on a series of wins which has\nextended over at least seven\ngames. This achievement is all\nthe more remarkable (?) when\nyou consider that they have\nplayed all season without the\nguidance of their world famous\ncaptain (Steve Bates).\nThe Rugby Club have\nalready been knocked out of the\nMiddlesex Cup, and have won\nas many games as they have\nlost, and last Wednesday they\nstarted their long trail to\nregain the Gutteridge Cup.\n' The Hockey (Hanson) Club,\nlike the RFC have had a mixed\nseason so far, winning five\nfrom nine games. The XCountry Club now hold the\nrecord for sending the most\nletters to FELIX, but also have\nbeen performing well.\nAll in all IC seems to be\nmaintaining its high standard\nin sports and things are looking\nexceptionally good for the\nsecond half of the winter\nseason.\nP.S. Let's reports!\nhave some more\nSTOP PRESS\nThe Board of Studies in their report for the next quin que num have put forward proposals for joint-honours degree courses with the aim of attracting more women at IC. Also, with the\nsame aim is the Administration's Committee whose attack is totally directed at all female schools. On a more sour note, there is talk of rents going up to between \u00a36-50 and \u00a37.00 next\nyear for hall residents. "

The crowd attendance was only moderate-a pity considering the magnificent display of football\nskills that were to come.\nHowever, the few fans that did\nbrave the weather, were\nagitated with excitement;very\nfew of them could stand still\nin that tension. There was\nvirtually no crowd violence, so\nit did not really matter that the\nlocal constabulary weren't present. The only piece of\nmisbehaviour was the way that\na number of fans constantly\ninvaded the pitch, but apart\nfrom one who looked ready to\nuse a stick on the football\nstars, there were no apparent\nsigns of hooliganism*\nThe Ladies won the toss\nand. elected to kick off. The\nExec chose to play into the\nbookings one for dissent, the\nother for sitting on the penalty\nspot but then showed us his\nfootballing skill with a wonderful chip shot that dipped\nunder the bar. However, a penalty and a headed goal left\nthe Exec 5-4 up at QuarterTime.\nDuring this interval the\nstars decided to meet their\nfans, obviously taking a lead\nfrom Leeds. Mr. A. Sudworth\n(not again) was approached by\ntwo 'gentlemen' in trendy gear,\n'Oh, haven't you got nice legs'\nsaid one. His friend was quite\njealous. I hope Sudworth is\nregretting the 'meet-the'fans'\nnow, as it will only alienate\nwind. It was quite clear that\nthe referee would have to take\na firm hand to keep the two\nsides apart \u2014 never has this\nStadium seen such an expanse\nof feminine thighs. The referee\nshowed that he would not\ntolerate in discipline on the\nfield. Within minutes he had\nallowed a goal, disallowed\nanother and booked Nick\nPayne for arguing. It was a gem\nof a first goal \u2014 a splendid run\ndown the wing by A. Sudworth\nand rammed home by P. Teague\nwho had gratefully accepted\nthe cross.\nAfter the Exec had had\nanother goal disallowed for\nScore at Eighth-Time 3-3*\noffside, they went two ahead\nthrough Payne running in from\nthe wing. But the Ladies were\nnot despondent, they came back\nwith two quick goals \u2014 the first\none a controversial penalty\ndecision and the second a neat\nlittle dribble over the line when\nthe Exec defence was in tatters.\nMiss E. Graham was the scorer\nboth times. Both teams scored\nagain before the whistle for\neighth time. The only things\nthat had spoilt a first eighth of\nspl ended football, was a vicious foul on Miss C. Morrell\nwhich earned Sudworth a booking, and an even more\ndiabolical knee-high chop by\nC. Pollard (Exec) who then\nstarted arguing with the referee\nand was promptly sent off.\nThe second eighth was a scrappy affair. Martin Kessler\n(Miss) earned himself two\nthem if the stars insist on\ncoming between friendships!\nMany of the ladies had similar\ncomments thrown at them: 'If\nyou walk round like that any\nlonger, you'll get done in'.\nOne supporter invited Miss C. 'Blush' to 'go for a bit in the\npark'. After the interval many\nof the ladies failed to appear.\nSome were receiving treatment,\nothers were taken out for meals\nby the fans.\nIt was in the next session\nthat the best football was\nplayed. Nick Payne was the\n'wingless wonder' with some\nbeautiful feints and deft little\ntouches. The Ladies finally\ngot on top, however, despite\ntheir depleted numbers, Miss\nM. Kessler getting a hat-trick\nin six minutes. He was finally\nsent off though, for his persistent dissent, and P. Teague\n(Exec) also had his name taken\nfor the same offence. N. Payne\ncompleted his hat-trick shortly\nbefore the whistle went for\nexponential-time.\nScore at Exponential Time:\nLadies 9-Exec 8.\nA penalty-competition\nfollowed during the interval but\nno-one really won, although\nN. Davies came nearest to it.\nThe match was abandoned at\nthis point because the referee\nconsidered that the crowd was\ngetting too large for safety\nwithout police control.\nReceipts: \u00a3429 (Ground record)\nPropositions: Ladies 3-Exec 1.\nMan of the Match: A.R.

This decision\nhas been forced upon us by the attitude of the authorities,\nmore than anything else. The situation was that we had been\ngiven permission to hold a procession, and were to have been\naccompanied along the route by the police. However, these\nsame police would have b den issued instructions to the\neffect that we would not be allowed to collect or sell rag\nmags. If anyone were caught doing so, he/she and the\nCommittee would have been arrested. This fact alone does\nnot worry the Committee that much, as it is difficult to\nimagine the police taking a group of students to court for\ncollecting for charity (what would the Da/7y Mirror say?).\nIt is for long term reasons that this decision has been made.\nFirstly, and assuming that we had been arrested (which is\nextremely probable), it is very unlikely that we would have\nbeen granted even a licence to hold a procession next year,\nlet alone the necessary collecting licences. Furthermore,\nwho would then donate the lorries for the floats? It has\nproved very difficult this year, to find such donors (we only\nhad three lorries anyway), and who is going to give the\nlorries for a procession which was stopped by the police the\nprevious year?\nIn the light of these questions, the committee (on a second\nballot) has decided upon the cancellation of the procession.\nWe are very sorry to those who have already begun pre-pa rations, but we hope this will not discourage anyone from\nenjoying the rest of the week.\nJohn Downs,\nCarnival Co-or d in at or. And Now For The Good News.\nYES, Rag Week's with us again! One week of fun and\nfrolics as well as (hopefully) a boost to the amount collected\nso far this year. We hope that, you will partake of at least\nsome of the events organised, and generally have a good\ntime. We open the festivities with the Rag and Drag Oueen\nDisco tonight in the Concert Hall. Entry price is 2f Jp, or\nfree, of course, if you want to compete (entry forms from\nyour CCU V.P.). The traditional Chariot Race at Marble\nArch on Saturday morning, is followed on Sunday by an\nEvening with SCAB. For 25p, you can wander from\" jazz to\nfolk or from folk to jazz, or from the 'udi ble to the visible \u2014\nyes films! As well as a stock of Tom and Jerrys we hope to\nhave some slightly more suggestive visuals \u2014 come and you\nwill see what we mean (nudge, nudge, wink, wink). Anyway\nthis all happens on Sunday evening in the Union Building;\ntickets from your union office, or on the door.\nOn Monday, a Three-Legged Pub Crawl will sort the men\nfrom the boys from the girls. Entry forms will be available\nfrom the Union Lower Lounge from 6.30p.m. onwards, together\nwith suitable ropes, etc., if you don't bring your own. The\nCCU's will be organising their own Nites Out on Tuesday\nevening, so look to your notice boards.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Morphy Day Massacre takes\nplace, the Putney towpath being littered with limbs,eyeballs,\ntactical' nuclear missiles, etc. whilst the CCU boat clubs\npaddle about in the river. In the evening, Fred Wedlock, one\nof the very best entertainers on the folk music circuit is\nappearing at IC Folk Club, in the Union Refectory, so if you\nare at all into folk music, this is a must.\nThursday evening is occupied by the RCS Smoking\nConcert \u2014 wholesome family entertainment with plenty of\nsmut, wine, women and wine, and on Friday IF is staging a Vicars and Tarts Party (with food) in the JCR. You can come\nas a vicar or a tart, so, whatever your inclination, you will\nbe welcome (ducky).\nOn Saturday evening, and as a climax to the week, there\nwill be a Grand Barbecue in Beit Quad, with a cow on the\nspit, baked potatoes, and a disco in the Lower Refectory.\nThe cost for this extravaganza will be 40p in advance, or\n50p on the night (subject to advance sales) or just lOp if you\nonly want to go into the disco. As there's a limited number\nof tickets, get yours now from your union office.\nThe final event takes place on Sunday 1st December,\nwhen a sponsored Marathon Dance will be held in the Union\nLower Refectory. There is a prize of two tickets for the Ents\nConcert of your choice for the winner. Even if you can only\ndance for a couple of hours in the evening (when it will open\ninto a public disco) do get a sponsor form from your VP and\ncome along. For the keener ones, we should point out that\nfood and drink will be provided so all you need is a good\npair of shoes and abounding enthusiasm.\nRag Week is here. It's up to you to enjoy it, and the more\nyou partake, the more goes to rag. Enjoy yourselves.\n\n"

Polydor 2383 303\nTHE COVER of the album features\nthe new Petula Clark image with an\nattempted afro hairstyle haircut gone\nwrong.\nIf you did not go to this concert do\nnot bother to buy this album unless you\nare over 35 or a Pet Clark Soc member.\nThe poor backing is apparent from the\nstart to the extent that the popular songs\ncomposed by some of the best musicians\nof our time are almost un recognisable \u2014\nDear Gilbert please forgive her, she is\nas 'swee f as a button'. In the intervals\nbetween the tracks she embarks on\nmassive ego-tripping sessions. Mercifully, side one comes to an end, thus\nculminating approximately 20 minutes\nof torture.\nSide two continues in the same vein\nwhen she tries her hand or should we\nsay her voice at most types of popular\njive, and country and western music,\nbut most of the time she does anything\nbut succeed (plant growth would be\nstunted by this serenade!). We would\nadvise Miss Clark to plead ignorance if\ninquired as to the identity of the performer on this album.\nTo our great amazement and disbelief\nwe were still (but just barely) awake\nwhen this record came to an end. All in\nall atypical ninety-niner (the real root\nof X' SgX^-SQX-gO^O in pennies-no\ndarling not those?).\nRubettes: Wear Its 'At\nPolydor 2383 306\nAN ALBUM obviously directed at the\nteenage market, however, we would have\nthought somewhat below the average IC\nstudent. The album sleeve Is mediocre\nartistically and is a typical sales\npromoting gimmick complete with a serrated paper hat (their trade mark).\nAfter ten minutes listening (or even\nless) it becomes quite apparent that this\ngroup do not possess a style of their\nown as such. They make several half\nattempts at imitating various artists,\nhowever, there is little or no sustaining\npower in these and they Inevitably drift\nback into their monotonous stream\n(or Is it scream).\nAmongst the tracks are all of their\ntop of the pops hit singles. Judging by\nthe popularity \u2014 in the teenage group -of these singles one would expect this\nalbum to be reasonably successful.\nThe sad feature throughout this\nrecord is the lack of original thinking.\nIf you want to know how many permutations there are of the styles of the\nfollowing artists: The Rolling Stones,\nAlan Price, Elton John, The Bee Gees,\nand Say City Rollers'; do not work it\nout just check out this album. i Hie\nJohnny Jenkins: Ton-Ton Macoute\n(Polydor)\nHERE'S a mixture of voodoo and blues\nproviding in this case a very agreeable\nif somewhat er rie combination. Johnny\nJenkins is here supported by half of the\nAllman Brothers, Muscle Shoals and a few others besides which give the music\na good sense of depth when its required.\nNotable are Duane Allman who comes\nover well on slide guitar and Berry\nOakley on bass.\nIf it wasn't for Jenkins' refusal to fly\nanywhere he would have been in Otis\nRedding's support band as it was he just\nsupplied support when Otis was in\nGeorgia.\nThis record first came out in 1970\nafter Redding's manager arranged the\nrecording session in Macon with, in all,\nover a dozen musicians, the result giving\nall the atmosphere of the deep south, and\nplaying some well tried material. Dr. John\nCreaux's Walk on Guilded Splintes and\nJackie Avery's Blind Bats and Swamp\nRats laying down the voodoo; the blues\nRollin' Stone and Sleepy John Estes\nLeaving Trunk, even a Dylan with Down\nAlong the Core.\nMany of the tracks sound as though\nthey could go on forever especially with\nthe powerful obsessive rhythm set up in\nthe voodoo influenced numbers.\nThis record Is really worth a listen to\nbecause of the variation in the record\nand the obvious musical muscle ability\nof the artists who managed successfully\nto play together, the only lack perhaps\nis a libretto because some of the words\nare a little difficult to pick out, not that\nthat's very unusual for blues after all.\nTo sum up, thoroughly recommended.\nJulian Brook: 'Portrait' (Super).\nTHE FIRST vinyl of this singer-songwriter that I 've heard, but his second\neffort. He opens with 'Christenings,\nWeddings, Funerals' plus solid beat\na la Abbey road supported by a weird\nchorus aptly credited 'The Crikey Choir',\ncertainly been doing homework on the\nFab Fours chord sequences. What's this?\n'Sing it out across the nation'? Hmm,\nshades of deja eco ute. There's a nice\npiano intro on 'That's no Way', which\nstays to warm the song, and Elton\npianoforte on 'Endless Dreams' \u2014 pure\npink eyes. The music works best on the\nfaster numbers viz '/ Give The Game\nAway' in a 'pop' rather than 'rock' sense\nbut many of the songs from a reiterated\npiano sequence, and for this repetitive\nmethod to work the melody must be\nparticularly strong, which it sometimes\nfalls short of, resulting in an overall\nsameness to the platter.\nThe press handout says Julian Brook\ndescribes himself as 'the plodder* \u2014\ntoo true 3ruc e! Success will be elusive\nuntil the songs stand up to more than\nsuperficial scrutiny.\nHe adds strictly rudimentary accompaniment to the lyrics, but unlike Leonard\nCohen, here the poetry and imagery\naren't strong enough to make the songs\nsucceed.\nThe final offering 'Noticing' is\nsomething else. It is transformed by the\nexcellent flute-playing of Jimmy Hastings,\nwhose class shines through and could\nwell have been used throughout the\n40-odd minutes. It's a listenable album\nwith a certain French quality, ma is un\npe u plus d 'imagination s 'il vous plait,\nmonsieur Brook.\nSpike Milligan: 'On the Ning Nang\nNong' (Polydor)'.\nFROM HIS sold-out world wide tour,\nhis recently-released smash album\n'Badjelly the Witch and other Goodies'\nwe have for your de leg ability, 'Eccles'\nMilligan mumbling the harmless little\nditty 'On the Ning Nang Nong'. Beats\nthe hundreds of other candidates for\nthis honoured spot into oblivion. If this\nmakes it they could bring back sanity\nand re-release 'Eric the Half a Bee' \u2014\nand shut that bloody Bouzouki up,\nMr. Wensleydale!\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX PRE C3P3C E Trevor Phillips This term, I have tried to concentrate\non straightening out the existing structure\nof the Union, strengthening the fairly\nrickety procedures existing in some\naspects of the Union's work, and generally\nattempting to make the Union effective\nin its basic roles as a representative\nbody and decision-maker.\nOur political role has not been as\nstrident as it has been, perhaps properly\nso. Student Unions should pursue political\nactivities when these further the interests\nand aims of their members. Perhaps the\nexception is on international issues,\nwhich have, traditionally, a special\nplace in students* activities, in ter rh s of\nbar fundamental concern for international\npeace, and preservation of democratic\nfreedoms throughout the world.\nI am, however, disturbed about the\ndemise of the Left in IC.\" My own political\nposition has always been on the left of\nthe student body.\" Whilst I eschew the\nantics pursued by some of the Ultra and\nSilly Left, I believe that the correct way\nforward for students is through a perspective based on the involvement of the\nmass of students in campaigns for radical\nchange in all aspects of higher education.\nI adhere to that position both locally\nand nationally; but it is true that, as\nPresident, I no longer have the time nor\nthe freedom to act as I did as a 'grass-roots member' of the Union. This is only\nright. Initiatives and policy are the\nprerogatives of the membership, not the\nUnion bureaucracy. We work within that\ndemocratic structure; forged by the Left,\nin Student Unions. For instance, at IC,\nit was only through left-wing pressure for\ndemocracy in the Union that every student\nwas given the vote, in the late sixties.\nBefore that Council elected the President,\nHon.* Sec, and senior officers.\nThis year, there is no identifiable\nL: it caucus on Council. There is little\nreal pressure for radical change at this\nlevel. UGMs are now plagued by a mindless little group, who like to think\nof themselves as Conservative. However,\nthe spectacle of them casting panic-stricken looks at each other, every time\nthey have to vote on something is pathetic\nin the extreme, and says nothing for their\nconsistency, and questions whether they\nhave any views at all, besides that they\ndon't like 'Lefties'. I suggest tha't those\nwho do understand Toryism, (and I think\nthere is one person, at least) try to sort\nout this shambles, an uneasy coalition of\nliberals, right-wingers and extremist\nbuffoons, as they are an embarrassment\nto us all.\nIt is instructive to note that of all the\nstudents who said at hustings for the\nelection of our delegation to NUS Conference, that none of the right-wing\ncandidates took part in the formulation\nof motions on amendments, or tried to do\nso. (I am not including the RSMU element\nas seriously 'right-wing'). Furthermore,\nof the two 'Conservative' candidates, one\nhas withdrawn on finding that he is\n'only an observer' and the other implied\nthat he was not really interested in going\nanyway as it 'interfered with his social\nlife'. Does this sound as though they\nwere interested in representing the\nUnion?\nTo return to the left, I reiterate my\nbelief that the sensible perspective for\nstudents is a radical one, and that this\nmust he fought for at all levels. It is\ndisturbing to realise, as I have come to,\nthat the Administration of the College is\nconsiderably more progressive than the\nstudents.\nAs President I am not as isolated as\nI might have been. The Executive is not\nas rabid ly right-wing as some people\npredicted; in fact, it tends to be on the\nprogressive side. But it is the left-wing\nstudents on the floor of the Union who\nhave always won advances for students\nin all aspects of student work and\nconditions; the right has never been\ninterested in students' welfare, only in\nits own ego-trips. The left must 'stand up'\nnow.\nThe National Demonstration last\nFriday was, by any standards, a smashing\nsuccess. Where seasoned campaigners\n(including myself) for casted a low turnout\nof less then 10,000 students, two or three\ntimes that number were on the streets of\nLondon, showing their support for the\ncontinuing campaign for higher grants,\nand against the cuts in education.\nLocally, it was a dismal failure, as\nanyone could see. I myself predicted this\nas a response to the last grants award.\nIt is true to a large extent, that the big\nbattalions, the Universities, have fallen\nto the bribe that Prentice has given us,\nand us alone. Students as a body, sometimes do behave in a short-sighted and'\nignorant manner, even when it concerns\ntheir own interests, as in this case.\nVery few ordinary IC students have\napparently realised the dire threat posed\nby the cuts in the education to the whole\nof higher education. Very few IC students\nappear to realise the meaning of inflation\nor its effect (even at its present rate) on\nthe spending power of their grant. Some\nstudents have vague ideas that the Means\nTest is 'unfair'; but almost none seem to\nunderstand the vicious effects of it, and\nthe other anomalies in the grant situation,\nparticularly regulations that a cut ally penal is e students, time and time again,\nfor being married.\nWhen students come to me, as they do,\nin alarming numbers, to ask advice on\ngrant problems, I more often than not find\nmyself up against one facet or another,\nof a totally unjust Grants system. And\nthat can only be changed by active and\nvigorous \u2014 and, if necessary, militant \u2014\ncampaigning.\nj^ BBBBsssBeeseeBsi\nCont. from front page\nover the country on that day\nby their demonstration of\nsolidarity.\nJohn Randall told the\ngathering that a letter had been\nsent to Mr. Prentice calling on\nnim to award full grants to all\nstudents over the age of 16.\nHowever, he added that he was\nnot very hopeful of a favourable\nresponse and that this was all\nthe more reason for a renewed\nstruggle to achieve their aims.\nCalling on the government to\nimprove educational facilities,\nhe said, 'The student body\nrejects that this country is\npoor since many private conT\npani es are making bigger\nprofits than ever'.\nHe ended by calling on the\nstudents to 'fight for a better\neducation system, and fair\ngrants' and added, 'let this\nbe the beginning of our fight\nto show that we want fair\neducation system and fair\ngrants'.\nThe spirit of the march and\nrally was amicably summarised\non the NUS banner, which read,\n\u2022EDUCATE, AGITATE and\nORGANISE'.\nICWA\npresents a Christmas Lunch Party\non\nFriday, 6th of December\nfrom 12.30p.m. onwards\nin the Union Concert Hall\nTickets, price *0p from: Julia Dunning\u2014Beit 98\nJenny Newton\u2014Falmouth 146\nor from the ICWA lounge Friday lunch-times.\nCoffee will now be available every Friday lunch-time.\nfrom 12,30p.m. onwards in the ICWA lounge\neveryone, male and female is welcome.\nCONTRIBUTE A RECIPE\nAND HELP THE CRECHE!\nThe IC Wives' Club is\nhoping to bring out a small\ncookery book next Spring.\nThe profit from its sale will\ngo towards pro vl ding desperately needed equipment forthe c rec he.

Ultimately responsibility must lie with the\nUnion Executive which as a body should have realised that\na lot of publicity was needed to\narouse interest in the 'traditionally apathetic IC students'.'\nAn army of students\napproximately 30,000 strong\nwound their way along the\ntraditional route for student\ndemonstrations to Hyde Park\ncorner. A new feature of the\nmarch was the large number of\nstudents from colleges of\nfurther education Involved. The\nmarch passed without incident\ndespite the occasionally\nsuccessful attempts of the\npolice to split the group into\nseveral small sections. This\nunnecessary action caused\nfeelings to run high though the\norganisers may have been as\nmuch to blame. Inexplicably\nthere were virtually no stewards\nto supervise the march, this\ncould have been dangerous\nand should not happen again l The students regrouped in\nHyde Park for the speeches.\nThe group filled most of Hyde\nPark corner but all were able\nto hear clearly thanks to\nexcellent loudspeaker arr-an gem ents. The first speaker was\nDenis Skinner, (MP), of the\ntribune group in the Labour\nparty. He was followed by\nRichard Goodacre of the\nBirmingham College of\nEducation and John Randall the\nNUS President. One of the\nmajor issues dealt with was\nthe cuts in educational\nexpenditure. All the speakers\nstressed the absurdity and\nfutility of these cuts.\nThe gathering was told to\ncontinue their fight against\ndiscretionary awards; the\nMeans Test; the Spouses'\ncontribution; the anomalies in\nmarried women's grants and\nthe call for higher grants for\nall was reiterated with renewed\nvigor.\nDenis Skinner rejected the\ngovernment suggestions that\nthe cuts in education were\nnecessary. He called on the\nLabour party to withdraw the\none thousand million pounds of\nloans they have recently given\nto industry and scrap such\n'ludicrous' projects as the\nchannel tunnel.

It is understood that this company, part\nof KeyserUllmann, the merchant\nbankers, were considering\ndemolishing the building as\npart of a larger development\nplan for that area. But a number\nof leading theatrical personalities (including Sir Alec\nGuiness, who apparently took\npart in a picket) fought to save\nthe theatre through a well-co-ordinated campaign.\nIt was about 18 mont'ss ago\nthat the musical 'Hair\" had to\nbe cut short when the ceiling\nfell in (fortunately not during a performance). Some were\ndisturbed by the fact that this\nincident occured only 48 hours\nafter Peureula Investments had\nactually bought the side with\nthe view to develop it.\nBut be that as it may, the\ntheatre has now been completely\nrenovated at a cost of 'less\nthan \u00a3100,000 - well less'.\nThe building contractors Scott,\nBrownrigg and Turner were\nextremely happy with the\nresults they had achieved: a company representative said\n'That ceiling is now as safe\nas houses'.\nA three year lease on the\nbuilding has been given to\nWest End producer Bill\nKenwright, but it is basically\na tortuous deal since he will\nhave to outlay an estimated\n\u00a32,000 per week in order to\nstaff the box office, bars\netc. \u2014 the production costs\ncome on top of that.\nthe money to be spent on more\nhouses and student hostels.\nRichard Goodacre stressed\nthe hardships faced by\nstudents in further education\nestablishments as a result of\nthe discretionary award system\nand asked the students to\nfight against this facet of the\ngrants system.\nJohn Randall pointed out\nthat students face a struggle\nfor survival of their colleges\nand themselves. The former\ndue to cuts in the grants to\ncolleges and latter due to the\ntreatment of students as second\nclass citizens and the laughable\nsums they are suppose to\n'exist' on.

    "content": "'\u20224 Fi lIX Alan Lodge\nClub\nN.V. Harrison\nON MONDAY. 18th November, Dr. Tim Challis gave a horrifying picture on the subject of human manipulation in a talk\ncalled 'Riot Control in England Too?', giving depth to a subject\nthat mainly consists of short-lived rumours, with little or no\nofficial response.\nThe speaker started by\njustifying the 'England Too'\npart of the title. We have been\nlucky since 1945 in having\nexperienced slow growth\nconditions with little actual\ndisturbance. But this cannot\nlast; in a period of booms and\nslumps civil disturbance will\noccur. Dr. Challis felt that the\npossibility of a growing Fascist\nmovement among Industrialists\nor a Military coup is small. It\nseems more likely that the\ngovernment will have to take\nfurther action itself. But how\nwill it cope with picketing,\nwhich by sheer weight of\nnumbers can get its own way?\nThe British government is\none of the best at stopping\nnon-violent subversion such\nas picketing or riots in\nNorthern Ireland.\nBut it is generally felt that\ntheir methods are too extreme,\ndespite the way they are\nusually played down. CS gas\nfor one is largely taken for\ngranted now after the initial\nrumpus of its introduction, but\nthere is evidence to suggest\nthat it has lasting effects and\nis a carcinogen.\nRubber bullets sound harmless enough, but. apparently\nthree people have been killed\nand many permanently injured.\nThey conjure up suckers on\nthe end of toy bows and arrows,\nbut the Spanish police banned\nthem.\nThe next stage is armed\nconfrontation, for example\nwhen terrorists armed to. the\nteeth take over some building.\nAgainst such people, the\npolice are powerless.\nHowever, when they capture\ntrouble makers, the government\nis on firmer ground. Dr.\nChallis described one of the\nbest methods of preparing them\nfor interrogation. The subject\nstands in the usual police\nfrisking position, with a bag\nover his head and is exposed\nto loud white m oise. He is not\nallowed to sleep and is fed on\nbread and water. This treatment\nlasts for about three days.\nAnother highly successful\ntreatment is solitary con-fine ment. It does not take long\nfor hallucinations to set in,\nbut they have to stop before\ntheir subject goes insane; it's a delicate subject, wrecking\nhumans.\nBut this treatment is not\nsolely for true IRA men and\ntheir kin. The ordinary man in\nthe street in Ireland arrested\non incorrect information gets\nit too. We wonder why the\nordinary Irishman likes us\nso much.\nTHE LAST week or so has seen a number of happenings in the\nJazz Club. First on Sunday (10th Nov.) we had the appropriately\nnamed 'Scylla' to provide us with some rock music for the Sunday\nSessions. They are a five piece band (vocals, lead, rhythm, bass\nand drums) who played heavy, and perhaps a little too loud, rock.\nThe lead guitar playing was\ninventive and interesting but\nafter a while the music became\ntoo one-paced and the vocals\npractically inaudible.\nOn Thursday we had the\ndual events of a lecture by\nmaster musician Ian Carr (of\nNucleus fame) on 'The Increasing Influence of Rock on\nJazz', and the Jazz Club's Trad Jam. The former was a fascinating event. Ian talked\nabout music as being of two\ndistinct types: western and\nnon-western, Jazz being a fusion of the two. The characteristics that he emphasised\nfor western music were, as a written music, the possession\nof harmonic structure together\nwith the development and\nexpansion of a theme. Nonwestern music he saw as a multimedia experience with the\nmusic much more directed at\nthe audience, with the rhythm\nstructures more important than\nthe harmony. In the influence\nof rock on Jazz he saw non-western traditions re-exerting\nthemselves and rejuvenating a medium which was rapidly\nbecoming sterile. To illustrate\nthese points he played several\nrather scratched records which\ncovered the works of Miles\nDavis, John Coltrane, and\nCharlie Mingus but for me the\nhighlight of the proceedings\nwas a superb song by Howling\nWolf called 'Smoke Stack\nLightning' which was his only\nexample of 'rock' music.\nThe Trad Jam was an\naltogether less competent\nperformance, with a distinct\nlack of musicians despite the,\nfree beer on offer. However, it\ncan at least be said that those\nwho did tum up enjoyed themselves even though the\nrepertoire was rather limited\n(tin roof blues, tin root blues\nand yet more tin roof blues).\nNest week at the Sunday\nSession we have 'Handbag'\nguesting.

I have already aired some\na, iT py a' e rW\n!\u2122ncL he, Subject in FELIX last week: h av\nin9 received\nquite a response from comments, I felt I should like to continue my views in this issue.\nIn particular, it struck me\nas rather ironic that the front\npage of last week's FELIX\ndrew attention to sex discrimination within the grant's system and how we should all\nfight this (I am referring to\nmarried women's grants) \u2014 and\nthis coming from a college\nwhich has only allowed women\nin its Union Bar in the last two\nyears (although there was never\nany union policy on this), and\nwhere in only the last two\nweeks rumours of a move to\nclose the Bar to women yet\nagain were flying around. The\ngenerous minded of these\n'gentlemen' suggested that\npossibly it could be reduced to\nhaving just one or two nights\na week 'men only'.\nHave you ever heard the\nlike of it?! other than out of\nhistory books. And what, you\nmay ask, is the reason behind\nthis ridiculous proposal? None\nother than some men feel they\ncannot 'let themselves go' in\nthe company of women. The\nphrase In inverted commas\nseemingly includes becoming\ninsensible with drink, followed\nby puking up over the Bar\nfloor, to be refreshed by the\ndrinking of a yard, all ending\nup with the customary stripping\noff of all their clothes i.e. those they've got left on.\nWell, far be it for me to\npoint this out, but I have yet to\nsee such embarrassment displayed by the regular Bar\ncustomers and if it exists then\nso much the better. Perhaps it\nwill start a decline in what\ncan only be described as a totally barbaric and senseless\nritual supposedly elevating the\nparticipators to the giddy ranks\nof 'being a real man'?? The\nbasis for this assumption fails\nme completely since a14 year\nold kid is perfectly capable of\ndrinking himself silly, being\nsick and stripping.\nAnd if this ritual is the\ncause for the movement to ban\nwomen from the Bar yet again.\nI suggest they also move to\nlower the legal drinking age to\n14 to include men of similar\ncapabilities in this initiation\nceremony to manhood.\nVF Only:.\nKatie McKinnon\nLadies and ....Ladies!\nCAN YOU tell the difference between Betty and Marg? Three\nout of four people can't. Who would guess that Betty, with long\nauburn curls, gold lame top with matching velvet hip-hug gers is\nreally Freddy in disguise? In fact, Freddy and those like him\nseem to be making a much better job of being women than women\nare. What has happened to the\ncharm of a bared ankle, fluttering eyelashes, the look of\nhelplessness and complete\ndependence which once conquered a man far more effectively\nthan any Women's Liberationist\ntactics? Have we indeed lost\nthe art of being feminine? Are\nwe in danger of becoming a Unisex Society?\nIt is no use going about\nthings in a bull-in-a china shop\nfashion, a mistake too often\nmade by our American friends.\nAsk any man what Heaven on\nEarth is and he will say 'Living\nin England on an American\nwage with a Japanese wife' \u2014\nand Hell? 'Living in Japan on\nan English wage with an\nAmerican wife'. Our Japanese\ncounterparts have long since\ndiscovered that subtlety holds\nthe answers.\nFirst of all we Jadies must\naccept the fact that God did the\ndirty on us by giving us the\ntask of reproducing the species,\nso that from the word go we\nstart off at a disadvantage.\nBut never a woman existed who\ncouldn't turn a disadvantage\ninto an advantage. From the\ncomfort of her own home a woman can run a husband, a business, a town and indeed an\nentire nation! The sky is her\nlimit. Why is Heath having such\ntrouble maintaining his political leadership? Simply\nbecause without a wife to tell\nhim how a country is run he is\nlike Little Boy Blue without\nhis horn. 'Behind every great\nman is an even greater woman'.\nHow true. You see this is\nwhere women excel. It is quite\nevident that we alone are the\nreal leaders of the world (think\nof Cleopatra, Elizabeth 1,\nVictoria, Mata Hari and Mary\nWhitehouse) but we are clever\n1\nEl\nEl\nGl\nEl\n5\n1\nEl\nEl\nEl\nHelen Fogerty decorates\nthe ranks of Materials Science\n1, and hails from Morpeth which\nis (for southerners who speak\noddly accented English) north\nof Newcastle.

How simple\nand unassuming! However, we\nare in danger of losing our\ninfluence because instead of\nusing our female charm and\nhighly developed powers of\nwhining and wheedling we are\ntrying to compete with men on\ntheir own ground. The common\noutcry from girls at IC is that\nthey do not get a fair deal, but\nhow many are guilty of looking\nmore like men, of mucking in\nwith the lads, drinking beer by\nthe yard and walking along as\nif they'd just stepped down\nfrom a horse? Establish your\nidentity first and then assert\nyourselves. In the Battle of the\nSexes nothing but sheer\nscheming and cunning will\nsucceed and who is better at\nthat than us?\nYou see at best a woman is\nan enchanting, mysterious,\nbewitching, exacting, dec-or at ive, sweet-smelling,\nirrational sort of creature, from\nthe top of her coiffure to the\ntip of her painted toenails. At\nworst she is a giggly, sloppy,\nsnivelling, empty-headed, foul\nsmelling, gum chewing biped \u2014\nand about as enchanting as a skunk on a hot day.\nJust to demonstrate how\nsuccessful we girls can be\nwhen we put our minds to it I will remind you that not so long\nago IF collected more per\nperson for rag than any other\nUSK college. However, never\nlet it be said that we do anything by halves and this year I should think we have collected\nthe least per person. Today\n(Sunday 17th). was an outstanding example. A three-legged football match was\narranged as a rag stunt in Hyde\nPark. How many goodly females\nfrom IF got off their spoilt\nbottoms to kick a ball around\nfor charity? Six. Say no more.\nHowever there will be many\nmore opportunities to show\nyour willing in the near future.\nNot least the chariot race down\nOxford St. tomorrow (Saturday\n23rd) and of course our very\nown VICARS AND TARTS\nPARTY on Friday the 29th in\nthe JCR from eight o 'clock\nonwards. There will be a disco\nand some food, and drinks will\nbe obtainable from the bar. The\nentrance fee will be a mere 30p and the proceeds from this will\nbe going to rag. Prize for the\ngrooviest vicar and the most\ndelectable tart?\n\n"

P. Photographs by Roger Wilkins At last, Theta has been returned to its\nrightful owners after a month's vacation\nin the grips of Guilds. After the somewhat\neasy snatch at the Maths Freshers Dinner,\nGuilds put into operation a treasure hunt\nfor RCS by which they would get Theta\nback. The conditions of the hunt being\nthat only the exec of RCS, Pete Teague,\nM Xessler and Nick Payne were the\nor ii j ones eligible to.collect the clues\nand that each clue would cost \u00a35 towards\nGuilds Rag Fund.\nSo one week after the snatch, the first\nclue was sent telling RCS to listen into\nthe Kenny Everett's Morning Show on\nCapital for their first clue. So at 6.30a.m., RCS set tape recorders in motion for 2V2 hours listening to the programme but\nKenny Everett being Kenny Everett did\nnot broadcast the clue and so if anyone\nwants 2'/2 hours of Kenny Everett on tape\n(in triplicate) see RCS.\nFinally, RCS were given the clue and\nsent to the Tower. After fifteen minutes\nof Mr. Teague trying to get the next clue\nfrom a Beefeater, the Beefeater finally\ngave in and handed their next clue over\nafter receiving \u00a35 plus \u00a31 for the\nYoeman's Charity Fund.\nSo clue in hand Mr. Teague sped off\nto the Queens pub with the usual \u00a35 and\ntwo flowers with a bit of fern attached\n(meant to be two bouquets) for the\nbarmaids. They were then sent on a rather\nwet and windy Wednesday to the Serpentine\nto surrender \u00a310 for the next clue. The\nclue being on the Serpentine inside a whisky bottle though Jenny and other\nGuildsmen stood on the bridge watching\nthe antics of Teague and his merry man\nin a boat. Then it was off to Ongar (i.e. at the very end of the Central Line) for\na \u00a35 postal order from Ongar Post Office.\nSo Pete Teague, being a true and loyal\npresident of RCS, made a presidential\ndecision and sent Martin Kessler off on\nthis mammoth Tube Journey. Three trains\nlater, he arrived at the post office to find\nit just shutting for lunch. So after an\nhour's lunch break, he got the postal\norder and. set off on the return journey.\nTheir next ci ue sent them to the Post\nOffice Tower with \u00a35 and a bouquet of\nflowers for the receptionist, then the\nDove at Hammersmith with \u00a35 plus a drink\nfor every woman in the bar. This was\nfollowed by a trip to the Pole's daily\nnewspaper, the Daily Telegraph at\n11.00p.m. for a copy of the following\nday's newspaper and -a \u00a35 cheque.\nThen off, one Sunday night, to South\nKen tube'station to find that they had\n1\n'\n/\n> hours to get into drag and appear In\nthe Union Bar at Guilds Bar Night. They\ndid look nice, better than usual in fact.\nAnd so to the actual return, held a week last Thursday in the Beit Quad. At\n1.00p.m., Teague, Kessler and Payne\nwaited In the centre of the quad, keeping\ntheir eyes on windows in case water\nshould cascade from them, for their first\nsighting of Theta in a month, now in\nGuilds Colours.\nRent-A Bang then stepped in and with\na small explosion, heralded the arrival\nof the RCS mascot, closely guarded by\nGuilds. It was then handed over and\nchained to Kessler and carried away,\nescorted by Teague and Payne carrying a pickaxe and a steel rod respectively, to\nan awaiting van. Theta was whisked\naway to the ex hoes of a Boomalaka in\nthe Beit Quad and the result of all this,\n\u00a352 to Guilds Rag Fund and holes in the\npockets of RCS.\nThe Great\nHome - Coming\nTheta is back with its rightful owners\nat last, and is being repainted in the\nregal colours of black, purple and white,\nto replace the deep puce and blotchy\nblue in which it was covered when\nreturned. Congratulations to Guilds on\nputting a little life into the method of\nreturning stolen mascots. I bet your blood\nhas not flowed so freely since you lost\nyour lump of brass last year. We learnt a lot of interesting odds and ends on the\nhunt, for instance, if you ever happen\n(God forbid) to be in Chipping Ongar, I can thoroughly recommend Bill's Caff and\nthe local pub. Undoubtably the highlight\nof the chase was the RCS Exec's appearance in drag in the Union Bar. Didn't we do well?! \u2014 ex pec i ally since we only\nhad 70 mins. in which to prepare. No\nprizes for guessing what we do in our\nspare time!! At the end of the search,\nTheta was returned in a blaze of pub*\nli city in the middle of Beit Quad. In view\nof the presence of so many people, it was\nchained up and spirited away Into a van\nwhich drove off at high speed, closely\nfollowed by a Guilds Mini and a Mines\nCortina. Mines, displaying their normal\nintelligence, crewed their chase car with\none miner and one RCSU Theta Bearer!\nAfter several high speed U turns in\nQueensgate, the procession moved off at\na leisurely 50mph to Piccadilly, where\nafter losing the Cortina, we did another\nU turn across only 4 lanes of traffic and\nreturned to Hyde Park via .Victoria. In the\npark we collected a second van and with\nour two vehicles about'two yards apart\nreturned to Victoria, where we turned up\na narrow side street and while the first\nvan drove off the second stayed put and\nthe poor mini was unable to get past.\nSo unlucky! After this Theta was taken to\na safe place without any further trouble.\nWe think that Guilds benefited from\nthe hunt almost as much as we did, it\nwas not i cable that the standard of English\nand typing in the clues improved as the\nsearch went on. Keep it up. Guilds, best\nof luck with your next attempt at CSE\nEnglish. (Oh, Bitch!).\nSeriously though, many thanks for the\nfun. It really was fun most of the time,\nwith the noticeable exception of rowing\non the Serpentine in the pouring rain and\nwe hope to be able to do the same for you\nin the near future.\n\n"
