    "content": "22 Film 30 November 1998\nReviews\nThe Negotiator \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nStarring : Kevin Spacey, Samuel L Jackson\nDirector: F Gary Grey\nI 've seen my fair share of hostage\nnegotiation films - Die Hard has to\nbe one of my favourite films of all\ntime. However, I like it for the clever bits\nin the plot and the action. It's just a bit\nof fun: it never feels, well... real.\nThat's where The Negotiator comes\nin. It tries its hardest to stick to the rules.\nNo psychotic off duty cops taking on an\narmy of bad guys single handedly. At\nworst, it's one man trying to talk down\nthe villain before everything breaks down\nand the hard boys are sent in. The bad\nguy doesn't stand a chance.\nDanny (Samuel L Jackson) stands a better chance than most. He's a negotiator him se if, so he knows all the rules\nof engagement. He was framed fot the\nmurder of his partner soon after his partner found some evidence of corruption\nin the police force. So, he marched into\nthe inspector's office and is holding him\nhostage until he gets his answers and\ncan clean his name and seek revenge.\n(Murdered partner... framed... revenge...\nnn ngh! Far too cheesy...)\nThere are some great comic bits as\nthe other negotiators struggle to deal\nwith someone who's an expert in this\n\"Sablan. Get me Sabian\". Now that's what I call script.\nkind of situation. Sabian's( Kevin Spacey)\nfirst scene is quite funny too, as he tries\nto talk his wife out of the bathroom and\nhis daughter off the phone. Kevin Spacey\nis quite good throughout. He always\nlooks scar i ly efficient, which is just what\nthe character should be.\nCharacterisation is what the film's about after all. It compares Jackson's \"Do\nsomething and change the situation\"\napproach to Spacey's \"Let's sweat it out\nfor a while\". And then again with Commander Beck (David 'Bad guy in Twelve\nMonkeys' Morse), who just sends in the\ntroops at thc first hint of trouble. The\nproblem is, thc character is ation never\ngoes much deeper than this. As a result,\nyou never really care what happens to\nthe main players. You should probably\nfeel for Jackson, since you know he's done nothing wrong yet is still being\ntreated as a villain - but you never really\ndo. At some points I wished they'd just\nshoot him and get it over with.\nThe main problem with The Negotiator, though, is that it doesn't really\nexcel at anything. You never really feel\nshocked or in suspense. The action bits\nare quick and brief, which is probably\nrealistic, but not much fun. The plot does-n't have any huge twists in it: a few\nclever jinks and sidesteps to throw you\noff the scent maybe, but nothing drastic.\nIt's a film which will maintain your interest for the duration, but don't expect to\nbe astounded by it. D Andy\nThe Slums of Beverly Hills * *\nStarring : Natasha Lyonne,\nDirector: Tamara Jenkins\nW hy does every film with a budget under twenty million bucks\nfeel obliged to be so self-con-sci ou sly 'arty'? It seems that every low\nbudget US film has to force itself into a set of fixed rules for so called 'in de pen dent' movies, forget the fact that Slums\nof Beverly Hillswas in fact bankrolled by\nFox (one of thc biggest media groups in\nthe world), and cue up bizzar e music, a nonsensical plot, a seventies setting\nand lots of conversations about breasts.\nAh yes, breasts, the driving narrative\nforce behind Slums is Natasha fy onne's doubts over said part of her anatomy and\nthe problems they cause. She asks all and\nsundry their opinion, and seems to\nspend all her time trying to hide them,\nhave them surgically reduced or pretend\nthey don't exist. And, of course, along the\nway she manages to lose her virginity,\ngain an insight into those around her and\ngrow to love her family. How very American.\nMeanwhile, her father (Arkin) has\nhis own set of financially orientated problems, forcing thc family to move from\nshoddy apartment to shoddy apartment\nevery time he can't afford thc rent, t vent u ally he stoops to taking in his drug\naddled niece in return for monthly\ncheques from his brother. Although this\nallows them to move into a much nicer\nflat, it th tows up a new set of (entirely\npredictable) problems.\nIn principle, this probably isn'ta bad\nmovie, providing a nice example of the\nlengths people will go to to protect their\nchildren (Arkin insists on living in Beverly\nHills to ensure his kids get to go to a good school), plus some nice comic\ntouches. However, the clear insistence\non producing something that can be\nlabelled as 'indie film-making' swamps\nthe dramatic thrust in meaningless, pointless gibberish: the staccato Mexican-influenced incidental music rapidly begins\nto grate; thc performances are driven\nneedlessly over thc top; and the film\neventually eschews un be liev ability to\ndrown instead in a sea of schmaltz. Oh,\nand why is it set in thc seventies?\nIn essence, this is pretty standard\ncoming-of-age-drama fare which, in the\nhands of the tight production company\n(Film four or the BBC for example) could\nhave been a good and successful movie.\nSadly, however, the world doesn't work\nthat way, and US producers quite happily\nthrow money at anything they consider\n'indie' just to clear their conscience. Oh\nwell, yet another thing to blame on\nRupert Murdoch. D Dave\n\n"

Despite an\nhour long delay in starting, the awesome explosions that heralded the opening act set in motion a wave of\nirrepressible excitement that swept over\nall occupants of thc Great\nHall throughout last\nMonday evening.

However this biased |\ntone left the non-Asian minority I slightly bewildered\nby subtle references and jokes.\nWith all proceeds going to\ncharity (thc money'\nraised is being shared between |\nthe British Heart foundation5 and the Pulse Appeal), the)\norganisers set out to create a 'successful\nand entertaining show... serving only to\nhighlight the positive in both cultures\nand Ideologies', from the outset, the\nacts attempted to portray a vibrant contemporary image. Throughout the\nevening, they illustrated the persona of\nion, but utilised numerous innovative\nvehicles to present a spectrum of style\nwhich ranged from traditional Asian dress\nto the urban street styles paraded by the\nfeisty models. The audi-| en ce was treated to a I show of pouts, sultry\nstares and exhibitionist\n' poses, as they strutted their\nstuff on thc podium. The presentation of a wide array of\nI colourful garments was one of\ns! the major themes of the show\n|with numerous catwalk ses-1 s ions punctuating Ihe\nI evening. The clothes, pro-Iv i ded by Ciro Citterio. were\noften complemented by the\nwearer's demeanor, the sultry\nI iridescence of the 'Salmaan'si suit' as he rolled out the slick\nw vocals of 'One for the Money'\nbeing a case in point. Altogether, thc confident a nci vibrant routines sparkled with a i professional finish.\nThe careful choreography\nI of many of the dances was\nI certainly evident from the\n\\ intense concentration on the\nfaces of many routines' expo-n ents.

The pseudo-pan-to mime 'Surinderalla' for instance was a soundly written showpiece, which poked\nfun at the various controversies within\nand surrounding the Asian college com-m unity. The writers made use of sexual\ninnuendo with reckless abandon, not\nonly to guarantee laughs, but also to\nhighlight the pros and cons of issues\nsuch as arranged marriages and early\ntaken to indulging his exuberant\ncharisma, which soon led to verbal battles between himself and the crowd.\nThis banter added a unique, sometimes\nuncomfortable, but often dynamic aspect\nto the night. As the atmosphere intensified, a showdown occurred with a puerile\nspectator brandishing a laser point et on\nthe sly.\nThe organisers receive their hard earned praise\ncurfews.

The companies will\ndevelop complete solutions for c com-mer ce based on the best available technologies and expand their sales channels\nto include each other's products and ser-vices.\nThe three-year America Online-Sun\nagreement also will increase distribution\nand development of Netscape's enterprise software for corporate customers.\nThe companies will use Sun's Java technology to offer AOL services on selected\nInternet devices, consistent with AOL's new \"AOL Anywhere\" strategy to make\nAOL compatible with any Java compatible machine.\nIn thc deal with Sun, AOL agreed to\npurchase systems and services worth\n$500 million from Sun throughout 2002.\nSun, meanwhile, will pay AOL $350 million in licensing, marketing, and advertising fees during thc period. \"When you\nput those pieces all together, I think it's a pretty compelling opportunity for companies to get thc infrastructure and the\ntraffic all together in one place and get\nto mat ket online big-time,\" said Sun CEO\nScott McNealy.\nGenerally, there has been a positive\nreaction to thc plans in thc industry-with\nmany seeing the new AOL as a possible\nchallenger to Microsoft's continued\nadvances into e commerce and the Internet as a whole.

It is clear\nthat the ICSMSU now exists purely to further the political interests of members of\nICSM staff, and not to benefit our stu-dents\". This is backed up by Mr Warren's view of Mr Ahmad's resignation, \"certain\nmembers of the union executive...took\nit upon themselves to force Seif from his\nposition, by continually undermining his\nposition, sometimes to people as high\nup as Professor Whitehouse [thc ViccPrincipall\".\nIt is known that complaints had been\nmade to Sarah Burnett [the ICSM Admissions lu to rl over the ICSMSU President's failure to appear at the ULU Med Group\nvisit to Cambridge to meet prospective\nclinical students, and consequently,\naccording to Felix's source \"it's not surprising that thc School's Senior Admissions lu tor told the Education Rep to\njump before other sections of the School\nAdministration started to push\". This view\nhas been confirmed by several other\nsenior sources, who corroborate the\nAdmissions Tutor's advice to \"jump\nbefore the ship sinks\".\nMeanwhile, elections to replace Mr\nAhmad and Mr Heeps took place on 19\nand 20 November. Since the elections,\nserious allegations of electoral malpractice have emerged, with ballot boxes\nfailing to materialise at the Charing Cross\nand St Mary's campuses. Furthermore,\naccording to thc few medical students\nprepared to talk to Ie lix, thc only ballot\nbox was in fact situated under Mr\nGayed's desk in the BMS Building, and\nproduced only on request. Indeed, it\nwould appear that hardly any medical\nstudents at any of the campuses - or\nindeed either of ICU's sabbatical officers - were aware that the election was\ntaking place. Mr Gayed refused to be\ndrawn on the precise number of votes\ncast, only stating that \"a fair number\"\nexercised their democratic right, electing\nLizzie Robinson as Secretary and Nick\nNewton as Vice President (Internal).\nSo what does thc future hold for\nICSMSU? Mr Warren feels that it is vital\nthat Medical students begin to examine\nthe problems that face their Union: \"I ask\nyou why things have been allowed to get\nthis bad\". Yet according to another senior\nunion figure, \"it is too late for ICSMSU...it\nis clear that as ICSM voted against the current ICU President that he has no desire\nto intervene and clean things up,- it must\nbe obvious to him that there are problems of both a representative and financial nature\". However, responding to this\ncharge the ICU President, David Hellard,\nstated that \"I find myself in a position\nwhere whatever I do someone will see\nit as being anti-medic.We're monitoring the situation, and are in close contact\nwith all the people involved, both inside\nand outside their Exec\". Mr Warren too\nnoted a cleat belief that there is a light\nat the end of the tunnel; \"the Union is not\nas strong as the executive who run it, but\nthe other way around; the executive is as\nstrong as thc student body it represents\nand serves\".\nFelix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB Internal tel: 58072 Internal fax: 48072 External tel & fax: 0171 594 8072 URL www.su.ic.ac.uk/Felix E mail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nPtinted at MCP Litho Limited.

    "content": "20 Arts 30 November 1998\nPAINTINGS BY ARMANDO GARCIA SEIJO\nCable Street Gallery\nVIA \"his selection of fourteen portraits represents two years of\nArmando Garcia Seijo's life\nprompted by his arrival in London\nfrom Seville. Each piece is very\npersonal; observations of friends\nthat he has made in England and\nthe family that he left behind in\nSpain. He has tried to express his\nknowledge of the subject's personality through facial expressions and body language, and\nhas succeeded in giving each\npiece a palpable personality. Simple backgrounds encourage the\nviewer to focus on the figures\nand, where more than one person appears in the painting, Seijo\nlikes thc observer to create their\nown narrative describing the significance of that moment.\nAll the exhibits are up for sale\nand it seemed strange to me that\nSeijo could part with these memories of people who are obviously so dear to him. However, as\nhe pointed out to me, he is only\nselling thc pictures and not the\nrelationships he has with these\nindividuals. I suppose he can\nalways buy a photo album.\nThe exhibition features a variety of distinctive people tang ing from\na Burger King worker (pic-tu red right) to identical\nbrothers. In the faces of\nThe Twins, Seijo has\nthe ability to articulate\ntemperament with his\npainting. The Family was\npainted at a time when\nhe was missing his relations in Seville. The imposing woman with a solemn\nreproduced an exact likeness but in everything\nelse these men appear\ndifferent, and you cannot help but pte s ume this to be an implication\nof the it chat act crs. In this exhibition,\nSeijo proves that he has\nboth mother and head of\nthe family, so not surprisingly occupies the central\nposition within the group\nof five. One of the more\nnoticeable pieces is SelFPortrait as a Dead Man.\nThe detail of this study\nshows the care and attention that\nArmando Seijo places in his work,\nalthough you are left wondering\nabout the motives for such a topic.\nThis exhibition occupies one\nof two rooms in the Cable Street\nGallery and p to vi desa stark contrast to the abstract work of Duncan Pickstock next door.\nPickstock's work (pictured centre)\nmakes for a very stylish exhibition\nalthough on its own it would lack\nthe in te test genet a ted by the disparity between the two collections. The studio complex is run for\nart promotion and not for profit\nand as a consequence it's free. So,\nif you happen to be on that side\nof town, It e commend you drop in\nfor a look around.

'Call-ing Occupants of Interplanetary\ncraft'? 'Close to You'? Their legacy of light\ns que e ky clean music brings back images\nof mid-seventies pop. They were the\nclassic 'Bland Band', representing middle\nAmerican wholesomeness and family\nvalues - a brother and sister combo\nchurning out adult nursery rhymes for the\ngeneration that taste forgot. Yesterday\nOnce More draws back the curtain to\nreveal their other side - the power struggles, drug addiction and despair behind\nthe pure white smiles.\nKaren Carpenter died fifteen years\nago of anorexia. She weighed only seventy eight pounds. The play is her story\n- the story of how her perfectionist\nbrother, domineering mother and her\nown self-hate led to her illness and death.\nLaurence Bouvard plays a strong, outwardly happy Karen w racked by self-doubt and insecurity. She is ably\nsupported by a cast who are convincingly\nAmerican (except when they're not supposed to be) and convincingly seven-ties.\nStage do cu dramas often drop in\ntoo many facts at the expense of per-for man cc and natural dialogue. Not thc\ncase here; the action is related in flashback during one of Karen's psychiatric\nconsultations. Despite jumping between\nthe present (1982) and various points in\nthe past, thc narrative line is never lost.\nThe billing is for a 'play with music'; this\nis provided by two slinky black-clad divas\nwith a backing of electric piano. They fill\ngaps between scenes harmoniously with\nmedleys of Carpenters' hits, which fit\nthe mood of thc play perfectly at that\npoint.\nIt's as c tio us play about a tragic\ndeath yet there is still room for some\nhumour to lighten thc tone. One of\nRichatd Catpenter's girlfriends has the\nimplausible name 'Randy Bash'. Claudia\nGarison, as the austere mother Agnes\nCarpenter, plays the morally upright indignant puritan to aT. The serious parts are\na sensitive study of the pressures of a career in the music business when mixed\nwith those of a stifling family devoid of\ncompassion. One theory as to the cause\nof Karen's anorexia was that she felt that\nall she could control was her weight - her\nbrother wrote the songs, her mother did\nthe books, all she did was sing. She\nbecame addicted to laxatives and\nobsessed with her weight. She slipped\ninexorably down the slope to tu in because her family could not face up to\nher problem. It's tear-jerking stuff. The\nproduction made me feel like reading up\nmore about the Carpenters as well as\nreminding me of their happy but haunting melodies.\nThis was my first visit to the Man in\nthe Moon as a theatre goer. In all my previous visits to this Chelsea watering hole\nI had never suspected it concealed a hotbed of the s bian activity, and how\npleased I was to discover that it did.

    "content": "30 November 1998 Music 17\nLabel Profile - East Side Jamz Records\nA prominent name in the drum'n 'bass\narena nowadays is the label Eastsidc\nJamz. Founded by DJ and producer ASides, Eastside has quickly built up a very\ntalented roster of young and established\nartists. Now the new album, celebrating\nthe \"best\" of the label, is out and is an\nawesome demonstration of what these\nguys ate capable of! All the tracks on this\nalbum are new and exclusive, so it is\nmore than just a recycled compilation of\nold tracks. A Sides recently came In to\nrecord a mix and interview for the Electric Cafe.\nWhat do you in terms of music?\nI 've been producing drum'n 'bass for\nnearly ten years now. I run two record\nmade happy hardcore, techno stuff. I'd like to spend some time trying other\ntypes of music, but I just don't have the\ntime. But now I am diversifying. I do the\nCyclone projects which are still\ndrum'n 'bass but more on the jazz side.\nI'm also getting into working with live\nmusicians.\nOf all the different types of electronic music, what Is It about drum'n 'bass\nthat particularly grabs you?\nI'm into my basslines, I like the technicality of it, and also what you can do\nwith the sounds these days. That's more\nof a technology thing but I am a technology freak. I like my buttons and sam-ple rs.I like to push the machines as far\nlabels, one of them's called Eastside\nRecords, the other one is called Fuse.\nThey've been up and running for about\ntwo years. We've done twenty two\nreleases on Eastside and we're up to our\nfifteenth release on Fuse.\nHow did you get Into music?\nI used to play the drums at school. I would put music through my headphones and then bang away! It all really\nevolved from there.\ni was just sodding around in stu-dios. I actually got a job on the YTS working with my uncle who is actually a reggae artist on Zion Train. He taught me\nthe ropes and got me introduced to the\nequipment.\nMy recording techniques evolved\nfrom those of early hip-hop music. You\nwould make records using a set of decks\nand looping the beats backwards and forwards and then just layering bits and\npeice s over the top. From there I got into\ndrum programming, started sampling\nand then moved on to a computer.\nDid you always make drum'n 'bass?\nIn terms of how the music has\nevolved, yes! Because drum'n 'bass was-n't always drum'n 'bass. In the early days\nit was hardcore. Drum'n 'bass now is a progression of the music that was. I 've\nas I can. Drum'n 'bass is demanding. It\ndemands a lot out of the equipment\nyou've got. It is a music that is forever\nchanging and pushing forward. It has\nnever been stuck in a rut.\nDrum'n 'bass has really made it Into\nthe spotlight recently. Many journalists\nseem to be poised and waiting for it to\nburn Itself out. What do you attribute to\nIts continued success?\nPeople like Roni Size give a good\nimage. I 've got a lot of respect fro them\nbecause they've done It the right way.\nThey're still there, doing their own thing.\nTheir music was good to start off with,\nbut they've been really well packaged.\nThey've got al the right people behind\nthem. Certain people have gone through\nbut then you don't hear anything from\nthem again. Alex Reece! What's happened to him? After a few top 40 hits\nhe's disappeared. DJ Crystal is another\nprime example. He was really good in his\nday, got lied up to a major label and\nnothing!\nHow do you DJ?\nI like to play right the way across the\nboard. I'm playing quite hard these days\nbecause it's difficult to find some good\njump up stuff that I like! I switch from one\ngenre to another and you'll hear all different styles, i don't care what the style\nis as long as the beat is good!\nDo you play regularly?\nYes! I 've done a lot of work overseas.\nI 've played three times in New Zealand.\nI toured the States this year, from Boston\nto Nashville - the home of country and\nwestern! I'm taking a break for a while,\nbut I 'll be picking up the DJing again\nsoon.\nWhat Is the difference between your\ntwo labels, Eastside and Fuse?\nI use is more hard and experimental;\nit's more dark and deep. Eastside is more\nrolling and good time music.\nEastside Is two years old. Was the\nalbum put together to celebrate the\nlabel's birthday?\nNo. It is like a stepping-stone for us;\na progression. Youcan only put out so\nmant twelve inches in a year. It's also so\nthat people start to take us a bit more\nseriously, so it's good for our profile. It\ngets our music to new audiences that we\ncouldn't normally reach. Because of the\nCD, we'll inevitably hit another market.\nEverything on the album is new and\nexclusive. It will not be coming out in any\nother form. We're also expecting to do\na similar album for Fuse Recordings.\nHave the artists grown with the\nlabel?\nCertain ones have. I'm all about\npushing them anyway. Some only have\na basic studio setup, so I say, \"Look. Come\nto my place.\" So I sit with them and work\ntogether with them. I'm always pushing\nthem. I'm bringing them new technology\nso they can make their music better. My\nstudio is a base and is open to all my\nartists. That in itself should push them fur-ther, because they will be able to get a better sound.\nIs there a certain sound or vibe associated with the label?\nYes. I think the artists know what I like. I do have the final say about what\ngoes where. I won't write the tracks for\nthem, but I can help them fine-tune a track in my studio.\nWhat advice do you have for people\nwanting to get Into music?\nGo out and buy your own studio! No\nseriously, do it all off your own back if\nyou can. tt depends on how much\nmoney you've got, but technology\ncomes cheap if you look carefully. I would say get a little setup at home so\nyou can do your own thing and work on\nyour own sound. Just send out demos to\npeople!\nMany thanks to A Sides and everyone at Eastside jam z and Main Source.\nLook out for the new album, Lastside\nJamz Volume 1, out now! a lick Competitions\nI. \u2022 : \u2022 \u2022 : .\n1:'. i\". \u2022 : \u2022\n; i.. si. \u2022\n: i.v d'. hocking\n\u2022 i<.r:a, i a!;.';!.\"! thai\nJust answer this question lor your\nchance to win a CD copy of the new\nalbum..,\nWhich of the following is a pseudonym for lar rvI lea td and his must* ?\nA.

This is quite similar\nto Jackie Brown but much better.\nTarantino now has competition.\nGeorge Clooney is Jack Foley, a career struck bank robber who has had\nthree previous convictions.

The only\nthing against this flick Is that at times the\njumps from past to present aren't always\nthat clear. The jokes flow in abundance\nand are always well timed.

    "content": "16 November 1998\nColumns\n9\nMedicine Matters\nPolitics is a strange concept and one\nwhich I am not sure that I can adequately define. It docs not make\nmoney (not legally anyway), it rarely\nrelieves human suffering and indeed is\nvery often a major contributing factor.\nYou cannot eat politics, drink politics or\nbreathe politics and yet people do and\nthrive. Politics seems to make the world\ngo around by some strange application\nof forces that even the brightest theoretical mathematician at IC would be\nhard pressed to explain.\nEverybody decries politicians; they\nare a hated, despised group. People with\npolitical ambition are considered un trust worthy, somehow unfit for a real job\nand rank with footballers and models as\nbeing top of the fair game list for tabloid\npapers. This being the case it seems\nstrange that there are so many politicians around with their\nnumbers, it seems, growing daily.\nNowhere can this phenomenon be\nseen more clearly than in the student\nactivities of Imperial College. Apathy rules\nsupreme, we are told, with one sabbatical position left unfilled, yet the other\nextreme can be seen in the vehemence\nwith which people debate the presence\nof medics at IC in Felix. Anyone judging\nthe level of political awareness by reading the letters page recently would be\nforgiven for awaiting the news of recent\nassassinations, as tempers seem to be\nrunning so high. How is such fer v our and\npassion possible with such apathy?\nThis politics is not limited to an interdepartmental level. Within the medical\nschool itself politics is rife. Not even I am\ninsensitive enough to risk quoting examples of back-stabbing\nNick Newton within the school because\nfinally things are starting\nto settle down, but I think that it is a shame that people are put off attempting to do jobs which they are eminently\nsuitable for because of the politics of the\nclub or society.\nSo, if clubs and societies are not\nforums for politics why do they have\nelections, what are the officers for and\nwhy do we have an elected union? Everybody who is at medical school is a member of the student union unless you\nspecifically choose not to be and the\nelected officers are there to serve you the\nmembers of that union, not themselves.\nThe captains of the sports' clubs run the\nclubs supported by anyone else the clubs\ncare to elect. Similarly presidents of societies run these societies aided by other\npeople. So Wade runs the student union\nfor the good of the students and is\nassisted in this by the other elected officers. It is not a secretive boys club for\nelected members only, it is set up to\nhelp do things for the students be it\norganise bops, represent them when\nthey are in trouble or anything else that\nstudents want.\nWhenever a student, be they at\nSouth Kensington, St. Mary's, Charing\nCross, Hammersmith, Silwood Park or\nany other site of Imperial College says\nthat they do know what the SU do or why\nthey exist it is a personal indictment of\nevery elected member of the union for\neither not doing your job or not telling\npeople what you can do for them. The\nstudent unions should be about service,\nnot self-service.\ncontinued from page 8\ning', and not everybody can do it. In\nthese kind of dreams the world is yours\nfor the taking. You can do absolutely\nanything you like, once you realise you're\nactually dreaming. I used to visualise a door before me, and then when I opened it, anything I wanted, person,\nplace or thing, would be on the other\nside. There are endless possibilities, limited only by your imagination. The only\ndownside is that this period of lucid\ndreaming only usually lasts for a short\nwhile. So you could wake up at a crucial moment, feeling really frustrated!\nMost people will have at least one lucid\ndream experience during their lifetime\nbut about 20% of the population arc\nregular lucid-dreamers having them at\nleast once a month.\nThe importance of dreams was\nrecognised centuries ago. In ancient\nEgypt around 2000 BC, dream temples\nwere built especially for priests to interpret the dreams of others. It was Sigmund Freud however who began the\nwork of understanding dreams in the\nmodern era. Freud believed that dreams\nwere manifestations of our deepest,\noften sexual desires, kept hidden from\nour waking minds. Carl Jung, another\nfamous psychologist disagreed with\nFreud by arguing that dreams were vital\nmessages designed to be listened to -not hidden away. He was convinced\nthat dreams help to reveal to our waking minds many of our deepest wishes,\nand by doing so, help us to fulfil our\nambitions. Many dream consultants\nbelieve that our dreams provide important avenues through which our psyche\nor subconscious can speak to us. They\nsay that dreams are another dimension\nof ourselves, available only to the\ndreamer. Flere are a few examples of\ndream interpretations:\nPresidential Talk-Back\n- Climbing dreams (such as mine)\nsymbolise ambition.\n- Dreams that involve the shedding\nof blood are actually positive, symbolising the completion of an ordeal or sacrifice and the beginning of the healing\nprocess.\n- Dreams of being naked have nothing to do with sex. They suggest vulnerability or emotional exposure.\n- Falling off a cliff or from a height\npoints to a feeling of powerlessness.\n- Erotic dreams involving celebrities\nand film stars arc harmless and simply\nindicate a need for excitement, so relax,\nmake the most of them and enjoy!\nMany great scientific and technological inventions throughout history\ncame as a result of dreams, pointing to\ntheir 'problem-solving' nature. Kckulc,\nthe famous chemist, whilst trying to figure out the structure of benzene, fell\nasleep. He had a dream about snakes,\nsuddenly one of the snakes curled\naround and seized its tail. He awoke and\nrealised that the carbon atoms in benzene formed a ring structure.\nThe best ways to remember and\nunderstand your dreams is to keep a dream diary. As soon as you wake up,\nwrite down everything you remember\nincluding your feelings, however jumbled up it may seem at the time. It's also\na good idea to note down the previous\nday's events. In the words of Freud,\ndreams are the 'royal roads to the mind1. In taking time out to discover what your\ndreams represent, you may understand\nmore about yourself.\nSo relax and enjoy the fascinating\nadventures created by your inner con-science!\nT he bulk of\nmy time this David Hellard\nweek has\nbeen spent in a confer- |\nen ce called STADIA (stu- J dent training and\ndevelopment in action). I What is blatantly obvious\nfrom (lie conference is\n1111\nio\\e iv \u2022 iji1 Ii ! i II , i University of Ion don is\nfailing massively. Your \u00a78\ncounterparts throughout\nthe country have access\nto training in what employees view as the 'key skills'\nthat students require above a degree\nto be successful in their job; we currently do nothing. Ideally by the end\nof my term I would like to have set up\nan equivalent, allowing students to\ntrain in a variety of subjects from presentation skills to IT.\nDuring my time there I also\nlearned a lot about how to set up a' job shop' and the different permutations that one might have. The idea of\nthis is to provide our students with a safe place to find any part-time work\nthat they desire and possibly holiday\nwork with major companies who they\nmight want to work for in the future.\nIf by the end of this year I haven't set\na budget and received at least half of\nthe sponsorship money to set it up for\nnext summer, give me a kicking.\nThe Jobshop will be in the west\nwing basement of Beit Quad and is\njust one of the many projects that we\narc planning, but as with many decisions we make, we work on the\nassumption that we know what students want. Are we right though? If\nyou feel that the\nICU President Union is not offering a service that\n:: it should tell us what you\nint. We are currently\n\u2022 planning for next year and\nI we need to know (pre si \u2122\n\u00ab dent@ic.ac.uk).\nI know that the issue\n- of Ihe Medical Union will\ninevitably come up in this\nissue.

Union\nand the scuffles in the\nMedical executive may be having an\nadverse effect on these clubs, but this\ncan be avoided. For years the clubs\nhave relied on their exec for help and\nadvice and have proven to be very\nsuccessful, but their insistence on only\nusing the medics for these purposes\nhave put them at a disadvantage. In\nthe Union we have permanent staff\nwho can help everyone with their\nsports fixtures, the running of events\nand everything you need to know\nabout financial difficulties that you\nmight face. The sabbaticals are also\nhere to work for you, being the most\nable to advise you on the Union policy and regulations that you will have\nto follow. If you need help or are\nunsure please come and see us, we\nare more than willing to help, after all\nwe work for you.\nThere have been some replies\nabout the opening times of the Health\nCentre, not enough though.

    "content": "ft\nLetters 30 November 1998\nResignation Explanation\nMany medical students over the last few\ndays, especially those I saw at the wonderful Winter Ball, asked me my reasons\nfor resigning my post on ICSMSU last\nweek. The decision was not one taken\nlightly but after several agonising days of\ncontemplation.\nI was upset by the way Seif Ahmed\n(ex-VPI CX) was treated by certain members of the union executive, who continually undermined his position,\nsometimes to people as high up as Professor Whitehouse, and threatening such\nnonsense s as votes of no confidence.\nThis in someone the electorate convincingly voted in less than five months ear-lier. Seif should have been urged to stay,\nand I believe would have done had he\nfelt support coming from the President.\nAndy Heeps was potentially the most\nuseful person on the union, knowing\nthe IC red tape system better than anyone else, and being well respected by\nmany at IC. His decision to leave was\nprobably more due to personal differences with some members of the SU\nthan anything to do with leaving a failing\nunion as was quoted in last weeks Felix.\nHowever, I didn't resign just to follow\nsuit. I was extremely angered by the loss\nof \u00a33000 from the medical school reserve\nfunds, due to a botched attempt at a Graduation Ball. Members of the SU from\nMary's were not even aware this was\ngoing to occur until less than a week\nbefore Graduation Day. That money was\nso precious in a year when there is talk\nof charging clubs more money for\nminibuses, and although ICU authorised\nthe deposit being put down, it is not I.C students who have lost the money but\nmedical clubs and societies.\nWorking on the executive this year\nwas many more times harder than last\nyear, due a lot to poor communication.\nI missed important meetings on more\nthan one occasion when I was given\nless than two hours notice that I should\nattend. As a non-sabbatical doing the\nnew clinical course, which is heavily\ntimetabled, I needed a lot of notification\nfor meetings. This left me looking incompetent, especially when our sabbatical\nPresident made the same meetings.\nI have been criticised by various\nmembers of the union since my re sig nation, saying I have 'given in'. Maybe\nthis is the case, but the atmosphere surrounding the SU was one which left no\nway to discuss problems with those who\nmatter. I know that the departure of the\nother two and myself has also angered\nsome students and I hope you ask why\nthings have been allowed to get this\nbad. It has certainly upset me, but there\ncomes a time when I can no longer carry\nout the job that you expect of me due to\nthe circumstances I find myself working\nin. I will continue to support the SU,\nespecially the VPI at St. Mary's, who is\ndoing an extremely good job.\nFinally, it may be reported that we\nhave a failing union, that in some way\nthe medics are weakened, certain columnists in this newspaper may claim we are\nin disarray. Don't believe a word of it - the\nunion is not as strong as the executive\nwho run it, but the other way around, the\nexecutive is as strong as the student\nbody it represents and serves. None of\nmy actions or this letter will in any way\nweaken our medical school. In the four\nmonths of it's existence it has already\nshown itself to be far stronger than any individual, and I continue to be proud to\nbe a member of it,\nYours sincerely,\nOliver Warren.\nCorrection\nDear Felix,\nI'd like to make a correction to the article \"Marching for More Money\" (Felix\n1127). The very first sentence labels the\nnational demonstration for grants not\nloans last Wednesday as \"A Socialist\nWorker demonstration\". Though the SWP,\nas is their right, did take a leading role in\nadvertising the demo, the demonstration\nwas called by \"Unite for Free Education\",\nan umbrella group encompassing the\nCampaign for free Education, the Stop\nthe Fees Campaign, and Save Free Education. It also had the support of Student\nUnions Against the Act and 40 individual\nstudent unions around the country.\nPerhaps this is all lost on some pe o ple, but the number of people I 've heard\nwho stated that they weren't going /\ndidn't go because \"it's a Socialist Worker\ndemonstration\" I think justifies this\nresponse. Still I'd like to congratulate this\nyears Felix team, especially Ed Sexton, in\ntaking an interest in the student move-ment. There is a world outside Imperial!\nGeorge Constantinidcs\nUnix one, Microsoft nil\nDear Felix,\nRecently Bill Gates received his second\ncream pie in the face from the ever insurgent Biotic Baking Brigade. But it seems\nthough that we're not united in our disgust of Microsoft's practices and prod-uc ts. This year the Physics department\n'upgraded' by getting rid of its Unix run terminals in the undergraduate computer\nroom and replacing them with windows\nNT. At the same time they actually expect\nstudents to meet deadlines, even though\nthey may have all their work erased in the\nmeantime, have to wait up to five minutes\nto open an application and sit on the\nedge of their chairs hoping that it won't crash. Furthermore, Microsoft's assets are\nmore than four times the amount of\nmoney needed to pay off the entire 3rd world debt owed to the United States,\nwhich currently ensures that the markets\nof these countries arc about as free' as\nAlcatraz and controlled entirely by the\nMicrosoft oriented IMI, WTO and World\nBank. Do us at! a favour Physics and give\nus our COMPUTERS back.\nYours etc\nThomas N.D. Tibbits\nSummer Ball Update\nDear Felix,\nFhe Imperial College Summer Ball currently being planned for next summer is\ngoing to be a huge and spectacular event.\nHowever every contribution can help to\nmake it even better than planned. If you\nhave any input and ideas for the event\nthen let us know. We want to hear from\nEVERYONE including those of you who\nwent last year, or from anyone who has\nbeen to similar totally wicked events else-where.\nPlease note that the e mail address\npublished in the last edition of felix is\nWRONG. Please send all ideas to the\nCommittee at summer.bail@ic.ac.uk\nSee you all in June,\nThe Summer Ball Committee\nEast Meets West?\nDear Felix\nIt seems as though Karan Kapoor, Social\nChair of Charing Cross, has again put his\nfoot in it! East meets West is a cultural\nshow that has been run jointly by the\nIndian Society and Charing Cross for a number of years. This year, the show\nwas organised by Mr Kapoor and the\nIndian Society President, Roopa Arora.\nAdvertisement for the show had long\nbeen organised and distributed throughout the University of London. However,\nearlier this [i.e. last - Ed I week, alternative\nflyers were found in the BMS building\nstating the show was \"run by medics\".\nWith reference to KK's letter in issue\n1126, the notion that all students are\nequal seems to be false. Given that KK\nco-organised the show, the appearance\nof these flyers in the BMS (and not else-where) seems to suggest that his commitment to integration is non-existent. As\nan apparently \"respected\" member of\nthe CX medical school, KK should realise\nthat telling these lies generates integration problems that the college as a whole\nIs trying to eradicate.\nTaking credit for weeks of hard work\ndone by non-medic members of the\nIndian Society is not clever. On a personal note, I feel that not distributing\nthese flyers across the University is a little spineless. Perhaps others should ponder the notion that the animosity\nbetween CX medics and IC is something\nthat is actively being generated from the\nupper reaches of the CX student com-mitte e. Taj,\nVP Indian Society\nDesperation for RCSU\nDear Sir,\nIt would appear that the plight of the\nRCSU has been ignored by the majority\nof its members. Flow many of the 2500\nor so students actually know that on\nMonday and Tuesday last week, the\nRCSU Presidency elections were held?\nNot many, if you judge from the results.\nFirstly, there was only one candidate,\nSimon Tom. Has anyone ever met him?\nFor myself, I can say that the only publicity I ever saw was a \"vote for Tim\"\nposter in the Sherfield Building. Does\nanyone ever believe that a president\nthat has a half-committed attitude to\npublicity for the election, is ever going to\nbe committed his job? Secondly, the vo t ing, which took place last week, was\nattended by approximately 4% of the\nelectorate. Can I suggest that the RCSU\nneeds to get its act together?\nThe RCSU is getting desperate. They\nneed help fast, and I might suggest that\nif it doesn't get it, it might as well just give\nup, because it probably won't make\nmuch difference for those it is supposed\nto be working for. But, it has to ask. I am\nsure that if it asked now and tried advertising the benefits of working for the\nRCSU, then it would get it, but, of course,\nit takes publicity.\nI hope that the RCSU gets help soon,\nbecause there is so much that can be\ndone, but they just don't have the\nresources, so if anyone has ever felt that\nthey would like to help, the they will\nwelcome you in with open arms, and you\nmight even get a biscuit.\nWhat's the Fuss About?\nDear Felix,\nIt appears that Mr Osa Fmohare has\ncaused quite a stir amongst Felix readers.\nI find it rather surprising that his famous\nletter had any responses, considering its\nlength!

The league was within our grasp,\nwith only the bottom team to beat. We\nwanted their girth and we were determined to get it.\nOur kit was gleaming white and as\nsoft as a baby's behind, having been\nwashed with Persil and softened with\nLenor.\nThings got started badly with Budbud-bud-buddha dropping the ball a lot.\nHe finally redeemed himself by scoring\n2 tries so scorching hot that we all\nneeded lots of Walls Ice Cream to cool\ndown afterwards.\nDave offered in some Poppadums at\nhalftime, with our piping hot cups of PG\ntips. The second half allowed us to add\n3 more tries to our total. The scores, Tref,\nWillis and the arc-angel Gabriel all celebrated with lashing s of Coleman's mustard after the game. In all a good\nperformance, although we will have to\ndo a lot better in our promotion play-off\nmatch next week.\nAfter the game wc all put on our\nLynx de oder ant and CK aftershave, to celebrate winning the game and thc\nleague. But Dan and Tref covered themselves with Flora and went fot a kebab.\nIC played 6, won 6. Points difference:\n+259. [\n1 may have to consider charging\nfor advertising space if I get any more\narticles like this - Gus].\n2nd XV\nIC II 46 - 5 St George's( Last week's score 75 - 7 V UCH)\nWe have travelled over mist covered\nmountains from our homeland IC. But\nour true home is Harlington and always\nwill be. Someday we will return to Southside's loving arms and no longer burn to\nbe brothers in arms.\nFields of destruction and baptisms\nof fire, all witness their suffering as the\npoints score soared higher, but we did\nnot desert our brothers in arms. So\nmany different teams and so many inefficient scores. Now we strive harder to\nconquer other shores. Now the sun\ngone to hell and the beer is flowing fine.\nLet me bid you farewell, every man has\nto die. Cry havoc and let slip the dogs\nof war!!\nRSM Football\nRSM I01 LSE I RSM 1 st XI took a crucial step in the Premier league after what can only be\ndescribed as a nightmare start to the sea-son.\nThe chips were once again down as\nthey entertained LSE firsts - who were the\nonly team that had beaten last year's champions and last week's tormentors\nQMW. Any pre-match nerves were\nquashed, courtesy of Tara and her amazing bris tio l's, which put real purpose and\nhope into the heart's of a team with a mountain to climb, although no explanation was given as to why Skip Masefield threw up four times. With Jim York's late arrival after helping out his mum\n(such a nice lad), the RSM massive was\nprimed and ready.\nWith a strong wind behind them,\nLSE turned on the pressure early in the\nmatch, with a string of corners, which\nwere virtually impossible to keeper Mark\nDwyer to deal with. Yet time after time,\nthe ball was bundled away and increasingly RSM started to play.\nAfter about half an hour, RSM had\nwhat proved to be their two best\nchances of the match. The first was a free kick on the edge of the box which\nWelsh wizard John Williams skillfully bent\naround the wall only for it to be palmed\naround by a flying f SE keeper. A few\nminutes late t and a flowing move that\nlinked all areas of the offense together,\nlike a string of shiny pearls, culminating\nin debut ante Doug Spikes firing a shot\npast the upright, a chance which RSM\ncould ill afford to miss.\nSure enough they were made to\npay as an onslaught from LSE early in the\nsecond half proved too much to handle\nand eventually the RSM resistance was\nbroken. A shot from outside the area,\nwhich keeper Dwyer got his hand to,\ncrept into the goal.\nThe rest of the match was played out\nin a low key manner, although RSM did\nthreaten towards the end, but the\naccountants had their pencil's sharpened and as usual weren't giving anything away.\nSo two games, two defeats. A far\nfrom perfect start, but with next week's cup match, thc confidence should be\nraised. A far more professional performance from the team, although thc day\nsurely belonged to Tara.\nTiddlywinks\nWORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS\nAndy Purvis (IC) 31 - Larry Kahn (USA) 19\nImperial College's most successful but\nleast known 'sport' was taking place last\nThursday at the out of town Silwood\nPark campus. Previous victories over\nOxford University have established IC as\nthe.country's second tid d ly winking Institution coincidentally with its rise to that\nposition in thc national University league\ntables.\nThe tiddlywinks club, which meets every\nMonday, also boasts that rare commodity among IC societies - the World Champion. Dr. Andy Purvis, of the Department\nof Biology, has recently struck a rich vein\nof tid d ly wink form, winning the world\nchampionship earlier this year and subsequently achieving.something of a grand slam of the national doubles and\nsingles tournaments. Larry Kahn, how-ever, had won this most coveted winks\ntrophy no less than 18 times over the\nyears, so when the American laid down\nhis challenge the stage was set for a mouthwatering showdown.\nThis was thc 49th ever world championship match, and an appropriate number of spectators gathered to watch as\nthe two gladiators stalked into the arena:\nas is well established, the winner in these\nmeetings is thc first to 24.5 points, effectively making it a best out of 7 games\ncompetition.\nBoth contenders were affected by the\nbig-game atmosphere at first - after thc\nfirst four games which featured one or\ntwo shaky errors, as well as a clear-up of\nrare quality from the local boy, the score\nwas level at 14 all. At this crucial psychological moment, Purvis played his\nhome advantage card and suggested a dinner-break in the pub. A risky strategy,\nbut one which paid off - after dropping\na point in the first game back, the English champion then potted aggressively\nin the last two games to romp gleefully\nhome with a clear margin of 12 points.\nFootball\nICV3 - 1 S.O.P After a string of disappointing results\nthe fifths were determined to get a result\nout of this game. We played poorly but\nthey were worse than us and after a constant barrage on their goal the breakthrough came when Will \"still pissed\nfrom last night\" Doubar danced through\nthe penalty area and was hacked to the\nfloor by one of their donkeys. Team captain Andy Chlua calmly walked up and\nshot a crap penalty to the right of the\nkeeper and in off the post. They\ndefended on the halfway line and after\nhaving twenty-odd offside decision given\nagainst us (thanks Warren), the pressure\npaid off after some nice movement in\nmidfield produced a pass to Adi who\nblasted it into the top right hand corner.\nThey scored a crap equalise r( 'nuff said)\nand then on the break Tom Walker produced a peach of a cross to Andy who\nslotted it first time into the corner. It did-n't feel like a win, but forget about the\nperformance - we need the points!\nIC Virgins\nIC 10 - 0 Royal Holloway\nOn a cold grey day in November, the virgins notched up another fantastic vic-tory, fries were scored by Betsy and little\nClare, with conversions only narrowly\nmissed by Ronny, despite being right on\nthe touch line. We were a player short\nyet again, despite \"recruiting\" Sabine,\nCari-ann, Leanne and Betsy.\nThe forwards dominated play, with\nMichelle, Lisa and Kiersten surviving in\nthc front row despite the collapsing\nscrum s( due to the inability of their no.\n8 to walk backwards). Thc tackling was\nimmense with Clare dumping their wing\nevery time and Kiersten making them\nsqueal. We pushed them back in the\nscrum every time, usually gaining at\nleast 20m. We've discovered Big Clare's left hook, Summma's novel tackling and\nChris and Chrissy's power in the scrum.\nWc spent most of the time camped in\ntheir half and on the very few occasions\nthey squeezed into ours, Romy's kicking\nsent them scurrying back lo their try\nline.\nArchery\nL 'Muppet makes her mark\nSunday thc 22nd saw the spanking new\nteam from ICRPC, the archery team,\nenter the BUSA Southern Area Championships held at Brunei University. The\nArchery Captain, Leo 'The Muppet' Lang\ngot the day off to a good start by getting\nthe team lost. Fortunately wiser minds\n(Phil Golds Ihe RPC captain) were at\nhand and steered the team in the tight\ndirection. We arrived fashionably late\nand were fortunate to get into the next\nsession. The team kicked off well, slapping their arrows into thc gold time\nafter time. I he other competitors could\nonly stand and admire the evident skill\nof our to xo phi lists. At the end of a great\nperformance our archers had all gained\nrespectable positions on the scoreboard,\nwith Leo coming third (it'll be first next\ntime) in the Ladies competition and Seb\nTsakok achieving a personal best. We left\nin jubilant mood and went to celebrate\nwith a scorching curry and painted\nUxbridge a nice shade of yellow with\ncarrot y bil s. "

    "content": "30 November 1998 Arts Feature 19\nTHE LONDON FILM FESTIVAL '98\nEscape from Hollywood blockbusters and embrace the world of alternative cinema. Dynamic duo\nBen & Dave present a brief cross-section of this years contributions.\nImagine fifteen days of diverse, international cinema, assorted from the\nworks of some of the most exciting,\ninnovative directors and filmmakers\naround. A selection including blockbusters shown before their nationwide\nrelease, as well as films lower in profile,\nbut very often higher in quality. A chance\nto rub shoulders and pick the brains of\nfamous directors, producers or actors\nand to really absorb the culture of film-making. This is the London Film Festival.\nSound good? Well, the bad news is that\nyou've just missed it!\nCorps Plonges\nI his was the second feature by the\napparently acclaimed director Raoul Peck,\nbut almost from the start it was a disappointment. The story centered around a female pathologist's involvement with\ntwo men and her struggle against a suspiciously Gallic New York City. The film\nlacked any of the style one has come to\nexpect of french cinema and had clumsy\ndirection and melodramatic acting. It's a surprise that Corps Plonges made it to\nthe London Film Festival and shows that\nnot every film they screen is first rate.\nDin Raoul Peck / Haiti-French 1997\nThe Interview (pictured left)\nThis thoroughly professional debut\nfeature by Austtalian writer/director Craig\nMonahan was totally funded by Australian television. The storyline, both purposeful and unpredictable, was\ndeveloped by Monahan over a seven-year period. It's set in a police interview\nroom and revolves around the guilt of\nthe main character, played by excitable\nHugo Weaving.\nThe strong plot was further boosted\nby the use of high-contrast lighting tech-ni ques, some excellent cinematography\n(orchestrated by the obviously talented\nSimon Duggan) and sound production\nwhich added depth and realism. These\nfactors combined to give the film intensity, at the same time echoing the feelings of desperation, fear and hate.\nHowever, the characters were (per-hap s intentionally) rather two-dimensional. The plot is also somewhat\ncontrived and ambiguous. In retrospect,\nthis films borrows much from Brian\nSinger's superior Usual Suspects but is\nsufficiently different to make it worthwhile viewing for the discerning cinema\ngoer.\nDir: Craig Monahan / Australia 1998\nBrown's Requiem\nThis film follows closely on the footsteps of LA Confidential, as the second\nfilm in so many years to be adapted\nfrom a James Ellroy novel. However any\ncomparisons between these films is\nunfair, as Brown's Requiem is a low budget movie - a debut feature from the\nyoung US writer/director Jason Freeland,\nand is 'indie' in the truest sense.\nI his film was wholly\nfinanced through private\nfunds with no affiliation to\nany studio. These budget\nrestrictions meant the story\nhad to be doctored some-what. The picture was set\n17 years later than the\nnovel and a rare period of\nrainy weather in LA (due to\nEl Nino) had to be written\ninto the script. Otherwise,\nthe storyline attempted to\nremain as faithful as possible to the original book,\nand revolved around the investigations\nof Fritz Brown, a PI played by Michael\nRooker. His unconvincing performance\ndid nothing to aid his remarkable resemblance to Joe Cocker in letting the audience take him seriously.\nThe film is well shot, intelligently\ndirected, and benefited from a strong\nsupporting cast. However the plodding,\nclich e ridden storyline had little tension\nor surprise in it. The next death or discovery is ali too easy to predict, especially\nif you are well versed in this genre.\nDir: Jason Freeland / USA 1998\nBritish Programme Shorts\nThis was an eclectic and on the\nwhole entertaining slice of contemporary\nBritish cinema. Possibly the standout\nshort was The Anniversary, which was a moving and sensitive portrayal of grief\nand old age. It was written by and starred\nthe veteran British actor Jim Broadbent,\nwho played an emotionally repressed,\nmiddle-aged businessman struggling to\ncome to terms with the loss of his wife\nand mother in a car accident, and his\nfather to the deterioration of old age.\nDir: various\nThe Buttoners (KoflikaYi) (pictured right)\nThis was the British debut of Petr\nZelenka's Czech film and part of the\nLFF's 'Experimenta' section. The funding\nfor the film was provided by Czech TV to\nits credit, demonstrating that the Czech\nRepublic is willing to leave mainstream\ncinema and test the murky waters of\nexperimental film (although it failed to\nventure far into the deep blue). The film\nis broken up into a series of separate,\nseemingly distinct stories, in random\norder and then in true Tarantino-esque\nstyle the progression of the film allows\nthe links between sub-plots to be\nrevealed. The tone of the film is lighthearted throughout with sharp dialogue,\nbizarre situations and ways of life - the\nstrangest undoubtedly belonging to the\neponymous Buttoners, or in Czech, the\nKoflikaYi. In spite of the acting quality\nand plot originality, the film overstayed\nits welcome This observation contrasts with perhaps\nthe greatest flaw of the film\n- the seemingly hurried\nending, which grated\npainfully with the rest of\nthe storylines, being unrealistic and devoid of creativity. That aside though,\nthis was not a bad film. If\nyou are inclined to see it, it\nis touring London for the\nnext month and a half and\nwill also be represented\nduring the Czech Season at\nRiverside.\nDir: Petr Zelenka / Czech Republic 1997\nAshes from Paradise (Cenizas del Paraiso)\nA powerful tale of corruption and\nmurder from Argentinean cinema, Ashes\nfrom Paradise is an absorbing film.\nStrong, well-developed characters and\ngood acting maintain your interest during the two hours. The director also provides the audience with some stunningly\nemotive scenes and compelling use of\nlight, as well as high quality cinematography. The plot centres around the murder of a girl - whose corpse is shown in\ngruesome and graphic detail at the\nbeginning of the film - and a judge's search for her killer. Three brothers all\nconfess to the murder, all apparently\nwithout motives and it's from this entangled beginning that the plot slowly\nbegins to unwind in extended flashbacks.\nAdditionally, the big players subplot of corrupt judges and businessmen hampering the\ninvestigation further adds to the\nconfusion. In fact, such is the complexity and speed of the storyline\nthat at first it's difficult to keep\ntrack of the action, but perseverance certainly pays off. The\ndenouement was slightly disappointing for those expecting great\nrevelations after such an excellent\nand painstaking build-up, but to some\ntastes no doubt satisfying, and by no\nmeans poor.\nDir: Marcelo Piheyro / Argentina 1997\nTwo Girls and a Guy\nOne of the weaker contributions,\nthis film lacked convincing acting with\nwooden deliveries and unrealistic reactions, there is the occasional moment of\ncomedy provided by Blake (Robert\nDowncyjr), the 'guy' in the title, and his\naimless ramblings, but the overriding\nresponse is simply a cringing embarrassment. Dir: James Toback/ USA 1997\nYour Friends and Neighbours\nThe second coming of US indie\ndirector Neil Labute of In the Company\nof Men fame. If you missed his excellent\ndebut, and most did, then you may be\nslightly shocked by this picture. But in the\nlight of In the Company of Men, controversial it is not, so the hardcore fans may\nbe disappointed. There are still relationships without the glamour, male bigots\nand backstabbing, but Labute's formula\nhas been diluted. In this film, the director focuses in on sexual relationships\nand highlights the massive differences\nbetween the genders when it comes to\nsexual mores. However, it lacks the tight,\nwell-rounded and ultimately shocking\nplot of his debut. There are some classic\nscenes nonetheless with genuine\nhumour. Since In the Company of Men\nhad its most successful running in the\nworld in London, it is fairly likely that\nYour friends and NeighboursvAW be well\nrepresented in the capital's cinemas.\nDir: Neil Labutc/ USA 1998\nThe 42nd LFF ran between 5-19th November with literally hundreds of films\nbeing shown at five main venues - primarily at Odeon West End (Leicester\nSquare) and at the National Film Theatre\n(South Bank Centre), which also screens\nclassic and art-house cinema throughout\nthe year. Further information, including\ndetails of the next LFF in November 1999\nshould be available from the official web-site: www.fl lmu nll mi ted. co.uk. Apparently, this site \"is the indispensable guide\n\n"

    "content": "24\nGames 30 November 1998\nTOCA 2 (PSX)\nCodemasters\nFormula 1 has its F1 '98, so Touring Cars\nhas its TOCA range. Codemasters,\npleased as punch at having smashed all\nthe opposition in the rally car racing\ngame with Colin McRae Rally, has\ndecided to dig in and produce a better\nTouring Car racing game.\nIf you did want an excellent British\nTouring Car game then go and buy it\nnow. But if it is such an excellent game\nthen you might well wonder \"Why only\n4 stars?\". OK so the game is good, damn\ngood with excellent high-resolution\ngraphics - you can now see into other\ncars should you wish to take your eyes\noff the road. The action is fluid and the\nnow expected pop up handled well.\nCars can be driven positively if a little bit\ntoo sensitively from the dual shock compatible control method - the first ten or\nso laps will be spent attempting to\nfollow the racing line rather than fish\ntail down the long fast corners.\nThere is even realistic collision damage when the car takes the tight\nright hand bend too fast, ending up\nagainst the fence without a front\nbumper, tv en more scary is when\nsome adrenaline fuelled boy racer\nshunts and destroys half of the rear\nof your car just because you\ndecided to brake for the same tight right\ncorner on the next lap. If your car comes\nin less damaged than old Nige's Fords\nthen consider it a good race. In fact if you\nlove British Touring Car you might even\nlove Top Gear's Tiff whining sarcastically.\nThis game would have definitely got 5\nstars if a game with a very small name\ndid not already exist. Want to know\nwhich is still the best saloon car racing\ngame? it's still GT.\nIf you have not got it by now you\nreally should just go and buy GT (Gran\nTourismo) and try hard not to get\naddicted to the breadth of racing pos-sibi li ties. So what if you cant turn a car\nover and 300 kph collisions result in\nnothing happening to the car - except\nperhaps making the car face another\ndirection. You don't just have a fixed\nnumber of works prepared race cars,\nyou have the whole of the manufacturers production range. TOCA does what\nit says, and does it very well. Unfortunately the saloon car racer has moved\non. Now if only you could start by racing\nmini cars round Silverstone and then\nmove up to thc touring cars using the\nsame graphics and game play as TOCA\nor better, well then you might just be\nonto a six out of five.\nGary S. Apocalypse (PSX)\nActivision\nMovie tie-ins, TV tie-ins, with te go there\nis now even a toy brick tie in, but an actor\ntie-in - now that is an original concept.\nActivision realising that a third person\nshooter needs a bit of an edge, has\ndecided that by using Bruce Willis as the\nhero in this game they have the sharpest\ngame in thc box. The digitised Bruce\nplays Trey Kincaide, humanity's only\nhope in a world where science is outlawed and Imperial knocked down and\nturned into the Diana garden of Peace\nand Virtue. Kincaide's tutor has decided\non one last experiment and has summoned the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in an attempt to inc tease his next\ngrant application. So Btuce, sorry Kincaide, has to hunt them\ndown one by one,\nthough starting from a prison cell is not the best\nway to go about it.\nThe Btuce influence\nruns deep, with big\nweapons, big linear levels and big Bruce voice\novers when you waste a bad guy or stumble\nacross another part of\nthc story. Thc game does\nfeel like a movie more\nthan a game, thc main character seems\nto be able to survive almost anything and\nthe first two end of level guardians can\nbe despatched easily and quickly just by\nsimple dodge left then\nright moves.\nThe game itself is\ngood while never\nreaching excellent, the\nswitching camera\nangles are both orig i nal, and unnecessarily\nannoying for the\nbeginner. Its not all\nannoying touches,\nthere are some blasts\nfrom the past s, the character can fire\nin directions other than the one you are\nrunning in. The graphics are moody and\noffer up the occasional surprise, such as\nthe background screens playing thc\nvideo of one of the sound tracks as you\nfight your way round the city. The sounds\nare loud, and with Bruce quipping every\nother minute - very action movie. In fact\nproject it onto a cinema screen and call\nit Die Hard 45 - die good but not dead\ngood.\nGary S. No One Can Stop Mr Domino (PSX) Full Time\nEvery once in a while an odd and original game makes it to the levels of game\nnirvana. It immediately bonds with the\ngame-players psyche and sits there looking very smugly down on all of the driving and combat clones. Wotms and\nLemmings are examples of this strange\noccurrence, Domino on the other hand\nis just too odd.\nCombine the silly circuit elements of\nmicro mach in cs, remove any racing components and instead allow levels to be\nfinished when Mr Domino completes all\nof the domino tricks on a level; mix in\nsome very odd Japanese ideas and you\nhave Mr Domino described totally. Or\nperhaps it is not all that simple.\nThe game ends when you lose all\nyour lives, which happens when you\nc it her run out of time, or thc domino\ncharacter has been smacked, bumped or\nfallen its way to an early return to the big\ndomino box in the sky. The tricks arc\ncompleted by laying dominos and then\nmaking them fall onto a trick tile on the\nfloor, so to complete a level requires at\nleast two circuits of some very odd tracks.\nPutting aside the severe oddness of\nthe game - only achievable under altered\nstates of mind, the game is mildly amusing if difficult to complete. Thete is a certain addiction clement as you attempt to\nsee what thc next trick will achieve. The\nfirst few ate obvious - pool balls falling\ninto pockets and ball bearings spiralling\ndown tracks - but after a while the oddness truly takes hold as cereal packets\nsuddenly go all Munch and start to\nbecome animated \"scream\" images and\nrice starts popping from an overhead\nrice popper. Hmmm. There are also\nsome nice odd touches such as when\nthe domino char act et picks up a carrier\nbag and uses it as a parachute.\nIn summary, this is odd, very odd.\nEither it is being marketed for young\nkids, where watching large asexual,\nbright coloured, creatures with TV's where there internal organs should exist\nis considered normal. Or it's for thc late\nnight pub and club, chill out crowd. Its\ndefinitely not for adults in thc cold light\nof day.\nGary 5.\nResults\nLiterally tens of feverish fans entered the\nMichael Owen's World League Soccer\n'99 competition for the Playstation. The\nanswers to the questions wet c obviously.1. Michael Owen's squad number In\nthe Liverpool squad was 10.\n2.

    "content": "News 30 November 1998\nRCSU Torn by Light runs out of\nPoor Turnout Steam\nBy Gareth Morgan By Andrew Ofori\nAfter two months of uncertainty, the\nRoyall College of Science Union has\nbelatedly elected Simon Torn as their\nPresident. The result was announced\nlast Tuesday night in the Union Bar,\nafter an election which, despite the\nefforts of the Union, remained stubbornly low-profile.\nMr Torn, a second year Physicist,\nwho was defeated in last year's election for RCSU VP and ICU Council\nChair, was the only candidate, and\nstood against the ever-present New\nElection. The Hustings, held on Eriday\n20 November in the JCR, were\nattended by only two students other\nthan those directly involved in the\nelection: a Departmental Rep and a Felix report et, both members of the\nRCSU's General Committee. This was in\nspite of an excess of one hundred\nposters put up around the College in\nthe week leading up to the Hustings.\nIn the two days of voting, only 100\nvotes were cast - about 4% of the electorate Mr Torn received seventy votes\nand was duly elected. Thc RCSU Vice\nPresident (finance) Will Bently pointed\nout, however, that this was a better\npercentage than the estimated turnout\nfor the aborted IC Union Deputy President (Clubs & Societies) election,\nwhere approximately 100-500 votes\nwere cast from an electorate of over\nnine thousand.\nthe Union celebrated in the traditional manner, giving away free beer\nto the few who turned up to hear the\nresults, fot a College which supposedly has the highest alcohol consumption per capita of any students\nunion in thc country, Imperial's societies find it surprisingly hard to give\naway free beer. The promise of a drink\nfor anyone who voted did not appear\nto have greatly affected the overall\nturnout.\nMr Torn was pleased with his vic-tory, saying that he was \"delighted to\nbe given this opportunity\" and pledging to \"ensure that the Union does\nsomething for its students.\"\nThe speed of light is slowing down,\naccording to a new the o ty to be published soon. If space observations prove\nit to be correct, much of this century's work in the ote tica! physics, including\nmany of Einstein's famous theories, will\nneed to be adjusted.\nThe textbook-rewriting theory, proposed by jo ao Magneijo (Royal research\nfellow at Imperial College) and Andreas\nAlbrecht (formerly of IC but now of the\nUniversity of California at Davis), says\nthat the speed of light immediately after\nthe big bang was much faster than\ntoday's accepted value, and has been\nslowing down ever since.\nBy daring to challenge one of thc\nmost basic assumptions of theoretical\nphysics the theory is bound to come\nunder close scrutiny from scientists\nacross the globe, focusing thc spotlight\non Imperial once again. Dr Magneijo\ncommented \"If it's true, it would be a very big leap forward that will affect our\nperception of the universe and much of\ntheoretical physics.\"\nAssuming the big bang model to\nbe true, moments after the big bang,\nlight could only cross from one side of\nthe universe to the other if it moved\nmuch quicker than the previously\nassumed constant velocity. This new\nhypothesis suggests that this could be as\nmuch as the current value (3 x108m/ s) multiplied by a70 figure number!\nThe theory offers elegant proofs for\nmany phenomena which previous theories have failed lo satisfactorily ratio-na lise. It supplies the best explanation\nyet for the speed at which the universe\nis expanding, which is thought to be\nfast enough to prevent collapse, resulting in a 'big crunch' in this case, the ultimate fate of the uni vets c would be a slow, drawn-out death as all the stars\nburn out and every particle of matter\nwithin the universe separates.\nThe new theory rivals the currently\naccepted model of inflation to describe\nwhat happened immediately after thc\nbig bang. It will be published in full in the\nscientific journal Physical Review D. STEC Presents\nClub 414, 10th December\n414 Colcftarbomr Itmxmf B.r ix to: \u00bb\nTECHNO TRANCE ACID TECHNO\n\n"

    "content": "30\nNovember\n1998\nKEEP THE CAT FREE EST 1949\nThe Students' Newspaper at Imperial College Wade in Resignation Nightmare\nIC School of Medicine Union has suffered\nits third key resignation in a little over a month, with the departure of Education\nRep Oliver Warren. This has brought to\nthe surface deep divisions within the\nUnion Executive, and has raised questions from several quarters over the competency of the Med School President, Mr\nWade Gayed.\nMr Warren's reasons for resignation,\ngiven both in a letter to Felix and in per-son, would seem to be twofold, firstly, he\nhad been \"extremely angered by thc\nloss of \u00a33000 from the medical school\nreserve funds\" which resulted from thc\ncancelled Graduation Ball. Again, thc finger of blame is pointed, with Mr Warren\nadding, \"members of the SU from Mary's were not even aware this was going to\noccur until less than a week before Graduation Day\". This loss was, in Mr Warren's words, \"So precious in a year when there\nis talk of charging clubs more money for\nminibuses...\" Indeed it comes on top of\nBy David Roberts\nf \u2022\u2022/m ii<ii*\\ '\nPhoto: Andy Wade stands alone as Exec members fall\na series of other exceptional payments\nand purchases which have seen the\nICSMSU reserves dwindle from in excess\nof \u00a355000 to practically nothing.\nSecondly, he expresses a clear lack\nof confidence in the Medical School President, who \"manages to avoid the flak by\ncovering himself and passing thc buck\",\nformer ICU President Andy Hceps, who\nhimself resigned as Med School Secretary\nlast month, confirmed this point of view,-\"There is a very unhappy atmosphere\namongst School of Medicine students at\nthe moment because there is no clear\nleadership...I am not surprised that there\nare more resignations coming through.\"\nAlthough Mr Gayed refused to comment d it cc t ly on Mr Warren's resignation,\nbeyond remarking that it was \"very unfortunate\", he accepted that \"we're constantly discovering problems ...they can't all be sot ted out this year - we're like a crash team, sent in to locate all the problems and meet them head on\". However,\nhe did add that \"things are getting bet-ter\".\nSeveral sources have suggested that\na senior member of staff advised Mr\nWarren to resign his position. Further\ninvestigation, however, suggests that\nstaff have had a strong role to play in the\nother resignations, and indeed the entire\nrunning of ICSMSU. One senior source\nput this very bluntly; \"Gayed is being\nContinued on page 2\nDesigner Drugs A Menace\nBy Andrew Brown\nThe streets, pubs and clubs of Britain\nhave been hit with new, lethal, designer\ndrugs. Already responsible for three\ndeaths in thc UK, as well as two in Holland, not all of these drugs are classified\nas ill c gal. Thousands are being sold as\necstasy, the users unaware that the new\ndrugs can be up to 33 times stronger.\n4-MTA (4-methyl th io amphetamine), more commonly known as 'Il at liners' due to the 'out of body' experience that\nthey allegedly cause, has been named as\nbeing responsible for at least two deaths.\nPrivate Stephen Evans of the Devonshire\nand Dorset Regiment died after taking a cocktail of drugs during a night out in\nTorquay. He returned to his girlfriend's flat in Plymouth where he turned purple\nand lapsed into a coma - the paramedics\narrived too i ate. Thc coroner found opi-at es, cocaine, methadone, cannabis, two\ntypes of ecstasy and 4-MTA (Flatliners) in\nPrivate Evans' body. He recorded a verdict of death by non-dependant abusive\ndrugs and remarked \"Anyone who takes\ndrugs like this is playing Russian Roulette\nwith their lives.\" Hatliners were also\nresponsible for the death of a22 year-old\npsychology student in Shepton Mallet,\nSomerset, in July. She had not taken any\nother drugs.\nPhoto: Joel The pills appear Innocent\n4-MTA was developed at Purdue University, Indiana by Professor David\nNicholls as a replacement for thc antidepressant Prozac or as an appetite sup-press ant. It was never tested on humans,\nbut underground chemists found references to it in scientific papers and reproduced it. However, Professor Nicholls\ncommented that it was only intended to\nbe prescribed in 2-3mg doses, not the\ndoses in excess of lOOm g the cream-coloured tablets contain.\nPossession of flatliners is not illegal\nas they are only covered by the Medicines Act, which is rarely enforced. The\nHome Office is considering classifying\nthese and 35 other ecstasy derivatives as\nclass A drugs under the Misuse of Drugs\nlegislation with penalties of 7 years and\nan unlimited fine for possession, 14 years\nplus a fine for unlawful production and\nlife imprisonment for supplying.\nThc other drug, 4-bro mo2,5di mc th oxy amphetamine( DOB), sold as\nGolden Eagle, has its roots in thc sixties\nand has sometimes been sold as LSD.\nThere have been ten seizures by British\npolice recently.

    "content": "16 Music 30 November 1998\nc<c<d iF< e Artist Profile - Hardfloor\nHardfloor have made a name for them selves as one of the outfits that took add\nmusic and really evolved and experimented with it. As their music became\nmore famous and filled up dancefloor s the world over, so too did the demands\nfor the remixing skills. They have even\nmoved into the field of remixing big\nnames such as Depechc Mode, New\nOrder and Mori kant e. Hardfloor are\nOliver Bondzioand Ramon Zenker from\nDusseldorf in Germany. In a recent inter-view, Richie hae tin credited them with\nbeing instrumental in taking acid techno\nand being on the forefront of its dev elopement. To be quite honest, I was nervous\nabout this interview beforehand. Hardfloor have achieved so much commercial\nsuccess that i wasn't sure what I would\nencounter. Most of my guests have\ncome from and stayed in the under-ground. I met Oliver, and was instantly\nreassured. None of the attitude, just a really down-to-earth and friendly guy\nwith a big sense of humour to boot!\nHere's the interview...\nExplain Hardfloor.\nWe started the Hardfloor back in\n1991. We have had four albums so far,\nand in between the albums something\nlike twelve singles, we also did a lot of\nremixes for well-known people like\nDepechc Mode, Mike Oldficld, Thc\nShamen, etc.\nWhen you DJ, what Is your style?\nIs tsr ted up (the mix for the radio\nshow) with strange stuff like Cristian\nVogel, Neil Landstrumm and some tracks\noff my own new label, serial Killers Haircut. After that I played some acid tracks\nfrom our new album, then some straight\ntechno tracks. I'm also into house music.\nI can play instrumental, deep, jazzy stuff.\nI have a new house label called Gentleman's Haircut!\nHow did you come to discover electronic music?\nI was interested in groups like\nKraftwerk back in the 1970's, but I never\nthought of producing stuff because it\nwas too complex for mc. They had big\nstudios and expensive synthesizers. The\nfirst samplers were so expensive!\nI started DJing with hip-hop back in\n1983. I was on the breakdance scene\nwith scratching and all that. In 1986/7 I heard my first acid house records. That\nmade me think of producing my own\nrecords because it sounded so cheap, yet\npowerful. I only needed a drum machine\nand a303, which I could afford. Then I could make a track!\nDid you make music before Hardfloor?\nNo. Hardfloor was my first production pro jed. My partner Ramon did some\nstuff before, so when I met him, I knew\nhe had a studio. I asked him.if we could\ndo some tracks together. He was into it,\nso I played some old school acid tracks\nto him and that was the beginning.\nWorking as a group, does he still\nhave all the technical Input?\nNo. Now we have three big studios.\nOne is in my apartment where I can\nmake tracks on my own. But we also\nhave a studio for Hardfloor where we can\nproduce tracks together.\nWe have a really good flow together,\nmost of the time I tell ramon what I want\nand then he does it for me. We still work\nin the same way because he's the best\non the computer.\nThis Is your fourth album (All Targets\nDown). Most ele dr onic artists don't choose to express themselves on a full-length format. Why do you do this?\nWhen wc started I was to a tally into\nthe underground scene. I never thought\nabout doing a whole album. I just\nwanted to do some tracks. We then\nhooked up with Sven Vath for hart house and then ty eQ. They told us that they\nwanted to work with artists for a longer\ntime. They saw some potential in our\nwork, so instead of just doing one or two cp s they asked us to do an album.\nWe don't build albums around a con-ce pt, we put eight tracks together and\ncall it an album. Ramon and I both have\nlots of other projects on the side so we\nmade Hardfloor into a303 band.\nI 've noticed that some Hrdfloor\ntracks are more downbeat and slower in\nstyle. Does this come from your hip-hop\nroots?\nYes definitely. I'm really into hip-hop;\noriginally I was ab boy! I still love hip-hop\nand I'm thinking of doing an album with\nsome east coast rappers. I want to do the\nbeats. We have lots of talented scratch\nDJs in Dusseldorf.\nHardfloor was influenced by many\ndifferent styles of music, but we always\ntry to add the Hardfloor style at the end\nof a track.\nDo you still DJ the hip-hop stuff?\nNo. yo be honest i don't like the\nscene. Hip-hop clubs aren't really about\npartying, but just being cool. There's too\nmuch crime in the German hip-hop\nclubs. I prefer the peaceful, friendly feeling at hose parties and techno raves, foe\nme hip-hop is the sound that I listen to.\nHardfloor have remixed some big\nname bands. Did you find that when\nthe band had a big company behind\nthem, there was more pressure on you\nto produce the goods?\nwe started remixing underground\nartists. Then some major companies\ncalled us and asked us if we wanted to\nremix their artists with the typical Hardfloor big buildup style, but still incorporating poppy vocals. It was quite a new\nexperience for us so we tried and it did\nwell.\nWe didn't really feel pressure, the\nfirst remixes we id were from our minds\nand free ideas. The next mixes the companies asked for had to be the same\nstyle. They wanted everything done in\nthe same way so we copied ourselves\nand we tried to put our new and best\nideas into our own productions and not\nthc remix work.

Then ignore their advice\nand go anyway because the experience\nis worth any number of panic attacks.\nThere are, in fact, only two spider sculptures, but they are sufficiently compelling\nto frighten even the cynics. At first you\nsee a giant spider towering over a massive cage. Looking closer, the cage door\nis slightly ajar, inviting the unwary viewer\nto sit on a worn but comfortable chair...\nWill the spider gobble them up? The\nartist, Louise Bourgeois considers the\nspider to be a mother-figure; to me, the\nwhole installation just seemed sinister.\nBut Bourgeois loves people to interpret\nher art in their own way, after all \"the\nmeaning is not a mystery- the mystery\nresides in what you do with it.\"\nThe idea of spider as mother is just\none of the many bizarre yet original\nthoughts of Louise Bourgeois. Who could\nargue with her assertion that \"pain is\nthe ransom of formalism\"? Bourgeois is\nundeniably one of the giants of 20th Century art. Indeed, if experience mat-ter s, Bourgeois certainly has it in buck-et ful s, because at age 87 she has lived\nthrough most of the major art movements of the century. Bourgeois began\npersonal demons clearly informs her\nwork. Her art has always tackled feminism and the taboos of sex and death,\nbut more so now than ever. Recent work\nis highly cathartic: this is almost a last testament as she incorporates much of her\nemotional and physical (old clothes,\nk nick knacks) baggage into the sculptures. as a Maths student at the Sorbonne, but\nby 1 935 she had committed herself to a career In art. Three years later she emigrated to New York City and started\nsculpting.\nLittle Louise, her feminist mother,\nthe abusive husband and his ever-pre-sent mistress. Bourgeois is still haunted\nby this terrifying and confused childhood\nand the act of coming to terms with her\nMost striking arc the decapitated torsos suspended from gibbets. Some\nappear as ghosts and others almost as\nhanged men. They all have an undeniable eroticism (Bourgeois is known for\nthis) but they also have an eerie quality:\nmaybe they will come alive and grab\nyou without warning. It's all very spooky,\nso make sure you leave before it gets\ndark.\nThis one really sticks in my mind: a room, loosely enclosed by fragile walls\nand inside, a torso slumped on a chair,\nlo survey the scene you must peek\nthrough cracks in the walls,- you can\nnever gain a complete view. I felt as if I had stumbled upon a massacre. Imagine\nfinding a deserted cottage and catching\nglimpses of a corpse through the open\nwindow,- silence but for the buzzing of\nfl ics and the flapping of sheets on a washing line.

This is one of\nStephen Sondheim's most popular and critically acclaimed\nmusicals. It was written and staged for\nthe first time in 1987. Over the past\ntwenty-five years, Sondheim has created\nsome of the most inventive and appreciated musical theatre: highlights of his\ncareer include A little night music, Company and Passion, all recently staged in\nLondon with phenomenal success.\nInto the Woods is a brilliant recreation of childrens' fairytales. It combines\nCinderella, Jack and his beanstalk, Little\nRed Riding Hood, the Baker and his Wife\nwith of course a very nasty witch. All the\ncharacters play a particular role in the\nplot, but in this particular musical, their\nlives are linked by the woods. Sondheim\nlets his story unfold, as if the show was\naimed at a very young audience, so at\nthe end of the first part there seems to\nbe no more to say. However, this is\nwhere Sondheim's art comes into its\nown. In the second half, things\nstart getting a little cruel; all the\ncharacters search\nfor a way to kill the\ngiant's wife who\nhas been destroying their houses.\nEventually all ends\njust about well;\nthe giant dies but\nso docs most of\nthe little crowd.\nAs always,\nSondheim displays\na magical touch\nwith the music\nand lyrics, at the same time keeping a very rough edge, often reflecting upon\nhuman behaviour and relationships.\nDespite appear-ances, this show is\ndefinitely not for\nchildren because\nof its content. The\nmusic is lovely, the\nlyrics are very\nfunny and well\nwritten, typical\nstrengths in Sondheim's theatre.\nThe singing is\nadequate, certainly\nnot brilliant, but\nthen this is not a musical in the\nstrictest sense - the\ncomposer isn't writing for singers\nthat can act but\ninstead for actors who can just about\nsing. Although the quality of the singing\nis lost, wc get some amazing performances in return especially from Sophie\nThompson as the Baker's wife. Sheridan\nSmith makes a very cheeky and cute Little Red Riding Hood and Clare Burt is the\nsexiest witch this side of fairytale land.\nThis show is pure bliss, much better\nthan all the West End musicals put\ntogether. You will laugh endlessly and if\nyou go there with a child's eyes, you will\nbe charmed by the incredible magic on\nstage. This is theatre that everyone can\nenjoy and I can only encourage you\nwarmly to find out for yourselves\nD.

If you're wanting to see\nthe film then don't expect to do it on\nthe big screen, as it had its release way\nback in August (don't ask me why the\nsoundtrack won't be released until well\ninto January next year!). The film also\nstars Neve Campbell (Scream) and\nsome guy called Ryan Phillippe; a young, sexy, nothing-but-bow-tie-wear-ing hunk who will apparently be getting\nLeonardo DiCaprio status very soon\n(yeh yen!).\nBefore this turns into a film\nreview Is hou id probably talk about the\nmusic. This soundtrack is, surprisingly, a double CD compilation of, un sur pris ingly, some late 70's classics. I'm interested to know how they managed to\nplay all 32 of these tracks during the\nfilm. CD1 opens with If You Could Read\nMy Mind- a lovely, mellow track featuring the beautiful vocals of Ultra Nate. The\nrest of CD1 isn't any better than this, just\ncheesy 70's crap. Having said that, there\nare some nice moments due to the S.O.S Band doing the funky Take Your Time\n(Do It Right)and the uplifting guitar intro\nfollowed by charming vocals and a decent track taking the name of Please\nDon't Let Me Be Understood by Santa\nEsmeralda (already in the Christmas spirit\nI guess!). You just can't help bopping\nyour head to the classic Spank from\nJimmy 'Bo' Home and Blondie's Heart Of\nGlass. Before you take CD1 out be sure\nto play the first track again, it'll remind\nyou how the rest of the tracks fail miserably in comparison.\nMaybe it's because I don't really get off on 70's music, but there's nothing in this album that turns me on!\nThe only good tracks are the ones people know due to them being redone in\n90's style. I talk about tracks like Diana\nRoss (The Boss) covered by The Braxtons,\nDan Hartman (Relight My fire) redone by\nTake That and Sylvester's You Make Me\nfeel was updated into a brilliant 90's version by Byron Stingily.\nIn conclusion, the soundtrack\nis not much better than the film (going\nby its reviews), but if you just want some\nof these 70's tracks on CD then you may\nconsider buying this, otherwise just go\nto the movies three times with the cash\nyou save. CI\nAsad\nGRAND MAL\nMaledictions\nF rom outside it looked like a demo\ntape (even though it wasn't) but\ncomparing the contents to a demo tape would be an insult to all\nbudding musicians. Demo tapes have\nblood, sweat and tears stamped all over\nthem. It's probably the culmination of\nyears of practice and slogging through\nthe same songs again and again. The\ndemo may well be shite but at least you\ncan taste the eff ot. Grand Mai come\nacross as being overly influenced by\ntoo many people, resulting in an album\nwhich is patchy and lightweight.\nThe first song. Superstars is obvious\nfodder for the Best Rock Album tiller in\nthe World. If they were aiming to tap into\nthe retro-rock style then unfortunately\nthe retro (occasionally) glam/punk rock\nstyle that they have produced is un fashionably wide of the mark. Whole Lotta\nNothing has semi-an the mic potential\nbut lacks the balls to make it into anything more heavyweight. Out on a Bail\nis a retrospective disaster - Status Quo\nchords and honky-tonk piano which are\neasily twenty years out of date.\nYou Gotta Be Kidding has vocals\nremarkably similar to that of White Town,\nwhile Suckers Be? sounds horribly country and western and plods along like a lame horse, the singer obviously had a bad cold at the time but didn't help himself by sticking his head in a bucket\nwhile he sang it.\nThe only glimmer of hope within\nthe whole thing was Picture You (As\nAlways Falling) which is a semi-slushy/indie ballad and sounds surprisingly good compared to the dross that\nsurrounds it. However, it may well be a false gem, as it's hard to judge quality\nstatus when it's surrounded by drivel\nNone of the material here is capable\nof making a dent in the singles chart - not\neven the novelty of a 'one-hit wonder' is\non the cards. In short, Grand Mai are\nmost certainly not grand. H Katherine\nsingles\nKing - Come As You Are\nThis is bad - an Elvis impersonator with a deep voice covering Nirvana. Simply put, this song really should not\nbe sung this deep - it ruins it. Also, it would have been\nnice if the 'King' had actually got the right lyrics. Unsurprisingly New York New York fares much better. The\ncover of The Sweet's Blockbuster is the best thing\nhere, especially when the band decide to go rock n' roll.\nWithout the Nirvana cover, this may have been worth\nit.\nOne Lady Owner - Wheelklngs 1973\nThe title track is a piece of brooding electro-rock -there's an underlying hint of malice with vocals low in\nthe mix and with a bit of a Sisters Of Mercy feel. The\nband appear to have a serious car fixation: the songs,\ntheir titles and the band name. It's good to see an effort\nat continuity from someone. The best bit about this is\nthe bass which underpins things very well indeed.\nCatchers - Come Around\nCompetentiy done folk y rock, which is soothing and\nmellow for most of the time. The band also cope well\nwith pace changes. It still sounds like the same song,\nnot like they have decided to play something else for\na while instead. It's all very nice, but therein lies the\nproblem - there's nothing else to it. It doesn'tel ict much\nof a response. H Jamie\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON Radiator - Generator.\nOoh, it rhymes. Is that good or bad? In this case what's good is that these guys have reworked the Britrock style\nwith some jungle type beats and astoundingly they've\npulled it off. Radiator lean towards the heavy rock\nsound but with some mightily frantic drums too. Ihere's no information on the sleeve so, if this is their debut\nsingle, it's impressive. Spankingly different. El\nChristine\nLyden David Hall - Sexy Cinderella\nThe high vocals that dominate this song really suck,\nwhich means that the song does too. The second track\nis a remix that gets rid of most of the vocals and\nreplaces them with raps instead. Better, but still not that\ngood. The last track is an acoustic version of Medicine\n4 My Pain. It's actually not that bad. I'm sure lots of people will love this - it's just that I'm not one of them.\nBaaba Maal - Souka Nayo (I will follow you)\nThis is stirring and uplifting. Mainly this is a vocal track,\nwith some nice beats and what may be a guitar. There's also some nice breaks where brass and wind instruments come out and play. The other tracks are remixes,\nwhich leads to the question of who decided that it\nwould be a good idea? The nature of this is such that\nthe remixes don't work, which isn't that surprising\nreal iy. El\nJamie\nRobbie Williams - No Regrets\nAh, darling Robbie, you've come so far. A pleasant tune\nand no mistake. Not much to say about it really; take\none ex-Take That member, add a touch of shuffle y beats, love y lyrics and throw in some radio-friendliness\nfor good measure. Guaranteed not to offend.\nMalluka - Dancing In A Minefield EP\nSomehow, I don't think we'll be seeing this in the top\n10. It's yer generic pop-rock done to the same old\nthreadbare formula. There are four tracks and none\nstands out as a single but there is some nifty drumming\non Blue Light. It's all pretty dull really, except it has got\nthe word gimp on the sleeve. El\nChristine\n\n"

After a debate\nlast Monday, where speakers from\nUMIST, who have recently d is affiliated, and the NUS put forward their cases,\ntheir Union held a meeting to discuss the\nmatter. The outcome was unknown as\nFelix went to press.\nBioChem Blaze: Fire\nCrew's Six Hour Labour\nThere was panic in the Biochemistry\nbuilding on the afternoon of Friday 20\nwhen it caught fire. As part of a pilot plant\ndemolition builders were re-tarring an\narea of roofing. It is alleged that this set\nsome fibre-board in an adjoining wall\ncavity smouldering. Unfortunately, this\nhappened to connect to a cold room,\nused for genetic tests on plants, which\nwas insulated with asbestos-cement\nwalls.\nAt 4.45pm the fire alarm was set off\nand the building evacuated. The\nBioChem authorities, still unclear as to\nthe exact cause of the smoke, called the\nfire brigade. Fearing the worst, they sent\nseven fire engines and a special chemical spillage crew. The area was immediately sealed off and work was started to\nput the fire out and make safe the\nasbestos. This took them until 11.00pm that night. Despite all this upheaval, BioChemistry were very keen to make it\nclear that at no point was anyone in any\nserious danger.\nCharges Dropped\nCharges against one of the students\ninvolved in damaging the Southside barrier [Felix 1126] have been dropped.\nAnother student involved in the incident\ncould still face charges and is currently\npart of a police investigation. Ken Weir,\nChief Security Officer, was unable to\ncomment further until the police investigation is completed.\nOpen Verdict on\nStudent Death\nThe coroner investigating the death of a student in I is her Hall before the start of\nterm has recorded an open verdict. The\nstudent was found in his room by a sub-warden some time after he had died.\nThere had been some speculation that\nthe death may be suspicious, fuelled by\nrumours that the student's friend who\nwas with him on the day of his death left\nthe country before the body was found.\nThe coroner's report will hopefully end\nthe matter, showing the incident to be\na tragic accident.\nTwo Stand in\nUnion Elections\nTwo candidates have stood for the position of Deputy President (Clubs & Societies).

Voting will take place in all\ndepartments the following Monday and\nTuesday, with the results announced on\nTuesday evening.\nLost Property\nOn 15 October a coat was taken from\nFootlights in High Street Kensington. The\ncoat is believed to have been handed to\na group of IC students by mistake when\nthey were given their own jackets by the\nrestaurant staff. The navy coat is made by\nTommy Hillfiger and is blue, and had an\nEriksson mobile phone in one of the\npockets. The owner of the coat and\nphone has reported the incident to the\npolice.

Events in the pipeline for\nRag week include a hypnotist, a monopoly pub crawl, and hopefully the Royal\nCollege of Science Union Beer Festival.\nThe problems that have arisen with the\nbeer festival are due to College saying no\nto the use of the JCR. At the moment\nalternative venues are being looked at so\nfingers crossed.\nThis term we arc going to start running a cloakroom in the Union on Friday\nnights from 9pm until closing.

Brunei had to have beaten Bristol by more than 35 points to finish above\nIMRFC.\nAn exciting match saw 15 early minutes of stalemate with James Piatt's run\nto the corner in the 8th minute being the\nclosest thc medics came to an initial try.\nHowever, from that tun a platform of\npressure was built up, resulting in Chichester conceding a penalty only 15 yards\nfrom their line. A quick tap by Mike\nJackson, scrum-half, put Simon Neequaye, thc number 8, over for a try under\nthe posts. This was converted by Oliver\nKayes.\nThree minutes later and the medics\nwent further ahead through a try by\nJames Piatt in the corner which wasn't converted. This period of points scoring\nUltimate Frisbee\nImperial qualifies for National Student\nIndoor Finals!\nIhe Southeast Student Indoor Qualifiers\nwere held in Brighton during the weekend of the 21st. This was the first ever\ncompetition that the Imperial Ultimate\nteam has entered since it started at the\nbeginning of the year.\nIndoor Ultimate is played in a similar way to thc outdoor version, with a few\nchanges. Thc basic rules of no running\nwith the disc, and scoring in end zones\nare the same, but the indo ot pitch is\nsmaller, and you play with fewer players\n(5 a side, instead of 7). But apart form\nthat it is (almost) thc same.\nOur first game was at 10:30 on Saturday morning, so we had time for a bit\nculminated in a psychologically damaging push over try for the medics, again\nscored by Simon Neequaye. Another\nconversion meant that with still ten minutes to go to half time the medics had\nbuilt up a19 point cushion.\nSadly, a lapse in concentration\nresulted in a penalty being awarded to\nChichester right in front of IMRFC's posts,\nwhich was duly converted.\nThe best play of the first half however was reserved for the last move-ment. Quick ball spun wide, from a Chichester mistake, resulted in an exciting break from the halfway line by lain\nMcleod, who held his pass until just the\nright moment to scissor with the left\nwing James Piatt resulting in another try\nbeneath the posts. This interplay\nbetween these two players highlighted\nan understanding built upon match after\nmatch of playing together, and was evident all day.\nAfter half time, where Chichester\nmade four changes, the teams initially\nappeared more even and a converted try\nby the away side led to moments of\nworry amongst the many supporters pre-sent. However, with twelve minutes left\nPiatt rounded off his hat trick, again after\nof spec ta ting. Watching the first teams\nplay, we realised that perhaps at least\nONE indo ot practice would have been\nwise. It looked like a different game to\nthc outdoor one we were used to. We\nwere not too optimistic. But hey, it was\nour first competition, so wc just wanted\nto have a laugh. And besides, one good\nthing had come out the weekend\nalready, wc had a team name!\nHaving won two of our first th tec games we were through to the next\nround. Wow! No time for celebrating,\njust time to check to see who we were\nplaying. Hmmm. Because we had come\nsecond in our poo! (with the Skunks\nfirst), we had been drawn against the\nSussex Uni. Mohawks. This was the\nteam who had won the indoor finals\n(not just the qualifiers) the two previous\nyears. This was the team who were\nseeded first, and were looking like they\na well timed pass by Mcleod. This was\nun converted, but mindful of thc issue of\npoints difference necessary to te main ahead of Brunei, the medics pack\nappeared stronger and fitter than the\nopposition in the last ten minutes. Butlocking runs, especially by thc captain,\nBen Catpcntcr, and two younger players,\nBen Spicgleberg and Greg Thomas, gave\nSimon Rogers, the medics fly half, thc\nplatform he had been looking for all\nday, and his scything tun resulted in a subsequent maul on the opposition 22,\nfrom which he ran throught to score an\nun converted try.\nThe final play of the match, a quick\nthrow in, was taken with contemptuous\narrogance by Mcleod, within yards of two\nor three Chichestet players allowed James\nPiatt th tough to score his fourth and the\nmedics seventh try of the day.\nAll being well this pushes the medics\ninto European student competition next\nyear and in more recent times towards a relatively simple draw in the last sixteen of\nBUSA.

    "content": "8\nColumns\nBeit Underdevelopment\nY ou think you've seen it all, and then\nthey pull another one out of the hat.\nThe Beit Quad redevelopment is\nrapidly turning from an innocuous farce\ninto a disgrace. For those new to this\nparish, the College has been working\nout what to do with the space vacated by\nBiology and the accommodation part for\nages. There have been so many business\nplans produced that, if you had a pound\nfor every one written, you would just\nabout cover the hundreds of thousands\nwasted on consultants. Just when everything was looking fine and dandy, our\nSherfield brethren have decided that the\nUnion can't have the space promised\nthat allowed them to go ahead with the\nDBs expansion. There will be many casualties of this volt e face, not least Felix, and\nthat, dear reader, means mc. So why all\nthe problems? Surely it's just a case of\ntar ting the place up a bit and converting\nBiology, you say. Ah, the innocence of\nyouth. This is Imperial. We have bigger\nideas. We don't have halls of residence,\nwe have 'a mix of accommodation\nfavourable for conference/holiday letting purposes.' Naturally, this costs a lot\nmore than student dwellings - the latest\nplan suggests about \u00a354 per night for a single room. The costs of the project\nmean that we cannot afford to have half\nthe place empty during the summer - the\nlatest plan suggests 85% occupancy,\nwhich, according to thc hotel industry,\nequates to being fully booked. Starting to\nlook a bit tight, so maybe we need a few\nmore rooms. I know, we'll screw the\nUnion! Those daft sods still think we give\na damn what they think. Perfect!\nWhy, you may ask, are College hell-bent on achieving this at seemingly any\ncost? Do they really care so passionately\nthat our boys and girls should be housed\nin the lap of luxury. Of course not. It is\nno secret that the Rector has a dream of\ncreating his very own Cambridge-style\nquad here in SW7. Give it time and we'll\nhave Eric Liddell running around thc\nplace to the accompaniment of Vangelis. Not only lh at, but the Beit Quad project needs to be completed in time for\nthe British Association conference at\nImperial in summer 2000. With that\ndegree of political will, why sully one's hands with such sordid issues as financial viability? But it gets worse. The Conference Office is, as a result, moving\nmountains to force through this project.\nTheir success is obviously dependent on\nexpanding their empire, so they are also\nmore keen on the approval of thc pro-j ect, rather than the long term financial\nposition. Flow in God's name could anyone think that you can fill that many\nrooms for that much day in, day out.\nSuch occupancy levels arc rarely\nachieved in Prince's Gardens over the\nsummer, and if you strip out discounted\nrooms to language schools, thc proposition looks\nridiculous.\nBut, say the\nConference\nOffice, this accommodation is better\nquality. I don't doubt it, but in\nspending so much\non the refurbishment (\u00a311 million),\nyou have eroded\nthe price advantage that wc had.\nWould you really\nspend nearly \u00a360\nper night to sleep\nin a student hall of\nresidence, when a half-decent hotel\ncould be found at\nroughly the same\namount?\nNow as you\nknow, I bow\nto no one in\nmy admiration of the Conference Office,\nled by thc incomparable Annette De\nLima, a highly professional Individual; I know the great store in which she holds\nprofessionalism because she told Fe//x so last year at the time of her attempts to\nsue us for defamation. However, I fear\nthat over-exuberance has clouded their\njudgement. This has all thc hallmarks of\na disaster waiting to happen. I understand and applaud College's attempt to\nimprove its housing stock and commercial activities, but projects d ti ven by\nhopes and dreams of turning Imperial\ninto something it is not, or'shouldn't be,\nate not thc way. If thc Rector really wants\nto take the bull by the horns, he should\nmove Sherfield into thc Royal School of\nMines after its redevelopment, stick the\nUnion in Sherfield and fund the thing by\nselling or leasing out Beit Quad. It is not\npart of the main campus block and is\nworth a fortune. I accept thai Salman\nRushdie has voiced less heretical views\nthan that, but it's worth considering, solving a host of problems in one foul\nsweep.\nThird World First?\nfast Thutsday, while taking lunch at the\nSavoy Grill, the\nSimon Baker\nVoice of Reason\nsubject of\nThird World\npoverty came\nup, which\nreminded me of\nJacob Stringer's promotional piece\nfor Third World\nFirst. He quotes a variety of statistics,\nsuggesting that\ndebt repayment is\ncrippling the\nhealthcare and\neducation systems\nof many African\nnations. Many of\nhis figures are compelling but in acc u rate: According to\nthe World Bank,\nt thi opi a spends ten\ntimes more on\neducation that\nhe suggests, and actually has a better\npupil/teacher ratio for primary schoolchildren than South Africa, a country\nwhose economy is 2200% larger. Not a perfect situation, but better than he suggests. Tanzania does not spend six times\nmore on debt repayment than health-care, the true figure being about 1.5.\nThird World debt is not measured in tr il lions. The total for low income nations\nwas $318.3 billion in 1996, not pin\nmoney, I agree, but slightly more manageable than Jacob's figure Of more\nconcern were the numbers he did not\ninclude. For instance, Sudan spends\nmore than twice as much on defence as\nit does on healthcare. Mozambique also\n16 November 1998\nspends more on defence than health.\nLnough of thc stats. The problem of\nwholesale, unconditional debt cancellation is twofold. Firstly, it fails to address\nthe underlying causes of economic difficulty. Why should a government get its\nhouse in order, so that it may pay its\ndebt, rebuild its infrastructure and\nimprove the lot of its people when those\nnice men from the IMF will come along,\nwave a magic wand and make it di sap pear? This is to treat the symptoms rather\nthan the cause. Secondly, it penal is es those countries which have made the\neffort to sort out their debt situation by\ntaking sensible steps to restore their economic infrastructure rather than relied\npurely on international charity. Jacob is\nalso deluding himself that money saved\non debt servicing and repayment would\nautomatically be switched to health and\neducation. Debt relief and other forms of\naid, such as in Honduras during the\n1980s, have so often ended increasing\nthe defence budget, further exacerbating\nthc plight of those countries' citizens.\nEconomic restructuring does not mean\nstarving the women and children. It\nmeans dealing with governmental cor-rup tion, establishing proper financial controls and prior it ising money mote\nsensibly. If such a course of action is\ntaken, the IMF should obviously look at\ndebt rescheduling or cancellation. The\nsuggestion that this should all be unconditional is the sort of crypto-socialist, anti-Western capitalism statement that an\norganisation like Third World First would\ndo well to avoid making.\nSporting Profile\nRegular readers will know my admiration for Imperial's sports teams. Every\nweek, I diligently follow their progress on\nthe pages of Felix. All our boys and girls\nseem to be performing very well at the\nmoment, and it was good see Spag Bol,\nPink Gash and Spunk skinning the competition alive-o.I low ever, thc news was\nnot so good with regard to Cross-Country. Whither Swiss Cottage? What's going\non? And while we're on the subject,\nIndian Carpet Catalogue seems to be\nkeeping a very low profile this season.\nThe public should be told.\nSweet Dreams\nIt was a long way up to the top. The\nladder seemed to stretch to infinity\nand beyond. I tried hard to resist the\nannoying urges to look down. I failed.\nI lost my grip, I was falling. Falling, fast\ninto a gaping chasm, falling... falling.\nWoaoohhh... I wake up in a pool of\nsweat. I glance round my room. My\nillustrated book of Psychiatry cast aside\non my bed. I reach for the cold mug of\nNescafe (my fifth dose of essential caffeine therapy today)\nto dispel the d ty, arid\nfeeling in my throat.\nWith my bi ro,I frantically (before the\nthoughts escape my\noverloaded memory)\nmake another entry\ninto my dream diary,\nwhich is my 'thing' of\nthe moment; some-Dimple Devadas\nTHE FINE UNE thing to do during the\nmundane revision\nweek, another soon-to-pass fad.\nDreams arc just\nawesome, in fact\nl\"^ there's just no better\nI alternative form of\npure escapism. This is\nespecially true during\nexam times. When\nmost things including otherwise repetitious, redundant and boring American\nchat shows featuring the same people\nwith thc same problems seem interest-ing.\nMy fascination with dreams began a few years ago, ever since I realised that\nI had the power to control them. This\nkind of dreaming is called 'lucid dream-continued on page 9\n\n"

    "content": "30 November 1998 Editorial & Small Ads J^ fc7 The Devil is Back Again\nLast week I suggested that many of the\nworld's problems were caused by the\nconcept of currency, and specifically the\nnotion that material wealth is an aim in\nitself. College's handling of space allocation in Beit Quad [Felix 1127} is, to my\nmind, a prime example of this philosophy in action. Pound signs have won\nover promises, financial gain over Union\nfacilities. We are left with \"accommodation favourable for conference/holiday\nletting purposes\" which translates as\n\"rooms more expensive than most, built\nwith the sole aim of increasing the coins\nin College's pocket, with little or no\nregard for the actual requirements of\nstudents\".\nI, of course, have my own reasons\nfor being annoyed at the situation.\nCome next July Felix will, once again,\nhave to move, to a site yet to be decided\nupon. It's better than having to move in\nmid-November 1998, a proposal seriously suggested shortly before the start\nof term, but it's hardly ideal. Still, Felix\nand other Pub Board clubs can look forward to the new media centre as a more\npermanent home (unless, of course. College takes that back as well).

RCSU has been struggling due to\napparent indifference on the part of its\nmembers, while C& GU faced several\ncrises last year, and arc not exactly out\nof the woods yet. I know it's been said\nbefore, but can we really expect organisations based on historical factors that\nno longer exist to provide social and\nwelfare support for students?\nNew News\nYou have probably noticed the lack of IC\nnews in this week's issue. This could be\ndue to two main reasons. Lither events\nare happening and no one in Felix hears\nabout them, or else that th rce weeks-left-of-term quietness has descended over\nthe campus. Most likely both arc correct.\nSo please, if you hear of anything interesting happening, let us know.
