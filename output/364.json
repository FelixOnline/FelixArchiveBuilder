    "content": "FELIX11 AKCOftDo\nThe Best of BBC TV & Radio:\n'With Brass and Strings'.\n(BBC Records).\nThe BBC has managed to do it again\nin a totally uncoordinated album. It\ngets off to a robust start with the\nColonel Bogey March and then changes\nmood completely with Embraceable You\nand Spinning Wheel Samba to which the\nBand of H.M. Welsh Guards have\nmanaged to give a rather poor Spanish\nAmerican rhythm.\nSide two includes Eye Level, the\nvery popular theme music to 'Van der\nValk' and a totally un recognisable rendering (again by the Band of H.M. Welsh Guards) of the theme music from\nBBC 1's 'Softly, Softly'.\nStephen Richardson\nThe album finishes off with three\nstirring regimental marches L 'Attaque,\nCome Lasses and Lads, and I'm NinetyFive. All in all, a 'superb sampler'\n(quote from the cover). At 97p, going,\ngoing, gone!?\nLester Young: Prez In Europe\n(Polydore SELECT 2344 044).\nThis is Lester Young possibly not at\nhis brilliant best but definitely in fine\nform. The album is a collection of live\nrecordings made while he was in Europe,\nactually in Frankfurt playing at a club\nfor American servicemen. The sound\nquality is poor, as might be expected of\nsuch a recording.\nThe thing that strikes one is the\npredominance of tenor sax (Lester on all\nPaul Ekpenyong\ntracks) and drums, and hence not a lot\nof the other instruments. Here it is fair\nto point out that the back-up is rather\nweak.\nThe album starts off with Lester\nLeaps In w.hich embodies all the essence\nof the jazz spirit though it is rather slow\nin tempo. It also ends with the same\nmelody but this time the support is firmer.\nBy far the best tune on the whole\nalbum is There'll Never Be Another You\nwith its graceful, sinuous movement\nclimaxing in a fine solo. Other notable\ntracks are Lester's European Blues and\nLullaby of Birdland, the former a very\nblue fantasy and the latter seeing the\nawakening proper of the drummer. All in\nall an excellent album and worthy of\nevery jazz fan's collection.\nBOOKS\naro slav Hasek: The Good Soldier\nve jk: translated by Cecil Parrott\n(Penguin Books, 1974).\nUp until a year or so ago, the only\nEnglish-language version of Jaroslav\nHaSek's masterpiece The Good Soldier\nSvejk was the 1930 translation by Paul\nSelver. In his translation, Selver had\nreduced HaSek's original (uncompleted)\nmanuscript by about a third, pruning\nsome of the rather spun-out episodes,\nand removing altogether the dirty and,\nat the time, unacceptable anecdotes.\nEven in this truncated form, Svejk\nstood out as the masterpiece that it is.\nFor The Good Soldier Svejk is to the\nGreat War what Catch 22 is to the\nSecond World War, and M.A.S.H. is to\nthe Korean War. Good as Selver's translation undoubtedly is, however,\nthe new unabridged translation of Svejk\nby Cecil Parrott is just that much better.\nIt's difficult, of course, to see why in\njust a brief quotation, but one may get\nsome idea if one compares Selver1\n^\"-'Beg to report, sir, you've lost your cat.\nShe ate up the boot polish and now\nshe's gone and kicked the bucket. I threw her into the cellar \u2014 the next one,\nthat is'.\nwith Parrott's: 'Humbly report, sir, you've lost your cat.\nShe ate up the boot polish and permitted\nherself to pass out. I threw her into the\ncellar \u2014 but next door'.\nSomehow the phrase 'permitted herself to pass out' (reminding one not a little of Monty Python's parrot) has\nsomething more to it than just saying\nthat the cat 'kicked the bucket'.\nIn both translations, nonetheless,\nthe essence of Svejk shines through.\nSvejk is one of the first real anti-heroes.\nHasek started to write The Good Soldier\nSvejk shortly after the Great War and\nput a great deal of himself into Svejk \u2014\nfor Svejk is half-Hasek, just as Sherston\nin Memoirs of an Infantry Officer\n(dealing with Siegfried Sassoon's wartime experiences) is half-Sassoon.\nAnd two more different characters \u2014\nSherston and Svnjk \u2014 it is difficult to\nimagine. Sherston's( at least initial)\nbelief in the War \u2014 that it had some\npoint - is quite different from Svejk's; Svejk had no illusions or aspirations\nin the War whatever. The Good Soldier\nSvejk is quite unlike any other story,\nor memoir to come out of the Great War\n(think of Remarque's All Quiet on the\nWestern Front and Graves' Goodbye to\nAll That). For that reason alone, The\nGood Soldier Svejk certainly has a claim\non the time of anybody who is even a little curious about one of the biggest\nwars ever.\nBut even on the level of a pure story,\nwith no underlying moral, if such a thing can exist, The Good Soldier\nSvejk must be accounted a masterpiece.\nWith strong overtones of Til Eulenspiegel\nand, like the cat episode, Monty Python,\nSvejk's military career must be the\nfunniest ever recorded. At \u00a31.25 for\n750 pages of twentieth century masterpiece in a really good translation, how\ncan anyone go wrong?\ni Flynn O 'Brien: The Third Policeman\n(Picador).\nTHIS BOOK is not concerned with\nde Selby, the physicist and philospher,\nor his commentators, even allowing for\nthe lenght s of some of the footnotes (up\nto three pages). Nor is it about Phillip\nMathers, who T killed with a blow on\nthe jaw with a spade, nor even John\nDiveny, who first struck Mathers with his\nbicycle pump, and who planned the\nrobbery of mathers' box, which turned out\nto be full of omni um. It may well be about 'I' and his experiences with the nature, circular or\notherwise, of Hell. T, by the way, has\nno name, and this means not only is he\nimmune to the processes of the law, since\nthey cannot prosecute nobody, but also\nthat they can do no wrong in executing\nhim, because they will have killed no-one.\nHis rescue from certain death by the one-legged man is thwarted by MacCruiskeen\non a strangely coloured bicycle, or rather\nby a strangely coloured bike ridden by\nMacCruiskeen.\nAt this point, I should mention that\nde Selby thought right 'on in sanitary conditions of the atmosphere due to\naccretions of black air', and his various\ncommentators believe that his attempt to\ncure this phenomenon explain his large\nconsumption of water.\nThe book thrives on the apparently\nabsurd and it's explanation. While these\nexplanations do not extend to the complexities of a Tom Stoppard play, they\nrely on some new absurdity, which has\nto be explained later, or on some as yet\nundiscovered natural law, known only to\nthe two policemen. To follow the progress\nof 'I' you must accept each new absurdity\nin the same way T does, perhaps even\nto the point of believing Sergeant Pluck\nrather than '.Pa sensory reality. You must\nhumour Constable MacCruiskeen when\nyou can't see his boxes that are too small\nto be visible, as you must do when the\nSean Barker\nSergeant explains how the atoms in\nbicycles exchange places with those in\nthe owner, and thus how he was forced\nin one case to hang the bicycle rather\nthan its 'owner'.\nThis book is for anyone with a Dali\nposter, or who likes Spike Poe or Edgar\nAllen Milligan. It's not for Asimov lovers\nif they cannot accept the rational absurd.\nI was never sure, at least until the end,\nwhether T was somehow in another world,\nunder hallucination, or entering deeper\ninto madness, but for those who read the\nend first to find out such things, O 'Brien\nhas fooled them too, because however\nmuch of the end you read first, the book\nwill always end just before the bit you\nread. It's a book I'd buy if I did not\nalready have the review copy, and I cannot be fairer than that. And just in\ncase you read the blurb on the back\ncover to find out what it is really like, it\nis just as misleading as this is. The\nprice in Australia is only recommended,\nand not obligatory.\n\n"

    "content": "mix Exmowtki. Michael Williams\nWITH REFERENCE to the Tuesday\ngroan of a UGM, the question is What\nwent wrong? The number of minutes of\ninteresting discussion can be counted\non the fingers, and still leave sufficient\nanatomy to stifle a yawn. In terms of\nthe number of Union members in attend-ance, the benefit of the doubt must be\ngranted. Certainly Vic Feather is a great crowd-puller and theatre B in\nCollege Block, where he was presenting\nhis lecture, was a mass of bodies with\nan overspill into the corridors. But in\nterms of quality, the UGM was pusillanimous and uninspiring in the extreme.\nWhat happened to the promises of a dynamic leadership, the invulnerable\ninitiative, the infectious motivation?\nIt has been suggested that the reason\nwhy the meeting was so quiet was\nbecause it was under masterly control.\nIt could be stated what is the thought\nof that idea, but i& not Editorial policy\nto print ob ceni ties. Apologies are in order to John Allen,\nChairman of the Campus Radio Society\nCommittee. In the Valete section of the\nlast Editorial it was implied that one\nindividual was essentially responsible\nfor establishing Campus Radio and this\nwas what I had, in all honesty, been\nled to believe. It was a regretful error\nand no slight was intended to John and\nhis hard-working committee.\nBelated congratulations are extended\nto Ron Kill, the Deputy President for\nhis work connected with the Freshers'\nFair this year. As far as could be seen,\nall went very smoothly. There is one\naspect of the Fair which warrants\nhighlighting however. The distribution\nof Societies in the Union gave rise to\na reflection of Ron's subtle sense of\nhumour when it was discovered that\nGaysoc had been allocated a stall in\nthe Games Room.\nAs can be seen from the FELIX credits below, a Business Manager has\nfinally been appointed in the form of\nChris Keenan who is also Editor of the\nUSK Handbook this year. The term\n'Assistant Editor' is being discontinued\nand hence Paul Ekpenyong will be the\nFeatures Editor and Ramon Newmann,\nthe Photographic Editor. We should\nalso like to welcome Rob Jones on the\nstaff as the Sports Editor. There are\nstill vacancies for Reporters and News\nEditors. Anyone interested should\ncontact the Editor, preferably on a Monday or a Friday. We still need\ngeneral help on the production side,\nespecially Thursday evenings. Why not\ncome along and help out?\nFinally, there is absolutely no truth\nwhatsoever, in the malicious rumour\nthat the Executive were pissed out of\ntheir brains whilst assessing the Parking\nPermit Applications. All they had to\ndrink were a few cans of Fosters and\ntwo bottles of wine (apparently).\nLETTER STUDENTS AND POLITICS Electrical Engineering,\nImperial College.\nOct. 2nd.1974. Dear Sir,\nIn my past two years as an\nundergraduate at this college,\nI feel that ICU has played a fairly insignificant part in my\nacademic career. That is, of\ncourse,' apart from the services\nthat we tend to take for granted,\nsuch as entertainments, etcetera\nHere, I am stating a view which\nwould probably be shared by a large number of students, and\nmy grounds for saying this are\nthe meagre and unrepresentative\nattendances at UGM's. In fact,\nI would like to think that I am\nspeaking for the silent majority.\nProminent figures in the\nunion hierarchy bemoan the\nappalling 'apathy' of the\naverage IC student. However,\nmy own experience of UGM's in the past has been to sit and\nlisten, for a seemingly interminable period, to a succession\nof heated and boring arguments\nover relatively trivial details\nof a motion. Those who care\nenough (or, have fallen asleep\nin the interim) to remain for\nthe final vote, are frustrated\nin their hopes when the meeting\nbecomes in quo rate, because\nmost people have left to do\nother things. Nevertheless, the\nsolution to this problem is\nself-evident and I will not\ndwell on it. I fear that the real\ncause of the apathy in this\ncollege, and very likely others,\nis the inherent political nature\nof the student unions.\nThe primary aim of ICU is\nto represent the interests of\nthe students of this college\nand it is the responsibility of\nthe executive to ensure that\nthis aim is achieved before\ndebating time at a UGM is\ngiven over to other issues. I would guess that the major\nworries of students here are:\na) Where are they going to live?\nb) How are they going to afford\nbeing at college?\nc) How (sooner or later) are\nthey going to get through\nthe exams?\nFurther, students need to be\nprotected ' against possible,\nalthough infrequent, unfair or\ndiscriminatory action by the1 college authorities. It is pointless for ICU, or even the NUS,\nto attempt to be a politically\nactive body. For an organisation\nwith these aspirations, to have\nno intimate contact with the\npopulation of the country is to\nbe politically impotent. The\nNUS, let us fact it, does not\neven enjoy the support of\npublic opinion.\nAlthough only a minority of\nIC students have strong political views, which they have\na right to, be they right or left,\nLIX \u00a9\nMichael J.

Apart from a few unfortunate errors\nin the seating plan (for which I really do apo lig is e) the dinner\nwent off quite smoothly considering I organised it!\nMr. Stan Arnold's cabaret afterwards was nothing less than\nexcellent \u2014 and I'm sure noone who went to the dinner\n.could disagree. My thanks to\nMr. Arnold for making the\nevening so enjoyable.

So, I 've compromised\nand I'm insisting on people\nwearing masks. They'll be\neasy to come by at that time\nof year with Guy Fawkes night\nso near \u2014 or you could easily\nmake your own. Details of\nwhat will be happening, will\nappear in next week's FELIX, and on posters which should\nbe out next week, too. Tickets\nwill be available as from\nMonday, price 50p( see below).\nAll that remains for me to\nsay is I hope you will alt make\nan effort to come oh Halloween\n(though numbers by necessity\nwill be limited), and to thank\neveryone for coming on Monday.\nFor those of you who made\nparticular use of the bar ex-tension, I hope the effects\nhave worn off by now.\nN5\\>GI/T\\ JU^ - - - \" A ST iT DENT OF TODAY \" CREATED 6Y* RoN AfPlW\nK771'.11i1 I,II11.

This was followed by a routine,\nwell known to U GM addicts, of minute of the last\nmeeting and matters arising. John Carr, UL U President, made a short speech in which he outlined\nvarious aspects of Union life. This was followed by\nthe President saying\nsomething about refectories, the ladies loo\n(private quote: 'We do\nnot want to get bogged\ndown on that issue'),\nOverseas students and a few other things. The\nproceedings were slightly\nlivened up by a few yawns\nfrom some obviously bored\nmembers. There were a number of routine questions on refectories \u2014\nsome postgraduates complained that PG' s were\nnot informed of the 17Vi% price increase. Seeing as\nhow postgraduates in general take little or no\nnotice of the Union, one\nwonders what he was\ncomplaining about. Somebody else complained\nabout the food, but then\nthis is nothing unusual.\nThe Hon. Secretary said\nsomething about parking,\nand this was followed by\nthe Deputy President\nsaying something about\nsomething.\nThe next item on the\nagenda was Constitutional\namendments. The first\nset were non-contentious\nbut Just as discussion\nwas about to start on the\nPG Affairs Officer, somebody stood up and said\nthat since it was con-ten tio us, it should be\npostponed. Members\npromptly went back to\nsleep.\nTrev Phillips proposed\na motion on grants pertaining to the various\nanomalies; this was\npassed, the quorum was\nchallenged, those present\nwere woken up by the\nDeputy President banging\nVIC *T1C the discus with his gavel\nand saying 'the meeting\nis closed', and that was\nthat. It was a well deserved win by Lord Feather\nwho was giving a lecture\nsimultaneously.\nLORD VIC FEATHER was at\nImperial College last Tuesday\ngiving an Associated Studies\nlecture entitled 'The Political\nScene'.

Desperately in need of a place to lay\nyour weary head (and preferably large enough to accommodate\nyour SX 727 stereo equipment)?

For those of us sadly\nlacking in this useful commodity\na course of action is definitely\ncalled for. For most Freshers\nat I.F. who arrive in London\nnot knowing anyone, the obvious answer is to share a flat via the flat share columns\nin the papers. Having myself\ndone the daily round of telephone calls, beaten the weary\ntrack to estate agencies and\nrepeated my life history a few\nhundred times, I know the\nproblems only too well. First\npiece of advice: avoid the ads\nwith no phone number and just\nan address, at this time of\nyear you will turn up to find\nsomething resembling a dry\nparty in full swing and will be\nunable to see the colour of the\ncarpet for people, let alone\nthose responsible for the ad.\nNow, someone has got to get\ninto this flat and unless you\nare the absolute scum of the\nearth you stand as good a chance as the next person.\nYour main task is to convince\nthe other people by subtle\nmeans that you will be an asset\nto their little community.

Don't be\ntempted to overdo this. A little will go a long way. While\nthis is all ticking away in\ntheir little minds, leave your\ncard and waltz out. You're in.\nNow before I get accused\nof treating a serious problem\nflippantly, let me say that at\nthe present moment our Union\nis basking in its own glory\nhaving won a major victory in\nour struggle to get Union flats.\nAt the moment about 40% of\nI.F. live in flats, 30% in\nhostels and about 30% commute\nfrom home. Obviously it is the\nlast category which concern\nus because these are the poor\nunfortunates who dash out at\n4.30 a.m. to catch tubes and\ntrains and who are sadly\nmissing on the social scene.\nWe hope to make things easier\nfor them by taking p^^. the\nlease of a number of flats-fdr\nwhich the Union will be\nresponsible. So far we are tied\nup in the legal i ties of the\noperation, but things are\nmoving ahead and with a little\nluck and a lot of friendly\npersuasion, we might have our\nflats by Christmas.

    "content": "MU X INTERVIEW WITH\nFELIX: There has always tended to be a traditional\nresidue of antagonism against ULU by IC. It appears\nto stem from the old idea of IC being big enough to\nlook after itself. Could you comment on this?\nJohn Can: It is a problem in every collegiate University where you have got a central Union with strong\ncolleges. In the past you have not had a political student\nbody which has taken the central Union seriously. Last\nyear we had a Tory ULU president; when this state of\naffairs occurs, you usually are left with a fairly dead\nUnion because there is no real conflict and no real\nwork being done essentially. Now in Cambridge for\nexample, students are beginning to recognise the value\nof the Cambridge Students' Union which has no ties to\nthe University unlike the old SRC. Centralised Unions,\nthen, are for representing issues which affect students,\nco-ordinating initiatives and providing a strong backup for individual colleges.\nFELIX: Are you therefore implying, getting back to\nULU/Colleges antagonism, is that there exists a potential in ULU which the colleges must recognise if\nthey are to benefit from it?\nJohn Can: In a sence, everyone gets what they deserve\nand ULU has got what it deserves. The trouble has been\nin the past that the leadership of ULU never really fully\nworked out what ULU's role is in relation to the\ncolleges. ULU will never be in a position to usurp a college Union's authority; there are always specific\ncollege issues which only they themselves can discuss.\nFELIX: Leaving aside past leadership s and prejudices,\nwhat do you feel the role of ULU should be?\nJohn Carr: I should like to see it as the organisation\nwhich students from the colleges come to meet students\nfrom other colleges and Universities, and most import-ant ly, as a means of determining the common attitude\nto adopt at University level, and to work out the ways\nin which campaigns on the work which NUS is involved\nin, as well as specific issues which confront students\ncan best be organised to maximise their effect and\ntherefore, maximise the benefits which will accrue to\nthe students of the University.\nFELIX: Moving on from ULU just a fraction to USK, it\nappears to have lost a little of its impetus in the last\nfew years. Do you think in order to make USK a viable\nconcept that it needs a central office and a sabbatical\nco-or d in at or? John Can: When one talks of USK, one is really talking\nabout all the students in the Kensington area. Obviously,\nwhen you have got a lot of colleges involved, there is\nbound to be a lot of admin strat ive and routine work to\nbe done. Clearly then it needs someone who can devote\nall their time to it. So I would think that the idea of a USK Sabbatical is a good one.\nFELIX: There is, of course, already one USK Sabbatical\nwho is the Nightline Co-or d in at or. Do you think that\nasking for another might conjure up in the minds of\nCollege authorities the idea of Sabbatical proliferation\nand its inevitable associations with Trade Unions?\nJohn Can: This is a feature which has been manifested\nrationally. The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and\nPrincipals (CVCP) produced a report on Student\nSabbatical Officers. They have not seen fit to let us\nhave a copy of that report yet and we have not been\nable to obtain such a copy.\nFELIX: Moving on in an extended line from ULU through\nUSK to the NUS of who executive you are a member, can\nyou briefly describe the nuts and bolts of how the NUS\nExecutive works?\nJohn Cart: The executive is made up of seventeen\npeople. There are two regional area chairmen (for Wales\nand Scotland) which are elected at the appropriate\nregional conferences. Both are sabbatical. The remaining\nfifteen are elected at the annual NUS Easter conference.\nOf those fifteen, four are sabbatical: the President,\nthe National Secretary, the Deputy President and the\nNational Treasurer. The rest are essentially part-timers.\nBy being on the NUS Executive, my position as the\nPresident of ULU is strengthened immensely. There is\na healthy overlap of interests between ULU and NUS.\nFELIX: On the subject of overlapping one's responsibilities, Trevor Phillips, our own Union President\nis certainly diversifying his interests. In addition to\nhis post in ICU, he is also Chairman of the ULU\nStudent Representative Council (SRC) and at a member\nof the Joint Committee of the Senate and the SRC as\nwell as being on the ULU Executive. Can this be\ndescribed as a healthy overlap?\nJohn Can: Yes, indeed. Healthy cynicism of this sort\nis welcomed. It might become a little disturbing though\nif that were always the immediate presumption, i.e. if\nsomeone diversifies their interests then they are just\ntrying to carve out a career for themselves. In Trevor's case, he is, in fact, much closer to the mainstream of\nevents in the University which have direct repercussions\non the students here at Imperial. He is in a much better\nposition to do his job as President of ICU by virtue of\nthe fact that he is so involved in ULU.\nFELIX: John Carr, thank you for talking to us.\nJohn Can: My pleasure.\nHALL\nDiNNBrlS\nThese take place every Tuesday this tana in\nCollege Block.\nPrice: 95p Sherry: 5p at the d in nar. Bookings will be tak an from Thursday morning\nto Friday lunchtime (Deadline at 1.00 p.m.) the weak before.\nForms are available in the Union Office.\n\n"
