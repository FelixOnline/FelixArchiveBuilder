    "content": "Union Lounge\nThe Department of Pure\nand Applied Biology first\nI expressed an interest in\ntaking over the Lounge at\nthe end of last year They\nclaimed that they had\ninsufficient laboratory\nspace. At that time Ian Bull,\nwho was then President,\nobjected strongly because,\nin his view, the Lounge was\nneeded as it was the best\narea for parties and bands.\nAt the time, Ian attempted\nto get College to agree that\nthe whole of the north side\nof Beit should come under\nUnion control. College\nagreed verbally that this\nwas a good idea.\nUnfortunately, they failed\nto agree to this in writing.\nNow College have decided\nthat they can make money\nby moving part of the\nBiology department from\nSilwood to South\n\u2022 Kensington. As a result\nthey need the Lounge to\nmake extra space for the\ndepartment by converting\nthe Lounge into lecture\ntheatres so that other\nlecture theatres can be\nconverted into labs. All the\npromises about keeping the\nUnion free for the Union\nhave been forgotten.\nIan Bull was right when\nhe said that the Lounge\nwas the only room suitable\nfor parties. It is the only\nroom that is the right size\nand decor for parties (ie\nisn't like the J CR which\nreminds one of an airport\ndeparture lounge) which\nisn't near enough to\nresidents to attract\ncomplaints about noise (the\nNew Year Party attracted\ncomplaints from residents\nwho could hear the concert\nhall). College don't need\nthe number of lecture\ntheatres they have at\npresent. The UGC have\nreported that the College\nhas too many lecture\ntheatres. College should\nremember that students\nneed a social life.\nUnfortunately, College\nseem to have link the\ntakeover of the Union Bar\nto the Lounge. They seem\nto think that we should\nswap the lounge for the\nBar. Without the Lounge\nwe risk losing a large\namount of money on the\nBar. Many of the events\nthat make the most money\nfor the Bar are the parties\nthat we can't hold without \u00bb\nthe Lounge.\nThe policy that Union\nCouncil adopted on\nMonday attempts to treat\nthe Bar and the Lounge as\nseperate issues. The Bar\nand the Lounge are\nseperate issues. The Union\nneeds the Lounge. It has\nhad control of the Lounge.\nTo have it taken could ruin\nmuch fo the good work\ndone by Ents. The Union\nshould have control of the\nBar. The Union Bar is a student bar and as such it\nshould be run by students\nfor students.\nSixth former s are\nbecoming choosy about\nwhere to go to college. The\nRector is particularly\nworried about how the\nquality of applicants is\ndropping. One factor that\nsixth former s are starting to\nlook at is the quality of the\nsocial life. Isn't it possible\nthat conversion of the\nLounge into a lecture\ntheatre and subsequent\nworsening of the social life\nwill reduce the quality of\napplicants to IC further.\nHopefully, the new Rector,\nProf Ash, will realise that\nhis administrators are\nmaking a mistake when\nthey advise him to support\nBiology's takeover of the\nLounge\nSTOIC\nIn this issue there are\nseveral references to an all\nnight programme to\nbroadcast on STOIC.\nUnfortunately, this will no\nlonger take place. The\nElectrical Engineering\nDepartment have refused to\nallow them to broadcast it.\nThis programme had the\nsupport of the TV studio\nneeded. A bureaucrat who\nneeded to do nothing more\nthan sign a piece of paper\nruined STOIC'S chance to\nimprove their image.\nLast Week\nLast week's FELIX certainly\nseemed to have stirred\npeople up. Firstly an\napp ology, I accept that\nDave Kingston did not lose\nthe hall bills as stated in\nBelow the Belt. I ap polo g is e for any damage\nthis has done. Secondly I'd like to point out that the\nperson shown being\narrested on page 4 did not\ngate crash the party. Finally\nI'd like to say that Carl\nBurgess and Dave Kingston\nboth say that Carl was not\npissed when he meet John\nSmith last week. The three\nsenior officers who claimed\nhe was pissed still say he\nwas. I leave it to you to\ndecide.\nPhoto Competition\nFELIX and Photosoc are\nrunning a photographic\ncompetition. Please submit\nportfolios of prints to the\nFELIX office by the end of\nterm. The winning entries\nwill be printed in FELIX.\nCredits\nMany thanks to Tony\nChurchill, Rosemary\nHosking, D Matthew Jones,\nBill Goodwin, Richard\nSmith, Andy Vickers, Sunny\nBains, Richard Ellis, Sarah\nKirk, Ian Thomas, Chris the\nphotographer (sorry I forgot your surname), cnn s Edwards, Tracey (sorry\nagain), Jane Spiegel,\nKamala Sen, Jim Clayton, J Martin Taylor, Debbie\nWilkes, Mark Cottle, Nige\n'Slim Jim' Atkinson, Grenvil\nManuel, Dan the cartoonist,\nPaul Bashain and everyone\nI 've forgotten.

In fact, Dave took\ngreat care when checking\nthe bills and found certain\nrevisions were required\nbefore he was prepared to\nauthorise payment. All\nparties concerned were\naware of the situation, had\nit well in hand and at no\ntime what s over was the\nUnion in danger of being\nliable for the \u00a315 late\npayment charge.\nI have no idea who\nRatfink is but I should be\ngrateful if you would\nensure that, in future,\nhe/she/they check stories\nmore thoroughly. Once\nerroneous information gets\ninto print, the damage has\nbeen done.\nSincerely,\nJen\nUnion Administrator\nHoly Pork Meat,\nBatman\nDear Sir,\nI wish to make a strong\nprotest about seriously\nmisleading information\nwhich appeared on the\nSouthside menu on Oct\n31st. On entering the\nrefectory that evening I noticed a dish featuring Bat\nmeat. Believing this to be a local delicacy I decided to\ntry some. Only after eating\nseveral mouthfuls did I discover that I was in fact\neating Pork. My religious\nbeliefs now com pell me to\nbeat my head against a wall\nten times each day before\nbreakfast, for a period of\none lunar month, in\npenance of this act. This is\nnot a good thing I can tell\nyou!\nYours devoutly\nCarl Mottke\nPerverse Pose\nDear Hugh,\nWith reference to the letter\nfrom Oliver Smart in last\nweeks FELIX. Mr Smart will\nbe pleased to know that the\npicture on the poster in\nquestion does not in fact\nshow a man being\nsuspended from his wrists\n(which apparently leads to\ndeath after an hour due to\nas phi xi ation), but a man on\na rack, which I am assured\nis much less pain full. As to the source of the\npicture, I was unable to\npersuade members of the\nGuilds exec to pose, so I resorted to copying it from\nan infamous source of\npervert ion and torture. An\nadvert for an investment\ntrust on the financial pages\nof the Daily Telegraph.\nYours\nRichard Davis\nPublicity Officer\nCity and Guilds Union\nUnion Health Warning:\nHumour can seriously\ndamage your health\n2\nFriday 15 November FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Hockey\nIC Hockey 1st XI\nYet again the 1st XI has\nhad a full weeks hockey,\nwith matches on\n| Wednesday, S^ur day and\nSunday.\nThe Wednesday UAU\nI match against LSE ended\n| up with a solid 3-0 win with\nI goals from Morris, Justin\ni and Paul. Although the\n| game was unremarkable for\n| its hockey, it has ensured\n\\ that we will be going\nI through to the next round\n| of UAU.\nSaturday's match against\nBrunei University in the\nI Middlesex League proved a| much tougher match. IC\n| played well as a team\n| against a very fit attacking\n1 team. However, by half time\n| IC were 1-0 up after a fine\n| breakaway goal from star\n| guest, Nick Hope.\nI Unfortunately Brunei\nI levelled the score at 1-1 in\n| the second half, and\n| despite strong pressure\n|from IC to take the lead \u2014\ni the game ended drawn.\nTo end the week. 6\n1 players congregated at\nMotspur Park for the ULU 6\nla side \u2014 reporting various\nI degrees of damage due to\nJon Stonham's party,\nfortunately he won't be 21\nevery week! Much to our\nI surprise the team proved\ntoo strong(?) for QE C(20), Goldsmiths (1-0 extra\ntime), London Hospitals (1-10). Unfortunately our run\n\u2022ended in the semi-final,\nI losing to our old rivals and\neventual winners UCL.\n,Special mention for Jon\nWest's brilliant flick saving\nduring the tournament, '5\n.out of 7 ain't bad'\nIC 2nds1 Royal Arsenal 1\nSaturday produced a disappointing 1-1 draw for\nthe seconds in their\nfriendly (???) against Royal\nArsenal.\nA brief break in the\n! monsoon conditions\nafforded us a fairly dry\ngame despite the onset of\ni Hurricane Anna in the latter\nstages of the match. A i| perfect start saw the ball\nIrattle against the\noppositions backboard in\nthe first minute. However\nIC failed to fulfill this early\npromise, perhaps due to\nthe umpires somewhat\n'imaginative' use of the\noffside rule or to the\nArsenal goalkeeper's imposition of a ten yard\nexclusion zone any\nHockey\nWednesday\nUAU\nMens\nIC\nLadies\nIC\nULU\nMens\nRCS\nChelsea\nSaturday\nMens\nIC\nRoyal Arsenal\nIC\nLadies\nULU Cup\nIC\nFootball\nWednesday\nUAU\n1sts1 sts1 sts3 rds LSE\nLSE\nK CH Mines\nBrunei\nIC\nHarlow\nSt Barts\n1sts1 sts is ts2n ds3 rds IC 1sts5 LSE Ists 2\nIC 2nds4 LSE 2nds0 IC 3rds2 LSE 3rds6 ULU League\nLH 3rds1 IC 5th s2 Saturday\nULU Cup\nIC 1sts4 UCi sts1 IC 4th s3 New 1sts1 IC 6th s5 UC 7th s3 Rugby\nWednesday\nUAU\nIC 1sts40 LSE 1sts0 IC 2nds51 LSE 2nds0 Friendly\n4th s8C&G2 nd s13UCH4 th s8 incursion into which\nresulted in immediate\nexecution.\nUnfortunately the\nopposition managed to\nstrike back with a very\ndubious goal whilst IC were\ndistracted by Andy's excellent Torvill and Dean\nimpressions.\nSome consolation was\ngained at the end of the\nday with the knowledge\nthat the Ministry of\nTransport are going to\nbuild a motorway through\nRoyal Arsenal's clubhouse.\nThe afternoon was\nrounded off in traditional\nstyle with another sing-a long with Johnson session*.\nbetween two he s titan t LSE\ndefenders and placed the\nball underneath the\nadvancing keeper. The\nsecond came from a powerful header from\ncentre-back Lawrence\nCovill from Tom Dutton's out swinging corner. LSE's tactic of playing the offside\ntrap failed leaving Paul\nBravery to round the\nkeeper and risk permanent\nattachment to the goalpost\nin poking the ball home to\nmake the half time score 3-0.\nIC's fourth came when\nTom Dutton beat several\nLSE defenders and shot\npast the keeper beating him\nat the near post. LSE pulled\none back when slack\ndefensive work allowed an\nLSE striker to score from\n12 yards.\nDave Lynne held off\nseveral challenges in\nfreeing Guy Poppy to score\nfrom 12 yards out to make\nthe score 5-1.\nLSE scored a further\nconsolation goal before\nPaul Bravery missed a golden opportunity to\nincrease IC's lead by\nplacing a penalty a yard\nwide of the goal after Guy\nPoppy had been brought\ndown in the area.\nFootball\nLondon Hospital 0 - IC 5th s2 A superb performance by\nIC against a good London\nHospital side was ample\nrevenge for last year's100 drubbing. In a tight first\nhalf, IC's forwards found\nthe going hard against our\nopponents sweeper system,\nbut the IC defence gave\nnothing away and no\nsloppy early goals were\nconceded as in previous\ngames.\nIn the second half, IC\ngradually took control with\nChris, Dave and Stavros\ntaking a grip on the\nmidfield. With about twenty\nminutes to go, Mark\nWoodgate scored from\nNigel Johnson's corner to\nput IC in the lead. Nigel,\nwho'd scored a brilliant\ngoal in the previous game\nagainst K QC VI, also took\nthe corner from which Mark\nscored his second goal ten\nminutes from time. The\nwhole side played well and\ndeserved this victory.\nIC 1sts5 LSE 2\nIC kept alive their hopes of\nqualifying for the knockout\nsection of the national\ntournament with another\nsolid performance against\nLSE.\nAfter a shaky start IC\nsettled down to produce\nsome excellent flowing\nfootball. The first IC goal\ncame when Dave Lynne ran\nRugby\nIC 1sts40 LSE 1sts0 After the previous week's charade against Kent,\ncaptain Rob Hargrove\ndelivered in his inimitable\nIrish brogue, a 'Wrath-of-God' style pre-match talk to\nthis vital U AU qualifier. IC\nrose to the challenge,\nscoring 7 exceptional tries,\n6 converted by the disbelieving Neil Folland.\nOur 'Wednesday' winger\nscored 3 tries, on each\noccasion leaving the LSE\ndefence in his slip-stream.\nScrum-half, Ian Hutchison,\nwho scored 2 tries, utilised\nthe blind-side of the scrum\nto excellent effect and\nacted as a perfect link\nbetween the marauding\nforwards and silken backs.\nThe front five were\ndominant in the tight play,\nleaving the back-row trio to\nexcel themselves in the\nloose. Flanker, Stephen\nParker, scored 2 fine\nrunning tries, the latter, a30 yard effort, outstripping\ntheir defence. IC could\nhave capitalised more in\nthe final quarter of the\nmatch, but with the score\nalready at 40-0, and LSE\ndown and out, there\nseemed little point.\n12 Friday 15 November FELIX\n\n"

The identity of the hijacker is unknown but it is\nrumoured the raid was organised by a sinister mastermind\nin Mech Eng Security.\nPresidents\nprotest\nPresidents of all the\nLondon college unions\ntook the opportunity to\nexpress their concern over\neducation cuts at the\nUniversity of London\nFoundation Day on\nWednesday. They are\ndissatisfied with the\ndisruption caused by recent\ncollege mergers and their\nnegative effects on\neducation. The University,\nthey say, has shown 'a lack\nof consideration' for the\nstudents affected. As a sign\nof protest the union\nrepresentatives dressed in\nblack and refused\nrefreshments.\nTony Millns, Publicity\nOfficer for the University of\nLondon, commented 'It is\nsad that the students don't understand that the\nrestructuring is in the\ninterest of future students.\nHe added that the\nUniversity is 'under\npressure to achieve\nrational is ation' from the\ngovernment, and that\nrestructuring will ensure\nthe best use of resources.\nDuring the ceremony\nPrincess Anne, Chancellor\nof the University of London\npresented nine honorary\ndegrees.

The act featured\nalternative humour, bizzar e stunts with paper bags, and\na good deal of audience\nparticipation. Comments\nfrom the onlookers ranged\nfrom 'interesting' to 'weird'\nand 'amazing'.\nSmith strikes\n...from front page\nreceived any written\nconfirmation of this. Mr\nShackley added that Mr\nSmith saw the transfer of\nrooms and the takeover of\nthe Union bar as a single\nissue, whereas the Union's view had been that the two\nmatters were unconnected.\nGuilds President Roger\nPreece criticised Mr\nBurgess for not calling a meeting of the Union\nExecutive upon receipt of\nMr Smith's letter. Publicity\nofficer Adrian Johnson was\nconcerned that Mr Burgess\nhad not registered any\ncomplaint over the timing\nof the letter. Mr Burgess\nwas also criticised severely\nfor his handling of the\nnegotiations to take over\nthe Union Bar. He was\nasked why he had allowed\nMr Smith's draft paper to\nbe presented unchanged\nat House Committee,\ninstead of implementing the\nchanges recommended by\nthe Union Planning Group.\nMr Burgess replied that he\nconsidered the revised\npaper far too woolly and\ndid not think that House\nCommittee would have\npassed it. This explain ation was rejected by Council.\nFor more news of Council,\nsee page 4.\nCooking\nthe books\nSeveral Union officers\nexpressed concern about\nthe finances of the\nBookshop at Council on\nMonday. They were worried\nabout the levels of stock\nkept by the Bookshop and\nby the size of the\nBookshop's overdraft.\nDeputy President, Dave\nKingston, told FELIX that\nhe wouldn't comment until\nhe had had time to discuss\nthe situation with the\nbookshop manager.\n3-day Don\nStudent Services Officer\nDon Ferguson is working a three-day week. From the\nstart of term Mr Ferguson\nhas been spending\nTuesdays and Thursdays\nstudying for an MSc degree\nin the Department of\nComputing.\nFinance assistant, and\nformer ICU Deputy\nPresident, Dave Parry said\nthat the absence of Mr\nFerguson from the office\ntwo days per week did not\naffect the running of\nStudent Services. FELIX\nattempted to contact Mr\nFerguson on Wednesday,\nbut were told that he was\nout of the office for the\nday.\nSex rules\nDeputy President, Dave\nKingston intends to\npropose changes in the\ndisciplinary rules at the\nnext Council that will make\nsexual harassment an\noffence. This follows an\nincident at the Civil\nEngineering Freshers'\ndinner when a woman had\nher dress ripped. If the\npolicy is adopted it will\nmean students guilty of\nsexual harassment could be\nfined or banned from the\nUnion building.\nBalls\nA set of 6 coloured snooker\nballs was stolen from the\nUnion snooker room on\nWednesday night.\nFollowing a spate of such\nthefts last year, the snooker\nclub cannot afford to\nreplace them.\nThe club wants the balls\nreturned, and will ask no\nquestions.\nShaving foam and vomit flowed at the RCS Beer Festival\non Wednesday.

Islam,\nunlike all other religions,\nhas two main books.\n1 The Qur'an which is the\nword of Allah (God) as\nrevealed by the Angel\nGabriel to the Prophet\nMohammad.\n2 The Hadith which is a record of the sayings and\nactions of the Prophet\nMohammad.\nIslam does not claim to be\na 'new' religion or kind of\nfaith. The word Islam in\narabic means submission\nand resignation and it it is\nderived from a word\nmeaning peace.\nThe Qur'an is the basic\nsource of the Muslim's faith\nand practice. The first few\nverses revealed from the\nQur'an to the prophet\nMohammad were:\n1 Proclaim! (or read), in the\nname of thy Lord and\nCherisher, who created.\n2 Created man, out of a hanging drop!\n3 Read! And thy Lord is\nmost bountiful.\n'-He who taught (the use\nof) the pen.\n5 Taught man that which\nhe knew not.\nIn these five, first\nrevealed, verses of the\nQur'an the main subject is\nto learn and search for\nknowledge for the sake of\nAllah (God). Also, from the\nprophet's sayings: he said\n'seek knowledge from the\ncradle to the grave'.\nI would like to ask where\ndoes this stand in\ncomparison to what Islam\nis being accused of these\ndays?\nThis is a brief\nintroduction to the\nmisunderstood Islam, this\nmisunderstanding resulting\nfrom the extreme attitude\nof the west.\nJewish Society\nThe Jewish Society, though\nabsent at Freshers Fair this\nyear, is alive and well, and\nhas arranged a number of\nevents this term. We hope\nthat Friday night meals will\nbe a regular feature this\nyear, as always. They are\nnotable for their informal\nat mop here and the\ncopiously flowing Israeli\nwine.\nThis week (Thursday, 21\nNovember at 1.15pm in the\nUnion SCR) we'll be having\na speaker meeting at which\nRabbi Danny Kirsch will be\nthe invited guest. He is a very entertaining speaker\nand his subject will be 'The\nMarlborough Man,\nMerchandizing and\nme'\u2014Confused? Come\nalong and find out what on\nearth he's talking about.\nAnother major event\ncoming up is the Soviet\nJewry Vigil outside the\nSoviet Embassy on the 19\nand 20 of Novmember\u2014to\ncoincide with the tenth\nanniversary of the Helsinki\nAgreement on Human\nRights. It will be a48 hour\nvigil during which we'll\nprobably do some active\nlearning of the Torech,\netc\u2014in order to\ndemonstrate to the public\nwhat we, in the West,\nconsider a basic human\nright, yet which is\nforbidden to Jews in the\nSoviet Union. If you can\nspare an hour of your time\non these two days, please\ncontact Josie Glausuisz,\nLife Science 3 for more\ndetails and for any other\ninformation about the\nJewish Society.\nSF Soc\n'So you are looking for the\nSF Soc article!' The old\nmans eyes bored into my\nskull, sharp as diamonds.\n'Yy yes'. I stuttered,\nunnerved by his intense\ngaze. I closed the wooden\ndoor to his dilapidated\nshack and stepped gingerly\ninto the hovel.\n'Well don't just stand there.\nSit down!' He commanded.\nI looked around. There\nwas no other chair but the\none on which the man was\nseated.\n'Urn..' I began.\n'sit!'\nI sat.\n'So you wish to learn\nabout the article'.

It's bath time\ntonight, and let's face it, this could be\nyour first bath of the week. Out comes\nyour hair dryer, a clean shirt, your.-strongest deodorant, a new bottle of\naftershave perhaps, or a little make-up.\nor both? You're looking good, you tell\nyourself. Your reflection leers back at\nyou unconvincingly, but then that\nalways was a crappy mirror. Now\nyou're on your way/back to college.\nYou're getting excited. And why?\nBecause tonight's the Guilds Carnival\nof course\u2014a fun filled night of song\nand dance is ahead of you. Bands,\nfilms, poetry, jazz, discos, food, drink\nand cocktails await to delight your\nsenses. No wonder you're\nexcited\u2014who wouldn't be with all that\ntoo look forward to?\nWell, let me take this opportunity to\nhave a good moan, because I shall\ncertainly not be excited, nor shall I be\nlooking forward to the night ahead: A fun filled night of watching the front\ndoor, getting the bands to go on stage\non time (which they never do, in case\nyou hadn't noticed; 'just another ten\nminutes', they say as they sit having a nice chat to each other, scoffing all the\nfood and drink which they insist you\nprovide 'as ref es hm ents'), moving the\nPA out, setting up the films, doing the\ndiscos, and, my special favourite,\nclearing up afterwards. Sounds like a lot of fun eh?.\nProbably the one remotely enjoyable\nthing I shall do all night is to make you\nlot suffer the in dig in it y of having your\nhand stamped with a horrible inky\nblotch to show that you've paid. You\nmay feel that sometimes we hit you\nrather unnecessarily viciously with our\nrubber stamp, but do please try to\nshow a little understanding. You see,\nfor people like me, Carnival started a long time ago, phoning up the agents\nto see what bands they had available.\nHave you rung up an agent? No? Well\ntake my word for it, you'd just love it.\nThen comes the real fun, as if chatting\nto all those lovely, lovely agents wasn't enough\" you embark on 8 desperate\nrace against press and publicity\ndeadlines, most of which will have\npassed by the time your Bne-up is\nfinalised.\nAs the day draws hearer the worries\nstart to multiply and your friends start\nto get a pit sick of your one track\nconversation. FELIX generously offers\nyou a whole page devoted to your\ncarnival, provided you write it (and isn't it amazing what crap you come out\nwith?). You develop a nervous twitch\nand start running around in little\ncircles.\nAnd so, after all the effort, the sweat,\nThe tears, and the telephone calls, what\nhave we got for you?\nMisty in Roots\nNeedless to say, as befits a band\nwith the more or less legendary status\nof Misty even outside of Reggae circles\n{in which they surely have few equals)\ntheir agents are complete bastards to\ndeal with. The last time they played in\nCollege, their agent, who we'll call Ollie\nfor the sake of argument, forgot to te it them about the gig until 4pm on the\nday. We've made quite certain that they\nknow this time.\nAttila the Stockbroker and Seething\nWells\nQuite possibly you haven't read the\nbook 'The Rising Sons of Ranting\nVerse' by these two. On the other hand,\nyou probably did read the piece in\nTime Out a few weeks ago, in which\ncase you'll know what to expect. In\nAttila's own words. I try to combine\nentertainment with ideas and if I can\nget up on stage and get a good\nreaction from people who don't normally listen to poetry, then I think\nI'm getting somewhere'. His pet hates\nare, amongst others, 'the wimpy Nigel,\nvegetables, Sun readers, and his\nobsessions: 'football, flatfish and Jean\nPaul Satre'. He also leaves rude\nmessages on his answerphone.\nCircus Circus Circus\nWe reckon this band really are 'The\nNext Big Thing'. If you ever wondered\nwhat Cliff Richard and the Shadows\nwould have sounded like had Cliff been\nin to se^and drugs and Hank and the\nboys into Rock and Roll (yes, I suppose they were, but don't spoil it)\nthen this, is the band to watch.\nWoza\nWoza have already been The next\nbig thing'. That was last year, when\ntheir brand of what can best be\ndescribed as Motown on speed had\nearned them headlining gigs at several\nScottish University's Freshers' Bails.\nUnfortunatfey the band broke up\nbefore they got around to playing at\nthem. This year, the re-formed Woza\nventure down to London for the first\ntime. We hope they can manage not to\nsplit up again on the the journey\ndown...\nFreefall\nA touch of class here.

Cocktails\nMade by Links. Strange things happen\nwhen you drink a Links cocktail. You\nhave been warned.\nBarbeque\nCourtesy of the Red Cross. Surely you\ndon't need me to explain what a barbeque is?\nDiscos\nYes, two of these. Loud music and\nflashing lights, they tell me.\nFilms\nAh, some good ones here: Monty\nPython's 'The Meaning of Life' and\n'Last Tango in Paris'. At this point I shall be getting out my mop to clear up\ny eur mess. Spare me a thought, will\nyou?\nAnd finally..You!\nWithout whom they'd be no Carnival at\nall! Yes!

One of\nthe best known figures\naround FELIX, and in fact\nCollege generally, is that of\nNigel 'Paparrazzi' Atkinson.\nHowever the famous big\nNige profile is now on the\nchange. The king of the\nclicking shutters has\nrecently been seen at IC\nKeep Fit. On hearing about\nthis Alan 'Sooty' Rose put\nout a top level command to\nfilm our Nige working out.\nAlas our friends have failed\nin their bid for a revealing\nscoop. What depths these\nmedia people stoop to.\nSTOIC also organised a debate between FELIX\neditor, Hugh Southey and\nICU President, Carl\nBurgess. They hoped a slang ing match between\nthe two would do wonders\nfor their ratings (which\nmake Channel 4 look\npopular). Unfortunately _\nHugh and Carl arranged\nthings before the interview\nwith the result they\nappeared as the best of\nfriends united against the\ncommon enemy over in\nSherfield. Bad luck Al, just\nwhen you had every\ngimmick in the book lined\nup.\nMore balls-ups this time\non behalf of Guilds\nmascot ry. The idea of\nmascot ry is of course to\nsteal things, but our\nNigel 'Slim Jim' Atkinson at\nhis Keep Fit lessons. Sorry\nabout the quality of the\nphotos, Nige wasn't keen to\nbe photographed.\nbungling friends have not\nmanaged this in several\nyears. Their latest attempt\nwas thwarted by a single\ngate keeper. Our intrepid\nband managed easily to\nwhisk the mascot of Barts\nMedical School out of its\nresting place in the bar.\nThis they accomplished by\nmeans of an aerial\nropeway. However, on\nmaking a quick getaway in\ntheir van they found\nthemselves prisoners in a locked Barts quad. The\nwhole event, though, ended\nin the best of spirits with\nBarts opening the bar for a conciliatory drink. After\naffable negotiations it was\nagreed Guilds would put\nthe mascot back and Barts\nand Guilds would each\ndonate 20 pints of blood.\nAnyone wishing to give\nblood should contact\nGuilds.

The crews\nhad a wide range of\nstarting positions and were\nspread from starting 8th to\n321st amongst the 432\ncrews starting the race.\nThe Senior A cox less four which started eighth\nwas racing amongst good\ncompany. The Thames\nTradesmen E4\u2014 and\nOxfords E4+ crews started\nvery close behind them. By\nthe end of the 3 mile\ncourse the IC Crew had\nopened up a small margin\nover both these crews and\nthings seemed good for a possible win. This would\nonly be confirmed once the\nSenior A4\u2014 new entries\nhad finished and result\nestimates could be made.\nThe other Senior A Coxless four starting 50th had a disappointing race\nprobably rating too low to\nachieve a good result. The\nnext IC crew was the\nSenior A cox ed four and by\nthe time they had reached\nthe finishing straight they\nhad passed several crews\nand looked to be going well\nas they picked up for the\nfinish. The next two crews\nthe 'Black Adder' Senior B and Senior A cox less fours,\nboth put together a week\nbefore the race had spirited\nrows. The Women's four\nhad a solid row but racing\namongst mens crews had\nno-one in their division\naround them.\nThe Senior B cox ed four\nwas another of the\nfavoured IC crews to do\nwell. They overtook a large\nnumber of crews as they\nworked their way down the\ncourse 'donkey fashion'.\nThe results which came\nout seven hours after the\nstart time of the race\nrevealed two wins for\nImperial. IC came within a second of winning 3\ndivisions as the Senior B cox ed four came second in\nthat division to a Leander\ncrew.\nThe Senior A4\u2014 finishing\n17th won their division by a second and finished as the\n5th fastest cox less four.\nThe Senior A4+ finishing\n21st won their division and\nwere the third fastest cox ed fours and beating the\ncox edf oars from UL and\nOxford gave added\nsatisfaction.\nGolf\nUAU\nIC\nBadminton\nWednesday\nUAU\nIC\nIC\nIC\nSaturday\nULU League\nMens\nIC\nLad/as\nIC\nTable Tennis\nIC\nIC\nIC\nIC\n5y21 sts92 nds93 rds92 nds03 rds23 rds74 th s6 Golf\nIC 51\n/2 - LSE y2 IC stretched their unbeaten\nrun to three matches, and\nassured themselves a place\nin the national UAU\nknockout. Notable\nperformances from M Cox\nand D Tierney led IC to\nwhat can only be termed a 'thrashing of LSE'. Cox now\nunbeaten for two years in\nUAU matches crushed his\nAmerican opponent in\ntypical style. D Tierney in\nhis 1st year has won all his\nmatches by very large\nmargins. Rumours are that\nhe may well be promoted\nto no 2 in the team in place\nof Dave Lang, who\nalthough deceptively long\noff the tee, did well to half\nhis match. John Gamblin\nhad a return to form with a good win. Dave Jakubovic,\nthe 'powerful post grad', had\nno opposition at all. His\nawesome reputation has\nswept through University\ngolfing circles and he is a real force for IC at the\nbottom end of the team.\nNext week IC face their\ntoughest challenge against\nSurrey\u2014the winner winning\nthe division so good luck\nlads.\nLSE\nLSE^ SEL SERF H St Barts\nIsts 0\n2nds03 rds0 Crown and Man orl sts9 Bethnal Green 7\nCrown and Manor2nds 2\nCity of London3 Sailing\nLast weekend saw the\nintrepid IC team set off on\nanother season of hard-fought, cut and thrust\nbattle.

He was first to\nrig his boat-very\nimpressive-unfortunately\nthat's where it ended. His\nnext trick was to capsize\nhis boat whilst still tied to\nthe jetty, losing his poppy\nand two rudders in the\nprocess.

    "content": "College Secretary grabs Union rooms.\nSmith Strikes\nIC Union will lose control of the\nLounge and the BotanyZoology common room if plans\nproposed by the College\nadministration go ahead. On\nMonday, ICU Council called\nupon President, Carl Burgess to\nact immediately to try and\nprevent the loss of the rooms.\nMr Burgess has written to\nCollege Secretary, John Smith,\nstressing that the proposals do\nnot have Union approval and\nasking that the takeover of the\nUnion Bar be halted until the\ndetails are agreed by Council.\nHe has also written to the\nRector, Professor Ash,\nexplaining the situation in detail\nand asking for a meeting to\ndiscuss the matter.\nThe proposals were revealed\nin a letter from Mr Smith which\nMr Burgess received last Friday.\nMr Smith is aiming to convert\nthe Lounge and the Bot-Zoo\ncommon room into lecture\ntheatres for the Biology\nDepartment. The Lounge would\nstill be available as a club\nmeeting room but not for\nparties and discos.\nOn Monday afternoon Mr\nBurgess attended a prearranged meeting with Mr\nSmith, College Financial\nSecretary, Brian Lloyd-Davies,\nand Assistant Secretary,\nMichael Arthur. Union Deputy\nPresident, Dave Kingston,\nInternal Services Chairman,\nAlan Rose, External Affairs\nOfficer, Grenville Manuel, and\nWelfare Officer, Pete Wilson\nwere also present. The transfer\nof Union rooms, as described in\nMr Smith's letter, was\ndiscussed. The Union officers\nlater expressed their\ndissatisfaction over how Mr\nSmith had presented the plans.\nMr Burgess told FELIX that the\nCollege Secretary was treating\nthe proposals in his letter as\nmatters which had already been\ndecided. Mr Burgess had\nassumed that the letter was a discussion document only.\nUnion Council reacted angrily\nto news of Mr Smith's scheme\nwhen it met on Monday\nevening. A motion proposed by\nAcademic Affairs officer J Martin Taylor and am mended by ex-ICU President Steve\nGoulder was passed without\nopposition. The motion\ninstructs the President to make\nclear to the College authorities\nthat any agreement between\nUnion officers and College\nwhich affects Union\nmanagement and/or finances\ncannot take effect without the\napproval of Council. Mr Burgess\nis also instructed to reject any\nattempt to impose new\narrangements for the control of\nthe Union building, and to\nrequest that the plans for the\ntakeover of the Union bar are\nnot brought before the\nGoverning Body until Council\nhas approved the details.\nThe Council meeting\nlasted for more than\nfour-and-a half hours. Mr\nBurgess withdrew his original\nwritten report after several\nCouncil members had criticised\nit for dealing with trivial matters\nrather than the Union's response to the proposals for\nthe Union building. He then\nreported verbally on his meeting\nwith Mr Smith. He told Council\nthat Mr Smith had said that the\nchanges had already been\nagreed upon at a meeting of the\nRector's policy committee.\nThere had been no formal\nconsultation with the Union\nover the rooms however. SCAB\nchairman Nick Shackley\ncommented that such decisions\nmade complete nonsense of the\ndiscussion between Mr Smith\nand last year's ICU President\nIan Bull. Mr Bull had been given\na verbal agreement that the\nLounge would remain under\nUnion control, but had not\ncontinued back page...\nIt's A Fair Cop\nGuilds Hit Squad have branched out from armed as s as i nations into\ncaped kidnapping. In a daring stunt at midday yesterday, the\nmasked marauders captured PC Andy Nimmons, the local beat\npoliceman and held him for ransom. PC Nimmons was taken to\nGerald Road Police Station by Guilds Vice President Symon Corns,\nbut at this stage the plan backfired. Mr Corns was cautioned by\nSuperintendant Everson and handcuffed. He was then led around\nthe station with a collecting pot and forced to accept money by\neveryone he saw. The total raised was \u00a316.91. Mr Corns increased\nthe total to \u00a317.91 by donating \u00a31 himself before he was released.\nThe money has been donated to Rag.\nFree Friday 15 November No 721\n\n"

    "content": ">BOC\n*)KS\nBilled as Francis King's 'most\nmasterful, comic and moving\nnovel', Voices in an Empty\nRoom merely bored me. The\ncharacters wince through a tedious plot, with few subtle\nshifts, moving from one\npredictable event to another. I was left wondering if King\nwas a misanthropist;\notherwise what could he hope\nto gain from portraying every\nsingle person as sweaty,\nbitchy, bullying, bombastic,\nnosey or just plain\nunpleasant? If I were a ghost\nI don't think I'd ever want to\nsee any of those people\nagain, much less move\nglasses about or knock on\nwalls for them.\nThe central women in the\nstory, searching for signals\nfrom the other world, were\neither wrapped up in their\nown pride, as Sybil and\nLavinia were, or very week\nand pliable victims of life,\nsuch as Audrey and Bridgit. A whole variety of spiritualist\ncon-men are displayed, the\ntwist (if it can be described\nso) being that after the last\nmeeting one of the women, in\nher joy/grief, destroys the\nevidence of a spiritualist\nencounter.\nThe dangers of meddling\nwith the spirit world are\ntouched upon. Apart from the\ncon-men who discreetly\nmilked their victims, those\nparticipating tended to turn\ninwards upon their grief,\nbecoming even more self-centred than human beings\nusually are.\nAt \u00a32.50 this is a total rip-off. There are far cheaper\nways to fall asleep.\nJohn Boorman's noble aim in\nThe Emerald Forest'\n(Leicester Square Theatre),\ndrawing attention to the\ndestruction of the rain forest\nand it's people, is sometimes\nlost in mythological\nramblings and concessions to\npopulist cinema, but is\nnevertheless a very brave\nattempt to tackle a difficult\nsubject.\nPart of the difficulty is\ntrying to convey the concept\nthat there are people who\n'still know what we have\nforgotten' to a cynical cinema\naudience (not to mention\ncritics), and as a result the\nnaive utterances of the\ntribesmen often come closer\nto being amusing than to the\ninnocent profundity intended.\nThe editing also fails to allow\nthe audience to become as\ninvolved and concerned as it\nought to, by frequently\ncutting short the scenes\nbefore fully developing the\nmessage in them.\nThe boy shows equal\nfascination in his civil\nengineering father's dam-building activities as he does\nin the activities of the\nindustrious ants in the forest,\nand it is whilst following\nthese ants that he stumbles\nacross the leader of the\nInvisible People, who takes\npity on the child and rescues\n.him from the Dead World (the\ndeforested world of the\nwhite men, who are known as\nthe Termite People because\nof their destructive habits).\nDuring the ten years that the\nboy, Charley Boorman,\nbecomes a man in the tribe,\nhis father, Poers Boothe,\nspends every spare moment\nsearching for him. Their\nWoman who, married Clark\nGable' which is showing with\n'Letter to Brehzenvnev',\nreviewed below. It is a delightful story set in 30s Dublin telling how when\nGeorge, Bob Hoskins\nwonderful as ever, grows a moustache and, by\ncoincidence, goes to see 'San\nmeeting heralds the\nbeginning of the slow change\nof emphasis from an\nethnographic al observation of\nthe Invisible People to a Saturday afternoon jungle\nstory in which the good\nIndians and good white men\nbeat the bad Indians and bad\nwhites.\nThe portrayal of the Indians\nis sympathetic and never\npatronising and the Chief in\nparticular is a marvellous\ncharacter. Their animistic\nbeliefs and tribal powers are\nconveyed with skill and\nconviction, and the emphasis\non their characters contrast\nwell with the faceless\nbulldozer drivers. But even\nso, the film fails to provoke\nenough response to the final\ninformation that of the 4\nmillion 'Indians that once\ninhabited' the rain forest only\n120000 remain, resulting in an\nentertaining but un moving story.\nIn the same period that it\ncan take to find a son, the\nlast ten years have shown a decline, almost to the point of\nextinction, of the short film. I am therefore happy to be\nable to report if not a revival\nof the genre, then at least one\ngood example of it, 'The\nFrancisco', his wife becomes\nobsessed with the similarity\nbetween George and Blackie,\nthe character played by Clark\nGable. This excites her desire\nfor both George and his\nconversion to Catholicism,\nbut subsequently leads to\nproblems when she is unable\nto distinguish between reality\nand fantasy when she reads\nabout the infidelities of her\nscreen idol. It is wonderfully\nshot in black and white and is\na nice change from the\nadverts before the main film,\neven though it's presence\ndoesn't liberate us from the\nubiquitous Pernod adverts.\nHaving made it through the\nadverts the audience is\nrewarded with the charming\n'Letter to Brehznev', a film in\nthe same vein as 'Gregory's Girl' though a good deal\nearthier.\nTwo Liverpool 's call ites' are\ndetermined to have a good\nnight out to escape their\nmundane week, being\nunemployed in the case of\nElaine, or chicken stuffing, in\nthe case of Teresa. The\nresourceful Teresa, Margi\nClarke (Sister of the writer,\nFrank), steals a wallet from a drunken lecher and the two\ngirls escape into a night club,\nwhere they meet two Russian\nsailors. With the money they\nhave stolen they spend a night in a hotel, where Teresa\ngets her night of passion and\nElaine , Alexandra Pigg,\ndiscovers romance and is\nthen determined to follow her\nman to Russia. This desire\nthen reveals all the anticommunist propaganda of\nfilms like 'Rambo'.\nPeter Firth plays the\nromantic Russian delightfully,\nwhilst his comrade, Alfred\nMolina, whose knowledge of\nEnglish consisted of 'Beatles'\nand 'Liverpool', adds a new\nword to his vocabulary, and a whole new meaning to that\nword, chicken.\nThe script is full of great\none-liners, so much so that I gave up trying to take notes\nafter about a minute, but the\ndirection is not quite so good,\nthere are several moments\nwhere the film becomes very\nsentimental, slow motion\ndancing and surging romantic\nmusic, and twinkling stars,\nand I cringed a bit, but what\nthe hell, it's a lot of fun and I even snivelled a bit at the\nending.\nNDSBANDSBANDSBANDSBANDSBAN\nDS Chronicle of the Black Sword\nis the new al bun rv by ex-seventies psychedelic loonies\nHawkwind, and coincides\nwith a major new tour. Any\nattempt to catalogue the\nband's changes of personnel\nand style would run into\nvolumes, suffice to say that\nex-Hawkwind players number\nover 40 including Lemmy and\nGinger Baker. For the new\nalbum the current line-up,\nincluding new bassist Alan\nDavey, have returned to their\nconnections with SF author\n- v fc Michael Moorcock. The\nalbum is based upon\nMoorcocks 'Elric' books and\nis perhaps an attempt to\nextend the earlier 'Warrior on\nthe Edge of Time' concept\nwith which Moorcock also\ncollaborated. Indeed in the\nfade of the track 'Sleep of a Thousand Tears' there are\ndefinite echoes of 'Kings of\nSpeed'.\nThe Hawks last couple of\nalbums have been\ndisappointing and have\nprompted the release of much\nsemi-bootleg material which\nis little better than rubbish.\nHowever, Alan Davey appears\nto have injected the band\nwith a new power source. The\nlyrics, I must admit, are not\nepic, but the overall sound of\nthe album grows on you with\nlistening. Fairly classic\nHawkwind riffs alternate with\nsynth-based tracks which\nhave a definite hint of\nTangerine Dream. But at the\nsame time the whole lot is\nliberally injected with effects\nand the at ric s which make the\nWind stand out from most\ncontemporary heavy rock\ngroups.\nHawkwind became\nlegendary with their wild and\nspectacular stage shows,\nnotably the 'Space Ritual',\nand despite their ups and\ndowns in the record business\nhave maintained a strong live\nreputation. It will be\ninteresting to see what an\nolder but more mature band\npull out of the hat when they\nvisit Hammersmith Odeon in\nDecember. A must for those\nwho like good, fun, SF based\nnonsense.

    "content": "The existence of magnetic\nmonopoles was first\npredicted by Paul Dirac, as\nlong ago as 1931. Since\nthat time, scientists around\nthe world have been trying\nto experimentally verify the\nexistence of these\nfundamental particles. In\nAugust of this year a team\nof physicists, from Imperial\nCollege, detected a 'candidate mono pole event'\nwith their magnetic\nmono pole detector. This\nrepresents only the second\nsuch event ever recorded.\nBut, there are other effects\nthat can mimic the passage\nof amon opole through the\ndetector, so the group are\ntreating the result with a great deal of caution; in\nfact, because monopoles\nare likely to be very rare,\nthey-feel that it was\nprobably not amon opole, but cannot exclude the\npossibility.\nAround fifty years ago\nmagnetic monopoles,\nwhich can best be\ndescribed as magnetic\n'charge' in many ways\nanal ago us to electric\ncharge, disappeared from\ntheoretical physics,\nbecause they were\nregarded as being\nun physical. Only magnetic\ndipoles or higher\nconfigurations have so far\nbeen found to exist in\nnature. But grand\nunification theories of the\nformation of the universe\npredict that magnetic\nmonopoles may have been\nformed in the first 10-3 6\nseconds after the Big Bang.\nIf any surviving monopoles\ncould be found they would\nprovide direct evidence for\nthese theories, so there is\nnow a great deal of interest\nin the search for these\nparticles. Their existence\nwould also provide the\nsolution to a problem for\nwhich at present there is no\nexplanation \u2014 that is, why\nelectric charges come only\nin multiples of the charge\non the electron. It was Paul\nDirac, one of the most\nintuitive physicists of this\ncentury, who first proposed\nthat this quant is ation of\nelectric charge could be\nunderstood if a few or even\nonly one mono pole existed\nin the universe.\nThe detection of\nmagnetic monopoles raises\na number of problems,\nbecause apart from Dirac's prediction of their\nexistence very little is\nknown about them. It is\nbelieved that they were\ncreated by the Big Bang,\nthat they carry unit charge,\nthat north and south poles\nare equally abundant, and\nNow You See It,\nNow You Don't Last week's New Scientist claimed that the Physics\nDepartment of Imperial College, had for the first time,\nlocated a magnetic mono pole. However, as Debbie Wilkes\nexplains, they are not so sure they really wanted to find\none.\nthat they are more massive\nthan any other particle,\npossibly 10-16 times\nheavier than a proton.\nHowever, it is quite\npossible that no magnetic\nmonopoles have survived\nthe millions of years that\nhave passed since the Big\nBang is thought to have\nhappened. But, an upper\nlimit can be set on the\ndensity of these particles\nthroughout the universe, it\nis because magnetic\nmonopoles would be\naccelerated by galactic\nmagnetic fields, so drawing\nenergy from them. But the\npersistence and known\nlifetime of these fields\nallows an upper limit to be\nset on their occur en ce; which is such that at most\nyou might expect one\nmono plea year to pass\nthrough an area the size of\na football pitch. Because\nthese particles are so rare,\nthe group at Imperial\nCollege might hope to\ndetect one mon ople every\nten thousand years. In fact\ntheir detector was set up as\na negative detector, with\nthe aim of detecting\nnothing over a period of\ntime, so enabling a more\naccurate value to be set on\nthe upper limit of the\noccur en ce of monopoles.\nso, the group are highly\nsuspicious of the 'candidate\nevent', which was recorded\nonly a year after the\ndetector became\noperational, but they have\nbeen unable to pin down\nany other explanation.\nIt was in February 1982\nthat researchers at Stanford\nUniversity recorded a 'candidate mono pole event',\nonly six months after the\nstart of their experiment.\nThe experiment had\ninvolved setting up their\nequipment to passively\nawait the arrival of a cosmic mono pole, which\nwould be able to penetrate\nthe equipment with no\ndifficulty. If the theories are\ncorrect, with a small area\ndetector like the one used\nat Stanford, the chances of\nobserving amon opole in\nsuch a short time are one\nin a million. But, as a result\nof their observation, there\nwas intense activity with\nnew detectors being built\nall around the world,\nincluding the one here at\nImperial College. The\ndesign of these new\ndetectors has been based\non the original used at\nStanford, but they have\nbeen enlarged 100 times,\nand improved to minimise\nthe pos sibi l ty of other\neffects being mistaken for amon opole. Because for\nthree years no other\ncandidate event was seen,\nthe scientific community\ntook the view that the\noriginal Stanford\nobservation was not amon opole. The Imperial College\ndetector makes use of the\nfact that a ring of\nsuperconducting material,\nwith zero electrical\nresistance, is sensitive to\nmagnetic charge, but\ninsensitive to ordinary\nmagnetic dipoles or electric\ncharge; if amon ople passes throught the ring it\nwill cause a current to be\ninduced. The design\neliminates the possibility of\nsome confusing effects\noccur ing by using three\nsuch rings, made of\nniobium/titanium wire\ncooled by liquid helium.\nThese coils are surrounded\nby a superconducting\nsheath which greatly\nreduces any problems that\nresult from the natural\nvariations in the Earth's magnetic fields. One\ndifficulty with the design is\nthat in getting as large an\narea as possible, there is\nonly partial overlap of the\ndetector coils. This means\nthat for a positive event,\nsuch as the recent one\nwhere only one coil was\ntriggered, interpretation\nbecomes much more\ndifficult. Mechanical\nvibration is an unavoidable\nproblem which can induce\ncurrents in the detector\ncoils, but vibration\nmonitors and other sensors\ncan be used to combat this\nproblem.\nA more serious problem\nresults from changes in the\nliquid helium level in the\ncry ost at, but these give rise\nto easily recognisable\neffects and the data can be\ndiscarded. The only\nproblem that they can't account for is magnetic\nflux jumps that may occur\nin the shield from time to\ntime. The material that the\nshield is constructed from\nwas chosen because it is\nbelieved to be very stable\nin this respect.\nAfter the candidate\nmono pole event of August,\nthe group are left not\nknowing if what they\nobserved was a rare\nmon ople, an area flux jump\nin the shield, or the result\nof some other unknown\neffect. In many ways the\ngroup might have been\nhappier if the event had\nnever occurred, because it\nmakes interpretation of\ntheir results much more\ncomplex.\nRCSA Careers Forum on 26th November.\nFor details contact the RCSA Office, room\n303 Sherfield.
