    "content": "album: madonna - something to remember caro ii ne \"So much controversy has swirled around my\ncareer... that very little attention ever gets paid to\nmy music. So... I present to you this collection of\nballads,\" states Madonna on her latest album,\n'Something to Remember'. Excellent, except that\neven her diehard fans probably remember her\nmore for the likes of 'Like a Virgin', 'Into the\nGroove', 'La Isla Bonita' and 'like a Prayer' than for\nthe ballads.\nNevertheless, dais album shows Madonna\ndoing what she does best - singing (not acting!). 'I Want You' as first and last song (a faux pas that\nyou wouldn't expect from Madonna) is a poor\nchoice and sounds more like something from\nBladerunner. Tilings improve with '111 Remember'\ntrying to set the scene for an album of classic\nMadonna: strong vocals over a decidedly '80s keyboard feel, building to the ultimate... 'Live to Tell'.\nIt's puzzling, though, that 'Spanish Eyes' is not\nincluded.\nYou'll See', the new singles, shows i mag in a tion, Hispanic overtones and a will to survive\nthrough the '90s. The other new tracks, however,\nare standard singer-in-nightclub songs which are\ntoo safe to be really interesting.\nWhile 'Something to Remember' would be a good background tape to girl ie nights in or dinner\nparties, mostly all it does is to invoke memories of\nslow dances at school discos back in the '80s.(6) gig: bruce Springsteenthe ghost of torn joad an The title of Springsteen's eleventh album\nacknowledges the character created by John\nSteinbeck. More than half the tracks comprise\njust him and an acoustic guitar with the odd spine\nchilling harmonica thrown in.\nThe album opens with the title track and progresses with various tales of the down to earth\nlives of immigrants. The immigrants in his musical tales range from those crossing the border to\nfind a better life; to that of an ex-convict trying to\nlead a straight life, and even to war veterans trying\nto fit back into society, like his previous albums,\nthis one has a very strong American flavour with\npassing references to 'Nam and life in a rural\ntown.\nWhile this may put a lot of people off, the\nbasic theme about trying to make life worth living\nunder difficult social conditions is some tiring that\nmost of us can relate to in more ways than one.\ngig/interview: dub star mr trout\nI enquired about the Camel lighter that Dubstar's guitarist Steve was using to spark up his Marlboro\nlight: \"Actually, me mum\ndidn't know that I smoked\nuntil I sent off for it. I was off\ntouring so I wasn't at home to\nintercept the mail. Then she\nread I was smoking in Select\nand she got really mad at me.\"\nHo, ho, the excesses of rock\nand roll.\nIf you are to believe the\npopular music press, Dubstar j have a lot going for them.\nTheir debut album\n'Disgraceful' hardly set the\nchart aflame, but it took them\nfrom nothing to magazine\ncovers, and a fair army of fans\nin no time at all: \"We have\nbeen absolutely amazed by\nthe fans' reaction to the tour. WeVe\neach gig than the total that came to our previous\ntour.\"\nSpringsteen's lyrics weave stories around\nhuman nature and rarely leave anything to the lis-ten er's interpretations. Feelings of resentment are\ncaptured in the story of two Vietnam veterans\nwhose paths eventually cross again. His voice carries the songs beautifully, and all with a sincerity\nthat would be laughable coming from most\nsingers.\nAccusations of hypocrisy may be justified in\nview of his constant portrayal of hard working,\nmiddle class lives when he lives anything but a life\nlike that. However, his ability to provide a script is\nbeyond comparison and will always be the\nessence of his music.\nThis is not another 'Born To Run' and most\nlisteners will be put off by the slow moving num-be rs. It is a examination of the human nature and\nhow our basic instincts might survive or change\nunder the most suicidal of conditions. Let his\nvoice be heard and you will be touched.

From there\nthe gig went downhiLl, each\nsong melting into the other. For\na band noted for their diversity,\nthey managed to sound very\n'same y', and approached the\nboundary of boredom.\nLet this not detract from the un arguable quality of their album, but from this evidence,\nDubstar are simply not a live band.\nII A| AI A'?A;A:'= \u2022A A:; AA AAA\nBl: ll S; SiAA A \u00ab A::A^A^?^111;!* AAAAAAA A A \u2022A::::;;;:s:;;:;: i;;N:;.;;: AjAA^\ni if iii M^ Ii:\n-A| AI^U!''> AAA'\\c \u2022\u2022AAA/1\nff tt^^^^ ff^t f'^;i^: \u00a3WSi\niff \\tl tlf AAA AfA \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022iff AilAtA\"f Ai\" AlllAAA-;::\nAA'A AAA A Aft\nWi^M^S^f S Mf \u00a3^i^>& Xfi\nKow this is taking die proverbial\nSS^S^ Ml}fi\n'-ii :='-'\u2022'h ff WW%5| iiA|?|:V:;:/!^ ISA ^A;:1^:'.'; that old Frank Isn't even on it,\nf iii f8ifi fifi iM \u00a3\nand is newly acquired World\n^SMSMi:\n::\n4MM ii fi \u00a3li:if A After that, almost anything\n^Siff^&WiMiifMifiMiM^ti\nll ll ll ll ll l 'IAA- A I AO A A, 'AAIA A; from a land who once ^cac l iff-i^ K^M^ f^ i.'f \u20ac-i'[ fff\nAililAAAAf':\u2022':AA.A1:s fil A3\neA\nback the gladioli ] say.

Sir Ronald Oxburgh,\nRector of Imperial College,\ncalled the cuts 'derisory' and suspected that they would affect\nImperial badly because of the\nheavy slant toward engineering\nand science. The College would\nnot want to affect the quality of\nits degree, and is likely to look to\noverseas fees to make up the d if ference. Top-up fees were criticised as being a highly inefficient\nmeans of raising funds, as so\nmuch has to be 'given back' in\nadministration and scholarships\nfor the less well off.\nhas increased in line with in fla tion, whereas Access Funds, the\ndiscretionary money doled out to\nuniversities for them to give to\nstudents suffering extreme fina-cia l hardship, have been frozen at\n\u00a328 million for all universities.\nThe troubled Student Loans\nCompany has been a target for a sell-off as part of a drive for efficiency. However, the governments preferred method of doing\nthis, getting a commercial bank\nto run the Loans operation, has\ncome unstuck as Midland Bank\nhas announced that it had been\n'unable to define a commer ic ally acceptable framework' for the\nsystem.. The other big clearing\nbanks are still in talks with the\ngovernment but are expected to\nreact similarly.\nThe offices occupy the\nspaces set' reserved for ICU's minibuses, which are now double\nparked behind Linstead Hall.\nPlaces have been set aside for\ndisabled drivers, and disabled\nstudents requiring spaces for\nnext term should still apply to\nthe Union office soon.\nBY THE NEWS TEAM\nFree Rape Alarms\nConcerns have been expressed\nby Matt Crompton, DP(F+S], over the fact that few people are\naware of the availability of free\nrape alarms from the union.\nThe alarms are available\nfrom the union office to any that\nask as part of an ICU initiative to\nreduce rape incidents among stu-dents, especially for those students who live far away from col-leg e. Two sorts of alarms are\navailable from the union office,\nnamely gas-powered and electronic ones. The gas-powered\nalarms are available for free\nwhereas the electronic device\ncosts \u00a33.\nTake up on the offer has\nbeen slow, which has been\nblamed on inadequate publicity.\nHowever, student representatives would encourage students\nto get an alarm if they feel vulnerable, especially Matt, who\nwould like to reclaim the space\nthey are occupying in his office.\nNew Security Chief\nA new Chief Security Officer has\nbeen appointed to look after the\ndaily workings of Security\nOperations.

Mr Weir can be contacted on 48904.\nCatwalk Finals\nAn unusual idea on how to earn\nsome cash over the summer led\nfirst year Andrew Mayes to being\na finalist in a modelling competition run by BBC's Clothes Show\nMagazine. The Chemistry fresher had some photos taken by a friend in the business and sent\nthem to a local agency on the off\nchance of getting a job. Luckily\nfor him, the agency quickly put\nsome work his way, and this\nencouraged him to enter the\ncompetition run by the show.\nSpeaking to Felix, Andrew\nseemed un fazed by the whole\nbusiness, saying he was 'in differ ent to seeing [himself] in print',\nand that it was just an idea he\ntook up to earn some money in\nthe summer vacation. He was\nreluctant to consider modelling\nas a full time occupation, citing\nthe hard work, massive competition and often having to face\nrejection as reasons not to get too\ninvolved just yet. However, he\nsaid having the modelling as a sideline would be useful as living\nin London as a student was so\nexpensive.\nAlthough Andrew didn't walk away with the top prize, a contract with a top London modelling agency, he hasn't been put\noff the business, he now wants to\nconcentrate on building up his\nportfolio of modelling work and\ncompleting his degree before\nmaking any career decisions.\nICU Appoints New\nAdvisor\nAfter an exhaustive two rounds\nof interviewing, ICU have finally\nappointed a new Union Advisor\nto replace Minever Kavlak, who\nresign earlier this term.

The back line was well\norganised despite all but the\nscrum-half playing in unfamiliar\npositions.\nTackling was of a high standard throughout the game, and\nrunning from the forwards most\nimpressive. The only score of the\ngame came from Evans, a superb\nsolo effort, in which she covered\nnearly half the pitch after receiving the ball at fly half.\nThe score would have been\neven more in IC's favour had it\nnot been for some handling\nerrors in vital situations.\nOverall though, a vast\nimprovement on the disaster\nthat was the last game, demonstrating the importance of teamwork and commitment.\nRather Silly Mnemonic RSM seem to be playing some\ngood football these days.

Firstly; there's the name. Okay, so they're from Shepherd's Bush, but you don't get bands who live near\nBrown Willy hill in Cornwall calling themselves...\nwell, you get the picture.\nThen there's the\nmusic. London lads who\nsound like Soundgarden\nreviving the spirit of\nNirvana and then claim \u2022\nthat the only reason for\nthe similarity is because\nKurt loved the Pixies like\nthey do. As if.\nAnd then there's the\nlyrics. We get nonsensical, f/^ pseudo-intellectual statements (\"There's no sex in\nyour violence\" -'Everything Zen') and a contender for the worst\nlyric of all time in 'little\nThings': \"I touch your\nmouth, my willy for food.\" (And I think that\nthat's quite enough willy references, thank you.)\nYet, despite the invective above, I just can't be cynical about Bush. The fact is that they have\nreleased one of the best albums of the year\n('Sixteen Stone'), that the two aforementioned\nsongs with the dod gy lyrics are perhaps the two\nbest singles of the year, that they're flying the flag\nfor British rock music across the water by selling\nover two million copies of their debut LP, that the\nLA2 is tonight packed way past its suffocation\nlimit, and that they put on an excellent live show.\nAs he walks on stage, main man Gavin\nRossdale surveys the lake of already sweaty, main-IH Hfl H ly teenage faces and says,\nTB hall to himself, \"Welcome\nhome.\" The band then\nproceed to play a set that\nveers from the good to the\ngreat, from causing crowd\nI histrionics to crowd hy ste \u2022 ria. The likes of 'Monkey',\n'Swim', and the monstrously an the mic 'Comedown' are played\nI with a confidence and\npositive swagger that\nbefits a band ret air ning to a home that was once barren territory but is now\nI bearing the fruits of adu la tion.\nThey finish with a rocked up cover of REM's 'The One I Love' and manage to get away with it.\nBut then they could have gotten away with just\nabout any di ing tonight. 'Little Things' - don't make me laugh. It's probably only great things\nthat lie in this band's path. Just sort those lyrics\nout, lads.\n- album: aztec camera fr estonia max Oh dear. For some years now, Roddy Frame of\nAztec Camera has been hailed as one of the best\nsongwriters of his generation. He reigned\nsupreme in the Eighties with his jan gly, guitar-rid-den pop. He's been out of the frame rec end y(I know, it s a poor joke, but it is the end of term)\nand on the basis of this album, I'm not surprised.\n'Frestonia' sounds like Aztec Camera, which\nmay well be the problem. It seems that whilst\nwe've all got older and moved on, Roddy is stuck\nin die same place as he was ten years ago. Easy listening it is, good contemporary pop it is not.\nThere are a couple of tracks that pull themselves from the mire, namely the opener 'Sun'\n(and its acoustic version 'Sunset') and 'Method of\nLove' with its late Beatles-type sound.\nUnfortunately, the rest of the tracks are a collection of dreary MOR ballads that glide along inoffensively until, before you know it, the album is\nover and you're left thinking, \"Is that it?\"\nIt's possibly time to tell Aztec Camera (and\ncou ndes s others) that they have to stop churning\nout music based on the same old ideas, and should\nlook forward. This does not appeal to those of us\nwho appreciate a bit of innovation in our music. I would advise you to avoid this album unless you\nhave run out of ideas for a Christmas present for\nyour Aunty. (4)\nalbum: m cal mont& butler the sound of... \u201e\n\u2022nick\nSo, we finally get to hear the combination of the\nawe inspiring axe-wielding genius that is Bernard\nBuder, formerly of Suede, and some blok e who\nused to be in a lousy band called the Thieves and\ncan sing a bit.\n'The Sound of...' gives the boys a little more\nscope for development than the two excellent sin-g les, and yes, part of that sentence was pretentious nonsense. This development is basically the\nwhole of the last two EPs with a few extra tracks\nthrown in and it takes a few listens, I can tell you.\nAfter that it really gets its claws in and holds on.\n'The Right Thing' starts as is if it was pla gia rise d from Suede's 'Dogman Star' and 'Don't Call It Soul' shows that Bernard can play acoustic\nas well. 'Disappointment' is an infectious romp,\nbut 'The Debtor' doesn't quite make the grade.\nI get the impression that sometimes Mr.\nMc\nAlmont and Mr. Buder are playing two different tracks, what with the singing not quite fitting\nin with the sublime guitar playing. But, when the\ntwo do get it right, (witness 'You do', 'Yes' and\n'Tonight'), the plot is most definitely found and\ngiven redemption at the same time.\nSo, wasted talent or Siamese sub lim in it y?? The sound of McAlmont (6). The sound of\nButler (10). The weighted sound of McAlmont\nand Butler (7).\n\n"

Definitely not, Seven is\nabout the seven deadly sins - gluttony, greed,\nsloth, envy, wrath, pride and lust - and a serial\nkiller who makes his mark by murdering\nculprits of these sins. Is he cleansing a society full\nof sins or is he just another madman and a master\nof murder? Seven is frightening and disturbing\nand very hard to forget.\nWhen the first body, a man who had been\nforce fed until his stomach popped, is found, Lt.\nWilliam Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and\nDetective David Mills (Brad Pitt) are teamed up\nand placed on the investigation. Somerset is an\nageing cop on the verge of retiring, and embarks\non his last assignment to break-in his replace-ment, Mills, and to solve these murders.\nSomerset just wants to retire: he has faced the\nfact that one man can't make a difference, but\nhis old instincts tell him that this murder is just\nthe start of something larger. This attitude\nconflicts with Mills style of investigation, as Mills\nis prepared to forsake anything to track down\nthis deranged killer. Somerset is a thinking man\nwho tries to outwit his opponent.\nSeven goes out of its way to shock the audi-en ce; the murders are gruesome and deeply\ndisturbing, to the extent that the film will linger\nin my mind for a few days. Seven was filmed in a way that expressed a feeling of depression and\ndecay in this metropolis, the dark world that\nJohn Doe, the killer, apparently wants to cleanse.\nThe use of the NYPD Blues shaky cam adds to\nthe chase scenes when the officers seem close to\nJohn Doe., and the build up to the discovery of\nanother body. However, as the film murders on,\nSomerset and Mills discover that great planning\nhas gone into these killings and that John Doe is\npure evil.\nThe story line is thoroughly absorbing and\nthe finale maintains the dark, foreboding feel of\nthe film. Both performances from Freeman and\nPitt are excellent. Freeman again plays a veteran\ncharacter with his old ways and wiseman aura,\nwhile Pitt just shows maturity.\nSeven will stir emotions, and in parts your\nstomach too. Well worth checking out.\nSeven is on general release from5 th January199 film: the swan princess \u2122 ho\nThe Swan Princess is an animated film from\nRich Animal Studios which is based on the\nGerman fairy tale Swan Lake.\nThe story begins with King William and\nQueen Uberta arranging meetings every\nsummer between the king's daughter Princess\nOdette and the queen's son Prince Derek (not a great name for a prince it has to be said) in the\nhope that they will fall in love and marry.\nWhen the prince and princess grow up, they\ndo fall in love. Odette wants Derek to marry her\nbecause he loves her for who she is not just\nbecause she's beautiful. Being a typical man,\nDerek cannot express such sentiments to her\neven though he does love her. Disappointed,\nOdette leaves.\nOn the way home from the prince's palace,\nshe is captured by Rothbart (voice supplied by\nJack Palance), an evil sorcerer who wants to take\nover King William's kingdom. He keeps Odette\nprisoner deep in the forests and turns her into a swan. The spell is broken temporarily when\nmoonlight falls on her wings but the only way\nshe can break the spell forever is if she agrees to\nmarry Rothbart or if Derek makes a vow of true\nlove.\nIn the forest, Odette meets and makes\nfriends with a trio of well-voiced and endearing\ncharacters: Jean-Bob (John Cleese), a frog with a French accent; Speed the turtle and Puffin the\ner... puffin.\nThe Swan Princess is a competent imitation\nof the Disney formula. It is peppered with energetic tunes although these are a bit too sua ii lar to\nstick in the mind for long. The animation is\nsmooth and well drawn even if it is not nearly as\nimpressive as the Disney greats.\nThe story has many ingredients to impress\nthe under nines: an evil sorcerer; a handsome\nprince and a beautiful princess. Not only will The\nSwan Princess succeed in keeping children's attention but also, it will entertain the grown-ups\naccompanying them over the holiday period.\n\n"

    "content": "simon baker Well, here we are, the end of the\nterm. Time certainly flies when\nyou're having fun, and also when\nyou're so snowed under with work\nthat you don't have time to keep up\nwith the latest alcoholic offerings in\nSouthside. OK, it isn't quite that\nbad; current favourite in that temple\nto the beer god is Sun Stroke, a truly\nawesome pint. My lords and masters\ntell me that this week's Felix is in the style of\nloaded and this column is no exception. So here\nwe go. Birds, booze, fags, drugs. Ferrunism?\nBunch of arse! Honestly, I'm not taking the piss,\nloaded is brilliant. Take the December issue,\nwhich was lying around che z moi. It's the first\nissue I have read, and I cannot recommend it\nhighly enough. Frank Spencer, an interview with\nBeth, erstwhile Neighbours crumpet, and to top\nit all, some delightful shots of Emma Noble, the\ndrop dead gorgeous babe from Bruce's Price is\nRight. Nice to see you, to see you nice.\nNow I 've had a cold shower, I shall return to\nmore slightly more serious matters, with the\nnews that Rag really cannot organise a piss up in\na brewery. I find it amazing that a beer festival at\na university that, we are told, is solely populated\nby alcoholics, can result in only half the ale being\nsold. Although the situation was undoubtedly\nnot helped by the infamous 'Rag-gate' business\nearlier in the term, the problems that have lead\nto the most pathetic Rag Week in living memory are more fundamental (I wonder how long it\nwill be before they blame the National Lottery).\nIt must be clear to all the Rag Exec that the perception of them by the rest of IC is not a particularly favourable one. People are tired of the\nsame old silly antics trotted out each year that\nare beyond embarrassing, rapidly approaching\npathetic. Rag Mags are produced where shock\ntactics are employed as a substitute for humour\n(admittedly slightly less so this year), displaying\na mentality similar to primary school children\nleaking up rude words in a dictionary. Don't get\nme wrong, I am not suggesting that their motives\nare in any way suspect. Some very worthy causes are supported each year and a lot of money is\nraised. But its methods, which even the RSMU\ncriticised, have resulted in its near total alienation\nfrom the rest of the College to the\ndetriment of the charities they seek\nto help. We aren'ta particularly\nmean-minded lot here, but people\nunderstandably do not have much\ntime for events like the Slave\nAuction. Rag is rather like middle\naged parents dancing at a disco. You\ndearly love them, but just wish they\nwould sit down and stop embarrassing you.\nOne subject that I have been meaning to cover since the start of the term is the\nbehaviour of ConSoc. I would never dream of\nlaying bare my political affiliations, but the more\nastute among you may appreciate that I identify-more closely with them than the Socialist\nWorkers. It is for this reason that I have held\nback a rant about their actions of late. But no\nmore. The childish bickering of Ian Bayley and\nlatterly Geoff Boon is utterly disgraceful.\nConstant jibes about the press coverage, epi tomis ed by Ian Davey in issue 1042, are not only\nin most cases unfounded but highly counter-pro-duct ive, opening the party up to ridicule. Al it de less time spent jamming the letters page of Felix\nwould allow you to promote the party successfully at a crucial time. I fear that the only way\nthat the Press Officer can control these war ing factions is to put them one by one in a room with\na revolver. Even then, one fears that most of the\nbullets would end up lodged in their feet.\nConSoc do not have the monopoly on rope y PR. The letter from Prof New, obviously a graduate of the Bernard Manning Charm School,\nconcerning a request for information on disciplinary procedures is one that I am sure he will\ncome to regret. While everyone would agree\nthat the RCSU can be a tad annoying at times,\nthis was not an example of the way a member of\nthis College's staff should'fce have. Whether Julia\nKnight was acting outside her remit or not, the\n'total misapprehension about discipline at IC' is\nnot hers; halls do have systems of fines in lieu of\nlegal action, as exemplified by Linstead. Minor\ndrugs offences are often dealt with internally,\nrather than by the Police, where a caution would\nbe issued. To sneer at a polite request for information is not becoming of a man in his position,\nand one I suspect he would not suffer gladly\nfrom one of his residents or students.\nSubwardenship in Southwell Hall\nThe deadline for the above position has been extended to Friday 15th December.\nWe are hoping to appoint a postgraduate student who is planning to remain at college for at least\n18 months. The position is available from early January.\nApplication forms are available from the accommodation office and should be\nreturned to Ken Young, Department of Chemistry.\nNB. Southwell is a lively undergraduate Hall, people requiring\nsleep are advised not to apply.\n\n"

FELIX WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 1 3TH1995 NEWS REVIEW\nNews Review: Autumn 1995\nBY ANDY SINHARAY\nFelix 1034: Tripping\nFreshers tripping merrily into\nSouth Ken were accosted with\nthe tale of a stone lion called\n*\u2022 A AA \u00ab\nIS^^^ AS4-IAA^^Ak'Sfe\n'Reggie' tripping back to KCL.\nThe RCSU, having unburdened\nKCL of their mascot last term,\nrepatriated Reggie, though without the traditional charity dona-tion. RCSU president Mo Dulloo\nsaid he wasn't entirely happy\nwith the situation. Not unlike\nSarah White, \"extremely cross\"\nwith the College's minimalist\napproach to discussion on the\nSherfield move. There was a spate of burglaries in Clayponds;\na spate of vandalism in Princes\nGardens (after the security barrier got, well, vandalised), and a spate of building projects everywhere else.\nFelix 1035: Extreme\nFreshers tripping merrily in\nFreshers Fair may also been\naccosted by the non-IC Islamic\ngroup Hizb-ut-Tahrir. The org-an is ation, accused of extremism\nstarted exhibiting outside Beit\nArch without the permission of\nICU, who called the police.\nExtremism of a different kind\nwas reported by Time Out mag-a zine, highlighting IC as having\na drink problem. This was\ndenied (vociferously, of course)\nby Sabbaticals and the ProRector, Alan Swanson, saying\nonly a tiny number of students\nwere affected. And College\nfinally condescended to consult\nICU over the Sherfield move...\nFelix 1036: Bent Over\nOne Fresher tripped maybe too\nmerrily to a Rag event only to end\nup sprawled on the Sherfield\nwalkway, with allegations that\nperhaps offering free spirits to\nstudents wasn't such a good idea.\nDP(F&S) Matt Crompton had\napproved the event, so long as\nRag were aware of licensing rules.\nRichard Willis' actions were said\nto be \"highly commendable\" and\n\"new students were not encouraged to over-indulge\". Was he\nreally responsible? Was Rag failing in its duty to stop students\ngetting drunk? Was Time Out\nreally that far wrong? Meanwhile,\nIC Boat Club was exchanging\nbroadsides with Putney residents,\nwho were concerned that\nextending the boat house would\ndestroy the local area. Sports\nmanager Frank Murray said that\nIC was \"bending over backwards\"\nto meet wishes of the locals.\nDP(C&S) Tim Townend was\nunsympathetic: \"If they live on a river, what do they expect?\"\nFelix 1037: Batterings\nVisits, visits everywhere and lots\nand lots to drink. Princess Anne\ncame to ElecEng to open a lab,\nand Bernard Jenkin MP came to\nvisit the much maligned\nConSoc. Drink: not so much\nbooze but the controversy it was\nstill generating (Are you listen-ing, Time Out?) The once\n\"highly commendable\" Richard\nWillis was accused of \"irresponsible actions\" with speculation\nrife over his disciplinary hearing.\nOne of his supporters planned a motion of no-confidence in\nICU's exec, believing Richard to\nbe experiencing needless batter-in gs from too many people. Not\nunlike the entry barrier on\nWatt's Way, vandalised three\ntimes in as many weeks.\nFelix 1038: Sheffield\nWith Richard appealing over the\ndisciplinary and a spate of bike\nthefts around college, it seemed\nthat ICU may not be moving to\nSherfield after all (or Sheffield as\nthe RCSU would us believe).\nAside from there being a union\nwho were none too fond of the\nidea Estates Director, Ian\nCaldwell, said that \"the costs\nappear to be higher than we feel\ncomfortable with\". Miguel Porta-loo visited ConSoc (according\nto the Labour Club). Portillo's visit passed off with surprisingly\ngood behaviour from both students and speaker.\nFelix 1039: Baffling\nPolice were unexpected invitee s to the Halloween party after fire\nalarms set Linstead and\nSouthside residents rioting during the night. Linstead Bar was\nconsequently shut, baffling\nmany as most of the student\ndrinking supposedly took place\nin Southside. Fire alarms were\nalso giving hall residents\nunpleasant wake-up calls amidst\ncriticisms that they were sub-standard.\nFelix 1040: Escape\nPhysicists fumed over a smoking\nban in their department, with no\nspace allowed for them to light\nup. Hope had however lit up for\nLinstead Bar, with Pro-Rector\nProf Swanson deciding that the\nclosure decision had been a bit\nrash. The RCSU got afflicted\nwith more than the usual deficiencies with the resignation of\ntheir VP and the (thr eae ten ed) loss of their office. A considerably more serious loss occurred\nafter a Rowing Club boat broke in\nhalf during training, though its\ncrew swam to safety: \"We were\nlucky to escape with our lives,\"\nsaid one of the escapees. Maybe,\nbut...\nFelix 1041: Torpedoed\n...thy were to be well and truly\nsunk after no less an eminence as\nDavid Mellor MP torpedoed\ntheir plans for their clubhouse\ndevelopment, with the Borough's planning com mm it tee throwing\nout the scheme. Mellor said he\nwas \"delighted that the balance...\nbetween the interests of the\nlocals is not to be de stabilised.\" Back at ConSoc, John Gummer\nfaced questions on topics from\npollution to privatisation. Petty\ncrime was also in evidence (else-where). The Clayponds Estate\nwas hit by more burglaries, and\nICU was hit by the theft of its\nfront doormat. The Conference\ncentre was hit by impending clo-sure, and Richard Willis was hit\nby defeat, losing his appeal\nagainst disciplinary punishment\nand facing a \u00a375 fine.\nFelix 1042: Witch\nTheft remained a problem, and\nfresher s could now trip in another sense after it emerged that IC\nstudents could now obtain ecstasy with surprising ease. Chris\nSmith MP was merely doing IT\nat LabSoc, talking to the club\nabout the information super-highway. Linstead's now legendary Halloween party saw the\ntribunal (witch-hunt?) of a re-app take place.\nFelix 1043: Bumper\nA bumper crop of thefts continued to rock IC as Olave and\nLinstead Halls were hit. Other\nburglaries included exam candidates of their own calculators\nunder new regulations, and charities of their earnings as as it\nemerged that Rag week hadn't been quite the money spinner it\nwas planned to be. Sarah White\nlooks less cross, though.\n\n"

    "content": "LETTERS & EDITORIAL FELIX WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 1 3 TH1995 NINETEEN I appreciate the difficulty for\nin vigil at or s to check every calculator\nin the examination hall. This, how ev er, is not a justification to void the\nstudents' right to choose a calculator\nto use. I would like to suggest an\nalternative [...]:\nIn Hong Kong, students sitting\nfor open examinations are allowed\nonly to use calculators that carry\napproval stamps issued by the Hong\nKong Education Authority. Prior to\nthe exams, students need to submit\nthe calculators they intend to use to\nthe H KEA, who will examine the calculators and mark the machines with\na stamp. Subsequently only calculators that carry the approval stamp are\nallowed to be used in the exam venue\n[\u2022\u2022\u2022]\nA similar scheme may be implemented in the College. Students\ncould be asked to submit their calculators to either their departments or\nthe Board of Examinors for approval\nchecks; only those machines that\ncomply to the Board's requirement\nwill be given the approval [...]\nI hope this will help the Board\nmaintain a control on what calculators are used in examinations without\nfacing the students with a difficult\nsituation where they have to use\nunfamiliar instruments in crucial\nmoments of their academic assess-ment s. Moreover, this would save the\nCollege a considerable sum of money\non purchasing calculators.\nYours sincerely,\nEric Chan\nChem Eng IV\nRag and bones to\npick\nDear Felix,\nWe would like to correct a few\nfacts that were included in Mark\nBridge's article last week. Firstly, the\nBeer Festival did not make a loss as\nhas been claimed. In fact the event\nmade a small profit despite having a lower attendance than previous years.\nOver \u00a31200 was raised during\nthe rest of Rag Week [...] This has\npushed Rag's total this year to just\nover \u00a34500. The reason that we were\nunable to comment on this figure is\nthat no-one from Felix bothered to\nask!\nSecondly, the Dirty Disco. Rag\nassisted with this event, providing the\nfloat, some of the publicity and making all of the bookings for the Disco.\nWe asked the R SMU on several occasions whether they required any more\nas s it ance, and were assured that no\nmore help was required. We eagerly\nawait a receipt for the proceeds, as\npromised.\n[...] Rag are as strong as ever and\nwill keep doing what we do best \u2014\ncollecting money for the sick, homeless and needy. It is a shame we do\nnot have your support.\nYours sincerely\nJon Lambert, Rag Chair\nMark Harrison, Rag Treasurer\nBollocks did nobody ask how much\nyou'd raised so far \u2014 the reason we\ncouldn't put in a figure was that\nwhen we talked to you, no-one could\ntell us.\nRibbons\nDear Rachel,\nI was very disappointed to see\nthat Felix 1043 on 1st December did\nnot pay more attention to World Aids\nDay. There are, as I'm sure you're\naware, still a lot of myths about HIV and AIDS which your paper could\nhave helped dispel with an article\nabout how HIV is contracted and\nspread, and what can be done to prevent it [...]\nToo many people think of HIV and AIDS as being 'someone else s problem'. It isn't. It will not go away\nif ignored. It is here amongst us. The\nonly way at present to combat it is to\neducate everyone in safer sex practices. Felix provides an ideal medium\nto get the message across to people\nwho aren't going to pick up a safer sex\nleaflet somewhere. I hope, in the not\ntoo distant future, you will publish an\narticle, to which I would be only to\nhappy to contribute.\nYours sincerely,\nNigel Russell MED\nI couldn't agree more, and eagerly\nawait your contribution... though on\nreading your letter one resident Felix\nwag announced that AIDS day isn't relevant to Imperial because no one\nhas sex here.\nNon-dedicated\nReader\nDear Felix,\nI am not a dedicated reader of\nyour \"student newspaper\", but it\noften provides light entertainment of\na Friday morning. I have noticed the\nhigher standard of the content this\nyear over last and have been struck by\na scattering of surprisingly diverse\nand interesting articles. Imagine my\ndismay then to find the majority of\nissue 1042 devoted to an adolescent\nand frankly boring discussion of\ndrugs; ecstasy in particular. For good-ness' sake GROW UP! The articles seemed to make out\nthat IC was some kind of drugs haven\nor opium den. Call me naive if you\nlike (you'd be wrong) but I really cannot believe that IC has a major drugs\nproblem, if indeed any drugs problem\nat all. Where IC's problem lies is in\nthe large proportion of narrow minded fools who seem to think that using\ndrugs is about being 'cool'. Of course\nI'm not saying that this problem is\nexclusive to IC but think about it; if\nyou did a survey asking people what\ntypes of drugs they had tried or regularly used, I think you could be justified in interpreting the results for\ndope use (and similarly for other\ntypes of drug) as follows:\n1) People who have tried dope =\npeople who know someone who has.\n2) People who regularly use dope =\npeople who use it when their broth-er's dod gy mate offers it to them.\n3) People who use it daily = people\nwho buy and use it occasionally.\nOne columnist claimed that he\nhad spoken to an IC dealer. Maybe,\nbut I wouldn't be surprised if this\n'dealer' was just someone who once\nsold some stale weed to a mate. You\nsee, people who use dope and other\ndrugs because they ENJOY them and\nespecially those who sell them don't tend to show off about it and make a song and dance.\nSo come on Felix, please don't bore\nus with such fashion n able discourses\non drug use, especially if it is done in\nsuch an unprofessional way.\nRupert Ingham\nCiv Eng.\nIf a Felix reporter writes about having spoken to a dealer, it is most likely that it is because they have, in fact,\njust spoken to a dealer, and not 'just\nsomeone who once sold some stale\nweed to a mate'. If however you wish\nto delude yourself otherwise then\nfeel free to do so. Our job is merely\nto bring information to you, and if\nyou choose to ignore it and carry on\nspouting your own ill-informed ideas\nthen that is your prerogative. We can\ngive you the facts, but we can't force\nyou to think about them. On another note, your equation 'people who\nhave tried dope = people who know\nsomeone who has' simply implies\nthat people who have tried dope are\npeople who know someone who has;\na foregone conclusion, surely. Thus,\nMr Ingham, you reveal yourself not\nonly to be small minded, arrogant\nand (despite your protestations)\nnaive, but a poor logician as well.\n| Letters may be edited |\nI for length.

    "content": "NEWS FELIX WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 1 3TH1995. FIVE\nRoyal Albert Hall Looks Back to the\nFuture for Science and Arts\nBY BEN WILKINS\nThe Albert Hall, traditionally a venue for opera and pop con-cert s, may be reverting to its original purpose- a centre for the promotion of science and the arts.\nThis March, the RAH will be celebrating its 125th anniversary.\nIn the run up to the celebrations, one of the new initiatives is\nthe setting up of an Arts and\nScience study group. The group\nwill be looking at the hall's main\nobjectives in the first quarter of\nthe 21st century and is currently\ngathering ideas for how the venue\ncould be used to promote sci-en ce. When Prince Albert leased\nthe Kensington site in 1852, his\nplan was to build an institution to\npromote \"Scientific and artistic\nknowledge as applicable to productive industry\". The building\nwas completed in 1871 and for\nthe first few decades, science lectures were very popular, drawing\nup 9000 visitors. In 1933 Albert\nEinstein and Ernest Rutherford\ngave a lecture to raise funds for\nrefugees from Nazi Germany.\nUnfortunately, subsequent to\nEinstein's appearance, there were\nno more science events at the site\nuntil quite recently.\nHowever, it seems public\ninterest in science is on the\nincrease. Last month, at the Hall,\nProfessor Stephen Hawking gave\nhis lecture \"Does God Throw\nDice in Black Holes?\" (see right).\nOver 5000 people came to see\nhim, and outside, touts sold tickets on the pavement.\nHawking's First Words in Jeopardy?\n\"Can you hear me?\" was his\nfirst sentence. Hawking'se lec tronic, metallic sounding voice\nwas made even more unearthly\nby the Royal Albert Hall's echoing acoustics. Hawking himself\nlooked a very diminished figure.\n\"He seemed like he was asleep\nhalf the time\" commented one\nmember of the audience. His talk\nthough, was engaging and enter-tai ning. He discussed determinism,\nsaying he had proved mathematically that it was impossible to\npredict the future perfectly. His\nidea is that there may be millions\nof tiny black holes in the universe\nno bigger than a pin prick. When\na black hole evaporates, the\ninformation about any objects\nwhich may have fallen into it will\nbe irretrievably lost. It follows\nthat it would be impossible to\ncalculate the course of the\nfuture, even if we had all the\ninformation about the present.\nAt the end of the lecture,\nHawking answered ten selected\nquestions, including \"Is time\ntravel possible\". His answer was\n\"Not for objects as large and\ncomplex as humans\", commenting that he would be unhappy if\nit was possible, because then\nsomeone might go back in time\nand kill his parents before he was\nborn.\nGET STUFFED!\nROAST TURKEY\nCHRISTMAS DINNER\nTURKEY \u00a33.25 IB. 75 WITH DESSERT\nVEGETARIAN \u00a33/\u00a33.50\nAVAILABLE WEDS.13 TH& T HURS14T HDEC VEGETARIAN OPT IO NAVAILABLE\np.e.s.( Southwark) Limited\nrom\n100\nPentium P100\n\u00a3595\n\u00a3638\n\u00a3850\nj fc Apple Mac\n|S30 8/500/CD \u00a3800\n5200 8/800/CD \u00a31399\n7200 16/lG b/ CD\u00a31699\nAll prices exclude VAT.\ns nt discount available on\n: models.\nFor all your\nComputing\nServices\nP.C.S.

    "content": "album: u2 and brian eno - -passengers: original soundtracks Lan\nBrian Eno's work has influenced many bands and\nis hugely responsible for the shift in U2's musical\ndirection from a typical guitar based sound to\nsomething with a greater musical depth and variety. This soundtrack is a compilation of music and\nsongs from a wide variety of movies that most of\nus are unlikely to see. A word of warning: the\nmusic here will make little impact without the\nnotes on the respective movies in the CD sleeve.\nThe opening track, 'United Colours', is the\nsetting for a Japanese movie about a man who falls\nasleep and dreams while travelling on a bullet\ntrain. The dream descends into a nightmare and\nthe whole shift of emotions from calmness to\nuneasiness and finally chaos is captured musically.\nBono's voice starts the second track and he\nstill manages to convey the faint image of a man\nreminiscing about a certain event. Pavarotti's voice\nrings out on the poignant 'Miss Sarajevo' from the\ndocumentary of the same name about a beauty\ncontest run under mortar fire.\nAlthough the theme of the song itself may\nsound clich ed, lines like \"...is there a time to be a beauty queen?\" show the dark humour behind\nthe difficult conditions. It also moves the focus\nbelow: U2 in wintry days of yore\naway from the complexity of the problems\ninvolved (hopefully solved) to that of actually living a life under those depressing conditions.\nHowie B and Bono provide some raw energy\non 'Elvis Ate America' which is one the highlights\nof the album. The simple music mix complements the vocals beautifully, giving both singers\nample room to roam about.\nU2 appear individually on the credits because\nthis is not a U2 album. It is Brian Eno's genius that\nis on display here. This is an album to delve into\nonce a while when things become too simplistic\nfor your liking. The music often stays on a different plane but it does invite you in for a visit. (8)\ngig: grant hart,\nArmed with only a guitar, Grant Hart comes on\nwith laconic can dour, oblivious to the almost\nobsessive adulation of some of the crowd here\ntonight. Playing a long set of stark, naked songs he\nreally gets the audience going. In between songs\nhe tugs audaciously on his bottle of whisky and\ntries to break the world record for the number of\npuffs taken from a cigarette. No wonder his\nslightly gravelly and intensely emotional voice is so\ngood - he has obviously lived life.\nThere are some moments of poignant sensitivity. 'Brown Eyes', for example, is captivating ly beautiful. Also acknowledging requests, he plays\n'2541' (no doubt about his ex-band mate Bob\nMould) and 'Admiral of the Sea' to joyous fer v our. From where I'm standing he has an uncanny\nresemblance to Lou Reed (especially with that\nberet) and my mate reckons that his lyrical concerns on one of his songs is similar too.\nThough his current album is a live one, there\nis a rawness lingering in the air tonight that can\nnever be captured on compact disc. It's a shame.\nInterestingly, the CD( Ecce Homo) only came\nabout because after an intra-band disagreement,\nrather than cancelling an advertised Nova Mob\ngig, Grant Hart decided to do an acoustic show.\nIt's a good job he did. He's definitely worth\ngoing to see live.\nalbum: sidi bou said\nentertain*\nI feel kind of lucky. Five hundred copies of this\nlive mini-LP are available by mail order only and\nFelixhas been sent one. Okay, so you've never\nheard of them (unless you remember their\nappearance a couple of years ago at that most hallowed of musical venues, the Ents Lounge), but\nit's a rarity, nonetheless. Who knows, one day it\ncould be worth something...\nSo, is it any good? Well, considering the limited quantities and the fact that it's supposed to\nbe a thank you to the people who have seen them\nlive this year, (i.e. only the most zealous Said-ster s people are going to buy this) that's almost a redundant question.\nStill, for what it's worth, this is an authentic\nride through their live show, as they crash through\nmelodic, punk y numbers ('Buzz'), distinctly lewd\nanthems ('Slitty Gap'), and punning ly titled,\nrhythmic affairs ('Big Yellow Taxidermist'). Sidi\nBou Said may be over-strict adherents to the soft-loud-soft school of lim ted musical creativity but\nthere's an endearing quality to their B52s meets\nBabes in Toyland attitude.\nMaybe the Ents Lounge should get them\nback...

    "content": "film: the shooter poo ky In an attempt to break out of his tough-guy-with-no-brains image Dolph Lundgren stars in this\nlame political European thriller. He plays a US\nFederal Marshal sent to Prague to extradite\nSimone Rosset (Maruschka Detmers), an ex-political assassin, who the CIA believe bumped\noff the Cuban Ambassador to America. Dolph,\nhowever, doesn't think she did it but reluctantly\nagrees to go after her. After several chase\nsequences he manages to catch her and learns\nshe is being set up as the scape-goat for another\nassassination at the Cuban-American summit in\nPrague. Consequently they must dodge both\nsides in an attempt to stop the assassination.\nUnfortunately the film far too quickly\nbecomes formulaic with the final twist being\nobvious from the first few scenes. There was a chance to make a taut European political thriller\nbut instead the film opts for in distinctive action\nsequences. There was the chance for some interesting development of the personality crisis as\nthe Marshal returns to his childhood town, but\nall possibility of this was lost by casting Dolph\nLundgren - the man who makes stone seem\ncharismatic.\nThe film would have benefited from a more\nEuropean style instead of the banal Hollywood\none. Ultimately The Shooter fires blanks and\namounts to not it ing out of the ordinary (the\nAmerican ordinary).\nfilm: dr jekyll and ms hyde\u2122^\nThe ultimate battle of the sexes, or excuse to see\na man in womans' clothing? No, just another\npredictable film jazzed up using special effects.\nDr Richard Jacks just happens to be the great-grandson of the infamous Dr Jekyll, and when he\ninherits his Victorian ancestors notebooks he\nwinds up dabbling in the human genome. In an\nattempt to alter the aggression gene for Dr Jacks\nmetamorphoses instead into a woman.\nRapidly inflating breast, disappearing penis,\nlonger hair and finger nails are the least of Dr\nJacks problems when his alter ego Helen Hyde\ndecides to take over his life and job. However Dr\nJacks life is not what you would call ideal, his\nwork at a perfume company, creating st xm ning smells, is stagnant and he is so consumed by his\nhome experiments that his fiancee Sarah\n(Lysette Anthony) needs little persuasion to\nleave him. Helen, on the other hand, uses her\nsexuality and other natural assets to climb up\nthrough the ranks of the perfume company.\nThis film is predictable, as it is obvious Dr\nJacks is going to change into a woman in a public\nplace at the wrong time and Helen into a man\nwhen she is just about to seduce someone. There\nare some funny moments in the film but that\ngoes for all bad comedies. Everyone knows the\noriginal Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and this spoof\nonly goes down with a pinch of salt, or a pinch of\nsalt, lime and several tequilas.\nIfcAAiA;ft ft; Sftft.ft A A; BtaAii'B: ASi A;1 A> AA?ft A Aft AAA;A!'

    "content": "FOUR . FELIX WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 1 3TH1995 NEWS\nICU Bid For BMS Books\nBY DIPAK G HO SH Imperial College Union hope to\nmove their bookstore to the\nground floor of the library as part\nof the expansion of the South\nKensington campus brought\nabout by the Basic Medical\nSciences building. The space\nvacated by the move will be used\nto expand the selection of stationary sold in the present site.\nPlans for the library include\nadding two more floors on top of\nthe present building and an\nenlargement of the basement for\nstorage. Latest designs for the\nBMS bookstore allocate 224 m2 of floor space, whilst the remaining area will be occupied by the\nentrance to the library and the\nHaldane collection.\nThere are, however, many\ntechnical difficulties with the\nbookstore are yet to be resolved,\nhighlighted by Matt Crompton,\nDeputy President for Finance\nand Services. \"The bidding to\ndecide who runs the bookstore is\nnot yet open. Moreover, the\nCollege has yet to appoint a committee that can consider applications from bidders; the criteria\nfor deciding who runs the bookstore have yet to be finalised.\" It\nis widely thought that potential\nbidders, apart from ICU, are\nlikely to include Blackwells and\nDillons.\nMr Crompton commented\nthat ICU would naturally like to\nrun this bookstore because it will\nbe better run and more accountable to students. Asked to\nexpand on this claim, he said \"at\nthe moment the bookstore committee runs the union bookstore,\nand this has student representatives and sabbaticals on it. If our\nbid for the BMS bookstore is\naccepted then this set-up will\ncontinue to be used. We will\nkeep prices down whereas the\nothers would be run to make\nprofits.\"\nRH Deny Their Ruggery\nBY AAARK BRIDGE\nThe Union's lost welcome mat\n\"miraculously\" turned up at\nRoyal Holloway's Clubs and\nSocieties Officer Shams Sadek's office late last week.\nThe mat was bundled from\nBeit Quad in the small hours of\nThursday November 16th as\nunion stewards were clearing the\nmidweek sports crowd from Da\nVinci's. Many IC clubs had invited their opponents over after\ntheir British Universities' Sports\nAssociation matches with Royal\nHolloway. Security footage clearly shows an unidentified Royal\nHolloway student entering the\nUnion followed subsequently by\na huddle of RH sportsmen carrying one of their drunken compatriots out, with the mat, into a waiting silver minibus.\nSpeaking to Felix, Mr Sadek\nwas in.dally quite genial, how ev er, when questioned about who\nhad actually booked their silver\nminibus on the night it was seen\noutside Beit, he quickly became\nvery hostile and aggressively cut\noff the call with 'Iha v n't got\ntime for this, [and] don't call\nback...' When attempts were\nmade to contact other RH Union\nofficials, Mr Sadek consistently\nintercepted the communications\nand further clarification of his\nrole was not possible, suggesting\nacute embarrassment at Royal\nHolloway Union over the rug\nsnatch.\nSarah White said that she\nand Clubs and Societies\nSabbatical Tim Townend would\nbe travelling to Royal Holloway\nto retrieve the mat within the\nnext few days. 'I don't care\nwhere or how it was found, it's just found' she commented. The\nincident caused Sarah White\nconsiderable embarrassment at\nthe time because she was at the\ngate as the students walked by\nwith the mat.\nSuicides Rise Blamed on Financial Stress\nBY ANDY SINHARAY\nA report published by Liberal\nDemocrat MP Don Foster has\nshown an eightfold increase in\nstudent suicides over the last\ndecade, a period which has seen a doubling of the student pop ul a tion.\nEntitled \"A report on the\nlevel of student stress and suicide\nrates\" it emphasises that it represents \"merely a 'dip' into a very\ncomplex field\" and that it is \"by\nno means an author at ive survey.\"\nHowever the report does show\nthat \"a large number of students\nwho took their own life were,\naccording to the information we\nhave received, scientists\", also\nindicating that since 1993 men\nappeared more likely to take\ntheir own lives than women, with\nmature students being \"especially\nvulnerable\".\nSarah White, ICU president,\ncommented that \"it highlights\nconcern that the recent expansion of student numbers in many\nHE colleges, poly s and 'new' uni-vers i ties, has not been matched\nby an equivalent expansion in student support services.\" She\nadded, \"the main factor is\nundoubtedly financial worries.\"\nICU Welfare Officer, Stephen\nWebb, agreed: \"I also note that\nthe male suicide rate is considerably higher than that for females\namongst students, and that in the\nmale dominated atmosphere of\nIC, men are less likely to seek\ncounselling. There is perhaps a tendency to assume that males\nhave no specific problems.\"\nIC's own student counsellor,\nDon Adlington, emphasised that\nthere was not necessarily a distinct connection between stress,\nbe it academic or financial, and\nsuicide for an individual student.\nAlthough he felt that students\nhad \"a slightly less secure base\nthen there used to be\" financially\nand otherwise, he did feel that\nstatistically there probably was a link \"Suicide is a different phenomenon to depression,\" he said,\n\"there are some students [under\nstress] who would never commit\nsuicide in a hundred years... it\ndepends on personality.\"\nAlthough suicides have\noccurred at Imperial in recent\nyears, he felt that welfare provision at Imperial was adequate,\nand that such incidents could\nwell have been down to a lack of\ncommunication. \"Some do slip\nthrough the net, but I encourage\nstaff to refer students to me.\" He\nfurther added that the system of\npastoral care and personal tutorials operating at the moment was\nfairly successful, and was indeed\nbetter than that offered at other\nestablishments.\nPHOTO: DIANA HA RRSI ON Going Down: Students are working increasingly long hours and face\ngreater academic and financial pressures.\n\n"

College officials were quick to condemn the\nslashing of Universities' budgets,\nwhich could see IC up to \u00a32 million a year poorer, raising the\nspectre of top-up fees for stu-dents.\nKenneth Clarke's budget\nproposals were labelled a case of\n'robbing Peter to pay Paul' by\nangry universities who are bitter\nthat the government has cut hundreds of millions from the Higher\nEducation Funding Council for\nEngland's budget to give \u00a3878\nmillion more to primary and secondary education. It was pointed\nout as being particularly ironic\nthat Gillian Shephard was trumpeting the side wards shift of\nmoney as an advance in education\nfunding.\nThe Committee of ViceChancellors and Principals met\nlast Friday to discuss a response\nto what one vice-chancellor described as \"an act of vandalism\nbereft of any strategic direction\".\nThe fiery meeting refused to\nreceive the speech from the education minister, Eric Forth, and\nthreatened to reduce the number\nof student places and charge fees\nrather than force staff cuts and\ndiminishing quality of education\nfrom out-of-date equipment.\nFaced with massive reductions in capital spending, money\nwhich is earmarked for replacing\nequipment and renovating build-in gs, many institutions are contemplating top-up fees. These\nwould be a levy on students\nentering higher education to pay\nfor their tuition, currently paid\nfor by the tax-payer.

So\nand relax. You are mter inga Blur and Oasis-free zone.\n1. Radiohead - 'The Bends'\nThey turned up in half of the top 5 lists and-earned themselves the prestigious Felix\nalbum of the year award by many a mile.\nSome might say that they now have nothing\nleft to achieve. Then again...\n\"Radiohead's strength lies in their ability to\nlead you unsuspecting ly down a sleepy path\nand then lob in a grenade...\" [Felix 1025)\n2.

A debut\nalbum bulging at the seams with singles, in other\nwords.\n5. Tricky - 'Maxinquaye'\nThe most talented Bristol artist of them all. This isan angry record that, instead of ranting like a spoilt\nbrat, articulates its message with a breadth of\nmusical emotions. 'Hell Waits Round the Corner'\nsounds just like that while 'Black Steel' is a bold\nand brilliant version of the Public Enemy classic.\nAnd anyone who can cover Public Enemy and\ncome away with dignity intact has got to be good.\n\n"

    "content": "EIGHTEEN. FELIX WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 13TH1995 LETTERS\nLetters to Felix:\nEDITED BY MARCUS ALEXANDER\nSex!\nDear Felix,\nHaving read Suzanne\nMcDermott's letter on the 23/11,\nconcerning male/female ratios at IC;\nthe letter concluded by advising the\nIC man to stop working and drinking\nin the bar with the lads. Perhaps what\nMs McDermott fails to grasp is that is\nexactly what most IC men do. I like\ngoing down the bar with mates and 1\nlike women as well. What is it about\nthese two that makes them so incompatible? Perhaps the real question is\nthe amount of attention given to one\nrather than the other. On one hand,\nwhy should I have to join a club or do\nsomething 1 really don't want to, just\nto meet a woman, as Ms McDermott\nadvises. On the other hand it looks\nlike blok es are just stuck with it here\nat IC.\nLeo Rowe\nPhysics MCMXIV\nCar Crashes!\nDear Felix,\nI'm not sure what Ms Wingrove\npossibly hopes to achieve by her constant w hinge ing( Letters, Felix 1043).\nAs a driver given charge of \u00a325,000\nworth of minibus, perhaps a little\nmore care in the first place would have\nbeen prudent; after all, the evidence\ndoes point to the fact that she had\nbeen driving for too long in one stint\nwhen she damaged the bus.\nMs Wingrove's accusations are ill-founded. The damage done to the\nvehicle was more than just a scratch\nand there are several people who can\nvouch for this fact. Her repeated suggestions that we should just have\ntouched up the paintwork are irrational in the extreme and point to false\neconomy. Anyone can see that Where\nthis has been done in the past on some\nof the older minibuses there are now\nrusting holes in the bodywork.\n[...j Most unions have no more\nthan one or two knacker ed minibuses;\nusers of the ICU fleet should recognise\nthe value of the service [...]\nFinally Ms Wingrove must surely\nbe aware that when she hired the\nminibus she signed to accept responsibility for the bus. Had she remembered this she may well have had no\nreason to complain about an accident\nwhich would have been so easily avoided with a little thought.\nYours,\nMatthew Crompton\nDeputy President\n(Finance &! Services)\nAid um ents Dear Felix,\nIn response to your article last\nweek entitled 'Welfare snubbed by\nProf. There is an important issue at\nstake here. A certain union sabbatical\nappears to have a selective memory of\nthe welfare meeting with the ex-union advisor [...] I wanted to produce a leaflet that was not already\navailable in the Union office, specifically about hall matters.\nI went out of my way to obtain\nfirst hand information from the hall\nwardens on the matter of student dis-c ip line. The response I got was poor\nand sarcastic [...] Sarah White, ICU President, was totally unsympathetic\n\u2014 as usual [...] If Prof New's attitude\nis 'just his way', then perhaps it is\ntime he changed it! This appears to be\nthe general attitude of many college\nand union officials these days. It\nappears that they are totally absorbed\nin their sad little political games and\nforget the reason that any of them are\nhere at all, THE STUDENTS. While\nthe majority of the student body\nseem so apathetic to wads union\naffairs, a little less criticism of those\nwho are prepared to take an active\npart might produce a more positive\nrepo nse. Sincerely,\nJulia Knight\n(RCSU Welfare Officer)\nDear Felix,\nThe news item in your 1st December issue headed \"Welfare\nSnubbed by Prof\" may have raised a few eyebrows and may also have\ngiven the wrong impression. I think\nmost students would be surprised by\nthe headline and by the tone of some\nof the comments in the article as they\nwill be aware of the dedication shown\nby Wardens to the cause of student\nwelfare; they devote a large part of\ntheir time and energy to helping students in their halls and to sorting out\ndifficult problems. Geoff New has\nalways been and continues to be, a prime example of this dedication.\n< As regards the comments attributed to myself, your readers would\nnever guess from what was written\nthat I made it very clear to your\nreporter when he telephoned me that\n1 could not comment on a letter I had\nnot seen but that I was sure Geoff\nNew had no intention of hurting any-one's feelings.\nI know that Geoff sent Julia\nKnight a further letter before the\nFelix article appeared giving the information she wanted and Julia also\nreceived a letter from the registrar a few weeks ago giving essentially the\nsame information. But if Julia would\nlike more detail she has an open invitation to discuss it with myself.\nYours sincerely,\nDr Gareth Jones\nCollege Tutor\nDear Rachel,\nAfter reading remarks about\nProfessor New made in Felix 1043, I just want to comment that one would\nbe very hard pressed to find a Professor at IC more dedicated to the\nwelfare and well being of students\nthan Professor New.\n\"It's just his way, he's just like\nthat\"\nJelle Beinen\nMathematics RA\n(Falmouth Keogh sub warden19901993) Correction to last Felix issue:\nRE: Letter from Julia Knight to\nProf Hall\nThe Chairman at Bernard\nSunley should have been referred to\nas Union Representative of the House\n- this stops confusion between the\nwarden - the Chairman of the House\nCommittee, who did not partake in\nany comment on the letter [to Geoff\nNew quoted] in Felix.\nRobert Park\n(BSH union rep)\nApparently Geoff New has written\nto Julia to apologise for the misunderstanding and upset. So maybe\neveryone will be happy ever after.\nFire!\nDear Felix,\nAfter another Friday night fire\nalarm, I'd just like to put a few misconceptions straight. Most importantly \u2014 contrary to many opinions,\nwe do not set the alarms off as a drill\n\u2014 when the alarm goes off, myself\nand the stewards clear the building\nbecause as far as we are concerned\nthere is a potential life threatening\nincident occurring.\nBelieve me, clearing 600 students in various stages of intoxication\nis no fun at the best of times and\nwhen our major concern is your safe-ty, it is definitely made harder by\npeople refusing to leave so they can\nfinish their drinks, or because \"it's just another drill\" [...] So please help\nus, when you hear an alarm, please\nleave the building. If it is not a genuine situation, at least we can readmit\nyou quicker!\n[...] there is no such thing as a false alarm. We'd feel a lot better if\neveryone remembers that.\nCheers,\nMark\nEvents and Marketing Manager\nHomophiles\nDear Felix,\nI would like to offer an important correction to the Welfare supplement in Felix of 1 December 1995.\nThe telephone number for the\nLondon Lesbian and Gay\nSwitchboard is 0171 837 7324. The\nnumber may well be engaged the first\ntime you call, but keep trying with\nthe re dial button. They have all kinds\nof information about places to go,\ngroups to contact and they are also\nthere simply to talk to.\nPeople can contact Imperial\nQueers, the lesbian, gay and bisexual\nsociety here at Imperial College\neither by writing to us care of the\nUnion, or by email to pink-help@doc.ic.ac.uk and there is more\ninformation on http://pink.doc.ic.\nac.uk/IC/\nAshley Lumsden\nPresident IQ\nSmokin'\nDear Felix,\nThe letter published last week\non smoking in the J CR expressed a problem that affects many students\n{Felix 1043). At the moment the J CR does not serve its purpose as a student common room because, despite\nnumerous signs which are clearly visible from every angle, heavy smoking\nis still commonplace [...]\nIt is an established fact that for\nnon-smokers, inhaling smoke-filled\nair is both a nuisance and a major\nhealth hazard, thus making the place\nunusable for these people, who also\nhappen to be the majority of stu-dents. Since the J CR is supposed to\nbe accessible to everyone, the union\nhas a responsibility for ensuring that\nits no-smoking policy is complied\nwith. Those who would like to light\ntheir cigarettes should be asked to do\nso in Davinci's or in the quiet space\nbetween the J CR and SCR.\nYours sincerely,\nY. Hatami EE4\nAdding up\nDear Felix,\nI read with disappointment the\narticle 'Calculator Ban in Exams' on\nFelix 1034. I am deeply disappointed\nthat the College Board of Examiners\nmade the decision without any prior\nnotification to the students of such\ndiscussion, let alone any consultation.\n[...] I cannot imagine how a 'par-it y of treatment' can be achieved if\nstudents are asked to use some col-leg e issued, unfamiliar calculators,\nwhich they may have seen only once\nor twice beforehand, under the critical time and psychological pressure in\nthe end-of-year exam AND achieve\nthe best results.\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS FELIX WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 1 3TH1995. THREE\nMedics Meet Match in Deputy Rector\nBY DIPAK G HO SH Student concerns over the Basic\nMedical Sciences project have\nbeen rejected by the Deputy\nRector, Prof John Archer, as\ngroundless, prompting medical\nstudents to form an action group\nto oppose the current plans. The\nstudent bodies most closely\ninvolved are worried that their\nviews have not been taken seriously and that the planning committee has tried to exclude them\nfrom the decision making\nprocess.\nThe concerns were set out in\nto a document titled 'Student\nConcern Regarding the BMS\nBuilding', which was submitted\nto the Deputy Rector and all the\npotential occupants of the BMS\non 21 November 1995. The student representatives of Imperial\nCollege, St Mary's Hospital\nMedical School and Charing\nCross and Westminster Medical\nSchool all formally backed the\nmove.\nThe document highlights\nparticular problems regarding the\nproposed provisions of \"student\nsocial and recreational facilities\"\n(SRF); from the most recent set\nof plans for the BMS, the space\nfor SRF has been reduced from\n826 m2 to just over 300 m2. This\nsocial space will not be large\nenough to ac coo mmo date the\nnew Imperial College School of\nMedicine (ICSM), estimated to\nbe 1000 new students and 400\nstaff.\nThe Deputy Rector responded to this document on the 29\nNovember in the form of a letter\nto Sarah White, the ICU\nPresident. It says that while the\ntotal number of students that will\njoin us from all the institutions\nwill 'not change dramatically', we\nwill need to utilise all the medical\ncolleges' sites, as well as\nSilwood. He also claims that the\nBMS will have substantial student and recreational space, but\nwarns that 'at South Kensington\nwe have to balance against the\navailable space, the desire to\nestablish first class facilities in\nteaching and research, as well as\nsocial space.'\nThe students' document of\nconcern suggests specific areas\nwhich need to be addressed with\nregard to projected numbers of\nstudent and staff that will occupy\nthe BMS, including the rest au rant, sports, bar and common\nroom areas. The student bodies\nappealed to the Deputy Rector to\nreconsider, and since construction does not start until mid\nFebruary 1996, they reassure him\nthat it is not too late to change\nthe internal compartment alisa tion of the building. The student\nunions pledge their support to\nmaking ICSM 'the best in the\ncountry' but they believe it cannot attract the 'desired calibre of\nstudents as well as academic and\nresearch staff if it does not have\n\"attractive\" SRF.\nThe document claims that\nthey are not aware of plans for\nextending the present library\nfacilities and the proposed expansion of sports facilities. They also\nclaim that the existing bars will\nbe 'unable to cope and would\npotentially represent a fire h az ard' and that a bar within the\nBMS would serve to reduce the\npressure on present facilities,\nespecially with ICU's move to\nthe Sherfield building in doubt.\nThey also seek reassurance for\nthe proposed book shop on the\nground floor of the present\nlibrary.\nIn his reply, Prof Archer\ndetails plans for expansion of\nsports and catering facilities for\nPHOTO: DIANA HARRISON Digging for the future: an army of contractors descended on the site\nof the RCS II building, condemned to demolition to make way for\nthe new Basic Medical Sciences block. They are under the hire of\nSchal International, the company brought in by Imperial College to\noversee the construction of the BMS.\nLast ditch attempts to find a buyer for the antique interior of\nthe lecture theatres, often used as settings in period dramas, have\nbeen unsuccessful. They are now likely to be cleared away with the\nrest of the building in time for construction to start in mid February\nnext year.\nthe whole community, but warns\nthat while the new BMS building\nwill contain social space for student activities, 'it is not intended\nto serve as a major restaurant'.\nThe Deputy Rector goes onto\nreassure Miss White that the stu-dent's views are represented\nthrough 'well established lines of\ncommunication', including the\nHouse and Estates Committee as\nwell as the BMS Planning\nCommittee. He also claims that\nthe ICU gave their support to the\nstrategic sign-off of the plan at\nthe end of the summer.\nMiss White agrees that there\nis good line of communication\nbetween ICU and. the various\ncommittees, but complains that\nthey do not listen to their views.\nShe also said that the House\nCommittee tend to talk more\nabout immediate issues concerning IC but not issues relating to\nthe BMS, because the plans have\nnot yet been finalised. Refuting\nthe part of Professor Archer's reply which stated that ICU had\nsigned the agreement on the\nplans at the end of the summer,\nshe said that it was not signed by\nher, nor was she aware of it being\nsigned on her behalf.\nExpanding on the concerns\nraised in the document Miss\nWhite said that \"there is not even\nenough space for students to discuss issues arising out of a lec-ture.\" She claims that ICU gave\nno full backing for the plan and\nthey have not bothered to ask\nwhat they think. Moreover \"they\n[the medical school planning\ncommittee] seem to have\narranged this sign-off meeting\nwhen none of us could attend\nmaybe because we had objections\nto the plans\".\nHowever, she endorses the\naim of this project and believes\nthat this will undoubtedly be an\n\"outstanding\" medical college,\nbut goes on to warn that if the\nSRF is not reviewed then medics\nmay go to other sites in the BMS,\nso it will not fulfil the aim of integrating students from Imperial\nand the medical colleges.\n\n"

By her\nside was the\ntrough that\nwas once\nused for animal fodder but was\nnow serving as a makeshift cot.\nJoseph walked in and a chill\nswept through the room. He\nlooked at Mary, sitting there\nexpectantly and looking a bit\nfretful, and said, \"Oh, cheer up\nlove, it's Christmas.\"\nUnfortunately, this is how\nmany people feel during the socalled festive season. Whether\nit's due to S.A.D.( Seasonal\nAffective Disorder), the Santa\nClaus-tro phobia caused by\ndroves of people out shopping\nand items in shop windows cry-ing, 'Try me, buy me!\", or just\ndue to the endless re-runs of\nMoonraker and The Great\nEscape on television, we can\nalways find some tiring to moan\nabout.\nOf course, there are many\nof us who take the purely hedonistic approach (and not just at\nChristmas) and eat, drink, be\nmerry and drink some more.\nBut the sad fact is that more\nrelationships break up over\nChristmas and New Year than at\nany other time of the year.\nIntoxication can breed infidelity. It would be\nchurlish to try to make out that Christmas is all\ndoom and gloom but, with all the commercial\nhype, the artificial merriment and the very real\ndepression that is around at this time of year, it\nbegs the question: \"Have we missed the point of\nChristmas?\"\nUndoubtedly, the answer is yes. For the\nmost part this is a conscious decision due to pe o ple's unwillingness to associate themselves with\nwhat they see as a fairy story about a baby being\nbom in a bam. Fact is often difficult to separate\nfrom fable but in this case it is easy to judge in\nfavour of the former. That Jesus was bom and\nlived is not in question because of the historical\nevidence, both from the Bible and other sources.\nIn fact, historians and theologians agree that\nthere is more independent evidence for Jesus' life\nthan for Julius Caesar's invasion of England and\nwouldn't give you the time of day if you suggested otherwise. So, is that the point of Christmas?\nA baby boy called Jesus. So what? How did\nsomething seemingly so insignificant result in\nsomething which is celebrated in hundreds of\nnations across the globe? Well, contrary to popular belief, the marketing man can't take all the\ncredit. The answer lies with who Jesus said he\nwas.\nTo pull no punches, Jesus said that he was\nGod. Moreover, he was killed by the Jews of the\ntime for saying so. He claimed that he come to\nsave people from their sins. Put simply, no\nhuman being, he claimed, was good enough to\nearn themselves a way into heaven by doing\n'good deeds'. Everybody crosses their conscience.\nIf we can't live up to our own moral standards\nhow do we expect to be able to live up to God's? Jesus said that he would die in place of us to pay\nthe penalty for our wrong-doings, on a par with a judge who finds someone guilty of a crime but\nbecause he loves the criminal so much he chooses to serve the jail term himself. But, because he\nwas God he said that he would rise from the\ndead and that we could then have a relationship\nwith him where we would be free from guilt and\nshame and could have \"life to the full\".\nNow, these are pretty staggering claims.\nGiven this, it's hard to understand how anyone\ncan claim that he was just \"a good blok e\". Any\nman who claims to be God is either a liar, a lunatic, a legend or the Lord himself. As C.S. Lewis put it: \"A man who was merely a man and\nsaid the sort of things Jesus said wouldn't be a great moral teacher; he would either be a lunatic\non a level with a man who says he is a poached\negg - or else he would be the devil of hell. You\nmust make your choice. Either this man was and\nis the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse... but don't let's come up with any\npatronising nonsense about his being a great\nhuman teacher. He hasn't left that open to us.\nHe didn't intend to.\"\nAnd so to the point of Christmas. If Jesus\nwas God and he died for us and he rose from the\ndead and God loves us so much that he suffered\nfor us, then that's definitely something worth cel-eb rating. Obviously there were many people\nwho believed this two thousand years ago and\nmany more who believe that today.\nPerhaps most striking is the fact that none of\nJesus' friends believed that he was God and\ndeserted him when he was about to be put to\ndeath. Soon after, those same people, who had\nonce been so fearful for their lives, claimed that\nthey had seen Jesus, and that he was God, and\nthey were eventually put to death for saying so.\nVikrant Bansal\nchristmas: fairy story or presents or God k rant bans a lW insight: unusual christmas gifts,at barb and. lien wilkins W \u2014-\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncolumn: simon baker \u2022\nalbum: madonna - something to remember.\nCaroline\nalbum: bruce Springsteen - the ghost of torn joad\ngig/interview: dub star, \u2122.trout \u00aegig: bush\nalbum: aztec camera - fr estonia max* album: mc\nal mont& butler - the sound of...\nalbum: u2 and brian eno - passengers an \u00ab\u2014\ngig: grant hart\nalbum: sidi bou said - entertain,.vi kl very one reviews: the year's very best albums,\nfilms: the shooter^ & dr jekyll and ms hyde\u2122\nfilms: seven agp e& the swan princess\u2122^,*\n\n"
