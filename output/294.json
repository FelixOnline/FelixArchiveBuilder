Radio Society fu rio sly competing in the\" WorldWide DX\" contest, an amu al event entered by Radio Hams\nand clubs all over the v/or ld. The\nidea was to contact as many stations in different countries? and continents as possible. The contest ran for forty eight hours from lam Saturday to lam Monday,\nthr- club station G5YC being worked by various operators each doing four hour shifts. During the contest about1700 contacts were made in just under100 different countries, ranging from the Virgin Isles to the Science Museum,\ngiving the C luo an estimated one and a half million points slightly down\non last year's total, when the club came fourth in Britain. HARLINGTON FIREWORKS\nThe Nov 5 th Bonfire a tH arlington has been reluctantly cancelled by ACC this year after the College declined to pay for the coaches, contrary to previous years. This would have meant that ACC would have to charge an unrealistic price for the celebration, so they had ho option but to call off the bonfire. Furthermore, The Athletic Grounds Committee had; in its( supposed) wisdom, changed the date of the bonfire to Monday 2ndi ii3o th of these moves have negated the original idea of the H arlington Bonfire, which was to remove students celebrating Nov5 th from the South Kensington area. The College started to pay for the coaches some\nyears ago, to further this aim. Now, Thursday night(ie; tonight) promises to be art he wild one at \u2022IC, both in the bars and in Prince's Gardens.

That hardy perennial of\nIC, Commemoration Day.\nhas now passed by for\nanother year; barely acknowledged by most of the\nCollege, except as a reason\nfor a free afternoon. Yet\neven through the mists of\ntradition, one can see a basic\nneed for the occasion. It is\nsimply a logical extension of\na school's speech day or\nfounder's day \u2014 awards and\nfellowships are distributed\nwith all the generosity of\nChristmas. However it's difficult to see a reason for the\nstrange middle-aged garb\nsince IC is less than 150\nyears old \u2014 a youngster as\nsome universities go.\nGUEST\nSpecial visitor was Mr.\nAndrew Schonfield, who, besides becoming a Fellow,\ngave a speech entitled 'Social\nScience: Its uses and limitations'. In concluding, Mr.\nSchonfield made an interesting and relevant social comment \u2014 quote \u2014\n\"It may be felt by some\nthat it is clear proof of inadequacy that social scientists can only supply aid to\nothers who make decisions,\nand not themselves take\nover the process of decision-making as the technologist\nis able to do. I would suggest that one might go further than this and point to\nthe fact that the application\nof technology within a given\nsystem is in principle capable\nof being programmed\nthrough a computer, whereas\nsocial decisions are not. And\nthat leads me to my favourite\nquote of this year, which\ncomes from a member of\nthis College, Mr. H. Fairbrother. In a letter to the\nTimes, explaining why it is\nthat computers will in certain circumstances produce\nconsistently inferior answers\nto those supplied by a human\nbeing using the same logic,\nhe concluded: 'The reason:\nthe computer is an idiot\nwhen it comes\npitfalls!'\"\nTRAVEL\nto avoiding\n1 hope, this year, more\npeople will know about the\nabove institution before I start writing about it.\nStarted two years ago, its\ngrowth rate has been rapid\n\u2014last year's turnover rose by\nover 200% on the previous\nyear, '.o stand at approximately \u00a31,100.

Hong\nBUREAU\nKong etc. For those latter\ndestinations, especially Australia, it is advisable to approach us as soon as pos-sib le. Information about Skiing holidays and vacation\nemployment overseas is aLo\navailable.\nDid you know that students\ncan now get reduced air and\nrail tickets for travel within\nBritain? Come and find out\nabout it!\nYour friendly travel agent\nis JOHN POWELL( Civ.\nEng. 2) \u2014 you can find him\nat the office in Committee\nroom D( next to J. C.R.) College Block, on Tuesdays and\nThursdays from 1.00 p.m. to\n2.15 p.m., starting on 3rd November, or if you need\nurgent advice, call in on John\nat Linstead 322.\nThe Free in action at Friday's concert\nStephenson Asked To Resign\nAt Elections Union Meeting\nNo one supports South\nAfrica's apartheid policy but\nhow prepared are we to\ndemonstrate opposition? to\nput ourselves out so that\nothers can benefit?\nWe have already condemned tours by racial selected South African sports\nteams and the maintenance\nof any cultural and sporting\nlinks between colleges and\nSouth Africa Where these uphold the apartheid system.\nIt was also agreed to support\nthe Boycott Barclays campaign \u2014 and Barclays are\nworried \u2014 witness their\ncounter campaign. Student\ncustom is important to banks\nfor small students graduate\nto become big savers. The\naim is to put pressure (boy-cots mean publicity) on Barclays Bank to withdraw their\nfinancial backing of the Cabora Bassa.\nWe must be willing to act\nin support of those who have\nto fight and die for their be-lief s,i.e. in Mozambique\nFrelimo; in Rhodesia the\nZimbabwe movements, in\nSouth Africa the ANC. In\nterms of our moral commitment against apartheid, our\noverriding aims should be to\nhelp black action, for it has\nto be recognised that white\nliberalism has failed in South\nAfrica, so that freedom can\nprobably only be achieved\nthrough the liberation move-ment s. These movements require moral and financial\nbacking.\nThe Student Councils of\nthe black colleges of South\nAfrica are deliberately\nstarved of funds by the government \u2014 they are also\nafraid to organise openly \u2014\nways could be investigated\nof assisting these non-white\nuniversity student SRC's, to\nimprove their educational\nfacilities and organisation.\nCould I.C. award scholarships to those students who\nare the victims of oppression\n\u2014 instead of offering scholarships to Europeans only?\nAnti - Apartheid is campaigning to persuade academics against taking up\nposts in South Africa. The\nT.U.C. already has a policy\n(not exactly effective!) of\ndi sua ding British labour\nfrom emigrating to South\nAfrica. Skilled labour, grad-u at es, are required to maintain a large white work\nforce. We could try to discourage people from taking\njobs in South Africa. Advertisements for employment in\nSouth Africa could be prohibited in the Appointments\nBoard. South African products could be banned from\nthe refectories.\nFurthermore, are we to\nexpose the links which exist\nbetween I.C. and South\nAfrica, particularly through\ninvestments, governors who\nhold directorships of South\nAfrican companies, educational and business connections? The historical responsibility for the creation and\ncontinuation of apartheid\nrests with Britain. If the\nAfricans can give their lives,\nsurely we can make sacrifices? The question is not\nshould we do anything \u2014\nbut what we CAN do, as\nstudents, to actively oppose\napartheid.\nThere will be a discussion\non Southern Africa today\n(Thursday) in Mech Eng\n220, where people who know\nthe situation will speak,\nthereby allowing us to discuss what action we can\ntake. This directly involves\nus!\nThe l.C. Union meeting\nof October 27th was reasonably well attended despite\nminimal advertising and a little known agenda.\nThe main business, apart\nfrom the elections, was a motion from George Oubridgc concerning the lack\nof activity of the refectory\ncommittee and calling for the\nresignation of Mr. Stevenson\nas chairman. The motion was\nopposed formally and carried\nwith very little opposition. It\nwas also decided to picket\nthe ante-room of the buttery\nin college block, but this was\nnot carried with such a large\nmajority. Pete Gillet, nervous but determined in the\nface of a hostile audience,\nproposed a motion to send a letter to the home secretary\ndeploring the expulsion of\nRudi Dutchke, the German\nstudent leader who has\nbeen refused permission to\nstudy in England after being accepted by a University\nhere. The motion was in\ndanger of not being discussed\nby the meeting, due to someone proposing that the motion be not put, but the\nresulting vote was unclear\nand the motion was saved\nby Geoff Needham speaking\nup in Mr. Gillcts favour, and\nso the motion was discussed\nand finally partly carried.\nThe elections followed, and\nafter a list of unopposed\ncandidates was read to the\nmeeting, the candidates for\nthe publication board stood\nfor election. Stuart Jackson\nfailed to appear, so Piers\nCorbyn had to propose him\nin his absence, and in the\nfinal ballot Roger Lindsay\nand Ian Carr were elected.\nThe candidates for the post\nof floor rep. on I.C. council\nwere John Darley, Jack\nKalzberg and Pete Lambert,\nall standing for the place\nmade vacant by Andy Osmond who headed the previous year's poll but was unable to take up the post this\nyear. All three candidates\nwere ably proposed, and\nJohn Darley was elected after\nreallocation of Mr. Lambert's vote.\nPiers Corbyn was elected\nas the NUS representative for\nthe External Affairs Committee. The resignation of\nBrian Hains from the position of Acedemic Affairs\nOfficer was then read out,\nwho stated that he could not\nhold this position without a place in hall (it would be his\nfourth). This position is still\nvacant.\n\n"

    "content": "Page 6 FELIX Thursday, November 5, 1970\nCOLCUTT\nI will never cease to be amazed by the number of people\nwho have the nerve to call themselves workers. The latest to\nclaim the title (or so C.E.F. E. says) are students, Arab\nterrorists, and judging by the disgusting display outside\nthe Canadian High Commission on October 25, Kidnappers!\nHow any of these groups qualify as workers is very puzzling.\nThe student claim is based on the fact that the N.U.S. is a trade union and not on any actual work performed. This\nargument cannot be very convincing as other trade unionists\nand real workers have definite views about students, but\nnone of them mention the word worker! In fact no trade\nunion has asked for student support in industrial action and\nare not very interested in the hypothetical views of people\nwho do not actually work for their living.\nIt is probably this rejection by the real workers that has\ncaused the student workers to give their support to causes\nso outrageous that they have little other support in civilized\nsocieties. The title worker has been conferred upon the Arab\nterrorists and hijackers who are seeking to overthrow Israel.\nIf they were the workers they claim to be, why was a great\ninflux of Jewish immigrants needed to turn a piece of desert\ninto a now desirable piece of real estate? Here is obviously\na case where real workers have built a society they want\nand pseudo-workers want to destroy it!\nThe latest moves over South Africa have now reached\nridiculous proportions: rather than take any action to batter\nthe position of coloured people in South Africa or enlighten\nthe white South Africans even to the extent of letting them\nplay against our mixed cricket teams, the action taken is to\nboycott British firms who may or may not have connections\nin S. A. This presumably shows that they are concerned at\nthe situations but do not wish to do anything of a constructive nature. Still if the proposer s of this action boycott all\nthe firms mentioned they will soon have nothing to wear,\nvery little to eat and absolutely no luxury goods.\nBlind sight The Westminster Theatre gives the impression that the\nMoral Re-Armament is rolling in money, and it certainly is.\nAn organization of this sort is not usually expected to possess\nexes sive funds and one immediately gets the suspicion that\nall may not be as it seems. With whom does its sympathies\nlie? \"Up lazy worker and do thy job\" \u2014 could this be what\nthis play really wanted to say? If so, the hint was very\nsubtle. The play and the MR A is intended for all types of\npeople but unfortunately the audience was as usual pseudo-upper middle class.\nHonesty, purity, love and unselfishness are impressed upon\nas valuable virtues; also \"self-improvement is the only viable\nsolution to the world's ills\" was the main theme of the play.\nThe fact, that part of a system cannot view objectively the\nsystem of which it is a part, was hinted upon.\nThe actors performed well, despite the limitations of the\nscript; especially Katherine Page who excellently portrayed\nthe doting mother of an erring son. Innocence and sensitivity\nwere rather well conveyed by Carolyn Courage, a KENSINGTON girl. The doctor, played by Michael Malnick, seemed\nto be the only real character in this rather simple allegory.\nIs it really worth it? Last week International Times or IT as it has become\nknown, celebrated their fourth anniversary with a four\npage spread of news, photos and guff dating from 1966. In\nfact, the paper started in October of that year as a joke\nbut now in 1970 (after various busts and rinds) has never\nlooked stronger.\nIT'S way of reporting news items is callous, blatant and\nbrutal and consequently quite likeable. It often helps to\ntell bad (and good) news in the worst possible way. Note\nthe only comment on the conclusion of the space race in\nJune 1969\u2014'Pigs dump garbage on moon'. The paper is\none of those few 'underground' newspapers which actually\ndoes take the trouble to report underground news. Where in\nthe nationals could you find the headline 'DOPE CRISIS',\nIran Exp. This I.C. Zoological Expedition was unusual in non\nbona fide zoologists among\nits number, and in fact that\ntwo of the four members\nwere drawn from L.S.E. In\nspite of this our aims were\nnot to spread political sub-version, but to study the\nbird life, (feathered of\ncourse), small mammals and\ninsects in the north-eastern\npart of Iran.\nWe left England in mid\nJuly in a new, shining white,\nsomewhat overloaded VW Microbus, and returned in\nlate September in a dirty\nbrown somewhat dented\nVW Microbus (1 careful\nowner, as new? 6 months old,\nonly 19,000 miles!) The\njourney across Europe took\nthree days, and was notable\nfor the bad weather, (we did\nnot discard our pullovers\nuntil 60 miles from the Turkish border), and the number of Mars bars' we con-sum ed. After resting in\nIstanbul, we drove across\nTurkey, stopping overnight\nat Ankara, Samsun, Trabzon\nand Ercurum. We reached\nthe Iranian border on a Friday evening, and were in\nTehran late the following\nday. We spent five rather\nfrustrating days in Tehran,\nwhich in summer is unbearably hot and dusty, while the\nvan was serviced, and we\nobtained our collecting permits from the Ministry of\nGame and Fish.\nGladly leaving the capital\nwe crossed the Elbwz Mountains to the green and humid\nregion bordering the Caspian\nSea, a complete contrast to\nthe endless descent on the\nother side. Our first camp\nwas by the Forest Park of\nSissangan. Unfortunately\nonly three nights after we\narrived we awoke to find all\nour cases, which had been\nin the outer compartment of\nour tent, had been stolen\nwhile we were sleeping. However with a little help from\nthe army, including a Colonel, a Major and a Captain directing operations,\nmost of our gear was dug up\nfrom a beach about a half\na mile from our camp. The\nonly things that were missing\nwere a watch a wallet and a pair of gold pyjamas\n(kinky)!\nWe also acquired a mas-cot, an Edible Dormouse\nwhich was brought to us\ndangling by one leg from the\nhandle bars of a forester's bicycle. Horace, as he was\nnamed, became quite tame,\nbut alas after several weeks\nwe decided to move him to\na more spacious cage which\nproved to be rather less than\n'dormouse proof. So Horace\nreturned to the wild, instead\nof a pickling jar.\nAfter leaving Sissangan\nwe visited the Mohammed\nRezar Shah Memorial Park,\nsome 80 miles east of the\nCaspian. This is a wild mountainous region, with magnificent natural oak forests,\nwhich are the haunt of bear,\ndeer and leopard. On the\nand read how the Mafia snubbed the British dope scene\nbecause it was too loose to be worth taking over. How much\nof the news stories are based on truth is difficult to as cer tain. But it's also relatively unimportant. IT serves the\npurpose of shocking people but not, I'm certain, those who\nread it with any regularity. Yet some people must buy the\npaper for the underground news cum propaganda that it\ncontains. Other people must also read IT because it's quite\na laugh\u2014and doesn't even take its own ideals seriously\u2014\nhere's one of last week's cartoons\u2014\n'All right kid! We know vo u take drugs'.\n'What do you take?'\n'A little acid . . . some hash . . . a bit of grass, some\nspeed . . . a few man dies now an' again, a few beers, a...' 'What were you doing yesterday at 12?'\n'Yesterday? When was yesterday'?\nrocky ledges wild goat, Ibex,\ncan be seen. We also were\ntold that the Caspian Tiger\nstill exists in small numbers\nin this region, although the\nGame Dept. in Tehran are\nsceptical about this.\nWe returned to the Caspian\ncoast, where we spent the\nlast four weeks collecting,\nand studying the bird migration along the Caspian plain,\nin the Goryon Lagoon re-gion. By the time we finished\nwe had caught nearly 500\nbirds, and had observed\nseveral species which were\nunusual in Iran. We had also\namassed a collection of about\n1.000 insects, 100 pickled\nbats (which we collected\nusing a butterfly net in the\nlofts of the local houses),\nand about 50 assorted mice\nand rats, which were also\npickled. (AH of which were\nallowed through Customs\nduty free!)\nThe local people were extremely hospitable and on\nour last evening we were invited to a Moslem engagement party in the local\nvillage, and acted as 'official'\nphotographers. We had an\nextremely happy evening and\nleft well charged with\nVodka.\nThe homeward journey\nwas uneventful, and completed in 10 days, after an\nextremely worthwhile ex-p edition. R.M. Allen (Geol.

Our aim is to spread the Transcendental Meditation\n(T.M. from now on) of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi to every\nindividual in College.\nI hope you're still with me at this point, because T.M. is of direct relevance to your own situation and, indeed, to\nthat of everyone in modern Society. No one needs to be\nremanded of their tensions, their anxieties, frustrations and\nthe resulting depressions, and everyone knows, or at least\nhas heard, of how these things can affect a man's physical\nhealth. How many of today's business men have ulcers, or\nweak hearts? Look at the rising number of people needing\npsychiatric treatment! Anxiety neuroses, psychosomatic dis-eases; these are terms everyone is familiar with. Obviously,\nnot everyone is in such bad shape, but this seems to be the\ntendency of society today. Industrial unrest, high crime rates,\nirritable people, dissatisfied with life.\nCREATIVE IQ\nEnough of the negativity!

Recent physiological studies have shown\nthat T.M. does indeed produce a distinct physiological state\nwhich can be clearly distinguished from the waking, sleeping and dreaming states, and at the same time that this\nstate is one of profound physical as well as mental rest).\n(2) Starting Monday 2nd Nov. we will be holding a series\nof fortnightly informal introductory talks on T.M.67 p.m. Upper Union Lounge.

To make it worse,\nthe lavatories are not cleaned\nfrom Friday morning until\nthe following Monday. The\nBeit Quad, which used to\nbe swept every day, now\ngathers dust unchecked.\nNor is the Union the only\nbuilding affected\u2014the standard of cleanliness throughout the College has deteriorated recently. There can\nbe no doubt that this is\ndirectly attributable to the\ncut-back in cleaners after\nthe Work Study. Despite their\nincreased wages, the cleaners are not happy, as they\nare expected to do an unrealistic amount of work in\nthe time allotted to them by\nthe infamous Study.\nThe question on every-one's mind now is: How long\nbefore the College abandons\nthe Work Study and the\nbuildings can become clean\nagain?\nTransactions in progress\ndays (12 noon \u2014 1 p.m.) or\nFridays (2 \u2014 3), at the college office.\nCOMMENTATOR\nAlternatively, Tom Sutton\nwill be pleased to meet customers at the Station Branch\nat 18 Cromwell Place. First\nyear students who don't already know him may find his\nvoice strangely familiar, for\nhe has broadcast frequently\non rowing \u2014 on BBCTV at\nHenley Royal Regatta and\nfor Radio on the Oxford and\nCambridge Boat Race.'\nAs a member of the Senior Common Room, he followed closely the fortunes of\nThe Imperial College Coxless Four at this year's Henley Regatta, at which Lord\nand Lady Penney were his\nguests \u2014 appropriately on\nLady Penney's birthday.\nLord Penney joined Mr. Sutton in the umpire's launch to\nfollow the I.C. crew in one\nof their heats.\nSomething to applaud this time.

    "content": "Page 4 FELIX Thursday, November 5, 1970\nTHE ARTS\nBOOKS\nGroupie\nIn Jenny Fabians words,\n'If you're a groupie you wear\nfreaky clothes, take a fair\namount of drugs, and go with\nthe boys in the good groups';\nand that is what 'Groupie'\nis all about.\nThe central character is\nKatie, who graduates, via a succession of groups, into a very cool young lady. Her\nmotivations are often the\nlowest, personal advancement and self gratification.\nShe learns to subjugate her\nemotions to the cause of being cool. She drinks tincture,\npops pills, drops acid,\ncatches V.D. and ruthlessly\ndiscards people for whom\nshe no longer has any use.\nYet Katie is not an entirely unsympathetic chara c ter. She is undoubtedly typical of many of her particular\nscene.\n'Groupie' is a stimulating\ninsight into the strange\nworld of pop.\nBeastly\nBeatitudes\nIn \"The Beastly Beatitudes of Balthazar B,\" J.P. Donleavy's latest book,\ngrammar, punctuation and\nin some cases sense are consistently ignored. The writing is lyrical and poetic but\nlike the subconscious mind\ntends to ramble and weave,\nand makes understanding\ndifficult. The hero of the\nbook, Balthazar B himself,\nis shy, rich and loving; and\nperhaps the anti-hero is\nBeefy, his close friend,\nthroughout the book. Beefy\nis a frank and self-pro-claimed sinner as the following passage shows:\u2014\n\" I am looking for sin.\"\n\" Deepest most sordid sin.\nI have been to the latrines.\nBut I am randy again. I have\nother places too. Come. The\ndeepest and most sordid sin\npurifies. I bugger old men. I lay old ladies. Some of them\nare dying when I do it.\"\n\"My pleasures are utterly beautiful Balthazar.\nSacred. I mingle my elegance\nwith their retched ness. This\ncity is a sewer flowing with\nranc our and decomposed\nflesh, rotting through all\nthese streets . . . \"\nIf you like this type of\nwriting, and more of a less\nharsh quality, this book is for\nyou.\nKINETICS The idea of this exhibition is simple. Ten contemporary\nartists were each: given \u00a3100, and an empty room at I.C.A. with which to produce a sitting room. Thus art is expressed,\nnot in a form which addresses itself to the mind alone, but\nin a mode that suggests practicality. This art form is best\ndescribed as environmental art. If you visit this exhibition\nyou will find it a stimulating experience. I have briefly described the rooms Which I found most provoking. They are\nidentified by their creators.\nSimon Haynes. This room is well littered with paintings \u2014\nbold, stirring pictures with Gaugin inspired colour schemes.\nVividly coloured purple fur covers everything which could\npossibly be furred. The purple ' dog-skin ' rug on the floor\nclosely resembles the artist.\nVaughan GrylLs. A cunning inventor of doubtful sanity,\nthis man. The chairs, providing a variation on the his-hers\ntheme, are labelled ' bastard,' ' bastard ess.' They are comfortable but I was the only person using them.\nCarol Joseph. What a magnificent shock on entering this\nroom. Short, bristly black hair covers literally everything.\nWarm prickly chairs merge into the walls and floors. This\nroom is a tactile experience.\nBruce Lacey. The creator's pre di leo tion to chopping things\nin half makes the chairs difficult to use. Unremarkable objects are thrown together to produce a truly wonderful effect,\na room that might have been in constant use for the last\nforty years. Very funny is the old 'mac,' hung behind the\ndoor, with a bra dangling from a pocket (36D for the technically minded). Durex foils littered about the floor remind\nyou of home.\nThe exhibits in the Arts Council's 'Kinetics' exhibition at the Hayward Gallery (until\n22 November) can be roughly divided into two groups: those designed to react in some\nway to the presence of the spectator, and those which simply perform, un influenced by\nexternal conditions. By far the most popular with the visiting public are those in the\nformer group as even the most un knowledgeable can become involved in their operation.\nThese devices vary in complexity, from a large magnetized plate and a supply of iron\nnails for the viewer to throw, to a display of light which mysteriously change their pattern\non reception of any sounds. Much of the in te rest in objects such as these is the behaviour\nof one's fellow observers !\nOf the independently operating group, many are simply extensions of well-known\nstatic forms of art, particularly optical art. Others are virtually laboratory demonstrations, such as Gary RieveschPs 'Lightning rods' which consists simply of a10,000 volt\narc jumping about between sprung-steel rods. Some, however, explore original ideas and\nmanage to stir some emotion in the observer. Notable, in my opinion are Pol Bury's frightening array of imperceptibly-moving wooded balls, and a large wooded wheel by\nHarry Kramer which crawls along, powered by a clockwork motor, until it has to be\nwound up and turned back by a steward: possibly a comment on the futility of technology (?').\nEngineering-minded characters should certainly find this collection more fascinating\nthan the average collection of 17th century French portraits, since even if one is not artistically inspired, some technical knowledge can be gained. All mechanical engineers should\ndefinitely see Jean Tinguely's incredible machines, two of which are on show on the\nbalcony of the gallery. The larger of these, 'Fontaine b5,' has to be shown outside since\nits primary function is to scatter water in all directions. It is enough to give a design\nlecturer nightmares that unlikely machines such as these should even stand up, never\nmind operate ! (It is quite possible that these machines, and some of the other exhibits,\nwill break down before November 22, so don't waste any time).\nElectronics students can marvel at the amazing 'Electronic cube' by Piotr Kowasski.\nThis is a picture of a cube on a cathode-ray screen \u2014 a picture which Changes as the\nobserver moves around between two mesh screens in order to present the same view\nas a real cube would from the same angle and distance. The exhibition costs 3 shillings,\nand includes a free standing-room-only film show of the history of kinetic art.\nCU There\nA group of us, members of the Christian Church invite\nyou to join us, when we meet, as a group each week.\nWe meet every Wednesday, from 12.30 \u2014 1.30 p.m. in\nRoom 311, Physics Building.\nEach week, one of the members of the group leads the\nrest in a discussion, or time of quiet or prayer, or any other\ngroup activity, which is felt to be most appropriate. This part\nof the proceedings will take about half an hour, and sharing our meal together with conversation will occupy tii e rest\nof the time.\nIf you must gat away for sports activities, or some other\nbusiness, then please feel free to do so at about 1.00 p.m. This gives you the chance of gathering together with the rest\nfor at least part of the time.\nSome of you were members of the Christian Community in\ncollege last year through your membership of a Hall or\nStudent House. This year you may be living out in digs or\nelsewhere. This opportunity, each week, is to help you to\nrefresh yourself in the experience of the shared Christian\nworship, to which you have become accustomed.\nHome ?\nMarlene Raybould. Stunning ! ! Black and white the only\ncolours used, every square foot of wall space boasting a painted breast, a gigantic G string slung in one corner, not\nso much a 'bed-sitter' more a 'sex-sitter.' Overheard comment\nin this room 'What a super brothel.'\nHow to get there: I.C.A. is on The Mall near to Admiralty\nArch. The exhibition runs until November 8th. P.S.

Was it fire regulations that worried him, or\nwere there more sinister implications in his researches?\nNobody could blame Mr.S. for feeling agitated \u2014 there\nare many clearly visible \"No\nSmoking\" signs.\nHowever, reports say that\nafter re-lighting one of the\nbutts to examine its sub-stance, his mood radically\nimproved.\n* t** Southside Residents will\nhave noticed a somewhat\n\"out of the ordinary\" bump h sheet slipped under their\ndoors last week.\nFELIX was asked to reprint the sheet, but in view of\nits appearance in Guildsheet\nand a comment thereon in\nBroadsheet, there seems little\npoint in doing so. The subject of the circular is the\nthreat to slam an injunction\nagainst the whole of Southside by the residents of the\nMews. Oddly enough, the\nsheet doesn't exactly say\nwhat S/ S residents are expected to do.\nTHINKS... perhaps it\nwas produced by residents of\nthe mews anyway . . .\nTHINKS.\n# s fc$# Southside residents might\nalso have noticed that their\nHalls are (once again) falling to bits. It hardly seems\nmore than a year since the\nconcrete facing blocks on the\nbuilding were fixed back in\nplace. But already several of\nthese blocks are in a very\ndangerous state, and FELIX knows of at least one room\nwhere the resident can see\nthrough to the outer air underneath his window ledge.**** The number of glasses\nThe Scunthorpe inflatable knees champion, Steve Radcliffe, due to an unfortunate refusal to inflate, was placed\nonly third in the Mr. ICWA stakes last Thursday. Proposed\nby Rick Weightman, his jointed appendages, though admittedly projecting in scintillating ly obscene prot ruber ances, lost\nthe title to those of Pete Earl. Pete's masculine yet tender\ncharms have at last, after many years of career-mongering,\nwon for him this most sought-after of accolades \u2014 this man\nis more than just knees.\nNarrowly beaten into 2nd place was Andy Jackson, whose\nknees were a mated pair, rarely found in it his climate, and\nwhose proposer (Chris Hedley), read to us some of the more\nsalient points of knee history, which he had discovered on a scroll (a bag-scroll!) in i the lower Union loo.\nThe serious candidate, Dave Devlin, was placed equal third\nwhen his boomerang, nuclear fission knees, (purported to be\nable to alter, with their \" get-up-and-go,\" ICWA'S attitude\nof \" lie-down-and come) revealed surface screw-faults under\nmicroscopic exam in tion. missing from the Union Bar\ndue to breakages has now\nrisen to such an extent that\nthe barman, Brendan, has\nhad to station one of his student barmen at the entrance\nto stop people walking out\nwith glasses. Customers Who\nwish to drink outside are requested to use paper cups.\nHowever, while customers\nare waiting for their mates\nto find them pint pots, they\ncan now partake of a quick\nsnack in the form of a pork\npie or a hot steak and kidney\npic. Since Brendan started\nselling the pies, custom has\nboomed at lunch time, and\nthe bar now sells 12 dozen\neach day.\nFt does seem a pity\nthough, that this increased\nturnover due to Brendan\n(\u00a318 profit per week on pies)\nis not reflected by an increase in his wages.

Whether your intention is\nto try and cure these faults or simply evade them, you can\ngain a lot of valuable experience from the University of South\nKensington. The long awaited official handbook of USK\nshould be published tomorrow. It's a well-written comprehensive guide not only to local colleges but to the whole district\nin general. The handbook will be distributed to all the colleges in the area. For more topical news of USK events \u2014\nits hoped USK ents sheet will soon be rolling off the presses\nagain. Meanwhile below, John Goodman writes the first\nhalf of a lengthy article on the theme of USK.\nLast week's editorial did not mean to be a parting shot\nfor a written argument with CEFE. In fact to continue it\nfrom this shore would mean a1000 word article on the economics of regional advertising and the comparative merits of\nmoney and morals When there is a paper to support. Thus\nI quietly resign from the argument and acknowledge\nBROADsheet for revealing the truth (?) about the issue.\nPeople have asked me about copy dates for FELLX \u2014 so\nprinted below for all budding journalists is a FELIX copy\ndate guide.

Copy must be dropped\ninto FELIX box in the union before the following times.\nPhotos are preferred in at the same time but can be delayed\na couple of days except on the Sunday before copy date.\nFEATURES\u2014\nMidnight Saturday\u201412 days before issue date.\nEARLY NEWS, Letters, Whats On\u2014\n2 p.m. Wednesday \u2014 8 days before issue date.\nSPORTS\u2014\nMidnight Wed. \u2014 8 days before issue.\nNEWS \u2014 FRONT AND BACK PAGES\u2014\n2 p.m. Sunday \u2014 4 days before issue date.\nFELICITY\u2014\n2 p.m. Wed. \u2014 1 day before issue date.\nLetters to the Editor\nMegalomania Barclays ICCU\nDear Ed,\nOnce upon a time (about\ntwo years ago when I first\narrived at these hallowed\nhalls), there were the goodies\nsitting down at one side of\nthe council table and the\nbaddies on the other, and in\na comrade ly, back slapping way they hated each o it her. There were a few idiots on\nboth sides and in both backing groups, but there were\nalways a few who seemed\nreasonably sensible and had\na vague idea of what they\nwere trying to do, and sometimes they managed to do it.\nThings seemed to start going\nawry last year when the left\nrose to grasp power and had\na hazy idea how to use it;\na lot was done but there\nseemed a clear division between those who were honest\nadvocates of socialist policies\nand those who dressed themselves as socialists but\nwanted their own way and\ndidn't care if the methods\nthey used or considered using\nto this purpose were methods\nmore usually ascribed to the\nfar right of the political\nspectrum.\nHaving called myself a socialist since the dim mists\nof memory, I now feel that\nsomething has gone seriously\nwrong with the state of the\nleft at I.C. It was moderately\nfunny last year when Mike\nMuller and cef e started\nrumours that the BoSt met\nevery full moon to worship\nthe Egyptian Sun God, and\nthat Lord Penney was two\ndruids in a skin, as there\nwere still plenty of sensible\nelements around to stop the\nleft collapsing into puerility.\nThe sensible elements are\nquieter this year, and a lot\nof \"left\" opinion in cef e and\nelsewhere seems to come\nfrom those who don't take\ntime to consider their propositions and put forward\ntheir views in a manner best\nsuited to a megalomaniac\nschool kid. You cannot\ncriticise the left without\nbeing labelled a fascist and\na racialist; if you are identified with IC socialism you\nare burdened with their\nnaivet e. Can we have a return to\nsanity?\nYours,\nIAN CARR. Sir,\nI feel CEF E is perfectly\njustified in criticizing you for\naccepting advertising copy\nfrom Barclays Bank.\nObviously any sane person must be horrified by\nBarclays' involvement, financial and, dare I say it,\nspiritual, in the oppression\nof coloured people. It is for\nthis reason that students\nmust take a stand against\nthis organisation.\nHowever, the demise of\n'Felix' due to lack of advertising finance would be a sad event indeed. With this\nin mind I suggested 'Felix'\ncontinues to accept Barclays' money, whilst making\nit absolutely clear how much\nit abhors Barclays' involvement in Southern Africa.\nFinally a grain of comfort\nfor Soc Soccers. Fidel Castro,\nin his struggle for Cuba, was\nperfectly happy to receive\nmoney from Mexican Millionaires. If he was prepared\nto. sell his soul for lucre, how\nmuch less Felix.\nYours conceited ly, MARK LANE Physics I and the\nSouth Kensington University reply\nNew students will be excused for not having heard of\nU.S.K.; older students may also not have heard of it, but\nshould not be excused. The idea first appeared about two\nyears ago from a group of brains which included those of\nPiers Corbyn, Dave Wield, another John Goodman, and\nmany other people less well known and mostly now de-parted. All this happened more or less simultaneously with\na resurgence in the National Union of Students as a relevant\nbody and with the growth of the \"student movement\" as a significant part of the British Political scene. L.S.E. were\nhaving sit-ins, Hornsey and Guildford schools of Art were\nrent by conflict, the \"student identity\" spread to the country\nfrom the USA. What then more natural than for some form\nof co-operation between the highly diverse group of institutions of higher education around here? Such co-operation\nbegan on a highly informal basis, in a social context and\nalso in, for example, the production of the first U.S.K. map,\nwhich made its bow in November 1968. Of course, like all\nworthwhile movements, U.S.K. had to be bureaucrat is ed and\non 19th February this year (apparently) the U.S.K. committee met for the first time.\nThis rather loosely jointed structure got things done.\nThe sports centre flung open its hallowed portals to all the\nU.S.K. and the principle of reciprocal use of facilities was\nestablished; another U.S.K. map appeared; the ents sheet\ngrooved into existence; the West London Students Accommodation bureau limped into existence; a U.S.K. Revue\nwas staged; some courses were arranged (see associated\nStudies programme); the first U.S.K. handbook will be\npublished on November 6th,20,000U.S. K. cards are being\nprinted and will soon be distributed \u2014 Not a bad sj tart. Now, dear passive readers, is the time to leave onlookers\nbreathless with the dynamism of this organisation as it leads\nus all into the 1980's. The U.S.K. will, in the space of a few days, be an official N.U.S. area. This pail of N.U.S. activities is one of the fastest developing of its many facets.\nA good thing too, N.U.S. has, to an ordinary student seemed\na top heavy institution in the past. The suggestion of dis-affiliation from N.U.S. is always accompanied by the cry\n\"What the Hell does it do for me, it's just a quick leg-up\nto the ambitious career politician\". Quite right, and if you\nwere lamely to point to the Service section (ie. Travel) the\ndissenter would simply explain that these services could be\nprovided by alternative organisations and methods.\nIt is through Areas that N.U.S. can be made to seem\nrelevant to most of its members. Be it in the field of\n\"political\" action and debate, or in social matters, or in\nservices to students, the Area makes sense.\nA group of colleges, in which everybody can get to know\neverybody else, where the best use can be made of facilities,\nfinance and expertise, and where contact is easy and cheap,\nis clearly a GOOD THING. At the same time many people\nhave pointed out that it is a bad thing to create an organisation and then find a use for it. Better to come together on\nan ad hoc basis over specific issues and problems and then dis-band. I do not agree, for the reasons above, and also because there are surely always problems and matters of common interest. Indeed there are many occasions when these\nonly become apparent when people get together to compare\nideas, experience, personalities and frustrations.\nLet us examine these problems with U.S.K., and divide\nthe list of 'things to be done' into four categories: social,\nservices, academic and political.\nFirst, the social scene, perhaps the most relevant at the\nmoment to the general population of U.S.K. The Ents Sheet,\ninaugurated last year, is continuing and, with luck, will be\neven better this year (especially in its distribution). Then\nthere will be the development of the idea of liaison and cooperation between social secretaries. The U.S.K. Chairman\n(Dave Kay, president of Q.E. C.) is organising a meeting of\nsocial sees. By this it is hoped to eliminate clashing dates,\nestablish decent channels of communication (posters, news-sheets, etc.) and also, dare we hope, start some joint ventures.\nCarnival is another obvious candidate for co-operation.\nIn fact some progress has already been made; M.A., I.F. and the R.C.A. are all joining in with I.C.'s fund raising\nefforts this year, but wouldn't it be an excellent idea to work\ntowards one massive U.S.K. Carnival. We could really make\nthe area sit up and take notice.\nSport isn't one of my specialities, but it strikes me that\nthe sports buffs could get together, to establish clubs for\nminority sports, to play against each other and to make the\nbest use of facilities (and training?). Actually, great strides\nwere made last year in reciprocal use of facilities: you can\nuse squash, tennis and fives courts in any of the U.S.K. col-leg es. Also in this sphere are the numerous 'social clubs'. As I have said in the handbook, it is not for the U.S.K.

There are still\ndenominational groups and\nthere is also a rather\nseparatist Christian Union'.\nWe would like to stress\nthe fact that there are denominational groups in I.C. and it is only fair to say that\nthe Anglican chaplaincy,\npens to be the largest of these\ndenominational groups.\nWe are pleased that the\nAnglican chaplaincy welcomes any Christian into its\ngroups but other denominational groups do so as well.\nThe fact that the Anglican\nchaplaincy represents the\nlargest number of students in\nI.C. does not give it the right\nto call itself THE chaplaincy.\nIt is a weak, ecumenical\nchurch, which begins by\nignoring other denominational groups rather than\ncoming to terms with them.\nYours faithfully,\nJOHN CARTER President Cath Soc\nDAVE GOODALL President CU JANE JEFFERIES Baptist Soc Rep\nKERRY LAWSON Meth Soc\nThe Editor reserves the right\nto condense any letter for space\nreasons.\nIf you fly\nscheduled\nairlines\nyou're crazy.\nOr rich.\nJet London to Dublin f6t q Paris \u00a35.25 to Basel f9 Get FREE details today.\nAt these prices,\nyou can't afford not\nto go somewhere.\nS s tO' BRITISH STUDENT TRAVEL CENTRE231 Tottenham Court Road, London W1 E42Z Telephone: 01-637 1241\n******************************************\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF\nIMPERIAL UNION COLLEGE\nEditor: Anthony John Sims\nAssistant Editor: Mike Yates\nAll the other Assistant Editors:\nColin Harvey, Dave Sugden,\nTyping: (See Assistant Editors)\nPhotos: Malcolm Bailey, Steve Heap, Pete Johnson,\nKevin Beat, Dave Mansfield.\nCirculation: Pete Morgans, Arnold Darby\nSports: Mike Adams\nBusiness: Ian Quarrinton\nAnd grateful thanks to: Susan Parry, Tom Jaffray,\nTony Kirkham, Roger Lindsay, John Ackers, Kitty\nMcVey, Piers Corbyn, Judith Walker, Colcutt, John\nGoodman, Mark Lane, Charlie Holme.

Like the Tories, with their museum entrance fees,\nthey put money and autocracy before culture and consult a tion. Hence they unilaterally decided, against the wishes of a great many people, to put a waitress-service refectory rather\nthan an art gallery there, and refuse to budge\nTheir attitude is a reflection of the attitude of members of\nthe Governing Body \u2014 who make appointments, or appoint\nthose who do. Most of them each have a handfull of directorships of companies or groups of companies. For example,\nLord Sherfield (Chairman), Lord Penney (Rector) and Sir\nEdward Playfair hold about a dozen such directorships between them, which together involve probably over 1000\nsubsidiary companies, many of which are South African\n(where money comes before life, not to mention culture).\nThe influence of our Governing Body of Wanker Bankers\nreflects in the research finance of I.C.(19% industrial,\n9% military), and the hierarchical, autocratic, narrow and\nunimaginative ethos they exude into the structure of Imperial\nCollege.\nThe Union has proposed a change in the College Charter\nto make I.C. more socially responsible. But that is not\nenough, just as we have to fight to get culture put before\nmoney with our picket line, we have to fight for the introduction of socially and politically relevant courses and projects.\nIt is therefore very good that there was such huge support\n(at the first U. G.M. this term) for the very important Union\ndecision to draw up, in conjunction with experience else-where, our own courses and projects to be introduced in\ndepartments (not reported in Felix). It will be interesting to\nsee how many academics, few of whom deny the need for a' broader outlook,' will support us.\nThe Departmental reps and Academic Affairs Officers are\nnow gathering ideas on courses and projects which can fit\ninto each Department. In Aero people are thinking of Concorde cost and bangs; In Chem Eng, pollution; in Mech Eng\nand Physics, The Third World Society is thinking up ideas to\nhelp intermediate technology (technology for the Third\nWorld). They all need help, so bring forward your ideas, to\nthem, or anyone on the Academic Affairs Committee.\nSo don't forget \u2014 you can understand this place if you\nlook ' upstairs' a bit and see the forces which push us around.\nPiers Corbyn.\nCONCERT ANIA I.C. Ents have already become pissed off with their\nfellow inmates after the Free\nconcert in the Great Hall, a week last Friday. Despite\nFree's fame, a top supporting group and good advert is ing, only about 600 people\nturned up to this gig, resulting in a \u00a3250 loss. One estimate was that there were\nmore people both from MA and IF than from IC.\nThe concert itself went\nvery well, the Great Hall\nlooking quite full, consider-ing. Mighty Baby played\nsuperbly but there was some\ndoubt whether the light\nshow was following the\ngroup or the group playing\nto the light show; not that it\nmattered. Their performance was equalled by Free\nwith their sheer professionalism and loud music; People\ncame away awed by their\nact which made their records\nseem so inadequate.\nThe reputation of the\nGreat Hall is growing rapid-ly, with Donovan giving a two hour concert on November 10 (tickets 25/- from the\nUnion Cloakroom), Traffic\non January 27 and Elton\nJohn on February 24. Other\ngroups wishing to give concerts are Crosby, Stills, Nash\nand Young (doubtful due to\ndates clashing), Emerson,\nLake and Palmer (in the\nspring), and the Who rang\nup last week saying they too\nwould like to play in our\nGreat Hall! To prevent similar losses\nEnts would like to hear from\nanyone on their views (via\nFELIX) on who they would\nlike to see in concert, for\nEnts exist primarily for you!\nRumblings\nfrom\nU.L. U. Students entering the hallowed precincts of UL U( that\nplace in Malet Street) in the\nlast few days will have seen\na notice announcing drastic\nchanges in the admittedly\nodd opening hours. And this\nchange is provoking quite a controversy, as it seems that\nthe decision on i the changes\nwere taken without the say so of any of the UL U commit-tees.\nThe first steps in this furor\nwas taken by the Sooieties'\nCouncil, the body which\nruns all the social and recreational clubs at UL U. This\nbody has called an emergency Assembly of Councils\nmeeting \u2014 the nearest thing\nUL U has to a Union General\nMeeting. What this will achieve is not entirely certain \u2014\nwhat is certain is that it will\nhave to take place before\nmid-November. Meanwhile,\nrumours grow apace as to\nwhom will end up carrying\nthe can for this bit of student\nunrest.\nLETTER TO THE EDITOR\nBookshop hits at Neasden\nDear Sir,\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter in reply to one from Mr. Arnold Neasden in your\nlast issue. 1 have contacted the Records Department of the Registry, and they cannot\nconfirm that there is a student Of that name at the College.\nYours faithfully,\nJ. L. Knill.\nDear Sir,\nThe letter in your last issue from Mr. Arnold Neasden (\" Unrepeatable Bargain Offers \") requires a reply since much of what he wrote was either misleading or simply in-corre ot. The Imperial College Bookshop is owned by the College Unions . . . in other words\nthe representatives of the student body . . . and five of the seven members on the Committee are elected student representatives. The shop makes no \" profits\" as such but,\nafter retention of a proportion for continuation of the Bookshop's operations, the surplus at the end of each financial year is paid to the Unions. The method of disbursement between the Unions is determined by the LC. Union Council and confirmed by\nthe Bookshop Committee. As I understand the position, the student body could not receive a\" larger share of the profits \" than they receive at present. The author of ' News\nin Brief was well-informed as to the then\u2014confidential information in my files when he\ndrew attention to the \"fantastically increased I.C. Bookshop profits\" and the manner in\nwhich this could influence Constituent College finances. I am sorry to tell Mr. Neasden\nth a it the surplus this year is larger than ever before and well over twice that paid to the\nUnions last year.\nMr. Neasden has. apparently unwittingly, made a serious charge against local bookshops in that he implied that new books can be purchased from them at prices less than\nthose current in the I.C. Bookshop. There is a Net Book Agreement on sales of new books\nand unless a bookseller agrees to stand by this he will lose his licence and therefore Publishers will not supply further stock. The price of the same book in the I.C. Bookshop\nand another copy bought elsewhere must be the same. The I.C. Bookshop does not sell at\nprices above those indicated under the terms of the Net Book Agreement. If Mr. Neasden.\nor any other student, can substantiate his claim in writing Ito me, I will investigate the\nmatter and report my findings to you, Mr. Editor.\nThe \" supermarket image\" deplored by Mr. Neasden was purely temporary as a visit to the shop will readily demonstrate. Part of the shop was operated on a\" help\nyourself\" basis for the first fortnight of the Autumn Term in order to speed up sales\nand services as much as possible, during the period when the shop is heavily stocked and\nseriously understaffed. The same policy was adopted last year; we are quite unrepentant\nand intend to repeat this arrangement in October 1971.\nMay I remind all Felix readers that there are three channels of direct communication for constructive comment or genuine enquiry into the Bookshop's operations . . .\nthe student representatives on the I.C. Bookshop Committee, the Manager (Miss M. Basden) or myself.\nJ. L. Knill,\nChairman, I.C. Bookshop Committee.\n(Unfortunately this letter was received too late for inclusion on the letters page\u2014Editor)\nUnion Regains Colour A new colour television set is at last about to be installed\nin the Union Reading Room (first floor) to replace the T.V. stolen last year.\nBy the time you read this, the Anti-theft frame should\nhave been made and bolted into position, and the T.V. will\nbe bought as soon as possible, pending Insurance Company\napproval of the frame. The set ordered is a25 in. floor\nstanding Baird model similar to the T.V. already in the\nSouthside Senior Common Room, and will cost the Union\nnigh on \u00a3100 per year.\nNow the Union inhabitants can once again watch in\ncolour pressure is mounting on the Union (also once again)\nto hire a colour T.V. for Southside Lounge. Three Halls\n(Tizard. Falmouth, and Linstead) are known to want their\nown colour \" boxes.\" but are unwilling to got their's before\nSouthside. for fear of their own lounges being invaded, as has\nhappened in Weeks Hall.\nDonovan, shown below as he appeared on his last visit\nis returning to LC. on Tuesday, 10th November.\nEng. Soc. visit to Rolls-Royce\nRolls-Royce, motor car division, Crewe, had the honour\nof a visit by 7 members of City and Guilds Engineering Society of which every C&G student is a member, on Wednesday.\nOct. 21st. The marathon distance was covered quickly and comfortably by minibus, and the tour around the works proved to be\ninteresting and not a little surprising \u2014 in fact worth missing\na lecture or two.\nMany more bigger and better (even !) visits are in the off-ing, including CONCORDE!! Up to 45 Students will be\nable to come on this visit, which no other society in I.C. has\never managed to arrange before.\nKeep an eye on the Eng.

The game was\nmarred by the student referee (de put ising for the absent society ref) and numerous \"incidents\" arose \u2014\nespecially between members\nof both back rows!\nAfter their tremendous\nwins previously, I.C. looked\nfor a good points tally, but\nthis was foiled by some\nstrong forward play by\nKings. Superb in the line-out\nfor I.C. was fresher Roy\nMorris who won plenty of\ngood ball and must be well\nplaced with his performance\nThe scoring was opened by\nfull back Pudney who kicked\na35 yd penalty goal. After\na good handling movement\nKip Conolly went over for\na good try which Pudney\nconverted. Kings cut the\nlead with a penalty goal but\ncould not crack a resistant\nI.C. defence in the fast-paced second half.\nTEAM: Pudney, Anderson, Conolly (capt), Brownlee, Devaney, Roberts, Hill,\nDarling, Earl, Widelski,\nOwens, Morris, Hunt, Icely,\nAdams.\nThe 1st XV' s record now\nreads: played 5, won 4, lost\n1, pts for 106, pts against\n28.\nThis is a very good start\n\u2022to the season, some good\nvictories having been regis-te red. Royal Free Hospital\nI st XI unbeaten\nOn Saturday, 24 October\nI.C. entertained Q.E. C. in\nthe first round of the U.L. U. Cup. Q.E. C. turned out to\nbe a much tougher proposition to the team beaten in\na pre-season friendly, they\ntackled harder and faster,\nunsettling a weakened I.C. side fj or much of the first\nhalf. I.C. however took command in the second half\nwhen their fitness proved\nfatal for Q.E. C. Geoff Barnard, playing with real vigour and enthusiasm ran on\nto an R. Dixon pass to slot\nhome No. 1, this brought\nQ.E. C. out of steam and\nTony Holland took advantage, breaking away to score\ntwice. This was how it fin-is he d,3 nil. I.C.. were tired\nbut fully in command.\nOn Wednesday 28 again\nat Harlington, the 1st XI entertained the professional\nlooking Lanchester, a Teachers Training College in Coventry. Lanchester ran hard\nfor the first half but once\nagain I.C. came through in\nthe second half. Goals came\nfrom Byron Smith and T. McArdle. B. Smith playing\nhis first game for the l sts showed that he is going to\nbe a great asset. I.C.'s defence covered brilliantly during this game, Lanchester's goal coming from a silly\nmistake which should never\nhave occurred.\nI.C.'s goal tally now reads\n19 for \u2014 2 against after 5\ngames.\nTEAM FROM: N. Bakewell, P. Maslin, S. Boyce,\nC. Willcock, J. Darley, R. Dixon, P. Bartlett, P. Willie,\nT. McArdle, G. Barnard, B. Smith, T. Holland, J. Kelly.\nSpecial mention in the 2nd XI also unbeaten goes to\nBill Milne who has slammed 15 goals in 5 games.\nR. Dixon\nwere beaten by 49 pts to 6\npts on Wednesday 21st in\na match where the team\nreally \"clicked\" for the first\ntime. On the following Saturday a very good strong\nOld Guildfordians side was\nbeaten 15 pts to 8 pts at\nGuildford. An excellent\ngame, marred only by a serious injury to prop Dave\nAmos, who broke his collar\nbone and cracked a shoulder bone too. His strength\nVvill be surely missed in the\nmatches to come against the\nthe big club sides.\nThe Extra l sts under the\ncaptaincy of Tony Williams\nremain unbeaten and the\nRugby Club seem to have a rare spirit kindling in the\nlower sides.\nLate\nResults\n(see Felicity)\nMen's Hockey\nGuys Hospital 0\nI. C.1st XI 2\nOur first match of the\nseason played on 14 October\nproduced a well-earned victory against Guys. Although\nthe pitch was described as a 'cabbage patch' we managed\nto produce some constructive hockey.\nBoth our goals were\nscored by Dave Wilson, one\nof the two fresher s in the\nside, who hammered two\nshort corners in with considerable ease.\ni. C.1st XI 1\nWest Essex 1st XI 1\nAlthough we scored first\nthrough Dave Wilson we\nwere unable to contain the\nattack of the opponents who\nequalise d after a long corner shortly before half-time.\nLack of fitness was distinctly evident in the second\nhalf and despite good performances by Alistair\nForbes and Tim Watson, as\nfull backs, West Essex scored again. In the dying sec-on ds, our equalise r was disallowed lor obstruction.\nTurning to the lower\nelevens, the 2nd XI drew 1-1\nand 3rd XI and 4th XI won\n2-1 and 5-3 respectively.\nSt. John's Cambridge 0\nI. C.1st XI 1\nThis fixture was reduced\nto 8 men against 9 for most\nof the game due to injuries\nEDITORIAL In a page packed with good results for I.C. one notices\na disconcerting trend of dominance by the three big clubs\nof soccer, rugby, and hockey. As mentioned last week, the\ncollege possess some twenty clubs, half of which we never\nhear of. This does not mean they are not having successes\nin their own sport but are not involved with the University\nsport, many of them face disheartening problems of fixtures,\nfinance, facilities, etc. but instead of being depleted in numbers they seem to increase each year! The volleyball club,\nas an example, are negotiating with Brunei University to\ncombine members and facilities so that the club can enjoy\na national standard of fixtures \u2014 best of luck!\nConstituent college propaganda is already building up\nMorphy Day as an exercise in battle strategies and acquisition of the best \"ammo''! Let us not forget what it means to\nthe Boat Club, if to none else, at least! This is the annual\ninter-collegiate boat race for the Morphy Cup. Some intensive early season training has been endured for this race so\ngood luck to the three crews, if anyone takes any notice of\nthem. Guilds, with an international class of boat, must start\nfirm favourites.\nTo reiterate the first paragraph, we must have more\nnews of the smaller clubs for this to be a comprehensive\nsports page for the whole of I.C. Surely the table tennis club\nhave smashed someone lately?\ncaused by our new forward\nIan Tasney (now Mech Eng\nII), and the subsequent trip\nto the hospital.\nHowever we managed to\nscore from one of our many\nchances through Pete (Mas-ter?)

C.1st XI6, St. Edmund Hall\nOxford 1.\nSkiing on the cheap\nIC Ski Club offers you a chalet party in Europe at\nEaster which will cost a certain amount of money, but\nit also offers more local activities which are partly sponsored by the union, resulting\nin much cheaper skiing. For\ninstance, beginners and less\nexperienced skiers can gain\nenormous benefit from a course at the dry ski centre\nat Crystal Palace, for a paltry sum. More advanced\nskiers might like to try their\nlegs at grass skiing, using\ncaterpillar or tank-like\ntracks rather than normal\nskis. Hopefully, enough good\nskiers will train on the nearest hills to form an IC team\nto compete in the ever-grow-ing grass-skiing race circuit.\nFurthermore as a member\nof IC ski club, you are automatically in UL Ski Club,\nwhich skis regularly on the\nwaters of Ruislip Water Ski\nClub in the Summer.\nThe equipment you will\nneed for these variations of\nskiing is minimal: jeans, old\nsweater and gloves, or\na swimsuit. Skis, sticks etc.\ncan be rented for a very\nsmall fee.\nRacing on snow occurs in\nSwitzerland (UL are British\nAlpine Ski Champions 1970)\n\u2014 where certain racers will\nrace in the British and Commonwealth Winter Games\u2014\nand also in Scotland in February, March and April.\nLast year IC came second\nin the intercollegiate races\nand disappointingly UL were\nonly placed fourth in the\nUniversities races, behind\nOxford and two Scottish universities (whose team members were almost exclusively\nNorwegian).\nAll results and articles for next\nissue's Sports pages should be\ngiven to Mike Adams (Falmouth\n248) before midnight on Wednesday 11th November\nThus IC Ski Club can\noffer a great deal.
