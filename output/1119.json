This area is full of graffiti from the years\nfar away...\n.he\nfig\njsa\nit T he stories and myths of the\nlabyrinth of tunnels under Imperial\nCollege are something that almost\nevery student of the College is\nfamiliar with. Underground rivers,\nlinks with the Science Museum and\nwith a nuclear bomb shelter in Hyde Park are\ncommon tales. There was even a rumour that by\nfollowing a certain passage northwards, one\nwould eventually reach two Guards with machine\nguns. The most far-fetched tale of all came from\na member of the Rugby Club who later became\nunion President (and was therefore able to put\nhis considerable skills of rhetoric to good use).\nHe claimed that somewhere in the tunnels was a very large fan. This fan ran permanently except\nfor one hour a day when it was switched off to\nallow its bearings to cool- during this period it\nwas possible to step through the fan and access\na whole new series of tunnels.\nIt was with more interest than most that certain members of the adventurous clubs around\ncollege listened to these tales. They made it\ntheir aim to find out more, and over a period of\na few years, exploratory trips have been made\naround the campus.\nAt first it was necessity which lead M 'arse,\nJism and Goss who were living in ***** stores\nto a familiarity of the tunnels north of Prince\nConsort road. The need to get into the stores\nwhen there was a function going on at the union\nlead to the discovery of a tunnel leading under\nPrince Consort Road, conveniently reached by\nclimbing through a window into the stores itself.\nA desire to attend the Freshers' Ball without paying led Goss on an obscure route through the\nBiology Department to the roof of Beit, around\nthe roof and down North East stairs into the Ball\nwalking past the back of the security guard.\nExploration of the course of the pipes lead to the\nback of the S+G store room and a further set of\nnasty crawling passages leading right around Beit\nquad.\nWicky and Friends were more interested in\nthe climbing potential around college, and over a series of excursions managed to climb the front\nof the union as well as the front of the RSM\nbuilding. Working on a lab in the basement of\nMechanical Engineering, Jism and M 'arse began\nto explore this area - they found that it is possible to access the main tunnels very easily from\nthe inside of Mechanical Engineering during the\nday, but even at night when the main door is\nlocked it is possible to get in via an obscure\nsqueeze past a pipe. The tale of the river was\ncleared up when a large pipe spouting water into\nan open tank was found. It did indeed sound like\na river from a distance. The source of this flow is\nnot known, but is unlikely to be caused by the\ncombined toilet flush of the building!\nAfter a while the explorers started sharing\nstories, and a few combined trips were under-taken. The most convenient entrances to the\n24 June 1998 FEATURE 25\nsystem were found to be Mechanical\nEngineering, Chemistry (this is now covered by\nthe medical building) and at the base of the\nQueens tower. The tunnel under Exhibition Road\nwas found, which leads directly into the back of\nSouthside bar as well as to a shaft to the roof of\nthe halls. One excursion through chemistry happened to coincide with the burglar alarm at the\nscience museum going off and we were caught\nby a snooping policeman as we were going in -some fast talking being necessary!\nDuring a Last Night of the Proms filming session at the Royal Albert Hall, Jism Wicky and\nM 'arse managed to bullshit their way into the car\npark under the RAH. While Jism diverted the\nGuards attention Wicky and M 'arse took a look\nat a doorway at the back. It seemed to have that\nfamiliar smell of disused tunnels and would be\nworth further explorations.\nBut the most exciting lead of all was a20 metre shaft leading into what looked like a grating and then the lights of a room in Queen's Tower. Looking at this, we realised that it wasn't possible to climb it, but with the help of a bolting kit and a few et riers( mini ture flexible lad-der s), it was possible to get to an intermediate\nledge about 4 metres up. The noise of the bolting hammer was clearly audible from the outside\nof the tower, but as it wasn't clear where it was\ncoming from, no one seemed to care- no one\nwould have imagined what we were actually trying to do.\nFrom this point Wicky did a bit of\nhairy acrobatics and managed to gain a few more meters. Exploration went a pace as we were able to put equipment bought for the ****** expedition to good\nuse - a bolting platform and the Bosch drill! We\nhad a few scares during these bolting sessions,\nbut the only person who noticed our activities\nwas the old tramp who lives down in the tunnels.\nWe spoke a few words occasionally to him but\ngenerally just said hello. After about two years of\noccasional exploration trips we finally managed\nto climb our way into the QT, rigging a permanent Y hang for future trips. The first person on\nfuture trips would always use a second dynamic\nrope and the intermediate bolts with extend ers so they could check the rope in safety. On a later\ntrip, Froggy took his full cave photography equipment and took some excellent photos of the\nshaft - before dropping his camera down it!\nAssorted excursions continue, and a plan of\nthe tunnels is gradually taking shape (below).\nThere are many unknown leads still to investigate,\nand the continuous building work destroys and\nreveals new passages all the time. Not just\nImperial College, but also the Natural History\nMuseum, the Albert Hall, the Post Office, the\nLondon Underground and the Ministry of Defence\nall have tunnels on or next to the campus.\nTunnel dives under flo of and become un pleas ar Many small passages:\nand stores Sc cr.i Princes Garden Tuhnel deep under road\nPrinces Gardens I!100 'ladders to roof,\nj penthouse & level 4\n' gents\nFelix does NOT advise anyone to attempt to 3.

    "content": "24 June 1998 COLUMNS 10 gt ej THOUGHT FOR THE DAY\nMein Kampf\nFresher s, you are no longer.\nTry to remember your first\nday in hall; it probably\ninvolved much unpacking, a moment spent deciding how many\nposters it would take to cover the\nwalls, serious drinking, a half-drunken mental estimation of the\nmale/female ratio, possibly vomit-ing. Tonsil hockey, if you were particularly blessed. Then there was\nthe week you spent not going to\nlectures while you met a load of\npeople from your hall, people you haven't spoken to since week three. Freshers' Fair, where you signed up for eighty-five clubs,\njoined one of them, and then\ndecided that your time would be\nbetter spent in Southside.\nRemember lectures? They were the\nboring things you attended for the\nfirst term only. Believe it or not,\nbut some people have still got\nthem. Some of you will have discovered drugs. Some of you will\nhave discovered sex. Some will\nhave embraced alcohol. A number\nof you will have done all three.\nFollowing a first term in which\nyou probably saw someone you fancied cavorting with someone else (such a Hall phenomenon that\nsomeone in my first year thought\nhe might make a soap about it),\nyou probably spent most of the latter half of the second term missing\nlectures. Some of you will be worrying about having failed their\nexams. Some will be panicking\nabout next year's accommodation. Most will be deciding their plans\nfor the summer. Iam convincing\nmyself that I won't be going to\nGlastonbury again.\nAt this moment in time, the\naverage student's plans for the\nsummer should be something along these lines: pay overdraft;\ncatch up on all missed work from\npast year; watch a small amount of\nWorldCup/ Test matches/ Wimbledon( delete as appr opr i ate); sleep; eat; go to Amsterdam; remember to keep in touch with all\nthe lovely new friends from College. By the end of the holiday,\nall of these aims will have been\nrealised barring just two. I shall\nleave the estimation of which two\nas an exercise for the reader.\nThis year has also seen my rise\nfrom a humble engineering student\nto a revered word smith, capable of\ntwisting the English language into\nsuch exquisite shapes that unsuspecting students have been known\nto die outright on Friday mornings,\nupon experiencing the pure ecstasy imparted by my writing. When1 strolled into the Felix office at the\nbeginning of the year, only barely\nfamiliar with how it looked inside, I certainly did not expect to leave it\nwith a regular column. Luckily, I was in the right place at the right\ntime when the harassed editor,\nplaced under the Felix girder for\nthe duration of the year, was desperate for some material to fill a quarter-page. Two weeks later,\nwhen I ventured into the office\nagain, 1 was asked where my contributions had been.\nSo began my second year,\nregarded widely as being \"the\nworst year of your life\". At first the\nnovelty of becoming a minor\ncelebrity, and having people that I didn't even know recognise me,\nwas sufficient motivation to keep\nchurning out the literary bilge. By\nthe end of the first term I was getting pretty hacked off with my\ncoursework, and even more hacked off writing five hundred\nwords per week. A few punters\npointed out that they could not\nunderstand where I got my ideas\nfrom. They had obviously not seen\nme pacing a path into the floor for\nthree hours while attempting to\nchain-smoke a workable theme\ninto my head. It was perhaps not\nsurprising, then, when reported\nripples of poor quality, ego mania cal drivel began to spoil the unbroken surface of my half-page's moonlit lake. The less imaginative\nof these include the Features\nEditor's poetic description of one\ncomposition which made rather\ntoo heavy use of the word \"shit\".\nThe most notable contributor\nto these tidal waves of abuse was\na certain ex-girlfriend of mine.\nRather than greeting me with\nsomething gratifying such as,\n\"Hello. I 've missed you,\"1 got a comment stating that my material\nwas \"nothing more than self-in d ul gent twaddle\", before she went on\nto steal my cigarettes and take up\nvaluable space on the sofa.\nHaving known virtually zero\nabout the workings of the Union\nlast year, during all that New Election rubbish, I decided perhaps\nthat readers weren't that interested in the Union or College at all. I thought I'd write about something\na bit different. My aim was to turn\nout something interesting; a mus ing; occasionally bizarre; not\nwrapped up in politics and fairly\nclean. What eight thousand readers probably got was something\neccentric; peculiar; egocentric;\npolitics-free but still rather boring;\nand fairly clean. Try thinking of thirty different ideas that might be\namusing, and then think of four to\nsix hundred words' worth of material for each, and you will begin to\nsee the flaw in the plan.\nHaving said that, I reckon a few\nvalid points were made on the\nway. Will sheer processing power\nconquer Shakespeare? Is an ego\ndesirable? Will Geri succeed on her\nown? And most importantly, who is Columbo' s dealer? Despite\nepoch making questions like\nthese, my only correspondence\nover the entire year came from a medical student who had postulated an intriguing scientific theorem\ninvolving curry.\nFelix, also, has seen some changes. Sub-editors have come and gone; enthusiastic music reviewers have made the office\ntheir own on a Friday afternoon; an\nIC Radio page has mysteriously\nappeared; a premature April Fool's jape has fooled hundreds; the\nnews team have evaporated like\nideas for a column; and finally the\nold Felix site has been sacrificed\nfor something far less interesting,\naided by some preemptive destruction by a homeless student\nnewspaper's staff.\nSo I carry my column's cross to\nGolgotha, the Place of the Skull,\nand see it crucified along with\n\"Digs the Dirt\" and \"Westminster\nEye\", one on either side. Not that I claim these scribbles are in any\nway God-like. On the contrary,\nTFTD will soon go to hell. And the\nrobbers? Everlasting life.\nAli Campbell\nWe regret any inconvenience to customers whilst\nthe JCR is renovated\nALL STUDENTS\nDuring the summer vacation, BREAKFAST will\nbe available in the SENIOR COMMON ROOM on a daily basis from 7.30 am - 10. am.\nLUNCH( including Quicks and the Curry Bar) will\nbe available in the MAIN DINING HALL. \"QT\" and the Vending service will continue in the\nJCR, although there will be NO SEATING.\n\n"

    "content": "COLUMNS 24 June 1998\nr Blair is a pretty straight sort\nof guy. At least,\nthis is certainly what the\nLabour publicity machine would\nhave us believe. In Northern Ireland\nTony Blair made a simple handwritten pledge concerning the connection between the release of\nparamilitary prisoners which was\nconsidered to have had an enormous effect on Unionist opinion of\nthe Good Friday Agreement. When\nthe press lambasted him over the\nmillion-pound donation to Labour\nby Bernie Ecclestone, followed by\nthe exemption of Formula One racing from the ban on tobacco advertising, Tony addressed the nation in\na fireside chat about how honest he\nwas and how, like ordinary people,\nhe made mistakes too. He didn't miss the opportunity to upbraid the\npress for daring to accuse him of\nbasic corruption.\nNaturally then the public will\nrelax while Blair and Ashdown\nannounce that they would be working together \"to put power closer\nto the people\". They also intend to\nrenew the constitution and\nstrengthen our individual rights.\nSome of this seems to be genuine.\nThe creation of the Scottish\nParliament, Welsh Assembly and\nGreater London Assembly should\nbring decision-making down to a more local level. No-one doubts\nthat the Conservative Government\ndrew power to the national government from local authorities on an\nunprecedented scale and that its\nLabour successors are looking at\nways to reverse this process.\nHowever, the constitutional\nplans Labour have are far more\nominous. Britain is one of the few\nnations in the world not to have a written constitution, which is made\nup instead of a patchwork of parliamentary legislation and convention\nand common law. This puts it in a fragile state, although most politicians respect its status above party\npolitical advantage. It seems there\nare three fronts on which the\nGovernment intends to secure\nincrease power for itself. The enormous majority Labour has in the\nCommons, and the ever-stratos-ph eric public support it currently\nenjoys gives it a great opportunity\nto push through changes thought\nuntenable by previous administrations. Lord Richard, the Labour\nLeader of the Lords, confirmed the\nGovernment's intention to remove\nthe right of hereditary peers to\nspeak and vote in the Lords. This\nhas been known previously and has\n, popular support. As detailed in\ntheir manifesto, the Government\ndo not intend to replace the Upper\nChamber with anything until they\nhave had a full consultation as to\nwhat to replace it with - which\nleaves an indefinite period of time\nwhere the Chamber of Parliament\ndesigned to sc rut in is e the work of\nthe Commons will be filled with\nTony's friends and other Labour\nplace men. It would become 'Blair's poodle' in the same way the Lords\nwas 'Balfour's poodle' in the early\n1900s. This would be less likely to\nhappen if Lords reform happened\nin one go, and it seems discussion\nis all but exhausted as to the possibilities available in a reform. This\ni lar minded individuals) which will\nwithout an iota of doubt return suggesting we use proportional representation in Parliament. The\nGovernment has already allowed it\nto seep into political life through\nthe Scottish Parliament (partly\nelected by PR) and the new electoral procedure for Britain's members of the European Parliament.\nWe will undoubtedly be offered the\nopportunity to vote for PR in a ref-er end um, which will naturally bring\npower to the people etc. and with\nthe evidence that it worked in\nScotland and Europe, combined\nI pp ll ff Hamish Common\nWestminster\nEye\nregrettably suggests that the only\nreason for this 'two-part' reformation is to give the Prime Minister\neffective total control over the\nmembership of the Upper House,\nmeaning that so much as a squeak\nfrom its appointed members, and\nHer Majesty will find herself\ndelighted to summon twenty new\nLabour hacks to the House.\nThe next ominous sign is the\nway the Government seem to have\nbeen handling referendums. The\nman oe uv ring over the arrangement\nof questions for the Scottish\nParliament referendum and the\nprepared timing of the Welsh referendum to be a week after the\nScottish one (tacticians calculated\nthat the uprising of feeling after the\ncertain \"Yes\" vote of the Scottish\nreferendum would persuade the\nWelsh), combined with some blatant ministerial propaganda suggests that the Government would-n't be amiss to vague wordings and\ncareful timing to bias the result of\nreferenda. With the Lords as an\nenergetic poodle, legislation for\nsuch referenda shouldn't be difficult (it's already happened). The\nGovernment has already been lobbying the Neill inquiry, urging legal\nlimits on referenda campaign\nspending to muffle publicity for the\n'wrong' side of a referendum,\nallowing ministers to create propaganda as required.\nTo go back to the beginning\nagain, the co-operation between\nLabour and Liberal Democrats on\n'constitutional issues' is far more\nworrying in the present context\nwhere Labour genuinely could push\nthrough dangerous measures. Lord\nJenkins has been running a review\ncommittee (entirely staffed by sim-with the steamroller method used\nto push it through, we may well\nvote for it in the end.\nThe main purpose of PR is to\nkeep Labour and the Lib Dems in\npower. That is all there is to it. Each\nparty talks of the advantages of\neach system, but essentially the\nConservative and Labour parties\nopposed it because our first-past-the-past system kept them in\npower and the Liberal Democrats\nwanted PR, which would give them\npower. Labour's initial opposition\nhas been softened as they have\nfound a way to kee the Tories out\nhopefully for good.\nPeople may disagree with this\ncolumn, suggesting that PR would\nactually work, and that it is disgraceful that the Greens/Lib\nDems/whoever else's parliamentary\nrepresentation is woefully short of\nits electoral mandate, leaving the\ntwo dominant parties in absolute\npower. However to see the real\nproblems of PR, one has to step\nback from the plights of individuals\nand parties. The first past the post\nsystem gives the UK and elective\ndictatorship, where one party\n(more accurately, one Prime\nMinister) has vast power for five\nyears. Then the people vote and\nthe government remains in power\nor is replaced.\nWith PR the situation will be different. This time, no party will in\nreality ever have overall control,\nand will have to form a coalition.\nThis may improve things on the\nlines that the smaller parties will be\nable to form coalitions and have\nsome say in the affairs of govern-ment. While this may sound fine, it\ncauses a host of dangerous problems. It firstly gives the Head of\nState (in our case the Sovereign\nwho is supposed to stay out of pol-it ics) the fearsome responsibility of\ninviting a person to form a coal i tion, seeing if it can be done, and if\nnot inviting someone else and so\non. As far as a person's vote counting for what finally gets into power,\nthe second largest party usually\nwouldn't be invited to join, so their\nvotes wouldn't matter as much as\nthe votes for the smaller parties.\nAssume Labour had got most\nvotes in a General Election here.\nThen Her Majesty would ask the\nLabour leader to form a coalition,\ngiving him say, a week to do so\n(otherwise his Downing Street days\nare over). He would ask say, the Lib\nDems and the Ulster Unionists to\ndo so, otherwise he won't have\nenough votes and another General\nElection could be called. Therefore\nthe Lib Dems and the Ulster\nUnionists could exact whatever\nthey wanted out of them, as happens all the time in countries with\nPR.\nAll the people who voted for\nthe opposition party don't get a look in. The small parties receive a voice totally out of proportion with\ntheir electoral mandate, the\nGovernment governs the country to\nappease some minute party rather\nthan the electorate, and the whole\nGovernment can be knocked down\nby a small party pulling out of a coalition. Italy's unstable PR system\nhas caused endless embarrassment\nto it on the world stage, leaving it\nwithout coherent policies and\ndecreasing respect by its people for\nits government. New Zealand is\nbeginning to regret its decision to\nincorporate PR into its Parliament.\nBut there is something even\nmore sinister about PR, which\nexplains its support by some of the\nBlairite Labour appa rat chi ks. As the\nnumber of seats gained in the\nParliament is proportional to the\nnumber of votes cast, the principle\nof constituencies and MPs for a particular area disappears. Instead\nthe party would draw up ordered\nlists of members. Therefore the\nparty would have total and\nabsolute control over its parliamentary membership. Any discordant\nvoices would be silenced by threat\nof disappearing off the lists for the\n'ballot-box' in the next election.\nInternal party democracy, already\nbadly damaged by Labour in the\npast three years, would breathe its\nlast. Rather than putting power in\nthe hands of the people and individual members, PR places it in the\nhands of party leaders, a motley\ncollection of small parties and noone else. A less democratic system\nwould be hard to fathom.\n\n"

    "content": "24 June 1998 GAMES 53\nPC 2D&3D GRAPHICS HARDWARE\nVIPER 330\nDiamond Multimedia, \u00a369 it it it-k In the dark distant past PCs\nbleeped their way through low-res-ol uti on games. First the soundcard\nremoved the bleeping and added\nFM music; millions of soundcard s were then sold. Next high resolution graphics cards allowed us to\nplay games with decent graphics.\nNow the 3D accelerated graphics\ncard seem to be following the same\npath as games start to demand a3D card. These graphics cards\ncome in two main groups, the pure\n3D accelerator cards and the more\ngeneral 2D/3D cards. The difference between the two groups can\ngenerally be compared to the difference between owning a sports\ncar or a hot hatchback. Everyone\nknows that a sports car will generally beat the hatchback, but the\nhatchback is something you can\nuse everyday. So hatchback test\nnumber one, the Viper 330. Is it\nPeugeot 306 Gti or MG metro\nturbo?\nThe Viper 330 is powered by a GAME REVIEW\nMEN IN BLACK\nSouthPeak Interactive,\nPC / Playstation DO StdTS\nWith, I believe, the slimmest\nexceptions of Batman, Indiana\nJones and the Last Crusade and\nthe odd Star Wars titles, games\nunder film licences are unadulterated, indefensible slurry. Et, quelle\nsurprise, here we are with Men in\nBlack. Maybe this would be the\none? The mould breaker? Could\nSouthpeak Interactive be the ones\nto pull Men in Black out of the\ncesspool? Well, no.\nIt all looked bad from the start;\nvery slick menu system, expensive\nTV adverts, MiB cartoon influences\nin the intro sequence; just not\nwhat you' d want. And then the\ngame. You (Will Smith) investigate\na break-in a New York apartment\nbuilding. At least you do when you persuade your at fuck-utterly badly\nanimated irritation of a character\nto point in the right direction at the\ndoor handle. Progressing through\nthe door, you are greeted by the\npiss-poor sample \"Som'in tells me\nthis mus' be da place\". And that is\nthe best in the game. The objective, I learn, is to kill the baddies\nand disarm the bomb. Ah yes, a fight scene. I was looking forward\n128bit NVIDIA Riva 128 with a230 MHz RAM DAC impressive specifications. The 4 MB onboard memory allows you to run resolutions of 1 6 0 0 x1200 at 6 5 , 0 0 0\ncolours at a high refresh rates\n8 5 Hz. The 2 D performance is not\nespecially fast compared for 2 D cards. However, PC Magazine's tests showed that it is within 12%\nof the 2D/3D leader, the Matrox\nMillenium II.\nThis card though is not optimized for the graphical \"school run\nand shopping trip\" but it is the 3D performance where the card is seriously good. The image quality is\nalmost up to 3Dfx level (the current\ntop sports ter) and though there\nwere the odd incorrect polygon\nclipping errors, they were not\nenough to irritate. It doesn't support Glide (the low-level interface\nsupported by 3Dfx cards and used\nin many games) but is able to run\nsome openGL (ie. quake) and all\nDirectX (ie. Tomb raider 2) games,\nto this. There are two ways of\nscrapping, both dreadful to con-tro l, one being 'stand still and kick\nthem in the shins until they die'\nand the other being shooting them\nfrom long range (you miss from\nanything shorter then about six\nfeet). Enemies have no intelligence\nwhatsoever, running straight\ntowards you and crouching,\npunching badly in the direction\nthey crouched in, allowing even\nthe least experienced gamer to run\nbehind them and boot them up the\narse. The animation - mentioned\nbefore - is astonishingly bad. When the character jumps it is an undisguised rehash of the walking\nand run them at speed. Even on a Pentium 120 resolution changes\ndidn't really compromise the high\nframe rates. Tomb Raider 2 was\ntested using resolutions from\n3 2 0 x200 to 800x600. Where the Viper 330 has a real\nedge is in price. At the sub \u00a3 1 0 0\nlevel it beats the other 2D/3D cards\nhands down, makin it an affordable\nhot hatchback. At this price it also\ncompetes against the older pure\n3D cards. Here the car analogy is\nback again - while everyone would\nlove a sports car on their drive\nsometimes your head has to rule\nyour heart and you buy the hot-hatch because it is almost perfect.\nAnyway you can always buy that\nsports car later and so too with the\npure 3D card.\nGary Smith\nanimation moved linearly upwards\nthen downwards, with normal\ngrav it ic motion effects abandoned\nmercilessly. Making use of anything requires camp arm-waving\nfor several seconds in the vague\ndirection of the object like Kenneth\nWilliams chastising a small child\nwith a light slap around the ear.\nBut less funny. The puzzles are not\neven slightly challenging, relying\nexclusively on a drab combination\nof tricks and oh-so obvious clues,\nand suffering from the dreaded\nfind-the-pixel disease. I'm afraid\nthat seemed incurable. The intentional \"humour\" is stretched at\nbest, the unintentional more so\nMORE GAMES\nTREASURES\nOF THE DEEP\nNamco, Playstation it it it it\nDiving suits, sharks, submarines\nand really excellent 3D graphics.\nTreasures from the Deep has\npretty much everything including\nexcellent strategy/action game-play. As a navy seal you have to\ncomplete a series of missions\nfrom the shallows of the\nCaribbean using wet suits and\nchariots to the deep sea antics of\nthe Arctic oceans. Fortunately\ndecompression sickness is not a feature as you soon afford proper\nsubs. Against you, the denizens of\n| the deep, along with an army of\ndivers and their submarines. On your side your basic weapon, a spear gun might seem a bit wet,\nbut soon you will be buying nets,\ntorpedoes and homing missiles to\neven the odds. Take too many torpedoes or air though and you\nhave no extra capacity for bonus\ntreasure found near wrecks but\ntake too little and you are shark\nbait. The graphics are crisp, and\nthe distance fogging removes\nmost of the nasty popup events.\nThe fish and sharks also show\nsome intelligence (or lack of it).\nFish tend to mind their own business while sharks are attracted by\nblood - either yours or someone\nelse's. So don the wet suit and\nsnare, shoot and maim but avoid\nthe endangered species because\nthey're not big or clever.\nGary Smith\nin after the first couple of glitches. To\ngive a little bit of credit, the artwork on the backgrounds was well\nexecuted, notably the competent\nand stylish vistas and movie-faith-ful attention to detail. The point of\nview, a Resident Evil style third\nperspective was a good idea for\nthe game, but the effect was\nspoiled by slightly obtuse camera\nangles. You can change characters\nonce you've completed the first\nlevel and are indoctrinated in the\nMiB, but it doesn't change the\ngameplay a touch. You are still a badly animated, witless and infuriatingly stupid figure, be you a thin\nblack man (Smith), a stocky white\nman (Tommy Lee Jones), or a poorly pix elated and overly wide\nfemale (apparently Linda\nFiorentino).\nA complete waste of time,\nmoney and licence.

No change there,\nthen.\n1099: 21 November 97\nMoaning Witch\nIt couldn't be long before whispers\nof IC sports teams and their\ndestructive capabilities began to filter through into the office. This\nweek, the first of these incidents\nwas given the glory of the front\npage: seems the football team\n(ICUAFC) got a bit too rowdy somewhere along their \" Ham my Ten\" pub crawl. One of the pubs'\nstaff described the team as\n\"extremely obnoxious\" - surely he\nwas mistaken? Also on the front\npage was the news that Sir Patrick\nMayhew had come to educate the\nimpressionable ConSoc flock; he\nwas quoted as saying that he\n\"deserved an Oscar\". We pause to\nconsider the quantity of legislation\nrequired to award all Conservative\nMPs an Oscar at the ceremony\nbefore going home for some cannabis ... news. Readers will have\neither smiled or frowned at the\nblocks of hashish-based enlightenment which have dropped from the\npurple haze this year, but a small\narticle heralding BM A observations\nconcerning use of cannabis for\nmedical purposes did appear with\nthe most excellent headline: \" BM A Deals Blow to Anti-Drugs Lobby\".\nNice one, Features Editor.\nOtherwise, the careers fair\nreceived record turnout, and\nHelen-Louise Windsor was awarded the post of RCSU President.\nLucky her.\n1100: 28 November 97\nComputer Sex\nThe Principal Sheaf of the Students'\nNewspaper at Imperial College was\nthe site of mixed fortunes on this\nparticular Friday morning. Firstly\nthere were the Praed Street rapes\n(bad news; on this we shall not\ndwell) followed by news of a second large demonstration against\ntuition fees (good news. Why, I'd show the bloody government a thing or two if I could just get out of\nthis chair.)\nGood news for excitable and\nsex-starved computing students\nthis week was that DOC were\nreceiving a Fujitsu AP3000 com put er. This was (and with luck, still is)\nequipped with the following attributes: eighty nodes, 12.5 Gb of\nmemory, 336 Gb of internal drive\nspace and a theoretical peak performance of 45.6 Gigaflops.\n(Steady, now.) Oh, and the\nChemistry undergraduate common room was closed: presumably the\nspace was needed for storing more\nchemicals for fabricating drugs and\nexplosives.\n1101: 5 December 97\nBang!\nYou were no decent student if you did not at least have a quick guffaw\nat the \"Chemistry Computer Meltdown\". Felix reported: \" On Sunday 16 September... all lights...\nbegan to flicker and blow; the air\nconditioning system failed; dormant electrical appliances eerily\nswitched themselves on and the\nculmination came with the explosion of electrical equipment\" most apocalyptic. Could this be the\nend of the world as we know it...?\nIt was quite an amusing week all\nround for those finding pleasure in\ncock-ups: apparently new electronic locks fitted in Beit Hall could be\nopened using the old credit-card\ntrick, which will have pleased a lot\nof robbers fancying themselves as\nClint Eastwood.\n1102: 17 December 97\nDrugs\nA flaming piece of paper stuck to a door, again in Beit Hall, resulted in\nthe residents standing out in their\npyjamas for a while. Very fetching,\nln fact, it seems likely that the\nwords \"Look out, Security is com ing\" might well have been written\non the paper. Naughty students\nwho should have known better\nwere caught smoking the old Jamaican Woodbine s in both\nLinstead and Beit, presumably getting into the Christmas spirit rather\ntoo early.\n1103: 16 January 98\nArt Critics\n1 wouldn't like to be a builder. More particularly, 1 wouldn't like to have\nbeen one of the builders working\non Me ch Eng renovations this week\nin January, who discovered a decade-old severed human foot\nplanted as a prank by some medics\nyears before. Many students\nwished that the foot had belonged\nto Douglas Trainer, NUS President,\nas student unions nationwide displayed dissent at the NUS' handling\nof the tuition fees issue.\nArguably the most dramatic\nhappening of the year was chronicled in 1103: the 22-Club, RCS\nelective social club, was banned for\ntwo years from all College premises\nfollowing a slight faux pas.\nMembers dining in the Main Dining\nHall decided to explore the Ante\nRoom Gallery, not realising that an\nart exhibition lay ready to be\nopened in a few days. Felix report-ed:\"... the revellers... began to\nabuse the artworks... with wine,\ncigarette burns and vomit. An offensive note was also found ...\ndescribing the perpetrator'so pin ion...\" The damage was estimated\nat about \u00a3 7 0 0 - let's just thank God that there was toilet paper in the\nlaw y.1105:30 January 98\nBuses Don't Float\nPolitics bore many people, so ICU\nwas in for a treat when the papers\nwent up for yet another round of\ns abb elections. The ICU Boat Club's fortunes improved this week, when\nsome philanthropic part of society\ndecided to hand them \u00a3 7 0 3 , 5 0 0\nfor restoration of its Putney training\nsite. It is also worth noting that the\nBoat Club had rather worse luck the\nweek after, when their minibus was\nfound floating in the Thames. Still,\nI'm sure they can afford a new one.\n1106: 6 February 98\nHeeps, Andy Heeps\nICU Presidents are like James Bond\nactors. Each has his or her own classic style to bring to the job. This\nwas highlighted when Andrew Heeps and Eric Allsop described\nthe floundering City and Guilds\nUnion as \"a joke\" and \"a bunch of\narse\" respectively. So which of the\ntwo is George Lazenby?\n1109: 27 February 98\nDrugs II\nDespite the rather fascist democracy sometimes employed by the\nmedical schools to rig ICU elections, four sabbatical posts were\nfilled first time round: Ed Sexton\n(Felix), Dave Wharton (DP F&S), Dave Hellard (ICU President) and\nAdam Cherrington (DP C&S) were\nall blessed by the ballot box.\nWaterstone's, having cheekily\nswiped the College bookstore deal,\ndecided it would be quite nice to\nstart selling cards and stationery as\nwell - what's next?

There are\nno easy answers to these ques-t ions, and the book doesn't insult\nour intelligence by providing any.\nThis is Toni Morrison's first\nbook since winning the Nobel Prize\nfor Literature in 1993 and is a regular four de force. She writes with\namazing clarity and fluency, and\nher ideas are beautifully\nexpressed. Right from the first sen-ten ce,( They shoot the white girl\nfirst), we are flung into a difficult\nand dangerous world, full of\ninequalities both between races\nand sexes.

I for\none get worked up into a state of\nfrenzied excitement at the thought\nthat questions relating to the work\nof my greatest hero might come up\nthis year. I'm sure I speak for thousands of other students when I say\nthat May and June are definitely the\nmost thrilling months in the cale n dar.\nIndeed, the exam period is\nsuch a major event that it can be\nused to justify the inclusion of all\nmanner of pointless statistics: during the summer term, 5,000 students of all nationalities will take\napproximately 250 exams at\nvenues all across the campus.\nThey will use 6,479 answer books\nand produce 11,500 buckets of\ncold sweat, while that guy who\nalways says You have five minutes\nremaining', will have walked a distance of 539 miles supplying extra\nanswer books. Imperial College\nCatering are expecting an extra \u00a32\nmillion in revenue from the sale of\nas many as 200 JCR sandwiches.\nAs we enter the final weeks\nbefore the exams, a lot is at stake:\nsuccess brings glory and the potential of huge financial gain, while failure brings a year of derision from\nyour colleagues and the almost certain sacking of tutors and lecturers.\nSo it is natural for excitement to\nreach fever pitch. It is quite normal\nto see large crowds gathering outside the hall before an exam, chanting Faraday's Law of Induction and\nwaving banners with Schrodinger's equation written on them, their\nfaces painted with various assortments of Greek letters.\nThose who can't actually be\nthere stay at home with a few\nmates and drink copious amounts\nof lager.

However, in\nrecent years we have seen the\nemergence of a new and highly\nthreatening phenomenon: science\nhooliganism. Some students take\nthings too far and are determined\nto use what should be an enjoyable\nday out as an excuse for violence\nand destruction. Last year, there\nwere a number of disturbing incidents at our College.\nOne night, a group of drunken\nphysics students, using the name\nEinstein's Army, scrawled 'E=mc2' all over the front of the\nBiochemistry building in red paint.\nIn retaliation, a gang of thugs calling themselves the Louis Pasteur\nAppreciation Society raided the\nPhysics Department in the early\nhours of the morning and drew\nlarge protein molecules on the\nblackboard in the main lecture the-at re. Things came to a head when\nan exam had to be called off after a violent confrontation between the\ntwo groups. Many innocent candidates were hurt after in vigil at or s in\nriot gear were called in to break up\nthe disturbance.

    "content": "54 TWO SHORT STORIES 24 June 1998\nTwo kids were playing with a rubber ball. They were standing outside a hi-fi shop, it was winter,\ncold &. crisp, usual winter stuff. One of the kids\ncaught the ball and threw it hard at the ground\ntowards his friend. He was on the pavement and\nit was frozen solid, the ball bounced high off the\nsheet black ice, across the front of the shop.\nThe shop was like many of the breed scattered around London. Small, cramped but well\nlit and with enough stock to fill a supermarket.\nAnd it was by supermarket rules it operated,\nwell the cheap ones anyway. The owner was aMr Skanket. A short, brown fat man. Dark eyes,\npiercing, no bullshit sort. He knew almost nothing about hi-fis, in fact before coming into ownership of this property he worked selling win-dow s, which he was equally good at. What he\nreally knew about was people, he knew, as you say, what makes them tick. Particularly\nhe knew about the English. The English he\nloved, he might have been English himself or Asian, it didn't matter. He was a different breed. What he loved about the\nEnglish and particularly the older 'more\nEnglish' generation was their politeness,\ntheir manners and their mannerisms. An Englishman if he is a gentleman can't say\n'bullshit' when you tell him some second\nrate piece of junk , second hand in a car\nboot sale is the latest technology. An Englishman will say 'really, is that so?'\nand do his best to believe. He knows he's being ripped off, he knows you are going\nas slowly as possible, making him waste\nyour time, but to contradict you would be\nimpolite. It would break that code which\nhe hangs his whole life on. If you swear,\nsay 'shit' or 'fuck' or even 'you stupid\narse wipe, get a life, go get laid, do something. For fucks sake stop pretending you're so goddamned self con-trolled.' He'll say 'Hold on a minute,\ndon't you dare use that sort of language\non me'. And storm out. However play by\nthe rules, loosely maybe but go by them and\nyou'll be fine. Fine, fine, fine.\nSo it was unsurprising when the middle\naged, weather beaten, pink, thin to the point of\nwasted, balding with white hair swept across,\nhalf mooned glasses, old tweed suited man\npeered through the glass, Mr Skanket was pleased to see him. Mr Skanket showed his\ngratitude by starting to scribble numbers on a pad in front of him. The bell rang loudly and Mr Skanket looked up. The man looked from the\nopen door, into the shopkeepers eyes, for a full\nhalf second and then quickly looked down. Embarrassed he started to work his way around\nthe shop. There wasn't far to go so the shopkeeper waited for the inevitable. The man\nlooked up, perhaps to see some of the products\nmore than a foot above the ground, but he\nlooked up and caught Mr Skanket's eye. Both of\nthem.\n\"Can I help you sir?\" He put down the\npapers firmly.\n\"Err. Well. Yes... Um.1 hope that you can do that\" he labour ed it out. Tittering nervously at\nthe end. Mr Skanket answered fiercely,\n\" Do what? What can Ido for you?\" This\nthrew the customer. He wasn't that old, maybe\nsenility struck early in his family. He tittered\nagain. Then with another burst of courage,\n\"It's for my sister, she writes poems and I'm looking for an organiser for her. An electronic\none, not too expensive... \" He trailed off into\nsilence. The store keeper got off his stool and\nwalked stiffly around the counter.\n\"I show you what I have got.\"\nHe passed close to the customer, standing\nby each other the old man despite his stoop\nstood a good foot taller. Inspite of this he\nseemed to have no presence at all. To hardly\ntake up any room in the shop. He shuffled mis-wide screen, Windows.\" The customer frowned\nand made a weak attempt at looking stern.\n\"This isn't right, I need an organiser. And would you kindly sell me one or 1 will leave the\nshop.\" Mr Skanket looked tired.\n\"This is an organiser. See.\" With a fat finger\nhe typed ' WIN' onto the screen. Windows duly\nappeared.\n\" Now, put your finger on the pad and move\nthe pointer here.\" The man looked red but put a thin finger onto the black roller pad. The store\nkeeper clicked the button for him and some\norganiser program was loaded.\n\"There, see.\" The customer muttered mutely but Mr Skanket was not going to be stopped\nnow,\n\"You say your sister writer poetry, well look.\nLook.\" He loaded the word processor. \" Modern technology. Isn't it wonderful.\"\n\"That it maybe,\" the victim muttered, \"but\nhow amI to afford it?\"\n\"You want to know the price?\"\n\"Yes. That would be good of you.\" Mr Skanket ignored the answer\nand looked into the box. \"Let me show you this first. With it you get\nthis.\" He pulled out an instruction\nmanual. \"I give this to you free, others wouldn't.I do. And this, here is\nthe battery, 'long lasting' a special\nmodel.\" era bly as Mr Skanket rolled around him and bent\ndown to open one of the glass cases. He\nreached inside and pulled out a large box from\nmany stacked in a helter-skelter pattern, giving\nthe impression of a monkey's attempt at Tetris.\nHe labour ed the box back across the shop to his\ndesk. The retch shuffled around keeping his\neyes on the proprietor at all times.\n\"Here, this is what 1 have for you\", he said\nshaking the personal computer from its foam\nprison. The man stammered,\n\"I'm not sure you understand me, that's far\ntoo much.\" \"This! This. Too much. Let me show you.\" The old man opened his mouth to protest, then\nclosed it again.\nThe store keeper found the catch and\nopened the lid of the lap top. The thing came on\nwith a bleep. No doubt surprising both men equally. He turned the machine so it faced the\nshrinking customer on the other side of the\ndesk.\n\"Here.\" He read from the box. \"Personal\ncomputerised, Pentium processor, 60 MHz, The man looked away, perhaps\nfor means of escape. He looked at his\nwatch.\n\"For you1200 pounds.\" The\nblotchy man looked down and half\nstepped away.\n\"I really must be going now. Its\nlate and surely you should shut your\nshop.\"\n\"I keep it open for you.1200 pounds. What is wrong? Is it the\nprice?\" But the man dragged himself\naway. \"I must go.\"\n\"Just tell me. You don't like the\nprice?\"\nThe man shuffled a bit. \"It is rather a lot.\"\n\"I tell you what.\" He picked a box of disks\noff the counter. \"I give you these. I throw them\nin. Worth 20 pounds. Buy today. I'm in a good mood. I give you10% off too, \u00a3 1 0 0 0 . How about it?\" The man returned to the counter.\n\"It's really too much. I'm not a wealthy\nman.\" \"Well maybe we can make a deal. It's too\nmuch you say. Your sister like music. See, CD ROM attachment. It can play music.\"\n\"She loves music.\"\n\"You want a CDR OM.I get you one\" He walked purposely across the shop and returned\nwith another box. \" CD ROM normally \u00a3 5 0 0\npounds, with the computer only \u00a3 2 0 0 . \"\nThe customer watched, almost rooted to\nthe spot, while the charade of setting up the\ndisk man took place. Mr Skanket pressed play\nand tinny Strauss floated out of the machine and\nacross the shop. The man was visibly\nimpressed.\n\n"

    "content": "24 June 1998 MUSIC 39\nCLUBSCENE - SINGLES\nSeba. Planetary Funk Alert (Looking\nGood) Out Now\nAnother faultless piece of work\nfrom the Looking Good camp, which is why it's no surprise that\nit's been getting plenty of plays at\nthe Logical Progression parties\n.sending the crowd into a frenzy\neverywhere it's been dropped. Absolutely killer key line in the\nbreak and I can still hear Conrad's lyrics floating over the top, hands in\nthe air stuff. Also featured on Bukem's Progression Sessions mix\nCD. What more need 1 say, this is a must.\nBig Bud. Emotlonography (Good\nLooking) Out Now\nIf you're a fan of previous Big\nBud releases this shouldn't be a disappointment, as it's pretty much\nin the same vein. With those familiar crisp rolling beats, dubbed out\nbassline and dreamy atmosphere-ical s and effects. Another one getting maximum support from LTJ\nhimself, also featured on his mix\nCD. Just adding to the long list of\ninnovative and progressive tracks\nthat is Good Looking Records.\nM.T.S Hard Disk /Revolution remixes (Juice) 13 Jury\nDecoder gets on the mix of\nHard Disk and gives it that distinctive dark, fairly minimal rolling\ntreatment. Clashing beats injecting\nin now and then over the drowning\nbass tones and chopped up rolling\nbeats. But I actually prefer A Sides\nmix of Revolution which feels a little harder, plenty of additional\nbeats thrown in over the main drum\npattern which keeps you interested\nand clever fx and samples give it\nthe finishing touch.\nPrisoners Of Technology. One Two\n- World Cup Mix (Fresh Kuts)\nAnother two strong releases\nfrom P.O.T, but I fail to see what it\nhas to do with the World Cup! They\nkeep surprising me with the consistent quality of the material released\nto date, that fits neatly in between\nJump Up and more Intelligent and\nDark styles. Not a hint of cheese on\neither track, as I keep expecting.\nOne Two is an intelligently made\nfast paced track with clean crisp\nbeats and they show their diversity\nas they dispense with the massive\nbass-line and go with fucked with\neffects. Top marks once again.\nLow Down (Trouble On Vinyl)\nThis latest release has been a while coming, the first since their\nhighly impressive album Code Of\nThe Streets. Echoing bass tones\nsets up the break with eerie effects\nand you expect it to drop like a bomb but it doesn't. Instead it\ncomes back with light, cleverly cut,\nskippy beats that are constantly\nbuilding. Quite minimal really but\nworks very well the way the three\nor so different beat patterns inter-change.\nEmbee. Power (Splash) 6th Jury\nA firm favourite with the likes of\nHype and Grooverider. A hectic\npace is set with Power, loads going\non, rough metallic beats sounding a little like Babylon in the bassline\ndepartment if I'm not mistaken.\nDamage has a wicked intro that\nsounds like a laser pulse being fired\n(Golden Eye N64?) then comes in\nthe broken beats again fast and\nfurious and in an off beat style e. Fellowship. Mombassa / Quartz\n(Creative Source)\nIn a very musical style that\nCreative Source have been championing for some time now, strong\npiano riffs run alongside quite a hard sounding drum pattern with\nlittle stabs of trumpet and flutes.\nDefinitely one for those long su mmer nights ahead. Quartz is a little\nharder and you could be mistaken\nfor thinking it was on Good Looking\nrecords, it's in that sort of style.\nDigital. Express (Creative Source)\nDigital is one of my favourite\nproducers of the moment after a string of wicked releases. This latest offering is pretty minimal, with\nintelligent use of the drum patterns\nbacked up by depth giving effects.\nHis fairly unique tight beats are difficult to explain, so I won't try. If\nyou're looking for something a little\ndifferent, it's well worth checking\nout. Flip-side in a totally different\nstyle reminiscent of one of\nDecoder's dark rollers.\nBreakbeat Era. Breakbeat Era (Full\nCycle/XL) 29 June\nBreakbeat Era are Lennie Laws,\nDJ Die and Roni Size and, as you\nmight expect, all these tracks are\nbreakbeat driven. The original mix\nhas a full song from Lennie Laws,\nwith a double bass. More of a song\nthan a out and out Drum and Bass\ntrack, very well done if you like that\nsort of thing. The Full Cycle mix is\nrather disappointing and feels very\nweak overall. DJ Die mix is my\nfavourite, totally breakbeat driven\nwith double bassline, those full\ncycle style beats. It gets a little\ntinny for me, though.\n1\nGrant Nelson Project. Step 2 Me\n(Swing City)\nOut of the three mixes on offer,\nI'd go for the Future Dub, which\ntotally cuts the vocal down to little\nstabs and starts off with a intro\ntaken from an old Drum and Bass\ntrack, if I'm not mistaken. Slightly\noverwhelming piano that, if it was-n't cut out when it is, would sound\nrather dod gy indeed, but they get\naway with it. Nice scratch taking\nyou back into it. On the first few listens I wasn't convinced by this\ntrack but after repeated listening it\nhas grown on me, yet it still seems\nto lack something. At the risk of\nsounding sexist I'd say this was one\nfor the ladies, especially the full\nvocal and two step mixes that have\na soul diva type of vocal.\nDavis and Sweet. Muzik - Can u Feel It (Weston Village) 3rd Jury\nTitle track Muzik has pretty subtle beats and bass, relying on keys,\neffects and title vocals to get you moving, but feels a little weak and,\ndare I say, boring. It keeps threatening to do something to spark it\noff but never does. But I 've a feeling it's meant to be this way, an\neasy going roller. Destiny is more\nlively due to tougher beats again,\npleasant key interchanges and\ngood mix of the two vocals working\nhand in hand. This one has that little something that grabs your attention and gets you moving.\nPursernel and Sons. Ain't What You\nDo (Swing City) 3 Jury\nSlightly dubious vocal that lets\nthis track down for me, as clever\nbeats and mid bass tones are quite\neffective but always feeling a little\nmainstream for me. But then Swing\nCity do seem to nestle between out\nand out underground garage and\nmore vocal, classic garage. Grant's Deep and Deadly mix has to be my\nfavourite, chunky beats and he\nmanages to make the vocal sound\nall right via cutting the fuck out of it.\nI wouldn't call this a blinding track\nbut it'sO K. The Memzee. Funky Love (Vinyl\nDistribution) Out Now\nThis has to be one of the best\ntracks I 've had sent through this\nyear and I haven't stopped playing\nit. And I actually prefer the vocal\nmix to the dub (that is a first), with\nthe amazing vocal talents of The\nMem zee are unreal. Right up there\nwith Roy Davis Jnr's Gabrielle for\nvocal content but much more dance able and club friendly. Not so\nmuch tuff beats but percussion and\noff key piano tones get you gro ov ing. Wicked track perfect for the\nsummer months ahead.\nPob. Boiler (Platipus) Out Soon\nThis hard in your face tech-house sort of stuff, with trance y tinges and contains all your\nfavourite animal sounds, honestly it\ndoes. Getting plenty of support\nfrom the likes of Sasha, Oakenfold\nand Nick Warren to mention but a few. it's deep, hard, trip py and well\nput together: all in all a fierce track.\nAlso a remix by Humate, who mini-malis es the beats action and darkens it up some in a typical German\ntrance y style.\nConscious. Northern Lights\n(Platipus) Out Soon\nOriginal mix has massive intro\nof atmosphere ical s, effects, bird\ncalls - very deep and dreamy then\neventually the bass drum rolls in\nwith skippy percussion lines. A pleasant trance y number in a rolling\nfashion. Pod mix is hard house bordering on funky Techno, starts off\nwith jungle animal sounds. Squelchey beats and a driven bass\ndrum accompanied by wobbly acid\nsounds that mess with your mind\nas it keeps building. Sure to keep\nany floor pumping.\nDon't forget all the singles featured here are based on12\" Vinyl\nnot CD releases and many will only\nbe available in small independent\nrecords shops not the large chain\nstores. Also the release dates are\njust a rough guide as many are put\nback, brought forward etc. Even\nthough this is often the case there\nare always a few promo copies\nfloating around well before official\nrelease dates.\nJo Public.\n\n"

The new system will replace the even digits,\nincluding even digits in decimal\nnumbers, with the Greek letter\nlambda (X). The ruling does not yet\ncover 0, but this is likely to be\nincluded in the next wave during\nthe summer. Thus the old digits 2,\n4, 6, 8 will all be replaced by X,X,X,X. The decision comes after\nImperial again made a loss in the\n2nd quarter. IC's share price fell by\nalmost 20% as confidence in the\ncollege fell. This was compounded\nby a rise in cost by the suppliers -student prices have gone up by\n\u00a33.45 per kilogram over the past 3\nmonths and prices are still rising.\nThe ICHC is considering only purchasing 85% of the normal intake in\nthe coming year.\nIt is estimated that 15% of all\nImperial's academic spending (3%\nof total spending) is on the use of\neven numbers.

The Maths Department, represented by Mr C Broker of\nSherfield, said \"We are really\npleased with the move, as it will\nreduce our workload by X0%\".\nThere was also a positive reception\nfrom the Mechanical Engineering\ndepartment, represented by Mr C Broker from Sherfield, who said\n\"This is great as all our plans automatically convert themselves from\nimperial units to metric... those\nmetric units always puzzled us\". Mr\nC Broker, speaking on behalf of the\nComputing Department, commented \"We only use zeros and ones\nanyway\".\nHowever, despite the move\nbeing officially approved by the\ndepartments, there has been some\ncriticism by the Union. Miss D Foster standing in for Mr C Broker\nsaid \"This is a big blow both for the\nUnion and for students generally.\nStudent grants have now\ndecreased by XXX. This will hit the\nstudents hard. Where...\" Mr C Broker returned to relieve Miss D Foster and carried on \"The Union is\ndelighted by the decision and will\nsupport ICHC all the way.\"\nNEWS FEATURE\nSheep Maintenance Failing\nBritain has a long and proud history\nin sheep maintenance. As recently\nas 1968, the world-leading companies were all based in the UK. Yet\nforeign competition has caused the\npractice to all but die out. Ross\nNewell investigates...\nBritain lags behind the world in\nmany ways, but none more so than\nthe vital area of Sheep\nMaintenance. Britain, one of the\npioneers of this important area, has\nneglected it for too long.\nSheep Maintenance in Britain\nhas a long history. The\nFundamental Principle of Sheep\nMaintenance was developed at\nCambridge University by Sir Milford\nHaven in 1902. Then in the 1970s, when the world had all but forgotten Shep Main, Margaret Terrace of\nImperial College laid down the\nfoundations for modern Shep Main\nwhen she developed the now legendary Terrace equation.\nShortly after this, however,\nfunding for Shep Main in Britain all\nbut disappeared. Why is it that\nwhen Shep Main started to break\neven, Britain ignored it? Why did\nBritain look the other way when\nShep Main could be seen to be a serious commercial venture? It\ncomes down to pride; the British\npeople think they are too good for\nlowly Shep Main. Government and\nBusinesses see Shep Main as an\nindustry for inferior countries, but\ncan we afford to ignore an industry\nwith a turnover of \u00a3350 brill ion per\nannum?\nPrejudice is not confined to\ngovernment and commercial inter-est s; indeed, here at Imperial, a Thanks to cuts and under funding, even prize young specimens like\nthese are being left to suffer rust-ing, exhaust problems and\ninfrequent oil changes\nplace renowned for scientific indifference (you know what I mean),\nthere is Shep Main prejudice. One\nneed only look at Imperial's accounts to see that the Shep Main\ndepartment is seriously under fund ed. The budget for IC Shep Main\nthis year is only \u00a34.32 and a McDonald's voucher, whereas\nPrinceton USA Shep Main has a budget of \u00a325.3 quill ion and its\nown nuclear power station. We are\nseeing the best British Shep Main\nstudents head-hunted by foreign\nuniversities. How are we supposed\nto compete with Barcelona, whose\nShep Main Dept has a missile\nlaunch centre and two Cray super-computers, when our own has only\na box of soggy fireworks and a Commodore 64 with a broken 't' key?\nThe under investment in Britain\nis not confined to Imperial,\nCambridge Shep Main has an\nequally small budget and is forced\nto use a bus shelter to lecture 1st year students. This problem is\ncompounded by Simon Baker, who\nuses the shelter to teach 40 five\nyear olds to read using yesterday's copy of the Sun. Oxford Shep\nMain, among others, has been\ntaken over by the mafia to be used\nas a money laundering business.\nThis is one of the problems the\ngovernment should by tackling\nhead on. Will we stand aside and\nlet our ailing Shep Main industry\ncollapse or will we stand up and\nfight back? The British Shep Main\nindustry needs your help.\nYou must stand up and say that\nyou appreciate their work. You\nmust buy British, even though\nJapan makes higher quality products at lower prices, you must support the British economy. There is\nstill time to put Britain at the top of\nthe pack again, but time is running\nout fast and the competition is\nstrong.\nBriefly...\nNEW MASCOT\nANNOUNCED\nA new College initiative has\nnamed serial killer Bob Goodwin\n(34) as the new unified college\nmascot. He will replace all the\nCCU mascots to reduce costs.\nBob will attend college events\nsuch as inter-university football\ngames and University Challenge\nmatches. He will offer moral\nsupport, encouragement and\nwill execute any member of the\nenemy/opposition who causes\nan obstacle to IC's team's domination of the game/match/\nworld.\nThese rules are due to come\ninto effect at the start of next\nterm, but there is still time to\nobject to the proposals. Future\ncuts oh the cards include a reduction in the number of\nallowable dimensions on cam-pus, revoking Newton's2 nd and 3rd laws, and eventual\nrelocation to Inverness of all\nnon-critical (academic) depart-ment s. FOUL STENCH\nAcademic research was severely\naffected on Friday, as a noxious\naroma drifted over the entirety\nof the South Kensington, cam-pus. Initially, it was believed\nthat the odour emanated from\nthe Chemistry department,\nwhere certain members are\nengaged in research into non-aromatic he tere o cycles, but this\nproved to be false when the real\nsource of the smell was found\nto be the RCSU office. When\nquestioned about the odour,\nofficers denied that it was their\nfault, claiming that the recent\nspell of hot weather had caused\nthe sewer system to overload.\nWhen pressed, however, they\ndid admit to not having changed\ntheir clothes for the past two\nand a half years. Disgusted,\nSecurity closed the office, and\nbegan fumigation procedures.\nThe offending parties were sent\nto St Mary's Hospital to have\ntheir clothes surgically removed\nand incinerated. Helen-Louise\nWindsor is 35.\n\n"

She sees the\nopportunity of writing Mama's biography as a means of making\nmoney and restoring her reputation to its former glory. As Janie\ninvestigates Mama's background,\ndiscrepancies begin to emerge in\nthe offical version of Mama's history and Janie has to chose\nwhether to listen to her instincts\nand uncover the real story or not.\nBernstein's strength is her ability to create believable characters\nand then develop those characters\nthroughout the novel, using flashbacks to keep the reader interest-ed. On the whole this is a very\ngood book, the kind to take on holiday to read on the beach. If\nthat was the case I would happily\nfork out the money for it but if not,\nthis is the kind of book I would\nenjoy taking out of the library.\nPublished by: Bantam Books.\nOut now\nBITCH\nBITCH\nElizabeth Wurtzel\nA lot of people (men) will buy this\nbook simply for the picture of the\nnaked woman on the front. They\nwill then read it, and discover that\nBitch does not refer to a stripper\nwith a penchant for doing it\n\"doggy style\", but to the state of\nwomen today. Elizabeth Wurtzel\ntakes hundreds of examples of\nwomen who have suffered and\npresents them to us in this lucid\ncollection of essays on modern\nwomen. She reminds us of the\npain felt by poets such as Sylvia\nPlath and Annie Sexton, of the terror faced by Nicole Brown Simpson, and celebrates some of\nthe most infamous women in his-tory, defending their outsize\ndesires, describing their exquisite\nloneliness, championing their take-no-prisoners approach to life and\nto love.\nThanks to their past sufferings,\nthis is the first time in history that\na woman can exist as a viable entity without the support of a man.\nHooray for feminism and down with the r otters, they're all bas-tard s. A good book to read and\nthen talk about. At length. Loudly.\nNot for the boys though.\nPublished by: Quartet. Out now\nIMAGININGS\nOF SAND\nAndre Brink\nN 'kosi si kele l'i Afrika. The lead-up\nto the birth of the New South\nAfrica was nothing if not traumatic.\nCountless people, both black and\nwhite, were killed in violent attacks\non humanity and property. The\ntension mounted as many of the\nold-style Afrikaners refused to\nabandon their long held traditions.\nThe men in particular felt a great-deal of resentment towards the\nchanges and towards the emerging\ngovernment. Despite the changes\nbeing obvious to everyone in the\nworld, many denied that the black\nGovernment would win. Back into\nthis claustrophobic society came\nKristien, to care for her dying\ngrandmother and to absorb her\nmemories of their family history.\nEleven years had passed since she\nran away to England to escape her\nfuture, and she hadn't been back\nsince. The book charts her acceptance of her family and her history.\nThis book is amazing. The story\nflows in an almost romantic way:\nthe stories of the vel t fit beautifully\nalongside the tensions of contemporary South Africa. Reading it\nmade me feel as if I was back in\nthe least tolerant and the most\nbeautiful country in the world. Buy\nit, read it, love it. God bless Africa.\nPublished by: Random House.\nOut now\nlilt!* NAMEDROPPER\nEmma Forrest\nI 've done the teen thing. It was fun\nwhile it lasted, but was not an\nexperience I'd like to relive, so\nreading this book about a self-pro-claimed iconic sixteen year old was\nnot always a pleasant experience.\nViva Cohen has a blissful life\nwith her uncle, her lettuce-chewing\nbest friend, her favourite song and\nher Elizabeth Taylor posters. After\nthe summer, she has a lot of\nElizabeth Taylor posters. Whenever\nher life goes wrong, she turns to\nher Marilyn Monroe or Audrey\nHepburn posters for comfort and\ncries along to \"The Boys of\nSummer\" by Don Henley. She's also a neurotic, paranoid, spoilt\nbrat, who prefers to be thought of\nas an icon, rather than to do anything to merit it. She dreams of\nhow she'd commit suicide, has a distaste for sex, (although she\nnever really gets any offers), travels to America with her slightly\nsuccessful rockstar friend and generally daydreams her way through\nlife, until she's brought down to\nEarth with a bump.\nThe book is funny and quite\ntouching in parts, good but not\ngreat, and an enjoyable read whilst\nbored.\nPublished by: Arrow Books.\nSAINTS& SI IN J INI E.t^S "

Followed closely by the Antipodeans, Americans and of course\nthe Germans, albeit for entirely different rea-sons, we are the Kings of the Effluent Treatment\nCentre and little else.\nMy problem is that I don't actually enjoy being\nEnglish. Yes I know that 1 can say this from the\ncomfort of my own desk having had a privileged\nup-bringing, wanting for nothing, cocooned in\nthe wealth and smugness that is for ever Great\nBritain (and who else would have the arrogance\nto prefix thus). But that IS my problem you see,\nfor now, when travelling abroad I find myself\noverly sensitive to the beliefs and traditions of\nthe country to which I have journeyed. It has got\nto the point where rather than speak English,\nslowly and loudly of course, I will remain mute\nuntil I have sufficient grasp of a language to at\nleast order some food, which has led to near\nsevere bouts of malnutrition. Not good for one who' s natural demean our is that of an stick\ninsect, and in retrospect probably more ignorant\nthan if I were to use my native tongue, but there\nit is, my problem, mine to deal with.\nSo obviously when travelling to a country like\nThailand swathed in the mysteries of Buddhism\nand a language untouched by anything remotely Roman it is not without a little trepidation.\nHowever armed with my \"Rough Guide\" and my \"Culture Shock\" I can but endeavour to be more\nthan just another Brit abroad.\nii \u2022:\n: Settled* in at Lew Thai ^ie^th oi^ se.

This particular little old lady, a cross between Aunt Flo and the child catcher\nwould delight in whipping the spoon out of my hand during pudding, stand over me( her hot fetid\nbreath on my neck being the only thing stopping\nme from dissolving in a pool of chilled sweat), and\nmake me spoon custard with my right hand.

This was the culture shock I hadn't been\nwarned about. Every don'ton my list was being\nflaunted openly. My first meal came with a knife\nand an over-inflated bill, whilst the couple next\nto me sucked each others tonsils, she narrowly\nfailing to stay in her bikini. I longed once again\nto be back in Thailand, proper Thailand that is,\nwhere I could put my fork in my mouth or touch\nmy partner's foot and feel guilty about it. Where\npeople would laugh at my abysmal attempts at\na foreign language, where I wouldn't feel like I had arrived in Blackpool in the high season and\nit was then that I saw the light, a genius stroke,\na master plan.\nNationalise the whole fucking Island.\nTreble the already trebled prices. Make the fat,\nflabby white puffy ignorant English, Germans,\nAustralians, South Africans et al pay through the\nnose. Confiscate their passports and if they\nwant to get off the Island then they must earn\nthe right to. Make them learn the list of DON'Ts\nforfeiting any entitlement to leave until they do. The money would come pouring in, the baht\nwould once more return to the heady days\nbefore the crash and the money could be used\nto supplement the income of the people in the\nGolden Triangle now being deprived the right to harvest the poppy seed, consequently forcing\nthem into Chiang Mai to beg on the streets.

I'm so sorry.\"\n\"Sure, sure, let me help you with these.\"\nThe storekeeper piled the equipment back\nin its boxes, remembering the disks but forgetting to put the disc man in. He handed Mr Locker the pile and bundled him out towards\nthe door.\nSo when Mr Locker left the shop. Laden so\nhigh with boxes he could hardly see the path he\nwalking on. He was wearing a strange smile, a look even of deep satisfaction. Perhaps it was\nbrought on by a sudden infusion of Yule tide\nspirit, or perhaps the simple pleasure of seeing\nchildren play brought back memories of his\nyouth. But had Mr Skanket seen it he would\nhave detected something else there, something\nelse entirely.\nThe ball whistled through the air and hit Mr Locker squarely on the top of his bald head.\nBut he always knew it, like the cheque,\nwould bounce.\nff wt' s all a complete disaster.\" I'm bel-j lowing hysterically down the phone.\nBridget's conciliatory. \"Its not that bad.\nNothing that happens to you it is THAT bad.\"\n\"It is.

    "content": "24 June 1998 ARTS 51\nDANCING GALLERIES\nALAIN PLATEL'S LES BALLETS C DE LA B: LETS OP BACH\nQueen Elizabeth Hall\nA few weeks ago 1 wrote\nabout the exciting dance\nseason in London and gave\na little advice on the best companies to go and see. One of these\nwas Alain Platel's Les Ballets C de la\nB, from Ghent in Belgium.\nHe was over here in May last\nyear with his work La Tristeza\nComplice: one of the most incredible things 1 have ever seen. It had\nan amazing success all over\nEurope. Dance fans have been\neagerly expecting his latest offer-ing. Well, this is no disappoint-ment, in fact it goes a step further\nthan La Tristeza Complice.\nIt's called Lets op Bach. It's in\nthe same vein with a mix of all sorts\nof arts: Bach's music played by a group of eight musicians, three\nopera singers, the dancers of\ncourse and the odd circus number\ntoo.\nThe scene takes place in some\nkind of garden with chairs, a paddling pool, sun beds on the roof of\nthe house...a very down to earth,\nsimple surrounding. The small\norchestra mark the beginning by\nplaying a very emotional piece creating a very palpable sense of\nbeauty and serenity. As they finish,\nthe chaos starts: the dancers\nappear, all in different shapes,\ncolours and ages along with two\ncute little girls. From then on and\nuntil the end, Alain Platel stages\nlife: the interactions between\nhuman beings, life in a group,\nfriendships, and relationships.\nThere is such a strong sense of passion in this guy's work. The emotion is so present in the way the\ndancers move: they are complete\nactors. I have rarely seen such fascinating performers. They seem to\nbe suffering in their own souls. The\nscenes, at times, are hilarious, for\nexample when they all start dancing on \"One of us\" sung by Prince,\nled by a very tall black man in drag.\nAlthough comic is never far away, it\nalways depicts the saddest things,\nthe desperation these people are\nfeeling, the lack of communication,\nthe loneliness. Platel shows life as it\nis: an endless isolated struggle. At\none point, the four women end up\nscreaming political slogans at the\naudience, with a very funny reference to Kofi Annan, before letting a little girl say: \"yo quiero a todo el\nmundo\". (I love everyone)\nThe dancers are absolutely per-fec t, the ideas in the choreography\nso inventive. The singing and music\nwork very well with this. Platel has\ncreated a piece with extraordinary\nimpact, both visually and emotionally making us laugh and cry, watch\nin disgust and admiration. He is a true artist, one of that rare kind, like\nMaurice Bejart, who can make\ndance exciting and innovative,\nwithin our context, yet giving his\nideas such space to breathe and to\nmature. If you weren't there last\nweek, then do look out for Platel's next visit to London. This is not\npretentious and inaccessible art.\nAnyone with a taste for something\na little different will love it.\nD. THE CANON PHOTOGRAPHY GALLERY\nThe Victoria & Albert Museum\nIn all their leaflets, the V&A have\nbeen saying they own \"one of\nthe finest collections if the art\nphotography in the world\". So\noff 1 went to check this big statement out. My expectations were\nvery high and I had imagined I was\ngoing to see the most breathtaking\ndisplay of photos I had ever seen.\nWell I must admit that I was a little disappointed by the whole\nthing, although there is some great\nart on show. The gallery follows the\nfirst steps of photography as early\nas 1839 up to the latest cutting\nedge ideas by artists such as Adam\nFuss. The \"New Art\"\" room exposes the two major photographic\ninventions: the French Daguerreotype, an image on polished metal\nand the English counterpart, which\nwas to become photography as we\nknow it (with the idea of a \"nega-ti ve\"). The first steps seem to be\nquite focused on landscapes and\nbuildings and then quite a few pictures of the colonies, mainly India.\nThe interests of the Victorian era....\nAs we progress in time, the\nsubject gets more interesting and\nfamous names like Carrier-Besson,\nMan Ray and Bill Brandt begin to\nappear developing very personal\nthemes with apparition of the\nmodel as object of beauty and way\nof experimenting (a beautiful portrait of Lee Miller). The pre-war\ndays also bring a more political\naspect to photography, with pictures of Africa This has continued\nto be one of the many faces of this\nart: there is a very emotional photo\nof a black girl and a white boy\ntogether in South Africa taken in\n1964 by David Goldblatt.\nThe 70's go even further into\nthe experimental vein with an\namazing portrait of Francis Bacon\nby John Deakin. It is also time for\nfurther explorations into fashion\nwith people like David Bailey. In the\nlast rooms of the exhibition, the\nV&A seems to have concentrated\nmore on the odd and wonderful\nthings made in the past decade.\nThey have recreated for us Helen\nChadwick's \"The Oval Court\". It is\nextremely interesting to look at,\nvery different but quite powerful.\nUsing a Canon photocopier, she\nhas made a cycle out of several\nself-portraits in different positions,\nincluding little animals and fruit. It\nfeels likes her interpretation of\nwhat it is to be a woman. Finally,\nwe are offered some of the most\nrecent ideas in photography,\nincluding a return to the sources by\nAdam Fuss. He uses primary techniques with a20 th century twist to\nit. David Hockney demonstrates\nthe possibilities of mixing photography and painting and there are a few other original things there.\nI seem to have now convinced\nmyself, after all, that this gallery is\nvery good. 1 thought there would\nbe much more. There will be nothing new for most people but it's still\nnice to have 140 years of photography in such a small place. This is\na great addition to the art scene in\nLondon and we can only hope\nthere will be plenty more later.\nD. MATERIAL\nWORLD\nScience Museum\nate rials may sound like\nJ%#1 the most boring course\nI^/1 on Earth and one can\nonly take so much talk about concrete from Civil Engineers but the\nlatest exhibition in the Science\nMuseum is of genuine relevance to\nevery degree discipline. On show\nare some stunning examples of\nhaute couture using the latest artificial materials, including a dress\nmade from a plastic with the properties of paper, part of a collection\ncommissioned for Bjork. Motorbike fiends will be surprised to see\nthe racing leathers that protected\nCarl Fogarty from a1 OOmph crash\nduring the World Super Bike trials,\nthough you do need to look closely to spot the scuffing. Perhaps the\nmost visually striking exhibit, which\nwill make it into the next edition of\nthe Guinness Book of Records, is a giant molecular model of diamond.\nIt is intriguing that as you change\nviewing angle, moire patterns play\nover the surface, more a work of\nart than science. Finally, I truly\nhope that the touchy-feel y exhibit,\ngiving comparisons between natural and man made materials, does-n't get the animal rights lobby too\nexcited. It only looks like three\notters worth C\\ Peter R.H. "

    "content": "24 June 1998 NEWS\nNews in Brief...\nTO PAY OR NOT\nTO PAY? ;\nThe start of next term sees the\nintroduction of tuition fees, with\nan estimated one third of students paying \u00a3 1,000 per year for\ntheir education. Current surveys\nsuggest that most would-be students are in the dark concerning\nhow the fees will affect them, and\nhow much they will have to pay.\nDespite government assurances\nthat the fees will be means-test-ed, their own figures indicate that\nstudent numbers could drop in\nthe next few years as parents are\nreluctant to pay the fees. The\nNUS has estimated that universities could be left with \u00a331 million\nper year of unpaid fees, which\nbegs the question what will universities do with students who\nrefuse to pay?\nOxford University made clear\nits position on this subject last\nweek. In plans that are bound to\nupset students, the University has\ndeclared that it will expel anyone\nwho fails to pay before the end of\nthe first term. Such students will\nbe denied all access to the\nUniversity until they have paid off\ntheir debt. Other universities can\nbe expected to take a similar\nstance, although Imperial's position on the matter was unknown\nat the time Felix went to press.\nMIN WAGE\nMUM Britain is to have a minimum\nwage, starting in April 1999. Last\nweek the government accepted\nrecommendations from the Low\nPay Commission to set the minimum wage at \u00a33.60 per hour.\nThe rate for 18 to 21 year olds will\nbe lower, however, starting at\n\u00a33.00 and rising to \u00a33.20 in June\n2000. Under 18s will not be covered by the minimum wage.\nThe announcement of a minimum wage brings Britain in line\nwith other European countries,\nmost of whom have higher minimum rates of pay. There are also\nno plans to link Britain's minimum\nwage to inflation, so its actual\nvalue is likely to decline over time.\nMargaret Beckett, President of\nthe Board of Trade, has denied\nthat the minimum wage is a watered-down version of the gov-ern ment' s manifesto pledge: In\nthe House of Commons she\nclaimed that it would help two\nmillion workers escape from\n\"poverty pay\".\nThe Conservative Opposition\nhas criticised the concept of a minimum wage: Speaking in the\nCommons, John Redwood,\nShadow President of the Board of\nTrade, claimed that \"a minimum\nwage policy will not work\".\nBefore the announcement was\nmade many small businesses\nwere worried that a minimum\nwage would damage their\nprospects, but the \u00a33.60 level is\nmuch lower than many expected.\nWorkers' unions had pressed for\nover one pound more an hour,\nand many feel betrayed by New\nLabour. Business groups, how ev er, have accepted the pay level as\nreasonable.\nMOD LIKES A BIT\nA defence establishment in\nWorcestershire has become the\nlatest company to discover its\nemployees are using computers\nat work to download pornography\nfrom the internet. More than\n170,000 images were allegedly\nfound during routine security\nchecks on computer systems at\nthe Defence Evaluation and\nResearch Agency. The agency is\nresponsible for developing battlefield technology for the Ministry\nof Defence: One computer, supposed to be used to communicate with defence experts around\nthe world, was found to have\nspent 70% of its last three weeks'\nonline time downloading images.\nThe issue is almost certainly\ngoing to be raised in parliament\nthis week, with internet pornography already being a topical political talking point. With the internet now a regular feature of most\noffices, and the number of pornographic or otherwise dubious\nwebsites rising, it is felt that legal\nsafeguards must be put in place.\nThe problem of how to regulate\nan international network comprised of millions of computers\nhas yet to be satisfactorily\nanswered.\nIC Win UL Cricket\nCup - Or Do They?\nJEREMY THOMSON\nIC's cricket first team returned victorious from Motspur Park last\nTuesday, after beating Royal\nHolloway by four wickets to take\nthe University of London League\nCup.\nHowever, they are now facing\ndisqualification\nafter a complaint from the\nRoyal Holloway team\nthat they had\nfielded ringers\nin the final.\nThe controversy is centred\non 1C batsman\nImran Khan,\nwho opened\nplay but was bowled out for just\none run. Mr Khan is a medical student and, according to Royal\nHolloway, is not eligible to play in\nthe Imperial College team, despite\nthe fact St Mary's did not field a team this year.\nThe University of London Union\ndoes not yet recognise ICSM as\npart of Imperial College, although\nfrom next year medical students\nwill be able to play for IC teams\nwhere there is no alternative. As\nthe situation is not clear, a ULU\ncommittee will meet to examine\nthe rules of the league.\nCharlie Joynt, DP(C&5), said\nthat the situation is \"ridiculous\".\n\"He [lmr an Khan] has been playing\nfor three or four years, and they've\nnever complained before.\"\nAndy Heeps,\nICU President,\nwent further;\n\"It's typical of\nbloody ULU\", he\nsaid, \"as far as\nI'm concerned,\nwe're keeping\nthe cup.\"\nIn a recent\ndevelopment, it\nhas now been revealed that Mr\nKhan's performance in a previous\nmatch may have been more influential. Apparently, a score of forty\nwhile playing for the IC second\nteam could have prevented an all-Holloway final.\nFor a report of the match, see\npage 58\n\u00a32.5m Motspur Sale\nDAVID ROBERTS\nThe final meeting of the year for\nUniversity of London Union Council\nsaw the sale of Motspur Park, the\nULU sports ground and one of the\nUnion's biggest assets.\nThe sale has been in negotiations all year, ever since the first\noffers for the ground were received\nby the Union. Both Fulham FC and\nChelsea FC, who wish to use the\nground as a training facility, submitted bids well above the valuation made by the University.\nHowever, the offer from Fulham\n(owned by Harrods boss\nMohammed al Fayed) has been\nviewed as more favourable by the\nUnion's negotiators - importantly,\nFulham pledge to ensure no reduction in student usage of the site.\nConsequently, whilst the Union\nstands to profit to the tune of \u00a322.5 million from the sale, and save\nup to \u00a395,000 on annual maintenance charges, a rental charge of\njust \u00a35000 a year should see no\nchange in student activity at the\nsite.\nThe meeting questioned the\nproposal at length, expressing concern at the long tern implications of\nthe sale. However, a guarantee of a percentage of any profits generated by a further sale of the ground\nwithin the next twenty years\nappeased those present. The\nPresident of ULU, Siva\nGaneshanedan, also promised that\nall proceeds from the sale will be\nset aside to fund a new sports facility, which will probably be a new\nsports hall in the Bloomsbury area.\nA vote on the proposal gave the\ngo-ahead to Mr Ganeshanedan to\nfinal is e details of the sale.\nContracts should be completed\nand signed by the end of the sum-mer, so that the deal can be completed in time for the new academic year.\n\n"

    "content": "24 June 1998 COLUMNS 12\ne fore we get started, I'm afraid it's necessary to mention a few basic points of\nbar etiquette. Firstly, what do you\ndo if you knock over another\nchap's pint? Two possibilities- 'oh,\ndid that have beer in it,' said after\nobserving an enormous brown\npuddle on the floor. This is not cor-rect. The proper response is 'I'm very sorry, let me get you another\none.' Secondly, the playing of\ndrums in Southside TV lounge\nwhile members of the human race\nare attempting to follow a World\nCup game is not recommended. I shall say no more.\nStart spreading the news, I'm leaving today. Well, not exactly,\nsince I have been refused parole\nagain, but the dubious application\nof Ol' Blue Eyes' lyrics have\nbecome a bit of a tradition in this\ncolumn. Given that the great man\nis now playing the biggest venue of\nthem all, I could not resist. For\nmany of you, this will be the last\nFelix you read before you are cast\ninto the cultural wilderness that is\nthe real world. Some of you, now I come to think of it, started at\nbroadly the same time as this col-um n, affording you a glimpse of\nImperial College life denied to your\npredecessors. Ah well, can't win\n'em all.\nThis year has been fairly eventful for Imperial, containing low\npoints and lower points. Ooh, such\ncynicism is one so young. Only j ok ing. This year has been marked by\na few big successes, none more so\nthan the second position of IC in\nthe Financial Times University sur-vey, and first position of Southside\nBar in the inter-bar boat race. If\none wishes to demonstrate the\nchanges that have occurred at\nImperial, one need look no further\nthan the BMS. Regular readers will\nknow that I have been scathing\nabout this project in its early\nstages, but as time has gone on, it\nhas come together very success-fully. Not perfectly, however, as\nthe Rector has said in this issue,\nbut 1 must say that compared to\nmost building projects at IC, this\none has gone like clockwork. The\nbuilding itself, which I visited last\nweek (thanks again to Phil Hilton\nand Ollie Clarke of Schal), is quite\nsuperb and utterly wasted on\nmedics, who, as new members of\nthe College, would be far better\nserved by occupying a building\nsteeped in the glorious history of\nImperial, such as the neighbouring\nChemistry department. As for the\nbiologists, so used to cramped,\ndecaying facilities, they will more\nlikely than not be forced to wear\nslippers for fear of dirtying the\ncarpet.\nSo often these large projects\nsuffer from continual compromise\nthat eats away at the intended\nimprovement of facilities, but in\nthis case attention to detail is\nclear. Though I have obviously not\nseen the facilities intended for\nSnow White, her seven dwarves\nwill be delighted with their toilets,\nparticularly the loo roll dispensers\nthat are six inches off the deck.\nStranger still is the uncanny resemblance to the Southside toilets. If\nSir Norman Foster popped in for a jar, the least he could have done\nwas stand a round or two.\nhence the recent second election\nfor DP F&S( bloody acronyms-they've got me doing it as well)\ncaused by perceived academic\nweakness. This is happening far\ntoo often, though I see little solution beyond seeking academic references for candidates. However, I shudder to think what this could\nlead to. A far bigger problem is the\nconstituency from which most\ncandidates emanate, namely the\nUnion itself. This year has been a little different, and it is good to get\npeople with a fresh approach,\nunburdened by years of hacker y, though this is not to say that some\nof ICU's golden children have gone\non to make great sabbaticals. At\nthis rate, I should be able to get the\nbacks up of everyone by the end of\nthe article...\nTO\nCQ\nCOE lo\n00\ni \u00a3>'\nZ5\nO=1? The Union has proved, as ever,\nto be a fairly eventful place. The\ncarnivals have been very good, the\nbeer has been very bad (stick to\nthe Guinness, which is not bad at\nall) and the elections have been\nheld at a rate that would give an\nItalian returning officer work-rel at ed stress. When we finally elected\nAndy Heeps, we got a very safe\npair of hands to continue the\nexcellent work of Eric Allsop.\nSherfield were delighted when a medic won, since it made the\nmerger that little bit easier, but\nmany of us, myself included, were\na bit wary. Fortunately we have\nbeen proved wrong. Andy has not\ndisplayed the small mindedness\nand chid li sh insularity that characterises so many of his medical colleagues and is perfectly illustrated\nin the block votes. Hopefully the\npresence of a medic at the high\naltar will also help to bring the new\nBMS intake into the fold next term.\nWhile we have certainly had fewer\nelections than last year, the\nprocess has gone without a hitch.\n... which brings me neatly to\nSherfield. I sometimes worry that\nthis obsessive interest is unique to\nme, yet it is the topic that those\npeople who still talk to me mention the most. From the point of\nview of a humble word smith, that\nbuilding is a godsend. Have you\nany idea how hard it would be to\ncraft 500 words of purple prose\n(no sniggering at the back) every\nweek without that lot? They're not\nall bad, of course, but some of\nthem do give the impression of\npausing mid sentence purely to\nchange foot in mouth. All this leads\nsome to say I am out to rubbish\nImperial at every opportunity. Not\nso. If I truly did not give a toss\nabout IC, I wouldn't be here in the\nfirst place. Though parts of IC are\nrun well, many areas are managed\nin a way that is detrimental to the\nstudents, the staff and the College\nitself. Quite why we tolerate such\npractices in non-academic departments in an elitist institution has\nalways been a mystery. The problem with many of the denizens of\nSherfield is that while they are\nthey are not stupid. Making mud\nstick on a department made of\nTeflon is not easy, and even Felix\noccasionally gets it a little wrong.\nThe Conference Office springs to\nmind, but I can say no more\nbecause on one hand my solicitor\nis on holiday and also I have\nbooked a room in Evelyn Gardens\nthis summer. Therefore I better say\nhow marvellous the staff are in that\ndepartment. They know where I live.\nOutside College, it has been a funny old year. There is too much\nchange. Ginger Spice has left. Barry\nNorman has sold out to Sky, and\nthe House of Lords is the subject\nof a bizarre and deeply unwise\nreform. New Labour plods on,\nbecoming more sanctimonious\nand less like the dream that so\nmany endorsed. Against this back-drop, strong opposition is essen-ti al. The Conservatives, after an\nunderstandably shaky start after 18\nyears on the other side of the\nHouse, are now taking Labour to\ntask in an effective manner.\nCometh the hour, cometh the\nman. Though she has only been in\nthe job a week or so, Ann\nWiddecombe is already proving\nher self to be am j or thorn in the\nside of the Cabinet. This woman\nscares Michael Howard, so what\nchance does Blair have. 1 quite\nexpected that Tony Blair would\nhave the decency to announce the\nCabinet reshuffle before this article\nso I could rubbish it, but that's politicians for you.\nSo much to say and so little\nspace. No time to review the art\n'exhibitions', not even time to\nremind those of you who forgot to\nget out of bed this year to sample\nthe exquisite beer in Southside\nThat's pretty much the long and\nthe short of it. I 've enjoyed this\nyear, and I hope that I have provided something to amuse and\ninfuriate you. Going by the Felix\npost bag, I suspect the latter, but\nyou know what Oscar Wilde said\non being talked about. Farewell,\nmes amis, be you staff, student or\neven Director of Estates. As for\nnext year, who knows? All I do\nknow is that next year's editor is a Titan among men, blessed with\nexceptional judgment and s a voir faire. Another beer, Ed?\nLadies and Gentlemen, Simon\nBaker has been put back in his box\n- Ed.\n\n"

    "content": "24 June 1998 FILM 47\nTHE BIG SUMMER PREVIEW\nARMAGEDDON\nStars: Bruce Willis, Steve Buscemi,\nLiv Tyler, Ben Affleck\nDirector: Michael Bay\nWhen: October\nAs far as pointless action and\nviolence is concerned, this is\nthe big one. Jerry\nBruckheimer, producer of The\nRock, Con Air, Top Gun, Crimson\nTide and a hundred-and-one other\nadrenaline ride movies, teams up\nwith The Rock director Bay to bring\nyou the undoubted winner of\n\"Stupidest movie of the year,\n1998\".\nIn a chain of events suspiciously similar to Mimi Leder's Deep\nImpact, scientists spot a meteor\nheading toward earth, threatening\nto obliterate mankind. Queue deep\nminers Bruce Willis and Steve\nBuscemi climbing aboard a space\nshuttle strapped to a nuclear mis-s ile, to show a lump of rock the\nsize of Texas that America's the\nboss.\nOf course, with no previous\ntraining as astronauts, these guys\nare going to have to be pretty heroic - but with an all star cast led by\nBruce Willis, Steve Buscemi, Liv\nTyler (somewhat bizzar ely cast as\nWillis' wife), current hot talent Ben\nAffleck and a host of other familiar\nfaces, how could they possibly fail?\nThis being a Bruckheimer pic-ture, however, what really matters\nis the effects, and with a$100 million budget combined with a plot\nwhich allows for mass devastation\nand an H bomb strapped to billion\ndollars of space hardware, how can\nArmageddon be anything less than\njaw dropping?\nObviously, if you're one of\nthose weirdos who doesn't think\nninety minutes of death, destruction and mindless violence is worth\nthe price of admission, then you\nshould avoid Armageddon like the\nplague. But then you'd be missing\nout on the real point of summer\nreleases - escapist entertainment,\nexplosions and a complete\nabsence of plot. After all, what's the point of summer if you're not\ngoing to relax and enjoy yourself?\nSIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS\nStars: Harrison Ford, Anne Heche,\nDavid Schwimmer\nDirector: Ivan Reitman\nWhen: July 3\nT his year, Harrison Ford - the\nworld's most reliable and\nbank able star - lends his not\ninconsiderable talents to this\nknock about comedy, as a pilot\nmarooned on a desert island with\nhigh-and-mighty magazine editor\nAnne Heche.\nHeche is an ambitious decisive\nNew York girl, taking a week off\nwith her boyfriend in Tahiti. To justify the holiday, she agrees to help\nher magazine out by covering a story on a neighbouring island.\nEnter the Fordster, the only pilot\navailable available, a laid-back\nheavy drinker with whom she\nshares a mutual dislike. But Heche\nhas no choice and he can't refuse\nthe money.\nAnd, of course, this being the\nmovies, the plane then decides to\ncrash land on a remote island,\ndeep in the Pacific. Abandoned and\nwith no hope of rescue, the pair are\nforced to put aside their antagonism in order to survive. As the\ndays go by, they learn to like each\nother, until finally....\nOf course, it all sounds utterly\npredictable (and it probably is), but\nthat's hardly the point. The mix of\nFord, sparky comedy, the regulation action quotient and a bizzar e combination of stars (Anne Heche\nis probably most famous for being\nEllen DeGenres girlfriend) should\nsee Six Days, Seven Nights firmly\nensconced in the box office charts,\nreturning a happy profit. Moreover,\nthe promise of seeing Harrison\nFord try his hand at the style of\nlighthearted comedy preferred by\ndirector Reitman (the man behind\nGhostbusters, Twins, Space Jam\netc.) is surely worth the price of\nadmission alone.\nMoving into the colder\nmonths, the blockbusters\nstill keep on coming, with\ndestruction fest Armageddon pencilled in for release .... Current US\nsensation The Truman Show stars\nJim Carrey in his first \"serious\"\nrole. He is Truman Burbank, star of\nthe world's most popular TV show\n- but he doesn't know he's on TV.\nHis entire life has all been a sham\nand his wife, his friends and his\nparents are all actors .... Toy Story\nstyle effects return in Small\nSoldiers, with Kirsten Dunst\ncaught-up in a war between two\nfactions of toy soldiers .... The\nworrying prospect of a live action\nversion of Cinderella hits the multi-plex es, with the unlikely casting of\nDrew Barrymore as the much put-upon Cinders .... Hitchcock's Dial\nm for Murder is remade as A Perfect Murder, with Andrew\nDavies (The Fugitive, Chain\nReaction) in the director's chair.\nGwyneth Paltrow stars in role\nGrace Kelly made her own .... John\nMcTiernan (Die Hard) steps in to\ndirect The 13th Warrior, the latest\nMichael Chrichton adaptation to\nhit the big screen. Battles featuring\nViking warriors taking on\nNeanderthal cannibals promises a healthy gore quotient. And apparently it's all based on a true story\n.... Disney puts a different spin on\nold folk tales with Mulan, an\nancient Chinese tale given the animation treatment. Advance word\nsuggests that the Mousedom may\nfinally be back on track after their\nrecent shoddy efforts .... Nicholas\nCage is a rogue cop, forced to\nshoot an awful lot of bad guys in\norder to save the day in Snake\nEyes, the latest from Brian de\nPalma .... As Bryan Singer's first\nstint in the director's chair since\nthe brilliant Usual Suspects, Apt\nPupil promises to be a source of\nmuch media attention, particularly\nas it's adapted from a Stephen\nKing novel .... However, it's up\nagainst serious horror opposition,\nin the form The Exorcist, it's still\nbanned on video, so see this\nobject lesson in film-making while\nyou can .... Hugh Grant returns to\nthe comedy fold in Mickey Blue\nEyes. Hilarious consequences\nensue when he discovers that his\ngirlfriend's dad is the Godfather.\n\n"

    "content": "24 June 1998 MUSIC 33\nALBUMS\nETHER\nStrange * * \u2022\nGARBAGE\nVersion 2.0 * * *\nT he Bootfreaks have returned\nrepackaged and with one\nextra, as Ether. Originally\nintended to be a boy band, they\nhave gone indie, with the quirkiest\nlead singers (Rory Meredith winner\nof the John Lennon Song writing\nScholarship) around. To coincide\nwith the launch of their album, they\nhave also released the single Best\nFriend, what the band considered\n1\nto be their crossover hit, to do what\nAlright did for Supergrass. This is a very un typical song from the album\nand promotes a stereotype that\nisn't true in the least.\nShe Could Fly, in contrast, manages to hit the balance of pop and\nnear rock. The band somehow\nmanage to create a completely full\nsound with only a three piece followed by a Ben Folds Five-style\npiano rhythm and an Elvis Costello\nvoice. After such a strong opening\ntrack, the rest of the album is\npushed to deliver but only / Love\nHer Anyway comes close as an\nanti-climaxing love song.\nThe first album may be more of\na lesson to them than a maker or\n\u2022 breaker. A few singles that only\nyour die hard fans can't launch an\nalbum and neither can one song\nthat has been written in an attempt\nto tap into the feel of the charts.\nThey are, however, the fullest\nsounding three piece around and if\nthey can exploit this, there's nothing to stop them.\nDavid\nPOP TARTS\nWoman is the Fuehrer of\nthe World\nT he Germans. They're famous\nfor efficiency. Frankfurters,\npenalty shoot-outs, their\nsense of (ahem) humour and\npoppy little lo-fi punk outfits. OK,\nmaybe not but that's what the Pop\nTarts are. Woman is the Fuehrer of\nW hy fix what ain't broke? That's certainly the\nethic that Garbage have employed with this\nalbum. With their last offering, Garbage\ngave the world an interesting new band format that\nproduced some memorable classics like Milk and\nQueer. Three 'old' producers and one \"young' vocal\ntalent that brought the whole sleazy sound together\nbrilliantly. Samples and loops littered the record and\nthe band lent themselves very well to re-mixes that,\nquite often, surpassed the originals.\nAnd that's the same with Version 2.0. Again, samples and loops cut through the heavy guitars but only\nPush It reclaims the glories of the past. The rest of the\nalbum is good, but tends to merge into one in the\nsearch for something new and different. It's no dirge,\nbut it does get a bit tiring listening to Shirley's voice\nrasping through more effects than you could possibly\nimagine. A couple of simpler tracks that didn't rely so\nmuch on electronics would have provided a great contrast to the rest of the album. More than anything, it\nwould outline more of their talent.\nBut instead of complaining, join me in welcoming\nback the innovators of the goth/dance/indie/rock\nsound. Alok.\nthe World could be described as a sort of mix between our very own\nKenickie and the All-American\nfemale trio, Sleater-Kinney. Not as\nglossy and professionally produced\nas Kenickie but not quite as rough\nand emotionally raw as SleaterKinney. This could probably be put\ndown to the fact that they're not\nsinging in their native tongue for a portion of the time. It's a shame\nreally, as the German language is\nprobably well suited to punk with\nits pronunciation of harsh consonants. Saying this, there are several\ntracks with German titles and a couple sung in the Deutsche lingo.\nThere's OK Vollgas, where the chorus consists of one person just saying 'OK in a quirky German accent\nand another screaming 'Vollgas'.\nApparently, it's the equivalent of\nsaying, 'Hit the gas.' or 'Floor it.'\nAnd they admirably do stick their\nengine into overdrive on this track\nand on Hallo Franzi and So'n Scheiss which roughly translates to\n'So Shit!' Others worthy of mention\nare Buro and Kindheit Jugend Sex,\nOffice and Childhood Youthful Sex\nrespectively. Basically what you've\ngot here is ten short, catchy and\nnoisy songs. It's not really offensive\nand it isn't going to start a series of\nriots in the German capital.\nHowever, it is a nice little snack\nthat you can eat between major\npop punk releases without spoiling\nyour appetite. E3 Dennis.\nTOM WAITS\nBeautiful Maladies\nT his enormous compilation of\ntwenty two tracks has been\nreleased under the subtitle\n\"the Island years\", something of a boast from the record company\nwhich has allowed Waits to produce some of his most strange and\ntwisted material to date. Tom\nWaits is a prolific artist, who has\nexperimented with a wide variety of\nmusical styles from swamp blues to\nRio samba, touching all of them\nwith his unmistakable (and pretty\ndisturbing) presence. It's clear from\nthe subject matter of these songs\nthat Nick Cave owes Waits a huge\ndebt, as they deliver a succession\nof pimps, murderers, messianic\nsaviours and whiskey priests. Most\nstriking, however, is the voice. 80-a day rough with a Southern drawl,\nhe still manages to contort his vocal\nchords in displays of cunning mim-i cry. On The Black Rider, he's the\nspit of Marlene Deitrich groaning\naway in a smoky Berlin nightclub to\na theme lifted directly from The\nFlintstones ('We'll have a gay old\ntime'). Later he's King Louis from\nThe Jungle Book singing about a stop-over in the most dangerous\nport in the world, 'Singapore'. I can\nsmell the salt, the wet ropes and\nrotting meat as he tells us ' The captain is a one-armed dwarf! He's throwing dice along the wharf! In\nthe land of the blind the one-eyed\nman is king\".\nMusically, there's more than a hint of Beefheart experimental is m at work, and Waits is at his best\nwhen perverting blues and jazz,\nsuch as on the strangled Billie\nHolliday moan of Temptation. He is\njust as convincing when he\nacknowledges the roots of his\nmusic in the old blues standard,\nJesus Gonna Be Here, a morbid\nanticipation of the final Judgement\ntrump. Similarly, his love for shit-kicking folk music is clear in / Don't Wanna Crow Old and Cold Cold\nGround, both of which could be\nfrom the Shane MacGowan canon.\nBut I have to give special mention\nto Frank's Wild Years, an old\nfavourite riddled with black\nhumour. Waits plays the lounge bar\nsot, telling how his good friend\nFrank 'Settled down out in the valley I Hung his wild years on the nail\nhe drove through his wife's forehead She was a spent piece of\nused jet-trash, made good Bloody\nMarys, kept her mouth shut most\nof the time, had a little Chihuahua\nnamed Carlos that had some kinda\nskin disease and was totally blind\n.... they were so happy. Frank's story alone is sufficient reason to\nkill yourself getting a copy of this\nalbum, but if you ask real nice, Tom\nmay well do it for you. H Norm\n\n"

    "content": "50\nPLAY REVIEWS\nARTS 24 June 1998\nCOPENHAGEN\nCottesloe Theatre, National Theatre\nYes, that's right fellow IC stu-dents: a play (n. dramatic\npiece or performance) about\nHeisenberg. In a theatre on the\nSouth Bank. At last - an arty far ty event which you can go to without\nthe risk of shedding your \"boring,\napathetic scientist\" label. On the\nevening I went the presence of a large number of physicists in the\naudience was indeed quite appa r ent, but don't let that put you off.\nCopenhagen is the new play by\nMichael Frayn which concerns itself\nwith the meeting between\nHeisenberg and Bohr in\nCopenhagen during the autumn of\n1941. What was actually said during that visit and do we really care?\nin answer to the latter question,\nthe play's suggestion that this\nmeeting affected the course of his-tory, in particular the effect on the\nNazis' atomic programme, should\narouse the curiosity of even that\nmythical character known as the\nTypical IC Student. Another reason\nwhy you should be interested is\nthat the play deals with issues\nwhich are directly concerned with\nthe consequences of what we all\ndo. As well as raising such ethical\nquestions it also confronts the existential issues which concern Man's place on this planet and what drives his pioneering spirit.\nIf it sounds like the play might\nbe quite intense at times then that's because it is. There is no skirting\naround or dumb ing down of the\nscience involved which makes me\nwonder how the non-scientists\nfound it. One's attention is constantly engaged and, by the end, 1\nfelt mentally quite exhausted. This\nis not only due to the dramatic and\nintelligent text but the committed\nand totally absorbing acting (Sara\nKestelman and David Burke as\nMargrethe and Niels Bohr, and\nMatthew Marsh as Werner\nHeisenberg). Director Michael Blakemore keeps it simple and\ndirect - for me, this is what theatre\nis about.\nSo what exactly did happen\nthat evening in 1941? Perhaps we\nshall never know. Michael Frayn\nseems to exhaust all of the conceivable possibilities during the\ncourse of the play. Heisenberg and\nBohr themselves attempted to find\nsome common ground in the matter during a later meeting in 1947\nbut, according to Heisenberg, \" we both came to feel that it would be\nbetter to stop disturbing the spirits\nof the past.\" It is on this point that\nMichael Frayn departs from the historical record and in this meeting\nthey do disturb them further. The\ncontempt with which Heisenberg\nwas treated after the war seems to\nbe a bit harsh since he faced a dilemma in trying to explain his\nactions: had he deliberately lost his\nfellow-Germans the War and been\na traitor to the Nazis, or was he not\nsuch a brilliant scientist after all and\ntruly believed that the building of a nuclear bomb was impractical?\nEither way, he didn't end up with\nthe blood of many tens of thousands on his hands.\nThe other factor raised by the\nplay is the extent to which Heisenberg was aware of his own intentions at the time. When looking into oneself one comes up\nagainst limitations on what one can\nobserve and know; one then\nbecomes restricted in being able to\nmeasure or judge accurately what\nis going on. Rather like the theories\nabout the nature of scientific measurement proposed by certain\nphysicists earlier this century.\nStephen Tarlton\nTHE TAMING OF THE SHREW\nCourtyard Theatre\nAs this is my first review, 1 felt\nlucky that in my debut as a \"critic\" (how grand!) I saw a play that I enjoyed. I found the\ntreatment I received from the people at the CourtYard so polite it\nbordered on embarrassing. 1 was\nspoken to individually, being told\nthat \"the House is now open sir\",\ngiven a free drink and a whole\nbunch of blurb about the cast. The\nreason that this made me feel\noddly awkward was the fact that Iam only a far ty student who has\ndone a Theatre A level and am now\ndamning or praising the extreme\nhard work of twenty people as my\nmood takes me. But, given that 1\nama far ty student, I will tell you why 1 liked this play. (It had nothing\nto do with the free drink.)\nThe Taming Of The Shrew does\nnot hold dear to it's heart the ideas\nof equality or even the slightest\nrespect for women, it was interesting to observe how the production\ncoped with this problem of showing a modem audience ancient,\neven offensive, ideals and ideas.\nTheir method was through a substantially adapted script, the work\nof Phil Willmott. The character of\nPetruchio, played by Dean\nMoynihan, is an example of how\nchanged the play is - Petruchio\nbrags about the fact that he will\nbreak the women whom no other\nman is able to. Yet in this pro duc tion, he seemed to be less bragging\nabout his forthcoming conquest,\nand more attempting to convince\nhimself that he had not bitten off\nmore than he can chew, giving the\nplay a more comic flavour. At the\nfinish, after much sparring with\nfierce Katherina, played by\nMichaele Cussen, he manages to\nobtain her affection. It always,\nhowever, remains clear that he\nrespects her and she respects him.\nIn short this light adaptation was\nfun, pace y and witty.\nThe Courtyard Theatre has a lovely setting. The small theatre\nopens out on to a courtyard (hence\nthe name) and its size and spacing\nmake the action intimate and\nintense rather than in-your-face\nand intimidating. The whole play\nwas set in front of a Cafe in rural\nPadua, very realistically designed\nand built. The costumes and props\nwere suitable and colourful.\nThe production never attempted to be more than it was, always\nsmoothing over what is a nasty\nedge to the play. Some will argue\nthat the adaptations and modifications, which did fundamentally\nalter the very essence of the play,\nare not justified within the text. It\nmay be said that The Taming Of The Shrew is either about the\nbreaking of the strong female or\nnothing. 1 am not approaching this\non literary grounds, whether or not\nthe adaptation was \"artistically jus-tif i ed\"( whatever that means), all 1\nsay is that it held my attention and\nmade me laugh; 1 never felt that it\nwas at all contrived. The company\ngrabbed hold of the play and kicked\nit in to a shape acceptable to a modern audience; a Fringe Theatre\nrecommendation.\nThe production had the kick\nand spark which is only possible\nwhen the cast are bouncing off\neach other, communicating well\nand having a great time. So if, like\nme, you have ever had the yearning\nin your heart to enter the unpredictable, exotic world of drama and\nsod the sensible science degree,\nwell be warned - seeing this will\nmake you wish that you had.\nBen Fisher\n(Pay what you can on Sunday\nnights)\nA CHORUS OF\nDISAPPROVAL\nDramsoc\nWhat I wanted to do, and\nintended to do, was\nwrite a glowing review of\nDramsoc's excellent performance\nof this play, slyly being rude about\nthe almost type-casting, and praising them to the skies in rose-tinted\nprose. A whole page feature on\nthose talented and dedicated\nactors, who also happen to be a bunch of scientists and engineers,\ncomplete with pictures and names\nof the stars. What I end up doing,\nhowever, is sitting at 8 pm on the\nday before the entire paper's due\nto be printed desperately trying to\nfu fill my promise in the two inches\nof column space I have left.\nThere's just enough room to mention my favourite moments: Daffydd and Raymond improvising\nover the lighting, Bridget and Linda\nhalf-killing each other over Crispin,\nEnid's singing, the costumes, the\nmusic, the set and the intentional-ly(?) amateurish choreography.\nCongratulations Dramsoc, it\nwas very good, good luck for next\ntime, and stop complaining, I wrote you an embarrassingly gushing preview.\nJulia\n\n"

Dr. Dolittle,\nstarring Eddie Murphy as the\neponymous animal talking scientist. Think Babe meets Nutty pro-fess or, and you're probably heading in the right direction. Its a remake of the 1968 Rex Harrison\nmusical in the loosest sense of the\nword.... On the subject of musical\nadaptations, Les Miserables finally\ngets a proper big screen outing.\nIt's a direct adaptation of the\nVictor Hugo novel though, so don't respect stars Liam Neeson, Uma Thurman and Geoffrey Rush to\nbreak into song every five minutes\n.... The regulation Low Budget\nBritish Entry\u2122 comes in the form\nof Metroland, an adaptation of the\nJulian Barnes novel. Christian Bale\nstars as the 60's twenty something escaping his married life by fleeing\nto France .... Looking to relieve\nthose halcyon teenage days? Then\ncatch Love and Death on Long\nIsland, and remember just how\nmuch you hated that smug g it Jason Priestly .... For the horror\nfans out there, this years major\nHollywood offering comes in the\nform of Mimic. Mira Sorvino is the\nyoung scientist who creates a cure\nfor a killer disease, but in the\nprocess creates giant killer bugs,\nlurking in the New York sewers.\nThe twist is that the bugs can alter\ntheir form to become that of their\npray. Invasion of the\nBociysnatchers style events ensue\n.... Chubby Goes Down Under is\nanother outing for Roy Chubby\nBrown. Watch it and we kill you... A Thousand Acres is billed as\n\"King Lear in the Praries\". Bizzare\nas that may sound, it's attracted a top notch cast, including Jessica\nLange, Michelle Pfieffer and Jennifer Jason Leigh .... Re-release\ngems this month include Hitchock\nclassic Psycho, giving you the\nchance to watch a lovely new print\nof the adventures of Norman Bates\nand his mum.... Grease also gets\nthe re-release treatment. A prime\nopportunity to terminally embarrass yourself by strutting your\nfunky stuff. Just watch Travolta go!\nGODZILLA Stars: Matthew Broderick, jean\nReno, Hank Azaria\nDirector: Roland Emmerich\nWhen: July 17\nRoland Emmerich and Dean\nDevlin, the producer-dire c tor combination responsible\nfor Independence Day, return with\nanother sure-fire box-office smash,\nalmost sinking under the weight of\nits own effects. However, this time\nthey have chosen to go without any\nof the usual A list actors, opting for\na combination of eighties hero\nBroderick( Wargames, Ferris\nBueller's Day Off) and Gallic hard-man Jean Reno (Leon, Mission\nImpossible).\nThere will also be disappointment for fans of the original\nJapanese man-in-a rubber-suit\nspectacular, as Emmerich readily\nadmits to ditching the entire feel\nand plot of the original, in favour of\na more nineties friendly storyline.\nHe describes the movie as \"The\nfight between nature and techno lo gy....it's much more about people\nthan the original movies\". So, nothing like Jurassic park then. Oh no.\nin essence, the storyline is\nhideously simple. Large monster\nappears and starts to trample its\nway through New York, destroying\neverything in its path. Only a combination of gritty US Military types\nand brilliant young scientists can\nsave the day....Basically, Emmerich\nand Devlin re-tread ID4, only with\none big monster replacing lots of\naliens.\nWithout doubt, this will be the\nbiggest film of the summer, setting\numpteen new box office records in\nthe process. But be warned - in the\nstates it has (un surprisingly) taken\na critical drubbing, and after just\ntwo weeks has started to slip down the top ten, overtaken by popular\nfavourites City of Angels and 77ie Truman Show.\nCITY OF ANGELS Stars: Meg Ryan, Nicolas Cage,\nDennis Franz\nDirector: Brad Silberling\nWhen: July 10\nT his summer's Meg Ryan film\npromises all the usual ingredients - sweet, soppy romance,\ncharacters forced to put love\nbefore life (or, in this case, immortality), and a heavy kleene x quo-tien t. Nicholas Cage is one of the\nheavenly host that occupies Los\nAngeles, unseen by the millions of\nnon-believers who live and work in\nthe city. They congregate on Malibu beach or perch atop\nchurches and skyscrapers, watching over and protecting the citi-zen s. And all the time, the pop u lace remain unaware of their presence, unable to see Cage and his\nfellow spirits unless they \"will you\" to see them.\nOne day Cage encounters\nunhappy heart surgeon Meg Ryan,\nand, instantly smitten, wills her to\nsee him. She realises that he is\nsomehow different, but (quite sen-si bly) can't accept his claims to be\na disciple of God. Yet how can she\nexplain her inability to feel his\ntouch....\nUnremarkable schmaltz this\nmay sound, but with wee pie queen\nRyan and the always likeable Cage\n(trying to escape his action-junkie\npersona) in the starring roles, City\nof Angels should have those of a more romantic disposition bawling\ntheir eyes out - particularly when\nCage is forced to choose between\nimmortality and the woman he\nloves\nFor those who prefer a little\nmore substance to their movies, a minimal level of effects, amusing\ncameos from NYPD Blue's Dennis\nFranz and Homicide's Andre Braugher and a script adapted from\nWim Wenders Wings of Desire,\nshould combine to produce the hot\nfavourite for chick-flick of the year.\n\n"

    "content": "24 June 1998 MUSIC 41\nCLUBSCENE - CLUB REVIEW\nAWOL @ The Camden Palace\nAfter hearing so much about\nthose now legendary AWOL\nnights down the Paradise\nClub of a few years back, hearing\nthe tapes but never actually going\nto one, when I saw they were doing\na one off night down the Camden\nPalace I just had to go. I knew it\nwould be nothing like the original\nnights, but it was as close as I was\ngoing to get without the aid of time\ntravel. For those of you who don't know, AWOL made their name during the early '90's, putting on regular all-night ers playing a unique\nblend of ground-breaking with\ntrend setting drum and bass.\nThis one-off night was also\nbeing held in conjunction with\nPublic Demand records, a fast\nemerging Garage label who took\nover the second arena to celebrate\nthe launch of their new album,\nBacked By Public Demand. I attended a night down here a few\nmonths back but never made it to\nthe second arena: no wonder, it's hidden away at the very top of this\nmassive venue, up five or six dod gy back stairwells. To be honest, in\ncomparison to the vastness of the\nPalace, this second arena is pis-st a kingly small. Fifty people nearly\nfilled it, but that said it was still\nrocking in there and the DJ, who\never it was, was rolling.\nFor those of you who have\nnever been to the Camden Palace,\nit was a theatre before being converted into one of London leading\nvenues with a capacity of at least\n1,500. The set up is a stage/DJ box\nwith a large dancefloor splayed out\nin front of it, then about six rows of\nbalconies of varying width going up\nto the ceiling.\nWe took up position on the\nsecond from top balcony, where\nwe could see the breathtaking view\nof thousands of people having it,\nthe DJ mixing and the stunning light\ndisplay - most impressive. Last\ntime I was here, I was knocked out\nby the light display, and they have\ndone it up again since then - with\nthe centre piece being the most\npowerful laser I 've seen, and I 've\nseen plenty. Everyone I spoke to\nmentioned how shit-hot it was - it\nreally needs to be seen to be\nbelieved.\nDJs on the night were JJ Frost,\nRap, Zinc, Grooverider, Andy C, Kenny Ken, who played a wicked\nset that just rolled along, and the\nscratch master Hype, who got\nstraight down to business and\ntotally blew up the place - the ultimate entertainer. It was a little\nharsh putting the up and coming\nnewcomer DJ Scope on right after\nHype, and making such a big thing\nabout him being a new DJ, which\ncould have only made the geezer\nmore nervous than ever, and how\ndo you follow Hype? Well, not\nbadly really from what 1 heard and\nconsidering records were jumping\nall over the place after Hype had\nfucked the needles after going\ncrazy on the decks, he sounded as\ngood as anyone to me.\nOverall a excellent night with a great atmosphere not always associated with Drum and Bass nights -especially when they stopped serving alcohol before we even got\nthere (Sunday license). Shock hor-r or, even a fair number of ladies in\nthe place. Be sure to look out for\nsome more dates in the not too\ndistant future.\nJo Public\nCLUBSCENE - FEATURED ALBUM & CLUB REVIEW\nEmotif presents - THE METHOD HELTA SKELTA @ The Sanctuary\nB bill lI \u00ab mmm mam Blim\nT Power\nBefore starting a review of an\nalbum, I generally listen to it\njotting down the tracks that\nstand out for some reason, good or\nbad. With this one, I found myself\nputting down one track after a no th er. If it wasn't for the slightly more\nexperimental numbers toward the\nend, they would have all been put\ndown as outstanding tracks. It's OK, I'm not going to try and explain\neach one in detail, instead I 'll tell\nyou about a couple of my\nfavourites and some that are so\nnearly great tracks out of the\ntwelve, but just miss.\nClick and Cycle - Trippin' (Tonic\nremix) starts things off in fine f ash ion: dark, hard and definitely tripping on those haunting key tones,\nkiller beats, breaks and effects.\nNext, L Double and Acetate bring in\nthe jazz lick with Style Wars: droning bassline runs alongside jazz\ntrumpet or something similar then\nafter the first breakdown this is dispensed with and a drum pattern\nnot all that dissimilar to Warhead\ntakes over: wicked track. Dylan of\nDroppin' Science Duo has produced another tearing track, hard,\neven fierce and dark: loads going\non: awesome. T Power brings in a more experimental style of track as\ndoes Basic Unit, music for the mind\nnot just the body.\nNext up Elements Of Noise .\nThis starts off with a similar experimental feel, then halfway through it\ndrops big time, transforming into a more dance floor number: clever\nstuff.\nAlthough I haven't got any of\nthese on vinyl, they all sound familiar due to them being played in the\nclubs. Most of the tracks here have\na dark edge, yet all are interpreted\nin different ways, in general, it's amazing how these people manage\nto get such feeling and emotion out\nof a bunch of transistors and\nprocessors.\nSo, an upfront account of\nwhere Drum and Bass is today, if\nslightly distorted towards the dark\nside. Oh, did I mention that this\ncomes on either an un-mixed or\nmixed CD: nice for us to be given\nthe choice for a change. The mix is\ntaken care of by Ray Keith, bringing\nthe sound of Movement\n(Thursday's at Bar Rumba) to your\nliving room.\nJo Public\nTo the person I sent down to\nreview Helta Skelta, got in for\nnothing (saving you \u00a325),\njumping the extensive queues,\nthanks for not even bothering to\nwrite down a few words about it.\nYou know who you are - I 'll break\nyour legs later.\nNevermind, I 've\nbeen to plenty of Helta\nSkelta events before\nnow at the Sanctuary,\nMilton Keynes and I can\ntell you what to expect:\ntwo massive arenas\nwith a capacity for\n5,000 party people,\nfriendly and helpful\nsecurity, fuck-off sound\nand lighting rigs and the\nbest hardcore and drum\nand bass DJs. Well, the It's how Big?\npictures pretty much tell their own\nstory.\nIf you're around the Stoke-OnTrent area on the 17th July, look\nout for their first ever club night at\nthe Void Club.\nMost promoters start off by\ndoing club nights then\ngo on to do huge warehouse style parties.\nNot Helta Skelta. They\nprefer to do it the other\nway - do you think\nthey're Irish or something ?\nPhotos courtesy of\nGary Clarke.\n\n"

    "content": "34 MUSIC 24 June 1998\nALBUMS\nIMOGEN\nHEAP\nBRAN VAN 3000\nMegaphone\nS he sings like Tori Amos on a bad day. She writes her own songs, and she's younger\nthan me. If she was a bit better,\nshe'd be fantastic. As it is, her\nangst ridden songs are just i rr it at ing. Some of the lyrics are great (/\nam your whore/without a name/you took me in again), but\nmost of the songs on this album\nare fairly poor. Don't waste your\ncash on it, buy the new Tori Amos album instead if you really need an\ninjection of angst ridden female\nvocals. Alternatively, you could come and listen to mew hinging about my problems. It'll only cost\nyou a fiver. EI\nJulia\nGlee\nT his Canadian born gathering\nis State Side in every way. They have the narration's and\nmixing of the Beastie Boys, combined with the sampling and many\nshort tracks style of Beck.\nBran Van 3 0 0 0 is the brainchild\nof Jamie Di Salvio, a DJ, re-mixer\nand video director. He gathered\n20 Montreal musicians, producers,\nsingers and rappers together and just started recording. Since then\nthe 'band' has gone on tour with six\nsingers and as you've probably\nguessed the result is an album full\nof many flavours.\nIt isn't until the third song, their\nsingle Drinking In LA that the tracks\nhave any individuality. The first two\njust jump from sample to sample,\nand if the Drinking In LA didn't come along most listeners would\njust give up. Drinking in LA pulls\nthe listener back in, with its easy\nlistening rap and strong chorus line.\nIt clearly stands out on the albums\nbeing one of the only radio-friendly\nsongs.\nThe rest of the album lurches\nbetween rap, reggae, rock, pop, dance and indie and is difficult to\nget into. Bran Van 3 0 0 0 obviously\nhave the talent to be a good band,\nbut in an attempt to combine contrasting sounds, they have cut up and over-produced their songs to\nmuch. You get the feeling that they\nhaven't fully thought out what fits\nwith what else . If you are interested in sampling or just experimenting with music, however, then C/ ee\nwill give you plenty ideas to play\nwith. David\nDEEP PURPLE\nAbandon No Stars\nCool, the rock gods are back'\nI thought when I was handed this CD. Having misspent\nmany hours of my youth moshi ng away to such gems as My Woman\nfrom Tokyo I was really curious\nabout this new album. Three tracks\nand quarter of an hour later, I had\nto switch off. This album is arse. Ifs\nglam rock at its most pathetic, the\nvocals sad/comic, the riffs seemingly random. Richie Blackmore's replacement Steve Morse who has,\notherwise, done some decent stuff\nis insufferably dull and Jon Lord's new Hammond needs many more\nmiles of touring before it regains its\nformer glories. Unfortunately this\nwould also do him in. There's nothing new or interesting here even for\na die-hard soft rocker caught in a1985 time warp. El Antoine\nSINGLES\nBlack Box Recorder -England Made Me\nDark lyrics of the Beth Gibbons variety in an altogether Portishead sort of song. Possibly jumping\non the World Cup/Cool Britannia bandwagon.\nWamdue Project - King Of My Castle\nEasy trance beats behind the watery vocal \"Must\nbe a reason why I'm king of my castle\" makes\nthis a pleasing, if slightly bland, single.\nBernard Butler - A Change of Heart\nBernie's new song is exactly halfway between\nhis previous singles Stay and Not Alone. Prone\nto adding those cheesy air-guitar bits from Bill &\nTed, I doubt this will add to the sizeable credit\nhe's been building up this year.\nSpace - Begin Again\nWhile Space's previous songs have all had a certain charm lying behind their quirky exterior, this\n\"Phoney Valentino\" attempt is just plain annoy-ing.\nLodger - Always Round Here\nThe follow-up to their tremendous debut I'm Leaving shows co-singer Pearl Lowe being a bit\ntoo Bjork-ish. The song's still great though,\nshowing signs of a certain band's influence:\nDanny Supergrass is Pearl's husband and co songwriter.\nVelocette - Spoiled Children\nVery similar to early St. Etienne but with a harder edge, this lush ly harmon is ed song is quite\nendearing. A lay back and chill in the sun song.\nEd\nChumbawamba - Top of the World\nOh my God I hate Chum b awam ba and this is as\nbad as it gets, a world cup song that has been\nlinked to the Spanish team due to the OLE' s in\nit! So this is one you should go no where near.\nI wish Chumbawamba were on top of the world,\nliterally.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON based dance. GAB are crazy live, produce scary\nmusic that sounds a little like Rage Against the\nMachine, and are certainly not mainstream. But\nthat's not necessarily a bad thing at all.\nPropellerheads - Bang Onl\nA manic electro-laced race through a computer\ngenerated landscape on coke and speed, with\nthe occasional guitar solo breather. Mad completely mad. The excellent B side, Velvet Pants\n(Spare Pair Mix) is far more groovy I guess, a tune that's definitely of the jazzy cigarette variety! v. Beastie Boys - Intergalactic\nAfter four years away the Beasties are finally\nback with their amazing new space aged single.\nIt's typical Beastie's rapping with the much\nen vogue electro speech being used for the chorus as well as an addictive Rachmaninoff loop in\nthe background. Simply brilliant!!\nDel Amitri - Don't Come Home Too Soon\nAnother World Cup song but at least this one is\nfor Scotland. Del Amitri sing a moving ode to\nScottish football misfortune that isn't too bad at\nall. Certainly not rousing, one for the boys to cry\nalong to when Scotland come back home in a few weeks.\nElectrasy - Lost in Space\nElectrasy are going to be big allegedly. They\nappeared on TFI Friday a weeks ago and didn't particularly impress and neither does this single.\nA bog standard indie/pop song with no real\nimagination or particular style.\nGirls Against Boys - Park Avenue\nA single that certainly is heavy American guitar\nSuperior - Being You\nA well produced, carefully thought out tune that\nis well sung by the female vocalist. Kind of an\nintelligent, melancholic indie track that is reminiscent of the Levellers but definitely not as\ncheesy. The B sides are good too with a mini-malis tic80's feel to them. May be a band to watch out for.\nRamzi.\n\n"

This is,\nwithout a shadow of a doubt, one\nof the most innovative Dn'B projects of recent time. From the off,\nSignals provides an awesome\nfusion of techno-style melodies\nwith rough bass-lines.\nStraying from the D'n'B norm,\nSonartribe are Fulham based Mike\nMarsh and Lorna Lewis. When they\nare not programming for the BBC or\nteaching Aerobics, their shared love\nof the weird and wonderful leads\nthem to produce some of the darkest Drum and Bass around.\nMike and Lorna's ability to wander through a journey comprising of\nhard step pin' breaks and beats,\nslam min' sub-hooks, Balearic guitar\nriffs and techno-edged electro\nbeats leaves you wondering what\nelse they are going to unleash.\nAll ten tunes are top notch, and\nthose such as Night Acoustic,\nEveryone else and Rays ate an\nessential for any DJ box, although\nthe only slight criticism is the lack\nof variety from tune to tune.\nDEEP DISH JUNK SCIENCE\nOut Now it-kit\nDeep Dish, contrary to popular\nbelief, is not a cooking utensil\nneeded to follow along with Ready\nSteady Cook but the hottest thing\never to come out of Washington.\nAli and Sharam have rocked the\nhouse scene since collaborating in\n1992. Their first major work was a lead remix of Hideaway by De'Lacy.\nSince then, they have been asked\nto spin their magic in re-working\ntracks by artists such as Janet\nJackson, Tina Turner, Paula Abdul\nand Everything but the Girl (EBTG).\nDeep Dish are musicians. This\ndebut album features live guitars,\nsax and keyboards. Track 2, Future\nOf The Future, with vocals by\nEBTG's Tracey Thorn, is a reworking\nof their first track with the\nDeconstruction label, Stay Gold.\nAli and Sharam's diverse music\ntaste is no better illustrated than\nbetween Summer's Over, which\nhas a laid back, trance y feel to it,\nand Mohammed is Jesus, which is\narguably what house used to be in\nthe good old days.\nThis album is a masterpiece. All\ntunes live up to the duo's high stan-dards, and eventually it is said that\nthis album will be taken fully live.\nUntil then, roll a reefer, turn up your\nsystem and chill out.\nP.S. To D Clarke (Physics 1)\nwho in Issue 1115 voiced his disgust at the lack of grammar in these\nreviews. If you feel as though you\nhave something to offer, then\nplease come and show us your\nstuff - but in the meantime, is my\ncolon in the right place ?- you seem\nlike the sort of person who would\nknow....\nChris\nDope Dragon. Wayz Of The Dragon\n22 June \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDope Dragon, coming out of\nthe Full Cycle camp (you should\nknow their names by now!) bring\nus a collection of out and out Drum\nand Bass tracks with enthuses on\nthe dance floor. The first couple of\ntracks Came and Conjured and\nWho Are You set the stall out for\nhow the rest of the album is to fol-low. It's a bit hard to judge just how\ngood these tracks are as I 've only\nheard it on tape, but what I could\ntell is that it is packed full of quality\nand originality from the Bristol\ncrew. Plenty of rolling and hard-stepping business going on here\nand, if you've been out recently,\nyou're bound to have heard at least\none of these tracks. As with all the\nrecent Drum and Bass albums, it\nhas the standard Warhead sounding track. Overall very impressive,\nso much so that I'm going to have\nto track down the vinyl before it's too late.\nMade Great In Britain Mixed by the\nDreemTeem (4 Liberty)\nOut Now \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nA much-hyped album from\nthose leaders of garage music, the\nDreem Teem, show-casing the\ncream of the UK garage scene\nthat's blown up over the past year.\nSo, what's this latest mixed compilation like? Well at first I was a little\ndisappointed as I know what good\nDJs these boys are and I understand that the enthusiasm is on the\ntunes with the mixing taking second\nplace. The album rolls along seam-less ly with great tune selection and\nimpressive mixing skills still on\nshow, if kept to a minimum. Not\nquite as hard as their club sets but\ninstead focusing on the more vocal\nside of underground garage. That\nsaid, however, there are plenty of\ntrue underground anthems on here\nlike : Dubz 4 Kubz - / Neeed Your\nLove, Dreem Teem's superb mix of\nShola Ama's Much Love, Ramsey\nand Fenns - Style, TJ Cases - My\nInspiration, I could go on but I won't. Plenty of underground\naction with a nice mix of more\nvocal numbers, it should go down\nwith train-spotters' and the occasional club ber equally well.\nBlack Whole Styles. Big Dadda\nCompilations 8th June it it it it\nThis is a compilation of previously released, exclusive and\nremixed tracks from the Big Dadda\nlabel. Drawing on MCs and producers ranging from New York too\nYork. Black Whole Styles features\nsome of the realist hip-hop I 've\nheard in some time. If you've\ngrown disillusioned by the mass of\nmore commercial hip-hop flooding\nthe scene at the moment, this\ncould be just the answer, taking you\nback to the roots when hip-hop\nwas original, upfront and ex peri mental: this captures all that and\nmore. Phat beats, dark atmospheric als, dope lyrics and plenty of\nscratch action keeps it lively but\nthen again, there are so many different styles here (nearly every\ntrack is different) I couldn't possibly\nsum them up in so little space. Take\na chance on this relatively unknown\nlabel as I'm sure it will surprise you.\nFreestyle Files 4. Crackers Delight\n(K7) 6 Jury \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThis starts off with a distinctive\nsummer feel to it, in a down beat\nstyle you could call it happy hip-hop. Laid back grooves over easy\ngoing beats, and a summery feel. I found a few of the tracks a little to\nlight and fluffy, for v/ ant of a better\nexpression, for my taste. But with\ntracks from such labels as R&S, Ninja Tunes and Nuphonic and\neven a Drum and Bass track from\nthe Dub Club again with a summer\nvibe, you don't know what to\nexpect next. Then you get to the\nsecond CD which 1 expected to\ncontinue in the same up lifting sort\nof styles, but instead you get a dark\nminimal down beat number to get\nthe CD started - in total contrast to\nthe first. You have to be very open\nminded to appreciate this assorted\ncollection of beats.\nRough Technique Mixed by the\nFreestylers (Freskanova)\n29 June \u2022\u2022\u2022\u20221/2\nYou should know what to\nexpect from the Freestylers by now,\nblock rocking break beat/nu skool\naction, showing us that they don't just make shit-hot tunes but also\ncan more than hold their own\nbehind the turntables. If you've\nbeen lucky enough to catch their DJ\noutings all over London and\nbeyond, then this CD will not di sap point. Made up entirely from the\nFreskanova back catalogue, unbelievable how many rough tunes\nthey've put out, featuring many\nfirm party favourites and new unreleased material. With the undisputed scratch DJ talents of J Rock\nputting the finishing touches to a faultless 70 odd minutes of nu-skool mayhem.\nMuki. Cabin Fever (Mantra)\n6 Jury \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAs with most albums these\ndays, this one defies any distinct\nstyle of music other than electron-ic. Based mainly in the area of trip-hop but often spilling over into\nDrum and Bass, Techno and even\nDeep House.\nTrack two - Jahbar, starts out in\na style reminiscent of Orbital's sort\nof sound and gradually builds (over\nnine and a half minutes) to a trance y deep house sort of thing.\nPlenty of live instruments are also\nincorporated to create this unique\nsound that is Muki: flutes, sax, keys\nand in track three what sounds like\na kazoo! But it is all done so well,\nthey seem to get it just right every\ntime, getting quite musical in\nplaces. Which helps create the\nbliss ed out atmospheric grooves\nthat fill this album - described in the\npress release as lush laid back electronica and I can't think of a better\nway of putting it so I won't. So Luke Mullen and Jules Evans\nwho make up Muki have made an\ninteresting and entertaining album\nand, as they have only been making\nmusic for just over a year, it just\nshows either how talented they are\nor how easy it is to make electronic music! jo Public\n\n"

How hard can it be to\ncreate a pipe that will not burst?\nQuite tricky for Southside Hall,\napparently, who experienced\nsomething of a rupture in their\nplumbing on the 7 September. The\nresultant cascade of this Water of\nLife affected most of the hall's staircases and forced the Linstead\nhousekeeper, Sheena McD on a gh, to spend her evening in a less interesting way than she had planned.\nAlready slightly anxious fresher s may have become even more concerned upon seeing Felix's front\npage depicting the introduction of\nsecurity dogs on the South\nKensington campus, presumably to\nfight off the crack, organised, criminal squad of muggers, drug dealers\nand con-artists that patrol Imperial\nCollege both night and day. One problem with which these canine\npolicemen seemed unable to deal\nwas the spontaneous combustion\nof the Sherfield cash machine, supposedly caused by a malfunctioning\nreceipt printer. Mulder and Scully\nwere subsequently called in; Beavis\nand Butt-head were held for ques-tion ing, after witnesses spotted\nthem trashing the Sherfield coffee\nstall.\n1093: 10 October 97\nHomeless\nMore concern for newly-arrived IC\nstudents, upon noticing that one of\nthe Halls of Residence was falling\nto pieces. Luckily it transpired that\nonly an ornamental section of\nGarden Hall's \"dental course\" had\ncollapsed, and the rest of the block\nwas described as \"[being] in an\nacceptably safe condition\". This did\nnot help ICU President Eric Allsop,\nwho failed to be anywhere near the\nmasonry when it fell, and hence\nwas not put out of his fifteen-month Presidential misery.\nIt was just as well that our existing Halls were managing to stand\nthe test of time, though, given the\nother front-page article this week,\n\"IC Accommodation at Crisis\nPoint\", describing the heart-wrenching story of students having\nto live in Clayponds rather than in\nnice local halls. Spare a thought for\nthe people sleeping on the\nEmbankment: I read a story once\nabout a student who spent two\nyears in a tent. Iam also rather surprised that we did not end up running a story: \"Three hundred IC\nfresher s have resigned from their\ncourses after worries about crime\non-campus\" alongside the pieces\nentitled \"Clayponds Thefts Restart\"\nand \"Equipment Nicked\", and a potential alcoholic catastrophe: the\nUnion's trouble in obtaining a Public Entertainment Licence.\n1095: 24 October 97\nPoison Gas\nSkipping high over Issue 1094,\nwhich seems to have been erased\nfrom history, we discover that\n\"Physics Leaks Deadly Fluorine\":\nalthough not very often, thankfully -this was caused by three disused\ncylinders of the gas waiting to be\nchucked out. There were also com plaints by IC's Safety Officer that\nmembers of staff had been seen\ngazing out of windows while the\nalarm was raised all around them.\nPerhaps they were attempting to\n\u2022 .\u2022 . . .:\n\u2022 -1\nstay as far as possible away from\nSouthside Bar, which saw the first\nof its many brawls this week.\n1096: 31 October 97\nLet's Get Sued\nThe front page story outlined IC's plans to build its own power sta-tion, apparently churning out\n3 . 8 7 5 MW note that this is still\nonly 0.32% of the 1.21 GigaWatts\nrequired to help out a trapped\nMarty McFly. Cases of meningitis\nwas once more reported at a harassed Cardiff University, and\nthere was seemingly some affliction at the Felix office as well - published in this issue was the infamous story about the Conference\nCentre which cost the editor valuable apology space for the next two\nissues. It was either that, or get\nsued. Other bad news: Blunkett's tuition fee suggestion raised its\nugly head for the first of many\noccasions here, with the news that\nthousands of prospective students\nwere being discouraged from\nattending University by the financial\npressure involved. It was probably\nalso about this time that Andrew Heeps (not President yet, re mem ber) formulated his cheesy \"ability\nto learn rather than ability to earn\"\nquip. A future in the House of\nLords beckons, surely.\n1097: 7 November 97\nBones\nOne of two news stories written by\nyours truly this year was emblazoned in glorious tech nicol our( well, orange and black) across the\nfront page of an issue whose design was described as both \"vile\"\nand \"great\" in subsequent letters\npages. This superbly written slice of\npoly chromatic drivel detailed a march in protest against the introduction of tuition fees. A photograph taken at the march depicted\nthe two new ICU Presidential candidates being overshadowed by a skeleton - could it have been the\nghost of New Election? Another\npipe burst this week, much to the\namusement of anyone not doing\nMechanical Engineering: a steam\npipe on the fifth floor of the building took it upon itself to cancel a few lectures, and create an\nimpromptu sauna.\nThere were also the hustings for\nthe jobs of DP(C&S) and ICU\nPresident, although many would\nrather have seen it as a vote de cid \u2022 i::::'::':i;::'|:'i\":': HMH\nB\\ \u2014\ning whether Eric Allsop should be\nlet out of his cell after fifteen\nmonths.\n1098: 14 November 97\nRag Mag Slagged\nDemocracy decided that Allsop\nshould indeed be returned to the\nwild, as Charlie Joynt and Andrew\nHeeps were selected to climb up\nthe ziggurat of command by those\nvoters that did leave their beds.\nThe defeated Presidential candidate was Mark Baker, and may I say that he has not stopped whining about the kitchen sink since.\nThere were chuckles all round at\n\n"

Apparently\nI he owed some guy money and they got into a I fight and guns were pulled. Tupac's mother,\n\u2022 Afeni, plans to release an album of tribute songs\non Amaru Records. It is rumoured to be remakes\nof Tupac songs by many different artists, and\nMadonna may even be involved! 1 get around,\nindeed. The album should be released on the\nsecond anniversary of Tupac's death,\nSeptember 13th1998. There will probably be a Biggie tribute album\nfrom the Bad Boy camp as well, although I have\nI been hearing that Puffy is planning to record a1 gospel album! You have been warned.\n| Lauryn Hill and Wyclef do not seem to be on\n| the best of terms. Lauryn's new album appa rIen t ly doesn't have any Wyclef production, and\n1 her first few lines on her new single, Lost Ones,\nI seem to be aimed at him.\nI Nate Dogg's album should be out some-1 where but it will be officially released in the\n| States at the end of the month, so expect HMV\nVirgin etc to flood us with overpriced imports.\nThe album is entitled G Funk Classics and contains 2 great songs with Snoop and Tupac, it's Gj Funk like it is supposed to be. Also, Nate has a I track out with Warren G( don't know if this is on\n1 his album, but it is on the Woo soundtrack) and\nI it's what you expect: laid-back funk.\n1 Master P should release a clutch of albums\nI on his No Limit Records.

The only bad thing I find is that it is too short!

It\nreached number two in the charts over here and\nis number one in the US. The album is supposed\nto be pretty good and has a few guest rappers\non it like Mase.

    "content": "NEWS 24 June 1998\nSummer Ball Success\nALAN CEER AND JULIA HARRIES\nThe first ever Imperial College\nSummer Ball was held on Friday 19\nof June at Alexandra Palace, and\nproved to be an unprecedented\nsuccess. The event, which sold out\nseveral weeks ago, was attended\nby over a thousand people. Apart\nfrom only seven coaches turning up\nto take people to the Ball and the\nridiculously small numbers of bar\nstaff, the Ball was enjoyed by all.\nOrganisers had not planned on\napathetic IC students wanting to\ndance, or even wanting to come,\nbut in the event the dance floor\nbecame too crowded. Johnny Ball,\nafter consuming several bottles of\nwine, gave an im men sly popular\nspeech, and although only some\nrevellers could hear him, he\nreceived a standing ovation.\nExuberant and very drunk students including Andy Heeps, 32,\nwere forced to find other avenues\nof amusement. Luckily with\ndodge ms,a casino and the karaoke\nmachine, no one would have\nnoticed Mr. Heeps' hairy buttocks.\nAmazing lighting effects and the\nuncharacteristically friendly atmosphere made a complete change\nfrom Union carnivals. The groovy\ncrowds partied until they were\nfinally forced out in the early hours\nby weary Ally Pally staff. It looks like\nthe Imperial Ball is here to stay,\nmake sure you get your tickets\nearly next year.\nLeft: Ling Lee, one of the students\nwho organised the ball;. Below:\nThe dodge ms were a big at tra c tion. Right Johnny Ball in the middle of his popular after-dinner\nspeech. Above: The small dance\nfloor was crammed to capacity.\nPhotos: Mark Baker.\nPrint Unit's Last Impression\nJEREMY THOMSON\nAfter nearly twenty years, 1CU Print\nUnit is set to close. The print shop, which is thought to be the only in-house union printing facility in the\ncountry received its death-knell\nfrom a unanimous vote from an\nemergency ICU council last Friday.\nThe print unit was founded by\nFelix in order to provide cheap, fast\nnewspaper printing. It continued\nfor many years, growing larger and\nundertaking jobs for clubs and\nother organisations. It was run\nunder the management of subsequent Felix editors, until a decision\nwas made in 1995 to expand it into\na full trading outlet.\nOver the last two years, how ev er, the unit has run into problems.\nFirstly, the space occupied by the\nprint unit is required for the extension of dBs taking place this sum-mer, and no provision for new\nspace has been confirmed by col-leg e. Problems have also been\nencountered in training students to\nprint, and lack of profits have ruled\nout a full-time professional printer.\nConcern about the newly revealed\nfinancial performance of the print\nunit and the need for major investment brought matters to a head.\nFurther bad news came from the\nprint unit manager, who revealed\nthat he was considering retirement\nat the end of this year.\nSeveral options were considered by council, including expanding the unit, switching to new printing technology or handing control\nof the print shop back to Felix, the\noption favoured by the current Felix\neditor. In the end, however, it was\ndecided to give all jobs to external\nprinting companies and pull the\nplug.\nThe equipment owned by the\nprint unit is being sold, and the proceeds are currently set to fund the\n'Animal House' - the new ICU\nmedia centre to be built in the west\nwing basement of Beit Quad next\nyear. Felix itself looks likely to be\nproduced by East End Offset in\nBow, who have also printed this\nissue.\nConcern was raised by both the\nFelix Editor and the editor elect, Ed\nSexton, over the timing of Felix pro-duct ion. The current tradition of a Friday release would prevent up-to\ndate news coverage, and would\ndelay sports reporting by at least a week. \"We will have to seriously\nconsider whether it is worth continuing as a weekly publication\", said\nEd Sexton. \"The Print Unit was created by Felix, for Felix\", explained\ncurrent editor Jeremy Thomson,\n\"We are facing problems, but not\ninsurmountable ones. I think it is a great shame that, because the\nunion has been able to develop the\nPrint Shop into a trading outlet,\nthey have simply closed it.\"\nHowever, the discussions\nremained diplomatic, with Andy\nHeeps recognising the origin of the\nprint shop; \"I think that there is a strong argument that Felix should\nreceive the majority of the proceeds from the closure - though\nit's all union money in the end\", he\nsaid. The Print Unit Manager, Andy\nThompson, also seemed resigned\nto the fate of the print shop; \"Obviously, my initial reaction was\none of disappointment, that the\nunion's development of dBs failed\nto take into account the requirements of its Print Unit. However,\nthe print industry is fast-changing\nand without major investment in\nnot only equipment, but also staff,\nwe could never hope to compete.\nFuthermore, if the Print Unit were\nto succeed as a trading outlet by\ntaking on major accounts, this\nwould be to the detriment of the\nunion's clubs and societies, which\nto my mind would be a conf ict of\ninterest.\"\n\n"

    "content": "36\nINTERVIEW\nMUSIC 24 June 1998\n\u2022\nWho are you? What do you do with music?\n1 try to make electronic music; psychedelic\nstuff. The most important thing about me is that\nI'm from Cologne.\nYou're in a group called Air Liquide. Can you tell\nus about that project?\nJammin' Unit and myself founded Air Liquide\nin 1991. Jammin' Unit used to be an audio engineer and 1 was a producer for hip house and\ncommercial dance crap. After the music was\nused in the night we used to use the studio for\npsychedelic experiments. We started Air Liquide\nat this time and we just had fun in the studio,\nnot thinking about what we wanted to do, just\nfreaking out with the instruments; making\nsounds.\nWhy the name Air Liquide?\nThis is a kind of cool story. I had this fucking\nposer car (Oh yeah! Fucking, that's a bad word\nin the UK); a convertible; really fast. 1 was going\nhome in this car at 160 mph and 1 was going on\nthe autobahn in Germany and there was this\ntruck called Air Liquide (a French chemical com-p any) and another car went in my lane so 1 had\nto swerve so as not to hit the truck.\nI missed the Air Liquide truck by about 15\ncm. It was really fast, really close and 1 didn't hit\nit. So 1 saw this sign Air Liquide and 1 didn't hit\nit, and I thought that maybe we should do a band like this.\nWhat were your roots? What music inspired you\ninto Air Liquide?\nAh that's really bad! Jammin' Unit comes\nfrom rock; psychedelic rock music and I come\nfrom NWA, Public Enemy. That's really bad to\nsay but actually it's true...\nWhy is it bad?\nBecause I have to tell everyone I'm not from\nthe ghetto and I'm kind of happy about that. I don't like burning trash cans and I don't like to\nshoot people. 1 don't like to diss people or\nwhatever, but the energy from Public Enemy is\namazing. Public Enemy six years ago was like\nmodern can music; like cut-up techniques,\ninsane psychedelic electronic music. I didn't like\nthe attitude, but I liked the sound, the groove\nand the funk. So this was mind-blowing for me.\nActually everyone said that white people cannot\nbe funky. I said \"Yeah sure honey! You're right.\nLet's do it!\"\nSo do you consider your music is funky?\nHopefully! Maybe not live, but when I produce records, I'm working hardcore. Someone\nasked me how I can describe my music and 1\nsaid, \"It's insane music from insane boys for\ninsane girls. I make girls music!\"\nJust for girls?\nYeah. Actually yeah! I really love it when they\nall shake their asses in front of the stage. This is\ntotally important for me.\nIs that what funk is?\nYeah sure! It's sex.\nApart from that is there a message? What is\nyour music about?\nMy partner says no message, actually my\nmessage is sex.\nIn what way?\nPsychedelic, like fucking on LSD. That's big\nfun! 1 try to make music like that.\nAnd tonight you're playing live. Can you explain\nyour live style?\nIt's really funny because we jam together on\nelectronic instruments, and if everything works\nout fine, we press start and all the machines\nwork. So we start to combine electronic\nsounds; make rhythm, make atmosphere.\nYesterday night 1 saw a live PA from another UK\nact, and this was full playback and I had to\nleave. I felt so bad for him. He put in a DAT and\ntried to play over it. I went back to the hotel and\nwent to bed. 1 thought, \"This cannot be true! I saw that it was full playback, and I guess that\nlots of other people saw that.\nSo yours is totally live and totally unrehearsed?\nYeah if you give yourself a chance to be\ntotally bad, you have a chance to be really good,\nand if you put in a DAT and press play you cannot be bad or good, you can just be boring.\nThat's all. If your only artistic contribution is to\nchange volume and 1Q,I 'll see it and I 'll die.\nWhat do you think when critics say that electronic music cannot be raw and live and danger-o us? In this case they have no idea. I mean electronic instruments are instruments. You have to\nlearn instruments, and you have to play and perform with instruments, and I don't care if these\ninstruments have five strings or two hundred\nknobs or whatever. So you can play on a mixing\nboard just like on a guitar. You have to love it.\nI performed in Zurich, Switzerland. There\nwas a hardcore girl; a lesbian with short hair and\ntattoos everywhere, and she was standing\nbehind me and when 1 stopped performing she\ncame and gave a big hug to me. She started to\nkiss me and said that it was the most amazing\nthing with electronic instruments that she had\never seen. She was the singer of a Zurich punk\ngroup. She said, \"That was so cool! I never knew\nthat was possible with electronic instruments.\"\nDo you also DJ?\nNo! I'm too stupid to do that! You need to\nhave money in your pocket to buy new records\nand stuff. I don't have that, it's too difficult for\nme to go into a record shop and buy new\nrecords and listen to new records. It's not my\ndeal.\nYou release your music on many different labels.\nWhy is this? Why don't you make music for one\nlabel so people know where to find your music?\nI don't believe in labels. I believe in friends.\nWhen friends come to me and want to release a24 June 1998 MUSIC 37\nINTERVIEW\ntalks to Air Liquid e certain record I say, \"Oh yeah, sure. Let's go!\" If\nbusiness people come to me and say, \"We have\nto release this and this and this.\" I say, \"OK.\nHow much?\"\n/ read that you were a student of an academy of\nelectronic music...\nThat's true but it's not important.\n.../ also read that you went through tough times\nbefore Air Liquide? You had sounds you invented stolen, and a company that you made hit\ncommercial records for went bankrupt and you\nnever saw the money of your work. Music journalists have justified your hard and raw sound to\nthis sequence of events. Is that true?\nNo. As I told you we're lying the whole time.\nEvery day a new truth. But we are really bad sarcastic people. Actually I think this is kind of\nCologne style to have really bad humour. We\nput this in music.\nA good friend of mine plays in a band and he\nsaid, \"Whatever any newspaper writes about\nyou, make sure it's not the truth!\"\nWhy?\nBecause the more people people can talk\nabout you, the more important this is for your\npublicity, if you tell them the truth, it's kind of\nboring; like, \"1 was born there, and I think this,\nand I did this!\" It's boring! But if people start to\ntalk about you and it's not true and there's a big\nrumour and some hype, then this is fun!\"\n.But don't you think that there are people who\nwere influenced by your music and want to\nknow about you because of your music; the\ntruth?\nI definitely appreciate that people like our\nmusic, but they don't know what's going on if\nthey haven't been in Cologne and went partying\nwith us for six days. And they don't know how\nto die. It's true. It sounds dramatic.\nWe've been out partying every day for a couple of years, and at six o 'clock in the morning when we are totally blasted we go and produce some tracks, and then we go to sleep, and\nthen we invent ourselves again. So everyday we\nhave a new truth. It's really difficult to explain it.\nPeople who haven't been in Cologne for a few\ndays, hanging out with us don't believe it. We\ntell them, \"It's easy to drink 400 bottles of beer\nin two days.\" They say, \"You're fucking idiots.\nYou don't know what you're talking about.\"\nApart from this party-vibe thing, you made a track called Twice Zero is Zero, with a vocal\ntrack that contained some quite deep sayings. Is\nyour music also about that in some ways?\nMary Applegate who did all the vocals for us\nis my ex-girlfriend. All the lyrics were about our\nrelationship because at that time she was married and I was married, and this was a really bad\nrelationship. She got divorced and 1 got\ndivorced. I'm not allowed to see my children\nanymore because of this relationship. All these\nvocals from this time, like \"This is not a mind\ntrip, this is a body journey\" were really coming\nfrom the heart. It's not like psychedelic bullshit,\nit's an honest rock'n 'roll vibe. It's about our\nlives.\nIt's a really bad thing to talk about!\nIs techno serious or just party music?\nFor me when I'm performing live I'm an\nentertainer. I have to try and entertain the people on the dancefloor. When I'm doing records\nit's a totally different thing. I can do whatever I'd like to do and you have the chance to say yes or\nno to my records. If I perform live in front of fifty\nor five hundred people they all want to have a good time. So 1 feel like Frank Sinatra and 1 have\nto give these people a good time. I make a slightly different sound then when I'm producing\nrecords.\nI have a really bad feeling to fuck around\nwith my audience, to say, \"I'm an artist and I 'll\nshow you my art. You dig it or die! 1 don't care!\"\nPeople say it is easy to make music using com-put ers. What do you think about these criticisms? I don't know anyone who was able to switch\non a computer and make good music instantly.\nThere's only two types of music for me; bad\nmusic and good music. I don't care if it's rock\nmusic or played with violins or whatever.\nWhat do you think of DJing as a live spectacle?\nDJing is not live. It's like painting a wall. You\ncan paint a wall perfectly; like white or green or\nwhatever, and you don't see any drops on it, no\nshades. That's a DJ! There are musicians. They\nmake records for DJs to play. They are inventing\nthe colours and shades for DJs to play.\nIn the record industry people say that DJs are\nmusicians. Do you agree?\nI don't want to diss DJs. They do a good job\nto bring music to people but they are not pro-duc ers. Does it not make you angry that some DJs get\nall the attention and make all the money if\nthey're not being creative?\nThat's OK with me! It's not my way. I 've\nnothing against someone like Sven Vath who\nmakes lots of money by putting together other\npeople's tracks. 1 don't care. It's good to promote to electronic music to the masses. But\nwhen these DJs think that they are God, 1 have a problem.\nIn the end it doesn't matter, because if people come together to have a good time, you\nshouldn't have to worry to tell them, \"Oh actually I made this track!\"\nI don't think 1 want all the credit. I feel bad.\nI have a problem when kids come to me and\nsay, \"Actually I came from Sweden to see your\nshow tonight!\". I feel that it was a bad idea. Why\ndid they do that? They should have stayed in\nSweden and watched MTV. It puts a lot of pressure on me. They came from Sweden and payed\na thousand pounds to see me live, so I have to\nbe really good. I cannot do that!\nAl;ck\n\n"

    "content": "If1 was given a lot of money and the afternoon off, this is what I would prepare for a large evening in (with 3 or 4 others). The\nsouffl e is another example of my courgette\nfetish but its delicately subtle flavour and\nephemeral ly light texture is well worth the effort.\nThe beef dish is another kettle of fish entire-ly. Each ingredient has its own strong and distinct\nflavour but after steaming away together the truffle infuses the fillet whilst the whole is sweetened\nby the foi e gras to create something quite\nsuperb. A heady brew to be enjoyed with a heady\nBordeaux.\nThe last course is a very light sorbet designed\nto revive the senses by its sharp purity.\nGood luck and have a gastronomic summer.\nCOURGETTE SOUFFLE\n<r2 medium courgette sT50 g flour\nT50g butter\n\u00b0\" 1 tsp mustard (powder or paste)\nT250 ml milk\n*\" 150 g feta cheese, crumbled\n\u00ae\" 3 t bl grated Parmesan\n*\u2022 4 eggs, separated\nNo self respecting souffl e should have any consistency so first finely grate the courgette s, leave them in a bowl with a couple of generous\npinches of salt to bleed for half an hour.\nWhile you're waiting start on the white sauce by\ngently melting the butter in a thick saucepan.\nWhen the butter starts spitting, stir in the flour\nand mustard. Fry this paste for 1 minute before\nremoving the pan from the heat. Mix in the milk\none tablespoon at a time, making sure the\npaste has become homogenous before adding\nmore. This is to prevent the white sauce\nbecoming lumpy (if despite everything you do\nget lumps try blending it if possible). Once\nyou've added about half the milk it's probably\nsafe to simply pour the rest in and give a good\nspin. Return the pan to the stove and slowly\nbring to the boil, stirring often to stop the bottom burning. Simmer for a minute.\nIn a spare moment, reach over and rinse the\ncourgette in cold water. Then drain them really\nwell by squeezing all the juice out of the mush\nwith your hands. This is violent, but necessary.\nPut the white sauce into a large bowl and\nmix in the courgette s, cheeses and egg yolk.\nSeason with a small amount of black pepper\nand give a good stir.\nThis is probably as good a time as any to put\nthe oven on to preheat. You'll need to get it up\nto 180\u00b0C or Gas Mark 5.\nNow for a good egg white beating session.\nThese need to be beaten up until they form\n\"soft peaks\". I reckon this silly term means that\na spike of the foam sort of curls over and dies\naway in about 20-30 seconds. Anyway, the best\nway of achieving this is to use ab zz zzz machine\nwith the appropriate attachment. If you haven't got access to one, use one of those funky hand-powered whisks that you get your fingers\ncaught in. The last resort is to use a couple of\nforks held side by side in the hand. This works\n(with a lot of effort) by whipping the egg whites\naround the bowl and at the same time lifting the\nforks up and out to try and incorporate as much\nair in the liquid as possible. Make sure the bowl\nyou are using is absolutely dry before you put\nthe egg whites in to increase your chances of a class result.\nThe final preparation is to fold the egg\nwhites into the white sauce mixture. This is supposed to be a delicate operation. Do not try to\nget a completely uniform mixture: your souffl e will come out a complete flop. Instead pour the\nbeaten egg whites onto the sauce. Then with a wooden spoon scrape along the bottom of the\nbowl, pull it out and dump your excavations on\ntop of the egg whites. Repeat 5 or six times.\nNow to the moulds. Your can use one large\nmould (big enough to contain 11) or, better, four\nsmaller (1/4 1) ones. They should be round and\nceramic which has the most appropriate heat\nconductivity. Make sure they are perfectly clean\nand dry and then smother a good layer of butter all over the sides and bottom. Fill them %\nfull with the souffl e mixture and place in the\noven.\nThe souffl es should take 25 minutes and be\na delicate shade of golden brown, puffing out of\nthe moulds like chefs' hats. Do NOT under any\ncircumstance open the oven until the souffl es are done as any draft or cold wave will make the\nsouffl e hang its head and shrivel.\nServe the souffl e straight from the oven\nThat horse must be around\nhere somewhere ...\nBOEUF ROSSIGNY\n*\" 1 kg prime fillet of beef (sirloin)\n*\" 250 gf oie gras d 'oie\n1 truffle (tuber mel a no spor um) \u00ae\" 1 roll puff pastry\nUnlike the last recipe this is a piece of cake.\nUnfortunately you might have to extend your\noverdraft to pay for the ingredients. They won't be very easy to find either, unless you go to the\nPhake Pharaoh's Emporium. Foie gras is a goose's liver cooked and preserved in its own\nfat. Truffle is a black mushroom which grows\nunderground in 1\" round lumps. As for the puff\npastry, you could mess about making your own\n(find the recipe at) but I really recommend you\nfind a commercial version. They work fine.\nTake the sheet of puff pastry and roll it\naround the fillet (pat it dry with a tea cloth first).\nTrim the pastry but leave a1\" overlap to seal.\nTake the fillet out and spread the foi e gras over\nthe pastry (not on the edges). Slice the truffle\ninto very thin (see-through) slices and lay them\non to the foi e gras. Season with ground pepper\nand finally place the fillet in the middle.\nSwiftly prepare an egg wash (1 egg yolk and\ntwo tablespoons of water mixed together),\nwrap the pastry around the fillet and seal the\nedges with the egg wash. To make a real\nimpression, draw a pretty picture on the pastry\nby scoring it with a very sharp knife or cutter\n(don't cut deeper than about 2mm) and brush\nwith the rest of the egg wash.\nRoast in the oven (preheated to 180\u00b0C or\nGas Mark 5, handily the same as for the souffl e) for 1 hour.\nServe in slices with some light vegetables\nlike runner beans and boiled new potatoes or\nsomething.\nG RAM O LATA\n*\" 1 kg red currants\n\u00ae\" 1 kg raspberries\nW,300g sugar\nYou need to start this one early. Again the best\ntool for this is a mixer/blender type thing. The\nalternative is a large bowl and a potato masher.\nEither way you need to extract the juice from\nthe fruit. Grind, crush or mash the berries. Drain\nas much juice out with a sieve and then put the\nremaining slurry into a thin, clean tea cloth( or\nmuslin cloth if you've got it). Pick the cloth up\nby the corners and twist it round and round to\nsqueeze as much liquid out as possible. Add the\nsugar to the juices and stir until it has dissolved.\nPour the liquid into a wide shallow container\n(the dreaded Tupperware is very good for this)\nand place in the freezer. Check progress every\nVz hour or so. When a thin film has formed take\na fork and break up the surface of the ice by raking it. Return to the freezer and repeat every Vz\nhour. Always rake in the same direction. The\naims to get a fairly dry slush with long thin crystals. I can't tell you how long this should take as\nit depends on the number of lost frozen pea\nbags there are in your freezer.\nServe in chilled glass coupes with\nchampagne.\n\n"

    "content": "16 NEWS REVIEW 24 June 1998\nN/ ui campo ei is uncovered the World Health\nOrganisation's cannabis cover-up.\nEvil stuff, mate: I wouldn't touch it.\n1110: 6 March 98\nTed Dead\nFelix was guilty of stating the obvious when an article on page 2 entitled \" CC Us Nobody Cares: It's Official\" utterly failed to raise any\neyebrows. Crap news of the week\nwas the death of Dermot Morgan, C4's Father Ted: a minute's silence\nwas held in the Felix office,\nalthough that might just have been\nbecause nobody could think of anything to say.\n1111: 13 March 98\nLingere\nIC managed to bag more research\nfunding than any other university,\nincluding Oxford or Cambridge,\nbegging the question: how much did this cost IC in bribes? Sherlock\nHolmes was called in to examine a case of blackmail as College\ndemanded 70% of the proceeds\nfrom the walkway STA Travel shop:\nAndrew Heeps described it as \"the\nworst day of my Presidency\". Felix\nsuspects that he was just suffering\nfrom a hangover. The ICU Football\nteam systematically trashed a hotel, incurring ICU over a thousand pounds in costs - apparently\nthis sum included a bill for \"an\nentire silver cutlery set and a paint-ing, which had been torn down and\nurinated over\". Lovely. Other lovely\nhappenings included a vary fetching picture of one Anjit Chaudhari\non the walkway, dressed in lingerie\nas a result of being snapped up at\nthe Rag Slave Auction.\nObservant people may have\nnoticed the spot above the T in\nFelix....\n1112: 25 March 98\nDrugs ill\n... leading to the shock arrest of\nFelix editor Jeremy Thomson, who was reported to have impregnated\neach copy of Felix 1111 with LSD.\nLuckily it turned out to be a hoax,\nbut this did not stop you gullible lot\nhanding in a large number of copies\nof 1111 to Security. (Shame on\nanyone who tried to ingest the\ncover. You know who you are, you\npliable fools.) More drug news this\nweek appeared in the shape of a pro-cannabis march in Hyde Park:\nvarious Felixers were present (pure-ly for journalistic purposes, you understand), but none of them\ncould remember what happened.\n1113: 1 May 98\nBeer\nIt transpired during the Easter holidays that there was \"Trouble Ahead\nfor Campus Renaissance\", describing delays in the construction of the\n\u00a3 5 8 m Biomedical Sciences build-ing. Hands up all those who didn't predict that anyway. Imperial also\nmanaged to leap ahead of Oxford\nin the Financial Times' University\nRankings, but I dare say there was\nno criterion in the rating system\ninvolving availability of women. Or accommodation. Or, for that mat-ter, quality of student newspaper.\nAlso occurring over Easter was\ngood news for the medical schools'\nbars: a private company stepped in\nwith a tender for both Charing\nCross and St. Mary's, rescuing\nthem from an uncertain future. This\ncame just in time for the students,\nwho might otherwise had to have\ncontemplated a week at College,\nsober.\n1114: 8 May 98\nBomb Scare!\nNews this week was pitiful: the\nbest front page story we could\nmanage was entitled: \"IC Suffers\nWorst Ever News Drought\".\nDespite this, some amusing gu b bins did occur; 1C Security, the\nBomb Squad and the police were\ncalled in to defuse a bomb in the\nSherfield Building, which may have\nbeen placed to interfere with a Biology final in the Great Hall. The\ncomposition of the bomb was not\nquite as chuckle some as last year's effort: aluminium cans and foil\nreplaced the memorable overhead\nprojector scam.\nA burglary attempt in Elec. Eng.\nwas thwarted, saving thousands of\npounds worth of computer equip-ment, but I rather wish they had\nstolen my coursework before\nescaping. More important news\nthis week came in the shape of a collection of possible cures for cancer (but don't start smoking yet,\nkids.)\n1115: 15 May 98\nPut That Fag Out\nA group of Wardens and SubWardens put forward the proposal\nthat smoking should be banned\ncompletely in all College residences. This really very cheeky suggestion was treated with the contempt it deserved - the campaign\nfailed. There was terrible news of\nstudents being shot in Indonesia,\nwhile campaigning for the resignation of President Suharto. Six were\nkilled. Think yourselves lucky.\nPhysicists might have been\ninterested in the story describing\nhow Australian astronomers had\ndiscovered a supposed new black\nhole. Let's hope they haven't made\na Hubble-type mistake, where the\nscientists forgot to take off the lens\ncap.\n1117: 29 May 98\nResign\nThere was trouble all round this\nweek. Dave Wharton, DP F&S elect,\ndecided to resign his post due to\nacademic difficulties. The groans\naround the Union were broken only\nby the far-off chuckling from those\nat St. Mary's who voted' New Election'. Bad news sprouted for\nKing's College, whose Union\nManager was sacked for numerous\noffences \" including fraud and\ndrunken behaviour\". This man would probably fit in well in\nAmerica, where students staged\nprotests against alcohol bans, and\nfaced tear gas.\nOther negative vibes included\nthe announcement of Tube strikes,\nand worst of all, no Felix for two\nweeks...\n1118: 5 June 98\nNoah's Hall\nAnother indication of the complete\nlack of student interest in the running of the Union came to light\nwhen the ICU AGM was terminated\nby a shout of, \" Quorum!\" from\nMe ch. Eng. student Andy Southern.\nHe was supposedly protesting\nabout the lack of student interest at\nthe meeting, but I suspect he was\njust clearing his throat.\nThere was more bad news for\nBrabazon House, the Charing Cross\nhall, when rain flooded the base-ment. (Why is it so hard to keep\nwater out? Why?!) This apparently\nled to a scramble during which\npeople had to fill bags with their\npossessions and take them upstairs\nto the safety of dry land. It sounds\nrather like a game show: anybody\nfancy the licence?\nIssue 1119: 24 June 98\nIt's This One\nYou're reading it. Errm... something\nabout STOIC being on television.\nThis week, I did my laundry and\ncaught a horrible cough. Look, just\ngo read the news section, OK?\n\n"

    "content": "18 INTERVIEW 24 June 1998 24 June 1998 INTERVIEW 19\nIalways had the Rector down as a chap of\nsound judgement, but after he agreed to\nbe interviewed by yours truly for a second\ntime, I'm not so sure. Perhaps I don't scare\nthe Suite Five posse anymore? Surely not.\nAnyway, I donned the flak jacket and headed for the inner sanctum.\nUnlike last year, when the aim was more\nthe England football squad. There have been\nproblems, as everyone realises, not least the\nfact that the building is late. Naturally, I assumed that the Rector would attribute this to\ninsignificant difficulties, sweeping the issue\nunder the carpet. I was very wrong. \"We have\nbeen very disappointed over the performance\nof the builders... undertakings that we have\nbeen given over deadlines and achievements\nhave not been met in a number of cases.\" In\nImperial-speak, this is strong stuff. \"Although in\nthe appropriate sub-contractors have not\nproperly thought out the systems that they\nwere putting in\" and were \"not co-ordinated\nby the management... in the last few\nmonths, virtually all the changes have been of\nthe latter kind.\" Penalty clauses have been\nmooted before, and it was comforting to\nhear that somebody did, after all, have the\nsense to put into the original contracts, making payments due to the College in the event\nof problems. \"We shall try to recover unjustifiable costs or increases in cost that were\nattributable to the unreasonable actions of\nothers.\" Methinks that Sir Ron may be re le interview with the\nto stick the boot in, I meant to pose incisive\nquestions, the better to elicit Sir Ron's views\non how the year has gone. Clearly the big\nissue at Imperial has been the medical mer g er, made tangible by the construction of the\nBMS. The changes have gone beyond the\nbricks and mortar, requiring a major overhaul\nof the existing administration of the medical\nschools. This was \"bigger than we thought.\nAlthough we knew the institutions we were\nmerging with, we did not appreciate quite\nhow large the job would be.\" Particularly with\nregard to the finances, this has \"led to perfectly understandable dissatisfaction within\nthe medical school.\" This is being resolved by\n\"constructing a new division across the old\naccounting structure.\" Sounds fine, but\ndepending on who you speak to, this process\nis far from complete, with little difficulties\npersisting. Little difficulties such as not\nknowing to whom bills should be sent. I trust\nthis will be sorted out before it builds into\nquite a nasty surprise. All in all, given the disparate tribes that were, in some cases joined\nin a shotgun wedding, it seems to be bedding\ndown reasonably. \"The first year of ICSM has\nbeen tougher than most people thought, but\nalthough there are still problems ahead, quite\na few are behind us... the next mountain to\nbe climbed is the arrival of the freshmen in\nOctober\", a point on which most people at\nSouth Ken would surely agree. Academically,\nthere are challenges as well, he said, the\nbiggest being \"ensuring that this new and\nvery ambitious course meets [the students']\nexpectations and ours.\"\nThe BMS building has been the subject of\nmore column inches than the peccadilloes of\na formal legal sense, the obligations lie with\nthose we have been dealing with, some of the\nfault lies with us\", he conceded. The loss of Prof\nJohn Archer to Herriot-Watt, former Deputy\nRector who was responsible for the project was\na particular difficulty. Acquainting his successor,\nProf Bill Wakeham, took a little time, and could\nexplain some of the problems. One annoyance\nhighlighted by all involved in the project has\nbeen the vacillations of some of the groups destined for the building. Schal say that this has\ncaused considerable hassle, and Sir Ron said\nthat \"we probably did not exercise tough enough\n^ We have been very\ndisappointed over the\nperformance of the\nbuilders...^\ndiscipline on the departments... to specify their\nrequirements in sufficient detail, early, and make\nthem stick.\" To their credit, the building appears\nto be extensively future-proofed, which is another way of saying that college pitched for twice\nwhat they needed and got away with it. The constant tweaking of the design inevitably delays\nwork, and modifications \"derived from users\nchanging their mind... are inexcusable.\" He claimed that recent changes, responsible in part\nfor the late opening were \"generated because\ngated from Schal's Christmas card premier\ndivision. However, in the final analysis, the\nBMS will come in on budget or thereabouts,\nwhich for IC is a miracle.\nThe Dearing Report affects all universi-ties, but has particular relevance to the\nRector, since he helped to produce it. It contains some \"Very good points, and some\npoints about which I'm less enthusiastic.\"\nElaborating, he said that the short timescale,\ncoupled with the time to bring the \"deliberately inexpert\" committee up to speed left\nonly about twelve months to compile the\nreport. He said that probably the most\nimportant achievement was the demonstration \"that their claim that universities were\nsignificantly underfunded has been accept-ed\" by influential bodies, such as the CBI. On tuition fees, he said that \"if you accepted the\nposition that the financial position was bad,\nand you put that together with the assertion\nof all the political parties that there will be no\nmore money, there is unfortunately only one\noutcome... student fees\", a decision for\nwhich \"no one was enthusiastic.\" It wasn't all\nnegative from the perspective of the stu-dents, he claimed. Some were pleased by the\n\"recognition that a number of the assertions\nthat had been made about the poor quality\nof services some universities were providing\nwas justified.\" Sir Ron saw \"appa ling\" examples of academic practice in some universities,\ninconceivable to those at Imperial. That is not\nto say that IC is without fault. There are \"cer-tain areas where I believe we are seriously\ndeficient,\" but sadly my skills garnered from\nthe Ladybird Book of Enemy Interrogation\nfailed to elicit an example.\nThe non-academic services offered by IC\nare a little more clear cut. \"Iam not satisfied\nwith the facilities that we provide our stu-dents\"; a statement that many would claim\nwas an affirmation of the blindingly obvious,\nbut it is reassuring to hear such an unambiguous assessment of the situation.\nAccommodation is being upgraded, at long\nlast, with Southwell and Beit Hall first in the\nframe. No news yet of Southside, though\nbricks and mortar are already in place. This will\nbe done once the money has been found. The\nbiggest project on the horizon is the refurbishment of the Royal School of Mines. Described\nby Sir Ron as \"the biggest refurbishment the\nMI am not satisfied\nwith the facilities that\nwe provide our\nstudents...^\nCollege has ever done\", he predicts that project could cost up to \u00a3 4 0 million and in terms\nof disruption \"will be a nightmare.\" Many people feel that College is already a perennial\nbuilding site with scant consideration give to\nview of old cynics like me, who saw all the\nclassic hallmarks of an asset strip, the \"principal reason [for the merger] is that it offers\nan entry into agriculture\", which Sir Ron sees\nas very important. \"I believe that agriculture\nin the next century is going to be very different to agriculture in this century.\" Research\ninto crops that goes beyond genetic modi fi cation, taking into account considerations\nsuch as atmospheric and soil variations, is\nsomething in which the Rector feels that 1C should be heavily involved. This dovetails\nneatly with the idea that the two big areas for\nresearch in the next century will be environmental and medical science, the new cross-disciplinary areas that he feels should dissolve the boundaries of science more applicable to the nineteenth century. All this should\nhelp to boost the College's standing, already\nindicated by the Financial Times Survey.\nThough pleased by the result, he made that\npoint that \"I can construct league tables just\nas defensible as the FT's that could put\nby Simon Bak there are muttering s on the grapevine that\nsomething might happen; for my money, the\nonly refurbishment possible for Southside Halls\nrequires a wrecking ball and dynamite.\nPlans for decent sports facilities are back\non the agenda, after the failure of the planning\napplication for the Linstead tennis courts.\nWhile he claimed that the reasons for rejection\n- increased traffic - were \"bizarre\", Sir Ron\nsaid it was probably wise not to press the issue\nas \"some battles are not worth winning.\" Hell\nhath no fury like the Knightsbridge Association\nscorned, apparently. Instead, the plan is to\nbuild on top of the existing Sports Centre, a non-trivial task given that building's legendary\nfoundations. Lottery bids seem to have gone\nout of the window, removing the need for a lot\nof features of minimal use to the College, but\nessential for such applications. All this should\nenable a lower cost solution, and the Rector\nsaid he expected some action within \"three or\nfour years.\"\nOn the subject of Lottery bids, he confirmed that the Music&. Arts Centre bid, a dead duck from the outset in the opinion of\nmany, has failed. Again, this removes the need\nto spend a fortune to enable the public to get\nin and cuts the cost enormously, given that the\nthe needs of the inmates, who have to work\naround a constant stream of noise, grime and\ngeneral tat tines s.He replied that he has\n\"never known a situation where it has been\nremotely satisfactory,\" but did not offer any\nspecific suggestions as to how this could be\naddressed. I hope that our friends in Estates\nwill pay particular attention to this as they\ndraw plans for the RS M. When finished, the\nbuilding will house the Huxley School and the\nManagement School, freeing up their highly\ndesirable Exhibition Road home, which will be\nleased out as part of a plan \"to make more use\nof academic buildings\", turning residential\nproperties \"into revenue streams.\" A very\nrefreshing attitude indeed, and eminently\nsensible.\nAs part of Imperial's plan to take over the\nworld, which has already seen the plundering\nof London's medical schools, our next target\nis little Wye College, near Ashford in Kent. A report on the proposed merger will go to the\nGovernors next week, but it will recommend\nthe proposal, leading to full incorporation by 1\nAugust 2000, if Wye agree. Contrary to the\nOxford at the top, or Cambridge, or\nImperial.\" Nevertheless, it's better to criticise\nleague tables when you're near the top, a point with which the Rector agrees.\nI could go on for several more pages,\nsuch was the range of topics that we cov-ered, but space is against us. We discussed\nmy pet subject, Sherfield, and beyond Sir\nRon's assertion that \"no area is perfect\", a view with which I have a degree of sympathy,\nI was worried to hear that he feels that we probably spend too little on admin. This is\nsomething that may well be addressed by in\nthe future. Overall, I sensed that the Rector\nis, slowly but surely, coming round to my way\nof thinking(l). It has, by common consent\nbeen a fairly good year, topped off nicely by\nBirthday Honours for Professors Jarman and\nKibble and the IC Summer Ball, for which I should now be getting ready. Next year will\nbe a real challenge, when the medical hordes\ndescend. I wait with baited breath.\n\n"

    "content": "42\nREVIEWS\nFILM 24 June 1998\nGREASE\nStarring: John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John,, Stockard Channing\nDirector: Randal Kleiser\nI thought I'd seen Crease. I 've\ncertainly seen Crease 2 and Saturday Night Fever, 1 recall\nmost of the songs and the image of\nOlivia Newton John in tight leather\ntrousers has been with me since\npre-puberty. But the minute the\ncheesy cartoon intro began, I suddenly realised. I have never actually seen Crease - the greatest disco\nflick ever made.\nThe truth is, that's not such a bad thing. All I ever needed to\nknow about Crease I knew well\nbefore I came to the cinema. There's no Hitchcock like sus-pens e, no intricate sub-plots like a Ridley Scott film and no trademark\nTarantino violence, it's just a musical like any other: a series of set\npieces, very loosely tied to a cheesy story that you've seen far\ntoo many times alte a dy, thank you very much. If you really want care, then it\ngoes something like this: Travolta is\nthe 'coolest' of the T Birds, a highschool gang who hang out with the\nPink Ladies. He met Newton-John\nmm\nI \u2022HP^\nduring the summer holiday and now she's moved to his school.\nHowever, she doesn't fit in with the\nJohn Travolta - style on a stick\n'cool' scene. Meanwhile, rival gang\nthe Scorpions want to race the T Birds, and there's a National Dance\nTV show coming to Rydall High. But\nto be honest, none of that really\nmatters, if you want an intricate,\nclever story, rent out The Usual\nSuspects. Grease is not about the\nstory, it's about 'avi n'ala rf. You may have heard about the\ncult following of Showgirls. People\njust watch to take the piss out of it.\nCrease is all that and so much\nmore - it has a universal \"So\ncheesy, it's great\" appeal. When it\ncame to classics like \"Greased\nLightning\", everyone did the clapp y bit. You know, THAT bit. And who could forget the hot-dog cartoon in\nthe background during \"Stranded at\nthe Drive-in\"?\nIt\"s not quite as groovy as it\nprobably was twenty years ago\n(before some of us were even\nborn) and at times you'll probably\nfeel really sheepish while watching\nit. If you know the songs and take a few like-minded mates, then just\ngo along and have a laugh. After all,\nyou've only got your credibility to\nlose. 1*1\nAndy\nRED CORNER\nStarring: Richard Gere, Bai Ling\nDirector: jon Avnet\nImagine waking up in Bejing next\nto the corpse of an exotic beauty with whom you spent an\nentirely pleasant evening just a few\nhours earlier. Then you are not so\ngently removed by a significant\nportion of the local police force to\na place of detention where, having\nonly a whiskey clouded recollection\nof the previous night's events and a few words of Chinese, you can do nothing except pray for the mercy\nof a judicial system not known for\nit's leniency. By now you're probably pretty confused and altogether\nterrified, while the news that those\nguilty of a capital offence are generally shot within a week of sentencing is unlikely to help lift your\nspirits.\nJack Moore, though, is made of\nsterner stuff. Played by Richard\nGere, he is in Bejing to close a hugely lucrative satellite television\ndeal, the first to be sanctioned by\nthe Chinese government. The fact\nthat this makes him a prime target\nfor a set-up is not lost on Gere, so\nwhen he is arrested he rather rapidly resolves to clear his name.\nAgainst the wishes of his court-Richard Gere's award winning \"confused\" look.\nappointed defence lawyer Bai Ling\nwho knows that a confession will\nbring a lighter sentence, jack insists\non an innocent plea, even threatening to defend himself if she will not\ncapitulate. The scene is set for an\nextremely conventional courtroom\nbased tale of conspiracy, albeit one\nin which the cultural differences of\nthe leading characters could add a little interest. Unfortunately, they\ndon't. The issue of the contrasting\nbackground of the lawyer and the\naccused is crowbar red into their\nconversations in the form of largely\nirrelevant exchanges on the subject\nof the murder rate in America and\nthe like. What is more, the conspiracy which is sometimes enough to\nhold one's attention in a film of this\nsort is pathetically poorly hidden.\nWhen we find out who is responsible for Gere's misfortune, it comes\nas no surprise at all. Presumably,\nthe novel setting is supposed to\nexcuse this, but it really doesn't come close.\nGere's cocky reaction to his\npredicament is irksome in itself, but\nthe impression that it is born of the\nrighteous indignation which any\nAmerican would feel makes it even\nharder to swallow. Rather than\nserve as an aspect of his nightmarish situation, disturbing footage of\nan execution seems to be included\nmainly to highlight the swift severity of the Chinese legal system.\nAfter all, it's far more humane to\nkeep prisoners on death row for\nyears while their lives hang in the\nbalance, isn't it?\nAll this turns what could have\nbeen an affecting personal story\nwith some political significance into\na deeply awful film with a bit of\ncrass soap boxing thrown in. Richard Gere has been outspoken\nin the past on the human rights\nrecord of the Chinese government,\nparticularly their behaviour in Tibet,\nand here he finds himself in a position to make a difference. Sadly,\nhowever, Red Corner does no one any favours. [|\nSimon\n\n"

HOME\nGiven that last week the final\nhad been rained off,\nTuesdays forecast was scrutinised by everyone. Surely we were\nin luck this time - the TV weather\nmap didn't show a rain cloud anywhere in the greater counties. Sadly,\nKetley had had it coming out of his\narse again and by the time we got to\nMot spur park we needed a Kayak to\ninspect the track.\nNever the less, after\nan hour's wait, the\nflood waters dispersed and Jon\n(arch negotiator)\ntwisted the\numpires' arms into\nplaying - much to\nthe disappointment\nof Royal Holloway\nwho were busy\nwatching Neighbours.\nThe early\nHolloway scorecard\nmade delightful\nreading with Steve\nTrussels' raw pace and Ra]s tricky\nseaming proving too much for the\nupper order and they were reduced\nto 24 for 3. A successful rear-guard\naction was staged by some of the\nHolloway middle order big hitters\nbut owing to some fine catches\n(especially by Andy, managing to\nkeep his eyes on the ball as it\nreturned from the upper tropos-p here) and to Nigel who, with his\nuncanny ability to pitch the ball right\nin a batsmen's gonads, soon reduced their batting lineup in number and fertility. Things were going\nwell it seemed until skipper Andy\ncame on and felt sporting enough to\nThe Joyful cricket captain hold\naloft the cup.\nbowl three overs of complete pies,\nand the Holloway batting stuttered\nto a half decent (well pretty piss-poor, actually) score of 114 all out.\nFired up by an inspiring speech\nfrom the skipper, our own innings\ngot off to a questionable start of 5\nfor 4, leaving us in the strange position of having Jon, Yann, Imran and\nAndy muster only a single run between\nthem. With the\nwickets tumbling,\nthe supporters wandering inside to\nwatch the football,\nthe captain busy\nsmashing up the\nchanging room and\nthe whole of the\nlower order hastily\npadding up disaster\nseemed inevitable.\nBut Raj, our resident\nSri Lankan beefy\nbastard gave their\nbowling some heat\nand pulled off some\nstrokes that had the\nheight and distance to make a respectable 3-iron look pretty poor.\nRaj pulled the team out from the\ndepths of deepest doo doo with an\nawesome display of power-house\nbatting. A mention also to Alex who\nsupported the other end of the\nwicket with equal style and power,\nbut who was very badly dropped by\na man in a black velvet shirt standing just in front of the score box. So the day was ours, Holloway\nskulked off back to their union (lucky\nbastards) and for the fourth time in\n69 years the IC 1 st XI (or as we call\nit now, the Raj Honourary 1st XI)\nreturned as UL Champions\n1\nQ's Walking Club training for the\nlast fixture of the year had been\nI intense right up to the big day\non 7 June. A new competition for\nthe boyz and g rrr ls, set out to win\nthe 10 km walk and leave a lasting\nimpression. In the end only the\nfourth team - The Faggy Fourthsmade it to the starting line.\nKnown previously to walk long\ndistances only in order to get that\nGaultier shirt for half price, the\nFaggy Fourths put on a brave face\nagainst a well prepared and surprisingly good-looking opposition - all\n2 5 0 0 of them. The enthusiasm\nshown at the Royal Festival Hall was\nquickly lost along The Embankment\nas broken cloud became showers.\nWhat started as an eager push at\nThe South Bank became a tired drag\nalong The Mall as spirits seemed to\nhave been broken. It became clear\nthat the quality of the other teams\nmeant we were not going to win. As\nthe rain set in, a diversion for coffee\nat Trafalgar Square guaranteed our\n'Also Ran' position but revived lagging spirits. The half-way water and\nsunshine at Hungerford Bridge\nrevived tired feet and lead to lash-in gs of competitive spirit.\nThe battle for first member of\nThe Fourths to cross the line began.\nClear leaders were Skate Grrrl, Tom\nBoy and Bottle Blonde, with UL U Bod and Butch bringing up the rear.\nA late spurt from Shorty saw her\ncatch up, while Skate Grrrl and Bottle\nBlonde fell back. Butch returned to\nthe back of the pack with UL U Bod.\nShorty and Tom Boy where the first\ntwo from The Fourths across the line\nat Hays Galleria, with UL U Bod and\nButch finishing where they had been\nfor most of the walk - at the back.\nWe decided winning was not\neverything, especially as they had\nmanaged to raise over \u00a3 5 0 0 for\nCrusaid. Man of The Match went to\nShorty for raising the most money.\nEditorial\nMan of the match, A Rajan (66 not out) makes light of praise.\nSports review of the year.\nHullo my beauties.\nSo what great sporting\nachievements have we been getting up to this year? Well, to tell\nyou the truth, I have no idea. This\nis because, I'm afraid to say, that I never bothered to read any of the\narticles, apart from a cursory\nglance to see what sport was\ninvolved. When it became necessary to edit the length of articles 1\ndid so not in any attempt to maintain their narrative structure, but\nrather 1 did it in such a way as to\nmake the page look aesthetically\npleasing. For the most part 1 did\nthis by creating abstract patterns.\nHowever if you have a copy of last\nweek's Felix, hold it at arm's length and stare at it fixedly. After\na few minutes you should be able\nto make out a rudimentary reproduction of Leonardo Da Vinci's Last supper. Jesus' head is a bit\nelongated but other than that it's surprisingly accurate.\n\"But hang on Jake\" you may be\nsaying (if so, please refrain from\nbeing so familiar, it's Mr Thome to\nyou) \"if you couldn't be bothered\nto read any of the articles, why did\nyou become sports editor in the\nfirst place?\" There were two rea-sons. Firstly in order to chronicle\nthe exploits of my beloved Rifle\nand Pistol Club (as you cannot fail\nto have noticed) and secondly to\nfurther my own selfish aims. As an\nexample of the latter reason, I'd just like to say that if anyone out\nthere fancies giving me a job,\nthey're more than welcome. I won't insult your intelligence by\nclaiming to be hard working or\nhonest, but Iam desperate, and\nI 'll take almost anything.\nBut now I must come to the\nend. It is time for me to bid you adieu. A poignant moment indeed. If I were a character from\nNeighbours there would now follow a montage sequence in which\nimportant moments of my life are\nbriefly shown, accompanied by\nsome shockingly tacky piece of\n'pop' music. Sadly I'm not a character from Neighbours, I'm a real\nperson, of sorts, but never mind.\nI'd like to finish by thanking all\nthose who were kind enough to\naid me on my way, particularly my\ncollaborators Niall and David, not\nto mention my friends who were\nkind enough to pop in and help.\nI'd also like to thank all those who contributed articles. May I say that\nfor the most part your articles\nweren't good as such but they\nwere at least lengthy. Jesus Christ\nwere they lengthy.\nGoodbye forever\nJacob.\nP.S. everything I 've ever written\nhas been true.\n\n"

    "content": "24 June 1998 NEWS\nSabbatical Elections Finally Over (Yawn)\nDAVID ROBERTS\nWith just six days to go before the end of term,\nthe Union has at last completed next year's sabbatical line-up, with Chris Ince elected as\nDeputy President (Finance Services) by one of\nthe lowest turnouts in living memory.\nThe election, which took place last\nWednesday and Thursday, was called when the\nprevious DP (F&5) elect, Dave Wharton,\nresigned. Mr Wharton was elected last February,\nalongside Dave Hellard, Adam Cherrington and\nEd Sexton, but stood down when it became\nclear that he would not pass his examinations.\nRather than leave the Union in limbo whilst he\nawaited official confirmation of his results, he\ndecided to open-up the field for new can di dates, to ensure that someone filled this vital\nrole.\nWhen papers for the post came down on 9\nJune, Mr Ince was the only candidate to throw\nhis hat into the ring, and with the result seemingly a foregone conclusion, very little enthusiasm was shown by the electorate. Hustings at\nboth Charing Cross and South Kensington were\ncancelled, and the traditional IC Radio and Felix\ninterviews did not take place. Consequently,\nmost students were unaware that the election\nwas taking place, resulting in a turnout of just\n395 - less than five percent of the registered\nelectorate.\nOn a more positive note, those who did\nturnout returned Mr Ince by one of the most\ncomfortable margins ever recorded. Mr Ince\nbeat New Election (the only other \"candidate\")\nat every polling station apart from Silwood Park,\nregistering 85% of the votes cast and notching\nup a336 to 57 victory.\nThe result was greeted with relief in Union\ncircles. Senior Union figures have been understandably concerned that a New Election result\nwould leave the Union in crisis, forced to survive\nwithout one of its most vital officers until elections could be held in October. Indeed, ICU\nPresident Andy Heeps had described the\nprospect as \"more serious than having to do\nwithout a President\". However, the election of\nChris Ince has been warmly received, with Mr\nInce (a long-term Union stalwart, now in his\nsixth year at Imperial) believed to represent a worthy successor to the current incumbent, Rob\nClark.\nMr Ince was elected on a platform of financial prudence and review, highlighting student\ntraining as one of his principle policies. He\npromised to organise financial training for every\nclub or society treasurer, and thus ensure proper controls at all levels of Union funding. He has\nalso made manifesto commitments to pursue a thorough review of the levels of subsidy offered\nto Union clubs and societies.\nWhilst the election result itself represents\ngood news for the Union, the pitifully low\nturnout is symptomatic of a far wider problem.\nSenior Union figures continue to cite general\ncontentment with the way the Union is run and\nexam pressures as the root cause, but serious\nquestions still remain as to why so few 1C students really seem to care about the organisation\nwhich is supposed to represent them. If mess rs Hellard, Ince and Cherrington wish to claim a true democratic mandate to run the Union, then\ntheir biggest challenge will perhaps be to stop\nthis downward spiral from continuing any\nfurther.\n= Chris Ince\n= New Election\nSTOIC Make Offal\nJON TROUT\nFriday night Channel Four viewers might have\nhad a bit of a fright. For the discerning post-pub\npunter Victor Lewis-Smith's TV Offal has proven\nto be compulsive viewing for the last few weeks;\ngenuine footage from assassinations, honest\nobituaries of unlike able television presenters\nand slick jingles from the original BBC Radio\nOne singers making it an instant favourite.\nAnother feature is the \"Crappy Logo of the\nWeek\", featuring last week ICU's Student\nTelevision of Imperial College. The pictures\nshowed the indeed substandard logo; a revolving cardboard dodecahedron. They went on to\nshow some eternally recognisable Imperial\nunfortunates, a chap with a poodle haircut and\na celebrity interview. It came as quite a shock to\nMike Gibbs, STOIC chair, who only became\naware of it after the broadcast.\nAnonymous Channel 4 researchers had asked to\nlook through the archives a month ago, promising to pay for any footage they used, in the\nregion of over a hundred pounds a second. After\na largely unproductive couple of years, the\nmoney could prove a godsend in providing\nfunds for a non-linear editing suite, which would\nmake production easy even for beginners. One\nPublication Board member said: \"That the frightful design and hopeless taste of late sixties students will ensure the immediate future of the\nstruggling society is sweetly ironic. Hopefully we\ncan use the cash to get a few more people interested in getting STOIC to make television pro-gram mes.\" Mike Gibbs is about 22.\n\n"

    "content": "32\nSMASHING PUMPKINS\nMUSIC 24 June 1998\nAdore ****'/2\nIt's been a long two years since\nthe Pumpkins released their last\nalbum, Mellon Collie and the\nInfinite Sadness, and I have been\nwaiting with bated breath for Adore\nto hit the streets. The 'Pumpkins\nhaven't really been up to much since Mellon Collie, only releasing\nthe mediocre The End is the\nBeginning is the End for the Batman\nsoundtrack. The band was co mission ed to do the complete sound-track, but at the last minute their\nconti but ions were tossed aside\nleaving only the aforementioned\nsingle. Billy Corgan, the lead\nsinger, on the other hand, has been\nfairly busy by himself composing\nfor the Ransom soundtrack, and\nJames lha has released a solo\nalbum of what sounded like light\ncountry music and I advise people\nto steer clear of it.\nAdore is a complete change in\ntack for the sound of the\n'Pumpkins. This has been\nat ti but ed, by many critics, to Billy's mother dying, his marriage breaking up, the dismissal of the band's drummer and the death of their\nkeyboard player from a heroin\noverdose. I personally feel that it is\njust the band exploring another\nfacet of their musical genius. On a recent TV interview the band had\nsaid that they felt that all of their\nwork since the release of Cish, their\nfirst album, had been forced to stay\nin the same vein by their record\nlabel executives. Billy feels that the\nband has an essentially orchestral\ncore and they certainly explored\nthis in the album. Gone is the\nbleeding sore of hate and anger\nthat earmarked most of Mellon\nCollie and certainly all of the second CD, Starlight to Twilight. What\nhas emerged is an album which is\nmuch more mellow, even if it is a bit introspective and gloomy. It has\na rich variety of pianos, strings and\na whole variety of instruments usually associated with the Royal\nAlbert Hall rather than the mental\nmosh pits of ' Pumpkins' gigs.\nWhat they have also made use of\nare drum loops giving some of the\ntracks a distinctly dance-y feel,\nwhich works surprisingly well with\nAppels and Oranjes, the excellent\nAva Adore and the darkly brilliant\nPug being the best examples.\nUnfortunately, in searching for\na new sound or as they put it,\nexposing their core, the band has\nlost some of the magic gained by\nthe use of a hugely distorted guitar\nsound and monumental overdubbing of up to 4 0 separate recordings of slightly different guitar riffs\non the same track. Despite this,\nthe album is amazing if not quite\nup to the standard of Siamese\nDream and Mellon Collie and you don't have to listen to any of James\nlha's songs either, which is a bonus. I thoroughly recommend\nthis album to anyone who is\nalready a 'Pumpkins fan, or who just likes a bit of something slightly\nheavier than awful commercial rock. Just as something to push\nthe frontiers of music a seventeen\nsecond track is included, imaginatively titled 17, at the end of the\nalbum. Billy and the band give the\nexecs, the birdie. EI\nSimon\n'Pumpkins in the house! Well, just\noutside, actually.\nSLAYER\nDiabolus in Musica \u2022\nSometime, somewhere in my\npast, 1 drank bottles of 20-20, got pissed off at anything\nand anyone and always, without\nfail, believed that I was right about\neverything. 1 also listened to\nAnthrax, Megadeth and Slayer.\nNow, I'm quite partial to a pint of\nCaffrey's, get pissed of at slightly\nless stuff and always, without fail,\nbelieve that I'm right about every-thing. Ido not, however, listen to\nthe aforementioned bands any-more. Possession of an acoustic\nguitar has thrown me into more of\na Bob Dylan/Embrace/ Bernard\nButler category. May beI'm wrong.\nMaybe1 should have never\nchanged the way 1 listen. Perhaps\nthis Slayer album will pull me back\ninto the clutches of heavy/\nthrash/speed/death or whatever\ntype of metal Slayer fall into now a days. Something tells me though\nthat this is unlikely to happen.\nListening to the screaming,\nshouting and seven thousand notes\na second soloing, I could feel my\nsenses dulling while my creative\nthoughts scrambled for the exit\nMELYS\nRumours and Curses \u2022\u2022\u2022i/2 sign in my head. 1 must admit\nRichard and Judy were on the telly\nbut the sound was turned down so\ntheir effect was minimal. No, it was\ndefinitely the monotonic nature of\nSlayer that was responsible for my\nmind being numbed. Song titles\nlike Stain of Mind, Death's Head,\nScreaming From the Sky, In The\nName of Cod and Perversions of\nPain are all good indications of the\nsort of sound you're likely to let\nyour eardrums be battered with.\nTo get a balanced opinion, 1\ndecided to ask some friends,\nacquaintances and strangers what\nthey thought of the Slayer sound.\nWhat follows is a collection of their\nresponses: fuckin' terrible, horrible,\nthe masters, grotesque, disgusting,\nfuckin' gods, 1 feel sick, fantastic\nand head-split tingly splendid. Slayer seem to have a knack of\npola rising camps so it really is your\ndecision to make. I made mine\nearly on in the album but gave\nthem one star for old times'\nsake. EJ\nDennis\nM elys are a new four piece\nband from Wales, who have been signed to the\nsame label as Gorky's Zygotic\nMy nci. They mix simple melodies\nwith gentle St Ettiene style synth\nbeats and borrow some experimental keyboard work from\nStereolab to create a unique mellow electro-folk sound. The music\nis built around the delicate voice of\nAngela Parker, whose angelic\nvocals conceal dark and often disturbing lyrics. '1 want to kill him,\ngouge out his eyes, write my name\nacross his face, with Stanley\nknife...' is just part of the seething\nplan of revenge outlined in Acid\nQueen. Accompaniment is provided by synthesisers, guitar, and a multitude of strange electronic\neffects, which are fused into simple rhythms and melodies that perfectly complement the fragile\nvocals.\nIt is unfortunate that M elys do not really fit in with the current\nmusical fashions and will probably\nnot get much airplay, as the tracks\non the album are of a very high\nstandard. Diwifir, a haunting\nmelody sung in a mixture of Welsh\nand English, is a track that will get\nstuck in your head for days, while\nLemming combines sleigh-bells\nand electro-twangs with wonderfully psychotic lyrics. My favourite\ntracks on the album have to be the\nbeautiful acoustic When You Put\nLeonard Cohen On telling the sad\ntale of a couple drifting apart and\nthe final track Matryoshka which\nadds the Llanrwst Male Voice Choir\nto a vast electronic ocean of swish-es, buzzing, echoes and distortion.\nRumours and Curses is a promising\ndebut album and I would recommend it to anyone disillusioned\nwith the same old guitar bands.\nBuy it now and be,smug when they\nappear on Jools Holland.El\nPhil\n\n"

It is\nplanned to have services restored by 09.00 on Monday July 13th. Given the very complex and integrated nature of the College computing and network facilities it is highly likely that if you do come into\nCollege that weekend you will only be able to use your computer system to run its own local applications.\nThere will be NO ACCESS to any CCS or external computing/network\nservices from on campus nor to any College computing/network services\nfrom off campus. Examples of services affected are:\nAccess to the wide area network via Super-Janet\nCentral servers e.g. FTP server, Tex font server, Exchange/Outlook Mail\nDepartmental clusters that authorise against the IC domain\nE mail servers e.g. Charing X, Brompton, Administration, Library\nNetworked services e.g. dial-up services, DNS, the Mail relays\nWeb servers e.g. College, Library, Student union, School of Medicine\nAdministration services e.g. MISE, Administration Web\nLibrary services e.g. Libertas, ERL server, CD Rom server, public PCs\nThis loss of service is occurring because the entire power supply to the\nMechanical Engineering Building, which houses the CCS, will be\nswitched off for electrical safety checking at the request of the College's Estates Division. Given the problems caused by switching off the electrical supply for maintenance work, only limited maintenance has been\ncompleted since 1984.

A year ago, Imperial College\nwas a place where students' interests were not represented on the\nkey planning and development\ncommittees; it was a place where\nstudents could flounder, fail and\neven disappear without any reaction or apparent concern from their\ndepartment; and it was a disparate\nand uninterested community\nwhere the union existed in name\nbut not in spirit.\nNow, the situation is exactly\nthe same. This is my fault. Not\nbecause I am responsible, but\nbecause it was my aim to change\nthese things, and instead I spent\nmy time gluing things together,\nswearing at salesmen, completing\npetty cash claims and emptying the\ndustbin. In short, I was far to busy\nrunning a newspaper to actually\nuse it for anything.\nOf all the things I have consistently failed to do over the last\nyear, one of the omissions that has\nsurprised me most is my total failure to have any more idea about\nhow Imperial College actually\nworks than I did when I still\nthought that Friday nights down\nthe union were pretty neat back in\nthe first year.\nI expected to understand the\nmachinations of the admin is tra tion; I imagined being able to\nswagger about Suite Five greeting\npro-rectors by their first name and\nslapping the college secretary on\nthe back and asking him about his\nfamily; I thought that if there was\nanybody who would know what\nwas happening before it happened,\nit would be me.\nI can come up with plenty of\nperfectly good reasons why this\ndidn't happen, not least that I already had seventy hours a week\nof less important things to deal\nwith, and almost go sued at the\nbeginning of the year. The real reason has nothing to do with this.\nThe real reason why 1 never found\nout what was going on, why lan\nCaldwell doesn't even recognise\nme and why I never met the rector\nis that I didn't actually, all things\nconsidered, want to.\nFor all my high-minded ideas\nand idealistic editorials, the truth is\nthat I'm really not interested. 1\ndon't really care.

    "content": "24 June 1998 MUSIC 29\nWELCOME TO THE HUMAN EMBRACE\nArrogant, brilliant, over-rated, best debut since The Stone Roses, a cynical attempt to occupy the middle ground created by Oasis and The Verve.\nEmbrace's album has caused quite a stir amongst fans of music. We let Dennis and Ed tell us what they think....\nEMBRACE\nThe Good Will Out\nC aught in a wave of premature adulation, Embrace\nlook to be set up for quite a confrontation with the most fickle\nof corporations known to man:\nYou, the British public. With all the\nsurrounding hype, Embrace will\nstand or fall on their debut, which\nhas already drawn comparison with\nThe Stone Roses and Definitely\nMaybe. This may come across as a bit harsh on their career should\nthey fall short of the mark but it's the McNamara s and Co. that have\nengineered this coming together.\nDanny's already admitted that he\nboasted before recording the\nalbum that it was going to be fantastically good in order to push\nhimself to make sure that it was.\nAnd it is.\nTruly, it is. You're greeted with\nforty-odd seconds of orchestral\ntuning, gradually rising in volume.\nThere's some indistinguishable\nchatter, a rattle of kettle drums and\nthe now familiar All You Good Good\nPeople bursts its way out of the\nspeakers and into your ears. It's here where a lot of people will have\nto start making decisions about\nhow they feel while Danny adds\nsome persuasive advice, 'Lose all\nyour fears. They're keeping you down. You won't have to fake it\nwhile I'm around. All you good good people, listen to me.' Did\nsomebody say epic? There must\nhave been a 'Big Chorus' switch in\nthe recording studio that's been\nwedged down with copies of various music press publications. My\nWeakness Is None Of Your\nBusiness, Come Back To What You\nKnow and One Big Family. They all\nresonate with an the mic grandeur.\nIt's all a bit personal, as well.\nLyrically, you can spot their ideas\nand beliefs very quickly. The line,\n\"The good will come out,\" features\nin three different songs. \"Don't wanna let you down,\"( My\nWeakness Is...) and \"I 'll never let\nyou down,\"( Come Back To... and\nFireworks) demonstrate their commitment to not disappointing pe o ple. As well as the vulnerable side,\nthere's also the constant reminder\nthat we're here to make the most\nand best of things: 'If you're alive,\nthen why aren't you living?' (1 Want\nThe World), 'The view's too good to jump. Now let me talk you\ndown.'( You've Got To Say Yes) and\nthe triumphant, 'It's the way I feel!'\n(The Last Cas)\nThe Good Will Out is a touching album crammed with at least\nseven or eight pure gems of which\nRetread, Higher Sights and That's All Changed Forever are probably\nthe best. The only lulls on the emotional plane come ironically in the\nmore hedonistic numbers. It's not\n'Group hug, anyone?'\nthat they can't pull them off, it's just that other bands that begin\nwith the letter O would probably be\nable to be more fierce about it.\nHowever, this is splitting hairs. This\nis a shamelessly optimistic album\nthat is both musically grand and\nlyrically beautiful. Journalists, cast\naside your cool attitudes. Cynics,\nopen your hearts. Fellow people,\nopen your ears. Embrace Embrace\nand rejoice! EJ\nDennis\nLOST IN MUSICAL DISGRACE\nEMBRACE\nThe Gods Will Shout No Stars\nA few points before I listen to\nthe album. Apparently, 1997\nwas a great year for British\nmusic. The Verve and Radiohead\nfinally hit the big time, The Prodigy\nand Oasis went supernova and\nRadio 1 told us about exciting new\nbands such as Man sun, Hurricane\n#1 but mostly Embrace. Over 12\nmonths ago Steve Lamacq called\nthem \"The greatest find of the\nyear.\" I assumed he must have\nbeen taking the piss when he\nplayed a demo of All You Good\nGood People, for what followed\nwas a load of distorted guitars\nunderneath a tone deaf singer with\na cold. When it emerged that Mr. Evening Session was being sincere,\ncomments of the 'I could sing better than that' variety could be heard\nemanating from my mouth. So\nbegan my ill-fated relationship with\nEmbrace, it seems strange that so\nmany people are not only convinced that Danny McNamara isn't tone deaf but is actually a fantastic\nsinger. He claims that, 'I could sing\nlike Gary Barlow if 1 wanted to' (by\nwhich he means in tune) opting\ninstead for a voice that, you know,\nmeans it. Listen, Danny, thousands\nof people 'mean it' when they sing\nin Karaoke bars, but it counts for\nnothing if you can't hit the notes.\nThe album cover shows Embrace in\ntypical self-loving fashion: their\nhigh-held heads shadowed as they\nhold back the force of the sunshine.\nI mean, God's gotta come from\nsomewhere, so why not\nHuddersfield? Anyway, on to the\nmusic.\nEmbrace reworked All You\nGood Good People last Christmas\nwith overblown orchestral\nenhancements. In clich ed style, the\nsong starts softly and gradually\nbuilds to a climax near the end,\nthen finishing all quiet and sub-due d. It received a totally undeserved Top 10 hit. And why mess\nwith a winning formula? Recent single Come Back To What You Know\nfollows exactly the same path (the\nvocals are a bit better: he's still\ntone deaf but at least his cold has\ngone) as, in fact, does the whole of\ntheir new album. Debut albums are\nfirst attempts to show the world\nwhat you're about. They shouldn't take 15 months to record (lack of\nideas, lads?) and should show at\nleast a bit of variety. The problem is\nthat every song is either a near carbon copy of AYGCP (re-worked\nagain for the album; still rubbish)\nor, like One Big Family, a bit more\nshout y. Hearing one Embrace song\nis bad enough, but being subjected\nto a monotonous album-full is\npainful. Embrace's grandiose style\nhas gained them comparisons to\nOasis, but in truth they share more\nwith Shed Seven (both musically\nand vocally). When Embrace are\ncalled upon to produce a follow-up\nalbum, the world will finally realise\nhow pathetic the group are - a pub\nband trying to take on the world.\nTheir songs lack any true feeling; a fault that they have tried to make\nup for by dropping syrupy strings\neverywhere. But strings are no substitute for emotion. Save your\nmoney people and listen to some\ndebuts that you already know are\nof established quality. 0\nEd\n\n"

The Alexandra Palace was\na wonderful venue, the food outstanding and the entertainment\nsuperb. Minor gripes, though, as all\ngood letters must have. The bus\ncompany, who promised to send\nsixteen buses, provided only eight.\nThis made transport more than a little trying. My main reason for\nwriting though, was the appa ling behaviour of our outgoing\nPresident, Mr Andrew Heeps. After\na competent and largely successful\nyear in office, and a pleasing post\nafter-dinner speech thanking the\norganisers, Mr Heeps' conduct\ngrew steadily worse. Leching over\nthe outgoing ICSM President (Miss\nKatie Armstrong) for the majority of\nthe night, his amorous attentions\nturned to his male company, and\nhe was seen with his tongue down\nthe throat of, amongst others, both\nDeputy Presidents, a ULU\nSabbatical, the Publication Board\nchair, the Council Chair and unfortunately, this unfortunate corre-sponde nt. He sang coarse songs\nand danced solo for the entire\nreturn coach journey, and was\ndescribed by one friend as being\n\"utterly, utterly, utterly fucked. The\nman could not have been any more\ndrunk.\" Is this the proper behaviour\nof an ambassador for our Union?\nOr the sad demise which many\nthought would accompany the\ngradual move back to the rig ours of\nmedical studies? 1 think that we\nshould be told. Good luck Andy:\nRemember; I have the negatives,\nlet's talk business.\nEver yours,\nJonathan Trout, Features Editor\n1997-8\nMINIMUM WAGE\nRIP-OFF\nDear Felix,\nLast week's announcement by\nMargaret Beckett that the minimum wage will be \u00a33.60 for most\nworkers but only \u00a33.00 for those\nbetween 18 and 21 is another kick\nin the balls for us youths'.\nDue to be 'phased in' between\nnext April and June 2000, this proposal will affect some vulnerable\ngroups e.g. students, those trying\nto hold down a starting job or even\nraise a young family (those on the\nNew Deal will get something different again). So which of these is\nonly worth \u00a33.00 an hour? Even the\nUnion's basic rate is \u00a33.65 and\nthat's not taxed.\nYoung people have always been\nexploited (re: the child labour\nuproars) but to institutional is e this\nsituation is criminal. It sounds like\nMrs Beckett will shortly be getting\nher come-up pan ce but like most\nbig organised crime the bosses will\nprobably continue to live unchallenged in numbers 10 and 11.\nYours, Antoine Jeanson\nDIVINE\nENGINEERING\nSir\nThe last few weeks have seen\nthe Genetic Engineering debate\nincrease in pace, thanks largely to\nsome unhelpful comments by HRH\nPrince Charles. Denouncing the\nscience of genetics as playing God\nis hardly accurate and, in my mind,\nan insult to monotheistic religions.\nDoes the Prince think medical\nintervention at car accidents is also\na little too divine? Or, like much of\nthe population, is he simply dismissing something as evil because\nhe fails to understand it? Genetic\nEngineering, like all new techno lo gies, has the potential to be mis-used. It also holds the possibility\nof reducing disease and hunger\nthroughout the world, something I hope the Prince would applaud,\nyours as a biologist,\nEd Sexton, Felix Editor Elect\nHair saloN\n15a Harrington Road\nSouth Kensington London SW7 3ES(1 Minute walk from South Kensington Tube)\nC UT&c BLOW DRY BY OUR TOP STYLISTS\n\u00a315 LADIES\n\u00a313 MEN Normal Price \u00a330\nu3 Telephone 0171 823 8968 j ACCESS VISA MASTERCARD CASH CHi QU tS "
