    "content": "CLETTERS;\nOUR\nCity and\nGuilds\nCentenary\nWeek\nFrom the Dean, City and Guilds College\nDear Sir,\nIn February 1885, six full-time students of\nthe Central Institutions, forerunner of the\nCity and Guilds College, started courses in a new, purpose-built building in Exhibition\nRoad. The Central Institution, for university-level education in engineering, was\nestablished by an initiative of the Livery\nCompanies (The Guilds) of the City of\nLondon, through the City and Guilds of\nLondon Institute\u2014whose connection with\nthe College is still maintained, despite the\namalgamation of the City and Guilds College\n(as it then became) with RCS and RSM in\n1907 to form the Imperial College of Science\nand Technology.\nReviewing the century's activities of the\nCollege and its old students, it became clear\nthat a remarkable number of major\nfundamental contributions with far-reaching\neffects on technology, and very many large-scale projects the world over, have flowed\nfrom the City and Guilds College and its\nstudents: hence the idea of a centenary\ncelebration. A Steering Committee was set\nup, which co-opted the City and Guilds\nCollege Union President to its number.\nThree main functions have been planned: a Banquet (Feb 26) in the Guildhall, an all-day\n(Feb 27) Symposium on '21st Technology' (a forward look at technological trends,\nopportunities and challenges) and an\nExhibition 'Technology\u20142000', a selection of\nforward-looking research in the City and\nGuilds College.\nIn addition to the 75 sub sidi sed Banquet\ntickets for students already allocated through\nthe C&G Union, a further 25 tickets (carrying\na lower subsidy) will be available through the\nUnion Office. Free places for students at the\nSymposium are available, but you must\nregister in advance; name-badges giving entry\nwill be issued (only to those on the list of\nregi strands) at a desk at the entrance to the\nGreat Hall on the day of the Symposium\n(registration through Departmental Offices,\nas already notified by Heads of Department).\nStudents of Imperial College, and visitors,\nwill have free entry to the 'Tech 2000'\nExhibition between 10.00am and 4.00pm on\nthe Thursday (28/2/85) and the Friday\n(1/3/85).\nThe Symposium will comprise\npresentations, and discussion by\nparticipants, on Advanced Manufacturing\nTechnology, Civil Engineering, Information\nTechnology and the Process Industries in the\n21st Century, and on their socio-economic\nimplications and challenges. It will of ter students an unusual opportunity to attend\ndiscussions between senior academics,\nindustrialists and decision-makers, on\nmatters of great importance.\nThe Centenary offers us the chance to\nproject the College to schools, so we are\nplanning two Open Days (28/2/85 and\n1/3/85). Visitors can see Tech-2000 and\nsomething of the different Guilds\nDepartments; considerable effort has been\ninvested in preparations.\nWe need College guides to direct parties\nbetween departments and to stay with their\nparties throughout the visit. If you are not\nalready committed to Departmental\nActivities on the Open Day, would you please\nconsider if you can help as a College Guide; if\nso, please contact the C&G Union Office\nnow, where details are available. The\nSteering Committee will not let any help go\nun rewarded, but primarily, this is a valuable\nopportunity to influence the next generation\nof students who will follow you\u2014and the\nCollege needs your help.\nYours sincerely\nProfessor Bruce McA Sayers\nWho dares\nwins\nTo Mr Grenville Manuel\nDear Grenville,\nMay I first of all thank you for your\nconcern at the current plight faced, regarding\nUnion finances, and your most helpful\nsuggestions as to an opportunity to ease the\nburden.\nIt appears quite obvious to me that you, as\na man of many means, are well versed in this\nsomewhat specialised field of 'Newspaper\nBingo'. Now, I have no wish to impose upon\nyour precious time, but if at all possible, I would relish the opportunity of discussion g with you, in not inconsiderable detail, the 'ins\nand outs' of the Daily Mirror 'Who Dares\nWins'. I would hate to miss an opportunity of\nwinning the competition, on behalf of the\nUnion, through not being in full command of\nall available information, as I'm sure you are.\nI look forward to your briefing.\nYours, completely in awe,\nIan Bull\nPresident\nmore letters on page 4\nFELIX\nThe unrest among the City and Guilds\nstudents over the Centenary affair is no\nmystery.\nDue to an official blunder, the College\nannounced that all C&G lectures would be\ncancelled for three days in Centenary Week.\nWhat was not generally announced was the\nfact that at least some of the students would\nbe expected to act as guides to visiting school\nchildren.\nNaturally the students were overjoyed at\nthe prospect of this 'holiday'. Some made\nimmediate travel arrangements; many more,\nI suspect, earmarked the three days for\ncatching up on coursework, and revising for\nexaminations.\nAt any rate, it was assumed that these three\ndays off meant just that\u2014three days off. It\nwas simply not made clear to students that\nthey were expected to remain on campus.\nBut the reason is not difficult to find. The\nCentenary has been organised by\ncommittees. And, to my knowledge, some\nmembers of these committees have worked\nextremely hard to make the Centenary Week\na success. But what has been lacking has been\nleadership. There has been no apparent\nfigurehead for the Centenary organisation,\nno one to rally the troops, no one to inspire,\nno one to take a firm hand.\nWho better to do so than the elected Dean\nof the City and Guilds College, who, if he\nmakes a stand even at this eleventh hour, may\nstill be able to instil some enthusiasm for an\nevent that otherwise, from a student point of\nview, will be the flop of the century.\nOne calls to mind the words of Tennyson:\n\"It profits little that an idle king,\nBy this still hearth, among these barren\ncrags,\nMatch'd with an aged wife, I mete and dole\nUnequal laws unto a savage race,\nThat hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know\nnot me.\"\nAcknowledgements: Many thanks to Ajay,\nGren, Dave, Hugh, Nigel, Pete, Finian,\nTinker, Absorbance, Martin, Pete, Sean,\nLuke, Jon, John, Ian, Dave, Sean, Rosemary\nand Tony.

    "content": "LFEATURE\nA Day in the Life Of Yes, it's part two of the Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Sabbaticals, FELIX'S expose of what you have to do to get a free room in hall. If last week's article made you think that being a sabbatical wasn't as easy as you\nthought then maybe this week's will put you off completely and hopefully\nmake you so grateful for the work that they do on your behalf that you'll\nbuy them all a drink.\nDave Parry\u2014DP\nI get up about 9.30. The first job when\nI get in is to tidy my desk, clearing off\nyesterday's mess. The DP is\nresponsible for the Union rooms as\nwell as the money, so one of the tasks\nof the morning is to check that noone has burnt the J CR down, or\nbroken into one of the pinball\nmachines. Phone calls tend to take\nup a lot of time. I seem to get phone\ncalls on almost everything, and some\npeople seem to think of me as\nDirectory Enquiries. The rest of the\nmorning is spent on the most\npressing business of the moment,\nsay something that someone raised\nwith me in the bar the previous night.\nLunch is taken in the Union snack\nbar at about 11.30, leaving plenty of\ntime before the midday rush, when\nthe Union Office fills with enormous\nquantities of people all attempting to\nbuttonhole me. There could be a lunchtime committee meeting, so\nthere's no chance of an early\nafternoon snooze. Afternoon could\nmean a college meeting, or I could\nspend it on a long term project, such\nas the refurbishment of the Union\nBuilding.\nThere could be a Major Sub Committee in the evening, or I could\ntry and goto see a film. Because I'm a duty officer I have to make sure that\nthere aren't any fights in the bar, and\nthat no-one fills The Lounge ankle\ndeep in vomit. I am on Refectory\nCommittee, so I am forced to\nundertake regular quality checks on\nthe beer that the bars serve.\nUnfortunately many people seem\nunable to differentiate my serious\nquality control with getting drunk\njust for the hell of it. I never see bed\nvery early. Hassle for the building\nmeans hassle for me. For instance,\nwhen Guilds didn't clear up after\nCarnival it was me who didn't get to\nsleep until 3-o clock the following\nafternoon. Monster.\nThere's a lot of responsibility for\nthe DP. The job is not quite what I expected\u2014there's a lot more work\nfor a start. You have to be impartial\nwhen it comes to making decisions\nabout different parts of the Union,\nand know a lot about how the Union\nworks. You have to know how people\nwork too, and keep your act together\neven when things go wrong and you\nstart running round like a headless\nchicken.\nI think that anyone who thinks they\nwould like to stand for DP next year\nreally ought to talk to me. It would be\na pity to have to put up with the\nhassle of being DPifyoudidnoenjoy\nit.\nDave Rowe\u2014FELIX\nMy work definitely runs on a weekly\ncycle. On Mondays to Thursdays I get in at 9-o clock, and spend about\nan hour deciding on which jobs are\nto be printed that day, trying to get\nthe best out of the limited printing\nfacilities. After that there is the\ndonkey work of producing a weekly\nnewspaper, such as pasting up, dot\nscreening, or proof-reading. On\nFridays however I have to be up at 7-o clock to distribute FELIX around\ncollege, and most of my morning is\nfilled with fending off complaints\nfrom over-zealous Publicity Officers\nthat their diary entry is wrong, or that their article has been cut.\nLunchtimes can be bedlam, as the\nFELIX office becomes populated\nwith people bringing articles or small ads, with the occassional staff\nmember storming into the office and\nscreaming 'Hold the front page'.\nOnce the chaos subsides I can\ncontinue with the grind of producing\nFELIX. There's the constant pressure\nof the deadline. I work weekends and\nlate in the evening, possibly very late\non a Wednesday, putting the paper\ntogether. Thursday night means\ncollation, a quiet drink with the hard-working colla tors, and the satisfaction of another issue complete.\nUnlike the other sabbaticals who\nmight be working on long term\nprojects I can always point to\nsomething I 've actually produced at\nthe end of a week. Howeverthe paper\noften owes more to the staff'than to\nthe editor. That's why it is very\nimportant for the editor to attract\nnew staff and get the best out of\nthem, while remembering that\nthey're studying at the same time.\nThere is more work than I thought\nthere would be, but on the other hand\nit is more rewarding. I often overhear\npeople talking about FELIX, and I get\nfeedback all the time. I don't mind too\nmuch if people don't like it, it's more\nof a failure if people don't care.\nA FELIX editor must be te chic ally competent\u2014he or she must be able\nto work all the various bits of\nequipment and there isn't the time to\nlearn when you are editing the paper.\nFor that reason I think it would be\nunwise for anyone who had never\nworked on FELIX to stand as editor.\nApart from that DO IT\u2014it's the job of\na lifetime.\nFriday 15 February 1985 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "fake a Walk \u00a9o wi} This is the first in a series of articles trying to raise Joe Student's awareness of the\nthings going on within 100 yards of IC. There are students who leave the College\nwithout even going into the Science Museum, never mind some of the less well\nknown parts of South Kensington. People travel thousands of miles to visit these\nplaces\u2014we only have to travel a few yards!\nThe British Library National\nSound Archive\nNEWS FEATURED\nEXHIBITION\nROAD SWT\nCITY OF WESTMINSTER\nThe British Library National\nSound Archive is the UK's largest public reference of sound\nrecordings. It holds over 500,000\ndiscs and enough tape to run for\ntwo and a half years, as well as\nthousands of discographies and\nbooks on sound recordings. If\nyou want to look at a copy of the\nRadio Times from 1948 or hear\nthe mating call of an OrangUtang then the BLNSA is on\nyour doorstep. As it's name\nsuggests the BLNSA is a part of\nthe British Library, and it\nemploys 40 staff in it's imposing\npremises at 29 Exhibition Road,\nalthough it is expanding by\ntaking on additional property in\nPrinces Gardens. It started life as\na collection of classical music\nrecordings, but has now\nbroadened it's coverage to all\nforms of sound recording. It\nholds the world's second largest\ncollection of wildlife sounds, as\nwell as collections of jazz, pop,\nopera, ethnic and voice\nrecordings. The recordings are\non every medium conceivable,\nfrom wax cylinders and Pianola\nrolls to digitally recorded\ncompact disks, including some\nthat never became popular such\nas paper tape, metal wire and\ndiscs spinning at 16 rpm.\nAlthough the library does not\nha-ve lending facilities their\ncollection is undoubtedly a national asset, and more to the\npoint it is right next to Imperial\nCollege and the facilities are\nthere to be used. The library\noffers a free listening service,\nwith introductory tapes giving\ndetails of some of the many\nservices it offers. Recordings can\nbe heard in a special listening\nroom. A particularly interesting\nearly recording is that made by WE Gladstone the Victorian Prime\nMinister in 1889, although the\nrecordings are by no means\npurely historical. Copies of over\n60% of the discs issued in the UK\nare deposited in the archives, and\nthe library tapes extensively from\nthe BBC under a special licence.\nAll the subject curators are\nexperts in their field, so the\nlibrary can offer an Information\nService, helping to track down\nrecordings, and it is installing a new computer system to help in\nthis task. If someone feels that\na particular recording of theirs\nhas a particular historical value\nthen they may submit it for\ninclusion in the libraries archive.\nThere are superb facilities for\nlooking after recordings, and\nstate-of-the-art equipment is\nused extensively. Visitors are\noften surprised to see the\ntechnology that has to be used to\nsqueeze the last ounce of sound\nout of an old recording. For\ninstance a custom built cylinder\nplayer using silicon chips\nreplaces a device that originally\nwould have run by clockwork\nand had a mahogany case.\nWhen it takes on it's new\npremises in Princes Gate the\nlibrary intends to mount a permanent audio-visual\nexhibition. Among the exhibits\nwill be a phonogram owned by\nGeorge Bernard Shaw. So if you\nwant to hear a particularly rare\nCharlie Parker 78 or just perfect\nyour Geordie accent so you can\ndo impersonations of your\nTyneside friends then visiting the\nBLNSA means just taking a short\nwalk down Exhibition Road.\nmo oi a, A gSc t L1H< fAR0 VcuA \\rAi#-r.\"f \u00ab\u00ab*y( k>73 Cw/b'AKr M O(Oo A/ v7l\"\\/ \u00a3 J of\nO(!

    "content": "^REVIEWED\nSINGLES\nKim Carnes\nI confess to only really\nknowing one Kim Carnes\nsong, Bette Davis Eyes.\nInvitation to Dance is nothing\nlike that so I 'll have to\ncomment as if I'd never heard\nof Miss Carnes. This could be\na really good single\u2014soulful\nfunk if rather 70's disco\nstyle \u2014 unfortunately the chorus of 15 Invitation to\nDance's would put anyone off.\nDavid Bowie: This Is Not\nAmerica\nI find it very difficult to take\nthis seriously. After seeing his\npuppet on Spitting Images\nlast Sunday, I keep imagining\nBowie in the back of a taxi with\nswivelling eyes. I don't actually believe this could be\ndescribed as in any way a classic Bowie track though\n\u2014the man has a great voice\nbut not on bland songs like\nthis.\nPlay Dead: Sacrosanct\nThis will be the first time\nyou'll have heard of this\nOxford Band and probably\nwill be the last, certainly if they\ncarry on producing rubbish\nlike this. It's like a male version\nof Toyah, without a tune.\nHorrible.\nMusical Choirs: Australia\nSomeone handed me this\nPostman Pat EP in a party a couple of weeks back, and I promised to spin it on my\nradio show. When I listened to\nit however, I was sure it\ndeserved the full review\ntreatment. Musical Chairs are\na college band and from the\nsound of the production,\nrecorded this in someone's back room. Although overblown mikes can be\nannoying this doesn't really\ndetract form a great sound.\nThe best way Lean describe\nit is as a quieter version of J Gejls Band plus synths. It's dead good.\nDANCE\nJanet\nSmith\nIt is important to remember\nthat ballet( especially contemporary dance) is not\npurely there for its 'meaning'\nbut is (as with many art forms)\nthere for the pleasure or\nsensations it gives you. It is a very effective way of\nconveying an atmosphere or\nfeeling rather than a meaning,\nstatement or thought. It is not\npre ten sio us then.\n'Janet Smith and dancers' is\na small touring dance group\nand is made up of individuals\nwho, although may not dance\nso ry th mic ally and well in a group, dance well as solo\nperformers. Personally, I don't enjoy plain ballet, but with\nmore interesting music, sets\nand themes I find con temporary ballet can be very\nenjoyable and thrilling. Almost ecstatic when seen\nlive.\nA small group like this\nwould not work as 'Rites of\nSpring' but can perform very\ngood smaller dances. 'Another man Drowning' is a pensive dance, inspired by LS Lowry'spain tng, with colours\nand sets re mini cent of that\nlife. The appropriately clothed\ndancers living out a 'humdrum' existance to a mixture of rhythmic sound\neffects, music and nonsense\nverse. Ending, as the central\ncharacters's life just falls\napart, with a vision of the sea\nthat actually made me feel I was there. That deserted\nbeach seemed very real.\nOther dancers are more\nenjoyable and even funny.\nSome of the dances have\nchoreographed their own\npieces and they are inter-e sting, the mei c and show\npromise (although I am hardly\nan expert to comment).\nThe dancers will be\npresenting two programs of\ndance at 'The Place' theatre\nEuston, from1923 of\nFebruary and they are worth\nseeing.\nOnce again the HG Wells Society of Imperial College is proud to present the lecture-demonstration of HYPNOSIS by Martin S Taylor\nFELIX\nMonday February 18 from 7.30 till 10.30 in Room 220, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Imperial College, Exhibition Road, SW7.

    "content": "TLFTTRRS\nGuilds not\nclosed shop\nDear Sir,\nWe would like to reply to some of the\ncriticisms of the City and Guilds Union\nhandling of the Centenary made by Mr\nDrummond-Smith in his letter last week\n(FELIX 695).\nFirst, the Centenary is being celebrated\nover a period of a whole week, the three days\nduring which classes will be cancelled are to\nenable students to participate fully in the\ncelebrations, to regard this as a holiday is a gross abuse of a privilege.\nSecondly, in selling our limited allocation\nof sub sidi sed tickets for the Banquet, we took\nevery possible measure to ensure that every\nGuilds student would have an equal chance\nof getting a ticket.\nThirdly, after some disagreement, it was\ndecided to let IC Ents organise a Centenary\nCarnival, because they insisted on having\ncontrol over it.\nFinally, it is very disappointing that P Drummond-Smith, as a Guilds student, is\nabusing the opportunity to celebrate the\nCollege's Centenary, especially considering\nthe amount of time and effort which both\nCollege staff and the Union have put into\norganising the events. Mr Drummond-Smith\nis offering to organise trips to cater for that\nexclusive group of students who can afford\nmid-season skiing\u2014and yet he accuses us of\nbeing a closed shop.\nYours,\nSimon Chamberlain, Hon Sec\nLuke Walker, A AO\nSarah Cox, Publicity Officer\nAnne Driver, Publicity Officer\nAdrian Johnson, Reprographics Officer\nPisshead\nclique\nDear Sir,\nSo the Guilds Dean and academics are\nshocked students don't want to work for\nnothing at the Guilds Centenary? Virtually\nno students have volunteered to help out:\ndon't they care about City and Guilds? Well,\nI can answer that simply\u2014no, we don't really\ncare that much.\nMaybe, when we first came to IC, we had\nhigh ideas about THE Imperial College and\nCity and Guilds College, but we soon learn to\nlose them. Mention C&G to most\nengineering students and the first thing that\ncomes to mind is the self-interested piss head clique in the Union (harmless in themselves,\nbut not the sort of group we'd like to be\ninvolved with), and then secondly the\nisolated academics of our departments who\nseem to care far less for student then for their\npet 'Body Scanner' projects.\n\u2022Let's look at the facts. For the average\nengineering student, none of the events held\nduring the Centenary are of the slightest\ninterest\u2014at least if any were,\"they are\noverpriced and booked out by hacks. We get\nincredibly pissed off by the seemingly\nbottomless pit of money to be spent on\nCentenary projects such as redecorating the\nJCR and repainting the railings outside Elec\nEng, when money is not available for work\ninside our own departments.\nNow there's a point\u2014why don't students\nrespect their academic Guilds College. Well,\nwhat are some of the major academic\nproblems over the past few years for\nengineering students?\nFirst, the four year courses produce the\nkind of graduate IC thinks industry should\nwant instead of the kind industry needs.\nSecondly, maths continues to be taught by\nmathematicians to engineers, mathematicians who neither know, nor care, how to get\nacross new ideas to non-mathematicians.\nThirdly, departments seem to resent the\nidea that any courses are either badly taught,\nor that they are not necessary (or even\ndesirable) to the degree.\nThese problems have been presented time\nand time again to those academics who now\nhave endless energy, time and money to put\ninto what to students here and now is a useless publicity exercise. Perhaps when they\nstart taking notice of the real students who\nreally work here, instead of clever clever ideas\nadministration may formulate, perhaps then\nwe will return the respect by feeling a commitment to C&G. Name wit held by request\nPS Isn't it interesting that all around Guilds,\nequipment is being brought out to impress\noutsiders, that students have never, and\nprobably will never see\u2014-toys for those\nacademics?\nLetters\npray\nDear Sir,\nA Thanksgiving Service is being organised to\nmark the 28th Anniversary of the\nIndependence of Ghana on March 3 1985 at\nthe American Church, near Goodge Street\nUnderground Station.\nWhen we meet, we shall thank God for all\nthat our country has been blessed with, and\ncommit the present and the future into His\nfatherly hands. We shall remember other\nparts of Africa, Britain and the world at large\nin our prayers.\nYou are cordially invited.\nMay the peace of the Lord Jesus be with\nyou.\nYours in His service,\nRev A A Beeko,\nLondon Ghanian Chaplain\nPlagiarists\nunite!\nDear Sir,\nOne of the recent events of the HG Wells\nSociety was an excellent talk on the use of\nLaser Weapons in space, given by Professor\nNew of the Physics Department. To publicise\nthis event, a poster was produced showing the\nrecent Private Eye photo of Reagan and\nSchultz contemplating the use of a paper dart\nas a space weapon, with Schultz informing\nReagan of the non-existance of Luke\nSkywalker.\nSince this poster appeared I have had two\nseparate letters from the City and Guilds\nUnion, complaining at using their artwork!\nThe first is a so-called invoice (no invoice\nnumber, no order number and no signatory)\nclaiming that we in some way used their\nfacilities to produce the poster. This\nabsolutely unfounded and ridiculous\nsuggestion is (other than in this letter) being\ngiven the total lack of attention that it\ndeserves.\nThe second letter is from the upstart of the\nmillenium, Mr Luke Walker (AAO for\nGuilds and known to his few friends as Luke\nSkywalker). In his letter he suggests that we\nare using his name for publicity without his\nconsent! If Mr Walker is big headed enough\nto think that our poster was, in some way, a reference to him, I can only pity his pathetic\ntrumped-up ego, and I will certainly not be\nasking his permission if I should utter the\nname Luke Skywalker in future.\nIf the upper echelons of the Guilds Union\nhave nothing better to do than to nurse egos\nin this haughty fashion, then I hold out little\nhope for a well organised Centenary\ncelebration week.\nYours,\nPJ Chase\nWellsoc Chairman\nLETTERS\nTO THE EDITOR\nLetters should be written double spaced on\nsingle sided A4, and should arrive not later\nthan 12.30pm on Wednesday.\nAnonymous letters are not considered for\npublication, but names can be withheld by\nrequest.\nThe deadline for small ads and Diary is\nMonday at 12.30pm.

    "content": "Founded1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union Camborne go on rampage\nThe cancellation last weekend of the RSM rugby and\nhockey matches against the Camborne School of Mines\nallowed no escape for the bottled up energy which erupted\ninto near-riotous behaviour by the Camborne Miners\ncausing several hundred pounds worth of damage.\nThe visit was for the annual\nweekend of sporting fixtures\nwhich is held alternately at\nCamborne and IC.\nTrouble first started during a dinner in College which resulted\nin one person being taken to\nhospital with glass in his eye, and\na waitress at the meal being\npelted with cooked tomatoes.\nAfter dinner the Camborne\nminers went on the rampage, first\nthrough the RS M building\nknocking photographs off walls\nand climbing out through\nwindows before going on to\nSouthside where a window was\nbroken and the electric lock on\nthe door leading to the bar was\ndamaged.\nA bill for the damage has been\nforwarded by Geoffrey Reeves,\nCollege Security Officer, to the\nRoyal School of Mines as they\nwere the hosts. It is not known\nwhether the Cambbrne miners\nwill be asked to pay for any\ndamage.\nIn a statement to FELIX, Geoffrey Reeves said, 'it's the\nbehaviour that we expect from\nMiners and they'll have to pay for\nit.'\nEstates decision\nreversed\nWillis Jackson House will not\nnow be evacuated this month\nfollowing representations by\nICU President, Ian Bull to senior\nmembers of College.\nThe original plans to begin\nimprovement work at the end of\nFebruary have been dropped and\nit has been agreed that\nimprovements will only be\ncarried out during vacations so\nthat there will be no disruption to\nstudents.\nAs previously reported in\nFELIX all houses in Evelyn\nGardens need improvement\nincluding installation of fire\ndoors and fire escapes. So far\nonly one order for work to be\ncarried out has been served by the\nRoyal Borough of Kensington\nand Chelsea, however their\nHousing Officer has agreed to\npostpone any action after\nhearing that students will have to\nbe moved out.\nImprovements to Willis\nJackson House will begin during\nthe Easter vacation and should\nbe completed during the summer\nvacation. It is not known how\nlong it will take to bring all the\nhouses in Evelyn Gardens up to\nthe standard required by the\nHousing Acts.\nWho dares win\nThe President of ICU has been\nmandated to check as many Daily\nMirror bingo cards as possible to\nhelp allie v ate the Union's finance\nproblems, following a motion\nthat was passed at last Tuesday'sU GM. The meeting opened ten\nminutes late, and was chaired by\nChris Hendy in the absence of the\nusual chairman, Sean Davis, who\nwas fast asleep.\nAll the officers reports were\naccepted, and the meeting moved\non to the changes in the Union\nBy-Laws. A small amendment to\npart of the changes proposed by\nAnn Collins R CSU President was\npassed, despite Eric Darbyshire\nHon Sec saying that the\namendment was trivial and\nwould not change the meaning or\nalter the clarity of the\nconstitution. This section of the\nchanges will now not become\neffective until it has been passed\nat aUG M next term.\nThe motion on Union Finance\nproposed by Grenville Manuel\nComputing 1 was debated next.\nA procedural amendment was\nput forward by Alan Rose to\nchange the word 'President' to\n'Mr G Manuel' throughout\nwhich would force Mr Manuel to\ncheck the bingo cards. This was\nvery narrowly defeated, and after\na few questions the motion itself\nwas carried almost unanimously,\nwith only Ian Bull ICU President\nvoting against it.\nFollowing this J Martin Taylor\nintroduced some changes to the\nelection rules to clarify some\npoints about publicity and close\nsome loopholes.\nIan Bull has so far been\ndisappointed with the response\nof students passing on bingo\ncards to him. Anyone wishing to\nhelp Union finances should take\ncards up to the Union office.\nPictured above are Michael Newman (an ex-student at IC), Adrian\nHenri and Ralph Steadman. Mr Steadman showed slides of his\npictures from a forthcoming book to ICCND on Thursday. He also\ndonated an autographed print which is to be the prize in the ICCND\nart competition. Adrian Henri read several of his poems about peace,\nwar and love.\nFree! Friday 15 February 1985 No 696\n\n"

    "content": "NEWSD\nUGC visit IC\nThe University Grants\nCommittee (UGC) visited the\nCollege last Wednesday on a fact\nfinding mission, and met\nstudents, welfare officials, non-academic staff, academic staff\nand senior administrative staff,\nin order that the full cross-section\nof interests at IC was\nrepresented.\nThe UGC is responsible for\nallocating the total grant made\navailable by the DES to\nuniversities and to advise the\ngovernment of their financial\nneeds.\nThe twenty members of the\nUGC are appointed by the\nEducation Minister. Most are\nacademics, but they serve in an\nindividual capacity\u2014n cine represents any particular\ninterest.\nThe purpose of their five-yearly visits is to discover more\nabout the present requirements\nand special problems of the\nCollege.\nThe various interest groups,\nincluding IC Union, were able to\nmake representations to the\nUGC. The Union delegation\nconsisted of the Sabbatical\nOfficers, and other Union\nOfficers associated with\nacademic, sport and overseas\nstudent affairs.\nThe Union made three\npresentation to the UGC, in a45 minute session.\nOn sport and recreation\nfacilities the Union pointed out\nthe inadequacies of the present\nfacilities.\nThe problems faced by\noverseas students, particularly\nthe arbitrarily set high fees, were\nhighlighted. The related\nproblems of isolation, compounded by the cost of\nliving, were brought home.\nThirdly the broader, and more\nproblematic area of accommodation, travel and the student\ngrant were emphasised. The extra\nexpense and problems associated\nwith living, studying and\ntravelling in London were\nbrought to the attention of the\nUGC, particular y those members\nwho did not fully understand the\nimplications of living in cnet ral London.\nSome of these problems were\nalso covered in presentations by\nthe other interest groups,\nparticularly welfare.\nWhile showing sympathy, the\nChairman, Sir Peter SwinnertonDyer, said that there was little the\nUGC could do about these\nproblems.\nOn accommodation he said\nthat both sports buildings and\nstudent residence were of low\npriority. The UGC recognizes\nthat even loan-financed building,\nfeasible in the provinces, is out of\nthe question in London.\nAs for overseas students Sir\nPeter said that Imperial doesn't charge as much as other\ninstitutions, and bearing in mind\nits position as a centre of\nexcellence it ought to be charging\nmore.\nThe concluding session of the\nday involved the UGC meeting\nrepresentatives of the Governing\nBody in order that the UGC\ncould make general points and\nrespond to points raised during\nthe day.\nSir Peter said that the UGC\nhad received a silent response\nfrom the Government on level\nfunding. His best guess for the\nfinancial future of the\nuniversities was a1.5% to 2% pa\ncut in real terms. This would\ncontinue until the Government\nrealised how much damage they\nwere causing, or the situation\nchanged due to the decline in\nstudent numbers.\nThe UGC re-affirmed its\ncommitment to an increased\ndegree of selectivity, primarily on\nthe basis of quality of research.\nHe added that IC will be\nconfident to benefit from such\nselectivity: the question was\n'Would IC continue to be\nfavourably funded, or become\neven more favourably funded?'\nOn PhD submission rates Sir\nPeter said that IC was no better\nor worse than average, but was\nconsiderably worse than\nCambridge, and ought to be\nasking itself why. Perhaps IC\nmay expect too much of its\nstudents by way of volume as well\nas quality, he thought, and there\nwas too much emphasis on the\nadvancement of knowledge.\nThe question of relating the\nblock vote to research contract\nincome was raised. Sir Peter said\n'My own philosophy would be To\nhim that hath shall be given. My\nperception of the Secretary of\nState's attitude is We shall not\nactually look and see what you get,\nbut we will estimate what you\nought to be able to get.''\nNew code for\nPhD students\nA new code of practice for the\nguidance of research supervisors\nand PhD students has been\nproduced by the vice chancellors'\ncommittee on academic quality\nand standards, which deals with\nadmission of research degrees,\nchoice of research topic,\nsupervisor and final exam-i nations. The code proposes that a statement on the subject of\nsupervision is sent to both\nstudent and supervisor before\nresearch begins outlining their\nduties and responsibilities. The\nresponsibilities of the supervisor\nwould include giving guidance on\nthe nature of research and the\nstandard expected; maintaining\ncontact with the student through\nregular tutorial and seminar\nmeetings; being accessible to give\nadvice; requesting written work\nand returning it with constructive\ncriticism; giving details of\ncompletion dates of particular\nstages of work and pointing out\nany inadequacies.\nThe students responsibilities\nwould include discussion with\nthe supervisor about the type of\nguidance which is helpful, taking\nthe initiative in raising any\nproblems; maintaining progress\nof the work; providing an annual\nreport to the head of department\nand deciding when to submit the\ncompleted work.\nThe statement should also\ninclude a procedure to be\nfollowed if an effective working\nrelationship is not formed.\nOn the subject of final\nexaminations, it is proposed that\nthe examiner's recommendation\nshould take one of the following\nforms: immediate award of the\ndegree; award after minor\namendment made to the\nsatisfaction of the internal\nexaminer; revision and re-submission; formal submission\nfor a lower degree or rejection\nwith no right of re-submission.\nWhen You Wanna Go\nI* The Farebusters\nHOW COST FLIGHTS WORLDWIDE\n\u2022 TRANSALPINO AND EUROTRA1M\n\u2022 ADVENTURE TOURS\n\u2022 SKI HOLIDAYS\n\u2022ISIC CARDS\n\u2022 WEEKEND BREAKS\n\u2022 TRAVEL INSURANCE\n\u2022 GROUP RATES\nULU Travel A Service of\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nTHE JUNIOR COMMON ROOM\nSHERFIELD BUILDING\nPRINCE CONSORT ROAD\nSW7 2AZ TEL: 01-581 8882 40 S?

    "content": "FEATURED\nUtotfUuj wt we wm Half-way up the Union Building west staircase, tucked away\nbehind the gym changing rooms, an inconspicuous sign above an\ninconspicuous door announces 'Graffitti'. It is here that the more\nadventurous and colourful posters which from time to time adorn\nthe Sherfield walkway are printed. FELIX takes a look at ICU's only 'non-performing' arts society.\n'Silk .screening' is a highly skilful, extremely\ntime consuming, and wonderfully messy art-form. You do not need to be a second Renoir\nto be able to print with screens, but is does\nrequire care and dexterity and, if you are\ncreating your own design, a degree of\nimagination. Basically the technique involves\npassing ink through a stencil which has been\nprepared on a 'screen'\u2014nowdays made from\nsynthetic mesh rather than silk. Screening\nwas developed as a manual method, and\nthough modern processes now use vacuum\nbeds and automatic rollers, Graffitti's printing is still done entirely by hand.\nThe first step in making up a screen is to\nprepare the stencil. On the simplest level this\nis done by cutting holes in grease-proof\npaper or, for more complex designs a special\ntwo-ply material is used. This consists of a water-soluble chemical film on a polymer\nbacking. Sections of the film are cut out and\nthe remainder can be 'partially dissolved'\nonto the screen. When dry, the backing can\nbe peeled away, leaving certain areas\nblocked with the film and thus impervious to\nink. In a similar manner, a light-sensitive\nmaterial can be processed photographically\nusing art work ready-prepared on a transparency. To print the image, ink is\npushed through the screen with a rubber\nblade\u2014the 'squeegee' (this is the messy bit).\nGraffitti's primary function is to provide\nfacilities for students to produce their own\nwork. As well as using screens to print\ndesigns, members have the opportunity to\nuse the society's air-brush for more creative\nand advanced art-work. The vast majority of\nthe work done in Graffitti, however, is\ncommissioned by other college societies,\nusually advertising their own events. Most\nDramsoc and Sci-fi soc posters are screen\nprinted and many other societies are\nbeginning to take advantage of the wide\nvariety of work which is possible. Within the\nUnion Graffitti is the only alternative service\nto the FELIX printing facilities. Screen\nprinting, however, is a much more flexible\nprocess than 'offset-litho' as used in the print\nunit. Any size of paper can be silk screened,\nsweat-shirts and T shirts can be decorated;\n_\n: ;l>y Bert ok Bi^ch t \u2022' Howard Brenton\nThe Galileo poster; but only one colour\nin fact just about anything which is flat can be\nprinted using screens. The process also\ngreatly facilitates the production of multi-colour designs. Graffitti chairman Andy\nMerritt worked continuously for 24 hours to\nbring out Dramsoc's famous six-colour\n'Galileo' poster last year. This would have\nbeen impossible on the FELIX litho.\nThe chief drawback of silk screening is\nthat quantity is severely limited. Because the\nprocess is highly labour-intensive, and\nbecause of the materials and equipment\nused, it is not normally possible to produce\nmore than 150 prints using any one screen.\nThe quality of printing is nevertheless\nsuperb.\nGraffitti is a relatively small society and\nmost of the printing jobs are done by a handful of enthusiasts. For some intangible\nreason, it seems also to be dominated by the\nchemistry department. If you would like to\ntry your hand at screen-printing, or just learn\nmore about how it's done, get in touch with\nany of the following:\nAndy Merritt (Chairman)\u2014Chem PG (int\n4528)\nJan Scicinski (Hon Sec)\u2014Chem 2\nSean MacRae (Treasurer)\u2014Chem 2\nMiriam Ibbotson (Workshop Manager)\n-Chem 2\nAlternatively, leave a note under RCC in\nthe Union office letter racks. Anyone not in\nchemistry will be particularly welcome.\nFELIX Friday 15 February 1985 7\n\n"
