    "content": "Continued from page 9.\nabject nervousness, wondering \"will she pick\non me?\" or from the look in the eye of the lady\nbehind me...\"oh my God,...she's picked on me!!!\" It really is Intercourse with Dame Edna\nand she carries on a rapport with the audience\nthat at times resembles an afternoon tea party\nround at Gran's.I just could not stop laughing\nthroughout her time on stage, and as the tears\nstreamed down my che esk the set was transformed into a glittering Edna rama complete with marsupial in tree.\nAudience participation is the feature of the\nshow and I'm the last person to give away any\nof the secrets, you'll have to jog around to\nDrury Lane and buy your own way in, but one\nthing I will say is that there are glad dies, and\nthey appear in their hundreds.\nWhen we all left the theatre for the tube\n(no, not the Fosters type!) resplendent with\narms full of glad dies the old station brought\nback memories of the Old Garden and I do\nbelieve I caught a nostalgic tear in the eye of\nthe lift attendant as we all descended the shaft.\nAndy Best\nOperation Bad Apple by G.F. Newman.\nDirected by Max Stafford-Clark, Royal\nCourt Theatre\nOperation Bad Apple, by the novelist and\nscriptwriter G.F. Newman, is about police\ncorruption. Newman first achieved prominence\nwith a series of tough but realistic police\nnovels, but in 1978 his four television films\nforming the basis of Law and Order were\ntransmitted by the BBC and generated considerable critical acclaim and no small\nmeasure of controversy. Operation Bad Apple\nis his first stage play.\nThe play examines the inside world of the\nMetropolitan Police. An outside police force\ninvestigates possible corruption in the Met in\norder to throw out the 'odd bad apple in an\notherwise sound barrel'. A big fish is netted,\nbecomes an informant, and in his naming a huge number of corrupt policemen it turns out\nthat no less than ninety-five per cent of the\nCID is corrupt. At this point the Director of\nPublic Prosecutions and the Attorney General\ndecide at a golfing match that enough is\nenough. The ext et it of corruption must not\nleak out to the general public otherwise a complete breakdown of law and order would\nensue together with a bringing down of the\ngovernment in office. Therefore only a handful\nof policemen would be brought to trial.\nWhether the CID is really as corrupt (and\ncorrupt in its higher echelons) as Newman\nwould suggest is of course open to debate. But\nmore importantly perhaps the play throws up\nuncomfortable questions about society itself.\nIs society not hypocritical in demanding a police force that gives results and that is at the\nsame time free from corruption when society\nitself is corrupt? It is even possible that the\npolice force is more corrupt than other public\norganizations because the opportunity tor\ncorruption is so much greater.\nThe play does have its faults but it is\nnevertheless a tense, gripping and hard-hitting\npiece of narrative drama that is well worth\nseeing. The theatre is very close to Sloane\nSquare tube station, and seats and standby i tickets are very modestly priced. The play f ends on March27. gw4 Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World by\nSimon Welfare and John Fairley, Fontana\n\u00a34.50, 320 pages.\nClarke's name is printed in large letters on the\ncover of the book, even though he's written\nonly an introduction and short commentaries\nafter each chapter. In the same way as in the\ntelevision series, he' s being used as a( doubtless well paid) sales gimmick to push a product made by someone else. And Clarke\nhasn't lost an opportunity to advertise his own\nToby Salaman, Nigel Terry and Colin\nMcCormack im operation Operation Bad\nApple.\nThe Forest by Alexander Ostrovsky in a new translation by Jeremy Brooks and\nKitty Hunter Blair. Directed by Adrian\nNoble, the Royal Shakespeare Company\nat the Aldwych Theatre.\nThe highly acclaimed production of The Forest\nreturns to the Aldwych Theatre after sell-out\nseasons at the Warehouse and the Other\nPlace (in Stratford). Written in 1871, The\nForest is considered to be one of Ostrovsky's masterpieces. Although virtually unknown in\nthis country Ostrovsky is acknowledged as\none of Russia's leading playwrights and his\nplays (he wrote forty-eight) are still very much\na part of the Russian repertoire today.\nTwo impoverished wandering actors, a tragedian and a comedian, meet at a crossroads in a forest. They stand beneath a signpost that points towards 'the estate of Mrs Goormizkskaya'. She is the tragedian's aunt,\nthe estate the scene of all his childhood memories. It is the encounter of these two life-hard ed actors with the decorous and hypocritical provincial 'society' that provides\nmuch of the comedy and the moral core of the\nplay. The play's characters are a marvellous\narray of highly amusing, colourful and effusive\nindividuals. The play reflects Ostr ov sky' s lifelong love of the theatre, his respect for\nactors and his understanding that we all (and\nparticularly the upper classes) get trapped to\nsome extent in the roles in which we have\nchosen to cast ourselves.\nThe remaining performances of the play,\nwhich I recommend highly, run from February\n24 to 17. Standbys are available.\nNick Bedding\nbooks, five out of the twelve commentaries\ncontain plugs for his own stories.\nThe book itself is fairly boring with far too\nmany uninteresting and minor mysteries diluting the more spectacular ones. \"Strangest\nof all these (objects turning up in unexpected\nplaces) is undoubtedly the collection of ancient\nChinese porcelain seals found all over Ireland\nin the late 18th and 19th centuries\". Trivia like\nthat fill up most of the book, but there are\ninteresting chapters such as the one about the\nexplosion in Siberia in 1908. If they'd cut about\ntwo hundred pages, the book would have been\nworth reading, but in it's present form it isn't worth the price.\nWednesday, February 10\nFootball\nIC I vs LSE I35( A) IC II vs LSE II 5-0(A) IC III vs LSE III 5-1 (A) IC VI vs LSE IV 5-4(A) Rugby IC I vs St Mary College 16-10(H Hockey\nIC I vs City & Guilds 4-0(H) Saturday, February 13\nFootball\nIC I vs Q MCI53( H) IC II vs QM C II 5-()(H) IC IV vs QM C III 2-5(H) Rugby IC I vs Sidcup 24-3(A) IC II vs Sidcup 17-7(A) Hockey\nIC I vs St Bernards Hosp 0-3(H) IC II vs Old Creightonians 3-1 (A)_ Football\nFirsts\nFocus on \u2014 Dave Dean\nNickname \u2014 007\nHeight \u2014 5 feet (square)\nWeight \u2014 what for\nResidence \u2014 Brixton\nOccupation \u2014 rioter/student\nMarried \u2014 ?\nChildren \u2014 not sure\nHow many \u2014 still not sure\nFavourite likes \u2014 fame and groupies\nDislikes \u2014 lack of lame, lack of groupies,\nwashing the kit.\nWho would you most like to meet? \u2014 K.

Tavlor\nDear Mr Smith\nI as the former IC Entertainments Committee Disco\nOfficer wish to announce my\nformal resignation from the\npost.\nI have submitted the major\nreasons for my resignation in\na letter to the entertainments\ncommittee. These are of a personal nature and are of no\ninterest to your readers. I would however like bring to\nyour attention some general\npoints which have disturbed\nme whilst I have been a member of the Entertainments Committee.\nThe Ents Committee does\nnot serve the musical taste of\nstudents at IC. The decisions\nin booking bands are taken by\none person alone with no\nconsultation with the other\nmembers of the committee,\nand this of course leads to a great emphasis on this one\nperson's own taste in music\nwhich I do not think conforms\nwith that of the majority of TC students. The way he covers\nup for this is by claiming that\nIC students, as a whole, have\nno taste. I illustrate my point\nby bringing to the attention of\nIC students (as if they hadn't noticed) the lack of variety in\nthe bands booked. When' Overkill' played here the\nlack of enthusiasm shown by\nleading members of the committee was bl an tent ly obvious and as no attempt\nwas made to fully promote the\nband the event was not an\n\"overwhelming success\".\nI would like to point out\nthat the Ents Committee are\nnow in a suitably sound financial position to be able to\nunderwrite a major band to\nplay at College. However, when the opportunity arose to\nbook such a band at a very\nreasonable price no attempt\nwas made by the Chairman to\ntake up the offer, despite its\napproval by the Entertainments Committee, and he\ndelayed making a decision for\nso long that the band in question eventually lost\ninterest and in the end did not\nwish to play the gig. The band to which I refer is King Crimson. Instead the Chairman went ahead and booked\na lesser band of his own choice\nfor that date, a deal which\nlater fell through, so now IC students will not see a major\nband performing at THEIR College this year, while the\nEnts Committee enjoy a large\nprofit.\nTours sincerely\nSteven Bramwell\nChem Eng 1\nDear Mark\nI have been moved to write\nto you to complain about the\nposters public ising the Links\nCarnival.

    "content": "HOW TO APPLY\nPoints to Remember\nApplications for flats will only be accepted from groups. This means that\nif you want to live in a flat or a double room/flat let, you will need to apply\nas a group of two, three, four, five, six, seven or eight. If you apply on\nyour own, you can only be considered for a single room/beds it. If you are also applying to a Hall of Residence or to a Student House,\nyour application to the Hall or House will be withdrawn once you have\nbeen allocated to a place in a Head Tenancy.\nYou can only make one application to Head Tenancies.\nThis means that if, for example, you apply in a group, you cannot also\nmake a separate application on your own, nor can you make an\napplication with another group.\nGroup Applications\n1. You will need: one orange form for the whole group and a grey card for\neach member of the group\u2014so a group of four would need one orange\nform and four grey cards.\n2. The person whose name is at the top of the list on the orange form will\nreceive all correspondence relating to the application. Thus the two\nsticky labels should be filled in, one giving that persons departmental\naddress so that we can notify him/her of the outcome of the application\nat the beginning of the Summer term. The other label should be\naddressed to his/her expected whereabouts in early September so that\nwe can send any additional information that may be necessary.\n3. Look through the table of Head Tenancies and see which ones have\naccommodation suitable for a group of your size. If there are more than\none, place them in order of preference by writing \" 1 , or 1, etc.\" in the\nappropriate spaces on the form. If there is only one, put \" 1 \" in the\nappropriate space.\n4. Fill in the rest of the orange form.\n5- Each member of the group must then complete a grey card.\n6. Return the orange form together with ALL the grey cards to the\nStudent Services Office by Friday, March 12, 1982.\nSingle Applications\n1. You will need one orange form, one grey card and two address labels.\nThe labels should be completed as follows: one with your departmental\naddress, one addressed to your expected whereabouts in early\nSeptember so that we can send any additional information that may then\nbe necessary.\n2. Lexham Gardens, Earls Court Square and Redcliffe Street both\nhave accommodation suitable for people applying on their own. The\nchart shows the number of places that each has. Indicate your preference\nby placing \" 1 \" or \"2\" in the appropriate places.\n3. Return the completed form and card to Student Services, 15\nPrinces Gardens by Friday, March 12, 1982.\nGeneral Points\n1. The way the allocation system works, the chances are that you will\neither get your first choice or nothing. The only exception to this is that if\nyou apply for the Penthouse or Mews flats and don't get in, then you will\nbe considered for your highest subsequent choice .\n2. If you are applying in a group, experience has shown that problems\narise when smokers share with non-smokers. Please give this point\ncareful consideration when choosing your group.\nAll students who accept accommodation in double rooms and flats will\nbe jointly and severally responsible for the whole rent for their\naccommodation.\nHalls and Houses\nYou need to fill in 2 address labels and the appropriate form and card.\nThere are different forms and cards to fill in depending on whether you\nare a new-applicant postgraduate, a new-applicant undergraduate or a re-applicant.\nThese are as follows:\nNew applicant postgraduate: yellow form and card.\nNew applicant undergraduate: green form and card.\nRe-applicant: blue form and card.\nThe address labels need to be completed as follows:\nOne label addressed to yourself in your department so that we can tell\nyou, at the beginning of the Summer term, whether or not you have got a place.\nOne label addressed to yourself at wherever you will be in early/mid-September so that, if your application is successful, we can tell you\nwhich room you will be in.\nWHAT YOU WILL BE PAYING\nHere is a table of rents for this session. Like everything else, they will\nprobably be higher for the next session, but at least it will give you an idea\nof what it costs per week.\nHalls\nBeit \u00a315.50-21.00\nSouthside & Weeks \u00a323.00\nLinstead Singles \u00a330.50\nLinstead Doubles \u00a324.50\nStudent Houses and Garden Hall\nSingles \u00a320\nDoubles \u00a315.50\nTriples \u00a311.50\nHead Tenancies\nHamlet/Cambridge Gardens\nSingles \u00a317.50\nDoubles \u00a314.50\nLexham Gardens\nSingles\nDoubles\n\u00a319.00-23.00\n\u00a318.50-19.50\nEarls Court Square\nSingles \u00a319.00-22.50\nDoubles \u00a316.50-17.50\nRecliffe Street\nSingles \u00a317.00-18.50\nGerrard Mansions\nSingles \u00a315.00-20.00\nSinclair Gardens\nCollege Flats\n9 Princes Gardens\nRobert Pryor House\nPenthouse Flats\nMews Flat\nFrom \u00a319.00\nFrom \u00a316.50\nFrom \u00a316.50\n\u00a3100 per week\n\u00a380 per week\nClosing Dates for Your Diary\nFriday, March12,1982: ALL undergraduates applications, all\napplications to Head Tenancies and Student Flats (including Redcliffe\nStreet) and all re-applicants: postgraduates and undergraduates.\nFriday, July 16, 1982: Applications to RESIDENCE( i.e. Halls and\nHouses) from new applicant postgraduates.\nALL APPLICATIONS RECEIVED BEFORE THE CLOSING DATE ARE GIVEN EQUAL CO NSIDERATION.

The A team (Ray Cook, Chris Wells,\nMartin Harrison, Wai Man) bowled disappointingly although there were one or\ntwo good individual games. The B team (Jeff\nQuinn, Dave Smith, Andy Davis, Kevin Short) performed much better with all four\nbowling well above average. Due to the rail\nstrike the IC eight had to leave early before\nthe final scores had been totalled so at the\ntime of writing it was not known who the\noverall winners were, but with a total of 2336\nthe B team must have been in with an\nexcellent chance. One result that we did find\nout was that Davis and Short took third place-in the handicap series of the double section,\nbut unfortunately for them they did not get\nany trophies.\nQ Sailing\nAfter some difficulty in finding their own sailing club, Essex demonstrated their superior all round ability by beating us\nconvincingly. The first race started with\nMills and Kennedy on the line at the gun,\nand some heated short tacking resulted in\nKennedy giving a green to the opposition.\nHowever, this form was not to last for long\nand Essex were in a commanding position by\nthe first mark. The race was a foregone-conclusion with Essex finishing 1, 2, 5 and I C3,4,6.An epic start by Bennet in the second race-was unfortunately to no avail and the choice\nof the wrong side of the beat put him to the\nback of the fleet. Mills and Kennedy, however, in hot pursuit round the second\nwindward mark started to pick off the Iissex\ntail-ender s, but left it too late and were\nrobbed of victory on the finishing line.\nDespite another excellent start in the first\nrace against UL II, the team couldn't keep it\nup and having been 1, 2, 6 at the first mark,\nhad dropped to 1, 5, 6 by the third and\nfinished in these positions.\nIn the second race Mills' surprise tactics\nsurprised even himself as he collided unintentionally with the opposition. Kennedy managed to get himself involved in\na mass pile up at the third mark, hit it and\nhad to re-round. Bennet skilfully kept out of\ntrouble at the hack of the l leet. UL II thus\nclinched victory finishing 1,2, 3 with IC4,5,6. Team: Bennel. Dalton, Kennedy, Mills,\nRedman, Tounghusband.\nPS: Anyone wishing to travel to Holland with the team during the Easter holidays,\nmust contact P.

    "content": "Sword and sorcery returns with Dragons layer( A, Matthew Robbins) in which\nsorcerer's apprentice Galen (Peter MacNicol)\nis called on to kill a monstrous dragon, when\nhis master Ulrich( Ralph Richardson) is\nprematurely killed. The dragon, with the\nimpressive name Vermithrax Pejorative, is\nterrorizing Url and and cowardly King Casiodorus has made a deal to sacrifice virgin\nmaidens (selected by lottery) to save his\nkingdom from the ravages of the beast.\nThe star of the film is undoubtedly Vermithrax, who was created in miniature\nstop-motion animation form by Industrial Light\nand Magic( who supplied effects for The\nEmpire Strikes Back and Raiders of the Lost\nArk) and in full scale by the Disney studios.\nThe problem is that the impressive dragon is\nonly matched by Sir Ralph Richardson as\n.Ulrich, the other actors (especially the two\nleads) being fairly weak. The story is cluttered\nand confused and really could have been a lot\nbetter. Nevertheless, it has a few inspired\nmoments and is certainly entertaining.\nThe best release of recent weeks in my\nopinion is Lawrence Kasdan's Body Heat starring William Hurt and Kathleen Turner.\nThis is a stylish murder story in which Ned\nRecine, a seedy lawyer, falls for the wife of a rich man whom they then kill. Now this theme\nis all too familiar, but this film succeeds where\nmany others (notably The Postman Always\nRings Twice) failed. The setting is excellent\nand the script convincing, if a little clich ed at\ntimes.\nSir Ralph Richardson as Ulrich in Dragonslayer and Kathleen Turner in Bodyheat.\nKasdan has deliberately produced a tribute\nto film noir and evokes memories of such\nclassics as The Big Sleep. By adding a more\nsensual( even erotic) approach he has\nsuccessfully updated the genre. I found it an\nintriguing, exciting film.\nFans of hard action will enjoy Michael Winner's Death Wish II (X, Leicester Square\nTheatre) in which Charles Bronson once more\ndons his donkey jacket and woolly hat to wage\na private war against crime.\nThe original Death Wish was a violent and\nimpressive film, whose vigilante hero was\ncheered by cinema audiences in America. The\n\"Gee Aimer, what quaint lit'l of back streets\nare 'round here \" I overheard from a middle-aged American couple as we were being\ncarried along with the flow from Covent Garden's tube station down towards Drury\nLane. \" these British surely know how to\nkeep London's old world charm, just look y up\nat those A a argh h!!!!\"and our necks snapped back at the sight of the Drury Lane\nTheatre....\"Come and have intercourse with\nDame Edna here\" read the obscene, multi coloured neon flashes and from the foyer\nbelow came the familiar hiss of the Fosters\nring pulls and the ethnic sounds of a multitude\nof Aussies' awfully austere accents.\nOn this, the opening night of Mr Humphries'\npresentation of ten weeks of Australian culture, many of the world's most eminent\ndign i tories were present in the audience, David\nSteel, Barry Norman and Mrs Iris Clissold\n(mind you, little movements in the 'Royal Box'\nconvinced me that there was indeed an affinity\nof some sort between certain 'people' in the\nfront of the House and a certain person\nbackstage).\nWe were shown to our seats, but due to an\nun for u nate series of accidents earlier on with\nthe rehearsal audience each seat had to be\nsprayed with an air freshen er by our charming\nusherette.\nThe lights dimmed, the band began and the\nevening's euphoria forced itself upon us with\nSir Leslie Colin Patterson (Cultural Attache to\nthe Court of St. James) stately circling the\nstage. To come in late while Sir Les is in mid-phrase is to simply ask for it, to come in late\nand take your seat in one of the front three\nrows is either carelessness or social-ladder\nDame Edna Everage, mother, millionaires s, mega star, waving her glad dies. climbing, because let's face it, you're either\ngoing to be picked on or spat on whichever\ncomes first. Sir Les is the epi to my of the\nDown-under emp risa rio \u2014and the more that\nyou listen to him, the more you get the feeling\nthat Australian culture has something to offer\nus\u2014what it is, is a matter of your own taste\nand of Sir Les' bad taste. He seems to have\nproblems relating to which side he \"dresses\non\" and it certainly sticks out in his \"go uch y, appeal has waned a little and the violence has\nbecome more explicit, but the story is really\nthe same. Paul Kersey has moved from New\nYork to Los Angeles and his daughter and\nhousekeeper are killed after muggers raid his\nhome. This sets Kersey out on another spree\nof revenge killings, bringing his own retribution\nwhere police methods fail.\nBronson holds the film together, but apart\nfrom him the cast are fairly dull. Jill Ireland as\nhis unconvincing lover is particularly wooden.\nThe feeling of subdued elation as Bronson\ncorners and kills the assailants remains, but\nthe film offers nothing more than the original.\nmulti-stained, duck-egg blue bush suit\". His\nrapport with the audience grows, as it seems\ndoes the side on which he dresses! His constant imbibing of the odd Scotch or twelve\nallow his words to reach the \"paupers\" in the\n'Gods' on the wings of his saliva. With a song\nand dance routine reminiscent of 'Skippy' and\nthe Australian ballet he made his exit.\nPhil Philby, introduced by Barry Norman as\n\"the leading innovator of non-mainstream\nAustralian c in east e\" talked to us about his\nlatest film 'Cage of Darkness'. Made on a modest grant of l'^m from the Australian Arts\nCouncil the film we learn is \"poetically shot,\ntastefully recreating the torment of two lesbian\nab orig nes in an ail female Australian prison\".\nThe girls are played masterly by Joan Sutherland and Yvonne Goolagong and the\npart of the leather-clad binocular is ed warder\nby Olivia Newton-John. This was a superb\ncameo piece and developed into one of the\nevening's highlights as Phil s at iris ed most of\nthe problems associated with the Southern\ncontinent's film industry.\nSandy Stone (which I believe to be Mr Humphries' greatest creation) is a poor, dejected man, permanently reflecting on his\nlife gone by in a monotone voice. The monologues associated with Sandy reveal\nmuch about suburban life Down Under, the\nTupperware parties, looking after the kids of\nValda Clissold and revealing just how boring\nlife in the suburbs can be. You must be\nprepared to listen to Sandy because under that\ndressing gown, pajamas and hot watt er bottle\nfacade there lingers a very moving but deeply,\ndeeply funny character.\nDame Edna takes up the entire second half\nof the evening's entertainment reducing (in her\nGallipoli tights) most of the front rows to\nContinued on next page\nFELIX, February 19, 1982 Page 9\n\n"

    "content": "8.8. Wolffrs.\n8if Black Book\nHi there, old B.B. is back in action after a short rest. I'm still on the lookout for any'\njuicy bits of scandal, so if you have any\nmaterial for exposes (including dirty half-truths) then drop them in at the FELIX\nOffice. Anonymity guaranteed, of course.\nAnyway, this week I thought I'd take\nanother look around the darker recesses of\nthe College. With a little help from talkative\npeople it is quite amazing what you can find\nout. For instance, did you know the\nbackground to a front page story of two weeks\nago..\nWhilst the story \"Theft in Lexham Gardens\"\nmade the front page of FELIX 604, there are a few details which the Editor, in his wisdom,\nfailed to mention.\nSoon after it was discovered that three flats\nhad been broken into, the student manager of\nLexham Gardens, Sean Giblin, arrived to\ninvestigate. In the room of RCS Academic\nAffairs Officer Tom Owen he couldn't help\nnoticing a collection of glossy magazines\n(bearing such titillating titles as \"Victorian\nTemptation\" and \" Miss Sadie Stern's Monthly\") which had been strewn across the\nfloor by the thief. They had been torn out of an\nenvelope by the mystery assailant and Sean, in\nthe true Sherlock Holmes spirit, couldn't resist\nchecking them over for vital evidence.\nLater in the evening Sean returned with a detective and discovered that Tom had\nalready rome back and \"tidied up\", obviously\nto avoid any unnecessary embarrassment.\nThe detective produced a little metal box-and dusted the room for fingerprints, but to no\navail. As he was about to give up he said what\nhe really needed was a piece of paper or a magazine which had been gripped firmly,\nhence leaving a good impression.\nAt this point Sean casually reminded Tom\nabout his little collection, which was soon\nproduced for dusting. He was a little surprised,\nto say the least, that exhibit A in a trial could\nbe his delightful selection of tasteful adult\nliterature!\nHowever, he had nothing to fear: when the\ncovers of the books were brushed with the\ndetective's fine powder, a surprising result\nappeared. \"These are no good,\" the detective\ncried. \" They' re absolutely covered in\nfingerprints!\"\nOk my GMt A few weeks ago a rather amusing practical\njoke was played on Pallab Ghosh, H.G. Wells\nSociety Chairman, and Mr Len Moulder,\nChem Eng photographer.\nPallab, who is not renowned for his speed of\nthought, unwisely asked the FELIX staff for\nsuggestions about a speaker for the H.G. Wells Society as there was a date free which\nhe had to fill at short notice. Whilst he was\naway fetching the necessary bribes for their\nco-operation (tea in this case) the Editor\ncooked up a scheme to fool him.\nOn Pallab's return, laden with his liquid\ntreat, Steve Marshall suggested a well-known\nspeaker who was highly talented and amusing.\nLen Moulder, he said, was a linguist of great\nnote whose celebrated lecture on British\nregional accents was very popular, mainly due\nto a fascinating demonstration in which\nMoulder could pinpoint someone's origins (by\ntheir accent) to within ten miles. The other\nstaff members all agreed that Len was the ideal\nman to get and heaped praises on this amazing\nman's talents. \"He's just like Professor Higgins\nout of Pygmalion!\" Steve Marshall added for\ngood measure.\nFired with such glowing reports Pallab\nphoned Mr Moulder the next morning. Len\nwas most surprised to be put forward as a possible lecturer, explaining that as a photographer he had a keen eye for human\nresponse, but that he was no academic.\nEventually after a lot of persuasion he agreed\nto consider the idea. In a subsequent phone\ncall Len explained that he would like to give a few opinions about student life at IC (which\nmay not, for reasons of sensitivity, be repeated\nhere) and also something about \"finding\nknickers in the offices of certain Professors\".\nHowever, he finally withdrew and neither he,\nnor Mr Ghosh, were aware of the little joke,\nthat had been played.\nBe O tok Tw di Somebody noticed a strange coincidence the\nother day. When Mr Peter Rodgers took on the\npost of ICU Handbook Editor, he became the\nthird Irishman to do the job in succession. His\npredecessors were Paul Donovan and Dave\nCrabbe, both of whom hail from the emerald\nisle.\nThinking about it, the Handbook is a very\ndifficult thing to put together and involves a lot\nof hard manual labour. Rather like building\nmotorways I suppose!\nHowever a further Irish link came to mind\nwhich smacks of a conspiracy. Last year a wee\nIrish lass, Liz Lindsay, was ICU Honorary\nSecretary. This year of course we have\nanother well-known Irishman in the post\u2014\nMarc O 'Ledwold.\nSpeaking of Marc O 'Ledwold, have you ever\nconsidered the connotation of the adjective of\nhis title? Scaramouche has pointed out to me\nthat, according to Chambers Dictionary,\n'honorary' means \"without performing\nservices or without reward\". Now as a sabbatical, the secretary certainly receives a reward, so we are forced to conclude\nScupp&ieA\nIf you've ever arrived at a room in the Sherfield\nBuilding expecting to play your badminton\nmatch or have a meeting, only to find it already\noccupied by several hundred inscrutable\norientals chanting mantras and smoking\nopium, then you have no doubt already heard\nof the College Bookings Office.\nThis delightful Office is responsible for the\nhire of College facilities for conferences,\nparties, etc., to staff, students and outside\norganisations (who pay well for the privilege).\nMid-way through 1981 a new bookings\nmanager, Mr Tony Schaffner, was appointed\nwho was a salesman in every sense of the word\nand immediately started to book out every\nroom in sight. This resulted in a series of mismatched and ill-timed events (for instance the\nRCS Centenary Ball clashed with an IC\nSymphony Orchestra Concert).\nHowever, shortly before Christmas Mr\nShaffner mysteriously disappeared!\nSenior members of the College administration were questioned and all seemed to\ngive the same answer: \"He was here one day\nand gone the next. We don't know what\nhappened.\"\nIntrigued by such obvious evasion from the\nlick spittle s,I broke off from my search for\nLord Lucan and was soon hot on the trail.\nWhat actually happened on that fated day\nwas pieced together over the intervening\nperiod.\nOne thing is certain. Mr Shaffner was\nsacked by Captain Lindley, Domestic\nSecretary and his immediate superior. The\nBookings w izz kid was summoned to the old\nsalt's presence and soon returned in a temper,\nslamming the doors as usual. He threw his files\nand dentures into his tatty briefcase, gave a cry of \"Skupperedr and hasn't been seen\nsince.\nThe horrendous crimes which he must have\ncommitted to have been sacked are not\nknown. But jobs are protected like gold in the\nSherfield Building and most senior people are\nusually well on the road to senile decay when\nthey're put out to grass.\nBut perhaps his views on Captain Lindley\nwere a contributing factor. Once he was heard\nto remark \"When I first came I thought FELIX\nwere being a bit hard on the old duffer. But\nafter working with him for six months I 've\nfound out that he's a complete idiot.\"\nStem WlmkM^ Eni cfa Cmm\nThe Oily Dow son Memorial Prize for\nmisleading headlines was today presented to\nMr M.A. Smith, the FELIX Editor. He takes\nthe title from the current holder, Mr S.

Recently they\ndistributed a six page photocopied new sheet called \"Radical\" to advertise themselves to the\nstudents at IC. The sheet contains an editor's introduction, eight articles varying in length\nfrom about one hundred to eight hundred\nwords, ten cartoons, a joke, and an invitation\nfrom the editor to send comments and\ncriticisms.\nThe ostensible purpose of the sheet is, of\ncourse, to persuade us to support the socialist\nmovement and to convince us of the failure of\ncapitalism. And some of the writers really have\ntried to address a wide audience and have\nmade concessions in their articles to the\napathetic or conventional-minded atmosphere\nat IC. The writer of an article on the Scarman\nReport, for example, seems to have realised\nthat if you simply denounce the police as a bunch of racist thugs then three-quarters of\nthe readers will dismiss it instantly. So\nalthough the police 'have racist tendencies' it's because of 'the pressures we and the\ngovernment put on them'. But even this writer\ncan't resist ascribing the most fantastically\ndevious and cunning motives to the socialists'\npolitical enemies. Of the idea of letting under\nqualified people into universities (a Scarman\nrecommendation) we're told: 'It is just a way\nthe government can save even more money by\nensuring more people get kicked out after one\nyear!' Elsewhere it's stated that '(multi-nationals') methods are so insidious (that) very\nfew people even seem aware of what they get\nup to Be on your guard.' There's an\nunwillingness on the part of 'Radical' writers\n(and this is true of left wing writing in general)\nto admit that their enemies are normal people.\nInstead, multinational company directors, right\nwing politicians and so on are portrayed as\nmonsters of greed and cunning, eager to\ndestroy the whole world if it gets them a better\ndividend. But a lot of students at IC can expect\nAs the hu sting and election season is here\nagain, many of you, like me, will remember\nprevious aspiring presidential candidates\ntalking a lot of hot air, and making unrealistic\npromises.\nAs I see it, the minimum service that we can\nexpect from any president is that s/ he tries to:\nimprove refectory conditions.\nbetter the accommodation situation.\nimprove lecturing standards.\nfight education cuts sensibly.\nget a fair deal for over sea students.\noversee welfare work in College.\nThese are broad headings and undoubtedly\nyou will be able to think of many others. These\nduties are 'ex officio' and no fuss should be\nmade about them during the campaign. By\nto work for a big company when they graduate\nand they'll tend to identify with the very people\nbeing attacked in 'Radical'. (And the articles\nattack them personally, not the system they\nhave to work within). So a cartoon showing a disgustingly fat white man (the West) carelessly\nscattering crumbs to a starving black (the\ndeveloping world) is hardly likely to awaken\nsocialist sympathies among the future\nmanagers and industrialists at IC. It's just\ngoing to cause irritation and resentment\namong people who might be open to\npersuasion.\nAgain, a comment in the Editor's Intro\npointlessly an tag on is es some of his readers:\n' Please ex s cuse( sic) any spelling or\ngrammatical P TO S as we can't all have a public\nschool education ' Why insult people who\nwent to a public school, as if it was their fault?\nApparently the kind of people who write for\n'Radical' regard ex-public schoolboys as sub human, just good for being sneered at. You aren't going to get people on your side thai\nway, but a great deal of Radical and other\n'socialist' literature is written without any\nintention of persuading the reader to join the\ncause. Throughout the whole sheet there's an\nunderlying holier-than-thou atmosphere that\nsays something like 'we're good socialists and\nyou're all apathetic nobodies, and don't you\nforget it'. This is sometimes stated almost\nexplicitly. For example in ' Our Glorious Union Leadership?' we're told that 'the recent\nrejection by IC Union of NUS is just one more\nexample (what are the others?) of Imperial\nCollege students sticking their heads in the\nsand'. Articles like that are hardly more than a list of prefabricated slogans, highly effective for\nputting people off socialism. But a great many\nsocialists don't care whether they put people\noff or not. The writing of articles denouncing\ncapitalist exploiters, American imperialists,\netc., etc., is for them an end in itself, a sort of\nritual that you're expected to take part in if\nyou're a good socialist. They seem to regard it\nas beneath them to try and get popular\nsupport.\nAt a leftist meeting in the College recently\nsomeone was suggesting that Left candidates\nfor Union post should stand without saying\nthat they were leftists because then they'd have a better chance of standing unopposed.\nThe person who advocated this ' secret candidate' approach was grinning as he put\nforward the idea. To him, dishonest political\nman oe uv rings are more important than policy\nconsiderations or trying to get popular support. This is the low level at which politically inclined minds tend to work. And left\nwing clubs are full of pe op lle like that. What do\nthey expect to accomplish? The Socialist\nSociety might succeed in getting a few people\nto join them, but they won't get very far so long\nas they remain hardly better than a mutual\nadmiration society.\nwhich I mean, let's cut out the rubbishy\nrhetorics e.g. from last FELIX, the three\narticles generalized and claimed, I quote \" it\nis of vital importance to elect a President who\nis not going to let himself be pushed\naround \" or \" leading in a definite\ndirection \" or \" The Union needs strong\nleadership \"\nIt is therefore important that we press all\ncandidates to state exactly how they aim to\nachieve their goals, what methods and routes\nwill they use and what effects will this have on\nus students.\nRemember they are elected by you to serve\nyou, and we are entitled to know how and\nwhat they are going to do, not what they\ndream of doing.\nHow to choose a President\nby Aung Htun\nPage 4 FELIX, February 19, 1982\n\n"

    "content": "COLLEGE ACCOMMODATION\nIntroduction\nThis guide is intended to give you an idea of what the College has to offer\nin the way of accommodation and of the regulations which control the\nway in which the accommodation is allocated. Hopefully, this will help\nyou to choose the type of accommodation which best suits your particular requirements and will save you from the effort of making applications which are unlikely to be successful. The guide gives information about the three basic types of College accommodation. Purpose built Halls of Residence which are all on campus; Student Houses which are large Victorian houses converted into student accommodation, most of which are concentrated in Evelyn Gardens, about fifteen minutes walk from the College; and, Head Tenancies, which are not owned by the College, but are leased from landlords and sub-let to students. These are situated in Kensington, Earls Court and Hammersmith. Since there is not all that much difference between individual Halls and between individual Houses, the guide gives emphasis to the Head Tenancies, which tend to be much more varied.\nApplication forms for students already at the College and for new postgraduate students, will be available from the Student Services Office,\n15 Princes Gardens and should be completed and returned by Friday, March12. Applications from postgraduate students who have not lived in Residence before as postgraduates and who are applying to live in Halls and Houses should be returned by Friday, July16. How College Accommodation is Allocated\nA. RESIDENCES\nHalls, Houses\nThe following extract from the \"Imperial College Student Residence Halls\nand Houses Regulations and Information\" makes it crystal clear. Note particularly the underlined bits.\n4. Applications for residence from students will be considered in the\nfollowing categories:\na) First year undergraduates are admitted to residence on the\nrecommendation of the College departments. The allocation of first\nyear places among the Halls and Houses and between departments is\nregulated by the Students' Residence Committee.\nb) Undergraduate new residents will be selected by a random method.\nc) Undergraduate and postgraduate read missions are selected by a sub-committee of each Hall and House Committee whose members\nhave not applied for a further year in residence.\nd) Postgraduate new residents are admitted to residence on the\nrecommendation of the College departments. Junior Research Assistants* are also eligible to apply within this category.\nWardens all have the power to refuse any application to their Hall or\nHouse after discussion with the Hall or House Committee. A certain number of places will be reserved for medical, welfare and compassionate cases as recommended by the Medical Officer or Student Counsellor in consultation with Wardens.\n* Members of Staff who, for administrative reasons, receive a net\nsalary comparable to a standard UK postgraduate student award.\n5. The following principles shall be followed in considering applications\nfor residence:\na) The normal period of residence in Hall or House for student\nmembers shall be one year.\nb) Not more than 10 per cent may be selected for a second year's residence, but no such members may reside for more than two years in\nHalls or Houses except as provided in 5(d) below and Selkirk and Vickers' Scholars.\nc) The proportion of postgraduates in any Hall or House shall be\nabout 15 per cent of the student members; any IC undergraduate\nbecoming a postgraduate will re qualify for entry.\nd) If a student, having been resident for two years, is elected an\nofficer of the Union, as listed in Regulation 2 above, he shall be permitted\nto reside for a third year, but none other than the President, Deputy\nPresident and the Secretary shall be permitted to reside in Halls or\nHouses for more than three years.\ne) In applying Regulations 5(b) and 5(d) above, students who take up\nresidence during the first half sessions hall be considered as re-applicants for any further applications. Students taking up residence during the second half-session will be considered as new app li cants for the following application.\nApplying as a New Undergraduate Student\nApplication forms are sent out to new undergraduate students by the\nCollege Registry once an offer of admission to the College has been firmly\nor provisionally accepted. Undergraduate admissions tutors nominate a certain number of applicants to places in Residence. The remainder are advised to apply to Intercollegiate Halls and, if unsuccessful, can ask to be placed on the waiting list for Imperial College Halls and Houses. Applying as New Applicant\nIt is the policy of the Students' Residence Committee to attempt to provide residence places for all third year undergraduates who have not lived in Residence before. It is anticipated that this year we will be able to\noffer places to all third year new applicants, and also to a number of\nsecond year new applicants.\nApplying as a Re-applicant\nThe reason for having a re-applicant system is that it is thought that if\nthere area handful of people in each Hall or House who had the\nexperience of living in residence and have shown that they have a contribution to make to the life of the community, then this will make any given Hall or House a happier place to live in. As it says in the regulations, re-applicants are chosen by a\" subcommittee of each Hall and House Committee whose members have not applied for a further year in residence.\" The significance of these regulations to your personal strategy for getting a place to live for next year lies in the fact that unless the committee which does the selection knows who you are, your chance of\nsucceeding in getting in as a re-applicant must be non existant. So, for\nexample, if you are living in a student house this year, it would in most cases be a waste of time applying to live next year in Hall. Similarily, anyone who lived in residence in their first year would find it\nvery difficult to get back for their third year if they had lost contact with the people in that particular Hall or House in the intervening year.\ni Not how re-apps are selected.\nApplying as a Postgraduate\nApplication forms for postgraduate students who have not lived in Hall before as postgraduates are available from February15 and must be returned by Friday, July16. Application forms from postgraduates new to the College together with those from new applicant postgraduates already at College are forwarded to the postgraduate admissions tutors\nin each department and the tutors then make nominations for Residence places.\nHEAD TENANCIES\nHead Tenancy applications are not affected by whether you have lived in Residence before or by what year you are in. Most of the Head Tenancy accommodation is in the form of flats or double rooms and the main requirement for applying is that you should apply with one or more others and that you will only be considered for accommodation suitable\nfor the size of the group. The most important thing is to concentrate on getting together a group of individuals who will be reliable and who are likely to be able to live together successfully for a whole session. This year, for the first time, we will be operating a system which will\n. enable new undergraduate students to live in the Head Tenancies. New students who have been nominated for Residence by their admissions tutors will be asked whether they would rather take up this option. There are no plans at present to enable new postgraduate students to live in\nHead Tenancy flats, mainly because the flats have a high proportion of\nshared rooms and most postgraduates need single rooms. It is likely,\nhowever, that new postgraduates will be able to take up single rooms in\nthose Head Tenancies which have the m,asa result of some students who are offered the rooms in May, subsequently turning them down.

    "content": "Flats and rooms in the Head Tenancy\nScheme\nHamlet and Cambridge Gardens, Lexham Gardens, 6 Earls Court\nSquare, 21 Redcliffe Street, Gerrard Mansions and Sinclair Gardens are\nall properties which have been rented by the College in order to provide\nan additional supply of guaranteed accommodation.\nThey are all places which, without the College's involvement, would\neither not be available as student accommodation or would be let at\nmuch higher rents than those which the College has been able to\nnegotiate. For example, Lexham Gardens would not be iet to students at\nall if the College hadn't taken them on and even the most expensive flats\nin Lexham Gardens are around \u00a35 per week per person cheaper than\ncomparable private sector flats in the same area.\nAnother advantage which the head tenancy flats have over places in\nthe private sector is that they give you the opportunity to live close to\nother Imperial College students, so you don't have to feel that you are\ngoing home to an alien environment.\nNevertheless, head tenancies are essentially private sector places\nwhich the College has acquired wholesale, and so there are things which\ndistinguish them from the College Residences. For example, the College\nhas to pay rent on its head tenancies during the short vacations and this\ncost has to be passed on to the people living in the accommodation\u2014\nalthough 'home' students who spend the vacations living in their\naccommodation should be able to claim most of the rent back in the form\nof supplementary benefit. Another point is that the College does not have\nthe same degree of control over furnishings and maintenance as it does\nwith its own residences. The role of the warden or student manager in the\nHead Tenancies is very different from the role of Hall or House Wardens.\nGenerally speaking, however, there is no respect in which the\nCollege's head tenancies are worse than their private sector counterparts, and there are many respects in which they are much\nbetter.\nThe head -tenancies provide a wide range of accommodation, from\nsingle flats and beds its to eight-bedded flats. To help you decide which\nwould suit you best, here is a brief resume of the various properties.\nHAMLET & CAMBRIDGE GARDENS\nHamlet Gardens\nHamlet Gardens is situated in Hammersmith, a few minutes walk from\nRavenscourt Park underground station. All the accommodation there is\nin the form of flats which range in size from three to eight-bedded units.\nThere are flats in Hamlet Gardens for groups of three, four, six or seven\nand eight totalling over 160 beds in all. The flats vary in their levels of\ndecoration and furnishings but even if you end up in one of the less well\nequipped ones there is plenty of scope for re-arranging things so that you\nend up with a pleasant place to live.\nOne big advantage of living in Hamlet Gardens is that the rents tend to\nbe lower than in the head tenancies closer to College.\nAll the flats have their own lounge, bathroom and kitchen, and\nalthough most of them only have shared bedrooms, several have single\nbedrooms as well.\nCambridge Gardens\nCambridge Gardens consists of a house containing two flats, one for a group of four and one for six. It is situated close to Ladbroke Grove\nunderground station and within walking distance of Notting Hill.\n4\n\n"

IC Radio\npersonnel are available to assist with the technicalities of the production,\nbut candidates should have an idea of what they want to say. It usually\ntakes about an hour to produce a promotion\u2014less time than pasting up a poster.

It was found that\nwithin IC there was a great deal of common ground and general\nagreement was reached that there aims could be better achieved by\nconcerted campaigns involving members from all three societies. To this\nend an informal 'left alliance' is now in existence and to get the alliance off\nto a start it has been agreed to launch an anti-apartheid campaign along\nwith Anti-Apartheid Society in order to make people more aware of the\natrocities of apartheid, (e.g. Sharpville massacre, internment without trail\noccupation of Namibia by South African forces; repression of black and\ncoloured South Africans in all walks of life), and to try and stop the\ninvolvement of IC staff and students in the apartheid regime, i.e. commitment to having no more South African students on nuclear\ntechnology courses and the end to a careers forum for companies like\nRio Tinto Zinc which is involved in Namibia. So far the IC left alliance\nhas been well supported and it is hoped that everyone in College will be\nable to contribute to the campaign against apartheid. The next mee it ng of\nthe alliance will be on Thursday, February 25, 1:00pm, Union Senior\nCommon Room.\nPimlico Connection\nThe Pimlico Connection was set up six years ago, as a tutoring scheme\nwith the idea of increasing the communication of scientific ideas. Then,\nthe numbers involved could be counted on one hand, now nearly ninety\nImperial College students travel out to five local schools.\nSubjects Tutored\nScience at all levels, but mainly pre O Level.\nEngineering\u2014mainly woodwork and metalwork. Students with individual\nworkshop experience especially appreciated.\nMathematics at ail levels.\nElectronics\u2014mainly at C SE Level.\nApproximately 13:30 to 15:30 each Wednesday afternoon in the autumn\nterm and first four weeks of the spring term.\nTravel expenses are paid. No previous experience needed.\nIf you would like to find out more, then come along (with no strings\nattached!) to Elec Eng 606 at 12:30 on Tuesday, February 23.
