The\nfocused attitude to training\ncontinued throughout the\nweek, with the first run of\neach day starting at 7.30am,\njust late enough to allow everyone to return from the previous night\u2019s activities. This\nwas followed up by an evening\nhigh intensity hills session. To\nkeep a balance, cross training methods were employed,\nwith members engaging in\nswimming, cycling and circuit\ntraining over the course of the\nweek. The distance record\nfor the week was set by club\nstalwart Dave Mulvee, who\ncompleted a century of junk\nmiles.\nThe trip was originally set\nfor four team members, but\nwas then invaded upon by out-siders. One of the team was\nageing student Gavin, reputed to be the oldest standing\nmember of Imperial College\nUnion. Gavin had also paid\nfor his estranged son Wicksy\nto come along, in a shallow\nattempt to make up for the\nlack of maintenance payments over the years. Gavin\njustified this by pointing out\nthat as long as he stayed at\nImperial he would never have\nto pay his student loan back\nto the government, and that\nthere was therefore no reason why the same shouldn\u2019t\napply to Wicksy and his moth-er. Gavin\u2019s silent motive for\nbringing Wicksy along was to\nteach him the ways of the\nworld before he became too\nold to perform.\nThe second outsider was\nclub captain turned tube driver Mike \u201cGobshite\u201d Boucher,\nfresh from the last strike and\nready for action. In fact, he\nwas so keen to stand with\nhis brothers on the picket\nline that he missed the flight\nand had to catch us up later.\nFlightstoLanzarotewereonly\navailable on Thursdays, so he\nwas forced to fly to Grand\nCanaria, aiming to swim the\nrest of the way. When this\nplan failed, he was forced to\nstrike a deal with some local\nsailors, the details of which\nhe was unwilling to disclose.\nAll that could be gathered is\nthat the deal incorporated the\ninfamous \u2018sodom stick\u2019.\nAs soon as Mike arrived, he\nwaskeentomakehismarkand\ninsisted that the group visited\nLady Muck\u2019s stand-up show.\nThe team were shocked to\ndiscover that the lady in question was in fact a man whom\nMike had previously worked\nwith. Upon arrival, we were\nescorted to the front row so\nthat we could get the most out\nof the show. Lady Muck took a\nparticular shine to Gavin and\nasked for his assistance many\ntimes throughout the night.\nWe were all surprised at how\nuntroubled Gavin was by the\nhigh level of male bonding\ninvolved, but the mystery was\ncleared up once he reminded\nus how long he had been an\nImperial PhD student.\nAs always, the team was\nkeen to forge links with other\nTraining, toffs and a tube driver\n\u201cYes officer, it was number 91, I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d Members of the Cross Country and Athletics Club outside of police custody\nBy Dan Lehmann\nEver been trucking? Enjoy\npub crawls? Want to learn to\ndrive a lorry? Well if you do\n(or even if you don\u2019t) then the\nRoyal School of Mines Motor\nClub could be for you.\nThe club is responsible for\nthe maintenance and running\nof a 1926 one tonne Morris\ntruck called Clementine, or\nClem for short. Clem has been\nat the college since the 1960s\nand she has the advantage of\nbeing fitted out with bench\nseats in the back, making her\nideal for going on pub crawls\nor trips around London.\nIf you want to learn some\nbasic mechanical skills, drink\ncups of tea, but also enjoy\nyourself socially then make\nsure you join the RSM Motor\nClub.

It was decided that\nthe most mutual benefit could\nbe attained by approaching\nthe young ladies holidaying\non the island. The level of\nsuccess was mixed, although\ncertain team members hit\nparticular stumbling blocks.\nThe first to fall was toff team\ncaptain Jon, finding that the\nsocio-economic mix of ladies\non the island were somewhat\nunresponsive to his \u201callegedly\u201d extreme right wing views.\nJeff didn\u2019t experience this\nproblem as he decided to dive\nstraight in with a more physical approach. Several young\nladies complained that these\napproaches were too intru-sive, leading to Jeff\u2019s removal\nfrom a number of clubs. We\nthink the ladies in question\nshould have been grateful\nthat he was not carrying the\nsodom stick. As a last straw,\nhe approached a middle-aged\nlady who was walking home\nwith her two teenage chil-dren. Despite multiple flattering comments, she still\nchose to return to her hus-band. Following a common\ntrend, Jeff was forced to sleep\nalone.\nThe trip put considerable\nfinancial strain on several\nmembers, especially considering the number and extent\nof rehydration sessions needed throughout the week. This\nwas exacerbated when the\npolice had to be compensated for releasing Jon and Jeff\nfrom their custody. Although\nthe exact circumstances are\nunclear, it is thought that they\nwere involved in a fracas with\na local kebab owner over the\namountofbreadthatshouldbe\nincluded with a kebab. A local\nwitness suggested that their\nattempt to perform a \u2018good\ncop bad cop\u2019 routine on the\nkebab shop owner had gone\nhorribly wrong. Desperate to\nraise funds, Mike and Dave\nheaded to the local casino.\nAfter only an hour they had\nlost a three figure sum, but\nMike shrugged it off claiming\nthat he could easily get the\nmoney back with half a dozen\nloops of the Circle Line.\nIn summary, the training\nshould provide an excellent\nbase for the coming cross\ncountry season. However, the\nunbalanced environment provided within Imperial College\nand the London Underground\nnetwork left club members\ncompletely unprepared for\nthe challenges provided\nby the women. Perhaps we\nshould all have followed in\nGavin\u2019s footsteps and found\nour own Lady Muck.\nIf you would like to know\nmore about the Cross\nCounty and Athletics Club\n(and haven\u2019t been put off too\nmuch by this article), visit\nus online at www.union.ic.ac.\nuk/acc/crosscountry or email\nrun@ic.ac.uk.\n\u201cThe police\nhad to be\ncompensated for\nreleasing Jon\nand Jeff from\ntheir custody\u201d\n\n"

Six of the current hunt staff and committee\nare either current Imperial\nstudents or graduates of the\nCollege.\nKirsty Massey, joint master of the Beagles and about\nto start a Masters course at\nWye, told Felix why she took\npart in the rally in Parliament\nSquare: \u201cWe need to show\npeople opposed to hunting\nthat we have not given up\nand will not take a ban lying\ndown.\u201d\nHenry Walker, a former student master and huntsman,\nexpressed his fondness for\nhunting and his frustration at\nthe ban: \u201cThe first time I saw\nthe Wye College pack was on\na rainy day during Freshers\nWeek. From that point on, I\nwas hooked. Everyone was\nvery friendly and what struck\nme was that everyone had a\ngenuine love for the countryside.\u201d Mr Walker continued:\n\u201cI have been to every London\nrally and hunt protest for the\nlast six years. What will we\nhave to do before they listen\nto us?\u201d\nAs the Bill was being\ndebated, hunt supporters\nfought with police outside.\nSome invaded the House\nof Commons, prompting\ncalls for drastic changes to\nParliamentary security meas-ures.\nThe Bill was passed by\n356 votes to 166. It is now\nalmost certain to become\nlaw through the Parliament\nAct, with an official ban set to\nbegin in summer 2006.\nUnsurprisingly, the Wye\nBeagles are not ready to\nadmit defeat on an issue\nabout which so many of their\nmembers feel so strongly.\nHowever, other students\nand societies at Imperial are\nlikely to support the hunting\nban.\nCoincidentally, several senior Imperial College Union\nofficers were inside Portcullis\nHouse at the time, and were\nasked whether or not they\nsupported the Bill. Most\nreplied \u201cno\u201d, citing the existence of the Wye Beagles as\nthe main reason why.\n\u201cWhat will we\nhave to do\nbefore they\nlisten to us?\u201d\nWye students join hunt\nprotest outside Commons\nHouse of disorder: there were chaotic scenes both inside and outside the Commons as the\nHunting Bill was debated last month\nGovernment\nintervenes\nin university\nscience\nfunding\nBy Emily Gwyer\nThe Secretary of State for\nEducation and Skills, Charles\nClarke, this week proposed\nchanges to the current system of university funding in\norder to preserve the teaching of science in departments\nthat might otherwise close.\nThe last ten years have\nseen a dramatic drop in the\nnumber of students enrolled\non science courses in Britain,\nparticularly the physical sci-ences, and the market-led\napproach to university funding has meant that several\ndepartments, such as the\nKings College chemistry\ndepartment, have had to\nclose.\nMr Clarke believes that\nproducing science undergraduates is of significant\nimportance to the economy\nand has therefore proposed\nnew changes to the funding\nsystem whereby new subsidies are levied or tuition fees\nwaived.\nThe news has been welcomed by the scientific com-munity, which has been lobbying Mr Clarke over the\nmatter, but his plans will\nrequire the agreement of\nvice-chancellors, who may\nsee Government intervention\nas unwelcome. The process,\nbound to be long and tortur-ous, has only just begun, but\nwe wait with interest to see\nif Britain\u2019s future science\nstudents are rewarded with\nextra money.\nBy Emily Gwyer\nFears were raised this week\nof a new epidemic of measles\nin London, as government scientists warned parents about\nthe extremely low take-up of\nthe MMR vaccine.\nLondon has the lowest\nimmunisation rate in the\ncountry, with fewer than 62%\nof babies having had the jab\nin south London and in other\nboroughs including Haringey\nand Tower Hamlets. 95% of\nthe population must be immu-nised against a disease in\norder to reduce the chances\nof two non-immunised people meeting each other to\npractically zero (this is called\n\u2018herd immunity\u2019). Without this\nimmunity, certain groups, particularly primary school chil-dren, are at risk of contracting the disease, which can\nbe fatal. Up to 20% of adult\nsufferers are hospitalised.\nThe controversy over the\nMMR vaccine began in 1998,\nwhen Dr Andrew Wakefield\nof the Royal Free Hospital\npublished an article in The\nLancet discussing bowel disease and autism. In the press\nconference for the article, Dr\nWakefield went further and\nsuggested a link between\nthe vaccine and the onset of\nautism. Although the sample\ngroup of 12 children was far\nsmaller than previous studies (which had shown no ill\neffects), it was explosive.\nNatural parental fears\nover risks to their children\nwere matched with serious\nmistrust of government sci-entists, and the newspapers\nstirred up the panic. Take-up\nof the triple vaccine has fallen\nfrom 92% before the press\nconference to the current low\nof 68%, despite many other\nstudies failing to repeat the\nfindings of Dr Wakefield. This\nwas followed by ten of the\npaper\u2019s co-authors retracting\ntheir names from the article\nand Dr Wakefield\u2019s subsequent resignation.\nMany parents remain wor-ried, bamboozled by the science and angry about the patronising attitude of government officials. An epidemic is\nnow a serious possibility.\nMeasles symptoms begin\nwith fever before a rash\nappears, usually on the head\nand then spreading to the\nbody. After three to five days,\nthe spots may blend into each\nother as the illness progress-es. Students are not at as high\na risk as young children.\n\u25cf The Imperial College\nHealth Centre\u2019s 24 hour\ntelephone number is 020\n7584 6301. Their website\naddress is www.ic.ac.uk/\nhealthcentre\nFears of new measles epidemic in London\nNeedles seem necessary: the number of people being immunised is now dangerously low\n\u201cTake-up of the\ntriple vaccine\nhas fallen to\nthe current low\nof 68%\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "Imperial College Union\nRugby Club Tour of New\nZealand 2004\nBy Richard Bishop,\nJon Freedman and\nHamish Pearse-Danker\nFollowing the success of tours\nto places such as Barbados,\nEast Canada, South Africa\nand Australia, the Imperial\nCollege Union Rugby Football\nClub (ICURFC) headed out to\nNew Zealand this summer.\nThe majority of the team\nflew in to Auckland on 2 July\nand headed up to Paihia for\nthe first match against Keri\nKeri, a local club side.\nKeri Keri 28\nICURFC 30\nAfter a hard introduction\nto New Zealand rugby, Rob\nRobinson saved the match for\nImperial with a last minute\ntry.\nThe touring party then\nheaded down to Hamilton to\nplay a Waikaito University\nVarsity team.\nWaikaito University 18\nICURFC 32\nImperial fielded their best\nside but unfortunately the\nonly specialist full back, Andy\nTowers, dislocated his shoulder late in the second half,\nruling him out for the rest of\nthe tour. However, two late\ntries and a cheeky drop goal\nensured a second win for the\ntouring side.\nDespite staying in one of\nthe worst backpackers known\nto man, the squad partied\nhard and left the next morning for Rotarua, a town built\non huge thermal activity with\nits own Polynesian Spa \u2013 very\ngood to relax and stretch out\nsore muscles.\nThe third match was\nagainst another club side,\nKahakura. Imperial trained\nthe day before the match and\ngot to watch the opposition\nplay before hitting the town\nwith them and shocking them\nby the match squad not drink-ing. Subsequently, the visitors\nwere confident of extending\ntheir winning start to the tour\nthe next morning. How wrong\nthey were!\nKahukura 35\nICURFC 10\nThe score says it all. ICURFC\ndecided that hitting the bar\nmight be appropriate.\nAfter shaking off some very\nbad hangovers, the squad\npiled back onto the bus for\na short drive to Taupo for\ntwo days of rest and relaxa-tion, though many decided\nthis wasn\u2019t a good use of\ntime. Instead, they tried\ntheir hands at jumping out\nof a perfectly good aeroplane \u2013 skydiving from 15,000\nfeet! From Taupo, the team\ndrove down to Wellington for\na match against Old Boys\nUniversity.\nWellington Old Boys 44\nICURFC 12\nImperial started the match\nafter a true show of commitment from Dave Evans,\nwho ran a mile in order to\nfetch boiling water to mould\nformer captain Tim Praill\u2019s\ngumshield. This was the best\nperformance of the day.\nArrival in the South Island\nwas a bit of a hungover blur,\nwith lots of time spent sleeping on the floor on the boat\nand then a short drive to\nNelson. Game number five\nwas against Nelson College.\nNelson College 12\nICURFC 7\nIn a match full of foul play\nand conflict, Imperial didn\u2019t\ndo themselves justice, losing\nout in a close contest. Playing\non what was basically a bog,\nthe white tour kit didn\u2019t stay\nthat way for long. The silky\nskills of ICURFC didn\u2019t get\nchance to shine, and the team\nvowed not to finish the tour\nas losers.\nNext, the tour bus moved\non to Kaikora. After two days\nof light training and drink-ing, Imperial were ready\nfor their final game, against\nCanterbury University.\nUnfortunately, disaster struck\nas the bus wouldn\u2019t start, so\nthe team arrived with only 20\nminutes to warm up and train,\nbut everyone was pumped up\nfor the game.\nCanterbury University 20\nICURFC 21\nWhat a great way to finish\na tour! In their final game\nfor Imperial, Tim Praill, Dom\nWilson, Rich Roberts and\nDuncan Rutherford played\nlike men possessed, a fitting\ntribute to their contributions\nover the years.\nImperial scored early on\nand had the majority of the\npossession in the first half.\nCanterbury came back strong\nin the second half and the lead\nswapped a couple of times,\nonly for Imperial to reclaim\nit before the final whistle and\nwin by the narrowest of mar-gins.\nThe squad left early the\nnext morning to head to\nQueenstown for a couple of\ndays\u2019 holiday. Hungover players were very scared as the\nbus slid down a hill on icy\nroads towards a bridge and\noncoming traffic, but legendary driver Bruce saved the\nteam.\nThelastnightinQueenstown\nsaw the Kangaroo Court,\nwhere tour \u2018indiscretions\u2019 are\npunished. There was some\nquality fancy dress including\na fluorescent orange dress, a\nbaby\u2019s outfit and a suit made\nout of bin liners. A lot of lager\nlater, the players stumbled\ninto town for their final night\nout amid some very cold\nweather.\nThe tour would not have\nbeen such a huge success\nwithout the contributions of\ntour manager Neil Davies and\nsponsors Singapore Airlines\nand Geoservices.\nThree victories for Rugby Club\non tour of New Zealand\nSport\nRUGBY\n1\nQuick Crossword by Cactus\n2 3 4 5 6\n7 8\n9 10\n11 12\n13 14 15 16\n17\n18 19 20 21\n22 23\n24 25\n26 27\n28 29\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 7 October 2004\n20\nAcross\n1.

There\nare university LGBT socials\npractically every week, plus\nthe annual special events\nsuch as World Aids Day and\nthe Christmas dinner. This\nyear, we\u2019ve got a boat trip\nplanned with UCL and Kings,\na salsa workshop and a self-defence course to name just\na few of our events. Our aim\nis to show that there is more\nto being gay than going to\nG*A*Y.\nAside from the social\naspect of IQ, we also offer\nsafe space meetings. All our\nmembers have had to come\nto terms with their sexuality and we\u2019ve all got a tale\nto tell. We fully understand\nthat, for some prospective\nmembers, coming along for a\nparty straight away may not\nbe your cup of tea. If you have\nany issues with your sexual-ity, we really are here to lend\na helping hand. You can contact IQ through the website\n(http://union.ic.ac.uk/iq), and\na committee member can be\nassigned to contact you via\nemail, then, on your terms,\nmeet in person.\nYou may have noticed that\nin this year\u2019s Union handbook\nwe were listed as \u2018Queers\u2019\ninstead of \u2018Imperial Queers\u2019.\nThis was caused by the policy\nof the editor to omit the prefix\n\u2018Imperial\u2019 from the names of\nall clubs and societies.

    "content": "The poor Tate Britain. Ever since\nthe opening of the Tate Modern, it\nhas been somewhat overshadowed.\nThe Tate Modern opened in such a\nblaze of publicity, of all descriptions,\nand was blessed with the added\nattraction of the first new bridge\nin London since the nineteenth\ncentury. When we say \u201cTate\u201d these\ndays, the mind immediately goes all\nthe way across town to Southwark.\nHowever, the eyes, and opinions, of\nthe nation do manage to focus on\nthe original Tate, the Tate Britain,\nonce a year: you can\u2019t avoid the\nTurner Prize.\nIt\u2019s not Turner time yet, though\nthe exhibition does open later this\nmonth. However, the Tate Britain\nhas just launched the first major\nexhibition of the work of sibling artists Gwen and Augustus John, covering the period up to the death of\nGwen in 1939. It is a surprisingly\nengaging exhibition of the very different works, and a collection that\nthe curators are at pains to point\nout was not envisaged as a \u2018compare\nand contrast\u2019 exercise.\nThe Johns were both born in Wales\nin the late 1870s and later studied at the Slade School in London\nduring the 1890s. Augustus found\nfame early on. For Gwen, fame came\nmore slowly but has been much\nmore enduring. Both lived somewhat unconventionally by the standards of the time; Augustus\u2019 lifestyle\nwould still not be considered as nor-mal. A man of apparently magnetic\npersonality, he lived for a time with\nboth his wife and his mistress, and\nall their children, in a gypsy cara-van. Gwen, despite the rather subdued and somewhat dour image that\ncomes from her paintings, was a\nstupendously independent woman.\nShe settled, living alone in Paris,\nand modelled for some of the artists of the day, most famously Rodin\nwith whom she ended up having a\nflaming affair \u2013 not really what one\nwould expect from the woman in the\npictures! Despite this, Gwen John\nremained a very private individual\nand after the death of Rodin, the\nfocus of her life became religion. By\ncontrast, Augustus John remained a\nsingularly exuberant and extroverted personality with voracious sexual\nappetites to the end of his life. The\nsignificant differences in their personalities translate themselves into\nequally different artistic styles.\nThe exhibition has been ordered\nchronologically so as to show best\nthe development of the artists\u2019\nstyles, beginning with drawings and\npaintings they produced of each\nother and their friends while still\nat the Slade, and concluding with\nworks completed just before 1940. It\nis immediately obvious, even from\nthe pictures from the early period,\nthat Gwen and Augustus had very\ndifferent outlooks on life. Augustus,\nthroughout his career, used bold\ncolour and painted his subjects in\nsuch a manner that their person-alities, usually equally expansive as\nthe painter\u2019s own, are captured. At\nleast, it was their personalities as\nAugustus saw them. One subject,\nW B Yeats, was somewhat less than\npleased with his portrait, saying that\nhe looked \u2018a sheer tinker, drunk-en, unpleasant and disreputable\u2019.\nOn the other hand, Gwen chose to\nfocus more on painting itself. She\nwas constantly experimenting with\nlight and was deeply troubled by\nthe question: \u2018When is a painting\ncomplete?\u2019, treating her subjects,\nmostly women, as just another part\nof a still life composition. In Gwen\u2019s\nlater works, this preoccupation with\n\u2018the painting\u2019 becomes most clear,\nthough the quick sketches she produced while travelling or just sitting\nin church do focus more on the \u2018life\u2019\nthey are capturing.\nThe early difference in style is\nparticularly evident in the Johns\u2019\nportrayals of one Dorelia McNeill,\na muse to both and the mistress of\nAugustus. Gwen depicts a quiet girl\nwith fine features; Augustus built\nher up into his dream of the wild,\nfree gypsy woman. In my opinion,\nwhat he mostly achieves is to make\nDorelia (a name he created for her)\nlook like a cheap hussy.\nI found Gwen John\u2019s work to be\nsomewhat more interesting and\nengaging, despite Augustus\u2019 good\nuse of colour (vibrant colour usually\nbeing a sure winner in my book), and\ndespite the rather mundane subject\nmatter of Gwen\u2019s paintings. You have\nto admire the woman behind them\nand her patience to create such still,\nyet captivating, images. Her style\nis quite unique \u2013 layers of careful\nbrush strokes, a very muted use of\ncolour, the three quarter length figures \u2013 while her chosen subjects are\nunremarkable, everyday scenes.\nFor those of you with an interest\nin art, I would not hesitate to recommend this exhibition, primarily as\nan exercise in viewing the developing styles of two siblings. The appalling inability of Augustus to achieve\na satisfying composition for murals\nwould also be a sobering experience\nfor any amateur artists among you.\nHowever, I would direct those\njust starting out in \u2018art appreciation\u2019 to the National Gallery and the\nRenaissance rooms instead \u2013 there\nis good use of colour, composition\nand some more engaging subject\nmatter. Also, the \u2018peep box\u2019 in one of\nthe rooms containing Dutch paintings from the era of Vermeer is quite\nentertaining.\nPaola Smith\nArts Editor\nArts arts.felix@ic.ac.uk\nVisions by Alex Holland\nFor those of you who are in search\nof the arts but have a singular aversion to travel, the Blyth Gallery\non the fifth floor of our very own\nSherfield Building is a treat. The\nbuilding itself is another matter\naltogether.\nTake the lift up to the fifth floor\n(or if you\u2019re feeling the need, go\nup the more strenuous way, feel\nfree), and you will be greeted by\nan array of photographs by Alex\nHolland and Ian Gillett. Holland\nhas titled his side of the exhibition\nLight, Direction, Reflection, while\nGillett has left such things up to the\nimagination of the viewer.\nThe subjects and feel of the works\nby the two photographers are as different as their approaches to exhibition titling. One is colourful and\nlively, while the other is somewhat\nmore contemplative and reflective.\nThe photographs submitted by\nGillett are primarily what I would\ncall fashion photos. There are\nimages of well known models gliding down the catwalk in the latest\ndesigns, as well as some of lesser\nknown models and designers. The\nvibrant atmosphere of the fashion\nshow is well captured, and throughout his models look like they are\nactually enjoying themselves.\nThe twelve photographs that\nmake up Holland\u2019s exhibition have\nbeen selected to illustrate the three\nthemes in his title \u2013 three themes he\nbelieves are central to the decision-making process in photography.\nThe photographs are a selection\nof landscapes and cityscapes. Quite\namazingly, Holland has managed\nthe impossible and actually made\nan assortment of locations around\nImperial College look interesting.\nOverall, one walks away from looking at his images in a much more\nserene mood, but also in a state\nof desperation regarding one\u2019s own\ninability to see London with the\nsame vision.\nThe exhibition runs throughout\nOctober and is completely free, so\nmake the effort and go.\nPaola Smith\n\u25cf Alex Holland writes about\nhis exhibition Light, Direction,\nReflection in Felix next week\n\u201cShe is a sort of\nmodern Vermeer\u201d\nM CHAMOT on Gwen John\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 7 October 2004 17\nGwen John and Augustus John\nTate Britain\nWorks by brother and sister in\nremarkably different styles\nTickets: \u00a35 students\nPhotography Exhibition\nAlex Holland and Ian Gillett\nBlyth Gallery, Sherfield Building\nAdmission FREE\nBritish bohemians\nArt from the Impressionist period in by a brother and sister living their own rather eccentric\nlives.

    "content": "CLUB REVIEW\nThe Fridge is a venue famed for its\nnights of dance music on the harder side, and found (as most places\noffering this kind of music are) away\nfrom central London, and south of\nthe river.\nThe kind of music you can expect\nto hear is hard house/trance and\nthe like. Music like this has taken\noff enormously over the past few\nyears, with more and more huge\n(and messy) events like Hard House\nAcademy \u2013 at Brixton\u2019s 4000-capac-ity Carling Academy \u2013 appearing.\nWhile the harder forms of music\nhave increased in popularity steadily recently, others have declined.\nWithout going too deeply into genre\npolitics, I think it\u2019s fair to say that\ntrance is one of those on the way\ndown, not just in the quality of the\nmusic being produced, but also\nthose playing it, and its reception by\nthe public and the media (Fabric\u2019s\nmusic policy specifically states \u2018no\ntrance\u2019).\nI found the smaller house room\nat Knowwhere quite pleasant \u2013 up\nfront, up to date music, and the floor\nwas reasonably full, if not packed\nout. Sadly I didn\u2019t enjoy the main\nroom half as much. Playing mostly\ntrance, the DJs didn\u2019t seem to have\nhalf the talent of those in the other\nroom.\nThe difficulty with trance music\nis that it\u2019s dense and layered, and\nto mix it well requires an ear for\nmusic as well as just a beat. Many\ntimes tonight, I was left wondering\nhow the DJs were getting away with\nit, as the mixing tended to slow me\ndown more than gee me up.\nAppearing tonight for a special\nlive PA was hard trance producer\nK90. No stranger to The Fridge, and\nreknowned in hard dance circles,\nhis squealing synth riffs took over\nthe place, and for the first time that\nevening grabbed me. Now I was\nloving it \u2013 the crowd, the lights, the\ntwisted, penetrating sounds.\nAll in all I had a pretty good night,\nthough \u00a316 is pretty pricey. You can\npay less and get a lot more out of a\nclub on a Friday (that said, they were\nselling laughing gas in balloons). It\u2019s\na shame that the Fridge has gone\nagainst their usual winning formula\nwith a night like this.\nSimon Clark\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 7 October 2004\nNIGHTLIFE clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\nIndie by invitation\nButtoned Down Disco is a soon-to-be-legendary invite only indie club.\nCatch it while you can...\n15\nCLUB REVIEW\nButtoned Down Disco is a new concept in indie clubs \u2013 invitation only.\nThe plan is to keep the general population out, and the music lovers in.\nOnce a month, you\u2019re emailed the\nlocation and you have to show up\nwith a copy of the email in your hot\nlittle hands.\nInfinity, the venue for this month\u2019s\nBDD, is a tiny two floor place.\nRoughly 250 people are crammed\ninto what is a low-ceilinged sweatbox\nof a club. The first thing you notice on\nentering the place is how friendly the\npeople are. They make space for you\nat the seriously crowded bar, chat\nwhile they\u2019re waiting for the toilets,\nand offer you a cigarette if they\u2019re\nabout to smoke one. It\u2019s so refreshing to be in an indie club where\nthere are no drunken idiots leching\nat girls, and no fighting at all.\nThe tracklisting is a little eclectic\nfor most \u2013 I\u2019d be surprised if I heard\nthe stuff the mainstream indie clubs\nare playing: the Strokes, Razorlight\netc. It\u2019s been overdone by the thousands of clubs that have sprung up\naround Tottenham Court Road over\nthe last couple of years. Instead,\nyou get tracks that veer wildly from\neighties electro classics to nineties dance to noughties punk, and\neverywhere in between. Examples\ninclude Gary Numan\u2019s Cars, The\nVelvet Underground\u2019s I\u2019m Waiting\nFor My Man and Beyonce\u2019s Crazy\nIn Love.\nUpstairs is the main dance floor,\nwhere there\u2019s not an inch of space\nthat\u2019s not covered by bodies. We were\njust standing by the bar, when the DJ\nmixed the Chemical Brothers\u2019 Hey\nBoy, Hey Girl into whatever electro\ntrack had preceded it, and the place\nwent wild. The meaty, bass-heavy\nsoundsystem is pointed right at the\ndancefloor and is one of the best I\u2019ve\nheard.\nDownstairs, the atmosphere is\nmuch more chilled. I spent an hour\ndown there, and heard mostly downbeat reggae, soul and the occasional\nbit of house. The volume is lower, so\nit\u2019s easy to talk and wander around\nrandom people.\nBecause the atmosphere is so\nmuch friendlier, the door staff are\nless rough and more accommodat-ing. The heat is fairly intense, and\nthere was no problem with me nipping out to get a bit of fresh air for\nten minutes \u2013 I walked around the\nblock and came back, and they let\nme straight back in without any has-sle.\nI\u2019d only been once before tonight,\nand that was about six months ago.\nThat was easily one of the best\nnights I\u2019ve ever had, and this time\nit was almost as good. As far as\nindie clubs go, this one is a league\napart. The invitation-only idea keeps\nthe same people coming back, the\nmusic is diverse and eclectic, and\nthe atmosphere is incredibly friend-ly. I almost don\u2019t want to spread the\nword, because it\u2019s so great already,\nbut you really need to try this place\nif you\u2019re tired of the Mean Fiddler,\nthe Metro, and all the other copycat\nvenues running the same kind of\nindie nights.\nAndrew Sykes\nKnowwhere\nThe Fridge, Town Hall Parade, Brixton\n\u00a310\u2013\u00a316\nHHIII\nKnowwhere\n(not here!)\nButtoned Down Disco\nInfinity, Old Burlington Street\n\u00a34/free with email flyer\nHHHHH\nHello and welcome to the second\nof this year\u2019s Nightlife sections. My\naim over the coming year is to equip\nyou with as much knowledge of the\nLondon club scene as possible, and\nhopefully encourage you to go out\nand experience some of it yourself.\nI\u2019m sure you don\u2019t need to be told,\nbut London is the best place in the\nworld for a lot of things, and clubbing\nis certainly one of them. When I talk\nabout clubbing, I have to confess I\nhave a slightly blinkered view. To\nme, a club is a place where people\ngo to dance. There are a lot of places\nwith dancefloors, big soundsystems\nand lightshows, and even halfway\ncompetent DJs, but if everyone is\nthere just to get pissed on \u00a31-a-shot\nvodka, I really don\u2019t see the point.\nFor me, clubs exist first and foremost to play pumping music that will\nmake you want to dance all night,\nand all night in this case means until\nthe next morning (usually around\nthe time the tube opens at week-ends). The existence of these places\nis a real breath of fresh air, especially\nwhen all you\u2019re used to is \u2018clubs\u2019 full\nof underage kids getting as drunk\nas they can as cheaply as possible,\nand men trying to pull drunk girls.\nI\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t like cheap\nbeer \u2013 god forbid, but what I am\nsaying is that there are different\nnights out to be had depending on\nwhat you expect. Go clubbing and\nyou might just be refreshed at the\namount of intelligent conversation\nto be had, and the lack of hassle\nfrom members of the opposite sex.\nEither way, choose an event that\nsuits your taste, and you will not be\ndisappointed by the music.\nAlso refreshing is the general lack\nof dress codes at clubs across the\ncity. Some places insist on silly rules\nlike forcing you to wear shoes (not\ngreat for dancing in) or not allowing jeans, but in London you\u2019ll very\nrarely find this a problem.\nIn terms of the different styles of\nmusic on offer, you can more or less\ntake your pick. The secret is knowing\nwhere to look. The club scene really\ncovers everything, with indie clubs as\nwell as the usual offerings of hip-hop,\nR&B and soul, right through house\n(in all its forms), garage, breakbeat,\ntrance, drum and bass, jungle, and\nright up to happy hardcore for the\nnutters amongst you, plus anything\nI forgot in between.\nThere are hundreds of establishments all over London willing to take\nyour hard-borrowed cash, and some\nare nowhere near the standard of\nothers. Prices start from nothing\nand go up to \u00a320 at some of the more\nclassy venues like Pacha, or even\nhigher for special big events. Don\u2019t\ngo to places just because of the price\ntag though, as there are many hidden gems around that you won\u2019t\neven have to pay for (see our review\nof Buttoned Down Disco, above). It\ncan be advisable to acquire tickets\nfor a given night in advance. Most of\nthe big clubs now offer some form of\ncredit card booking system, and it\u2019s\na lot nicer to pick up your tickets and\nwalk straight through the doors than\nqueue for hours and still not get in.\nLondon attracts a lot of big name\nDJs, and whilst the really huge\nnames (Sasha, Digweed, Oakenfold)\nspend most of their time out of this\ncountry, they all stop back regularly\nto pack out the clubs. A lot of the DJs\nhere are mostly known for the nights\nthey play at, with real cult followings.\nThere is also a lot of up and coming\ntalent to be seen if you keep your\neyes and ears open.\nThe best way to find out what\u2019s\non is to start going out. When you\nleave a club, you\u2019ll be accosted by\npeople handing out flyers, usually\nin big bundles, for upcoming events\nin town, with the type of club you\u2019re\nleaving directly related to the flyers\nyou receive. As well as that, you can\nkeep up to date with the features,\nreviews and listings found in Felix.\nThe web is also a fantastic source of\ninformation \u2013 all the big clubs have\ntheir own sites.\nThe key to finding clubs you like\nis experimentation. You have to give\nthings a try, and with the world\u2019s\nbest night out possibly ahead of you,\nwho can resist?\nOne of my favourite things about\nclubbing is the afterparties. Dancing\nthrough until six, seven or eight\nin the morning might seem mad\nenough, but consider that there are\nalso special events laid on to start\nas these nights are finishing. While I\ndoubt that very many people get up\nextra early on a Saturday to go and\nget in amongst the sweaty ravers, if\nyou\u2019re already out then your sleep\npatterns are already screwed, so\nwhy the hell not? Afterparties generally cost less than the nights preceding them, and can carry on well into\nthe next evening. The crowds are\noften more fun, and tend to be in a\nbit of a state since they haven\u2019t been\nhome yet. Once you start going to\nevents like these, you\u2019ll realise there\nis a real sub-culture associated with\nclubbing.\nThe people you find are another\njoy of the club scene. While at certain places you may visit there will\nbe many overtly drunk people, often\nwith drunken senses of humour and\ntaste, you\u2019ll find most people you\nmeet in clubs to be friendly and kind.\nPeople share water, gum, cigarettes\nand lots and lots of big grins. If you\nbump into someone, or they bump\ninto you, they\u2019ll turn and apologise.\nIt\u2019s very easy to start conversations,\nand once you\u2019ve started it can be all\ntoo easy to tell absolute strangers\nyour whole life story.\nClubbing gives you an opportunity to make friends like no other.\nMy closest friends have generally\nbeen my clubbing friends, and this\nis partly because you spend so much\ntime together. Six to eight hours\ninside a club, plus a couple before\nand after, is probably more than you\nspend with your mates on a normal\nnight out. You also develop great\ntrust \u2013 when you\u2019re looking after one\nanother on mad little missions round\nthe city, it comes pretty quickly.\nSo there you go \u2013 all the reasons\nanyone could ever need to go club-bing, or at least to give it a try.\nIfyou\u2019vemadeitthisfarandarestill\ninterested, or if I\u2019ve been preaching\nto the converted, then you\u2019re in luck.\nOur Nightlife section doesn\u2019t write\nitself, and you may have noticed that\nall of last week\u2019s edition, and most\nof this week\u2019s, were written by little\nold me. If you think you could write\na review of a club, or have any comments or experiences (good or bad)\nto do with London clubbing then we\nwant to hear from you!\nFelix needs reviewers to keep its\nvarious sections up to date, and this\ncould be you. You don\u2019t need any\nexperience at all, and the best part\nis you get to go free! Promoters like\nto give us free CDs, gig tickets and\nguestlist places, so that we can then\nreview them.\nI love this \u2013 I get to go to all my\nfavourite late night hangouts, it\u2019s\nfree, I get to skip the queue and look\nall cool saying \u201cmy name\u2019s on the\nlist\u201d, and all I have to do is write a little bit about the night I had in return.\nSimple, right?\nIf you\u2019d like to write for us and go\nclubbing for free (and this can save\nyou a lot when you consider you get\nyour entry plus a friend\u2019s for) then\nemail me at clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk, or\ndrop into the Felix office any time.\nSIMON CLARK\nNIGHTLIFE EDITOR\nA fridge: not that we\u2019re running\nout of ideas or anything\nJoin the club\nWhy you really should give London clubbing a try...\n\u201cThe people you find\nare another joy of\nthe club scene\u201d\n\n"

If this is the case, you may\nwell be loving the freedom that coming to university gives you, however\nsome of you might be feeling the\ntotal opposite.\nYou may be feeling lonely, finding\nit hard to settle in the local area\nand just feeling generally unhappy.\nIf you are feeling like this, you may\nwell be homesick.\nThere are many causes of home-sickness, including:\n\u25cf the distance away from home\n\u25cf things not being what you expect-ed, in your course or the local area.\n\u25cf heavy workload\n\u25cf a feeling of anticlimax \u2013 perhaps\ncoming to university wasn\u2019t as good\nan experience as you thought.\nIf you are feeling like this, there\nare ways to get over it and there are\npeople out there who can help you.\nIt might help to talk things through\nwith someone you trust \u2013 this could\nbe a personal tutor, a friend, a coun-sellor, a chaplain, a member of your\nfamily or a student adviser.\nAnother way of combating homesickness is to make a real effort to\njoin societies and activities. This is\na great way of meeting new people\nand may help you to feel less home-sick. To find out more about student\nactivities, please contact casa@ic.\nac.uk.\nTry to establish a routine during\nyour time here \u2013 the more time you\nspend doing things, the less time\nyou spend thinking about home.\nGive yourself a bit of time to get\nthrough it. Sometimes people make\na rash decision to leave university\nand then regret it afterwards. When\nI first went to college, I hated it, but\nI said that I would give it six weeks\nand ended up having the best years\nof my life so far.\nBe realistic about what to expect\nfrom your time at university \u2013 there\nwill obviously be good and bad\ntimes.\nIf you still feel down and upset\neven after trying to resolve these\nissues then you should seek help\nfrom a professional. The College\nprovides a free counselling service\nand of course there is the Union\nAdvice Service which can also help.\nIf you would like further information or have any questions about\nhomesickness or any other topic,\nplease contact the Imperial College\nUnion Advice Service on 020 7594\n8067 or advice@ic.ac.uk.\nADVICE SERVICE\nNIGEL COOKE\nUNION ADVISER\nHopefully you have all (almost) survived Freshers Week. You\u2019ll therefore be starting to get an appreciation for what Imperial College is\nlike, the unique culture of this institution and it\u2019s vibrant student body\n(demonstrated so magnificently at\nthe Freshers Fair).\nI\u2019m on the radio\nStarting tonight (Thursday) is the\nfirst weekly Fireside show at 6pm\non IC Radio.\nWhat\u2019s IC Radio? It\u2019s your award-winning student radio station, at\nwww.icradio.com. Imperial College\nUnion plays host to some of the\nmost dynamic media societies\nthanks to our state of the art Media\nCentre.\nAnyway, the Fireside show will feature the Felix editor and myself live\non air. We\u2019ll start with a Presidential\naddress on the week\u2019s big stories\n(generally the Felix front page), and\nthen it\u2019ll be your chance to phone\nin and ask questions. Ask anything\nyou like. The future of fox hunting\nat Wye, the legality of that obscure\nsociety you find offensive, my views\non euthanasia, what underwear I\u2019m\nwearing... the possibilities are end-less!\nElections: STAND\nYou will have noticed, I hope, that\nelections are happening and there\nare plenty of representative positions to stand for, especially for\npostgraduates. Please do consider\nstanding for election if you think you\ncan represent your peers.\nRepresentation is important. It\u2019s\nultimately the most important reason for the Union to exist. Students\ncome to College first and foremost\nto have a good education (in all\naspects, such as extra-curricular,\nnot just on their degree course).\nThe job of the Union is to ensure\nthat the College delivers on this\ncommitment and also to ensure that\nprovision is improved for the future\nwhen decisions are being made by\nCollege authorities.\nThe College is going through\na period of change. Most of the\nsenior academic leadership of the\nCollege (Pro Rectors and Faculty\nPrincipals) are new, and they will\nwant to leave their mark in a big way.\nThis year, the College is also going\nthrough a an educational quality\naudit from the Quality Assurance\nAgency (QAA), who are responsible\nfor ensuring that teaching quality is\nmaintained. The QAA will, as part\nof their audit, solicit a submission\nfrom the Union. Ultimately many\nchanges, if they improve things, can\nbe beneficial to students, and the\nUnion can play a very positive part\nin the change process.\nFor students to benefit, however,\nthe Union must be representative\n\u2013 that is to say that the views it\nvoices must genuinely reflect the\ngrass roots views of the students.\nThe only way that can happen is if\na sufficiently large proportion of the\nstudent body participates in the voting process.\nAnyway, enough of my inane\nramblings. Go to www.union.ic.ac.\nuk/elections. Now. Please. Pretty\nplease. With a cherry on top.\nDoughnuts\nRegular readers will recall that last\nyear I wrote about the best places\nto purchase doughnuts. Those with\nbetter memories will remember\nthat I suggested Tesco as the best\nvalue place to go. Following further\ndoughnut investigations, I would\nlike to confirm that I no longer\nconsider this a sensible option. I\nno longer feel that guzzling down\na pack of 10 doughnuts in one go is\nsensible.\nQuality is surely more important than quantity. To that end, the\ndairy cream filled chocolate coated\ndoughnuts at Miss Ellie\u2019s in South\nKensington station come highly rec-ommended. But if you really want\nto treat yourself, go to the Harrods\nFood Hall (only for special occa-sions, but you do get to \u2018try\u2019 one for\nfree if you say that you haven\u2019t had\none before!) Don\u2019t forget the milk\nshake.\nFinally...\nThe Union is here to serve you. I\nknow I wrote this last week, but\nit\u2019s worth saying again. If you think\nthere is something we are doing\nwrong or have ideas for things we\ncould do better, please do not hesitate to get in touch. My office is on\nthe first floor of the Union Building\nand I\u2019m always happy to make time\nto see students, as are the rest of\nthe team.\nSo, the European Social Forum\n(ESF) is coming to London. But\nwhat actually is the ESF, and why\nshould we, as students of Imperial\nCollege, care? Well, that is what I\nam going to try to explain, as well as\nwhy I believe it is important for as\nmany students as possible to attend\nthe event, which is being held in\nAlexandra Palace and Bloomsbury\non 15\u201317 October.\nThe ESF is described as \u2018the largest gathering in British history\u2019\n\u2013 tens of thousands of people, from\nevery background imaginable, will\nbe gathering in London under the\nphrase \u2018Another World is Possible\u2019,\nto debate and discuss how to get\nthere. It will be focused around\nsix major themes: war and peace;\ndemocracy and fundamental rights;\nsocial justice and solidarity; corporate globalisation and global justice;\nagainst racism, discrimination and\nthe far right; environmental crisis\nand a sustainable planet.\nTheeventwillseenon-governmental organisations, religious groups,\nsocialists, environmentalists, trade\nunionists, anti-capitalists and many\nother groups ending with \u2018-ists\u2019 coming together for a festival for global\njustice for all. Speakers include Dr\nAleida Guevara (Che\u2019s daughter),\nMuslim writer Tariq Ramadan, third\nworld debt expert Susan George,\nand many others including John\nPilger and Tony Benn. But the ESF\nisn\u2019t just about meetings. The event\nwill also feature film showings, such\nas those introduced by Ken Loach,\nand music, with a huge anti-fascist\nconcert one evening. On the final\nday, there will be a massive international anti-war demonstration, ending in Trafalgar Square with former\nAlgerian president and anti-colonial\nresistance leader Ahmed Ben Bella\nintroducing the classic film Battle of\nAlgiers, with a new score performed\nby Asian Dub Foundation.\nTwo years ago, when the ESF was\nheld in Florence, Italy, the Italian\nuniversities were forced to close\ndue to the vast numbers of students\nattending the event. The scale of\nthe ESF is clearly huge, and we\nare very privileged to have it right\nhere on our doorstep. No doubt the\nsize of the ESF will soon become\napparent, with some of our clubs\nand societies getting involved in\npromoting it.\nI am a great believer in the idea\nthat Imperial College Union should\nnot isolate itself from the \u2018real\nworld\u2019 out there, and in no area is\nthis more important than in wel-fare. Every welfare issue we face in\nCollege will be rooted or mirrored\nin the wider world. And the more\nof us that attend the ESF and take\npart in debates on welfare issues\non a global scale, the more we will\nbe united and prepared to tackle\nwelfare issues on campus, whether\nthey be the individual and personal\nproblems that any one of us may\nface, or the ongoing fights against\ntop-up fees and increases in hall\nrents.\nAnother world is possible. Let\u2019s\nstart to find out how.\nTo register for the ESF or to find\nout more, visit www.fse-esf.org.\n\u25cf Colin Smith is the Welfare\nCampaigns Officer of Imperial\nCollege Union. He works with the\nDeputy President (Education and\nWelfare) in researching and organising campaigns and awareness\nevents. If you have any comments\nor questions, or would like to contact Colin about the ESF or any\nother welfare-related concerns, he\nwould be happy to hear from you at\ncs602@ic.ac.uk.\nCOLIN SMITH\nWELFARE CAMPAIGNS\nOFFICER\nMUSTAFA ARIF\nUNION PRESIDENT\nSTATE OF\nTHE UNION\n\n"

    "content": "By Darius Nikbin\nLast week, the world\u2019s most\npre-eminent laboratory for the\nstudy of particle physics celebrated its 50th birthday. CERN,\noften dubbed the \u2018Mecca of\nphysics\u2019 has during the last\nfive decades been a shining\nexample of scientific progress\nthrough \u2018big science\u2019 and international collaboration.\nIn1954,whenCERN(Conseil\nEurop\u00e9en pour la Recherche\nNucl\u00e9aire)wasestablished,the\nworld was still in shock from\nthe awesome power unleashed\nby the bombing of Hiroshima\nand Nagasaki. Understanding\nthe inner workings of the atom\nbecame a priority for Europe,\nand CERN became a symbol\nof post-war scientific collabo-ration.\nIt was not until 1984, when\nEurope beat the US to the\nground breaking discovery of\nthe W and Z particles of the\nweak interaction, that CERN\ngradually became recognised\nas the world\u2019s premier particle\nphysics research facilty.\nEurope is currently building the Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC) at CERN. It\u2019s opening\nin 2007 will be another landmark in CERN\u2019s history.\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 7 October 2004\nSCIENCE science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nPlants\u2019 role in global warming reevaluated\nNew research suggests that the planet\u2019s ability to adapt to rising carbon dioxide\nlevels with help from plants may have been overestimated\n5\nBy James Berry\nBiochemistry department\nIn the week that the Kyoto\nprotocol was finally ratified,\nmore worrying research on\nthe planet\u2019s ability to adapt\nto its rising atmospheric\ncarbon levels has been pub-lished.\nIt seems that the international efforts to cap escalating carbon dioxide emissions\nhave come about just in time.\nOptimistic sceptics of global\nwarming, who believe that\nplants will proportionally\nincrease their carbon influx\nin response to our carbon\nefflux, have just been com-promised. Proposals to alleviate climate change by creating forests, where boosted\ngrowth is stimulated by an\nenriched atmosphere, seem\nless sure.\nResearchers from McGill\nUniversity, Montreal have\nstudied [1] the responses of\nseveral growth lines of the\nalga Chlamydomonas rein-hardtii grown under ambient and elevated CO2 con-centrations, to high doses\nof CO2. The cells\u2019 cultures\nwere grown for around\n1000 generations in liquid\nculture in concentrations\nthat reflect current and\nforecasted CO2 levels. The\ncells were then tested for\nphotosynthetic capacity and\nlimiting density as indicators of growth.

    "content": "INTERVIEWS\nThis year\u2019s Music Of Black Origin\n(MOBO) Awards had been rife with\nproblems from the outset. The gay\nrights group OutRage accused the\norganisers of supporting homophobic artists Elephant Man and Vybz\nKartel. The two Jamaican reggae\nstars were later dropped from the\nnominations, partly due to their lyrics inciting homophobia, but mainly\nbecause of their refusal to apologise\nfor them. This, however, upset the\nBlack Music Council, who protested\non the night, waving banners in the\nair reading \u201cDefend Reggae Music\u201d\nand \u201cEnraged by OutRage!\u201d. They\nalso booed celebrities and incessantly chanted to the beat of the\nbongos. This didn\u2019t seem to dampen\nthe spirits of the stars, though.\nThe other major upset at the\nawards was the number of American\nurban artists who dropped out from\nappearing. Most notably among\nthese was Pharrell Williams, from\nN*E*R*D and The Neptunes,\nwho had been down to host the\nawards. Rap artist and actor Mos\nDef stepped in at the last minute\nto take his place. Others who had\nbeen scheduled to appear but\ndidn\u2019t show up included Beyonc\u00e9,\nChristina Milian, Usher and man\nof the moment Kanye West, who\nreceived a record seven nominations this year.\nSomehow on the night I managed\nto get into the press area, loaded\nwith recording equipment for IC\nRadio, standing right beside the red\ncarpet awaiting the stars\u2019 arrival.\nEventually they did turn up to the\nAwards, despite all of the above set\nbacks. Among those who came were\nOlympic champion Kelly Holmes,\nCaroline Chikezie (who plays Sasha\nin T4\u2019s As If), Lulu, Myleen Klass,\nFearne Cotton and Reggie from Top\nof the Pops and, of course, Tara\nPalmer-Tompkinson as well as a\nwhole host of minor celebrities who\nI and many of the other press people failed to recognise. I managed\nto chat to a few of the nominated\nartists.\nFirst up was Estelle, London\u2019s\nfeisty new queen of hip-hop. She\u2019d\nalready grabbed the urban scene\u2019s\nattention with 1980 in July and was a\nhotly tipped favourite to win the Best\nBritish Newcomer award, which she\nlater scooped that night. I asked\nher who she was most looking forward to see perform, to which she\npromptly replied \u201cMary J Blige\u201d,\nAmerica\u2019s long running queen of\nRnB. \u201cI saw her doing rehearsals\nearlier and she was\u2026 hot.\u201d Estelle\nalso mentioned her new single Free,\nwhich is out this week and features previous MOBO winner Miss\nDynamite in the video.\nA relative newcomer to the\nBritish-Asian music scene, Raghav\nwas up for Best Collaboration, with\n2Play for the chart-topping single So\nConfused against the likes of Brandy\nfeaturing Kanye West, Usher featuring Lil John & Ludacris, Twista\nfeaturing Kanye West & Jamie Foxx\nand Marques Houston featuring\nJoe Budden & Pied Piper. Raghav\nseemed very enthused about being\nat the award ceremony but was not\nconfident about winning: \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow. All the other guys are much\nmore well-known and easier to say\nthan me.\u201d But against all the odds,\nhe did win the award. Raghav also\ntold me that he\u2019s currently working hard on promoting his current\nalbum Storyteller, which came out\nearly last month, and that the next\nsingle to be taken from it is a \u201creally\nlovely track\u201d.\nAlso at the awards, nominated\nin the Best Jazz category, was\npint-sized Jamie Cullum. I asked\nhim if he had considered filling in\nPharrell\u2019s shoes to host the awards,\nsince he\u2019d covered Pharrell\u2019s only\nsolo single Frontin\u2019. Jamie jokingly\nreplied: \u201cNo man can fill his shoes\u2026\nnot me. He\u2019s a size nine.\u201d Jamie\nalso let slip that he was \u201creally\nhungry. I haven\u2019t eaten anything, so\nI\u2019ll be looking to eat and drink a lot\ntonight\u201d. On that note I wished him\ngood luck. Later in the evening, he\npicked up the award for Best Jazz,\ndefeating the likes of Norah Jones\nand Amy Winehouse.\nFlying the flag for the US were\nBrandy and Janet Jackson. Janet\ndidn\u2019t do any interviews but later\npresented Anita Baker with her\nlifetime achievement award. Mario\nWinans also showed up, though he\nwas unaware that I Don\u2019t Wanna\nKnow had been nominated for\nBest Ringtone, which he later won.\nNeither did he know how successful\nthat single was over here. \u201cPeople\nshould tell me these things,\u201d he said.\nWhen asked about all the big names\nthat dropped out, he defended his\nfellow Americans, stating that these\nthings happen all the time at award\nceremonies due to scheduling and\nbusy workloads. This was also the\nopinion of Lemar, who was up for\ntwo awards but sadly didn\u2019t receive\nany. He was keen to mention his\nnew single and album, both of which\nare coming out in November.\nNot all the artists who came along\nto the MOBO Awards were nominat-ed. I spoke to Rishi Rich, a British\nproducer who has worked with the\nlikes of Britney Spears, Craig David,\nMary J Blige and Liberty X as well as\nbeing part of the Rishi Rich Project,\nwho brought us Eyes On You this\nsummer and features rapper Jay\nSean. Rishi talked to me about his\nupcoming album as well as working\non Jay Sean\u2019s album, both of which\nhe\u2019s looking forward to. In response\nto many of the American artists not\nshowing up, he said: \u201cYeah, I think\nthat could help some of our British\nartists get exposure tonight.\u201d\nQuite a few British breakthrough\nartists were hoping for that as well.\nThese included Nina Jayne, who\nhad previously won the MOBO\nUnSung award in 2001 under the\nguise of N\u2019Jay. The UnSung competition tries to find and recognise\nnew urban talent in the UK by\ntouring the country. Nina has now\nsigned to BMG and was very much\nlooking forward to her debut album\ngetting released. Another new artist\nI spoke to at the awards was Rhian\nBenson, whose debut single Say\nHow I Feel is out this week. Rhian\u2019s\nmusic is inspired by soul, reggae,\nearly Stevie Wonder and her roots in\nGhana. She was extremely excited\nat being at her first MOBO awards.\nThe star of the night, though, was\nJamelia. As soon as she arrived,\nBrandy rushed over to her and\nthey started joking with each other.\nJamelia won all three of the awards\nshe was nominated for, sharing UK\nAct of the Year award with Dizzee\nRascal. This year has been particularly successful for the 23-year-old,\nfollowing her comeback to the music\nindustry after putting her career on\nhold for her daughter Teja, now\nthree. Jamelia\u2019s next single to be\ntaken from her muti-platinum selling album Thank You is a track\ncalled DJ, out on 1 November.\nMartin Archer\nThe MOBO Awards 2004\nAccusations of homophobia, racism, and American stars that didn\u2019t show up \u2013\nFelix reports from beside the red carpet\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 7 October 2004\n12\nMusic music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nThe MOBO Awards\nRoyal Albert Hall\n30 September\nMetal-loving hamsters on drugs\nALBUM REVIEW\nImagine for a moment, if you will, a\nhamster on a cocktail of metham-phetamine, benzphetamine, phen-termine, fenfluramine, mazindol,\nketamine, phendimetrazine, crack\ncocaine, methcathinone and meth-ylphenidate.

Got that?\nWell, you\u2019re still nowhere near\nEspecially Likely Sloth, yet that is the\nbest I can do to describe the group\u2019s\nsound. This is a project of Jason\nWilliam Walton, otherwise known for\nhis work with folk/extreme metal\nbands Agalloch and Sculptured. The\nmusic, however, is truly deranged\nelectronica. In my experience But\nIf What He\u2019ll What Ant has one of\ntwo effects on the listener. The first\n(which I fall victim to) is to sit, grin\nmanically, and start doing everything at twice the speed while trying to squeak along. The friends I\nplayed it to, however, threatened to\nscratch off their ears if I didn\u2019t turn\nit off, calling it disturbing, scary and\ngenerally too weird.\nAs such, this release is very\nmuch an acquired taste. The\nmusic revolves around insanely\ncatchy melodies played on game-console sounding keyboards, with\nan abundance of Simpsons samples and extremely high-pitched\nvocals. Some more organic-sound-ing strings fit surprisingly well, as\ndo their disharmonies. Occasional\ncalypso-sounding sections help create an even more mind-expanding\nlisten, and tinny drums complete the\nexperience. Crystal clear production makes every bizarre note and\nnuance of the music unavoidable\n(for those still naively attempting to\ncling to their sanity by trying not to\nlisten).\nBut If What He\u2019ll What Ant comes\nhighly recommended to fans of truly\noff-kilter music, but is perhaps one\nto avoid for less adventurous listen-ers. Oh, and it\u2019s also more addictive\n\u2013 I would imagine \u2013 than metham-phetamine, benzphetamine, phen-termine, fenfluramine, mazindol,\nketamine, phendimetrazine, crack\ncocaine, methcathinone and methylphenidate put together.\nRussell Garwood\nEspecially Likely Sloth\nBut If What He\u2019ll What Ant\n(Vendlus Records)\nHHHII\n\u201cWho\u2019s this guy?\u201d Pharrell Williams (left) with Jamie Cullum\nMary J Blige: the undisputed queen of R\u2019n\u2019B\n\n"

    "content": "CLUB REVIEW\nLayo & Bushwacka (aka Layo\nPaskin and Matt \u2018Bushwacka\u2019 B)\nare a formidable duo on the club\nscene. They\u2019ve both been involved\nsince the early days, and as a production duo since the mid-nineties.\nLayo is co-founder of The End with\nMr C, and the pair met through him,\nso this place is like their home.\nThe monthly residency, All Night\nLong (also the name of a brilliant\ndouble mix CD by the pair), is one\nof the finest nights out in town and\nhas a firm following. This really\nisn\u2019t surprising when you consider\nthe club\u2019s reputation, plus the fact\nthat tonight both the lounge and the\nmain room are as one, filled with the\nsounds of Layo & Bushwacka for\neight hours straight, right through\nthe night. To add to the fun, this\nwas the first time they\u2019d been back\nat The End since the summer, their\nlast event being the All Night Long\nboat party \u2013 a club night on the\nThames!\nEntering via the attached AKA\nbar, where Sancho Panza were\nalready rocking with a selection of\ndirty disco house, I descended into\nthe club to find, as you\u2019d expect,\nthe place already heaving with rev-ellers. Describing the people you\nfind here is tricky, as there\u2019s always\nquite a variety, but mostly everyone\nis clued up, sexy and stylish. Moving\nstraight onto the dancefloor, I found\nthe music to be much the same.\nLayo & Bushwacka play all sorts\nof music, under the banner of house.\nTo the point and funky, their style\nis always tight and crisp. Taking\nin breakbeat tracks as well as 4x4\nstuff, their mixes move through different vibes confidently and proudly.\nThis is DJing with none of the bullshit \u2013 they don\u2019t rely on popular, big\nrecords to build the crowd, instead\nshowing off their prowess by showcasing the hottest new tunes along\nwith their proven classics.\nIt\u2019s easy to tell when a DJ is good\n\u2013 just check out the crowd. Looking\naround The End, you realise just\nhow good Layo and Bushwacka\nare, as people are strutting their\nstuff all over. Admittedly you might\nfind the dancing here slightly more\nrestrained and conservative than\nat other places around the city, but\neveryone here knows how to give\nit some.\nHappy, dancing people means\nfriendly people \u2013 there\u2019s no attitude here, and you\u2019re quite likely to\nstrike up conversations with total\nstrangers just because you bumped\ninto each other on the dancefloor.\nSpend some time chatting and you\u2019ll\nfind all kinds of people from all\nwalks of life.\nWith the music captivating me,\nand being egged on by the up-for-it\ncrowd, the dancefloor was where I\nstayed for most of the night. When\nyou spend a lot of time on dance-floors, one of the things you notice a\nlot more is decor. The End is up with\nthe best in this respect too. The ceilings are draped with thin webbing\nto pick up the impressive lightshow,\ncreating a stylish blend of reds and\npurples, a chic which suits the cli-entele. One of the high points of the\nnight was an inspired mix of Minnie\nRiperton\u2019s Loving You. It may seem\na bit odd, but I can tell you that it\nworked a treat, bringing the dancefloor to a standstill and prompting\neveryone to sing along.\nOverall, All Night Long was as\ngood as it always is \u2013 down to earth,\nlike-minded people, and down to\nearth, solid, funky music.\nSimon Clark\nRAVE REVIEW\nThe history of dance music in the\nUK is long, dating back to the mid-eighties when electronic instruments and the new-found desire to\ndance until dawn combined, resulting in one of the most creative and\nexciting times in British music.\nRaindance has been around\nalmost as long as dance music itself\n\u2013 it was the first fully licensed all\nnight event in the UK, at a time\nwhen illegal raves were the place to\nbe, and club culture as we know it\ndidn\u2019t exist.\nNow, 15 years on, Raindance is still\ngoing strong, holding four events\nper year. These usually take place in\nLondon, and recently Raindance has\nfound it\u2019s home at seOne. Previously\nknown as SE1, and before that The\nDrome, seOne is situated in the\ntunnels underneath London Bridge\nStation. This makes for a fantastic\nvenue with a genuine underground\nfeel. Each room (or \u2018arch\u2019) is made\nby dividing the brick tunnels, giving\nthe place a sense of closeness and\nintimacy, whilst making it very easy\nto get lost and discover a room you\nhaven\u2019t been into yet at 4am. seOne\nis not a small place, however, with a\ncapacity of around 3000 (the same\nas superclub Fabric). Some people\nused to complain that The Drome\nwas no more than an \u201coverpriced\nsquat\u201d, but the current management have done a lot to improve the\nplace \u2013 the walls are painted and\nthe bare concrete floors have been\ngiven a new foot-friendly surface.\nApproaching the venue, it was\nclear that this was going to be a\nsell-out. Luckily we acquired tickets\nbeforehand \u2013 a lot of people were\nturned away at the door \u2013 though we\nstill had to queue for quite a while\nto pick our tickets up, then again\nto get in, and once more for the\ncloakroom. By 1am we were ready\nto explore and made our way around\nthe arches.\nWith the history that goes with\nRaindance, so the music policy covers the past 15 years of dance music.\nThe Jenkins Lane (where the first\nRaindance was held) Reunion arch\nplays host to the oldest and slowest\nmusic. This is house in its embryonic form \u2013 sparse synthesisers\nand drum machines with sampled\ndrum breaks and stolen vocals. Just\nbecause it\u2019s old and relatively slow\nwhen compared to modern dance\nmusic doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not good.\nThis kind of music always has passion and sounds great: chunky\nbasslines, resonating piano melodies and jingling, perpetual percus-sion.\nMoving on, we found that the\nnext (and the biggest) arch was\nthe main Old Skool arch. Here, the\nmusic is taken from the next point\nin dance\u2019s evolution. This is faster\nand harder than before. The beats\nare more pounding, the sounds and\nsamples crazier, and the breaks\nmore euphoric. The emphasis with\nthis kind of music is on making\npeople dance fast and hard, then\nscream and reach for the lasers\nin the breakdowns. No matter how\nold it is, this kind of hardcore still\nsounds fresh, original and banging\nto the objective ear.\nNext, on to the third arch: Jungle\nand Drum & Bass. A lot of drum &\nbass events around London come\nwith a whole lot of attitude includ-ed, but just because the music is\ndark and ominous doesn\u2019t mean the\ncrowd have to be. At Raindance, the\nJungle and D&B room proved this \u2013\nhappy people, moving like mad and\nmaking all the noise they can with\ntheir mouths, horns and whistles.\nThe fourth and final arch was\nthe fastest and most extreme: the\nHardcore arch. This is really quite\ninsane music \u2013 think of the standard\ncheesy dance crap you hear on the\nradio, then speed it up by half as\nmuch again. Relentless rhythms at\nbreakneck speed, squeaky vocals,\nsparkling pianos and twisted\nbasslines all come together to make\na wall of sound that is unmatched in\nits intensity and energy. Needless to\nsay, the Hardcore Arch was by far\nthe hottest and sweatiest, and the\ncrowd here were moving a lot more\nthan in any of the other arches.\nAs the night rolled on, I hardly\nnoticed the time passing. Legendary\nDJ Kevin Energy (part of the NuNRG producer collective/record\nlabel) absolutely destroyed the\nHardcore arch, with his freeform\nstyle encompassing happy hardcore,\njungle, drum and bass, gabba and\nanything hard, energetic and fast.\nWhen I say destroy, I really mean\nit \u2013 people were hugging speakers,\nscreaming, and moving so fast that\nthe sweat was literally flying.\nAll the arches at Raindance have\nMCs. Whether this is a good or bad\nthing is a question of taste; the main\nOld Skool arch was advertised as\n\u201875% MC free\u2019. Personally I do enjoy\nsome MCing, but sometimes, and\nwith less vocally dextrous artists, it\ncan become slightly annoying. Not\nhere, though \u2013 everyone I heard on\nthe mic had enough skill to rouse the\ncrowd without spoiling the tunes.\nWith much bouncing in and\nbetween the arches, the rest of the\nnight passed with the usual profusion of random exchanges with even\nmore random people (you tend to\nmeet some very interesting ones\nat events like these), 8am rolled\naround soon enough, and I was left\nwanting more. The afterparty, in yet\nmore arches, continued until 1pm.\nSimon Clark\n\u25cf Keep your eyes on the listings\nsection for details of the next Raindance event.\nClubbing All Night Long\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 7 October 2004\n14\nRaindance 15th Birthday\nseOne, Weston Street\nHHHHI\nNightlife clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\nLayo & Bushwacka: DJing with none of the bullshit\nRelive the days of rave.

    "content": "By Darius Nikbin\nScience Editor\nIn less than a month, America\ngoes to the polls to choose\nbetween John Kerry and\nGeorge W Bush. So far, most\nof what we have heard from\nthe candidates seems to\nrevolve around the situation\nin Iraq and the \u2018war on terror\u2019. Domestic issues seem\nless important than the candidates\u2019 Vietnam war records.\nWe have not, however, heard\nmuch from the candidates in\nthe run-up to these elections\non the really divisive issues.\nScience policy is one of these.\nIn February this year, 60\nof America\u2019s leading scien-tists, including Nobel laure-ates, medical experts, former\nfederal agency directors and\nuniversity chairs, voiced\ntheir concern at the misuse of science by the Bush\nadministration. In the months\nsince this report, presented\nby the Union of Concerned\nScientists (UCS), 5000 scientists have signed in support\nof the document, which was\nentitled Restoring Scientific\nIntegrity in Policy Making.\nThe scientists accuse the\nBush administration of fiddling findings to suit their\npolitical agenda. According to\nthe UCS, the administration\nhad misrepresented the findings of the National Academy\nof Sciences and other experts\non climate change to suit\nthemselves.\nFurthermore, in April\u2019s\nissue of Scientific American,\nthe editorial compared the\nBush administration\u2019s attitude towards science with\nthat of 1930s Stalinist Russia \u2013\nwhere Lysenkoism promoted\nunsuccessful and damaging\nscientific theories that fell in\nline with ideology, rather than\nsuccessful theories that were\nsupported by experiment.\nThis sort of antiscientifc\nattitude is not surprising considering that George W Bush\nwas once famously quoted as\nsaying \u201cthe jury\u2019s still out\u201d on\nwhether man had descended\nfrom the apes. Bush is not a\nman who is affected by overwhelming and incontraven-able scientific evidence.\nThe real scientific battlegrounds this year are on the\nissues of climate change and\nstem cell research, where\nthe candidates take opposing\nstances. On climate change,\nthe Bush administration has\nbeen heavily criticised for dismissing cuts in greenhouse\ngas emissions recommended\nby the Kyoto Protocol. They\nclaim to favour the development of cleaner fuel-burn-ing technologies and voluntary industry-led reductions.\nKerry has also dismissed the\nKyoto Protocol in its current\nformat, but is keen to resume\ninternational climate change\nnegotiations. Unsurprisingly,\nKerry is widely held to be the\ngreener candidate.\nBush\u2019s position on climate\nchange can be attributed\nto his party\u2019s extensive ties\nwith the oil industry, who\nbankrolled his 2000 election\nsuccess. For example, Dick\nCheney, the vice-president,\nwas the former chief executive of oil giants Halliburton,\na company who have swept\nup billions of dollars worth of\nIraqi oil contracts.\nWhen it came to human\nembryonic stem cell research,\nBush based his decision to\ngo against the advice of scientists on his concerns for\n\u201cviolating ethical principles\u201d\nand his insistence on \u201cmaintaining respect for all human\nlife\u201d. His all-out ban on the\nfederal funding of research\non stem cell lines created\nafter August 2001 (which does\nstill allow limited research on\nolder samples) would, how-ever, be lifted by an incoming\nKerry administration.

The decision was\ntaken in the absence of the\nPresident, and without the\ninput of the Union\u2019s Executive\nCommittee.

And that was before a single band had hit the stage. Cue: \u2018The\nWorst Reading Festival Ever.\u2019\nFriday\nI can think of no better band to coax\nme out of my mud-induced strop\nthan Jurassic 5. Refreshingly un-gangster, this bouncy, melodic, old\nschool hip hop act amused the soggy\ncrowd with hand clapping games\nand solos on toys from the Early\nLearning Centre. The mental age\nof the crowd was well anticipated\nthen. In contrast, Hole wannabes\nThe Distillers (like the dull, arduous\ntask of the same name) sounded so\nunvaried that their set may as well\nhave comprised of one thirty minute\ntrack. It\u2019s a shame Brody Dahl\u2019s\ncomplicated soap-style love life is\nthe most interesting thing the band\nhave going for them.\nSlightly more engaging were The\nHives. In three words: same as ever,\nbut since they consistently provide\nan energetic onslaught of tunes and\ngood humour, I couldn\u2019t complain.\nThank you, or should I say you\u2019re\nwelcome? Which is more than I will\nsay to Ash\u2019s shameless omission of\nflagship tracks Goldfinger and Oh\nYeah, making for a set devoid of any\ntruly inspiring moments. However,\nthrowing in a flaming guitar and\nHar Mar Superstar shaking his sizeable bootie certainly livened things\nup \u2013 as Tim Wheeler so aptly put it,\n\u201cdance motherf**ker, dance!\u201d\nAs ever, The Offspring proved\nthemselves incapable of disappoint-ing. Their set was clearly tailored to\nmore hardy fans, including a good\nsmattering from Smash, a fairly\nuncommercial selection from later\nalbums and the thankful exclusion\nof The Worst Hangover Ever, a steel\ndrum extravaganza that may well\nhave been penned by a fifteen-year-old fan. Front man Dexter Holland\nwas charismatic as ever, providing\nthe front row with popcorn in case\nthey were hungry, and splashing out\non the more confetti than you can\nshake a stick at.\nIn the style of a \u2018Time Life, can\u2019t\nbuy this in the shops, best rock\ndross in the world ever volume 10\u2019\neffort, The Darkness were awful.\nLike a showcase for IndulgentGuitar-Solos-R-Us but sadly lacking\nin any kind of imaginative spandex\non the part of Justin \u2018I don\u2019t act like\na dick, I just am a dick\u2019 Hawkins,\n50% of their hits were over within\nthe first two songs. I\u2019m not sure that\none gimmicky album, a sad failure\nat a Christmas number one and\nlacklustre fireworks should constitute a headline act.\nSaturday\nFollowing an extended and incoherent poetry session, the New York\nDolls treated us to an inoffensive if\nunstirring set of slightly mellowed\npunk, including the delicately covered Take Another Little Piece Of\nMy Heart. It was an adequate kickoff to \u2018Festival of Discomfort\u2019 Day\nTwo.\nThe Mercury Prize winning Franz\nFerdinand live experience was a\nsmooth and polished affair, to the\npoint where, upon closing my eyes,\nI almost believed I was back in my\nbedroom in pyjamas rather than\nmuddy jeans. I was glad to hear the\nextended version of Take Me Out,\nand with cute explanations as to the\nmeaning of each track, I watched\nwith a smile on my face and a moderate boogie in my hips.\nWatching Morrissey is simply\nmagic. This man, his band, and the\nten foot letters spelling his name\nsparkle. As the sun set, Morrissey\nprovided a relaxed, melodic, and\ncharming selection of songs. He\ntalked of his dislike for Radio One\nand small British towns that issue\nillicit speeding tickets, but even this\nwas done in a soothing and persuasive manner. Recent single First Of\nThe Gang To Die was the festival\nhigh point, with the whole crowd\nsinging their lungs out. 55,000 people can\u2019t be wrong.\nIn the past year, The White Stripes\nhaven\u2019t released a new album, had\na number one single or toured the\nworld. So how did they manage to\nmove up the bill from the penultimate slot they occupied (and pulled\nout of) last year? Scraping the bottom of the band barrel methinks?\nI enjoy The White Stripes in a CD\ncapacity. Their sound is unique and\nthey are undoubtedly clever musi-cians. However the lack of band-members, means their live performance will always be limited. In\na set a little too concerned with\nself-important solos, their real gems\nwere drowned out with the exception of Jolene, but then they didn\u2019t\nwrite that anyway.\nSunday\nMaybe the bottling of The Rasmus\nwas the crowd\u2019s effort to accelerate\nthe coming of the Dropkick Murphys.\nWith the emphasis on good old fashioned DM stomping Irish punk fun,\nthe Boston boys certainly brought\ntheir share of diverse instruments,\nguest vocalists, heartfelt dedica-tions, band members crowd surfing,\nand honeys from the audience dancing on stage. Energetic, traditional,\nand certainly well liked.\nThe Streets are never on quite late\nenough at Reading. Consequently,\nthis year MC Mike Skinner was\nforced to lead a somewhat baffled\ncrowd: \u201cSee, we can mix dance\nand rock if you jump on the spot\nlike this!\u201d he coaxed \u2013 and to some\neffect. With a good mix of the old and\nthe new, and reserving the finger-shaking classic Don\u2019t Mug Yourself\nfor the end, I think on this occasion\nthey pulled it off.\nPlacebo may be regarded as festival fodder but it certainly does\nbring out the best in them. Sporting\na new, less glam look, Brian Molko\nwas at once a childlike and alluring\nfront man. The set itself was perfectly conceived and full of forgotten favourites including the understated Scared Of Girls. Heartfelt,\nmoody, beautifully performed and\ncrowned with the lately neglected\nNancy Boy, this was Placebo in\ntheir full glory.\nIf the Reading Festival was a football game, 50 Cent would be man\nof the match. Hours in advance\nof his performance, skinny, smug,\nstraggly haired adolescents with\ntoggled combats had been collect-ing... bottles. Sidekick G Unit had\nbarely hit the stage when the sky\nwas filled like a sea of plastic, yet\nwhat\u2019s this? 50 Cent hurling bottles\nstraight back, except his are still\nfull! Brilliant! Drama still continuing\nand the Cent-meister still grinning,\nthe few fans present were treated to\na selection of hits before someone\nthrew a chair at the stage. As it\nturned out, this was the straw that\nbroke the camel\u2019s back.\nIf every American was a fan of\npunk rock music, Bush would have\nbeen overthrown long ago in some\nsort of spiky, tartan trouser-based\ncoup. Tonight, Green Day were flying the flag for the Anti-Dubya con-sortium, riding on the back of new\nalbum American Idiot. It had all the\ningredients of a classic Green Day\ngig: an impromptu band formation\nwith ironic drummer Marc \u2018the Kid\u2019\nOrrell (guitarist with the Dropkick\nMurphys) and some kid called\nBarney-as-in-the-dino on guitar, a\npredictably silly costume to accompany King For A Day, and an evenly\nmixed array of songs to represent\ntheir back catalogue. A meaningful but not overbearing outing from\na band that rightly deserved the\naccolade of ending the festival. In\na weekend of The Darkness, Green\nDay were truly a beacon of light.\nGiulia Clark\nCarling Reading Festival\nA field, near Reading\nHHIII\nFlying home: bottles making their summer migration from the muddy fields of Reading\nMasters\nof breezy,\nsouthern\nCalifornian\npop return\nALBUM REVIEW\nIt\u2019s very easy to review an album\nthat\u2019s really good. It\u2019s even easier\nto review an album that\u2019s crap, as\nyou can just focus on all the things\nthat are shite. But to write about an\nalbum which isn\u2019t amazing and isn\u2019t\ncrap but somewhere in between is\nharder. Let\u2019s Bottle Bohemia, the\nsecond album by The Thrills, is just\nsuch an album. They\u2019ve chosen not\nto change the winning formula of\nSo Much For The City and if you\ndidn\u2019t like that one, you won\u2019t like\nthis either.\nI can easily imagine people whing-ing about it being \u201csamey\u201d, because\nit is, but that\u2019s not necessarily a bad\nthing. It\u2019s not the best album of the\nyear, I won\u2019t have nightmares about\nthe disc being scratched, but I may\nwell cause dogs to howl in pain by\nsinging along to the lyrics. In a couple of years\u2019 time I\u2019ll still be playing\nit and that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. It\u2019s\na good album, with good songs, and\nstrong lyrics. Whatever Happened\nto Corey Haim will happily stick in\nyour mind along with most of the\nother tracks.\nThe Beach Boy cheeriness of So\nMuch For The City has taken a\nbackseat to some excellent Coldplayesque melancholy, most notably in\nNot For All The Love In The World.\nThere\u2019s even a bit of soul searching\nabout the ups and downs of fame\nin You Can\u2019t Fool Old Friends With\nLimousines. In essence, it sounds\njust like The Thrills always have\n\u2013 if you like them, you\u2019ll love this\nrecord.\nOlle Akesson\nThe Thrills\nLet\u2019s Bottle Bohemia\n(Virgin Records)\nHHHHI\nFestivals: bringing them all out\n\n"

    "content": "Back and to the left\nThe playwright Christopher Marlowe was stabbed to death at a house in Deptford in 1593, apparently in a\ndrunken brawl. Louise Welsh\u2019s second novel, while a work of fiction, follows the more recent speculation that\nhis killing has more to do with political intrigue. Martin Cansdale explains why Tamburlaine Must Die\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 7 October 2004\n18\nBooks books.felix@ic.ac.uk\nThis book, the author\u2019s second\nnovel, is a fictional account of the\nlast days of Christopher Marlowe.\nTamburlaine is the eponymous\ncharacter of a Marlowe play\nwhich tells of the fourteenth century Mongol warlord\u2019s bloody rise\nto power. In Welsh\u2019s story, bills are\nbeing pasted up all over London,\nthreatening a massacre of immigrants in the city. As they refer\nto Marlowe\u2019s plays and are signed\n\u2018Tamburlaine\u2019, the authorities are\nquick to accuse the unfortunate\nwriter. All that saves Marlowe from\nimmediate punishment is the intervention of Lord Cecil, the Queen\u2019s\nspymaster, for whom Marlowe has\nworked. In an effort to save his own\nlife, he must hunt for the real culprit\nin a plague-stricken London.\nDespite a fair sprinkling of poetry,\nand having a playwright for its hero\nand narrator, this book doesn\u2019t get\nbogged down in literary pretensions.\nAny references to Marlowe\u2019s works\nare explained, and the fast-moving\nstory is based around his life as a\nspy rather than a writer.\nThe narrative style of this book\nreminded me of Alistair MacLean.\nThis may seem strange. What can\na tale set in the sixteenth century\nhave in common with the work of\na great writer of twentieth century\nadventure thrillers? Quite a lot, as\nthe period setting for Welsh\u2019s novel\nsits rather oddly with the tone of the\nwriting. Some passages could come\nstraight from the pages of Where\nEagles Dare, such as: \u201cI thought I\nfelt the prickle of surveillance on\nmy shoulders. And though I knew it\nwas most likely the effect of my own\nblood running faster in my veins,\nI made my way from the crush of\npeople, trying to keep note of who\nwas around me, checking to see if\nany faces lingered in the thinning\ncrowd.\u201d\nTamburlaine Must Die does break\none of MacLean\u2019s rules, though.\nHe included very little sex in his\nstories, for fear of hindering the\naction, whereas this book has two\nmain sexual interludes. Both mix\nstartlingly direct and blunt descriptions with embarrassingly vague\neuphemisms. The first liaison, with\nMarlowe\u2019s patron, is presumably\nintended to show something about\nthe relationship between the two\nmen. Coming just a dozen pages\nin and being dealt with in a seemingly embarrassed rush, it does little more than puzzle.\nIndeed, the brevity of the book as\na whole is a weakness. At around\n25,000 words, this is more novella\nthan novel. There is no room for\nmore of the scene setting, plot twist-ing, and character development that\nthe author seems to do so well. Subplots are introduced and promise\ninterest but then come to nothing.\nFor all this criticism, the book is\nstill very enjoyable to read. Welsh\nbuilds an exciting picture of the\nnoisy capital in a series of busy,\ncrowded, descriptive passages, all\nbenefiting from the voice and views\nof Marlowe as narrator.\nPerhaps as a consequence of its\nshortness, the narrative is exhilarat-ingly fast-paced. The plot, although\nrelatively simple and not following\nsome temptingly suggested twists, is\nexciting enough. Although Marlowe\nis the only character that is really\ndeveloped, this is done well, and\ninterest in his struggle is the main\nstrength of the book.\nIf Tamburlaine Must Die was\ntwice the length, with all the interesting detours that it continually\npromises, it would be a very good\nbook. That aside, it\u2019s still well writ-ten, gripping, and at 149 pages won\u2019t\nget in the way of work for very long.\nTamburlaine Must Die\nby Louise Welsh\n(Cannongate)\n\u00a39.99, 149 pages\nHHHII\n\u201c...the fast-moving\nstory is based around\nhis life as a spy...\u201d\nTeaching an Oldboy new tricks...\n15 years forced to live in a cell, five days to seek revenge\nFilm film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nin association with\nOdeon Kensington\nsee What\u2019s On, page 9\nIf you thought Sympathy For Mr\nVengeance was dark, you haven\u2019t\nseen anything yet. While Park Chan\nWook\u2019s previous movie arguably had\nsome uplifting moments in the otherwise unremitting darkness, Oldboy\ntakes everything down a step.\nThe movie follows the story of\nDae Su (Choi Min Sik), a completely\nunremarkable city worker who goes\nabout his daily business, spending\ntime with his wife and daughter and\ndoing nothing out of the ordinary.\nThat is until one day, he is arrested\nand charged with being drunk and\ndisorderly. Later that evening he is\nreleased and fights his way home\nthrough the sheet-like rain, stopping\nonly to telephone (and presumably,\ngrovel to) his wife. This is when\nthings start getting strange, as DaeSu is kidnapped and taken to a cell.\nThe run-down hotel-style prison\nis his home for an ever-increasing\nlength of time, his only companion\na television, and his captor completely anonymous. He is fed only\nfried dumplings, and is gassed into\nunconsciousness every few months\nfor his room maintenance and\nhaircuts. With nothing else to do to\npass the time, the unlucky inmate\npractices fighting (against a figure\ndrawn on his wall), formulates an\nescape, and seethes hatred towards\nhis incarcerator.\nIn the masterfully condensed subsequent years, Dae Su\u2019s wife is murdered and he is named the chief\nsuspect. Following some unsettling\nhallucinatory scenes (leaving us in\nno doubt that the captive is slowly\nbut surely losing his sanity), he is\ngassed and wakes up on a rooftop,\na free man. In his new suit, he\nfinds a telephone, and on the other\nend is Woo Jin (Yu Ji Tae), the rich\nbusinessman behind fifteen years\nof hellish, reasonless imprisonment.\nDae Su is given five days to work out\nwhy. Falling for sushi bar girl Mi Do\n(Kang Hye Jeong), Dae Su starts to\ntrack down the captor, and a twisted,\nperverse story unfolds.\nOldboy is gritty, unflinching and\nbrutal. Scenes of torture (think teeth\nand a claw hammer) sit right alongside the pitch black humour that\ncrops up from time to time. The\nscene of Dae Su eating a live squid\nhas \u2013 perhaps thankfully, depending\nupon your point of view \u2013 been cut\nfrom the UK theatrical release (no\nspecial effects are used: the squid\nreally is alive, and Choi Min Sik\nreally is eating it). Yet this should\ngive you an idea of the kind of thing\nwe are dealing with here.\nThe macabre content is so well\nshot that it only serves to accentuate the movie\u2019s morose beauty. A\nperfect example of this is the single-shot, five minute fight scene, moving\nup and down a corridor as Dae Su\nfights off swathes of prison guards\nwith just his hammer. Subtle CGI\ntransitions and more apparent sections are well placed, and choppy\nediting mirrors the main character\u2019s disorientation.\nThe often colour-washed shots and\ngloomy settings provide an oppressive atmosphere, making for a truly\nemotionally effective and draining\nfilm. This is aided by convincing\nperformances all around, which also\nhelp make some of the plot\u2019s less\nrealistic turns more believable. A\nscore that could initially seem completely inappropriate soon becomes\ncompelling in the extreme, and is\none of the film\u2019s strongest points.\nThemes include the driving savagery of revenge and a bleak look at\nill-fated love.\nThere are flaws, such as the finale.\nFollowing a climactic few minutes\nof dramatic twists, building tension\nand a superb ending, the film segues\ninto a rather unnecessary final coda,\nlosing the visceral impact of the preceding section.\nHowever, minus the last ten min-utes, Oldboy is an absolute classic.\nUnforgiving yet human, brutal yet\nbeautiful, detached yet emotional,\nit exemplifies all of the best aspects\nof extreme cinema. In an age when\nHollywood is buying up every Asian\nghost movie on the market through\nsheer lack of ideas, here is piece\nthat proves how creative some filmmakers can still be.\nA must-see for extreme and world\ncinema fans.\nRussell Garwood\nOldboy\nDirector: Park Chan Wook\nStarring: Choi Min Sik, Yu Ji Tae,\nKang Hye Jeong\nLength: 120 minutes\nCertificate: 18\nReleased: 15 October\nHHHHI\n\u201cDamn that miniature door\u201d \u2013 Dae Su trapped in his cell\n\n"

    "content": "As the reader may have cleverly noticed from the previous edition of Felix, there\u2019s\na new face in town. Allow me\nto introduce myself as the\nnew editor of the Business\nsection.\nHaving successfully conquered the first year, I am\nabout to embark on the\ntreacherous second year\nof JMC (Joint Maths and\nComputing). If I\u2019m not writing for Felix in Beit Quad,\nyou\u2019ll find me either hitting\nthe keyboard at the Huxley\nlabs or practising Tae Kwon\nDo at Wilson House. With that\nshort intro out of the way, I\ncan now explain exactly what\nI\u2019ll be filling up these pages\nwith every week.\nFirst and foremost, I urge\nthe reader, whatever your\nbusiness orientation may be,\nto contribute to this fountain\nof knowledge by offering anything you deem appropriate.\nIf that means submitting a\nreview of a new bond offering,\nthe transcript of an interview\nwith a CEO or even a sales\npitch for the latest stock to\nhit the market, I want to hear\nfrom you.\nMy aim in all future issues\nwill be to give the reader\nan insight into the previous\nweek\u2019s events, what triggered them and how this will\naffect students at Imperial\nespecially.\nDo bear in mind that a\nwhole week\u2019s events are\nbeing summarised in a fraction of the space taken up\nby a business newspaper\nsuch as the Telegraph or the\nFinancial Times, so forgive\nme if certain stories have\nbeen sacrificed to make way\nfor others.\nI look forward to hearing\nfrom you \u2013 feel free to e-mail\nme at the address below about\nthis article, future industry\nscoops or anything at all that\nyou feel is worth considering.\nI hope these pages will be as\nenjoyable for you to read as\nthey are for me to write.\nBelow are the particulars\nof just a few of the biggest\nstories in the business world\nover the past few weeks.\nCovering the topics that matter\nBusiness business.felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 7 October 2004 3\nLandSec\nA huge property securitisa-tion deal was announced on\nMonday last in a successful\nattempt by Land Securities,\nthe UK\u2019s largest property\ncompany, to ease its debt\naccumulation and increase\nborrowing capacity.\nThe \u00a32.4bn bond issue is the\nresult of a new (and clever)\nrefinancing agreement with\nLloyds Bank and Citigroup,\nwho will jointly underwrite the\nissue. LandSec has decided\nto exchange this bond issue\nin favour to its existing unsecured bonds and mortgage\ndebentures, a form of debt\ninstrument, but without any\nbacking collateral. As a consequence of this, the company will save itself \u00a324m a year\nfrom interest charges alone,\nand since Standard & Poor\u2019s\ndebt rating for LandSec\nhas leaped from A- to AA, it\nhas increased its borrowing\nstrength considerably.\nHowever, all is not rosy as\nthe firm will witness a deficit\nof almost \u00a3700m in profits due\nto an exceptional accounting\nhit as a result of its refinancing deal.\nLazard\nLazard, the only private\npartnership in global investment banking and one of the\nworld\u2019s most pre-eminent\nfirms, is set to float on the\nstock market by the end of\nthis week. For all you future\nLazard I-Bankers, now\u2019s the\ntime to concentrate.\nThe 156-year-old bank\u2019s\nfuture lay last week at the\nhands of Lazard\u2019s chairman,\nMichel David-Weill, and his\ninvesting group, Eurazeo.\nThe man behind the IPO\npush is Bruce Wasserstein,\nthe legendary investment\nbanker at Lazard who has\nhad continuing discussions\nwith the firm\u2019s partners and\nWeill to tempt them into\ngoing public. However, given\nWasserstein\u2019s success in the\npast with selling Wasserstein,\nPerella & Co to Dresdner\nBank in 2000, it is only expected that Wasserstein can see a\nsale through the corner of\nhis eye to Deutsche Bank or\nthe Bank of America, both of\nwhom have given indications\nof their interest in buying\nLazard. The firm\u2019s success in\nthe past has been attributed\nto the fact that it has decided\nto specialise in giving mergers and acquisitions advice to\nlarge corporations as well as\nhaving a small but successful underwriting and trading\npractice.\nThis success, though, cannot continue without Lazard\nexpanding due to the ever-increasing size of its main\ncompetitors, Goldman\nSachs, Morgan Stanley and\nDresdner KW.\nCrude oil price surge\nUrgent action is needed\nto ensure that sky-high oil\nprices do not derail the stability of the global economy,\nthe International Monetary\nFoundation reported last\nweek. Crude oil, one of the\nmost rapidly rising commodities of all time, has been rising unexpectedly for over two\nyears now, due to almost a\ndozen different factors.\nAmong the most influential of these were the threat\nby Nigerian rebels to disrupt supplies, a hurricane\nin the Gulf of Mexico that\nlowered output, and the fact\nthat China\u2019s industry is now\nguzzling 6.3m barrels a day,\nsecond only to the US.\nNow that the price of crude\noil futures has reached the\npsychologically important $50\nmark, consumers are starting to feel the pinch more\nthan ever. But it is the less\ntechnologically advanced oil\ndrilling and extraction industries who have actually been\nhit hardest by this landmark\nprice. ChevronTexaco, for\ninstance, drilled the deepest well ever last year (four\nmiles), but the only difference it made to their balance\nsheet was a $50m deficit, the\ncost of the operation.\nOn the other hand, Pennzoil\nCompany, a much smaller\ntechnologically advanced\nfirm, spent much of its\nresources in pinpointing\nexactly where in their global\nfields the hidden sources of\noil and gas were. This strategy paid off for Pennzoil, who\nmade $6.4bn when it sold\nit\u2019s richest fields to Union\nPacific Resources Group\nIncorporated. So what can\nwe, Imperial students, learn\nfrom this price rampage\nthat has shocked so many\nand left thousands of smaller\nbusinesses bust? Well, now\nis definitely not the time to\nbuy a petrol-greedy Ferrari\nScaglietti!\nThe future\nThe future, the future.\nIndeed if I could predict the\nfuture I would have a dozen\nScaglietti\u2019s in my assets portfolio by now. Alas it is not so;\ninstead I propose the next\nbest thing, my predictions.\nTo think that the M&S saga\nwas over is foolish. It may\nseem that Philip Green\u2019s bid\nfor Marks & Spencer four\nmonths ago was his last, but\ninsiders have revealed that\nGreen has approached HSBC\nfor additional funding. Up to\n$1bn was being requested to\nhelp finance his future takeo-ver. That\u2019s right, you heard it\nhere first: Green is planning\nanother takeover of M&S to\nsatisfy his fetish for retailers\nand to add to his present collection of Burton, BHS and\nArcadia.\n\u201cLazard prepares to\ndefend a hostile takeover\nfrom Deutsche Bank\u201d has\na fair chance of making the\nheadlines next week. Given\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s recent fall\nin mergers and acquisitions\nrevenues, this would be an\nunderstandable move, as\nLazard is renowned worldwide for it\u2019s strength in mergers and acquisitions advisory\nservices.\nLatest from the Square Mile\nWith one very eventful week coming to a close on Sunday, you should anticipate some\nshocking headlines in the next fortnight\nPrice perplexity: the value of crude oil is increasing by the day and these containers in Germany look set to empty\nNUMAAN CHAUDHRY\nBUSINESS EDITOR\n\n"

    "content": "Your immediate inclination\nmay be to skip the Careers\nsection, especially if you\u2019re\na fresher or in the middle of\nyour studies \u2013 after all, there\u2019s\nplenty of time to worry about\nyour post-university career,\nright? Wrong.\nNow, employers want the lot\n\u2013 a good degree just doesn\u2019t\ncut it. They want to know you\nhave a multitude of relevant\nskills, with evidence to prove\nit. When, in your final year,\nthe panic of being cast out\ninto the real world begins\nto set in, the Freshers Fair\nsuddenly becomes a must.\nJoining Dance or Debating\nat this late stage may help\nto show you\u2019re a more \u2018wellrounded\u2019 person but it probably won\u2019t be enough to get\nyou the job you have been\ndreaming about (that is, if\nyou\u2019re lucky enough to know\nwhat you want to do).\nDeveloping a repertoire\nof skills and a glowing CV\nare your keys to a successful\nfuture and it\u2019s important to\nbear this in mind from the out-set. Even if you have no idea\nwhat career path you want to\ntake, that\u2019s even more reason\nfor getting involved and discovering what\u2019s out there.\nWe\u2019re the first to admit to\nwhiling away our undergraduate years in various London\nwatering holes, blissfully unaware of the harsh realities\nand competitiveness of the\nworld awaiting us. Therefore,\nperhaps it isn\u2019t surprising to\nhear that we are still students\n\u2013 PhD students, with another\nthree years of shelter under\nthe umbrella that is university (actually, a PhD can be a\nvery difficult undertaking that\nmay postpone \u2018decision time\u2019\nbut brings numerous other\nstresses. However, that\u2019s\nanother story).\nWorryingly, psychologists\nhave identified a new phenomenon occurring in the\nmid-twenties, termed the\n\u2018quarterlife crisis\u2019. It\u2019s a\ngeneral depression that hits\ngraduates who are suddenly\nfaced with the difficulties of\nbuilding a life for themselves\nin a world where good jobs\nare hard to come by and adult\nlife seems rather stressful\nand mundane with all its tedious responsibilities.\nThe Felix Careers section\ntherefore aims to help and\nencourage students to make\na successful transition from\ntheir degree studies, be they\nundergraduate or postgradu-ate, to their career paths. By\nproviding advice and informa-tion, we hope to allow you to\nidentify some of the necessary skills you will need, ways\nto develop them, and see the\nrelevance of these skills in different working environments.\nHow to promote yourself and\nyour abilities and manage\nyour university time effectively will also be discussed,\nalong with links to the best\nresources and information\nabout work experience and\nupcoming events.\nPerhaps at the start of your\ndegree you had an idea about\nwhat you hoped to achieve.\nDuring your studies it\u2019s useful to revisit those objectives,\nto assess the progress you\u2019re\nmaking and also add to them.\nEven if you are still not clear\nabout what you want to do\nafter you finish, it\u2019s never\ntoo late to set goals for your\nprofessional and personal\ndevelopment. To ensure you\nare able to tackle the transition and find a promising job,\nmake the most of your university life, the resources and\nthe people. Imperial has an\nexcellent careers department\nwhere you can arrange one-to-one talks with experienced\nadvisors, and provides a vast\nchoice of clubs, societies and\nstudent activities.\nPlease feel free to contact\nus with your comments on\nthis section, any thoughts or\nquestions, or if you would like\na particular topic to be cov-ered.

Firstly, a \u2018filtering\nout\u2019 process is conducted\nby Human Resources (HR)\nbased on applicants\u2019 CVs. If\nyour CV is picked out, you\nwill be invited to a first interview with employees working\nin the department. If they like\nyou, you\u2019ll be asked to spend a\nfew days on the trading floor,\ntaking part in simulated and\nproblem solving exercises\nalongside other applicants.\nGet through all this and\nthere\u2019s a final interview with\nmore senior members of the\ndepartment.\nHR look for a number of\nkey things in a CV. Firstly a\ngood academic record is very\nimportant \u2013 without good\ngrades it tends to be more\ndifficult. True to their litera-ture, Citigroup will potentially\nrecruit from any degree dis-cipline: \u201cI don\u2019t look for an\neconomics degree. What\u2019s\nimportant is that they\u2019ve\ndone their research and can\nhave a conversation with\nme about the markets\u201d. The\nother main things HR look\nfor in a CV are previous work\nexperience in finance, which\nis evidence of a real desire\nto work in the industry, and\nlinguistic abilities: \u201cYou\u2019ll go\nto the top of the pile if you\u2019re\nfluent in other languages\u201d. It\nis, however, still possible to\nbe recruited without a second\nlanguage.\nIf your CV is selected,\nyou\u2019ll then be interviewed.\n\u201cAt interview I\u2019m thinking of\ntwo things \u2013 firstly, do they\nunderstand the workings of\nthe market, and secondly,\ncan we work with, and get\non with, this person?\u201d The\ngeneral gist was that you\nmust know your stuff and be\nfriendly and confident. Don\u2019t\nbe afraid to sell yourself and\ndon\u2019t appear \u2018flaky\u2019. If you are\nthen asked to take part in the\nexercises \u2018on the floor\u2019, you\nneed to demonstrate an ability to handle stress well and\nwork efficiently with other\npeople: \u201cYou won\u2019t be successful on the trading floor\nunless you\u2019re tough\u201d.\nIf you still think you\u2019re\nsuited, then the pluses are\nnumerous \u2013 great salary,\npotential mega bonuses,\nexpense accounts, trips\nabroad (not just work but also\nclient entertainment), and\nevenings and weekends free,\nsince obviously the markets\nclose.\nInside story: recruitment at Citigroup\nBy Gabriella Silvestri\nand Cassandra Aldrich\nIt makes sense to plan ahead,\nwhether you want to take\ntime out, go on to further\nstudy, find employment or\neven if you have no idea what\nyou\u2019re going to do. You will\nfind achieving your goals satisfying and more enjoyable\nand ultimately be more suc-cessful. Whichever route you\nchoose to follow, you will need\nrelevant information to help\nyou on your way.\nDid you know that 87% of\nstudents agree that university is a good investment,\nand people with a higher\neducation qualification are\nlikely to earn on average 50%\nmore than those without?\nHowever, although the graduate job market has grown and\nbecome more diverse, recent\nstudies have suggested that\ngraduates struggle to find\ntheir ideal roles in today\u2019s\nrecruitment market, which is\nnow less predictable.\nAccording to research carried out by the Association of\nGraduate Recruiters (AGR),\nwhich predominantly represents large blue chip firms\nand public sector employers,\nthere is intense competition\nin the employer\u2019s market.\nEmployers received an average of 42.1 applications for\nevery graduate vacancy during the past year, up from 37.2\nin 2001-02.\nThe mistake often made is\nto think that a degree from\nImperial is sufficient to get\nany job. Although your degree\nis a mark of your intellectual ability and your potential,\nmany employers will place\nless importance on your subject of study than the personal skills and qualities you\npossess. Continuous personal\nlearning is becoming increasingly important as employers\nsearch for the very best can-didates.\nThe five essential skills for\nemployment (as given in the\nImperial Careers Advisory\nService Guide) are:\n\u25cf teamwork ability\n\u25cf communication\n\u25cf interpersonal skills\n\u25cf problem solving\n\u25cf planning and organising.\nJoining a sports team is\noften looked upon favourably\nas evidence of teamwork abil-ities, while joining a student\nsociety may demonstrate\ninterpersonal skills.\nVoluntary work, a well-planned gap year and work\nplacements will help to\nstrengthen your CV and\ncomplement your academic\nabilities. If you are planning\nto take time out from your\nstudies you should organise\nsome useful work experience\nor alternatively work first\nto fund subsequent travels.\nSimply jet-setting around\nthe world is less impressive.\nArranging work abroad, how-ever, will look great.\nPlanning your next move\nTHE \u2018MUST\u2019 POINTS\n\u25cf Evaluate your abilities\n\u25cf Build a portfolio of skills\n\u25cf Set personal objectives\n\u25cf Go to your Careers Service\n\u25cf Think about a career plan\nClimbing the steps: planning your next move can help your career reach new heights\nCareers\nevents and\nuseful links\nTALK\nSUCCESSFUL INTERVIEWS\nThursday 7 Oct, 1.00\u20131.50pm\nClore Lecture Theatre, Huxley\nBuilding\nSpeaker: Ana-Viktoria Gale,\nPricewaterhouseCoopers\nTALK\nWHAT IS MANAGEMENT\nCONSULTANCY?\nTuesday 12 Oct, 1.00\u20131.50pm\nClore Lecture Theatre, Huxley\nBuilding\nSpeaker: Emma Killick,\nMcKinsey and Company\nEXHIBITION\nNATIONAL GRADUATE\nRECRUITMENT EXHIBITION\nFriday 15 Oct, 11am\u20135pm\nSaturday 16 Oct, 11am\u20134pm\nHall 3, Wembley, London\nMore info: www.gradjobs.co.uk\nEVENT\nLONDON MEDIA CAREERS\nINFORMATION DAY\nWednesday 20 Oct,\n10.30am\u20134.30pm\nExCeL Centre, Docklands\nMore info: www.mediacareers-day.co.uk\nLINKS\nhttp://www.ic.ac.uk/careers\nhttp://www.shell-livewire.org/\nthebigtrip\nhttp://www.prospects.ac.uk/\nhttp://www.newscientistjobs.\ncom/graduate/\nhttp://www.doctorjob.com\n\u25cf The Careers section\nwill appear in Felix every\ntwo weeks\n\n"
