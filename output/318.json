Ignoring this I shall\ntake up my index finger and\nstart hitting the keys.\nPerhaps the biggest nonevent of the year/century\nmust be the ICU Presidential\nUnelection. It was brilliantly\ndisrupted by the CCU executives, or rather that's their\nstory. I prefer to take this\nview. With the academic year\nbeing so far advanced, not to\nelect a president becomes a greater embarrassment than\nelecting someone of the\ncalibre of Rob Hermitage. His\npersonal inadequacies could\nbe easily covered by Messrs.\nPaul T.T.C. C.H. Jowitt and\nMartin Oedipus, Schmoedipus, what's it matter so long\nas you love your mother.\nBlack with the help of the\nCCU execs. With regard to\nIC UGM's, has mc b ever\nheard of the Law of Diminishing Returns?\nTurning now to the matter\nof Rag. Could someone tell\nme how we manage to get\nsuch in ineffectual rag chairman (he doesn't deserve cap-it als) as Pout Horsekiss.\nDoes he realise the harm he\nhas done in distributing can\nlabels which bear no relation to the la ice n ces he dis-tributes? I for one do not\nlook forward to having collectors arrested.\nPerhaps he reasons that so\nlong as he doesn't get nicked\nit all matters not (when you\nthink about it, if you don't do any collecting you will\nnever get arrested; this\nshould worry all the keen\ncollectors). On a lighter note,\nhe is a good MA TCH for Rob,\nIs it my turn to be Mummy,\nArmitage?\nHoping this reaches you as\nit leaves me (i.e. unedited),\nI remain who I was when\nI started,\nLome Pedyn\n(Name and address sup-plied)\nP.S. Senator McGovern has\nturned down Piers, who\nneeds to be a millionaire,\nCorbyn's request that he\nshould stand for IC President\nas socs oc candidate.\nCar Daubing\n- Again!\nSir.\u2014I should like to add my\nsupport to those people complaining about the scurrilous\nactivities of this so-called\nl. C.A.P.S. Organisation.\nIt is this sort of car wrecking activity which gives students a bad name, these lay-about s need a bit of sense\nkicking into them, a touch\nof their own medicine, the\nnoose.\nThe I. C.A.P.S. stickers are\nnow on sale in the IC Union\noffice.\nYours disgusted,\nSIR GEP-V.D AARDWARK\n(Mrs.),\nother wi o* kt\u00bb.3w n as Andy\nLewcock, r x hy s.2. P.S.I am in no way connected with this car daubing\nactivity. I deny it all.\nEditor's note: Correspondence on this topic is now\nclosed.\nIs the\nEditor\ndoing his\njob?\nSir.\u2014On glancing through\nthe pages of the latest issue\nof Felix, I could not help noticing the abnormally large\nempty spaces between the\nvarious articles. I then remembered one of your staff\nmentioning that you were\nhaving difficulty in filling\nFelix every week, but I suddenly realised what was\nreally missing \u2014 advertise-ment s. Remembering back to last\nyear and to endless hours\nspent at Council Meeting discussing the pros and cons of\na weekly Felix with sabbatical editor, I recall that the\nmost important argument put\nforward by the Felix staff\nthen. This was that a sabbatical editor would be required\nto spend a large proportion\nof his time in persuading vast\nnumbers of companies to\nadvertise in Felix, thereby regaining most of the money\nspent on extra printer's costs\nand, of course, the sabbatical\nyear.\nReflecting upon this fact,\none wonders whether our\nesteemed editor is doing the\njob he is being paid for. On\nlooking through the six issues\nof weekly Felix so far pro-du ced,I discovered that there\nwere no outside advertisements AT ALL (i.e. other\nthan Bookshop ads, etc.) in\nthree of the issues, only one\nsixth-pag ad. in another, and\ntwo incredibly small ads in\nthe fifth. It seems that the\nonly time any reasonable effort was put into obtaining\nadverts was for the first issue\nof term when there was the\namazing number of three.\nWhat has our editor been doing for six weeks?\nI humbly suggest, there-fore, that you pull out your\nproverbial finger, sir, and\nshow Union members that\nyou are capable of earning\nyour keep before they decide\nthat they do not wish to support you\u2014financially or\notherwise.\nYours faithfully,\nCHRIS FEARN LEY\nP.S. You've got no excuse\nfor not printing this as I'm handing it in early enough.\nPlease do not mutilate it in\nany way.\nIt is clear that you do not\nunderstand the problems of\nproducing even such a small\npublication as FELIX every\nweek, Mr. Fearnley.\nI considered that it was\nof primary importance to establish FELIX in its weekly\nslot, and it has taken me\nsome time to ensure a regular supply of printable mater-i al. It takes me in excess of\n20 hours a week alone to\ntype and lay out the copy. At\nleast another 30 in research,\nwriting and keeping in touch\nwith printers advertising\nagents and columnists.\nYet I DO find time to go\nout in search of advertising.\nUnfortunately, being a specialised publication, it is to\nsay the least very difficult to\nget advertising\u2014and it is impossible locally because of\nthe price. I am therefore now\nselling space by features,\nwhich works rather better\u2014\nyou should see some results\nin the HiFi feature in a week\nor two. You cannot appreciate the difficulties of space\nselling until you try it\u2014why\ndon't you?\nFinally, may I add that advertising to date in FELIX is\nup to the level of \u00a360 net\nper issue budgeted for after\nall commission, etc., deductions and I remain optimistic\nabout the future.\nOLIVER F. DOWSON\nMascotry\nRemembered\nSir.\u2014Today mascot ry has become virtually a thing of the\npast. Those colleges who still\npossess mascots guard them\nso carefully that they appear\nvery rarely, always under\nvery close guard.\nThis has been brought\nabout by a few colleges\nactive in \"nicking\" mascots,\nwho have not offered their\ntrophies for return within\ntwo weeks but has stashed\nthem in vaults or taken them\nto far off places \u2014 and\nusually forgetting them.\nAnyone who has read\nscrap books of the Union or\ntalked to old boys will know\nthat in the past mascots exchanged hands regularly and\nafter amusing chases and\ntreasure hunts there would\noften be a mock battle during\nwhich their mascot was re-gained.\nThose hunts clues would\nbe found on such places as\nSnowdon, Brighton pier, or\neven local pubs and bars,\nthen ending at the capturing\ncollege's union for a water,\nflour and soot bomb battle.\nI would like to emphasise\nthat all this happened in less\nthan three Weeks.\nConsidering ICU's present\nsituation in which MIKE\n(that's ICU's mascot) has\nbeen taken, possibly dama g ed, dismantled and since\nkept in separate pieces\u2014God\nknows where\u2014for two years!\nNow QMC, who have Mike,\nare demanding \u00a325 for it\u2014\ncovered in green mould and\nengraved.\nMy personal opinion is that\nin the face of present Union\nfinance we should not pay\nsuch amounts, regardless of\nthe good causes it may be\ndestined for. We should be\ngiven the chance to recapture\nMike, without the need for\nany acetylene cutters or\nthermal lances, etc.\nAlso after Friday's very\nsick events in which Guilds'\nLord Mayor's Show float was\nsmashed by some irresponsible idiots\u2014in the name of\nmascot ry? People should be\nreminded that certain mas-cots, especially vehicles, college and personal property,\nare inviolate.\nFinally I would like to see\nW.H.O. working effectively,\nbut please, keep things inter-e sting.

Basically 'I and Albert'\n(can you think of a worse title?) covers Victoria's reign, from the time that she takes the\nThrone (song), though her meeting Albert (song),\nthe Great Exhibition (pageant and song), Crimea\n(disillusion), Albert's death (melancholy song),\nto her Diamond Jubilee (big company number),\nbut the feeling left after all this pageantry, is\none of emptiness.\nThe basic problem is one\nof cohesiveness, for this\nshow tries to be all things\nto all men\u2014a heavy drama,\na costume drama and a satirical song-and-dance all in\none. There is a finely constructed sense of fluency\nin the production, with\nscenes linked in an ingenious variety of ways. The\nCoronation procession leads\noff, Victoria steps from beneath her crown into the\nnext scene as her train is\ncarried off by her en tour age. The setting too, is extraordinarily adaptable, with\nthe best back projections 1\ncan remember in any show,\nbut unfortunately all this\ningenuity only highlights\nthe weak points.\nRegrettably, weak points\nreally do abound. Most of\nthe acting is pretty a dom in able, with the very notable\nexception of Lewis Fiander\nas a cynically amusing Lord\nMelbourne, and later as a charming and conjuring\nLord Melbourne. Polly\nJames (she was Beryl in\n'The Liver Birds') tries hard\nas Victoria, and Sven-Bertil\nTaube may be right in his\nportrayal of Albert\u2014-I dun-no, I never met the fella.\nBut otherwise, the cast gives the impression of having\nbeen in this play too long,\nand being thoroughly bored\nby it (and this was only\nthe third night). The script\nis never impressive, and\nfrequently brash, the lyrics\nare largely eminently forget\ntable, and so are most of\nthe tunes. There are a couple of presentable\nsongs, notably \"I 've heard\nthe bloody 'Indoos as it\nworse\" sung by a London\ncrowd, and the song that\nDisraeli sings as he con\njure s up his policies in front\nof the Queen\u2014but these\nsparks of inspiration are\nlost in the mass of mediocrity that surrounds them.\nBut, as I have said, there\nare the makings of a play\nhere, if radically differently\nhandled, for the director\nJohn Schlesinger of \"Mid-night Cowboy\" fame,- has\ntired to present too many\nfaces. The best sketches\nare those in which Victoria\nand Albert play smaller\nparts (or none at all) and\nthe show rams its tongue\nfirmly into its cheek\u2014Melbourne and Palmerston plot\nting, and the Army fighting in the Colonies for \"The\nWidow at Win'sor\". The\nformat (or lack of it) of\n'Oh! What a Lovely War'\nwould have been very suit\nable, but, as it is, the show\npresented is so obviously\ndesigned for the influx of\nAmerican tourists, that it\nwould find a far happier\nhome on Broadway than in\nthe West End. Or Broad\nmoor. Or anywhere.\nBob Carter.\nClassics\nFollowing the expulsion of Soviet diplomats\nfrom the U.K. last year, there was a freeze on\ncultural exchanges between the two countries.\nPerformances to have been given by such\nfamous artists as Sviatoslav Richter and David\nOistrakh were cancelled.\nEarlier fin 1971, however,\nduring the London Symphony Orchestra's tour of\nthe Soviet Union plans had\nbeen made for a series of\nconcerts in this country\nunder the title \"Days of\nMusic of the USSR\".\nThe freeze has apparently\nthawed, for the opening\nconcert of the series was\nheld on Tuesday, 7th November, at the Festival\nHall, with the LSO under\nthe baton of Evgenyi Svetlanov.\nThe choice of the Overture, Russian and Ludmilla\nby Glinka to open the\nevening proved to be ideal.\nThe perfect harmony between conductor and orchestra and the resulting\nfine playing of this lively\npiece set the mood for the\nevening.\nThe programme continued with the all t irn fe favourite, the Tchaikovsky\nPiano Concerto No. 1 (yet\nagain!). As with so many\nother concertos the soloist\nhas open to him two possible interpretations of the\npiece \u2014 either as a virtuoso exercise or as music,\nthe mood and spirit of\nwhich are set by the pian-ist.\nEmit Gilels seemed to\nhave opted for the former.\nThough his performance\nwas technically brilliant, he\nseemed obsessed by a breakneck tempo, as if\ndetermined to set a record\nfor the fastest performance\nof all time.\nLuckily by the third and\nfinal movement, the wild\ntempo of the playing had\nsomewhat calmed and this\ncombined with the perfect\nkeyboard technique for\nwhich Gilels is so famous\nprovided a less intense\nending to the performance\nIf applause can be used as\na measure of enjoyment\nthen the audience were well\npleased, in spite of the ex-c esse s. The best was yet to\ncome. The Shostakovich,\nSymphony No. 5 is a fine\nwork of imaginative and\ndistinctive quality and the\nperformance on Tuesday\nevening was superb. Mr.\nSvetlanov demonstrated\nhow he could build up the\nintensity of the music and\ngenerate a tension across\nthe whole concert hall.\nPerhaps the most impressive of the 4 movements is the third, the Largo\nwith its unusual instrumental features where the LSO\ngave their very best. Without doubt the success of\nthis performance of the\nsymphony stemmed from\nthe delicate balance of the\nrather stately music and its\nfine interpretation by an\norchestra under the complete control of its con-duct or. Records\nThis is, for me, a particularly difficult Album\nto review, as many of the tracks aren't the sort\nof music that I would choose to listen to. More\nknowledgeable people than me have of course\nbeen singing Home's praises for many months\nnow and the standard of playing on this, their\nsecond album, is surprisingly high considering\nthat none of them have had previous experience\nwith \"name\" bands\u2014which would suggest that\nthey've reached the \"threshold of stardom\"\npurely on the excellence of their music. But I find that some of the tracks just become background music because of the vocals, which are\nso much like those of America it almost seems\ndeliver ate( who were America? Oh, they were\nthis incredibly banal group who vanished from\nthe pope scene this summer . . . ) My immediate\nreaction is just not to listen.\nHowever, that's my pro b harmonies .\nlem. This album is going to\nset Home for greater things\nand is even as I write, sell-music on it to cater for\nnearly every taste. I really\nlike parts of it myself. The\nfirst track on the album is\nalso my favourite; called\nDreamer it snorts along at\na cracking pace. The guitar\nis reminiscent of Albert\nLee of Heads Hands and\nFeet. Its best description\nwould probably toe funky:\nthis probably means little\nto most of you. So I 'll expand \u2014 the guitars and\ndrums keep the same, very\nprecise time for most of\nthe number and it sounds\nas though it was r hearse d at great length. It would\nmake a good single, if it\nisn't already. The rest of\nside one doesn't have a track to match the\n\"Dreamer\". \"Fancy Lady,\nHollywood Child\" has nice\nromantic lyrics (a cruel review would describe them\nas \"true\") but the tracks\nsound rather similar to my\nheavy ears. It's those vocal\nSide Two is musically\nmore interesting, with more\nemphasis being placed on\ninstrumentation than on the\nschmaltzy vocals \u2014 there\nare even some freaky\nsound effects and technic\nally \"clever\" stereo switch\ning at the en d of \"West\nern Front\" while \"Baby\nFriend of Mine\" contains\na nice unison passage between electric and acoustic\nguitars. The album reaches\na climax of sorts on the\nfinal track \"Lady of the\nBirds\" in that the group\nreaches a peak in playing\nproficient cy and pro duc tion, but it seems that\nthey're always holding back\nand deliberately restraining\nany emotion in the music\nIf the track could have\nbeen lengthened (although\nit already lasts about eight\nminutes) the result could\nhave been really satisfying\nboth for group and listener\nStill, I expect they sound\nbetter live and I'm looking\nforward to seeing them.\nRecommended to everyone\nexcept me.\n\"Matching Mole's Little Red Record\" (CBS)\n\"What's brown, goes underground, is myopic?\nIt's the mole!\"\nMatching Mole was born\nwhen Robert Wyatt left the\nSoft Machine because of a difference in musical pol-icy. The name itself is from\nthe French, \"Machine\nMolle\" meaning \"Soft\nMachiine\".\nOn first listening their\nMole's Little Red Record\"\ndoesn't make any real im-press ion. Indeed, the lyrics\nseem completely incomprehensible. However, on further listening one begins\nto appreciate the intricate\ntouches of Dave McRae,\nkeyboards (in fact he, more\nclumsiness of Nucleus on\nthan Wyatt, seems to lead\nthe band) although he is\nnot given enough time on\nrecord to expand his solos.\nHis playing is much freer\nthan his pre de css or Dave\nSinclair, who played on the\nfirst album. One begins to\nappreciate the excellent\nbass playing of Bill MacCormick especially on\n\"Flora Fidgit\" which he\nwrote. This track comprises electric piano, syn-thesis er and bass. One\neven begins to enjoy the\nwarmness and innocence of\nRoberts lyrics, and voice,\nespecially on Righteous\nRhumba and God Song.\nBoth were written by guitarist Phil Miller whose\nplaying is precise and\ntasteful throughout the\nalbum. It is rumoured that\nthe band is on the po'nt of\nsplitting up, which would\nbe a shame, since the band\ncome more widely known\nand appreciated.\nA pleasant record, amusing in places, highlighted\nby McRae's keyboard work.\nYour Stars\nIn General. This week is definitely not good for\nArsonists, from the weather report. But from\nthe stars, it is obvious that you do not sell\nyour soul this week, as an increase in demand\nis foreseen in the far-sighted future. If you\ncan lay eggs, you are a chicken, or duck-billed platypus, or having us on.\nAries. Refute any claims to indigestion, as they\nbelong to someone else (see Capricorn, or\nturn over the page). Should you come into\ncontact with elephant it is, buy a wheelbarrow.\nTaurus. Beware of false pieces of wood and\nstrange men with stones. Later in the week,\nthinking about herbaceous borders, and deciding on what to do about them could result\nin problems. Your lucky colour on December\nthe 17th is puce.\nGemini. Walking backwards is inadvisable on\nFriday. On any other day, however, it could\nlead to a new friendship, and a visit to a well-meaning stranger with teeth.\nCancer. Attempt to shake up your golf, and produce a forward drive. If you do not play golf,\nbuttering scones with a one-legged spoon is a good substitute, and could reap financial\nreward.\nLeo. Under no circumstances attempt to dig\nholes between any chair-legs in the next seven\nyears. Resulting hole could become an ob-session, and destroy a romance. Remember\nto cut your toenails at midnight.\nVirgo. This week is a good week for the man\nproduction of puddings. Do not, however\nundergo any form of scalp treatment, or an\nold friend will not recognise you, and neither\nwill the dog. Remember, Christmas is coming.\nLibra. This week will see you striving to keep\na balance between two extremes (i.e. punching holes in buckets and gnashing teeth while\nsipping soup.) Or something like that.\nScorpio. Gobbling peanuts could be disastrous\nfor your ego, or maybe chicken bones have\nmore to explain. Drink dynamite for dynamic\neffects.\nnt arius. This next week will depend very\nmuch on you, or anyone who interrupts the\nNews with startling revelations. It is in your\nfavour to eat.\nCapricorn. If you have a friend who is an Ariean,\ndo not venture too deep into the desert this\nweek. He/she/it may have indigestion to pass\non to you.\nAquarius. Do not walk around in treetops, or\nbarrels of turgid carrots and banana splits.\nTry, instead, to involve yourself with washers\non bath taps.\nPisces. Do not become submerged in baskets of\nexotic fruits.\n\u2014Arnold.\nPaperbacl\nNERVE by Dick Francis (Penguin, 30p) It looked like the finish for Rob Finn. A brief\nspell of brilliance, then last for race after race.\nHad his nerve really gone?\nWas it dope?\nOr was\u2014the reason so twisted it didn't even\nbear thinking about.\nWell, if you finished that\nboring twaddle then this is\nyour sort of novel. If you\nread the Daily Express and\nadore the Queen Mother\n(that's me\u2014Ed) then I'm beginning to see how Dick\nFrancis makes his money\n\u2014easily.\nPerhaps this is the sort\nof thriller that you can take\nhome and not worry about\nit if your mother gets hold\nof it\u2014nice, safe sex, minor\nviolence, what more could\none ask for.\nDick Francis weaves a web of suicide and corruption in the racing stables\nwith very little new ideas\nof interesting twists to his\nplot. The scene is ancient,\nthe story backyard and the\ncharacters tired. At times I expected to turn the page\nand read \" OK, it's a fair\ncop g uv \u2014I 'll come quietly\"\nbut alas I was disappointed.\nInstead all I got was lots\nof horsey characters playing the heavy criminal type,\nover-written as though in a play they would be over-acted.\nThe novel starts quite\nreasonably with Art Matthews a fallen (near) champion jockey messily shooting himself in the middle of\nthe parade ring at Dunstable races. Lo and behold\nour hero is standing right\nnext to him when he does\nit\u2014pretty predictable so\nfar, then read further. Not\nonly is Art's trainer giving\nhim the raw end of the deal\nbut he's not exactly loved\nby all the other jockeys\u2014\nso who dun it? The story\nrolls on like this through\nevery one of its 224 pages\nand it amazes me that Penguin turn out verbiage like\nNerve. Surely there must\nbe a few more authors who\nhave never been published\nwho can do better than this.\nWell, I shan't tell you\nwhat it was that was so\n\"twisted it didn't even bear\nthinking about?\" but I doubt\nif you're in for much of a surprise.

    "content": "Page 6 FELIX November 14, 1972\nFELIX FINANCIALLY\nContinuing his series of financial articles, Derek Cummings says\nIt's their money you're after!\nIn my last article, you may remember, I dealt\nwith the reasons why property prices had increased\nand why, in my opinion, the apparent levelling off\nin prices which we are now seeing, is only a temporary lull.\nI also promised to examine the problem from\nthe point of view of a prospective house buyer,\nsuggesting where money can be borrowed, how\nmuch can be obtained, and how the gap between the\nsum raised on mortgage and the actual market price\nof a house might be bridged. In the first place, there\nare basically four sources from which money can\nbe borrowed on mortgage. Nine out of ten mortgages on private dwelling houses come from building societies. The other ten per cent are split between local authorities, insurance companies and\nprivate mortgagors.\nLet me start by deal-ing, briefly, with the last\nthree.\nLOCAL AUTHORITIES.\nCurrently, they can lend\nup to eight thousand\npounds, but, since they\ncan only do so when\nfunds are available, they\nare a pretty uncertain\nsource. Furthermore, you\nhave to live within council boundaries, and the\nproperty in question\nmust be within that area.\nINSURANCE COMPANIES. If you can find\nan insurance company\nwhich does provide a mortgage service, you'll\nfind strings attached,\nnamely an insistence\nthat you also buy a large\nendowment policy to\ncover the transaction, regardless of whether you\nreally need insurance.\nPRIVATE MORTGAGORS. Usually tied to the\ndevelopers of new hous-More Rag $tun ts Pictures ing estates and apartment blocks. It's doubtful if they'll offer you\nanything better than a building society will\noffer.\nBUILDING SOCIETIES. As a general rule, a building society will lend\nyou up to 95 per cent of\ntheir valuation of a house, provided that 95\nper cent does not exceed\nthree times your annual\nsalary, and provided the\nhouse is not more than\nfifty years old and is\nstructurally sound. Lending money for mortgages is their raison\nd'e tre, which is why nine\nout of ten mortgages\ncome from them. Furthermore, there are two\nbig advantages in considering a building soc-ie ty. First, you increase\nyour chances of getting\na mortgage by investing\nwith a building society,\neven before you require\na mortgage. These institutions always give preference to their investors\nwhen dealing with mortgage applications, and\nthis is particularly true at\nthose times when money\nis generally in short sup-ply. Creating this kind of\ngoodwill, demonstrating\nyourself to be a reliable\nand financially sound investor\u2014even though the\namounts involved may\nbe small\u2014is of enormous value when you are\nlooking for a mortgage.\nAnd, of course, quite\napart from that, the dividends earned on building\nsociety deposits are\nquite a good investment.\nFinally, there is no\nneed, on a mortgage\ntaken out with a building\nsociety, to buy unnecessary life insurance.\nBut having found\nwhere to get the money,\nthe question naturally arises\u2014how much. Well,\nit's going to depend to\nsome extent on the general economic climate.\nIn good times, you can\nborrow up to three times\nyour annual salary; in\nbad times, about two-and-a half times your\nsalary. And this leads inevitably to the next ques-tion. Where are you going to find the money to\ncover the difference between what you raise on\na mortgage and the actual asking price of the\nhouse you want?\nBE PREPARED\nThe first answer might\nbe a bank, and not\nnecessarily your own. Indeed, in my experience,\nyou'll be better off going\nto your bank's com pet i tors. But whichever you\nchoose, the fundamental\nrule is, in the words of\nthe Boy Scouts, be pre-pared. Don't simply bowl\nalong and ask for a lot\nof money and expect the\nmanager to open the\nsafe for you. You must\npresent your case as a business proposition.\nAny manager will want\nto know the answers to\nthe following questions.\nHow much do you want?\nWhat is the money to be\nused for? How much,\nand over what period,\ncan you afford to repay\nhim? You'll also need\nto find out how much it\nis going to cost you.\nYOU TOO\ncould be President\nMominatmm close\nThursday 1700 hrs\nVoting Fri. and Mon\u00ab,\n24th&27 th November\nAbove all, remember\nthat banks make their\nprofits by lending you\nother people's money.\nPresent a good case,\nand the chances are\nthey'll agree to your re-quest.\nMy second suggestion\nis a deal more tricky,\nperhaps. But it need not\nbe, as long as the proposition is, again, presented on businesslike lines.\nI refer to your parents.\nAll right, you may\nhave an objection to going to the folks to borrow money as a deposit\non your own home, but\nthe chances are that it\ncan be done without\nharm or embarrassment\nto anyone.\nIf your parents own\ntheir own home, the\nbricks and mortar in\nwhich they live are becoming more valuable\nevery day. It's likely they\nhave paid off the mort-gage, or have only a tiny\namount to pay.\nIn either case, they're\nsitting on a gold mine.\nAnd, as long as that property remains just bricks\nand mortar, all the money that it represents is\nsimply dead money. It's not working for them\u2014\nor for you.\nMight it not be worth\ninvestigating the possibility of making it work\nfor you both?\nConsider the facts.\nYour parents own their\nown house. It would be\nvery easy for them to\nraise money on it\u2014sufficient to enable you to\nbuy a house of your own.\nNow, your own house is\nalso appreciating in\nvalue all the time. In two\nor three years, you can\nsell it at a substantial\nprofit, using that to repay your parents and\nstill have enough to put\ndown as a deposit on another house. Any way\nyou look at it, that makes\nsense. Furthermore,\nwhen presented as facts\nand figures, it's not at\nall like going cap in hand\nfor a sub from Mum and\nDad. It can work, and\nI 've seen it work, perfectly amicably and sat-is factor i ly. These, then, are some\nsuggestions \u2014 and remember they are only\nsuggestions, not absolute answers. There are\na number of other ways\nof raising money, but to\ndiscuss them all would\nfill one entire issue of\nFELIX.\nNext term, I shall be\ndealing with this subject\nin greater detail in my\nseries of lectures on insurance and house pur-chase, and that may be\nthe best time and place\nfor me to answer the\nquestions which I hope I have raised.\n\u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3\nIf anyone ever doubted the truth of what I am\nalways saying about the real value of money, they\ncould profitably take a look at the latest government statistics about the purchasing power of the\npound.\nFigures published in October show that inflation\nin the past 15 years has averaged four per cent.\nBut in the last five years, the rate of inflation has\nspeeded up to over seven per cent each year.\nThis is illustrated by a simple table showing what\nthe pound has purchased, taking 1963 as a starting\npoint.\nthe pound worth 100p96.8p92.6p1963:19641965196619671968196919701971197289. 2p87.0p83.3p79.1p75.0 p69.6p62,0p What this means is that, if the rate continues\nover the next 15 years as it did over the last five,\nthe pound sterling will be worth a miserable 33p in 1987. Governments do their best to slow the\npace but even their wildest successes only decrease\nthe rate of inflation\u2014they do not cure it.\n\n"

The Eigeruand, the Matterhorn,\nEverest and the Old Man of Hoy are just a few that\ncome to mind. In a somewhat different sense, Cerro\nTorre has earned a reputation and in many ways a notoriety that attracts publicity and brings mountaineering into the realm of the popular press.\nCerrb Torre is a steep\nand savage mountain peak\nwhich stands just over\n10,000 feet in the remoteness of the Patagonian\nAndes. Despite its rather\nmeagre height, this vicious fang of rock and ice\nhas for some time been\nthe epi to my of the unattainable summit and has\nrecently been at the centre\nof one of the greatest controversies known to the\nmountaineering fraternity.\nIn December 1970, the\nSouth East ridge of Cerro\nTorre was first climbed by\nan Italian party led by\nCasare Maestri, thought\nby many to be Italy's top\nclimber. What put the\nwheels of discontent into\nmotion was that Maestri\nachieved his aim by arming himself with a compressed air drill which he\nhauled up the ridge by\nmeans of a winch in order\nto place no fewer than\nthree hundred expansion\nbolts. In doing this,\nMaestri was heavily criticised by climbers in many\ncountries of the world\nthough few were aware of\nthe extent of his tactics.\nLast winter, an AngloSwiss party led by Leo\nDickinson went out to\nmake the second attempt\non the South East ridge.\nWhat they found was not\nencouraging\u2014the mountain had been reduced to\na debris of ironmongery\nwhich Maestri had initiated in order to facilitate\nhis climbing. Long ladders\nof expansion bolts were in\nplace in holes that had\nbeen artificially drilled in\na manner akin to the bombarding of the rock with\nheavy machine gun fire.\nNot only was the existence of this continuous\nline of artificial aids\ndamning enough in itself\nbut much of it had been\nplaced where the rock\nabounded in natural features which could have\nbeen climbed \"free\". By\nmeans of these tactics,\nMaestri had reduced to\nnothing the element of\nchance which is inherent\nin all good climbing and\nhad taken the limit of\nartificiality beyond its natural limit.\nDickinson's party failed\njust short of the summit\nat a point where Maestri's bolt ladder magically petered out leaving a most\nimpossible looking head-wall of ice apparently un-touched. Dickinson returned to England with amazing evidence of this desecration of the mountain,\nand some doubt was even\nvoiced as to whether\nMaestri, despite everything had actually reached\nthe summit at all.\nTonight (Tuesday) Leo\nDickinson, who is by profession a photographer,\nwill be coming to l.C. to\ngive a talk on Cerro Torre\nillustrated with some 400\nof his most excellent colour slides. The lectures\nwill be in\nLECTURE THEATRE \"A\" \u2014COLLEGE BLOCK\nat 8.00 p.m. \u2014TONIGHT.\nSo whether you're interested in climbing or\njust like seeing exciting\npictures, come along tonight and you will find the\nlecture indeed worth-while.\nTony Cooper\nHon. Sec. I. C.M. C. Welcome to Rag Week!\nYes folks, you read aright, your eyes did not deceive you, Rag Week is here again.\nStarting on 18th November ten days of fun, entertainment and excitement. Minimum\ncharges, maximum pleasure.\nThe aim of Rag this year is to raise money for the following four charities:\nACTION FOR THE CRIPPLED CHILD\nIMPERIAL CANCER RESEARCH FUND\nCOUNTDOWN CAMPAIGN\nKASTUR\nVarious stunts have already taken place on alternate Saturdays of this term, as all\nyou avid followers (if not supporters) of Rag will know.\nOn 7th October 150 members of the tli ree constituent colleges of IC assembled at\nMarble Arch ready with tiddlywinks and collect'ng tins. Objective\u2014tid d ly wink down Oxford\nStreet and Regent Street as far as Eros, and! at the same time to collect as much money\nas possible. On this occasion \u00a3350 was collected for Action for the Crippled Child and Imperial Cancer Research.\nOn 21st October another crowd of eager stunts men, or rather 'chars' equipped with\npans, brooms and loo brushes effected a mass clean and brush up of Oxford Street,\nKnightsbridge and Kensington High Street. In doing so they realised \u00a3260.\nTwo weeks later a competition was organised in which the various departments took\npart, each dept. organising a stunt \u2014 the winner being the one raising the most money.\nAmongst the crazy schemes dreamed up and performed were rolling barrels down Oxford\nStreet, a pedestrian speed trap (unwary passers-by were fined if they were not walking at\nexactly 1\n1 miles per hour) and an escaped 'madman'from a lunatic asylum. From all these\na total of approximately \u00a3500 was raised for charity. The winner was Mining and MinTech 1\nwith their free rides round Trafalgar Square in Clem, who collected \u00a3140.\nLater in the afternoon, a few aspiring 'Guy Fawkes' went along to Westminster and\nattempted to \"blow up\" the Houses of Parliament. Their efforts did not (un surprisingly) go\ndown well with our beloved up holders of peace and law.\nSo far, IC has raised about \u00a31300 . . . can we make it up to \u00a33000 by Christmas?\n********************************************************************^\n-* - . \u2022 x IP; \u201e , \u2022 , \u2022 XI Programme cf Events SATURDAY 18th XX*X x*;X:X!*:* \u2022\n*\u2022\n-X;XX;+X; \u2022*\u2022\n-X'*i*:X; X**: \u2022\nK'1 X*,X XI\n-XXXX XX:XiX XX:XX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX SUNDAY 19th Let Go\nMONDAY 20th TUESDAY 21st WEDNESDAY\nTHURSDAY 23rd FRIDAY 24th SATURDAY 25th SUNDAY 26th TUESDAY 28th3 Legged Pub Crawl\nDisco in the evening\nFilm and Music at l.C.

    "content": "14th November, 1972\nNEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nFREE! ISSUE No. 318\nThe University of London is, to say the least, a complex institution. The changes listed under \"In a Nutshell\" will convey to you that the Murray Committee has recommended some drastic changes to\nUniversity structure\u2014but space in \" Felix\" does not permit us to explain more fully what all the changes\nmean. We have deliberately only printed a list of some of the 199 proposals of the Committee to give\nyou an early insight into the Report\u2014\"Felix\" is the first student newspaper in London to be published\nafter the embargo on the Report came off at 24.00 hrs on Monday night (or 00.00 hrs this morning).\nBlessed along with the rest of the student press in London with advance copies of the Report (only the\nVice-Chancellor saw it before us!) we have instead joined forces with every other member newspaper\nof the London Student Press Association in producing a special newspaper on Murray, which will be on\nthe \" Felix\" news-stands tomorrow morning. This paper will explain more fully the proposals in nice,\nsimple English and without expecting you to already have a working knowledge of the University\nstructure. It will tell you how it affects students, staff, the colleges and the central administration. This\npaper will be free; 20,000 copies are being printed and rushed at top speed to every School of the University. Please try and obtain a copy and read it, because Murray concerns every one of us, and those\nthat come after us.\nOnce again our apologies for not giving the full picture in \"Felix\"', but we are sure that you will\nagree that a joint issue is a better idea. Next week we will be publishing reaction within the College\nand the rest of the University (by arrangement with other member newspapers of the LSPA) on the\nReport\u2014Felix naturally welcomes readers' comments also.\nThe federal system of the University should be\nmaintained.\n* * *\nKing's College and University College should be\nencouraged to apply for their own charters, and thus\nbecome separate universities.\n* * #\nBedford, Queen Elizabeth and Westfield Colleges\nto merge.\nOR\nOne of these to move to Egham and merge with\nRoyal HoIIoway and the other two be merged.\nOR\nJoin Bedford College to University College and\nQueen Elizabeth College to Westfield College and\nexpand Royal Hofioway.\n* * *\nImperial College to be treated in the same way as\nother Schools as regards grants from the University\nGrants Committee.\n* * *\nWye College might join University of Kent if there\nis an expansion of Biological Science there.\nThe Institute of Education may become an independent School of the University if no major changes\nin its function occur as a result of the James Committee's recommendations.\n..v'$** Goldsmith's College sho vJ' d be given independent\nlegal status as a self-governing body but should not\nbecome a school of the University.\nIn a Nutshell\nStudents of the Colleges of Music should have facilities to register as External Students of the University,\nand special arrangements made for their students to\ngo to courses and lectures in the University.\nFacilities to register as external students to students\nof Jews' College: the college should not be made a school of the University.\nThe external examination system for full-time students in public educational institutions to be phased\nout, but to continue for the time being for part-time\nstudents, and also for students in private educational\nestablishments and private students working at home.\n* ,\n$ *\nDrastic limitation of facilities for registration of\nOverseas students as External students.\nInter-collegiate co-operation and rational is ation on\nan academic as well as a financial level to be pro-mote d.*** Fulllest possible participation by academic staff as\nrepresentatives in academic organisation and government of the University.\nI.C. to lose\nUGC grants\naccess\nImperial College will lose its right to go direct to\nthe University Grants Committee for its money if th\u00bb\nMurray Report on the Governance of the University of\nLondon, published today, is implemented.\nAt present, Imperial is treated differently to other\ncolleges of the University, whose grants are determined\nby the Court of the University. Until now, we have gone\ndirect to the UGC independently of other colleges. This\nwas because the Government gave the college national\nresponsibility for the development of scientific and\ntechnological teaching.\nThe report says:\n\"We understand that\nthis treatment (direct access to the UGC) has been\nextended by the University Grants Committee to\nthe end of the 1972-77\nquin que n niu m butt is then\nto be reviewed in the light\nof our Report. Unless\nthere are grounds of Government or University\nGrants Committee policy,\nsuch as were mentioned in\nSir John Wolfenden's letter in 1966, for continuing\nthis treatment, we can, for\nour part, see no special\nreason why Imperial College, as a constituent\nSchool of the University,\nshould be treated differently from the other\nSchools whose grants are\ndetermined by the Court\nof the University.\"\nIt has been on the cards\nfor' some time that this\nrecommendation was\nlikely, and it seems improbable that it will come\nas much of a surprise in\nthe College or University.\nThe system for the obtaining of grants from the\nUGC by the University in\ngeneral will be rational-is ed. At present colleges\nprepare individual sub-missions, send them to\nthe Court who collates\nthem and forwards them\nto the UGC. This will inevitably change with the\nnew Joint Committee of\nSenate and the Court for\nPlanning and Development.\nAt the time of going to\npress (Sunday 8 p.m.) the\nEditor of Felix was the\nonly person in the College to have seen a copy\nof the Report. It\nis not easy to judge what\nthe reaction will be. In\nearly 1971, Judith Walker, then President of\nI.C.U., sent the Murray\nCommittee a strongly\nworded letter saying that\n\"Imperial College fought\nhard for this privilege and\nwould not wish to sacrifice this independent pos i tion.\"\nIn the same letter Miss\nWalker decried the \"cum-ber some, over-bureau cr a tic machinery\" of the\nUniversity and said that\n\"the seemingly unnecessary constraints imposed\nby a federal structure give\nrise to much anti-London\nUniversity feeling.\" She\nsuggested that the most\nimportant recommendation of the enquiry would\nbe an extension of the\nSaunders' Report's philosophy of de federal is ation. However, in the report,\nthe Murray Committee\nsay that \"It is a striking\nfeature . . . that there is\npractically unanimous support for the maintenance\nof the federal system . . .\"\nand they have re com men ded, its continuance.\nStudent representation to be given at Senate and\nBoards of Studies level. Student representatives to\nhave had prior experience of participation in academic affairs at college level, but no student representation on Court at this stage.\nAcademic leadership in the University to be\nachieved by making the Vice-Chancellorship a full-time post, and the Principal to become responsible to\nthe VC as the administrative as well! as the academic\nhead of the University.\n* * *\nAll members of academic staff (including Heads of\nSchools) to be entitled to membership of Convocaticm.\n.* s fc* Boards of Studies to have responsibilities increased!.\nHe** Academic advisory boards to be abolished.\n* $\nPresent system of Senate Councils to be abolished:\nacademic poll icy to become responsibility of new Senate working through subject area committees.\n* *\nfe* Collegiate Council to be reorganised.\n* * *\nCourt to be established as supreme governing body.\n>\n* % *\nSenate to be reconstituted as an academic body.\nCollegiate Council to be reconstituted as an independent body represented on Court and Senate.\n* * *\nConvocation not be represented on the new Senate.\n* * *\nJoint Committee of Court and Senate for Planning\nand Development to be set up.\n\n"

In the five and a half hours between\n10.30 and 4 p.m. that the Council was in session it\nachieved remarkably little.\nThe President's Report\nconcentrated mainly on\naccommodation in the\nLeinster/Camborne and\nHillcrest groups of student hotels, on which she\nand the ULU Accommodation Officer had made a survey, as mandated by\nthe last 'SRC meeting. Joy\nClancy, the President, said\nthat they had found conditions in the hotels satis-factory, and there were\nfew complaints\u2014the ones\nthat they had received\nwere justified.\n\u00a310 per week\nDelegates nearly fainted,\nhowever, when calmly informed that the rent for\nrooms in these hotels was\n\u00a310 per week per person\npartial board. In order to\nimprove communications\nbetween the Union and the\nhotel groups concerned,\nthe meeting made Pat\nDaniels (Bedford) Executive Member with responsibility for Welfare. She\nwill liaise with the hotels\nand pass on complaints .. .\nand see that some action is\ntaken. People living in the\nhotels who are unsatisfied\nare urged to get in touch\nwith her.\nCost of Sleeping\nPete Johns (President of\nUniversity College) proposed a motion that increases in hall fees be tied\nto the notional element in\nthe grant. Although this\nreally only concerns UC,\nwhere they have managed\nto avert an increase in fees\nby rational is ation, it was\npassed without dissent.\nMost, if not all of the colleges in London have hall\nfees lower than the notional element \u2014 this is certainly the case at Imperial.\nGetting a Word in\nEdgeways\nA \"delete all and insert\"\namendment to SRC policy\non Representation was\npassed unanimously. Although seemingly irrelevant, several I.C. amendments making no difference to i the motion, other\nthan adding half-an-hour\nito the discussion, were\naccepted into the motion.\nSRC was then treated\nto a lecture on i he Murray\nReport by Tony Lake,\nwho was the SRC's nominee to sit on the Committee. In view of the embargo until yesterday, he\nwas unable to specifically\nFELIX\nx clu sive state what was in the\nReport, but in his usual\nbrilliant style managed to\ndrop enough hints to give\nmost of his audience a pretty good idea of what\nto expect, without, of\ncourse, giving anything\naway. A model first form,\nCouncil sat and listened to\nteacher without inter rup tion, and in typical first-form style, failed to think\nof any questions to ask at\nthe end, apart from a skilled questioner from Goldsmiths'. Tony managed\nadmirably in long-winded-ly failing to answer what\nquestions there were, and\nexpressed his willingness\nto come to college Union\nMeetings and explain the\nReport when he CAN talk\nabout what's in it\u2014regrettably, perhaps, Imperial\nwill have Joy Clancy,\nPresident of ULU, instead\nat the UGM on Thursday\nweek.\nAn extraordinary meeting (aren't they all?) of\nthe SRC has been called\nfor next Monday to discuss Murray and its im-pli cations. A Felix reporter\nwill be there.\nTHE\nUNION DIRECTORY will\nappear next week whether or not it is\ncomplete. Since it's preferable that it is\ncomplete, please send\ndetails of your club/\nsociety / organisation\n(if not already sent)\nto FELIX at once\u2014\ndeadline 8 pm Wednesday.\nENTS COMMITTEE\nTO FACE CENSURE\nLi\nWe can't go on like this\"\nsays Chairman as Ents reveal\n\u00a3800 profit on term's concerts\nDisband Ents, said ashen-faced Dave Amos at Joint Council. Great\nidea, echoed several members of council who are still here and shall\nremain nameless. Give them another chance, said someone else so\nEnts breathed again and set about making good, last year's slightly-more-than-marginal loss.\nThe Monday before\nFairport Convention were\ndue to play they pulled\nout, and a loss was sustained on their less attractive replacements. The following week Dick Heckstall-Smith was also a flop,\nMAKE TRACKS\nHOME THIS\nWEEKEND!\nThe NUS have made a real achievement in persuading the London Midland and Eastern Region of British\nRail to offer cut-price weekend trips home by train.\nHeralded by the slogan \"Travel without a hitch\"\n(ur rg hh) London Midland Region offers unlimited (well,\nno written limit) tickets to Leicester, Nottingham,\nChesterfield, Sheffield, Coventry, Birmingham, Manchester, Wolverhampton and Liverpool. The tickets are\nvalid for the journey out on Friday afternoon or evening by certain specified trains, with return by just about\nany train on Sunday all day or Monday morning.\nTickets are obtainable from St. Pancras or Euston\nStation (depending on destination) from 6 days before\nyou travel.\nPrices are as follows:\u2014\nSt. Pancras to\nLeicester \u00a31.65\nNottingham \u00a32.00\nChesterfield \u00a32.15\nSheffield \u00a32.40\nEuston to\nCoventry \u00a32.05\nBirmingham \u00a32.15\nManchester \u00a35.00\nWolverhampton \u00a32.15\nLiverpool \u00a34.80\nNegotiations have now also been concluded with\nEastern Region, who from this weekend onwards will\nbe offering 60 seats on trains to Leeds and places en\nroute to the NUS Travel Service: the price is about\n\u00a33.20 return, same terms. However, tickets for these\ntrains should be obtained from the NUS Travel Service\nin Euston Road and not from Kings Cross Station.\nFrom January, there will be 120 seats.\nIt is naturally essential to the success of the scheme\nthat if he trains be used, so if you live in the Midlands,\nand are going home for a weekend, bear it well in mind.\nOh, and don't forget your NUS or International Student\nIdentity Card when applying for tickets\u2014you'll need it.\nLet the train\nfake f om brain I attracting less people than\nthere had been at the previous night's disco. The\nashen face of Dave Amos\nloomed over the commit-tee. However, on October\n21st Lou Reed gave us a profit of \u00a3400, on November 4 the Status Quo concert realised \u00a380, and on\nNovember 11 another \u00a3400\nof the general public's money found its way into\nthe Ents coffers after the\nOsibisa concert. With the\nFriday night disco regularly setting new attendance records the profit so\nfar this year is over halfway towards equalling last\nyear's loss, or to put it another way, if they lose\neight hundred quid over\nthe rest of this year they'll\nstill break even.\n\"We can't go on like\nthis\" complained tight-lipped Ents chairman Paul\nWadsworth. \"The Union\nstill think Ents only makes\nmoney on teensy we ens y concerts which in fact\nalways lose. Give me Led\nBeatles any day.\" RECORD PRICES\nSLASHED\nNew Student Agency\nWhen the new Room at the Toop (RATT) appears\nfrom its wrappers, besides all the commercial ventures\nsuch as Insurance and USK Travel, with high-pressure\nsales methods (they won't like that\u2014Ed.) there will be\nan outsider. A group of second-year students are starting a record agency, where records may be ordered on\nTuesday, Thursday and Friday lunchtimes. to be delivered normally on the following Tuesday.

ALJ ! !\nOn Saturday, November 4, IC made their annual\npilgrimage up the Ml to play Bedford Wanderers\n(2nd XV) and were narrowly defeated by 10 points\nto 8. This was yet another tremendous game for IC,\nconsidering that Bedford are one of the strongest clubs\nin the Midlands. Having won the toss, IC elected\nto play up the slope in the first half and were hoping\nto contain Bedford. This they did with every member\nof the IC team running and covering. It was only a break from the scrum that led to the only score of\nthe first half when the Bedford outside half scored\nwide out \u2014 the conversion failed. Although Bedford\nwon a lot of ball they failed to use it whereas the\nball won by IC was often moved along the line for\nwingers McDonough and Hunt (to make a lot of\nground. So with the Bedford pack tiring at the end\nof the first half, IC turned round reasonably confident\nthat the score could be levelled.\nAt the beginning of the second half, IC press uri sed Bedford into their own 25 but could not find the\nfinal opening to score. An injury to a Bedford player\nleft IC with an additional advantage when he left the\nfield and IC made good use of this. From a line out\nOsborne made the initial break and with Adams\nin support drove to the Bedford 25. The resulting ruc k was won by IC and the ball moved out for Cotter\nto take and feed inside for Smith to crash over. This\ntry was the catalyst IC needed and from another ruc k in the Bedford 25 the ball was moved out to Hunt\nwho scored in the corner.\nBedford, realising they were losing with very little\ntime left (also back to full strength) resorted to \"strong\narm\" tactics and as a result Ian Elenor had to leave\nthe field to have stitches in a cut above the eye. IC\nmanaged to hold on until a late disputed try (the\nball was passed a yard forward) brought the scores\nlevel. The Bedford full back then put in a magnificent\nkick from the to uc b line to win the game. This final\ntry left IC sick as they had worked hard enough to\nat least gain a draw. It was, as Bruce might say, \"A bag o's***\" Team: D. Rimmer, M. Cotter, R. Stern, J. McDonough (Capt.), A. James, C. Flanagan, I. Elenor, P. Ranson, B. Bradley, R. Matthews, A. Walton, D. Osborne, M. Adams. ;\nScorers: TRIES: Hunt, Smith.\nOn Wednesday, November 8, IC played LSE away\nand won by 15 points to 3. LSE loudly proclaimed\nat a meeting earlier in the term that they were the best\nteam in UL this year but as can be seen from the\nresult 15 people at IC disagree with that statement.\nThe game was a repeat of the Gutteridge Cup Final\nlast season and was therefore a hard fought match.\nBruce had to be spoken to by the referee but this\nhad no bad effect on either side and several punches\nwere thrown, but IC still scored all the points. The\nfirst try came when the ball was moved to Cotter who\ncut in to touch down \u2014 Rimmer converted and also\nkicked a penalty later on in the first half. A penalty\nunder the posts awarded to LSE brought the interval\nscore to 9\u20143.\nAfter the Interval James decided he'd 'had enough\nand flaked but it made little or no difference to IC,\nwith Matthews expertly reshuffling the hacks considering he is a2nd row forward. IC held out and\nlate on increased their lead when Adams sold a dummy and went over for a try which Rimmer con-verte d. The final whistle was soon after, LSE somewhat de moral is ed considering their earlier boast.\nAs it was McDonough's21st birthday the Marloes\nrun was undertaken with James slowing the pace\ndown or being carried depending upon whether or\nnot the lads were thirsty. Naturally McDonough got\ndrunk, but then so did everyone else so he was not\nalone and a good night was had by all.\nTeam: D. Rimmer, J. Hunt, M. Cotter, R. Stern,\nN. Osborne, A. James (for one half only), C. Flanagan, B. Bradley, P. Ranson, C. Wrigley, R. Matthews\n(Capt.), A. Smith, M. Adams, D. Osborne, A. Walton.\nScorers: TRIES Cotter, Adams; CONV Rimmer\n(2); PEN Rimmer.\nPS All rumours that McDonough is now orbiting the\nearth and Hames has gone deaf following the Bonfire\nparty at Harrington are false!\nFootball Golf\nOn Saturday, November 4, IC visited Birkbeck\nat Greenford. Expecting a hard game the IC side\nstarted at a great pace and although Birkbeck hit\nthe bar early on, the first half was generally dominated\nby IC. After several near misses, the visitors went\nahead through Billy Milne following good work by\nAlan Williams who seems to enjoy making life difficult for centre-halves. From the start of the second\nhalf it was apparent that the IC team had dropped\ndown a couple of gears and Birkbeck began to control the game. It was some time before the opposition\ntook advantage of -their control, and when they did\nit was predictably their centre-forward who scored,\nafter some hesitancy in the IC defence. Even the\n\"shock\" of this goal failed to stir IC although it\nworked wonders for Birkbeck who had several more\ngood attempts before being awarded a suspiciously\noffside goal. This second goal had the reverse effect of\nthe first and although IC never really dominated the\ngame they came back strongly. Birkbeck had trouble\nin deciding with corner kicks and from two of these\nByron Smith and Billy Milne went close with volleys.\nAs the game progressed, IC seemed less and less\nlikely. Then with about five minutes to go a long\nball out of IC's defence found the Birkbeck centre-half who rose magnificently above Alan Williams to\nhead past his own 'keeper.\nAlso on Saturday, the 3rd team travelled to the\nNational College of Food Technology and although\nthe game was boring (an easy 5\n\u2014\n1 win) the food afterwards is reported to have been superb, and since that\nis the only reason the 3rd's went to NCFT (guess who\nthe fixture secretary plays for) everyone was quite\nhappy.\nWednesday, November 8 was not a good day for\nIC. The first team played very poorly and allowed\nUC to rush them instead of using the large Harlington\npitch to better advantage. Thefirsthalf was only saved\nfrom being a total disaster by UC's inability to shoot\nstraight. The second half was slightly better, bul t even\nso only Gerwyn Edwards and Alan Williams played\nas though they wanted to win.\nImperial were fortunate to go ahead when Alan Williams was needlessly knocked down. Pete Lonnen\nconverted the spot kick with no trouble. This goal\nbrought IC back into the game and when Pete Lonnen\nhad beaten most of the UC team and was just about\nto send a scorching drive into the far top corner (or\nso he tells me) he too was chopped down. Pete then\nmade it 2\u20140 and a UC player left the field for expressing dissent (that's putting it mildly).\nStill at Harlington the 2nds lost to UC II for the\nfirst time for years. Leading 2\u20140 at one time the\ntraditionally strong 2nd team defence apparently made\na hash of the rest of the game. The thirds were held\nto a2 \u20142 draw by UC HI and since last week they\nbeat UC II they have made a good start to their league\nprogramme.\nAt Shenley the 4th drew 1\n\u2014\n1 with UC IV and the\n5th, with only 10 men, went down 3\u20141. Rob Carty's Circus Team (the fj th s) provided another nail biting\nfinish in beating QEC III by 7\n\u2014\n-6 (they still haven't cured that defence, but what a forward line!).\nThe IC Golf Club plays at the Royal Mid-Surrey\nClub at the Old Deer Park, Richmond (in Kew Gardens, opposite Richmond tube).\nThe cost is a nominal subscription to the IC Club\nplus a charge of 25p per round to Mid-Surrey \u2014 the\nonly restriction being Monday to Friday play only.\nThe membership is restricted to 25 by Mid-Surrey but\nthere are still plenty of vacancies.\nTo establish a flourishing club with fixtures and\ncompetitions throughout the year these places must be\nfilled.\nIf you are interested, please contact S.

Lacrosse Club\nlast Saturday, brought them even nearer to clinching\nthe SEMLA League Title (3rd division!). ICI dominated the game from the face and a5 goal blitz in the\nfirst quarter showed the true goal-scoring potential of\nan experienced (?) forward line. The result appeared\nto be a formality until a3 goal flourish from the Lee\nteam destroyed IC's complacency in the last quarter.\nHowever, the defence managed to regain control of\nthe situation and inspired by the midfield's example,\nheld out to ensure that the Imps maintained their 100\nper cent record in the league with a final score of\n11-4.\nPostscript \u2014 The captain disclaims all responsibility\nfor the above report, obviously written by a couple of\nego-tripping forwards!\nsmall\nads AERO 2 proudly announce\nthe engagement of John\nChitty (Aero 2, would you be-li eve) of Sheffield, Yorks.,\nto Judy Blair of Cardington,\nBeds, (oops! sorry, Freudian\nslip), Bedfordshire.\nARE you a red-blooded male\nor female?
