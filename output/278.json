    "content": "Page 2 FELIX 22nd May, 1969\nCOMMENT\nUniversities are not the only established British institutions\nto have felt the pressures of the country's economic situation.\nBut it could well be that these pressures will have the most\nprofound effect on our Universities. These pressures have\nforced people to discuss once again what is meant by the\nphrase \"academic freedom\". At the LSE the fur ore over the\nsacking s of two lecturers, for their political beliefs and\nsayings, has brought this discussion to the fore. Those\npresent at the Select Committee's hearings at IC last week\nwill also have been reminded of this issue.\nChallenges to Academic Freedom\nBasically the challenges to academic freedom can be traced\nto two different pressure groups. The first, the combined\neconomic power of the government and industry, is concerned\nwith the cost-effectiveness of the University. As a country\nwith its back against the wall in economic terms we must, as\nEdward Short put it last January, \"become increasingly aware\nof the demands of the economy . . . .\". Universities should\ngo into production, they must become more efficient degree\nproducers, more relevant researchers and they will only\nattract Government investment to the extent that they do\njust that. Naturally this means a great loss in freedom;\nacademic studies and lines of research which are merely\ninteresting will be threatened by lack of money and probably\ndropped, outside of Oxbridge with its great inherited wealth.\nThe second pressure group consists of dissatisfied students\nand junior staff, because, as our Rector put it in his evidence\nto the Select Committee, the administration of a University\nor College is based on \"consent\". However, as pressures on\nthe university become stronger and the acquiescence of\nstudents to antiquated and often unjust systems becomes\nweaker, the rule of consent is breaking down since some\npeople don't consent. The tragedy is that when the rule of\n\"consent\" does break down the authoritarian nature of University is revealed. For people who for one reason or another\ndo not \"consent\" there is precious Uttle freedom. Lord\nPenney suggested that the alternative would be an immense\nbureaucratic structure.\nSeparation of Powers\nLet us consider this second pressure first, because this\nthreat to academic freedom can be solved by the University\nitself. Are the Rector's two alternatives of benevolent dictatorship or a Civil Service pyramid the only ones? The\nAmerican constitution enshrines another principle of government\u2014 the separation of powers. The executive, representatives and judiciary were in theory set apart as independent counter balancing forces. Why not set up the students,\nstaff and administration as independent, equal yet self-reliant\npowers? Thus if the rule of consent does break down there\nwould be a definite but not authoritarian structure to resolve\ndifferences. But more important still, such differences would\nbe solved justly.\nResearch DeFormed\nThe problems of deformation of research by the profit\nmotive have previously been described in FELIX 275, whereby lines of research are followed up irrespective of the ii academic value, or value to mankind. In some places in\nthis college research is even carried out for the armed forces\nand weapons establishments; for instance Chemistry and\nChemical Engineering departments carry out apparently innocuous projects for such organisations. However, some of\nthis research is still classified; some work for the US Army,\ncompleted in 1962, on thermals was carried out in the\nMeteorology department. Colonel R.K. Sasce was the U.S. representative and the project is still known under the secret\nCombaret number DA\u201491\u2014591\u2014EUC\u20141707. It is difficult\nto see how Universities can retain their traditional freedom\nwhile accepting money from such sources.\nThe affects of these economic pressures are now being\nrealised by undergrads too. By all means we can have nontechnical studies, provided they are management studies;\nbut genuine course-broadening is rejected. Thus courses\nbecome more and more narrowly vocational; the government\nhas no money to spend on real education, training \"the whole\nman for the whole life\" is replaced by training the technologist\nthe country \"needs\". If that is so let students serve notice\non the government that the parsimonious grant we get now\nis because we are allegedly being educated; if we are merely\nbeing trained then we will demand a wage suitable to such\nan apprenticeship. Now is the time to stand up to Treasury\nand say \"You can't have your cake and eat it.\"\nCARNIVAL FETED HELP NEEDED\nThe I.C. Carnival Fete\nwas greeted by heavy rain\nthroughout the morning, as\nJez left to tour the area, but\nnevertheless a profit of at\nleast \u00a3100 was made, with\nreported takings of \u00a3180. Il\nis still to be revealed whether\nthe rainfall was beyond the\nlimit required to cause the\ninsurance to be paid, but the\nweather certainly spoilt the\nevent, causing the clock-golf\nto be called off along with\nthe ten-pin bowling. Of an\nexpected 40 stalls, only 26\nwere set up, twelve of these\nbeing run by the Anglican\nChaplaincy, who raised \u00a3100.\nRita Tushingham opened\nthe fe te, despite the weather,\nand the group Smile enter-tai ned, apparently a little too\nnoisily, causing the local\npolice to intervene.\nAmong the individual\nstunts, the soak - MartinBland (etc.) trick brought in\n\u00a32 10s., much to their dis-comfort, and Mr. Seaford\ncollected \u00a39 with Find the\nLady. Thus, in spite of maintenance charging \u00a330 for putting up the stage, and the\nfact that the bandstand was\nnot to be used, the fe te did\nsucceed financially.\ni ilp ll lili lB p* is\"\nIS% i Dermott Corr, about to give everyone a soaking\nat the Carnival Fete.\n\"IDIOTIC\" CHALLENGE\nSir,\nI am sick and tired of having my time wasted by idiotic quorum challenges at\nUnion meetings.\nA quorum is intended as\nthe last defence against unrepresentative opinion acting\nin the name of the Union.\nIt is surely more ethical, especially when one has indicated one's concern for representative debate by suggesting a deferment of the\nmain business to allow more\npeople to arrive, not to challenge unless clearly minority\nviews are being implemented and all other courses of\naction are exhausted. The\nquorum is not meant to give\nthe power of veto over a measure that one is opposed\nto, as it appeared to be\nused (once again) on Tuesday, when not only were the\nproposals in question already\napproved once by a quo rate meeting, but also a further\ndeferment was available by\nmoving the adjournment.\nFurther interesting speculation is available on the\nreasons why this great believer in representative participation should have acted\nto prevent election of next\nyear's president which would\nhave been possible had the\nconstitutional changes received a second reading. He\ncannot soberly (sic) claim\nthis time even to presume\nto have acted for the major-it y. The most charitable conclusion is that, alone in 265,\nhe was unaware of the implications of his action, a general conclusion that applies also to certain other\nregular quorum-challengers.\nYours,\nP. Lee.\nPhysics 2.\nThis year sees a change\nin the organisation of the\nCarnival Charity with the\nelection of the Co-or d in at or and charity in the summer term. The idea behind\nthis is so that Carnival may\nbe in full swing by the beginning of next session. As\na result of this it is essential\nthat the Carnival committee\nhas been formed before the\nend of this term.\nIn past years, Carnival\nhas suffered from the fact\nthat no enough people from\nthe previous year have been\ninterested enough to con-tin ue; however it is hoped\nthat a nucleus from this\nyear's committee will want\nto help Carnival again next\nsession. Of course there is\nstill plenty of room for newcomers and applications for\nthe following positions are\ninvited : Secretary, Treasurer, Raffle Organiser, Carnival Queen competition or-gan is er, Fete organiser, Arts\nWeek organiser and Publicity officer. In particular, it\nis essential that we have an\nexperienced Publicity Officer.\nThis is in fact not a fully\ncomprehensive list of the\npeople required, as each individual event organiser will\nneed a great deal of help.\nIn past years Carnival\nhas relied upon Vice Presidents and Year Reps to promote interest in Carnival\nbut the next session will see\nthe introduction of a Carnival Rep system where each\nyear will have a rep who will\nbe solely responsible for his\nyear's collection efforts.\nAny persons interested in\nworking for Carnival in any\ncapacity should contact me\nthrough the Union office.\nCarnival Co-or d in at or elect.\nDave Hobman,\nCarnival Co-ordinated Elections\nThe election for next year's Carnival co-or d in at or was\nheld on May 12th. Dave\nHobman, proposed by Sue\nLowin, defeated Frank Ball,\nproposed by retiring coordinator Ian Jarvis, in a friendly tussle. Dave Hobman\nwas active in organising the\nfe te( reported on this page)\nwith the president's wife.\npill ll ll ll lil ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll lli mill ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll l MI President's Pie\nThe next visit of the University Grants Committee to the\nCollege, in about a year's time, is now providing a focus\nfor the work of the committee looking into the growth of\nImperial College. The lack of further sites in South Kensington prevents any wholesale expansion of the College,\nand present estimates suggest a total student population\nof about 5,000 by 1980, including 400 members of the\nArchitectural Association. Major candidates for growth are\nthe interdepartmental studies, with the possibility of an\nundergraduate course in Materials Science, a post-graduate\ncourse in Materials Technology, and more work on BioEngineering at a postgraduate level. Other suggestions include the growth of the Management Studies group, and a new International Institute of Theoretical Physics.\nIdeas are being developed for broadening present courses\nby allowing the interchange of departments in undergraduate\ncourses and by the introduction of non-technical subjects.\nThis coincides with the report of a survey carried out by\nthe student members of the Sociological Studies Committee,\nwhich shows a very large demand for non-technical courses\nat IC. Almost all of the thousand students who replied\nwanted some broader courses and over three-quarters wanted\nthose courses to form part of the degree. Although the\nbiggest demand was for the more directly relevant subjects\nsuch as economics and logic, many people asked for these\ncourses in order to provide a broader education.\nA start has already been made in giving these courses,\nparticularly in the Engineering departments, but the demand\nhas grown much stronger over the last few years. The problems of space in the College make it difficult to provide all of\nthese courses on a large scale, but the present system of\nimporting lecturers from other colleges could be used, at\nleast as a temporary measure. If the system is to be introduced on a college-wide basis, then the best solution might\nbe to set aside two or three hours a week, and allow students\nto choose their option irrespective of department or year.\n\n"

    "content": "Page 6 FELIX 22nd May, 1969\nGENIUS AND MADNESS by John SpI saw a film the other\nday which lasted four hours\n\u2014 excluding intermission \u2014\nwhich had zero script and\na minimum of chronological order. Now, the only\nplace in London which is\nassured an audience for such\na film is the National Film\nTheatre but the point of\ncriticising it is that it is\nshortly to be given an \"ex-peri mental\" run on a more\ncommercial basis. Thus I thought it humane to give\nthe guinea pigs an inkling of\nwhat they're in for.\nIt's a French film \u2014 no\none in this country or\nAmerica would have the\nnerve to try this one on the\npublic. It's called \"Mad\nLove\" (L 'Amour Fou) and\n<\nt could be said that its\ncommercial appeal ends\nwith the title. Jacques\nRivette, the director, knows\nall about controversy through the previous film\n\"Paris, Nous Appartient\".\nIn Paris they're still arguing\nabout the film's commercial\nviability and Rivette himself walks the slender line\nbetween genius and madness.\nWhat has been attempted\nin \"L 'Amour Fou\" is obvious enough. Someone has\nsimply set out to make a film which follows the breakdown of a marriage. That's so simple to have been done\ncountless times before. This\nfact has obviously forced\nRivette to find a new setting,\na different light for an age-old story. He does it by\nmingling fact, pure fact,\nwith fiction \u2014 but his fiction is by no means pure,\nbecause the actors, unrestricted by a script or preconceived ideas, are giving\nvent to their emotions and\ntorments just as they would\nif faced by reality.\nSebastian and Claire are\na young married couple. He\nis a play producer who is\nworking on a production of\nRacine's \"Andromaque\" \u2014\nshe plays Andromaque and\nis being upset by the constant intrusion of TV\ncameras which are following\nthe development of the production for a documentary\non the difficult rehearsals.\nFair enough. But Jean-Pierre\nKalfou, who plays Sebastian\nis a producer and way rehearsing the play for a formal performance. Also,\nFrench TV did film him at\nwork. In fact the only contrived thing about the whole\nof Rivette's film is the relationship of Sebastian and\nClaire and in the light of the\ncomplete authenticity of the\nrest of the film one wonders\njust how contrived that was!\nThe effect on the audience is\ncertainly d is orientating. The\nconstant presence of TV THE CATCH Yossarian is the main\ncharacter.\nThe book begins with him\nand ends with him, and\naround him revolve all the\nother characters; Generals,\nMajors, pilots, whores and\nall the other strange people\nwho make up the cast of one\nof the most extraordinary\nbooks to have been written\nin the past few decades.\nBut Yossarian is not the\ncharacter the book is about,\nhe is the readers' guide\nthrough the maze of human\nrelationships woven by\nJoseph Heller in CATCH\n22, reissued by Corgi Books\nat 7/-.\nBriefly, the plot concerns\nan American airforce division based on the island of\nPianosa, a few miles from\nthe Italian coast. The pilots\nthere are required to complete a certain number of\nmissions before being allowed to return to America.\nAs soon as they complete\nthese missions, the number is\nraised by the Colonel in\ncharge, and they have to fly\nanother five or ten missions.\nAnd so it goes on. Slowly\nthe number of pilots de-creases, and the number of\nmissions rises.\nMost of the action takes\nplace at the camp on\nPianosa (where Yossarian\nshares a tent with a dead\nman called Mudd) but the\nscene Changes periodically\nto Rome, the Eternal city,\nwhere the pilots go on leave,\nand the book contains a description of the Italian\ncapital which must be one of\nthe most compelling pieces\nof writing ever produced.\nIt is difficult to explain\nthe exact meaning of the\ntitle since it seems open to\nas many interpretations as\nthere are characters; but an\nexample of its application\ngives its general meaning:\nOrr is one of Yossarian's friends. Orr is mad, he must\nbe mad to go on so many\nmissions and always crash-land in the sea on the return\nto Pianosa. Obviously, if he\nis mad he can be sent home,\naway from the war, the\nescape all the pilots crave\nfor. All he has to do is sign\na form for the camp psychiatrist and he would be\nfree. But if he is able to fill in\na form, how can he be mad?\nSo if he fills the form in, he\ncannot be certified insane,\nand if he does not, well, he\nis insane but will not be sent\nhome. That's the catch.\nCatch 22. Just how Orr\ncircumvents the problem is\na story in itself, but it seems\nto be preferable to be crazy\nif you are forced to live in\na crazy society, as all the\nsupposedly sane characters\ndiscover.\nThe story does not follow\nany set chronological order,\nbut moves back and forth as\neach character is described\nin detail, from Milo Minderbinder, who is engaged in\ntrying to sell chocolate\ncovered cotton to the troops,\nand occasionally bombs his\nown airfield, to a fourteen-year-old Italian girl who is\nintent on Yossarian's death.\nIt is intensely funny on the\nsurface, but behind the\nintricate web of dialogue and\ndescription, there lies something important. CATCH 22\nis about people, all the unbelievable characters are as\nhuman and three-dimensional as any living person;\nit is about how a society\ncan try to control an individual if the individual is\nnot careful to avoid it. The\nnew cover shows a man\nstaring belligerently at the\nreader; the previous cover\ncontained a silhouette of a man shouting his defiance at\neverything.\nBut the book, as I said,\nis not strictly about Yossarian; it is about a character who is dead before the\nstory opens, a gunner, Snowden. When Yossarian finds\nSnowden on the floor of the\nrear gun-turret, yOu find\nwhat the book is really\nabout.\nRead it.\ncameras in front of the\nmovie cameras give you the\nimpression that this film was\nmade almost by someone,\nyourself, simply looking at\nthe action.\nThe pace is naturally un-hurried, even sluggish \u2014 but\nmuch of life is that way anyhow and it gives the director the opportunity to explore the very plexus of life\nand love in great detail. But\nabove all the format gets\nyou involved by the sheer\nphysical weight of the film's length and, just as most\npeople would get to know a person pretty well after four\nhours of one sided con versa tion, so the characters of\n\"L 'Amour Fou\" p rise themselves into your sentiments\nby brute force alone.\nThere are lots of other\ntricks to throw you off\nbalance. The domestic\nscenes between Claire and\nSebastian which, throughout\nthe film, span the whole\nvista of human emotions\nfrom passion, through insanity and suicide, to murder itself, are filmed in\ncrisply textured 35 mm film.\nThe play scenes are shot in\n16 mm and then blown up\nfor 35 mm projection. The\nresult is to give half the film\namu zz y, detached quality\nwhich, by its almost paranormal texture lends fiction\nto the reality which is before\nthe camera. Conversely, the\nsharply defined 35 mm parts\nappear only too real whilst\nbeing the only contrived part\nof the film.\nHaving said that you'll\nwonder what's wrong. All I can say is, if anyone goes to\nsee this film they would be\nwell advised firstly, to read\n\"Andromaque\", and second-ly, to speak French. At the\nNFT the sound came via an\ninterpreter over earphones\u2014\nthe gentleman sounding a Utile blot to and managing\nto translate about a quarter\nof the dialogue. This was\nonly because the proper\nsoundtrack for the film is on\ntape which had not arrived\nfrom Paris. The public might\njust get the real thing. It's sad also that any film re-qui riesa little work from\nthe audience, but the work\nhere is so inextricably tied\nto Racine's \"Andromaque\"\nthat ignorance of that particular play, and it was my\nmisfortune to have been and\nto remain so, certainly takes\nsome of the essence away.\nHowever, for its originality\nof conception \"L 'Amour\nFou\" is a very great film\nindeed and I for one shall\nbe fascinated to see how the\npublic take it \u2014 especially\nwith a decent soundtrack.\nYou have enough\nto worry about* So we don't ask for bank charges*\nThe biggest cloud on the horizon for a student (apart from examinations) is\nmoney. A grant is difficult to live on.\nSo Lloyds Bank doesn't ask for bank\ncharges on student accounts, provided\nthe account is always in\ncredit. We can also give\nfree advice on how to\nmanage your financial affairs. Why not talk to the Manager\nof your nearest branch of\nLloyds Bank? He'd be delighted\nto see you.\nBank\n\n"

They are members of the Anglican Chaplaincy,\none of several religious organisations operating\namong I.C. students. If you believe (or sincerely\nhope) that the answer is yes, at the foot of the\npage Simon Cotton answers criticism of the Anglican Chaplaincy and religious organisation.\nCOMPLACENCY\nThe chalice pictured above is a religious emblem,\na symbol appealing to Christian emotions. In\nanswering the questions below, Simon Cotton\ncompares the validity of beliefs based on intellect\nand on emotions. Questions by Ian Carr, who is\nsick of having John Donne quoted at him.\nPhotographs by Simon Cotton and Malcolm Cresser\nPossibly the most remarkable thing about the Anglican Chaplaincy in I.C. is its\nvery size. In an age when, so\nwe are told, science disproves\nreligion, nearly 10 per cent\nof the students are regular\ncommunicants. The purpose\nof this article is to describe\nthe activities of the Anglican\nmovement within the college\nin both the spiritual and\n\" secular \" contexts.\nJust as the Chaplaincy\nwithin I.C. is composed of a number of groups within\nHalls and Departments, so is\nit part of a bigger body, the\nWest London Chaplaincy,\nwhich includes other colleges\nin the area; moreover it embraces both students and\nnon-students such as Lady\nPenney, whom we are happy\nto welcome in our midst.\nMany members of the various colleges meet up at the\nSunday services, at present\nheld in St. Augustine's, Queen's Gate, but they also\nmeet in other ways, such as\nin prayer groups, study\ngroups, discussion groups,\nand in the great act of Eucharistic worship in Hall or\nDepartment.\nPoverty, Hunger, Alcoholism, Mental Health, Personal\nRelationships, Marriage\u2014\nthese matters of importance\nto Christian and non-Christ-ian alike are discussed with\npeople working in these\nfields. Worship does not end\nat the \"church door\" but\nshould extend to secular\nactivities (faith without works\nis dead). Members of the\nChaplaincy are active in a wide range of college societies and usually take a large\npart in running the Carnival\nFete. It is a tribute to the\nsmall group of people directly concerned with raising the\nmoney that over \u00a3900 will go\nto a Mission Hospital in Tanzania. Cathy Limming, an\noccupational therapist working at a leprosy centre near\nMadras; Jeremy Sammes, recently returned from Guyana,\nRichard Smith, who works\nwith down-and-outs in the\nEast End (see FELIX 276)\nthese are but three members\nwho give voluntary service.\nThe greatest contribution\nthat the Chaplaincy made to\ncollege life in the past year\nwas perhaps the visit of the\nArchbishop of Canterbury in\nearly February. For many\nyears the Chaplaincy has run\nthe \"Teaching Week\" in\nFebruary; the structure of the\nweek is based on several\nevening talks by an eminent\nChristian, formal discussions,\nprayer groups, Eucharists and\ncoffee parties. The events of\nthe week have already been\nreported in such widely differing organs as FELIX and\nthe Church of England Newspaper. Probably the greatest\nimpression received by the\nArchbishop's audiences (run-ning into hundreds) was of\nhis warm humanity and his\nawareness of current problems. The interested non-Christ-ian must be able to see the\nHoliness and Glory of God\nreflected in the members of\nhis Church; no one can be\nexpected to become committed to Christ after a first introduction to the Church and\nwe welcome in our midst\nthose who are vaguely inter-este d, those who do not wish\nto become \" involved \", the\nirregular attenders, etc. It is\nup to the leaders of the\nChurch to set those people\nan example by their personal qualities. The Church\nis not a closed shop\u2014a fact\nit can be easy for us all to\nmiss\u2014and the time to worry\nwill be When the interested\nnon-Christians feels his interest is longer welcomed.\nThe spiritual needs of the\nChaplaincy are administered\nby two Chaplains, Ron Diss\nand Ivor Smith-Cameron,\nwho both inhabit aged vicarages in West London; the\namount of work they perform\nis truly phenomenal. With\nsuch a large body, communication is largely maintained\nthrough the frequent leaders\nmeetings and the weekly\nnewsletters CHI-RHO which\ntakes its name from the\nmonogram of the first two\nletters of the Greek for\nChrist\u2014the lab arum, the oldest Christian emblem.\nThe most recent attempt\nto integrate the Chaplaincy\ninto the society it serves has\nbeen the \"Secular Masses\"\nas they might be termed,\nwhich have been held in\nMech. Eng. foyer; last November 10 people were confirmed by the Bishop of Kensington at one of these ser-vices. And so, day by day,\nthe Church in Imperial College moves onwards, a living\nexample of what Christianity\ncan mean to students in the\n20th Century.\nFather Ivor at a Tizard Hall Breakfast\n(a) The vision I have of the Anglican Chaplaincy is as a self-satisfied complacent organisation, content in its \" goodness \" and \" belief \" without coming within a mile's distance\nof understanding what people are. How do you see it?\n(b) The Chaplaincy seems to me to be one of the worst\nexamples of how church dogma in university takes over from\nreligious mum bo jumbo in schools, ensnaring fresher s as they\narrive and not letting them have a chance to live with a religion but without a religious organisation.\n(c) Do you not think there is a case for leaving people alone\nin their disbelief s, even if they are unhappy, on the grounds\nthat they may have no wish to live in a community? Why\nthe great urge to convert lapsed Christians, some of whom\nmay be happier since giving up Christian organisations ?\nLeave people alone\u2014are they not the most important thing\nof all, more important than any God ?\n(d) Chi-Rho appeals to the most saccharin aspects of man's nature, living in an everything s great-in-God's garden imaginary world of its own. Why not something more realistic ?\n(e) Finally, on general Christian ideals, just what has Christianity got to offer to people who are no good to anyone,\nhave nothing to offer and don't want to offer it, people who\ndon't want to be interfered with in any way and above all\nhate being pitied by clockwork Christians ?\nYour two main criticisms of the Chaplaincy seem to be\n(a) that it has no respect for the sanctity of the individual\nand (b) that it appeals to the emotions and not to the\nintellect.\nA Christian must always have respect of the individual\nas that individual is made in the image of God (whether\nthat individual realises it or not). Christians, not only in I.C., often fail in this by treating the individual not as a person\nbut as a subject ripe for conversion ! Yet, as John Donne\nput it, \" No man is an Island, entire of itself! every man is\na piece of the continent, a part of the main \". We all live in\nthis world and must respond to the challenge it provides;\nit is the duty of Christians to speak out on matters of\nnational importance, just as much as it is their duty to respect\nthe being of the individual.\nDoes the Chaplaincy appeal wholly to the emotional ?\nIt is not wrong to appeal to the emotions which are, after\nall, part of ourselves, provided that the emotions are not\ntreated as the whole of man. The profusion of discussion\ngroups surely gives the lie to the point that there is not\nenough rational discussion\u2014I would say however that there\nare times when one must look closely at one's own beliefs\nand see how clearly one is sticking to them. The Christian\nseeks to follow the ideal of Christ but he must see himself\nas falling a long way short of that ideal.\nGod preserve the Chaplaincy from being the self-satisfied,\ncomplacent organisation as you term it! The Church does\nnot exist for its own edification but for the benefit of those\noutside. If we lose sight of this we cease to be true Christians. As for the Chaplaincy ensnaring fresher s etc., it is no\nmore guilty of this than any other college society on\nFreshers' day !\nYou give the impression that CHI-RHO is pushed under\nyour door (if not down your throat) every week! Have you\nread it seriously\u2014in this week's issue, there are thoughts on\ncolour discrimination, and appeals for people to collect for\nChristian Aid Week and to help Richard Smith in his East\nEnd mission during the summer vac.\u2014this is hardly taking\nan unrealistic view of the world. However, let us not lose\nsight of the fact that altruistic giving is not what it should\nbe\u2014if giving does not represent a sacrifice then it is not\ngiving.\nWhat has Christianity to offer anyone? It gives them a reason for living.\n(I should like to make it clear that the answers to the\nabove questions represent my personal opinions\u2014Simon\nCotton.)\n\n"

Most people\nhave a contradictory attitude towards it which probably stems\nfrom ill-definition. Bureaucracy is, approximately, \"a body\nof officials (bureaucrats) who, according to some set of rules\nor 'norms', carry out their tasks of communicating, usually\nin a non-critical and non-decisive way, often involving paper-work, between various parts of a bureaucracy.\"\nMost of us have come face to face with bureaucracy, be\nit the obstinate, mindless, delaying, slow, unfeeling motions\nof officialdom as practised by many local governments, or the\ncrazy convulsions of a delirious, mad, soft-sell(?) ad machine\nlike the Reader's Digest. Such experiences must make us\nwonder how the mind of a 'perfect' bure a crat works, so let us\nexamine some pictures.\nWires or Dustbins?\nBureaucrats (Bs) have, or are indoctrinated to have, a certain way of thinking. They see the world as built up by a large number of independent entities\u2014a series of isolated\ncardboard boxes\u2014not overlapping, perhaps enclosing each\nother but nevertheless separate. Each box is some organisation or thing or problem, e.g. a government department, a person, 'the starving millions', etc. Some boxes may be joined\nup by a communication wire which is operated by a faithful\nbureaucrat who conveys messages. Whether or not the\nbureaucrat sees any boxes joined up really depends on\nwhether or not he sees any 'channels' of communication\nbetween them. Ratiocinative (often scientific) people tend\nto categorize things so that categories\u2014i.e. boxes depends\non words and is thus language dependent. So we see the\nbureaucrat iz ation of a person is language dependent.\nUsing a similar picture idea we see that un bureaucrats( UBs) tend to think, from the point of view of Bs, in a confused way. Everything is a kind of big mess (dustbin\nmind'?!) of blobs and lumps which are all joined on to each\nother. The name of a lump describes some approximate\nregion which is fused onto another region (each region being\nsomething to do with an organisation or thing, etc.) Everything is part of some big thing\u2014everything.\nIt would be a good idea to say that Bs and UBs are not\nabsolute pictures but merely ends of a scale\u2014rather like tidiness and order (see FELIX, Spring 1968) are very different\nends of a scale.\nHaving drawn pictures of Bs and UBs, let us see what\ntendencies they might be prone to. A poet (?) once said:\n\" . . . . Language limits thought, destroys totality,\nWord-thoughts fragment concepts . . . .\".\nWe can see from the above discussion that the Bs word-description and categorization of the world does indeed cause\nthe totality of the world to become broken\u2014a name makes\na box which is separate from other boxes, concepts which also\ninvolve a certain wholeness become similarly fragmented.\nThis poses a question, not to be discussed here.\nLanguage fragments concepts, but can concepts exist without language?\nSince Bs think of everything as being basically unconnected it may be easy for aB to hold contradictory views\nwhen failing to see the interconnected ness of things\u2014which\nbrings us to 'double-think'. Orwell defines: \"Double-think\nmeans the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously and accepting both of them.\" We are\nsaying that Bs are prone to Double-think\u2014and of course\nDouble-think was in fact upheld and continued by virtue of\na rigidly bureaucratic state\u2014which made people think of\nworlds of cardboard boxes.\nWe might expect that UBs are less prone to Double-think\nthan Bs because their thoughts (according to the picture) are\nmore part of a whole even if they do not have so many\nthoughts as Bs.\nPB or NBs?\nIf we agree that Bs are prone to Double-think does it\nmean that all Bs are bad? The word 'Bureaucrat' has been\nlimiting our thoughts! There are all sorts of bureaucrats,\ne.g. Positive bureaucrats (PBs) and negative ones (NBs).\nNBs are those whose activities deliberately prevent things\nhappening or cover up for incompetence or suppress knowledge and information, e.g. passport officials, censors, 'front\nclerks' who have a string of ready answers\u2014'Being looked\ninto', 'under consideration', against the regulations', not feasible, etc. etc....\nPBs are those Bs who make use of bureaucratic systems in\na creative and constructive way and are fundamentally different in outlook from NBs. As examples of PBs we have\ngroups of activists, ad-hoc committees, organisers (usually).\nClubs in IC are obviously operated by, essentially, PBs\u2014they\nare trying to make things happen, have meetings, etc. PBs of\ncourse are liable to resort to the methods of NBs to hide their\nmistakes, appear in 'full control' and stop things happening.\nQuite often PBs think a bit more like UBs than NBs.\nAre you a PB, UB or NB? Does IC teach people to be\nany one type?\nDOUBLE PUNISHMENT Following Brian Hains' article on College Discipline, Spike Bantin writes on how he feels justice\nshould be administered by State and University.\nI would like to point out that Brian Hains' article in\nFELIX last term arose out of discussion held by Council,\nafter receiving several documents from JURGO concerning\ndiscipline in Universities. On considering them, it was found\nthat the only points over which there was likely to be disagreement were double punishment, the internal College\ndisciplinary procedure and the ill-defined crime of bringing\nthe name of the College into disrepute.\nI should like to take this opportunity to elaborate on these\npoints as they could be vitally important to any one of us\nat sometime in the future.\nDouble punishment is defined in this case as the exercising of justice through two bodies for the same offence, and\nas such often occurs throughout society. However, this does\nnot infer that this is either necessary or satisfactory. To\nanalyse further, we might refer to the texts on English law,\nfrom which one may conclude that the State is bound to\nintervene when a crime is committed relating to the upholding of public order. In this case, therefore, any action taken\nby the College would amount to double punishment. Any\nsuch crime is considered by the state because, as well as any\ninjured party, it finds it abhorrent, the trial resulting in\ncriminal rather than civil justice. If convicted, the purpose\nof punishment is fourfold and relates to demonstrating to\nthe community that law is being maintained.\nPunishment\nTo the individual the effect of punishment itself cannot\nbe estimated but is thought by many to be detrimental;\none presumes the only worthwhile feature is the attempt at\nreformation during the sentence..\nHaving served the sentence, the criminal imagines that\nhe has atoned for his crime but it is an unfortunate fact\nthat society as a whole cannot yet accept this. This does not\ninfer that we, as a College, should either emulate this or\ncondone it. It is my opinion that no further action should\nbe taken since it can only result in further suffering, probably much greater than that caused by the original sentence.\nThe classic argument against this may be generalised by\nproposing that a crime may be more significant to one\nbranch of society than another. It is obvious, but not often\nconsidered, that criminal mis demean ours are always more\noffensive to that part of society in which they occur, and\nthis is exactly the reason that the legal system was instituted.\nIf this were not so then the punishment of any crime would\nrelate to the power of the injured party rather than the\nsignificance of the crime. Moreover, statistics have shown\nthat only some twenty per cent of first offenders were ever\nre convicted. It may be argued further that this twenty per\ncent are generated by the hostile attitude of society when\nfinding employment for these people after their first imprison-ment. Thus in re punishing an individual a second time we\nare ignoring statistics and succumbing to the old attitudes\nand prejudices. I would contend that if a student is tried for\na crime by the State it should be impertinent and inhumane\nfor the College to subject him to further punishment.\nHowever, in the case where an offence is a crime against\nthe College or Union By-Laws the College has a right and\nduty to uphold these By-Laws for the benefit of all. Since\nthe By-Laws already exist, it remains only to have a system\navailable to deal fairly with any offences. At the moment\nthere is no real system, hence Council attempted to rational-ise those proceedings that do exist to form a general procedure applicable to all crimes. They decided to put responsibility for petty offences, that is those requiring a punishment not interfering in any significant way with a student's studies, in the hands of the organisation concerned. However, in the case where this body felt a serious punishment\nwas required, it would be left to them to ask for trial by a well-defined (but flexible in composition) and independent\ndisciplinary committee of staff and students. By this means\nto obtain a fair trial in the first instance without personal\nembarrassment or bias; the body requesting the hearing\nwould act as prosecution providing such information and\nwitnesses that are required. This would be coupled to a higher appeal system.\nThe importance of holding disciplinary proceedings in the\nopen cannot be over stressed since it acts as a deterrent, as\nprotection for the individual and against rumour. This is\nthe failing of the present system since investigations are held\nin camera and verdicts are prop o gated by hearsay.\nHall Discipline\nHall discipline procedures are better defined, but I have\nfound them through my own personal experience to be\nunconvincing in operation. Therefore for continuity and improvement I would propose that the general disciplinary\ncommittee be used for serious Hall matters as well. With a system such as this in existence there could be no doubt that\njustice was being done. Moreover, such a committee would\nbe able to record its verdicts and therefore future crimes\ncould be assessed with a good idea of past actions. The\nsetting up of this committee would be a great step forward\nand must be instigated forthwith.\nFinally to the third point, the more nebulous concept of\nbringing the name of the College into disrepute. To me\nthis seems impossible to define, but, one presumes, arises from\nactions by some individual or group resulting in bad publicity for the College. Surely the only reasonable action\nwould be to make certain that any punishment meted out\nin respect of the action that caused adverse publicity is also\nmade known.\nTo sum up, the application of Justice to society has been\na problem facing those concerned since the dawn of civilisation and has resulted in a well-proven system in this country.\nIt would therefore appear sensible for us to treat this system\nwith respect, where necessary to emulate it and not set ourselves up as a detached autonomy.\n\n"

    "content": "IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION No. 278 22nd MAY, 1969 6dM.P. s Quiz College\nBy our Special Correspondent, Piers Corbyn\nThe visit of the parliamentary committee on student relations was poorly\npublicised and poorly attended \u2014 quite a few students\nknew Wednesday was the\nday but had no correct\nknowledge of the timetable.\nAt 10 a.m. six students\nwere publicly questioned by\nsix M.P's. in Mech. Eng.\n220. Audience participation\nwas not allowed (old fashioned bureaucrats used the\nexcuse of parliamentary pri-vile ges). Discussions centred\nround a two page report\npresented by the six students.\nThe sole left representative,\nDave Christopher, presented\na document of about the\nsame length with an appendix of about five times the\nlength (available from the\nPolcoun library), using much\nmaterial from FELIX.\n4\nParticipation'\nQuestions covered many\nsubjects so in the 1\u00a3 hours\ndiscussion in depth was im-possible. The M.P's. were\nsurprised I.C. was not in the\nNUS. The USK was welcomed as the beginning (or\nso it would have appeared\nto the M.P's.) of I.C's. probing into the great big out-side. Rakesh Mohan outlined the overwhelming demand for ' non technical\nstudies' (not necessarily\nmanagement studies). Dissatisfaction was expressed at\nthe ' participation' offered\nat I.C. Although we have\nrepresentation it seems that\nthe student voice is only\nneeded if the authorities\nagree; the student 'participation' role in I.C. is at present not much more than one\nof suggesting ideas for the\nauthorities to implement or\nnot \u2014 the direction of events\nbeing beyond student influence, students representation\non the Board of studies,\nFinance and Executive Committee and Governing Body\ncould help. Student unrest\nwas probed(!) \u2014 various\nreply s resulting. Dave Christopher gave (to applause) a long 'speech' on ' alienation ' (from the whole of\nsociety) of which student\nunrest is only a facet.\nThe Staff interviewed after\nthe students, presented a confused picture \u2014 probably\nin more disarray than the\nstudents! Sinclair Goodland\nstated that they had been\n' selected by mysterious processes '. Their main discussion began on the purpose\nof I.C's. education. Some of\nthe M.P's. feeling that Article 2 of the Charter of\nIncorporation (centre of ex-cell en ce) was a bit narrow.\nIn the ensuing discussion\nProf. Ford (Mech. Eng. head\nof dept.) proudly claimed\nthat non-tech nj cal studies\nhad been going on in his\ndepartment for 20 years.\nProf. Coles and others pointed out that studying Economics and Management Studies (presumably in order to\nmake industry more efficient)\nwas a little different from\njoining into ' the total intellectual activity of man'. A Prof, from the Maths. Department claimed (to audience derision) that in the\nMaths, department super-specialization was necessary\nto maintain I.C's. status as\na place which annually produced 15 brilliant mathematicians. Prof. Ford, despite\nhis proud claim of ' broad\ncourses ', said that this country needed ' centres of\nexcellence'.\nThe M.P's. suggested that\nonce I.C. had been three\ninstitutions \u2014 why not make\nit into a broader college of\n5 or 6 or 7 \u2014 incorporate it\nwith the nearby colleges?\nThe perennial question of\nfailure rates arose and flitted\naway before the glare of suspicious faces.\nThe ' Authorities' were\nnot as coherent on the problems of I.C. as the M.P's. were in questioning them.\nThey confirmed that the\nFinance and Executive committee was the power house\nand gave a nice picture of\nJURGO. Student houses and\nstaff - student committees\nwere presented as examples\nof where co-operation has\nworked well.\nStudent Unrest\nLord Penney, on student\nunrest, felt that it was contagious and something to do\nwith society at large \u2014 not\njust universities. He ended\nhis comment on it amidst\nloud cheers ' these are all\nproblems I don't really\nunderstand'. The Rector\nsaid he disagreed with the\nstudent view that their representatives should be ' mand-a table' and believed like\nother members of ' the\nauthorities' that the college\nshould avoid these ' pyramid\nlike methods of industry'\n(presumably because they\nsharpen frustration).\nThe discussion afterwards\n(not recorded by the M.P's. who mostly went back to\nParliament) uncovered g los sed-over grievances and\nideas \u2014 lucidly expounded\nby Harry Fairbrother, many\nof the students, Dr. Steven\nRose and others. People\nwho spoke on the subject\nmostly stated (with exam-ple s) that feedback only\nworked well when it was in\nthe interests of the authorities that it should.\nThe real purpose of the\ncommittee is, it seems, to\nfind ways of curbing student\nunrest. Student unrest is only\na facet of the unrest of\nsociety\u2014if not the world . . .\nWhat recommendation will\nthe Committee make?\nPrince Philip\nscores a hit\nThe RCSU social event of\nthe decade passed smoothly\non Wednesday evening, May\n14th, to the general acclaim\nof the Union, Press and\nBBC. Prince Philip came to\ndinner, made a witty speech,\nlingered in South-side Bar\nand slipped off home just\nbefore eleven o 'clock.\nOn his arrival the Duke of\nEdinburgh was welcomed by\na reception party of about\n20 Union officials and their\nladies. Balding, but impressive in stature he joked with\nthe lads before being led to\nhis place as guest of honour\nby RCS President Gwyn\nHughes. Ranged along the\ntop table were an impressive\ngroup of department heads,\nLords Penney and Sherfield\nand their wives. The spaces\nwere filled by Union officials, including Pam Horrocks deep in conversation\nwith the Rector on the intricacies of cricket.\nConsidering the mass of\nguests, over 350, Mooney\nsurprised all by the excellence of his cooking, although the wine was criticised. The main course was\nesc a lope of Veal Concalaise\naccompanied by Chateau\nBrane Cantenac 1962. It was\nduring this that Piers\n(CEFE) Corbyn enlivened\nproceedings by presenting\nthe Prince with a balloon.\nThere was also a number of\nmore vital happenings as a surprising number of guests\nleft their seats to the usual\naccompaniment only to slink\nback later. These events were\nlater commented on by the\nPresidents of Mines and\nGuilds.\nPrince Philip opened wittily his speech to toast\nRCSU, and thanked RCS\nfor his welcome, which, he\nsaid, had surprised him seeing how many of the officers\nwere Welsh. To loud cheers\nhe refused to comment on\nUniversities as he was one\nof those ' ignorant bums who\nnever went to one'. After a brief discourse on our crazy\nworld and its problems he\nended with two words for\nRCS members on their\nUnion: ' use it'.\nIn his reply Gwyn Hughes\nshowed a slight touch of\nnerves as he fumbled with\nhis notes but after this shaky\nstart he produced a surprisingly good speech which\nquoted extensively from\nFELIX. Chris Yewlett,\nRCSU Secretary, proposed\nthe toast to the guests in a befitting manner, mercifully\nfree of his usual puns. The\nresponse to this toast was\nmade by Lord Sherfield, the\nChairman of the Governors\nwho also entered into the\nspirit of the occasion, putting\nhis glasses on and taking\nthem off to emphasise his\npoints. There was some\nlaughter when it seemed\nthat Lord Sherfield was suggesting he didn't have\nenough girls but it now\nappears he was suggesting\nRCS was short of girls, and\na small walkout over a short\npassage interpreted as critical of ASTMS.\nAfter the dinner H.R.H. met\nguests in the South-side bar,\nlingering over Stan's beer\nuntil just before eleven when\nRCS's distinguished guest\nslipped off home still joking\nmerrily.\nChain Reaction\nTo force a speedy settlement of the technicians' dis-put e, the ASTMS at universities throughout the country have withdrawn the\nlabour of key technical staff.\nThere is widespread sympathy for the wage-claim\nfrom university administrations, and many of these,\nincluding I.C., are now urging the Department of Education and Science to settle\nthe dispute nationally. At\nI.C. the Administration\nagreed that the 28 key tech-nci an s, largely store-men, out\non strike should not be vic-timi sed, nor should anyone\nelse do their work.\nIn opposition to the line\nadopted by the Administration, the Biochemistry Stores\nwas opened at 11.30 a.m. on\nMonday, 12th May. Within\nfifteen minutes over a hundred technicians gathered\noutside the office of the\n{Establishment Officer, and\na delegation was elected to\nsee him. The Stores was\nclosed on Tuesday and Wednesday.\nHowever, the Biochemistry Stores was re-opened on\nThursday morning, and all\nsections of the department\nwere encouraged to use it.\nThe situation was discussed\nat a general meeting of the\nI.C. branch of ASTMS that\nlunchtime. The meeting\ndecided that each time\naction was taken t \u00a9 break\nthe effectiveness of the key-worker strike, the whole\nmembership of the I.C. Branch would stop work for\ntwo hours. The meeting also\ndecided that the first stoppage had already been provoked by the Biochemistry\nDepartment, and thus a demonstration was held outside that department from\ntwo o 'clock until four. Representatives were sent to\nevery Head of Department\nto explain the reason for\ntheir lack of technical staff,\nand Professor Chain's superfluity of same.\nFrom all over the college\nthere have been reports of\nspontaneous reaction to\nattempts to bypass the stores\nwhich have been closed.\nMany immediate walk-outs\nhave been threatened, and\nmaterials coming directly\ncontinued on back page\n\n"

I hope that this includes the Rector.\nYou comment on the proposed visit by a Parliamentary Select Committee and say that\nthe Rector was asked to provide a wide spread of opinion from staff, students and author-i ties. You use inflammatory language and assert that the President of the Union and the\nRector have fallen into the error of trying to preserve the good name of Imperial\nCollege. You state that I submitted an uninspired list of respectable staff but gave no hint\nof an \"unorthodox protestor, staff or student\"\nA journalist who gets his facts wrong soon gets the sack. Let me say what the facts are.\nThe College was told by the Secretary of the Select Committee they would like to have\nthree sessions, one to meet students, one to meet staff and one to meet the authorities. They\nwould like a representative cross-section, about half a dozen in each session.\nI asked the Secretary of the College to organise an election of four members of staff. This\nwas done\u2014first the collection of nominations from staff on a personal notice to all members\nof the permanent staff and then by written ballot, where there was a high poll. I also\ninvited the Imperial College branch of the Association of University Teachers to nominate two staff members. This they did. With regard to the student group, I told the\nPresident of the Union what the Committee wanted and asked him to consult student\nopinion in any way he thought best. In due course, some names were sent to me and\nincluded as the College student team.\nWith regard to the Authorities, I discussed the matter at the Deans' Committee and we\nmade the choice, including a postgraduate student warden and the Chairman of the Governing Body as members of our team.\nYours truly,\nWilliam $ en ntp INEPTITUDE\nDear Sir,\nIn the last few days the\nshortcomings of Imperial College Union and its leadership\nhave been well demonstrated\non two occasions. On Tuesday, a small group of dedicated reactionaries destroyed\nthe work of many and\nthe interest of more by\nkilling the Constitutional Reform motion at the Union\nmeeting. If Messrs. Andrews,\nMackman, and co. really\nbelieve that the motion\nshould not be discussed at an\nin quo rate meeting, why didn't they make efforts to get\npeople to the meeting by\npublic ising it, as their opponents did? One can only\nconclude that they are afraid\nof having to discuss the\nproposals and must resort to\nthe lowest and most negative\nmeans at their disposal.\nOn Wednesday, those concerned enough to attend the\nmeeting of the Parliamentary\nSub-Committee were frustrated at having to watch in\nsilence as our \"represent-at ives\" struggled to express\nthemselves. The ineptitude\nwas amply demonstrated\nwhen Rex Lowin, doing most\nof the talking, found himself\nin many cases having to\ndefend a position he did not\nsupport, which surely exactly\ndemonstrated the need for\nbetter representation before\nthat committee.\nThe Sub-committee conclusions must have been\nbased on (a) the incoherence\nand lack of courtesy of the\nstudents in not preparing\nthemselves properly (e.g. the\nhopeless muddle Rex Lowin\ngot into when questioned on\nUnion discipline) and (b)a general feeling of satisfaction\nwith and disinterest in\nstudent-staff relations at this\ncollege, due to a general incoherence on the part of the\nstudents, over-general ising by\nstaff, and whitewashing by\nProf. Ford and the admin-is t ration. One can only hope that\nnext year will bring a more\ninterested student body and a more efficient and, above all,\nmore representative Union\nhierarchy.\nYours,\nBruce Henderson,\nMech.

The boat had not\nalready been ordered, and\nCouncil voted in favour of\nthe project in the knowledge\nthat it could as easily be\nvetoed. The report does\nnot state that the loan\nwill be repaid from the\nusual hiring out charges, nor\ndoes it mention the College\ngrant of \u00a3500.

Dear Sir,\nSome of your readers may\nrecall during last session\nsome mentions in FELIX of\na scheme proposed by Tizard\nHall Committee to make\navailable camp beds, so that\nHall residents could put up\nguests in their rooms in reasonable comfort (and leg-ali ty) at a modest cost. A letter detailing the arguments in favour of this\nscheme was sent round to all\nHall Committees, after which the proposal was approved by the Halls of Residence Representatives Committee (consisting of students\nreps, from each Hall com-mitte e) with the proviso that\nit should be tried as an\nexperiment by one Hall first\n(the Warden and Housekeeper of Tizard were willing\nto co-operate in this). It then\nWASTE\nDear Sir,\nSince the last Union meeting was rather prematurely\nadjourned, I would like to\nsuggest a motion to the\ngeneral mass of the student\nbody through your columns,\nwhich I otherwise would\nhave proposed at the meet-ing.\nCouncil has chosen to ignore the minority report on\nthe President's Dinner and\nDance and a Union meeting\ncould not discuss it. In my\nview, this report did not go\nfar enough either. The central issue is the colossal waste\nof \u00a3400 spent on this extraneous occasion; the facts that\npeople want to wear dinner\njackets or other Zombie kits\nis entirely irrelevant. Usually\nthis \u00a3400 comes out of the\nEnts profits throughout the\nyear. Why should this money\nnot go to the Carnival char-it y? Particularly this year\nwhile we profess concern\nover the plight of unmarried\nmothers,, our President writes\nto 'The Times' complaining\nabout people's uncharitable\nattitude towards this unfortunate set of our society, all\nwe do is to raise about \u00a31000\nby walking 27 miles on a cold damp night and then\nvirtually pass the money over\nto affluent pop-groups. Not\nonly is this situation scandalous it is immoral in the\nextreme.\nThe least we can do now\nis to hand over the \u00a3400 to\nbe spent on the President's D&D to the NCUMC.\nThe Union bureaucrats\ncan have their little (or big)\n'do' if they want to but they\nmust pay for it. I don't care\nif the top table get cigars\nand champagne\u2014or hashish\nfor that matter if they want\nit\u2014but I do object to Union\nmoney being spent in this\nway.\nI appeal to everyone to\nwrite in to the President of\nthe Union and demand that\nthis \u00a3400 be given to the\nNCUMC.\nYours faithfully,\nRakesh Mohan.\nwent to the Student Residence\nCommittee (Rector, Senior\nWarden, all Hall wardens\nand only three students)\nwhich by all accounts was\nless than receptive to the\nplan. However a sub-commit-tee was set up under the\nchairmanship of Mr. Stephenson, the Senior Warden,\nwhich, judging from its\nreport, seems to have had\nmore interest in preserving\nthe status quo than taking\nthe suggestion seriously. Copies of the original letter to\nHall Committees were made\navailable, despite which the\nprincipal reason advanced\nfor the rejection of the idea\nhad already been at least\npartially refuted in it.\nIn retrospect, the reasons\nwhy this particular proposal\nlooks at present to be lost\ncan be traced directly to inadequate student representation on the Student Residence Committee. By going\nthrough the accepted channels the fate of it has been\nleft to two Halls reps., one of\nwhom was lukewarm to the\nidea and one opposed to it.\nIt seems to us that this\ncase presents a strong argument for greatly increased\nstudent representation from\nthe residents on the Student\nResidence Committee (if\nthere is one warden per Hall\non it, why not one student\nper Hall as well?).\nFinally, since the rules\nonly disallow unauthorised\nguests there is no reason why\nTizard or any other Hall\nshould not run the scheme\non its own, the Warden au-tho rising those who made use\nof the beds. Originally it was\ndecided that the proposal\nrepresented such a great departure from accepted practice it should be put to the\nStudent Residence Committee first. After the superficial\nway in which this body has\ndealt with it we are not so\nsure.\nJ.D. Cooper, Chairman,\nTizard Hall Committee\n1967-68; D.

Moont, Mr. R. Bantin.\nELECTRICITY WAS\nSir,\nNEVER FREE\nIn reply to Mr. Giles' letter of 8th May, the Bernard\nSunley House Committee would like to make the following\npoints:\n1) We agree that nobody likes to be presented with an\nelectricity bill, but electricity has never been free. Many\namounts removed from meters in single rooms were over \u00a36\nfor the term, so \u00a38 does not seem in excess for an un-metered electric fire. All complaints about the electricity\nbills were heard, and six bills were either withdrawn or\nreduced.\nResidents have not been told that the house is running\ninto financial difficulties. No permanent \"enlargements\" were\nthought of, never mind suggested, and there is no overcrowding in the house.\n2) The House Committee, which includes the Warden and\nSub-Wardens, has always been prepared to answer questions\nabout the running of the house, yet Mr. Giles approached\nnone of us to check any of his so-called facts.\nAs a house Committee we expect criticism and welcome\nit provided that it is accurate and constructive. That of Mr.\nGiles was neither\u2014he did not check any of his facts, merely\nreported hearsay.\n3) Finally we would like to point out that Student Houses\nare a new venture and some difficulties to to be expected, but\nthese can be overcome with the co-operation of all con-cern ed. Yours sincerely,\nK. Ellis,\nSecretary, Bernard Sunley House Committee.\n^ \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 ^ \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 ^\nNEXT FELIX\nThis will be the last\nfull Felix of the year.\nThe next spectacular\nissue will appear on\nFreshers' Day, under the\neditorship of Malcolm\nWilliamson. Due to financial difficulties, mainly\ncaused by a scarcity of\nadvertising and losses\nfrom the Felix stands,\nthe last two issues have\nbeen only eight pages\ninstead of the usual ten.\nWe hope that next year\nwe will be able to produce regular ten-page\nissues throughout the\nyear, but this largely\ndepends on our not losing too much by students\nand others not paying\nfor their Felix.\nOur readers are reminded that Felix now\ncosts sixpence and not\nfour pence, as some of\nour stands still advertise.

Obviously the\ndemands of lunch and examinations exerted a greater\npull on the enthusiasm of\nmost guilds men. The proceedings were characterised\nby the usual Guild's sound\neffects, amidst a hail of chalk\nand hooting car horns. After\nthe minutes had been read\nthere was a slight interruption when Dermott Corr\nannounced the presence of\na member of R.C.S. The culprit was asked to sing a verse of ' All things bright\nand beautiful' or else. A members of I. C.W. A. was\nthen seen to slip quietly out\nof the front door to cries of\n' knickers'.\nNon-political\nThe remainder of the time\nwas spent with the proposal\nspeeches. Of the candidates\nfor president Stephen Bates\nrose first to be proposed by\nDave Foster followed by\nBob Pine proposing Stuart\nSimpson. Neither of the\nspeeches were particularly\ninspiring although both pro-posers gave an impressive list\nof their candidates achieve-ment s. When left to answer questions the candidates both\nexpressed their desire to see\nGuild's Union as a social\nand sporting body, not as a political one. Stuart Simpson described himself as\nbeing politically centre while\nStephen Bates regarded himself as being more right of\ncentre with a wish to steer\nclear of political 'hang-ups'.\nThe remainder of the posts\nwere unopposed except for\nthe Vice-Presidency and the\nRepresentative on Council.\nDave Matthew gave an\namusing speech for Dennis\nTaylor presenting a pseudo-po u ff image while Frank\nColdwell proposing Steve\nButtling seemed bored with\nthe whole affair. Chris Lewis,\nthe only candidate in fancy\ndress his countenance obscured by dark glasses and\ntop hat, did not seem to\nthink much about anything\nwhile Roger Phillips, the\nsecond candidate for Rep.\non Council, estimated the\ntotal Council grant at only\nabout four thousand pounds.\nFemininity won through as\nMandy Jones proposed as\nO.C. representative refused\nto comment whether she felt\nthere was anything big in\nfront of her for the future.\nBefore the meeting closed\na motion was proposed that\nall members of Guild's should boycott the service of\nthe Queen's Arms. Since noone rose to oppose the\nmotion it was duly carried\nand Dermott Corr is sending\na letter officially acknowledging the decision. The\nproceedings were then closed\nwith the traditional Boomalaka at a quarter past two.\nIncrease in Mooney\nPrices Next Session\nIan Jarvis proposes\nChris Lewis at\nGuilds' Hustings.\nR. C.S.U. Fades Away\nRCS Union faded away\nuntil next year with an anti-climatic Union meeting\nlast Thursday, May 15th, the\nday after Prince Philip's visit. With the major elections for President, VicePresident and Secretary last\nterm only the lesser posts on\ngeneral committee remained\nto be filled. Steve Cann,\nPhys. I, was elected Assistant Secretary unopposed\nand the only major contests\nwere for Ents. committee\nand Academic Affairs Officer. Graham McNeilly of\nMaths was proposed by his\ndepartment rep. and, after\nsome confusion John\nMcAdam, Phys. II, by Les.\nEbdon. McNeilly's proposer\nwas largely inaudible but\nEbdon's speech, although\nextempore, secured a large\nN.U.S. AT I.C.A London Regional N.U.S. Conference will be\nheld at I.C. on May 31st. These conferences are held\ntwice a year, and representatives from most London\nColleges attend. Although\nI.C. is not a member of\nN.U.S., it sends delegates to\nthese meetings and I.C. students who wish to attend\nare welcome. Further details\nwill be posted on the notice\nboard.\nmajority for McAdam, this\nyear's chairman of Comm.\nSoc. Les stressed McAdam's activity in academic affairs\nand interest in Council,\nwhere the officer is RCSU\nrep. Various reports were\nread from Union officers\nand Pete Dolwin proposed a motion giving RCS Broadsheet a grant next year.\nThanks\nPrior to the usual initiation ceremonies of the new\nPresident and his Vice, at\nwhich the eggs thrown at\nofficials were auctioned for\nChristian Aid, Les Ebdon\nproposed a vote to the President and the President proposed a vote of thanks to\nhis General Committee.\nNEW MINIBUS\nAnother Ford Transit\nminibus has been purchased\nto replace the vehicle which\nwas written off last term. It\nis available for hire, and\nbooking forms may be obtained from the Union office.\nThe charges are the same\nas those for the last vehicle\nalthough there are more restrictions on drivers' experience. Reforms Wrecked\nE.G. M. to come ?\nTwo meetings of Imperial\nCollege Union were held on\nTuesday, May 15th. The\nfirst, the adjourned meeting\nfrom last term, was quickly\nclosed and the second ended\nafter some twenty minutes in\npandemonium after a quorum challenge. It is still\nnot known whether this\nmeans that the popular constitutional reforms voted for\nby an overwhelming majority at the last meeting will\nall be lost. The meeting did,\nhowever, elect Phil Poyser\nonto Council as a floor rep.\nDave Wield proposed Poyser, a Chem. P.G., pointing\nto his considerable service\nto the I.C. athletic, foreign\nvisits and political scene and\noutlined his policies \u2014 more\nUnion control of finance and\nP.G. involvement. Dermott\nCorr proposed Richard Olley, Metallurgy 3, saying\nhe was opposed to mud-slinging, especially in Union\npublications. On a paper\nballot Poyser romped home\nby 144 votes to 89 with a number of abstentions.\nBefore discussion started\non the constitutional reforms\nJohn Andrews, Hon. Pornographer of Mines, attempted\nto move such discussion to\nthe end of the meeting, this\nwas heavily defeated, amid\njeering. Andrews then challenged the quorum and despite loud protests the Union\nwas counted out, being about\n30 short of the required 300.\nAttempts are now being\nmade to call an E.G. M. for\nthis week (see Felicity) and\nPiers Corbyn and others had\ncollected, by Friday, over the\nnecessary 130 signatures for\na motion declaring in quo rate meetings as non-meetings.\nApparently this is legally\nacceptable. Informed circles\nview the loss of the reforms\nas a major defeat for the\ncentre and feel they are\nbound to strengthen the call\nby the left for more far-reaching reforms.\nAt a recent Catering subcommittee meeting the\naccounts for the first nine\nmonths of this session were\npresented showing a deficit\nof over \u00a3500 and an estimated deficit of between \u00a32000\nand \u00a33000 at the end of the\nsession. This loss has been\nmainly attributed to a decrease in takings at the\nEaster conferences.\nMore Wages\nAlso, next session College\nBlock will open involving\nmore capt i al costs and more\nwages. However, part of the\ncosts will be offset by the\nHolland Club members who\nwill be using the Refectory\nfacilities next session.\n3d. on meals\nAs a result of this, the\nsub-committee recommended\nto the Refectory committee\nthe following price increases:\n7% on cafeteria service (3d. per meal), 15% on waitress\nservice (6d. per meal). Internal functions, e.g. Hall dinner and Freshers' dinners\nwill increase by 10% and external functions by 20%.\nThe Refectory Committee\nagreed to these increases and\nthat they should come into\nbeing on August 1st. Notting Hill\nAppeal\nMost people have, at some\ntime or other, heard of the\nneeds of those who live in\nthe districts of Notting Hill\nand North Kensington. Despite all complaints it remains a fact that perhaps\nthe greatest harm and disappointment is brought to\nthe many thousands of children who live in these dis-tr ict s. One of the greatest\nneeds is for a safe and constructive place to play. Most\nof the Children do not have\nthe sophisticated toys which\nmost middle-class children\nexpect. The large majority\nare left to play in the streets\nat the mercy of the London\ntraffic.\nTo counteract this need\nvarious bodies are asking\nfor volunteers to help produce play grounds and to\nconduct play groups for\nchildren. The money is there\nso all is needed is the manpower and women-power to\nachieve the result.\nIt is not purely charity as\nit is hoped that the volunteers will also gain from the\nexperience.\nFor six weeks from July\n29th to 17th August Notting Hill Social Council will\nbe asking for 120 volunteers.\nVolunteers will be housed\nlocally, if necessary. It may\nbe necessary to bring sleeping bags or air mattresses.\nThe cost will be a contribution towards food\u2014in total\nabout four and a half\npounds.\nFor a two week period\nfrom the 16th August through to the 29th August,\nthe Student Christian Movement will be conducting a similar programme at a cost\nof thirty shillings. Sheets and\nblankets may be needed if\nstudents wish to live in. Travelling expenses may be paid\nfor those travelling to and\nfrom Notting Hill while on\nthe job.\nIf you wish to volunteer\ncontact Mick Braybrook,\nOld Beit.\n\u2022A.S.T.M. S. dispute\n(con td.) from the Main Stores have\nbeen declared black.\nShort\nSympathetic\nDiscussions commenced on\nThursday, 15th May between\nthe Minister of Education\nand the ASTMS. Edward\nShort was reported to be\nsympathetic towards the\ntechnicians claim, and further meetings are expected\nto take place on Monday\n17th or Tuesday 18th, so\nlook at Felicity for more\nrecent news.\nDiscipline\nImpasse\nAs reported exclusively in\nlast week's FELIX the negotiations over disciplinary\nprocedures are deadlocked\non the question of double\npunishment. According to informed FELIX sources the\nworking-party on the negotiations are to report back\nto JURGO this week, see\nFELICITY for latest developments. Rex Lowin presiding over I.C.U. "

TRIUMPH ON SPORTS DAY\nYet another Cup fell to\nthe RCS sportsmen last\nSaturday when they won\nthe Governors' Challenge\nShield for the Constituent\nCollege Athletics match.\nNo Stars\nThe occasion was detracted from somewhat by\nthe fact that the Fete was\non the same day and that\nthe star athletes were competing for UL U in Paris.\nNevertheless, considerable\neffort was put into the\nafternoon by those 'athletes'\nthat did turn up and the\nhardy band of officials who\nseem to be there every\nyear.\nThere were few performances of outstanding\nmerit, but the dual for overall superiority developed\ninto a nail-biting affair between RCS and C&G. Eventually all hung on\nthe final event, the 4 x400 metres relay. It was close\nfought all the way, with RCS\neventually winning in 3 min.\n49.7 sees, with C&G second\nin 3 mins. 49.4 sees. \u2014 a truly dramatic finish.\nDeserving of a mention\nare Pine (C&G) and Stephenson (RCS) who tied for\nthe best individual total of\nthe afternoon with 26 points\neach, Also Critchley of\nC&G who, throwing the\njavelin for the first time in\n2 years, beat the rest of the\nfield by over 30 ft. throwing about 170 ft.\nLilas Champion\nRCS had the consolation\nof winning the girls' competition thanks mainly to\nLilas Campion who had the\ndistinction of winning all\nthe girl's events. They also\nwon the Tug-of-War out-right.\nLady Penney presented\nthe cups to the somewhat\nsparse applause of the few\nspectators and athletes.\nIt is a shame that there\nisn't more athletic and\nspectator interest in the\nCollege at present for\nSports Day since it is\npotentially one of the most\nenjoyable events of the year.\nTony Mason is to be congratulated on what he did\nmanage to achieve as organiser under very trying\ncircumstances.\nGolf Club Returns To\nOld Home\nCOURAGE NOT ENOUGH\nOn May 4th at 9.23 a.m.6 people from Physics I attempted to swim the\nChannel. The team arrived\nin Folkestone on Friday\nevening and found that the\nweather for cast prohibited\nswimming on Saturday.\nHowever, as is typical with\nEnglish weather (and it\nseems any event connected\nwith this year's charity) the\ndepression moved and it\nwould have been a perfect\nday to make the attempt.\nThe pilot took the team for\nhalf and hour's swim and\nthe rest of the day was\nspent relaxing,\nAt 5 a.m. on Sunday, the\neight strong contingent, together with two Channel\nSwimming Association ob-servers, boarded the boat.\nSeasickness claimed the organiser of the swim and the\nonly crew member as victims shortly afterwards. The\nboat anchored at Cap GrisNez and the first swimmer\nentered the water. The weather worsened, three to four\nfoot waves being whipped\nup by the wind and after\nfour or five miles had been\ncovered one of the swimmers\ncollapsed in the water and\nthe swim had to be\nabandoned.\nThe Vice Chairman of\nthe Channel Swimming Association said in a letter to\nthe Physics I rep: \"It was\na grand scheme alright\n\u2014 there is a world of\ndifference between the\ncomparative safety of your\nLondon river and the deep,\ndark and dangerous English\nChannel, where a man in\nthe water is so alone and\nall on the escort boat in\nthe snug comfort of their\ntrack suits and sleeping\nbags are his bitter enemies.\nMagnificent\n\"To swim, without protective clothing, in a temperature of 48 \u00b0F for one\nhour is a feat in itself, but\nif one can do this after 4\u20145\nhours in a rolling boat, then\nhe can hold his head high\nin any company of endurance swimmers\". He\ncommended Pete Marwood,\nthe team's captain, who\n\"with a magnificent cap-tain's effort set a splendid\nexample to the rest of his\nteam\". Credit is due to the\nother swimmers: John Bethell, Jeremy Bowler,\nRichard Fisher, Pete Lonnen and Victor Steiner and\nto the people who spent\ntime writing to firms about\nsponsorship: Crista Gausden, Subia Chatterjee,\nRichard Gleave and Ed\nRobins..\nACTION IN NOTTING HILL\nFollowing the publication\nof the interim report of the\nNotting Hill Housing Service on housing conditions,\na public meeting was held\nat Lancaster Road Methodist Church on Monday \u2014\n5th May. The survey from\nwhich the report was taken\nwas part of the 1967 Notting Hill Summer Project.\nOvercrowding\nOvercrowding is severe.\n69% of the people (and\n85% of children) live at a density of greater than 1\nperson per room. This represents more than 1800\nfamilies. 28% of the population are s tatu tori ly over-crowded, compared with a figure of 6.3% for the whole\nof the Royal Borough of\nKensington and Chelsea and\na national average of 1.6%.\nThe rents paid s are commonly around \u00a34, though\nrents up to \u00a39 are not un-common. Tenants fall into\nthree categories: Those paying controlled rents because\nthey have been in residence\nfor 20 years or more and\nwho pay relatively low rents\nfor reasonable ac com moda tion. However they are still\nworse off than the national\naverage; secondly there are\nthe tenants in unfurnished\nflats, who are protested by\nthe 1965 Rent Act and are\nless well off than the controlled tenants; lastly there\nare the furnished tenants\nwho have little protection by\nthe law and even less from\nthe Kensington and Chelsea\nCouncil. These are the residents new to the area who\ndo not know the rules and\ndo not know how to fight.\nBecause families are prepared to pay rents of \u00a33 or\nmore for any sort of roof\nover their heads, to prevent\nthe break up of the family,\nlandlords find it profitable\nto subdivide tenancies.\nWhere this happens, tenancies are small, overcrowding\nand the price per room is\ngreatest and value for money\nis least.\nGeorge Clark, director of\nthe Notting Hill Housing\nService said that the Council was clearly to blame for\nthe situation and that the\ntime had come for the community to take action. This\nrequired a co-ordinated\neffort on behalf of all the\ngroups in the area and not\nthe selfish separate of individuals or factions.\nChallenge\nHe issued a challenge to\nthe Kensington and Chelsea\nCouncil to start drastic action to rescue families in\ndistress immediately. If this\nwere not done by January\n1st.1970, there would be\n\"a campaign of civil disobedience such as the country had not seen.\"\nThis statement was\nheckled by militants who\nthought that such a campaign should start immediately. Chris Holmes of the Notting Hill Community Workshop made the point that\nthe Council had always\nbeen delighted to shelve its\nresponsibilities onto voluntary bodies such as the Notting Hill Housing Trust. He\ncriticised the idea brought\nforward earlier of using\nrent controls and tribunals\nwhich would encourage\nlandlords to decrease the\nstock of 'cheap' rented accommodation by converting\nit to luxury accommodation,\nbeyond the financial capabilities of the present oc-cup ants. Compulsory powers\nthe erosion of the private\nshould be sought to prevent\ntenant.\nAt I.C. many of us work\nand live in the Royal\nBorough of Kensington and\nChelsea. The Borough Council has the worst record in\nthe country for disregard of\nits poor applying a rent\nsubsidy of \u00a360,000 compared with Camden, in\nmany ways a similar\nborough, whose rent subsidy is \u00a32m. Also 85% of\nthe Council members have\nadmitted in public interview to supporting Enoch\nPowell.\nFashionable\nThose who live in Notting\nHill should consider the\neffect of their tenancies.\nStudents are willing to pay\n\u00a316 or so for flats that a family could afford less than\nhalf that amount for. Landlords can get large increases\nin their income as a result of\nfor even more profitable\nletting in an area made acceptable or even fashionable\nby middle class students.\nThe rest of us should consider giving assistance to\nthe various organisations\ntackling the problems, and\nnot only to those such as\nthe Housing Trust that\nrelieve the Council of their\nresponsibility. The people,\nand especially those marvellous children deserve to\nbe saved.\nAfter many ups and\ndowns during last term the\nGolf Club has finally managed to find its way back\ninto Hendon G.C. Hendon\nGC. have offered ICGA\nmembership but have imposed several conditions on\nthis membership; the decision whether or not to accept this offer must lie with\nthe Club members and will\nbe discussed at the AGM of the Club, which will be\nheld in Committee Room C on Friday, 23 May.\nLeague Leaders\nDuring this term the Club\nhas managed to play 3\nmatches against Portsmouth\nCollege of Technology, University College and the University of Surrey, the results\nof these matches being a33 draw and 5-1 victories.\nThese results and the fairly\ngood record of the Club so\nfar mean that IC now head\nthe South East Universities\nGolf League and since not\nall the other Colleges will\nbe able to complete their\nfixture lists the prospects\nlook quite bright.\nThe ULU Golf Championships took place on Tuesday\n20th May and IC were\nstrongly represented with\ntwo four-man teams.\nI.
