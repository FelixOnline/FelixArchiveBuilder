It's a lot bigger inside.\nElections Update\nBY ANDREW TSENG\nThe race for Imperial College\nUnion sabbatical posts has gained\nmomentum this week.\nWith only a few hours to go\nbefore papers come down, the\ndeclared candidates for President\nare: Kamran Bashir, Lucy Chothia,\nDave Cohen and Paul Thomas; for\nDeputy President (Finance &\nServices): Timothy Brown and\nDaniel Look; for Deputy President\n(Clubs & Societies): Ian Parish and\nMark Baylis; for Felix Editor &\nPrint Unit Manager: Owain\nBennallack and Joe McFadden.\nFollowing speculation reported\nin last week's Felix, all those\nrumoured to be interested in\nstanding have, except the Royal\nCollege of Science Union (RCSU)\nPresident, Rhian Picton. However,\nat the time of going to press,\nsources close to Ms Picton have\nsaid that she is still considering\nstanding for the Presidency.\nThe battle for the Deputy\nPresidencies, which some thought\nwould be uncontested, have also\nbeen the subject of deliberation. In\nthe bout for title of Deputy\nPresident (Clubs & Societies), Ian\nParish, ex-Aero Soc Chairman, will\nput up a strong fight. Proposed by\nthe former City & Guilds College\nUnion (C& GCU) President Kate\nDalton, he promises to be a strong\ncandidate. Opposition comes in the\nform of Mark Baylis from Materials\nIII. Strong on management and a clubs and societies enthusiast, he is\nbeing proposed by another\nMaterials scientist, Mr Kheir.\nIn the election of Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services),\nDaniel Look of Geology III has\nannounced his candidature.\nCurrently Publications Board Junior\nTreasurer and ex-Head of Discos at\nIC Radio, Mr Look should provide\nsturdy opposition to Timothy\nBrown from Computing.\nPapers came down on\nWednesday for the C&GC U elections. The candidates are: for\nPresident: Fiona Grandison (Chem\nEng II); for Vice President: Jim\nSpender (ISE I) and Richard\nOussedik (MAT I); for Publicity\nOfficer: Sarah Thomas (Chem Eng\nI); for Academic Affairs Officer:\nEric Fosdike (DoC I); for Hon Sec:\nTammy Atkins (EE I); for\nEntertainments Chairman: Lewis\nMacleoud (EE I); for Guildsheet\nEditor: Tim Walls (DoC I),D Tindall (Civ Eng I); for Honorary\nJunior Treasurer: Paras Sidapara\n(DoC I), Gareth Parry (ME I); for\nCGC A Representative: Mark\nWalton (Chem Eng III), Su Purdom\n(ISE II); for Dept Soc Officer: A.M. Easwaran (DoC II), Ben Maxwell\n(ME I). With the introduction of the joint\nICU/Security Swipe Card for first\nyear students, Guilds will be\npioneering the new system of\nvoting which will then be used in\nthe ICU sabbatical elections.\nSpeaking to Felix, Paul Griffiths,\nPresident of C&GC U, said: \"those\nwho have been standing appear to\nbe a really enthusiastic bunch.\"\nThe Constituent College Unions'\nincreased profile this year has also\nbeen reflected in the R CSU elections. At the time of going to press,\nthose standing are: for President:\nEmma Holmes (Chem II); for Hon\nSec: Chris Louis (Chem I); for\nHonorary Junior Treasurer: Chris\nBragg (Physics I); for Academic\nAffairs Officer: Matt Szyndel\n(Physics I). BY LYNN BRAVEY\nDebate between students and\nImperial College Sports Centre has\nreopened after the resignation of\nManager Carolyne Osner. Rumours\nthat she left, dissatisfied with\n'College management' have been\ndismissed by Assistant Manager\nColin Wilson. \"She has just taken a logical step up the promotional\nladder. Carolyne has taken a new\ncareer path and taken a post at a private health club. It's the only\nthing that she hasn't really done in\nthe leisure field.\" Ms Osner was\nmanager of the Sports Centre over\nthe period of its refurbishment and\nleft on the 11th of February.\nThe Centre has been a source of\ndebate since the last Union General\nMeeting ( U GM). Students\ncomplained about prices and overcrowding due to use by the public.\nOne student commented:\"It gets\nridiculous. You pay to use the\nweights but you spend half of the\ntime queueing because members of\nthe public are using them. It's a waste of time even attempting to go\nswimming at the weekend because\nthe pool is packed with little kids.\"\nColin Wilson commented:\"The\nprices are extremely competitive in\ncomparison to other universities.\nThe overcrowding problem is\nmainly due to the small size of the\nfacility. The public are encouraged\nto use the centre at off peak times\nwhen students are not using it as\nmuch.\"\nCharlie Leary, Deputy President\n(Clubs and Societies), told Felix:\n\"The fact is the Union took out a substantial sized loan from the\nHarlington Trust to pay for the\nrefurbishment. The Sports Centre is\ncurrently running at a loss and the\nmoney brought in from outside\nusers is needed to keep the Centre\nopen. It's a shame it has to be this\nway and if anything else could be\ndone it would be.\"\nDisabilities\nOfficer\nImperial College's Disabilities\nOfficer has had a change of office.\nLoretta O 'Callaghan can now be\nfound in Room 324 of the Sherfield\nBuilding (at the rear). Her new telephone number is extension 3455.\nThe deadline for letters is Monday, 6pm "

Shhhhh...no one's looking and I won't tell if\nyou won't.I 've slipped my column in over\nTintin's; not easy as it's15\"( and the result is\nalready more juvenile innuendo than you can\nshake a stick at). What you lose in quantity was\nall the quality you had...Anyway, what's he got\nin his bag then, eh? Sweets, puppies, a handful\nof marbles? Some singles perchance?\nThere must be fresh air blowing by 'cos\ninstead of the Aunts and Snowy panting we have\na new single by Sting: 'Nothing 'bout Me'. Moo\nsays of it: \"Sting meets Seal in these funked-up\nremixes...but really not one fit for mellow tracks\nlike 'Lose My Faith'. Is Sting short of\nimagination, do sh or are A&M desperate to turn\nhim into MC Sting?\" Err...yes, yes and isn't he?\nCamille's been revving up her fanzine but\nshe still has time to tell us that Omnivore's12\" is \"easily overlooked bio music from Mars. A myriad of organ om orphic textures at times with\nchunky beats.\" Coming down, she says of Sub\nSub's 'Respect': \"Slapstick, happy-go-lucky\ninanity.\" That's an eee hh uhh hh then?\nIn case you're not familiar with the system,\nyou come in, choose your single, review it and\nkeep it. So why didn't Guy trust me? His My\nLife Story affection was becoming more than\neccentric and now he's got his desserts. 'Funny\nHa Ha' it is, apparently - in fact he elaborates:\n\"After the gorgeous swaggering Kinks-with orchestra pop that was 'Girl A, Girl B, Boy C, they unleash a terrible disappointment. The\nformula is the same and yet the punch and\nsparkle of the first single is lost...Avoid.\"\nHow much is cheese worth anyway? Freddie,\nyou're worth more than a pound of Cheddar to\nus! Who else could sum up the above Baby\nChaos' 'Buzz' as succinctly? \"One of the rare\ninstances where to categorise something is to\nadequately describe it. This is 'Indie Rock'very good.\" Cool.\nMy sister's band was called My Spiral Mind.\nOnly fifteen, she sold the name to a welsh Lee\nRoth like-the-look-of at school. Dunno what the\nInspiral Carpets would have made of it - soul\nsister or sue-the-mother? Anyway, The Pear\nsays of 7 Want You': \"Another double single\nwhich differs from the forthcoming LP with\nMark E. Smiths backing vocals adding a strange\ntwist to a very good song. Hints at 'Devil\nHopping' being a bit good.\" Gasp for air!\nThe Carpets a bit good? It is all change! \"See\nyou,\" said Owain, as he scarp ered to the door.\nSenseless Things\nPeel Sessions\nRight methinks, it's time for a bit of history. In\n1987 a group of four Twickenham lads, literally\nburst out of their garage into the London clubs.\nThey were clearly infatuated with the Buzzcocks\nand the Clash, and this led to some joyous\npunk ed out blasts. Fortunately John Peel had the\nworldly wisdom to record their first session in\nMarch 1988.\nBy 1990, the 'Things had moved on with\nfronts man, Marks Keds, listening more closely\nto his Replacements and Hiisker Dii records,\nfinding an increased level of pop sensibility.\nThankfully Mr Peel was there again so golden\ntrash-pop nuggets like 'Is It Too Late?' were\nadded to the already impressive collection.\nEarly 1993 and the band had matured\nimmeasurably. Lyrical matter had progressed\nfrom teen-angst to homophobia and racism,\nwhile musically they'd finally discovered those\nmissing metal edge. Result: the jaw-dropping ly good 'Empire Of The Senseless' album...but\nwhere was Mr Peel? Nevermind 'cos he\neventually invited them in for another turn. They\ndidn't want to play metal anymore and opted for\nbalanced pop-rock ditties like 'Jerk' instead.\nWhat's more they still sounded good. So who\nneeds history, here's to the future. (8) Vik\nThinking Fellers Union Local 282\nSausage Machine at Russell Arms\nOn a bitterly cold Valentine's day, the Sausage\nMachine club reopened at a new venue. Hail the\nRussell Arms...here's a pint for the future.\nThe relationship between music and film has\noften been symbiotic; whether parasitic is\narguable. With Barry Adamson, and now the\nTindersticks, soundtracks for unseen films have\nbecome an interesting prospect. Native to San\nFrancisco, TFUL282 st(r) ay well-off the beaten\ntrack with their avant-noise experimentation,\nacknowledging different film genres and\nbasically having a laugh.\nTheir surreal and hypnotic guitar antics\ncreate a Can-like drone: a menagerie of distorted\nfragments; while the galloping guitars of 'The\nColor of Morricone' stir up the gunslingers'n' deserts of the western. The balancing of the\nbass-heavy Cop Shoot Cop sound with inter cut guitar punctuation s and warped fairy tale\nlullabies bring to mind the contrast of Yo La\nTengo. Ultimately creating the sound of heaven\nand hell overlapping.\nTFUL282 have an endless list of influences\nfrom the audio-visual mediums, but are\nultimately their own bosses; a collective\npowerhouse of ideas using music to draw out\nour subjectively flavoured but objective images.\nVivid and entertaining. Camille\nUzi\nSleep Asylum\nIt wasn't so long ago that my world first heard\nThalia Zedeck - Come's 'Eleven:Eleven' is now\na recognised (although criminally underplayed)\nclassic artifact from the grunge generation.\nRolling Stones style blues played with the\nrampant in ces san cy of the new guitar re-revolution. A shame they're so appa ling live.\nUzi are dead, however, and this re-issuing\nclearly hopes that with Thalia's new infamy it\ncan achieve a second coming. Or perhaps, less\ncynically, somebody decided that for posterity it\nshould be taken from word-of-mouth and\ntreasured bootleg to CD eternity. A six track\nmini album, it features the same harrowed\nvocals, plundering the lyrics for all the soul their\nworth, but guitars more Rollins then Richard's. Oddest of all is the back-beat. Electronic\ndrums lend a Berlin (remember 'Take My Breath Away'?) feel to the proceedings. Well,\nthis was 1985. The walls come down, nothing's changed. Excellent. Owain\n...freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose...\n\n"

    "content": "18 Opinion\nEditorial\nThe 'E' Word\nYep, the sabbatical election process is under\nway for this year. Papers come down in a few\nhours and candidates will be making sure they\nare fully seconded and no-one has crossed their\nname off at the last minute. Stress and paranoia\nare beginning to take a hold as everyone is\nwatching everyone else and no-one wants to\ngive anything away about their tactics or ideas\nEach candidate is trying to figure out the best\nway to get as many of the groups around college\non their side as possible.\nA number of the candidates have been into\nthe Felix Office to book printing slots for their\npublicity. It's an interesting thing to experience.\nThey are so worried about anyone else even\nglimpsing their publicity. \"Should I put it in an\nenvelope or will it be OK as it is?\" \"Are you\nsure no-one else will see it?\" So much stress and\nparanoia and the campaigning hasn't even\nstarted yet.\nAlthough the candidates will deny it, electioneering is already taking place. Any chance\nthey get to talk to someone about their ideas for\nnext year, they'll take it. Some are taking the\nangle of \"What do you want me to do for you\nnext year\" and some are asking \"What do you\nthink of this idea?\" They'll make all sorts of\npromises based on this in their manifestoes, but\nI 'll bet that a lot of them will be for vote-gaining\npurposes more than anything.\nLook out for mentions of St Mary's.

    "content": "16 Imperial College Union\nThree Wise Monkeys Speak Again\nDeputy President (Finance & Services) President\nMoney\nAs I said in my last report, budgets are a big\nthing in my life right now (it's a sad job, but\nsomeone's got to do it). This means balancing\nclubs & societies requests for funding with what\nmoney is likely to be available to pay for it. Not\nan easy task. I am working on getting the\nfunding to further improve the services which\nwe offer.\nTrading\nThe bar cellar has recently been refurbished,\nwith new-f angled equipment for storing and\nserving the real ales being installed (for free!) by\nthe breweries. The bar manager is very proud of\nall this and suggests that everyone should come\ndown and try it out. We are also working on a number of other things behind the bar, mainly to\nimprove safety.\nWhile I'm on the subject of blowing our own\ntrumpet, Da Vinci's is still selling freshly made\nbap s and baguettes to order from only 90p at\nlunchtimes.\nThe Bookstore is, as ever, doing well.\nIf you have any comments on our trading\noutlets (ranging from the price and quality of\nSport\nMany of you may not be aware, but the Sports\nand Leisure Manager of College, Carolyne\nOsner, has left. I would like to take this\nopportunity to say that the Students' Union is\nvery sorry to see her go. Carolyne always had\nthe students' interest at heart and maintained a very important communication link between\nCollege and the Union.\nI am yet to hear what College intend to do in\nreplacing this position. I will be suggesting to\nthem that sports are underrated by College and\nthat there should be a separate sports department\nwith a Director of Physical Education\ncontrolling it. I do not feel that Imperial is rated\nby other establishments as good in either\nfacilities or quality of teams. This is a situation\nthat could easily be put right as the two are\nintegral ly linked.\nRoom Booking Problems\nSome societies have been booking rooms and\nnot tidying up after themselves. This leads to\nwhat we sell to our standards of service), please\nlet me know - either by coming into the Union\nOffice or by dropping me a note. We are here to\nserve the students, so all feedback is welcomed.\nNew Minibus\nOur new minibus should arrive sometime next\nmonth, as soon as they've finished building it.\nUnfortunately, the IC Trust decided not to give\nus any money towards a second new one (boo\nhiss), so we won't be ordering that just yet.\nOur Transport Officer, Hans Rutlin, is\nretiring soon (something to do with finishing his\nPhD I think), so we will need a successor soon.\nThe job involves looking after our fleet of\nminibuses, which is mainly taking them down to\nthe garage when necessary and getting irritated\nabout people who crash them. It requires a reasonable amount of commitment, but one of\nthe perks is free use of the minibuses when they\nare not being hired out to clubs. You have to be\nover 21 (so you are insured to drive the\nminibuses), so the post is normally held by a post grad. If anyone is interested, contact Hans or\nmyself via the Union Office to find out more.\nextra cleaning costs being incurred and this will\nbe charged to the society responsible. I must\nstress that any society using a room must leave it\nin the same condition that they found it. In the\ncase of College rooms I cannot argue for\nsocieties to get priority booking if they abuse the\nrooms and thoroughly irritate College staff. Any\noffenders from now on will have their right to\nbook rooms removed.\nSabbatical Candidates\nI have spoken to three potential candidates for\nthe post of Deputy President (Clubs & Societies).\nInternational Nite\nI have attended several meetings concerning the\norganisation of International Nite. This is a major cultural event and always attracts a very\nlarge audience. It involves a cultural show, a food fair, disco and a band. There has been an\nimmense amount of work put in by the Overseas\nStudents' Committee Executive and thanks must\ngo to them for all their hard work.\nElections\nThese are well underway, dates are set and\ncandidates are standing. Times and dates for\nyour diary: Hustings at South Kensington are on\n8th March, 6pm, Union Lounge. At St Mary's, they will be at 6pm,10 th March in the bar.\nRemember that this is your chance to question\nthe candidates on any part of their election\ncampaign, be it policy, intentions, plans or\nviews. Make sure you see them in action.\nVoting will be in departments on the 14th and 15th March. It lasts from 9.30am to 5.30pm each day. You only get this chance once a year,\nso make it count. As stated last week, you have\nto have a valid, working Union/College or\nCollege Swipe card. If you haven't or aren't sure that yours is working, go and see Security\nin the entrance of the Sherfield building.\nIf anyone is thinking of standing, you have\nuntil 6pm today to get yourself fully proposed\nand seconded. Currently at the date of writing\n(18/2/94), there are three candidates standing for\nPresident, one for Deputy President (Finance &\nServices) and two for Felix Editor. Although a number of candidates have expressed an interest\nin Deputy President (Clubs & Societies), no-one\nhas yet to sign up their intention.\nBasic Medical Sciences\nCurrently there are plans in the offing to look\ninto a possible merger between St Mary's Medical School and Charing Cross Medical\nSchool. The pre-clinical teaching could be based\non the South Kensington campus. This would\nmean changes to existing medical arrangements\nand to the South Kensington campus. I have\nbeen a member of a working group looking into\nthe optimum size of any possible medical school\nand it's implications on the college as a whole.\nThis I will report on in detail, at the meeting.\nProjects nearing completion:\nMemorandum of Understanding\nWe are hopefully in the last round of negotiation\nwith College in this 'Heads of Agreement'\ndocument. It sets out what the Union is responsible for, lines of communication, areas of\nauthority and generally clears away grey areas\nthat have caused misunderstanding in the past.\nConstitution\nThis should be completed by the meeting and a full report can be made there.\nEmployment Bureau\nI have brought this up in the past. During this\nmonth, I have visited Kings 'Unistaff, an\nagency system that has been running for the best\npart of a year. At the earliest opportunity, I would like to put a proposal to the Union to see\nif this would be beneficial to IC students.\nReports by other Union Officers will\nbe available at the UGM\nDeputy President (Clubs & Societies)\nThe UGM will be held at 1pm this Friday in the Union Lounge\n\n"

    "content": "Clubs and Societies I)ll ll lli9 W% ll ll lli HI Neon Nights in\nWindsor\nForest\nVerdi's Falstaff is the autumnal comic\nmasterpiece that crowned the collaboration\nbetween the composer and the poet Arrigo\nBoito. The libretto is based on Shakespeare's Merry Wives of Windsor, and also draws\nsketches of the lecherous knight from Henry IV\nParts I and II. It is an opera of extraordinary\ndelicacy, the music and drama in fragile but\nideal balance. Subtle and acute treatment is\nrequired and all too frequently lacking, as\ninterpreters are seduced into inflating the comic\naspects into crudity, or underlining the pathos\nand stifling the work's vitality.\nA tall order then, but great works survive and\nflourish through great exponents. On the present\nevidence Andrew Litton, making his debut with\nthe English National Opera, has a way to go\nbefore he can claim mastery of this score. His\nconducting was unrelieved ly brash and solid,\nshowing a surprising lack of sensitivity to the\nairy deftness so essential in this most intimate of\nmusical portraits.\nThis also had the unfortunate consequence of\ncompromising the performances of the lively\nand talented cast assembled for this revival of\nDavid Pountney's org in al1989 production.\nHowever, Benjamin Luxon's corpulent, wingless\ncupid, painted with bright if rather broad strokes,\n' 'By Jove, it's lucky I 've got six pillows under this doublet!''\nBenjamin Luxon thwarts Janice Cairns' self-defence skills. (Photo: Sue Adler)\nis a difficult creature to submerge for long, and\nappropriately dominated the stage.\nDespite this, my abiding memory of the\nevening will be of the magnificently supernatural evocation of Windsor Forest in the final\nact. As the moonlight steals over the aged limbs\nof Heme's massive oak, and Falstaff anxiously\nwaits beneath its foreboding bulk, a green\nfluorescence courses slowly into every branch\nmaking it almost throb with life! A thrilling\nmoment perfectly echoing the musical imagery.\ni qq y The Coliseum, St Martin's Lane, WC2. 071 836\n3161. Tube: Leicester Square. Until 29th March.\n'Degenerate' Masterpieces\nDecca's Degenerate Music series features works\nbanned by the Third Reich. In Nazi Germany the\nlabel 'degenerate' was applied to any music\ndisplaying the influences of serialism or jazz,\nand also anything written by Jewish composers.\nThe latest opera in Decca's series belongs to the\nlatter category. Berthold Goldschmidt's Der\nGewaltige Hahnrei (The Magnificent Cuckold),\nin its premiere recording conducted by Lothar\nZagrosek, tells the bizarre, trag i comic story of\nBruno, who becomes so obsessed with the\nthought that his wife might be unfaithful that he\nforces her into adultery to end his uncertainty.\nThe accompanying booklet forgoes the listing of\ninfluences (\"the cheapest branch of musical\ncriticism\") but prospective listeners might like\nto know there are echoes of Kurt Weill,\nProkofiev and Richard Strauss. There is also an\nabundance of first-rate tunes and memorable\nideas\u2014try the beginning of track 5 and track 6\non the first disc. This is one of those gratifying\nworks that delight at first acquaintance yet\nreveal more with each subsequent hearing. My advice is, go to e.g. Covent Garden Records, ask\nto sample Der Gewaltige Hahnrei (\"as featured\nin Felix\") on the headphones, and hope they\nforget about you.\nGoldschmidt, in his nineties, is not only still\naround to enjoy the renewed interest in his\nmusic, but is still composing. Far less fortunate\nwere the Czech composers Pavel Haas and Hans\nKrasa, who both went to the Auschwitz gas\nchambers on the same day in 1944. On the other\nrecent Entartete Musik disc, the Hawthorne\nQuartet play Kr&sa's string quartet, and the\nsecond and third string quartets by Haas. The\nKrasa is somewhat elusive, but both works by\nHaas are full of invention: try the captivating\nopening of his second quartet, or the first\nmovement of the third, with its wonderful\nsecond subject. The playing is beautiful and the\nrecording near-ideal.\nA much better-known Czech composer is\nBohuslav Martinu. I admire his symphonies very\nmuch, but unfortunately can only give a lukewarm welcome to an intriguing selection of\nhis vocal music from Supraphon. The main item,\nThe Spectre's Bride, gives the impression of\nhaving been composed in a hurry by a master\ntechnician. There are a few flashes of\ninspiration, but little that stays in the memory,\ndespite the commitment of conductor Jiri\nBelohlavek and the idiomatic Prague Symphony\nOrchestra. The soprano and bass soloists have\npleasant voices, but manage to put almost no\nexpression at all into what is (or should be) a ghoulish tale of zombie abduction. The silver\nlining on this disc is the delightful opening\nwork, the early Magic Nights.\nPatrick Wood\nThis week's theatre reviews are on page 13\n\n"

    "content": "Feature 5';\nAn Irishman By Any Other Name\nTony Grew examines Hollywood's penchant for Honorary Irishmen.\n'In the Name of the Father' is one of those films\nwhich practically courts controversy. The more\ncynical among you may imagine this to be a deliberate move by the film makers, or more\ncorrectly the film's backers, to help raise its\nprofile and consequently its box office takings.\nIf this is the motive then it has certainly worked;\n'In the Name of the Father' has taken a very\nhealthy $22m in the US since its release there a few months ago.\nThe story of the Guildford Four should be\nstraightforward enough and many of you are\nprobably aware of the details of this undeniably\nscandalous miscarriage of justice. After the\nhorrendous pub bombings in the commuter town\nof Guildford, the police were determined to\ncatch the terrorists responsible as soon as\npossible. The press and public were, as Emma\nThompson's character bellows so histrionic ally in the movie, 'baying for blood'.\nGerry Conlon, surely one of the most unlucky\npeople on the planet, is arrested on suspicion of\nthe massacre and confesses under intense mental\ntorture by the police. On top of all this his whole\nfamily in England, including his father who had\ncome over to try to secure his release, are\narrested on conspiracy charges. Despite the\ntenuous nature of the key forensic evidence they,\nalong with three of Conlon's friends, are\nconvicted. Only after fifteen years of tireless\ncampaigning and the investigations of one\ndetermined lawyer are their convictions\noverturned.\nYou can imagine how the American studios\nreacted to a story like this. Its got everything:\nhumour, human tragedy, family togetherness and\nsolidarity in the face of adversity, humour, bad\nguys, good guys and bad guys becoming good\nguys.\nI think some people in this country are under\nthe impression that in the 'In the Name of the\nFather' is an Irish film or a British film. You\nhave to take into account where the money is\ncoming from - although it has been directed by\nan Irishman and features absolutely no\nAmericans whatsoever. What it does have is two\nmajor British stars with an immensely high\nprofile in the States. Both Day Lewis and\nThompson have been recent Oscar winners and\nare considered by some people to be attractive.\nThey are good compromise choices from an\nAmerican point of view because although they\nare not Irish at least they come from near there.\nThey also both possess that type of sympathetic\nattitude towards the 'Irish problem' unique to\nluv vies: the whole thing is just so tragic and\nhorrible and of course we are all to blame really.\nIf J. M. Sheridan was totally committed to\nmaking an authentic documentation of the story\nof the Guildford Four then there are dozens of\nvery talented Irish actors and actresses who\nwould have been able to convey the pain and\nconflicting emotions without the method\nposturing of Day Lewis. I have to confess\ncomplete bewilderment at the praise heaped\nupon this consistently average performer. But, to\nget back to the point, the Yanks seem to like\nhim.\nThere have been rumblings from the\nMacguires, Conlon's family in England who\nwere convicted on conspiracy charges, and other\npeople have complained that the numerous\ninaccuracies in the film detract from its force as\nan indictment of British justice and a document\nof the struggle of the four. Bollocks. 'In the\nName Of the Father' is a Hollywood movie; you\nmay just as well expect 'Pretty Woman' to be a searing expose of life on the streets as a call girl.\nIt is not even clear is whether the artistic license\ntaken in the film is the work of Conlon, who has\na bit of a reputation for changing his story, or of\nthe film makers.\nWhat these inaccuracies do is change 'In the\nName Of the Father' from a slightly overlong\nbut essentially worthy boring little film into a classic piece of movie making. You have to\nrespect the work Sheridan has done here. It is\nrepresentative of a trend in movies about Ireland\nover the last fifty years. That is that the story is\nbetter if you tell it this way rather that the way it\nwas. So the fact that the Four and the Macguires\nare tried together makes for a much more\narresting image that if we had to watch two\nseparate trial scenes. Putting Gerry and his father\nin the same cell makes it easier for the father/son\nrelationship to develop. We know that solicitors\nhave no right of appearance at the high court, yet\nthe whole emotional core of the film would be\nruined if the climactic speech was given by an\nextra playing a barrister rather than Emma\nThompson.\nI detect a pattern here. Remember the way\nTom Cruise chose to portray the Irish in his\n1991 effort 'Far and Away'; all shawls and over\ndone accents. Yet he got away with it. So did\nJohn Wayne in 'The Quiet Man'. But when\nKevin Costner, who, like it or not, is one of the\nmost bank able stars of the decade, tried the same\nartistic and factual license with 'Robin Hood',\nhe was stamped on from a great height by\neverybody. It is interesting to note that the\ncharismatic Kevin's next project is a biopic\nabout the 1920s Irish revolutionary leader\nMichael Collins. Will he get away with it this\ntime? Probably, because the subject matter is\nIrish and that seems to make it alright.\nThis is not meant to be a criticism of 'In the\nName of the Father', but rather an attempt to\nstop people coming up to me and expressing\nwonder at the way things really happened for\nthose poor people, and then go on to refer to the\nthree things in the movie that didn't actually\nhappen.\nI really enjoyed 'In the Name Of the Father',\nas my review in FELiX 989 should prove. I even\ncried at the end. But then I got up, surreptitiously dried my tears and left. It was a film,\ndon't have such high expectations of it. It was a Hollywood film in terms of its funding and the\naudience it was being made for, so you, as\nintelligent people, should even be able to predict\nevents and the order in which they happened.\nRemember that.\nThis week's cinema reviews are on pages 18 and 19\n\n"

To\nTorvald, the wife is his song-bird, his toy that he\nthinks he is deeply in love with. Torvald sees\nhimself as the provider, the pillar of strength and\nthe high-principled judge. Nora is happy to be\nthe dutiful wife, though all the time nursing a dark secret, the ramifications of which being\nquite beyond her, concerning how she compromised herself, for the sake of her husband.\nNora uses her femininity to manipulate people\nbut is ultimately seen to be as naive as she\nportrays herself.\nThe drama begins on Christmas Eve, with the\nseasonal promises of goodwill and peace;\nillusions soon to be shattered.\nThe play is concerned with people, their\nfailings and their frailty. Though not addressing\nwomen's lib directly or the feminist movement\nper se, A Doll's House deals extensively with the\nchanging perceptions of women, their various\nroles and duties within society, chauvinism, the\ndifferences between the sexes and the\nweaknesses of both.\nThe drama has a small cast of seven well\ndeveloped characters. Minimal props are used\nSamuel Beckett\nwith great effect and the acting was very\nphysical and expressive. There are ninety\nauditorium seats, so there is a closeness to the\nactors on the small platform stage, that works\nwell with what is, after all an intimate domestic\npiece.\nThe applause at the end was genuine and\nsustained. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and\nI would recommend the play to anyone wanting\na thought provoking evening out. I would\n- Endgame\n\"Finished, it's finished, nearly finished, it must\nbe nearly finished\" - so starts Samuel Beckett's Endgame. Just as this echoes Christ's last words,\nso immediately we are placed in a scene of dark\napocalypse. As the universe finishes with a grey\nwhimper, we watch on.\nOn a stage dominated by an ad hoc throne,\nthere sits a paper king. Hamm is a blind cripple,\nmore of a piece himself than a player. Shuffling\nto fulfil his every wish is Clov. Together, they\ncomplete a meaningless existence. Just as Hamm\nremains uncomfortable in his immobility so\nClov is forever moving. They are in an endless\nmarriage, set times, set conversions.\n\"What time is it?\" \"The same as usual.\" \"Is it\ntime for my painkillers yet?\" \"No.\"\nTheir teeth grinding condition is condensed\nby this dialogue:\nH: \"Why do you stay with me?\"\nC: \"Why do you keep me?\"\nH: \"There's no one else.\"\nC: \"There's nowhere else.\"\nCompleting the happy family are Nell and\nNagg, Hamm's parents. They live in dustbins\nand the past. Seemingly comic in their disregard\nsuggest going with somebody from a different\nbackground, preferably of the opposite sex, who\none is not seriously involved with.

In their dustbins they cannot kiss, only\nscratch each others backs. As Nell wakes up she\nsays \"What time is it my pet?...Time for love?\"\nYes it's a momentary laugh but one which is not\nfunny, like most of his humour Beckett gets us\nto laugh at emotions sinking into a stagnant sea.\nThis is a stage empty of life, signifying\nnothing; these are characters who play against\ntime hoping to lose, to win is only to continue.\nAnd so it does continue until in the wasteland\nthat was earth, Clov spots a child. Something\nnew, something alive. Could this be the renewal\nof meaning? Beckett doesn't tell us, the play\nends, maybe more hopeful but not necessarily\nso. We are forced to examine ourselves, why do\nwe live the way we do? This is a play worth\nevery second, every atom you breathe.\n\"The end is in the beginning and yet you go on.\"\nTintin\nBattersea Arts Centre, Lavender Hill. 071 223\n5063. Rail: Clapham Junction.

Yet\nfor all the rhetoric and red ribbons, Hollywood\nhas shied away from making film's about AIDS.\nUntil now, that is. Jonathan Demme's Philadelphia brings AIDS into the mainstream\nof American culture, intelligently highlighting\nthe discrimination sufferers can face. Tom\nHanks gives a fine performance as Andrew\nBeckett, a high-flying gay lawyer who's fired\nwhen his bosses discover he has AIDS.

    "content": "4 Feature\nA Classless Crossing For All\nThere is a most beautiful thing, handsomely dictatorial on the highways of\nour pleasant land. The pedestrian crossing remains one of the few objects\nwhich reminds us that the automobile's purpose is the convenience of\nmankind, not the means without end it often appears to be. Let me explain...\nLaced across the muscular routes which\ncharacterise the progressive speed of the\nTwentieth Century are the threads of our self\ndetermination. We all have the power to stop the\ntraffic. Here comes a wrinkled walnut of a granny, loaded down with the heavy\naccumulated shopping of life. She presses the\nbutton and for a second the world stops turning.\nMagic. Just as if those dreams had come true and\nall motion revolved around her head.\nMy parents had the\nindignity to hoist on my\nplayground credibility\nthe millstone of a Morris 1500...\nAs a kid, a well brought up child it must be\nsaid, the most an arch an is tic act I habitually\nengaged in was to 'arm' the crossing as I walked\nby, with no notion of crossing over myself. Just\nto see the lines of braking cars, watching as a line of invisible men stepped lightly to the other\nside. Actually it was my potentiality crossing the\nroad and blowing raspberries as it went.\nCars weren't nice in those days. The closest\nyou got to affordable style were the rounded\nlines of the Cortina Mk2. My parents had the\nindignity to hoist my playground credibility the\nmillstone of a Morris 1500. In fact two 1500s sequentially. My desire was for the shark ish line\nof the Capri. Sad in hindsight I now realise but\nthe seeming injustice was enough to build a heady joy in seeing all cars come to a halt in the\nwake of my juvenile attack. Morrises, because\nwe had one, Capris because we didn't., An added bonus was the cry of the then\nimmature environmentalists. \"Think of all that\nwasted petrol\" they would scold me, the oil\ncrisis of the Seventies being within short\nmemory. But although this type of argument\nencouraged some in the phantom crossing\nfraternal, for me the anger of the drivers was far\nsuperior. Who cared about the damage to the\nun renewable fuel resources of the world when\nyou could see Mr Jenkins go a slight shade of\npurple as he waited impotent in his tan Allegro\nas the lights went red? To a small boy that was\npower worth having.\nIf that wasn'ta sufficiently Freudian reason\nfor my attitude to the people's wagon, my\nexperience with the only car I had the misfortune\nto own punctured all my remaining joy. Not\ncontent to need major financial reconstruction\nevery MOT, the red beast, alas a Renault 18,\n(brute) died in a most inconvenient manner. The\nghost was given up one August Saturday, in the\nheart, and I mean the lonely heart, of Norfolk.\nBursts of water rose from the crippled engine\nand fell like black rain. The four friends I was\ndriving home after our holiday took it calmly.\nThey squatted down in a nearby field and\namused themselves by hurling turnips across the\nroad. I felt just like Graham Taylor on the back\npage of the Sun, a turnip head. And yet to return wind ingly to the title, the\npedestrian crossing also reminds us of the\nequality of all individuals. Everyone with a protuberant has the capacity to stop the traffic,\neven the blind. Especially the blind. I live in the\nsame road as a Royal Society For the Blind\nbuilding and the crossing next to that has an\nexcellent feature. To aid the white stick's road\nsafety the lights change immediately. As\nempowerment for a minority this approaches\nStalinist proportions and allows you to wait for a speeding car before depressing the button, thus\ngaining the most enjoyment for yourself and\ncausing the most annoyance for the alloy-wheeled XR3i driver. Hear Kevin shriek!\nOf more concern though is the problem of the\nzebra crossing. Ours is still a mainly subdued\nsociety, when a policeman clears his throat\neveryone feels guilty. When there are red lights\ndrivers behave, but in the freedom of the zebra\nthey're on our own. In fact to legally use the\nzebra crossing the pedestrian is required to\nactually step out into the road. This is a measure\nWhen there are red\nlights drivers behave,\nbut in the freedom of\nthe zebra they 're on\ntheir own...\nof the active spirit. Unsurprisingly though, in\nLondon at least, such behaviour is not practiced.\nIf it were the London taxi service would be on\nconstantly heading off to casualty. Although in\nthe privatised Health Service this could be seen\nas efficiency of the highest order. First the\npedestrian steps onto the crossing. The\noncoming taxi, as is his want, accelerates and\nhits the aforementioned. The now unconscious\ncrosser is rushed to hospital within the\nambulance time guidelines of twenty five\nminutes. Everyone is happy.\nMaybe the days of the crossing are\nnumbered. It is not something within our present\nwheel bound psyche, the male must always get\nthrough. How much more brutal is the\nunderground tunnel which quickly becomes\nurine stained and neon smashed? Or the\noverhead walkway which places the pedestrian\nhigh into the elements? Battered by winds and\nthe ground down by the slow zig-zag g ing of the\nsteps, it is us pedestrians who are put out. Why\nshould we be inconvenienced, or hidden away?\nNo, stand up for the symbol of Utopia in our\nbroken society. A world where the Rolls Royce\nstops for the man in the dirty hush puppies.\nJon\nDon't try this one at home kids! Go play on Queen's Gate.\n\n"

    "content": "14 Reviews\n...Q. fl:. Oi iii il i1ii lf78 Picasso And Eye\nLike everybody else these days, I knew about\nPicasso. I knew he had painted the Guernica,\nthat he had made a bull's head from the saddle\nand handlebars of a bicycle. Like everybody else\nI had never bothered to ask myself if I understood his works - after all, he was a genius\nwasn't he? Because of this when I trundled off\nto the Tate the other day to see their 'Exhibition\nof the year', I didn't even have any preconceptions. I just assumed that I would be awestruck\nby everything I saw, that the relevance of it all\nwould shout out at me from first glance.\nHow wrong I could be. I didn't understand it\nat all. The exhibition itself is a logistical masterpiece - over 160 works by 'The Maestro' have\nbeen borrowed from all over the world, an\nundertaking which took over four years to\norganise, a display so rare that the hordes of\nkeen viewers will be herded in and out like cattle\nat half hourly intervals. It is unusual in the fact\nthat the display concentrates on Picasso's sculptures, most of them rarely displayed in\npublic, and attempts to demonstrate the importance of sculpture in the development of his work.\nSo, what was my problem? I walked into the\nfirst room of the exhibition to see Picasso's early\nwork, dating from 1906 onwards. The paintings\nwere crude, rough, bold, some almost child-like\nin their simplicity. They weren't accurate renditions, they weren't especially attractive. One\npainting was different - the figure was turned\ninto a series of planes, as if cut out of cardboard.\nThis was one of his earliest forays into Cubism.\nThe basic idea behind Cubism was to reduce\nforms into simple, geometric patterns, and it is\nfor this that Picasso first gained his notoriety.\nThis development is shown by his sculpture\n'Guitar' - revolutionary in the concept and the\nconstruction methods used. It was fashioned\nfrom string, wood and cardboard and it had\nholes where there should have been solidity. But\nstill I didn't really see its importance.\nAs I walked through the artist's life, the\ngames changed. Figures were sliced or distorted,\nreduced to shapes and stretched curvaceous ly beyond the boundaries of reality. A pregnant\nwoman became a stick with a bulging belly, a portrait became a jumble of eyes and mouths.\nAnother room was a menage ry of metamorphic\nanimals, sculptures made of old baskets, toy cars\nand cloth. They were witty, but were they the\nwork of a prodigy?\nIt was only at the end of the exhibition,\nenshrouded by Picasso's death, that it made\nThe Studio 1927-28.\nAn example of Picasso's Cubism period.\nsense. I was staring at the sliced up faces and the\nmisplaced mouths, and then I looked up at the\nviewers. At that point I realised the paintings\nweren't distortions, they were representations of\nwhat the eyes really saw before the mind took\nover. All around were the lips, the profiled eyes\nand changing planes. They laughed and frowned,\nthey were two dimensional. All his life, Picasso\nhad been searching for something. Throughout\nthe changing styles, the experimentation, he was\ntrying to paint reality as it really was.\nEventually, unlike anyone else, he succeeded.\nFor this at least, he deserves the title of genius.\nM.A. The Tate Gallery, Milbank.

Free Willy\nStarring: Michael Madson, Jason James Richter\nDirector: Simon Wincer\nFor anyone who's fed up with the boy-and-his-animal-best-friend movies that Disney have\nbeen pumping out since Noah's time, Free Willy\nis a welcome antidote. The utterly predictable\nplot concerns a juvenile delinquent ordered to\nclean up the graffiti he was caught spraying on a whale tank. Surprise, surprise, he befriends the\nwhale and saves it from the machinations of the\nmoney-grabbing evil aquarium owner (Michael\nIronside), who inevitably wears Italian designer\nsuits and drives a big, black Corvette (Camp\nCity, I'm afraid). All while the kid Jesse 'bonds'\n(puke now) with his potential foster parents.\nMichael Madsen (Mr Blonde in Reservoir\nDogs) plays the boy's would-be foster father,\nand the fit Lori Petty is the aquarium animal\ntrainer. Performances are pretty good, especially\nfrom new kid Jason James Richter as Jesse.\nAlthough clich e ridden (much like this\nreview, really) and a tad contrived, the movie\navoids going overboard in its slu shines s and is a lot better than many allegedly 'feelgood'\nmovies. A great film for all you big kids out there.\njk\nPerestroika\nEavesdropping, I learned that a fair few of this\nevening's audience had seen Millennium\nApproaches at today's matinee and were in\ndesperate need for the final fix of Tony\nKushner's Angels in America double-bill. But\nfor those of limited time and finances, a knowledge of Millennium Approaches is by no\nmeans essential, although a quick glance at\nPerestroika's programme might be advisable.\nI'm going to run through the plot so you can\nappreciate the important aspects. So, in a single\nbreath if-you-please: former McCarthy-ite\nstooge has relationship with Mormon - married\nRepublican clerk who loves Leftie - reactionary\ntype who has just jilted the sensitive yet sardonic\nPrior Dillane. Now if I tell you that all of the\nabove are male and that the first and last have\nAIDS you might think you'd died and gone to\nSoap-Opera Hell. Forget it. Although you're\ngoing to get a glimpse at Heaven, feet are\nplanted on terra firma, circa 1985-90. A healthy\ndose of fantasy allowed Kushner to chronicle\nour decade better than fact alone could manage.\nAllegory between the personal nitty-gritti es of life and Universal Truths often seems clever-yet-contrived. Not tonight. The AIDS patient,\ntoo scared to consider a future, and the obstinate\nBolshevik, clinging on to tried-and-failed\nideologies of yesteryear, show movingly that\nchange and progress, although vital, ain't half\nhard for us mere mortals. Divine assistance isn't the solution because Heaven is a place where the\nsole pastime is playing cards. In a stagnant\nafterlife, it provides \"the only pleasure of\nParadise: indeterminacy\".\nWho could disagree? Today we see a rudder less Britain, with Cap'n Major at the helm\ntelling the nation to get back to basics that\nprobably never were.\nFrom slow beginnings where the distinction\nbetween fact and fantasy is sometimes\nconfusing, alliterative ly blessed director Declan\nDonnellan manages to make Kushner's personal\nvision accessible. I don't doubt that there will be\nfuture productions of Perestroika that just don't click. The Company assembled at the National is\nnear-faultless and your grandchildren just won't believe you didn't see this 20th century classic,\nfirst time around.\nRahul\nNational Theatre, South Bank. 071 633 0880.\nTube: Waterloo.

We sometimes stood admiring ourselves in\nthe darkened shop windows or the parked cars\nthat lined the pavement. And greedily stuffed\nour faces, laughing as we sent.\n\"Hey Guys!\" said a beaming face, walking\ntowards us. \"You want to know how to get to\nheaven?\"\n\"Does this involve illegal substances?\" Matt\nmocked him, certain, as we all were, that this\nwas a sales pitch.\n\"No, I'm talking about the saviour.\"\nI laughed.

He came with me, so I began relating my\natheism at him dismissive ly; he would realise\nsoon enough I thought. But perhaps he has a gang around the corner in the estate. He frowned\nand gestured to Ralph, who was still munching\nhis 14 herbs and spices.\n\"Where do you guys like to hang out around\nhere?\" I told him the truth, which was safe.\n\"We don't 'hang out' around here at all\nreally\" I said, drawing out the words.

He looked up.\n\"Look, we'll see you around Chris,\" I said.\nHe smiled sadly, almost to himself. I left him\nthere, and I didn't look back. He was sad, and\nlonely, maybe lost and in trouble. I knew then,\nbut I still didn't trust him because he was black\nand dressed like a mugger.\nI had judged him and dismissed him. Racist,\nsnob.

If you don't know\nwho your hall rep is, find out from a Subwarden\nor me, and then make sure you go and harass\nthem with comments and complaints.\nAlternatively, don't hesitate to contact me,\neither through my pigeonhole in the Union\nOffice, Dave Goddard in the Union Office (ext\n3500/2) or at home in Falmouth-Keogh\n(Southside ext 722).\nYours sincerely,\nJill Dove,\nICU Accommodation Officer.\nIgnorance is\nBliss\nDear Beccy,\nMany of us have been entertained in recent\nweeks by the likes of Marcus Alexander and the\nplethora of letters in the last issue. I was truly\nshocked to learn that, in this modern day and age,\nand in defiance of all moral codes, some people\nquite flagrantly eat and relax in the JCR! Guilt\ncascaded down on me when I realised that I was\na willing participant in this offense against\nnature. Retrograde! Recidivist! Message received.\nFor verily, it is written and it has come to pass\nthat \"in a place which lays claim to 7000 of the\nhighest IQs in the country this is purely absurd.\"\nSo what if nobody seems interested in the\nintelligent circulation of ideas or exchange of\nintellect? Although there is more intelligence\ninside IC than is to be found in other areas of\nsociety, most of us are not and probably never\nwill be great intellectuals. There is everything to\nbe said for the active participation of students so\nearnestly sought by recent letter writers, but\nopportunities are opportunities not obligations.\nI'm not saying \"vacuous is good!\" but it isn't inherently evil.\nSorry!\nJames Mitchinson\nBiology 1\nMore letters can be found on page 19\n\n"

There are 25 overseas societies ranging from the\nAfro-Caribbean to China, represented on the Overseas Students' Committee\n(OSC). The OSC is a major sub-committee of the Imperial College Union and\nserves the specialist needs of the 2500-strong international students.\nBesides supervising and funding the overseas societies, it also co-ordinates\nits own large scale events like \"Freshers' Night\", \"Overseas Week\" and the\nOSC Indoor Soccer Tournament.\nOn Friday March 4th, comes the biggest event in the college calendar\n-\"International Nite '94\". This year, we have more societies than ever taking\npart in the largest scale event yet organised. International Nite '94 kicks off\nwith the ever-popular International Food Fair at 6:00 pm in the Main Dining\nHall, where food from as diverse countries as Japan to Lebanon will be\nserved. The Food Fair will last from 6:00 to 7:30 pm providing the food\ndoesn't run out first! The Fair proved enormously successful last year so\nwe'd advise you to go early!\nAfter that, you can settle down to the highlight of the event, the Cultural\nShow. Several societies will be taking part this year and their performances\nwill show the extraordinary range of cultures that exist here in Imperial. The\nCultural Show has always been enthusiastically received and it has proven\nto be highly enjoyable for the audience and cast alike. The show will run\nfrom 8:15 to 11:00 pm in the Great Hall where seating will be maximise d. However the tickets for the Cultural Show are limited and have always sold\nout well in advance, so purchase yours early to avoid disappointment.\nWhile the Cultural Show is on, there will be two additional events going on.\nThe first is the disco by the legendary DJs, the Underground Movement who\nwill be spinning from 8:00 pm to 2:00 am in the Junior Common Room\n(JCR). At 9:00 pm, we have an excellent Afro-Caribbean band performing in\nthe Senior Common Room (SCR). Throughout this time, the bars will be\nopen till late to give you yet another excuse to stay up and party the night\naway.\nThe price? There are two types of tickets available this year. For \u00a35, the\nFood Fair, Disco and the Live Band are yours to enjoy and for \u00a38, you get\nthe Cultural Show thrown in too! This event has been heavily sub sidi sed and\nwe guarantee that you will never again experience so much for so little.\nTickets are available from the Sherfield foyer and the Union Office and are\nalways sold out, so DO make sure you get yours early. See you there!\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion 19\nThe Case for Arranged Marriage...\nDear Felix,\nI read with great enjoyment each week's dose\nof post-teenage angst that is The Cat's Tale, for\nthey represent so perfectly the disaster area that\nis 20th Century life. If certain theorists are\ncorrect and the purpose of culture is purely to\nfacilitate reproduction, then I'm afraid Homo\nAnglo-Sapiens won't last long. Whereas once\nthere were culturally structured routines for mate\nseeking, we are left in this 'post-sixties-sexual-revolution-world' with the pathetic shenanigans\nthat Glyph revealed. The accepted modern\n'mating game' involves getting totally plastered,\nbumping into somebody who is a) equally\npissed, b) equally desperate and c)( hopefully) of\nthe opposite sex and attempting to cut through\nthe hangover the next day to remember what\ntheir name was/whether you liked them.\nEverybody seems to acknowledge the\nridiculousness of this behaviour and yet it\npersists. Why? Well, as Glyph so eloquently put\nit, everyone wants their 'regular dosage'. He\nchose to reject the cultural choice and hang\naround gay bars, I chose to abandon the allure of\nthese drunken games to lead an ascetic life\n(thermodynamics problem sheets may not have\nthe instant appeal of sex, but I'm sure they are\nultimately more fulfil ing the permanent smile\nworn by the average Thermo lecturer will attest\nto this).\nThere must be better ways of ensuring the\ncontinuation of the species and there are.\nThough I was brought up to believe that\narranged marriages were a bad thing, I can now\nsee their worth - relationships are brought about\nin a structured, rigorous manner and are based\non economics rather than anything as fickle as\nlove. After all, is 'love' really that common? The\nmajority of people seem to be far more\ninterested in five minutes of pleasure than real\nemotions and many students readily admit that\nthey are going out with someone 'for the shags'.\nMarriages based on love and sex have left us\nwith a world of divorces, one parent families and\nfinancial insecurity. Surely it is better to think of\nsex as the by-product of marriage, rather than\nthe purpose?\nThe sad fact is that all around the world\npeople are abandoning cultures which have\nremained successful for hundreds of years in\norder to adopt the amorphous non-values of the\nwestern society - a society which permanently\nhas one finger on the self-destruct button. Surely\nit's time we realised that 'ancient' values and\nattitudes are not necessarily 'primitive', but have\nremained in place due to their inherent success?\nSurely it's time to look at the true worth of\nforeign ideas such as arranged marriage and stop\nturning a blind eye to our own self-obsessed\ncultural failings.\nYours,\nMarcus Alexander,\nMech Eng UG2\nFacts of Life\nWelcome to the\nDear Beccy,\nI apologise for writing about a subject that\ncomes up nearly every year but if everybody\nelse is going to have their say then I don't see\nwhy I shouldn't!I read Mr Davies' recent letter\ncastigating your Editorial approach and style,\nand I believe that he did raise some valid points.\nHowever, without wishing to be dragged down\nto his level, I can honestly say that I have not\nread so much that says so little, for a very long\ntime. Mr Davies arguments are lost in poorly\nmasked self-praise and undermined by a blatant\nlack of knowledge as to how a student\nnewspaper runs. Not just Felix, but any student\nnewspaper.\nI do not want to drag over ground that has\nalready been covered but I would recommend to\nMr Davies that if he is knocked back when he\ntries to get involved in Felix, he should keep\nhammering away. Felix may not always be a welcoming place but it is one of the few places\nat Imperial College where you can meet a good\ncross-section of IC students.\nSMALL ADS Wanted: Cello and Violin to accompany\nsinger/songwriter for occasional gigs on London\ncircuit. Must have good ear and imagination and\nbe slightly less than the full quid. AND like pop\nmusic with a jazz feel. Contact Andy c/o Felix\next 3515.\nDesperately wanted! Absolutely anything\n(pictures/articles/interviews) to do with horror\nfilm maker Sam Raimi and/or his brother Ted.\nAll donations gratefully received. Contact Eliana\non 081-202 1668.\nReal World\nThe media at IC have launched more students\ninto journalism and related professions than I can remember. They all had controversial\nopinions which they wanted people to hear and\nthey all had deadlines to meet. Equally I know\nof many ex-'hacks' who now have successful\nscientific careers, though sadly also having to\nmeet deadlines.\nFelix is certainly not the same as it was when\nI first became involved, and it certainly will not\nbe the same next year. I regret that the same\ncannot be said of every Union club, society and\norganisation. I am NOT standing for any\nsabbatical post, but I would say that apathy is\nIC's biggest problem. It is sadder still that those\nmotivated enough to do something about this do\nnot think a little longer before they act. Mr Davies must have other comments on student\nlife - let's hear them if he can be patient and\nfollow a few simple rules.\nYours sincerely,\nRichard Eyers\nGeology PG\nLost/Stolen: Bright purple ski hat. If found\nplease return to Felix Office, lost in Sherfield\nBuilding.\nStop Smoking Group\nStarts Tuesday 1st March, 5.15pm. Lasts five weeks.\nDesigned to help people to stop smoking.\nContact Margaret Reddoch ext 3099 for\nfurther information or to book a place.\nDear Madam,\nIt seems that Mr Davies, a man of seemingly\nvast editorial experience, needs the difficulties\nof organising the weekly publication of a student newspaper explaining to him in words\nof one syllable. No, surely he must have more\nintelligence than that.\nMaybe he needs to refresh his memory of\nevents some years ago, when childish students\nsubmitted letters to Felix in other people's names, thereby creating the necessity for the\nprovision of Union cards with letters - a practice which has continued. But no, a media\nman of Mr Davies' standing will understand the\npossible legal problems here.\nAnd Mr Davies, who seems so keen on news,\nmust remember that until this year a major\nportion of Felix news was written by one man,\nwho sacrificed two degrees in the process.\nMr Davies, every now and then there will be\nexceptional editors and exceptional journalists\nbut these are few and far between. Most,\nhowever, have limited experience in the fields\nof management and decision making that Felix\nrequires. That is why they are doing the fifty\nhour a week job for a tiny salary - to make\nthemselves better people.\nMadam Editor, I respect the work you are\ndoing immensely, as do most of the students at\nImperial College, if past feelings are anything to\ngo by. I will continue to follow the publication\nwith such interest.\nTo Mr Davies, I am sorry if my sarcastic\ncomments offend you, but maybe it is time you\nopened your eyes and realised that we are not\nliving in the idyllic world in which you still\nreside.\nYours sincerely,\nDavid Henderson-Begg,\nICU Publications Board Chairman 1992.\nYour last chance to see Aladdin on the big screen!

It is designed to give kids a better idea of what University life is\nall about.\nThe Open Day was organised\nand run by the Pimlico Connection\nSociety and featured demonstrations and talks from the staff and\nstudents of many departments.\nPimlico Connection tutors acted\nas guides for the children, who\ncame from six of the schools in the\nPimlico tutoring scheme.\nProfessor David Phillips got the\nafternoon off to a flying start with\nhis 'Flashes and Bangs' Lecture.\nOne member of the audience\ncommented: \"I never knew lectures\ncould be like that.\" (And that was\none of the tutors!). Other events\nincluded a tour of IC Radio, STOIC\nand the Felix office.\nPimlico Connection Society\nChairman, Puneet Singh, outlined\nthe purpose of the Pimlico\nConnection scheme: \"Having tutors\nin schools dispels rumours about\nwhat universities are like and encourages them into higher education.\"\nKelda Bratley, organiser of the\nOpen Day, said that the event was\n\"a great success.

Special concern has arisen\nwith children in the gold-rush areas\nof the Amazon contracting the fatal\nMinamata Disease. The illness,\ncaught by eating contaminated fish,\nis a symptom less disease that\neffects the central nervous system.\nChildren aged between 10 and 14\nyears are the most vulnerable. Gold\ntraders are also at risk, suffering\npoisoning from mercury vapour.\nThe project, funded by the\nEuropean Commission, is being\nmanaged by Paul Docx of IC\nConsultants (ICON). It will help\nBrazilian groups monitor mercury\nlevels in the people and ecosystems\nof the Amazon. People who may\nhave suffered clinical mercury\npoisoning will be located and\ntreated. A vital part of the work will\nbe the adoption of cleaner mining\ntechnologies to reduce mercury\nspillages.

On a wet surface, the African Caribbean,\nSri Lankan, and Singapore societies battled it\nout for the last two places in the quarter finals.\nThe newly formed African Caribbean\nSociety, with their laid back 'South American'\nstyle football, beat the Sri Lankans in a fairly\none sided game. There was some very beautiful\nfootball, but a considerable lack of potent\nstriking force.\nThe Singapore Society also easily overcame\nthe Sri Lankans winning 11-0.\nThe game between the Singaporeans and\nAfrican Caribbeans was the best game played in\nthe tournament so far. The first half was played\nat a thrilling pace, with both teams defending\nextremely well. Not many goal scoring opportunities were created; the Singaporeans hit the\npost and the African Caribbeans missed an open\ngoal and at half time the score was still 0- 0.\nThe second half was more productive. The\nSingapore team made some tactical changes and\nwith some sloppy defence by the African Caribbeans, two easy goals were scored.

The retaliation\nstrategy seemed to be effective in the first 45\nminutes but only slightly. IC had most of the\npossession but were unable to capital is e on their\ndominance. RF H scored twice at the beginning\nof the second half, thanks to firm defending and\nbenevolent fortune.\nYoung Roddy Herris put in a superlative\nperformance on his debut; not so young Chris\nCollison battled with typical resolve; the fasting\nMohammed Al-Said destroyed the key\nopposition player with unmatched precision; and\nthe unshaven Abs Said pulled one back with a hard driven shot. However, Imperial's joy was\nshort lived as the Royals struck once again,\nextending their lead to 3-1.\nSkipper Rakesh Muthoo squandered the\neasiest of chances: This was the kind of stuff\nnightmares are made of. However, where\nMuthoo showed indecision, Anthony Clerc\ndisplayed elegance scoring a clinical goal\ncrowning another commendable passing move.\nThe referee blew the final whistle shortly\nafterwards and in the end, Clerc's effort proved\nto have been too little, too late.\nThe Seconds had to wait another four days,\nfor their away match against Kings College\nHospital (KCH), for something to write home\nabout. The opposition players were all over six\nfoot tall, there were only a few blades of grass in\nthe midst of the mud and sand on the playing\nfield and there was an odour of bovine\nexcrement in the air. Indeed, despite a well\nworked 'haka', IC conceded two goals to the\nopposition within tens minutes of the start.\nImperial remained optimistic as their team\nwas strengthened by the presence of A Futon at\nthe back and Ritch Craig in the middle. Indeed it\nwas Craig who passed a lovely ball to Dennis\nNadarajah and Billal Al-Khatib finished in style.\nAnd it was Craig again who equalise d for IC\nwith a devious shot off an inviting assist from\nMuthoo at the start of the second half.\nTheir tails were up now and a winner came\nfrom the astutely positioned Muthoo who\ndeviated a sweet corner kick from Al-Khatib\ninto the K CH goal. IC then struck again with the\ninspired Al-Said beating the opposition keeper\nwith a teasing diagonal shot. Despite a final,\ndesperate attempt by Richie Dixon to bring more\nexcitement to the game by conceding a penalty\nto K CH, Imperial cruised to a well deserved\nvictory. With four more games left to the end of\nthe season, the possibility of avoiding relegation\nfrom Division One becomes more concrete.\nParachuting,\nIce Skating and\nReeves &\nMortimer\nWould you like to see Reeves and Mortimer for\nfree this weekend?
