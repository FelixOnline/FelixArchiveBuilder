Cross country in February, and last\nweekend for Orienteering.\nMembers of the College club\njoined other oriente ers from\nthe University of London to\nform a combined team.\nThe Championships consisted of an individual event on\nSaturday near Kill in on the\nbanks of Loch Tay and a relay team event on Sunday at\nThe Forest near Alloa. The individual course was mainly sparse forest or open\nfell side, and the mens 8.0km' A' course included 370\nmetres of climbing. However,\nspare time IC cross-country\nrunner and international\noriente er David Rosen,\nproved he had the stamina\nfor this type of course by\nwinning the individual\nchampionships in 53 mins\n16 sec, a clear margin of\n2V2 mins from Pete Nichols of\nLoughborough. Next for\nLondon was Alistair Doyle;69.53 m ins and Richard\nGardner; 70.00mins. These were followed home by C Reid, R All in son and S Webb.\nOn the mens' ' B' course\n(5.4km) first UL runner home\nwas lan McAnulty, 30th in\n69.09 followed by T Murphy\nand L Fawcett. M Welford\nmis punched2 controls thus\nspoiling an otherwise respect,\nable time.\nOn the womens ' B' course\nour only lady competitor,\nDiane Benge, had a good run\nto finish 6th in a time of 76.18.\nNot content with his success of the afternoon,\nDavid Rosen was also amongst the prizes at the\nCe ili dh on Saturday evening.\nAbly accompanied by Diane\nBenge they fulfilled all qualifications in an elimination\ndance and then won the\nwheelbarrow race between the\nlast 3 couples left on the\nfloor. However, all was forgiven when he promised to\nshare around the beer he won.\nIn contrast to Saturday's event, the course on Sunday\nwas a heavily wooded section\nof undulating countryside, one\nsection consisting of a complicated network of\nintersecting forest rides\nseparated by dense under-growth.\nThe UL1 st team was given\na good start when Alistair Doyle completed the 1st leg\nonly Vi minute down on the\nleaders in a time of 33 - 2 8 .\nRichard Gardner then kept\nthe team right' up with the\nleaders on the second leg\nhanding over to David Rosen\nonly 4 seconds down on the\nleaders. However, with our\nbiggest rivals only 100secs down on us at this stage David\nThe winning ULU. Far left Dave Rosen.\ncould not afford any costly\nmistakes. He in fact increased\nour lead to 2\nV2 minutes thus\nwinning two gold medals in\nas many days. Final placings:1. London 102.51\n2. Oxford 104.26\n3. Aberystwyth 112.57\nThe London 2nd team were\nnot so successful and many\nexcuses were put forward\nafterwards. The team of C Reid, R All in son and S Webb\ncompleted the course in a time\nof 197.00; a mere 9 5 mins\nbehind London 1st team.\nOur lady competitor,\nDiane, joined up with Liver pool University for the relay\nrace and ran 2nd leg taking\nover in 3rd place from the\nBUS F individual ladies\nchampion Sue Barker. Diane\nhad yet another good run\nkeeping the Liverpool team\nin 3rd position, but unfortunately\nthe last leg runner was unable\nto match this.

No amount of forewarning can possibly help\nthose being initiated into the\nsport of fell-running/walking.\nThey must battle it out them-selves, fight the good fight -and give in quickly. But to\nthose practiced in the art,\nthere may be ways of\ntackling this masochistic\nenterprise (and succeeding)\nC Hunter, on this fateful day\nin April, thought he had found\naway. Setting off like a bullet out of a gun, he led the\nrace for much of the first\nquarter mile. Hoping that his momentum would carry him\nup the fell with the leading\nrunners, \"he valiantly swept\nuphill at a rate of knots \u2014 but\nno, back he dropped, to\nstruggle at the back along\nwith the rest of us who were\nalready resigned to walking. Nevertheless, several Streakers did win their\npersonal battles with the\nfell, notably Speedy Steve in\n29:13, a minute ahead of\nGary and Hacker. Strapped up\nlike an Egyptian mummy,\nGranny battled resourcefully\nagainst Mr Johnson, who flew\ndown the fell in 33:05. Babyface, benefiting from a week\nin Scotland, ran creditably\nfor 36:26, finally ' beating\nBoyo. Alas, at the back, the\ndecrepit pop star, Alvin Stardust, confined to premature\nretirement, and Smooth'N Easy, in an unofficial time of 52\nmins, were beaten by the\nmountain. Well, there is always\nnext year.\nThat same evening were\nthe boat races. Not across the\nIrish Sea, but teams of 4\nsupping ale extremely fast.\nThe first team won their\nfirst round heat, but were\nnarrowly beaten in the second\nround owing to a cock-up\nin the draw by the organisers.\nThe second team drank steadily someone should have told\nthem it was a race. After\nclosing time at ten pm, all indulged in a mass sing-song,\nhowever, owing to the Offical\nSecrets Act, the remainder of\nthe evening's activities remain sub-jud ice. Finally, we would like to\nthank ACC for providing the\ntour grant to offset the costs of the weekend; and also Manx AC, who organised the\nwhole weekend. The Cross country Club is now signing\noff for this season, but\nrumour has it that they are\nto be re-incarnated as an\nAd Hoc Athletics Club. by Banyface Welford\n\n"

Captain Max Taylor\nwon the toss and elected to\nbat; a very diplomatic decision considering that half his\nteam were late in arriving. He\nthen opened the batting with\nArthur Mulholland and this\npair put on over 130 runs\nbefore Mulholland was out\nfor 54. Taylor carried on his\nbu col ic work and was eventual ly\nout just before lunch for a creditable 82.\nThe run rate of about 100\nan hour was maintained after\nthe interval by Jeh Bashar\nwho scored 51 before the\nskipper declared at three\no 'clock with 244 for 3 on the\nscoreboard. This generous\ndeclaration gave Berkeley ample\ntime to score the runs but they\nwere unable to meet the\nchallenge. Four wickets from\nGeof Thompson showed that\nthe Athletic were not able\nto reply to this total and the\nresult of the game was no\nlonger in doubt. This result\nmeant that two IC sides had\nscored nearly 500 runs in\njust two matches!\nexplain their poor performance.\nIt was a resounding victory\nand a confident start to the\nseason which must be\nconsolidated at Cambridge\ntomorrow.\nTeam:- A Gosh; J Thornback;\nR Young; A Paul; R Pashley;\nJ England; D Millard; C Kulharni; D Bramley; A Hall.\nScorer: Mary Young (many thanks\nIC 2nd XI v Luton College\nScores:- IC 146 Luton 112\nTHIS EXTREMELY close game was decided with less\nthan two overs to go. IC\nbatted first and were quickly\nin trouble at 26 for 2. However\ngood partnerships between\nCausey and Sparke and then\nTrewhella and Hagger pushed\nalong the score to 101 for\n6 at tea. After light refreshment\n(non-alcoholic), IC increased\ntheir scoring rate and despite\nlosing wickets, reached the\nrespectable total of 146.\nLuton started very confidently and briskly put on\n46 runs for their first wicket\nin only ten overs. Accurate\nbowling accompanied by\ntight fielding slowed their\nscoring rate but at 91 for\nfor three the odds were very\nmuch in their favour. Some\nexcellent bowling by Gowlett\nand Sparke caused a sudden\ncollapse in which Luton lost\nsix wickets for only 16 runs.\nSo with* only 5 overs left IC\nneeded to take one more\nwicket for victory. This was\nachieved with only eight balls\nto spare when Gowlett had\ntheir last batsman stumped.\nIn all it was a remarkable\nteam effort for a side playing\nin it's first match of the\nseason. Unfortunately the\nafter match celebrations were\nspoilt by the coach failing to\nturn up.\nAFTER A series of mechanical\ntroubles with the racing\nHonda, the Bike Club has\nfinal ly been racing. Our intrepid\nheroes, Martin Ble as dale and\nNick James, went to the\nVelo Owners Club race meeting\nat Cad well Park, Lincolnshire, on April 3rd, and raced their\nroad bikes against such riders\nas Tom Pemberton and Dave\nEast. Martin was on his\nKawasaki 400 S3 and Nick was on a500cc Velocette\nVenom which had been\nslightly breathed upon by a racing friend, Bill Melville. The practice session before\nthe races was the first time\nNick had been on a track, but\nwhen he finished practice ten\nminutes later, the grin joined\nup at the back of his neck!\nThe pair had each entered\nin two Vi hour high speed\ntrials and in an 8 lap race,\nNick competing in an additional\n8 lap race.\nMuch to the amazement of\nall concerned, neither fell off\nand both actually managed to\ngive a good account of them-selves. As luck would have it,\nthe Velo nearly lost its\nManx\nThe annual Isle of Man\nEaster Athletic Festival, held over Easter week-end,\nwas the focal point of the\nseason's activities for the\ncross-country club, hitherto\nknown as Hyde Park Streakers.\nThe multi-faceted gathering\nof all-stars included such\nwell-known faces as Speedy\nSteve Webb, BSc, Gary Glitter\nand Alvin Stardust, C Hunder,\nand last Smooth'N Easy Donnelly. Wtih such a parade\nof talent, how could we\nfail? The answer to this fateful\nquestion was quickly provided\nby the first race, the Good\nFriday 4 mile road race.\nComprising a steep downhill\nsection for much of the first\nmile, and a corresponding\nuphill section for the last\nmile, the course was obviously\ndesigned to cripple anyone\nwho was not 100% fit. This did not prevent 166 runners\nfinishing; for the Streakers,\nour two ageing pop stars,\nGary and Alvin, had their\nown personal battle which\nwas won narrowly by Alvin(24 th in 21:24). Speedy Steve,\nrecouping the benefits of\nactually knowing the course,\nran a personal best of 22:06,\nand these three valiant middlemen enabled the first team to\nsilencer after the first high\nspeed trial, so Nick had to\nwithdraw from the next event,\nwhich caused him to miss the\nthe spectacle of Martin's Kawasaki \" wheel ie\" away\nfrom the start and lead the\nrace for 200 yards! Later\non, in the second high speed\ntrial, Nick was about to overtake Martin when the latter\nhad a spark plug blow out of\nhis engine which caused him\nto pull off the track. Overall\nthe finish positions were:-1st High Speed Trial - Nick12 th, Martin 15th of 16.\n1st8 Lap Race - Martin 14th of 18.\n2nd High Speed Trial - Nick9 th, Martin 12th of 15.\n2nd8 Lap Race Nick10 th of 14.\nMartin's fastest lap was 1min32 secs(58.7 mph). Nick's fastest lap was 1min27 secs(62.1 mph). For comparison, Dave\nEast on his Velo got round in\nabout im in20 sec and Tom\nPemberton on his500 Kawasaki in about 1min14 secs. Overall, a most enjoyable\nd aVn SL Wilks\nPranx\nfinish in a very respectable\neighth position.\nMeanwhile, a little further\ndown the field, several\nStreakers were struggling to\nhide their obvious lack of\nfitness accumulated over\nthe holidays. Hacker Ellis(23:33) was, for once, reduced\nto the lowly ranks of the\nsecond team, though this\nteam did feature good runs by\nC Hunter (24:38) and Mr\nJohnson (25:13).

For example, the allowance for a single person is currently\n\u00a3675 pa (soon to be more,\nTUC willing).\nThis allowance is split\nequally over the weeks o' the\nyear (tax year, that is) so that\neach week you will have 1/52\nof your allowance as free-pay,\nthat is, not taxed. The weeks\nof the tax year are numbered\nfrom 1 to 52 (5th April onwards)\nand the system operates\ncumulatively. The tax paid in\nany week is calculated in the\nfollowing way:-Problem?\n1. Find total pay to date\n(inc. this week) for current\ntax year.\n2. Find total tax paid to date\nfor current tax year.\n3. Find free-pay to date\n(allowance/52 x tax week no.)\nTax this week -(1 - 3) x35%)2 tax-rate - 35%\nThis is fine if you happen\nto be in full-time employment.\nIt becomes much more\ncomplicated if you are a student \u2014 you will only be\nworking a few weeks in the\nyear. Consider a single\nstudent, working over the\nEaster recess, earning \u00a340pw and returning to college on\n26th April. Rather than (sic) mess\nabout like this the Taxman\nhas arranged a special concession for students\nwhereby they sign an undertaking not to earn more than\ntheir allowance in the tax-year and he does not keep on\ntaking it away with one hand\nand giving it back with the\nother.\nThis does not mean that\nstudents are exempt from\npaying Income Tax (a popular\nmisconception). They are just\nas liable;they just do not earn\nas much as non-students.\nAt all times your tax\nposition is personal to you. Your parents do not affect the\namount of tax you have to\npay although, if you are an\nundergrad, you will affect the\namount your parents pay - If\nthey are claiming a child allowance for supporting you,\nthis will be varied according\nto how much you earn\n(obviously, the more you\nearn the less your parents need\nto keep you).\nAny queries come to the\nStudent Welfare Centre - open\n12.30 - 1.30pm.

EN LY \u00a34.50 single and\n8.00 double.\nNo. 418 Friday 7th May, 1976 FREE! Hardship Fund to go\nBike thefts\nA BICYCLE, belonging to Mr\nRB Jo ce, was stolen last\nWednesday from the rear of the\nChemical Engineering depart-ment. The bicycle, a red,\n10\u2014speed Styer Clubman with\na24. inch frame, is valued at\n\u00a380.\nThe bicycle was chained\nbut not to a fixed object and\nwas removed during the day.\nThis incident is the latest\nin a series of thefts that have\ntaken place recently. Most of\nthe thefts take place during\nthe day and are usually by\nschool children playing truant,\nsaid Mr Dawson the College Security Officer.\nThe College is becoming\nincreasingly concerned over\nthese thefts. Mr Dawson is asking all bicycle owners to\nensure that their cycles are\nsecurely fastened and to\nreport thefts immediately.\nAny information on the missing\nbicycles should be directed to\nhim at the Security Office in\nthe Sherfield Building. Loo\nchangeover\nMembers of the Union are\nhereby informed that from\nMonday 17 May, the men's toilets near the Union\nLower Refectory will\nbecome the ladies toilets,\nand the ladies toilets on\nthe first floor of the building opposite the ICWA\nlounge will become the\nmen's toilets. This will\nremain in force until further\nnotice.\nScandalous says Teague\nIT APPEARS that the\nHardship Fund set up by\nthe UGC in all universities\nis to be phased out'. This is the implication of a UGC directive sent to\nthe College via the\nUniversity of London'.\nOnly those students who\nwere helped by the Fund this\nsession can be helped again\nnext session, but only in\nrespect of the \u00a370 increase\nimplemented this session. It\nwill not be possible to use\nthe Fund to help fresher s and students who have not\nused the Fund before when the\n30% increase in fees is\nimplemented next session. Over \u00a311,000 has been paid\nout of the College's Hardship\nFund to 33 home students and\n127 overseas students up till last February. The Hardship\nFund would have to be abolished once all the continuing\nstudents using the Fund had\nleft the College. The UGC has\nyet to issue a policy statement\nover the question of the Fund. In a letter to Mr Peter\nTeague ICU President, informing him of this ruling,\nMr Peter Mee, College Registrar\nsays there is no indication\nthat this ruling was likely to\nbe changed.\nMr Teague has written to\nthe Rector over the matter. He\nhas also written to the NUS who apparently did not know of\nthis ruling. Commenting on the\nruling, Mr Teague said it was\n\" totally s can du lou s\". He will be asking the Rector to stand\nby his pledge that no student\nwill have to leave the College due to the increase in tuition\nfees.\nMr Davies, the College Secretary, said yesterday that\nhe stood by the Rector's statement. Students in\nfinancial difficulty unable to\nuse the Fund next session\" will be sympathetically\nconsidered by the College\", he said. Hain back at IC\nFORMER IC student, Peter Hain, in conversation last\nTuesday, urged the College to boycott South African goods and break off all links with apartheid.\nMr Hain was speaking at a meeting of the Liberal Club. In his talk he dealt with\nidentification evidence in\ncriminal prosecutions, using\nhis own recent experience as\na graphic illustration of how\nthe law can go wrong. He\nwarned that a completely\ninnocent bystander could be\nplucked out and a\" de moral ising and terrifying experience\", inflicted upon him in which,\n\" facts become dreams.\" Discussing his case, he\nrevealed that the trial had\n\"ground through\" for two\nweeks, spending \u00a350,000 of\npublic money, on the evidence\nof three schoolboys and a fleeting glimpse, by a cashier,\nof the bank robber. He did not\nthink that the cashier, who\nidentified him, was dishonest,\nmerely mistaken. She had picked him out in an identity parade;\non the same day the Evening Standard carried a photograph of\nMr Hain. However, five other\nwitnesses still failed to\nidentify him.\nHe claimed that there\nwere a whole series of\n\"trigger happy\" police prosecutions on doubtful\nidentification evidence and\ncited the now famous case of\nGeorge Davis( OK?). Prosecutions brought solely\non identification evidence\n\" provided more injustices\nthan any other part of the\nLaw\" and he advocated that\nno-one should be charged on\nidentification evidence without\ncorroboration. Mr Hain did\nnot dismiss the notion that a South African agent in London\nwas discrediting him, but he\nthought it unlikely.\nPefer Hain\nAnswering questions afterwards, Mr Hain,a well known anti-apartheid campaigner since his days in\nMech EngI,( he stopped the\n'70 tour), thought that Britain\nshould help fund the South\nAfrican liberation movements.\nRhodesia and South West\nAfrica would almost certainly\nachieve majority rule, and it\nwas better that the transition\nbe sei ft. He saw no alternative\nto armed struggle. \" Unfortunately violence works\", he\nsaid. The future of South\nAfrica he believed to be in\nthe hands of the USA and he\nwelcomed Dr Kissinger' s statement of support for\nAfrican Nationalists. Finally, Peter Hain, billed as \" everybody' s favourite\nradical\", also criticised Jeremy Thorpe's idea of the\nLiberal Party as,\"50 years\nout od ate.\" Anyone believing in the Liberals traditional\nstance, he thought should join the Labour Party, the Liberal Party was not a party of\nGovernment but a\"rad ica' alternative.\" "

    "content": "8 MU X MARK CALDWELL previews a new\nWorld War 1 epic drama \" ACES HIGH\" which has its world premiere on May 17th Good take-off,\nfaultless landing\nQuote from publicity handout \u2014 \"Aces\nHigh is a story about love and com rad ship, loneliness and death. It if about\naction and adventure, and the bravery of\nman.\"\nDo you groan inwardly? Never mind.\nThis film is recommended. A qualified\nrecommendation though. If you regard the\nFirst World War as an historical nicety\nwhich inflicted timely punishment upon\ngreedy capitalist nations, are bored by\naeroplanes and look upon acts of heroism\nmerely as manifestations of misguided\njingoistic fer v our, then may be this\nfilm is not for you.\nFrance,1917. The film follows the\ntrials and adventures of a newly arrived\nofficer Croft, stationed at a front line\nsquadron of the Royal Flying Corps.\nAccounts of life on the Western Front\nare well known and the film bares many\nof the hallmarks of the experiences of\nnewly commissioned officers described\nelsewhere. For instance, the cold reception at the mess on first arriving \u2014\n\"Hullo I'm Croft\"\n\"Are you\"\n\"You're not flying today\"\n\"So it would appear\".\nAlso, fraternizing with the men and\neating their bread and cheese, following\nthe death of a fellow officer during a mission and the subsequent rebuke for\navoiding his fellow officers. Peter Firth of \" Equus\" fame plays the part with\nskill. During a visit to a nightclub in\nRouen, he conveys Croft's sense of\nembarrassment and isolation so con-vinci n gly that at times one almost shares\nhis unease.\n' ACES HIGH' Directed by Jack Gold: Starring Malcolm McDowell,\nChristopher Plummer. Simon Ward,\nPeter Firth'. Screenplay by Howard\nBarker, inspired by RC Sherriff's play \" Journey's F nd\"'. Major Gresham (Malcolm McDowell)\ncommands the squadron with expected\nBritish sang-froid. Nonetheless, he\nnever takes off sober and in a rare\nmoment reveals his sense of utter terror\nto a fellow officer Crawford.\nThis is the first time Malcolm\nMcDowell has been able to use his considerable talents in a serious adult\nrole. He handles the two sides of\nGresham's character adroitly. Crawford,\nturned litter aly crazy with fear so' ,hat\nhe refuses to fly, is played by Simon\nWard. However, there is only one\ndisplayed outburst of madness and\nmercifully it is performed with restraint.\nChristopher Plummer (the \" Sound of\nMusic\" man) plays a veteran affectionately known as ' Uncle'. This sort of\npaternalistic character could easily have become embalmed with sickly sentiment. Thankfully this doesn't happen and the paternalism is controlled.\nJack Gold keeps his cast on a tight\nrein. Notable guest appearances are\nmade by Sir John Gie l gud, Trevor\nHoward, Richard Johnson and Ray Milland. The cast also includes one of\nMalcolm McDowell' s fellow rebels from\n'If..', David Wood.\nIndeed my only criticism of the film\nis the preponderance of exuberant\nMalcolm McDowell\npublic school bon hom mie which permeates\nsome of the film's lighter moments\nalmost to the point of nausea. However,\nremembering that this is a period film, it\ncould be argued that an accurate\nportrayal demands that the acting should\nbe flavoured with the Zeitgeist of the\nera in question.\nI nearly forgot to mention the\naeroplanes. Possibly because although\nthere are technically brilliant and\nspectacular in flight, once on the\nground, they remain throught the film, as they should be, well proportioned props.\nWatergat\n\" All The President's Men\"( Warner\nBros, A) directed by Alan Pakula;\nstarring Robert Redford and Dustin\nHoffman.\n\" THIS IS NOT a film about Nixon\" says Robert Redford whose brainchild the\nJilm was and who was one of the prime\narchitects of the film. He and Dustin\nHoffman play the parts of the two\nWashington Post reporters, Bob Woodward\nand Carl Bernstein respectively, assigned\nto cover the Watergate building break in. When powerhouse attorneys show up\nat the hearing to determine whether bail\nwill be granted, Woodward is curious.\nHis curiosity is further aroused when one\nof the burglars admits to being an ex CIA man.\nThis is when the tek to the President's office really begins.. No one really\nbelieves any more, at the Post at least,\nthat the break in was the work of crazy\nCubans. Woodward and Bernstein follow\n>how it was\nup countless leads in their investigations\nwhich have a habit of revealing facts\nthat an FBI investigation covering 1500\npeople do not.\nAs in all good detective films there\nhas to be an \"informant \". In this case it is Deep Throat played by Hal Holbrock.\nDeep Throat was Woodward's contact\nwho had access to information at the\nWhite House. In newspaper, parlance,\nDeep Throat, was used only for \" deep background\". He was used by Woodward\nto verify or not information gathered in\ntheir investigations.\nThere has been recently a great deal\nof speculation about Deep- Throat and\nwhether he exists. All I can say is that\nthe film Hal Holbrook makes the character\nbelievable with a very convincing\nperformance. Also, Woodward, in an\ninterview with Time magazine last week,\nstated that Deep Throat did exist and\nwould reveal himself one day.\nThe film is well acted throughout with\nexposed\nRedford and Hoffman conveying the\nextreme sense of fear felt by the\nreporters during their investigations and\nalso their obsession with the story once\nthey had begun. Guest appearances by\nMartin Balsam as the city editor and\nJason Robarbs as Ben Brad lee as the\nPost's executive editor provide a solid\nback up. Jane Alexander gives a very\ngood performance as the Bookeeper.\nTechnically this film is excellent.\n450,00 dollars was spent on building an\nexact 32,000 square foot duplicate of the\nPost's newsroom. In fact, so much care\nhas been paid to detail that no car in\nthe film is later than,a1973 model, the\nrubbish in the newsroom is real rubbish\ncollected from the Post's newsroom over\nseveral weeks. They even hired Frank\nWills, the Watergate security guard who\ndiscovered the robbery and sounded the\nalarm, to play himself.\nPaul Ekpenyong\n\n"

    "content": "MU X7 Reviews Theatre Re-examination rewarded\nTheatre Review: ' Equus' by Peter Shaffer at the Albery Theatre\nThe first time Is aw Peter Shaffer's play Equus I found it to be an\nimaginatively staged thriller about the\npsychiatric healing of a boy who committed\na savage attack on six horses. Sifting\ndown to see it again at the second\nrevival of the National Theatre's production by John Dexter (this time at\nthe Albery Theatre) I wondered how the\nplay would stand up now that I knew the\noutcome of the doctor's probing s. Within seconds of the play's start\nI was, again, totally absorbed, but now\nit was with the depth of the piece that\nconcentration on the purely narrative\naspects had obscured. Equus is certainly\na play which, in that over-worked phrase,\nrepays re-examination. It supports,\nthrough the agonising of the psychiatrist\nover his attempts to bring his patient\nback to a 'normal' existence, the idea\nthat normality is deadening and that the\nboy's so-called insanity is really a passion that those of us with empty\nI ives should envy.\nThe doctor, played by Colin Blake ly with a warmth and sympathy that the\naudience responds to, has problems of\nhis own with a wife who, we are told,\nsoon lost any passion she may have had\nand so her husband seeks fulfilment for\nhis psyche, second hand, by studying\nthe primitivism of Ancient Greece and\nits Gods. He is jealous of the boy who\nfinds, for himself, living gods in horses.\nOn paper, in one sentence, that sounds\nbizarre and the brutal crime around which\nthe play is written may seem far-fetched,\nalthough Shaffer bases his plot on a real\nincident, but in the theatre the atmosphere\nof sensuality and worship created not\nleast by the marvellous representation\nof horses by men in simple though\ningenious masks and heightening hooves,\nforces us into the play's exegesis of how\nthin is the line between genius and\nmadness.\nEric Stovell\nOver-abundance of talk\nThe Royal Shakespeare Company's series of Gorky productions, at the\nAldwych, continues with The Zykovs.\nThis is a play that is less overtly\npolitical than much tum-of-the-century\nRussian drama; particularly bearing\nin mind that Gorky became the doyen of\nRussian literature after the revolution,\neven to the extent of having his home\nrenamed Gorky.\nMikhail Zykov is engaged to Pav la Tse lov any eva s; soon, however, his father steps in and declares his affection\nfor the girl. With the aid of smooth talk\nand financial incentive (he is a self-made\ntimber merchant) he proposes a marriage\nthat is doomed from the start. If all this\nsounds a bit far fetched you must\nunderstand that Pav la has spent the\npast five years in the convent school\nand is out of touch with the realities of\nlife. Time and time again she declares\nher belief in love as the true guiding\nprinciple; she fails to realise that the\ntype of love preached in the convent is\ntoo frail a concept to stand up to the\npassionate love of her husband, Antipa.\nOnce Pav la and her mother are\ninstalled in the Zyk ov house hold, she\nfinds that the only person she is not\nafraid of is her erstwhile fiance. A strange change comes over the characters;\nAn tip a paces about not caring for his business; the sour head keeper, sho khin, decides to leave because of Pav la's fear of him. The ability of a passive\ncharacter like Pav la to alter the status\nquo in a group of much stronger characters\nis but one of the threads woven together\nby Gorky.\nA splendid performance, as Mikhail, comes from Mike Gwilym; the eternal\nfloater, drinking too much and waiting\nfor something or someone to turn up.\nMia Farrow plays Pav la with a wide\neyed innocence; whilst Gary Bond appears\nas the correct German, proposing\nmarriage to Antipa's sister more refined\nthan her brother on the grounds that\ntogether they might restore Russian self-confidence.\nIf I do not seem whole-hearted ly to\nsupport this production it is because I am not a great fan of Russian plays.\nThere is here as elsewhere an over-bun dance of talk; as Tarakanov says at\nthe opening of Act II; \" You can't do\nwithout philosophy, since everything\nnas its hidden meaning which we must\nknow\". Next Saturday, May 15, will be your\nlast chance, for the present, to see two\nnew plays by Tom Stoppard at the Almost\nFree Theatre. As its name suggests the\nprices charged at the Almost free are\nrock-bottom; in fact you can choose the\nsum (50p is about average), to suit your\npocket, but you also have to join the\nAmbiance Lunch Hour Theatre Club; this can be done at the door.\nThe two plays are Dirty Liven and\nNew-Found-land and both contain all the Stoppard Tricks of double entendre\npun, Malapropism and obscure literary\nreferences. The cast is headed by a number of well known names currently\nappearing on the West End stage. The performance starts at 1.15 and runs about\nan hour but you are well advised to get\nthere early as a queue soon builds up.\nCertainly this *s something that shouldn't be missed, especially if you are already\na confirmed Stoppard addict and can dispense with lunch for one day. Thomas Stevenson\nMusic Head's heart not in mouth\nMurray Head - Say It A in' t So (Island ILP S9347) After such an impressive debut single\nI was rather looking forward to an\nequally talented LP. Not so; in fact the\nbulk of Head's efforts earn him zero for\nstar quality and three (out of ten) for\neffort.(even by Black Sabbath standards).\nMy name isn't Tony Hatch either1 Outside the title track Boat's Away\n& Don't Forget To Let Him Know are\nthe only tracks to stand out. The other\nseven barely deserve more than the words\ndrab, ordinary & insubstantial. Either\nproducer Paul Samwe 11-Smith & Head\ndon't make music together or Head\nis rather low on talent. Judging trom the\nfrail vocals I suspect the latter. Either\nway, neither producer or artist has made\nfull use of the experienced session musicians on the album.\nA med lee of three acoustic guitars,\ntasteful string arrangement, extensive\nbackground singers and overdubs\ndominates the LP's best track Say It\nAin't So. A beautiful stylish example of\nall that's good in modern music. Bob Weston (acoustic & slide guitars) holds\nthe track together, as he does on the\nLP's other goodies. Boat's Away is a cute un dramatic crib of Cat Stevens'\nLonger Boats, but once you accept that\nit's quite pleasant. Likewise Don't Forget Him Now, a delicate ditty\nenhanced by Sue Lynch' s vocals and some\ngifted piano playing from Murray Head.\nBoth give the vitality missing on the\nother tracks.\nThe album's worst cuts are You're\nSo Tasty, an unromantic soul cover\nversion of We Do It and a mediocre\nattempt at Someones Rocking My\nDreamboat. George Me My could do it\nmuch better.\nTo conclude, if you've bought the\nsingle don't bother buying the LP. Murray Head has, I fear, yet to discover\nwhat he does best. He might well have\nbeen flustered by his first venture to a recording studio, but that's no excuse\nfor.fs land to release Insuncere trash.\n\n"
