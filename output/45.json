    "content": "2 T& LIX\nPROFILE THE FIRST LADY./ This year's First Lady at I. C.W. A., Eleanor (at home)\nRse (at college); Turnbull was born in Glasgow just\ntwenty one years ago and still retains a refreshing Scottish\ncadence in her voice, although it's now seven years' since\na he lived there.\nShe had a very normal childhood - she was a Brownie,\nlearnt to play the piano, collected stamps and even took\nlessons in ballet dancing, although she decided later that\nshe wasn't really intended to be another Fonteyn.\nIn spit* of her Scottish birth and education (the\nRatherglec Academy end the Glasgow High School for girls)\nher reply to the question \"Are you a Scottish Nationalist?\"\nWas en indignant, although possibly evasive \"Do I look like\none t\" On moving down to England, Rae went to Sutton High\nSchool and from there she came to I.C, to read Zoology.\nHere we found that she was a sporting type (\"please, not a hearty type\") playing squash, tennis and hookey, although sha\nsteadfastly refuses to run round Hyde *ark at 7 a.m. and so\nqualify for the I.G. W.S.C. Athletic team. So in her\nsecond year at I.C. she became President of I.C. W.S.C., passing from that to her present exalted position - much to\nher own surprise for she's an unassuming lass. As\nPresident, she is prepared to f if ht for I. C.W^.' s rights\nto the last and keeps its affairs running smoothly.\nIn the likes - and - dislikes department, Rae likes\nriding but not horses and likes pipe-smoking men but not\nENGINEERS' CONGRESS. Students of Ghent Engineering College celebrated the30 th Anniversary of their foundation by inviting engineering students from other countries to discuss the formation of an International Federation of Engineering Students. The aim of such a federation would be to effect a closer association Of engineering students in all parts of the world. It was felt that any international union is good in principle, and would provide an opportunity to study students' conditions in other countries. Study tours of industries and construction were also considered possible. The Congress was conducted according v \u201e\nEnglish procedure, and hence P.A.D. Allsopp, the President of C.&G., was asked to take the chair. He declined, in order to be able to put his own\nviews to the Congress, and an election was held among the39 delegates from12 European countries. The Guild's President did, however, preside over a steering committee to decide on topics for discussion. There was some discussion on whether a federation1 should be formed at all, and it was\n:\nlater decided to set up a committee to investigate the problems of establishing a federation, if one\nwas in fact needed. The Belgian delegates we rr given this task, with instructions to report to delegates within the year. The absence of delegates from Cambridge and\nManchester is regretted, and meant that Philip Allsopp was the only English representative. This Congress illustrated very well the difficulties of obtaining agreement at an international meeting, but at the same time provided opportunity for discussing student life with other \u2022 college presidents.* BO\" IN THE PITS. After a very strenuous term, during which he attended Morphy Day, The Brighton Run, and the Lord Mayor's Show, \"Bo\" has gone into tempor ary retirement following some alarming noises from under the bonnet. He is now standing stripped down in the Goldsmith Laboratory. The\nbody and both' cylinders have been removed, and new big and little end bearings are being fit t fcu to the left hand cylinder. Mess rs.T. Pil kington and D. Brown are doing the job in their sparetime, making the required parts, as spares for a unique car are difficult to obtain. It is expected' that the work will be completed in a month, and that he will appear, as is his oust om, on the occasion of the Engineers Cup\nMatch \"smooth'' men. She's often to be found reading Vogue and\nis interested in fashion and elo the s, but she hate j a knitting.\nA celebration will be held when Hae finishes her first\nsweater; Typically feminine, she likes flower* but im't fond of spiders; and,unusually, she enjoys her work,\nwhich is at the moment a study of parasites on tropical fish,\nnn A thinks badly of people who refer slight ingly to\nparas i to log is xs, When it comes to food and drink, she like*\nDrambuie, Danish blue and tapioca pudding, but, isn't so keen\non chips or the idea of eating frog's legs.\nIn the culture line she's a low high brow with a special fondness for the poetry of W.H. Davies. She wish ee she had more time to listen to music and to read, but finds\ntime to go to the theatre fairly often.\nHer ambitions are to enjoy herself in Canada where she.\nhopes to be going next year and to pass her driving test.\nHer views on marriage are \"just the same as anybody else's\"| enlarging a little, we discover that she wouldn't object to\nbeing married but doesn't want to be tied to the kit ohm sink\ntoo early.\nInteresting experiences in the past,? Well, she has\nbeen interviewed by the Evening Standard quite recently, and\nhad her picture published in the national press (not, she says\nfor the first time). She admits, rather oddly, to having\nserved on a welfare committee with two ladies and a viscountess and she has worked as an unpaid, p' rt-time\nkennel maid eum-dog-trainer - \"only they weren't house-trained\nbecause they didn't live in the house.\" This, we might\ni add.is typical E.R.T. logic.\nRae is often very vague and absent-minded, causing her\nfriends much amusement as she searches her room furiously\nfor the keys that are in the lock any w=y. But in anf\ncrises or difficulty she remains unruffled, meeting the\nsituation with her typical one-sided smile and that expressive\nScottish noise that is spelt \"Och!\" but sounds quite different.\nHer decisions bear the stamp of shrewd oom mon sense and she\nspeaks her mind with characteristic blunt nes*. And when,\nas happens infrequently, she loses her temper - more often\nwith herself than not - the following few minutes are very\namusing for any uninvolved spectator.\nFinally, she hates being asked questions about herself,\nhates people probing into .her character, was only interview od for Felix with some difficulty and an air of martyrdom, and\nwill positively hate and detest reading this \"Profile\".\nMIS CELL ANT Tne City sad Guilds Engineering So oie ty was\nhonoured on January22 nd by a visit from M r.H.

I.C. reached the final of th fU.L.3a side cup by\ndefeating, Sharing Cross Hospital\nPlaying No. 3, Kike Martin convincingly defeated hit opponent 9-2, 10-8, 9-1. From the beginning it was fairly obvious which way the grime would go and Martin was never\nreally extended.\nTony Williams easily accounted for the Charing Cross\nNo. 2 player in three .^ick games 9-0, 9-3, 9-0. Here\nagain the result was never in doubt and it Y/ as rather\ndisappointing from the spectators' point of view that\nWilliams never had to rise to any great heights.\nThe most interesting game of the match was between\nJeff Kenyon (I.C.) and last year'sU.L. Captain\nG. D.H. Shephard, the latter winning 9-4, 10-8, 4-9, 9-6.\nShephard with a tremendous reach produced some amazing\nretrieving shots and this coupled with an unaccountable\nlapse in Kenyon's shots down the walls resulted in the\nHospital's lone victory.

They might, with no injustice, have been\nseveral goals down in the first half, yet, in the end it was\na deserved victory because their forwards could finish off an attacking movement.\nOn their a e cond half from the two teams would have\ndriven spectators if there had been any to distraction. The .ineptness of the play was disappointing especially\nconsidering the fact that l.C. had played so well in raid-week to record a44dr s.w against Westminster Coll. Victories\nare always welcome but little pleasure is ga.in ed from such\ndrab games.\nPlaying in much better fashion\"I.C. drew with Kincrs 1-1\nin aU.L Leaprue match on Wed. 28th. Jan. The result was e true reflection on the game and i.e. must consider themselves\nunlucky in being out of the Cup since Kings' are in the semi-final. Another victory was credited to the First XI (making it eight games without defeat); when playing against the College\nof St. Mark ec St. John the score was 5-1. In a blustering wind the team mastered the conditions in grand style and gave\na first class display of football. Swimming\nFOSTER TROPHY DISINTERRED This cup was last Drought to the\npublic notice in 1905. It had been\ngiven to the college in 1904 as a swimming\ntrophy and was for competition between\nR.C.S. and R.S. M. Clad in sombre,\ndignified costumes, our predecessors\ncompeted for the cup in both these years,\nbut for some reason never again.\nWas it the number of fatalities in the si matches that caused the cessation, or did\ntho- e long-sighted gentlemen foresee the\napproaching rae naoe of I. C.W. A. and shun the\npossibility of being seen in knee-length\ngarb? Whatever the cause, not for nearly\nhalf a century was the cup mentioned; in dee c ve have no record of it, until in 1950 an\n' jb serve nt gentleman in the bar noticed the\nunusual shape of his pot and, since it was\nvery early in the evening, investigated\nfurther.\nVarious Union and swimming club\nofficials have since viewed the find wit u some interest and returned it to its place\namong the empties: but this year we intend to clean\nthe dregs out and return it to its original use.\nThough we cannot hope to emulate our stalwart long-panted predecessors, we intend to hold a gala, wh icu\" ill take place at Buckingham Palace Rd. Baths on the\nevening of Tuesday 24th March. Owing to the slight\ntime lapse since the last gala, the captains of the\n.college teams are having a little difficulty in\nmustering their sides. Large numbers of 'only ju t \u2022\nswimmers are require ci for an event of this kind, and\nany Union member wishing to give his support should\ncontact the Hon. Sec. I.C.

The new board represents\nall Universities in Great Britain.\nB.U.S.B.y. has af fila ted to F. I.S. u.( Federation Internationale du Sport Universitaire) as experience has shown\nthat the International Games conducted by this body are\nkept entirely free from politics.\nThe various organisations represented on the o \u00bb^r< x have agreed that it is desirable that the funds for financing\n3rit ish Universities' teams should be a \"student concern\" and\nthat no public appeal for funds should be made.

    "content": "FKLIX\nCINEMA Golden... arie (Casque D 'Or,. La Continentals until February17 th What do we usk for in a tragedy apart from an\nunhappy ending etc.? iet us consider this question and then ex a raine\" Golden j Va rie\" in the light of the answers,. To begin with, the characters must\nthink and behave ...uch as .we do. even if this introduces an a chr or. is l, for only t nen cant ney c lai u' the emotional( apart from the intellectual) \u20223. apathy of us, the audience. Secondly the ther.e of the story must bear some slight resemblance to modern life. These two points are not of course essential to tragedy in the general sense of the word, but they are very necessary for one that is to affect us . mot lon ally.\" Golden Ka rie\" has both these qualities. Even though the film is set in the1' at is of about1900 the peoples' behaviour and feelings are little removed from ours. The story itself is ageless that of the prostitute who falls genuinely in love b vit who due to the tricks of fate can only have a short lived happiness. But we yet have to find what lifts the film above the general level of competent modern\ntragedy and .^a kes it a work of art. Let us\nsearch. To begin with, a work of art must be well balanced;\" Golden J iar le\" certainly is. The love scenes are restrained, but with no suggestion that the lovers themselves are, there by avoiding the trap that many modern films fall into; that of being emotionally i mpla usable. A good picture of the lives of those in the Paris underworld is painted, and to complete the balance just enough of the sordid side is given to make it realistic. A work of art must be well constructed. Afi lr. which has. many important characters often becomes a collection or disconnected scenes, but\n.here the director has made a masterly arrangement which simply flows. A scene ends with someone\ngoing: out through a door, and the next one\nbegins with somebody coming in through one;\nthis and similar touches avoid letting the action of one scene jar on another. A tune appears in the opening scene, ir which the lovers meet and\ndance in a cafe. This tune becomes symbolic of the love affair, and punctuates the later unfolding of the tragedy, adding another thread of unity to the development of the film. In the same programme is an excellent German film, \"Wozzeck\". This is largely a philosophical piece on the effects produced in a man by the brutal training of the Prussian army. The role of Wozzeck is a double one.\nFrom the point of view of the action,of\u201ethe film he is a German brute, but this is only for a small percentage of the time. During the rest he speaks the philosophical conclusions to be\ndraw rl from the action, there by making clear the intentions of the film, without the use of another character or making it much longer. H.C. G. On the occasions when a particularly outstanding film is showing in London, FELIX proposes to print a review of it by one of several FELIX Film reviewers. In the next issue we shall review a recently arrived French film\" Les Jeux ih ter dits\".

And if the substance of what \"A.R.B.\" has to say is masked by the irritating way in which he says it, no one but himself is to blame for the ensuing confusion.

The opinions of the\ncorrespondent quoted were not much in agreement with\nFelix policy last term, and, worse, the phrasing of\nyour questionnaire attached was biased such that\nsimple replies to each were bound to amount to\ncontempt, of the schemes, .\nI doubt that such contempt and the discontent\nmentioned by your correspondent are felt by the\nmajority of students - since the support of the\nthree simultaneous meetings is Still large. In\nfact the inconveniences have been small - particularly\nI if we consider that these arrangements are but the\nfirst st nge, oom pro raised to suit best the many\ninterests concerned, in an experiment so clearly\npromoted for the students benefit. ( in any case\ntime has been lost, on two days only, that at\nmany other institutions would never be free on any\nweek-day).\nNo one doubts that the lecture scheme can be\nvastly improved by many changes and shifts of\nemphasis. The critics should realize the relative\nachievement of the year compared with the generally\nunimaginative life that is the lot of many students\nwithin this ponderous University machine.\nIf your remarks were put together too hastily\nand at the last moment, Is y mpa this e as this ha*\nhappened before to harassed Editors.

Dear lies dames,\nIt. was with much pleasure that I read your opinion of yourselves as expressed in the FELIX dated23 rd January. I fear you are seriously misinformed about the structure of modern women students. Were I able to see more of the present students, who will be the future womanhood, I might well agree that they are well built, excellently proportioned, de ii gh t ful to gaze upon. women of outstandingly attractive appearance; but they do not1 feel as you feel about the most important things \u2022\nin life. They have thrown off the Sporting Principle with its\" air, light, sun, foliage, space,s cie no e(?), liberty, intimacy, isolation and beauty\" in favour of a Determined Principle with its accompanying smoke, darkness, night, make-up, pace,; ft'1\nartistry(?), liberties, off handedness, company, and\nfilth.

GE\" LOST HOURS' ff ie efforts of the Film Industry to portray Science and Scientists have long been regarded by\nthe victims with a sense of resignation re mini scent of an elderly gentleman being aped by a small boy. So it is that we snuggle deeper into the two-and-threes and grin smugly as the bearded\nprofessor absent-mindedly dressed in pyjamas pours\nsamples from reagent bottles into are flux still. The scene is usually an unnamed laboratory, but\nrecently, sudden fame has come to I.C. in the\nfilm \"THE LOST HOURS\".\nHere a gentleman of doubtful character is described aa \"doing research at the College of Science\". \u2022 'One'as lle nj; mirth la immediately\ndisplaced by avid attention as a plaque appears\non the screen inscribed\" imperial College of Science and Technology\", - the camera then pans\nto reveal that this is indeed the R.C.S. The hero approaches briskly along Imperial\nInstitute Road and disappears into the front door\nof the R.C.S. Eager with curiosity we find ourselves next in one of the new chemistry\nlaboratories where our a usp ect seems to be\ninnocently engaged on a routine qualitative analysis; but it seems also that he has an\nuneasy conscience since he has received \u00a32^000\nfrom the murdered man (who incidentally wan a crook) - \" for research\". This research, it SjS\nsuggested, involved the supply of certain drugs\nwhich, we have already deduced from the story, were administered to our hero in an effort to\nsaddle him with the responsibility for mar der. Here the scene moves from I.C. and, needless\nto say, all turns out well in the end} well, that i a, for our hero and Justice, but what of I.C?(, \u201e 'we are by now Hardened to the misrepresent\n& tion of what goes on in laboratories, but, we\nbelieve, this is the first time that one of a specific group of scientists members of I.C. have been accused of dereliction of their moral\nduty. The film implies that members of I.C. are capable of the abuse of their responsibilities towards Society, and that they are people of\nwhom the innocent laymen must beware.\nIt is usual in all forms of fiction to\ndisguise places and names where any discredit may reflect, and resp on sib it it y for the failure to do so in this case must be brought home to those permitting our name to be used in such a context.\nPeter.

The visit of the Duke of Edinburgh to I.C., reports of which have been circulating in the\nCollege, will take place on Karch 10th. It will be an unofficial function. The Duke is to have\nlunch in the College, and will view selected\nre sea roh projects, one from each of half a dozen\ndepartments. We do not know any further details,\nbut will announce them as soon as they are available.\nIMPERIAL PREFERENCE Mr. Boyd-Carpenter, Financial Secretary to the\nTreasury, announced in Parliament on Jan. 29th that\nI.C. is to expand to take 3000 students by 1957-62.\nThere are about 1650 at the moment. Expansion will take place on sites in the neighbourhood of the\npresent buildings, the College being given top\npriority for them as they become available. This\nis the most practical step taken so far in the\nrealisation of a National College of Technology.\nIt is reported that the Albert Hall is to be\nconverted into a Tan de Graaf generator.\n! UNION MEETING At the I.C. Extraordinary Union meeting held on\nJanuary 30th. J. UoKenna was elected as Guild*\nrepresentative on the Onion Council, succeeding\nS.H.

At\nthe meeting the President mentioned the statement mad t in the Commons and gave the good news that work is to\nbegin this summer on extending the Union Building.\nTwo new storeys are to be added; the plan* include\na new Gym and changing rooms, Concert Hall, Snaek Bar\nand a Bar extension. It is also hoped that in or eased Hostel space will cater for at least twice a* many\nresidents.\nThe President also gave news or Uoronatlon year\nplans. . His attempt to secure a plot for the Union\non the route had failed as only school children and\ndisabled servicemen can make mass bookings. The\nPresident suggested, however, \"that it might be\npossible to unofficially \"book\" a spot by having\nthirty or forty Union members planted there for several days before the Coronation. It is planned\nto hold a Gala I.C. Sports Day during Coronation week\nwith a dance at the Union in the evening. The\nPresident asked for volunteers to help organise aU.L. U.

They were presented round\nabout 1920 by Ewan Tulloch, who was at the\" R. S.H.19061909 and who won the D.3.0. and V..G. in the Great Wr. The\nheads were shot in Africa, arid represented a complete cross\nsection of the African Antelope. Several of them were\nrecord specimens as Mr. Tulloch only hunted for the not,\nand chose exceptionally fine or alternatively, decrepit\nanimals. They are mentioned in Rowland Ward's book on the\nsubject. Mr, Tulloch rose to be President,, the Chamber of\nMines of Rhodesia, and became very widely known in gold\nmining circles. He died at the end of last year in Bulowayo.\nThe collection 'was valuable, and - t one time extended\ninto the Old Lounge, as well as the Dining Hall.

    "content": "FELIX\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE EDITORtAJUBRAY CIRCULATION: 1250\n\"A pretty poor show,\" \"a rotten FELTX.\"\nComments like these floated round our ears when\nthe last issue appeared. We are to blame, of course. That you, the Union, did practically nothing worth recording; that you wrote practically nothing worth printing; that you presumably thought nothing worth writing; all these are minor points compared with our dreadful error in producing a FELIX which was much worse than its predecessor. But while you grumbled, even then you did not bother to pick, up a pen and say,\" I think this article is stupid. Why not....?\" We can\nonly suppose that you are far busier than is good for you, or that you are scientists of the type so caustically caricatured by Sir Bruce White on\nCommemoration Day, \"1950. ( \" Scientists should be\non tap, not on top\") .\nFELIX is the pulse of student opinion. We\nwould li^e to print your views,, and you ought to be able to read others. As it is, the only views you ever read are those of the FELIX Board, together with a handful of outside stalwarts; because these are the only people who ever write for FELIX. In the last issue, we asked for opinions on\nthe General Studies lectures. Four people replied. Yet when we sent interviewers round the College to gst your reactions at firsthand, many people were only too eager to help us, and\nwe hope that useful conclusions may be drawn from our results. We found that you knew your own\nminds. But had we worked only with the written answers we received, we would only have been able to conclude that you did not care a damn about the lectures; that the time and money spent on them\nwere immaterial to you; that you had no - opinion about College hours undergoing a revolutionary change: in brief, that you were at best a servile band of technology slaves. Trie decline of the power to write, among\nscientists, is a grave ill. The profession Was\nnever noted for its orators; thus literature is its best way of self expression. How, when the scientist is of more importance to the world than ever before, he is becoming inarticulate, apart from the limited perfection which he can achieve in specialist technical papers and reports. The\nreasoning voice of the scientist, the man who\nKnows, is seldom heard in the clatter and babel of political fury which sweeps over the world. In I.C. it is different. The Authorities, if they are wise, pay attention to the will of the students. The Will of the Students could he expressed' through FELIX. That is why it exists. If you pay your three pence every fortnight, that helps to keep FELIX independent. We are not sub sidi sed, and we are not obliged to print anything we do not want to print. Neither are we subject to censorship. But these advantages, which your three pence manages to hold secure, are not much use if you do not supply us with something to proclaim our independence and YODRS.\nImportant news comes rarely; and we fill a good deal of our space with features, some useful, some faintly humorous.. Here, we relay on you\nentirely. In such ventures as \" Eating Around I.C.,\" you can be of immense assistance to us, in helping to compile reliable catalogues of good\nlocal facilities. If the material is there, we will present it. If the enthusiasm is there, we will reflect and amplify it. if apathy is there, we can only weep.\nThe FELIX. General Studies Survey is still in progress, and further replies are needed. We hope\nto interview students in the Union, but written opinions are. still wanted, especially, concerning possible improvements in the Lectures. Editorial Staff of Felix Sports Editors J.

C.At one time or another you must have realised that food is one of the prime necessities of life. That august body, W.H.O., which looks after the world's stomach or rather looks at it has\npublished a list of the exact milligrams and I. Us\nof various foods that suffice an \" average\" human.\nIn that respect, the Union refectory and \" Queen ies are all right, but we believe that I.C. likes an\noccasional meal that satisfies both body and soul, without offending the purse. This series hopes\nto be a pointer to that end.\nDino's, Snack bar and Restaurant, on the outside of the S th. Ken. station arcade, is as\npleasant from the inside as from the outside.( You can't miss the big green and red neon sign) It offers very good food at moderate prices. There is rarely any rush, so the service is quick, and even when it isn't, the waite eem s pleasant. The South Kensington Res aur antin the tube station is a good alternative if the queue at, Lyon's is too long. Its food is about as good, the prices a penny or so higher. One of its j Special it ics is an Anglicised version of spaghetti. It's patronised by the R.C.M. to an appreciable extent. On entering the V..&A. by its side door, signs lead you straight to its restaurant. It's best to follow the signs, as otherwise one is li abl to get inextricably involved in Chinese pottery and\n.old watercolours. The restaurant is by contrast a very bare, high ceiling ed room that makes no\nclaims to any ' atmosphere'. The. food is good, and\nthere is never a crowd - often there is more staff than customers. You may try and strengthen your cultural backlog by lingering on the way out. The 'Hoop and Toy' is a pub which serves luncheons as aside business. It's a quiet place i at lunchtime: situated round the corner from Lyon's at S. Ken.\nIncidentally, the Lyons at Gloucester Road is about as far from the Union as the S th. Ken. one,\nbut not so large and not so crowded.
