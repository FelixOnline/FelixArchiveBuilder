Write to us.\nclubsandsocs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nClubs & Socs Editor - Alice Rowlands\nT\nhe Four Inns Challenge\nis an extreme hiking and\norienteering challenge\nrun in the Peak District by\nthe Scout Association and\nthis year Imperial was represented by,\nnot one, but three brave teams from\nthe Fellwanderers. The challenge entails walking (or running) 45 miles (72\nkm) in a team of three or four across\nsome of the toughest moorland in the\nPeak District, in a race that is almost\ndouble the length of a marathon!\nThe brave competitors were split into\ntwo teams of four and a team of three\nand set off (minus Jim and Ed) from\nthe Union on Friday 4th April. Our\nfirst stop was Derby, where we met Jim\nand Ed and Jim\u2019s mum prepared us an\nepic feast to fuel us through the challenge ahead! After hungrily demolishing the pasta under the guise of \u201ccarbloading\u201d we drove to the start line\n\u2013 Holmbridge.\nHolmbridge village hall, our glamourous accommodation for Friday\nnight, was situated behind a slightly\ncreepy graveyard. There was a definite\nfeeling of apprehension in the\ngroup as we realised it\nwas now impossible to back out of this crazy adventure \u2013 helped by Jim, who had done\nthe challenge once before, making remarks such as \u201cit\u2019s such a long way\u201d\nand \u201cit hurts so much!\u201d Many of the\nother competitors were already asleep\nand as I looked around I couldn\u2019t help\nnoticing that a large proportion of\nthem seemed to be over-developed\nmen clearly too muscular to properly\nfit inside a sleeping bag! The feeling of\napprehension deepened somewhat as\nI noticed the female count was significantly lower than the often-lamented\nImperial ratio.\nThe night was not a peaceful one,\nthe snoring reached truly thunderous\nintensities and at times certain perpetrators seemed to synchronise, raising\nsuspicions that it was actually deliberate and an attempt at sabotage... Thus,\nwe were not as well rested as we may\nhave been when we were awoken for\nbreakfast at 4am. For those of us who\nhadn\u2019t really managed to sleep\nthis came as less of a\nblow than\nmight be expected, but not everyone\nwas in the best of spirits until their bacon sandwiches had been consumed.\nBy this point excitement had set in and\nwe were all eagerly anticipating our\n6:20 start. However, before this we all\nhad to pass the equipment check and\nfor Ande who had already managed\nto lose \u2013 he may prefer mislay \u2013 three\nobjects that morning this was going to\nbe a challenge in itself! In the end (with\nsome sleight of hand involving torches\nand Jim getting various items of clothing confused) my team managed to\npass and we left the safety of the hut at\n6:22, hoping for a time of 17 hours.\nAll three Fellwanderers teams started within minutes of each other but we\nchose diverging routes at the beginning\nand by the top of the first hill we had\nlost the C team. However, at the first\ncheck-point Fell- wanderers B had\ncaught up Fellwanderers\nA by forgoing\nwaterproofs in\nthe wind and\nrain \u2013 assuming optimistically that it\nwould get\nsunny later\nand that\nwe\u2019d walk\nso fast we\nwouldn\u2019t\nget cold.\nFellwanderers team A was led by Nathaniel, this year\u2019s President, and his team\nwere determined to beat Fellwanderers\nB, led by Jim the only Fellwanderer to\nhave attempted this challenge before.\nWe, of course, had other plans...\nThere was a general sense of fun and\nfrivolity in the air as teams A and B\nmade their way through the first four\ncheckpoints together. However, at the\nfourth checkpoint Team B made our\nmove. Instead of allowing time to recuperate and have a hot chocolate we\ndecided to immediately push on leaving Team A behind. From this point\nthe going became a lot tougher. As\nwe rounded Torside reservoir and our\nroute became clear, I had a sinking\nfeeling \u2013 observing the huge mountain\nahead. It seemed interminable and the\nterrain can only described as \u201cbog\u201d.\nAlso, despite having veteran Jim there\nwere moments of doubt as to whether\nor not we were even heading in the\nright direction! We saw many other\nteams branching off to the right but\nstuck to our path and were finally rewarded with a view of the road down to\nour lunch checkpoint \u2013 where before I\ncould eat I had to have water poured\nall over my hands to wash them, having been forced to re-tie my bog-in-fested boot laces mid-way across the\nmountain.\nBy this point the paranoia which was\nto propel Fellwanderers B through the\nrest of the course had begun\n18 felix Friday 8 May 2009\nclubsandsocs.felix@imperial.ac.uk Clubs and Societies\nFearless Fellwanderers\nfinish Four Inns challenge\nHeather Jones reports on the challenges the Fellwanderers underwent on the gruelling and exhausting\nFour Inns Challenge in the Peak District\nto set in. Ande and I were so determined to beat Fellwanderers A that we\nwere unable to relax at the checkpoints\nand after a 30 second stop would begin\nto feel an irrational anxiety that they\nwere just behind us and if we were to\nwait any longer they would catch us\nup! Thus after reading the board of arrivals to check they hadn\u2019t arrived yet\nand wolfing down a few sandwiches\nand plenty of Haribo we were ready to\ngo again.\nThe next checkpoint was directly\nbelow the tallest peak in the Peak District, Kinder Scout, which lay directly\non our path. I named it my personal\nEverest and removed one of my layers\nin anticipation of the effort involved in\nscaling it. Jim had perhaps overdone\nthe motivational horror stories and we\nwere almost convinced that ice axes\nwould be needed and we should not all\nexpect to survive... In the end it turned\nout to be less fearsome than the previous slog across the moors but as Jim\nand Joe waited for Ande and I to reach\nthe top of the hill (again) we were still\npreoccupied with Fellwanderers A...\nwas that them we could see at the bottom of the hill? What about the team\nat the checkpoint? Why had we not\nbrought binoculars??? Being unable to\ndistinguish which team they were, we\nrushed on from the summit of Kinder\nScout with only a passing glance at the\nview \u2013 determined not to be caught up!\nOn the top of Kinder Scout I was\nmerrily negotiating bogs when the result of a slight misjudgement (jumping\ninto one) almost ended in my being\nconsumed! I went in so deep that Ande\nhad to abandon his poles to grab my\narms and pull. We were lucky \u2013 I kept\nboth boots! The descent from Kinder\nScout was definitely the steepest gradient we encountered that day and we\nheard later than someone had been\nhospitalised due an ankle injury incurred whilst descending. Those of us\nwith delicate knees (Ande and I) found\nit both extremely challenging and excruciatingly painful in equal measure\nand it was decided that overmedication\nwith Ibuprofen was necessary! Much\nto the team\u2019s consternation Jim promised to meet us at the next checkpoint\nand practically bounced down the\nhill, disappearing into the distance as\nwe gingerly lowered ourselves down...\nWhen we arrived at the checkpoint,\nexpecting a Jim with a hot chocolate\nand a smile, there was no sign of him...\nSlightly miffed we went about arranging our now indispensable checkpoint\nnecessities, fistfuls of Haribo and Hobnobs dipped in milk.\nWhen Jim turned up we were just\nbeginning to be concerned that he\u2019d\nabandoned us \u2013 and in a fashion he had\n\u2013 whilst we\u2019d been struggling down\nKinder Scout he\u2019d wandered along to\nthe pub and had a \u201ccheeky pint\u201d whilst\nhe was waiting for us! (It\u2019s true \u2013 there\nis photographic evidence) I believe this\nact alone entitles Jim to be christened\nSuavest Fellwanderer 08-09! Whilst\ncasually chatting to the checkpoint ladies they happened to let slip that we\nwere only half way...this was a huge\nblow to morale and both Ande and I\nfound the next hill possibly the most\ndifficult so far. We even debated giving\nup and making the challenge into a pub\ncrawl instead... Ande especially was\nhaving a huge amount of pain from the\nknee he\u2019d so carelessly sprained just a\nfew weeks before the challenge and at\nthat moment the Ibuprofen which had\nsustained us both thus far was failing\nhim.\nJust to help matters, at the top of the\nhill we met three Landrovers \u2013 necessitating us to leave the path to allow\nthem to pass.\nAt this point our team leader felt\nthe time had come for the magical\nsubstance which made all the difference to the rest of the course. Jim had\nmade fudge...and not just any fudge,\nthis fudge was so packed with sugar, so\namazingly sweet that it had 350 calories per square! After just one square\nof this \u201cepic fudge\u201d we were all motivated again which of course had the\ndownside of the return of the Team A\nparanoia... Ande and I had to be convinced that not everyone in light blue\nwas a Wilfred (a Team A member) and\nthat there was no need for a stampede\ndown into Chapel-en-le-Frith \u2013 a brisk\nwalk would suffice.\nHowever, the unceasing paranoia\nwould give us no rest and after I nearly left all of my checkpoint cards in\nChapel-en-le-Frith as we practically\nran out of the checkpoint, once again\nconvinced that Team A were on our\nheels! The walk continued along a railway track carrying perhaps some of the\nslowest trains ever seen... It was half\npast five by the time we ascended our\nsecond last hill, up to the White Hall\ncheckpoint \u2013 all the time watching our\nbacks. We had been walking for over\n11 hours straight and I for one had not\nsat down once! However, by now the\nend seemed near \u2013 there was only one\nmore checkpoint to visit before our final descent into Buxton \u2013 the finish.\nTeam A reached Chapel-en-le-Frith\nlater and were actually both shown\nthe way by a helper and then encouraged by the same man, who\nmet them to check on their\nprogress at the next checkpoint!\nThe final hill was conquered\nwith plenty more assistance\nfrom Jim\u2019s epic fudge \u2013 I consumed two squares at the\nbottom, a quick shot of 700\ncalories of pure sugar and\nfat \u2013 and at ten past seven\nwe arrived at the final\ncheckpoint. However, Team A and\nTeam C, who did not have this magical\nsubstance to pull them through the last\nhurdle and had the increased handicap\nof completing it in the dark have described the guiding wall from the top\nof that hill to the final checkpoint as\nboth \u201cinterminable\u201d and \u201cfrustratingly\nendless\u201d. Happily, from the last checkpoint to the end was only 4 miles and\nby this point finishing within 14 hours\nseemed like an achievable goal for my\nteam \u2013 cutting an amazing 3 hours off\nour original target.\nFinally, the Team A paranoia began to\nsubside, as the end seemed just around\nthe corner. We ended up semi-running\nthe last miles into Buxton along a rough\ntrack whilst singing and humming to\ndistract ourselves from the pain from\nour shredded feet! One should never\nunderestimate the power of \u2018The Final\nCountdown\u2019 as a motivator \u2013 even our\n\u201cacoustic\u201d version! Finally, we reached\nBuxton and to finish we only needed to\nlocate the school. We were so paranoid\nabout getting lost that we\naccosted four\nseparate groups of people to ask them for\ndirections \u2013 including a pair of girls\nwho Ande informed first that their\nschool had closed and then that he\u2019d\n\u201csee them later\u201d. Narrowly escaping police custody for this unusual behaviour\nwe continued towards the school...ac-celerating as the finish approached.\nWe finished the race at a run \u2013 and\narrived at 8:10, just before dark. Immediately upon arrival a wonderful\nlady came and made us all hot chocolate whilst Ande tried to explain to the\norganisers how he\u2019d lost the dog-tag\nhe was under strict instructions not\nto lose! We called Rafal \u2013 an entrant\nfrom the Fellwanderers who had been\nforced not to compete due to injuries \u2013\nwho had been following our progress\nonline. Here he let us know that our\nTeam A paranoia was totally unfound-ed...they had not yet reached the last\ncheckpoint, and as it turns out over\nan hour would pass before they did so!\nThe C team were faring even worse and\nhad only just reached the second last\ncheckpoint. My first mark of celebration was to take off my boots and socks.\nThis revealed the predictably blistered\nfeet that most people suffer after such\nan ordeal and I realised that I\ncouldn\u2019t physically\nput footwear on anymore and wandered off to\nthe shower \u2013 a necessary step before\nthe first aid people would see anyone!\nWe all got cleaned and patched up as\nwell as possible \u2013 in my case involving\na wholly unnecessary sized bandage\nfor a blister that the first aid team were\nforced to syringe. We tried to wait for\nTeam A to finish but eventually succumbed to the temptation of food in-stead! After some of the best \u2013 or at\nleast most welcome \u2013 baked potatoes\never, we returned to the finish where,\nstill, none of our teams had arrived.\nEventually at 11:30 Team A arrived\nwith a time of 17 hours and 10 min-utes. At this point I confess I gave up\nand succumbed to sleep. Despite doing\nour best none of our team managed to\nstay up until 2.04 to welcome the final\nFellwanderers team back.\nA set of cripples left Buxton bound\nfor London on April 6th, but a very\nsatisfied set of cripples, crippled by\nwounded feet and the aching of overused muscles but whom would all\nagree that the satisfaction that comes\nfrom completing the Four Inns Challenge is hard to beat. We all extend our\nsincere thanks to all of the staff manning the checkpoints for their endless\nsupply of Haribo, smiles and general\noptimism that made the pain so much\nmore bearable.

During the three day trip to\nNew York City they won the grand\nprize of $25,000 from J.P. Morgan\u2019s Investment Bank to help fund the work\nthey will be doing in El Salvador this\nyear.\nThe team was competing against six\nother charity groups in the final round\nof J.P. Morgan\u2019s Good Venture Case\nCompetition to secure the sponsor-ship, and came up against representatives of Harvard and Stanford University, among others. The four Civil\nEngineering students impressed the\nboard of judges because of their dedication to and personal involvement\nwith the project endeavour.\nThe charity is an initiative to build\nearthquake resistant houses in poor\nSalvadorian communities during the\nsummer term. From 2001 onwards,\neach year a group of 10-15 students\nhave travelled to relevant parts of El\nSalvador and lived with the community\nmembers, whilst dedicating themselves\nto the construction of safe shelters.\nThe finale of the Good Venture competition was held on 17th April 2009\nat the J.P. Morgan head offices in New\nYork City. The groups presented to a\nhigh-profile judging panel, including\nAlex Lynch, Chairman of North American Mergers & Acquisitions, as well as\nother representatives from across the\nbank.\nTeam members Raz Jabary (1st year),\nFeroza Kassam (1st year), Mohammad\nMahbub (1st year) and Adam Yang\n(2nd year) gave a collective presentation in which they conveyed the message mission of the El Salvador foundation and the reasons why J.P. Morgan\nshould put their mark on their project.\nAfter seven competitive presentations,\nMr. Lynch announced the winners\nfrom Imperial College.\nThis year, a total number of 124\nteams from 74 Universities around the\nworld submitted their cases, of which\nonly 7 made it through to the final\nstage. From these finalists, Imperial\nCollege was the only non-U.S. university to take part in the event.\nOther university finalists, apart\nfrom Harvard and Stanford, were the\nUniversity of Michigan, University\nof Chicago, New York University and\nMount Holyoke College. The donation\nprize will go to this year\u2019s summer involvement and should be adequate to\nfinance the construction of a school as\npart of the team\u2019s widened activities.\nMohammed Belal, team leader of the\n2009 Project, remarks to felix with sat-isfaction: \u201cWe put together an excellent\nteam with great characteristics. The\nevent could not have been any better\u201d.\nAs for the future of the project and\nhow the prize money could have an\nImperial students\nwin $25,000 grand\nprize in New York\nimpact, Mr. Belal said, \u201cWe now have\nthe opportunity to expand our project\nperhaps to different countries. We may\nstart thinking about increasing our\ninvolvement by sending two teams to\nEl Salvador on an annual basis as opposed to one\u2019.\nThe team would particularly like to\nthank Alison Ahearn, who was very\nsupportive in providing information as\nto how best present their case.\nThis year\u2019s project will be concentrated on the town of Collima, situated to\nthe north of the capital San Salvador.\nThrough their work, the team aims\nto make an investment into the local health system, education system\nand the environment, all of which are\nkey aspects that define their social\nresponsibility.\nTeam member Raz says, \u201cWe had a\ngreat team with excellent team-work-ing skills. We hope the finance would\nbe put to good use so that poor communities can benefit from this as much\nas possible and I would like to thank all\nfellow members for their passion and\ncommitment to the cause\u201d.\nOn the outlook for this year, team\nmember Feroza comments, \u201cThe\nsponsorship funding from J.P. Morgan allows us to take this project to\nnew heights, surpassing all our initial\nexpectations. The provision of education for the community of Collima is\nnot something we ever thought our\nfinancial remit could encompass, but\nit brings a fantastic sense of completeness to the project\u201d.\nDuring the summer term, the team\nmembers will spend six weeks among\nCollima\u2019s local community, whilst helping with the design and construction of\nseismically resistant structures, which\ninclude essential houses and retaining\nwalls. So be sure to watch this space for\nmore details on how the group got on\nin El Salvador!\nEngineers\ntravel to\nAntarctica\nTwo students from the Faculty of Engineering had an opportunity to take\npart in a trip of a life-time. Many people yearn for the buzz of some of the\nworlds biggest cities, or the cultural\nhistory the oldest civilisations, whilst\nsome just want to enjoy the warmths\nof the Meditteranean and Carribean.\nVery few, however, seek out to go to\none of the remotest and coldest environments in the world, Antartica. Jeffery Marlow and David Whittleson\nwere two such intrepid explorers who\nbraved the cold and the isolation to\nexperience one of the worlds most untouched environments.\nThe expedition gave the students\nthe opportunity to learn from conservationists and climate change experts\nabout the secluded continent, as well\nas giving them a desire to do more to\ncombat climate change. Find out about\ntheir adventure in next week\u2019s issue of\nfelix.\nNew Mace unveiled\nto celebrate Imperial\u2019s\nindependence\nStudents fined for parking\ntheir bike outside Blackett\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nStudents cycling into College on\nWednesday morning incurred the\nwrath of the Metropolitan Police\nForce, as they attempted to park their\nbikes into the numerous cycle racks\noutside Blackett Laboratory (Physics\nDepartment).\nAs students were trying to park their\nbikes, several members of the Met\nwere waiting to issue on the spot \u00a330\nfines because they were cycling on the\npavement. In order to get to the bike\nracks, students must leave the main\nroad, go over a two metre stretch of\npavement and then descend into the\nbike parking area. Cycling on pavements is considered to be illegal by\nthe Met Police, however, since there is\na small ramp that allows the bikes to\nget onto the pavement from the main\nroad, it has led many students to believe that it would be acceptable for\nthem to mount the pavement. There is\neven a small yellow line in front of the\nramp preventing any cars from parking\nthere and since there is no pedestrian\ncrossing opposite the ramp, it is not\nhard to see why cyclists would assume\nsuch a thing.\nThe police were there for most of the\nmorning and were even approached by\nangry students who were protesting\nthe tactics employed by the Met Police.\nOne such student, Dominic Galliano,\ntold felix that \u201cI do not object to being\nfined, after all I was doing something\nwrong. However, what I do object to is\nthe way the Met Police went about the\noperation.\u201d\nMr Galliano went on to say that \u201cthe\ncynic in me would think this is just\na money making exercise (after all I\nreckon in a few hours they could have\neasily got about 30 students, so about\n\u00a3900) but apart from that it is not the\nway to raise awareness!\u201d\nOthers, however, argue that this was\npurely a money raising exercise. One\nthird year Chemistry student wondered \u201cwhy the police were wasting so\nmuch time fining students for cycling\non a two metre stretch of pavement?\nDid they have nothing better to do that\nday?\u201d\nThe problem here is two-fold: is fining students for cycling on a two metre stretch of pavement really a good\nmethod to raise awareness about the\nillegality of the situation? Alternatively,\nwhich a larger percentage of the student body believes in, was this just a\nmoney raising exercise?\nInspector Nick Cornish from the\nKnightsbridge and Belgravia Police\nDepartment, informed felix that \u201c[we]\nreceived some complaints about cycling on the footpath and clearly some\nproactive police/PCSO actions were\nneeded. I will speak to the Team Sergeant to ensure that any tickets issued\nare proportionate and fair, with the location and duration of travel taken into\nconsideration.\u201d\nThere do exist several options for the\nlarge number of cyclists that come to\nImperial everyday; the most obvious of\nthese is to get off your bike and push it\nfor those two metres. Alternatively, the\nsmall section of pavement can be made\ninto a cycle lane, thus overcoming the\nillegality of cycling on the pavement.\nAn even more costly approach would\nbe to create a segmented pavement to\navoid any possible collisions with the\npedestrians and the cyclists.\nImperial College President, Jenny\nMorgan, informed felix that \u201cit does\nseem a little ridiculous that students\nhave been fined just for crossing the\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nTaxi firm cons Imperial\nNHS out of \u00a3280,000\nDina Ismail\nNews Correspondent\nA taxi firm managed to swindle\n\u00a3280,000 from Imperial College NHS\ntrust by billing them for thousands of\nphantom trips made by a bogus driver.\nEmployees at Lewis Day Courier gave\ntheir non-existent driver \u2018Stuart Villas\u2019\na fake driver number and set up a computer file to list all the \u201cjourneys\u201d he\nhad made on behalf of Imperial NHS,\neven giving him a false North London\naddress and contact numbers.\nOn average, 20 fake journeys were\nmade per day by Villas in a scam that\nlasted for over 18 months, with some\njourneys costing \u00a3109 a time. On one\nsingle day an astonishing 28 taxi trips\nwere faked, ripping off the NHS to\nthe tune of \u00a3900. In one instance, the\nfake driver ID was used to charge \u00a374\nto take a patient just two miles home.\nHowever, the trip had in fact been cancelled by the hospital hours before because the patient was too ill to travel.\nEmployees at the firm would often\ninvoice trips that had been booked\nthen cancelled or just completely in-vented. With hundreds of journeys\nto pay for each month, NHS staff did\nnot usually check each one individually and often in good faith processed\ninvoices without question. The contractor clearly aware of the gap in the\nchecking system, made the maximum\nuse out of it.\nThe matter only finally came to light\nwhen an anonymous NHS office worker found Stuart Villas\u2019s file. The staff\nmember had never heard of him and\nnoticed that most of his journeys invoiced were for cancellations. The individual contacted a national newspaper to expose the fraud, while the NHS\ncalled in its own investigation team.\nSince the revelations Lewis Day has\nagreed to pay back \u00a3280,000 to Imperial College NHS trust, but despite\nthe scam will continue to work for the\ntrust because it is tied into a five year\ncontract worth \u00a36million a year, the\ncourier\u2019s biggest hospital deal.

The texts\nthat come in each week to the Cat\nPhone are often relatively abusive,\nsometimes funny, and rarely do we\npersonally know who they are target-ing. These texts are the views of the\nstudent body and go into the paper\nunmoderated. They do not represent\nthe thoughts of the paper or any of the\neditors. We do not make any up, and\nall texts received are only edited for\nlength. Even spelling and grammatical\nerrors are retained in order to preserve\nthe authenticity of the message. We do\nthis with the aim to keep the meaning\nof the content original and unchanged.\nThe motto of this paper is \u201ckeep the\ncat free\u201d or in laymans terms, \u201cfreedom\nof speech.\u201d If one thinks back to when\nIC Rugby got reasonably aggravated at\na particular text, you can see to take\numbrage is not uncommon. Their supporters retorted to the unknown texter\nthrough where? The text section. It\u2019s\nclear to see that if you have a grievance you should be doing three things.\nFirstly realising that someone out there\nis pissed the fuck off with you and felt\nthat the best way to insult you was\n(admittedly cowardly) though the pa-per. Secondly you need to realise that\none of the best things about this paper\nis the fact that we are not tied down\nby a man in a suit telling us what we\ncan and cannot print. Lastly you have\nto realise that the purpose of the text\nsection is not to single out individuals,\nthen splash their name over 5000 copies of felix. The text section has been\npart of the paper for a number of years,\nyet only this year has the number actually been accessible. We apologise\nif anyone has text us in the past, but\nyou were in fact texting an ex-editor\u2019s\nmother. I am sure she appreciated your\nsnippets on the concept of student life.\nWe decided this year that the \u2018in-jokey\u2019 nature of the Coffee Break section\nneeded to be lost, and opening up the\ntexts to students was one of the steps\nwe took towards achieving our goal.\nI am unwilling to change the editing\nstyle of the texts, as who am I to decide\nsomeone\u2019s personal view is irrelevant?\nI will however take more consideration\nwhen choosing which texts to use. We\nare lucky enough to live in a free country where we don\u2019t have to conform to\npredetermined ideals. This is what felix believes in and how it will remain.\nIf you want to read something that\u2019s\namiable I suggest \u201cThe Very Hungry\nCaterpillar\u201d.

At the age of 16, he was\narrested for theft and served 3 years\nin prison. In 1988, Brown was arrested following an alleged high-speed\ncar chase on Interstate 20 along the\nGeorgia-South Carolina state border.\nHe was convicted of carrying an unlicensed pistol and assaulting a police\nofficer, along with various drug-related\nand driving offences.

Two contrasting teams were faced\nover the matches and general consensus was that Imperial should have got\nmore runs than the 289 scored against\nLondon Met. The top scorer for IC was\nour own El Presidente Ali Najefi who\ngot a very stylish 65 backed up by Big\nBad Zeeshan Malik with 39. In reply,\nLondon Met never really looked like\ngetting the score because of losing\nregular wickets - Viran Parmar ripping through the top and middle order\nwith 6 wickets. The opposition didn\u2019t\nexactly play very fairly and because of\ntheir slow over rate and the setting sun,\nstarted to waste more time while batting to eventually try and come off for\nbad light so that they could try and salvage some points. A London Met bats-man, who straight after middling a ball\nto extra-cover proceeded to complain\nto his mate/umpire that he couldn\u2019t see\nthe ball. The players were soon off for\nlight but justice was done as IC were\nawarded full points.\nSussex were the opposite end of the\nspectrum, and even though we lost to\nthem, it was an honest, hard game of\ncricket with both teams fighting and\nscrapping for victory. They were such\ngood guys that our wicket-keeper for\nthe day Andy Payne - who did a stellar job behind the stumps despite not\nbeing a regular keeper - wound up getting a Sussex batsman\u2019s phone number.\nIC batted first again, and got a decent\nstart with Matt Tarr top-scoring with\n33. People got starts but never really\nkicked on until Daniel Johnpillai and\nRajiv Shah dug in for a partnership at\nthe death, both of whom were executing the now legendary ICLC (Impe-rial College Late Cut) to perfection.\nImperial bowled well, and fought for\neverything, with Ankit Patel getting\n3 wickets and Ahsaan Ismail showing\nsome real fire getting 4 wickets on his\nfirst match on English soil. Eventually\nhowever, the 163 scored by Imperial\nturned out to not be enough as Sussex\ngot it with 2 wickets to spare and about\n6 overs remaining.\nA note of warning that Imperial\u2019s\nfieldinghasnotquitebeenuptoscratch\nas there have been several chances that\nshould have been taken in the first 2\ngames. Mr Jacob Chacko, standing at\nslip due to a hamstring injury, wound\nup letting a ball hit his foot after a batsman had edged it. He then proceeded\nto say something along the lines of\n\u201cwhy didn\u2019t I just put my hand there?\u201d\nand \u201cif I put my hand there I would\nhave caught that\u201d. Mr Chacko then had\nto call on a substitute fielder because\nhe couldn\u2019t field in the deep, put on an\nolympic sprint to the boundary so that\nPete Swallow could come on and then\nhelped himself to some biscuits on the\nboundary - job well done Jacob.\nAs for the freshers playing this year,\nit\u2019s fantastic to see people stepping up\nand making the old-guard fight for\nplaces. People like Imran Zahid, Ahsaan Ismail, Matthew Tarr and Navin\nSurtani have trained hard over the\nwinter and are making good contributions to 1st XI Cricket.\nOn a lighter note, rumours around\nthe club are that Matt Tarr has swine\nflu. If you know the man, find out if\nthis is true or not - but take caution.\nThe worst sledge of the week goes to\nAnkit Patel. After a batsman was out\nLBW, Ankit is quoted \u201cThat was more\nplumb than the fruit from the tree\u201d.\nFines are common in the cricket club\nand leading by example is Ali Najefi\nwho stalled the minibus in Hove and\nblocked traffic while doing a 3-point\nturn at Hove cemetery.\nNavin Surtani\nImperial\nrugby win\nMiddlesex\nsevens\nJames Pettit\nImperial College once again proved\nthat they are probably the best sevens\nteam in the world. Having won the\nMiddlesex Sevens tournament in 2008,\nI.C.U.R.F.C. set out to defend their ti-tle. Eleven rugby players, one frog, the\nChalkes, the Browns, Chilli, two Tim\nBurr\u2019s and a Brime time with Grand\nChildren, arrived at Richmond to begin the long day.\nThe first game was played against\nold rivals Brunel, formally a well recognised rugby college but as of late have\nhad a poor run of form and were looking for a return to greatness. It was not\nlong, however, until the incredible Imperial defence secured a turn over that\nresulted in possession for the majority\nof the match. This resulted in tries from\nJoesph Brown, two from Tom Carroll\nand two from Freddie Chalke giving a\nfinal score of 29-12 to Imperial.\nThe second fixture for the Imperial boys was against Suffolk University. Having brought such a large squad\nwith them, Imperial were able to use\nthe full depth of talent that they had at\ntheir disposal. What happened in that\nmatch can only be described as sheer\ndominance with the Imperial players\ncrossing the try line a total of eight\ntimes. Two each from Max Joachim\nand Tom Carroll, and one each from\nHugh Jarman, Coalan Cotter and Louie\nBarnett saw a final score of 50-0 in only\n14 minutes of rugby. It was clear we\nImperial\u2019s cricketers on fine form at their match against London MET\n\n"

    "content": "10 felix Friday 8 May 2009\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScience\nI was surprised when my office mate\nshowed me a scientific paper signed\nby 3099 co-authors. To run my finger\ndown the list of names was like browsing the index page of a world atlas.\nFrom Armenia to Uzbekistan, almost\nevery country I could remember was\nlisted there. This recent publication is\na newborn from what promises to be a\nvery fruitful parent: the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN),\nsimply the largest particle accelerator\never built.\nIts inauguration was followed by a\nbig stir in the popular media. Some imagined that the LHC would cause the\nend of the world, supposedly draining\nall matter and energy into a black-hole\ncentred in Geneva; while for others it\npromised to reveal the very beginnings\noftheuniverse,disclosing the password\nfor the sacred source of existence. Suddenly humans had built by their own\nhands the key to unlock the Genesis\nor trigger the Apocalypse. However,\nin the real world between the two extremes of history, outside tabloids and\nnovels, we \ufb01nd a determined group of\nscientists very keen to lead us on another step towards understanding the\nfabric of the universe.\nObviously the LHC was established\nwith a clear scientific agenda: experimental and theoretical physicists join-What might we learn from the Large Hadron\nCollider project?\nJudge: Prof. Tejinder Virdee, CERN\nGustavo Assi\n2009 Runner-up\ning forces to validate models in order\nto expand our comprehension of particle physics. More than one hundred\nnations spent precious resources to\nbuild \u201cprobably the biggest and most\ncomplex scientific enterprise ever undertaken by humanity\u201d, designed to\nfind the most fundamental building\nblock we can conceive in our minds\nand make sense of in our theories. Like\na snow leopard being photographed\nin the wild, a multitude of tiny particles that we have never seen - but are\nquite sure they exist - are posing to be\nframed by the talented and meticulous\ncrew at CERN.\nTogether with these scientists, I believe the LHC will bring a new wave of\nscientific knowledge about the natural world never experienced before.\nEventually, as a consequence, we might\nmake sense of another small fraction of\na second after the Big Bang or simply\nproduce a fast grid of supercomputers;\nwe might indulge ourselves in eleven\ndimensions or perhaps even \ufb01nd the\nfamous missing boson. But even if the\nLHC does not produce the expected\n\ufb01nal answers to our current theories,\nthe endeavour will still have fulfilled\nanother goal: to help formulate better\nquestions in our infinite journey of understanding the natural world.\nIn addition to all the scientific breakthroughs that should appear sooner\nor later, we are already harvesting significant lessons from the LHC project.\nWe learn that there is no limit to our\nrunner-up\nunderstanding of the physical world.\n\u201cThe deeper we seek, the more is our\nwonder excited\u201d. This Hadron collider is another step towards what we\nbelieve to be elementary, until we discover that there still is something more\nfundamental behind it. In this world\nof wonderful questing for knowledge\n\u201cthere is not one blade of grass; there is\nno colour\u201d - and there is no elementary\nparticle - \u201cthat is not intended to make\nus rejoice\u201d.\nBut we also learn that the most efficient (and probably most enjoyable)\nway to pursue this satisfying journey\nof discovery is by means of true coop-eration. Whether or not it leads to the\nultimate Uni\ufb01ed Theory, the LHC has\nalready proved itself a major unifying\nendeavour, helping us to taste scientific\nunity in a context of astonishing social\ndiversity. That thousand-author paper\nis one of the first fruits of a venture\nthat gives birth to a new era of peaceful cooperation in science. Those first\n23 pages, listing authors from the 177\ninstitutions involved, are as impressive\nas the content on the remaining 293\npages. We celebrate scientific collaboration at a level never seen before.\nIn summary, there is another side of\nthe LHC that goes beyond matter and\nenergy. This multicultural enterprise is\nalready shining a beam out of the material world into the realm of thoughts\nand ideas. From physics to metaphys-ics, there is much more involved in this\nHadron collider than the clash of tiny\nwild particles. Thousands of scientists\nwith hundreds of different worldviews\nare faced with questions about our own\nnature even before one single particle\nhas been released.\nIn the midst of this diverse universe\nof intangible particles we are eager to\ncombine an ordered cosmos with an\ninquisitive human mind gifted with\ncomprehension.\nHow wonderful it is that we are doing all this together. Let the family be\nfruitful!\nHydrogen is the simplest and most\nabundant element in the universe.\nIt can be produced from a variety of\nsources and has great potential as an\nenergy carrier. As a result it will be key\nin tackling the world\u2019s increasing demand for energy.\nCurrently the development of hydrogen has been mainly restricted to\nthe car manufacturing sector in order\nto find a replacement for the internal\ncombustion engine. Fuel cells have\nbeen developed, which produce electricity to provide power from the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen in the\npresence of an electrolyte. No waste\nproduct other than water is produced.\nWhen hydrogen fuel cells are used,\nthey have several advantages: they\nare mechanically and hydraulically\nvery simple, they are quiet, cheap to\nmaintain, allow rapid acceleration and\nare more compact than combustion\nengines, giving the car manufacturer\nmore freedom especially in terms of\ndesign. Finally they can even provide a\nmobile source of energy at peak times\nfor domestic use, when the unit cost\nis high or in remote areas, since they\nrun on cheap fuel and are more efficient than combustion engines. Apart\nfrom in vehicles, they can also be used\nin aeroplanes, ships and trains. In\nApril 2008, Boeing announced that it\nhad successfully completed \ufb02ights of a\nsmall propeller aeroplane powered by\nhydrogen fuel cells.\nHydrogen could also revolutionise\nthe domestic renewable energy sector.\nHouses with their own wind turbines\nor solar cells could use excess electricity to electrolyse water to produce hydrogen which can then be stored. As\nopposed to lead-acid batteries, energy\ncan be stored for long periods of time\nand performance does not degrade.\nElectricity generated in the summer\ncan be stored for the winter for exam-ple. When necessary, stored hydrogen\ncan be used to power fuel cells. At the\nmoment it is very expensive but with\ngreater development and demand in\nthe future, prices should fall rapidly. In\ncountries such as South Korea where\nthe main cooking and heating fuel is\nmethane, supplied in pressurised bot-tles, it may be possible to replace these\nwith hydrogen.\nAt the moment there are a few technical constraints. Storage can be a\nproblem since hydrogen either has\nto be cooled to a liquid or stored under pressure. With both methods, the\ntechniques require further improvement and they still remain relatively\nexpensive. One solution may be to\ncombine hydrogen with another ele-ment, such as lithium to form lithium\nhydride which can easily be stored. The\nreaction can easily be reversed with a\nplatinum catalyst. Another problem\nis the lack of a distribution network\nwhich must be developed, similar to\nthe oil distribution system. This will\nbe expensive and will initially rely on\nthe public sector. A solution may be to\ndevelop the system, first concentrating\non places where there will be a high\ndemand, such as military bases, police\nstations, large factories and hospitals.\nThis would create a basic network of\npipelines which would encourage the\nfirst development of commercial hydrogen stations.\nThe environmental implications of\nan economy based on hydrogen and\nelectricity as energy carriers could potentially be very positive, provided that\nthe electricity comes from renewable\nresources or potentially from nuclear\nfission or fusion. Until this is possible,\nfossil fuels could still be used to produce electricity and hydrogen since\nthe carbon dioxide released could be\nsequestered. In the long term it is vital\nthat all hydrogen is produced by splitting water using electricity since this\nwill ensure that it is sustainable, as this\nis what the hydrogen returns to when\nburnt.\nIn the coming years political will to\ndevelop a \u201chydrogen economy\u201d will\nbe vital to ensure continued research\nand development in this area, to create more efficient fuel cells and design effective distribution and storage\nsystems. Stimulus packages, subsidies\nand grants will also be essential to encourage public uptake of the new tech-nologies. I believe many countries will\nensure this happens since for them it\nensures energy independence from oil\nproducing countries, many of which\nare politically sensitive. Also the increasing international emphasis on the\nneed to combat climate change should\nalso en- courage political leaders to invest in hydrogen technologies. So far\nHydrogen is key to tackling the world\u2019s rapid ly increasing demand\nfor energy.

With the election of Barack\nObama it is likely that over the next\nfew years significant development will\ntake place in the USA. The European\nCommission also organised the European Technology Platform for Hydrogen at which over 300 representatives\nfrom interest groups took part.\nAs with all new technologies it will\ntake several decades for hydrogen\nto become a primary energy carrier.\nContrary to popular belief it will not\nhappen overnight, it will be a long\nmarathon.\nA Hydrogen Mini\n11\nFriday 8 May 2009 felix\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPolitics\nPolitics Editors \u2013 James Goldsack & Katya-yani Vyas\nOver the early weeks of April, China\nand Russia refused to recognize a\nNorth Korean ballistic missile test as a\nNorth Korean ballistic missile test, essentially blocking a strong UN Security\nCouncil Resolution that would have\nsubjected the hermit regime to harsh\nsanctions.\nFor the two countries, China espe-cially, this follows a long-running trend\nof supporting, explicitly or implicitly,\nregimes widely considered controversial or even evil. From backing the\ngenocidal Khmer Rouge during the\n1970s to arming and funding Robert\nMugabe\u2019s ZANU-PF, the murderous\nregime in the Sudan and the military\njunta in Myanmar, China has shown a\nwillingness to brush aside petty considerations such as respect for human life in its world-wide search for\nfriendship.\nOne explanation for this readiness\nto seek friends unpopular in the playground of international relations is the\nChinese perception of insecurity.\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet\nbloc, Chinese communist leaders are\nkeenly aware of the threats to their\ndominance, the most prominent being the potential consequences of an\nincrease in unemployment, damaging\nsocial stability and potentially uniting\ndisparate antagonistic groups under\nthe banner of nationalism: patriotic\nstudents, laid-off workers, discontented middle classes.\nGiven the scale of their financial re-serves, the Chinese government feels\nrelatively well-placed to ride this year\u2019s\nfinancial turbulence out. After all, they\ndo not have to deal with public opinion furious at the scale of debt required\nby Keynesian economics that Western\ngovernments are experiencing.\nOf greater concern to their long-term view is \u2018energy security\u2019. The Chinese economy is heavily dependent\non oil purchased on the international\noil market, making them vulnerable\nto price spikes. Their demand is ever-growing with changing patterns of\nconsumer consumption. They con-China and the international pariahs\nDom Maciver\nsider themselves to be more vulnerable\nto fluctuating prices because of their\ninefficiency in comparison to other oil\nimporters.\nIt is this that propelled them towards\nassociation with Sudan, towards chumminess with Hugo Chavez, towards\nobstructing IMF attempts to improve\ngovernance in Angola, towards a good\nrelationship with Iran (including selling them missile technology, according\nto the US reports) and towards arming\nthe military junta in Myanmar against\ndiscontented Buddhist monks.\nHowever, it should be said that over\nthe course of this decade, China has\nimproved its behaviour in response\nto international criticism. They have\npressured Sudan to accept peacekeeping troops, they have tried to\nforce North Korea to the negotiating\ntable (although appear to be almost\nas baffled as the West by Kim Jong Il\u2019s\nbehaviour), and they have developed a\ngood reputation with governments in\ndeveloping nations worldwide during\nthe Bush years, advancing \u2018soft power\u2019\nthrough generous and respectful diplomacy as America ruined its reputation in Iraq.\nWhy should this matter to us in the\nUK? In part, our prominence in world\naffairs relative to our tiny size relates to\nboth our long history as the first parliamentary regime, and our unique position in between Europe and America.\nWe see both sides of the coin, for example having long supported Turkey\u2019s\nadmission to the EU.\nThis was recently backed by Obama\nas a means to open our doors to the\nMuslim world, but has long been opposed by France and Germany, who\nwould lose their majority within the\nvoting apparatus of the EU. Any decrease in American standing is a decrease in our standing as well.\nTo believe the output of the newspapers and politicians, our own society is fundamentally broken: apathetic,\nalienated and polarized. Twisted and\ndivided by institutional greed, we are\nbeset by police brutality, gang warfare,\nimmoral foreign policy and political\ndecay.\nHowever, the incessant quest for sales\nled by the Sun and the Daily Mail and\nbacked up by the broadsheets does not\nso often notice the strengths of our society from a comparative perspective.\nThe uproar created over Ian Tomlinson\u2019s tragic death has been impressive\nand deserved, and lies in stark contrast\nto the silence in other societies when\nprotesters or dissidents are killed, in\ntheir countries or in others\u2019.\nTo cite extreme examples, last year in\nMyanmar protesters were shot by the\narmy after their attempts to influence\nthe military regime and the monks who\nled the protest were arrested, beaten\nand given absurdly harsh sentences\n(such as 65 to 100 years). The mouthpiece for the Chinese government, the\nPeople\u2019s Daily, in turn condemned foreign media reports that had criticized\nChina for not exerting its influence on\nthe regime, saying they had been motivated by \u201culterior motives\u201d.\nThis is not to argue that we should always self-righteously intervene in other nations\u2019 affairs if we don\u2019t like their\npolicies. China, despite its authoritarian tendencies and occasionally drift\ntoward pariah statehood, has been the\ngreat success story of the 21st century,\nlifting millions out of poverty.\nWe have not been so perfect in our\nchoice of friends internationally: replacing Iran\u2019s democratically elected\nPrime Minister in 1953 with a friendly\nauthoritarian was one example of historical hypocrisy among many. Perhaps we have not put as much pressure\non Israel to dismantle settlements in\nPalestinian lands as we should.\nNonetheless, errors of judgment not-withstanding, we still have morality on\nour side. The poor and displaced of the\nworld dream of coming here, and are\nwelcomed by the vast (sane) majority\nof society if they manage to.\nThe fact that we can replace our government without bloodshed is testament to the strength of the system that\nwe have established, imperfect as it is.\nAs Churchill said, \u201cperfect solutions of\nour difficulties are not to be looked for\nin an imperfect world.\u201d\nInterventions in Kosovo and Sierra Leone and the election of Barack\nObama stand as proof to authoritarians that, as Obama put it, they are on\n\u201cthe wrong side of history\u201d.\nEven in these dark times of economic crisis, inadequate government\nand traumatized society, we must not\nforget that.\nChina\u2019s President Hu Jintao greets US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton whilst on a diplomatic visit\nProtesters in Myanmar were beaten, arrested or shot for attempting to influence the military regime\n\n"

But today the world feels\nlike a better place. The centenary report of the Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change has confirmed what\nfew had dared hope \u2013 the scientific\nconsensus is that the earth\u2019s temperature has finally peaked. This seems like\na good moment to look back and reflect on how we got here.\nJust three-quarters of a century ago\nit seemed we were on the brink of ca-tastrophe. While some were in denial,\na sense of powerlessness in a complex,\nglobalised world led others to turn\ntheir backs on rational solutions to our\nmounting problems. They placed their\nfaith in false prophets. Self-proclaimed\n\u2018experts\u2019, often-charismatic celebrities,\nwho offered solutions based not on\nevidence, but on anecdote and whimsy.\nParadoxically this was a golden age for\nscience, but it was a dark age for our\nculture.\nPerhaps it\u2019s hard to appreciate from\ntoday\u2019s enlightened perspective just\nhow profound a change has occurred.\nSo let me describe the four key pillars\non which I believe this renaissance in\npublic attitudes to science was built.\nThe primary catalyst for change was\neducation. While educators continued\nto teach the methods and facts of science as they always had, they began\nto do something else - they began to\ninspire children. In primary school,\npupils were introduced to the wonders of the natural world, and - with\nthe aid of new teaching technologies\nlike HoloSim - to the amazing story\nof how scientists had begun to reveal\nthe beautiful structures that lie behind\nour seemingly chaotic everyday ex-perience. In secondary school, pupils\nlearned how the scientific method was\ntheir bastion against those who would\nseek, often inadvertently, to undermine their own health, and that of the\nworld in which they lived. They gained\na sense of pride in knowing how not to\nbe hoodwinked. To be ignorant of science was to be diminished as a person.\n75 years ago in politics, success\nwas measured in terms of short-term\npopularity. The political class knew\nscience and technology were fundamental to economic prosperity, but the\nimportance of the scientific method\nto the process of political decision-making had not yet been grasped.\nAfter a decade of economic austerity\nand mounting environmental chaos,\nthe public began to realise that what\nmattered was finding evidence-based\nsolutions to the huge problems we\nfaced. The people demanded their\npoliticians gather evidence, and act on\nWhat can be done to ensure an informed and balanced public and\npolitical debate of Science and Technology? Judge: Dr. Martyn Sen\u00e9,\nwinner\nMatt Silver\n2009 Science Challenge Winner\nScientists clash on the subject of human evolution because evolution\nmeans something slightly different to\neach of them. For Prof Steve Jones,\nwho considers evolution from a gene\nsurvival standpoint, the weakening of\nnatural selective forces due to medical\nadvances and modern technology suggests our species is reaching an evolutionary stagnation point. But although\nour genetic material is almost identical to primates, those who take the\nbroader view that evolution is simply\nchange over time, believe that genome\nmaps point to an evolution explosion.\nPerhaps in the 150 years since Darwin\u2019s revolutionary observations, the\nterm evolution has itself evolved, and\nthe meaning of its descendent, clevolu-tion, will help us answer whether and\nhow Homo sapiens will do the same.\nThis essay explores two analogies that\nunearth the possibilities.\nCoiled Laser Evolution\nWhat does evolution have in com-Will Homo Sapiens continue to evolve? If so, how?\nJudge: Prof. Armand Leroi, Imperial College\nrunner-up\nSang Nguyen\n2009 Runner-up\nAn unseasonal downpour chases a\ngroup of television executives as they\nrun from their 4x4 into the centrally-heated airport. They reach the lounge,\norder cappuccinos, and plug in their\nlaptops. To raucous agreement, one of\nthem exclaims that he\u2019s sick of reading\nprogramme proposals about \u2018\ufb02ipping\nclimate change\u2019. He adds that if he but\nsees the word \u2018environment\u2019 in the subject title of an email, he immediately\nhits the \u2018delete\u2019 button.\nTheir \ufb02ight is called. Packing away\ntheir laptops, they head for the gates.\nWitnessing this scene, I felt it\nsummed up a modern dilemma: our\nvoracious hunger for progress has led\nto a depletion of the energy sources on\nwhich much of that progress depends.\nIn November 2008 the annual report\nof the International Energy Agency\npredicted an increase in global energy\ndemand of 45% by 2030. At the same\ntime, supplies are becoming increasingly uncertain.\nEven without such concerns, the wisdom of our dependency on fossil fuels\nis questionable. Their combustion releases greenhouse gases, causing global\nwarming which could be irreversible.\nThose pesky \u2018unseasonal downpours\u2019\nmay only be the beginning.\nYet our TV executives are unmoved.\nWhile the lights are still on in the Big\nBrother house, it\u2019s business as usual.\nGiven this collective lethargy, it is\nperhaps unsurprising so many are\nunaware there is a type of energy that\ncould break the deadlock. That energy\nis hydrogen.\nHydrogen should need no introduc-tion. After all, it is the most abundant\nelement in the universe. It is not freely\navailable: in order to be used it needs\nto be extracted from other substances\nsuch as water, fossil fuels or biomass.\nStill, that list alone shows just how\nplentiful it is.\nBut then what? In fact, it can be com-busted like a conventional fuel. Then\nthere is the fuel cell.\nA hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical energy conversion device\nthat turns hydrogen and oxygen into\nwater, producing electricity and heat\nalong the way. Water is the only waste\nproduct.\nA simple reaction, you might think -and an emission-free one to boot.\nEven to the most ill-informed TV\nviewer, this must sound good. After\nall, this fuel is NOT going to run out.\nFurthermore, where other fuels are unevenly distributed around the world,\nplaying havoc with global security,\nhydrogen, in its different compound\nHydrogen is key to tackling the world\u2019s\nrapidly increasing demand for energy.\nDiscuss.

All essays and references can be found at www.\nsciencechallenge.org\nit. Of course political disagreements\nremained, as they always will, but political argument had become less about\nrhetoric, more about a rational search\nfor answers.\nAt the turn of the century, the public learned about cutting-edge science\nprimarily through the mass media.\nWith a few exceptions, the reporting\nof science news was woeful. Journalists adept at teasing fact from fiction\nin the difficult terrain of war reporting\nfor example, saw no need to draw the\ndistinction between scientific consensus and maverick opinion in the realm\nof science. Mass print and broadcast\nmedia competed with simplistic, sensationalist headlines produced by non-specialist journalists, often with the\nconnivance of commercial interests, or\neven university PR departments hungry for coverage. The internet changed\neverything. A growing band of web-based science communicators began\nto satisfy a voracious demand for accurate science news, presented with\noriginality and \ufb02air. Most importantly\nthey brought together communities of\npeople who could share, discuss and\nchallenge scienti\ufb01c information in the\npublic domain. Of course one key element in this new community were the\nscientists themselves...\nScience always had its great communicators - men and women who\nrelished the opportunity to explain\ntheir work to the public. They were\nhowever a tiny minority. As science\nembraced its role of tackling the key\ntechnological and intellectual challenges of our age, attracting an ever-increasing proportion of public funds,\nscientists were forced to acknowledge\ntheir public role. A privileged position\nat the nexus of scienti\ufb01c research and\npublic opinion meant that public accountability was a key element in every\nscientist\u2019s job description. Of course\nnot all researchers could be great com-municators, but an element of interaction with the public, whether through\nweb communities, face to face work in\nschools, or work within the media or\npolitics became mandatory. It was only\nthen that science could regain its posi-tion, lost throughout much of the 20th\ncentury, at the heart of popular and intellectual culture.\nWe will never inhabit a trouble-free\nworld. Within a decade of \ufb01nding the\nuniversal cure for cancer new challenges emerged - the devastating epidemic\nof viral replicators from lunar mining\ncolonies and the dreadful consequences of back street cloning to name but\ntwo. While problems remain, we can\ntake comfort from the fact that we will\nface the challenges of the 22nd century\nwith all the tools of human ingenuity at\nour disposal.\nmon with a laser? Evolution is often\nregarded as a continuous progression\ntowards increasing complexity, but it\ndoes not always lead to more complex\norganisms. Veterans of evolution, such\nas bacteria, demonstrate that nature\nalso enjoys the simple life. Similarly, a\nlaser stays focused along its path, and\nalthough it appears as a steady stream,\ndiscrete photons emitted at random\nintervals mimic the unpredictable occurrence of genetic mutations. Though\nrather than viewing evolution as a one-dimensional beam, a better three-di-mensional picture is a coiled laser (see\nabove). Even if the laser coil collapses\ninto a circle, the beam continues. In\nother words, if natural selection becomes obsolete, the other dimensions:\ngenetic drift and gene \ufb02ow, take on\ngreater importance as driving mechanisms of evolution.\nWhat does the coiled laser analogy\nreveal about our evolution? By mastering total internal re\ufb02ection, we use\nfibre optics to guide lasers around ob-stacles, enabling the vast global communication networks we now take for\nforms, is everywhere.\nThere\u2019s more. Hydrogen offers great\npotential for energy storage. In fact, it is\nthe perfect bed-fellow for the discerning renewable. Not much wind today?\nNo worries! Bit cloudy? Not a problem!\nIn the hydrogen-economy, the power\ngenerated when the weather conditions were right can be used to create\nhydrogen. Thus, on a still, sunless day,\nthe stored hydrogen is ready and waiting to step in and \ufb01ll the gap.\nSo - a totally clean, carbon-free route\nto sustainable energy consumption ex-ists? Why aren\u2019t our television screens\nbombarding us with this news?\nIf only it were that simple. For a start,\nwe know hydrogen cannot be used\nwithout being produced \ufb01rst. This requires other energy sources. In current\nhydrogen production, these tend to be\nfossil fuels, as they are the least expen-sive. Consequently, carbon dioxide is\nemitted, contributing to global warm-ing. Unfortunately, as with most of our\nknottiest problems, the politics is as\nimportant as the science. Governments\nare unwilling to invest in infrastructure\nfor technology until they know it has a\nlong-term future. Likewise, businesses\ndon\u2019t want to fund technology until the\ninfrastructure is in place.\nIt\u2019s a \u2018Catch-22\u2019 situation that acts\nas a powerful brake - not only on the\nnetworks needed to make hydrogen\nubiquitous, but also on the research\nand development required to solve\nthe scientific problems that do remain.\nHydrogen is so light, for example, that\nit needs to be compressed enormously\nor liquidfied before being transported\nin useful amounts. Challenging - but\nnot insurmountable, given sufficient\nfinance.\nLuckily, there are glimmers of hope.\nA team of scientists recently placed 27\nhydrogen- powered buses in 9 European cities, and monitored them for 5\nyears. The project ended in 2006. Result? Collectively, the buses traveled\napproximately 258,000km. Infrastructure problems were ironed out - and\nreliability compared favourably to conventional buses.\nThis was a discreet study that arguably didn\u2019t receive the publicity it\ndeserved. Maybe that\u2019s the real mes-sage. Those TV executives - and their\nviewers - may not care what powers\ntheir laptops - but they would be devastated if nothing did. So, they need\nto be made to care. The superstitious\ntraveler suspects it is only passengers\u2019\ncollective belief that keeps his plane in\nthe air. So with the hydrogen economy.\nUntil it has the weight of public opinion behind it, it is going nowhere. We\nneed to believe - and then, just maybe,\nthis bird will fly.\ngranted. Likewise, our evolutionary\npath meanders to overcome challeng-es, and we can direct it by understanding our genome. Now consider a laser\npassing through double slits, which\nsymbolises the simultaneous confrontation of two scenarios: climate led\nevolution whereby humans are forced\nto adapt signi\ufb01cantly to cope with unpredictable environmental variations;\nand customisable lifespan evolution\ndriven by our ability to manipulate\nthe genes responsible for ageing. Ultimately, the laser encounters a distant\nsurface and the resultant interference\nfringe pattern signi\ufb01es the spreading of the human population. Correspondingly, colony leaping evolution\nemerges, as we move from planet to\nplanet to satisfy our spiralling resource\nrequirements. The necessary attribute\nfor a laser to arrive at this destination is\ncoherence. Hence, for humans to survive the twisting tale of clevolution, we\nwill need global co-operation, as well\nas clever solutions.\nCard Lattice Evolution\nAlternatively, the intricacies of clevo-lution may be explained by a game; a\ngame of both choice and chance. This\nmodel suggests that nature plays cards,\nand we are the cards used to construct a\ntriangular tower. The suits correspond\nto the four bases in DNA, while the\nmany permutations of card combinations embody our genome. Just as our\nevolution depends on reproduction via\nmale and female couples, pairs of cards\nleaning against each other establish the\nbuilding blocks of the lattice. The cl\u00e9\nto cl\u00e9volution is diversity, represented\nby each horizontal bridging card that\nforms a foundation for further evo-lution. Mutation is the genetic joker\ncard. The height of the card tower (the\nextent of human evolution) is determined by the number of cards at the\nbase. Indeed, scientists believe that our\nevolution was recently accelerated by\nexponential population growth.\nWhat does the card lattice analogy mean for humanity? If our population stabilizes, we would reach a limit\nfor carbon life-based evolution. This\npopulation plateau may occur if our\nefforts to delay climate led evolution\ninvolve restrictions to energy and food\nsupplies. During this period of consumption limited evolution, we will\nreduce personal travel and increasingly communicate using information\ntechnology.\nThis cyber-linked evolution can be\nvisulised as an extra \u2018base pair\u2019 of cards\nascending aside the original tower, illustrating how silicon-based machines\nwill evolve alongside Homo sapiens.\nInstead of male and female, the codependent card pairs are now processing speed and memory capacity. These\nwill develop at such a rate that artificial\nintelligence is expected to overtake the\nbrain power of humans by about 2050.\nHomo sapiens will finally have a threat\nother than ourselves. However, rather\nthan be replaced by our competitors,\nwe will undergo coalescing life-form\nevolution, as man and machine unite.\nIn this outlook, it is variation not of the\nbody but of the mind that matters. The\nquestion is: will Homo sapiens have the\nintellectual diversity to evolve further?\nAs long as scientists continue to clash,\nthe answer is \u2018yes\u2019.\nThis editors impression of what human clones could look like.\nI, science\nIssue 12 \u2022 Summer 2009 - OUT NEXT WEEK!\nScratch & Sniff front cover!!!\nFocus: green\nenergy\nALSO: Proust Phenomenon, Solar\nCars & London\u2019s Wild Parrots\n\n"

Hangman decided\nto ask her a few questions about her\nlatest humanitarian project, tackling\nthe sometimes dire and frankly dull\natmosphere that can exist at Imperial\nCollege Union.\nHangman\nSo Elle, you have taken on the newly\ncreated role of the Super-Happy-FunTimes Officer at ICU. Are you looking\nforward to working at London\u2019s biggest cock-fest, I mean, most prestigious cock-fest, I mean... Do yourself a\nfavour and just leave, seriously.\nElle\nNo I\u2019m not one to shy away from a\njob, I\u2019m not afraid of a challenge. I\nonce made Dick Cheney smile without waterboarding anyone, I once gave\nthe Pope a boner and three days ago I\nmanaged to turn Gordon Brown into a\ncredible politician, no sorry that\u2019s impossible but still an impressive track\nrecord I think you\u2019ll agree.\nHangman\nRight sure. So what\u2019s the purpose of\nyour job?\nElle\nBasically, I try to get Imperial students laid but as yet I haven\u2019t gotten\nthem past a nervous \u201cHello?\u201d. Also I try\nand get them to actually come to the\nUnion and fill the place up, maybe have\nfun.\nHangman\nSurely that\u2019s an impossible task.\nElle\nIt is, I\u2019m still trying to figure out\nwhat\u2019s holding this place back.\nHangman\nBad music, slow bar staff, rubber\nfood!\nElle\nWhat about them? Recipe for success\nI think. Anyway, I want to see why they\ndon\u2019t like these things. We love them\nin Australia.\nHangman\nYes but you also love racism, douche-bag surfer clothes and kangaroos.\nElle\nOh, I see. Well what if we introduced\ngirls... and a lollipop scrambler.\nHangman\nNo idea what that is but more to the\npoint where are these girls going to\ncome from? Imperial? Other univer-sities? The general surrounding area?\nAre you fucking batshit crazy?!?!?!\nThe new Super-Happy-Fun-Times Officer talks to \u0425\u0430\u043d\u0433\u043c\u0430\u043d\nabout how she plans to improve the Union\nElle\nNo... Actually I have found some, but\nthere\u2019s a small technicality.\nHangman\nWhich is?\nElle\nThey don\u2019t want to come. I\u2019ll have\nto pay them to actually turn up to the\nUnion! Maybe dress them up a little\nbit, probably use some of my Intimates\nRange, you know, kinda have them as\npromo girls. Hot naked, promo girls.\nHangman\nI\u2019m sure Imperial Girls here would\napprove of that.\nElle\nWhat are they?\nHangman\nNot sure. So what are these anonymous hot naked, promo girls going to\ndo.\nElle\nWe\u2019re going to get them to go around\nand talk to the guys, tell them how interesting their subject is and that their\nt-shirts are really \u2018trendy\u2019. You know\nego boosting, completely unjustified\nego boosting.\nHangman\nA bit transparent don\u2019t you think?\nElle\nOf course we won\u2019t tell the male\npopulation that the girls are only talking to them because they\u2019re being paid.\nWhat\u2019s transparent about girls walking\naround the union in underwear complimenting guys? You\u2019re probably wondering where I\u2019m going to get these\ngirls from aren\u2019t you?\nHangman\nNo, not really, I\u2019m just wondering if\nyou have any brain cells.\nElle\nAmerica!\nHangman\nNope no brain cells. What do you\nmean America?\nElle\nYep, Land of the Brave and the Free\nand all of that star spangled stuff. They\nship them over by the brothel load!\nThey\u2019re kept in this shithole called\nRichmond University doing \u2018courses\u2019\nsuch as \u201cTravelology\u201d or something like\nthat. What people don\u2019t actually realise\nis that it\u2019s not really a university...\nHangman\nI think everyone at Imperial realises\nthat\nElle\nNo, no, I mean it\u2019s exists primarily\nto keep the male:female ratio in the\nUnion on Wednesday nights to an acceptable level. If it reaches 101:1 we\u2019re\nlegally obliged to shut down. It\u2019s called\nthe \u201cGet-a-Fucking-Life\u201d Act of 1989.\nHangman\nShouldn\u2019t you be addressing the core\nissue, which is that many Imperial girls\ndon\u2019t come to the Union. How are you\ngoing to persuade them to come to the\nUnion.\nElle\nThere\u2019s really no hope I\u2019m afraid.\nHangman\nNo hope?\nElle\nThis is London. Why would girls with\nany sense want to go to Imperial Union\nwhen there\u2019s a whole city of real people with proper lives out there. Haven\u2019t\nyou heard of clubs?\nHangman\nExcuse me?\nElle\nYou know, underground, loud music,\nimpossible to talk, sweaty, only fun if\nyou\u2019re pilled up?\nHangman\nYou\u2019ve completely lost me. Anyway,\nyou\u2019re saying that Imperial girls won\u2019t\ncome to the Union because there are\nmuch better places to go. Isn\u2019t that\nwhat you\u2019re meant to fix? And why on\nEarth would American girls come if\nImperial girls don\u2019t\nElle\nI\u2019m going to fix it for the guys, then\nmaybe the girls as an after-thought.\nAnd it\u2019s simple, those American girls\nare dumb enough to come here... and\nalso... ahem.... we pay them....\nHangman\nWHAT?!!? So the only reason there\nhave been so many Americans in the\nUnion over the past few years has been\nbecause we\u2019ve paid them to come here.\nWhat about the financial implications\nof this?\nElle\nWhat financial implications?\nHangman\nWhat do you mean, what financial\nimplications?!??! You\u2019re paying people,\nno sorry AMERICAN people, to come\nto the Union, you\u2019re flushing money\ndown the toilet.\nElle\nSorry still not fully understanding the problem here. We always lose\nmoney, I thought that was they way it\nwas meant to be.\nPlus the Americans are the only people who seem to like the music we play\nhere, got to give the people what they\nwant.\nHangman\nSo we\u2019re playing music that people\nwho are only here because we pay them\nto be here like? Even though most Imperial students fucking hate Drum &\nBass. You don\u2019t really know what you\u2019re\ndoing, do you?\nElle\nThat\u2019s not true. I know exactly what\nI\u2019m doing. I\u2019m paying hot girls...\nHangman\nwell...\nElle Macpherson and Hangman pose outside the Albert Hall. You can\u2019t\nsee, but Hangman has a boner... and a gun... You don\u2019t want to know.\nElle\nOk, I\u2019m paying slutty girls to come\nto the Union and interact with the\nmale population here. They\u2019re getting\npaid, the DJ\u2019s get paid and I get paid.\nIt\u2019s a win-win-win combination! That\u2019s\nTHREE wins?\nHangman\nRight, we\u2019re doomed. Well, thanks\nvery much for the interview!\nNext week, I\u2019ll be talking to the new\nhead of food and drink, as well as having a look at a new addition to the\nevening menu in the Union. Sources\ntell us it\u2019s edible...\nWe\u2019ll see.\nWe didn\u2019t actually email Elle for an interview, we just found her under\nthis waterfall. You see, good things come to those who wash :)\n\n"

In fact the winner was Ian\nGilmore who managed to get into the\nmind of our clever cryptic crossword\nsetter and solve his tricksy riddles.\nLet us see how you all cope with this\none and let\u2019s hope that more people\ncan beat the top guns to the punch\nwith the solutions.\nCrossword by: Sam Wong\nAs the name suggest remedial massage\naims to remedy, but you do not need\nto be injured or ill to have a remedial\nmassage; it can be used like a MOT or\nservice for the body.\nPrevention is better than cure! Why\nnot treat that nagging ache before it\nbecomes a repetitive strain injury?\nWhy not address postural imbalances\nand avoid lower back pain or treat your\ncomputer neck before developing tension headaches? Improve sport performance and avoid injuries by treating\ntight muscles. Remedial massage can\nsimply be used to relax and de-stress,\nso if the thought of exams and studying\nis getting to you, take a break.\nA remedial treatment can combine\ndifferent massage styles, advanced\ntechniques, joint mobilisations and\nstretches. For example a person may\nhave tennis elbow, tight hamstrings\nand upper body tension, requiring\nsports therapy, deep tissue and Swedish techniques with exercise and pos-tural advice.\nRemedial massage works by concentrating on specific injuries or imbalances within the body, using soft tissue\nmanipulation to reduce muscle tension\nwhich in turn allows better joint range\nof motion. As a whole improving circu-lation, calming the central nervous sys-tem, boosting the immune system and\nRemedial massage to relieve\nthose aches and pains\nstimulating the release of endorphins,\nthe bodies natural feel good factor.\nA remedial massage works on many\nlevels, creating a calm, balanced sense\nof well being.\nLymphatic Drainage (LD) is a more\nspecific form of massage which uses\nmostly light pressure and gentle, rhythmic strokes to increase and improve\nlymphatic flow and drainage. Lymph\nis an essential part of our immune system and helps fight infection.\nPrimarily used to treat lymphoede-ma or swelling by helping to drain excess fluids from injured or congested\nareas of the body. It can speed up the\nrecovery process after illness or simply\nbe used to help keep the immune system healthy. It improves skin texture\nby reducing swelling, puffiness and\nblotches and can speed up healing in\nscar tissue.\nPhilip studied in Sydney, Australia\nwhere he lived and worked for 5 years.\nHis studies have encompassed many\ndifferent massage styles; remedial,\nsports, deep tissue, Swedish, trigger\npoint, intuitive massage, lymphatic\ndrainage, Chinese Tuina and myofascial release. He is currently studying\nfor a master\u2019s degree in Osteopathy.\nPhilip is available at Ethos on\nTuesday, Friday and Sunday and\ncan be contact on 07853 162 798\nor philip-cox@hotmail.com\nPhilip Cox\nIC participate in\nfirst-ever Hurling\ntournament\nIt was an historic weekend for Imperial College GAA, as its hurlers took to\nthe field for the first time ever in the\nannual British Universities 7-a-Sides in\nBirmingham.\nThe journey began at Victoria Coach\nstation on Friday evening, with me\nwaiting like an idiot for forty-five minutes before the coach set off. Magneto\na.k.a. Chris Farrell, Stephen Gallagher\nand Andy Lavery, however, decided\nthat running through the station to get\non the coach literally a minute before\nit was meant to set off was the best\noption.\nAfter my half-heart attack, we were\non our way. Friday night in Brum was\nspent settling in the corner of the nearest pub and splitting our holes laughing at the absolute write-off asking the\nbar staff if they\u2019d let him ride them for\na few quid and at the two delightful\nyoung ladies eating chips off the floor\nwhen we got back to the hotel.\nAfter far too little sleep, we were\npicked up from the hotel by our own\npersonal Brummie, Doot, a.k.a. Phil\nJakeman. At this point we still only had\nfive players but thankfully the other\nlads (Evin Coogan, Andy Hayes and\nBrian Gilmore) turned up at the Erin\ngo Bragh GAA grounds in time. Our\nfirst match was against Liverpool John\nMoores Uni, who were strong to say\nthe least. Clearly we hadn\u2019t woken up at\nall yet because within three minutes of\nthe ref throwing the ball in, they were\nup by two goals and a few points. The\nIC men however continued to battle\non, and Coogan and McCann notched\nup a few scores. Some Trojan work by\nHayes and Gilmore in defence stopped\nFinian McCann LJMU from completely running away\nwith it, but in the end the lead they had\nbuilt up at the start of the game proved\nto be insurmountable.\nOur next opposition were Sheffield Hallam. Dedicated followers of\nIC GAA will remember that these are\nthe shower that beat us in the semis\nof the Gaelic football championships a\nmonth earlier, so revenge was on everyone\u2019s minds.\nIC started what was to be the most\nungraceful and awkward game of\nhurling I\u2019ve ever participated in a bit\nunsteadily, but were soon imposing\nthemselves on the Sheffield boys.\nA few quick scores put us ahead, and\nmidway through the first half Stephen\nGallagher was fouled in front of the\ngoals. Coogan stepped up to take the\nfree and drove the ball into the back of\nthe net, putting Imperial 1-2 (one goal,\ntwo points) to 0-0 in front. With the\nwind behind them, Imperial continued\nto dominate. McCann, Coogan and\nHayes all converted long range points,\nand when the final whistle blew, Imperial had won 1-7 to 0-0, achieving the\ncollege\u2019s first ever hurling victory.\nBuoyed by our success, we went\ninto our final group match slightly\noptimistic, even though it was against\neventual champions Robert Gordon\nUniversity from Aberdeen. The game\nwas closely contested throughout the\nfirst half, with Evin Coogan knocking\nover a point for Imperial and everyone\nworking hard to win ball. However, one\nof the RGU forwards managed to slip\nthrough to score their first goal.\nIn the second half, Doot and Coogan\nstarted in midfield with McCann going up front, and soon after the restart,\nCoogan played the ball from midfield\ninto McCann who (Usain) bolted towards the RGU posts. Unfortunately\nthe resulting shot blazed over the bar\nfor a point rather than a goal, and that\nwas to be the last score Imperial got\nin the match. The Aberdeen side were\ngiven a bit too much space in the last\nfew minutes and converted a few more\nscores to end up winning the match\n2-5 to 0-2. Special mention goes to\nMagneto in nets who managed to stop\na blistering shot with his neck.\nAnd so ended Imperial\u2019s tournament\nfor one year, finishing up third in our\ngroup. But we did have one last thing\nto do while in Birmingham: get ham-mered. As is becoming customary\nwith IC drinking sessions, the night\nwas started off with a few bottles of\nBuckfast, followed by the possibly the\ncheapest club in Britain. The bus home\nthe next day was not as much fun\u2026\nAll in all, it was probably one the best\nweekends I\u2019ve had this year, good solid\ncraic throughout, and it wouldn\u2019t have\nhappened were it not for the help we\nreceived from a few people.\nFirst and foremost, a big thank you\nto all the lads who played at the weekend and who\u2019ve been coming to trainings for the last few weeks. I\u2019m pretty\nsure I would have laughed at someone\na year ago if they told me I\u2019d be playing\nhurling with IC but apparently with a\nbit of effort you can get anything done.\nSpecial thanks go to Frank McCann for\ndonating a set of hurls to the club and\nto Brian Gallagher for donating a set of\nsliothars and a dozen grips.\nThanks also to Katie Cullen for the\nloan of her helmet for the weekend, and\nto Phil\u2019s mum for an awesome home-cooked stew on Saturday evening.\nImperial in action against Royal Holloway\nChlo\u00e9 Sharrocks\nAndr\u00e9 Wilmes showed the right person\nhad been crowned ACC Sportsman of\nthe Year during the Easter vacation\nwhen he represented Imperial at the\nBUCS Equestrian Championships.\nFresh from a second placing at an\nInternational Student Riding Cup\ncompetition, where he represented his\nhome country of Luxembourg, Wilmes\nheaded to Arena UK, in Lincolnshire\nto contest the 3-day university national\nfinals.\nA stunning performance in the dressage phases (aka \u201cballet-for-horses\u201d)\non the first day saw Andr\u00e9 qualify for\nthe semi-finals the next day. Here his\ninternational experience helped him\nachieve a further good round and saw\nhim qualify for the finals. At this stage\nhe was guaranteed no less than second\nplace.\nThe final dressage test was a freestyle\nperformance to music that Wilmes had\nchoreographed only the night before.\nSome problems with the stereo as he\nentered the arena meant some delays\nbefore he could begin, but Wilmes held\nonto his nerve.\nRiding a borrowed horse he challenged the other finalist by performing\na very technical routine to a fun Lion\nKing melody. Sadly the other rider in\nthe final was Emily Llewelyn - representing the University of Sussex - and\ncurrent double gold medallist at under-21 level. Despite a brilliant final round,\nWilmes riding high after\nnational success\nWilmes could not surpass the current\nworld champion and he was awarded\nthe silver medal in the BUCS national\ndressage championships.\nSadly on the final day Wilmes was\nunable to qualify for the final of the\nshow-jumping championships, after\nhe was drawn a rather un-cooperating\nhorse who had already eliminated another rider.\nHowever, the second placing he\nachieved in the dressage competition\nis still the best result an Imperial rider\nhas ever achieved at the BUCS National Championships.\nWith Andr\u00e9 Wilmes remaining as\nfirst team captain of Imperial\u2019s Riding\nClub next year, there is hope of further\nindividual and team success in 2010.\nFor the second time this term, members of Imperial College GAA have\nrepresented the college at a national\nlevel. Finian McCann and Stephen\nGallagher had played for the English\nUniversities team against the Scottish Universities Shinty team back in\nJanuary, but went one better and were\nselected on the British Universities\nAll-Stars team, which is the top honour that can be bestowed upon university players. On March 14th, they\nplayed an exhibition match against the\nWarwickshire county team at the Erin\ngo Bragh GAA grounds in Birmingham. Both lads gave a good account\nof themselves, with Finian knocking\nover a score just before half-time from\nwing-forward (at the expense of his\nfavourite hurl) and Stephen creating\ntrouble for the defence up at corner-forward. In the end, the All-Stars team\nwon the game comfortably 2-14 to 1-8.\nAfter the game, each member of the\nteam was presented with a commemorative medal, with which the lads are\npictured here.\nCongratulations are also due to Edward O\u2019 Hare, who has been called up\nto the London County football panel,\nwhich competes against the best sides\nin Ireland in the National Football\nleague and the All-Ireland champion-ship. All in all, this wraps up a very successful maiden year for IC GAA, with\nteams competing (and winning) at\nnational level in both hurling and foot-ball, and with selections on intercounty\nand international teams in football and\nhurling respectively.\nIC hurlers on British AllStars team\nFinian McCann\nA\nM\nW W\nW\nImperial\u2019s All Star players Stephen Gallagher and Finnian McCann\n\n"

    "content": "6 felix Friday 8 May 2009\nComment, Opinion\n& Letters\nLet us know your views: comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLetters may be edited for length and grammar purposes\nViews on these pages are not representative of felix\nHassan Joudi is wanting something else\n\u201cWhy is the\nhuman mind\nso frequently\nnot happy with\nwhat it has, and\noccupies itself\nwith wanting\nsomething else.\u201d\nF\nor the male readers, if you\nwere anything like me when\nyou were 14 or 15 years old,\nyou would have spent much\ntime in front of the mirror,\neagerly inspecting your chin for some\nsigns of facial hair. Conversely if you\u2019re\nanything like me now, aged 19, you\u2019d\nbe moaning about how fast your beard\ngrows and complaining at how often\nyou have to shave. Instead of envying\nthe other boys in your Year 10 class\nwho already had enough of a beard\nto groom to a style of their choosing,\nyou envy the guy in your tutorial class\nwho doesn\u2019t seem to need a shave for\nmonths while you must tediously whip\nout the shaver weekly, if not more\noften.\nThis aspect of growing up is I believe\nrepresentative of the overall gulf between our thoughts and aspirations in\nchildhood, and those in adulthood. It is\nnot uncommon for young children or\nteenagers to adopt the \u201cI can\u2019t wait to\ngrow up\u201d attitude. Being older is perceived to bring more freedom: more\npower on how to spend your money or\nmore choice on what to study or where\nwork. Conversely it is not uncommon\nfor adults at times to think, \u201cI wish I\nwas still a kid.\u201d Being a child is perceived to bring less responsibility: your\nparents guarantee you have enough\nmoney and the life of simply going to\nschool and playing with friends seems\nso trouble-free and easy.\nThis scenario extends further to other fields of life, and this common desire of always wanting something else\nto fulfil our happiness is characteristic\nof the human condition. In the workplace people who have a job they aren\u2019t\nenjoying sometimes feel they just want\nto quit so they don\u2019t have to drag themselves out of bed every morning, and\ncan spend their time watching TV all\nday. Of course the fact is most unemployed people are desperately looking\nfor a job and dream of getting back\ninto work. At university the students\nwho live at home with their parents\nmay sometimes feel they\u2019re \u201cmissing\nout\u201d on a lot of fun while students living in halls will sometimes feel lonely\nor loathe having to shop, cook and iron\nfor themselves. The same can be said\nfor people eagerly looking forward to a\nholiday abroad, but then feeling homesick while they\u2019re there. In each case\npeople wish they were in the other\u2019s\nposition.\nAs human beings we have a tendency\nto subconsciously focus on what we\ndon\u2019t have, be this what we have lost:\nour childhood, or what we have yet to\nexperience: growing up. We convince\nourselves that we can\u2019t be content with\nour present situation, and in short, we\ncan forget what we already have. It\nmakes sense then, that in the Arabic\nlanguage the word for human being,\ninsaan, is actually derived from the\nword meaning forget, nasa.\nAs a personal example, it was the\nEaster holidays when I was writing this\narticle, where I was trying to balance\nmy need to revise for the upcoming exams with my desire to relax and enjoy\nthe free time. I found that during the\nday, while the rest of my family were\nout of the house and I was left alone\nwith my books and lecture notes, I\nfelt bored and thus \u201ccouldn\u2019t wait\u201d\nfor them to return in the evening so I\ncould chat to them and enjoy dinner\ntogether. However once the evening\ncame round, I found myself irritated at\ntheir presence because they distracted\nme from revising and led me to consider studying in the library instead. And\nall this in the same day!\nInterestingly this mechanism for\nwanting something else can work in\nother ways as well. In a posh banquet\nor a three-course meal, the eater can\nexpect a grandiose series of dishes.\nFirst the appetisers, then the main\ncourse will be brought forth from the\nkitchen, the savoury desserts will no\ndoubt follow, tea or coffee may be requested by the caffeine-junkies, and\nperhaps finally the post-dinner drinks.\nBut what can often happen in the eater\u2019s mind at every stage of this grandiose meal is that they enjoy the new\ntaste in their mouth for a while. But\nquickly this \u2018newness\u2019 disappears, less\npleasure is derived from eating in that\nstage, and they quickly gobble down\nthe rest of the dish as they look forward to the next stage. Much like the\ntoddler constantly asking the mother\nfor a certain toy, our moment of happiness only lasts for a few seconds before\nwe start the cycle of wanting something else again!\nThat phrase \u201cI can\u2019t wait\u2026\u201d is ubiquitous in all the scenarios mentioned.\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to go on holiday\u2026 I can\u2019t\nwait until term ends\u2026 I can\u2019t wait for\nthe desserts.\u201d In the countless self-help\nbooks out there, you can always be\nsure that ever-present on the list of top\nten ways to improve your life will be to\n\u201clive in the moment.\u201d This philosophy\nunderlies many relaxation therapies\nlike meditation, qiqong and yoga as\nwell as major world religions like Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism and Islam.\nWhile our mind often tells us we will\nonly be content when we are thinking or doing something else, our happiness and comfort is often easily\nachieved with what we already have or\nare already doing. Knowing this is one\nthing, but controlling our thoughts so\nthe words \u201cI can\u2019t wait\u2026\u201d or \u201cI wish\u2026\u201d\nare not constantly circling our heads is\nanother more difficult task. So I urge\nyou, during this exam period, or in the\nsummer holidays when you are travel-ling, working or staying at home, don\u2019t\nwish you were doing something else.\nLive in the moment.\nFor David Stewart, reality TV doesn\u2019t get more\nreal than Come Dine With Me\nD\nepending on your defi-nition, Reality TV probably started with Candid\nCamera.\nThe show filmed the\nreactions of members of the public to\npranks, such as arranging for them to\nsit behind a rigged desk which would\nsuddenly start to develop a will of its\nown. This format was copied many\ntimes: the British equivalent was called\n\u2018Beadle\u2019s About\u2019, The Richard Taylor\nInterviews, if you saw them, were essentially the same idea too. Tittilated\nby the ability to appear on TV for being\nmade a fool of, scrotum after scrotum\nof idiots went out in search of fame and\nstarted deliberately involving themselves in stupid situations; the Generation Game for instance, or Britain\u2019s got\nTalent, or in more disturbing guises,\nJackass and then Dirty Sanchez. However, none of these examples of Reality TV is genuinely \u2018Real\u2019. They are all\nessentially end-of-pier: more-or-less\nfreakish vaudeville shows for people\nwith little to no talent. They don\u2019t have\nthat whiff of Post-Modernism that\nmarks out what we would probably\nconsider to be Real \u2018Reality TV\u2019, something in the Big Brother mould. Ah, Big\nBrother: that televised catalogue of the\ndesperate antics of contestants who\nwant nothing more than a public hanging of their own self-esteem by conflict\nwith other contestants who also want\nnothing but the same thing. But again,\nas extreme as it is, Big Brother is far too\ncontrived to be Real. This is, after all, a\nprocession of increasingly socially in-ept/mentally unsound/pretty (stupid)\npeople forced into ludicrous situations\nwho would have fallen out with everyone around them anyway. You could\nhave just as much fun in a Psychiatric\nWard.\nWhat you need for Real Reality TV is\na real situation. Real conflict from real\npeople genuinely falling out with each\nother. Like a fight down a pub? Almost,\nbut not quite--a fight down a pub is\nsimply a release of tension, whereas\nfor truly great Reality TV you need a\nbuild up of tension. It needs to be ex-cruciating, almost to the point of embarrassing the viewer. It needs to make\nyou scream with pain. And you can\u2019t\nscream with pain unless you can live\nvicariously though the people there,\nunless you can (almost) completely\nand (almost) totally empathise with the\nmotivations of the people onscreen.\nFor us to empathise as much as is\nnecessary for our ultimate emotional\ntorture, we require a situation which\nis very familiar to us. Well, I am middle class. So are you. Therefore we\nneed the most middle class thing we\ncan think of--a dinner party. A dinner\nparty is an excellent choice: it is itself a\ncompetition, usually a collaborative effort by all attendees to be as aristocratic as they think that word means--an\nopportunity to show how lower middle class one is by how much effort is\nput in to show how upper middle class\nyou are. It\u2019s embarrassing by construc-tion, never mind what happens when\nyou add the pressure of having to cook\na three course meal, stick cameras in\nfront of everyone and then offer them\na cash prize if they show themselves to\nbe the most successfully middle class\nperson there. With an impossibly sarcastic voiceover continuously denigrating those boorish enough to maintain that theirs is the best food on the\nplanet you have an unbeatable recipe\nfor watchability.\nThence we have the Channel 4 programme Come Dine With Me, to\nwhich I would freely admit, I am ad-dicted. The tremendous rancour, violent malice, contempt, misanthropy,\njealousy and vitriol that such a simple\nconcept can generate is truly stagger-ing. This is not to say that all episodes\nare car crashes, but not knowing the\nresult a priori only adds to the fun. To\ngive you an example, a notable episode\nended with a woman (friend of mine,\nactually) running around the house\nwith tear stained cheeks burning sage\nleaves to purify the atmosphere when\na massive row erupted between several of the participants. Quote: \u2018That\u2019s\nfunny, I didn\u2019t think you had a heart./I\ndo darling./Really? Where?\u2019. Such inept\ninsults, because of course, they can\u2019t\njust call each other cunts and bitches\nlike any normal person would. It\u2019s like\nan anaconda of respectability trying to\ndigest a small wombat of anger \u2013 all\neyes are on whether or not it\u2019s about\nto pop.\nPerhaps the best episode ever involved a man whose most treasured\npossession was a photograph of himself standing next to David Cameron.\nHis attempt to wow his guests involved\nshopping at Netto (a northern version\nof Lidl/Aldi) for food that cost no more\nthan ten pounds to feed four people,\ndespite the fact that the show provides\n100 pounds expenses. His menu contained such wonders as a tuna and bean\nsalad. Recipe: one can of kidney beans,\none can of tuna, mix, done. Why would\nhe do something like this? I believe,\nbecause he wanted to show the other\nguests that poor people can pretend to\nbe middle class too, if only they had the\ngumption. Naturally his food was universally reviled, particularly the spray\ncream garnish on the bananas at the\nend. Add to this some unfathomable\nseat-squirming flirtation between two\nof the contestants and it\u2019s magic.\nThere\u2019s loads on the Channel 4\nCatch-Up.

The 1-0\nvictory AET means the undefeated\nWilson House team completed the\nleague and cup double to the delight\nof all the Wilsonites, past and present,\naround College.\nEvery Sunday for the first two terms,\na selection of Imperial halls of residences battle it out with each other\naround various London Parks, with the\ntop eight teams in the league then progressing to a knock-out competition.\nThe semi finals on the previous Sunday\nsaw Wilson ease past Clayponds 3-0\nwith a brace from Javier De Esteban\nChocarro, whereas Piccadilly Court\njust edged passed league runners-up\nFisher Hall with a 3-2 victory.\nThe cup final match itself was played\nat Hyde Park, with the erratic surface\ngiving the match the special magical aura that makes Interhall Football so thrilling for all those involved.\nBoth teams had brought with them\na group of supporters, with Wilson\nout numbering the Piccadilly three to\none. Chants of \u201cgimme a P, gimme a\nC\u201d came and went, with \u201cWe love you\nWilson, We do\u201d ringing throughout the\nafternoon.\nThe match itself was played with\nhigh tempo and was full of end-to\n-end action. Wilson were playing high\nup the field with the midfielders winning the aerial challenges in the middle of the park. For all their pressure\nWilson looked most dangerous from\ntheir large number of corners, with one\nheader clipping the top of the cross bar\nat the end of the first half.\nIn the second half it was Piccadilly\nwho came closest to scoring. The Wilson defence, having conceded only 4\ngoals all season, largely held tight and\nwere strongly marshalled by centre-backs Marco Aliprandi and Jamie Beal.\nWilson Keeper, and Man of the Match,\nAndy Kearney kept his fine form go-ing, denying Piccadilly through an array of first-class saves, including a tip\nover the bar and a sprawling save low\nto his right.\nCaptained by Aziz Kamara and led\nupfront by the flamboyant Diogo Geraldes, Piccadilly were deserved finalists and played their part in making the\nmatch such a tightly fought contest.\nTough challenges were flying in across\nthe park with one at 75 minutes leaving Wilson Captain Dom Bradley with\na bloody nose after a highly contested\ncorner.\u00a0\u00a0With the clock counting down\nfull-time arrived with no teams any\ncloser to getting their hands on the\ncoveted trophy.\nWith rousing team talks from both\nsides, extra-time followed. The rolling\nsubs continued to provide bursts of energy and this kept the match running\nat a frantic pace. In the earlier stages it\nwas Wilson who came closest to scoring when a pull-back from the right byline was met by Giles Ostermeijer ten\nyards out, however he placed the ball\njust wide of the left post, with the goal\nDominic Bradley\nMen\u2019s Football (AET)\nInter-halls Football\nWilson House XI 1\nPiccadilly Court XI 0\nbeckoning in front.\nWith penalties on the horizon, Wilson were the team pushing hardest\nfor the victory in the second ET pe-riod. Their hard graft was rewarded\ndeep into extra time when a quick free\nkick from the centre of the park split\nthe Piccadilly defence and was met by\nonrushing centre midfielder Dom Bradley, who with one touch nipped the\nball over the advancing keeper, for his\n16th goal of the season. Peeling away in\ncelebration he was mobbed by the Wilson players and a 20-man plus pile on\nensued, with the crowd going ecstatic\non the sideline.\u00a0\u00a0Wilson had robbed the\nmatch at the death!\nThe final few minutes were played\nout and spectacular scenes were seen\nas Wilson realised the dream double\nhad been achieved. With the new Eastside Residence opening for the next\nacademic year, Piccadilly Court\u2019s FC\nfairytale ending was wrenched away\nfrom them in the cruellest fashion.\nOn pitch Wilson House celebrations\nwere jubilant and partying continued\nthroughout the evening at The Monkey Puzzle Pub, Paddington, where\npints flowed freely long into the night.\nIt has been a fantastic year for Imperial\nLacrosse. The ladies upped their game\nin the BUCS league winning all but one\nof their matches only to lose the overall title to Brighton on goal difference.\nHowever, their brilliant season saw\nthem the highest scoring second team\nin the country and on to the BUCS\nCup. Several lacrosse workshops with\nthe England U19\u2019s head coach later, the\nladies sailed through to the quarter finals but unfortunately Exeter scored in\nextra time to narrowly take the win.\nThe men were pushed hard in their\nfirst competitive season with a jam-packed playing schedule and two difficult leagues. However, the boys took\nthis on the chest (in some cases, literal-ly!) and improved immensely this sea-son, finishing in respectable positions\nin both competitions.\nThe mixed team have been unstop-pable! Without a single loss in the\nULU league, the mixed team convincingly took the title. A further unbeaten\nrecord in the ULU Challenge Cup,\nthey stormed through to the cup final against UCL and finally won the\ndouble!\nOur annual tour to Oxford in November was a fantastic opportunity\nfor the club to bond and the newbies\nwere thoroughly tested not only by the\ndrinking but a tough match against the\nOxford University mixed team!\nLacrosse club flying high\nafter an impressive season\nElizabeth Keeling\nIn March we organised the Imperial Cup mixed tournament for 16\nteams from across the country. The\nclub managed to field two phenomenally talented teams, with Imperial\n1\u2019s getting through to the semis against\nBrighton. Unfortunately, they were too\nwell rehearsed and narrowly beat us\ninto the finals. Kit supplier Hattersleys\nprovided a stall, we held a raffle and\nran a BBQ throughout the day, earning\nthe club much needed funds. All this\nwhilst enjoying the sun and playing\nsome excellent lacrosse!\nJust one week later, the ladies and\nmixed teams took part in the National Tournament, playing against elite\nteams including the England U19s ladies squad. It was tough competition\nbut a great weekend was had by all!\nWe can now confidently say that we\nare the best Lacrosse club in the whole\nof London, so a massive thank you\nfrom me to all our members who have\nbeen around and made this a truly unforgettable year!\nImperial rugby dominant in\n2009 Middlesex sevens\nContinued from back page\nImperial Hockey Club prepares for\ntour of a lifetime\nAmanda Cheung &\nArabella Walker\nImperial College Hockey Club has arguably seen one of its most successful\nseasons in recent years, with a record\nmembership of nearly 100 committed\nstudents achieving some superb results both on and off the field. ICHC\nMen\u2019s 1st XI went through the season\nwith a better than 90% success rate in\nthe ULU Premier league and BUCS 2B\ndivision, securing both titles and gaining promotion to the Men\u2019s 1A BUCS\nleague for 2009/2010 thanks to a tense\nplay-off victory in the final week of the\nspring term.\nThe Ladies 1st XI has also had a stellar season, reaching the finals of both\nthe ULU and BUCS cups under the\nguidance of Captain Sarah Clayton,\nwho has developed a young squad into\nan exciting outfit for future years. Congratulations also go to the Men\u2019s 2nd\nXI who have secured the ULU league\ndivision 2 title with a game to spare and\nwill play in the 1st division next season.\nThey narrowly missed out on silverware in their BUCS league, finishing\nsecond, as did the Men\u2019s 3rd XI, who\nenjoyed a resurgent season under the\ncaptaincy of Andrew Bromfield. The\nLadies 2nd XI and Men\u2019s 4\u2019s have both\nimproved as the season progressed;\nthe latter recently enjoying a relaxing\nweekend excursion to Italy!\nOff the field, we have been very lucky\nto secure the sponsorship of Merrill\nLynchthisyear.Theirgeneroussupport\nhas been crucial to securing the services of a top class coach, new playing\nkit and subsidising our annual fresher\u2019s\ntour and annual dinner and we are extremely grateful for their assistance. As\nthe most sociable mixed sports club\nat Imperial, ICHC\u2019s social events have\nscaled new heights this season. Our\nfresher\u2019s tour to Brighton and the entertaining Christmas dinner were just\ntwo of the highlights from the autumn\nterm that also saw curry nights, pub\ncrawls and plenty of dressing up at the\nACC bar nights. In the spring term,\nour successful black tie annual dinner\nwas attended by over 100 people and\nour yearly mixed tournament attracted\nuniversity teams from across London\nand even a travelling outfit from the\nWest Country!\nFinally, to top off a sensational hockey season, ICHC are incredibly excited\nto announce that the destination of the\nsummer tour 2009 will be none other\nthan the magnificent, vibrant and exotic INDIA!!!\nThis summer, the best club at Imperial will be spreading its awesomeness\nfurther across the globe to conquer yet\nanother continent. We have touched\nAfrica and Europe; now it is time for\nAsia. Over 40 keen adventurers, including our very own felix editor, have\nalready signed up for this trip of a life-time, one of the biggest groups ever\nin the history of ICHC summer tours.\nThis builds on the success of tours of\nImperial College Hockey Club\nImperial College Hockey Club\nIndiaTour 2009\nBar day-night\n\u00a33 for a wrist band then \u00a31 a pint!\nFosters John Smiths\nBlackthorn Snakebite\nFrom midday in the Union!\nCome for a quick one at lunch!\nCome for the good weather!\nCome for the whole day!\nCome to celebrate the end of exams!\nTODAY\n!!!!!\nThe victorious Wilson House team celebrating with a few beers\nThe Lacrosse club on one of their many successful social nights\nImperial\u2019s winning Middlesex 7\u2019s team at Richmond Athletic\u2019s ground\nFinishes when the\n8 kegs run dry!\nthe past, which have included destinations such as Berlin, Cyprus and\nGhana.\nThis year\u2019s immense voyage is set to\ndepart on 27th June with the first stop\nbeing the capital, Delhi. The itinerary\nincludes excursions to Agra, home of\nthe Taj Mahal; a stay in the beautiful\nnorthern city of Chandigarh, and a\nmajor highlight of the tour \u2013 a wildlife safari at the Corbett National Park!\nNeedless to say, there will be a lot of\nculture (and heat!) to soak up on this\ntrip, but not without playing a few\ngames of hockey in between, after all,\nthis is a hockey tour and incidentally,\nhockey is the national sport of India!!\nImagine \u2018Slumdog Millionaire\u2019 but\nwith the inevitable drunken exploits\nand Chaz!!!\nIn preparation for the trip, an eager\nvolunteer was sent to the health centre\nto enquire about which injections and\ntablets we needed (besides lots of ibu-profen!). The list is long but on learning that it was to be a mixed tour, the\nnurse got a little bit over enthusiastic\nwith the Durex. This might be a little\nsuperfluous to requirement as there\nis a marvellous place called the Condom Bar in Chandigarh which we will\nno doubt conveniently stop over. The\nHindustan Times describes it as having \u2018Interiors decorated with real con-doms, beer mugs in the condom shape,\nstaff dresses with condom prints... a bar\ncum discotheque...... like none other in\nIndia.\u2019 If you did not notice the obvious\nhilarious pun there then you have not\nbeen revising as long as I have!\nThe second half of the tour will take\nthe group on a train journey through\nthe heart of India all the way to Kolkata, where we will be collaborating with\nFuture Hope, a charity that provides\nshelter, education, medical aid and\nopportunity to children and orphans\nsuffering from extreme poverty. Today, there are six Future Hope homes\nin Kolkata and a school that provides\nactivities, sport and teaching programmes so there are going to be plenty of things we can do to help them out\nand support the children of the com-munity, including coaching the children and contributing with community work. Another charitable aim of\nour trip is to bring along some hockey\nsupplies (especially goalie kits which\nare really expensive) to be donated to\nsome of the teams we play or train.\nThis two week tour to one of the\nmost remarkable places in the world\nwould not have been possible without\nMerrill Lynch, the generous sponsor of\nICHC.

Your support will be\ngreatly appreciated!\nOne thing is for certain \u2013 this year\u2019s\nhockey tour is promising to be one big\nepic adventure!\nLast summer\u2019s touring hockey side to Germany\nwere dangerous.\nThe last pool game was against LSE,\nproved more testing yet Imperial still\nproduced a 26-7 victory, which secured\ntheir place in the final.\nThe final would be played against\nKings College Medicals. This same\nteam had secured promotion into\nSouth Premiership B and earlier this\nyear surprised everyone by defeating\nImperial Medics in the UH Cup final,\na competition that the Medicals have\nwon for several years. The pace of the\ngame was the highest so far and Imperial were the first team to concede\npoints. The next few moments were\nchallenging, but after regaining composure Imperial were able to secure\npossession and run in the tries. Again\nTom Carroll and Joseph Brown scored\ntwo a piece, with Nick Johnstone adding to the tally to make the final score\n35-7.\nHaving retained the title for another\nyear, Imperial proved once again how\ngreat they were at sevens, with Captain\nJoe Brown collecting the Silverware.\nLet\u2019s hope for the same next year!\n\n"

The government has banned all pork\nimports from Mexico, the US, and now Canada. Mexican and Canadian authorities have criticized the decisions, and the World Health Organisation\n(WHO) has asked China to justify its discriminatory measures.\nMeanwhile, Egyptian police have\nclashed with local pig farmers attempting to resist the government-ordered cull of the country\u2019s 300,000\npigs. The pigs belong, and are mostly\nconsumed by Egypt\u2019s Coptic Christian minority, who say the cull has\nreignited religious tension in the predominantly Muslim country. No case\nof swine flu has yet been reported in\nEgypt.\nChina and Egypt\nPolitics in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s largest democracy, are notoriously\ncomplicated.\nThe general elections in 2007 were widely regarded as the most flawed in\nthe nation\u2019s history. On the road to the next general elections in 2011, the recent regional elections in the south-western Ekiti State have caused tensions\nto flare amidst allegations of vote rigging. The poll was marred by the most\nflagrant outbreaks of political thuggery and irregularities seen since 2007.\nFrequent power shortages and a high crime rate are Nigerian trademarks,\nand the country is rife with corruption and fraud. All this is scaring businesses from investing, even though Nigeria has 150 million people and is\nseen as an emerging market. To reverse this perception, the new minister\nof information, Dora Akunyili,\nhas launched a rebranding cam-paign, with the slogan \u2018Nigeria:\nGood People, Great Nation\u2019, but\nwithout tackling the root causes\nof Nigeria\u2019s problems, a mere\nfacelift is unlikely to attract\ninvestors.\nNigeria\nWe are looking for HAYFEVER\nsufferers and NORMAL\nVOLUNTEERS to help with\nallergy research\nIf you are interested in taking part in research to\nhelp us understand the causes of nasal allergies\nand develop new forms of treatment, and if\nyou are between 18 and 55 years old please\ncontact us for more information:\nTelephone 0787 285 0275\nor email your contact details to\na.goldstone@imperial.ac.uk\nDepartment of Allergy\nRoyal Brompton & Harefield NHS Trust\nand NHLI Ethics Commitees\nFulham Road, London SW3 6HP\nThe research has been approved by the Brompton Harefield & NHLI Research Ethics Committee\nVodafone scholarships for\nImperial engineers\nUndergraduates in the Faculty of Engineering are benefiting from a new and\nprestigious scholarship scheme thanks\nto a generous donation from The Vodafone Group Foundation.\nIndividual engineering departments\nhave awarded prestigious Vodafone\nGroup Foundation Technology Scholarships to two undergraduates, one\nfrom the UK and one from overseas,\non the basis of their outstanding academic merit.\nThe scholars are currently in their\nfirst year at Imperial and, thanks to the\nscholarship scheme, both their tuition\nfees and living costs will be funded for\nthe entirety of their undergraduate\nstudies.\nThe students are Chee Yan Shek,\nstudying Mathematics and Computer\nScience, and Ms Yanyan Jiang, studying Biomedical Engineering.\n\u201cThe scholarship has taken away a\nlot of the worry about debt whilst I\u2019m\nstudying, which has enabled me to\nfocus more freely on other aspects of\nmy course and student life in general,\u201d\ncomments Chee Yan Shek.\n\u201cLife at Imperial is more demanding than I had initially anticipated,\u201d she\ncontinues. \u201cIt took me quite a while to\nsettle into the new environment and\nat times, trying to balance work with\nplay was a challenge. If I hadn\u2019t been\nawarded the scholarship it would have\nbeen much more difficult.\u201d\nWorking in conjunction with the\nCollege\u2019s EnVision initiative, the scholarships are not only aimed at rewarding excellence, but also at levelling the\nplaying field for engineering study at\nImperial by enabling the most talented\nundergraduates to attend the College\nregardless of means.\nEnVision seeks to ensure that every\nengineering student at Imperial College is offered the best possible edu-cation. It aims to guarantee that each\nImperial engineering graduate will be\narmed with the knowledge, skills and\naptitude required to become world\nclass leaders in every sphere of the\nsector.\n\u201cImperial College has an important\nobligation to encourage outstanding\nstudents to excel in its academic en-vironment. An excellent way of doing\nthis is by encouraging the brightest\nstudents to study engineering here and\nrewarding their talent, and schemes\nsuch as the Vodafone Group Foundation Technology Scholarships help\nus to do just that,\u201d explains Professor\nStephen Richardson, Principal of the\nFaculty of Engineering.\nImperial College and the Vodafone\nGroup Foundation share a common\nambition to contribute to the global\nengineering talent pool and to stimulate innovation in the sector. Through\nthe Vodafone Group Foundation Technology Scholarships, Vodafone is making a real and tangible contribution\ntowards these goals which will ultimately benefit the engineering sector\nas a whole.\n\u201cWe are delighted to work with Imperial College on this fantastic initiative,\u201d says Andrew Dunnet, Director of\nThe Vodafone Group Foundation.\n\u201cVodafone is committed to investing\nin the cultivation of the next generation of engineers and maximising the\nfuture scientific potential of the UK. It\nis imperative that institutions such as\nImperial College continue to attract\nand reward talented students into en-gineering, and the Vodafone Group\nFoundation Scholarships are a great\nway of doing just that.\u201d\nRector criticises\ngovernment funding policy\nat Postgraduate ceremonies\nThe College saw around 1,600 students\ngraduating with higher degrees in sci-ence, engineering, medicine and business on Wednesday at the Postgraduate\nAwards Ceremony. Honorary degrees\nwere also given to philanthropists Jeremy and Hannelore Grantham, whose\nGrantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment has funded\nresearch institutes on climate change\nat Imperial as well as at LSE over the\npast few years.\nTwo fellowships were also awarded\nto members of staff who have contributed greatly to the life of the College.\nThe first of these is Professor Tom Kibble who has been at Imperial for over\n50 years and was Head of Department\nof Physics from 1983-1991. The second\nfellowship was given to Sir Leszek Borysiewicz, now Chief Executive of the\nMedical Research Council and formerly Principal of the Faculty of Medicine\nand then Deputy Rector at Imperial.\nGraduation ceremonies at Imperial\nhave been a traditional time for Rectors\nto make their feelings clear on a range\nof matters, most notably the quality of\nthe students that we produce and the\nstate of the science and technology sector in the UK. This was no exception.\nSir Roy Anderson told the graduates\nthat \u201cI find it inspiring to see this Hall\nfilled with people who have chosen to\ninvest their time, effort and finances in\nscience, technology, and business, who\nhave excelled as a result.\u201d\n\u201cI strongly believe that your investment is one that will bring significant\nreward. The benefits are long-term\nand far-reaching for individuals and\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nfor nations.\u201d\nHis views, however, on the government\u2019s spending policy was not as flattering with Sir Roy making similarities\nwith the US and their input into the\nscience, research and development\nsectors. Sir Roy told the 1,600 or so\npostgraduates that \u201cin March this year,\nPresident Barack Obama announced\nthat he would invest over $21 billion\nin US science as part of his economic\nstimulus package. He also wants his\ncountry to spend 3% of GDP on research and development.\u201d\n\u201cI hope that the UK government will\nbe inspired by his example and also\nmake substantial investments in the\nscience and technology base of this\ncountry. The future of our country and\nour world depends on scientific innovation and invention.\u201d\nThis is not the first time that Rector has criticised the lack of support\nfrom the UK government in supporting the science community in the UK,\nhowever, his views on the matter have\nbeen more and more open. Back in\nFebruary, Sir Roy hinted that there was\na problem with their spending in his\ninterview with felix, commenting \u201cthat\nthere are three or four areas of government expenditure where a lot of money\ncould be saved\u201d\nThe Rectors attacks on the government are likely to continue in the near\nfuture as graduates are finding it increasingly hard to find jobs in the current economic climate.\nAnd Finally: Paxman to donate his brain to\nthe Imperial brain bank\nImperial College will be the holder of\nanother great mind, but in an entirely\ndifferent way.\nBBC broadcaster Jeremy Paxman is\nto donate his brain to Imperial-based\nBrain Bank, once he has died.

After their 2007 set in\nthe Radio 1 tent at Reading Festival,\none Guardian reviewer commented\nthat it would be \u201chard to imagine them\nas headliners\u201d. This stemmed mostly\nfrom the lightness of their offerings,\nboth in lyrical content and musical\ndexterity. Singles like \u201cToothpaste Kisses\u201d were certainly catchy and pulled\nat the heartstrings but they didn\u2019t do\nmuch else; if you were a 15 year-old\nwith a crush, their first album seemed\nlike a bruisingly sincere account of love\nand its tribulations \u2013 if you were a real\nperson it was fun but ultimately pointless and banal.\nNo more. With their new album Wall\nof Arms, The Maccabees have firmly\nthrown off the negative connotations\nof the label \u2018indie-pop\u2019 and given people who don\u2019t wear Fred Perry polos\na reason to listen to them. They have\nabandoned the ditzy sounds and mindless lyrics of Colour It In and have\nstruck a confident tone with thoughtful lyrics and an inventive, challenging\nand varied sound. In one fell-swoop\nthey\u2019ve managed to tap into the trium-phalism of The Killers, the sharpness\nof the Arctic Monkeys and the lyrical\npower of Oasis.\nWall of Arms explodes open with\ntheir new single \u201cLove You Better\u201d. The\nband\u2019s distinctive guitar riff is ever\npresent but the moment front-man\nOrlando Weeks opens his mouth it\u2019s\nobvious that his unique vocal style has\nbeen used to its full potential. The lyrics explore the darker side of love suggesting their youthful innocence has\nbeen damaged, broken by the experience of love. Orlando delivers these\nwith a striking melodious power. Songs\nlike \u201cWilliam Powers\u201d are demonstrative of the band\u2019s greater maturity.\nHowever, this album isn\u2019t a great\ndeparture from The Maccabees that\nmade their own music videos and sang\nabout burning girl\u2019s dresses with their\ncigarettes. They haven\u2019t suddenly gone\nall Editors on their fans. They have\nstill retained their singalong feel, a\nfact made obvious on the stage, their\nnew material already has the feel of old\nclassics, with the audience screaming\nback every lyric, anticipating the lows\nand bracing themselves for the roaring\nhighs. They\u2019ve lost none of their energy and this is clear on tracks like \u201cCan\nYou Give It\u201d and \u201cYoung Lions\u201d.\nBy their own admission the band\u2019s\nfirst album was recorded in dribs and\ndrabs, more a collection of singles than\na record in its own right. Not this time\naround, the band worked solidly on the\nalbum in locations like Liverpool and\nParis and recorded it under the direction of producer Markus Dravs; who\nalso produced Arcade Fire\u2019s Neon Bible. The effort has certainly paid off.\nThealbumhasbeenvariouslydescribed\nas \u201cflying off at unexpected angles\u201d and\na \u201cdistinctly darker second long-player\u201d\nbut in simple terms this album reveals\nsomething new on each listen. Multilayered and compelling, it draws you in\nand gives you cause to wonder whether\nindie music is quite dead yet.\nNo longer lightweights, when The\nMaccabees return to Reading this August it\u2019ll be the triumphant return of a\nband that has truly arrived.\nEmotionally powerful, this four-piece\ngroup spin their tales with the magic of\nan old, wizened story-teller. Their lyrics have the strength to stand on their\nown as pure poetry, but Marcus Mumford\u2019s delivery renders them sublime.\nThe label \u2018folk\u2019 may carry negative\nconnotations for people who\u2019s musical curiosity involves checking who\u2019s\nNumber One on a Sunday evening.\nBut if you bother to look, you\u2019ll find\nin Mumford & Sons a band that says\nsomething more meaningful in a word\nthan Coldplay do in an entire album.\nTheir music isn\u2019t plodding either. It\ndoesn\u2019t simply serve as a backing for\nsome depressing romantic monologue,\nit\u2019s wild and heart thumping, moving\nyou physically as well as emotionally.\nOn tracks like \u201cRoll Away Your\nStone\u201d, their music lifts you up, slows\nsuddenly and then whisks you away in\na whirlwind of banjo, have a listen and\nI dare you to resist your body\u2019s desire\nfor a hoe-down (the waistcoat wearer\u2019s\nequivalent of a rave).\nSupporting The Maccabees, the\nband face an audience unaccustomed\nto their sounds and roundly win them\nover with the cheers growing louder\nafter each song.\nThey finish with \u201cDustbowl Dance\u201d,\na song which you\u2019ll have to see them\nperform live to hear unfortunately (you\ncan find some poor quality videos on\nYouTube), is pure proof of this. The\nband are right to keep this track exclusive to their performances as it is as\nmuch a song as it is an experience. It\u2019s\nbleak, disturbing and oddly exhilarating as the band unleash the full fury of\ntheir emotions upon their instruments,\ncompletely destroying your expectations of the word \u2018folk\u2019.\nMumford & Sons aren\u2019t hollow or\nwooden, they\u2019re loud and booming\nand completely dominate the venue.\nTed Dwane\u2019s double bass thunders into\nyour body. Marcus Mumford\u2019s voice\ngrabs you by the heart. The band exude energy, putting their all into every\nnote. In the gaps between songs, they\nseem to awake from a trance, cracking\njokes with the audience, before diving\nback into their music; grabbing you\nby the arm and taking you along with\nthem.\nKadhim Shubber\nBet you didn\u2019t\nknow, biatch\nThe album art was created by\nacclaimed artist Boo Ritson.\nThe band members were physically covered in paint and photographed to create the unique ef-fect. The album is out now.\nThe Maccabees (from left) Rupert Jarvis, Orlando Weeks, Hugo White, Sam Doyle and Felix White\nBand members:\nMarcus Mumford (pictured),\nWinston Marshall, Ben Lovett and\nTed Dwane.\nBackground\nMarcus was writing songs and\n\u201cripping off Shakespeare\u201d in his\nuniversity bedroom in Edinburgh. He\nwas reunited with old friend Winston\nMarshall when the latter\u2019s bluegrass\nact, Captain Kick & The Cowboy\nRamblers, performed in the city. They\nfirst started performing together at\nthe Bosun\u2019s Locker on London\u2019s Kings\nRoad with another friend, Ben Lovett,\naka Ben Lovett Bloody Loves It on\nkeyboards \u2013 Marcus used to play\ndrums with BLBLI in a jazz band..\nMarcus then met Ted Dwayne and\nMumford & Sons were born.\nSounds like:\nFolk-pop, anti-folk, nu-folk, blah\nblah. Whatever label you want to use\ntheir talent is undeniable. Marcus\nMumford\u2019s talented story-telling\ncombined with his passionate voice\ntug at the heartstrings; with some\npowerful bass and a little banjo\nthrown in for good measure. Listen\nto it alone, your heart will be moved;\nlisten with friends, your feet will.\nLondon\u2019s folk\nrevival\nAlong with artists like Laura\nMarling, Noah & the Whale and\nJohnny Flynn, Mumford & Sons have\nspearheaded the recent explosion\nof all things London-folk. By no\nmeans a random coming together,\nmany of the bands are good friends\nand have toured extensively with\neach other (even appearing in each\nother\u2019s music videos). Surprisingly,\nMumford are as yet unsigned and\nunfortunately not on Spotify. You can\nfind them on Myspace, I recommend\n\u201cRoll Away Your Stone\u201d\nsource: The Guardian\nMumford & Sons\n@ Electric Ballrooms\n5th May\nHHHH\nElectric Six haven\u2019t lost their spark\nGreg Power\nElectric Six. If you are reading this gig\nreview I\u2019ll assume that like me you\nrocked out to their hit singles \u201cDanger!\nHigh Voltage\u201d and \u201cGay Bar\u201d way back\nin 2003. Though many naively believe\nthese Detroit rockers were simply one\nhit wonders (or should I say two hit\nwonders) the band managed to build a\nsteady fanbase with their kick-ass \u201cFire\u201d\ndebut. Then came their second album\n\u201cSenor Smoke\u201d, which turned out to be\na steaming pile of shit. But contrary\nto popular belief, Electric Six did not\ndie there and then. After numerous\nline-up changes, they released 3 more\nalbums, their latest being \u201cFlashy\u201d, a\nsleazy disco-rock-metal-funk affair.\nThough I\u2019d never considered them a\ngreat band, I couldn\u2019t resist the temptation when I saw they were still around\nand playing at the Camden Barfly. After catching up on their latest releases\n- especially the pure comedy genius of\nthirdalbum\u201cSwitzerland\u201d-myfriend&\nI headed to Camden expecting a mildly\nentertaining night. Instead, we walked\nstraight into one hell of a party.\nThe Barfly was full, and we ended\nup grabbing the last two tickets avail-able. Thankfully, we missed the opening band Tragedy: a Metal Tribute to\nthe Beegees (trust me, not as cool as it\nsounds). So we waited, beer in hand,\namongst a packed crowd of extremely diverse fans: from dread-wielding\npunks, to a couple of sixty-year old hip-pies, all the way to five massive dudes\nwearing ridiculous hats. Obviously\nElectric Six appeal to a wide range of\npeople, but everyone there had one\nthing in common: they knew how to\nparty. Hard.\nThe lights went out and Electric Six\nwalked on stage, at which point everybody went crazy. The band kicked\nthe night off with the incredible \u201cIt\u2019s\nShowtime!\u201d, and for a bunch of guys\ntoo often labelled as a \u201cjoke band\u201d,\nthey rocked the house. Heavy riffs,\none massively distorted bass, pounding drum beats and falsetto screams\nfilled the room like love juice from\nFunky Heaven. Of course everybody\u2019s\neyes were on Dick Valentine that night,\ndonning a sexy purple cape and matching crown. The awkward, over-the-top\ncampy frontman has always claimed\nmost of his lyrics are about \u201cabsolutely\nnothing\u201d, and regularly abuses of the\nwords \u201cdance\u201d, \u201cdrugs\u201d, \u201cgirls\u201d, \u201ctonight\u201d,\n\u201clouder\u201d, \u201cparty\u201d, and of course his fa-vourite, timeless word \u201cfire\u201d. He was hi-larious, cracking ridiculously bad jokes\nall night, obviously drunk as hell.\nThey played through two hours of\nsongs taken from their entire back\ncatalogue, including fan-favourites\n\u201cImproper Dancing\u201d, \u201cRock and Roll\nEvacuation\u201d, \u201cFormula 409\u201d, the fist-pumping \u201cDown at McDonnellzzz\u201d,\nand the ultimate party song \u201cI Buy\nThe Drugs\u201d (if you haven\u2019t heard it,\ndo yourself a favour and check it out\non Youtube). And yes, as well as \u201cHigh\nVoltage\u201d, they played \u201cGay Bar\u201d. And\nyes, it was buckwild. They even played\n\u201cGay Bar Part II\u201d, ironically a completely unrelated, but equally rocking\npiece. Between songs, Dick Valentine\u2019s\nwitty (read drunken) banter about how\nbadass his new drummer is, or how all\nBrits must love Blur, received laughs\nand applause from everybody in the\nroom.\nThis is a band that has been touring\nnon-stop since they first appeared on\nthe scene, and though their albums\nhave never been consistently great,\nthey have enough catchy songs and\nexperience on the road to play a tight,\nheavy, fun and - most importantly -danceable set.\nWithout a doubt it was some of the\nmost light-hearted entertainment I\u2019ve\nseen this side of Gogol Bordello. Everybody in that room had barrels of\nfun, the \u201cmosh pits\u201d were basically just\nstrangers hugging each other and dancing like it was the 80s all over again.\nMy highlight of the night was seeing a\nhardcore punk asking one of the guys in\nthe novelty white Navy hats: \u201cR.A.F.?\u201d\nquizzically. The guy smiled back with\nIt\u2019s Eurotrash time again\nPreviously on Eurovision Song Contest\u2026 we saw the magnificent eyebrows\nof Turkey\u2019s singer; watched the barely\nclothed ladies of Greece and Ukraine;\nmarveled at the Swedish singer\u2019s excessively large forhead; got scared by\nRodolfo Chikilicuatre of Spain; and\nwere deeply saddened by the fact that\nthe UK had finally sent a Eurovisionstyle song, and still did not earn a better result.\nDima Bilan swept to victory for Russia with \u201cBelieve\u201d, sung in English, ac-cessorised with violinist Edvin Marton\nand Olympic gold medallist figure\nskater, Evgeni Plushenko. Marton was\nvery skilful. Plushenko was unbelievably stunning. Bilan wore a white ensemble with a bare chest. He was a bit\ndull.\nEurovision Song Contest is an annual music extravaganza with tonnes of\nglitter and short skirts, this year being\nbrought to us from Russia on Saturday\n16th May. Countries that form part\nof the European Broadcasting Union\nare allowed to send entries, as long as\nthey do not offend any other participant \u2013 Georgia has already bowed out\nof this year\u2019s contest as their song was\nnot very friendly with the host coutry,\nRussia. This year, 18 and 19 countries\ncompete in semifinals 1 and 2 respec-tively; an even balance of televotes and\njuryvotes will decide on 10 entries going forward to the grand finale. In the\nbig final, the twenty best scorers from\nthe semis will join the Big Four (UK,\nFrance, Germany and Spain), as well\nas the previous year\u2019s winner, in a big\nmelody-fest where the winner will be\ndecided upon by the viewing public.\nSetting the scene for this year\u2019s ex-travaganzaatOlympiyskiIndoorArena\nin Moscow, 42 countries have entered\nartists with songs belonging to a mul-Jia-Ou Song titude of genres. Bookmakers around\nthe continent have had their say and\nare collecting money with big fishing nets as you read. We have trawled\nthrough the top 10 and the top 10 from\nthe bottom to see if we could find some\ngood stuff. (rankings from bet365)\nNorway [Alexander Rybak - \u201cFairytale\u201d] (Placed first) Young male singer\nwith wonderful violin skills would like\nto meet upbeat eastern-style europop.\nThere is a certain swing to it, but I\nfound that it takes a few listenings for\nit to catch on. 4/5\nGreece [Sakis Rouvas - \u201cThis Is Our\nNight\u201d](Placed 2nd) Electronic dance\nmusic meets tall-dark-handsomeness.\nThis number islightly overdependent\non Sakis Rouvas, and not enough on\nthe song itself, which in turn is quite a\nplain piece of dance music. 2/5\nTurkey [Hadise - \u201cD\u00fcm Tek Tek\u201d]\n(Placed 3rd) This is a rhythmic song,\nwith evident Eastern influences.\nWhere the artist has great stage pres-ence, the overall presentation could be\nimproved upon for the final. 3/5\nMontenegro [Andrea Demirovi\u0107\u201cJust Get Out of My Life\u201d] (Placed 4th)\nThink eastern-european pop princess.\nCatchy, but rather plain pop; the refrain is very repetitive. Hmm\u2026 make\nthat very catchy. 3/5\nAzerbaijan [AySel and Arash - \u201cAlways\u201d] (Placed 5th) Male and female\nsinger with not very exciting harmo-nies. But it is spicy, in a good way. 3/5\nMalta [Chiara - \u201cWhat If We\u201d]\n(Placed 6th) A power ballad. Awesome\nvoice. Then again, last year\u2019s winner\nsang a ballad, what are the chances?\n3/5\nSweden [Malena Ernman \u2013 \u201cLa\nVoix\u201d] (Placed 7th) A coloratura soprano\u2019s opera-pop. Nessum D\u2019Orma\nmeets Kylie Minogue. It runs the fly or\nflop risk, but it is nice to have something different. I personally love it. 5/5\nUnited Kingdom [Jade Ewen \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s\nMy Time\u201d] (Placed 8th) Another big\nballad penned by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Diane Warren.Wrong song,\nright act. It will be interesting to see\nhow this fares, as Britain has not seen\nthe upper half of the scoreboard for\nsome time now. 4/5\nSpain [Soraya Arnelas - \u201cLa noche\nes para m\u00ed\u201d] (Placed 9th) Sounds like\nnight club during holiday season. Sung\nin Spanish \u2013 good. The big four have\nnot done very well since the start of the\nmillenium, could this year be the year?\n3/5\nBosnia & Herzegovina [Regina\u201cBistra voda\u201d] (Placed 10th) Very eth-nic. Performance could depend on\npresentation. 3/5\nBelarus [Petr Elfimov - \u201cEyes That\nNever Lie\u201d] (Placed last) More 80\u2019s\nsynth rock. Sung by Elvis-wannabe\nwith long blonde hair. Better than Macedonia, and the voice is fantastic. 4/5\nCroatia[Igor Cukrov feat. Andrea\n- \u201cLijepa Tena\u201d] (Placed 41st) Kudos\nfor singing in own language. The song\nfeatures a very pretty tune, but doesn\u2019t\nquite pack the punch required to land\na good result. The artists aren\u2019t very\nexciting either \u2013 a mismatched duo\nseems to be the words coming to mind.\n2/5\nLatvia[Intars Busulis - \u201cProbka\u201d[]\n(Placed 40th) A bit manic. Lots of\nsounds happening at once. Would like\nto see stage presentation. This song is\nabout sitting in a traffic jam, and that is\njust the way it feels. 0/5\nCzech Republic [Gipsy.cz - \u201cAven\nRomale\u201d] (Placed 39th) A bit too cartoonish for me. Remember the Romanian knitting brides from last year?\nLatvia\u2019s pirates? A bit like that. 1/5\nHungary [Zoli \u00c1dok - \u201cDance with\nMe\u201d] (Placed 38th) Oh my. Very disco.\nTune does not sound \u201cfresh\u201d; I cannot\nsay anything special about it. May accomplish more things in a commercial\nsetting. 1/5\nFYR Macedonia[Next Time\u201cNeshto shto ke ostane\u201d] (Placed 37th)\nRocker image + 80\u2019s synth + mediocre\nvocals = faux pas. 1/5\nAndorra [Susanne Georgi - \u201cLa teva\ndecisi\u00f3 (Get a Life)\u201d] (Placed 36th)\nDoes not \u201cpop\u201d. In fact, it screams\ntweenpop and not in the best way. The\nartist is sweet and simple, but not the\nideal thing to take to Eurovision. 0/5\nSlovakia [Kamil Mikul\u010d\u00edk and Nela\nPociskov\u00e1 - \u201cLe\u0165 tmou\u201d] (Placed 35th) I\nfind it a pleasant song, with a gripping\nrefrain that is not done justice by the\nsingers. No more. 2/5\nPoland [Lidia Kopania - \u201cI Don\u2019t\nWanna Leave\u201d](Placed 34th) Love the\ntune and the voice. Would have been\na great commercial release. It may suffer from the fact that Malta\u2019s ballad has\nhad much more publicity. 4/5\nCyprus[ChristinaMetaxa-\u201cFirefly\u201d]\n(Placed 33rd) On the far side of Alanis\nMorissette, with a bad voice. I really do\nnot know what this song is doing on\nthe Eurovision stage. They\u2019re working\nthe organic look in their video, whereas Eurovision is mostly bling. 0/5\nPerhaps I will be eating my words\nsoon, but you know what they say:\n\u201cwhat happens at Eurovision, stays in\u2026\nhnnn\u2026.\u201d\na massive grin and simply answered\n\u201cNo. DANCE COMMANDER!\u201d before\nbreaking out into funky dance moves\nand jumping on top of his mates.\nEnding on the anthemic \u201cGermans\nIn Mexico\u201d and its riveting chorus of\n\u201cSing everybody, Deutsche Deutsche,\nVaya Con Dios Amigos\u201d, the entire\nroom, arm in arm, lovingly waved the\nband goodbye, after an exhilarating\nnight that actually turned out to be\nmore of a wild party than a gig. Electric Six are far from dead. And though\nsadly by many they will only ever be\nremembered as \u201cthe Gay Bar band\u201d, for\nthose really in the know, they are very\nmuch the best party band in the entire\nworld.\nMumford & Sons\nExpect to see more of this at this years Eurovison Song Contest\nYou, yes you there... I want to take you to the gay bar, gay bar, gay bar\n\n"
