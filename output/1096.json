    "content": "ELECTIONS 31 October 1997\nElections!\nElections!\nREAD ALL ABOUT ITI\nOh joy, oh rapture, it's time for the another re-run of the 1997\nsabbatical elections, which means you have to get off your\nW firm rum\nrum ruin\nbackside and get to the polling booths. Two posts are to be\nfilled; President of ICU - which is still vacant after three\nattempts to fill it last year all returned New Election - and\nDeputy President (Clubs and Societies) - which last year's candidate could not fill for academic reasons.\nThree students have stood for these positions, and their\nmanifestos are below - take the time to read them and decide\nwho you like best.\nIf you've got any sense, you'll want to meet the candidates\nin the flesh, hear them speak, and ask questions. This is what\nthe Hustings is all about. Each candidate makes a speech and\nis then grilled by the spectators. Hustings are 6pm Monday 3\nMark Baker\nSTANDING FOR PRESIDENT\nFor three years I 've enjoyed being part of ICU - going to the\nCarnivals, being involved in the clubs and surviving almost\nentirely on cheap curries. This year I am Publications Board\nChair, but with the tragic failure to elect a President last term,\nI now have to opportunity to do even more for ICU and its\nmembers.\nI have the experience necessary to do this job. The\nAndrew\nHeeps\nSTANDING FOR PRESIDENT\nOn August I st, Imperial College permanently changed. We\nstand on the brink of a new century, a century where the\nworld's leading scientists, engineers and doctors will all come\nfrom Imperial College.\nPresident will start work immediately, and miss out on a summer of training, so it is vital to elect a candidate who fully\nunderstands the Union.\nI possess excellent communication skills - the President\nneeds to be able to converse effectively with both College and\nstudents. I aim to make the governance of ICU more visible to\nthe ordinary students, by public ising important meetings and\nusing the Web to provide minutes and introductions to the\nmany committees.\nI am professional - I have recently completed 6 months in\nindustry, and took a year out before coming to IC, when I worked in a leading research laboratory.\nICU needs to recognise that it is a multi-campus organ-Charlie Joynt\nSTANDING FOR DEPUTY PRESIDENT (CLUBS AND SOCIETIES)\nIt is no surprise that much of our social ising is based around\nthe societies that we join. We have over 180 clubs that we can\nsign up for, and most of us choose to be members of a few of\nthem at the very least. With the mergers of the medical\nschools, and next year's integration of ICSM into the South\nKensington campus, we must strive to broaden the width of the\nNew Election\nSTANDING FOR ALL POSTS\nNew Election is standing for all posts in this election, but who\nis this elusive and daring candidate and why vote for this\noption? New Election - RON for short - is the one to vote for if\nyou don't think the other candidates are up to the job. If New\nElection gets in there will automatically be another election for\nthat post. This in theory should enable you to take your pick\nfrom a new crop of candidates that are hopefully better than\nthe last lot. Therefore, if you feel that the candidates standing\nfor any post are not up to the job, VOTE NEW ELECTION.\nOf course, there is a disadvantage; if New Election does\nwin we have to go through all of this again. So please, for all\nour sake s, think before voting.\nThere are many ways you can assess the quality of the can-di dates. If you want to ask the candidates questions attend the\nelection hustings or alternatively you could just read the mani-fes to s, interviews in Felix and posters round College. Whatever\nyou choose to do make an informed choice and use your vote\neffectively. If somebody you like doesn't get elected or some-\n"

    "content": "NEWS 31 October 1997\nMeningitis Monster Strikes Again\nOnce again, the new university\nyear has been greeted with outbreaks of deadly meningitis\nappearing in student halls of res-i den ce. Last year, three students from\nthe University of Cardiff died from\nthe disease during the first term.\nControversy surrounded the out-break, as official guidelines suggested that cases more than four\nweeks apart were unconnected.\nSince the first two cases were four\nweeks and one day apart, the\nhealth authorities responsible\ntreated them as isolated incidents.\nIt was only later, after more cases\nwere identified, and another student had died, that the cases were\nfound to have a common link. The\nguidelines have since been\nchanged.\nThis year has already seen two\nnew cases of meningitis in Cardiff,\nand the university and health\nauthorities moved quickly to distribute information about the\nlinke s, and antibiotics have been\ngiven to those close to the two\nmen involved.\nMeningitis comes in two main\nforms, bacterial and viral. The bacterial form is much rarer, and is\nmore severe. However, the form\nthat surfaced this year in Cardiff is\nnot as virulent as last year's. Students of Southampton\nUniversity have been hit by a far\nConference Centre\nGoes from Strength to\nStrength\nThe latest, un audited, figures\nrecently presented in a Managment and Planning Group\n(MPG) report show the\nConference Centre making a heavy\nloss in 1996-97 for the third year\nrunning. The year finished with a net deficit of over \u00a340,000 (see\ngraph).\nThe centre has already been\nunder the spotlight for failing to\nprofit from the Fashion Week deal\n(Felix 1094) and a huge overspend\non furniture and office development (Felix 1095).\nStaff costs appear to be the\nmain financial drain on the centre,\nrepresenting 56% of total sales in\n1995-96. Felix has also heard that\nsummer accommodation was let\nout this year in block-bookings for\nas little as \u00a3 10 per night per room.\nThis lead to one Language School\nsub-letting the rooms to other\ncompanies, which is forbidden.\nIt is believed that the\nConference Centre are facing an\ninternal audit to investigate its pro-cee dure s and poor performance.\nCONFERENCE CENTRE NET\nPROFIT / LOSS 1993 - 1997\n\u00a320,000\nzero\n-\u00a320,000\n-\u00a340,000\n-\u00a360,000\n*Figure not yet audited. All other figures from annual fina cn i al statements\nmore dangerous form, though, and\nthis has led to the death of two stu-dents, with two more infected.\nNone have been named, but are\nthought to be 19 year old first\nyears living in the same hall of res-i den ce, though they are studying\ndifferent subjects. More than 1,000\nstudents will be treated with antibiotics as a precautionary measure.\nIn an unrelated case, a third student has also been killed at\nLeicester University.\nMeningitis is preventable and\ncurable if detected early enough,\nbut the disease can progress to an\nadvanced stage in a matter of\nhours. It disease is spread by\ngerms passing from the nose and\nmouth, by kissing, sneezing, or\nother transfer of fluids. Freshers are\nespecially susceptible, as they are\naway from home, and so\nencounter germs that they have\nnot come into contact with before.\nThis mingled with the traditional\nstudent life means that the incidence of meningitis in halls of residence is three times that of the rest\nof the population.\nNo student is known to have\nhad meningitis at Imperial.\nStudents are advised to watch the\nhealth of those around them,\nthough, and to be aware of the\nsymptoms, which initially resemble\n'flu, followed by fever, a stiff neck,\nsevere headache, dislike of bright\nlights, vomiting, drowsiness, or\neven coma. A rash can also be present in advanced cases, due to sep-tice mia, poisoning of the blood by\nthe bacteria. Should you or a friend\nbegin to suffer flu-like symptoms,\nAncillia Whittingdale, a practice\nnurse at the IC Health Centre advises that students try traditional\ntreatments such as paracetamol or\naspirin, and to tell a friend to keep\nan eye on them. If symptoms\nbecome worse, to see a doctor or\nnurse. The heath centre runs open\nclinics every morning, which do not\nrequire an appointment. She also\nstressed that any appearance of a rash, that starts looking like \"pin\npricks under the skin\" and progresses to look like a bruise and does not\ndisappear with pressure can be an\nindication of very advanced meningitis.

It is, as the blurb suggests,\nexactly like being in a Star Wars\nmovie, with well directed FMV and\nspectacular 3D animation cut-scenes, merging tightly with the\naction.\nYou are the rebel Rookie One,\nand as always, it is down to you to\nstop the Empire from destroying\nthe Rebels, uncover their new\nsecret weapon, etc. The story is\nwell put together and has a few\nmoments of real Lucas magic. A healthy sense of san it is ed but well\nobserved humour keeps the spirit\nof Star Wars going, and it feels like\na real page turner. Unfortunately,\nthe pages are the levels and the\nlevels do not change a great deal.\nSpace battles take place in a heavy\nhanded walk through fashion, and\nyou are clawing at the joystick for a bit of freedom. Ground combat is\nsimilarly limited, although you are\n31 October 1997\nable to dive in and out of cover in\naddition to aiming and firing at the\nincredibly stupid stormtroopers.\nThe behind-the-ship perspective,\nused for flying down mine shafts, through trees on speeder bikes and\nthrough canyons on training missions is just a little too jerky. To be\nfair, Lucas Arts have dressed each\nlevel up very nicely, and at first you\ndon't notice how simplistic everything is, but after an hour or so of\nplay you just want to get on to the\nnext bit of plot, and the gameplay\nbecomes a hindrance.\nOnce the game has been com-ple ted, there is no incentive to\nreturn, and the lack of network\noptions will soon consign this to\nthe back of the drawer. All that\nsaid, it is a very slick, well made\nand absorbing game, which, if\nyou've not seen before, is well\nworth a look at budget price. You\nmay do better merely to borrow a copy for the evening though. H Mr Trout\nGRAND THEFT AUTO PANDEMONIUM 2\nDMA Design Ltd Crystal Dynamics\nAt last!

Take control of dozens of different vehicles,\nfrom the mundane to the meaty, each with distinctive handling and its\nown radio and horn for noise noise noise, boys.\nThree vast and very different 'living' city networks are waiting to be\nexplored - and exploited. Speed recklessly down the main streets, free-ways, alleyways, back streets and pavements, through parks and shopping malls (and pedestrians if need be) to reach your destination - or\nescape the long arm of the law.\nRace, chase, skid and wheel spin; burn that rubber; smash, bash, crash\nand trash those cars;\nbump and jump; break\nthrough roadblocks;\nrack up the body count and your score, for\nthe only way to beat\nthe law is to drive without due care and\nattention (bribery can\nhelp, but the price is\nhigh).

To vote, you need your Union Card. If you\nhaven't got one yet, go to the Union Office with your registration document an a couple of photos (of yourself).\nWhoever wins these elections will be representing you\nand your union all year, so no lame excuses, get involved and\nUSE YOUR VOTE.\nThis change is good. Good for ICU and good for the\nConstituent College Unions, as it provides the perfect opportunity for us to get what we, as a collective whole student body,\nneed. However, this can only be done if we put dogma and previous disagreements behind us. Fresh momentum, fresh ideas\nand fresh initiatives can unite the student body against the useless bureaucracy that exists within Sherfield, and get results.\nThese fresh ideas will not come from any old 'Union hack'.\nThe strength of ICU that currently exists needs a fresh face to\nprovide strong leadership and prepare the Union for the many\ntough decisions that lie ahead. A new broom is required to\nsweep the cobwebs away, and to concentrate the work of ICU\nin the areas where you want it to be directed, not where a clique of CV-tillers think it would be best placed. ICU should be\ninclusive, not exclusive, and provide a service, not prove to be\na hindrance.\nAs President, 1 will make it my priority to ensure that ICU\nprovides you with the services you want.

Feeder\ncalling!\nAlthough this debut album was\nonly released a couple of months\nago, the recent success of the single High has prompted the release\nof this so-called 'enhanced' version\n- they've basically remixed the first\ntrack and added the song and (CD-Rom accessible) video of High.\nQuite why they felt the need I know not as this is a bloody good\nalbum even without the additions.\nFeeder display good pop sensibilities with some killer hooks yet\nfor a3 piece they have a very thick\nguitar sound and can be amazingly\nheavy when they need to be, yet\nstill know how to play quietly creating good dynamical tension.\nAll of the songs are good and\nit's actually quite hard to pick\nstand-out tracks on an album of\nsuch consistent high quality but my\nfavourites include Descend (a maz ing build up of tension before\nexploding), Stereo World (amazing\nopening), the quieter Forgive and\nthe superlative My Perfect Day\nwhich has an insanely catchy, driving riff from their Japanese\nbassist.\nIf you like music towards the\nharder end of Indie then this album\nis a must - it ROCKS with some\ngenuinely catchy and enjoyable\nsongs. One of the debut albums of\nthe year in my opinion - go buy! CI\nMartin\nF or those of you who do not\nknow much about early seventies pornographic 'vampire'\nfilms, Vampyros Lesbos is a veritable queen. Originally produced by\nJesse Franco in 1970 (along with\ntwo others in the same vein, so to\nspeak) the stories follow the\nseductive Countess Nadine, played\nby Soledad Miranda - who tragically died a year after the films'\nrelease at the tender age of 27 - as\nshe hy p not is es young German\nblondes and tricks them into coming to her castle somewhere off\nTurkey, where she has her wicked\nway with them. In amongst the\nrather tame and often hilariously\ndrawn out sex scenes the soundtracks of Manfred Hubner and\nSiegfried Schwab spread their eerie\nwings and truly fly. Grinding ham-mon d, belting horns and the\ninevitable wailing sitar all find their\nplace in a stew of hyper-easy\nmelody bubbling away in a darker,\nrhythm a tic cauldron.\nRecently made available on the\nexcellent label 'Crippled Dick Hot\nWax', Vampyros Lesbos-Sexadelic\nDance Party has been tortured by\ntwo years of pain-st a kingly executed remixing - right down to the\nbare bones of it's blue vinyl press-ing. This has produced The Spirit of\nVampyros and features an assortment of serious dabblers in black-magic sampling. Anyone who has\nseen the film (and it is out on general release on 'Crippled Dick\nHot Wax') will expect some fine\ndialogue breaks and here they are -cast like a spell over what is top\nnotch breakbeat madness.\nOpening with enough tempo just\nto get you in the mood, it's not\nlong before track two kicks it wild\nwith the start of Necronomania\n(lifted from the track on the original\nsoundtrack), turning it into tuff\ndrum and bass with a real chase-scene feel to it. The tracks sink\ntheir teeth one into the next and\nby track 9 some seriously dark\nbleeps and beats have begun drawing blood - this is not head nodding\nmusic; huge fuzzy bass and\nr ever bed out Fender Rhodes all\nlend their weight to an album that\nrocks - buy it!! H James G SINGLES\nBush - Bonedriven\nThey're big in America, but so are the Ku Klux\nKlan and this single is about as appealing.\nEarl Brutus - The SAS and the glam that goes\nwith it\nCrazy name, fairly indifferent song. Certainly\nnot bad, but not a patch on the cardiac s who\nthey are trying so hard to be.\nDepeche Mode - Useless\nThis single includes a remix by Barry Adamson\nand rather a neat CD ROM video of the previous\nsingle Barrel of a Cun. However, you can't get\naway from the fact that they still sound the\nsame as they did seven years ago.\nAlabama 3 - Speed of the Sound of Loneliness\nI 've been assured that this sounds like the\nNotting Hillbillies with synthesisers. Sadly,\nthey're not very good.\nLil Louis and the Party - Clap Your Hands\nUnspeakably bad whiny crap. I stuck it in the\nmicro ave which was quite fun, but it her than\nthat I can see e no earthly reason to purchase\nthis.\nThe Karelia - Love's a Cliche\nThis is actually really quite good. It is refreshingly free from p retention s of profundity and is\ndef n it ely worth listening to.\nJacob\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON S The Charlatans - Tellin' Stories\nThe title track from the Charlies' last album\nkeeps up the high calibre of singles they have\nreleased this year. The singing is whiny but cool\nand the music is, as always, very cool.\nMoby - James Bond Theme\nIn the 1960s, John Barry was asked to write a tune for a film for which he had not seen. Now,\nMoby brings it into the 90s with the help of a drum machine and some wicked samples. Both\nare brilliant snapshots of their times - listen to\nthe original and this one back to back and you\ncan truly appreciate how music has changed\nover the years.\nNatalie Imbruglia - Torn\nDo you remember Beth from Neighbours? You\nknow, the one with shoulder-length brown hair\nwho married Brad? Well, she's started to sing.\nTorn is catchy and stays on the right side of the\nwhole woman-with-angst thing that seems so\npopular these days. Cool.\nAsh - A Life Less Ordinary\nThis is the title song to that new Ewan\nMacgregor film but you probably all know that.\nIt is so like Ash it's untrue but at least it maintains some hope that they will get better one\nday since it has little of the pre-pubescent lyrics\nthey usually come up with. Thinking about it, it\nreminds me of Goldfinger.\nBlack Crape - Get Higher\nIt's taken long enough for Shaun and company\nto get their act together and this is a little disappointing frankly. It has none of the spice that\nfilled their last album to the point of turning it\ninto av in da loo but it is Black Grape and it has\nbeen a long time... CI\nAlok\n\n"

    "content": "24 October 1997 COLUMNS\nFew of you will have heard of the\nname of Charlie Whelan. This is\nhow he would like it: he is one of\nLabour's 'men in the shadows' -liaising with the press, ensuring the\n'right' kind of stories come through.\nThis failed spectacularly last\nweek, when shares fell sharply with\nthe news that the Government was\nnot going into economic monetary\nunion (EMU) - the single currency -for the near future, having said last\nweek that it would. It then transpired that there was a rift between\nNumber 10 and the Treasury as to\nwhat was really going on. The\nChancellor, Gordon Brown, then\nhad to keep an old engagement\nand was seen addressing the Stock\nExchange in front of a video screen\nwith a sea of red numbers, representing billions of pounds being\nwiped off share values.\nSo how had this all come\nabout? The thorny question of EMU\nhelped in the downfall of the last\ngovernment, and the present one\nhad little better idea of how to deal\nwith it. No firm election pledge had\nbeen made. Against this backdrop\nwere the two powerful personal i ties, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.\nThey both cultivate a 'nice guy'\nimage, rather essential in politics.\nHowever someone needs to do\ntheir dirty work for them, and in the\ncase of Brown it is Charlie Whelan.\nHe is from the old school of press\nliaison, plenty of beer and colourful\nlanguage. He had come into the\nTreasury with Gordon Brown, soon\nin the confines of Number 10,\nwhere he could be kept an eye on.\nBrown refused point blank -Whelan was a vital asset as his personal 'boot-boy' the Mr Nasty to his\nMr Nice.\nThe other personality on the\nscene was Peter Mandelson.\nWhelan and Mandelson openly\ndespise each other, with Whelan\nholding no loyalty to Blair.\n: / Hamish Common Westminster\nEye\nhounding out Jill Rutter, the previous Treasury press secretary, precipitating the comment that a senior civil servant had to make\nway for an 'imported hooligan'. Just\nbeforehand, Tony Blair, mindful of\nthe trouble that this loose cannon\ncould cause, demanded that\nWhelan be sacked or brought with-Mandelson had spent so much\ntime worrying about affairs such as\nhis Millennium Dome and who was\nin charge when Blair was away, that\nhe (and others) had forgotten\nabout the tiny matter of Europe.\nLabour is still split on the single currency issue, and although dissenters haven't been as vocal as\nwith the Conservatives, it\nhas been bubbling away\nbelow the surface. When\none drops the PM and the\nChancellor, plus their respective\nshifty sidekicks into the fray it was-n't too surprising that it could erupt\nin the way it did. Whelan had\nbriefed the press quietly in a Whitehall pub (so local lore has it)\nthat the Government was going\ninto the single currency - shares\njumped and the pound fell - then\nlater news came that we weren't actually going into it, and then we\ndidn't really know, and for a while\nBlair and Brown started giving different signals as to the state of\naffairs. The press saw the story and\ngrabbed it, with plenty of column\ninches about shadowy spin-doc-tors, stockbrokers heckling the\nPrime Minister, splits, Europe, and\nmore \"Reasons why we must never\njoin the Single Currency\". All in all\nappallingly bad press for the\nGovernment; by admission their\nworst week so far.\nM LTL TD;..... Pumpkin Mania\nThe time is upon is when thousands of pumpkins are sold on\nthe cheap, hollowed out, cut\nup into scary (not) faces and\nfinally chucked in the bin. This\nis a horrendous and disgraceful\nwaste of one of the tastiest\nautumn fruits. My mission this\nweek is to show you how to\nturn a piece of decor into two\nof the most superb orally\ningested taste bud exploding\nexperiences ever - pumpkin\nsoup and pumpkin pie.\nThe soup is simple. Take 1\npart waxy potatoes and 2 parts\npumpkin and cut them up into\nVz inch cubes. Over a fierce\nheat, toss the pumpkin with\nlots of butter until some of it\nhas browned. Add a pinch of\nnutmeg, a pinch of ground\npepper and a couple of cloves\nand let them heat through.\nThen add the potatoes, a generous pinch of salt, cover with\nwater and bring to the boil. This\nall needs to simmer for about\nVi hour after which a quick\nbz zzz in a food processor or a thorough massacring with a potato masher and voila, bon\nap petit( note correct spelling).\nThe pie is more complex. You\nwill need:\n* 1 lb pulped pumpkin. You\nmake this by cutting up the\npumpkin into chunks, cooking\nit in a low oven for 45mn1 hr,\npressing between two plates to\nremove as much water as possible and then bz zzz or\nAhhhhhhh as with the soup.\n2 large/3 medium eggs.\n*' 3oz Demerara or Muscovado sugar, the darker the better.\n\u00ab\u2022 4 t bl Golden Syrup.\n1 '/z tsp ground cinnamon.\n<*\" 1 tsp ground ginger.\n\u00ab\" A tsp ground cloves.\n\u00ae- 'A tsp salt.\n\u00bb\" 80-100 ml double cream.\n\"~ Enough shortcrust pastry\nfor a25cm round tart tin. **\nsr 25cm round tart tin (ideal\nbut more or less any other\noven tin will do).\nPreheat the oven to 190\u00b0C( Gas mark 5-6). Roll out your\npastry to the appropriate\nshape (use a bottle, there's nothing better) and line the\n(heavily greased) tin. In a large\nbowl mix all the other ingredients thoroughly with a large\nfork or whisk or b zzz zz it in\nyour favourite kitchen motor. It\nshould end up frothy and light\ndespite the high specific calorie capacity. Combine the parts\nby pouring the slop into the tin\nand place in the oven for 45\nminutes or until set firm. Eat\ncool, do NOT add cream or\nyour liver will break down.\n** Making the pastry is a bit tricky. Take 225g of whole-meal flour and 150g very cold\nbutter. Chop the butter into\nsmallest pieces you possibly\ncan and add to the flour. At\nthis point I usually put the lot\ninto the freezer for A hour\nthen with a fork, crush the butter and flour together. The\n(un achievable) aim is to cover\nevery grain of flour in butter\nwithout melting it. Once your\nbored of this, add one egg yolk\nand 2-3 tablespoons of chilled\nwater and mix gently. Carry on\nadding water until the dough is\nsupple but not sticky. Now\nplace the dough in the fridge\nfor a couple of hours before\nrolling out (about 3-4mm thick).\nAntoine\n\n"

In one of\nthe first moves of the game, Rich\n\"Mongol\" Lloyd burst through the\nQ MW defence to score a try which\nmotivated the team for the rest of\nthe first half. The main fault in the\nperformance was a shortage in\nline-out possession but good\ninterplay and support in midfield\nmade up for that. An excellent\nindividual effort led to a try from\nwinger Jim \"Squeaky\" Sopper (Man\nof the match).\nIn the second half, after a short\nperiod when the team composed\nthemselves, more fluid rugby fol-lowed.

St Barts fell to pieces as\nIC poured on relentless pressure.\nThe result was, to be honest ajam my escape.\nICHC II 1 - 0 St Bart'sI On Wednesday, the best RSM\nteam for years faced ICI11. RSM\nopened the scoring in the second\nhalf after constant pressure. Tim's hit at goal and a deflection saw the\nball into the back of the net,\nwatched by his girlfriend. ICI Us\npulled back with a fine goal ten\nminutes later, but RSM then dominated the rest of the game with\ntwo goals - first from Maruf and\nthen Shiman sealing it with a fine\nreverse-stick hit.\nRSM 3 - 1 ICHC 1\n1\n1\nICWHC Iv KCL\nA good performance against a renamed side. The score line does\nnot reflect the effort displayed.\nIntense hockey resulted in two\ninjuries. The first a woos ie Kings\ngirl who nearly cracked her skull\nopen then Hummingbird who fell\nover Somebody's shoe! By the end\nof the match there were more\nambulances than goals. And then\nwe beat the boys at singing!\nICWHC I00 KCL\nAfter a good season last year for\nthe men's team, first in the third\ndivision table and qualifying to the\nLondon League Division II, their\nstart for this season could not be\nbetter, three wins in row.\nFirst match was against LSE in\nthe BUSA championship, where IC\nboys taught the opposition a lesson on away ground. The next two\nmatches were in the London\nLeague, against IVA Boustan and\nAnatolia VC . IC boys were against\ntough opposition but came back to\nwin both matches after losing the\nfirst set on both occasions.\nWe have three teams for the\nfirst time: men's, women's and the\nmixed team. We train on Fridays\nevenings between 6 and 8pm, and\nin the first two terms we invite\nbeginners to join us on\nWednesdays afternoons 3-5pm in\nthe sports centre. We meet an\nhour before training at the cash\nmachine in the Sherfield Building.\nICVC 3- 0 LSE\nICVC 3 - 1 IVA Boustan\nICVC 3 - 1 Anatolia\n\n"

    "content": "31 October 1997\nEXHIBITION\nCLOSER\nRoyal National Theatre\nARTS 21\nLiza Walker as\nAlice smoking a fag.\nW hat do you expect to\nexperience at the\nNational Theatre? A per-fon nance of high standard? Yes.\nSmooth swift and clever pro duc tion? Certainly. Confident professional acting? Definitely. 'Closer',\nPatrick Marber's new play certainly\nhas all of these. However, c la in ung that it might be a production to\nprovoke, challenge, shock or experience would be like trying to compare 'Neighbours' to 'Cracker' -somehow 1 don't think so. Don't get me wrong, 'Closer' is entertain-ing, sometimes extremely flinn y, others quaintly moving, but what it\nachieves in entertainment in lacks\nin reality and emotion.\nThe simplicity of the staging is\nwonder fill. The fist scene, set in a hospital requires only three chairs\nand a bin, while the cold towering\nwalls on the side and back (which\nremain throughout the per fon nance) are kept on the edges of the\ndark volume of the wings by the\nsimply lit, raised staged.\nWe meet 'Alice', Liza Walker, a stripper just returned from New\nYork who apparently, \"knows what\nmen want ... they want women to\ncome like \u2014 but elegantly.\" 1 She\nhas just been knocked over by a cab occupied by 'Dan' played by\nMark Strong. Their relationship\nbegins, but by only the next scene,\nset some months later, we are\ngiven a glimpse of Dan's 'male'\nnature - a sad indication of the fickle twists that develop later.\nBy far the fim nie st scene fol-lows, wherein no more than ten\nwords are spoken. Dan now an\nup eo ming author of a book based\non Alice's life, leads a doctor,\n'Larry' played by Neil Dudgeon,\ninto a cyber-sex chat on the\nInternet \u2014an pretending to be a girl!). The remarkable witty script,\nsuperb timing and the effects used\nlead the audience to one of the\nsmoothest and most enjoyable\nparts of the evening. It shows quite\nclearly how the characters themselves fail to connect with the audience when we are forced to listen\nto their 'human' emotions.\nLarry eventually pairs up with\n'Anna' a photographer played by\nSally Dexter, before the f mal scene\nof the first act where we witness\nthe breaking up of both couples-Dan is apparently in love with Anna.\nThe clever staging allows us to see\nit hap pe in ng both at the same\ntime, agra tef lil respite to the long\nand unconvincing sexual details we\nare pulled through - or maybe just\na hint of the seer a ingly endless\nsimilar situations we see later.\nIndeed the second act begins in\na strip joint. If, however, every strip\njoint were as un arousing or une rot ic as this then they'd have to find a new property development plan for\nSoho. The atmosphere isn't helped\nby the fact that it now seems Larry\nand Alice, who is dancing at the\nclub, are going to get together. The\nrest of the second act just seems to\nbe littered with events of partner\nswapping, vengeance, and witty\nremarks about men (some of which\n- it has to be admitted - are\nextremely flinn y). The intriguing idea of leaving\nthe props and set of previous\nscenes at the back and sides of the\nstage seems to reflect the cluttered\nlives the characters weave for\nthemselves. (Though I'm tempted\nto believe it reflects the cluttered\nrn in d of Marber when he thought of\na plot.)\nThe sad, somewhat downbeat\nending is lost, as we've never really\nbeen allowed to connect with the\ncharacter's emotions. Despite\nMarbers claim that, \"Closer is an\nintimate play, but that doesn't mean, necessarily, that it is best\nexperienced close up\", I'd love to\nsee it with some of the restrictions\nof smaller or fringe productions.\nIn the play the book written by\nDan has appeal, because it was\nhonest and true -something which\nwas missing from this entertaining\nand professional attempt at a \"comedy of our time\". H Matt Williams\nCARL AND KARIN LARSSON : CREATORS OF THE SWEDISH STYLE\nV&AT his exhibition, the first of that importance,\never to be held outside Sweden, celebrates the work of Carl and Karin Larsson\nand its fantastic influence on Swedish and international design for more than 100 years.\nCarl Larsson is Sweden's most popular and\nacclaimed artist. Together with his wife, he created an innovative style in interior design, which\nwas soon to become the essence of what we\nnow call \"the Swedish style\" : simple, luminous\nand colourful, practical, comfortable and robust\n; radically differentiating itself from the dark,\nheavy and pompous trends of the 19th century.\nThe Larssons were part of a Swedish artistic\nmovement of the 1890s which showed a renewed interest for the homelands, native dis-tr ict s, local folklore and remote areas. To this\nstrong inspirational source was added a blend of\nvaried influences comprising Art Nouveau,\nItalian Renaissance, English Arts and Crafts and\nthe Japanese style.( Larsson even confessed\nthat \"as an artist, Japan was his homeland\".)\nNot only did the Larssons introduce a style\nin design, but also promoted a lifestyle, unpretentious, rural and family centred, which they\ndeveloped and pursued in their famous\nSundborn Cottage. The home became the centre point of Carl's and Karin's global approach to\ndesign, extending their ideas and creations to ail\nof its minute details, from woven fabrics, flower\narrangement to wall decorations and furniture.\nThe exhibition presents a large collection of\nwater-colours, amongst which Carl's most\nfamous scenes can be found, reproduced\nthroughout the world, as well as oils, drawings\nand photographs. There is an important focus\non Sundborn house, through several re-installations of rooms, including original furniture.\nCarl's pictures, in their \"elaborate sim pl ici ty\", are a celebration of the family and show the\nremarkable intensity of the links which united\nhim to each of its members. As he expressed it\nhimself: \"They are a very genuine expression of\nmy personality, of my deepest feelings, of all my\nlimitless love for my wife and children.\" Even\nwhen they do not appear 'in person', they still\nbelong to the picture by some sign from the\nartist. One very often finds representations of\ntoys and Carl himself regularly appears as his\n\"alter-ego clown\".\nThe artist's attachment to tradition is also\nshown through various representations of typical celebrations.\nThe exhibition also treats the unique legacy\nof the artists, in its last part, \" A100 years of the\nLarssons' ideal\" which focuses on that astound-ing, seemingly unwavering influence. Carl's water-colours have been used extensively in\nadvertisement as an appreciated symbol of fam-i ly, happiness and security. Their design concept\nhas inspired many of the country's leading\ndesigners and architects and has spread across\nthe world, through successful Swedish firms\nsuch as IKEA, main sponsor of the exhibition,\npaying a tribute to those who \"in spirited them\".\nSuch has become the inseparability of the\nSwedish society from the Larssons, that the new\nSwedish passport will, from January 98, show\none of the artist's paintings in its inner cover.\nThe Karin and Carl Larsson exhibition is really one not to be missed. Putting aside all artist i cal, historical and conceptual reflection, it is, in\nthe spirits of the artists themselves, \"simply\"\npleasant, fj\nDanuta\n\n"

Co down\nthe bar, have a few pints, and talk\na great deal actually.\nJohnny Ball: Oh, are we going\ndown the ian e here? 1 know it.\nJon Trout: You know Southside\nBar?\nBall: Yeah, you know the thing in\nMarch [Baysday] that's always full\nof thirteen year old girls. Here,\nevery year, we've done it for the\nlast four years.\n[They buy a pint]\nTrout: So - you've been to Africa\nwith Oxfam then .What are they up\nto out there?\nBall: Well, a lot of people think of\nOxfam as an emergency response,\nbut in actual fact they are working\nin over seventy countries per pet u ally. Even places like North Korea\nwhere Westerners are just not\nallowed under any conditions -we've got [somebody] in there\nworking under cover.\nLast year, Oxfam spent 76 million\nquid in foreign countries which\nworks out at about a million a country, which isn't very much. Yet\noverall, it's low-tech requirements\nthat the people need. They don't need tractors and stuff because\nyou can only give those to a percentage of farmers and they get\nembarrassing. They want low tech\nstuff and they want support - the\nunderstanding of how they can do\nit for themselves.\nThey also work in co-operation\nwith the countries - they don't go\n\"Look, we're Oxfam, we know how\nit works, here you are.\"\nTrout: Can you tell me how a clockwork radio works?\nBall: Yes [laughs] I'm all for something like that. It winds, and then it\nproduces... Well, I'm not sure. I think it's a sort of Piezo-electric\neffect that builds up an electric\ncharge that runs the radio. Radios\ndon't need a lot of electricity.\nThey're all made in Soweto.\n[They are interrupted and bought\ndrinks]\nBall: I met Baylis [who invented\nthe clockwork radio], actually, two\nweeks ago. The \u00a310 ones, which\nare quite small and have solar panels along the top, have a small\ncrank which is a bit weak and in my\ncase, it broke so we mended it\nwith a knife, a straight cutlery\nknife, and it works very well. They\nnow produce much bigger ones,\nwhich are a foot long and quite\nbulbous - great things for carrying\non your shoulder like ghetto-blasters. They're \u00a335 to the aid\nagencies, but you can buy them\nyourself though they cost more.\nThey took the solar panels off and\nput short-wave in. Now, I don't think the Africans need short-wave\nso much, they're much happier to\ntune it to local services, that's where it's important.\nTrout: What would you say the\nmain uses of things like the clock-\"Why do the bubbles go down in a pint of stout?\nI'm glad you asked...\" Photo: Ivan\nwork radio are in Africa? Obviously\ncommunication's important, but is\nit entertainment, education..?\nBall: Well, what Oxfam are also\ndoing is setting up radio stations -solar powered radio stations - that\n...WELL, I'M NOT\nSURE. I THINK IT'S A SORT OF PIEZOELECTRIC EFFECT.\nare very cheap to install and main-tain. They cover a wide area, they\nreally are very adequate and they\nget staff who speak all the local\nlanguages. They find that the fellows are quite excited by them - in\nMali the rule is \"No politics or religion on the radio\" and that's all -the only restrictions which is great.\nImagine the British media without\npolitics! After a while, they found\nthat the demands for new programs are mostly from women,\nand I 've got this great feeling that\nthe emancipation of women in the\nthird world will really bring them on\nmuch quicker than anything else.\nWith religious taboos they move so\nslowly. But the women demand\nthe programs - about AIDS, about\nchild birth, im munis ation and all\nkinds of things.\nTrout: I want to side-track a little\nbit and go to your academic\ncareer. 1 remember covering,\nabout two years ago a story with\nRichard Wilson involved. Do you\nwant to talk a bit about that?\nBall: When I was Rector of\nGlasgow University? I really\nworked hard. Within two months\nof becoming the rector, with the\nhelp of students we re-channelled\nfive million quid into sports facilities at Glasgow and they've got the\nbest sports hall in the country.\nTowards the end, it was getting\nclose to between nine and thirteen\nmillion for more facilities to make\n31 October 1997 FEATURE 13\n\u00ab\nlonnie s our of British science,\nTrout in Southside...\nGlasgow more appealing internationally - something to boast about\n- so I wanted to do another term. I stood on an apolitical platform\nwith no political affiliations.\nTrout: But Richard Wilson certainly does have affiliations...\nBall: He's rather left, you know, a bit left of Ghengis Khan. But he got\nin, and the sad thing was, when I arrived on the election day, 1\ncouldn't do any of the hustling and\n1 found that my name had been\ndragged in the mud - things that\nwere totally untrue. The Socialist\nWorker were everywhere, but suddenly disappeared at eleven\no 'clock. So obviously there was a directive. They were giving the\nwrong impression there which was\nterribly sad because I'd really been\napolitical and I had really helped\npeople. Even the SOC that was in,\nI'd helped them change their voting system so it was easier, people\nwho really wanted a job could get\na job. I'd pegged student rent\nincreases for two years down to\n6%, which was the overall increase\nof all universities, when they were\ntrying to stack 12- 13% on.\nAnyway, I won on the first vote\nwith 49%, and the second, the\nreappraisal of votes, went his way\n- I mean it really was fifty-fifty. If\nhe works, it's all right, but it was\nset up.\nRICHARD WILSON'S RATHER LEFT YOU\nKNOW A BIT LEFT\nOF GHENGIS\nKHAN.\nTrout: Do you know anything\nabout what he is doing?\nBall: Eh...yeah (laughs)\nTrout: You don't want to talk\nabout it?\nBall: Some good, some bad, not\nparticularly.\nTrout: OK, moving on...what's your favourite experiment ever?\nBall: Well I 've got one now where\nI fire a flame about three metres\nover people's heads, so it's just\nthe latest one. I 've got an expanding do dec a icosahedron trick...\nTrout: Yeah, I 've seen that one...\nBall: ...but I can't find anywhere\nthat retails them in this country. So\nthat's a new toy. I 've also got a Tesla coil that's about three foot\nsix high which produces a spark\ninterests you?\nBall: There's all kinds of things, like\nnow they're saying that pets are a causing a build-up of C02 in the\natmosphere, which is impossible.\nIt's like saying there are more jugglers at Covent Garden so there's a build-up of Indian clubs and balls\nin the atmosphere \u2014 they come\ndown again. C02 won't stay up\nthere: it's heavier than air, and\nwhen it comes down it grows grass\nand plants. So you can have more\nC02 going through the at mos Johnny does his Thunderbirds impression\nduring a lecture, to great applause\nPhoto: Ivan\nabout a foot long, and that'll light\nup two fluorescent lightbulbs held\nat arms length by someone. So... 1\njust have lots of toys!\nTrout: I 've been asking everyone\n\"I'm meeting Johnny Ball, what\nshould I ask him?\", and they've all\nbeen saying \"Ask about Zoe!\". And\nI say \"No, I'm not asking about\nher\".\nBall: Well she's my daughter, I'm not her father...I mean I am, but\nyou know what I mean [laughs].\nTrout: In science at the moment,\nis there anything in particular that\np here. They did a lovely experiment recently on pollution in the\natmosphere in terms of people's lungs, but they tried to refute it\nbecause it went the wrong way.\nThey had a cyclist and a motorist\ngoing across London, finishing up\nin Oxford Street. They got to the\nend, and they found the motorist\nhad slightly dirtier lungs than the\ncyclist, because the cyclist had\nbeen doing reasonable exercise\nand his lungs were quite capable of\nsucking anything in and pumping it\nall back out again except the oxy-gen. So we do panic, and we do let\nthe media panic us. It's quite\nfrightening. The world's going\ngreen, even the multinationals -they're slow about it, but they've\ngot to do it. That's another thing:\nyou don't need Greenpeace if\nthey're going to be dishonest - and\nthey are, they're bloody dishonest.\nIf they recruit radicals who are hell-bent on revolution rather than\nchange by coercion, it just causes\ntrouble and messes the whole\nthing up. With honesty they've got\nsuch a good case, they could win\nanywhere.\nTrout: The editor of New Scientist\nsaid that you were the main reason\nBritish schoolchildren were interested in science. How does that\naffect you?\nBall: The sad thing is that television treated me so badly, with\nsuch disrespect, that I don't offer\nideas for programmes for television because I don't understand\ntheir politics and motivation. Other\nthan that it's lovely.\nTrout: Do you get people coming\nup to you in the street and asking\nyou \"Do you know how this\nworks?\"\nBall: Yes, and I used to say \"No\"\n(laughs).\nTrout: Because I was under the\nimpression for quite a while that\nthere was nothing that you didn't know.\nTrout: OK, I 'll leave it at that.\nThanks.\nJon Trout\n\n"

    "content": "26 FICTION 31 st October 1997\nThe Man With The Ten Bob Note\nA story by Buz Barstow\nA solitary death is so unkind to us\nall. It leaves us in that instant of\nindignity where all that there can\nbe are preconceptions about what\nwe did, where we came from, all\nbased on what remains with us,\nwhen we were in no state of mind\nto choose wisely.\n)ust, then imagine, what it is like\nfor those with no means of pre para tion, living each day as it comes,\nwith no desire but for the end, but\nno idea about how to meet it. Stuck\nin the singularity between action\nand indecision.\nSo, when you're found dead in a park. Your death bed was made of\nroses, your funeral gown a long,\ncoarse coat, shoes battered beyond\nrepair, days of growth on your beard\nand an Eisenhower cap, the indignity must be hard to bear, but I suppose no harder than the pity heaped\nupon you everyday. You're lucky\nyou're dead.\nThe impression you leave on the\nuniverse in the instant of death, is\nfor a tramp, the most important\none, and almost uncertainly, the\nmost unfavourable. Everything you\never amounted to during your life,\neverything you achieved is erased,\nnever really was, as without ident if i cation, your life lacks closure. You\ncannot be remembered for what you\ndid, as no one knows you need to\nbe remembered. All the closure you\nwill receive is the impression your\nbody, your clothing and the means\nof your death gives of you.\nThe clues are limitless, if only\nyou have the eyes to look. The silver\nring, shining in the light of the sun\nagainst the mans darkened hands.\nStill, no, moving, why is it moving?\nTumbling against the blackness,\nmore of them, ten, a hundred, a thousand, so many that they begin\nto bring meaning to the blackness.\nBut still moving, the original had\nlong since passed out of view. Yet\nthey continued falling. Out in front\nof the blackness was an impression,\nlines of a face, the tramps face, but\nyounger, the features were stronger,\neyes filled with brightness. Now it all\nbegins to become clear who the\nman was. He was out amongst the\nstars.\nThe man lifted himself off his\nknees. The stars never lost their\nwonder did they? However much\ntime you spent out in their realm.\nLike so many onboard, the man was\nborn on a planetary body. Some\nsaid that even being born in space\ndidn't diminish the wonder of the\nstars. The wonder of the stars,\ndespite their brilliance, wasn't the\nmans main concern, more one in\nparticular, or to be precise, a planet\nsurrounding it.\nThe star system that his starship\norbited so carefully, was a dual s ys tem, composed of a black hole,\norbited by a red giant about which\norbited what remained of the planets it had ravaged by the expansion\nof its atmosphere.\nAs the red giant orbited the\nblack hole, it gradually spiralled ever\ncloser, and one day it would enter\nthe black hole, and, for all intents\nand purposes leave our universe,\nbut long before that day, tidal forces\nexerted on the star and planets by\nthe black hole would reduce them to\na platter of rubble and plasma. That\nday was coming sooner than anyone\nliked. One of the remaining gas\ngiants in the system held a moon in\nits a grip, on which remained a small\noutpost of the empire. Don't worry,\nnobody was still on it, but there was\nsome house keeping that still needed to be done. If the empire was\nanything, it was fastidious. No stone\nun turned, no file out of place, no\nloose ends. What the housekeeping\nentailed, the man didn't know. He'd be leaving soon, and in 4 days,\nwhen he arrived, he'd be briefed.\nThe sky cracked. Its naked wonder\nwas a rediscovered experience for\nanyone so removed from the organic world. The rain too, whatever it\nmay be made of; ammonia, sulphuric acid, even water, falling on\nthe roof was something you were\nnever able to appreciate in a life in\nspace. There was something about\nthat irregular crackling that was\nuniquely soothing.\nInside what remained of the\noutpost, the man could taste the\nsophistication of the outpost. The\nair was wonderfully moist, but crisp\nat the same time, like tasty fruit, or\nan elegant wine, two more delicacies the man hadn't relished in\nsome time. You'd be surprised what\neffect deprivation had on the soul.\nThe air recycle rs, particularly expensive ones from the taste of the air,\nwere still turned on. The subtle lighting also worked. Another rarity in\nspace.\nThe map of the outpost he'd been given was difficult to follow. It\nwas flat. For someone who'd been\nused to walking around curved tunnels and slipping between variable\ngravity sections, it was more than\njust an interesting challenge, it was\nlike being in the hands of something\nyou didn't quite know or under-stand.\nHis full briefing hadn't yet\narrived, it was supposed to be waiting for him, but waiting where? The\noutposts lounge area was to his\nright, the kitchen to the left. He took\nthe right hand door. All the doors\nhere swung open by hand, another\nluxurious waste of space. Having to\ntake the effort to open every door\nwas a little trying as well.\nHe entered the lounge area. The\nlight from the corridor illuminated a form on the floor. It had a luminescent quality all of its own though, if\nanything diminished by the light\nfrom the corridor. He groped for a light switch around the door. The\nwall lights of the room slowly lit, giving him range of the room, to get to\nthe figure on the floor.\nThe figure was a young woman,\nwho had collapsed on one of the\nglass coffee tables that dotted the\nroom. Must have collapsed in one\nof the last earthquakes and been\nknocked unconscious by the fall.\nHow long had she been like this?\nMore importantly, why was she still\nhere? These were two questions\nthat he'd have to put to the back of\nhis mind until he arrived at the\nmothership. But there lay the pro b lem. The pod he'd used to get here\nonly had enough supplies to take\none back to the mothership.\nThe man carried the woman to\none of the plush red sofas that too\nencircled the room, and took a seat\nhimself. He'd need to sit down to\nmake a decision like this. Hell, he'd need more than that. Leave the\nwoman and save himself, no one\nwould notice. Do the honourable\nthing and sacrifice himself when the\nmoon collapsed under the black\nholes gravitational influence. Or, do\nthe smart thing and take the time to\nconvert the pod to two man travel.\nHe'd have a couple of days at most\nbefore the gas giants orbit took it\nwithin an unsafe distance of the\nblack hole, then the moons structure really would be tested. It would\nalmost undoubtedly fail.\nCommunications with the mothership were out of the question. The\nblack hole not only screwed up\nfaster than light communications by\nplacing an un passable wall in hyper-space, but also made conventional\nradio transmissions impossible.\nThe moon rocked again. Tidal\nforces from the black hole were\nneeding the core of the moon like a baker would do to a piece of dough.\nAt least the end would come soon.\nHe took the woman out through the\numbilical walkway to the pod on the\noutposts landing pad. He told the\nonboard computer to carry out the\nreturn flight path that it had been\ngiven at the mothership to allow it\nto avoid the black hole's event hori-zon. Out of a sense of eternal optimism, he took his EVA suit out of\nthe back of the pod, just in case he\ncould be rescued, and retreated\nback into the outpost, where he\ncommanded the pod to leave the\nmoon and carry out its orders.\nHe went back to the lounge,\npoured himself a selection of what\nremained of the drinks cabinet and\nstarted to wait. Pretty expensive\ntoo. Perhaps this was the housekeeping that needed to be done.\nThe first full day of his incarceration on the moon came, and like\nany man awaiting doom, wasted it,\nwhile simultaneously trying to eke\nout every pleasurable moment. He\ntook little time to appreciate the\nstrange ornaments that adorned the\nbuilding, nor took any to look into\nhis \"housekeeping\".\nFinally, came the end. A long\ntime ago, people would have called\nthis the apocalypse, with no space\nto run to, this really would be the\nend for them. The man had given up\nhis chance to run like a fallen angel.\nThe ground outside started to rip\napart, like most tomes of death said\nit would. The outpost would be hit\nsoon. He donned his EVA suit, like\nany good explorer would, in the vain\nhope that he might be rescued at\nthe last minute, and began to wait\nanew. The outpost was shuddering.\nThe best thing to do would be to\nfind some high ground, above any\nfalling rocks. He climbed to the\nhighest peak available, a laughably\nsmall elevation, and began to survey\nthe destruction. The outpost was\nstill there, barely. He took the time,\nlike he always did when nervous.\nThe sky cracked again. The last thing\nhe remembered was falling.\nTo be continued...\n\n"

This song starts with organs\nsounding not dissimilar to the\nbeginning of Strawberry Fields,\nhowever whilst the Beatles' song\ndevelops into a psychedelic epic,\nthis song turns into a pure uncomplicated pop song. Even though\nthis and indeed all the songs are\nsung in Japanese, the happiness is\nthere for all to hear.\nNot being able to speak\nJapanese, 1 instead checked out\nthe translations of the lyrics and\nfound yet more evidence of the\nlight touch that became apparent.\nThere was no profound sentiment\nor political message to be seen\nanywhere. All the songs were simple love songs and not even\ndoomed love or love gone wrong.\nThe songs were all about the happiness of love and how lovely it all\nis.\nMusically, this is a very inventive album, featuring a wide range\nof electronic effects and the such\nlike. Some of the tracks even feature the sort of high speed drum\nloops usually associated with drum\nand bass and modern dance\nmusic. But whereas this can often\nseem abstract and oppressive,\nPizzicato Five are able to use such\ncutting edge techniques and still\nsound warm and human. They\ndescribe this album as 'Top of the\nPops for the 21st century'. I for\none think that they're right. CI\nChris\n\n"

Compared to\nthe coal fired power station at\nFerrybridge, Yorkshire, which generates 1,200 MW, this may sound\nsmall, but the new station will be\nable to supply the whole of the\nmain site with most of it's electricity and heating needs, including hot\nwater and air conditioning.\nThe new generator will replace\nthe current source of energy which\nconsists of steam imported from\nthe Natural History Museum, electricity from the local power board\nand electricity generated by a heavy oil burning power station\nwhich is located under Elec Eng.\nThe current generator is 30 years\nold and reaching the end of its\nacceptable lifetime. It is also environmentally unfriendly, due to the\nheavy oil it burns, \"...it's like tar,\nyou have to heat it to 80\u00b0C just to\nget it moving\", commented\nAndrew Thome, responsible for\nenergy usage across IC.\nDuring periods of peak\ndemand, top up electricity will be\nimported from the grid, and during\ntimes of low demand College will\nhave the option of selling the\nexcess to the board or reduce the\ngenerating output - much easier\nwith gas-powered stations than\nwith other types.\nWork on the refurbishment will\nstart later this year with the erection of a temporary generator in\nDalby court while the refurbishment\ntakes place. The new power station\nis then planned to be operational\nby Spring/Summer 1999. The cost\nof the new power station will be\naround \u00a36 million, although the\nreturn on investment should mean\nthat the savings on electricity alone\nrepay the investment in ten years.\nCollege has undertaken a number of energy management initiatives over the past few years in\norder to reduce usage. The aim is\nto cut the current \u00a33 million energy\nbudget by 30% over five years.\nOne of the many graduates to recieve their ceremonial nod from\nthe Chairman of the Governors last Thursday. The enormous ceremony took place in the Albert Hall and lasted well over three hours.\n\"At one point, I had to stand up for forty minutes\" one graduate\n_ told us, \"it was pretty boring, but the parents love it.\" Photo: Froggy\nMeasures include the creation of a new energy management section\nwithin College, the fitting of energy\nefficient light bulbs in all student\nbedrooms and new microprocessor\nbased networks which monitor and\ncontrol the operation of ventilation\nand heating throughout buildings.\nThe system, known as BEMS, has\nbeen on trial in the Huxley building\nfor the last two years and has managed to reduce its monthly heating\ndemands by a third.\nEnergy conservation is now of\nprime consideration in all new\nbuildings and refurbishments, and\nis being specifically targeted for further investment. Money has been\nspecifically earmarked for investing\nin energy efficiency over the coming year and formal systems are\nnow in place to review the energy\nefficiency of the whole College.\nJit Patel\n\u2022 . :\u2022 : ' \u2022 . ...\" j THIS WEEK'S NEWS\nMENINGITIS CLAIMS MORE\nSTUDENT LIVES\nThe full story of the formidable dis-ease, and what you can do to\navoid it.\npage two\nCONFERENCE CENTRE WELL\nSHORT OF THE MARK\nLatest figures show that the be ligure d centre is still running at a cross.\npage two\nNEW SECURITY FOR WILSON\nHOUSE\nImproved safety, or expensive Bid\nBrother?\npage three\nBLUNKETT BASHING\nApplications fall as higher education is strangled.\npage three\nThe\nStudents'\nNewspaper\nat Imperial\nCollege\nIssue109631 October1997 "

She has\nbecome some sort of sanity depth\nmarker in the vehicle on this\nunusual evening, but that's another story. Keep moving, keep\nrolling.\nAnd we don't like what we see.\nTHE FENCE is in fact at least two\nfences. It may be more, we can't tell, which makes things worse.\nThere's lights everywhere and\nthese orange metal-mesh boxes\nwith guards in perched every hundred yards. Dark, scary men left\nover from the Third Reich, semiautomatics dangling ominously\nover their fascist hearts and their\nevil eyes staring over glowing cigarettes NO STOP IT there are no\nguns, calm, that's what we need,\ncalm and patience. Calm,\npatience. Yes.\nSure, they want to see our tickets,\nbut they are no match for Ellie.\nEven the zealots, the professional\ncar park attendants, the expert\npetty officials, their motivation\nhas long since osmo sed through\ntheir boots into the all consuming\nmud and as such they were not\nkit ted out deal with Ellie's \"lost little girl - friends are waiting for us\nwith tickets - helpless but sexy\"\nroutine. In short, we were in.\nThe car park, we are into the car\npark. Because you can't drive over\nFENCES.\nAnd so we wander around the\nperimeter. The others have made\na rope ladder with a huge hook\non the end and are very proud. It\nsoon becomes clear that the outer\nFENCE, a wire mesh job with\nspikes on top, is not going to\npose a problem. After this is a concrete FENCE about twelve feet\nhigh, and beyond this we don't know. Near the entrance are arse-holes with ladders charging the\npunters hard earned tenn ers to\nget themselves manhandled by\ndrunken Westcountry thugs\nemployed as security\nguards and discharged\n\u00a3 10 poorer with\nblacker eyes for\nanother go. We keep\non walking.\nThe hook is employed,\nbut the noise in horr en dous, the rusted metal\nscraping on the rough\nconcrete. Shouts from inside:\nFuck Off, but in fewer words,\nif that is possible. We keep on\nwalking. ,\nThis is neat, this is cunning. / ,\nThis takes this piss. Sorry, /\nI 'll go back. We have walked\naround to the hippy stone\ncircle area of the FENCE.\nIt's quieter, and there are\nnone of the blaring arc-lights or security pill-boxes.\nSomebody's disconnected a section of the wire fence and -in a flash of brilliance - has\nlent it against the main con- /y crete FENCE to form a lad\nder.\nWe peek over. There's no\nbody official around, just\nlots of tents. So we sling\nthe rope-ladder into the\nhedge, psyche each other\nup, and go for it.\nAdrenaline, adrenaline, heart\nthumping as we go over the top\nas if we were going to war. All of\nus together over and then a drop\nof twelve foot but no going back.\nEllie drops down onto the mud\nand slips onto her arse, 1 swing\ndown a supporting strut like an\norang-u tang, so high that I 've got\ntunnel vision. We dive off, hurrying between tents and as we flee I realise that the sound in my ears\nis people cheering and it's done\nand we're in and the FENCE will\nnever be anything more than a fence again.\nI made a number of important decisions\nover that Glastonbury weekend. According\nto the law of conservation of misery, some\nwere inevitably more inspired than\nothers. One of the more beneficial\nwas to check the weather forecast\nin the legendary village of\nShepton Mallet, and don my\nthree-quarter army boots rather\nthan my beautiful Airwalk train-ers. One of the slightly\nmore rash decisions was to\nget on the coach in the first\ninstance. In retrospect, I should\nhave sold the ticket and spent the money on\nlarge quantities of beer. I could have seated\nmyself in my nice warm front room and\nwatched the bands pretend to enjoy them-selves.\nThings began to go v rong before we\neven left Liverpool. Being something of a simpleton, I managed to give both my outward and return tickets to the unhelpful\nblok e on the coach, and then staged a heated argument with him in an attempt to get\nmy return ticket back. Quinny, my Glasto\nmuck er, put his head in his hands and\nwhimpered like a dog as he saw his chances\nof getting home dip sharply. The coach party\ndecided that my stupidity was the height of\nhilarity. My weekend began to take shape.\nWhich of you dear readers was in the\nScouts? Fancy yourself as a bit of a tent-erecting a ff ici an a do?I can tell you, putting\nup a tent in gale force winds and driving rain\nis substantially more tricky than performing\nthe same stunt in the temperate zones of the\n13th Allerton Cub Scout Hall. It was cold. It\nwas wet. it was expensive. The food was\nlousy. Bands were cancelled when the second stage sank into the mud. The sun did\nnot come out once. It rained consistently. It\ntook five minutes just to get one's shoes on\nand off. The mud was three feet deep in\nplaces and never more shallow than twelve\ninches. People died. People contracted bacterial infections. People wished it was 1995.\nOn Saturday morning I was awoken by an\nalarm clock devised by Tori Amos, as the\n\"Herbal Highs\" shop across the quagmire\nrepeated her bass loop for the thousandth\ntime. I got up, I struggled out of my tent. It\nwas still cold. It was still wet. I packed up\nand went home.\nWhat a complete waste of time.\nThank God I 've still\ngot some hashish left/'\nTrue stories from those ba\nrain and mud in the middle\nst ions of joy, drugs, love, fields in the\nof fucking nowhere. Compiled by Jon.\n\"1 was on the dodge ms at Tribal Gathering with the\nbiggest joint you ever saw. 1 was shunted from behind\nand it flew out of my mouth to the ground where my\nmate saw some guy pick it up and disappear into the\ncrowd. And it put me on a real downer you know?\nAnyway I came off the dodge ms* and about thirty seconds later someone is tapping on my shoulder. 1 turn\nround and it's this guy handing me back this great carrot\nwith a big grin on his face. He was clearly not sharing the\nconsensus reality. We hugged, shared the rest of it and\nspent about forty minutes talking bollocks about ambient\nmusic. Random acts of kindness like that happen all the\ntime at festivals. Well, ones with drugs, anyway\"\n'Bollocks!\"'Bollqp\nfOL LOCKS!'\" Bollocks!\" Bol lock PFmU\n^\nHow the bloody hell am I supposed to get .

Yet another Blur fan screams \"Wooo-Hooo!\" They have been going for over an hour so far, and\nseem to have lost no ir.te rest. At first I think that it might\nbe a complicated offspring of a \"Drink-While-You-Think\"\nword association game, but the longer it goes on, the more\nI become convinced that it is entirely at random. Which\nwas, admittedly very funny, but noting in comparison to\nwhat happened next. From the tent of my festival comp an ion, Rob, I hear a hustle, a sharp hiss of air, a giggle from\nhis girlfriend and then the unmistakable of the fanfare\nopening of \"2001: A Space Oddessey\". On a kazoo. The\nthin, reedy noise brings silence to the beer y masses.\n\"Dah daa ahh h Dah Ta-Dah\". The longer it\nwent on , the higher the pitch, the more out of tune he\nscreeched, for the funnier it all got. Eventually, the song\nreached its triumphant climax to a truly astonishing round\nof applause, whistling and cheers.\n\"And now, for my next piece, Montegues and Capulets\"\n\"Wooo-Hoooo!\n\"Roger de Courcey!\"\nOh dear.\nYES! SPLAT! YOU'VE BEEN SLIMED! The Casual\nstares around at us angrily looking for a target\nfor his embarrassed wrath. The slurry dribbles\ndown his Calvin Kleins into his Timberlands as\nhis bimbo girlfriend pulls him away, our laughter\nechoing in his ears. Here comes a friendly-look-ing crusty blok e who looks like he can take a laugh. 1 think about warning him, but it's out of\nthe question. The tension rises as he steps\nnearer the trap, but miracles of miracles his foot\nlands a micron to the side and, unknowingly, he\navoids a boot full of shite.\nI'm standing in the mud at the Other Stage,\nwatching it sink and waiting for Ash to start, in\nfront of me there's an unusual gap in the crowd.\nThis is because there is a large, two-foot deep\nhole in the ground. Its clay-lined sides are\nfiendishly slippery, and best of all, it's invisible\nbecause it's full to the brim with a foul, piss\nfilled slurry, indistinguishable fr or rj the surrounding muck. We're standing in a crowd around it\n(many of us have fallen into it\nourselves) surreptitiously watching\nfor the next sucker who wants to\npush to the front and has just\nseen an empty space. KERSPLAT!!\nA punk goes right in, both feet,\nand lands on his backside. But he\ncan't get any purchase on the\npestilent slime, and continues to\nslide until he is submerged up to\nhis chest. There's nervous laugh-ter, but everyone's worried that\nhe's going to jump up and deck\nus. Incredibly, he laughs! The\nrelease of tension is truly fanta s tic. In reflection that was probably\nthe highlight of the festival.\nMy resounding memory of Tribal 96 was six of us, two from the group we\nwere with and the rest just random strangers kneeling in the mud looking\nfor X's pills using our UV glowing tubes to illuminate them. Incredibly,\ndespite the thousands of people dancing like mad bastards all around us\nwe found them and everyone was just so happy. A real sense of triumph.\nYou could tell he was a chemistry student though, because he spent the\nnext two hours explaining why MDMA glows in UV. ^ ^\n\n"

It stars Matthew Perry\n(Chandler form Friends to everyone\nin the entire universe except\nunicellular organisms from Saturn)\nas Alex, a pragmatic corporate type\nfrom New York, who meets, and\nbeds, Isabel (Salma Hayek). Isabel\nescapes in the night to avoid the\nmorning after, only to discover that\nshe is pregnant. She turns up three\nmonths later to tell Alex the news,\nwhereupon they fall in love and are\nmarried by an Elvis impersonator in\nLas Vegas. And then the film really\ngets started.\nRunning against type for a romantic comedy (two ill-suited\npeople hate each other, are thrown\ntogether by all manner of ridiculous\ncoincidences, and finally fall\nmiraculously in love in the last ten\nminutes) by having the two ill-LA CONFIDENTIAL\nStarring: Kevin Spacey, Guy\nPearce, Danny DeVito\nDirector: Curtis Hanson\nS et in 1950s Los Angeles, the\nfilm is based around the city's notoriously corrupt police\nforce. Guy Pearce (former drag\nqueen in Priscilla Queen of the\nDesert, otherwise known as Mike\nfrom Neighbours) is Officer Exley, a naive misfit who is unafraid of\nsnitching on his colleagues for\n- beating up innocent immigrants on\nChristmas Eve. In contrast, one of\nExley's contemporaries, Bud\nWhite, is an impulsive, fiery and\nviolent cop who uses brawn to\nsettle his arguments and was one\nof the offending cops. However,\nWhite has a soft spot for protecting\nwomen and runs to the aid of every\ndamsel who appears to be in dis-tress, including Kim Basinger. She\nplays one of the local upper-class\nprostitutes who undergo surgery to\nresemble film stars for the pleasure\nof their clients. After the murder of\nWhite's partner, Exley is\nput second in command of an\ninvestigation which unfolds more\nsuited people fall in love at the\nstart, there is the hope that we are\nseeing something different. This is,\nunfortunately, not to be. The\nincidents that are supposed to\ncause conflict seem weak and\ncontrived, never making us doubt\nthat they are going to live happily\npolice corruption than he had\npreviously thought imaginable.\nThe film is slightly slow to begin\nwith an uninteresting narrative by\nDanny DeVito but the plot soon\nthickens, albeit in an unsurprising\n\"good cop-bad cop\" direction.\nThe acting is first-rate, especially\nKevin Spacey's celebrity detective\nwho thrives on appearing on front\npages. Guy Pearce is also more\nthan up to holding his own in such\ndistinguished company. The storyline is seamless and the scenes\nwell sequenced, nudging the\nabsorbed viewer toward the conclusion without valuable brain-power being consumed. The whole\nfilm has a comic book feel to it\nwhile at the same time managing\nto be complex enough to have\nseveral themes running through it\nsimultaneously.\nThe only qualms about all this is\nthe slightly dubious moral at the\nend, which sees the idealistic Exley\nswinging his fists along with the\nviolent colleagues he had\npreviously despised. Nevertheless,\nthis is an an entertaining and stylish\nfilm that is well worth the entrance\nfee. \u2022\nClubber &. Lips\never after.

Guy Carson is a scientist\nworking for the Genedyne corpora-tion, a world leader in biotech no lo gy. The story is predominantly set\nat the Mount Dragon complex, a high research base in the desert\nand site of Genedyne's most ambitious genetic engineering project.\nWhen Guy Carson is transferred to\nwork at Mount Dragon he is determined to succeed in his task but\nthe efficiency of the Mount Dragon\ncomplex is about to disintegrate as\nsome disturbing facts are revealed.\nThe ethics of genetic engineering\nare raised early in the story with the\ntwo opposing viewpoints material-ising in the form of two main char-act ers. These moral viewpoints are\nhandled well as the reader can\nappreciate the possible dangers\nand benefits of Genedyne's research. Preston doesn't pressurize the reader into taking sides but\nskillfully reveals more information\nas the novel progresses. The story\nskips between locations as it follows the progress of different characters and this can often be confusing but it does help to maintain\nthe suspense of the novel especially as the plot develops. Irrelevent\ndescriptive passages detract from\nthe story from the story in some\nareas and the overuse of scientific\ndetail only serves to confuse when\nused inappropriately. The conclusion to this story is stretched out\nfor too long as the ending becomes\nobvious long before it materializes.\nPreston attempts to involve a little\nromance towards the end but this\nis handled poorly as if it was\nthrown in because the main characters had nothing else to do! A few loose ends need firmly knotting together at the end. This novel\ncontributes some interesting points\nto the genetic engineering debate\nand does well in exploring the reasoning behind each characters\nbeliefs.

I found it almost impossible to look at these photographs\nwith an impartial eye. Heaven knows how the judges managed to keep their impartiality and judge the entries not\nonly on aesthetic appeal and originality, but also on technical difficulty and brilliance! The exhibition has certainly\nachieved its aim of promoting the beauty and wonder of\nthe natural world.\nThe most poignant categories were Urban and Garden\nWildlife and Animal Behaviour. It was amazing to see how\nwell animals can adapt to an artificial urban environment.\nCrows nested on a pile of coat hangers; an arctic fox made\nits den in a rubbish tip where it could take full advantage\nof all the scraps thrown out by humans.\nThe Animal Behaviour category brought me back into\nthe real world.

    "content": "31 October 1997 NEWS\nStudents\nDisillusioned\nDESPITE ASSURANCES, BLUNKETT'S NEW FEES ARE PUTTING OFF THOUSANDS OF PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS\nThe Government's proposal to\nintroduce tuition fees has caused\nmore controversy this week when\nUCAS disclosed that application\nfigures for the coming year had\ndropped by eleven percent. This\nputs into question the claim by the\nGovernment that the new student\ntuition fees and the abolition of the\ngrant will not deter students from\nentering higher education.\nThe deadline for Oxbridge\napplications - the first indication of\nuniversity application rates -dropped from\n44,200\n39,369, bucking\nthe upward\ntrend of the previous five years.\nUCAS commented that there\nmay be 80,000\nfewer applicants\nif the trend con-tin u es. This\ncould mean\nsevere recruitment and funding problems,\nespecially for the\nnewer and smaller universities,\nwho are already having to cut\ncourses to make up the shortfall.\nVice-Chancellors are worried that\nconfusion caused by the\nGovernment over the summer and\ntheir faulty leaflet on fees was contributing to the bewilderment that\nmany potential students are experiencing. The Government denied that\nthis was a problem, saying that the\nintroduction of fees didn't have any\neffect on financially needy stu-dents, since they would not be\nasked to pay tuition fees.\nEducation and Employment\nSecretary David Blunkett said that\nhe would still monitor the figures to\nidentify reasons for the alarming\ndrop in applications, saying \"we\nneed to know whether it is poor\naspirations or fear of debt that\ndeters people from lower socioeconomic classes from applying to\nuniversity.\" Such students applying\nto London for a four year course\ncould find themselves \u00a320,000 in\ndebt on g radu aNUS President Douglas Trainer\nsaid that he saw\nthe drop as proof\nthat tuition fees\nand zero maintenance would\ndeter students.\nNUS president Doug Trainer Trainer has been\naddressing the conference at UCL coming under\nlast week, flak himself\nPhoto: Sarah Lee (nicked from recently, being\nLondon Student - sorry about that) accused of compromising NUS\npolicy by agreeing to negotiate\nwith the Government on the fees\nissue. \"We are disgusted and\nappalled at the lack of action from\nthe NUS leadership with regards to\ntuition fees. They have sold out\nstudents in the future\", a Leeds\nUnion Officer was quoted as say-ing. A number of NUS unions\nintend to call an emergency meeting to oust the leadership, including Trainer.\nHamish Common\nBig Brother is\nWatching You, Wilson\nSecurity in Wilson House is\nexpected to improve after the\nrecent installation of a new swipe\ncard entry system and several\nCCTV cameras around the site.\nFollowing the introduction of\nthe new system, only residents of\nthe hall can use their swipe card to\nenter through the front door.\nVisitors are required to press a buzzer to gain access from the\nporter.\nIn order to allow the porter to\nalso keep an eye on users of the\nsports hall, which shares the back\nentrance with Wilson House, the\nlodge has now been relocated to\nthe back of the foyer. Removal of\nthe old lodge should be completed\nby Christmas.\nThe most significant feature of\nthe new setup, technically termed\nthe digital video storage and transmission system (DVST), is that the\nCCTVs would be linked to the security unit in Sherfield Building. This\nwould provide the much needed\n\"Big Brother Watch\" after the porter\nhas gone off duty. The cameras can\nalso alert the porter to incidents\nwhich take place at other parts of\nthe building outside the porter's view.\nPreviously, residents had to\ninsert a metal security tag into a slot in order to open the front\ndoor. When asked how the new\nswipe card improves from the old\npractice, Derrick Victor, residence\nbuilding manager, cited its flexibility in allowing temporary access to\nthe house to selected people under\nspecial circumstances. Moreover, it\nis his long term aim to extend the\nswipe card entry system to cover\nevery single room in the hall of res-i den ce. Such a scheme is currently\nunder trial in Beit Hall. As a result\nof two recent incidences where\npeople broke through the windows\nto gain access into students'\nrooms, the possibility of fixing bars\noutside the windows of the basement rooms was also discussed.\nHowever, the proposal was likely\nto be opposed by fire safety officers.

    "content": "8 COLUMNS 31 October 1997\nWell, another group of\ninmates successfully\nparaded before the\nparole board. I refer, of course, to\nCommemoration Day, so called,\nboys and girls, because it commemorates the visit of King\nGeorge VI and Queen Elizabeth,\nnow the Queen Mother, to the\nCollege on the occasion of the one\nhundredth anniversary of the foundation of the Royal College of\nChemistry. Though I wasn't there\nthis year- my invitation from the\nGovernors must have got lost in\nthe post- my friends and colleagues tell me that it was, as last\nyear, excellent. Full marks must go\nto Vernon McClure and his\nRegistry staff for a first class event;\nnot everything conceived within\nthe corridors of Sherfield is an\nunmitigated disaster.\nOne thing 1 do like to do in this\njob from time to time is pick over\nthe bones of the letters page. Not\nusually a place for rich pickings, we\nhad a few good ones last week.\nFirstly, Montpelier Hall. The\nnatives are restless, since IC plans\nto sell their home. Understandable\nanxiety, but they themselves have\nhit the nail on the head. 'It's[ sic]\nsituation has to be the best of all\nImperial College halls...within\nclose proximity to the best known\nshops in London.' The decision to\nsell, raising over \u00a35milion, is not\n'ineptitude.' It makes no sense, I'm afraid, for Imperial to hold such\nvaluable properties as student res-i den ces. Last year I suggested that\nwe lease back all our halls of residences, thus freeing up huge\namounts of capital that could be\nused for improve-ment, which\ncould even make\nthis conferencing\npipe dream feasible (all right,\nthat's perhaps\nstraining c red uli ty). What is a shame however,\nis that IC does\nnot have the\nmanagement competence to redevelop\nMontpelier in-house, an idea that\ncould make us an absolute for-tune.\nSomething really seems to\nhave rattled the cage of young Mr\nBio2 (funny surname, Martin).\nThough 1 have some sympathy\nwith the thoughts expressed, most\ncredibility is lost under a mountain\nof ignorance. You missed the key\npoint. Rules on posters (is this\ntrue?) and suchlike are all made by\nstudents, and that's the frightening\nthing. Regular readers will know\nthat I rarely lock horns with the\nUnion, because it is not something\nabout which I know very little. A word of warning. Never attack ICU\nunless you are very sure of your\nfacts. There are legions of students\nout there that\nknow the\nConstitution inside out, and\nare not averse to\nspouting it at\ngreat length.\nNow don't get\nme wrong, 1 am\nnot anti-Union.\nOur s abs, by and\nlarge, have done\na very good job\nover the last few\n' r years, not least\nEric Allsop, who has presided over\na rather tricky period of office. The\nproblem lies with some of the\nhacks on the various committees,\nexecutives and councils. These\naugust bodies hold a great fascination for children who love the\nsound of their own voices and like\nto play politics, hence some of the\nridiculous rulings that they gene r ate. This results in good people\nbeing dissuaded from getting\ninvolved in ICU, seeing it, wrongly,\nas somewhat of an irrelevance\nbeyond the provision of 'cheap\nbeer and curries.'\nYou would expect the Union to\nbe very open, but at one of last\nyear's hustings, someone talked\nabout the Union's reserves.\nCurious, 1 asked a friend of mine\nthere, who knows about these\nthings, how much they had. He initially said that he was not permitted to tell me. He did then quietly\nsay, but 1 was amazed. I expect\nthis from Sherfield, but not ICU,\nparticularly when, as I later disco v ered, the figure is on the College\nwebsite. I'm not saying that this is\ntypical, but it does not instil confidence, does it?\nFinally, much has been written\nabout the behaviour of the Rugby\nand Football clubs in Southside. I must say their behaviour was terri-ble. I have never seen such a pathetic attempt at boat racing in\nmy life. No one need worry about\ninstitutional is ed drinking here this\nyear. As for the small fracas, don't let that worry you. I have since\nmade many visits to Southside,\nand can assure that it is quiet safe.\nBeer's not bad, either. Actually,\nthat's untrue. It is superb.\nGraduate\ninto the\noil and gas\nindustry\nAmerada Hess are an American - owned\ninternational oil & gas exploration and\nproduction company. In the North Sea, we are\none of the largest independent operators and\nover the last two decades have built a reputation for technological excellence\nand achievement.\nWe are now looking to recruit a recent\ngraduate in Physics, Engineering or Chemistry,\nto join the team that is responsible for the\naccurate measuring, recording and allocation\nof the oil and gas that we produce.

IC held on to their lead\nuntil a deflected shot was un for giv ably fumbled by keeper Jimmy. But\nour saviour arrived in the shape of\nDimitris, who received the ball from\nthe centre, shot down the left wing,\nburst into the RSM box and rifled\nthe ball into their net.
