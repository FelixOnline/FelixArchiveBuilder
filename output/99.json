    "content": "FELIX LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nRoom 17,\nC&Q. Sir,1 was particularly pleased to read in the last issue of 'Felix' that you considered Imperial\nCollege to be a business concern. So many of\nyour predecessors have insisted that it is a University, where we should take part in numerous \"other\" activities not shown in the syl lab us, that it is refreshing to find an Sditor of\nFelix^ with sufficient courage to print the truth.\nYou were wise to point out how irresponsible\nit is for students of I.C. to express in public\nany political views that might be the slightest\nbit controversial and I would add that since\nwe are all training to be technologists we are\nnot expected to take interest in shaping national policy.\nFortified by your words I shall continue to\nattend at IyC. regularly from 9.30 a.m. to 5.30\np.m. and shun like the plague any activities organised outside these business hours.\nGrateful Brown Bagger.\nI.G. Union,\n24th November.\nDear Sir,\nThe College Staff already have two Senior\nCommon Rooms, each with adjoining dining facilities.\nOne is in the Ayrton Hall; the other is in the Queen's Gate premises.\nOur new UnionBuilding is, in toto, hardly\nadequate for the number of students in the oo lle ge, but I have no obj eot ion to our Staff having a common\nroom in that building provided that those who U3e it join the Union (\u00a33. 3. 0. Idfe Membership) and also\nshare it with students when occasions demand.\nYours faithfully,\nHubert Smith.\nI.C. Hostel.\nNov. 24th. Sir, It came as a surprise, indeed a shock,\nto find that the editor of \"Felix\" could\nlike na college of a University to a business concern. Whereby opinions, and liberty of thought and action, are only to be\nenjoyed provided that the result is a commercial success.\nDisraeli once said \" A University should\nbe a place of light, of liberty and of\nlearning\". If the editor is really serious\nin his argument then I would suggest that he\ndoes not consider I.C. to be worthy of the\nstatus of a University College. He falls in completely, in fact, with Mr. Higson who in\nhis letter considers that because money is being spent on I.C. we should bow, say\n\u2022Thank you' and forget to voice our opinions.\nNo sir J This is not what the attitude of\nUniversity students should be; our independence and thought should be un trammelled toy\nconsideration of outside influences. It'\nseems a pity that the editor of \"Felix\"\nshould subscribe to the view that I.C. is not af University level. Yours faithfully L. Allen.\nC.&G. Onion,\n20 th. Nov. 1956\nDear Sir, In attempting to answer in part the\nletter from J. L. Sellars in the last issue\nof FELIX, I can assure him that the small\nrepresentation of Guilds in this year's procession was due neither to incompetence\nnor apathy.\nAfter last year's excellent Show the\nUnion was assured that they would again be\nin yi ted to participate, and this year the\nCity Remembrancer wrote an invitation to\nboth Guilds and Kings dated July 31st., Inv it ing them to participate. However, both\nletters were sent to Kings and, to quote\nfrom his letter to me: \"I was deeply di stressed to know that as a result of the\nmal dr o it ness for which I take full resp on sibi lit y of the letter to you being\nmisdirected \" it was, therefore, no\nfault of the Guilds' Committee that earlier\narrangements were not made.\nAt the beginning of the session, perturbed by the lack of an invitation, I was\nrequested by the Committee to approach the\nAuthorities. It then came to light that this\nerror had been made, and, furthermore, that\nKings had not seen fit to forward our invitation. At such a comparatively late date it was not possible to have more than four\nGuildsmen in the Show. However our representation was such that the Guilds Crest\nappeared on our float - \"Aluminium in Structures\" - and, in the end, there were six\nGuildsmen in the procession, the two reserves\nbeing found additional places at the rear of\nthe procession at the last minute.\nIn conclusion, I again quote from a letter from the City Remembrancer: \" I am\ndelighted that you were able to take part\nin the procession and I assure you quite\nseriously that your participation year by\nyear is much valued. May it long continue.\"\nThe Remembrancer is also fully aware\nof the action of Kings and of the resultant\nprotest by the College after the Show - I made sure of that }\nYours sincerely,\nJ. A. Hobson.\n/ t>o hi rCA& \u00a3 h/ \u00bb/9T CH&MlCAL ANALYSIS\nPAoV/ZS \u2014 Moaners Sou?

November were organised hy the I.C. Conservative\nSociety on the one hand and the Socialist Society on\nthe other. The large attendance at both these meetings\nindicates that interest in politics is still very\nalive at I.C. The Conservative Society had as their Guest Speaker Mr. Harold Watkinson, the Minister of Transport,\nwho spoke about the future of British roads. Mr. Watkinson gave a brief outline of the network of motorways that he proposed to construct and explained why\nthis particular plan had been adopted. In the course\nof his remarks he pointed out the necessity of having\nan overall plan for all forms of transportation, within the framework of wh i oh the new road programme must\nfit. He also said that the new motorways were planned\nprimarily for trucks, not the private motorist, and\nthat coupled with any new motorway there had to be\nadequate ring roads within the oi ties so that traffic\ncould gain easy access to the factory areas.\nThe lecture organised by the Socialist Society\nhad the provocative title \"A British Communist looks\nat Hungary\" and, as expected, led to some very lively discussion. The speaker was Mr. Tom Durkin, who\nwas introduced by John Cox.\nMr. Durkin spoke for 35 minutes, during wh i oh time he was frequently interrupted from the back of\nthe hall, then he bravely volunteered to answer ques-t ions. The questions eventually turned into a general\ndebate from the floor. At one time the speaker simply\nsat back and let his audience get on with it. The mee sti ug was scheduled to end at 2.15 p.m. Hut actually continued until 3*30 p.m. when it was\nfinally broken v cp by the entrance of Physios III for\na lecture.\nfat ch out. Guilds.\nAnthony Hopkins - General Studies\nlecturer - professed a passionate regard\nfor Bo. Petrol rationing or not it may appear\nelsewhere than on the cover of Punch - perhaps the next Hoffnung Concert.\nHonorary Awards.\nTed Smith, who will have been here\n30 years come April 1st, and Mooney, for\nhis great efforts in the Refectory at the\nbeginning of the term, have been made\nHonorary Life Members of the Union in recognition of their services.\nClosed Shop Policy.\nLast year the Bookstall refused to\nsell Christmas Cards to certain non-union\nmembers of the staff. The Domestic Bursar\nhas now produced an unofficial card, for\nsale to staff and students, in competition\nwith the official Union Card.. The unofficial card, which is of poor quality, is the\none with the photo of the Rodei-Cc Hill\nbuilding.\nCarnival Chaos.\nThe postponement of the Carnival will\nhave repercussions elsewhere. In past years\nthe Bedford and R.C.A. Balls have been held\non the same date as the Carnival, (o oll usi on between entertainments committees?). It has\nbecome the accepted|practice for the more\nvirile attending the Balls to round off the\nnight at the Carnival; must these oe leb ra,tions now end prematurely?\nDining Hall.\nlunches in the new Dining Hal] are now becoming\npopular with the rank and file. Those with more time\nto spare than for snack bar sandwiches are missing\nthe refectory queues and eating their meals in comfort.\nThe food is served hot and fowl appears on the menu\nalmost daily.\nRector's Round.\nThe Reotor presented plaques with the crests of\nI.C. and the three constituent colleges to the respective presidents at Hall Dinner on 20th. Nov. The\nplaques, wh i oh are to adorn the new bar were produced\nfrom a brown bag (J) and were wrapped in a eo py of\n'Felix'(J). In thanking the Reotor, Kitoh expressed\nregret that the Dinner could not terminate in the new\nbar, where the cry \"Drinks all round on the Rector*\nmight have been heard.\nDrum Rolls Again.\nR.C.S. are to manufacture a drum as at hi ev able and audible totem. This will enable Guilds to attempt\nto regain face after their dreadful neglect of the\nSpanner.\nHopping Mad.\nIt has been revealed that only eight ICWArians\nsupported their dance a week last Saturday. Is this,\nbecause the President issued an edict forbidding\nfrater n is ation within the oo lle ge? There can be mo reflection oas t on the males\nhere; maiden* from elsewhere flocked to the hop -and had to be turned away in large numbers, dis-appointed.\n\n"

    "content": "\u00a3 L IX\nCIRCULATION1400 Editor :\nWARNING! J. BRAMLEY\nDid you know that it is not unusual for\nthere to be two or three cases of larceny in the College or Union PER DAY 1 If you do not\nbelieve this then ask the I.C. Security Of fic er, J. HENRY. Because, generally speaking,\nmembers of the College are not sufficiently concerned with the safety of their property,\nI.C. has become the happy-hunting ground of\nthe petty thief, and Mr. Henry has been working overtime.\nDo you, for example, lock your bicycle\nif you leave one at college during the day ?\nYou can be a victim of a theft. On Saturday\nlOt ht: November, two ICWArians left their\nhostel rooms unlocked whilst one went for\nher breakfast and the other took a bath. On\ntheir return they found a considerable amount\nof property had been stolen. On the same day,\na parcel which he knew to contain a65/ slide rule awaited J. Chadwick in the Hostel\nrack. He saw it at 11.50 a.m. but left it there because he was going out. On his return\nat 4.50 p.m., when he went to collect the\nparcel, he found that it had gone. Unfortunately Chadwick did not report the loss to\nMr. Henry until the following Thursday, and,\nat the time of going to press, he has not retrieved his property.\nUr. HENRY, in a special interview with\nthe Editor (the latter was identifying one of\nhis favourite pipes, an alarm clock and his\nspare spectacles which had been stolen from\nhis lab.), said that nearly all these in ci dents with which he had to deal could be prevented if members of the college were more\ncautious. He did not accuse people of being\ncareless. Prevention in this case is certainly\neasier and better than cure.\nFELIX PHOTO NEWS\nPhotographs taken by Felix reporters for\nwhich there is no room in the paper will appear\nma notice-board by the Bar door in the Ayrtcm\nHall. They will be on sale (on a non-profit\nmaking basis) to members of the college. The\nfirst attempt with this Service provoked an\nencouraging response.\nTONIGHT!! IN AYRTON HALL\nMINES BALL\nCURZON ORCHESTRA 9-3\nFOR THE RECORD\nby the Editor.\nThose who are responsible for \"Felix\" are often\nfaced with a dilemma during the \"printing week\" between\nthe going to print and the sale of the paper. When events\nof importance occur during those few days, do they rush\nbrief notice of these into \"Stop Press\", making space by\nsacrificing some article that has already been inserted?\n- or do they save the reports so that they appear three\nweeks later when their news value has been lost? This\nreview is an attempt to solve the problem.\nLet us turn first to Morphy Day. Our report in the\nlast issue was a hurriedly prepared one. The omission,\"\non the'back page, of the cox es' names from those of the\nwinning crews was a regretted oversight. The two were\nP. Bumby, Mines Morphy, and J. Alexander, Guilds Lowry.\nOn Tuesday the 13th November Jezebel, the R.C.S. Fire Engine, was christened. In the photograph that we\nwere able to slip into the last issue, Robin Bray, the\nImperial College Bard, is seen standing on the engine\nreciting an ode to grace the occasion. Jezebel has now\nofficially \"taken to the road\". We wish her a long and\neventful career.\nDinner in Hall on the evening of that day provided\nanother memorable occasion of a different kind. It was\nthe first of these functions to be haldi n the new\nDining Hall and several distinguished guests were present.\nOne of the most distinguished of those, Sir Alfred\nEgerton, a much valued friend of the Union, presented\ntwo beautiful ornate silver candlesticks to the college.\nThese had been handed down the Egerton family tree for\nmany years. They represent a really personal gift for\nwh i oh everyone is most grateful.\nThe last item to be recorded also is an event wh i oh took place on the Tuesday. Keith Miller returned to I.C. to give a General Studies Lecture:\"Training for the\nHimalayan Expedition\". This was an account of the\nMountaineering Club's training visit to Switzerland\nduring the summer vacation and was illustrated with some\nfirst-class colour slides. Keith's forthright delivery\nand \"earthy\" language excited the enthusiasm of a large\naudience. It was one of the most successful General\nStudies Lectures since the scheme began.

The 300 people concerned probably provide a reasonably ty pio al sample of the whole, of I.C., although\nit is possible that a higher proportion of those living\nnear the oo lle ge than those living in remote places did\nnot trouble to parti oi pate. Factual results of the survey are as follows. The\ngreatest concentration of I.C. students in digs falls\nin two areas : between Chiswiok and Ealing and in the\nBattersea-Clapham area. 30$ of those responding to the\nsurvey o a me from the former area and 2\n5\n?\n& from the latter.\nNo regional variation in charges was apparent, except\nthat those specifying Earl's Court as their area seemed\nto pay distinctly more than elsewhere. The average charge\nfor a single room without food is between thirty shillings\nand two pounds (although sane pay up to \u00a33). for bed an<i breakfast the usual charge is between fifty shillings\nand three pounds (though some pay up to \u00a34). Moat students\nin digs (65 fo) return to their abodes for an evening meal\nand are also provided with|lunch on Sundays. Such people\npay an average of 3 i guineas weekly. It is hoped that\nthese figures might help/people who are being swindled\nto appreciate the fact. It is impossible to pinpoint\nindividual oases of overcharging from the forms as\npayment mu3t depend on the quality of the rooms and\nsubsidiary facilities provided.\nVery few grumble at extra charges for gas, heating\netc, but many do grumble at the money and time wasted\nin travelling. One student in five spends more i han two\nhours travelling each day. A further 15$ estimate/their\ntravelling at l \u00a3 hrs and 42fa at about one hour. Since\nabout two-thirds of these return to their digs for j upper, it is small wander that so many I.C. student* are rarely\nto be seen around the Union in the evenings.

    "content": "FELIX3 Profile JOHN LANCELOT SAUNDERS This Sir Galahad of I.C. is more generally\nknown as \"Dick\" - John \"being so common as\nto almost he of no use as a name, Lancelot\nbeing too em baras sing I His bearded and\nMephistophelean countenance is destined for\neven greater notoriety, owing to a current\npublicity campaign. The beard began as a 'dare' and is now being defiantly maintained\n- as also is the eternal search for the\nfew \"who don't strongly object to \u2022whiskers\".\nIt also provides an effective answer to offers\nof stage make-up - \"No thanks, I grow my\nown.\"\nOf his school career he has little to\nsay except that he ran as a quarter-miler\nand played the only sane character - Mortimer\nBrewster - in \"Arsenic and Old Lace\". Not\nin character ? \"I'm not a Brewster, I'm the son of a3 ea cook.\" - On second\nthoughts, yes I He entered I.C. in 1950 for the Inter.\nCourse (?) and proceeded to study Physics'in\nhis next year, still talc ing part in athletics\nand the Dramatic Society. After the usual\ndisagreement with the examiners in 1952 he\ndeparted for the S.A.P., of which he was still a member as Junior Technician Acting Corporal\n(Paid) when he returned to City and Guilds\nin 1954 - in fact he enjoyed the dist inc tion of receiving pay from both his County\nand the R.A.F. during his first three weeks\nDack.\nHis memory stretches back to the times\nwhen Kitch was an under-graduate and includes\nsuch historic occasions as that when R.C.S. held an Official Union meeting at 11.30 p.m. on Piooadilly Underground Station!\nHe has taken an active part in Union\naffairs - a recent copy of 'Phoenix' shows\nhim clasping a young lady in a distinctly\nnon-L fashion at the Pawnee Potlatch. In\nthe Dram. Soc. he has taken a selection of\nroles, painted scenery and even tried his\nhand at producing - he insists that he had\nno hand in \"The White Sheep of the Family\"\nAfter a year a3 Society Secretary, he\nwas the only member with a sufficiently unreliable \"car\" to follow in Ian Duff's steps\nas President of I.C.D. S.( the petrol shortage\ndoesn't worry his as it appears to run on ape ou liar mixture of water and oil). In\nthis position he has had the unenviable task\nof trying to c hiv vy the planning office into\nhaving the Concert Hall ready for the\ninaugural production of \"Loftur\" - a mighty\ne pio, vaguely reminiscent of the land of\nEskimo Nell and starring (yes, you've guessed\nit J) Dick Saunders.\nA last point - those visiting his room\nare requested to refrain from roller-skating\non his ceiling.\nContinued from page 1.\nNow for the background to the question about flats\nvery o lose to the oo lle ge. As all readers are aware, the\noo lle ge has acquired the north, east and south sides of\nPrinces Gardens. The east and south sides are practically\nderelict (except for the Air Squadron and its two nearest\nneighbours w hio hI. C. do not own). The existing buildings\nwill be demolished and replaced by hostels as soon as red-tape and contractors will allow. It is estimated that\naccommodation for about 600 (plus two large refectories\non the south side) will be ready by autumn, 1959.\nThe north side is more of a problem. Some leases\ndo not run out for about 8 years, and the site o an not be developed properly until then. However, certain\nhouses are in such condition that they could be renovated\nto serve as temporary flats during this period. The\ncollege would require to recover their outlay involved\nin such renovation in rents spread over the eight-year\nperiod. Aoi rou lar was sent to all members of staff asking\nwhether they would be interested in living in such flats.\nAs soon as this came to the not ioe of the Union Executive\nstrong representations were made to the college authorities\nthat such flats should be available for\nstudents to share, since Princes Gardens was\npurchased expressly for student residence. A rough investigation by the Domestic Bursar,\nMr. Seaford, and the I.C. President showed\nthat between 60 and 100 students could jj rob ably be accommodated (depending on the state of\nd elapid ation of certain houses) and that the\nrents would probably be well within the scope\nof PG's and overseas students and possibly of\nundergrads as well, A professional survey, at\npresent in progress, will confirm or disprove\nthese hopes. Mr. Seaford thinks that flats\ncould be made ready for next session.\nThe Executive hoped that the lodgings\nsurvey would strengthen their case for making\nthe flats available to students. Over half of\nthose responding to the survey said they would\nbe interested, and suggested an average of \u00a32\nper week per head.Some offered considerably\nmore.

    "content": "SPORTSNB\u00a3\nRUGGER\nSince the last issue of Felix I.C.l st. XV have steadily improved and have succeeded\nin winning all their matches. The excellent\nplaying record of the other teams has also been\nmaintained and this augurs well for the strength\nof the club in future years.\nAgainst N.E,C. the college team was obviously\nsuperior from the start and only poor finishing\nprevented I.C. from amassing a mammoth score.\nAfter some hard luck with the kicking the match\nwas eventually won by six tries and a goal to\na try. At home to London Welsh A, the I.C. pack\nplayed with more spirit and were able to give\nthe backs more than their share of the ball. Seed and Milward at half back who had previously\nbeen playing for the second XV acquitted themselves well and after being 6-3 up at half time\nI.C. were able to take advantage of a tiring opposition to finish winners by 17 pts. to 3.\nLast Saturday x.C. played Wadham College,\nOxford when the pack gave a plentiful supply\nof the ball from the scrum and line out. This\nprovided some much needed practice at giving\nand taking a pass for the backs. Eventually\nthey settled down and following a penalty goal\n(Stone) four tries were scored by half time\nwith the help of some excellent backing up by\nthe back row of the scrum. In the second half\nI.C. failed to press home their advantage and\nalthough three more tries were scored two penalty\ngoals were conceded to make the score I.C.24 pts,\nWadham 6 pts.\nThe 2nd., B and C XVs. are to be congratulated on having each won five out of six matches\nThe A XV have only lost two and succeeded in defeating their opposition on Saturday with only\n13 men on the field. SWIMMING CLUB Injuries have had an affect on the results\nof the club so far this term. In our recent\nmatch against U.C., two University swimmers\nwere absent and this probably enabled our opponents to gain a narrow victory. However\nhonour was regained when I.C. won the water-polo 4-1.\nThe trip to Aylesford Paper Mills proved\nsuccessful as far as sport was concerned\nthough I.C. were beaten 6-3 goals in the water\npolo.\nThe clubs best result to date was in defeating Polytechnic by 8-5 goals. This team had\ndefeated every other team in the University.\nAt one stage I.C. were leading by 7-2 goals\nand Poly drew back to 7-5 goals before I.C. scored again.\nTwo second team games have been played\nand unfortunately both lost, Kings II by\n3-5 goals and Q.M. C. by 3-5 goals.\nRIFLE CLUB on the MARK After two rounds of the Inter-collegiate\nleague the A team is top of the first division,\nhaving beaten Kings and tied with U.C. The B and C teams are first and second respect iv ly in the second division and the D team is top\nof the third.\nIn the first round of the Inter University\nLeague the A team has been successful in beating\nBirmingham. If the teams can gain a little more consist an cy the Engineers and Inter Unlversilty Cups may return to us after a year's absence\nJUDO The Judo Club have started well by winning\ntheir first two matches this season quite\ndecisively. A six man team from R.M.A. Sandhurst visited us a fortnight ago and went\ndown 5-1 (two draws). Messrs. Rodwell, Burford\nand Gorb gaining the full two points.\nLast Saturday we visited Cambridge and won\nthe main contest 5^-2^, Williams and Shepherd\ngaining maxima. The 'two team' contest was\nwon quite comfortably with four men left,, Wright\naccounting for the last two Cambridge men.\nSAILING CLUB On Sunday November 18th. the I.C. Sailing\nClub had its away match against Southamptoni\nUniversity Sailing Club. On arrival at Hambles,\nwhere the match was to take place^nc opponents\nnor anybody else could be found. After'some\nfrantic \"phoning the Southampton team was finally found and the match could take place. It was\nsailed on the River Hamble, from which the\nwater was fast disappearing out to sea, leaving\na lot of dirty-looking mud behind. The wind\nwas just strong enough to enable one to make\nway against the tide and current.\nThe match was sailed in 'Fleetwinds'.\nInstead of the usual two- races with three\nboats to each team, three races with two\nboats to each team were sailed, as only\nfour boats were available. I.C. obtained\nmaximum points in the two first races placing\nfirst and second. However in the last race\na Southampton boat was first home, with two\nI.C. boats following closely behind. The\nfinal score was I.C.37^, Southampton 29^.\nThe members of the I.C. team were\nM. Collyear (Capt.), T. Danbury, C. Ghent,\nC. French and Miss E.

The l st. XI has\nnot been at full strength for several weeks\ndue to unavoidable injuries, and our 2nd. XI captain D. Baxter suffered- a broken leg\nlast week in a league game against L.S.E. We send him our best wishes and hope that\nhe will soon be released from hospital to\nbe with us again.\nall four teams continue to do very well\nin their respective leagues and. if the present\nstandard is kept up they should all be at the\ntop by the end of the season x The results of the friendly matches are\nnot ao satisfactory and after each game we\nwalked off the field saying that we should have\nhave won that game.

NOVEMBER.\nAlthough the afternoon of the 21st. Nov.\nwas fortunately fine and clear, it wa3 rather\ncold for athletics. In spite of this there\nwere some very good performances and I. C.A.C. can be proud of their achievements. After\nwinning the 'TJALVE' trophy last year for the\nField Events Competition, I.C. did not disgrace\nthemselves by coming 3rd. this year with 22 pts.\nbehind Middlesex Hospital (27 pts) and Guys\nHospital (24 pts).\nOnly three members of last years team were\ncompeting. M.J. RIckard who gallantly appeared\nfrom semi-retirement and J.D. Lawrence both\njumped 5'6\" in the high jump to gain 2nd. place.\nIn the long jump Lawrence (19'0\") and D.C. Smith\n(20'10\"), who is a regular member of the Univers it y Team in the H.S. J., gained 2nd. place. In\nthe Hop,Step,and Jump, Smith jumped 44'7\" to set\na new College Record to be the individual\nwinner. This jump along with Lawrences 40'6\"\nprovided I.C. with l st. place.\nIn the throwing event,3 I.C. were represented\nentirely by fresher s, most of whom were almost\ncompletely unfamiliar with the senior implements..\nThe performances of our field events men were\ndistinctly promising for next season and particular mention should be made of J. Newman who will be a great asset to the club in the future.\nTrying his hand for the ii rst time Newman threw\nthe hammer 56'2\" but was un placed. A.W. Smith\nvaulted 9'0n to gain 5th. place in the pole\nvault and M. Evans threw a senior javelin for the\nfirst time 128'6\" but being our only competitor\nin this event we were un placed. In the discus\nNewman (98'6\") and Sharrocks (89'0\") were in7 th. place. The other event in which I.C. scored\n2nd. place was the weight where Newman did 35\"10\"\nand Coope 31'0\". Unfortunatly Coope will be\noverseas in the summer.\nOn the track, I.C. were second with 10 pts.\nbehind U.C. with 16 pts. Our team of M.P. Jarrett\nB. Curtis, P. Harrison and D.W. J MacKenzie were\neliminated in the 4x110y ds. relay heats. However in the 880x1m ilex880 relay, I.C. wOn bj\na convincing margin with K. Wall, J. Evans and\nL.C. Locke all running very well. In the 220x220x440y ds relay our team of R. Harrison, B. Curtis\nand P.M. Rayment, all fresher s, won their heat\nand were third behind U.C. and London Hosp.\nMention is to be made of the fresher s Curtis\nand Rayment. Both ran ex tem ely well and we\nloo! forward to seeing them on the track this\nsummer.\nCROSS COUNTRY CLUB\nOn Sat. Nov. 17th. a very successful 12-a side match was held on our course in Richmond\nPark against R.A.F. Cranwell, the latter team\nwinning by 92pts. to 118pts. The following Wed. a weakened first team\neasily triumphed over Q.M. C. by 32pts. to 47.\nThe first team suffered their first defeat last\nSaturday, just losing to a strong Bristol Univ.\nteam :- Bristol38 pts. I.C.43 pts. St. Caths.\nColl. Cambridge, 104 pts. This was a very fast\nrace in which the first six runners home all beat 29 mins. for our 5 i mile course.\nA noticeable feature of the last four matches\nhas been the great Improvement in time shown by\nseveral members of the Club. This is a very good\nsign especially as the U.L. Championships are now\nonly two weeks ahead. It gives good reason to\nhope that we shall do at least as well as last\nyear when our first team was 2nd. and our second\nteam 5th. "
