    "content": "Grinding to a halt \u2013 China bans imports of waste\nLastyeartheUKexportedtwo-thirdsofitsplasticwastetoChina.In2018itbannedimports.Whatwillhappen?\nSUSTAINABILITY\nSam Owens\nSustainability Writer\nT\nhe UK has\ndeclared war\non single-use\nplastic. Reusable\ncoffee cups are every-where, with Imperial\u2019s\ncafes charging those without one an extra 15p, and\nplastic bags and straws\nare looked upon with\nhorror. The government is\nriding this wave of public\nopinion, having imposed\na 5p levy on the former in\n2015, and is in the process\nof implementing an outright ban on the latter, as\nwell as a possible charge\non plastic takeaway con-tainers. But the newfound\nrevulsion at these items\nis primarily because they\nare single-use; aren\u2019t we\nfree to purchase all the\nrecyclable plastic we\nwant, so long as we do\nthe honourable thing and\nput it in the appropriate\nbin \u2013 a win-win for the\nenvironment and our\nconscience? As of 2018, it\nturns out the answer is no.\nSince 1992, China\nhas imported 45% of all\nplastic waste intended for\nrecycling for use in its\nmanufacturing industry,\ntaking two-thirds of the\nUK\u2019s waste since 2012,\nbut in January 2018 it\nannounced it will stop\ndoing this by the end of\nthe year. The consequences of this are enormous,\nas the non-exported\nwaste may be diverted to\nlandfill, making putting it\nin a recycling bin nothing\nbut an empty gesture of\ngoodwill with no positive\nenvironmental impact.\nChina has also increased\nquality controls for other\nwaste such as cardboard,\nwhich could cause local\nauthorities to reduce their\ncollection of certain types\nof waste due to the content\nof the bins failing to meet\nthese standards, thereby\nbecoming economically\nunviable.\nThe very fact that the\nUK and many other countries such as Japan, Australia, and the US export\nthe majority of their\nwaste abroad may come\nas a surprise; few of us\nthink about what happens\nto our plastic bottle or\nfood packaging after we\n\u2018recycle\u2019 it. Apparently,\nthe UK government\ndoesn\u2019t either, as there\nappears to be no backup\nplan to deal with the\nrestriction of the world\u2019s\nlargest market for waste,\ndespite prior warnings\nthat such a situation may\noccur. Nevertheless, this\nis an opportunity for the\nUK to develop its recycling infrastructure by\ninvesting in reprocessing\nfacilities, albeit on a much\nshorter timescale than the\ngovernment might like.\nIt is also an opportunity\nto adopt an even more\nintolerant attitude towards\nplastic waste, even\nwhen it is bound for the\nrecycling bin. Single-use\nfood packaging makes\nup 89% of exported\nplastics, and while this\nmagical material has\nrevolutionised our ability\nto store and transport food\ndue to its low cost and\nphysical and chemical\nproperties, its use must\nbe minimised. There has\nrecently been an increase\nin popularity in some\ncircles of shops offering\nproducts plastic-free, but\nthere is a need for major\nretailers to step up and do\nChina used to import massive amounts of waste from around the globe // Science\nAdvances\nthe same, as problems of\nthis magnitude require a\nchange of public behaviour only achievable if\nplastic-free packaging is\ncommonplace and cheap.\nRetailers are highly receptive to public opinion,\nexercised through our\nspending habits, so we\nthe consumers, armed\nwith the knowledge that a\nlarge proportion of plastic\nis now effectively non-re-cyclable, must make an\neffort to minimise our\npurchase of it. Exactly\nhow to go about this is\nanother story \u2013 make sure\nto check back over the\nfollowing weeks to find\nout more!\nSUSTAINBILITY\nFRIDAY, 23RD\nNOVEMBER, 2018 FELIX\nesoc@imperial.ac.uk\nS\nince the 5p carrier bag charge,\nthe thought of\nthrowing away\na perfectly good plastic\nbag is enough to make\nmost of us cringe. Now\nimagine unknowingly\nthrowing away 80 plastic\nbags every month. That\u2019s\nhow much plastic the\naverage woman uses over\nher period if she throws\naway 20 disposables a\nmonth! I\u2019m not trying to\nmake women feel guilty;\ngrowing up, disposable\nmenstrual products were\nthe only options I was\ntold about. It was only a\nfew years ago I stumbled\nacross the idea of menstrual cups.\nMenstrual cups are\nmedical-grade silicone\ncups that you fold and\ninsert into your vagina to\ncollect menstrual blood,\nand which you then empty\ninto the toilet twice a\nday. They\u2019re simple to\nmaintain: wash with\nunscented soap between\nuses and boil between\ncycles.\nLet\u2019s do a calculation\n(we\u2019re at Imperial, you\ngotta love the sums).\nThe average woman\nmenstruates for 43 years\nof her life, and each year\nshe has 13 periods. That\u2019s\n559 periods \u2013 and if she\nuses 20 pads a period,\nthat comes to 11,180 pads\nbeing thrown away in her\nlifetime! In the UK alone,\n4.3 billion disposable\nmenstrual products are\nthrown away every year.\nThese products take 500\nyears to decompose,\noutlasting not only the\nwoman who had her\nperiod but generations\nafter her too. They should\nnever be flushed down the\ntoilet anyway, but flushed\nplastics still account for\n8% of beach litter found\nin the UK and can clog\nsewers and have detrimental effects on aquatic\nlife. What\u2019s more, if we\ntake into account that each\ntampon or pad costs about\n13p per unit, a woman\nspends over \u00a31400 on\nmenstrual products\nthroughout her life.\nI\u2019ve mainly been\ntalking about pads, but\ntampons are just as bad.\nTampons contain bleach\nwhich can leak into a\nwoman, and the cotton\nfibers which can be left\ninside the vagina have\nbeen linked to cervical\ncancer. If left in for too\nlong, they can even cause\nToxic Shock Syndrome\n(TSS). Menstrual cups\ncollect blood rather than\nabsorb, so have never\nbeen associated with\nTSS, nor do they disrupt\nvaginal pH levels like\npads and tampons. They\ncan also hold up to 3 times\nmore blood than a large\ntampon, and only need to\nbe changed once every 12\nhours. Women are able\nto exercise comfortably\nwearing a menstrual cup\nand can go to sleep\nwithout them leaking.\nA menstrual cup is a\none-off buy lasting you 10\nyears and is readily available in high-street stores\nsuch as Boots, and more\nrecently Tesco, being the\nfirst UK supermarket to\nstock menstrual cups.\nTOTM menstrual cups\ncost \u00a320, have entirely\nbiodegradable packaging,\nand are cruelty-free.\nWhen starting off, looking\nat a menstrual cup can be\ndaunting, but YouTube\nhas a wealth of tutorials\nfor how to fold them and,\nlike all new things, it takes\na bit of practice to master.\nDespite being invented\nin the 1930s, sadly it\u2019s\nonly now menstrual cups\nare becoming common\nknowledge. Even if you\u2019re\nnot a woman, you can still\ntake part in the discussion\nabout menstrual cups as\nthe benefits to the environment help everyone.\nHow trashy is your period?\nMenstrual cups \u2013 why you should care about periods even when you don\u2019t have one.\nSUSTAINABILITY\nPetchara Newson\nSustainability writer\nChina postpones reversal of ban on trade of tiger and rhino products.\nC\nhina has postponed previous\nplans to lift the\n2 5 - y e a r - o l d\nban on the sale and use\nof rhinoceros horn and\ntiger bone for Traditional\nChinese Medicine\n(TCM), following an\ninternational furore. This\nannouncement comes\ntwo weeks after the State\nCouncil\u2019s decision in\nOctober to reverse the\n1993 ban on the sale,\nimport, export, and use of\ntiger and rhino products,\nin order to allow their use\nfor \u201cmedical research or\nin healing\u201d from farmed\nrhinos and tigers in government certified TCM\nhospitals. Environmental\nactivists, conservation\nNGOs and experts\ncriticised the Chinese\ngovernment, saying the\ndecision would have a\n\u201cdevastating impact\u201d on\nwild populations of the already endangered species.\nStateCouncilExecutive\nSecretary-General Ding\nXuedong did not give any\nreasons why the reversal\nhas been postponed and\ndid not refer to the global\nresponse. He said the \u201cold\nban remained in force\u201d,\nbut did not specify if this\nwould be temporary or\npermanent.\nThe announcement to\nallow the trade of farmed\nrhino and tiger parts for\nTCM indicates that the\nChinese government\nvalues wildlife exclusively as products for human\nconsumption, no matter\nhow iconic or endangered.\nIt contradicts President\nXi Jinping\u2019s efforts to\nimprove China\u2019s reputation on the environmental\nfront and the country\u2019s\ntotal ban on the trade of\nelephant ivory in January\n2018.\nThe lifting of the ban,\nif it proceeds, will directly\nsupport the barbaric tiger\nfarming industry of China\nand South East Asia, and\nit comes soon after South\nAfrica\u2019s recent legali-sation of the domestic\ntrade in rhino horn,\nsupporting rhino farmers.\nFarming supporters say\nthat availability of farmed\ntigers and rhinos for use\nin TCM will alleviate\nthe poaching pressure\non wild populations, but\nconservationists argue\nthat it will only inflame\nthe global poaching and\nsmuggling crisis that is\nalready threatening to\nwipe out the <30,000\nrhino and the <4,000\ntigers left in the wild.\nNot only will this support\nthe fourth most lucrative\ninternational criminal\ntrade after drugs, weapons\nand human trafficking, it\nwill also put the lives of\ncountless conservationists\nand rangers at risk in the\nwar on poaching.\nSupporting these\ntiger and rhino farms\nwill stimulate demand\nfor these products that\nwill certainly exceed the\nsupply that farms are\nable to generate. It also\nundermines the efforts to\neradicate demand entirely\nand could erase the stigma\nassociated with exploiting\na globally loved, critically\nendangered species.

While the Vietnamese trade in tiger\nparts is currently illegal,\nChina\u2019s decision will\ncertainly influence the\nSouth East Asian legal\natmosphere concerning\nthe commodification of\ntigers.\nThe latest development\nis only a delay in the\npossible ban reversal;\nenvironmental activists\nand conservationists must\n\u201cSupporting\ntiger and\nrhino farms\nwill stimulate\ndemand\nfor these\nproducts that\nwill certainly\nexceed the\nsupply that\nfarms are able\nto generate\u201d\nwait anxiously for further\nupdates from Beijing.\nIn this age of ecocide\nand global biodiversity\ndevastation, it is time to\nabandon the outdated and\nscientifically invalid practices in traditional medicines that are exploiting\nand driving the decline of\nendangered species.\nThe Chinese NGO\nWildAid captures the\nsentiment of many with\ntheir slogan \u201c\u6ca1\u6709\u4e70\u5356\n\u6ca1\u6709\u6740\u5bb3\u201d (\u201cWhen the\nbuying stops, the killing\ncan too\u201d).\n\u201c\u6ca1\u6709\u4e70\u5356\u6ca1\u6709\n\u6740\u5bb3 \u2013 When\nthe buying\nstops, the\nkilling can\ntoo\u201d\nGoing on in the\nworld this week\nMonday sees the beginning of the\nCOP 24 conference in Katowice,\nPoland.

I do love\nfallout; I\u2019ve\nclocked an irresponsible\nnumber of hours in 4 and\nNew Vegas over the last\nfew years. I gel with the\nart direction, I like the\nsetting and I love a good\nopen world. I, however,\nalso ardently defended\nFallout 76 when it was\nannounced. I saw the\npotential in a multiplayer\nonly fallout and was eagerly anticipating re-entering\nthe wasteland no matter\nwhat form that took.\nFinally, the game drops,\nand I find myself dumb-struck. I\u2019m not angry. I\u2019m\njust disappointed.\nFallout 76 is a frustrating game to discuss\nbecause I really want to\nlike it, and there are times\nwhen I genuinely do.\nBut there are some fundamental flaws with the\ngame, and I worry they\nmay not be fixable in post.\nLet\u2019s start by looking at\nthe good though--I want\nto give credit where its\ndue. The game is visually\nstunning; this is the best a\ncreation engine has ever\nlooked, and it pairs beautifully with the vibrant\nlandscape of atomic West\nVirginia. The game has\na warmer colour palette\nthan previous games,\nmaking the landscape\nvery inviting. It makes the\nexperience of just walking\naround fun, but we\u2019ll\ncome back to that. The\ngreat visual design carries\nover to the player custo-misation. More players\nmeans there needs to be\nvisual diversity in items\n(especially armour) in\norder for you to tell each\nother apart and express\nyourself. 76 manages to\nintegrate all these new\ndesigns pretty seamlessly\n(I especially like some of\nthe new power armours).\nThe standard combat\nmechanics are the best\nthey\u2019ve ever been in\na modern Fallout, and\nthis is good since the\nhighlight of the game is\nencountering and fighting\nthe large array of new\nand incredibly interesting\nmonster-minibosses. In\nmy time with the game,\nthese encounters were all\nfun and unique enough\nto each leave a lasting\nimpression. The design\nteam clearly had a lot of\nfun with these things and\nit shows.\nBut you knew this part\nwas coming from the title.\nThe first and most obvious\nissue is the optimisation.\nI don\u2019t care how nice\nyour car is, if you put a\n\u201cThe standard\ncombat\nmechanics\nare the best\nthey\u2019ve\never been\nin a modern\nFallout\u201d\nbroken engine in it it\u2019s not\ngoing to get us anywhere.\nThere was a no-clip documentary released about\n76\u2019s development which\nstated that the way the\ncreation engine worked\nwas not only not suited\nfor multiplayer but was\nbasically the diametric\nopposite of a multiplayer\nengine. And it shows, this\ngame runs abysmally. But\nof course it does, they\nbroke the engine so bad to\nforce in multiplayer, it\u2019s\nhonestly incredible it runs\nat all. This also means the\ngame is buggier than ever,\nand the classic Bethesda\nbugs lose their charm in a\nmultiplayer setting where\nyou can\u2019t just idly reload a\nsave when shit fucks up. I\ncould list bugs all day, but\none noteworthy one was\nan audio glitch that caused\nloud gunshots to go off\nbehind me randomly. In\na game with PVP, that is\nunacceptably bad.\nBut the problems\nextend past mere bugs\nand into design decisions.\nVATs just don\u2019t work\nnow. Given bullet time\nsimply can\u2019t work in\nmultiplayer, VATs has\nbeen re-imagined as an\nauto-targeting system.\nThis would have been\nthe right decision had it\nworked; however, without\nthe slow-motion the\ncalculations are erratic,\nespecially with the more\nfrantic monsters, leaving\nyou doomed to miss as\na 90% hit rate suddenly\ndrops to 0% as a ghoul\nwalks behind a coffee\ntable.\nUnfortunately, the\ngreatest issues with the\ngame are those made by\nchoice. The world may\nbe pretty but there just\nisn\u2019t much to do. Quest\nlines are effectively just\nfollowing post-it notes\nThen, due to scheduling,\nmy party had to disband.\nBut I still wanted to play,\nso I kept on going and\nvery quickly realised that\nthe game wasn\u2019t fun, I was\njust doing something new\nwith mates I had history\nwith.Any game can be fun\nwith friends so that\u2019s not a\nvalid defence. I enjoyed\naliens colonial marines,\nbut that\u2019s only because\nmy 3 mates and I bought\nit for \u00a33 each so we could\nriff on it in multiplayer.\nSure, it might be fun with\na group of fallout enthusiast friends, but the game\nunderneath is hollow and\nbroken. If the base under\nthe multiplayer isn\u2019t a\nwell designed game, then\nthe experience is going to\nhave no longevity. I pray\nsupport for this game is\ngood because I want it to\none day be great, but at\nthe time of writing it\u2019s just\na disappointment. If you\nwere on the fence, hold\noff for a couple of months\nand see if Bethesda make\ngood on their claims of\nheavy patching.\nHigh quality graphics but low quality gameplay // Windows Central\nSamuel Welton\nWriter\n\u201cI don\u2019t care\nhow nice your\ncar is, if you\nput a broken\nengine in it\nit\u2019s not going\nto get us\nanywhere\u201d\nmust rebuild\u201d. They\nstripped out the 2 core\ndriving forces of the\nFallout franchise, which\nyou can only do if you\nreplace them with equally\nengaging and substantial\nfeatures. Player interaction is just not enough in\nits current form. I do think\nthe idea of a huge map\nwith limited players could\nhave been the right way to\ndo it, but the interactions\naren\u2019t meaningful. PVP is\nreally easy to avoid and\neven if you do die the lack\nof permadeath removes\na lot of the bite and\ntension a survival game\nusually has. The survival\nmechanics themselves are\nserviceable, but they\u2019re\nnot trying to innovate with\nthem so they\u2019re not espe\ncially interesting. Very\nquickly most people will\ndevelop a live-and-let-live\nattitude, at which point\nother players barely factor\nin and you\u2019re left with a\nlukewarm survival game\nand a pretty but empty\nlandscape to explore.\nI really enjoyed my\ntime with Fallout 76 for\nthe first 6 hours or so.\nfrom one place to another.\nThe stories might be\ninterestingly written, but\nwithout actual direct interactions with characters,\nthey\u2019re not engaging, and\nthere is no overarching\nnarrative short of \u201cyou\n\n"

Grants for\ndisadvantaged students\nmay also be reduced,\nmaking higher education\ninaccessible for students\nfrom low-income back-grounds. As Felix wrote\nearlier this year, Imperial\nis one of the worst universities when it comes to\nrecruiting students from\nlower socioeconomic\nbackgrounds, with just\n63.5% of entrants in\n2016/17 coming from\nstate schools.\nThese considerations\nare not likely to deter stu-dents. Recent years have\nseen countless politicians\ntrying to win the student\nvote with promises about\nmaintaining or improving\nthe affordability of higher\neducation. And \u2013 as cases\nof mental illness among\nyoung people rise \u2013 the\nprospect of graduating\nwith \u00a350,000 of debt\nexacts an incalculable\ncost in terms of student\nwell-being and adds\nfurther strain to health and\nsocial care services.\nStill, the general feeling\nis that something must be\ndone. If not lower tuition\nfees, then what?\nOne alternative would\nbe the re-introduction of\nmaintenance grants, rather\nthan loans. Almost half of\nstudents struggled to pay\ntheir rent, and their mental\nhealth suffered as a result,\naccording to a recent Save\nthe Student survey. A third\nof respondents also believed that difficulties in\nmeeting their living costs\nadversely affected their\nstudies. While a return to\nmaintenance grants would\nput a drain on Treasury re-sources, the \u00a3500 million\ncost estimated by the Institute for Fiscal Studies is\nconsiderably less than the\npotential cost of lowering\ntuition fees.\nMany universities\nwould find ways to operate\nwithout a third of their\ntuition fee income.

Alas,\nI must concede defeat.\nAfter 22 years of trying,\nI will never beat my\ncrippling procrastination.\nFrom what was looking\nlike the earliest I'd ever\nget the paper done by a\nfew short hours ago to\nme sat here frantically\nwaffling once again so I\ncan send the paper off to\nprint only two hours after\nthe \"print deadline\". They\nshould have never told me\nthe print deadline was not\na firm one. That was the\nfirst mistake. As you can\nprobably tell if you are\nunfortunate enough to still\nbe reading this garbage, I\ndon't really have anything\nto say. Once again.\nThis week's issue of\nFelix sees the birth of\na new Sustainability\nSection. This section\nwill be organised by the\nEnvironmental society\nand aims to provide\nnews on the environment\n(\"Going on in the world\nthis week\"), to give a\nplatform for discussion\nand to popularise actions\nwhich members of the\nCollege community can\ntake on sustainability. If\nIm honest, I was sceptical about including the\nSustainability Section.\nOne question plagued my\nmind... is it sustainable?\n(Pardon the awful pun, it's\nlate and I'm very tired).\nHowever, members of the\nEnvironmental Society\nhave assured me that\nthere is a demand for\nthis amongst the student\nbody and there will be no\nshortage of content in the\ncoming weeks.\nIn a similar vein, this\nweek we also reported on\na student protest held by\nDivest Imperial demanding Imperial divests its\n\u00a38.9m fossil fuel holdings.\nThis protest was picked up\n2\nby the lovely journalists\nover at The Guardian and\nthey did a wonderful job\nofhighlighting just how\namateurish my attempts at\nNews articles are.\nIn other news, Tuesday\nsees Imperial host its\nfirst joint event with The\nTimes. As reported in last\nweek's Felix, Imperial and\nThe Times have launched\na collaboration which sees\nstaff and students receive\na year-long free digital\nsubscription to The Times\nand Sunday Times. Tuesday's launch event, \"What\nthe Hell is Going on?\"\npromises to be a riveting\naffair, hosted by political\nsatirist Matt Chorley. Universities minister, Sam\nGyimah, will also be in attendance and there will be\nfree food and drink.

This expansion was only possible\nunder the competent reign\nof Ashurbanipal, youngest\nson of Esarhaddon.\nSo how can a man\nreign over such a massive\nempire? Compared to his\npredecessors, Ashurbanipal was more than just a\nruthless ruler - although\nhe certainly was that,\nfearlessly impaling lions\nand slaying his enemies,\nbe they a neighbouring\nrebellious king or his\nown older brother. The\nKing of the Neo-Assyrian\nEmpire was renowned\nfor his mind, of which he\nwas proud, as you will\nnotice on the stonework\ndisplayed at the exhibi-tion, where Ashurbanipal\nis presented with a spear\nin his hand and - more\nsignificantly - a stylus\nbehind his belt.\nAshurbanipal\u2019s passion\nfor writing led him to establish The Royal Library,\nlocated in the capital of\nAssyria, Nineveh, holding\nover 30,000 tablets consisting of diverse texts\nfrom legal documents\nto literary compositions\nincluding the Epic of\nGilgamesh.Avast number\nof these tablets are present\nat the exhibition due to an\nunfortunate (or fortunate)\noccurrence. During the\nfall of Nineveh, an event\nrecorded in Greek history\nand described in the Bible,\nmany of these tablets were\nbaked in the great fire that\nburned down the city, thus\npreserving them to this\nday.\nIn this exhibition, the\nBritish Museum presents\nthe life of Ashurbanipal\nthrough over 250 exhibits\nfrom museums all around\nthe world. From stone\ncarvings to jewels, statues,\nand tablets, some of which\nhave not been shown to\nthe public eye in the past\n15 years. The exhibition\ntakes you slowly through\nthe history of Assyria\nbefore, during and after\nthe reign of its greatest\nKing, Ashurbanipal.\nhas cleverly placed\nprojectors to light up bits\nand pieces of the artefact,\nwith accompanying sound\neffects, while projecting\na description of the events\nin the carving nearby,\ncreating a cohesive story.\nI am Ashurbanipal:\nking of the world, king of\nAssyria is more than just\nan exhibition portraying\nsome long forgotten\nhistory. At the end of the\nexhibition you will also be\npresented with a surprise:\na video message from the\nwomen who are partaking\nin the Iraq Emergency\nHeritage Management\nTraining Scheme.\nMost of the exhibits have\ncome from Nineveh, Iraq,\na historical site that has\nseen appalling destruction\nat the hand of the Islamic\nState in 2015. Currently\nthe British museum team\nwith the Iraqi Board of\nAntiquities and Heritage\nare rescuing the archaeological treasures from the\naffected sites.\nSplendour and might,\nthis exhibition presents\nthe peak of a civilisation\nthe history of which\nremains unknown to\nmany. Be ready to transport yourself more than\n2,000 in the past as the\nKing has left many stories\nbehind worthy to be\npassed down in time, so\ncome and listen to them\npassing through the exhibition which resembles\na well written narrative\nwith picturesque and\ncaptivating artefacts.\nThe British Museum presents a narrative of the life of Ashurbanipal, a ruthless ruler with a passion for writing.\nHunting lions and building libraries... an interesting mix of hobbies // Flickr\nARTS\nCatalina Costenco\nArts Writer\nWhere?

Sony announces that they\nwon\u2019t be attending the 2019 convention\nIn what seems to be a bizzare decision by Sony executivies the company is backing out of the major gaming\nconvention E3 and their own convention \u2018Playstation Experience\u2019\nGames\nConnor Winzar\nGames Editor\nT\nhe Electronic\nEntertainment\nExpo (E3) is a\nmassive gaming\nconvention aimed at\nshowcasing upcoming\ncontent from major developers and publishers. With\nits initial start-up being\nin 1995, it has continued\nsince with thriving attendance and popularity. Just\nthe mention of E3 within\nthe gaming community\nis enough to get gamers\neagerly anticipating the\npotential announcements.\nSo why on Earth is Sony\nnot attending E3 2019?\nCould it be that Sony isn\u2019t\nable to afford E3, or is this\njust beginning of the nails\nthat will soon be hammered into E3\u2019s coffin?\nInterested? Well, let\u2019s get\nright into it!\nWhy is Sony not\nattending? :\nLet me start right off the\nbat by saying that Sony is\nby no means experiencing\nfinancial issues; in fact, the\namount of PS4\u2019s they\u2019ve\nsold is a whopping 2.5\ntimes that of Microsoft\u2019s\nXbox One. With a clear\nlandslide victory in this\ngeneration\u2019s console\nwars, there\u2019s no chance\nthat Sony is having money\nissues. So what could it be\nthen? And why are fans\nconcerned? Well, Sony\nseems to be going cold\nturkey on announcements\nand releases, not only\nare they not attending E3\nthey\u2019ve even cancelled\ntheir own convention,\nPlaystation Experience\n(originally planned for\nthis December), despite\nits four-year uninterrupted\nrun. What could Sony\npossibly be thinking?\nI\u2019m glad to inform you\nthat Sony hasn\u2019t gone\ncompletely off the rails;\nhowever, they seem\nto be taking a new\ndirection. Recent press\nannouncements suggest\nthe company is going for a\ndifferent approach regarding both their PR tactics\nand interaction with their\nfanbase. An example of a\npast success they had in\nvarying such tactics was\nthe \u201cRoad to Greatness\u201d\ncampaign. The campaign\nentailed a semi-truck con\u201cSony is going\nfor a different\napproach\nregarding\nboth their PR\ntactics and\ninteraction\nwith their\nfanbase\u201d\n\u201cE3 has set the\ngold standard\nas a platform\nfor the\nrevealing of\nbig titles and\nIPs\u201d\ntaining VR stations and\nPS4\u2019s setting up one-day\nshowcases and tryouts,\nwhilst being driven from\none state to another across\nthe US. The campaign\nhas worked surprisingly\nwell, with a large amount\nof support from the\nfanbase as well as a great\namount of exposure to the\nwonders of VR; and all its\nmotion sickness.\nSony may also be\ntaking a tactical approach\nto this year and ate simply\nreserving their IPs for\nthe upcoming year; given\nthe fact they\u2019ve already\nannounced this year\u2019s\nheavy hitters: Last of Us\nPart 2, Death Stranding\nand Ghosts of Tsushima.\nBusiness wise it would be\nnonsensical to suddenly\nmask over their other\nannouncements with\neven more announce-ments, given how that\nwould affect sales. There\ncould also be the other\ndepressing possibility that\nSony has run out of IPs,\nand they just don\u2019t have\nanything for E3, which\nis a rather anticlimactic\nreason. Either way, E3\nis quite the expensive\nand resource demanding\nconvention, so it would\nbe reasonable for Sony to\nmake the cost-effective\ndecision of not turning up\nto E3, given that they have\ntheir own convention in\n2019 and pending news\nof the PS5. There may be\nhappy days for Sony, but\nthat may not be the case\nfor E3. In what seems to be\na growing trend, more and\nmore games developers\nare making their own con-ventions, with Microsoft,\nEA and Nintendo being\nexamples of this. Which\nbegs the question, should\nwe be worried about E3?\nIs this E3\u2019s curtain\ncall? :\nWith so many different\ngaming conventions\naround, including\nGamescon, PAX and\nQuakecon, how is it\npossible that E3 is still\ncoping? Even looking\nat the attendance of the\nconventions E3 seems\nto be in the danger zone\nand not even in a good\n\u2018Archer\u2019 way. With Pax\nEast having an attendance of 80,000+ people\nand Gamescon raking\nin the ticket money with\n370,000 people, E3 just\ndoesn\u2019t seem to compare\nwith only 69,000 people\nattending this year\u2019s\nconvention. But that\u2019s the\nthing, this is E3\u2019s highest\nattendance yet! So how\nexactly has E3 stayed\nafloat for so long? The\nanswer -- the legacy and\ndigital domination that\nE3 holds. Ask any regular\ngamer which convention\nthey watch to hear the\nannouncements of new\ngames and hands down\nthey\u2019ll say E3. Gamescon\nmay have the numbers,\nbut it occupies a different\nmarket that\u2019s focused on\nproviding people with the\nopportunity to actually\nplay games that are soon\nto be released, as opposed\nto revealing games that\nare going to come out.\nThey occupied such a\nmarket simply because E3\nhas set the gold standard\nas a platform for the\nrevealing of big titles and\nIPs. With rising attendance it doesn\u2019t seem like\nE3 will be experiencing\nany hardship. Regardless\nof having their own convention both Nintendo\nand Microsoft still show\nup to E3, because it\u2019s\nthat potent as a platform\nfor news coverage. Sony\nmay be missing out but\nthey are saving their top\nshelf material for later as\nwell as their money. Who\nknows what will happen\nto E3 in the coming years,\nbut it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll stick\naround... as long as there\nisn\u2019t the improbable\ndisaster that is everyone\npacking their bags and\nleaving.\nKai Lawrence\nWriter\nSony 2018 E3 Conference // Spidersweb\n\n"

In\nthe new RSC production\nof Romeo and Juliet,\nShakespeare\u2019s Italian city\nhas been built in modern\nday London\u2019s image. We\ndon\u2019t have to suspend\nour disbelief too much;\nthis story of streets where\na misjudged remark is\nanswered by a flash of a\nknife is sadly not all that\nunfamiliar.\nIt\u2019s not just the\nwardrobe that Whyman\nhas updated, but the\nnarrative too. The programme calls it \u201cqueering\nthe pitch\u201d; in practice,\ngenders are a bit more\nfluid, queer themes a little\nmore explicit . Benvolio\u2019s\nlove for Romeo is more\novertly romantic than\nhistorical adaptations\nsuggest, though even\nhere it is painfully silent,\nburdened by layers of\nrepression and heteronor-mativity. Charlotte Josephine plays Mercutio as\na glittering loud-mouthed\nseventeen-year old girl\nconstantly spoiling for\na fight. Josephine is\nluminousintherole,filling\nthe stage with tremendous\nenergy and appropriately\nmercurial physicality.\nIn first couple of acts\nshe is larger than life,\nbrimming with bravado\nwhich quickly collapses\nin her dying moments.\nJosephine with poignancy\nshows Mercutio for who\nshe really is \u2013 angry yes,\nbut also impossibly young\nand scared.\nThe great strength of\nWhyman\u2019s adaptation is\nits ability to strip back\nthe trappings of the Elizabethan English to reveal\nits principal characters\nas the children they are,\nonly just blossoming into\nadulthood. Here, Romeo\nand Juliet, Benvolio and\nMercutio, are kids full\nof their own importance,\nkids sure of their im-mortality, kids forced to\ngrow up too fast in brutal,\nviolent ways.\nSenseless rage and\npointless acts of retribu-tion, not star-crossed love\nare at the heart of this\nproduction. The menacing\nglint of sharp blades is\never-present. The stage\nhas been constructed by\ndesigner Tom Piper as a\nbrutalist concrete mauso-leum, cold and vast. In the\nworld of these teenagers,\nthe pretty things \u2013 the\nstrings of twinkling lights\nthat descend in place of\nstars during the balcony\nscenes, or the huge lush\nwall of ferns that acts as\na backdrop for the Friar\u2019s\nhome \u2013 are fragile, acutely\ntransient.\nThe smash bang of the\nelectronica-inspired score\npunctuates this punchy\nadaptation, but for all\nits modern flourishes,\nthe adaptation is still\nclassically good. The\npassages that will for\nmany in the audience be\nfamiliar, never feel trite.\nThe hugely charismatic\nBarry Gill is excellent as\nRomeo, capturing both a\nrogueish impulsivity and\nflashes of loving sensitivity in his performance.\nKaren Fishwick as Juliet\nis equally good. The\nyoung actors are ably supported by a talented roster\nof castmates playing the\nolder roles, with Ishia\nBennison as Nurse and\nAndrew French as the\nFriar standing out as\nscene-stealing performers.\nThere is diversity of\ngender, skin-tone, experience and accent in the\nbig speaking roles and\nwhile this is commend-able, what is even better\nis that none of this is\nsuperfluous. Whyman\u2019s\nproduction without pretension or fanfare illuminates this play of passion\nand violence for our age.\nThe result is a wonderful\nproduction but one that is\nrather more classical than\nit would first appear.\nWalk Swiftly and With Purpose: a debut to remember\nT\nhree Sisters\u2019 production company,\nbrainchild of\nSiofra, Grainne, and\nCara Dromgoole, immediately throws us into\nthe world of a group of\nschoolgirls on the cusp\nof adulthood. Eve, Lana,\nRobbie, and Misha,\ndespite the deep and\npowerful themes they\nexplore together, ultimately represent the unflinching devotion and\nlove between friends,\nall the way through the\nchaotic teenage years\nthat resonate with us all.\nThey\u2019re hilariously re-latable, albeit a bit pre-tentious, living sheltered\nlives in the comfort of an\nall-girls private school.\nWe meet them at the\nexact moment they suddenly encounter real-life\nproblems and have to\nlearn to deal with them.\nNo longer existing in\ntheir fantasies of what\nadulthood is, they realise it may not be all it\u2019s\ncracked up to be.\nWhen I read that this\nis Siofra Dromgoole\u2019s\nfirst live play as a writer,\nI was surprised. Her inexperience is unnoticeable,\nwith a script that artfully\ncombines witty repartee\nbetween the girls with\nserious and, at times,\ndeeply unsettling scenes\nbetween Mr Hughes\nand Misha \u2013 teacher and\nstudent, as well as sudden\nintense monologues\ndirected towards the\naudience by each charac-ter. This rapid switching\nbetweennaturallyflowing,\nlight-hearted conversation\nand emotional, vulnerable\nsoliloquys to the audience\nis a bold choice \u2013 done\npoorly it has the potential to derail the entire\nplay \u2013 but somehow the\ntransitions are effortless,\nin spite of the abrupt\nchanges of tone, most\nlikely thanks to the excellent direction of Imy\nWyatt Corner. It elevates\nthe play from simply\nbeing four somewhat privileged girls talking about\ntypical teenage troubles,\nto something much more\nthought-provoking.\nThe extraordinary\npotential of the all-female\ncrew behind this production is unprecedented;\nthe way I see it, the sky is\nthe limit considering the\nresounding success of this\nplay. I only wish it were\nlonger than 50 minutes\n\u2013 with exceptional performances from rising stars\nwith great chemistry, I\ncould have easily continued watching the lives of\nthese characters unfold\nfor another hour.\nUnfortunately, by\nthe time of this article\npublishing, the show will\nno longer be showing,\nbut keep a watchful eye\nout for the next Three\nSisters production \u2013 I can\nassure you it is not to be\nmissed!

Keith\nAllen plays her foil as\nBeth\u2019s crude, down-to-earth husband. Ostensibly\nhaving a conversation, an\nunbridgeable gulf yawns\nbetween the two. Who\nare they really talking to?\nEach is utterly alone in\ntheir own recollections,\nand the darkness in the\nstory encroaches slowly,\nbefore we know it.\nGrieg and Allen in\nLandscape bring out\nPinter\u2019s masterful ability\nto alternate between comic\nand tragic. Something\nwill be funny, and all of a\nsudden, without warning,\na character will let something slip, and we see that\nit is actually intensely sad.\nAnother standout example\nis the short sketch Girls,\nwith Tom Edden as a\nprofessor relating a story\nabout \u201cgirls who want to\nbe spanked\u201d. Likewise\nwith comedian Lee Evans\u2019\nbrilliant rendition of\nMonologue, which Evans\ncame out of retirement to\nact in. Chatting animatedly to an empty chair, the\nprotagonist of Monologue\nis trapped in old memories\nand confabulations. But\nwith his jaunty demean-our and spring-loaded\nmannerisms, Evans brings\ntears to our eyes \u2013 whether\nfrom laughter or sadness\nI\u2019m not quite sure. We are\nswung from frank hilarity\nto aching sorrow in less\nthan a heartbeat.\nA great deal of what\nhappens in a Pinter play\nhappens between the lines,\nbehind the scenes. What\nwe see is merely the tip\nof the iceberg. Scratching\nthe surface of loneliness.\nWhether it\u2019s a man having\na conversation with an\nabsent friend, or a professor inventing a fantasy\nabout a girl he\u2019s seen once\non the street. And yet\nthere is tenderness to be\nfound there, too. In Night,\na man and a woman argue\nabout the details of their\nfirst rendezvous \u2013 was\nit against railings, or\non a bridge? Each has\ntheir own version of that\nmagical first meeting,\nbut in the end, it doesn\u2019t\nmatter. Evans and Meera\nSyal bring this beautiful\nlittle piece to life with\ntruly believable affection.\nHuge props to Jamie\nLloyd for curating these\neleven plays. Despite\nspanning almost fifty\nyears of Pinter\u2019s work,\nthey flow smoothly in\nthis frankly astounding\nproduction. Soutra Gilmour\u2019s versatile revolving\nset, illuminated by a\nsingular lightbulb, whirls\nus seamlessly from one\nscene to the next. With\nthis remarkable cast of\nactors, we see the shades\nof emotional subtlety in\neach piece, how the nature\nof memory is wholly\nsubjective. This is Pinter\nat his finest.\nPinter Four: Not quite hitting the standard\nI\nf you had taken the\nadvice that ended\nour five-star review\nof Pinter Two three\nweeks ago, you would\nhave rushed to buy tickets\nto one of the shows in\nthis series. Pinter Three,\nalso reviewed in this\nissue, lives up to this but\nin Pinter Four we find\nthat not all scripts are\ncreated equal and when\nthe balance of plot and\ndialogue are misjudged,\nboth playing and directing\nbecomes a minefield.\nThe first of the two\nplays, Moonlight, struggles to find its tone. It is\nfundamentally an exploration of death and family.\nBesides the haunting monologues from wide-eyed\nand moonlight-cloaked\nBridget (Isis Hainsworth)\nthat begin and end the\nplay, the stage is centered\naround the bed of Andy\n(Robert Glenister) as he\nlies dying. The curtains\nremain half-open and the\nboxed set, complete with\nverbally-sparring married\ncouple Andy and Bel\n(Brie Brennan), initially\nfeels like a slightly dated\nmulti camera sitcom. \u2013\ncomplete with various\nfamily members and affiliates crossing through the\nstage, all supposedly in\ndifferent places or times.\nTherearesomestandout\nmoments. Janie Dee\ndelivers a number of fantastic speeches as Maria,\nex-lover of both Andy and\nBel, fully embracing the\ncharacteristic snappiness\nof Pinter\u2019s writings. Once\nup and running, most\nof the issues disappear.\nGlenister is captivating\nonce Andy shifts from\nnonchalance and anger\nto crisis and collapse.\nThe two brothers, Jake\nand Fred (Al Weaver and\nDwane Walcott), who\nappear as cut-scenes, by\nhalfway are dealing out\nlyrical and absurd dialog\nin perfect Pinteresque\nfashion. It\u2019s just a shame\nthat it doesn\u2019t begin so.\nNight School, the\nsecond play, shifts the\nfocus to the theme of\ndeception in everyday\nlife. Still filled with Pinterness, this play doesn\u2019t\nshine for its plot. Walter\n(Al Weaver), fresh out of\nprison, tries, exaggerating\nhis crimes, to seduce\nSally (Jessica Barden), a\nPE teacher, supposedly\nstudying at night school\nbut in fact working at a\nnightclub. Solto (Glen-ister again), a stingy and\nnarcissistic ex-criminal,\nwho fakes being a poor\npensioner to evade taxes,\nenters the competition for\nSally\u2019s hand. Within this\nbland frame Walter\u2019s two\naunties uplift the mood\nwith their peanut-gallery\ncommentary, giving some\nPinteresque flavour to the\nwhole situation.\nFortunately the Jamie\nLloyd Company succeeded in turning what could\nhave been a forgettable\nexperience, into an opportunity for experimentation\nwith minimalist staging.\nOriginally conceived\nfor television, its script\ndoesn\u2019t describe much of\nthe setting. The director\nEd Stambollouian undertakes this challenge with\nsome interesting and risky\nstylistique decisions. On\nstage is the bare bones of\nwhat could be a room: a\ngargantuan cubic frame\nis at its centre, creating\nvarious layers where the\naction takes place. The\nbrilliant Abbie Finn,\nalwayspresentintheback-ground, plays on a drum\nkit, beating the action,\nand giving a hysteric twist\nto the transitions between\nthe scenes. Jon Clark\u2019s\nlighting design is mag-nificent, bringing into life\nthe actors\u2019 actions, and\nperfectly marrying the\ndrum\u2019s rhythms. Stambollouian successfully\namalgamates contemporary and more traditional\ntheatre, bringing some\nrefreshing courage to the\nWest End.\nPinter Four is definitely\nan enjoyable show. Maybe\nnot as life-changing as\nothers, but nonetheless\nthe Jamie Lloyd Company\ndoesn\u2019t fail to confirm\nitself as one of the most\ncurious experiences now\navailable on the market.\nTamsin Grieg in Landscape// Marc Brenner\nARTS\nFRIDAY, 23RD\nNOVEMBER, 2018 FELIX\n23\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nClaire Chan\nArts Editor\nWhere?

The nine-piece\ninstrumental collective,\nhailing from Amsterdam,\nhas a sound that lies\nsomewhere in the middle\nof jazz, afrobeat (I\u2019m talking your uncle\u2019s favourite\nFela) and funk. The group\nhas been steadily making a\nname for themselves since\nforming in 2009, playing\neverywhere from smaller\nvenues like the Duke of\nCumberland in Whitstable\nto renowned festivals like\nPinkpop, North Sea Jazz\nand Glastonbury. Having\nspent their down time\nbetween albums scoring\nthe stage production of\nThe Jungle Book, the\nboys descended on the\nsold out Jazz Cafe last\nFriday, to celebrate the\nlaunch of their 5th album,\nLivingstone, having\npreviously teased only a\nhandful of new tracks at\ntheir last London show in\nMarch.\nOpening the show\nwith an incredible solo\nfrom trumpeter Bo Floor,\nit seems apparent that\nwith each album, their\nsound has become more\nrefined and the multicultural influences are more\nreadily heard. This album\nis undoubtedly more\nglobal and anthemic, with\nsongs like \u201cThe Fog\u201d,\nand \u201cSpectacles\u201d, parts 1\nand 2, sounding like they\ncould be taken straight off\na spy thriller soundtrack.\nOverall, this new album\ntakes on a decidedly more\ndance vibe than its predecessor The Traveller.\nThat being said, the\nspirit of what makes a\nJungle By Night show a\nJungle By Night show\nwas still there: with\neach member getting\ntheir moment to shine\nwith solos, dismantled\ntrombones, djembe\nbreakdowns, and more\njumping than is probably\nadvisable.\nWhilst taking a quick\nbreather to chat, trombonist Ko Zandvliet explained\nthat they wanted to capture\nthe essence and the heat\nof the previous Dutch\nsummer, even going so far\nas to record ambient bird\nsounds at the countryside\nhouse where the album\nwas made, on songs such\nas \u201cHangmat\u201d. So if the\nplan was to make a hot\nalbum, a party album, a\nget-up-and-dance album,\nthen judging by the crowd\nthat night, they more than\nsucceeded.\nThe band closed out the\nshow with a new interpretation of their thundering\nclassic \u201cAttila,\u201d proving\nonce again why they\u2019re\nworth seeing again and\nagain. Go alone, go with\na crew, either way you\u2019ll\nhave a great time, because\ntheir infectious energy\nmakes Jungle By Night an\nact not to be missed.\nJungle By Night is under no circumstances an act to be missed. // V2 Records\nISSUE 1706\nFELIX\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n18\nMUSIC\nTobi Ampapa\nMusic Writer\nSupport Artist: Project\nKarnak.

She said that it is\n\u201can album where I have\nstarted to work with my\npsyche, trying to access a\nlevel of my consciousness\nthat I was not aware of\nbefore.\u201d\nAnd indeed, it reads\nas her most personal and\ndiverse album to date.\nThe album begins on\nwhat could first appear\nas its conclusion. Marie\nDavidson aligns, one after\nthe other, remarks and\nquestions that could be\n(and probably are) made\nby her fans. On a reasonably chaotic background\nshe asks \u201cso, frankly, is\nthis album about taking\nrisks?\u201d and between lines\nthat insist on the lack of\nhumanity that some fans\nmight have towards her,\nshe repeats to herself\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d. This\nseems to be what this\nalbum is about. It does\ninvolve taking risks but it\nis mostly a self reflective\nalbum where Marie takes\nus on a subconscious\npoppy dream.\nThrough the diverse\ntrack listing she alternates\nbetween more fun and\nfunky sounds like in \u2018So\nRight\u2019 (the type of song\nthat you dance to at a\nhouse party and to which\nyou don\u2019t pay much atten-tion), and chaotic tracks\nwhere the lyrics barely\nmake any sense anymore,\nand screechy electronic\nsamples that make you\nwant to curl up in ball\nlike in \u2018The Tunnel\u2019. This\ntrack features French and\nEnglish in what appears\nto be disarticulated self\nreflections where she talks\nabout \u2018The Tunnel\u2019, a\ndistressing dark environment in which she needs\nto dig by herself to come\nout stronger. The power\nof this track lies in the\nstrength of the lyrics that\nsuddenly make sense\nagain when she seems\nto gain back lucidity and\nsays in French (translated)\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t understood that\nI can\u2019t love if I don\u2019t\nlove myself / love is not\na reward you get after\nhaving suffered / love is\na gift\u201d. This spills out in\nbetween chaotic sentences that don\u2019t quite make\nsense (although her lyrics\nare so pictorial, one still\nneeds to build their own\ninterpretation) and these\nwords stand out crystal\nclear and strike as a punch\nin the stomach.\nBut don\u2019t let me give\nyou the wrong impres-sion, both the strength\nand weakness of Working\nClass Woman is the mix of\ntracks that can be as fun as\n\u2018Work it\u2019 (a weird poppy\nsong where she acclaims\nhard work and self love in\na funny and frankly quite\nsexy fashion) and as deep\nas \u2018The Tunnel\u2019 or \u2018The\nPsychologist\u2019 (of which\nthe topic remains left to in-terpretation).

Striking a balance between tenacity and tenderness, her new material stikes a chord with audiences.\nC\nourtney Barnett\nhas been crafting\nwitty, mid-paced\nindie gems for\nhalf a decade; on a mild\nWednesday evening\nshe treated Brixton to a\nwell-deserved outing of\nher latest material.\nAfter an all-Australian\nwarm up roster, featuring the three-guitar\njangle-juggernaut that is\nRolling Blackouts Coastal\nFever (think Interpol\nmeets Cream), Courtney\nBarnett took to the stage\nin front of a mostly mid-dle-aged crowd at the O2\nAcademy.\nBarnett\u2019s latest album\nmay brim with the same\nhigh-octane energy as\n2015\u2019s Sometimes I Sit\nand think\u2026, but as the\noozing groove of \u2018Hopefulessness\u2019 emerged from\na cacophony of feedback;\nit became apparent that\nthere was more to her\nwork than a casual Spotify\nlisten would suggest.\nBarnett and her cohort\nwere there not for the\nvain theatrics, but for\nthe music. Each member\nfocused largely on their in-strument, coaxing out the\nmost that each song could\ngive, while four-thousand\nheads bobbed along. The\nresult was a powerful\nhaze that simmered and\nbubbled beneath the cute\nmelodies and tongue in\ncheek wordplay for which\nBarnett has made herself\na name. In instrumental\nbreaks the band\u2019s energy\nboiled over, wringing the\nmost out of their simple\narrangements.\nMany crowd members\nwere already mouthing\nalong as Barnett crooned\n\u201ctake your broken heart\n/ turn it into art\u2026\u201d. Her\nband, feeding off the\nenergy that filled the\nacademy, remained effortlessly cool, while eliciting\nincreasing excitement\nfrom its spectators. Roars,\nwhoops and whistles\nwould erupt as Barnett\nstumbled her way across\nthe stage, bent double over\nher guitar after delivering\nanother unflinching verse.\nHer vocal performance\nwas strong throughout\nthe night, capturing the\nsame character and power\nfound on her studio cuts.\nMidway through the\nset, opener Laura Jean\nreturned to the stage to\nprovide sax and vocals\n(uncannily similar to\nthose of Courtney herself)\nfor a cover of the Go-Betweens\u2019 \u2018Streets of your\ntown\u2019; another homage\nto the Milk! record label\nowner\u2019s Aussie roots.\nBarnett might have been\nbetter suited to cover one\nof her peers - Julien Baker,\nor long-time partner Jen\nCloher perhaps \u2013 as it\nbecame evident that the\ncrowd was not particularly familiar with the track,\nand a lull ensued.\nPassion from the\ncrowd quickly returned as\nBarnett launched back into\nher own material. \u2018I\u2019m\nnot your mother, I\u2019m not\nyour bitch\u2019, the audience\nbellowed with relish, the\nraucous anti-snob anthem\nclearly a fan favourite.\n\u2018Nameless, Faceless\u2019\nand its effortless handling\nof internet critics and\ngender politics in one\nfell swoop was another\nchoice cut. Ms. Barnett\u2019s\nimpossibly quotable\nlyrics, \u201cMen are scared\nthat women will laugh at\nthem / women are scared\nthat men will kill them\u201d\nand \u201cI could eat a bowl of\nalphabet soup / and spit\nout better words than you\u201d\nwere certainly not lost on\nher adoring audience.\nFriends exchanged\nknowing grins at each\nlilting one-liner.\nAfter a sublimely\nchosen setlist, parading\nthe singer\u2019s most beloved\ntunes, the crunching riff\nof \u2018Pedestrian at Best\u2019\npushed Brixton into the\nbeautiful chaos of dance.\nNothing was left to be\nproved for Barnett and her\nband, they had managed\nto add something beyond\nwords to what was already\na set of very strong songs.\nReaders would be advised\nto catch Barnett and her\ncrowd next time they pass\nthrough London.\nKevin Parker, is that you? // Wikimedia\nMUSIC\nMiles Gulliford\nMusic Writer\nSupport Artist: Rolling\nBlackouts Coastal Fever;\nLaura Jean.

    "content": "Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Bad Storytelling\nFilm Editor Aidan Chan sat through the latest film in the Harry Potter franchise.\nI\nwalked into the\ncinema with mild\napprehension. I\nknew that the critical\nreception was particularly\nunfavorable, yet I had\nhoped that this would be a\nPirates of the Caribbean:\nDead Man\u2019s Chest scenar-io, where the film would\nstill be immensely fun to\nwatch. After two hours\nof sitting and hoping for\nthe best, I came out of\nthe cinema, defeated.\nFantastic Beasts: The\nCrimes of Grindelwald\n(Fantastic Beasts 2), is\na complete mess of a\nfilm. The Harry Potter\nfranchise has finally lived\nlong enough to see itself\nbecome the villain.\nFantastic Beasts 2 is\ndirected by David Yates,\nand stars an ensemble\ncast of Eddie Redmayne,\nKatherine Waterston, Zo\u00eb\nKravitz, Johnny Depp\nand many, many more.\nHowever, the bomb that\ndestroys the film is J. K.\nRowling\u2019s horrid screen-play. It is actually quite\nmagical that a film can\nbe so boring with around\nten separate subplots\nprogressing simultaneously on screen (I am not\nexaggerating; you can\ncount them if you want).\nIt is like watching Game\nof Thrones, but instead\nof ten hour seasons, you\nget a two hour film; And\ninstead of interesting,\nnuanced plotting, you get\nstories that go absolutely\nnowhere and are completely pointless.\nThe more separate\nplots a film has, the less\ntime each plot gets. And\nin a film like Fantastic\nBeasts 2, each storyline\nis assigned roughly 12\nto 13 minutes of screen-time. And so, instead\nof self-contained and\nfully-realised stories and\ncharacter arcs, we get ten\nhalf-baked and lukewarm\nplots ranging from soapy\nmelodrama, to misunderstandings that are more\nsuitable in a 90s sitcom\u2014\neach of which fails to\nallow any emotional\nattachment. At the end,\nI did not care about any\nof the characters or their\nstruggles. Any tension\npresented felt manufac-tured, underdeveloped\n\u201cThe Harry\nPotter\nfranchise has\nfinally lived\nlong enough\nto see itself\nbecome the\nvillain\u201d\nand inconsequential\nbecause the film had to\nrush off elsewhere to cater\nto another subplot. I did\nnot care about Newt and\nTina\u2019s forced romance, or\nCredence\u2019s quest to find\nhis origin. Even when\nHedwig\u2019s Theme blasted\nthrough the cinema\nspeakers and the iconic\nHogwarts castle appeared\nin the distance, I did not\nfind an ounce of excitement within me, because\nI was so exhausted by the\nfilm.\nPlot twists are one of\nthe defining aspects of the\nHarry Potter series, and\nRowling migrated this\ntradition to the Fantastic\nBeasts franchise. The\n\u201cCredence is the Obscurial\u201d twist is understandable\nin the first film. But in\nthis one, the plot twists\nare verging on absurdity.\nI have heard many people\npraise the final twist of the\nfilm on social media, so\nI was relatively excited\nabout whatever surprise\nthat might be. However,\nthat twist proves to be one\nof the most laughable and\nridiculous moments of the\nentire film. These reveals\nworked in the Harry\nPotter films because there\nare carefully placed breadcrumbs that hint towards\nthe twist. However, the\ntwist in Crimes of Grindelwald are unearned and\nI have never rolled my\neyes harder.\nWith the departure of\nany coherent story struc-ture, the nostalgic magic\nthat is consistently present\nin the Harry Potter series\nalso evaporated complete-ly. The necessity of saying\nspells out loud continues\nto be entirely arbitrary.\nThe whimsy and innovations of the previous\ninstalments are gone,\ninstead we get more secret\nelevators, more moving\nstatues, more passageways disguised as walls,\nmore random spells that\ndo things Muggles can do\nequally well (like strapping people into a chair) -Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald // IMDb\nISSUE 1706\nFELIX\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n11\n\u201cThe actors\nmight be\nthe only\nredeeming\nfactor of this\nfilm.

When a\nmagic-denying Marvel\nflick felt more magical\nthan a franchise built\nupon Harry Potter, you\nknow something has gone\nwrong.\nThe actors might be\nthe only redeeming factor\nof this film. They tried\ntheir best to make use of\nthe very little screen-time\nthey were assigned. Ezra\nMiller had moments of\nbrilliance, Johnny Depp\ndominated each frame he\nwas in and Jude Law is\ncharismatic as a compassionate Albus Dumbledore. The moments that\nhint at the complicated relationship between Dumbledore and Grindelwald\nare genuinely affecting,\nbut the flashes of sincerity\nare quickly replaced by\nmore poorly presented\nstories. Other aspects of\nthe film, including generic\nCGI battles, uninspired\ndirection and abrupt tonal\nshifts (far too often does\nthe film randomly cut\nfrom a comedic moment\nto Grindelwald ominously\ndeclaring his evil plans)\ndo nothing to save this\nfilm from being part of\nthe \u201cunnecessary sequel\u201d\ngang.\nThe credits rolled and I\nlooked at the list of talents\ninvolved in the film.

Either\nthat, or she just did not\ncare. In a film without\nbeasts or crimes, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of\nGrindelwald is the quintessential filler episode.\nIt is time for Rowling\nto let go of her ego and\nhire a real screenwriter to\npolish and untangle her\nunintelligible storylines,\nso that this franchise can\nreach the potential it is\ncapable of.\n\n"

If the\nmelodic, legato lines of\nVerdi\u2019s arias are a meaningful tribute to this diva\u2019s\nstyle of singing, none of\nthe cast could quite compare to her world-famous\nquality.\nThe opera is structured\nin a prologue and three\nacts and tells the story of\na Genoese corsair who\nis elected Doge by the\npeople. After twenty-five\nyears, his long-lost illegitimate daughter is found,\nadopted by her unsuspecting actual granddad,\nand falls in love with the\nson of his greatest enemy.\nNobleman and plebeians\nweave their way through\nthe convoluted political\nscene of the city, rebel,\nenvy, commit treachery\nand reconcile, up to a\ntragic finale. Care was\ntaken to show the passing\nof time: singers returned\nfrom the \u2018twenty-five\nyears later\u2019 interlude with\nvisibly whiter hair.\nFor those who do not\nspeak Italian, subtitles are\nprovided. Still, it is hard to\nfollow the action at times,\nparticularly in duets or\ntrios, as captions do not\nclearly mark the transition\nfrom one character\u2019s line\nto another\u2019s. And one\ncan\u2019t suppress the feeling\nof some details being lost\nin translation, as often\nlong lines are translated to\nonly a few English words.\nGabriele Adorno earned\nthe audience applause\nwith his solo aria, and\nFerruccio Furlanetto as\nJacopo Fiesto impressed\nwith his consistently solid\nperformance, always\nsounding clearly and\nlouder than the orchestra.\nThe anonymous and\noften forgotten cast also\ndeserves praise: every\nchorus moment brought\nlife to the stage, bursts of\naction contrasting with\noperatic, frozen-in-time\nsections. Their off-stage\nlines had a dark, ghostly\nfeeling that overall contributed to the intensity of\nthe drama. Musically, the\norchestra was beautiful\nand precise, supporting the scene without\nbecoming the protagonist.\nIn terms of collective per-formance, the full section\nin the council chambers is\nunforgettable, involving\nspectacular sword fights,\nincredible coordination,\nalternating arias, ensembles and choruses,\nin an exciting crescendo\nof dramatic tension and\nexhilarating music.\nW\nhat if I\nasked you\nwhat the\nmost popular book ever written\nwas? Off the top of your\nhead. Think fast. Now\nyou can feel smug if you\nthought the Bible, and\neven smugger if you got\nShakespeare in second but\nwhat about third? Now\nwe can quibble about\nfigures but why don\u2019t you\ntake my word for it or, if\nyou saw the same Reddit\npost, Reddit\u2019s word for it.\nPublished in November\n1939, And Then There\nWere None is the story\nof a group of people who\nare lured to an island by\nan unknown host and are\nkilled off one by one. You\nmay have heard of it; it is\nthe sort of book that you\nhave heard about, perhaps\ndue to its unfortunate,\nnow unprintable, original\nname, or read parodies of.\nThat is its legacy.\nWhat makes the book\nso special is the way that\nit subverts tropes and\ngenre harder than a WOC\nparliament. Most murder\nmysteries can be expected\nto have quota of one\nmurderer with a potential\nfeeble assistant and a\nsuperfluity of oh-so-inno-cent and going on virtuous\nsouls all dedicated to the\ntask of rooting out the one\nbad egg who is shown up\nat the end.\nThe Scooby-Doo\nreveal, while endlessly\nentertaining, has a long\nhistory, though it was\npreviously associated\nwith the church halls or\nmarket squares of Middle\nEngland rather than a\nhaunted fairground. And\nThen There Were None\nthrows this formula out\nof the window by making\nevery one of the characters murderers.\nThe idea, so ridiculous\nas to literally deserve\nridicule, is made to work\nby Christie by cutting\nthe whole plot off from\nthe rest of the world on\nan island which gives the\nwhole experience a claustrophobic and dream like\nquality. Fact and fiction\nblur together as everyone\nsuspects everyone else\nof being the \u2018actual\u2019\nmurderer and people go\njust a lot mad. Again.\nSound familiar or clich\u00e9d?\nThat is because it is, now.\nHow many films, books,\nplays, video games feature\nthis device of a group of\npeople trapped together\nand then people start\ndying? Maybe the words\n\u2018the black guy dies first\u2019\nwill jog your memory?\nAnd it all started here.\nChristie didn\u2019t even stop\nthere; her original plan\nwas for the reader never\nto find out who killed\nthe ten people on Soldier\nIsland. Unfortunately, this\nwas thought to be a bit too\nradical for the time, and\nprobably still is nowadays\nto be honest.\nNext week, Dramsoc\nwill be putting on a performance of And Then\nThere Were None, directed\nby Ansh Bhatnagar and\nOlivia Revans. \u201cWe hope\nto live up to the legacy\nof the book and give our\naudience both a night to\nremember and a satisfying\nconclusion to the mystery\non Soldier Island. We\nwould love you to come.\nThe play will be running\nfrom Wednesday to\nSaturday, tickets, on the\nUnion website or on the\ndoor, are only 7 pounds\nfor IC students and we\nshould be finished just in\ntime for Sports night. We,\nthe cast, hope to see you\nthere!\u201d\nISSUE 1706\nFELIX\n25\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA warm invitation to a performance of, arguably, the\nmost popular whodunit ever.\nARTS\nWhere? Royal Opera House\nWhen? Until 10 December\nHow Much? Tickets nearly\nsold out\nThe stage at the Royal Opera House morphed into the\nstreets and rich saloons of 14th century Genoa, for an\nevening of political games, action-packed scenes and\nhigh-quality music.\nSimon Baccanegra//Clive Barda\nThe sets are enormous,\nwith the same columns\nand tiled floor as a\ncommon element for\nevery scene. Simple\ndetails were added from\nscene to scene: the Doge\u2019s\npersonal belongings, a\npalace\u2019s front door, some\nscribbled Italian graffiti,\nor a lone bench in a colon-nade. During the first act,\na particularly empty stage\nproved too hard to fill for a\nlonely Hrachuhi Bassenz,\nsinging Amelia Grimaldi.\nWith the entrance of\nCarlos \u00c1lvarez, as\nSimon Boccanegra, the\nset regained energy and\ninterest.\nThere are of course\nsome brilliant moments.\nFrancesco Meli as\n\u201c...spectacular\nsword fights...\u201d\nDirected by Olivia Revans & Ansh Bhatnagar//DramSoc\n\n"

Your\nbones moan in pain as you\nsearch frantically for shel-ter.under a tree, behind a\ndustbin, in a cardboard\nbox, anything that will\nget you through the night.\nThis is just a simplified\nsnapshot of the life of\na homeless person. As\nImperial students, we are\nblessed to not be in this\nposition, but how often\ndoes it occur to us that\nthis life could very easily\nbe ours?\nAs we enjoy the pleasures of this world and sit\nin out cushioned lives, we\noften don\u2019t think twice\nabout the people who are\nsuffering on our streets:\nthe homeless man who\nwe rush past on our way\ninto the tube station, the\nwoman whom we don\u2019t\nlooktwiceataswepopinto\nthe corner shop because\nwe are \u201cso hungry\u201d or the\nchild sitting next to the\nbin in hopes that someone\nwill drop in a half-eaten\nsandwich. These are the\npeople who need our help,\nthe people who out of\nno fault of their own are\nliving a reality that they\ncan\u2019t escape. Yes, our time\nis spent worrying about\nhow many lectures we\nhave to catch up on and\nexams and lab reports, but\ncan we just give a fraction\nof this time to think about\nthem. Just a small percentage of your time to think\nabout what we can do to\nhelp those who can\u2019t help\nthemselves. Don\u2019t get me\nwrong, I get it. We don\u2019t\nalways know how to help\nand honestly as students,\nwe don\u2019t always have the\nfinances to either. But the\nvision that I am proposing\nhere is bigger than that. It\nis where we as students\nvolunteer our time to\nthe homeless and give\nthem a small part of their\nhumanity back.\nThe Imperial Muslim\nVolunteer Network\n(IMVN) has a vision to\nincrease student participation in volunteering for\nthe local community and\non campus. To help with\nthe issue of homelessness,\nwe are running fortnightly\nHomeless Drives, giving\nyou the chance to give\nfood and drink to the\nhomeless. In the run up\nto this, we are holding\nour Homeless Panel on\nTuesday 27th November\nin Huxley 340 at 6:15.\nThis event is open to all\nand aims to explore the\nissue of homelessness\nand offer solutions to the\ngrowing epidemic on our\nstreets. To find out more\ninformation on our inspiring panellists, search\nIMVN on Facebook and\nclick going on the event\npage.\nWe really do hope to\nsee you there because\nindividually we may\nnot be able to cure the\nproblem of homelessness,\nbut TOGETHER it is our\nduty to chip away at this\nepidemic for as long as we\nneed to.\nLegitimate violence?\nComment editor Charles Titmuss makes the argument that by failing to stand up to violence,\nyou only serve to legitimise it.\nViolence, or the threat\nof violence has been one\nof the governing factors of\nhuman interaction for as\nlong as humans have been\nin existence, from the\nearliest social groups right\nthrough to the foundation\nof the modern state. In the\nCOMMENT\nCharles Titmuss\nComment Editor\nmodern day, violence and\nthe threat of violence are\nthe fundamental underpinnings of state admin-istration, in ensuring that\ntaxes are paid and laws\nare obeyed. Many people,\nmostly from a libertarian\nor anarchist perspective\nquestion the legitimacy of\nthis violence, based on the\nidea that it has no moral\nlegitimacy. I would not\ndisagree with them, in that\nviolence is fundamentally\nimmoral, however, given\nthat it is so crucial to the\nunderpinning of human\nsociety, the application\nof the threat of and actual\nviolence must have some\npractical legitimacy. This\nshort opinion piece aims\nto define this practical\nlegitimacy.\nI would argue that\nthe practical legitimacy\nof violence is whatever\nthe perpetrator of that\nviolence is not brought to\naccount for. This varies\nbased on the society in\nwhich the violence is\ncommitted, for example,\nin Russia and some\nMiddle Eastern states, it is\npermissible to beat one\u2019s\nspouse and in the West it is\nhighly unlikely that drone\noperators will be brought\nto account for the violence\nthey conduct. Practically,\ntheir violence remains\nunpunished and therefore,\nby allowing the status quo\nto stand, that grants their\nactions legitimacy. This\ncan similarly be applied\nto those that take part\nin illegal civil disorder.\nAs long as they remain\nunpunished their actions\nwould be legitimate.\nThe implication of the\npractical legitimacy of\nviolence is that it demonstrates the need to have\nthe capacity to respond\nto violence acted against\noneself or the state that\none occupies in order to\ndeny the violence legit-imacy. It means that we\nmust come face to face\nwith the idea that \u201cmight\nis right,\u201d is the way that\nthe world has been run\nand will continue to be\nrun for the foreseeable\nfuture. Anyone that does\nnot believe that is living\nin a fantasy. If you ever\nwish to live in a world\nwhere that is not the case,\nthen you will have to be\nprepared to fight for it.\nEvent Poster // IMVN\n\n"

    "content": "Riz Ahmed Is Synonymous With Brown Excellence\nI\nf you\u2019re brown, woke\n(shut the fuck up it\u2019s\na meme to be woke)\nor from London,\nand especially if you\u2019re\nall three, chances are\nyou know Riz Ahmed\nto be a Desi messiah.\nRiz began his trajectory\ntowards this status after\nappearing in 2010\u2019s Four\nLions, a now cult classic\ncomedy following the hilariously misguided path\nof a group of radicalised\nMuslim men. Though on\nits surface the film was a\nslapstick, brazen, satirical\nstatement, there was certainly a layer of essential\nnuance and dissociative\nconfusion exemplified especially in Riz\u2019s character.\nIndeed, this is a contradiction that Riz\u2019s career,\nbe that acting, writing\nor rapping (the man\u2019s\na polymath, a brown\nDonald Glover of sorts)\nhas always been rooted\nin exploring. In fact, it all\nbecame comically meta\nwhen he was beaten and\ninterrogated about suspected terrorist motives\nupon returning to Luton\nairport from the Berlin\nFilm Festival in 2006\nwhere his film, The Road\nTo Guantanamo, won\nan award. That film was\nabout the real-life story of\nfour brown friends from\nBirmingham who were\nillegally imprisoned and\ntortured in Guantanamo.\nYou really can\u2019t make this\nshit up.\nTrouble at airports is\none of a lexicon of references that the perennial\nBritish Pakistani Muslim\nidentity crisis is attached\nto. Riz\u2019s art, especially his\nmusic (which he creates\nunder the name Riz MC)\nis unashamedly thorough\nand open in discussing\nthis world. It\u2019s more\nthan relatable, and that\u2019s\nprobably due to the alienation of seeing so few\nsimilar brown role models\non a platform as large as\nhis. It\u2019s for this reason,\nseeing him perform\n\u2018Shoes Off\u2019 (\u201cMy shoes\noff at the masjid, yo/ My\nshoes off at the airport\u201d)\nwhilst surrounded by\nhundreds of brown faces\nlast weekend was a real\nmoment for me. That song\nis from 2016\u2019s Cashmere\nby Swet Shop Boys, a\nhip-hop duo that Riz is\nhalf of. Influenced by the\nhilariously nonchalant\nyet impassioned Heems\n(the other half of Swet\nShop Boys and one third\nof the former Das Racist\ngoofball trio), Cashmere\nwas excitable, dreamy\nand decidedly Desi\nwithout compromising on\nrealness. Best believe my\nfavourite moment of the\nconcert was yelling out\nthe best line of the project\nin unison with Riz: \u201cZayn\nMalik\u2019s got more than\neighty virgins on him/\nThere\u2019s more than one direction to get to paradise\u201d.\nIf you really want to\nget to know the fluidity\nand imposed restlessness\nof Riz\u2019s identity and that\nof his fans, you\u2019d have to\nlisten to his solo album,\nEnglistan, released the\nsame year. The album\ndissects, narrates and\nmuses on a range of\nissues: the diverse melting\npot of Britishness, having\nto hide yourself from your\ntraditional family, depression and anxiety, the\ngovernment\u2019s economic\nshafting of the poor, psychopathic honour killings\nand good old racist\nnationalism. Riz sees all,\nfeeding off the plethora of\ncultures and perspectives\nhe\u2019s been exposed to.\nTruly, he is proof that for\nall its complexities and\nneuroticism, growing\nbrown in Britain can be a\nsociological education.\nThe music you didn\u2019t even know you needed\nI\n\u2019m mad, I\u2019m riled\nup and it\u2019s all you\nguys\u2019 fault. Why am\nI angry? I\u2019ll tell you.\nThe Friday before last I\nwas ecstatic because I was\ngoingtoFatFreddy\u2019sDrop\nat O2 Brixton. Talking to\npeople from IC on the day\nand explaining what glory\nI was soon to witness\nI realised not a single\ngoddamn person knew\nwho Fat Freddy\u2019s Drop\nare\u2026 this is unaccept-able! I\u2019m sure there are\nstudents at IC who listen\nto the group but my plan\nto write a review of their\nperformance probably\nwould\u2019ve meant nothing\nto the vast majority of\nreaders. I\u2019m not saying\nthat Fat Freddy\u2019s Drop are\nthe best band ever or that\nthey\u2019re revolutionaries.\nI\u2019m simply stating that\ntheir music is fan-fuck-ing-tastic and clearly\nmore people should be\nlistening. I\u2019m here to\nconvince you why.\nFat Freddy\u2019s Drop\nare a seven piece dub/\nreggae/soul/jazz/techno\nband from New Zealand.\nThe group started coming\ntogether in the late 90s\nbut didn\u2019t form a proper\nband until the early 00s.\nTheir debut album Based\nOn A True Story, released\nin 2005, was the highest\nselling album ever in New\nZealand. It stayed on the\ntop 40 charts for over two\nyears. Since then, they\u2019ve\nreleased three more\nstudio albums, so don\u2019t\nworry, there\u2019s plenty to go\naround.\nThe band\u2019s mix of influences and styles combine\ninto a truly unique sound\nthat you can\u2019t help but get\nswept away by. Each song\nhas contagious energy\nand gorgeous melodies\nthat anyone can enjoy.\nDallas Tamaira (aka Joe\nDukie) is the vocalist\nand has the sweetest\ncaramel-like voice that\nhas ever graced your ears,\nI just love it every time\nhe starts singing. Chris\nFaiumu ( aka DJ Fitchie)\nis both the bands percussionist and producer; he\u2019s\nexceptionally talented.\nThe mixing of the tracks\nis always spot-on and\nhe makes the percussion\nnot just something in the\nbackground but one of the\nbest parts of each song\ndue to his perfect pitching\nand texture choices.\nThe rest of the band\nmake up the instrumental profile: saxophone,\ntrumpet, trombone, tuba,\nkeyboard and guitar.\nTheir first two albums\nare polished versions of\nlive performances they\ngave for FOUR YEARS\nbefore they gathered in\nthe studio! The band is a\nwell oiled machine that\nhave been perfecting their\ncraft and group chemistry\nover the decades.\nI could go on for\nanother half page but it\u2019s\nprobably better if you just\nlisten yourself so here\nare my recommendations\nto get started. If you\u2019re\nlooking for an album,\nlisten to Based On A\nTrue Story. Want up-beat\nenergetic songs? Listen to\n\u2018Roady\u2019, \u2018Pull the Catch\u2019,\nand \u2018Silver and Gold\u2019.\nFeeling blue? Listen to\n\u2018Dark Days\u2019, \u2018Del Fuego\u2019,\nand \u201910 Feet Tall\u2019. Only\nwant smash hits? Listen\nto \u2018Ernie\u2019, \u2018Blackbird\u2019,\nand \u2018Wandering Eye\u2019.\nIf even one person\nstarts listening because\nof me I\u2019ll have done my\njob properly. Then maybe\nI can stop sulking and\nsimmer down.\nMUSIC\nAsad Raja\nMusic Editor\nMUSIC\nGuthrie Ruby\nMusic Writer\nCheck out Riz\u2019s new single,\u2018Mogambo\u2019and watch out for his upcoming BBC show,\n\u2018Englistan\u2019// DIY Magazine\nISSUE 1706\nFELIX\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n14\nFat Freddy\u2019s Drop looking like a goofy Oceans 11 cast // Wikipedia\n\n"

Win win. The\nrace consists of 2-mile\nrun, 10-mile bike and then\nanother 1-mile run. The\nmen\u2019s race was an hour\nearlier than the women\u2019s,\nso the 10-strong male contingent had an inhumane\n5:30am alarm. With the\nweather looking dreadful\nfor the whole morning,\nmoral was understandably\nlow as we met cold, wet\nand tired at 6:10am. After\nan uneventful journey we\nmade it to the race track at\nHillingdon. Undeterred by\nthe extremely expensive\nbikes we saw on arrival,\nwe racked our own and\nregistered.\nThe race and predicted\ndownpour started bang on\ntime at 8am and the men\nset off to run two laps of\nthe track. The field was\nstrong and Hillingdon Triathletes \u2013 on their home\nturf \u2013 wanted to prove\nthemselves against the\nImperial team. Setting off\nat a storming pace was no\ndeterrent for Matt Ryan as\nhe showed us the quality\nin army fitness training.\nOnto the bike and Matt\u2019s\nlead became short lived as\ncompetition arrived in the\nform of \u2018rocket\u2019 Romain.\nRomain has the aerodynamic footprint of a paper\nplane, and combined with\nthe wattage cottage that\nhis legs are, he won 2nd\nplace. Luke Whiting, an\nexceptional all-rounder\nwas also up in the top 5.\nThe seemingly endless\nheadwind on the back\nstraight was loudly\nchastised by everyone,\nafter all, everyone knows\nshouting at the wind\nmakes you go faster. The\nmost difficult part of the\nrace was not in battling\nthe headwind as it turned\nout but in counting to\n10. Honourable mentions\ngo to Daniel Boulby and\nWim Van Der Schoot\nwho both decided that\n10 laps were not enough\nand did 11 instead. The\nrace for the win came\ndown to a sprint finish,\nwith Romain coming a\ncommendable 2nd place\nby only a second. 6 of\nthe top 15 were Imperial\nathletes, with 5th place\ngoing to Luke Whiting,\n6th to Matt Ryan, 8th to\nAngus Phillips, 9th to\nMark Pollock and 15th\nto Cedric Ormond. It was\nalso great to see so many\ngiving duathlons a go for\nthe first time, well done to\nAlex Luisi, Daniel Boulby\nand Shravan Nageswaren.\n\u201c3 out of the\ntop 4 female\nduathletes\nwere Imperial\u201d\n\u201cWe chose to\ndo even more\nexercise and\ncycle back\nhome\u201d\nThe girls arrived\nsignificantly better\nrested and dryer than the\nboys for their 9am start.\nImperial had a strong\nrepresentation in the\nwomen\u2019s race with about\n20% of the field. Spoiler\nalert: 3 out of the top 4\nwere Imperial. Almost\nsounds like an academic\nleague table. With Freya\nEspir leading the run and\nbeing first into transition,\nhopes were high that\nshe would take the win.\nClosely following in her\nwake were Minty Martin\nand Marion Artigaut. The\nrecovering Imperial men\u2019s\nteam were playing their\nrole and providing enthusiastic support and live\nintelligence to the women\nas they went into the\nbike. About 10 laps later\nFreya was off the bike, I\nsay about 10 because she\nactually did 11, yet still\ncame 3rd. Kudos. Minty\n(who did do 10 laps)\ncame in for 2nd place and\nMarion in 4th. Lois Baker,\nEmma Claxton, Esme\nHotson Moore and Mari\nFunabashi all had strong\nraces.\nThe organisers found\nit very funny how STEM\nstudents could not count\nto 10, but we set our reputation straight by assuring\nthem that UCL would\nonly do worse.\nFlapjacks, cakes,\ngossip and race stories\nwere then shared between\nthe victorious Imperial\nteam. Whilst we were\nrecovering a few of the\nfaster duathletes got to\nstand on the podium and\nclaim their rewards from\nthe Hillingdon champagne\ncupboard.\nFollowing the women\u2019s\nrace was \u2018the main event\u2019,\n\u2018what we woke up for\u2019\nor \u2018the cutest thing since\nCharlie bit my finger\u2019 \u2013\nthe under 8\u2019s duathlon.\nThis draft-legal, stabilis-ers-illegal duathlon was\nwell worth staying for.\nThe Spiderman trisuits\nand dinosaur helmets\nwere too much for some,\nwho decided there and\nthen to adopt.\nAs the weather had\ndecidedly improved, we\nchose to do even more\nexercise and cycle back\nhome. Back in Hammersmith, we enjoyed a\ncompulsory microwave\nmeal (courtesy of The\nWilliam Morris). A couple\nof soggy sausages and wa-tered-down maple syrup\nwas just what the group of\ndamp duathletes needed.\nAfter dabbling in daytime\ndrinking, we then realised\nthat we were at Imperial\nand we had more work\nthan time, so we made our\nways back home to relish\nin a hot shower.\nDespite the inclement\nweather, another successful outing for 16 of\nImperial\u2019s triathletes and\ngood preparation for next\nweekend for the biggest\nand best duathlon of the\nyear: BUCS Duathlon.\nBUCS marks the end\nof the duathlon season\nfor the year, but do not\ndespair as come the new\nyear we\u2019ll be competing\nin aquathons (swimming\nand running) building\nup to triathlons around\nSpring.\nSixteen strong group of Imperial Dualthletes // IC Triathlon\n\u2018Rocket\u2019Romain strutin\u2019on the podium // IC Triathlon\n\n"

Young Barbican is a\nfree membership scheme\nthat gives large discounts\non tickets to most events\nand you\u2019re never charged\na booking fee. Sometimes\nthey even have free events.\nSo there you go \u2013 for very\nlittle money you can enjoy\nwonderful artists in one of\nthe London\u2019s most famous\nvenues \u2013 the Barbican\nCentre. I saw Tim Hecker\nthere for only \u00a35 in September. Another pearl of\nbrutalist architecture \u2013\nSouthbank Centre \u2013 also\nwarmly welcomes young\npeople to their buildings.\nThey offer probably\nthe widest range of free\nevents and they always\nhave a limited number\nof student tickets with\n25% discount. Moreover,\nyou can sign up for their\n\u201cunder 30 scheme\u201d. Every\ntwo weeks you will be\nsent an email with the\npromo code to get free or\n\u00a310 tickets for selected\nevents.\nGoing further east\ninto more hipster parts\nof London, RichMix in\nShoreditch offers a Mixer\nmembership for a fiver.\nYou can get free tickets\nto some of their shows,\nif you\u2019re quick enough.\nAlthough, don\u2019t expect\nany big names here.\nOn the other hand, Get\nIn members can get \u00a35\ntickets for some of the\nshows at Roundhouse.\n(I\u2019m focusing on music\nhere, but these memberships give you discounts\non other things too, such\nas cinema, exhibitions and\ntheatre).\nDownload apps\nYou may want to\ndownload a few apps to\nsave some pennies. If\nyou\u2019re a classical music\ngeek, then get StudentPulse and you will get\naccess to classical music\nconcerts across London\nfor no more than a tenner.\nIf you\u2019re planning on\nseeing big names and\ndecide to spend those\n\u00a360 on Arctic Monkeys,\nconsider buying it through\nDice if possible \u2013 you\nwill at least save a couple\nquid on the booking fees.\nDice\u2019s fees are much\nlower than other ticketing\nagencies and every now\nand then they put on sales,\nwhich means you can save\neven more money. And\nif the event is sold out\nand your last resort is a\nsecond-hand ticket \u2013 get it\nthrough Twickets \u2013 don\u2019t\nget ripped off by ViaGoGo\nscammers.

They often have\nfree tickets to shows to\ngive away in competitions\nor promo codes for dis-counts. So keep an eye out\nfor offers from TimeOut,\nLondon Calling, Mr Hyde\netc. If you sign up to their\nnewsletters you will stay\nupdated about what\u2019s\nhappening in London and\nknow about free oppor-tunities.

They record\nconcerts of all kinds\n(ranging from classical\nthrough jazz to rock),\nradio, and TV shows.\nThey need to fill up their\nstudios with an audience\nsomehow and they do that\nthrough random draws.\nYou just need to apply. I\nwas lucky enough to be\nin the audience for one of\nthe episodes of Later\u2026\nwith Jools Holland (after\nabout 2 years of applying\nthough, so be persistent!).\nWork or volunteer\nLast, but not least, if\nyou don\u2019t have money\nbut do have time, a good\noption is to volunteer at\nfestivals. It\u2019s not ideal, as\nsometimes you\u2019re not able\nto see your favourite acts,\nbut you can at least watch\nsome gigs as a reward for\nyour work, and you get\nthe chance to be close to\nthe action and spend time\nin areas not accessible to\nregular customers. You\ncan also try to get a job\nat one of the venues and\nget paid whilst also being\nable to catch a glimpse\nof what\u2019s happening on\nstage.

During the\nsummer plenty of open-air\nevents happen all over the\ncity and some have free\nentry, like the Walthamstow Garden Party and the\nKorean Festival in Trafalgar Square, so keep your\neyes open for those.

Little\ndid I know, however, the\nsize of the difference was\nfar greater than I could\nhave imagined. Having\nbarely enough money to\nsurvive as an Imperial\nstudent I couldn\u2019t even\nthink of buying expensive\ntickets to gigs. It felt kind\nof bittersweet \u2013 I was\nfinally so close to all these\niconic venues and my\nfavourite artists, yet they\nremained so out of reach.\nNevertheless, I was keen\nto explore the new sonic\nlandscape I found myself\nin. My growing interest in\nworld music led me to realise that gigs of this kind\nwere usually pretty cheap\n(if not free!) and the vibe\nis always great. You could\nget unbelievably high\nquality for low prices,\nso of course I started\nexploring options there.\nLike with everything else\nin life, the first step is all it\ntakes to get the ball rolling\nand soon I learnt about\nnumerous venues offering\nfree gigs across various\ngenres and ways to get\ndiscounts.\nNow, after 4 years\nof studies at Imperial\nCollege filled with hard\nwork and intense research,\nI can say with confidence\nthat I possess a wealth of\nknowledge about cheap\ngigs in London, which I\nam generously deciding to\nshare with you, dear poor\nstudent, in this article.\nHere are my tips on\nhow to get the most out\nof London scene without\nspending a fortune.\nJoin Alternative\nMusic Society\nStart here. It\u2019s the best\nsociety at Imperial. (I\u2019m\nnot at all biased, I definitely didn\u2019t spend half of my\ntime at Imperial being on\nthe committee\u2026). AMS\nsells subsidised tickets to\ngigs, but most importantly\nyou\u2019ll meet cool people\nwho share your passion\nfor music and can help\nyou stay updated about\neverything music. Also,\nwatch out for the events\norganised by other soci-eties. Jazz&Rock holds\nregular events where you\ncan listen to Imperial\u2019s\nvery own student bands at\nthe Union for free or for\na couple of quid. We also\nhave orchestras, choirs,\nacapella groups etc. who\nperform regularly, so if\nyou want to experience the\nartistic side of Imperial\nand support your friends,\ngo and explore what Beit\nvenues have on offer.\nVisit small venues\nEnjoying live music\nfrom the comfort of a\ncampus sounds like a nice\noption. It\u2019s easy to limit\nyourself to the Imperial\nbubble, but by all means\ntry not to! Once you feel\ncomfortable with your\nnew home and have made\nnew friends, get out of\nSouth Ken and explore.\nThere are plenty of pubs\nin London that host live\nrock/blues/jazz bands\nand don\u2019t always charge\nfor entry (and if they do\nit\u2019s a very small fee), for\nexample: The Old Blue\nLast, The Shacklewell\nArms, The Blues Kitchen,\nAin\u2019t Nothin But\u2026 the\nlist goes on.

Fuck off.\nI say drag her in front of\nthe House and make her\ntestify for four hours. Now\nthat would give me something to talk about. In the\nmeantime, the Trumps are\nhypocrites and this should\nbe a shocker to nobody.\nIf this, in fact, was a\nshocker to you, I would\nrecommend a consult\nwith a proctologist - they\nmay be able to locate your\nhead.\nOkay, that\u2019s one done\nand dusted.

I mean,\nshe\u2019s occupied the post\nbefore. Chuck Schumer is\nobjectively worse. And, to\nbe fair to her, one of the\nreasons she\u2019s so poorly\nliked is because she\u2019s\nnot winning in districts\nthat went for Trump;\nshe\u2019s the boogeyman, the\narchetypical Limousine\nLiberal, come on high\nfrom the ivory tower to to\ntell everyone to knock the\nracism off.

It turns out - even\nback in the early Obama\nyears - she never really\nhad that much to do with\nDem performance in the\nHouse. Standard polling\nfare - incumbent president\napproval rating, economic\nperformance, and the\nlike - had more to do with\nelectoral wins than Pelosi\nas a figure.\nFor a brief moment, she\nwas challenged by Martha\nFudge.

Sorry,\nboomers - if you fucked\nup the economy that\nbadly, you don\u2019t get to\nbe condescending about\neconomics.\nHere\u2019s a good one.\nTrump\u2019s been ducking an\ninterview with Mueller\nfor a year or so now,\nbecause obviously Trump\nwill perjure himself the\nmoment he opens his\nmouth. This is what\nTrump\u2019s lawyers know,\nwhat onlookers know,\nand what Mueller knows.\nTrump\u2019s legal team has\nbeen going back-and-forth with the investigato-rial team; they eventually\nsettled on written questions (because then Trump\ncan do what his lawyers\nsay). Well, apparently,\nthe answers to Mueller\u2019s\nquestions were submitted\nlast Tuesday, according\nto Trump. No news what\nthe answers - or even the\nquestions - were. Guess\nwe\u2019ll just have to wait.\nSo, the probe creaks\nfurther on.

The\nmaster of Birkbeck, David\nLatchman, believes the\ngovernment would be able\nto subsidise the cuts at \u201cno\n\u2013 or minimal \u2013 additional\ncost\u201d.\nAs Felix has previously\nreported, any move to\nlower tuition fees would\npredominantly benefit\nwealthy students. Students\nfrom poorer backgrounds\nare less likely to pay off\nthe full amount of their\nstudent loans than their\nwell-off peers. Lowering\ntuition fees would not\n\u2013 for most low-earning\ngraduates \u2013 make any difference to the total amount\nrepaid before the debt is\nwritten off. For graduates\nwith salaries above the\ncurrent \u00a325,000 repayment threshold, however,\nthe amount they pay back\nwill reduce in line with\ntuition fees (interest rate\nchanges notwithstanding).\nAn analysis by The Times\nsuggests that low-earning\ngraduates would save an\naverage of \u00a31 each year.\nCont. pg 3\nNEWS\nIn conversation\nwith Professor\nStephen Curry\nPAGE 4\nCOMMENT\nHomelessness:\nA Harsh Reality\nPAGE 7\nMUSIC\nBangers, bops\nand chunes\nPAGE 15\nSPORT\nICXC regains\nBannister Cup\nPAGE 40\nTackling student debts has become a key pledge for politicians trying to secure the youth vote // Quinn Dombrowski\n\n"

As the\nhour grew near, the teams\ngathered by the Windmill\nTea Rooms to prepare for\nthe start of the race.\nAs usual, the race\nbegan with a stampede as\n216 runners stormed off\nat 15:15 in the afternoon\nand made their way to the\nwoods.\nThe course is well-known for its technical\nterrain and has been\nknown to turn many\nankles over the years.\nThis year the days\npreceding the race had\nbeen suitably wet, making\nthe course even more\ntechnical than it otherwise\nwould have been.\nThe wide start-line soon\nnarrowed to an early bot-tleneck, where ICXCAC\nstar Niki managed to trip\nnewbie PhDaniel who\nfell with a thud before\nsomehow making it back\nto his feet without being\ntrampled.\nThe route then took the\nrunners along the path\nfor a long straight before\nturning into mud. Several\nundulations and puddles\nlater, the course led downwards before a long climb\nback towards the start to\ncomplete the lap.\nVery quickly the\nrunners started to reach\nthe finish line as after\n18:16, Imperial\u2019s Katie\nOlding came in first in the\nwomen\u2019s race, followed\nvery closely by a St Mary\u2019s\nathlete who spoiled an\nImperial clean-sweep\nas Alex Mundell and\nGeorgia Curry came third\nand fourth place in 18:25\nand 18:39 respectively.\nChloe Baker rounded off\nthe team for Imperial,\nwith a stunning 9th on her\nICXCAC debut.\nOn the day, Imperial\u2019s\nA team came in first with\n587 points, St Mary\u2019s\nA team came in a close\nsecond with 581 points,\nKing\u2019s A team in third\nwith 537 points and UCL\u2019s\nA team in fourth with 525\npoints.\nThis allowed Imperial\u2019s\nWomen\u2019s A to build on\ntheir commanding lead in\nthe league, with the team\nnow on 1741 points \u2013 increasing their lead by 62\npoints to 91 ahead of UCL\nA\u2019s 1650 with two races to\ngo next term.\nIn the men\u2019s race, St\nMary\u2019s athletes dominated\nthefield,taking9ofthetop\n12 places, but fortunately,\nImperial runners Niki\n\u201cTripper\u201d Faulkner and\ndebutant Dan \u201cTripped\u201d\nMulryan broke the St\nMary\u2019s perfect finish as\nthey placed fifth and third\nrespectively in 31:21 and\n31:15.\nIt takes more than one\nfall to keep Dan from the\nmedals!\nOn the day, SMU\nplaced 1st and 2nd with\ntheir A and B teams, with\nImperial Men\u2019s A coming\nin third \u2013 their best finish\nin the league this season \u2013\ngaining 36 points on UCL.\nOverall, Imperial\nMen\u2019s A remain in 4th,\nsome 75 points adrift of St\nMary\u2019s in 3rd and a commanding 131 point ahead\nof Reading in 5th.\nWimbledon Common\nhas always been host to\nthe annual University\nof London XC Championships and Bannister\nCup \u2013 two championships\nwith a separate scoring\nsystem from the overall\nleague.

There\u2019s a\nhuge spectrum of British\nmusicians who now dominate the charts and are\nfirmly supported by the\nBBC, allowing them to\nmaintain their presence in\nthe media. Interestingly,\nwhat people perhaps don\u2019t\nknow, is that many of the\nmusicians we see may\nhave risen to the heights\nthey\u2019re at today thanks\nto the help of the BBC\nlaunching them onto the\nscene via their dedicated\nBBC Music Introducing\ninitiative. With the aim\nof bringing together all\nthe supporters of Britain\u2019s\nunsigned musicians, artists can upload their music\nto the service in the hope\nthat Introducing provides\nthem with the exposure\nthey desire to kickstart\ntheir career.\nIn the spirit of elevating the freshest faces in\nthe game, BBC Music\nIntroducing took over\nTobacco Dock in East\nLondon to hold a three-day extravaganza of live\nmusic, industry sessions,\nand interactive workshops\naimed at anyone looking\nfor a career in the music\nindustry: aspiring artists,\npotential producers, and\ndreaming DJs alike. We,\non behalf of Felix, were\nlucky enough to attend\none of the days, exploring\nthe festival, and sampling\nthe plethora of masterclasses that the event had\nto offer.\nImagine Willy Wonka\u2019s\nChocolate Factory, but\ninstead of endless sweets\nand chocolate, we saw\ncountless guitars and\nkeyboards. Instead of\nrooms full of food-based\nexploration, we experimented with the newest\ntechnology that music had\nto offer. Instead of oom-pa-loompas, we had some\nof the most well-informed\nnames of the music\nindustry, from employees\nat industry giants to the\nartists themselves.\nMy first taste of one\nof the masterclasses was\nthe \u2018Making it in Pop\nMusic\u2019 panel talk, a talk\nwhich aimed to nurture\nthe creative direction of\nbudding pop artists. While\ninitially I was drawn in by\nan impressive panel which\nincluded Danny Jones\nfrom McFly, it quickly\ndawned on me that the\nadvice being given would\nserve helpful for when\nI finally realise I should\ngive up my maths degree\nand pursue my love of\nmusic.\nMeanwhile, Jiangxuan\u2019s reward for waiting in\none of the longest queues\nfor any event was a\ncramped spot on the floor\nfor the \u2018Art of Songwriting\u2019 workshop, where the\nlikes of Jake Gosling (Ed\nSheeran, Shawn Mendes,\nOne Direction), Kieran\nShudall (Circa Waves)\nand James Gillespie (Rag\n& Bone Man) talked him\nthrough the workflow\ninvolved in coming up\nwith musical and lyrical\ncontent. A unifying theme\nwas persistence \u2013 the\nmajority of the speakers\nmentioned that it takes\nyears of practice and\nendeavour before getting\nnoticed. Tips to aspiring\nsongwriters: always\nhave a guitar plugged in\nand ready somewhere;\nkeep recording yourself\nand don\u2019t lose track of\nyour ideas; a good demo\nalways leaves room for\nimagination.\nAli Tant from Polydor\nRecords, who works with\na remarkable range of\nartists from Eminem to\nThe 1975, insightfully\ncommented, \u201cthe best\npopstars are the ones who\naren\u2019t ashamed of things\nthat fail\u201d, which seemed\nto resonate with the room.\nThe room was jampacked\nfull of eager faces and\nwide ears which appeared\nto absorb all the advice\ngiven by the knowledgeable speakers. This interest\nonly seemed to heighten\nthroughout the day as I\nattended more talks such\nas \u2018Music & Tech: VR,\nAI, Bots & Blockchain\nExplained\u2019 which talked\nof a future of robot-led\nmusic and virtual reality\nconcerts. In a later talk,\nwe heard Afro-Swing\ngiant Hardy Caprio talk of\nhow he balanced his university work with making\n#1 records; inspirational\nto say the least.\nStephen Taverner,\ncurrent manager of\nMercury Prize winning\ngroups Wolf Alice and\nalt-J (\u2206\u2206\u2206\u2206\u2206\u2206), brought\nabout some insights on\nhow these two bands dealt\nwith success, reminiscing\nabout the early days of a\ncash-strapped alt-J with\nlow-quality instruments\nwhich their songwriting\nwas distinctive enough\nto transcend, and Wolf\nAlice\u2019s evolution in stage\npresence and musical\nconfidence \u2013 Wolf Alice\nrecently embarked on\ntheir first ever Asian tour,\nand Stephen was especially pleased at the large\nlocal fanbases the band\nhas garnered.\nA climatic end to the\nday brought the BBC\nRadio 1Xtra Takeover\nwhich treated us to a\nhandful of live acts. While\nmy West-Midlands heart\nwas slightly crushed on\nhearing the news that\nLady Leshurr was too ill\nto perform; we were not\nleft disappointed with energetic performances from\nthe likes of: Geko, Shakka,\nLotto Boyz, Donae\u2019o, and\nChronixx, among others.\nThe highlight for me was\na performance from Nao.\nI\u2019d best describe her work\nas a tasteful blend of Mura\nMasa, Frank Ocean, and\nSZA, so I was excited to\nhear her perform songs\nfrom her new album\nSaturn.\nIt was clear to me\nthat the event forms the\nmusical foundation for\nnot only the expertise,\nbut also the inspiration,\nof the next generation\u2019s\nmusical talents. The best\nof which I\u2019m sure were\npresent over the three\ndays. Many people exchanged their details and\nInstagram handles with\nme (e.g. @alexmitcham\nahem) throughout the day\nso I hope to keep an eye\non this flourishing talent\nin years to come.\nAnd guess what?

Divided\ninto three main parts\nentitled \u201cLife at night\u201d,\n\u201cLife in caves\u201d, and \u201cLife\nin the deep\u201d, we are met\nwith countless nocturnal\nanimals, cave-dwellers,\nand deep-sea creatures.\nOf the array of animals\ncovered in the exhibition,\nranging from small fuzzy\naye-ayes to live Mexican\nblind cave fish, some\nseem almost alien. The\nfact that only 5% of the\nworld\u2019s seas have been\nencountered by humans\nmakes us wonder what\nelse could be lying below\nin the depths of the ocean\n\u2013 you\u2019ll leave this exhibition believing anything is\npossible after seeing what\nalready exists, such as the\npreserved black seadevil\nand dumbo octopus on\ndisplay.\nIn classic Natural\nHistory Museum style, the\nexhibition is extremely\nfamily-friendly, and there\nis a clear emphasis on the\ninteractive aspect, as we\nencounter soundscapes,\nscents, light installations,\nand free-to-touch furry\ntaxidermy animals,\nmaking it compelling and\naccessible for children and\nadults alike. Somehow an\nideal balance has been\nstruck between visual\nstimulation and interactivity suitable for children,\nyet enough written information to allow adults to\nengage as well.\nThere\u2019s a wonderful\nblend of modern interactive displays with some of\nthe museum\u2019s specimens\nfrom their plentiful col-lections. All your senses\nare engaged, and the\ndim, almost non-existent\nlighting heightens all\nyour other senses and\nremoves you from the\nbustling world outside\nof the exhibition. The\nfirst room hits you with a\ncacophony of night-time\nforest sounds, whilst the\nfinal room immerses you\nin a mesmerising simulation of a bioluminescent\ndeep-sea environment,\nwith hundreds of oscillating lights on the ceiling.\nAnd all that\u2019s in between\nis equally as engaging.\nThere\u2019s a chance to see\nyourself through the\neyes of a cave boa via\nan infrared live camera\nof the room, or smelling\nstations where various\nhandheld devices emit\nodours for you to guess,\nincluding eucalyptus,\nlemon, mango, wood sap,\nas well as the less enticing\nguano (bat excrement)\nand worms.\nAdults may find their\nticket prices a little\nsteep at \u00a312.50, but with\nchildren 16 and under\ngoing in completely free,\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s a decent deal\nfor a family.

Although, I thought\nit was best to embrace\nmy lack of knowledge on\nthe subject matter, and\nto learn from what I was\nabout to witness. And\nlearn, I did.\nThe reading, which was\ndirected and performed by\nD/deaf (some prefer it to\nbe capitalised) and disabled women, focused on\nthe D/deaf and disabled\nwomen who fought for\nsuffrage 100 years ago\nand the challenges these\nwomen face now, was\nimmersive and touching.\nt was clear from the first\nmoment how passionate\nthe cast was to be a part\nof such a remarkable play.\nDespite the very specific\nsubject matter, the reading\nwas inclusive throughout.\nBeing informed first hand\nthe amount of difficulties\nthese women face in their\nday to day lives, such as\ndifficulties in voting and\ngetting jobs as serious actresses gave the reading an\nextra emotional punch, as\nnow the play was not just\nabout women who lived\n100 years ago, but women\nwho live now amongst us.\nPerhapsthemostshocking part of the reading was\nhow relevant it felt to the\ncurrent world. Particularly, it was eye-opening to\nfind out about the challenges disabled people\nstill face in voting. In fact,\naccording to And Others,\n17% of disabled people\nwere turned away at polling stations in 2014, a\nnumber which astonished\nme. This was due to une-quipped polling stations,\nand a lack of easy-read\nvoting ballots, amongst\nother reasons.\nOther current issues\nthat the women touched\nupon included the gender\npay-gap, LGBT rights,\nfeminism, men\u2019s roles in\nfeminism and the #MeToo\nmovement, with a not-so-subtle reference to the\nwidely publicised sexual assault accusations\ntowards the then-United\nStates Supreme Court\nnominee Brett Kavanaugh\nby Dr Christine Ford.\nArguably the most significant running theme\nthroughout the reading\nwas the importance of\nlearning from our past\nto avoid repeating some\nmistakes in the future. In\ntimes like these, it is of\nutmost importance to appreciate how far we\u2019ve\ncome in the last 100 years\nto establishing fair, equal\ncommunities, although it\nis at least as vital to know\nhow far there is to go.\nAs pointed out by an\naudience member during the Q&A following\nthe performance, history\nis a narrative that we are\nwriting right now.

    "content": "A Small Place and a Big\nMessage\nSuper Duper Close Up\nO\nnce you enter\nthe Gate\nTheatre, you\nare brought into\na room lined with rows of\nchairs and scattered with\nseemingly out-of-place\nobjects. Looking around,\nyou see that there is no\nstage and you realise that\nthe \u2018show\u2019 you believed\nyou were coming to see\nis far closer to a private\nmeeting. With no an-nouncement, lights dim,\nmusic blares and the\nperformance begins.\nA Small Place is an\ninvolved two-person narrative of the 1988 essay\nof Jamaica Kincaid. The\npiece focuses on corrup-tion, slavery and general\nhuman filth and through-out, the audience is made\nto feel responsible for it\nall. This confrontational\nperformance is given by\nour narrators, Cherrelle\nSkeete and Nicola Alexis,\nwho take turns to tell of\nthe shame of tourism and\nthe gross English occupancy ofAntigua. Skeete\u2019s\ncharacter appears to be\nthe calmer of the two and\nalthough she acknowledges the horror of what is\nhappening in Antigua, she\nis also in a state of denial\nand cautious positivity\nwhen the piece begins. It\nis Alexis, with her calculated and hard reason, who\neventually works the pair\ninto a rage and shows the\naudience the true hatred\nboiling in the hearts of\nthese two women.\nThe intensity and\nintimacy of this work is\nincredible and stifling.\nThe clever use of light\nand the discomforting\nuse of static and noise\nsurrounds the audience.\nBetter still are the narrators themselves who truly\ncarry the performance. In\nboth Skeete and Alexis,\nthere is an urgency and\nraw emotion in face and\nvoice. The pair directly\nentreat the audience and\nunder their gaze, we are\nleft feeling quite naked,\nparticularly when Skeete\nis brought to the verge\nof tears speaking of the\nwrongs of slavery. It\ntruly is an emotional and\npowerful experience.\nAs stated though, it is\nthe actors that drive this\npiece and there were what\nI felt to be unnecessary\nand distracting additions\nto the work. The room\nis littered with mundane\nitems; a projector is used\nto focus the audience on a\nparticular image or to encourage us to imagine our\nown, books are used to\nrepresent knowledge and\nstress the importance of\nthe old Antiguan library.\nBut these small props are\nwhere it should have been\nleft. There was a screen\nin one corner of the room\nplaced on a bookshelf. At\nseemingly random points,\nthe screen would turn on\nand show some image\nor film without audio.\nMost confusing was the\ninclusion of a scene from\nthe classic Disney film,\nBeauty and the Beast. This\nclip was later distorted\nand played at an increased\nspeed and in negative;\nperhaps it was actually a\nvery brilliant reference,\nbut it was definitely lost on\nme. The actors also quite\nliterally weaved through\nthe audience, handing\nmembers a string of red\nwool as they went. This\nappeared to be a means\nof representing the slave\ntrade and the red blood\nlinking us all. However,\nI found that I was more\nconscious of not tripping\nup one of the narrators\nthan actually listening to\nwhat they had to say.\nPutting this aside, A\nSmall Place had some\ngenuinely inspiring\nmoments and its dark\nhumour was an important,\nif not painful, reminder of\nour beastly history. The\nwonderful description of\nAntigua\u2019s beauty and the\nterrible account of tragedy\nwill certainly stay with me\nfor a long time.\nO\nne moment\nscreaming pas-sionately, the\nnext sitting in\nthe audience eating pop-corn, Jessica Latowicki\u2019s\ncreative performance will\nfeel like all of your anxieties embodied in front of\nyou. Throw in a camera,\nsome French skincare\nand a backdrop of a dark\nforest and you have Super\nDuper Close Up.\nCovered in glittery\nprops and drowned in the\ntunes of bubblegum pop a\nla Robyn, it is a one-wom-an play written and\nperformed by Latowicki.\nDespite the glitzy set up,\nher 80 minute monologue\nis everything but sparkly\nand upbeat. She manages\nto perform the anxiety of a\nmillennial career woman\nall in the span of one story,\nwhich she sidetracks from\nand returns to throughout\nthe play. You could say it\nis a ramble, or a rant of\nsorts, but a fun one indeed.\nLatowicki\u2019s nihilistic\ncomments will have the\naudience laughing from\nminute to minute, things\nlike \u201cI read the news at\nnight just so that I can\njustify my nightmares and\ninsomnia\u201d. Through this\npessimistic ramble, we get\na glimpse into a very real\nperson, and much of it is\nvery relatable for a young\nadult in today\u2019s capitalistic reality. Latowicki is\ndressed in a shiny, green\ndress and is standing in\nthe middle of the stage\nvery determinedly. She\nhas this angry Piper\nChapman (Orange Is The\nNew Black) energy about\nher. The whole setting\nis eerie (think Stanley\nKubrick\u2019s two girls in The\nShining).\nApart from a maybe\nunnecessarily dragged out\ndance scene towards the\nend, the whole play fits\ntogether seamlessly with\nall its agendas and media.\nThe experimental integration of technology is bril-liant. Latowicki criticises\nour use of technology\ntoday, our \u2018scrolling and\nscrolling\u2019 through social\nmedias, at the same time\nas the play builds on the\nuse of it. Large parts of\nthe play are livestreamed\non a screen as they are\nsimultaneously taking\nplace right in front of you.\nSometimes you are unsure\nwhich one you should be\nlooking at (I mean this\nin the best way possible),\nif you might miss something by just looking at\nthe screen. The camera\nbecomes a narrative in\nitself, choosing to zoom\nin very close, showing\nonly selected parts of a\nparticular scene. A lot\nof the play is centered\naround this topic, about\nspending your life looking\nat screens, jiggling too\nmany open tabs, ordering\ntoo many things online\nand posting too many\nthings on your instagram\nfor everyone to see.\nLatowicki is easy to\nlisten to, but can still make\nyou feel uncomfortable\nwith scenes of her panting\nand screaming, or even\ndancing in a very sexual\nmanner, with the camera\nvery close up to her. She is\nrelatable but intimidating,\nsatirical and scary.

If you could\ngivesomebackground\nto it: where did it come\nfrom, the steps that\nhave been taken to\nget it to the point\nthat it\u2019s at now and to\ndescribe the point that\nit\u2019s at now?\nStephen: Well the\npoint that it\u2019s at now is\nthat it\u2019s just been pub-lished. Where did it come\nfrom? It apparently came\nfrom the creation of the\nposition that I occupy.\nI wrote the strategy as\nAssisant Provost for EDI\nand that\u2019s a new position\nat the College. I started in\nOctober last year, so I\u2019ve\nbeen in it just over a year.\nIt had also been sparked\nby the institutional culture\nreview which happened\na few years ago and was\nactually triggered by an\nincident that happened\nbetween the Men\u2019s and\nWomen\u2019s rugby teams.\nNow, in the end, although\nwhat triggered it was an\nincident between student\nsocietites, actually the\nreport focused largely\non the culture within\ndepartments and the\nworking environment\nfor staff here. One of the\nthings they noticed is the\nperception of many staff\nis that Imperial is a highly\ncompetitive working\nenvironment- that\u2019s kind\nof what you\u2019d expect\nfrom an institute that\u2019s\nresearch intensive, that is\nworld class, that operates\nin a globally competitive\nmarket. But there was\na sense that... what was\nmissing was an emphasis\non collaboration, on\nempathy, on actually understanding the pressures\nthat people work under\nand the sorts of behaviours that can lead to and\nengender.\nI am really interested in\nthe culture of science and\nhow universities work and\nthe value that they offer to\nsociety. They\u2019re supposed\nto be agents of social\nmobility and, in a ways,\nthey\u2019re not really doing\nthat nearly as well as they\ncould and should be. I\u2019ve\nspent a lot of time in the\nfirst few months talking to\nlots of different people at\nall parts of the university\nto get a sense of what\nare we doing well across\nthis agenda and what are\nwe not doing enough\nand that was the basis of\nstarting then to write the\nstrategy. The strategy was\ndeveloped with lots of\nconsultation with lots of\ndifferent people and one\nother thing to appreciate\nis, coincident with the\ncreation of this position,\nthe way that the College\noversees work on EDI\nwas changed and there are\nnow two primary committees that oversee that.\nThere\u2019s an EDI strategy\ngroup, which is chaired by\nthe Provost. I sit on that\nbut it also has the Faculty\nDeans and there\u2019s about\na dozen people on it, all\nquite senior. That was\ndeliberately kept a relatively small group so that\nit had focused discussion\nand executive authority.\nIn parallel with that, we\nset up an EDI Forum and\nthat is deliberately a much\nmore representative body\nand people from all over\nthe College, different\nacademic departments,\ndifferent administrative\ndepartments, professors\nand students are on it.\nThere\u2019s lots of representation around the table\nthere. The forum I see as\na representative group and\na kind of listening post to\nbasically pool information\nfrom ground level up. So\nthe forum was very much\ninvolved in helping to\ndraft it as well. I came up\nwith a skeleton outline\nin January, which was\ndiscussed at the strategy\ngroup and then it was\ndeveloped and then it\nwas discussed again at\nthe forum and then it had\nanother discussion at the\nstrategy group in May\nand then a fully developed\nversion was then presented to the Provost\u2019s board\nat the end of June for approval and then adoption.\nClearly, we want to be\nas inclusive as possible so\nthat, whoever you are, if\nyou apply here and you\u2019ve\ngot the wherewithal to\nstudy the courses or to\ndo the research, then we\nwant you. There\u2019s clear\nevidence that, if you bring\npeople from other backgrounds and perspectives,\nthat can help you generate\na much more creative\napproach to how you re-search, how you teach and\nalso helps to dictate what\nyou research, what you\nteach. If we start asking\ndifferent questions then\npeople who don\u2019t normally look to Imperial as\na place where they might\ngo might say, \"actually the\nstuff they\u2019re interested in\nis the stuff I\u2019m interested\nin\" and so that becomes\nthen a pull on them.\nOver the summer it was\nrefined and it was also discussed in the President\u2019s\nExecutive groups. We got\na version that\u2019s published.\nWe\u2019ve been rolling it out\nwith announcements. Chi\nOnwurah came on the\n11th and I deliberately\ninvited Chi because\nshe chairs an all party\nparliamentary group on\ndiversity in STEM, which\nis newly created this year.\nShe\u2019s also an alumna of\nthis university, She was\na woman at Imperial; she\nwas a black woman at\nImperial and she was the\nonly person in the room\nof those characteristics for\na lot of the time. Didn\u2019t\nhave a very happy time\nat Imperial and is very\nclearly invested in this\narea and had said, basi-cally, that a lot of Russell\ngroup universities simply\naren\u2019t doing enough yet\nin terms of opening the\ndoors to underrepresented\nminorities. If you invite an\nMP, I kind of figured it\u2019s a\ngood way to launch it and\nshow that we are really\ninterested in starting conversation about this and\nI would like to try and\nramp up the number of\nevents that are promoting\nprolonging this conversation and getting people\ninvolved in participating\nWe now have a strat-egy. There are 7 major\nelements to it, the \u201cWe\nWill\u201d statements detailed\nin the document. The\ndocument also then has an\naction plan and the action\nplan has owners who are\ndistributed all across the\nCollege, all the way from\nthe President to Heads of\nDepartment. Now this is\njust a piece of paper at the\nminute, and it was hard\nenough work to do that, let\nme tell you. But the hard\nbit starts now because the\nhard bit is delivery and\nthat\u2019s where we need to\nfocus now.\nStephen Curry, Imperial's Assistant Provost for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion // Imperial College London\nIn a lot of places,\nImperial has the right\nsentiment behind\nwhat they say but it\nalmost comes across\nas they\u2019re paying\nlip service to it... in\nterms of actual things\nhappening, there\u2019s\nvery slow progress if\nany progress is made\nat all. How do you\nplan to implement the\n\"We Will\" statements?\nSome of it is in the\naction plan. Some of it,\nto be frank, we haven\u2019t\nworked out exactly how\nwe\u2019re going to do it but\nthere are certain targets\nthat we want to try and\nachieve so we have real\naction. I\u2019m very aware\nthat you can write a lot of\nfine words in a strategy\nand nice aspirations, and\nI agree that in this space,\ntalking about EDI around\nthe higher educational\nsector generally, not just\nin the UK but across the\nworld, people have been\ntalking about these issues\nfor a long time. If you\ntalk to women academics,\nthey\u2019re incredibly frus-trated; we know what the\nproblems are to a large\nextent but we don\u2019t really\nsee a big pace of change.\nOne of the difficulties is\nthere isn\u2019t a silver bullet\nthat solves this. What\nwe\u2019re dealing with is a\nsociety that has many\nstructural inequalities\nbuilt into it and we are a\nproduct of that society.\nNow, as a university, I\nwould like to think that\nwe were a space that actually challenged the norms\nof society and says, \"we\ncan do better\", and start\nto lead the conversation\nin doing that. Oxford\nand Cambridge attract a\nlot of attention because\neverybody\u2019s heard of\nOxford and Cambridge,\nso they get it in the neck\nin the press in terms\nof numbers of women,\nnumbers of black students\nthat they have, but our\nnumbers, I\u2019m afraid,\naren\u2019t really significantly\ndifferent from theirs. We\ncan be grateful for their\nexistence because they\ntake a lot of the heat, as it\nwere. We have to be very\nclear-sighted and look at\nour numbers and see what\nit is that we\u2019re doing. On\nadmissions for example,\nwe know we have issues\nwith attracting certain\nminority groups and there\nis, I would say, very much\na renewed determination\nthat we\u2019re going to have\nto change that.\nare. Your A level results is\nbasically a result of your\ninnate abilities multiplied\nby your social advantages\nor disadvantages. I think\nwe have to recognise that\nit\u2019s not a matter of compromising on standards.\nIncreasing diversity is not\nabout saying \u201coh well,\nwe let in a few minority\nstudents because it looks\ngood\". That\u2019s really not\nthe position we\u2019re taking.\nThe strategy makes it\nclear that there are groups\nof talented students out\nthere that we\u2019ve been\nneglecting and that we\u2019re\nnot really open to and it\u2019s\nabout recognising that, ac-tually, they\u2019re every bit as\ngood as the students that\ncome here but we\u2019re not\ndoing a good enough job\nof recognising the talents\nthat they have. Now how\nwe do that is a complicated process. Some of\nit will be our admissions\nprocesses, some of it will\nbe about actually going\nout and doing outreach\nand showing people that\nyou should be aspiring\nto Imperial College, you\nhave got it in yourself.\nThere\u2019s an issue with\nnot enough girls doing\nphysics for example and\nthat\u2019s because they get\nthe message early on,\nsometimes from their\nparents, sometimes from\ntheir teachers, that \u201cgirls\ndon\u2019t do physics\u201d and\nnonsense like that. But\nthere are many other\nareas where people get\nthat message and those\nare things that we have to\nfight against. So there has\nto be movement across\nbroad fronts, which is\nwhy the problem is deep\nseated, the solutions are\nmultidimensional and\ncomplex and I do hope\nthat the strategy gives us\na framework to be more\ncoherent and more joined\nup in our approach. We\nare going to take various\nsteps, we\u2019re not entirely\nsure that those are going\nto be the right steps to\ntake. We will remain open\nto challenge and, if we\nget things wrong, then\nwe will hold our hands up\nand say \u201cok that doesn\u2019t\nseem to be working, we\u2019re\ngoing to try something\nelse\u201d. There\u2019s an inherent\nproblem in any large\norganisation that people\ndon\u2019t know how it really\nworks. That\u2019s a problem\nof communication and it\u2019s\na problem that we need\nto tackle. People very\nreadily get very cynical\nabout \u201cwhy is the university doing this?\u201d, \u201cis this\njust so we can produce a\nnice, glossy brochure with\na picture of a disabled\nperson on the front of it or\na black member of staff?\",\n\"is this just PR?\u201d. I very\nmuch hope it\u2019s not. I am\ndetermined as far as I am\nable to make sure that this\nis about real change. Very\nmuch the ethos of the\nstrategy is that promoting\nEDI is the responsibility\nof everybody who comes\nto work or study here. It\u2019s\neverybody\u2019s responsibility from the President to\nthe very last undergraduate who\u2019s come through\nour doors. It has to be\nabout community, it has\nto be about the culture of\nthe place. We know there\nare many issues we have\nto tackle. There will be\nendless arguments over\nthis. We will not move fast\nenough for some people.\nWe will be moving too\nfast for others that... don\u2019t\nreally understand the\ndifferent experiences that\nother people have. I think\nthat is one of the issues\nin universities - they\u2019re\ndominated by white men.\nOne of the things I want\nto do is to make sure those\nother voices are heard.\nYou mention that\nuniversities are\ndominated by white\nmen. It\u2019s kind of funny\nthat the person in\ncharge of EDI is a\nwhite male.\nYou\u2019re right, it does\nfeel slightly anomalous.\nWe produced a leaflet to\nget members of staff to\ncomplete the Race Equality Charter survey and it\nhad my face on it! It is a\nbit odd and that is an issue\nbut I think there\u2019s value,\nat least temporarily, in\nthat you have somebody\nwho is a white man, who\nis prepared to take these\nissues seriously and to\nspeak to his colleagues\nabout it. One of the important things I can do is to\nhelp enable other voices\nto be heard. I\u2019ve been\nshocked to learn about\nthe experience of other\npeople. From women\nabout how prevalent\nsexual harassment is in\nhigher education. I have\nno experience of it whatsoever but I know, from\ntalking to women, that it\nis a big, hidden issue.\nUniversities are com-munities, the word university means community\nof students and scholars\nand I think we have, to a\ndegree, lost sight of that.\nBecause of the way that\ngovernment accountability is now enforced,\nuniversities have become\nmore managerialist in a\nway and a bit more cor-porate, rather than a bit\nmore communitarian and\nI am determined to try and\npush things in the other\ndirection.\nWhat does diversity\nmean to you\nspecifically and what\nare your priorities?\nDiversity is about\nrecognising and valuing\ndifference and the fact\nthat people are different,\nbring different things to\na university experience.\nIt\u2019s also about us being\nmuch more cognisant of\nthe fact that people can\nbe very different from us\nbut have really fantastic\nthings of value to offer\nus and experiences and\nperspectives and insights\nfrom their lived experience that bring real value\nto a university and clearly\nhave every bit as much\ntalent as anybody who\nconforms to the \u201cnorm\u201d\nview. Inclusion is really\nan important part of that\nbecause it\u2019s not enough\nthat you are getting people\nin the door. You have to\nmake sure that, when they\nare here, that they don\u2019t\nfeel excluded in any sense,\nthat they\u2019re not treated or\nsubject to microaggres-sions of any sort. Things\nlike that... degrade the\nday-to-day experience of\npeople who are generally\nfrom underrepresented\ngroups and that\u2019s a hard\nproblem to crack. We are a\nproduct of a society that\u2019s\nfragmented in many ways.\nEverybody has a\nlimited set of experiences and actually one\nof the great purposes of\nuniversity in the modern\nage in a big metropolitan\ncentre like London ought\nto be to enable people to\ncome together and we\ndo that. There\u2019s a lot of\ngood stuff happening, it\u2019s\nnot all doom and gloom.\nImperial is very international and that\u2019s one of\nthe great things about, I\nwould hope, being here as\na student is that actually\nthere is a good mix of different people. It\u2019s not the\nentire mix that we would\nlike necessarily but there\nis that.\nI have a slightly funny\nposition here. I\u2019m Assistant Provost but I don\u2019t\nhave a big team under me.\nIn a way, I kind of almost\nsee myself as being appointed to a position as a\nprofessional campaigner\nwithin the university and\nmy job is to campaign and\npersuade people that this\nis important, this is why\nwe need to do it, there\u2019s\nreal value here and to\nnegotitate that. The thing I\nwant to really achieve is to\nmake sure anybody who\u2019s\nin a managerial position\nis really invested in this.\nI just want to make sure\nthat everybody is talking\nabout these issues and\naware of them. Ultimately\nit will be seeing a change\nin number, I want to see\nmore women academics\nin senior positions here,\nI was to see more BME\nstaff in senior positions\nhere, I want more BAME\nstudents to come here.\nWe also know that\nthe reality is, we are\nlosing out on talent and\nthat\u2019s the argument that\nI would always make\nabout striving to increase\ndiversity. We have lots\nof privately educated\nkids, lots of white male\nstudents, many of whom\nhave had socio-economic\nadvantages even if they\ndidn\u2019t go to private\nschool. But there are\nmany communities where\nthere are lots of bright\nkids but, for one reason\nor another, they simply\ndon\u2019t look to Imperial as\na place that they would\ngo. They don\u2019t see other\npeople who look like them\nhere and that puts them\noff and we have work to\ndo to counteract that. It\u2019s\nnot College policy yet but,\npersonally, I would like to\nmove to a situation where\nwe are doing a much\nbetter job of providing\ncontext sensitive offers\nto students. I think if you\njust think about \u201cwe will\ntake people on the basis\nof their A level results\nbecause that\u2019s a good\nmeasure of how good they\nare\u201d, that\u2019s an incomplete\nmeasure of how good they\n\n"

FAANG stocks,\nwhich had previously\npowered the recent post\ncrisis bull run, had more\nthan $1 trillion wiped off\ntheir market cap leaving\nthe tech heavy NASDAQ\nbenchmark heading for its\nworst quarterly loss since\nthe turmoil that ensued\nafter the Lehman\u2019s collapse in 2008. Goldman\nSachs cut its price target\non Apple\u2019s stock for a\nthird time this month from\n$209 to $182, citing deteriorating Chinese demand\nand a stronger dollar.\nGoldman analyst Rod\nHall said, \u201cThe market\nnow points to Apple being\nat the limit of their price\npremium for the iPhone\u2026\nwhen pricing power is\nlost, consumer technology\ncompanies tend to lose\nmargins or market share\nor both\u201d. Consequently,\nApple stocks have fallen\n24% since the early\nOctober high, shedding\n$265 billion of market\nvalue; more the market\ncap of Pfizer, Wells Fargo\nand Chevron. This swan\ndive reverberated through\nthe global markets, with\nthe FTSE All-World\nindex declining 1.7% on\nTuesday and the Cboe\nGlobal Markets Vix\nequity volatility climbing\nwell above its long-term\naverage. It also had an\nunexpected effect on the\nfixed income market, with\nUS treasury prices edging\nof Oz, is how highly rated\nbonds are beginning to\nfail to provide their usual\nsafety, making portfolio\nprotection and hedging\ntechniques much harder.\nInterestingly, the greatest\nexample that the market\nentering a new regime\nis how the \u201cbuy the dip\u201d\ntechnique (the dominant\nmotto of the post crisis\nenvironment) is no\nlonger providing returns.\nAccording to Morgan\nStanley, buying the S&P\n500 after a week when\nreturns were negative had\nbeen a profitable strategy\nsince 2002, but recently\n\u201cBTD\u201d traders have been\ncaught out saying \u201cWhile\n2018 is clearly not a year\nof recession, the market\nis speaking loudly that\nbad news is coming\u201d.\nAlthough few think a recession is coming as early\nas next year, Scott Minerd,\nchief investment officer\nat Guggenheim Partners,\nsays he is beginning to jog\n-albeit not run- towards\nexiting the market saying,\n\u201cThe bottom line is that a\nrecession is coming, and\nit is imperative to prepare\nnow for the period leading\nup to the downturn\u201d. It\nis no surprise then that\nthe Federal Reserve has\nbeen increasing rates\nand shrinking its balance\nsheet, lifting three-month\nTreasury bills- the Feds\nway of increasing its cash\nreserves.\nOn a lighter note,\nsome investors note that\nthe recent volatility has\nbeen healthy, finally\nshaking markets out of\nthe dangerous inactivity\nthe Goldilocks post crisis\nenvironment, where weak\ngrowth kept inflation\nat bay and money was\npumping out of central\nbanks. Additionally, an\nuncorrelated market\nprovidespotentialforlarge\nalpha return for hedge\nfunds. Although the stock\nmarket correction over the\npast two months has hurt\na lot of investors, a small\ngroup of bearish hedge\nfunds managers their\ntime has arrived. Crispin\nOdey, founding partner at\nOdey Asset Management,\nhas made gains of about\n50% this year and 7%\nthis month, making it\none of the top performing\nhedge funds this year. His\nview is that downwards\nmarket momentum is very\ndifficult to halt when it is\ncoupled with expensive\nequity valuations, \u201cthe\nonly way it\u2019s been halted\nhas been lower interest\nrates, and that\u2019s not an\noption\u201d.\n\u201cOdey Asset\nManagement\nhas made\ngains of about\n50% this\nyear and 7%\nthis month,\nmaking it one\nof the top\nperforming\nhedge funds\nthis year\u201c\nhigher towards the 3%\nlevel. Rising US interest\nrates have tripped up\nthe global economy this\nyear, with a large share of\nthe bond universe losing\nmoney in 2018. Although\nissuance has remained\nstrong, the Bloomberg\nBarclays Multiverse has\nlost $1.34 trillion of its\nmarket capitalisation this\nyear. This is most likely\ndue to central banks paring\nback monetary stimulus,\nstopping programmes\nsuch as quantitative\neasing and rising interest\nrates. Still parallel declines in both bonds and\nequities are rare since\nstocks do better when\ngrowth is robust and fixed\nincome markets thrive\npoor economic condi-tions. For example, in the\n2008 financial crisis when\nthe global equity market\nshrank by more than $18\ntrillion, the bond market\nsurvived as investors were\ndesperate for the relative\nsafety it offers.

But have\nyou thought of lemon as a\nhealth hack? Discover 12\nmore uses below.\n1) Fever\nLemon juice aids in\ncuring general sicknesses\nsuch as flus, colds and\nfevers. Lemons induce\nperspiration in the body,\nwhich helps to break\nfever. Thanks to its\nvitamin C content and\nantiseptic properties, it is\nperfect for resolving lost\nvoices, tonsillitis, and all\nsorts of other respiratory\nailments you might catch.\nConsume by drinking it\nin a glass of warm water\nwith honey \u2013 basically\nlike warm lemonade?\n2) Sore Throat\nThe anti-bacterial properties of lemon are helpful\nin curing infections and\nsoreness in the throat. You\ncan simply imbibe lemon\njuice with water or drink\nlemon tea. Additionally,\nlemon raises our body\u2019s\nnatural immune system.\nAnd don\u2019t forget lemon\u2019s\nhigh vitamin C content\nwhen you suffer from\nthese illnesses!\n3) Nerves &\nTroubled Sleep\nAt bedtime, it is ideal\nto drink a lemon flower\ninfusion (if you can get\nyour hands on some, that\nis). Put three of these in\nboiling water, let them\nsit a few minutes and you\nhave your infusion, ready\nto calm your body and\ndrift you away...\n4) Relaxation\nLemon is a great\naromatic agent that can\nrelax your feet if you use it\nas a tool in a DIY spa.Add\nlemon juice to lukewarm\nwater and dip your feet\nin it. It will relax your\nmuscles and will help you\nget rid of foot odour, as\nwell as soothe tired soles\nand heal blisters.\n5) Detoxification\nLemons are excellent\ncleansers for our bodies;\nthey eliminate toxins,\npurify, and are undoubtedly one of the best health\nallies. Did you know\nthat having a large glass\nof warm water mixed\nwith lemon juice in the\nmorning not only helps\nin weight loss but also\nhelps your digestive tract\nand liver? This alkaline\nsolution can be looked\nupon as an overall body\ndetoxifier.\n6) Cough\nHeat a few teaspoons\nof honey and add the juice\nof one lemon in half a cup\nof hot water. Drink the\nmixture slowly and your\ncough will disappear. In\naddition, it is common to\nuse garlic cloves to aid\nthe miraculous benefits\nof lemon - in this case,\ncut two in half and let\nthem soak a few hours\nin lemon juice. The\nflavor (and your breath\nafterwards) will seem a\nbit strong, but eating these\nlemon-flavoured garlic\ncloves is an excellent and\nunconventional method\nfor reducing coughs.\n7) Immunity\nIts nutritional composition composed of vitamins\nC, B, and E, and its many\nminerals, such as potassi-um, magnesium, calcium,\nand sulphur make lemons\nan incredible strengthener\nfor our immune system.\nThey raise our white\nblood cell count in the\nlong term.\n8) Dental Care\nSurprising as it may\nseem with its acidity;\nlemon juice is good for\nmaintaining dental health.\nIf you are suffering\nfrom problematic gum\nbleeding, apply lemon\njuice to get rid of it (it\nwill sting, but for a good\ncause). Lemon juice can\nalso provide relief from\ntoothaches and solve the\nissue of bad breath.\n9) pH Balance\nTo maintain and\nupgrade your health,\nit is necessary to keep\nthe body\u2019s pH slightly\nalkaline, and what better\noption than lemons to\ndo so? The alkalinity of\nlemons pushes our body\nto attain the required pH\nstate, which resultantly\naids in improved general\nheath and reduces risk of\ncertain diseases, such as\ncancer.\n10) Nosebleeds\nNose bleeding is a\ncommon problem that\noccurs mainly in summer\ndue to increased pressure\non blood cells. However,\nlemons have shown to be\nan excellent remedy for\nstopping nosebleeds. You\ncan dip a cotton ball in\nlemon juice and apply it\ndirectly inside your nose\n\u2013 unpleasant as it may\nseem, it will stop your\nnosebleed!\n11) Travel\nSickness\nIf you tend to feel\nsick when travelling,\nlemon again comes to\nthe rescue. Dilute lemon\njuice with water, and you\nhave a superb solution\nfor treating vomiting and\ntravel sickness. Nibbling\non a small wedge of\nlemon can also cure such\ndisorders fast.\n12) Insect Bites\nThis is an ancient\nremedy where lemon juice\nis applied on the affected\narea to cure insect stings\nand bites. Although the\neffects are not likely to\nbe felt instantly, lemon is\nbelieved to suck out the\npoison, thereby curing\nitching and pain in the\nlong term.\nIf you think lemons are only helpful in tequila shots, then you need to take a second look - read this article to\nupdate your concepts about the therapeutic powers of lemons\u2026 after all, it\u2019s easy peasy lemon squeezy!\nJuicy lemons growing on a lemon tree in sunny Italy // Phxere\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1706\nFELIX\nTECH tecfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n9\nA new way to say \u2018Hello!\u2019 to the World of coding\nP\nrogramming is,\nfor those who\ndon\u2019t know anything about it, a\nmysterious and intimidating subject. However, at\nany point in our careers,\nwe might be placed in\na situation where some\ncoding knowledge is\nneeded. And not only\nthere: it is enough to look\nat the media, or more\nspecialized websites to be\nconfronted with technical\nwords, such as algorithms,\nmachine learning, data\nscience.\nWhatever the reason, it\nis never too late to learn.\nAnd no need to undertake\nyear-long courses that\nwill not give a proper\ninsight into the applications of coding. An online\nresource, SmartStack.me,\ndeveloped by students\nin Imperial, is targeted\nat those who would like\nto produce their own\napplications but may not\nhave the confidence to get\nthemselves started.\nSmartStack.me is\na recent initiative.\nLaunched at the beginning\nof this academic year, it\noffers free opportunities\nto quickly get started\nand learn how to code.\nDeveloped originally by\n3 Medic students in fifth\nyear after spending their\nintercalated Bachelor\nyear in the department of\nBioengineering, they have\nthe personal experience\nof learning a completely\nnew subject and learn to\nthink \u201cthe engineering\nway\u201d. By now, the team\nhave expanded, and\ncomprises students (most\nfrom Imperial) with\nbackgrounds such as Des\nEng, Geophysics and\nBiological Sciences. Point\nto note: no computing\nstudent (yet)..\nThe concept of the\nwebsite is simple: it\nprovides a quick guide-through the concepts\nof coding and initiates\nthe user to the Google\nCollaboratory text editor,\nbasically a free Jupyter\nNotebook (allows user\nto code in Python in\ncode cells and mixes it\nwith text cells). Google\nCollaboratory works like\nmost Google products:\nit is available online,\naccessible to anyone with\na valid google address and\nis sharable on Drive.\nSmartStack.me helps\nthose with no previous\nprogramming experience\nthrough the Google\nCollaboratory notebook.\nEngaging, it is illustrated\nwith screenshots and very\nclear and concise information that anybody would\nwish had in labs. After the\ninitiation to the notebook,\nlearning takes place by\nstraight away tackling\npractical applications:\nData Science with Breast\nCancer Data, Machine\nLearning with Chest\nX-rays, SIRA Criteria\nCalculator using a simple\nprogram. Key to success:\n\u201ccool and trendy words\u201d:\nMachine Learning, data\nanalysis, all of that mixed\nwith the life-changing\nvocabulary of medicine,\nprovides the perfect blend\nto an interesting online\nresource.\nNow, I would like\nto make a point. Not\neveryone can instantly\nbecome an expert pro-grammer, specialist in a\nprogramming language.\nHowever, I believe it is\nimportant to make coding\nmore accessible, to people\nfrom all ranges and sexes.\nSimple programs are what\nseparates nowadays scientific research to the one\nof last centuries. It would\nbe a missed opportunity\nto spend so much time\nmanually analysing data\nwhen super-fast computers can help us make the\ntask faster. So, to those\nfeeling too intimidated\nby coding to start their\nown applications, do not\nlet this slow you down. It\nis never too late to learn,\ndevelop your own applications and projects, and,\neventually, change the life\nof many.\nTECH\nAline Buat\nTech Writer\nif (coding = = 0) { TryOutSmartStack() ; } // StackSmart.me\n\u201cLearning\ntakes place\nby straight\naway tackling\npractical\napplications\u201d\n\u201cSmartStack ...\noffers for free\nopportunities\nto quickly get\nstarted and\nlearn how to\ncode\u201d\nThis week in the tech section, we will talk about an initiative lead by Imperial students to make code learning\naccessible and entertaining to students from all backgrounds.\n\n"
