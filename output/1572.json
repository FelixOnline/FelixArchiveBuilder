Even after all those\nyears encased in ice, it\u2019s still deadly.\nBut this isn\u2019t the plot of a low-budget\nhorror ilm. his is real science.\nIf you\u2019re feeling worried, don\u2019t panic.\nFortunately for most of our readers,\nthis particular virus is only deadly\nif you happen to be an amoeba. But\neven so, the fact that a microbe could\nstill be infectious after such a long\ntime in \u2018hibernation\u2019 raises a worrying\nthought. Could human diseases like\nsmallpox, that we have managed\nto subdue, be released into the\nenvironment by melting permafrost?\nResearchers at Aix-Marseille\nUniversity discovered the virus in\nan ice core taken 30m underground\nin the far northeast of Russia. Once\nthey had defrosted it, they discovered\nthat it could still invade an amoeba,\nhijacking the cell\u2019s apparatus to make\ncopies of itself. his is the irst time\nthat a virus this old has been shown to\nstill be infectious. With rising global\ntemperatures, this may suggest the\npossibility of more dangerous ancient\nviruses emerging from the ice.\nhe team\u2019s investigations, published\nin the journal PNAS, show the virus\nin question is remarkable for more\nreasons than just longevity. At 1.5\nmicrometres in length, Pithovirus\nsibericum is the largest virus ever\ndiscovered, and is similar in size to\nmany bacteria. It\u2019s more than ten\ntimes the size of an average lu virus\n(usually around 50-100 nanometres),\nand is so big that it can even be seen\nthrough a regular light microscope. It\ncontains over 500 genes \u2013 50 times the\nnumber found in a typical lu virus.\nPithovirus is one of a number of\ngiant viruses to have been discovered\nin recent years. In 1992, scientists in\nBradford identiied what they thought\nwas a new type of bacterium, but it\nwas only in 2003 that it was shown\nto actually be a huge virus. Just last\nyear, another, named Pandoravirus,\nwas discovered in a sample from the\ncoast of Chile. Under the microscope,\nthey have a fairly broad range of sizes,\nalthough their shapes and structures\nappear alike.\nBut surprisingly, despite their\nexternal similarities, there are\nsigniicant biological diferences\nbetween them. Pandoravirus has\nabout 5 times as many genes (about\n2,500) as Pithovirus, and the two share\nonly a handful of proteins. hey also\nattack other cells in diferent ways:\nPandoravirus uses the cell nucleus\nto replicate, whereas Pithovirus only\nrequires structures in the cytoplasm.\nheir evolutionary relationships,\nthough, remain a mystery. he\nunique features of these viruses\nhave led to speculation that they\nmay constitute a fourth domain of\nlife, alongside eukaryotes (such as\nplants and animals), bacteria and\nH\now can the body change\nhow a gene acts without\nchanging the DNA\nsequence of said gene?\nPart of the answer lies\nwith epigenetics: alterations to a\ngenome that don\u2019t happen by messing\nwith the nucleotide sequence of DNA\nbut by changing how the gene is\nexpressed.\nCommon changes include DNA\nmethylation, which normally\nsuppresses gene expression, and\nthe addition or removal of histone\nproteins from a gene sequence.\nHistones act like spools, winding\nup DNA so that it doesn\u2019t take up as\nmuch space as it ultimately could.\nEpigenetic diferences are being\nfound in an almost-unlimited number\nof diseases: cancer, epilepsy, arthritis,\nobesity. A recent paper published in\nPLoS Genetics has now found that\nepigenetic changes may inluence how\nsusceptible one is to type 2 diabetes.\nType 2 diabetes develops happens\nwhen your pancreas either doesn\u2019t\nproduce enough insulin to maintain\na normal blood glucose level \u2013\ncalled insulin deiciency \u2013 or your\nbody is unable to use the insulin\nthat is produced, known as insulin\nresistance. Insulin is responsible for\nthe absorption of glucose from the\nblood, generating cellular energy.\nResearchers from Lund University in\nSweden compared cells that produce\ninsulin in healthy individuals to those\nwho sufer from type 2 diabetes. hey\nfound that over 800 genes in diabetic\nindividuals have epigenetic changes\nthat aren\u2019t observed in healthy people.\n102 of these epigenetic alterations\nwere proved to cause diferential gene\nexpression in diabetic individuals.\nUltimately some of the afected\ngenes contribute to reduced insulin\nproduction, which can be one of the\nunderlying causes of type 2 diabetes.\nType 2 diabetes is typically treated\nby changing one\u2019s diet and exercising\nregularly, to maintain normal blood\nglucose levels. But as the disease\ncannot be cured, treatment may\neventually include using medication\nto control blood glucose levels.\nCharlotte Ling, who led the study,\nsaid, \u201c[Our research] can help us to\nunderstand why people develop the\ncondition. his also opens the way for\nthe development of future drugs.\u201d\nFurthermore, the researchers found\nthat the epigenetic changes identiied\nin diabetic individuals \u201chad already\ntaken place in healthy subjects as a\nresult of age or high BMI (body mass\nindex)\u201d.\nhis suggests that these changes may\nbe contributing to the pathogenesis of\ntype 2 diabetes. Future research can\nuse this work to identify new target\ngenes for therapy.\n\u201cUnlike genes that can\u2019t be changed,\nepigenetic changes are reversible,\u201d\nsaid Tasnim Dayeh. In fact, drugs\nthat cause epigenetic changes have\nlong been used in the treatment of\ncancer and epilepsy. his lends further\nsupport to the hope that this work\ncould be important in developing\ntreatment drugs.\nPerhaps one day the stigma of\nsufering from \u2018self-inlicted\u2019 diabetes\n\u2013 type 2 diabetes being a condition\narchaea. Whatever their true origin,\nthe discovery of these giant viruses,\nand the huge variation between them,\nhas been a vivid demonstration of the\nextreme diversity of microbial life.\nJuLIA BARtOLI / ChANtAL ABERgEL / IgS / CNRS / AMu\nPithovirus sibericum will eat you alive... if you\u2019re an amoeba.

    "content": "28 FRIDAY 14 MAR\nTELEVISION\nEditors: John Park,\nEmily Fulham\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe West Wing: A Retrospective\nT\nhe West Wing is widely\nacknowledged to be the best\npolitical drama ever shown\non American television. he\nseven series were broadcast\nfrom 1999 to 2006, premiering\nthe same year as Bill Clinton\u2019s\nimpeachment trial and inishing in the\ndepths of George Bush\u2019s second term,\nwhen the president had an approval\nrating of just 37%. Although the show\nnever pretended to be an accurate\nrepresentation of a president\u2019s\nadministration, the inluences of real\nlife are plain to see. It\u2019s been said since\nthe show ended that he West Wing\nwas a portrayal of an idealised Clinton\nadministration, and it\u2019s true that there\nare easy parallels to draw between\nClinton and Jed Bartlet, the ictional\nDemocrat president in the show: both\ncharismatic, highly intellectual, and\nplagued by scandal throughout their\npresidency.\nOne accusation often levelled at\nthe show\u2019s creator, Aaron Sorkin, was\nthat The West Wing was too idealistic\nand failed to show the dirty reality of\npolitics. Bartlet\u2019s administration, and\nthose closest to him, do have a strong\nsense of morality and seem remarkably unjaded from having worked in\nthe White House for so long. And\nyet it\u2019s refreshing to watch something\nthat\u2019s hopeful about politics for a\nchange, that shows a President who\u2019s\nstruggling to do his best but trying to\nmake the right decision. In the first\nseries, the team is frustrated with the\nlack of things accomplished by the\nadministration so far, due to a difficult and uncompromising opposition\nparty and Bartlet\u2019s fear of not getting\nre-elected. Midway through, in one of\nthe best episodes of the show (Let Bartlet be Bartlet), these frustrations culminate in a great scene between the\nPresident and his Chief of Staff, Leo\nMcGarry, and an inspirational speech\nthat would give even the most cynical\nviewer some faith in politics.\nOn its inception, Sorkin never intended the President to have a large\nrole in the show, preferring instead\nto focus on the staff surrounding\nhim: his Chief of Staff, Communications Director and their deputies,\nand Press Secretary. However, Martin\nSheen was pretty much perfect casting for the role of Jed Bartlet, making\nthe character such an interesting one\nthat it would have made no sense to\nrelegate him to a secondary role. One\nof the major story arcs of the first few\nseries is the discovery that the President suffers from MS, which he covered up during his election campaign.\nAfter the revelation is made public,\nhe faces questions as to his competence for the job and an investigation\ninto whether he defrauded the public.\nClearly, the similarities between this\nand the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal\nare deliberate, and although they illustrate very different character flaws\nin their respective Presidents, it\u2019s still\nan effective way to examine the relationship between politicians and the\nelectorate they serve, and how open\npublic figures should be about their\nprivate lives.\nIn addition to Sheen, the supporting cast is also outstanding. Seven of\nthe cast won Emmys over the course\nof the show, several more than once.\nIt also jumpstarted the career of Rob\nLowe, who, as Deputy Chief of Staff,\nwas a main character on the show until his departure during season four,\nand Dul\u00e9 Hill, the President\u2019s Aide,\nwho went on to star in Psych.\nMuch of the drama in The West\nWing comes not from scandals, but\nthe reality of policymaking and cam-paigning. One episode follows the\nattempt of an elderly senator to filibuster a bill, requiring him to stand\nup and talk without stopping for more\nthan eight hours; another details the\nchaos that ensues after Josh Lyman,\nthe Deputy Chief of Staff, is forced to\nstand in for the Press Secretary at a\nbriefing. Lyman, unfamiliar with dealing with journalists, allows himself to\nbe wound up to the point where he\nsarcastically tells a roomful of press\nthat the President has a \u2018secret plan to\nfight inflation,\u2019 only to be taken at his\nword.\nThat\u2019s not to say that The West Wing\ncan\u2019t tackle heavier material when it\nneeds to. One scene which has become infamous even outside of the\nshow\u2019s legacy comes at the end of\nthe first series, when Bartlet is trying\nto decide whether to run for reelec-tion. After the loss of someone close\nto him, the President walks through a\ncathedral, venting his grief and anger\nto the God he\u2019s always believed in. It\u2019s\na scene that demonstrates the full acting capabilities of Martin Sheen and\nwhich remains moving after many\nviewings. The show is also capable of\nhandling a romantic subplot, featuring one of the longest will-they-won\u2019tthey plotlines on TV.\nSorkin has made a name for himself by writing witty, fast-paced dia-logue. Prior to The West Wing, he was\nmost famous for writing A Few Good\nMen, and went on to write the Oscarnominated screenplay for The Social\nNetwork (any doubts I had about the\nmaking of a film about Facebook were\ndispelled when I saw Sorkin\u2019s name at-tached). He also pioneered the \u2018walkand-talk\u2019 filming technique, where\ncameras follow the characters through\nthe corridors of the White House.\nIt\u2019s a technique which has since been\ncopied by many shows such as House,\nE.R. and Law & Order as a useful way\nof conveying a lot of exposition while\nretaining the audience\u2019s interest.\nAfter previously writing almost every episode, Sorkin left after the fourth\nseason. The first four series are generally considered superior, but there\u2019s\nvery little decline in quality in the final\nthree; the writing is still fantastic, and\nit gave the show a chance to explore\ndifferent storylines.\nSixteen years on, it\u2019s easy to dismiss\nThe West Wing as standard American\nfeel-good fare, particularly at a time\nwhen disillusionment with politics\nseems to be the default. There are moments where the show can be a little\ntoo pompous and a little too idealistic;\nit\u2019s difficult to muster a swell of patriotic pride every time a character gives\nan inspirational speech, particularly\nwhen it\u2019s not even your own country\nthey\u2019re talking about. It\u2019s a testament\nto Sorkin\u2019s writing that these speeches,\nwhich are pretty frequent, very rarely\nbecome tedious. For the most part,\nthe show is just hugely entertaining,\nand also educational, especially for\nnon-Americans: I now know enough\nabout the American political system\nto bullshit my way through most conversations about US politics, which\nturns out to be surprisingly useful.\nThere are very few reasons not to\nwatch The West Wing; it\u2019s got a fantastic cast and some of the best writing in a TV drama. Unfortunately, it\u2019s\nnot available on Netflix UK (although\nit is available on the US version), but\nyou can pick up the series boxsets for\npretty cheap online these days. Even if\nit doesn\u2019t inspire any great faith in pol-itics, it might just shake some of the\ncynicism out of even the most hardened skeptics. And if not, well, there\u2019s\nalways The Thick of It.\nEmily Fulham takes a nostalgic look back at the Bartlet administration\n\n"

Make no\nmistake, this is a tough ask though\nagainst a Reds outit in irresistible\nform. Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge look a match made in heaven\nand it is actually very hard to see\nUnited winning this even if decisions go their way and they get a\nbit of luck. Brendan Rodgers has a\ngolden opportunity to do the double\nover United and I think it\u2019s one he\nwill take. 1-2\nTottenham v Arsenal (Sunday 4pm,\nSky Sports 1)\nhe North London derby has added\nspice this year, with Spurs needing\na result to maintain any dwindling\nhopes of Champions League qualiica-tion, and Arsenal desperate for points\nin order to keep their title hopes alive.\nRealistically, whoever loses this will\nhave their dreams dashed for another\nyear. Tim Sherwood seems to get the\nmost out of his players on the road and\nSpurs always seem to struggle against\nthe big teams. hat said, the Gunners\nhave been blowing hot and cold of late\nand after a trip to Germany midweek,\nmay have to settle for a point. 1-1\nHull v Man City\nEven when City were scoring goals for\nfun, they would have expected a big\ntest at the KC Stadium because Steve\nBruce has his side well drilled against\nany opponent. hey have already beaten Liverpool and this will be tight but\nby hook or crook, City need to win. .\n1-3\nEverton v Cardiff:\nSince the appointment of Ole Gunnar\nSolskjaer, the Bluebirds have shown\nfew signs they are capable of a great\nescape. Everton have already had their\nblip and with Romelu Lukaku back\namong the goals, they will be strong\nfavourites and rightly so. 3-0\nAston Villa v Chelsea (Saturday\n5:30pm, Sky Sports 1):\nVilla inally produced an encouraging\nhome display after 4 goals in 17 minutes saw of Norwich last time out. By\nstark contrast, the Blues\u2019 defence has\nbeen rock solid of late. Jose Mourinho\nknows how to grind out 1-0 and 2-0\nwins at this stage of the season \u2013 he\nhas been there and done it before\nso many times \u2013 and he realises it is\nsimply about results and not perfor-mances, because they do not have the\nlair of Liverpool and Man City. his\nhas got \u201cChelsea win to nil\u201d written all\nover it.. 0-2\nFulham v Newcastle:\nGiven the Cottagers\u2019 perilous posi-tion, Felix Magath has had no settling\nin time. He needs his irst win and fast,\nbut the Magpies looked back to their\nbest at Hull last time out; their record\nat the Cottage is strong and they can\nput another nail in Fulham\u2019s coin. 1-2\nSouthampton v Norwich:\nhe Canaries badly need to start winning football matches as their run in\nat the end of the season is horrendous.\nMauricio Pochettino\u2019s Saints have\nbeen on the end of a couple of hidings\nat St Mary\u2019s Stadium recently and I\nsuspect they may just settle for a point\n1-1\nStoke v West Ham\nhe Hammers are virtually assured of\nsurvival after a brilliant run of form,\nbut there are few harder grounds to\npick up wins than the Britannia Stadium. Yes, they managed it last season,\nbut the Potters are still not safe and\nhave the greater incentive to deliver a\nresult. 1-0\nSunderland v Crystal Palace\nhese sides have produced some important workmanlike performances\nof late and I see both surviving the\ndrop. Tony Pulis\u2019 Palace side is made\nup of ighters and they will push the\nBlack Cats to the wire.

Now, though, they\nare battling for survival. Of the two,\nGarry Monk\u2019s Swans look better\nequipped in every department and\nthe Baggies\u2019 recent away form is\npoor. 2-1\nT\nhis year\u2019s Bottle Match, the\n112th since its conception,\nwas an away afair, battled out\nin Cornwall\u2019s looded depths. After\nnegotiations with staf a departure\ntime was settled, and at 1pm on Friday\n21st February 150 excitable students\nbegan their arduous trek to Newquay.\nDespite a questionable route through\ncentral Bristol at rush hour, and some\neven more questionable in-coach ilm\nchoices, we made good time, arriving\nat the campsite before 9pm.\nAfter wrestling with the caravan\u2019s\nminiature cooking appliances, the\nathletes among us hit the hay, with\nthe sensible supporters following\nsoon after. At 7am the coaches to\nCamborne got underway, delivering\nthe hockey players and footballers\nirst, followed by the supporters.\nhe irst ixture of the day was Ladies\nHockey, in which the girls fell behind\nearly. Soon they were 2-0 down, but\nundeterred. After an encouraged\ncomeback the RSM drew level, and\nthen surpassed their opponents,\neventually claiming a historic 3-2 win\nin what has consistently been a tough\nixture in recent years.\nhe Football team got underway at a\nrevisedtimeof10.30am,seeingamuch\nlarger crowd than they\u2019d experienced\nin recent years. his year\u2019s squad are\ncurrently top of their local league and\nwere expecting an upset against the\nrecently dominant Camborne outit.\nHowever, despite a number of shots\nand headers on goal, as well as a graze\nacross the woodwork, RSM couldn\u2019t\nind the back of the net. he CSM boys\nwere more fruitful, scoring 3 goals,\nthough all agreed the score-line did\nnot relect the match.\nMen\u2019s Hockey, not to be outdone\nby the female counterparts, chalked\nup a strong 3-0 victory, making it the\nirst time (that we know of) where the\nRSM has won both Hockey matches.\nBefore leaving for the Rugby Club\nthe two Mining Schools squared of\non the netball and basketball courts.\nWith an RSM victory in Squash (3-2) and a looding related cancellation\nin Golf, the RSM were leading 3\nmatches to 1 overall. Unfortunately\nthe pressure was too great, and both\nsides fell to their opponents, leaving\nthe weekend at a tie in the run up to\nthe Rugby.\nWe travelled to Penryn Rugby\nClub for the inal showdown, with\nall but the players looking somewhat\nworse for wear (and one or 2 having\nalready fallen by the wayside). Despite\namiable conditions that afternoon,\nthe adverse weather in recent days/\nweeks/months had taken its toll and\nthe pitch was heavy and sticky, making\nhard work for the players. In the end,\nthe relatively inexperienced RSM\nteam, with many representatives from\nthe MSc cohort (and one Chilean\ninternational), battled well to hold\nthe Camborne Miners to a 6-6 draw.\nhis resulted in a dead tie for the\nweekend overall. hanks to a strong\nwin at home in 2013, the RSM were\nthe current holders of the Bottle, and\nso retain the Bottle this year.\nFollowing the suspense of the sport\nwe all headed to the Rugby Club Bar\nfor a jar or two, pending the opening\nof the Camborne Student Union. At\n6.30pm, we made our way over for a\ndinner of curry, rice, and poppadoms.\nBasic as the meal was, it was nice of\nthe Camborne committee to heed our\nrequest not to serve pasties, which\nhave haunted us since 2012.\nhe night ended in traditional\nstyle with alcohol and a dance-loor\ntakeover at the Sailor\u2019s Arms in\nNewquay, followed by a sleepy taxi\nride home to the caravan site.
