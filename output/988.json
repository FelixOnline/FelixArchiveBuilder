    "content": "Opinion 23\nThe Munster Road Kitchen\nby Samin Ishtiaq\nRead this philosophy: If someone is weak then\nyou should bully him, 'cause it'll prepare him\nfor the cruel world outside. This is a sadistic\nversion of \"Nanny knows best\", I suppose, and\none which Nils adopts towards, for instance, his\nyounger brother. (Or, at least, he did adopt it\nwhile his brother was still shorter than him.)\nNils tells us with pride the way he would slap\nhis brother or lock him in his room. His claim\nthat it was good for him is something that we've\nargued about for a long time. Initially, Paul and I disagreed - but Paul, being Paul, soon came\naround to this sadistic point of view.\nI was nearly converted the other day. I was\njust beginning to bike onto Queen's Gate when\nthis woman driver stopped her car. She was\nobviously in a very agitated state, really ready to\ncry. And she shouted about trying to find the\nSculpture Department. At first I was going to\nmake a sarcastic remark about the value of art at\nImperial College, but I checked myself. I explained to her where the Royal College of Art\nwas and that their Sculpture Department was\nprobably somewhere nearby.\nIt doesn't pay to be kind, of course. I got an\near-bashing back s bout how she'd already been\nthere, about how late she was, about how she\nhad taken a wrong turn, etc, etc. At this point I was still intending to help her (my brownie point\nfor the day, I suppose). But, on being shouted at\nby this stupid woman, I was actually trying to\nhelp...If I just left her to it, she would actually\nfind out about this cruel world. (If Paul had been\nin my place, he would have very likely sent her\ntowards Earl's Court.)\nSo, I said to her: \"Look, if you're glint to\nshout at me I'm not really glint to help you.\" I put my cycling hat back on in a very deliberate\nway and pedalled off.\nSo far this has been my best attempt at the\nSadist Nanny philosophy. Most of the time I'm very helpful. But I fear that, as I get older and\nmore cynical, everyone will look like that\nwoman in Queen's Gate. So, if you want any\nfavours, ask me now. .\nCAREERS INFORMATION\nMilkround - Details of interviews are put up on\nthe noticeboard outside the Careers Office (level\n3, Sherfield building) a few days before the\ninterview date.

    "content": "News\nAvalanche\nKills\nDoctor\nBY MICHAEL INGRAM\nC& GCU Make Spanner Inviolate\nThe Guilds Mascotry Team ensuring that Spanner is safely returned to the Guilds Office\nafter its appearance at a Guilds event\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nCity and Guilds College Union\n(C& GU)Spanner and Bolt have\nbeen declared inviolate mascots by\nthe . The two mascots are to attend\nmore events in an attempt to\nincrease the awareness of their\nexistence and to restart an interest\nin mascot ry, according to a letter\ncirculated by the C& GU. Spanner\nand Bolt are now not allowed to be\n'kidnapped' by the other two\nconstituent college unions or other\nstudent unions until midnight on\n31st October 1994.\nFelix asked Steve Hoborough,\nC&GC U Vice-President, why the\naction had been taken. \" At the\nmoment the whole mascot ry thing\nhas died a death. Very few students\nseem to be interested in it anymore.\nIt's a shame, really, because people\nused to be proud of which college\nthey represented. It seems that\nthese days the average student is\nmore concerned about working\nhard and getting their degree; the\nfun side of being a part of the\nCollege is generally ignored. We're\n[C& GCU] hoping that seeing that\nthe union has two rather nice\nmascots might stir peoples pride.\nMascotry raises money for Rag\n(Unions have to pay a 'ransom' to\nget their mascot back) and is\nsupposed to be a fun game.\"\nInterest in mascot ry has\ndecreased enormously in recent\nyears following an accident in\nImperial College in 1991. During\nan attempted raid of Theta, the\nsix-foot brass thermometer and\nmascot of the Royal College of\nScience Union (RCSU), one bearer\nsuffered a broken leg. The bearer,\nSteve Dorman, was hit by a van\nduring a scuffle with the C&GC U raiders outside the Albert Hall. Joe\nFernley, of C&CG U, said at the\ntime \"One reason that everything...\ngot so serious is the fact that Theta\nhasn't been stolen for so long. This\nsets up a vicious circle where the\ncurrent bearers have so much pressure on them that they will do\nanything to protect their belove'd lump of stainless including not\nbringing it out for ages at a time.\"\nThe current 641b Spanner was\nmade in 1964 by the Mechanical\nEngineering Department. It was\ncast out of the brass from spent\ncartridges which the Rifle Club\ncollected over three years. Bolt was\ncast out of chrome steel three years\nlater. The last time Spanner and\nBolt were stolen, a ransom of\n\u00a31,320 was demanded (ten times\ntheir combined weight). Theta, who\ncelebrates her birthday on 20th February, hasn't been stolen since\n1973.\nMeanwhile the Imperial College\nUnion mascot, Mike the Micrometer, is acting as a very large\npaper weight in Andy Wensley's office and is keeping a low profile.\nA doctor who trained at St Mary's Hospital Medical School was one\nof the six skiers killed in an\navalanche on Saturday.\nThe accident, which took place\nat Val d 'Isere in the French Alps,\ncaused the death of five British\ndoctors and their French ski guide.\nThe last member of the party, Dr\nChristopher Ackner, survived,\nspending a night in sub-zero\ntemperatures in a snow hole.\nThe party were on the last day\nof a week long visit to the region,\nwhich combined a medical conference with a skiing holiday. Doctors\nHoward Fleet, Ann Gillingham,\nJeremy Gillingham, Jan Hofmeyr,\nClare Webber and guide Hugo\nFerrier were named on Sunday as\nthose who died. All members of the\nparty were accomplished skiers.\nThe avalanche occurred on\nSaturday morning, while the skiers\nwere on an off-p iste tour from\nTigres to Champagny. Although the\nhigh winds of the previous day had\neased, much of the area was still on\n'red flag' - the second highest level\nof avalanche alert.\nThe alarm was not raised until\nSunday morning. When mountain\nrescue helicopters picked up the\nalarm signals from the skiers'\nemergency bleep ers, they found\nfive of the party dead.\nOne of the dead, Dr Claire\nWebber (33), had qualified through\nthe University of London and\ntrained at St Mary's Hospital\nMedical School. She had a practice\nbased in Buckinghamshire, and was\ndescribed by a colleague as \"totally\nprofessional, the sort of woman you\ncould ring up at four o 'clock in the\nmorning and she wouldn't grumble.\" Her father said: \"She\nwas devoted to her profession and\nshe was also a great sportswoman.\nShe particularly loved skiing.\"\nThe Felix team would like to\nexpress their condolences to the\nfriends and relatives of those\ncaught in the avalanche.\nFront Cover photo by Mike\nChamberlain\nPhoto above by Simon Govier\nThe third article from the Student Counsellor is on page 4\n\n"

    "content": "Union 21\nThinking of running for a sabbatical post? Then here's a bit about what e ac of them involves and some dates for your diary. . .\nPresident\nThe President - who he? Whilst the\nother sabbaticals have specific areas\nof responsibility, the President is\nresponsible for the Union as a whole.\nI have to try ensure that the\nUnion is kept in a healthy state of\ndevelopment, from its structure to\nits work in all areas of College. I am\nresponsible for academic and welfare representation within College,\nthe representation of student opinion\ninside Imperial from its lowest to its\nhighest level. Outside IC, I have to\nrepresent the Union's members\nviews to all we come into contact\nwith. Inside the Union, I am\nresponsible with the Union Manager\nfor all staffing issues.\nHow is this done? As Dave says\nin his bit, by talking to people. This\ntakes up a huge chunk of every day,\ndiscussing issues with students,\nunion officers, staff and College\nofficials, anyone from a first year\nChemist to the Rector. After that,\nyou have to make sure that it has an\neffect, that people's concerns, problems and ideas are put into practice.\nOften this can take a lot of time,\nenergy and work. Sometimes ideas\nare not put into practise, problems\nare sometimes not solved. Although\nthis can be discouraging, you have\nto start again on a new issue or\nmaybe find a new angle to get an\nold problem resolved.\nThe job can and will take up a lot\nof time, but you meet a cross section\nof public and College life. There\nmay be problems ahead, but the\npersonal reward in succeeding to\nsolve is great. Like Charlie, I think\nit's a great post for job satisfaction\nbut like Dave, I'm glad I'm only\ndoing it for one year.\nTo know more, pop into the\nUnion Office, in Beit Quad, I'm free\nto talk to everyone about the job\nanytime (all questions answered).\nOr just give me a call, 3501 (work),\n3511 (home).\nDeputy President (Finance & Services)\nWhat do I do? Mainly, money,\ntrading and talking to people. The\nmoney side involves chairing the\nFinance Committee (which makes\ndecisions on the Union's finances,\nsuch as clubs and societies budgets),\nkeeping an eye on expenditure (I have to authorise any amount over\n\u00a3500) and checking over budgets for\nevents. Basically, my job is to make\nsure all that all our money is spent\nproperly.\nI am the chair of the Bookstore\nand Refectory Services committees,\nwhich oversee the management of\nthe bar, snack bar and bookstore.\nOne of the things I 've been doing\nthis year is having regular meetings\nwith the staff managers of these\noutlets, so I should know about all\nthat's going on with them.\nTalking to people is a pretty\nwide-ranging description of the rest\nof what I do - this includes taking\nup accommodation matters with\ncollege, discussing financial problems with clubs, sitting on a number\nof college committees (including\nGoverning Body) and working on\nvarious things with the other Union\nofficers and members of staff.\nThere are also a number of other\nthings I do, such as: games &\nvending machines, minibuses,\ntelephones, Union cards, security,\nbuilding projects, having to write\nthings like this, eating and sleeping\n(occasionally), etc, etc, etc.\nIf anyone is interested in the fun\nand groovy (no, really) job of DP\n(F&S) and wants to know more,\nthen pop in and see me in the Union\nOffice for a chat. Basically, the job\nis a good one (most of the time), but\nI'm glad I'm only doing it for one\nyear.\nDeputy President (Clubs & Societies)\nWith elections approaching it makes\nme wonder how many people know\nwhat it is that sabbaticals do. Some\npeople will know what the job of\nDeputy President (Clubs &\nSocieties) entails, but most people\nwill not. The people who do will\nalmost certainly be those involved\nin the Union already. If you are\nthinking of standing, but know very\nlittle about ICU, then don't let this\nfactor put you off.\nSabbaticals are trained for one\nmonth by the person vacating that\npost. This means that the training is\ndone by the person that knows that\njob the best. If you don't know the\ndifference between aCC U and an\nMSC then this is not a problem.\nWhat you do need is determination\nto do a good job, a friendly disposition and a keen interest in\nhelping people. Experience in clubs\nand societies is a good background,\nbut not essential.\nEveryone is involved in some\nactivity and there is a colossal range\nrun by the Union. The Deputy President does not run these activities.\nThe job involves overlooking the\nrunning of these activities and\ngiving advice to the people organising them. Problems will always\nappear and the Deputy President is\nthere to ensure that these are solved.\nThe job also involves day to day\nclubs administration, for example\ninsurance, room bookings, publicity,\nsports and of course Freshers' Fair.\nThe job involves representing\nclubs views to College. This is a chance to play your part in ensuring\nthat important decisions that are\nmade reflect the students views.\nIt is a very full time job, but the\nrewards in terms of job satisfaction\nare potentially immense. If you are\nconsidering standing for this post\nthen feel free to come into the\nUnion Office to find out more.\nFelix Editor & Print Unit Manager\nSo, you want to be Felix Editor?\nWell, you will not only be editing a weekly magazine, you will be the\nmanager of a Print Unit. Don't let\nthis put you off. If you've had no\nexperience in the printing world,\nthat doesn't matter and the same\ngoes for editing; you'll be taught all\nyou need to know and you'll soon\npick it up.\nFelix Editor. The job of editing\nFelix involves not only reading\nthrough and edition what goes into\neach issue, it's defending the concept of editorial freedom. For years,\nthe motto of Felix has been 'Keep\nthe Cat Free'. This not only refers to\nsupplying it free of charge, but also\nkeeping the content editorially free.\nFelix Editors have always fought to\nkeep the right to print what they feel\nis what the students want, rather\nthan what College and the Union\nwant them to print. Even though\nsome of the money to produce Felix\ncomes from College through the\nUnion, what's the use of having a paper which cannot report on the\ngoings-on in its own College?\nPrint Unit Manager. Although\nthe printing of Felix takes priority,\nother print work is taken on to help\nto generate the money to replace the\nequipment (printer, coll at or, binder\nand guillotine). The equipment\nshould therefore be kept in use as\nmuch as possible. Managing the\nPrint Unit means organising the\nprinting schedule in conjunction\nwith the Printer (a permanent\nmember of staff), making sure that\nall the work is completed on time\nand ensuring that the machinery is\nused effectively.\nFeel free to come and have a chat if\nyou want to know more.\nElection Dates\n14 February - Papers up. In the next ten\ncollege days, you can stand for election. Sign up\nto show your intention to run for a sabbatical\npost. You need to be proposed by someone and\nhave twenty people to second you.\n25 February - Papers Down. The nomination\nperiod closes. All full proposed and seconded\ncandidates are now in the running for election.\nThe next two weeks. The candidates campaign\nto win your vote. Hustings are organised so that\nyou can question candidates on anything and to\n'see them in action'.\n14 March - Voting starts. Voting stations all\nover College are in operation, recording your\nvotes.\n15 March - Second and last day of voting. By\nevening, the poll is over, any the votes are\nbegining to be counted. Later the candidates\nknow who are the winners in the '94 elections.\n\n"

    "content": "Clubs and Societies 11\nThe London\nDuck\nSunday saw the end of the qualifying league\nand unfortunately IC just failed to scrape\nthrough to the quarter finals.\nSouthampton, Birmingham and the two\nLondon teams won their quarters and progressed\nto the semi's. Southampton scored a convincing\nvictory over London 2, but London 1 hung in\nthere and shot past Birmingham to secure their\nplace in the final.\nSo yet another London/Southampton final.\nLondon took the first of the three races, but\nSouthampton won the last two to claim this\nyear's London Duck Trophy, several yellow\nplastic ducks and a crate of beer.\nFinal Results\n1st Southampton\n2nd London 1\n=3rd/4 th London 2, Birmingham\nQuarter Finalists: Bristol, Queens Belfast,\nOxford, Southampton ladies\nPlate\n1st Cambridge\n2nd Cardiff\nLeague finalists: Bristol ladies, Imperial,\nBrunei, London ladies,\nCambridge ladies, Durham,\nOxford ladies, Manchester\nCafe Club Go To Wales\nSaturday 22nd January saw the first day of this\nyear's London Duck, a two day sailing event for\nuniversities across the country. The Duck is held\nby the University of London Sailing Club by the\nWelsh Harp Reservoir, near Wembley.\nEighteen teams entered, each one consisting\nof three helms and three crews. It was great to\nsee five ladies teams compete on close terms to\nmost men's teams and beat several of them.\nThe qualifying leagues held on Saturday\nproduced good sailing and some surprises,\nincluding London ladies storming through to\nbeat Southampton, one of the favourites.\nAlso in for a surprise was IC's very own\nMark Riley falling out of a boat. While he was\nyachting around before the start, casually hiked\nout over the gunwales, he performed a backward\nroll that any gymnast would be proud of straight\ninto the drink.\nThe surprises did not include our very own\ncommodore, Ben Deverson missing two starts\nand capsizing in another race. But this did not\nstop us beating Bristol ladies, Cambridge ladies\nand Manchester, though it might have played a part in our 'close' losses against Queen's Belfast, London 1, Oxford, Bristol and Oxford\nladies (who mostly consisted of men).\nOur loss against London was not close, which\nmay be because a 'top' IC sailor James (Flees)\nLees was sailing for London; then again, maybe\nit wasn't! Oxford had to resort to some severe\nrule bending to beat us, but by the time the\nprotests were held, the IC team were too drunk\nto get through the protest room door.\nThe Mountaineering Club's first trip of the new\nterm was to Tremadog in North Wales. After the\nordeal of the president's driving we arrived at\nthe cafe that is conveniently situated below the\ncrags. There are only three other buildings\nnearby, one of which was the barn where we\nwere staying, but it still took us a quarter of an\nhour and a serious degradation of relations with\nthe locals before we knew exactly where we\nwere sleeping.\nSaturday morning saw us up at the unbelievably early time of 10am but life goes by at a different pace in Wales and we still had to wait\nfor the cafe to open. Suitably encouraged by a high cholesterol breakfast, members of the Club\nwere to be seen performing great acts of bravery\nall day, moving gracefully (and otherwise)\nacross the sun drenched rock and back and forth\nto the cafe.\nSeveral demonstrations of advanced air\ntraffic controlling were also observed, as flying\nmembers of the Club were brought to rest by\nropes as opposed to pinnacles of rock and the\nground. To round off the day we went to the pub,\nonly to be confined to the games room, well\naway from any true Welsh-blood locals (and that\nwas before we said what we thought of Welsh\nrugby).\nSunday morning was also blessed with\nsunshine, and temperatures were swiftly into\ndouble figures. The cafe owner was slowly\nlearning the economics of a free market\neconomy and opened earlier allowing an earlier\nstart. (Climbing on an empty stomach is strictly\nfrowned upon.) Some Club members, obviously\nunder w helm ed by the 200ft high cliffs of\nTremadog, left to sample the delights of some\n\"well 'ard\" stuff in the Llanberis slate quarries,\nwhile the rest renewed their struggle with the\nmore immediate rock.\nSunday evening saw ten very tired bodies\ntransported back to London, with a brief interlude at Holly's, the culinary paradise fit to\nconvince any Frenchman that the English know\ntheir stuff about cuisine.\nThe Club has three further trips planned this\nterm and anyone, including complete beginners,\nis welcome to come. See the Club notice board\nin the corridor to the Live-Net studio next to the\nJCR for details.\nRag On Tour\nRag Tour is 'Going South' rather than north this\nyear for financial reasons. If you fancy a trip to\nthe beach combined with a wild weekend away,\nthis is the event for you. Towns include\nCanterbury, Southampton, Portsmouth, Brighton\nand Bournemouth. The minibuses leave early\nafternoon on February 18th and will be\nreturning on Sunday.\nThose of you who were disappointed when\nthe a bse il from the Forum Hotel was cancelled\nshould fret no more. You can now a bse il from\nthe Holiday Inn, Kings Cross on 12th March.\nCalling all sick and depraved students. We\nwill soon be electing next year's Rag Mag\nEditors. If you think you have the right mind for\nthe job then see Jane or Helen in the Rag Office\nas soon as possible.\nThis weekend is the RCS collection at\nCovent Garden for the C CU challenge. We are\ncollecting on Sunday for Turning Point who are\ngiving the top collectors a hamper of condoms.\nWe have a meeting today at 1.10pm in the\nEnts Lounge or come and see us in the Rag\nOffice which is on the second floor of the east\nstaircase in the Union.\nIt can be found in the centre pages of every issue of Felix\n\n"

    "content": "18 Reviews\nAlice in Chains\nJars of Flies/ Sap\n'Sap', recorded a couple of years ago but until\nnow only available on import, is probably Alice\nin Chains' finest moment to date. Lacking the\ndisconsolate anguish of the two albums,\n'Facelift' and 'Dirt', 'Sap' is a chink in the\ncurtains which allows a ray of light into the\ndarkest room. That's not to say that these four\nsongs are particularly cheerful, they're just more\nlaid-back than the album material. Plaintive\nrather than bitter, soothing rather than\noppressive.\n'Jar of Flies' tries to do the same thing as\n'Sap'; again it's heavily acoustic and replaces\nthe twisted, dark approach of 'Dirt' with a mellower one. But, alas, it isn't half as good.\nSinger Layne Stayley is partly to blame, having\nelected to croon the majority of his vocal lines\nas though terminally weary. Maybe he was tired\nwhen this was recorded, but that's no excuse for\npiling bushels over an unparalleled talent. Only\nthe Country and Western number 'Don't Follow' and the jazzy 'Swing On This' save 'Jar\nof Flies' from sounding like a collection of\ntracks rejected from 'Dirt', but then it's too late.\nI blame it on complacency. (7)\nFreddy Cheeseworth\nTerrorvision,\nBaby Chaos\nGarage\nHere come Baby Chaos. Sounding like a mixture of the Spin Doctors, Ned's Atomic\nDustbin and Wonderstuff, seasoned with\nperhaps just a pinch of Mindfunk. I don't think\nthat this band are in immediate danger of being\noriginal but they make a good noise and that's what's important. With their own hint of\ndirection, these Babies could well have\nsomething going for them.\nAs for Terrorvision, well, I think I'm starting\nto like them. Their most apparent feature is that\nthey don't sound like anyone else. Also in their\nfavour are diversity, a dry Northern humour and\nan utter lack of shame when throwing around\nthe sort of pop hook that would make Pete\nWaterman cringe. Tonight we're treated to some\nnew material from the forthcoming album which\nis far better than the older material. This is\nhopefully a sign that it won't be long before the\nBradford foursome have enough material for a full length set with no boring bits at all.

Mill Ill ll ll ll ll ll l Pavement\nCut Your Hair\nFor 199l's 'Slanted and Enchanted', Pavement\ntook pop music and turned it on its head to\nproduce a uniquely charming, if occasionally\nodd, album. This time around they've taken their\nown music and turned it upside down,\nunwittingly arriving at Classic Pop. But there's still something special about the melody and the\napathetic voice of Steven Malkmus which melts\nthe heart. So, from the opening squeals, through\nthe \"Ooh, ooh ooh\" chorus (reminiscent of the\nolder 'In The Mouth A Desert') to the fuzzed-out guitar break, a mellow, melodic time is had\nby all. This is not Pavement at their best and\nsome will doubtless complain that it sounds\nmore commercial than their previous output, but\nit's as good as anything else so far this year and\nthere's no reason not to love it.\nGuy\nOh dearly beloved, we are gathered here this\ncrisp Friday morning to partake of the most\njoyous occasion there can be between the\nhuman cognitive system and the aural world of\nexternal stimuli. I jest not in jest fulness, for\nthere is another Gigolo Aunts single released.\nIt is Vik's turn to ya wp, this time barbaric ally in\nfavour of 'Where I Find My Heaven\". \"Imagine\na toon from the hyperactive, illegitimate child of\nthe Posies, Teenage Fanclub and Gin Blossoms;\njan gly heavy guitars and a melody that bites like\na pitbull packaged into something altogether\nAmerican. One of those rare breeds, a great\nsingle.\" I myself can only nod wisely in\nagreement and to show how much we love this\nband, here's a picture - just in case you still\ndon't get it.\nBut we must press onwards and upwards to\nthe heights of Intastella's 'Point Hope'. \"I saw\nthem once in Manchester,\" reminiscences a tearful Glyph. \"Stella was out at the front\npumping her hips and trying to grapple a microphone. She couldn't remember any of the\nwords and after one or two songs the guitar\nplayer fell off the side of the stage...I 'll give this\nthe thumbs up for old times' sake and for the\ntime in the Milk Bar when I saw Stella and she\nwaved at me. All right I fancy her...\" OK, so he\ndid also tack onto the end of his fantasy \"...but\nthe mixes are quite good.\"\nOur arrival on planet Red Kross is about two\nweeks too late. So. The single was 'Visionary'\nand appropriately Guy gets the job: \"Red Kross\nshould be seen and not heard. On record you\ncan't see the sequin ned lycra body suits and the\nmetal-parody posturing, so you're just left with\nthis, a thinly disguised Bon Jovi song. It's inoffensive...go and see them live.\"\nQuickly we dash onto Lisa Germane, label\nmate of the most illustrious Kristin Hersh. Lisa's delicately named single is 'Inconsiderate Bitch'.\n\" A heady, eclectic brew of breathy vocals and\noddball lyrics refuses to fit the round holes of\nour expectations\" pipes up a fully awake Joe.\nThe violent persuasions of my colleagues\ninform me that the Boo Radley's album 'Giant\nSteps' is a matchless piece of art. Their new\nsingle, 'Barney(...and me)', despite being\ncunningly parenthesis ed, reminds me more of a mix 'twix the summer of love and Rainbow, that\nwell-loved children's programme. The twirl y flute could be played by Bungle himself and the\nhappy smile throughout is like that blazoned\nacross Geoffrey's woolly sweaters.\nI remain, sadly, Tintin.\n\"...the kind of mistakes nobody can trace...?'\n\n"

    "content": "16 Reviews\nMoving Mars\nby Greg Bear\nWhat an arrogant title! And I can assure you that\n'moving' is not an emotional qualifier. Yet, if\nyou are a loyal follower of Greg Bear, even such\na feat is conceivably commonplace.\nBy employing Mars as a nebulous and young\nproto-Republic and Earth as the supposedly\nmature big-sibling, Bear examines a whole\nspectrum of value systems (some of which are\nquite visible in some nations at the time of\nwriting) and the socio-political sparks that result\nfrom a(s) word fight between the two. Whilst\nEarth purports to be socially and technologically\nmature, it feels threatened when independent\nMars is on the verge of an Earth-shattering (pun\nintended) scientific breakthrough. But the novel\nis so complex that it encapsulates everything\nfrom nanotechnology to Martian weather, from\nleadership to love. Bear contends that we shall\nnever break free of our primal selves - our\nprimitive instinct to survive that so often contradicts our logical reasoning. And sometimes, to\nour horror, in hindsight, it actually assumes the\ndriver's seat.\nIf you have had visions of the ultimate in\ndemocracy (a truly plebiscite society quite\nconceivable with the direction and growth of\ntoday's communication-and-computer-networks)\nthis book will reveal some very special side\neffects. If you are on the verge of tapping the\nBell Continuum, this novel will tell you of some\nof the impacts that wielding the technological\nSword of Damocles will have on supposedly\nmature cultures. If you are thinking of patenting\nthe first neural-enhancement module, this book\nexplores further (from Queen Of Angels) the\nloss of creativity (humanity?) that may result\nfrom the consummation of marriage between the\nnatural and artificial mind.\nI must admit to having been slightly disappointed in the 'Far out!' department initially.\nMost of the devices (as in literary) and drama (as\nin scientific) that he uses in Moving Mars have\nbeen toyed with in his past opuses. (If you have\nnot read the likes of Queen Of Angels, Anvil Of\nStars and Forge Of God, especially the former\ntwo, ignore this paragraph.) At one stage I was\nconvinced that he had all but run out of ideas.\nBut I quickly realised that I was approaching\nthe novel from the wrong parabola. I had placed,\nquite un justifiably, the above expectations\nwithout considering Bear's own growth as a writer and this book is immensely satisfying in\nthe chaotic complexity of the socio-political\nterrain that it explores.\nI heartily recommend Moving Mars. The\nnovel is self-contained but I suggest that you\nread his last few novels as well in order to glean\na better understanding of the sort of technology\nhe alludes to. Do wait for the normal-format\npaperback, unless you are willing to spend \u00a39.99\nand not fret about lugging around something as\nunwieldy as a neurobiology text-book.\nOr, you could borrow it off me.\nHermes Trismegistus\nPublished by: Legend\nPrice: \u00a39.99 (Large Format Paperback)\nQuarantine\nby Greg Egan\nIn 2034 the stars went out. The planet Earth has\nbeen cut off and quarantined by the rest of the\ngalaxy.\nIn the thirty three years since 'The Bubble'\nformed, the fear of this unknown has produced\nmany religious cults and terrorist groups.\nNick is a private detective, who is asked to\nfind a woman, Laura Andrews, who has managed to escape from a secure clinic. Using a range of neurological implants that have\naugmented his normal senses and physical\nreactions and keep him plugged into the worldwide communications net, he sets off in pursuit.\nHowever, very little goes to plan once he locates\nLaura and he finds himself caught up in some\nmind-bending experiments.\nThe book starts off as a Marlowesque (!) plot\nwith characters transferred to the 21st century. It\ndevelops from there to a clever story with nice\nsensible technology; but halfway through the\nbook, the plot just loses direction. Although it\npicks up towards the end, it never regains the\nmomentum that it developed at the start.\nBlodwin\nPublished by: Legend\nPrice: \u00a34.99\nNight Sisters\nby John Pritchard\nThe book's cover is all wrong: the title should\nhave been 'The Clinicians', with the threat\n' You' ll never feel safe in hospital again'\nreplaced by 'You never did feel safe in hospital,\ndid you?'.\n\"They started out as doctors...so where did it\nall go wrong?\" In their gruesome quest for\ndeath-defying life, the Order of Clinical Judges\ncarry out live biopsies and more - all in the\nname of knowledge that is necessary to stay\nalive for more than one lifespan - they obviously\ndon't believe in reincarnation. The Clinicians\nare happy to hack away at live 'expendables'.\nTheir need for operating equipment and rubber\ngloves (the irony lies in their not having washed\nthemselves in at least five centuries), not to\nmention a supply of live patients (!), makes\nthem take over disused floors in a hospital. This\nmay carry a warning to St Bart's Hospital and\nothers who have suffered Tory cutbacks on\nexpenditure. That ex-outpatient's clinic or\nex-cancer treatment unit could be the perfect\narrangement for the Clinicians to carry out their\nexperiments on human pain thresholds.\nConclusions: Medics playing God - old hat,\nnew brim.

Anagrams\nEverybody's favourite clue is the anagram.\nThere are two ways of spotting an anagram.\nFirstly, you can count the letters of an unusual\nset of words (they might contain an apos-trophe). Secondly, there should be an anagram-indicator. Here's an anagram clue:\nHear cat scramble up pipe (7)\nThis is an anagram of 'Hear cat'\nindicated by the words 'scramble up'.\nand is\nSCRIBBLE PAD\nH \u00a3\nARC AT There are hundreds of anagram-indicators -they can imply disorder, movement, rewriting,\nmixing or almost anything remotely suggesting\nabnormality. There are obviously too many to\nlist here so just dive into these simple\nexamples:\n1. Tim is so upset about the separation (7)\n2. Get richer while rate is slashed (9)\n3. Hawaiian dances at a lush resort (5)\n4. Lead astray in the valley (4)\n5. So I ban absurd little trees (6)\n6. Alter UN resolution for the car manufacturer\n(7)\n[See also clues 7 & 28 across and 5 & 16 down\nabove.]\nTwo anagram-indicators to be wary of are\n'about' and 'out'. They can be cunningly\ndisguised in the clue and what's more they can\nalso imply other cryptic operations.\nLesson 3. Splitting Words\nDividing a word up into two or more parts is a very common trait of cryptic clues.\nOccasionally a word is constructed from two\nconsecutive words. Take ANTELOPE: Insect to run away with a gazelle (8)\nANT+ ELOPE = ANTELOPE\nor CATACOMB: \u2022 Felix leads a search for buried cemetery (8)\nCAT + A+ COMB = CATACOMB Felix obviously implies CAT. Don't take too\nmuch notice of the word 'leads': here it just\nmeans that the word CAT comes first and is put\nin to make the clue read better. Notice how 'a search' suggests a noun but it is actually the\nword A followed by the verb COMB. The\nfollowing examples have the straightforward\ndefinition in italics.\n7. Steer clear of a hole (5)\n8. Gaunt monarch is meditating (8)\n9. Find a record again (8)\n10. Knave pockets the winnings (8)\n11. Pleases happy hideaways (8)\n12. Fish come in like Jesus (9)\n[Try 13 across above.]\nPerhaps equally common is the answer\nconsisting of a word inside a word.\nReconsidering the answer to clue 12,\nCARPENTER is also the word PEN inside\nCARTER: Former president holds pen for woodcutter (9)\nLook out for phrases like 'put into', 'gets\ninside', 'goes round' or 'put about' etc:\n13. Friend goes round and gets authority (7)\n14. Raced around peak and then finished (6)\n15.

    "content": "ft. Clubs and Societies\nDo We Have The Mentality Of Vegetables?\nThe idea that most students at Imperial College\nleave with a great degree but unfortunately little\nby way of education is a recurrent, albeit occasional, topic of discussion; if you don't believe\nme, check out the letters' page a fortnight ago.\nRather than chastise those of you who spend\nyour three or four years here with the mentality\nof a vegetable, the purpose of this article is to\nencourage you to develop and broaden your\nhorizons and interests.\nThis coming week, S CC( Social Clubs\nCommittee), the fragment of the Union which\ncontains religious, political and miscellaneous\nsocieties, presents (for want of a better name)\n'Ideological Week'. This, hopefully, will be a week of events aimed at provoking political and\nreligious discussion between all the students, not\njust those who've bothered to join such societies\nbecause of their convictions.\nEducation, from my subjective viewpoint, is\nabout opportunity; this opportunity, to gain\nknowledge and find out about both the external\nworld and oneself, is one which students can\nbenefit from probably more than most sectors of\nthe population. Unfortunately it's also one which\na large number choose to ignore. Even if we\nwere to divide ideology into the two main categories of religious belief and politics (excepting\nof course ideologies such as Islam, which offer\nan entire creed), this ignorance would be illustrated by the sheer numbers of people who\nhaven't really thought about religion (i.e. who\ndon't even claim to be agnostic) and who can't be bothered to vote in the various elections that\nget held around college, let alone those which\ndecide the government of the country.\nWithout wishing to appear to agree with the\n'back to basics' campaign being bandied about\nby the current government (crap, in my humble\nopinion) I'd suggest that this indifference is a reflection of the prevalent lack of not morality,\nbut any consideration of morality. The blame for\nthis, the shunning of personal responsibility, lies\nwith all of us as individuals, rather than the\nabstract scapegoat of 'society as a whole'.\nInstead of exploring the relationship between\nbehavioural and societal changes, however, a task which I personally am incapable of, I'd like\nto point out just some of the wide range of issues\nwhich have to be resolved if people are to make\nwhat is often called progress.\nIt ought to be noted first that such issues\noften involve both the religious and political\nspectra; examples of this include blasphemy,\ncensorship and homophobia, all of which have\nbeen in the news in quite a major way over the\nlast couple of years. The issues of blasphemy\nand censorship, which will be highlighted by\nthis week's showing of The Last Temptation of\nChrist, themselves ignite questions about religious tolerance and cultural prejudice.\nEnglish society is often capable of extreme\nnarrow-mindedness, hypocrisy and prejudice.\nThis isn't some desperate, blind attack and I am\nnot claiming that English culture is worse than\nany others; it's merely an observation (how\nmany of you who object have any genuine experience of an alternative culture?). Global cultural\ndiversity and multiculturalism is perhaps one of\nour greatest assets in trying to understand answers\nto religious and political questions. Our perceptions of problems such as political (and sometimes religious) bias in the media, sexual\ndiscrimination and the relationship between the\nthird and first world can all benefit if contrasted\nwith arguments about the same topics around the\nworld. It's worth bearing this in mind when\ntrying to make sense of the following arguments.\nOn the subject of religious tolerance (and\nacceptance), to what extent does the invocation\nBrazilian Party Night\nLast year Third World First staged a Brazilian\nnight to raise money for the Brazilian Rubber\nTappers (who fight to preserve Brazilian Rainforests). If you came last year I need only say\nthat due to popular demand its happening again\non the Thursday 10th February in the Union. For\nthose who didn't come it's a great night. We\nhave the Latin-Salsa band ViraMundo playing\n(starting at about 8.30pm) along with a Latin\ndisco and cheap Latin beers and it's only \u00a33.\nOn Wednesday 9th February, there will be a talk on Fair Trade in Biology Room W2 and in\nthe evening there will be a debate on Third\nWorld development. There will be stalls selling\nfairly traded goods all week in the JCR\nThe profits made from the party will go to a project supporting the Brazilian Rubber\nTappers' Union, jointly funded by Oxfam and\nThird World First.\nIn Brazil, which is one of the most indebted\ncountries in the world, vast areas of the rainforests are being destroyed to repay the co un try's debts to western and international banks.\nThe Rubbers Tappers are fighting to stop this\ndestruction and exploitation, they were the first\ngroup to alert the international media to the\nplight of Brazil's Rainforests and their leader\nChico Mendes was assassinated for his\ncampaign work against the vested interests of\nthe major logging and 'development' companies.\nThe Rubber Tappers have fought to establish\n'ex tractive reserves' to develop the forests in\nways that protect the environment and provide a livelihood for themselves and their families -of blasphemy prevent the questioning of re li gion, as opposed to its ridicule, and how legit i mate, assuming personal morality to be independent of religion, is this? My own sentiments are\nthat any form of religious questioning ought to\nbe allowable as long as prejudice, hatred or\nviolence aren't promoted in any way. If these\ncriteria are satisfied then ridicule ought to be\npermissible as well in the name of freedom of\nspeech. Is y mpa this e with those who disagree,\nthough, since it's very difficult to differentiate\nbetween ridicule and the promotion of prejudice.\nConventions and standards need to be questioned continually for us to be assured of their\nusefulness. When is the last time anyone thought\nto consider inherent biases in the media? One\nexample was the publishing by 'The Observer'\non the first Sunday of the Gulf War of a photo of\nthe burnt corpse of an Iraqi soldier trying to\nclimb out of a tank destroyed by American\nbombers. One of the effects was to highlight the\nsycophantic militarism which pervaded other\npapers. Politics is often seen as a set of abstract,\nsemi-philosophical arguments; it isn't. It may be\nregarded as the choice of criteria, which must be\nused to determine the best method of govern-ment. The solutions to particular issues aren't difficult; the choice of the criteria used to evaluate them, however, is. In this case, any issue\nwhich affects people is a political one.\nThis article has investigated the scope and\nimportance of a few aspects of personal\nideology. Hopefully, it has stimulated you into\nthinking about your own beliefs a little more. If\nyou're interested in other people's beliefs, or if\nyou'd like to share your own then come to some\nof the events in 'Ideological Week'. Even if you\ndon't benefit from someone else's opinion, then\nthey at least can benefit from yours.\nJayanta K Fouzder\nthey take nothing from the forest that cannot be\nregenerated.\nMoney raised for the project will help to:\n1. Support Rubber Tappers in their campaign to\nprotect the Rainforests and create 'ex tractive reserves'.\n2. Provide e duct ion in literacy and numeracy.\n3. Set up schools for children in the community.\n4. Organise training in running co-operatives.\nThe Rubber Tappers' campaign to protect the\nenvironment is one that affects us all. If you\nwant more information on the project there will\nbe a short speech from a Brazilian development\nworker before the band starts, there will also be\na display in the UD H on the night of the 10th or\nif you can't make it on the 10th you can contact\neither Third World First or Oxfam.\nIdeological Week is organised by the Social Clubs Committee\n\n"

    "content": "20 Reviews\nOne Sunday afternoon I sat practising S.D.( selective deafness) in the presence of my noisy\nfamily of four other members. Perching\nperilously on the edge of my ex-bed (recently\ntaken over by my younger female sibling), I travelled through dimensions unknown to a space where Bram Stoker's Dracula mercilessly\nsnatched and bagged infants from their mother's bosoms. While the mother sent heart-rending\ncries of grief echoing through the otherwise still\nnight air of Transylvania, the Count rubbed his\nclaws together in anticipation of his twilight\nfeast of such fresh, young blood. No longer able\nto bear the annoying wails of the bereft mother\ncasting herself on his garden path, pleading for\nan act of mercy from this progeny of men and\ndevil, this fifth cousin three times removed to\nAtilla the Hun, Count Dracula, lets loose his\nstarving wolf-pack upon the grieving mother.\nWithin the passage of a few femtosecond s, the\nnight becomes silent once more, but for the\nhowling of the half-fed wolf-pack. Suddenly my\nwhole body was displaced to the left by a few\ncentimetres as a ripple of fear raced through me.\nI held the book at arm's length as lucid\nvisions of the read events replayed themselves in\nmy mind's eye. I tried to indulge in the feeling\nof making it last a few more seconds during\nwhich time all was shattered by the shrill ringing\nof the telephone. My mother informed me that I was in demand. I emitted a sigh worth ten litres\nof air and reluctantly went to answer. Just\nbetween you, me and this piece of paper, I was\nquite relieved for the excuse to take a break from\nCount Dracula and his eccentric life-style.\nThere's only so much excitement one can take in\neach lifetime.\nAmanda had called from her brother's place.\nShe was baby-sitting Milton, her two-year-old\nnephew and, in the process of doing, so had\nbecome restless. So, to relieve her boredom and\nto repay me some mild grief I'd caused her in\nhigh school, she rang my number. Mission\naccomplished. First she asked me a few pointless\nquestions to which I replied with non-committal\ngrunts. Then she harassed me about not replying\nto any of the many letters she had written to me,\nnot forgetting to mention that I hardly ever rang\nher during term-time. I responded with some\nhalf-hearted exam revision (what's that?) excuse\nand something else equally pathetic.\nTrivial chit-chat. As friends in a position to\nrun up someone else's phone bill are included to\ndo, Amanda then revealed to me more trivial\ninformation. As she was talking to me, her\nbrother's fax machine had just given birth to a long message from one of his pestering friends.\nBefore I could open my mouth again I heard the\nfax being read out to me and it went something\nlike this:\n\" A small bird was flying south for the\nwinter when he was driven off course by\nstrong gales. He ended up in a snowdrift in\nGreenland. When it was all over, the poor\nbird lay on the snow-covered ground,\nfrozen to the bones. A wolf came out to\nhunt for food and, surveying the aftermath\nof the snowdrift, he noticed a frozen feathered creature. The wolf approached the\nthing and saw it looking pathetically help-less. So, although he was hungry, the wolf\nrefrained from devouring the bird. Instead,\nhe picked up the half-dead bird and dropped\nit in a pile of fresh, steaming manure.\nThe warmth of the manure soon gave the\nbird use of his limbs again and upon\nopening his eyes, found himself in deep\nmanure. Eager to improve his condition, the\nbird waited for any passer-by to chance\nupon him. Presently along came an animal\nwho, responding to the bird's pleas,\ndropped him on the ground then walked\naway. The little bird found it impossible to\nstand up on the icy ground so like any\namateur in an ice-rink his legs splayed\ntreacherously and he fell. The impact of the\nfall was too much for the hungry, tired bird\nwho had already remained frozen for some\ntime. The fall caused his death.\nMorals of the story are two-fold:\nSomeone who drops you in shit is not\nnecessarily your enemy, and Someone who\ngets you out of shit is not necessarily your\nfriend.\"\nWhen she'd finished, I commended the morals\nand also the style of the story. After further\nexchanges of trivia and meaningless promises to\nkeep in touch with each other we eventually\nended our long association via telecommunications. Later that night, while I lay in bed unable to\nsleep a wink (though it was way past two\no 'clock in the morning) I reflected upon our\nseemingly profane telephone conversation.\nPerhaps Amanda had been hinting at the state of\nour friendship - both past and present. We've\nboth managed to drop each other in shit quite a few times since our first acquaintance in 1988.\nBut the mystery in it all is that somehow or other\nwe've always managed to get each other out of\nshit as well.\nMaybe it's got something to do with our\ninsane state of mind or perhaps the fact that we\nboth love south-easterly winds and snowdrifts.\nWhatever the reasons, I still couldn't get to\nsleep that night.\nZiegler\nSituations Vacant\nFeatures Journalists\nShort Story Writers\nSalary: \u00a30 per annum (non negotiable)\nPerks: Cranial inflation and life a qui ration In an effort to enlarge the pleasant green corner of this ever expanding empire, we're\ncurrently looking for talented writers (or would-be writers) to produce features and Cat's Tales' without\ndelay!

    "content": "Feature v.i. Put It Away, There Are Ladies Present!\nAre women scared of particle accelerators? Phill Henry investigates...\nImagine a place, in the most expensive area of\nLondon, where all the men are budding doctors\nand scientists and where the women are outnumbered seven to one.\nIs it a misogynistic MENSA convention? Or\nmaybe even a high class gay club? Neither. It is\nImperial College of Science and Technology,\ncirca 1986. Because of this, the College initiated\na program to entice more women into science, a program which has so far been remarkably\nsuccessful. In just seven years this scheme has\nmanaged to raise the percentage of women in the\nCollege from about 12 to 26 per cent.\nThis national program is called Women Into\nScience and Engineering or WISE. It takes sixth\nform girls on a two day tour of the College.\nThese 'WISE women' are housed in student\naccommodation and allowed to sample their first\ntaste of true student life for absolutely no charge.\nMelanie Thody, joint coordinator of the\nscheme, estimates that out of the 550 participants between thirty and forty choose the\nCollege on their UCC A forms. \"It is an\nextremely successful scheme,\" she says. \"It is no\ncoincidence that the number of females in the\nCollege has doubled since the start of WISE.\"\nMelanie believes that the girls find two things\nparticularly interesting: \"Firstly, a novel sense of\nfreedom in being away from home. And secondly, they find that scientists are not the\ndull, grey people they are made out to be.\"\nThis last point is not necessarily accepted by\nKristine Vaaler, ICU's Student Womens'\nOfficer. It is her job to foresee problems that\nmay affect women - not enough street lamps on\ncampus or an absence of rape alarms in isolated\npublic places for instance - and act appropriately. Although she agrees that there is a large\nnumber of dull, boring and sexist men but there\nare many pleasant males as well.\nKristine is concerned that, even though things\nhave improved substantially, there is still a lot of\npatron is ation especially towards women on the\ncampus. However, there continues to be few\ncomplaints made officially. She feels that this is\nbecause the women at Imperial have to be\nprepared before they start at the College. \"They\nknow the male/female ratios before they apply,\"\nshe says. \"Easily intimidated women, I suppose,\nwould not come to IC.\"\nIntimidation by some men cannot be the only\nreason for the poor male/female ratio. Kristine\nsuggests that convention is largely to blame for\nthe lack of female scientists. She believes that\nsociety teaches science and engineering as a masculine discipline. This point is echoed by Dr\nMargaret Goodgame, one of the College Tutors.\n\"Women are not expected to be good at\nscience,\" she says. \"While little girls are given\ndolls, little boys have mecca no sets. They have\nno fear of science.\"\nDr Goodgame, a lecturer in Chemistry, has\nher own theory why the College female population has risen: \"Apart from the WISE project, I think that the introduction of small language\noptions have helped. The number of female\nstudents taking a small language course is huge.\n\"One year,\" she adds with a grin, \"in one of\nthe language options, there were seven females\nto every male! For Imperial, that is incredible.\"\nDr Goodgame was one of the first to realise\nthe potential in enticing women into science by\nmeans of these courses. The Chemistry department currently has a forty per cent female population, a rise from only twenty per cent in just\nthree years since the introduction of the courses.\nDepartments slow to implement this provision\nhave enjoyed no such success. Since the introduction of language options, the proportion of\nwomen in the Electrical Engineering department\nhas risen from the low figure of six per cent.\nAlthough given the opportunity to read\nlanguages at University, Dr Goodgame, unlike\nmost girls of her generation, chose the sciences.\n\"I always liked science but I loved languages.\nMy headmistress kept sending me on science\ncourses telling me that they would make me\nprefer science. They didn't. However, in my\nday, you had to be eighteen before you applied\nto Oxford University, so I spent my spare year\nappeasing her and learning science. I loved it so\nmuch that I chose to do Chemistry at Oxford\ninstead of a language.\"\nShe personally felt that the extent of sexism\nat this College was not very worrying. \"Most of\nthe sexism is in the form of trivial remarks such\nas: 'Oh, you are the woman so make the tea.' I do not think that this is very serious. After all, if\ngirls don't experience sexism now, then they\nwill be even more intimidated when they leave\nand get a job in the big, bad world.\"\nShe has rarely experienced any sexism\nagainst herself during her time as a lecturer. \"My\ncolleagues are very nice. Only once did I feel\nthat I was being asked to do a trivial job because\nof my sex. I told the person: 'No, you do it.' It\nnever happened again.\"\nHer undergraduate years at Oxford were not\nso easy, however. \"In laboratory, the ten per cent\nwho were girls were separated from the boys. I didn't mind. That was the system and I accepted\nit without thinking. Today, thank God, women\ndon't have to put up with that kind of treatment.\"\nDespite the attack on sexism by college\nauthorities, Imperial has still got far to go to\nredress the male/female imbalance. The\npercentage of women is rising by only one\npercent a year and shows signs of slowing down.\nMaybe, despite all the valiant attempts by the\nCollege, society must first change its attitudes to\nwomen in science before Imperial can boast that\nhalf of its students are female.\nThe second installment of restaurant reviews are on page 15\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews 15\nArt Of The Ancient World\nGeorge Ortiz is one of those great rarities, the\ncollector of antiquities. Once upon a time it was\ncommon for the rich and famous to gather\nhoards of valuable and unique object. In the\nmodern days of regulations and bureaucracy it is\nvirtually impossible for one person to gather\ntogether such objects. Ortiz is one of the few\nwho has managed to overcome such difficulties,\nand over the past 45 years he has acquired an\nincomparable collection of objects from all over\nthe w World. A selection of these rare carvings,\nworks of art and obscure devices are on show for\nthe next two months in the Royal Academy.\nThe works on show date as far back as\n3000BC, and represent the artistry and skills of\nmany of the world's great ancient civilisations:\nMesopotamia, Egypt, the Middle East and also\nfrom Africa and the Pacific islands. The majority\nof the collection, however, heralds from Ancient\nGreece. These artifacts give an intriguing insight\ninto the life and the beliefs of the people who\ncreated them. A whole collection of opulent\nNeolithic fertility goddesses are gathered\ntogether in one display, dating from around\n2500BC. Later works from Greece include small\ncarved warriors, maidens, hunters and a splendid\nbronze figure of Alexander the Great.\nFrom Ancient Egypt come tiny sculptures of\nanimals, sculptures of figures and an outstanding\nbust of Pharaoh Amenenhat III. From the Roman\nage come many statues and busts, along with\nA middle Bronze Age gold armlet\nornate metal plates and drinking horns. An ancient Byzantine metal book cover shows the\nbeauty of early Christian art. From Africa, the\nPacific and South America come a whole collection of religious objects, carvings and even a wooden stool!\nWhen shown together in this manner, the\ncollection is very impressive - not least because\nof the craftsmanship that has gone into the\nobjects themselves, but also because of the way\nin which they have been displayed. Each room\nin the Royal Academy has been arranged with\nminimal simplicity, with clear but unobtrusive\nlight highlighting each display cabinet (the\narrangements were designed by the collector\nhimself). Many of the objects are tiny and the\narrangements really help the viewer to focus on\neach object in turn, none of them appearing\ncrowded or overshadowed by the other items\nnearby.\nThe George Ortiz collection really is superb,\nbut there is one major drawback - the Royal\nAcademy. Such a collection should be within a museum and not locked away in a gallery with a vastly over-inflated entry fee (\u00a34.50 or \u00a33 for\nstudents). In such a place the objects seem\nisolated from their origins and become merely\ndecorative, whereas in somewhere like the\nBritish Museum they could be placed in their\nproper context with other objects from the same\ntimes and places.\nSo, on the whole, I would recommend that\nfor anyone who wanted to see works of great\nartistry and historical interest, they should make\ntheir way to the V&A or the British Museum\nand not the R.A. after all, the museums are\nfree(ish) as well.\nMA\nThe George Ortiz Collection, Royal Academy,\nBurlington House, Piccadilly W1V. 071 439\n7438. Tube: Picadilly. Until 6th April.\nEat, Drink and Be Merry . . .\nTexas Lone Star\nTex-Mex food has been steadily gaining in\npopularity, but the style of food being what it is,\nthere is scant variety from menu to menu. This\ndrawback equally applies to the restaurants - all\nTex-Mex joints aim to give the feel of being in\nthe Wild West. Texas Lone Star is no different,\nthere is the bar, wooden tables, cowboy objects\non the wall and lots of meaty dishes.\nMoving on to the food, your first obstacle is\nthe menu. It is a very entertaining piece of\nartwork but it is easy to miss out on some of the\ndishes offered. The portions are large, so only\neat a starter if you are really hungry.\nAssuming you can find what's on offer, the\nTexas Pup frankfurters (\u00a33.65) are unusual and\nthe Nachos (\u00a33.85 or \u00a34.95) are good to share. If\nthere is a big group the selection of starters with\ndips (\u00a319.80) is good value.\nThe main course holds no surprises, a wide\nrange of burgers (\u00a35), some good ribs (\u00a36), and\nthe normal Mexican selection of enchiladas,\nburritos and chi mi chang as( \u00a36). All this is rather\nmeaty, but veggies don't worry! There is a vegetarian Mexican selection, small but pleasantly\nfilling, all costing roughly \u00a35 each. With all\ndishes a salad or fries is given.\nAlong with these main dishes there are some\ngood side orders to complement your main dish.\nI don't think you need one but they are good\nvalue for what you get, with all of them costing\nless than \u00a32.\nNow, the dessert! All very American, all very\nrich and all very tasty! I loved the Pecan Pie, but\nI was told that the Apple Pie is a must if you like\nthat kind of thing (which I don't). Desserts come\nin at less than \u00a33.\nTLS is a fun place to go, you can be loud and\nwatch the cartoons and the service is pretty\namiable and fast. There is a queue on Fridays\nand Saturdays and you should book for parties.\nOn the weekends there is a nice atmosphere at\nlunch, with kids running around, getting tangled\nup in the legs of the waiters!\nA filling meal at TLS will cost quite a bit less\nthan \u00a310, but a full three course job equals \u00a315.\nWith the cartoons coming to the rescue I award TLS a7/10. Nainish Bapna\n154 Gloucester Road, SW7 Tel: 071 370 5625\nStockpot\nThere are several branches of Stockpot around\nLondon and they all follow the same basic\nformula - quick, simple and cheap food. Decor,\nis is minimalist and the service is reasonable.\nThe menu changes daily, I guess it depends\non whatever is cheap at Sainsbury's. The food at\nStockpot is mostly just re-heated/cooked frozen\nfood. You may well ask why go there? I can\nonly offer the excuse that you feel too lazy to\ncook.\nYou can quite happily have a3 course meal\nhere, with delicacies like chilled melon or prawn\ncocktail to start you off.\nThe main course always has a fair amount of\npasta and a couple of steaks, with chicken, fish,\nomelettes and salads thrown in for variety. But,\nthere is a larger vegetarian choice here than\nnormal. The dish prices range from \u00a32 to \u00a35 - to\ncater for all budgets.\nDesserts are eaten just for the sweetness, not\nfor their exquisite ness( after all, Sara Lee makes\nthem) but it's nice to see jelly and ice-cream on\na menu. There are cheese and biscuits if one\nwishes to eat properly!\nWine is offered and when they serve Coke,\nyou get the whole can! Don't hesitate to ask for\ntap water. The hot chocolate is made with all the\nfroth at the top - lovely!\nTable bookings are not required, but at the\nKings Road branch, I am sure there is a 'love\ntable' because I only ever see 'couples' at it!\nThe Stockpot makes no pretensions and is a cheap place to start an evening. Remember, the\nfood is purely functional. Service is pretty good\nand fast. A heavy meal comes to \u00a36, but \u00a34 is\ncommon. This is about as cheap as you can get\nwith waiter service. Stockpot gets a6/10.

    "content": "4 Feature\nThe Trouble with Research Students...\n...isn't just their tendency to have cool dreads and possess an encyclop a edi knowledge of late eighties Indie music. In fact, says Don Adlington in his\nconcluding welfare article, they can experience difficulties 'peculiar to them'.\nWhen I first came to work at\nImperial I naively assumed that I would not be seeing very many PhD\nstudents. I was wrong. I have talked\nto hundreds of them over the last\ntwenty years and continue to do so.\nI quickly learned that besides the\nnormal life hazards to which all\nstudents are exposed, research\nstudents can experience difficulties\nwhich are more or less peculiar to\nthem. They are probably best\ndefined by simply listing those\nwhich arise most frequently in\npractice.\nMisunderstandings (and occasionally overt conflict) between\nresearch student and supervisor are\na potent source of anxiety and\ndistress - it is the s alien ce of this\nrelationship more than any other\nfactor perhaps, which most sharply\ndistinguishes the day to day life of\nthe research student from all other\nstudents. Where it works well - and\nI have no doubt that in the great\nmajority of cases it does - this\nrelationship can be stimulating and\nimmensely productive, but conversely if serious tensions arise\nthings can be become very difficult.\nThe essential 'unbounded ness' of research both in the ultimate\nscientific/philosophical sense, and\nin the more mundane \"how do I structure my working day?\". Sense\nseems to me to be the other fundamental change\nwhich the research student has to accept and\ncope with. The need for pragmatism in putting a boundary on a research project is sometimes in\ntension with some sort of ideal in a student's mind and this may throw up serious difficulties\nat the writing-up stage. The slightly perfectionist\nquality in some students' make-up, which had\nserved them well on taught courses, can actually\nbe something of a burden at research level,\nwhere the capacity to compromise is sometimes\nimportant.\nA capacity for tolerating the mundane is not\nformally recognised as a required qualification\nfor PhD work, though I believe that it is in fact\nso. Virtually all research students have very\ngood academic records, and moving on to a PhD\nprogramme is the culmination of long held\nhopes and ambitions. There is (and there should\nbe) a strongly romantic element to it. But the\nearly stages of research can be very unromantic\nand plodding - (chasing up equipment and other\nmaterial resources, literature surveys, the failure\nof initial ideas for research topics to crystal lise) and it is easy to become a little bit disillusioned\nand to begin to question whether one has made\nthe right decision.\nStudents who, during their first degrees,\neither at Imperial College or elsewhere, have\nenjoyed a full social life, sometimes experience\na powerful sense both of physical and social\nisolation when they move into research. This\nvaries according to the relative gregariousness of\nthe individual and also depends strongly on the\nethos of the particular research group in which\nhe or she is working.\nUncertainty about 'normal' working hours\nand vagueness about entitlement to leave give\nrise to bad feeling from time to time. Most\nresearch students simply fit into an existing\npattern that precludes any other social or\nrecreational activities.\nPhD students sometimes feel that despite the\nname they are not really students at all and, for\nreasons which from their point of view may or\nmay not be valid, they effectively exclude\nthemselves from participating in student life\noutside their laboratory or research group.\nAlso research students sometimes\nfeel that supervisors are not always\nsensitive to the time parameters\nwithin which they are operating -parameters usually dictated by rigidly\nrestricted funding. Problems of time\nand money are very acute and clearly\npredictable for some overseas\nstudents in particular, who may have\nsaved up a third of their assured\nfunding following required taught\ncourses, before beginning their\nresearch at all.\nFrom time to time a student\ncomes to recognise that the decision\nto do research, made for impeccable\nmotives, was in fact a mistake. This\nperception may indeed be shared by\nthe supervisor, an agreed decision\nhaving been made the the student\nshould disengage. Despite the fact\nthat this may be acknowledged to be\nthe right thing to do and in the\nstudent's own interests, there is\nsometimes an irrational but very\npowerful stigmatic sense of failure.\nThere are a number of things to\nsay about all this. One of them is that\nmost of the potential sources of\nworry I have discussed briefly here\nhave long been recognised. Some of\nthem are dealt with very clearly in\nthe College's booklet Research\nStudents and Supervisors: Their\nresponsibilities and duties. You should have a copy - if not ask for\none at the Registry. Secondly, all research\nstudents have chosen to do what they are doing,\nand what they are doing should on the whole be\nsatisfying and certainly should not be the source\nof protracted tension and anxiety.\nYou should not underestimate the importance\nof talking to your supervisor properly if you are\nunhappy about your situation and things can\nsometimes be changed very easily once a problem has been identified. Every Department\nin College has a Postgraduate Tutor who has a pastoral responsibility to all the postgraduates in\na department and who can be a key person in\nputting things into a wider context, sometimes\nhelping directly to effect change. You also have\nthe right to consult the two College Tutors - Dr\nMargaret Goodgame in Chemistry and Dr\nGareth Jones in Physics, quite independently.\nYou are also very welcome to talk to me. I am\neasily available and my work is totally\nconfidential. My office is at 15 Princes Gardens,\nExt 3041.\nCalvin's trans mo gri fier becomes a time machine on page 16\n\n"

    "content": "14 Clubs and Societies\nThe Afterglow of Creation Football\nAttending a lecture given by the Science Editor\nof New Scientist seems an appropriate pastime\nfor someone who wants to be a science jour-na list. Marcus Chown was the editor, I the\nwannabe at the MathSoc lecture on Friday 21st January.\nHaving thus enticed me to hear him speak,\nChown stepped up to the microphone in the\ngleaming Clore Lecture Theatre to talk on the\nsubject of this new book Afterglow Of Creation.\nThis Afterglow refers to the microwave radiation which permeates the entire universe and is\nall that remains of the Big Bang. The discovery\nin 1992 of 'ripples' in this background radiation\nby the COBE satellite caused a comparative\ndeluge of media coverage. Stephen Hawking\nproclaimed it \"the discovery of the century\" and\none COBE scientist declared that it was \"like\nseeing the face of God\".\nChown, regarding these claims as extravagant, chose to present a different perspective -not a cold 'scientific view' but a true reflection\nof the story of cosmic ripples beginning from\nEdwin Hubble's first notion of an expanding\nuniverse in the 1920s. By contrasting brilliant\nflashes of inspiration (or was it a gamma ray\nburst er?) with periods when experiments were\npainfully inconclusive, Chown had not only a good storyline but a convincing sub-plot about\nthe way in which science is done.\nAs I bought a copy of his book after the\nlecture, I explained my ulterior motives as a science journalism hopeful. It was worth sitting\nthrough the extra twenty minutes of the lecture -he gave me his phone number.\nRebecca Mileham\nHow I Learned To Stop Worrying\nAs part of SCC Ideological Week, ICSF presents\non Monday in Chem Eng LT1 THX 1138 (6pm start) and Dr Strangelove (Or How I Learned to\nStop Worrying and Love the Bomb) (8pm start).\nTHX 1138 is George Lucas's first film, a bleak and nihilistic exploration of state control\nwhere names are reduced to numbers, individuality is suppressed and love outlawed. This stark\nfilm is a far cry from Lucas's later interstellar\npyrotechnics with the Star Wars trilogy.\nStanley Kubrick's Dr Strangelove is a dark\nwartime comedy in the Catch 22 tradition starring Peter Sellers as lots of people, but most\nmemorably as the eponymous, but not at all\nNazi, Dr Strangelove.\nBoth films are free to all students.\nThere is no ICSF film this week due to the\nSCC screening of The Last Temptation of Christ\n(see article).\nIC 2nds21 Royal Holloway 2nds Last Wednesday the Imperial College 2nd XI played the 'be te noir' of IC football, Royal\nHolloway, with a team whose players could\nspeak eleven different languages, but did not\nhave a regular goalkeeper. It was a game of two\nhalves. The first half was a blend of in harmonious attacking by Holloway and a moderate\namount of possession football by IC.\nAfter the interval, Imperial started to dominate the match with neat passing and the opposition looked certain to succumb. But it's a funny\nold game and it was Holloway who scored first\nwith a controversial goal reminiscent of\nCuellemans against the USSR in 1986.\nUndeterred, IC continued to attack and were\nrewarded with an equalise r by a superb 30 yard\nfree-kick by Abs Said. Issam Morris, playing\nwith an injured arm, not unlike Beckenbauer\nagainst Italy in 1970, scored another quality\ngoal for Imperial a few minutes later, when he\nconfounded the Holloway defence and slotted\nthe ball away with a clinical finish.\nIn the last few minutes of the game, IC\ndefended their lead with a valiant performance\nsimilar to Italy against Brazil in 1982. There\nwere a number of notable incidents. Anthony\n'Cantona' Clerc practised his volleyball skills,\nChris Collison tried to mutilate opponents and\nthere was a superlative performance by\nMubarak Choudhry, who stood in for the\nAWOL Mark Nally. This was the first league\nvictory for the seconds this season, and at the\nend of the day it was two points in the bag.\nIC Radio Programme Schedule DAY\nTIME\nFRI\n4th SAT\n5th SUN\n6th MON\n7th TUE\n8th WED\n9th THUR\n10th89 BREAKFAST\nWITH THE\nPOSSE\nBREAKFAST WITH THE POSSE\n9-10\nMUSIC\nJAM\nMUSIC JAM\n10-11\n11-12\nMUSIC\nJAM\nMATT\nAROUND\nMIDDAY\nMUSIC JAM\n12-1 THAT\nFRIDAY\nFEELING\nMATT\nAROUND\nMIDDAY\nDAN THE\nMAN'S LUNCHBOX\n1-2\nTHAT\nFRIDAY\nFEELING\nROBIN\nGRIFFITHS\nDAN THE\nMAN'S LUNCHBOX\n2-3\nROBIN\nGRIFFITHS\nMUSIC\nJAM\nWED'DAY\nWEEK\nMUSIC\nJAM\n3-4\nTOP\n40\nALBUM\nCHART\nWITH\nTHE\nLOFT\nMUSIC\nJAM\nAL'S GROOVE\nSHOW\nMUSIC\nJAM\n4-5\nTOP\n40\nALBUM\nCHART\nWITH\nTHE\nLOFT\nUK\nTOP\n40\nMUSIC\nJAM\nAL'S GROOVE\nSHOW\nMUSIC\nJAM\n5-6\nTOP\n40\nALBUM\nCHART\nWITH\nTHE\nLOFT\nUK\nTOP\n40\nBRYAN'S SHOW\n6-7\nKICK UP\nTHE ARTE\nTOP\n40\nALBUM\nCHART\nWITH\nTHE\nLOFT\nUK\nTOP\n40 MONDAY\nMELTDOWN\nBRYAN'S SHOW\nRICHARD\nSAW'S SHOW\n7-8\nANDY'S SHOW\nMISSION\nIMPOSSIBLE\nRICHARD\nSAW'S SHOW\n8-9\nDOM&\nTHE FAT\nBLOKE\nPOSSE\nPATRICK\nWOOD GOES\nCLASSICAL\nNEWS\n9-10\nS&M( ITS\nEITAROH AJP\nDOM&\nTHE FAT\nBLOKE\nPOSSE\nBACK TO\nBASICS\nPIERS TALKS\nHAMSTER\n10-11\nORGASMIC) \u2014 I And behold!

Instead of violence and\nItalian-American machismo in modern America,\nhe brings us a far from contemporary tale of\nrepressed love, passion and sacrifice.\nFortunately it works; the depiction of the idle\nrich in 1870s New York, a strictly formal world\nconcerned largely with social standing, gossip\nand etiquette, is rich and memorable.\nNewland Archer (Day-Lewis) is awaiting his\nmarriage to the young, apparently nai've May\nWelland (Ryder) when May's unconventional\ncousin Ellen Olenska (Pfeiffer) returns to New\nYork after many years in Europe. Gossip about\nher disastrous marriage and her scandalous\nbehaviour precedes her and she is soon\nostr aci sed by this insular society.\nIt is apparent that Archer feels restricted by\nhis starch i ly formal existence and sees a kindred\nspirit in Madame Olenska who remains defiant\nin the face of society's intolerance.

It may be a costume drama in the vein of Merchant-Ivory\nbut the brilliant period setting in this beautifully\nshot film is never an obstacle to becoming\ntotally involved with the characters.

    "content": "22 Opinion\nEditorial\nIf you are as fortunate as I am to be living in\nSouthside this year (one of the perks of being a sabbatical is that you get a room in hall), you\nwill no doubt be in the process of having a new\ncarpet fitted in your humble abode. 4\nSome lucky people were told that their new\ncarpets would be fitted over Christmas. So, they\ncleared all their stuff away before they went\nhome and expected a new carpet when they got\nback. But no. When they returned, there was a distinct absence of one.\nWhen it came to the turn of staircase 6\n(where I am), a letter went round telling us that a carpet would be fitted at the end of the week. So,\nwe all cleared our stuff away and expected a new carpet to be fitted by the time we got back.\nWrong. Due to 'unforeseen circumstances' they\ncouldn't do it that day.\nI wonder if they'll have got it sorted by the\ntime they get to staircase 8?!\nI get the feeling that people think that\nbecause they are dealing with students, they can\ntreat them differently to the general public. Have\nCollege complained to the contractors that the\nwork hasn't been done, or are they waiting for\nthe students to complain to them? Maybe they\nthink that they can get away with sub-standard\ntreatment because it's just students? Maybe\nthey're right? How many people know how to\nSMALL ADS complain about the service offered by the\nAccommodation Office within College? (I 'll\ngive you a clue - her name's Jill Dove. She's the\nUnion's Accommodation Officer and can pass\non your comments and complaints to the relevant people in College. She can be contacted\nthrough the pigeonholes in the Union Office.)\nIt has been rumoured that the rent in Linstead\nHall next year will be more than the level of the\nstudent grant. This just leaves people the\n'option' of surviving off a student loan. When I came to College, which was the first year after\nthey froze the student grants, I worked out that I wouldn't be able to afford a single room in hall\n(\u00a350 per week) and things certainly haven't changed much since then. I guess College can\nget away with it because students have no other\noption when they come to College than to go\ninto Hall.\nHow many people realise that the rooms in\nSouthside are rented out over the summer as\nconference rooms? This makes even more\nmoney for the College than they already get off\nthe students. Maybe this is why the new carpets\nwere fitted in the rooms? Not because they\nthought the students would appreciate them, but\nbecause it would improve them as conference\nrooms over the summer.\nCredits Photography: Cinema: Puzzles:\nMike Chamberlain Joe McFadden Sphinx\nTypesetter: Simon Govier\nRose Atkins Theatre: Collators Last Week\nFeatures: Rekha Nayak Juliette Decock\nPrinter: Owain Bennallack (Ed) Simon Shaw\nAndy Thompson Phill Henry Opera: Tony Grew\nDon Adlington Patrick Wood Ivan Chan\nBusiness Manager: Ziegler Joe McFadden\nSimon Govier Nainish Bapna Arts: Penguin\nMarcus Alexander Steve Newhouse\nAdvertising Manager: Books: Jon Jordan\nSteve Newhouse Juliette Decock News: Owain Bennallack\nMichael Ingram Tim St Clair\nLayout and Bromides: Music: Lynn Bravey\nKin Wei Lee Jon Jordan\nAll Valentine messages must be in the\nValentine box in the Felix Office by the\nend of today (4th February).\nThe Valentine special issue will be out on\n11th February.\nDramSoc Rehearsal for 'Doctor and the\nDevils' on Wednesday 9th February, 6.30pm in\nthe Union Dining Hall, first floor (central stair-case), Union Building.\nSix Stewards Needed for 22nd February\nbetween 9am and 6pm. \u00a34 per hour.

However,\nas the house lights dimmed on the opening night\nof Richard Strauss's Elektra and the orchestra\nerupted into life, we were abruptly exiled to a chilling ly grey wasteland, the glint of corrugated\nsteel shelters cold and cruel. This uncompromising vision extended to ubiquitous threadbare\ntrenchcoats - Elektra a starkly sexless creature,\nobsessively struggling for vengeance and escape\nfrom her tort u rous grief. The producer, Gotz\nFriedrich, does not quite explore the extreme\nsymbolism of a Harry Kupfer, limiting himself\nto a steady engulfing of the stage in blood at the\nmoment of retribution. Elektra's consequent\n'dance of death' is thus both repellent and pitiful\nin its ecstatic celebration. Her anguish seems to\nhave been cleansed with blood before her death,\nan appropriately unsettling end.\nStrauss's music refuses simply to caress the\nsenses, clawing at something deeper within. Eva\nMarton returned to the title role with a frightening conviction that transcended the purely\nvocal. Not a poetic performance, but one that\ncomplemented the production for its harrowing\nintensity. Of the other performers Marjana\nLipovsek's Klytemnestra was gloriously voiced,\nand it was a delight to encounter the noble\nOrestes of Robert Hale.\nChristian Thielemann's contribution is a little\nmore difficult to assess. Both orchestra and\nconductor seemed to take some time to release\nthemselves from the first-night fetters of self-consciousness. However, it became apparent,\nparticularly in the recognition scene, that\nThielemann is a Straussian of peculiar insight,\nattentive to the myriad orchestral details, while\nalways sustaining tautness and never stinting the\nnaked brutality of much of the score.\nThe performances will surely improve yet\nfurther; strongly recommended.\ni qq y At the Royal Opera House, Bow Street, WC2E.\n(071) 240 1911.

A murder in a coal mine and a determined son heading underground to find out who killed his father.\nYet it's not as easy as that.

    "content": "News\nUGM Under Threat Excellent!\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nThe days of the Union General\nMeeting (UGM) could be num-be red. Due to the poor attendance\nof these meetings, the Union\nPresident, Andrew Wensley, has\nsuggested that a Student Representative Council (SRC) be formed.\nLast week's meeting attracted a around 50 students - less than 1%\nof students in College. Speaking at\nthe U GM on Friday Mr Wensley\nstated: \"This committee would be\nresponsible for the governing of\nImperial College Union (ICU) and\nwould replace UGMs. All members\nof ICU would be able to attend and\nspeak at such meetings, though\nonly members of the Council\nwould be able to vote. We think\nthis will solve the problem of the\nobvious lack of interest in UGMs.\"\nThe proposal has met strong\nopposition from students. Many\nhave expressed a feeling that dropping the U GM will take away the\nstudents' voice in their Union.\nDepartmental Representatives and\nUnion Officers would have to\nundertake a larger responsibility to\nrepresent students views. Felix\nasked Rhian Picton, President of\nthe Royal College of Science\nUnion (RCSU), her views on the\nabolition of the U GM. \"The formation of an SRC could\nbe the right way to get communication going. The UG Ms at the\nmoment are a complete farce, with\nOfficers only going if asked to by\nthe people they're supposed to be\nrepresenting. There is however a danger of it [the SRC] becoming a self-perpetuating body with an\nenclosed circle of people. I can't see how one person could possibly\nrepresent the views of all those\nthey are supposed to.\n\"For example, a Dep Rep\n[Departmental Representative] may\nhave to put forward the views of,\nsay, 600 students. This would\nincrease the workload of the Dep\nReps by a huge amount and there is\nalso no way of knowing if the\nofficer is expressing the views of\ntheir department or their own. I also have to question the proposed\nidea of having Hall Representatives\non the SRC. The principle is good,\nwith the idea of getting more first\nyears involved in the Union, but the\nHall Reps are more likely to be\nsecond or third year re-apps. Again,\nit has to be questioned whether one\nperson could possibly represent all\nthe people in one Hall.\n\"For example, the combined\nHall of Willis Jackson and Holbein\nhas 180 residents. There is no\ncommunal area, so the only way a Hall Rep could hear the views of\neveryone in the hall would be to\nknock on each individual door and\nask. This, of course, would take a huge amount of time and it's doubtful that anyone would actually do that. The current problems\nwith UGMs at the moment are not\nhelped by the bad level of communication. \"Receiving agendas on time\nwould help for a start. There is\noften a lot of confusion at UGMs\nand things aren't explained as they\ngo along. This can't do much to\npromote an interest in Union affairs\nnow can it?\"\nBY MICHAEL INGRAM\nImperial College's Management\nSchool has been rated 'excellent'\nby the Higher Education Funding\nCouncil for England (HEFCE).\nThe School received the top\nrating following an intensive three\nday assessment by a panel from the\nCouncil.

For millions\nof years birds have spread their wings and\nharnessed the forces that nature gives away for\nfree, rising on powerful, invisible elevators in\nthe sky. If you look up any fine day you may see\none of these aviators dancing and circling in\nwhat might seem random motion. You would be\nwrong, for these creatures have perfected the art\nof gliding and their dance allows them to cheat\ngravity for free. We still have much to learn\nfrom them, but man's progress in the past 70\nyears is remarkable. His graceful wings are\nsculpted from carbon fibre, not feathers, but he\nknows the same secrets.\nImperial College Union has the finest college\ngliding club in the country. Students learn to fly\nevery weekend through structured training programmes at Europe's largest gliding centre at\nLasham Airfield, Hampshire. We also provide\ncourses during the holidays for intensive learning and many reach solo standard quickly.\nMany people think gliding is prohibitively\nexpensive but the costs are offset by a40% subsidy by the Union. ICGC itself operates a two seat training glider and two single seat\ngliders which are regularly flown around the\ncountry in competition, for fun and for expeditions to other sites in the UK and Europe\nallowing members to experience the thrill of\nmountain flying and long cross country flights in\nideal weather conditions.\nFor a limited time we are offering free trial\nflights if you decide to join. The annual membership fee is \u00a330, which gives you the opportunity to fly through the summer as well as term\ntime. We have a regular programme of events,\nincluding the annual dinner to be held on Friday\n18th February for only \u00a314.50! If you are interested come to one of our meetings in Aero room\n266 every Thursday at 1pm. See you there!\nAnything\nCould Happen\nIC 1st21 UCL\nA confident Imperial side gathered on Saturday\nready to play top-of-the-league UCL in the\nquarter finals of the Cup. This normally\ndaunting task was diminished by the fact that\nImperial had beaten the other top teams, Kings,\nonly last week. However, with Mike Jarvis out\nthrough injury and Alex de Stefano recovering\nfrom illness, it was always going to be tricky.\nThe match started scrap pil y, with neither\nteam willing to take too many chances. The\nImperial defence of Ian Finnerty, Andy Fentol,\nRob Williams and occasionally Ben Willis made\nsure that UCL had very few chances. Some\nexcellent calls by Chris Evdeman also helped!\nIn the midfield Tellis Botzios was superb, and\nWai Kwok was doing well covering for the\nobviously troubled Richie Dixon. Up front Bill\nKhatib-Ali was doing a fine job, but man of the\nmatch Ike Omambala was in a different class.\nHowever, with such a quality team, the lads\nstill could not score and, with the game looking\nlike a00 draw, IC made an inspired subst it u tion, bringing Dennis Nadarajah on for ten\nminutes before full time. Even he could not\nscore though, so the game went into extra time.\nImperial were by far the strongest side and a quality move involving Stefano and Botzios\nculminated in a fine header from Ike. This goal\nwas soon followed by another superb finish\nfrom Ike, following unselfish play from Dixon.\nUCL did manage to pull one back, but there was\nno doubt who the best team were, as IC sailed\ninto the semi-finals of the cup. Anything can\nhappen from now on!\nBorn On The Fourth Of February\nToday, Sri Lanka celebrates the 46th anniversary\nof independence from its colonial masters. The\nsad irony, however, is that not all of its citizens\n(the Tamil minority) have been truly liberated.\nSri Lanka is an island situated in the southern\nextremity of the Indian subcontinent. The total\npopulation is 17,103,000 consisting of 70%\nSinghalese, 18% Tamils, 7% Muslims (mostly\nTamil speaking) and the rest being others.\nSri Lanka is multi ethnic, with two separate,\ndistinct ethno-linguistic nations (Singhalese and\nTamils). The two nations differ in religion,\nlanguage and culture. However, colonial powers\nforced unification for administrative purposes.\nWhen the British colonisers left the country\nin the hands of the majority Singhalese in 1948,\nthe Sri Lankan government:\n(a) Decitizenised and disfranchised one million\nTamils living in the plantations;\n(b) Colonised Tamil areas with Singhalese\nsettlers. This state-sponsored colonisation\nwas calculated to destroy the Tamil identity.\n(c) Enacted Singhalese as the only official\nlanguage (1956); discriminated against\nTamils in employment, higher education and\nshare of resources,\n(d) Resorted to state terrorism against the Tamil\npeople to intimidate them into submission;\nA series of violent actions calculated and\nplanned against the Tamils were carried out in\n1956, '58, '61, '72, '75, '77, '77, '79, '81, '83.\nIn sum, the government became an oppressive regime: \"I am not worried about the opinion\nof the Tamil people...now we cannot think of\nthem, not about their lives or their opinion...the\nmore you put pressure in the north, the more\nhappier the Singhala people will be here...\nReally if I starve the Tamils out, the Singhala\npeople will be happy.\" - President J.R. Jeyawardene, Daily Telegraph, 11th July 1983\nDiscriminatory legislative and administrative\nacts together with state terrorism culminated in\nthe demand for the restoration of the Tamil state.\nInitially the struggle was through peaceful\nmeans but when that failed it metamorphosed\ninto an armed liberation war.\nDuring the past 10 years, more than 20,000\nTamils died and 6,000 disappeared having been\nrounded up the security forces. A million or\nmore Tamils have become refugees internally,\nanother 350,000 Tamils externally in Europe and\nNorth America and in Canada alone more than\n90,000 Tamils have sought political asylum,\naccording to Amnesty International.\nAt present, the Tamil people in the North of\nthe island are undergoing severe hardship due to\nthe civil war. The Sri Lankan Government has\nimposed an economic blockade for the past three\nyears. Essential commodities such as food,\nmedicine, fuel and electricity are not available to\nTamil civilians who the Sri Lankan Government\nclaims to be its citizens! Many consequences of\nthis deprivation are in contravention of international law and remain unpublished due to coercive censorship by the Sri Lankan Government.\n\"There is no Tamil problem but only a terrorist problem\" - Sri Lankan President\nD.B. Wijeyatunge in an interview with the Sri\nLankan Sunday Times, 2nd January 1994.\nEven after making this absurd statement, the\nPresident claims he has always been for a political solution! One wonders, what is this political\nsolution for or about if there is no Tamil Problem?\nThough it may be Independence Day for Sri\nLanka, Tamils have nothing to celebrate.\nDoes being a sabbatical take your fancy?

    "content": "Clubs and Societies 7\nThe Last Temptation Of Christ\nWhen Universal Pictures released this religious\nepic, ostensibly about an aspect of Christ's char-act er, the resulting fur ore centred around blasphemy and censorship. This Tuesday, S CC, although not with the approval of all its\nconstituent societies, provides the opportunity\nfor you to experience the film at 7pm in the ICU\nCinema (second floor, Union Building).\nJudged solely as a film, The Last Temptation\nis a masterpiece from Martin Scorsese,\nfrequently hailed as 'America's greatest living\ndirector' and auteur of such diverse classics as\nTaxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas and Age of\nInnocence. The script attracted an impressive\ncast, with Christ portrayed by Willem Dafoe,\nBarbara Hershey as Mary Magdalene and\nHarvey Keitel with the screen's first sympathetic portrait of Judas Iscariot.\nTraditional Catholic themes of sacrifice and\nredemption, which often underpin Scorsese's movies (he trained to be a priest) here dominate\nthe film, albeit with perhaps slightly more\nemphasis than in Kazantzakis' novel. The film's central motif is the reconciliation of the spirit\nand the flesh using Christ as its basis. Although\nthe plot initially resembles the Gospel, it departs\nfrom it in order to portray The Last Temptation\nas being Jesus' desire to subjugate his divinity in\nfavour of his humanity, until such time as he\nfinally recognises his true nature and the\ndichotomy of his character is resolved.\nAs far as blasphemy is concerned, it is\nperhaps worth noting that explicit sex scenes\nbetween Mary and Jesus don't appear. Scorsese\nhimself, when questioned, summarised his\nmotives for making it as being 'to get to know\nChrist better', while one magazine's( Empire)\nmain criticism was that it was ' if anything, a little too devout'. The question of whether or not\nthe representation of Jesus is insulting is still\ndifficult. The main issue which needs to be\nanswered is whether or not the suggestion that\nJesus might have been tempted to renounce his\ndivinity is offensive. While I admit that any\nsimple response would almost certainly prove\ntoo glib, my personal feeling is an inability to\ncomprehend any such offence, if the motive\nbehind the question is irreproachable.\nRelating this to the censorship concern highlighted by the film, this aspect of the controversy\nwhich engulfed The Last Temptation can only be\nresolved by clarifying the distinction between\nthe questioning of a religion and its ridiculing\n(note though that blasphemy laws in this country\napply only to Christianity). This specific debate\nwasn't ever pertinent to The Last Temptation,\nhowever, since at no point was it intended to\n'question' Christianity in any hostile sense. My own opinion on blanket censorship is that\nsuppressing the expression of thought, which is\nwhat it is, serves only to restrict freedom;\nfreedom of thought can achieve solutions, while\nits restriction can only lead to the exacerbation\nof problems\nThe answers offered are clearly personal.\nShould the questions interest you, there will be a discussion about both 'The Last Temptation' and\nthe issues surrounding it following the\nscreening. Whether you decide to show up or not\n(entry is \u00a31 to everyone); think about them.\nThe Mission The Manchurian Candidate\nThis week's joint presentation between CathSoc\nand SCC Exec, The Mission, tells the story of\nChristian missionaries in South American rainforests during the 16th century and does so with\nan emotional impact which few films made\nsince have been able to match.\nThe newly-founded mission of the title\nattracts several different missionaries, most\nnotably Robert De Niro, playing a nobleman\nrepenting after committing a murder and Jeremy\nIrons playing a puritanical priest. When it is\nthreatened by a wrangle between the European\nnations trying to colonise as much of the land as\npossible, the missionaries are torn between\nusing force against their former masters both to\nkeep their 'crusade' going and to protect the\nindigenous population as opposed to following\ntheir own pacifist teachings.\nThe Mission contains themes of environmental awareness and religious conviction. The\nfilm also acts as a suitable precursor to TWF's 'Brazilian Nite'. Entry to the film for everyone\nis just \u00a31, while the film itself starts at 5.50pm in the Concert Hall in the Union Building this\ncoming Thursday.\nThe Manchurian Candidate is widely regarded\nas the finest film about political indoctrination\never made. The film was directed by John\nFrankenheimer (who later went on to make\nBirdman of Alcatraz and The French Connection\nII) and stars Frank Sinatra, Janet Leigh (from\nPsycho) and Angela Lansbury (who received an\nOscar nomination).\nThe film was withdrawn from its original\nrelease in 1962 following JFK's assassination.\nThe reason for this was that certain ideas in the\nfilm closely echo Kennedy's ideological stance,\nor at least the popular impression of it, and the\nplot was hence regarded as highly sensitive.\nThe movie starts with the men of an army\ndivision returning from the Korean War in 1952,\na couple of whom are plagued by horrific night-mares, and all of whom may or may not have\nbeen brainwashed as part of a Sino-Soviet\nmaster plan to control the American political\nlandscape. At least two of the men begin to\nsuspect that a third, who was decorated for\nvalour on their return to the US, may be an\nassassin.\nTo give away any more would be to spoil the\nfilm for those of you who turn up to see it, so I shan't. Essentially, the film questions the relationship between a nation's people and its\ngovernment as well as the nature of government\nitself, much in the same way that thirty years\nlater JFK would question the relationship\nbetween a government's relative responsibilities\nto truth and towards its people.\nDespite The Manchurian Candidate being a masterpiece of cynicism, it offers no trite\nanswers to the issues it raises and recommends\n(c.f. JFK) a greater involvement and interest by\nordinary people in their government (I could\ndraw an easy parallel here to most students' attitudes towards the Union, but I won't). The programme starts at 7pm on Wednesday\nin the ICU Cinema (second floor of the Union\nbuilding) and will be followed by a discussion,\nfor those of you who're interested, about the\nissues it raises. Entry is a mere \u00a31 to anyone\nwith a valid Union card.\nPart 2 of Solving Cryptic Crosswords is on the back page\n\n"
