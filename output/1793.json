    "content": "Does it deserve all the slander?\nI\u2019m not sure how I got into hyperpop, but now I\u2019m\naddicted. My deep dive began after seeing a tweet\nmentioning the genre and I\u2019m easily manipulated, so I\nthought I\u2019d give it a try. With only a little experience\nof 100 gecs, I had lots of new artists to explore. Luckily, Spotify had already made an 8-hour long playlist\nto collect the top tracks of the genre into one easy listening spot (linked at the bottom of this article). Let\u2019s\nbegin.\nI was introduced to hyperpop by Laura Les\u2019 viral\nTikTok track \u2018Haunted\u2019. I\u2019d heard the ten-second clip\ndozens of times on TikTok and the full song is just as\ninfectious as the clip. Making up one half of hyperpop\nroyalty 100 gecs, the band\u2019s influences can be heard\nin Les\u2019 solo work.\nThe vocals could be\ndescribed as anything\nfrom a chipmunk\non acid to an EDM\nghost trapped inside\nyour phone. Far from\na psychedelic remake\nof Alvin and the\nChipmunks, Les\u2019 hit\nsolo single surpasses any 100 gecs track released thus\nfar.\nEasing in gently, I found Glitch Gum\u2019s remixes\nof \u2018Kyoto\u2019 by Phoebe Bridgers and \u2018Just For Me\u2019 by\nPinkPantheress. It physically pains me to say it, but I\nprefer them to the originals. \u2018Kyoto\u2019 sounds like you\u2019ve\nzoned out walking through an arcade in the 80s, think\nStranger Things but it\u2019s one of those film sequences\njust focusing on someone\u2019s face as they walk around.\nA magnificent outro combines beautifully over-produced, pitch-shifted vocals accompanied by huge\npercussive synth stabs that remind me of the King\nFrog ride at the fair that comes to my hometown once\na year. These stabs\nmake the once-horn-now-synth riff\nseem soft and wavy\nin comparison.\nWith similarly\nmorphed vocals,\n\u2018Just For Me\u2019 is also\ntransformed into a\nnew beast (although\ncloser to its original than \u2018Kyoto\u2019). Complete with\nfairground-ride-style crushing synths, Glitch Gum\ntransitions between the\nversesandchoruseswith\nease, making the track\neven more danceable\nthan it was.\nIt would be\nblasphemous to write\na hyperpop article and\nnot mention SOPHIE.\nTragically, SOPHIE died in January 2021 but her\ninfluence on the music industry was immense. After\nreceiving attention for \u2018BIPP\u2019, a single that blends\nelectronic music and pop \u2013 revitalising both genres \u2013\nSOPHIE went on to collaborate and produce with\nnames from Madonna to Charlie XCX. \u201cI can make\nyou feel better\u201d, SOPHIE promises in \u2018BIPP\u2019, going\non to fulfil that straight away. The snagging synths rise\nand fall sounding like a window is being polished and\nsimultaneously I have a new song on my I-want-tohear-this-in-a-club-one-day wish list.\nI listened to so many more good songs and a few\nshit ones too so here\u2019s a quick tour through some of\nmy other favourites. \u2018It gets lonely\u2019 by kmoe sounds\nlike a glitching LCD\nSoundsystem. \u2018NEVER\nFUCKIN KNOW\u2019\nby poutyface is a hazy\nstream of consciousness\nmemory of a house\nparty, which is one of\nthe catchiest tracks in\nmy new favourite genre.\n\u2018They were deleted you say?\u2019 by dashie is the sound if\nyou cover and uncover your ears quickly at a club and\ncan only hear intermittent beats. \u2018Big Boy\u2019 by Payday\ntakes on haters at breakneck speed, rushing from\ninsult to insult \u2013 think the \u2018Money Machine\u2019 intro by\n100 gecs times 100.\nHyperpop is an overarching term covering possibly\nhundreds of niche subgenres someone, somewhere on\nthe internet could (and would) immediately describe\nfor you. I am not that person. Some songs I\u2019ve listened\nto deserve the slander the genre receives but there are\nsome gems hidden away that I am desperate to hear at\na club.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\n22\nMUSIC\nMusic.felix@imperial. ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nThe Valla Are Not Water Rats\nWritten by Rosie Millns Music Writer\nIhave promised friends to go and see The Valla live\nwith them for longer than I dare admit. I am unsure\nwhy I delayed for so long \u2013 admittedly, I have gotten\nlazy at attending gigs recently. After seeing The Valla at\nIslington\u2019s The Water Rats on Friday 28th\nJanuary, I finally understood why those who have caught them live\nare so vocal in their praise of this band, and desperate\nto share this live experience with others.\nThe Valla has been around for about three years at\nthis point, and has an EP and a handful of singles under\ntheirbelt.Thetimetheyhavespenttogetherasabandis\nevident in their sets: the frontman addresses the crowd\nin an easy-going way that suggests years of experience,\nand the band performs with an infectiously high\nenergy. One of the most enjoyable parts of their show\nis the chemistry between the band. Their friendship\nshines through their performance, and you can see just\nhow much fun they are having on stage.\nThe Valla is still making a name for themselves, but\nthat doesn\u2019t mean that they do not have a loyal and\nenthusiastic fanbase. As soon as the band come on, the\ncrowd surges forward, and are dancing and bouncing\nfortheentiretyoftheset.Attendeesarewearingt-shirts\nwith the band\u2019s name on them, and are singing every\nword of every song. I didn\u2019t realise it was a support\nact until the end of their set \u2013 the band is definitely\nheadline material.\nPerhaps the band is following a tried\u2013and\u2013tested\nformula for success with their crowd\u2013pleasing and\ncatchy feel\u2013\ngood bops. You\ncan imagine the\nband playing a\npacked\u2013out tent\nin July of 2016 at\nTruck or Y\u2013Not\nfestival with the\nsummery indie\npop. If they keep\nreleasing songs\nas catchy as \u2018Ice\nCream\u2019, they are\nguaranteed to be played on Jack Saunders\u2019 BBC Radio\nOne Indie Show at some point soon.\nIf you are a fan of bands such as COIN, SPINN, Sea\nGirls, Ten Tonnes, Marsicians, Vistas, or just love some\nfeel\u2013good indie bangers, you should give The Valla a\nlisten, and maybe catch one of their live sets in a small\nvenue whilst you still can.\nOpinion\nLook On His Works, \u201cYe\u201d Mighty, and Despair\nWritten by Tara Pal Chaudhuri Music Editor\nThis is what I know about Kanye West: he raps.\nHis name is not Kanye West. It\u2019s Ye. Ye is separated from his wife, Kim Kardashian, who is now dating\nPete Davidson. Kim Kardashian and Ye have a daughter named North. Ye hates a lot of people including\nTaylor Swift, Drake, and recently, Billie Eilish. Ye ran\nfor president of the United States of America in 2020\nand intends on running again in 2024. I didn\u2019t know,\nhowever, that Ye has been a walking meme on social\nmedia, and this has recently been upscaled by Pete\nDavidson\u2019s entrance into his life.\nYe\u2019s obsession with Pete Davidson (and friends, like\nKid Cudi who Ye has previously collaborated with)\nand his unwelcome intrusion into his nonexistent\nfamilial life has since become an incredible source of\nentertainment for me. His posts about Pete Davidson\nrefer to him as \u201cSkete\u201d, as evidenced by the fact that\nthe word has reached its peak Google Search Trends\npopularity since February 13 2022, having never really\nseenthelightofdayonthesearchenginebefore.Infact,\nwhen a Redditor messaged Ye on Instagram claiming\n\u201cI HEARD DEE HAD SOME INFO ON SKETE!\u201d,\nYe asked who \u201cDee\u201d was and to \u201cplease give me his @\u201d.\nOf course, the Redditor replied with \u201cDEEZ NUTZ\u201d\nand Ye told him to \u201cfind god [sic]\u201d.\nAs much as I wanted to discuss his long spam of\nInstagram posts on this article, I\u2019m sorry to say they\u2019re\nlong gone. If you\u2019re looking for any of the posts I\nreference in this article, please know you\u2019re likely not\ngoing to find them. Ye spams his Instagram and almost\nimmediately deletes the posts. While I write this\narticle, Ye\u2019s new post is telling people to \u201cstop telling\nfathers they should have fought harder to see their\nchildren & start asking mothers why he had to fight at\nall.\u201d Of course, I can\u2019t prove this because it\u2019s gone.\nNeedless to say, it\u2019s (y)easy to forget that although\nyou could spend hours on r/Kanye laughing at his\nantics, his constant rants on social media are indicative\nofanearlypathologicalneedtoshameKimKardashian\nas a wife and a mother while harassing anyone who so\nmuch as lays eyes on poor Skete. This is not helped\nby the fact that a significant fraction of his fans\ngenuinely consider him a genius and encourage him\nto continue making mistakes and learning about the\nworld. An interesting defence of his actions involves\nhim having bipolar disorder, which doesn\u2019t quite\nexcuse his statements and, to some degree, encourages\nthinking of bipolarity as completely debilitating an\nindividual\u2019s sense of logic, empathy, and ability to be a\ndecent human being.\nIndie pop band The Valla take to Islington for a show that they should have been headlining.\n...and at the hilarious (yet concerning) state of Kanye West\u2019s Instagram.\nGig Reviews\nAn elusive Ye post (photo: kanyewest/Instagram)\nThe Valla (photo: Rosie Millns)\nThe end of Kanye Kapitalism?

Looking at the\nodes to it over the past week\nwas something of an eye-opener to our assumedly\nunrestricted past.\nFollowing the\nmajority of civilised history\nwhere religion ruled and\nblasphemy could have you beaten\nor thrown in jail, I think a lot of\npeople who view cancel culture as an\nissue today see it as an assault on the\nverbal impunity of the 20th century.\nUlysses was banned in the UK\nfor 14 years after its publication,\nas it included a chapter in which a\ncharacter masturbates whilst looking\nat a girl on a beach. This doesn\u2019t\neven come close to what would need\nto be included in a film for it to be\nbanned today, and indeed I can\u2019t\nthink of anything horrific enough that\nwould lead to a book being banned.\nJoyce, a Dubliner, wrote the\nbook whilst living in Paris for fear\nof persecution for obscenity from\nthe Irish and English governments.\nThe English Director of Public\nProsecutions at the time described\nit as \u2018glaring obscenity and filth\u2019.\nPoking fun at Catholic Mass and\nimperialism meant that even by\nJoyce\u2019s death in 1941, the Irish\ngovernment did not honour him at his\nfuneral despite his now unequivocal\ncontributions to Irish culture.\nWhilst the above examples clearly\ncome from a place of ingrained\nconservatism, today\u2019s cancel culture\nis often touted as being the work\nof a far-left mob causing people to\nlose their jobs or worse\nbecause the individual\ndoesn\u2019t agree with them.\nIt is certainly not\nonly a left-wing thing,\nin America at least. 30\nUS states are currently\nentertaining campaigns\nto get \u201cobjectionable\u201d\nbooks removed from school\nlibraries to \u201cprotect the kids\u201d. Maybe\nyou wouldn\u2019t want a school library to\nplay host to the aforementioned beach\nwank scene, but reasoning including\n\u201cobjectionable language\u201d, nudity and\n\u201cdepictions of homosexuality\u201d have\nbeen cited in the reasoning of some\nRepublican legislators. The media\nat large have decried China within\nthe last month for enforcing exactly\nthe same stuff, how can legislators\nsay this with a straight face?\nBack in the UK and Nadine\nDorries, perhaps the most overt\nculture warrior in the Cabinet, has\ntaken a step back from complaining\nabout woke snowflakes to say that\nthe Online Harms bill may give the\ngovernment new powers to compel\nstreaming services to remove shows,\nor sections of them, which are deemed\noffensive. You could scarcely make\nthe comparison between these ideas\nand the autocracies we\u2019re currently\non the brink of war with more clear.\nUlysses\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEDITORIAL\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nStatement\nof Intent\nAt Felix we believe that it is always\nin the interest of the students to\nknow. Transparency in the workings\nof the College and the work of\nyour student representatives is key.\nTherefore I, the Felix Editor, on\nbehalf of the team promise that:\nWe will, to the best of our\nability, tell you the whole truth\nand nothing but the truth.\nWe will keep your confidence\nand will only publish something\nyou say to us if you have\nexplicitly said that we can.\nWewillworktoexposeunfairness\nand discrimination in all forms\nthat it takes at the College .\nWe will treat fairly any article\nsent to us, regardless of point of\nview,anddoourbesttoworkwith\nyou to prepare it for publication.\nSignedbySamLovatt\nEditor-in-Chief\nMilitary links\nIn the past, Felix has received a lot\nof flack for stories relating to the\nCCP and the infiltration of UK\nuniversities, and I expect much the\nsame from this week\u2019s front page piece.\nFelix stands firmly within\nthe Imperial community and\ndiscriminates against no one. Chinese\nstudents are an integral and valued\npart of this community and we hold\nno ill feelings towards them and\ncondemn anyone who does.

I have been rowing, skating, ice skating,\nand playing football during my time at university.\nApart from sports, I am quite creative \u2013 I draw and\nsculpt and I\u2019m also into entertainment and comedy,\nso I am creating my own radio show and podcast.\nWhat is your university academic\nbackground?\nI study chemistry at Imperial College. I really\nenjoyed the subject at school and I liked how Imperial\nis a STEM-related university where science is the\nmain focus. Because imperial has so many societies\nand clubs, it sounded great to have the ability to take a\nscience degree and play sports and therefore have the\nbest of both worlds.\nWhat is your sports background?\nI started skating when I was three on quad skates. I\nused to skate around Hyde park every day, and I started\ninline skating when I was five. I have been skating\never since. I joined the London speed skating team\nlast year, because the coach saw me skating through\nHyde park and asked me to trial for their team. I am\nnow working towards competitions this year, and\nlooking to progress professionally within skating.\nA coach at Aldwych Speed Club, an ice skating\nteam, saw potential in me training in ice skating\nduring one of my skating training sessions.\nI also occasionally play for Hammersmith Women\u2019s\nfootball club, where I play right back. I was the captain\nof my school\u2019s football team. There was a big gender\ngap between the guys and girls teams, and I wanted to\nchange that and try to make football more accessible,\nregardless of gender so everyone could enjoy the sport.\nDo you do any sport at Imperial?\nI am also a senior rower at Imperial. I started rowing\nas a novice in my first year at Imperial, and I now\ntrain full time as a senior. I am looking to compete\nin BUCS head, BUCS regatta, and hopefully Henley\nin the coming weeks and months. I am proud of\nmy improvement in the sport and I recently won\nthe \u2018Golden Flipper\u2019 for most improved rower.\nWhat other activities do you do at\nImperial?\nI\u2019m in the process of creating a radio show/podcast\nwith ICRadio, where Imperial students, and any\none really, can write in to us with any issues they\nare having, and we\u2019ll light-heartedly discuss it with\nfriends and guests to try and solve the issue. It\u2019s more\nlike a chat show than a serious project, but I think\nit\u2019ll do really well and I\u2019m excited to see how it goes.\nSo what does an average week look like?\nI wake up at 4:45am on a Monday morning, leave\nthe house at 5:15am on my skates, where I skate to\nImperial Boat Club in Putney which takes about\n45 minutes for a 6 am water session. We usually row\nabout 14-16km from Putney to Chiswick, so the\nsession finishes at around 8am. I do an erg session at\nthe boat house before leaving, rather than doing it\nlater on in the evening because of my busy schedule.\nI then skate from there to South Kensington,\nwhere I get breakfast and get on with my degree.\nI leave campus at 5pm, as I get the train to\nGuildford, which usually takes about 2 hours\nfor a 7pm training session. The training session\nfinished by 8:30, and I make my way home back to\nPaddington where I usually arrive by 11pm to sleep.\nOn Tuesday, I wake up at a late time of 6:45am\nand skate to rowing for a strength and conditioning\nsession by 8 am. University finishes again around 5:30\npm, then I skate to rowing for a 6:15pm water session\nwhich takes 2 hours, similar to the Monday session. I\nleave the boat house at 8pm, and skate home around 9.\nWednesday I just have to do an erg session\nin my own time in the gym, and I do university\nwork in my own time. I\u2019ve got ice skating again\nat 7:15pm, so I make my way to Guilford.\nThursday is a repeat of Tuesday, normally.\nFriday is again an erg in my own time, and\nthat is it for the day! No skating training!\nBut I do university work in my own time.\nSaturday is a big day. We have a 6:45am start at\nthe boat house, which I skate to, where it\u2019s a longer\nrower outing, usually about 18-20km, followed by\ncircuits at the boat house, which if you don\u2019t know, is\nabsolute pain! Sunday is an off day from rowing, but I\ndo have skating training with the speed skating team.\nIt is from 10-12 at Tatem park, which is quite a trek,\nwhere they have the only outdoor track in London.\nThis week we sat down with a close friend of ours, Yasmin. She has to be one of the craziest people at Imperial who has the most packed\ntimetable we\u2019ve ever seen. We felt tired just listening to what she does in an average week, I hope you enjoy reading this interview.\nKonrad Hohendorf Sport Editor\nAmanda Barden Sport Editor\n\n"

CPNI\nguidance highlights the dangers of \u201cduel\nuse\u201dtechnology,whichcanbedeveloped\nunder the guise of a civillian technology\nbut then redeployed for military use.\nAn Imperial spokesperson said \u201cThese\nprojects are fundamental scientific\nresearch, carried out with partners and\ncollaborators around the world and\nresearch findings are shared openly.\nAll partnerships and collaborations at\nImperial undergo thorough scrutiny and\nare regularly reviewed, working closely\nand regularly with the appropriate\nGovernment departments, with\nour commitments to UK national\nsecurity given the utmost importance\u201d.\nFelixunderstandsthatImperialCollege\ndoes not carry out classified research.\nSome examples of sector-wide\ncollaboration are fairly brazen. One\nUniversityofSouthamptonprofessorhas\nreportedly co-authored 18 papers with a\nChinese scientist who designs warheads.\nChinese research institutions of\nconcern usually fall within the group\nof Seven Sons universities, which have\nstrong and indiscrete connections to\nthe People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA).\nOther funding sources of concern\ninclude Huawei, the Chinese telecoms\ngiant which Imperial has consistently\nreceived flack for in the media and from\nImperial College Union. In January\n2021, Imperial College Union\u2019s council\nvoted to condemn the association of\nImperial with Huawei on the grounds\nof human rights abuses committed\nagainst the Uyghur minority by the\nChinese government, and Huawei\u2019s\nsuspected involvement in this\npersecution through the development\nof AI technology to track Uyghurs.\nHuawei remain the primary funding\nbody for Imperial College\u2019s Venture\nCatalyst challenge. The College also\nhas \u00a31.77 million invested in Tencent\nholdings, who Felix has found to have\nfiled patents for facial recognition\ntechnology which touted improved\naccuracy on the identification of\n\u201cminority groups, such as Uighurs...\nand black people\u201d. The patent also\ndescribed Uighurs as \u201cspecial\u201d.\nImperial received around\n25% of the \u00a320 million from\ncompanies sanctioned by the US.\nOn the donors of money received\nby Imperial from US-sanctioned\nChinese companies, The Times said\n\u201cThis included the aerospace company\nAVIC, which supplies the Chinese air\nforce with fighter jets, AECC, which\nprovides military jet engines. It also\nincluded funding from the Beijing\nInstitute for Aeronautical Materials,\nan AECC subsidiary from which\nit has received at least \u00a32 million.\u201d\nAn Imperial spokesperson said that\nall partnerships and collaborations\nundergo \u201cthorough scrutiny\u201d, were\nregularly reviewed, and that Imperial\u2019s\ncommitment to UK national security\nwas of the \u201cutmost importance\u201d.\nA 2019 Foreign Affairs Committee\n(FAC) report titled \u2018A cautious\nembrace: defending democracy in the\nage of autocracies\u201d commented on the\ninfluence of international money on\nUK research. The committee stated that\nsome UK institutions are \u201creluctant to\nrespond to allegations of influence due\nto their reliance on income from student\nrecruitment and research grants\u201d.\nImperial College is particularly\npoorly placed to suffer from a\nwithdrawal of Chinese student\nrecruitment, with Chinese students\naccounting for 23.4% of the total in\n2019/20. Imperial are far from the\nuniversity most reliant on Chinese\ntuition fees, with UCL apparently on\ntop with 11,200 Chinese students,\ncompared to Imperial\u2019s roughly 4,660.\nIn 2019, the government published\na white paper titled \u201cInternational\nEducation Strategy\u201d, in which the case\nfor a whole government approach to\nboosting the UK higher education\nsector on the global stage is made. That\nbeing said, the FAC noted that the\ngovernment\u2019s international education\nstrategy involves the Department for\nEducation and the Department for\nInternational Trade, but not the Foreign\nOffice. It adds that China is explicitly\nmentioned over 20 times in the white\npaper, however none of these mentions\nare related to intellectual security.\nAccording to The Times, \u201cResearchers\ncoming to study at UK universities on\ndual-use technology must be vetted if\nthey are not from close allies. Research\nis subject to export controls, and the\ngovernment can also intervene in\nintellectual property acquisitions under\nthe National Security and Investment\nAct\u201d.

    "content": "Political entities are deeply connected with the personal experience of individuals, this is a crucial\npoint of Hanisch\u2019s 1970 essay The Personal is Political.\nWe are not necessarily responsible for problems and\ndilemmas in our everyday life, and neither can we always be capable of solving these on our own \u2013 rather\nthey must be seen an issue of the society as a whole and\nbe approached as such. That is the premise of Sonali\nBhattacharyya\u2019sTwoBillionBeats,wherewefollowthe\nups and downs of Asha (Safiyya Ingar), who embodies\nthe clich\u00e9 of the almost edgy, witty, rebellious teenag-er. Confronted with all the trouble that entails the life\nof a poor young woman of colour, she clings onto her\nidealism and attempts to fight back\u2026 whatever that\nis supposed to mean exactly. In contrast, her younger\nsister Bettina (Anoushka Chadha) would much rather\nnaively stroll through life\u2013her biggest desire is ostensibly to get a hamster\u2013but she must also realise that this\nis a privilege that her role does not allow her to attain.\nThat is the dynamic that evolves throughout the play.\nWhat immediately struck me, were the soliloquies\nof Asha. We, the audience, were part of a history lesson \u2014 spread over the whole play. Every now and then\nwewouldlearnabouttheconflictbetweenGhandiand\nAmbedkar or about the troublesome history of suffragettes in England. We learn that popular figures held\ncontroversial positions and that the truly repressed\nones tend to be forgotten or actively ignored.

And this made Asha\u2019s struggle\neven more relatable and the play as a whole even more\nintimate.\nThis was amplified by the comfy atmosphere of\nthe theatre, where the boundary between stage and\naudience is essentially non-existent. It felt like I was\noverhearing a conversation at a bus stop: this level\nof authenticity is proof of a thought-out play and a\nwell-executed direction (Nimmo Ismail).

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n6\nExcess fertiliser is choking our waterways but help could be on its way through low-cost new developments.\nHalf of the global population is supported by nitrogen fertiliser. Their\ndevelopment and use in the Green Revolution hugely increased crop yields, but\nnow, across the globe, only 35% of those\napplied are used by harvested crops.\nThe excess fertiliser amounts to 75 million tonnes annually and has devastating consequences on the environment.\nNitrogen sensors could allow growers\nto fine-tune the application of nitrogen\nfertilisers to be applied at the optimum\ntime and quantity.\nOverfertilisation has rendered 12%\nof once-arable land unusable. Fertiliser\nruns off into waterways, where nitrogen,\nwhich is essential for plant growth and\noften in limited quantities, allows plants\nsuch as algae to grow exponentially.\nBacteria can then feed on this algae and\nconsume the water\u2019s oxygen, creating\nthe dramatically named \u201cdead zones\u201d, of\nwhich there are now over 500 identified\nin coastal areas. Furthermore, as the oxygen runs out, bacteria turn to nitrogen\ncompounds instead, and consume their\nfriends to release nitrous oxide - a greenhouse gas 300 times more potent than\ncarbon dioxide.\nGrowers are caught in a dilemma: too\nmuch fertiliser and the environment and\ntheir wallets suffer; too little and their\ncrop yields may diminish. New sensors\ndeveloped by researchers at Imperial\nCollege London monitor the soil for\nammonium, pH, and conductivity. They\ncombine this data with weather data and\napplication time using machine learning\nto predict soil nitrogen levels over the\nfollowing 12 days. The ammonium data\ncan accurately predict nitrogen uptake\nby plants (microbes convert ammonia\ninto nitrates, which plants can absorb).\nAccording to lead researcher Dr Max\nGrell, this technology should empower\ngrowers by allowing them to fine-tune\nfertilisation to the specific needs of the\nsoil.\nTechniques are advancing beyond soil\nnutrient measurement and even beyond\nthis world, quite literally. A research\nteam at the University of Illinois recently published their findings from a novel\nexperiment. They flew a plane, equipped\nwith powerful hyperspectral sensors,\nover a corn crop three times. The sensors\nwere designed to pick up certain infrared and far-red light radiation, the type\nemitted by leaves under nutrient stress.\nTheir sensors were consequently able\nto estimate the nitrogen content of the\nplants themselves, with an impressive\n85% accuracy. This is a leap forward\nfrom the lower-resolution satellite tech-niques. However, satellites still have a\nrole as they could be equipped with hy-perspectral sensors, which would allow\ngrowers to determine the nutrient status\nof huge areas of crops at the start of the\ngrowing season.\nCara Burke Science Editor\nEdited by: Jamie John\nRayan Kamal\nCara Burke\nMarek Cottingham\nScience\nCould AI help rescue coastal dead zones?\nPhoto credits: Wikimedia Commons, NASA Earth Observatory\nPhoto credits: Nilfanion, CC-BY-SA-4.0\nACROSS THE\nGLOBE ONLY 35%\nOF (NITROGEN\nFERTILISERS)\nAPPLIED ARE USED\nBY HARVESTED\nCROPS\n\u201c\nThe algal bloom in Lake Erie in 2011 could be viewed from above\nSpace missions and soaring\nprofits?\nTesting nitrogen content in soils and\ncrops has the potential to significantly\nraiseprofits,butresultshavesofarbeen\ninconsistent. Measuring soil nitrogen is\noften a lengthy and costly process that\nrequires samples to be sent to a lab.\nBy the time the information gets to\nthe growers, the soil nitrogen content\nis more than likely to have changed.\nMeasuring crop nutrient status has either required farmers to painstakingly\n\u201cscan\u201d crop leaves or rely on low-res-olution satellite pictures. But better\ntechniques will soon be on the market:\nlow-cost soil sensors should be available for commercialisation within 3-5\nyears, and NASA is already planning to\nsend hyperspectral sensors into space.\nThe market size for agricultural sensors\nis estimated to grow from $1.55 billion\nin 2021 to $3.7 billion by 2028, and\nexpand at a compound annual growth\nrate (CAGR - the mean annual growth\nrate of an investment over time) of\n13.6%. With innovations such as these,\nthere\u2019s hope we could soon see life return to our dead zones.\n\n"

While the tower looked alright\nfrom a distance, you only had to get up\nclose to it to realise that it wasn\u2019t made of\nstone. However, it was only when I was able\nto pick up the tower and look at what was\nwritten on the bottom that I knew there\nhad been some funny business.\u201d\nThe official statement from the College\nsaid that enquiries were under way and a\nfull QC-written report would be available\nnext time a national newspaper went to\ncourt to gain access to it.\nStudents have reacted in an amused way\nto the news and a new tradition of pushing\nover the tower has emerged. This comes\nmuch to the distress of College management\nwho have employed security guards to\nprevent this happening and warned any\nstudent thinking of doing so that their\nacademic credit score would suffer as a\nconsequence.\nSolutions to the problem have not been\nforthcoming and College staff have had to\nremind President Alice Gast that shouting\nat the tower until it stops \u201cbeing so fucking\ndifficult\u201d is not a viable solution.\nNB. Just before this issue went to print, there was\na shocking update to the story.

She is a performer whose virtuoso talent\ncan only be witnessed in person. Her immense physical\npresence, despite being just over five feet tall, is nothing short of utterly mesmerising to watch; each expression is precisely rendered but made to look effortless.\nHer jelly like face jolts with jubilation and scrunches\nwith contemplative confusion at her husband\u2019s, played\nby Marcello Magni, lyrical and metaphysical musings -courtesy of Omar Elerian\u2019s new translation of Eug\u00e8ne\nIonesco\u2019s The Chairs.\nMagni and Hunter\u2019s shared emotional intelligence\nand physical prowess as clowns is so brilliant that they\nare able to imbue each of the titular chairs, inanimate\nobjects, with a living presence of their own. Each block\nof wood is alive and breathing as if they were a character there in the room with them, with us, with me.\nWith each added chair, a chorus of life emerges on\nstage, despite there only being three performers. The\nalmost two hour runtime glided by.\nTheatre of the Absurd can be dense and difficult to\ndigest. Beckett\u2019s Waiting for Godot was famously described as a play where \u201cNothing happens twice.\u201d But\nElerian\u2019s text is polished and light, fluttering like a little\nbird from philosophical rants to witty one liners about\nCovid. The decision to not put Ionesco on a pedestal is\ncrucial in keeping the production fresh. The 20th\ncentury French-Romanian playwright\u2019s words have been\ncleavedfromthepageanddelicatelyreconstructed.The\nthought of slicing up Shakespeare is heretic for many\nBritish theatre makers. The result is a version inspired\nby the original more than anything else, but this is what\nmakes the production so poignant and entertaining.\nThe Speaker, a mysterious third character whose arrival\nhas been eagerly awaited by Magni and Hunter played\nby a hilariously bemused Toby Sedgewick, delivers a\ndeliberately anticlimactic and haphazard monologue\nthat brings Ionesco kicking and screaming into the 21st\ncentury. Surveillance Capitalism? Society of the Spectacle? What does it all mean? But Elerian is not didac-tic. He does not want his audience to realise anything\nin particular, but rather invites them to find a meaning\nfor themselves. At a time when a significant number of\nproductions wear their political perspectives on their\nsleeves, the Almeida\u2019s production of The Chairs emerges as unique, not in that it is apolitical, but rather an-ti-political. It is dada on stage and it is gorgeous.\nAre you an aspiring arts\ncritic?\nVisit our Facebook page for\nmore details on free press\ntickets for London shows!\nKathryn Hunter, Marcello-Magni, and (of course) the chairs...\nCredits: Photo/ Helen Murray\nThe Chairs plays at the Almeida Theatre until the 5th\nMarch 2022\nCredits: Photo/ Helen Murray\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 10TH FEBRUARY 2020\nSCIENCE\n7\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nTwo novel approaches to cancer\nmay bring us closer to the cure\nCancer killed close to 10 million\npeople in 2020. Despite the treatments available such as chemotherapy\nand the massive investment in research\non cancer, an all-encompassing cure has\nnot been found yet. However, two novel\napproaches to understanding and fighting cancer could help light the path towards a cancer-free world.\nDr Kenneth J. Pienta is pioneer in the\ndevelopment of the cancer swamp theo-ry. Pienta analyses cancer from an eco-logicalperspective,characterisingitasan\ninvasive species that alters the surrounding environment. The different cells of\nthe body would be the local plants and\nanimals, while the space would be a specific part of tissue instead of biomes such\nas cabanas or jungles. Invasive species\nare species that have been introduced to\nanewenvironment,andareproliferating\nexponentially in a way that is detrimental to the ecosystem. They have two key\ncharacteristics: a very high reproductive\nrate and the ability to adapt to a changing environment. In all healthy ecosys-tems, there is a constant flow and cycling\nof nutrients. Small disturbances of the\nnatural order of ecosystems make species\nmore resistant, like the immune system\nafter facing an infection, provided that\nthe disturbance is not too much to withstand results in permanent damage.\nEutrophication is the nutrient enrichment of an ecosystem. If done slowly,\neutrophication can be positive for the\necosystem, guaranteeing its perpetuity\nand increasing biodiversity. On the other other hand, rapid eutrophication in\naquatic ecosystems is worse than a massive fire in a forest. A typical example of\nthe negative effects of eutrophication is\nalgae blooms. Fertilisers that are applied\nto crops can end up in rivers and oceans.\nThey suffer abrupt increases in the concentrations of nitrogen and phospho-rus, which are all limiting factors for\nalgae growth. Consequently, algae start\nto duplicate massively, consuming massive amounts of oxygen and food in\nturn. The rest of the organisms such as\nfish and crustaceans die due to the lack\nof resources. Algae blooms do not end\nwell even for the algae. As the algae have\nindirectly killed the other living organ-isms, the nutritional cycle is broken and\nthere are no nutrient suppliers anymore.\nThus, the algae eventually die and no\nliving being is left. It is the same story in\ncancer development. In the case of can-cer, as the abnormal growth is caused\nby the cancerous cells and not an external factor like the case of algae bloom,\nwe call it autoeutrophication. Cancer\ncells are ecosystem engineers, capable of\nchanging the cyclical flow of nutrients\nto a linear one, in which they receive\nall the resources. Due to the defective\ngenetic material of cancer cells, these\nhave uncontrollable cell growth, multiplying rapidly to huge numbers. They\nconsume all available oxygen, creating a\nhypoxic environment. In response to the\nlow levels of oxygen, cancer cells change\ntheir metabolism and begin anabolically\n(without need for oxygen) consuming\nglucose, releasing lactic acid that increases the acidity of the environment.\nAlso, cancer cells take up all the glucose\nand other essential nutrients, not leaving\nanything to the rest of the cells, making\nthem \u2018asphyxiate\u2019 and \u2018starve\u2019 to death.\nThis ultra-toxic environment is deadly\neven for the cancer cells. These undergo\na process of natural selection, in which\nonly the fittest (and hence most lethal)\ncancer cells will survive, prepared to\nspread their kingdom of horror to other\ntissues of the body.\nPrevention ecology focuses on solving the environmental damage caused\nby human activity. This includes taking\nactive actions like cleaning the lake that\ncaused the algae bloom. The oncologi-cal equivalent would be extracting the\ntumour. However, the best way to cure\na malady is to prevent it. In ecology, this\nwould be called conservation: protecting the ecosystems by creating rules and\nprotectedareas.Incancer,the\u201cconservation\u201d would be having a healthy lifestyle\nsuch as sleeping 8 hours or doing exer-cise. Another thing, more innovative, is\ncancer vaccines.\nHow do vaccines work? Vaccines con-tainweakenedordeadpathogensthatare\ninoculated to the person - this triggers a\nresponse of the immune system that destroys the weakened pathogen. The immune system will \u2018remember\u2019 the traits\nof this pathogen. In the future, when\nthe real pathogen tries to invade the\nbody, the immune system will be able to\nreact more effectively. Vaccines are kind\nof \u2018training\u2019 the immune system \u2013 like\ndoingamockexamtobebetterprepared\nfor the real one. Cancer vaccines should\nbe able to prevent us from contracting\ncancer in the future. Although cancer\nvaccines are currently used to complement other therapies, a cancer vaccine\nfor the whole population is still not developed yet because cancerous cells have\nmultiple mechanisms to elude the immune system.\nConventional cancer treatments such\nas chemotherapy or radiotherapy are\nextreme and usually cause permanent\ndamage to the patient. There is a growing interest in cancer vaccines and im-munotherapyingeneral becausetheyare\nless invasive, but are more complicated\nto develop.\nWang Guo Science Writer\nThe cancer swamp theory uses ecology to study cancer, and cancer vaccines could prevent the disease entirely.\nCancer cells dividing to form a tumour, in amongst normal cells\nThe algal bloom in this river covers it in green!\nPhoto credits: Cancer Research UK, CC-BY-SA-4.0\nPhoto credits:\nFelix Andrews, CC-BY-SA-3.0\n\n"

Funded\nby \u00a3500,000 of public funds and managed by the Conservatives\u2019 favourite PR\nfirm M&C Saatchi, the programme sees\nthe Home Office partner with charities\nand law enforcement, targeting the rollout of end-to-end encryption (E2EE)\nacross social media.\nIn 2014, former defence contractor\nEdward Snowden leaked over 1.7 million classified intelligence files to investigative journalists. The documents\nrevealed how intelligence agencies in\nthe Five Eyes alliance \u2013 comprising of\nthe USA, the UK, Canada, Australia,\nand New Zealand \u2013 gathered massive\namounts of data indiscriminately, from\npeople around the world. American\ntech companies, including Apple, Google, Microsoft and Facebook, had either\nbeen forced to support these activities,\nor had backdoors placed in their systems\nwithout their knowledge.\nIn order to regain users\u2019 trust, tech\ncompanies have spent billions improving the security of their services, and introducing end-to-end encryption. E2EE\nis where communication between users\nare secured throughout the message\u2019s\njourney through the Internet \u2013 nobody,\nnot even the messaging service provider,\ncan view the content being sent. Most\nmajor communication apps now support E2EE, with Facebook\u2019s announcement that it will roll out E2EE across its\ncommunications platforms finally sparking objections from the Government.\nThe stated aim of the campaign is, on\nthe surface, understandable \u2013 the Government claims that encryption will allow sexual abuse of children to go unde-tected. The Government cites data from\na USA-based child safety charity, whose\nresearch shows that 94% of reported\ncases of Child Sexual Abuse Material\n(CSAM) originates from Facebook ser-vices. An estimated 70% of reports \u2013\napproximately 14 million \u2013 would not\nexist if the company had gone ahead\nearlierwith its rollout of E2EE. Former\nMet Police Commissioner, Cressida\nDick, has also stated that E2EE makes\nit \u201cimpossible\u201d for the police to do their\njobs, specifically citing the fight against\nterrorism. The UK Government is not\nalone in their opposition \u2013 the FBI has\nrepeatedly and publicly attacked the\nwidespread use of encryption, and the\nAustralian government has passed legislation forcing companies to hand over\ndata or face fines.\nIt is difficult to argue against policy\naimed at preventing terrorism and protecting children. The campaign, howev-er,islittlemorethanapropagandadrive,\nmisrepresenting statistics to further the\nGovernment\u2019s interests. Terrorism is not\nprevented by a lack of encryption \u2013 as\nexposed by Snowden, security agencies\nhave no lack of data, and the 2015 attacks in Paris were organised completely\nover unencrypted text messages. While\nthe example of child abuse is emotive \u2013\nhelped by the M&C Saatchi\u2019s shrewd recruitment of charities such as Barnardo\u2019s\n\u2013 the reality is that very few surveillance\napplications are made for this crime,\nwith child abuse offences comprising\nonly 0.2% of surveillance requests in\nGermany.\nThe campaign has been denounced by\ndigital rights groups around the world,\nincluding the UK\u2019s independent data\nwatchdog, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), who have stated\nthat any delay to the rollout of E2EE\n\u201cleaves everyone at risk, including children\u201d. Encryption underpins the modern internet \u2013 online banking, private\nphotos,andyourlocationareallprotect-ed by the same mechanism the Government hopes to undermine.\nThis is but the latest move in a series\nof authoritarian moves by the Government. A move against encryption\nwould not only show the technological\nilliteracy of our lawmakers, but also set\na dangerous precedent for authoritarian\nregimes around the world to follow.\nThe Government vs\nEncryption\nShrey Bohra Science Writer\nThis week in Science...\nOmicron infections plagued England in December 2021\nWatch out! Robber flies on the hunt\nHmmmm yummy! Deep-sea arctic sponges munch on fossils\nImperial and Ipsos MORI\u2019s ongoing REACT coronavirus monitoring\nprogram found a rapid increase in COVID-19 infections in the UK\nduring December 2021, which was concurrent with the rapid spread of\nOmicron, both within the UK and internationally. Infection rates varied\nacross the country, with the highest rates occurring in London, where the\nR-number was estimated to be 1.62 in December. The results came from\nanalysis of swab tests taken at home by over 97,000 participants, between\n23rd November and 14th December. Adults who had received a booster\nwere three to four times less likely to be infected than adults who had had\ntwo doses.\nResearchers have discovered how robber flies avoid obstacles as they hunt\ndown prey. They wait in ambush for their prey and feed on other insects.\nThe scientists investigated how the flies navigate while flying towards a\ntarget, by placing large objects in the insects\u2019 flight paths. Because of its\nsmall brain size, the robber fly relies on much simpler navigation systems\nthan humans and other mammals. It uses two simple navigation systems.\nThe first is called \u201cpure proportional navigation\u201d, which allows them to\ntrack their prey, and the second is a simple obstacle avoidance algorithm.\nCombining the two has allowed the robber fly to successfully chase prey\nat high speeds. \u201cThe reaction speed of these flies is an order of magnitude\nfaster than ours,\u201d said Dr Samuel Fabian, lead author of the study. The\nhope is that understanding how small organisms make such decisions can\nhelp inspire the design of simple, light aerial drones.\nA colony of deep-sea sponges, located between 700 and 1000 metres\ndown in the central Arctic Ocean, have been found to be snacking on\nthe fossilised bed on which they lie. Sponges are filter feeders, but at\nthose depths there is very little current. The colony is placed on a bed of\nfossilised life between 2,000 and 3,000 years old. Carbon isotopes in the\nsponge tissue closely matched those of the dead matter, which suggests\nthe animals are consuming it. Microbes that live within the sponges have\nbeen found to have enzymes capable of breaking down the fossils into\nconsumable products. Sponges are not very mobile, but can slowly move\nusing spiky spiracles to get around the sea bed to find more food.\nFROM AROUND THE WORLD...\nClimate change causing increased plant growth in Antarctica\nPlant growth in Antarctica is accelerating as a result of climate warming.\nThere are only two native flowering plants in Antarctica, Deschampsia\nantarctica and Colobanthus quitensis. Over a period of ten years, from\n2009 to 2019, the scientists recorded the growth of these plants on sites\non Signy Island, a small island in the South Orkney Islands of Antarctica.\nThey compared their observations with similar studies at the same sites\nover the past 50 years, and found that the growth rate and population\ndensity of the plants had both increased with time. Peter Convey, a\nmember of the team and a scientist at the British Antarctic Survey, said,\n\u201cThe most novel feature of this is not the idea that something is growing\nfaster. It\u2019s that we think we\u2019re starting to see what is almost like a step\nchangeoratippingpoint.\u201dTherearefearsthattheincreaseintemperature\ncouldallowinvasivespeciestocolonisetheregion,andoutcompetenative\nplants, fundamentally altering the ecosystem of Antarctica.\nPhoto credit: Robert Worrall under Unsplash licence\nFROM IMPERIAL\n\n"

    "content": "Greetings and salutations to my readers for this\nweek\u2019scolumn.Todaywe\u2019llbelookingataTurkish\nrestaurant called \u201cSelale\u201d - which means waterfall. The\nrestaurant is located in Haringey, North London and\nthe area is known to be the food hub for everything\nTurkish, be it your Turkish delight, baklavas, kebabs\nor even a place to buy Turkish style curtains and gold.\nThe restaurant is an hour away from Imperial via\nbus and train but if you\u2019re ever in north london, it\u2019s\ntypically roughly no more than a 30 min bus ride to the\nrestaurant.\nThe restaurant\u2019s interior is very chic and colourful\nwithamodernandcleanlooktoit,withasubtleTurkish\naccent. The inside was well lit, making it ideal for taking\nphotos and the exterior is well designed with massively\nwide windows showing you the outside when you eat.\nHospitality was also quick and efficient given how busy\nit was on the day which was very much appreciated. In\nTurkish restaurants, they always provide salad, bread\nand typically a yoghurt-y sauce for \u201cfree of charge\u201d. I\nwrite free of charge in quotation marks because it\u2019s not\nentirely free, as it is something actually included in the\nservice charge, however in most restaurants nothing\ncomes along with the service charge and in Turkish\nrestaurants they do, which is better than nothing.\nTo start us off we ordered a combination of hot and\ncold Mezes (\u00a316.90), Meze meaning side dishes in\nTurkish. This included: Hummus, Kisir (couscous),\nSarma (stuffed grape leaves), Shakshuka, Calamari,\nHalloumi, Sigara B\u00f6re\u011fi (stuffed and fried filo pastry)\nand Sucuk (Turkish style spicy and fermented sausage).\nAll the Mezes we ordered were tasty and unique in\nflavour and texture. Our favourite out of the bunch was\nthe Sigara Borek which was served fresh with stuffed\nfeta cheese with finely chopped parsley. It was very\ntasty and soft on the inside and the outer pastry was\ncrispy enough to want to order more. The crispy-ness\ngives you a good crunch when you bite into it without\nfalling apart. Despite the strange combination, the\nsigara borek surprisingly worked really well with the\ntatar sauce which was served with the Mezes. Although\nnot bad, we found our least favourite Meze to be the\nShakshuka; for this dish the flavours just did not hit\nthe right spot on our taste buds, and we didn\u2019t like the\nfact that it was served cold.\nFor the mains, let\u2019s start off with the Manti(\u00a314.90)\nwhich is Turkish style mini dumplings. Manti is\ntypically stuffed with minced lamb or beef and served\nhot, with a generous drizzle of garlic yoghurt and\nspicy butter sauce to give the overall look of the dish\na wonderful shine. From the get go, the dish looked\npromising but I did expect it to taste more exciting. The\nbutter sauce felt like it was just there to provide colour\nwith not much spice. However, the manti tasted pretty\ngood with no specific complaints. The garlic yoghurt\nwent well with the manti and I was satisfied with my\nmeal. Along with the manti, I ordered Ayran(\u00a32.90),\nwhich is a Turkish yoghurt drink. Unfortunately, the\nAyran was just not doing it for me. Ayran is made to be\nsalty, however Selale\u2019s wasn\u2019t salty at all. I presume it\u2019s\nto cater towards different customers, but unfortunately\nit was unsatisfactory.\nMoving on to our second main we ordered\nIskender(\u00a318.90), which is a combination sliced lamb\ndoner kebab and pita bread (sometimes croutons)\ntopped with a hot tomato sauce and sizzling sheep\nbuttermilk on top. Along with this extravaganza you\nget a side of yogurt, bringing the meal together. The\nmeat in the Iskender was well cooked and juicy, and the\numami provided by the tomato sauce was delicious. My\nonly qualm is that I typically like my bread a bit crispier\nand not very soggy. Overall the dish was very filling,\nbut nothing stood out to me, just like the manti.\nFinally for the dessert, we got complimentary\nTurkish tea and baklava. We also ordered a Ferrero\nRocher cheesecake(\u00a35.90). One thing I can appreciate\nis that the teas and baklavas are given for free. The\nbaklava served wasn\u2019t the \u2018typical\u2019 baklava you might\nknow of, but it does come in various shapes and sizes.\nTo add to this point, our baklava had walnuts instead\nof the traditional pistachio filling. The Ferrero Rocher\ncheesecake was the most anticipated, but without any\nsugar-coating, it wasn\u2019t good at all. The cheesecake\ntastedwaytoodenseandsignificantlylackedtheflavour\nof Ferrero Rocher. Due to the denseness, the aftertaste\nwasn\u2019t very good as well. Ultimately, we believe they\nfailed to make the dessert airy which is what a good\ncheesecake should be.\nIn conclusion, the food was solid and there\u2019s not\nmuch to complain about, but there was also nothing\nspecial behind it. Given that the price tag was\ncomparable to more high-end restaurants, I expected\nsomething more than just standard. It could be that the\ndishes we got weren\u2019t their specialty, as there are many\ndishes to choose from. Regardless, if it isn\u2019t anything\nspecial they shouldn\u2019t charge so much for it.\nFRIDAY 18TH FEBRUARY 2022\n23\nFood.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nSelale - bringing Turkey\u2019s waterfall \t\t\nto North London\nRestaurant Review\nPricerange: \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\nSignaturedishes: Kebab\nStyle: Casual\nEdited by: Bencan Yalcin\nFood\nManti - Turkish style dumplings\nPhoto credits: Melis Efecan\nPhoto credits: Bencan Yalcin\nIskender - Thinly sliced lamb, topped with a rich tomamto sauce\nPhoto credits: Bencan Yalcin\nFerrero Rocher Cheesecake , Ice Cream and Baklava\nReviewed by Bencan Yalcin Food Editor\n\n"

    "content": "UK gov\u2019t to offer contracts for\nrenewable energy projects annually\nEnvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nThe UK Government has increased\nthe frequency of auctions for renewable energy projects in an attempt to\nboth boost investment and jobs as well\nas further commit to its climate goals.\nPreviously, the Contracts for Difference\n(CfD) auctions were held every two\nyears, which allowed private energy and\nrenewables companies to bid for public\nenergy contracts. Since its inception,\nthe CfD auction scheme has reduced\nthe per-unit price of offshore wind by\naround 65%.\nThe hope is that renewable energy\nproviders will be more incentivised to\nbid for contracts, which will contribute\nto the growth of the UK\u2019s renewable\nenergy infrastructure. The use of\nauctions helps to drive down the cost of\nthese technologies, cost reductions that\ncan be transferred to the end-user.\nIt is predicted that offshore wind\nwill supply the majority of the UK\u2019s\npower within the next 30 years, with\n95 gigawatts (GW) being generated by\n2050. Today, offshore wind generates\naround 10GW, which is enough to\npower seven million homes.\nIn terms of climate goals, the UK\nhas many. The Government hopes to\nreach net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG)\nemissions by 2050. In its contributions\nto the Paris Agreement, the UK also\ncommitted to reducing its GHG\nemissions by 68% by 2030 compared\nto 1990 levels. This commitment\nwas regarded by the Climate Change\nCommittee (CCC) as \u2018a decisive\ncommitment to a net-zero emissions\ntrajectory, consistent with the Paris\nAgreement\u2019.\nSince 1990, the UK has reduced its\ncarbon footprint from 809.1 million\nmetric tonnes of CO2\nequivalent to\n414.1 million metric tonnes in 2021,\nwhich equates to around 40% of 1990\nlevels. However, to reach the 68%\nreduction by 2030, the UK will have\nto cap its production at 358 million\nmetric tonnes of CO2\nequivalent. With\nthe increase in renewable energy project\nauctions, the hope is that offshore wind\nwill play a big part in that reduction.\nOn the change, Business and Energy\nSecretary Kwasi Kwarteng remarked,\n\u201cThemoreclean,cheapandsecurepower\nwe generate at home, the less exposed\nwe will be to expensive gas prices set by\ninternational markets.\u201d\nThis kind of remark has newfound\nsignificance since the news of the rise\nin the energy price cap earlier this year,\nwhich is estimated to leave six million\nhouseholds unable to pay their energy\nbills. An increase in offshore wind\npower can also be seen as part of the\njourney towards energy independence\nin post-Brexit Britain. Only last month\nwasKwartengcelebratinga\u00a3210million\ninvestment in the Rolls-Royce small\nnuclear reactor (SMR) project.\n\u201cThrough the SMR programme, not\nonly could we ensure greater energy\nindependence, but create new British\nintellectual property we can then export\naroundtheworldsowe\u2019relessdependent\non other countries for technology.\u201d\nKwarteng said.\nDiscussion on the green credentials of\nnuclearreactorsaside,wemustapproach\nany celebration of green energy projects\nwith an air of measured scepticism.\nThe UK government\u2019s track record on\ncommitting fully to climate targets\nhas been historically lax. In a report\npublished last year, analysts from the\nCCC discovered that the UK had only\nprovidedsufficientambitionwithinfour\nout of a possible 21 key decarbonisation\nareas.\nThe report revealed a worrying \u2018policy\ngap\u2019 that, if not filled by effective and\nenforceable green policies, would result\nin the UK missing its climate targets.\nAnother incredibly worrying revelation\nis that the GHG reductions reported\nare territorial in nature, meaning they\nintentionally omit GHG emissions that\ncome through UK-purchased imports.\nA 2020 report by the WWF stated that\n\u2018nearly half of the UK\u2019s carbon footprint\ncomes from emissions released overseas\nto satisfy UK-based consumption\u2019.\nThis is a problem for ensuring that\nemissions reporting is done accurately\nand the UK can satisfy its climate\ntargets. However, the UK Government\nsees no issue and views progress such\nas the annual CfD contracts as an\ninternational advantage. \u201cThe UK is\nalready leading the world in renewable\nenergy.\u201d Energy Minister Greg Hands\ncommented.\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement will\ntake us even further. This will help\nprovide cheaper energy to consumers,\nguaranteeing more of our energy is\nproduced at home and reducing our\ndependence on fossil fuels.\u201d\nFurthermore, while the Government\ncelebrates its apparent green-fingered\napproach to the UK\u2019s energy mix, it\nstill provides an overwhelming amount\nof financial support to the fossil fuel\nindustry. Since 2015, \u00a313.6 billion has\nbeen handed to fossil fuel companies\nin the form of subsidies, \u00a39.9 billion of\nwhich were solely made to provide tax\nrelief. On average, that is around \u00a31.9\nbillion per year. In comparison, only last\nyeardidtheGovernmentannounce\u00a3265\nmillion in subsidies for renewables\u2014to\nbe split between solar, wind, and tidal\nenergy projects.\nWhile more renewable energy\nprojects are arguably a good thing for\nending UK reliance on fossil fuels, the\nmain issue is, ultimately, trust. Can we\ntrust Government pledges to provide\neffective and equitable mitigation\nstrategies to help limit global warming\nto 1.5 degrees? Can we see a future\nwhere fossil fuels are completely off the\ntable when they\u2019re still so intimately\ntied to Government coffers? Are an\nextra seven million homes powered by\nrenewable energy worthwhile while six\nmillion extra households can\u2019t afford to\nheat themselves through winter? The\nright approach to renewable energy\ninfrastructure is not simply building\nmore offshore wind projects, it also\nneeds to include equity and fairness\nwithin every decision made.\nJack Cribb Environment Editor\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n12\nEdited by: Monami Miyamoto\nMarie Mori\nMonika Yordanova\nJack Cribb\nEnvironment View online here!\nHave an opinion on an environmental issue?
