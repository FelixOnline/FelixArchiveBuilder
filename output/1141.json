( Alongside her father, obviously). So, like any other good, pop u lar, cult TV show, it's clearly ripe for a transition to celluloid. Right?\nThankfully, the answer is yes. Put\nmost simply, if you like Rugrats the series, then you' ll like Rugrats the movie. It plays almost exactly like a standard episode, easily expanded to six times it's normal length via some good writing and judicious use of a series of cliff-hanging set pieces many of which come from the standard set of film take-offs, including Indiana Jones,\nThe Fugitive and2001. For the uninitiated, a quick recap:\nthe Rugrats in question are babies and toddlers who can talk to each other -even if they can't communicate with their parents. Leading this bunch is\nTommy Pickles, an adventurous one year-old. Also onboard is the nervous Chuckie Finster, age2;15 month twins\nPhil and Lil DeVille; and Tommy' s spoiled 3-year-old cousin, Angelica PickNot sweet by any stretch of the Imagination.\nles - the only one who can talk to the grownups. Into the group comes baby\nDylan (or Dil) Pickles, Tommy' s new and( in Tommy' s mind) unwanted little\nbrother.\nThe gang decide to return Dil to the\n\"hop-sickle\" where his parents got him. So they load up their lizard shaped buggy and sneak away from the grownups. Soon, though, the kids\nbecome lost in the woods, and their\nreal adventures begin. OK, so it's a kids film, but don't let\nthat put you off. When the revision\ngets too much, or the cries of little\nbrothers or sisters become too loud, escape to childhood, and remember how much fun it was when everything always worked out for the best.Q Chris\nWin tickets to Waking Ned with the\nKENSINGTON\nIf the advance word is to be believed,\nthen Waking Ned promises to be this\nyear's Four Weddings or Full Monty (at\nleast until Notting Hill, which is literally the\nnext Four Weddings). Thanks to the ever-generous people at the Odeon Kensington, you can win one often pairs of tickets to see this top Brit-flick, by answering this suspiciously hard question: What movie links stars from Four\nWeddings and The Full Montyl\nEmail your answers to fl lm. felix@lc.ac.uk\nbefore Thursday evening.

Please drop\ninto the Telix office ASAP to collect your\nmystery prize.\nPayback ( March26) is aMel Gibson action er that has been a very long time\nin the works. Mel plays anti he to Porter,\na man out for revenge on his double-crossing partner, in undoubtedly the\ndarkest and most violent mainstream action movie of recent years...On a happier, lighter note, Mightyjoe Young\n( March26) borrows liberally from King\nKong to produce astor v of a girl and her gorilla. It's picked up some good reviews, and the CGI is apparently amazing, so it cou id be well worth a look. Besides, it's got Charlize Theron\nin n. Plunkett & Macleane (April 2)\nlooks to combine all that's best about\nBritish cinema, in one neat lv construe ted package, combining costume?\ndrama, action, big laughs and Liv lyle r. If it's as good as the trailer suggests,\nthen it'll bean absolute must...the\nmonthly dose of teen horror comes in\nthe shape of The Faculty (April 9). It's written by Kevin Williamson and directed by Robert Rodriguez, so God knows what to expect apart from a massive body count and lots of girls in\ntight tops....and if that wasn't enough, Williamson' s busy typewriter brings us\n/ Still Know What You Did Last Summer\n(April 30) just three weeks later. A really\nsilly title, a script of the same calibre as\n/ know What You Did and a decidedly dod gy cast (Jennifer Love Hewitt and. er. Brandy out of Brandy & Monica) suggest there' s not much to get excited about...on the other hand, people have been getting excited about8 mm( April 23) ever since the project\nwas announced. Combining Nick Cage,\nAndrew Kevin Walker( who wrote Seven) and Joel Schu maker, it shouldn't be able to fail - although a story of\nsnuff movies and hard-core porn is\nhardly going to be one togo and see with your mum... and for entirely different reasons, neither is TheWaterboy\n(April 30), thanks to the kind Of wall-to-wall, lame brain, idiotic comedy that\nseems to be so much In vogue at the\nmoment. Like it or loathe it, it's made a fortune in the States, and catapulted\nAdam Sandler into the realms of mega stardom... on a more intellectual\n(read low budget)\" level, Cods And\nMonsters ( March26) has won massive\ncritical claim for its portrayal of the life\nof director James Whale and has picked up an Oscar nomination for\nstar Ian Mckellen... a cast of the hottest\nof hot young things come together for tense drama Return To Paradise\n(April 16), wher in Anne Heche tries to\nsave her boyfriend's life by persuading two of his friends togo to Malaysia and plead guilty to drugs charges,. and finally, just to make sure you' ve all got\nthe date firmly fixed In your mind( and\nyour diaries), don't forget that there'snow less than four months left until the\nrelease of Star Wars .- The Phantom\nMenace (July 19).

The loss of income was to be recovered by restricting each issue to eight pages( Felix already had advertising by this stage, and a print run of around2000). The advantage of the move, as far\nas Mr Rogers was concerned, was that\nit would allow the editorial staff to be more restrictive and critical of Felix's content, there by increasing the standard of writing.

A passionate group of students occupied the Financial Centre of UCL and refused to budge until management agreed to meet them. A week earlier (12 March) approximately 150 students had occ u pied the financial corridors bringing official business to a grinding halt. The occupiers linked arms and sat on the floor in peaceful demonstration. This\nlasted 30 hours, during which time a high court injunction was passed. The occupation ended when the bailiffs\nmade an entrance with the use of crowbars and sledgehammers, dragging students out one by one. Despite the threat\nof being thrown out of college, students\nmaintained their promise not to \"resist or\nassist\" and were carried out by the bailiffs.\nThe latest occupation was on a much smaller scale, but passions are still running high. Matt Whltecross, (3rd year\nEnglish) who took part in the occupations\nsaid; \"The way we were treated by UCL management and their hired apes was absolutely criminal.\" These two pieces of direct action have forced the manage ment of UCL into a historic concession,-the Provost, Vice Provost, Registrar and Deputy Dean have agreed to meet with\nthe students and discuss the matter face\nto face in a meeting run by the occ up ation committee. The key objective is a promise that if a student is unable to pay\ntheir debt then their education should not be affected in any way.\nOn Monday, the UCL student body are due to talk to their management directly. UCL management believes the rumours are a \"willful misinterpretation of\nuniversity policy totally untrue and without provocation\". Their actual policy\nis that undergraduates who are in debt\nshall have \"...their examination results\nwithheld and not be allowed to enter the\nnext year of study\".\nAlex Shand( second year Medic) stated \"we want to show UCL management that we are not afraid to stand up for our fellow students' ability to learn not\nability to pay\".\nLondon and in particular UCL are\nnow leading the battle against student\nfees. Both Goldsmiths and SO AS were successful in similar campaigns. Signifying that the battle is now going nation\nwide; Nottingham and Manchester universities have contacted the organisers as\nthey were \"inspired\" by UCL's action.\nAs the first wave of occupations in\ntwenty years hits UCL, the UCL union sabbaticals are all in Dallas. The action is\nnot officiated by UCL Union, resulting in\nmuch anger from the activists. The occupation committee consider the result a victory, but arc not prepared to relax\ntheir fight. It is difficult to conceive of a harmonious conclusion unless one side\nbacks down completely. In the words of\none emotional student, \"There is no com promise between them, who want to run\nthis university like a business and us,\nwho say free education is a right\"\nThe pro Rector of Imperial, Tim Clark,\ncommented,\" Our policy Is to deal with\nall matters relating to individual students\non their merits. However much we may\npersonally regret the charging of fees, we are faced with the reality that this is now the law of the land. We have been enormously Impressed by the responsible\nattitude of IC students and have done what we can to ease the problem where there is genuine hardship.\"\nFelix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB Internal tel: 58072 Internal fax: 48072 External tel & fax: 0171 594 8072 URL www.su.ic.ac.uk/Felix E mail: fell x@ lc.ac.uk\nPrinted at M CP Litho Limited, Units B2 & B3, Hatton Square, 16 -16a Baldwins Gardens, London EC1N 7RJ Felix is a registered newspaper: ISSN 1040 - 0711\nFelix is produced for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publication Board.

They're House and Garage producers with an\namazing double life: they're both Sherfield Security Officers.\nPeople have a tendency to stereotype\npeople by their appearance, the car\nthey drive, or anything else they might have an opinion on. However occasionally you get to meet people that\nchallenge these assumptions you' ve made, and encourage you to think differently. This is this situation I was faced\nwith when I met Ajay, a security guard in Sherfield.\nIt turned out that as well as keeping Imperial the fortress that it is, he leads\nan amazing double life as one half of Chilliblank, purveyors of the finest\nHouse and Garage.\" It end to take off\nmy red underpants before I come in to college!\" he jokes, as we sit in the Union with his partner in crime Dan, who also\nworks in security. It's the venue that\nthey're going to be playing at when the Carnival comes into town on Friday.\nThey played at the last Carnival, and Impressed so much that they've come back again as the only ex tern a! DJ's. \"The people I was dealing with were cowboys,\nthey were only in it for\nthe c red, because it's dangerous.\"\n\"We were on at eleven last year and we thought it was a bit early, but we got\nthere and the room was empty. We started playing a few tracks and the room filled out.\" They see this type of events as being important to the development of their music: \"It's good for us\nas we can play our stuff out and see what kind of reaction we get. It's not\nabout how you can try a guitar, or how you can sing. It's about playing the music, playing it loud and seeing what reaction you get from it.\"\nAjay got into the scene through Dan, who was already messing about on his decks at home. He did some stuff\non pirate radio stations, but wasn't impressed: \"the people I was dealing with were cowboys, they were only in It\nfor the c red, because it's dangerous.\" He therefore changed direction and looked more towards production.\" Most kids\nwere looking at Playboy\" Ajay says, \"but\nwe were looking through Future Music.\"\nThis was until one day .that they decided to get some equipment together and thing is totally faceless\" Dan observes \"if\nyou make money commercially then do it- then you can fund other personal\ntake it a bit more seriously. They sorted\nthemselves out with a bank loan, and haven't looked back since.\nThey produce their own style of House and Garage, putting their influences together to produce their own unique style: \"We're getting our own style together, it's evident in the music.\nIf we played you one of our\nearly tracks and one we' ve done now, you could see how its evolved, how much better its got. It'shaving a good knowledge of music, but also\nabout good technical ability.\" They admit\nto being quite\nearly in their\ndevelopment as an outfit:\n\"we're just\nlearning our trade. We're just putting it out as little pieces that\nwe' ve done so people can recognise\nour production talent.\" And they certainly do have talent. Despite not having put out any white labels yet, they\ninterests.\" They currently produce their\nmusic by reconstructing a track around a sampled vocal.

We want power!\" I can hear people calling. With a quick call to\nmy engineers, they were immediately rushed to find out what can be done to remedy the situation. Crime rate rising in\nSector 4? Never mind that, a police station will take care of that. Fire unchecked?\nWhat the hell are my firefighters doing?\nProbably loafing on the job again. Just\nwait till they\nhave a taste of my wrath.\nWhoever says that life as\nthe mayor of Ronnyville is a box of chocolates? Even if\nmy city is a virtual one, I quickly realized\nthat mayors are\namong the most stressed\n| people in the world. SimCity3000 (SC3K)\nlets you have a go at running a city on your\nown, the way you want it. From the very\nstart, SC3K lets you choose your own terrain from a list of famous cities, including Sydney, Hong Kong, Moscow and of course good old London. In fact, you can\nactually try to fashion your ideal London based on its geography. I Bet I could do better than the incumbent city planner,\neh?\nBuildings-wise, your city can be made as artistic as Paris - having museums and arches everywhere, or by packing it full of skyscrapers (which includes\nthe world's tallest building, the Petronas\nTowers) - claim it as your very own New York.\nAspects of city development you can\nmeddle in include transportation and power. You plan subway lines and bus\nroutes down to point where you decide\nwhere to place bus-stops. You can also\nselect the type of power generation method to be adopted by your city. As\nyour simulation runs further down the timeline, you get to build more and more advance structures like\nnuclear, solar, microwave and eventually fusion power plants. Of course, the more high-tech the energy source, the less you have to\nworry about pollution.\nTalking about pollution, one feature that is new to SC3K is the need to deal with rubbish. Sad, but it is a fact of life. Cities, even ideal ones like mine, still churn out garbage\nthat has to be disposed safely. Landfills should be avoided if possible\nsince they devalue your land and keep\ntax-paying Sims, your citizens, away. If\nyou can afford it, construct Waste-ToEnergy Incinerators. These devices effectively convert waste into energy. Cool concept!\nOf course, money makes the world goes round and you need to budget your finances well if you do not want to leave the city bankrupt and get kicked\nout of your office. Fortunately, there is a team of advisors to aid you in city plan-ning and managing taxes. They can prove remarkably valuable when your\ncity grows beyond what you can efficiently control alone. g What I particularly like about I SC3K is its disaster option. If you i feel really bored waiting for the| tax revenues to roll in - doesnt |\neveryone once in a while, try let- I ting the Sims experience the J power of nature. Earthquakes, I tornados, fire, all show nature is I particularly adept at turning even\nthe best city to an expensive art\ninstallation. One of the more \"supernatural\" disasters actually\ninvolve UFOs attacks on your\nSee that cool pool...\ncity, just like Independence Day. Though if you don't want your city reduced to\nrubble make sure your firefighting\ndepartment is on call after the attack is\nover.\nEssentially SC3K is a brilliant and highly complex game, yet designed with\nsimple interfaces to enable easy management of the many facets of city development. Indeed, it lives up to the expectations based on its highly-successful predecessor SC2K.\nNow if only they have an Armageddon comet-speeding-to-Earth disaster...\nRonny\nWarn\n..thats my cool pool that Is.\nCompetition Corner\nChampionship Manager 3 : The Final Table\nNow this one was a real bugger. Perhaps I had overestimated the football geek in ess level at Imperial..but like life, everything\nturned out all right in the end, and someone managed( sorry I punned) to get all seven ce leb fans with the correct clubs.\nThese were:1. Eddie Jordan - Coventry City 2. Nigel Kennedy - Aston Villa 3. Zoe Ball - Manchester Utd.\n4. Jasper Carrot t Birmingham City 5. Hugh Grant - Fulham 6. Jo Whiley - Northampton Town\n7. John Motson - Barnet\nThe semi-finals\nJames Martin 2 - 7 Simon Newton Peter Daplyn 5 - 7 Andrew Hilsdon\nThe final\nJames Martin 7 - 7 Andrew Hilsdon\n( Andrew Hilsdon won on penalties)\nIt's never nice to see a person lose on penalties but if James Martin wants to claim a HydrothunderT-Shirt from the office he can pick it up now. Andrew can come into the office too, but he'll have to wait until Eidos deliver the prize.\n\n"

This\nsingle, 'Bring My Family Back' is\na downbeat track with dark,\nmood driven lyrics and deep bass lines. Very deep and very\nmeaningful, showing that Faithless don't always produce thumping dance tracks. The other mixes available are completely different to the original.\nThe Paul Van Dyk Remix is a powerful progressive mix very fast, hard bass lines of high quality. The Jan Driver Mix is\nboring whilst the Rollo and Sister Bliss Mix is a deep dance ver-sion. All in all a superb single.\nOut on 12/4/99\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHardfloorVsYello\nVicious Games'\n(Platlpus)\nThis single is a fusion of two closely related music eras.\nThe modern \"dance music en vogue\" coming from Ftardfloor,\nthe older, 80's version, from Yello. The resulting collaboration is a fantastic electropop single with a very catchy tune on top of a great beat. The original version\nwas released in 1985 and was a big success. Originally an electropop track, with\nthe help of Ftardfloor and their brand of techno the single has a chance to become a truly great single.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAnother Level\n'Be Alone No More'\nAn excellent track doing the business\nin the R&B clubs at the moment. Another\nLevel are re-releasing this, their debut single with added lyrics from Jay-Z. The single also features another talked about cut\n'Girl What You Wanna Do' which features Shola Ama and again, big in the R&B clubs. Great single and worth checking out, especially if you like your R&B. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBeverley Knight\n'Made It Back'\n(Parlophone)\nUpbeat track that sits nicely in\nbetween house and garage. The tune\nisn't the most memorable I 've ever heard,\nbut at the same time it certainly isn't offensive in any way. The production is\nearned cash is three quality tracks, all\noozing with funk and a little bit of soul.\nThis LP gives you groovy beats in multi-tudes, simultaneously keeping you inter-este d, whilst still being chilled-out\nenough to relax to. If you want an idea\nof where some of this music may surface\nthen visit the Eclectronica room at Turnmills. It is there where you will, of course,\nfind tunes as diverse and as intriguing as\nthis set.\nOut 12/4/99\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nsmooth, the vocals are catchy and the tempo is lively enough for this to be used on any garage/deep house dance-floor.\nOut 22/4/99\nDanny Rose\n'Bread Into Stones EP'\n(Hard Hands)\nDanny Rose? Now I used to know a really sad Oxford DJ called the same. Surely it can't be him! An dI'd be very surprised if it was, for two very good rea-sons, firstly this is not in the slightest bit\ncheesy, and secondly it is good( some-thing that my old friend Danny sadly\nwasn't). What you get for your hard\nBoys - Just another day at the multi-storey\nD Bop\n'One Hand Clapping'\n(Fluff Records)\nWhat can I say about this? Well, a lot\nactually. This tun c came to mc just at the\nright time. It's exactly the sort of stuff that\nJohn \"00\" Fleming (a current favourite)\nwould play in one of his build-up packed\nsets. ' One Hand Clapping' has everything that you want in an uplifting house\ntrack - a healthy beat, build-ups, break-downs, a great synth melody, a bit of cheesy sampled vocals, and two stunning\nmixes on the one vinyl. My first choice\nwould be the 'jon the Dentist Mix', but\nthe 'Sunrise Mix1\non the As i dc also cuts\nthe mustard. Happy, up-beat house music with a great edge to it. Most definitely a top dog. Go out and buy this and you won't be disappointed. Out on 12/4/99\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMorgan Reno\n'When America's Wildest Animals Rescue Cops 7 EP'\n(Offshoot Records)\nAnother stupidly titled LP from Mor gan Reno, this one delivering you three\ntracks that can only be described as\n'fillers.' They are the dance single versions of the album-filler\ntracks that resign some LPs to\nmediocrity. What these tracks\nare, and should pretty much only be used for is as a set of\nloops and beats that DJs can\nplay around with whilst constructing a set. When used for\nthis purpose I have no problems with their existence, but I wouldn't go out and buy the\nrecord because of the tunes\nor melodies on it. One of the\ntracks is even called 'Chuggin',\nso that should give you a clue\nabout how this piece of house sounds like. Only buy if you are a very good aspiring DJ.\n| Out 12/4/99\nIncognito\nII 'Nights Over Egypt (Remixes)'\n(Talkln' Loud)\ncarpark\nStandard house and garage remixes of the Incognito release that I reviewed a few weeks back. This set of tracks isn't really a marked improvement or set back from the original release. In\nfact, the tracks are a bit on the average\nside, apart from the MJ Cole Dub, which would fit seamless ly into any funky garage set.\n111\nSingles by Roobarb and Gurm\n\n"

    "content": "24 March 1999 Columns 9\nPresidential Talk-Back\nhave to start with a big congratulation to all of our sportsclub s.I doubt if Imperial or anyone in London has ever done so well in a single season. Last week I attended a College committee called MAD SAC( Medical and Dental Services Advisory Committee) and a more appropriate name David Hellard,\nthere has never been. Considering the mighty power College supposedly has, I have never seen such a toothless\nattempt to push for improved student services. The issue was lunchtime opening hours and despite the seem ingly incomprehensible logic that stud ents are free at lunchtime, therefore the health centre, a service to these students, should open at lunch tim c,I was left fighting single handed, trying\nto take candy from the candy man.I was then told that students do not\neven want the health centre to be opened at lunchtimes, as only one person has ever requested It. Yet is this\nsurprising, when you consider that you either have to ask for the next available\nappointment or face two weeks ill in\nbed, waiting to see the doctor?\nUnfortunately the emails sent to\nme by students and the backing of the student rc pre ICU President sent at ive council do not counter their\nclaims. One option is a petition, but I doubt the numbers of signatures we receive will prove convincing, so in a truly Goldsmiths way our only option left is to take affirmative action; details will be revealed at a later date, but if you do want to\nsee something done for once, then please, please join us.\nI'm sorry to be a bore, but Iam not\ngoing to let this lie until something is\ndone. The case for Clay ponds has been proven and accepted, yet again no th ing is being done. So the next time you seeyour tutor, your lecturers, your wardens, the people who serve you in\nBasics or in the registry department or\neven the security lodge, ask them to\nask the Rector about Clay ponds and why their common room is not being built. Basically ask anyone you see who works in the College and maybe just one of them will be able to give a decent answer as to why the College can not pull out a measly \u00a370 000 out of their large pockets to pay for an\nessential student facility. Lven if they\ncannot answer you, it might just\nannoy them into submission. "

    "content": "34 Arts 24 March 1999\n1999 PHOTOGRAPHIC EXHIBITION\nThe Gallery, Sherfield Building\nPhotographers set themselves an impossible goal - to truthfully capture the shades, tones, moods and textures of light. Many of the photographers in this ICU Photographic Society\nexhibition come near to scoring while\nothers seem to be about as effective as\nDavid Batty taking penalties. While all\nthe photos in this exhibition are certainly\ninteresting, this does not make them art\n- true art needs some sort of spark. This\nIs the fundamental difference between simply taking a picture and making a photograph. There are so many different subjects\nand styles in this exhibition that it is\nlargely an impossible task to compare one photo to another. That said, every\nsingle one of the pictures was safely\nconservative. Disturbingly, you could hang any of them in the Rector's office\nwithout causing much of a stir (maybe\nthis was the ideal). Is noone out there\nexperimenting even with simple techniques like scoring and painting negatives or manipulating them with a computer? Holiday photographers will tell you that you need foreground interest, back-ground drama and something quirky to\nattract attention. In this sense, abstract or\nstill life photographs are difficult to do. Abstraction maybe a dangerous game for amateur photographers to play, but\nit really is essential to take that risk occasionally. While I wasn't entirely sure of the originality and the point of Kelly\nAnd rou to s poul os' monochrome images\nof human feet, at least they still remain\nin my mind. May Lee's Blue in all its shades also\nstands out. It was a dramatic panorama of misty cloud banks over mountains. This was certainly beautiful and would merit some computer enhancement to\nrealise its truly abstract potential. Indeed,\ncomputer enhancement is so widely used today by major young photographers that it surprised me to see that noone had experimented with it. If some one did use the computer, please forgive\nme for the oversight!\nAnother tenet of insightful photography is to know something about your\nsubject. In this way, Grandma and Ma by\nAki Naito worked. The photograph candidly captured a moment of intimacy\nand shared it with us. Such skill is the hallmark of a talented photographer.\nThe Old Man of S torr by Ottilie Dyke\nwas a striking monochrome depiction\nof a monumental rock tower. This could\nhave been taken by the famous Californian landscape photographer Ansell\nAdams, who died15 years ago. Adams made pictures of Yosemite and other\nnational parks and Dyke is clearly following in his pioneering footsteps. Dyke\nobviously understands that capturing grades of shadow is the key skill in dramatic black and white photography.\nI was not entirely sure why Aimee by\nLeonie Thompson( pictured) was cho sen as the winning photograph in a com petition running alongside the exhibition.\nMy winner would have been Sonu, made by Jagvinder Singh Chand ha. This was a poignant black and white shot of a young\nchild peeping over a wall, into the lens\nof the camera. In the background, we see an apparently Third World environment of rubble and poverty. This is clearly\ndocumentary art, but it is also photo journalism, dispatched from the frontline\nwith an important story to tell. I recommend you go and see this story, but\ndon't expect anything even remotely\nexperimental.\nUntil 26th March William Burns\nTROILUS AND CRESSIDA\nRoyal National Theatre, Olivier\nTroilus and Cressida is the latest production by the acclaimed Shakespeare director Trevor Nunn. This\nepic play is not to be sneezed at, and with\na length of almost four hours it is not light\nentertainment, even though at times it is\nvery comical.\nAlthough one of Shakespeare's less\nfrequently performed plays; it is regarded\nas a brilliant satire on the state, and a skilful deflation of the Greek heroes, portraying Achilles as a boastful coward and the eventual Greek victory over the Trojans as essentially dishonour able. A comedy, tragedy and history at once, since its\nfirst publication 1602 it has avoided definite categorisation.\nThe play starts during the siege of Troy, in the bitter and drawn out war over\nHelen, daughter of the god Zeus and owner of the original face that launched\na thousand ships. She has been snatched\nby the Trojans from her Greek husband\nking Menelaus and the ensuing struggle\nfor her recapture results in a war that has\ndragged on beyond all expectations.\nWe join events at the point where the\nGreeks, in their camp outside the city's walls, are becoming de moral is ed and the Trojans are beginning to question\nthe legitimacy of their stance and their\nability to endure the siege. The senselessness of a war over one woman is taking its toll.\nDespite being the namesakes of the play, the story of Cressida and Troilus is\nplayed down, while the emphasis is most\ndefinitely placed on war and its (im)moral-it y. Very little is seen of the pair falling in\nlove and no sooner do they get together\nthan she must be handed over to the Greeks. When Cressida breaks her oath\nof loyalty to Troilus, she is never really for-given, and no reconciliation (or even an\nattempt at it) is made. You arc very aware\nthat the whole play is part of a much larger picture, which can make it seem a little unresolved.\nDespite being central to the plot,\nHelen hardly appears and the single\nscene in which we sec her shows her\nalmost oblivious to the whole affair. Along with Cressida's faithlessness, and the insanity of Troilus' sister, you could be forgiven for thinking that Shakespeare was not feeling particularly sympathetic to\nwomen at the time.\nHowever, Cressida is by no means\nunthinking or unintelligent and when first handed to the Greeks she defends\nherself entirely with her wit. Sophie Ok one do's portrayal of her (pictured)\ngives her extra sass, perhaps adding a slightly incongruous air of modernity.\nDespite occasional overacting the cast were, without exception, lively and spirited and all turned in brilliant performances. They succeed in making a very\nlong and potentially very confusing story\ninteresting, and brought out the humour excellently.\nThe costumes are elaborate and, along with dramatic lighting, give a lavish\nfeel, despite the minimalist set. The\nOlivier theatre really is a lovely place, and gets the atmosphere just right.\nJ. "

So does this album give all those Prodigy fans out there a clue to their\ninfluences and inspirations? The answer Is a straightforward yes. Liam has even Included the track that provided them with the concept for Smack My Bitch Up,\nand if you didn't know already, it's the Ultramagnetic\nMc's Kool Keith Housing Things.\nThere are nine tracks in total and within each one you are taken on a journey through a mix of over five\nsongs, and Liam's mixing skills are top notch. No com plaints there. He has been a busy blok e over the last\nfew years and no offence intended but his age does show on his choice of tracks. There's a wide spread of musical styles, ranging from early '80s 'old skool' scratching with the likes of the Ultramagnetic MC's classic Give\nThe Drummer Some to the present day with Primal\nScream's excellent Kowalski. Liam also delves further\nback into the past with offerings from the Sex Pistols\nwith New York and further guitar based tracks are floating around including The Charlatans' How High and Jane's Addiction's Been Caught Stealing. Nevertheless,\nthe majority of the record is based on early hip-hop\nnumbers such as The Beastie Boys' Time To Get It and JB's Blow Your Head.\nThere is such a diverse range of musical tastes on this album, and will probably appeal to most open-minded Prodigy fans, and for the real trains potters it\nmay even encourage people to search around for old\ncopies of these tracks on vinyl.\nThe album title hints at a followup album, maybe\na different Prodigy member might try their hands at the\ndecks. Start queuing for the next one! H Jason\nURBAN SPECIES\nBlanket|\nUrban Species - it's where It's hat, kids.\nUrban Species are a three-man\nunit - M into s( the voice) and Renegade( producer) all backed up by Doctor Slim - that have received\nwide spread acclaim for their brand of intelligent rap. First signed up way back\nin 1993 by Giles Peterson's Talkin' Loud\nLabel, they were immediately releasing\nsingles that were getting praise from all\nareas of the media, DJs and even me. Their debut album Listen was a diverse set covering a wide range of musical genres, extending rap beyond its\nnormal boundaries. Their combination of live music mixed with sampled beats\nand rhymes was impressive and refresh-ing. Now after four years of a few white labels but pretty much nothing at all,\ntheir sophomore set is due for release.\nBlanket has been along time due and at last a copy of it hit the Felix door-mat. The album opens up with Changing\nOf The Guard-a thoroughly provocative\nnumber with a lovely jazzy under beat\nthat starts the album off with a little kick.\nNext up is Destructive - it starts off slow\nbut quickly picks up as the drums kick in,\nthe lyrics are hard and the chorus is a stunning double act between M into s and a beautiful female voice. As it started\nDestructive finishes as the beats are\ntaken out and a worrying ly stormy piano\nriff breaks in. Following on from Destructive is my favourite tune Blanket. It's quite simply astounding a hauntingly\ndark piece with the most electrifying\nslide action to close it out. / Wonder is a little skit that has been extended into a full track; its funky with a catchy chorus\nthat makes you want to hear it again and again.\nUrban Species take a look at life with\nevery track. None more than on the eerie Religion & Politics which is a look\nat what religion and politics really are. The\nlyrics are eye opening and the overall\nstyle is hard to categorise as one thing\nor another as they use many musical\nstyles to form a distinct album that can\nonly be described as class. EJ\nMilen\nSKUNK ANANSIE\nPost Orgasmic Chill E Pre-orgasm lc thrills all round.\nAs the album kicks off you would be mistaken to think that Skunk\nAnansie's sound has taken a more break-beat tone since their alter-native-ish Paranoid And Sunburnt. You'll\nprobably have heard the first single off the album, Charlie Big Potato - currently\nin the charts. Skin's unmistakable vocals\nare still as lavish as ever and the rhythmic guitars take a while to sting unlike\nthe radio edit which hits you straight\naway. The beats on this track last only a very short way into the album. Skunk Anansie really do make the most of the 'explicit lyrics' warning, going all out with the f words in On My Hotel\nTV. I guess they didn't appreciate the wide choice of porn channels then they appear to be very annoyed with\npeople 'Fucking on my hotel T.V./ Private\nhotel T.V.' As the album progresses, it definitely loses the beats, ending up with the\ntypical sound you would expect from Skunk Anansie. Tracy's Flaw doesn't impress in the vocal department and musically just floats along to nothing.\nThe album tries to be diverse, featuring a violin intro to Secretly and varying the tempo, but it doesn't work like\nsome of their previous releases did. They\ncan do it, but it just doesn't happen with\nPost Orgasmic Chill.\nA nice feature of this album is the\nextensive interactive element is contains.\nOf course, you need a PC or Mac with\nCD-Rom but given that you're in for a treat, it might be worth investing. There's band interview footage, the interesting\nvideo to Charlie Big Potato, a gallery of\npictures, lyrics and links to finding more stuff on the Web. El\nAsad\n\n"

    "content": "24 March 1999 FOCUS19 Just what does the future hold?\nIan Blackler examines attempts at social prediction using mathematical models, and comes to some sobering conclusions...\nThe Club of Rome\nMost of us enjoy television shows such as Star Trek, and many of us share their Utopian view of the future of human society. But just how realistic are we being?\nThe United Nations' Population Division has just\nproduced an alarming set of world population statistics.\nWhat is more, according to a group of MIT researchers\nthey show that human society is following a path to its\nown destruction.\nThe researchers were first commissioned in the1960 s, and again in the 1990s, by a shadowy organisation known as \"The Club of Rome\". Made up of statesmen, business leaders and politicians, the society's interests lay in a subject they called \"The Global Problematique.\" What they desired was a scientific, rational\nprediction of the future of mankind. The results of the first study were presented in 1972\nin the book \"The Limits to Growth\", which became an instant best seller world-wide. Its conclusions were ter-rif ying. Unless there were major changes, human civilisation would collapse before the year 2100.\nThe danger, they say, lies in the combination of several important factors. Firstly, the earth has limited\nresources, and a limited capacity to cope with human demands. Also, once people have become aware that\nthey are approaching one of the earth's limits, they take\ntime to make changes to remedy the situation.\nA good example of this is the discovery of the hole in the ozone layer. When the industrial value of CFCs\nwas discovered in the 1930s, usage swiftly became widespread, but noone understood the potential environmental impact. The dangers were eventually noted in 1974, but the 'Montreal Protocol' to limit world-wide\nCFC production was not ratified until 1984.\nThe other part of the problem stems from the phenomenon of exponential growth. This happens when something develops in such away that the more there\nis, the quicker it grows, like the money In your bank\naccount. Many aspects of human civilisation appear to\nbe growing exponentially, such as population, consumption of raw materials and energy requirements.\nHopefully, we should have plenty of warning before\nanything major goes wrong. Technology is advancing rapidly, leading to better pollution monitoring systems,\nfor example.\nIn response to these arguments, the researchers\npresented an old French riddle for schoolchildren regarding exponential growth:\n\"Suppose you own a pond, on which a water lily is\ngrowing. The lily plant doubles in size every day. If the\nplant were allowed to grow unchecked, it would cover\nthe pond completely in 30 days, completely choking off all other form s of life in the water. For along time the lily plant seems small, so you decide not to worry about\nit until it covers half the pond. On what day will that be?\nOn the twenty-ninth day. You have just one day to\nact to save your pond.\"\nIt would appear from the team's research that\nhumanity is on the \"twenty-ninth day\", and that a radical change in behaviour is necessary to avoid a total col-lapse. Technology is not enough. Modelling with System Dynamics\nThe computer models were built up using a branch\nof mathematics called 'System Dynamics'. Used in\nmaking stock market predictions and economic fore-casts, it has swiftly become a powerful tool in the business world. The modelling works essentially of the basis of feedback loops. These come in two different forms,- positive and negative. Positive feedback loops encourage a change in the system (like the lily, the bigger it is, the\nfaster it grows), whereas negative feedback loops tend\nto oppose change in the system, forcing it back to a certain value.\nPopulation Growth\nP23 o*21002003004005006007008009001000110012001300_14001500160 0 1 7 0 0 1 8 0 0 1 9 0 0 2 0 0 0 Date\nSystem dynamics combines these loops to make\nincredibly sophisticated models that have great predictive qualities.\nObviously assumptions had to be made. For exam ple, there is no difference in the program between fish\nstocks and oil reserves. The difference between the two in predictive terms is quite clear. Fish stocks can recover\n(though obviously if you kill all the fish, they aren't going\nto come back), whilst oil reserves can't( at least not on the time scales we are interested in).\nThe predictions made by the group were never\nexpected to be quantitative. It would be arrogant in the\nextreme to assume that a program that uses generalised\nparameters, such as 'resources', and assumes that the\nentire population of the planet lives in equality could\ntell you your children's average life expectancy. What\nyou can rely on, say the team, are the general trends\nshown by the simulation.\nWhen they were commissioned to repeat their\nwork in 1992, the team was able to set about the task\nwith new Information and use more complex modelling.\nWhat they found was astounding. They say that\nhumanity was not just approaching the limits of sus-ta inability, it had exceeded them in many ways. How ever, further modelling revealed that this does not\nnecessarily mean inescapable doom. What it does seem to mean, however, is that the longer we take to\nmodify our behaviour towards a sustainable society, the\nlower our quality of life will be once we attain it.\nAccording to the UN Population Division's report,\nhowever, there is as yet no sign of a decline in the rate\nof population growth. In fact, they think that the growth\nis not just exponential, but 'super-exponential'.\nWe can all hope that the researchers are wrong, but\nthis seems unlikely, since their model is based upon very\nsimple, fundamental premises. Also, the team attempted to resolve the problems that they foresaw\nby postulating more and more ludicrously optimistic sit-u at ions. They invariably failed.\nWhat can we do to prevent this dis-aster? Well, the researchers suggest a harsh but simple solution; cease all forms\nof growth. This does not means tag na tion, since technological development can still continue, but the earth cannot\ntolerate the strains imposed by a population explosion, coupled with our\nextreme profligacy.\nIt may well be that the time for indulgence is past.\nFurther Reading\nOn the Report:\n\"Beyond the Limits\",\nMeadows, Meadows& Randers,\nEarthscan Publications Ltd\nOn The Club of Rome:\n\"The Human Quality\",\nAurelio Peccei,\nPergamon Press\nPopulation Statistics:\n(Populations before 1750 and after 1998 are projections) http://www.pop in.

    "content": "12 24 March 1999\nRight Angles To Reality\nHolidays\nI knew all the words to every song on RevolverbyIhe time I was eight. When you consider that Mozart had already\nwritten an opera and half a dozen harpsichord concertos by the same age, my being able to sing along to the Beatles'\nground-breaking seventh album begins to\nlook like very small indeed. A four-year-old in Hydrabad calculates pi to thirty\nthousand decimal places, and all I can say\nin reply is \"I was alone, I took a ride, I did-n't know what I would find ther-rrr rrr r eeee\". Pathetic Isn't it? But that's me all over - delusions of adequacy. The inequalities in life are patently unfair. Why should one child turn out a mathematical\ngenius whilst all the other can do is sing\nthe descant part to Got To Get You Into\nMy Life! Eschewing the convention that\none never does reply to rhetorical ques-t ions, I will venture an explanation. It's just\na wild guess, but I would say that the hypothetical Indian boy-wonder described\nabove spent his summer vacations playing with an abacus instead of going on caravan ning holidays with my family.\nLet me take you back to the balmy\nsummer of 7 7 - Ginny had won at Wimbledon, the Queen of England was celebrating 25 years at the top and the King\nof rock and roll was mere weeks away\nfrom the most celebrated bout of terminal constipation in history. Meanwhile, in\ndeepest Bedfordshire my father was fitting\na Blaupunkt car cassette player in our Cortina in preparation for our overland trip\nto the Dordogne. It was the first time that\nwe had had a tape player in the car and my brother and I were more excited about\nit than the glorious French countryside\nthat awaited us. Unfortunately we only\npossessed three cassettes; Revolver by\nThe Beatles, Abba: The Album and Englcbert Humperclink 20 Golden Greats, to\ntake on the 1,200 mile round trip. With\nsuch a narrowness of choice, rivalling\nanything that Soviet-era Russian supermarkets didn't have to offer, I must have\nheard all three albums upwards of four\ndozen times during the journey and it is\nno coincidence that at the age of eight my\nknowledge of Lennon-McCartney lyrics\nfrom the mid-60s was unmatched by any of my classmates at the Alger Hiss Primary\nSchool. The same trip left me with the ability to give peerless renditions of Name\nofthe Game and Release Me, which was a bit spooky in one so young. Going on holiday as a child was by\nturns a frustrating and delightful bus i ness- the journey itself was a seemingly never-ending sojourn in purgatory. Not quite a' Homeward Bound'-esque \" end less stream of cigarettes and magazines\"( more a case of Sherbert Dib-Dabs and The Dandyat that age), but it was a bit of atrial for the nerves. How- \u201e\never, when the mono to/ Wall\nnous motorway drive from\nhell was over and the caravan was jacked\nup onto its little blocks of wood, and the enticing smell of roasting meat was emanating from the expertly tended barbecue\nset up outside the proudly pitched strip y awning, you could sink back into your\nreclining sun bed, sip on your pre-dinner\nVimto and feel that life was good and by\nand large it had all been worth it.\nWell, that's the John-Boy Walton Special Edition version anyway. The truth is\nsomewhat less inspiring. We would arrive\nat the site on average three hours late due to my father losing his way because my mother, who was navigating, had tried to\ndirect him down a crease in the map which she had mistaken for the B4530 or\nsome such. To his credit, my father never\nshouted at her in front of my younger\nbrother and I, rather he put on his I haven't the-slightest-idea-where-l am-but-if-l show-any-weakness-my-status-as-an-authority-figure-will-be-irreparably-dam-aged face and began to whistle with\nforced gaiety. Unfortunately the rest of us had rumbled this ploy a long time ago,\nwith the result that we knew that when Dad started to affect nonchalance, things\nhad started to go seriously wrong and It\nwas time to panic. The worse the crisis\ngot, the more devil-me-care he would become until my brother and I would be close to tears and my mother would be on the verge of a nervous breakdown.\nThis particular idiosyncrasy of my father's character only seemed to come out during our holiday expeditions and was not\nat all eased by the remarkable propensity\nthat our caravan displayed for finding\ni. every single sharp object\nor clump of broken glass\non the road, with the result\nthat we would routinely get through four\nor five tyres on an average trip.\nSomehow or other we would make it back onto the right road and my father's fixed icy grin would relax into a harassed\nfrown, which was much more what one would have expected of a man struggling to keep a Cortina Mk IV and a caravan on the road in across wind, whilst his\nkids fought over who saw the yellow\nMasarati first and alternately thumped each other and cried out for his wife to\narbitrate. Eventually we would arrive with\nmy brother and I covered in bruises and my parents arguing over who was going to get custody of \"the sodding kids\" after\nthe divorce proceedings on which they\nwould embark the minute that this \" damn holiday\" was over. The campsites at which\nwe stayed normally resembled recently\nreclaimed malarial swamps, on which someone had erected some shower/toi-let blocks which looked more like a couple of pill-boxes left over from WWII. The caravan would be parked and the awning erected after a fashion. The awning was indeed strip y, but it had been patched up more times than Grant and Tiff's marriage and as a result it leaked like a badly-fitting Pampers. When it rained, as it\ninvariably did (I 've a feeling that were we to have taken a trip to Death Valley in Ariz on a during the late '70s our arrival would have been heralded by a cloudburst), the water collected in puddles in the insufficiently taut roof of the awning making it\nsag like a Sumo wrestler's tits. Inevitably\nsomeone would flick the bulging fabric\nfrom below in an attempt to get rid of the\nrainwater and end up putting their fist\nthrough the canvas, necessitating another\nrepair.\nMy father's barbecue technique was another point of contention. According\nto The Observer's Book of Campfire Cuisine, \"sufficient time must be allowed for\nany flames to die down before grilling the\nmeat over glowing coals\". My father had\nnot read this chapter and would put the\nmeat on the griddle before the charcoal\nwas fully burned down, such that the fat\nfrom the meat would drip onto the fire,\nwith the result that our campsite neighbours would be treated to the spectacle\nof him desperately trying to bring a Piper\nAlpha scale inferno under control, and we would be left to eat something that\nresembled a cremated mole. Either this\nor he would be unable to get the barbecue to light in the force nine gale which\nwould inevitably appear, much like the\nproverbial No.22 bus when you've just lit\na cigarette, so that he would be forced to\npile on the fire lighters in a vain attempt\nto get the thing burning, with the result\nthat everything ended up tasting faintly\nof paraffin.\nAh, happy days. We shall not see their like again. At least I hope not. That's the reason that I'm regurgitating all this\nnow so that I don't forget it. For, as a well-known dictator put it, \" He who does\nnot remember history is condemned to\nrepeat it\". Megalomaniac or no mega lo maniac, he got that bit right at least. However, in the light of my lengthy and fraught holiday travels, I can't see me forcing my kids to sit for hours in a stuffy\nFord with only Revolverfot entertainment.\nBut then again - Tomorrow Never Knows.\nPRIVATE HOUSING\nThe Rush Is On to find new properties for September1999!

Pretty damn\ngood. The B side Frail is a dark, dramatic tun c, which I think's better than the A side. A close contender for single of the week.\nUltrasound - Floodlit World\nNice song, mainstream-sounding, bound to do well in\nthe charts, but nothing special. The singer's slightly sobbing vocals can annoy, but the female backing adds a nice twist. Comes with an interesting cover of The\nBeatles' Getting Befferwhich begins to make up for the\ndull title track, but not quite.\nBows - Big Wings\nSinger sounds like the one from Massive Attack. Slightly\nmore intelligent song than the other singles this week\nwith lots of interesting sounds and harmonies going on.\nNot bad.\nRoxette - Wish I Could Fly\nWell look who it is!

Ultracheesy house remix for the B side.\nMedal - Possibility\nMellow weepy song, sounding a bit like Robbie\ndL US was formed in 1991 by the lead singer and\nguitarist Tom Barman plus three other members who have since left the band. Over the\nfew years there have been a few upheavals with the\nband's line up but has now settled down to Tom, the\nonly original member left, and five others including\nthe violinist Klaas Janzoons who gives dEUS their fairly\ndistinctive sound.\nThe album opens with a track called Put The Freaks\nUp Front and staying on the abnormal theme there are\nother tracks such as Everybody's Weird. The lyrics\nthroughout the record are fairly melancholic and appear\nto tell a story, just take a listen to One Advice, Space\nwhere Tom Barman sings 'Wasted and wounded, this\nain't know way to die/one man's cold turkey is another\nman's high'. Bleak stuff indeed.\nInstant Street is the first single from The Ideal Crash\nand was released last month. It is definitely the pop pl est effort on the LP, and beautifully incorporates a laid-back acoustic guitar sound that captures the very\nessence of Americana in the verses. However when you\nget to the chorus it takes a sharp turn towards a melancholic atmosphere and the track finally ends with a discordant Status Quo-like (don't let that put you off!)\nsemi-psychedelic wash out.\nNearly all the tracks begin with this initial soft\napproach, making the use a strumming acoustic guitar,\nthen raising the tone into epic-like proportions. Just take\na listen to Sister Dew or Dream Sequence #1. .\nThere are albums that come along and at times\ntheir barrenness can be a complete turn off initially,\nhowever on this particular record your patience will be\nrewarded as the masterful beauty contained on at\nWilliams' No Regrets, but not as tuneful. Track 3 is a nice\nhip-hop style remix but it's not worth getting just for\nthat. Bad.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON Eminem - HI! My Name Is Slim Shady\nlife Fantastic! Trashy, throw away pop we all love. Great tune\nfrom rapper Eminem. With lines like T can't decide\nleast half of the record is recognised after a few listens.\nUndoubtedly there are a couple of mediocre efforts\nthrown in with the quality tracks, but these also grow\non you with further listens. For dEUS fans who liked In\nA Bar, Under The Sea I think this LP will be a great deal\nmore commercial to your cars, but even the die-hard s will eventually be converted to dEUS's more mature\nsound. The Ideal Crash is the ideal dEUS record.H Jason\nCOMPETITION TIME! which Spice girl I want to impregnate,' how can you go\nwrong? Just listen to the little comments in the back-ground. Bound to get lots of airplay. Single of the\nweek!\nLiz Horsman - Heavy High\nSoulful little ditty with some nice guitar work. A bit\n'Sheryl Crow' but I'm not going to throw it out just yet.\nThe B sides are good. She doesn't mind taking some\nrisks with the non-album tracks and it pays off.\nLuna - Superfreaky Memories\nThe usual slightly weird indie-rock from Beggar's Banquet. This has the potential to be moving, but in the\nend is a little too formulaic to be brilliant. You get the\nfeeling you've heard it somewhere before.\nAdd N to X Metal Fingers in my Body\nPretty cool electronic rock from the French crew. Sounds\nlike Air, maybe not so poppy. B sides are weird but\nentertaining in a messed up way. Very nice.\nDeadly Snakes - Culebras de Muerte\nHardcore rap on the Tommy Boy label.

However, we easily\nmade it past Greenwich to the last 16\nbeating them 71-58, only to get eliminated by Oxford Brookes, who were\neventually third in the competition.\nIn the UL Cup, after a very easy first\nround against LBS, we won two tough\nmatches against King's and against UCL\nand made it to the final. There, after a very good match we lost the Cup to LSE\n64-57.\nMen's2 nds It took us quite long to start playing\nsome decent basketball, but eventually\nIt happened. Playing in the Premier Division of the UL League against the first\nteams of the other London Colleges, we\nfought most of our matches and were\nfinally ranked fourth. In the UL Cup we\nprogressed two rounds but at the end\nfell to LSE (again...). The fact that we\nmanaged to preserve two competitive\nteams at a quite high level of competition is a great success for our club, given\nthat we are the only College in London\ncapable of doing so.\nWomen\nOur women's team faced a great\ndeal of problems this year, mainly due to\nthe lack of interest at the beginning of\nthe year and by some of the players during the year. A couple of injuries later\ncame to add to that.. The commitment\nof 5-6 girls, but mainly of Sandrine Bottinelli and Stephanie Vounou was what\nkept the team together and now it\nseems to be paying off. Finishing 6th( as\nopposed to 1st and 2nd the two previous\nyears) in the UL League is not a failure\ngiven those circumstances. In BUSA we\nmade It to the Shield where we lost to\nBristol. The very good news is that at the\nend of the year the number of players\nincreased and almost all of them will be\nat College next year. This is indeed a very\npromising young team.\nLittle by little our club has managed\nto represent Imperial in the best possible way both in ULU and in BUSA and\nthis tradition is about to be continued\nnext year because we are full of people\nwho love basketball and who love representing their College!\nSEASON REVIEW: CYCLING\nHighs and Lows\nThe past few weeks have seen mixed fortunes for the cycling club. On Sunday\n28th Feb, Tarik, Hedley and Colin took\npart in the Kingston Wheelers 14 mile\ntime trial. With opponents such as previous Tour de France yellow jersey holder\nSean Yates and current National Hill climb\nchampion Jim Henderson on the start\nsheet, the competition looked tough on\npaper. Hedley excelled himself by taking\n3 rd place, only 27 sees behind eventual\nwinner Henderson. Tarik came In 12th and Colin in 41st, with the trio missing\nout narrowly on the team prize. The following weekend saw Hedley, Tarik and\ntheir Great Britain Duathlon squad buddy\njon taking 1st,2 nd and 3rd in the Thames\nTurbo Evans Classic Duathlon, In which\ncompetitors had to run 5k, cycle 22k and run a final 3k. These races were being\nused as a build up to the BUSA team\ntime trial, BUSA MTB champs and the\nPowerman Guernsey Duathlon, which\nis the National middle distance du athlon. On the night of 11th March, however,\nthese plans were thwarted in one careless moment. Colin and Tarik were\nknocked off their bikes when a hapless\nmotorist flung open her car door as they\nwere going past at 25 mph. Tarik got up\nrelatively unscathed, with a badly\nsprained ankle and a bruised wrist. Colin\nwas less fortunate and suffered a fracture\nacross the cheek bone and a badly lacerated nose. At the time of writing, he\nremains in Kingston hospital where he Is\nundergoing surgery to pin the bones In\nplace. The driver was charged on the\nspot when the police arrived and hopefully the extensive damages will be covered by her Insurance company. All of us\nIn the cycling club wish Colin all the best\non his way to a full recovery and urge\neveryone who rides In London to bear\nthis story in mind next time they cycle\npast parked cars. DONT TRUST THE DRIVERS TO SEE YOU.\nBOAT CLUB\nLadies Head\nDown River\nSaturday 13th March was a windy, sunny\nday for the 287 crews competing in the\nWomen's Head of the River Race\nbetween Chiswick and Putney. The\ncourse is four and a quarter miles long,\nand run in reverse of the Oxford vs.\nCambridge Boat Race.\nIC had two entries with good starting positions (determined by last years\nfinishing order). The first 8 began 4th, the first crew off not to be loaded with\ninternationals, and the second 8 began\n29th. Both crews had a good row. The\nfirst 8 slipped from 4th to 10th, finishing\nahead of Cambridge but behind UL, a respectable result, though disappointing\nto have dropped 6 places. The second\n8 performed fantastically, finishing 18th and overtaking 2 crews. This is the best\nresult and IC second 8 has had for years,\nand they were unlucky not to win the\nsenior 3 pennant, coming second to a Cambridge lightweight crew.\nThese results were especially pleasing as '98-'99 is a difficult year for the\nboat club, with no 'home' as the new\nboat house is being built. Also, the year\nbegan with an inexperienced squad that\nhas come on leaps and bounds due to\nhard work, commitment and de term i nation. Congratulations to everyone who\ntook part, and good luck to the boys\nwho will competed in the Mens Head of\nthe River last week.\nRUGBY\nSurprise,surprise; IC\ncan play Rugby\nA strong confident medics side were\nwell beaten two weeks ago by a determined IC team whose skills and pace\nsurprised the home team. Within 3 minutes of the start the heavier pack had\nbeen pushed off their own ball by ICand\nthe ball was spun out for the left wing\nAndrew Mays to score an early try. Minutes later Chris Dickinson had kicked a penalty and then followed that with a try\nand conversion and the Medics never\nreally recovered.\nA try from the Medic's outside half\njust before the interval and one by the\nforwards about five minutes Into the\nsecond half brought the score to within\none point but did not dent the spirit of\nIC. Two more penalty goals and a try by\nDave Gol won the game for Imperial College.\nFerocious tackling by the visitors\nand a high penalty count for infringements in ruc ks had denied ICMS conti-nuit y. The ball was usually spilled in\ncontact when the Medics tried to use\ntheir backs and IC forwards were quicker\nto the breakdown either winning\nturnover ball or forcing their opponents\nto concede a penalty while trying to\nretain possession.\nSlick handling, pace and determined\nsupport running enabled IC to make\nthe most of their chances and to secure\na well deserved victory.\nPeterjoyce\nMOUNTAIN BIKING\nIC MTBers make their mark at BUSA\nBUSA Mountain Bike Championships\nNewnham Park, Plymouth, March 12th14 th First off, I gotta say how far we've come.\nA year on we're bigger than ever and\nthat's thanks to the people who ride\nwith us. So many jib be rs and so many\nexcuses but the hardcore are always out\non the trails.\nBike dialling took up Friday morning\nbefore we sectioned the downhill course\nand nailed all the technical stuff. The\ncourse was a real tough technical one\nwith bomb holes, steep verts, log Jumps\nand a huge pair of doubles at the finish.\nA few pedal ly traverses linked the tech-nica ls and sapped the power from your\nlegs. However it rained all night and by\nmorning the course was a quagmire.\nAfter the first round Seb was up in\nthe top 20. Scott took to cy clo cross and\nran down the course finishing up in the\ntop 30. All five IC riders finished in the top\n200 and managed to qualify for the second run. Awesome.\nThe second and final runs were all\nfaster, especially Si who lost a full 2 minutes to move within a shot of the big\nboys. Mechanicals stopped Scott and\nSeb rising up the standings any further\nHey, we were looking good after tl x first\nround and respect to everyone fot qualifying. DH is becoming a lot more seri-o us, less lard and more training and\nwe'll see IC boys stomping all over the\npodium. You gotta have a dream.\nSunday was Cross Country. Scott our\nonly serious rider In the championship\nrace. 16 miles through the mud, the guy\ndeserves a medal for Just making it\nround. However a storming first two laps\nand a solid run in to the finish brought\nhim home before five of the six Birmingham Uni lads, which is all we care\nabout. 'Nuff said.\nThanks to all the riders for a fantastic effort this weekend. We did ourselves\nproud and made a mass lye improvement on last year. Thanks to STOIC for\nthe handy cam. Thanks Coventry for letting us burn the ramp. Birmingham - we\ncaned ya.\nTom T "

It all started last friday, with\na train trip to f ough borough, where the final tournament would take place. Upon arrival, we quickly realised that this tournament was something more than 'just'\nthe BUSA finals, since representatives of the English national teams were there\nscouting for top athletes. Our team was greeted with a 'where are you from?' and 'do you actually knowhow to play volleyball in London?' type of messages. We just smiled politely. We knew they\nwould have to swallow all of that in the end. We just knew it!\nOur first match was on friday. We played Sheffield, a sports university who call themselves Sports Elite Squad( yes!,\nthat is actually what they have written on the back of their tops!). They were considered by everybody as the2 nd best\nteam in the tournament and we got the impression they didn't come to this\nmatch as well prepared as they could have done. Big mistake! IC started the game In an unstoppable fashion. Superman Carlo and Crazy Nico s were attacking powerfully, and made everybody realise we were there to win! What a display of skill! We beat them by 2-0, smiled,\nand went back to the hotel for some rest\n(more like partying actually).\nOn Saturday we played De Montford University. They were a quality side\nand had beaten in the qualifying stages\nthe current title holders. Again, we were supposed to loose this one as well. But\nguess what? We proved them wrong! A fantastic team effort, with the usual suspects Carlo and Nicos, showing every-body they were the best attackers in the tournament was enough to secure another success, this time with a21 score. With this result, we qualified automatically for the semi-finals. Hence, the result of the last match was of no importance, and some of the reserves came in\nto have some fun. We played Edinburgh,\nthe weakest team in tournament, and in\nthe end, we lost the match 1-2. But no damage was done, since 1st place in\nthe group was already secured. At the same time, we gained valuable support\nfor the3 rd day since the loud Scots were pretty grateful for the fact that we didn't play our first team and gave them a chance to fight for a result. Are we nice\npeople or what?\nfinally, on Sunday (after some wild\npartying during the night), semi-final\nagainst Cambridge. By this stage, people were already asking us when we were playing our matches since they wanted to see our players in action. We started\nbadly and lost the first set. But then, we putted on a gutsy performance and turned the match around beating the opponents by 2-11 It was a fantastic feel-ing! We were in the national final! What\nan achievement! At the same time, three\nof our players (Carlo, Nicos and Michael)\nwere invited to play for the National English University team. What an honour! The final was a big affair, with cameramen on stand-by to record the showdown, and reporters making interviews.\nOur opponents, Sheffield Hallam, were nothing less than the English School of Volleyball Excellence. These are athletes\nwho get scholarships to go into a sports\nuniversity and do nothing else but play\nvolleyball. They train daily, play in the national premiership and half of them are members of the English national\nsquad. We fought hard, very hard act u ally, and we had them scared at some stage (the crowd was actually going wild\nwith the prospect of seeing an almost\n'professional' side being beaten by a bunch of engineering students). How ever, in the end, we couldn't pull-it off and lost 0-2. Volleyball Is a team-sport and our top players could not make-up for the\nlack of high-level team-practice. At the same time, Carlo (aka Superman) had a bad injury (or was there any Kriptonite\naround?) and was not able to perform at\nhis peak (he also spent 3 days distributing autographs, which must have tired\nhim).\nWe finished in the runner-up spot,\nwith the notion that we went beyond everybody's wildest dreams. ICU Volleyball is now on the map and we'll try to\nkeep it in that way in the future. That's where we belong, fighting for the national title. We also have to thank to all\nour supporters who went along with us.\nThanks guys, you were great! And finally,\na special thanks to Ming, who played the\nwhole tournament injured, and Panos\n(Sports Personality of the Year) for his\n'professional' organisation of the whole thing. None of this would have been possible otherwise.\nSEASON REVIEW: RIFLE CLUB\nThe year started well for the Rifle and Pistol Club with an influx of keen new members who really made their impression on the club.\nThe first competition of the year was the Southern Counties Archery Competition. Three of our archers made their\nway to Brunei, and putting in a good performance to set the trend for the year\ncame away with creditable scores, one of them Leonora Lang (soon after made archery captain) coming away with the Bronze medal. Not to be out-done by the archers\nthe Rifle team got set for the West Kent\nLeague. This competition is entered by\nthe some of the very best shots in the country; the good news is some of those\npeople are in our club. An excellent performance (including a maximum100) by Andrew Eldridge saw him coming fourth overall, although this was a closer\nresult than it sounds, he was only one point away from winning, the result was decided on re-gauging!\nAs the year progressed the standard\nof shooting increased steadily, several\nshooters from IC were called up to the hallowed ranks of the UL Rifle Team, notably Sam Sharpe only in his first year\nhere. There were many fun shoots throughout the year, with ou r members going to Bisley and various Clay-Shooting\nvenues good times were had by all.\nWhile all this was going on there was always the IC league to compete in; this\nis the Clubs internal competition consisting of 34 cards to shoot. The standard\nthis year was very high, reflecting the prestigious nature of the competition. Excellent performances from Phil Golds,\nAndrew Eldridge and Sam Sharpe have\nmade it very tight; the final result is still\npending. February meant the BUSA Clay\npigeon championships, four teams from\nIC made their way to Hull and shot well\non the day having a lot of fun, positions\nin the top half of the score table for two of the teams saw them go home happy.\nMore recently Leo Lang put in a superb PB performance at the National\nRecurve Championships, winning the BUSA trials, and coming third in the head-to-head competition. This set her\nwell on the way to becoming a member of the British Student Squad.\nNo t aliens to the GB team them selves the Uf rifle team went to Sutton\nColdfield for the Inter-University Smallb ore Championships. The team contained6 out of 10 IC members and as\nsuch the result was never in doubt - yet\nanother win! The year is not over yet, however;\nthe holidays see the start of the full-bore\nseason where more Imperial victories\nare sure to be had. FENCING\nReading Novice Eppe Tournament\nDespite some hitches in the morning when one third of our three man team nearly didn't show, a glitch which would have meant disqualification and an early\nbath for Imperial, we managed to make it to the Tournament just in time to face\nthe City A team. With consummate skill\nwe saw them off with a sound thrashing\nand then proceeded to do exactly the\nsame with both Herts and Kent University, ensuring that we were seeded an unexpected but entirely gratifying seco nd. By now the smell of victory was in\nthe air, so much so that we decided to\nfor go our traditional lunch-time drink\njust in case our fencing skills were impaired.\nRested, we entered the direct elimination round and quickly dispatched the City A team which pitched us up against Hull A in the quarter-finals.\nDespite their initial appearances Hull\nproved no match for our combined efforts and we found ourselves in the semi-finals. This was against Exeter and turned out to be our first tough match.\nWe found ourselves trailing half way,\nhowever thanks to some aggressive scare tactics from John 'needs a box' Lung we managed to even the score.\nThis was followed up by some classy\ntiming and a few choice moves by Alex\n' One pint will hurt' Griffin meaning that\nwe entered the last fight in the lead. All\nthat was required was the deadly patience and pin-point accuracy of John\n'foreplay' Claeys to beat Exeter 45-42.\nThe final then was Imperial vs the Keele\nA team who had won the foil the previous day. The match started well with\nour team managing to keep level, ho wever by now we were tiring and Keele\njust seemed to have the edge, despite\na last spurt by 'Foreplay' we lost 41-45\nand just had to settle for silver.\nThe whole event was. very entertaining and we returned home and to\nthe pub clutching our medals with pride.\nAnyone interested in fencing should\ngo along to the union gym at lunchtimes\non Monday or Friday.\n\n"

    "content": "30 /\n^JX^> Music 24 March 1999\nL ast years Rae & Christian album\nNorthern Sulphuric Soul was high\non my list when It came to choosing my favourite albums of the year, so\nnaturally I leapt at the chance of Interviewing band frontman Mark Rae.\nFor those of you who haven't heard\nof Rae & Christian, their music could be\ndescribed as hip-hop with more than\nJust a hint of soul added to spice up the\nsounds. With guest vocalists on their\nalbum as diverse as the Jungle Brothers\nand Sharleen from Texas, the music produced never fails to Impress.\nAs well as being a key member of\nthe band, Mark Rae Is also head of Man chester's Grand Central record label.\nWhen we met he had just come back\nfrom a tour of Australia. Tired, he started\nwith a yawn, but Mark Rae Is definitely\nnot one to complain.\nFelix: So how was1998 for you then?\nMark Rae : Amazing. The highlight was definitely the album. Producing the album was a really organic ex peri Jen ce. We just did the music, and f then thought about what would I sound good with what. It was all very |\nsimple - everything we did worked, j Of course there were things we; would have liked better in both the( music and the singing and the| i rhyming and everything. But we just j kept with it. As long as we were ji\nenjoying it, we just kept going for- (\nward.\nF: So what do you prefer Manchester or\nLondon?\nMR:I love them both really. I suppose London is not really my kettle of fish as\na place to live, but it's a very interesting\nplace to be in and around. Although I 've\nlived in Manchester for twelve\nyears now, cities aren't really my\nkind of thing I like the country-side, fishing, and stuff like that\ntoo much. I'm from Northumbria originally. F: So what lead you down to Manche ster then?\nMR:I first went down to Manchester to\nstudy. I did an undergraduate degree in\npsychology and then a postgraduate course in philosophy of science. Although not much to do with music\nanything to do with study is useful for\nyour brain as it teaches you how to be\ncontrolled, self disciplined and all that,\neven if you never work in that field again.\nthe Stone Roses, but at the time I was just\ndoing my own thing. Manchester was a very vibrant place at the time, and I suppose it always will be. It's quite dark and dreary, but it's very funky with loads of young people and stuff.\n've dedicated the last ten years of my life to It to the\npoint that music is now my life and I love It.\"\nF: And before we finish the interview I'd like your answers on a two cheesy A or\nB questions. First of all, Billie or Britney?\nMR:I 've got respect for Billie at her age dissing her own music and going on about it. She's made a very big mistake,\nbut at least it shows she's got a mind of her own. Britney is however quite sexy, but in a horrible\ndressed up as a school kid kind of\nChristian, few* Tel* 1Z F: As well as the music on your own label\nwhat other music do you listen to?\nMR: Well I 've never been into the UK hip-hop scene, I think it got as far as it could then people just did jungle instead. The\nAmerican hip-hop scene's pretty crap at\nthe moment, apart from the underground scene. But I'm also into anything\nfrom the Cardigans and the Manic Street\nPreachers to reggae and dub, I also like\nDetroit techno I 've got it all in my col-lect ion. I'm thirty years old and I 've been DJing from before house music, so anytime I 've got tired of being into som thing I 've learned to go to another type\n~] of music. One thing about music\nis that you' d be surprised how| j some songs that at first sound P ordinary, but if you' ve had an\nH experience while listening to\n| | them they can become spiritually\n|lan the mic to you F: How long have you been playing \u00a7\nin the music industry?\nMR: I suppose I 've dedicated the last g ten years of my life to it to the point \u2022\nthat music is now my life and I love it. At\nGrand Central we're not just artists waiting to get signed by majors, we' ve got a really strong base; a record shop, a publishing company, a record label, a licensing record label, offices. People may only\nknow us from this first album, but we' ve set a base and we're going to prove a lot\nof people wrong about our longevity -we'll be around for years.\nson\nF: What did you do after finishing at uni-vers it y, have you got any advice for the undecided? MR : Well I'd been DJing since I was about eighteen, and was really into\nmusic so I started my own record shop. I was into soul, hip-hop, Skooly D, early\nPublic Enemy - a lot of what's called old school these days. I was also into the Jungle Brothers the first time round, and it therefore really good to work with\nthem on the album. They gave us a really\nold school sounding rhyme.\nF: You talk about longevity, and Is up pose this is all linked in to diversifying and never doing the same thing twice.\nMR: Yeah, we do a lot of different things from remixing others \" ...Britney Is howe vet quite sexy, but in a to making our own records. I'm horrible dressed up as a school kid kind of way...\"\nalso doing a lot'of executive production for the artists on Grand Central.\nWe've got an album coming out from Aim, which I'm doing. It's going to be really cool and funky, probably better r than Northern Sulphuric Soul. We also do a bit of DJing and have residencies in\nManchester and in London at The End.\nF: Being in Manchester though you must\nhave been into the Happy Mondays, Stone Roses and all that?\nMR: Not really. I was just obsessed with\nthe black music culture of America and all that was going on around meI just\nsort of ignored. Looking back, Ido like\nj F: You've got to remix quite a I number of famous acts, in clu dI ing, a great record with Texas,\njI low do you( eel about making a I remix so good were the Wu-Tang\n.\u2022 riled?\nJ MR: Yeah I know. We'd worked g with them before and Sharleen\nwim w j has got a great voice, they're\nalso great people to work with, and I think our music and her voice works well, so yeah it's cool. We try to never\nrush things, and try to ensure everything\nwe do has a real quality to it.\nF: So where are R&C and the Grand Central Label going from here?\nMR: We' ve got\na remix to do for the new Hurricane#1 single, and the Aim album that\nshould be out\nsoon. We're also looking forward to doing another\nR&C album, but\nwe won't rush\nanything.\nway.\nF: Ok then, as it'san issue that's raging\nin all corners, who' s going to win the Fat\nBoy Slim or Armand van Helden battle?\nMR: Well Fat Boy Slim is quite a wiry sort\nof lower middle weight boxer, but he\nsmokes loads and cain s it while van Helden doesn't. So Helden will probably\nknock his brains out. Norman probably\ncould have been a good boxer if he\nkept himself fit, but Hcl den should be\ncareful as some these wiry lads are dead good at boxing.\nF: Finally, looking for some ideas myself\nwhat you doing for the millennium?\nMR: Well we might end up in Australia\nbecause the fan base over there is a maz ing. It might be nice to do that, but to\nbe honest with you I just want to be with\nmy family, and even if I was in a club I'd want my family to be there with mc. It\nwould probably be best to go and stand\non a hill with your family and hug. That\nwould be brilliant.\nSo my chat with Mark Rae showed\nhow It Is possible to make It big and keep\nyour feet planted right on the ground.\nRather than the music though, the thing\nthat stayed with me the most. Is that he\nwent from postgraduate study to running\na record shop. A story which must give\nhope to those final year students experiencing not the most pleasant time In\nthe Job market at the moment...\nJames\nWm Christian. featuring \"Dexm Mi 'HE-*T Mark Rae (left) with Steve Christian:\nHe may prefer Britney to Billie, but at\nleast he know's Helden's got the\nedge on Slim.\n1\nSULPHURIC SO I OX Mark Rae (left) with Steve Christian:\nHe may prefer Britney to Billie, but at\nleast he know's Helden's got the\nedge on Slim.\n*i*',s*N^^ "

    "content": "24 March 1999 Arts 33\nJACKSON POLLOCK\nTate Gallery\nJ|ackson Pollock' s frenzied paintings are a feast for disturbed minds and overactive imaginations. When ou squint and stare at his animated swirls, the intricate patterns reveal a myriad of impressions. Whether or not you grasp his intended concept( if indeed one exists), each observer invariably forges his own instinctive, original interpretation. Critics revel in psycho analysing his troubled personal life, marred by self-destructive bouts of depression, woman ising and alcoholism. His untimely death whilst drunk often leads them to speculate furiously about the eventual course of modern art history had he survived the tragic\ncar crash, which undoubtedly fuelled his icon status. Pollock<19121956) was born in Cody, Wyoming( a town named after the legendary Buffalo Bill) and his career regarded as an unconventional cowboy artist -thrived. His radical, revolutionary techniques launched the Abstract Expressionist movement of the mid twentieth century. This major retrospective, organised by the Museum of Mode rm Art\nin New York, is particularly fascinating and insightful because it traces the evolution of his work from humble student imitator to virtuoso innovator, from figurative realism and myth o logical imagery to suggestive abstraction. He disputed accusations that\nhis approach was random. In fact,\n\" he denied the accident\" and defied the horrified housewives of his time, who claimed that any kindergartener could do the same. Rather, his source was the unconscious. His eloquent work has even been described as the visual equivalent of jazz improvisations. During the late 1940s, Pollock disc ard ed the conventional brush and laid his canvas down on the studio MYRIAM MAKEBA\nRoyal Festival Hall\nMyr iam Makeba, known as\" Mama Africa\", is the most respected living African singer because of her involvement in\nanti Apartheid movements and her efforts for women's liberation. Her career has spanned over 40 years and she is still as popular today as she was in the60 s. Her music is a mixture of typical South African sounds, with some xhosa a very guttural African language singing. She adds a jazzy and soul feeling to her songs. The concert started on time( something to shout about for a world music gig) and the minutes he walked onstage, she won the audience's heart. Most of the people present were fans and she virtually received a standing ovation before even opening her mouth. Then the magic began. She literally ripped the air - she has one of the strongest voices I have ever heard. The songs succeeded one another with tremendous ease and she entertained the audience wonderfully. She kept on chatting between numbers. She was touchingly funny and constantly sassy. Her musicians were from all over Africa. She gave them all the time to show their identity they all introduced something from their own background and upbringing. This gave the concert an even more international and humane touch. She performed a mixture of her old beloved songs that everyone sanga long to and some new material\nfrom her forthcoming album. It is\namazing that at 67, Makeba is still on top form and continues to reinvent herself.\nAfter a short well deserved inter-val, the artists returned to offer usa fantastic second half. The rhythms got faster and the musicians became more involved. The audience was very\nresponsive to this and many people stood up and danced. Makeba let all\nher musicians do stunning solos; they were all very talented, especially the American saxophonist who was simply breathtaking throughout. She then showed off her backing singers, including one of her granddaughters whose voice approached her cider's.' You could see that the artists were having a great time on stage. They were dancing and joking with one floor, creating his pivotal Great Webs\nsequence. This radical' action paint-ing' the application of paint by pour-ing, splattering, trailing and basting earned him the humorous nickname of 'Jack the Dripper'. He also experimented further with this basic method by using enamel or aluminium paints, adding s and to enhance the texture and embedding various diminutive objects in his composition.\" Concerned with the rhythms of nature\" and the\" expression of contemporary aims\", Jackson Pollock is\nan inspirational, if somewhat disturbed, tortured and intangible, fig-ure. During a period of emotional crisis, his typically vivid and dynamic canvasses arc suddenly replaced by haunting series of monochrome net-works,\" nightmarish visions of doomsday aspect\". The monumental scale of his mature designs is at once intimidating and breathtaking; vibrant\nand glorious in the flesh, they must be seen to be believed and entirely appreciated. Well worth a visit during the holidays. Helena\nUntil 6th June\nNearest tube: Pimlico\nOpening hours: daily 10am5.40 pm Admission: \u00a37.50, concessions \u00a35\nanother. It really made my day.\nIn shor t, this kind of concert is\nwhat any music lover dreams of. All\nthe ingredients were there to make it\nan unforgettable night: genius, laugh ter and emotion. Makeba had n't been in London for years and was very touched to be back in the country that, in her own words, has helped South Africa so much. Hopefully she won't leave it so long until her next\nappearance. World music very is rarely covered in mainstream press. It is time to do something about this because there is\namazing talent around and the music that is being created is very daring and interesting. Please support these musicians. They will open your hori-zon s and provide you with brilliant\nentertainment. D. "

    "content": "24 March 1999 Clubscene ^ftm^ 25\nAlbums\nAlbum of the Week\nJohn Avery\n'Once I Had It All, Now I Just Have Everything'\n(Liquid Records)\nSome albums are weird and not wonderful. In fact, most of these so called 'experimental' albums are a load\nof bollocks and a waste of money. But\nthis album by John Avery is weird, wonderful and of high quality - it's a very\n'Future Sound of London' type album. There are tracks which sound like they\nshould be on the soundtrack of some scifi movie such as ' Op timo City' whilst others are more funky and downbeat such\nas the title track. Yet still, tracks such as\n'Blipvert' and 'The Night the Rain\nStopped' are eclectic. It's a fantastic\nalbum, fusing many different sounds and crossing many genres, sometimes creating a haunting atmosphere and sometimes a down-beat chilled sound, and you don't know what the next track\nwill sound like making it very unpredictable. All the tracks have been writ-ten, performed and produced by John\nAvery and he's taken time to produce a quality album. It's good to see( or rather\nhear) someone taking time to produce good quality experimental sounds without making at wat of themselves.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFlex 13\n'Paint My Legs'\n(Liquid Records)\nSimilar to the John Avery album which is not surprising since it's also on Liquid Records. Again, a very experimental album with a range of music,\nfrom down-beat and funky to industrial\nand eclectic such as 'Burning Arms', and in the case of 'Schizophrenic Lover' a jazz\ntrack with a hint of country music whilst\n'Give Me Wings' provides a slow groove\ntune. Musically very open minded and very experimental, it is different to the Avery album, but doesn't have the same edge. Worth listening to at the record\nstore before buying, though I prefer the John Avery album. Strange but good. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nVengaboys\nThe Party Album'\nEveryone's heard their first two singles 'Up and Down' and 'We like to Party'.\nCheesy and irritating dance singles that\nteenagers up and down the country\nbought and sent the fucking things to\nthe top of the national charts. Now the Vengaboys inflict their album on us. The\nrather sadly titled The Party Album' is, surprise surprise, complete and utter crap.\nAll the tunes sound exactly the same and it would be a brave person who managed to listen to the whole thing\nfrom start to finish. Very commercial, very Euro-house, very teeny-bopper\nsounding I'm sure you get the picture.\nI guess if someone out there likes the\nVenga boys then check the album out,\notherwise avoid like the plague.\n\u2022\nAlbums by Gur m Catalogue Records Special\nAvla\n'Avia EP'\n(Catalogue)\nThis is another album from a top Frenchman, Pierre Avia. That part of the world has really been getting it's act\ntogether recently. This EP combines the best elements of some truly chilled-out\njazz and some great breakbeat s too. The\nfirst track has been described as \"float y house\" -1 am not quite sure what that\nmeans but it certainly had me chilling.\nGreat jazz beats and trip py keyboards on this one. 'Rebirth' is next, with more of the\nsame bliss ed out keyboards and a great\nsample with a guy relating his ills to the\nworld, when suddenly a great Africanstyle beat whips in. It really gave me a start the first time I played it! The drummer on this track, artificial or not, is very\nskilled. As soon as the drums jump in,\nthey jump out, to be replaced by some funky guitar action, then they all come back together. Not fast enough for mc, but a good track for chilling out to\nnonetheless. The next track 'Exil Exit' has some nice Neil Armstrong samples and more great drum breaks. As\nfar as Iam concerned any song which uses\nspacey samples gets\nthe thumbs up! The final tune on this great EP is\n'Flash/Flashback' - this\nlittle tyke managed to\nconvince me that my CD player had broken. You see it starts with a cunning loop of thu nder and a piano sample1 was sure the it was trashed. But sure enough after a while a wicked jung li sh beat slams in. All\nin all a great EP for chilling with. Good work Pierre!\nOut April 1999\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nTele pop musik Tele pop musik EP'\n(Catalogue)\nAnother bunch of Parisians made this EP - a trio of producers making their\nCatalogue records debut. These guys\nmust have picked up a church organ on the cheap or something, because il is\nfeatured heavily in this EP, and to great\neffect admittedly.\nTrack one, 'An Ordinary Life' starts off\nwith a scary sample from some book which I can't quite remember. It's quite\ndark - with great Indian drums helping to\nset the mood. It builds up to a crescendo\nof beats and then breaks out into boom'ing organ. Groovy.\nNext up is ' Something About G.A.' Starts off with some guy, who appears to\ncatalogue be having a very weird conversation with\nan information line operator for something called G.A. we never find out\nwhat this illusive G.A. is. Still, who cares\n- with beats as large as this the conversation doesn't matter. It all goes very\nmental very quickly with rapid drums\nand some wie rd little girl samples. Nuts.\nMoving on to' Something Else (G.A. Remix)' this is an Indian twist on an\nalready funky tun c. Great percussion -and that insane little girl again. I think I prefer the remix to the original - it's a little bit more up beat and cheery and there is nothing wrong with that, now is\nthere?\nAnd finally...with Track 4 'A Life Less\nOrdinary( Remix)' the beats just get\nfaster. Very Prodigy sounding this one with sirens, chopped beats, and808 s. Wicked. More good work from Ihe con-tin ent. Out May 1999\n* \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 P Catalogue Records Special by Joel\n\n"

    "content": "14 Games 24 March 1999\nViva Football (PSX)\nVirgin Interactive\nFootball, football, football. For some crazy\nreason it seems that all I have been reviewing for the last few weeks are football management or football playing\ngames, or even running football related\ncompetitions. After all this football you would think that the next football game to come along would meet a very jaded reviewer and be placed in the bin at the first fault.\nThis being true I tried really hard to hate Viva\nFootball\nfrom the kick off and totally failed.\nThis is a football\ngame that\nfinally has a serious go at the EA\nfifi a( well it\nseems like a mafia organ-is ation) and comes off the\nwinner on the Playstation.\nI 'll repeat that, this game is\nbetter than Act u a Soccer,\na more sensible option than Sensible Soccer, kicks\nthe youngster Mr Owen into the stands and it\nmeets and beats FIFA '99\nin extra time.\nLook at the screen shots, well these are the quality graphics that you get, and they dont just look good when still. The animation of the players is both\nsmooth and fast. This has been possible\nmainly because of the camera angle used. Some will find it a little far away\nfrom the action but most will find it just\nthe right distance to be able to plan\nthose pin point passes and crosses. If\nthere is a complaint it can only be of the speed of the game. For the beginner it\nwhizzes about just a little bit too quickly,\nthough stick\nwith it and i soon the force (of the pass) will be\nwith you sorry I 'll do no more Star\nWars refer-en ces 'till\nJuly.\nWhat I can't show you on the screen is the almost perfect sound. The pitch shook with\nsound coming from the stands and the occasional referee\ncomment. Even the lack of a commentary on this 9 8 % complete version did not detract\nfrom the other sound also while the comment ry is nice it does start to grind when Barry comments for the twentieth time\nthat he could not hit that with a banjo.\nThe current trend in these games is\nto include even more stadia (300 in this\none), even more teams(1035 they\nmight have your local pub team, complete with the short fat one who plays in\ngoal and hits anyone who comes near)\n. There is also the quota of historical\ngames with teams as far back as 1958 to\nbe picked, so its time to dust down the1990 England\nand Germ any teams and this\ntime make sure it\ndoesnt\nget any-where near\npenalties, if you really want to avenge\ninjustice you could try the 1986 world cup\nfinals and make sure Mara donna fails to\nstay on the pitch for long.\nThis game is good, the control and\ngameplay give you total control, and even if it is not as easy to pick up as other\nsystems it rewards you with much more\nfluid football - either that or the long\nball game becomes the tactic of choice.\nThe graphics and sound are excellent,\nthe crowd will start\njeering if you start\nplaying too many\nwild balls.\nVirgin Ineractive are on to a winner. EA are\ngoing to have to\no ok deep and hard and finally\nhave a game of\ncatchup on their\nhands.\nEaster News : Bunnies not included\nEidos : Cheap Cheap Games\nEidos are adding five new titles to their\nPremier Budget games range. All for the PC and priced at \u00a312.99 at all good stores\nthe range now includes:-Fighting Force where you save the world as one of four heroes, fighting\nthrough seven levels.\nIan Livingstone's Deathtrap Dun geon; Tomb raider meets Dungeons and Dragons.\nFlight Unlimited2; come fly with\nthem over land and hopefully not into\ndale.\nAct u a Golf 2, reviewed last year and features eight courses in which you can\nplay in the sand, the water or if you are\nperverse enough even attempt to get\nthe ball in the hole.\nAct u a Soccer 2, with live comment ry from Barry Davis. It also used Michael Owen as the motion capture monkey. Look out for reviews next month. N2000 - not till 2001\nNintendo look like holding back the launch of the N2000, the Nintendo128 bit processor based games console till\n2001.\nAparently the system has been given\nan amber light and the system has not\nbeen finalised. Several factors such as\nhow well N64 titles such as Perfect Dark\nand Donkey Kong64 do, as well as how sucessful the Playstation 2 is will effect\nnot only the systems capability but also\nits launch date.\nThe un finalised details specify a poly-gon engine capable of handling20 million raw polygons per second, but the biggest shock is the lack of a cartridge\nsystem. Nintendo have realised that it\nwas this that killed mass software development which meant that few people bought it. Hurrah for the learning experience. Blender Book\nAnd finally something a little bit more\nserious. For all those who mess about\nwith 3-D rendering now surely thats a few of us out there, there is a new beginners book by Ton Roosendaal. Blender\nv1.5 manual. For all those not in the know Blender\nis a really useful 3-D tool. I 've used it on the Mac and also on a linux box. Its a little bit complex as you would expect\nfrom a useful tool but as soon as you get\nthe hang of it you can produce some quite stunning3 D effects.\nAs well as being a beginners book it also manages to double as a reference.\nQuite handy as after you have mastered\nthe basics you go away for a couple of\nmonths and come back finding you have\nforgotten most of what you spent long\nhours learning.\n\n"

Last week of term and once its over we got time to mess about with\nrevision for those all important exams,\nbut ya gonna listen to while you're study-ing? I'm gonna tell you! After interviewing Beverley knight I feel\nthat I have to big up her latest offering\nthe reworking of ' Made It Back', but\nthere is no need to big it up for the sake\nof it this is really good, although I prefer the original this will probably do more damage on the charts. There's a slight\nchange to the feel, making it more of a old school soul feel to it.\nThe three lovely ladies TLC are up next\nwith their massive hit 'No Scrubs' this has\nbeen about for a while and is wicked. Its\nbeen released on a two CD set, the first\nof which has two mixes of' No Scrubs',\nboth of which are good and the album track 'Silly Hos' which is brilliant as well.\nThe second CD has 'No...' as well as two classics from their previous album 'Creep'\nand number one 'Waterfalls'.\nTalking about lovely ladies we on the\noriginal silly ho the R&B diva Mariah as\nshe releases one of the previously unreleased tracks from her 'No. Is' album, namely 'I Still Believe'. This is not that\ngreat as a tune, its solid, but not outs tan ding and quite simply doesn't deserve a mention in this page, but we need some excuse to put the picture in so here it is.\nFinally\nBlackstreet are legitimately\nhailed as one of the R&B supergroups and their\nnew release has been eagerly anticipated\nsince we all earned\nthey were in the\nstudio working on\nit. 'Finally docs not disappoint in\nthe least it fol-lows the standard pattern laid\nout by the swing-beat innovator\nf eddy 'Street'\nRiley...that pat-tern..absolute class\nat every level.

After the stupendous 'Another Level' they had\nthe record company ordering\nthem to\n\u00bb' make Me she Is\nthe latest In along line of young brit l sh r&b divas to\nappear on the scene. Her debut single is due out soon, and only time will tell If she can make In the big bad world. another' No Diggity' but rather than that, as Chauncey\n'Black' Hannibal said \"No, lets be different again, like we were with No Diggity.\nfet s not go by those record industry\nsales. Lets make some new ones up.\"\nOn the first listen to 'Finally' its clear that\nthe same swing beat flav a is there but\nthe differences arc there to be heard.\nBlackstreet have taken it to the next\nlevel. The first single off the album is\nalready doing the rounds and is blowing up big time, a collaboration with lus-cio us Janet Jackson called\n'Girlfriend/Boyfriend'. This destined to\nbe a club classic. On 'Can You Feel Me' Teddy has sampled the Jackson Five tun c of the same name with some phat\npyrotechnic beats, they rip it with a real\nparty tune. The only drawback is that it\nis so reminiscent of awful Tampara 'Chim-ney' song which also samples that Jackson Five tune. Also included (probably\njust to sell the album) is the Rugrats tune\n'Take Me There', not the original version\nthough, the remix which uses another\nJackson Five sample. This new version is\na extremely funky, but doesn't have the\nsame quirk i ness of\nthe original.\nThe voc oder is\nback in full effect, its\nbecome Teddy's trade-mark, and is used to wonderful\npurpose in Yo Love' which is an up\ntempo that rocks in a similar way to\n'Don't Leave Me', but is a bit more upbeat.\nFlipping on to the down low side I have\nto mention my favourite track the beautifully sultry duet between the Blackstreet\nboys and the amazing Mary J Bligc. The\ntune is easily the standout as far as Iam concerned, the actual words arc shit,\nbut the melody is phenomenal, its great\nand you got check it out. You also gotta\ncheck out the funky slowed down 'Think\nAbout You' which is Blackstreet at their\nbest, awesome harmonies backed with\nthe usually pha i bass lines. Lets not forget the sweeping ballad 'In A Rush' a collaboration with the daddy of soul the\nnumber one geezer Stevie Wonder.\nI could goon and on about the quality\non this album, I haven't even mentioned the bassey beat laden 'Don't Stop1\nor\nthe beautiful 'Black and White', but you\nget the idea.

Flood Fest\nThe Great Waffle Sale\nBy Emma Watson\nIn the early hours of Friday 12 March, as the sun was rising, so was the temp ting smell of waffles. All set and ready\nto go with the waffle maker and approximately 12 litres (20 kilos) of waffle mix, the day got off to a brilliant start\nas students and other locals' decided to breakfast in style. And what better\nway to do so than with hot waffles dripping with calorific toppings under London's amazingly blue skies. Indeed,\nthe sun was out and everything seemed set for a prosperous day ahead. Or so I thought. Lunch tl me brought a rush of starving students and round-eyed children. Sounds great for sales but unfortunately it decided to rain. Tension was growing. Stomachs were rumbling. But true to all happy ending stories, the rain disappeared as\nsuddenly as it had started, and the day\nturned out to be the sunniest and warmest London had seen in 1999.\nAnd best of all, the waffle-maker lasted\nthe day without exploding with over-work! The profits from the day were amazing together with the profits of a three-day sponsored silence I did the week before, a total of \u00a3510 was raised.\nBut I must not take all the credit on this\none as \u00a360 was raised on Red Nose Day\nby Richard, who had his beard dyed red, Lucy, who did the dyeing, NiroJ\nwho turned up dressed in red from head to toe and Ajay, who collected the money. To end this sticky saga, I would like\nto thank all of you who pigged out for\nComic Relief and of course to those of you who donated money. By Sunil Rao\nStudents and staff in the Huxley Building\nand the Blackett Laboratory were shocked to find, just after 3 pm on Wednesday10 March, water flooding from a burst water pipe. Estates were, however, on to the problem within minutes of being alerted at 3:06pm by a security guard from the11 th floor of the Blackett Laboratory, and the flood was stopped within twenty minutes. How ever, water had poured into a stairwell\nand lift shaft, putting the lifts out of action for over twenty-four hours.\nAccording to Dave Morey, Senior\nSupervisor (Mechanical) in Estates, the flooding was caused by a freak pressure\njoint burst. Describing the plumbing as\nbeing \"very old\", he said the problem was fixed in a \"very short while\". Cle a ning up the mess afterwards took significantly longer, nearly three or four hours,\nas \"all the rooms were wet\". Mr Morey was very appreciative of those based in\nthe affected areas, saying they were \"very good\" in helping them in the clear-ing-up process.\nThe direct effects of the flooding were felt at least three floors down, with members of staff in the Departm ent of Computing on level 3 of the Huxley Building being advised not to\nleave their computers turned on overnight. Everyone affected was generally appreciative of the staff from Estates who moved in quickly to sort the\nproblem out, praising their timeliness\nand efficiency.\nP em bridge Gardens suffered a similar fate as Huxley on Sunday 14 March. Hall wardens were first alerted to a problem by a fire alarm at midday. After an\nevacuation, the cause was later traced\nto one of the common areas.\nApart from significant flooding burst\npipes had caused part of the roof to\ncave in. Reparative action was commenced last week. \u2014 I mm ml ll m^^m ill is Photo: Jonas MISSING: One Celling, slightly soggy\nLondon Marathon\nBy the Newsteam\nIC PhD Student U to miO do zi is running the Flora London Marathon on18 April\n1999 to raise essential funds for Oxfam's work with poor people, many of whom have had their homes destroyed by war.\nOn the day U to mi will join a team of75 Oxfam runners all dedicated to doing their personal best for some of the world's poorest people.

    "content": "24 March 1999 Books 35\nTHE WHOLE WOMAN\nby Germaine Greer\nGermaine Greer is famous all over\nthe world for one book, The\nFemale Eunuch. It was written 30\nyears ago and was a defining moment in\nthe first steps of Feminism. Since then she\nhas continued writing and teaching in\nseveral universities, although she is now based at Warwick University.\nGreer has come to the conclusion\nthat it is time to get angry again. She doesn't think that Feminism has answered all the questions and solved all\nthe problems. She therefore decided to write a new book, The Whole Woman. It\ntakes on a tremendous amount of topics,\n\"women take all\nthe blame and\nhave no control\"\nranging from women's bodies to their\nrelationships with men, children and par-ents. The book is terribly interesting and has a strong energy about it. The promotion of the book may appear very\nmass orientated. Greer has done this\ndeliberately - she has said herself that\nthere Is no other way to do it in this time\nand age.\nOn Tuesday16 March, Germaine Greer appeared at the Royal Geo graph ical Society to talk about her book and her\nideas in general. The audience was mainly composed of women, with the odd man here and there. After being introduced, Greer started talking - it was captivating. She is a natural speaker and seems very used to it. Her eloquence was inspiring and her intelligence just\nradiated. She began by mentioning some-on women's feelings towards their own bodies. She then moved on to general is e about how women are made to live in\nfear by clever marketing strategies and thing that is very close to her heart - the way women have been reacting to breast\ncancer and the lack of proper screening\nfor it. She also made general comments how they \"take all the blame and have no control\". Her arguments were very convincing and she is a pleasure to listen to.\nHer short talk (only half an hour) was followed by a question and answer session.\nThis was even more compelling since\nsome people were trying to catch her out\nand were asking very difficult things. But\nshe was ready for it and her natural flow\nwas even more impressive. The exchange\nwas very fruitful and included comments about transsexuals and disabled individuals as well as major issues that she raises\nin her book. Greer showed that she was indeed angry and that things had not\nchanged all that much since the60 s but\nshe did warn women that they should not\nbe in a \"hurry\". Feminism is still in its\nearly stages according to her. To end the\n\"it is time\nto get angry\nagain\"\nevening, she did a book signing, which\nlasted for ages. When we finally got to\nher, the friend I was with asked a ques-tion. It was great to actually talk to her and\nshare just a few minutes with her.\nGreer is an amazing orator and her\nbook is really worth the read. She has put\nFeminism back on the agenda, eventhough some very good literature has\nbeen published in the past few years. This\nis the next step of the battle that lies\nahead for women of the21 st century.\nPublished by Doubleday, \u00a316.99 (hardback)\nD. with the help of j a been Jafferji\nSKIN AND BONE\nby Gareth Creer\nArtie' s sure that his wife,\nMade lal ne, is having an affair.

Overall, he's not doing too well.\nSkin and Bone is a grimly\nrealistic portrayal of urban\ndegradation, obsession and betrayal. On the other hand, It's surprisingly optimistic and Artie is a sympathetic, if\nflawed, character. The story\nfollows Artie's attempts to win back his wife and break out of his situ a tion. In his path are ties of blood and loyalty, and the sinister criminal activities that\nseem to involve everyone. I found it\nhard to put down, right up to the somewhat abrupt and unexpected end. It's a bit of a strange book, to be hon est, but well written and worth checking out. Everything is narrated by Artie, both\nas it happens and as as e ties of memo ries, recalled to illustrate a point. I'm not\nnormally fond of first person, present\ntense writing like this, but here it adds\nIntimacy and enhances the reader's empathy with the narrator, without being\nannoying. The plot is fast-moving, intense\nand gripping. There's a sense of moral\nambiguity and an almost hopeless optimism, which give the book a slightly\n'unusual feel.\nThe strength of the character is ation is one of Skin and Bone's highlights.\nDespite the possibly biased viewpoint\ndue to everything being seen through\nArtie's eyes, the other characters are complex personalities with their own stories and motives. Artie himself develops\ninto an independent, intelligent and surprisingly heroic character, considering that he starts the book checking Made la in' s handbag and keeping a card\ndatabase of her possible lovers.\nThis is Gareth Creer's first novel, and it's pretty damn good. It manages to weave together the plot of a reasonable\nthriller with a tangled web of love and deceit. Not a book to read to your children (the usual graphic sex and violence\nis a little more personal here), but one that'll make you think.\nPublished by Anchor, \u00a36.99\nGareth\n\n"

Displaying their\nclear superiority from the start, victory\nwas never in doubt, and after putting\nthree goals past the Egham keeper in the first fifteen minutes, Holloway were simply playing for dignity.\nTheir victory was all the sweeter thanks to earlier victories from the Mens Thirds in the Reserves Cup and the ICSM\nWomens Firsts in the UL Ladies Cup Final.\nThe medics also triumphed in the Hospitals Cup, where the Men steam added to a miserable week for GKT, the opposition in many of IC's most memorable By David Roberts\nPhotos: Dave Victorious captains collect their trophies - the UL Hockey Cup( left) and the Gutteridge Cup( right).\nfinals this year.\nMoving from astroturf to grass saw IC's Football Firsts wrapping up the Premiership title with a10 victory over UCL,\nto leave them four points clear of LSE in\nsecond place. Coming on top of last\nweek's UL Cup win, this completes a very impressive double for ICFC. Elsew here, an extra-time victory for ICSM in\nthe UH Football final meant that the\nmedics have made a clean sweep of all\nthree major Medical School trophies.\nMeanwhile, cup finals day in Rugby\nsaw victory for both the Mens and Wo mens squads. Having beaten ICSM last\nweek, the men steam went on to complete an historic Gutteridge Cup triumph\nwith a1510 win over GKT (this year's first\ndivision champions), thanks to tries from\nAndy Mayes and Dan l liga zi and: the\never-reliable boot of Chris Dickinson.\nMore impressively still, the women' steam stormed to a landslide victory (also\nover GKT) and went on to collect medals\nfor both the UL Cup and the UL League\n- which they won with an undefeated record and a massive +197 points differ-en ce. Clearly the merger between the IC\nand ICSM teams which took place at the beginning of the year is reaping big rewards.\nButt To Lead ULU Into Next Century\nA tight jy fought contest has seen Matt\nButt elected as next year's Universitf-of\nLondon Union President. The UL U Council Chair beat off tough competition from Goldsmiths' leader Sophie Bolt by\na margin o'f3727, promising to be \"responsive, committed and innovative\"\nin fulfil ing his primary pledge to \"take\nULU out to the Colleges\". Alongside every other candidate, he also promised to fight against differential fees, with or\nwithout the support of theN US. The big story of the elections, how ever, was the victory of New Election in\nthe race for the role of Vice President\nWelfare & Education. Although both of the candidates were well known UL U facets, both Allan Siao Ming Witherlck\nand Seth Atkin received a trouncing from RON, which polled40 out of66 of the votes cast. Although voting for RON is very rare at UL U, the result was not\ngreeted as surprising - Mr Witherick was By David Roberts\nPhoto: Dave Matt Butt delivers\nhis winning manifesto\ndefeated in the same election last year,\nand Mr Atkin is renowned as one of the most outspoken and radical members of UL U Council. A fresh election for the post will take place at the beginning of next term, by which time a compromise candidate will hopefully have emerged. Elections for the two other Vice Presidents saw far happier results for those involved, with both Dennis Fernando and Charlotte A ld rid gc completing simple victories over New Election. Mr Fern ando, the Goldsmiths finance& Societies Officer, will take over the same portfolio at ULU, whist Ms Aldridge, a relative outsider in student politics,\nsecured the role of VP Sports.\nThe final sabbatical position, that\nof London Student Editor, was a straight\nfight between a continuation of the present tabloid style, and a move, towards a broadsheet feel.

    "content": "32 Arts 24 March 1999\nTHE RIOT\nRoyal National Theatre, Cottesloe\nCornwall. What does this word conjure up in your mind? Is it rugged\nscenery, thundering waves and\nthe distant screeching of angry seagulls\nand drowning surfers? Or maybe embittered trawler men moaning about EU\nfishing quotas and dragnet infringements in the Spanish Box? Or is it all\nthose fib Dem MPs that the Cornish\nseem to love voting for?\nWhatever your romantic (or patron-ising!) preconceptions of Cornwall, this\nnew play written by Nick Darke and performed by the well-respected Kneehigh\nTheatre Company will surely reinforce\nmany of them. Honest to God, Cornwall\nreally is full of ye olde sea dogs, quaint\nDickensian capitalists and cheery servants who know their place. Or rather it\nwas one hundred years ago, when this\nplay is set. In truth, the play draws inspiration from a real historical event which\nhappened in 1896 in the town of Newlyn. A long time ago it may have been,\nbut the story also has some obvious parallels with the situation in Cornwall today.\nThis may be difficult, but shut your\neyes for a minute and picture yourself as\na Cornish fisherman. Outsiders are fishing in waters you consider to be your\nown. And they do it on Sundays, damn\nit, when you are all busy being religious!\nLets give them a good kicking and drive\nthem out of town. You get the idea?\nThings arc all going to plan, of\ncourse, until the paternalistic mayor and\nlocal Mr Big (Mr Bolitho) steps in and\ntries to twist the situation to his own\nfinancial advantage. But w had day a know, one riot, a stabbing, a hanging\nand one attempted public execution\ndown the line, things turns out OK for\neveryone, after all!\nAs you can see, the play piles on the\nfarce. But at times I couldn't help but\nwonder whether they actually intended\nthe performance to be some form of\nblack-humour ed social commentary. If\nsocial commentary was their aim, how-ever, they failed. If on the other hand\nthey were going for light satire and\nalmost Shakespearean farce, Ihcy tri-ump he d. The fact that they received a massive laugh for (the usually depress-ing) events of a suicide and a brutal\nstabbing is testament to this comic tri-u mph. Two performances stood out from\nthe rest: Geoffrey Hutchings (Bolitho,\npictured rig hl in main photo) and Emma\nRice (Harriet Screetch). Hutchings, is an\nultra-experienced RADA graduate who\nstarred as Michael Gambon's dim-witted\nsidekick in the MalQrci TV detective\nseries. The grumpy persona of Mr\nBolitho had all the best jokes and Hutchings knew exactly how to ham them up.\nEmma Rice was an equally effective\ncomedian, playing opposite Bolitho as\nthe new servant who has the courage to\nstand up to her employer.\nThe overall performance was very\nslightly marred by the occasional silent\nhiatus, which no doubt was intended to\nadd drama but unfortunately looked as\nif the actor had forgotten her/his lines.\nThis is a minor gripe, however, and\nthe play was superbly entertaining. But\nthe playwright's labour ed parallels with\nthe current pre-millennial social situation seemed a little banal. If you want to\nhave a good laugh then go and see this\nplay; but I certainly didn't buy the social\ncommentary flannel and neither should\nyou.\nWilliam Burns\nIn repertoire until 28th April\nNearest tube: Waterloo\nTickets: student standby available\nICSO ANNIVERSARY CONCERT\nGreat Hall\nAn emotional performance brimming with flair and technical ability provided a fitting\ncommemoration of fifty years of\nmusic by the Imperial Collegi\nSymphony Orchestra in the\nGreat Hall on friday 12\nMarch. The concert also\nmarked the centenary\nof the City and\nGuilds Union\nwho kindly (^r^ sponsored the\nevent.\nOn a day\ntinged with sad\nness for many music\nlovers - the death of the great violinist\nYehudi Menuhin was announced only\nhours before conductor Richard Dickins\nlifted his baton - the ICSO were enthusiastically received by a capacity audience\nupon finishing a programme of Copland,\nProkofiev and Mahler.\nThe concert began\nappropriately,\nconsidering the\nday's sad news,\nwith a thoughtful and\nmelancholy piece -Aaron Copland's Quiet\nCity. The orchestral\naccompaniment was\nthoughtfully phrased, prot jyv i ding support to the\nhighly impressive soloists,\nDaniel Elson and Stephen Hicks on\ncor anglais and trumpet respectively, in\nan accomplished and moving recital.\nMenuhin himself would have been\nproud to witness the ability of violinist\nKahae Han in a stunning performance of\nProkofiev's Violin Concerto in D major.\nKahae, a fourth year student of physics\nand music, was almost effortless in her\nmastery of an extremely testing ,\npiece of music, and was\ngreeted with a rousing recep-tion. The j lyrical first\nmovement\nwas particularly imp res sive, as the\nviolin almost\nfloated above the\nsensitive accompaniment from the\norchestra. Indeed, Kahae made the violin\nsing when required, without losing the\nability to attack the music, as in the\nScherzo.\nThe final movement was characterised\nby the haunting first subject, which led to the\nmagical conclusion, as the flute and violin\nplayed out the final D major tune.

    "content": "24 March 1999 Not the Games Page 13\nNot Happy with just reviewing games Gary S. has invaded the realm of Gadgets\n- Welcome to the world of big toys for big boys and girls.\nX8R-S( Manic Moped)\nHonda\nNext time you manage to escape from the campus and get to wander around the real London streets keep an eye out for the traffic. Normally this means big red buses, multi coloured taxi's and the occasional beaten up stealth Cavalier.\nHowever in the last few years a rapidly\nincreasing number of scooters and moped riders have been finding that\ntwo wheels are rather good at dealing with jams, that they can park for free and that a smart scoot looks pretty cool in the\nsummer. Mopeds and Scoots are the ultimate\ngadget round town. They're obvious, they have some usefulness, but above they look good. The X8R-S( Honda has\ndecided not to give this bike a name just\na sequence of letters that give an impression of an experimental weapon found in a Japanese anime) is Honda' stop of the range 50cc moped. Designed and styled in Italy it has the touch of the Latins about it. The front and rear have\na particularly sculptured appearance and while not having the trick front wheel forks that the Peugeot scoots have nor\nthe rounded design sophistication of the new Italian bikes, the sharp lines which mark the front and back make this\nmoped look much more shark-like.\nAnyway Honda, with a few exceptions, is not known for their radical styling\n- if you think Volvo you will get the pic-ture. Honda are known for producing very reliable and mechanically excel lent bikes and this one is no different. For\n\u00a31800 you get\na50cc engine, a fully automatic belt drive,\nfront\nand J gi^e rate to 25 mph as quick as most tin\nboxes in the town. The fully automatic belt drive means that the bike is incredibly simple to ride.\nJust twist the right grip and the bike\nmoves forward (ok the automatic gearing means that you are not going to\nbe launching the front wheel into\nthe air but on a50cc moped in\nthe city those sort of antics tend to\nrear disc brakes\nand best of all, an electric starter.\nWhat does all this mean. Well the50 cc motor means that you have a topspeed of30 mph, but the ability to acc el attract\nattention of the met police, and don't look as good as\nyou think). The belt drive also means that you dont have any messy, oily chain\nto adjust and check every week. In fact maintaining this bike from\nweek to week involves checking the lyre\npressures, making sure the two stroke oil\ntank has a some oil left, and checking the\nbrake fluid levels. Tasks that take about\nall of30 seconds. Anything more serious\nand the garage will do that.\nThe disc brakes, you have a50cc moped and fit it with the stopping capability not found on some125 cc motor-bikes, you definately stop quickly - usually\na bit too quick for your own good. Finally the electric starter. This is the\ngadget on a gadget. A kickstart on a bike like this usually involves about 5\nseconds of effort, of which three of them is finding the little stubby kick rod. (the\nhand crank on my morris minor is\nanother planet of pain). The electric\nstart is definately for your lazy side.\nThe problem with mopeds is in general the limit er. While the 50cc motor and\nthe gears could possibly do40 mph without messing the acceleration up too\nmuch the law prevents you from doing so. But as long as you never attempt to\ntake on the40 or 50 mph limit roads you will never get bored. Get ahead get a moped. ix usL1( APS Camera)\nCanon\nAnother gadget, another five hours spent\nnot reading the instructions. Though when the instruction book is getting on for half the volume of the actual gadget things are getting a bit serious. Luckily,\nto use this little delight you don't need to read the whole volume of instructions in order to take reasonable photo's to get some of the special functions it\nis worth it but you can usually discover\nthose by accident anyway.\nAPS cameras might be heavily criticised by the serious photographer. The\nnegatives are smaller than the35 mm format, and they cost a fortune to\ndevelop. At the union shop35 mm film\nis cheaper by over two pounds and that\nisn't including the extra charges that add up if you use the extra photo formats.\nAPS definately have a lot of critics, but it\nhas quite a lot of friends too. Some of the friends are big fans of the simplicity of the cameras. None of this messing about everytime you load a new film - just put the film in and close\nthe door (the camera does the rest).\nAPS cameras also can switch\nbetween three types of picture format -normal, enhanced and panoramic. Ok it\nis a little bit of a cheat as the developer\njust selects a portion of the film and blows it up to fit the paper, but the pana rami c shot can make even the most\nboring landscape look fairly impressive -well ok then slightly less boring.\nBut the best thing about APS cam eras is that because of the size of the film\nthe compact camera becomes the spy\ncamera that we all wanted to own as a kid. The Canon Ixus L1 is just such that\ncamera. Its smaller than the smallest of the Olympus35 mmM uj l range and can\neven surprise the most camera aware -useful for catching people doing things\nthey are not supposed to do. After disabling the flash you can shoot and run\nlike the best. The L1 is the middle brother\nof the family. It doesn't have the cheap\nplastic feel of the base Ixus, but it doesn't have the zoom function of the big\nbrother (which, now that I 've got used to\nthe L1, feels so heavy and bulky).\nThe L1 does share some of\nthe optics of the bigger zoom brother. Optics that include a rather nice fast 2.8 lens - nice,\nwhich at the touch of a button\nretracts into the camera giving it ac le an pure profile - sleek and smooth. Another button press and it pops back out ready to take pictures in less than a second. The flash is also part of the\nbody, rather than the popup effort in the big brother - which can occasionally jam, requiring a nudge with an on conducting rod\n- using a metal pin is a simple way to generate a spark generator and a easy way to destroy an ex pen sive camera.\nSmaller than a small thing and looking much sexier than a very\nsexy thing the Ixus L1 has managed to get recommended by\nmost camera magazines as the best of the one hundred pound cameras. It is a gadget and half.\nThe little numbered bubbles dont come with\nthe basic camera.\n&\nf,1r \u00ae\n-\u00ae\nh \u00a9\n\n"

However, a half-page\nreview requires that I explain why for the next 400 words, so...\nPleasantvllle is Happy Days meets The Truman Show \u2022. as an it is ed, bottled\nlook at fifties life, given a neat Trumane s que slant by inserting two nineties\nteenagers into its clean-living world - and although it might sound decidedly silly on paper, the magical journey of Maguire and Witherspoon into their TV isn't really\nthe problem. The real cheese( and we're talking Harrods stilton here) lies in their\nsubsequent actions. You see, whilst\nMaguire is a geeky, TV obsessed freak,\nwho' s entirely happy with a black & white\nexistence, Witherspoon is a flirt y,ou t go ing nineties-child, who takes advantage of\nevery break she gets. So before anyone realises what's going on, the town's teens\nhave discovered sex. And slowly start\nmoving into colour.\nThe true clich e then arrives in the battles which begin between the teens and the adults - or the coloured s and non-coloured s, as the movie insists on calling\nthe m.Oh dear, two clich es for the price\nof one. But, as if that wasn't enough, there are some bizzar e scenes of mass\nbook-burning which arc trying so hard to\nbe symbolic that it hurts. Moreover, by\nmanaging to tie in every class, race or\ngender struggle of the fifties, director\nRoss treats none of them with any respect.\nThat said, however, it's not all bad. Macy and Allen turn in good perform ances( as ever) as the teenagers troubled parents - and Jeff Daniels is curiously off-beat as the owner of the town's malt shop( like any stereotypical fifties\ntown, everyone between the ages of12 and 20 hangs out drinking milkshakes\nand eating cheeseburgers). Most impressive of all, however, are some of the effects. Ross and his cinematographer,\nJohn find ley, work with special effects to show a black-and-white world in which some things and a few people begin switching to colour, producing changes\nwhich are so delicately done that you hardly notice they're there - which is a shame considering that Pleasantville actually contains more effects shots than any\nprevious movie. Nonetheless, you can't help but\nlaugh at the movie, rather than with it. The\nattempts at satire and social commentary fall flat, largely because the issues that\nwere risque in the fifties no longer interest or fascinate a cinema audience. The\nreal sadness, however, lies in the fact\nthat you come away almost 1 0 0 % certain\nthat this story could have been made into a good film...a real shame. O Dave\nAmerican History x**** Starring : Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, Beverly D 'Angelo, Jennifer Lien, Avery Brooks, Elliott Gould\nDirector: Tony Kaye\nNotwithstanding the year-long\nbehind the scenes feud that\nresulted in the jettisoning of cinematographer/ dl rector Tony Kaye\nfrom his own project, American History\nX emerges as one of the year's few genuinely provocative works Impressive enough to counterbalance its nagging weaknesses. However, thanks to Kaye's firing during editing, it's hard to know whom to blame for the film's choppiness, its mixture of rage and sentimentality, or the stride n cy of some of the acting.\nKaye, a Brit who shoots the film with\nfamiliar MTV pizazz( low-angle shots,\npre ten to us slo-mo, some black-and-white scenes), made his name directing\nTV commercials in tu rope. What's not clear is the product on sale here - David\nMc Kenna' s script is either cunningly ambiguous or desperately muddled. In\nracially torn Venice Beach the neo-Nazis\nare pathetic low ll fes, crying out for our contempt.

However, the introduction of Edward Norton the very model of a modern neo-Nazi, with a swastika tat-to oed on his left pec and a gaudy line\nin abuse a rives as a constant reminder of what stereotype we're really looking at. While Norton simmers in jail for killing\ntwo black malefactors, his doting younger brother (Furlong) gets the evil\nmessage. He writes a paper on Mein Kampf, shaves his head and becomes a good little Hitler youth. Then Norton gets out of prison and tries to find a new direction for himself\nand Furlong, and we start to see the reasons behind his racism. He blames his\nfather's death on a laundry list of far-right\ntargets, fate r we learn it wasn't just his\nfather's death that shaped him, but his\nfather's dinner table conversation - but\nthis element feels tacked on, and the movie never convincingly charts Derek's path to race hatred.\nThe moral is simple you've got to be taught to hate. But it's put across\nwithout being forced down your throat,\nand makes for a good and powerful film, whose only flaw is to attempt to cover too much ground in far too little\ntime.Q Todd.\n\n"

It seems that\nwhat comes out of the oven nearly always looks great, however badly the preparation stage has gone. It's often recommended to make your own filo\npastry. I can see little point. The stuff comes both fresh and frozen. Either way, it won't set you back more than a pound for a dozen sheets. Spinach and feta cheese parcels\n(Serves 6)\nThis recipe is based on a classic Lebanese combination: spinach and feta cheese. The pine kernels can be replaced with cashew nuts, which are significantly cheaper and taste quite similar. There's a lot of spinach but it will wilt very quickly, significantly\nreducing in volume. Fresh spinach can be substituted\nfor tinned. In my opinion this is one occasion when you do need to pay for the fresh stuff. If you must use tins, you'll need two. Cooks\nCorner\n1 box of Filo Pastry ( about12 sheets)\n3 0 0 g Feta Cheese200 g Pine Kernels\n1 Medium Onion400 g Fresh Spinach Butter\nMelt the butter in the largest pan you can find,\nthen add the nuts and chopped onion. Cook slowly\nuntil the onion is soft, but not brown. Wash the spinach, then add to the pan. Turn the mixture thor-ough ly to coat the spinach in the butter, and continue to cook very slowly for a couple of minutes. Cut the feta into cubes of about a centimetre square. When the spinach mixture has reduced to a quarter of the uncooked volume, add the feta.\nMelt about50 g butter in a small pan. Meanwhile, separate the cooked filling into six equal portions on a chopping board. Open the pack of filo pastry so that you can get sheets out quickly, but keep it cove red in some way( a damp tea towel is good) to prev ent the pastry drying up. Take two sheets of pastry out at a time. Arrange them on top of each other, offset by45 degrees, such that they form a star shape. Put a portion of filli ng in the middle, then fold up the edges. Stick the top together with a little melted butter, then place\nthe finished parcels on a well greased baking tray.\nPut the tray in the oven, then cook for about10 mins at about200 degrees Celsius, or gas mark\nfive. Serve hot, with a crisp salad. Yes, It's a cartoon tin of spinach.\nWell what would you have put In\nthis space?\nThought for the Day\nThe New Indie\nFirstly, I must apologise for the rather disjointed nature of my last\nliterary sacrifice. At first I thought that naughty Mr Sexton had been tampering with my cigarettes again, but I think I just hadn't recovered sufficiently\nfrom the high jinks of our party. Act u ally, I suspect that someone hijacked my Mal boro Lights on that occasion as well. Ah yes, the party. Those of you who were there might remember some of it. Our neighbours most certainly will,- the music didn't stop for seven hours. That will teach them to undertake ambitious home improvements at te no' clock on a Sunday morning. But seven hours of tunes means just'one thing... dreaded dance. It means three decks, four DJs... house music all night long.[ Say what?] Dance music. It's all a load of toss,\nIsn't it? Everybody knows that students should listen to indie: unpretentious, working-class lads playing cheap gui tars in someone's garage, and pressing to vinyl in someone's attic. The only records worth buying are on tiny,\nindependent labels, so small and numerous that only Steve Lamacq knows them all. Dance, on the other hand, is all manufactured. It's all about Whigfield and Sash!, and only enjoyed by twelve year old girls (and\ntheir mothers). It's a rich kid's pursuit.\nall about clubbing in\nvastly over-expensive,\neclectic, eccentric clothing, on amphetamines and their many colourful derivatives. It's funny, but\nwhen I came to Imperial College, you wouldn't have been able to convince me otherwise, no matter\nhow much Aphex Twin you played me. Times have changed, my friends.\nCast your mind back to the heyday of Brltp op;1994, The Year\nWhen The Guitar Was God, when the seeds of death were already beings own. The guitar bands were shooting them selves In the foot by signing to major\nstream pop, and MorrisAll Campbell sey disappeared into hid-ing, leaving behind only a bunch of yellow daffodils and a melodramatic note. At the same I time, the phenom e In on of the write able CD reared its very useful head. Now, indie artists could drop their seven-inch\nsingles to the floor and produce cheap demos on CD, accessible to everyone. But\nthe dance artists\ncouldn't do this. Why not? Have you ever tried scratching with CDs? How ironic that\nthe traditional main stay of underground guitar should be adopted by pre ten You can have the guitar, but the tio us dance wan kers; decks and fags are mine, lo-fi, lo-tech, one step\nremoved from Edis on' s wax cylinder: the black plastic\ncoin. Pretentious? Sling it, mate. labels. Classic indie became main So there you have it. The face of underground music has been given a permanent nose job. Blasphemous this\nmaybe, but here it comes: dance is\nthe new indie. The record labels are truly independent, truly small, and truly\nnumerous. Beats communicate subconsciously, subliminally event rib ally. The guitars have retreated under a stone; they will be back in another form, as always, and it will be genuinely brilliant when they are: As for me... well, I spent five years\nlearning the guitar, and now I can play\nreally well. But I don't. The guitar sits\nthere, neglected, gathering dust from the polluted Battersea atmosphere. The decks, on the other hand, have\npride of place on my desk... When I was fourteen, I would have shot myself\nif I had known what I would be listening to these days. Positiva and Hoo j Choon s are flavours of the month. My Sex Pistols CDs go unplayed. From my room, and countless other student bedrooms around the country, come the sounds of beats, mixes, cuts, spin-backs, scratching... Oh, and I heard\nJohn Peel, the great punk rocker him self, playing some t week in', thump in' German acid techno the other day.\n' Nuff said. "

Today's cancellation by RAM and the three points\npicked up on Saturday on a mud bath of\na pitch against GKT IV give us 31 points\nthis season, ensuring us of a top five finish and possibly even greater.\nThis achievement did not seem possible at the start when we were still without a point after our first three games,\nthe fixtures computer matching us up\nagainst the eventual high fliers in our first\nfour games, and with such an inexperienced, injury hit team we found it hard\ngoing.\nThe first milestone for us was a point\nagainst the eventual champions (in all\nprobability) and two games later the first\nwin followed, a53 battle royale against\nBarts in which player of the season Tom\nWilson secured his first hat-trick and next\nyear's captain Mike Nikolich made his 6th team debut. Before Christmas a further\nthree points was taken in a game\nnotable for the emergence of Alex as a midfield superstar and a goal of the season contender from Supersub Raby. IC\n6th s were finally upwardly mobile.\nIn the New Year spirits were raised,\nand following a tight 3-2 home win In the\nleague, our assault on the cup could\ncommence. Despite the absence of the\ndefensive pillars that are Tom and Oz,\nthe developing partnership of Booth and\nWilson up front, together with the continental influence of Giret (having\nreturned from injury in midfield) inspired\na71 victory over UCf VI, a team one\nleague higher than ourselves, with Booth\ncollecting a hat-trick and Williams and\nRaval scoring their first goals for the\nteam, the latter a superb team effort.\nThe real test was in the next round\nagainst 4th division Q MW IV. Stifling\nthe game in midfield, we almost pulled\nit off, two sublime breakaway goals from\nTom \"the Doc\" not quite enough to overcome the three scored against us,\nthough \"Big Al\" was unlucky to see his\nheader strike a post near the end.\nSo we were now free to concentrate\non the league, and a great run of seven\nvictories out of nine has seen us climb\nfrom nowhere to the heady heights we\nnow occupy, with the side developing all\nthe time, suggesting even greater things\nare to come next year. Despite 14-1, 8-1 and 5-0 victories during the spring\nterm, game of the season has to be the\n4-2 smash and grab job down at Berrylands against the enemy that is Kings VI.\nAn unbelievable \"backs-against-the-wall\"\ndisplay looked like it would secure a well-earned point with the score at 2-2.\nThat was until Tom and Spinning Top Roy\nweaved their magic, one with an orbit-entering lob over the keeper, the other\nwith a piss-taking run, the likes of which\nman has never seen before, destroying\nthe opposition, jaws dropping in awe as\nit finished 4-2. And we almost missed the\ngame thanks to Mike not liking cheese\non his Big Mac.\nApart from all this the season has\nalso seen a number of friendly games\nplayed, mostly for a reserve team that will\nform the basis of a7 th team next year.\nAlso, Tom bagged his 7th hat-trick of\nthe season today, playing for the 5th s, and this should secure him the top-scorer's Golden Boot for the whole of the\nLondon League, his tally now having\nreached 32, with an extra three in the\ncup.\nApart from him, I would like to thank\neveryone who has played for me this\nyear and has made it such a pleasure to\ncaptain the team. Roll on Sllwood Park\n(Saturday) and see you all at the trials in\nOctober.\nRob Davenport\nHOCKEY: DISCO SQUAD\nIt's the reigning men. Hallelujah!\nULU Reserve Cup Final\nDisco Squad 3\nICSM II 1\nWe have gone all the way. What can you\nsay? What words can embody the joy of\nthe disco squad. Class, style, skill, beers,\nmates. Rezoole Inzuman-ul Haque,\nTommy Cuntle, Cheesey, Bob Pyle lain\nPyle, El Capitano, Baps, Peter Tong,\nChrissy Bull, Ashrafulah Haque, Marky\nBlackmore, Mad McAtar Murphy, Fabio,\nCasanova (walks on water) and Jim Taylor. These are the names of a bunch lads\nwho have just been raised to a higher\nplane. The grass smells sweeter, the sky\nlooks bluer, beer tastes of the summer\nsun. As I stand here on the balcony of\nMotspur park bar the cool air of the\nevening flows past me and all is good in\nthe world.\nThe match Itself was full of drama.\nThe Sundance Kid pulled a bit of magic\nout of his hat after 5 minutes: went\naround 4 of the opposition and deftly\nplanted the ball In the back of ICSM's net.\nThis first goal put some of the fear of the\nSun Medallion into the medics and we\nknew we couldn't have got off to a better start. St. Marys weren't the friendliest\nside we'd ever played, and the entire\nopposition did a good impression of\nNora Batty with PMT whenever the ref\ngave a decision our way.\nWe kept on top of the game\nthroughout the first half and had a seemingly constant stream of short corners,\nbefore fABIO clipped in a sweet strike\ninto the bottom left hand corner.\nAlthough we had but 6 supporters, their\nchants were by now drowning out the\nteeming hoards of medics that had\nturned up to watch their side being\nshown what skillful hockey really looks\nlike.\nHalf time was full of fire and we\nknew then that we were going to win.\nThe second half was tense. St. Marys\nsomehow squeezed one past the mighty\nTong with ten minutes gone and they\nwe te back in the match. Both teams had\ngood chances, but the Sundance Kids\nskilful runs were all to often ended by\nblatantly un skilful barges, but our goal-poa st( of Joy) did its job and kept out a huge St. Marys strike. We put together\nsome moves that would have had John\nTravlota gaping in awe. With three minutes to go, Fabio collected a rebound\nand shot from the top of the D. Some of\nthe crowd was on the pitch - they\nthought it was all over. As the ball flew\ninto the Marys goal and the backboard\ndisappear d in a cloud of dust and splinters we all knew it was now. 'Nuff said.\nDISCO. See you next year.\nSeason review: DISCO SQUAD\nWe have all been part of the best season\nthat the DISCO SQUAD has ever seen.\nWe have won the Cup and dominated\nthe league, winning promotion If not the\nleague itself.\nThe key to understanding the DISCO\nSQUAD is that although we're winners,\nand we've gone all the way - we've\nhad a laugh doing it. Our success is due\nto team spirit rather than skill. That the\nDISCO spirit has reigned throughout the\nseason is a monument to the foundations on which this team is built.\nThe nature of our team-spirit building In the showers after the game has\nbeen dubious to say the least - mainly\nthanks to a certain Flltrum - who can\nspot a dropped soap at a thousand yards.\nWho are we? Tossers? No. Wasters? No.\nWe love hockey, we love beers and If we\nmet you, you'd probably love us.\nHasta Luego - its been a good one.\nC&G FOOTBALL-THE FINAL\nA Very Civil affair!\nCiv. Eng...\nElec Eng..\nAs the sun beat down on Hyde Park, two\nteams of highly trained, ultra-fit sportsmen faced each other across the muddy\npitch. This was it - the final, make or\nbreak, winner takes all. Tunde, the electrical coach and referee for the day\ntossed the coin; civil s called heads and\nwon the kick-off.\nThey lost no time in exerting pressure on the sparks' goal mouth. Alex\n'Zachacrapalot' was vis cio us in attack,\nputting in some thumping shots, expertly\nsaved by some superb keeping. 'Lone\nranger' Druve was a rock in defence,\ntackling hard and frustrating the best\nefforts of Brad 'the Bucket' Baskett to get\nhis name on the score sheet. The frustrated civil s kept the pressure on so\nmuch that\nthey forgot\nabout\ndefence alto-get her. Rocky\nand Bassa\nstarted some\ngreat breaks\nand panicked\nthe defence \u2122\non more than | p| one occasion,\nbut with John\nbetween the posts the civil s felt reasonably safe. Eventually, though, pressure\nfrom Paul and Alex supplied Brad with a goal, not before time.\nA few wild tackles and strongly\nworded\nexchanges\nlater, Elec Eng\ntook advan.tage of a terri-ble, but sadly\nnot atypical\ndefensive\nerror from lain\nand grubbed\nthe ball over\nthe line past\nthe scrambling\nJohn. Then it\nwas halftime.\nThe game\ncould have gone either way. The sparks\nhad their defence regimented, almost\nshoulder to shoulder. Suddenly, though,\nout of the blue, Brad shot a rocket past\nthe keeper and the brick ies had the lead\nagain. Heartened by this they rallied and\nBrad had another - that makes 15 goals\nin three matches. Pretty good eh?\nThe electrical s fought to the bitter end\nbut the day belonged to the bridge\nbuilders.\nWhen we lifted the cup and read the\nengravings we were conti nut inga thirty\nyear domination of this event by civil\nengineering. It last ran from '69 to '72,\nwith civil teams winning each year. It\nmust be rare In any sporting contest for\nany team to have a100% record for thirty\nyears. If you ignore the 27 year uncontested gap.\nThank you to the organisers (C&G Union) and everyone who played and\ncame out to support. It's been a success\nthis year, let's hope it'll be even better\nnext year. lain\n\n"

For the second year running, Holloway duly showed for their token cup appearance. Immediate domination was needed to put these boys in their place.\nIf short corners were sponges, we could\nhave soaked up all the beer spilt on Friday night but our failure to convert them eased the pressure on Holloway. The mighty Morrell opened the scoring with\na direct penalty flick. Andy and Paul had glorious games, running rings around all\nand sundry. O'De a's goal has already\nbeen snapped by the EHA for their next\ntextbook. James kept a solid mid fi eid ticking over with Keylock laying it down champagne style in their left channel. Fluke and Mr. Mangles stifled a forward\nplay down their wing, resulting in the first\ninjury of the day, and some irate comments to the ref. Superb link-ups from\nFluffy provided much enjoyment for the\ncrowd, unfortunately not so much for the\nfemales. Tim's sliding tackle comp liman tcd a solid defence led by Hillbilly\nThorton, with skipper May cock dishing\nout At cam style hassle to their roving for-wards. At halftime the score lin rested\nat 3-0. With the arrival of the original roc-kee ter, B. Collen, the game pace dou bled, but our increasingly flowing attacking style allowed a slip in marking\nand two unlucky goals for the Beach\nBoys. Not to be outdone, Sweater Harris ran, dived and danced his way into the\nfar D. In true JCB style, True man put a finish to one such run and gave slight dis-om fort to the queasy supporters with a glowing white lard-free backside. And where would we have been without the\nadaptability of Noddy Thomas, ably filling\nin at left back due to injuries.

The furious\nrunning game of the first twenty minutes\nwas lost as both packs settled down to\na long, drawn out slugging match. The\nbreak for IC came twenty minutes into\nthe second half, with open side flanker\nDan I liga zi scoring a brilliant opportunistic try of the back of an opposition\nscrum. The IC team could sense victory\nnow, but there was still plenty of work to\nbe done as G KT game back determined not to go down without a fight.\nWith the referee playing way over\nthe 80 minutes normally allowed for a game of Rugby, GKT had put up camp in\nthe IC half. After a series of hard scrum s, GKT finally managed to break our line to\nscore the last points of the game. With\nthe score at 15-10 to IC, and after 94 min-ute s, the referee blew the final whistle.\nDave \"Dynamic reporter\" Pearce\nHaving beaten UCL, St Georges and the\nImperial Medics on our way through the UL Cup, we were finally to meet GKT in\nthe final. We knew that they had put up an excellent fight against ICSM in the UH Cup final and were definitely not to be underestimated. They'd won their first\ndivision league and had thrashed the\nlikes of UCL and Portsmouth.\nThe game started with Imperial\nbeing, quite frankly, crap. Within 5 minutes, GKT had opened the scored sheet\nwith a soft try in the corner. Daz zed and confused, IC knuckled down to what was obviously going to be a fight to the finish. Within minutes, some aggressive\nplay from the IC pack had put Imperial\ndeep into the GKT half. The ball was shipped out to Andy Mayes, who' s strength showed as he penetrated their\nline to score the first points for Imperial.\nWith the score line at 7-5 to IC, both teams fought with passion.

Not only will the move improve the quality of the transmission, but the reception range should also be dramatically increased. The radio station applied for a restricted service license (RSL) earlier\non this term, and is awaiting a reply\nfrom the Radio Authority. The license\nrequests that IC Radio be given an FM frequency from26 April to 24 May, broadcasting from the Akins Building of Kings College in Notting Hill. If the RSL is granted, listeners should be able\nto pick up the station at least three miles away, encompassing most of Imperial's hall of residences. The new license will cost IC Radio\nseveral thousand pounds, and is\napparently being sponsored by a myst e riou s benefactor, the identity of whom has yet to be identified. As Felix\nwent to press no decision had been made by the Radio Authority on whether or not to grant the license,\nonly that \" the application is being processed\". Station Manager Jon Corcoran, however, was enthusiastic about IC Radio's chances, saying\" I IC Radio - soon to be In\nneed of a new logo?\nhave every confidence that the Radio\nAuthority will grant our application\", although he did admit \"RSL frequencies in London have been at a prem i um recently\".\nAnyone interested in producing shows or helping out during the first\nmonth of next term, including current\nradio members, should contact the\nhead of programming or introduce themselves to IC Radio, next to Souths ide Shop.

Is he related to\nBrett Anderson?\nThree former members of the less than well\nknown Levitation have got back together to\nform the entity called Dark Star. They are gaining exposure rapidly and will undoubtedly become more popular than Levitation ever was though admittedly this achievement doesn't take much doing. The Water Rats is an apt name for Dark Star's venue, a name to attract London's seedier residents,\nand the band members, Bic Hayes (vocals), Dave tr an colin i and Laurence O' Keefe fit the bill perfectly.\nFairy lights that are usually only seen during Christmas adorn the microphone stands adding a bizarre\ntouch to the stage. Is this the first sign of Dark Star's gothic tendencies? Looking around at the crowd tonight\nthere could be a fair amount of disappointment if\nthey do go down the goth route.\nThere is relief all round as they steer clear of this\npath and kick off with the ferocious endless rush of thrashed out guitar noise known as I Am The Sun. Bic\nHayes makes the use of two mic s to create the ethereal ghostly effect on the chorus, with lines like 'She\nsaid Jesus was my age when he got nailed / I'm co ming back to you, I'm paranormal'. Fantastic.\nAbout 3 am follows next, initially deceiving the crowd into believing that they're listening to a ballad,\nthat is, until the point where the guitars rip in and prod u ce an uplifting angst-ridden masterpiece. At times\nthey can sound like Blur (but only slightly mind you) with\nthe Oohs and ahs popping up in the background, especially soon What In The World's Wrong.\nBic Hayes slight frame betrays the power of the\nsongs and the pent-up anger that underlies each one. Dark Star thankfully avoid sounding like a metal band\nand manage to fuse a variety of influences to produce a bass heavy distorted sounds cape that, if it existed,\nwould be placed into a new category of music known as 'pre-millennium angst'.\nOn the six minute epic, Graceadelica drummer O 'Keefe shows that he's multi-talented as he starts shaking a maracas about and goes on to use it on the\ndrums.

Then, they make a come back by releasing another album( hoping that no-one's forgot\nthem) and so it becomes an ever predictable pattern.\nTheir latest album is Beaucoup Tlsh,\nand (sadly) it is nothing that we haven't heard before. The album is the bog standard kind of music that was on the last album, which is a shame as you would have thought that Darren Emerson et al might have changed a little bit\nmusically, moving forward with the times\nso to speak. But sadly Underworld seem to have got themselves stuck in a rut\nwith Beaucoup Fish. This latest offering\ngives us eleven tracks, including Cups,\nMoaner, Push Upstairs and er... Push\nDownstairs.\nCompared to the last album Second Toughest In The Infants this one is\nnot that different, but if you like Underw or ld or haven'the ard their music before then this is definitely worth checking out. As usual, the deep bass lines are\nthere In all the tracks and the vocals\nsound like those that were in Born Slippy\nwith that strange robotic sound to them. The tracks last an age and no doubt most of them will find their way into the clubs. But it's nothing to shout about\nand you get the impression that Underworld have become too lazy, predictable\nand dare I say it - boring. The techno-house sounds that were exciting a few years ago have now become the norm, so this album doesn't stand out and you just feel like pressing the forward button\ntwo minutes before the end of the track.\nIt's a bit sad and disappointing because\nas DJs Underworld are up there with the best. It's a pity that musically they haven't developed. Beaucoup Fish isn't that bad an album but it's plain and once you've\nheard one track, you've heard the whole album. EH\nCurm\nBeth Orton - mates with the Chemical Brothers, aren't you jealous?\nT his is Beth's second album after\nthe critically acclaimed Trailer\nPark was released in late 1996.\nIn the intervening period she's been having a good time - from working with her al! time hero, folk-jazz legend Terry Callier to singing on the The\nChemical Brothers' number one album Dig Your Own Hole, to performing to a packed-out tent of10,000 muddy Glastonbury-goers.\nThis album is full of more of the great chilled out soulful songs with intel-li gent, heart rending lyrics that made Trailer Park so successful. It's Beth's voice\nthat really makes this album she has just\nthe right kind of voice that can sing\nthese lyrics and get away with it - not like\nAlanis Morisette who always comes off\nas just being lame, in my opinion. Her\nwork with the Chemical Brothers and others seem to have had an effect too. There are lots more beats on the album especially on Start all seem to weep - a very Portishead-esque, trip py track.\nWhat Beth has managed to do is\nblend some great lyrics and back it up\nwith some solid tunes to go with it. It's hard to say really why this album works\nso well - it just does. Perhaps because it's so refreshing that Beth hasn't sold out to\na big music corporation and kept to her\nroots and the small label she originally\nsigned with - refusing the doubtless million offers of big contracts with even bigger labels. Good on you Beth -1 wish a few more artists would take a leaf out of\nher book and stick to music not cash.\nAnyway, enough of my ranting, on with\nthe review.\nStandout tracks for me are Sweeresf\nDecline - a delicious pianos and violins\nnumber with some heavenly vocals from\nBeth, the title track with some great\nacoustic guitar work and Couldn't Cause\nMe Harm - bliss ed out vocals and some ace ' improvised' hums and has. Lovely.\nThis is another good album from\nOrton - great for chilling out on a Sunday\nafternoon and ripe for some great\nremixes from her mates the Chemicals\nand others. E3\nJoeh\n\n"

    "content": "8 Columns 24 March 1999\nNow I may not know everything about sport, Brian, but I can spot a blinding performance when I see one. The list of titles and trophies appears to be endless, and our fencers, rugby players, footballers, hockey players and others deserve huge congratulation for their efforts. In\naddition, they deserve a couple of weeks recuperation, which is exactly\nwhat they'll get, after the colossal volumes of booze shifted in Southside last Wednesday. Good work fell as. However, our performance in sports\nfacilities procurement has not been as successful. My old sparring partner, Ian\nCaldwell, has long used the line about student behaviour adversely affecting relations with the planning authorities,\nand most of the time I have thought this to be a weak excuse designed to cover up the effect of the desecration brought about in the sixties and subsequent failures by Estates and College. Now I find considerable sympathy for his point of view( never thought I'd say that, did you?). If some prat\ndropped a jar of Sun Pat from a great\nheight on to my Ferrari, I would move Heaven and Earth to scupper Imperial's plans, as well as sue the pants off them. Now, of course, I don' town an antique Ferrari- it's a Bentley- but such behaviour goes a bit beyond accept able, nay mandatory, student behaviour, such as the removal of street\nfurniture and the deposition of' processed' Carlsberg on the walls of the V&A. The College should extrapolate the level of punishment given for some fairly trivial offences in halls,\nwhich would mean expulsion. Strictly\nspeaking it would mean ritual exec u tion, but In these wish y was hy liberal\ntimes, you take what you can get. T he ministrations of the European Commission, save for the odd cucumber decree, do not tend to set the world alight. Of course, that all\nchanged last week. A mass resign a tion, the nuclear option, was mooted sometime ago, but was dismissed as highly unlikely. Thankfully, so dam ning was the report into the behaviour of Edith Cress on, Jacques Santer and others that this course of action was unavoidable. This being the ELJ, none of those named as woefully in ad equate and incompetent accepted the report's findings with good grace. Cress on even suggested that the report\nhad been altered afterwards in order to\nrubbish her, though for that to be true,\nit would have required a near-total\nrewrite. Her behaviour has always been eccentric at the very least; she once famously suggested that 2 5 % of British\nmen were gay as a means of pro claiming the superiority of frenchmen. Simon\nVoice of Reason\nProvided that the French government cease to support this dreadful crea ture, we should have seen the back of her. Others, such as our own commissioners, Neil Kinnock and Sir Leon Brittan, were cleared of corruption and nepotism, but what of competence? These twenty have presided over administrations so bloated and inefficient as to makeS her field appear lean.\nTheir task is\nto implement the Council of Ministers' decisions, but this is\ninvariably done badly and at great\ncost by huge bureaucracies that\nhave ac cum uIa ted over the years ( hang on, this is Sherfield). And as we now know, it is done corruptly. Unsurprisingly, anyone could have predicted this years ago. Commissioners are not appointed on the basis of ability, dear meno. Equal\nopportunities legislation is not applicable here, because nationality decides, in the first instance, who gets which post, a state of affairs that would leave\nany other employer branded a racist.\nOne we' ve decided that, for example, the Irish can have Social Affairs, it's then simply a case of sticking a gove rn ment place man into the position. No recruitment, selection, democratic endorsement. Consequently, people of dubious ability, and in the case of Padraig Flynn dubious standards, are moved to Brussels so that they are safely out of harm's way. Eurosceptic\nrubbish I hear you cry. Oh yeah? Four\nwords: Neil Kinnock, Leon Brittan. Je\npose ma valise. Commissioners should be selected in the same manner as any senior employee, ensuring that\nthe best people do the job. Selection\non nationality creates a vicious circle:\ncountries will choose people who can counterbalance the influence of those from elsewhere whom they do not trust, rather than those interested in\nserving the interests of the EU member states as a whole. This will probably mean that some countries will cease to be represented, but with enlargement on the cards, this is bound to happen anyway. Come to think of it, they may all end up being British (only joking, no need to write in).\nc Baker\nlay ponds aside, it's a bit quiet\nalong the corridors of power at\nthe moment. Only two things seem to be going on, if\nyou omit the Case of The Missing BMS Sign( off to have the diam on d encrusting and gilding, I imagine), firstly, if you j don't religiously follow IC Distorter( also know as\nthe Environ,\u2022. mental SociI e ty1 newsletter,1 on the basis\nI of recent edi-It ions), the I College is\nlooking for a new Rector.\nDepending on whom you believe, Sir Ron is retiring in August1999 or 2000. We' ve all come to expect\na bit of latitude on Suite Five forecasts,\nbut this looks a bit fishy. Night of the long knives? Surely not. Anyway, you can submit candidate suggestions to the College Secretary, but since he's a busy man, please keep them vaguely sensible- no Billy Connolly, then. And for the final time, Iam not available for\na1999 start as my PhD will not have fin-is he d, flattery will get you nowhere. T he other hot potato is Wye Coll e ge.I have a proud record of warmly embracing institutions that\njoin the Imperial family, as any medic will confirm. This is a merger rather\nthan a hostile takeover, so both parties\nare doing their bit. We will stick five or\nsix new levels of management into the\nWye machine so that it is administered as successfully as Imperial, and for their\npart, Wye are going to produce a snappier prayer to the Almighty. Let me explain. It turns out that they have a Latin Grace dating from the15 th century that Is used to this day:' God be praised for all his mercies. God help us\npreserve this free and learned society\nand grant us his grace all the days of our life.' Beautiful, but a little wordy.\nThe new version, seen here for the first time is simply' God Help Us.'\nSubwarden Vacancy\nApplications are invited loi the position oi Subwardr-n.:ome vacant shortly.

    "content": "2 6\n^T*x^ Music 24 March 1999\nAlbums\nBLUR\nKevin the cockerel with a few of his less famous\nmates: Dave, Alex Graham and that other blok e. Think Beatles, think creativity. Of the current\nBritish musical heavyweights,it is Oasis that\nhave been the most blatant in championing the Fab Four, yet their last two albums possess the inventiveness of tired-pub-rockers,- making music in a style akin to painting by numbers. It is Blur who have\nconsistently outshone their peers in the eclectic\nstakes; if there is one band that represents the spirit of The Beatles, it's Blur.\nThe album starts with Tender, which you've ail\nheard - it even got play listed on Radio 2! This sets the subtext for the album, namely Damon' s break-up with\nJustine Frischmann. Over dextrous bluegrass guitar\nDamon preaches the uplifting anthem' Come On! Come On I Get through it / Love's the greatest thing/ I'm waiting for that feeling to come'. In contrast,\npenultimate track No Distance Left To Run finds Damon at his most emotionally wrought 'It's over, I knew it\nwould end this way/1 hope you're with someone who makes you feel this life is the life / Who settles down, stays around, spends more time with you/ I 've got no distance left to run' - if you've heard more profound, heartfelt lyrics you're mistaken.\nIn between these two songs things get seriously\nweird and seriously brave. Gone are the social commentaries of Modern Life Is Rubbish, Parklife and The\nGreat Escape; nowhere are there to be found immediate pop-gems like Badheadand Chemical World. The\nalbum moves on from what their eponymous fifth\nalbum started; ambitious, all be it flawed, cosmic music\nof raw emotion. Stand-out tracks 7992, Battle, Caramel\nand Trimm Trabb convey overtones of failed love over\nsonic soundscapes with startling empathy 'But don't you feel low, I was being ugly / You loved my bed, you got the other instead' - 'That's just the way it is /1 sleep\nalone, I sleep alone '\nYet such is Blur's want, Infuriating throw-away\nthrash y punk and needless instrumentals pepper the\nalbum, diminishing the emotional punch with final\ntrack Optigan I all but destroying the grav it as of No Distance Left To Run.\nStill, a truly remarkable mixed-up, muddled up record It is and divest of a few songs it may of been the masterpiece Blur undoubtedly hoped it to be. It's not quite the last great pop statement of the millennium\nbut it is the final piece of evidence in proving Blur to\nbe the contemporary British band. Can the rest match\nthem? I doubt It. ESI\nChris\nHURRICANE #1\nOnly The Strongest Will Survive\nW ith the rise of Norman Cook and friends in 1998, the music industry saw big-beat surface\nas the new true face of Britpop. With a more upbeat happy sound, party tunes\nsuch as Brimful of Asha and Rockafella\nSkank shot to the number one spot.\nWhile the famous battle of Blur and Oasis faded in the memory, it seemed that happiness was the sound in\ndemand and maybe it was time for\nsome of the old Britpoppers to hang up their hats.\n1999, however, is the year the old Britpoppers hope to hit back. This year\nthere have been album releases from Gene[ Felix 1138], The Stereo phonies[ Felix 1138], Blur [This Issue] and now Hurricane #1. So how are the old-boys\ngoing to fair? Well with a few new tricks,\nthey shouldn't do too badly. Blur took a tip from Spiritualized and introduced a choir on Tender, and not looking to be\noutdone Hurricane #1 enlisted the help\nof Unkle frontman James Lavelle on the title track of the album Only the\nStrongest will Survive. With an array of strings and a classically Unkle drum track\nthe tune produced is Hurricane#1's finest to date. There is however a problem it seems as if this was the only trick\nup the sleeve of Hurricane #1, and as\nsuch the rest of the album does little to\nimpress.\nWith a sound more appropriate to a few year's back, and a number of songs\nnot sounding unlike those of songwriter\nAndy Bell's previous band Ride, the album is more than disappointing. Rather than building on foundations. Hurricane #1 appear to have settled with\nthem and have fallen at the hurdle which\nis the second album. There are a few moments of brilliance on the album, but none of these are sustained for long\nenough or properly built upon to warrant\na song's second listen.\nSo Only the Strongest will Survive is\nan album that is definitely more weak than strong, and if only the strongest do survive, then look out for an obituary on Hurricane #1 some time soon.131 James\nWHISTLER\nWhistler\nO kay, so the photos of the three\nmembers of the band make them look deranged, retarded\nand psychotic in that order, but let's gloss over the fact that we're listening\nto a bunch of outpatients from Bedlam and concentrate on the music.\nInoffensive is the first word that\nsprings to mind. Boring is these con dall the songs sound the same. The vocals\nare pleasant in a soft English rose kind\nof way and while the whole album is in\nthe 'pleasant' vein it doesn't move you or provoke a response. Noone is going to despise Whistler with a passion akin\nto that which I have for Celine Dion or\nMichael Bolton, and the only people who' ll harp on about this are those that\nstill get abuzz if they stay up past eleven\no 'clock and swear. You could almost forget it's there. I mean if you wanted to,\nyou could (wisely ,in my opinion) switch\nit off and see if anyone notices - a great\ngame for parties, I'm sure you'll agree.\nActually, scratch the pleasant and ambiguous bit. I 've listened to it enough times now to come to some conclusions. It's dirge -1 really haven't got a clue\nwhat their aim was in making this album but it certainly wasn't to entertain anyone\nwith half a brain. Sure, all their mates\ndown at the institute'H love it but that's due to the ever-present fact that it's a total no-b rainer. For God's sake, what sort\nof a person pens the lyric 'Emily I want\nyou to be unhappy, be unhappy Emily'?\nIt does gel with all the other horridly\ndepressing songs on the CD, though. On the second listen I couldn't decide whether to hang myself, slit my wrists,\ntake a few too many paracetamol or\ncap myself a la Kurt Cobain. That's all a little harsh - in the end I decided that suicide was too excessive, so I went to lectures instead. CI Christian\n\n"

    "content": "24 March 1999 Editorial 7\nPut Students Before Politics\nVarious recent events, too petty and tedious to go into here, have forced me to have more involvement with ICU\nthan I would like, or indeed think is\nhealthy for the editor of an in de pen dent newspaper. One thine; that has struck me is how little ' Union hacks' know about the common perception of ICU within the student populace. Let me explain. ICU is, of course, an organisation whose raison d'e tre is to provide services and opportunities for\nthe students of Imperial College. In\nother words, it is there to make your life\neasier, and your time at university generally more enjoyable. For most stud ents this manifests itself through cheap beer, food, stationary, newspapers and so on. For many others the clubs and societies provide op port uni ties that would otherwise be very difficult to take advantage of. In the Spring\nTerm, however, friction is at its greatest.\nWhy? Because it is the budget season, and there are always winners and losers.\nTwo particular aspects of this\nannual debate strike me as extra or di nary, firstly, there seems to bean assumption in the Union that the students who run the clubs understand Union finances and have faith that the system will give them a fair deal. Rubb ish. Club treasurers and others involved are told by their predecessors that their job is to get as much money out of the Union as possible, because the Union will try to do exactly the same to them. The basic philosophy is\n'screw them, or else they'll screw you'. We all know this, yet when it comes to the nuts and bolts of committee mee tings few hacks seem to admit it, and certainly not publicly.\nThe second point follows from the first. An'us against them' attitude\nbetween students and ICU is similar to\nthe attitude between students and col-leg e. Consequently it is hardly surprising that many students have difficulty\ndistinguishing between Union and college run facilities. For example, a fourth\nyear Departmental Representative recently informed me that he or she couldn't see any difference between Union money and college money. The problem isn't helped by the social grouping of Union hacks. I know this is a generalisation, and I apologise in advance to anyone misrepresented, but in my opinion Union politicians tend to hang around their own kind.\nEven If it isn't true, i think this view is\nfairly common among IC students, and In this game it's opinions that count. So what' s the conclusion? Well, just\nfor once, I haven't really got one. Just\nto be controversial, I would say that\nperhaps ICU should spend more time communicating its principles, rather\nthan losing sight of them in amaze of rules and regulations that noone outs idea select group of hacks under stands, or indeed cares about. It's the students that matter, and it's their op in ions that count.\nTurn on. Tune In and Help Out\nIf you have read this week's news, you will\nhave noticed that IC Radio is to have an\nFM license for the first month of next\nterm. Congratulations to all those Involved\nin organising it, including the mysterious\nsponsor, and I hope that it proves successful. It will only be successful, however,\nif you listen to it. So retune your radio after\nEaster and give it a try - you may find it different from the 9 9 9 AM station you could-n't quite pick up in your hall room during\nyour first year. Finally, if anyone used to\nbe involved in the radio but has since\ngiven it up, please consider going back -they could do with your help. This is our\nchance to show that student radio at\nImperial can work - let's use it.\nTo Bomb or Not to Bomb?\nOnce again the international community' s bluff has been called, and once again they are standing around without a clue as to what to do, like the emotion ally unstable half of the faure land Hardy\nduo. Noone really wants to bomb Serbia,\nor anywhere else for the matter - it costs\nmoney, lots of money, and as soon as one Western life is lost public opinion turns\nagainst you.\nDiplomacy is not an area I know much about, but it seems to me there\nare two basic ways to get people to com promise. One method is to get them to\ntalk about anything and everything except that which they disagree on. When people acknowledge their simi-lari ties, it is generally easier to overcome their differences. The other method is to\nput them in a room and lock the door,\nand wait until they get tired of arguing\nand release that compromise is the only\nkey to a solution.\nSo what do we do? We draw up plans neither party is happy with, and then give them deadlines by which they\nhave to agree, or else... People don't like\nbeing bullied, and in my experience it\nonly increases their resolve. If you resort\nto threats, you are basically saying 'we do\nnot have a solution'. Worse still, when those threats are empty ones noone will\ntake you seriously, and the influence of 'real' diplomats is severely weakened. Right, That's It. Go Home.\nAnother term has flown by, and I still\nhaven't learned C++. What happened to\nthe Carl Cox interview we were meant to\nbe printing? Why doesn't Howard Marks\nrespond to emails? And where is Felix\ngoing to be next year? I can only hope these matters are resolved in my nine\nremaining issues.\nMeanwhile I'm off home for my regular detox, feeding and extended sleeping session. 1 he office will close for Easter\nsometime this Friday, and will reopen on Monday19 April. The security lodge will\nlook after letters and other deliveries over\nthe holidays. Have a good Easter, don't revise too hard, and please write for felix\nnext term.
