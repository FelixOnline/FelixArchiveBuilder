Following struggling Oboist\nHailey Rutledge,played by a capable\nLola Kirke, the piece chronicles the\nlives of the New York Philharmonic\nOrchestra, as they attempt to get\nto grips with the flamboyant new\nmaverick conductor Rodrigo; a role\nthat Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal clearly\nhas quite a lot of fun with. Garc\u00eda\nBernal really sinks his teeth into\nthe character, deftly encompassing\nthe mix of eccentricity and genius\nnecessary.\nMalcolm McDowell also puts\nin a standout performance here,\nplaying the aging ex-conductor who\nstruggles to deal with the fact that\nhe\u2019s past his prime. It\u2019s great to see\nso if you\u2019re expecting some great\ntreatise about the meaning of life\nthen I really don\u2019t know what to tell\nyou.I mean,why are you looking for\nthat in an Amazon series about an\norchestra? Go read The Master and\nMargarita or something.\nNevertheless, the characters are\nstrong enough to keep the show\nafloat with much of the humour\ncoming from their interactions.\nAnother factor that only helps is the\nseries\u2019 freshness. The subject matter\nis fairly new popular fiction, and so\nevery development and exploration\nmanages to keep viewers interested.\nIf I have any complaints, they are\nthat the show meanders a tad in the\nmiddle of the first season, and that\nat times it can feel too \u2018hipster-y\u2019.\nBut really, what can you expect\nfrom a show produced by Jason\nSchwartzman, and I say that as a\nhuge fan. In fact, the overwhelming\nmajority of this quirk is the good\nkind. If you like Schwartzman\u2019s\nusual shtick, you\u2019ll like this; if you\nenjoy orchestras, you\u2019ll enjoy this,\nand if you\u2019re a fan of good comedy,\nyou\u2019ll be a fan of this.\nMozart in the Jungle is available\non Amazon Prime\nhim not taking himself too seriously,\nand his comedic timing is great. It\u2019s\ntoo bad he doesn\u2019t get more comedic\nwork. The evergreen Bernadette\nPeters also features, owning every\nscene she\u2019s in.\nThe show\u2019s wit is sharp and rarely\npredictable. There are quite a few\nmoments that got big laughs out of\nme, and they never felt stale, trite,\nor done to death. There\u2019s scarcely\na dull moment, and the viewer is\ncompelled to keep watching the\nseries. It is strongly character driven,\nThe show\u2019s\nwit is sharp\nand rarely\npredictable\nB\nojack Horseman is a\nshow about an alcoholic\nhorse who was the star\nof a Cosby-esque family\nsitcom in the 90s, now dealing with\na life of loneliness and depression.\nAlso, it is fantastic.\nThe Netflix original animated\nseries stars Arrested Development\u2019s\nWill Arnett, Breaking Bad\u2019s\nAaron Paul and Community\u2019s\nAlison Brie in a world where\nanthropomorphised animals live\nalongside humans, and that\u2019s hardly\nthe most surreal thing about it.\nBojack, is certainly a show you\nneed to give time to get your head\naround, the first episode gives the\nimpression of a silly, Family Guy\nlike animated show with throwaway\njokes and unlikable characters but\nall of it is building to what has\nbeen called one of television\u2019s most\naccurate portrayals of depression\nand a biting satire of Hollywood\nculture.\nThe show\u2019s central character,\nBojack is a deeply unhappy ex-celebrity,keen to return to the public\neye by releasing an autobiography\nof his years on TV. Brie\u2019s Diane\nNguyen comes in to act as ghost\nthe show begins to really shine in\nthe latter half of the first season.\nIt displays the fact that, with the\npossible exception of Paul\u2019s Todd,\nno character in the show is without\ndepth. Even the seemingly one-dimensional (if hilarious) Mr\nPeanutbutter displays some of his\nown demons that he\u2019s battling.\nThe second season brings in\nsome new players in the form of\nLisa Kudrow\u2019s Wanda Pierce (an\nowl) and Ben Schwartz\u2019s Rutabaga\nRabitowitz,each fantastic characters\ncomplementing the remaining cast.\nThe second season also marks a\nshift from the satire of Hollywood\nand towards more personal stories,\ntopping with a truly devastating\nscene involving someone from\nBojack\u2019s past.\nBojack is a show you need to be\nprepared for,a ride of ups and downs\nand testament to the success of\nNetflix\u2019s release all at once method\nof showing TV.\nBojack Horseman is available on\nNetflix\nwriter for this and serves as the\noutside look into Bojack\u2019s mind.\nThe series shifts between wacky\nhumour coming from the world\u2019s\nanimal inhabitants and long drawn\nout pieces of wordplay (\u201cThere is\nnothing funny about stealing a meal\nfrom Neal McBeal the navy Seal\u201d)\nthen hits the viewer with glimpses\nof Bojack self-loathing, Diane\u2019s\ndeep insecurity and the shallowness\nof Hollywood culture.\nAfter some difficulty finding its\nfooting in the first few episodes,\nNo character\nin the show is\nwithout depth\nT\nhese past few years, we\u2019ve\nseen a sudden shift in\npopularity of several\nonline streaming sites\nwith Netflix, Hulu and Amazon\nPrime being the most popular of the\nbunch. They\u2019ve added competition\ninto the television market and are\ngrowing in popularity by the day.\nNetflix have also been expanding\ntheir reach, now present in most\ncountries around the world. With\nall this growth, it begs the question,\ncan these online streaming sites\nreplace live cable TV altogether?\nFirst we need to examine why\nthese services have been so popular\nand what they provide that makes\nthem more appealing than cable.\nThe most prominent feature of these\nservices is that they are convenient.\nAs they are online services, it\nmeans all you need is an internet\nconnection and a subscription\nand you\u2019re ready to go. This means\npeople can use devices like laptops,\ntablets and mobile phones to watch\nTV shows and movies, wherever\nthey may choose. Of course you\nneed internet access but in this day\nand age that\u2019s not really a problem.\nIt\u2019s not just convenient in terms of\nwhere and how you can watch, it\u2019s\nalso useful in that you can choose\nwhen to watch as well. You don\u2019t\nneed to wait for a particular hour on\na certain day and build your activities\naround said hour.It is completely up\nto you when you want to watch, and\nalso how much you want to watch.\nBinge watching is a natural follow-however, one should also look what\nthe internet in general has to offer.\nFor example, in places like YouTube\nand Twitch, creators are able to\nprovide content which caters to\nspecific audiences. Watching people\nplay games, reviewing and reacting\nto movies and even teaching some\nskills, there is usually something\nthe internet can provide for you. It\nis easier to get access to something\nreally specific you have in mind.This\nis a far cry from cable TV, a feature\nit probably can\u2019t really implement as\nit tries to cater to the majority.\nOnline streaming services are also\nusually cheaper than a conventional\nTV package. So with all these\nadvantages, can they truly become\nthe primary method of TV viewing?\nNetflix\u2019s president Reed Hastings\ncertainly thinks so,recently claiming\nthat internet TV will replace linear\nTV in the next 20 years or so.\nHowever personally, I don\u2019t think\nthis is happening any time soon and\ndefinitely not straight away.\nAs great as these sites are and\nmay seem to be, they have their\nlimitations. For example, not all\nthe shows and movies are available\non any one site. To watch all your\nfavourite shows, you may need\nto subscribe to several different\nservices all at once. Also some\nshows just simply don\u2019t have an\nonline presence at all. To add to\nthis, shows and movies are regularly\ntaken down and brought back\ndue to a multitude of reasons on\nvarious services. One of the perks of\ncable TV is just browsing through\nchannels and finding a random\nmovie you want to watch, or seeing\na rerun of your favourite old series.\nAn additional point to note is\nthat most content-producers and\npay-TV operators have been adept\nat making sure consumers cannot\nwatch current episodes of their\nfavourite shows.In other words,they\nhave not made the same mistake\nthat newspapers did a decade ago,\nGame of Thrones has a very large\nbudget as well as planning behind\nit, and it is a very long time before\nbefore something like Netflix will\nbe able to produce something\noriginal along that level of scale and\ncalibre. That hasn\u2019t stopped them\nfrom continuing to produce various\nunique shows to enjoy, however,\nand it is great that they\u2019re churning\nthem out, albeit slowly.\nA major obstacle these sites have\nis also the inability to air live sports.\nThe rights to live sports and their\nchannels are expensive and they\nare a market online streaming sites\nhave not been able to take over. You\ncan\u2019t really binge football games; the\nfun is watching them in a group,\nsocializing and commenting on the\nplay.\nOnline streaming services\ndefinitely have their advantages\nand sure as heck aren\u2019t going away\nany time soon. In the short term,\nthey haven\u2019t even come close to\nkilling cable and it is more likely\ncable TV will have a prolonged\ndecline. The number of households\nhaving cut the cord entirely is pretty\ninsignificant compared to cable\nsubscribers.\nHaving said all this, the switch\nto online TV is a meaningful one,\nand has the potential to accelerate\nover time. There are children who\nhave, and will, grow up without\ncable altogether. Internet connected\nsmart TV\u2019s are also becoming more\npopular and people may well opt\nout of paying cable and just stream\nNetflix in their living rooms. Until\nthat time, I\u2019ll just sit down and\ncheck what BBC One has to offer\nat 11pm on Saturday night.\nup from this ease of access; after a\nlong, busy week of hard work, it\u2019s\nusually a relaxing experience to\njust lie in bed and watch all the\nepisodes of your favourite series in\none sitting. These services are also\na different experience altogether.\nYou can note down your favourite\nshows and movies and get updates\non new episodes as well as get\nrecommendations for other things\nto watch. With all these things, it\u2019s\nnot a surprise to see why so many\nstudents use them.\nTaking a step back from TV\noffering the same content online\nfor free that they expect subscribers\nto pay for. A lot of content-owners\nhave restricted the rights of these\nstreaming sites so they cannot air\nshows until after they have aired live\non television.\nThe scope and cost of making a\nnew show are also pretty substantial.\nWhile these sites do have a number\nof brilliant, original shows like\nHouse of Cards, they are not in a\nsignificantly large quantity and\na vast majority of hit dramas are\nstill on traditional, live television.\nAll you need\nis an internet\nconnection\nand a\nsubsciption\nand you\u2019re\nready to go\nA large\nnumber of\nhit dramas\nare still on\ntraditional,\nlive television\nFull of style and substance.

Photo by Tristram Kenton\nM\naybe Caryl Churchill\nshould be worried.\nThe past 14 months\nhave seen a mass\nexcavation of her earlier work, with\nfour of her works being produced\nin the UK. From Maxine Peake\u2019s\ntongue-twisting turn in The Skriker,\na highlight of the Manchester\nInternational Festival, to the\nNational Theatre\u2019s double bill of\nLight Shining in Buckinghamshire\nand Here We Go, Churchill\u2019s work\nhas been granted an attention\nnormally reserved for the recently\ndeceased.\nBut she is alive and kicking at 77\nyears of age, still preoccupied with\nfragile mortality, as evidenced by\nher newest work, Escaped Alone,\ncurrently showing at the Royal\nCourt. In her typically blunt style,\nthe play is a trim 50 minutes long,\nalthough within that time she\nmanages to pack in more questions\nChurchill\nexplores\nthe space\nbetween\nsentimental\nunexamined\ndomesticity\nand a void\nof existential\nhorror\nand concepts than most playwrights\ndo with twice the length. Well\ninto her fifth decade of writing,\nChurchill\u2019s advancing age is perhaps\nreflected in the choice of cast: four\nwomen who are all described in the\nscript as \u2018at least seventy\u2019.\nSuch a combination is incredibly\nrare in theatre (indeed, in any\nart form), and it seems that the\nfour leads are all ready to prove\nthemselves, putting in electrifying\nperformances: Deborah Findlay\nis Sally, an ex-medic with a\npathological fear of cats; Kika\nMarkham bends her body into a\nrigid ball of energy as the nervy\nLena, who suffers from depression\nand agoraphobia; June Watson\nhardens herself as the ex-con,\npossible murderer Vi; and Linda\nBassett puts in a barnstorming\nperformance as Mrs Jarrett, the\nneighbour who encroaches on the\ntrio, and is as a result inevitably on\nthe periphery.\nThe four women sit in the garden\nduring a warm afternoon, and\ndrink tea, that most parochial and\nEscaped\nAlone\npacks\nin more\nquestions\nand\nconcepts\nthan most\nplays twice\nits length\nThe veteran playwright packs a punch with a powerful and lyrical indictment of modernity\ncosy of commodities, one whose\ninoffensive charm rests upon a\nfoundational history of colonial\nexpansion, oppressive empire, and\nthe slave trade. It is this space,\nbetween a sentimental unexamined\ndomesticity and a void of existential\nhorror, that Churchill inhabits with\nher work; indeed, this dichotomy\nis expanded upon quite literally, as\nthe green lawn intermittently gives\nway to a blank nether-world, where\nMrs Jarrett relays stark messages\nof disaster upon disaster. Is it a\nprophecy? A warning? Nothing is\ncertain. Designer Peter Mumford\u2019s\nlighting is brutal \u2013 a coil of metal\nwire glows around the periphery of\nthe stage,like a coiled filament of an\nincandescent bulb, or the familiar\norange flame of a toaster, only any\nwarmth is snuffed out by its scale,\nas thoughts of home comforts spill\nover into industrial wastes.\nJarrett\u2019s descriptions of the\nbleak future are delivered with\nan abruptness that is by turns\ncomic and desolating.

P&O ferries\ntook the decision not to allow the\nstudents to travel when they were\nscheduled to.\nIn an email, sent as the students\nwere heading back to London\nhaving been turned away, the club\u2019s\ncaptain told members that \u201c[P&O]\nwere willing for us to be allowed on\nafter a 2-3 hour wait. Unfortunately,\nthe coach drivers were unwilling\nto co-operate, hence are currently\ndriving us back to London\u201d.\nThe trip from Hammersmith\nto Dover had not been without\nissue. The coach company\u2019s depot\nmanager was first contacted by\nthe driver at 3:30am over the\nstudents\u2019 behaviour. The coach left\nHammersmith as scheduled at a\nquarter past midnight on Saturday.\nThe coach company alleges that\nsome students caused damage at\nMaidstone service station, which\nP&O ferries confirmed. The\nboat club denies that there were\nany complaints made during the\nplanned stop in Maidstone.\nThe boat club was told by P&O\nthat they could take a slightly later\nferry, but as the coach driver was\nGrace Rahman\nEditor-in-Chief\nThe Student Newspaper of Imperial College London\nThis tweet was sent after the party were turned away at Dover.\ngetting close to his legal driving\nlimit time, this would be impossible.\nThe Dover port police were called,\nto help the coach get out of the\none way system before the group\nwere driven back to Hammersmith.\nUpon returning, the group tried to\nbook another coach in an attempt\nto save the short weekend trip, but\ncould not.\nDrinking was heavy on the trip,\nwith some rowers reportedly having\nport bottles strapped to their arms,\nthat they weren\u2019t allowed to remove\nuntil the bottles were finished.\nThe trip,which cost \u00a380 per ticket,\ninvolved two coaches and 100\nstudents, who each pay \u00a370 per year\nfor club membership.\nSome students had previously\narranged to fly or take the train to\nLeuven instead.

It makes sense as\nhis lyrics are generally tinged with\nteenage angst.Rat Boy sounds like a\nJamieT clone who could potentially\nemulate the success of the original\nbut I feel like he\u2019s a bit of a \u2018record\nlabel manufactured\u2019 Jamie T rather\nthan something more natural.\nThe sound quality is extremely\npoor (with a sound check almost\nseeming like an impossibility). The\nkiddies mosh like there\u2019s nothing\nwrong but a loud siren-like sound\nplays between songs, and I\u2019m unsure\nif it\u2019s intentional or not (it didn\u2019t\nsound right at all). The rest of the\ncrowd almost look surprised and\nshocked that the music gets such\na good response. There was even a\nstage invasion during the last song\n\u2018Fake ID\u2019, which I\u2019m sure all of his\nfans would have needed to buy any\ndrinks during the evening.\nHaving listened to studio versions\nof some of his songs previously,\nthey\u2019re actually quite good, if\nunoriginal. Maybe with a sound\ncheck, he may have been much\nbetter than he was on this evening.\nHowever, from the audience\nparticipation I saw this evening,he\u2019ll\ndo well no matter what happens.\nBloc Party\nBloc Party\u2019s return after a two year\nhiatus was surprising due to the fact\nthat half of the line-up had left\nduring the break. Replacing Matt\nTong (drums) and Gordon Moakes\n(bass) with Louise Bartle and Justin\nHarris, respectively, the band have\nbeen building up to the release of\ntheir new (less than acclaimed)\nalbum Hymns.\nEntering with new song \u2018The\nGood News\u2019, they started out a\nbit too slow and the energy of\nthe audience was slightly drained\nwith mild swaying being the most\nactive response. It\u2019s a nice start but\nnothing special. To me, it felt like if\nit continued in this way this could\nhave been the most dull concert I\u2019d\never been to.\nThankfully, they go straight into\n2008\u2019s \u2018Mercury\u2019. Whilst it\u2019s not\nBloc Party\u2019s most famous song, the\ndancey vibes of the song energise\nthe audience. Kele Okereke (lead\nvocals, rhythm guitar) hypes up the\ncrowd with some playful banter.The\nmusicianship of Harris is truly seen\nto be great, and perhaps supasses\nhis predecessor; he performs with a\nsaxophone rather than a synth which\nmakes the song have a bit more\nof a \u2018human\u2019 feel. Moving swiftly\non to \u2018Song For Clay (Disappear\nHere)\u2019 and the classic hit \u2018Banquet\u2019,\nthe crowd starts to finally form a\nreasonable mosh pit (for a free gig,\nanyway). The band also seem to\nenjoy themselves, relaxing into the\ncorporate setting. Bartle shows her\nRacism is so metal\nRob Garside\nWriter\nT\nhis article is something I\nneed to get off my chest.\nI love heavy music with\naggressive themes, from\nBlack metal to hardcore to grind \u2013 I\nlove it all. I love the catharsis and\nthrill that a pounding drum and\npalm muted guitar line can provide\nbut sometimes the shit that comes\nwith it really makes me wonder why.\nMetal has well established\nproblems with racism (see: below),\nsexism (see: lack of inclusion of\nany female members unless they\nare overly sexualised in a \u201cfemale\nfronted\u201d band) and a culture\nthat suffocates new ideas or\nexperimentation (see: recent festival\nbills with the same headliners as in\nthe early 90s).\nThis week it was racism that reared\nits ugly head. What has particularly\nset me off is the latest event in a long\nline of racist events (Google it: there\nare a couple) that make up Phil\nAnselmo\u2019s life. At the last week\u2019s\nannual commemoration of iconic\nPantera guitarist Dimebag Darrel,\nthe former Pantera member (also\na member of Down, Superjoint\nwhite wine backstage). This was\ncaptured on camera and put up\non YouTube (however the video\nwas put up on video a week after\nthe event as the filmer was afraid\nof the backlash from tarnishing\nAnselmo\u2019s name). The video is\nconclusive, Anselmo\u2019s actions were\nhorrific.There is no doubt that he is\na piece of scum who, whilst a gifted\nvocalist, deserves to be recognised\nand castigated by the mainstream\nmetal media for the awful bigot he\nis.\nBut instead of reacting to a\nclear scandal (although one that\nhas happened a bit too much in\nAnselmo\u2019s life) metals major media\noutlets reacted slowly \u2013 if at all \u2013\nto this despite in some cases being\npresent at the dimebash event.\nKerrang, Decibel and Revolvers were\nloath to call Anselmo out on his\nclearly racist actions as they were\nseemingly afraid of damaging their\nworking relationship with a metal\nicon (Decibel and Revolver have had\nno mention of this even happening\non their site in an age when being\nfirst to report on everything is so\ntreasured). Others such as Metal\nHammer chose to hide behind safe\nlanguage using terms like \u201cNaziesque gesture\u201d and \u201callegedly\nshouted White Power,\u201d when the\nguy clearly did it. Eventually after\nthe smaller blogs had broke the\nnews (and a couple of days later\nwhen the mainstream media finally\ncaught up), these new articles\nwere bombarded with metal fans\ndefending Anselmo. Cries of \u201cit\u2019s\njust a joke\u201d and \u201cmetal is meant\nbeen released at this point, very few\npeople in the crowd knew the songs\nand the feeling from the crowd\nwent to euphoria to frustration\nvery rapidly. People were calling\nout for (debut album) Silent Alarm\ntracks during this marathon of\nnew songs, with Kele asking \u2018Who\nlet these fools in?\u2019 but alas most\npeople agreed with the hecklers.\nIt was saddening to see as the live\nversions of the songs are a lot better\nthan the studio versions, especially\n\u2018Different Drugs\u2019. Saying that,\n\u2018The Love Within\u2019 was just barely\nlistenable to (though the album\nversion is actually unlistenable)\nand got the best response of the\nnew songs. The band also seemed\na bit disappointed with the general\nresponse from the audience during\nthis segment but they were playing\ngenerally very boring parts, with\nthe raw skill of the band not on\ndisplay. In particular, the drumming\nis extremely basic and disappointing\nto watch as Bartle is clearly capable\nof performing to a much higher\nstandard.\nThankfully, the concert did finish\non a high with the Silent Alarm\ntrack \u2018This Modern Love\u2019reminding\nmost people why they fell in love\nwith Bloc Party back in the mid to\nlate 00s. Russell Lissack (guitarist)\nstill impresses to this day and the\naudience were practically hugging\neach other at the climax. It\u2019s truly\nthe highlight of the night, and I\nwould even go so far to say it saved\nthe gig.\nAsking the audience if they\n\u201cwanted a banger\u201d, Kele and co\nfinished with \u2018Ratchet\u2019 which\nproduced the most violent mosh\npit of the night despite the odd\nperson still heckling the band for\nmore Silent Alarm tracks rather\nthan a (somewhat) recent hit. It was\na great way to end a concert with\nthe energy of the crowd equaling,\npossibly even surpassing, the energy\nduring \u2018Banquet\u2019.\nAfter this, the band left the stage.\nDespite cries for another song, with\nthe most popular suggestions being\n\u2018Helicopter\u2019 and \u2018Flux\u2019, the band\ndid not return. I can\u2019t blame them\ncompletely for leaving without an\nencore, as it was a corporate gig and\nthe fact that a large number of the\naudience seemed disinterested with\nthe band.\nSaying that, the disinterest was\na result of the uninspiring setlist. I\nbelieve they could have gotten away\nwith a Hymns heavy set but they\nneeded to spread the new songs out\na bit more and it did feel almost\ncriminal to not play \u2018Helicopter\u2019.\nMany left disappointed, despite the\nevent being free, as the crowd and\nprobably the band knew how much\nbetter this concert could have been.\nto be offensive\u201d echoed from the\nkeyboards of hicks.\nIt should take no explaining why\nI\u2019m annoyed at this but let\u2019s spell\nit out. Famous man uses a far right\nsalute and slogan. Man in crowd\nvideos racist stuff and waits a week.\nBig media fails to report it despite\nbeing at the event (they were happy\nenough to host videos of Anselmo\nsinging the Pantera classic \u2018Walk\u2019)\nand despite seeing the video. When\nreported, a scary number of metal\nfans didn\u2019t seem to work out that\nracism is bad and can\u2019t be excused\nas a joke.\nIt really annoys me that a society\nin love with being a subculture and\n\u201cfor the outcast\u201dis so bad at excusing\nthe persecution of minorities.\nNot cool metal world.\nNot cool.\nPhil apologises.

Photo: courtesy of Whitechapel Gallery\n\u201cLorna\u201d by Lynn Hershman Leeson. Photo: courtesy of Whitechapel Gallery.\nThis\ncollection\nof work is\nexuberant,\nground\nbreaking\nand wholly\nrevolutionary\ninto television programmes,\nallowing starving commuters to\nwatch breakfast on iPlayer, to a\nman-made landslide that buries\nvillagers, with fragments of rock\nlanding \u2018onto the designated child\u2019s\nhead\u2019, Churchill\u2019s text is a relentless\ntake-down of modernity. With\nmentions of property developers,\nlaptop cancers, and poisonous sugar,\na comparison could be made with\nCharlie Brooker\u2019s Black Mirror\nseries,although Churchill\u2019s ideas are\nmore refined and abstract, bracing\nin their meaningless surrealism. Her\npenchant for chaos seems instead\nto draw on the work of speculative\nwriters, especially J. G. Ballard\u2019s\nthemes of social isolation and\nresolution through turmoil.\nHer writing, as well, continues\nto develop. Escaped Alone is full of\nphrases that stick in your mind,\nswirling round and round like an icy\nmist \u2013 \u2018the chemicals leaked through\ncracks in the money,\u2019 \u2018children fell\nasleep in class and didn\u2019t wake\nup.\u2019 At points, she takes both the\nlanguage and the performers to\ntheir limit, with a monologue\ndelivered by Findlay at a breakneck\nspeed rivalling Beckett\u2019s Not I for\nits poetic lyricism. Churchill leads\nus, as an audience, up to a point\nwhere language begins to fracture,\nrevealing its complete, abstracted,\nquicksilver character.\nThe repetitious nature of Mrs\nJarrett\u2019s interspersions, of which\nthere are seven, begin to suffer from\nfamiliarity towards the end of the\nplay, and nothing feels as gripping\nas when she first steps from the\ngarden into the black wastes. But\nstill, this is some of Churchill\u2019s most\nclear-cut,daring writing to date; the\nscenes in the garden, which sizzle\nwith a charged undercurrent of\nunease and neglect, are beautiful in\ntheir awkward terror.\nThe French philosopher Simone\nWeil wrote that loving one\u2019s fellow\nman is merely a question of asking\n\u2018what is your torment?\u2019 Escaped\nAlone offers us the opportunity to\nsimply listen,and try and unpick the\nrotting agony lying just underneath\nthe skin of her four leads. It is an\nunsettling, brilliant work; we have\nmore to fear from Mrs Jarrett\u2019s\nprophesies than from the thought\nthat Churchill could \u2013 after fifty\nyears \u2013 be losing her brutally-cold\nforce.\nAt the Royal Court till 12 March.\nChurcill\u2019s\nlanguage\nreveals a\nabstracted\nquicksilver\ncharacter\nLinda Bassett as Mrs Jarrett. Photo: Tristram Kenton\nGoing back in time on the Electronic Superhighway\nThe landmark exhibition brings together 50 years of art and technology co-evolution\nFred Fyles\nFilm Editor\nNam June Paik in the mid-70s, has\nfast become a relic of the bygone age\nof utopian technology. While Paik\u2019s\nidea of a communication revolution\nthat has become so far-reaching as to\nbecome, in his words,\u2018a springboard\nfor new and surprising human\nendeavors\u2019, modern technology has\ninstead brought with it the threat\nof coercion, manipulation, and\never-present surveillance. While\nsuch an optimistic view of human\nendeavors has since been consigned\nto the growing pile of historical\ndisappointments, the Whitechapel\nGallery is unafraid to take a\nretrospective look at the concept.\nIndeed, it forms the name of its\nnewest exhibition, which looks back\nat the past 50 years of interaction\nbetween the artistic and the digital;\nthe phrase\u2019s ethos is reflected in this\nretrograde collection of work, which\nis exuberant, ground-breaking, and\nwholly revolutionarily.\nAs first impressions go, it\u2019s a bit\nof a surprise. The Whitechapel\nhave taken the (as far as I know)\nunprecedented decision to\narrange the exhibition in reverse\nchronological order, and the result\nis something that is an exhibition\nstriking in its immediate familiarity.\nFor most retrospectives, be it of\nCaravaggio or Caro, the collection\nwill take a strictly normative\nchronological route; the result\nis an exhibition that tends to be\nmost familiar in its centre, where\nartists reach their creative peaks,\nsandwiched between early periods\nof juvenilia, and later works that\nsimply seem outdated. In contrast,\nthe Whitechapel exhibition begins\nwith what is most relevant and\nfamiliar: artworks produced in\ndirect response to the needs and\npressures of the modern age.\nThus, we have Amalia Ulman\u2019s\nfour-month long project Excellences\nand Perfections, perhaps the first\npiece of performative art produced\nentirely through the medium of\nInstagram, and Mahmoud Khaled\u2019s\nstaged conversation Do You Have\nWork Tomorrow?, which transforms\nthe virtual social space of Grindr\nto a physical, temporally-isolated\nreality. The interplay between the\npromise of increased connectivity\nsocial media brings, and the isolated\nactuality, it a running theme. As\nwe move back in time through the\nexhibition, the references in the\nwork become more and more dated,\nand the technology used cruder;\neventually, we reach the last room,\nwhere Peter Sedgley\u2019s circle works\nappear to shift before our eyes\ndue to the changing lighting, and\na poster for the ICA\u2019s Cybernetic\nSerendipity exhibition questions\nthe new shifts technology will bring\nto the art world \u2013 a seismic change\nthat we have just surveyed in the\nprevious galleries.\nOf course, such a concept would\nbe mere window dressing if the\nwork inside weren\u2019t any good.\nLuckily for us, the curators at the\nWhitechapel have managed to put\ntogether a cutting and incisive show,\na wide-ranging retrospective of the\nlast half-century, which will surely\ngo down as a landmark exhibition.\nFrom the off, we are introduced\nto artworks whose themes, while\npossibly synonymous with modern\nlife, have their roots within the\nadvent of the technological\nrevolution.The nature of the cyborg,\nomnipresent in popular culture since\nthe 1960s, is explored in Aleksandra\nDomanovic\u2019s work, which uses\nthe \u2018Belgrade Hand\u2019 \u2013 the first\nartificial hand with five fingers \u2013 to\nexamine the relationship between\nman and machine. Elsewhere we\nhave mediations on the theme\nof representation in the virtual\nworld; in a society where our self-representation is primarily made\nup of online data, the disturbing,\ndizzying video works of both Ryan\nTrecartin and Jacolby Satterwhite\nshow us the self-empowerment of\ncreating our own narratives.\nThis theme of narrative control\nis echoed in earlier works, such\nas Olia Lialina\u2019s 1996 work My\nBoyfriend Came Back from the War,\nand Lynn Hershman Leeson\u2019s\nseminal interactive work Lorna.\nThe latter tracks the decisions of\nan agoraphobic woman, while the\nformer explores the relationship\nbetween a distant couple after an\nunnamed conflict, resulting in a\nmosaic of hauntingly black screens.\nThe depressive nature of both is\na bold contrast to the exuberant\nworks exhibited towards the\nbeginning of the exhibition. Nam\nJune Paik is given a near-obligatory\nmention with his multi-screen\nassault Internet Dream; but while\npersonal self-expression may have\nfulfilled his prediction for a playful,\nliberating world of technology, it\nhas come at a price, and the more\ncontemporary pieces belie a sense\nof creeping encroachment of civil\nliberties.\nTrevor Paglan\u2019s map-based work\ntraces the cable-routes through New\nYork, juxtaposed against the NSA\u2019s\nfamously-blocky slideshows, while\nhis piece Autonomy Cube allows\nvisitors to hide their movements\nthrough use of an encrypted Wi-Fi\nsignal. Elsewhere, James Brindle,\ncoiner of the New Aesthetic,\nprovides the most directly cutting\npiece in the exhibition with\nHomo Sacer, a facsimile of the\nannoyingly-chirpy, happy-valley-esque human holograms found\nin airports that quotes lines from\nUK legislation, warning visitors\nwith the threateningly bureaucratic\nclaim that \u2018citizenship is a privilege,\nnot a right\u2019. The addition of Addie\nWagenknecht\u2019s Asymmetric Love, a\nchandelier of CCTV cameras that\nhang over the room, is a playful\nwork, but has all the nuance of a\nBanksy piece.\nNever fear, resistance to erosion\nof civil liberties is at hand. Douglas\nCoupland defies Facebook\u2019s facial\nrecognition system by replacing\nvisages with Mondrian-esque\nblocks, echoing designer Craig\nGreen\u2019s plank masks; Rafael\nLozano-Hemmer\u2019s Surface Tension,\na giant eye that follows the patron\nround the gallery, allows us to\nconfront the usually-indelible\nforces of surveillance; and Zach\nBlas\u2019 work joyfully subverts both\nthe heteronormative nature of\ninternet technology,and the force of\nunfettered capitalism propelling it.\n\u201cElectronic Superhighway\u201d may\nseem like an anachronistic phrase,\nand indeed, many of the pieces\ndisplayed in the exhibition attest\nto the faster-than-light nature of\ninternet trends. ASCII art, early\nweb interfaces, and scratchy live-TV broadcasts are all dragged out\nof the broom closet of technological\nhistory,and brought to the forefront.\nCory Arcangel\u2019s work, which sees\nan Instagram post of Paris Hilton\noverlaid with a MySpace ripple\neffect, brings the world of the\nmodern and the recently-obsolete\ncrashing together, making us\nwonder whether the hegemonic\ngrip Facebook et al have on internet\nspace is truly unbreakable.\nBut while the phrase itself\nmay be a blast from the past, the\nshow is anything but. Electronic\nSuperhighway displays the dazzling\narray of ways technology has\ninformed art, and provides us with\na cautionary hope for the future,\nas artists form the vanguard of a\nmovement leading us into a brave\nnew world.\nElectronic Superhighway is at\nWhitechapel Gallery till 15th\nMay.\n\u201cSnowbunny/Lakes\u201d by Cory Arcangel.

We can\nnow see an exponential growth\nin the number of businesses and\norganisations looking to minimise\ntheir local and global harm to the\nenvironment, community, and\nsociety \u2013 aiming to make profits\nwithout compromising future\ngenerations.\nSo why has the response to the\nsustainable business concept been\nso slowly incorporated into many\nbusiness models?\nFirstly, those initial investments\nto incorporate a more efficient\nlower efficiency in the short term.\nSecondly, because few businesses\nact to run sustainably, there is little\nevidence behind statements, such\nas \u201cpositive correlations between\nenvironmental performance and\nbusiness performance\u201d. We thus\nhave a situation where businesses\nhuddle like penguins carrying on\nwith the standard practice, not one\nbusiness wanting to be the first to\nmake that much needed transition.\nHowever, change is finally coming\nabout. The UK\u2019s green economy\nwas estimated to grow by 4.9 to\n5.5% in 2015, with a 48% return\nrate in energy efficient investments\nfor large businesses. Demand for\ngreener products is also seen to be\nincreasing. A lot of this change can\nbe attributed to an increase in public\ndemand for greener products. For\nexample, there is an ever growing\ndemand for meat substitute products\nsuch as Quorn as the environmental\nimpacts of eating meat gain more\nand more notoriety. The shift is\nclearly visible; we now have to pay\nto use plastic bags in supermarkets,\nin an attempt to reduce waste,\nsomething that, a few years ago, was\ngenerally unheard of in the UK.\nJane Courtnell\nScience Editor\nThe elusive green business model\nWhy is it taking so long for businesses to adopt greener strategies?\nThe Adobe headquarters in San Jose, California. Adobe Systems is one of\nAmerica\u2019s greenest companies And it basically provides Adobe Reader for free.\nIt\u2019s an all round corporate nice guy. Photo credit Wikimedia Commons\nAs more and more businesses shift\ntheir business model to a greener\nalternative, there is likely to be a\ndominoeffectleadingtotheforeseen\nexponential increase in \u2018Green\nBusiness\u2019 models. It is important\nthat this change occurs especially\ntechnology, would deter any\ncorporation, especially when the\ntheory is yet to prove itself. I mean,\nwhy would any corporation invest\nmillions for huge organisational\nchanges, when such changes\ncould expose these corporations\nto short term risk associated with\nThis week\u2019s science picture\nNatasha Khaleeq\nWriter\nA plume of smoke wafting from a forest fire in western Colorado, taken by astronauts aboard the ISS. Photo Credit NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\nF\nrom space, Earth is a\nsensational sight often hard\nto grasp because seeing\nwhere all of human history\nhas occurred,can be quite emotional\nand very impactful. As time goes\nby, visible signs of climate change\nstart to appear. Those on land may\nnotice air pollution, deforestation,\nor even rises in temperature and\nsea level. However astronauts are\nthe only ones to bear witness to\nthe mighty destruction of Earth,\nmacroscopically. According the\nMichael Lopez-Alegria (former\nastronaut 1995-2007) they can see\nthe effects of human presence on\nthe planet. For example a different\nhue to the air indicates air pollution\nand contamination. Deforestation\nis also recognisable and so is the\ndecimation of our water reservoir,\nas bodies of water noticeably\nbecoming smaller. Capturing these\nphotos from space allows astronauts\nto raise awareness of the fragility\nof the planet and its ecosystem, to\nthose of us safe at home.\nUK\u2019s green\neconomy\nwas\nestimated\nto grow by\n4.9 to 5.5%\nin 2015\nin developed countries, to set an\nexample for developing countries\nto follow. With intimidating\nthreats from climate change, such\nas loss of natural resources, habitat\ndestruction and species extinctions,\nthere is a need to preserve and work\nwith nature and the environment so\nthat a long term valuable economy\nis maintained.\n\n"

Photo Credit: Lee Thomas\nR\nacism, xenophobia and\nIslamophobia have\nreached a new height\nin light of the \u2018refugeecrisis\u2019 and more recently the sexual\nharassment incidents in Germany\non New Year\u2019s Eve. This Saturday,\nDover saw another big anti-immigration rally by groups like the\nEnglish Defense League, National\nFront, South East Alliance, Britain\nFirst, BNP and UK PEGIDA\n(don\u2019t even try to figure out what\nPEGIDA stands for, the acronym\nFar-right\ngroups\ndescended\non Dover to\nvoice their\n\u201cconcern\u201d\nabout\nnon-white\nimmigration\nFascists\nwere seen\nattacking\neach other\nand their\nown coach\nonly \u201cmakes sense\u201d in German).\nIn September, far-right groups\ndescended on Dover to voice\ntheir \u201cconcern\u201d about nonwhite immigrants. Dover carries\nsymbolism for the far-right as\nthey try to \u201cdefend their shores\u201d\nfrom people who desperately need\nour help and compassion. Groups\nlike Kent Anti-Racism Network\norganised a counter-demo and were\nsupported by many locals and other\nactivists.\nAnti-fascism activists travelled\nto Dover to prevent the neo-Nazis\nfrom marching through Dover.\nIn light of the protests, Section 60\n& 60AA powers were in place in the\nDover district on the Saturday of the\ndemonstration, requiring people to\nremove their face masks and giving\nofficers in uniform the power to\nstop any person and search them for\nweapons or harmful instruments.\nThroughout the day there was\na lot of violent fighting, with the\nriot police failing to keep the two\ngroups from clashing on several\noccasions. This resulted in several\npeople getting hurt, a lot of them\nobtaining head injuries from items\nsuch as bricks being thrown. In the\nbeginning, anti-fascist protesters\nsucceeded in delaying the fascists\u2019\nmarch by containing them at the\nDover Priory station (their starting\npoint). Police eventually escorted\nthe far-right demonstrators to their\nrallying point close to the docks.\nBy this time only a fraction of the\noriginal fascist protesters remained\nto listen.\nViolence had erupted before the\ndemonstration. At a motorway\nservice station in Maidstone on the\nM20 route from London to Dover,\nfive buses organised by the AntiFascist Network (AFN) clashed\nwith a bus of Chelsea Headhunters.\nThese football hooligans are also\nvastly involved with Combat 18\n(18 for AH = Adolf Hitler). A\nfight rapidly started, and escalated,\nwith members of the two groups\nthrowing bricks, wood, and bins\nback and forth, resulting in several\ninjuries.\nThe fascists then went on to attack\na bus of Russian children, before\nthey smashed in one of the anti-fascists coaches\u2019 windshield and\nwindows, and drew swastikas on\ntwo coaches with blood. One of the\ncoach drivers was injured during the\nattacks.\nFascists were seen attacking each\nother and their own coach, once\nmore proving that complete and\nutter idiocy does indeed exist.When\npolice arrived they found a bag of\nknives, nunchucks, knuckledusters\nand other weapons on the fascists\u2019\ncoach and subsequently arrested\nseveral men.\nPolice removed the right-wing\ngroup from the scene and then\ndetained the anti-fascist group on\nthe coaches for almost six hours\nunder Section 1 of the Police\nand Criminal Investigations Act.\nAll passengers had to remain on\nthe coaches and were filmed and\nsearched. Police thereby prevented\nthe AFN coaches from joining the\nrally in Dover and opposing the\nfar-right and their march against\nimmigration. Without the aid of\nthe London AFN coaches the anti-fascists weren\u2019t able to maintain\ntheir blockage of the fascists\u2019 march\nin Dover. To those on the coaches\nit seemed an awful lot like the\npolice detained the AFN coaches\nfor precisely this reason, thereby\nindirectly supporting the fascist\nmarch.\nPeople and property were damaged in clashes. Photo Credit: Twitter/@bat020\nEvery person in Dover or the\nservice station that stood against\nfascism on Saturday could see\nvery clearly what the real threat\nto this country is. It is the angry,\nwhite, middle-aged men in Enoch\nPowell T-shirts and with \u201crefugees\nnot welcome\u201d emblazoned on flags\n(kudos for originality). I know\nit\u2019s hard to take people in ANTIANTIFA hoodies seriously, but\nthe hatred and fear of refugees they\nstand for is spreading across Europe.\nThe left has no problem with free speech\nWe aren\u2019t living in the Orwellian police state as some would have you believe\nJoseph Ronan\nWriter\nKatie Hopkins\u2019 hate speech goes unpunished. Photo Credit: walesonline.co.uk\nF\nreedom of speech is the\nright to speak without\ncensorship or restraint by\nthe government. At least,\nthat\u2019s what Google says. How does\nthe British establishment fare when\nwe look at restrictions on freedom\nof speech?\nAnti-discrimination laws protect\npeople from hate speech.These laws\nlimit freedom of speech for those\nwho aren\u2019t persecuted in exchange\nfor protecting freedom of speech\nfor those who are. The laws prevent\nthe exclusion of minorities and\npersecuted groups,and without such\nprotections a member of a minority\ngroup could easily be frightened into\nsilence by a hostile culture. This is a\nclear-cut example of how political\ncorrectness and freedom of speech\nare not necessarily opposed and can\neven complement one another.\nWe also have regulators. Ofcom\nand IPSO regulate what mass\nmedia can say in order to maintain\na degree of journalistic integrity and\nlegality, and prevent discrimination.\nLast year The Sun spoke of \u201c1\nin 5 Brit Muslims\u2019 sympathy for\njihadis\u201d, based on a survey which\nactually asked if said Muslims had\n\u201csympathy with young Muslims\nwho leave the UK to join fighters\nin Syria\u201d. The question failed to\ndefine which meaning of \u2018sympathy\u2019\nwas meant, and didn\u2019t specify who\nthese fighters may fight for (with no\nmention of the term \u2018jihadi\u2019).\nThis misuse of data was so blatant\nthat the company carrying out the\npoll, Survation, publicly separated\nthemselves from The Sun\u2019s claim.\nIPSO received over 2000 complaints\nabout the article, printed on the 23rd\nNovember 2014, but are yet to give\na ruling.\nThe Sun also found itself in hot\nwaterwhenitprintedKatieHopkin\u2019s\ninfamous article including the line\n\u201cRescue boats? I\u2019d use gunships to\nstop migrants\u201d, which could be seen\nas discriminatory or encouraging\nviolence. It resulted in over 400\ncomplaints to IPSO. This time the\norganisation responded with a firm\nrejection of the complaints in the\nGreer vs The Sun case.\nOn the 11th\nof January 2014 a\nterrorism commentator on Fox\nNews called Birmingham a \u201cno-go\nzone\u201d for non-Muslims. This time,\nOfcom called the incident a \u201cserious\nbreach\u201d and passed a judgement.\nWhat price did Fox News have to\npay? Two apologies.\nAmongst the many claims that\npolitical correctness has gone mad,\nthese three famous cases show\nstate intervention delayed by a\nslow bureaucracy, defending Katie\nHopkins\u2019 words, and requesting\napologies as \u2018punishment\u2019.\nPolitical correctness is discussed\nas some monolith inhibiting free\nspeech it finds offensive, yet Katie\nHopkins, The Sun and Donald\nTrump are safe from its punishment:\na slap on the wrist.\nIf freedom of speech isn\u2019t under\nthreat legally, the claim becomes\nthat left wing PC ideology limits\nit culturally. Let\u2019s take a look at\nleft wing opinions on controversial\ntopics.\nWhat about gender imbalances\nin academia? A product of\nsocietal gender roles, we see men\nencouraged into STEM subjects\nand women into arts subjects by a\nculture depicting men as intelligent\nand women as passionate. There are\nmore arts than STEM graduates\nand, correspondingly, more female\nthan male graduates. If we want\ngender equality in higher education\nthen surely we should tackle the\ngender roles limiting both sexes?\nWhat about discussing the taboo\nsubject of racial imbalances in\nPolitical\ncorrectness\nand\nfreedom\nof speech\nare not\nnecessarily\nopposed\nscholarship grants? In the US,\nwhite students get 75.6% of merit\ngrant funding despite being 61.8%\nof the student population.\nTo balance this there are many\nscholarships prioritising race in\ntheir selection process. With these\ngrants taken in to account, white\nstudents receive 59.3% of funding \u2013\nmuch closer to their 61.8% share of\nthe population.\nRace-specific grants exist to\ncounteract racial imbalances which\nstart earlier in life. A black child in\nAmerica is more likely than a white\nchild to be brought up in poverty\nand have less access to education\neconomic support. If race-specific\ngrants are to become obsolete\nthen surely we need to end racial\ninjustice?\nWhat about the taboo subject of\ncriticising Islam? It\u2019s perfectly fine\nas long as it\u2019s done in a respectful\nmanner and held to the same\nstandards as criticism of any other\nreligion with disrespect sometimes\ncoming in the form of Islamophobia.\nOctober 2014-October 2015 saw\na 47.6% increase in hate crimes\nagainst Muslims compared to the\nsame period the previous year, with\ntriple the number of reports after\nthe Paris attacks.\nHolding other religions as\naccountable as Islam is also\nimportant \u2013 criticism of treatment of\nwomen and LGBT communities in\nMuslim Middle Eastern countries\nshould be mirrored by similar\ncriticism in Christian African\nnations. If we want to discuss Islam,\ncan\u2019t we use the discussion to reflect\non our own culture and mutually\ngrow?\nThe left has no problem with\ndiscussing these issues: gender roles,\nracial injustice and religious freedom\nhave all been commonplace topics\nfor left wing politics for centuries.\nWhat the left takes takes issue\nwith is politics of rhetoric and\ninsults. Katie Hopkins isn\u2019t\ncriticised for breaking unspoken PC\nrules,but for turning a discussion on\nthe social and political impact of the\nrefugee crisis into \u201cshow me bodies\nfloating in water\u2026 I still don\u2019t care\u201d.\nWhen Germaine Greer receives\ncriticism it\u2019s for ignoring discussions\non trans rights and simply claiming\ntransgender women are \u201cnot\nwomen\u201d, not for being un-PC.\nThe modern left doesn\u2019t reject\ndiscussion, it rejects the idea that we\nshould have to put up with hate in\nour political system.\nWhat the\nleft takes\nissue with\nis politics of\nrhetoric and\ninsults\n\n"

What is\nfor sure is that Oldboy represents\njust one film in the blossoming\nworld of modern Korean cinema:\nI\u2019m a Cyborg, But That\u2019s\nOK (2006)\nWhat a name,eh? I\u2019m a Cyborg...\nwas the first film Park released\nafter finishing his \u2018Vengeance\u2019\ntrilogy, of which Oldboy took\ncentre stage. Here, Su-jeong Lim\ngives an electric performance as\nYoung-goon, a factory worker\nwho is sent to a mental hospital\nfor thinking that she is a combat\ncyborg. At the institute she meets\nseveral characters \u00ad\n\u2013 all deranged\nor strange \u2013 including Park Ilsun, played by Korean heartthrob Rain, a man who thinks he\ncan steal souls.\nThe Host (2006)\nI always considered The Host to\nbe the first true \u2018Blockbuster\u2019 film\nto come out of South Korea.Upon\nrelease it sold over 13 million\ntickets domestically.Assuming no\nrepeat viewings that totals 20%\nof the South Korean population.\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why as The\nHost is essentially Korea\u2019s answer\nto Godzilla \u2013 instead featuring a\nmonster lurking in Seoul\u2019s Han\nRiver.\nMemories of Murder\n(2003)\nReleased the same year as\nOldboy, Memories of Murder\nis almost every bit a classic,\nstarring the incredible Kang HoSong as one half of a detective\nteam tasked to solve a string of\nbrutal murders in the Gyeonggi\nprovince. With perfect pacing,\ndeep and engrossing characters\nand a mystery plot every bit as\nshocking as David Fincher\u2019s\nSeven, this film is a must-see.\nBEN COLLIER\nDocumentary corner: Chimpanzee\nBen Collier\nFilm Writer\nO\nh a genuine big-budget\nnature documentary,\"\nI thought excitedly.\nAs a biologist and\nlover of all things primate I was\ninstantly excited to watch this\nfilm upon seeing its name online.\nUnfortunately, my excitement\nquickly flip-flop\u2019d when I saw the\nsecond part of the title: \u2018Disney\nnature\u2019. Expectations dropped\nconsiderably. Disney, as a company,\nhas several connotations which,\nwhilst fitting for children\u2019s cartoons\nand comedies, doesn\u2019t seem to blend\nwell with the themes and tropes of a\nmature nature documentary.\nWhat I was pleasantly surprised\nto find out upon finishing the film\nhowever, is that Chimpanzee does\naway with a very large proportion,\nalthough not all, of its Disney\nbaggage.\nChimpanzee is presented as\na story-driven narrative, and\nthroughout the film we follow a\n3-month old chimpanzee called\n\u2018Oscar\u2019. In the opening scenes we\nhear of his mother\u2019s death and\nsee him separated from his troop.\nUnfortunately, even once reunited\nwith his clan none of the other 35\nmothers are then prepared to \u2018adopt\u2019\nhim. Just before all hope is lost\nhowever an adult male \u2018Freddy\u2019takes\nOscar under his wing.This narrative\nis expertly spun throughout and we\nare able to learn a lot about the life\nof chimps in the Ivory Coast\u2019s Tai\nForest all whilst following the main\nprotagonist\u2019s journey. For example,\nin one short scene where Oscar\nobserves how to crack open nuts\n\u2013 Oscar tries desperately to get to\nthe nuts using logs of wood before\nan adult shows him how to instead\nuse a spiked rock \u2013 we not only\ngain character development, but are\nalso informed of primate learning\nbehaviours.\nIn what I consider to be the big\n\u2018Act 3 showdown\u2019 of the film there\nis a clash between two warring\ntroops of chimpanzees. One is led\nby a battered old alpha-male the\nfilmmakers called \u2018Scar\u2019 and the\nother led by Freddy. The pacing and\nediting here is absolutely superb,\nand as much as I don\u2019t want to\nadmit it I also found myself more\ninvested in the outcome of this clash\nhaving followed the main players\nthroughout the film\u2019s narrative. It is\nhere where the film shines.\nOne issue is persistent however:\nwhilst the looming hand of\nDisney is mostly absent from this\nexperience, Chimpanzee can be,\nat times, anthropomorphic to a\nfault. The narrator often describes\nthe chimps activity in an all-too\nromantic way. Even the labelling\nof the leader of the second clan\nas \u2018Scar\u2019 is a rather obviously\nmanipulative move. Selective\nediting allows the filmmakers to\nspin any narrative they wanted, and\none does often question the reality\nof what is presented on screen. As\nit stands though Chimpanzee still\nserves as an expertly assembled\nand executed look into some\nvery intimate parts of the lives of\nyoung chimps.

Photo Credit: AP\nHollywood and the DuVernayTest\nF\nor the second year running,\nthe Academy Awards has\nnominated only Caucasian\nactors for the awards,\nigniting a powder-keg on social\nmedia, and highlighting the lack\nof diversity in the film world. But\nnot all hope is lost; while actors\nlike Charlotte Rampling and\nJulie Delpy may make misguided\ncomments on the industry, there are\nsigns of real change: Cheryl Boone\nIsaacs, president of the Academy,\nhas stated a move towards changes\nin the membership policy, which\nwould hopefully lead to a more\nrepresentative group choosing the\nwinners; Idris Elba picked up two\nSAG awards, in a pointedly-diverse\nceremony; and the deliberately-titled slave rebellion drama Birth\nof a Nation has won two of the top\nprizes at Sundance.\nIn an article for The New York\nTimes, chief film critic Manohla\nDargis has floated the idea for a\n\u2018DuVernay Test,\u2019 one modelled on\nthe Bechdel Test, and named after\nAva DuVernay,the director of Selma,\nwhose snub at the Oscars was seen as\na crucial indication of Hollywood\u2019s\nproblem with minorities. DuVernay\nherself has endorsed the idea on\nTwitter, although the actual form\nof the test is unclear; while the\nBechdel test merely requires there\nto be two named women characters\nwho speak to each other about\nsomething other than a man,\nDargis just stated that the test\nwould involve: \u2018African-Americans\nand other minorities having fully\nrealized lives rather than serve as\nscenery in white stories.\u2019\nI am sure that there are those who\nwill \u2013 like critics of the Bechdel Test\n\u2013 argue that such motions are merely\n\u2018painting by numbers,\u2019 and wouldn\u2019t\nbe in any way representative of\nthe quality of the film. I would say\nthat such critics have obstinately\nmissed the point of such tests: in a\nUS population that is 51% women\nand nearly 40% non-white, we\nshould expect minority and women\ncharacters to serve as more than\njust a backdrop for the exploits of a\n(white, straight, male) hero.The test\nis not about quality, more about the\nrepresentativeness of the industry.\nThe DuVernay test, as expressed\nby Dargis, brings up two key points.\nThe first is that minority characters\nin films have \u2018fully realized lives,\u2019\nan idea that involves the characters\nbeing named, their thoughts\nexplored, and their portrayal onscreen being nuanced. There is the\nlong-running trope of the black\ncharacter being the first to be killed\nin a horror movie, of the Asian\ncharacter being a maths and science\nwhiz, and of Middle Eastern\nactors inevitably playing a string of\n\u2018terrorist\u2019 roles; but tropes are tropes\nfor a reason, and they reflect the\nlack of fully-developed characters\noffered to minority actors. In one\nepisode of Aziz Ansari\u2019s lauded\nNetflix sitcom Master of None,\nstruggling-actor Dev refuses a role\nthat would require him to put on\nan Indian accent, despite the fact\nthat he was born and grew up in the\nUS \u2013 it\u2019s a common problem many\nminority actors face.\nEven in those roles where\nminority actors have garnered\nacclaim, the range of such roles has\nbeen limited: the first black winner\nof an Oscar, Hattie McDaniel, won\nfor playing a \u2018mammy\u2019 stereotype;\nthe last three black winners of the\nBest Supporting Actress Oscar\nhave won for, respectively, a slave, a\nmaid, and an abusive mother reliant\non welfare. While Birth of a Nation\ndoes, I am sure, deserve its critical\nacclaim, it would be fantastic to see\nroles for minority actors that break\nout of traditional tropes.\nBut there is another issue at\nhand here that the DuVernay Test\nbrings up, not equality of outcome,\nbut equality of opportunity. It is\nall well and good getting annoyed\nwith the Academy, but really what\nwe should be doing is questioning\nand examining the deeper power\nstructures present in the film\nindustry. In order to have more\nminorities being recognized for\ntheir work, they need to have the\nchance of showing off their talent in\nthe first place, something that does\nnot seem to be happening within\nthe current studio system. Often,\nexecutives have given the excuse that\nstories about minorities or women\nAva DuVernay (centre) has supported a new test to encourage wholly developed minority characters in films. Photo Credit: AP/Wikimedia/Sundance Selects\nDuVernay's\nsnub at the\nOscars was\nindicative of\nthe whole\nproblem\nYou can't\nwin awards\nfor roles that\naren't there\nsimply don\u2019t sell. This is clearly a\nlie, as recent releases have proved:\nStraight Outta Compton made more\nthan $200 million, while Star Wars:\nThe Force Awakens, whose two\nprotagonists are black and a woman,\nbecame the highest-grossing film\nof all time in the US. There is now\nno excuse for studio executives to\nrefuse to fund minority films on the\nexcuse that it doesn\u2019t represent a safe\ninvestment.\nFurthermore, many roles that\nmay be filled with minorities are\n\u2018whitewashed,\u2019 with Caucasian\nactors chosen instead. While we\nmay want to kid ourselves that\nwe have left such portrayals like\nMickey Rooney\u2019s grossly-offensive\nturn in Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s in the\npast, we only need to look back a\ncouple of years, to 2013\u2019s The Lone\nRanger in which Johnny Depp plays\na Native American character, to see\nsuch practices are alive and kicking.\nDepp received a fair amount of\nkick-back for his choice to portray a\nNative American, and claimed that\nhe believed he had Native American\nancestry; this has not been proved.\nThe theory of evolution suggests\nto us that change must be gradual,\nincremental, and natural, but the\nrate at which Hollywood is adapting\nitself to its market-demographic is\nachingly slow; despite how much\nthe industry may will it, the USA\nisn\u2019t a homogenous clone-world\nfilled with thousands of Ryan\nGoslings and Emma Stones. The\nfilm industry is sick. While we\nshould rightly criticise the Academy\nfor their refusal to include actors\nlike Idris Elba or Will Smith in\ntheir list of nominees, what the\nDuVernay Test would do is shift the\nattention back towards the root of\nthe problem: the channels of money\nand power that flow through the\nHollywood studios. There are few\nroles out there for minority actors,\nand all-too-often they are shut out\nof potential roles in favour of white\nactors, who offer a more \u2018bankable\u2019\nalternative.\nIn her emotional Emmy\nacceptance speech, Viola Davis said\nthat \"the only thing that separates\nwomen of colour from anyone else\nis opportunity. You cannot win an\nEmmy for roles that are simply\nnot there.\" We should be angry at\nthe industry\u2019s refusal to promote\nminority actors, not only during\nawards season, but throughout all\nstages of film production. What\nwe see when we look at the list of\nnominees for the Oscars is the tip\nof an iceberg of inequality.Tests like\nthe DuVernay Test help shed light\non this, and set out a new path for\nthe future.\nFRED FYLES\n\n"

Within the exhibition\namongst the best of Monet\u2019s work,\nit is easy to see how Monet\u2019s unique\npainting style, from his brushstrokes\nto use of colour was informed by\nhis love of gardening. Only quick\nfrenetic flashes of colour could do\njustice to the sheer mass of leaves\nand petals, and the light filtering\nthrough them that Monet painted.\nIt is undoubtedly Monet\u2019s show.\nNo exhibition on gardens could\nbe complete without Waterlilies or\nJapanese Footbridge, but the strength\nof the curation lies in the fact that\nthe other artists featured give Monet\na run for his money.\nThe Royal Academy\u2019s colourful exhibition brings together gardens of all times and styles\nOne of the standout works of\nthe earlier galleries is Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric\nBazille\u2019s The Terrace at M\u00e9ric; it is\nan unfinished work, but almost\nbetter for it. A ghostly figure of a\nwoman carries in a bench, melting\nin and out of the shadows. In the\nbackground the sunlit path has all\nthe solidity that the figure doesn\u2019t.\nBroad peach strokes clash against\nthe burnt umber of the shade to\ncreate the bright heat of a Turkish\nsummer.\nGustave Caillebotte\u2019s Nasurtium,\npainted in 1880, is one of the few\npaintings in the earlier galleries that\nfeels genuinely revolutionary. Tiny\nsparks of scarlet flowers, engulfed\nby verdant leaves on fragile stems\nare sown without context on a lilac-mauve ground, it provides a bridge\nbetween the realism of the past and\nthe abstractism that would follow.\nThis technique is later amplified\nby Monet in Chrysanthemums, an\nextreme close up transforms the\nflowers into exploding fireworks.\nAlthough the usual suspects\nare Renoir, Pissaro and C\u00e9zanne,\nthere are also works by Gauguin,\nGabriele M\u00fcnter and Paul Klee.\nIt isn\u2019t all bourgeois rural gardens\nreplete with creamy pinks and soft\nblues either. In Garden Study of the\nVickers Children, huge ghostly lilies\nhover over the children with subtle\nmenace. Edvard Munch\u2019s Apple\nTree in the Garden, an homage to\nthe biblical allegory depicted in\nmedieval paintings of gardens,is full\nof lurid lemon yellows, ultramarines\nand sea greens, which clash against\neach other evoking the sinister vein\nthat runs through all of Munch\u2019s\npaintings.\nSantiago Rusi\u00f1ol conjures up a\nfading grandeur in his painting\nof Spanish gardens. In Gardens\nof Monteforte, the golden light\nfrom the setting sun falls through\nwindows cut in hedges and gilds an\nornamental pond. The fiery oranges\nare reflected in the autumnal trees\nin the distance. It is the kind of\nsumptuous imagery that would not\nlook out of place in a big budget\nmovie.\nElsewhere, coming across\nKandinsky\u2019s Murnau Garden II is a\nrevelation. Stylistically, it is so far\nremoved from the paintings that\nsurround it, that it is thrown into\nsharp relief, akin to having icy water\nsplashed in your face (in the best\nway possible). Even from the far\nend of the gallery it is impossible to\nlook away from the splodges of mid\nyellow, cerulean, and scarlet.\nThe Royal Academy rightly\ndevotes much of the final gallery\nspace to Monet.These last paintings\nform the last canvases of his life,\nspanning the years of the First\nThe strength\nof the\ncuration\nlies in the\nfact that the\nother artists\nfeatured\ngive Monet\na run for his\nmoney\nIt is the\nkind of\nsumptuous\nimagery that\nwould not\nlook out of\nplace in a\nbig budget\nmovie\nWassily Kandinsky.

Gone is\nthe pastel prettiness from his earlier\ndepictions of the footbridge, instead\nit is engulfed in flame like brush\nstrokes, lime green, hot orange,\nemerald yellow ochre. Some parts of\nthe canvas are left unpainted, other\nparts are built up in richly textured\nimpasto, almost Braille like, globs of\npaint that dissolve into sculpture the\ncloser you get.\nMonet\u2019s personal grief is palpable;\nhis stepson was drafted as was\nhis son. Though Monet is known\npainting en plein air, in the later\nyears, when he painted on large\nscale canvases, he worked mainly\nin studios from sketches made\noutdoors. Monet was never a simple\ntranscriber of nature, but further\ndegrees of separation of the source\nmaterial combined with his failing\neyesight may have influenced the\nevolution of his style towards the\nabstract.\nThe uncontested highlight of\nthis exhibition is the final gallery\nwhich houses Monet\u2019s Agapanthus\ntriptych, reunited for the first time\nin Europe. The canvases are vast,\npanoramic, and if you stand in just\nthe right place it is possible to fill\nyour entire field of vision with it.\nLilacs dissolve into greens,into blue,\nbroad flat strokes of white suggest\nlily pads.

The course was\nslightly changed due to a \u201csmall\nlake\u201dthat had formed halfway down\nthe originally intended run course.\nThe first run was now lengthened\nslightly to just over 6km with a\nlap around the cycle circuit before\njoining the first half section of the\noriginal run route. The second run\nwas 3.65km and followed the same\nroute but without the lap of the\ncycle circuit. Sandwiched between\nthe two would be eight laps of the\ncycle circuit totalling 20km on the\nbike.\nHowever, the total running\ndistance was unchanged and Matt\nDouthwaite was salivating at the\nthought of being able to reel in his\ncompetitors with his lengthy strides.\nAs the rain started to fall, the race\ngot underway and the field quickly\nspread out with Imperial Triathlon\u2019s\nMilan Misak leading the way closely\nfollowed by Matt. Katie Slater\ntook the lead of the women\u2019s race.\nLily Battershill, Anna Lawson and\nNicola Mason clustered together to\nform a pursuing pack.\nDisaster struck for Milan at\nthe start of the bike leg as he\nstruggled to slip his right foot into\na particularly troublesome cycling\nshoe that refused to stop spinning.\nMatt\u2019s euphoria of taking the lead\nwas short lived though as the fully\nclipped-in power of Milan\u2019s legs was\nable to retake the lead within a few\nseconds.\nBy now the constant drizzle had\nmade the smooth tarmac of the\ncircuit even slicker. This posed a\ngreater challenge to the competitors\non a course that could already be\ndescribed as \u2018quite technical\u2019 with\nplenty of bends and sharp corners.\nSurprisingly, there were no major\nincidences, although Katie did\nadmit to misjudging a corner and\nveering onto the grass for a brief\nmoment. She kept her composure,\nand more importantly her lead. The\npursuing pack had dispersed and she\nnow had Nicola hot on her heels.\nNearing the end of the bike leg,\nMatt\u2019s \u201crunner\u2019s legs\u201d were unable\nto hold onto second place and he\nwas overtaken by a triathlete from\nTunbridge Wells Triathlon Club.\nHowever, Matt\u2019s sneaky tactic of\nsimply not changing his shoes\nbetween bike and run during\ntransition enabled him to quickly\nThe whole gang.

Katie was the first\nfemale to finish in a time of 1:25:09\nfollowed by Nicola (1:26:09) and\nLily (1:28:46) to complete an\nImperial 123.\nElsewhere on the course, Miguel\nPereira, whose muscles apparently\nstill ached from his impressive\nperformance at the GO TRI\nVelopark Duathlon earlier in\nthe week, put in another equally\nimpressive performance to finish\nin a time of 1:18:19.

Schools can choose to\nrun AS Levels alongside teaching\nfor A Levels, but it is predicted\nthat many will do away with AS to\nconcentrate on teaching the full two\nyear qualification.\nCambridge has long been against\nthe reforms. In November 2014, the\nuniversity wrote to schools and sixth\nforms in England asking them not\ndo away with AS Levels, since they\nare used by admissions tutors to\npredict how well a student will do.\nInterestingly, the correlation is not\nseen when predicting outcomes for\na Maths qualification.\nThe assessments will be unique\nto each subject, with some being\nsat before interviews in November\non the same day as similar tests for\nOxford, and others with shorter\ntests conducted at the interview.\nThe tests will be taken by\nstudents applying for 2017 entry, so\napplicants sending off their UCAS\nforms this September will have to\ntake the tests to be considered for\ninterview.\nCambridge University\u2019s new\nDirector of Admissions across\ncolleges said that this move was\nin response to teacher and student\nfeedback, as well as to \u201cmaintain\nthe effectiveness and fairness of our\nadmissions system\u201d.\nPeter Lampl of the Sutton Trust,\na charity addressing educational\ndisadvantage, has said any\nsimplication of the process of\napplying to Cambridge is a good\nthing, but warned that: \u201ctests could\npresent a disadvantage for low-and\nmiddle-income students as there is\na thriving market in private tuition\nfor the extra admissions tests.\u201d\nThe tests\nwill be taken\nby students\napplying for\n2017 entry\nGrace Rahman\nEditor-in-Chief\n...continued from front page\n\u201c...and its willingness to work with\nthe RAG committee to make sure\nthis year\u2019s RAG Week is a success.\u201d\nThe union has told the Raising\nand Giving society that they can\ndistribute a revised version of the\nmagazine only if the offending page\nis replaced with an advert for the\nunion\u2019s own upcoming elections.\nThe union has also offered to\nreprint it, which would allow the\nnew magazine to be distributed by\nMonday. RAG are likely to take\nthem up on this offer,having already\nlost several days of promotion for\nnext week\u2019s events.\nRAG told FELIX: \u201cEvery year\nRAG issues it\u2019s RAG Mag, which\nis designed to be a funny but\ncontroversial magazine which\npromotes our great RAG Events\u201d.\n\u201cIn the past it\u2019s made fun of\nnatural disasters and human\ntragedies, this year the call was\nmade to print a satirical piece about\nLucinda, as such the union feels\nthat this overstepped the mark, and\nas such the union made the call to\nstop distribution of RAG Mags\nacross campus\u201d.\n\u201cThis is disappointing as it\u2019s one\nof our key methods of publicity.The\nunion have since replied that they\nare willing to pay the cost to reprint\nthe magazines, under the condition\nthat the offending article is replaced\nby a leadership election ad.\u201d\nRAG mags have a history of\ncausing controversy, with several\nin Imperial\u2019s history being banned\nfor bad taste, racism and to avoid\ndamaging the reputation of the\ncollege. In 1987, the president\nof CGCU said that year\u2019s RAG\nmag ban was necessary to prevent\nImperial becoming \u201cmore renowned\nfor it\u2019s obscenities than its\nexcellence\u201d.\nThis year RAG are raising money\nfor Great Ormond Street Hospital,\nthe British Refugee Council\nand Porridge and Rice, a charity\nproviding food and educational\nresources for children in a slum in\nNairobi.\nGRACE RAHMAN\n...continued from front page\n\u201cThe dialogue [with college] is\nsuch that there can be no more\nnegatives surrounding alcohol\nwithout risking the SU and our\nseparate clubs and societies\u201d.\nIn the eyes of the law, Imperial\nonly has one student union, and\nICSMSU is a constituent union\nof ICU. However, at the moment,\nICSMSUdoeshavesomeautonomy,\nwith its own separate clubs,societies\nand sports teams and a sabbatical\npresident paid for by the faculty.\nSome concern also seems to\nsurround what a negative medics\nstorycoulddofortheplightofJunior\nDoctors.

We\nwill continue to watch our films in\nthe dark,looking straight ahead,just\nas nature intended.\nIf folks\nstart\ndoing this\non the\nbus their\nstuff will get\nstolen\nmaybe I\u2019ll look stupid in ten years\ntime like when we quote people who\nsaid the internet was never going to\ncatch on. If folks start doing this on\nthe bus their stuff will get stolen.\nOne reality\nis not\nenough\nespecially if you suffer from motion\nsickness, but my small glimpse of\nanother reality has me excited for\nthe further advancements we will\nsee in the next few years.One reality\nis not enough, and the games and\nother experiences I\u2019ve played so far\nare incredibly immersive and offer\ninteresting, and innovative, new\nways of interaction.\nF\nor a gaming device to truly\nsucceed it needs a great\nlaunch title. Land\u2019s End,\na virtual reality puzzle\nadventure from the creators of\nMonument Valley, is the game that\nevery owner of the device must play.\nDevelopers Ustwo truly understand\nthe power of the new medium and\nwhere it works best,and they\u2019ve used\nthat knowledge to create something\nthat feels completely new.\nSet over five short chapters and\ndistinct environments, players\nmust help awaken an ancient\ncivilisation.

Filled with\nart and symbolism, it left us in awe,\nas Italian director Paolo Sorrentino\nreflected upon life and death. This\nis partly why Youth is so widely\nanticipated, and also why it has\nreceived merely good or average\nreviews. Youth, however, although\ncontemplating similar themes, is\ndifferent in the sense that it was\nnever intended to be as extravagant.\nInstead, Sorrentino aims for a\nlighter, more straight-forward,\nsimple film. And that\u2019s what most\nhave failed to realise. In the end,\nSorrentino\u2019s touching tragicomedy,\naccompanied by virtuoso acting,\ndeserves more praise than it has\nthus far received.\nYouth is set in an Alpine luxury\nhotel & spa, surrounded by breathtaking scenery, where retired\ncomposer Fred Ballinger (Michael\nCaine), best remembered for his\nSimple Songs, is spending his\nsummer vacation with best friend\nMick Boyle (Harvey Keitel) and\ndaughter-assistant Lena (Rachel\nWeisz). Fred, fantastically portrayed\nby Michael Caine, is an apathetic,\nsomewhat cynical old man who\navoids any emotional contact,\nleading his daughter to resent him.\nFred thinks that \"emotions are\noverrated,\" preferring to express\nhimself through his music.Later-on\nin the film however, a more tender\nside of Fred is progressively revealed:\nsomeone who cares deeply for his\ndaughter, largely appreciates Mick\u2019s\nfriendship, and, most significantly,\nwho terribly, desperately misses\nhis wife, Melanie, ceasing to find\nmeaning in life without her.\nMick, on the other hand, is more\nsensitive. A widely recognised, but\nnow washed-up film director, he is\nin the process of writing his final\nwork. His \"sentimental, intellectual\nand moral testament\" as he puts\nit, the quite symbolically-titled:\nLife\u2019s Last Day. Mick is writing\nthe film for his old friend, who\nhe greatly admires: Brenda Morel\n(Jane Fonda). Brenda appears in\narresting cameos, reminding us\nwhat a legendary cinema figure Jane\nFonda is. Rachel Weisz also gives an\namazing performance; her character,\nLena Ballinger, is married to Mick\u2019s\nson, who leaves her for\u2026 Paloma\nFaith, playing a caricature of herself.\nSorrentino is known for adding\ncelebrity cameos in his films with\nThe lovely Michael Caine as English composer Fred Ballinger, directing a herd of cows. Photo Credit: StudioCanal/Youth PR\nIoanna Morianou\nFilm Writer\nRepeated\npatterns are\nbeautifully\norchestrated\nby\nSorrentino\nYouth is a masterful reflection of old age\nPaolo Sorrentino\u2019s touching tragicomedy deserves more praise than it has recieved\nquestionable success. Here, Paloma\nFaith\u2019s presence, criticised for being\nshallow and devoid of any meaning,\nis intended to mock today\u2019s popular\nculture and succeeds in doing so.\nIn the hotel, Fred also meets\nand befriends Paul Dano\u2019s Jimmy\nTree, a young actor from California\nwho \u2013 much to his discontent \u2013 is\nmost famous for his portrayal of\nthe robot \u2018Mr Q\u2019. Jimmy seems\ntired with fame and the Hollywood\nactor lifestyle that comes with it.\nHe wants his acting to have a real\nimpact on the world.\nThe film begins with a slowly\nevolving plot, including amusing\nsarcastic casual dialogues between\nCaine and Keitel. A satirical touch\nis also present, like in the numerous\nscenes featuring an overweight\nportrayal of Argentinian footballer\nDiego Maradona. Surreal and\nvisually indulging interventions,\ncommon for Sorrentino, frequently\ninterrupt the plot, such as when\nFred \u2018directs\u2019 a herd of cows in an\nidyllic Swiss scenery.\nThis light atmosphere gradually\ndevelops over a number of fore-shadowings and repeated patterns,\nbeautifully orchestrated by\nSorrentino, to reach a plot-twisting\nclimax of highly unexpected and\ntragic events. All building-up to an\noverwhelming finale, for which the\naudienceisbeingprimedthroughout\nthe film. Fellini-esque scenes, never\nabsent from Sorrentino\u2019s work,\nalso get their moments, the most\ncharacteristic being when Mick\nimagines a meadow full of his\nfemale protagonists; all performing\ntheir roles at the same time,it shows\nthe great impact all these women\nhad in his life, even though he never\ncame to fully understand them.\nOverall \u2013 overlooking the\nPaloma Faith moments \u2013 Youth is\naccompanied by music that fits well\nto its atmosphere; David Lang, with\nwhom Sorrentino has previously\ncollaborated in The Great Beauty,\nhas created a wonderful, fittingly-simple, classical music score.\nThe first time the film\u2019s title\nappears on screen,ironically enough,\nit flashes in front of a perfect row\nof semi-naked elderly women\nmarching towards the hotel\u2019s sauna.\nThis scene emits right from the\nstart a feeling of doom, associated\nwith old age. Ultimately, Youth has a\npessimistic outlook on growing old,\nor rather, a deeply realistic one; it is\nabout aging and the losses that come\nwith it. The loss of a loved one, the\nloss of memory, the loss of purpose\nin life, the loss of enthusiasm and\ntalent. The heaviness of a dull daily\nI\nt\u2019s remarkable how much can\nbe forgiven when you have\na good story. Stylistic flaws\ncan be almost completely\nforgotten about \u2013 when I think\nabout The Lord of the Rings novels,\nit\u2019s not Tolkien\u2019s endless stream of\nminute details that I remember, but\nthe epic quest of Frodo, Sam, and\nthe rest of the Fellowship through\nMiddle Earth. It\u2019s rare enough that\na film with a truly gripping story\n(true or otherwise) arrives, and so\nwhen it does, it may get more praise\nand attention than it deserves as a\nwhole.\nSpotlight is just such a film,\nalthough it has quite the opposite\nflaw that Tolkien\u2019s work does,\nbeing almost devoid of any stylistic\nflourish whatsoever. The soundtrack\nis bland,the cinematography \u2013 while\ncrystal-clear \u2013 is largely devoid of\nany beauty or technical proficiency,\nand with only a few exceptions\n(Mark Ruffalo and Liev Schreiber\ncome to mind),the performances are\nprobably best described as \"solid\" \u2013\nnot necessarily a bad thing, but not\nreally a good thing either (can you\ntell I\u2019m bitter that this film beat\nThe Big Short to the Screen Actors\u2019\nGuild Award for Best Performance\nBy A Cast In A Motion Picture?).\nBut what Spotlight does have going\nThe central cast of Boston-set jornalism drama Spotlight. Photo Credit: Spotlight PR\nroutine.It is about the lustful craving\nof missed sexual experiences, the\nwasting of youth, and the nostalgia\nand melancholy associated with\nold age, the latter being beautifully\nsummed up in Mick\u2019s dialogue with\nhis female screenplay co-writer, as\nshe takes a look through both ends\nof a telescope: \"This is what you see\nwhen you\u2019re young \u2013 everything\nseems really close: that\u2019s the future;\nand now\u2026 that\u2019s what you see when\nyou\u2019re old \u2013 everything seems really\nfar away: that\u2019s the past\".\nYouth is also about simplicity, as\nFred\u2019s \u2018Simple Songs\u2019 reveal; easy\nto play, they are performed by only\na small section of the orchestra.\nNevertheless, as a young boy in\nthe hotel points out to Fred, they\nare \"not only simple, but really\nbeautiful\" too. With the loss of\nyouth comes this appreciation of\nthe simple moments in life that\nshould have been cherished more.\nFor Fred one of them is his wife\nMelanie; as he says, besides all\nthey had been through, they liked\nto think of themselves \u2018as a simple\nsong\u2019. We come to the realisation\nthat emotions are everything but\noverrated; according to Mick, they\nare \"all we\u2019ve got\", and by the end,\nFred finally gives in to them, giving\nthe film it's perfect ending.\nYouth\nDir: Paolo Sorrentino Script: Paolo\nSorrentino Starring: Michael Caine,\nHarvey Keitel, Rachel Weisz, Paul\nDano. 124 minutes.\nSpotlight\nDir: Tom McCarthy Script: Tom\nMcCarthy, Josh Singer.

It tells of the uncovering of\nthe child molestation rife within\nthe Catholic church, and the effect\nit had on its victims, by the four-man Spotlight investigative team of\nthe Boston Globe (Ruffalo, Michael\nKeaton,RachelMcAdamsandBrian\nD\u2019Arcy James), as well as their new,\nquietly brilliant boss (Schreiber).\nThey begin as underdogs facing a\ngiant of a system; as the plot pulses\nalong, more victims are found, more\ndead ends are hit,and the rottenness\nof it all becomes more and more\nclear.\nThe handful of truly excellent\nmoments in the film arrive,\nunsurprisingly, when a glitter\nof craftsmanship appears in the\nfilmmaking \u2013 scenes like the single\nmoving shot in which D\u2019Arcy\nJames\u2019s character walks from his\nfront door for less than fifty metres\nin the dead of night to find himself\nright in front of a rehab centre\nfor child-molesting priests, or a\nheartbreaking sequence in which\nthe sound of children singing \u2018Silent\nNight\u2019 at a carol service is intercut\nwith shots of the victims breaking\ndown as the Spotlight team question\nthem. While I don\u2019t think the\nfilm deserves anywhere near the\namount of recognition it\u2019s getting\n(the nominations of McAdams\nfor supporting actress and director\nTom McCarthy by the Oscars are\njust baffling to me), Spotlight is that\nrare film worth seeing for, and made\nenjoyable by, the strength of its\nsubject matter alone.\nTOM STEPHENS\nWe Come as Friends\nDir: Hubert Saper Script: Hubert\nSaper 110 minutes.\nA\nfter more than a decade\naway, director Hubert\nSauper has returned\nwith We Come as Friends,\na troubling, immensely powerful\nlook at South Sudan, the \u2018World\u2019s\nnewest country,\u2019 whose post-independence existence has been\nblighted by violence. A looping,\nexperimental documentary, We\nCome as Friends draws links between\nthe historical colonialism practiced\nby the French and the British, and\nthe \u2018new colonialism,\u2019represented by\na steady stream of Chinese investors\nand Western interventionists.\nComing out of a 22-year long\ncivil war, and a referendum that\nsaw an overwhelming majority\nopting for independence, South\nSudan emerged in 2011 with a\nsense of hope and joy. But such\naspirations have since turned sour:\nChinese investors have moved into\nthe territory, erecting US-designed\noil rigs; the fertile country attracts\nnumerous foreign businesses; and\nAmerican missionaries joyfully\ndeclare South Sudan \u2018a new Texas\u2019.\nSauper creates a mosaic of\nuneasy scenes; there is no narrative\nvoiceover, but the gaps create\ntheir own story. It is rare to find a\nscene in the film where some form\nof background happening is not\nrelevant: in one, white peacekeepers\ndrink in the new year while a black\nemployee in overalls gathers water;\ntwo scenes feature televisions\nplaying interviews with Hillary\nClinton \u2013 one from 2009 in which\nshe refers to Africa as \u2018the world\u2019s\nbreadbasket\u2019, and one from 2012\nwhere she exploits the legacy of\nWestern colonialism as a weapon\nagainst the Chinese.\nThe civil war has simply continued,\nwith guns and knives replaced by\ndiplomacy and land-agreements.\nImperialism leaves behind what\nFrantz Fanon called \u2018germs of rot,\u2019\nand has re-emerged as a postmodern\nscramble for Africa. With a style\nthat calls to mind the non-linear\nfilms of Adam Curtis, We Come\nas Friends is a vitally-important,\nbeguilingly-strange call to arms for\nall those who reject oppression.\nFRED FYLES\nInnocence of Memories\nDir: Grant Gee. Script: Grant Gee,\nOrhan Pamuk. Starring: Pandora\nColin, Mehmet Ergen. 97 minutes.\nN\nobody has written more\non the changing face of\nIstanbul than Nobelwinning author Orhan\nPamuk. Born in 1952, Pamuk\nhas witnessed an explosion of\npopulation, which has seen Istanbul\nswell to 14 million inhabitants,\nmaking it the largest city in Europe.\nAnd perhaps no book of Pamuk\u2019s\nbetter represents his love of the city\nthan The Museum of Innocence,which\nrecounts a love story over nine years.\nFollowing its publication, Pamuk\ncreated an actual museum, which\nclaims to display objects from the\ncharacters\u2019lives,while also exploring\nUpper-class life in Istanbul.\nThis sense of meta-narrative fits\nin well with the concept for Grant\nGee\u2019s documentary Innocence of\nMemories, in which a camera roams\nthe streets of Istanbul, and a \u2018friend\u2019\nof the main character of the novel\nrecounts the plot of the book.\nDrawing on Walter Benjamin\u2019s\nconcept of the flaneur, we are\ntreated to a nightime walk around\nIstanbul, occasionally happening\non TVs showing interviews with\nPamuk himself, giving us a sense of\nvoyeur-like pleasure. At one point,\nPamuk states that \"the hero of the\nnovel I\u2019m just finishing is a man\nwho continuously walk\" with a glint\nof delicious irony. As memories of\na lived-in city pile up, the screen\nbecomes hazy and opaque, obscured\nby layers of gauze-like shots.\nWhile I don\u2019t know whether the\nfilm would be appealing to someone\nwho is familiar with Pamuk\u2019s work\n\u2013 especially since the film seems to\njust repeat the plot of The Museum\nof Innocence \u2013 those looking for a\ngentle,beautifully-shot introduction\nto the scribe of Istanbul could do a\nlot worse\nFRED FYLES\nNeo-colonialism are explored in Hubert Saper's We Come as Friends.

The team\nwere riding high on the back of\ntheir 305-75 demolition of Sidney\nSussex, Cambridge, but as we all\nknow, there are no easy games in\nthis league.\nThe challenging side from Nuffield\nCollege, Oxford was comprised of\ntwo Americans, a Norwegian and\na South African who were studying\na mix of Economics, Politics,\nand International Relations. A\ncombination which was far too\n\u201cartsy\u201d for their Imperial foes, a\ncollection of three physicists and a\nmathematician.\nThe excitement within the\nspectator arena (FiveSixEight) was\npalpable from the offset, with all\navailable tables being taken well\nbefore kickoff. It was standing\nroom only for the audience as they\nwatched the intellectual gladiators\ndo battle in the arena, with only\nJeremy Paxman to mediate the\nfierce competition that was to ensue.\nA poor start plagued the\nImperial squad, with captain Bezer\nhandicapping the team on the very\nfirst question, buzzing in before\nthe end of the question with the\nMatt Johnston\nNews Editor\nincorrect answer of \u201cHippocrates\u201d.\nMinus five points. No need to panic\nthough, plenty of time left yet.\nThe crowd were anxious to see\na return to form, and the answer\nof \u201cHamster\u201d from Fernando\ndid just that. Woops and cheers\nrang through the union building\nwith the follow up category on\nMathematicians yielding \u201cHilbert\u201d,\n\u201cGodel\u201d and \u201cRiemann\u201d in quick\nsuccession to bring the score back\nto a level playing field of 20-20.\nBezer again decided to try\nand score another slamdunk but\n\u201cM-A-R\u201d turned out to actually be\n\u201cD-A-N\u201d. You win some, you lose\nsome, I guess, and in this case it\nwas another five points conceded.\nRacking up bonus points gave\nNuffield a slender 45-15 lead but it\nreally isn\u2019t over \u2018till it\u2019s over when it\ncomes to University Challenge.\nSupporters watched with baited\nbreath through the rollercoaster of\nemotions that was the following\nquestion. As they heard the word\n\u201cphysics\u201d from Paxman, spirits rose,\nassuming Imperial had it in the bag\nbut subsided again as the Nuffield\ncaptain buzzed in first. Victory was\nsnatched from the jaws of defeat\nhowever, with Fernando calmly\ncollecting the pieces after the\nincorrect \u201cInertia\u201d answer, parrying\nwith the correct \u201cHysteresis\u201d. The\ncrowd erupted in a frenzy unseen\nsince the last ACC sports night.\nBut, what should be lurking round\nthe corner but the apparent Achilles\nheel of the team, literature. With\na bonus round that incorporated\nJane Austen came exchanges of \u201cDo\nyou know?\u201d followed by \u201cI literally\nhave no idea\u201d. A picture round on\nGerman geography brought the\nship back on course, sending the\nscore to 45-40 in Imperial\u2019s favour.\nWhat followed was another\nbreakdown in play as, after Bezer\ngrabbed the starter for ten with\n\u201cBears\u201d, Imperial went on to throw\naway yet more science bonuses.\nChaos occurred in the union as Ben\nFernando wrestled with himself to\nfind the answer on the tip of his\ntongue. But no, he couldn\u2019t convert\nand Bezer wildly lashed out at the\ntarget with \u201cPietro Aronica\u201d, much\nto Fernando\u2019s amusement (it turns\nout he just named a bloke who was\nan ex-University Challenge player\nfor Imperial).The loss of points was\nno laughing matter for the expectant\ncrowd of loyal fans though.\nThe crowd\nerupted in\na frenzy\nunseen\nsince the\nlast ACC\nsports night\nFernando also suffered a flip-flop in these bonuses, deliberating\nover \u201cPeroxide\u201d before settling on\n\u201cEpoxy\u201d. It came up \u201cPeroxide\u201d.The\nscore remained at 55-40.\nThe old adage tells that it\u2019s \u2018a game\nof two halves\u2019 and it certainly was.\nImperial suddenly found a new\ngear after Braude entered the fray,\nupping the score to an 80-40 lead\nwith his clinically precise \u201cKarelia\u201d.\nThe music round came and went\nwith no points scored by anyone,\nindeed with a loss of five for\nImperial after another \u201cPremature\nBezer Buzzer\u201d (which I am reliably\ninformed is a serious medical\ncondition).\nA Feynman quote for Fernando\nwas counteracted by \u201cSudan\u201d,\nand a smattering of extra point\nconversions from Nuffield brought\nthe scores back to a level 85-85.\nCould it be any closer? No.\nBut then\nImperial\ndecided to\nstop toying\nwith them\nBut then Imperial decided to stop\ntoying with them.\nA picture round with female\npolitical leaders, questions\nsurrounding dyes,and a rare flourish\nfrom Teymur with \u201cSlide Rule\u201d\nmeant the quartet were as on fire as\nBen Fernando\u2019s hot pink hoodie.\nA celebratory dance was seen\nfrom Fernando after he netted\n\u201cEllipse\u201d, and Bezer brought home\n\u201cVenus\u201d and \u201cKiloparsec\u201d before the\ngong meaning the team ended on a\n105 point streak. A final score of\n190-85 meant another victory was\nrecorded and Beit Quad was duly\nbouncing.\nPaxman gave a damning post-match analysis, stating to the losers\n\u201cyou didn\u2019t do so well today\u201d. No\nJeremy, no they didn\u2019t.\nImperial will return in their\nsecond quarter final at somepoint.\nThis RAG hoodie was censored too. Photo Credit: Twitter\n\n"

The Immortals knew that\nwith such a strong team like the\nLions, they had to come out firing.\nThe Immortals did just that and\ndespite putting up a phenomenal\nfight the Lions had the edge towards\nthe end of the game and came out\nvictorious with a score of 6-20.\nThe Immortals started the game\nby kicking-off and the defensive\nteam was on. The defense started\nout solidly, having given up some\nyards, and they were able to\neventually force a fourth down\nwithin the red-zone, which brought\nthe offensive team on. A punt was\nrequired after a few plays,as the first\ndrive was unsuccessful. Not so long\nafterwards, a run play executed by\nBirmingham\u2019s offense was stopped\nthrough fantastic teamwork on\nthe Immortals side. This resulted\nin the ball being stripped and an\nambitious run towards the end-zone. Unsurprisingly due to the lack\nof speed given his injury prone leg,\nthe ball was re-fumbled within two\nyards of his run, a \u2018classic linebacker\nthing to do\u2019, thankfully, recovered\nby an Immortal. After a few plays\non offense, it was fourth and inches,\nand instead of a punt, a fantastically\nexecuted rolling maul was\nimplemented instead, gaining a lot\nof yards, going into Birmingham\u2019s\nhalf. The avalanche of Immortals\nO was intensified soon after when\nnewly appointed Quarterback,\nReese Kildem,ran with the ball after\nthe snap, gaining significant yardage\nand earning a first down. This was\nbacked up by penalties going against\nBirmingham\u2019s side, resulting in the\nline of scrimmage moving closer\nand closer to the end zone.\nThe start of the second quarter\nsaw the Immortals getting close\nto getting a touchdown against an\nextremely strong Birmingham side.\nBig man Emanuel \u2018Feast Mode\u2019\nOlagbaju, sprinted closer to the\nend zone, and after a few more\ndowns, Quarterback Race Korma,\ndived bravely getting into the end-zone. All the hard work in that\ndrive by the whole offensive team\nwas rewarded with a much needed\ntouchdown (two point conversion\nwas unsuccessful afterwards). Up\nagainst all odds and criticisms,\nthe Immortals were up 6-0 going\ntowards half time. Veteran wide-receiver Noach Ben-Haim then\nfollowed up this miraculous string\nof plays with a pad-cracking hit\nagainst Birmingham\u2019s receiver upon\nkick-off. The Immortals defense\nwere on point afterwards, with\nthe defensive backs shutting down\nall pass plays and the front seven\nholding off run plays. Birmingham\nwere unable to redeem any points\nending the half with a score of\n6-0. Despite having achieved so\nmuch this game so far, the lack of\nnumbers on the Immortals side was\nan inevitable enemy.The Lions were\nable to take advantage of this weak-point and scored three touchdowns,\none in the third quarter and two in\nthe fourth (two out of the three one\npoint conversions were successful),\nending the game with a score of\n6-20.\nAn amazing effort by all the\nplayers!

Since then,\nit has been relatively rare in the\ninfectious diseases world, with\nonly a few occurrences and minor\noutbreaks in Africa, South East\nAsia, and Oceania. The infection\nitself is fairly short and mild,\ninvolving headaches, joint pains,\npink eye, fever, and rashes. As it has\nbeen uncommon in humans and\nsymptoms generally clear up in ten\ndays with rest and fluids, no cure or\nvaccine has been developed for it.\nHowever, there is now a novel\noutbreak since May 2015 which\nhas seen a sharp parallel rise in\ncases of pregnant women infected\nwith Zika virus and microcephaly\n\u2013 infants born with smaller-than-average heads and underdeveloped\nbrains. Microcephaly can be\npotentially fatal if brain processes\nare not sufficient enough to allow\nfor vital life functions, and even if\nthey survive, they face intellectual\ndisability and developmental delays.\nThe on-going outbreak is centered\nin Brazil and Latin America, with\nBrazil having over 400 confirmed\ncases and investigations of almost\n4,000 on-going. Reports of\noccurrences also extend throughout\nalmost all of the Americas, with\nthe exception of parts of Canada\nand Chile where it is too cold for\nthe mosquito. Cases have also been\nreported in Australia and Ireland of\npeople who have travelled to Zikainfected locations and carried it back\nwith them. It can also be passed on\nsexually from an infected person \u2013 a\ncase of such has just been reported\nin Texas from someone whose\npartner had travelled to Venezuela\nand became infected.\nIn response, the World Health\nOrganisation (WHO) declared\na global public health emergency\non Monday, moving rapidly as a\nresult of previous accusations that\nthey were too slow to react to the\nEbola crisis. This quick action\nallows governments to standardise\nsurveillance of new cases globally,\nand to mobilise funds and research.\nHowever, the WHO has said it\ncould take up to nine months to\ndefinitively prove the link between\nZika and microcephaly, and that\nit was \u201cstrongly suspected but not\nscientifically confirmed\u201d. Control\nstudies will start in the next two\nweeks, which is important since\nW\ne are lucky enough\nto live in the golden\nage of biomedicine,\nwith scientists all\nover the world working to find cures\nfor diseases affecting thousands of\npeople every year.\nThe good news is that institutions\nworking on biomedical research\ntoday are provided with higher\nbudgets than ever before. However,\nthe therapies tackling these diseases\nare becoming more expensive, and\nsubsequently accessible to only\na limited range of patients. The\nsolution to this problem could be\ntranslational research.\nThe basic principle is that the\nNefeli Maria Skoufou\nPapoutsaki\nWriter\nUK universities pair up with Big Pharma\nAcademia forms links with industry to try speed up application of research\nknowledge generated from all these\nyears of research, with biomedicine\nbeing at its zenith, should be\ntranslated to the everyday world of\ncancer,dementia or heart disease,for\nexample.The key behind this idea is\nthe relationship between academia\nand industry. Most of the time,\ndiscoveries made at universities\nprovide important information on\nthe evolution of particular diseases\nand the mechanisms behind them.\nYet, in only a minority of cases\nis this knowledge used to create\na cost-effective cure, available to\neverybody.\nA solution to this discrepancy\nmight come from pharmaceutical\ncompanies themselves, which could\npay the institutions undertaking\nresearch to tackle issues defined by\nthe companies, so that research can\nbe more effective at translating the\nbasic knowledge around a disease\ninto a potential cure.\nThis idea is currently being\nmaterialised in the UK through\nImperial College London, UCL\nand the University of Cambridge\nworking closely together with\nthree pharmaceutical companies,\nAstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline\nand Johnson & Johnson. Imperial\nInnovations, UCL Business\nand Cambridge Enterprise are\nresponsible for commercializing\nthe research of their respective\nuniversities into knowledge that\ncan be used by pharmaceutical\ncompanies to manufacture\nmedicines that can save anywhere\nbetween thousands and millions of\npeople. The so-called \u00a340 million\nApollo Therapeutics Fund was\nannounced on the 25th\nof January, in\nthe hope of approaching these severe\ndiseases from an alternative, more\ninnovative angle that would include\nresearch and industry working close\ntogether towards a common goal.\nThe therapeutic areas of interest are\nnot yet fixed but they will include\nresearch in a broad range of medical\nconditions, such as asthma, cystic\nfibrosis, cancer, diabetes, obesity\nand Alzheimer\u2019s. Scientists behind\nthis consortium believe that in this\nway drugs will be produced faster\nand at a lower cost. Professor James\nStirling,Provost at Imperial College\nLondon, said: \u201cTranslating our\nresearch into benefits for health and\nsociety is at the core of Imperial\u2019s\nmission\u201d. What else, other than\nexciting news and discoveries could\nwe expect to hear when three of\nthe largest global pharmaceutical\ncompanies work together with three\nof the world\u2019s top ten universities?\nA feeding Aedes Aegypti mosquito. Mosquitoes of this genus are responsible for\nthe transmission of the Zika virus. Photo credit Jentavery\nThe Apollo\nFund\u2019s\ntherapeutic\nareas of\ninterest\nare not yet\nfixed\nWomen\nshould\navoid\ngetting\npregnant\nuntil the\nend of\n2017\nwe know very little about the Zika\nvirus because of its rarity in humans.\nA rapid global response by the\nscientific and health community \u2013\ncatalysed by the WHO\u2019s declaration\n\u2013 should let us get ahead of the\nvirus\u2019 spread, which is predicted to\nsee four million cases by the end of\nthe year.\nIf the disease does continue to\nspread and is linked to microcephaly,\nit seems like one of the best options\navailable will also be to just eradicate\nthe Aedes mosquito, which was\nalmost successful in South America\nin the 1960\u2019s.\nStill, some countries have issued\ntravel advisories for pregnant\nwomen not to go to infected areas,\nand even for women to avoid\ngetting pregnant until the end of\n2017. Until we get a grasp on it,\npeople are otherwise advised to take\ncare to prevent mosquito bites and\navoid semen from individuals who\nhave been infected.\nH\nave you ever smelled\nthe air in London?\nWait, stupid question.\nFor those who aren\u2019t\naware, London\u2019s air isn\u2019t the best on\nthe market. Nor is the rest of the\nUK\u2019s.In fact,the UK has been found\nin breach of EU regulations on air\nquality in 16 zones nationwide for\nthe last 15 years.\nIt turns out, the UK\u2019s air has been\nso dirty for so long that the EU is\nconsidering a \u00a3300 million annual\nfine for the government. The affair\nwas described by the European\ncourts as \u201cperhaps the longest\nrunning infringement of EU law in\nhistory.\u201d\nAround July last year, King\u2019s\nCollege London published a\nreport stating around 9,500 people\ndie prematurely, every year, from\nNitrous Dioxide emissions in\nLondon alone and 29,000 in the\nUK (that VW scandal didn\u2019t help\nthings much). With this being the\ncase, and British air pollution being\namongst the worst in the EU, it\u2019s\nno wonder the government can find\nsubstantial money, during a period\nof such austerity, to combat the\nissue. It looks like Newton\u2019s First\nLaw applies to policy too.\nThe UK has just set aside \u00a3600\nmillion, awarding \u00a340 million of it a\nfew weeks ago, from now until 2020\nto scrub clean our British breath.\nThe \u00a340 million had been awarded\nin the name of the Go Ultra Low\nfund: City councils around the\nUK proposed plans to increase the\nuptake of electric cars in their cities\nby residents, those with the best\nideas were awarded funds to push\nRahul Shivaram\nWriter\nBritain gets the push to clean our lungs\nWill \u00a3600 million be enough to help the UK keep any of its COP21 promises?\nahead with plans.\nThe output of the competition was\na selection of four winning cities:\nBristol, Milton Keynes, London\nand Nottingham. Here are some of\nthe nifty ideas as well as the changes\nyou Londoners can come to expect.\nFirst off, the creation of \u2018traffic\npriority\u2019 schemes for Electric\nVehicles (EVs) which allows EVs to\nuse bus lanes 24/7 like normal traffic\nlanes, not a bad bypass. Milton\nKeynes, receiving \u00a39 million has\ngone gung-ho, offering all 20,000\nparking spaces, city-wide, for free to\nEV users. Bristol, given \u00a39 million,\nhas also opened three carpool lanes\nto EV users and is building 80\nfree-to-use rapid charging stations\ncitywide. Also, it offers a four\nweek lease of EVs to introduce\npotential buyers to their cars.\nNottinghamshire and Derbyshire\noffer 13 miles of crucial bus lane,\n230 charge-stations and a business\n\u2018try before you buy scheme\u2019.\nAs for London, our friends Boris\nand co.will use \u00a313 million in a plan\nto convert several boroughs across\nLondon into \u2018Neighbourhoods of\nthe future\u2019.

We were set to\nmiss targets, infringed regularly on\nEU regulations and hadn\u2019t done\nmuch to boost renewables.\nNaturally, the UK on its back\nfoot in Paris, signed up to the Zero\nEmission Vehicles Alliance (ZEV\nAlliance) which has the mission\nstatement: \u201cOnly zero-emissions\nvehicles will be sold in the member\ncountry by 2050.\u201d Bold right?\nOne could even say, it\u2019s the drastic\nchange that should ensure the UK\nheads toward a greener future.\nUnfortunately, just like COP21, it\nwasn\u2019t strongly binding and is more\nof a support group for those who\nwant to make the change.This could\nThe UK\nhas just set\naside \u00a3600\nmillion to\nscrub clean\nour British\nbreath\nexplain why the clean air project is\nless funded than we\u2019d expect.\nA second point worth considering\nis that while the government has\nset aside \u00a3600 million for the clean\nair program, they have been quietly\ndefunding councils and separate\norganisations who are in charge\nof keeping Britain\u2019s air clean (i.e.\nthe Department of Environment,\nFood and Rural Affairs giving less).\nArguably, declining air quality has\nshown how useless local funding\nis but still, funds for certain city\ncouncils have been halved from\n\u00a31 million to \u00a3500 thousand and\ninstead they\u2019ll have to participate in\nprograms such as the Go Ultra Low\nfund, to have a chance of winning\nthem back. Meanwhile, the city\ncouncils who can churn out clever\nproposals will get the funding to go\nahead.\nAll might join in thinking that it\u2019s\na step in the right direction, even\nif they wish the magnitude of the\nstep were a bit larger. Regardless,\nstay tuned for some progress and in\nthe meanwhile, watch out for those\nsilent electric cars!\nparking and traffic priority to\nEVs.

Photo Credit: thedodo.com\nL\nast week Oriel College,\nOxford confirmed\nthat a monument\ncommemorating Cecil\nRhodes, a 19th\ncentury British\nimperialist, would remain despite\na massive movement by students\nseeking the removal of the statue.\nLike many of the students at\nOxford University,I\u2019m disappointed\nby the college\u2019s decision which goes\nagainst the views of the university\u2019s\nstudent union. Rhodes must fall,\nand be moved to a more suitable\nlocation \u2013 the dark and dusty corner\nof a museum.\nOur universities and society are in\ndire need of decolonisation. And I\ndon\u2019t think Oriel College\u2019s decision\nto keep the statue of Rhodes in\nplace while adding what it calls\n\u201cclear historical context to explain\nwhy it is there\u201d goes far enough.\nCecil Rhodes was a tyrant and\na racist, exploiting the people\nof southern Africa through\nthe operations of the British\nWe can\ndo that by\nerecting a\nstatue of\nthose he\nexploited\nSouth Africa Company. Those\nimmortalised in stone are usually\nthe heroes or innovators of our past.\nIn hindsight, Rhodes represents the\nworst of the British empire and by\nremoving the statue we can begin\nto reconcile ourselves with our\ncountry\u2019s dark past.\nSome have argued that as a\nhistorical artefact, removing his\nlikeness is an attempt to \u201ccleanse\nhistory.\u201d What it will actually do\nis \u201crecontextualise iconography\ncelebrating grave injustice,\u201d moving\nand presenting it in a way which\nfully condemns Rhodes\u2019 actions.\nWe should be remembering the\nmillions of victims of the British\nempire \u2013 those who our ancestors\nkilled and enslaved around the word\n\u2013 not the man who subjugated them.\nAnd we can do that by erecting\na statue of those he exploited as a\nreplacement.\nIt\u2019s interesting that so many have\ncome out to attack the Rhodes Must\nFall campaign. The university\u2019s\nchancellor, Lord Patten, suggested\nthat students with such views\n\u201cshould think about being educated\nelsewhere\u201d, and Harry Mount,\nwriting for The Daily Telegraph\n(always the voice of reason),\ndescribed the students taking part\nin the movement as \u201ca generation\nraised to believe that their feelings\nare all that matter\u201d.The real problem\nis their generation; they seem happy\nfor institutional racism to remain.\nUnfortunately, the reaction to\nRhodes Must Fall is part of a\ngreater problem \u2013 Britons are not\neducated about our colonial past. A\nrecent survey by YouGov revealed\nthat a staggering 59% thought the\nBritish Empire was something to be\nproud of. Only 19% said they were\nashamed. On the empire\u2019s legacy,\n49% said countries were better\noff colonised compared with 15%\nbelieving that they were worse off.\nIt seems that Britain is a nation\nMaybe\nImperial\ncould start\nby changing\nit\u2019s name\nof imperial apologists. We should\nnot celebrate the instability we have\nleft behind, destroying once proud\nnations for our own economic gain.\nBritain needs to wake up to the\nfact that the world still continues to\nsuffer from the consequences of the\ncolonial project. By promoting the\nvoices and stories of the oppressed,\nwe can begin to make amends and\nmake students feel welcome at their\nown university.\nMaybe Imperial could start by\nchanging it\u2019s name to something\nthat isn\u2019t a daily reminder of our\ncolonial past.\nThe greatest crime in human history\nAs an intelligent species, we should recognise that eating meat is not natural\nEduardo Conesa-Pietshceck\nWriter\nN\no. If you guessed by\nreading the title that I\nwas going to say warfare,\nyou are wrong. Poverty?\nWe built that ourselves.Famine? Yet\nanother consequence of capitalism.\nThe Holocaust? Although a stigma\nthat will forever stain the history of\nmankind, it did not sustain itself for\nrelatively long. Inquisition? Read\nthe previous. What about, say, the\nfood industry? And moreover, the\ncarnivorous food industry?\nYes, that\u2019s right: mass-slaughter\nof animals. As much as meat eaters\nmay use the excuse, \u201cOh no, but we\nare higher up the food chain and\nsome animals eat others as means\nof feeding\u201d as an argument, this is\nan altogether fallacious one. You\nsee, we as humans should have \u2013\nand in fact it is this very capability\nthat supposedly distinguishes us\nfrom the rest of faunal species \u2013\nintelligence.\nIntelligence allows us to discern\nthe good from bad, the right\nfrom wrong, happy from sad, and\nultimately have mercy \u2013 or at least\npity \u2013 for those in pain. Indeed, it\nis natural for animals to eat other\nanimals but since when did it\nbecome natural to inhibit millions of\nanimals from having their freedom\nby confining them in cells awaiting\ntheir unquestioned demise?\nPigs are desperately squealing,\ncows violently writhing, chicken\nbeing forced to lay unnatural\namountsofeggs,duckshavingastick\njammed in their throats and still\nthere are a handful of shareholders\nprofiting from it. And it is from\ndeath that they profit. Insofar as\nlaws concern, this is legal under\nevery constitution even despite\nhow many non-governmental\norganisations and activist groups\nlobby against it. It may well be legal,\nbut essentially lacks the most basic\nof ethics: humanity. Ah, but when\nit comes to a cute puppy everyone\nfeels empathy and is softened just by\nlooking at a photoshopped picture.\nSadly, there is no stopping this\nforce given that it has gained too\nmuch inertia by today. Meat is now\na staple in everyone\u2019s diet and is even\nentrained within different cultures.\nBy opting to be a vegetarian, one\u2019s\nconscience may remain clean but\nthis does not stop the ruthless\nconsumerism of the society as a\nwhole. Perhaps a good way to part-solve the problem would be to,at the\nvery least, let these animals live in\na somewhat \u201cnatural\u201d environment\nand use less violent methods (some\nsort of short life drug) to butcher\nthem. And of course, decrease the\nvolume of the overall industry by a\ngreat deal.\nPhotographers have a right to capture\nHussain Al-Jabir\nWriter\nI\nt was 3pm on a cold Saturday\nin January. On location at\nAlexandra Palace, a beautiful\nold building atop a hill\noverlooking the London skyline\nin all its splendour. Two friends of\nmine are dressed up for an urban\nphotoshoot, and I\u2019m focussed on\nthe viewfinder, trying to nail the\nperfect shot. Assistants are holding\nreflectors and various bits of\nequipment, perfecting the lighting.\nComposition, check. Lighting,\ncheck. Camera, check. *Click*\u2026.\nshot captured. I\u2019m getting ready to\ntake the next picture\u2026\nOut of the corner of my eye, a\nyellow clad security guard shuffles\nalong purposefully, radio in hand.\nThe whole group lets out a collective\nsigh; we all know the conversation\nthat\u2019s about to take place.\n\u201cHave you got a permit for\nphotography here?\u201d\n\u201cNope we\u2019re just some student\nfriends taking photos in a public\narea, for non-commercial purposes\nonly. Is there a problem?\u201d\n\u201cWell you need to have a permit to\nphotograph in this area, I\u2019m afraid\nyou\u2019ll have to leave, Sir.\u201d\nThis was the third time on\nthat particular day I\u2019d had that\nconversation, and frankly I\u2019m sick\nand tired of it. Over my six years\nof serious photography I\u2019ve lost\ncount of the number of times\nI\u2019ve been stopped, including in\nCanary Wharf, Greenwich Park\nand Westminster Station. I\u2019ve been\ntold not to use a tripod, not to take\npictures of entrances or simply\nto move elsewhere or risk being\narrested. In planning alone for\nmy latest photoshoot, I spent the\nbest part of a month searching for\nappropriate locations and seeking\npermission; this was ultimately\nfruitless given how quickly we were\ntold to leave multiple sites. The\ncreative vision was there, I had the\nequipment ready, the models were\nwilling to take part; but all was at\nstrong risk of being jeopardised for\nlack of an appropriate backdrop.\nI should clarify that legally, all of\nthe locations that we were stopped\nin were private property, and thus\nthe security teams had official rights\nto stop us. However, as we all know,\nwith rights come responsibility, and\nthe indiscriminate and accusative\nbehaviour demonstrated by the\nguards and their superiors is an\nabuse of this right.\nI, along with the vast majority\nof photographers, are socially\nresponsible. We avoid blocking\nentrances, scaring wildlife or taking\nphotos of children without their\nparent\u2019s permission. It therefore\nappears incongruous that we\nshould be subject to photographic\nrestrictions in places which have\npublic access,such as Canary Wharf\nand Alexandra Palace, since we are\nnot harming anyone nor causing\ndamage. perhaps if these security\nguards had read J.S Mill\u2019s \u2018On\nLiberty\u2019, we\u2019d be better off.\nThe fact remains that these\nrestrictions and impositions are\nthreatening our creativity and\nplacing boundaries against our\nimagination and ability to express\nourselves. Numerous times I have\nseen a perfect photo opportunity\n\u2013 perfect lighting upon a sign or\ncolours within a shop \u2013 but have\nthought twice of taking my camera\nout on seeing a guard in the corner\nof my eye.\nOf course, it was all a lot easier\nfifty years ago. Back before the\nthreats of Islamist or IRA terrorism,\nand when Downing Street was\nopen to the public, photography\nwas seen as a benign pastime, and\ncandid images of everyday life were\nperfectly acceptable. Henri CartierBresson, considered the father of\nstreet photography, talked about\nthe importance of capturing \u201cthe\ndecisive moment\u201d to maintain and\nexpress a memory in a shot. He\ntook images in streets and stations,\nof children playing and adults going\nabout their daily lives.This approach\nseems hollow and idealistic in a\nThese\nrestrictions\nand\nimpositions\nare\nthreatening\nour\ncreativity\nDerriere la Gare Saint Lazare: If we took a similar image today, we could be\nunder threat of counter-terrorism laws. Photo Credit: Henri-Cartier-Bresson\nworld where taking photos such as\nhis \u201cDerriere la Gare Saint-Lazare\u201d\ncould allow him to be stopped under\nSection 43 of the Terrorism Act.\nEven more worryingly, in July\n2015, the European Parliament\nvoted on the Right to Panorama,\nan outrageous law which could have\nclassified skyline and building views\nas copyrighted and thus illegal to\nsell without permission. Thankfully\nthis law was defeated in parliament,\nbut indicates the absurd lengths to\nwhich our right to photography is\nunder attack. Public access should\nbe able to be captured by the public\nin all forms; we have no say in\nthe skyscrapers that make up our\nskylines, but are somehow expected\nto defer to their owners when it\ncomes to imaging that which we see\naround us.\nToo many photo opportunities are ruined by\nunnecessary regulations\nNevertheless, London\u2019s youth\ncreative scene is booming. Having\nbeen fortunate enough to collaborate\nwith photographers, musicians,\nmodels and stylists from all over the\ncapital, I am convinced of the sheer\ntalent out there. Young people are\nexcited to be making creative media\nand expressing their opinions of\nthe world around them. But talent\nneeds to be nurtured, encouraged\nand shared; I fear that these onerous,\ntiring and baseless restrictions\nimposed upon us by society will\nsimply cause our creativity to fade\naway. It is this that will be the real\ntragedy \u2013 not the taking of photos\nin public access but privately owned\nland.\n\n"
