However,\nthe challenges facing early\ncareer sustainable scientists\nin their quest to begin this\ncareer path are complex .\nNow, in the third year of my\nPhD, I have begun to explore\nthese challenges along with\nAlexandra Hicken talks to colleagues from the Network of Sustainable Scientists about the\nchallenges that complicate a career in sustainable science.\nLack of a clear career\npath to follow |\nCristiano Verrone,\nPostdoctoral Researcher,\nDTU, Denmark\nWorking in a lab, it is\npossible to be in control\nof the outcome of my own\nwork and this predictability\ncan be nice. In contrast,\nperhaps the most troubling\nthing facing researchers who\nwish to embark in a career\nin sustainable science is its\nunpredictable nature \u2013 it is\nnot currently clear what a\ncareer in sustainable science\nactually entails. \"In other\nscientific disciplines, PhD\nstudents can easily move\ninto industrial research,\nacademia or even unrelated\nfields such as banking, with\nthe path they need to follow\nto achieve these goals being\nwell defined. However, this is\nnot the case with sustainable\nscience. In order to have\nreal impact, it\u2019s important for\nsustainable scientists to be\nable to advise professionals\nin the public and private\nsectors whilst still being able\nto perform interdisciplinary\nresearch. This \u2018dream scenario\u2019 almost certainly does\nnot currently exist for early\ncareer researchers and as\nsuch, it is difficult to know\nwhat steps to take after finishing PhD research.\nA challenge is the inter-and transdisciplinarity\nin sustainable science\n| Daniel Pleissner,\nAssistant Professor,\nLeuphana University of\nL\u00fcneburg, Germany\nDue to the complex problems the world is currently\nfacing, such as an ever\nincreasing population and\nrising levels of pollutants, neither physical and natural nor\nsocial scientists possess the\nskills needed to tackle these\nchallenges in discrete groups.\nBut sadly, training in the form\nof research is usually given in\nvery niche areas and so PhD\nstudents are rarely equipped\nwith the skills to be truly\ninterdisciplinary researchers.\nThe long time needed for\nthe impact of such research\nto manifest itself, at least in\nterms of citations, further\ncomplicates things, despite its\nbroad social and economic\nimpacts. This discrepancy\ncould be mitigated through\nensuring that interdisciplinary\nteams of researchers exist to\ntackle problems together and\nmore importantly, through\nmaking funding available\nto such teams from research\ncouncils.\nLimited role models\nand lack of respect for\nsustainable science field\nin traditional science\nsettings| Natalie\nO\u2019Neil, PhD Student,\nUniversity at Albany\nState, USA\nMany people chose a specific career path as a result\nof the influence of a strong\nrole model. But in sustainable\nsciences there appears to be\nno one to contact for advice\nor support. This lack of role\nmodels in sustainable science\nis cause for concern for early\ncareer researchers. Additionally, sustainable sciences are\noften viewed as a \u2018watered\ndown\u2019 version of science,\nespecially from researches\nin \u2018pure\u2019 scientific disciplines.\nThis further intensifies the feeling of a lack of support from\nsupervisors or the department\nthat they are researching in\norder to continue with sustainable science research.\nFortunately, for many early\ncareer sustainable scientists,\nthe desire to continue along\na career path that may be ill\ndefined and treacherous, but\nallows them to work towards\nachieving a sustainable future,\nis still strong. Working together\nwith other researchers and\nprofessionals as well as\njoining networks to promote\nsustainable science through\nall scientific disciplines is one\nway they can ensure that this\nis the case. Personally, it is\nimportant that I play a role in\nthe promotion of sustainable\nsciences either through my\nresearch in the chemistry\ndepartment, or through\nextra-curricular work as a\nvolunteer for a sustainable\nscience network. Over the\ncoming weeks, NESSE will be\nconducting research into the\nexperiences of early-career\nresearchers wishing to do\nsustainable science in order to\nsee what can be done to help.\nThis will lead to NESSE being\nable to support early-career\nsustainable scientists in order\nto ensure that the challenges\nthey face aren\u2019t faced alone.\n...\n\\\\ My desire to\npursue a career in\nsustainable science\npost-PhD, and to\nensure that my\nresearch efforts\nhave a \u2018wider\nimpact\u2019, outside\nmy niche area of\nchemistry, is as\nstrong as ever \\\\\nthe help of the thoughts of my\nfellow NESSE members.\n\\\\ It is not clear\nwhat a career in\nsustainable science\nactually entails \\\\\n\\\\ mattwalker69\n\\\\ U.S. Department of Agriculture\n\n"

However, given there\nare so many variants, it\u2019s sometimes\nhard to pick the best from the bad \u2013\nso we\u2019re here to help.\nT\nhe hipster revolution\nis upon us. No\nfood is safe. The\nhumble burger has\nbeen embellished\nwith a bright\ngreen avocado bun. If\nyou haven\u2019t tried kale or\nquinoa (pronounced \u201ckeenwah\u201d, trust me, I have\nbeen corrected multiple\ntimes), frankly, where\nhave you been? Although\nthe occasional twists on\ntraditional dishes are\nwelcome, food fads are\noften the products of bored\npeople with well-groomed\nbeards and usually die out in\na matter of months. Many try\ntoo hard to be alternative and\nlose sight of the practicalities\nof eating. \u201cDeconstructed\u201d\nspaghetti bolognese out of\nmason jars anyone? And let\u2019s\nface it, bread served in hats is\nsimply unhygienic.\nHowever, some food\nfads catch on and become\nmainstream. The earliest\nknown variation of modern\npizza originated in Naples.\nSince then this world-wide\ndelicacy has adapted to a\nvariety of taste buds, which\nhas resulted in long running\nfeuds over which type is\nbest. In the USA alone the\nfamous Chicago deep-dish\nis in competition with the\nNew York-style thin slice.\nAcross London the Franco\nManca pizza chain, popular\nwith Imperial students, is\nknown for its delicious and\nsurprisingly affordable\nsourdough pizzas. As the\ndaughter of a baker who has\ngrown up with the smell of\nAlice Davage\nhomemade sourdough bread\nwafting through the house,\nthese pizzas are a particular\nfavourite of mine. In my own\nkitchen I have heard far too\nmany arguments about pizza,\nyou wouldn\u2019t think it could be\na controversial topic, and yet\nwhether a Hawaiian is a monstrosity or not is an ongoing\ndebate. So naturally when\nit comes to pizza trends any\ndeviations from the norm are\nessentially marmite \u2013 you\u2019re\neither going to love them or\nhate them.\nA few months ago while\naimlessly wandering around\nSoho with rumbling stomachs,\na friend and I stumbled across\na place called Flat Planet.\nUpon inspection we had\nfound a hipster gem. But in\na good way. Now this place\nis littered with hipster d\u00e9cor,\nfeaturing classic exposed\nEdison light bulbs, thoroughly\ndoodled walls and a rather\nendearing piano named Tom\nwith a \u201cplay me\u201d sign. If Flat\nPlanet was all style and no\nsubstance then it would have\nbeen a disappointment. But\nluckily the food was great\ntoo. Their speciality is flat\nbreads if you didn\u2019t guess\nfrom the name. What struck\nme most was that the menu\nincluded some topping combinations that are different\nto the classic pizza choices. I\nfound my Moroccan flatbread\nwith houmous, labneh (a type\nof yogurt), tomatoes, olives,\nbasil, mint and rose harissa\nto be a refreshing alternative\nto my usual pepperoni pizza.\nThe flatbreads are also lighter\nthan most pizzas, which make\nthem a perfect light-ish lunch.\nPizzas that could definitely\nnever be considered light\nare the 20\u02dd giants served at\nHomeslice. The use of paper\nplates and the fact that these\nwonderful creations barely fit\non the table, meaning I was\nessentially eating off my lap,\nmade for a more casual fam-ily-style eating experience,\nwhere ordering more if you\u2019re\nhungry is encouraged and\nperfectly feasible considering\nhow quickly the pizzas arrive\nafter ordering. But what if\nyou don\u2019t all want the same\ntopping? Not a problem.\nThere is the option to have\nhalf one type of pizza and\na different one on the other\nhalf! Although this does make\nthe pizzas incredibly artsy\nlooking, a plus for any avid\ninstagrammers and snapchat-ters out there, it essentially\nmeans that you have combined two regular sized ones\ninto a more impractical 20\u02dd.\nBut hey, this is definitely more\nfun and a nice change for\npeople looking for something\nout of the ordinary.\nThe choice of toppings are\ngreat too. For once, vegetarians are not subjected to only\ntwo choices, a boring margherita or vegetarian option that\nno matter where you order it\nfrom always seems to include\nthe same 5 vegetables and\noverdoes it on the sweetcorn.\nThere has been a gap in the\nmarket for more exciting\nvegetarian pizzas for a while\nand I believe Homeslice may\nbe the answer. Some of the\nvegetarian options include\ninnovative toppings such as\ncauliflower cheese, butternut\npumpkin and broccoli, ingredients you wouldn\u2019t normally\nassociate with pizza.\nHomeslice also switch things\nup in another way. Their\npizzas come with a range\nof sauce favours instead of\njust the classic tomato. This\nincludes the rich red wine\nsauce lined base used with\ntheir venison and kale pizza.\nTo put it simply, it was divine.\nNaturally drinking wine to\naccompany pizza tastes\ngreat, possibly a match made\nin heaven in fact, but who\nwould think to put the alcohol\non the pizza instead? For the\npeople who aren\u2019t in love\nwith the flavour of red wine,\nHomeslice also offer other\ninteresting tomato sauce alter-natives, such as sweetcorn\npur\u00e9e and garlic.\nThe archetypal standard\nround pizza with cheese and\ntomato sauce is irreplaceable\nand will always hold a place\nin my heart. But sourdough,\nflatbread and unusually large\npizzas are variations I can\nget on board with. Someone\nhad to come up with a crazy\nspark of genius for all the\nfoods we enjoy today to be\ninvented in the first place. But\nequally if you chose to stick to\nDomino\u2019s, then fair enough, I\nwon\u2019t judge (much).\n\\\\ Flat Planet is\nlittered with hipster\nd\u00e9cor, featuring\nclassic exposed\nEdison light bulbs,\nthoroughly doodled\nwalls and a rather\nendearing piano\nnamed Tom with a\n\u201cplay me\u201d sign \\\\\n\n"

But what\nexactly is causing the decline?\nOngoing research at Imperial\nand worldwide has cited pesticides as a leading factor of\nbee decline. Climate change,\nmites, and disease have also\nbeen investigated as possible\ncauses.

And it\nwas hard (no pun intended,\nin fact, it was exactly the\nopposite)! Somehow, I\u2019ve\naccidentally trained myself\nto get turned on immediately\nwhen I look at porn, and\nsimultaneously managed to\nforget how to masturbate\nwithout it, which has the\npotential to be more than a\nlittle frustrating when paired\nwith the unreliable battery in\nmy aging iPhone.\nI like porn (which may be\nobvious from the above state-ment), and I think that it has\na place in anyone\u2019s sex life, if\nthey want it to. Although porn\nsex is frequently unrealistic,\nonce you\u2019re past early teen-agerhood and have a more\npragmatic view of what sex is\nand isn\u2019t like in reality, it can\nbe a great way to explore\ndifferent things, and find\nout what you do and don\u2019t\nlike. And it can just be really\nfucking hot, which is always\ngood in a source of visual\nentertainment.\nBut is it bad for you? There\u2019s\na lot of crackpot shit on the\ninternet about how stopping\nwatching porn will make you\ntaller, less angry, have clearer\nskin, and somehow will make\nyou less submissive to the Illuminati. It\u2019s also cited as giving\nyou \u201cdestructive erections\u201d,\nbetter dream recollection,\nand an urge to expand your\nmind.

As\nwell as restricting the way\nwe get ourselves off, this can\ntranslate into problems in\nyour wider sex life.\nThere\u2019s a growing movement against any use of porn\nfor masturbation, and I don\u2019t\njust mean amongst the creepy\npick-up artistry toting neck-beards occupying the NoFap\nforums on reddit. I don\u2019t know\nif that\u2019s completely necessary,\nbut I think it is important to be\naware of how your thought\nprocesses can be affected by\nwhat you\u2019re choosing to wank\nto. In the same way that mas-turbatory reconditioning is a\ndisturbing technique used to\n\u2018cure\u2019 homosexual tendencies\nand \u2018retrain\u2019 \u2018correct\u2019 desires,\nthe same principle applies\nwhen you consistently masturbate to certain imagery.\nIn a classic Pavlovian way,\nyou become conditioned to\nbecome turned on only by\nporn \u2013 a learned behaviour\nthat can manifest as discernible neurological changes.\nPorn sex can frequently be\nviolent and problematic, and\nteaching yourself only to be\naroused by this imagery could\nlead to some questionable\nbehaviours down the line in\n\\\\ Not watching\nporn will make you\nless submissive to the\nIlluminati \\\\\n\\\\ Brainwashing\nyourself into enjoying anything exclusively sounds like a\nrisky manoeuvre \\\\\na desperate quest for satisfaction with a partner (which\nis fine, if that\u2019s what they\u2019re\nalso into, but not so much if\nthey want to explore a more\nvaried diet).\nBrainwashing yourself\ninto enjoying any one thing\nexclusively sounds like a risky\nmanoeuvre in any case, and\none that\u2019s best avoided. This\ncan mean curating your porn\nhabit by varying the content,\nand maybe sometimes\nmaking that content come\nstraight from your mind.\nIt\u2019s like those brain training\ngames, only a little more fun!\nYou\u2019re definitely going to get\na first if even your wanking\ntime is being used to develop\nyour cognitive abilities.\nI don\u2019t think that we need to\nbreak the porn habit entirely,\nbut maybe occasionally try\nand do something different:\ntry a new butt plug, hang\nupside down from the ceiling,\nbut most importantly, use your\nimagination.\n\\\\ Porn makes it\neasy to rapidly alleviate the physical\nsexual frustration,\nand who wants to\nmake time for pleasuring themselves in\ntheir busy lifestyle?\\\\\nDON\u2019T COM IN !\nWould you like\nsome pizza?\n\n"

Blah.Blah.Blah\nfelixonline.co. uk /comment comment.felix@ic.ac.uk\nPutin has a\nhuge power\nhard on\nCharles Titmuss explains why Putin is\nprobably ecstatic right now\nF\nrom his images in\nNational Media (and\nyes, those do require\ncapital letters), it\u2019s\nclear that Vladimir\nVladimirovich Putin\nhas a hard on for one man:\nhimself. Whether he\u2019s shirtless\nfishing, riding a horse, or\nkilling a bear with his bare\nhands, Putin\u2019s got a thing for\nbeing the manliest manly\nRussian man around. And\nright now he has the added\nadvantage of being the\nshrewdest and luckiest foreign\npolicy operator in the world.\nRussian foreign policy for\nthe last 20 years has been\none of resurgence. Russia\nhas been a major player in\nEurope since the 18th\nCentury\nwith the establishment of the\nRussian Empire, and was a\nmajor player in the Napoleonic Wars in the early\n1800s, the Crimean War,\nand numerous wars against\nthe Ottoman and Persian\nEmpires. At the start of the\n20th\ncentury, Russia initiated\nthe Russo-Japanese War and\ntook part in the First World\nWar. In 1917, the Soviet\nUnion was created, and the\nEmpire became the USSR.\nThe Soviet Union would\nallow Russia to project its\npower worldwide like never\nbefore, defeating Nazi Germany, and engaging with the\nUS in the Cold War. Following the collapse of the Berlin\nwall in 1989, and the subsequent collapse of the USSR\nand its economy, Russia has\nbeen comparatively weak.\nThis is the historic hangover\nthat Putin is operating with:\nhe wants to re-elevate Russia\nback to the superpower status\nthat it once possessed. With\nthis goal of international\ninfluence in mind, it is possible to consider Putin to be\narguably one of the world\u2019s\nmost skilled international\npoliticians and certainly one\n\\\\ Through a combination\nof good luck and shrewd\nforeign policydecisions, Putin\nis in a great place \\\\\nof the luckiest. Despite eco-nomic, social and political\nturmoil, somehow Putin has\nmanaged to surf the wave\nand get to the beach shirtless and smug as hell. Russian\ninfluence and prevalence in\nforeign policy is at the forefront of everyday life, more\nso than at any time for the\npast two decades.\nTo support such a bold\nassertion, it is critical to look\nat Russian foreign efforts:\nPutin has managed to pull\noff the first successful military intervention in a Middle\nEastern country by a foreign\npower in living memory. By\nsupporting the Assad regime,\nan established force in Syria\nwith significant local support,\nPutin has been able to maintain Russian influence in the\nregion, as well as humiliate\nthe West in its rather pathetic\nand non-committal effort to\nsupport the rebellion. Putin\nhas also been able to manipulate the presence of so-called\nIslamic state to give his brutal\ncampaign and the Assad\nregime some legitimacy. Air\nstrikes are always conducted\nagainst \u2018terrorists\u2019, which is\napparently anyone that has\nan objection to being indiscriminately bombarded and\ngassed.\nThe war in Syria has also\nhad a possibly unforeseen\nbenefit for Russia the refugee crisis. Nearly five million\npeople have been displaced\ninternationally as a result of\nthe civil war, sparking the\nmigrant crisis for the EU and\nsignificantly impacting international relations between\nits members. Countries such\nas Greece, Hungary and\nRomania have had to bear\nthe brunt of this, which has\nled to increased tension\nbetween nations in Western\nand Northern Europe that\nhave tried and succeeded to\ndodge sharing the burden. It\nhas also led to the increased\n\\\\ Trump is\nunashamedly pro-Russian, presumably\nbecause one\nwould-be tyrant\nappreciates another,\nactual tyrant \\\\\npopularity of anti-EU and\nmigrant demagogues, threatening the break-up of the\nEU. The EU is a significant\neconomic opposition force\nto Russia with members that\nwere once a part of the USSR\neconomic sphere. Any weakening of this coalition is to\nRussia\u2019s benefit.\nSpeaking of foreign wars,\nlet\u2019s not forget Ukraine.\nFollowing the Orange Revolution and the establishment\nof Petro Poroshenko, Russia\nhas decided to gently use\nmilitary coercion to bring\nthe nation back into the fold.\nThis bears some similarity to\nthe invasion of Georgia, or\nthe subjugation of Chechnya. Russia annexed the\nCrimea and is currently fighting a clandestine war in the\nDonetsk region in order to\ndestabilise the pro-western\nregime. The preoccupation\nof western media with Senor\nTrump has allowed the\nincreasing violence of this\nwar to go almost unnoticed.\nFinally, there is El Trumpo\nhimself. He is unashamedly\npro-Russian, as are members of his advisory council,\npresumably because one\nwould-be tyrant appreciates\nanother, actual tyrant. Putin\nno longer has to worry quite\nso much about things such\nas sanctions that would be\nalmost guaranteed under the\nObama administration. Some\nof those sanctions previously\nimposed may be lifted in\norder to cement the collaboration between the White\nHouse and the Kremlin.\nSo all in all, through a\ncombination of good luck\nand shrewd foreign policy\ndecisions, Putin is in a great\nplace. Despite the challenges\nto the Russian economy, he\nhas been able to expand\nRussian hegemony interna-tionally, and is now in an\nexcellent position to continue\nto do so: the US and EU,\npreviously major opponents\nto Russian expansion, have\neither been rendered friendly\nor are preoccupied with internal political problems, and\nRussian military prestige is at\n\\\\ The US and the\nEU, previously major\nopponents to Russian\nexpansion, have\neither been rendered\nfriendly or are\npreoccupied\\\\\nan all-time high following the\nsuccessful stabilisation of the\nAssad regime. The question\nof 'where next?' is an important one. Latvia, Lithuania\nand Estonia are all previous\ncomponents of the Russian\nEmpire, and have large\nnative Russian populations,\nperfect for another uprising\nsituation as in Ukraine. However, these nations are NATO\nallies, so such a move could\nbe disastrous for Russia and\nthe world. We shall have to\nwait and see.\n\n"

The scorn that\nthis combination provokes\non the right of the political\nspectrum is telling \u2013 for too\nlong, environmentalism has\nbeen seen as detached, and\neven beyond politics: a fringe\ninterest, something best left\nto millionaire celebrities with\na guilty conscience. Global\nwarming is often treated as if\nit were a catastrophe that we\nhave no control over, with our\nonly hope being some miracle\nof technology. This could\nnot be further from the truth;\nclimate change is emphatically\nnot like an asteroid heading\ntowards Earth \u2013 rather, it is the\ndirect result of the way that\nwe choose to organise our\nsocieties and our economies.\nThe challenge that climate\nchange poses is neither\nscientific nor technological,\nbut political.\nViewing climate change in\nthis way is crucial as it shapes\nthe kinds of solutions that we\nlook for. If we choose to see\nglobal warming as an entirely\ntechnological problem, then\nwe invite only technological\nsolutions. Accordingly,\ngeoengineering \u2013 large-scale\nhuman intervention in the\nclimate system in an attempt to\nreduce warming \u2013 has grown\nover recent decades from a\nfringe research interest to a\nleading proposed method of\nmitigating climate change.\nVarious different flavours\nof geoengineering have\nbeen put forward, ranging\nfrom the seemingly benign\nto the downright reckless.\nAn infamous example of the\nlatter is the proposal of Nobel\nLaureate Paul Crutzen to\nlaunch parcels of sulphur into\nthe high atmosphere using\nartillery guns. Sulphur reflects\nsunlight, and the project\nwould almost certainly lead to\na cooling of the atmosphere\nsimilar to the aftermath of\na volcanic eruption. But it\u2019s\nunlikely that this would be\nthe only effect \u2013 even small\nvolcanic eruptions often\ndrastically alter rainfall\npatterns, destroying crops\nand causing extreme weather;\nthe effects due to a project\nof Crutzen\u2019s scale could be\neven more serious. As if this\nwere not enough, sulphur\nin the atmosphere is known\nto destroy the ozone layer,\npotentially exposing us to\ngreater levels of harmful UV\nradiation from the Sun. It\u2019s\nhard to avoid feeling that the\nwhole project would be akin\nto pinching yourself to cure a\nheadache \u2013 with that many\ndire consequences, global\nwarming would probably be\nthe least of our worries.\nIt\u2019s perhaps unfair of me to\npick the worst example of\ngeoengineering, and that\u2019s\nnot really the aim of this\narticle. The problem with\ngeoengineering is not so\nthese quick-fixes become\nincreasingly attractive to a\ncorporate and political class\nreluctant to alter the economic\nstatus quo. In the words of\nthe political theorist Frederic\nJameson, it\u2019s become \u201ceasier\nto imagine the end of the world\nthan the end of capitalism\u201d.\nClimate change is not so\nmuch a crisis of science, then,\nas a crisis of capitalism. It lays\nbare the central lie at the heart\nof the capitalist economy \u2013\nthat we are nothing more\nthan individuals looking to\noutcompete each other, rather\nthan social animals who all\nhave a vested interest in the\nfate of our shared planet.\nClimate change also reminds\nus that economics does not\nexist in a vacuum; our actions\nhave material consequences,\nand even if right now those\nconsequences seem far\naway from rainy London and\nWestern Europe, it won\u2019t be\nlong before we all feel their\neffects. Ultimately, carbon\ndoes not respect national\nborders.\nIf we are to be serious about\navoiding climate change,\nthen switching off lights won\u2019t\ncut it: we must be prepared\nto radically alter the way we\nstructure our societies and\nour economies. It will involve\na wholesale change of what\nwe deem to be economically\nimportant; striving for infinite\ngrowth on a finite planet,\nfor example, is a game that\nwe\u2019re destined to lose. The\npriority must be to fairly\ndistribute the planet\u2019s wealth\namong its seven billion\ninhabitants, accounting for the\nfact that often the countries\nlikely to bear the brunt of\nclimate change are the least\nequipped to do so. Limiting\nglobal temperature rise to\nmanageable levels will require\nthat the majority of known\nfossil fuel reserves stay in the\nground. We cannot gamble\non fossil fuel companies doing\nthis through the goodness of\ntheir own hearts. These are the\npeople, after all, who would\nsooner trade the future of the\nplanet for a quick buck than\nlose their place at the top of\nthe economic tree.\nAs long as our economic\nsystem sacrifices sustainability\nin pursuit of short-term\nprofits, we throw away our\nbest chance of avoiding\ndevastating climate change.\nEnvironmentalism and\nprogressive politics are two\nsides of the same coin \u2013 red\nwithout green is myopic;\ngreen without red is toothless.\nPerhaps, then, it\u2019s time we\nall embraced watermelon\npolitics.\n\\\\ For too long,\nenvironmentalism\nhas been seen as\ndetached, and\neven beyond\npolitics \\\\\n\\\\ Geoengineering\nhas from a fringe\nresearch interest to\na leading proposed\nmethod of\nmitigating climate\nchange \\\\\nmuch that it\u2019s always bad, but\nthat by relying on it to save\nus we are missing the point.\nBy framing climate change\nas a purely technological\nproblem, we end up letting\nthe worst climate offenders\noff the hook. This is precisely\nwhy geoengineering is so\nappealing to policymakers;\nthose who are used to\nframing climate change as\na technological issue are\nprimed to seek technological\nsolutions, rather than make\nany serious attempt to change\nthe economic factors driving\nemissions. As years pass and\nemissions continue to soar,\n\\\\ We are\nnothing more than\nindividuals looking\nto outcompete\neach other, rather\nthan social animals\nwho all have a\nvested interest in\nthe fate of our\nshared planet \\\\\nYou have no\nexcuse for\nnot recycling\nGiulia Costa gives top tips on how to\nbe a better human being\nH\nave you ever\nspent a long time\nstaring at the\ncoloured bins\nwondering where\nyour everything\nshould go? Wondering if\nsomeone is judging your bin\nchoice? Well good, because\nrecycling is important.\nThe global population is\nrapidly increasing and our\nlifestyles generate huge\namounts of waste. In the UK,\nan average person generates\naround 413kg of waste\nevery single year. The waste\nproduced in this country\nwithin less than two hours\ncould fill the Royal Albert Hall.\nManaging this wastefulness\ncan be done through the three\nRs: Reducing, Reusing and\nRecycling. These are listed in\norder of importance, but for\nnow, this article will focus on\nthe final R: Recycling.\n\\\\ We are nudged to recycle,\nbut we're often not told how\nto do it properly \\\\\nA lot of recyclable material\nis disposed of in general\nwaste bins. This is a shame as\nsimply disposing of rubbish\nin landfill sites is incredibly\nharmful to the environment\nand translates to a loss of\nresources. Throwing away\npotentially recyclable waste\nis like throwing energy\naway. Recycling one tin\ncan, for example, would\ngive the equivalent energy\nto powering a TV for three\nhours! Recycling takes little\neffort and it goes a long way.\nThis is why we are nudged\nto recycle, but we\u2019re often not\ntold how to do it properly.\nAt Imperial, for example,\nthere are excellent recycling\nfacilities across all campuses\nand halls. But lack of clarity\nwhen it comes to \u2018what goes\nwhere\u2019 causes a very real loss\nof efficiency. We\u2019ve all been\nthere: \u201cwhere should I throw\nmy tea bag? Should I empty\nthe contents into food waste\nand throw the bag in paper?\nWhat is the meaning of life?\u201d\nSo we just either guess or\nthrow it into general waste\nto be safe. But in fact there\nare clear guidelines and dos\nand don\u2019ts when it comes to\nrecycling. (For the record,\nmost tea bags can simply be\nthrown in the food waste as\nthe bags are biodegradable.)\nFirst of all, plastic bags: Do\nnot throw these in dry mixed\nrecycling! Not all plastics can\nbe easily recycled. Only hard\nplastics go in the green dry\nmixed recycling bins. These\ninclude things like plastic\nbottles, tubs and trays. Plastics\noften have a category, which\nis shown on them.\nThen we have pizza boxes:\nGreasy pizza boxes should\nnot be recycled with paper,\nand can make a whole batch\nof paper and carton non-recyclable. On a related\nnote, you should clean any\nfood container you throw\ninto recycling. It does take\nmore effort, but it cannot be\nrecycled if you don't, so the\nextra effort goes a long way.\nAnother helpful thing you\ncan do is remove the caps\nfrom plastic bottles before\nthrowing them in the dry\n\\\\ Part of the\nresponsibility to make\nthis country more\nsustainable lies with\nthose living in it \\\\\nmixed recycling. Caps and\nbottles are made of different\nplastics, and separating them\nmakes life a lot easier for\nrecycling plants. But now for\nsomething that will save you\ntime! Although some people\nthink it is necessary, you do\nnot have to remove labels\nfrom food containers before\nrecycling them.\nWhen it comes to glass,\nnot all is recyclable. Things\nlike window glass or glass\nlaboratory equipment should\nnot be thrown in the red\nbin. The same thing goes for\npackaging made out of paper\n\u2013 paper cups or cartons that\nare waxed should not go in\nthe red bin. Paper towels and\nnapkins should also not be\nrecycled, even though they're\nmare made out of paper.\nAnd if you don\u2019t know what\nto do with a particular waste\nitem like a nappy, some old\ntights or that Celine Dion CD\nyou got last Christmas, that\u2019s\nokay (all of the above are\nrecyclable FYI). Simply not\nknowing where to put waste\nitems is more common than\nyou think. Looking it up online\nis always a good idea, and\nif not, many items actually\nhave recycling instructions\non them. For items that are\ntrickier to recycle such as\naerosols or batteries, there\nare online resources such as\nImperial College\u2019s online\nwaste directory, which give\ninstructions of how to dispose\nof them.\nMany facilities have posters\nthat detail what gets recycled\nwhere (Imperial will also be\nadopting this measure soon).\nOnce you learn what goes\nwhere you will see recycling\nis not that hard!\nBy implementing these small\nchanges, recycling can be\nmade much more efficient.\nBy taking these \u2018hacks\u2019 and\napplying them at home we\nbecome even more efficient.\nLondon is presently one of\nthe worst recyclers in the\nUK. Countrywide, the UK\u2019s\nrecycling rate for household\nwaste has gone down\nrecently bringing us further\nfrom the EU\u2019s goal to recycle\n50% of waste. Part of the\nresponsibility to make this\ncountry more sustainable lies\nwith those living in it. It is our\nresponsibility to recycle well\nand efficiently to ensure a\nbrighter future for our planet.\nIf recycling is not enough for\nyou and you want to make a\nbigger change come and join\nus in ESoc and participate in\nour recycling campaign.\n\\\\ Looking it up\nonline is always a\ngood idea, and many\nitems actually have\nrecycling instructions\non them \\\\\n\n"

The fondant wasn\u2019t\nhot enough that it burnt my\ntongue, and the ice cream\ndidn\u2019t give me a brain freeze,\nthey were both exactly right\ntemperatures. Pooja got\na cheesecake, and said it\nwas \u201creally good\u201d again. I\nneed to work on her food\ndescriptions. My other friend\ngot a really big portion of\napple crumble that tasted like\na warm hug. Just like apple\ncrumble should \u2013 so that went\ndown a treat.\nShanzeh Khurshid\nAs the waiter constantly\nrefilled our tap waters and\nhad patiently waited on us\nwith a constant smile despite\nour numerous mind changes\nand complicated requests, we\nwanted to tip him, but didn\u2019t\nbecause the whole point of\neating here was to get a deal.\nSo we awkwardly refused\nto pay the optional service\ncharge, but he still smiled\nand was accommodating! He\nwas probably the best waiter\nI\u2019ve ever had, which is what\nyou get when you go to a\nfancy restaurant. We wrote\nhim a note on the back of our\nreceipt thanking him, so at\nleast he knows we appreciated him, even if he wasn\u2019t\n\\\\ We wrote him a\nnote, so he knows\nwe appreciated him,\neven if he didn\u2019t get\na tip. I don\u2019t know\nif that makes it any\nbetter \\\\\nLocation, location, location\nWhilst religiously completing my daily routine of\nprocrastination, I happened to view my friend\u2019s,\nwho seems to have a lot of money to spend on food,\nsnapchat story. She always puts up gourmet looking\npictures, but whenever I google the restaurants their\nprices are so student unfriendly. But when I googled\nPercy and Founders, a fancy gastropub in Fitzrovia,\nI found to my delight, that they have half price on\nall food on certain days! So I roped some friends of\nmine into trying some upmarket British gastronomy.\nFirst Impressions\nThe restaurant is extremely spacious and airy,\nwith floor to ceiling windows, two bars and an\nopen kitchen. It has a series of rooms which are\ncosily decorated like a dining room in a rich person\u2019s house. A waitress greeted two of my friends\nand I, then led us to a bar where another friend\nof ours was waiting for us whilst sophisticatedly\nsipping upon his tap water. We were seated and\ngot down to deciding what to order.\nThere were a limited number of vegetarian\noptions, which made it easy for both of my\nvegetarian friends to choose what they want.\nHowever, my friend Pooja and I have slightly\nmore complicated dietary requirements. Pooja\nhad been talking about how she was going to\nget the Sunday roast since we got onto the tube,\nunfortunately the waiter informed us it was beef,\nwhich she doesn\u2019t eat. She then asked for the\nlamb shank. The waiter took her order, disappeared to the kitchen, but shortly came back to\ninform us that lamb is cooked in beef gravy. We\nasked if a separate gravy could be made for her,\nwhich he enquired about. It couldn\u2019t. At least he\nwas intelligent enough to check out the ingredients\nhimself now that he knew her requirements. She\nfinally settled for sea bream and I got a risotto,\nbut not before the waiter separately went to check\nwhether either were cooked in alcohol, as I don\u2019t\ndrink and she doesn\u2019t like the taste of it. That took\nus about 20 minutes, because of all the back and\nforth.\ngetting a tip. I don\u2019t know if\nthat makes it any better.\nInstead of mints at the exit,\nthere was a bowl of matches,\nI presume so you can light up\nyour post-dinner cigar. There\nwas a definite difference in\nthe taste of the food here\nand that which you get at\na normal chain restaurant.\nEverything had defined,\ndelicious flavours, and the\nportion sizes meant that you\nwere full, but not lethargically so. I got oysters, risotto,\nfondant, matches and really\ngood service all for the total\nof around \u00a313! Definitely\nworth the money.\n\n"

This isn't always the\ncase, of course: we have a lot\nof egomaniacs and people\nposturing to be career politicians who have very long-term\ngoals in mind. But the person\nwho has had experience with\nthe mental health support at\nImperial is more likely to want\nto improve it by donating their\ntime as DPW. The person who\nwouldn't have made it through\nsecond year without their\nsports team is going to want\nto be DPCS to make sure that\neveryone else has the same\nopportunities. The person who\nnearly failed third year but\ndidn't because of their academic support may turn out to\n\\\\ There is a long\nlegacy of ex-sabbatical officers\ndealing with their\nmental health fallout\nfor years following\ntheir time at the\nUnion \\\\\nbe passionate enough to run\nfor DPE.\nAnd this isn't a bad thing.\nThese are the people who've\nneeded the resources most, the\nones who know how powerful\nthe Union can be. They truly\ndo care (probably too much),\nunlike the majority of students\nwho get in and out with their\ndegree, never pausing to look\nback. They aren't the ones\nwho wanted the most bang for\ntheir buck, taking advantage\nof what was on offer without\never giving back.\nBut, students who meet the\ncriteria that qualify them as a\nstrong sabbatical candidate\nare being thrown into the pressure cooker environment of\nthe Union, and left high and\ndry when it comes to receiving\nany kind of support through the\nprocess.\nBoth during campaigning and after it (whether or\nnot they have been elected)\nthere is a distinct lack of support for the students who are\nputting themselves out there,\nputting their heart and soul\ninto something they believe\nin. Campaigning is immensely\nstressful for everyone, and for\nthose who are unsuccessful, it\ncan be a massive blow. In the\npast, the Union has run sessions ahead of the elections to\nlet people know what they're in\nfor, what being a sabb is like,\nand to give them tips on how\nto cope with it. That doesn't\nseem to have materialised this\nyear, leaving this year's candidates potentially unprepared.\nSome sabbs get lucky, and\nenter a full team of Union staff\nwho are able to manage their\nworkload and support them.\nBut others enter the teams that\nthe ever-present staff shortages have hit hardest, forcing\nthem to push themselves to fill\na full time staff role as well as\nmeeting manifesto points that\nthey're held accountable to\nachieve.\nBut the sabbs are just students.\nThey are not fully fledged graduates who have applied for\nthese jobs. They are students\nwho have been given these\nroles, with very little experience relevant to being a trustee\nof a multi million pound charity,\nbecause they care. And it's this\ndetermination to better things\n\\\\ Those who\nhave experienced\ndifficulties during\ntheir time at Imperial\nare the ones who\nknow the system \\\\\n\\\\ The way that\nsabbatical officers\nare being handled\nposes a huge risk\nto their mental\nhealth that the\nUnion is refusing to\nacknowledge \\\\\nand to care that can be a detriment to their mental health.\nThese days, each sabb has\na line manager who is responsible for them, whether that\nmeans supervising their email\ntraffic, assigning them tasks,\nor ensuring they are staying\non track. But when it takes five\nmonths to give Union welfare\nofficers mental health first aid\ntraining that was due during\nthe handover at the beginning of the year, how can we\nexpect each of the senior management group to be trained\nto handle the mental health of\nthe students under their care?\nThe way that sabbatical\nofficers are being handled\nposes a huge risk to their\nmental health, one that the\nUnion is steadfastly refusing to\nacknowledge or take any steps\nto mitigate. In the absence of\nany staffing problems, if the\nUnion functioned as a well-oiled machine, then these roles\nmight be suitable, but thanks to\npoor management, the sabbs\nare the ones who are suffering.\nThe Union is being irrespon-sible. Irresponsible in the way\nthat it is recruiting candidates\n404 - FILE NOT FOUND\n404\n- FILE\nN\nO\nT\nFO\nUN\nD\n404 - FILE NOT FOUND\nwithout fully preparing them,\nand irresponsible in the way\nit's failing to support them.\nThere is a long legacy of\nex-sabbatical officers dealing\nwith their mental health fallout\nfor years following their time at\nthe Union, and it's a trend that\nneeds to stop now.\nHopefully one day soon the\nUnion will take notice of the\ntrail of sabbs it\u2019s leaving in its\nwake, but when you\u2019re watching the future sabbs battle it\nout on Meet the Candidates,\nspare a thought for just how\nmuch they\u2019re giving up for your\nsakes. And if you\u2019re planning\non running for a sabbatical\nposition, for God\u2019s sake make\nsure you take care of yourself,\nbecause no one else will.\n\\\\ Thanks to poor\nmanagement, the sabbs are\nthe ones who are suffering \\\\\n\n"

While the film\nmight revel in its celebration\nof 1978 \u2013 Talking Heads had\njust released their first album,\nTimes Square was still dirty,\nand the hardcore punk scene\nwas emerging in Southern\nCalifornia \u2013 Jamie and Dorothea are both characters who\nare unmoored to a particular\ntime, trapped between eras.\nMills\u2019 directorial style is\ndivisive, marked by his complex collaging of words and\nimages; the use of voiceover recurs throughout the\nfilm, moving forwards and\nbackwards through time, the\nepitome of an omniscience\nnarrator. At certain points this\nis used for devastating effect,\nsuch as when Dorothea tells\nus she will die before the\nnew millennium, from cancer\ncaused by the cigarettes\never-present in her hands; but\nat other times the use of stock\nimages and pictures can have\na more distancing effect, and\ncan easily seem twee.\nStill, Mills\u2019 greatest achievement with 20th\nCentury\nWomen, aside from the beautiful screenplay, is the room\nhe gives his actors to reach\ninside themselves and deliver\ntop performances. Bening\nis exceptional as Dorothea,\nalternating from motherly\nlove to stone-cold wit, and\nalways in complete control of\nher body language. Gerwig\ndelivers possibly a career-best performance, allowing\nher Abbie to plumb emotional\ndepths that usually eschew\nher in the kooky roles into\nwhich she is typecast; Fanning\nsimilarly is cast against type,\nher innocent image playing\noff against her secret life\nof smoking and sleeping\naround.\nLast year, Mills said in an\ninterview that \u201cIt felt like I was\nraised by my mom and sisters,\nso I was always appealing to\nwomen in the punk scene or\nwomen in my world. I always\nleaned to them to figure out\nmy life as a straight white\nguy. So I wanted to make\na movie about that.\u201d 20th\nCentury Women is a fitting\ntribute. A tribute to a particular time, and a particular\nplace, but above all a tribute\nto the funny, beautiful, tender\nwomen who raised him.\nFred Fyles\nbe described as intimate, but\nMills never lets us forget that\na seismic cultural shift is on\nthe horizon: Reagan, the War\non Drugs, Y2K. This bigger\npicture spills over into the\ncharacters\u2019 lives most obviously towards the end of the\nfilm, when a group of them sit\ndown in Dorothea\u2019s house to\nwatch Jimmy Carter\u2019s \u2018Crisis\nof Confidence\u2019 speech. Dorothea declares it \u201cbeautiful\u201d,\nbut another character says\n\u201cit\u2019s all over for him\u201d. The\nother character is right: two\nshort years after the speech\nReagan will enter the White\nHouse, signalling the end of\nMills\u2019 carefree vision.\nJust as with Beginners \u2013\nwhich centred around the\nrelationship between Oliver\nand his father Hal, who came\nout as gay in his mid-70s, following the death of Oliver\u2019s\nmother \u2013 20th\nCentury Women\nexamines the distance that is\nestablished between parents\nand children. Bening\u2019s Dorothea is a cipher: at one point\nJamie asks her \u201cdo you think\nyou\u2019re happy?\u201d, to which she\nresponds \u201cseriously, you don\u2019t\njust ask people questions like\nthat. Especially your mom.\u201d\nIn another scene, after being\nlent feminist literature by\nAbbie, Jamie reads aloud a\npassage of Zoe Moss\u2019 It Hurts\nto be Alive and Obsolete:\nThe Ageing Woman: \u201cI am\ngregarious, interested in\nothers, and I think intelligent.\u201d\nJamie quotes, \u201cAll I ask is to\nget to know people and to\nhave them interested in knowing me\u201d. Dorothea, visibly\nangered by this display, cuts\nJamie down: \u201cI don\u2019t need to\nread a book to know about\nme.\u201d\nJust as Abbie and Jamie\nare trapped between eras \u2013\nin the long stretch from the\ndeath of JFK that signalled the\nend of the American dream,\nand the rise of Reagan that\nsignalled a new dream, for\nsome and not all \u2013 Dorothea\nis caught at a turning point in\nthe 20th\ncentury: old enough\nto be admitted to flight\nschool, but too young to have\nbeen able to pilot in WWII;\nborn late enough to trailblaze\na way into being the first\ndraftsperson in the company,\nbut too early to break\nthrough the residual glass\nAnnette Bening is outstanding as Dorothea in\nMike Mills\u2019 exploration of motherhood \\\\ Alamy\n20 th\nCentury\nWomen | All\nhail Annette\nBening\nA\ns part of the\npromotional\nmaterial for\n20th\nCentury\nWomen,\ndirector Mike\nMills\u2019 latest work, there\u2019s a\nwebsite called \u2018My Mother\nBefore Me\u2019, where users\ncan upload pictures of what\ntheir mother looked like\nbefore they had children. The\nshots, which are hazy and\nsaturated, each come with\na brief description from the\nchild of what their mother\nwas like; what is noticeable,\nhowever, is how superficial\nthese descriptors are. They all\nseem to center around what\nthe mothers did, or how many\nchildren they had, or how\nthey looked \u2013 few delve into\nthe emotional life of a mother.\nIt is this disconnect, between\nthe thoughts and feelings\nof parents and children,\nthat Mills explores in 20th\nCentury Women. Like his last\nfilm, Beginners, 20th\nCentury\nWomen was created with\nmaterial mined from Mills\u2019\nown childhood; it is no sur-prise, then, that he described\nthe film as \u201ca collective portrait of the women who raised\nus\u201d. Taking on the mantle of\nhis mother is Annette Bening,\nwho plays Dorothea Fields,\na draftsperson born into the\nDepression, who had one\nchild late in life, and has\nsince divorced her husband;\nrattling around in a mansion\non the Californian coast,\nDorothea and her son, Jamie\n(Lucas Jade Zumann), form\nthe emotional core of the film.\nAttached to them are a variety of lodgers and friends:\nAbbie (Greta Gerwig), a\nyoung punk who escaped\nthe West Coast for New\nYork and art school, only to\nreturn following a diagnosis\nof cervical cancer; William\n(Billy Crudup), a mechanic\nand handyman who fixes up\nthe house in exchange for\nrent; and Julie (Elle Fanning),\nJamie\u2019s best friend whose\npsychiatrist mother forces her\nto attend group therapy.\nAt the beginning of the film,\nDorothea, fearing that Jamie\nis slipping away from her,\nenlists Abbie and Julie to help\nraise him into a good man.\nThis forms the key nucleus of\nthe drama, which could best\nMike Mills\u2019 love letter to the women\nthat raised him has its flaws, but\nits uncanny evocation of shared\nnostalgia, and exceptional acting\ntalent, make it a heartfelt piece\nof emotional cinematic drama\n\n"

Pretty\nimpressive right? No, I know,\nbut it means I have always\nseen swimming as an epic,\nalmost vampire-slaying-esque\nactivity. And I\u2019ve never really\nbeen any good at it. So when\nI was handed the opportunity\nto try a sport I\u2019ve never\nplayed, hockey, and take it to\nthe pool, I was apprehensive.\nUnderwater hockey, or\nOctopush, does exactly what\nit says on the tin. Hockey,\nwith sticks and all, played in\nyour local lido. Two teams of\nsix aim to push a weighted\npuck into the opponent\u2019s goal\n(the construction of which\nresembled the underwater\nequivalent of sticking jumpers\ndown as goal posts). The\nsticks are essentially shortened versions of their land\ncousins. Breathing, which I\nlearnt rather quickly involves\ndrinking half the pool, is\ntricky: requiring a technique\nby which you dive down with\na deep breath and surface\nwith a tip of the head and\nan almighty cough to empty\nout the snorkel tube. Being a\nstrong swimmer helps, but it\u2019s\nalso an advantage to have\na good element of flexibility.\nwas provided in the form of\nflippers and a snorkel. Once\nagain, Imperial clubs are\nproviding free equipment\nfor those unable to purchase\nkit themselves. Underwater\nhockey is no exception, giving\nme a range of sizes to ensure\nI could compete comfortably.\nOnce in the water, I\u2019m given\nclear and concise instructions as to how to breathe\nproperly. Having tried it\nand resembled a fish out of\nbetween team mates. The\nknack is to wait for the person\ntwo turns in front before\ndiving down, ready to receive\nthe puck. This technique is pivotal during a game: dive too\nsoon and you\u2019ll run out of air,\ntoo late and your opponent\nswims under you like a scene\ntaken straight from Jaws.\nThe scuba team kindly took\nsome snaps of me trying this:\ntypically, they only caught my\npoorer attempts otherwise\nI would like to say that my\nability to puck-push closely\nresembled that of a graceful\nmermaid, but only to the\nextent that it was completely\nfictional. Fortunately, the\nmembers were very support-ive, giving me hints and tips\non how to improve. Similar to\nmany clubs I\u2019ve visited, everyone is very welcoming and\ndriven to improve your ability\nand not just their own.\nAs I had to leave early, we\nwere put straight into a mini\ngame. Now, normally by this\npoint in a session I\u2019ve got the\nbasics down and can join in\nas much as possible. Unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t just trying to\nfind my feet but also my lungs,\nso to say I was playing would\nbe generous. I did, however,\nget a good idea of how\nthe sport is played and the\nmanoeuvres required in order\nto be triumphant. Players start\nat either end of the pool and\nrush to the puck which has\nbeen placed in the centre,\nsimilarly to dodgeball. You\nnominate someone to rush\nforward and the rest swim\ntowards the other team. What\nfollows closely resembles a\ncontrolled piranha feast, with\nless blood and more stick\nswiping. Players will attempt\nto move the puck through the\npool but passing before your\nlungs scream for air. A culmination of strong swimming\ntechnique and puck control is\nessential, but it\u2019s not a sport\nto be avoided purely due to\npoor ability. Similar to many\nof the more unusual sports it\u2019s\nseverely under-represented,\nbut provides an opportunity\nto be a stronger swimmer and\nteam player. I urge you to\nat least go online and watch\nsome being played, then\nsubsequently attend training\non Thursday nights as you will\nlike what you see.\nThe only downside I can\nthink of is that I couldn\u2019t wear\nmy usual Birmingham City\nshirt.\nwater, we move onto some\nsimple breathing drills along\nthe length of the pool. We\nwould swim a section of the\npool along the floor then the\nremainder along the surface.\nThis helped train newcomers\non the different positions\nrequired when playing. It was\nexplained to me that players\nusually float near the surface\nwhen not in play, then quickly\ndive down in order to get\ninvolved.\nAs you can see, the club\nhave designed exercises\nwhich aptly address this most\nbasic of skills. It shows the\nsign of a good team when\nthey start with the basics,\neven for those who are a\ndab hand. There are a few\nnewbies in the session with\nme, and they are treated\nwith great care as expected\nin a sport which is potentially dangerous for weaker\nswimmers. However, let\u2019s not\ntry and sugar coat it here, I\nwasn\u2019t exactly flying up and\ndown the pool. More like\nconfidently diving down a\nfew centimetres due to an\nincreased\u2026 let\u2019s say buoyancy\u2026 around the midriff.\nBut I certainly tried and it\nhas definitely convinced me\nto spend more time in my\nspeedos, much to my wife\u2019s\ndismay.\nNext up, puck exercises.\nWe split into two teams and\nform circles. This is a \u2018simple\u2019\ntask where you push the puck Sam Smith\n\\\\ Hockey, with\nsticks and all, played\nin your local lido \\\\\nSomething I struggle with\nseeing as I can\u2019t even touch\nmy toes.\nSessions at Imperial take\nplace at the Ethos pool,\nshared with the University\nscuba diving club under the\numbrella of the underwater\ngroup. This helped when\ntaking pictures of yours truly\nto highlight my budding\nmer-man impersonation.

A\nseries of hard carries (particu-larly from Moorby and CPS in\nthe centres) took IC deep into\nRUMS territory, and when\nthe visitors infringed trying\nto stem the tide, Price Smith\nstepped up and continued\nhis unusual recent trend of\nconverting penalties, to give\nImperial the lead. Not satisfied with this, IC came hard\nat RUMS again. A dazzling\nrun, with some spellbinding\nfootwork, from stage one\nBilly, got RUMS back peddling again. Field moved the\nball quickly out wide to Zaboronksy, who drove over the\nline to score, with CPS adding\nthe extras.\nRUMS finally started to\nget a bit of a foothold in the\ngame. A few of their big\nforwards worked out that it\nwas possible to make yards,\nif only they don\u2019t run at DNS.\nTheir number eight instead\nran at Clayton and put an\nend to what had been a busy\n20 minutes from the flanker,\nby pretty much knocking him\nout and leaving a sizeable\negg on his head (not yet\nknown if either the egg or\nthe dazed Clayton has been\nre-poached). Thankfully Curtis\nwas on hand to slot in, but\nthe disruption suited RUMS\nwho got back into the game.\nFirstly with a neatly taken\ndrop goal, then a converted\ntry, with nice footwork taking\ntheir big second row past\nsome tired looking defence\nto leave the half time score at\n10-10.\nIC came out guns blazing\nafter the break, their set piece\ndominance giving them a\ngreat platform to build off.

Zaboronsky added his second\ntry, utilising a powerful fend\nCambridgehumiliatedbyImmortals\nImraj Singh\nI\nt has been only two\nweeks since the\nImmortals fell victim\nto the Cambridge\nPythons. With a lapse\nof concentration (from\na heavily fatigued Defence)\nthe score was 6-0 for Pythons\nwhen the bell did toll. The\nloss was particularly painful\ndue to the honest fact we\nare the better team, and on\nthat day it was insufficient\npreparation that ultimately let\nus down.\nThe day began cold, made\nall the worse when Markus\n\u2018Where\u2019s your bus?\u2019 Mohr\nfound out the minibus we\nhad booked was missing.\nDespite this, we got to the\nfortress of Harlington ready\nto defend it against the then\nundefeated Pythons. We\ntoo are undefeated but only\nat home; needless to say,\nboth team had streaks we\nwanted to keep. Immortals\nstarted strong and maintained\nmomentum for the whole\ngame. Our star quarterback,\nlinebacker, kicker and punter\nJason \u2018Captain America\u2019\nPatrick Kuilan scored four\ntouchdowns on offence, and\nflew around making massive\nhits on defence.

As well as scoring on\noffence we also scored on\ndefence when Henners \u2018one\nand burst of pace, following\nexcellent work from subs Will\nCarter and Curtis. Carter got\ninvolved again with a second\nlung-bursting break up the\nmiddle. The offload didn\u2019t\nquite go to hand, but instead\nfell to Miller, who for once\nwas working hard in support.\nSome good footwork from the\nprop controlled the ball and\ngot him over the line, to seal\na 29-13 bonus point victory\nfor Imperial.

DRUGS\nDRUGS\nDrug Bible | Modafinil 101\nHow you use it\nThe vast majority of study drugs come in the form of a convenient pill. Unlike the various brightly coloured pills that\necstasy may come in, modafinil looks like boring plain old\nparacetamol. Modafinil itself claims to keep you at peak\nalertness for around 10 hours, with additional stimulation\nlasting for a few hours after that. However, due to the\nlonger lasting nature of these pills when compared to traditional drugs expect more variation in duration between\npeople. For instance, having known people who have\ntaken the drug, I have received reports that the effects can\nlast anywhere between four and twelve hours depending\non the individual. After taking, keep yourself hydrated, it\u2019s\nimportant to maintain a healthy amount of water in your\nsystem should your body reject the drug and attempt to\nflush it out. As stupid as it sounds, it is also important to\nremember to eat. Expect to feel a diminishing appetite for\nat least the first few hours after ingestion.\nLegality\nAs of the time of writing, in the UK, to possess modafinil is legal. However, it is only legal to\nbuy if you have a prescription. Providing you have a prescription, it is obtainable from your\nlocal chemist or pharmacy. It is also available from many international websites that stick\ntwo fingers up to drug restriction laws in the UK, therefore this stuff is actually obtainable. It\nshould be noted that any attempt to import large amounts of substances such as modafinil will\nonly be considered by the authorities if it is for \u2018personal use\u2019. Typically personal use constitutes no more than a ninety day supply.\nIt is important to be aware about the dangers of ordering drugs from an international\ncompany based in some shady corner of the world. Do not expect everything you order to be\n100% every time.\nThings to do when you\u2019re high\nDo\n\u2022 Take early in the day to\nget the full effect\n\u2022 Make sure you\u2019re in an\nenvironment ready to\nstudy (no distractions)\n\u2022 Stay well hydrated and\nfed\nDon\u2019t\n\u2022 Take expecting the\neffects of ecstasy\n\u2022 Tell your mates how hard\nyou are because you\u2019re\ntaking drugs (you\u2019re\ntaking modafinil you\nprick)\n\u2022 Take after 6pm, then it\u2019s\npretty much guaranteed\nyou won\u2019t get any sleep\nthat night.\nWhat it does\nModafinil is used to increase the\nalertness of the user. Whilst it is\nnormally used to treat narcolepsy\nand other sleep disorders, it is\nalso commonly used as a study\ndrug. Once taken, expect to feel\nmore awake and typically less\nprone to frustration, allowing you\nto become more productive in the\nwork you do. However, with all this\nnew-found alertness it is not uncommon to begin to direct your focus\ntoward less productive endeav-ours. Expect to be distracted more\neasily than normal.\nSome statistics\nIn 2014, a study by The Tab asked 2000 students from 41\ndifferent universities about their experience of study drugs.\nIt found that one in five had taken modafinil, so clearly\nthere is a potential market here. I am unsure whether that\nfigure would be higher or lower at Imperial. On the one\nhand, Imperial students are unwavering in their attempt\nto gain academic success. But on the other hand, students\nhere have been found to be much more averse to drugs\nthan their counterparts at various other institutions.\nImperial College has a strict zero tolerance policy on drugs.\nIf you\u2019re struggling with drug use, visit talktofrank.com\nGlossary\nModding \u2013 The act of being on modafinil\nDaffodils \u2013 Pills of Modafinil\nHey Bradley, you got any Apple Pie? \u2013 When you ask your\nfriend Bradley for modafinil\nYou got Mo\u2019 Da Finil \u2013 When you\u2019re desperate for modafinil\nStimmed Out \u2013 When you\u2019re stimulated.

Love is a drug. It inhibits our\nability to think clearly, turns us into terrible\npeople, and makes us do stupid things. Face\nit, it\u2019s far more harmful than a few hours\ngurning at the weekend. But just like with\ndrugs, there are different kinds of highs, and\nso now, in honour of the just-passed Valentine\u2019s Day,\nI present you the different people you have fallen in\nlove with, and the associated stupid things they will\nmake you do.\nYou\u2019ll love all of these people, in different ways, but\nthey\u2019re nothing compared to your one true love: you.\nLove is the drug you can\u2019t get enough of\nThe first love\nThis is the one you have a crush\non all the way through secondary school. You\u2019ll insist that it is\nreal love, that no one else could\never possibly understand them.\nAlthough they don\u2019t know it yet,\nyou are the one. Unfortunately, for\nthe time being, they will inevitably\nhave a long-term crush on your\nbest friend. The stupidity of youth\nwill have you writing their name all\nover stuff. Even if it\u2019s just your diary\nwhere no one else can see it, that\u2019s\nnot really private, because it\u2019s\ngoing to come back to haunt you\nwhen your parents move house,\npack up your room, and unearth\nthe diaries hidden under your bed.\nThe first relationship\nThis is your first proper relationship, probably\nin sixth form, or with someone from your halls\nwhen you\u2019re a fresher. You\u2019ll think you\u2019re so\ngrown up, when you\u2019re turning down nights\nout to stay in with bae, watch X Factor, and\ncuddle. You\u2019ll probably gain a lot of weight\nbecause of this (not that that\u2019s a bad thing, but\nthere are much more fun ways to get fat than\nto stay in every night eating pizza), and you\u2019ll\npost how much you love each other all over\nfacebook, both of which you\u2019ll regret when\nyou inevitably break up just before the summer\nholidays, bore everyone with your moping for\nsix weeks, and then realise that no one really\nwants that life at your age anyway.\nThe one you idolised\nThis is the one whose attention you can\u2019t\nbelieve you\u2019re receiving. They\u2019re the beautiful\nItalian in your tutorial, the one who sashays in\nlooking effortlessly beautiful and glamorous.\nYou don\u2019t know why they\u2019re suddenly interested in you, but they are. Unfortunately, it will\nmake you cripplingly insecure. Why are they\ntalking to the others? Are they going to leave\nyou for them?! You\u2019ll become paranoid, and\neventually break up with them dramatically\nbefore they can dump you. You\u2019ll get over it\npretty quickly, and will always show people\ntheir facebook profile at parties to brag about\nthis hottie you once scored. You\u2019ll never know\nthat you broke their heart. They could have\nbeen the one.\nThe love at first sight\nThis is the one you\u2019ll meet one Sports Night\nat Metric. You\u2019ll see them across the bar, and\nyour eyes will meet. You\u2019ll start talking to\nthem. Why have you never met before? You\nhave everything in common! This connection\nmust be made to last. You start planning your\nfuture together; they\u2019ll get on so well with your\nfriends. You\u2019ll make your famous Shepherd\u2019s\nPie to impress their housemates, and you\u2019re\nalready starting to put together a parent-safe\nanecdote to explain how you met. But then\nyou go to the toilet and when you come back\nthey\u2019re making out with your friend. Your\nfriends are always so shit. You should get\nbetter friends. You go over to your friend and\nthrow your drink over them. Now that was\nstupid, wasn\u2019t it?\nThe one you thought was the one\nYou\u2019ll think you know everything when you fall in\nlove with this one. You\u2019ve been around the relationship block, you know the difference between stupid\nteenage love and the real love you\u2019re feeling now.\nThey\u2019re the one who\u2019ll be in your family photos at\ngraduation, the one you turn down that amazing\nconsulting job in New York for, because you can\u2019t\nimagine a life without them. You\u2019ll make sacrifices\nand change your life plans for them. If you\u2019re\nunlucky, you\u2019ll get engaged.\nWhen you break up it\u2019ll be unexpected, and you\u2019ll\nstart to relate to VICE articles and think you\u2019re\ninteresting enough to start doing drugs and going to\norgies. You\u2019re probably not, but you probably are\nbetter off now. No one wants the same things after\nthey leave Imperial.\nFirst kiss\nAge 14\nLeave Imperial\nAge 23\nLeave school\nAge 18\nGap year (lose\nyour virginity!)\nAge 18 3/4\nStart Imperial\nAge 19\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nT H E D A R K Y E A R S\nF I N D I N G Y O U R S E L F\nI N N O C E N C E\n\n"

Occasionally\nwe missed out on the edited\ndialogue (I could not help but\npity the charismatic Mercutio,\nwhose lengthy and elaborate\nmonologue of Queen Mab\nand the fairies was cut rather\ncruelly short); however, this\nwell-choreographed and\ndynamic production kept all\nthe key scenes, succeeding in\ntelling the story in an engaging and moving way.\nRomeo Montague, initially\nbesotted with an unseen\nRosaline, is persuaded to\nattend a party hosted by\nCapulet, where his close\nfriend Mercutio hopes Romeo\nwill let his eye wander.\nRomeo, hoping that he will\ncatch a glimpse of Rosaline,\nagrees, and the minimalist set\nis transformed into a vibrant\nparty scene with stream-ers, lights, and balloons\nsuspended from a netted\ncanopy. Through a crowd\nof swirling and colourful\ncostumes, Romeo catches\nsight of Juliet, instantly\nfalls hopelessly in\nlove with her \u2013 all\nfeelings for Rosaline vanishing.\nThe young\nlover's first whispered meeting\nunder the starry\ncanopy seems\nall too brief,\nbefore Juliet is\nnear-dragged\naway to be told\nthat Romeo is\nthe only son of\nher family\u2019s worst\nenemy, Montague.\nAbruptly the conflict\nbetween houses stains\nthe happy scene, and we\nstart to notice the cultural\ndifferences between the two\nfamilies. Juliet appears in a\nmixture of traditional Indian\ngarments and 'noughties'\nneon, whilst Romeo\u2019s local\nchurch features a gospel choir\n(complete with a rousing\nrendition of \u2018O Happy Day\u2019)\nled by Friar Lawrence\u2019s\nHelen Money-Kyrle\nfemale equivalent, Sister\nLawrence, hinting at Romeo\u2019s\nAfrican roots. Though this\ndifference is never directly\naddressed, the underlying\nclash of cultures provides an\ninteresting context for the\nfeud between houses, which\nShakespeare leaves intentionally unexplained.\nBut the lovers prove us\nwrong, with Romeo swearing\nhis love to Juliet as she sits\non her balcony. The next\n\\\\ Squeezed into\na running time of\njust one hour, the\nNational Theatre\u2019s\ninterpretation sets a\nshortened version of\nthe original text in a\nmodern time \\\\\nRomeo and Juliet is on at the\nNational Theatre until 24th\nFebruary\nTickets from \u00a312\n\\\\ Ludovic des Cognets\nmorning the young lovers\nmeet, and are secretly married by Sister Lawrence.\nIt almost seems too good\nto be true when Mercutio\nand the love-struck Romeo\ncome across Juliet\u2019s fiery\ncousin Tybalt who\u2019s ready\nto pick a fight. Never have\nI seen Tybalt played with\nsuch attitude \u2013 by a woman\nmay I add \u2013 who\u2019s knife to\nMercutio\u2019s chest sends blood-red rose petals flying across\nthe stage. Chalk outlines\ndrawn around the bodies of\nMercutio and Tybalt turn the\nstage into a crime scene, and\nserve to remind the audience\nof the events which signal the\nbeginning of the end.\nWith Romeo banished\nfrom Verona, and with her\nfather planning her wedding\nto another man, Juliet desperately seeks the help of\nSister Lawrence, who agrees\nto help her fake her death\nso that she can escape with\nRomeo. But in an unbearable\ntwist he hears not of the plan\nbut of her tragic death, and\ngoes to see her body with a\nvial of deadly poison.\nThe ending was always\ngoing to be agonising, but\nI was horrified to see Juliet\nawake to witness Romeo take\nthe poison. He realises that\nshe lives, but it is too late \u2013 to\nher tormented cries he dies\nin her arms. Devastated, she\ntakes her own life, and we\nare left wondering whether\nwe should feel pained\nthat they could never be\ntogether, or find some\nsolace that in their\ndeaths they proved\nthat love could surpass the cultural and\nsocial boundaries\nimposed upon them.\nLeaving, we are\nasked: \u201cWhat\u2019s in a\nname? that which we\ncall a rose/By any\nother name would\nsmell as sweet\u201d and\nwe are left wondering if\nwe can really answer it,\nhoping that in our modern\nworld love can overcome\nsuch obstacles.\n\\\\ Ludovic des Cognets\nR\nobots, the Science\nMuseum\u2019s shiny\nnewly-opened\nexhibition, is a\nreal treasure\ntrove of delights:\nfeaturing over 100 robots\nmodels it spans 500 years\nof humanity's quest to\nrecreate itself in the form\nof a machine, a process\nhistorically shaped by\nreligion, industrial innovation,\nand popular culture.\nAmong the star attractions\nis the UK-built RoboThespian,\na full-size humanoid robot\nwho also gave the official\nopening speech, receiving\nquite of a standing ovation\nfrom the press. He engages\nin vocal exercises, and gives\na theatrical performance to\nvisitors every 20 minutes.\nThe pieces are striking \u2013 from a 16th\ncentury\nautomaton of a monk to a\n244-year-old working model\nof a silver swan automaton\ncreated by inventor John\nMerlin \u2013 and must have dazzled in their day. Ben Russell,\nthe exhibition's lead curator,\npoints out that most people in\nthe past would not have even\nseen a mechanised clock\nwhen they first clapped\neyes on an automaton,\nso all this was surely\nmesmerising to\nthe audiences of\n1560.\nIn every stage\nof the 500-year\nstory, robots\nhave held a\nmirror to man-kind. Whether\nthe aim was\nbringing the\nBible to life\nwith a mechanized Christ on\nthe cross, or the\npursuit of leisure\nwith clockwork\nanimals and human\nfigurines, model makers\nexplored whether humans\nwere anything more than\nmerely conscious machines.\nA few centuries later, in\nthe enlightened 18th\ncentury,\nmachines became more glee-ful, with automatons of flute\nplayers and writers; in con-trast, the next century brought\na style that was totally unruly,\nwith drunken aristocrats and\ndandies all being recreated\nas automata.\nDespite the praise that these\nmachines received, the rise\nof the mechanised economy\nmade people acutely aware\nthat automated spinning\ndevices were quickly going to\nreplace skilled craftsmen and\nwomen. As a memento of this\nhistorical moment, a replica of\nMaria, the female humanoid\nin the Fritz Lang\u2019s notorious\n1927 film, Metropolis, stares\nat you while you approach\nthe second exhibition room.\nIn the same space, the\nfirst tinplate toy robots for\nkids, that hit the shelves in\nthe 1930s, are displayed\ntogether with a replica\nof the UK first robot Eric\nAgnese Abrusci\nRobots is on at the Science\nMuseum until 3rd\nSeptember\nTickets are \u00a36.75 adults; \u00a35.85 students.\nRoboThespian, who can quote Shakespeare at you \\\\ Agnese Abrusci\n\u2013 presumed dismantled\nafter his risky world tour, he\nwas rebuilt by the Science\nMuseum for the exhibition.\nEric shares the visitors' attention jointly with his younger\nbrother, George, and the\ngiant Cygan, an Italian metal\nshowman built in 1957 who\nshared a magazine cover\nwith Brigitte Bardot.\nThe tin men resembled\nhumans on the outside but\nthey were still operated\nby cables and pulleys until\nthe 1990s, when engineers\nbegan work on anthropo-mimetic robots with plastic\nskeletons and silicon tendons.\nBeside humanizing robot\nbodies, engineers have also\nfocused on the computing\nleaps that allow modern\nrobots to converse with\npeople in a meaningful way,\nproviding information and\nlearning from them.\nWhile you approach the\nlast section of the exhibition\ndedicated to modern robots\n\u2013 passing beside RoboThespian, who recites Hamlet\nand speaks Klingon, Pepper\ndesigned to look after our\nelderly, and Kaspar, who\nhelps autistic children \u2013 you\nsoon realise that a mecha-nised army of robots is\nimminently going to\nfill people\u2019s private\nand public lives.\nThis change\nwill be just as\nradical as the\ndevelopment\nof the internet\nand social\nmedia in the\npast decade.\nBut no human\nactivity is risk\nfree; the go\nhome question\nas we look the\nfuture in its animatronic eyes is what\nwe should fear most:\nartificial intelligence or\nhuman stupidity?\nRobots |\nAll hail our benevolent mechanical overlords\nMaria, the infamous robot from Fritz\nLang's Metropolis \\\\ Agnese Abrusci\n\n"

In the past\nweek alone the washing\nmachines flooded, the internet\nwas down for three days and\nI have been served gone\noff food. Aside from these\ntemporary annoyances, there\nare many long term issues\nwhich repeatedly get patched\nup only to go wrong again\nfurther down the line, but this\ntime ten times worse. Sinks\nand showers do not drain\nproperly the consequences of\nwhich at first were floods, then\nmould growing on the walls\nAlban Hall living conditions deemed poor\nStudents considering withholding rent\nLef Apostolakis\nto be a result of Heythrop\nCollege\u2019s uncertain future.\nHeythrop, which specialises\nin philosophy and theology, is\ncurrentlysettobeclosingdown\nin 2018, after failed attempts\nto form a partnership with the\nUniversity of Roehampton.\nEarlier last year, it was\nrevealed by the Evening\nStandard that agent CBRE\nwas hired earlier last year by\nJesuits in Britain, freeholders of\nthe property, to sell the prime\nplot of Kensington estate.\nA Jesuits in Britain\nspokesperson told the Evening\nStandard that the move to\nsell was at least partially\nmotivated by financial loses.\nThe bidding was expected to\nstart at at least \u00a3100 million.\n\u201cHeythrop College incurs\na significant financial deficit\neach year. The financial reality\nis that as a small institution,\nwithin this highly competitive\nhigher education environment\nand with the costly regulatory\ndemands, it cannot continue in\nits current form.\u201d\nThe Halls at Heythrop\nCollege will most likely be\naccepting new tenants for the\nacademic year of 2017/2018.\nWhether there are plans to\nrefurbish the estate before it\u2019s\nsold off is unclear. But based\non the current situation we\nthink it\u2019s unlikely.\nF\nollowing the reveal\nof the poor housing\nconditions at Evelyn\nGardens earlier last\nyear, another Hall\nof Residence has\nbeen found guilty of offering\nsub-par accommodation,\nafter numerous reports were\nbrought to felix\u2019s attention.\nThis time, students at Alban\nHall have had to consistently\ndeal with plumbing, electrical,\nand, possibly the worst of all,\ninternet connectivity issues\nsince the very beginning of\ntheir accommodation. But the\nrecent, rapid deterioration of\nconditions, including flooding\nin the laundry facilities, a\nthree day long internet cut and\nreported serving of expired\nfood (Alban is a catered Hall),\nhas made many disgruntled\nresidents speak out. \u201cIt\u2019s\nan absolute dangerous\nshit show\u201d, says Joseph\nUniversity of London college\nin which Alban is situated)\nleft the computer suite open\nto residents overnight. A\nFacebook post by one of the\nwardens read \u201cHeythrop are\nkeeping the computing suite\nopen in the main building\ntonight... They\u2019ve asked us to\npass on their apologies \u2013 they\nhad hoped to have it fixed\ntoday.\u201d\nBut these are just extreme\nexamples in a string of\npersisting issues. The plights of\nAlban\u2019s residents include but\nare not limited to: days without\ninternet, laundry machines in\nneed of repair, clogged drains\nleading to leaks, flooding, and\nmould; plug sockets routinely\nat UCL.\nDespite the frustration of\nAlban Hall residents, there\nis no animosity against the\nwardens \u201cI think the wardens\nand sub-wardens are doing\ntheir best to help students out.\nIn fact, I have no ill feelings\ntowards the people running\nthe hall. However, I hope from\nthe bottom of my heart that my\n225quidperweekinrentmight\nfinally be put to better use,\u201d\nsays May Kyaw a first year\nbiochemist. Imperial students\npay, approximately \u00a37,700 a\nyear for their accommodation\nat Alban Hall. Their Heythrop\nequivalents pay \u00a36,400.\nIn response a College\nspokesperson said \u201cWe\nare aware that issues were\nraised with wardens in\nAlban Hall earlier this term,\nand apologise to students\naffected. We understand that\nthe issues were discussed at\na Hall Committee and quickly\naddressed. We are concerned\nto hear that felix have received\nreports of ongoing problems.\n\u201cWe take any reports of\nproblemswithaccommodation\nvery seriously and encourage\nstudents to come forward\nwith any issues if the arise. In\nAlban Hall, students should\ncontact the Hall management\nstaff (located in the Heythrop\nCollege Accommodation\nOffice) directly with reports of\nany problems.\u201d\nThe lack of action is thought\n\\\\ It\u2019s an absolute\ndangerous shit\nshow \\\\\n\\\\ In the past week\nalone the washing\nmachines flooded,\nthe internet was\ndown for three days\nand I have been\nserved gone off\nfood \\\\\nO\u2019Connell-Danes a first year\nchemist and unlucky resident\nof the decrepit Hall, \u201cthere is\nfast growing contempt for the\nhalls and increasing chatter in\nabout rent reductions being\ndeserved.\u201d\nLast Monday, in a desperate\nattempt to appease internet\ndeprived students, the\nmanagement at Heythrop (the\nlosing power, leading to\nfridges without power and\nthe subsequent rotting of\ngroceries.\n\u201cWhen we first moved in to\nAlban Hall it was obvious that\neverything was a bit run down\nbut that was the price to pay\nfor a great location and being\ncatered\u201d says Ella Vialle-Sole,\nanother chemistry undergrad.\n(which is not the best when\nyou are asthmatic), and finally\nthe leaking water filled all the\nlights in the bathrooms and\nstopped them from working.\nIt was lucky no one got\nelectrocuted\u201d\nThe poor living conditions\nhave led to the creation of a\nFacebook page dedicated to\nmemes trying to make light of\nthe situation. Some students\nhowever are considering\nserious action involving\nwithholding rent like their\ncounterparts have been doing \\\\ Memethrop\n\\\\ Memethrop\nLeft ,mould in bathroom; Right ,Floodmark \\\\ Mark Pollock\n\n"

A range of media is\nincluded \u2013 not just paintings,\nbut also film, photography\nand all manner of parapher-nalia: posters, \u201cagitational\nporcelain\u201d decorated with\ncommunist symbols, banners,\nand textiles. Artworks are\nnot viewed as standalone\npieces, but placed firmly in\nthe original context in which\nthey were created. Beginning\nwith glorified portraits of\nLenin and ending with Stalin\u2019s\npolitically correct socialist\nrealism, the exhibition\nleads us through 11\nrooms and over\n200 artworks,\nmany of which\nhave never\nbeen exhibited in the UK\nbefore.\nA great\nclash of\nideas is on\ndisplay.\nRooms of\npropagandist work,\nstaunchly promoting Bolshevik\nideals, contrast\nsharply with the\nabstract modernism of\nthe Russian avant-garde.\nThe futuristic, new-age\ndepictions of machinery and\nindustrialization, such as\nAleksandr Deyneka\u2019s Textile\nWorkers and Arkady Shaikhet's Komsomol at the Wheel,\nare juxtaposed against nostalgic images of the birch forests\nand provincial life in pre-rev-olution Russia. In the room\n\u2018Fate of the Peasants\u2019, utopian\nvisions of collectivised farming and golden harvests strike\na dissonant chord against\nKazimir Malevich\u2019s faceless\npeasants, and the mistrustful\neyes of Boris Grigoriev\u2019s Old\nDairy Woman.\n\u2018Brave New World\u2019 is a\nlarge room celebrating the\nexplosion of artistic ideas\nin the years immediately\nfollowing 1917. Many artists\nwere initially optimistic about\nthe revolution, viewing it as a\nchance to develop new styles\nof art for a modern Russia.\nExperimental styles and\nnovel ways of looking at art\nproliferated; among them are\nthe movements of Suprematism and Constructivism. On\ndisplay are a range of works\nfrom some of the most important artists of the period,\nincluding Wassily Kandinsky, Lyubov Popova, Marc\nChagall, and El Lissitzky.\nDziga Vertov\u2019s short montage\nfilm Man with A Movie\nClaire Chan\nRevolution: Russian Art 1917\n\u2013 1932 is on at the Royal\nAcademy until 17th\nApril 2017\nTickets from \u00a316\nBolshevik, Boris Mikailovich Kustodiev,\n1920 \\\\ State Tretyakov Gallery\nCamera is shown elsewhere\nin the exhibition, while the\nSuprematist painter Malevich\nhas a room to himself.\nIndeed, two rooms are\ndedicated to artists who were\ninvited to showcase their\nwork at the 1932 Leningrad\nexhibition: Malevich\u2019s room\nis an almost exact recrea-tion, displaying his reductive\nSuprematist works such as\nBlack Square alongside more\nrepresentational art created\nunder Soviet pressure. The\nblank faces of the people in\nhis paintings evoke the loss\nof identity and an uncertain\nfuture in the post-revolution\nperiod. The second room,\ndedicated to the artist Kuzma\nPetrov-Vodkin, is interesting,\nbut rather less impressive.\nA slightly ominous air hangs\nover the exhibition. Despite\nthe determinedly cheerful\nportrayals of heroic workers\nand the stoically solemn faces\nof the great leaders, there is\na vague sense that they are\nall marching towards certain\ndoom. This is emphasised\nby little details (a kerchief\nof Lenin with Trotsky\u2019s face\ncarefully cut out from one\ncorner) and more obvious\nsigns, such as the artwork\nof ration cards and wartime\nposters. Even the exuberance\nof the avant-garde is undercut\nby knowledge of the dreadful\nfates that lay in store for both\nthe artists and the subjects\nof their paintings \u2013 from\nAnna Akhmatova to\nVsevolod Meyerhold, few of them\nescaped the\ncoming purges\nunscathed.\nIn a high,\ndomed room\noff to one side,\na reconstruction of one of\nVladimir Tatlin\u2019s\ndelicate \u201cflying\nmachines\u201d spins\nlazily in endless\ncircles. Visually\nstunning, it seems a\nsymbol of the grand\naspirations of the era\nwhich ultimately never took\noff the ground.\nPeasants, Kazimir Malevich, 1930 \\\\\nState Russian Museum\nL\nogistically alone,\nthe new David\nHockney exhibition\nat Tate Britain is a\nmarvel. Nearly 150\npieces spanning\nthe breadth of Hockney\u2019s\ncareer \u2013 paintings, sketches,\nphotography, video, and\ndrawings \u2013 have been\nassembled in a thirteen-room\nexperience. Many of the\npieces have been borrowed\nfrom David Hockney Inc., or\nare owned by the Tate itself,\nbut an extraordinary number\nhave been sourced from other\nart museums \u2013 V&A, MoMA,\nThe Metropolitan Museum\nof Art, Smithsonian, Ludwig\nMuseum etc. \u2013 and at least\nonly under the gaze of a real\nhuman eye. No matter how\nlong you stare at the images\nonline, Hockney\u2019s art, as with\nall great art, can only be fully\nappreciated in the flesh.\nFor a Hockney aficionado,\nhowever, much magic in this\nexhibition lies in the smaller\nworks \u2013 sketches, drafts,\nideas \u2013 that find their soul\nlurking in later masterpieces.\nThe sixth room, \u2018Closer\nLooking\u2019 contains a multitude\nof such pieces from 1960\n\u2013 1999. Here, one can see\nthe beginnings of Savings\nand Loans Building (1967)\nin the 1966 drawing Place\ndes Canons, Beirut (1966)\nand the unmistakable style\nof Centre-Jour in the French\nStyle (1974), in Window,\nGrand Hotel, Vittel (1970).\nThe room also contains this\nreviewer\u2019s favourite find in\nthe exhibition: The Great\nPyramid with Palm Tree and\nCar (1963) \u2013 a piece of\ntriangular graph paper, on\nwhich the artist has sketched\na crude tree and car \u2013 which\nitself serves as the draft for\nGreat Pyramid at Giza with\nBroken Head from Thebes\n(1963). Sadly, the latter does\nnot make an appearance at\nthe Tate, although it did pass\nthrough Christie\u2019s in 2013 for\n\u00a33.5m.\nWhile the evolution of\nHockney\u2019s method is evident\nthroughout, so too \u2013 though\nmore subtly \u2013 is his retention\nof stylistic elements, themes,\nand muses. Long winding\nroads and rapid perspective\nshifts between the foreground\nand background are used\ncontinuously from Arizona\n(1964) to Going Up to Garrowby Hill (2000). And of the\nrecurring characters in the\nworks, Hockney\u2019s mother and\nPaul Kasmin \u2013 the art dealer\nwho discovered a young\nDavid in the sixties \u2013 share\nthe good fortune of being\ndepicted in both painting and\nphotography.\nOne may be forgiven for\nassuming the real meat of\nthe exhibit lies in the middle\nrooms, but given both\nHockney\u2019s proficiency and\ncreativity right up to present\n\u2013 the most recent works here\nwere completed just last year\n\u2013 this is far from the case. The\nAdam Gellatly\nDavid Hockney is on at the Tate\nModern until 29th\nMay.\nTickets \u00a317\n.70 adults; \u00a315.90\nDavid Hockney, Portrait of an Artist\nwith Two Figures \\\\ David Hockney,\nPrivate Collection\nfinal room in the exhibition\nshowcases the artist\u2019s recent\niPad drawings. Here, backlit\nscreens display not only the\nfinal product but also the\nevolution of the drawings\nin the form of screen-cap-tured videos. The audience\nhas the rare chance to see\nHockney\u2019s \u2013 or any artist\u2019s\nfor that matter \u2013 mind in\naction. On the iPad, Hockney\nrepeatedly adds layer upon\nlayer of different shades to\ntransform the often-harsh\ndigital palette into something\nfar more agreeable to the\neye. On larger works, he\nconstantly jumps across the\nworkspace; adding small\n\\\\ Few would\nquestion Hockney\u2019s\nreputation as one of\nthe most important\nand influential British\nartists of the last half-century \\\\\ndetails to a hand, followed by\na change in lighting to a jug,\nand then back to the hand.\nAnd most interestingly of all\nhe never erases, never clicks\n\u2018undo\u2019. If the structure of an\nobject no longer works, it is\nsimply drawn over and buried\nbeneath the new layer.\nFew would question\nHockney\u2019s reputation as one\nof the most important and\ninfluential British artists of\nthe last half-century. In many\nways, then, this exhibition\nserves more as a reaffirma-tion of the fact, as opposed\nto the revelation of it. What is\nrevealed to large audiences\nfor the first time, however,\nis not only Hockney\u2019s willingness to embrace new\nmediums and styles but to\nharness and mould them in\nsuch a way that they become\nas quintessentially \u2018Hockney\u2019\nas his paintings from the sev-enties. And he\u2019s still doing it.\nAnd he\u2019s nearly 80. And it\u2019s\nbrilliant.\nHockney\nmakes a splash\nat this Tate\nBritain retrospective\n\\\\ No matter how\nlong you stare at\nthe images online,\nHockney\u2019s art, as\nwith all great art,\ncan only be fully\nappreciated in the\nflesh \\\\\na third have been obtained\nfrom private collections. The\nteam at the Tate deserve a\ngreat deal of credit in the\norganisation of this, the\nlargest ever arrangement of\nHockney\u2019s work.\nThe exhibition moves chronologically through Hockney\u2019s\ncareer, with each of the rooms\nhighlighting a significantly\ndifferent period in the artist\u2019s\nwork. Many of Hockney\u2019s\nmost famous works are on\ndisplay \u2013 A Bigger Splash\n(1967), American Collectors\n(1968), Mr and Mrs Clark\nand Percy (1970-1), Pearblossom Hwy. (1986) \u2013 images\nso embedded in 20th\nCentury\nart history one does not\nexpect to uncover any new\ndetails. It comes as somewhat\nof a surprise then when, for\nexample, the background\nfauna of the L.A. hills in\nPortrait of an Artist (Pool with\nTwo Figures) (1972) glistens\nunder the exhibition lights: a\ndance choreographed into\nthe painting, with the explicit\ninstruction to be performed\n\n"

But the overall impact\nthe fashion industry has on\nour planet is shocking. The\nproduction of clothing has\nbeen estimated to account\nfor 10% of total carbon\nimpact. The fashion industry is\narguably the second greatest\nfuel is guzzled transporting\nclothes. But, we do know that\nin the US only 2% of clothing\nis domestically produced and\nglobally 90% of fabrics are\ntransported by cargo ship.\nA single ship can produce as\nmuch atmospheric pollution\nas 50 million cars in just one\nyear.\nAnother major factor is\ncheap synthetic fibres increasingly replacing natural cotton\nor wool. Polyester and nylon\nare both non-biodegrada-ble, energy intensive, and\nmade from petrochemicals.\nPolyester is rapidly increasing\nin value and is now in over\nhalf of all clothing. Nylon is\nabsorbent and breathable,\nso perfect for making those\nsuper cute yoga pants. But\nnylon production forms\nnitrous oxide, a greenhouse\ngas 310 times stronger than\ncarbon dioxide (not so cute).\nViscose is another synthetic\nwhich is derived from wood\npulp, and the material\u2019s popularity in fashion has caused\ndeforestation in Brazil and\nIndonesia. This is significant\nas the rainforest is often\ndescribed as the \u2018lungs of the\nearth\u2019 \u2013 acting as our most\neffective carbon sink and providing oxygen in return.\nEven when stepping away\nfrom synthetics, cotton\nis hardly innocent. It is\nincredibly water intensive\naccounting for 2.6% of global\nwater use. It takes 2,000\nlitres of water to produce the\naverage cotton t-shirt. Further,\n99.3% of cotton growth uses\nfertilizers, which can cause\nrunoff and eutrophication\nof waterways.

The\nwestern world hunts down a\nsale as our ancestors chased\nprey in the wilderness. High\ndemand produces 150 billion\nitems of clothing annually,\nwhich globally equates to 20\nnew items per person every\nyear. Then, on average each\ngarment is worn only seven\ntimes before being dumped\nin a landfill. Worse still, in the\nUK alone \u00a337.5 billion worth\nIncreasingly, high-end designers are turning eco fashion\nfrom hippy to haute with\nendorsements from celebri-ties, including Mark Ruffalo,\nEmma Watson and Stella\nMcCartney. This is a small yet\nsignificant thread of hope.\nBut what can us mere students do when we don\u2019t have\nthousands to splurge on a\ntee? I\u2019ll spare you the lecture\non conscious consumerism\nas it\u2019s clear that we need to\nloose our societal obsession\nwith buying the latest catwalk\ntrend and wear our clothes\nfor longer. But, when you\nneed new clothes, opting\nfor Fair Trade or organic\nfabrics is a simple way to\nease pesticide pollution and,\nin the case of cotton, reduce\nwater consumption by 60%. If\nyour heart still throbs for high\nstreet style, then look to the\nH&M Conscious line which\nuses sustainably sourced or\nrecycled materials.

Even ignoring\nthe human rights abuses and\nanimal suffering, the impact\nof our disposable dress is\ndire. People need to be taking\nfashion more seriously, not\nless.\nThe lack of sustainability in\nfashion can be blamed on\nfour major factors. Firstly,\nthere is enormous energy\nconsumption associated with\nclothing. Production is concentrated in countries such as\nBangladesh and China. Here,\nfactories are powered by\ncoal plants before garments\nare shipped to the rest of the\nworld. It is difficult to find\nreliable data on how much\nof clothing is hidden in our\nclosets unused and unloved.\nFaced with issues of energy\nconsumption, the rise of\nsynthetics, water consump-tion, and fast fashion it\u2019s\neasy to feel powerless.\nBut, with increased scrutiny\ncomes sustainable solutions.\nof cotton in the world, is the\nposter boy of cotton catastro-phe. In the 1950s, two rivers\nwere diverted from the Aral\nSea as a source of irrigation\nfor cotton production. As the\nsea dried up, it also became\nover-salinated and laden with\npesticides and fertilizer from\nagricultural runoff. Contaminated dust from the bare, dry\nlake-bed saturated the air,\ncreating a public health crisis\nand settling onto farmland.\nThis also has the knock-down\neffect of making the regional\nclimate more extreme with\n\\\\ The production\nof clothing has\nbeen estimated to\naccount for 10%\nof total carbon\nimpact \\\\\n\\\\ Even when\nstepping away\nfrom ssynthetics,\ncotton is hardly\ninnocent \\\\\ncolder winters and hotter\nsummers. Currently, water\nlevels in the Aral are less\nthan 10% of what they were\n50 years ago. Whilst this is a\ndramatic example of cotton\nfarming, similar environmental mayhem can be seen\nglobally.\n\n"

Based on, of all things, a James\nPaterson novel, this series chronicles a world thrown increasingly into turmoil\nas animals everywhere rebel and begin some sort of coordinated attack on\nhumanity. In the midst of this, a ragtag bunch of scientists, reporters, and safari\nrangers band together in an attempt to sort it all out. Everything about Zoo tries\ndesperately to take itself seriously despite itself. What results is an absurdist\u2019s wet\ndream.\nZoo\nPlanet Earth II\nThe sequel to one of the most critically acclaimed nature documentaries of all\ntime, this latest David Attenborough offering was 10 years in the making. This\nseries excelled at highlighting the drama and tension in the seemingly mun-dane, with the first episode\u2019s lizard sequence rapidly achieving memetic status.\nSampling stunning natural beauty from around the world on an unprecedented\nscale, the series is a must watch for any aficionados of the natural world.\nProduced by Bob Saget of all people, this comedy show chronicles the lives\nof various animals that inhabit New York City. Featuring a rotating cast of\ncomedians, episodes are largely improvised, with participants only being\ngiven an overview beforehand. Animals does not squander its premise,\ninstead taking full advantage of the unique opportunities offered by the\nindividual animals\u2019 characteristics. The HBO production credit draws in top\ncomedians, and the show offers some excellent surreal humour.\nAnimals\nSpy in the Wild\nA slightly unique spin on the classic nature documentary, Spy in the Wild\nhinges around a series of animatronic spy cameras. These faux-animals are\nused to infiltrate herds, and, in-theory, give a never before seen insight into the\nanimals\u2019 group dynamics. The series recently made headlines for a sequence\nwhere monkeys are apparently so convinced of a camera\u2019s authenticity, they\nhave a funeral for it when it breaks down. Plus, it\u2019s narrated by David Tennant;\nwho could ever tire of that voice?\nRemember the good old days, when we had the environment themed shows like Captain Planet?

Simran Kukran, a\nwelfare representative for the\nRSMU, argued that no one\ncares and council should be a\nplace to discuss more pressing\nissues. The RSMU president\nalso questioned the point of\ncreating rules to regulate an\nactivity that only a handful\nof students participate in. The\ndisagreement between CUs\nprompted DPCS, James Cowx\nto ask the CU presidents to\ntalk it out before bouncing\nthe paper for a second time.\nLooks like the mascotry paper\nlives to die another day.\nT\nhe age-old Imperial\ntradition of mascot\nstealing(alsoknown\nas mascotry) was\nonce again brought\nup at Union Council\non Monday, in an attempt to\ncreate a new, contemporary\nset of rules to regulate the\ncompetitive \u2018sport\u2019.\nMascotry involves the theft\nof the various antique items\nthat each of the constituent\nunions (CUs) possesses i.e.\ntheir mascots. The mascots\ngo from \u2018violate\u2019 to \u2018inviolate\u2019\ndepending on whether their\ntheft is permitted or not.\nThe mascots come in all\nshapes and sizes and include\nBolt (a 68lb wheel nut), its\nsibling Spanner (a 64lb brass\nspanner manufactured to fit\nthe bolts on Tower Bridge\nperfectly), Davy (a three-foot high, 132lb brass and\naluminium mining lamp),\nTheta (a seven-foot long steel\nthermometer which according\nto the RCSU costs \u00a3 10,000),\nand Phoenix (a six foot tall\nbird suit). These are the crown\njewels of CGCU, RSMU, RCSU,\nand ICSMU respectively.\nThe paper was a followup to one presented in\nNovember by Andrew Olson\n(Council Ordinary Member,\nUndergraduate Faculty of\nEngineering), in which it was\nproposed to make all mascots\ninviolate (i.e. unstealable).\nThe paper was rejected but\nCouncil agreed to reevaluate\nthe existing rules at a future\npoint.\nTherevisedpaperarguedthat\nthe current rules are outdated\nand that the vagueness has\ncaused disagreements (with\nCU members reportedly\ngetting roughed up by rival\nCU members) in the past.\nThe original 1999 rule book\nhas only been signed by\nCGCU and RCSU, leaving it\nambiguous as to the rules that\nRSMU/ICSMU \u2018play\u2019 by.\nThe proposed rules redefine\nwhat counts as a mascot,\nwhat counts as a steal and the\nprotocol for demands after a\nsteal. The ICU President is also\nto be the nominated \u2018referee\u2019\nwho will preside over all\ndisputes. But the key changes\nconcern safety and suggest\nmeasures to prevent injury\nand damage to mascots and\nCollege Property.\nMascotry has a long history,\nespecially between CGCU,\nRSMU and RCSU (ICSMU\u2019s\nPhoenix wasn\u2019t around until\n2009), and tales of cunning\nstunts can be found littered\nthroughout past issues of\nfelix. Raids involving fire\nextinguishers, hordes of\nstudents, and car chases\ndown Exhibition Road have\noccurred in the past so a few\nrules could help prevent it all\nfrom getting out of hand.\nBut the presentation of the\npaper saw many students\nKing\u2019s Fossil Free leads to student arrest\nA\nnyone that\u2019s\nbeen around\nImperial a\nwhile will\nremember the\nFossil Free\nCampaign posters that went\nup during first term a few\nyears ago. These declared\n\u201cImperial\u2019s getting coal for\nChristmas\u201d as part of a larger\ncampaign to try and get\nImperial to divest from fossil\nfuels. Whilst the Imperial\ngroup for this movement has\nbecome slightly quieter on\ncampus lately, the national\nmovement is going strong.\nLast week over forty students\ndecorated the front of King\u2019s\nCollege London with balloons,\nflowers and poster paint\ndots in part of a gradually\nescalating campaign of action\nwith the aim of getting King\u2019s\nCollege London to divest from\nFossil fuels.\nThe poster paint dots relate\nback to action from the last\nweek of Autumn term when\nstudents sprayed 1000 chalk\ndots around the internal walls\nof King\u2019s College to represent\nthe need to \u2018connect the dots\u2019\non climate change. The point\nthe campaign was trying\nto make, was the need for\nlooking beyond polar bears\nand realising that the 2\u00baC\ntemperatures limit that\u2019s on\ntrack to be exceeded in a\nmatter of years, will lead to an\nexponential increase in forest\nfires, floods, droughts, storms\nand sea levels.\nAt the start of this term, Roger\nHallam, a PhD candidate in the\nDepartment of Culture Media\nand Creative Industries, spray\nAbigail de Bruin\nThat thermometer reportedly cost \u00a310,000 \\\\ Imperial College London\n\\\\ Raids involving\nfire extinguishers,\nhordes of students,\nand car chases\ndown Exhibition\nRoad have occurred\nin the past \\\\\npainted \u201cDivest from Oil and\nGas Now \u2013 Out of Time\u201d on\nthe front of King\u2019s.

Well then I have just\nthe thing for you. A sport for\nthose who fancy carrying\nthe ball like rugby, but prefer\na rounder shape. For those\nwho fancy bouncing it every\nnow and again, but also\nwant the luxury of booting it\ninto the net. A sport played\nwith enormous teams but on\nsuitably large pitches. I give\nyou, Gaelic football.\nIt\u2019s a sport many have heard\nof but very few play. As the\nname suggests, it\u2019s huge in\nIreland and is slowly starting\nto leak onto our television\nscreens if you\u2019re lucky enough\nto have premium channels.\nIt incorporates numerous\nelements from a number of\ndifferent sports, fulfilling my\npromise above. 15 men take\nto pitches larger than that\nof rugby with two goals at\neither end. These aren\u2019t any\nordinary nets, but hybrid foot-ball-rugby structures through\nwhich points can be scored\nby passing the ball into either\nelement. Players can carry\nthe ball in a similar fashion to\nrugby, but must either bounce\nor \u2018solo\u2019 it (kicking off the foot\nback into the hands) every\nfour steps. You must advance\ndown the pitch, with very little\ncontact available to defenders other than intercepting\nor one-hand tackling, after\nwhich attackers can make\nan attempt on goal either\nthrough the posts (one point)\nor into the net (three points).\nSimple right? Well, yeah it is\nactually.\nI mean no insult to those\nwho play, as with any sport\nthere are complex tactics\nand strategies involved, but\nthis is mostly due to the lack\nof tackling opportunities and\nease of movement over such a\nlarge area. But this statement\nisn\u2019t made naively, I went to\na session in Hyde Park on a\nwet Wednesday to try out this\nclassic Irish sport. Spoiler: I\nmay well be going again.\nAfter a brief but tiring warm\nup (I really need to get fit if\nI\u2019m going to continue these\ngive-it-a-go sessions) we\u2019re\nstraight into some practice\ndrills. There are only a few\nplayers at the session, but\nthere\u2019s enough team spirit\nand banter for three times\nthe numbers present. I\u2019m\nkeen to add, and would be\nremiss not to mention, that it\nwas a mixed session with no\nsegregation at all. Admittedly only one female was\npresent, but she was given no\nspecial treatment and rightly\nso. I digress. The drills are\nnon-stop and comprehensive,\nwith clear aims and transferable skills. I am instantly\nimpressed with their ability\nto run sessions with very little\nequipment and space; even\nthose with little experience in\nthe sport can enjoy a good\nfitness regime and improved\ndexterity which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll\nagree are pivotal in most ball\ngames. Those who regularly\nplay football or rugby would\nbenefit from such a sport. Not\nthat I\u2019m suggesting you moonlight with Gaelic football but,\nyou know, you could.\nWe practice pass and\nmove, team communication\nand sprint exercises. This is\nfollowed by defender pur-suits, where you learn how to\nnavigate the limited tackling\nallowances within the game.\nHere I can boast some suc-cess, as I surprised the chap\nrunning the session by twisting and turning the defender\ninto a whirlwind of confusion.\nThere might be some embellishment here but hey, I excel\nat few sports so I\u2019ll take the\nwin. It was soon overturned\nwhen the roles were reversed,\nas I let the defender get away\nwithout even catching up to\nhim. Kind reprise or sluggish\nrunning? You decide.\nWe soon move onto\nhalf-pitch practice runs.\nSplit into defenders and\nattackers, those running at\nthe goal practice manoeuvres\ndesigned to draw the backs\nout creating space for a\nwell-aimed punt between the\nrugby-style posts or ideally, a\ndrill into the net. Once again,\nnew game. It\u2019s a sport with\nbenefits for those who desire\nto improve their fitness whilst\nenjoying great team spirit.\nYou learn important off-the-ball skills, like losing your\nmarker and creating space\non what can become a very\ncrowded pitch. Whilst chatting with the other players,\nI\u2019m told other universities\ninvite other sports teams to\njoint their practice sessions.\nRugby players would benefit\nfrom improved ball-carrying\nand footwork, footballers\nwould improve their shots on\ngoal under pressure and bas-ketballers will\u2026 bounce more.\nAnyway, here\u2019s a sport that\nencompasses multiple skills\nand has a rich history within\nthe British Isles. The number\nof people who turned up to\nthis session wouldn\u2019t constitute\na full Gaelic team, a travesty\nconsidering there are few\nmatch commitments due to\na lack of teams around the\ncountry. The benefits far outweigh the time commitments,\nand all the skills you learn are\ntransferable to a variety of\nscenarios. I\u2019ve said it before\nand I wholeheartedly mean it\nagain, go along and give this\na go. Amateurs have nothing\nto worry about, seasoned\nsports players have nothing\nto lose.\n\\\\ I hear whispers of\n\u201cWow\u201d around me,\nbut I\u2019m sure it was\njust the wind \\\\\nI\u2019m given the opportunity to\nsee if any Irish blood runs\nthrough my veins. Placed in\nthe forward position, I move\nwith ballet-like grace around\nthe defenders. Ducking and\ndiving around the quagmire\nwe\u2019ve lovingly called the\ngoal-mouth, I find some space\nand the ball in my hand. I turn\ntowards the goal, set myself\nup and blast it into the bottom\ncorner. I hear whispers of\n\u201cWow\u201d around me, but I\u2019m\nsure it was just the wind. I\u2019m\nabsolutely loving this; I get\nto relive past memories of\nfootball which have slipped\naway from me and learn a\nICDanceslaysatSouthernUniversities\nD\nancing is\na sport?\nOf course!\nAfter months\nof intense\ntraining, IC\nDance\u2019s Ballroom and Latin\nDancesport teams travelled\nto Cardiff last weekend\nfor a clash of the southern\nuniversities. This is one of\nthe most eagerly anticipated\ncompetitions of the year, a\ncrucial step before the UKwide competition in Blackpool\nat the end of February. Vying\nwith universities as far as\nExeter and Southampton\n(as well as the powerhouses\nCambridge and Oxford),\nImperial made an extremely\nstrong showing, with dancers\nat all levels giving top-notch\nperformances.\nDancesport competition\noperates on a unique knockout system. Couples are\ncategorised by ability and\nfrom then on it is a battle to\nremain on the floor \u2013 a panel\nof judges ruthlessly eliminates\naround half the competitors\nduring each round. Stamina is\ntherefore crucial. With each\nround it becomes harder to\nmaintain the same energy\nand sharpness, and yet the\npressure mounts as fewer and\nfewer dancers remain.\nFor the IC Beginners team,\nSUDC was only the second\nmajor official competition\nthey had attended. Benjamin\nBiggs and Kerys Borg stood\nout with their phenomenal\nperformance in the beginners\ncategory. Despite strong\ncompetition from Oxford,\nCambridge and Cardiff, they\nbeat 68 other couples to\nemerge as champions in both\nballroom categories, waltz\nand quickstep. Amazingly,\nBen and Kerys did it all over\nagain in the Latin competi-tions, winning both jive and\ncha for a clean sweep of four\nfirst place medals! An absolutely stellar performance\nfrom this promising beginner\ncouple.\nOf the more advanced cou-ples, many were competing\ntogether for the first time last\nweekend. IC Dance lost several dancers to injuries and\nother commitments after Nottingham Varsity in November,\nforcing a reshuffle of dancers\non the team. Undeterred by\nthe limited time they had to\npractice, the newly-minted\ncouples did remarkably well\non the floor. Devon Anthony\nand Stephanie Rathmann\ncame in fourth in Novice\nBallroom despite being\npartners for little more than a\nmonth. Meanwhile, Barnaby\nPaul and Anastassia Rajapu\ndeserve a special mention for\nmaking it to the semifinals of\nNovice Latin with what must\nbe the record for the shortest\npreparation time ever \u2013 their\nroutines were made up on the\nday itself!\nFirst and third places in\nNovice Latin were claimed\nby Imperial couples: Oliver\nJiang and Mariya Pozdeyeva\nwere the undisputed champi-ons, with an unanimous top\nrank from every judge on\nthe panel \u2013 an event almost\nunprecedented in the often\nhotly contested finals. Junyi\nHou and Sarah McMullan\nwere neck and neck with a\ncouple from Exeter but were\nnarrowly edged out for a\ncommendable third.\nAt the Intermediate level,\nDevon Anthony and his Latin\npartner Freya Thomas seized\ntheir first competition win at\nSUDC last weekend with their\nskill in cha, jive and paso\ndoble. They are a well-es-tablished partnership; both\nstarted dancing as beginners\nin IC Dance two years ago\nand placed sixth in Novice\nLatin at Inter-Varsity after\npartnering up last year. Since\nthen they have gone from\nstrength to strength.\nContrasting them in Intermediate Ballroom were Sirawit\nIttisoponpisan and Yue Shi,\nwho have only been dancing\ntogether since December.\nThey faced off against five\ncouples from Cambridge (and\none Bristolian couple) in the\nfinals to come in fifth place\nin waltz, Viennese waltz and\nquickstep.\nIn Advanced Latin, Tianci\nMa & Adela Capilnasiu\nnabbed yet another first place\nfor Imperial, triumphing over\neleven other couples with\ntheir excellent performance\nin four dances: cha, rumba,\npaso doble and jive. Slavina\nGeorgieva, an Imperial\nalumna, and her partner\nballroom partner Sarah\nMcMullan also competed\nin Acrobatic Rock N\u2019 Roll,\ncoming in sixth with their\neffortless stunts and energetic\ndancing.\nFinally, the day concluded\nwith the team match: each\nparticipating university sends\nseveral teams of four couples,\nwho dance separately in\nwaltz, quickstep, cha and jive.\nThey are judged together and\nprogress through the rounds\nas though they are a single\ncouple. Unlike the previous\nevents where individual\ncouples compete against\neach other, the team match\nis where universities go head\nto head on the dance floor.\nAfter four intense rounds of\ndancing, Imperial\u2019s A team\ncame in fourth out of 33\nteams representing universities at SUDC. Well done to\nthe dancers of the A team!\nThe whole IC Dance team\ncan be proud of their achievements at SUDC this year.\nMeanwhile anticipation is\nbuilding for the Inter-Varsity\nDance Competition, when\nthe Northern and Southern\nuniversities will convene for\nthe largest competition of the\nyear! Best wishes to IC Dance\nas they gear up for IVDC next\nweekend.\n\\\\ Imperial\u2019s A\nteam came in\nfourth out of 33\nteams representing\nuniversities at\nSUDC \\\\\nHenry Hesten also made\nfifth place in the gruelling\nAdvanced Latin (Ex-students)\ncategory, which assesses couples\u2019 prowess in all five Latin\ndances \u2013 the aforementioned\n4 and an additional dance,\nsamba.\nAs testament to IC Dance\u2019s\nversatility (and stamina!),\nHenry Hesten and his Claire Chan\n\n"

At the same\ntime, the world is worrying\nabout climate change,\ndesertification and pollution,\nand thus establishes goals and\nagreements in order to protect\nthe environment. A common\nsense view on the causality\nchain of the environmental\ndestruction reveals that our\nconsumer behaviour is at\nthe top of this chain and\nrepresents an essential factor\nwith regard to the changes of\nthe environment. Everyone\u2019s\ndaily life contains consumption\ndecisions which have a direct\nor indirect influence on the\nenvironment. While some\nthings seem obvious, others\nhave to be investigated more\ncarefully in order to trace\n\\\\ We are used to the\npermanent availability of all\nour desired products \\\\\nback their influence. In doing\nso, the whole life cycle of a\nproduct or a service has to be\ntaken into account.\nTo start off, what plays a\nmajor role in all our lives?\nFood! Our first association\nwith the environment might\nbe the consumption of animal\nproducts, which has come to\nthe fore due to the currently\nincreasing popularity of\nvegetarian/vegan lifestyles.\nAnimals need area to live.\nThey also need food, which\nin turn needs area and water\nto grow. The need for area \u2013\nwhich is particularly high for\ncattle ranching \u2013 results in the\ndeforestation of rainforests.\nHowever, the assumed\nsustainable lifestyle which\nexcludes the consumption of\nanimal products can have its\ndrawbacks: The increasing\ndemand for the avocado, with\nits vitamins and unsaturated\nfatty acids being one of the\nmost popular 'superfoods',\nis causing a loss of forest\nand needs huge amounts of\nwater (the cultivation of one\nkilogram of avocados needs\nmore than five times as much\nwater as one of tomatoes).\nBesides food, the mobile\nphone has become the\ncentre of our lives. The\nrapid development of new\ntechnologies leads to an\never-decreasing lifespan of\nour electronical devices: we\nreplace products because it\nis difficult to repair them or\nto benefit from technological\ninnovations. The problem is\nthat smartphones contain\nup to 60 different chemical\nelements (30 of which are\nmetals) whose extraction and\nsubsequent disposal cause\ncontamination of soil, water\nand air.\nSpeaking of contamination\nleads us to the consumption\nof fashion, which has\ntransformed into 'fast fashion'\nduring recent years, with\nvast quantities of clothes\nbeing produced at an ever\nincreasingfrequency(clothing\nproduction doubled from\n2000 to 2014). To point out\njust one of the issues with this,\nthe immense need for water\nin cotton production resulted\nin the reduction in area and\nwater level of the Aral Sea by\n50% from 1950/60 to 2007.\nIssues connected to that\ninclude the contamination of\ngroundwater and agricultural\nproducts due to sand storms.\nAnother aspect of our\nlives that has come to feel\nperfectly natural is travelling.\nHow long ago was your last\n\\\\ There are\nnumerous and very\neasy approaches\nto starting a\nmore conscious\nand sustainable\nconsumption \\\\\nlong-distance journey? For\nme, its's less than a year.\nOne problem with tourism\nis the transportation to the\ndestination: the aeroplane\nis the biggest transportation\npolluter, releasing the most\nCO2\nemissions per passenger\nkilometre and being used\nfor the longest distances.\nAn additional aspect is the\non-site influence of tourism,\nincluding land degradation\nand the overuse of resources\nlike land, fresh water, and\nenergy.\nThese examples show how\nwe can be confronted with\nconsumption decisions every\nday. The way we consume\nthings as a matter of course\ncan be challenged by tracing\nback the upstream and\ndownstream impacts of our\nconsumption decisions both\non the environment and\nliving things. For me, it is not\nabout choosing a radical\nlifestyle and committing\nmyself to the abstinence\nof all kinds of enjoyment.\nThe human being strives to\nhedonism, social affiliation\nand self-actualisation and the\nconsumption of the discussed\nproducts and services makes\na contribution to satisfying\nthese needs. For me, it is\nabout starting to reflect our\nmanner of consuming things\nand to find a balance between\nuncontrolledconsumptionand\nforgoing. There are numerous\nand very easy approaches to\nstarting a more conscious and\nsustainable consumption. If\nyou haven\u2019t had a coffee yet\ntoday, why not use a reusable\ncup instead of throwing away\nthe paper cups each time?\nWhy not take the train from\ntime to time instead of the\nplane for short distances?\nWhy not trying to repair the\nhole in your jeans instead of\nthrowing it away or even look\nfor a more durable garment\nnext time?\n\\\\ The cultivation\nof one kilogram of\navocados needs\nmore than five times\nas much water as\none of tomatoes \\\\\n\\\\ How long ago\nwas your last long-distance journey? \\\\\nBeing Black\nand Muslim\nin the UK\nMohamed Omer discusses his\nintersecting identities\nT\nhe US is what\nmost of us think of\nwhen we think of\nBlack Civil Rights,\nwhich is where the\nmovement was the\nmost prominent, but seldom do\nwe realise or remember what\npeople in our own communities\ngo through. The recent race\nrow at Oxford University,\nin which students received\nan email from staff warning\nthem to be 'vigilant' because\na black graduate, Femi\nNylander, was seen walking\nthrough college grounds, is\na true wake-up call. Another\ninvestigation last January was\ncalled at Cardiff University\nafter 32 undergraduates\nwere suspended from clinical\npractice, after several others of\nAfrican heritage, complained\nabout a play performance\nwhere a medical student\n\u201cblacked up\u201d to impersonate\na lecturer. Suddenly the wake-up call becomes an edgy,\n\\\\ As a Black Muslim, I also\ndraw hope, optimism and\nstrength from my faith \\\\\nmax-volume Monday-morning\nalarm. These are two of many\nexamples from the university\n(Latin: universitas, \"a whole\")\nscene \u2013 yet we\u2019re supposed\nto be on the side of New Year\nwhere the grass is greener.\nSeptember 2017 sees the\nlaunch of the Black Studies\ncourse at Birmingham City\nUniversity, the first of its kind\nin all of Europe. Given that\nBlack Studies has been a\npart of US higher education\nsince campaigning during\nthe 1960s, the availability\nof courses in the UK is long\noverdue.\nCampaigns such as Why is\nmy Curriculum White? show\nthat these hopes are mirrored by students. A survey\nconducted in 2014 by the\nNUS Black Students Campaign found that, \"42% did\nnot believe their curriculum\nreflected issues of diversity,\nequality and discrimination.\"\nThis did later lead to Universities Scotland producing the\nrace equality toolkit, Embedding Race Equality into the\nCurriculum, and OCR rolled\nout a new module in GCSE\nHistory called Migration to\nBritain c. 1,000 to c. 2010,\nhighlighting early Black\npresence in Britain. Steps forward and yet we are moving\nbackwards \u2013 maybe we are\njust moonwalking?\nI personally believe debates\nare won on the ground, with\ngrassroots activism and\nwith the patience to stand\nface-to-face with your oppo-nent, bear their insults, then\nconvince them that they were\nmistaken.\nThe problem is, we have\nsome walls in our own social\nstructures. As a Black Muslim\nmyself, with a bristling black\nbeard, I really do feel locked\nin a cage that contains me\nand my painful silence. That\nis, me speaking out would not\nbe seen as \u2018grassroots activism\u2019. Instead, I would simply\nbe lending to the stereotype\nof an aggressive Black man\nor terrorist. The most hurtful\nof these experiences happen\nwhen my mother is involved.\nShe may be driving along,\nthen as she looks over her\nshoulder in that elegant\nhijab, she would be met with\na terrifying racial slur from\nthe driver on the right. And\nit\u2019s so frustrating in those situations when I know I can\u2019t do\nanything about it. If you turn\nto the driver and say \u201cHello\nthere\u201d, he may accuse you\nof blurting \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d\n(I have seen this happen to\nothers before, and so you just\ndo nothing.\nBut, as a Black Muslim, I\nalso draw hope, optimism\nand strength from my faith.\nPersonally, I look to those\nmoments when my Prophet\nMuhammad received\ncomplaints from a Black\ncompanion that another\ncompanion made a racist\nremark, so Muhammad\nrebuked the offender \u201cYou\nare a man in whom there\nis some Jahiliyyah (ignorance)\u201d. That transformative\npower completely changed\nthe sentiments and views of\nan entire nation within the\nspan of a 23 year struggle.\n\\\\ For me, speaking\nout would not be\nseen as 'grassroots\nactivism'. Instead,\nI would simply\nbe lending to the\nstereotye of an\naggressive Black\nman or terrorist \\\\\nThe culmination of this was\nwhen Muhammad stood up\non Mount Arafah and delivered the famous Farewell\nSermon (included in the Folio\nBook of Historic Speeches),\namong the final few words\nhe imparted on the listeners\nwere:\n\u201c\u2026 An Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab nor a\nnon-Arab has any superiority\nover an Arab; also a white\nhas no superiority over black\nnor a black has any superiority over white except by piety\nand good action.\u201d\nA most profound state-ment, which we learnt from\nour childhood days in the\nmosque, and have never forgotten since. And the whole\nstory teaches me that no\nmatter how big the hurdle is,\nwith patience and perseverance any reform is possible.\nNowadays, there are those\nwho say religion belongs in\nthe past, but based on my\nexperiences, I can say that\nmy Islam is very relevant to\nmy blackness. It is a pool\nof inspiration for me as a\nBlack man, and it provides a\ntimeless framework for how\npeople of all ethnicities can\ncome to know each other.\nMahatma Gandhi did say:\n\u201cWhen I closed the second\nvolume (of the Prophet\u2019s\nbiography), I was sorry there\nwas not more for me to read\nof that great life.\u201d\nNext week sees Imperial\nACS collaborating with ISoc\nto explore the fascinating\nrelationship between Islam\nand Black History during\nImperial's Discover Islam\nWeek.\n\\\\ My Islam is very\nrelevant to my\nblackness. It is a pool\nof inspiration for me\nas a Black man, and it\nprovides a framework\nfor how people of all\nethnicities can come\nto know each other \\\\\n\n"

Blah.Blah.Blah\nfelixonline.co. uk /comment comment.felix@ic.ac.uk\nC O M M E N T\nDivyen Vanniasegaram condemns\nthe votes as a replacement for\neffective democracy\nR\neferendums have\nbeen leading,\nand will continue\nto lead, to the\nslow erosion of\nP a r l i a m e n t a r y\nsovereignty. The UK is a\nParliamentary representative\ndemocracy, where\nthe electorate elect a\nrepresentative from their\nconstituency to represent them\nin Parliament. These members\nof parliament should vote and\nact in good conscience and in\nwhat they believe is in the best\ninterest of their constituents;\nwe do not elect delegates to\nput across our everyday whims\non every single issue. Anna\nSoubry MP made this exact\npoint during the debate on\ntriggering Article 50, saying\nthat she did not go through\nthe lobbies voting for what she\nbelieved in but rather what she\nhad promised her constituents.\nFor too long, MPs have been\nwilling to use sloppy arguments\nto justify the use of referen-dums, such as 'giving power to\nthe people', whilst displaying\ncomplete disregard for their duties as MPs\nand shifting responsibility for decisions from\nthemselves onto the public. Referendums\nintroduce a competing force of sovereignty\nto Parliament \u2013 an alternative way for the\npeople to have their say \u2013 and whilst this\nappears to give the people greater choice\nand control over their lives, it merely allows\nsimplistic populistic sentiments to dominate.\nThis was seen on both sides of the debate\nin the recent EU referendum. Referendums\nessentially allow for a tyranny of the major-ity, no matter how slim, to dictate what\nhappens, and without the safeguards that\nParliament allows for this would lead to\nslow erosion of rights for minority groups.\nParliament is a far better medium through\nwhich to make key decisions, where members can have hours of debate followed by\nscrutiny by committees, and decisions not\nonly have to pass through the Commons\nbut the Lords as well, adding further safeguards against rash and unwise decisions.\nReferendums not only lead to poor\noutcomes but also allow one topic to\neclipse all others: the referendum on\nleaving the EU was over seven months\nago and is still dominating the headlines.\nThis distracts us from other important\nissues of the day such as the strife of\nour NHS, prisons and housing. These\nare far more important to the prosperity\nof this country than our membership of\nthe EU.\nReferendums are incredibly divisive\nand for the unity of a country it is far\nbetter that the government and parliament make these decisions on our\nbehalf, as they are too important to\nbe used to sow division and contempt.\nThese divisions will be felt for years to\ncome and have fortified the feelings\nof separation between young and old,\nnorth and south, urban and non-urban,\nimmigrants and non-immigrants.\nThe people may have been able to\nmake their decision clear, but at what\ncost to Parliamentary sovereignty and\nto wider society?\nappointments. But so many people don't\nhave this, and I've witnessed people\ngiving up on their dreams of being a\ndoctor because they know they\u2019ll never\nbe able to afford to finish. There is some\nhelp available \u2013 the Student Support Fund\n(which you\u2019re helpfully emailed about as\nyou crawl towards the end, as though they\nknow you're facing hardship!) offers up to\n\u00a32,000 (sometimes a grant, sometimes a\nloan) for unexpected expenses. It\u2019s great\nthat they do this, but two grand doesn't\ngo very far when you're trying to fund an\naverage of around six months of expenses\nthat it's hard to argue were unexpected\nwhen everyone knows how expensive\nliving in London is, and how the system\nworks.\nSome supervisors are more helpful\nthan others \u2013 some help you find grant\nextensions, put you on other projects, or\nemploy you as research assistants, while\nothers misguidedly believe that a project\nwith three years of funding should take\nyou three years and if you don't manage\nto finish it in that time, it's your problem.\nIt shouldn't be the case that your very\nquality of life is dependent on whether\nyou get an empathetic supervisor, have a\npartner on whom you can be dependent,\nor have well-off parents who are willing\nto give you handouts, particularly when\nyou're in your late twenties.\nUnlike an undergraduate or master's\nReferendums\nare not\ndemocratic\n\\\\ I've been one of\nLondon's hidden homeless\nsince September, taking\nadvantage of the generosity\nof friends who put a roof\nover my head \\\\\ndegree, you don't do a PhD to\nget rich. People with PhDs will\nearn, on average over their\nlifetime, less than someone\nwith only a masters degree,\nthanks to these years of very\nlow income and a minimal\ndifference to later earnings.\nYou do a PhD because you're\npassionate about something,\nand it's easy to see how the\nprospect of years of just about\ngetting by could be off-putting\nand a huge barrier to entry for\nlower-income students, even\nwithout the challenges caused\nby inadequate support.\nOther countries do it better;\nthe UK is one of the only\ncountries where doctoral\ncandidates are treated like\nthis. In most countries, PhD\nstudies afford a level of respect\nthat brings with it a consistent\nand adequate salary. By\nforcing us into unpaid work,\nour background becomes\ncrucial, and those without the\nright background just don't\nhave the same opportunities.\nWhen postgraduate students\ndon't get equal treatment to\nour friends who got 'real jobs',\nthe system becomes inherently\nclassist. In the same way that\nthe working class were kept\nout of universities in the past,\nthey're still being forced out\nnow. Academia used to be a\nplace where the curious rich\ncould play, but we moved\non from that hundreds of\nyears ago, and now it\u2019s full of\npassionate people wanting to\nmake a difference and break\nnew grounds of knowledge.\nWhy do we insist that only the\nprivileged get the pleasure of\ndoing that?\n\\\\ And remember, even if you can\nraise enough money to support\nyourself by turning a trick here and\nthere, or tutoring rich GCSE students\nliving in Notting Hill, you can't move\nhouse, get a new phone contract,\nor do anything that requires a credit\ncheck, because you don't have a\nreportable income \\\\\nPostgraduate\nstudy is wrought\nwith classist\nundertones\n\\\\ The system is\ncompletely failing\nworking class students\nin postgraduate study \\\\\nTessa Davey explains why PhDs are\nnear-impossible to finance without\nfamily help\nT\nhe UK has a vast\nhistoric class divide\n\u2013 only those from\nthe upper-middle\nclasses who are in\nsevere denial about\nour country would go so\nfar as to say that class does\nnot remain a huge cultural\nbarrier today. Education has\ntraditionally been something\nfor the rich, and our modern\nhigher education system is\ndesigned to, in theory, reverse\nthis. Today, no one, politicians\nclaim, is prevented from\nattending university because\nthey can't afford it.\nAnd to some extent, this is\ntrue. I started university with\nan assessed family income well\nbelow the lowest threshold. I\ngot bursaries and loans; sure, I\nhave \u00a350,000 of debt that I\u2019m\ngoing to be paying off for the\nrest of my life, but at the time\nI wasn't lacking for money.\nThis class divide bit me in the\nbackside in other ways at\nImperial where, relative to the\nmajority of grammar school\nor privately-educated students\n(or even just those who went\nto good middle-class schools\nin south east England), my\nrural Welsh state education\njust didn't stack up, and I\nstruggled more than most.\nFurther to the educational\ndifficulties, socialising at a\nRussell Group university when\nyou're someone into whom\nentitlement and assertiveness\nhave not been bred can make\nyou a bit awkward at best,\nand a social pariah at worst.\nBut, all this aside, I was able\nto get a phenomenally well-respected undergraduate\ndegree, something that my\nparents certainly never did,\nand so, to some extent, the\nsystem works. Great.\nWhere the system\nis completely failing\nworking class students is in\npostgraduate study, and I\nthink Imperial is particularly\nguilty of ignoring this. The\nprocess of getting a doctorate\nis simply not designed for\nsomeone who is not able to\nself-fund at least part of their\nstudies, and this requirement\ncan be a dealbreaker \u2013\nparticularly when you want\nto study in the most expensive\nneighbourhood in the country.\nMost PhD students get the\nbasic annual stipend of about\n\u00a315,500 (although most DTCs\n(Doctoral Training Centres)\nand the Imperial scholarships\npay significantly more. Why,\nI wonder, are these students\ndeserving of more money?)\nwhich just about gets you a\nGradPad room and a handful\nof change. Sure, you can\nrent private accommodation,\nbut even then this amount of\nmoney is barely enough to\nscrape by on. Undergrads\nliving on much less money and\neating beans on toast every\nnight: yes, I hear you, but\nafter nine years at imperial I\ndeserve to be able to afford\na fucking burrito if I want one\n(and there are more legitimate\nreasons for us needing more\nmoney, such as needing\nsuitable attire for conferences,\nhaving families to support, and\nour daily coffee intake being\nsignificantly higher). Most\nPhD students, particularly\nthe poorer ones, tend to\nsupplement this with hours of\nGTAing, which takes up a huge\namount of time, and really\neats into your work, meaning\nlower quality research.\nAnd then, of course, there's\nthe matter of how long your\nfunding lasts. Although it's\nvery unusual (even for the\nbest student) to finish a PhD\ncompletely in three years\n(most take almost four),\nhuge numbers of us only\nget funding for three years.\nSome people manage to get\nfunding extensions, but, for\nmost, what it works out to is\nalmost a year of unpaid work.\nDoes that seem reasonable?\nOr more like slave labour?\nWe can't leave, because we\nneed to finish our degree, and\nunlike in other countries such\nas Germany, we can't claim\nbenefits because we're still\ntechnically students. And trust\nme, it takes this long. We're\nnot just faffing around and\ntaking our time because we're\ntoo comfortable.\nWith this unpaid component\nof your PhD being almost\na necessity, how can you\nprepare for it? You have\ncontaminates the glovebox:\nresearch is unpredictable and\nit's the ones at the bottom of\nthe ladder who are suffering\nfor it.\nA study by Swansea\nUniversity found that just\nunder 5% of students are\nin some way involved in\nthe sex industry. This may\nseem completely alien from\nour experience at an elite\nuniversity of predominately\nwealthy students, but even if\ntheir data is skewed, they still\ncollected data from thousands\nof students that demonstrates\nthat it\u2019s not a minor problem.\nI remember being surprised to\nread (in a different study) that\nno idea how long it will be,\nand you can\u2019t really save up\nearlier in your studies either.\nYou probably can\u2019t get a loan\nas you have no income, and\nso unless you're fortunate\nenough to have family or\nfriends who can support you,\nusually you're in a really\nsticky situation. And it's\nunpredictable; it can spring up\non anyone whose results are\ndelayed or unexpected. When\na colleague takes six months\nwriting their part of a paper,\nor your samples get destroyed\nwhen an MSci student\naround 10% of female PhD\nstudents turn to prostitution\ntowardstheendoftheirstudies.\nThis isn't really surprising. I\u2019ve\nseen final year PhD students\nwho are writing the most\nchallenging document of their\nlives, eking out a can of soup\nfor a full day, because they\ncan't afford to buy any more\nfood than that. I've been one\nof London\u2019s hidden homeless\nsince September, taking\nadvantage of the generosity\nof friends who put a roof over\nmy head (and often food in my\nbelly), and having short bursts\nin hostels when I can't find a\nplace to stay. London\u2019s hostels\nare full of people like me, all\nstuck. We have smartphones\nand nice clothes to wear,\nbut we're still scraping by at\nthe mercy of other people\u2019s\nkindness.\nAnd remember, even if you\ncan raise enough money to\nsupport yourself by turning\na trick here and there, or\ntutoring rich GCSE students\nliving in Notting Hill, you can't\nmove house, get a new phone\ncontract, or do anything\nthat requires a credit check,\nbecause you don't have a\nreportable income. Like many\nin London, you're stuck with\nillegal sublets on gumtree and\ndodgy jailbroken iPhones on\neBay, making you feel like you\ndon't quite belong anywhere.\nSome people are less\nfortunate than me. My father\nhas been scraping together\nand offering me every last\nspare penny, and my mother\nhas been insistent on sending\nme money for things like\ncontact lenses and dentist\n\\\\ We can't leave,\nbecause we need\nto finish our degree,\nand we can't claim\nbenefits because\nwe're still technically\nstudents \\\\\n\n"
