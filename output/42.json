    "content": "2 FELIX\nIt is customary to' Profile' the Retiring Editor of FELIX. After all, the Editor, while in office, can\nhave considerable influence over the Union: his views\nare as important as those of most Union officers. Thus\nit comes about that Stephen H. Wearne (the H.is said to stand for Hobft) faces the ordeal of exposure by an unflattering biographer.\nS.H. W. spent an unsettled early life at boarding\nschool and with relations, developing a considerable\ndegree of independence and adaptability. Owning nowhere\nas home, he chooses London as the only place where he is really comfortable. Apprenticed at 16 to the De\nHavilland School, he left after7 months to become an\narticle d apprentice to a London firm. His factory experiences showed him some of the frustrations of 'shop\nwork, and gave his politics a tilt from their right wing\npublic school tendencies. He did part time studying at\na technical college, from where he won a scholarship to\nWoolwich Polytechnic, after having the unusual experience of being Union Secretary, and winding up a Union\nat the end of its emergency (war) full time student\nsupport. At Woolwich he rose to l st Class Honours by\nway of magazine Editor, VicePresident,( sinecure) and\nvarious social club jobs. He wrote a radio script for\nRussian consumption telling of the life and prospects\nof an English technical student. Travels in France,\nNorway and Sweden produced a book of re men is c en ce s,un published as yet. Back in office work, he found that his heart was in hydraulics so he got a Bursary to Guilds, and duly\nobtained his D.I.C. He wrote a report for the technical press on his Spanish water power vac. work in'51, but denies having further ambition in the scientific journalist line. At I.C., he didn't like being a fresher, so he stayed\nout of things until his eye was caught by a FELIX appeal\nfor labour. He joined as a writer, and a prodigious\nvolume of work has since fallen from his pen. His prose\nis\" distinctive and even unpolished\" according to his own description, but he also uses his early draughtsmanship training to good account. Maps and headlines are\noften his work. For light articles he uses the\npseudonym \"Imp\", while his more serious work is characterised by a display of semicolons; a hsb it which the\nnew Editor has caught from him.\nIt was inevitable that he should become Editor; and\nat the beginning of this session it was natural that he\nshould take the job a second time to organise the\nwreckage of the last Board, after the disappearance of\nthe Ed. Elect. He confesses to finding FHLIX Editing frustrating; there is too much managing to be done;\nnot enough writing and too much routine. He is a keen boat-clubman. After2 weeks as cox\n(no previous experience) he was thrown out of the\nGuilds '51 Lowry crew, but this year was in it and won.\nFond of Delius, Mozart, Brahms, Josh. White, and many\nothers,he dislikes reading novels (Waste of time\"), has an unu au ally strong fear of war, is interested in most things, is very sensitive to criticism, hates\nfacetious articles( \"they must be witty or sensible\") and has an abominable taste in puns. Unlike the average\nFelicia n Boss, he doesn't want to write a play (\"there\nare enough already\"). On ' Profiles' he says, with\ncharacteristic sprightliness, \"The subject should see it before it is printed.\" His Boat Club Dinner account in this issue is interesting. He was seen, at that event, to be enjoying hims elf immensely and we view with deep suspicion any suggestion that he has not made the whole thing up. Nevert he less, we have no doubt that it is the most accurate\naccount obtainable, such is our faith in him.\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE DRAMATIC SOCIETY PRESENTS\n' THE JEALOUS WIFE\" A COMEDY\nBY GEORGE COLMAN\nDECEMBER IOth-I3th 7 . 3 0 rm. VAC. WORK COMMITTEE The Autumn Term meeting of the Union Vacation Work\nCommittee was held on the 11th November. It lasted ij- hours, spending most of this time in discussions on\nPublicity, Insurance, standards of firms' training programmes and complaints concerning students going\nabroad. The meeting was attended by its full members hip: Professor Levy, the Chairman, and the eight other\nsenior members of the staff representing the departments;\ntogether with an F.B.I, representative for industry, the two Union Council student members, and the Secretary,\nMr. Newby. First the Annual Report to the college Governing Body and I.C. Union Council, and an abstract\nform of it for press release, were approved, and the\ncommittee then received reports of various details of the International and home working of the scheme last year.\nArising from certain accidents to a few students, from\nvarious countries, abroad last year, the costs and bene-fits of some Insurances were discussed. It was agreed\nto recommend strongly, but not insist on, sickness, industrial and travel insurance to all students going\noverseas. Since the majority of students registering for next year had already replied, to a suggestion made\nto each, that they were interested in such cover, the\ncommittee were happier about making this a stronger proposal, than they were on how to meet one further liability: the need for a fund to assist in the expenses incurred\nfollowing serious or fatal illness of the student abroad.\nSuch would not be covered by the reasonable premiums of the recommended insurance, and would cost much more to cover. A proposal was therefore made that the Union, or\nthe committee, set up a fund for such (very rare) cases,\nlevying a small sum, say 2 / - , from each student going\nabroad, to form the fund. The Union representatives\nagreed to put this idea before the Union.\nThe massive detail of the report - a copy of which\nis in the Library boil down to some interesting numbers:\na total of 488 students went abroad from this country last\nsummer, from 25 colleges and universities, including119 from I.C. In exchange 602 came in, Britain being one of\nthe five countries of the seventeen, that receives more\nstudents than they send out. The year's total multilateral exchanges totalled3493. Nearly 80 reports by I.C. students, of their experiences abroad this year, have now been evaluated, and these\nindicate that \"the results still obtained are of a very\nhigh level.\" BOAT CLUB DINNER This year's Boat Club Dinner was held two days after Morphy Day, and it was perhaps the fact that your reporter thus did not arrive tired from racing and an after noon's beer that resulted in his enjoying it only in parts.\nHowever it was better than last year's all time low in Refectory dinners: the meal was worth what the committee\npaid for it About 100 attended, including some 25 guests. Among\nthose with their private pin of beer - Bar bitter only -were the victorious Guilds Morphy and Lowry crews. The\nCaptain of Thames R.C., RR. Swatton, presented them with their Cups and Pots; and also the winners of the club\nsmall-boat competitions with their cups:\nTi zard Challenge Cup for Senior Sculls R.G. Seaman\nWebber Challenge Cup for Junior Sculls I.M.T it che ner Lindsay Memorial Cup for Novice Sculls A.R. Saunders\nWynne-Finch Cup for Pair OarsJ . P. Gibson & I.M.T it che ner The toast to \"The Club\"was proposed as ui u al by\nCharles Bristow. He referred to the fine race given to\nthe Guilds by the Miie s, and he was greatly cheered in his praise for the stout efforts made by the two R.C.S. crews against the odds. His talk lasted the surprisingly snappy time of 22 minutes. The Captain, P. D.R. Mal tley, took up Charles' outline of the history and\naims of the Club concerning the past and present year.\nHis survey included the loss of the Walton Thames Cup,\nbut the regain of the Sabin Tankard - which ghastly\ntwo gallon( a capacity its sole virtue) trophy was there\non the table. The Vice Captain, Geoff Seaman, then proposed \"x ne Thames Rowing Club\" - the foster parents, taken so much\nfor granted by I.C., who provide bar and tea facilities for us, and who in exchange receive the worn-out\nI.C. oarsmen when they leave college. \"Swatt\" in reply had only four minutes vo ioe left from umpiring\nthe races on Wednesday - and made a speech in it. One\nwould think that the Morphy Day behaviour of I.C.'s supporters had never been noticed. Peter GibBon, the Secretary, then proposed \"The\nGuests\", by short references to each of them. Derek\nCoomber in reply made the popular speech of the evening\nwith formalities properly said and jokes of no content\nwell told. The company then retired for the remaining hour in the bar. But the sing-song was noisy. Perhaps\neveryone felt they had to catch up in the hour an even-ing wasted on talk, and were trying to repeat the good\nlong evening's voice of Wednesday. However, by that time\nyour correspondent and other, more senior, coxswains\npresent were beyond steering the course.\n\n"

The game a tH arlington on November 1 2 th. was not one of the hard, narrowly decided contests which are usual in the Cup competition. I.C. were rarely extended and won\nas comfort ly as the score suggests. The visiting forwards were an ineffectual combination, so that the college almost mono polis ed the ball from the scrum s and line out e, and the strain on the U.C. defence was too great. The first break came when Hy kin cut through diagonally on the left and found Davies up in3 ide him for a scoring pass. Knox converted this try, and later kicked a penalty goal. Further tries were added a regular intervals by Holraan,\nDavies, Robinson and Crossley, and one was converted by Knox. The three quarters can be criticised for too often resorting to a high punta head, and for not trying any\nrolling ground kicks. There were also some bad of dropped passes, which would have been expensive against better opponents; but the determined running of Hearn and Holraan\nwas a. good feature. The forwards appeared disinclined to unnecessary exertion, but cleaner heeling together with n uch more intensive backing up, both in defence and attack, will be needed if we are to retain the Cup.

Hockey First Round \u2014\nTRUMPETERS TRIUMPH. This season has so far shown at ad harvest the probable reason for such a crop is in experience. In previous seasons we have had a large percentage of ex servicemen, the majority of whom had attained considerable' club' experience. However, some of the fresher s are showing great promise. notably Cox, Curtis, and B roe kman; theIst. XI is beginning to settled own and we hope now to enjoy some hard fought and close matches. This season we have four representatives in the University Hockey team and their absence is reflected in the Club's records of ar. Of the twenty one matches played only two have been won and two drawn. However we hope that U.C. is polishing the U.L. Hockey Cup for us as we have a very good chance of winning it when the four University players have added the necessary' zip'. The first round of the Cup was played on November I2t h. against London Hospital Medical School and after a rather scrappy game I.C. won by three goals to one. The next round is against King's and has been brought forward to Wednesday,26 th. November so that both colleges can turnout their strongest teams. The mixed team has again had some amusing games in spite of disapproval shown by those Godson Mount Olympus concerned with the meteorological aspects. Technology Cup' \u2014\nRCS BEAT MINES40. On a cold, wet and windy November afternoon the Mines Motley Mixture strove manfully to try and produce a giant killing act for the second year running but, happily for R.C.S., they were unsuccessful. With only three regular soccer players the Mines, minus their usual fighting spirit, provided poor opposition for a team which is aspiring to win the Cup for the4 th year in succession. The strong wind probably upset the Miners who did not observe the golden rule of keeping the ballon the ground. R.C.S. were also guilty of this fault at times, but when\nit was corrected goals followed naturally. Jackson and Lowe were the scorers, the latter registering a hattrick. Swi mm i ng \u2014\u2014\nThe promising start to the season has been maintained in the matches against N.E.C. and Foster's Transformer Company.\nAgainst N.E.C. the result was i Swimraing, won by I.C.....2414 pts.

Good steering by Mines kept Guilds out of the best water at the bend and at the Crab tree, Mines were some 4 feet in the lead, with an outclassed but very game R.C. S.crew dropping back. The milepost was reached in the goodtime of3 min.17 sec. with the two crews level. Mines forced the turn a little early at the Football ground and Guilds only gained a bare canvas as a result. Mines spurted and drew level and had their bows just in front at the end of the wall. Guilds then began togo ahead and led by\\ length at the Boat House, at which point Mine sheldon until London R.C., where Guilds raised their rate to34 and increased their lead to win by one length. The time was7 m in.53sec.T he race was well fought out by two good fighting crews; Guilds well together but short in the water and Mines somewhat rough, but with plenty of length at the finish of the stroke. Owing to the breakdown of the Umpire's launch, the Lowry was started without it, a clash occurred and the race was restarted. This was unfortunate for the Mines who had made an excellent start and were some f length ahead at the end of half a minute, when the clash took place. The crews were restarted in their relative positions at the time of the clash and Guilds got away well, drew ahead of R.C.S. and up to and beyond the Mines. At the end of the wall Guilds were| length ahead of Mines who were f length upon R.C.S. From here Guilds drew ahead and won by lf l.A fine fight developed for second place, however, with special praise to the R.C.S. This crew, stroked by the cox of the Morphy boat, and Containing five oarsmen and a cox who had never been in a boat before the beginning of term, made a grand attack on the Mines and, well hemmed in by the other two crews, drew up level only too a teh a crab. They recovered quickly and had another go and were only a canvas down at the finish. If that spirit is carried through to I. C.rowing, then there should be many more pots on the high table at next year's Dinner. M0R PH Y CREWS R.C.S.( Mid dx) GUILDS R.S. M.( Surrey) Bow D. Campbell D. Kelly F.R.C.O' Connor E.F. George P.H.

    "content": "FELIX\nl+f UNION\nTh1 apparel may of t proclaim the man, \"but it seems to have little to say about his poetry. Consequently v/e are treated to a comprehensive collection of the standard poets, all bound in1886 vintage ditch water green. I looked at20 of them, and found that only Shakespeare and Milton had ever been taken out. The P aber comic verse book, which is very entertaining, has had a better fate( five times in1951), and T.S. Eliot has a nucleus of fans. Its odd how the intellect u addicts gather round Eliot, even when they are totally ignorant of time conquering giants like Shelley and Pope. Kipling was a colourful writer. His\" Barrack Room Ballads\" is revered by the Regular Army: he must be the most popular poet ever. But bad luck was his lot. He wrote about\" the widow at Windsor\", referring to a certain lady as\" Miss is Victor i er\", and he never became Poet Laureate. Then he died two days after George V,and nobody noticed. Still, Maugham and Eliot have started\" discovering\" him, and no doubt he has a rosy future. A Kipling disciple, Robert Service is represented by a slim volume in our library. Both of them have a wonderful sense of rhythm: they' dont often rise to the level of poetry, but they re worth reading. Theresa book of verse by Professor Andrade, if you re interested in poet scientists, and a slim volume of Henry VIII love letters if you want a few tips. Housman and Rupert Brooke lie undisturbed on our shelves, entombed in that dusty oblivion about which they wrote so charmingly. When your work goes wrong, or when you re cheesed off in the dinner hour, you ought to wander into the library and read an essay. Try Robert Lyndon clergymen and umbrellas, or Harold Nicholson on the discovery of some old stamps. Here is the finest thing in Literature: pure writing, un tinged by any particular aim or prejudice, content to ramble through fantasy, ready to stand and stare. Read Chesterton on Penny Dreadful s, Lamb on Pork, Bello c,Haz litt; the names are legion. Essays are not meant to betaken out. Nobody reads straight through a book of them: you just sav our one when you feel like it: in fact you treat them as respectfully as you would a bottle of whiskey. If you like it neat you might try Bacon, but dont be led into thinking that his cryptic, close strung edifices of remorseless logic are the work of the man we call Shakespeare. Between the heights of Paradise Lost and the doubtful level of\" Merry Gentlemen, a Bacchanalian Scrapbook\", surely there is something for you in this section of our library? DRAM. SOC. STARTS WELL\n\"The Inca of Perusalem\"\nThis one-act play was produced by the I.C. Dram. Soc.\nfor the U.L. One-act play Festival. Shaw wrote the play during the first War as a satire on the Kaiser, who is its main character. The prologue was very effective and unusual, ana the\nArchdeacon'sex it through the auditorium was a surprise to all. In the play itself, Valerie Staoey was perfect as\nthe timid princess and made the best of her few minutes\non the stage. Jean Osborne as Ermyntrude had a lot to say and she did it very well. But she had a lot more to listen to, and here she seemed merely to be waiting for her cue instead of paying attention to the Inca. The\nmain part, that of the Inca himself, was played by Neil Blackmore with assurance. In places he was too much at\nease and spoke more like a retired Colonel than like a dignified Inca who takes himself very seriously. Though\nit is no reflection on his ability, it must be said that he did not suit the part, which needs a much more robust\nperson with a strong, clear voice. The stage was lit brightly and evenly throughout,\nthus handicapping the players to a certain extent.\nShaw's stage directions, always complete, were followed\nfairly closely. Producer Adam Sobey is to be congratulated for this and for the smooth flow of the play as a whole. This is difficult in a play which has only two\nmain characters with others peeping in more or less for comic relief. Difficult too is balancing the flagrantly silly parts against two sober judgments the Inca passes\non the world and its diplomats. This was executed\nparticularly well, and the crowd which was laughing a moment before sat and listened in pin drop silence to the two long speeches.\nIn all, it was a worth jr first effort this year by\nour Dram. Soc., and we o an justly expect great things from\nthem in the future.\nBlurb J^106^ W3\n^1\nJs universally accepted, in this count rv\".I. C. Chemistry lecturer. SOCIAL FRIDAY\\28 TH NOVEMBER.

    "content": "4 FELIX U.L. DEBATES\nOn November14 th Barbara Castle, proposing the Motion\" that the present level of rearmament constitutes a danger to World Peace\", stated that the Motion was of realistic and not pacifist origin and that the moral case for Democracy, was\nbeing neglected for the sake of political expedients. Mr. Russell, opposing, repeated the usual Conservative argument that arms area deterrent to war and that the U.S.S.R. is the only threat to peace at the moment. There were loud cheers from the supporting benches when he quoted Mr. Arthur Deakin. Speeches from the floor ranged from Korea to S. Africa and back to China with a surprising lack of political bias. Even so, one wonders whether the Motion would have been carried by8427 votes if there had not been a Conservative dance that night. I.C. TRIAL DEBATE No more than20 people attended the debate, run on U.L. Debating Cup rules, that\" To be or not to be is not the question,\" Some of the speeches were difficult to follow, other slacked humour, but, generally, the standard was good. Speakers tended not to attach, or build on, others speeches; but this should be corrected when\nthe newer' members gain experience. RECTOR AT CAMBRIDGE Introducing the first of the Rector's series of lector es at Cambridge, entitled\" Some Human\nFactors in Warfare\", the Master of Trinity College said:\" Sir Rod eric Hill is not merely an ex Air Chief Marshal, but a distinguished engineer. Indeed there is no phase of aeronautical science with which he has not been closely associated. Moreover, he is Rector of Imperial College, which is the leading institute in this country for the study of applied science, as well as pure science.\" In his lecture the Rector drew attention to the similarities of warfare by sailing ships and by modern aircraft, and drew examples from the Battle of Trafalgar to illustrate his theme, that a knowledge of human nature counts atleast as much as a knowledge of scientific things. I. C.W. A. COMPLIMENTED\nThe Evening Standard,continuing its spasmodic University series, last week published a picture of eight young ladies, one of whom was Miss E.R. Turnbull, Pre s.I.C. W.A. The correspondent remarked\non the absence of the traditional concept of, a\" blue stocking\" woman student from modern University life. f. Bobby Socks\" were certainly more popular at Putney. \u00a3 et te*& to the CdU m Dear Sir,\nThere was much written in the last \"Felix',\nand much has been lately said in the college,\nabout the lack of I.C,. participation in organised\nrags. The obvious solution to this problem is\nthe institution of an official rag committee. We\nknow that other col leg es possess them and the ne err t' for one in I.C.. is self-evident.\nI be liv ve that I speak for a large number of\nothers, as I know it was definitely intended to\nraise the matter at the last Guilds' Union meeting,\nhad not time intervened. ^\nDisorganised riots have their points, but I am quite certain that organised rags achieve\nbetter results and are usually more entertaining,\nand we may be quite certain that without organisation we shall not reach our proper position,\nconsistently at the head of University act iv it ies.\nIn any case it is time that some of the peace loving officials realised that they cannot prevent\nrags by taking no part in them, and that by taking\na hand themselves, they may well guide the rags\naway from some of the dreadful consequences they\nseem to fear.\nTo organise a rag in a full union meeting would\nbe an awkward procedure, impossible in the time\navailable, and so I propose in open letter that\nI.C. should have a full time, democratically elected rag committee, composed of enterprising, and\nyet fairly responsible, individuals, for, if such\na thing ever existed in I.C.,, it died some years\nback and not even its grave is now in evidence\n{'unless some archaeologist would like to sort\nabout in our history in order to con found me).\nYours Faithfully ,\nD.J. HIGSON\nSi r, It is quite obvious from the general ,feeling\nat the last I.C. Union Meeting etc. that the main\nbody of students within the union are tired of\nbeing repressed annually by successive Presidents on Guy Fawkes day, and are in favour of an I.C.. rag, on a well organised basis.\n, 4 s one of your correspondents suggests, what\nis wanted now is less talk and more action.\nBut unfortunately, we cannot have the one\nwithout the other, so I suggest that, (next year\nbeing Coronation year), a committee is immediately set up to examine the possibility of holding,\nand the organ is at ion of, a charity rag or a carnival through the streets of London, early in the\nNew Year. So that this venture should be fostered from the top, the committee should be elected\nby council from nominations posted on the union\nboard in the usual way. A rag of this type would\nrequire thorough organisation so no time should be\nlost.\nIf leadership had been forthcoming some weeks\nprior to Guy Fawkes day, Harlington would have been\nempty and I,C. would have been in their proper\nplace in the University Rag. As it was, nothing\nf uther was heard, after all the talk of the\nmeeting, and hundreds turned to Harlington for want\nof something better.\nCome on I.C., wake up and let's make 1953 a really 'Imperial' year. D. INMAN.\nDear Sir,\nIn the last issue of 'Felix' we w re told\nthat College new spa ers are to give more prominence to U.L.. activities \u2022 a very laudable intention and yet, in the same issue, there is not one\nother mention of University of London, except on\nthe Sports page,\nI cannot imagine that nothing worth reporting has occurred in the other Colleges during the\npast fortnight, indeed a report on the two previous U.L. Debates was submitted but not pub-li shed, ostensibly due to lack of space, in spite\nof a whole page be ting devoted to sport each week.\nAt a time when the only sol ut ion to the grave\nproblems which beset the world is a resurgence of\ncritical and constructive thought in mankind, it\nseems more than unfortunate that so much prominence is given to those act iv it ies which directly\nprevent this ren a is s ance. Can it be that 'Felix' does not know what its\nreaders require, or does she copy her policy\ndirectly from the commercial press, or is the\nmentality of the students at Imperial College\nreally no higher than that of readers of the\ncheap dailies?\nYours faithfully,\nROGER FISHES ( 2C) Dear Sir,\nThe blood transfusion for student societies\nannounced in the last 'Felix' is likely to prove\nto be of the wrong group, with the usual fatal\nresult. It is not possible for the student societies to be part of the General Studies Scheme\nas it new stands without their losing their identities. If they organise meetings with the help\nof the college authorities in finding speakers\nthey are acting as middlemen instead of primary\npr odu cer s. In a General Studies lecture the conditions are such that the audience is largely\npassive; the shortness of the time, the size of\nthe audience participation which, I suggest,is\na very important feature of student society\nmeetings .\nThis difference in character between the\ntwo types of meeting means that they must be kept\nseparate and some solution, such as starting at\n9.30 every day, must be found to preserve both\nof them.\nYours etc. ,\ni.e. Sir,\nIt is now over half a century since Guilds\nlast purchased a motor-car, (Boanerges 1901), and\nwe feel that it is time a more modern, yet equally\noutstanding mascot is acquired.\nWe therefore regret the bargain recently\nmissed by the Motor Club - a B.R.M. would have\nmade a fitting successor to \"Bo\", having a similar standard of reliability but less seating\ncapacity. A \"Bo' body fitted to a B.R.M. chassis\nwo ul d have overcome this.\nFailing this, we und est and that the Dockers '\nGold Daimler is now on the second-hand car market.\n' Yours faithfully,\n\"WHITE ELEPHANTS'\n\n"

BffiERIAL COLLEGE\nNOVEMBER 2 8 th1952 CO SH SCARE AT PUTNEY As can be seen in our sports reports, a double victory for the3 ui ld3 was not the only cause of celebration on the evening of November12 th. On the same afternoon I.C. Hockey an dRug ger Clubs won their first round ties in University Cups, the latter with the happy score of22 to nil. Throughout the day at Putney the United Hospitals' Regatta was also in progress, providing both excellent and entertaining rowing, and the possibilities of a clash between supporters of the two regattas. As a precaution the undefended Union buildings were locked after lunch until an appreciable force had returned at five o' clock. Earlier in the week, Lord Mayor's Day saw the Guilds assembled in the city. At one time they ur. know ir. gly passed within yards of a lightly escorted\" Reginald\"( property of the St r..d University School). On that Monday Felix' s fragile paper head was taken from the Union office by a Northamptonshire College of Rubber Technology. Since this item is the personal property of the nineteen longhairs that are Felix, we are notable to force this head to an issue. Meeting of the Lord Mayor and the President of the Guilds,' Cheapside,195?, A boat house roof eyewitness, interviewed hy FELIX, tells:\" The crush of marching feet across Putney bridge heralded the arrival of R.C.S.,100 strong, armed with brown bags, and Guilds,150 stalwarts With the Spanner and Bo. First move by Guilds; a barricade of planks across the towpath. The Law arrived in a car to protect the interests of the Public. Two policemen ripped down the barrier and grinned at a delighted crowd, then like all true artists they left the stage at the height of their success after pausing to inflate a tyre which had gone down. There followed THE SPECTACLE. A brick Trail suddenly appeared, h feet high and stretching right across the towpath. A pan technic on, finding the road so unaccountably blocked, stopped. The wheels were immediately chocked, back and front, in order that the vehicle should not be washed away if the river flooded before the road v/ as open again. The driver managed to getaway in reverse after along period of frustration. Meanwhile, frontier patrols were allowing only women and children to pass. Once again, the Lav/ arrived,6 of it, and, of all possible courses, decided to close the road. Then, barehanded, they removed the bricks, while floury dust settled on their car. Another flour bag burst in the air over a bunch of students and officers. In atrice the police whipped out co she s, and brandished them playfully in the faces of a horrified crowd. To relieve this painful situation, and as a form of compensation, a helpful student washed the police car with a bucket of water. He disappeared, followed by the blues. There was no trouble with the Hospitals people. Indeed any misbehaviour was on our side, for we removed the Westminster flag from the Thames boat house. It is understood that it was given back.\" above: accomplices after the fact, below s the scene of the crime. FIRST AGAIN FELIX is informed that As st. Pro f.A.Sten henson has been elected President of U.L. Hockey. FELIX is not surprised. He printed this same information in19^1 and withdrew it later with an apology. 'Ve now withdraw that apology, and remind readers of the old adage \"WHAT FELIX PRINTS TODAY, LOUDON PERFORMS NEXT V EAR\", JACQUES ORCHESTRA\nDEC 4 745 AT O. A.H. "

    "content": "FELIX\nFelix\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE EDITCRjA.R. BRAY CIRCULATION: 1250\nWe are deeply involved in the General Studies lectures; they are a great boon. But a real danger lies in our passive acceptance of this knowledge which is made available to us. Dr. Jacques, who talks every\nweek in an increasingly overcrowded Guilds Council Room\nis alive to the problem.\n\"Don't just play it on the piano,\" he says. \"Play\nit on the oboe, the fiddle, the bassoon, anything,\nsoak yourselves in it.\" This formidable advice contains the essence of the\nmatter. The \" television set\" attitude is far too\nprevalent; it is a sign of decadence. The general\nstudies lectures are not a luxury; they are necessary\nto an intelligent and well balanced outlook.\nR.C.S. seem to have been guilty of Contempt of\nunion. After officially abolishing the Morphy Day\nRag they went down to Putney in the usual style, though\nthe march down Exhibition Road compared un favourably with\nprevious efforts. There is lamentable confusion over the\nwhole question of Rags. Some sensible proposals appear\non the letters page: it now remains for an I.C. Union\nmeeting to do something about it. Very rarely do we receive comments about the articles which appear in FELIX. This week there is a complaint\nabout our University Coverage: we will try to improve\nthis in future. Another correspondent writes about a temporary lapse into \" appalling spacing and composition.\"\nAre tn ere too many or too few humorous features? How\ndo you feel about Music Criticism and Library Reports?\nAre there any startling omissions or unnecessary inclusions in the coming events column? Please give us\nsome idea, in private letters if you dont want pub-li cation, of what you Drefer.\nFAITH,HOP AND CHARITY\nEighteen months ago, the increases in paper and printing costs of FELIX threatened to over tip the balance of payments against sales income, and so the first FELIX Dance was held in May;19^1. Ue feel that such a method of raising the money we need in particular for a typewriter is far preferable to dependence on a subsidy from the Union; and that the alternative method of filling up with outside advertisements is equally undesirable, It has been decided thai; our Third Birthday next week is a suitable time for another dance. We hope that it will be the chaotic affair you expect. The programme will include a film show\nand other diversions. If we are well supported we shall produce a special8 page Christmas and Birthday issue, a t3d. Lighthearted contributions are invited. Dance tickets are2/. GROUNDNUTS FELIX and u ur Printer well overshot themselves in the experiments of the last issue. It was not realised how long the conversion of a FELIX prepared as usual would take: the Printer worked all day end night for three days on it, and even then only four pages were im nerf ect ly done.; fe apologize for our enthusiasm. Some trials haci to be done, and now we hope that FELIX will learn to use the new tools to advantage. Some of the difficulties to be faced are that time to proofread has to be found during the printing period, and illustrations and headlines are at present crude in the new process. Thus, in this^ resent issue, only a small proportion of the paper is done the new way. ITSLIX Christmas Competition\nA printable limerick, beginning:\n\"There was a young lady of Bude\", results to appear in the\nnext issue. No prizes, except Honour, as all the great\nI.C. poets are expected to enter.\nMARXIST LITERATURE STUDY GROUP\nTo date two meetings of this group have been held and subsequent ones will take place on\nThursday lunchtimes at12.50p. m.ina Committee Room.\nThe subjects already discussed have been: the Economic History of the World, Commodity Production, and the essence of Capitalist Exploitation. The literature currently being studied is John Eaton' s\" Political Economy.\" Anyone interested in the subject is welcome to the meet ir^ Viewpoint\nFrom time to time Felix has published letters to the\nEditor, Articles, and even Editorials urging its readers\nto broaden their minds, enliven their intellects and\ncaptivate culture. A recent Viewpoint deplored the possibility that certain clubs and societies should die a natural well merited long overdue death. Everywhere I find an enthusiasm for the expansion of extra-mural activities, and for the encouragement of a liberal education.\nWhat nonsense this is! There is always a bright side, of course. The Authori ties do not want any broad-mindedness. Admittedly there\nis some such aim with our college Authorities, but luckily they do not carry much weight. The Authorities that\nnat ter, those that pay, agree unanimously with me. A college should be, and ours is, merely a posh name for a polytechnic. Both are institutions accepting people\nof a certain standard, instructing them, and turning out\npeople of a higher standard. We are fortunate to belong to a mainly non residential college of a mainly non residential University, because we enjoy comp arat ive immunity from corporate life. We can bury\nourselves in our brown study for three years, without it being possible to bring pressure against us and push us\nout of it. Praise be. You are not here to learn how\nto live, poor misguided misinformed fresher, as you will find out soon. You can learn how to live when you get\nout into the world, and you are earning your own living, for then you will have a much better opportunity, and\nmuch more time. Luckily many Felix readers are with me. All those\nof you who read the reports of games and meetings merely\ndo so because you weren't there, and you don't know\nanyone who was. It is to this intellectual minority\nthat I offer my advice. Gather ye laurels whilst ye\nmay.\nCHE M.ENG.S OC.D INNER In Chem. Tech. the name of Professor W.A. Bone is legend as the last of the old school, with a command of language and directness of expression not now associated with Professors. In1936 his place was taken by Professor A.C. Egerton, and a greater contrast could not have been found. Since1936, and in spite of the war, the fortunes of the Department have been steadily increased, largely through the efforts of Sir Alfred, as he is now known. Now, in his turn, he has returned to give place to the new King of Chem. Tech., Professor D. New it t,an old student of Bo nio. At the annual dinner of the Che m.Eng.S oc., held in Ayrton Hall on the14 th, farewell was\nsaid to Sir Alfred. It was a farewell tempered with pleasure however, as he is remaining a tI.C. as aP.G. and hopes to do some more work himself, now he has handed over the heavy administrative burden. The evening was notable for the excellence of the speeches, both short and long, and surprised many of the past students who were present. Sir Alfred himself gave an address beforehand, consisting largely of fascinating personal reminiscence. Through his description of the personalities of such men as N ernst and Ramsey and the atmosphere surrounding them, one realised the importance of that personal contact with one's Professor which is today all to or are. After the dinner the speeches were many and varied. Indeed so wide was the scope and so high the interest that it was almost possible to forget one's hunger. Chemical Engineers were exhorted to stand on their own feet and stop being almost apologetic about their existence. It was\nsuggested that they had sufficient\" nous\" to be\nable to select their own Culture when and where they liked, but by all means make lectures compulsory, even for registered' brown bag gers'. And in lighter vein an appeal was made that those in' High Office' should spare a thought for the less fortunate, whose only consolation was a waspish landlady. No soft hand to soothe the troubled brows ad indeed their fate! Suggested remedies for the lonely student were elaborated after leaving the table and when\nclosing time, came old friends parted afresh and new friends parted a sold. An evening to be\nremembered.
