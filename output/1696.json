The responses to this\nGraduate Outcomes survey will be crucial in allowing current and future students to make informed choices and in\nhelping us to evaluate and promote our courses.\nThis year\u2019s finalists will be among the first group of students to be contacted in September 2019. To support the survey,\nwe are required to hold accurate contact details for you, including:\n\u2022 A personal email address\n\u2022 At least one telephone number\n\u2022 A postal address (this can be a parental/guardian address)\nWe would be very grateful if you could now review and update the details we currently hold about you via:\nhttp://www.imperial.ac.uk/studenteservice\nWishing you every success in the future\nThe Careers Service\nwww.imperial.ac.uk/careers\nICXCAC \u2013 regicide on the athletics track\nO\nver the past\nmonth, Imperial\nCross Country\nand Athletics\nClub have been fighting\nexam doom and gloom\nwith record-breaking\nachievements. It all began\nat BUCS Outdoors in\nBedford with one of their\nlargest ever teams ready to\nchallenge some of the best\nathletes in the country.\nOver the three-day event,\nImperial athletes raised\ntheir game to compete\nwith the other quality ath-letesondisplay,withmany\nfinals being worthy of a\nnational championship\nfinal. The highlight was\nfresher Daniel Rowden\u2019s\n800m final where he\nstormed to a BUCS gold\nmedal in his first year at\nthe championship \u2013 an\nincredible achievement.\nHe has since run the fifth\nfastest time in the UK this\nyear at the Loughborough\nInternational Fixture.\nAs usual, Chris Olley\nwas in excellent form\nand stormed to a fifth\nplace in a stacked 5,000m\nfield in a time of 14:06.\nNiki Faulkner and Max\nThorp stormed to lifetime\nbest times in the 1500m\nand 400m respectively,\nwhile Kate Olding and\nAlex Mundell made it\nto the semi-finals of the\nwomen\u2019s 800m. Perhaps\nthe most impressive result\nwas that the team placed\ntwelfth out of all univer-sities, despite Imperial\u2019s\nreputation for academia\nover sporting prowess!\nFurther success for the\nsquad came at the recent\nmeet in the London Universities track and field\nseries final in Battersea.\nKing\u2019s College had been\ndominant in the first two\nmatches but Imperial had\nbeen gaining momentum.\nWith a 46-strong team,\nICXCAC managed to fill\nalmost every event and\nwere ready to cause a\nstir. The first track event\nof the day was the 800m\nand with 1st\nand 2nd\nplaces\nin both the men\u2019s and\nwomen\u2019s categories, it\nwas clear from the off that\nthey meant business.\nImperial were neck-and-neck with King\u2019s\nthroughout the day with\ntensions rising and jocular\nbanter flowing between\nthe athletes. Imperial\u2019s\nteam went on to win 13\nevents across the day. The\nlast event of the day was\nthe medley relay which\nconsisted of two legs (one\nmale and one female)\nacross each of the following three distances: 200m,\n400m and 800m. With so\nmuch to play for, the team\nknew the pressure was on.\nUltimately it came down\nto the last few metres\nbut fresher James Millett\nkept his cool and crossed\nthe line in first ahead the\nKing\u2019s athlete who has\nhis fair share of GB vests.\nThis not only ensured\nthat Imperial would bring\nhome the freshly minted\nmedley relay trophy but\nalso won them the match\nby a margin of just three\npoints! This slim victory\nreally highlights the importance of every single\nImperial athlete from the\ntotal beginners to those\nchampions that medalled\nin multiple events. This\nwas Imperial\u2019s most\nsuccessful result since the\nLUCA Outdoors championships began!\nHowever, the most\nimportant race of the day\nmust not be forgotten. The\nmascot race is a hugely\nvalued tradition where\nultimate, beautiful glory\nor pure, humiliation and\nshame is at stake. Victoria\nthe Lion (Albert had other\nbusiness to attend with\nsome rowers) achieved a\nsolid 3rd\nto finish on the\npodium, cementing Imperial\u2019s position as a big deal\non the athletics scene.\nWith the end of the\nuniversity track season\nending the club wishes to\nthank Athletics Captain\nMax Thorp for his commitment throughout the\nyear that has brought\nImperial their most\nsuccessful track and\nfield season in memory.\nSpecial thanks also go\nto former captain Matt\nDouthwaite for organising\nthe London University\nAthletics Series, and to all\nthe volunteers who helped\nensure the season was a\ngreat success.\nSPORTS\nMax Thorp\nAthletics Captain\nICXCAC glammed up and all smiles // ICXCAC\n\n"

And\nneeding that permission\nto do it is frustrating.\nIt\u2019s about giving people\nthe confidence to do\nsomething creative. It\nbenefits us just as much as\nsports, to keep our minds\nand bodies healthy, it\u2019s\nthe same with arts, with\nmusic, with writing, with\ntheatre.\nF: Do you think having something like the\nBlyth Centre as a whole\nthat is semi-institution-al makes it easier for\nstudents to get that\npermission?\nM: Yes. It\u2019s very\nimmediate and very\naccessible. Especially in\nterms of seeing exhibitions in London. There are\nhundreds of exhibitions,\nand they\u2019re all in quirky\nplaces, like \u2018knock three\ntimes on this unmarked\ndoor.\u2019 You think: \u2018is it\ngoing to be good? Will\nit be bad? Can I go there\non my own? Will I knock\non the door?\u2019 \u2013 you can\ncome to the Centre and\nsee a strong cross section\nof what\u2019s going on in the\nart world.\nor three hours \u2013 whatever\nyou want to do \u2013 and not\nfeel you can\u2019t. You\u2019re in a\nsafe, creative space.\nF: Within your own\nwork, you incorporate a\nlot of elements relating\nto the body \u2013 prescription sheets, eyes, teeth.\nHow do art and science\ncome together in your\npractice?\nM: When I was doing\nGCSE science, we had to\ntake something in to look\nat under the microscope.\nMy dad worked in the\nhospital, and he brought\nme cross-slices of tissues,\nsaying \u2018you can take\nthose and they\u2019ll be really\ninteresting to see\u2019. So\nthere\u2019s always been this\nmedical understanding of\nthe body, and this emotional side of the inside\nof the body have been\nmashed together for me.\nAn analytical response to\nan internal body is very\ngood counterpoint to an\nemotional response to an\ninternal state, so they play\ntogether and bounce off\neach other really nicely. I\nenjoy having something\nthat has to be true and\nsomething that\u2019s very\nintuitively felt coming\ntogether.\nF: Recently you\u2019ve also\nbeen making artwork\nin collaboration with\nyour son \u2013 can you talk\na little bit about how\nhaving a child, and involving him in your\nwork, have influenced\nyour practice?\nM: Before I had him,\nI had two strategies to\nmaking: a loving rendering that\u2019s very careful\nto get things in a certain\nway; and then a much\nmore emotionally expressive way to work. I would\nlet those two things smash\ntogether. Looking at my\nson\u2019s gestures, he has a\ntruly accidental gesture\nbecause he had no control\nover the marks he was\nmaking. My emulated free\ngestures can\u2019t compete\nwith his. So I thought if I\nsplit my practice, and give\nhim more of that freedom,\nand take on more of the\nparental roles within the\nart practice then we can\ncommunicate visually\nacross our different modes\nof making.\nThat explains a lot\nmore about my reactive,\nadaptive, response to\nbeing a mum, being a\nperson, and being an artist\n\u2013 my experience of life\ncarries through into my\nwork.\nF: Do you think your\ntime at Imperial, being\nat this intersection between art and science,\nhas influenced your\npractice over the years?\nM: Absolutely. Definitely subconsciously,\nbut then there are certain\nshows that really excite\nme. Getting to see all this\nwork come together, and\nthen coordinate and curate\nit. It\u2019s an art form in itself,\nbringing things together\nlike a conductor so I can\nunderstand the story of\nhow work comes together\nand let the viewer see that\nas well. It\u2019s a very natural\nspace for me to be in, this\ninbetween, so I\u2019m very\nlucky.\nF: You mentioned the\ncurational side of it.\nCan you talk about how\nyou curate a show and\nset up the work?\nM: When things are\ncoming together and\nbeing curated, what I\nimagine are the works are\nlike characters in a story.\nMy job is to introduce the\nstory, and then let the characters interact in a way\nthat makes for an exciting\nnovel, so to speak. So\nthat\u2019s the first part of the\njob, understanding the\nwork and how it relates\nto other work, which is\nrelative and will change.\nThen there\u2019s how the\nworks behave in the\nspace. For me, it\u2019s very\nanthropomorphic, they\nare very living things, so\nthere are questions like:\nhow much space do they\nneed? How much space\nbetween work is needed,\nso they\u2019ve got their own\ntime to breathe and be\nprocessed? It sounds like\nI think about these things\nconsciously, but over the\nyears it\u2019s become very instinctive \u2013 like learning to\ndrive, it seems mad when\nyou first hear it, but then\nit\u2019s very instinctive.\nF: I know you\u2019ve been\nhere for a lot of shows\n\u2013 were there any that\nparticularly stood out\nfor you?\nM: One of my proudest\nshows was between\nPhotography Society\nand Leonardo Fine Art\nSociety. They\u2019d been\ndoing this hybrid show\nfor a few years, but there\nwas just one year where\nthat really clicked. They\nstopped being Photography Society on one side\nand LeoSoc on the other;\nwe did a show where we\nfolded photographs into\norigami birds, and they\nflew like a flock through\nthe space. It was beautiful\nand really ambitious. It\ntook a week to install. You\ncould not tell that wasn\u2019t\na professional show \u2013 and\nfrom that point they\u2019ve\ninteracted really well\ntogether.\nMindy Lee & J.A.L-B, Knocking Knees, 2017, acrylic and thread on cotton bandage cord and wood // Courtesy of the\nartist/Photo: Nick Mansa\nIt\u2019s the same with\nmaking, that fear of the\nblank page \u2013 writer\u2019s\nblock, artist\u2019s block.\nBeing able to come on a\nWednesday afternoon and\nsay \u2018I don\u2019t know what to\ndo\u2019 with other people in a\nsimilar situation, and be\nable to make something\nfor ten minutes, or an hour,\nClash of Cultures \u2013 Mindy Lee\nMindy Lee is an artist and curator of the Blyth Gallery\n\u2013 the creative hub of Imperial, showcasing various\nworks from Imperial students and professional artists\nthroughout the year. In a continuation of the Clash of\nCulture series, Fred Fyles, Editor-in-Chief, talks to Mindy\nabout her work at the gallery and the division between\nscience and art.\nARTS\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\n\u201cWorking in\nthe studio and\nworking in the\nlab is exactly\nthe same\u201d\nW\nhen I listen\nback to the\nrecording\nof my\nconversation with Mindy\nLee, artist and curator of\nImperial\u2019s Blyth Gallery,\nthere\u2019s the faint sound\nof piano music tinkling\nalong in the background.\nMindy\u2019s office is located\nin the Blyth Centre, surrounded by music practice\nrooms, from which the\nsound of students hammering at piano keys\nemanate; it has a beautiful\nview over the grass of\nQueen\u2019s Lawn, where\nstudents have spilled out\nto enjoy the warm midday\nsunshine. The Blyth\nCentre, is, in a number of\nways, the artistic hub of\nImperial College London;\nit\u2019s home not only to these\npractice rooms, but also to\nthe Blyth Gallery, a long\nwhite-walled space, where\nImperial students and staff\nregularly display their\nwork. Mindy is its curator,\ndividing her time between\norganizing shows, putting\non art workshops for staff\nand students, and making\nher own artistic work.\nWe caught up with her to\nchat about the intersection\nbetween art and science,\nas well as the influence\nscience has had on her\nown work.\nFred: Could you tell me\na little bit about your\nbackground, and how\nyou got involved with\nthe Blyth Gallery?\nMindy: I\u2019ve always\nwanted to be an artist, and\nI was born into a family\nof scientists, so I\u2019ve been\nbrought up with a scientific way of processing the\nworld around me. I was at\nthe Royal College of Art\nfrom 2002 to 2004, during\nwhich time there was a\ncommission to celebrate\nwomen in science, which\nI won. So I worked with\nImperial for a year to\ndevelop a painting, and\nfrom that I got to know\nRichard Dickins, Director\nof the Centre. We had a\nlot of conversations about\nhow the Gallery could\nstay open, because it was\nunder threat of closure.\nThat led to me coming\nhere as an independent\nadvisor for a couple of\nyears, before eventually\ngetting a permanent\nposition.\nmake art, and be taught\nfor free by myself and\nother artists throughout\nthe year.\nF: What do you think\nabout the societal division between art and\nscience? Do you think\nsuch a division does really exist? How do the\ntwo interact?\nM: I think the divide is\nimagined, or it\u2019s to do with\nnot being able to translate\nfrom one language to\nanother. I think interaction\nand influence between\nthe two happens in three\nways: there\u2019s a direct\ninteraction, which could\nbe a collaboration on\nprojects. The second way\nthey influence each other\nis an indirect way, which\nis a cross-pollination of\nideas or conversations\narising between subjects\nand disciplines; it\u2019s not\na direct interaction, but\nthere\u2019s something about\ntalking around subjects\nor research through\nexhibitions and workshops which triggers a\ndevelopment. The third\nway, which is equally\nimportant, is a separated\ninteraction, where the art\nand the science are apart\n\u2013 particularly at Imperial,\nthe scientists are taking a\nbreak from thinking about\ntheir analytical research.\nThey can concentrate on\nusing a different part of the\nbrain, and thinking with\ndifferent logic systems\nand scenarios. Then when\nthey come back from\nthis altered, other way of\nspending time, they return\nrefreshed, and might just\nhave a breakthrough,\nbecause they\u2019re coming at\nthe research from a completely different angle. I\ntry and provide opportunity for all three scenarios\nwith the programme here,\nso there\u2019s maximum\nopportunity for people to\ninfluence each other.\nTalking to one of the\nPhD students, we came\nto the conclusion that\nworking in the studio\nand working in the lab\nis exactly the same. It\u2019s\nabout looking at a set of\ninformation and rules, and\nhow you explore those\nlogic systems within your\nown practice, whether\nthat\u2019s an experiment\nor a painting. It\u2019s like\ntranslating: the translation\nisn\u2019t word for word, but\nit\u2019s about the flow of the\nlanguage and the nuances\nof the language you\u2019re\nspeaking \u2013 it\u2019s the same\nwith visual and scientific\nprocesses. If you\u2019ve got a\nrigorous discipline in one\nbut it\u2019s light in the other,\nthen it doesn\u2019t translate as\nwell as it should. Whereas\nif you\u2019ve got a respect\nfor each language and an\nunderstanding of each\nlanguage, then you lose\nthe barrier, you can flow\nbetween the two really\neasily.\nMindy installing the work of Alexander Yip in the Blyth Gallery// Alexander Yip\n\u201cThe division\nbetween\nscience and art\nis imagined;\nit\u2019s to do with\nnot being able\nto translate\nfrom one\nlanguage to\nanother\u201d\nF: Could you tell us a bit\nabout the Blyth Gallery\nitself?\nM: The Blyth Gallery is\non Level 5 of the Sherfield\nBuilding, and we have\ntwelve shows a year.Three\nare professional shows\nby visiting and emerging\nartists, who could be London-based, or national,\nor international. There is\none Royal College of Art\nshow, and eight shows\nthat are Imperial College\nstudent and staff: art soci-eties, medical humanities\nstudents, PhD researchers,\nsolo staff members, artist\nin residence \u2013 you\u2019ve got\na really nice mix of things\nto see in the space.\nI also run a studio space,\nwhich is in 153 Roderic\nHill, where students and\nstaff can come to learn\nF: You also run painting\nand drawing classes\nwithin the studio. One\nthingI\u2019vefoundencouraging students to write\nis a sense that people\ndon\u2019t feel they\u2019re \u2018allowed\u2019 to be creative\nbecause they\u2019re a sci-entist. I was wondering\nwhether that\u2019s something you\u2019ve found?\nM: Yes, there\u2019s a barrier\nthere in terms of self-per-mission, absolutely. I\u2019m\nmentoring with PhD\nstudents over the summer,\nand a lot of students have\nsaid \u2018I needed an excuse\nto allow myself to make\nsome art, and this project\nhas given me that excuse.\u2019\nNot allowing ourselves\n\n"

Joanne Segars OBE,\nchair of LGPS Central,\nwhich pools nine local authority pension funds, will\nchair the JEP. It is due to\nreport in September 2018.\nA spokesperson for\nUCU told Felix: \u201cThe\nwork of the JEP will\nbe closely watched by\nmembers of UCU and it is\nhoped that a satisfactory\nagreement can be reached\nto avert the necessity of\nUCU taking further strike\naction over our pensions.\u201d\nsurplus to buildings rather\nthan to staff.\u201d\nA spokesperson for\nthe College told Felix the\ndiscussions have \u201ctaken\ninto account feedback\nfrom staff raised as part\nof the Pay and Benefits\nReview.\u201d\n\u201cA number of follow\nup actions from the Pay\nand Benefits Review are\nalready underway.

Information about\nthe offer should be available shortly afterwards.\nTuition Fee Refunds\nThe debate over\ntuition fee refunds is still\nongoing. A petition that\ncirculated at the end of\nlast term saw over 3,000\nstudents asking for a\nrefund in tuition fees in\nlight of missed teaching.\nThe petition was sent\nto senior management,\nbut some students felt the\nresponse was insufficient.\nAlex Chippy Compton,\nPresident of Imperial\nCollege Union, and Luke\nMcCrone, President of\nthe Graduate Students\u2019\nUnion, at the time said\nthe response from senior\nmanagement was \u201cunsatisfactory, and failed to\naddress many students\u2019\nconcerns\u201d.\nA class action bid,\nlaunched by law firm\nAsserson, has seen a\nnumber of students join to\nforce universities to compensate them for teaching\ntime lost. Asserson estimates fair compensation\nfor teaching time lost\nwould be several hundred\npounds per student. The\ncase has attracted over\n5,000 students, from a\nrange of universities.\nsaying: \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard\nof a single university\noffering to pay anybody\ncompensation for the lost\nteaching time.\u201d\nHe went on to say:\n\u201cUniversities simply\nwill not pay until they\u2019re\nforced to pay, and the only\neffective way to force\nthem to pay is to take\nthem to court. To do so\nindividually doesn\u2019t make\nsense, because it\u2019s too\nmuch risk and work for\none person, but to do it as\na group is doable.\u201d\nA College representative told Felix it\n\u201ccurrently has no plans to\nrefund students\u201d, saying:\n\u201cFees cover all aspects\nof a student\u2019s time at\nImperial, and are based\non the delivery of overall\noutcomes, rather than\nbeing payments for specific contact hours.\u201d This\nargument was echoed\nby several other Russell\nGroup universities, which\nsaid they had no plans to\noffer refunds to students.\nMr Goldwater told\nFelix that, while tuition\nfees do go toward several\nservices, \u201cthe question is\nworking out percentages.\nI don\u2019t think anyone\nwould say the percentage\nof fees that go on teaching\ntime is zero\u2026if you look\nat the budgets universities\nhave, salaries of teaching\nstaff are often the single\nbiggest item by a long\nway. It\u2019s not unreasonable\nto suggest that more than\n50% of the tuition fee\nrelates to face-to-face\nteaching.\u201d\nEarlier this week,\nresults of the 2018 Student\nAcademic Experience\nSurvey were released,\nhighlighting a desire from\nstudents for better value\nfor money in their degree\ncourses. Fewer than 40%\nof students thought they\nwere getting value for\nmoney from their univer-sity, with tuition fees and\nteaching quality leading\ncauses of dissatisfaction.\nStudents also highlighted\na desire for more contact\nhours, possibly a result of\nhigh fees students currently pay.\nStaff taking part in the strike earlier this year // Joseph O'Connell-Danes\n\u201cImperial\nwithheld\njust under\n\u00a3280,000 from\nstaff in March\nand April\u201d\nThe first meeting of the\nJEP took place at the end\nof last month.

This\nweek marks the\npenultimate editorial \u2013 this time next week,\nyou\u2019ll be reading the last\npaper of this academic\nyear, which will also be\nthe last time you\u2019ve got\nto listen to my weird\nstream-of-consciousness\nramblings.\nBut in some ways, this\nweek is the last \u2018real\u2019 ed-itorial, since I know next\nweek it\u2019s just going to\nbe me gushing over how\namazing all our contributors have been over the\npast year. This means this\nweek is the last chance I\nhave to speak my mind,\nand do one last bit of\ntubthumping before I go.\nSoI\u2019vedecidedtoreturn\nto the topic of the strikes.\nRemember those? Back\nwhen the weather was\nexceptionally bitter, and\nmany of us walked past\nour friends and colleagues\npicketing out in the snow\nto get (a) to class, (b) a\ncopy of Felix, or (c) an\nSCR muffin (choose your\npoison). If you remember,\nthe academic and support\nstaff were taking action\nabout changes to their\npensions, which would\nhave made them worse off\nin the long-run; they were\njoined by students, who\n\u2013 although not directly\naffected \u2013 were aware of\nthe impact this could have\non their future studies or\ncareers.\nWhile the strike might\nbe over \u2013 for the time\nbeing \u2013 the effects are still\nbeing felt. And one place\nthey are being particularly\nfelt is in the pay packets\nof the staff who joined the\nstrike. Universities across\nthe UK withheld pay for\neach day their staff went\non strike, and docked\npay for days where staff\nrefused to cover classes\nor reschedule teaching.\nThis is money that is still\nbeing withheld by the\nuniversities, with monthly\nincomes being reduced\nfor staff.\nA Felix investigation\nfound already Russell\nGroup universities had\nwithheld \u00a38 million from\nstaff, with further deductions planned pushing it\npast the \u00a310 million mark.\nWe don\u2019t know how much\nis being withheld across\nthe UK, but based on\nthe data we got from the\nRussell Group, it is highly\nlikely to be in the tens\nof millions, potentially\napproaching the \u00a3100\nmillion mark. This highlights the very real risk\nour staff took to join in\nthe strike \u2013 particularly in\na city like London, where\nthe rise in cost of living\nhas outpaced increases in\nImperial salaries.\nOne use of the money,\nwhich none of the universities we contacted\nmentioned, was giving\nit back to students, who\nhave paid for their university education, and had\nbeen missing out (in some\ncases quite significantly).\nAs far as I am aware, no\nuniversity in the UK has\nconsidered paying back\ntuition fees to students;\nand they\u2019re not going to,\nunless the current legal\nbattles that are ongoing\nsucceed. The response\nfrom senior management\nat Imperial \u2013 that we pay\nfor \u2018an overall outcome\u2019\nand nothing else \u2013 is\nshort-sighted, offensive,\nand damaging to the very\nidea of the university as\nan institution. We don\u2019t\ncome here to just get a 2:1\nand fuck off. Or, at least,\nwe shouldn\u2019t. We come\nhere to have a true university experience. To meet\nfriends who we will keep\nin touch with for the rest\nof our lives. To learn from\ninspiring mentors. To\nforge links.

It focuses\non moving with the body\ninstead of contorting it\nand has a lot of surprising\nhealth benefits. Aside\nfrom the stress reduction\nand relaxation a good\nsession of exercise can\nbring, belly dance also\nimproves your posture by\nstrengthen muscles in the\nback and relieving tension\nin the lower back. While\ndancing, your leg muscles\nare constantly in use to\nstabilise you and give\nthe impression of gliding\nmovement which means\nthe impact on your joints\nis minimal.\nMoves from this dance\nstyle have quickly been\npicked up and used in\nfitness classes, as they\nwork out many areas\nat once while feeling\nlike you\u2019re just dancing\naround!

This is a folkloric\ndance from the rural area\ncalled Sa\u2019id located in\nSouthern (Upper Egypt)\nand is performed by men\nand women at festive\nevents, such as weddings.\nDuring the workshop we\nwill cover many basic\nsteps, foot patterns as well\nas technique covered in a\ncombination (canes will\nbe provided).\nSaidi dancing originates from a kind of\nconflict with sticks\nbetween men to show\ntheir power. It is the oldest\nform of Egyptian martial\narts to have survive and is\nfrom the pharaonic times.\nThe Pharaohs painted this\nkind of dance on the walls\nof their temples and their\nsoldiers learned it. At the\ntime it was considered\nto be a form of weapon\ntraining. Over time it has\nevolved into purely dance\nand incorporated with\nother styles of belly dance\nto give the Saidi we know\ntoday. This workshop will\nbe taught by Sureya Bellydance, a professional\nbelly dance performer,\ninstructor and choreographer based in London.\nHer passion for belly\ndance comes from her\nTurkish background.

However they can\nsometimes do a bit more\nthan that. Depending on\nthe game and at which\npoint you\u2019re in, games can\nteach us important things\nabout society and empa-thy. Heck, they could even\nbe considered character\nbuilding in a sense.\nConsider a small child,\na child who has yet to\nexperience the misfortune of loss in their life.\nThey\u2019re playing a game\nlike Final Fantasy for\nexample. And they reach\na point where one of the\ncharacters dies and cannot\ncome back for the rest of\nthe game. The child may\ntry all sorts of tricks to\nreverse this outcome, but\nat the end of the day, they\nhave to realise they must\nmove on and look to the\n\u201cThey can\nhighlight\nthings like the\nharsh realities\nof war\u201d\n\u201cGames can\nspeculate over\ndevelopments\nthat are yet\nto come and\nshape the\nfuture\u201d\nIn a more contemporary and mature example,\nlet\u2019s have a look at the\ngame This War of Mine.\nIn this game, you control\ndifferent civilians during\na war. The characters\nhave no experience with\nfighting or combat, their\nonly goal is to survive.\nAt one point in the\ngame, you\u2019re gathering\nsupplies and pondering\nyour next move when you\nhear a conversation next\ndoor, although saying\n\u201cconversation\u201d would be\nbeing polite. A soldier is\nbeing aggressive with a\nwoman and threatening\nto rape her. The character\nyou\u2019re controlling is only\narmed with a shovel; the\ncharacter also has three\npeople who are dependent\non him. If you\u2019re able to\nleave safely, then those\npeople will be able to\nsurvive for longer. What\ndo you do? It\u2019s an intense\nand gruelling decision\nand this game is just full\nof these complex choices.\nWhile playing a game\nlike this can emotionally\nwreck you, they can\nhighlight things like the\nharsh realities of war and\nthe plight of those unfortunate individuals who\nare trapped in difficult\ncircumstances where they\ncan\u2019t see an easy way out.\nGames can not just help\nus emphasize with particular situations but also\nmake us ask questions\nabout society. Science\nfiction, in particular, is\nan interesting concept to\nplay around with in media\nbecause of the way technology is becoming more\nprominent in our daily\nlives. Compared to other\nforms of media, you\u2019re\nable to play a persona by\nyourself in a video game.\nYou step into the shoes of\na multitude of characters\n(literally if you\u2019re playing\na VR game) and you get\nto experience how you\u2019re\ntreated, what impacts\nyour choices have, and\nmuch more. It can get you\nthinking on what kind of\nperson you are and how\ndifferent things can affect\nyour lives.\nDetroit: Become\nHuman attacks the current\nstatus quo and makes\ngamers recognise the\nfaults within society, and\neven within themselves.\nIt has only been out for a\nfew weeks but it\u2019s already\nbeen gaining a massive\nfollowing. I\u2019ll try not to\ngo into too many spoilery\ndetails but, essentially, the\ngame makes a statement\non what technology does\nto us and what it means\nto be human. It features\na society that has become\nso dependent on societal\napproval that CEOs\nare regarded more as\ncelebrities than business\nowners, where a single\nstep out of turn can break\nup the company. It\u2019s a\nbit of an extension of\ncurrent society, where\nthere\u2019s a focus on a form\nof hedonism as opposed\nto personal growth or\nsustainability. What\u2019s the\npoint of taking pictures of\nfood? Just to show off and\nhave others look at our\nachievements, right?\nGames can speculate\nover developments that\nare yet to come and shape\nthe future; they make us\nintrospect about hard, real\nlife questions. By having\nthe events of a game in\nan alternate world or a\nnear-distant future, we can\ndraw parallels with our\nworld. Deus Ex: Human\nRevolution in particular\ndeals with transhumanism\nand the disparity of wealth\nin society. The main character is someone who goes\nbeyond what it means to\nbe a regular human with\naugmentations and body\nupgrades. Throughout\nthe game, we also get\nglimpses of the under-classes who are left behind\nand complaining simply\nbecause they cannot\nafford augmentation. We\nsee how this disparity\naffects society, the good\nand the ugly, with the rich\nrising to the top ranks.\nHuman Revolution puts\nus smack in the middle of\nthe situation and makes us\nexamine the effects of this\nparticular technology first\nhand.\nUltimately games are\nmore than just a storytelling device and an\nentertainment medium.\nThe fun and awesome\ngameplay can be juxtaposed with societal themes\nand character questions.\nThey provide a canvas to\nexplore questions about\nour world and teach us\nmore about different situations people experience.\nSure, there will be people\nwho won\u2019t be able to\ntake home the important\nmessage, but it will reach\na lot of people \u2013 including\nyou, if you remember to\nlook for it.\nNothing more needs to be said // 11 bit studios\nSaad Ahmed\nGames Editor\nGAMES\nWhat does it mean to be human? // Sony Interactive Entertainment\nfuture.

Now\nI\u2019m not saying that losing\na virtual character is the\nsame as losing a loved\none in real life, but at least\nthere can be a small degree\nof understanding from the\nvideo game, which can\nultimately be the first step\nin empathy.\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1696\nFELIX\n13\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCan there be art after warfare?\nA\nftermath, the\ntitle of the\nTate Britain\u2019s\nnew exhibi-tion, which looks at art\nproduced in Europe after\nWorld War One, was originally an agricultural term.\nIt described the growth of\ngrass and other plants that\nfollowed a harvest \u2013 the\nsweeping away of the old\ncreating a space in which\nthe new could develop and\nblossom. It\u2019s an appropriate choice: the outpouring\nof violence and horror\nthat occurred within WWI\npaved the way for a completely different society,\none explored by artists\nin a heady combination\nof jingoism, misery, and\npowerful imagery.\nThe exhibition begins\nwith the War still ongoing,\nfeaturing artists from\nFrance, Germany, and the\nUK who had gone abroad\nto document the destruc-tion. While this generation\nof artist-soldiers may have\nbeen fighting for different\nsides, with radically different outlooks, they all\nrecognised the horrific\nwaste of war, with the\nabandoned helmet coming\nto represent loss across all\nthree countries.\nIf the First World\nWar had an official form\nof painting, it could be\ncalled the \u2018anti-landscape\u2019 \u2013 a reflection of\nthe way shells and mines\nchurned up the beautiful\nFrench countryside,\nleaving it pockmarked\nand hollow. Charles\nSims\u2019 vast landscape of\ntrenches stretches along\none wall of the gallery;\nits tumultuous topography\nlooks like a vast wave of\nsea foam, with corrugated\niron and crosses sticking\nout like the carapaces of\ncrustaceans. It contrasts\nbeautifully with William\nOrpen\u2019s delicate oil\npainting of the trenches,\nwhich is almost bucolic\nin its radiance. Elsewhere,\nPaul Nash\u2019s \u2018Wire\u2019\nfeatures a mutilated tree,\nsurrounded by whorls of\nbarbed wire that appear\nlike horrific gashes on the\ncanvas.\nThe room is watched\nover by a pair of incredible sculptures: Jacob\nEpstein\u2019s vulnerable\n\u2018Rock Drill\u2019, truncated\nand de-limbed, becoming\na figure of pitiful vul-nerability; and Wilhelm\nLehmbruck\u2019s \u2018Fallen\nMan\u2019, whose elongated\nlimbs convey the horrific\nanguish of warfare. Lehmbruck, who committed\nsuicide in 1919 following\nmilitary service as a para-medic, was clearly keenly\nattuned to the dehuman-ising effects of warfare,\nand this work crackles\nwith an energy akin to\nK\u00e4the Kollwitz\u2019s \u2018Mother\nwith her Dead Son\u2019. Both\nworks connect beautifully\nwith George Grosz and\nJohn Heartfield\u2019s dadaist\nwork, \u2018The Middle-Class\nPhilistine Heartfield Gone\nWild\u2019, whose mutilated\nmannequin highlights the\ntreatment of veterans in\npost-war Europe.\nThe interaction\nbetween artists and\ngovernments is also\ninterestingly explored:\nCharles Sargeant Jagger\u2019s\nsculptures commemorating those who died in the\nRoyal Artillery and Great\nWestern Railway contain\na tension that spills out\nin his great tableau of a\nscene of a sentry in No\nMan\u2019s Land, which is\nhorrific in its violence. A\nnearby Hindenburg Cross,\nawarded by the Nazis as\npart of their mission to\nreconfigure the memories\nof WWI, shows how art\nand sculpture can be used\nfor propaganda purposes,\nwhich is reinforced by\nAndre Mar\u00e9\u2019s vulgar\nmonument to the French\nwar dead.\nAs well as scars on the\nland, WWI left its impact\non the terrain of both the\nbody and the psyche.\nEnglish works depicting\nfacial wounds obtained\nby soldiers, produced\nfor medical purposes,\ncontrast with Grosz\u2019 and\nOtto Dix\u2019s brilliantly-un-settling caricatures of\ncrippled soldiers, which\nare pure nightmare fuel,\nand contain a powerful\npolitical message. Conrad\nFelixmuller\u2019s lithographs\nof soldiers in psychiatric\nhospitals bristle with\nan unsettling energy,\nreminiscent of something\nout of The Cabinet of Dr\nCaligari.\nThese dark visions are\nrevisited in the centerpiece of the exhibition: a\ndarkened room containing\nworks from print series by\nOtto Dix, Max Backman,\nKathe Kollwitz, and\nGeorges Rouault. The\nprints, which are all from\nseries the artists produced,\nare incredibly poignant,\ntaking us through the\nfull gamut of war, from\nviolence to horror to grief.\nKollwitz\u2019s prints retain\ntheir numbing, tumultuous power, centring on the\nwomen and children who\nwere left behind.\nAfter this point,\nhowever, the exhibition\nstarts to lose its narrative\nthread. The curators make\nthe decision to focus\non artists exploring the\nimpact the war had on\nsociety at large. The issue\nwith this is that the war\nwas so large \u2013 there is a\nreason it was called the\nGreat War \u2013 that any art\nproduced post-WWI could\nbe said to have an impact\non artists. Yes, the works\nby Winifred Knights and\nMeredith Frampton are\nbeautiful, as are the classical studies by Picasso and\nDerain, but how are they\nreally related to the First\nWorld War, other than by\nvirtue of being produced\npost-1918?\nAs the final section\nmoves towards the\nBauhaus, the decision\nto only include artists\nfrom the UK, France, and\nGermany comes to seem\nstrange \u2013 these weren\u2019t the\nonly countries affected by\nthe war, and by bringing\nin art by Oscar Schlemmer and others the choice\nto exclude Russian artists,\nwho were hugely influential throughout Europe,\nbecomes a striking\nomission.\nBy turns heart-rending\nand frustrating, Aftermath\nis worth going to for the\nprints section alone. The\npower of works by the\nGerman artists isn\u2019t quite\nenough to sustain the\nexhibition through the\nlatter half \u2013 where the\ntight curation begins to\nunravel \u2013 but Aftermath\nshows us how beauty can\nbe obtained even through\ntragedy.\nThe Tate Britain\u2019s new show does a good job looking at how WWI impacted artists, but falls apart at the end.\nPaul Nash (1889 \u20131946), Wire, 1918-9.

However,\namidst this data frenzy\naround our web footprint,\na new conversation\naround a different kind\nof data is taking place:\nhealthcare data! Big data,\nAI, and analytics have\nmade a buzz in all business sectors today. Their\nrising importance has\nalso captivated leaders in\nmedical technology.\nMedical science was\nonce the science of ob-servation. Today, it is the\nscience of data. More and\nmore healthcare facilities\nare focused on collecting\nlargesetsofdatafromtheir\npatients using a myriad of\nmeasurements, including\ngenetic sequencing, whole\nbody imaging, and metab-olomics, to name a few.\nThis makes it possible to\nunderstand a patient\u2019s test\nresults in the context of\nthe whole body, as well\nas observe and understand\nits progression over time,\nleading led improvements\nin both prognosis and diagnosis of many diseases.\nThe idea of systems\nmedicine (personalised\nmedicine) dates back to\nthe days of the human\ngenome project in the\nearly \u201890s, where it was\nwell understood that many\ndiseases have a genetic\nbasis. If we could read the\nentire genome of a person,\nthen we can identify the\ngenetic peculiarities in\nthem, and understand the\ncauses of the disease.\nToday, it is well\naccepted that genome\nalone is not the complete\nrepository of everything\nwhich happens in the\nbody. There has been\nrapid improvements in\ntechnologies which can\nquickly measure complementary properties\nlike proteome, transcrip-tome, and metabolome\nalongside digitisation of\nmedical records. These\nchanges are driving a new\nera in the digitised footprint of medical records.\nThese technologies are\ncurrently still very expen-sive, though some of them\nare more widely used than\nothers. The most prominent example of such a\ntechnology is Magnetic\nResonance Imaging, a\ntechnique which can be\nused to measure metabo-lome.\nHowever, the cost of\nthese devices is quickly\nreducing. The first human\ngenome cost ~ $3 billion\nto sequence, but now the\nindustry cost of sequencing is down to $1000.\nThough the cost of genetic\ntesting is still beyond\nthe regular means of an\naverage earning person,\ncelebrities like Angelina\nJolie have benefited from\nsystems medicine by undergoing genetic testing\nfor susceptibility to breast\ncancer and subsequent\npreventive surgery.\nPrecision medicine has\nbecome the talk of the\ntown in healthcare with\nevery pharmaceutical\ngiant investing heavily\nin it. The rise in data\nhas brought the need for\nsoftware, web pipelines,\nand databases to store the\ndata, as well as new algorithmic based methods\nto analyse them. Google,\nMicrosoft, and Apple\nhave all started investing\nheavily in healthcare.\nGoogle, under its parent\ncompany, has developed\na separate division named\nVerily, specialising in the\nmedical sector. Microsoft, with its \u2018Microsoft\nin Health\u2019 initiative, is\npartnering with healthcare\nexperts to provide robust\ndigital infrastructure for\ntheir data storage, trans-mission, and analysis.\nApple, their longtime\ncompetitor, is also providing similar services in\nthe healthcare sector. This\nparadigm shift with the\nuse of digital technology\nis making the medicine\nsector more accessible to\npatients. In an interview\nwith Mckinsey, Dr. Eric\nSchadt, the founding\ndirector of the Icahn\nInstitute for Genomics\nand Multiscale Biology,\nexplained big data will\nplay the leading role in\nproviding personalised or\nprecise medical solutions\ntailored to each patient.\nThis will be a new era of\nmedicine!\nExam stress? Time to cure your fear of spiders\nI\ns the end of term\ngetting you all\nstressed out? The\nlatest research suggests now may also be\nthe perfect time to tackle\nthat fear of spiders\u2026\nyes, you heard right \u2013\nspiders! A new study\nfrom Professor Oliver\nWolf at Ruhr-University\nBochum has shown\nstress can increase extinction learning, which\nunlinks two previously\npaired stimuli, and\ndrives improvement in\nanxiety therapies.\nExtinction learning is a\nkey component of exposure therapy, which aims\nto reduce anxiety related\nsymptoms by helping the\nbrain unlearn fear-related\nconnections and develop\nnew \u2018safe\u2019 networks. It is\none of the leading strategies for treating anxiety,\npost-traumatic stress\ndisorder, and other related\nconditions. The main\nproblem with exposure\ntherapy however, is that\nit is very dependent on\nthe situation. This means\nthat whilst the harmful\nconnections may be easily\ngeneralisable, the new\n\u2018safe\u2019connections are very\ncontext specific. Since\na therapist\u2019s office does\nnot effectively mimic the\noriginal situation bringing\nabout anxiety, there is an\nincreased likelihood of a\nconnection reforming, and\nthe anxiety association\nreturning.\nThis study was based\non the fact that many of\nthese harmful connections\ncan be formed when the\nbody is subject to a lot\nof stress. Therefore, to\nincrease the generalisabil-ity of extinction therapy,\na mild artificial stress\nresponse was used. In the\ninitial phases of the exper-iment, participants were\nsubjected to a mild electric shock when shown\ncertain coloured light.\nThis meant, understand-ably, that they displayed\nanxiety when shown the\nlights. Subsequently, one\nhalf of group put their\nhands in ice water for\nthree minutes in order to\nprovoke a stress response,\nwhile the other half put\ntheir hands in warm water.\nBoth groups then underwent exposure therapy in a\ndifferent location to where\nthey had acquired the fear.\nKey differences emerged\nthe next day, with the\n\u2018stressed group\u2019 showing\nless relapse of anxiety\nwhen back in the original\nlocation. Previous results\nhave shown that an injection of the stress hormone\ncortisol can increase the\neffectiveness of anxiety\ntreatment; however, this\nstudy provides important\nevidence of an underlying\nmechanism and demonstrated that it can also hold\nacross different situations.\nBesides curing your\ndeep fear of arachnids,\nthis study has great implications in psychiatric\nmedicine, with pharma-cological trials planned\nsoon. Further work is\nplanned by Professor\nWolf\u2019s group to determine\nif this stress response can\nbe used to increase the\neffectiveness of exposure\ntherapy.\nSCIENCE\nVarshit Dusad\nScience Writer\nSCIENCE\nLucy Rowlands\nScience Writer\nBig data is coming to healthcare // CC\nSpider-haters look away now // Wikimedia\n\n"

It is unclear\nhow many of these Thai\npeople have been in the\nUnion Bar on a Friday\nnight.\nHowever, reports from\nCouncil members and\nUnion representatives\nmake it difficult to determine exactly why people\nvoted for the motion.\nPatrick Winbers, the\nUnion\u2019s Vice-Principal\nStudent Voice Consultant, told Hangman: \u201cWe\nbelieve the motion was\nraised in error, but the\ndecision of Union Council\nmust be respected.\nDemocracy is never\nwrong.

Serving wit and darkness in equal measure, Josh Tillman only reaffirms his\nlyrical majesty.\nA\ns a book lover,\nit was a wonderful thing to\ndiscover Father\nJohn Misty. It is simply\nimpossible to get past the\nbrilliant lyrics this man\nhas continuously pumped\nout on all four albums\nreleased under this moni-ker. When listening to the\nstories he has to tell, you\nare completely immersed\nin a child-like trance of\nemotional connection.\nThat said, this does not\nmean the musical side can\nbe neglected when looking at his work. It may\nserve mainly as the vessel\nwithin which he can deliver his beautiful words, but\nhis smooth baritone and\nmeticulously arranged\ncompositions are nothing\nto scoff at. Now that I\u2019ve\ngot my confession of love\nfor the man out of the\nway, I can proceed with\nthe review with a clear\nconscience.\nJosh Tillman\u2019s work\nhas been on an upward\ntrajectory since renaming\nhimself as Father John\nMisty, with every new\nalbum being hailed as his\nbest work. This new LP is\nno different. It\u2019s surprising how elegantly FJM\nis able to discuss the soul\nwrenching topics that he\ndeems important enough\nto share with the world,\nwhile also remaining\ntruthful. The album deals\nwith loss \u2013 of home, of\nloved ones, of purpose\n\u2013 and discusses the\nvarious dark and insidious\nimprints this leaves on the\nhuman soul. Sometimes\nit feels as though people\nwho tell stories of sadness\ndo so sanctimoniously,\nfeeling their sadness\nmakes them unique and\nspecial, but that is the\nexact opposite of what we\nget with Father John.\n\u201cThe soulful\ninquisitor\ncontemplates\ndeath, with\na feeling like\nhe has been\ncornered into\nit\u201d\nHe gets straight to\nthe point in the album\u2019s\ngloomy opener \u2018Hangout\nat the Gallows\u2019. The\nchorus asks the same\nfour questions each time:\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your politics?\n/ What\u2019s your religion?\n/ What\u2019s your intake? /\nYour reason for living?\u201d\n\u2013 these are questions on\na grand scale, questions\neveryone must face up\nto in their lives, and they\nset the tone for the album.\nLacking an answer, the\nsoulful inquisitor contemplates death, with a\nfeeling like he has been\ncornered into it \u2013 \u201cWhose\nbright idea was it to\nsharpen the knives? / Just\ntwenty minutes \u2018fore the\nboat capsize / If you want\nan answer it\u2019s anybody\u2019s\nguess / I\u2019m treading water\nas I bleed to death.\u201d The\nappeal of death in such an\ninescapably depressing\nexistential crisis finally\nbecomes most apparent in\nthe lines: \u201cSo you wanna\nhang out at the gallows?\n/ Those guys get an early\nstart.\u201d A dark opener\nindeed.\nThis is followed by the\nbrilliant \u2018Mr. Tillman\u2019,\nwhere FJM uses his\nalter-ego to tell a ridiculously exaggerated story\nof the alienated existence\nof a musician always\non the move. Hotels\nare a constant theme\nthroughout the album, a\nsymbol of detachment\nand an unbalanced life.\nHere, the verses are told\nintermittently by a hotel\nreceptionist worried about\nMr. Tillman\u2019s bizarre\nbehaviour: \u201cAnd oh, a\nreminder about our policy\n/ Don\u2019t leave the mattress\nin the rain if you sleep\non the balcony\u201d which\nis followed by the elated\nresponse of the apparently\nintoxicated subject: \u201cI\u2019m\nfeeling good / Damn, I\u2019m\nfeeling so fine / I\u2019m living\non a cloud above an island\nin my mind.\u201d The song\nhas a remarkably catchy\nmelody and fades out with\nthe accompaniment of\nsome careless whistling,\nimplying the notion of\na mind on the wane or\nperhaps merely past\ncaring.\nThe lowest point of the\nalbum is \u2018The Palace\u2019.\nThe subject\u2019s desolation\nhas escalated to completely new heights, the jokes\nare dry and reek of the\nharrowing self-contempt\nendemic to depression:\n\u201cLast night I wrote a poem\n/ Man, I must have been in\nthe poem zone\u2026 Maybe\nI\u2019ll get a pet / Learn how\nto take care of somebody\nelse / Maybe I\u2019ll name\nhim Jeff.\u201d\nThe album\u2019s mood does\npick up after this and \u2018Disappointing Diamonds Are\nthe Rarest of Them All\u2019,\none of the most beautiful\non the album, compares\nthe crazy, out-of-the-blue\nlove that sometimes\ngrabs hold of us to both a\npervert on a crowded bus\nand an oil tanker tipped\nat sea \u2013 an unwanted contamination but, as he says,\n\u201cDoes everybody have to\nbe the greatest story ever\ntold?\u201d\nIt feels as though the\nlyrical subject does indeed\nreach some point of reconciliation with his life\nat the end of the album.\n(\u201cI\u2019m in the business\nof living / yeah, that\u2019s\nsomething I\u2019d say\u201d). The\nmoral lesson he leaves us\nwith is a powerful one,\nit tells of the disillusionment that can come from\nplanting your feet too\nfirmly in what you have:\n\u201cBeware the man who has\neverything / Everything\nthat he wants\u2026 I\u2019m out\nhere testing the maxim /\nThat all good things have\nto stop.\u201d\nLife is hard, there\u2019s no\ngetting around that, but\nI feel that a great deal\nof comfort can be taken\nfrom feeling like someone\nunderstands exactly how\nyou feel. It is not easy to\nbuild such a rapport with\nfans that are thousands of\nmiles away, but in listening to Father John Misty\u2019s\nmusic you really gain\na sense of the universal\npresence of pain \u2013 that he\nfeels the same as you do.\nHe seems to be moulding\nthe demons inside him in\nclay right in front of you.\nHis lyrics feel like he\u2019s\nhaving the most honest of\nconversations with you.\nThis has always been a\nstrong suit of folk music\nand with every new album\nit feels like FJM\u2019s songs\nbelong in the vault with\nthe canonical works of\nBob, Neil, and Graham.\nThinkin bout dat boi xxx // Sub Pop\nMUSIC\nMartin Flerin\nMusic Writer\nArtist: Father John Misty.\nLabel: Sub Pop.

That\u2019s\nnot to say I\u2019m excusing\nKanye\u2019s recent pro-Trump\nstance or \u201cslavery is a\nchoice\u201d ramblings, I\u2019m\njust saying that I will treat\nhim with a fair deal of\npatience, as anyone with\na mental health condition\nshould be treated.\nof headphones. There are\na lot of production and\nvocal nuances which, if\nmissed, may cause the\ninto subdued rapping\nwhich is sweet until an\nabrasive beat switch\nup kind of ruins things.\nAnother experimental\nmoment on the project that\ndoes not pay off is \u2018All\nMine\u2019. Jeremih\u2019s Young\nThug impression on the\nchorus is jarring and the\nsparse drums accentuating\nKanye\u2019s confession of all\nthe \u201cbasic\u201d girls he craves\nonly comes off as tacky.\n\u2018Yikes\u2019 sounds like\nthe sequel to \u2018FML\u2019\nfrom The Life of Pablo,\nthough a sonically and\nlyrically lesser version.\n\u2018Wouldn\u2019t Leave\u2019 and\n\u2018Violent Crimes\u2019 are odes\nto his wife and daughter\nrespectively. The former\nis a soft admission of the\nstrain his recent actions\nput on his marriage and\nKim\u2019s tender loyalty. The\nlatter, the last track on the\nalbum, is a pretty simple\nbut endearing insight\ninto Kanye\u2019s anxiety\nsurrounding the attention\nhis daughter is bound to\nget when she grows up.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you grow up in a\nhurry\u201d 070 Shake croons\non the chorus.

While\nNatalie Prass was full of\nrounded sounds \u2013 soaring\nviolins and glowing\nbrass \u2013 The Future and\nthe Past is indebted to\n\u201870s funk, lounge jazz,\nand neo-soul. \u2018Far From\nYou\u2019, a tribute to Karen\nCarpenter, is Prass at her\nmost Spacebomb-esque,\nbut is followed by \u2018Ain\u2019t\nNobody\u2019, whose high-hat\nbeat and bleep-bloop\nbaseline mark a turning\npoint in Prass\u2019 career.\nLyrically, the record\nis markedly different.\nOn \u2018Oh My\u2019, she takes\nshots at modern politics,\nasking \u201cwhat is lying to\na cheat?\u201d while \u2018Hot for\nthe Mountain\u2019 centres\naround the refrain of \u2018we\ncan take you all\u2019. \u2018Shop\nGo Down\u2019 and \u2018Nothing\nto Say\u2019 both speak of\nbrewing storm \u2013 whether\nthat\u2019s one of resistance or\ntrouble it\u2019s hard to gauge.\n\u2018Sisters\u2019 may take the\nidea of protest lyrics a bit\nliterally \u2013 \u201dcome on nasty\nwomen / so all the bad\ngirls here\u2019 let\u2019s make that\nclear\u201d \u2013 but then again,\nso did \u2018Blowing in the\nWind\u2019, so there are few\ncomplaints.\nThe Future and the\nPast is a bold, assured\nfollow-up to Prass\u2019\nlong-delayed debut.

Why\nand how, exactly, did \u2018Big\nEdie\u2019 and \u2018Little Edie\u2019\nBeale, the mother-daugh-ter duo, lock themselves\ninside their decrepit mansion in the East Hamptons\nfor decades, slowly accumulating the oppressive\nweight of squalor, rubbish,\nand hostility from wealthy\nneighbours?\nBrothers Albert and\nDavid Maysles were the\nfirst to shine a light on\nthe pair in their seminal\ncin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 film Grey\nGardens, which has gone\non to inspire an HBO\ndrama and a Broadway\nmusical. The two Edies\nhave become a cultural\ntouchstone, not only for\nwhat they said \u2013 Little\nEdie: \u201cI only care about\nthree things: singing,\ndancing, and the Catholic\nchurch\u201d \u2013 but for what\nthey represented. As all\nromantics know, there is\nbeauty found in ruins.\nThat Summer, a documentary from Swedish\ndirector G\u00f6ran Olsson,\nhelps to fill in some of the\ngaps left by the original\nfilm, making it a must-see\nfor any Beale enthusiasts.\nLike his earlier film,\nConcerning Violence,\nthe work consists mainly\nof found footage \u2013 the\nmajority from the\nMaysles, along with some\nfrom Andy Warhol and\nJonas Mekas. The film\nprovides an invaluable\ninsight into the development of Grey Gardens:\nPeter Beard, artist and\nfriend of socialite Lee\nRadziwill (herself the\nsister of Jackie Kennedy)\nhired the Maysles to shoot\nfootage of the redevelopment of the Grey Gardens\nestate, and the two eccentrics at its centre. The film\nwas eventually scrapped,\nalthough the Maysles obviously returned to shoot\ntheir masterpiece \u2013 with\nor without the consent of\nBeard or Radziwill, it\u2019s\nnever made clear.\nThat Summer presents\nus with the four extant\nreels of film from that\nearly project, giving us a\npeek behind the curtain\nof the mansion. Unfortunately, we are forced\nto sit through a sequence\nof Beard pontificating on\nhis celebrity connections\nbefore we are able to get\nto experience the grainy\nmajesty of the reels.\nAs with the Maysles,\nOlsson allows the Beales\nto speak for themselves,\nuttering lines that are\ninnately brilliant, by\nturns hilarious, poignant,\nand beautiful \u2013 they are\na scriptwriter\u2019s dream.\nWhile the reels run to\nlittle more than an hour\nin length, they provide a\nwonderful companion to\nthe original film. Fans of\nGrey Gardens will delight\nin sequences that preempt\nits key themes \u2013 Racoons!\nSinging! Little Edie\u2019s\noutfits! \u2013 but for every\nanswer the film provides\nmore questions are raised:\nwere the Maysles being\nexploitative? Why did\nLittle Edie allow herself to\nbecome a recluse? What\u2019s\nwith all the headscarves?\nThat Summer provides\na long-overdue update\non the iconic East Coast\neccentrics; let us hope\nmore footage is unearthed\none day.\nFran\u00e7ois Ozon\u2019s sexual thriller fails to ignite\nW\nith Amant\nD o u b l e ,\nthere is the\nsense that\nFrench director Fran\u00e7ois\nOzon is returning to\nwhere he is most comfort-able: sexual psychodrama.\nWhile Ozon\u2019s filmography has some notable\nexceptions \u2013 the high-camp comedy Potiche\namong them \u2013 he seems\nto be most at home when\nstraddling the line between erotica and horror.\nNow, after several films\nthat explored different\ngenres, he has gone back\nto his roots, ploughing\nthe same furrow of some\nof his best works: Under\nthe Sand, Swimming Pool,\nand In the House.\nAmant Double is,\ntherefore, a double disap-pointment, both for what\nit is, and the realisation\nof what it could have\nbeen. Marine Vacth plays\nChlo\u00e9, a withdrawn young\nwoman suffering from\nstomach pains, which\ndoctors insist are psychological in origin. She sees\na charming young psy-chiatrist, Paul (J\u00e9r\u00e9mie\nRenier), who calls off\ntheir sessions after falling\nin love with her, thus\nallowing them to begin a\nphysical relationship. Of\ncourse, their happiness\ncannot last for long, and\n\u2013 after happening to see\na man who looks exactly\nlike Paul \u2013 Chlo\u00e9 stumbles\nupon his identical twin\nbrother Louis, also a psy-chiatrist, with whom she\nembarks on an affair. Paul\ndenies the existence of\nLouis, and, as she tries to\nuncover the truth, Chlo\u00e9\nveers closer and closer to\nhystria.\nStylistically, this is\nOzon at his most indul-gent, taking cues from\nBergman, Hitchcock, and\nCronenberg to create a\ntableau of imaginative,\nthrilling images. The\nopening sequence, which\nreplicates Psycho\u2019s\ndrain-eye cut with a far\nmore intimate part of the\nanatomy, is worth the admission price alone, as is\nthe introductory analysis\nsequence, in which split\nscreens show the same\nsequence from different\nangles, disrupting the idea\nof the camera-as-eye.\nIn terms of the plot,\nalthough based on a Joyce\nCarol Oates short story,\nOzon borrows liberally\nfrom classics such as\nVertigo and Rosemary\u2019s\nBaby. He even puts\nMyriam Boyer in as a\nwonderfully invasive\nneighbour, with shades of\nRuth Gordon\u2019s imposing\nmatriarch. Unfortunately,\nwhile the sexual elements\nmay be subversive, little\nelse is. While films like\nRosemary\u2019s Baby explore\nthe way women\u2019s lived\nexperienced are written\noff as hysteria, Ozon only\npartly tackles this idea. He\nends up reinforcing boring\nideas around pregnancy\nand neurosis.\nVacth has developed\nsince her role in Jeune et\nJolie, but still retains an air\nof impassive hauteur that\ncan be difficult to enjoy.\nRenier is much stronger,\nplaying both twins with\nequal aplomb, despite\nopposing personalities.\nAmant Double is a\nlot of fun, and \u2013 while it\ncould certainly do with\na sharp trim \u2013 most of it\nrattles along at an enjoy-able, campy pace. By\nratcheting up the drama to\nten pretty much from the\noff, however, Ozon loses\nus long before the credits\nroll.\n\u2018There\u2019s nothing worse than dealing with a staunch character\u2019 // Dogwoof\nFILM\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nDir: G\u00f6ran Olsson.\nStarring: Peter Beard; Lee\nRadziwill; Edith Bouvier\nBeale; Edith \u2018Little Edie\u2019\nBouvier Beale. 80 minutes\nTHAT SUMMER\nFILM\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nDir: Fran\u00e7ois Ozon.

To\nthose of you who have finished exams, may I extend\nmy congratulations; and\nto those that have not,\nI shall laugh pityingly\nwhilst sipping a scotch.\nMay your efforts extend\nto barely attaining a pass\nthis year.\nI think that there are\nseveral signs indicating\nwhen British summer\nofficially begins: the end\nof the nice weather and\nthe sudden onslaught of\novercast skies; the sight\nof the first gammon wandering around with his\nshirt off and his sunburnt\ntits out for all to see; and,\nmore recently, the start of\nthe sexually-charged narcissist\u2019s paradise that is\nLove Island. As it features\nin a Grumpy Bastard, you\ncan of course assume that\nI fucking despise it.\nAs a show, it has one\nbasic premise: the executives at ITV, clearly driven\nto distraction by the declining viewership of Big\nBrother, came up with the\nbright idea to do the same\nprogramme, but with a\ntwist. Why not make sure\nthat all the people are\nquite attractive, almost\nuniversally the same\nshade of orange, and also\nhave about as much grey\nmatter between them as\nyour average cockroach?\nAll the characters\nhave so little depth, if\nthe participants were a\nswimming pool, they\nwouldn\u2019t even be able to\ndrown a paralysed quad-riplegic. Other than the\ncompelling cast, the show\nhas a magnificent way of\nmanufacturing tension,\nwhereby if an individual\nis single by the end of the\nweek, they will be sent off\nthe island.\nIn order to prevent all\nof the cast becoming comfortable with each other,\nthe producers drip feed\nnew meat onto the show\nand create conflict through\nthe use of challenges and\nan ever imbalanced male\nto female ratio. Quite\nfrankly, that\u2019s about as\nmuch of an explanation\nas I\u2019m willing to give. I\ncould explain some of the\nnuance, but there just isn\u2019t\nany. It is probably the most\nblatant sex-sells success\nthat anyone, except from\nmaybe Playboy, has ever\npulled off.\nThe whole concept\nof Love Island has now\nconvinced me that when\nthey have run out of attractive people to feature\n\u2013 and in Britain that will\nbe fairly soon \u2013 the next\nlogical step that ITV\nwill take is to run real\ngladiatorial fights, where\nthe victor is rewarded by\nbeing able to sleep with\nthe man/woman they\nchoose, and the loser has\nto desperately claw at\ntheir intestines as they pile\nup on the ground. It would\nprobably be as compelling\nas Love Island and I\u2019m\nsure people would make\nthe same excuses as to\nwhy they watch it, about it\nbeing ironic. Don\u2019t lie to\nyourself. You need these\npeople to watch and laugh\nat as they pathetically\nimitate romance in real\nlife, all whilst wearing no\nclothes, because it makes\nyou feel superior at the\nsame time as giving you a\nraging erection.\n\u201cLove Island is\nnothing more\nthan a colossal\nturd in the\nform of a light\nentertainment\nprogramme\u201d\nThanks to people like\nyou, Western Civilization\nis doomed.\nAre you sentient?\nDo you have opinions?\nDo you want to share\nthem in Felix?!\nWRITE FOR COMMENT\nCOMMENT.FELIX@IC.AC.UK\nCultural appropriation should not be\ntrivialised\nBME Officer Chimdi Igwe responds to last week\u2019s article and thinks people need to appreciate\nwhat cultural appropriation really means.\nCOMMENT\nChimdi Igwe\nBME Officer\nO\nver the past nine\nor so months\n(and, if I\u2019m\nhonest, much\nearlier than that), I\u2019ve\noften found myself being\nthrust into conversations\naround topics of race, eth-nicity, and identity. More\nthan once, I\u2019ve been asked\nall manner of questions or\nfor my take on a number\nof issues, many of which\nI haven\u2019t really cared for.\nBut nothing gets under\nmy skin quite like the\nmention of \u2018cultural\nappropriation\u2019 \u2013 so much\nso that I have to suppress\nthe urge to roll my eyes\ndramatically each time it\u2019s\nuttered.\nNevertheless, I couldn\u2019t\nhelp but cringe when\nreading a piece published\nin the Comment section\nof Felix last week. The\narticle was centred around\nthe news story that broke\nof a young woman who\nwas met with criticism\nonline for wearing a traditional classical Chinese\ndress to her high school\nprom.\nThough the article\u2019s\ntone was meant to be\nsatirical at best (which is\ngiving it a lot), I felt unnecessarily vexed by the\nlacklustre approach to discussing the idea of cultural\nappropriation. Despite\nmy general discomfort\nwith broaching this topic\nwhen often asked about\nit, I decided it would be\namiss to sweep this under\nthe table without making a\nrebuttal of sorts.\nWith academic sociological concepts, the\ngeneral trend has been\nthat their definitions\nbecome diluted as they\nmove from the realm of\nacademia to the mass\npublic (you could say as\nthey get \u2018appropriated\u2019),\ntaking on meanings which\npoorly reflect their defini-tions. One good example\nis the tendency to misuse\nthe word \u2018racism\u2019 in situations where, going by\nits original definition, it\ndoes not necessary apply\n(anyone who went to a\nmulticultural secondary\nschool will likely have\nwitnessed this).\nLike everything to\ndo with liberation work,\ncultural appropriation is\nabout power dynamics\non the societal level (I\u2019ve\nput this in bold because if\nyou take nothing else from\nthis article, understand\nthis). When academics\ntalk about cultural appro-priation, they are looking\nat how a society can\nembrace a culture whilst\nrejecting its source: the\npeople.\nOf course, culture is\nfluid and flows across the\nworld \u2013 \u201cno man is an\nisland\u201d,afterall.Welivein\na European country whose\nnational dish is apparently\nchicken tikka masala. But\nfalse equivalencies exist,\nand the article was riddled\nwith them in all forms. I\nwill try to break down the\nmore pertinent ones.\nFirstly, wearing\nWestern clothing in\na Western country is\nnot appropriation, it is\nassimilation. Neither is\nundertaking a Western\neducation (which itself\ngreatly benefitted from\nIslamic scholars in areas\nsuch as mathematics).\nMy foremothers walked\naround their communities\ncompletely bare-chested\nwith the utmost confidence and with no shame\n(not so much anymore).\nImagine the front pages\nof the tabloids if my\ngrandmother did this now.\nCountless headlines have\nbeen published in which\npeople have complained\nabout Islamic faith schools\n\u2013 that they don\u2019t embrace\n\u2018Western education\u2019 and\n\u2018British values\u2019 (neither\nare quite true).\nSecondly, there is\nsuch a thing as cultural\nexchange. In this case,\nthere is a mutual benefit to\nboth cultures in question.\nThough I know very little\nabout Malaysian culture,\nI do come from a country\nof over 200 ethnic groups;\nfashion, music and slang\nflow around.\njuvenile, and that we had\n\u201cactual important things\u201d\nto focus on. In any area\nof liberation, dismissive\napathy can be more dangerous that outright op-pression. As an Imperial\nstudent who has taken\nthe time out of their day\nto write an article about\nsomething for which they\ndon\u2019t care, I\u2019m sure the\nwriter is capable of caring\nabout more than one issue\nat a time.\nThis man is probably not a Sioux warrior // Flickr\n\u201cWearing\nWestern\nclothing in\na Western\ncountry is\nassimilation,\nnot\nappropriation\u201d\nThirdly, and most im-portantly, we can\u2019t ignore\ncolonisation. Much of the\nconversation about appropriation tends to focus on\nthe United States, often\naround Native and/or\nblack American culture\n\u2013 groups of people who\nhistorically have been oppressed and suppressed in\nsociety. When a group of\npeople have been forced\nto isolate their culture\nfrom the mainstream for\nwhatever reason, can they\ntruly be blamed for feeling\nangry when you try to\nincorporate their culture\ninto your own whilst\nignoring their grievances?\nWhat really bothered\nme about the article\nwas the dismissive way\nthe writer approached\nappropriation, suggesting\nthat talking about appropriation was somehow\nI\u2019d just like to clarify\nat this point that I personally didn\u2019t care much\nfor the debates online\nas to whether or not that\nyoung woman appropriated Chinese culture. The\nspeed at which people\nlabel something as \u2018appropriative\u2019 is concerning,\nand many times the term\nis incorrectly used. That\u2019s\nnot an excuse to throw the\nbaby out with the bathwa-ter.\nThe line between\nappreciation and appropriation is thin, and it\u2019s\na real headache trying to\nmap it. But to pretend that\nthe latter is fiction is just\nbeing obtuse. And that\u2019s\nnever a good look.\n\n"

It prevents\nus from feeling lost, adrift\nin a universe without any\nkind of meaning.\nIt is also, as Daniel\nLopatin \u2013 who has been\nworking for the past\ndecade under the moniker\nOneohtrix Point Never,\nproducing gradually more\nelaborate experimental\nconstructions \u2013 is at pains\nto point out, completely\nmeaningless. As part of\nthe ephemera surrounding\nhis latest release, Age Of,\nLoptain has created his\nown system of chronolo-gy, loosely based on the\nprogression of human\nhistory from agrarian\narcadia, to capitalist\neconomy, to post-indus-trial wasteland: the Ade\nog Ecco, Age of Harvest,\nAge of Excess, and Age\nof Bondage. It\u2019s a vague\nsystem, one that has the\nadvantage of being able\nto fit any situation, like\nthe historical version of\na pseudoscience. It is this\nsubversion that Loptain\ndelights in. \u201cIt is really the\nmost satisfying thing you\ncan do,\u201d he told the New\nYork Times, \u201cput a little\nscratch in something\u2026\nthat has the arrogance of\nknowing what it is.\u201d\n\u201cOneohtrix\nPoint Never\nhas always\nexisted at the\nmargins of pop\nmusic\u201d\nWith Age Of, he\u2019s not\nletting us stay in one\nplace long enough to even\nattempt to discover what\nthings are: at every turn,\nLopatin will upend our\nexpectations, subverting\nwhat we have come to\nexpect in a regular form\nof music. On \u2018Babylon\u2019,\nfor example, pipes whistle\nand flutter, joined by\nLoptain\u2019s own vocod-er-ed voice, anchored\nto the baseline from the\nTwin Peaks theme. It is,\nperhaps, the closest he has\ncome to a straightforward\npop song, until it suddenly\ncuts out, plunging us into\nacoustic darkness, as if\nsomething had blown\na fuse in the recording\nstudio.\nIn \u2018Toys 2\u2019, Lopatin\noffers up a proof of\nconcept for a potential\nsoundtrack to a Pixar film.\nThe track starts off with\nsome straightforward\npanpipes and whistling,\nbuilding in a crescendo\nthat wouldn\u2019t sound out\nof place in a Disney film,\nover a scuttling beat of\npops and clicks. But then\nthe notes pile up, building\nto a cacophony of black\nMIDI-esque horror. The\nfact the track was named,\nnot in reference to the\nmuch-loved Toy Story,\nbut rather after Toys, the\n1992 Robin Williams\nnightmare-fuel, points to\nits sensibility.\nOneohtrix Point Never\nis always a project that\nhas existed at the margins\nof pop music, scuttling\naround its edge like a\ndark crustacean. Loptain\nclips and borrows from\nthe language of modern\npop \u2013 glassy synths,\ndeep baselines \u2013 while\nretaining the syntax of\nexperimental music,\nthrowing in references to\ncyberpunk, postmodern\nphilosophy, and 1990s\ninternet culture. The result\nis a sound existing within\na liminal space, unan-chored. \u2018The Station\u2019, a\ntrack originally intended\nfor Usher, demonstrates\nthis tendency, juxtaposing\nits autotuned vocals with\nan underlying static, as if\nwarning us of a coming\nstorm within the void.\nThe result is a sound\nthat, although deeply\nentrenched within a mesh\nof referents, remains un-tethered from reality.\nLopatin has also taken\non more pop sensibilities\nin terms of the production\nof this album, which is his\nmost collaborative yet.\nAfter producing tracks for\nANOHNI\u2019s album Hopelessness back in 2016, she\nreturns the favour, lending\nher haunting vocals to a\nnumber of pieces. Noise\nartist Prurient is also\nenlisted, echoing back\nLoptain\u2019s words, the\nscreaming overlaid in a\nwailing electroshock of\nnoise. James Blake came\non board to help with the\nfinal mixing of the work.\nLuckily all these collaborators manage to fit into\nLopatin\u2019s sonic universe.\nCinematic is a word\noften used to describe\nmusic like Oneohtrix\nPoint Never\u2019s, which\nmakes use of expanse and\naural imagery. But the\nterm is a lazy one, which\nbelies what Loptain is\nreally trying to do: he is\nnot creating a film, but\nan entire world. From the\nplinking harpsichord on\nopening \u2018Age of\u2019, which\nquickly disintegrates\ninto the sonic equivalent\nof a retro-futuristic city\nbuilder game played\nthrough a busted VHS\nmachine, through to the\ncover art \u2013 a work by Jim\nShaw work entitled \u2018The\nGreat Whatsit\u2019, in which\nthree women, half-Logan\u2019s Run, half choose\nyour own adventure\nnovel, gaze admiringly up\nabove a glowing macbook\n\u2013 with this album Lopatin\nis free-associating within\na structure of controlled\ncomplexity.\nSocieties tending\ntowards decay. The\nphilosophical problem of\nnuclear waste disposal.\nTheories of a post-sin-gularity world. These\nare all ingredients added\ntogether in a blender by\nLoptain, resulting in a\nmusical collage that defies\ndescription. Age Of is an\nalbum that makes use of\na well-known toolbox\nin totally unexpected\nways. Difficult? Perhaps.\nExceptional?

For Fans Of:\nHolly Herndon; ANOHNI;\nLaurel Halo. 43 minutes\nAGE OF\nKing Push reigns supreme on DAYTONA\nP\nusha T is one of\nthe few prominent\nrappers from the\nfirst decade of\nthe 2000s to side-step any\nwaning in his relevance\nsince then. He\u2019s achieved\nwhat a Lupe Fiasco or\na 50 Cent were not able\nto by inhabiting a space\nsomewhere in between\n\u2013 he raps about a street\nlifestyle with a heavily\nlyrical delivery that is\noften cryptic and full of\nreferences. Since the end\nof his Clipse/Re-Up Gang\nera, Pusha\u2019s solo career\nhas only grown more suc-cessful, having been made\npresident of Kanye\u2019s\nG.O.O.D Music in 2015\nand releasing a few decent\nmixtapes and two great\nalbums since 2011. His\nlast album, King Push \u2013\nDarkest Before Dawn:\nThe Prelude, was his best\nto date, featuring gritty,\ndark beats and typical\nwitty lyricism. That brings\nus here, to the album\nthat was supposed to be\nKing Push, now renamed\nDAYTONA, with similarly\nunexpected cover art of\nWhitney Houston\u2019s drug\nfilled bathroom, selected\nby Kanye two days before\nits release. In fact, this\nis perhaps Push\u2019s most\nKanye-influenced album\nwith the alarmingly short\nalbum length and the\nproduction from start to\nfinish being the work of\nYe himself.\nDAYTONA starts with\nthe incredible \u2018If You\nKnow You Know\u2019. The\nsong\u2019s production is\ninfectiously chopped and\nlayered with a mind of\nits own, distorted vocal\nsamples weaving in\nand out at just the right\nmoments. Another neat\ntouch I should point out\nin the production: the\ninstrumental on each song\nof this project flows into\nthe next seamlessly. Push\npacks his verses on this\nfirst track with references\nand imagery that only a\n\u201ctrapper turned rapper\u201d\nsuch as himself would\nfully appreciate, with\nlines such as \u201cI predict\nsnow, Al Roker / I only\never looked up to Sosa\n/ You all get a bird, this\nnigga Oprah\u201d. The production on the next track,\n\u2018The Games We Play\u2019,\nbecomes simpler but just\nas effective. Powerful\nhorns come crushing\ndown periodically with\nloose guitar plucks and\ndrum claps filling the gaps\nbetween, while Push lays\ndown braggadocious bars\nwith no interruptions. \u201cI\nam your Ghost and your\nRae / This is my Purple\nTape, save up for rainy\ndays\u201d he claims, a particularly clever line referring\nto the Raekwon and\nGhostface album, Only\nBuilt 4 Cuban Linx\u2026,\nwhich was nicknamed the\nPurple Tape and included\nthe song \u2018Rainy Dayz\u2019.\nThe project then\nsimmers as it leads into\nthe track \u2018Hard Piano\u2019,\nwith the production doing\npretty much what the title\npromises. A piano melody\nloops itself, becoming\nslightly boring by the end\nof the track, especially\nalongside Rick Ross\u2019\nforgettable verse. The\nchorus is a pretty glamorous moment though,\nwith Tony Williams\nsinging about the drug\ncapital Santo Domingo.\nThe next track definitely\npicks up, beginning with\na dramatic sample of\nThe Mighty Hannibal\nspeaking about addiction.\nThe beat then abruptly\ncuts in; a minimalistic but\nheavy thumping bass that\ndemands headbanging.\nIt\u2019s grimy and dark and\nperfectly matches Push\u2019s\nmean, pronounced flow.\nThe bass melts away\nagain for the chorus,\nanother emotive soul\nsample, before coming\nright back in for the\nsecond verse. We then\nflow into the emotional\ncentre-piece of the album\n\u2013 \u2018Santeria\u2019. Push mourns\nthe tragic murder of his\nroad manager, De\u2019Von\nPickett, with the production perfectly matching\nhis bars. First, we get the\nmature but cold side of his\npain matched by an eerie\nelectric guitar refrain.\nThe eeriness comes to a\nhead at the chorus as 070\nShake sings a ghostly\nSpanish echo over synth\nhums. Push comes back\nin sounding more sombre,\nwith lines such as \u201cDarken\nmy doorstep, they told me\nthe day\u2019s gone\u201d, before\nthe beat switches again\nto aggressive, clattering\ndrums and Push becomes\nmore menacing, implying\nthat he will \u201cdraw blood\u201d\nas reparation.\nA similarly ominous\nsounding beat is maintained for \u2018What Would\nMeek Do?\u2019, which sees\nYe and Push each spit\na verse on how they\nrespond to those \u201ctalking\nshit\u201d. Push\u2019s verse is full\nof materialistic bragging\nand cites Meek Mill,\nrecently released from a\nridiculously harsh prison\nsentence, as the devil\non his shoulder. Kanye\ndelivers a pretty impressive verse also, complete\nwith a suggestion that the\nMAGA hat he infamously\ndonned will make him\nexempt from racial profil-ing.\nThe last track on the\nalbum is \u2018Infrared\u2019. The\nbeat is loose and echoey\nwith a looped sample that\nworks well. Pusha raps\nwithout a hook on this\nsong, which is appropriate\nbecause he has a lot to\nsay. A subliminal Pusha\nT vs Drake, Birdman, and\nLil Wayne beef has been\npresent since 2011, though\nas of this album the most\nattention it had gotten was\non Drake\u2019s \u2018Two Birds,\nOne Stone\u2019 where he\nquestioned Push\u2019s street\ncredibility. On \u2018Infrared\u2019,\nPusha T responds to this\nwith very explicit shots\nat all three Young Money\nassociates. The bars that\nhe directs at Drake mock\nhis reliance on a ghost\nwriter, arguably a brave\nmove since this was the\nexact jab that began the\nDrake-Meek beef of\n2015, which Meek undeniably lost. Indeed, Drake\nresponded to \u2018Infrared\u2019\nless than a day after the\nrelease of this album\nwith \u2018Duppy Freestyle\u2019,\na pretty scathing attack\non not only Push, but\nKanye too. Drake made\none mistake though \u2013 he\nmentioned Push\u2019s fiance\u2019s\nname. It was this that Push\nwould cite as his trigger\nafter releasing the savage\n\u2018The Story of Adidon\u2019as a\nresponse. Within the one-verse track, Push pulls all\nof Drake\u2019s skeletons out\nthe closet \u2013 his absent,\ndowdy father; the child\nthat he has been keeping a\nsecret and from whose life\nDrake himself has been\nabsent; the lack of time\nleft for Drake\u2019s terminally\nill producer, arguably\nthe contributing factor to\nDrake\u2019s popularity. The\nonly thing Drake has\noffered since this public\ncrucifixion is a statement\nattempting to explain the\nsong\u2019s shocking cover\nart \u2013 a genuine photo of\nDrake in black face. If\nyou ask me, when you\u2019re\nreplying to a diss track\nwith a press release, you\nhave officially lost the\nbeef. Rest in peace Drake,\nwhile the internet rekindles its pre-2015 love\naffair of memeing you.\nIn all honesty though,\nthe real losers of this rap\nbeef are anyone sleeping\non this excellent album.\nDAYTONA is proof that\nPusha T and Kanye are\nstill the only ones who\nknow how to make what\nthey make: lyrical, luxury\ndrug raps and hard,\nbumping beats that hit you\nright in the chest. Put the\ntwo together and clearly,\nyou get a masterpiece.\nDAYTONA // GOOD\nMUSIC\nAsad Raja\nMusic Writer\nArtist: Pusha T. Label:\nG.O.O.D. Music. Top\nTracks: If You Know You\nKnow.

Born\nin England to a GreekCypriot family, he lived\nin London until he was\na few years old, before\ngoing to Cyprus for about\nsix months. Surrounded\nby family members, all\nchattering away in Greek,\nthe English he had managed to pick up in his first\nfew years of being verbal\nvanished, to be replaced\nby the language of his\nextended family. When\nhe returned to London, he\nneeded to relearn English\nall over again; at this\nyoung age, he was made\naware not only of how he\nwas viewed as \u2018foreign\u2019\nby fellow children and\nparents, but also how\nlanguage can delicately\ntie you to a sense of time\nand place.\nThis anecdote was\nwhat came to mind when\nreading N\u00e9gar Djavadi\u2019s\ndebut novel, Disoriental.\nFirst published in 2016\nin French, it has now\nbeen translated into\nEnglish by Tina Kover\nfor Europa Editions; this\ntranslation adds another\nlayer of meaning to a\nnovel already steeped in\nquestions of belonging\nand history. Disoriental\nis a story about identity,\nor \u2013 rather \u2013 the effects of\na lack of identity.\nThe central character is\nKimi\u00e2 Sadr, one of three\nsisters born to a family\nof intellectuals living\nthrough the tumultuous\nIranian revolution. We\nopen the novel with her\nsittinginafertilityclinicin\nParis, awaiting the results\nof tests; in the quiet of the\nwaiting room, she begins\nto float back through her\nown memories, exploring\nthe story of her family,\ntracing its generations.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more\nthan a hint\nof magical\nrealism in\nDjavadi\u2019s\ndescriptions of\nthe Sadrs\u201d\n\u201cFor a debut\nnovel,\nDisoriental\nis hugely\nimpressive\u201d\nThere\u2019s more than a\nhint of magical realism\nin Djavadi\u2019s descriptions\nof the Sadr family, which\nreaches far back into the\nhistory of Iran. We have\nchildren born in harems,\nregressive sky-blue eyes\nmarking out genetic\nlineage, multi-generation-al conflicts, and a set of\nsix brothers spread across\nthe globe. It\u2019s dizzying,\nbrilliant stuff, but Djavadi\nmanages to keep a tight\nenough hand on the plot\nto prevent it spiralling out\ninto absurdity.\nDjavadi is particularly\ngood at balancing the\nsurreal with the real. Her\nheady descriptions, which\nhave a mystical air, are\nkept grounded by references to the real-world\nturmoil going on around\nthem: on one page, she\u2019ll\nbuild up the image of\nKimi\u00e2\u2019s mother Sara and\nher neighbour as fated\ntwins \u2013 \u201cThe children had\nthe comforting sense of\nhaving to mothers\u2026one\nbrunette mother, Sara,\nwho worked and knew\nhow to console and to\nlisten; and another, who\nvaried between chestnut,\nblonde, and sometimes red\nhair, Big Mina, who didn\u2019t\nwork and who organised\ngames and enormous\nafternoon snacks.\u201d \u2013 and\nthen undercut this with\na direct reference to\nthe impact of American\noppression on Iranian\nculture. \u201cImperialism is\nno joke!\u201d Djavadi says\nwith a sly grin.\nIn this sense, Disoriental reminded me most\nof some of the best work\nof Salman Rushdie and\nIsabel Allende, which\nbalanced political seriousness with the impossible lightness of magical\nrealism.\nOf course, we know\nfrom the off that Kimi\u00e2\nhas now made it to Paris,\nand left her homeland\nbehind, unable to return,\nmeaning the grounding\nwork Djavadi does with\nher family narrative\nmakes the point of departure that much harder.\nDjavadi draws on her\nown life in these sections,\nhaving travelled across\nthe Kurdistani mountains\nwith her sister and mother,\nafter her family opposed\nthe Khomeini regime.\nOnce the family make\nit to Paris, Djavadi magnificently explores how\nlanguage not only allows\nfor communication, but\nallows for identity. Kimi\u00e2\nis \u201cconfronted by a world\nthat I could see and touch\nbut didn\u2019t know how to\ntalk about\u201d \u2013 robbed of\nthe means of describing\nwords \u201cfrom peaceful\nlives, lives that belong to\nthe people living them.\u201d\nDepression, for Kimi\u00e2, is\na word \u201cwhose meaning\nI finally understood in\nParis\u201d, highlighting both\nthe isolating effect of\nbecoming the \u2018other\u2019, and\nthe way concepts don\u2019t\nalways translate between\nlanguages.\nKover, however, has\ndone well to bring Djavadi\u2019s vivid prose to the\nEnglish language, which\nis studded with brilliant\nimagery, like a clove\nstudded orange: at the\nclinic an intern \u201ctosses a\nname into the damp, stuffy\nair of the waiting room\nand disappears\u201d, while her\nblue clothing \u201caccentuates\nmy olive skin and makes\nme look like an overripe\neggplant.\u201d\nStructurally, the novel\nhas a couple of issues.\nDjavadi spends so much\ntime describing previous\ngenerations of the Sadr\nfamily, that the present\nbecomes like a reverse\nblack hole: as we get\ncloser to it, things start\nto speed up. Kimi\u00e2\u2019s life\nafter the family\u2019s move\nto Paris seems truncated,\nwith vast swathes seemingly lost or looked over.\nSimilarly, towards the\nbeginning of the novel\nDjavadi establishes a\nseries of questions that\nneed to be answered by\nthe end of the book \u2013 they\nall are, but mostly right at\nthe end of the book, giving\nthe impression they were\nan afterthought.\nFor a debut novel,\nDisoriental is hugely im-pressive. It\u2019s a bold, imaginative piece of work, one\nthat \u2013 in its interrogation\nof what we mean by\nidentity and belonging \u2013\nleaves us enriched on the\nother side.\nProtests during the Iranian Revolution// Wikimedia\nBOOKS\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nEuropa Editions. 335 pp.\nDISORIENTAL\nby N\u00e9gar Djavadi\n\n"

Here\u2019s a quick guide of things to do and see in the city and beyond.\nGetting around\nC\nomparedtomany\nfamous cities in\nthe States, San\nFrancisco is relatively small, so you can\neasily get around by foot.\nHowever, to get a more\nauthentic experience you\nmight want to opt for cy-cling, which has become\nincreasingly popular in\nthe past few decades \u2013\nthere\u2019s even a Bike to\nWork Day in May! There\nare cycle lanes everywhere across the city,\nincluding the Golden Gate\nBridge. I found a deal to\nrent a bike for $13 for 24\nhours (helmet and lock\nincluded), and spent the\nday cycling to and across\nthe Bridge, exploring the\nSausalito city on the other\nside, and coming back just\nin time to catch the sunset\nover the ocean. Besides\nbeing fun and all, a day\nof cycling also proved to\nbe good cardio \u2013 the city\nis so hilly that I could\neasily skip all my leg days\nthat month (JK, I don\u2019t\nexercise).\nCity landmarks\nThe pride of the city \u2013\nthe Golden Gate Bridge \u2013\noffers mesmerising views\nof the Bay on one side and\nthe Pacific Ocean on the\nother, with many white\nyachts \u2018decorating\u2019 the\nblue waters. According\nto Google Maps, crossing\nthe bridge by foot takes\naround 30min (I wouldn\u2019t\nknow because I cycled, i.e.\nsat still on the bike while\nthe strong ocean wind was\npushing me forwards).\nThe east pavement is used\nexclusively by pedestri-ans, while cyclists have\naccess to both sides.\nAnother famous attraction is Lombard Street,\nthe so-called \u2018crookedest\nstreet in the world\u2019 that\nExploring San Francisco: the Golden City by the bay\nwinds down a steep hill\nin sharp turns, surrounded\nby patches of greenery\nand blossoms. You can\nalso check out Telegraph\nHill \u2013 filled with beautiful\nfauna, it overlooks the\nBay and is home to Coit\nTower.\nSan Francisco also\nhas the world\u2019s largest\nWestern Chinatown, more\npopular among tourists\nthan the Golden Gate\nBridge. Besides numerous\nfood and souvenir shops,\nbars, and restaurants, you\ncan enjoy the views of\ncolourful Chinese-style\nbuildings as well as\nawesome street art on\nevery corner. My personal\nfavourites were a wall\ndecorated with red envelopes and a huge mural\nrepresenting all Chinese\nZodiac signs.\nAnother interesting\nlandmark is the city hall,\nwhich reminded me a bit\nof St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. It\u2019s\nalso close to a neighbourhood containing Victorian\nhouses that have been\nbeautifully re-painted in\nvarious colours and are\nfamously known as the\n\u201cpainted ladies\u201d. I visited\nthe place late at night\nso I didn\u2019t get to fully\nappreciate the colours,\nand the park nearby felt\na bit dodgy, but I enjoyed\nthe breath-taking views of\nthe city skyline unfolding\nbehind the low-rise Victorian buildings.\nFinally, you can visit\nUnion Square, a busy and\nvibrant place with shops,\nrestaurants, and bars,\nwhere you can chill in the\nevening. And you simply\ncan\u2019t miss Fisherman\u2019s\nWharf, especially Pier\nThe world\u2019s crookedest street might not be so fun to drive on // Flickr\nEdita Pileckyte\nTravel Editor\nTRAVEL\n39 where you\u2019ll find sea\nlions (you\u2019ll immediately\nrecognise the distinctive\nnoise and smell) as well\nas cute souvenir shops and\ncafes.\nPaid attractions\nSan Francisco also\nprides itself on its cable\ncars, which had served\nas the main means of\npublic transport before\nbuses were introduced.\nThere are currently three\nlines left, and they are\nused by both tourists and\nlocal commuters. You can\nalso visit a free-of-charge\nmuseum of cable cars to\nlearn more about their\nhistory and importance.\nAnd of course don\u2019t\nforget to visit Alcatraz\n\u2013 the infamous former\nprison for world\u2019s most\ndangerous criminals,\nknown for being impossible to escape from. The\nguided tour (about $40)\nincludes a ferry ride from\nthe city to the Alcatraz\nIsland and back, and an\ninformative audio guide\nwith stops all over the\nprison.\nOutside the city\nIf you opt for cycling\nacross the Golden Gate\nBridge, you can visit\nSausalito city on the other\nside. It resembles Nice,\nFrance and is therefore\nsometimes called California\u2019s French Riviera. You\ncan also visit the Black\nSands Beach if you want\nto see and walk on some\nblack sand.\nIf you still have some\ntime left, you can go\nsouth to visit Stanford\nUniversity. The campus is\nlarger than any university\ncampuses I\u2019ve seen in the\nUK, it\u2019s almost a town\nof its own: they have\nshopping malls, a massive\nstadium and pools, a\nchurch, and more. The\nlawn in front of the main\nentrance is incomparable\nto our cute and tiny\nQueen\u2019s Lawn. It can take\na while to walk across the\ncampus, so students get\naround by cycling or by\none of the many shuttle\nbus lines. I happened to\nvisit on the UG arrival\nday which left me with\nall kinds of nostalgic feels\nas I reminisced about my\nfirst weeks at Imperial.\nFurther south, in\nMountain View, which is\na part of Silicon Valley,\nyou can find many famous\nhigh tech companies and\ntheir campuses, a future\nworkplace for some of us.\nI visited the Googleplex,\nwhere staff members cycle\nbetween buildings on\nbikes painted in Google\u2019s\ncolours. You can\u2019t get\ninside the buildings as a\nvisitor unless you know\nanyone who works there\nbut you can enjoy a walk\noutside where you\u2019ll see\nmany Google-themed\nobjects, including lifesize Android statues.\nHowever, I would suggest\ngoing there only if you\nreally have nothing else to\ndo as it\u2019s not as interesting\nas other sights.\nOne of my favourite shots of sunny San Francisco // Edita Pileckyte\n\u201cTo visit one of\nthose secluded\nbeaches\nthat you see\nonline, you\nwill need a bit\nof planning:\nmost of them\nare not easy\n(or cheap) to\nreach\u201d\nSunset in Santorini: you can\u2019t put a price on a view like that! // Pexels\nWith the approaching summer break, Travel Writer Elina Michaelidou shares her best tips for visiting the tourist-beloved Greek Islands without splurging too much.\nTop tips for visiting the Greek Islands on a budget\nElina Michaelidou\nTravel Writer\nTRAVEL\nD\nreaming of\nvisiting the\nGreek Islands\nbut don\u2019t have\nall you need to enjoy\nan Instagram-perfect\ntrip (i.e. money)? Don\u2019t\nworry, you can still take\nyour memorable shots\nand experience Greece to\nits maximum while travelling on a budget if you\nfollow the following tips.\nTravel off-peak\nOr at least avoid July\nand August! Prices in\nSeptember and October\ntend to drop, both for\nflight tickets and hotels.\nThe beach is great that\ntime of year, and you get\nto avoid the extreme heat\nof summer (it can easily\nget above 30o\nC at noon).\nHowever, keep in mind\nthat (early) September is\nalso quite hot.\nAvoid Mykonos &\nSantorini\nAlthough there are\nmany direct flights to\nthese islands, which\nmakes them more easily\naccessible, accommodation is rather expensive\nthere. If you still wish to\nvisit them for those magnificent sunsets or their\nclear blue beaches, opt\nfor a nearby island. The\nclosest (inhabited) island\nto Mykonos is Tinos.\nNaxos and Siros are also\nnearby. For Santorini,\nlook for accommodation\nin Ios or Folegandros.\nYou can then day-trip to\nMykonos or Santorini!\nCheck the ferry type\nHigh-speed ferries are\nusually more expensive\nand may require an\nadvance booking. Most\nferries also accept cars for\nextra cost, unless they are\ngoing to a car-free island,\nlike Hydra and Kastellorizo. On a side note: choose\na seat inside the ferry\nif it\u2019s air-conditioned!\nMost ferries have both\nan indoor and an outdoor\nsitting area. Personally,\nI would go for an indoor\nseat to avoid the summer\nheat, especially at noon\n(in general, it is advisable\nto avoid being outside\nbetween 11am and 4pm),\nand spontaneously go out\nto take pictures and get\nsome fresh air. If you sit\noutside, bring a hat and\nlots of sun cream!\nRent a car, not a boat\nIf you want to visit\none of those secluded\nbeaches that you see\nonline, then you will need\na bit of planning. Most\nof them are not easy (or\ncheap) to reach. Some of\nthem require a two-to-three-hour drive from the\nclosest city (best case), or\nthey are only accessible\nby boat. Renting a car is\nclearly not as expensive as\nrenting a boat, so opt for a\nbeach that is accessible by\nroad and make sure you\nknow the way there.\nAvoid paid beaches\nRenting umbrellas and\nsunbeds can be quite expensive on their own. You\ncan simply cut costs by\ngoing to a beach with free\nentry. Even better, bring\nyour own umbrella and a\nfolding chair. Don\u2019t forget\nto pack your own snacks\ntoo and remember to clean\nyour space afterwards.\nAvoid overpriced\nmeals\nMain meals in restaurants usually should\nbe around \u20ac10-15 each.\nStreet food like souvlaki\nor gyros (meat in pita\nbread or wrap) costs\neven less. Also, be sure\nto check the total price\nbefore ordering fresh fish\nin restaurants \u2013 in many\ncases, the price is calculated by weight and type\nof fish (you may also be\nable to choose which fish\nyou want to eat). Before\nordering, ask for the\ntotal price if not shown.\nFinally, when travelling\nby ferry, you can bring\nyour own snacks on board\n\u2013 even though most ferries\nhave bars with food and\ndrinks, they are usually\noverpriced.\nEnjoy the Greek hos-pitality!\nThe last tip is not\nrelated to money, but\nrather to the basis of your\ntrip. Wander around the\npicturesque streets, taste\nthe Greek cuisine and\nthe authentic ingredients\nused, talk to the locals,\nand take a donkey ride .\nFun fact: If you visited\n3 different Greek islands\nand islets (both inhabited\nand not) every day, you\nwould need more than\n5 years to visit them all.\nvisitgreece.gr reports that\nthe total number of Greek\nislands and islets is 6,000!\nGorgeous (yet expensive) Mykonos island // Pexels\n\n"

Imperial\u2019s\ngold rating (awarded in\nJune 2017) still stands,\nthough it may not be\ndirectly comparable\nwith institutions that received gold in the 2018\nassessment.\nFollowing feedback\nfrom year two partici-pants, the Department for\nEducation made a series\nof \u201crefinements\u201d to TEF\n(which now stands for\nthe Teaching Excellence\nand Student Outcomes\nFramework). There are\nnow six main metrics\n(drawn from the National\nStudent Survey, numbers\nof students completing\ntheir course, and numbers\nof students in employment or education six\nmonths post-graduation)\nwhich are intended to test\nteaching quality, learning\nenvironment, and learning\ngain. Weighting of each\nmetric has also been\nchanged: each of the three\nNSS-based metrics has\na weighting of 0.5 while\nthe three non-NSS-based\nmetrics are weighted as\n1.0.\nA flag system has\nalso been introduced to\nindicate providers who\nare significantly above\nor below the TEF benchmarks for each metric\nand is used to form an\n\u201cinitial hypothesis\u201d. For\neach metric a provider\nmay receive zero, one or\ntwo positive or negative\nflags. Providers with\npositive flags totalling at\nleast 2.5 (according to the\nnew weighting system)\nand no negative flags are\ninitially considered gold.\nInstitutes with negative\nflags amounting to 1.5 or\nmore are to be considered\nbronze, regardless of any\npositive flags they may\nhave received.

In\ntheory, the GDPR only\napplies the data of EU\ncitizens. However, the\nglobal nature of internet\nservices means nearly\nevery online service is\naffected, and the regulation has resulted in\nsignificant changes for\nusers all over the world\nas companies globally\nscramble to adapt.\nMuch of the GDPR\nbuilds upon rules set\nby earlier EU privacy\nmeasures such as the Data\nProtection Directive and\nPrivacy Shield, but there\nare some crucial aspects\nof the GDPR that warrant\na closer look.\nFirstly, the GDPR sets a\nhigher bar for companies\nto obtain personal data\nthan we\u2019ve ever seen on\nthe internet before. For\nany instance where a\ncompany collects personal\ndata on an EU citizen,\nit will by default need\nexplicit and informed\nconsent from that person.\nThe GDPR also enforces\nthat users have \u201cthe right\nto be forgotten\u201d. In other\nwords, users need to be\ngiven a way to revoke that\nsame consent.\nUsers should also be\nable to request all the data\na company has on them\nas a way to verify that\nconsent. This concept has\nbeen present in previous\niterations of privacy reg-ulations, but the GDPR\nensures companies give\nindividuals access to the\ninformation that organisations hold about them\nfree of charge. Prior to the\nGDPR, there was a \u00a310\nfee for a Subject Access\nRequest, which businesses and public bodies can\ncharge in order to release\nany personal information.\nHowever, the GDPR\nmeans this fee will be\nscrapped, and requests for\npersonal information can\nbe made free-of-charge\nand must be released\nwithin one month.\nThese changes make\nthe GDPR a significant\nimprovement on existing\nrequirements, and it explicitly extends to companies based outside the EU.\nThe tech industry\nhas, especially in recent\nyears, become used to\n(and highly dependent\non) collecting and sharing\ndata with little to no\nrestriction. Furthermore,\nthat freedom has been the\nprimary business model\nof several companies.\nThe GDPR gives users\nmore control over their\ndata, and also pushes for\ninnovation in the way\nthat online advertising is\ncurrently targeted.\nFor companies that\nhave for far too long\noperated under the rather\nirresponsible principle of\n\u2018extract as much data as\npossible and figure it out\nlater,\u2019 reorganising under\nGDPR will be a pain. Part\nof the problem is how\ncompanies\u2019 data solutions\nare set up, and a portion of\nit is that \u2018personal information\u2019 is a wishy-washy\ncategory. Names, email\naddress, phone numbers,\nlocation data \u2013 those are\nthe obvious ones. But then\nthere\u2019s more ambiguous\ndata, like \u2018an oblique ref-erence, like the tall bald\nguy who lives on East 18th\nStreet.\u2019 Such data would\nbe hard to organise, and\nthat makes GDPR-enforced Subject Access\nRequests particularly\ndifficult to handle.\nTo be fair, GDPR as\na whole is a bit more\ncomplicated than what\nI\u2019ve illustrated above.\nAlison Cool, a professor\nof anthropology and\ninformation science at the\nUniversity of Colorado,\nBoulder,writesinTheNew\nYork Times that the law is\n\u201cstaggeringly complex\u201d\nand practically incomprehensible to the people\nwho are trying to comply\nwith it. Several scientists\nand data managers she\nspoke to \u201cdoubted that\nabsolute compliance was\neven possible.\u201d\nAt the end of the day,\nthe effectiveness of\nGDPR will only be seen\nas time passes and will\ndepend quite heavily on\nhow strictly it is enforced.\nBut users like you and\nme can take steps to be\nmore aware of the rights\nthat we have over the data\nthat we so readily hand\nover to companies. For\nstarters, go take a look\nat your Instagram app\u2019s\nsettings page. It looks\nvastly different to how it\na few months ago \u2013 and\nthat\u2019s partly attributed to\nthe GDPR.\nI\u2019ve received more than 17 emails from the services with that exact subject. And I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s inbox\nhas been flooded \u2013 here\u2019s why.\nGDPR might have been cluttering up your inbox in the last few weeks // CC\n\n"

However,\nseldom does one hear he\nwas a man of science \u2013 let\nalone an early science\ncommunicator! Indeed,\nGeorge Henry Lewes, a\nprominent writer, critic,\nand amateur physiologist\nof the Victorian era\ndeclared Dickens was\n\u201ccompletely outside phi-losophy, science, and the\nhigher literatures\u201d following a look at his library.\nUnbeknownst to many\nus, however, Dickens\nwas indeed an individual\nheavily influenced by\nscience, with much of\nhis work being inspired\nby a variety of scientific\naspects, from the human\nbody to the Earth itself.\nDickens was at the\ncentre of Victorian\nsociety, with a devoted\naudience taking his word\nas gospel, from his novels\nto the magazines he published and edited. Consequently, his fame put\nhim in touch with several\nnotable scientists of his\nday and age including\nCharles Darwin, chemist\nJane Marcet, botanist Jane\nLoudon, and Michael\nFaraday, to name a few.\nFurthermore, his work\nwas admired by the likes\nof Florence Nightingale,\nwho would even prescribe\nhis novels as treatment to\nthe soldiers she nursed.\nDickens\u2019 lifetime saw\na number of key scientific\nbreakthroughs, which\nlay the foundations for\nmodern science, such as\nthe acceptance of the age\nof the earth, the theory of\nevolution, and the second\nlaw of thermodynamics.\nDickens himself felt so\ndeeply about these issues\nthat he campaigned for\nvarious scientific theories,\nas well as publicly criticising other aspects of\nscience. Unfortunately,\nlittle is spoken today\nabout how Dickens has\nhelped shape scientific\nunderstanding, and how\nhe tried to solve social\nproblems through inspiring his audience with his\nbooks. Unbeknownst to\nus, Charles Dickens is\nindeed a man of science,\nand should be recognised\nfor his contributions to the\nmodern era.\n\u201cDickens is a\nman of science,\nand should\nbe recognised\nfor his\ncontributions\nto the time\u201d \u201cDickens\ncampaigned\nfor a science\neveryone\ncould do or be\ninvolved in\u201d\nLast month, the Charles\nDickens Museum opened\na new exhibition to try\nand address this lack of\nunderstanding \u2013 Charles\nDickens: Man of Science\nlooks at his work to try\nand show he was a key\nscience communicator of\nthe age. Speaking to Felix,\nGuest Curator Dr Adelene\nBuckland, senior lecturer\nin nineteenth-century literature at King\u2019s College\nLondon, said that they\nbelieve this was the first\nexhibition of its kind to\nfocus on Dicken\u2019s interest\nin science. Dr Buckland\nsaid: \u201cDickens was a\nfamous writer, but his\npowers of observation and\nhis connections as one of\nthe most famous men in\nBritain at the time meant\nthat he was also a leading\ncommunicator of science.\nHe communicated science\nthrough his journals and\nmagazines, and campaigned on it, on behalf of\nlots of his friends.\u201d\nDr Buckland was also\nclear about the importance\nof Dickens\u2019role in shaping\npublic understanding of\nscience: \u201cDickens is a\nwould associate with\nscience, as he did not have\na background in science\nor scientific training, and\nwas mainly associated\nwith the arts. He campaigned for a science that\neveryone could do, or be\ninvolved in and participate in \u2013 a science that is\nexciting and enlivening.\nHe was a pioneer of that\nidea that science matters\nmost when it reaches\nmore people!\u201d\nHere at Imperial, a lot\nof great research is going\non. However, much of\nthe time it is confined\nto scientific journals. If\nyou want your research\nto reach the masses, then\ntake inspiration from\nDickens: look for science\ncommunication events,\nteam up with someone\nwho has an interest in\nthe arts, or try something\nunusual to grab people\u2019s\nattention!\nCharles Dickens:\nMan of Science is on\nat the Charles Dickens\nMuseum (closest tube:\nRussell Square) until\n11th November 2018.\nTickets for museum and\nexhibition: \u00a39.50 adults;\n\u00a37.50 concessions; \u00a34.50\nchildren; free for <6s.\nThe Charles Dickens Museum is currently exploring how he was a science communicator // Wikimedia\ngreat example of a science\ncommunicator; however,\nhe is not someone we\nSCIENCE\nSteve Allain\nScience Writer\nO\nne of the more\ns u r p r i s i n g\ni n v a s i v e\nspecies, now\nfound across the world\nthanks to mankind, is the\ndomestic cat! Whether\nthese moggies are pets\nleft to roam free, or have\nestablished themselves\nas feral population, both\ncause unimaginable\ndamage to various species around the globe.\nDomestic cats have no\nnative range, and they\nare listed among the 100\nworst non-native invasive species in the world,\nby the International\nUnion for Conservation\nof Nature (IUCN). In\n2013, a study conducted\nin the US estimated that\ndomestic cats, both owned\nand feral, killed between\n1.3\u20134.0 billion birds and\n6.3\u201322.3 billion mammals\neach year. As well as the\ndirect effects of hunting,\ncats can act as vectors\nfor multiple diseases,\nincluding those that can\nbe spread to humans such\nas rabies.\nThe domestic cat is, of\ncourse, a beloved pet, but\nmost people seem to be\noblivious to the ecological\ndamage their cat has the\npotential to inflict. These\neffects are more notably\nseen on islands, with\nstatistics recorded by the\nIUCN Red List indicating\nthat cats have caused or\nbeen implemented in the\nextinctions of 33 modern\nbirds, mammals, and\nreptiles. Here in the UK,\nthe very rare and endemic\nScottish wild cat is at risk\nof imminent extinction\ndue to hybridisation from\nferal cats, and the transmission of disease. There\nhave been isolated incidents around the world\nof single cats killing large\namounts of wildlife, such\nas a case from Ohakune,\nNew Zealand where in a\nweek one cat killed a total\nof 102 bats. This is based\npurely on the number of\nbats that were found dead;\nwe all know cats like to\nplay with their food, thus\nthe real number is likely\nmuch higher.\nAll of this has sounded\npretty negative so far, but\nI am not against owning\ncats, nor do I hate them.\nI think now is the time\nto step up and to become\nresponsible for the actions\nof our pets in order to\nprevent further damage to\nthe ecosystems into which\nwe have transplanted\nthem.\nThe main reason they\nare such a threat is that the\nanimals that they hunt are\nnot used to predators (es-pecially on islands); and\nso, cats can unfortunately\nlead to their extinction. I\nam sure if you own a cat,\nit may have once bought\nyou unwanted gifts in\nthe past \u2013 in the form of\ndead mice or birds. If you\nwant to help prevent local\nwildlife in your neck of\nthe woods from declining,\ntry to keep your cats in\ndoors and neuter/spay\nthem. Cats are prolific\nbreeders, with feral populations quickly growing\ndue to their young age\nof sexual maturity and\nthe large numbers of\nlitter a cat can have\neach year. So next time\nTigger is out playing in\nthe garden, just think of\nthe unseen damage that\nyour beloved pet may\nactually be responsible\nfor.\nOr a cat person? // Wikimedia\nConnect with Conservation: cat-astrophe\nPuppy science: Why they are so cute?\nI\ndon\u2019t know about all\nof you reading this,\nbut I am crazy about\npuppies! However,\nhave you ever wondered\nwhy they look so incredibly adorable, especially at\na young age?\nAccording to a recent\ncollaborative study\nbetween the US and the\nNetherlands, puppies\nhave evolved to be cute\nbecause their life depends\non it. Unlike their wolf\nancestors, the mothers\nof these puppies usually\nleave them when they are\nsix to eleven weeks old,\ndepending on the breed\nand whether they live in\nthe wild or in captivity. It\nmeans that puppies will\nnot receive support from\ntheir parents following\nthis weaning period. This\nlack of nursing can result\nin a shortage of food,\nand in some cases death.\nTherefore, it would be\nlogical to deduce that\nyoung dogs who are more\nattractive during this\nweaning period would be\nloved by us humans and\ntherefore have a better\nchance to be adopted,\nincreasing their chances\nof survival.\nMore importantly, the\ngroup suggests this \u2018peak\u2019\nof adorability is around\nthe time of weaning,\nbecause younger puppies\nare actually dependent on\ntheir parents; therefore,\nbeing very attractive prior\nto that age does not make\nevolutionary sense.\nSCIENCE\nSarah Wong\nScience Writer\nattractive they were.\nThe three breeds shown\nwere Jack Russell Terrier,\nCane Corso, and White\nShepherd. Since Cane\nCorso is a large breed,\noften used as guard dogs,\nit is not surprising that it\nis perceived as comparatively less attractive. Nevertheless, all puppies were\nrated as most attractive\nprior to ten weeks across\nall three breeds. Additionally, the puppies were\nreported as having a very\nlow attractiveness rating\naround the one-week\nmark. Consequently, this\nsupported their hypothesis\nof puppies being perceived as more adorable\nto humans around the\nweaning period.\nTo study the hu-man-dog bond, the paper\nsuggested they could\nscreen videos instead of\nstill photos, in order to\nstudy how the movement\nof dogs affected our\nperception of the puppies.\nWhile the experiment is\noverwhelmingly cute, we\ncan also learn some psychological information,\nsince baby-like facial\ntraits in humans are also\nperceived as more likable.\nFor example, if you have a\n\u2018baby-face\u2019, with a larger\nforehead and a smaller\njaw, you are probably\nperceived as more attrac-tive. This phenomenon,\ncoined \u2018Kindchenschema\neffect\u2019, is proposed to\nensure adults care for\ntheir young\u2019uns, so babies\nsurvive.\nSo next time you see a\npuppy, think how Mother\nNature is manipulating\nus to love them, and then\ngo pet them! If you have\na baby face, be grateful as\nyou are perceived as more\nattractive! If you do not\nhowever, it is also fine as\nyou have already grown\nup and your parents love\nyou anyway.\nAre you a dog person? // Wikimedia\n\u201cPuppies have\nevolved to be\ncute because\ntheir lives\ndepend on it\u201d\nTo test their hypothesis,\nthey showed pictures\nof \u2018cute\u2019 puppies to 51\npeople in a form of beauty\ncontest! Adult humans\nwere shown pictures of\ndogs differing in their\nbreed and age, before\nbeing asked to rate how\n\n"
