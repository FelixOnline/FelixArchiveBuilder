    "content": "vs Bristol: wen 2-0\nvs Exeter: drew 1-1\nvs City: l sts won 2-0, 2nds won 2-0\nTwo weeks ago the sailing team travelled to\nthe West Country to take on teams from\nBristol and Exeter at Starcross Yacht Club,\nDevon.\nImperial sailed Bristol first in very light\nconditions. Led by their skipper, Jones, the\nteam took command of the first race from the\nstart and finished with a convincing 1, 3,4. In\nthe second race, Imperial set off on the right\nfoot giving a green to the opposition on the\nstarting gun. Unfortunately Bristol recovered\nbest from the melee at the start and at the first\nmark were 1st,2 nd and 3rd. Jones, obviously\nassisted by his thermal underwear, realised\nthe de spa ration of the Situation and casually\nroll-tacked through the entire Bristol fleet.\nOn seeing this the Bristol team gave up and by\nthe finish had allowed the other two Imperial\nboats to sail through to 3rd and 5th. The match against Exeter was less dramatic\nwith Imperial securing a strong 2, 3, 4 in the\nfirst race. In the second, the speed of the\nsupposedly slower alternative helms from\nExeter caught Imperial off guard and they\ndropped a race to the home team.\nOn the Sunday, Kennedy notched up a further three capsizes in the club race to take\nhis total this term to seven.\nLast weekend Imperial took two teams to\nQueen Mary SC to sail City University. City\nconceded even before the first race, and after\nthe formality of sailing around the course in\nfront of them had taken place, Imperial raced\namongst themselves for the rest of the\nafternoon. Many thanks to Brunei University\nfor lending City a rudder and tiller at such\nshort notice so that the match could take\nplace.\nCastaways Cup (the London College's sailing championship) is being held this\nweekend at the Welsh Harp, where Imperial\nare entering two teams. Any supporters will\nbe most welcome.\nAstrix and the ferret\nFoot bai' \u2022 *\nThis year'sICA FC annual dinner will be held\non Tuesday 13 March in the trophy room at\nChelsea FC, Stanford Bridge. Subsidised\nprice will be \u00a39.50, including three course\nroast beef dinner, silver service, etc. There\nwill be a bar extension until 1:00am. Guest\nspeaker to be arranged. Cheques made\npayable to ICU ACC should be given to team\ncaptains before Wednesday 7 March.\nTo give us a better idea of numbers could\nyou please add your name to the list if you\nintend coming to the dinner. Anybody\nwishing to go on the tour to Gloucester on the\nweekend 23-25 March please sign the list on\nthe noticeboard, as soon as possible.\nPage 10W Kk WB WW MBS MMM WWW BBB WW M On Sunday the Orienteering Club attended a classy event in Aldershot. The event had\nattracted many of the South's top oriente ers, so the standard of competition was high.\nThe terrain, a military training area, was of\nmixed rough open land and woodland. As\nexpected trenches, pits and earth banks were\nin abundance to provide an interestingly\ndetailed map.\nMost of the men ran the premier course,\nwith impressive overall results. The planner\nhad provided 11.6km of mentally challenging\nnavigation, covering the most physically\ndemanding terrain. An added twist was a bushfire at one of the controls to be visited!\nSeveral of the club's novices successfully\ncompleted Wayfarers courses\u2014less demanding but still containing the essence of\norienteering; challenging navigation under\ncompetition conditions.\nWatch out for the red, white and blue of the\nOrienteering Club as a guest team at the Hyde\nPark Relay tomorrow!\nPunchdrunk\nWater skiing The thing to remember, we found out this\nweek, is that the important bits are the\nextremities. Keep those warm and the\nproblem is cracked. By this week we hope to\nhave arranged a discount on wetsuit socks\nand gloves, and there should be enough\naround for new members to borrow. When\nyou're all to g ged up, it's warm\u2014honest!After tense negotiations with Moscow,\nWashington, oh, and ICU too, we've got the\nprice of skiing down from \u00a34.00 to \u00a32.90. Not\nonly that, but the boat has been fitted with a training bar that almost guarantees that\nbeginners get up first go.\nIf you don't believe that warmth is possible\nat this time of year in the water, or- that ten\nminutes behind a240 bhp boat isn't tiring,\nallow us to convince you otherwise. Even if\nyou'd just like to get up first time or are into\nkinky rubber wetsuits, we can help!\nYou can arrange to come water skiing on\nWednesday by finding us above Southside\nBar on Monday at 12:45pm. IC Hockey 2nd XI IC 2nd XI hockey team sailed into the second\ndivision of the Middlesex League on\nSaturday. A crushing 6-0 victory for the home\nside ensured the team has an opportunity to\nenjoy a different standard of hockey next\nseason.\nDespite fielding an under strength side,\npositive play and accurate passing, allowed a two goal lead at half time. After the interval,\nconcerted pressure led to three goals in as\nFriday, February 24, 1984 JHHI\nmany minutes and an excellent goal from the\nleft wing put the icing on the cake.\nSpecial mention should be made of centre\nr Boat Henlev Fours Head\nHenley Fours Head of River proved to be a happy hunting ground for IC crews again in\n1984. Having won three events there in 1983\nthe College crews picked up the tankards for\nthree out of the five events entered.\nThe Senior Squad entered an elite cox ed four as its first boat. This performed a long\nway below potential and striking a labour ed30 strokes per minute over the 2'/4 mile\ncourse, took 11.31. It lost the section by 1\nsecond and came fifth overall.\nThe senior A cox less four, hastily put\ntogether towards the end of last week,\nperformed well to win their section. With\ndynamic stroke man Greg Harding striking a steady 32spm the four took 11.33 coming in\nsixth overall.\nThe Senior B cox less four won their section\nby a convincing ten second margin, despite\nKevin Steinlechner steering the boat into the\nbank near the finish.\nThe novice also won their section by one\nsecond, whilst the women's novice four came\nfifth in their event, rowing well below their\nbest.\nIn another action-packed week down at the\nrange, Guilds came second closely behind\nRCS in the inter-CCU pistol competition.\nDespite heroic performances by Messrs\nBowser (club captain, contact via Elec Eng\nletter-racks), Harrison, Stewart, Williams\nand Ashford, the massive skill of Miss\nHollows, assisted by Constantinople, Huggs,\nFudge, and Marvin (the Android) Baguettes\nproved slightly too much. In an exclusive\ninterview with the Rifle Club edit io rial board,\nGluids captain Steve Harrison commented\n'Sick as a paw rot, Briain.'\nEd Asford and Gareth Fones were selected\nto shoot for the London Counties Junior\nTeam by accident, and demonstrated their\nremarkable skills by shooting well below their\ncapabilities. However this is clearly another\nstep up the ladder to an international\nshooting career.\nAs promised in our FELIJC article some\nweeks ago, the 'Down the Dogs' evening has\nnow been fully planned by our ents\ncommittee, and is scheduled for Thursday 1\nMarch. Meet at the range at 6:30pm. The prone rifle handicap competition is\nnow reaching a climactic conclusion after\nclub hotshots Fuggs and Bowser were\nknocked out in the semi-final. Harrison and\nBaguettes now meet in the final in what will\nbe a hard fought match of nerves for these\nwimps. Steve is already in training for this\nevent (or is it something else you're training\nfor?)\nBH n nH nnnn i FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "LettersWM\nLock Again\nDear Pallab\nWith reference to my letter of\ntwo weeks ago and the subsequent replies, I believe the public\nnature of my criticisms of Simon\nBanton were justified since as an\nR CSU official he holds a public\nposition and since his letter\nappeared in London Student it\nwas a public event.\nSimon was not actually being\nmis-represented and if the article\nwas full of mistakes a letter\ncomplaining at the abundance of\nmistakes would have made more\nsense to the readers than one\nsimply listing the errors.\nI think the letter was an\nexample of what has often struck\nme about the mascot e ers \u2014that\nis, that they take the whole\nbusiness much too seriously.\nThey begin to think that details,\nlike the consistency of Mary,\nactually matter and forget to\ntreat the whole thing as a joke\u2014it\nis this mentality which smacks of\nmindlessness (like football hooligans who forget that it is just a game). I have no objection to\nmascot ry in principle, as a combination of fun and money-raising for charity. Incidentally, I hope all IC students will have as\nmuch time for charities when\nthey are earning large salaries\nand also will give politics the\nattention it deserves as they\nbecome rather influential members of society.\nAs a member of Ents and\nentertainments organiser in my\nhall of residence, I am fairly well\nac qui anted with the problems of\nlaying on events in Imperial. As\nfor being rejected by my peers, I am not aware that this is the case.\nActually, I get the impression\nRCSU has been rejected by most\nof my peers. I don't think that\nthis is a happy situation but I think the explanation that this is\ndown purely to the apathy of\nRCS students, while leaving\nRCSU conveniently blameless, is\nincorrect. They have been positively turned off by what they\nhave seen by RCSU.\nI went to the first RCS U GM and discovered it was primarily a dart throwing event\u2014spontaneous lunacy is funny, but\norganised lunacy is a bore, and so\nare its participants. As for\nBroadsheet, I read through the\nfirst two editions of in-jokes\nbefore giving up\u2014it just wasn't worth the effort to read through\nit.\nHowever, I will admit that\nSimon may well be as much an\nPage 2 \u2022 HH BH1 \u2022 Let teM' to the Editor' n lu\n\u2022 Letter5 t of he Ey^ oi> obnoxious hack as I am an\n'apathetic non-entity', although I wasn't the only one around him\nwho cringed as he discovered his\nletter in London Student.\nYours sincerely\nDave 'Bullshit' Lock\nPhysics 1\nBroadsheet\nConspiracy\nDear Pallab\nJust a note to everybody who\nread last Monday's edition of\nBroadsheet and might be wondering why I did not submit a manifesto for RCSU President.\nI have never at any time\nreceived notification of anything\nto do with manifestos. I have\nnever even been told that I was\nable to submit one, let alone told\nthe closing date. On Sunday\nevening (the papers came down\nthe previous Friday) I went to the\nRCSU Office to ask about this\nand was told that Broadsheet had\nalready been printed and I was\ntoo late. Most of the R CSU officers present found it difficult\nto hide their smirks.\nConsidering that RCSU's frequent answer to criticism is 'get\ninvolved and change things' I find it incredible that they make it\nso difficult for 'outsiders' to do\njust that.\nMy manifesto has been distributed separately for anyone who\nis interested.\nYours\nAnn Collins\nCandidate for RCSU President\nDear Sir\nI would like to take this\nopportunity to explain my apparent indifference and apathy concerning my proposal of Ann\nCollins for R CSU President.\nThe reason that I didn't submit\na proposal manifesto for this\nweek's Broadsheet is that it was\nnever mentioned to me, neither\nwritten nor verbally. When I made enquiries about it last\nMonday morning I was told that\nit had been mentioned in the\n'What's On' section in last week's edition of FELIX. As I was away\nfor the entire weekend, not\nreturning until afer the copy\ndeadline on Sunday evening, I was unable to submit an article.\nAnyone who has missed the\nHustings (held yesterday), please\nsee Ann or myself for any\nquestions concerning her mani-fes to. Yours\nLee Evans\nPS: Whoever writes the Broadsheet 'Vicious Rumours' department may like to apply for a post\nas a reporter with London\nStudent: Ann lived in FalmouthKeogh last year and has never\nbeen out with Karl Schmidt!\nAnn Collins\nConspiracy\nDear Pallab\nAs a point of information, I should like to explain that all\ncandidates for the RCSU elections were notified personally of\nthe copy deadline for the manifestos edition of Broadsheet.\nIn addition to this, it was\nprinted in 'What's On' in last\nweek's FELIX( no 667) that all\nmanifestos had to be submitted,\nat the latest on Saturday 18 Feb.\nIt seems to me that any serious\ncandidate would have made the\neffort to find this out well in\nadvance instead of leaving it too\nlate and then whining about a supposed conspiracy.\nYours sincerely\nlan Thomas\nThe Letter\nCollege\nWouldn't Publish\nDear Pallab\nEnclosed is a letter to all the\nstaff of Imperial that administration thought unfit to publish in the\nGazette.\nWould you do us the service of\npublishing it in FELIX. Show\nFIDO that you do provide news\nand comments in a responsible and\nobjective manner.\nThe College's budget for wages\nand salaries is a fixed amount.\nAny additional money requested\nby us can only be met by reducing\nthe money available for claims\nmade by ASTEMS, AUT and\nNAL GO. Therefore we arc asking you if N UP E could have the\n\u2022 first bite of the cake.\nIn the past, we have been I he-last section of employees to settle\nour wage claims. We have been\nunable to negotiate from a position of strength because only\nthe crumbs of the cake were\nleft\u2014and what was left was\nsimply too small an amount to\nsupport our 469 workers.\nSince our wages are so low,\nmembers of N UP E have left\nCollege employment, or would\nnot fill vacant posts leaving 385\nof us (as at 1/7/83) to do their\nduties as well as our own. The\nresult has been prowlers on the\nCollege premises, loss of personal\nbelongings and disagreements\nover duties. If you help us now,\nwe in turn would be more alert,\ncaring and able to help you when\nyou needed our support.\nIn the financial year 1982/3,\nthe total cost of staff (1,713) in\nA STEMS, AUT and NAL GO was \u00a325,097,562 (\u00a314,651.23 per\nhead). In the same period the cost\nof the Cleaning, Manual and\nAnciallary workers (385) was\n\u00a32,120,856 (\u00a35,508.71 per head).\nFor this money our members had\nto work long, arduous hours\nthroughout the whole seven days\nand nights of the week.\nThis year more than any other,\nN UP E is fighting for a substantial increase in pay as a measure\ntowards the abolition of low pay\nand the establishment of a basic\nrate equivalent to two-thirds the\nnational average, currently\n\u00a399.47 per week (source NES\nApril 1983, updated by index of.\naverage earnings October 1983,\npublished 14 December 1983).\nWould you please respond to\nour call by inundating Mr Mellor\n(Asst Personnel Secretary), Sherfield Building, with your support\nfor our cause. EA Wheeler\n\\ Friday, February 24, 19841\nNUPE Branch Treasurer\nThanks!\nDear Pallab\nThis is just a short note from\nthe SF Soc committee thanking\nyou for the help you and FELIX gave our society during the\norganisation of our Picocon\nevent. It was a great help to us\nand the con wouldn't have\nworked without it. The event was\na great success overall and people\nenjoyed themselves.

Any Other Business.\nPresident's Report\n1. UGC Response\nAt the end of last term a small group of Union Officers discussed the\nissues of the UGC letter concerning the financial restrictions that\nare likely to be imposed on institutions of higher education. Over\nthe Christmas period both Peter Burt, External Affairs Officer, and\nI drafted separate responses based on the discussion. We found it\ndifficult to combine the two replies although both agreed on essential\nissues, they expressed these views differently. As such both responses\nwere submitted to College. We are expected to reply to the College\ndraft later this month. Professor A. Swanson, Pro-Rector, will be\noutlining the College's response on March 6th, at a meeting which\neveryone is welcome to attend.\n2. \u00a34,000\nAt the end of last term I discussed with the College Secretary the\npossibility of College financing the installation of showers in the\nVolleyball Court area. John Smith agreed that College would finance\nthis project to the degree of \u00a34,000.\n3. Southside Disco\nAfter various communications with regard to the noise level on a Friday night and College concern for neighbours, I met with various\nCollege representatives to discuss the issue. After a lengthy discussion\nthey agreed that there was no cause for concern at present. However, if different, i.e. noisier, events were held in the area,certain provisions\nwould have to be made. College accepted the responsibility of improving\nthe sound proofing of the area.\n4. Suggestions and Complaints\nI was asked by College to chair this sub-committee for the remainder\nof my term of office. Although an extra College commitment, I feel this\n.can only benefit the Union as,in theory,we now have an increased ability\nto attempt to convince College of the numerous improvements necessary in\nthe refectory system - an immense task when dealing with the present\npeople and circumstances. Please make your views of the food known to me.\nPRESIDENT'S REPORT\nThe appearance of a new magazine earlier this term started a debate\nwithin ICU. The magazine was produced by members of the College administration without my knowledge. Throughout last term the sabbaticals were\napproached on several occasions about the editorial style of Felix. We consistently maintained that editorial freedom was an established right\nfor Felix within IC Union and that we were not prepared to attempt to curb,\nthat freedom. At the beginning of session several queries were received\nin the Union Office from members of the College administration about the I running of Felix. Expecting some sort of problem from College we began\nto consider the implications if College persisted. We were not expecting\nto see the publication of a rival.\nI discussed with the Rector why this magazine had been published. There\nappeared to be two primary reasons:\n(i) It was to be used to increase communication between College staff. \u00bb\n(ii) College felt that as the sabbaticals were unwilling to attempt to\nchange the style of Felix, then they had to produce a magazine\nmaking their dissatisfaction known.\nThis issue has been discussed at length in Council with Pallab present.\nThere is no indication at present whether any further issues of Fido will\nbe produced. Several members of College have commented on the improved\nattitude in recent issues of Felix. (Soon fix that-Feiix-Ed)\nCollege Dinners\nI discussed this issue with the College Secretary - we established\nthat the price of College Dinners for students was too high to be\nconsider ec\" as sub sidi sed and as such agreed that the student rate\nwould now be \u00a35. It was also decided that certain dinners warrant\na bar extension and a jazz or swing band. The first of these Dinner\nand Dances will be in Hay at \u00a310 a double ticket'.\nStudent Residence Policy .\nI was asked at fairly short notice to reply to the College response\nto the Lauwerys Report on the Management of Student Residence. The\nCollege policy document was at the third draft stage when I was first\nasked for the Union's comments. There were a number of points I was\nunhappy with in the document. It advocates the appointment of the\nManaging Surveyor for Residences, whose salary would be a direct cost\nto the Residence account, as would the wages of the present messenger\nand security personnel. This increased cost is hoped to be offset by\nan increase in the Vacation Lettings income - however, the implications\nof further costs being attributed to the Residence account could have a severe effect on student rents in the future.\nI have questioned these points and others, including academic staff\nwarden occupation of the Southside penthouse flats, at various committee\nlevels but continue to get the unsual noncommittal replies. There is\nan Open Meeting with the College Secretary to discuss the recent policy\nwhich I hope will be well attended. I will report the outcome of\nfurther discussions verbally at the UGM.\nSouthside Fire Alarm and Security\nI have continually raised these issues with the Estates Secretary and\nam extremely dissatisfied with the answers Don Clark has given. The\nlatest \"official waffle\" to the Union's queries is that nothing can\nbe done without the GLC representatives approval (security) - they\nvisited the Halls two weeks ago. The new automatic fire alarm system\nwas commissioned yet again last week and once more failed dismally.\nIt appears to me that Estates get more and more incompetent as the\nweeks go by'. The only apparent reasons for their ineptness seem to\nbe stupidity or gross mismanagement (see the continuing saga of the\ncentral launder et te below!).\n\n"

Be there!\nF aix nn miH HH nMi Clubs\nUndergraduate Research\nOpportunities Programme\nAt the Education Forum meeting last week it\nbecame obvious that very few students know\nabout the URO P scheme.\nThis is a College-wide scheme which allows\nundergraduates to participate in research\neither in their own or a different department.\nParticipation is the name of the game; it is not\na formal project-type activity with an\nexamination at the end of it. You are free to\njoin or opt out at any time\u2014it is up to you,\nsince you will be working in your own time.\nTo get into the scheme you should get hold\nof the URO P Directory, which is available in\nyour departmental office, or else from Prof JC Anderson, Room 714, Elec Eng. The\nDirectory lists the names of staff members\noffering to take URO P students and briefly\ndescribes their field of research. The idea is\nthat you choose something that looks\ninteresting and go and chat up the member of\nstaff. If you take to each other you're in!\nThe amount of time you spend on your\nresearch is your affair, but the more you put\nin the more you get out of it. The first reaction\nis always T hardly have time to keep up with\nthe course, never mind anything else'. Past\nURO P students will tell you it's surprising\nhow much spare time you find you've got,\nonce you get involved and interested.\nQuite a few URO P research programmes\nl lead on to a summer job and we have\nl organised matters so that you can be paid a. bursar y during the summer vacation to\nIcontinue working on your research. This does\ni not attract any tax or other deductions, but\nwon't make you rich! The money has to be\nfound by your supervisor, but if he's keen to\nj have you he will usually find a way of raising\nI the necessary. There is a( very) small amount\nI of central funding to help out and we've had a Tew bursa ries from the Nuffield Foundation.\nI One thing that emerged from the discussion at the Education Forum was that URO P programme in the second year can give you a 'flying start for your official, formal project in\ni the third year. But 'the main thing was the\nj tremendous satisfaction and enjoyment that\nthe active students had got out of part ic ipa tion.\nSince our Directory is getting a little long in\nthe tooth, we propose to run URO P small ads\nin FELIX each week to up-date information\non the research programmes currently\naccepting students.\nJC Anderson\nThis House Believes:\nImperial College Not Need k!!

This region stretches for six\nhundred miles westwards from Nantes, and\nwithin it there are wide variations of climate,\nsoil and production methods. The wines are\nmainly white, light and have a pronounced\nand refreshing acidity. One of the best known\nLoire wines is Muscadet from Seure-et Maine, a soft, very dry wine. Also from the\nLoire are the sparkling wines of Vouvray and\nSaumur, as well as the pale and piquant wines\nof Sancerre and Ponilly-Fume. The tasting\nwill be given by Oddbins, and it should be\ngood!\nWMWBWmFrlday, February 24, 1984WM WM MAD MARCH II\nThe Carnival\nIf you've had the courage to get within\nreading range of the orange posters currently\nlying around College you will realise that\nthere is to be a Carnival next Friday 2 March.\nRather imaginatively titled Mad March 2 this\npromises to be one of the best carnivals for\nseveral years.\nThe main attraction (no, not the late bar!)\nis not one, not two, but FIVE of the best\nnew(ish) bands around at the moment.\nRanging from John Peel favourites The\nOrson Family through to Cook da Books one\nof Liverpool's best new pop groups this is one\nof the best line-ups seen anywhere in London\nfor quite a while. For a rather more detailed\npreview of the bands see the FELIX music\npage next week.\nIn addition to this there is an alternative\ncabaret including John Hegley and the\n'Popticians' writers of some truly wonderful\nsongs about spectacles! There is also a steel\nband, Jazz in the Lower Lounge and two\nseparate discos. One of these discos will\ncontinue well into the not-so-early hours and\nfor those feeling slightly less energetic films'\nwill be shown all night. Hopefully, the\nprovision of toast and free coffee should\nenable you to keep going and stagger out into\nthe morning. Tickets are available at \u00a34 from\nthe Union Office and appointed salesmen and\n\u00a34.50 on the door.\nIncidentally for those of you who are\ninterested in a spot of drinking the bar will be\nopen until 2:00 and the event is in the middle\nof the cheap-price promotion week.\n\n"

    "content": "MA5TERFIE.CE5\nJ \u00bb fAKA tip A Hf Elf Sarah Daniels' new play about the sexes is\nlittle short of brilliant. Aggravating in its\ninconclusive ness it raises questions which\nare inescapable and persistently recurrent.\nRowena is a happily married woman\nzealously going about her job with pardonable naivety. Her mother is very happy for\nher and would do anything to keep her from\nglimpsing the troubled marriage of her\ninadequate middle-aged parents. Her close\nfriend, Yvonne, also has an unhappy\nmarriage. She cannot relate to her husband\nand, catalysed by a stressful career as a\\ woman teacher in an all-male comprehensive\nschool she establishes a frigid wall between\nmen and herself. Under both these influences\nRowena's view of man is peeled like an onion\nbefore her eyes, her hereditary neurosis\nbegins to break through and in a fit of anger\nshe pushes a man who harasses her into the\npath of an oncoming car.\nMasterpieces forces its audience to be\nsubjective. One may argue that Rowena's actions are excusable because she is latent ly unbalanced, that her friends are impassive\nand impenetrable towards men, that her\nhusband is immature and demanding. This is\nwhat makes it so disturbing. But each of\nthese characters have been created, indeed\nover created in or aer to give every member of\nthe audience someone to whom they can and\nmust relate, inescapably, to the play's end.\nWhat separates feminism and fem in it y in a super c ili vised and over permissive society is\na complete inability for people to communicate at any level. This Miss Daniels makes\nperfectly clear. The view, partly promoted\nby class, that either sex can exist independently of each other presently\nemphasised by major advances in medicine is\nabsurd and nihilistic, but is sustained. The\ngap between the sexes is filled by the media\nand each must view the other through it.\nMasterpieces is sparsely produced and\nonly competently acted. Some of it is\nremarkably funny. Alas it only runs till early\nFebruary although I hope it makes an\nappearance again in the not distant future.\nThe play text( available from Methuen for\nabout \u00a31) is a cheaper alternative and is\nmoney well spent for any one.\nJohn Burgess\nLittle Shop of Horrors at the Comedy\nTheatre.\nStrange things are happening on Skid\nRow. There's been a total eclipse of the sun,\nand in Mushnik's florist shop, a curious new\nplant is starting to grow. And then people\nbegin disappearing mysteriously\nThe trouble begins when Seymour the\npathetic unloved dogs body of Mr Mushnik,\nfeeds his plant Audrey II with drops of blood.\nBut Audrey II is a man-eater and only\nSeymour has any inkling of Audreyll's cannibalistic tendencies. For the meantime\nlife on Skid Row continues as normal.\nMr Mushnik despairs for his decaying\nbusiness\u2014soon he'll have to shut up shop\npermanently. Seymour has a hopeless\npassion for Mushnik's beautiful assistant, the\nlisping Audrey, and namesake of the plant.\nAudrey, however, has problems of her own.\nShe's got a shady past; and somewhere\nlurking in the background, a real mean\nboyfriend who beats^hemp BU'bad she's loo afraid to leave him. Later we see her\nboyfriend Orin in the leather and chains of his\ntrade\u2014a truly professional sadist, who gets\nhis kicks from nitrous oxide. But, as in all\ngood musicals, all ends well as it always\nshould.\nLittle Shop of Horrors is a zany new\nmusical and warmly recommended to\nanyone with a sense of humour and fun. It\nboasts an engaging collection of characters,\n. supported by an energetic be-bop trio of\nsupposed truant high school girls. But, best\nof the lot, is THE PLANT, which just grows\nan' grows until it fills the stage; and has a definite personality all its, own. 'Feed me' it\nplaintively whines to the distraught Seymour\none moment, and 'FEED ME' it deafens him\nwith the next. Who, what, can check its\ngrowth? And if you think its a pure fiction,\nstop, and think again. After all, as the brightly\ncoloured souvenir brochure tells me. The\nshow first sprung up in New York, spreading\nto Los Angeles a year later and now has flung\na tendril across the ocean to London. New\noffshoots are sprouting in the form of Tshirts, records, badges and posters\nClaire Moss\nTHE BIKO\nINQUEST by Jon Blair and Norman Fenton\nat the Riverside.\nThis is the first production at Riverside from\n(the) United British Artists, a collection of\nestablished actors and actresses including\nGlenda Jackson, John Hurt, Albert Finney\n(who appears here) and very recently,\nHarold Pinter.\nThe Biko Inquest is an abridged reconstruction-of\u2014the 3Q. day trial following the\ndeath of Steve Biko, allegedly from a brain\ninjury sustained whilst in custody at Port\nElizabeth, South Africa. It is not, as\nsuggested, a 'courtroom drama'. The proceedings are relaxed and sedate and those\nwho seek gavel-happy justices keeping order\nover chic swooning juries will not find them\nhere. Indeed, due to the inescapable\natmosphere inside Riverside, the cast may\nfind things a lot more sedate than either they\nor their audience require.\nIn fact, short of being highly informative, I found the play held little to keep my\nattention. At present the production is highly\nunpolished (it appears some of the cast still\nrely heavily on their scripts). The testaments\ndrag and the cool-headed bureaucratic\ndissection of a man's controversial death\nbecomes monotonous lip-service to established facts and frankly, a tedious bore.\nThe production is to be screened for\nChannel4, and I dare say will\nimprove before then, appealing more to that\nform of medium. In the meantime, I can only\nwish UB A success in this and any future\ndrama at the Riverside. John Burgess\n(Below)\nStrange goings-on in The Little Shop\nHorrors.\nPage 6| \\ Friday.

    "content": "Residence: What next?\nJohn Smith demonstrated his training in the diplomatic service to\ngood effect yesterday afternoon at the open meeting on residence. He\nspent a great deal of time not saying very much, sidestepping\nquestions and being deliberately vague on specific points. He\noutlined the policy and explained the reasons for its implementation\nbut refused to say anything concrete on important issues. He refused\nto guarantee that the increase in student rents would not be above the\ngrant increase or that residence services like security and\nmaintenance would not suffer. These things he said 'would have to be\ndiscussed' College work very slowly and deliberately. The Rector's policy committee has already decided that it is going to remove\nsubsidies on residences whether it is practical or not. Most objections\nto the new policy have been over-ruled and all the students union and\nStudents Residence Committee can do now is reiterate its\ndissatisfaction.\nWhat must be made quite clear is that the students union will not\naccept increases in rents above the student grant increase, even if it\nmeans going on a rent strike.\nElections\nElections are upon us once again and after 5:30pm today be prepared\nfor an onslaught of posters, leaflets and canvassers.\nThis year we have the usual selection of wimps, self-publicists and\ncrack-pots standing for posts. You can read their works of fiction (ie\nwhat they are going to do to improve the Union next year if elected,\netc) in next week's FELIX. There will be a special elections\nsupplement in FELIX next week containing the election manifestos\nof all the sabbatical candidates. Manifestos must be no more than 300\nwords and should be submitted with a photo or line drawing by\nMonday 1:00pm. Make sure you go to the Hustings U GM next Thursday where you\ncan hear the candidates for the four sabbatical posts make speeches,\nand answer questions in an attempt to persuade you they are the best\npeople for the job. The Hustings speech and particularly the\nquestions from the floor afterwards are a very good test of the quality\nof a candidate and whether they know what they are talking about.\nBallot Boxes\nIf anyone would like to earn \u00a31.75 an hour sitting on ballot boxes on\nMarch 5 and 6 they should hand their names in at the Union Office by\nnext Tuesday.\nCredits\nHugh Southey, Jon Jones, Lynne James, J Martin Taylor, Nick\nShackley, John Burgess, David Jones, Steve Bishop, Dave Parry, Matt\nFawcett, Malcom Gray, Ulysses, John Scott, Simon Nield, Pete\nColeman, Paul Griffiths, Nigel Atkinson, Jonathan Gerson, Michael\nNewman, Maz and Pete.\nA special thanks to Ronald Reagan for holding up this week's bingo number.\nPallab Ghosh\nSharpshooter's Puzzle\nOne Saturday, as the football results were coming\nin, the teleprinter broke down and six results didn't come through. The matches involved Arsenal,\nChelsea, Tottenham, Liverpool, Everton, Man Utd,\nSunderland, Middlesbrough, Newcastle, Birmingham, Coventry and Wolves.\nFour of the matches were between teams from the\nsame area. David Coleman, with typical fluency,\nsummed up the six results as follows:\n1. There were 13 goals scored altogether.\n2. No match was goalless.\n3. Wolves didn't score.\n4. Sunderland won.\n5. Only one score line occurred twice, the rest\noccurred once each.\n6. Tottenham achieved the best result.\n7. No team scored more than two goals.\n8. Arsenal played Everton.\n9. If Newcastle has scored one less, and Liverpool\nhad scored one more than they did, they would each\nhave achieved the same result as Arsenal.\nWhat were the matches played and the results?\nGood luck, everyone.\nSolution, criticisms, comments to me at the FELIX\nOffice by 1:00pm on Wednesday please. \u00a35 from\nMend-a Bike for the randomly selected winner.\nLast week's solution\nSince the requests for chess puzzles came from\nchess players, the problem did not state which way\nWhite was playing. Those who do not play much\nchess will not know the convention that White\nalways plays up the page, and will find the\nstraightforward solution that Rook takes Knight,\ncheckmate. Those of you who do know that White\nmust play up the page, or suspected that there must\nbe something more to it, will have been looking for\nthe following:\nWhite cannot move his pawn, rook or queen for\nvarious reasons, so it is the white king which must\nwin the game. White's strategy is to take his king\nfrom the bottom left-hand corner to the top right-hand corner, take the knight and promote his pawn\nto a queen to win, or simply checkmate as Black will\nhave to move his bishop.\nBlack must move his knight to and from the square\nwhich it now occupies to stop the white pawn from\npromoting, as he cannot move any of his other\npieces. If White tries to move his king across the\nboard on the black squares, he will arrive at the\nwrong time, ie when the black knight is covering the\nsquares, so White must arrive at either one move\nsooner or one move later. He may only move on the\nblack squares to avoid the black bishop, as the black\n. bishop can move out and put him in check, then\nqueen his pawn, but there is one white square on\nwhich he is safe; the one in top left-hand corner. So\nhe moves on black squares to that corner white\nsquare, back onto the black squares, and will now\narrive at the correct time to capture the knight,\npromote to a queen, and win.\nOf four, mostly correct, answers Richard Fox of\nChem Eng 3 was the randomly selected winner and\ncan collect the prize from the FELIX Office after\n1:30pm on Monday.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board and is printed by the Union Print Unit Prince Consort Rd^XJ\nTel 01-589 5111 ext n1048 or internal 2881.

    "content": "News feature]\nLAUWERYS: TWELVE MONTHS ON\nJust twelve months after the publication of the Report on Student\nResidence at the College by John Lauwerys, a number of decisions\narising from its recommendations have been implemented by College\nSecretary John Smith in his College Notice on the Management of\nStudent Residence. This seems like an appropriate time therefore to\nconsider the background to the Lauwerys Report, the major\nrecommendations of the Report itself, and the decisions which have been,\nor may soon be, taken arising from them.\nThe Background to the Report\nThe report was commissioned by\nJohn Smith in July 1982 in the\nlight of the financial constraints\non the College caused by\neducation cuts. At present the\nCollege effectively sub sid is es the\nresidence accounts by not\ncharging it for certain services the\nCollege provides to residence\nbuildings, principally main ten ance. This it is allowed to do\nunder University Grants Committee (UGC) rules, which\nalthough they forbid any direct\nsubsidy of residence do allow\ncertain expenditure on residences, known as the ' UGC dispensations'. Despite allowing\nthe dispensations to continue the\nUGC has asked universities to\ncalculate their costs and include\nthese as a footnote to their\nresidence accounts. In addition it\nis the College's stated policy to\nphase out the use of the\ndispensations over a period of\nseveral years, so that IC calculating their cost for\ninclusion as footnotes is also a per cursor to them being a direct\ncharge to the residence account.\nThis was the starting point\nfrom which Mr Lauwerys, Senior\nAssistant Secretary, took up the\ntask of writing his report, which\nruns to 75 pages plus appendices.\nIt considers all aspects of\nresidence management but is\nprincipally concerned with how\nthe College can end the use of the\nUGC dispensations by making\neconomies in expenditure from\nand increases in income to the\nresidence account.\nMore Residence Places\nHowever, the first of the report's58 recommendations is\nunconnected with finance, or at\nleast with economies. He\nconcludes that in order to\nmaintain the ability to offer all\nfirst years who apply a place in\nresidence the College will require\nan additional 125 places in\nCollege owned accommodation\nby October 1985. This need is\nprincipally due to the loss of\nplaces with the ending of the lease\non the Fremantle Hotel next\nyear. John Smith has accepted\nPage 4 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nthis recommendation in his\nrecent notice on student\nresidences and the College is\npresently considering a number\nof properties for purchase. Such a purchase will, however, place\nadditional strain on the residence\naccount because it will have to\nservice the loan required to buy\nthe new property.\nMuch of the rest of the report is\ndevoted to examining every\naspect of residence management\nand making recommendations\non everything from space\ninvaders machines to the price of\nwashing in hall laundries. These\nrecommendations fall into two\ncategories: the blatantly obvious\nand the completely crack-pot.\nHowever, this article will\nconcentrate on the report's findings on residence finance as\nthese are the only ones of much\nconsequence.\nEnding the Subsidies\nThe report correctly identifies the\ncompeting calls on the residence\naccount over the next few years as\nbeing: the decision to end\nsubsidies; the need to increase the\nstock of accommodation; the\nmaintenance and improvement\nof existing residence; and the\nneed to keep rent increases in line\nwith increases in student grants.\nThe resulting recommendation\ngives top priority to the first two\nof these with a lesser priority to\nmaintenance and no importance\nbeing at tat ched to limiting rent\nincreases. Lauwerys states that\n'student rents will have to be\nincreased above the levels that\nwould be necessary merely to\ncover any increase in the running\ncosts of residences.'\nJohn Smith in his notice on\nstudent residence makes no\ncomment other than the need to\nachieve a rent income to cover\ncosts, although he does not rule\nout subsidies. The policy of\nidentifying all the costs of\nresidence and including them as\nfootnotes to the accounts is to be\nimplemented, and as a first step\nthe cost of the security and\nmessenger staff in Princes\nGardens will be charged to the\nresidence account from next year.\nMr Smith denies that decisions\nhave already been taken on the\nending of further subsidies, but it\nis widely believed the College will\nend them as soon as it feels able\nto.\nMaking up the loss\nWith the increased drain on the\nresidence account as a result of\nthe ending of subsidies it will\nobviously be necessary to\nincrease income. Over 80% of\nincome to the residence account\nis from student rents during term\ntime, the remainder being\nvacation rent income. The\nLauwerys Report takes much\nspace considering possible\neconomies in residence management such as reducing the\nnumber of wardens, but besides\nthe measures being mainly\nundesirable in themselves the\nsavings which could be achieved\nfrom them are small beer indeed\ncompared with the extent of the\nsubsidies which are to be phased\nout. The value of those subsidies\nwhich are presently identified as\nfootnotes to the accounts is about\nhalf a million pounds. The scale\nof the proposed savings from the\nReport's recommendations for\neconomies is that of a few tens of\nthousands at most even if there\nare drastic cuts in the levels of\nmaintenance. Ironically, some of\nthe recommendations in the\nReport would actually involve\nnew expenditure as Mr Lauwerys\ndiscovered that there are areas of\nresidence, notably the student\nhouses, which are already\nunsatisfactory.\nClearly then there will have to\nbe a large increase in rent income\nif the subsidies are ended.\nLauwerys pins his hopes on an\nincrease in the vacation letting s income. He suggests an increase\nof 50% should be possible by\nbetter marketing of the College's residences as tourist and\nconference accommodation.\nVacation Lettings\nIn' 1982 the residence accounts .\nbenefitted by about \u00a3250,000\nfrom vacation letting s. In 1983\nthis was increased to around\n\u00a3360,000. But there is a definite\nceiling on vacation income since\nthere are only so many rooms to\nbe let, and the rent can only be\nincreased above a certain level at\nthe expense of less custom. Last\nyear a high occupancy rate was\nachieved during the summer,\npartly due to more IC students\nstaying in residence. At times\nthere were literally no rooms left\nanywhere in College accommodation. Clearly then the scope for\nfurther increases in vacation\nincome are limited, although\nsomething could be achieved if\nconference trade was increased.\nBut the scope for extra income\nfrom vacations would only cover\na fraction of the subsidies to\nresidence that it is proposed to\nremove. And of course vacation\nincome can vary greatly from\nyear to year with the vagaries of\nthe tourist and conference trades.\nRent Increases\nAlthough it is not stated\nexplicitly, there is therefore a tacit assumption in the Lauwerys\nReport that student rents will\nhave to go up faster than grants in\norder to phase out the present\nsubsidies. Even if the vacation\nincome achieved in 1982 is\nultimately doubled in real terms,\nwhich seems unlikely, there\nwould still'be shortfall of around\na quarter of a million pounds\neven if one just includes those\nsubsidies which have already\nbeen costed. This works out as a rent increase of nearly six pounds\nper week for each resident in halls\nand houses. The College hopes to\nintroduce such an increase slowly\nover a number of years, but if\nsubsidies are to be removed then\nan increase of this magnitude is\nultimately inevitable.\nComment The consequences of the College's policy of ending the subsidies\nto the residence account will, it seems, be very grave indeed for\nIC students. Accommodation is to be seen purely as a service to\nstudents which must be completely self-financing, rather than an\nintegral and essential part of academic life. It is right that teaching\nand research should receive the highest priority in times of\nfinancial pressure, but this cannot be at the expense of giving\nother areas a zero priority. It is in the academic interest of the\nCollege to keep student rents at affordable levels\u2014if not IC will\nhave difficulty attracting the best students.\nThere is a clear need for a re-think of College priorities towards\nresidence. We already have some of the most expensive halls\nanywhere, and rents have increased well ahead of grants over the\npast five or six years.\nI Friday, February 24, 1984 II FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "NEWSPAPER OF ER1AL COLLEGE 1\n3\nALL TALK, NO PROMISES\nJohn Smith, College Secretary, yesterday refused to give any guarantee\nthat student rent increases would not exceed grant increases. He was\nspeaking at an open meeting called to discuss the policy laid out in his\nrecently is su tJ notice on the management of student residence. It was\nalso revealed at the meeting that whilst Mr Smith had had some\nreservations about putting staff wardens back in the Southside penthouse\nHats (as reported in last week's FELIX), he has now been ove ruled by the\nRector who has decided the extra wardens will definitely be appointed.\nMr Smith in his opening would necessarily lead to large\nremarks laid great emphasis on rent increases.\nthe College's commitment to\nincrease the number of places in\nresidence. He pointed out that\nthe total number of places had\nnearly doubled whilst he had\nbeen College Secretary, and he\nwished to see further increases.\nA large number of questions\nwere asked by the audience,\nwhich included many people\ninvolved in residence such as\nwardens, sub-wardens, head\ntenancy managers, finance\npersonnel and the entire Student\nServices Office staff. Union\nPresident Gaynor Lewis asked\nabout the implications for\nstudent rents of the new policies,\nand asked for assurances from\nMr Smith. He was unable to give\nany guarantee about rents, but he\nsaid he did not think the policies\nSeveral questioners referred to\nthe security patrols in Princes\nGardens, the cost of which is to\nbe transferred to the residence\naccount. Mr Smith believed the\ncost of this would effectively be\ncovered by an increase in\nvacation letting s income, and\nthat anyway it should be for the\nresidence community to decide\nthe level of security they require\nand to pay for it. He claimed\nthat any future reduction in the\nsubsidies would be dependant\nupon the improved performance\nof the summer letting s scheme,\nand would not occur if the\nvacation income did not increase\nto cover their withdrawal.\nHe was questioned about the\nneed for a Managing Surveyor\n( Residences) to oversee\nmaintenance and cleaning of\nresidences. In the most forceful of\nhis answers he emphasised that\nresidence was 'big business' with\na \u00a32m turnover, and that it was\nessential to have a proper\nmanagement structure rather\nthan the present ad hoc situation.\nHe felt that the appointment\nwould also enable wardens to\nconcentrate more on the social\nand pastoral aspects of their job\nwhich he saw as particularly\ndesirable because of the low level\nof social intercourse between\nstaff and students compared with\nten to twenty years ago.\nThe proposed appointment of\na staff warden in Evelyn Gardens\nwas also mentioned. Mr Smith\nsaid the College's policy was to\nappoint such a warden if more\nhouses were acquired in the area.\nIt was felt that the appointment\nwould be necessary to provide\ncontinuity in relations with the\nneighbours as the student\nwardens usually remain in the job\nfor only two years.\nHe was able to answer all\nquestions about the new\nresidence policy in a reassuring\nJohn Smith\nmanner without giving any\nguarantees or closing any of his\noptions for the futures. Clearly,\nas an exercise in allaying anxieties\nwithout restricting his room for\nmanoeuvre the meeting could be\nconsidered as something of a success for Mr Smith. However,\nsenior Union officers present at\nthe meeting still appeared\nsceptical about Mr Smith's good\nintentions when interviewed after\nthe meeting by FELIX. The\nreality of the matter will perhaps\nbe revealed in a clearer light after\nthe announcement of next year's rent increases, expected in May.\nIan Thomas\nNo 6681\nBeauty and the Beast\nThe RCS Hustings U GM took place yesterday amid controversy\nsurrounding the presidential election. One of the candidates, Ann\nCollins, has complained that she was not notified of the deadline for\nsubmission of manifestos for inclusion in RCS Broadsheet. However,\nthe Broadsheet Editor, Simon Banton, claims that he personally\ninformed Miss Collins of the deadline, and that the deadline was well\npublicised. There is one other candidate for RCS President, Ian\nThomas.\nThe meeting heard hustings speeches from Miss Collins, presently\nthe Chemistry Dep Rep and Mr Thomas, RCS Transport Officer. Miss\nCollins criticised RCS for failing to provide for more than a small\nminority of its members. Mr Thomas was confident that with a wide\nexperience of R CSU over three years he was the best candidate.\nHustings were also held for the post of Vice-President. The candidates were Sean Davis, presently ICU Hon Sec, and Simon Banton,\nBroadsheet Editor. The Hon Sec post was unopposed with the election\nof Paul Bloomfield bien g ratified by the meeting.\nElection for the two contested posts will take place by paper ballot in\nall RCS departments on Monday. Ballot boxes will be open from\n9:30am to 5:30pm and you will need a Unioncard to vote.\n\u2022 nH HH B afl BI FELIX. February 24, 7 9 8 4 HH HB HH HH1 Ann Collins\nI Free/\n\n"

    "content": "9. 199th Episode of the Central Launderette and Southside Saga\nThe central launder et te and gym facilities are due to be completed on\n5th March, 1984, i.e. very soon. As accustomed as I an to the incompetence and total ineptness of the Estates section, even I find it hard\nto believe that for a project originally intended to begin in Easter\n1983, they could have mismanaged the project as effectively as to be\nan estimated 5 weeks behind the third schedule! The original deadline\nwas mid-September 1983 - a mere 6 months ago!\nIt appears the Martial Arts Clubs that have been waiting over six\nmonths for the new Southside gym will now have to wait at least another\ntwo months before they are able to use the facility. As the project is\nthe responsibility of the Estates section perhaps Martial Arts would\ncare to do their training in Room 527, Sherfield*unti1 the gym is\navailable.\n*presently inhabited by the ever-industrious Mr. Don Clark\n10. Harlington Gravel\nI have discussed this project with Dr. J. Stocks, the Union's advisor on this issue. The project is long ten, Test bore holes\nwill be driven over the Easter period and tenders invited over the\nsummer. ACC are satisfied that no disruption to sporting activities\nwill occur during the test bore hole development. Obtaining\nplanning permission could take anything between two and six years,\nand the exploration is estimated to take a minimum of ten years\nafter that.\n11. Harlington Bar\nDue to the profit being made on the bar this year, the student\nrepresentatives suggested the possibility of lowering the prices.\nI made a rough financial assessment of the bar at Harlington and\nthen,with the ACC Chairman, approached Peter Mee, (Chairman,\nAthletic Ground Committee) with the Union's recommendations. The\nend result being a decrease in the prices of between 6 and lOp per\npint. Discussions about reducing the prices even further are\ncontinuing at present.\n12. Sports Centre Charges\nLast term College suggested the possibility of raising the admission\ncharges in the Sports Centre. The Union was obviously against such\na move and undertook to compile information regarding charges at\nother universities. 40 questionnaires were sent out and I have\nreceived 23 replies. The student representatives on South Kensington\nSports Committee will have presented the results of the questionnaire\nto College by the time of the UGH, thus I will report verbally on the\noutcome at the meeting.\n13. Job Descriptions\nThe Executive Job Descriptions have been updated and were approved\nat Council on February 13th. The 1984/85 Sabbaticals will be elected\non the updated versions.\n14. Conference Committee Report\nAs mandated by the U GM of 6th December, Peter Rodgers attempted to\ncall a meeting of the designated individuals responsible for investigating the nature of, and representatives attending, conferences.\nUnfortunately, only three representatives were able to attend. The\ncommittee's recommendations are outlined below:\na. ICU should continue to send delegates to worthwhile conferences.\nb. Insufficient information was available to discuss INCOST.\nTwo delegates should be sent to NUS Conference if the opportunity\narose in the future.\nCouncil discussed the relevant issues of the report, including the\nfact that to send delegates to NUS Conference required a change in\nUGM policy. Council decided to send Jim Boucher and Steve Bishop\nto the 1984 INCOST Conference in April.\nEstimates\nI shall be seeing the Financial Secretary in the first week of March to\ndiscuss the estimates of income and expenditure for 85/85. I have now discussed claims with most of the officers and am producing a first draft\nof the estimates for College.\nSelf-Defence\nCollege has made an application to the Metropolitan Police for the provision\nof a Self Defence course at Imperial. These courses, which consist of\nfour 2-hour lectures/demonstrations, are run by the Special Constabulary\nand are much in demand in London. Iam collecting names of students\nInterested and shall be informing them as soon as we have set up dates\nfor the course. If successful, I hope we can run the course regularly\nat Imperial, particularly when the new intake arrives next October.\nCarnival\nThe biggest event of this term will take place tomorrow in the Union\nBuilding - Carnival. Featuring bands, bar extensions, etc., this event\nwill cost \u00a34.00 (or \u00a34.50 on the door). Tickets are available from the\nUnion Office and CCUs.\nTransport\nSteve Lane and Bruce Bricknell are now sharing the responsibilities\nof Transport Officer after the resignation of Frazer Wigley, due to\nacademic pressure.\nWe are presently looking at the demand for vans by priority and non-priority clubs, with a view to making the vans more widely available.\nA questionnaire has been sent out to all clubs and by the time of this\nmeeting we should have discussed the replies. We are in the process\nof replacing 0B W, our oldest van, and are considering buying a17 seater\nvan rather than the normal 13-seater van.\nVolleyball Court, Union Building, JCR\nNetting has now been placed over the shut es and in the roof of the\nVolleyball Court, and benches provided in the changing rooms. College\nhas agreed to pay for the installation of showers In the mens and\nladies changing rooms. I had hoped that this work would have started\nby now but a lack of communication between one end of Level 5 and the\nother seems to be holding this up.\nThe East Staircase has now been painted and we hope to have the Concert\nHall painted at Easter. Other changes in the Concert Hall include the\ninstallation of a permanent control box at the back of the Hall and,\nhopefully,a change in the lighting control.\nSeveral improvements are being made to the JCR. The orange chairs are\nbeing recovered and several chairs repaired, new tables are being\nacquired and lighting bars are to be installed in the ceiling, Estates\nwilling. Hooks are also being provided in the buttery ceiling for\nparty decorations, obviating the need to remove the ceiling tiles.\nHonorary Secretary's Report\nDeputy President's Report\nUnion Equipment\nInventories are still coming In from Union Clubs (very late) -there now only being about ten clubs which have not yet filled\none in.\nAt present some clubs are under the Impression that if they\nborrow a piece of equipment from outside College It Is automatically insured. However, this is not so - the borrowed equipment\nis only insured if Iam told beforehand (so X can inform Commercial\nUnion Assurance). This present situation will continue until C.U. have completely drawn up the new \"Block\" policy which they are\npresently doing.\nSTA\nI have had several meetings with STA to consider possible sites for a student travel centre at Imperial College to replace the old London\nStudent Travel Office. Iam now discussing with College the possibility\nof using the seldom used Bar Counter in the north-west corner of the\nJunior Common Room. STA has provided plans of the proposed office which\nis similar to their offices at QM C and ULU, We hope to have the travel\noffice installed and open by Easter but at present progress depends on\nthe College so it is anyone's guess as to whether anything will have\nhappened by this meeting.\nBars and Refectory\nOn Friday, 24th February, I shall be attending the third meeting between\nthe Finance Section and Refectories to discuss Bars Pricing Policy. Over\nthe past few months I have been working to get the prices in the bars\nreduced to those of other Student Union Bars in Colleges In London. I have shown College that it is possible to reduce prices without affecting\nthe profitability of the bars by managing purchasing better. Despite\nthe fact that I have identified several areas where College could make\ngreat saving they have remained sceptical. The meeting on Friday should\nbe the last and I hope to be able to report (he outcome at this meeting.\nThere has been a lot of discussion and rather more criticism about the\navailability and accuracy of information on the management of the\nrefectories, particularly with regard to trading figures-. Eventually\nIam receiving useful figures for the bars (by force of personal persuasion)\nbut there is still very little useful information about Refectories. What\ninformation there Is points towards several problems in the\nRefectories of which managers cannot help but be aware. Whether they will\nact on this information is a matter of concern. Despite the fact that\nCollege has neve' repudiated the criticisms I made of Refectories last\nDecember, ab sol.i ly nothing has happened since. Discussions about the\nappointment of a lew manager seem to be the usual hot air and the\nattitude of administrators seems to be one of condoning gross mismanagement\nrather than having to introduce change.\nHaving negotiated with Commercial Union Assurance for some\nmonths about the premium paid for the four Union vans, they came\n\u2022back to me with a new estimate of approximately \u00a32,750 for the\ncoming year - this being a10% increase on this year's premium.\nHowever, Prudential Insurance (through NatWest) have offered the\nsame policy for a mere \u00a31,220. We therefore changed - on the\n12th February, 1984, when the motor policy was due for renewal -from Commercial Union to Prudential as it will mean a saving of\nover \u00a31,550 a year.\nKey Cards for parking barriers\nIn spite of all my efforts in trying to get all those people who\nstill have key cards from last year to return them, we are still about twenty down on what we should have. College have so far been\nunwilling to make up this deficit due to security reasons - so let's hope that for next year a new key card will be issued or College will\nlisten with a more sympathetic ear.\nUnion Duplicating Service\nFor the first time this year, everything is working well. We have\nnow got two geste ner s, one photocopier and one typewriter available\nfor general use (I.e. clubs and societies) in the Union office.\nIf you don't know how to use ages tet ner s nd need to produce something\non one - come along to the Union office and I will show you how.\n\n"

Their form both on the field and in the after-match bath\ncan be seen this week on the Six O 'Clock Show on LW T. IC's girls beat QM C Ladies team 8 points to 4 in a match\nplayed last week at Harlington. Then they pla veda seven-a side\nmatch against a team of IC men, the B2s, drawing four all.\nThe action was recorded by cameras from the light-hearted\nmagazine programme, who were invited along by IC Ladies'\ncaptain Maribell Anderson.\nAfter the games the thirty ladies retired to the extremely large\nbath in the changing rooms. Their modesty suitably protected\nby large quantities of foam the TV camera? were allowed in to\ninterview them. A few of the men present were invited to join\nthem in the bath, but for some reason they all declined the offer!\nEstates Cock up Pipe\nin Refectory Fiasco\nThe Estates Office at IC received\ncriticism from the Refectories\nSection this week after installing\na new pipe in the kitchen in\nSouthside Refectory, running\nfrom floor to ceiling.\nWhen plans for the pipe were\nfirst drawn up, Mr Mooney\ninsisted that a three-sided\nwooden shield be placed around\nthe pipe to prevent contamination of the kitchen area. Estates\nagreed and installed the large\nwooden duct taking up more\nthan thirty square feet of floor\nspace.\nThey then put in the nine inch\nred pipe\u2014some distance outside\nthe wooden duct!\nThere are, at present, no plans\nto remove the redundant wooden\nduct. The siting of the pipe is such\nthat refectory staff are obliged to\nram it with their trolleys as they\npass.\n(If anyone knows of any good\nEstatesfiascos please send them to\nme via the FELIX Office-Ed.)\nGod Exists-Official\nIC students decided, by only a small majority, that God exists.\nAt a Debsoc debate on Tuesday\nan attentive audience heard\nAndrew Pettman propose that\nthere was enough evidence to\nbelieve that God exists. Chris\nBarton vigorously opposed the\nmotion, suggesting that belief in\nGod was merely the result of\nsome people's insecurity, he did\nnot however include himself in\nthis group. After a series of\nquestions, and several interruptions in Chris Barton's summing-up, the motion was\nnarrowly carried.\nElections-the Writing\nis on the Wall\nThe Union elections committee\nhas withdrawn its ban on outside\nprinting of publicity for the\nsabbatical elections. The\ncommittee had decided that all\nprinting had to be done on\nFELIX or Union Office\nequipment, as reported in last\nweek's FELIX. After complaints\nfrom a number of candidates that\nthey had been given insufficient\nnotice of this decision, the\ncommittee withdrew the ruling.\nThe ruling was designed to\nprevent the recurrence of the\nsituation last year when a candidate had high quality\nposters printed at an outside\nprinters but produced only an\nextremely modest receipt\n(disgraceful!-Ed). The elections\ncommittee still intends to be strict\nin its enforcement of election\nexpenses, which it has set at \u00a350.\nThe committee has also\ndecided that votes marked with\nan X will not be counted, only\nthose with the regulation 1 by the\ncandia te of first choice will count.\nNominations for the four\nsabbatical posts close at 5:30pm today. At the time of going to\npress candidates had been\nnominated for all posts, but one\npost was still uncontested. The\nnames of candidates and their\nmanifestos will appear in next\nweek's FELIX. Guilds still without Shie\nThe Guilds U GM on Tuesday\nwas a rather low-key affair. There\nhad been a rumour that visitors\nfrom University College were\nexpected, but none of them\nappeared, which from their point\nof view was probably just as well,\nsince Spanner and Bolt were\nnowhere in sight. Guilds excuse\nwas that the car bringing the\nmascot to the meeting had\nbroken down. However, it is\nwidely believed that, fearing a mascot ry raid at the sparsely\nattended U GM they decided not\nto bring the mascot. As it turned\nout, the only minor disturbance\nwas caused by a few inquisitive\nindividuals from RCS.\nMeanwhile, Guilds are still\nwithout one of their shields\nfollowing the raid by UC students\nthree weeks ago. UC Union is\napparently still searching for the\nshield, which is believed to be in\nthe possession of an individual\nstudent who is refusing to return\nit. They have agreed to pay for\ndamage caused by the raid.\nBlack Day at IC\nDramsoc's Black Corned};, directed by Raj Singh went down very\nwell with enthusiastic audiences on Wednesday and Thursday\nnight in the Union Concert Hall. Black Comedy is a contemporary\nfarce by Peter Schaffer about a young sculptor who has invited a rich German millionaire to see his work, not knowing that his\nfiance has invited her awful father to meet him on the same day. To\ncomplicate the plot further the lights blow and the characters are\nin darkness. The play was well performed by a small and talented\ncast and serves as an aperitif to Dramsoc's major production of\nGalileo later this term.\nFELIX Friday, February 24, 1984 Page 3\n\n"

How do you think the\nUniversity Nas changed?\nMonsigno. Kent: It's very difficult to say. The chaplaincy has\ndefinitely grown. My impression\nof student life as a whole is that in\n1968 it was very active. Since then\nit has varied greatly. At the\nmoment it seems very conservative. \"To be involved in\npeace is essential if\nyou are a Christian\"\nFELIX: How much interest did\nyou have in disarmament as a student at Oxford?\nKent: When I was a student I was totally apathetic. I did all the\nnormal things. I didn't question\nthe lectures I was given or\nchallenge the structure in any\nway. I had no original ideas that I can remember.\nFELIX: So when did you actually\nbecome involved in CND?\nKent: I was influenced by a Jesuit\nArchbishop, Thomas Roberts in\n1963/4 and the Nigerian war of]\n1969/70 really made me politically aware.\nFELIX: After joining C ND how\ndid you actually become general\nsecretary?\nKent: I think C ND was so pleased\nto find a priest who was\ninterested that I was pushed\nforward to various positions and\nfinally became a member of C ND general council.\nFELIX: Why do you think C ND has regained its influence as a major national political force?\nKent: It was not because of me or\nany other member of C ND, but\nbecause of outside influences\nsuch as the stupidities of the\nBritish and the American\ngovernments' new weapon\nsystems.\nFELIX: Do you see any conflict\nbetween being general secretary\nof C ND and a Catholic priest?\nKent: Not in the slightest. I think\nthat to be involved in peace is\nessential if you are a Christian.\nAs a priest I don't think I take a party political view and I try to\nencourage non-violence and love.\nPage 8 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 ^ \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 M Monsignor Bruce Kent, General Secretary\nof C ND has been much maligned and\nmisrepresented by the National Press. He has\nbeen described as a subversive and a Russian\nagent. In a frank interview with Felix,\nMonsignor Kent talks about his background,\nhow he became involved with C ND and the\nconflicts he has faced within the Church.\n'Dont wait for CND to do something for you. Ask\nyourselves what you are doing for CND.'\nFELIX: What actually happened\nlast year when the papers\nsuggested that Cardinal Hume\nmight ask you to resign as C ND General Secretary?\nKent: I think the Cardinal was\nunder a lot of pressure from the\nCatholic Conservative groups\nwho wanted me to go because I was upsetting things they\nbelieved in. I think he had a very\ndifficult time. I think he behaved\nvery generously and fairly. He\nhas not asked me to leave C ND. FELIX: How long do you intend\nto remain involved with CND?\nKent: I have never thought that I would be aC ND officer\nindefinitely. However, I hope\nalways to be involved with C ND.I have been General Secretary\nfor almost five years and many\npeople, both inside and outside\nthe movement, probably think\nthat is long enough.\nFELIX: Do you find it a disadvantage in your work as a iF rl day, February 24, 1984\npriest to be a public figure?\nKent: It is an advantage for C ND that I am well known. It is a disadvantage for me personally\nthat I have no private life. If I go\non a tube or a bus I am recognised\nand people talk to me. I just\naccept that and live with it.\n\"In twenty years' time\nwe will either have\nkilled each other or\nwe will have changed the structure of\nthe world\"\nFELIX: Looking at the world\nsituation for the moment where\ndo you see the world in twenty\nyears time?\nKent: In twenty years time we will\neither have killed each other or\nwe will have changed the\nstructure of the world. I really\nmean that, because in twenty\nyears time the new weapons will\nhave resulted in a war.\n'Everyone must make\nup their own minds.\nI would hate to\nforce people\"\nFELIX: Turning to more local\nissues. Do you think Imperial\nCollege students should work on\nweapons projects?\nKent: That is something for the\nindividual. Some people will\ndecide they can't do it. I respect\nthat very much indeed. Others\nhave to do it because they have no\nother way of living. In which case\nthey should keep on raising\nquestions about the structure of\nthe College, challenging MoD contracts.

Do you think the\nscientists' signatures on such a pledge are an important step\ntowards disarmament?\nKent: The more people of general\nesteem in the world who take this\nsort of stand the better.

    "content": "Edinburgh Festival Fringe During the latter part of August and early part of September artists, critics\nand audience flock from all over the world to take part in the Edinburgh\nFestival. The Festival itself consists of six components. The main international arts festival, the much publicised military tattoo, the film festival, jazz\nfestival and book festival. However, it is the fringe festival that most people\ncome to see. The fringe provides much freshness, innovation and originality\nand has become the largest and most famous aspect of this annual arts\njamboree.\nEdinburgh Festival Fringe\nThe Fru.je consists predominantly of\ndrama, in all its forms. There are musicals,\nmime, children's shows, serious drama,\ncomedy and the inevitable revues. To many,\nit is these revues for which the Fringe is most\nfamous; Cambridge Footlights has been I given considerable press coverage, with such\nfamous performers as Rowan Atkinson.\nOther groups also do well with revues; IC\nDramsoc's1982 Tour\u2014under the name of\nArtsux performed The Wire Guided Revue\nin the Fringe Club with much success.\nHowever, revues remain one of the most\ndifficult forms of drama to perform well. After\nseeing London University's Midnight Excess |\none critic exclaimed '...there must be ONE funny revue on The Fringe!' Despite the\ndifficulties and the bad reviews, half the\nmedical schools in London can be seen,\nbedpans and bad jokes at the ready. Just\ndon't fall ill during The Fringe!\nWhile many of the revue performers are\nhoping to be spotted by the ubiquitous Radio\n4 producers who are supposed to roam The\nFestival in search of script writers, others set\ntheir sights on one of The Scotsmans' Fringe\nFirsts. The Scotsman is a daily newspaper\nprinted in Edinburgh which reviews most of\nthe Fringe shows and make 12 awards to the\nbest productions. These awards guarantee\nperformances outside Edinburgh, if not\ntelevision coverage; many of BBC's' Plays for\nToday' gained Fringe Firsts. Last year,\nadaptations of novels proved to be the\nwinning formula with two different\nCambridge groups gaining Firsts, one of\n'Metamorphosis' based on a Kafka novel,\nand the other 'Circe' based on Ulysses by\nJames Joyce. Both shows sold out very\nrapidly after the announcement of the\nawards.\nFRINGE FIRST S With only twelve awards, the majority of\ngroups just hope for a favourable review to\nboast both audiences and egos.\nFELIX H BHa^ HRH RH BH! Most groups expect an audience of about\n20 which is not many considering the effort\nrequired to produce a show.\nThe location of the venues is a major factor\nin audience attendance as well as the amount\na group pay for a slot. Two major venues\nattract the professionals-the Assembly\nrooms, who boasted Shiela Steffal, Tom\nRobinson & Radio 4's 'Fundation', and the\nCircuit, which made a heavy financial loss\nlast year. It is these venues which attract the\nnational press (both have a number of bars\nopen for most of the day-pure coincidence?)\nand hence the coverage. Yet there are a total\nof 130 venues, from schools, church halls to\npurpose built theatres used by the 494\nparticipating groups.\nHow To Get Involved\nImperial College has its own connections\nwith The Fringe through IC Dramatic\nSociety. Not only does Dramsoc perform\nregularly in College\u2014a production of\nBrecht's Galileo is being performed in a fortnight\u2014but, for the past three years, it has\nalso performed at the Fringe. In 1981\nDramsoc ran its own venue and performed\nplays written by College members. In 1982,\nunder the name Artsux, Dramsoc performed\nits own revue and two other shows. Last\nyear, however, proved to be the most\nsuccessful with the society running its own\nvenue and performing three shows: Between\nTime and Timbuktu by Kurt Vonnegut Jr,\nWhat do you say before you say goodbye by\nMelody Shahan and a dramatic anthology of\nmetaphysical verse.\nWKWMFriday. February 24. 1984MM MW Dramsoc's Box Office\nDram soc's venue, which they run; themselves,is situated on the west end of\nPrinces Street and is called Theatre West\nEnd.By running their own venue,Dramsoc is\nable to generate sufficient funds so that its\nown shows can occupy prime evening slots\nand make use of their own,wide range of\nequipment.Running the venue involves\nmuch hard work by members both in\nattracting other groups and converting the\nbare church hall into a theatre. \u2022\nMuch of the enjoyment of going to the\nFringe with Dramsoc results from the social\nlife-from meeting other actors in the Fringe\nClub,drinking until 2.00am and seeing some\nof the other shows on the Fringe.Also.by\nperforming alongside professional and semi-prof fes ional companies in front of an appreciative audiences is a total change from\nthe usual college atmosphere.For both the\nactors and the technical people,the experience is most rewarding.\nDramsoc are now making detailed plans for\ntheir 1984 Tour and are interested in seeing\nanyone-whether actor.directer or anyone\nwilling to help-as soon as possible.The work\nfor the Tour starts just after exams with\nrehearsals and set building taking place in\nLondon through July and August.The set-up\nof the venue starts mid-August with people\ntravelling to Edinburgh by car and train.The\nac como dati on is provided by Edinburgh\nUniversityjboth travel and ac como dati on is\npaid for by individuals. Dramsoc shows run\nfor either a week or a fortnight.If you are\ninterested in going on tour then pop up to\nthe Dramsoc store (above ICU Office,Beit\nQuad) any lunchtime.\nThe Edinburgh Festival-and Dramsoc's Tour-provide a unique opportunity to see\nand experience the world's biggest arts fest-| i val. lt is an opportunity not to be missed.\n\n"
