    "content": "Music\nLIVE\nThe Tom Tom\nClub\nThe Borderline Club, just off!\nCharing Cross Road is, let's face it, j quite p oxy. Spaghetti western\npara ph en alia dripping from every:\nsurface, bandolier ed girls\nwandering around trying to sell you'\nTequila slammers and the occasional\nbandi to in the corner. The lighting\nis poor, the stage small and the\nrecords bad. It makes you feel like\nyou're in a North Mexican version\nof Liverpool's old Cavern Club,\nwithout the enjoyment. Despite this\nthe club has some good bands on,\nlike the Tom Tom Club.\nThe Tom Tom Club are the\nhusband (drummer) and wife\n(bassist) team from Talking Heads,\nand it shows. Their sound is as clear\nand well produced as that of Byrne's band with a different style. They are\nfunkier, more emphasis is on the\nthem but are more rock orientated,\nbeat and bass and they are also\nextremely likeable. They don't try to\nout cool you like most other\npretentious pop purveyors, they\nsimply show you their talent and\ninvite you to have fun, and that's what you do.\nTheir music is brilliant but subtle.\nTo watch the guitarist (a David\nByrne\u2014Norman Jardine lookalike)\nyou think he cannot be playing the\nsounds which actually emerge, but\nhe is and his guitar gymnastics leave\nhis face unperturbed. Again with\nthe bass, about four notes emerge\nfrom every pluck or fretting move,\nwe thought there must be a backing\ntrack on the songs.\nTowards the end they were joined\nby Kirsty McColl (she was probably\njust knocking around the club) and\ndid a cover of Velvet Underground's Femme Fatal (you can forgive the\nclich es when they're done well).\nAlso a bit predictable was the\nrendition of Once in a Lifetime but so\nwhat, it was excellent and this was\na unique show. j LIVE\nGothic Voices\nMusic was just getting started\naround the time of the Crusades but\ndespite the lack of refinement and\ntechnique the court minstrels could\nstill write a good tune and\nChristopher Page has filled a gaping\nhole in the classical repertoire with\nrecordings from the Middle Ages of\ncourt and secular music by the\nGothic Voices.\nMuch of the music in this concert\nwas written around the time of the\ncoronation of Richard Coeur De\nLion, 800 years ago next year. It was\nsung largely in the conducted form,\neach part following the same note\nthe rough feel of War and Boy about\nstructure and beautifully performed\nby the four voices, contralto and\nthree tenors. Light relief was\nprovided by Christopher Page the\nnon-conducting musical director\nwho introduced each piece with\ncontemporary writings from the,\nperiod.\nThis year the Gothic Voices won\na Gramophone Magazine award for\ntheir latest work, Music for the\nKnights of the Garter and their finest\nwork to date,\" Music by Abbess\nHildegard of Bingen can be found in\nthe Haldane Library if you are\ninterested in hearing something just\na little bit different from Mozart or\nBeethoven. *\nC.D. L. ALBUM U2\nThe much heralded album/film/\nbook of the tour by the current\ndarlings of the music world has\nbeen added to the Haldane Library's record collection. A chronicle of the\nfo shua Tree US Tour of 1987 it is a mixture of live songs and new\nmaterial recorded in such hallowed\nlocations as Sun Studios, Memphis\nwhere Elvis became the King.\nNothing could rival the success of\nthe fo shua Tree and Unforgettable Fire\nand so U2-have taken leave of those\nstyles to explore their 'true roots'.\nHence, guest stars include Bob\nDylan, co-writing and playing some\nparticularly insipid organ on Love\nRescue Me, and BB King provides\nthe highlight of the album with his\nperformance on When Love Comes To\nTown. The new songs have some of\nthe rough feel of War and Boy about\nthem but are more rock orientated.\nU2 claim them to be better songs,\nbut those who preferred the lack of\nformal structure in early U2 will find\nlittle here to comfort them.\nOf the live stuff the covers, Helter\nSkelter and AU Along the Watchtower\nare frenetic and perhaps encapsulate\nU2 live better than versions of Pride\nand Bullet the Blue Sky which moved\nme less than their originals. A Gospel choir backing to Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For sounded\nfun but made it dangerously like the\nkind of Bible-bashing Gospel Rock\nU2 have managed to sidestep\ndespite their Christianity.\nSo all credit to a band who refuse\n' to rest upon their laurels and are\nadventurous. I loved the whole\nthing but in discovering their roots\nthey are moving away from their\norigins and those who liked Boy may\nnot necessarily feel the same wa j fc. about the men.\nSouthkenders\n0 \u00a3 Po(2 \u00a3 Tft ClC UW If\" C utc rio cop iu Es, OF fi+E OuT gM KOF QUfcfcNl'S GA-T \u00a3...\nMOP FlNlAUUW\nHfcfrtw Es H IS\nPeS fir JA\"n oN i'f i rAE FoR NElfrH BodK\nf(i.r\\ TtfL , v lb HfWE GoT A, Poo \u00a3 Vou.

    "content": "Letters\nUncaring\nCollege?\nDear FELIX,\nThree years ago my brother was poisoned by\none of the chemicals he was using as part of the\nthird year laboratory course of his Chemistry\ndegree at this College. After spending eight\nweeks in intensive care and a further one and a half years in hospital he is left requiring a stick\nto walk and with permanent brain damage.\nHe returned to College last year to finish his\ncourse with the result that he was awarded a3rd class degree by the Department. Previous to the\naccident he had been capable of at least an upper\nsecond. I would have thought that on purely\ncompassionate grounds the College could have\nmade some allowance for the difficulties which\nhe had undergone; the months when even the\nweight of a sheet caused a gon sing pains in his\nlegs, the recurrent hallucinations and nightmares\ncaused by the prolonged stay in intensive care,\nthe list goes on but would, I feel, be of little\ninterest to the College authorities.\nI can only hope that at the very least the\nincident highlights the College's attitude to the\nundergraduates about whose welfare it professes\nto be concerned.\nI would add for anyone thinking of a retort that\nthey may find their hollow excuses fall on ears\nas deaf to them as their own were to my brother's case. 1 realise that the College is purportedly a centre of excellence, but at what price excellence?\nYours,\n7 Healy, Elec Eng\nMathematics\nComment\nDear Editor,\nAfter the last two issues of FELIX I find that\nI must comment about an article, two editorials\nand a letter.\n1. Article headed 'Maths Room' (11 November,\np5) The views attributed to me about the disposition\nof Mathematics lecture theatre 213 in Huxley and\nabout Mathematics Department Academic Staff\nare not ones which I hold and I would not express\nthem in such an offensive way even if I did. It\nis also distressing that you should elicit\ninformation for a congratulatory (?) piece about\nan increase in Mathematics undergraduate\nrecruiting and misrepresent it instead as a grouse\nabout Physics timetabling. Despite the\nimplication of your article, I was unaware of any\nsuch difficulty.\n2. Editorial (11 November, p3 and 18 November,\np3) \u2014Letter from a student (18 November, p2) It would, of course, be invidious for me to\ncomment about the academic progress of a particular student. However, I would like to point\nout that the particular accusation that you make\nwith regard to examination res its is quite false,\nas the student himself states. I am in complete\nagreement with the content of his letter\u2014with the\nvery minor exception that the letter he received\nwas from our Head of Department, but with my\nwholehearted endorsement. No student could be,\nor would be, refused any res it to which he/she\nwas entitled under University Regulations. Your\nunderstanding of the situation is quite wrong and\nyou should withdraw your accusation, rather\nthan imply that you have special knowledge.\nYours sincerely,\nFH Berkshire, Director of Undergraduate Studies.\nA Frank\nopinion\nDear Editor,\nAn item in the editorial column of last week's FELIX strongly implied that the Mathematics\nDepartment have improperly refused to allow a student to res it examinations. This is a false and\noffensive suggestion. No students in this\nDepartment have been deprived of their right to\nres it any examination they have failed.\nYours sincerely,\nFG Leppington.\nA second\nFrank opinion\nDear Editor,\nEditorial articles in the last two issues of FELIX\n(11 and 18 November) have suggested that the\nMathematics Department has tried to deprive a student of his right to res it examinations. This\nis false and offensive.\nYour persistence in repeating this serious\naccusation, in spite of correspondence that\npointed out the error, is astonishing and\nmischievous and beyond the bounds of\nreasonable journalism. Your 'understanding of\nthe situation' is incorrect.\nLet me set the record straight. No students have\nbeen or will be deprived of their rights to res it examinations; no attempt has been made to take\nsuch a vindictive course of action.\nYours sincerely,\nFG Leppington, Head of Department of\nMathematics.\nNo Problems\nin Physics\nDear Editor,\nYour news item headed 'Maths Room' (FELIX,\n11th Nov) suggests that the increased Maths\nintake this year has led to timetable problems in\nPhysics, The writer appears to have been\nunaware that the Physics Department\nrelinquished (apart from one or two lectures a year) the use of Theatre 213 in Huxley well over\na year ago so that the consequent changes to the\nPhysics timetable could not possibly have had\nanything to do with the increased Maths intake\nthis year. A quick check with any 2nd Year\nPhysics student would have confirmed this. As\nI explained to the FELIX reporter who telephoned\nme, we relinquished the use of Theatre 213 in\nHuxley as part of a Colle;;e wide rational is ation of the use of lecture theatres. The only new\ndevelopment on tl ron t this year was that a single lecture on - . Wednesday of term was\nrescheduled. Th are very good relations\nbetween Physic a th s and I hope that your\nnews item has >ed any Physics students\nto feel that ,.-.ve been in any way\ndisadvantaged 1; ie increased Maths intake this\nyear.\nYours sincerely,\nGareth /ones, Director of Undergraduate\nStudies in Physics.\nReplies to last\nweeks letters\nDear Editor,\nDave Thomas could quite easily have had the\nanswer to his queries if he had had the common\nsense to come to see me. AH stationery items,\nunless priced by the company concerned, are less\nthan the recommended retail price. All books are\npriced by the publishers. We are not allowed by\na legal agreement to alter that price. Incidentally,\n'Ecology' by Begon, Harper & Townsend is\n\u00a315.75 in IC Bookshop, and has been since July\n1987. With regard A4 copy safe pockets, if Mr\nThomas would care to buy some for 4p; the\nBookshop would like to order 200 each of the\neight colours, and to show my generous nature,\nI will give him 5p each! The Bookshop is owned\nby the Students' Union, so we have to make a profit. That is why Library carrier bags are sold\nin the Library at cost, and if we sell any, we make\n2p. Bookshop carrier bags are free! So, if Mister\nThomas would care to come and see me, he can\nbe quoted Recommended Retail Price, and then\nhe can choose our price or the manufacturers.\nRoy Hicks, Bookshop Manager.\nOverworked\noperators\nDear FELIX,\nJust a few lines to explain to Miss Warren what\nour job consists of. We deal with over eighteen\nhundred external calls a day, that's without the\ninternal help we give, not forgetting that half our\nexternal callers are from overseas calling for\nstudents.\nWe also have phone grading s to deal with,\ntelephone bills and telephone moves to deal with.\nWe try out best to help as many people as we\ncan, if anyone would like to try and do better they\nare very welcome to try.\nYours faithfully,\nTelephone Exchange.\nPage 2 FELIX November 25 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Booze\nAlcohol Special\nThe first Campaign of Welfare\n'89, the Union Welfare project,\ntakes place next week. The aim\nof the week is to promote\nawareness of students at this\nCollege about the effects of\nalcohol, both long and short\nterm. The culmination of the\nweek is a low-alcohol and nonalcoholic drinks promotion in\nthe Union and Southside bars\non Thursday evening and\nFriday lunchtime. I hope you\nwill come along and try some\ndrinks that you might even\nlike!\nENTERING THE BODY\nAlcohol is a depressant drug. When\nit is swallowed it travels to the\nstomach and small intestine (or gut)\nand is absorbed through the wall of\nthe gut into the bloodstream.\nThe amount of alcohol in the\nblood and the rate of absorption\ndepend on the amount and type of\nalcohol drunk, the speed of\ndrinking, and the amount of food in\nthe stomach. For a woman it can\ndepend on her menstrual cycle,\nalcohol being absorbed more rapidly\njust before a period and during\novulation. If she is taking the\ncontraceptive pill, alcohol is\nabsorbed and meta boli sed more\nslowly.\nThere is also evidence to suggest\nthat fizzy drinks carry alcohol more\nquickly into the bloodstream. Once\nin the blood, alcohol travels to all\nareas of the body within a few\nminutes quickly affecting the\nworking of the brain. (Fig. 2)\nThe immediate effects of drinking\ndepend solely upon the amount of\nalcohol in the bloodstream\u2014the\nblood alcohol concentration or BAC.\nBlood alcohol concentration varies\naccording to a person's sex, weight,\nbody composition, and speed of\ndrinking. Women tend to have a higher BAC than men after drinking\nFig. 1\nDRINKS WHICH HAVE THE\nSAME ALCOHOL CONTENT\n% pint\nof beer\n1 glass of\ntable wine\n1 glass of\nsherry or port\n1 single whisky\ngin or brandy\nUnit of\nalcohol\nFig. 2\nHOW ALCOHOL ENTERS\nTHE BODY\nbrain\nalcohol arrives\nat brain in bloodstream\nstomach\nalcohol absorbed into\nbloodstream through\nstomach wall\nliver\nthe liver begins to\nremove alcohol from\nthe blood\nintestines\nalcohol absorbed into\nbloodstream through\nsmall intestine\nthe same amount because they have\nless body fluid to dilute the alcohol.\n(Fig. 3)\nThe depressant effect of alcohol on\nthe central nervous system means\nthat 'messages' take longer to travel\nalong the nerves in the brain.

It is caused\neither by a virus or a chemical\ncarried by sperm to the cervix. This\nrisk much exceeds the pill effect,\neven accepting the Oxford report.\nThe rest of the news is good.\nCancer of the endometrium (the\nlining of the womb) was more likely\nto occur in women using high-o estrogen pills, but the complete\nopposite applies to combined pills.\nResearch has shown a halving of the\nrisk if the pill is taken for one year\nand a threefold reduction after five\nyears.\nAt least nine studies report a clear-cut protective effect against cancer\nof the ovaries. After five years of\ntaking the pill there is a two to\nthreefold reduction in the risk and\nsome protection continues among\nabout are not easy to detect.\nPerhaps the most that can be said\nis that the pill is not quite so\nunnatural as appears at first site.\nThe pill is not quite\nso unnatural as\nappears at first sight\nParadoxically, many pill critics give\nlittle thought to smoking, which is\nundoubtedly much more of a medical risk.\nDr Swann, of the Imperial College\nHealth Centre, compared the\nadditional risk taken on by pill-users\nwith the additional risk involved in\nstudying in London over, say,\nSouthampton.\nIn conclusion, the pill risk,\nalthough not negligible, is very\nsmall, except for women who\nsmoke, are very overweight, or have\nother conditions such as high blood\npressure. In such cases the risks\ninvolved in taking the pill are small\ncompared with the medical risks\nalready present.\nTwenty controversial years of\nresearch have passed since the\nintroduction of the pill but quite\nwhat risk faces pill users is still\nsomething of a mystery. There is\none point in the debate, however,\nwhich stands out as being\nalarming. Victor Wynn, Professor\nEmeritus of Human Metabolism at\nLondon University warned 'As a scientist, I just think about how\nvery little research there is and how\nfew experts there are. I think it's very worrying'.\nOral contraceptives\u2014'the pill'\u2014are\nnow claimed to be the most widely\nused form of contraception. These\nartificial hormones work by\nimitating the natural hormones\npresent during pregnancy by\npreventing the ovaries from\nreleasing ova. They are undoubtedly\nFears about the pill\nhave been in\nabundance ever since\nits creation\nthe most reliable of all\ncontraceptives provided that the\nwoman strictly follows the\nprescribed schedule, usually one pill\ndaily for three weeks followed by a week's rest during which there is a period of bleeding like a menstrual\nperiod.\nFears about the safety of the pill\nhave been in abundance ever since\nits creation. People are often\nconcerned that even if it did not\nhave unwanted side-effects, of\nwhich there are many, the pill's main contraceptive effect in\nsuppressing the cyclical activities of\nthe ovary and of the pituitary gland\nis 'unnatural'. However, John\nGuilleband, in his book The Pill,\nclaims that 'having menstrual cycles\nand periods is actually not entirely\n'natural'. Biologically, suppression\nof the menstrual cycle for years at\na time may, in fact, be a much more\nnatural state of affairs.'\nIn the past, before there was\neffective contraception, the normal\nthing was for a woman to be either\npregnant or breast feeding during all\nthe child-bearing years. A doctor\nworking in central Africa was once\nvisited by a women in her early\nforties who was worried by\nbleeding. By excluding all the other\npossibilities, he eventually diagnosed this as a normal period. She\nhad been anxious because she never\nremembered having such a thing\nbefore! John Guillard concludes:\n'Far from the myth that periods are\nnormal and necessary to 'flush out\nthe flues', they really are not what\nnature intends.'\nAs a support for this notion, it\ndoes seem that some cancers, such\nas cancer of the ovary, are\ncommoner in women who have had\nmore rather than less natural\nmenstrual cycles during their lives.\nProbably for this reason the pill\nseems to be protective against\ncertain types of cancer.\nThe Oxford/FPA study-1983\nThe pill risk, although\nnot negligible, is very\nsmall\nsuggests increased rates of cervical\ncancer with increasing duration of\nthe pill. After more than eight years\nthe maximum rate was 2-3 times\nthat in non-users. However, cancer\nex-users for at least ten years, maybe\neven for life.\nIt would be wrong to ignore the\ncontradictions to this optimism.\nVictor Wynn, for one, still remains\nunconvinced. He first criticised the\npill in 1969 when he claimed that the\npill could cause severe damage to a woman's health. Since then he has\ncontinued his research, emerging\nfrom his lab every so often to cause\nan enormous stir, the latest of these\noccasions being two weeks ago.\nWynn's latest huge study of 1,800\nwomen shows that even low-level\nlevon org estr el contraceptives have\ntoo much of an impact on blood\nlipids (the fats that can build up to\ncause heart attacks, strokes and\nother problems). He claims this is\nlikely to put pill-users at a greater\nrisk of heart disease. But even Wynn\nadmits that the risks he is talking\nEPILOGUE\nNot a very long time ago having\nsexual intercourse before marriage\nwas widely accepted as being\nmorally wrong. Sex in itself, in or\nout of marriage was rarely\ndiss cussed certainly not in public.\nToday contraception is as normal\nto the average teenager as going to\nschool, and phrases such as 'sexual\nfreedom' are liberally broadcast by\nthe generation of the 60's and 70's with some degree of proud ness. Those who retain the old stance of\n'no sex before marri ge', whether\n\u2022 their objection is on religious, moral\nor other grounds are labelled, at\nbest, old-fashioned or frigid.\nThis situation, in itself, somewhat\nnegates the effect of the slogan\nsexual freedom'. We are free to\nchoose not only whether we want\nto have sex but also whether we\ndon't want to: It is an important\nfeature of our society that those who\nbelieve that the evidence against\n'sexual immorality' is strong should\nbe able to live according to their\nviews without fear of social\nrejection.\nPerhaps the most important\ncriteria for happiness is self-content.\nIf each one of us is capable of\naccepting first our own, and then\n.\u2022our neighbours view-point with\nrespect, then freedom in its true\n'\n\u2022 sense will be a word we can all be\nI proud of.\nNovember 25 1988 FELIX Page 15\n\n"

The former was a dream, the latter remained the reality,\nand her way to survive. But everyone needs warmth, just like human\nbeings need water to keep themselves alive, money to survive and love\nto retain their sanity. Did it really matter then how one got these things?\nWhat is right and wrong when it is a question of honour and disgrace?\nWhen one is cold one does not think about such dilemmas. One just\ndoes not think. The mind goes numb and the body tells you what to\ndo. The body does not know right from wrong.\nThe vast doors to the dance halls opened and extravagantly dressed\npeople poured out laughing and singing. She tried to recognise those\nmens' faces among the herd whom she had been with and to see if\nthe v had a woman by their side. If she was ugly and stout then she\nwas probably their wife (the thought was comforting), otherwise a whore. If a whore, then why not her instead. Was she growing old?\nOh that is frightening indeed!\nHer clientele was varied and quite colourful. She always asked the\nmen about themselves. Some did not want to talk but there were others\nwho wished to talk more than anything else. There were the fresh-faced\nsoldiers in their woollen hats and green uniforms who behind their\nmasquerades of tough young men were mere adolescents wanting to\nsee what life is really like before they were slaughtered in the carnage\non the battlefront; then there were the upper middle class men who\nhad wives and children, but their lives were too uneventful and seeking\nthis forbidden pleasure they found the excitement of little boys stealing\napples in an orchard. Occasionally pretty faced boys came up to her,\nblushing with embarrassment, trembling with fear and lust, and not\nknowing what to say. She felt sorry for them because they had\nundoubtedly been pestered and dared by their'friends to lose their\nvirginity. She made a very good listener and showed her understanding\n.in the conventional expressions of sympathy.\nMaria was born in a large family of eight brothers and sisters. Their's was a dingy and morbid house, overcrowded, disorganised and above\nthis sad existence prevailed an overpowering stench of human faeces.\nHer father had sent her away at the age of nine to work in rich peoples'\nhouses, wash the dishes, wipe the floors and entertain the children.\nThere was nothing her mother could have done to let her stay, she did\nnot have the will.

She and countless other women like her were the in d is pensi ble Pariahs of the society. Condemned and damned, they were nevertheless!\ngears in the machinery and, ironically, very human too. She often had\nthe money to buy a new dress, she even had the memory of the\nwhispered words of love in her ear by so many men. But her's was\na false world; a world that had been pronounced morally wrong by\npriests and law-giver s whose hypocrisy and corrupt values were neve:\nquestioned. She could not find solace in religion. Her parents had bee i religious but that had not given her any comfort. The men who calle i on her went to Church on Sundays but did that make them better human\nbeings? Neither did she have a lover, somebody with whom she could\ntalk to and snuggle up to on cold evenings.\nMaria did not have many friends. In a way that\nwas not her choice. But she never mixed with her\nfellow women who often got together and\ngossiped and laughed about their latest exploits.\nThey used to sit around a table in their favourite\ncafe and 'the eldest mistress would take the\nconversation in her own hands.

It became\nthe Royal College of Chemistry and\ndedicated to the work of Sir\nHumphrey Davy. It opened\naccepting 50 students, said to be\n'gentlemen of all ages, ranks and of\na variety of professions who follow\nchemistry as a profession or as the\nobject of scientific taste'.\nThe RSM was founded as the\nGovernment School of Mines and\nScience Applied to the Arts in\nJermyn Street in 1851. It was part of\nthe Museum of Practical Geology\nand the Geological Survey and its\nfirst director was Henry Thomas De\nla Beche. It became the Royal School\nof Mines in 1863.\nA Royal commission of 1870 set\nup to inquire into 'Scientific\nInstruction and the Advancement of\nScience' recommended a move of\nboth Royal Colleges to South\nKensington. This was completed in\n1872, to the first Huxley Building in\nExhibition Road. The building\nremains standing today as the\nHenry Cole wing of the V&A. Laboratories were provided for the\ninstruction of Physics and Biology\nand a chair of mathematics was\nestablished and in 1881 the School\nbecame the 'Normal School of\nScience and Royal School of Mines\nIts first Dean was TH Huxley who\nwas perhaps heir to the Prince\nConsort's vision for Science and Art\nteaching in South Kensington. The\ncircumstances of its foundation and\ngrowth owe much to fears that\nBritain would fall behind the\nadvanced technology of Germany\nboth industrially and militarily.\nThe name Normal School of\nScience was devised as an analogy\nto the Parisian Ecole Normale but\nwas unpopular and soon changed\nto Royal College of Science.\nThe City and Guilds College was\nfounded,, because in 1876 the\nCorporation and Livery Companies\nof the City of London believed their\nattention should be directed to the\npromotion of technical education. In\n1878 the City and Guilds Institute of\nLondon was formed and established\nthe Finsbury Technical College.\nThe Institute moved to a site,\nleased at peppercorn rent from the\n1851 Commissioners, in Exhibition\nRoad. In December 1884 six\nstudents enrolled\u2014five men and\none woman.\nThe Royal College of Science building in Exhibition\nRoad, now part of the Victoria and Albert Museum\nThe 1851 Exhibition\nPrince Albert, the Prince Consort,\nhad a vision for developing South\nKensington into an area devoted to\nScience and Arts in 1849. By the\nturn of the century the dream was\nfulfilled and in South Kensington\nstood; the Royal Albert Hall, The\nRoyal College of Art, the Royal\nCollege of Music, the Natural\nHistory Museum and, of course, the\nImperial College of Science and\nTechnology.\nThe idea of holding an 'Exhibition\nof Works of Industry of All Nations'\ncame to Prince Albert as President\nof the Royal Society of Arts in June\n1849. It became the 'Great\nExhibition of 1851', arguably still the\ngreatest of its type to have been held\nin Britain. It certainly made a substantial profit, and the\ncentre piece was 'The Crystal Palace'\nerected in Hyde Park.\nA Royal Commission of August\n1850 had run the exhibition making\na profit of \u00a3186,000. A second\nSupplementary Charter of 1851 gave\nthe body powers to dispose of this\nsurplus. The 'Commissioners for the\nExhibition of 1851' bought an area\nof South Kensington on which\nscientific and artistic societies could\nlocate themselves to 'extend their\ninfluence upon productive\nindustry'.\nAt the direction of the Prince\nConsort the Commissioner bought,\nthe irregularly-shaped 87 acres, at\n\u00a33,500 per acre, in 1854 with a loan\nfrom Parliament. The land was\nundeveloped country estate\nbelonging to several families and the\nSmith's charity.\nThe Commissioners speculated\nwith the land and set up a 'Main\nSquare' bounded by Kensington,\nExhibition and Cromwell Roads,\nand Prince Albert Road, now\nQueen's Gate. The rest was\ndeveloped by private builders for\nresidential housing.\nSixteen and a half acres of land\nwere sold to Parliament for the\nNatural History Museum in 1863,\nwhich was not staite d for a further\nten years. The Estate of the 1851\nCommissioners was used for\nexhibitions and the Horticultural\nSociety Gardens until 1880.\nPermanent buildings housed the\nScience and India Museum and the\nPetent Collection.\nThe exhibitions of national\nportraits, scientific instruments,\ninventions and colonial artefacts\nenabled the mortgage repayment to\nbe completed, and the Estate\nallocated sites for e duct ional institutions in 1880\nNovember 25 1988 FELIX Page 9\n\n"

The entirely new\nformation consisted of a couple of\nplayers promoted from the 2nd team. From the push back, Imperial\ntook control of the midfield with\nAndy Lewis and Mark Rayfield\ncoming forward at every\nopportunity from defence, the game\nbeing played in Mill Hill's half. After\nsustained pressure, Imperial scored\nfrom a penalty short corner, through\nGary Knaresborough. After several\nother opportunities for Paul\nSkipworth had gone begging, Mill\nHill put the pressure back on\nImperial by scoring minutes before\nhalf-time. In the second half IC\nplayed their own inimitable brand\nof happy hockey. Mill Hill were\noutclassed in every department and\nwere unable to maintain any\npossession. Paul Skipworth partially\nredeemed himself when M Rayfield\nconstructed an easy scoring\nopportunity for him. One umpire\nblew for full-time and captain Hari\nVadadevan offered 3 cheers for the\nopposition. The other umpire then\nadded some extra time and IC were\nforced to resume their domination.\nThe final whistle then blew, 6 cheers\nfor the opposition.\nBADMINTON\nHome win\nOn Wednesday we played aU AU match at home versus Kent. Men'sI found it incredibly easy due to the\nfact that the Kent men's didn't turn\nup. Men's II also found it incredibly\neasy due to the fact that despite\nKent actually producing a team they\ndidn't provide any opposition. The\nladies team had injury problems and\nwere forced to concede most of the\ngames and therefore the match 7-2.\nThis weekend we entered twelve\npeople in the Hammersmith\nindividuals. Everyone played well\nand we had a few notable successes.\nIn the men's doubles 'Kid' Kiernick\nand 'Boy' Bartle having come\nsecond in their group lost to\n'Grandad' Hughes and Steven\nBaddley (oops! I mean Mike\nBradley) in the semi-finals 21-10.\n'Grandad' and Mike then went on\nto win the final 15-5, 15-9. In the\nmixed 'Grandad' and 'Flo-Jo'\nCohen got to the semi-finals after\nwinning their group and lost closely\nto 'Captain Boo Boo' and Nisha\nGhelani 21-17.\nTHE SPORTS PAGE\n2nd XI match winner Max Michaelis\nLADIES HOCKEY UAU Success\nIC l sts \u20141\nKings l sts \u20141\nIC l sts \u20143\nRHBNC\u20141\nDespite an influx of high class\nplayers, IC ladies have had a tough\nstart to the season. In the UAU and\nUL League Premier Division,\nhalfway through term, they had\nfailed to win a game. A goal against\nKings College by Meriel Jones last\nSaturday earned a draw and, more\nimportantly, a boost in confidence,\nWednesday brought a visit from\nRoyal Holloway in the U AU. Always one of the strongest ladies\nsides in London Holloway beat IC\n16-0 last year. Not surprisingly, IC\nentered the game with some\ntrepidation, but also a lot of\ndetermination. From the outset IC\nplayed the more skillful team\nhockey. Debbie Tucker and Sam\nSpence soon took command of the\nmidfield, allowing Lisa Preedy and\nGail Barnett to combine well when\nattacking down the right.\nAggressive stopping and tackling by\nCaptain Alison Seward ensured that\nIC played much of the game inside\n\u2022 the Holloway '25'. Di Thomas\n[finally provided the much deserved\nbreakthrough with a determined\nindividual run and shot before half-i time. In the second half Emma\nPownell had to hold the defence\nfirm against a renewed Holloway\nattack before Alison Seward put the\ngame safe by getting on the end of\na Gail Barnett cross. Di Thomas'\nsecond goal, made sure that\nHolloway's late penalty flick goal\ndid not endanger IC's win.\nKARATE Wazari\nOn Saturday November 19, the\nClub competed i,i the Eighteenth\nPortsmouth Invitation Karate\nTournament and won a large\nnumber of medals and trophies\nagainst tough opposition from clubs\nall over Southern England despite\nthe absence of Maiken Engelstad\n(3rd dan), the winner of last year's Ladies Kata Competition.\nIn the Men's Individual Kata, Paul\nPotter came a respectable 5th, but\nany disappointment at not reaching\nthe finals must must have vanished\nwhen he was later part of the 3 man\nteam which won the Team Kata\nwith a brilliant performance of\n'Empi'. The synchronisation of the\nKata movements of our team\nsurpassed that of any of the others.\nIn the final of the Ladies 10th to\n4th Kyu Kumite (fighting), Sari\nLindberg completely outclassed her\nopponent in the final, quickly\nscoring an 'up pon' with her 'Jodan\nMowashi-Geri' (kick to the head) to\nwin. There were also placings in\nsome of the other events. Kate\nTaylor came second in the\nBrown/Black Belt Ladies Individual\nKata and joint third in the Kumite.\nAndy Kerley was runner-up in the\n10th to 4th Kyu Mens Kumite losing\nthe final by a' waz ari' in a fight\nwhich went the distance, and the\nMens Kumite Team were narrowly\ndefeated in the semi-final of their\ncategory, losing by 3 wins to 2\ndespite looking set to win when 2-0\nup at one stage.\nSAILING\nMatch Report\nSunday morning saw IC sailing\nteam battling the elements in an\nattempt to reach Queen Mary\nreservoir for a match against the\nCity University.\nOn arrival at the reservoir we\ndiscovered that there was quite a breeze blowing, and 2 intrepid\nmembers of the IC team ventured\nonto the water to test the conditions.\nAfter a few minor setbacks the two\nteams were afloat and the serious\ncompetition began. Some IC sailors\nwere slow to pick up the new\ntechniques needed to sail the\nstrange boats, resulting in some\nspectacular acrobatics. However, we\nput up a good fight and by the end\nof the day the teams were roughly\nlevel.\nAll in all, an enjoyable (if wet)\ntime was had by all.\nMEN'S HOCKEY Third Class\nIC 3rd XI\u20142\nRHBNC 3rd XI-0\nIC 3rd XI\u20147\nBracknell 3A \u20141\nWednesday saw the 3rd XI's second\ntaste of U AU success with an\nimpressive win over the supposedly\nstrongest opposition in the division.\nAlthough the ball was continuously\nin the opposition half as IC piled on\nthe pressure, this pressure was\nun rewarded aS the opposition\ngoalkeeper pulled off some good\nsaves. Ten minutes into the second\nhalf IC spirits were raised when a short corner was awarded and\nMartin Grafer made no mistake with\na fierce drive to end RHBNC's stubborn resistance. As the light\nfaded good work by Hansaan Majid\nwas rewarded when he struck from\nclose range to make it 2-0 and\nshortly afterwards he came close to\nmaking it 3-0.\nA much depleted 3rd XI side\nmade it four wins in a row with a spectacular win over some\ngenuinely good opposition. Indeed,\nearly on the opposition looked\nextremely dangerous and\ngoalkeeper Robert Hunwick had to\ndo some good work. However, a fine individual goal from Steven\nBurton and good, solid defensive\nwork to thwart their efforts seemed\nto break the opposition team and\nthe floodgates opened. Two more\ngoals from Steven Burton and one\nfrom Vijay Thakur made it 4-0 at\nhalf-time and by full-time Steven\nBurton had scored 5 goals and Vijay\nThakur 2, to complete an amazing\nafternoon.\nNovember 25 1988 FELIX Page 19\n\n"

However, although alcohol\nhas some nutritional value, it is of\npoor quality because it lacks\nvitamins, proteins and other\nessential nutrients. Also, unlike\nfood, alcohol is burnt up almost\nexclusively in the liver which means\nthat the liver is one of the first parts\nof the body to suffer from excessive\ndrinking. (Fig. 5)\nThe liver burns up alcohol\nsurprisingly slowly. The rate varies\nfrom person to person according to\nbody weight and to the enzyme\n(dehydrogenase) in the liver, but as\na general rule it takes as many hours\nas the number of drinks for the body\nto completely burn up all the\nalcohol. It is a little known fact that\nit is possible to fail a breath aly ser test 24 hours after stopping\ndrinking. (Fig. 6)\nALCOHOL, WEIGHT & DIET\nDrinks are high in calories but\nempty nutritionally. Excessive\ndrinking can lead to obesity because\nalcohol calories cannot be stored by\nthe body in the same way as calories\nproduced by food. This means that\nif alcohol is consumed in addition to\na normal diet, alcohol calories are\nused by the body while food calories\nare stored as fat. If a person\ndecreases food consumption to\ncompensate for alcohol, then poor\nnutrition is a risk because alcohol\ndoes not contain the vitamins,\nproteins and other necessary\nnutrients present in real food. (Fig.\n7)\nAlcohol can also stop the body\nabsorbing and using vitamins\u2014\nespecially thiamine, other B vitamins and vitamin C. The\nresulting stress on the brain, liver\nand other organs prevents them\nworking properly. In general,\nvitamin deficiency affects a person's appearance, particularly the skin,\nand limits the body's ability to fight\noff infection.\nFig. 4\nTHE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON ADULT BEHAVIOUR\nnumber of drinks blood alcohol content Img/ I OOm!) usual effect on persons of average build1 pint of beer or\n2 glasses of wine or\na double whisky\n1.5 pint of beer or\n3 whiskies or\nhalf a bottle of\nwine\n2.5 pints of beer\n5 whiskies or\n5 glasses of wine\n30\n50\nincreasing likelihood of\nhaving an accident\nY increasing chee fulness, impaired judgement,\nloosening of inhibitions\nLoss of driving licence\nif caught\nnumber of drinks blood alcohol content| mg/100m l) usual effect on persons of average build5 pints of beer or\n10 whiskies or\n1 litre of wine\n150\n6 pints of beer or\nhalf a bottle spirits\nor 2 bottles of\nwine\n200\n% bottle spirits\n1 bottle spirits\n400\n500\n600\nt loss of self control;\nquarrelsome ness; exuberance;\nslurred speech\nstagger; double vision;\nloss of memory\noblivion, sleepiness\ncoma\ndeath possible\ndeath certain\nPage 12 FELIX November 25 1988\n\n"

ER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nA project to utilise 'underused space'\nCollege drafts plan\nfor health club\nThe College has drawn up draft\nproposals for a Health Club to be\nplaced opposite 'The Gardens'\nrestaurant under Southside Hall. It\nis hoped that the club will include\nmulti gym and weights facilities and\na solarium and saunas. If the\nproposals are agreed to as they pass\nthrough Union and College\nCommittees, construction work,\ncosting around \u00a3500,000, could start\nby the Summer Vacation.\nCollege Building Planning Officer,\nBrian Dennis, has drawn up a draft\nplan of the Health Club, to go before\nthe College's Finance sections and\nUnion and College Officials. The\nplans propose a conversion of the\npresent weights room into a multi gym area, and the installation\nof a new weights room in what is\ncurrently a large toilet area.\nWhen describing his reasons for\nthe plans, Mr Dennis said 'there is\na lot of underused space.' If\nimplemented, the plans would also\ninclude provision for a Sports Shop\nand a reception area and lounge.\nImprovements to the toilet and\nchanging facilities in the Martial Arts\narea above the weights room are\nalso planned. Mr Dennis hopes to\nsee a 'quality' development. \"There\nis no point doing things by halves'\nhe said.\nThe proposals include\nimprovements to the ventilation\nsystem in the area, which have been\nsaid to be poor.\nCollege Secretary, John Smith told\nFELIX that the College is hoping to\n'maximise the use' of the space\nunder Southside, currently used as\nJ i1%,i*>~ Lm\nKeep Fit fans look below for the health club\na weights area and toilet facilities.\nHe went on to say that the idea\ncame from last year's Athletics\nClubs Committee (ACC) Chairman,\nRob Gee.\nMr Smith said that the College's Finance section is currently making\n'financial projections', which he\nhopes will be available shortly. The\n'projections' will look at the possible\nopening hours of the proposed\nfacility, as well as staffing levels and\nthe possibility of a membership\nsystem. He said that he thought the\nclub -could be run in a similar\nmanner to the College's Sports\nCentre in Prince's Gardens\nalthough, he added, 'it is a very\ndifferent kind of facility.'\nIf the proposals receive a favourable response from the\nnumerous people involved, the\nCollege will take out a loan to fund\nthe project. Union President, Nigel\nBaker and Manager, Dave Peacock\nare keen to see the Union back the\nproject if it is acceptable to them.\nMr Baker told FELIX that he\nwould like to see the Union use its\nincome from the Harlington Gravel\nit owns or obtain a loan from the\nCollege to finance the plans. He\nadded that the Union would seek to\nmanage the club if the Union backed\nit.\nMr Smith said he thought that the\nquestion of management was\n'something to be decided.''\nballot on\nexam veto\nThe Association of University\nTeachers (AUT) may boycott\nexaminations, if a ballot of the\ntn ion's members agrees.\nThe union decided to ballot its\nmembers at an Executive meeting\nan Wednesday. Papers will be\ndistributed today with replies due\nby December 12. The result of the\nballot will be known by December\n14. If the ballot agrees, the union\nwill 'withdraw entirely from\nparticipation in any part of the\nexamination process,' from January\n9 1989.\nThe ballot comes after the\nUniversity Authorities Panel (UAP)\nailed to produce a pay offer at a nee ting on Monday. In a report\nr rom the AUT and the Committee\nof Vice Chancellors and Principals\n(CVCP), of which the UAP is a sub-committee, pay increases were\nagreed for December 1 1986 and\nMarch 11988. The report concluded\nthat a further increase would be\ndesirable by April 11988. This offer\nhas not been made.\nA spokesman from the CVCP said\nthat it had not been possible to make\nthe further pay increase, due to a lack of funding from the\nGovernment. The next increase for\nAUT members is due on April 1\n1989.\nIn a press statement on\nWednesday, the AUT said they\nwere 'seeking a reasonable pay\nsettlement for 1988 and a satisfactory 1989/90 negotiating\ntimetable.' They aim to receive a settlement in 1989 which will be in\nline with other public sector groups.\nThe AUT claims that academic\nand related staff are being\ndefrauded of 'their legit mate pay\nContinued on back page\nISSUE81925 NOV1988 "

    "content": "Booze\nFig. 5 Fig. 6\nHOW ALCOHOL LEAVES TIME TAKEN TO ELIMINATE\nTHE BODY ^ ALCOHOL\nSweat Glands\nALCOHOL AND STRESS\nBecause alcohol is a depressant\ndrug, it can act as a tranquillizer,\nreducing stress for moderate\ndrinkers. However, regular heavy\ndrinking can increase stress and\nnervousness when the drinker stops\nfor a day or two or when the body\nbecomes tolerant to alcohol's effects.\nThe danger in this is that the drinker\nma v be tempted to drink more and\nmore to overcome stress and\ntension.\nALCOHOL AND SLEEP\nAlcohol's tranquillizing properties\nmay help a person get off to sleep\nand may indeed be a less harmful\ntranquillizer than sleeping pills.\nAlcohol-induced sleep, however, is\nnot REM (rapid eye movement)\nsleep necessary to provide complete\nrest.\nALCOHOL AND\nOTHER DRUGS\nAlcohol interacts with many other\ndrugs, often producing a much\nstronger effect than expected.\nBarbiturates, tranquillizers,\nstimulants, antihistamines can all\nhave quite dangerous effects when\ncombined with alcohol. One or two\nbarbiturate tablets taken with three\nor four drinks can kill.\nPeople who both drink and smoke\nare at extra risk because alcohol\nenhances the action of cancer-producing agents such as cigarette\nsmoke.\nSEX\nMany people drink in order to feel\nsexy. Although there is some truth\nto the claim that people are more\nsexually aroused when drinking, the\neffect seems to be mostly\npsychological. In moderate doses\nalcohol can prolong the length of\ntime before a man reaches orgasm\nand at slightly higher doses it can\ninduce 'impotence' because of its\nmuscle relaxant effect.\nDAMAGE TO HEALTH\nIn the long term, drinking more\nthan the relatively safe levels of 14\nunits a week for women and 21\nunits a week for men can seriously\ndamage health. The throat, brain,\nliver, heart, pancreas, reproductive\norgans and stomach can all be\naffected by drinking too much over\na period of time.\nLiver disease is widely known to\nbe caused by alcohol, but research\nhas also shown links between\nalcohol and cancer, heart disease,\nbrain damage, and infertility. Foetal\nAlcohol Syndrome (or FAS) is a200 \u2022\nE150' mg/10(\n100 \u2022\nBAC\n50 \u2022\n\\ ^\n12 2a m4am6a m10am condition that occurs in babies of\nwomen who drank heavily in\npregnancy. The symptoms include\nphysical abnormalities and mental\nretardation. Even at fairly moderate\nlevels, however, drinking during\npregnancy may have harmful effects\non the foetus.\n'Alcohol dependent' or 'alcoholic'\nFig. 7\nHOW MANY CALORIES IN\nYOUR DRINK\nare terms used to describe a person\nwho drinks very large amounts of\nalcohol and who suffers very\ndisturbing and painful withdrawal\nsymptoms when he or she stops.\nThe only way he or she can avoid\nwithdrawal is to drink more,\ncreating a vicious circle, very\ndifficult to break.\nDRINK CALORIES\n1 pint of beer 300\n1 glass of wine 80\n1 gin and tonic 140\n1 whisky 90\n1 vodka and orange 130\n\u2022 Remember: 10,000 extra calories will produce 3\npounds of fat.\n\u2022 This means that Vk pints of beer a day for 2\nweeks could put on 3 pounds of weight.\n\u2022 Two gins and tonic a day for 5 weeks could fatten\nyou by 3 pounds.\nNovember 25 1988 FELIX Page 13\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\nWho Framed Henceforward\nRoger Rabbit\nCert PG, Odeon Leicester Square\nFrom December 2.\nTake one of the world's best\nproducers, Steven Spielberg, and\ndirectors, Robert Zemeckis; give\nthem 740 additional technical staff,\nthe backing of Disney's Touchstone\nPictures, and over \u00a320 million; add\na couple of the finest actors around,\nBob Hoskins and Christopher\nLloyd, and every Disney and\nWarner cartoon character\nimaginable.\nThe result is Who Framed Roger\nRabbit, as dazzling and entertaining\nas an v other film you can name. It\nopens with Roger co-starring in a cartoon with Baby Herman ('I 've got\nthe sex drive of a fifty year old and\nthe dinky of a three year old'),\nchasing around the un feasibly large\nkitchen of a typical cartoon house.\nThe film is spoilt by Roger's acting\nthough, the director calls cut and a stunning transformation to the real\nworld occurs. The effect is\nspectacular and a taster for the\nfollowing one hundred minutes'\njourney around Hollywood and\nToontown.\nEddie Valiant (Hoskins), a local\ngumshoe, is hired to obtain\nevidence proving the infidelity of\nRoger's wife Jessica ('I'm not really\nthis bad\u2014it's just the way I'm drawn'). He takes pictures of Jessica\nindulging in a game of p atta cake\nwith Marvin Acme, a local\nbusinessman, and these are shown\nto Roger in the hope that it will\nstraighten him up and improve his\nacting.\nWhen Acme is found dead, Roger\nbecomes prime suspect. Eddie\nWho could live with a man who\ntape records you every time you\ntake a pee, and styles the sounds of\nsex into steamy syn clavier\"' m phonies? That man is Jerome\n'\">v Ian McKellen) the semi-success tul musical innovator who's struggle out of lean times in love,\nlife and work forms the theme of\nAyckbourn's latest play.\nCandidates for his partner would\nhave to be pretty eccentric, just a little kinky or plain inhuman. The\nartist has to settle for the latter in the\nshape of NAN300F the demented\ndomestic dalek passed on by 'the\nman down the hall' because his wife\nhas long since departed their\nbugged boudoir, taking their only\ndaughter, and all his inspiration,\nwith her.\nJerome's scheming to win back\nd add v's favourite girl by passing off\nhis chaotic existence as a picture of\nhomely tranquility, with the aid of\nnaive escort girl and aspiring actress\nZoe, is funny in itself, and lays\ndown jigsaw-cut foundations for\nscenes of absolute hilarity in the\nsecond act. Here we see the lawyer,\nthe wife and child, Jerome and his\nnew found perfect partner (?!)\nengaged in classic Avckbourn farce.\nwinds up trying to prove his\ninnocence, and quickly regrets the\ndecision. They are aided by Delores,\nValiant's foolish lover, and begin a hopeless search for truth and\njustice. Close behind is Judge Doom\n(Lloyd), marvellously created as a purely evil creature and\nconvincingly played. The scene is\nset, the chase is on.\nThe details of the plot I found not\njust confusing but pretty\nunfathomable. It all gets explained\nat the end, the whos and whys, and\nmakes a strong social comment in a strangely amusing way. The film\nloses nothing for this complication\nhowever. It's about having fun.\nWhen Eddie reprimands Roger for\nshowing off in public while he's supposed to be in hiding he justifies\nit with a line which summarise s the\nentire move. 'It's alright, 1 made\nthem laugh. It's important to have\na laugh. Sometimes a laugh is the\nonly weapon we have.' A wonderful philosophy.\nMaturity is not about being\nserious. It's knowing when to be\nserious, and when to revert to\nchildhood. I can say unashamedly,\nI sat in a cinema full of kids, knee-high to Roger himself mostly, and\nlaughed with them at the funny little\ncartoon characters racing across the\nscreen. The sheer technical brilliance\nwas enough to fill me with awe and\na childhood passion I 've not felt for\na good many years. I loved every\nlast second.\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit is going\nto be the blockbuster movie of the\nyear and I can think of nobody who\nwouldn't enjoy it. Be sure to catch\nit and see what I mean.\nAndrew Clarke.\n'You do what like a rabbit?'\nThis tempting invitation to peek\nin at the creative artist at work could\neasily be sie zed on as an\nopportunity to interpret the work as\nautobiographical. The artist-as-voyeur metaphor fits perfectly, of\ncourse to Ayckbourn's own craft of\nplaywright, >ut is broad enough to\nstand for many creative disciplines.\nThe potential pitfalls of choosing\nthis subject must alwa vs be self-indulgence and conceit on the part\nof the writer yielding a mythical\nmaster-artiste surrounded by stage-prop supporting characters, thus\nproviding a rather crude device for\nfocussing our attention on the\ncentral character.\nIndeed McKellen might almost be\nthe author, trapped in the middle of\na maypole dance of his own cut-out\ncharacters strangely comes to life.\nUnusual economy of detail for these\ncharacters leaves us with a Sloane\nRanger, an ageing hippy, a City\nslicker, a bunch of brash brats and,\nonly moderately less human, the\nrobot.\nThankfully Jane Asher brings\nabundant humanity to her role as\nthe estranged wife, almost enough\nin fact to offer convincing competition to her husband's constant companion and lover; his\nart.\nSetting the artist's 'pad' in the\nanarchic bedlam of a 'rough streets'\ndistrict together with a disparaging\nreference to K il burn draws a paranoid middle-class chortle at the\n'urban jungle' clich e, but the net\neffect is to add harmlessly to the\n'c red' of our bohemian artist.\nAudio-visually, however, all credit\nto the designers of the moody set\nand to Yasmin Hasmi and Paul\nTodd's musical backbone to the\nwork.\nIn the end the sentimental shoot\nof a finale springs to suddenly,\nsucking emotional sap from a half\nprepared and shallow soil. The\ncontrast of this slow seduction and\nrapid climax is strangely post-ecstatic and ultimately a little\nunsatisfying.\nTo an understanding of its two\nthemes of love and creativity the\nplay contributes little, but it uses\nthem to good comic effect. The\nresult is not enlightenment, to be\nsure, but it is something more than\nthe word entertainment has come to\nmean. In the best sense of that word\nHenceforward succeeds, like all good\ntheatre, in striking out into the stalls\ninsisting, with its live presence, that\nit involves, even moves you. So\nallow yourself that luxury and go\nand see it: the after-dinner\nconversation from th.s one will be\nlight enough not to spoil your post-theatre Vindaloo.\n{Henceforward, by Alan Ayckboum is\nat the Vaudeville Theatre, nearest tube\nCharing Cross)\nMac\nPage 16 FELIX November 25 1988\n\n"

He is\nperhaps best remembered for his\nability to compose music whilst\ndriving. Many of his greatest works\nwere written whilst competing,\nincluding 'Karelia Suite', written on\na special stage of the RAC rally, and\nperhaps his most famous work,\nFinlandia composed whilst\ncompeting, successfully in the One\nThousand Lakes Tour of Finland.\nTonight, at 8pm in the Great Hall,\nImperial College Symphony\nOrchestra will perform Sibelius'\nViolin Concerto, arguably the most\ndifficult in the repertoire (composed\nduring the most difficult rally, ParisDakar). The soloist is Geoffrey\nSilver, former leader of the National\nYouth Orchestra of Great Britain\nand a second year maths student at\nIC. Geoffrey has never competed in\na rally, although, he was born in\nCarshalton, Surrey.\nAlso on tonight's programme are\nElgar's Symphony in A Flat and\nMussorgsky's Night on the Bare\nMountain.\nTickets are \u00a32.50, \u00a31.50 (students)\nand \u00a31.00 (in advance) and are\navailable from Orchestra members\nor the Haldane Library.\nBoxing Day\nWu Shu Kwan, the style practised\nby the Imperial College Kung Fu\nClub, is an extremely practical and\nformidable street fighting-technique.\nThe Wu Shu Kwan Chinese Boxing\nAssociation, which has branches all\nover the world, has organised a Freestyle Full-Contact\nChampionship in which senior\npractitioners of the style fight one on\none. The actual fighting technique\nis very similar to Thai Boxing,\ncombining normal boxing-punches\nwith kicking. The result is a fast and\nfurious fight which is exciting to\nwatch.\nThe tournament is to be held in\nSurbiton, Surrey, on Sunday\nDecember 11 at 2.00pm.

I accept, however, that the\nMaths department is entitled to\nexpress its own opinions on the\nissue.\nI am sure our readers are\nintelligent enough to make up their\nown minds.\nApathy. It is ironic that FELIX has\nnot recieved any comments on the\nsubject of the Alternative Prospectus\nwhich, after all was the issue at\nstake in the disputed editorial. It is\nsobering to realise that students and\nstaff show no interest in issues\nwhich should be seen to be\nimportant. They are far more\ninterested in technicalities and\ndefending themselves against minor\ncriticism than they are in issues such\nas the future of Imperial College or\nstudent loans.\nCredits.

Staff\nMeeting and Sherry 12.30 today.\nCouncil\nSketch In an attempt to prove just how\nwacky students can be it was\ndecided to hold Monday's Council\non a boat moored on the\nEmbankment. The boat, a heap of\nrust aptly named 'The President'\nhad never before experienced\nanything quite so tedious.\nThe President's report opened\nwith discussions on rent levels.\nNow th t College's Finance and\nExecutive Committee have decided\nto donate \u00a350,000 wardens 'national\nrents to the residence account. Hon\nSec Wendy Morris intends to Wimp\nout of the Union rent strike in the\nevent of College not diverting funds\nfrom foreign students into\naccommodation.\nThe meeting passed on to\ncriticising Christine Taig (Union\nPresident two years ago) for tying\nthe Union into a rent agreement that\nnow seems ludicrous. A motion was\nfinally passed recommending to\nCollege that Montpelier Hall be sold\nfor at least \u00a35M, with the money\nbeing used partly to purchase a cheaper, new hall for more students\nand partly to reduce the Fisher Hall\nmortgage. Unfortunately recent bids\nfor Montpelier Hall have not much\nexceeded \u00a34M. Good news at last; the Astroturf\npitch at Harlington has been\napproved by College. Better news;\nPresident Nigel Baker has been\ninstructed to try and get an\nagreement out of College as to\nexactly who owns what at\nHarlington and the Boat House and,\nmore importantly, exactly who the\nproceeds of the Harlington Gravel\nTrust belong to. He seems to have\nforgotten that the whole thing was\ninvestigated by Sydney HarbourBridge last year. Congratulations to\nNigel if he ever gets College to sign\nanything concrete on this issue.\nCalls for support, or otherwise, for\nthe ULU shutdowns to protest\nagainst the Poll Tax and DES Union\nsurvey were rapidly abandoned as\nirrelevant when Jelly pointed out\nthat the Poll Tax protest was in the\nmiddle of the Easter vacation. GUC\ndelegates were mandated to point\nthis out to the rest of GUC, as they\nobviously hadn't noticed. Tom\nYates, SCC Chairman, proposed\nthat as a positive alternative we\nshould hold a 'Stop the Poll Tax\nCarnival' and a 'Stuff the DES\nSurvey Carnival' (names courtesy of\nJelly). Council are always loath to\npass up the opportunity for a party,\nso watch out for the Chance to both\nenjoy yourself and be politically\n'right on'.\nand a 'state of your liver' testing\nmachine. All Council members have\nbeen mandated to use the latter, so\nyou will probably have the pleasure\nof watching Union hacks fainting in\nthe Bar as they realise they are going\nto die in three days time. There were\nalso calls for RCS President Steph\nSnell to use the machine last, as she\nwould probably break it. A motion\ncalling for all Council members to\nabstain entirely during the Week\nwas, strangely enough, defeated by\na large majority.\nDeputy President Chas Brereton\n(decorated for services to\ndeforestation) presented a mercifully brief report. The only\ncontentious issue was this desire to\nclarify whether Sabbaticals can take\ntime off during term time to pursue\nclub activities or work part-time (eg\nplaying the piano). For the sake of\npianos everywhere, Mr Brereton\nshould be told the answer is No.\nA verbal addition to Wendy's report was his view on non-attendance at Human Rights Week\nCommittees. He pointed out that\nthe Week was conceived by\nsomeone with a 'less than realistic\nview of the world'. As this person\nis now in Peru, Council felt safe to\nscrap the Week for this year.\nDuring discussion of a new House\nCommittee constitution, it was\npointed out that under the wording\npresented, each call of 'quorum'\nwould halve the membership of the\nCommittee. House Committee\nChairman Adrian Hicks conceded\nthis was a 'mistake'.\nAnd so, at last, to the motions.\nDuring the motion on investigating\nthe formation of a Union play group, a rumour circulated that the\ninvestigation was to be reported\nback on March 20th because Fi\nNicholas is expecting shortly after\nthat.\nSCC caused a stir by submitting\na motion advocating clubs holding\npersonal bank accounts containing\nUnion money. The vision of club\nchairmen and treasurers treating\nthemselves to dinner at the Savoy\nevery year (a privilege confined to\nthe Industrial Society) was enough\nto make the great and exalted of the\nUnion throw the motion out.\nIn another motion, Nigel and\nChas were mandated to read the\nWhite Paper on Student Top-up\nLoans. Nigel only had two\nquestions: 'How thick is it?' and\n'Who actually has to go and buy it\nfrom HMSO in Holborn?' Why not\ntreat yourself, Nigel, and do it\nyourself.\nThe best slang ing match of\nCouncil was saved until the end.\nNigel brought a motion of No\nConfidence in Sydney HarbourBridge (name changed in aid of\nComic Relief) as Council's representative to Governing Body\nand Finance and Executive (the two\nhighest College committees). This\nwas because Syd had missed F&E last Friday when his alarm clock\nfailed to go off. After Syd's passionate defence, Nigel was the\nonly person supporting his motion.\nMost of the rest of Council actively\nvoted against.\nAnd so, the myth of Union\ndemocracy lives on.\nAlcohol Awareness Week\nSlOe EFFECTS ? -VJUAT DO YO0 MfJAN\n\"SIDE EFFECTS*?

    "content": "Science\n7/VTHE\nNow that winter is closing in on us,\n1 thought it would be appropriate to\nwrite about energy. Several aspects\nof this subject appear in the news\nfrom time to time;. unfortunately\nthere isn't room to go very far here.\nProduction\nAbout 90% of the world's energy\nneeds are met by combustion of\nfossil fuels; the rest comes mainly\nfrom nuclear and also hydroelectric\nsources. Production and sale of\nNinety percent of the\nworld's energy needs\nare met by fossil fuels\nenergy is big business and is vital to\nall nations' economies. It is no\nsurprise to find that most developed\ncountries have large resources of\nenergy, and most underdeveloped\ncountries do not. There are some\nsignificant exceptions, particularly\nJapan, which is very short in energy\nresources. In Britain the importance\nof energy can be seen from the large\nbalance of trade surplus produced\nby the oil industry - about \u00a37 billion\nand the sales per year by British\nCoal (\u00a34 billion), British Gas (\u00a37\nbillion) and the CEGB (\u00a35 billion).\nWhenever the world price of oil\nincreases significantly, everyone\ngets very worried about the\nimpending energy crisis and what\nthey will do when the oil runs out.\nThese worries evaporate when the\nprice of oil falls again, as we have\nseen in the last few years, and\neveryone shelves their plans for\nproducing oil from coal, etc. There\nare probably reserves of oil easily\nsufficient for our lifetimes, but the\ntime will come when it is cheaper to\nuse coal than extract the oil from\nincreasingly difficult reserves.\nPollution\nNo form of energy is totally 'clean'.\nThe cleanest fuel is probably natural\ngas, but even that produces carbon\ndioxide on combustion, with its\nconsequences for the 'greenhouse'\neffect. Oil and coal produce even\nmore C02 for their energy output,\nand coal especially produces a lot of\nsulphur dioxide, a significant\ncontributor to acid rain. All fossil\nfuels when burnt also produce\nnitrogen oxides, but this depends\nmore on the method of combustion\nthan on the fuel. Nuclear energy\nproduces no atmospheric pollution,\nbut instead, of course, produces\nradioactive material. We could make\na significant reduction in carbon\ndioxide emissions by replacing all\nour fossil fuel energy supply by\nnuclear power stations, but the cost\nwould be prohibitive and the\nincreased risk associated with the\nincreased capacity may be\nunacceptable.\nRenewable Energy\nSo what about 'alternative' energy\nresources? The quantity of solar\nradiation incident on the earth is\nphenomenal, but it is very thinly\ndistributed, as are all renewable\nresources. For example, the annual\naverage solar energy in Britain is just\nO.l kW per square metre. Or to\nreplace just one nuclear power\nstation, we would need 150 square\nkilometres of solar panels. A similar\nenergy production from wind\npower would require 300 sixty-metre wind turbines in an area the\nsize of Birmingham. Renewable\nresources also tend to be somewhat\nunreliable. However, some\nrenewable energy resources are very\nviable, for example hydroelectric\nschemes. These generally require\nhuge capital investment, but will\nrun very cheaply for years. Some\nschemes have been very successful\nand some disastrous (eg in Brazil,\nFELIX 814).\nEfficiency\nWe could do a lot to conserve our\nenergy resources and reduce\npollution by using energy more\nefficiently. This entails both\nreducing requirements for heat in\nindustry and houses, and\nrecovering the heat released by\ncombustion more efficiently. It is\noften pointed out that the\ngeneration of electricity is very\nwasteful of energy, because for\nevery unit of electricity produced,\nsomething like 1.5 units of heat is\nthrown away. Schemes to recover\nNo form of energy is\ntotally clean\nthis heat, eg in district heating\nschemes, have usually not been\nvery successful. However, since\nelectricity can be used much more\nefficiently, the overall energy\nconsumption may be quite good.\nFor example, electric trains\ncompared to diesel trains,\nmicrowave ovens compared to gas\novens, electric lights compared to\ncandles, etc. Many advances have\nbeen made in recent years in the\nefficiency of combustion systems\nand in the transfer of this energy,\nlargely prompted by oil price rises\nin the 1970s. On the domestic scene,\nthe introduction of natural gas\nallowed a huge increase in the\nnumber of homes with central\nheating, with hardly any total\nincrease in energy consumption,\nbecause of the increased efficiency\nRenewable resources\ntend to be unreliable\nof gas boilers, compared to the coal\nfires they :argel y replaced. Even so,\ngas boilers are only up to 75%\nefficient, so a quarter of the gas vo u use is still wasted. Recent\nexperiments on the old Ascot water\nheater in my kitchen showed it to\nbe about 12% efficient.\nImprovements to boiler efficiency\nare constantly being investigated by\nBritish Gas, with features such as\ncondensing the water vapour from\nthe flue gases to recover the latent\nheat. This is easy with the relatively\nclean flames from gas, but much\nmore difficult with flue gases from\ncoal. Both the efficiency and\npollution emission of oil and coal\nfired systems can be improved by\nadding water to the fuel. In the case\nof oil, up to 20% water can be\nadded; the water helps the oil break\ninto smaller droplets, so improving\nmixing with air, it provides a source\nof OH radicals for the combustion\nreactions, and it lowers the flame\ntemperature, reducing the\nproduction of nitrogen oxides.\nAdding water to coal is not the only\nway of improving its combustion\nefficiency. British Coal are doing a lot of research into fluid is ed bed\ncombust or s.( Coal is ground into\nsmall particles and burnt in a vertically fast-moving stream of air.)\nThese have the advantage of being\nmuch smaller than conventional\nA quarter of the gas\nyou use is wasted\ncombust or s and because of the\nincreased turbulence and mixing of\nthe coal and air, the combustion and\nthe heat transfer to the steam pipes\nis more efficient. Another British\nCoal project is coal gasification for\npower generation. Here the coal is\ngas if i ed, the gas is burnt, passed\nthrough a gas turbine to generate\nelectricity and then preheats steam\nwhich is passed through a fluid is ed bed combust or where the rest of the\ncoal is burnt to produce steam for\na conventional steam turbine.The\nfeasibility of a2000 MW power\nstation using this technology is\nbeing investigated by British Coal.\nDounreay nuclear power station.\nPage 8 FELIX November 25 1988\n\n"

We soon\ndropped porridge from our culinary\nrepertoire.\nAfter 25 days of interviews and\nquestionnaires, we finished the\nsurvey and headed north to Hushe.\nWe had left ourselves almost 3\nweeks for the climbing part of the\nexpedition, and, with the help of\nTravel Dossier\nPakistan\nGetting there\u2014By air to Karachi\ncosts approximately \u00a3350 (by Gulf\nAir), to Islamabad \u00a3650 (BA and\nPIA). Travel Agents can sometimes\nfind cheaper flights but they will not\nbe direct. Book a seat early for your\nreturn journey to England towards\nthe end of August and in September\nas this is the busiest time of the year.\nRemember to keep PR250 for airport\ntax as you leave the country.\nOverland is difficult, as it involves\ntravel in Iran, but it is not\nimpossible.
