    "content": "ULETTERS;\nour\nPompous\ntwits\nDear Sir,\nI would just like to straighten out a few\nmisconceptions. As usual the pompous twits\nthat run Wellsoc have got it wrong. Although\nthe photo they pinched was used on a Private\nEye cover the speech bubbles were originally\nfrom Guildsheet. The 'invoice' was sent as a joke by myself and Luke Walker. I was\nmainly narked that no one even mentioned\nthe use of my cover to me, actually I am\nrather flattered they think it's that good.\nFinally I must point out that there is a difference between Guilds Union and\nGuildsheet. I have tried to stay at least\npartially independant of the Union. This is\nnot always easy and I very often find myself\nin the impossible situation where I am\nslang ed off by hacks and non-hacks alike. I pride m self in the fact that a lot of my friends\nare not Guilds hacks (some refuse to go into\nthe office in case it ruins their street c red!). Although I resigned as editor in the\nChristmas is s sue I have continued to produce\nGuildsheet due to lack of judgement on my\npart. I am now definitely resigning due to\nreasons of health, finance and work. I would\njust like to thank all those people who have\nsaid nice things to me while I have been doing\nthe job.\nCheers,\nMark Cottle\nSafety first\nDear Sir,\nImperial College is morally and legally\nbound to provide adequate fire extinguishing equipment in all Departments and many of\nthe residences.'We need the co-operation of\nstaff and students to maintain this vital\nequipment in working order.

The headlines\non the front page state 'Camborne go on\nRampage', and go on to insinuate that\nCamborne School of Mines students caused\nall the damage at RSM. The article also\nimplies that the student taken to hospital was\nalso from RSM. This is cat agori call y not true,\nas I am that person.\nI was hit in the face by a plate, thrown at\nme by a member of RSM. This was\ncompletely unprovoked. As a result, I received injuries to my right eye which\nrequired emergency treatment at a London\nEye Hospital. Thankfully I am now almost\nrecovered, and luckily there will be no lasting\nimpairment to my eyesight.\nIt was as a result of the plate being thrown\nthat the dinner erupted. CSM students\nnaturally objected to any other glassware or\nobjects being thrown. No one at CSM has any\nknowledge of the damage which your article\nimplies.\nOn behalf of myself and fellow students, I believe it is wrong to bracket all mining\nstudents as malicious vandals, due to the\nirresponsible acts of a very small minority.\nYours faithfully,\nJohn A Lee\nCamborne School of Mines\nDear Sir\nI have recently received a copy of your\narticle in FELIX, 'Cambourne on the\nRampage'. I feel that your report is both\nbiased and misleading.\nThere is no mention of the fact that it was\nan Imperial College (RSM) student who\nthrew the plate at the Bottle Match Dinner.\nAs a result of this a Camborne School of\nMines student, who was a guest, had to be\ntaken to hospital with glass in his eye.\nIt would seem to me from my viewpoint at\nthe top table, that Camborne student were\nrestrained in their actions. Whilst I do not\ncondone any acts of vandalism, I would put it\nto you that they were not entirely\nunprovoked.\nI think that your article misleads the reader\ninto thinking that all the damage was done by\nCamborne students. There is no evidence to\nsuggest this is true.\nThe majority of the Camborne School of\nMines students and the Royal School of\nMines students were impeccably behaved,\nand I feel it is libellous of you to tar us all with\nthe same brush.\nYours faithfully,\nN Kirk Adams\nStudent President\nCamborne School of Mines\nFELIX\nDon't look\na gift horse\nin the mouth\nThe proposals for re-developing the\nrefectories in the Sberfield building show that\nthe College is at i ast waking up to the\ninadequacies of the present system (page 5).\nStudents have been complaining about the\nrefectories from time immemorial. Indeed\nMr Mooney's catering was even described in\nThe Times this week as being of 'the stale bun\nand formica vintage'.\nIt would be churlish of us to oppose the\nspending of up to \u00a3500,000 on dragging the\nrefectories into the modern world.

The game\nstarted scrap pil y and it appeared\nthat most of our team had not\ndefrosted enough after the big\nfreeze. NPL took full advantage\nof our frigidity and after about 10\nminutes managed to score after a scramble on our line during\nwhich numerous offences were\ncommitted but all went\nunpunished. This indignity\nmanaged to thaw the team out\nand a swift counter attack was\nlaunched, with Dick Wellis\nmanaging to put the ball in the\nnet after another scramble on\nthe goal line. NPL were now\nsubdued although it still proved\ndifficult to get through their\ndefence (mainly because of its\nsheer size), but Dick Ellis\nmanaged to get a neat touch on a ball across the face of the goal to\nput us 2\u20141 up at half time.\nIn the second half IC's game\nwas much more fluid (ie\nunfrozen) although the defence\nremained solid, thanks to Capt\nChris Harris. The game was\nfairly even throughout most of\nthis half with few scoring chances\nfor either side.\nThe last goal come from Dave\nGott who picked the ball up on\nthe halfway line and ran the ball\npast all of the NPL defence (and\none or two IC forwards)\nknocking the ball in having\ncomprehensively beaten the\ngoalie.

    "content": "Bo's quickly ac hived notoriety when used\nby obviously politically motivated students in\na protest against the then Prime Minister\nRamsey MacDonald. On 30 October 1924,\nthe Daily Mail reported that 'adela pi dated motor car containing the life size effigy of Mr\nRamsey MacDonald was last night pushed\ninto Downing Street and left in front of No 10,\nthe premier's official residence'. It was either\ndone as a protest against a knighthood of a biscuit manufacturer or because 'Lord\nMacFarlane made a gift of a Rolls Royce to\nMacDonald'.\nThe car was christened Boanerges on 26\nNovember 1925 by HG Jenkins using a bottle of beer. The name Boanerges is said to\nhave Come from a book by Ian Hay which\nrefers to Boanerges, 'son of fire' though there\nis no record as to why a'dela pi dated'1909 Rover should be so named. It quickly became\nintegrated into College life, regularly\nattending rag and sports events.\nBut the students' affection for the Rover\nquickly turned to disenchantment when a rule change by the Veteran Car Club made\nBo ineligible for the Brighton run. So in 1934\nCity and Guilds union voted the princely sum\nof \u00a340 for a replacement. Two students John\nGarland and Dick Riggle bought the present\nBo from Lilleshall in Shropshire and towed it\nback to London. The replacement James\nand Browne appears to have been in better\ncondition than the Rover despite being seven\nyears older\u2014in 1933 it averaged 23 mph from\nLondon to Brighton while the Rover\naveraged only 20 mph.\nOld Bo was however not entirely out of\nfavour. On being sold to a( presumed)\nstudent Peter Maxwell in 1936, it\naccompanied the James and Browne on the\nBrighton run until 1939. It was also used as a track-marshall's car at the Crystal Palace\nrace track and was garaged there in 1939/40\nuntil the army requisitioned the track. With\nits owner at war, and no other garaging\navailable, it found itself flying the\nskies\u2014through the Ministry of Aircraft\nProduction's scrap collection programme.\nNew Bo\u2014the 1902 James and\ni Browne \u2014continued to be one of the\nj mainstays of College life, though surprisingly\ni there was no official Union financing for its\nHistory of\nthe College\nThe City and Guilds of London Institute for\nthe Advancement of Technical Eduacation\n\u2022was founded in 1878 by a number of Guilds of\nthe City of London in association with the\nCity Corporation.\nThe Institute placed in the forefront of its\nprogramme the establishment of 'a central\nInstitution or College for the advanced\neducation of those who had acquired\nsufficient knowledge of science or the arts to\nprofit by instruction in the industrial\napplication of these'. Various locations were\nconsidered before the Commissioners of the\n1851 Exhibition offered a site in Exhibition\nRoad at a peppercorn rent.\nThe foundation column of the Central\nInstitution was laid in 1881 by the President\nof the Institute, the Prince of Wales, later\nKing Edward VII. He opened the Institution\nin 1884. The first entrance examinations\nwere held in February 1885; students\nentered the College either by taking the\nexamination or by transfer from Finsbury\nTechnical College, which the Institute had\nset up in 1882.\nThe Central Institution was renamed 'The\nCentral Technical College' in 1983.\nThe object of the Institution was 'to train\ntechnical teachers, proprietors and\nmanagers of chemical manufacturers and of\nother industrial works, as well as mechanical,\ncivil and electrical engineers, architects,\nbuilders and persons engaged in our\nindustries'.\nThe creation of the Institution was seen as\npart of a strategy to educate young people to\nregain Britain's trading and manufacturing\npower which had been ebbing since the\nGreat Exhibition of 1851. Institutions in\nEurope and in the United states had been\nconcentrating on the higher education of\nengineers for thirty or forty years.\nIn 1907 the Government accepted the\nReport of the Departmental Committee of\nthe Board of Education which recommended\nthe federation of three institutions of earlier\norigin which had settled in South Kensington\nat the end of the nineteenth century. They\nwere to form one institution of the highest\nZZZZFEATUREH\nmaintenance; a3d levy was made on each\nmember of the College instead. But as time\npassed, Bo grew from being a students' car\ninto a much respected rare veteran car\u2014it is\nbelieved to be one of the first vehicles\ndesigned and built in Britain.\nDuring the 1940s Bo ceased to be a violate\nmascot to prevent any further damage being\nincurred. In fact this move began the life of\nthe present mascot Spanner, for in the past a spanner, being the largest tool available, was\nused as a defence against other colleges.\nBut that did not prevent Bo being stolen by\nSouthampton University in the 1950s. Such\nwas Bo's stature by this time, the theft and\nsubsequent recovery attracted national TV\nand radio coverage\u2014Bo also made the\nnewspaper headlines around the same time\nafter being caught speeding in the Brighton\nrun.\nIn recent years Bo has undergone\ntremendous refurbishment with its present\ncondition being better than for years.\nFollowing a desperate and apparently\nsuccessful appeal for money in The Central\n1976 (No 153), the throttle and advance\nretard controls have been repaired and the\nfoot brake adjusted properly. Bo can now be\ndriven by only one person, but the tradition\nof a kind of co-driver is unlikely to disappear.\nThe car now has a beautiful new maroon coat\nto match Guilds colours with the College\nshield painted on in cream.\nBo goes out as often as possible to join in\nwith union events, but outings are obviously\nlimited in deference to its age and value.\nBo's companion on the last three London\nto Brighton runs has been the curiously\nnamed 'Derrick', a1926 Ner-a Car acquired\nby J he Union in 1980.\nDerrick was made in Kingston-on-Thames\nin 1926 and powered by a350cc Blackburne\nside valve engine driving through a SturmeyArcher three speed gearbox.\nstanding for advanced technological\neducation. In 1907 the City and Guilds of\nLondon Institute became the City and Guilds\nCollege, a Constituent College of the new\nImperial College.\nWhen in 1953 the Government invited\nImperial College to lead the national attack\non the problem of providing more university-trained scientists and engineers the City and\nGuilds College took its share in carrying out\nthis operation. In 1965 Imperial College was\ndesignated by the Government as one of\nthree specialised institutions which received\nfinancial priority to enable the development\nand expansion of technical edu a cation programmes.\nIn 1957 the first new building of City and\nGuilds College, for Aeronautics and\nChemical Engineering, was opened by HM Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother; the last\nof the new engineering buildings, finished in\n1967, was an extension for the same\ndepartments. This marked the completion of\nthe rebuilding of the City and Guilds College;\nthe Electrical Engineering building was\noccupied in 1962, followed by Civil\nEngineering in 1963, while Mechanical\nEngineering was rebuilt in four stages\nbetween 1959 and 1965.\nFELIX Friday 1 March 1985 9\n\n"

The system identifies\neach bone in a digitised X ray and\nmakes a maturity assessment based\non the maturity of the individual\nbones.\nVery large scale integration\nThe three exhibits on this topic\nillustrate its importance.

Design on this\nsub-micron scale is so complex that\ncomputers are used to assist.\nComputing\nBritish Nationality Act\nWhen faced with legislation as\ncomplex as the British Nationality\nAct, a computer program is the\nobvious answer. Work is being done\nin expressing the Act as a program in\nlogic which can be 'interrogated' to\ndetermine its application in a particular case.\nHeart disease\nA total contrast is the use of\ncomputers to detect heart disease\nearly. Signal processing technology\ncan be used to resolve the complex\npatterns of body surface electro-cardiograms.\nKobler Unit\nMost robots are blind. The 'Wisard'\nimage recognition system seeks to\nput this right. The device on display\ncan distinguish between a smile and\nfrown on the person sitting in front its\ncamera.\nAeronautical Engineering\nWind tunnel\nIncreasing fuel costs make the\naerodynamics of vehicle design\nmuch more important. A new wind\ntunnel, specifically designed for\ntesting road vehicles, has just been\ncompleted in the Aero Department.\nThe test section measures 5 x10x30 feet and the tunnel is controlled by a dedicated computer which also\nprocesses the results.\nMechanical Engineering\nDesign engineering\nThe Mech Eng department runs a joint postgraduate course in\nindustrial design with the Royal\nCollege of Art. The fruit of one\nstudent's work is illustrated in the\ncovered motorcycle.\nArtificial joints\nThe bionics section of the department is busy developing\nartificial joints, ligaments and\ntendons. The exhibits outline the\nprogress of an elbow joint project.\nFELIX\n\n"

It seems that\nRonnie's repertoire is taking a distinctly perennial turn: the\nsame blooms come up year\nafter year. Blakey's line up\nwas the same too; featuring\nDonald 'Duck' Harrison on\nalto and sax ello, and Art's new\nright hand man, trumpeter\nTerence Blanchard. Impeccable artists all, but after all\nthe pre-publicity (this year is\nthe club's silver anniversary)\nand admission \u00a34 a head at\nstudent rate, I expected a little\nmore than jazz rep e to i reI had\nheard a year ago. A week at\nthe club had begun to jade the\nmusicians who were given\nprecious little time to warm\nup, playing two sets rather\nthan the usual three. Still the\nevening produced fine alto-ballad from Harrison\u2014though\nyou had to get in early to see\nit\u2014and some tight relieved ly unobtrusive drum work by\nBlakey, if a little uninspiring at\ntimes.\n\u2022 It would appear Ronnie\nseems to have taken an\naversion to us 'young people'.\nHis house magazine, issued\nfree on entry, delights in\npraising the merits of 'the\nveterans' whilst back handedly taking out the young people\nhe's supposedly trying to\nencourage. After BBC2's showing of 'The Long Night of\nLady Day', about the tragic life\nof Billie Holiday, Scott was\npleased to report a total sellout of all Billie's material at\nRag's Jazz Shop, Seven Dials:\n'It shows, doesn't it' he said,\n'That the media could play an\nimportant role in Jazz particularly among young\npeople fed on a sustained diet\nof rock and roll. But our music\nremains the Cinderalla of TV\nand radio'. For a man with his\nfinger on the world of jazz,\nthat's a pretty introverted\nthing to say. Take a walk down\nto the soul-clubs, Ronnie;\nlearn a thing or two: and ask\nyour friend Ray just who\nbought all those Billie Holiday\nrecords. Attitudes such as\nthese will kill off the Jazz\nRevival before it has even had\ntime to put a horn to its lips.\n\u2022 Not so the blues. Norman\nJew is on' s latest film, 'A Soldiers's Story' has taken off\nin the States (it has been\nnominated for Best Film, in\nthe forthcoming Oscars long\nbefore release over here), but\nmay well sink without a trace\nin Britain despite widespread\nSINGLES\nDavid Lee Roth: California\nGirls\nVan Helen's Rocker has\ngiven a remarkably faithful\nreproduction of this Beach\nBoys classic, but with an '80's style production, and superb 'I dig those gu u url ls' cries I think this could have at least\nas much success over here as\nit has in the states (currently\nno 8).\nStranglers: Let me Down Easy\nTaken from the excellent\nAural Sculpture album, this is\nperhaps a surprising choice\nfor a single, Overly moody, the\n'Men in Black' get more\nopaque with every new\nrelease. They go to an awful\nlot of trouble to basically say\n'I am knacker ed'. Prince and the Revolution:\nLet's Go Grazy\nOl' Prance has been getting\na lot of stick recently. Yes he's a prat. Yes, he's selfish. Yes,\nhe's hyped. But\u2014he makes\ngreat music. From the Purple\npress publicity. The film is\nbased on a three day\ninvestigation by Washington\nMilitary Police into the murder\nof a black US officer in an\narmy training camp in the mid\nWest. It is an exceptionally\nwell structured film, building\nsuspense perfectly and using\ndated theatrical production\ntechique s to provide a nostalgic fifties ambience to\nthe movie. The real strength,\nhowever, lies in Herbie Hancock's blues soundtrack\nthreading\" the whole movie\ntogether. Ignore the over clubs and the mimed lyrics, lie back\nand enjoy it for the cotton-picking blues it is.\n\u2022 On the fearsome side of\nfunk, Radio London's latest\nventure was to team up with\nCBS to provide a mam mouth concert at the Hammersmith\nOdeon called the New York\nJazz Explosion,( Tom Browne, Jean Craig, Lonnie\nListon Smith and xylophonist\nand MC Roy Ayers.).

    "content": "LFELIX\nWhenThingGoWrong - DonAdlington\nStudent Counsellor\nUniversity students are on the whole a stable\nand resilient lot, but very few of them are\nlikely to spend the whole of their student\ndays floating on a sea of calm tranquillity.\nThings go wrong sometimes. The kinds of\nthings that go wrong are as varied as human\nlife itself and students are in no way immune\nto the contingencies of illness, of broken\nrelationships, of loneliness and major\ndisturbances as to goals, value and meaning.\nNor, of course, are they immune from\nworries about money, accommodation and a multitude of other such mundane things\neither. Generally speaking, students'\nproblems do not in themselves mark them off\nfrom their con tempo ries outside university.\nWhat is special about the student is the\ndegree of impact which such problems can\nhave on his work. Academic work, with inbuilt time limitations, by common consent\nincreasingly intense, and demanding a sustained high level of intellectual efficiency,\nis peculiarly susceptible to the destructive\nimpact of anxiety and distress, whatever the\nsource. In this special sense therefore,\nstudents' problems are always urgent.\nIt seems to me that when things go wrong\nthe first thing to do is to talk about it. In one\nsense it doesn't really matter who you talk to,\nprovided that you're listened to, the chance\nacquaintance in a pub or at a party might do,\nor, more likely, a personal friend. People\nfrequently underestimate, and are\nsubsequently surprised by, the real relief\nwhich follows from sharing one's distress or\nworry with another person. In the nature of\nthings some students may turn as a matter of\ncourse to their parents, and indeed where a problem appears to have long-term\nimplications, most students will not feel at\nease until they have taken the family into\ntheir confidence.\nSometimes however, these informal\nsources of support may not be available, or\nsufficient, in which case it may be sensible to\napproach people in college who have an\ninstitutional responsibility for helping\nstudents. The most obvious person is the\nperso anl tutor, or the departmental senior\ntutor. Postgradaute students, and certainly\nresearch students are in a slightly different\nposition, but the principle ie that academic\nstaff have, inter alia, a pastoral role, remains\nthe same. Women students should be aware\nthat there is a senior tutor (Mrs\nCunningham, in the Department of\nComputing) specifically appointed to talk to\nthem, Hall and House wardens are another\ngroup of people who are easily\napproachable\u2014who would readily accept a first-line responsibility for discussing\npersonal problems.\nFor reasons which may or may not be\nvalid, students may in some circumstances\nfeel reticent about tak ng their difficulties to\nteach ng staff. The student-run Nightline\nservice offers an alternative source of help\nand support and besides being totally\nseparate from the college esta blis ment is\navailable when other people are not.\nSimilarly the Chaplains offer confidential\nhelp to all students of the college irrespective\noff religious all eg ien ce. There is not doubt\nhowever that the Health Centre and the\nStudent Services Office, are the two most\nobvious and conspicuous sources of student\nsupport outside Departments, and while,\nclearly, they have different and well defined\nobjectives, they have in common an express\nwish to be constructively helpful to the very\nlarge number of students who use their\nservices each Session.\nThe student counsellor is in a slightly\ndifferent (some would say privileged)\nposition, in that he is in principle employed to\ndo nothing else but talk to students. For this\nreason counsellors see far fewer students\nthan doctors or student services staff, and\nfor the same reason a counsellor's role is\nmuch less well understood. This is especially\ntrue perhaps, in a College of science and\ntechnology where a lot of students\u2014and\nsome of their teachers too\u2014tend to see\nhuman behaviour in rather mechanistic\nterms. This way of looking at things almost\nalways leads to over-simplification of\ncomplex situations because it ignores the\nfund amant tal fact that we live in a world of\nfeeling. What dominates our lives, what\nmotivates us, what stimulates us, what\ndepresses us, what sustains us, are feelings\nabout ourselves and about other people.\nWhen things go wrong for people, in any\nother than the most trivial matter, the\nopportunity of expressing feelings, and of\nhaving these feelings ac knowle ged by\nsomeone else, become important.\nCounselling is a technical activity then, is\nprofoundly concerned with the s alien ce of\nfeelings, of the emotional infrastructure of\nhuman life. It is also profoundly concerned\nwith honesty, and it is this, perhaps more\nthan anything else, which distinguishes a counselling relationship from other\nrelationships Counselling is nearly always\nfriendly, but it is not friendship. When we talk\nto our friends or our relatives we are often\nseeking the comfort of an endorsement of\nour views. We don't really welcome insightful\ncomment, analysis or motive, or any other\nhonest reaction, unless it happens to line up\nwith ideas about ourselves that we have a strong wish not to disturb. Such an aversion\nto the disturbance of our preconceptions is,\nof course, normal in everyday life. The point\nis however that at times of crisis it may be\nimportant for a while at any rate, to look\nbelow the surface of what is going on. It is this\ncomponent of honesty which gives\ncounselling its 'cutting edge', and which, by\nthe same token can sometimes make it a slightly disconcerting experience, though\nalways, I would hope, a supportive one.\nCounselling then is concerned with\nfeelings and with honesty. It is also\nconcerned with confidentiality. Discussions\nin my office are private, and I am not free to\ntalk to tutors, supervisors or indeed anyone\nelse about a student, unless the student\nhimself explicitly and fully agrees to it. One\nimplication of this is that from time to time I have to accept that students will choose to\nact in ways which would seem to me to be\nunwise or even potentially disaster o us. My\njob is not 'solving people's problems'\u2014it is\nhelping people to solve their own. In reality\nthe sources of anxiety and distress may well\nbe things which cannot be changed, and the\ntask of the individual may therefore be that of\nmaking a better shot at adapting to\ndifficulties, and thereby minim ising the\ndamage they may cause.\nIf there are thing you would like to talk\nabout I would be very glad to see you, and 1\nam easy to contact by phone on Internal\n3041, or by calling at my office in the\nbasement of 15, Prince's Gardens,\nim media tiel y next to Weeks Hall.\nDon Adlington in his Prince's Gardens\nOffice.\n4 Friday 1 March 1985 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Rowing to Victory\nSPORT]\nROWING\nLast weekend was another\nsuccessful one for Imperial\nCollege Boat Club. The novice-ranked squad, fresh from their\nrecent sud cc ess at Henly Fours\nHead (see FELIX passed)\nentered both the Fours and the\nEights division at the Burway\nHead. In the morning's race, two\nFours gained a first and a fourth\nplacing n the Novice category,\nthe first placed crew winning a set of new oars for their club\n(worth \u00a3400) which were\ndonated by a local manu fact ue rer More pleasing still was the\nabsolute placing of their crew,\nwhose time was faster than that\nof any in the three senior classes,\nbeing beaten only by (some) of\nthe Elite crews pre s nt. For the afternoon's race this\nwinning crew doubled up with\nfour fresh oarsmen to contest\nthe Eights division, where they\ncompleted the double by wining\nthe Novice shield. The overall\nplacing was again pleasing,\nallowing international coach Bill\nMason a wide choice of\nvanquished senior oarsmen with\nwhom to discuss the result.\nElsewhere, Imperial's own\nsenior crew gained a notable\nvictory when they won\nthe\u2014University of London Head\nrace hy 0.04 seconds. This was\nparticularly creditable since the\nsecond placed crew, Charing\nCross Hospital, had conceded\nno more than a length when\nbeaten by the Novice squad in\nthe Allom Cup last- term. Keep\ntelling us Bill\u2014it seems to work!\nPhoto: left to right:\nNigel Reynolds, Chas Belvens,\nEd Love, Peter Carle (cox) Jerry\nSutton (Who presented the\nblades), Dave Jackson.\nTABLE TENNIS\nThe inter hall table tennis tournament resumed in style on\nSaturday 16 February, with the\ntop three seeds of each of the five\nparticipating halls eager to\nuncover their astonishing skills.\nFalmouth's recovery from the\nbottom position deserves a special mention. Aided by the\nstunning performances of G Cant and N Ting, who won all\nfour of their respective matches,\nFalmouth managed to amass a total of 42 points, enough to put\nthem ahead of Selkirk and a whisker before Garden hall.\nOnly Lam Fung of Linstead came\nany close to beating G Cant who,\nincidentally, is also the current\nIC no 1!\nLinstead, however, in spite of\ntheir brave fight for the\nchampionship, managed to lose\ntheir top position to the Weeks\nhall.\nTalking about Weeks, two of\ntheir lethal players, O Davis and\nS Mansour, did particularly well\nto break a number of balls. As\none spectator aptly put it 'You\nwill have done well if you could\nsee the ball, let alone stop their\nsmashes'.\nIt is hard to pick out the man of\nthe tournament since there are\nseveral top players in the same\nposition. All Selkirk players,\nhowever, have shown every bit\nof their social responsibility by\nactively participating in the\ntournament,' without a table\nbeing available in their hall for the\npractice.\nSpecial thanks to A Warren\n(Weeks), J Downes (Selkirk), M Thompson (Falmouth), S Sadig\n(Garden), V Ibbotson (Physics\n1), and E George(Computing 1)\nfor their valuable help in the\norganisation of this sx citing tournament.\nHOCKEY\nSunday found a largely\ninexperienced and experimental\nside travelling down to\nPortsmouth for an indoor\ntournament and finding it selves in the tougher of the two groups.\nOur first opposition were\nFareham, national indoor finalist\nand eventual winners of the\ncompetition, and although they\nfound it difficult to penetrate our\ndefense at short corners was far\ntoo well drilled and ended up\ncomfortable winners. The\nsecond game, vs Camberly, was\ndisastrous and very little need be\nsaid about that game our third\ngames, vs OPCS saw- some\nres em balance of organisation\nreturn to the team, with IC\nunlucky not to win the game,\nsince OPCS equalise d in the last\nminute and IC missing a penalty\nflick, The game against the hosts\nteam, our fourth game was a low\nscoring, hard fought game with\nagain IC unlucky not to come out\nvictors. This non-winning streak\nwas at last reversed against\nPierelli who found our quickly\nimproving attack too much to\ncope with. McKormick (2),\nCraston (1) and Oliver (2) gave\nIC an comfortable 5\u20142 victory.\nOur final game, vs OE's was a very entertaining game, The\nopposition required 8 goals to\nqualify and thus the game turned\nout to be good humour ed and\nenjoyable. Stewart scored from a shot corner and had another\ndisallowed, whilst Dubenski was\nat the centre of the most amusing\nincident of the afternoon when\nhe was sent diving in an attempt\nto make a hand stop at a short\ncorner.\nThe team thus finished fourth\nout of seven in their group in an\nevent that could be seen as very\nuseful experience since the UAU\nindoor championships are\nrapidly approaching.\nCROSS\nCOUNTRY\nThe 37th annual Hyde Park\nRelay, hosted by the Crosscountry Club, took place in\nHyde Park on Saturday. The\nwarm weather made the race\nenjoyable for the spectators, but\nsome of the runners had\ndifficulty finding their way\nthrough the crowds. Predicably,\nLoughborough Students won\nthe six-man three-mile race for\nthe fourth time in five years.\nLondon Univerisity were eighth,\nwith Imperial's Graham Harker\nrunning his lap in 14:41, but\nImperial College's own team\nfinished well down the field. The\nLadies' race saw West London\nInstitute hold off Loughborough\nfor the team race, with London\nsixth. After the race Kelvin\nAcford and Clare Willson pulled\noff their five-loaves-and-two-fishes trick, and succeeded in\nfeeding the hungry masses\nthanks to all those who helped\nwith the race.\nMens\nLoughborough Students 83:48\nNewcastle Old Boys (Guests)\n84:08\nNat West Bank (Guest) 84:38\nBirmingham University 85:07\nWest London Institue 85:45\nFastsest Laps: Dave Clarke\n(Guest) 13:40\nDave Buzza (Loughborough)\nand Andy Bristow (Birmingham)\n13:43\nLadies (4x2 miles)\nWest London Institute 47:09\nLoughborough Students 47:51\nCambridge University 48:17\nFeastest Lap: Alison Hollington\n(Bedford College) 11:00 (course\nrecord).\nFELIX Friday 1 March 1985 17\n\n"

    "content": "CFEATURE\nA Spanner in the Works\nA brief history of Guilds Union and mascot ry By kind permission of the editor of The Central\nWithin City and Guilds College it has always\nbeen recognised that students need an\norganisation to help them develop socially\nand athletically. For this reason the union\nwas founded in 1898 by M Solomon and HC Armstrong, the first honorary secretary.\nThe Union, though, was not the first\norganisation to promote social events within\nCollege.. That honour goes to the Boat Club\nwhich in 1889 raced against RCS and RSM.\nThe Union itself come from the merger of two\nexisting clubs, the Chemical Society and the\nEngineering Society. Both of these had been\norganising work visits and talks for several\nyears. They united as a way of extending\ntheir programmes.\nFollowing this amalgamation, the Union\ngrew rapidly until the start of the First World\nWar. A gazette was produced which featured\nstudents' opinions and stories. They had\nrugby and football teams who played against\nother colleges. Students held debates and\nthey even had an annual dinner in the\ndrawing office.\nRag as a method of raising money was not\nstarted until the 1950s, but in the 1900s, students still organised rag events at major\nsporting events. In 1910, the MorningLeader\nreported students arriving at an RCS v Barts\nHospital rugby match in pyjamas.\nThe First War changed the direction of the\nunion's development. It resulted in a cut in\nthe number of students and as a result most\nof the traditional events could not take place.\nThis lead to changes. First, Imperial College\nUnion which gained a building in 1911,\nactually started to organise social events as a method of pooling resources. Second when\nthe war ended many new social events, which\nhave lasted to the present day, were\norganised.\nOn the social side Freshers' Dinners,\nDinner and Dance and Carnival originated in\nthe early 1920s. However Carnival today\nbears little resemblance to what it was then\nwhen a jazz band followed a fancy dress\ndinner. During the same period the Links and\nXXI Clubs were also formed.\nMorphy Day first too d place on 25 March\n1920 with Mines beating Guilds after the\nGuilds No 5 caught a crab. But it wasn't until\nthe 1930s that rag on the river banks\nseems h to have started. The Phoenix then j reported complaints about noisy hooligans I on the river bank.\nStudents in the thirties fell into two distinct\ngroups . A E Berry, who was the President in\n1933, described it when he said there was\n'work and brown-bagging on the one hand\nand women on the other'. This was partly\nbecause of the long distances many students\nlived from College and partly because many\nof the poorer students could not afford to\nkeep up an active social life.\nBy 1939, the social and sporting calendar\nresembled that of the modern union in many\nways. Guilds had even gained a second\nmascot, a set of pawnbrokers balls painted in\nCity and Guilds colours.\nThe Second World War again lead to a reduction in the number of students. But\nunlike the First War, there was no significant\nchange in the number or type of social events\norganised through the union. After the war,\nhowever events began to change slowly with\nthe trends. Pop and rock replaced jazz as the\nmusic of the day and 'hops'and later 'gigs'\nwere introduced.\nCarnival too changed, with the fancy dress\nand then the dinner itself being dropped. In\nrag, tid d ley winks and carol singing became\nrecon gnis ed as fund raising methods and\nwomen broke down one of the male bastions\nby being allowed to attend Freshers' Dinners.\nThese factors served to form the union\nSocial Calendar as it appears today.\nSignificantly, union activities have changed in\nthe 1980s as the students have struggled to\npull College out of the first half of the century.\nThe admission of substantially more women\nand their interest in the affairs of the union\nhave improved the standard of events.\nToday's calendar begins with a series of\nFreshers' Dinners followed by Carnival\nduring Rag Week and Bo's traditional run in\nthe London to Brighton vintage car race.\nDinner and Dance starts off the spring term\nwith activities tailing off during the year as\nexams loom. Scattered through the year are\nrag stunts around London, union meetings\nand rugby sevens and soccer 6s festivals.\nNearly 65 years have passed since City and\nGuilds Union first acquired a special\nstudents' car, or 'motorised mascot'. In that\ntime, Boanerges or 'son of fire' has changed\nits body once and its colours more than a few\ntimes. The principle of Bo remains\nunchanged\u2014that the car should be a focus of\nunion social and sporting activity and should\ntake part in the annual London to Brighton\nveteran car race which takes place each\nNovember. Bo' has ony failed to complete\nthe run twice in the last 50 years.\nNon eligibility for the run saw the demise of\nthe first motorised mascot, a1909 single\ncylinder Rover. The Rover was first acquired\naround 1920 when it is believed to have been\nabandoned by South African students\nfollowing a motoring holiday in Scotland.\nBo's first task was to assist in the capture of\nPhineas, the University College mascot,\nthough the result of this jaunt goes\nunrecorded.\n8 Friday 1 March 1985 FELIX\n\n"
