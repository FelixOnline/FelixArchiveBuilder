    "content": "science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n10 felix Friday 16 May 2008\nScience\nScience Editor \u2013 Ed Henley\nSimon Singh, author, science journalist, and Imperial alumnus, speaks to Felix about his new book\nSimon Singh recently got in contact\nwith Felix, mentioning he'd got a new\nbook out, \"Trick or Treatment? Alternative Medicine on Trial\", which\nhe'd co-authored with Edzard Ernst,\nand asking if we wanted an interview.\nNaturally, we leapt at the chance, which\nresulted in the following conversation,\noutside a Richmond pub on a sunny afternoon last week.\nIt\u2019s very informative - I\u2019ve picked\nup a lot of things I\u2019d not twigged,\nsuch as chiropractice being\ncompletely different from what\nchiropodists do\u2026\nI think that\u2019s an important point: I sat\nin on a lecture for some trainee GPs \u2013 I\nsurveyed them before the lecture, and\nit was quite clear that half of them had\nno real idea what homeopathy was \u2013\nthey thought it was to do with herbal\nmedicine \u2013 they didn\u2019t realise it was\njust sugar pills. On the one hand, GPs\nshouldn\u2019t hand out homeopathy, but\non the other, they will encounter patients who will say \u201cOh, I\u2019m thinking\nabout this \u2013 what do you think about\nthis\u201d. You say you learned a lot reading this book, I think GPs could too,\nbecause alternative medicine, like it or\nnot, is an area they\u2019ll come across again\nand again.\nHow did this book come about \u2013\nwhen did you meet Edzard Ernst,\nand where did your personal\ninterest come from?\nAlthough I started off as a physicist, I\nthen went off to become a TV journalist and an author and so I skip about\nall over the place \u2013 from pure maths\nin Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem to cosmology in the Big Bang to cryptography\nin The Code Book. So in a way it\u2019s not\nsurprising that I skip over to alternative medicine, except that it\u2019s very different from maths and physics.\nThe way it started was that I\u2019d heard\nof people using homeopathy to prevent\nmalaria, and I thought this cannot really be true. I know for a fact that homeopathy\u2019s just sugar pills and that of\nall the alternative therapies it\u2019s the one\nthat we know just doesn\u2019t work \u2013 both\nfrom a theoretical and an experimental\nbasis. I think an important point of the\nbook is that we\u2019re not anti alternative\nmedicine, we\u2019re just pro-evidence, and\nsometimes we\u2019ll embrace an alternative treatment, and in other cases we\nwon\u2019t; homeopathy\u2019s one we absolutely reject. Having heard these stories about malaria, I thought it would\nbe good to do a bit of a survey, and so\nI worked with a young graduate, who\nwent to ten different homeopaths - it\u2019s\none of the stories we tell in the book.\nBecause I\u2019m not a specialist, I collaborated with some tropical medicine spe-cialists. They said you should say this\nwoman\u2019s going to West Africa, where\nthe most serious cases are. I double-checked with Edzard, as I knew he was\nthe world\u2019s first Professor of Alternative Medicine, to check if there was any\nevidence homeopathy could be used to\navoid malaria. That\u2019s when I first met\nEdzard, and when I first became aware\nof how scandalous what\u2019s going on is\n\u2013 that ten out of ten homeopaths were\nwilling to treat this young lady, sending\nSingh on alternative therapies\nher off to West Africa unprotected.\nThat\u2019s when I thought: hang on \u2013\nthere\u2019s something here that needs to\nbe written; for the public. Even people\nclose to me \u2013 members of my family \u2013 have used homeopathy. They\u2019re\ngood parents, smart people, and if\nthey\u2019re turning to homeopathy, there\u2019s\nclearly a public education thing going\non here, as well as a fascinating history\nas to how homeopathy emerged, how it\ngrew, and what\u2019s going on in the minds\nof people who are spending money and\ninvesting hope in therapies which don\u2019t\nwork. That\u2019s when it all came together,\nduring the homeopathy study, meeting Edzard and realising he\u2019s spent 15\nyears studying this and writing a hundred academic papers, but wondering\nwhether his message was getting out to\na wider audience.\nThough you\u2019ve worked in many\ndifferent areas as a science\njournalist, this was your first\nbook-length piece in this sort of\narea. How was the process of\ncollaborating?\nIt worked incredibly well, much better\nthan I could have hoped for. There are\nnightmare scenarios where authors fall\nout with each other. But this was utterly painless, for a variety of reasons.\nOne of them is that Edzard\u2019s a good\nwriter \u2013 he\u2019s written columns, articles\nfor the public \u2013 so there were sections\nwhere I\u2019d say \u2018Can you have a go at this\u2019,\nso he\u2019d send me the material, and I\nmight go away and reshape it, reword\nit, and shorten it a bit but he always\ngave me stuff that was already read-able. And in other cases, I\u2019d say \u2018I want\nto write a section on herbal medicine\nand I\u2019m particularly interested in the\nsafety aspect. Can you send me some\nmaterial?\u2019 And he\u2019d send me essentially\na dossier of all the most important ma-terial. I\u2019d read outside that too, but he\nwould give a good starting point.\nAnd perhaps the most important\nthing is that we always said our conclusions about particular therapies would\nalways be based on the scientific evidence \u2013 we\u2019re not writing a book about\nwhat food we like \u2013 we\u2019re looking at\nwhether or not a treatment works, and\nthe way you do that is through a scientific trial. Science is never as cut-and-dried as people might think it is \u2013 it\u2019s\nalways open to slight interpretation,\nbut at the end of the day it\u2019s quite clear\nwhether or not acupuncture is effective for eczema, or is there adequate\nevidence that it\u2019s effective.\nI think the only area where we could\nhave had disagreements, and it\u2019s a really interesting area, is on the placebo ef-fect. We could have said \u201cHomeopathy\nhas no pharmacological effect in and\nof itself, so why does it work, why do\npeople think it works?\u201d Well there are\nvarious reasons \u2013 one is they take them\nwhen they\u2019re at their worst, so they can\nonly get better; they take them when\nthey\u2019re already taking conventional\ndrugs, which may help them, yet they\ncredit the homeopathy; they think it\nworks because of misleading things\nthey read in the press. And the body\nheals itself. So if you have a cold, with\nhomeopathy you\u2019ll get better in 7 days,\nwithout it you\u2019ll get better in a week,\nbut again you\u2019ll credit homeopathy.\nBut one of the reasons is the placebo\neffect \u2013 the sheer thought of taking a\nremedy which you think will help you\nwill have some positive effect. We explain the placebo effect is incredibly\npowerful, and clearly of benefit to pa-tients. So even if homeopathy is just a\nplacebo, if a placebo is generally bene-ficial, what\u2019s wrong with homeopathy?\nThat\u2019s a very powerful question we can\nget to. The problem in the debate is\ngetting homeopaths to agree it\u2019s just a\nplacebo in the first place! If we can get\nthat far there\u2019s an interesting debate\nas to whether or not we should use\nplacebos. Some people would say we\nshould - it provides an instant benefit\nat relatively cheap cost for people who\nhave otherwise untreatable conditions\nlike chronic back pain. But Edzard and\nI agreed that we would not want to go\ndown that route.\nThey\u2019re interesting, the reasons\nyou raise as to why you think\nthis is unethical, that the ends\ndon\u2019t justify the means. You say it\ndevalues medicine\u2026\nYes, it encourages irrationality; it\u2019s a\ngateway to people who think well if homeopathy works for my cold, maybe it\nwill help for my malaria protection.\nAlso, it encourages a culture of lying \u2013\nif homeopaths are allowed to lie to us,\nare big drug companies? Who else is\nallowed to lie to us?\nAnd why on earth would you have just\na placebo when you can have a real\nmedicine plus a placebo: if you have a\nback pain Ibuprofen has a real effect as\nwell as the placebo.\nAnd the more we run down conventional drugs (which admittedly aren\u2019t\nperfect) the more we remove their placebo effect, and stop their real effect.\nThis raises a few issues - as you\npoint out, alternative medicine\nis attractive to many because of\nits individual approach, which\nmaximises the \u201ctherapeutic\nrelationship\u201d. Has this effect been\ninvestigated?\nYes, studies have shown that if a doctor\ngives you medicine personally, rather\nthan a prescription, this enhances\nthe placebo effect. There are probably things conventional medicine can\nlearn from alternative therapists. But\none of the ways you elicit the placebo\neffect is purely through time. I had my\nfirst acupuncture session recently \u2013 a\nSimon Singh: if you've not read his previous books (e.g. Fermat's Last Theorem), you've missed out on some exceptional science writing. Change\nthis today \u2013 go pick up a copy of Trick or Treatment? Alternative Medicine on Trial. Or, if you're feeling lucky (punk), try out our competition\nEdmund Henley\nScience Editor\n\n"

Copyright \u00a9 Felix 2007.\nLOLCATS\nLOLCATS\nOF\nTEH\nWEEK\nOF\nTEH\nWEEK\nConcerns have been raised this week\nby a Felix reader over the misleading\nuse of Imperial College\u2019s name by several alternative medical organisations.\nThe Centre for Homeopathic Education was incorrectly listed as being\nbased at Imperial College London by\nseveral websites, including worldho-meopathy.org and worldhealthnow.\ncom. The address given, however, is in\nIslington, a part of London where no\nImperial College sites exist.\nFurther confusion was caused as several homeopaths cited Imperial College London as the institution at which\nthey studied homeopathy. The Bi-Aura\nfoundation said of honorary member\nJayney Goddard: \u201c[she] studied for over\nfive years at Imperial College.\u201d With no\nrecord of Jayney Goddard gaining a\ndegree at Imperial College, these comments are questionable at best.\nIn an email to Imperial College alumnus Simon Singh, she later clarified her\nrelation to the College, saying that \u201cmy\nhomeopathy college was only based\nthere at the time\u201d. However, these comments are equally misleading.\nIn the past, the Centre for Homeopathic Education has booked rooms\nfor classes on Imperial campus, allowing their graduates to misleadingly\n(though semantically accurately) claim\nto have studied \u2018at\u2019 Imperial College.\nThe London College of Clinical\nHypnosis (LCCH) is guilty of a similar\noffence. The LCCH runs a weekly Diploma Course in the Skempton Building; with this week\u2019s lessons scheduled\nfor Saturday 17th and Sunday 18th at\n10:00am in Lecture Theatre 201.\nCollege has contacted the homeopathic sites that were claiming to be\nbased at Imperial College and they\nhave agreed to cease using Imperial\nCollege\u2019s name. The LCCH, however,\nhas not yet changed its information\nwith many Clincial Hypnotists citing Imperial College as their place of\nstudy. This incident raises questions\nabout who can book rooms at Imperial\nCollege and how efficiently the College\nsafeguards the Imperial brand.\nIn the meantime, however, if you\u2019re\nfed up with Geology or MechEng, for\na measly \u00a32,500 you could have a Diploma in Clinical Hypnosis, \u2018from Imperial College.\u2019\nKadhim Shubber\nHomeopathy in action.

The recording first\ncame to light on a website aiming to\nreveal supposed truths about Kingston\nUniversity\u2019s lack of ethics and below-average teaching.\nThe Survey is sent by post or email\nto final year undergraduates in the UK\nand aims to be a feedback tool, measuring the quality of a course from undergraduates\u2019 points of view. Theoretically, this anonymous poll is meant to\nbe an accurate barometer of a student\u2019s\nopinions regarding his or her course.\nThe recording on the protest website,\nhowever, comes as somewhat of a blow\nto the credibility of results gathered. In\nthe recording, Dr Fiona Barlow-Brown\nof the university is heard blatantly trying to influence the students through\na sly form of intimidation. The lecture\nmakes mention that these surveys\n\u201cfeed in\u201d to league tables and rankings.\nShould Kingston be poorly placed in\nnational league tables, employers will\nbe led to believe students\u2019 degrees\nare \u201cshit\u201d rendering them essentially\nunemployable.\nAs a result of this, students are told\nto artificially inflate the scores for each\nof the twenty-two questions posed.\n\u201c... If you think something was a 4, my\nencouragement would be, give it a 5\u201d,\nsays the Kingston academic to a lecture room full of students. In response\nto national media coverage of the inci-dent, the university\u2019s Vice-Chancellor\nhas called this an \u201cisolated incident\u201d\nand that the lecturer\u2019s comments were\n\u201cinappropriate\u201d.\nThe story was picked up by IC news\nwebsite, Live! (live.cgcu.net) and\nsubsequently by the BBC, The Daily\nTelegraph and The Times. This has\nprompted an escalating number of\ncomments being sent in to a variety of\nnews websites and publications. According to the BBC Education website,\nstudents across the country have come\nforward to tell their tales of how their\nown universities have been employing\nsimilar conniving tactics in order to ultimately increase their standing.\nTheNSSsurveysareheavilyweighted\nin both the Guardian\u2019s and The Times\u2019\nleague tables. As a result, universities\nwho do not less-than-amicably \u2018force\u2019\ntheir students to give glowing reports\nof their teaching will invariably be\npushed down the rankings. For the\npast decade, Imperial has consistently\nbeen in the top three or four in the\ncountry. In this year\u2019s Guardian rankings Imperial placed in sixth behind\nthe usual suspects, but also Warwick\nand St Andrews.\nIt is unclear whether this catastrophe will impact assessments for future\nleague tables.

But what I got in return was\nbeing stuck in civil strife; being reduced\nto having only $7 in my pocket; brib-ery; and having to escape the country\nby taking a boat past armed gunmen.\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo\nwas a country that instantly caught my\nimagination. Precariously straddling\nthe line between extreme lawlessness\nand raw livid excitement, one doesn\u2019t\nreally know whether they should hop\nonto the next motorcycle taxi to try\nand overland it to capital Kinshasa\nacross vast jungles, armed militias and\nnever-explored terrain; or whether\nthey should cower in the toilet at the\nborder upon entry and wait for the foreign office to send a rescue helicopter.\nThis country has so much to offer -from active volcanoes and undiscovered wildlife to bona fide pygmy villages and a surprising amount of good\ninternational cuisine! I did not spend\nlong enough there to savour everything but one thing I did do, which was\nalmost a life-changing experience, was\nto visit the Highland Silverback Gorillas of the Zaire basin.\nTaking a bumpy 3 hour journey into\nthe Virunga NP, my guide - a local man\nnamed Kennedy - and I ventured into\ndense pristine rainforest. Deep lush\ngreen in colour and truly stretching as\nfar as the eye could see, this was also\nrebel territory; and the regular checkpoints as well as gunmen all along the\nroad constantly imposed this on us.\nThese were ex-soldiers under the command of General Laurent Nkunda, a\nformer army General turned rebel.\nAs we drove on into Virunga, our\njeep nearly ran over a young kid who\ndecided to step into our vehicle\u2019s path\nat the last second. A rebel soldier who\nwitnessed this caused an uproar and\ndemanded that the child\u2019s mother be\nbrought to him. When she appeared,\nhe arrested her on the charge of disturbing foreigners and being negligent.\nDespite our protests he demanded a\nminimum 2 dollar bribe for her release,\nand therein I think he exposed the real\nmotivation for the rebellion.\nPoverty was clearly rife and the difference between the DRC and Rwanda\nor Uganda was astounding. Within my\nfirst 2 days there I was able to compare\nthe DRC to towns in these neighbouring states, a mere 4-5 kilometres away,\nand see the stark differences. They had\nthe ability to look after their people,\nprovide a much better infrastructure\nand even protect their Gorillas more\nrobustly. In the Congo, roads were an-cient; small weak children begged for\nempty bottles and pens; and the park\nrangers were totally clueless. There was\nno local produce here and all goods\nwere imported from Uganda; and this\nwas the most developed region in the\narea! I could almost feel the gripping\ndesperation of the people here.\nUpon arrival at the gate of the Gorilla sanctuary, Kennedy and I were\ngreeted once again by rebels. Initially\n20 felix Friday 16 May 2008\nout with our machetes and AK-47\u2019s,\nwe knew roughly where the Gorilla\nfamily group were, but tracking them\nwas still pure exhilaration. Any bird\nor insect that moved fooled me into\nthinking that a Gorilla was upon us,\nand made me simultaneously tremble\nwith expectation and lock my limbs\nin full photography posture, copiously\nextending my zoom lens.\nAlthough these jolts of unjustified\nexcitement eventually smoothed out,\nthe feeling of actually coming across\nyour first Gorilla is out of this world.\nAs we unwittingly got closer, I heard\nthe first surefire sounds of Gorilla ac-tivity. It was the delicate patting of the\nhuge jaws of one of these gentle beasts.\nNext came a huge crash as it broke\ndown a tree, followed by the sighting\nof rustling leaves. I had to look hard initially amongst the tight undergrowth\nbut was then able to spot a massive jet\nblack form feeding.\nI couldn\u2019t see its face as it had its\nback to us, but then suddenly upon noticing us it turned 180 degrees. In an\ninstance it stepped out into the light,\nstopped eating and just gawped at us\nin amazement for a precious few sec-onds. Although I took plenty of photos\nof this moment, I had to force myself to\nstop and marvel at the situation.\nThis was one of the rarest species on\nthe planet, numbering only 700, and I\nwas lucky enough to see it and interact\nwith it in its natural habitat. How many\npeople get to do that!? Our group were\nonly humble guests in the home of\nthese majestic creatures and the onus\nwas on us to show them the utmost respect here.\nAs we stood in near paralysis, new\nmembers of the family group also ap-proached. First came the children, cu-Poverty and lava structures in Goma, DRC\nI felt frustrated that I would have to\ndeal with these guys and see the Gorillas under their jurisdiction, but I soon\nlearnt from Kennedy that the defunct\npark rangers had abandoned their\nposts a long while ago and in fact these\nrebels had defended the Gorillas with\ntheir lives during the recent bouts of\nconflicts.\nThe expressions on their faces made\nit clear that I had to tip them as handsomely as I could. After some reflection I came to the conclusion that\nmaybe they deserved this, having seen\ntheir poor condition and compared it\nto the much better-off Gorilla rangers of Rwanda next door. I was not too\ncomfortable, though, with the knowledge that my money may be used to\nfund the rebel activity, but Kennedy\nassured me otherwise.\nAs expected, rebels appeared in their\ndroves when I agreed to pay them to\nescort me through the battle-hardened\nVirunga forest towards the Gorillas. This was a much less professional\nservice than the one in Rwanda but\nwas consequently a lot cheaper and\nless restricted.\nI cannot emphasise enough the sheer\njoy of the next part of the experience\n\u2013 approaching the Gorillas. As we set\nOverlanding it on a motorcycle taxi\nThe people of Congo\nSelf explanatory\nThe headquarters of MONUC in Goma\n\u201cthe feeling of\nactually coming\nacross your first\nGorilla is out of\nthis world\u201d\n\n"

I\u2019ve deliberately\navoided all alternative therapies because I shouldn\u2019t base the conclusions\nin a book from my own personal experiences \u2013 how arrogant would that be of\nme to say acupuncture worked for me,\nso everyone should use it? So it was my\nfirst session, and it was an hour long \u2013\nsomeone talked to me, held my hand,\nseemed to do some level of diagnoses.\nFor half an hour, I had acupuncture,\nfor 20 minutes of that I lay down in a\nquiet room, with music playing gently,\nfor the last 10 minutes I had a head\nmassage. It\u2019s an hour long procedure,\nwhich probably cost around \u00a350. Now\nif you can invest that kind of money,\nyou\u2019re bound to get a placebo effect,\nbut unfortunately money\u2019s always going to be limited, which is why, I\u2019m very\nhappy to say, we can\u2019t waste money on\nunproven therapies.\nIs alternative medicine on the\nrise?\nYes, undoubtedly, increasingly there\nare all sorts of weird and wonderful\nthings on almost every high street \u2013\nwhy is this? One reason is we\u2019re an affluent society, we have money to pamper ourselves and give ourselves the\nillusion we\u2019re helping ourselves. When\npeople have a real crisis \u2013 breaking\na leg \u2013 they go to A&E. Alternative\nmedicine caters for these diseases\nwhich annoy us, where people get frustrated with mainstream medicine, say\ncolds or back pain, where mainstream\nmedicine has nothing to offer. And it\u2019s\npartly about mainstream medicine\u2019s\nlack of sensitivity to the public, and the\nway a minority of doctors treat their\npatients.\nBut I think the main driving force is\nthe mainstream media \u2013 in any Sunday\nsupplement you\u2019ll see articles about\nthe benefits of crystal therapy, or \u201cMy\nReiki guru\u201d. And if you\u2019re reading that\nyou\u2019ve got to think there\u2019s something in\nit. And you look across the street, and\nBootsissellinghomeopathy.Bootssells\nmedicines that help me, surely therefore homeopathy must help me, otherwise why would they be allowed to sell\nit. Neal\u2019s Yard, just last week, were very\nheavily criticised by the MHRA for\nselling a homeopathic remedy which\nclaimed it could treat malaria. So all of\nthis stuff is going on around us, so it\u2019s\nnot surprising the public thinks there\u2019s\nsomething in it.\nYou promote an idea of Dylan\nEvan\u2019s, suggesting alternative\nmedicines and therapies should\ncome with disclaimer labels; that\nthis \u00a340 billion industry should\nbe regulated. How easy do you\nthink it would be to impose this\nregulation?\nI don\u2019t know \u2013 it\u2019s a funny one \u2013 if I\nwant to fit a gas meter in my house,\nwhoever does it has to be CORGI reg-istered. If someone wants to give me\na checkup, it could be anyone. You\ncould go home tonight and put up an\nadvert calling yourself a homeopath,\nand nobody could stop us. You have\nto be trained to install a gas meter, but\nyou don\u2019t have to be to treat someone\nelse. This is where the regulation falls\napart - the really bizarre thing is that\nalthough I can treat anyone who wants\nto see me and pay me, I can\u2019t treat any\nanimals \u2013 to treat animals you need\nto be a fully trained vet. Animals have\nmore protection than us!\nSay you suffered from something,\nsay irritable bowel syndrome,\nwhich hasn\u2019t responded well to\nconventional treatment. You then\ncome across an alternative ther-apy, which as a scientist sounds\nplausible and useful. How would\nyou go about investigating it?\nI\u2019d get a copy of my book and I\u2019d look\nit up! We look at the 30 most popular\nherbal remedies, which have been the\nmost investigated, and say what they\u2019re\neffective for. If it was mild depression,\nand it was St John\u2019s Wort, which really\ndoes seem to be effective (though it\ndoes have some side effects) then I\u2019d go\nand speak to my GP. I was recently given some pills by a herbalist, of which\nI was supposed to take 30 a day, and I\nsaid I\u2019d like to talk to my GP first. Their\nresponse was \u201cThere\u2019s no point telling\nyour GP, they\u2019re not a herbalist, they\nwon\u2019t know what this is.\u201d That\u2019s the\nlevel of irresponsibility and huckster-ism that\u2019s out there. I\u2019m shocked \u2013 the\nsort of things we talk about in the book\n\u2013 if a GP did that, they\u2019d be struck off!\nShould this be a criminal offence?\nAbout 180 MPs signed an early-day\nmotion in support of homeopathy. It\u2019s\nthe most extreme example of political\ncowardice I can imagine \u2013 they\u2019re being asked to endorse a form of medicine most doctors don\u2019t seem to sup-port. If they campaigned to get rid of\nit, they know about 15-20% of their\nconstituency, who maybe use home-opathy, would say \u201chow dare you try to\ndeprive me of this medicine, or cut it\nAnd the ones that mother gives you, don't do anything at all. Well, if they're homeopathic that is\nout of the NHS\u201d, and they\u2019d lose votes.\nRather than do that, they\u2019d prefer to\nperpetuate this lie that homeopathy is\nsome kind of effective medicine.\nAnd similarly universities which\nteach alternative medicine \u2013 absolutely\nbogus science \u2013 and which at the end\nof it give people a BSc. I\u2019m really proud\nof my BSc from Imperial College. I\u2019d\nalways understood what it meant was\nthat lots of clever scientists in the past\nhad built up this body of knowledge,\nand that other clever scientists had\ntaught it to me, and that I\u2019d accumulated this body of knowledge of what\nscience is, and what science has taught\nus, and where it\u2019s going in the future,\nand that I could walk out of Imperial a\nlittle budding scientist, who\u2019d learned\nsomething. At other places, when you\ndo a BSc, in complementary medicine,\nyou\u2019re being taught pseudo-science.\nAs a student you\u2019re being misled, and\nif you later go and treat people later\nyou\u2019re misleading your patients.\nI think it\u2019s an utter disgrace that\nWestminster University, which in so\nmany ways is a respectable place, with\ngood research and good teaching, is\nprepared to undermine the integrity of\nBritish education in this way. It would\nbe wonderful if some of the academics\nat Westminster had the guts to stand\nup and say \u201cI\u2019m a biochemist here and\nI care about what we stand for, and I\ndon\u2019t want to be in a university where,\nin one part, we teach that the more\ndose you give someone, the bigger the\neffect, and in that little bit, they teach\nthe opposite\u201d.\nOne interesting thing here, to go back\nto your earlier question, is that I love\nphysics, and maths and the pure science side, still more than anything else.\nThe direction here is not just a shift in\nsubject matter, it\u2019s also shifting to an issue which faces society and which just\nmakes me angry and frustrated. I think\nit\u2019s a role for young scientists and un-dergraduates, to get involved.\nIn what way?\nSay going to pharmacists and asking\n\u201cYou\u2019re selling this stuff, do you believe in it? How does it work?\u201d I think\nthere\u2019s a level of involvement, becoming active. There\u2019s an organisation,\nthe Voice of Young Scientists (VOYS),\nand they\u2019re great \u2013 there\u2019s a cosmetic,\nwhich is supposed to block radiation,\nand they\u2019ve just rung up the company\nwhich makes it, and asked \u201cHow does\nit work? Sounds fantastic!\u201d They\u2019ve\nbasically been causing a little bit of\nmischief, and forcing people to justify\nwhat it is they\u2019re selling. And I think\nthe more that scientists can confront\nthese issues, and talk about them, and\ncause trouble with the people that sell\nthem, and try and talk to other people\nwho may be less aware of how science\nworks, the better!\nAnd so what now \u2013 any ideas for\nthe next project? I imagine you\u2019ll\nbe sticking with this one for a\nwhile.\nThese things do roll on for a while \u2013 I\u2019ll\nbe going to America in August, to talk\nabout the book there. It\u2019s a fascinating\nprocess, writing a book, but it\u2019s also exhausting \u2013 for two years I\u2019ve not read\na novel or any other non-fiction. It\u2019s\nlovely to think that this summer I\u2019ll be\nable to sit down and read a book. And I\nmight read one which triggers my next\nproject \u2013 these things fall into your lap\nin a way which you never expect! Now\nI\u2019m writing about things which appal\nand anger me. I\u2019ve got involved in the\ndebate on some of the bad and ludicrous anti-science which tries to explain global warming isn\u2019t serious, isn\u2019t\ncaused by humans. I\u2019m a firm believer\nthere\u2019s a scientific consensus that global warming\u2019s real, and that we need to\nact \u2013 so maybe my next book will also\nbe this angry sort too!\nSimon Singh and Edzard Ernst's new book, \"Trick Or Treatment?\nAlternative Medicine On Trial\" is a great read, combining the storytelling and lucidity we've now come to expect from Singh with a\nfair and rigourous assessment of a range of alternative therapies,\nfrom herbal medicine to acupuncture. Supplemented with histories\nof the therapies' often baffling origins and a thoughtful discussion\nof the ethics involved, the book is rounded off with useful reference material on the most often-encountered alternative therapies.\nSimon Singh and Transworld Publishers have kindly donated a\ncompetition copy to Felix, which can be all yours, if you get the\nfollowing question right.\nWhich higher-level institution was Singh based at for his Ph.D.?\n1. Exeter University\n2. Cambridge University\n3. Imperial College London\n4.

Chalayan was interested in refugees in the context of identityand the\nidea of having to pack one\u2019s belongings\nto flee undesirable circumstances.\nHis piece consisted of a few chairs\nsurrounding an ordinary circular\nwooden table. When the models ap-pear, they remove the cloth from the\nchairs and don them as dresses, and\nthe frames fold into suitcases. After, a\nmodel steps into the centre of the ta-ble, which then folds into a tiered skirt,\nbefore the group walks away. Visually\npowerful and iconic in the world of\nfashion and design, this is worth the\nadmission alone.\nAnd what of the architecture die-hards? Thankfully, there is ample to\nsatisfy here on that count as well.\nThe great and the good, from Daniel\nLibeskind to Jakob and MacFarlane\nare represented, and superstars are in\nabundance as well. Thankfully, Frank\nGehry\u2019s inclusion avoided the obvious reference,sinstead focusing on\nhis pleated and muscular design for\nthe IAC Building in New York and his\ngorgeous Walt Disney Concert Hall in\ndowntown Los Angeles.\nSomeone once wittily observed that\nfashion was so vapid that without attachment and association to other creative mediums, it would evaporate into\nthin air. In this instance, it attaches\nitself to that other peripheral medium,\narchitecture. As demonstrated by the\nexhibition, there are more similarities\nbetween the two than you might give\nthem credit for. Neither is really accepted by the old guard and thus it is\nleft to the likes of the more progres-sive-minded younger generations to\nidentify and integrate it as such.\nNo, fashion and architecture will\nprobably never be as expressive as pure\nforms like sculpture and painting, but\nthen one isn\u2019t intended to wear a sculpture or live beneath a canvas. Though\nto some the references and parallels\nwill appear obvious, Skin and Bones\nevidences just how deeply the design\nsymbiosis runs as there is much here\nto astound and inspire.\nIts last parting shot is a Chalayan\npiece from last summer\u2019s Readings col-lection. Bundles of burning red lasers\nsear across the enclosed glass, cutting\nswathes of jagged, angular lines. The\nillusion of geometrical structures rise\nand fall in the melee like the organised\nchaos of a Jackson Pollock, suggesting\nan architecture of the space around\nthe body, Regardless of medium, the\nessence of design comes down to line,\nline, line. Both disciplines in the purest\nsense strive to free themselves of the\nlimits of convention and diktat. And\nin the world of art where most of the\nwork is in the intention, what more is\nthere to it than that?\n3 4\n5 6\n1 2\n\u201cPowerful\nand iconic,\nAfterwords\nis worth the\nadmission alone\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "Culture &\nThe Arts\nArts Editors \u2013 Rosie Grayburn, Caz Knight, David Paw and Emily Wilson\nBudding culture vulture? Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nRosie Grayburn\nArts Editor\nJ\nust prior to the time of writing\nthis column of writer\u2019s block, I\nwas angry. The sun had buggered\noff and the 1st day I had decided\nto wear shorts had gone terribly\nwrong as I was greeted with ice-cold\nwind slapping my poor legs. This made\nme especially aggravated as I wanted to\nwrite a nice column extolling the summer season. Now I\u2019m going to have to\nwrite about art. Shit.\nIn this week\u2019s pages, we have been\ncreeping around small, unfamiliar galleries and theatres in London. David\nPaw has discovered the Embankment\nGallery in Somerset House. When he\ntold me its whereabouts, it sounded\nvery much like he had gone on an Indiana Jones style escapade to get there:\n\u201cI swung across the Thames using my\nhandy liana rope, and then I had to\nanswer the Sphinx\u2019s riddle and then\nI crossed a lake of molten lava, then I\nwas there. Easy. Or get the number 9\nbus\u201d.\nBut maybe this is the time of year to\ntake a break from the sweltering galleries of London. There are so many beautiful parks in London, and all have their\nown individual character. My favourite\nis London park is Hampstead Heath,\nprobably because it has a hill. Coming\nfrom \u2018Up North\u2019, I do like a good gradient and the views across the city and\nsurrounding countryside are splendid from the top of the heath. Heaven\nwould be lying there on a sunny day\nin the long grass with a good book. In\nheaven there is no such thing as a grass\nallergy or hayfever. Next week we will\nfeature a tube map of parks to explore\naround the city.\nOver the summer, I have decided to\ndrag my poor boyfriend to Florence\nand Siena. \u201cI don\u2019t like art,\u201d he stated,\n\u201cbut I will when we get there.\u201d There is\nnothing but art there, except for large\nhelpings of espresso, pasta, and armies of tourists. Maybe to wean him\nonto Italian art, I should take him to\na new gallery that has cropped up on\nmy radar: The Estorick Collection in\nIslington. It is described as \u201cOne of the\nmost civilised ways to spend an hour in\nLondon\u201d and is set in a listed Georgian\nbuilding with a sumptuous caf\u00e9 and 6\ngalleries containing London\u2019s finest\nmodern Italian art. At the moment\nthere is a lovely exhibition of prints\nfrom a well-known collection in Italy.\nHowever, I am really looking forward\nto the exhibition opening on the 25th\nJune at the Estorick: The Mountain\nPhotography of Vittorio Sella. What\ncould be more beautiful than seeing\nnature\u2019s own art that has been created over millions of years? The way\nthe snow folds down the mountain is\nbetter than the best couture at Fashion\nWeek and the mountain looks at you in\na formidable manner, unlike any portrait in the NPG.\nIf you would like to get involved with\nArts, please contact us at arts.felix@\nimperial.ac.uk and we will give you\nfree tickets in return for your articles.\nIt\u2019s like that bit in the Little Mermaid,\nexcept we won\u2019t take your fishtail or\ngive you legs\u2026 in fact it\u2019s completely\ndifferent.\nCorrie for cultured people\nRosie Grayburn sees the World Premiere of Harper Reagan at the National Theatre\nHarper Reagan (Lesley Sharp) and a generic drunk Northern bloke (Jack Deam). People in Stockport don\u2019t have jobs: they have pints of lager.\nI\nt\u2019s amazing when anything remotely related to the North of\nEngland pops up on my radar\nhere in London, so imagine my\ndelight when I found a new play\nat the National Theatre which was\npartly set in my hometown of Stockport! Harper Reagan is a new play by a\nfellow Stockportian, Simon Stephens,\nand it is the most wonderful piece\nof theatre I have seen in a long, long\ntime.\nPoor old Stockport never gets a\nlook-in when it comes to culture-type\nthings. It\u2019s stuck in a limbo between\nManchester and Macclesfield - both\nfar more interesting places, it has to be\nsaid \u2013 and contains a dirty shopping\ncentre, a deserted entertainment com-plex, council flats and a hat museum. I\nam so glad it gets an airing at the National Theatre\u2019s most intimate stage,\nalthough I have to say Stockport looks\na fair sight better at the theatre than in\nreal life.\nThe play focuses on one seemingly ordinary person, Harper Reagan,\nplayed by the fantastic Lesley Sharp.\nHarper works in an office. She has a\ngrungy teenage daughter and a loving husband, who has a sinister secret.\nFor this reason they have moved from\nStockport to another limbo, Uxbridge.\nOn a hot autumn day, Harper leaves\nher family without telling them and\ngets on a plane back to Manchester.\nYou see, children, Harper is having\nwhat is commonly known as a MID\nLIFE CRISIS. We follow Harper on\nher journey to South Manchester, and\naround many stage sets which rotate in\na very elaborate fashion, as she tries to\nfind some answers to life\u2019s questions.\nIn a simple way, the play is like an entire year of Coronation Street played\nout in 2\u00bd hours, with an in-depth and\ndarkly comic exploration of sex and\ndeath. You wouldn\u2019t get this on ITV.\nApparently, Simon Stephens originally wanted the play to be about a\nman but then obviously decided that\nthe play would be far more interesting if the main character was a wom-an. Lesley Sharp\u2019s Harper is a brilliant\n\u2018heroine\u2019. She is slightly adolescent\nin her awkward manner, but this just\nshows she is at an odd stage of her life.\nHarper is thrown into disarray when\nshe doesn\u2019t manage to see her father\nbefore he dies and consequently goes\nwild \u2013 sleeping with strangers, glassing\nuncouth men in pubs and stealing their\nclothes. I don\u2019t blame the woman \u2013 her\nlife is unravelling around her and only\nwhen it gets really bad does she return\nto her distraught family in Uxbridge.\nEvery character we encounter on\nher journey up and down the country\nis watchable and interesting. Her very\neccentric boss (Michael Mears) is just\none of those people you\u2019d wish to avoid\nin the corridor at work, whereas Harper\u2019s mother (Susan Brown) is half Mancunian Hyacinth Bucket, half emotional wreck. Seth Reagan (Nick Sidi),\nHarper\u2019s husband is a wonderful, calm,\nsweet man and my heart was wrenched\nwhen we learned about his past.\nI left the theatre feeling enlightened,\nthoughtful and gobsmacked: all the\nemotions one should feel when one\ngoes to see a play. I loved the fact the\nplay was spoken in Northern, when\nnowadays you get so many actors who\nsound like they have a plum in their\ngob. If you hark from up north, go and\nsee this play. If you\u2019re from anywhere\nelse, go and see this play. It is sparkling\nnew theatre and it glitters with atti-tude. Ee by \u2018eck, I loved it.\nHarper Reagan is on until 9th\nAugust. The National Theatre\nrelease Student Standby tickets\nevery day 45 minutes before the\nshow starts. These cost \u00a310 and\nyou get the best seats in the\nhouse. Yummy!\nHarper is heartily disappointed on visiting Stockport\u2019s Hat Museum\n15\nFriday 16 May 2008 felix\n\n"

    "content": "comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n9\nFriday 16 May 2008 felix\nComment\nULU Challenge Cup final\nand Annual Dinner\nAs reported in Felix this week, there\nwere incidents at both of these events\nwhich brought the image of the Club\nand the College into disrepute. The\nfootball club takes full responsibility\nfor the actions of its members and in\nno way wishes to justify the incidents.\nNevertheless, through this statement\nwe wish to clear up to the student body\nthe exact nature of the events.\nULU Challenge Cup Final\nThe incidents at the cup final were the\nresult of an initially good-natured in-ter-team rivalry ending on a sour note\nwith minor scuffles in the car park.\nWhilst no individual blame can be apportioned to our members at this mo-ment, they were subject to abuse from\nthe opposing Holloway fans, which\nresulted in several members of the\nRoyal Holloway fans being forcibly removed from the car park and detained\nby the Motspur Park security officers.\nNo Imperial College students or supporters were perceived to be worthy of\ndetainment by the Motspur Park security officers as a result of this incident.\nDuring the match one member of the\nClub was asked to leave the stands for\nhaving an unopened can of lager in\nhis possession (there was an alcohol\nban at this year's cup final). He was\ncompletely co-operative and left im-mediately. Since the event the Club has\nbeen made aware (informally) that one\nseat was broken and deemed to be an\nIC Football Club responds...\nImperial College offence as it occurred\non our side of the stand. We take full\nresponsibility for this damage and will\ntake the appropriate action to have it\nreplaced.\nThe incidents from the day can be\nsummarised as isolated minor scuffles and are certainly not condoned by\nthe club. However, we do feel that we\nwere the innocent party in this event\nand any aggressive behaviour was the\nresult of provocation which could have\nbeen prevented by superior stewarding\nof the event by the University of London and Motspur Park.\nFor example, on several occasions\na group of Royal Holloway students\ncrossed from their side of the stands to\nthe Imperial side and confronted our\nmembers in an aggressive manner. The\nstewards were aware of this on each\noccasion, but failed to prevent it re-occurring. ICUAFC have played in 7 of\nthe past 11 ULU Challenge Cup Finals\nand this is the first, and we wish it to\nbe the last, time that such an incident\nhas occurred.\nRembrandt Hotel\nThe Rembrandt Hotel was used as the\nvenue for the Football Club annual\ndinner on Saturday 15th March. The\nevent was in keeping with previous\nyears; however, there were some isolated incidents worth reporting. We\nhave not been directly notified of the\nspecific damages but through investigation we are aware that the men\u2019s\ntoilets were used for vomiting, as was\nan ice bucket. Also, accidental damage was caused to a number of wine\nglasses, however these broke on the\nfloor and no damage was done to any\nproperty or any individuals. Following\nthe clear-up it was found that 2 bottles\nof alcohol which were not purchased\nat the hotel bar were brought into the\nvenue (such action is in conflict with\nthe hotel\u2019s policy) . Furthermore, with\naccess to our function room requiring\npassing through the main hotel lobby\nand bar, several hotel guests were disturbed at the end of the night by the\ndeparture of a crowd of approximately\n100 men \u2013 which I dare say was not a\nquiet occurrence.\nThe Club has nothing to hide regarding this event, indeed both the Union\nPresident and a member of Sport Imperial were invited as guests to the occasion (although neither were available\nto attend on the evening). A \u00a31,000\ndeposit was taken from the Club; how-ever, with previous experience of these\nevents and the nature of the contracts,\nthe loss of deposit was at best feared\nand at worst expected. Hence, this cost\nwas budgeted for. Since the event the\nfootball club have been banned by the\nRembrandt Hotel from using their facilities again, although it should be\nnoted that this is a result of both this\nincident and a further incident last\nyear caused by a separate ICU Sports\nClub, a similar incident which this paper failed to report on.\nOutcomes\nSince the aforementioned incidents\nthe Football Club has been under investigation by the college body Sport\nImperial. As a result of these events\nthe football club was punished by removal from this year's IDEA league\ntournament in Zurich (although both\nSport Imperial and ACC Chair Luke\nTaylor failed to notify the Club of this\ndecision and we were only made aware\nof it through informed contacts and\nthird parties). This has directly punished members of the club who were\ncontending the ULU challenge final, by\ndenying them an opportunity to play at\nFIFA headquarters.\nThe Football Club Committee and\nI are deeply disappointed by both of\nthese events and have been working to\nfully resolve these matters as quickly\nand as fairly as possible. I would like\nto personally apologise for the actions\nof the Club and for any shame it has\nbrought upon the Union, the College\nand our fellow students. This notwith-standing, the Football Club also brings\nhonour, achievement and a vibrant social body to the College, a factor which\nseems to be overlooked with regular\noccurrence.\nThe frequency with which the football club continues to make Felix headlines astounds me. We are the largest\nsports club on campus, entirely male,\nand very socially active. Perhaps this\nhelps to draw a bad press, but equally\nI am aware of many similar incidents\nfrom other sports teams which fail to\nmake the headlines of Felix. What's\nmore, I know that some of the accusations made against us in this week\u2019s\nFelix were a result of the poor behaviour of another ICU Sports Club and\nhave wrongly being attributed to us. It\nis only fair for us to distance ourselves\nfrom these accusations and make the\nstudent body aware of this. Whilst I\nenjoy reading Felix each week, knowing this does raise the question of the\nlevel of impartiality and degree of sensationalism in the reporting.\nICU Football\nClub\nGaro Torossian\nClub Captain\nIn reply to this week\u2019s news article concerning the Football Club, which can be found on page 3, captain Garo\nTorossian gives ICFC\u2019s account of the events that occurred at the Rembrandt Hotel and Motspur Park\nfelix\nEditorial\nT\nhis week\u2019s statement from\nthe Imperial College\nFootball Club (ICFC) is\nlong overdue. The Football Club has taken umbrage with articles written about them\nthroughout the year, even going as far\nas questioning: \u201cIs there nothing better for Felix to do than damage the\nimage of the Football Club?\u201d Yet, up\nuntil the publication of the statement\nabove, the Club\u2019s correspondence has\nlargely been defensive rather than pro-active, and has been labelled by some\nas reactionary, including columnists in\nthis issue. It is, therefore, promising to\nsee that the Football Club is finally acknowledging responsibility for some of\nits actions.\nEven though this is a step in the right\ndirection, the Football Club has failed\nto apologise to the Hotel proprietors,\nan action which other IC sports clubs\nhave done in the past. Furthermore,\nICFC have displayed a surprising willingness to deflect the blame onto other\nsocieties, other universities, and even\nthis newspaper.\nICFC feels persecuted by Felix\u2019s \u201csensationalist\u201d reporting. The criticisms\nare directed at a series of Comment\narticles and two separate news stories\ninvolving them this year. They also\nhighlight there has been a lack of negative coverage of other sports club.\nFelix is not biased against the Football Club. We have printed both complaints levelled at the ICFC as well as\nresponses from the Club\u2019s members.\nMr Torossian states that \u201cmany similar\nincidents from other sports teams ...\nfail to make the headlines of Felix.\u201d Yet\nwe have not received reports of these\nincidents. If a story is newsworthy, Felix will always report on it, regardless\nof which club is involved.\nIf the Football Club wants to avoid\ndoing damage to their image, and avoid\nappearing within the news pages of Felix, perhaps they should not put themselves in a position where their actions\nare newsworthy.\nWith the information available to us,\nwe continue to stand by the news stories as they appeared both in this issue\nand last Autumn.\nFelix responds to the ongoing back-and-forth between the ICFC and its critics\n\n"

The Political Philosophy Society (PPS) has\nlaid on several excellent events this\nyear and I too feel it is a shame that\nonly the more controversial ones have\nreceived the lion\u2019s share of the public-ity. No-one in the Union or the College\nhas ever doubted the intentions of the\nsociety and I hope that Ammar is able\nto ignore those individuals who criticised him and the PPS anonymously\nfrom behind a computer screen rather\nthan talking to him personally. It is\neasy to criticise if you are safe in the\nknowledge that you yourself are immune from response and I would hope\nthat the PPS can rise above the risible\nrantings on message boards.\nYour article does fail to mention,\nhowever, the short time-scale over\nwhich decisions regarding this event\nhad to be made. I received a complaint\nfrom one of our fellow students that\nyour society had invited a speaker who\nhad previously made racist comments\non the evening of Tuesday 22nd April.\nAt no point before this date did your\nsociety inform anyone in the Union\nor the College (as they are required to\ndo) that in light of his previous comments there may be a problem with\nthis speaker which would mean that\nadditional security measures would\nhave to be introduced. To arrange a\nmeeting with all concerned parties to\ndiscuss a mutually acceptable solution\nwas not possible at this late stage due\nto scheduling difficulties. You complain that you were only given notice\nof the restrictions placed on this event\n24 hours in advance but at the same\ntime no formal notice was given that\na speaker was invited to Imperial College who has a history of inciting racial\nhatred. As a result of this incident our\nroom booking form is now going to\nbe updated to make this obligation to\nevent organisers a lot clearer.\nSeveral contributors to Felix last\nweek spoke for the whole student body\nwhen registering their disgust that a\nmember of the British National Party\nhad been elected to the London Assembly. If a BNP speaker was invited\nto campus there would be uproar and\nI would like to think that there would\nbe no tacit acceptance that the antiSemitism espoused by Dr Mahathir is\nsomehow a less serious form of racism by any student at Imperial College.\nHaving gained knowledge of his racist views, please forgive me if I do not\nshare your concerns that Dr Mahathir\nfelt \u201cinsulted\u201d by the steps the College\ntook to ensure that the talk and subsequent discussion remained focused on\nthe advertised topic. If he is still unhappy I would suggest that in future he\nthinks twice about parading his bigotry\non the world stage which has seen him\ncondemned by governments and right-thinking individuals across the world.\nYou also admitted in your article that\nyou were disappointed with the conduct of the Ramadhan Foundation. It\nwas clear a couple of days in advance\nof this event that the overwhelming\nmajority of guests would not be members of the College thus if this organisation wished to host Dr. Mahathir\nthen they should have booked a public\nvenue rather than effectively hijacking\na student society. If they were being, as\nyou said, \u201cuncooperative and deceptive\u201d on the night then in my view this\nvindicates the decision taken to ensure\nthat this event was kept under strict\ncontrol.\nI understand that you think that the\nterms placed on this talk were overbearing but please understand that\nthis decision was taken in the context\nof whether the event should be allowed\nto take place at all. The College and the\nUnion have a duty to take reasonable\nsteps to ensure free speech within the\nlaw and it would not be responsible for\neither party to allow an event which\nwas partly organised by an external\norganisation whose conduct you were\n\u201cdisappointed\u201d with to take place on\ntheir terms. The reputation of the PPS,\nthe Union and the College could have\nbeen damaged if Dr Mahathir went off\ntopic as if he repeated any of his racist comments it would have been in\nbreach of UK law. Neither of us would\nhave wanted this and whilst it is easy\nwith the benefit of hindsight to take\nthe attitude that \u201ceverything would\nhave been fine and a fuss was kicked\nup over nothing\u201d this would not have\nbeen an appropriate response to give\nin advance of this event to students\nwho approached me as President to\nraise concerns about an individual\nwith a history of inciting racial hatred\ncoming to campus.\nYour proposed solution that in future it should be the responsibility of\nconcerned parties to contact you well\nin advance of PPS events would fall\nfoul of the Union\u2019s Code of Practice on\nFreedom of Speech. The onus is currently placed on the organisers to flag\nup any circumstances which might\nindicate that an invited speakers\u2019 presence will result in controversy. The\nCode of Practice required that you as\nprincipal organiser should have given\nnotice of the event 2 weeks in advance,\nincluding a written statement of any\ncircumstances which give rise to concern about potential disturbances.\nDr Mahathir\u2019s racist views are well-documented and I apologise if the\nUnion has failed to adequately convey\nthis duty to students who are inviting\nspeakers to campus. If this had happened then it would have been possible for you and the students who were\nworried about Dr Mahathir\u2019s visit to\nhave been more involved in the decision making process as then time pressure wouldn\u2019t have been the issue that\nit was.\nAs I have already stated, I do not\ndoubt the noble intentions of the PPS\nand I think that you have done a lot\nof excellent work this year which has\ncontributed enormously to College\nlife. If the correct procedures were followed this would have avoided the difficult situation which as a result of our\nupdated procedures will hopefully be\navoided in future.\nWar Crimes badges from Dr Mahathir\u2019s Perdana Global Peace Organisation, available after the event\nFormer Malaysian Prime Minister, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, takes a question from an audience member\n\n"

    "content": "Day 2 \u2013 Let the pain begin\nThe change for daylight savings combined with the time zone difference\nresulted in a befuddled bunch of rowers at 7 am on Sunday morning. Not\nquite awake yet, we desperately tried to\ncomprehend the freezing air and pitch\nblack conditions while freshly applied\nsuncream melted and dripped from\nour faces in the drizzling rain. Much to\nour disappointment, similar conditions\nwere expected for most of the week.\nThe training schedule involved three\nsessions a day, two in the morning\nand one in the afternoon. Some brave\ntroopers knuckled down to revision between outings while the rest of us engaged in some activities such as biking,\nkayaking, blister repair and extreme\npower sleeping. Crews and boats were\nvaried throughout the week introducing club members to a wide range of\nrowing and sculling techniques.\nSome of the afternoon sessions were\nland-based, making use of the weight\ntraining facility, gym, pool and sauna.\nThe centre itself was very impressive\nwith ensuite accommodation, catered\nmeals and a complimentary laundry\nservice.\nAfter-dinner entertainment usually\ninvolved scrutinising video of the day\u2019s\nrowing to improve our technique. Despite Steve\u2019s informative narration and\ncritique of the video, most minds were\nfocused on whose muscles looked bigger and how better to expose their own\nsculpted features for the next outing.\nWith great intentions for the nights\nactivities, physical exhaustion won\nout with few remaining conscious for\nmovie watching or a few drinks at the\nlocal.\nDay 3 \u2013 Beach Bum\nOn Monday night Exeter University\nBoat Club, also training at the centre,\nhad a club-only celebration at the bar.\nICBC members were only too willing\nto show some support on the night.\nAlthough rain was prevalent for the\ninitial days of camp the evenings were\nmild. Pleasant temperatures permitted\nBen Newland to take his stool out of\nthe bar and down to the beach before\nclosing time. Despite this premature\nevacuation, Ben still managed to leave\nhis mark on the night which offered\na welcome release from the intense\ntraining.\nDay 4 \u2013 Thirsty Work\nAfter two tough water sessions on\nTuesday morning, including several 2\nkm time trials, the afternoon was set\naside for a club activity. ICBC\u2019s token\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n26 Friday 16 May 2008\nfelix\nSport\nCarlos Schuster getting creamed by Will McFarland\nICBC squads intensify training in France\nAmerican girl Anna Jones was bidding\nfarewell to her teenage years and we\ncelebrated with a club trip to the local vineyard. Our French translators\nCharles Sanders and Junior World\nMime Champion Ludo Garreau were\nat hand to tell us when it was and\nwasn\u2019t appropriate to start drinking.\nAfter a brief sniffing competition, a\npleasant stroll around the manufacturing area and some mandatory oohing\nand ahhing at the undulating topography of wine barrels, our patience was\nrewarded.\nThe age-old wine tasting process\nof See, Swirl, Sniff, Sip, Savour was\nreplaced by ICBC\u2019s preferred \u2018down\nthe hatch\u2019 approach. First came the\n\u2018catch\u2019 where eager outstretched hands\ncompeted to claim the freshly poured\nglasses. This was immediately followed\nby the \u2018drive\u2019 as wine was hurtled down\nthe esophagus. Next was the \u2018extraction\u2019 as upended glasses were removed\nfrom the throat before winding down\nat the \u2018finish\u2019 by clinking empty vessels onto the counter for refilling. The\n\u2018recovery\u2019 would come much later and\nbe a more unpleasant affair with much\nbody-swing and rock-over reported\novernight.\nHaving thoroughly assessed the ch-arcter and complexity of every bottle\non offer, some period of time passed\nand we staggered back to the bus. Already weakened knees were barely able\nto carry the crates of wine onboard.\nMuch of the wine was purchased as\ngifts for home with this status being\nreviewed as the week went on.\nDays 5 & 6 \u2013 Dropping like flies\nAs the days passed, the crew lists shortened and the injured/ill list length-ened. Emma Murray was confined to\nquarantine early on, seeking comfort\nin bowls of Lipton tea while Mackenzie\nClavin reported hallucinating during\nthe time trial. Kate Wylie was struck\nby tedonitis of the wrist while Carlos\nSchuster was struck with \u2018a pain in\nthe back of my knee\u2019. Blisters were discussed and compared for location, size\nand density. Carrots could be peeled\nwith our bare hands as they hardened\ninto callouses. An infected foot blister\nforced Andy Forrester off the water\nand into the emergency room where he\nwas prescribed antibiotics for the rest\nof the week. Reams of used micropo-rous and electrical tape, empty tubes of\nantiseptic cream and bottles of Dettol\npiled high. And that was just my room,\nafter the first day.\nDay 7 \u2013 Initiaition Carnage\nFriday was the last full day of rowing\ncamp and the sun had finally made an\nappearance. Some Deeps-style \u2018strippage\u2019 ensued and some questionable\nfootage of her \u2018technique\u2019 was filmed\nin the morning sessions. With the afternoon off, revising, sunbathing and\nsnoozing were the day\u2019s main activi-ties. Erica Thompson and myself returned to the water confident enough\nin our water skills to jump in a pair of\nkayaks with our double-bladed pad-dles. We eventually made it down to\nthe dam despite the kayaks\u2019 best efforts\nto randomly spin us anti-clockwise;\nwhich we later attributed to our bow-side-edness and nothing to do with our\nkayaking skills.\nUpon our return and sore from an\nafternoon of hilarity it transpired that\nthe senior men\u2019s squad had been very\nbusy plotting the novice initiation.\n\u2018Preparation\u2019 is one of Steve\u2019s top-five\ntraining buzz words, and so the wine\ntasting excursion was a fitting warm up\nto what lay ahead.\nThe novi were split into teams of four\nand pitted against each other. I formed\na quarter of the highly competitive\nwomen\u2019s team. On the clock and at a\nsearing pace we gulped and chomped\nour way through station one, consuming a baguette, an onion, a clove of garlic and a bottle of wine. Striding into\nthe lead we hit station two performing\na four-man square press-up. Craving\nsomething sweet to finish off our meal\nat station one, gentleman Will McFarland took excessive pleasure in branding the letters ICBC in cream on our\nbodies and instructing us to lick it off\neach other.\nDe-creamed and decorum-free we\ndashed to the riverside and into a sculling boat for round three. One member\nhad to scull and the other coxed while\ndowning a glass of wine. Out around\nthe yellow buoy where cox and scull-er switched seats and sculled back to\nswap with the other team members.\nWe finished the water race in record\ntime while the boys were still trying to\nfigure out what the second oar was for.\nWith victory in sight the final stages\ninvolved lashing our blistered hands\nin alcohol and high fiving Rob Manton\nbefore washing down yet another bottle of wine and contorting our bodies\nto spell the letters ICBC. Dripping with\nwine, faces sticky from cream-licking\nand emitting a strange garlic/onion\nodour, we took first place earning some\nwell deserved beer and gum.\nThe concoction of sunlight, wine,\nonion, garlic and beer successfully\nblurred the lines of reality and caution\nwas thrown to the wind. Also thrown\nto the wind (or rather into the freezing\nriver) were coxes, coaches and rowers\nalike. The slightest movement or misplaced eye contact initiated a Lord of\nthe Flies type pursuit. Coaches Nigel\nAtkinss and Ross Smitheson meekly\nretreated to the trailers, Nigel impressively entangling himself around the\ntrailer\u2019s beams before giving in to the\nwine-soaked mob. Deeps thrashed\nherself about like a fish out of water\nwhile Selina repeatedly demonstrated\nher leg-press capabilities to the bitter end; but neither could escape the\ndrenching.\nWith calm temporarily restored and\ninitiation residue showered off, it was\ntime for the last supper before departure the next day. The novice boys\nwere each presented with a delightful\nhandbag to accentuate the feminine\nqualities they had been displaying all\nweek. Mogens Mathiesen and John\nDick looked particularly fetching on\nthe night. Goggles and swimming\nhats were awarded to pair-swimmers\nMackenzie & Anna and Andy & Mike.\nShower caps were distributed to John\n\u2018The Handbrake\u2019 Davey and Dan \u2018The\nBicep\u2019 Everall for some undisclosed\nnocturnal shenanigans. I humbly accepted the inaugural Duffy Award of a\nbox of nails for continuing to row, despite having involuntarily donated half\nmy hand to the aquatic vertebrates of\nthe river. A proud moment for Duffys\nacross Ireland.\nDonning shower caps, goggles and\nhandbags, ICBC celebrated a successful week with a trip to the Castle bar\nacross the road for a \u2018quiet\u2019 drink, or\ntwo, or maybe a few more.\nDay 8 \u2013 Shaped up and shipping\nout\nThe final day had arrived and our last\nouting was scheduled for 8:00 am.\nAfter sweating out a few time trials\ndown the river we paddled back, and\nbegan derigging and loading the boats\nonto the trailers. Breakfast was an\nemotional time having formed strong\nbonds with Coco Pops, Miel pops, the\noccasional Choco Flake, hot chocolate\nand of course, the endless supply of ba-guettes. Coaches and boats departed\nearly for the long drive home while the\nrest of had the day to unwind.\nICBC members sprawled their weary\nbodies across the grass where flesh\nwas revealed, sun cream was applied\nand Kieron broke out the champagne\nin style.\nIn the late afternoon four of the larger\npaddle boats were strung together in a\nmakeshift raft and we floated down the\nriver with our mini picnic of biscuits,\nbeer and wine. The entertainment\nwas provided by seat-racers whom we\ndidn\u2019t distract at all.\nLike all good things, camp had come\nto an end. The coach arrived and after\na scenic route to the airport it was just\nfifteen minutes before check-in closed\nwhen we arrived.\nRumours of cheese being confiscated\nat security had ICBC members frantically unwrapping and chomping down\non their baguettes supplied earlier by\nthe camp caterers. Exhausted, aching\nand blistered we arrived at Gatwick\nAirport late on Saturday night and\nwent our separate ways to recuperate...\nbefore training on Monday.\nGreat people make great memories\nand with images of Richard Winchester experimenting with facial hair and\na sighting of Ross in lycra, this was a\nweek that will require a lot of psychiatric hours to forget. All of the crews\nmoved on significantly over the week,\nas demonstrated by ICBC\u2019s domination of the BUSA Sprints on April 20th.\nWe look forward to a highly successful\nsummer season of racing!\nContinued from back page\nNovice women at wine tasting\nIain Palmer is launched into the river\n\n"

You\nmight have been hearing them since\nAugust last year when they released\ntheir first single \u2018Cavorting\u2019 on the independent label Loog Records, which\nsold out immediately, serving as a premonition of their success to come.\nThe band was used to playing to wild\ncrowds in packed-out venues in and\naround Manchester, and went down\nwell with The Coral audiences as the\nsupporting act of their UK tour. Unsuprisingly then, their first headlining\ntour in October was extremely popular with their devout following of live\nmusic lovers, finishing with a sold-out date at Shepherds Bush Empire.\nThe band have since released 3 more\nsingles, the last two of which - \u2018What\nTook You So Long\u2019 and \u2018Not Nineteen\nForever\u2019 - have been top-20 hits, and\ntheir album St Jude has been eagerly\nawaited.\nThe album opens with the catchy\nand dramatic tune \u2018Aftershow\u2019, which\ngives us a taster of the wholesome\npop-indie goodness which fills the album from start to finish. It\u2019s a strong\nbeginning and is sure to have you tap-The Courteeners\nSt Jude\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nLost causes and a love of the steam locomotive\nping your feet and humming along. It\nmaintains that get-up-and-dance pace\nfor the first four songs, only slowing\ndown momentarily for \u2018Please Don\u2019t\u2019,\na sweet little track telling the all-too-familiar story of the messy break-up,\nasking \u201cPlease don\u2019t pretend that we\u2019ll\nstay friends.\u201d Frontman Liam Fray\ndescribes this track as \u201cBetter than\nanything I\u2019ve heard in years\u201d and his\nslurry Manchester vocals seem just as\ncomfortable with this sentisitive and\nmelancholic number as they do in the\nmore common explosive, upbeat and\ngeneral feel-good tunes which follow\nit. The album does slow down to catch\nits breath again in \u2018How Come\u2019 and the\nlovely \u2018Yesterday, Today & Probably\nTomorrow\u2019 which closes the album\nlike a goodnight kiss.\nSo yes, it\u2019s good. But it\u2019s not really\nanything new. They are trendy, cardi-gan-clad, indie Manchester boys and\nwhile the lyrics do occasionally deviate\nfrom the usual topic of love-life related\nmisery, such as the binge drinking, pill\npopping culture of today\u2019s youth in Cavorting and a quite bitter criticism of\nthe posey and image-desperate stereotype of the \u2018alternative\u2019 music fan in\nFallowfield Hillbilly, these references\nare still far from insightful.\nIn short, St Jude isn\u2019t going to change\nyour life, but it you love indie, it will\nsound great, and your CD collection\nwon\u2019t be complete without this energy-oozing gem.\nFiona Watt\nWestlife. Ho ho, not really. It\u2019s the fucking Courteeners\nMournful post-rock signal men iLiKE-TRAiNS made it to London to give a\nlesson in chess players, fictional prime\nministers and the great fire of London.\nDrawing on events or people from\nthe past, David Martin deeply crooned\nover a solid reflective post-rock base\nin Shepherd\u2019s Bush. They performed\na wide set both from their excellent\ndebut EP \u2018Progress Reform\u2019, and their\nfirst-but-not-as-good album \u2018Elegies\nto Lesson\u2019s Learnt\u2019. Nevertheless, live,\nthe band where clearly engrossed with\ntheir music, as were the audience,\nsucked in through their mesmerising\nvisual displays. Each song has a specific setting and date, for example \u2018Terra\nNova\u2019, which recounts Captain Scott\u2019s\nexpedition to Antarctica. The setting\nwas exhibited with striking, often black\nand white grainy images that dragged\nthe audience forward. The visuals were\nespecially lovely if you aren\u2019t partial to\nstarring at beards. During the last song\n\u2018Spencer Percevel\u2019, David Martin broke\nhis guitar in the sheer emotion of the\nnine minute epic. Lucky for us, how-ever, they also previewed a new as-yet-untitled song, which hinted that the\nfuture of iLiKETRAiNS may be slightly\nmore upbeat. Good, as after an hour\nof melancholy historic post rock, it\nall starts to merge together due to the\niLiKETRAiNS\nShepherd\u2019s Bush Hall\n2nd March, 2008\ngenre\u2019s predictable structure and David Martin\u2019s voice. When Guy Bannister\n(guitarist) harmonised, the sound was\ngiven more depth, but this was unfortunately an effect the band only used\nsparingly.\nOh but the Venue! Trundle along\nUxbridge Road for a little further than\nGoogle would have you believe and\nyou\u2019ll find the Shepherd\u2019s Bush Hall,\nthe Empire\u2019s smaller, more regal little\nbrother. The atmosphere and decoration of the venue made the gig feel\nlike the house party of a member of\nthe minor aristocracy who keeps indie scenesters and long-haired 30-50\nsomethings as close friends. The walls\nwere exquisitely covered in mouldings\nof cherubs and scrolls and there were\nno fewer than six chandeliers (and one\nsmall disco ball), hanging from the\nceiling. As I arrived the \u2018party guests\u2019\nwere sitting in circles or nonchalantly\nleaning against the wall just a little\npassed out. It wasn\u2019t tacky, despite my\ndescription, and iLiKETRAiNS\u2019 sound\nmade the whole place cry of a dystopian future.\nSarah-Emily Mutch\nChooooooo!

The Chinese government\u2019s reponse has been\nalmost immediate, with over 50,000 troops being sent\nto the eight affected provinces. Chinese Premier Wen\nJiabao was at the quake\u2019s epicentre on Wednesday, and is\npersonally leading the relief effort. China has announced\nthat it would be grateful for any international aid, though\nnone has yet been formally offered.\nBomb Attacks\nIndia\n63 people are dead and over a hundred more are\nwounded after eight bombs exploded in the Indian city\nof Jaipur. The bombs all detonated within twelve minutes\nof each other, and in a radius of half a kilometre from\nthe city\u2019s historic centre. Local officials have reported\nthat a ninth \u2018medium intensity\u2019 bomb was defused, and\nthat motorcycles seem to have been used in the attacks.\nThe city of Jaipur, which is a popular tourist attraction,\nhas no real history of religious violence.

The Burmese\ngovernment\u2019s reaction has seemed surprisingly slow to\nmany, with only limited access being granted to external\naid workers. Expert opinion on the ground is that the\nmilitary junta\u2019s offhand approach suggests they are not\nfully aware of the extent of the crisis.

With\nperfect conditions for 7\u2019s & a runners\nup spot here last year, a youthful Imperial team were in high hopes. We were\ndrawn in a group comprising Kingston,\nLSE & Southbank, knowing that if we\ncame top we would once again be in\nthe final.\nThe 1st game against Kingston\nstarted shakily due to our lack of 7\u2019s\npractice, with Kingston putting early\npressure on us. However this didn\u2019t\nlast long & we started to dominate\nwith tries from Joe Brown (3), James\nFletcher (2), Chris Lau & Remi Williams. Kingston managed to get back a\ntry to give a comfortable score line of\n45-7 to Imperial College.\nThe 2nd game was against LSE. The\ngame started off badly with LSE scoring straight from the kick-off. Tom\nCoggrave pulled one back but LSE\nscored again from a disappointing try\nbringing the half-time score, 2 tries to\n1 in favour of LSE. After the half-time\ntalk & a few changes we immediately\nscored another try through Joe Brown\nbut LSE once again scored another disappointing try from the resulting kick-off. We finally pulled ourselves together after that try with Captain James\nFletcher scoring a hat-trick, without\nreply from LSE, bringing a close fought\ngame to an end with the final score\nof 29-17 to Imperial. A no show from\nSouthbank meant that we had topped\nthe group and were through top the final vs. GKT (Kings\u2019 Medic Scum).\nThe final was played on the same\npitch as the Varsity game, and with\nmany of the team having lost to Medic\nScum on this pitch before, it was not\nsomething we wanted to happen again.\nWith Imperial fired up for this chance\nof silverware, we started off brilliantly\nwith Joe Brown scoring twice immediately after kick-off. We dominated the\ngame being ruthless in attack & tight\nin defence with Joe Brown scoring another 2 tries, Freddie Chalke scoring 2\n& James Fletcher scoring 1. GKT managed to get 2 consolation tries meaning\na resounding final score of 47-12 and\nImperial College crowned as champions of the Middlesex 7\u2019s Student Men\u2019s\nCompetition for the 1st time.\nLed by the Skipper the team strode\nup to receive the Cup, a plaque & a\nbottle of wine. Special mention goes\nto Freddie Chalke\u2019s mum for providing a delicious hamper of food for the\nteam for which she received the bottle\nof wine from a grateful team. With this\nrenowned title under our belt and the\nstrength throughout the club, Imperial\nCollege can look forward to more silverware in the future.\nChris Lau\nDay 1 \u2013 Arrival\nShiny new bikinis were purchased\nand legs were waxed in anticipation\nof ICBC\u2019s week-long training camp in\nToulouse \u2013 but Nigel Atkins and Kieron Turkington weren\u2019t the only ones\nexcitedly preparing for camp. Lycra\nand electrical tape shortages were reported across London due to the mass\nexodus of all ICBC squads.\nAfter a short flight from Gatwick\nairport on Saturday morning we were\nwhisked from Toulouse airport to the\noutdoor games sports centre at Le\nTemple sur Lot, two hours northwest of\nToulouse. As the standard of conversation rapidly deteriorated mile by mile,\nit wasn\u2019t soon enough that we reached\nthe centre. Coaches Steve \u2018Want to see\nmy gold medal?\u2019 Trapmore and James\nBlackley had arrived the previous day\nto make our beds and put mints on the\npillows after driving from London with\nthe boats. Rooms were assigned and\nboats were rigged in time for a quick\nwater session.\nChristina Duffy\nContinued on page 26\nCaptain James Fletcher with the squad collecting their trophy\n\n"

Needy McNeedy specialises in \u201cbeating\nsome sense into those who need\nit\u201d, with a diploma in those hugs that\nmake you feel all warm and fuzzy inside (she\u2019d refer to herself as \u201ccuddly\u201d\nin a personal ad and everyone knows\nthat means fat). To check these quali-fications, email her on agony.felix@\nimperial.ac.uk.\nDear Needy McNeedy,\nI had my first exam the other day, and\nI was so stressed trying to remember\neverything I needed to know. It was\nsuch a relief to finally get in the exam\nhall and let it all out that I got a huge\nerection. In the exam! I\u2019m pretty sure I\nwasn\u2019t really turned on by the paper or\nanything, just I felt a rush of relief and\nthen I got quite hard. It was so embarrassing and completely put me off the\nexam, I wasted a lot of time thinking\nof unsexy things (like maths) trying to\nrelax. How can I stop this from happening again?\nFreakedOut\nDear FreakedOut\nEveryone has embarrassing fetishes:\nI once had a friend who made special\njourneys into college at night just to\nsmell the Rector\u2019s chair for a while. Once\nhe even left him a packet of mints. But,\nseriously, exams? You need counselling.\nYou could try popping into the toilets\noutside the Great Hall and knocking\none out before the exam just to reduce\nthe fervour of the excitement, or even do\nit in the exam if you can be quick and\ndiscrete, although please try not to get\nshpaff on your exam paper, because I\u2019ve\nasked some lecturers and the general\nconsensus is that it\u2019s probably not a desirable bribe for good marks.\nNeedy xxx\nDear Needy McNeedy,\nMy flatmate has recently started a relationship with a girl in a flat nearby. All\nof us in the two flats get on really well\nwith each other, but my problem is that\nthey seem to like separating themselves\noff thinking that we don\u2019t know what is\ngoing on. How do I get them to integrate back as I just want to tell them\nthat we all know what is going on?\nAnon.\nDear Anon.\nThis situation requires one of my all-time favourite things: a party! Throw\na party in either flat, invite all your\nfriends (I await my email invite eagerly,\nnot that I won\u2019t already have something\nbetter to do that evening.), make some\njugs of extremely strong Pimms and\nwait\u2026 either until you \u201cdiscover\u201d them\nat it in the airing cupboard or you\u2019re so\nintoxicated that you don\u2019t care about\nasking them why they don\u2019t just get it all\nout in the open if they\u2019re going to make\nit so bloody obvious.\nNeedy xxx\nDear Needy McNeedy,\nI get the worst hangovers ever. It\u2019s now\nsummer party season, and I seriously\ncan\u2019t cope with lying in bed all day after\na single glass of dry white at every barbeque I attend. I like to go out a lot but\nI\u2019ve got a project to do which means I\nneed to be in college every day. It\u2019s not\nlike I even drink that much the night\nbefore! What\u2019s your advice for curing\nthe most awful hangovers?\nPartyGirl\nDear PartyGirl,\nUs party animals must stick together!\nSome people swear by drinking a bottle of champers in the bath before bed,\nalthough I\u2019ve never tried it so this one\ncomes without the Needy guarantee. I\nfind chilled Lucozade Sport is a must\n(get the bottle that you can tip upside\ndown without spilling so you can lie\nsemi supine and still drink), but the absolute best cure for a hangover is slow\nsex: the endorphins with quell even the\nmost potent headache. You need to find\nsomeone who will ignore your hangover\nmusk and doesn\u2019t mind getting a bit\nfresh the morning after.\nNeedy xxx\n[Dear Reader,\nI would like to point out that\nthe second problem in last\nweek\u2019s column was a hoax,\nprobably planted by the maniac\nfrom the horoscopes section.\nIf you have any real finance\nrelated questions, sod off to an\ninvestment bank seminar.\nNeedy xxx]\nLovin\u2019 it before the big M stole her only catchphrase.

The results of the West Virginia primary\nare a landslide by anyone\u2019s count, with Senator Hillary\nClinton defeating Senator Obama 67% to 26%. This\nhas made Clinton \u2018more determined than ever to carry\non this campaign until everyone has had a chance to\nmake their voices heard.\u2019 Next round starts on June 3rd,\nwhen both Democratic candidates face off in Montana.\nBush on Tour\nIsrael\nPresident Bush has started his tour of the Middle East\nwith a visit to Israel on Wednesday, and intends to make\nstops in Saudi Arabia and Egypt on his five-day trip. He\narrived in Israel exactly 60 years to the day after the state\ndeclared its independence, and was warmly greeted by\nhis hosts. Though this is Bush\u2019s second visit to the Middle\nEast this year, many commentators are sceptical about\nfruitful negotiations arising out of his years in office.\nMost are of the opinion that Bush has only \u2018discovered\u2019\nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his last year in office,\nand that his relations with the Arab states are hardly\nsuch as to give the talks the momentum he wants.\nA\nweek has gone by,\nand the world is still\nan eventful place.\nTwo almost equally\ndevastating natural\ndisasters hit Asia, provoking two\nstaggeringly different reactions\nfrom the respective governments.\nThe aid is trickling into Burma,\nwhose military government has\nvirtually refused access to for-eigners, and seems oblivious to\nthe magnitude of the disaster. As\na result, the story, as well as the\ndevastation on the ground, is well\ninto its second week. Contrast this\nwith the almost instantaneous decision by the Chinese government\nto send in thousands of troops to\nprovide assistance.\nNature isn\u2019t the only villain in\nthis week\u2019s issue, as bombs explode in the historic city of Jaipur,\nand Hezbollah now reveals itself\nto be the real power in Lebanon.\nTo quote Prime Minister Siniora:\n\u201cWe thought the threat [to] our\ncountry was from our historic enemy Israel. But recent experience\nnow shows that our homes and\nour democracy is being held hostage by our own brothers\u2019. Hezbollah is so powerful in Lebanon that\nthere is now no choice but to negotiate with what the US and the\nUK have long designated as a terrorist organization.\nI never cease to wonder at how\nfickle public attention can be. I\nwonder even more at how fickle I\nam myself - I only pick up on some\nof these stories while researching\nfor this page. The situation in Lebanon is not getting the attention it\ndeserves, and Sudan isn\u2019t a word\nthat\u2019s made it into the headlines\nthese past few weeks, though the\nstate of affairs in that part of the\nworld is still catastrophic. Still,\nlook on the bright side - the US\nelection is still as unconclusive as\never. Oh, and Bush is in the Middle East. That\u2019s something to look\nforward to.\nBorder Closes\nSudan\nLast week\u2019s attacks on the Sudanese capital by Justice and\nEquality Movement (JEM) rebels have been linked by Sudan\u2019s\nofficials to neighbouring Chad. As a result, the border\nbetween the two countries has been closed, and all trade ties\nhave been severed. Relations between the two states have\nbeen poor all year, with Chad having accusing Sudan of an\nattempted coup in February. Sudan\u2019s ambassador to the UN\nhas said that \u2018this is a moment of truth for the international\ncommunity [to] send a message to Chad to desist from acts\nof destabilization.\u2019 Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon has\ncondemned all violence in the region.\nGilead Amit\n\n"

The exhibition starts in the 1980s, perhaps\nappropriately as the Japanese fashion\ndesigners led by Issey Miyake invaded\nthe Paris shows and began to make\ntheir impact felt, quickly followed by\nthe hastily-labelled \u201cHiroshima chic\u201d\nof Comme des Garcons and the great\nYohji Yamamoto.\nThese designers created unconventional outfits, treating clothing more\nsculpturally and including liberal doses of asymmetry and sheer volumes\nmore associated with architecture.\nAs you head into the dark of the gallery through a set of heavy curtains, a\ncollage of old magazine clippings from\nthe time sets the scene perfectly, with\nliberal lashings of the new breed of designers such as Comme and John Galliano. Though not quite the juggernaut\nof modernism, the exhibition recognises the exciting potential of the creative exchange and movement early on.\nThough the creations and techniques\nof previous couturiers such as Cristobal Balenciaga had been described as\n\u201carchitectural\u201d in form, the eighties\nprovides the perfect starting point for\nthe uninitiated as the technology available was light years ahead of traditional\npattern cutting techniques, thus allowing a new spirit of creative enterprise\nto flourish and allowing a convenient\nentry point. The exhibits are perfectly\npresented and in a logical order that is\na pleasure to view. For an avid fan of\ndesign, it is a heaven of sorts.\nZaha Hadid\u2019s angular building proposal for The Peak commercial centre\non Hong Kong Island is quickly followed by a massive full-wall projection\nof Belgian duo Viktor & Rolf\u2019s 2002\nLong Live The Immaterial collection,\nin which models wear designs cut\nfrom bluescreen material. The effect is\nwondrous, with projections of sprawling Los Angeles freeways and reef fish\nskitting excitedly across tucked and\ndraped dresses and tops. Several outfits from Bouddica\u2019s Invisible City collection are also displayed in the flesh,\nallowing viewers to marvel at their\ntautly suspended hyper nylon dresses,\ninterlocking shapes and finlike projections that were more Boeing than\nBrooks Brothers. A video schematic\nshowing British designer Hussein Chalayan\u2019s remote control dress from 1999\nplays on loop. The room is silent.\nThe space the exhibition takes place\nin was designed by architect Eva Jiricna, and is in itself worthy of marvel.\nFlat silver panels roll into undulating\ncarbon black surfaces, juxtaposed with\ngorgeous jabs of teak to punctuate the\ncontrast between the artificial and\norganic so often referenced in both\nfashion and architecture. Wind up the\nunderlit staircase and you find yourself\nstaring down a two corridors in which\nthe thick of the exhibition lies.\nDespite its billing as an exhibition of\narchitecture and fashion, the general\nfeel is that of architecture influencing fashion more than the converse.\nOf course, this is not without reason.\nAs architects increasingly begin working on smaller-scale household items,\nclothing also makes an interesting ex-periment. It is far easier for a designer\nof clothes to incorporate architectural\nsensibilities into his or her work on\na small and relatively low-cost scale,\nthan it is for an architect to boldly experiment with couture techniques on a\nmassive scale under even larger commercial pressures and logistic con-straints. It is more straightforward to\nwork alone with yards of silk and crepe\nthan it is to work with several engineering teams and construction firms\non a project involving steel beams and\nfragile glass panels.\nThus it seems somewhat simpler to\nfind examples of architecture in fashion than vice-versa. The crowd at the\nexhibition are also distinctly in the\nfashion camp \u2013 leggings, status bags\nand wedges galore, though occasionally a lost architecture student wanders in and provides some contrast to\nthe crowds counting the layers rapidly\naccumulating on model Maggie Rizer\nin Viktor & Rolf\u2019s 1999 Russian Doll\nshow, in which a model has progressive\ntiers of dresses layered upon her.\nThe upstairs takes techniques from\neach discipline such as draping, decon-struction, printing, use of geometry\nand volume, and compares the crossover of each technique into the domain\nof the other. The appeal of this is made\nstarkly apparent in many examples, but\nnone more so than in the \u201cprinting\u201d\nsection, in which a technique normally\nused by fashion designers such as Matthew Williamson is splayed in ceramic\ntiles across the roof of Santa Caterina\nmarket in Barcelona by the dynamic\narchitecture group EMBT.\nSimilarly, the use of paper tubes is\ncontrasted between architect Shigeru\nBan\u2019s paper tube shelters used to\nhouse refugees in Rwanda, and Yohji\nYamamoto\u2019s stunning and innovative\nuse of them in his \u201csecret dress\u201d from\nhis 1999 Wedding collection. Their\ninnovative and surprisingly practical application (used in the latter in\nlieu of zips to \u201clock\u201d sections of material together) is a testament to the\nforward thinking of visionaries such\nas Yamamoto and Ban. Though they\nwon\u2019t be in the mainstream any time\nsoon, the path is already paved.\nIn addition to comparisons, collaborations are also evident. Those who\ntake note of luxury trends will note the\nnow-established trend of collaboration\nbetween fashion designers and luxury\nlabels with prestigious architects. The\ngiven examples here are Herzog & De\nMeuron\u2019s collaboration with Prada on\nanepicstoreinAoyama,Tokyo,andFu-ture Systems\u2019 design for the Selfridges\nstore in Birmingham. Rei Kawakubo of\nComme des Garcons has notably been\nhonoured with inclusion amongst the\nworld\u2019s best architects in Taschen\u2019s Architecture Now annuals for her input in\ndesigning Comme\u2019s store in Manhattan, a shimmering aluminium tunnel\ntaking the shopper from an unassuming sidewalk into a futurist labyrinth\nladen with Kawakubo\u2019s idiosyncratic\nclothing designs.\nSo besides spectacularly highlighting\nthe similarities between the disciplines\nand recognising a long-overlooked and\nsignificant design trend, what else does\nthe exhibition succeed in? Well, as\nstated before, the space is a fashion and\narchitecture junkie\u2019s dream come true.\nFinally, after the frivolity of purely aesthetic fashion with its frills and oversized bows comes fashion anchored\nin pure design sensibility and with it,\nnames not normally seen in showrooms and boutiques, let alone major\nexhibitions. For this alone the fashion\nand design community owes the organisers no small gratitude.\nWired ensembles and jaw dropping\ntechnocouture dresses by Junya WaThe Japanese designer Yohji Yamamoto\u2019s sculptural and tastefully clean clothes are design favourites in the world of architecture\n\u201cThe exhibition\nrecognises the\nexciting potential\nof the creative\nexchange\u201d\n\n"

Second came\nthe females, socialising amongst themselves through grooming and commu-nicating. Next came the fighting ado-lescents; and then finally the dominant\nalpha male Silverback of the group.\nHe was by far the most imposing family member, being the largest, the loud-est, the most ferocious and the most\ngentle. He had a thick lining of silver\nhairs on his back, almost like a crown,\nand we watched him break numerous\ntrees to distance himself from us. He\nhid in bushes and brooded in corners\nbefore finally coming out into the open\nto thump his barrel chest. All of this\nmade for spectacular viewing and before we knew it, our designated hour\nwith the Gorillas was up and we had to\nstart on our way back to civilisation.\nI was not too happy to find out that\nthe park soon after suffered an outbreak of Ebola virus that claimed 133\nlives, but in retrospect the risk was\nworth the intimate photos I got of these\nextraordinary beasts. It was unfortunate that in order to get close enough I\nhad to get Gorilla excrement, the main\ntransmitter of Ebola, smeared on my\nshoes and trousers but like I said, it was\nwell worth the risk!\nThe endangered Silverback Gorillas\ncurrently find themselves in a perilous\nsituation. Not only is their habitat being destroyed at an unprecedented rate\nbut they are also facing threats from\npoaching and hunting. Last year in the\nDRC, five members of a family were\nshot and killed for no apparent reason.\nThe importance of the Gorillas to\nthe natural world and the economy of\nCongo cannot be underestimated, but\nas Kennedy exclaimed \u201cI don\u2019t think\nour President even knows we have Gorillas in this country\u201d. This sums up the\nsituation here quite neatly, and sadly\nthis is not the only challenge facing the\nDRC right now.\nGoma, the town where I was based,\nwas one buried under lava after several\neruptions from the local Nyiragongo\nvolcano. Consisting of a few dusty ash\nfilled streets and some stunning lava\nlandscape; there was not too much to\ndo here. To find activity one had to\nlook beyond its confines and although I\nhad been told to the contrary in neighbouring Rwanda, the area surrounding\nit wasn\u2019t totally stable.\nUnexpectedly, General Nkunda and\nhis rebels mentioned above had decided to launch an attack on government\ntroops and the presidential guard in\nthe local North Kivu region almost immediately after I returned from my Gorilla visit. This abrupt and unfortunate\ndevelopment was obviously a source of\nmisery to the locals who wanted nothing to do with politics getting out of\nhand but was, dare I admit it, a new\nsource of excitement for me.\nNkunda was a Tutsi who joined the\nDRC army under the government\u2019s\n\u2018mixed brigades\u2019 programme that was\ninitiated to absorb local Tutsi groups.\nHowever, recent government orders\nmeant that these brigades were to be\nrelocated to other parts of the country,\nsomethingNkundaandthesoldiersun-der him didn\u2019t agree with. They wanted to remain deployed in areas close to\nthe Tutsi community they belonged to,\nin order to oversee the protection of\ntheir community against Hutu rebels\nstill active in east DRC following their\nforced removal from Rwanda post the\n1994 genocide there.\nAs usual in conflicts of this nature,\npretty soon this faction of the army became rebels and took up arms against\nthe government. The problem is now\nfar beyond the simple initial disagreement and according to recent reports,\nthe fighting is still rising in intensity.\nResolution is a far cry and this is a sad\nmanifestation of the Rwandan conflict\nspilling over into DRC.\nThe UN was sent over to this war\ntorn mix to try and aid things. Functioning under the name of MONUC,\nits job was to try to bring and maintain\npeace, and to move the DRC towards a\ncredible election process. Considering\nthat it was the UN\u2019s largest and most\nexpensive mission, hopes were high.\nI didn\u2019t know any of the above when\nI arrived. Feeling restricted by the\nconflict and bewildered amongst the\nsudden military activity, I went to MONUC headquarters in Goma to try and\nget some information for myself during this latest round of uncertainty.\nPosing as a \u2018foreign journalist\u2019 (essen-tially true as I am now writing this in\nthe Felix), I approached the MONUC\nheadquarters in Goma, hoping that\nthey will be able to tell me something\nof interest that I could take back to\nthe settlement of Nkunda supporters\namongst whom I was temporarily re-siding. Fate was on my side as the MONUC staff let me in to meet with the\nhead of PR, who guided me through\nthe history of the conflict but was tight\nlipped about recent developments.\nJudging by the inactivity of the UN\ntroops who were spending time playing badminton and having barbecues,\nit did not seem like the UN was actively\nparticipating beyond providing equipment to the Congolese army.\nI took my perceptions from this\nmeeting back to where I lived but no\none I talked to was surprised at the lack\nof UN involvement. Conversely they\nwere quite excited that a \u2018foreign journalist\u2019 was living amongst them, much\nto my embarrassment. These were\nresilient Nkunda supporters who had\nunknown to me and as chance would\nhave it seen it fit to organise a meeting\nbetween myself and General Nkunda\nin person!\nThis was undeniably quite an exciting opportunity and I felt quite the fool\nfor getting myself more involved than\nnecessary, but I didn\u2019t want to turn it\ndown. We were scheduled to meet in a\nnearby town called Masisi but intense\nfighting made that impossible. We\ntherefore arranged a phone interview\nbut alas, even though he agreed to a\nphone call that night, he did not pick\nup as the rebels stepped up engagement with the Congolese army.\nKennedy advised me to leave as soon\nas possible after that night for my own\nsafety and so I left early the next day by\ntaking a boat across Lake Kivu. Sadly\nthis meant that this once-in-a-lifetime\nscoop for the Felix had to be forsaken!\nTherefore, I left Congo feeling a bit\nworthless and slightly upset. From my\nbrief visit, life appeared to be made difficult by many things beyond scarcity.\nEstimates of child soldiers are rising\nas more of the young take up arms,\nwith no reason for them to stop. The\ngovernment and the rebels are ratcheting up the language on both sides. The\nmost recent reports have also indicated that the very UN troops drafted\nin to aid peace are the ones working\nagainst it by smuggling gold and ivory\nin exchange for providing militias with\nammunition and weapons.\nIf someone like me, who as a western tourist passing through, cannot\nsee much hope in the near future then\nwhat must the people of Congo who\nhave to face this situation day in day\nout feel?\nI do not know the answer to that as I\nhave never lived there, nor have I been\nbrought up there, and people\u2019s happiness is not necessarily linked to their\nlevels of consumption and wastage.\nHowever, I do know that I fell in love\nwith Congo and I do know that there\nis great scope for a lot of change and a\nlot of betterment. And in time no one\ncan say how the situation may change.\nHere is sincerely hoping for the best.\nMy first Gorilla sighting. He gawps at our group in curiosity\nFemales grooming The vast rainforest jungles of Congo\nThe alphamale Silverback grazes on some leaves\n\u201cplaying\nbadminton\nand having\nbarbecues, it did\nnot seem like the\nUN was actively\nparticipating\u201d\n\n"

It is a trend seen\nin virtually all electronic genres today,\nand represents something of a coming-of-age for the whole style.\nIn a tour which has taken them\naround Western Europe and will soon\ntake them to the US and Canada,\nEfterklang\u2019s 33rd date was London\u2019s\nQueen\u2019s Hall in the Southbank Centre.\nEmbracing the sumptuousness of the\nvenue, the band\u2019s newfound warmth\nwas brought to a level only hinted at\non the LP, with all instrumental parts\n(excluding beeps and clicks) being performed by five of the core members,\nwith Anna Br\u00f8nsted of Our Broken\nGarden filling in for the fifth. Even the\nchoral arrangements were performed\nlive, with all members of the band singing in harmony. Given the dreamlike,\nsometimes whimsical sound of the rest\nof the music, these sections were particularly powerful, ushering the mood\nfrom the sombre to the divine.\nEfterklang really have managed to\nperfect the art of the live show, despite\nthe complexity of the music which\nmust make its performance a night-mare. There were no points where\nthe veneer of the music faded and you\ncould see through to the technicalities,\nas happens when some electronic acts\nEfterklang live at The Queen Elizabeth Hall, Southbank Centre\ngo live \u2013 like when watching a good\nmovie, there isn\u2019t time to question how\nreal the characters are when they act so\nbeautifully.\nLike the music, the band\u2019s performance is playful and sometimes whim-sical. The violin solo which was supposed to be played during one of the\nsongs by the missing member (stuck\nin Sweden due to UK visa issues), was\nAfter the release of their second album\n\u2018Twenty One\u2019 on the 24th of March,\nand kickstarting their tour in Manchester, Mystery Jets came home to\nLondon to play a very special show at\nScala on the 24th of April.\nThe band came out with a roar of\napplause from the audience , starting off their show with \u2018Hideaway\u2019, the\nfirst track from their new album. The\ncrowd was made up of artsy indie kids\nand people you wouldn\u2019t normally associate with the electronic style of the\nMystery Jets, but nevertheless they\nall swayed and jumped in harmony\nto tracks like \u2018Young Love\u2019, \u2018Veiled in\nGrey\u2019 and my personal favourite, \u2018Hand\nMe Down\u2019.\nAlthough the band no longer play\nwith Blaine\u2019s father Henry, they still\nmanaged to reproduce their tracks live\nas clear as they sound on the album on\nScala\u2019s fantastic soundsystem.\nThe relentless cheering of the crowd,\nhowever, brought the band back on\nstage to play an encore. Along with\nthem came Henry, who played a very\nmuch missed guitar part for \u2018You Can\u2019t\nFool Me Dennis\u2019 and the show\u2019s closer,\n\u2018Zoo Time\u2019. The audience\u2019s chanting of\n\u201cZoo Time, Zoo Time, Zoo Time\u201d added to the already hyped atmosphere\nand made a kickass addition to the end\nof an impressive show. It is safe to say\nthat the 80s-influenced vocal harmonies and synth-heavy melodies of the\nMystery Jets rocked Scala that night.\nThe band will be continuing their\ntour until Christmas this year so you\u2019ll\nhave the chance to catch them in London at Kentish Town Forum on the\n28th of May (alongside the likes of\nMaximo Park and Blood Red Shoes), at\nVictoria Park the 9th of August and at\nAstoria on the 23rd of October.\nRoman Hochuli\nEfterklang have risen to become one of the most popular and admired electronic acts\ntoday. Peter Sinclair went to see them at the London leg of their current world tour\nW\nhen I next write\nhere I will be twen-ty. While there will\nbenophysical,tem-poral or emotional\ngap between 11:59pm on the 15th of\nJune, and 12:00am on the 16th, I think\nin a few years it won\u2019t be hard for me\nto mentally separate the two decades \u2013\nthe teens being as they were filled with\nhormonal instability, getting drunk in\nthe park and Slipknot, and the twenties\nwith its forthcoming vast riches, supermodel girlfriends and utopian technol-ogies. I tend to think of the awkward\nteenage years as very much overrated,\nbut hearing of Slipknot\u2019s fourth studio\nrelease some time this summer has got\nme reminiscing.\nI must have been about thirteen, or\nfourteen maybe, when I first heard the\nband \u2013 I think my brother bought their\nfirst album and I must have stolen it off\nhim at some point. Until then, I had\nbeen bored by the Britney vs. Christina\nwhore-off that dominated mainstream\nteenage music culture at the time, so\ntended to react to most music with\nbewildered disinterest. But Slipknot\nwas a revolution. Drop D guitars, two\ndrummers, screaming and rapping all\nin the same gruesome (albeit slickly\nmarketed) band. Add to this the horror masks, and I was in love with nu-metal. This whole world opened up to\nme: Deftones\u2019 \u2018Back to School\u2019 played\non my DiskMan during most of my\nhighschool education, Korn inspired\ncountless attempts at starting bands \u2013\nit was a good time to be 13.\nThrough nu-metal I heard about\ngrunge, and through grunge I heard\nabout The Smashing Pumpkins. By the\ntime I got into them they were long\ngone, so I had the whole catalogue of\nalbums to discover. I loved the creamy,\nbrittle distorted sound, and I lived vicariously through the \u20181979\u2019 video.\nI actually met one of my best friends\nthrough our mutual love of the Pumpkins \u2013 I was wearing a ZERO t-shirt,\nand we spent hours talking about the\nbreakdown of \u2018Geek U.S.A.\u2019 and the\ndizzying apex of \u2018Hummer\u2019.\nThis column is taking me so long to\nwrite \u2013 I keep taking 20 minutes out\nto trawl YouTube for all of these old\ntunes. I hadn\u2019t listened to Hummer for\nyears before 5 minutes ago, and I had\nbarely given Deftones a thought since I\nwas 16. When I first saw the ridiculous\npromo video that Slipknot have put\nout to promote their new album, I was\nready to cringe at myself for ever having liked them, but I now realise that I\nactually had excellent taste in music as\na teen. I still think the horror masks are\ncool (although cutting off your dreadlocks and sticking them to a mask is\ndefinitely not cool, and quite disgust-ing). Maybe I will buy another Slipknot\nt-shirt. I probably appreciate it on a\ndifferent level now to how I liked it\nback in the day, but it\u2019s comforting to\nsee that while my tastes have changed\nsince highschool, I still deep down love\nmy nu-metal upbringing.\nDoes anyone even read this bit?\nSpecial mystery prize to the first\nthree people who email music.\nfelix@gmail.com\nreplaced by a whistling solo, and several members of the band miming the\nair-violin. At the end of the show, in a\ncharming twist, the band played their\nfinal song while parading through the\naudience in the style of a marching\nband, the main vocalist and multi-in-strumentalist Casper Clausen donning\na snare drum and taking the role of\nDrum Major.\nI had my initial doubts when hearing \u2018Parades\u2019 for the first time, but in\nwhat seems like a complete reversal\nof roles, this is an album which must\nbe appreciated live. When recorded, it\nsometimes feels slightly melodramatic\nand at times contrived, but live it is so\nreal and so organic, it couldn\u2019t be any\ndifferent.\nPeter Sinclair\nMystery Jets\nScala\n24th April, 2008\nMystery Jets play live at Scala\nContrary to popular belief, that is in fact hair and not a shit\n\n"

College likes its students\nImperial tops at least one league table this week: only \u00a36k is made by College from library fines each year\nKadhim Shubber\nDepending on your willingness to part with 50p, you might want to return these on time\nHotel retains ICFC\u2019s \u00a31,000 deposit\nRembrandt episode follows confrontations between IC and Royal Holloway football fans one week earlier\nFigures obtained under the Freedom\nof Information act have revealed a surprising uniqueness about Imperial and\nperhaps a level of benevolence on the\npart of College.\nImperial College London makes the\nleast amount of money from library\nfines out of 20 top universities sur-veyed, including LSE, Oxford, Cambridge, Manchester, UCL and St Andrews. The information provided by\nExepos\u00e9, the Student Newspaper of\nExeter University, shows that in the\nyear 2006/07, UCL made \u00a3168,942 and\nManchester University made \u00a3190,338\nfrom library fines whilst Imperial College accrued a miniscule \u00a36,474. As an\naverage this amounts to around 50p\nper student.\nLSE comes top as the university with\nthe highest fine-per-person figure of\n\u00a310.50; more than 20 times the figure\nfor Imperial. The second-cheapest for\nthe year 06/07 is Cambridge university\nwhich made \u00a334,302, 3 times less than\nits rival Oxford.\nTaking into account all 20 universities surveyed, the average amount of\nfines is approximately \u00a390,000.\nThe statistics indicate that Imperial\u2019s\nlibrary fines are significantly lower\nthan those from around the country.\nThe University of York, which has a\nsimilar number of students to Imperial, generated \u00a383,953 in library fines,\nmore than ten times that of Imperial\u2019s.\nOf course, one can interpret these\nresults differently and conclude that\nImperial students are uniquely conscientious about returning their books.\nA cynic might scoff that it\u2019s probably\ndue to the fact that few people can\nwithstand the Sahara-like conditions\nof our library long enough to take out\na book.\nThe library is often a source of complaint amongst Imperial students and\nthese figures provide a refreshing\nchange. But with the news that the\nrefurbished floors of the library are\nset to re-open in early July, including\nincreased space for study and a brand\nnew caf\u00e9 area, Imperial\u2019s conquest of\nthis latest league table may be one accolade that we can hold close to our\nheart; no matter what the University\nListings say.\nHowever, more studious library-goers are unlikely to find comfort in\nthe fact that we only get a pat on the\nbottom, instead of a kick up the arse,\nsince the current problems with the\nlibrary will not be resolved before the\nend of this exam period.\nTom Roberts\nEditor-in-Chief\nAggressive behaviour, intimidating\nconduct, inciting fights and criminal\ndamage \u2013 these are all accusations\nwhich have been levelled at Imperial\nCollege Football Club (ICFC) after two\nevents over the Easter break. The first\nincident involved ICFC supporters\nand fans from Royal Holloway\u2019s Football Club (RHFC) who are reported to\nhave clashed at the University of London Union (ULU) Challenge Cup Final\non 8th March. The second occurred a\nmere week later on 15th March, when\nICFC held its Annual Club Dinner\nat the four-star Rembrandt Hotel in\nKnightsbridge, allegedly causing numerous damages to the property, resulting in a \u00a31,000 deposit being kept\nby the proprietors.\nFelix\u2019s source from the Rembrandt\nHotel said \u201ca handful of students decided that drunken and intimidating\nbehaviour was perfectly acceptable,\nwhereby they conscientiously and wilfully caused damage to the hotel.\u201d A\nnumber of students vomited into ice\nbuckets in the hotel\u2019s function room,\nfood was strewn across the floor and\nsome ICFC members are also reported\nas having attempted to provoke a fight\nwith one of the hotel\u2019s personnel.\nThe accusations extend beyond\ndisorderly and threatening conduct,\nhowever, and into the realms of criminal behaviour. According to the Rembrandt Hotel source both the male\nand female toilets were defaced with\ngraffiti; an emergency light was pulled\noff the wall; plants outside of the hotel\nwere damaged and left on the pave-ment; and two paintings were taken\noff the wall and smashed, breaking the\nglass and frames.\nAs the footballers left the hotel they\nare said to have been \u201cnoisy and intimidating\u201d, singing offensive chants,\nas well as being abusive towards some\nmembers of staff.\nIt has also emerged that during the\nULU Challenge Cup Final the previous\nweek, ICFC supporters were involved\nin confrontations with Royal Holloway\nstudents in the stands of Motspur Park\nfootball ground. Banter between fans\nturned into fighting, leading to at least\none seat being ripped from the stands\nand punches being thrown. The extent\nof the fighting is unclear, as is the issue\nof culpability. For their part ICFC have\nstated that one of their members was\n\u201cassaulted by several Royal Holloway\u201d\nfans.\nFelix spoke to current Football Club\ncaptain Garo Torossian and captain-elect James Skeen, who denied knowledge of any criminal damage committed within the Rembrandt Hotel. The\nrepresentatives gave Felix their account\nof the evening, confirming that the toilets and ice buckets were used for vomiting in, and that hotel staff were not\nhappy with \u201c100 men leaving the hotel\nloudly.\u201d However, they refuted claims\nmade about aggressive and intimidating behaviour.\nWhenquestionedabouttheincidents\nsurrounding the scuffles at Motspur\nPark, they said their supporters felt\nprovoked by the Royal Holloway con-tingent. \u201cWe feel we were the innocent\nparty \u2026 they came over to Imperial\u2019s\nside of the stands celebrating in front\nof IC fans,\u201d Mr Torossian explained,\n\u201clooking for a fight.\u201d According to the\ncaptain, once the game had finished,\ntwo RHFC supporters who had been\nejected from the stands earlier in the\nday challenged the IC team in the car\npark, with one of them reportedly\nthrowing a punch.\nAt the time of going to print, Felix\nhas been unable to contact ULU for\nits version. The Royal Holloway Union\nPresident, Joff Manning, told Felix that\n\u201csupporters from both sides allowed\nthemselves to let natural tension \u2026 spill\noverintoaggression,\u201dandthat,\u201cindividuals have let us down in this instance.\u201d\nICU echoed this latter statement saying that there is a \u201cminority [within the\nFootball Club] that haven\u2019t been reined\nin sufficiently.\u201d However, ICU criticised\nICFC for their \u201cblanket denial\u201d of the\nevents on both occasions.\nWhen asked by Felix why they\nthought the hotel owners kept the\n\u00a31,000 deposit, the football club admitted they didn\u2019t expect to lose it entirely,\nhowever, they believed that the cost of\nreplacing broken glasses, cleaning the\nfunction room and refunds being given\nto disturbed guests was large enough\nto account for the whole amount being\nretained. The captains also suggested\nthat the hotel was \u201cbitter because it\ndidn\u2019t take the deposit from the Rugby\nClub\u201d at a similar dinner event held\nlast year.\nIt is true that the Rembrandt Hotel\nis no stranger to boisterous behaviour\nfrom some of Imperial\u2019s other socie-ties. Last year, the Rugby Club was\nalmost fined and banned for damages\nafter an event held at the hotel. However, the following morning the charges were dropped when members of the\nclub spoke and apologised to the own-ers. Similarly, this is not the first time\nthat the Football Club has appeared\nin these pages this year. Felix reported\non allegations of \u201chomophobic chants\u201d\nand harassment in the Union in the\nAutumn term, and members of the\nFootball club have made several statements in Felix over what they believe is\na persecution of their club, which they\nperceive as unfairly perpetuating their\npoor public image.\nSome disciplinary action has been\ntaken against ICFC following these\ntwo most recent events. Mr Torossian said the club has been kept in the\ndark about decisions made against it,\nciting Sport Imperial\u2019s decision to ban\nthem from attending this year\u2019s IDEA\nLeague Tournament as one example.\nHe said that he found out about the\nban via third parties, although he acknowledged it was a fair decision. The\nUnion has told Felix that it will be fol-lowing-up with some form of disciplinary action, the severity of which is yet\nto be decided upon.\nFor a statement from the ICFC\nClub Captain, turn to page 9\nLeft, the main function room in the four-star Rembrandt Hotel and right, the sparkling male toilets\n\n"

    "content": "27\nfelix\nFriday 16 May 2008\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Sport\nIt\u2019s been a busy couple of weeks for\nthe honourable members of the Kendo\nClub. Just before the Easter Break the\nteam marched off to Cambridge to\ntake part in the annual UK University\nCompetition. Imperial was off to try to\nbest our showing of a year previously\nwhere we claimed joint third with some\nlesser university (methinks it was Oxford\u2026). The team consisted of a mix of\ndan grades, Takayuki Myoshi (Taisho),\nTheo Rutter (2nd in command and\nwinner of ACC Full Colours), Gareth\nMorris (proud holder of a large beard)\nand two ikkyus (Christos Argryakis\nand Tim Simpson).\nThe team competition began in earnest after a stern lecture from a visiting\nJapanese 7th Dan who laid down the\nrules and tried to get some semblance\nof discipline on the bunch of unruly\nstudents. First up our team came up\nagainst one from Oxford- who we happily managed to beat. Theo Rutter and\nCapt. Myoshi showed how best to cut\nwrists and heads, and the other members of our team fighting their opponents to draws. Our next foes were the\nUCL team- who had a formidable mix\nof grades and experience. Unfortunately this team proved too much for our\nnumber to contain and we lost by two\nmatches. Due to the vagaries of on-the-spot re-organisation, where once we\nwould have gone on for further fights,\nthe pool system was dropped meaning\nthat Imperial was out of the competi-tion, which UCL went on to win.\nLuckily all was not lost, as after lunch\nthe individual matches took place. Revenge was had as both Tim Simpson\nand Christos Argryakis progressed\nto the quarter finals of the kyu grade\ncompetition (beating UCL opponents\npreviously seen in the team matches).\nBut the best was yet to come. Takayuki\nMyoshi and Theo Rutter progressed all\nthe way to the later stages of the dan\ngrade competition. In the semi, Theo\njust pipped Takayuki to the victory\nwith a good cut to the men. Takayuki\nwas out, but with a well deserved third\nmedal. Finally, in a show stopper Theo\nRutter (2nd Dan) managed to overcome Nagumo (4th Dan) of Oxford in\na final that went into encho (overtime\n\u201cfirst cut wins\u201d). Therefore Mr. Rutter\nlays claim to being the best Dan-grade\nUniversity student in the country. Not\nsurprising really as he is on the British\nNational team and was competing at\nthe European Championship ...\nIn our next outing the team took part\nin the first London Cup (organised by\nthe University of the Arts, London). A\nfantastically charged event with over\n170 competitors from across Europe,\nincluding national teams from Italy,\nPortugal, and Sweden this competition was spread over two days. Unfortunately, injury and unforeseen events\nmeant two of our number couldn\u2019t\nattend as planned. Nevertheless, un-daunted, and with a member of the\nMadrid kendo club standing in (name\nof Yolanda Rubio) our team (featur-ing Chris Tang, Tim Simpson, Eugene\nBaxter, and Pichit Hongsaranagon) did\nbattle against that very same Madrid\nkendo club. Unfortunately fate did not\nshine on us that day, and although we\nput up a good fight gaining two draws\nand with one of the newbies (Eugene)\nto the shiai court scoring an excellent\nkote against his opponent, our more\nable adversaries won the day. A pity\nbut still a good learning experience.\nThe team competition was won by the\nItalian National Team, who throughout the competition had been getting\nperfect scores.\nThe individuals the next day proved\nslightly more fruitful. Tim Simpson\nmanaged to scare his opponent from\nthe ring twice, winning a point that\nmeant he moved to the next round.\nUnhappily, he then encountered a dan\ngrade of UCL (Stephane Helstroffer)\nwho managed to overcome his blocking and end his winning streak with a\ncut to the wrist and head. This chap\nthen went on to win joint third place\noverall, whilst first place went to H.\nMiyatake of Wakaba club, London.\nSo all in all a mixed bag of goodies.\nSome won, some lost with a little bit of\nglory for the club garnered on the way.\nImperial\u2019s Kendo Club in combat galore\nTim Simpson\nPichet versus Jordan\nACROSS\n1 Small Spanish cape makes a run\nfor it (6)\n4 Shouldn\u2019t touch the tip of strong\ndynamite (7)\n9 HIGHER TRIAL (9)\n10 Eskimo is in it around you (5)\n11 To shame a party (5)\n12 Information I\u2019m familiar with on\nthe ridge (9)\n13 Former wife\u2019s original colour has\ndied out (7)\n15 Serious cut on Edward\u2019s head (6)\n17 Allows both Avram and Ulysses (6)\n19 In addition to that, Sidney was\ncovered in bees (7)\n22 Killed American mothers are holy\n(9)\n24 Twist a rope as a Wagnerian\nartform (5)\n26 All around a fight (5)\n27 Real vampires sear without being\nprimitive (9)\n28 Bolshevik force translates \u2018Ready,\nMr?\u2019 (3,4)\n29 Sound ring of baby swan (6)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n8\n9 10\n11 12\n13 14 15 16\n17 18 19 20\n21\n22 23 24 25\n26 27\n28 29\nDOWN\n1 Imitate being dead; after a flightless\nbird (7)\n2 Frank movie director (5)\n3 One part hen, one part reveals\nGreek monument (9)\n4 One rousing start can be\nburdensome (7)\n5 Barbecue question (5)\n6\n7 Noble idiot took charge (6)\n8 Steal alien coat (6)\n14 Soundly beat an aged entrance (9)\n16 Dream of Aryan origins makes one\na prophet (9)\n18 Crap spy rounded up, but still has\nfighting spirit (7)\n19 Bird can move around me (6)\n20 Red wound for hire (7)\n21 Weaken pixie gas (6)\n23 Change what sounds like a religious\ntable (5)\n25 Heartless football team of Elrond\u2019s\nkin (5)\nAnswers to: sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCrossword No. 1,403\nA\nP\nO\nC\nI\nG\nM\nI\nN\nT\nM\nA\nR\nO\nO\nN\nA\nI\nO\nE\nP\nH\nP\nA\nO\nO\nM\nE\nS\nN\nA\nT\nO\nR\nR\nE\nV\nA\nM\nP\nT\nI\nP\nT\nT\nO\nO\nA\nO\nS\nI\nD\nS\nM\nB\nL\nI\nN\nV\nI\nK\nI\nN\nG\nE\nA\nA\nE\nR\nE\nI\nM\nI\nT\nG\nO\nI\nE\nA\nI\nS\nI\nN\nO\nN\nP\nL\nU\nS\nA\nD\nD\nO\nC\nG\nE\nG\nC\nE\nD\nO\nE\nU\nS\nL\nO\nA\nG\nN\nB\nL\nA\nL\nA\nL\nB\nI\nO\nB\nR\nE\nA\nK\nD\nO\nE\nT\nA\nP\nR\nW\nO\nO\nN\nL\nR\nS\nJ\nE\nR\nS\nE\nS\nT\nE\nA\nM\nI\nR\nL\nR\nS\nI\nI\nN\nT\nA\nN\nM\nF\nI\nS\nE\nN\nS\nE\nC\nO\nN\nA\nR\nT\nI\nS\nR\nO\nM\nM\nR T Y A G S S K I N N Y D I M\nE P\nSolution to Crossword 1,402\nR R G H A N S H E O N I N A T\nE P I T H E T N E W T O N S\nI\nA\nCongratulations to this week\u2019s winners,\nThe Burnt Face Men.\nTell me: are the crosswords getting bet-ter, or am I just deluding myself?\nEnoch\ned (9)\nth\nThe Kendo team looking pretty mean\n\n"

    "content": "Gilead Amit\n8 felix Friday 16 May 2008\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment\nFreudian projection\nViscount\nKensington\nZ\nealous eyes now scrutinise\ndusty and thick textbooks\nand cryptic notes on binder hooks. No doubt you\nwill now want a chance to\ndraw breath after that adventure of an\nopening sentence; not only does the\nfirst word begin with a Z (ensuring\nthat letter\u2019s extra largeness, how often\ndo you see a big Z?) but it also sort of\nrhymes.\nLike my peers Lord Byron and Lord\nTennyson, both only mere Barons, I am\nclearly an artist of the first rate. Still, it\nis unbecoming of me to so flaunt my\nmany merits when I am about to strip\naway any illusions a mother\u2019s uncritical\nlove may have given you (or your Governess, if like me, your parents were\nfar too important and far too rich to\nhave the time or the need to raise chil-dren). The truth of the matter is, you\nare all inviolably doomed. Do not ask\nfor whom the bell tolls; it tolls for the\nupcoming examinations which you are\ngoing to sit and fail.\nYour ignorant retort may be to claim\nthat you still have time to revise and\nput things right. How very na\u00efve of\nyou: you didn\u2019t understand the topics of those lectures when you had a\nworld-class expert teaching them and\nanswering any questions you had when\nyour pride yielded to your fear and you\nsought them out during office hours.\nWhat could possibly make you think\nyou are going to understand it any better when you revisit the topic in some\nenigmatic, unchanging textbooks for\nten minutes between bouts of weeping\nunder the strain? You couldn\u2019t answer\nthose problem sheets when they were\non a single topic you had just covered\nfifteen minutes ago in a lecture and\nyou had your notes right out in front\nof you. How could you possibly answer problems comprising of not just\none course, but several, when the last\ntime you saw the relevant notes was\n5:00AM the previous morning when\nyou succumbed to tiredness and fell\nasleep in a puddle of your own tears,\ndrool and all other manner of egested\nand excreted material? Make no mis-take: the Sword of Damocles swings\nsoftly overhead (small angle approximation for sine applies).\nThere is no hope: the passing seconds are your foe, gnawing on your\nchances, stealing the opportunities\nyou have left to wage a war on your\nineptitude. Do not be so misguided as\nto think that everyone is, to use a colloquial expression, in the same boat (I\nespecially would never be in the same\nboat as you, I do not travel in economy\nclass). Look around you; look at the\npeople you study with. There are the\ngifted, whose gifts will compel them to\npass no matter the effort they expend.\nThen there are the hard working: those\nwho did not go out, those who did\ntheir essays on time and had no need\nto invent excuses to get an extension.\nThen there is you. All those optional\nhomework sheets you did not do. All\nthose lectures you missed because\nyou were nursing a hangover or were\nsharing a bed with a woman or man\nor animal whose name you could not\neven remember. What have you done\nto deserve to pass? Oh, my apologies,\nI forgot that you attended every single\nstudent night at \u2018Tiger, Tiger\u2019, how very\nfoolish of me.\nAnd without science, you are noth-ing. Brook no illusion: You have no\nother skills; there is nothing to fall back\non. When you lose the safety blanket\nof a world of the maths of algebra and\ncalculus you will tumble into the abyss\nof the maths of rents and work. When\nmost of the workforce at least has a\ndegree in something, even something\nabsurd and pathetically easy, how are\nyou with only your precious A-grade\nA-levels going to compete?\nI myself would just borrow Lord Kelvin\u2019s idea and pay an impoverished but\neducated person to do science for me\nand then pass it off as my own to the\nRoyal Society: but that option is hardly\navailable to you. No, the only option\navailable to you is failure. You will fail\nat everything, you will be abandoned\nby everyone, you will die both young\nand poor.\nWell, I suppose you could always end\nup at the University of Soho. The only\ncourse may be a very practically-orien-tated biology one, but there are not any\ntuition fees, far fewer lab reports to do\nand you get to spend most of your time\nin bed albeit with a fat, balding, mid-dle-aged man. No doubt his weight will\nbe measured not in stone but tectonic\nplates and he\u2019ll have a dazzling array\nof highly disturbing sexual fetishes.\nWorst of all, he will probably work in\nthe City.\nMy summer condition\nLinnearse\nOf recent criticisms\nH\nello all once again. I seem\ntohavecausedashitstorm\nof balti-sized proportions\nwith a whole two IC Footballers writing letters to\nFelix about me (all by themselves, without any help from their mums \u2013 aww\ncuteness!). I was going to whap out an\neven worse parody of the greasy snot-bags, but since the sun is shining \u2013 I'm\ngoing to be nice and reply instead:\nOk IC Football Club, I admit what I\nwrote about you last month/term/eon\nwas incorrect. Here's my revised interpretation of you: \"I'm a little pansy\nwimp, boo-hoo. Why does everybody\nkeep slagging me off, I don't like it...\nBAAAAAWWWW\". Obviously some\nof my comments hit a little too close to\nhome for your liking!\nWell I couldn't give a flying fuck.\nDon't try blaming me for your failings\nas people. The IC Finance Tarts may\nbe completely lacking in decorum and\nself-awareness, but at least they know\nwhen to take a dick to the face (oh my,\nhow well they do it!). Take my verbal\ncockslap like men. Wipe my lashings\nof vitriolic knobcheese off your stupid\nchins and move on. By writing in wh-inging pussy letters to Felix, all you're\ndoing is confirming your wannabe-alpha-male-but-lack-the-qualities persona that makes you so easy and enjoyable to mock.\nYou don't like your club's bad reputa-tion? Man up and do something about\nit. People calling you homophobic?\nOrganise a bar night with the Imperial\nQueers (you might even meet a nice\nboy or two\u2026). People getting annoyed\nwith you trashing the Union? Take control of your 'players' and shift your half-arsed attempts at drinking elsewhere\nfor once.\nMy parody was not aimed at the entirety of IC Football, rather the idiotic\nyobbo nobodies that it attracts. You\ndon't have to make your club suffer,\nguys. Indeed, you should be proud to\nwear your skanky overpriced training tops around campus. However, the\nones with the power to change your\nclub's image won't be me, nor the Felix\nEditor \u2013 it's going to have to be you.\nGood luck, girlies.\nI\nthink we can officially say that\nsummer is here. Midday temperatures are above 20 degrees,\nit\u2019s impossible to survive in a\nclosed room without opening\na window, and t-shirts and shorts are\nonce again invading the streets.\nThis state of affairs may make some\nof you happy. Shame on you. You can\ncheer if you want, but don\u2019t expect me\nto join in with the general euphoria. I\ndislike Heat with a passion I find difficult to express without vomiting. To be\nquite frank, I\u2019m allergic to the damned\nthing. When the temperature rises\nabove 20 or so degrees, my skin starts\nto ooze a warm, clear liquid, I turn red,\nand various parts of my body start to\nitch. It\u2019s not a pleasant thing to talk\nabout, I know, but my doctor tells me\nthere\u2019s nothing I can do about it. Just\ngrin and bear it.\nSo I do. Or try to, at least, as the glorious cool months inexorably fade into\nthe hellish days of summer. My grin\ndoes get considerably less prominent,\nthough, when my face starts to melt in\nthe summer heat.\nI know, I know, this is just me being\nweird and obnoxious, trying to ruin the\nfun all you lovely normal people are\nhaving in the great outdoors. Perhaps.\nI can\u2019t state unequivocally that my\nunusual preferences don\u2019t stem from\nsome long-standing feeling of inferior-ity. Perhaps I choked on a Pictionary\ncard defining the word \u2018hot\u2019 as a child,\nor maybe a freak sweating accident at\nthe age of eight left me permanently\ntraumatised. Somehow, though, I don\u2019t\nthink so.\nIt certainly stems from within me.\nThe summer is a great time to relax, to\nlet one\u2019s hair down and be immersed in\nthe moment. Apart from the obvious\ndifficulty arising from the comparative shortness of my hair at the present\ntime, I find it very hard to relax. I\u2019m\ntense, I\u2019m controlling, I\u2019m analytical\nand I\u2019m obsessive: but hey, let\u2019s not focus on the positives.\nMy enjoyment comes precisely from\nbeing above the moment \u2013 from cracking jokes at the moment\u2019s expense, and\nby revelling in its weaknesses. That\ncomes in handy for braving a lot of\nlife\u2019s vicissitudes, but it\u2019s worth bugger\nall in the summer. You can\u2019t be ironic\nabout heat. Make fun of dehydration as\nmuch as you want; you\u2019ll still end up in\nthe Emergency Ward if you don\u2019t drink\nsomething.\nNow I\u2019m not being intentionally\ndense \u2013 though I obviously can\u2019t excuse myself of any accidental idiocy. I\nunderstand that people like the sum-mer, and I even understand why. The\ndaily message I get smothered in from\nmid-May to late September almost\nevery year is: \u2018being warm is so much\nmore relaxing than being cool\u2019.\nDandy. You prefer warm to cold, I\nprefer Table Tennis to Badminton. It\u2019s\na choice, and like every choice, it reveals something about one\u2019s character.\nI don\u2019t mind being in the minority, I\ndon\u2019t mind being the only person smiling as the weather announcer predicts\ncloudy weather, and I don\u2019t even mind\npeople telling me I\u2019m weird. But one\nthing I can\u2019t stand is the Heat.\nAnd it\u2019s only May.\nMy eyes! It burns! It burns!\n\n"

But the whining arses\n\u2013 not you, Phil Meier, you\u2019re more like\na metronome attached to a cat\u2019s tail \u2013\nbabbling on about how the examinations work, or the landlord\u2019s treatment\nof them, or how difficult it is to choose\nbetween the Azores and Honolulu for\na Summer getaway; well, they\u2019re all really starting to grate.\nI know I\u2019ve mentioned things like Facebook before, but this goes way, way\nbeyond that. It\u2019s not just that a lot of\nyou seem to think the world owes you\na little bit, it\u2019s that you genuinely, really think the world owes you something tangible, in an entirely serious\nway. Particularly \u2013 and I know this is\nlike putting a dead horse onto a circular conveyor belt onto which whips\nhave been attached \u2013 the medics. It\nhas to be said, the further you progress\ninto a medical degree, the more you\nlose touch with the reality of what the\nworld is like.\nGrab a seat in a caf\u00e9 or restaurant in\nSouth Kensington, and if you\u2019re lucky\nyou\u2019ll find a group of students. A typical conversation will start off in a fairly\nmundane way, normally updating \u2013 in\na quite funny parallel to Facebook \u2013\none of the parties to the goings-on of\nthe other, normally involving someone\ncalled Mary. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s\nthe same Mary; but if it is, she\u2019s a bit of\na slut. But eventually, inevitably, we\u2019ll\nreach something that\u2019s controversial.\nI have to say, at this point, that those\nof you undergoing exams presumably\ndo have genuine cases occasionally.\nI\u2019m sure there are times when mistakes\nare made, but most of the time there\nisn\u2019t really much to complain about.\nI\u2019ve heard it all. The exams didn\u2019t follow your line of guesswork. The exams\ntested you on something he\u2019d mentioned in lectures but you were sure\nhe\u2019d hinted you wouldn\u2019t need. The exams included something that would\u2019ve\ntaken ages to revise, and really, in this\nday and age, how is that fair anyway?\nOrifyou\u2019reagirl,maybethere\u2019ssomething inherently unfair about some\nother woman on your course? That\u2019s a\nfavourite too. Good lord, if even half of\nthe stories I hear spewed out across the\nJCR are true then Imperial not only has\na much higher proportion of females\nthan I originally thought but they all\nappear to be conniving, backstabbing,\ndaughters of bastards. Sally invited you\naround for a drink just after breaking\nup with your best friend\u2019s cousin, but\njust before asking you if you wanted to\ngo to Chelsea Flower Show with her?\nWhat a shit!\nIn fact in that sense, students today\nseem even more active than they were\ntwenty years ago, and society appears\nto have more restrictions and problems than even Jane Austen managed\nto cough up onto her manuscripts.\nPeople did this, but didn\u2019t do that, or\ndid it wrong, or did it at a bad time, or\ndid it with the wrong body part, and\nit was totally out of line, do you know\nwhat I mean?\nNo. I don\u2019t know what you mean. In\nfact, I couldn\u2019t give a toss: which only\nserves to increase my smugness as I\nsuck down a cup of Starbucks Soul Destroyer and listen on.\nBut it doesn\u2019t stop. The guys will\ngenerally talk about more bizarre stuff\nthan the girls. Admittedly, the girls\ndon\u2019t make a lot of sense but that could\njust be because I\u2019m not one of them,\nbut the guys are just way beyond that. I\ncan\u2019t work out if they\u2019re just very open\nabout their lives or flagrantly making\nshit up, but the other day I sat and listened to one recount a drug-addict ex-but-not-ex-you-know-right-girlfriend\nhe\u2019d recently taken to sex therapy after\nshe\u2019d hit him with a bottle of alcohol\nduring intercourse.\nAnd this was a genuine complaint,\ndelivered with all the enthusiasm and\nanger of myself at the fish counter in\nSainsbury\u2019s enquiring as to why there\nwasn\u2019t any plaice in stock.\nWhat is wrong with you people?\nAccording to the media and People\nOlder Than Lecturers, the youth is a\nhive mind of rapping, apathetic shits,\nand whilst one out of three isn\u2019t bad it\nstill does raise questions about what it\nis you\u2019re doing with your spare time.\nYou\u2019re anything but apathetic, but\nyou\u2019re firing off in every direction at\nonce with such ridiculous criticisms\nthat either you\u2019re wishing you actually\nhad something worth whining about\n\u2013 and you know who you are, you\nself-indulgent tits \u2013 or you genuinely\nthink that things like the fact that you\nneed to revise more than one subject\nat once or how the price of nice things\nincreases with time, are actually worth\ncomplaining about.\nWhich is probably why people like\nPhil Meier exist. So think of it this way,\nPhil \u2013 my being anonymous means\nthat I can be whoever you want me to\nbe, baby. Just fire away with the criticisms and I\u2019ll lap them up.\nF\nront cover \u2013 a picture of\nsome food. Caption 'Are\norganic almond oil dressed\nnon-pareille capers really\nthe secret to good living?'\nPage 7: My continued degrading emasculation by Tim Dowling. Tim Dowling\nbemoans his daily moral turpitude due\nto his existence as a middle-class, mid-dle-age married father of two whose\nonly job in life is to get up and bemoan\nhis daily moral turpitude due to his\nexistence as a middle-class, middle-age married father of two. He leads us\nto conclude that if everyone else were\nlike him then natural selection would\nsurely cause the extinction of the human race. He is immensely smug about\nhis gross incapacity.\nPage 9: Life as a sufferer of Down'ssyndrome trapped in a feminist's body\nby Lucy Mangan. Mangan explains in\nlurid, tedious detail that she finds all\naspects of life frightening. She rolls\nout yet another report of her infeasibly\nwitty conversations with her partner.\nEssentially she moans about her cool,\nsassy life in lieu of telling us how immensely smug she is about all aspects\nof her cool, sassy life.\nPage 11: An interview with someone\nwith a 'personality' who, when asked\nthe question, 'When were you happi-est?' will invariably resort to the smug\nresponse 'When I got up this morning.'\nwhich warms the cockles of the read-er's heart.\nPage 12: How to \u2026 write a 'How to \u2026\n[blank]' column by Guy Browning. In a\nseries of deft forays into post-modern-ism the witty yet eloquent author disappears completely up his own arse.\nPage 14: An Experience. The left-wing\nmiddle-class answer to watching Rikki\nReduced Guardian weekend magazine\nLake, a person who wishes they had\nmore money relates some experience\nassociated to having too little money\nor in some cases limbs. The reader is\ninvited to weep where he or she finds\nhimself or herself unspeakably moved.\nPage 16: Letters. Pertinent questions\nare posed by extremely eloquent, witty\nand socially-conscious Guardian readers regarding the Weekend supple-ment's lack of circumspection or inattention to detail. All the points raised\nare extraordinarily valid and impor-tant. For instance, contributions are\nmade to the lengthy debate on the true\norigins of the omelette.\nPages 20-30: What People In The Real\nWorld Are Actually Like. The Weekend\nsends out a witty, socially-conscious\nreporter with a photographer to tell\nthe stories through words and photographs of actual real peasants living in\nour very own British Isles. It comes to\nthe conclusion that they are all people\ntoo and that a truly socially-conscious\nGuardian reader should not think of\nthem as peasants (even if they must be\nbecause they read the Daily Mail).\nPages 31-53: Fashion. Ugly people wear\nugly clothes so that uglier readers can\npoint and laugh at how their betters\nhave fallen.\nPage 55: Beauty. Stuff made out of avocado is applied to faces and reviewed.\nWaitrose's organic guacamole gets five\nstars.\nPages 56-60: My favourite organic\ningredient by The Reverend Hugh\nFearnley-Whittingstall. Hugh extols\nthe virtues of an organic ingredient\nwhich he then stuffs inside another\norganic ingredient or hollows out and\nstuffs with other organic ingredients.\nThis week he tackles acorn-fed domestic pets.\nPage 61: Around Britain with thousands of pounds in my wallet. An\nageing Bruce Willis writing under the\npseudonym of Matthew Fort spends\nvast amounts of money on organic\nfood so we can learn how better to live.\nHe visits a free-range almond farm and\norganic non-pareille caper orchard\nand finds that the heady mix improves\none's longevity.\nPage 63: Matthew Norman eats some\nlobster and tells us how tiresome the\nwhole thing is.\nPage 65: Wine. Victoria Moore gets\npissed on Chateau Lafitte before felching her way through the sort of disgusting Fairtrade filth that a penurious but\nsocially-conscious Guardian reader\nmight drink.\nPage 69: Doctor, Doctor. Socially-conscious Guardian readers ask about how\nto avoid Deep Vein Thrombosis on\ntheir carbon-offset flights to Hawaii.\nPage 73: What women don't understand about men. The next three seconds of the saga are unveiled.\nPage 79: Interior design. Socially conscious Guardian readers ask about the\nbest way of storing Fairtrade things in\norganic things or vice-versa.\nPage 81: Gardens. How to make the\npeasants who actually live in the area\nsurrounding your Cornish holiday\nhome jealous with a few well-chosen\nperennials.\n(All other pages filled with adverts for\norganic food.)\nDavid Stewart\n\u201c\nThe exams\ntested you on\nsomething he\u2019d\nmentioned in\nlectures but\nyou were sure\nhe\u2019d hinted\nyou wouldn\u2019t\nneed\n\u201d\nFood, glorious organic food\n\u201c\nPages\n56-60: My\nfavourite organic\ningredient by\nThe Reverend\nHugh FearnleyWhittingstall\n\n"
