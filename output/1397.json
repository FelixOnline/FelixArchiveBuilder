Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nEmily Wilson\nArts Editor\nW\nell hello again, my\nlittle reader chums.\nI hope you all had\na nice Valentine\u2019s\nDay, whether you\nspent it holding hands and skipping\nwith a loved one or drunk out of your\nskull (as is only traditional). Bonus\npoints to anybody who took their\ndate out to something artsy. But do\nyou know what?... You don\u2019t need a\ngirlfriend/boyfriend to enjoy the Arts.\nPersonally what I love about art galleries and museums is how you can go\nsolo without looking too much like a\nsocial leper. It\u2019s an excellent opportunity for some quality me-time. You\u2019ll\ngo home soothed and relaxed, and\n87.5% less likely to bite your flatmate\u2019s\nhead off.\nHowever, you might want to wait\nuntil half-term\u2019s over before you brave\nany of the major museums. South\nKensington station and the route to\nCollege become an assault course of\npushchairs, yummy mummies and\nankle biters. And don\u2019t even try and\nset foot in the Science Museum. Grrr...\nI hate half-term.\nSo this week I\u2019ve been sticking to\nthe arts of the outdoor variety. I\u2019ve\nbeen on an exciting expedition to\nlook at our local British Heritage blue\nplaques. There are literally hundreds\ndotted about this part of London. It\ntook me hours to whittle down the list\nof which I wanted to look for and then\nfind them all. This wasn\u2019t helped by\nmy astounding inability to read a map\nand lack of any sense of direction.\nYou\u2019d damned well better appreciate\nmy labours. I try very hard for you. I\nam but a humble wench, serving you\nday and night... or something. In fact,\nthis morning I bravely sacrificed going\nto a lecture so I could go to a press\nviewing at Tate Modern (see? An arts\neditor\u2019s life is never easy). It was my\nfirst press viewing, and hopefully not\nmy last \u2013 it was good fun. Though\nthere was no free coffee and danish, as\none (well, me) would expect.\nDon\u2019t forget we\u2019re always looking for\npeople to go forth and review stuff,\nand go to these fancy press events.\nI\u2019ve got some free tickets to a couple\nof Tate exhibitions that I\u2019d gladly give\nto anybody who emails in. All I ask in\nreturn is a couple of hundred words.\nIt\u2019s that easy!\nAside from those blue plaques, I\u2019ve\ngot many other delights ready and\nwaiting for your reading pleasure. The\nrelentless Rosie Grayburn has been\noffended by some portraits and wants\nto bitch about them to you. Then Lucy\nHarrold strikes again with another\nmusical weekly \u2013 this time it\u2019s Les\nMis. I\u2019ve never seen it myself, but the\ngist I got from her article was: some\ncrazed French people pratting about\non a stage, with the added bonuses\nof bloody revolution and the occasional sing-song. Also, a nice, young\nman from Musical Theatre Soc. has\nprovided me with an exciting preview\nof their upcoming production. I see all\nof their stuff, so I can vouch for their\nmusical talents and witty sexual innu-endoes. Go see them in action!\nS\nometimes it\u2019s nice to get\noutdoors, even in London.\nSo I thought the good readers of Felix Arts might like\nto escape the usual stuffy\ngalleries and museums and go for a bit\nof a stroll. And I\u2019ve made it easy for\nyou \u2013 I\u2019ve found some cultural attractions that are all within easy walking\ndistance of College, and seeing them\nwon\u2019t cost you a penny. I\u2019m talking\nabout British Heritage blue plaques.\nThese can be found on perfectly\nordinary buildings to commemorate\nthe not-so-ordinary people who lived\nthere. London is dripping with them \u2013\nyou almost certain go past a couple on\nyour daily commute. But did you ever\nstop to think about who these people\nare and what they did?\nI decided to go on a Day Out and\nfind some blue plaques around South\nKensington. If you want to follow in\nmy footsteps, you\u2019ll need: a map, a list\nof plaques to see, decent weather and\na good pair of walking shoes. When I\nwas looking up plaques I used the British Heritage website. This was a bit poo\nin that you can only search by name of\nthe plaque-holder, and not location,\nbut there are more helpful websites out\nthere (GIYF!). You may want to look up\nyour personal idols, or you may want\nto look up who\u2019s in your local area. Or,\nif you\u2019re stuck for inspiration, just follow my lead...\nMy first stop was 33 Thurloe Square,\nex-home of Sir Henry Cole (1808-1882). There is a wing of the V&A\nnamed after this fellow, possibly because he was the museum\u2019s first direc-tor. But did you know he was also involved in the setting up of our beloved\nImperial College? Before the Henry\nCole wing was part of the V&A, Imperial had its Mathematics department\nthere. Just south of South Ken tube,\nand next to a handy bus stop, is the\nLondon home Hungarian composer\nand pianist B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k (1881-1945)\nat 7 Sydney Place. Bart\u00f3k liked his folk\nmusic, and collected it (I bet his neighbours loved that). He was so keen on it,\nin fact, that he is considered one of the\nfounders of ethnomusicology, which\nis the study of the social and cultural\norigins of music, and the kind of word\nyou could throw into a conversation\nfor smuggery points.\nIf you get into blue plaque spotting\n(which is probably close to ornithology in the hierarchy of cool hobbies),\nyou\u2019ll start to notice certain streets are\na veritable treasure trove. One such location is Onslow Gardens. At number\n5 is a plaque to James Anthony Froude\n(1818-1894), historian and \u201cman of\nletters\u201d (liked to complain a lot?). At\nnumber 24 there\u2019s Andrew Bonar Law\n(1858-1923), Canada-born British\nprime minister. My companion on my\nblue plaque expedition took one look\nat number 24 and said \u201chee hee, \u2018Boner\u2019!\u201d - I hope my readers will be more\nmature. Then at number 38 we have\nW.E.H. Lecky (1838-1903). The W.E.H.\nstands for William Edward Hartpole, in\ncase you wondered. Lecky, like Froude,\nwas a historian.\nIf you\u2019re a bit peckish at this point,\nyou might want to pause for a snack.\nThere\u2019s a lot of walking to be done! On\nmy trip I had a triple chocolate cookie\nfrom Ben\u2019s Cookies at South Ken station \u2013 purveyors of the greatest cookies I have ever eaten (triple chocolate\nis obviously the best, though my friend\nhad a mere single milk chocolate \u2013 tsk,\nnovice). They are also my favourite\npre-lecture pitstop, as they serve the\nbestest, cheapest coffee in South Kensington \u2013 get the Parisian blend rather\nthan the Costa Rican. Anyway, this isn\u2019t\nvery cultural so let\u2019s get back to it...\nNext stop: Dennis Gabor (1900-1979) at 79 Queen\u2019s Gate. If you\u2019ve\never lived in Evelyn Gardens (which\nall the best people have), you\u2019ll have\nwalked past this plaque every day, and\npossibly thought \u201chmm, just what is\nholography?\u201d. Well, it\u2019s holograms.\nDennis Gabor invented them. I think\nthat\u2019s pretty cool. And the physicists\nand mathematicians out there might\nhave heard of Gabor atoms (I looked\nthese up on Wikipedia and I have no\nidea what it\u2019s on about \u2013 answers on a\npostcard please).\nA thrilling adventure in blue\nplaques and pointless trivia\nWhat famous person used to live here? Read the article to find out!\nEmily Wilson wanders the streets of South Kensington, looking for famous names\nWhich famous director has all this rubbish outside their old house? This article will tell you! Wow!\nThis is what we\u2019re looking for, readers: lovely shiny blue plaques!\n\n"

They have also led to logistical issues because of difficulties in\nfinding sufficient storage space (which\ndo not stack as compactly as the previous disposable skiffs), and washing\nthem fast enough to cope with demand\nin the Union\u2019s only dishwasher.\nThe biodegradable, disposable forks\nand containers are calculated to cost\nthe Union catering approximately \u00a335\nmore per week than the plastic versions\n(knives and spoons cost the same). The\ncost of forks has increased from 0.525p\nfor the white plastic, and 1.4p for the\nblack plastic versions, to 3.875p for the\npotato starch eco-friendly version. The\nnew biodegradeable takeaway containers cost 8p each, 2.5p more than the\npolystyrene boxes.\nThe DPFS, Chris Larvin, said that the\nunion was \u201ccurrently having to review\nprices across bars and catering as a result of the increased costs. This highlights the impact that the policy decisions made by Council have very real\nimpacts on the activities of the Union.\u201d\n\u201cThis has been the result of a very\nvocal minority harassing the Union all\nyear (the Trading Forum is a prime example which has been hijacked by eSoc\n[Environmental Society],\u201d he added,\n\u201cStudents need to make their views\nknown to Council.... i.e Turn up....\u201d\nThe lead writer of the Environmental\nPolicy and eSoc Head Gardener, Adele\nPeel, responded:\n\u201cThis time last year, 1331 students\nsigned a petition calling on the Union to adopt an environmental policy.\nWithin a month, Union Council passed\na policy incorporating all the ideas\nfrom the petition.\nSome of these claims about the policy are astonishingly blinkered.\u201d\n\u201cContrary to these claims, the Environmental Policy doesn\u2019t require\nthe Union to buy excessive numbers\nof reusable skiffs. It looks like there\u2019s\nan implementation problem if they\u2019re\nspending more on skiffs than they did\nbefore.\nThe Union has chosen to spend more\non bio-degradable cutlery than necessary since suppliers suggested by proponents of the policy were over 50%\ncheaper than those in use.\nChrisLarvinsaysthatit\u2019sonlya\u201cvocal\nminority\u201d who are interested in greening the Union. Yet the 1331 students\nwho signed the petition last year, more\nthan double the number who voted for\nChris Larvin, clearly disagree.\nWhilst I\u2019m not denying that some\nareas of the policy may increase costs,\nthere\u2019s also opportunity for savings to\nbe made.\u201d\nFelix tests the tools with some delicious vegetarian chilli.

    "content": "20 felix Friday 22 February 2008\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPolitics\nThe state of Kosovo is born\nAfter months of negotiations, Kosovo unilaterally declares independance from Serbia\n\u201cThe Kosovars are now independent\u201d\nis how US president George Bush succinctly summarized the situation that\nhas recently occurred in Serbia, and\nindeed they are. On Sunday the 17th\nof February 2008, in a historic session,\nKosovo\u2019s parliament unanimously\nendorsed a declaration of independence from Serbia. The province, previously subject to ripples of anticipa-tion, erupted into celebration, with\nfireworks being set off and scenes of\nintense happiness on the streets. So\nwhat is the significance of this and why\nhas it come to be such an international\nsituation?\nEthnically, the majority of Kosovo is\nAlbanian as opposed to Serbian, a fact\nthat leads many to believe that it has a\nright to self-determination, something\nthat it has been seeking for many years.\nThe repression under Slobodan Milosevic combined with the ethnic tension\nand armed unrest that escalated in the\n\u201890s supports this view, international\nopinion, however is extremely divided and worldwide debate concerning\nwhether it can be legitimately recognized as a state has been ignited.\nKosovo can be safe in the knowledge that they have the backing of the\nUnited States, George Bush declaring,\nin archetypal one-dimensional manner\nthat Kosovo \u2018has a friend in America\u2019.\nSerbia earlier withdrew its envoy to\nWashington in protest citing that Kosovo\u2019s declaration of independence\nviolates international law. The new\nGovernment, headed by Prime minister Hashim Thaci has also however\ngained substantial backing within the\nEU, with the UK, France, Germany and\nItaly all pledging there support to the\ncreation of a new democracy which\nrespects the rights of all ethnic com-munities. Amongst the dissenters are\nSpain, China and most unfortunately\nfor the Kosovar Government, Russia.\nThis opposing opinion of America\nand Russia has led some political analysts to predict a cold war type tension\ndeveloping once again. This, however,\nis highly far-fetched, Russia is nowhere\nnear powerful enough to cause the US\nany worry, to be quite frank they simply don\u2019t care about Russia anymore,\nthey are not major trading partners and\nRussia cannot pose any kind of military\nthreat, this disregard is characterized\nby the fact that there was no formal\ndisapproval of Russia\u2019s treatment of\nBritain or Ukraine. As long as Russia\nkeeps supplying the EU with gas, there\nis not likely to be an escalation of the\nproblem. The viability of new Kosovo,\nhowever, is something that needs to be\nconsidered carefully.\nIt is true that with support from\nAmerica and basically the EU, she has\na much-improved chance of surviving but again the stance of Russia is\nsignificant, the EU can easily protect\nKosovo against Serbia but will hesitate in a direct political or economical\nconfrontation with Russia. In addition\nRussia may see this as on opportunity\nto assert itself, by bullying this newly\nestablished state they are reminding\neveryone, especially the EU that they\nstill harbour ambitions of being a great\npower. It would be more efficient and\nless confrontational than closing the\nBritish council in St Petersburg, possibly more traditional as well. So already\nKosovo has encountered a problem\u2026is\nit a problem, which can be overcome,\nor is the writing already on the wall for\n\u2018Little Albania\u2019?\nOnly time can solve such a conun-drum, but in the mean time the immediate repercussions in Europe, and\naround the world need to be assessed.\nSpain has shown indignation and unease in response to Kosovo\u2019s decla-ration, frustrated at the fact, as they\nconsider it, that \u201cthe future of Kosovo\nhas been decided in Washington and\nto some extent in Moscow, and not in\nKatya-yani Vyas\nEurope.\u201d These were the words of the\nSpanish minister for Europe, Alberto\nNavarro. In addition to this view that\nthe creation of Kosovo is blatant disregard of international law, there are\nalso fears that the situation will ignite a\nseparatist movement. These concerns\nare echoed across Europe, Russia in\nparticular insisting that such a move\nshould have been discussed with Serbia first. \u201cWe are talking here of the\ndisruption of all the basic fundamentals of international law in Europe,\nwhich is a result of years of suffering\nand wars and strife,\u201d was the reaction\nof the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei\nLavrov, \u201cIt would undermine the basics\nof security in Europe... It would inevitably result in a chain reaction in many\nparts of the world, including Europe\nand elsewhere.\u201d An opinion that correlates directly with that of Spain, which\nis already facing problems, regarding\nits Basque population, could Kosovo\nbe the catalyst to a crazed worldwide\nfrenzy of self-determination? More\nspecifically, will Russia and Spain now\nmore actively listen to the demands\nof their respective problem regions in\nGeorgia and the Basque areas?\nThe UK foreign secretary, David\n\u201cKosovo has\na friend in\nAmerica\u201d\n\u201cThe road to\nstability will be\nrocky\u201d\nPresidents Fatmir Seijdu of Kosovo and Boris Tadi\u0107 of Serbia\nMiliband seems to think not, he describes the situation as being \u2018unique\u2019\nand indicating that it should not set a\nprecedent for other separatist movements in Europe. Mr. Miliband, employing a certain level of diplomacy,\nsaid that European nations had given\n\u201cclear leadership\u201d to Serbs and Kosovars, adding that there was a \u201cfuture\nfor co-operation\u201d over the issue. What\nmakes it unique, he explains, is that\nthere has been a UN protectorate over\nKosovo within the independent Serbia\nfor nine years now and so the situation\ncannot be equated with Basque or any\nother issue that has been raised for that\nmatter. To ease the concerns of the dissenters however, an EU statement has\nproclaimed that Kosovo does not set\na precedent and leaves it up to each\nmember state to decide on their future\nrelations.\nThe road to stability will be rocky for\nKosovo, but having now gained independence they are not likely to relinquish it lightly. What will become of\nthe situation is difficult to assess, and\nmany questions hang over the province like a dark cloud. Does Russia care\nenough to interfere dramatically? Will\nSerbia mount any kind of significant\nprotest? Will Kosovo\u2019s declaration of\nindependance be the trigger that unleashes a torrent of European ethnic\nminority unrest? These are all interesting questions, and will not be answered immediately. Kosovo has taken\nthe first step; will she stumble and fall\nor carry on walking?\nThe new state of Kosovo and its capital Pristina, in relaton to its neighbours; celebrations extend from eastern Europe to allies in the US\n\n"

Wellfucking-done you snobby pigfuckers \u2013 I hope\nyou get David Cameron and Boris Johnson\nand all those cunts elected so that you can enjoy your fetid existence together knowing that\nyou had the chance to do something good...\n40 felix Friday 22 February 2008\nNeedy McNeedy: distinguishing woes since 1666\nL\nooking at the state of the\nstudent body, it becomes\nclear to me that you\u2019re all\npainfully in need of some\ngood advice. You\u2019ve got\ntwo options: you could get depressed\nand turn to drugs, or you could email\nme on agony.felix@imperial.ac.uk. I\npromise that I won\u2019t be mean to you, or\nif I am, then you definitely deserve it.\nDear Needy Mc Needy\nDue to an addiction to clothes and cof-fee, I\u2019m running out of money! It\u2019s only\nhalf way through the term and already\nI\u2019ve discovered that I\u2019ll no longer be able\nto finance any drinks or social events.\nIs it really possible to live on a fiver a\nday?\nBrokePerson\nDear BrokePerson,\nI\u2019ve tried living on \u00a35 per day. I find\nit impossible, although someone suggested you can buy a sandwich from\nthe JCR for 65p. After some market\nresearch I discovered that this is actually true (ham and mustard anyone?)\nalthough it is a sandwich in the loosest\nsense of the word, and not one you\u2019d\nreally want to eat. Going out should be\neasier; try entering some of the nightlife competitions (you\u2019re virtually guaranteed a prize \u2013 Greg might even buy\nyou a drink for texting him) or, if you\ncan stomach none of the above sug-gestions, find a rich but socially inept\nperson looking for some friends.\nNeedy xxx\nDear Needy Mc Needy\nI\u2019m really shy but have a hopeless crush\non one of the girls in my course. She sits\nnear the front of the lecture theatre and\nhas the most beautiful brown glossy\nhair I\u2019ve ever seen. I can\u2019t concentrate\nanymore, I just stare at her beautiful\nneck. I think I\u2019m in love. I\u2019ve tried talking to her before but I go bright red and\ncan\u2019t seem to get the words out. How do\nI tell her how I feel?\nLovestruck\nDear Lovestruck,\nFirstly, please make sure that at all\ntimes you aren\u2019t gazing at her in a way\nas to make anyone but those who frequent the SciFi library painfully aware\nthat you like her. If you\u2019ve already been\ndoing this, I propose that you don\u2019t tell\nher and save both you and her the embarrassment of your rejection. She\u2019ll\nthank you for it one day. If, however,\nshe doesn\u2019t already know of your love,\nthen buy some of that green make up\n(make up? I mean lotion. MALE LOTION.) from Boots which is specifically designed to cover up blushing. Or\njust swallow your pride and ask her for\na drink. And when she says yes, don\u2019t\ntake her to the Union.\nNeedy xxx\nDear Needy McNeedy\nI\u2019m a final year student and I\u2019m worried about getting a job next year. Everyone else seems to have their careers\nlined up in front of them, all my friends\nare going to work for investment banks\nand the only thing I\u2019ve got lined up this\nsummer is cleaning my mum\u2019s windows\nat home. How can I find the job of my\ndreams with minimum effort?\nProspectiveJobSeekersAllowanceRecipitant\nDear ProspectiveJobSeekersAllowanceRecipitant\nRepeat the mantra after me: I will have\nan Imperial degree, I will get a job. I\u2019m\nsure you\u2019re not alone in realising its\nnot that easy; employers aren\u2019t going\nto drag you out of bed by the right leg\nand push you towards a desk. Oh no,\nit turns out you\u2019ve actually got to go\nand ask to be given a life of commuting\nand drudgery. Unfortunately for you,\nsabb nominations are over now, so you\ncan\u2019t put off the inevitable by spending\na year debating the finer points of the\nUnion Constitution. Never mind.\nNeedy xxx\nDear Needy McNeedy\nI\u2019m addicted to celebrity gossip sites.\nThey\u2019re just so much easier to read than\ntextbooks. It\u2019s ruining my degree. How\ncan I give them up?\nTheInternetIsForCoolKidsToo\nDear TheInternetIsForCoolKidsToo\nGive them up? What are you talking\nabout? This is probably the best life experience you can hope for. If anything,\ngive up your degree, which is probably\nin something completely pointless like\nthe geophysical topography of the outer hemisphere of mars. Being literate\nin pop culture is a rare skill at Imperial,\nmake the most of it.\nNeedy xxx\nNeedy\u2019s back dousing you with her wisdom and spaffing everywhere.

    "content": "science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n17\nFriday 22 February 2008 felix\nScience\nproudly sits in his office.\nProfessor Wheater certainly has a\nlot of experiences to share with undergraduate students in his early morning\nHydrology lectures. Not only was he\ninitiator of the \u00a310 million Lowland\nCatchment Research Programme (LO-CAR) in the UK, but he\u2019s also a current\nconsultant to the State of Nevada concerning safety assessment for a highly-debated $10bn repository for high level\nradioactive waste at Yucca Mountain.\nHe\u2019s also involved with radioactive waste closer to home. In Britain,\ndespite Labour\u2019s previous strong opposition to nuclear power, it is an energy source that now sits high on the\n\u2018clean energy\u2019 list, partly due to its low\nCO2 emissions. \u201cHowever, this does\nnot mean that real decisions are being made\u201d, explains Professor Wheater\nin a previous interview in LIVIC, the\ndepartmental newspaper. \u201cEven if we\ndon\u2019t build new power stations, we will\nstill have to deal with the waste that\nhas been generated. At the moment\nthat waste is just lying around across\nBritain,\u201d he complains, \u201cthere is absolutely no policy. In the meantime, the\nUK engineering industry has also lost\nthe expertise to build nuclear power\nfacilities. Yet, we are certainly going to\nsee a revival of the nuclear option\u201d, he\npredicts. \u201cThe UK government is moving forward once again with plans for\ndeep disposal of nuclear waste, which\nis certainly a good sign\u201d, he adds with\na smile.\nDynamic though the EWRE Section\nmay be, it doesn\u2019t have a monopoly\non environmental activities within the\nCivil and Environmental Engineering\ndepartment. The Fluid Mechanics and\nTransport Sections also conduct cutting edge research on minimising the\nenvironmental impacts of the build\nenvironment.\nEnvironmental Fluid Mechanics\nDrGaryHunt,readerinFluidMechanics, and his research group are working in the area of natural ventilation\nof buildings. Winner of an award for\nenergy efficient buildings in the 2007\nAustralian Engineering Excellence\nAwards, Dr Hunt argues that the gains\nfrom naturally ventilated buildings significantly prevail over traditional alternatives such as air conditioning, while\nmaking a substantial contribution to\nthe protection of the environment.\n\u201cYou can forget about not leaving your\nTVs on standby, when CO2\nemissions\nfrom buildings can be reduced by as\nmuch as 20% just by improving their\nenergy efficiency\u201d explained Dr Hunt\nin an Environmental Fluid Mechanics\nlecture earlier this month. Indeed, it\nis estimated that naturally ventilated\nbuildings typically consume less than\na third of the energy used in a comparable air-conditioned building, making\nnatural ventilation an attractive option\nfor the future.\nCentre for Transport Studies\nThe Centre for Transport Studies is\nalso undertaking a wide range of research in environmental areas, includ-ingactiveinvolvementintheGrantham\nInstitute for Climate Change. Another\nhigh-profile collaboration involves the\ndevelopment of a mobile environmental sensing system to monitor urban\nair pollution, aid in informing travellers and improving traffic management\n(www.message-project.org). Recent\nstudies have included an evaluation\nof the impact of aviation on climate\nchange and the development of an onboard vehicle emissions monitoring\nsystem. \"Real world emission rates are\nsubstantially different from those seen\non the standard regulatory tests\" says\nDr Robin North. \"These techniques allow us to assess how actual traffic patterns and driver behaviour affect emissions from road transport\".\nIn this ongoing battle against climate\nchange, civil and environmental engineers can proudly boast of their unique\nrole. In their absence, any decisions\nmade by the \u2018powerful\u2019 of the world\ncan only, at best, remain on paper, leaving targets unmet and desired results\nunachieved. The research currently\nbeing performed at Imperial strives to\nmake the profession even more valuable to society by providing members\nof the engineering community around\nthe world with cutting-edge knowl-edge. When this knowledge is used\nproperly, it can achieve breathtaking\nresults which rarely pass unnoticed.\nFor more information, see www.\ncv.imperial.ac.uk\nEnergy inefficiency. Pretty, I'll grant you, and possibly a sign of a healthy economy, but not much good for\nthe environment \u2013 how many of these buildings are naturally ventilated do you think?\nC\nan scientists dance?\nWhile it is a question that\nhas surely kept Nobel laureates awake at night for\nyears, anyone who has\never witnessed the closing dinner at a\nscientific conference will know with\nsome confidence that the answer is\nno. Now Christoph Campregher and\nNilay Yapici of the Medical University\nof Vienna, offer further evidence in the\nform of the world\u2019s first \u201cDance your\nPh.D.\u201d competition.\nTwelve international teams of rhythmically inclined scientists travelled to\nVienna for the intellectual hoedown.\nThe goal of the contest was for the\nscientists to express their doctoral research in the language of dance for an\naudience of several hundred of their\ndrunken colleagues. With the scientific\nspecialities of the participants covering\nareas as diverse and abstract as the evolution of galaxies and gene regulation,\nthis posed a serious test of the artistic\nimaginations of the teams. Thankfully,\nScience magazine was there with a video camera to record the extravaganza\nfor later analysis.\nExpert advice was on hand with\njudges including a professional dancer\nand a science communicator and with\nscientific rigour assured by the presence of Michel Breger, professor of astrophysics at the University of Vienna.\nThe fourth judge, Karl Grammer, is a\nprofessor of anthropology and an expert on the evolution of dance. The\nauthor of such articles as \u201cCharisma\nCam: A prototype of an intelligent digital sensory organ for virtual humans\u201d,\nhe is clearly no stranger to the more\nobscure parts of the interface of science and the humanities, but even so\nhe must surely have hoped some of\nthe mutant dance offspring on display\nwere on a rapid road to extinction.\nPerhaps it is not fair to judge people\nwho have spent years stuck in the lab\non their physical prowess and the dancers cannot be faulted for the creativity\nand diversity evident in their choreog-raphy, but many of the performances\ncould certainly do with a further few\nmore years of intensive study. Some\nof the contestants did manage a display of vigorous physicality but grace\nand coordination were noticeably ab-sent, replaced instead by the rigid hips\nand shoulders so characteristic of the\ngeek in motion. Quite how some of the\ndancers arrived at their moves is also\nmysterious. For instance, Sven Ramelow\u2019s interpretation of \u201cSingle photon\nupconversion\u201d more closely resembled\nan enraged beast attempting to escape\nfrom a sack than particle physics.\nThe most unfairly overlooked entrant was Josef Penninger, director of\nthe Austrian Institute of Molecular\nBiotechnology. With impressive devotion to the mad scientist stereotype\nand apparently a total disregard for his\nscientific reputation, the wild-haired\nand football shirted Prof impressed\nwith a piece featuring both a double\ncartwheel and strong elements of the\nchicken dance. Another notable loser\nwas Simone Recchi whose high-ener-gy recreation of the \"Dynamical and\nchemical evolution of blue compact\ndwarf galaxies\", looking rather like an\nover-caffeinated child at a wedding\ndisco, came in only mid-table despite\nthe rousing support of the crowd.\nOverall winner Brian Stewart, a pal-aeoanthropologist from the University of Oxford, was clearly in a league\nof his own with his exploration of the\nresource gathering strategies of prehistoric man. Remarkably he managed to\nincorporate rhythm, style and a great\ntune (a Herbie Hancock interpretation\nof African Pygmy music [Watermelon\nMan \u2013 Ed]) in a funky dance that was\nalmost educational. The fact that the\nbuff boffin was also clad only in a shiny\nloincloth no doubt also helped.\nExplaining a doctoral thesis verbally\nto the layman is difficult enough a task,\nbut doing so without words must surely require an exceptional degree of skill\nand clarity of thinking. While the fancy\nfootwork of this group of scientists is\nunlikely to trouble Strictly Come\nDancing on a Saturday night perhaps\nit is time for Imperial to consider dance\ninterpretation as a viable alternative to\nthe viva for examination of a Ph.D. the-sis. Judge for yourself at http://tinyurl.\ncom/yuzn7c . (Or, for those who prefer big urls, www.sciencemag.org/cgi/\ncontent/full/319/5865/905b)\nStrictly come off it! A science dance-off?\nExplaining their PhD research verbally isn't enough for this lot: they do it through dance. Tim Sands reports\nMirrors mirrors on the ball: who's got the best research dance of all?\n\n"

The physical\ndemands of match-play will rely heavily on your carbohydrate stores and so\ngood nutritional practices should be\nan essential part of self-preparation in\nyour sport.\nPlayers who eat well during the\ntraining week are likely to have adequate carbohydrate stores to last them\nthrough a match. Do this by increasing your intake of carbohydrates such\nas cereal, bread, honey, jam, potatoes,\nrice, pasta etc for a few days prior to\nthe match and try to spread your food\nand drink over 5-6 smaller portioned\nmeals a day. Avoid the intake of high\nfats such as cheese, rich sauces, takea-ways, crisps and chocolate. Also try to\nincrease the amount of fluids you take\nsuch as water, sports drinks (4-8% car-bohydrate), cordial and juices. As your\nmuscle stores water as well as glyco-gen. You should avoid alcohol 24-48\nhours before a match.\nEat a high carbohydrate meal the\nnight before the match such as:\n\u2022 Pasta with a tomato based or low\nfat sauce with a small amount of lean\nmeat, chicken or fish if desired.\n\u2022 Stir-fry with lots of rice, noodles or\ncouscous. \u2013 Homemade not from your\nlocal takeaway!\n\u2022 Small serving of very lean meat,\nchicken or fish with plenty of potatoes\nand vegetable/salad.\nApproximately 4-5 hours before the\nmatch eat a suitable pre-match meal.\nChoose something that is easily digestible and also something you have eaten\nbefore consisting of carbohydrates\nand fluids. Examples are cereals, fruit,\nbread, muffins, crumpets, pancakes\nwith honey, jam or syrup, pasta or rice\nwith a low fat topping. Small snacks\nsuch as fruit, bread or a meal replacement drink can be consumed up to 2\nhours before the match kick off.\nFluid intake should not be underestimated as dehydration will impair\nskill and judgement and makes exercise seem harder than it actually is.\nYou need to start each game hydrated\nand work at drinking fluid regularly\nthroughout the game e.g. breaks in\nplay, time outs etc. Avoid excess caffeine before the match as it may lead\nto dehydration and cause stomach\ncramps.\nRecovery is just as important as the\npreparation and will ensure you can be\nfully ready for your next training ses-sion. Recovery should start immediately after the final whistle blows by replacing your carbohydrate stores with\nfluids and food such as sports drinks,\ncordials, fruits \u2013 watermelon, pineap-ple, white bread sandwiches and some\ncereal bars.\nSensible intake of alcohol after a\nmatch will not impair future performances but be aware that drinking\nalcohol before following a suitable recovery plan can compromise recovery\nand drinking excessive alcohol can\ndecrease attempts to improve body\ncomposition.\nTo complete a full recovery, eat a\nproper meal containing carbohydrate-rich foods such as potatoes, pasta, rice,\nnoodles etc with some protein such as\nchicken, meat or fish. Remember that\nfast foods such as chicken kebab and\nchips may taste good but are high in\nfat \u2013 even with the salad, so not at all\nuseful for your recovery.\nGood luck to all teams for next week\u2019s\nvarsity matches!\nAll the pre- and post-match\nnutrition you could need\nSquash\nICU Men\u2019s 1st 5\nUniversity of Surrey Men\u2019s 1st 0\nTennis\nICU Men\u2019s 2nd 10\nQueen Mary Men\u2019s 2nd 0\nVolleyball\nICU Women\u2019s 1st 3\nSt. John & St. Mark Women\u2019s 1st 1\nMonday 25th February\nBasketball \u2013 ULU\nICU Men\u2019s 1st vs Queen Mary Men\u2019s 1st\nNetball \u2013 ULU\nICU 3rd vs RUMS 4th\nHolly Plumley\nEnergia Fitness Instructor\nPasta and a tomato base\nStir-fry with noodles\nSmall serving of lean meat\nDear Felix Sports Editor,\nThe following text was found on scrap paper lying on a FirstGreatWestern train service this Wednesday.

Geek\nA day in the life of a corporate sell-out\nI\nhad the misfortune of being in\nCanary Wharf the other day.\nActually, that doesn\u2019t entirely\nexplain it. I went to Canary\nWharf the other day. I went to\nsee A Bank. About A Job. I realise that\nas you flick through your Angry Geek\nscrapbook tonight and re-read past\ncolumns you may notice some intense\nfrustration and anger towards those\nthat hop on the Gravy Eurostar to\nthe Cayman Islands. If I was the kind\nof guy who defended himself against\nthings like hypocrisy, I\u2019d probably tell\nyou that the reason I went was that I\nfelt honour-bound to see first-hand\nthat which I hate so much, and that the\nfact that I didn\u2019t turn up to the following day\u2019s aptitude tests show this. But I\ncould give a toss what you think, so I\u2019m\nnot going to.\nIn case you\u2019re interested, two things\nstruck me about Canary Wharf and\nthose that work there. First of all, it is\ncompletely cut off from reality in every\nway possible. Even within a single office building there are launderettes,\ngyms, banks, beds, bars, and the like.\nCanary Wharf itself isn\u2019t so much littered with high-risers as it is walled by\nthem \u2013 they block out the unsightly\nsmudges of London itself, unless you\nare so high up in one of them that the\nbuildings and people just blend into\npart of the landscape below.\nThe second, and perhaps more wor-rying, thing I noticed is that no-one\nseems aware of this whatsoever. I\nstood outside the Reuters building for\nthree quarters of an hour in the early\nevening, and I watched the traders,\nsellers, and support staff drink and\nmake merry like they were in a Hollywood film. The reason they don\u2019t\nmiss the world outside is because this\nis their world \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t bother\nthem. They\u2019ve grown used to it, and\nnow it\u2019s all they need.\nI don\u2019t know why this hit me in the\nway it did, but there was something\nimmediately jarring about it. I couldn\u2019t\nbear the thought of returning to the\nWharf after having left it, because it\nmade me feel cold inside: as if one of\nthe enormous what-are-these-guys-compensating-for-anyway skyscrapers\nwas harbouring the Eye of Sauron at its\ntop. Yet despite all of my reservations,\nthese people have learnt to live with\nit, and they feel none of the remorse\nor regret that I wished upon them\nwhatsoever.\nBack at University, I\u2019m currently undertaking a project sufficiently large\nso as to make weekends more or less\na nonentity, a phenomenon familiar to\nanyone reading this, I\u2019m sure. Clearly,\nno Maths students read this anyways.\nIt dawned on me the other day that the\nproject was progressing in a depressing cycle. I would reach something that\nhadn\u2019t been explained. I would ask a\nstaff member, who would demonstrate\nthe concept for me. I would take down\nwhat he said, and then move on to the\nnext thing that hadn\u2019t been explained\nproperly. It\u2019s not that I wasn\u2019t learning anything. After all, I learnt what he\ntold me. But when you put phrases like,\n\u201cfifth best in the world\u201d, \u201cmasters of\nscience\u201d, or, you know, \u201cengendering a\nsense of discovery and enlightenment\namongst the most talented young individuals in the world\u201d, then the idea of\nusing a Professor as an extremely slow\nalternative to Wikipedia seems not\nonly to be taking the piss, but loading it\ninto a piss-cannon and pissing it right\nback all over my face.\nSo. It\u2019s election time down at Imperial and people want you to be enthusiastic all over again. The first years\nmight still care, but I sure as shit\ncouldn\u2019t. Not just because I\u2019ve gone\nand stared into the abyss, and had the\nabyss stare back at me, but because\nfuck me, what\u2019s the point? What do\nyou care if someone wants to make the\nblades of grass on the Beit Quad lawn\ngreener? You couldn\u2019t give a shit, that\u2019s\nwhy people are so apathetic about their\nfuture \u2013 the present is too dull to keep\ntheir attention.\nI\u2019m not a fan of one of the candidates.\nSo the plan this week is simply this \u2013\ndon\u2019t vote. Don\u2019t vote, and try and get\ntheir attention that way. It doesn\u2019t work\nif you vote a tit in. It doesn\u2019t work if you\nvote a minority in. The only way you\u2019ll\never get anyone to take any notice is if\nyou break the system in the first place.\nAnd while you\u2019re not voting \u2013 go\nand register for the London Mayoral\nElection. Because that\u2019s a community\nworth making an effort for.\nMmm, I love the sight of skyscrapers and the smell of briefcases in the morning\n\u201c\nthese people\nhave learnt to\nlive with it, and\nthey feel none\nof the remorse\nor regret\nthat I wished\nupon them\nwhatsoever\n\u201d\nH\nello all. If you\u2019ve just\njoined us, do please\ntake a seat. The week\nbefore last, Jonas Neubert, who I do believe is\ninvolved with the ICU Fair Trade Society, posted a rebuttal to an article I\nwrote the week before, where I damned\nFair Trade for not tackling global poverty properly. Whilst I anticipated that\nthis would generate some backlash, I\nwas at least hoping my point wouldn\u2019t\nbe lost entirely. For those who want a\nmore in-depth argument by a seasoned\neconomist, I\u2019d encourage you to read\nthe article Grounds for Complaint by\nBrink Lindsey, which covers more issues than I have space for.\nJonas alleges that Fair Trade is compatible with free market economics.\nFrom a consumer point of view this is\nlargely true. However, he ignores the\nseller\u2019s perspective. Fair Trade ignores\nthe market rate of coffee and gives its\nfarmers an uncompetitive rate above\nwhat the market demands. Market\nprices fluctuate according to supply\nand demand. Low price is oversupply\n(buyers have the advantage); high price\nshows scarcity power (sellers have the\nadvantage). One only needs to do some\nrudimentary research to find the supply of coffee beans in the past 10 years\nhas been constantly outstripping consumption by a wide margin. This will\ndrive the price down. And this is, un-fortunately, entirely fair. It is a signal\nthat acts to both curb supply and raise\ndemand. It signals to farmers to stop\nmaking it and make other products\ninstead. Third World farmers do often\nnot have this option, due to fierce (and\nunfair) competition in other markets.\nFair Trade works a little like a donation on top of a product, which is\nwhere it gets its intrinsic extra value\nover other products. This doesn\u2019t really stop poverty any more than donating money directly to homeless people\nprevents homelessness. Short term, it\nhelps. In the long term it just encourages them to get more donations. That\nmeans producing Fair Trade coffee and\nnot finding a better living. I don\u2019t want\nfarmers to become reliant on charity,\nguilt, and false economies.\nThis is not my primary worry, how-ever. If it were just pure charity, then\nit would only affect Fair Trade farm-ers. My main worry is that whilst Fair\nTrade helps its own farmers, others\nwho are independent are sliding further into poverty, due to their customers fleeing to more \u2018ethical\u2019 products.\nI would argue that non-Fair Trade\nfarmers need the money more than\nthey do. Fair Trade propaganda loves\nconcentrating on how their farmers\nhave better lives. It makes me want to\nscream out: at whose expense? By buying normal coffee, you\u2019re increasing\ndemand for the product the poorest\nfarmers make. I\u2019d argue that either one\nwould benefit someone. Fair Trade has\nno extra intrinsic value: it is just unabashed prejudice for their farmers over\nothers. In a lot of ways it ruins the very\npeople they are supposed to help: the\nmore people buy Fair Trade, the less\nnon-Fair Trade coffee being bought,\nand the more non-Fair Trade farmers\nare put out business.\nI do have a solution, and that involves\ngiving every farmer a better chance\nat a new life. Currently they face stiff\ncompetition from Europe and the US\nbecause governments pay farmers to\nexist, and block Third World trade.\nWe already have an advantage through\nbetter knowledge and access to capital.\nLet the costs add up and people will decide for themselves what is worth paying for. My guess is that Third World\nfarmers will have a distinct advantage\nwith low wages and land costs, giving\nthem a deservedly thriving industry,\nindependent of charity.\nMeddling in market economics is\nsomething to be done with extreme\ncaution, and can cause more problems\nthan it fixes. I stand by my original\npoint, that better economic mobility is\nthe real solution, and it is one I believe\ncould be within Fair Trade\u2019s remit. Directing Fair Trade premiums towards\nhelping farmers start a new life, rather\nthan sustain and reward an overcrowded industry, would be a move I\u2019d generously applaud. Even better, you should\nsend a strongly worded letter to your\nlocal MEP and let them know how you\nfeel.\nUn-Fair Trade\nMatt the Hat\nFair Trade: just a method of donation cleverly disguised?\n\n"

Apparently he was a precocious child, and\nspent his younger years reading Ancient Greek. He was the first member\nof parliament to call for women to be\ngiven the vote, which certainly deserves\na pat on the back. Interesting facts: his\ngodfather was Jeremy Bentham, whose\nbody can be found in a box at UCL (the\nhead attached to it is wax \u2013 they keep\nthe real deal tucked away so students\ndon\u2019t play with it), and Mill in turn was\ngodfather to Bertrand Russell, who was\na philosopher, political activist, math-ematician, winner of a Nobel Prize in\nLiterature, and all-round intellectual.\nSee? You\u2019re learning things today!\nMoving swiftly on, we come to Henry James (1843-1916), previous inhabitant of 34 De Vere Gardens. This dude\nCromwell Road is a bit of a trek, I\u2019m\nafraid, but you get the two-for-one offer of Sir Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980)\nat 153 and Benjamin Britten (1913-1976) at 173. The iconic director that is\nHitchcock requires little introduction,\nbut somebody really needs to tidy up\nhis ex-front garden, which resembles\nthe contents of a skip. Despite being\nconsidered the best director of all time,\ndid you know the poor guy never won\nan Oscar for his directing? Benjamin\nBritten is a well-known composer. He\ncreated, amongst rafts of other things,\nThe Young Person\u2019s Guide to the Orchestra and Winter Requiem.\nBack towards College we have T.S.\nEliot (1888-1965), who lived at 3\nKensington Court Gardens. You will\nknow him best as the poet who wrote\nOld Possom\u2019s Book of Practical Cats,\nnow best known in the musical Cats,\nthough he did write more serious poetry as well. It just so happens that Eliot\nalso lived in my home town, and my\nhouse in primary school was named\nafter him (we wore yellow PE kits, in\ncase you wondered).\nAnother gold mine for plaques was\nKensington Square, near Kensington\nHigh Street. It was here I discovered it\u2019s\nnot just British Heritage that produce\nplaques. Another plaque-mounting\norganisation is The Heritage Foundation, which celebrates mostly comedians and TV stars. Their website isn\u2019t as\ncomprehensive as British Heritage, but\nis still worth a look. I found a plaque\nfor Joan Sims (1930-2001), Carry On\nstar, placed by them. At 41 Kensington\nSquare there\u2019s Sir Edward Burne-Jones\n(1833-1898), a Pre-Raphaelite artist\nand chum of William Morris, of whom\nI am a big fan. In fact, Morris had a bit\nof a crush on Mrs Georgiana BurneJones, but she rejected him. This didn\u2019t\nstop Edward having an affair with his\nGreek model, who then caused a spot\nof scandal by trying to publicly commit\nsuicide. Ah... I love the eccentricities\nof artists, don\u2019t you? At 17 Kensington Square we\u2019ve got Hubert Parry\n(1848-1918), composer of everybody\u2019s\nfavourite song, Jerusalem, the lyrics of\nwhich were written by the poet William Blake. Over at number 17 there\u2019s\na plaque for the philosopher and MP\nwas an influential writer. You may have\nheard of The Portrait of a Lady and\nThe Wings of a Dove, two of his novels.\nThe Turn of the Screw, was turned into\nan opera by Benjamin Britten, who we\nvisited earlier. Nearby at 2 Palace Gate\nwe have Sir John Everett Millais (1829-1896), a Pre-Raphaelite chum of Sir\nEdward Burne-Jones (have you been\npaying attention?), and subject of the\nfirst article I ever wrote for Felix.\nThere are a few famous names on\nHyde Park Gate. At number 9 there\u2019s\nRobertBaden-Powell(1857-1941),selfproclaimed Chief Scout of the world,\nand possible paedophile (I refer you to\nthe whole Wikipedia article dedicated\nto \u201cRobert Baden-Powell\u2019s sexual orientation\u201d). At number 29 there\u2019s Enid\nBagnold (1889-1981), who wrote National Velvet. Nearby there\u2019s the controversial sculptor Sir Jacob Epstein\n(1880-1959). Sir Winston Churchill\n(1874-1965), possibly the most famous\nBriton of all time, lived and died at\nnumber 28. 22 Hyde Park Gate got me\nvery excited because it has not one, not\ntwo, but THREE blue plaques. Sir Leslie Stephen (1832-1904), author and\ncritic lived here. So did his children\nVanessa Bell (1879-1961), painter and\ninterior designer, and the great literary figure Virginia Woolf (1882-1941).\nNumber 22 is also a beautiful building,\nwhich I would very much like to live in\n(please).\nNever fear, reader, for the end is in\nsight! We\u2019re on to our last plaque! Possibly the closest of all to College, it\u2019s\nstuck on the side of Albert Hall Mansions. It\u2019s dedicated to Sir Malcolm\nSargent (1895-1967), a conductor, organist and composer. He is possibly the\nbest known of all English conductors,\nin fact. No prizes for guessing where\nhe did most of his conducting. So there\nwe are: a whistlestop tour of your local\nblue plaques. Even if you don\u2019t go looking for them yourself, I hope you\u2019ve at\nleast found my little tour educational.\nI bet you didn\u2019t realise there were so\nmany famous faces lining the route to\nyour lectures. And maybe, if you work\nhard like good little students, the grotty\nlittle flat full of empty beer bottles you\ncall home will someday have its own\nblue plaque with your name on it.\nFor beaucoup de information,\nvisit www.english-heritage.org.uk\nWinston Churchill lived and died on Imperial\u2019s doorstep, sort of\nThe famous painting of Ophelia by Millais, another Imperial neighbour Scouts: invented and fiddled by Robert Baden-Powell.

So\nmaybe we might get to see some drastic improvements in the validity of solar power in the coming decade.\nAnyway I\u2019ll let you get on with our\nnice big Loudspeaker article and a top-up on the whole HD-DVD thing.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nTechnology\nTechnology Editor \u2013 James Finnerty\nJames Finnerty\nTechnology Editor\nN\nowadays, there is no\ndoubt that consumers\nare increasingly aware\nof high-definition video,\nmainly due to the ongoing battle between Blu-ray and HD\nDVD \u2013 the two next-gen HD video\nformats. However, it is uncommon to\nhear about high definition audio: the\nmarket is flooded by low-grade digital\nmusic, as well as low-resolution loudspeakers that can still sell because consumers believe the wattage is the main\nfeature. Should you care?\nTo answer this, imagine you are sitting in front of a jazz band: somewhere\non the left you can feel the plucking\nand hear the delicate reverb of the guitar strings, and right in front of you\ncome the saxophones and the trumpets\ntickling your ear canals, along with the\ntrombones that gently shake your entire body, and the piano with tones that\ncomfortably fade away. This is what\nyou should look out for in a concert \u2013\nthere is no way you can reproduce the\nsame sensation back at home, unless\nyou have the money to hire the band\nplus the ownership of the same concert\nhall and making it your home. This is\nwhere the challenge is: can you bring\na similar sensation back to your actual\nhome?\nIf you are one of those who have\ntaken up the challenge, you are then\nknown as an audiophile. Most audiophiles swear by analogue playback,\nwhich include the use of vacuum tube\namplifiers with vinyl record players,\nand most refuse to go digital wherever\npossible due to their belief in the lack of\nwarmth (or even soul, as said by many\naudiophiles) in digital formats and\ndevices, even though current technology proves otherwise. Ignoring all the\ndigital audio devices, the audiophiles\u2019\nabsolute latest favourite technology\nwould probably be the superior yet\nless-known electrostatic loudspeakers\n(ESLs) \u2013 essentially flat panel speakers,\ndefinitely nothing close to your ordinary speakers. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised\nif you have not heard of this technology before, but trust me, they are way\nbetter than what most of us are using\nright now.\nSo what is wrong with our everyday\nmagnetic coil speakers? Well, placing\none in your hand, you would immediately notice its heavy weight due to\nthe magnet and metallic coil (usually\nhidden). This actually kills any delicate\nsignals \u2013 such as the tiny reverb of the\npiano \u2013 in a well-recorded soundtrack.\nUnlike the average consumer, any experienced audiophiles would be able to\nspot these tiny missing details. There\nis then the coil-driven motion of the\ndriver: to reproduce sound, the inner\ncoil and the diaphragm constantly are\npushed in and out to change the air\npressure around it. Such large movements will easily distort the sound,\nand on top of that, a large diffraction\nis also introduced to the sound waves\ndue to the shape of the cone, therefore\nallowing the sound quality and volume to deteriorate very quickly over a\nshort distance. This is why audiophiles\nalways have to carefully find the socalled \u201csweet spot\u201d before they can sit\ndown for three hours or so of music.\nLooking at a bigger picture, a complete speaker requires a cabinet \u2013 usually wooden \u2013 to go with the magnetic\ncoil drivers. This is to prevent destructive interference by the sound waves\nproduced from the back of the drivers,\nas well as making the bass punchier.\nHowever, this often adds unnecessary\nflavour to the reproduced sound, which\ndefeats the whole objective of hi-fi, or\nhigh fidelity, meaning close-to-original\nI think you would be more likely to get your wife to approve this than a a set of 6-foot tall monsters\nreproduction. Some people may like\nthis additional flavour, but the veterans\nare strictly allergic to it.\nTo understand how ESLs defeat such\nproblems, we should look at the general structure of them: originally designed by Quad Electroacoustics of UK\nin 1955, these flat panel speakers consist of a polarised plastic diaphragm\nNakamichi HD-A ESL\n\n"

Saladin\u2019s devilish reverse stick skills fooled\neven the wisest of opponents. Since\nthen the bloodshed has been replaced\nwith beer and as a consequence we all\nget home safelyish! Oddly enough, the\nhockey skill hasn\u2019t much changed.\nLast year\u2019s great success in Operation\nMarket Garden meant that the threat\nhad been subdued in Holland and full\nattention could be given to the ever-aggressive Ireland. The unsuspecting\ncitizens of Belfast wouldn\u2019t have a clue\nwhat hit them, leaving us to reign supreme in all the British Isles.\nOur journey began at a mind-bog-gling 5am after a pre-hockey tour bar\nnight to generate good feeling among\nthe troops. Our first casualty of war\nwas Sangy Sangy Sangy Sang-eeeSang-eee-Sang, who had failed to get\nup after what could only be described\nas a sickening blow to the liver. Soon\nto follow was Melmin who through\nquick-witted thinking and skill retrieved the contents of her stomach in\nher coat hood.\nUndeterred by these early setbacks\nwe set off by the cover of darkness\nacross the Irish sea, setting up camp\nat Paddy\u2019s Palace, carefully selected for\nits proximity to the water (well beer)\nsupply of Queen\u2019s College Union.\nThere was need for much preparation before a full assault on the City\ncould be made. A platoon, led by resident Chef/Lieutenant Spam-a-Lot,\nwent out in search of supplies and then\nprepared a meal fit for kings with help\nfrom the Chinese Consultant Wiltshire\n(for the rice). While spirits were high\na trip to the range(Bowling Alley) was\nmade to hone the skills for the next\nday\u2019s eploits. Jemima Holes\u2019 taking out\nof a turkey was awarded by an instant\npromotion to Corporal and Wankin\nknown more for his err intelligence\nrole in this operation was consigned to\nnon-automatic weapons.\nAfter more split pins than Fish\u2019s\nnether regions a recon exercise to the\nUnion was made. We were surprised\nto enter unhindered at the main gates\nand like a Trojan Horse we slipped\nthrough and found ourselves in an Art\nDeco underground lair. We found that\nthis conquest may not be so difficult as\npints were \u00a31.60 and soon found ourselves on the inebriated side of blad-dered. We fled before our cover was\nblown, only to find the next day that\nthe union had been closed down due\nto having run out of beer. Special Ops\nteam Velvet and Fish went on to the\ngarage for further recon, unfortunately\nstraying into an unprotected zone, Fish\nwas stalked home while Velvet was\nlicked by a man.\nAt the crack of noon on Saturday,\nthe Battlegroup split, half recruiting\nfreedom fighters on a black cab tour\nof Belfast, half collecting ammunitions from the stores in the centre. At\n1400 hours we reconvened at our first\nbattleground and a manic battle commenced on the uneven terrain of crazy\ngolf. Sangy Sangy etc nearly took out a\ncivilian from a pot shot across the river.\nGayve has an awesome kill count, yet\ncried over getting his iron rations(malt\nloaf) mixed up with a plum loaf. Timmaaaaay had to deal with cocky young\nupstart, Slushie and played a kamikaze\nroll of aiming for his ball to teach him a\nthing or two (you\u2019re not in the air force\nnow, boy).\nFranpiss, one of the not-so-very-quick-witted recruits almost lost her\nkit by failing to realise that running\nmight help and simply saying \u201csome\none stop him\u201d, *dramatic pause* \u201che\nhas my bag\u201d was enough.\nAfter this great success, we quickly\nmoved on and took on Ireland in a full\nfrontal attack, and no I\u2019m not talking\nTimothy Harford-cross about Man Hands getting her baps\nout (that was later), but hockey. The\nBelfast Harlequins, a ferocious team of\ncrazy Celts came to field of battle but\nat the sight of the RSM three defected\nimmediately pledging there allegiance\nto us. With this, our heads were high\nand hearts were proud and we bore\ndown against the locals. Urinal did a\nbrilliant job at controlling the game yet\nfailed to time the second half, after approximately an hour, both teams col-lapsed, well, Little Miss Dislocation did\nand we stretchered her off. Btw: the\nscore was 5-3 to us. Rear Guard gunner Velvet got the Victoria Cross for\nhis bravery and Gayve got dishonour-ably discharged for kicking the keeper.\nA surrendering Irish force lead us to\nthe bar and allowed us to collect sup-plies. Replenished with victory/beer\nwe returned to camp.\nSergent Meat Head led the onslaught\nonto Eglantine, the final target of the\ninvasion, a menacing \u00a36 for a jug of\ncocktail (Molotov or otherwise) bombarded our table, but that did not deter us, Tampon soaking up most of the\nfire. Chaplain Jeboobs kept the faith\nbut was not in time to stop the morally\nobjectionable Air Strike by Lt. Spamo-lot and Little Miss Dislocation.\nAs Major General, I would just like\nto add: very well done chaps, the operation was a complete success and has\ngiven paddy something to think about.\nI think that this has given us all good\nexperience and you are my top trumps.\nNow don\u2019t just go and forget the lesson\nwe\u2019ve learned, SAY NO TO STEVE.\nThe fixtures are likely to be a bit less friendly than this pair\nFace\nOff\nVarsity and Bottle Match\npreviews, see page 45\n\n"

Fundamental changes to the way\nthe NUS works will be debated and if\npassed will represent a major reform\nof the organisation making it less likely\nthat financial crisis and political irrelevance will prevent it from delivering\nfor students. Imperial College Union\nhas been one of over 40 Unions driving\nthese reforms and I have been a strong\nsupporter of this policy. For a delegate\nwho will represent the views of Imperial students and report back on what\nhappens in Blackpool VOTE JEN for\nNUS Delegate.\nJennifer Morgan\nI voted no to joining the NUS because\nI could not see that the \u00a344,000 a year\nfee was justified. In fact, even after attending the NUS Extraordinary Conference last term, I am still dubious as\nto where the students of Imperial are\nbenefitting.\nHowever I really want to represent\nImperial at conference because I think\nthat we need to contribute to and get\nas much out of it as we can. I want to\nhelp Imperial students see results from\nConference. This is a huge task but it\nstarts by improving communication\nbetween the NUS delegates and the\nstudents.\nVictoria Gibbs\nFollowing some great comedy, but awful debate, at the NUS extraordinary\nconference last December, I voted and\nsaw the passing of the Governance Review. I want to see this voted through\nagain. I want to be there to vote it\nthrough. Imperial deserves better than\nthe current NUS farce. Students deserve better. Without the governance\nreview, this won\u2019t happen and it will\ncontinue to be a playground for aspiring socialist hacks and their \u2018free pet\ncare for students\u2019 motions. The NUS\nshould deal with student issues, not\nstudents creating them, so vote Liz for\nthe sensible logic found at Imperial!\nLiz Hyde Chris Larvin\nEach year we spend \u00a344,000 of our sub-vention in affiliation fees to the NUS\nand it\u2019s very hard to quantify what benefits we receive from this considerable\nsum. It is important ICU gets value for\nmoney by attending conferences and\ngiving input, where appropriate, on issues that affect Imperial students. The\nstudents at Imperial are often special\ncases in that they are studying science,\ntechnology and medicine that live and\nstudy in London. I don\u2019t care for antiwar or other Trot motions; I just care\nabout the motions that affect Imperial students, so vote Chris for NUS\ndelegate.\nJohn Matthews\nThe NUS claims to speak for us, but\nthey can only when we tell them what\nwe want them to say. With guidance\nfrom Council on which way to vote,\nsome may question what difference\nit makes who is elected to form the\ndelegation. There are few motions on\nwhich delegates must vote a particular\nway, but many where a delegate can\nvote differently with just cause. We\nneed to elect delegates that will maintain the interest of Imperial students\nand work to ensure that the NUS works\nfor us and delivers what we need.\nKirsty Patterson Camilla Royle Rosie Smithells\nWhat are NUS Delegates and\nwhat are they for?\nICU\u2019s Delegates to the NUS Annual\nConference 2008 will be voting on\nthe radical restructuring of the NUS\nthat caused controversy last year. The\nstudents that are elected as delegates\nessentially act as a puppets controlled\nby the ICU Council, and must vote as\nmandated by Council Policy. This is\nto ensure that ICU NUS Delegates act\naccording to the will of the entire Imperial student body, not according to\ntheir pet interest.\nHowever, at a time when the future\nof the NUS is hotly debated, the only\noutcome of the coming conference is\nlikely to be the ratification or rejection of the restructuring; ICU is still\nuncertain as to whether it wishes to be\naffiliated with the national institution.\nNever before has the ICU delegation\nbeen more important to the NUS and\nto the Union\nI have attended two NUS Conferences\nin the past year and am familiar with\nthe procedures of the NUS. As a member of the NUS Working Group I am\nwriting amendments for Conference\nbased on research that I have under-taken. As a familiar face in the NUS I\nwill gain support amongst other delegations to change the NUS into a union that is relevant to our needs and of\ngreater benefit to our members in the\nfuture. I believe I am the Candidate\nwith the most experience, the appropriate knowledge and the most influ-ence. Mwu ha ha cough cough...\nI\u2019m a final year biology student who\u2019s\nalso spent much of the last three\nyears campaigning on various issues\n(anti-war/anti-fascist/women\u2019s lib/\nanti-climate change etc). I oppose the\nnew NUS governance review because I\nthink it diminishes many of the democratic structures that make it possible\nfor ordinary students like me to go to\nconference in the first place. The way\nto improve the NUS is to get more students involved and run campaigns that\npeople care about so we want to stay\naffiliated not to cut back on activism.\nVote for me to represent this alternative point of view.\nThe Union operates a \u2018whipped vote\u2019 \u2013\nmeaning the way delegates vote on important issues to Imperial Students has\nalready been decided by NUS working\ngroup and ultimately Council \u2013 I\u2019m a\nmember of both.\nWhilst at Imperial I have been a Reapp, a member of several clubs, ICU\nsenior bar staff and RSM Treasurer;\nI\u2019m in touch with student issues so can\nvote sensibly when the vote is \u2018free\u2019 and\ngive real feedback on the conference.\nI voted \u2018NO\u2019 to the NUS but feel if\nwe must be a part of it then we should\nmaximise the benefit for our students.\nLuke Taylor and Salman Waqar\nfailed to submit manifestos\nVoting open: www.imperialcollegeunion.org/vote\nVoting open: www.imperialcollegeunion.org/vote\n\n"

The\nfollowing situations are not allowed:\nSquares are not allowed either. There\nare never cells containing the number\n4 in Slitherlink.\nSo, where do you start? The most\ncommon place to start on a Slitherlink grid is by drawing crosses\naround any zeros.

    "content": "film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n26 felix Friday 22 February 2008\nFilm\nFilm Editor \u2013 Alex Casey\nRambo: Beyond First Blood\nSo heroes never die, do they? Well, I\nsuppose this bombastic statement refers to more than actual beating heart\nand pulse, but whatever might be said\nabout other heroes, death seems to\nstay away from Rambo \u2013 in a manner\nof speaking.\nYou may have heard of him before,\nwhen he turned a whole town upside\ndown after being spitefully arrested;\nor when he went back into Vietnam to\nsave some POWs and ended up slaughtering a lot of despicable Vietnamese\nsoldiers; or when he travelled to Afghanistan to save the life of his friend\nand mentor. But seeing Sylvester Stallone have his way with the Burmese\narmy, twenty plus years since his first\nventure into the pure evil of this world,\nis a view to be relished by any action-fan, as it sets new standards in both\ndespicable villainy and righteous retribution of pain and suffering.\nIn the beginning of this very slick\nlooking jungle film, John Rambo seems\nto have contented himself with the\nserene life of a snake\ncatcher somewhere\nnear the border of\nBurma, where \u2013 we\nare told \u2013 a most\nterrible genocide is\ntaking place. Having been bluntly\ninformed of the\npurposeofthisfilm\nin the first minute,\nwe move on to its\nscope when a couple of army-sadists\nplay the Burmese\nversion of the\nhundred metres\nsprint, sending the\nunfortunate locals\nrunning through\ncrop fields ridden\nwith mines and the\nbets are on for who\nblows up first. Fast\nforward to good old\nRambo, who resides\nin a small camp where\nentertainment consists\nof a young lad doing a\none-on-one with a cobra.\nTo break the monotony of\nthe day, a couple of na\u00efve\nAmericans rock up needing Rambo to take them by\nboat into Burma, where they\nwant to help the locals. With\nJohn\u2019s sense of justice still dormant at this point of the film, he\ninitially refuses to help them, but\nis eventually persuaded by the sole\nwoman of the group, whose eloquent\nspeech about time and being seems to\nhit a chord with him. An exciting boat\nride later (during which we are offered\na glimpse of what is to come), the aid\nworkers barely get to \u201cmake a difference\u201d before the Burmese army storms\nWith Rocky having thrown his final punch, Sylvester Stallone jumps back into the\nshoes of bloodthirsty Rambo. For cynics and superfans alike, Felix goes in for the kill\nStefan Carpanu\nG\niven the pretty lacklustre\nturn out at the BAFTAs\nthe other week, I found\nmyselfthinkingthisweek\nabout the one thing that\nwon\u2019t be coming out this awards sea-son; stars.\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong - this isn\u2019t\nnecessarily a bad thing. Despite a fascinated interest in them - akin to what\nsome depressingly morbid people refer\nto as car crash interest - I do find the\nOscars a horribly anachronistic and\nawkward sight to behold. There would\nbe a certain amount of disappointment\nif they fully welcomed in foreign filmmakers as then there would be nothing\nto complain about. The whole point\nof awards when the winners are taken\ncare of is the pleasure of debate that\nthey evoke from people.\nHowever, it hasn\u2019t always been so.\nBetween the birth of the Oscars (1928)\nand the 1960s, as narrative cinema\nousted documentary and avant-garde\ncinema from the mainstream, Hollywood was born and the machine\ncreaked into operation. Not content\nwith providing monopoly filmmaking\nin the US, the machine sucked in European and British cinema as well to\ncreate the standard model almost as\nscientific as the quantum theory that\nwas being developed at similar times.\nThis was how stars were formed.\nUnder long (perhaps up to 7 years)\ncontracts, they moulded people who\nwould become household names - Greta Garbo, Bette Davis, Cary Grant, etc.\nThis wasn\u2019t a system for whiners: your\nstudio told you what to wear, when to\ngo to bed and who you could marry.\nHuman rights violation? Well, most of\nthem did alright out of it.\nThese names made the Oscars. In a\nday when you know everything about a\n\u2018star\u2019 and think their best performance\nin the last year was in an Armani ad,\nthe image rusts. Even the odd one who\ncould lay claim to any sense of mystery\nis compromised by the lack of any sense\nof \u2018Hollywood Community\u2019 that was as\nmuch a part of the dream. Knowing\nthat Marlene Dietrich and Rita Hayworth would be rubbing shoulders is a\nmuch more idyllic thought than thinking of George Clooney running away\nfrom Paris Hilton.\nAs for the films, as I\u2019ve already lambasted the arbitrariness of the whole\nprocess of awards shows - I could even\ngo further and shoot myself in the foot\nby questioning the need for critics - I\ncan concede that in a system where\nmost films being churned out are all-but-identical, the few that get noticed\nprobably had something different,\neven if it was just an angry Jack Warner\nblackmailing the voting Academy.\nThis is not in any way an interest-ing, unique or integrity-laden column.\nI apologise. It is simply the musing of\na cinephile who fancied a slight diver-tissement from a pretty boring week\nfor film. I don\u2019t normally subscribe to\nthe rose-tinted view of the so-called\nGolden Age that people hollowly\npraise as another example of how the\nworld has gone to shit. They certainly don\u2019t make them like they used to.\nThey make them better. But without\nRita and Marilyn.\nin, bombarding everything in its way\nand taking the survivors captive. When\nRambo finds out about this tragic turn\nof events (probably thinking to himself \u201cI told you so\u201d), he agrees to take a\ngroup of mercenaries on a rescue mission \u2013 and the action begins.\nThe film itself sins a\nlot, not only in\nterms of\nits ethically-charged content, but also\nthrough its almost laughable dialogues\nand generally uninventive script. It\u2019s\nhard to keep a straight face when Rambo utters things such as \u201clive for noth-ing, or die for something\u201d and actually\nmanages to motivate his fellow fighters \u2013 it\u2019s just bloody cheesy. But at\nninety minutes running time and\nthe rather rare occurrences\nof such chit-chats, it ends\nup being quite bearable,\nespecially in view of the\nmajestic payoff at the\nend of the film.\nThe fact is that, over-all, the movie looks\npretty fancy: either\n61-year-old Stallone\nhasdevelopedhisflair\nin directing, or he\u2019s\ngot a good cinema-tographer. The jungle appears lively and shines beautifully,\nreminiscent of Herzog\u2019s (so often\nmentioned of late) Aguirre or Fitzcarraldo, and I can but wonder whether\nit\u2019s just one of those things which have\nintrinsic beauty that you simply cannot\nmiss whenever you point the camera at\nthem.\nAs far as violence is concerned, I\ndon\u2019t believe to have ever seen a film\nas viciously bloody as this one. The\nbody count of three per minute probably says it all and anyone would have a\nhard job arguing that so much aggressiveness and bloodshed is justifiable.\nBut then again, you know what you\u2019re\ngoing into when entering the cinema to\nwatch Rambo and Stallone does have\nan actual reasoning behind the exces-siveness of it all - in that he acknowledges the need to exaggerate nowadays\nin order for anyone to take note. Some\nwill concede that the message the film\nbears is worth it - others undoubtedly\nwon\u2019t - but in the end, there is little uncertainty as to what this movie is about\nand why it ever came to be.\nStallone knows how to demonise\n\u201cthe enemy\u201d to the maximum extent\npossible and I doubt there have been\nmany foes that behave so horrendously throughout the history of\nfilm. There is no grey in the world\naround Rambo, but there is \u2013 or\nat least should be \u2013 a lot of grey\nin Rambo. Stallone does not offer much real insight into the\nman\u2019s troubled soul, although\nit\u2019s quite clear that today\u2019s protagonist is no longer the same\nversion of the frustrated, misplaced protagonist of First Blood.\nThis leaves Rambo rather barren\nfor a spiritual quest, so all that remains is an exercise in vengeance,\nwhich works on its own as far as it\ndoes not try to philosophize.\nFundamentally, in the same manner in which Rocky found a more\npoetic last stint, Rambo redefined its\nown violent lyricism into the epitome\nof what the series is all about: universal\njustice.\nThat is, if there can be such a thing as\nviolent lyricism.\nAlex Casey\nFilm Editor\nStallone attempting to silence his critics\nRambo \u2605\u2605\u2605\u272b\u272b\nDirector: Sylvester Stallone\nWriter: Art Monterastelli,\nSylvester Stallone\nCast: Sylvester Stallone,\nJulie Benz,\nMatthew Marsden\nRambo realises there\u2019s no shame in drawing a state pension\n\n"

Too often great\nplans, new clubs, events and initiatives\nare stifled by Union bureaucracy and\nindividual incompetence, and I promise to instigate a more common sense,\n\u2018can-do\u2019 attitude to Student Politics\nthan has been done in the past. There\nare no metrics I can promise you for\nthis, but my approach in Chairing the\nACC over the past two years, and being treasurer for the Rugby club has\nalways been based on common sense\nand \u2018can-do\u2019 rather than endless rhetoric and pontificating.\nElect Luke Taylor as President and I\nwill;\n\u2022 Ensure that we get value for money\nfrom NUS. Initially a cynic and supporter of the No campaign in the ref-erendum, I will fight to ensure that we\nreceive the required support and services for our money!\n\u2022 Continue my existing work with\nCollege on developing the Sporting\nopportunities available to students,\nand making this task a much larger\npart of the remit of the DPCS than it\ncurrently is.\n\u2022 Push through Phase 2 of the Union\nredevelopment, ensuring that environmental questions are answered, and\nthat the facilities are fit for purpose, i.e.\na Students Union, not an office block.\n\u2022 Ensure proper representation for\nPostgraduate students after the farce\nthat was the GSA this year.\nRemember, Vote Taylor \u201808 for a Positive Change!\nUNION\nPRESIDENT\nFELIX\nEDITOR\nGreg Mead\nI\n\u2019m Greg and I\u2019ve been working for Felix since my first year\nin 2004. I\u2019ve edited music and\nnightlife sections for the past\nthree years.\nThis year, I\u2019m proud to say I\u2019ve been\ninvolved in what I believe has been the\nmost successful and consistent Felix\nduring my time at Imperial but that\nbeing said, things can always be im-proved. My goal would be primarily\nto increase the student participation\nin the paper as at this time almost all\nthe editors are in their final year so it is\nessential to attract new blood to maintain the current quality of articles.\nCurrently I believe medical students\nfor one are under represented in Felix,\nand one of my campaign points will be\nto improve this, not only by printing\nand delivering more copies of Felix to\nthe medical campuses but by creating\na new section and editorial position for\nmedics.\nGeneral student participation can\nbe greatly improved if Felix taps more\ninto the valuable list of contacts that\nhas been built up over the years, who\nare more than willing to organise com-petitions, events and bar-nights for\nstudents throughout the term.\nAs a final point, every year the Felix\neditor candidates promise to rebuild\nthe website, I have real experience in\nthis field and can actually make this\nhappen. I will create a fully working\nsite before the end of the summer, with\nstudent access to all past issues of Felix since 1949. Visit http://votegreg.\nblogspot.com for more details on these\npoints.\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nI\n\u2019m Jovan, the current sports editor for Felix. I\u2019ve seen Felix go\nthrough several reincarnations;\nfrom Dave Edwards\u2019 sensible\nyear, to Rupert Neat\u2019s contro-versial, yet highly addictive issues, to\nAndy Sykes relaxed issues. This year I\nbelieve Tomo has managed to obtain a\ngood mixture of all three, but I believe\nthat it can still be improved. Cosmetically, very few changes will be made\nin order to maintain Felix\u2019s identity.\nHowever, in terms of content, changes\nwill be made, with Coffee Break being brought back properly along with\nall it\u2019s comedy writers and more Page\n3. Competitions and prizes will be returned to encourage student participa-tion, particularly for the Sports League,\ncrosswords and puzzles.\nhe serious side of Felix, however, will\nnot be sidelined. The news will range\nfrom the hard hitting to the light heart-ed, comments will give the opportunity for people to express their views,\nbut most importantly, I want students\nto think of Felix as the place to turn\nwhen no one listens to them about college problems.\nMy main aim however is with the\ninternet.\n\u2022 I want current issues to be online\nbefore the next issue is released.\n\u2022 I want to develop the website so\nthat reviews can be easily stored and\naccessed\n\u2022 I want to begin to digitally archive\nprevious editions, beginning with the\nvery first issue of Felix, so that people can see how students views have\nchanged.\nSo if you like what you hear, vote for\nJov.\nWhat will you get from the\nNUS to make our membership\nworthwhile?\nI can\u2019t see much gained from the NUS\nso far apart from the obvious NUS Extra cards and legal advice on Constitutional changes we\u2019ve had to make. But\nat the moment it\u2019s hard for me to say\nwhat we gain because I haven\u2019t had access to what the NUS provides.\nWhen we go to the Annual Conference we need to make sure that the\nNUS\u2019 structure is shaped to something Council feels is a worthwhile\nstructure.\nDo you feel you\u2019re truly representative in your views of the student\nbody, or do you think you\u2019re too\nclosely associated with a clique?\nI may well be closely associated with\nthe sports side of things having been\nACC Chair but I have also been involved in the welfare side of things as\nyear rep in Aeronautics.\nAt the start of my campaign I spoke\nto many different people from all backgrounds to ascertain whether I had any\nsupport whatsoever. I found that the\nbacking came from generally active\nstudents rather than just [sport clubs].\nWhat do you think of the Beit Masterplan so far?\nSo far there have been successes and\nquestions over whether it\u2019s value for\nmoney. I realise the first phase was\nmostly influenced by regulations over\ndisability access and things like that\nand so there wasn\u2019t so much of a scope\nto give benefits to all students. With the\nphase two there are much more tangible benefits to all the students such as\nthe new Student Activities Centre, the\ngym changes and new dance studio.\nCan you make dB\u2019s a credible venue and how?\ndB\u2019s is currently a very credible venue.\nA good night out isn\u2019t entirely dependant on the venue rather the quality of\nthe entertainments and crowd. People get too hung up on the fact that\nthe facilities aren\u2019t first class, yet on a\nWednesday nights 500 people have a\nfantastic time.\nWhen the opportunity does arrive\nto refurbish, we need to make sure we\nmake use of the consultation period as\nmuch as we can to nail down what we\nwant, first time around.\nLive! has described \u201can entrenched\nattitude that certain things are operational issues\u201d, which prevents\nelected officers getting things\ndone. How would you tackle this\nto push through the changes you\nwant to make?\nMy manifesto reflects my \u2018can do\u2019 attitude to politics. My major change to the\nrole would be to apply common sense\nrather than hide behind regulations.\nIt\u2019s important to have accountability but you mustn\u2019t hang someone out\nto dry if they make a genuine effort at\nsomething and it doesn\u2019t go quite as\nwell as planned.\nOn what timescale can we expect\nyour promises to be delivered?\nI think the promises are for your term.\nYou cannot go about changing the way\nthings are done overnight.\nYou may make promises that ultimately aren\u2019t achievable but as long\nas you are doing the best you can, you\nshouldn\u2019t be pulled up for not delivering on one of your manifesto points.\nWhere do you stand on the Higher\nEducation funding debate?\nIt\u2019s madness to campaign for free education now. Personally I think it\u2019s important and sensible to keep the cap.\nWhat do you think about the Union\u2019s current regulations governing the student media?\nIt\u2019s important the SSP is in place. I\u2019ve\nnot had extensive day-to-day dealings\nwith it but as I see it, it\u2019s too unclear.\nMaybe the relationship between the\nSabb team and Felix hasn\u2019t been good\nenough to allow a reasonable conversation about what can and can\u2019t be print-ed, which is as I see it, why last week\u2019s\nFelix came to fruition.\nAre you Ken or Boris?\nI\u2019m a Ken; he makes things happen.\nPolitical Hack or Corporate Sellout?\nPseudo-hack: I know the lingo but I\u2019m\nnot entrenched in the political games.\nVoting open: www.imperialcollegeunion.org/vote\n6\n\n"

    "content": "games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n35\nFriday 22 February 2008 felix\nGames\nW\nhen somebody\nthinks of ninjas,\none of two major\narchetypes pops\ninto their head.\nSometimes its the timid, stealthy ninjas that can't cleave their way into\nan action game even if they were up\nagainst a small army of potted plants.\nOther times, however, people imagine the brutish killing machines that\nare capable of using a combination of\nspeed, shurikens and crazy sword skills\nto solve any problem they may come\nacross. Ryu Hayabusa of Ninja Gaiden\nfame is one such ninja.\nNinja Gaidens style of stealth is\nshown in the first chapter of the game\nthat sees you infiltrating a rogue ninja\nfortress to look for information, and\nby infiltrating I mean strolling down\ncorridors killing any living being that\ndares draw breath near you. Fighting\nninja after ninja in the first chapter, the\nbasics of combat in the game become\nimportant to learn as well as the crucial differences in the game when compared to other 3d action games have\nto be noticed before you get killed in a\nshiny storm of katanas and shurikens.\nUnlike other action mainstays like\nDynasty Warriors or Devil May Cry,\ncombat in Ninja Gaiden doesn't focus\non long, flowing combos or snazzy aerial attacks to keep yourself safe from\nthe grunts cursing below but instead\non a complex system of evading enemy\nattacks while trying to capitalize on\nweaknesses in your opponents movements (a little tricky when there's often\n4+ enemies at your throat at any one\ntime). This strangely defensive style of\ncombat isn't one to catch an onlookers\neye immediately but the poetic nature\nof the dance of death in Ninja Gaiden\ndoes offer its own merits.\nThe evasive nature of combat is not\nentirely Ryu Hayabusas fault, but the\nfoes you meet play a large part in having to defend yourself. Gone are the\ndays when the combo was something\nreserved for player characters and\nbosses, as even the lowliest enemy is\ncapable of going toe-to-toe with our\nfavourite ninja and battering through\nhis defences with a series of block-breaking attacks in quick succession.\nThe enemies relentless assault does\nnot end with having combos of equal\nlength to you, but they continue on\nwith a plentiful supply of throws so\nthey can skip the block-breaking step\non the road to attacking you. All things\nconsidered, there is not really a lot that\nyou can do that the majority of opponents cannot. Blocking? Dodging?\nRanged attacks? Basically, the average\nopponent isn't far off being some kind\nof weird bot, with the added effect of it\nbeing 1 v many most of the time.\nAlthough combat is usually defen-sive, select weapons in the weapon list\nare capable of supporting an offensive\nplaying style, most notably the Dabilahro (large beserker sword) and the\nLunar (staff) can keep you alive even\nwhile attacking opponents thanks to\ntheir long-range sweeping attacks.\nOther weapons such as the faithful\nDragon Sword and the Vigoorian Flails\nalso promote their own schools of bat-tle, with the Dragon Sword emphasizing high movement speeds as many of\nits attacks come with their own sweeping dashes attached while the\nFlails work on a combination of relatively long\ncombos backed up\nwith some incredibly\nfast, high damage\nhits to help isolate opponents.\nThe game rarely\nforces you into\nusing a par-tic-Here cometh the reaper man\nAlex Stubley sneaks in his musings of an old classic, then flips out and kills all\nular weapon in an encounter so it gives\nyou the freedom to choose a weapon\nand master it without having to worry\nabout suddenly meeting an opponent\nthat renders your new-found skills\nineffective.\nThe game also comes complete\nwith a small, but diverse set of ranged\nweapons to help add that little bit of\nspice into the already over-seasoned\ncombats. Broadly speaking the ranged\nweapons are either arrows, which can\nonly be fired while standing still and\ncan be aimed in first person view for\nmore precise shots, and the shurikens\nwhich can be thrown at almost any\ntime. While the bow may be a powerful,\nit is rather cumbersome and so takes a\ngreat deal of moderation to use effec-tively. Shurikens on the other hand do\nvery little damage and for the most part\nare simply an extra little thing to worry\nabout in combat, but they become a\nnecessity in later combats as an simple\nway to stun an opponent in either self-defense or to prevent blocking for\nan upcoming combo.\nOther than\nthe combat, the game is fairly standard\nfare. The story is interesting enough,\nthe character designs are well done\nand the setting is pretty well thought\nout such that you never feel out of\nplace even while running down an\nurban street fighting military troopers in full ninja garb. The interfaces in\nthe game are easy to navigate and the\noverall game is highly polished and\nstreamlined. The learning curve of the\ngame is also very well plotted out, with\nplayers usually struggling to beat every\nnew enemy but always having victory\nin sight.\nBut screw minor details, this game\nlives and dies by its combat, and its\nhard to get sweeter than this. It is my\npersonal recommendation that any\nfans of the 3d platforming action genre\nat least give this game a try (PS3 owners can download a demo). Look out for\neither Ninja Gaiden Black on the Xbox\nClassic or Ninja Gaiden Sigma on the\nPS3. Classic? Revolutionary? I don't\nknow but what I do know\nis that there isn't a\nbetter game out\nthere for sheer\nninja face-smashery.\nGaiden\nGaiden signifies a side story of\nsorts, so I thought it would be\nappropriate to discuss some of\nthe more interesting (subjec-tive), yet less known aspects\nabout Devil May Cry.\nYou all know Resident Evil 4\nis one of the finest action-ad-venture games to have hit the\nGameCube and PlayStation 2.\nWhat a lot of you don\u2019t know\nis that RE4 would have been\nreleased about sevenish years\nago. Instead, development\ntook a rather different route.\nThere was always an intention\nfor a Hispanic setting since the\ndevelopment team were sent\nto Spain in order to study the\narchitecture. The basic character designs were drawn then,\nexplaining why both Leon and\nDante need fringe cuts, badly.\nHowever, the team apparently encountered a strange glitch\nthat caused enemies to be effectively juggled as you fired\nat them in quick succession.\nInstead of trying to solve the\nproblem, they ran with it.\nThe gameplay also took on a\nmore acrobatic, physical route\nas emphasis was placed on\ncombat over exploration.\nWith a late design decision\nto introduce mission-based\ngameplay over exploration, the\nDevil May Cry you all know and\nlove came into being.\nHowever, the story doesn\u2019t\nend there. In a strange twist of\nevents, the template for Devil\nMay Cry (which was RE4\u2019s\nto begin with, in all fairness)\nnow became that of the official Resident Evil 4. The symbiosis is quite interesting. From\nthe Hunter-like Blades to the\nhumungous castle to the essentially on-rails escapade at\nthe climax of the game, both\ngames are share much.\n\n"

    "content": "The Grantham Institute: the facts\nSimon Buckle is Director of Climate Policy at the Grantham Institute, the latest addition to the Walkway.\nIrini Kyriacou and Federica Dalamel de Bournet caught up with him to find out more about what it does\nT\nhe Grantham Institute for Climate\nChange was launched in February\n2007 after a \u00a312 million donation\nover ten years by the Grantham\nFoundation for the Protection of the\nEnvironment.\nWhat is the role of the Grantham Institute\n(GI)?\nThe GI\u2019s role is to develop cross-disciplinary research at Imperial on climate change, its impacts\non humans and ecosystems and what we can do\nabout it in terms of mitigation technologies and\nadaptation. The Institute also has as one of its\ncore aims to translate the results of research into\nour responses to climate change, both in terms\nof technological and policy development. So that\nwhat we actually do about climate change has a\nsound basis in the research.\nHow did the Grantham Institute come about?\nImperial College has a long tradition of research\nin climate science across the different depart-ments, but it has never really been joined up. And\none thing about climate change is that it requires\npeople working in different disciplines to come\ntogether to tackle some of the key questions.\nBefore the Grantham Institute was launched in\nearly 2007, College (led by Sir Peter Knight) was\ndeveloping its own initiative on climate. Then the\nGrantham Foundation for the Protection of the\nEnvironment came along and after some discussion offered to give \u00a312 million over a period of 10\nyears, i.e. about \u00a31 million a year, to be invested in\nclimate research. The rest is history.\nHow is this money distributed each year?\nIt will fund PhDs, post-docs, and permanent\npositions around College and a small number\nat the Institute. Last year we funded 7 PhDs: in\nPhysics (on photovoltaics and wind energy), in\nLife Sciences at Silwood (biosphere-atmosphere\ninteractions and climate impacts on biodiver-sity), Earth Science and Engineering (carbon se-questration) and Civil Engineering (flood and\ndrought risk assessment). Another set\nof PhD studentships has just been\nadvertised, as have a number of\nlecturers and postdoc posi-tions. [see http://www3.\nimperial.ac.uk/cli-matechange/courses/\nphdstudentships]\nCan you explain to\nus in more detail\nwhat kind of research the GI is\ninvolved in?\nWe are still very new\nbut we aim to develop\ncutting edge research\nacross all areas at IC.\nWe have set out four\nmain research themes:\n1) Earth Systems Science: this looks at fundamental Earth processes,\ne.g. atmospheric physics,\nocean modelling and how\nthe biosphere affects the cli-mate. For example, a new\ngeneration of ocean computational modelling is being\ndeveloped in the Department of Earth Science\nand Engineering.\n2) Vulnerable Eco-systems and Human Welfare:\nthis will focus on climate impacts on eco-systems\nand human welfare and what can be done to adapt\nto those impacts. For example, climate change\nwill change the incidence of major diseases such\nas malaria in Africa. We need to be able to understand this process so that we can then make\ninformed decisions to control the disease.\n3) Sustainable Futures: this covers both mitigation technologies to reduce carbon emissions into\nthe atmosphere (e.g. carbon capture and storage,\nphotovoltaics, renewables etc) and also policy re-sponses, e.g. how to drive the transformation to a\nlow-carbon economy? Can we get effective international action on emission reduction?\n4) Risk Extremes and Irreversible Change: A lot\nof the costs of climate change could come from\nextreme events, e.g. more severe storms. We\nneed to understand these much better. We also\nneed a better grasp of the risk of abrupt climate\nchange, e.g. the melting of the Arctic ice-cap is\ntaking place much faster than anyone predicted.\nAnd climate change also threatens extinction for\na huge number of species. Some of these impacts\nwould be irreversible.\nThere are lots of people around the College who\nare committed to doing high-quality research in\nthese areas, so that is very encouraging.\nI think what we need to do over the next few years\nis to use the Grantham Institute to build up the\nscale of resources working on climate related issues around the College. We want to make sure\nthat IC makes a real contribution to this work and\nthat the Institute makes an important contribution to the policy debate and the decisions that\nare made.\nJust how worried should we be about global\nwarming?\nThe UN framework aims to avoid dangerous\nman-made climate change, but we don\u2019t really\nknow where that danger lies. But things are already happening now in the system\nthat we can tell are due to climate\nchange rather than natural climate variability. Al\nGore might be trying\nto shock people, but\nthere\u2019s no doubt that\nthe climate CAN\nchange over quite\nshort time-scales,\ne.g. decades rather\nthan centuries. I\nwouldn\u2019t like to\nsay it\u2019s going to in\nthe next X years,\nwe just don\u2019t know\nenough. But the\nfact that there is\nthat risk means\nthat we really DO\nneed to be cautious\nabout letting greenhouse gases build up\nin the atmosphere. The\nproblem is that we don\u2019t\nknow where the dangerous\npoints are.\nEven without any abrupt\nchange to the\nsystem, the\nrising\ntemperatures and changing patterns of rainfall\ncould have huge impacts on water availability, ag-riculture, biodiversity, extreme events etc.\nDo you have a message for the student body?\nClimate change is a critical challenge for society\nand we need the expertise of the researchers and\nstudents of IC to really address it over the next\nfew years.\nWe need people to understand the urgency of the\nproblem. We have a window of 10-15 years to do\nsomething really serious about this problem, otherwise we are committed to have a level of CO2\nin the atmosphere which IS worrying in terms of\npotential impacts.\nLook out for special events hosted by the GI,\nwe\u2019ll be developing our program over the next\nyear. The Annual Lecture by our new Director,\nProfessor Sir Brian Hoskins, will probably be in\nMay. Brian is a world-class climate expert; he has\nchaired the Met Office Scientific Advisory Committee since 1995, he was elected as a Foreign Associate of the US National Academy of Sciences\nin 2002 and appointed as a Foreign Member of\nthe Chinese Academy of Sciences in the same\nyear. He was knighted in 2007 for his services to\nenvironmental science.\nMany people who acknowledge the fact that\nclimate change is happening are still not prepared to change their lifestyles to reduce carbon emissions. Why do you think that is?\nThat\u2019s partly why trying to understand the risks,\nand communicating them better, is so important.\nAnd a lot of people still don\u2019t understand what\nclimate change is.\nPeople say \u201cOh climate change, that\u2019s about the\nozone hole!\u201d They have inherently flawed notions\nof the problem. They hear things and they get\nworried about it, but they don\u2019t really understand\nit.\nSo you believe that individuals can make the\nchange happen; it\u2019s not just the government\u2019s\njob and big policy makers?\nWell you know, governments will act when people tell them that they are fed up with what is\nhappening and what\u2019s been done before. Or when\nthey are really convinced about the scale of the\nthreat they face \u2013 and there\u2019s still some work to\ndo there. Look what happened after WWII: the\nUS put together a massive program of aid, the\nMarshall Plan, because they were worried that\ncommunism would destabilise Europe. There was\na massive political and financial effort. I think you\nneed a similar scale of effort \u2013 political, scientific,\ntechnological and economic - on climate change.\nDo you think the US has got the message now?\nThere has been some movement e.g. at the G8\nmeeting in Heigendamm in 2007. But the negotiations at Bali showed how difficult it still is to\nmake progress. I think there is a fundamental\nscepticism that President Bush will commit to\nthe scale of changes which are needed. People are\nwaiting for the next president. Whether he or she\nwill be radically better or not we need to wait to\nsee, but other governments are not going to do\na bad deal with the current administration. They\nare going to wait. And in the meantime there is a\nlot of progress at the individual State level, e.g. in\nCalifornia.\nAre you optimistic about what Imperial can do\nin terms of climate change?\nIn terms of the expertise we can bring, I am very\noptimistic. We now have a chance of doing something really exciting and important across the\nwhole College. But it is not just Imperial, lots of\nother people and institutions will have a role too,\nsome of whom have been working on the area\nfor a much longer time and on a larger scale. The\nappointment of Sir Brian Hoskins immediately\nmeans that we will be able to link more closely\nwith Reading\u2019s extensive climate modelling ex-pertise. We are also developing partnerships with\nother leading institutions both in the UK and\noverseas.\nGrantham Family: Quick History\nJeremy Grantham was born in Yorkshire,\nand went to the University of Sheffield.\nHe is a well-known investment manager\nand chairman of Boston-based investment firm, GMO.\nHis wife Hannelore is German and is\nthe Director of the Grantham Foundation for the Environment.

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n19\nFriday 22 February 2008 felix\nPolitics\nDry Wit & Tonic\nend. According to the Cuban Commission for Human Rights, there are now\n20% fewer prisoners of conscience\nthan there were two years ago. Castro and others in the regime of course\nhave their enemies; there have been\nmany failed assassination attempts, the\nUnited States of America attempted an\ninvasion and there has been a harsh US\nembargo since 1962.\nThe future for Cuba is uncertain.\nThere are two main contenders for the\nPresidency: Raul Castro and de facto\nPrime Minister Carlos Lage Davila. It is\nexpected that Raul Castro will be elect-ed; he appears to have Fidel\u2019s blessing.\nOf Raul, he said \u201c[He] is younger than\nI, more energetic than I. He can count\non much more time\u201d. Even if Raul Castro does become President of Cuba for\nthe next 5 years, no one can predict\nhow he will act as leader. \u201cBehind me\nare others more radical than I\u201d, added\nFidel Castro in 1997. However, Raul\nCastro has pledged to sign the United\nNations conventions on human, political and economic rights later this\nyear, showing a less oppressive style of\ngovernance than Fidel. Raul Castro has\ninitiated debate over what changes the\nCuban people want to see. Amongst\nstudents\u2019 complaints, low wages, lack\nof ability to travel and lack of free access to internet are common. It is the\nstudent population, largely opposed to\ncontinued Communist rule that is the\nfuture of Cuba. There are indications\nthat the regime is listening and adopting policies to help the people based\nupon these debates. Even if elected it\nis not certain that Raul Castro would\naccept the Presidency as in June 2007\nhe indicated that a collective leadership would most likely govern Cuba\nafter Fidel.\nInternational reaction to Fidel Castro\u2019s resignation has been mixed. US\nPresident George W. Bush called for\nfree elections to be held saying \u201cThis\nshould be a period of democratic transition for the people of Cuba\u201d and\npledged support and help. However,\nsenior US state department official\nJohn Negroponte added that the 1962\nembargo would probably not be lifted\n\u201cany time soon\u201d. UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown says \u201cwe can only\nhope that a new path will open up...\nand there will be more democracy in\n[Cuba]\u201d. Spanish Latin America minister Trinidad Jimenez supports keeping links with the Cuban regime and\nbelieves Raul Castro \u201cshould start to\nput the reforms into action\u201d to benefit\nthe Cuban people. A spokesman for\nthe EU agrees, adding \u201cwe reiterate\nour willingness to engage with Cuba\nin constructive dialogue\u201d. UK Liberal\nDemocrat foreign affairs spokesman\nEdward Davey said \u201cit is important for\nthe international community, especially America, to hold out the hand of\nfriendship\u201d.\nIt appears at time of writing that the\ntransition of power will be peaceful\nwith the most likely candidate to succeed Fidel being Raul Castro. If this\nhappens, Cuba can hopefully look forward to economic stability and a continuation of the socialist ideals put in\nplace by his brother Fidel before him.\nWhatever the outcome of the elections\non Sunday, the international community should take the opportunity to\ncreate stronger links with Cuba which\ncan only serve to help the Cuban peo-ple, most of whom have not known\nof any other regime; over 70% of the\npopulation was born after the revolu-tion. However, Cuba must push ahead\nfurther with social reforms, including\nending the oppression of the opposi-tion. There are signs that this will happen in the future. With the departure\nof one of the most important and enduring icons of the latter half of the\n20th century comes not only the end\nof an era but the beginning of a new,\npromising time for Cuba.\nPakistan has never been a nation\nwith stable political leadership; current events represent the continuation of the struggle between Islamists,\nSecularists and the military that have\nplagued the Islamic Republic since its\ncreation in 1947. Recent elections favoured secular groups such as the party of the late Benazir Bhutto (the PPP)\nand former Prime Minister Nawaz\nSharif (the PML-N). The possibility of\nan alliance between these rival parties\nis a significant counter weight to the\npower of Pervez Musharraf. Hardline\nIslamic politicians have suffered heavy\nlosses, this makes it likely that Pakistans support in the war on terror will\ncontinue.\nThe elections have, in general, been\ncarried out smoothly. There is no indication of vote rigging or tampering. In\naddition, efforts by terrorists to disrupt\nvoting was largely unsuccessful. However, there are reports that turnout\namongst woman was low, due to fear\nof violence.\nThe victory of secular parties can, in\npart, be interpreted as a protest vote\nagainst the assassination of Benazir\nBhutto. However, many Pakistani\u2019s also\nresent the degradation of democratic\ninstitutions under the rule of Musharraf, the lawyer\u2019s protests last year is just\none example. For the UK, this result is\nfavourable in several ways. The success\nof democratic processes in Pakistan,\nsuch as elections, makes it easier for the\nUK to continue co-operating with Pakistan on issues such as terrorism. The\naccusation that the UK has supported\ndictatorship in Pakistan has been a\nsource of embarrassment both internationally and at home. The UK will be\nglad to shake off the label of hypocrisy.\nResults of Pakistan\u2019s elections\nLong after the death of Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan holds free elections that herald defeat for Musharraf\nKadhim Shubber In addition the election victory continues the separation of the military from\ngovernment that began with the retirement of Pervez Musharraf. As the military fulfils its role with the direction of\nan elected government it will be more\nconfidant in its fight against terrorism.\nWith the decreased support of Islamic\npoliticians the army will be firmer in its\nfight against the Taleban and extrem-ists; with the knowledge that it has the\nsupport of the electorate.\nWith the proviso of continued sta-bility, the outcome of the elections is\nfavourable for the UK. For Pakistan,\nhowever, there is still much uncertainty ahead. It remains to be seen whether\nMusharraf will have his wings clipped\nor be forced out altogether. There is a\nbig question mark over the leadership\nof the PPP and PML-N, will they shake\noff an image of corruption and credibly\nlead the nation?\nCastro has throughout his life cultivated the image of a revolutionary.\nAsif ali Zardari (Bhutto\u2019s widower) and former PM Nawaz Sharif\n\n"

This\nprestigious event, sponsored by the\nlikes of Toshiba and Japan Airlines, had\nbeen hosted by SOAS for the first two\nyears, and we were very honoured to\nhave held it here this year.\nThe first round involved a series of\ntelephone interviews (all in Japanese,\nobviously!) and the potential candidates had to persuade the judges that\nthey had what it took to compete in\nthe finals. The 12 finalists were from\nall over the UK, including Warwick,\nOxford and Nottingham, and three of\nImperial\u2019s finest, Faizal Farokh, Ro42 felix Friday 22 February 2008\nhan Nanda, and Handoo Seo. Their\nspeech titles were \u201cDo video games\nhave a bad influence on youth?\u201d, \u201cNonJapanese people\u2019s impression of Japan\u201d\nand \u201cLife\u2019s Magic\u201d. All were inspiring\nand fresh, and spoken in such beautiful Japanese that it was hard to believe\nthey aren\u2019t studying for degrees in it!\nThis competition was split into two\ncategories; the first category was for\nthe six students who studied Japanese\nas their main degree subject, and the\nsecond category for those studying\nit as an optional course. It involved a\n15-minute speech, which they had to\nprepare for and know inside out. This\nwas their chance for all their hard work\nto pay off. The event, which was held\nin LT1 of the Chemical Engineering\nbuilding, was absolutely packed.\nIt was great to see so many people interested in the language and culture.\nAfter much deliberation and many\ntough decisions, the judges had to\nchoose the winners, and in the second\ncategory, to our delight, Handoo was\nplaced first, and Faizal second, both\nclaiming prizes which consisted of a\nToshiba laptop, and a digital camera\n(plus 500 quid!!), respectively. So huge\ncongratulations to both of them and\nwe wish them the best of luck in their\nfuture endeavours.\nThe extremely generous prizes didn\u2019t\nend there \u2013 the winner and runner-up\nfor the first category (students from\nLeeds and SOAS) received air tickets\nto Japan and a digital camera too!\nThe end of the day was a happy one\nfor all competitors and spectators, as\nwe had a raffle, and a seemingly endless supply of sushi, tempura, and wine!\nThe success of the day was thanks to\nthe huge amount of organisation and\neffort put in by the Japanese teachers\nfrom the humanities department, as\nwell as the students who helped out\non the day \u2013 namely the level four\nstudents, and those from the Japanese\nsociety (they weren\u2019t there for the free\nsushi and booze\u2026).\nFinally, I would like to take this opportunity to advise those interested in\nlearning Japanese to contact the humanities department or send an e-mail\nto the Japanese society at japanese@\nic.ac.uk. We look forward to seeing\nmore new faces soon; sayonara!\n\u201cDo video games have a bad influence on youths?\u201d was second\nplaced Faisal Farokh\u2019s topic for the speech competition Handoo Seo, winner of the second category, giving his speech\nRelationships and religion\nImperial\u2019s Muslim and Christian societies used last week to talk love. Tosin Ajayi has all the gossip\nD\nuring Valentine\u2019s week\nthere were two intriguing events held within\n24 hours of each other.\nUnderstanding the Opposite Sex, held by the Every Nation\nChristian Society, and Islam and Romance, held by the Muslim Medics\nSociety. Topics that neither religion is\nwell known for addressing.\nUnderstanding the Opposite Sex was\na light, fun affair, with all the female\nattendees being given roses upon entrance (note, might wanna do something about the thorns next time). All\nattendees were given a card and asked\nto recount their most embarrassing\nmoment of misunderstanding, then\ntwo male and female volunteers from\nthe audience were quizzed on what the\nsexes found most difficult to understand about each other. The pick of the\nanswers had to be when one of the guys\nsaid he didn\u2019t understand why women\ntalk so much and one of the women actually agreed with him.\nThe speaker for the evening, Wolfgang Eckleben, the pastor of Every\nNation Church London, was engaging\nand raised a few laughs from the audi-ence, one audience member is known\nto have asked afterwards: \u201cWhy does\nhe keep going on about his wife?\u201d If\nyou\u2019ve got it, flaunt it I guess.\nHis case was one that the majority\npresent agreed with, even though he\ntook passages from the Bible (nota-bly Matthew 19: 4 - 6) as his starting\npoint, suggesting that the differences\nbetween men and women were deliberate and put there by God, who nevertheless expects us to \u201cjoin together as\none\u201d. He went on to describe similarities between men and women, mainly\nour needs for belonging and intimacy.\nHe then got onto what it seemed\nmany had come for: the differences.\nOne highlight was when he described a\ntheory that linked testosterone to a disconnection between the two halves of\nthe male brain, which also shrinks the\nright side of the brain. He went through\nthe way the differences affect commu-nication, crisis management and even\nsexual turn-ons. His aim seemed to be\nto give each sex an insight into the way\nthe other thought, and his conclusion\nwas to get the most out of relation-ships, be a lover (someone who seeks to\ngive to the other person) as opposed to\na luster (someone who\u2019s just after what\nhe/she can get, usually sex). The Q&A\nindicated that what he had said had\nbeen well received, with many students\nwanting more detail on how he would\nsuggest they go about implementing\nhis principles. It appeared he\u2019d painted\nan attractive picture of what a relationship should be like.\nIslam and Romance was aimed\nmainly at Muslims, the idea being to\nprovide guidance. The speakers were\nthree Muslim students, and the scope\nwas to look at relationships between\nthe bounds of a marriage. The talk took\nthe form of looking mainly at the life of\nProphet Muhammad and his relationships with two of his wives; Khadejah,\nhis first wife who was with him at the\nbeginning of his life\u2019s mission, and Aisha, his youngest wife.\nA key quote that kicked off the talk\nwas \u201cyour relationship with your wife\nreflects on your relationship with Allah\u201d and a lot of the principles mentioned were in that vein, with such\nQu\u2019ran verses as \u201cBe dutiful to your\nLord, who created you from a single\nperson and from him he created his\nwife\u201d. The picture was one of Devotion\nto Allah first and foremost, and then\nto your wife. One such story was of an\narmy general, who asked Muhammad\nwho he loved most, expecting that Muhammad would say him. Muhammad\nsurprised him by saying his wife.\nThe picture that was drawn of the\nmarriage relationship was a sweet, almost beautiful one, especially when\nMuhammad\u2019s dealings with his wives\nwere recounted. What emerged was a\nloving picture of righteousness, summarised in the conclusion that the relationship is to be \u201cbuilt on steadfast-ness, playfulness, hearts united, always\nbringing a smile, laughter & tranquillity\u201d. A side of Islam that doesn\u2019t get\nmuch airtime.\nSo, Valentine\u2019s week with the Christians and the Muslims. On this evi-dence, they should talk a lot more\nabout relationships; it appears they\nhave much worth saying.\nWatch or shampoo advert? You decide\n\n"

What was he thinking?! Part 1 of 2\nI\nhad been in Rwanda for a good\nfew days when I decided to\nmatatu myself over to the lake\ntown of Gisenyi overlooking the\ncalm waters of Lake Kivu. This\ntown was supposedly the Costa del Sol\nof Rwanda where the rich and famous\ncame to enjoy watersports in front of\nexpensive lakeside houses. When I got\nthere, it was pretty dead to be honest\nand there certainly wasn\u2019t anyone rich\nin sight!\nI was aimlessly wandering around,\nsticking out like the sorest of mzungu\nthumbs with my gigantic lopsided\ngreen rucksack, a variety of bright\nbags, and sporting a pink shirt. There\nreally was not much to do here having\nspent the whole afternoon making rudimentary chat in English with the curious residents, eventually ending up\nalone by the lake watching it become\nthe same colour as the sky.\nI had no further ideas or bookings but\ninstead I had a bit of a secret agenda.\nEver since landing more than two borders away, I had been toying with the\nidea of seeking adventure in the Democratic Republic of Congo and perhaps I\nforgot to mention this, but Gisenyi was\nalso the border town to the Congo. My\nconversation with the locals all day had\nbeen about this and that while I pretended to myself that I wasn\u2019t looking\nfor information on the situation across\nthe border and that I wasn\u2019t actually\ngoing to go there. It\u2019s akin to making\nchat with your boss while pretending\nyou are not interested in a promo-tion. Alas, I so shamelessly was. The\nmuezzin sang out the call to the dusk\nprayers, and praying for the best I ven-38 felix Friday 22 February 2008\n\u201cA few steps\naway from the\nsmooth roads\nand relative\nsafety of Gisenyi,\nthe town Goma\nwas an utter\nmoonscape\u201d\nanymore I would go to the ATM.\nOn the way back from the one of\nthe few squat toilets Shu Shu offered,\nI noticed a dark red glow crowning the\nnorth of the city. It was the brooding\nNyiragongo volcano responsible for\nGoma\u2019s current state, still alive and\nkicking. Well for that night at least I\nwent to sleep soundly.\nWaking up when the receptionist turned up for work, I saw Goma\nin daylight for the first time and was\ndumbfounded. For as far as the eye\ncould see the landscape was hilly contours of black and curly hardened lava.\nNyiragongo\u2019s impact on Goma\u2019s history was evident; it had erupted three\ntimes in recent history and as a result\nmost buildings used their second or\nthird floor as the entrance. I decided\nthen that no matter what it took, I just\nhad to go up that mysterious volcano\u2019s\nside and take a quick gander into the\nbubbling crater. I just did not know\nhow yet.\nThe guesthouse luckily did though\nand put me in touch with a local\npioneer of tourism by the name of\nKennedy, a tall, funny and hearty guy,\nlacking any formalities, whose mannerisms made me feel like he was old\nschool friend.\nHe was a firm believer in a vast untapped tourism market in Congo, setting up his own firm \u2018Hakuna Matata\nTours\u2019 to capitalise on it. He took me to\nhis house to show me the tent he and\nI would use for the 2 day return trip\nbut warned me that another curious\nThe marvellous lava landscape\nmy stuff together, paid the dingy \u2018hotel\u2019 and legged it to Kennedy\u2019s for some\nanswers.\nApparently, some rebels had decided\nto make an advance on to Goma and\nthe Congolese army was amassing here\nin huge numbers to try and quell this\nrebellion. The UN was also getting in-volved, providing the ill equipped army\nwith tanks, weapons and helicopters. I\nknew I shouldn\u2019t have felt this way but I\ngot incredibly excited seeing the machinations of the military, the aggregates\nof soldiers marching and the possibility of history unfolding in front of me.\nWell, I got up to a lot of fun stuff here\nthat got me into the thick of things,\nbut I will talk about that next week. It\nseemed the rebels were a force to reckon with as only a year ago they actually\nhad managed to take over Goma and\nthe UN had to drive them out to regain\ncontrol.\nThe subsequent day Kennedy came\nto me and told me how he felt the\nsituation was going to get a lot worse\nvery soon and that the fighting was\nprobably going to come into Goma\nonce again. He advised me to leave the\nCongo as soon as possible. Kennedy,\nas I said, was generally a bit of a comic\nbut this time he was being very serious.\nTo make matters worse I could not go\nback the way I came he said because of\nthe fighting so would need to escape\nusing a boat. It left the very next morning across Lake Kivu for the border\ncrossing at Bukavu.\nThis seemed immediately not to be\nLake Kivu changes colour at dusk\ntured towards the border on foot.\nOnce the somewhat difficult border-crossing had been bargained through\nin dollars, I felt a sense of false pride\novercome me. I was a student, used to\nthe safety of South Kensington, and\nhere I found myself in the Congo with\nlittle information and no plans. My\nexcitement became even more elated\nwhen I saw convoys of the United Nations, Medicine Sans Frontier, NATO\nand various armed military personnel\ncruise past me as I literally walked it\ninto the Congo alone on the night of\nthe 29th August 2007.\nIt is truly fascinating how much\nof a difference a man made border\ncan make. A few steps away from the\nsmooth roads and relative safety of\nGisenyi, the town Goma was an utter\nmoonscape, with layers of uneven lava\nforming the town\u2019s surface. Shielding\nmyself from clouds of dust, I started at\nthe basics first. Rooms were full everywhere because of the UN presence\nbut about an hour into my endeav-our, I chanced upon the oddly named\n\u2018Shu Shu Guesthouse \u2013 The Cheapest\nRooms in Goma\u2019. They too were full,\nbut here it was with visiting locals.\nI pleaded with them for help but at\nthis late time they couldn\u2019t really offer\nmuch. In desperation I asked them if\nthey would let me sleep on the floor of\nthe reception that we were sitting in.\nFor a price of $10, they agreed. At this\npoint I remembered that I had not really thought about money. Well I had\n$400, I thought naively, and if I needed\nperson had fallen in and died about a\nmonth ago.\nWell nothing comes without an inherent risk I thought. It was a bit ar-rogant, but you can\u2019t be so close to\nsuch excellent adventure and shun it\nbecause of someone else\u2019s bad luck.\nHowever he had to take a few MSF\ndoctors to see the Silverback Gorillas\nof the Zaire basin first and this for me\nmeant either a 2 day wait or a $290 trip\nwith them. I therefore agreed to this\ntrip also but because of my poor financial situation, agreeing to wire him the\npayment when I got back to Rwanda.\nI was surprised he was okay with this\nand spent the rest of the day walking\naround Goma, admiring the marvellous lava landscape.\nWhen we returned Kennedy told me\nthat there was now a problem. Some\nrebels had suddenly come to occupy\nthe slopes of Nyiragongo so we would\nnot be able to climb directly. So the\nnext few days I explored the surrounding regions, visiting green volcanic\nlakes, pygmy villages of men with 30\nwives and 60 children, and other local sites on motorbike. I also tried my\nbest to hobnob with some of the other\nforeigners at expensive hotels, meeting\na few doctors, one diplomat and a few\njournalists.\nThe most interesting guy by far\nthough was a New York Times photographer who had some amazing\nshots chronicling a pygmy genocide\ntaking place in central Congo that no\none outside had any idea of. He also\nhad some riveting tales from his time\ncovering the Rwandan genocide and\nhe went on to describe some horrific\nstories from places I had just visited to\nmy disbelief.\nAnyway, one morning I was back at\nGoma, still waiting for the go ahead\nfrom Kennedy when I woke up to the\nsound of helicopters flying overhead\nand heavy machinery. I had a breakfast\nof UHT milk and white bread before\ngetting dressed to take a peek at the\nhullabaloo outside.\nNow, I get excited by the smallest of\nthings as I am sure you have noticed,\nbut the shock of seeing the entire city\nsuddenly swarming with the presidential guard and the army when the day\nbefore it had been as dead as a goat was\nquite something! A transformation had\ntaken place that day and things were\ngoing down but I was clueless. I got\n\u201cbut warned\nme that another\ncurious person\nhad fallen in and\ndied about a\nmonth ago.\nWell nothing\ncomes without\nan inherent risk I\nthought.\u201d\nBuildings submerged in ash and lava on the streets of Goma\n\n"

I have\nexperience and proven ability at every\nlevel of the Union from club officer\nto Union committees to Council and\nthen as Deputy President (Finance and\nServices) last year.\nWith the College facing great chang-es, the Union needs to move forward\ntoo. We need officers prepared to listen to students and fight for their in-terests, not pursue individual agenda.\nI believe there are important things to\nbe done this year, including:\n\u2022 An open review of our NUS membership culminating in a free and open\nreferendum.\n\u2022 Negotiating a fair space agreement\nwith College including more poster\nspace for student activity.\n\u2022 Getting discounts from local shops\nand businesses with only an IC card.\n\u2022 Improve our training and service to\nall clubs and societies including cheaper prices for club bar nights.\n\u2022 Working for funding for all FUs\nto have a full time president over the\nsummer.\n\u2022 Making the Union more open and\naccessible with clearer communica-tion; to serve our members, we must\nfirst listen to them.\n\u2022 Aiming for Cask Marque Accreditation within the year.\nYou cannot elect a President on these\nfew short words but my full manifesto\nis available at http://votejonmatthews.\nblogspot.com.\nVote Jon Matthews for the change we\nneed and you deserve.\nA\ns RCSU President this\nyear and Welfare Officer\nlast year, I\u2019ve got a strong\nrecord of delivering for\nstudents and a wealth of\nexperience. In all my roles in the Union\nI\u2019ve focused on deliverable outcomes\nrather than bureaucratic processes,\nand if you elect me as President I\u2019ll\ncontinue to do so. This is what I want\nto achieve for you:\n\u2022 Make the Union a place where you\nwant to drink, eat and dance.

If they do, she\u2019ll want to see\nwhether they\u2019re just reforms on a piece\nof paper or whether they\u2019re actual institutional reforms. Then she\u2019ll be able\nto assess if it\u2019s worth \u00a344k. If they don\u2019t,\nI get the impression she\u2019d be looking at\neither a review or a referendum. She\u2019s\ncertainly a sceptic.\nDo you feel you\u2019re truly representative in your views of the student\nbody, or do you think you\u2019re too\nclosely associated with a clique?\nA lot of Jen\u2019s Union experience comes\nthrough the RCSU, but she\u2019s also been\ninvolved in ICRadio and bowling. Plus\nshe\u2019s still very much involved in and the\nBiology and BioChemistry DepSocs.\nI think she would say that, yes, she\u2019s\nbeen associated through the RCSU but\nshe\u2019s proved by being a Faculty Union\nPresident that she has a very wide experience of the whole Union.\nWhat do you think of the Beit Masterplan so far?\nSorry, I haven\u2019t really spoken to Jen\nenough on that one.\nCan you make dB\u2019s a credible venue and how?\nIt\u2019s twofold: it\u2019s about the redevelopment and making sure students have\nthey\u2019re say on what we get out of this\nrefurbishment. It\u2019s not simply good\nenough to look at the physical tfabric\nof the building but also the entertainment offerings.\nLive! has described \u201can entrenched\nattitude that certain things are operational issues\u201d, which prevents\nelected officers getting things\ndone. How would you tackle this\nto push through the changes you\nwant to make?\nThe thing she would rate most importantly is your management style and\nhow consensual you are and often I get\nthe impression [the term] \u201coperational\u201d is used as a way of defending areas\nwithin the Union. I think Jen would say\nit\u2019s about the way you approach people;\nif you\u2019re aggressive people are going to\nbe defensive and they\u2019re going to put\nup obstacles.\nOn what timescale can we expect\nyour promises to be delivered?\nSome of [her manifesto points] are\nclearly going to be works in progress\nsuch as the Union redevelopment, but\nsome things she\u2019ll definitely want delivered in her term are: a sexual health\ntesting clinic on campus; reforms of\nthe Union room booking system; a\nresolution on security problems in\nhalls; and to make sure students\u2019 views\nare heard on a the national stage in the\n2009 [Top-up Fees] review.\nWhere do you stand on the Higher\nEducation funding debate?\nIt\u2019s all about keeping the cap and I think\nshe\u2019d be in favour of variable funding\nfor different institutions so research\nintensive places like Imperial get more\nmoney.\nDoes she believe in free education\nor just keeping the cap as it is?\nI think she\u2019d say free education is a nice\nideal but she\u2019s realistic about the prospects of that and how you achieve it.\nWhat do you think about the Union\u2019s current regulations governing the student media?\nI think she would want to look again\nat the regulations again and what I do\nknow is that she is a principle supporter of a free press. During my time\nas Broadsheet Editor she\u2019s allowed me\nto print whatever I wanted and I don\u2019t\nthink the student media is going to get\nmuch interference from Jen. It\u2019s not\nreally what she\u2019s interested in. I think\nyou\u2019d certainly get a very sympathetic\near from Jen.\nAre you Ken or Boris?\nShe\u2019s Ken, no doubt about it\nPolitical Hack or Corporate Sellout?\nI think um... I don\u2019t think I can answer\nthat one.\nWhat will you get from the\nNUS to make our membership\nworthwhile?\nI personally have reservations with regards to membership with the NUS.\nWe\u2019re paying an astronomical amount\nof money. One of my big manifesto\npledges is an open and clear review \u2013 as\nsoon as my term starts \u2013 of what we\u2019re\ngetting from the NUS and then to ask\nthe question: is this worth it? Ultimately, this would lead to a referendum.\nDo you feel you\u2019re truly representative in your views of the student\nbody, or do you think you\u2019re too\nclosely associated with a clique?\nI\u2019m not associated with any clique. I\nlive in halls; that gives me a very broad\nspectra. I\u2019m a member of ACC/RCC/\nSCC/RSM clubs and a Guilds one too.\nPast associations shouldn\u2019t matter.\nYou listen twice as much as you speak\nand provided you do that, that\u2019s how\nyou represent people.\nWhat do you think of the Beit Masterplan so far?\nIt\u2019s been fraught with difficulties right\nfrom its inception. The first stage ran\nway behind. People are saying the second phase will be delivered on time but\nCollege can\u2019t deliver their projects on\ntime. Pretty much no one can in the\nUK because you cannot \u2013 by law \u2013\ncharge penalties.\nThe Masterplan has got to be flex-ible. We can\u2019t operate a plan set four\nyears ago and follow it religiously.\nCan you make dB\u2019s a credible venue and how?\ndB\u2019s is a difficult situation. The space is\nbadly organised. We cant change it in\nPhase Two because the funding won\u2019t\npay to renovate a commercial venue.\nWhen dB\u2019s is packed, it\u2019s not a bad\nvenue. It looks horrible, but we turn\nthe lights out and it looks slightly less\nhorrible. To make it a good venue, it\u2019s\na long term project and we don\u2019t have\nthe time or the money.\nLive! has described \u201can entrenched\nattitude that certain things are operational issues\u201d, which prevents\nelected officers getting things\ndone. How would you tackle this\nto push through the changes you\nwant to make?\nThe two words I most hated to hear\nwhen I was a Sabb last year were: \u201cthat\u2019s\noperational.\u201d The first thing I\u2019d do is\nban those words from being uttered.\nLast year I didn\u2019t always follow the\ncorrect chain of command because [I\nhad to communicate with a long list of\npeople]. Instead I just sent an email to\nthe person that needed to do it.\nThe rules are needed for problems of\nconduct, but for minor changes they\nneed a less rigid interpretation.\nOn what timescale can we expect\nyour promises to be delivered?\nThere are a lot of promises in my man-ifesto. Some are quite quick, others\nmight take longer than a year. Change\ntakes time. There are points in there\nthat I want to start the change I\u2019m not\ngoing to be able to complete; but I\u2019m\ngoing to start everything. And that\u2019s the\nkey: some things in there are changes\nin culture and those take time.\nWhere do you stand on the Higher\nEducation funding debate?\nI think my view on the debate itself can\nbe divorced from my personal views.\nMy personal view is that there should\nbe fewer university places funded to a\nhigher level. The government should\nnot be wasting money on pointless\ncourses such as golf-course studies.\nI think the government made a pig\u2019s\near of the way they introduced the Topup Fees cap and now they can\u2019t change\nit. As soon as they do, every university\nis just going to go up to the next level.\nWhat do you think about the Union\u2019s current regulations governing the student media?\nI\u2019ve had some concerns about them.\nWe need to look at how Felix is funded.\nUltimately as DPFS last year, if I hadn\u2019t\nsigned a cheque, Felix wouldn\u2019t have\nbeen printed. That\u2019s unacceptable.\nAre you Ken or Boris?\nVery definitely not Ken! I like Boris.\nPolitical Hack or Corporate Sellout?\nI can\u2019t say I\u2019m not a hack; that wouldn\u2019t\ngo down particularly well!\n\n"

And\nfun. Mostly fun.\nThe basic premise is to\ntraverse levels of increasing\ndegrees of difficulty all the\nwhile mauling your enemies in\nvarious ways. It may be somewhat brainless but there\u2019s this\nsickeningly visceral thrill of jabbing a spear into someone\u2019s\nface at point blank range.\nThe challenges get tougher,\nrelying on you to find a balance between blocking and at-tacking. Despite being a simple\nFlash game, there appears to\nbe a few shades of depth to the\ncombat as you are able to pick\nup spears and choose between\nhurling them like javelins or using them to skewer objects.\nWithout a spear you always\nhave access to a short sword\nand the trusty soles of your\nboots for those \u201cThis is Sparta!\u201d moments that this game\nundoubtedly tries to recreate.\nThe bosses are fun and the\ngameplay in general has you\npushing constantly forward.\nAzfarul Islam\nUnreal Flash\nhttp://www.onemorelevel.\ncom/game/unreal_flash\nRight, so I\u2019m hardly the greatest UT fan out there, but there\u2019s\nno denying that this 2D can be\nsurprisingly addicting.\nEmploying the same airy\nphysics and destructive weaponry of its full-time brethren,\nthe Flash iteration of the game\ndoes its forebears proud. The\ngame is still relatively crazy, if\nnot as fast paced.\nThe controls are even the\nsame (in a certain way): aim\nwith the mouse, use WASD to\nmove (and jump) and use the\nnumber keys to select weap-ons. The game presents plenty\nof options for your preferred\nplay types so expect to get further distracted in lectures.\nAzfarul Islam\nT\nhe next generation is\ngrowing up to be wusses\n\u2013 physically and mentally.\nFrom birth, children are\nplaced in padded cribs\nand live their whole life above the safety net of a Health & Safety obsessed\nsociety. In an age when everyone's life\nexpectancy is higher than ever, we're\nall sicker than before \u2013 with allergies,\ndiabetes, obesity and a slew of mental\nillnesses being the norm rather than\nthe exception. And with political correctness the buzzword of the day, even\nour opinions are placed in a safe little\nspace where no opinion is mocked; no\nmatter how absurd. In short, life lacks\na fail state. While some of you may believe that this type of opinion shouldn't\nbe found in the Games section, you're\nwrong. For lo and behold, the point:\ngames are too damned easy.\nRemember playing a Japanese shoot-'em-up at the arcade, and dying on\nthe first level every single time? Remember playing Doom on Nightmare\nand trying to kill an imp with your\nfists? Remember dying in EverQuest\nand having to do a corpse run while\nstripped of all your gear? Hell, remember playing Mario and trying to make\nthat one jump over a flaming pit of lava\nthat required perfect timing? Odds are\nhigh that you don't. These days if your\nhealth doesn't regenerate automagical-ly, you'll resurrect mere seconds from\nwhere you died with no penalty at all.\nAnd slowly, skill is no longer required\nas the formerly inevitable fail state of a\nbrutal death is removed.\nPersonally, I blame Halo \u2013 its regenerating health and shield was the first\nstep towards games becoming easy.\nSince then, we've all grown accustomed to being treated as incompetent,\nand there's a string of games to prove\nit. StarCraft set the bar for difficulty\nin strategy games, with multiplayer\ngames that could last under 5 minutes\nif you weren't prepared \u2013 now we have\nSupreme Commander, where games\nonly end when a player manages to\nbuild nukes at Tech Level 172, 3 hours\ninto the game. EverQuest's corpse runs\nagainst World of Warcraft's ghostly\ncorpse stroll; Doom's cyberdemons\nagainst BioShock's Big Daddies (with\na resurrection chamber 10 ft away, of\ncourse); and the titular villain from\nDiablo II against Oblivion's... er... really\ncamp 60's guy?\nGimmicky games like Guitar Hero\nor anything made for the Wii just go\nfurther to prove that, collectively,\nwe are starting to suck at games; and\nworse yet, we're quite happy about it.\nWii Sports can be played undefeat-ably by waving your hands back and\nforth like a hyperactive toddler \u2013 try\ndoing that in a game of Quake 3 and\nthen come back and tell me I'm wrong.\nGames used to be about the challenge\n\u2013 about pushing yourself to beat one\nmore level, get one more item and be\nthe best you can be. The games that\nare described as difficult today \u2013 Ninja\nGaiden, N, Ikaruga \u2013 used to be par for\nthe course. Whatever happened to the\nFlamebait: Gaming wusses\nSebastian Nordgren thinks y\u2019all should toughen up and play like men, ya pansies\nthrill of failure?\nAnd despite all this, despite being\ntreated like we're not up for a chal-lenge, more people call themselves\ngamers than ever before. This wouldn't\nbother me if it weren't for the fact that\nI do remember beating Super Mario in\none sitting; killing that cyberdemon in\nDoom that had killed me a dozen times\nbefore; and getting past that last guard\nin Thief.\nAnd you know what? It felt damned\ngood \u2013 better than any feeling I've got\nfrom any singleplayer game in many,\nmany years. All that frustration and\npent-up rage from failing over and\nover again made the pay-off all the\nsweeter. So I ask you: is there no place\nfor a challenge anymore?\nIn NG you shred to survive while the same thing in GH doesn\u2019t work because it only has five frickin\u2019 buttons\nHey, the fight ain\u2019t over yet\nE\nver since the 'end' of the\nHalo story signaled by Halo\n3, speculation has been high\nas to whether another game\nwould be made. In Halo\nWars, we seem to have our answer,\nthough this time it leaves the tried\nand tested FPS genre, moving instead\nto become a real time strategy game.\nIronically though, whilst the original\ngames were made for both console\nand PC, it seems that this incarnation\nwill be solely for the 360, with the control system being \"one of the things\nEnsemble spent the most amount of\ntime on\". (Apparently the only controls\nrequired are the analog stick and the\nface buttons.) Any rumors that a PC\nversion may have been appearing were\nfurther trounced by a statement from\nMicrosoft to IGN earlier this month\nsaying \"Halo Wars is being developed from the bottom up for the Xbox\n360 and its control scheme to ensure\nthat we deliver a groundbreaking console RTS experience. Given that, we\nhave no plans to develop 'Halo Wars'\nfor Windows Vista at this time.\" ...\nperhaps they decided that in a PC vs\n360 multi-player match, the PC gamer\nmay have a rather substantial advan-tage, but given the nature of the RTS\ngenre, it still seems a rather strange\ndecision...\nAnyway, back to the game itself. In\nHalo Wars, the player takes control\nof the UNSC (United Nations Space\nCommand) forces in their first encounter with the Covenant after the loss of\nthe first planet, Harvest to the aforementioned alien bad guys. Whilst no\nclear details have yet emerged (the\ngame's release date being touted as\nJune 27th by Amazon and Play.com)\nI would assume that the game would\nfollow a similar formula to the successful Command and Conquer fran-chise, giving the player a solid single\nplayer campaign with UNSC taking\nthe role of GDI, the Covenant as Nod,\nand perhaps even a possible role of\nthe Flood as Scrin. However, since the\ngame is supposed to tak place before\nthe events of Halo: Combat Evolved,\nthe UNSC wouldn't actually know\nabout the Flood, which would throw\nthat theory out of whack, yet there is\nnothing to say that the Covenant had\nnot already encountered the Flood \u2013\nand they would make an rather interesting addition to a multiplayer side\nof the game. In terms of units, the\nold favourites such as Warthogs, Banshees and Scorpions will all be present\nalong with a few new additions such\nas the Hawk Helicopter and Wolverine Rocket Tank. Having watched the\ndemos and trailers, I would surmise\nthat standard defense structures would\nalso be available, along with a plethora\nof air craft and infantry types ranging from the standard UNSC troops\nto the commando style Master Chief in\nfull Mjolnir armour \u2013 though whether\nhe would be able to take out an entire\narmada as per normal is subject to de-bate. All in all, it looks to be shaping\nup as a rather fantastic game and another reason perhaps to purchase a 360\nover a PS3, but this is, after all, only a\npreview and I'm sure once we get hold\nof a copy we'll be able to bring you a\nfull on review detailing the ins and\nouts of this sexy looking game.\nAndrew \u201cLyle\u201d Lyle agrees that the best things come in small packages\n\n"

    "content": "Rhythm, brains and then hysteria\nEmma Thompson celebrates Dance Company winning a haul of cups at the Edinburgh dance-off\nH\neading up to Edinburgh\nto the annual Dance-Off\nhosted by Edinburgh\nUniversity, Dance Company were understandably optimistic, having won the Contemporary category twice in a row\nas well as the Jazz category last year.\nHowever, no-one could have predicted\nthe absolute obliteration of the competition from around the country that\ntook place to see them winning a total\nof 5 cups, placing in all categories en-tered, proving that Imperial has talent\nas well as brains.\nOur sexy Tappers picked up a well\ndeserved 1st place, with a dance choreographed by Francesca Garrard that\nthe judges described as \u201cvery polished\n[with a] great sense of style\u201d. Next up,\nin the Contemporary category, competition was fierce, and our pyjama-clad dancers just missed out with their\npiece by Alvaro Feito Boirac, despite\ntheir \u201cexcellent performance quality\u201d,\nto a deserving Edinburgh and Sunderland to gain a joint third place with\nBangor.\nOur beautiful Ballerinas picked up\nanother 1st, with a dance choreographed by Claire Stanley and Elisa\nBellomo with what the judges called\n\u201cexcellent choreography [with a] lovely\nartistic quality\u201d. To complete the hat\ntrick, our neon wearing \u201chigh energy\u201d\njazz dancers star-jumped their way\nthrough Hildur Einarsd\u00f3ttir\u2019s choreography to Dance Company\u2019s second\nwin in a row in this category. As an\nadded bonus, the cherry on a very big\ncake, dancers Elisa Bellomo and Pernelle Nunez won the Best Dancer and\nJudges\u2019 Awards respectively for their\nperformances in the Ballet, Jazz and\nContemporary pieces; high praise indeed for a competition involving 100\u2019s\nof individual dancers. This brought\ncelebrations to near hysteria level,\nand excitement did not dim until well\ninto the next morning after a night of\ncocktails and dancing. The only cloud\non our huge silver lining is the thought\nof how we can possibly better our performance next year!\nYou can watch Dance Company\nperform some of their winning pieces\nat International Night on the 7th of\nMarch, or come along to the JCR on\nSundays and join in.\nLog on to our website at http://\nwww.union.ic.ac.uk/rcc/dance-company/ for further details on\nhow to get involved\nDance Company celebrate winning a total of 5 cups\nThe Ballerinas elegantly pretending to be a forest\ndB\u2019s to the Great Hall: the growth of Afrogala\nTosin Ajayi gives a review of the Afro-Caribbean society\u2019s 9th Afrogala held a fortnight ago\nT\nhere aren\u2019t many times\nyou get to say the words\n\u2018There\u2019s nowhere else I\u2019d\nrather be right now\u201d and\nmean it. At 7.50pm, 9th\nFebruary 2008, 5 minutes into Afrogala presents PULSE, was one of them\n(started 15-minutes late, but that\u2019s\ngood compared to the track record).\nAs the pyrotechnics went off, the sellout crowd in the Great Hall was left in\nno doubt that this year, the show was\ngoing to be on another level.\nAs the MC opened up, recounting\nhow he\u2019d received a facebook message\nall the way back in November inviting\npeople to audition for the show, those\nwho\u2019d gotten used to an amateur performance where the sound cuts out\nhalfway through most acts realised\nhow much hard work and preparation\nhad gone into it this time.\nAnd the uncharacteristic (for Africans) preparation process paid off in a\nbig way, as a rap performance followed\nby a fashion show, musical number and\ncomedy sketch wowed the audience.\nAlthough there was not a single act\nthat could be described as being bad,\nthe less said about the Nzinga Dancers\nthe better. One performance that really stood out was given by EQHO, a\ndance crew from Warwick University,\nwho put on a great show at the packed\nafter-party.\nThereweretwocomedysketches,one\nan African twist on Cinderella titled\n\u2018Fatimarella\u2019, which had the boisterous\naudience rolling about in the aisles,\nand the second was a comedic take on\na Nigerian Folktale called Oluronbi,\ndone in the style of a childrens\u2019 storyteller narrating the story, a popular\nAfrican norm. Virtue and Vice, a Fashion show built around the seven deadly\nsins, presented some very unique and\ncreative outfits modelled by a selection\nof great-looking students.\nAn African dance, a staple of Afrogala, made inventive and energetic use\nof the Great Hall aisles to begin with\nand ended up with around 20 female\ndancers on stage dancing to a medley\nthat went from the Coming to America The events ranged from a fashion show to rap performances, a musical and a number of comedy sketches\nsoundtrack through to Yahooze, a current West African hit song.\nAs with any great show, full credit\ncannot just be given to the perform-ers, the audience played a big role in\nmaking it as successful as it was, and\nthis was one of the best audiences anyone could hope for. Made up mainly\nof Africans (majority Nigerian), with a\nsmattering of bemused-looking Caucasians, every single movement on stage\nwas encouraged and all performers\nseemed to have some family or friends\nin the crowd who would yell out when\nthey showed up, despite it being highly\nembarrassing.\nThis reporter thinks the great crowd\nwas the result of a strategic masterstroke by Events co-ordinator Damilola\nSoyode & Society President Damilola\nJaiyeola by deciding to feed the audience about an hour before the show\nstarted. With the Jollof rice, plantain &\nChicken flowing round their systems,\nthey were happy; and a well-fed African is a generous one.\nIf there was one problem with the\nevent, it would be that for an event\nhosted by the Afro-Caribbean society,\nthere was very little Caribbean about it,\neither on stage or in the audience. The\nonly representation seemed to be Miss\nJamaica UK (an Imperial medic no less)\nshowing up about halfway through to\npresent some awards to those who\u2019d\nmade a significant contribution to the\nACS. But that\u2019s nit-picking a wonderful show.\nSo the 9th Afrogala, the annual cultural showcase of the Afro-Caribbean\nSociety which had its humble beginnings in dB\u2019s; had started as a way of\ncreating funds for the then fledging\nAfro-Caribbean Society; had one act,\na hired Caribbean steel drum band,\nwhich was supplemented by an open\nmic session; and now has about twenty\nacts, mostly Imperial students, came to\nan end.\nIt was all summed up by a veteran of\nmany Afrogalas, \u201cWe used to be ama-teur, this is something else.\u201d I can\u2019t wait\nto see what they cook up for their 10th\nAnniversary.\n43\nFriday 22 February 2008 felix\n\n"

Just in case anyone is won-dering, VHS won the previous format\nwar, which is probably a good thing as\nBetamax tapes were limited to only 60\nminutes playback! Imagine a childhood\nwithout movies...\nAnyway, on first appearances, Betamax and Blu-Ray were rather similar\n- both had more complex and costly\nhardware, both had supposedly better\naudio and video quality and both times\nSony refused to release the format to\nthe porn industry! This time how-ever, Sony have increased the capacity\nof their format to many times that of\nHD-DVD and made the technology\nmore widespread, allowing many more\ndevelopers to build hardware to run\nBlu-Ray discs and crucially, they also\nput the drive into their latest games\nconsole the PlayStation 3. This move,\nwhilst being extremely risky seems to\nhave paid off for them, as it helped\nto put Blu-Ray drives in more homes\nthan the competitor. After all, people are much more likely to purchase\na \u00a3300 games console which happens\nto have a built in high-def drive than a\nsimilarly priced stand-alone player - I\nknow I would.\nLooking at HD-DVD and VHS, the\nmarketing and widespread availability that eventually helped to win the\nlast war for the latter seemed to be\nsomewhat lacking in the former, with\na few companies releasing drives in\ntheir PC\u2019s, a number of manufacturers building standalone boxes and of\ncourse not forgetting Microsoft\u2019s halfhearted HD-DVD drive add-on for its\nXbox 360.\nSo now, after almost two years it\nwould seem that the next generation\nvideo format has finally been decided.\nFollowing Warner Bros. choice of the\nBlu-Ray format earlier this year, other\ncompanies have slowly been drifting\ntowards the same side with the final\nnail in the coffin for HD-DVD being\nthe news from Wal-Mart, Best Buy\nand Netflix that they would no longer\nbe stocking the format. As a result,\nToshiba announced earlier this week\nthat they would \u201cno longer develop,\nmanufacture and market HD DVD\nplayers and recorders\u201d.\nNow I must say that I actually feel\nrather sorry for Toshiba - in the first\nround they backed Betamax and lost;\nin the second they seemingly tried to\nwalk the path of VHS by attempting to\nflood the market with their cheap(er),\nporn-friendly format... which also\nlost. However, on the bright side upon\nannouncing that it was abandoning\nHD-DVD, Toshiba\u2019s stock rose con-siderably; consumers now also have\na clear choice about which format to\npurchase, but unfortunately with Sony\nat the wheel, I am still left with the\ndilemma of where to get my high-def\nporn from? Well, if certain companies\nhave their way, in the future, all our\naudio-visual needs will be sated by\ndownloads and legal ones at that - not\nthat I would ever endorse the illegal\nacquisition of files, or porn for that\nmatter, as I\u2019m sure one could find far\nmore exhilarating ways to achieve the\nsame result... but I digress. For now,\nwith trials of \u201csuper-fast\u201d broadband\njust beginning, I think it is safe to say\nthat your investment in Blu-Ray will be\na safe one and the only \u2018proper\u2019 way to\nget high definition content onto your\nbrand spanking, shiny new HD telly.\nMartin Logan Clarity\nThousands will have to succumb to the charms of the Blu-ray Disc\n(usually Mylar \u2013 the same material in\nyour earphones) sandwiched between\ntwo grid electrodes (known as stators),\nwith an electric field of usually about\n5kV and a low current going through\nthe diaphragm for modulation. The\nmost common ESLs these days are\nusually around 1.5m tall and 0.3m\nwide, with their deepness depending\non their attached subwoofer, if any.\nThe stretched diaphragm already\nsolves the weight problem with its\n2-20\u00b5m thickness. Also, unlike the\ncoil drivers it has very delicate movement that you can hardly notice by eye.\nThese two properties allow the production of a very refined sound with\nvery little distortion, waltzed by a natural and comfortable bass. Specifically,\nmost should notice the bass part of the\npiano, drum and guitar lasting a little\nbit longer, rather than suddenly stopping when coming out from normal\nspeakers, as if you are punched by it.\nAlso,sincethediaphragmisstretched\nover a large flat surface area, the sound\nwaves produced have very little diffrac-tion: imagine you are standing about 5\nmetres away from an ESL, listening to\nsome guitar performance in a room,\nand now go right up to it with your ear\ntouching the ESL (don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t\nhurt), where you should hear almost\nthe same volume and quality as you did\n5 metres away. This is definitely something that you don\u2019t get from ordinary\nspeakers.\nAnother great feature is the lack of\na speaker cabinet \u2013 the average ESL is\njust a 2-inch thick open panel, which\ngives us a double-sided (or dipole)\nsounding, meaning greater transpar-ency, as well as no additional flavour.\nAll this adds up to high fidelity, as if\nthe live band is in the room, and you\ncan really feel the instruments being\nblown or plucked right in front of you.\nTo go with the music, the ESL\u2019s slimness is also a bonus eye candy if done\nproperly.\nNow you may ask: so if ESLs are so\ngreat, how come it is not in the mainstream market? The popular answer\nwould be because of the cost: a typi-cal, mid-range ESL system would be\naround $3000 these days, mainly due\nto manufacturing difficulty, where the\ndiaphragm-stretching process and assembly still have to be done by hand.\nMost notably though is their large size\nby nature, as the ESL panels require a\ncertain amount of surface area in order\nto produce sound efficiently. This is\nparticularly important for bass, where\nmost ESLs fall short at, and therefore\nthey are often coupled with a subwoofer at the bottom, forming a hybrid ESL\nsystem.\nThe second problem \u2013 and usually\nthe most commonly forgotten one \u2013\nis that the ESLs must be placed away\nfrom the back wall \u2013 usually about 1\nmetre \u2013 to avoid severe interference\ncaused by the reflection from the wall\n(remember, the ESL produces sound\non both sides!). More space is taken\nup by the powerful amplifiers (at least\n200W) in order to drive the ESLs, and\nof course these cost money too, especially if they are vacuum tube amplifi-ers, which are known to give a richer\nsound compared to digital ones. Leaving these behind, we finally have the\nreliability problem: ESLs are still considered as unreliable due to the high\npossibility of shorting when the air is\nhumid, although there are several ways\nof preventing such event from happening such as implementation of coating\non the membrane and stators.\nTo sum up, ESLs really are superior,\nwith hardly any problems that most traditional loudspeakers have, provided\nthat you have plenty of room, money\nand a fairly dry environment. If you are\nlooking for a system that can bring a\nlive concert into your room, where you\ncan both hear and feel the instruments\nbeing played, this 53-year-old technology is the way forward. Remember:\nhearing is believing, so do check out\nthe ESLs when you have the chance!\nMartin Logan Summit\n\n"

Regular body-con\nlooks seem pedestrian in comparison.\nMore or less everyone wanted a seat\nat Jaeger\u2019s first show in its 125-year\nhistory. To be truthful, expectations\nwere not exactly high for the show.\nDespite its upper-high street standing\nin the British commercial fashion hi-erarchy, it suffers from a lack of mass\nmarket appeal that Topshop and H&M\nenjoy, while also being relatively devoid of the elite cach\u00e9 of its designer-label competitors.\nThese preconceptions were suspended when model Suvi Koponen opened\nthe proceedings in an animated black\nand brown goat-hair cape worn over a\nmore predictable gold-buttoned black\nskirt/jacket combo.

Marios Schwab is one such de-signer. His collection early in the week\nfelt more like a study and a showcase\nof ideas rather than a typical fashion\nshow, and developed on the concept of\na tight, stretched dress pulled down to\nthe ankles. The \u201csilhouette of the season\u201d has already been explored several\ntimes by the London pack, but never\nwith the same mastery as Schwab. He\ned excitement. It was obvious in each\nof the piece\u2019s details that Moralioglu\nhad thrown himself into the collection.\nA series of graphic floral architectural\ndresses each looked totally different to\nthe ones preceding it, and were unique\nin their conception and detail.\nEvery so often there comes a collection that deserves a massive double take. And every so often there is a\ndesigner so devoted to his art and the\nprocess of creation that you begin to\nskirt paired with a casual blue vest.\nWorking with a spare palette of cornflower blue, grey and stark white, Lynn\nproduced perhaps the most effortlessly\ndebonair collection of the week.\nErdem Moralioglu\u2019s show displayed\na wealth of promise. Daring, progressive looks and increasingly ambitious\ntechniques were interspersed with\ntrenches and other wardrobe staples.\nEven these basics were beyond the\nnorm\u2014couture-like flower details add-tion to keep the East London pack and\ncoolhunters happy this season.

Whilst amusing at first,\nI was soon thinking to myself, not for\nthe last time that night, when is it going to end?\nThe first designer on the catwalk,\nScott Ramsay-Kyle, showed a mostly\nuninspiring collection. The exception\nbeing the interesting plays with volume on a series of skirts constructed\nin a graduated bubble style. Dress after\ndress walked up the catwalk looking\nlike American Apparel t-shirt dresses\nwith multicoloured streams of vomit\nstuck on, resembling my primary\nschool collages in clothing form.\nEmma Bell, the following designer on\nthe catwalk, showed a supercute confectionery themed collection. With the\ncolours sugary & artificial, junk-food\npatterning, and shiny fabrics remins-cent of candy wrapping. The sugary\ntheme enveloped the entire catwalk.\nThere were twee hair pieces; skewered mini hamburgers, drink umbrel-las, oversized bows, sitting atop teased\nout, candyfloss spun hair. The models\u2019\nfaces were embellished with make-up\nof artificial brights; glitter painted eye-lids, green & blue lipstick.\nWhen Dharma Taylor\u2019s collection\ncame down the catwalk you could feel\nshame emanating from the models.\nThat\u2019s really what you want a collection\nto do, make the models question the\nvalidity of their careers. \u201cWhy do I do\nthis? Am I really walking up and down\na catwalk wearing a leather pig\u2019s head\nand a pair of sweatpants with a penis\ndrawn on? I\u2019m in a grassy meadow, I\u2019m\nin a grassy meadow.\u201d I blame nu-rave\nfor this aberration of a show.\nAfter the bass-thumping of Dharma\nTaylor, the delicate, ethereal atmosphere of Thomas Sels was refreshing.\nUnfortunately, the atmosphere of the\nshow wasn\u2019t so much led by the cloth-ing, as the only thing stopping the\nclothing looking like dross. The most\ninteresting thing about it was the way\nthe models walked the catwalk as if in a\nslow-motion relay race. The first model\nslowly drifted out, stopped after a few\npaces, and waited for the touch of the\nmodel behind before floating forwards\na few steps further.\nNext \u201cartist\u201d Niyi rapped, I kid you\nnot, a song about eggs.

Many commented that this was\nthe most sellable collection of Kane\u2019s\ncareer. Regardless of this, with his ability and level-headedness, Kane\u2019s future\nseems assured.\nThis season\u2019s London wild card came\nin the form of Vivienne Westwood\u2019s\nRed Label show, a shouty affair that\nhad Lily Donaldson and company parading down the runway in reworked\nBritish classics channelling vivacious\nsecretaries, eccentrics and other King\u2019s\nRoad workaday gals. Hair was dishevelled and eyes deep-set, as tartans and\npinstripes clashed excitably with leath-er. Quintessential British prints were,\nagain, a strong theme. Surely the blue\nhoundstooth check will be a ubiquitous fixture in the glossies come fall.\nThe clothes were everything you\u2019d\nexpect from Westwood, but what\nabout the message? Models held placards and wore strategically placed political statements\u2014but ironically, the\nimpassioned political undercurrent\nthat made it such an exciting show also\nundermined the collection\u2019s message. It\nfelt like open warfare as opposed to the\nbackhanded commentary provided by,\nsay, a Hussein Chalayan spectacle, and\nas a statement was about as subtle as\na Sherman tank rolling into Downing\nStreet. Understatement and the ability to speak plainly are both strengths\nfashion possesses\u2014but given the current climate of unrest one has to wonder how to appropriately respond, and\nWestwood is clearly contemplating\nthis.\nGiles Deacon\u2019s show on Wednesday\nevening was a dark and breathtaking\nspectacle.

While Deacon\u2019s London peers have toned down\ntheir avant-garde tendencies as of late,\nDeacon\u2019s collections have lost none of\ntheir profligacy, or desirability.\nThe House of Holland show was a\nbreath of fresh air in a week packed\nwith all things dark and gothic. What\ncan be said about it? The show\u2019s look\nwas typical Holland and Deyn\u2014complete with acid bright colours and suf-focatingly hip skinny jeans. Incorporating a signature tartan, along with a\nhumorously concocted house coat of\narms, Holland sealed the deal for him-self, and there is enough in the collec-watch: move over Paris, Milan & New York.

The\ncrack team of Felix Music reviewers were there to bear witness and shake their asses\nPeter Sinclair\nMusic Editor\nI\nsometimes pride myself on having a pretentious, inaccessible\ntaste in music, but this week I\nthink it has backfired. A convoluted set of circumstances\nhas just led me to discover The Moldy\nPeaches (it wasn\u2019t Juno), a band who\nI\u2019m now totally in love with after a 48\nhour extreme-listening session. Pretty\nimpressive for a band with one studio\nalbum to their name. My friends back\nhome used to bone on about them and\nI never gave them a second thought\nbecause in general they listen to shit,\nbut now I regret it. Sorry Hannah and\nLara. It\u2019s just got me thinking \u2013 how\nmuch music have I written off just\nbecause they have been NME poster\nboys, or I didn\u2019t like the name, or they\nwere recommended to me someone\nwhose jeans were just that bit too\nskinny? Probably loads, but then at\nthe same time, most NME poster boys,\nmost bands with shit names, and most\nbands recommended to me by people\nwith skinny jeans are indeed quite shit.\nSo I didn\u2019t doubt myself for long. I\u2019ll\ntake The Moldy Peaches as the exception that proves the rule.\nTake for example this weeks PYTs,\nPete and the Pirates, whom, you will\nnotice, our resolute and fearless reviewers have diligently reviewed for\nyou. Earning themselves an unenviable\n2 stars, they are the embodiment, and\nthus categorical evidence, of my point\nin paragraph one. A bad band with an\neven worse name. Or the other way\nround. Why have we bothered reviewing it, you ask? Two reasons, I answer.\nReviews which totally destroy bands\ntend to be funnier, and there is a noticeable lack of the word \u2018swashbuckling\u2019 in the press these days, especially\nthe Music Media. We\u2019re bring it back,\nbaby!\nAlso in this weeks copy, Iambic2\ns latest release on Laridae, a free internet\nbased label specialising in ambient,\nchill-out and all things electric. Free\nmusic? That\u2019s right. All of their releases from all of their artists are available\nin full for FREE on their website www.\nlaridae.at. With illegal downloads of\neverything but the kitchen sink available on sketchy Russian websites, labels like this could well become a big\nfeature in the hazy future of the music\nindustry.\nWhat\u2019s more, we\u2019ve got a live review\nfrom big fat rapper Guilty Simpson,\nthe latest MC to emerge from Toronto/\nAtlanta-based underground hip-hop\nlabel Stones Throw. This label is pretty\nmuch the Buckingham Palace of hip-hop, home to the royal family of funky\nfresh beats. From J Dilla, to Madlib, to\nMF Doom. Oh man, so good. We expect large things from this large man.\nAnd an absolute motherfucking shit-load of singles! This and oh, so much\nmore. I don\u2019t want to give any more\naway as there\u2019s proper articles to your\nright. So just shut up and read the re-views, OK?\nDetroit\u2019s fastest rising alternative hip-hopper, Guilty Simpson, made his\nway down to Cargo last Saturday on\nthe third leg of his UK and European\ntour. The tour comes in advance of his\nalbum, \u2018Ode to the Ghetto\u2019, set for release on March 24th through Stones\nThrow Records. Guilty has built up a\nbit of a reputation in the last few years,\nappearing on J Dilla and Madlibs left-field masterpiece \u2018Champion Sound\u2019\nin 2003, as well as various guest spots\nwith Dabrye, Black Milk and Dilla\nhimself. With all this to his name, it\nwas only a matter of time until Guilty\nSimpson broke out on his own.\nThe venue, Cargo, couldn\u2019t have been\na better choice. Even before the MCs\ntook the stage, the Dilla beats were\nreverberating around the brick tunnel\narches. Around 10pm, the DJ kicked it\nup a notch after being given a bottle of\nCourvoisier on the house. The classic\nhip-hop fans in the crowd approved.\nFirst to hit the stage was old skooler\nPercee P, delivering a clean cut, no-frills opener to get the mouths salivat-ing. Although his lyricism was pretty\ngood and blazing out a couple of hot\nshit acapella verses during the set, I\nwas left feeling a bit underwhelmed all\nin all. His delivery was clean, but a bit\ntoo polished for the gritty underground\nsound that makes Stones Throw artists\nstand out. I\u2019d heard a bit of his music\nbefore, but somehow expected more\nfrom his live show. All in all though it\nwasn\u2019t a bad set \u2013 his experience was\nplain to see and he worked the crowd\npretty well, softening us up for the\nmain event.\nSo then Guilty stepped up, the main\nfeature of the night, and expectations\nin the room were high. Filling up the\nstage with his 6-foot brick shithouse\nframe, if there\u2019s one thing this boy has,\nit\u2019s stage presence. Without hesitation\nhe launched straight into tracks from\nhis album, with the aggressive delivery\nthat\u2019s fast becoming his calling card.\nApparently honed in the Detroit battling scene, his poise and tone could be\nsaid to be remnants of his early days. As\nthe night went on though, his performance seemed to lack the variety I was\nexpecting, the kind of variety you normally get from the more underground\nside of hip-hop. I mean, it wasn\u2019t bad,\nbut there was definitely a lack of the\nkind of off-the-wall wit, both in the\nlyrics and in the performance, that you\nnormally get from Stones Throw art-ists. Almost all verses that I could hear\nseemed to revolve around the same\nkind of \u2018Guns, Gangsters and Ghetto\u2019\nthemes that fixates the mainstream.\nMaybe I was just expecting great\nthings \u2013 Madlib and Dilla both make\nappearances in the production of the\nbeats which really can\u2019t be faulted, but\nthere was something in the MC side of\nthings which just didn\u2019t match up to\nthe (possibly overly) hyped expectations I had.\nIt wasn\u2019t all bad though. As I said,\nthe beats were undoubtedly great, and\nwhen Guilty got in the zone he could\nbe pretty mesmerising. If he loosened\nup a bit, he could put on a good show.\nAfter a brief stop in Sheffield, Guilty\nis heading across the Channel to continue the tour, so tell all your European\nfriends to check him out if they can.\nBut, you know\u2026don\u2019t stress the point.\nPeter Sinclair\nGuilty Simpson\nCargo\n16th February, 2008\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nGuilty Simpson at Cargo last Saturday. Photography by James Houghton\nEliot Lipp\nThe Outside\nMush Records\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nContinuing the Unintentional Detroit Theme \u2013 Eliot Lipp\n\u2018The Outside\u2019 is the latest LP from the\nL.A. based electro/hip-hop producer\nEliot Lipp released on Mush Records.\nFor those who don\u2019t know, Lipp\u2019s dis-cographyspansoverthepastfouryears,\nwith his first LP \u2018S/T\u2019 being released\non Eastern Developments, which is\nowned by Scott Herren (one part of\nPrefuse 73). On first listen to \u2018The\nOutside\u2019, Herren\u2019s influence on Lipp\u2019s\nmusic from both a technical and musical standpoint is very obvious, with\ncertain songs having a strong Prefuse\n73 vibe to them. However as the album\nprogresses, the hypnotic intertwining\nlayers of analogue synthesis and chilled\nelectro glitch-hop beats create an almost building sensation. But nothing\nreally happens. It\u2019s like that point on a\nFriday night when you\u2019re getting ready\nto go out, you\u2019ve donned the dancing\nshoes and slapped on the Old Spice \u2013\nnothing can stop you now! Then the\nphone rings; it\u2019s all your friends telling you they\u2019re no longer going out, so\nyou spend the Friday night alone, crying into that beer you cracked open an\nhour ago to get into the mood.\nTo cheer you up, variety is something this album does not lack in, and\nmakes up for the somewhat minimal\nsense of direction. From the chilled\ntwisting bass line of \u2018Opening Ceremony\u2019 (which is seems to be one of\nthe stand-out tunes on the album), to\nthe industrial feel of \u2018The Machine and\nthe Wind\u2019, you can really tell that Lipp\ntakes influences from many different\nstyles and incorporates them with his\ntrademark minimal electro lead synth\nlines. As a fan of Prefuse 73, I couldn\u2019t\nbut help notice the similarities that this\nalbum has to parts of \u2018One Word Extinguisher\u2019, this is not necessarily a bad\npoint, but if you\u2019re a pretentious muso\nwho gets kicks from only listening to\noriginal artists stay away, as this album\nwill, in places, let you down.\nFor the more average listener, one\nwho doesn\u2019t insist on listening to\nSquarepusher\u2019s latest million beats\nper second ring-modulated funk bass\nnoise (which I am actually a fan of) and\nclaiming it to be the best thing since\u2026\nwell, his last album, I\u2019d recommend\nthis LP as simply something to chill to.\nLipp\u2019s lack of overall theme, complex\nbeats, emotional builds and direction\nis made up by the perfectly blended\nmonophonic tones of his Korg MS-20\nsynthesiser and his minimal, kicked\nback Los Angeles beats. Personally, I\nfind great comfort in the fact people\nare still making albums like this, keeping the old dirt filled electro vibe going but adding a new age IDM edge to\nspice things up. Think original Detroit\ntechno, modernised and turned into\nhip hop; then you\u2019ll have something\nwhich vaguely resembles this album.\nGuy Andrews\nEliot Lipp\nEliot Lipp\u2019s \u2018The Outside\u2019 is out\non April 8th on Mush Records\nIf you fancy becoming a Music\nFelix editor, drop us an email at\nmusic.felix@gmail.com and get\nyourself added to the mailing list.\nFree CDs and gigs all the time,\nyou can\u2019t go wrong really.\n\n"

    "content": "Translational research at Imperial\nDr Tariq Ali is Director of the Energy and Environment Office (EEO). Irini Kyriacou and Federica\nDalamel de Bournet met with him to talk about his work, the role of the EEO and Scarlett Johansson\nO\nn a frosty clear January morning,\nwe went along to the elegant Edwardian building at 58 Princes Gate\nwhich hosts the Energy and Environment Office (EEO). Climbing\nup a couple of flights of stairs, we found ourselves\nin Dr Tariq Ali\u2019s bright and airy office. We knew\nthat the EEO has a central role in promoting and\nnurturing Imperial\u2019s environmental research, but\nlittle else. Fortunately Dr Ali was kind enough to\ntell us more.\nHow did you come to be the Director of the Energy and Environment Office?\nI was in the Astrophysics group in the physics de-partment, working away minding my own busi-ness. But I was vice-chairman of the National\nOrganisation of Scientists in my spare time. At\naround 1998 Lord Oxburgh \u2013 the Rector at Imperial \u2013 and the Deputy Rector decided that, strate-gically, College could have a major impact in three\nkey areas: Energy, Environment and Healthcare.\nWe were all working in an interdisciplinary mode,\nand we felt we had a lot to offer and that we could\nbe world leaders in some areas. In healthcare, it\nwas slightly different so he set about doing that.\nHowever, what he asked me to do was to set up\nthe Energy and Environment office, which was\ncalled the Environment Office at the time.\nWhat did your job entail? How were the beginnings of the Environment Office?\nI didn\u2019t have a job description as such, or a mission of statement but my job was to make interdisciplinary research happen \u2013 get projects\ntogether that were interdisciplinary, and work\nacross the departments. At that time there were\n20 departments and all sort of verticals per faculty structure. So the Environment Office was set\nup to focus on research, facilitate and initiate new\nprojects \u2013 anything to do with the environment\nthat was interdisciplinary. One thing we had at\nthe time was a network which I had set up called\nthe Environment Forum, which had about 250 researchers working on environmental projects.\nWhat does EEO work on?\nWe work right across from basic research to\ntranslational research, and with industry partners\nall around the world. We act as the first point of\ncontact and do a lot with the media \u2013 a lot of producers and journalists call me up. We also deal\na lot with the investor community, people who\nwant to invest in our technologies both at the\nR&D level but also at the spin-out level, or licencing our technologies.\nWhat are the links between industry and Imperial College in the environmental field ?\nDialogue with companies and research coun-cils, as well as other institutions is a significant\npart of what I do: building the bridges between\nthe external drivers in environmental science and\nsustainability and us, to get an alignment. We did\nthat quite successfully, and we\u2019ve had a number of\nprojects that kicked off. I also helped set up the\nStrategic Alliance with BP on the environment. It\nstarted in 2000 as totally focused on the environ-ment, and resulted in 60 consultancy projects all\nround the environmental theme. Subsequently,\nthey gave us millions of pounds for working on\nnext-generation photovoltaics, solar energy, carbon capture and related issues both from the\ntechnology perspective and also the policy per-spective. Shell has provided for the Future Fossils\nProgramme, run by Professor Geoffrey Maitland\nin the Chemical Engineering department.\nAny other exciting joint projects with\nIndustry?\nWe\u2019ve got the Urban Energy Systems Program\nwhich is a multimillion pound initiative. This is\nquite exciting because it\u2019s the first time anyone\nhas attempted this. We went to BP and said: \u201cBy\n2030 most of the world\u2019s population will be living\nin mega-cities. These are your customers, do you\nunderstand what the impact is going to be on you\nas a business on a wider global perspective?\u201d They\nsaid \u201cno\u201d. So we put together this programme\n(UESP) that is led by Professor David Fisk in Civil\nEngineering and Professor Nilay Shah of Process\nSystems Engineering in the Chemical Engineering department.\nHow supportive have College been with these\ninitiatives?\nWhen Sir Richard Sykes came along as the new\nRector he was totally supportive and understood the strategic importance of energy in the\nenvironment.\nDoes the EEO have any links with governmental environment bodies?\nI am on the Energy Minister\u2019s Renewables Advisory Board, and I have been for the last four years.\nIt\u2019s kind of an independent industry-led body; I\nthink I am the only academic on it. What we do\nis we provide independent advice to the Government and also make recommendations. One of\nthe things we have done for example is to extend\nthe targets for renewables for the UK which was\ntaken by the ministers. We actually work in helping to shape the UK\u2019s national strategy in key\ntechnology areas. Imperial has an important role\nin this.\nHow about the new MSc in Sustainable Energy\nFutures?\nYes, this is one of the things I was really keen to\ndo and Professor Sandro Macchietto took\nthe challenge and has been the driving\nforce behind it. There are quite a few\nenergy Masters courses around the\nworld.Wehaveprobablythebiggest\ncoverage and the greatest depth.\nWe have more projects in energy\nthat anywhere in Europe. Because\nof that we are able to offer a really coherent programme, suitable\nnot only for young people coming\nstraight from their first degree, but\nalso for more mature people from\nindustry who are looking to understand what\u2019s happening from\na science, technology, economics\nand policy perspective.\nAny plans for a new Masters programme on Renewable Energy and\nthe Environment?\nThere is a major initiative in biofuels:\nthe Porter Alliance. It may well be\nthat in due course we may have\na specific MSc program\naround the whole issue of biofuels.\nAnd Solar Energy?\nWe have big lead in solar energy. It turns out we\ncould meet all of our domestic heating requirements from solar panels. We\u2019ve got the next generation of solar panels which are going to be 10\nor maybe 100 times cheaper. That\u2019s what Professor James Durrant at the Chemistry department\nis working on. So from an innovation perspective\nwe have the lead in a lot of things. We don\u2019t have\nmuch geothermal or biomass, but then again we\ndon\u2019t have much land for biomass. However, we\nmustn\u2019t think of the UK as geographically constrained because it\u2019s all about creating ideas and\nnew technologies that will have a global impact.\nJust how worried should we be about climate\nchange?\nI am just sceptical about political leadership or\npolitical institutions being able to do anything in\ntrying to stabilise 450ppm CO2. I am\nnervous personally whether we are even going to\nmake it. That is 2-3\ndegrees. And actually\npeople think that\nif you hit 550ppm\nthat\u2019s it; that it\u2019s\nkind of a vertical\nswitch. But it\u2019s a\ndistribution and\nthere is still a\n20% chance\nthat we are\ngoing to get\n5 degrees,\nso even if\nyou stabilise at\n550ppm you\u2019ve\ngot an uncertainty in our\nunderstanding.\nSo the model predicts a 2-3 degree\nincrease, but actually it could\nbe 5\nThe AtlanTICC Alliance initials stand for\nTransatlantic Innovation and Commercialization Centre.\nIt is essentially a collaboration between\nthree of the world\u2019s leading centres of\nexcellence in sustainable energy; Oak\nRidge National Lab, Georgia Institute of\nTechnology and of course Imperial College. Oak Ridge, the largest Department\nof Energy National Lab in the United\nStates has formed its only partnership\noutside the US with Imperial College.\n\u2018This is a real honour, a feather in our\ncaps!\u201d, proudly boasts Dr Tariq Ali.\nAnd their are tangible benefits too: Imperial researchers now have access to\notherwise unavailable multimillion dollar\ninfrastructure and equipment.\nThis is a major initiative in bioenergy\nand biomaterials led by Professor Richard Templer along with Dr Tariq Ali. The\nPorter Alliance brings together more\nthan 100 scientists, engineers and policy\nmakers from Imperial College and other\nleading UK institutions to help commer-cialise the technology. As the Business\nDevelopment Manager, Mr Rafat Malik is\nresponsible for making sure that there is\nan alignment between the research carried out and industry, thus making it possible to reach the product development\nstage. As Dr Ali puts it, \u201cTo make a difference we have got to get this technology\nout, there is no point in just publishing\npapers\u201d.\nA holistic approach is neceassary to ensure safer and cleaner energy supplies for all\n6\n\n"

The BAFTA award-winning recipient of 14 honorary\ndegrees plays the voice of How\nto Succeed, the narrating book.\nThe Professor\u2019s dulcet tones,\nsoothing the ears of the nation\non the BBC, will be soothing audience members\u2019 ears throughout the night in the UCH, Tuesday to Saturday next week.\n\u201cEagles may soar high, but weasels\ndon\u2019t get sucked into jet engines.\u201d \u2013\nwise words indeed from the self-styled\nbusiness guru, David Brent. That said,\nRicky Gervais\u2019 character in his hit sit-com, The Office is not the first to generate such nuggets of wisdom. A shred\nof deviousness here and a dash of chicanery there had been staple features of\nthe business of satire, long before Gervais was even a twinkle in his father\u2019s\neye. The universal popularity of office-based comedy lies in the fact that we\ncan all, whether we have experience in\nthat environment or not, relate to the\ncharacters and situations portrayed;\nthe schoolyard politics, over-zealous\nstereotypes and grating one-upman-ship are inherently familiar.\nPerhaps that\u2019s why in 1952, when\nShepherd Mead published the satirical self-help book, How To Succeed\nIn Business Without Really Trying, it\nbecame an instant best-seller. Drawn\nfrom his own experiences in the business world, the book\u2019s \u201cadvice\u201d struck a\nchord with everyone from Wall Street\nto Broadway. Indeed, it inspired both\nthe composer and writer of Guys And\nDolls, Frank Loesser and Abe Burrows,\nto adapt it into a stage musical of the\nsame name which, upon its debut in\n1961, swept the awards board, netting\nseven Tonys (the theatrical equivalent\nto the Oscars) and a Pullitzer prize.\nThis Spring, ICU\u2019s Musical Theatre\nSociety, MTSoc, takes on this iconic\nshow. In a departure from recent years\u2019\nmore modern pieces (Batboy, Little\nShop of Horrors, A Slice of Saturday\nNight, etc.) this more traditional musical brings a sense of freshness to the\nstage of the Union Concert Hall. The\ndecades that have passed since its conception have only served to reinforce\nthe plot and if anything, it\u2019s more relevant now than it ever was.\nThe show tells the story of a hopeless\nwindow washer, J. Pierrepont Finch,\nwho comes across a book, How To Succeed In Business. He decides to leave\nhis old life behind, following the book\u2019s\nsimple tips to climb the corporate lad-der. After getting his foot in the front\ndoor of the World Wide Wicket Company, Finch rapidly begins to make his\nmove out of the mail-room and into\nthe executive pool. Watching his career with eager interest are Rosemary\nPilkington, a secretary who has her\nheart set on spending the rest of her\nlife with an oblivious Finch, and Bud\nFrump, the president\u2019s nephew who is\ndismayed to see Finch succeed in getting promoted where his own schemes\nhave failed.\nAs Finch tricks his way into promotion after promotion, the show\u2019s wide\narray of colourful characters provide\nrich satirical insight into the business\nworld with musical numbers such as\nthe very tongue-in-cheek \u2018A Secretary\nIs Not A Toy\u2019 and the simply manic\n\u2018Coffee Break\u2019. Whether Finch\u2019s success is due to the ineptitude of his colleagues or the advice of the book (the\ndulcet tones of Professor Lord Robert Winston) is anyone\u2019s guess, but if\nwatching his bizarre progress is anywhere near as fun as it has been playing\nthe character myself, then you won\u2019t be\ndisappointed.\nJ. Pierrepont Finch is a far cry from\nmy last two appearances on that stage:\nJimmy-Jack Cassie, the unwashed,\ndrunken yet brilliant Irishman (Dramsoc\u2019s Translations) and Dr. Thomas\nParker, the obsessive, insane, murderousveterinarian(MusicalTheatreSoc\u2019s\nBatboy). As it becomes clear throughout the course of the show, Finch is\nas much of an idiot as the rest of the\nmale workforce (the secretaries being\nthe brains behind the business) and\nI\u2019ve always enjoyed playing the fool.\nBut Finch\u2019s real charm comes from his\nchildlike naivety and dependence on\nthe book he carries everywhere with\nhim. Despite his tricks and deception,\nit\u2019s difficult not to wish him success.\nAfter six years, this will almost certainly be my last Spring Show with\nMTSoc before I embark on my own\ncareer. Fitting, then, that this particular show is my swansong. After all, the\nmajority of us come to Imperial College to improve our chances of succeeding in business before launching\nourselves into a world we know nothing about. So, I urge you, make some\ntime next week (or have your personal\nassistant do it for you) to come and see\nthis excellent show. Who knows, you\nmight learn a thing or two!\nThis is what Musical Theatre Soc has to offer you: lots of lovely ladies, and the opportunity to have them carry you about like you\u2019re royalty\nSebastian Junemann\n\n"

Granted, there have\nbeen times when I could have\nthrown the bloody thing out of\nthe nearest window, followed it\nto the street with a large hammer and\ntaken it apart, piece by blasted piece,\nbut then again, haven\u2019t we all? Sure,\nI\u2019ve sometimes been forced round in\nlogical Mobius strips by nonsensical\nerror messages urging me to perform\nimpossible commands over and over\nagain. Of course I\u2019ve had hypertensive\ncrises installing programs, uninstalling\nprograms, reinstalling programs, re-booting software, and playing solitaire,\nbut somehow it never really got to me.\nUntil now.\nI\u2019m a fairly impatient person. I can\ntake quite a lot of aggravation, but\nthere comes a point when I go off like\na 06:00 alarm clock in a neighbour\u2019s\nroom. Not too many things have the\npower to make the vein in my forehead\npalpitate and turn burgundy, but it\nseems that the list is expanding. Until\nnow, these nought-to-sixty transitions\nhave been almost entirely the result of\nhuman interference. Irritating salesmen calling you during dinner, twisted\nmedia coverage of stories close to your\nheart and anyone with a handshake\nlike a cold trout that\u2019s very, very dead.\nThese special creatures, and a few oth-ers, really know how to pull my levers.\nBut now, it seems, there\u2019s something\nelse on my list. For the last half hour I\nhave been in a shaking white-hot rage\nunequalled since Pliny the Younger\nA\ns any engineer will tell\nyou, no matter how many\ncalculations you do there\nis no substitute for ex-perimentation. Mechanical engineers have the common sense,\nwhen designing containers for nuclear\nwaste, to put them on trucks and drive\nthem into the central reservation, put\nthem on trucks and drive them into\nbridges, put them on trucks and, wait\nfor it, drive whole trains into them just\nto see what will happen. For real. Civil\nengineers get the brunt of public (or at\nleast my) mockery because it\u2019s harder\nto build a model stadium and test it\nout so you can realize that a little snow\nmight break the roof, or that if you put\nImperial: A fool\u2019s paradise?\nlooked across the Bay of Naples in AD\n79 and briefly described what was happening to Pompeii. I wrote a full column just under two hours ago, and\nit has now vanished into the abyss of\nVanished Documents.\nScrew the Turing Test; this is the\ntrue yardstick to measure technological progress. If this deceptively sleek\nand annoyingly efficient pile of transistors can make steam come out of my\nears, then artificial intelligence is not a\nmyth. If this lump of metal and plastic,\nforged together by Beelzebub himself\nin the heretofore undisclosed VIP-only\neighth circle of Hell, can mess with my\nmind to this extent, I declare defeat.\nOf course I\u2019ve heard the disaster sto-ries. Friends of mine have lost university applications through digital sad-ism, Mac-hiavellian torture has caused\nhavoc in the workplaces of family\nmembers, and my grandparents continue to look on their new computer\nas a Satanic intruder into the quiet of\ntheir homes.\nBut I always expected that could hap-pen. I saved everything compulsively\n(Ctrl+s). I copied things into e-mails\nand sent them to my gmail account\n(Ctrl+s). I read things out loud just in\ncase they should get lost and I have to\nuse key sentences (Ctrl+s) to help me\nwrite it out again. But now? With my\ndisarmingly shiny new Sony laptop,\na seemingly user-friendly Microsoft\nVista, and the beguiling come-use-me\ninterface of Office 2007, surely nothing\ncan go wrong.\nAnd that\u2019s when the bastard strikes.\nWhen I\u2019m weak and helpless; sure\nthat at last I have a device capable of\nresponding to my every command,\nindulging my slightest whim.

And now I\u2019m supposed\nto smile, shrug it off, and write another\nfive hundred brain-freezing, spleen-engorging, gut-wrenching, hair-pull-ing, vomit-inducing, sodding words. I\nwon\u2019t do it. You can\u2019t make me do it.\nNo. Way.\nTo be honest, this has been fairly ca-thartic. I can really see why columnists\nenjoy weekly torrents of abuse. I could\nmake a habit of this.

Testing is no doubt the only\nway to go, and you have got to enjoy\nbeing paid to fire dead chickens into a\njet engine under the pretense of \u201cengineering\u201d. Can we then continue calling\nthings foolproof without genuine test-ing? Certainly not!\nNow you will see the dilemma this\ncreates for the market-leading companies wanting to prove themselves; how\ncan they find genuine high-quality\nfools on whom to test out their products and can they legally do it without\ninfringing on human rights? I know\nthat there are those who understandably stand firmly in the \u201cI don\u2019t think we\nshould kill the stupid people, just take\naway the obvious warnings (which now\nplague every surface I lay eyes on) and\nlet the problem sort itself out\u201d camp,\nbut with people now suing their own\npre-school children almost for sport,\nthe shrewd manager is wary of doing\nanything out of the ordinary, least of all\nwith someone who could conceivably\nmanage to hang themselves with only\na bottle of shampoo if left alone for 30\nseconds.\nBut let\u2019s say they risk it.

One that is able to\nweed out all the fake fools in it for the\nmoney and all the only partially stupid\nones and leave the real cream of the\ncrop \u2026 or skin on the milk, or whatever the negative equivalent is. And\nthey have to get them to apply. And\nthen turn up. It\u2019s a logistical nightmare\ntrying to offer a job to someone who\nwould demonstrate that they weren\u2019t\nfit for it simply by accepting. Say you\nactually get them to the point of taking some form of test. Is \u201cduck loins\u201d a\nsuitable answer to a simple maths ques-tion? Are they the words of a true fool,\nor a fake? I suppose the way forward\nwould be to just funnel people off the\nstreet as they walk past and see if they\nget stuck in the revolving doors.

    "content": "I\nIf anyone had told me a few years ago that\ncoal was to become trendy, I would have\ntold them they were crazier than a naked\nguy riding a saddleless bike. Although it has\nnever really gone away, coal is perceived by\nthe public as a dirty resource that belongs to an-other, less advanced, time. It is indeed dirty but\nit\u2019s far from being relegated to the history books.\nNot only does it still provide a colossal portion of\nour energy supply \u2013 more than 50% of the United\nStates\u2019 power stations run on coal \u2013 but it also\nhas prospects which are bright and, if I may say,\nshiny.\nCharleroi is a Belgian city, famous for its fries,\nits beer and a glorious past built on the back of\na redoubtable and powerful coal industry. Now\nit\u2019s just one of those cities that has never recovered from the decline of coal related activities\n\u2013 the unemployment rate is one of the highest\nin Belgium, violence is everywhere and the future\ndoesn\u2019t seem to hold anything pleasant in store.\nI\u2019ve taken the example of Charleroi, but I could\nhave taken the example of any number of cities\nin other European coal centres such as Northern France or South Wales, each of them having\nsuffered a similar fate. Lack of efficiency, tough\nworking conditions and competition from other\nenergy sources (such as oil or nuclear power) and\nother continents, where labour was cheaper and\nwhere \u2018open air\u2019 mines often made it much cheaper to extract coal are the main reasons the coal\nindustry in Western Europe declined so swiftly\nin the latter part of the last century. The perception of coal as an archaic energy source, produced\nby an industry that sustains poverty more than\nanything else is, to a great extent, biased by the\ntrauma associated with this decline.\nWhile thousands of jobs were lost in Europe\nwhen this labour intensive industry disappeared,\ncoal continued to play a vital role in the development of another giant; China. For the last\ntwenty years, the Chinese authorities have been\nusing coal as a key component in their search for\ngrowth. More than 80% of Chinese electricity\ncomes from coal \u2013 more than double the world\naverage \u2013 and in 2005, around five coal power\nstations were opened every week. Of course,\nthis single-minded focus on coal has costs, both\nhuman (around 5,500 Chinese miners die every\nyear) and environmental (China\u2019s carbon emissions from coal use account for approximately\n10% of the world\u2019s CO2 emissions) but this focus\nalso provides an invaluable boost to the economy,\nBlack is back: The return of coal\nThe future\u2019s bright, but it ain\u2019t orange \u2013 coal\u2019s making a comeback! Roger Rouhana tells us why coal is cool\nallowing millions of people to leave poverty every\nyear \u2013 lest we forget, in a country where more\nthan 200 million individuals still live with less\nthan a dollar a day.\nChina\u2019s insatiable need for energy is not the\nonly reason making coal an essential element in\ntomorrow\u2019s energetic landscape. The explosion of\nthe demand for energy is common to many other\ndeveloping countries such as India, Brazil or Russia, adding pressure to dwindling energy resourc-es. This plays an important part in the future development of coal \u2013 it enjoys a relatively high cost\nefficiency, up to 6 times less expensive than oil\nand gas. Moreover, coal resources are distributed\nmuch more evenly than the oil and gas resources:\ncoal can be found on practically all continents,\nand in abundant quantities (pessimistic estimations give us more than 100 years of coal based\non the present consumption standards), which\ncould release many countries from the energetic\ndependence they have on others.\nIt seems clear that coal is here to stay, whether we invest more in green energies or not, and\nwhether we invest more in nuclear power or not.\nUnless major breakthroughs in the energy domain are found, this polluting energy is to have a\nbig stake in the future diversity of energy systems\nand the only thing to do about it is really to find\nreasonable and cost effective ways to control it\nand make it less ecologically harming.\nIn the wake of the Kyoto agreements, some\nGovernments have taken action against carbon\nemissions; an example of one such initiative is the\nEuropean Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU\nETS) which demonstrates the European Union\u2019s\nleadership on climate change. This plan allows\nfirms to buy and exchange \u2018pollution credits\u2019 between themselves, acting like a tax on pollution.\nAfter a difficult (and not very efficient) start, this\nscheme has proven to be very successful, and\nhas had a significant impact. It\u2019s not universally\nlauded \u2013 many companies see it as a direct attack\nto their competitivity as companies polluting outside Europe are not constrained by the EU ETS.\nHowever, a positive effect of this plan has been\nto oblige companies to invest in ways to pollute\nless, notably in the research and development of\ngreener ways of producing, therefore using fewer\n\u2018polluting credits\u2019, In the steel industry, where\ncarbon emissions could add more than 20% to\nthe original costs, initiatives have been taken\nto reduce the energy consumption and investments have been made in carbon sequestration\ntechnologies.\nInnovative technologies should therefore be the\nkey to the control of what seems to be an inevitable increase in carbon use. Many heads of companies are hoping the Carbon Capture and Storage\n(CCS) technology will relieve their pain. CCS is,\nas the name suggests, a process that captures carbon dioxide from sources of significant emission\n(such as coal power plants) and stores it either in\nunderground geological formations (such as depleted oil or gas fields) or directly in the ocean (A\nthird way called mineral storage also exists, which\ninvolves reacting carbon with other minerals to\nproduce carbonates, but this process is very cost\nand energy intensive).\nRegrettably, despite seeming promising on the\nface of it, this technology has costs associated\nwith it, which may be great. Some costs are fi-nancial: adding the necessary infrastructure onto\nnew and existing plants has an economical cost,\nincreasing the price of a plant by up to 90%. Despite it being less expensive to build new plants\nequipped with CSS kits than adding them to\nexisting plants, without public incentives, firms\nwouldn\u2019t be very keen on taking such initiatives.\nOther potential costs are environmental: storing\nthousands of tons of carbon underground or even\nin the oceans may have undesirable effects, such\nas the acidification of the ocean, or dangerous\nleakages of carbon dioxide, which could be lethal\nto the surrounding environment. Finally, somewhat ironically, the CSS process dramatically\nincreases energy consumption , by up to 50% in\nsome cases.\nNevertheless, the overall savings for the atmosphere are tremendous as it is estimated that a\nplant equipped with a CSS system could reduce\nits carbon emissions by more than 90%. And such\nsystems will play a central role \u2013 as Malcolm\nWicks, the British Energy Minister, notes:\n\u201cWhatever the most fierce environmentalists\nmay say and wish, the world is going to be burning lots of carbon, particularly loads and loads of\ncoal, for 100, 200 years to come\u201d.\ndegrees which would be catastrophic.\nSo how do you meet the aspirations of the developing world who quite rightly want to get out\nof poverty and decouple that from environmental impact? To have an increase in quality of life\nmeans provision of energy \u2013 you need to decou-ple that from emissions and decouple that from\nenvironmental impact. You can do it but it means\nconfiguring the engineering systems.\nHow is Imperial involved in tackling climate\nchange?\nWe\u2019ve got the Grantham Institute which is a major new effort. We have tremendous expertise in\ncertain parts of biodiversity with Professor Georgina Mace (Biology), hydrology with Professor\nHarold Wheater in Civil Engineering, and in the\nPhysics Department in terms of earth observa-tion, and modelling and understanding of clouds.\nProfessor Jo Haigh is fantastic and an expert in\nradiative transfer in the atmosphere and the roles\nof clouds which are big uncertainties in GCM\nmodels. There is a lot of expertise around College, and the Grantham Institute is going to be\nable to capture that and articulate it in a way that\nanswers some of the bigger questions. Sir Brian\nHoskins has been appointed as the first director.\nHe is an outstanding scientist and we are very\nlucky to have someone of his calibre to come in\nas the director.\nI\u2019ve been getting more and more personally involved in climate change. I am involved in a charity called Global Cool. You may have heard of it.\nSienna Miller and big celebs are involved. I helped\nlaunch it about a year ago \u2013 I was on the platform\ngiving a science talk and right up there with me\nwere KT Tunstall and Josh Hartnett. Jesus, he is\nsuch a good looking bastard, it\u2019s awful! He is 6 foot\n3 and I was standing next to him thinking \u2018this is\nterrible\u2019. Luckily, when they were doing the photo\nshoot, somebody took pity on me and moved me\nto the other side, next to KT Tunstall! She\u2019s nice\nand very eloquent and very smart. Anyway Josh\nHartnett was really sad because he had just split\nup with... what\u2019s her name... Scarlett Johansson.\nAnd I was thinking I\u2019ve never even been in the\nsame country as Scarlett Johansson, I don\u2019t think!\nOh it\u2019s a funny old world.\nCromwell Road is one of the most polluted\nroads in England...\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised: do you remember that\nstory published in a paper by one of our researchers \u2013 Dr Roy Colvile? He said that air pollution\nin terms of particulate matter going into your\nsystem [depends on] how closely you stand to the\nedge of the curb: one metre back and you massively reduce the amount of rubbish going into\nyour lungs.x\nWhat sets Imperial apart from other\nUniversities?\nThe academics here are usually very easily motivated to work together, because of the culture\nof the place here. We are very pragmatic, very\npractical, we see challenges that may actually lead\nto new technology and commercial return, even\nthough sometimes research may be purely a science curiosity driven enterprise. We are a very\nsmall campus in South Kensington, and it is not\nthat far from Silwood and Wye, so it\u2019s easy to get\npeople together. There is a cohesion about Imperial, and a motivation to actually do what it takes\nto get the job done. Really we should be proud\nof our university. We don\u2019t advertise ourselves or\nmarket ourselves as well as the Americans do and\nas well as some of the other places do. There is\nsome fantastic work going on here.\nGlobal Cool is a charity which takes\na ground-up approach on climate\nchange by getting individuals to\nmake a personal commitment to\nreducing their carbon footprint.\nThe founders of Global Cool believe in the power of individuals to\ntackle climate change, without ignoring corporate responsibility.\nAn exciting joint-project is\ncurrently underway with Vodafone: next time you are in a Vodafone store, take a minute to look around\nand you might spot Sienna Miller on\nthe mobile phone recycling bin!\nVodafone gives approximately \u00a310\nper mobile phone recycled though\nthis scheme to Global Cool.\nThe money goes towards funding projects in Zambia: old kerosene lamps are exchanged for solar\npowered white light LEDs, a\nchange which make a massive\ndifference to the livelihoods of\npeople living in villages with absolutely no electricity.\nYou\u2019ve told us a lot about the academics, so\nwhat about the student body?\nOur students don\u2019t realise how good they are.\nObviously you are very good in science but you\nare also very knowledgeable, there are so many\ntalented musicians and sports people and writers and many other things. You can appreciate\nart, literature and culture and can contribute in\nso may ways.\nYou talk to people who study arts and have absolutely no clue about science, but so many people\nhere that I have met are fantastic musicians as\nwell as being good scientists.\nPeople don\u2019t realise how talented the students\nhere are, they are fantastic!\nSparklingly clean with an (Olympic?) torch to guide him through the tunnels\n7\n\n"

Everyone will be welcome to come and\npropose changes/actions. After all, this\nis still a democracy.\nDiogo Geraldes\nEdward Hughes\nI\nstarted Union life dedicated to\nenjoying things like sports and\nmusic. After three years, not\nonly do I continue to enjoy everything I can, I now hold positions of responsibility on committees I\nfeel strongly about.\nImperial College is well known for\nproducing graduates of the highest\nacademic standard. However, many\ngraduate without enjoying a fraction of\nwhat Imperial\u2019s Union has to offer. It\u2019s\nthe President\u2019s responsibility to fight\n\u2018Imperial Apathy\u2019 in every way pos-sible. People need to realise that Union activities aren\u2019t just great fun, but\nvastly rewarding. We need to regain\nour community spirit and common\nidentity; people should feel compelled\nto support fellow students at their\nevents.\nStudents need a voice to speak up\nwhen they have academic issues and,\nmore importantly, to know that the\nUnion will support them. As president,\nI promise to be that voice.\nICU has lost its\u2019 way as a good night\nout, in fact most people are just not\ninspired by Union events. It used to attract people from all over London and\nit still should! If elected, I will strive to\nmake the Union a better night out.\nThere are many issues to address \u2013\nfrom passive smoking to the pitfalls of\na claim form, from beer prices to the\nbureaucracy minefield of ICU\u2019s con-stitution. Furthermore, I know the\npresident isn\u2019t there to represent his/\nher views, but to represent all stu-dents. If elected, I will represent ALL\nstudents and their views to the best of\nmy abilities.\nDiogo Geraldes didn\u2019t attend his interview because he was in Portugal at the time\nWhat will you get from the\nNUS to make our membership\nworthwhile?\nImperial\u2019s not your typical university;\nit\u2019s not going to have the same needs\netc as other universitites. We need to\nshape what the NUS does and how it\nworks with us to our own particular\nneeds and not make it a waste of money for us.\nDo you feel you\u2019re truly representative in your views of the student\nbody, or do you think you\u2019re too\nclosely associated with a clique?\nI think this is probably the strongest\npoint to my campaign. I\u2019m someone\nthat\u2019s met a lot of people at Imperial.\nI\u2019ve played football and rugby and met\na lot of sporty people and I\u2019m also\nheavily involved in the musical side of\nImperial. I sing in the choir and play in\nthe IC Symphony Orchestra who I\u2019ve\norganised and been on tours with.\nA lot of people focus on the sports\nand forget about Imperial\u2019s excellent\nmusical side, so I think I can represent\nboth of their needs.\nWhat do you think of the Beit Masterplan so far?\nI think it\u2019s really good what Stephen\nBrown has done and that what we\u2019ve\ndone to daVinci\u2019s has made itt more\nairy. I think it\u2019s taking a long time but\nwhen it\u2019s finished it\u2019ll be good.\nCan you make dB\u2019s a credible venue and how?\nI was speaking to a postgrad who said\nthey used to have comedy nights in\ndB\u2019s that were packed out and I think\nit\u2019s something that needs to come back.\nI think the venue is alright at the mo-ment, it just needs to be marketed\nbetter. If you get people to one or two\nof the Union\u2019s event they enjoy the\nevents on offer; not much is required\nto change the venue.\nLive! has described \u201can entrenched\nattitude that certain things are operational issues\u201d, which prevents\nelected officers getting things\ndone. How would you tackle this\nto push through the changes you\nwant to make?\nAs a person I like to talk to people face\nto face. There is far too much bureaucracy at Imperial but I see the need for\nit \u2013 Imperial needs to be legally sound\n\u2013 but there\u2019s lots that can be changed.\nThe room booking system is horren-dous. It gets backlogged and backlogged and I think it would be great to\nget an online system.\nAlso, I think many candidates have\npolicy-after-policy-after-policy when\nreally you\u2019re there to represent the students\u2019 views and as President, you\u2019re\nnot just there to push through loads of\npolicies.\nOn what timescale can we expect\nyour promises to be delivered?\nI don\u2019t have proper policies, I just have\nwho I am and what I\u2019m about and what\nI want to happen, so I\u2019d say straight\naway. As soon as I get in I\u2019ll be changing the Union for the better in the ways\nI set out in my manifesto.\nWhere do you stand on the Higher\nEducation funding debate?\nI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s an entirely relevant\nquestion as the President is representing the students\u2019 views and I will\nbe fighting for their views regardless\nof mine. However, personally I think\ntop-up Fees are terrible; I don\u2019t want\nstudents to be paying more money. I\nthink we\u2019re suffering because the government wants so many people to get\ndegrees.\nWhat do you think about the Union\u2019s current regulations governing the student media?\nI don\u2019t know the facts so I can\u2019t give a\ncomplete answer, but I think it\u2019s very\nsad our Union is preventing the student press from giving the students\nthe news they would like to have. But\nat the same time, you can\u2019t slander\npeople and you can\u2019t jump down the\nstaffs\u2019 backs. Overall I\u2019m more liberal\non this; there should be more freedom\nof speech than there is.\nAre you Ken or Boris?\nBoris.\nPolitical Hack or Corporate Sellout?\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m either. Definitely not a\nPolitical Hack, so the other one.\n4\n\n"

    "content": "film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n27\nFriday 22 February 2008 felix\nFilm\nAronofsky and his Avant-Garde\nMatty Hoban\nDerided by critics upon its release, The Fountain was claimed to be a dent in the crown that Darren\nAronofsky had built himself. On reappraisal however, there\u2019s a definite case to be made for its merits\nAmbition in film is the path most\nfraught with danger; it can be divisive,\nawe-inspiring at best and deadly obtuse at worst. Aronofsky\u2019s The Fountain is a film that understands its own\nambition, yet refuses to be understood\nin terms of its ambition. Whilst being\nambitious almost to the point of avant-garde, it has at its core the fear of loss\nand immortality.\nCritics reacted negatively to The\nFountain. This put me off this movie,\nalong with the fact that a director renowned for ultra-realism is making a\nfantasy film for a studio that oppresses\nambitious filmmakers (Warner Brothers) unless they are cheap (Tim Burton). The tempestuous history behind\nThe Fountain\u2019s production is another\nstory which only serves to make the\nfilm more of a curiosity rather than a\nprofound work. However, I believe it is\nworthy of return and admiration.\nHugh Jackman is Tommy Creo, a\nmedical researcher who is trying to\nfind a cure for brain cancer, a condition\nthat his wife Izzy (played by Rachel\nWeisz) suffers from. Interlocked with\nthis simple story are another two sto-rylines, one that sees the immortal soul\nof Tommy Creo in a bubble in outer\nspace with a tree (that represents the\nsoul of Izzy), heading into the centre\nof a nebula, and the other centring the\nbook that Izzy is writing. Too book\nitself, called The Fountain, is set in\nConquistador era Spain and Central\nAmerica where Hugh Jackman\u2019s conquistador is in search of The Tree of\nLife to save Spain (and Queen Isabella)\nfrom the Spanish Inquisition and each\nstory intertwines with one another\nwhilst Jackman\u2019s intense performance\n(surprising I know) draws everything\ntogether convincingly. It also creates\nmore questions than answers, but then\nthis is brilliant \u2013 you cannot separate\nyourself from the film because your\ninterpretation is also intertwined with\nthe story; deconstructionism, the critic\u2019s best friend, becomes inept as each\nelement is connected irreducibly.\nAronofsky has only made three fea-ture-length movies to date, and never\nhas one director said so much in such\na small oeuvre. \u03c0 was about a trau-matised mathematician attempting to\nwork out the laws governing the stock\nmarket who ends up seeing recurring\npatterns everywhere until he is driven\nto ending this insight with a drill. In\nmy opinion, \u03c0 is a parallel film to The\nFountain, although where the former\nhas a black and white, rational insight\ninto nature that only serves to self-de-struction, the latter is ultimately a film\nin the Romantic tradition. Both films\nutilise a multitude of shots cut together quickly either in close-up, bordering\non intrusive, or widely expansive; this\nNo, not enough gold yet\nIC Film Festival without any Sci-Fi\nThe very best of the Imperial College auteurs step up to the challenge of the FilmSoc Short Film Festival\nall gives an unsettling and visceral feel\nthat you are never fully connected to\nthe characters, yet you share in their\nfeelings almost to the point of exploitation of the viewer. Requiem For A\nDream\u2019s finale is a tortuous resolution\nto a film that is a great example of this.\nAronofsky consistently says that humans are fragile and we as an audience\ncannot disconnect from this.\nHowever, in this bleak world-view,\nThe Fountain for all its visceral impact,\nextracts comfort. Tommy and Izzy\u2019s\nlove is incredibly real (unlike the love\ndriven by vanity that seems to imbue\nRequiem), the greatest gesture of realism Aronofsky has given us. The Tree\nof Life not only embodies the hope in\nfinding a cure for Izzy but it begins to\nsymbolise in his eternal soul Izzy her-self, who gives him not only hope but\nlife also.\nIn the end, in both Izzy\u2019s book and the\neternal soul, Tommy is reborn within\nIzzy, not resolving the film but merely\nbeatifying it. Like I said, for all Aronofsky\u2019s unrelenting realism, sometimes\nreality is just too real to extract beauty\nfrom, and like many a Romantic before\nhim, he has dug deeper.\nAlex Casey\nFilm Editor\nWednesday night saw the second annual FilmSoc Short Film Festival take\nplace in the Union Concert Hall which\nsaw 8 very different films from budding\nstudent directors take centre stage. On\nentering I must admit that I was a bit\ndubious about what to expect and,\nwith the winning prize being a 2 day\ncourse in introductory direction run by\nRaindance, a bit envious too perhaps,\nyet must concede that, despite a couple of disappointing technical hitches,\nI came away feeling very entertained\nand impressed.\nHaving heard word of the high\nstandard set by last year\u2019s inaugural\nevent but not having seen it for my-self, I wasn\u2019t really sure what to expect,\nand the correct response to this in\nhindsight would have to be that there\nisn\u2019t a typical entry. The eight couldn\u2019t\nhave been more different; from a geometric claymation shape-off to a potential murder mystery, or a Nietzche\ninspired tale of fate to a Biblical breakfast plague. This certainly wasn\u2019t just\nanother Romeo & Juliet adaptation cut\ndown and rehashed in 7 minutes, but\na great breadth of directorial skills in\na developing infancy that did a lot to\ninspire admiration of the filmmaking\nprocess.\nPerhaps the best technically, in my\nopinion, was Shadowman, a 4 minute\npiece by Hardy D. Saleh about a teacher leaving school but with the foreboding impression of someone following\nVictoria Sanderson, FilmSoc President, joined by the winners and judge, Oli Harbottle (far left)\nhim. The pacing of this was certainly\nhandled in a way that belied its amateur credentials with great employment of music and camera positioning\nto create an effect taken for granted in\nso many feature films.\nIn terms of narrative storytelling abil-ity, I\u2019d give it to David Looney\u2019s Faith In\nThe Eight which opened on Nietzche\u2019s\nquote: \u201cGod is dead\u201d. Instead of God\u2019s\ndetermination, the characters at various points use a Magic 8 ball to determine the course their lives will take,\nsimilar to the methodology of Luke\nRhinehart\u2019s The Dice Man novel, and\nat various points the ball must make its\nway from one owner to the next, a situation easily mishandled, especially in\nthe early days of silent cinema.\nOn the humour side of the scales,\nI would have to admit that, despite\nnot warming to it at the start, I was\ncharmed by Soumen Sen and Sophia\nPaget\u2019s Bready and Milk in the Carnage\nof the Croissants by the time it had got\ninto its 13 minute stride. Whilst the\nscene length seemed to be at points\ndecided by how long the score of popular songs were without editing, the\ntale of the rampaging four croissants\nof the apocalypse and the resistance of\nBready and Milky, two unlikely super-heroes, was more than enough to raise\na chuckle. Is it all a metaphor for the\nBritish staple diet getting bogged down\namongst foreign delicacies? Who cares,\nit was worth a good giggle.\nThe almost Lynchian beginning of\nAlistair Turnbull\u2019s entry, Three in the\nHand is also worth of note amongst\nthe competition for its splendid spook-iness, although I\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t go\ndown the road of the unspoken love\nbetween a man and his spade as I had\nstrangely envisioned from the opening\nminute or so.\nThe winner, however, was none of\nthese but a short about the horrors of\nwar, Pourquoi N\u00e9cessite Notre Cri de\nCirque? (Why Must Our Circus Cry?),\nby Sushil Kumar. As much as I would\nhave liked to have disagreed with the\nwinner for no other reason than to\nadd praise to another of the worthy\ncandidates, I am glad this won. With\nits interesting use of photo montage\nto begin, apparent archive war footage and almost subliminal insertion\nof a still frame depicting a woman sat\nreading under a tree at the beginning\nof each act, it was the avant-garde of\nthe bunch.

This amount though does not include water loss from sweating during\nexercise so you will need to take into\naccount this loss and add it on to your\ndaily requirement.\nAlong with plenty of bed rest and\ngood hydration levels examine what\nyou are eating. Take a look at Holly\u2019s\narticle for ideas on pre-match nutri-tion. Finally avoid too much alcohol\nconsumption over the next few days.\nIdeally cut out all alcohol completely,\nthough I realise this may be hard for\nsome of you!\nOn The Day\nAim to get up around 7.00am so\nthat you have plenty of time to prepare yourself for the day\u2019s big match.\nHopefully you would have had a great\nnight\u2019s sleep having got to bed before\n10.30pm.\nStart the day with a big breakfast.\nThis is one of the times where having\na cooked breakfast will be beneficial to\nyou as you will need a lot of calories for\nthe day ahead. Some of you may find\nthat you have quite a lot of nerves or\nexcitable energy and so it is a good idea\nto eat throughout the day to keep energy levels up. Also it is often a good\nidea to eat more in the morning as you\nmay find that as the match gets closer\nnerves suppress your appetite. There\nis nothing worse than trying to force\nfood down when you are not hungry\nwhen you need some extra energy.\nAgain focus on your hydration levels\nand keep sipping water throughout the\nday. If you do decide to perform the\nmobility session in the morning make\nsure it is early enough to give yourself\nplenty of time to eat again and rest for\nthe match. Finally, remember to give\nyourself a good hour before the start\nof the match to warm up. A quick five\nminute jog is not the best way to get\nyou prepared to compete at your optimal performance level.\n47\nfelix\nFriday 22 February 2008\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Sport\nPreparing for Varsity: the\nsportsman\u2019s itinerary\nAndy Mitchell\nEnergia Fitness Instructor\nSports league\nThe biggest sporting event at Imperial\nis upon us again. It\u2019s time for the Imperial teams to face up to the Medics and\nsee who comes out on top. With five\ndays to go, all of you taking part have\nhopefully already been preparing your-selves. If you haven\u2019t do not panic there\nis still lots you can do over the next few\ndays to get ready.\nBuilding up to Varsity\nTo fully benefit from all of the training\nsessions over the last few weeks your\nbody will need more than just a good\ndays rest on Tuesday prior to the next\nday\u2019s games. Over the next five days\nensure you consider the following tips\nto reach Wednesdays match in optimal\nphysical shape.\nTapering training sessions:\nPrior to any big match or sporting\ncompetition you want to be reducing\nyour volume of training. This is what\nwe call tapering your sessions. If you\nhaven\u2019t been tapering your training\nsessions already then start right away.\nThe idea of tapering is to allow your\nbody plenty of rest to recover from any\ntraining prior to the big match but still\nkeep it at its optimal fitness levels. The\nvolume of the sessions should be low\nbut the quality high, focusing on the\nspeed of movements. Any heavy resistance workouts or long aerobic sessions\nshould have been done and dusted a\ncouple of weeks ago.\nIf you have been training hard all\nweek I suggest you take the whole\nweekend off and have a light training\nsession on Monday. Follow this with a\nmobility session on Tuesday, and then\nagain on Wednesday morning prior to\nyour match (allow at least 4-5 hours\nrest between this session and commencing your warm-up). The idea of\nthese sessions is to keep the muscles\nloose and the nervous system ready for\nthe physical activity ahead. An hour\nsession focusing on low intensity footwork and hand/eye coordination drills\nfollowed by gentle mobility exercises is\nperfect.\nRest and Recovery:\nYou want to be ensuring that you have\nplenty of rest over the coming days to\nrecharge your batteries and help heal\nany niggling injuries you may have. As\nI have mentioned in a previous article the optimal time for your body to\nrepair itself physically is from 1.00am\nto 3.00am. To gain the most from this\nwindow you need to be in a deep sleep\nand to do this will take 2-3 hours.\nTherefore aim to be in bed by 10.30pm\nat the latest. I realise this may create\nproblems with your social lives for a\nfew days but you\u2019ll be surprised with\nhow good you feel and how well rested\nyou are when you wake up!\nAlong with plenty of rest ensure that\nyou are drinking plenty of water. Remember a 1% drop in hydration levels equals a 10% drop in performance!\nOver the coming days really focus on\nthe amount of water you are consum-ing. Aim for your body weight in kg\nTeam P W D L F A Diff % FI\n1 IC Squash Men's 1st 12 12 0 0 60 0 60 100 60\n2 IC Rugby Union Men's 1st 14 12 0 2 384 128 256 86 52\n3 IC Netball 1st 12 11 0 1 559 327 232 92 51\n4 IC Tennis Men's 2nd 11 10 0 1 84 26 58 91 46\n5 IC Tennis Women's 1st 11 9 1 1 76 33 43 82 43\n6 IC Volleyball Women's 1st 8 8 0 0 23 7 16 100 40\n7 IC Hockey Men's 1st 12 9 1 2 41 22 19 75 39\n8 IC Fencing Women's 1st 9 8 0 1 1183 893 290 89 36\n9 ICSM Netball 2nd 9 7 0 2 289 160 129 78 27\n10 IC Rugby Union Men's 2nd 12 7 2 3 278 176 102 58 27\n11 IC Football Men's 1st 10 4 5 1 17 7 10 40 26\n12 IC Squash Men's 2nd 10 7 0 3 30 19 11 70 23\n13 IC Football Women's 1st 8 4 3 1 11 7 4 50 22\n14 IC Fencing Men's 2nd 6 5 0 1 761 660 101 83 21\n15 ICSM Hockey Women's 1st 10 6 1 3 54 20 34 60 20\n16 IC Waterpolo Men's 1st 3 3 0 0 31 10 21 100 15\n17 IC Volleyball Men's 1st 10 6 0 4 12 9 3 60 14\n18 ICSM Hockey Men's 2nd 10 6 0 4 28 24 4 60 14\n19 ICSM Football Men's 1st 8 3 3 2 13 12 1 38 13\n20 ICSM Badminton Women's 1st 6 4 0 2 31 17 14 67 12\n21 IC Squash Men's 3rd 6 4 0 2 8 4 4 67 12\n22 IC Table Tennis Women's 1st 6 4 0 2 17 11 6 67 12\n23 ICSM Netball 1st 10 5 1 4 334 354 -20 50 11\n24 IC Hockey Men's 2nd 10 5 1 4 50 23 27 50 11\n25 IC Hockey Men's 3rd 10 5 1 4 18 17 1 50 11\n26 IC Squash Women's 1st 10 5 1 4 12 16 -4 50 11\n27 IC Badminton Men's 1st 11 6 0 5 48 40 8 55 10\n28 IC Lacrosse Women's 1st 9 5 0 4 79 67 12 56 9\n29 IC Netball 2nd 9 5 0 4 277 209 68 56 9\n30 IC Table Tennis Men's 1st 9 5 0 4 91 62 29 56 9\n31 IC Hockey Women's 1st 10 4 2 4 35 32 3 40 8\n32 IC Basketball Men's 1st 5 3 0 2 319 313 6 60 7\n33 ICSM Hockey Women's 2nd 10 3 3 4 30 42 -12 30 5\n34 ICSM Hockey Men's 3rd 5 2 1 2 18 9 9 40 4\n35 IC Rugby Union Women's 1st 4 2 0 2 89 57 32 50 2\n36 IC Badminton Men's 2nd 10 4 1 5 37 43 -6 40 2\n37 ICSM Hockey Men's 1st 10 4 1 5 22 35 -13 40 2\n38 ICSM Rugby Union Men's 3rd 11 5 0 6 267 228 39 45 1\n39 IC Fencing Men's 1st 7 3 0 4 817 798 19 43 -1\n40 IC Hockey Women's 2nd 10 3 2 5 13 39 -26 30 -1\n41 IC Rugby Union Men's 3rd 12 5 0 7 184 176 8 42 -3\n42 ICSM Rugby Union Men's 1st 12 5 0 7 199 292 -93 42 -3\n43 ICSM Hockey Women's 3rd 10 4 0 6 18 24 -6 40 -4\n44 IC Hockey Men's 4th 9 3 0 6 13 22 -9 33 -9\n45 ICSM Netball 3rd 9 3 0 6 178 223 -45 33 -9\n46 ICSM Football Men's 2nd 5 0 1 4 9 17 -8 0 -14\n47 IC Tennis Men's 1st 10 2 1 7 36 64 -28 20 -16\n48 ICSM Badminton Men's 1st 10 2 1 7 29 51 -22 20 -16\n49 ICSM Rugby Men's 2nd 14 4 0 10 222 382 -160 29 -20\n50 IC Badminton Women's 1st 9 1 1 7 25 47 -22 11 -21\n51 IC Football Men's 3rd 10 1 1 8 14 35 -21 10 -25\n52 IC Football Men's 2nd 10 0 1 9 11 35 -24 0 -34\nACROSS\n1 A section of a British farm (6)\n4 Ever abed, he decomposed and was\nmourned (8)\n10 Punished; no sex for Edward (9)\n11 Baby\u2019s need for drink is all-important (5)\n12 Luxurious, decadent West (3)\n13 Expansion of an unusual cult (11)\n14 Assess the journal (6)\n16 Robbery in the isthmus of Panama\n(5)\n19 Implied historian\u2019s head (5)\n20 A sanction on a Greek city-dweller\n(6)\n22 Nine battles of a degenerate sport\n(5,6)\n25 Destroy the heart of Denmark (3)\n26 Innocent spillage of water (5)\n27 Heartless teen tells depraved\nstories (9)\n28 Strangle at top speed (8)\n29 Fires around Nathaniel as he grabs\nsomething to eat (6)\nThe winner of last week\u2019s crossword\nwas team DAPPAU.

The energy of solar\nirradiation incident upon the earth in one hour is equivalent to\nthe world\u2019s entire annual energy consumption at present. For\nthis reason, solar photovoltaic, the direct conversion of sunlight\nto electricity, is expected to play a significant role in future\nelectricity supply.\u201d\n\u2013 Dr Saif Haque, Department of Chemistry\nFuel Cells\n\u201cFuel cells allow efficient conversion of chemical to electrical\nenergy. In doing so we hope to produce efficient, inexpensive\nand stable catalysts, and to develop ionic conductors which\nfunction efficiently over a wide range of operating conditions.\nGetting a fuel cell to work well is all about adjusting the\nchemical, electrical and physical properties of multiple\nmaterials so that they all function in harmony \u201d\n\u2013 Dr Anthony Kucernak, Department of Chemistry\nFuel Cells\n\u201cFuel cells offer the potential for high efficiency and low\nemissions. However, engineering the right microstructures in the\ncomponent layers, manufacturing them repeatably and making\nthem cost-competitive requires an enormous range of skills. Fuel\ncell components frequently have to perform many functions\nsimultaneously and finding the best compromise can only be\ndone by working in a multi-disciplinary team.\u201d\n\u2013 Dr David Hart, Center for Environmental Policy\nWind & Tidal Turbines\n\u201cThe increasing size and flexibility of the latest wind turbines\nand the need for offshore deployment have increased the critical\nimportance of predicting blade dynamics accurately. Projects\nin the Aero department are investigating unsteady blade load\ncontrol by rapid-acting flaps, interaction between blades and the\ntower and the effect of upstream wakes in a wind farm impinging\ndownstream rotors.\u201d\n\u2013 Prof J Michael Graham, Department of Aeronautics\nBiomass Derived Fuel\n\u201cThe problem is to make fuel from plants in ways that are\nsustainable and to do this we are looking at low-energy,\nlow-carbon ways of converting plant cell walls into\nalcohols and oils. Doing this will reduce land requirements,\nagricultural inputs and the costs of processing plant\nmaterial into fuel.\u201d\n\u2013 Prof Richard Templer, Porter Alliance, Hoffmann Chair in\nChemistry\nSolar Energy\n\u201cAchieving efficient solar energy conversion places very\ntight constraints on the properties of the materials which are\nemployed. Employing molecular materials allows us to exploit\nthe power of synthetic chemistry to prepare molecules with\na vast range of functionalities. The challenge is knowing what\nproperties are key for efficient solar cells, and then to integrate\nthese molecules into practical, low cost and stable devices!\u201d\n\u2013 Prof James Durrant, Department of Chemistry\n8\n\n"

Public\nawareness of the need to provide our\nchildren with a decent place to live in\nhas heaped much responsibility on the\nbacks of politicians and policy-makers.\nAs public concern for the environment\ncontinues to grow worldwide, priorities\nin political agendas are set to change.\nIn this battle against environmental\ndamage and climate change, civil and\nenvironmental engineers are among\nthe most valuable conscripts, equipped\nwith the technical knowledge and skills\nneeded to overcome challenging obstacles and achieve tangible results.\nThe job of the civil and, in particular,\nthe environmental engineer is to apply\nscience and engineering principles to\nimprove the quality of air, water and\nland. Environmental engineering involves not only water and air pollution\ncontrol, recycling, waste disposal and\npublic health issues, but also a knowledge of environmental engineering law\nas well as studies on the environmental impact of proposed construction\nprojects.\nCivil and environmental engineers\nalso design and construct energy-efficient buildings, reducing their dependence on mechanical heating and\ncooling, with their associated carbon\nemissions and health implications. Finally, these engineers are also responsible for studying and proposing transport policies and traffic management\nmeasures on land, water and in the air\nto reduce the impact of vehicles on the\nenvironment.\nImperial\u2019s civil and environmental\nengineers are \u201cnot soldiers, but elite\ntroops\u201d, Professor Julian Bommer senior lecturer in Engineering Seismology at Imperial\u2019s Department of Civil\nand Environmental Engineering states\nproudly. Indeed, this prestigious department plays a leading role in both\nnational and international research activities relating to the environment and\nalso provides advice and guidance to\nUK and overseas governments as well\nas international agencies.\nEnvironmental and Water Resource Engineering (EWRE) at\nImperial\nThe department is home to the Environmental and Water Resource Engineering Section, or EWRE, the largest\nand one of the most active sections\nin the department. Together with the\nCentre for Environmental Control and\nWaste Management, it forms one of the\npremiere, multi-disciplined environmental groups in the UK and world-wide. \u201cEWRE has a large and diverse\nportfolio of research activities and\nconsults widely in the UK and overseas\u201d, notes Howard Wheater, Head\nof the EWRE Section and Professor of\nHydrology. \u201cTo help our understand-ing, we can think of the environment\nas being broken up into three main\nbranches\u201d explains Professor Wheater.\nThe first branch, environmental sci-ence, concentrates on the natural environment and studies the impacts of\nhuman activity on ecosystems. Environmental engineering, the second\nbranch, focuses on applying science\nand engineering principles to improve\nthe quality of air, water and land while\nthe third, engineering and the envi-ronment, is the meeting point of the\nfirst two and concentrates on sustainability and other topical issues such as\nlow-carbon footprint and the \u201csmart\nhouse\u201d. The 10 full-time members of\nstaff, some 20 research assistants and\n25 full-time post-graduate research\nstudents at EWRE are involved in all\nthree branches and their work is as\nvaried as the environment itself. Current and recent projects have been undertaken not only in the UK, but also\nin countries as far afield as Botswana\nand Mauritius, amongst many others.\nKeen to find out more, I went along\none late Friday afternoon, and in an\ninformal and relaxed interview, asked\nProfessor Wheater, a past president\nof the British Hydrological Society, to\ngive me an overview of some of the\nwork that members of EWRE have recently been involved with.\nOrganic and inorganic waste\nDrs Chris Cheeseman and Stephen\nSmith are working in the areas of inorganic and organic waste respec-tively. In particular, Dr Cheeseman\u2019s\nresearch aims at converting inorganic\nwaste (such as the waste produced by\nPart of a Falaj system in Oman \u2013 an ancient system that taps in to shallow groundwater and feeds it to the\nsurface. Some aflaj are more than 1500 years old; as a whole they've been deemed a World Heritage Site\nconstruction materials) into something useful, as well as developing CO2\n\u2013capturing cement technology. This\nwill provide a significant step towards\ntackling the adverse environmental\nimpacts of cement \u00ac the cement industry currently produces about 5%\nof global man-made CO2 emissions.\nAt the other end, Dr Smith\u2019s research\nfocuses on sewage sludge disposal and\nrecycling. He has also recently been\ninvolved in an EU-funded project in\nCyprus to generate energy from waste.\nHis experiences from this project were\nshared with undergraduates, forming\nthe basis of a Group Design Project in\n2006.\nWaste management\nProfessor Sue Grimes, the first woman\nto be appointed to a chair sponsored\nby the Royal Academy of Engineering, is also the College\u2019s first professor\nin Waste Management. Together with\nher research group, Professor Grimes\nhas been involved in a wide range of\nprojects in waste management involving the electronics, secondary metals\nand waste industries, as well as the Environment Agency and Local Authorities. She has also carried out research\nleading to the development of clean\nprocess technology for selective metal\nrecovery from waste streams, material\nrecovery from composites, methodologies for the analysis of toxic pollutants\nin wastes, and diverting waste from\nlandfill, to name but a few.\nWater and Wastewater\nEngineering\nProfessor Nigel Graham and Dr\nMichael Templeton work in the field\nof water and wastewater treatment\nand have participated in a wide range\nof projects both in developed and developing countries. Professor Graham\nhas been working on developing water\ntreatment plants using local and imported materials to provide safe, clean\ndrinking water to refugee camps, while\nDr Templeton has been asked to conduct research in water and sanitation\nmanagement for Nepal. \u201cWe also enjoy\ndoing things on the hi-tech end\u201d adds\nProfessor Wheater. Professor Graham\nis developing a \u2018smart-sensor\u2019 system\nwhich is able to detect leaks in water\nand wastewater distribution networks,\nwhile Dr Templeton is also involved\nwith computational modeling of treatment processes. Professor Cedo Maksimovic, chief advisor to UNESCO\u2019s\nInternationalHydrologicalProgramme\nVI on urban water management, has a\nbroad research interest in the field of\nurban flooding and is currently developing LIDAR technology to digitally\nmap areas contributing to major urban\nfloods. Meanwhile Dr Adrian Butler, is\nthe principal investigator on an EPSRC\nfunded project modeling contaminant\ntransport processes in landfill waste.\nIn a recent project, Dr Butler used historical data from the 1840s to simulate\nflood events from the river Lament\nin Chichester and showed that existing climate models are still poor in\npredicting long-term changes \u2013 \u201cthe\ntrends indicated by his simulations\nhave bad implications for the future of\nSouth East England\u201d Professor Wheater adds.\nHydrology\nWheater himself certainly has no\nshortage of research activities and\nprojects in his portfolio. With his special interest in the hydrology of arid\nareas, he describes his work as scientific advisor in a water resources study\nin Saudi Arabia in the late 1990s aimed\nat improving the management of flash\nfloods. He now provides technical support to governments and organizations\nthrough UNESCO\u2019s programme on\nhydrology. In recognition of his work\non water resources in arid areas, Professor Wheater was invited in 2006 to a\nbanquet in Riyadh, to receive the prestigious Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz\nInternational Water Prize, which now\n\u201cBy improving\nenergy efficiency,\nCO2\nemissions\nfrom buildings\ncan be reduced\nby up to 20%\u201d\nWhat a waste:wastewater treatment in Pleasant Grove, USA. I suppose the pleasant groves are at top right\n\n"

Yes, I mean\nall three of you. I know you have sorely\nmissed not only this column, but also\nthe more often than not disgracefully\nwritten articles. I will make a pact with\nyou: from this week onwards, there will\nbe enough Business in Felix to make\nyou ill from the second you wake up to\nthe moment you lie down to sleep in\nyour unchanged sheets.\nI shall not plague you much today.\nActually, this is a lie. I will plague you\nbucketloads \u2013 if you are a damned\nhippy, that is. One of those who make\nit a life-long goal to hate every mildly\nsuccessful businessman or every single\nmultinational corporation known to\nman, be their headquarters in Mexifornia or somewhere in Albion. I have\na problem with people who think and\nfeel this way because it is fashionable to\nmake a bold statement. The amount of\nfilth they speak is directly proportional\nto that hanging from their disgusting\ndreadlocks. Their hatred of anything\nthat does not involve copious quantities of acid or extra-marital group\nsexual intercourse or a combination of\nboth is sickening.\nAmong these people, there is a\nsomewhat schadenfreudistic mentality regarding entrepreneurs and the\n\u00fcber wealthy. This does not seem to\nbe limited to Birkenstock-wearing,\ntree-hugging idiots, though. It is almost as if this frame of mind plagues\nthe majority of the population in the\nUK. People seem to enjoy it and take\npleasure when others fail. There is the\nautomatic assumption that if someone\nhas the cojones to try something completely new and revolutionary, they are\nautomatically arrogant. This an unbelievably preposterous train of thought.\nWhat these people fail to see is that it\ntakes a lot to become a wildly successful entrepreneur. Any man or woman\nwho has managed to create something,\nbe it a product or service, from scratch\ndeserves all the praise in the world. I\nhave the utmost respect for those who\nhave come from nothing and built empires from nothing and those who are\nable to successfully continue running\nthose passed on to them.\nRelatively poor shows like Dragon\u2019s\nDen seem to have actually helped this\nsituation, albeit in a slightly demeaning fashion. They have spawned many\na wannabe inventor/entrepreneur, but\nforgot to educate on the responsibility\nthat comes with trying to reach their\ngoal. They fail to comment on the very\nreal risk some of these people face of\nlosing their careers, money, and sometimes family.\nEntrepreneurs push known boundaries and debunk widely spread myths\nabout risk and reward. Learn how to\nlove Richistan. Learn how to learn\nfrom it. Most importantly, learn how\nto transform the energy you spend being envious, into building and creating\nsomething real.\nT\nhis summer, I spent a\nmonth in Beijing. Despite\nbeing a pretty frequent\nvisitor to the city, each\ntrip back is still an exciting\nexperience; that same taxi ride, taking\nme from Beijing International Airport\nto my apartment, has looked so different every time. Where before I recall\nonly an empty patch of land, or scaffolds just bursting upwards from their\nfoundations, now stands a park, some\npublic amenity, or, more often than\nnot, a gleaming new tower bustling\nwith people.\nThese \u201covernight skyscrapers\u201d have\nbecome a symbol of China\u2019s seemingly\nunstoppable development. With GDP\ngrowth reported at 11.4% for 2007,\nhaving been cruising close to this figure for around a decade now, and a\nspectacular US trade surplus of $232.5\nbillion in 2006, it is little wonder then\nthat the global community have\ntheir eyes firmly fixed on China. The country is acutely\naware of its nouveau\nriche status, still not\nyet fully accepted by\nits western peers.\nIt undoubtedly possesses economic clout,\nbut there are too many\nskeletons in its closet. The\nfavourites of activists across\nthe globe include the Tiananmen Square massacre, the oppression of Tibet, censorship of\nthe press, and more recently the\nalleged support of the Sudanese government in Darfur; the list goes on.\nHence China\u2019s eagerness to dazzle\nat the 2008 Olympics. It hopes to draw\nthe world\u2019s attention away from such\ntroubling issues whilst at the same\ntime showcasing its economic power.\nTo gain the Olympic bid, Beijing had\npromised $20 billion towards developing infrastructure alone, over five\ntimes the amount spent by Athens in\n2004. This accounts for only half of the\n$40 billion estimated Olympic related\nspending which includes a brand new\nairport terminal, drastic expansions\nto the city\u2019s tube network, new road\nlinks, and targets to drastically reduce\npollution and improve air quality. Essentially the city is undergoing a drastic facelift in a bid to transform Beijing\ninto a modern capital to rival those\nfound in the west.\nWith the Olympics less than a year\naway, cranes and scaffolding still dot\nthe skyline, roads are dug up throughout the city, and the sound of machinery fills the smog-laden air. In any\nother country the situation would have\nlooked desperate, but in China everything is right on schedule. When it\ncomes to ambitious projects, China\u2019s\ntrack record is impressive. The $22 billion Three Gorges dam was finished\nnine months early and the $3.2 billion Qinghai\u2013Tibet railway completed\nalmost three years ahead. This is because manpower is one thing China is\ndefinitely not short of.\nWith lax laws on\nworking\nhours and a\nveritable army of over\n120 million migrant workers\ndrafted from the countryside, the pace\ncan be stepped up to incredible levels.\nThese cheap sources of unskilled labour are the less than glamorous, yet\nvital, underbelly to the Chinese economic juggernaut. They are willing to\nlive in basic temporary accommoda-tion, often far from their families, and\nwork continuously on 24-hour shifts\nwith no weekend breaks. The jobs are\ndangerous and deaths are often swept\nunder the carpet. But for many this is\njust a fact of life. Heavily reminiscent\nof the days of the industrial revolution,\nonly 13% of workers are part of a trade\nunion and even then they have little\nvoice. If they are not prepared to work\nto support their families, there are\nplenty waiting in line to replace them.\nAt the othr end of the spectrum,\nhowever, are those who have\nflourished under China\u2019s\nburgeoning economy. As\ndisposable incomes rise\nthere is now a significant\nnumber who follow the latest fashions and shop at\ndesigner outlets, looking\nand acting every bit like\ntheir western\ncounterparts. Although\nit is true that China\u2019s wealth\nhas translated into a general improved standard of living, with an\nincreasing number of families now\nable to afford common household\nappliances like washing machines\nand refrigerators, some have definitely felt the benefits more than\nothers. The urban-rural divide remains\nprominent and it is primarily the city\ndwellers that are enjoying the luxuries\nassociated with rising GDP. The middle\nclasses, defined by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences as having assets\nvalued between 150,000 and 300,000\nDaniel Wang Yuan (around $18,000 to $36,000), now\ncompose 49% of the urban population\nwhilst only accounting for 19% of the\npopulation overall.\nIt is unsurprising then that, in a\ncountry with such social inequality,\nthe government\u2019s lavish spending on\nthe Olympics has received criticism.\nThey argue the money could have been\nbetter spent on healthcare, the welfare\nsystem or education programs rather\nthan on flashy showpieces which will\nonly benefit the privileged few.\nAmazingly, breeding a class of elite\ncitizens, albeit temporarily, is exactly\nwhat China wants; as expressed in the\nsentiments of former CCP leader Deng\nXiaoping, China is \u201cletting some get\nrich first\u201d. While ethically debatable,\nthere is good reason, at least economi-cally, for China to advocate a two-tier\nsystem. The premise is to heavily concentrate resources on a select few,\nhence the disproportionate amount\nof urban spending, helping them rapidly gain affluence so that they can establish a foothold in the competitive\nglobal market. Once accomplished, it\nis hoped this empowered minority,\nusing their significant purchasing\npower, will then be able to pull up\nthe rest of the population, ultimately\nbenefiting the country as a whole.\nSuch a grandiose plan is fraught\nwith the risk of social instability\nand requires a tight rein, central or-ganization, and extensive long term\nplanning \u2013 something that is only\npossible in a single-party state like\nChina, free from the need to pander to voters.\nThe idiom \u201cbusiness is business\u201d\nis well known, but China\u2019s conduct\nis certainly pushing at its bounda-ries. China\u2019s willingness to distill\nmorality away from its economic\nactivities is frightening, but when\nit comes down to it, without this\nruthlessness it would not be such\na well-oiled machine.\nOne thing is for certain: springing up alongside the gleaming\nnew cities is a huge market waiting to be tapped. This is the sweet\ncoating that makes China\u2019s shortcomings such an easy pill to swallow. When\nthere are such profits to be gained,\neven the most civilized of nations find\nit hard not to occasionally look the\nother way.\nChina\u2019s cranes propagate across the smoggy horizon like wild mushrooms\n21\nFriday 22 February 2008 felix\n\n"

Yes,\nI am name-dropping to some\nsmall extent. And no, it doesn\u2019t happen often. But she did remind me of\na central point in all political theory.\nThat is, politics is about power. News\nis what happens when people gain,\nlose and use their power. The best\nmeasure of this is who has lost and\nwho has won. The actions in between\naren\u2019t too important, and politics is\ncertainly not about ideology.\nAllow me to elaborate. The elections in Pakistan this week were\ngenerally regarded as \u2018free and fair\u2019 by\nthe international community. Who\nlost? General Musharraf alongside\nthe USA. Who won? Military leaders\nhiding in the foothills of Afghanistan.\nThe US has invested a lot in building\nrelations with the country on the door\nstep of what it terms as \u2018extremism\u2019,\nbut made the mistake of aligning itself\ntoo closely with one individual.\nThe attempt to keep him in power\nby sending Benazir Bhutto back after\nyears of exile to share power after\nlegitimising elections, preventing less\nreliable (with regards to military coop-eration) candidates from abusing the\npolitical turmoil after the purging of\nprominent judicial figures, backfired\nspectacularly after her assassination.\nThe USA invaded Iraq in 2003.\nWho won? Energy companies. Who\nlost? Well, the rest of the world. Oil\ncompanies, such as Shell, have posted\nrecord profits this year owing to the\nhigh price of crude. Despite all of the\nsafeguards that the democratic system\nof government was supposed to per-form, the military might of the world\u2019s\nforemost superpower was put to use\nfor the benefits of a small number of\nthe powerful. The American economy\nmay see reward in the long term, but\ntoday, it is only the so-called hawks\nwho have seen proverbial green.\nMyanmar has one of the most\ndespotic governments in the world. Its\nuse of force against its own population\nto keep power has been in the news\nfor several months now. Similarly,\nin the Sudan, thousands are dying\nbecause of internal violence. The\nquestion is, again, who would win and\nwho would lose in the case of regime\nchange? In both cases, China stands\nto lose, as it is a significant investor\nand customer for energy resources.\nWhat is commonly referred to as the\nwestern alliance is, and have been\nrelatively effectively, using human\nrights to further individualistic\nagendas. However, neither Myanmar\nnor the Sudan could claim the crown\nof \u2018worst country in the world\u2019; that\nall-so-highly-sought-after accolade.\nYet it is they who are the focus of\ninternational organisations such as the\nUnited Nations.\nWhat is the lesson to take away\nfrom all of this? Firstly, know whose\nside you\u2019re on. Secondly, make sure\nyou\u2019re on the winning team.\nFidel Castro resigns\nFidel Castro steps down as Cuban leader after almost 50 years as President\nThe 81 year old Cuban President announced he would not \u201caccept the\npost of President\u201d if elected by the\nNational Assembly when it convenes\non 24th February. Fidel Castro, who\nhas ruled Cuba since the revolution in\n1959, made the announcement in an\nopen letter entitled \u201cMessage from the\nCommander in Chief\u201d published on\nthe website of the Cuban Communist\nParty\u2019s newspaper Granma. Released\nin the middle of Monday night, it states\nthat the leader does not \u201caspire\u201d to be\nthe next President of the Council of\nState and Commander in Chief. Cuban\nexiles in Miami celebrated but there\nwere no such demonstrations in Cuba\nitself.\nCubans recently elected a parlia-ment, due to meet for the first time this\ncoming Sunday. One of the duties of\nthis parliament is to elect a new Executive Council of State, the president of\nwhich will become the new President\nof Cuba for the next five-year term.\nSince July 2006, Fidel\u2019s younger brother Raul has been temporarily running\nthe country; Fidel Castro underwent\nemergency intestinal surgery and has\nnot been seen in public since, though\nvideos of the leader have been re-leased. So far, this transition has been\nsmooth with little outward change.\nRaul Castro has kept the military loyal\nwhilst weeding out corrupt officials to\nkeep the people\u2019s trust. However, in a\nkeynote speech last year, Raul Castro\nannounced that \u201cstructural and conceptual\u201d changes were needed to help\nsave the collapsing economy. This has\nled to increased speculation of major\neconomic changes to come, possibly a\nmove away from the Communism seen\nin practice there today and towards a\nmarket-oriented economy. The Cuban\neconomy has been in decline since the\nUSSR collapsed at the end of the 1980s.\nThe continued support from Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in the form\nof millions of barrels of cheap oil has\nhelped prevent the economy from collapsing sooner. This situation is not going to be helped by the departure from\noffice of Fidel Castro, the last of the\ngreat Cold War leaders. The last thing\nCuba needs is division and a power\nstruggle for the leadership. However,\nmost Cubans, despite being saddened\nby the news, appear optimistic and\nJames Goldsack\nhopeful for the future.\nThe resignation of Fidel Castro did\nnot come as a complete shock to analysts as Mr. Castro\u2019s illness has been\nwell documented. Despite the details\nof this being kept a state secret, it is\nbelieved to be diverticulitis, an inflammation of the colon. In recent Cuban\nnewspaper articles, the Cuban leader\nhinted that he may soon retire. Defending himself from claims he should\nhave stepped down earlier, Mr. Castro\nsaid he had a duty to the Cuban people\nto prepare for his absence. However,\ntalking about his current situation, he\nadded \u201cIt would betray my conscience\nto take up a responsibility that requires\nmobility and total devotion that I am\nnot in a physical condition to offer\u201d.\nDespite retiring from the Presidency,\nFidel Castro will not give up on Communism or his revolutionary spirit. \u201cI\njust want to carry on fighting like a\nsoldier of ideas\u201d, he wrote in his open\nletter to the country. Mr. Castro promised to continue writing essays entitled\nReflections of Comrade Fidel and to\nbe \u201cone more weapon in the arsenal\n[Cuba] can count on\u201d.\nThe world\u2019s longest ruling non-mon-arch head of state, Fidel Castro during his 49 years in power has helped\ntransform Cuba. Before the successful\nrevolution in 1959, the Castro brothers\nattempted to overthrow the authoritarian regime of Fulgencio Batista but\nfailed, resulting in a 22 month prison\nsentence. After leaving prison, they\nescaped to Mexico where they befriended idealist and revolutionary\nErnesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara de la Serna.\nIn 1959, they succeeded in leading a\nguerrilla campaign to overthrow the\ngovernment and Fidel took his place as\nthe President of Cuba with his brother\nRaul as Defence Minister and first vicepresident of the Council of State. Che\nGuevara went on to take many roles\nto help develop socialism within Cuba\nand the rest of the world.\nFidel Castro pursued the ideal for an\negalitarian society and the Communist\nParty members set an example to all;\nMr. Castro recently told reporters that\nhis \u201cprimary duty is not to cling to any\nposition\u201d and various members of the\ngovernment only accept the salary of\na revolutionary soldier. Under Castro,\nboth the healthcare and education systems have become world-leading and\nare both free for all \u2013 one main pinnacle of their socialist agenda. The new\ngovernment in Cuba has helped free\nthe people from an extremely oppressive authoritarian regime. However,\nmany would claim that it has been replaced by a new but similar regime. To\nan extent this is correct but in recent\nyears many political prisoners, often\ncalled \u201cprisoners of conscience\u201d, have\nbeen released, including 4 last week-Castro has visibly deteriorated due to his recent illness\nFidel Castro has been in charge of the communist state since the 60\u2019s\n\n"

It\u2019s\nThe Clocks\u2019 first release since joining\nIsland Records in 2007, so the band\nare not too well known yet, but if their\nother songs are as good as \u2018Old Valve\nRadio\u2019 then they certainly have something to offer to British music (and\ntheir debut album is likely to be very\npopular). The track is likely to get particular attention from student radio\nstations because of the huge general\nstudent obsession with the indie-pop\ngenre, which it fits into perfectly. It\nhas a great upbeat sound, lively vocals\nwith cheerful lyrics, a guitar solo and a\nvery memorable tune. These guys are\ngoing to be big, and probably in time\nto play at 2008\u2019s music festivals.

The track explodes with an\naggressive and raw nature throughout,\nwith a fizzing lead guitar adequately\ncomplimenting the vocals. The lyrics\nwill no doubt polarize listeners due to\ntheir simple nature, but suit the style of\nthe track effectively.\nThe chorus proclaims that criticism goes \u201cIn one ear, and right out\nthe other\u201d. However, on the basis of\nthis impressive and catchy single, the\nsame cannot be said about Cage the\nElephant\u2019s music.\nNat Roocroft\nVincent Vincent and the Villains\nPretty Girl\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nThis track will make good light-heart-ed listening if you like the Libertines,\nwho they bear a striking resemblance\nto. The vocals are different, which\nmakes a refreshing change, but there\nis little progression throughout the\nsong and the chorus is not especially\nmemorable.\nChris Birkett\nTurncoat\nWasted On You\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nThe Smiths, Pulp and The Beatles have\nall influenced Turncoat\u2019s records, they\nsay in their biography. Although there\nare a few nice quirks, like the backing\nvocals reiterating lyrics for obvious\nemphasis, this does essentially mean\nthat we\u2019ve heard a lot of very similar\nbands before.

The problem is that it just doesn\u2019t\nreally work as a song. The message is\nnothing new and the novelty of the\nlyrics is all this song has to offer. I\u2019m\nsure they meant it to feel repetitive and\nsterile to emphasise the point they are\ntrying to make, but it ends up sounding dull after a few listens. It lacks the\nenergy and creativity of their earlier\nsingles, such as \u2018B-54\u2019 and \u2018Darlin\u2019. Let\u2019s\nhope that when they finally get round\nto making their first album we see a\nreturn to their more promising and exciting song writing abilities.\nJames Houghton (Not ICRadio)\nNot content with simply being a highly\nsought-after producer, Mark Ronson\npresents us his interpretation of the\nclassic Radiohead hit \u2018Just\u2019, having already tackled The Smiths, The Zutons and Kaiser Chiefs on his double\nplatinum album \u2018Version\u2019.

Unfortunately\nfor them, Pete and the Pirates fit the\nmould right down to their quirkily\ndesigned T-shirts. I brace myself for\nhalf-an-hour of abrasive guitar twang-ing, predictable melodies and same-old lyrics about getting pissed up in\nsome obscure town just North of Sawbridgeworth, vocalised through half-sung, half-shouted wails, a sound only\nachievedwhenone\u2019stootightjeanshave\nrestricted a healthy blood flow to the\ndiaphragm.

To draw comparisons with something less obscure,\nthe Pirates have a dreamy quality about\nthem reminiscent of The Shins and TV\non the Radio-esque quirky but well developed harmonies.\nA quick look at their myspace confirms they are probably Nice Chaps,\nwith a penchant for facial hair and normal jeans. So far so\u2026 okay.

The day is rounded\noff in the evening with the\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st XV rugby playing against the Imperial Medicals 1st XV for\nthe JPR Williams Cup.\nThe event has grown every\nyear, with water polo being introduced this year. Imperial have\ndominated in the football and hockey,\nwith the medicals keeping a stronghold on the rugby and netball games.\nThe rest of the matches are definitely\nup for grabs from either side, but that\u2019s\nnot to say that there might be some upsets along the way.\nFor the last two years, the JPR Williams Cup, named after John Peter Rhys\nWilliams, a former Wales and British\nLions full back, as well as St. Mary\u2019s\nOld Boy, has been decided in the\nlast 15 minutes of the game, with the\nmedicals pulling away and ending up\nthe eventual winners. This year looks\nlike it will be another epic battle; with\nImperial having an outstanding season\nand gaining promotion to the Premiership, the Medicals have had\nless luck, and have only just\nbegun to find their feet.\nThe main event promises\nto be the greatest encounter yet. Will Imperial College\nmanage to turn the tide, or\nwill the Medicals walk away\nvictorious yet again? We\u2019ll just\nhave to wait and see.\nTickets are still available to buy\non-line, however due to lack of viewing\nareas in Ethos, no spectators\ncan attend. There are three\ntypes of tickets available for\nthe outdoor events:\n\u00a310 \u2013 includes transport\nand entry from South Kensington to Harlington then\non to Richmond for the JPR\nWilliams game and then\nback to South Kensington\nagain. You will also receive free\nentry to the Union after-party. \u00a36.50\n\u2013 JPR Williams Rugby advance match\nticket only or \u00a37.50 on the door.\nLook out for the Varsity pull-out\nwhich will have a report on all the\ngames, due out on the 7th March\n2008.\nTickets are still availble and can\nbe bought on-line at http://\nwww.imperialcollegeunion.org/\nshop-home/varsity-day-2008-600/\nproduct.html\nPre-game hype: Bottle Match 2008\nVersus The Big Clash: Varsity 2008\nYou\u2019re going to need to pump iron just to watch this one. Varsity 2008 is coming: Wednesday 27th February\nThe Royal School of Mines is out for revenge after last year\u2019s defeat to the Camborne School of Mines\nFierce competition for the ball in last years Bottle Match\nClash of the titans: a scrum from last year\u2019s rugby Varsity match\nThe Bottle Match is an annual event\nbetween the Royal School\nof Mines (RSM) and the\nCamborne School of\nMines (CSM). The\nBottle Match has been\ntaking place for 106\nyears making it the\nsecond oldest varsity\nmatch in Britain!\nStudents from the\nrival schools go head\nto head in rugby\n(men\u2019s and women\u2019s),\nhockey (men\u2019s and women\u2019s),\nfootball, golf and squash.\nThe rugby match is the\nclash which wins the much\ncoveted 3ft Bass-Charrington beer bottle stolen\nin true RSM fashion by students in 1946.\nFor a decade it had lived\nbehind The Union Bar,\nhowever last year, Camborne managed to win\nit back. The game itself\nwas a dogged event,\nwith neither side really\npulling away from the other.\nCamborne took the early lead through\na try and kept it to the end of the game.\nRSM fought valiantly, but through all\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nSports Editor\ntheir efforts, they could only manage\none converted penalty. In the dying\nseconds of the match, RSM had the\nchance with another penalty to\nwin the game and hold onto the\nBottle for another year.\nHowever the wind blew\nthe ball just wide of the\nposts and for the first\ntime in 10 years, Camborne had won The\nBottle Match.\nThe determined\nMiner\u2019s travel down\nto Camborne today\nwith the ultimate\ngoal being to bring\nback the Bottle to its rightful\nplace behind The Union\nBar. Across the board, the\nRSM sides are looking for\nrevenge over CSM.\nIn true RSM style, the\nday is bound to be full of\ndrinking, banter and above\nall, intense rivalry. Hopefully the 5 hour journey will\nbe worth it, and if not,\nthen everyone is sure\nto have a great time.\nNext week, Felix Sport\nwill have a complete\nround- up of the days\u2019 events,\nand, hopefully, a picture of the victorious RSM captain with the Bottle in his\nhands.\n\n"

My dad\npicked up the phone, and I remember\nsuddenly being overcome with emo-tion. In my juvenile efforts to find ad-venture, I had got myself so wrapped\nup in a completely avoidable situation\nand now had to explain myself to my\nparents who were as of yet unaware of\nmy escapades.\nI remember thinking to myself then\nthe reason my parents were such\namazing people. Not only had they\nmade countless sacrifice for my education and upbringing but when I did\nsilly things like this and got myself into\nstupid situations, they were complete-felix@imperial.ac.uk Travel\nA large family in a pygmy village\n39\nFriday 22 February 2008 felix\nly supportive until the problem was\nsolved, leaving their valuable advice\nfor later.\nMy dad, who is perhaps the most\nvolatile person in the family after me,\nefficiently dispatched my brother to\nthe closest Western Union in Birmingham with a few hundred pounds\nto wire over while my sister and mum\nboth then had a small chat with me\nto cheer me up. Literally tens of minutes before closing time $600 in crisp\nnotes were gracefully handed over to\nme. I thought about why everything I\ndo must be such a close shave, with no\nanswer.\nCome the next morning, Kennedy\ntook my lopsided rucksack and me to\nas close to the port on motorbike as\npossible and said goodbye. He was a\ngood man who was making tremendous effort for his family. I could see\nmy parents having done the same for\nme when I used to be a kid and I didn\u2019t\nblame him for whatever had happened.\nI also said goodbye, vowing to come\nback to climb Nyiragongo one day. He\nsaid I should only come back when I\nhave a wife and children. Funny guy; it\nwas quite a sad parting.\nThinking away, I strolled to the port,\nwhere I found people to be crowding\naround rather densely. The crowd got\nthicker and thicker as I pushed my way\nclose to the lake and as the elusive boat\nfinally came into sight, so did something unexpected, my final hurdle.\nThe boat was completely full from\ntop to bottom with people literally\nhanging on to the edges, and the crowd\nI had just pushed my way through were\nother hopefuls like me looking to get\nout of Goma. To prevent any further\nentry from the unruly crowd, the port\nhad deployed armed men who were\npointing machine guns to the floor to\nstop any unwanted incursion. Without\nKennedy, and not being able to speak\nFrench or Swahili, I found myself in\nthis final pickle of a situation.\nI had the bright idea of trying to capture this scene on camera and as I got\nmy D70s out, one guard\u2019s eyes caught\nmine and as he raised his gun and\nshouted, it became pretty clear that\nphotography was not allowed.\nI needed to be on that boat, but so\ndid all of the others around me. After\nabout a minute of analysis I had the\ninspiration to use the single language\neveryone understands \u2013 the dollar.\nI thought about what a reasonable\namount would be and as a result produced with $15.\nI pushed with all my might to the\nfront of the line and literally waved the\nwad of notes at the gunmen and the\nofficials running the service. At this\nlate point it occurred to me what they\ncould have done to a powerless individual like me to get a hold of the rest\nof my cash and belongings, but over\nyears of travel I have realised that people in foreign countries are not as bad\nas movies will have you believe.\nThe green notes caught a few eyes\nand instantly I was escorted past the\ncrowd and the gunmen to the entrance\noverly problematic but Kennedy went\non to insist that I pay him for the Gorilla trip there and then, as the recent\ninstability meant the he needed the\ncash for himself and his family.\nThis now became problematic because if I paid him I would be left with\nno more then $7 in my pocket at such\na vulnerable time. It was probably the\nmost uncomfortable situation I have\never been in.\nAt times of such crises I tend to solve\nproblems in the short term hoping for\nlonger term success so I essentially\nshot myself in the foot and paid him.\nHe promised me that he would try and\nhelp me get on that boat tomorrow, but\nwithout money for the ticket and for\nbribes, things looked a bit dubious.\nSo during the remaining day of pan-ic, I went to the few banks Goma had\nbut my card would not be accepted an-ywhere, nor could I access any funds.\nThe only option was a Western Union money transfer but most of these\nwere already closed for the day and as\ntime went on, I was starting to get very\nworried.\nAs unlucky as I usually am, sometimes fate feels really sorry for me\nand helps me out, and that afternoon\nwas one such exception. After losing\nall hope and feeling severely stressed,\nI was going back to my accommodation despondent, considering I could\nno longer even afford that, when I saw\none final Western Union branch. I got a\nfeeling that this had to be it and thank-fully, mercifully, it was. They were open\nfor another 35 minutes and also had an\nof the boat where the one guy who\nknew English dealt with me. \u201c40 dollars\u201d he said. \u201c25\u201d said I. \u201cAgreed\u201d came\nthe reply.\nIt wasn\u2019t too steep considering the\nstate of things. My bag was taken from\nme and stowed away safely. I was led\nto the VIP section and got to sit there\nin shade while the boat chugged away\nslowly from the lakeside.\nI once again got my camera out to\ncapture the moment, getting one shot\nof the burgeoning boat before everyone in that photo shouted me down at\nthe top of their voice. There must be a\ncultural reason for this I thought.\nAs I got to Bukavu five hours later, I\npondered over all that had happened. I\nfelt like the most insignificant visitor to\nthe Congo, yet one who was lucky and\nunlucky enough to witness a proportion of its problems first hand. I suppose I came in looking for adventure\nand I got it, but in the process fell in\nlove with the raw excitement offered by\nthis relatively lawless country. There is\nvast potential to make a difference here\nand I aim to return someday.\nUpon getting to Bukavu, I boarded\nthe first taxi I saw and headed to Cyangugu in Rwanda. Just one final $10\nbribe freed me as I came face to face\nwith the dense jungles of South Rwanda. Where now? I thought.\n\u201cThe Congolese are stupid\u201d Kennedy\nhad once said to me, \u201cthey can\u2019t see that\nthey are themselves ripping their own\ncountry apart\u201d, and most of his friends I\nmet agreed. To understand the Democratic Republic of Congo, one obviously needs to live there and let it absorb\nthem. So far, I have just talked about\nwhat happened to me but this is just\none half of my trip there. Next week I\nwill try and cover the other half, detailing what Congo has to offer, my crude\nattempts to learn some things and my\nresulting limited understanding.\n\u201cthe shock of\nseeing the entire\ncity suddenly\nswarming with\nthe presidential\nguard and the\narmy when the\nday before it had\nbeen as dead as\na goat was quite\nsomething!\u201d\n\u201cand literally\nwaved the wad\nof notes at the\ngunmen and the\nofficials\u201d\nGetting to Bukavu on an overcrowded boat\nA village elder engages me in some local boardgames\n\n"

    "content": "games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n33\nFriday 22 February 2008 felix\nGames\ning a Boss character. It\u2019s a little annoy-ing, but fortunately the encounters can\noften make it more than worth your\ntime.\nDevil May Cry has also been characterised by particularly memorable and\ndeliciously difficult boss battles. Similarly, each fracas here boasts visually\narresting design and resilient yet gratifying combat. Now, maybe it\u2019s just that\nI\u2019ve played a lot of the demo and/or I\u2019ve\nplayed Devil May Cry 3 quite a bit but\nI didn\u2019t find the first boss \u2013 the fiery\ndemon Berial \u2013 particularly challeng-ing. I was actually quite disappointed\nto have won in the first round without\ngetting hit. In retrospect, DMC3\u2019s Cerberus handed my ass back to me more\ntimes than I can bear to reveal. It\u2019s a little annoying at first but the game does\npick up in challenge (with some annoyingly uneven spikes) later on.\nTo help those along, the game continues presenting certain Hidden Missions. These are intense, focused extra\nlevels that adhere a somewhat strict\nobjective for victory and as a result,\nharken back to the difficulty heights of\nold. Granted, while some are quite ex-citing, the remainder can be just frustrating beyond belief.\nNow, this isn\u2019t all about Nero hogging the sinister limelight since Dante\nis about Devil May Cry as much as the\ngames are about him. It\u2019s not too long\nafter you start getting cosy with Nero\nthat the original badass comes back in\naction, replete with leather chaps and\nmore deliciously corny one-liners that\nyou can shake an entire Kellogg\u2019s factory at. Since he\u2019s is no longer the main\nfocus, it\u2019s almost like his very presence\nis a blessing and that\u2019s why he compensates with an assload of new armaments that can only be the result of the\ndesigner downing more than one\u2019s fair\nshare of sak\u00e9.\nWhile you may end up running back\nto the sword Rebellion for nostalgia\u2019s\nsake there\u2019s no denying that Messrs\u2019\nLucifer and Gilgamesh and a certain\nMiss Pandora\u2019s Box (all the names of\nhis new weapons) offer some exciting new options wherein the word\ninsane is often juxtaposed with under-statement. While it may seem a little\nanachronistic, he also retains his major\n\u2018Styles\u2019 from DMC3 which can be interchanged with the correct D-pad di-rections. Mid-combo weapon switching is pretty damn cool but switching\nStyles? Depending on your preferences\nyou might as well stick to a particular\naugmentation, only switching when it\u2019s\nsafe to move your thumb off of the Analog Stick. However, the option is commended for being present either way.\nYeah. I really, really like this game.\nAnd why not? Besides all these quali-ties, the game is a true embodiment of\nbest qualities of the first and third iterations and that is what fans have pretty\nmuch desired since the trailers teased\nus two years prior. It\u2019s atmospheric\nand visuals come across as stunning,\nsharp and all manner of other positive\nsuperlatives.\nBut alas, all is not as shiny as the\nreflections off of the windows in this\ngame. While the game invariable desires to recall the greatest moments in\nthe series\u2019, it also often flounders when\nit fails to reach them. It may be in subjective view but I fail to see characters\nascolourfulandpersonableasArkham/\nJester, Vergil and Trish (who makes a\nshort-lived return). Similarly the plot\nin the last game comes across as much\nmore focused and with a stronger (only\ncomparitively) emphasis on character\ndevelopment. Of course, that could be\njust the horrible, horrible memories of\nthe putrid animated series, but there\nis something lacking about the overall\nimpetus to your journey that the other\ngames possessed. The constant flaunt-ingoftheoppositesex\nin various positions\nof, erm, unrest are\nsimilarly grating. And\nthe ultimate fail is simply\nthat DMC4 doesn\u2019t represent a paradigm shift that the Resident Evil series\u2019\nexperienced with its fourth official ver-sion. There is quite a bit of backtracking\nwhen playing as Dante which reeks of\nthe developer taking shortcuts as well\nas some suspect puzzle portions that\nget very old very quickly. Just furthering the misery are an unwieldy camera\ninherited from its forebears and a surprisingly long install on the PlayStation\n3 hard-drive, although the series\u2019 recap\nwas rather enjoyable.\nBut who gives a damn.\nDevil May Cry has always been\nabout grabbing the Devil by the balls\nand then swinging him around in ways\nthat makes nunchuk masters blush\nwith embarrassment. Devil May Cry\n4 is cheesy, it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s gorgeous and\nabove all the else, the gameplay is still\nunmatched in terms of unabridged,\nuncomprised and unrestrained style\nthat\u2019s as deep and downright satisfying\nas it appears to spellbound onlookers.\nAnd it\u2019s damn good to be wielding your\nold friends Ebony and Ivory yet again.\nDevil Arms\nThe first boss fight against Berial\nis a great way to put most of your\nskills to use. It\u2019s also a fun way of\nwitnessing the true potential of\nyour nascent Devil Bringer.\nBesides helping with grappling\npuzzles, the Devil Bringer is a\nclever offensive tool. It allows\nyou to close the gap between enemies (in this case, by bringing\nyou closer to its weak point).\nHere, once you\u2019ve dealt sufficient damage and snuffed out\nthe crimson flames, it becomes\npossible to either lift the great\ndemon into the air and then slam\nhim downwards or send him flying with a massive uppercut.\nAs you\u2019ll notice further on, your\nDevil Bringer actions differ from\nenemy to enemy so it\u2019s sometimes handier to pick up one\ntype of foe that can be hurled\ninto into others to create some\nbreathing space. Remember: the\ngame is about creating your own\nepic niche in combat.\nDevil Bringer\nAlastor\nEbony and Ivory\nNothing beats the trusty old\ncombination of the electricity\nimbued Alastor and the rapid-fire handguns Ebony & Ivory.\nHowever, being characterised\nby insane weapons, Devil May\nCry always affords you plenty\nof interesting choices.\nCerberus\nNevan\nThe tri-headed flails/nunchuks\nCerberus and the, well, guitar\nNevan were unique additions\nto Devil May Cry 3.

You\u2019re probably\nwondering why there was no Gaming\nsection last week and\nfor those of you who\nmissed their\nfix: I apol-ogise. I\nwas rather\nbusy then\nand couldn\u2019t make\ntime, so yeah.\nAnyway, we\u2019re back in full action\nfor this week with a gander at one of\nthe premier action games you\u2019ll be\nplaying this year in the form of one\nDevil May Cry 4.\nThe Devil May Cry series has long\nbeen a herald for pure action in the 3rd\ndimension, introducing all manner of\nmanouevres and tactics, some only endemic to 2D games of old. It set forth\nsimple colours to indicate health, magic and experience, placed the emphasis\non facing enemies that offered stiff resistance and then gave your character\nenough prowess to make them feel like\nthey were gods in their own rights.\nAlso, the gun-sword combination\ncomes across as ridiculously cool, allowing shooter fans and close-quarters\nbrawlers alike to find a mode of play.\nThe boss fights in particular were salient in that they did the \u2018boss\u2019 moniker\nproud. Excruciatingly difficult with\nmultiple encounters, these demons\nmade you pull off every trick in the\nbook to just survive. Winning was\nquite a gratifying blessing. My favourite boss in DMC to date stands as Nelo\nAngelo. Being humanoid in size, he\nseemed less impressive from the other\nmassive characters you fought. However, he makes up by being enigmatic,\nhaving an actual backstory and being\ncapable of wiping your ass off his boots\nwithin a matter of seconds. He was\nharder, faster and yes, much stronger\nthan you despite being (spoiler warn-ing... for a near-decade old spoiler...) a\nformer shadow of your twin brother.\n\u2018twas rather brilliant indeed. Devil\nMay Cry 2, despite all the hype and\nrather exciting trailers turned out to be\na less polished, far tamer affair: solid as\nan action game, shoddy as a Devil May\nCry game. Fortunately, Devil May Cry\n3 redeemed itself by being the veritable Nelo Angelo: better than the first\nin every way (sans the atmosphere,\nmethinks).\nBesides our prime focus on Devil\nMay Cry 4, Sebb picks up his flamethrower and sprays all the n00bs of\ngaming with hot burning death. Alex\nis back offering more musings on the\nbrilliant Ninja Gaiden (the other awesome action game) and Andrew Lyle\nmakes his debut for the Games section\nby giving us his thoughts on the new\nHalo, from an entirely different per-spective, if you get my point.\nByte looks at two action-heavy\ngames: hack-and-slasher Achilles and\na brilliant Flash adaptation of Unreal\nTournament.\nAs always your input is always welcome at games.felix@imperial.ac.uk.\nGood news: we may be setting up a\nSteam community so stay tuned!\nThis\nWeek\nFinish the fight... again\nI shall burninate thee!\nDevil arm vs... Devil... arm? Ninja Flippin\u2019 Slash\nDemons weep, devils cry\nAzfarul Islam finds the devil within and realises that it only wants to be loved\nT\nhe most difficult thing\nabout taking a look at\nDevil May Cry 4 is trying to avoid any discourse\nabout the previous games.\nTell you what, I\u2019ll save that for the editorial you see on your left-hand-side\nand immediately slash and Stinger my\nway into the fourth iteration of the\ngame that redefined the action genre.\nUnfortunately, DMC4 cannot lay\nclaim to such a lofty goal. That, it\ncan\u2019t.\nHowever, it knows the heritage that\ncourses through its veins leaving but\none option and that\u2019s to get the party\nstarted.\nA rather innocuous introduction scene regarding the Order\nof the\nSword\nin the medieval\nvilla of Fortuna takes a\ngrisly turn as the hero\nof Devil May Crys\npast crashes\nthrough\nthe ceiling\nand tears\nthrough the cultists with reckless\nabandon. He even shoots the feeble old\nhead priest in the, well, head. Now, we\nall know that Dante is an iconoclastic\nbadass but a villain he is not and this\nshocking behaviour sets a basic tempo\nfor the story. Of course, all that is completely derailed when you realise that\nafter the deliciously choreographed\ncutscene ends, you\u2019ve assumed control of a similarly silver-coiffed warrior\nnamed Nero.\nNero seems to be just as lackadaisical as our former-hero-turned-mur-derer-or-is-he-really and the cheese he\nspouts is worthy of the thickest Quattro Formaggio pizza you can order. Ah,\nit\u2019s already invoked nostalgia. It seems\nthat Nero\u2019s only impetus is a rather\npretty girl named Kyrie (despite all linguistic logic, pronounced \u201cKi-ree-ey\u201d)\nand later on, when she is abducted,\nNero may find himself in an unlikely alliance with Dante. Yeah,\ntotally unex-pected.\nMmmhmm.\nA proper\nplot does not a\nDevil May Cry\nmake and the\nrather silly sto-ry, despite the\nearly momentum\nthat drives pro-gression, serves\nonly to put\nin some dialogue in the otherwise gorgeous cut-scenes. And by Sparda, are these brimming with unfettered creative prowess\nor what? Carrying on the insanity of\nDevil May Cry 3, the move to the visual fidelity of High-Def only makes the\nexperience Sweet and it\u2019s definitely got\nSmokin\u2019 Sick Style to match.\nAnd this is where Devil May Cry\nsimply erupts into brilliance. It offers a luxuriously mercurial, tractable\nfighting system where you have every\nopportunity to unleash your own eye\ncandy. Nero\u2019s addition can only augment this and indeed, he does so with\nspellbinding panache. His arcane Devil\nBringer offers a whole new variant of\norganic combat that allows you to dictate the range and keeps the orb counter constantly ticking.\nIn a single flourish, you may cleave\nupwards with the Red Queen (see\nDevil Arms) and then continue rising\nas you slash at your foe without mercy.\nJust as it falls happily to the ground to\nwrithe and die in peace, you snatch it\nup with the Devil Bringer and continue your unique brand of pain\ntherapy. You can slam them into\nthe ground, whirl them till they\u2019re\ndizzy and hurl them into their onrushing allies. It\u2019s rather glorious\nand once again does what a DMC\ndoes best: offer you a cogent feeling of empowerment. And you will\nremain creatively challenged as you\nfight of hordes of daemons since the\ngame still retains the ever-rewarding\nStyle rankings that tick from an embarrassing D to a coveted SSS. Yup, \u2018just\nS\u2019 still isn\u2019t good enough: that\u2019s how\nDMC rolls. The only reason this works\nso well is that the controls are pitched\nwith poise. They come across as rather\nintrinsic; finely-tuned and tightly-re-sponsive. This means that most, if not\nall, failures to make the enemy submit\nboil down to personal skills, co-ordina-tion and creativity.\nYou\u2019re able to exchange points in\norder to buy a multitude of tiered attacks that offer a smorgasbord of va-riety. This means that you can truly\ncustomise your character towards a\ncombat bias that you prefer. There is\nno right combination here since all offer interesting balances and it\u2019s really\nupto one\u2019s own tastes and experimentation desires. In a prescient move on\nCapcom\u2019s part, you\u2019re able to refund all\npreviously bought skills and then re-buy as you see fit anytime you want to.\nThe only disturbing thing about this is\nthat you no longer use the iconic Red\nOrbs for upgrades; this crimson demon blood is relegated to arcane items\nonly. Now, you need to attain Proud\nHearts that are only awarded after fac-Review\nOle! Dante is still as suave as ever\n\n"

Over the\nnext ten pages we\u2019ll\nbe bringing you manifestos from each\ncandidate as well interviews with the\nPresidential candidates. Sabbatical\ncandidates were requested to submit\n250-word long manifestos. In the interests of fairness, each candidate has\nbeen given the same amount of space,\nhence the frightfully ugly blank spaces\nat the end of some manifestos! For the\nPresidential interviews, we\u2019ve asked the\nsame questions to each candidate. Occasionally we probed the candidates to\nexpand on their answers, hence some\ntranscripts have additional questions.\nLater on in the feature you\u2019ll find\nshorter, 100-word long manifestos for\nthe Student Trustee and NUS Delegate\ncandidates along with a few short explanations describing what they\u2019re required for.\nVoting is open online now at www.\nimperialcollegeunion.org/vote, but before you head there, here\u2019s a quick run\ndown of the main issues facing the students hoping to sell their soul\u2019s to the\nUnion:\nThe National Union of Students\n(NUS):\nImperial College Union rejoined the\nNUS last year but signs of change have\nbeen barely noticeable. The NUS is\ncurrently undergoing some crucial\nreforms which \u2013 all going well \u2013 will\nbe in place from April after the 2008\nConference.\nHow deep these changes will run\nremains to be seen though. Some believe that the reforms are merely paper changes that will only affect those\ndeeply involved with their Union such\nas Sabbatical and Club Officers, whereas supporters feel that big enough\nchanges at the top will be seen by the\ngeneral student body on the ground.\nNext year\u2019s Sabbaticals will have to decide the best ways of utilising a \u00a344k\nper year institution.\nUnion Masterplan Phase Two\nThe Masterplan is the Union\u2019s rejuvenation project which has been running\nfor the last couple of years. Phase Two,\nwhich includes the development of a\nnew Student Activities Centre and the\nadditions of a dance studio and refurbished gym, has been given the green\nlight. Next year\u2019s Sabbs will have to\nVoting open!: www.imperialcollegeunion.org/vote\nWhat are the Sabbs for? Voting explained\nVoting is open now. If you log on to\nwww.imperialcollegeunion.org/\nvote you should see the page similar\nto the picture above, albeit with a nice\nlogin window to make sure you aren\u2019t\nrigging the election.\nOperate the voting system using\nyour College username and password to log in. Select the election you\nwant to vote in, then you will have a\nselection of the positions that are up\nfor grabs.\nTell them which candidate you pre-fer, then repeat for each position\nremembering to indicate an order of\npreference to the other candidates (see\nbox for explanation on how the voting\nsystem works.)\nEnjoy your new Sabbatical, Student\nTrustee, and NUS teams, and the\nhavoc that they will inevitably wreak\no\u2019er the land. They\u2019ve got me locked in\nthe basement \u2018til elections are over and\noh god, I can hear them coming...\nensure it\u2019s delivered smoothly, on time\nand to spec.\nUnion Masterplan Phase Three\nPhase Three is some way off yet, however the incoming Sabbs will probably\nbe involved in securing funds for the\ndevelopment and they will certainly be\nable to influence the design decisions.\n2009 Higher Education Funding\nReview\nThe government will be conducting a\nreview of Top-up Fees next year. The\ncurrent \u00a33,000 cap could be increased\nor even lifted entirely. Next year\u2019s Sabbaticals will have to represent the views\nof the student body on a national scale\nand be prepared to fight for what ICU\u2019s\nmembers want.\nA new Rector and change in the\nCollege regime\nThe current Imperial College Overlord\nSir Richard Sykes is stepping down in\nthe summer to make way for the new\nRector, Sir Roy Anderson. The Sabbaticals regularly work with College staff\nand a change in College\u2019s style would\ndefinitely affect the day-to-day life and\nrunning of the Union.\nN\not much! Ahahaha. Er,\nlet\u2019s be serious people,\ncome on. The Sabbs\nplay a vital role in the\nrunning of the Union\nand you really ought to think carefully\nbefore you decide on who to vote for.\nIf you pick someone solely on the basis of how good looking you think they\nare, or whether you agree with their\nattire or not, you\u2019ve only got yourself\nto blame when they\u2019re successfully\nelected and proceed to hike-up drink\nprices by 20% to pay for their executive\nleather chair and Cuban cigars.\nYes, the Sabbs are taking either a year\nout from their studies or before they\nhead out into the real world, but it\u2019s not\njust simply a \u2018year out\u2019. Their decisions\nreally do affect the student body and in\nthe following several paragraphs we\u2019ll\nexplain the functions of each role:\nUnion President\nThe big cheese. The King of the Dawghouse. The MacDaddy. Essentially the\nUnion President oversees the entire\nUnion and all its students. He/she is\nthe boss of the three Deputy Presidents\nand has a hand in permanent staffing\nmatters too.\nThe President has regular meetings\nwith College staff including the Rector so he/she needs to be able to argue\nfor the Union and hold his/her ground\naround experienced people. At the\nsame time, the President needs to be\napproachable and easy for students to\ncommunicate with.\nThe character of the President sets\nthe character of the Union for the year,\nso vote wisely.\nDeputy President Clubs &\nSocieties\nThe DPCS is responsible for overseeing\nall of the clubs and societies at Imperial so if you\u2019re a member of one, there\u2019s\na good chance you\u2019ll have to deal with\nthis person at some point.\nHe/she is responsible for organising\nFreshers\u2019 Fair at the start of the year\nand with over 250 clubs at Imperial, it\u2019s\nan operation that requires meticulous\nplanning over the summer period.\nDeputy President Finance &\nServices\nThe DPFS is responsible for pretty\nmuch every budget within the Union.\nThat means club, events and the bars\u2019\nbudgets. If you\u2019re club has to pay for\nsomething expensive, this person has\nthe power to prevent you from doing\nso. Similarly to the DPCS, this person\nhas to regularly deal with students, often clueless ones who don\u2019t know how\nthe Union\u2019s financing system works.\nHe/she needs patience and a mild spot\nof OCD will help with signing claim\nform after claim form.\nDeputy President Education &\nWelfare\nThe DPEW is the mother or father-fig-ure of the student body. He/she is responsible for making sure students are\nwell looked after, have a home or halls\nto live in, aren\u2019t getting too stressed out\nwith work and are able to cope when\nthey run into financial troubles.\nThis person has to deal with students\non a one-to-one basis and definitely\nneeds to be approachable, but he/she\nalso has to attend a plethora of meetings with various welfare related committees in College, so needs to be able\nto argue a point well.\nFelix Editor\n1,000,000 points to the bright spark\nwho correctly guesses what this person\nis for.\nThe Felix Editor is tasked with producing 30 issues of Felix a year and the\nUnion Freshers\u2019 Handbook. If they feel\nup to the task, they can also help publish issues of I,Science and Phoenix.\nThe Editor is responsible for galva-nising a team of voluntary students to\nproduce weekly content. How do you\nplay it? Demand content to be on the\ndot and risk dispiriting your team and\nlosing late content, or play it more leniently but suffer the consequences of\nall-nighter sessions editing the articles\nthat invariably come in just before the\nvery final deadline?\nHe/she is also responsible for the Felix website, the finances and also delivering the newspaper across campus.\nSingle Transferable Vote\nICU uses the Single Transferable Voting system (STV). In\nthis system the voter assigns\neach candidate a preference\nnumber, with 1 being the most\nfavoured. Ideally, you number\neach and every candidate.\nIf whoever you put a 1 beside\ndoes not get enough votes\nto be elected (or has already\naquired enough votes to be\nelected in the case of multiple posts), your vote goes to\nthe candidate that you put a\nnumber 2 beside.\nThus if I hate A, love B, and\nlike C: I\u2019d put a 1 next to B, a 2\nnext to C, a 3 next to RON, and\na 4 next to A to make sure the\nbastard never gets in.\n\n"

    "content": "A cross-disciplinary department\nD\neveloping a sustainable energy\nfuture involves providing clean,\nsecure and affordable energy to\na growing market. However, the\ngrowth of first-world economies,\nthe emergence of new energy-guzzling nations,\nthe depletion of fossil fuels, technological limi-tations, and complex climatic and geopolitical\nscenarios are making energy policies increasingly\ndifficult to craft out.\nThe future of energy production and distribution\nis so intricate that an approach where technology,\neconomics and politics are viewed independently\nwill necessarily be ineffective. In fact, tackling the\nenergy challenge will require a holistic approach,\nand this is exactly what the Energy Futures Lab of\nImperial College is set to achieve.\nHoused in Civil Engineering\u2019s Skempton Building, the Energy Futures Lab aims to tackle important energy questions by harnessing the expertise of various departments around the college.\nImperial\u2019s mastery of engineering and scientific\ndisciplines such as energy efficiency, nuclear energy and transport, coupled with input concerning economics, policy-making and risk from the\nTanaka Business School, makes it an excellent\nmotor for research and innovation in the field of\nenergy policy.\nThis multidisciplinary approach is ideal, since it\nallows the Energy Futures Lab to combine the research performed within departments at Imperial\nto the United Kingdom Energy Research Centre\n(EKERC), the Carbon Trust and the government.\nImportantly, the Lab acts as a bridge between the\nuniversity and industry, thus ensuring that the research carried out within Imperial\u2019s departments\nis relevant to the actual requirements of real life\napplications. This collaboration is seen through\nsome of the research projects currently being carried out at the Lab.\nThe BP-Imperial Urban Energy Systems investigates various ways by which cities could optimise\nthe use of resources such as power, heating and\nEnergy Futures Lab: what\u2019s it all about?\nVij Dhayan gives us the lowdown on the centre taking a holistic approach to the energy challenge\nIrini Kyriacou and Federica Dalamel de Bournet talk to Prof Nigel Bell and Dr Nick Voulvoulis about the\nCentre for Environmental Policy and how changes in science are catching up with changes in policy\nT\nhe Centre for Environmental Policy\n(CEP) is a vibrant department situated in the heart of the Mechanical\nEngineering building, and also at Silwood Park. We met with Nigel Bell,\nProfessor of Environmental Pollution and Director of the MSc in Environmental Technology, and\nthen Dr Nick Voulvoulis, Senior Lecturer and\nexpert in Waste and Wastewater Management.\nThey kindly accepted to meet and talk to us about\nCEP\u2019s work.\nThe Centre is a unique interface between science\nand technology, and economics and policy. Scientists, economists and social and policy experts\nwork towards gathering the scientific evidence\nnecessary to implement new environmental poli-cies, or, alternatively, support policies already in\nplace. \u201cWe collect the evidence in order to change\nor develop [environmental] policy\u201d explains Dr\nVoulvoulis. However, most policies are set in\nplace before the scientific evidence is present.\nThis is \u201cbecause science does not move as fast\nas policy\u201d. The CEP is working towards inverting\nthat trend.\nAs a result, the Centre actively collaborates with\ninstitutional bodies such as the Department for\nEnvironment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), Research Councils UK and the Environment Agency\namongst others. Part of CEP\u2019s work involves obtaining information from medics, engineers and\nscientists across College to understand where the\nneeds for new policies stand. Similarly, amending\nand modifying policies currently in place requires\nstrong scientific evidence which the CEP gathers\nfrom Imperial\u2019s outstanding science and technology research.\nAs the name suggests, CEP\u2019s expertise touches\nall areas of the environment from energy to pol-lution, conservation of resources, food and environmental security, and poverty reduction. The\nexcellence of Imperial\u2019s research, which is carried\nout in such an extensive range of subjects, makes\nit an especially suitable place for the CEP to carry\nout its mission.\nThe department also runs one of the most successful and innovative post-graduate MSc courses at Imperial, the MSc in Environmental Technology. It is currently the largest MSc on campus,\nwith ca. 135 students enrolled every year. The\nnature of this course is highly interdisciplinary.\nIndeed, the course comprises modules as diverse\nas Ecology, Environmental Law, Risk Assessment,\nEnvironmental Economics, Environmental Pollution and Control, and Environmental Policy and\nManagement. In the 2nd Term students choose\nan area of specialization such as Business and the\nEnvironment, Energy Policy, Water Management\nand many more, depending on their academic\nbackground and interests.\nA significant number of MSc students remain\nwithin the Department to pursue a PhD. Currently the Centre is home to approximately 80\nPhD students. The research projects are highly\ncross-disciplinary, and focus on current or potential upcoming environmental issues in the UK\nand world-wide. PhD projects are often jointly\nsupervised by the CEP and one or more other\ndepartments.\nLast but not least, the CEP houses the Imperial Centre for Energy Policy and Technology\n(ICEPT). The latter is an academic hub which\nfocuses on the link between energy and the en-vironment. Interdisciplinary research carried out\n(Bioenergy, Energy in Developing Countries, Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Energy, Decentralised Energy and Transition, Innovation and Policy) grants\nICEPT with the necessary expertise to lead the\nTechnology and Policy Assessment (TPA) function of the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC).\nThe UKERC is the UK\u2019s pre-eminent centre of\nresearch on sustainable energy systems; it was\nestablished in 2004, following a recommendation\nby Sir David King, the UK Government\u2019s Chief\nScientific Advisor in office at the time.\nCEP\u2019s academics work together towards establishing trans-disciplinary expertise in the environmental field. The aim is to translate science\ninto policy. The next step is to make sure policies\nare endorsed and respected by citizens.\nwater, or improve their transport systems. This is\ndone by using complex modelling techniques onto\nwhich business and policy factors are grafted, and\nby comparing current and novel approaches used\nin managing big cities.\nAnother interesting endeavour of the Lab is the\nShell-Imperial College Grand Challenge Programme on Clean Fossil Fuels, the main targets\nof which are to find ways of limiting the release of\ngreenhouse gases during the extraction of fossil\nfuels and the delivery of energy and by-products\nto consumers. This will be done hrough analysis\nof the supply chain and either limiting the amount\nof C02 produced or capturing what is released.\nThe Energy Futures Lab offers MSc courses in\nSustainable Energy Futures and Environmental\nTechnology, and cross-disciplinary PhD research\nthemes.\nThe Energy Futures Lab is currently working with BP to research how cities can optimise the efficiency of their existing energy sources\nThe CEP is working to improve the UK\u2019s environmental policies and its countryside\n3\n\n"

The\nrole is about helping to\nremove the barriers, be they financial\nor emotional, which stop students doing their best while at Imperial. It is a\nrole I would really love to take on, not\nfor some power trip, but because I enjoy helping my peers.\nI\u2019ve had some difficult times while at\nImperial and have benefited from the\nsupport of my fellow students and the\nwelfare services the College and the\nUnion have provided. There is always\nroom for improvement however. For\nexample, we need personal tutors who\nhave an interest in student welfare,\nwho receive more training and who\nare proactive in making sure students\nfeel comfortable to come to them with\nproblems.\nMoney\u2019s always a worry for any student which is why I want to review\nthe pricing of halls, make it easier for\nstudents to find appropriate jobs and\nlook at improving uptake of bursary\nschemes. Promoting good health is\nimportant as well by, for example, improving bicycle facilities.\nAs president of I.Q.

It was great to see that I was\nhelping to make other students\u2019 time\nat Imperial a happy one.

If you don\u2019t like any of\nthem vote RON in the elections \u2013 it\nmakes sense, you probably just don\u2019t\nknow it yet.\nIf you vote for The Weasley not only\nwill I ensure Phase 2 of the Beit Redevelopment is delivered before my term\nhas even started, I\u2019ll add three more\nphases to the Masterplan including:\nrocket boosters under Beit Quad so\nthat it levitates 50m off the ground, the\nentire demolition of the West Basement with Australia as a replacement\nand our very own star to ensure a\nregulated temperature of 18.89 degrees Celsius throughout the Union.\nAll without breaking a sweat.\nAs for Felix: burn it all. Every\nstudent will be given an owl or flying squirrel which will tell them the\nhoroscopes or whatever they want\non request.\nOn a serious note: You can vote\nfor RON if you don\u2019t think any\ncandidate is suitable. RON runs\nagainst all the candidates and\nelecting RON will restart that\nstrand of elections only.\nYou\u2019ve read the Sabb manifestos, now vote!\nwww.imperialcollegeunion.org/vote\n8\n\n"

    "content": "Investigating Imperial\u2019s efforts to\nconserve the world\u2019s environment\nW\nelcome to the Environmental Research pullout:\nGreen\u2019perial! We hope this\nFelix supplement will give you\na good insight into Imperial\u2019s\nresearch in the areas of climate change, energy\nand the environment. Imperial\u2019s highest calibre\nscientists and engineers work at the forefront\nin these fields; many of them are advisors to the\nGovernment and international organisations on\nsome of the biggest environmental challenges of\nthe century.\nIf you take a look over to the right of this page,\nyou\u2019ll see a rundown of the contents. Inside you\u2019ll\nfind interviews with a number of Imperial\u2019s researchers hoping to make the environment a\ngreener place; the centre spread covers environ-mentally-related projects happening in the departments around campus; there is a piece on the\nresurgence of coal as a viable energy source and\nfinally, on the back page, the experts tell us about\nthe environment\u2019s future and give you some\npointers on how to get involved.\nAt the beginning of this academic year, Federica\ncame up with the idea of an informative piece\nabout Imperial\u2019s environmental research. Indeed,\nit occurred to us that even after 3 years of full-time study at Imperial, we were still quite clueless\nas to the kinds of environmental and sustainable\nresearch the College is engaged in. As we browsed\na few websites, we became aware of the considerable extent of environmental work at Imperial\nand decided to investigate further. The investigation has been a team effort since the beginning,\nand as the days went past we became more and\nmore ambitious about the contents of the piece\nwe wanted to write. Somewhere along the line,\nBrian, Roger and Vij joined forces with us. We\nhope you enjoy the fruits of our labour!\nWe would also like to say a great big thank you to\nEd, Science Editor, and Tom, Editor-in-Chief, of\nthe Felix team. Without them this pullout would\nnot have seen the light of day. They supported\nand guided us throughout the project, and they\nalso spent many hours putting everything togeth-er, giving it a journalistic touch, and crafting out\nthe brilliant design that you can see here.\nA special thank you goes to all the people we have\ninterviewed or talked to. We found College\u2019s staff\nvery approachable and all the people we met were\ngenerally very enthusiastic about the whole idea\nof a special piece on environmental research. Unfortunately, we could not include all of the information provided to us due to lack of space, but\nmost of it is there. A particularly difficult decision\nhad to be made regarding Brian Giannakopoulos\u2019\npiece on Civil and Environmental Engineering.\nWe were painfully short of space, and as a result\nyou will find Brian\u2019s highly informative article in\nthe Science pages of this Felix issue.\nFinally, we hope you will enjoy reading this pullout as much as we enjoyed putting it together!\nWell, ok, we\u2019ll be honest with you, there were\nfrustrating moments, but as a whole the experience it was a hugely enjoyable one. The best part\nwas undeniably the chance to meet so many of\nImperial\u2019s staff and students who are all so passionate about their work.\nIrini and Federica\nContents\nPage 8\nCredits Written by Irini Kyriacou and Federica Dalamel de Bournet, and assisted by Vij Dhayan and Roger Rouhana.\nDesigned by Tom Roberts and edited by Edmund Henley.

The answers will only come, I believe,\nfrom scientific communities in which teams\nof scientists, engineers and medics of all\ndisciplines work side by side, bringing\ntheir different expertise and techniques\nto approach each challenge from every\nangle.\n\u201d Sir Richard Sykes\nRector of Imperial College London\nIntroduction\nPage 1\nThe Grantham\nInstitute\u2019s Dr\nSimon Buckle\nPage 2\nCentre for\nEnvironmental\nPolicy, Energy\nFutures Lab\nPage 3\nDepartmental\nresearch group\ninnovations\nPages 4 & 5\nThe Energy and\nEnvironment\nOffice\u2019s Dr Tariq\nPage 6\nBlack is back \u2013 The\nreturn of coal\nPage 7\nWhat Imperial\u2019s\nprofessionals have\nto say and how\nyou can help\n\n"

This year I\u2019ve also been\nthe Social Clubs Committee Chair,\nlooking after lots of other societies, as\nwell as sitting on central Union committees such as the Clubs and Societies Board, Council and the Executive\nCommittee.\nDuring my time as a club officer and\nthrough working in the Student Activities Centre for 4 years, I\u2019ve come\nface-to-face with a lot of the things\nthat frustrate clubs. I would develop\nan online room booking system for\nchecking room availability and booking College rooms, making life much\neasier for clubs.\nClub finances can still be a major\nsource of confusion. I would ensure\nthat club officers don\u2019t get their budgets frozen without warning and that\nthey have adequate access to Finance\nSupport staff. I would push for more\npart-time staff to help ensure that the\nonline transaction pages are up-to-date\nand would have ongoing club training\nthroughout the year.\nIf elected, I would make changes that\nwould have a real difference for the\nclubs and societies at Imperial, the students who put so much time and effort\ninto running them and the students\nwho participate in club activities. No\ngimmicks, just real, practical things.\nI also promise to ensure there is a\nworking bike pump attached to the\nBeit bicycle racks.\nDEPUTY\nPRESIDENT\nFINANCE\n&\nSERVICES\nChristian Carter\nE\nlect me as DPFS and I will:\n\u2022 Be available to you in\nSAC every Wednesday afternoon for club surgeries.\n\u2022 Improve, update and\nmodernise Finance training.\n\u2022 Address the hygiene standards of\nUnion Catering.\n\u2022 Aim to replace equipment in the\nbars which is not fit for purpose.\n\u2022 Keep drinks prices to a minimum.\n\u2022 Introduce a tiered wage system for\nbar staff.\n\u2022 Aim to lower ents prices to Union\nevents.\n\u2022 Introduce better communication\nof the catering and bars opening times\nwith the students.\n\u2022 Give you a summer ball that you\nwant.\nTo see my full manifesto go to http://\ncarter.for.dpfs.googlepages.com/\nVoting open: www.imperialcollegeunion.org/vote\nDEPUTY\nPRESIDENT\nCLUBS\n&\nSOCIETIES\nJohn James\nI\nam studying Civil Engineering\nand am currently in my third\nyear. I spend most of my time\nmaintaining the RCS and RSM\nmotorised mascots, after being\nChairman of RCSMC for two years. I\nam a member of Choir, the University\nRoyal Naval Unit, and in my time at\nImperial I have been across the channel with Yacht Club, helped to found\nCheese Society, and been Vice Chairman of RAG.\nI have attended council since my\nfirst year and I have attended Clubs\nand Societies Board, Health and Safety\nCommittee and Exec. Having taken a\nyear in industry, I am committed to\nworking above and beyond forty hours\na week and being Lord Mayor\u2019s Show\nCoordinator has shown that I am no\nstranger to big events.\nIf elected I will:\nHold a Refreshers\u2019 Fair in the spring\nterm. This will give students a second\nchance to join summer clubs such as\ncricket, and also to reflect on which\nclubs they really want to be members\nof after the chaos of the first term.\nHold an Inter-Faculty Sports day.\nThis will strengthen Faculty Union relations while promoting a healthy competitive rivalry. I will support Faculty\nUnion autonomy in providing sporting\nactivities that their members can get\ninvolved in.\nIntroduceFast-trackfinancetraining.\nAn online finance test for club officers\nwould unfreeze their budget without\nthe need to attend finance training.\nOnly Officers who fail the test would\nneed to attend training.\nFor all twenty-five reasons to vote\nJohn James visit www.votejohnjames.\ncom\nJess Marley\nI\n\u2019m Jess Marley, a final year Maths\nstudent from Cardiff! I have\nbeen elected as Netball Club\nCaptain for the past 2 years and\nhave represented the Union for\nthe 1st team, and take an active role in\nthe social side of the club. I was also a\nRe-App at Fisher Hall last year.\nIn my role as Netball Club Captain,\nI\u2019ve gained valuable experience of how\nclubs and societies work and what\nClub Committees in particular need\nfrom their Sabbs and other Union offi-cials. This has given me a great understanding of what general members of\nclubs and societies expect to gain from\nthe Union, whether they\u2019re students\nwho take their club very seriously or\njust want a bit of fun and to socialise\nwith new people. During this time\nI\u2019ve built a solid working relationship\nwith the members of the Sport Imperial team. I feel this relationship is very\nimportant because the role of DPCS\nrequires strong links with the department to obtain maximum benefit to\nboth parties.\nAs DPCS I intend to:\n\u2022 Work for ALL members of ALL\nclubs and societies in OUR Union\n\u2022 Improve the link between our Union and Sport Imperial\n\u2022 Re-assess the way new clubs and\nsocieties are formed\n\u2022 Give clubs and societies more opportunity to promote themselves\n\u2022 Fight to retain free gym and swim\nfacilities for all students\n\u2022 Bring competence and consistency\nto our Union\nFor an organised, well managed and\nfun Union \u2013 VOTE JESS DPCS!!\n\n"
