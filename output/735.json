    "content": "A Complaint\nI Dear Hugh,\nII read with interest Luke\nI Walkers opinion article on\nacademic affairs. Relieved,\nI as I am, that there is\n| someone on the Guilds\nI Exec who claims to\nI represent students, I am\n| left with one question, what\nI has he actually achieved?\n1 What have any of the\n| Academic Affairs Officers\nachieved? There are still\nir rel event courses, lecturers\nwho can't communicate,\nI and staff promoted because\nI of research rather than\nI teaching. Has no-one\nI noticed that all these\nI committees that our\nI 'representatives' sit on only\nI function to keep the\n| students quiet. Year after\nI year the Union has asked\nI for lecturers to go on\n1 communication courses,\nI and what has happened?-1 NOTHING.\n1 Carl Burgess and Luke\n|| Walker are away this week,\nat a conference in Belgium\nwhich is being paid for by\nthe Union, but I'm sure\nthey'll reply to this letter\njust as soon as they get\nback.\nPete Wilson\nAn apology\nThanks to Luke Walker for\nsetting me straight on my\nmisgivings about the\nstudent ques it on n aire that\nI he, Carl and others went to\nI a lot of the trouble to\norganise. My greatest\nreason for complaint was\nthe conviction that I had\nnot been sent the results of\nthe first questionnaire. In\nfact I had been sent them\nin good time, but had 'filed'\nthem in such a disorganised fashion that it\nwas only when I came to\ncheck for the third time,\nlast Saturday, that I found\nthem, I feel that while my\ncrit is c is m that the\nquestionnaire was biased is\nstill valid, this alone does\nnot justify my Opinion of\ntwo weeks ago. I made this\n| objection known, at a meeting of the\nUndergraduate Studies\nCommittee working group\non Student Needs, and\nI should have let it rest.there.\nII would, however like to\n1 state that the reason I don't go to some meetings is\nbecause I am not told (or\nat least I don't think I am!)\nthat they are going on.\nAlso, it is quite true that I did receive a copy of the\nsecond ques it ion n aire before it was circulated to\nDep Reps, but only in fact\nabout one hour before.\nThis was apparently\nin ve vi table due to the\nshortage of the time before\nthe next working group\nmeeting.\nLuke is also correct to\nsay that he does more work\ntowards Academic Affairs\nwhich I appreciate is very\nconstructive. Most of what I do is talk to students and\nthink, trying to isolate more\nfundamental problems\nwhich cannot be\nimmediately tackled. If you\nthink, this sounds ill-defined and waffle y, that's because it is! There should\nbe an example of this\nelsewhere in this week's FELIX (and others in\nprevious issues).\nFinally I would like to say\nthat Jane Ryder has had\nnothing at all to do with my\nopinion of Luke.\nWith sincere apologies to\nLuke and Carl\nPeter Klemperer RCS AAO\nA Correction\nDear Hugh,\nAlthough not wishing to be\npetty I think I should\ncorrect a small point in the\nnews item refer ing to me\nlast week, which may have\narisen from a misunderstanding between\nmyself and the news staff. I did not deny being involved\nwith the removal of the\nGestetner, my complaint\nwas about the abusive\ntreatment I received from\nCarl Burgess. It was later\nbrought to my attention\nthat Carl was under\nconsiderable pressure at\nthe time and the matter\nnow appears to have been\nsettled amicably. I suppose\nI should thank all the\npeople who seemed intent\non taking my case to heart,\nbut I would rather they\ntook a more rational\nattitude, especially in view\nof the number of potential\ncrises facing the Union at\nthe present time.\nThank you\nMark Cottle\nTechnology not\nthe Problem\nDear Sir,\nThis may seem like a con tradition but I agree\nwith most of the points\nraised by Peter Heap\n(letter's last FELIX) and\nMark Field (Opinion, FELIX\nbefore). However I do feel\nthat Peter has missed the\ne sence of Mark's article.\nThere is no doubt that\ncertain aspects of\ntechnology have been\napplied in a destructive\nmanner. Technology has\ndeveloped in to a tool\nwhich has the power to\ndestroy the world, if not by\na big bang then by slow\nerosion. However this tool\nis not self-determining, it\nhas no mind of its own.\nDecisions as to what\nshall be done with\ntechnology are made by\nsociety. For far too long\n. scientist and engineers\nhave distanced themselves\nfrom such decisions, being\nunaware and unconcerned\nas to the consequences of\ntheir action. All too often\nthe pathetic a cry 'Oh, thats\npolitics, I'm apolitical' is\nheard and accepted as the\nnormal way to think,\nespecially here. This\nattitude is not only\ndangerous but naive.\nPolitics is about people\n(not just political parties)\nand without any interest in\npeople, what point can\nthere be?\nMy point is that yes,\ntechnology has been used\ndestructively but that is a condemnation of the user\nnot the tool itself. It is up to\nyou what you do with the\nknowledge and skills that\nyou a quire here (or attempt\nto anyway). You don't have\nto follow the example of\nthe legions of morons who\nare only concerned with\ntheir own little world.\nTechnology has the power\nto change the world, are\nYOU going to let it be part\nof the problem or part of\nthe solution?\nlain Smith\nMech Eng 3\nYou are\nthe solution\nDear Hugh,\nPeter Heap (last week's letters) wrote about the use\nof technology to 'deprive\nmillions of their jobs and\nmake their lives\npurposeless', to 'pollute\nand destroy the\nenvironment, kill people\nand cause other nefarious\neffects'. He was making the\npoint that 'technology is a bad thing'.\nHe seems to view\ntechnology as something\nwhich has its own\nmomentum, the results of\nwhich are inevitable.\nI disagree with this.\nTechnology is not\nautonomous or neutral, it is\ndirected by the values of\nsociety. Factories were not\ncreated because\ntechnology demanded\nthem, factories were\ncreated to control people\nand their work, and the\ntechnology developed to\nstrengthen this control.\nTechnology has been\ndeveloped in such a way as\nto take power away from\npeople (both in capitalist\nand communist countries).\nIt has been directed to\nmake weapons. It has\nlargely been controlled by\npeople that will not feel the\neffects of resource\ndepletion or pollution s. Technology itself is not a bad thing. It is a useful\ntool.\nAs scientists and\nengineers we must use that\ntool in appropriate ways\nwhich can lead to greater\nquality of life for people,\nwithout pollution or over-exploitation of resources.\nOur Technology and our\nway of life must not\njeo pardi se future\ngenerations or continue the\nruthless exploitation of the\nThird World which we have\nleft underdeveloped.\nScientists and Engineers\nhold real powers. I have\nheard many IC students\nsay that politics and world\naffairs have nothing to do\nwith them. I think that this\nis ridiculously naive.\nI agree with Mark Field\nthat Technologists are\n'essential members of\nsociety'. We must use our\neducation appropriately!\nYours,\nJ Michaelis\n(Appropriate Technology\nSociety Chair)\nSilwood Ball\nBooking Now\nOpen\n\u00a340 to RCSU\nbefore end of\nterm.\nWednesday 12 March FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Taig Over\nChristine Taig\nJackie Pierce\nDave Co Iley\nChristine Taig will be next year's Imperial College Union\nPresident. She beat J Martin Taylor after reallocation of\nthe other three candidates votes. Jackie Pierce is the\nnew Deputy President and Dave Colley is the new\nHonorary Secretary.\nThe election for\nPresident was close.\nBefore reallocation Ms\nTaig had 566 votes, Mr\nTaylor had 332 votes, Chris\nStapleton had 192 votes,\nJames O 'Shea had 121\nvotes and Paul Merckx\n(aka Dobbin) had 90 votes.\nMr Merckx was thus\neliminated. After the\nsecond reallocation Mr\nO 'Shea was eliminated and\nMr Stapleton was\neliminated after the third.\nThe final reallocation left\nMr Taylor with 476 votes\nand Ms Taig with 681\nvotes.\nMs Taig told FELIX last\nnight that she was\n'res on ably surprised' with\nthe result. She added that\nshe did not think in a years\ntime people would think\nthey made the wrong\nchoice. She said she was\ndiss a pointed with the low\nturn-out bearing in mind\nthe work put into publicity\nby the candidates.\nMs Pierce won the\nelection for Deputy\nPresident comfortably. She\nreceived 967 votes while\nPaul Shanley received 164\nvotes. The election for\nHonorary Secretary was\nwon in an equally\ncomfortable way. Mr Colley\nreceived 825 votes\ncompared with Michael\nNewman's280 votes.\nMs Pierce told FELIX\nthat she was 'over the\nmoon, John'. She looked\nforward to 'a good working\nUnion next year'. Mr Colley\nsaid he felt 'really good'.\nHe said that 'I now have to\nget down to doing the\nthings I promised in my\nmanifesto'.\nNew Sabbaticals\nChristine Taig may be the\nbest thing to happen to this\nUnion in years. She has a lot\nof ideas about how the Union\nshould be changed. If she\nmanages to implement them\nthen Imperial College Union\nmay become relevant to\naverage students. She lacks\nexperience, though. The\nperformance of people like\nRoger Preece who have been\nelected to posts when they\nhave little experience of the\nUnion shows that you need\nmore than ideas, you also\nneed a lot of ability and\nsupport. Christine seems to\nhave the enthusiasm and\nability necessary to implement\nher ideas; I hope I'm right.\nDave Jones must make sure\nthat FELIX next year forces\nChristine to keep her\npromises. If she does he must\npraise her and if she doesn't he must attack.\nJackie Pierce and Dave\nColley were always likely to\nwin their elections as the\nstandard of the opposition\nwas very low. It is sad that a union as big as ours can only\nprovide one decent candidate\nfor 3 out of it's4 sabbatical\nposts. If Jackie and Dave\ndon't succeed it will be\ndifficult to criticise because it\nis very unlikely that their\nopponents could have done\nany better.\nResults U GM Make sure that you turn up\nfor the Results U GM. There\nare elections for several\nimportant Union posts.\nThey're important so turn up\nand vote.\nFree Wednesday 12 March No 735\n\n"
