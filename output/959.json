During this\ntime I have discovered that he\nalmost never sleeps, a qualification\nvital for Felix editing. Life with him\nis never boring, always colourful\nand full of surprises. I know he will\nbring all these attributes to the pages\nof Felix, and I believe that there is\nno-one better for the job'\nMark 'Trig' Jackson, C& GU\nVice President.\nI 've been writing for Felix since the\nr je girin ing of 1991, mos dy under the\npseudonym Lise Yates, and I 've\nedited the music pages since\nDecember 1991, reviewing,\ninterviewing and pasting-up.

List regular\nFELIX EDITOR\nEver since my ingenious escape\nfrom the Biology Department in\nNovember 1991, I have gained\nrefuge from the Felix office. But\ninstead of just running around in my\nwheel and eating and sleeping, I have been watching the editor\nperform the day to day to task of\ncompiling Felix. Being editor seems\na fairly easy job, with the added\nperk of unlimited caffeine although\nI will need plentiful supply of\ncheese. This will be my salary:\nCheese and coffee. I require no\nmoney since not many shops accept\ncash from a white mouse. Bastards!\nSome of you may be thinking that\nI have not the required stamina to\nput in the long hours needed to\nevery other task involved in the\nproduction of Felix.\nThis is what I want to do next\nyear... v \u2022 A weekly london section,'\ndetailing the various bargain stores,\ncheap eateries, and assorted other\njunk in the areas of our lovely city,\nspreading out from Kensington and\nPaddington to the outer reaches of\nLondon.\n\u2022 To encourage more input from\nclubs and societies, to keep students\ninformed of the amount of activities\navailable to them.\n\u2022 To negotiate for an office in St.\nMary's, equipped to enable students\nthere to contribute, something that\nwill never happen while Felix\nremains trapped south of Hyde\nPark.\n\u2022 If it's legal, I 'll print it. If it's not,\nmeetings separately. Make the\nsection more readable.\nClubs and Societies. Cover special\nevents. Give more details of sports\nresults. Advertise future matches.\nUnion.

This has been a long-running problem. Solutions\ninclude a second delivery or\nincreasing the number printed.\nI 'll think about it.\n\u2022 To try, and I know everyone says\nthis, to make Felix a more open,\nfriendly place to be.\nIf you want to know more, either\ncome to the hustings, or accost me\nin Felix, the bar, or anywhere else\nyou see me - just look out for my\nhat. If not, be sure to use your vote,\nand be sure to vote for Ian Davies.\nCheers\nPRINT UNIT\nThe Print Unit is mainly used for\nprinting Felix, but it is not used to\nits full potential. By public ising the\ncost of the facilities, it would\nbecome more accessible to students.\nPrinting for societies is at cost, so\nit is cheaper than external\ncompanies. By highlighting this,\nmoney could be saved.\nABOUT ME\nI am a third year physicist and have\nbeen involved with Felix for the last\ntwo years. I am Features Editor this\nyear and was Co-Editor of the last\nHandbook and Alternative\nProspectus, so I have experience in\nproducing publications and working\nto deadlines. I can use most\nequipment in the Felix Office and\nPrint Unit. Having worked part-time for the last three years in a print shop, I have experience in\ndesign, layout and running a printing business.\nWhiskas the Mouse proposed by Jonty Beavan\nsuccessfully produce a quality Felix\nevery week but let me assure you,\nthe hours that have been spent on\nmy wheel were not to kill time. Oh\nno, they were toning up my muscles\nand preparing me for the job.\nAlthough this years Felix was\ngood, it could be better. The\nMusic pages need less photos,\nmore quality reviews and possibly\na new editor while the Features\nthat are often long and boring need\nto aimed at a more wider audience,\nfor example, us mice. The What's On pages look absolutely shite with\nthe appeal of a mousetrap and badly\nneed changing. There also needs to\nbe more Opinion pages with a limit set on the length of each letter\nand the RAG and Union pages\nwill have to go; a complete waste\nof space. The News pages are very\ngood although Declan Curry will\nhave to improve if the quality is to\nbe raised to new heights.\nSo vote me, Whiskas T. Mouse,\nfor a year of Felices you'll never\nforget!\nRebecca Land proposed by Stuart Rison\nPage 4\n\n"

IC played\nagainst teams from NorwayTromso, Norway-Oslo, University\nof Queensland\u2014Australia,\nUniversity of Essec\u2014France, the\nnational team of Iran, University of\nAberystwyth\u2014Wales, University of\nSterling, Scotland and the\nMGIMO\u2014Russia.\nOur team was by far the most\ninternational, with members from\nCyprus, England (2Vi members),\nGermany, Greece, Japan, Norway,\nPortugal, Spain, Venezuela and the\nUSA. The excitement began upon\narrival at Moscow airport where\nour bus was 'arrested' and held up\nfor one hour while our driver was\nthreatened with a gun. Finally,\n'connections' enabled us to get to\nthe Olympic village where we\nstayed. We were greeted by a committee of friendly (?) native\ncockroaches. By the end of the\nweek, most of them were given a name by Ines by which time Nellie\nhad been convinced to refrain from\nkeeping watch. Our first meal\nconsisted mainly of Russian mineral\nwater (Vodka) and very different\nfoods. A number of people put into\naction the diet plans they could\nnever fulfil in London; others just\nate. Favourite substitutes for food\nwere chocolate, Vodka, vitamin\npills, Vodka, cake, Vodka,\nNurofen, glucose, Vodka. They\ntried hard to please us in every\naspect but the Russian canteen food\nwas difficult to cope with while the\nfood in restaurants was first class\nincluding caviar and champagne.\nPage 10\nMy Grandad's long johns During the week, we visited the\nKremlin, The Red Square, the\nPushkin Museum, the Moscow\nState Circus, the Bolshoi Theatre\nand two famous markets; Arbat and\nIzmailevo. We found Russian\narchitecture very interesting\nespecially Natasha who took loads\nof pictures of corroding reinforced\nconcrete. She kept telling us it was\nfor her Phd but she got so excited\nabout it that we wondered. The\nunbearably low temperatures of\n\u201413 \u00b0C made .nearly all our team\nmembers buy one of those\nextremely fashionable Russian hats.\nAlso acquired were medals,\nuniforms, Vodka, caviar, chess\nsets, Matrioschakas and only two\nAustralian t shirts (sorry Nelly), no\ncaps, you had to sleep with an\nAustralian to qualify for that.\nOn the basketball front, our\nwomen strolled through the initial\ngames. The only challenge came in\nthe final against the Russian team\nwhere we lost after fighting very\nhard against the Russian 'Ice\nWoman' (see Olympics). The lack\nof height in our team was\ncompensated for by sound technical\nabilities (Pia's jumping, Natasha'sb ivo t and Nellie's sharp shooting).\nWe ended up in second place after\nthe Russians who defeated\neveryone.\nThe men secured a third place\nvictory in an easy game against the\nRussian team after having lost\nagainst the Australians and the\nIranians. Our men showed their\nexcellent offensive play in the\nmatch against the Iranians but were\nlater to lose after their opponents\ntook advantage of gaps in our\ndefence and shifted to the 'run and\ngun'. Impeccable shooting and good\nteam play by the Iranians ensured\nyet another close victory at the\nfinals against Australia.\nLenin, Stalin,\nUp and over!\nFelix 959\n'eat ure26 February 1993\nIn typical Imperial College\ntradition, we tried hard to keep up\nwith the Russian drinkers. Monica\ncontinuously gave performances of\nPortuguese songs and gymnastics if\nshe could stand up long enough.\nInes and Ralph concentrated on\nstrengthening international relations\nwith the Russians while Annette\nwas hiding from Alexie who tried\nhard to improve the GermanRussian relations.

    "content": "News\n26 February 1993 Felix 959\nTurner turmoil\nIn a highly controversial move, the\nRoyal Holloway College has this\nweek sold its masterpiece, a Turner,\nto the John Paul Getty Museum in\nCalifornia, for \u00a311 million. This\nhas led to the resignation of one of\nthe 25 members of the ruling\ncouncil of RHC.\nThe Turner was part of a collection of 77 paintings\nbequeathed to the College by\nThomas Holloway, the College's founder. The College's action has\nbeen felt to be against the wishes of\nthe donor. Professor Geoffrey\nAlderman, who resigned from the\nruling council in protest said, 'such\nsales are a gross and unforgivable\nbreach of trust'.\nAs a result, the College looks set\nto lose a collection of a thousand\nhistorical books. This hoard\nincludes 2 Shakespeare folios and\nthe earliest English printing by\nWynkyn de Worde. Mr Christopher\nFoley, Managing Director of Lane\nFine Art, decided 12 years ago to\nleave the thousand books to the\nCollege in his will. Following the\nsale, he has written the RHC out of\nhis will, leaving the amassed works\nto his sons.\nRoyal Holloway College looks\nset to sell another two paintings\nwhich are expected to raise another\n\u00a39 million, towards an endowment\nfund for the maintenance and\nrefurbishment of the College. The\nprincipal, Professor Norman Gowar\nsaid, 'Naturally we are sad that we\nhave had to make the sale at all, but\nthe cost of preserving Thomas\nHolloway's main benefaction left us\nwith no alternative.'\nTory MP Judith\nChaplin dies at Mary's by Ian Davies\nJudith Chaplin, the Conservative\nMP for Newbury, died at St Mary's Hospital last Friday. Mrs Chaplin\ndied following complications\narising from routine minor surgery.\nA Cambridge economics\ngraduate, Mrs Chaplin became John\nMajor's Political Secretary when he\nsucceeded Nigel Lawson as\nChancellor of the Exchequer. When\nMr Major became Prime Minister\nin 1990, Mrs Chaplin remained as\nhis Political Secretary. She resigned\nfrom this post in March 1992, and\nCatering \u00a3]4 million short\nSouthside Bar yesterday.\nby Gareth Light\nNews Editor\nThe Imperial College Catering\ndepartment has lost approximately\n\u00a3450,000 over the last financial\nyear it was revealed this week, and\nmay be related to the financial\nmisunderstanding that closed\nLinstead Hall's bar this Tuesday.\nThis department has had a history\nof financial difficulties and in an\nattempt to rectify the situation, Mr Simon Westerman was appointed\nCatering manager two years ago.\nThe service to students, in spite of\nthis, has remained under constant\ncriticism, and competition from the\nICU's bar, Da Vinci's, has done\nnothing to aid their plight.\nSouthside bar has reputedly lost in\nthe region of \u00a325000 so far this\nyear, some 7 per cent down on their\nprojected income.\nThe College's Bar and Catering\nAdvisory Committee has\ncomplained to ICU about there\nbeing unfair competition due to the\nnumber of 'happy hours' and other\npromotions available in the Union\nBuilding which displaces trade from\nSouthside. Allegations as to the\nmotives behind the closure of\nLinstead Hall's bar earlier this week\nbeing an attempt to curb this\ncompetition appear unfounded. As\nMr Westerman is a licensee of all\nthe hall bars, the financial errors\nthat initiated the closure may reflect\non him personally and his future\nlicence tenability. Mr Westerman is\nnot in direct control of these bars\nand so the closure may have been\njustified by caution, if in this case\nunfounded.\nGordon Marshall, in overall\ncontrol of catering, has been\nrumoured to be interested in\noffering the college's contract out\nto private tenure - possibly to ICU,\nbut Rodney Eastwood of the Bar\nand Catering Advisory Committee\nhas said that 'There is no intention\nof going outside' of the college for\nthese services. This does not\nexclude ICU.\nIn an interview with Felix, ICU\npresident Chris Davidson told us\nthat 'ICU, in it's present form, is\nincapable of undertaking such a huge contract due to it's size. It may\nbe possible in ten years time, but\ncertainly not now. Over the issue of\nSouthside's loss of custom, Mr in that year's General Election, she\nwas elected MP for the safe\nConservative seat of Newbury, in\nplace of the retiring Sir Michael\nMcNair-Wilson. Mrs Chaplin had\na majority of 12,357 over the\nLiberal Democrat candidate. No\ndate has yet been set for the by-election, which must take place\nwithin the next three months.\nThe Prime Minister, who said\nMrs Chaplin would have had a 'wonderful career', was saddened\nat the loss of 'a dear friend and a trusted advisor'.\nNicked\nAn attempted bicycle theft was\nstopped in Imperial College last\nFriday 19th February.\nThe incident took place after a bike\nwas left next to a van full of Police\nbehind Central Libraries. On\nobserving the theft, the police\nquickly apprehended the young man\nas he was making his escape.\nLater, Terry Briley, Deputy Head\nof College security, said he was\npleased at this 'active reduction' of\ncycle theft in College. Mr Briley\nadded his thanks to all the people\nwho had cooperated during the\nMountbatten Services at the Royal\nAlbert Hall last week.\nDavidson refused to be drawn\nexcept to say that 'ICU was not at\nfault.'\nRoger Pownell, Southside's manager, refused to comment on\nthe size of the reputed losses, but\ndid say that 'Southside is\ndesperately in need of\nrefurbishment,'and that 'the\nrecession is also a major factor in\nany losses ensued.'\nMr Westerman, who is currently\nat home on holiday, was unavailable\nfor comment. However, Linstead\nbar was reopened this Tuesday with\nthe Catering Department reputedly\n'eating their hats' according to one\nLinstead Re-app.\nPage 2\n\n"

    "content": "Believe\nPRESIDENT Rachel Mountford proposed by Nicky Fox\nI am a third year Civil Engineering\nstudent, although most of you will\nprobably know me better as the ICU\nRAG Chair.\nThe Job\nThe Union president's job is\nbasically one of organisation and\nrepresentation. Within the Union\nthe president oversees organisation\nof the union and its staff and\nofficers. Within college, the job\nbecomes one of representation of\nthe student body. By sitting on\nvarious college committees the\npresident ensures that student views\nare put across and student\nrequirements fulfilled.\nMe\nDuring my time at college, I have\ngained a lot of experience in the\nunion. I have held several positions\nof responsibility, the most notable\nbeing RAG Chair, and have sat on\nCouncil, UFC and the Working\nParty on Voluntary Membership.\nI 've also organised numerous events\nover the last two years.\nMy Ideas\nI aim to make this union, the union\nyou want by:\n1. Continuing the work started this\nyear in opening up the union to the\nstudents.\n2. Actively finding out what you\nwant from us.\n3. Working to provide the services\nyou want.\nOther ideas I have include:\n1. Creating the post of Catering\nOfficer to help overcome problems\ncaused by the new Health and\nSafety regulations. This would be\nof great use to overseas clubs\nwanting to serve food at events, and\nat Carnivals.\n2. A review of sabbatical posts to\nmake them more relevant to the\nstudents they serve and more useful\nto the clubs and societies they help.\nI am standing for Union President\nbecause I think I have the right\nattitude and experience to do a good\njob for all Mary's and IC students.\nI intend to do the job to the best of\nmy ability and for the benefit of the\nstudents.\nPRESIDENT Andrew Wensley proposed by Paul Holmes\nMy name is Andy Wensley and I want your vote come election day.\nPeople may recognise me from\nworking behind the Union bar,\nhowever I have also helped to run\nclubs, the financial side of our\nUnion, aside from being the Dep\nRep for Maths. Due to this\nexperience I was asked to help\nreview our Union and recommend\nchanges.\nThe job of ICU president\ninvolves liaising within the Union\nand College on matters such as\nacademic affairs, overseas students,\nsport and finance; being the public\nface of our students to visitors,\nwhether they be from industry,\ncharities; coordinating the 'arms' of\nour Union, facilitating good\ncommunication and initiating\nchange.\nThe greatest change that students\nface is Voluntary Membership. If\nwe do not change now, we will all\nlose out, clubs and societies lose\nfunding, Union services may be\nlost. If we start changing now, we\nwin a Union offering services and\nevents that we all want.\nMy experience puts me in good\nstead to serve our students and aid\nchanges needed. I am easy to work\nwith, however I would not 'toe the\nCollege's line' but would work\nwhere ever possible to further\nstudent interests.\nNot promises that can't be kept,\nbut general policies for next year\ni) Greater communication on Union\nactivities and events around IC and\nSt. Mary's ii) To keep bar prices as low as is\npossible\niii) To continue investment in the\nunion building, from the toilet\nfacilities and Ents lounge to\ninvestigating a permanent 'night\nclub'\niv) To improve the service of union\noutlets, wherever possible and to\ndevelop shop outlets on the\nwalkway\nI am standing because I believe\nthat I would do a good, unbiased job\nand create a Union that serves all\nIC and St Mary's students.\nCheers, Andy DEPUTY PRESIDENT David Goddard proposed by Sarah McCarthy\nElection manifestos tend to be all\nthe same - someone telling you what\nthey think you want to hear in order\nto get your vote. They normally\ncontain various promises, often\nones which sound good but are\nimpractical, which they hope you'll\nforget after the elections are over.\nAs manifestos seem to be pretty\nobligatory in these elections,\nthough, here's mine:\nI'm currently a third-year physics\nstudent, planning a career in\nresearch. I have done a fair bit over\nmy time here for the Union, and I currently work as a Union Steward,\nin addition to other positions. I'm afraid I'm not a committee hack -I 've sat on a number, and would be\nlying if I told you that I found them\ninteresting.\nIn reality, the people who do\nmost of the essential running of the\nUnion are the permanent staff, and\nI plan to work with their experience\nand knowledge. I believe that\ncontinuity is important, and wish to\nbuild on the successes of the past\nand prepare more for the future,\ncorrecting any problems that occur\nalong the way. This includes\nincreasing the value for money of\nthe trading outlets (while still\nkeeping them financially viable),\nincreasing the attractiveness of the\nUnion for all students (including\noverseas students, postgraduates\netc.), ensuring fair, and good,\nfunding for clubs and societies, and\nfurther improving the Union\nsecurity arrangements.\nI haven't the space here to\nelaborate further, so please read my\nflyer and feel free to have a chat\nwith me.\nProposer's bit:\nDave has set himself realistic\ntargets for next year, and he is one\nof the easiest people to get on with\nthat I have ever met, so I will put\nmy neck on the line and say he will\nDEFINITELY be the best man for\nthe job.\nPage 2\n\n"

For the first time, IC Third\nWorld First has decided to diversify\nits many activities and try\nfundraising.\nWhat is Anti-Poverty Action?\nThis campaign was started by\nstudents in 1979 with the aims of\ntackling the root causes of poverty\nand injustice. It does this.\n1. by directing financial support\nto grass roots projects\u2014not just in\nthe Third World, but also within\nBritain\u2014offering immediate help.\n2. by education and campaigning\nin Britain\u2014offering long term help\ni.e. through change in government\naid policies, debt cancellation, fair\ntrade relations, human rights, and\nenvironmental protection.\nWhat can you do?\nYou can help by joining the AntiPoverty Action scheme. IC Third\nWorld First will provide you with\nthe Bankers Order Form, you\nsimply have to fill it in.\nWe are asking you to commit a minimum of \u00a31.50 a month to AntiPoverty Action. \u00a31.50 to you could\nbe a drink and a packet of crisps.\nTo the people you are supporting\nit's the opportunity to get basic\neducational and medical resources,\nand to carry out important\nenvironmental and development\nwork.\nWhere will the money go?\nHalf goes to the educational and\ncampaigning work of Third World\nFirst (the national organisation not\nthe IC group). For this you receive\nat least three mailings a year\u2014with\nnewsletters, publications, campaign\nupdates and information on the\nProject which you have chosen to\nsupport.\nThe other half goes directly to\nsupport a Project of your choice.\nThe projects are concerned with\npeople fighting back against\npoverty, injustice, and\nenvironmental destruction. Of the\n6 or 7 projects which you may\nchoose to support IC Third World\nFirst will be focusing on one project\nin particular, but if you would\nrather sponsor another project, then\ncome along and see us to find out\nwhich projects Third World First\nhas links with.\nWhich Project is IC TWF\nbacking?\nWe are focusing on a women's health and literacy project in India\nsponsored by Third World First and\nOxfam. This is a community based\nproject concentrating its efforts on\nworking with women and children\nin the slums of Mysore, a large city\nto the south of Bangalore.\nThere will be a display in the JCR\nall week providing a glimpse of the\nwork of the project. Also a worker\ninvolved with the project will be\ncoming to speak on Thursday 4th March.\n-Where do I sign up?\nIf you are fortunate enough to live\nin Prince's Gardens, then don't call\nus we'll call you! On Monday AntiPoverty Action leaflets and forms\nwill be distributed around halls of\nresidence. On Tuesday evening\ncanvassers will be calling round to\ntalk about Anti-Poverty Action and\nto collect any forms that have been\nfilled in.\nThere will be a stall for others\nwanting to sign up in the JCR every\nlunchtime from Monday 1st to\nFriday 5th March.\nMaking a difference has never\nbeen so easy, so if you do give a damn, join Anti-Poverty Action.\nThe Japanese experience\nOn Saturday March 6th, The IC\nJapan Soceity will be taking part in\nJapan Night, organised with the\nJapanese Societies of UCL, QMW\nand Goldsmith's Colleges. It will\ntake place at Paul's restaurant on the\n4th Floor of the UL U building. It\nwill be an ideal opportunity for any\nnon-Japanese student to meet face\nto face with the Japanese people and\nculture. The festivities begin at\n7.00pm, when we will be offering\neveryone a taste of both traditional\nand Modern Japanese cuisine, from\nmaki-sushi and miso soup to\nchicken kara-ape and Yaki-soba.\nLater on there will be a demonstration given by IC Karate\nClub, showing us the way of the\nempty hand. This will be followed\nby a Kendo (bamboo sword\nfighting) demonstration. This is a sport based on the old sword\nfighting techniques of the Samurai,\nwarriors of the feudal age.\nThroughout the evening, we will\nhave Karaoke available. Literally\ntranslated Karaoke means 'empty\norchestra' and is one of the more\nunusual aspects of modern Japan\u2014\nCome and see the normally quiet\nand reserved Japanese sing to their\nhearts' desire or you may even want\nto impress your friends with your\nvocal talents, not!\nWe also hope to be able to do a Japanese style Blind Date, based on\nthe TV programme 'Neutron!' by\nthe comic duo 'Tumels'. This has\na totally different style from the\nEnglish Blind Date, a major\ndifference being that there is an\nequal male to female ratio. For this\nevent, the 'contestants' will be\ngiven a badge with their personal\ndetails and allowed to mingle. This\nis an opportunity for them to talk\nand get to know each other but not\nin the biblical sense, yet! At a specified time, all the females will\nline up on the stage facing the men.\nEach guy, in turn, then approaches\na girl of his choosing and basically\nasks her out. At this point any other\ncontestant who also likes this girl,\nis given the opportunity to woo her.\nThe girl will then have to decide on\none of them or neither. The\nremaining contestants continue and\ntry and win someone's heart. Any\nsuccessful couples will be given a prize and hopefully romance will\nblossom!\nThe tickets for Japan Night are \u00a34\nand are available at the Japan\nSociety social gatherings at 12pm on Wednesdays in the ante-room of\nthe Main Dining Hall (level 1,\nSherfield).\nFree Gig\nAs you may or may not know ICU\nJazz and Rock club has been staging\ngigs in the Union Lounge every\nother Thursday for some time now\n(though this is the first time I 've got\nround to writing about them). Note!\nThese gigs are FREE, right under\nyour nose, and, not wishing to\nshatter your preconceptions or\nanything, but some of these bands\nare rather hot (but Poddy will not\nbe able to verify this!). This time,\nThursday 4th March, 8.30pm, we\nhave Hermits Hat (Smiths and\nDylan in a folk y blender), some\npeople who sound like All About\nEve or something and we finally\nprogress to Tasmanian Devil.\nICSF-The Exorcist\nThis coming Monday, ICSF is\nproud to be showing the single most\ninfamous horror film ever. The\nExorcist starts with Regan\nMacNeil, a young girl with an\napparently und i agno sable illness.\nAfter medical help is found to be\nfutile, Father Damien Karras, a Jesuit priest, is called in. So begins\na rollercoaster ride of satanism,\npossession, an incredible test of\nreligious belief and lots and lots of\ngreen vomit. Not for the squeamish,\nit sparked a furious debate on\ncensorship laws that has lasted right\nup until the present day: as a result\nof this, it is incredibly difficult to\nsee it in this country. The film was\nbased on William Peter Blatty's bestseller, of which about thirteen\n(!) million copies have been sold\nworldwide. It was directed by\nWilliam Friedkin, who went on to\ndo The French Connection,\nCruising, The Guardian and\nRampage, and stars veteran actor\nMax Von Sydow, who featured in\nseveral Ingmar Bergman films,\nFlash Gordon, Never Say Never\nAgain and the Oscar-winning Pelle\nthe Conqueror and gave another\ngreat performance for this. It's notable for its use of Mike\nOldfield's original 'Tubular Bells',\nwhich sold extremely well, partly\nas a result and also boasts\nextraordinarily good special effects,\nincluding one actor encased in\nprosthetic rubber by Dick Smith\n(The Godfather and The Hunger)\nfrom the neck up, which\nremarkably few people have ever\nnoticed.\nThe screaming starts at 6pm in\nChem Eng LT1 on Monday. Entry\nis \u00a31 for members whilst\nmembership is just \u00a33 and includes\nthe first event entry fee. If you're\nlikely to throw up, then don't bother\nand remember\u2014you have been\nwarned!\nPage 12\n>\n\n"

The ship is\nhijacked by two psychotics - the\ncommander of the ship itself and\nanother SEAL guy, who aim to\nsteal the ships nuclear arsenal and\nthreaten all-out nuclear war. So\nRyback, aided by his kitchen\nassistants, fights back.\nThis is your prototype big budget,\nfeel good, mind-numbing\nentertainment movie. It has all the\nnecessary and sufficient ingredients\n- the martial-arts expert good guy\nwith a sense of humour and a firm\nchin who's acting talent consists of\nRoger Moore style eyebrow\nwiggling coupled with a impressive\nsneer, the bit of skirt in the form of\nErika Eleniak playing a Playboy\ncentre fold who stunningly\novercomes her fear of weaponry\n(fh a ar,f h aar) to save Ryback's life,\nand the wavering py s cho path( Tommy Lee Jones) who leaves you\nin no doubt he's the bad die. Add\nlots of large explosions, plenty of\nmachine-gun fire, a good bloody\nunarmed combat scene and a tense,\nmelodramatic finale, et voila, a guaranteed box office success.\nAralia Elegantissima.\n\u2022Out now in London.\nTheatre\nStarting Here, Starting Now Being a musical revue this was a collection of songs and therefore the\npoor plot commonly associated with\nBroadway musicals was thankfully\nabsent.\nm mw\nUnder Siege.\nThe songs in the first half had the\ncommon theme of love with all its\ntrials and tribulations. It involved\nsome exceedingly humourous and\nacute observations especially those\non the true relations of couples in,\n'I don't believe it'. After the\ninterval the show became a little\ntedious, some songs were obscure\nand the humour began to fail. The\ncast however did an exceedingly\ngood job, complete with actions and\nL_ - - _ - \u2022:\u2022 \u2022;\nStarting Here Starting Now.\nall, one could have been on\nBroadway. This small theatre made\ntheir roles even more demanding\nand with only three of them, there\nwas no room for mistakes. It was\na well performed piece and if\nmusicals are your scene\u2014well go\nand see it.\nSophie.\n\u2022 Link Theatre, Holborn Centre,\n3 Cups Yark, Sandland Street,\nThe Invisible Man The Invisible Man is a comedy, a magic show and a musical - all in\none. It is about the naive inhabitants\nof a small English village in the year\nof 1904. Everything is peaceful,\nuntil, on a dark, winter's night, a mysterious man, covered from head\nto toe in clothes and bandages,\narrives. He claims to have had a serious accident, and this seems to\nsatisfy the villagers until a series of\nburglaries occur. In a spectacular\nscene, which would impress even\nthe great Paul Daniels, the vicar\nwitnesses an attempted robbery of\nhis week's collection by an unseen\nspirit. The plot, thankfully not too\nsimple, unfolds when the stranger,\nin yet another spectacular scene,\nunveils his bandages.\nThe show is written and directed\nby Ken Hill who has a string of\nimpressive productions behind him.\nPaul Kieve designed the illusions\nwhich are, on the whole, quite\nsuperb. The acting is brilliant,\u00abnd\nespecially good were Caroline Bliss\n(as the School Mistress), Brian\nMurphy (who starred in George and\nMildred), and Philip Newman.\nThe show starts off much like a pantomime and without much of an\ninvolved storyline. Via brilliant\nspecial effects, it progresses into a more sei o us and complex world of\ngreed, violence and obsession with\npower.\nThere seemed to be mixed\nfeelings about the show among the\naudience. \"The best show in\nLondon,\" said one man, who was\nscornfully looked upon by another.\nBut for me - better than a kick in\nthe teeth.\nBill\n\u2022 Vaudeville Theatre, Strand\nWC2, Charing Cross Tube.

His\nstyle is a mixture of realism and\nabstraction that tries to draw upon\nthe subconscious, with emphasis on\nthe hands and legs because those\nwho have neither of them, strive\nhard to make their lives meaningful.\nHis compositions, colours, titles,\nimages all play a specific function\nin bringing an intelligible meanings\nand messages about African beliefs,\nideas, values and knowledge.\nThe works include; The Twin\nMother (Iya Ibeji), Announcement\n(Ikede), Under one Umbrella and\nPride of Puberty.\nThe exhibition is presented by ICU\nThird World First, ICU Nigerian\nSociety and the Imperial College\nConsort Gallery and will be held at\nthe Imperial College Consort\nGallery, South Kensington between\n8-22 March 1993 between 10.00am and 6.00pm Mondays to Fridays\nwith a private view on Monday 8th March from 6.30- 8.30 pm.\nPak Soc\nFilmSoc-Friends\nToday at 5.15pm in the Union\nDining Hall, you are invited to\nattend the Pakistan Society Iftar\nDinner.

This is sure to be a fiery\noccasion\u2014one not to be missed at\nany cost.\nNext week, FilmSoc, is proud to\npresent one of the most popular\nfilms from last year's London Film\nFestival, Peter's Friends. Starring\nmost of the 'luv vies' of the British\nthespian establishment, directed and\nproduced by Kenny Branagh, it is\nthe ultimate exercise in how to\nmake a movie for all those Thirty\nSomething and Big Chill junkies.\nThe extremely witty script, cowritten by Rita Rudner and loaded\nwith marvellous one-lines, is about\nthe reunion of six friends from the\nCambridge Footlights. Ten long\nand eventful years have passed\nsince they graduated and headed off\nin separate directions to encounter\nwhat life has in store for them.\nPeter (Stephen Fry) has frittered\naway the promises of his youth and\nis unable to commit himself either\nprofessionally or personally. Roger\n(Hugh Laurie) and wife Mary\n(Imelda Staunton) have been\nshattered by a family tragedy.\nMaggie (Emma Thompson) has\ngrown ever more eccentric, sharing\na solitary existence with her cat.\nThen, there is Sarah (Alphonsia\nEmmanuel) who has been involved\nwith a series of married men and\nwhose latest suitor is Brian (Tony\nSlatery). Finally, there's Andrew\n(Branagh) and his wife Carol\n(Rudner) who have both achieved\nfame in Hollywood.\nThese old friends gather at\nPeter's house for New Year's Eve\nand re-evaluate their lives. Despite\nmuch laughter, there are quarrels,\nrecon il at ions, and drama.\nThe acting from such talent, as\nexpected, is first rate with Time Out\nsaying that it reached\n'extraordinarily emotional depths'\nand Branagh once again proves\nhimself to be one the best British\ndirector/actors around. The film\nalso features a soundtrack from the\nlikes of Queen, Tears for Fears,\nSpringsteen and Eric Clapton.\nPeter's Friends will be shown in\nMech Eng 220 at 7.30pm on\nThursday 4th March. Entry is 90p for members and \u00a31.90 for non-members. Remember that\nmembership is now only \u00a33.50\nwhich includes your first film free.\nFinance Election\nThe Annual General meeting &\nElections for the Finance o cie ty were held on Wednesday, 17th Feb.\nThe ex-chairman arrived a bit late\n(20 mins), obviously we all\nunderstand his grief about leaving\nhis post. The Finance Soc. has had\naround 420 members making it the\nlargest Society at IC, but it was\nquite disappointing to see only a handful of them turn up for the\nelections. Last year the elections\nwere quite successful because of the\nbuffet after the event. Next year we\nshall definitely consider holding a buffet to improve the attendance.\nThe meeting started with a talk\ngiven by the out-going chairman\nAmer Hasan. He gave the members\na detailed review of how the society\nstarted two years back, how it has\nprogressed within that period and\nthe potential it has to go even\nfurther (the speech was well\ndetailed - he went on for an hour\nor so !!). Elections were held after\nthe Chairman's report. Speeches\nwere made and questions asked.\nThis was followed by a very\ntouching speech given by Maana\nRuia on behalf of the leaving\ncommittee to thank their chairman\nfor all the things he had done for\nthem and the society without whom\nthe society would not be where it\nis today. All was over within three\nhours resulting in the emergence of\nthe new chairman, Salman Ali.\nWe are still looking for committee\nmembers who would like to join our\nfriendly, lively and hard working\nsociety. Joining the committee\nrequires no previous experience.\nMeetings are held every Tuesday at\n1.00pm in the Huxley Building (Rm\n410). Members from all\ndepartments are welcome to the\nmeetings and to join the committee\n(first years are more than\nwelcome). Being a committee\nmember has a few pri vele ges and\nit's not all work.

The\nMuslims criteria for action is not\none of individual benefit, but rather\none of accountability. The Islamic\nsystem has been implemented for 13\ncenturies providing peace and\nsecurity for the non-Muslim and the\nMuslim alike. What Islam has to\noffer is not what we see in the\nMiddle East nations today; rather\nthese nations are enacting the orders\nof their Western masters and\ncompromising the Islamic way of\nlife.\nGraciously, the ignorance of the\nConSoc is forgiven, and the invite\nDear Jonty,\nJust a word on the accusations of\npusillanimity levelled against\nGareth 'Beit back and don't give a shit' Light last week.

Mistaken Identity\nDear Jonty,\nI was very dismayed when I turned up at the Felix Office to\ncollect two Metallica videos I had\nwon in a competition to find that\nthey had disappeared. After some\ninvestigation I found that your\nmusic Editor Ian 'Poddy' Davies\nhad already given them away to a friend.\nI find this behaviour extremely\nirresponsible, especially since the\nperson concerned is standing for\nFelix Editor, so should show some\nreliability and if Felix runs a competition it has a right to make\nsure the prizes are available.\nYours,\nKS Rushbrooke, Physics 3.\nLobotomy-o gram statement\nDear Jonty,\nWe have felt ourselves obliged to\nput pen to paper following a number\nof allegations which have been\nlevelled at C CU and ICU RAGs.\nThe first of these concerns the socalled 'Frontal lobotomy-o grams'.\nThese were not organised by the\nRCS Union as was announced in\nyour editorial of Felix 957. They\nwere not advertised as part of the\nusual RAG Week japes because\nthey were not a part of RAG Week,\nnor condoned or organised by\nRAG. They were carried out by a small group of individuals, using\nthe RAG name in an attempt to get\naway with a cruel assault.\nThe allegation in Cat's Eyes that\nsomeone involved in RAG or the\nCCUs must take responsibility for\nthe illegal O grams is ridiculous.\nWe are no-more responsible for\nthese acts than the managers of\nBritish Gas would be for a mugging\nby a person masquerading as a gas\nmeter reader to gain access to\nsomeone's residence. We are very\nconcerned by the occurrence and\nwould have done everything in our\npower to stop.it, had we known\nabout it in advance. Further, we\nwill support fully any victim who\nchooses to make a complaint.\nThe second point needing\nclarification concerns the C&G union Hit-Squad. Members of the\nHit-Squad are given careful\nguidelines regarding the placing of\nflan s on victims (not in the face of\ncontact lens wearers, place the flan\ndon't hit people hard etc.). The HitSquad officers themselves also set\nrules concerning the maximum\nnumber of hits any one student can\nreceive to prevent vindictive,\nmultiple attacks. This year RAG Week saw an individual receive\nmore than this maximum number of\nhits. This was not due to hit-squad\nofficers who, rightly, refused to\ncarry out the extra hits, but down\nto a couple of frauds who decided\nfreelance (and free) hits were the\nanswer. Donning their own lab coats and masks, they went out and\ncontinued their attacks on the\nunfortunate student.\nBoth of the above incidents could\nhave been a lot more serious than\nturned out.

Imperial\nCollege Security apparently failed\nto respond to calls for assistance\nfrom the Stewards. The incident has\nprovoked another internal review of\nUnion security.\nThe series of attacks took place\nin a running brawl which developed\nearly on Saturday morning. Just\nafter 2.15am, an unidentified young\nmale was hit a heavy blow to the\nrear of his head. His assailant, a5'4\" male, was removed from the\nbuilding by Simon Govier, a Union\nSteward, and Dominic Wilkinson,\na sabbatical officer. The male, who\nwas not believed to be a student,\nwas asked by Mr Govier to show\npositive identification. He refused\nto do so, and mumbled that he was\na guest of the band playing in the\nEnts lounge. It is now thought that\nthe assailant was admitted to the\nUnion Building after signing the\n'paid guest list'.\nWhile the man refused to produce\nidentification, a group of five others\ngathered around Mr Govier and Mr\nWilkinson. Scuffles broke out when\nthe man grabbed Mr Govier by the\nthroat. Mr Govier called for\nassistance over his security radio,\nand he and Mr Wilkinson tried to\nstop the group from leaving the\nQuad.\nAs the group moved towards the\ncentre of the Quad, Steven\nNewhouse, another Union Steward,\narrived to assist Mr Govier.

Mr Newhouse tried to restrain one of\nthe group attacking Mr Govier, and\nwas himself punched. Another of\nthe group attempted to strike Mr Newhouse, but he was restrained by\nMiss Land, who was physically\nthreatened. Mr Wilkinson moved\naway from the gates, which were\nthen opened. The group escaped\nthrough the open gates. Mr Newhouse's glasses were damaged,\nand Mr Govier lost his watch in the\nscuffles.\nThe incident was reported to\nUnion authorities on Monday\nmorning. As a result of an internal\nsecurity review, the 'paid guest list'\nhas now been scrapped. This list\nallowed friends and guests of the\nband, or guests of the Union, to\nattend functions for the normal fee.\nThe current 'signing in list', where\nUnion members can sign in two\nguests, and reciprocal members one\nguest, is unaffected.

Miss Rachel\nMountford, a third year civil\nengineering student and this year's rag chairperson, claims that a concerted smear campaign has been\ndirected against her by unspecified\nmembers of college.\nMiss Mountford alleges removal\nand defacement of election publicity\nposters, with her sexuality being the\nspecific issue targeted. Independent\nwitnesses later confirmed that there\nwas homophobic propaganda on her\nposters in Selkirk Hall. Miss\nMountford herself, and other\nindependent witnesses have also\ncited examples in the Royal School\nof Mines and Civil Engineering.\nSimilar handwriting has led to a single culprit being suspected over\nthe incidence in Selkirk.\nWhen asked if he thought the\ncandidate was being victimised,\nDominic Wilkinson, Honorary\nSecretary (Events) said there was no\nevidence of a deliberate smear\ncampaign, adding that 'Anybody\nfound sabotaging or defacing\nposters will be dealt with as\nappropriate'. Mr Andrew Wensley,\nMiss Mountford's opponent in the\npresidential election, said he had\nbeen aware of the anti-gay lobby,\nand that trying to make a political\nissue out of sexuality was\n'disgraceful'.

    "content": "Reviews\nEntertaining Mr Sloane Set completely in the sitting room\nof a house straight from the 50s, this\nplay is a classic comedy from Joe\nOrton. With an ostensibly\nstraightforward plot, it really is\nquite amazing how complicated\nthings can get! Mr Sloane is\nemployed by Eddie, and then lodges\nwith Eddie's sister, Cathy and\nDadda, their elderly father. An interesting development is the\nsexual relationship that builds up\nbetween the frumpy, middle-aged\nCathy and the young and vibrant Mr\nSloane, which also involves\nmother/son role playing. Twists and\nturns in the plot reveal past events,\nand show that history has a habit of\nrepeating itself in the lives of three\nof the characters and leads to the\ndeath of the fourth. A completely\nunexpected ending gives the play an\nextra edge.\nA lot of the humour leaps up from\nbehind and grabs you by the throat,\nthe jokes being enhanced by\nexcellent acting from the cast. Mr Sloane was very convincing as a pet u lent young man, filling the\nstage with his easy going charm and\nthe occasional outbursts of violent\nanger. Cathy showed her loneliness\nand her search for love well. She\nasks Mr Sloane if she disgusts him\nin the same breath as saying ' My teeth are inthe kitchen in Stergene!'.\nAs such a classic everyone should\nsee this play at least once in their\nlives and here is an opportunity to\ndo so. And the male nude photos in\nthe 'Art' gallery ('pornography'\ngallery) may attract a few of you to\nthis theatre as well.\nLaura.\n\u2022 Greenwich Theatre, Croams\nHill SE10, Greenwich BR.\nHandel Truth be known, I'm not much of\na Baroque fan, nor Classical for that\nmatter. For sure, it is all very\npretty, complete and to the greater\nextent, logical and perhaps it's partly this predictability, coupled\nwith the lack of outright passion\nwhen compared with such as\nTchaikovsky, Rachmaninov or\nBruckner which fails to entice me.\nWhatever my preferences, I sacrificed my love for the\nRomantics in the name of art last\nTuesday and trundled off to the\nBarbican to witness a concert of\nlesser known Handel works,\nperformed by the English Chamber\nOrchestra under the charismatic\nleadership of Sir Charles\nMackerras. The Concerto a due cori\nDon Pasquale Donizetti's comic opera seems fated\nto 'For-all-me-family...' treatment.\nTwo painful productions in as many\nmonths have left the jaunty operetta\nreeling from ridicule.\nFollowing in the hobnailed-boot-prints of the English Touring Opera\nthe ENO takes the 'amenable'\napproach i.e. suits, sunglasses and\nSesame Street subtlety. Don\nPasquale is a so uf le light comedy of\nmanners em beli shed with some\nenchanting, if pre dic able tunes.\nHere the 'young-lu r vers fool-an-old\nduffer'-plot is mercilessly flogged\nto flippancy by frenzied eyebrow\nNo.2 in F is a compilation concerto:\na sort of slightly-less-than-greatest-hits of Handel (for instance, the\nthird movement is also known as\n'Lift up your heads, O ye gates'\nfrom the Messiah) orchestrated for\nstrings (with continuo), oboes (and\nbassoons) and horns, and resulting\nin a delightful array of competitive\ndisplays between the three sections.\nMackerras' strongest attribute has\nalways been (for me anyway) the\nability to exact the kind of quality\nsound from an orchestra in the\nmanner of say, Karajan or Abaddo,\nand it is a delight to both watch and\nlisten to. On this occasion his jovial\nnature coincided with that of the\nmusic, and the musicians were most\nevidently enjoying themselves, as\nwell as putting on a fine display.\nThe showpiece was the oratorio\nwhich old George Fredrick\ncomposed in 1740, just before he\nstarted work on the Messiah.\nL 'Allegro ed il Penseroso is based\nFelix 959\nwaggling.

Furthermore, I have\nexperience as a Union Steward and\nas Treasurer of a number of\nsocieties. Specifically, I would like\nto address the following areas:\nCommunications:- The\ncommunication between the\nstudents and the Union is\nnotoriously bad. The 'Reaching\nOut' stalls which I organised\ninitially in the JCR and imminently\nat St. Mary's are the first steps to\nproviding easy access for students\nto the facilities.\nCollege day:- The Union has not\nyet reacted to the new college\nhours; leaving students with wasted\ntime whilst libraries, labs and the\nJCR stalls close during the students\nworking day. I shall press for better\ntimetabling and improved services\nacross the campus.\nAccommodation:- With fiascos\nsuch as student accommodation\nduring the holidays I shall be taking\na firm stand against ill-thought-out\nintentions of the College\nAccommodation Office.\nVoluntary membership:- The\ngovernment wants to put an end to\nthe NUS and in the process they\nmay well stop funding for many\nsocieties.

It has become\nincreasingly apparent that current\nI.C. events although adequate (and\noccasionally excellent), are still in\ndire need of some added zip,\nsparkle and pizazz, and a new minty\ntaste. I feel that being approachable,\nfriendly, responsible, committed\nand experienced, I am the candidate\nto deliver this \"bottled Pontin's atmosphere\".\nAs Honorary Secretary I will be\nin a position to decide who gets\nwhich rooms in the Union when,\nand for how much. I will use this\npower to ensure only the best, most\nsought after events are staged.\nI believe Ents should be\naccountable to you, and in order to\ngather your opinions I will make\nmyself available for questions and\nsuggestions at least once a week to\ntry and get some feedback.\nI will try to address the problems\nwith the current Friday night Union\ndoor charge and admission policies,\nand investigate the legal difficulties\nthat CCUs and societies have in\npreparing and selling food.\nI will revive the CCUs' now\nnearly extinct role in staging events,\nencouraging joint events with Ents\nand Rag to diminish the risks of\nmaking a large loss.\nI will encourage wide publicity\nfor ALL ICU events.

    "content": "Opinion\nFelix 959 26 February 1993\nEditorial\nWeeks weak\nRecently it came to my attention\nthat new residents in Weeks Hall\nhave been informed by their\nwardens that they should not have\ntoo many people in their rooms.\nThis is fair enough, order must be\nupheld, but as long as you have a group of friends around to chat until\nfour in the morning and, provided\nthey don't make too much noise, no\none really minds.\nWrong. The reason that you are\nnot allowed to have large numbers\nof people in your own room in\nWeeks Hall is because you and your\nmates could end up crashing\nthrough the floor, and into the room\nbelow. If there are only a few\npeople present, it is advised that you\nall stay away from the centre of the\nroom to avoid the same effect. The\nbuilding was designed badly, with\npoor materials, and has been left\nstructurally unsound with the\nBeit\nBack\nLies, Damn Lies and Election\nManifestos.\nElsewhere in this edition of Felix\nyou will find the manifestos from\nthis years candidates. If anyone can\nremember last year's manifestos,\npoor you. However none of them\nhave yet carried out any of their\nelection promises except Dominic\nWilkinson and Jonty Beavan, who\nfulfilled part of theirs.\nAnd this year?\nRachel Mountford (President)\nfailed to build on Rag's previous\nbrilliant year. Rag Week came and\nwent. A new post of catering officer\n- is this an attempt to grab OSC\nCat's Eyes\nRachel, FL EM. Trig\nWith regards to your letter on page\n4:\n1) It is not ridiculous that someone\nin RAG or the RCS must take\nresponsibility, since it was due their\ninadequate statute that the two\nincidents occurred.\n2) I feel the need to point out that\nthe other person that was\nlobo tomis ed was none other than\nLorna Mountford, younger sister of\nRachel. This was done for two\nreasons: The first is that the three\nmentally insufficient lobo to mists knew that she would not mind,\nproblems never fully corrected.\nIf this rumour is even remotely\nnear the truth, every member of the\nCollege Estates division should\nimmediately commit themselves to\nritual suicide. It is ludicrous that\nsuch a deathtrap be allow to contain\nany human being, let alone those\nwho are meant to be the cream of\nour scientific and engineering\ntalent. That this state of affairs has\ngone on for so long is unforgivable,\nand should be rectified\nimmediately.\nI cannot deny that this sort of\nchange costs money, but compared\nto the alternative it would be a pittance. If one such floor-crashing\nincident were to occur and the event\nhit National Press, we might as well\nwind up Imperial College right\nthere and then. No self-respecting\nparent would let their child go to a University that allows such floor-hopping antics, neither would a Phd\nvotes?\nAndrew Wensley (President)\nalways has much more to say for\nhimself. He is predictably short on\nproposals, but yet again there is the\nold favourite of cheaper beer prices.\nWill he be able to move away from\nthe shadows of his mentor Chris\nDavidson and be his own man?\nHighly unlikely.\nDavid Goddard (Deputy\nPresident) lacks the deep\nbackground knowledge to do a good\njob for the first 6 months. By which\npoint its too late to do anything. Yet\nagain no real proposals, but then\nagain that is not surprising as he\nonly wants to be sabbatical to spend\nanother year drinking with his RCS\nbuddies.\nHugh Eland (Deputy President)\nhas the knowledge to do the Union\nbeing the RAG Secretary and hence\nwould take no legal action. The\nsecond is that they did not want to\ngive the impression that I was\nsingled out for an attack.\n3) Speaking for Gareth Light: the\nterm 'RAG Twat' applies directly\nto specific Raggies who happen to\nbe tw at s, as well as the fake Raggies\nwho performed the lobotomies.\nSex\nIn yet another study on human\nbehaviour, it seems that women\nwho take the soft approach when\narguing with men, are more likely\nto change the minds of their male\nsparring partners. The study,\nhighlighted in last weeks JVew\nScientist (issue 1861), concludes\nthat women must get their views\nstudent want to spend his thesis\ndescribing how to survive Imperial\nCollege halls. This ridiculous\nsituation cannot continue for one\nmoment longer, and for those of\nyou who live in Weeks, tread\ncarefully.\nTechnophobia\nThis has not been an easy week for\nthe Print Unit. Taking a casual\nglance around the office, it is much\neasier to Count those pieces of\nequipment which have seen fit to\nend the week in a condition that\ncould be described as 'working'. As\nyou may have gathered, I am\nmaking excuses; Felix will very\nprobably be late this week, and you\npoor souls could be reading this\nissue on Monday as opposed to the\nnormal early Friday morning\nlecture filler. For this, my Lords\nand Masters, I can only apologise\nand point, ever so 'um bly, to the\npieces of equipment that faithlessly\na good service, but will his pussyfooting and middle-of-the- road\napproach work with College\nmanagement?\nMaxim Jalil, now the only\nHonorary Secretary (Events)\ncandidate, is best known for his\npersonal interest in testing\nchemicals and his ability to sign his\nproposer s signature. Vote NEW ELECTION and bring back\nDominic.\nIan Davies (Felix Editor/Print\nUnit Manager) otherwise known as\nPoddy, Lise Yates and probably a few other names that we don't know\nabout, has a rather chequered past.\nControversy surrounded his time as\nMusic Editor and it was also\nrevealed on IC Radio this week that\nhe has faced a college disciplinary\ncommittee.\nacross with warmth, plenty of\nsmiles and 'gentle hand gestures',\n(though what hand gestures the\nwomen used were not described).\nTWAT\nGareth Light, News Ed., has no\ngrip on reality. Read the letter from\nG. McCord. It's very weird that\nGareth writes anonymously in Beit\nBack, admits to it the week later,\nand then writes a letter another\nweek later, using a pseudonym, in\nwhich he slags himself off. Beware\nof him, he is dangerous.\nRAG Cartoon\nMega thanks and praise to the guy\nwho sent in the RAG cartoon on\npage 9. I love it. It's excellent.\nPLEASE do another one.\nbroke down on the long-suffering\nmembers of staff who work in\nFelix. Normal service could be\nback at a later date.\nCredits\nNews: Gareth, Declan, Andrew,\nJacob, David Spooner. Reviews:\nSara, Mario, Richard, Phil,\nKristine, Ian 'Poddy' Davies,\nDavid, Glyph.

This was finally printed\nin the Christmas Issue.\nThe St. Mary's Block Vote.\nEach year most candidates spend\nthe month before the Election at St\nMary's drinking in their bar and\npretending to take an interest in\ntheir bit of Imperial College. The\nhypocrisy of this situation is\namazing as once elected they forget\nall about them again. The block\nvote is decided by the performance\nin the hustings and how the voters\nare told to vote at the ballot box.\nThe hypocrisy with which the\nelection system runs is disgusting.\nViews expressed in this article are\nnot necessarily shared by anyone.\nRed Jeans\nI have been asked to write\nsomething about anyone who wears\nred jeans (or burgundy for the more\ncolour conscious among you). To\nhelp me, I interviewed a member of\nthe college. Mr. X( no relation to\nMalcolm), as he wishes to be\nknown, claims that they look vile,\nrepulsive and nauseating, and worse\nwhen someone is wearing them. He\nsaid 'I don't know what drives\npeople to buying a pair, they're\nhideous!' After removing the\nsickened look on his face, he added\n'You have admire such people, they\ncertainly have courage.'\nMr. X is currently taking evening classes in design and fashion.\nP.J.

    "content": "SPONSORED\nPARACHUTING\nDirty Deeds\nYou will all, of couse, remember\nlast term's spectacular Dirty Dozen\nchallenge, where a dozen eager\ncollectors from each hall set out to\nraise as much do sh as humanly\npossible in twelve hours. Mind you,\nI'm sure there are some people who\nwould rather cast a veil over the\nwhole event - namely the team from\nFalmouth Keogh, who staggered off\nwith a barrel of beer at the end of\nthe day. If you think you could raise\nmore than they did, have more fun,\nor think up some stunt far sillier\nthan doing the conga in Covent\nGarden, then Dirty Dozen Two is\nfor you.\nTeams are already being mustered,\nready for the event, on March 6th. Secrecy appears to be everything,\nas Hall Reps are keeping their ideas\nclosely guarded from the\ncompetition. As yet, only the\ndestinations and intended\nben if ici aries are known, although\nwe may be able to publish more\ndetails closer to the time: Fisher are\nintending to go to Dorking and\ncollect for BIBIC, whilst Garden,\nWeeks, Tizard and Southwell are\nall staying closer to home and using\nthe Cystic Fibrosis Trust's Greater\nLondon licence to collect in the\ncapital. Falmouth Keogh are\nreturn ng to the scene of their former\ntriumph, Guildford, where they will\nbe collecting for the Leonard\nCheshire Foundation, which helps\nseverely physically and mentally\nhandicapped people to live fuller\nand more independent lives.\nBernard Sunley are planning to\ncollect for WWF N at the QPR v Norwich match, and Willis Jackson\nwill be in Reading collecting for the\nsame charity. Linstead and Selkirk\nare both keeping their destinations\nunder wraps for the time being, but\nif you fancy joining in with the team\nfrom your hall, pop along to your\nHall Rep and force them to tell you\nwhat they're up to!\nRunning ahead\nOn April 18th, when most of us will\nbe enjoying our Easter break and\nhaving a well-earned rest, one crazy\nstudent from IC will be running the\nLondon Marathon. Alex Taverner\nhopes to complete the gruelling\ncourse in under three hours, which\nwould put him amongst the top two\nhundred runners. To get a place in\nthe race, Alex has had to undertake\nto raise a thousand pounds for Tusk\nForce, a charity primarily\nconcerned with protecting the\ndwindling populations of elephants\nand rhinos, and so far he has\nobtained pledges for over \u00a3600. So\nif you see Alex around college,\nplease sponsor him, and watch out\nfor him on the telly on the day!\nFree tickets\nFree tickets for Suzanne Vega, all\nDeacon Blue tour dates, Bon Jovi,\nJesus Jones and Sting are available.\nSimply turn up at the Rag meeting\nin the Union lounge on Friday at\nl pm for more details.
