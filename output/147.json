What are the reasons for- this? Firstly, the- intense enthusiasm of a few' j people has carried the'dumb- beast' ( u one member of the Union calls the vast ,\nis of uninspired and uninterested its\nent a) along,as usual,but with more succ e ii this year than last. Secondly,aa I.C,j becomes bigger,* few sore people sufficiently interested in the Union to SO Ut\ne thing hare come along.\nWe now have the stupid position of a few people providing the hard work to make sure that the rest have some wher ti eat,somewhere to drink and somewhere to chase women*ie the Saturday night hops, Imagine the uproar that would ensue if\nthe refectories were shut down or the\nbar closed or the Saturday night hope were term Ar^ ted.\nIt would appear that very few people are prepared to take an active part in\nthe affairs of the Union, and of those TOO1 do a number have lost their sense of proportion. In fact,T.C. be eos an more like a technical college every year. What the future holds,who can say? butt the outlook is not bright. We may aa well abandon\nourselves to our fate.NUS say be able to do something about it,but I have a feel inc that their interests are better applied\nto National politics.\nJ.C.| YOUR COUNTRY NEEDS YOU Compulsory National Service was\nintroduced in this country in1938, in order to increase the size of our fig h ting forces at a time whan Hitler was\nthreatening the peace in Europe. However, it was continued after the war so\nthat we oo ul d fulfil our commitments to\nother countries. Five army divisions have been kept in West Germany as part\nof N.A.T.O. Only now is the Government ending compulsory call up. The\nintroduction was fully justified. by the outbreak of war in September 1939.\nIt is the continuation after the war\nthat is to be discussed.\nMany soho ol boys and undergraduates\nthink of National Service as a useless\nbreak in their work and look for ways\nof avoiding it. These boys usually try to obtain employment with a firm engaged\nin defence work, and which can offer\nthem deferment. Some, however, we loom e the opportunity to break away\nfrom home and to see the world. National Servicemen fought in the Korean\nWar and at Suez. Some have seen\nao tion against terrorists in Kenya,\nMalaya or Cyprus.\nIt is generally accepted that\nthe majority enjoy the companionship\nduring National Service and benefit\nfrom the team spirit and discipline. These young men usually leave the\nservice for more mature than when\nthey joined and are more fitted to\nstart their careers in industry. Some\ngain invaluable experience in the\nhandling of men. A few, however,\ndo not fit in, for they resent author-it y and do not like accepting orders.\nThey usually leave with a stronger\ndislike for authority and, unfortunately no answer has been found to\ntheir problem.\nAfter the war, Industry found\nthat it was losing its skilled youth\nto National Service and that most of\nthe better school leave rs were accepting\nemployment with firms engaged in def-eno e work. An apprentice who had been\ntaught a craft would be called up for National Service at a time when he could\nhave started to do useful work for his\nfirm. After doing his service he\nwould not always return to the same firm.\nIndustry disliked t. iis and, it is said, found ways of gaining deferment for its young men whenever possible. however,\nit has now come to be accepted that the\nteam spirit and discipline enjoyed by a youth during his term of National Service\ncan be of benefit to him and that he may\nwell be a better worker for having\ncompleted it. The young men who had\nbeen officers during their National Servi ce were now trained leaders of men.\nThe Government adopted National\nService to increase the strength of the\nForces, but it also had to consider the\noverall efficiency. Much of a Nati on al Serviceman'a time is taken up\nby learning a craft. Their training\nonly becomes of value to the Forces in\nan emergency. Training is given by\nregular servicemen, and this causes\na reduction in the size of the part\nof the regular Forces helping to meet\nthe Country's commitments. For these\nreasons National Service results in s reduction of the overall off i oie no y of\nthe Forces.\nThe type of young man who makes\nthe Foroes his career, is one who taxes\na pride in belonging to an efficient,\nvolunteer organisation. National\nService causes a lowering of efficiency\nand so results in a fall of regular\nrecruitment figures. This is indicated by the growing recruitment figures\nnow that National Service is to end.\nThe spirit must improve when everyone\nin the Forces is making it his career.\nNow that the cold war is not so\nintense, it has been possible to reduce\nour commitments. Forces need no\nlonger be as large as they were. With\nIndustry expanding as it is, it is\nmore important to the country'seo once y to increase the manpower engaged in\nproduction. The Government hopes that\nby doing away with compulsory National\nService, the size and efficiency of\nthe regular Forces je ill increase. It\nwill then be able to meet all its commitments with these regular Foroes,\nand by releasing young men from two\nyears National Service, be able to\nincrease the production of consumer goods,\n\n"

    "content": "ffc LIX PRESIDENT EXPLAINS WHY At the last Council meeting of last term\ncm 21 st. March I resigned as President of\nImperial College Onion. I did this because;\neffectively \u2022.majority of the members of\nCouncil and I disagreed as to what was the\nfunction of Council. I believed and still do, that Council exists to help run the\nUnion and mate decisions that would be\nburdensome and time wasting if they all had\nte me discussed by a full Union Meeting.\nThese decisions should try and reflect to\nthe best of Council's ability what the\nUnion would want; and if the Union at\na Union Meeting makes a decision then\nCouncil's Job is to implement that decision,\nirrespective of whether or not they as\nindividuals agree with the majority decision\nof the anion.\nAt the Council Meeting a member of\nCouncil proposed that the Union's decision\nto affiliate to N.U.S. be sent back for reconsideration. The proposer said in effect, \"You all know what I thin!, of H.U.S.,\" I said it at the Union Meeting,\nlets throw it back.\" Other speakers\nargued that the subject had not been well enough discussed. Before a vote was taken\nI explained to Council what I considered\ntheir job to be, and added that I thought\nthey would be dishonest if they voted for this motion. I said tli at I considered\nthat if the motion on II.U.S. had been defeated and I had proposed it be reconsidered because it had not been fully discussed,\nCouncil would have howled me down. I told Council that I would find it hard to\nrepresent them at the Union Meeting if they\nvoted in favour of throwing the N.U.S. motion back. Mr. I. Callow asked if I would elaborate what I meant by \"finding it hard to represent them j^I refused because\nto have told them I would resign if they\ndid not ap yee with me * would have been\nputting a pistol to Council's head, which\nI had no wish to do.\nA vote was taken and Council decided\nby M+ votes to 7 with one abstention to refer the motion back to the 'Jnion. I then resigned. Two days later Council\naccepted my resignation; this, after I had been told by two members of Council\nthat if I would admit I was in the wrong\nIo ou ld go back. I believe it is what\nthe Union says that must go, not what\nCouncil says; consequently I do hot bel i eve that I was wrong.\nSome people may object tli at250 people at a Union meeting is not enough to\nmake an important decision. No-one is more diss a pointed than I to see so few\npresent, I would prefer many more, but a quorum is200 and provided that number is prese:.t any decision made is, I believe,\nbinding. Also people point out to me\nthat Counoil does warn have the right con-- st it uti on ally to refer back a Union dec-- is ion. This of course is so. If it were\nnot 1 would ruled out of order any disc is sion on Council about referring it back.\nBut Council's right to do this is only a safeguard so that in an emergency or in the light of additional vital information\na Union deo is ion may not be adequate.\nHowever, such a case could not be made on\nthis occasion, nor did any member of\nCounoil try to make one.\nCouncil was fully aware too, that if the Union really were unhappy with the\ndeo is ion to affiliate, a member could have\nsent in a motion berg in,g permission to have\n$he matter redi sousse d. Such a request is\nbound to be granted, no p neh a3 authority\nto do otherwise. Counoil knew this as\nwell as I.I have been proud to hold the oo s it ion of President of ICU., and I thank everyone\nwho has helped me during the two terms I have been in office. Some people have\nsuggested to me that a resignation was too\nbig a step to take on such an issue. I cannot see any other course of action Io ou ld have ta icen.I believe the issue at\nstake to an important one; that is whether\nthe Council runs the Union or whether the\nUnion members do as a whole. To have not\n: Nresigned would have rubber-stamped Council'\ndecision with my approval, something I found mw self unable to do. There is something about 14 people outvoting 183\npeople that revolts me.\nPARENTHOOD MADE EASIER BOOK REVIEW OF THE YEAR I see that someone or other has\ndone it at last - a do it yourself\nvolume entitled \"Do it yourself Parenthood\".\nNow this little book has undoubtedly oom e on to toe market at the right\ntime. As a Book - critic I have my time\nout out reading all the volumes w hio hoc me out each week, but I am really\nglad that this particular work came my\nway just when I was deciding what to\nread next. It made my mind up for me,\nso to speak. Onoe I had picked it up I found it extremely difficult to lay down\nagain. Without a doubt this vol wee is\ngoing to be found next to the Bible and\n'Scouting for Boys' on Mr. Everyman's bookshelf in the years to come.\nDid you know that every child had\na mother and a father? Well I had to\nadmit it shook me - up until the moment\nit was revealed en page 27 of this ex -o ellen t textbook I had taken the word\nof my first sergeant major quite literally - in fact he seemed to think that\nour whole squad had no fathers. I wish\nIo ou ld find out where he was stationed\nnow and I'd send him a copy of \"Do it yourself Parenthood\" so that he could\nclear things up in his own mind.\nAfter all, if you knew that someone was\ngoing through life under a complete misapprehension about a certain sub jeo t,I'm sure you too would wish to help in every\nway you could.\nAll in all, I suppose this book Jut\nhad to he written. How fortunate we in\nthat it has made its appearance in our\nlifetime. But what of the Author? 1\nam going to be quite honest with you,uJ\nstraight away admit that the nan s of\nSybil B. Xenon, had meant met tb inc to \u2022was this work of at t her first book \u2022\nhad I missed other volumes perhaps jut\nas great as the masterpiece is ting in\nmy bookcase in dog-eared splendour!\nIt came as a relief, and indeed a surprise to find the truth about Miss Inn\nNo, she had not written previous vol uw, and yes, this was her first attempt at\nputting pen to paper.\nMy newspaper arranged an inter rie i with Miss Xenon, and in due course I turned up at her suite in the Dorobaittr,\nI knocked on the door and was admitted\nat once by her apron ed maid. \"Mil*\nXenon is expecting you,\" I was toll by the maid, and would I, \"Come this way,'\nI followed the maid and was led into til\nRoyal Suite. In a large double bed\namongst a pile of soft pillows reo lined Miss Xenon. To me she appeared as any old woman would, exo ep t that quite\nobviously her brain must be the sin of a pumpkin in order to be able to writ)\nas she did. She had a long cigarette-holder in her right hand and with her\nleft hand was popping large succulent\ngrapes in to her toothless mouth. \"\nGood Godl\" I thought \"She is eccentric N she must be a genius.\" The maid brou it ta chair to the edge of the bed, and bill\nme sit down. At ono eI begged per s iii a to interview Miss Xenon. She o on unt s with a nod of her blonde wig. Hot oil\nwas she, please, I wanted to know. ?\n8\n,\nWhere was she born I wanted to know. Scunthorpe. Had she ever been in low'\nShe did not know. How did she obtain ta information for her book. Through\n15 x100 binoculars. Where did a he lin\nbefore the book was published? Tlern\ndel Fuego. Did she know her par entity sight? Miss Xenon did not understand ti\nquestion. Did she find Aristotle ati*\nu latin g? They were Just good friend l. What was her job before the wealth fra\nroyalties came her way? She gutted\nherrings.\nIt *as time to leave and as I nut\ngo I thanked her for granting the Inter'\nview. \"Maria, show the gentleman to to t door.\" The maid had half closed the 1\u00bb\nbehind me when I swear I heard kin 7\n8\nyear old Xenon shouting, \"What are yon doing tonight Dearie?\" I sprinted to. lie head of the stairs and slid down the\nbannisters for five storeys. It oo ul d have been dangerous to await the arr is! of the lift l Ah well', we must allot\neccentrics a little licence in their behaviour, and besides, she may' not hen\ncalled out at all. You know a little about the book ill\nI say to you'read it'. You know al if j about the Authoress, and I say to you,\n'forget it'. By the way, there is only one slight omission in this other wii i excellent textbook - Miss Xenon ha a declined to tell the do it you s self parents to get married first. So If you want to be a parent, I urge you to go ti\nthe nearest off - licence and take out a marriage certificate for yourself and partner. Negotiations are in pro gren with a well known engineering firs is ti\nMidlands to produce a do it yourself kit\nwhich should be used in conjunction t it l the manual, and it is expected this till\nbe on the market in time for next\nChristmas, together with a junior Tenia\nof the kit for kiddies stockings. By t. way, the Junior kit will contain a plaits\nstethoscope. As these are habit for nl ii you may wish to take it out sf the box before giving the kit to your child.\n\n"

    "content": "HM.S. PINAFORE Those of us who attended IC ku s ical[ Society'a production last term of the\n^operetta 'HMS Pinafore', one of the most\nI popular creations of the fertile I img i nations of Giibert and Sullivan,\n/ sus tI think ha^e gone away afterwards\nI feeling that at least they had been given\n'omg n if i cent evening's entertainment,\ntnn though there were matters of detail rbi oh they would criticise. Now it may\nbe the critic's task to draw in an as\noen era l and non-commit al manner as possible the overall effect that a certain\nperformance has had, or ought to have\nbed on a particular audience, with an\nli r of profundity which deceives none but\nhimself, or alternatively he may try to\na ke the criticism that he considers the\nire rage man would put forward, but in either a ip roach to the problem he will fill simply be o a use his judgement is lier lt ably subjective and therefore\npersonal. He must therefore write from\nIds own point of view and let others read\nU little or as much as they find in bio, otherwise he will be in the pre diol a ent of the politician who ta as er ted that\nbe would not let his op pinions bias ids\ndecisions.\nGood entertainment though it was\nI this performance was also something more\nl ihl th in the end .has the more lasting| effect in the memory, that is, it was on\nI the Thole executed with considerable\nj skill and artist io competence. It was\nIclear from the open L.g bars of the\n(oTt r ture that the orchestra had gained\ne lot of o on vi de no e in the year since\nthe last Gilvanian production, and as\nthe evening went on, this confluence\ninfected the audience which then had a reciprocal effect on the cast, building\nthe whole into a most lively combination\nof entertainers and the enter tai ned.^ la contrast to the score of ' Iolanthe',\n'pinafore' does not give such great\nscope to solo instruments, so that the\n\u2022or k of the orchestra relies as one\neight say on team work. It is perhaps\nj for this reason that there was so much\nI lore unity among them at times sounding\n|quite professional. It is no reflect i on\nJI themselves, but wouldn't it have been\nbetter if there had been an orchestra\npit built in with the concert hall, so\nthat one did h't feel in danger of being\nought up by an over-zealous first| wi olin is t. Turning now to those on the stage,\none newer knows whether to call them\nlot or s or singers, but this only underlines the fundamental problem besetting\nopera from the very beginning. The\nwi riou so os posers have laid emphasis\n\u2022OKtiaes on the one, sometimes on the\nother aspect, and it is fair to say that\nGilbert and Sullivan have demanded ao on ii der able degree of both acting and\nling ing to sustain interest. Gilbert's libretti usually call for a bit of\nquick and witty tomfoolery at some point\nt the action, and on this occasion it is FELIX provided by the First Lord of the Admira l ty, the Rt Hon Sir Joseph Porter K 'JB\nplayed by Timothy Dhonau, who was\nobviously enjoying prancing over the\nstage and keeping the audience rippling with laughter. This he did most capably.\n_Tt was a_ pity he did not display the\nsame vivacity in his singing which' at\ntimes became confused be o a use of the lack\nof clarity in diction. To sing effectively one certainly needs a strong voice. Under\nthis difficulty labour ed also Richard\nWalmsley singing the part o of Ralph Raokstaw who sang charmingly but who was\napparently finding it hard work to\nachieve the necessary power, a perennial\ndifficulty with tenors. Captain Corcoran (by David Rymer)happily had a voice to mato h his heart and provided\nus with some of the best singing we\nheard. His movements were suitably dign if i ed as be oo ming the Captain of the\nPinafore and altogether his interpretation of the role was convincing.Com-pete ntl y supporting their Captain were\nthe Boatswain's mate(by Robert Adams)and\nDick Deadeye (Richard Hasell) both of\nwhom were very clearly audible and commanded attention.\nAmongst the women,first to appear was\nLittle Buttercup (Helen Barker) who,being\nphysically about half the size of the\nButtercup one is accustomed to,was able\nto put a somewhat new conception, it the\ncharacter across.An instance of this wor th mentioning was Her complete d is a pper a rano e beneath a pile of sailors grasping\nafter her wares \u2014 quite different from\nwhat usually happens in this scene.Her\nsinging was well-polished and charming\nto listen to.Josephine,the Captain's daughter (Lorna Haywood) who,on the ship,\nis the chief close of the trouble\nwas,on the-stage,just the antithesis\nand supplemented her actions by a strong\nand accurate soprano which at \"least on\none occasion brought an encore call from\nthe audience which was thoroughly des-erve d. This encore was only one of many\nwhich were demanded continually during\nthe evening wh i oh was all part of the\neasy cooperation between pit and stage\nwhich is essential in a professional as\nwell as an amateur performance.The dire ot or, Prank Kennard did not always grant\nthese encores,presumably thinking that\neither he or the audience had had enough,\nbut to be in a position to give or withhold these \"extras\"is itself a sufficient tribute to him.\nThe two Choruses were not so accomplished in their singing as one would\nhave expected,in particular the sister s,oo us in s and aunts seemed rather spirit less and their diction was not always good\na serious matter in a work like this.Tb-Sailors were at any rate more vigorous\nbut again mere lacking in unity and precision of expression.I suspect that fin ding themselves on the stage with their\nconductor a dim figure behind the glare\nof the lights^was largely responsible\nfor this. The matter of adequate rehearsal\nis always a thorny one.\nAs regards the other components contributing to the success of the opera,credit must be given to the stage crew for the splendid set they had pro duo ed. This\nwas a good solid pie oe of workmanship,\npossibly the only _fate being the hatch-way,placed centre stage.Even this was so\nrealistic that at least one member of'the\naudience was con via sed she had seen somebody go down it.Unfortunately,the stage\nis small enough, already and suo h an elaborate setup aa we saw only made the use-ful space even less. I would have had not\nso much the impression that the choruses\nwere falling into the wings if this extra\nroom had been available to them. The depth\nof the stage was also out by the ship'a rail, but no doubt there waa some strategic reason for this.The costumes were\nwell designed and the oo lou s s blended\nvery well together.They must have cost\nthe production a good sum of money.\nII\nMention must also be made of.the special\nlighting effects used in the second act,\nwhich though striking,should not have\nbeen allowed to obtrude quite so much on\nthe eye.We were treated to the sight of\nan assortment of clouds drifting across\na full moon,a type of effect which in this technical age is becoming more and\nmore expected,but prior to this,a most\nnovel spotlighting was used, which again\nwes continued too long. It was\nrather perplexing to see Josephine's face flickering in the strong light as\nshe moved about the stage,reminding one\n9f viewing colour slides with a faulty\nillumination.Of course,the answer to this little problem would have been for her\nto remain still, but it is not 30 easy\nto begin altering these things without\ngoing into a matter of production at length\nwhich is not the purpose of this comment.\nIn any case,such suggestions and critic isms would be concerned with details of\nwhat was after all a most successful ef fort of cooperation,the general aims of\nwh i oh are probably comment to producer,\ndirector and critic.Many things have to\nbe taken into account when staging an\nopera in. our college and compatibly with\nthese the society is certainly well up\nto the mark,and it is to be hoped that\nit is sufficiently encouraged to unleash\nits enthusiasm again next year.I should\nbe surprised if it doesn't.J Tripp\nApril1960 GEORGE Born in the chill room of an empty.house,\nFashioned in secret and in haste,\nA hollow fantasy of rods and wires,\nBut barely overlaid with paint on paper\npaste,\nCardboard afoot, with glass wool tail and\nmane,\nHere was a creature of brief destiny and\nfame,\nFor but a few bright hours\nMidst measured music, dancing and\ncarouse,\nAnd yet a challenge to dull thoughts\npedestrian,\nA noble animal, Imperial and equestrian!\nWas e 'er before a fitter horse\nTo grace the Riding Club's festivities?

    "content": "FELIX9 THE National Union of Students ill the major Colleges and Universities \u00abf this country belong to the Nat iq nal Mon of Students, except for Imperial\ntillage, Kings College and Bangor University\nCollege. The functions of NUS are\ndo-fold: firstly, to provide for the\nu press ion of the student view-point, and\nsecondly, to provide facilities supplementary to those provided by the\nindividual student unions.\nr Consider the first of these functions:\ntie expression of the strident view-point.\nJust aa doctors have a view-point on m odio li affairs, and teachers a view-point on\neducation, and boiler makers on boiler i liking, so I believe students have some\nthings to say on student affairs that\nnobody else oo ul d say or is likely to say.\n' Just as a member of any other occupation\nredd be irresponsible if he did not give\nI use consideration to the wider problems\nof his or her particular organisation,\n1101 think that a responsibility is shown\nhy those who advocate apathy or disorganised criticism of student affairs by students.\nIt would be a sad day for this country if ell its students became so irresponsible\nthat they c^ul d not organise an institution for the reasonable expression of their tm view-point.\nFor many years NUS has had a comprehensive policy on student affairs, v kept up\nto date, and agreed on stage by stage by\nits' members, I will quote three exam p lee from this comprehensive policy. NUS\nadvocates a central clearing-house form ivers it y entrance to replace the\npresent oha o tic scramble from one University\nto another without any indication of the\nplanes available. NUS advocates that\nstandardised grants should be given au tdma tic ally upon an entrant obtaining a University pla oe. Fpr years it has been\nrecommending the abolition of the means-te et, NUS has means of making itself heard\nis good as those of any other occupational\norganisation. In the House of Commons\nthere are 5 Vioe-Presidents of NUS: two\nConservative MPs, two Labour MPs and a liberal MP. Lord Pakenham is the VioePresident representing NUS in the\nlouse of Lords. NUS has annual meetings\nwith the education committees of the\nParliamentary Parties and from time to tia e with the Minister of Education on\ncertain specific issues. The Parliamentary\nSecretary for Education recently met\nje aber s of the NUS Executive to discuss\nt look grants. Direct o on ta otis maintain\ned with the local education authorities,\n.'c is t standing committees are maintained\nwith the National Union of Teachers and the\nla soo i ation of University Teachers. The\nUniversity Grants Ccjnmittee mae t the NUS\nta cut ive for a one-day o on fe reno eon oe a year, (When the UGC visit Imperial\nCollege on oe ewer y five y gars they meet apc up of only fifteen students for thirty \u2022unites). In addition NUS organises the\nrr it lng of letters to the press and\nrepresentations to other occupational\norganisations.\nThe effects of this work should be\nassessed in the same way as for any other\noccupational organisation. The number of\nlocal education authorities adopting the\nnational Union's recommendations on\ns in ten ance rates and methods of assessment\nrose from 64 in1952 to 118 in1955, and\nit was asked in1957 by the Ministry to\nsubmit evidence of student expenditure.\nCo, several other ocoa s ions the Ministry\nin requested information\" from NUS, apart\nfrom the numerous representations on the\nbehalf of individual students. In 1955\nthe Ministry of Pensions tried to levy\nf\"at ional Insurance Contributions at\n\u2022self employed' rate f twa post-graduate\nstudents, but after ref n resent ation a by\nNUS and NUS alone the matter was dropped.\nLord Pakenham, the Vioe President of the\nHouse of Lords, was able to arrange for a debate on the means-test, and NUS\ncalled for the support of parents through\na letter to The Times. NUS has campaigned\nagainst the giving of loans instead of\ngrants by local education authorities.\nThe West Riding of Yorkshire was the last authority to give up the practice of giving\nIcons at Jt interest for study purposes\nafter NUS efforts in1957. NUS has fought\nfo arr the award of grants to adult sts s&t mtf c with a fair measure of success. NUS\nactivities gained the point from the L8IR\nthat post-graduate grants should be free\nof the means-test. There is a long list of other instances of the effectiveness of\nHDS and I submit that the record of hard\nmA and u ii liU ii es iJ lT Hr11 bj^NU3 is out of\nnil proportion to the almost non-existent\nefforts of the ICU in this direction. But not only do t dislike the idea\nof ICU o ashing in on others' efforts but\nI believe that members of ICU would\nstand to profit quite substantially from\nthe supplementary facilities offered by\nNUS. Let us now consider this second\nfunction of NUS.\nOn arriving at IC new students would\nreceive a free copy of 'The Students' Guide\nto London'. ICU members would be able to make use of the NUS Travel Bureau and would\nbe provided with free information on\nforeign travel on request. They would be\nable to participate in the student charter\nflight scheme. There is an NUS Hostel in Gordon Street. There is an NUS vacation\nwork\" department, providing information on\nnon-technical jobs and there are the famous\ninternational farm-camps. An 80-page book-let containing advice on choosing a career\nis circulated free to final year students.\nIC would be able to enter the NUS drama .\nfestival and the Observer Mace debating\ncompetition. In addition a number of shops]\nand theatres in the London area give up to20 \u00bb\no concessions to NUS members.\nAs it Chandmal, who seconded me in proposing the motion to affiliate to NUS\nat the last Union meeting described\nhimself as 'a rare bird: an oriental who\nis also a materialist', and to prove it he\nwent on to describe how he had saved \u00a350\nby belonging to NUS. If you vote for ICU\nto affiliate to NUS at the next Union meeting l/3d of the \u00a36 you pay every year to the ICU and the Athletio Ground Committee\nwill go to NUS. I hope that all those\nmembers of the Union who can see a bargain\nwhen it is offered will come to the next\nUnion meeting to endorse the former decision for ICU to take S* s rightful place with\nthe other 89 Universities, and University\nColleges in the National...Unian of.

    "content": "WRY T world M.V ef ugcc J Lear WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO The British effort in World Refugee Year is to be specially\ndirected to help these people:\n1. The remaining 160,000 refugees in Europe ;\n2. The 8,000 European refugees in China;\nI. The million Chlnyt* refugee* in Hong Kong :\n4. The million refugees from Palestine.\n1. The remaining 160,000 refugees in &\nEurope,\nGeographically this problem is the\nclosest to us here in the UK, and perhaps\nunfortunately most of the receipts of\nWET will be spent in an attempt to finally\nsolve this European problem. In reality,\nof o our se, this problem is relatively\neasy compared to the Chinese for example.\nEven so, as a number of students from this\nCollege, who have visited the refugee\ncamps, will bear out, these people and\ntheir children are in a plight with respect\nto health problems and morale. How can\na child who has known no other life other\nthan that of ao amp adjust to the world\noutside? Our efforts, whether monetary\nor in kind can help*.\n2. The 8000 Refugees in China.\nIt is perhaps surprising to find\nthat on the 1st of January 1959 there\nwere over 10,000 European refugees on the\nChinese mainland. Two thousand of these\npeople have since been moved to various\nparts of the world at a cost of approximately \u00a3700 each. Here they have to set\nup life at home on oe more at ease to go\nabout in religious and political freedom.\nThe aged and 111 are to receive life-long\ncare arid medical treatment from Europe\nmainly.1\nThat most of these people were\nsettled and actively engaged in helping\nthe Chinese in spheres of education,\nagriculture etc., makes the situation\ndoubly tragic. For completion of the\noperation, another \u00a32m and the necessary\nvisas are necessary.\n3. The million Chinese refugees in Hong\nHong long.\nThe problem in Hong Kong is different from most, in that the refugees\nare not interested, in fact on the whole\nare violently opposed, to leaving Kong\nKong. This highly over-populated town\nis the \"last\" free refuge for them, and\nmost, presumably wish to return home\nsomeday, meanwhile ,there are the\nproblems of; swi vs s as d atl on. health and\nm FE.UX\neducation. W,U. S. has already done much,\nwork in this latter problem, and student\nr taft is e as spend fj Of E of their .Use teaching in -the co-operative schools ran by\na skeleton permanent staff.It is impossible to assess the total am mount of money required to solve the Hong Kong refugee problem,but any contribution will help to alleviate the most urgent needs.\nV. The million refugees in Palestine.\nOne result of the Palestine conflict\nin 1948, was that hundreds of thousands of\nmen, women and children left their homes\nand lands wh i oh then became part of Israel\nterritory. They took refuge in the\nneighbouring lands of Jordan, the Chasa\nStrip, the Lebanon and Syria. As a group\nthey are mixed in every way; regarding\nnationalities they are mainly Ares,\nwith smaller proportions of Armenians,\nGreeks and other communities; regarding\nreligion nine-tenths are Moslem and the\nrest are Christian; regarding occupations\nthe vast majority are small farmers,\nagricultural labourers and unskilled work-ers. The smaller proportion of well-to-do refugees and others belonging to a profession or possessing any technical skill\nhave settled relatively easily in Arab\ncountries. The greater proportion by far\nare unemployed or can get only harvest\nwork.\nWhen it be o a me obvious that no rapid\nsolution was imminent the fc ner al Assembly\nof the United Nations established UN HWA( United Nations Belief and Works Agency ,\nfor Palestine refugees in the Near East).\nThis organisation has an annual budget of\n\u00a314su Unfortunately U NRW A itself is sure to expire on June 30th1960. Who then will continue these services which\nare so desperately needed?\nIC CARNIVAL DO YOU KNOW YOUR ELEPHANTS? Have you ever studied the elephant?\nElephants are extremely useful and\nintelligent animals. You personally can\nuse an elephant; you carouse it. tO'Win\none of the many fabulous prizes offered at\nthe Carnival Fete. This par fci qu jar Elephant resides at the London Zoo In\nRegents Park. Its name is Rusty, and\nit is classed as an Indian Elephant,\nalthough it actually comes from Ceylon.\nThere is one other piece'of information\nI can supply about this elephant - it is nineteen years old.\nHow can this elephant win you a prize?\n- Quite simple - All you have to do is to\nguess its weight and chest measurements.\nYou can size up the elephant by paying it a \"visit at the Zoo any day of the week, or\nyou dan study a large p hot qg rss ph l4 feet,\nby three feet) which will be on display at\nthe Fete.\nIf anyone knows precisely what part of\nan elephant constitutes its chest will they\nplease let me or the London Zoo know at\nonce. Our present intention is to throw\nthe tape measure_ round the elephant, start\nmeasuring just \"behind the forelegs and\ncontinue measuring at various strategic\npoints along the elephant until we find\nthe widest part. Whether the measurement\ncorresponds to chest expanded, chest contracted or chest normal will be entirely a function of the elephant.\nSince the elephant will be weighed and\nmeasured on Monday morning, due account\nmust be made for Rusty having had a heavy\nweek-end. This Monday morning is Kay the 9th, the Monday after the Fexe,\nand also the weekend of 'The Wedding';\nthat means lots of visitors to the Londem\nZoo and lots of buns for Rusty, so do make\nallowance for this in your estimation of\nRusty's vital statistics.\nMORE STAR St Q ne of the attractions of the\nCarniv si Fete really can be billed as a' star', for it is the representative of the Stars and Stripes; the American Air Force\nBand.\nThis band is the band of the Third\nAmerican Air Force which i3 stationed in\nBritain, and they will be playing for\nperiods of the afternoon. Anyone who has seen this American Band in action will :M \u00bb\nthat their performance is a spectacle wh ii must not be missed. So come along to the]\nCarnival Fete and see the Third American\nAir Force Band.\nYOU MAY HAVE IT SO GOOD BUT..... That is the theme of the Carnival\nProcession, and everyone who has any\nmeans of transport must bring it to\njoin the procession. You may not have\nrealised it but the theme gives plenty of scope for imaginative decoration. Just\nthink of all the things you like in life\n(more than the obvious three if possible)\nand they are capable of being adapted to\nthe theme. Alternatively think of the\nthings (people??) you dislike and they\ntoo can be adapted to form part of the\nprocession.\nThe procession starts in Prince\nConsort Road at 1.45 p.m. on Saturday\nMay 7th and ends, we hope, on the same day, It is possible that parts (small parts?)\nof it may still be proceeding' to Bon\nStreet on Monday morning, but they will he dis-owned as a heretic sect (i.e. you will\nhave to pay v our own 40/-)\u2022 The oha noes of this are small, however, for we do have police sanction for the route and polio e coverage at traffic lights, junctions etc.\nso unless you deo ide to indulge in some final practice for the coconut-shy by\n' potting' policemen's helmets or t raff io lights you should be quite safe.\nThe route includes High Street Kensinj\nton, Earls Court Road, Cromwell Road,\nBrompton Road, and South Kensington, If you think you can pedal that far or that\nthe ' old bus' can make it with ten on board\nthen for you the procession is an absolute\nmust. So get those banners out, find t host ideas that are lurking in your mind, and bring yourself and your veh iole along to\nPrince Contort Road in time to start at\n1.30 p.m. on Saturday 7th May.\nDANCING IN THE QUAD There will be dancing in the Beit\nQuadrangle on the il of J day, Wednesday and Friday evenings during Carnival week. The dancing will begin at 7 p.n \u00ab and\ncontinue until 10.JO p.m. It is hoped that the IC 'Big Band' will be playing during these evening a. What more could you ask?\nGood jazz St Fresh air it Handy Barti\nEnjoyable dancing li And lots of girls!S So dancing at the L. C.o arn in l, "

The\nrao e, over a beautiful, hilly, seven an*\na half mile course was of a very high\nstandard and the team really excelled In\ntar lar j second place to the County team.\nResult. Northumberland and Durham\nCounty tee a56 I.C.57 Durham University\n58. The main reason for this excellent\nresult was a fine run by Tony Larkum\nwho finished second with John Collins\nfifth, the rest of the team finishing\neleventh, twelfth, thirteenth,end fourteenth.\nAfter a day watching the waves at\nWhitley Bay (where J. H.C, and C. R.H. looked just a little too closely and\ngot a little bit wet), we travelled across country to Stran Raer where we\ncaught the Irish Mail to Lame for Belfast. After a brief tour for Belfast,\nwe decided to have s day in the country\ntravelling by the most fantastic railway\nset up imaginable to Warrenpoint. Here\nthe team did some \"hard* training on a nearby 100 foot mountain Clough Llore,\nchasing sheep and falling in gorse bushes.\nOn Wednesday 30th we travelled to\nDublin where, on the following morning,\nwe had a much looked-forward-to visit to the Guinness Brewery but our consumption of samples was restricted on\nCaptain's orders. The reason for this was a3 mile race in the evening against\nCl on life Harriers \"the fastest track in the world\" at Santry. In this race we\nwere narrowly beaten by Clonlife 57\npoints to 50, John Collins talc ing seo on d place with a personal time of 14.27.\nSeveral other members of the team also\nreo or ded personal bests on this beautiful track.\nFriday morning saw the team tra i ning in the teeth of a gale on a fine s stretch of sand and dunes just outside\nDublin in preparation for the rao e next\nday. This,a relay in 6 stages cm of\nvarying length, was the highlight of the\ntour. Every man in the team seemed to give of his best to give I.C.a very\ncreditable seo on d place to Dunore Harr\nHarriers whose team contained four inter nationals, beating Cl on life Harriers\nand Avondale, two more of Irelands top\nFELIX On the boat returning to Un j.^ members of the team playing solo took\non a remarkable reso mbl a moe to ten greer\nbottles as one by one they felt the\neffect of a rough sea on a large tea\nand dashed out on deck \"just to get a breath of fresh air J l\". So ended a very successful and enjoyable tour.\nCRICKET The trials are upon us; 4 0\nfresher s are longing to swing the\nwillow and hurl the leather, to snow\n\u00bb**t they can do. What o an they look\nforward to this season, what does the\ncricket club offer?\nIt offers a varied fixture list, sufficient to satisfy the ill\u2014iris and\nability of every type of cricketer, plus\nii\u2014mi in l spirit and general intention to\nget the ew j daa al possible enjoyment out of\nor ioke t. The 'dangling carrot'held in front of every member of the cricket club\nis THE DEVON TOUR; the mast fantastic 10\ndays of your life,with or is kw t against the\ntop teams la the south-west,et i urinating\nSPORT GOLF TOUR On the last day of March,a team of\neight left the Union by oar for the North.\nOur first fixture was against Durham University, playing sir-s side,and was held st\nthe K>r tb uBbe rl and Golf Club, Goef\u00ab\u00bb\u2022*->.\nThis is said to be the best comas la the\nnorth-east,and certainly it was very tes-ting, threading its way in and out of Newoastle racecourse. In the morning,H. Godfrey\nand B. Noxon won their foursome,and the club\no apt a in, A. JJDix-Perkin,and John Street\nplayed competitively to halve theirs. In\nthe afternoon,we lost the singles,4-2,so\nDurham had won 5i3?, our first set-back.\nThe road to Edinburgh was empty,we\nre a oh edit in the morning,and played at\nGullane in the afternoon,a long,windy,\nseaside course on the south of the Firth\nof Forth.\nAfter taking in Dalsahoy we crossed\ntha Forth and drove to St, Andrew's. On\noar first day we played prat rt ioe rounds\nan the recently opened Old and New courses\nThe links hare run out on a peninsula of\na and hills between the sea and the river\nEesn and provide probably the cheapest\nand beat golf in tha world e Our o apt a in had a latter of introduction to the secretary of the Royal and Ancient,and we\nware privileged to use the fej so u a club-house.

All this and fine weather too,made our stay awa w rab la,e vw n though St,Andrews bast us 9tV4. It waa\ndecided to play wka singles over the Old\nin? tha morning and this meant that wa had\nto win at least 2+ to be able to win the\nmatch on the four after neon four sasses. H. Godfrey and B. Noxon due ly wen,but it was\nleft to M.J. Rycroft at No.8 to get the\nlast,-. Watched anxiously from the club \u2022\nhouse he played a courageous third shot\nto tk s hol s ts a awa the match.

Next day we played Edinburgh at North\nBerwick,in inclement weather,and lost 7i~i This was not surprising as only their best\nteam was available asd l ncl n dad British,\nana Scottish Universities champions.The\nonly half won waa la tha afternoon by N. Look and A, J. Dix-Parkin in a four ball.\nThey returned scores of 78 and 80 respec>t ivo ly. good s acres for 8 hand loa p pars in( renditions of wind and rain.\nAfter a farewell round on. the enures*\nof our choice next a ox n lng( John Street\n\u2022so ring wall an. the short Jubilee course)\nwe made the short run across the\nTay to Carnoustie where we stayed\nthe night, and played next day. We\nwere disappointed with this long\nchampionship o our se which we thought rather\nuninteresting, and wa continued to Aberdeen\nin the af tea no cn. in the game on the County ground against\nTorquay, with all the fac ili tie a that the\nEnglish Slviera can offer.\nDig out those whites! Try your\nhardest for the Devon tour J It's worth\nit.\nHere we put up at a small hotel\nwh i oh served very good porridge and\nwaa extremely 'good valise'. The venue\nfor our match with Aberdeen was Crudeo BIT, a beautiful and almost deserted little\ncourse 25 miles north of Aberdeen, and bj\nthe sea. Tha opening hole* in tha mom ii j and the closing ones in the afternoon wen played in a wetting rain. But the sun\nwaa seen during the day. Again the\nScotsmen were too good for us. Staltatti\nH. Godfrey and B. Nnxon won their sing loi wad foursomes ami N. Look did well to win\nby two holes in the afternoon. The\nresult: 8-4 to Aberdeen. Our hosts wen moat hospitable and we went to a hop in\nthe evening.\nAfter this final humiliation the te w waa almost over and while half the teas\nfled southwards the others motored through\nthe Highlands to Gleneagles to play two\nlast rounds in Scotland on the scenic\no ours es there. We had a very satie factor/ day's golf there and H. Godfrey produced\nhis best play of the tour, having a72 a the Queen'so our se and 74 on the King's, Next day we returned to London. Many\nthanks are due to our friends in Scotland,\nWe hope they will send teams to tour\nColleges in the south.\nJohn Street\nM.J. Ryeoroft.\nROWING Saturday, March 26th saw the\nculmination of two terms continuous\ntraining on the part of the boat-o lub. The Head of the River, rowed over the\nreverse Boat Raoe o our se of 4j; miles\nfrom Mortlake to Putney, saw nine crews\nfrom ICBC rowing, making the club one of\nthe largest single competitors.\nIC's first V in, starting at number\n24, had a steady and uninspired row, and\nwere overtaken twi oe during the rao e although one of the crews was a fast\nLondon VI H. They finished in a time\nof nineteen minutes, 43 seconds, wh i oh in the final lists gave thorn a pla oe of\n33rd, a drop of nine places.\nThe weather was cloudy, with a lively\nsouth west wind, giving tail wind conditions on the whole of the course exo ep t for the Hasawjramith Reach.\nThere was more confusion at the start\nthis year as the 300 competitors lay is a tangled mass on more than 1\\ miles of\nthe river. However, the organisation\ntriumphed, and the maroons to indicate\nthe start were fired very near to the\nscheduled time.\nThe seo on d VIII, racing better than\nat Reading, overtook two crews, and moved\nup 25 places to finish50 th, only 14 seas\nbehind the first IC VHI.\nMost of the other IC VTIls went down\nin position, with the exception of the\n4th and the 7th VHIS. On the whole it was a disappointing day, but training is\nnow starting for the Regatta season, and\nwe hope that what we have learnt from\nthe Head will help the Club towards a better crew in the summer.\nB.H.P.

For the Count, who baa been\nblowing his top as a band leader for25 tin, this is the fourth tine in as many\n[\u00abr \u00ab that he has brought his boys over\nlit pond to wow the oats in Britain, lad the band seems to get better and\nte tter. The powerful, full toned braes,\nlai smooth driving sax-section and that\nlao os parable rhythm section combine\ntogether to pro duo e, in me at least, apulia tion second to none in the musical\n' world. The stable personnel of the band,\nBier the Count's brilliant and st riot Unction and helped considerably by the\nrn at leadership of Marshall Royal,\nnt ble a them to develop as a single unit\nnther than Just a collection orai oia as.

The latter appears to have settled\nla well ana should sm kea valuable\nlidl tl on to the trumpet section. The\ni clo is ta continued to impress and Basle\nlit is to be giving more of his men the\noha no e to solo. All four trumpeters art\nHOI soloing and Snooky Young1\ns solo on\nbit own' Who Me?' was probably the best\nof the evening at hammersmith,\n(April 23rd). All three trombones were\nfeatured in 'Bag Of Bones', with Benny\nI SMELL BREAD/ The mug shots that you're digging\nto starboard are those of Scream and\nDiezel the beat poet3 two stray cats\nfrom the Jazz Gardeners. That cat on\nthe left looking real smooth in j nute and shades - swings out on box \"ad, and\ndig that cool boy with the big fiddle like a young Wolfgang Amadous - he's really swinging. Crazy. Like they're\ngrazing outside the recording studio man.\nGee, like I smell traps there too >opp a like real still life. Now these boys\nswung out of the studio on a rock kick.\nNow don't climb on me man for digging the\nRock. The way the Gardeners blow it is real Zen - so far out buddy boo. So\nwhen this swinging wax appears on the\nscene, grab a trey man and get real high.\nCrazy. Snap.\nPowell particularly impressive. henry\nCoker's feature on tribe Song is You'\nshowed us what great power and superb\ntone this fine section leader has. The\nBasis sax-section has always been a source of enjoyment for me, and as always\nthe present section boasts some fine soloists. Billy Mitchell' s outing on\n'Whirlybird' was smoothly constructed and\nvery impressive. The other tenor is t, Frank Foster, swung well on an exciting 'Woodchoppers Ball' with much verbal' assistance from the rest of the band.\nFrank Wess's solo work is now largely\nrestricted to flute, and 'The Midgets'\nwith Joe Newman's muted trumpet and Eddie\nJones'sao lid base, found Wess in as\ngreat form as ever. But in discussing\nthe horn soloists one tends to forget the\nman who Io on side r to be the best soloist in the band - Count William Basie, piano.\nNo matter what the critic a say about\ndrum solos, Sonny Payne's feature -on\n' Oil Man River' will quite rightly remain\na guaranteed show-stopper for many years\nto oom e. It was brilliant. Nothing\noo ul d follow Sonny's feature without\nit being an anti-climax. The interval had to be held at thi a point.\n'Joe Williams sings the blues' says the\nprogramme, and from the moment this giant\nstrides onto the stage we hear the Basie\nband at its best. I have always thought\nthat the band swings far more when Joe is integrated into Its midst than at any\n-other time. Maybe this is due to the\nhappy relaxation wh i oh prevails at this\ntime, or maybe to the great arrangements,\nor maybe simple; to the presence of Joe\nWilliams - the man who sings the blues.\nRims hot.\nJAZZ IN THE QUAD IMPERIAL COLLEGE JAZZ CLUB presents a JAZZ HOP \u2022eat un ng the FAIR WEATHER BROWN ALLSTARS S AT MAY7 TH.2/6 ORCHESTRA IC Orchestra\nThe Imperial College orchestra\nhas grown 3tea d ilyin strength during the\npast few years and its present size- is about sixty players. The standard of\nplaying is quite high in all sections and\nplayers with experience of National Youth\nOrchestras and the London University\nOrchestra are amongst the regular players.\nThe conductor is Mr Frank Kennard under\nwhom the orchestra meets for rehearsal\neach week.\nThe programme for the orchestra is a light opera and a concert each year,\nthe former being a combined production\nwith members of the IC oho ir. This year,\nHMS Pinafore was produced with great\nsuccess during the spring terra and the\nconcert is to be given tn is term on May\n12th. Works by-Dvorak, Haydn, Vivaldi and.Ippolitov-Ivanov are to be performed^\nStefan i.i 'pf playing the solo in the\nVivaldi concerto. Many members also\nmeet to play in ensembles and the best of\nthese groups perform a* lunch-time\nconcerts in the College. For some time\nnow, it has been the policy of the\norchestra to become independent of\nprofessional assistance at performances,\nand this objective has now, to all intents and purposes, been achieved.\nThis is mainly a result of increased\nsupport from within the College but\nalso of our friends from the Royal\nCollege of Music, and elsewhere who\nregularly attend our rehearsals and do\nmuch to increase the enjoyment of the\nrest of us. Socially, the orchestra is also very\nactive, strong bonds of friendship having\nbeen formed with other oo lle ges through\ntheir musicians. Musical evenings are\nheld once or twice a term after rehearsals, when as many people as possible are\ncoaxed into performing their f party\npie oe s', the result being aras e mixture\nof humour and musical ability. It is hoped that the present\nstandard can be maintained in the future\nand that any member of the College who\nplays a musical instrument, if interested\nin the Society, will come along to one of\nthe rehearsals. The rehearsals are held,\nas stated before, on Thursdays, being at\n5.30 p.m. in178, Queen's Gate.\n\n"
