Anyway in a recent survey\nof Imperial students, the Hangman\nteam discovered that 67% of Imperial\nstudents would masturbate to this pic-ture, if only they had a copy; I told you\nI\u2019d come through guys.\nThe survey was carried out late at\nnight in the library last week. If a student replied \u201cGet that picture out of\nmy face\u201d, we added them to the \u2018No\u2019\ncolumn. If the student replied \u201cCan I\nhave it, I really need a break from all\nthis revision and I think the toilet\u2019s\nfree\u201d, we put them in the \u2018Yes\u2019 column.\nDisturbingly, it soon became clear that\nwe needed a \u2018Been there, did that\u2019 column after a whopping 48% of respondents told us that they had already masturbated over the picture and that we\nmight want to wash our hands after\nhandling it.\nMore male Imperial students responded \u2018yes\u2019 than female students.\nThe breakdown of male students is as\nfollows, of those who voted \u2018yes\u2019, 39%\nwere frustrated Physics post-grads\nwho haven\u2019t had sex since they joined\nImperial, 51% sabbatical officers who\nhave lost touch with real, enjoyable student life and 4% computing nerds who\nwere too busy watching \u2018Two guys, one\nhorse\u2019 to notice what we showed them.\nA\nfter a year running ICU\nRAG and dressing up\nas a zombie on a regular basis (the picture\non the right is the day\nof his first exam), you\u2019d think that\nLuke Dhanoa/Karandeep/ choose\na name and stick to it you bastard,\nwould be in a prime position to become Council Chair. Unfortunately\nMuch more interesting results were\nthrown up by the female respondents.\n12% tore up the picture, grabbed me by\nthe shirt collar and made violent love\nto me in front of the water fountain\n(is it obvious that I\u2019m really frustrated,\nThe kind of girls Ross Goldberg used to get before he got stabbed. Now that he\u2019s out of the way, its my turn\ngood thing I\u2019ve got this picture). Another 34% turned out to be friends of\nthese Page 3 beauties and set upon me\nscreaming a combination of \u201cPervert!\nRapist! Deviant! Lecher!\u201d, to which I replied \u201cLadies, ladies, hey... please... stop\nthat... it kinda of hurts\u201d. Needless to say\nI spent that night in hospital suffering\nfrom stiletto stab wounds... sigh.\nIf you would like Hangman to\ncontinue publishing photos of\nbeautiful women please email\nhangman.felix@imperial.ac.uk. If\nyou want Hangman to go away,\nalso email and we\u2019ll ignore you\nand publish a picture of you\nlooking stupid as revenge\nScientists discover negative\nmass... really far away\nA\nnew study conducted by\nImperial College\u2019s Einstein Institute has made\na ground-breaking dis-covery: negative mass.\nFor years it has been believed that\nnegative mass did not or could not exist but according to Professor Twiddledee Twiddle-do this was a result of insufficiently powerful technology \u201cThe\nnegative mass is just really far away, it\nis only now that we have the equipment to contact it.\u201d\nThe technology that allowed this\ndiscovery is BT\u2019s new ultra-fast broadband service. With new high capacity\nintegrated servers you can now keep\nin touch with your friends no matter\nwhere they are, even at the other end\nof the galaxy.\nWe are unlikely to see negative mass\non Earth any time soon, apparently it is\nwary of strangers and repelled by \u2018positive devils\u2019 as it describes us. All this\nreporter has to say is \u201cDon\u2019t be scared,\nlet\u2019s hang out, let\u2019s be pals.\u201d\nThe truth is out there... sigh, I am such a douche\nRAG to... umm ZOMG\nIC student buys election\nD\nid you vote in the the\nelections just gone? No?\nNeither did the rest of\nCollege. How then did\nAfonso Manuel an\u00e3o\nCosta Campos win?! I\u2019ll tell you how;\nwith money. This guy is so rich he rents\nthe penthouse suite in Beit, you didn\u2019t\nknow there was one? Well that\u2019s because you\u2019re not rich enough. There\u2019s\na joke in here somewhere (email us if\nyou find it. We sure as hell can\u2019t).\nAfter many minutes of investigation we uncovered the truth. Afonso\n\u201cFonzie\u201d Campos hired a 4th year\ncomputer science student to hack the\nunion voting system, swaying the elections in his favour. 390 votes Campos?\nI bet my left testicle (Bob) 390 votes\nweren\u2019t cast for the entire election.\nTracing the e-paper trail back to the\nsource, Hangman confronted the mercenary student named Hacker McRandy (a really l33t hack0r in the online\ncomunity know as McRandy_1). When\nquestioned McRandy broke into tears,\nsaying Afonso paid him \u00a33.7 million.\nThe sexy truth is exposed!\nUnfortunately Bob couldn\u2019t be re-attached and passed away last night.\nDhanoa eats babies, FACT\nof all people running for the positions\nin the previous elections he\u2019s the only\none who deserves the crown of loser.\nOnly 55 votes, sigh... less than RON.\nWho knows why nobody liked him\nenough to vote for him? All I know is\nthat I can\u2019t wait to have dinner with the\ngirlfriend I would have if I didn\u2019t spend\nall my time making fun of other people\non this page... Wanna go out?

    "content": "science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n10 felix Friday 30 May 2008\nScience\nScience Editor \u2013 Ed Henley\nChemistry provides many examples of involuntary self-experimentation. But this doesn't always lead to the\nnext wunder-compound: Andrew Turley explores the flip side of finding unlooked-for formulae\nI\nmagine the following scenario.\nYou are a diligent young research chemist (they do exist)\nworking alone in the lab late one\nnight. Glancing at the clock you\ndecide you\u2019ve done enough for the day\nso you make some final notes in your\nlab book, put away the chemicals and\nwash up the dirty glassware.\nAs you walk towards the door you\npeel off the latex gloves you are wear-ing, being careful to roll them inside\neach other more out of habit than any\nconviction it helps with safety. Then\nyou take off your safety specs and your\nlab coat, but in doing so you notice\nsomething oily on your fingertips.\nCasually inspecting your lab coat you\ndiscover a small but unfamiliar stain. A\nquiet pang of anxiety gives you cause\nto consider the many compounds used\nsince the morning but this reflective\nmood passes quickly and after washing\nyour hands a little more carefully than\nusual the incident is forgotten.\nWhat happens next? Probably nothing \u2013 the oily compound is most likely\nnothing more than a little vacuum\ngrease you think, transferred to your\nlab coat whilst you fiddled with the\nline. But, small though it may be,\nthere is a chance it is something more\nsignificant.\nA few weeks ago Albert Hofmann,\nthe Swiss chemist who first synthesised LSD, died at the grand old age of\n102. He famously discovered the psychotropic effects of the drug by acci-dent, after getting some on his fingertips \u2013 it passed through his skin and\ninto his blood. His discovery brought\nhim widespread acclaim as \u2018the father\nof LSD\u2019 and a highly successful career\nas a research chemist during which he\npublished over 100 scientific articles\nbefore his retirement in 1971.\nSuch stories of serendipity are common in science and highlight something fundamental about the nature of\nscientific discovery and progress. Many\nhave become extremely well-known\neven outside the scientific community\nand have acquired an almost mythical\nstatus. Everyone knows, for instance,\nthe story of the apple which fell on\nNewton\u2019s head and inspired his musings on gravity, even though it seems\ndoubtful the event actually happened.\nPenicillin, x-rays and the smallpox vac-cine, to name but a few, all provide further examples of discoveries made by\naccident. Together, these stories form\na kind of scientific folklore in which\nserendipity correlates with fame and\nfortune.\nBut the Hofmann story has one aspect that sets it apart: involuntary\nself-experimentation. This type of serendipitous misadventure is not new\nand seems most common in chemis-try. The sweet taste of saccharin, for\ninstance, was discovered by a young\nchemist who simply failed to wash his\nhands before eating lunch. Constantine\nFahlberg had been working on coal tar\nderivatives at Johns Hopkins University when in 1879 his carelessness led\nto success. After quickly patenting the\ncompound he went on to reap considerable financial rewards.\nFalberg and Hofmann both benefited\nfrom their mistakes, but others have\nnot been so fortunate. In 1996 Karen\nWetterhahn, a chemistry professor\nat Dartmouth College, died several\nmonths after spilling a few drops of\ndimethylmercury on her gloved hand.\nThe compound permeated the latex\nbarrier and reached her skin, where, as\nin the case of Hofmann, it entered her\nblood. But unlike Hofmann's, Wetterhahn\u2019s story ended in terrifying trage-dy. She deteriorated over several weeks\nexperiencing nausea, weight loss, loss\nof balance, and slurred speech before\nfinally falling into a coma and dying of\nmercury poisoning aged 48.\nThe remarkable similarities between\nthe stories of Hofmann and Wetterhahn \u2013 both researchers who were\ncompletely unaware they had ingested\nthe compounds under investigation\nuntil they started experiencing symptoms \u2013 contrasted with their startling\ndifferent outcomes highlights the capricious nature of accidental discovery\nin chemistry.\nIt is often said that chemistry does\nnot warrant its reputation for being the\nmost hazardous of sciences \u2013 such superstition harks back to a bygone era.\nWhether or not this is true, the imperfect nature of any safety precaution\nmeans accidents will occur from time\nto time \u2013 it is the nature of the beast,\nhowever well the risks are managed.\nBut we should be wary of allowing beneficial accidents, such as Hofmann\u2019s, to\nslip surreptitiously into our collective\nconception of what science involves in\npractice.\nBedtime stories of serendipity are\nfine for captivating young minds with\nthe thrill of discovery, but when safety\nis compromised the distinction should\nbe clear.\nWhat's up his sleeves? Well, hopefully not the contents of that test-tube in a second: no telling what that might do...\nAccidents will happen: serendipity versus safety\nThree times more numerous than the\nhuman inhabitants of the Australian\ncapital, Canberra, kangaroos are now\nbeing culled by the Ministry of Defence. Eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, have provoked the\nauthorities with their overgrazing of\nCanberra\u2019s outskirts, leaving no grass\nfor the other wild species which live\nthere.\nThese species include the endangered golden sun moth, Synemon pla-na, and the grassland earless dragon,\nTympanocryptis pinguicolla, a tiny lizard once thought to be extinct. Overgrazing by large numbers of kangaroos\nexacerbates the effects of droughts in\nAustralia and diminishes numbers of\nother animals, especially invertebrates,\nsay researchers from the Institute for\nApplied Ecology at the University of\nCanberraandfromLeipzig'sHelmholtz\nCentre for Environmental Research.\nHuman settlement and agriculture\nin the last 200 years led to fragmentation of natural grassland habitats and\nendangering of this fragile ecosystem,\nyet kangaroos adapted to this change\nbetter than other animals. With their\nmain natural predator \u2013 dingoes \u2013 absent their populations go unchecked.\nKangaroos that would once die from\ndroughts now find waterholes installed\nfor cattle and thrive in this human-al-tered environment. This leads to populations too dense to be sustainable and\ncalls for human control of kangaroo\nnumbers.\nIn February 2008 when the local government declined the Ministry of Defence\u2019s proposals for translocation of\nkangaroos, due to high costs, the culling strategy had to be adopted to prevent further damage to the grasslands.\nHowever, culling of thousands of kan-garoosjustoutsidethecapitalprovoked\nanimal rights activists who called the\nkangaroo shootings \u2018barbaric\u2019.\nYet the Ministry of Defence claims\nthe culls are carried out humanely:\nkangaroos are tranquilised from a distance and then captured while sedated\nto avoid stress and pain. The animals\nare then euthanized with a lethal\ninjection.\nA number of people were arrested\nfor trespassing at the site of the culls,\nthe former Belconnen Naval Transmission Station. This did not stop some of\nthe protesters from cutting the fence\nand releasing six still partly-sedated\nkangaroos from the site. Mary Hayes,\nof local campaign group Animal Liberation, told the BBC \"It is a very cruel,\nviolent way to treat animals \u2013 on a par\nto just treating them as if they were\nweeds to be mown or pulled out\". Another wildlife campaigner added that\nthe cull plan was \"just an excuse to kill\nthem\". Defence spokesman Brigadier\nNikolic called for protesters to \u201cact in a\nWhen a national animal becomes a public enemy: Oz's kangaroo culling\nMico Tatalovic\nIncoming Science Editor\npeaceful and law-abiding way\u201d.\nAnd while the kangaroo culling is\nhotly debated not only in Australia but\nin the media worldwide, another Australian wildlife icon, the Tasmanian\ndevil, has just last week been listed\nas endangered. Contagious cancer\ndisease has hit the populations of the\ndevils hard and many are now worried\nfor their survival. Canberra Post calls\nthis the \u201cAustralian dilemma: too many\nkangaroos, too few devils\u201d.\nAin't life a beach. Canberra's not on the coast, but its kangaroos have been left high and dry, facing a\ncontroversial cull, brought on by their overgrazing of grassland habitats surrounding the city\n\n"

Mark\nChamberlain, the only candidate, won\nwith 454 votes. RCSU President David\nCharles, however, won with only 207\nvotes, less than the number of votes\nnewly elected RCSU Vice-President\nAndreas Esau received.\nIn all, turnout and participation was\nhigh with few posts left unfilled. One\nnotable exception is CGCU Mechanical Engineering Society; all of the posts\navailable were uncontested with the\nexception of Departmental Representative which was won by Leo Tagg. This\nleaves MechSoc in the strange position\nof having a DepRep but no Treasurer\nor indeed Chair.\nTwo elections were particularly interesting in terms of the contest and\nthe result. The post of RCSU Treasurer was contested by two first year\nstudents: Ravi Pall and Jacqueline Fok\n(the eventual winner). Both candidates\nplayed on Jacqueline Fok\u2019s surname in\ntheir campaign material. On her post-ers, Jacqueline Fok promised, \u201cI won\u2019t\nFok with your money\u201d while Ravi Pall\nprinted T-shirts featuring the slogan \u201cI\nFok harder and better.\u201d\nThe race for Council Chair saw the\ncurrent RSM President, Danny Hill,\ndefeated by newcomer Afonso Campos by a convincing majority of 390 to\n128 votes. During the election, Afonso\nCampos made use of the recently created rules that allow candidates to campaign on the record, by highlighting\nthat Danny Hill had walked out of a recent Council meeting. Danny Hill and\ncurrent RAG Chair Karandeep Dhanoa\nproduced little or no campaign material in response. Danny Hill\u2019s campaign\nmay have suffered further because the\nmajority of RSM members were absent\nduring the voting period, due to various field trips around the country.\nThere was a large number of fresh-ers running for positions, with 3 out of\nthe 5 Central Union positions won by\nfreshers. Hacks were not under-rep-resented though, with current Deputy\nPresident Educaton & Welfare, Kirsty\nPatterson, and unsuccessful Sabbatical candidates John James and Matthew Taylor elected to positions within\nCGCU.\nYou can all now breathe a sigh of relief that this year\u2019s elections are all over\n(hopefully), but don\u2019t relax for too long;\nthe NUS referendum is just round the\ncorner.\nKadhim Shubber\nWhat a lovely bunch.

Jeremy Paxman may also feature\nGTA IV expansion city revealed\nMichael Cook has seen and played the first downloadable city, and he\u2019s got all the details for you\nG\nTA IV has been a cash\ncow waiting to burst\nopen with the money-milk for some time now.\nDownloadable content\nfeaturing entire cities had been mooted for ages, and I\u2019m pleased to say that\nFelix has seen and played the first city\nrelease, and it\u2019s just as brilliant as you\nmight expect.\nFirst, let\u2019s get the obvious stuff out of\nthe way \u2013 yes, it\u2019s set in London. We\ndon\u2019t have any screenshots to show\nyou, so the pictures that adorn this\npage are only mockups, but London\nwas Rockstar\u2019s choice for the first release and it\u2019s a good one too.\nWe played the expansion for around\ntwo hours, as well as being shown sneak\npeeks at later content too, and we\u2019re\nready to spill as many of the beans as\nwe can to you \u2013 we\u2019ve got a good feel\nfor the story and the locales, as well\nas the characteristic GTA charm that\nyou\u2019ve come to expect from the missions and so on.\nYou play Len Kivingstone, a disgraced political candidate who\u2019s been\nvoted out and left for dead by a rebel\nfaction led by John Borisson (voiced\nby Ian McKellen). We only saw the\nhumble beginnings of the promised\neight-hour storyline, but Rockstar\nsay that it\u2019s about \u201cLen\u2019s fight to\nregain his power and take revenge on the man who murdered\nhis reputation.\u201d\nBut it won\u2019t be an easy fight. When\nyou start out, you\u2019ve got few friends\nand many enemies. People spit at you\nin the street and regular newspaper\nreleases mock you with cutting words\nthat eat away at the newly-introduced\n\u2018Feeling Of Self-worth\u2019 meter.\nCrucially, it\u2019s still GTA IV. The taxi\nservice is retained and looking lovelier\nthan ever \u2013 although in-car radio is\nnow replaced with a complex conversation system which takes some time\ngetting the hang of. At first we just\nhammered the racial insult button, but\nfound that the drivers just talked for\neven longer \u2013 watch out.\nThe beloved mobile phone\nsystem is carried through\ntoo. Now you can\nchoose from a\nhuge range of\nphone models and service providers \u2013 3, for instance, has almost no service connection wherever\nyou are in London, or you can sign up\nto O2 which allows you act like a tosser\nwhenever one of their adverts comes\non the TV.\nAh, TV. Rockstar went to great\nlengths to license huge amounts of authentic British viewing. One channel\nshows reruns of the same four episodes\nof Only Fools And Horses over and over\nagain, one just plays a loop of Ant and\nDec laughing, and the\nother has Jeremy Paxman asking a red-faced man to\n\u2018answer the\nquestion\u2019 for four hours..\n\u201cWe originally recorded a whole\nhost of programmes for the city, but\nplaytesters found this unrealistic.\u201d my\nguide explains, \u201cWe think we\u2019ve got the\ntelevision spot on now.\u201d\nThey have indeed. Right down to the\nway Ant and Dec blend into each other\nas they speak. Animators worked for\neight months in order to turn motion-captured actors into the lifeless goons\nthat ITV viewers know and love.\nGuns are a controversial\npoint in the new pack.\nBecause of their dedication to real-ism, noone has a\ngun\nin the game. Lead Designer Tim \u2018Mitch\u2019\nMitchens explains, \u201cWe experimented\nwith a few different loadouts, but we\nthink our approach now works best \u2013\nyou never see anyone with a weapon,\nyou just hear about it.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a step away from the violence\nof GTA IV, but that\u2019s not to say they\nhaven\u2019t lived up to the mean reputation\nsome parts of the city have.\n\u201cYeah, the insults had to be there.\nIt\u2019s quite graphic, some of it, and we\u2019re\nexpected more complaints than with\nthe original. We drop the f-bomb a lot.\nPeople insult your choice of clothing.\nSome of it\u2019s pretty close to the mark,\nbut we really wanted to convey the\ngrittiness of living in the big smoke.\u201d\nTo demonstrate this, he takes the\ncontroller off me and takes a taxi up\nto Hampstead. There we find an artist\nsitting on the heath, sketching passers-by. He hits a shoulder button.\n\u201cYour use of colour is\nmediocre!\u201d\nThere\u2019s an awkward silence\nin the room, as he knows that\nI haven\u2019t seen anything like this\nbefore in a game.\n\u201cWe\u2019re known for pushing boundaries.\u201d he explains,\n\u201cThere\u2019s more that opens up\nas you go along. You can throw\nbottles at people and spit in the\nstreet. We think it\u2019s good to have\nthat kind of freedom.\u201d\nThe storyline is a mix of mission\nstyles. At first, Len\u2019s mainly small time,\ngiving interviews and hosting radio\nshows from time to time. The media\nseems to be a big thing \u2013 the more\nlisteners you have, the more respect\nyou\u2019ve got.\nLater, though, the storyline picks up.\nAfter our two hour play session was\nover, we were shown future missions\nincluding hanging around outside\nthe Newsnight studios to\nface off with Jeremy\nPaxman, mano a\nmano.\n\u201cJeremy was great fun to work with.\nHe really got into it and even agreed to\ndo a little motion capture.\u201d\nIt shows \u2013 he sneers and cocks his\nhead around in the cutscenes, relentlessly asking the same questions with a\ndead facial expression.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do dead like Jeremy can.\nOur animators have forgotten how to\ndo contempt.\u201d\nThe final mission \u2013 an impromptu\ndebate during the Olympic opening\nceremony \u2013 looks positively electric.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about how well you\u2019ve grasped\nthe insult system, the anecdote-tell-ing. There was originally an option to\nheadbutt Konnie Huq [during the cer-emony] but Konnie requested not to be\na part of the game.\u201d\nEven with our extensive look, we\nknow we\u2019ve seen very little. The promised story time is just the tip of the iceberg \u2013 you can buy shares in Transport\nFor London and eventually incite industrial action, you can file complaints\nwith the Metropolitan Police about\nthe noise generated by your various\nneighbours, you can even take a stroll\naround Imperial itself, which operates\nas a hideout during the series of missions that sees Len gain an honorary\ndoctorate.\nAll in all, a solid-looking release\nfrom a game that was already pushing the boundaries of taste and quality in videogames. There are plenty of\nchanges, but plenty to look forward to,\nand there\u2019s no doubt that residents will\nthoroughly enjoy to bombing down the\nLondon streets in a stolen taxi, on their\nway to purchase the expansion pack\nwhen it\u2019s released next month.\nWhere next for Grand Theft Auto\u2019s\nwinning formula?\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking GTA V may actually be set in Slough. It\u2019s pretty rough. I\nwent there once and someone actually\ncalled me a tosser.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve interviewed Bloods before,\ngone with cops on the beat in New York\nCity, but that really cut. you know? In\nhere.\u201d\nHe touches his chest and looks\nmournful. This is a developer with an\nunderstanding of the modern world,\nand the emotional rollercoaster\nit can be. The future\u2019s looking\ngood for both Rockstar and\ntheir runaway gaming success story.\n\n"

Its blank, steely face stares blindly ahead of it as it marches steadily\nonwards.\nIs this the trailer for the next episode\nof Doctor Who? No, this is a video clip\nof Flame: 1.3 meters tall, 15 kg, and the\nhottest thing in the world of robotics.\nFlame is the brainchild of PhD student Daan Hobbelen of the Delft\nUniversity of Technology in the Netherlands. Walking robots are often designed using industrial engineering\ntechniques, but Hobbelen has taken a\nslightly different approach. \"This type\nof robotics research is mainly focused\non trying to mimic the human motion\nsystem,\" he says. \"If you look at the robotics world, that's something that's\nnot often done\"\nFlame uses algorithms to stabilise\nitself, ensuring that the next step is\nplaced in a way that prevents it from\nfalling. Mirroring the way children\nlearn to walk, Flame walks by falling\nforward in a controlled fashion and\nrighting itself using a built-in compu-ter. The result looks disconcertingly\nhuman.\nAs well as learning to walk like a hu-man, Flame could provide further insights into how people walk. \"We know\nthat the stiffness of the ankle joint influences the stability of walking,\" explains Hobbelen. \"With these robots,\nwe can actually change the stiffness\nvalue to make it higher or lower, and\nsee what the result is\".\nStudies like these will help scientists\nunderstand more about how the ankle\nworks, so people with walking difficulties could benefit.\nWhat's more, people who are missing a limb altogether could be lent a\nhelping hand \u2013 or leg \u2013 from the likes\nof Flame. Hobbelen explains how his\nresearch could improve the design of\nleg prostheses for amputees. \"If you\nunderstand better the actual function and working of the joints, you\ncan make a much better replacement,\"\nhe says. \"They could just walk as they\nwould typically have done before they\nhad an amputation and they wouldn't\nhave to use extra energy\".\nHobbelen hopes that in the future\nwalking robots like Flame might be\nuseful for assisting with dangerous as-signments, such as carrying out tasks\nin nuclear plants. And they might also\nbe handy round the home to help out\nwith the housework. But Flame's true\nmoment of glory will come later this\nweek when it is presented as part of the\nDutch RoboCup team that will play in\nthis summer's RoboCup Soccer championship in China.\nIt might look like one of Doctor\nWho's Cybermen, but Flame's potential to provide insights into walking, to\nbrave nuclear plants and even do the\nvacuuming sounds far from threaten-ing. And who knows, one day Flame\nmight even give David Beckham a run\nfor his money.\nRobot to the rescue: Hobbelen's no-hobble bot\nDaan Hobbelen's robot Flame learned to walk like a child does, and might help people with disabilities\nThere is a question that has long fascinated mankind. Most people have\ngazed up at the stars at some point and\nwondered: Are we alone? This week\na spacecraft completes its ten-month\nflight to Mars, and we may soon be\ncloser to knowing whether life exists\non another planet.\nA good way to begin the hunt for\nMartian life is to look for what living\nthings need \u2013 such as water. \u201cWe\u2019ve\nnever been in a position to look for\nwater,\u201d explained Dr Tom Pike, from\nImperial College London. He leads a\nresearch team that has developed silicon discs with a finely etched surface\nfor holding Martian soil samples. \u201cThe\nwater on Mars is below the surface, it\u2019s\nnot on top. And nobody has dug down\nto any great depth.\u201d\nBut on the 26th of May, NASA\u2019s\nPhoenix spacecraft will land on Mars\nand its central mission will be the\nsearch for water at the planet\u2019s north\npole. A robotic arm will dig for ice that\nhas already been detected under the\nred planet\u2019s surface by NASA\u2019s Mars\nOdyssey.\nDr Pike\u2019s team will work at mission\ncontrol at the University of Arizona to\nstudy microscope images of the Martian soil. The images are capable of\nshowing features one thousandth the\nwidth of a human hair \u2013 the highest\nresolution ever used on soil from another planet.\nOnce Phoenix returns its data, the\nresearchers will be among the first\npeople to conduct the most detailed\nanalysis of Martian soil and dust sam-ples. They can then look at questions\nabout the history of the ice: was it once\npart of an ancient ocean? Is it the remains of a retreating ice sheet?\nThis may tell us more about the\nclimate cycles on Mars, for instance\nNicely done, especially in perspective. In fact, Phoenix passed 20 km in front of Heimdall crater, and landed successfully just days ago, beating\nthe best efforts of the \"great galactic ghoul\", which has claimed so many previous Mars missions., including both of Phoenix's progenitors. In\nother news, if you've not spotted, the BBC is running a diary from Imperial's Dr. Tom Pike \u2013 well worth a read!\nMission to Mars: Phoenix examines soil using Imperial technology\nTamsin Osborne\nwhether the ice occasionally melts. If\nso, microbes may be able to live in the\nmelted ice, provided that other factors\nare right. NASA\u2019s Phoenix will also\nsearch for these other features, such as\ncompounds containing carbon. These\ncarbon-based compounds include the\nchemical building blocks of life and\nsubstances used as an energy source.\nHowever, Phoenix is unlikely to show\nthat life definitely exists on Mars, \u201cunless we see a little bug crawl across the\nsubstrate under the microscope \u2013 we\u2019re\nnot expecting that,\u201d says Pike. But a future European mission, ExoMars, will\nsearch specifically and thoroughly for\nsigns of Martian life.\nFor now, the scientists hope to find\nout whether anything could live on\nMars. \u201cWe are going to be able say\nwhether Mars is a potential home for\nlife, rather than directly answer the\nquestion of whether there is life on\nMars.\u201d\nKatrina Pavelin\nNASA/JPL-CALTECH/UNIVERSITY\nOF\nARIZONA\nFlame in action \u2013 by falling in a controlled fashion, before righting itself, the robot mimics the way children\nlearn to walk. Those hamstrings must help it on the RoboCup pitch \u2013 as must its sure-footedness\nFor more on Flame, including\nmovies, follow the \"Walking like a\nhuman\" link through from\nhttp://home.tudelft.nl/en/\nApology: The spruce mentioned\nlast week is found in Dalarna\nprovince, not Darlana, as\nreported.

Since the age of\naround seventeen,\nI\u2019ve had bands that\nI like and listen to, yes. But someone\nwho genuinely loves music \u2013 and there\nare plenty at any university \u2013 get a\nmuch more complex kick from it that\nI can never understand.\nNow, this may make you a bit suspicious of my writing for this section \u2013 I\ndid once own an Avril Lavigne album\n\u2013 and if you\u2019re one of the people who\ngo into anaphylactic shock upon contact with a video-game then this article\nmay be fatal. However, I need to do it,\nbecause if music is your religion then\nAudiosurf could well become your virtual rosary beads.\nLet\u2019s get straight down to it \u2013 Audiosurf is a game about Music. It\u2019s not\nabout guns, or strategy, no-one ever\nuses the word \u201cgrind\u201d when discussing\nit, and there are no Americans unless\nyou listen to Neil Diamond a lot. The\ngame is here to make your music inter-active, and that\u2019s exactly what it does.\nGive Audiosurf a piece of audio\n\u2013 usually music \u2013 and it\u2019ll number\ncrunch the noise into a three-dimen-sional racetrack that rises, twists and\ncurls in time with the music. You can\nthen race along the track in a variety\nof modes, grabbing colours blocks that\nappear in time with the music.\nIf it sounds basic, then that\u2019s because\nit is. Audiosurf is just five pounds or\nthereabouts, and there is nearly zero\nincluded content \u2013 everything comes\nfrom the files already on your hard\ndrive. But describing it doesn\u2019t do\njustice to just how clever the number\ncrunching actually is.\nPop on some rock or pop and the guitar thrashing causes huge downward\nsurges in the track, with flurries of\nhigh-scoring reds shooting up towards\nyou. Stick on some heavy-bass music\nand the track bounds up and down in\ntime with the line, tossing groups of\ncolours as each instrument kicks in.\nOf course, the algorithm isn\u2019t perfect and so the best results come from\nsomething with noise, rhythm, or a bit\nof variety in its instruments. My current love, The Divine Comedy, reacts\nwell to Audiosurf in most places, but\nthe mournful piano of Regina Spektor\nis too tame to produce anything worth\nplaying in most cases.\nEveryone has something playable,\nthough, and what\u2019s really fun about Audiosurf is this social aspect. You\u2019ll spend\nlots of time telling people the really\ngood songs you\u2019ve raced on, and thanks\nto recent updates it even scrobbles the\ntracks you ride to Last. FM too.\nMost important, however, are the\nscoreboards. Each track has its own\nranking system on the Audiosurf serv-ers, and as you play your high scores\nare uploaded to compete against other\nplayers nationally, internationally, and\njust amongst your friends. It\u2019s just as\nmuch fun to discover you\u2019re the only\nperson to have ever played a song\n(made obvious by being the only one\non the scoreboard) as it is to top out\na high scoreboard for your favourite\nsong. It\u2019ll even email you to tell you\nwhen friends beat you, or when you\u2019re\nknocked off of that elusive top spot.\nFor a measly ten dollars, Audiosurf\nis a great piece of kit \u2013 barely even a\ngame. It\u2019s got a visualisation mode\nwhich is great for parties, social bits\nand pieces that make it great with\nfriends, and in general is a unique way\nto experience music.\nThere is one downside \u2013 you need\nto install another program, Steam, to\nplay it \u2013 but it\u2019s relatively unobtrusive nowadays and allows the game\nto update itself automatically, which\nis handy. Once you\u2019ve played your favourite album at one in the morning\nwith the lights off and your best headphones on, you\u2019ll never look back. Suck\nup those gaming phobias, and get into\nthe best thing to happen to music since\nthe mp3.\nThe Audiosurf Ear Buffet\nThe Postal Service\nBrand New Colony\nhttp://tinyurl.com/62bx4y\nBelle And Sebastian\nLe Pastie De La Bourgeoisie\nhttp://tinyurl.com/5zw6rw\nSteve Ouilmette\nDevil Went Down To Georgia\nhttp://tinyurl.com/6e7wtw\nJ.S.

A favourite character\nof mine was Harry Biscuit, son of the\ninventor of the biscuit and apparently a\nparody Herbert Pocket of Great Expectations. His actions included being too\npreoccupied by having missed lunch to\nremember to look for his kidnapped\nwife and saving the day by eating his\nway out of a train tunnel made of food-truly a man after my own pie-loving\nheart.\nAs a first experience of being part\nof the audience of a show, I was smit-ten. Unfortunately, my fantasy route\nto stardom was crushed as it seems\nabout half of the small audience had\nmy idea of \u2018use-an-individual-laughto-get-heard-on-the-radio\u2019, with many\nchortles, cackles and whoops being\nheard. Or maybe that\u2019s just what Radio 4 listeners sound like, who knows?\nMetaphors using pots of brewing tea,\nincidents with horses and balloons\nand jokes about teenage boys being\nrendered blind by the sight of a full-grown woman added to the arche-typically British style of comedy.

Luckily, Bleak Expectations, described by\nthe BBC as \u201cA Victorian Epic of evil\nun-dead guardians, very rotten boroughs and a railway built of beef and\npastry, in the style of Charles Dickens\nafter too much gin,\u201d definitely hit the\nfunny-spot.\nFirst of all, I feel I have to say that\nwatching a radio show being recorded\nis a bit weird. Warm-up sessions (for\nthe audience, not the cast), re-takes\nand a little green light going on whenever someone was supposed to speak\ndefinitely set the whole experience apart from a usual trip to the\ntheatre. Getting into the Radio 4 theatre at the BBC Broadcasting House is a\nbit like getting through security at an\nairport; we were even ushered into a\nwaiting area before being shown to our\nseats.

Even if the\nshow had been absolutely rubbish I\nwould still have been ridiculously smug\nabout the evening.\nMy limited knowledge of Dickens\n(just the obligatory reading of Great\nExpectations in Year 8 and a school\ntrip to Rochester) meant that I didn\u2019t\nget some of the parodies.

It\nalso seems that the thirst for two-way\nbackscratching hasn\u2019t lessened since\nthe times of empire-building loons ei-ther, if the latest hijinks in Burma are\nanything to go by.\nReports from news services and the\nconference in Rangoon suggest that\nhuman compassion in the modern day\ncould come with a pricetag \u2013 help to\nthe cyclone-devastated population of\nBurma could be restricted based upon\nthe government\u2019s motions towards\nopen and free democracy.\nNo-one could claim that Burma\u2019s\nmilitary junta are anywhere near the\ntop of the global sanity rankings, and\ntheir response to protests last year are\nstill fresh in many people\u2019s minds. Nevertheless, the idea of holding a nation\nto ransom for the glory of democracy\nseems slightly bitter tasting, given the\ninitial rush to help the population who\nseem to be suffering terribly.\nFor me, it strangely brings back\nmemories of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nOver time, everyone accepted that\nthere simply were no weapons of mass\ndestruction within the borders. But\nthose who still wanted to support the\nwar quickly found new justification.\nMost often, this proved to be something along the lines of \u201cIraq is better\noff without a dictatorial ruler.\u201d And\nwhile twenty-four hour news channels were happy to prove this at first, it\nquickly became evident that this wasn\u2019t\nthe case. Look at Iraq now, and even\nthrough the media\u2019s eyes it\u2019s a sad sto-ry. What little stability is present there\nis not enough to rebuild a nation, and\nelsewhere there is chaos.\nThe West always presumes to know\nbetter, and that\u2019s understandable. We\ninvented the Computer, the American Dream and the Teabag. Naturally,\nwe feel that we know where the world\nshould be heading. Many postgrads at\nImperial are working on this very principle \u2013 that faraway countries are doing it wrong, and we can do it better,\nand here\u2019s how.\nIt\u2019s a policy that overstretches infrastructures at home, fuels suspicion\nof Western culture, and damages the\ncountries in question by stop-starting\ntheir way of life. That\u2019s not to say Imperial\u2019s work is second-rate or damag-ing, but there are questions to be asked\nwhen considering intervention at this\nhigh political level.\nIf we make these bold demands of\nBurma, they will almost certainly be\nrejected. And then what? Either we\nlose face on the international scene by\ngiving in to a police state, or millions\ndie. Alternatively, we suck it up, do the\nhumanitarian thing, and give aid to\npeople in need.\nI\u2019m not a particularly compassionate person when it comes to international politics, but I do think that if any\nof the world\u2019s major problems are to\nbe solved, then countries need to cooperate without an agenda. Britain\u2019s\nresponse has shown that we\u2019re still as\npetty as the states we oppose \u2013 and the\ntime for pride swallowing is running\nout.\nI guess there\u2019s a lesson here for us all\nMichael Cook\nThe Burmese government\u2019s refusal to accept international aid has left\nhundreds of thousands homeless after Cyclone Nargis\n\u201c\nThe West\nalways presumes\nto know\nbetter\nA. Geek\nA repetitive truth\nI\ndon\u2019t know how many of you\ngrabbed the celebrity whine-fest\nthat was Channel 4\u2019s 11th Hour\nlast week, but if you did you\nmight be interested to know that\nI\u2019m hosting a group counselling session\nin the JCR this coming Tuesday to try\nand recover from it.\nAlthough I\u2019ve envisaged television\nshows combining the concepts of\nLeonardo DiCaprio and loss of human life before, the producers of this\nshow didn\u2019t combine the two ideas as\nI might have, presumably for legal rea-sons. What results is a kind of whiny,\nwatery program that\u2019s a bit like An Inconvenient Truth, but with a friendlier\nlook on its face. Like being told you\u2019ve\ngot an incurable disease, but by Emma\nThompson.\nThe programme probably could\u2019ve\nbeen made by anyone who\u2019s picked up\na copy of The Independent recently, but\nthat\u2019s not the point \u2013 I associate MS\nPowerpoint with global warming so\nstrongly now, that whenever someone\nshows me a pie chart I immediately\nstrip down to my hemp underpants.\nThe point is that I can\u2019t think of a single reason to broadcast a show like\n11th Hour anymore, because the message it had for us boiled down to this \u2013\nthe world is in trouble, but there\u2019s still\ntime.\nWell, that\u2019s all very well, but the world\nand its solar panel knows about global\nwarming these days. Sure, there are\nsome who refuse to accept it in public,\nor downplay its significance, but there\nisn\u2019t a single person who doesn\u2019t see\nthe processes in effect. The naysayers\nare just outward deniers \u2013 as with me,\nI know that Boris is mayor, I just feel\nbetter if I whisper to myself that it\u2019s not\ntrue.\nWhat I suspect was the real reason\nbehind it was to keep pressure on the\npeople mentally. There\u2019s a widespread\nbelief that if you stop bellowing a warning at people they will forget it, which\nis why we still have \u201cKill Your Speed\u201d,\n\u201cDon\u2019t Drink And Drive\u201d and \u201cHalfPrice Sale Now On At DFS\u201d despite\nthe fact that we know it all by heart\nalready.\nHowever, I\u2019m of the opinion that this\nhas the opposite effect. Global Warming is something of a unique problem\n\u2013 similar in structure to voter apathy,\nit requires individual involvement on\na large scale. Whisper the message in\npeople\u2019s ears too often, and they switch\noff the recording equipment. The\ntreadmill is still running, but the seventy year-old with a weekend gym pass\nis now firmly embedded into the wall.\nIt\u2019s made even worse by the \u201cwe can\nstill save the day, if we act now\u201d subtext,\nbecause act now has been the mantra\nfor two decades, and the fact that the\nsituation is still being marketed as reversible is causing a lot of people to\nswitch off.\nPeople and business are changing.\nThey may be changing too slowly according to most studies, but the fact\nthat they\u2019re acting at all suggests that\nnow is the time to stop lecturing and\nstart the practical work.\nProgrammes about real-life conser-vation, green practices and how-to\u2019s\nwould do a lot better than trawling out\nthe same carbon dioxide cycle diagram\nall over again. We get it now \u2013 less\ntrees, more pollution. We all watched\nCaptain Planet, we don\u2019t need to see it\nanimated.\nI have no doubt that we\u2019ll see more\nof these shows this year and further\non. The combination of celebrity with\na Panorama-like taste for hysteria is a\ngood mix for the media outlets, and for\nall I know it may be the only way to get\nthe topic shown on American TV at\nall. But I\u2019m left with a nagging feeling\nthat we\u2019ll look back in ten years\u2019 time\nand decide that the real reason things\nprogressed so slowly is because we\nspent too much time debating, and not\nenough time acting.\nLeonardo DiCaprio staring out the camera in 11th Hour\n\u201c\nWe get it \u2013\nless trees, more\npollution.

Following intensive novice recruitment at the\nbeginning of the academic year, only\nthe elite few remain. Now unrecognis-able behind layers of muscle, the crews\nhave refused to submit to the lure of\nsleep, a good education or any form of\nsocial life beyond rowing. Both men\nand women novice squads have performed well over the past year, collecting medals for both regatta and head\nrace events in the novice categories.\nThe Twickenham Regatta was the first\ntime the novice crews were entered in\nsenior events.\nLike all rowing-related activities, it\nwas an early start on Sunday morning,\nmade even earlier as I was convinced\nby Deeps to accompany her on the\nbus. Dodging rain and hopping over\npuddles I waved a fond farewell to my\nbike and braved the public transport\nsystem, catching the 391 towards Richmond, a stop before Deeps would join\nme. But alas, there was no sign of the\nDeepmeister. A phone call later I was\ninformed that I would be wandering\nalone in Richmond in search of the\nboating area since a certain alarm had\n\u2018failed\u2019 to initiate. Fortunately my incredible navigational skills (and map)\nensured I arrived before ICBC boats\nand crews.\nRacing was scheduled all day over a\n1250 metre course along the Thames\nfrom a stakeboat start. Races were\ngladiator style; one on one; with a staggered start due to the winding nature\nof the river. First up was the women\u2019s\nnovice four coxed by Katie Oliver\nand entered in the WS3 4+ and WS4\n4+ categories. The crew consisted of\nDeepika Reddy at bow, Anna Jones at\ntwo, Mackenzie Clavin at three, while\nI took the stroke seat. We cruised past\nHSBC in the opening heat but were\nless fortunate against Twickenham\nin the semi-final. A second Imperial\ncrew was entered in the same category\ncoxed by Connie Pidoux with novice\nSelina Graham at stroke, Ro Smith at\nthree, Deborah Tamulonis at two and\nClarice Chung at bow. They received a\nbuy in the first heat, defeated Marlow\nin the semi-final and thwarted Twickenham to win outright in the final. The\nsame crew were also racing in the WS2\n4+ event and after another buy round\nhad to spin and race in a straight final against Guildford, finding victory\nagain.\nRain continued to drizzle as afternoon approached and little grass remained in the expanding fields of mud.\nMost had sensibly worn wellies, but\nwanting to maximize boat speed by reducing extra weight I choose flip-flops,\nwhich apparently aren\u2019t very compatible with mud. Mammy Trapmore\ntook a break from washing and shining boats to pop down to the shops and\npurchase a gazebo to protect her little\ncrews from the harsh conditions. We\nthank her for the bag of goodies too.\nWhat a trooper.\nEton Excelsior put a halt to Imperial\u2019s\nvictory in the WS2 2x event defeating\nseniors Claire Waterworth and Katy\nSmith in the opening heat and Rachael Davies and Cynthia Mynhardt in\nthe final. However, when the doubles\ncombined as a quad in the WS2 4x\nthey were an unstoppable force and\ndefeated Tideway Scullers in the semi\nand Twickenham in the final.\nThe men\u2019s novice crew were also in\naction in the S3 4+ event. Coxed by\nHelen Waller the crew were John Dick\nat stroke, Michael Zammit at three,\nCarlos Schuster at two and Frank Murphy at bow. Despite serious Marshall\ncalls of \u2018Is there a Dick in the boat?\u2019,\nmade even more poignant due to\nJohn\u2019s \u2018lucky\u2019 pink hair band, the crew\nremained focused and beat Staines in\nthe opening round, Twickenham in the\nsemi-final and Marlow RC in the final.\nWith most of the other crews done\nracing for the day, only the novice\nwomen remained to race by late after-noon. The rain had eased but a strong\nhead wind had picked-up. After some\ntactical pointers from Steve, we easily\ndefeated Thames RC in the first heat\nputting the weeks of bench pressing\nto good-use, overcame Guildford RC\nin the semi-final and took first place\nin the final by over three lengths from\nEton Excelsior. Despite our comfortable lead I maintained the 34 s/m rating to the finish, ensuring Deeps would\nremember to set two alarms next time\nwe got the bus.\nThe novice men\u2019s crew, high from\ntheir earlier victory, stayed on as loyal\nsupporters and were a welcome sight\nChristina Duffy\ncheering from the regatta enclosure.\nWith wins across the board for all novice crews in senior events, a single ARA\npoint was gained by each crew member disallowing any further participation in novice events. Understandably,\nCarlos Schuster needed a moment\nto compose himself during this very\nemotional time which revealed Frank\nas a pillar of support and comfort to all\ncrews. It was a huge milestone for all\ninvolved and comes deservedly so, due\nto the dedication to club training that\nthis year\u2019s novices have shown, if I do\nsay so myself, and I do.\nWith de-rigging complete and obligatory crew photos taken we cleared up\nand loaded the trailer for Putney. Much\nto the dismay of my liver, the free lift\nback to Putney with Steve was sabotaged at the last minute by the novice\ncrews. With the sun finally shining and\nspirits high we skipped back to Richmond for a celebratory meal in Tootsies\nand a few drinks along the river. The\nfestivities continued to Anna\u2019s house\nin Richmond where 52 cards, a terrible\nring of fire and some shirt swapping\nsomehow resulted in Michael Zammit\nwearing a dress. And yes, there is photographic evidence of this.\nEvery Imperial competitor came\naway with a first place victory and a\npint pewter tankard; an incredible\nachievement for the club. Well done\nto all winning crews and especially to\nformer novices! Our first race as official seniors takes place next weekend\nin the Metropolitan Regatta at Dorney\nRowing Lake in Eton. This multi-lane\nregatta race is one of the main events\nin the rowing calendar and has entries\nfrom all ICBC squads. Best of luck to\neveryone!\nMen\u2019s novices take the lead in S3 4+ event\n\n"

    "content": "20 felix Friday 30 May 2008\nA girl, here? On the Internet? Then the hour has finally arrived. Prepare the inappropriate comments and overcompensating co-operation!\nLisa and The Masked Balls\nT\nhe difficulty with running\na student paper is that\nyou don\u2019t always get the\nbig exclusives. Imagine\nmy surprise, then, when\nwe were approached by Rockstar last\nweek to test drive their latest addition\nto the GTA IV franchise.\nWe obviously leapt at the offer and\nhave got our first thoughts just over\nthe page for you to take in, mull over\nand reflect upon.\nOn an unrelated \u2013 and possibly more\ntruthful \u2013 note, it looks like the next\nlove of my gaming life will be severely\ndelayed this year, as Left 4 Dead seems\ndestined to not make it onto Steam before the next Imperial year begins.\nHowever, that\u2019s probably not bothering many of you, as 2008 looks to\nbe a stonking year for gaming. We\u2019ve\nstill got big hitters like Spore to come,\nMetal Gear Solid IV has probably been\npost-it-noted by Playstation owners on\neverything they own, and some nonsense about Gears of War is going on\nin Winter too. I guess.\nLook, Gears of War is fine, it\u2019s just\nvery brown. Most of my gaming time\nthese days is spread across Team Fortress 2 \u2013 which is the gaming equivalent of being shotgunned in the face\nwith Skittles \u2013 and Company of Heroes \u2013 which, whilst being brown, also\nincludes sweary British people in red\nberets, and therefore is ten times as\ngood.\nThe gaming industry has good years\nand bad ones. Sometimes you get a\nlot of disappointments and a lacklustre Christmas season. This year is the\nopposite \u2013 a lot of the key franchises\nhave come full circle to release again,\nand the next-gen consoles have really\nfound their feet which means people\ncan actually admit to owning one without sounding like they\u2019ve got too much\nmoney to spend sensibly.\nIf you didn\u2019t make it to the Games\nand Media Event a few weeks ago, you\nmissed out on some thought-provok-ing stuff. Some of the talks were so far\naway from what we think of as gaming\ntoday that they seemed sci-fi; there was\ntalk of AI sophisticated enough to read\nthe player\u2019s mind, or solve problems by\nbeing shown the kind of solution the\nplayer wants.\nThat makes this year\u2019s release schedule look a bit tamer. We\u2019ve had a few\nquantum leaps in recent years \u2013 the Wii\nrevolutionised how we thought about\nconsole interaction, and the other two\nkey consoles have really pushed the\ngraphics fidelity. But GaME reminded\nme of all the things that gaming doesn\u2019t\nreally concentrate on any more.\nA good year in gaming is one with\nmore than just a higher polycount.\nKeep an eye on STALKER\u2019s prequel,\nthe latest Total War game, and Spore\nfor an indication of where the other\nside of games are going. Short answer\n\u2013 impressively far.\nMichael Cook would like you introduce you to his lady friend. Have you met?\nS\no Lisa, you a girl?\u201d\nOkay. You\u2019re completely prepared for this, and it\u2019s perfectly okay to lie. All the good\njournalists have pretended to\nbe a woman on the internet at some\npoint in their lives. It\u2019s culture. It\u2019s how\nthe world works nowadays. It\u2019s edgy.\n\u201cThe hell does it matter, exactly?\u201d\nYeah. That\u2019s exactly what a girl would\nsay in this situation. Well done. That\u2019s\nsmooth.\nFor the record, I didn\u2019t do this for\nweird kicks. The problem is that I don\u2019t\nbelieve most of what I\u2019m told about\ngaming. When I strayed onto the internet yet again to research a piece on\nPink Gaming, I found so much sensationalist claptrap being written, that I\ndecided to see what it was like being a\ngaming girl. What follows is my personal experience only. I could well be\nwrong in my conclusions.\nThe game is Company of Heroes, and\ndespite hypothesising that the community would treat \u2018LisaFinn\u2019 more\nhumanely than the testosterone-filled\nworld of first-person shooters, this actually proves to be incorrect. Waiting\nin the lobby to start an eight-man game\n(or rather, a seven-man, one-woman\ngame, wink-wink), the chat finally\nstrays towards me, with the line I used\nto open the article.\nI stare at my response and consider\nwhether it was as subtle as it sounded\nin my head, but they don\u2019t seem to\ncare.\n\u201cok, ok, cool. but are you?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a \u2018lol\u2019 or two, and then he tells\nme he\u2019s joking. And that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the\nextent of the abuse. We start the game\nup, and within ten minutes they\u2019re\nquite rightly abusing me for playing\nthe game on a computer so ancient it\nprobably saw action in World War 2\nfirst-hand.\nThe weird thing is, it\u2019s like this pretty\nmuch everywhere. I concede, someone\nadded me to their friends list with essentially no interaction whatsoever,\nbut I put that down to high spirits and\nthe fact that he was trying to convince\neveryone that 9/11 was a plot by the\nUS Government.\nI moved onto the raging man-fest\nthat is Team Fortress 2, and here my\npresence barely registered. I was rubbish at the game, was occasionally ridiculed for it, and just went on playing.\nIt got to the point where I forgot I was\nusing a female pseudonym at all.\nI tried more. Gaming chat rooms\n\u2013 nothing. CounterStrike \u2013 nothing.\nFailure after failure after failure until\nI just gave up. It\u2019s been done so many\ntimes before, those extended features,\nconfessions of journalists who dove\ndeep into enemy territory and tricked\ndozens before escaping, cover story\nintact.\nBy contrast, all I found was complete\napathy. Either I\u2019d stumbled onto the\nAsexual United Clan\u2019s private server,\nor the girl gaming story wasn\u2019t what it\nwas cracked up to be.\nI think it\u2019s partly a question of perception \u2013 at the end of the day, I\u2019m\nnot a girl (apologies to my fans), and\nso maybe I don\u2019t pick up on the slights\nand prejudices as they might. It\u2019s true\nthat if I asked for a game setting to be\nchanged, it generally was without ques-tion. But the story of the oppressed girl\ngamers isn\u2019t one of over-the-top help\nand assistance. Where were the insults?\nThe patronising offers of explanation?\nThe request for \u2018pics plz\u2019?\nI\u2019d imagine there\u2019s more to the idea of\nbeing a girl in the online arena than can\nbe gleaned from changing your name\nto Lisa for the day. But I think the idea\nthat gamers are naturally sexist, that\nthe world of videogames is one that is\ndominated by penis-wielding maniacs\nand entirely shut off to anyone of the\nfairer sex, is something that\u2019s going to\ngo out of the window along with incitement to violence, decline in motor\nskills, and a lust for anim\u00e9 boobs.\nThe only barrier left now is the term\nitself \u2013 \u2018girl gamer\u2019 now conjures up\nbizarre images of the gaudy blogs that\ntreat themselves like revolutionaries\nfighting for liberation, or the atrocious\nattempts to promote girl gaming as a\nsexy occupation.\nOnce that\u2019s all out of the way we can\nget back to the real issues facing gaming \u2013 why do some people insist on\nusing control-groups zero and nine\nfor anything other than artillery? Now\nthat\u2019s prejudice I can get behind.\nGirl gamers \u2013 being taken seriously since the 21st Century.

Significantly less independence-minded than his\npredecessor, relations with the mainland are set to improve\ndramatically under his leadership. This was made particularly\nobvious this week, when the head of Taiwan\u2019s ruling party (the\nnationalist Kuomintang) met Chinese President Hu Jintao in\nBeijing\u2019s \u2018Great Hall of the People\u2019 . This is the highest-level\nencounter between the two parties since the split in 1949, and\nthe second such major meeting arranged by the Kuomintang.\nNew Republic\nNepal\nAfter more than two centuries of existence, Nepal\u2019s\nmonarchy has been abolished by the newly-elected national\nassembly. King Gyanendra famously came to power in tragic\ncircumstances in 2001 after his nephew\u2019s drunken murder of\nmost of the royal family. He went on to reign for five years\nas head of government before being forced to return power\nto parliament in 2006. Since then, the ancient monarchy has\nheld a purely ceremonial status in Nepal, a status no longer\naccorded it. Under the new legislation, the entire royal family\nmust leave the palace within 15 days, though they will be\nallowed to remain in the country.\n\u2018Ogre of the Ardennes\u2019\nFrance\nA French court has sentenced Michel Fourniret to life\nimprisonment for the murder of seven girls and young women\nbetween 1987 and 2001. Fourniret\u2019s wife, Monique Olivier,\nhas been awarded a similar sentence for complicity in the\nmurders, the largest serial killing spree in recent French history.\nKnown as the \u2018Ogre of the Ardennes\u2019, Fourniret would get the\nunsuspecting women into his car, where his wife\u2019s presence\nwould foster a feeling of security. After being kidnapped, the\ngirls were usually raped by Fourniret, who would later dump\ntheir body somewhere in the area. The man was finally arrested\nin 2003 while attempting to kidnap a 13-year old Belgian girl.\nAlthough Fourniret has confessed to most of the murders, he\nhas been markedly uncooperative in the court\u2019s proceedings.\nDesigned by Gilead Amit & Kadhim Shubber\nNew Speaker\nIran\nFormer nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani has recently been elected as\nthe speaker of the Iranian parliament. The post, to which Mr. Larijani\nwas elected by a large majority, effectively makes him the leader of the\nopposition to current President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Speculation\nindicates that Larijani may prove a welcome alternative to the current\nregime, providing a more pragmatic stance on economics, combined\nwith the same popular conservatism. Larijani\u2019s pragmatism has not\nendeared him to the government, however, as his preference for\npracticality over ideology led to greater collaboration with the IAEA\nand helped end the crisis over captured British sailors in 2007. This\nmindset contributed to his losing his job as chief nuclear negotiator.\nHis return as one of the most powerful figures in Iran, with the support\nof kingmaker Ayatollah Khomeini, may well allow him to provide a\nchallenge to the presidency in the 2009 elections.,\n\n"

Write for us\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nH\nello my little arty friends.\nI\u2019m writing this over the\nBank Holiday weekend,\nand the weather\u2019s awful.\nRain on a Bank Holiday\nweekend? Not acceptable. Mind you,\nit\u2019s not like we\u2019re able to enjoy ourselves in the sun at the moment, what\nwith exams and miscellaneous other\ntortures. I have spent my rainy weekend camped out in the library, lovingly\ncrafting (read: hurriedly botching to-gether) an essay about fungus (such is\nthe glamour of biology). I hope you\u2019ve\nbeen doing something more fun.\nHere at Felix, we don\u2019t let exams stop\nus.Nosir!We\u2019vebeenturningourbacks\non our expensive educations to bring\nyou some more lovely articles. This\nweek we have some controversial views\non Pygmalion, a delve into the valley of\ndelights that is Radio Four (featuring\nDavid Mitchell \u2013 can I just say that the\nlast episode of Peep Show was excel-lent? Best thing on TV), and a review\nof Marguerite by Lucy Harrold (you\u2019ve\nbeen treated to a lot of Lucy recently \u2013\nwe\u2019ve been working our favourite journalistic slavey person hard).\nBefore you get stuck into all that, I\u2019ve\ngot some hot tips for you. Now, part of\nmy job as an editor is emailing press offices and PR people to beg for free tickets and pretty pictures. Some are more\nhelpful than others, and sometimes\nthey get a bit overexcited and pelt us\nwith information about all the obscure\nevents they\u2019re promoting. Mostly we\nhit the delete button, but this week I\u2019ve\nreceived news of two potentially nifty\nevents I think you might be interested\nin.\nFirstly: Dirty Dancing. Film from the\neternal genre that is \u201cboy meets girl,\nboy and girl get caught up in gritty is-sues, but gritty issues are resolved by\nhaving a bit of a dance\u201d. But it\u2019s also a\nWest End musical! To honour the famous line from the film \u201cI carried a\nwatermelon??\u201d, the first 20 people who\nturn up with a watermelon at the Aldwych Theatre at 10am on August 4th\nwill win top notch tickets to see the\nshow that night. Do you know what\nAugust 4th is? National Watermelon\nDay. No, I\u2019m not making this up.\nSecondly: MEDICS, LOOK HERE.\nIn the next few weeks I\u2019ll be treating\nyou to a review of the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons\n(aka Museum of Medical Oddities\nin Jars). But in case you can\u2019t wait for\nthat, they\u2019ve got a fancy lecture coming up on 12th June at 7pm. The title\nis \u201cAnatomical dissection: is it still relevant to surgical training?\u201d. Tickets are\napparently free to all medical students\n(you might want to book though \u2013 go\nlook at their nice website for details),\nand just think of all the flashy surgeons\nyou could meet! A prime opportunity\nfor some networking, I reckon.\nDon\u2019t say I don\u2019t keep you informed.\nRemember, there are always dozens of\nother exciting artistic things happening in London, and we can send you\nfor free (all we ask in return is a few\nwords\u2026). Say hello via arts.felix@im-perial.ac.uk.\nMoral of story: sex with\nNazis never works out well\nLucy Harrold goes to see a brand new musical with everything \u2013 sex, Nazis, Jewish\nmusicians and good, old, French sauciness. But has it all been done before?\nM\narguerite, with music\nby Michel Legrand\nand book by Boublil\nandSch\u00f6nberg(ofLes\nMis and Miss Saigon\nfame), has just opened at the Theatre\nRoyal Haymarket, The Theatre Royal\nHaymarket looks huge and impressive\nfrom the outside but it\u2019s tiny from the\ninside hence you\u2019ll need to get further\nback seats than you usually would.\nWhat\u2019s the bonus of this? Cheaper\ntickets!! The theatre also boasts gallery\nseats, the only theatre in the West End\nstill to do so, at a bargainalicious \u00a325.\nMargeurite is the latest in a long series of artistic pieces to based on Alexandre Dumas\u2019 La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias,\na supposedly autobiographical piece\nabout his love affair with Rose Alphonsine Plessis (later renaming herself\nMarie Du Plessis). Du Plessis was a notorious seductress, mistress and possible whore in mid-nineteenth century\nFrance. She eventually settled with an\neighty year-old Russian diplomat only\nto have an affair behind his back with\nthe penniless writer Dumas. She died\nof tuberculosis aged 23, impoverished\nand alone. Hmm\u2026 that story sounds\nfamiliar. Why it\u2019s just Moulin Rouge\u2026\noh, and of course Verdi\u2019s opera La Traviata, the 1936 film Camille and Margot Fonteyn vehicle Marguerite and\nArmand.\nThis version is set in the occupied\nFrance of World War II, amongst the\nupper classes who see the war as a big\ninconvenience- having to hold one\u2019s\ndinner party in the cellar and finishing\nbefore curfew. Just like Moulin Rouge,\nMargeurite starts at the end of the\nstory. We are addressed by a solemn\nchorus telling the audience to \u201cCome\nOne, Come All\u201d and hear the tale of\nMarguerite as the negligee-clad girl is\nbattered and dragged around the stage.\nThis made for a promising start as I\u2019m\na fan of the Baz Luhrmann-style of reversed story telling. I also like deep,\ngritty musicals; which this looked like\nit would be, considering the subject\nmatter. I was wrong.\nHalf of the first act is situated at\nMarguerite\u2019s fortieth birthday party at\nBegoetterung IX, acylic on paper (1979)\nDon\u2019t play with Nazis, children. Particularly if you\u2019re planning to fall in love with a Jewish musician later\nher lavish house owned and paid for\nby Otto, Marguerite\u2019s rich Nazi husband from whom she gets whatever\nshe wants, be it new clothes or petrol\ntokens for her friends. During this a\nMarguerite is another one of those musicals full of raunch and sex. We get a lot of that in the arts pages. Not that we\u2019re complaining\n\n"

Even if it were just\na caf\u00e9 it would it be worth the visit for its delicious selection of cakes and extensive range of coffees. (And\nfor those who do not appreciate coffee, they make an excellent pot of tea which is a hard thing to come by\nthese days). The ground floor of CCK is a shop selling a well chosen array of comics, photography, fictitious and non-fictitious books on many fetishes and other, not so deviant, sexy subjects (all tastes catered\nfor). The more prudish among you, please do not be put off: if one had no idea CCK was in any way kinky\nit would be perfectly possible to visit the caf\u00e9 and spend at least the first part of your visit blissfully unaware of what the shelves hold! The walls belie this fact, living up to the kinky nature of the establishment\nwith gorgeous art from a new artist each month; prints of past and present work are available for sale at a\nreasonable price, too.\nWhat makes CCK such a delightful place to bring a friend or spend an idle afternoon, are the friendly\nowners, unique atmosphere and the ability to read the books while enjoying your cake and coffee without\nhaving to purchase them! Portfolios of previous exhibitions are also put out next to the tables. Another\nbonus of CCK is that after 6pm you can bring your own wine (small corkage fee applies). I recommend the\nchocolate fudge cake: ridiculously indulgent served up with dollops of fudge sauce and ice cream although\nyou will not be disappointed by any of the cakes or your visit there.\nThe Troubadour\n\u201cThe best eatery West of Big Ben\u201d according to one review of this 50\u2019s coffee house on Old Brompton Road. I\nstumbled across this delightful establishment before a play at the neighbouring Finborough theatre, and was drawn\nin by its relaxed atmosphere and wooden interior which set it apart from the generic chain restaurants nearby. It\nreminded me of something you would find the other side of the Channel, perhaps in France. Indeed, that is from\nwhere the tradition of the Troubadour sprung. Composer and performer of songs, the Troubadours emerged from\n11th Century France and sung mainly of chivalry (since extinct) and courtly love. This caf\u00e9 opened in 1954 as part\nof the second coffee house revolution to hit London. These cafes became places of rebellion, new music and meeting places for groups such as the Black Panthers. Other claims to fame include being the first place where the Private Eye was distributed. Not just a caf\u00e9 serving delicious food, cocktails and more, the venue has a club downstairs\n(where Paul Simon, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zep and Bob Dylan have all jammed away) with events on every night of the\nweek, an art gallery, a deli and also The Garret: a secret hideaway luxury suite. This is an ideal place to come for a\nunique environment with a bit of history thrown in for good measure, too.\nCurzon, Soho\nThe Curzon is a small chain of independent cinemas with branches in Mayfair, Chelsea and Richmond, but the Soho branch is particularly special for its adjoining caf\u00e9 and bar. Situated on Shaftsbury Avenue, the cinema is a blessing for fans of those interesting, \u2018limited release\u2019 films directed\nby random people and starring unheard-of actors, that are not often shown at standard cinemas.\nThose who enjoy foreign films should keep an eye on the listings. Currently on is Argentine film\nXXY, black and white cartoon Persepolis, Joy Division and an array of films celebrating the 1968\nseason. Every Friday at 11.30pm is the \u2018Midnight Movies\u2019 bringing the best in \u201ccult classics, trash\nbeauties and art-house jaw droppers\u201d and this week the film is Skidoo. To enjoy the Curzon properly it is wise to arrive an hour or so before the film starts to allow time for a drink in the bar or\nfood in the caf\u00e9 upstairs. The food here is predominantly devilishly tempting sweets made by the\nbakers Konditor and Cook (utterly genius) but there is also a small array of sandwiches. The Lemon Chiffon cake goes down a treat; believe me, although you might want to add an extra ten minutes for \u2018decision time\u2019! Equally tempting is the large selection of DVDs available for purchase.\nCamden Arts Centre, cafe and garden\nAccording to the Evening Standard this is London\u2019s best contemporary art space and, despite my comparative\nlack of knowledge on contemporary art spaces, I would have to agree. With three gallery rooms, a reading room\nand a drawing room, it is rather small compared to a lot of museums but this only adds to its charm and makes\nfor a very relaxed and personal experience.\nThe interior alone is something beautiful to behold. Wooden floorboards, high ceilings, tall windows which let\nin a breeze, all make you wish you were rich enough to buy the place and convert it into a private house, complete with extensive personal art collection. Currently on show is a sculptural installation by Claire Barclay and\nthe exuberant large-scale paintings and etchings by Israeli/Danish artist, Tal R.\nWhat makes this space so special is the caf\u00e9 and garden. Set on two levels, the garden provides outside seating\nas well as some art of its own in the form of interesting benches and the odd sculpture. It truly is something\ndifferent to be in such a quaint and isolated green space in the middle of the city. The caf\u00e9 itself serves the best\ncoffee in north London, according to one source (I am not a coffee fan so can not comment, I am afraid) as well\nas cakes (yay), homemade hummus and flowering teas.\nThe Ritzy\nThe independent Ritzy cinema is a different kind of cultural offering amid an already culturally colourful borough. If you are used to seeing the more \u201cdown market\u201d side of Brixton, it is\neasy to forget where one is once inside the Ritzy and you would be forgiven for thinking you\nwere back in Soho. The film showings change weekly, unlike larger cinema chains, but the\nvariety of films on will match an Odeon or Vue. As well as providing for the \u2018masses\u2019, the Ritzy\nwill show limited release films, foreign films and even films that premier at the picture house.\nThe latest example of this was \u201cH.R. Giger Revealed\u201d, a documentary and 3D animation of\nthe artist\u2019s work with question and answer session with its director. There is a very intimate\nfeel about seeing a film here, not dissimilar to the feeling one gets when seeing a play at the\ntheatre: feeling as if we are taking part in a unique experience. The Ritzy bar allows you to\ntake alcohol and soft drinks into your film and upstairs is a very pleasant caf\u00e9 selling a gloriously smelling array of healthy (and not so healthy!) snack and light meals. Live music is put\non at the cinema bar, too, and on Friday 30 May the cinema is celebrating the advent of Sex\nand the City to British screens with Cosmopolitans in the bar and guests dressing up as their\nfavourite character.\nMy Village\nAlthough My Village is \u201cjust\u201d an organic caf\u00e9/shop, its proximity to Camden Town in all its eclectic glory warrants it a place in this week\u2019s tube map. Quite a contrast to the rest of Camden in\natmosphere, this wonderful organic haven sells delicious cakes, freshly prepared cold food as well as\nmaking amazing juices and the best hot chocolate you will taste (this coming from a hot chocolate\nsnob!). It is owned by two Kurdish brothers who clearly love and take great pride in their job and\nthis is evident by the warm welcome you will receive every time you drop by: a breath of fresh air\nwhen you are lucky to get a smile from a nameless barista in Starbucks. The d\u00e9cor is also absolutely\nbeautiful. Designed by one of the brothers himself, the wooden interior resembles Moroccan tea\nroom fused with French farmhouse and tables are available outside if one feels the urge to watch the\nebb and flow of interesting folk passing through Chalk Farm Road. The perfect oasis to refuel mid or\npost-shopping and to escape the market dust.\nPulkra\nPulkra is the height of health and before you shudder at the thought of dry Ryvita and oil-free salad, take a look at what\nPulkra offers. A clean and airy feel will welcome you and your stomach will growl when beholding the array of freshly prepared home-made foods out on display. Pulkra is also a yoga studio, feeding your mind and soul as well as your body, and\nits location on Fulham Road is perfect for those at Imperial wanting an escape from college life or Ethos, or somewhere\nwhich offers a huge number of daily classes to choose from.\nBeing Italian run, it is therefore no surprise that the quality of the food and the delicious home-made gelato and sorbets\nare magnificent. They are all made the \u201cartisan way\u201d with the finest ingredients, fresh whole milk and unrefined sugar.\nThe sorbets are completely free of dairy, great news for the lactose intolerant or anyone watching their figures with the\nswimsuit season fast approaching, or for anyone who just loves good food such as myself. Self-confessed cake junkie, I\nwas definitely not let down by their cakes which are all homemade and also wheat free, although wheat tolerant persons\nshould not be put off by that fact. Pulkra in the Park is another branch on Eel Brook Common (a short walk from Fulham\nBroadway), which is quieter and allows you to enjoy your food on the grass, in the sunshine (fingers crossed).\nWritten by Caz Knight, designed by Rosie Grayburn\nThe Great Culture Crawl\nChapter Eleven \u2013 Not your average caf\u00e9s...\n\n"

Current Red Cross stocks are unlikely to\nlast the week, and the rain is not expected to stop any\ntime soon. The combination of appalling weather, lack\nof emergency supplies and poor hygiene are devastating\nthe country, where a state of national emergency may\nsoon be called.\nAmnesty Report\nEngland\nAmnesty International\u2019s annual report was released\nearlier this week, reporting on human rights legislation\nand abuses around the world. This is the organization\u2019s\nsixtieth such report, and is as outspoken as it has ever\nbeen, referring to a world \u2018riven by inequality, scarred by\ndiscrimination and distorted by political repression.\u2019 The\nUS, China and Zimbabwe all pass under the microscope,\nwith numerous criticisms of Guantanamo Bay, ethnic\npersecution in China, and the \u2018deplorable conditions\u2019 in\nZimbabwe. The 398 page report, as always, compares\nfigures on issues such as torture, unfair trials and\nfreedom of speech in countries around the world, and is\navailable online.\nI\nt\u2019s a comparatively upbeat double page this time\nround, with murderers being convicted, peace sum-mitsbeingheld,monarchies\nbeing dissolved and the occasional\nelection taking place. The only real\ncloud over the general festivities\nis the continued flooding in Colombia, which has recently taken\na significant turn for the worse.\nOh well; we couldn\u2019t really take\nour news seriously unless someone somewhere was suffering.\nBut just look at what\u2019s happening\nin Nepal \u2013 a country with regions\ncompared by some to a Dark Age\nEurope. A dictatorial monarchy\nwas first relieved of all power,\nand has now been abolished.\nCelebrations in the street, no reported violence; a new republic\nhas peacefully been brought into\nthe world. It\u2019s a touching sight.\nThe former Marxist dictator\nof Ethiopia, who has been living in comfort chez Mugabe for\nthe past seventeen years, has\njust been awarded the death sentence in absentia. I find it deeply\nunsettling that the nightmarish\nrule of Mengistu Haile Mariam\nis so little is mentioned in the\nWestern world. Still, we\u2019ve got\nbetter, right? We would know\nand care more if people were being murdered in Africa today.\nOn a bittersweet note, Amnesty\nInternational has published its annual report. The world is a place\nwhere terrible things can still hap-pen, but fortunately fewer pass\nunnoticed. I suggest you at least\nread a summary of AI\u2019s report; I\u2019m\nnot their biggest fan, but they have\na lot of important things to say.\nEthiopian Dictator\nEthiopia\nMengistu Haile Mariam, Ethiopia\u2019s former President,\nhas been sentenced to death in absentia by a court in his\nhome country. Mengistu was forced to leave Ethiopia\nin 1991, ending a 17-year term described as employing\n\u2018one of the most systematic uses of mass murder by\na state ever witnessed in Africa.\u2019 The \u2018Red Terror\u2019 of\n1977-8 is believed to be the seventh worst genocide in\nhuman history, killing hundreds of thousands of men,\nwomen and children. Mengistu has since been living in\nZimbabwe, and is unlikely to be extradited while Mugabe\nremains in power.\nGilead Amit\n\n"

    "content": "arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n13\nFriday 30 May 2008 felix\nArts\nbomb goes off, leading to an extreme\ncase of love at first sight as Marguerite\nfalls for Armand, a penniless musician\n(hmm, familiar?!). The rest of the first\nhalf is spent with the two lovers pining over each other. The introduction\nof a subplot adds a welcome break; also\nin Armand\u2019s jazz band are his sister\nAnnette and her Jewish lover Lucien,\nwho get caught up in a resistance ring\nwhilst Lucien is trying to leave for the\nIndependent South of France. I felt\nthis storyline was much worthier and\nthe chemistry more genuine than the\nMarguerite and Armand story, which\nseemed fleeting and meaningless.\nThe Annette/Lucien storyline developed further in the second act with\nAnnette being taken and tortured by\nthe Gestapo, but somehow managing\nto escape thanks to Marguerite\u2019s manipulation of Otto. Here the storyline\njust seems to stop, with Annette and\nLucien only appearing at the end for\ntheir bows. I really wished this storyline had been developed further as it\nwas a glimpse of what the show could\nhave been. So, back to the main plot.\nMarguerite spends the second act doing just what she did in the first act,\nfalling in and out of love with Armand\nand Otto and eventually being forced\nto dump Armand in exchange for his\nfamily not being hurt. This scene was\ndone much better in Moulin Rouge\nwith the heartbreaking \u2018Tango de Roxanne\u2019 and its ensuing scenes. Then\nsuddenly the atmosphere changes with\nthe finale reverting back to a chilling\nreprise of \u201cCome One, Come All\u201d complete with more beating up, removal\nof clothes and cutting of Marguerite\u2019s\nhair, making for a harrowing finale. I\nleft the theatre feeling satisfied\u2026 until\nabout the tube journey home, when I\nrealised I was satisfied by only half-an\n-hour of a two hour show.\nThe best thing about Marguerite was\nMichel Lagrand\u2019s spellbinding music.\nBut the mixture was not quite right;\nthere were too many love songs and\nYou can\u2019t tell in this picture, but they\u2019re doing that up against a piano. Wouldn\u2019t that hurt? In case you wondered, that young man all over\nMarguerite is Armand the nice young Jewish musician who steals her heart. He\u2019s played by Julien Ovenden\nonly one exposition setting song (\u201cDay\nby Day\u201d), although this was cleverly\nsplit into four parts to move the plot\nalong at particularly slow points. For\nme, stand-out songs were \u201cIntoxication\u201d- a strong, well-executed contrapuntal number between Marguerite, Armand and Otto, \u201cTake Good\nCare of Yourself\u201d- the Act One finale\nmuch in the style of \u201cOne Day More\u201d,\nthe Act One finale from Boublil and\nSch\u00f6nberg\u2019s biggest hit, Les Miserables, with overlapping motifs and a\nrevolving stage (yep, you can\u2019t have a\nBoublil and Schoenberg without a re-volve), And \u201cThe Face I See\u201d- the best\nof Marguerite\u2019s \u2018yearning for love\u2019 type\nsongs. The set was also magnificent,\nwith a faded grandeur of marble and\nelegant architecture. It was cleverly designed so that the actors could be terribly lazy and never just walk off stage\n\u2013 everything was brought on and off\nautomatically.\nAlthough they gave competent per-formances, the three leads \u2013 Ruthie\nHenshall (Marguerite), Julien Ovenden (Armand) and Alexander Hanson (Otto) \u2013 seemed slightly miscast.\nMarguerite is supposed be celebrating\nher fortieth birthday yet Henshall appears much younger and Armand is\nthe \u2018young musician\u2019 roughly twenty\nyears her junior but seems older. This\nmade the relationship between the pair\ndifficult to justify and detracted from\nthe believability of the story. The supporting cast did well with the material\nthey had, especially Armand\u2019s friends\nLucien (Simon Thomas), Annette (An-nalene Beechey) and Pierrot (Matt\nCross) who gave tender, heartbreaking\nperformances.\nThe failings of Marguerite lie largely\nin its book, which doesn\u2019t stand up to\nthe sombre setting of Occupied France\nand the reputation of the \u201cfilles aux boches\u201d (women who slept with Germans\nduring the war). The storyline is basic\nand shallow, with only the Lucien/Annette subplot to satisfy anyone wishing\nfor a serious musical about the politics\nof upper-class France in World War\nII. The pacing was also patchy, nothing would happen for a long time and\nthen suddenly the plot would move at a\ntremendous pace. The characters were\nunderdeveloped caricatures; the German is boring and serious whilst the\nFrench are flirty and sexy. This makes\nit difficult for the cast to truly shine.\nIf you want a nice love story that happens to be set in France in the forties\nsee Marguerite, if you want a serious\npiece about World War II, go see Cabaret instead.\nMarguerite is on until 1st\nNovember 2008 at Theatre Royal\nHaymarket, so you\u2019ve got plenty\nof time to go see it!\nHere is Marguerite, the star of the show. Played by Ruthie Henshall. Whore or heroine? Watch the show and make your judgement\n\n"

I had\ndecided to take advantage of both Air\nChina\u00b4s free stopover, and the fact that\nmy close friend was on a University\nexchange there, and could thus act as\nmy personal guide during my five-day\nvisit. I found, in fact, that five days was\nnot nearly enough time to come to\ngrips with this hugely overwhelming\ncity, but I hope to at least to get a taste\nof what\u2019s on offer.\nThese days, nobody can hear of the\nplace Beijing without instantly associating it with the Olympics. Or Tibet.\nOr both simultaneously. In a similar\nway, nobody can visit Beijing without\nbecoming aware that the Olympics\nare being held there in a matter of\nmonths \u2013 and that would include even\nthe most ignorant child, blind person,\ndeaf, alcoholic or otherwise incapacitated person. For the kids, there are the\nsomewhat uncharismatic new Olympic mascots \u2013 BeiBei, JingJing, Huanhuan, YingYing and NiNi.

A\nshame really, as the odd game of \u00b4dodge\nthe spit\u00b4 never goes amiss. Then there\nare the huge boards which have been\nerected on every street corner, with a\nglaring electronic countdown being\nshown to the precise second. (Having\ncome back to England, I\u00b4ve noted that\nthese are a particularly popular choice\nof background for BBC news presenters on anything Olympic related. To\nbe honest, I realise that\u00b4s a rather dull\nfact....) For the alcoholics, there is the\nnew Olympic Cocktail, which I can\n22 felix Friday 30 May 2008\nply not seeming to act as a deterrent.\nI meekly pulled out my Lonely Planet\nand flipped to the Language section,\nonly to realise that like in most situations abroad, phrases such as \u201cI need\na mechanic\u201d or even \u201ccould you repeat\nthat please\u201d were not particularly going to help me out. I like to think he\nwas giving me a personal tour for the\njourney. Upon arriving at my destina-tion, he refused to hand over my luggage until he had found some English\nspeakers who could translate \u2013 \u201cwhy\nare you going to this station?\u201d and\n\u201cwhy do you want to be driven here?\u201d\nThe fact that I was meeting my friend\nseemed to satisfy him \u2013 otherwise, I\nassume he would have held my luggage\nhostage until I agreed to be driven to\nwherever my train was supposed to\ntake me. Either way, I was then left\ntell you nothing about, either because\nit was unmemorable or because I had\nalready had a few too many for it to be\nmemorable. Not to mention that vast\nnumber of construction sites that are\ncurrently taking over the city, that are\nall to be completed before the Olympics, or the fact that my friend on exchange with Beijing University informs\nme that all her Chinese conversation\nclasses now centre around... wait for\nit... the Olympics.\nMy first day and first proper encounter with a true Beijing-ian was the taxi\ndriver who drove me from the airport\nto the station, where I was to meet my\nfriend. I wasn\u00b4t sure if I aggravated him\nby having a bad hair day, but he proceeded to shout at me for the entirety\nof the trip in Chinese, with my obvious\nlack of understanding of Chinese or re-with my luggage on the sidewalk, wondering how the hell I was supposed to\nlocate my friend in this mad environ-ment, where cars were racing past me\nas though they were on the M25, and\npeople were crushing past me on all\nsides as though I was at Glastonbury.\nNevertheless, after a painful half hour\nof navigating myself with two suitcases\n(I hate Japan for being such a shopping mecca) past all the human traffic,\nI managed to locate a phone and then\ncursed myself a thousand times whilst\nwaiting for my friend. Never again\nwould I tell her not to bother skipping\nclass to greet me at the airport, or even\nworse, not bother arranging to meet in\nan exact place. It felt similar to a mission of trying to re-locate someone at\nGlastonbury without having a mobile.\nThe sight of the head that bobbed a\ngood twenty centimetres above the\nrest of the Chinese crowd as I caught\nsight of her walking towards me, is one\nthat remains one of the most beautiful\nvisions during my trip in Beijing.\nThe next day, I experienced a whole\nother type of beauty. The Summer\nPalace was to be my first tourist des-tination. The UNESCO world heritage\ndescribes it as being an \u201coutstanding\nexpression of the creative art of Chinese landscape garden design, incorporating the works of humankind and\nnature in a harmonious whole\u201d which\nI\u00b4m not fully certain I can decipher,\nbut I\u00b4m certain that the gardens there\nwere some of the most stunning I had\never seen, as well as being the largest. It\nappeared that the crowds had decided\nto visit en masse at the same time as\nme, but I quickly adjusted to the fact\nthat in Beijing, hoardes of tourists were\nthe norm, with there being probably at\nleast ten times as many as I was used\nto in a particular attraction. Considering its huge population and the vast\namount of culture to be seen within\nChina, this isn\u00b4t actually surprising.\nHaving said this, I found that it was\ndifficult for anything to retract from its\nbeauty. The walk to the hill on which\nThe Summer Palace itself stands is incredibly rewarding. After climbing the\nnever-ending steps with ornamental\ndetail rivalling that within the Vatican,\nyou\u2019re then greeted with a breathtaking view across the vast Lake Kunming.\nSuddenly, the rest of the world was forgotten and it left me imagining myself\nbeing transported back to the time of\nEmpress Cixi and the 19th century.\n...and more on Beijing to come soon.\nBiazarrely enough, I find myself writing from an internet cafe in Buenos\nAires, with my time about to cut off at\nthe internet cafe. So apologies for the\nabrupt ending.\nOne of the entrances to the Summer Palace in Beijing. The climb to the top is not to be taken lightly\nThe traffic in Beijing stretches as far as the eye can see Friendlies! China\u2019s cuddly Olympic mascots\n\n"

After one year of NUS membership, the Union has called for another referendum\nTom Roberts\nEditor-in-Chief\nLast week, Imperial College Union\n(ICU) confirmed that a referendum\non NUS (National Union of Students)\nmembership will take place at the end\nof this term. The decision was confirmed after ICU Council voted almost\nunanimously for the referendum, with\n24 committee members voting yes,\none voting no, and the final person\nabstaining.\nThe referendum has been pencilled\nin for the last two weeks of term, taking place from 17th to 23rd June. The\nentire student body is eligible to vote\nand the question posed to them will be:\n\u201cShould Imperial College Union disaf-fliate from the NUS?\u201d to which they\nmust vote \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019.\nThe last referendum was called only\n18 months ago. At that time students\nwere asked to consider if the Union\nshould join the NUS or not. A slight\nmajority of 53% favoured rejoining,\nleading to ICU reaffiliating for the\nfourth time in its long and protracted\nhistory with the NUS. But after a year of\nNUS membership fraught with farcical\nconferences and few tangible benefits\nto the main student populace, ICU has\ndecided that spending \u00a344,000 per year\non membership is a waste of money.\nCalls for a referendum began circulating soon after April\u2019s NUS Annual Conference 2008. Major reforms\nthat the NUS had been striving for\nthroughout this academic year were\nmet with even fiercer opposition at\nthe conference than before, leading to\ntheir rejection, much to ICU\u2019s distress.\nUltimately, the prospect of undergoing another year of fruitless attempts\nat reformation has triggered this year\u2019s\nreferendum. The Union is now pressing to leave the NUS before the end of\nterm, otherwise it will have to shell out\nanother \u00a344,000 for a further year of\naffiliation.\nICU has been criticised for its timing of the referendum by last year\u2019s\nPresident, John Collins, who told Felix\nthat although he understands the \u201crationale\u201d behind the review, he doesn\u2019t\n\u201cthink the timing of the vote is particularly fair.\u201d\nIndeed, the timing of the voting period is key to this year\u2019s referendum.\n15% of the student body (approxi-mately 1,800) is required to vote for\nthe referendum to be valid, but with\nmany students still undergoing exams,\nthere are fears within the Union that\nthe minimum number of voters might\nnot be obtained, regardless of the overall result. Mr Collins is quick to point\nthis out stating that: \u201cVoter turnout\nin the summer term has historically\nbeen very poor so I would be surprised\nLeft, current ICU President, Steve Brown gives a speech during April\u2019s NUS Annual Conference 2008. With 25 more votes in favour of some major reformations, ICU probably wouldn\u2019t be calling for a referendum. Right, the front cover of Felix when the result of last year\u2019s referendum was\nannounced. John Collins (second from left) \u201closes his cool\u201d as Steve Brown (far right) \u201cexpresses his dissatisfaction.\u201d My, how it\u2019s all changed...\nif more than a few hundred students\nvote.\u201d\nTo put the situation in context, 1,800\nvotes is on a par with the very high\nturnout in last term\u2019s Sabbatical elec-tions, however, the target was easily\nsurpassed in the previous NUS referendum during Autumn 2006 when\nover 4,000 students voted.\nThis year\u2019s Sabbatical Officers have\na drastically different stance on the\nNUS compared to their counterparts\nof last year. Deputy President Education & Welfare (DPEW), Kirsty Patterson, will be fronting the disaffiliation\ncampaign, aided by current President,\nSteve Brown, who led last year\u2019s anti-NUS campaign and is famed for slating\nthe institution as a \u201ccomedy sideshow.\u201d\nBoth of their predecessors led the pro-NUS party to victory during the last\nreferendum, however, this year\u2019s team\nis still in the embryonic stages of devel-opment; the pro-NUS group has only\njust recently appointed a campaign\nleader and is currently in the process\nof expanding its team.\nOnce again, Felix will be teaming-up\nwith Imperial College news website\nLive! (live.cgcu.net) over the coming\nweeks to bring you discussion about\nthe NUS, what it provides students\nwith, and arguments for and against\ndisafilliation from both campaign\nteams. In issue 1,407, we will be collating everyone\u2019s views in time for the\nstart of voting.\nFelix reiterates what it said last year\non the subject of the NUS: please think\ncarefully about the ramifications that\ndisaffiliation may have upon the Union\nbefore voting in June, and that such a\ndecision should not be made lightly.\nThe pro-NUS team is sorely\nlacking in members. If you want\nto join their campaign team, or\nhelp with the NUS disaffiliation\ngroup, get in contact with the\nreferendum\u2019s Returning Officer,\nAlistair Cott, on dpcs@imperial.\nac.uk.\nIf you want your views on the\nNUS to be published in Felix and\non Live! contact comment.felix@\nimperial.ac.uk or editor@cgcu.net\nrespectively.\nnumbers, this means more than\n4,000 students voted.\nThough many around the Union\nhad been predicting a landslide either way, the final result came very\nclose, with only 261 votes separating the two camps.\nA th lt d\nStudents say yes to NUS\nImperial College Union will affiliate\nto the National Union of Students\n(NUS), pending approval by the\nNUS conference, after the refer-d lt d l t\nThe student newspaper\nof Imperial College\nNo. 1,365 \u2022 Friday \u2022\n24 November 2006 \u2022\nfelixonline.co.uk\nfelix\nfelix\nAndy Sykes\nEditor-in-chief\nJohn Collins, Union President,\nsaid he was \u201cdelighted [with] what\nhas become the largest union\ndemocratic exercise ever to take\nplace at Imperial\u201d.

The approval\ncame this week during a presentation\nto College\u2019s Strategic Education Committee (SEC) made by Officers from\nthe Union.\nCurrently, Imperial\u2019s PhD students\nare defined as \u2018full-time\u2019 for the first\nthree years of their doctorate. Most\nstudents are then granted \u2018writing-up\u2019\nstatus for six months whilst they complete their thesis; however, they lose\nvarious privileges such as access to\nthe library, swipe card access around\ncampus and full-time status. The latter means they are also required to pay\nCouncil Tax.\nThe situation varies throughout the\ncountry, with different rules for students depending on the institution they\nattend. Ultimately, the privileges given\nto a writing-up student are decided\nby their university, and over the coming months Imperial\u2019s academic staff\nwill be revising their own criteria. It\u2019s\ncurrently unclear the extent to which\nwriting-up postgraduates at Imperial\nwill be classed as full-time students,\nsince some of the existing restrictions\nplaced upon them will likely remain.\nHowever, those students can expect\nto be exempt from paying Council Tax\nwhen the classification of a writing-up\nstudent is eventually redefined and put\ninto effect.\n\u201cWe now have the committee\u2019s [SEC]\nsupport,\u201d commented Imperial College\nUnion President, Steve Brown, \u201cand\nhopefully the revisions will be in place\nfor the next academic year.\u201d\nSeemingly, the revisions are very\nunlikely to help students, such as Matthew Yong (issue 1,404), who are currently battling with their local Councils over unpaid Council Tax. If Mr\nYong was declared a full-time student\nduring his writing-up period, it would\npotentially pave the way for numerous\nother ex-postgraduates to claim Council Tax exemption for the duration of\ntheir writing-up phases.\nCollege will revise its definition of a writing-up student\nPoorest students restricted\nto six hours work per week?\nTom Roberts\nEditor-in-Chief\nStudents who receive a bursary should\nbe working no longer than six hours\nper week, that\u2019s according to regulations imposed by College\u2019s Payroll de-partment. The restriction has been in\nplace for many years now, though it was\nseemingly dormant.\nRecently, however, College has begun\nto impose the regulations more strin-gently; specifically when Payroll told\nDeputy President Finance & Services\n(DPFS), Chris Larvin, that the Union\nshouldn\u2019t be paying numerous members of their casual staff (ie: bar staff and\nstewards) who are exceeding the limit.\nStudy Support Bursaries are sums\nof money awarded to Home students\nevery year, and the amount depends on\ntheir family\u2019s income. They range from\n\u00a350 to \u00a33,000, and are intending to\ncover \u201cmaintenance and study related\ncosts.\u201d\nThe exact reason why the six hour\nworking restriction exists is \u201cuncertain\u201d\naccording to Mr Larvin, which raises\nthe question of why they are even necessary in the first place.\nBursaries are intended to be given to\nthe poorest undergraduates, and despite student loans being inflated for\nthose based in London, many students\nstill find it very difficult to live off just\ntheir loan and bursary. Potentially, this\nleaves students affected by the six hour\nworking limit left in a quandary where\nthey can\u2019t afford not to work, but if they\ndo, they will be violating the Bursary\ncontact.\nIt\u2019s believed that many students are\nunknowingly breaching this rule, how-ever, as long as they are working fewer\nthan 48 hours per week, they are not\nbreaking the law.\nThere are further complications when\nstudents who do not receive a bursary\nare involved, since they can work in excess of 20 hours per week, depending\non visa requirements; something Mr\nLarvin feels is a \u201cdouble standard\u201d in\nterms of students\u2019 welfare.\nPresently, the Deputy President Education & Welfare, Kirsty Patterson, is\nin communication with College staff\nand hopes the issues will be ironed out\nsoon.\n\n"

We hope to repeat this\nsuccess at other regattas across the\ncountry over the coming weeks, culminating in our main goal, the Henley\nWomen\u2019s Regatta at the end of June.\nBoat Club\u2019s Senior women\u2019s squad enjoy\nwaffles, ice-cream, chocolate and sweet victory\nHelen Waller\nMun Kee keeps a close eye on the boats\n\n"

    "content": "comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment\nGilead Amit\nFeminism \u2013 are we right to laugh?\n\u201c\nDo we\nstill need an\nanachronous\nequal rights\nmovement\nin today\u2019s\nenlightened\nsociety? Yes, I\nbelieve so\n\u201d\nA\ns I write this, it occurs to\nme that I\u2019m very much\nout-on-a-limbing myself.\nI\u2019m far from being an\nexpert on issues of gender \u2013 even less of an expert on issues\nof sex, might I add facetiously \u2013 and\nGod knows I lack the necessary qualifications to discuss feminism from the\nright side of the playing field. Nevertheless, I like to think of myself as an\nintelligent, open-minded male member of society, and I believe that gives\nme some right to deal with a topic that\naffects us all mentally, morally, emotionally and sociologically.\nIn my limited personal experience,\nI\u2019ve heard a great deal of exasperated\ndenunciation of feminism. Both men\nand women of my generation seem fed\nup of hearing provocative talk of equal\nopportunities and glass ceilings. I don\u2019t\ndoubtthatrepresentativesofothergen-erations feel the same way; I just imagine they feel less comfortable saying so.\nWhen pressed, however, the majority\nof people admit that the fundamental message of equality is a valid one.\nWhat they object to is the \u2018unnecessary\nextremism\u2019. Extremism in the way people feel the message is being rammed\ndown their throats, and unnecessary\nin that people believe the main goal of\nfeminism has been granted, and that\nthe persistence of the movement itself\nis a redundant left-over from a more\noppressive period.\nAs a result, the obvious questions\npour forth: is there any more work\nleft to do? Does our society need to\nget any better? Do we still need an\nanachronous equal rights movement\nin today\u2019s enlightened society? These\nquestions are a little blunt for me. I do\nnot have the statistics or, as I never tire\nof telling you, the personal experience\nto say if today\u2019s society is an equal one.\nBut, I hasten to add, I doubt it. I am as\ncertain as I can be without bothering to\ndo serious research that there is still a\nlong way to go for practical equality to\nbe reached. In any case, that\u2019s not the\narea that interests me. What interests\nme is if such practical equality is even\npossible, let alone within our reach.\nThere is no escaping the fact that the\ndifferences between the genders are\nand always have been an intrinsic part\nof our society. Whether it be in our\nchoice of pronouns, our perception of\na family\u2019s principal breadwinner, or the\nchoice of careers one feels comfortable\nin pursuing, the weight of historical\nprejudice inevitably piles up on our\nshoulders.\nTake a look around you, if you happen to be at College, and work out the\nfemale:male ratio. If it\u2019s greater than 1:2\nI\u2019m sure that somebody will be happy\nto pay ready cash to know where you\u2019re\nsitting. Those of us who are aware of\nthe gender bias at Imperial are willing\nto make light of it, but it nonetheless\nexists \u2013 and more significantly, it\u2019s not\nconsidered surprising.\nSociety has come to accept the differences between men and women,\nand extrapolates what it believes to\nbe necessary differences in their corresponding lifestyles. The physical and\nemotional rollercoaster of pregnancy\nremains the defining element in the\nimbalance, and helps to explain away\nalmost all of the differences in the way\nthe genders are treated. But does it still\nhave to be that way? Medical alternatives to in utero aside, there are elements of the male perception of women that rest uneasy.\nThe use of gender-inclusive nouns is\nstill sometimes seen as a target of ridi-cule: another useless invention of the\npolitical correctness squad. It seems\nto me that such critics are missing the\npoint. The evolution of our language\nexplains away its inherent chauvinism,\nbut it doesn\u2019t do anything to justify it.\nHalf of the users of our language \u2013 a\nmore educated half, by recent figures \u2013\nare female. Half of the users of our language are made to feel as though they\nare not represented by it. Some women\nhave no objection, that\u2019s fine, but they\nare more than entitled to have one. A\nlanguage that refers to the male of our\nspecies by the same word as used to\ndescribe the collective, that treats officials as masculine as a matter of course,\ndoes nothing to advance ideas of equal-ity. No tremendous fuss need be made\nover this topic anymore: what remains\nthe key issue is what people think and\nnot what they say. If a man talks about\n\u201cpolicemen\u201d and \u201cchairmen\u201d, the only\nreal objection to have is if it does not\noccur to him that a woman could fulfil\nthose roles with as much success as a\nman could. Precision of speech is no\nindicator of precision of thought, and a\nsanitized tongue is likely to be the most\nin need of cleaning.\nThis battle can be said to be won, for\neven if the linguistic bias remains, the\nmotivation for it is disappearing. The\nsame enlightened spirit that purged\nour dictionary pages of \u201cjewing\u201d and\n\u201cgypping\u201d as synonyms for theft will\ngnaw at our consciences as much for\n\u201cMan\u201d and \u201cMankind\u201d. But what about\nour thoughts? What about our perceptions and preferences? Are they inherently sexist as well? Yes, I believe so.\nCenturies of art, literature and cinema\ninfluence our reactions in every conceivable way, and that certainly applies\nto questions of gender. Our image of\nfamily life, to take an obvious exam-ple, is fraught with stereotypes \u2013 roles\nwe naturally attribute to either gender.\nWhile it is now perfectly acceptable for\na woman to be a major earner in any\nhousehold, the idea of her being the\nprincipal breadwinner is uncomfortable for some. In addition to which,\nwho takes care of the children? Who\ntakes care of the household? Should\nthe wife be the one who prepares the\nmeals? The more questions I ask, the\nmore inconsistencies I perceive in my\nknee-jerk responses.\nWe do think in a gender-based way,\nwhich is perfectly acceptable. We\nshould not, however, allow this to lead\nus to irrational conclusions based on\nnon-existent differences. Yes, it is difficult \u2013 both difficult and uncomfortable \u2013 to shake off some of these more\nresilient stereotypes. Much as our language risked becoming more burdensome with the partial elimination of\ngender, our society seems ready to fall\napart at the seams if we reject the traditional male/female roles. Nevertheless; apart from the theoretical moral\nconsiderations, it is only possible to\nachieve real balance if the scales undergo recalibration.\nAnd I have hope in the recalibration\nprocess. The prejudices of generations\nunfamiliar with the concept of women\nin charge have faded to an astounding\ndegree. By continuous exposure to capable women, fictional and real, we no\nlonger find it unusual for women to be\naccomplished at things previously the\nprerogative of men. If we change the\nparadigm enough in our lifetime, then\nfuture generations will, in their turn,\ngrow up without even the most persistent of our cultural hang-ups.\nJellybean\nA lesson from Norman\nF\nor the price you pay, you\nhalf expect Sainsbury\u2019s basic\nonions not to be onions at\nall, so it brings some solace\nwhen you need a whole box\nof Kleenex just to stay the tears generated when making a simple curry.\nOf course the peeling and slicing operation will take until next Tuesday because they are so darn small, but hey,\nyou saved a good 30p. (Incidentally, in\ncase you are the budget type you might\nbe interested to hear that you can get\nan entire jar of Basics curry for a mere\n5 English pence. Don\u2019t ask me how\nthat works out in terms of profit gen-eration, just keep your will up to date\nand roll with it.) I have recently grown\nemotionally attached to a Sainsbury\u2019s\nbasic onion on a less superficial level;\nwhilst Norman has not made me cry,\nI have experienced perhaps a glimpse\nof some of the joys of parenthood in\nwatching him grow. I would describe\nthe feeling as one akin to the satisfaction of taking in an abandoned puppy.\nLeft to die in a cupboard with the rest\nof his litter Norman stood little chance\nbefore I came along.\n\u201cWho put the onions here? We never\nput them here, we don\u2019t even use this\ncupboard. Woah! Look at them growing\u2026 wait\u2026 what does an onion plant\nlook like?\u201d Google could easily have\nanswered me and Norman may never\nhave been, but I was determined to\nfind out the hard way. I took him in,\ngave him a place to sleep, even bought\nflower food for him at one stage. It\nwas an emotional roller coaster as he\nstruggled to grow up and fulfill his\ndreams. But yes, Basics onions can\ngrow long lush green leaves. They can\nescape their upbringing and be who\nthey were made to be if you just give\nthem the chance. The cheapness and\nGM-ness of them doesn\u2019t take away the\nfact that amazingly they are still living\nand still more complex than anything\nthat mankind has managed to make. If\nApple made an onion, or even for that\nmatter an apple, you would have to sell\noff both your kidneys and get a mortgage to get hold of one. People would\nfinally stop choosing to deck out their\ncars in white, black and chrome so that\nthey look like iPods but would take to\nwrapping them in layers of brown pa-per. Stylish.\nSo Norman is a success story from\nhumble beginnings, a role-model for\nmany of us. His old life was somewhat\nanalogous to the lives of IC bioengi-neers, who despite having \u2018bio\u2019 in their\nname have dwelt until now in perhaps\nthe most lifeless and dark pit on cam-pus; the MechEng basement. Even\nyou my friends, have a future. Don\u2019t\nlet your surroundings define you. Of\ncourse the same goes to the CivEng\u2019ers,\nwho are forced to study in the least architecturally inspiring building owned\nby Imperial. That said, I\u2019m afraid even\nthe national phone book is against you.\nSee Exhibit A.\nSay hello to Norman, nurtured\nfrom poor health and now\nexuberant with life\nExhibit A\nSexism: Germaine Greer thinks it\u2019s naughty\n8 felix Friday 30 May 2008\n\n"

These sprints,\nhowever, were a mere warm-up for the\nmore serious 2,000m BUSA University\nChampionships. Over forty Universities from across the UK descended on\nStrathclyde in Glasgow over the Bank\nHoliday weekend from May 3rd - 5th.\nSport Imperial acknowledged their\nheavy reliance on ICBC to account\nfor the lion\u2019s share of Imperial\u2019s BUSA\npoints and with this in mind, Sport Imperial provided generous funding for\nall squads to make the journey north to\nScotland during the busy exam period.\nOrganisation of entry details, flights,\nhotels and boat-loading seemed an\nepic and never-ending chore, taking\ntheir toll on Head Coach Steve Trapmore in the lead up to the competition.\nWith entrants in 27 different catego-ries, flights and accommodation were\narranged to suit each individual in\norder to get students back to London\nfor exams as quickly as possible. Most\nrowers were racing on Saturday and\nhad flights booked for Friday night.\nOthers would join us later depending\non their event and race schedule.\nAfter a disappointing last minute\npull-out from the WJ4+ entry due to\na double-entry regulation, the novice\nwomen had no race scheduled until\nSunday. This left Saturday open for a\npractice session on the lake and a perfectly good excuse to purchase some\nros\u00e9 at the Duty Free. After a short\nflight to Glasgow International Airport\nfrom Heathrow and an annoyingly\nlonger wait for our bags, we were met\nby Steve and Nigel Atkins. Two mini\nbuses were hired and those instructed to bring licenses stepped forward\nwhile the rest of us piled around the\nbuses. Then John Dick informed us he\nhad never driven in the UK before, or\nused manual drive. The queue for his\nbus made a swift bee-line for the other\none. ICBC pensioners Claire Waterworth and Clarice Chung were eligible\nfor insurance and accepted the daunting task of driving the squads around\nfor the weekend.\nThe Menzies hotel in Glasgow City\nand the Alona hotel adjacent to the\nracing grounds in Motherwell would\nbe our home for the next few days. The\nfour star accommodation courtesy of\nSport Imperial was greatly appreciated\nallowing squads a decent night\u2019s sleep\nand a chance for revision. It was late\non Friday when we arrived, slowed by\nthe argumentative gear box in Clarice\u2019s\nbus, so it was bed early for racing crews\nthe next day.\nKeen for our free buffet breakfast,\nClarice and I were prompt in dressing\nand making our way into the dining\nroom for 8 am before our scheduled\ndeparture for the park at 9:15. It was\nanother forty-five minutes before anyone else appeared. Clarice was weighing in for lightweight on Sunday so I\ngenerously picked up the calorie slack\non her behalf. Alex McLaren initiated a\nmass food smuggle and crew members\nwaddled out of the breakfast room\nwith bananas and yoghurts stuffed into\nall available orifices. Various strategies were tried with newspaper folding\nproving a popular choice. While most\nof us attempted some form of subtlety\nTom Sutherland requested more bread\nfrom the waiter to prepare his sandwiches for later. With time pressing on\nwe headed for the bus leaving a trail of\nNutella packets and filo pastry behind\nus; well foddered for the first day of\ncompetitive racing.\nA somewhat disappointing opening day for Imperial on Saturday with\nthe MC2x, MCL2-, MC4+, MC4- unable to make it into the finals, whilst\nthe MJ2x came fourth in a straight fi-nal. The MN8+ were more successful\ncruising past the first heat, making it\npast a tougher semi-final only to lose\nout on a medal position by one place in\nthe final. Ending the day on a positive\nnote and setting the standard for the\nrest of the crews, the WC4+ composed\nof Jenny Forrester at stroke, Erica\nThompson at 3, Claire Waterworth at\n2, Clarice Chung at bow and coxed by\nConnie Pidoux dominated their heats\nresulting in gold in the final race.\nAt the end of a tiring opening day the\nWC4+ medals were collected and we\ntrundled back to the bus and headed\nto the hotel. Clarice followed Steve\u2019s\nquestionable navigational skills and we\neventually got back on the right route.\nClarice\u2019s driving skills and quick reactions were put to the test when a car\nveered across our lane in front of the\nbus to take a left turn off the rounda-bout. Minor damaged resulted, mostly\nto the ego of the other driver.\nSafely back at the hotel we showered\nand met in the lobby. With lightweight\nweigh-in now less than 24 hours away,\nClarice heroically opted for a run instead of dinner. The rest of us took\nour grumbling stomachs into the city\nof Glasgow for some hot, Italian food.\nService was slow with Jenny Forrester\nseconds from releasing the twins and\nrequesting faster service. Soon the\nplates of steaming pasta and loaded\npizzas came out and all hungry rowers\nwere fed.\nThe evening was rounded off with\na quick trip to the local Tesco and we\nstocked up on Nutri-grain bars, Frostie\ncereal bars, bananas and malt loaves.\nI settled on multiple packets of fruit\ngums; the fuel of athletes.\nIt was an early start the next morn-ing; too early to avail of the buffet\nbreakfast so we decided to order room\nservice. With an admittedly long request list Anna was cut-off in mid\nflow. Refusing to forego the toast and\njam she redialled and responded to the\ngood morning message with \u2018That\u2019s\nnot all!\u2019 Soon our bowls of corn flakes,\ncroissants and bananas arrived and we\npacked up and headed down to the bus\nfor another day\u2019s racing.\nThe weather had been predominantly dry but a strong wind caused choppy\nwater and bad racing conditions on day\ntwo. Sunday was a big day for the novice women racing in the WN4+ composed of stroke siders Selina Graham\nand Mackenzie Clavin while Anna\nand I took bow side. Having only one\nrace to compete in over the weekend,\nwe had our eyes firmly fixed on gold.\nThere were 47 boats in our category\nand we had to compete in a time trial\nto weed out the deadwood before the\nheats could begin.\nTime trials were occurring all morning for several of the races and Steve\nhad been informed that we could do\nour trial at any time within the allotted\nperiod. Eager to race we headed out in\nfirst only to be told by the marshall at\nthe start line that all men\u2019s boats had to\nrace before a women\u2019s boat could start.\nThis meant sitting for a good forty five\nminutes in the cold as the men\u2019s crews\u2019\npaddled past us. Steve officially slapped\nthe marshall with his gold medal and\nthey consequently apologised for the\nmisinformation.\nDespite the long wait we powered\nthrough the time trial. Our heats were\nspaced throughout the day and we fell\ninto a pattern of eat, race, eat, sleep,\neat, race which proved a successful for-IC Boat Club bring home the bacon at BUSA\nChristina Duffy\nmula. The windy conditions exposed\nthe less-experienced crews unable to\nsteer and maintain their boats in the\ncorrect lanes. Cox Nicola Quinn Pyatt\nstrategically coxed us into position and\nkept our focus in the boat. Our tide-way training stood us in good stead for\nthe rough conditions and we made up\nmost water in these patches. We dominated the first heat with similar results\nfor the semi-final. The final was closer\nbut we edged into the lead from the off\nand maintained this position, breaking\naway from the pack in our final push\nfor home. My first rowing medal\u2026 so\nproud! Weigh-in for lightweights was\nin the afternoon and Clarice was leaving nothing to chance spending much\nof the day wrapped in bin liners, multiple layers of lycra and a woolly hat for\nsweat runs up and down the lakeside.\nOthers lay about the shore skimming\nstones and terrorising local dogs.\nThe MN4+ of John Dick at stroke,\nAdam Mayall, Andy Forester and\nMichael Zammit coxed by Connie also\nclaimed gold in an exciting final race.\nFurther victory ensued for the ML4x of\nBen Newland, Ole Tietz, Andrew Gordon and Oli Mahony defeating Durham by over four seconds. However\nDurham was the thorn in Imperial\u2019s\nside taking gold from silver medallists\nRichard Winchester and Will McFarland in the MJ-2 and Jenny Forrester\nand Erica Thompson in the WC2-.\nDurham again narrowly claimed gold\nover Imperial\u2019s WLC4x entry of Claire\nWaterworth, Rachael Davies, Clarice\nChung and Cynthia Mynhardt by a\nmere 0.59ths of a second. Oli Mahony\ncollected his second medal of the day\ncoming third in the CL1x final.\nThe sun broke out for the final day\u2019s\nracing for Monday and further glory\nwas in store for remaining Imperial\ncrews. Gold medals were awarded to\nErica Thompson in the WN1x category\nand Andrew Gordon and Ole Tietz for\ntheir performance in the ML2x. Silver\nwent to Ben Newland, Richard Winchester, Sam Lindsay and Will McFarland in the MJ4x, whilst bronze medals\nwere taken home by Rachael Davies\nand Claire Waterworth in the WL2x\nand by Jenny Forrester in the WC1x.\nOverall Imperial came third out of\n42 universities with an impressive 573\npoints, behind Durham and Newcastle\nin the Victor Ludurum Trophy. Imperial was only beaten through the sheer\nvolume of entrants by the other com-petitors. ICBC also qualified 4 boats for\nthe European Universities Championships in Zagreb this summer. This was\nan incredible performance by all crews\nand shows the dedication ICBC crews\nand coaches put into training.

    "content": "comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Comment\nA\nll power to the imagina-tion! 1968 and its lega-cies: since April 10, and\nuntil 10 June, London\nhas been celebrating a\n\u2018season\u2019 of cinema, talks, events, visual\nart, literature and music which has\ncommemorated the cultural, political and social protests of that significant year. Forty years later, the season\nstrives to place the lessons of 1968 in\ntoday\u2019s context; how relevant are the\nstruggles and ideals of that swinging\ndecade in the era of iPods, iPhones and\ni-don\u2019t-give-a-shit attitudes. I am betting the majority of \u201cyoung people\u201d will\nnot have the faintest clue what is meant\nby 1968 and they would be forgiven for\ntheir ignorance.\nThe term itself is rather ambiguous\ngiven the plethora of events of every\nnature that occurred in those 366 days\n(for it was a leap year). 1968 has become symbolic with the plight of the\npeople, protests and attempts at revolution which sprung up throughout\nthe world, sweeping the US, France,\nGermany, Czechoslovakia, Mexico\nand Brazil; whilst Britain remained\nalarmingly quiet throughout this time:\nperhaps the hangover from winning\nthe World Cup in 1966 had not yet\nabated?!\n1946 to 1964 saw the birth of the ba-by-boom generation following the war\nyears and so the \u2018youthful population\u2019\nchanged from 11.5% in 1958 to 17.2%\nCaz Knight\nRevolutionaries wanted\nin 1978 causing a huge rise in university students by the late sixties. The\nchange to the university demographic,\nnotably the rise in percentage of women and black students, added fuel to\nthe already fiery climate in campuses\nacross the globe. Equal rights for all,\nfree love, sexual liberation (something\nthis campus should start campaigning\nfor), an end to an unpopular and\nfailing war, changes to the\nhigher education system\nwere things wanted\nby the \u2018soixantehuitards\u2019; many\nthings today\u2019s\nstudents take for\ngranted. Rudi\nDutschke at the\nFrei Universitat\nin Berlin wanted\nwar against capitalism via \u201cupheaval\nin centres of imperialism\u201d. Courses sprung\nup in American universities with names such as \u2018Radical Perspectives on Social Change\u2019 and\ngroups such as the Workers-Student\nAlliance emerged with a very Marxist\nflavour.\nHumanity\u2019s climate was perhaps best\nsummed up in Germaine Greer\u2019s book\nThe Female Eunuch, where she wrore:\n\u201cit may be possible to leap the steps of\nrevolution and arrive somehow at liberty and communism without strategy\nor revolutionary discipline.\u201d This is\nwhat the students wanted. A revolu-tion, but the urge to party and have sex\nwas stronger. The human condition is\none of pleasure seeking and has been\nsince Caligula\u2019s rampant hedonism in\nancient Rome to today\u2019s unruly binge\ndrinkers. (But let us not for a second\nput the two on equal footing!).\nSo why is it that today, and indeed in 1960s Britain, there\nis a lack of revolutionary zeal amongst\nthe youth? Is it the\nBritish condition\nto be more passive than our\nYankee counter-parts? Do previous British \u2018philosophies\u2019 such as\n\u201cmusn\u2019t grumble\u201d\nand \u201cknow your\nstation\u201d infer an attitude of putting up with\nthings, or is it laziness?\nOne of my qualms is when\nBritish people complain about immigrants stealing \u2018their\u2019 jobs: the jobs\nare there, it is up to you to go and get\nthem!\nMaybe this attitude has also hindered a revolution among the people:\nas a nation we (I hesitate in using the\nterm \u2018we\u2019) just cannot be bothered.\nThere certainly is a lot worth fighting for and fighting against. Conserving the planet, for example. Climate\nchange or not, isn\u2019t saving Earth\u2019s\nbeauty just cause enough? I shudder at\nthe thought of a planet in a thousand\nyears with nothing but man-made edi-fices. Another thing I feel very strongly\nabout is the sheer volume of youth violence in this city. Who brought these\nchildren up to harbour such resentment and, dare I say it, evil? Or do they\nhave no responsibility for their actions\nand are simply a product of their envi-ronment? The \u2018Nature Vs. Nurture\u2019 argument goes on. The main administrative building at Harvard was renamed\n\u2018Che Guevara Hall\u2019 in April 1969. He\nwas a revolutionary and is still revered\ntoday.
