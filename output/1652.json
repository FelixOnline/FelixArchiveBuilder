In the grand\nscheme of things it\ndoesn\u2019t matter though,\nnothing does.\nThis week you\u2019re\nThe Queen and you\nweren\u2019t seen in public\nfor two weeks over\nChristmas.

See I\nnormally don\u2019t make any \u2013 I don\u2019t consider myself a sheep,\nmindlessly adopting trends for no good reason. But this year I\nthought I\u2019d give resolving a shot. And boy did I.\nI promised myself I\u2019d workout every day, start eating more\nfibre (that was a request from my colon) and study real hard\nfor my January exams. I said I\u2019d walk my dog twice a day,\nquit porn and do some recreational reading every night\nbefore bed. I could go on for hours but what would be the\npoint? All resolutions have already been BROKEN! Well\nwith the exception of quitting porn, but that\u2019s solely due to a\ngovernment ban on my favourite genres.\nChris help me. How do I make successful resolutions?\nYours,\nAP Nouya\nDear Nouya\nI\u2019m really sorry that 2017 has already sucked\nso hard for you, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t\nsee your complete and utter failure coming. I\nmean you know it\u2019s amateur hour when someone promises they\u2019ll \u201cwork out every day\u201d.\nLesson number one. When making a resolu-tion, be as vague as possible and avoid at all\ncosts to specify time frame and magnitude. I\nsaid I\u2019d work out in 2017. On January 2nd\nI did\na push up. Boom. Success.\nBut you don\u2019t even need to try to keep your\nresolutions if you\u2019re tactical. For example, this\nyear I promised myself I\u2019d get sick less! But I\ndon\u2019t really have an option because I can\u2019t\nHOROSCOPES\nafford private healthcare and the NHS is in\nshambles! So it\u2019s either that or probably death\nin a corridor in a Worcestershire Hospital.\nFinally, for a 100% success rate just keep your\nresolutions to yourself. Because no one can\ncall you out on the mess you call a life if they\ndon\u2019t know you tried to change. And let\u2019s be\nhonest, no one wants to know your lame-ass\nresolutions unless it\u2019s something like achieving\nworld peace or cloning Hitler.\nHope that helps!\nBig luv,\nChris xxxx\n\n"

    "content": "felix\nC U L T U R E\nFriday 13 January 2017 13\nfelix.culture@ic.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk/culture\nI\nt turns out Ryan Gosling\nis as roguishly charming\nand wonderful in person\nas we all hoped he would\nbe. I was lucky enough\nto see La La Land for\nthe first time at a London\nFilm Festival screening,\nafter which he appeared to\na hurricane of cheers and\nthrown roses/knickers for a\nQ&A. When asked about\ndance number, and several\nextended analyses of the\njoys of jazz, for Christ\u2019s sake,\nreleasing a movie like this\nin 2016 certainly must have\ntaken some guts \u2013 or, rather\nmore likely, a hell of a lot of\nheart.\nIt tells the story of Mia\n(Emma Stone), Sebastian\n(Gosling) and \u2013 well, actu-ally, nobody else. Minor\nplayers from the two Los\nAngeles-based dreamers\u2019\nseparate lives may flicker into\nappearance for a brief spell,\nbut La La Land is very much\nThe Stone & Gosling Show.\nThank god then, that what we\nhave here is a pair of the best\nperformances either of these\nactors have ever given, and\nthat their chemistry has never\nbeen stronger than it is in this\nfilm \u2013 it appears their crush-ingly lifeless work in 2013\u2019s\nGangster Squad was only a\nfluke. When they are working\nin tandem, whether in conver-sation, song, or movement,\nthey click so tightly that you\nwonder if you\u2019re watching\ntwo real humans or two\nbeautiful clockwork con-traptions. They\u2019re strikingly\nreminiscent of some of the\ngreat old-time silver screen\ncouples like Ginger Rogers\n& Fred Astaire. And yet they\nexcel individually too: Ryan\nGosling brings every Ryan\nGosling-ism in the book to his\nperformance, and yet you\nalways believe that the man\nyou are watching is indeed\njazz enthusiast Seb Wilder\nwhen a song is not necessary,\nit does not appear; some of\nthe story\u2019s most crucial points\ntake place in a spoken scene,\nnot in song, but are certainly\nno less powerful for it. There\nis a scene in which a quiet\ndinner descends into an argument which, as well as being\na frontrunner for the film\u2019s\nbest moment, is in all honesty\none of the best-written and\nbest-acted scenes I have ever\nwatched in a musical, onstage\nor onscreen; Chazelle proves\nthat he has not let his razor-sharp skill for dialogue that\nhe displayed in Whiplash be\nblunted by the grander aims\nof this project.\nThe immense, upbeat dance\nnumber that opens the film\nis something of a fake-out;\nwhile I suppose it\u2019s very\nmuch necessary to prepare\nthe audience for the fact that\nwhat they\u2019re about to watch is\na musical, the film that follows\nis so much more layered and\nintelligent than you expect\nfollowing such a full-throttled\nshow-tune (the song\u2019s lyrics\nperfectly fit the themes of the\nfilm, but we only learn that\nafter we have seen it play\nout). La La Land is not just\nfor lovers of musicals, but for\nlovers of movies. It tackles\nwith elegance, eloquence,\nand bold honesty the act of\nchasing a dream, whether\nthat dream be acting or\nopening a jazz club, and the\nsacrifices that must be made\nto achieve it. After watching it, I left the theatre both\nheartbroken and blissfully\nhappy. Chazelle reportedly\nsays that it took six years of\npeople saying \u201cno\u201d to him to\nget La La Land into produc-tion. Seeing the completed\nversion of his film, the fruit of\nhis perseverance, must have\nbeen worth every second of\nthe wait.\nTom Stephens\nThe highly aticipated modern day\nmusical which draws inspiration\nfrom the old classics is as amazing\nas the hype has made it out to be.\n(not least thanks to a strong\ngrasp of jazz piano stylings\nand a startling baritone-bass\nsinging voice, both of which\nhe appears to have pulled\nout of thin air). But of the two\nstars, Stone shines the bright-est. As we watch her struggle\nthrough failed audition after\nfailed audition, and make\ncoffee after coffee just to get\nby, her every action, every\nfacial expression, every note\ncarried by her beautiful earnest voice is an utter charm to\nbehold, and she is deserving\nof every award that will\nundoubtedly be flung her way\nthis year.\nWhile Stone and Gosling\nprove proficient as musical\ntheatre performers, their\nstrength as actors is what is\nrelied on most in La La Land.\nThis feels very much inten-tional. One of the strongest\naspects of this film is that\ndirector Chazelle understands\nwhat made classic Hollywood\nmusicals so great; not an\nendless barraged of forced\nshow-tunes (there are only 7\npieces that are sung by the\ncast in the film, and one of\nthem is a reprise), but perfect-ly-timed transitions into that\nheightened version of reality\nthat only a musical can con-jure, signifying those moments\nin which, as Chazelle put\nit, \u201ceverything just comes\ntogether\u201d. These are moments\nlike a playfully flirty conversation on a hilltop overlooking\nHollywood that becomes a\ntap-danced duet, a poignant\n\\\\ Dale Robinette/AP\nLa La Land\nthe challenges he had faced\nsinging and dancing for the\nfilm, he cracked that the real\nchallenge was having his\ndirector Damien Chazelle\nconstantly walking around\nthe set in baggy old-timey\ngangster trousers, clown\nshoes, and an oversized\nmonocle that he insisted\non wearing. What. A.\nDreamboat.\nAt the same Q&A, Chazelle (who also wrote the\nfilm) recounted the time he\nmentioned to his producer\n\u2013 before beginning the\nprocess of making his 2014\nfeature Whiplash \u2013 that he\nhad always had the dream\nof filming a love letter to the\ngolden years of Hollywood\nin the form of an original\nromantic musical. It\u2019s not hard\nto believe that a vivid expression of alarm came over\nthe producer\u2019s face, or that\nthe reply Chazelle received\nwas \u201cthat\u2019s just about every\ntaboo word you can say to a\nproducer\u201d; you can tell when\nyou watch La La Land that it\u2019s\na miracle you\u2019re watching it\nat all. With lengthily played-out fantasy sequences, a tap\n\\\\ It tackles\nwith elegance,\neloquence, and bold\nhonesty the act of\nchasing a dream \\\\\n\\\\ Chazelle\nunderstands what\nmade classic\nHollywood musicals\nso great \\\\\nreflection on a new-found\nlove set to the beautiful yet\ntantalisingly short tune City of\nStars (perhaps the film\u2019s best\nnumber), and the same tune\u2019s\nreprise which is reworked\ninto a duet capturing Mia\nand Seb\u2019s relationship at its\nmost serene and intimate.

And I can see\nwhere he\u2019s coming from. We\u2019re all\nin our mid-twenties and we seem\nto permanently be at a crossroads. Transcending\nfrom adolescence into adulthood (it\u2019s\u2026 a process) \u2013\nchanging, adapting, compromising.\nThe other day I had a moment. I was sat in my living\nroom, going over 2017 with my housemate Clive when\nI brought up climate change. I started talking about\nthis thing I\u2019d read in the news, the Larson C ice shelf.\nA 5,000 sq km wide, 300 m thick piece of ice getting\nready to break off from Antarctica and become an\niceberg; an event that might raise global sea levels by\nten centimetres.\n\u201cShit man, it\u2019s happening\u201d said Clive. To which I\nnonchalantly spat back something along the lines of:\n\u201cI don\u2019t even care anymore. We\u2019ll be dead by the time\nthis planet becomes inhospitable\u201d\nThere was a pause and I added: \u201cI can\u2019t believe I just\nsaid that\u201d.\nI was gonna clean up the plastic from our oceans.\nHolly would find a cure for cancer, Theo would\ncreate a new anarcho-cryptocurrency, Mischa would\neradicate malaria and Josh would become a rockstar.\nBut now we\u2019re all sat around a table, eating our\ngourmet burgers, with sides of whatever the latest\nvegetable trend is and we talk about how the world is\nfucked. How we all feel the flight rather than the fight\ninstinct kicking in.\nAnd maybe it\u2019s understandable to feel this way right\nnow. The past year has been one bitch of a year.\nAnd maybe you\u2019re muttering \u201cWake up hun \u2013 you\u2019re\nnot a unique snowflake. You can\u2019t change the world\u201d.\nBut fuck that. Cause the world doesn\u2019t need me to\nchange. The world changes regardless of what I will\nor will not think and do. Just look at 2016.\nYes, there was a lot of death and destruction. But if\nyou look up, you\u2019ll see a second moon now orbiting\nthe Earth, a newly discovered prime number, and\ngravitational waves. You\u2019ll see that tiger numbers\nrose for the first time in over a century. You\u2019ll see that\nAustria didn\u2019t allow rightwing populism to take hold\nquite yet.\nSo what if we\u2019re not unique snowflakes capable\nof changing the world? Some will be lucky and\ndetermined enough to do so.

It wouldn\u2019t be\nuntil the end of the year that\nthe dankness would finally\nreturn.\nWhat started as a simple\nmeme page in Cambridge\n(Memebridge) has quickly\nexploded into a national\necosystem of university meme\npages each with thousands of\nfollowers. University memes\nare by no means a new\nphenomenon (the original\nImperial Memes page has\nnearly 5000 likes) but this\nnew crop of pages has\nsucceeded in a different way,\nthriving on interuniversity\nrivalry and collaboration.\nThis rivalry was the catalyst\nfor the growth of the university meme scene. Soon after\nMemebridge was created\na group of Oxford students\nstarted their own page,\nOxmeme. The long-term\nsuccess of memes has always\ncome down to the way in\nwhich they are reused and\nreplicated. So naturally it\nwasn\u2019t long before Oxmeme\ndecided to steal Memebridge\u2019s memes, a deadly sin\nin the online community. The\nwar had begun.\nAs if one page wasn\u2019t\nenough, a second page was\nborn from the English-speaking world\u2019s oldest university:\nThe Memeing Spires of\nOxford. As more and more\nrival pages appeared, the\nvariety of Memebridge\u2019s\nmemes grew. Durhameme\nproved the perfect target with\ntheir attempt at introducing\n\u201cDoxbridge\u201d to the national\nlexicon, resulting in a number\nof humiliating \u2018roasts.\u2019 Thousands were liking and tagging\ntheir friends in the varsity\nmeme wars but nothing had\nprepared them for what\nwould come next.\nOn the 14th\nof December,\nMemebridge (\u201cSent by\nAlfred\u201d) shared a video\nwhich would shake the\nuniversity meme world to its\ncore. Poking fun at Memeing\nSpires, Oxmeme and Durhameme, \u201cthe bane video\u201d\nset the bar for what a meme\npage could do and is essential viewing for any university\nmeme connoisseur.\nIn the same week, a whole\nnew frontier of the university\nthe\nLikes\nUCL is no where to be seen \\\\ Cale Tilford\nThat can only meme one thing \\\\ Sent by James\nmeme conflict emerged. At\nleast half a dozen new pages\nwere created: Memechester, Birmemeham, Memes\nCollege London (King\u2019s),\nExememe, Royal Memeoway,\nand of course, our favourite,\nMemeperial. While each of\nthese pages has their own\nset of admins and running\njokes, they all share a dislike\nof Oxmeme for no particular\nreason.\nMemeperial currently has\nover 4000 likes, nearly 300\nmore than felix\u2019s own Facebook page, and it\u2019s gained\nthat in a much shorter time.\nWriting for Cambridge\u2019s\nVarsity, Elizabeth Howcroft\ndiscussed whether Memebridge had become the new\nstudent voice of Cambridge,\na place where students\ncould freely share their\nfeelings of existential dread\nthat reappear during every\nexam period. Memeperial is\nsimilar to other pages in that\nit focuses on what makes life\nat Imperial bad; the dreaded\n\u2018Imperial ratio\u2019 is one of many\nrecurring themes. The page\nis good at poking fun of the\nmore trivial things that make\nour life at Imperial miserable\nand maybe that\u2019s enough\nto qualify as the voice of\nImperial students. felix, which\nso many of us hold in high\nesteem, could certainly do\nmore to make students feel\nlike they are part of a community of students who share\nthe same struggles. Despite\nMemeperial\u2019s success, it is\nunlikely to sustain itself in the\nlong-term. You only have to\nlook at Imperial Memes and\nImperial College Secrets, two\npages which now lie dormant,\nto see that meme pages can\nbe short lived. We can only\nhope that Memeperial and\nthe rest of the new pages on\nthe meme scene don\u2019t suffer\nthe same fate.\n\\\\ Memeperial\ncurrently has\nover 4000 likes,\nnearly 300 more\nthan felix\u2019s own\nFacebook page \\\\\n\\\\ It wasn\u2019t long\nbefore Oxmeme\ndecided to steal\nMemebridge\u2019s\nmemes \\\\\n\\\\ The page is good\nat poking fun of the\nmore trivial things\nthat make our life\nat Imperial\nmiserable \\\\\nmeme\nWars\nA\ns a year,\n2016 really\npissed me off.\nI remember\nwhen 2008\nended. I\nremember people saying\nthat it would be consigned\nto history as the year of the\nGreat Recession. My call is\nthat 2016 will be seen as the\nyear of the fuck-up. The future\nlooks uncertain and shaky.\nNo one planned for political\ntragedy and who knows\nwhen deaths of refugees on\nthe Mediterranean, of Syrians\nin their homes and terrorist\nbombings will end. Last year\nthe world saw a profound\nchange.\nThis was accompanied\nby a generational shift\nthat has seen the concept\nof the Millennial placed\ncentre stage. But do most\nof us fully grasp what\nthis involves? I don\u2019t think\nso, so I\u2019m going to make\na stab at describing the\nfundamental differences\nbetween the lives of a\n60\u2019s kid and a 90\u2019s kid.\nWhy is this important?\n2017 needs to be spent\nfixing this bloody mess,\nand if we make use of\nthe character traits that\nset us apart from past\ngenerations, we can get\nsomewhere better. Also,\nwe need to understand the\nbroader picture of societal\nchange. Answering the\nquestion \u2018What makes\nyoung people in general\npro-EU?\u2019 is important in\nunderstanding how to\nclean up the turd 2016 left\nbehind on the living room\nfloor.\nWe need to acknowledge the fact that our\nlife attitude, drive and\naims are distinctly different from those of our\nparents. Many of us were\nbrought up in an environment where we were\ntold that we could do\nwhatever we wanted with\nour lives, where avenues\nof opportunity opened\nup to us. How different\nthat is from my Italian\ngrandparents, who stayed\nnear the villages they\nwere born in, used to visit\nthe same beach nearly\nevery Summer on holiday.\nNowadays, we are taught\nto take advantage of our\nindividual freedom in such\na way that all of these\nthings become a personal\nchoice. The world is your\noyster, and you can travel\nand find jobs wherever\nyou fancy. Also, you are\nnot compelled to stick\nwith the religion of your\nheritage.\nYoung Millennials\nwill therefore make life\nchoices in a new way,\nmotivated by a different\ncombination of factors\nthan their predecessors.\nIn 2010, Pew Research\nCentre found that of eights\nchoices presented to US\n18-29 year-olds, the third\nmost important priority\nin their lives was to help\nothers in need. Having a\nhigh-paying career only\ncame sixth. So there does\nappear to be a consensus that young people\nstrive towards a life with\npurpose, in which self-ful-filment is achieved by\nmaking a positive impact\nrather than by pecuniary\nreward.\nIn my opinion, the\ngrowth of secularism in\nsociety has forced us to\nreassess our place in the\nuniverse. Faith prescribes\nmeaning to people\u2019s lives.\nIt tells you how to be good\nin the eyes of something\nhigher. Without it, we\nmust decide our role in the\nworld for ourselves. There\nis less emphasis in our\nlives in working towards\npleasing God and more on\nliving either for ourselves\nor for the good of our\ncommunity, whether it is\nlocal or global.\nThe job market has\nresponded to our changing view of the world.\nMany of our parents will\nhave worked for the same\ncompany for as many as\n40 years. When they were\napplying for jobs, it was\nseen as risky to employ\nsomeone who had done\nmany different things for\nshort amounts of time\nbecause they were more\nlikely to leave and move\nelsewhere. Now we care\nless for the stability of a\nlong-term job. It is now\nnormal to spend several\nyears in different jobs,\nthen leave to follow a pas-sion. The modern thinking\nsees this favourably since\nyou have accumulated\na variety of experience\nand have seen things from\nmore than one perspec-tive. In fact, it is harder\nto gain a promotion\nwithin your own company\nbecause recruiters will\nsearch outside for the best\ntalent, and it becomes\nmore appealing to go elsewhere to work.\nIt is apparent that we\nsee our own personal\ndevelopment as more valuable than loyalty to an\norganisation. This gives us\nthe drive to do something\nthat can selflessly take the\nworld forward \u2013 perhaps\ncontributing to renewable\nenergies or organisational\ntransparency. As nations\nhave become more pros-perous, new technologies,\nin particular the internet,\nhave been developed\nand put at the disposal of\nMillennials who want to\ndo great things with them.\nHowever, there are times\nwhen personal gain is pri-oritised above the greater\ngood, as can be seen\nby Buzzfeed\u2019s reports of\nteenagers from the Former\nYugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia making money\nby creating fake news\nsupporting Trump.\nMy hope is that our lot\nwill one day repair the\nmess left by the year of\nthe fuck-up. This cohort\nis more well-educated,\ntolerant and open to different perspectives \u2013 even\nthough Brexit might seem\nlike a vote for change,\nit was actually led by\nnostalgia and a resistance\nto modernity. As we grow\nolder and Millennials\nbecome more dominant, I\nsee a future where post-truth politics will wilt.\nTheMillennialsareallthatcansaveusin\nthispost-truthworld\nWe can do anything we want, and that\u2019s not usually helping people for the greater good\nGiacomo Boscaini-Gilroy\n\\\\ I hope that as\nwe come of age, a\ncohort more well-educated than ever\nwill force post-truth\npolitics to wilt \\\\\n\\\\ I\u2019m going to\nmake a stab at\ndescribin g the\nfundamental\ndifferences\nbetween the lives\nof a 60s kid and a\n90s kid \\\\\n\n"

Following\na successful career orientated woman who after being\nraped begins to suspect all the men in her life, who both\nadore and resent her. Isabelle Huppert praised for her\nrole, being called \u2018the best living actor\u2019, plays a woman\nwho refuses to be the victim and instead uses her situation\nto her advantage. Elle explores the mindset of a modern\nindependent woman and those that surround her \u2013 is\nshe someone to be hated and pitied, or someone to be\nfeared?\nFollowing his late breakout film Beginners, a semi-auto-biographical film that dealt with his father coming out as\ngay in his mid-70s, Mike Mills returns for his long-awaited\nfollow-up, 20th\nCentury Women. Again, Mills turns to his\nown life for inspiration, looking towards the strength of\nhis mother and sisters when he was growing up. The film\ncentres on Jamie (Lucas Jade Zimmerman), who is being\nraised in 1970s California by single-mother Dorothea\n(Annette Bening). Dorothea seeks out the help of Abbie\n(Greta Gerwig), a young punk, and Julie (Elle Fanning),\none of Jamie\u2019s peers, to help raise him right. 20th\nCentury\nWomen bills itself as \u2018a collective portrait of the women\nwho became our mothers,\u2019 and while some might balk at\nsuch an epithet, Mills manages to remain on the right side\nof sentimentality.\n\\\\SBS Production\n\\\\ Film Society of Lincoln Center\nBy Fred Fyles\n& Meryl Anil\nknow their top films to look out for\nT2 Trainspotting \u2013 Released 27th January\nChristine \u2013 Released 27th January\nIf you\u2019ve seen Danny Boyle\u2019s masterpiece Trainspotting\n(1996), this is a no-brainer. If you haven\u2019t then go watch\nit. Trainspotting (1996) followed the lives of Mark (Ewan\nMcGregor) and his circle of drug addicts amidst the urban\npoverty in Edinburgh. It showcased the life, culture and\nthe morals of the people living in that subculture. A highly\nstylised film receiving widespread critical acclaim, it could\nbe said it was this film that catapulted Danny Boyle into\nthe main circles. T2 Trainspotting is the sequel to that sen-sation. T2 follows Mark and his gang 20 years down the\nline from the 1996 classic. After being left with promises\nof living a \u2018stable, traditional life\u2019 from the former heroin\naddict, the film is a ticking time bomb and it explodes later\nthis January.\nChristine tells the harrowing story of Christine Chubbuck,\na Florida news anchor who killed herself live on air in\n1974. Rebecca Hall takes on the titular character in a powerhouse performance that mines the depths of Chubbuck\u2019s\nself-destructive tendencies; due to its release date, Christine missed out on eligibility for BAFTAs, but I\u2019m hoping\nthat Hall\u2019s performance is recognised by the American\nAcademy come Oscars season. Watching her Chubbuck is\nlike watching a volcano that\u2019s about to erupt, with all the\nfeelings bubbling beneath the surface. Director Antonio\nCampos perfectly creates the environs of sunny Florida,\nwhich contrasts with Chubbuck\u2019s increasing downward\nspiral; he handles the sensitive material delicately, without\never tipping over into exploitation. Christine is a profound,\nsensitive exploration of the depths some people are driven\nto by their mental health problems, painting a picture that\nis fair and just, but never shies away from darker issues.\n\\\\ Cloud Eight Films\nSpring term picks | felix\u2019s film editors let you\n\\\\ Sundance\nSilence\nF\nollowing on from\nthe messy hedonism\nof The Wolf of Wall\nStreet \u2013 a three\nhour orgy of casual\nviolence, over-sexualisation, and easy\nprofanity \u2013 it is clear that\nMartin Scorsese is searching\nfor a kind of \u2018mea culpa\u2019 with\nSilence, a mix of asceticism,\nendurance, and proselytism.\nIt\u2019s a hard pill to swallow.\nBased on a Shusaku Endo\nnovel, Silence follows the\nplight of two Portuguese\npriests \u2013 Father Rodrigues\n(Andrew Garfield) and\nFather Garupe (a little-used\nAdam Driver) \u2013 who journey\nto Japan in search of their\nmentor, Father Ferreira (Liam\nNeeson).\nFerreira, as we learn at\nthe beginning of the film,\nwas made to endure brutal\ntortures at the hands of the\nJapanese, and has since (it is\nrumoured) renounced God.\nHe performs this apostasy \u2013 a\nword that recurs throughout\nthe film \u2013 by stepping on a\nsmall image of Jesus; it\u2019s a\nminiscule but meaningful act,\nand the Japanese converts\nwho refuse to do so are put to\ndeath.\nGarupe and Rodrigues are\naccompanied to Japan by\nKichijiro (Yosuke Kubozuka\n\u2013 a highlight of the film), who\nhas already suffered physical\nand psychological torture at\nthe hands of the government.\nWhat follows is a three-hour\nslog through the mountain\nvillages of Western Japan,\nwhich progresses at such a\nslow pace, it\u2019s like wading\nthrough a biblical flood of\ntreacle. This isn\u2019t helped by\nthe bizarre decision to get\nDriver and Garfield to put on\nunplaceable, quasi-European\naccents, which veer all over\nthe place, and make their\nacting seem strained. For\nDriver, the accent he puts on\nis like a thick lacquer that is\nnevertheless unable to hide\nthe inflections of his idiosyncratic voice. For Garfield,\nmeanwhile, the accent is more\nsure, but still off-putting, and\nnot helped by the constant\nvoiceovers he provides \u2013 for\na film called Silence, there\nsure is a lot of unnecessary\ntalking going on.\nThe film is at its most\ndynamic towards the last\nhour, when Rodrigues Fred Fyles\n(Garupe has since left the\nscene) encounters his sparring partner, the Inquisitor\n(played brilliantly by Issey\nOgata), and they debate on\nthe reasons for the Christian\nmission to Japan. It is in these\nlucid, enlightening moments,\nshot through with literary\nimagery \u2013 Japan is a swamp,\nthe potential colonisers are\nforeign, intrusive concubines\n\u2013 that the near-monologue\nGarfield is forced to recite is\nrevealed for what it truly is: a\ncollection of religious-sound-ing platitudes, that ultimately\nbelie any real meaning.\nThroughout Silence,\nScorsese documents with\nincreasing brutality the torture used against Christians:\nfrom slowly dribbling scalding\nwater down their bare torsos,\nto hanging them upside-down, a slit in their neck\nbleeding them drop by drop.\nIt seems Scorsese wished to\ninflict similar violences on\nhis audience: Silence is an\nover-wrought, un-nuanced\nwork of film, which more than\nwears out its welcome. Pure\n(cinematic) torture.\nA strained, off-putting work \\\\ Paramount\nS\ntorytellers are\na threat,\u201d wrote\nChinua Achebe,\n\u201cthey threaten\nall champions of\ncontrol, usurpers\nof the right-to-freedom of\nthe human spirit\u201d. It is this\npower, that of a simple story\nwell-told, that director J. A.\nBayona is trying to tap with\nhis latest feature A Monster\nCalls, an adaptation of\nPatrick Ness\u2019 fantasy novel.\nBut the simplest of stories are\nthe ones the most difficult\nto tell, and unfortunately \u2013\ndespite a strong cast and\nproficient visuals \u2013 A Monster\nCalls fails to deliver.\nThe film centres around\nConor O\u2019Malley (Lewis\nMacDougall), a bullied\nschoolboy whose mother\n(Felicity Jones) is dying of\nterminal cancer. During her\ndeterioration, Conor needs to\ndeal with both his estranged\nfather (Toby Kebbell), and\nhis domineering grandmother\n(Sigourney Weaver). Luckily,\nhe has the help of a giant\ntree-monster, voiced with\ngravelly gravitas by Liam\nNeeson, who tells Conor\nstories that are more twisted\nand knotty than those in a\ntraditional story-book. The\nMonster creates a visually\nstunning world \u2013 aided by\nthe art team behind Pan\u2019s\nLabyrinth \u2013 where princes are\nnot always good, and wicked\ngrandmothers can be acting\nwith pure intentions.\nHowever, unlike Pan\u2019s\nLabyrinth, which was unafraid\nof handling mature topics\nwith grace, A Monster Calls\nby and large avoids tackling\nthe more difficult themes\nthat are so sorely needed\nin coming-of-age films. A\nparent with cancer might\nseem like a grown-up enough\nproposition, but there is never\nany sense of menace or\ndanger in the film, making it\nseem emotionally blunted. A\nMonster Calls plays the same\nsentimental note throughout,\nat times teetering over into\nmawkishness.\nA Monster Calls is also\nmarked by a number of incongruities in its reference points\nand unevenness in tone.\nWith its perennial gloomy\nweather and suburban\ndrear, Bayona is trying to hit\nthematic targets that range\nfrom British coming-of-age Fred Fyles\nStorytelling without bite \\\\ YouTube/Focus Features\nflicks to kitchen-sink drama,\nbut it adds up to an uncanny\nenvironment. Compared\nto the intricate pop-culture\nlayers contained in, say, the\nDuffer Brothers\u2019 Stranger\nThings, A Monster Calls is\nconstantly missing the mark\nin its portrayal of suburban\nEnglish youth in revolt.\nThere are stand-out parts of\nthe film: Sigourney Weaver is\nbrilliant as the brittle, distant\ngrandmother, trying desperately to contain the pain of\na parent watching their child\ndie before their eyes; and\nLewis MacDougall is certainly\none to watch out for \u2013 his\nConor is able to ricochet\neffortlessly and naturally\nfrom happiness to despair\nto rage. The watercolour\nsequences \u2013 which appear\ntoo infrequently \u2013 mine a rich\nheritage of British cultural ico-nography, and are gorgeous\nindications of what the film\ncould have been. Ultimately,\nwhile A Monster Calls may\ncontain an emotional punch,\nit misses its mark too often,\nleaving us with only a sense\nof missed opportunity.\nA Monster\nCalls\n\n"

I was so\nhungry by then, I grabbed\nmy dripping wet knife and\nfork off the damp napkin and\ndug in. Yes, I paid the extra\n\u00a32 for the non-existent black\ntruffle (the black specks were\njust burnt carbon bits), but\nthe scrambled eggs were the\nbest I\u2019ve ever had. Creamy,\nvelvety-smooth yet light \u2013 the\ncheap, spongy white bread\nsoaking up the golden river of\ndeliciousness. I washed down\neach and every mouthful with\nmilk tea \u2013 smooth and just the\nright amount of gip (a Cantonese word for bitterness).\nAs I headed towards the\nforever pissed-off-looking\nlady at the till by the door, my\nP\nlonk.\nIt was the sound\nof a quarter-inch\nthick china cup\nhitting the glass-topped wooden\ntable, as my milk tea lands\nbefore me just three seconds\nafter the waiter took my\norder.\nMy mind snapped out from\nmy fuzzy morning daydream\nof fluffy bunnies jumping\nover lush green grass back\ninto full awareness of the\nreality. It was brunch time on\na muggy Tuesday morning,\nbut with a slight change of\nscene from the usual relaxed\ncafes in Shoreditch \u2013 I was\nsitting alone, next to strangers\nin a small, cramped room\nlit by bright, yellow lights.\nAn oversized, gold piece\nof calligraphy, a gift from\na celebrity, was proudly\ndisplayed on one retro-look-ing, black-and-white tiled\nwall. Customers slurped their\nnoodles, gulped down their\ntea, occasionally glancing up\nfrom their phones. Two waiters rushed around the tables,\nwiping down the tables after\neach customer, replacing\nthe used cutlery with freshly\nwashed ones, shouting\norders to the sweating chefs\nin the open kitchen behind,\ndumping plates of breakfast\nfood on tables and chatting in\nfull-blown Cantonese. I was in\nCapital Caf\u00e9, a local caf\u00e9 on\na busy street in Hong Kong.\nTo be more specific, this\ncaf\u00e9 is a typical Cha-ChaanTeng \u2013 a Hong Kong-style\ncaf\u00e9. With that said, you\ncan now ditch the stereotypical ideas of what a \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019\nshould be. Here, there is no\noverpriced coffee served in\nbranded paper cups. Here,\nthere is no good-looking\nbaristas with suspected\ndyslexia. Here, there is no\nfree Wi-Fi and no comfortable sofas with music blasting\nin the background. A ChaChaan-Teng is the place to\nfill your stomach with quick,\naffordable, truly Hong Kongese food. It is the place you\u2019d\ngo to when you finish work\nlate at night, for an early\nmorning breakfast or an\nafternoon tea at 15:15. It is\nthe place where you eat surrounded by noise, and expect\nto be kicked out as soon as\nyou\u2019ve finished your meal. It is\nthe place where you witness a\nfood culture that has formed\nthrough many years under\nBritish rule, a tradition that\nhas survived through many\ngenerations, a well-loved\ncuisine that answers the true\nneeds, tastes and lifestyle of\nworking class Hong Kong-ese\npeople.\nLet\u2019s be frank. As a Hong\nKong-ese raised by (slightly)\nof laminated sheets of paper\ntucked underneath the glass\ntable-tops, was no excep-tion. Breakfast: macaroni\nin soup with artificial ham,\ntoast with peanut butter and\ncondensed milk. No dim sum,\nby the way. Lunch: spam\nsandwich, spaghetti with\nbarbeque pork. Afternoon\ntea: Deep fried French toast\n(a must-have Hong Kong-ese\nclassic) drenched in golden\nsyrup topped with a big\nslab of butter, finished off\nwith a good cup of milk tea\n(extra-strong black tea with\nevaporated milk, an all-time\nfavourite). No one cares\nabout five-a-day, arteries or\nheart disease when you can\nget a filling meal for under 40\nHKD (\u00a34).\nPlonk.\nThe black truffle scrambled\neggs on toast on a flowery\nplate was dumped in front of\nme just like the others. This\nwas what I came here for \u2013\nan old-school caf\u00e9 keeping\nup with the latest black-truf-fle-in-everything trend. The\nmountain of bright yellow\nscrambled eggs wobbled\nand shook on the inch-thick\npiece of white toast, with\nChristy Lam\nhealth-conscious parents,\nI\u2019ve ever only entered a\nCha-Chaan-Teng three times\nin 21 years. Why? Because\nthe menu would be shock\nhorror to any nutritionist.\nFruit and vegetables do not\nmake an appearance, except\nfor a slice of tomato or a\ncabbage leaf in a sandwich.\nThe menu here, in the form\nmind came clear of a truth. I\nneedn\u2019t the best sourdough,\nfancy French butter with a\nClarence Court egg; it was\nthe cheap bread, the most\nhorrible service you could\never imagine in a rowdy\nenvironment for a taste of\nthe authentic, delicious local\nbreakfast, and reunited my\ntaste buds with my roots.\n\\\\ A well-loved\ncuisine that answers\nthe true needs,\ntastes and lifestyle of\nworking class Hong\nKong-ese people \\\\\n\\\\ Here, there is no\noverpriced coffee\nserved in branded\npaper cups.

Can you feel\nthe enthusiasm? I\ncan feel it all around\ncampus \u2013 especially\nin the library late at night or\nwhen I see some girl crying\nin the bathroom; I\u2019m not\nsaying that men do not cry in\nthe bathroom, but I for one\ncannot see them \u2013 the perks\nof using the \u2018ladies room\u2019.\nBut enough about\ndepressing subjects! Or\nhappy ones assuming\nyou\u2019ve been waiting for\nthis time of year to show\neveryone just how smart\nyou are (Good for you). As\nyou might know by now,\nthis is a food article and,\nhence, I am going to talk\nabout food (duh!). Mostly\nabout easy to make recipes\nthat will allow you to spend\na lot of time revising \u2013 and\nwe all know that by this I\nmean learning stuff for the\nfirst time.\nFrench cuisine at its finest\nPancakes! Maybe not\nthe healthiest food in the\nworld or the easiest to\ncook, but they give me the\nboost of happiness I need\nto continue my day; especially if they are Nutella\nand banana pancakes. Just\ndon\u2019t think about American pancakes. Here we\u2019ll\ntalk about the French kind\n\u2013 crepes.\nBeat the eggs in a bowl,\nbig enough to be able to\nhold all the ingredients.\nAdd the sugar and a touch\nof salt. If you feel like\nexperimenting, get rid of\nthe sugar and add a bit\nopposite might happen and\nthe pancakes might be too\nrunny. In this case, they will\ntake forever to cook \u2013 you\nmight not even be able to\nflip them. If this is the case,\njust add a bit more flour.\nThe final step has come,\nnow that you have the\nperfect batter. Just pour\nsome of the mixture in a\npreheated pan with a bit of\noil in it if you\u2019re not using a\nnon-stick pan. You can try\nand flip them in the air \u2013 I\nmean, what loss is a crepe\nor two!\nWhen you are done,\nstuff them with anything\nyou want. You might try\nmy favourite combination\n\u2013 and by my I mean, everyone\u2019s favourite combination\n\u2013 of Nutella, banana,\nstrawberries and cream.\nWhen I am really desperate for some sugar I even\nadd some maple syrup.\n(Yes, you can judge me and\nyes, probably I\u2019ll discover\nthat I have diabetes in a\ncouple of years). Or you\ncan just come up with your\nown combination.\nCongratulations, you are\na French chef now that you\nknow how to make crepes!\nHealthy mind in a healthy\nbody \u2013 keep lying to\nyourself!\nThis is just a simple salad,\nfor those of you who just\nwant to feel healthy from\ntime to time... Or all the\ntime. It will work if you are\non a diet, too \u2013 but really\nnow, who can be dieting\nand revising at the same\ntime? For me, this is the\nbest 15 minute recipe that\ncan work for either lunch or\ndinner or both, depending\non how much I make.\nI really believe that you\nhave enough imagination\nto know what to do with all\nthese ingredients in order\nto get a salad \u2013 unless you\nhave a howtobasic Youtube\nchannel and you think you\ncan eat the same things you\nupload. If this is indeed the\nmore salt. This way, you\nwill bring out the contrasting flavours, assuming\ntheir pairing with excessive\namounts of Nutella. Just be\ncareful not to add too much\n\u2013 the seasoning of food is\nan art I cannot teach you;\nyou must learn it yourself\nthrough trial and error.\nTo the mixture, add half\nof the milk and stir until\nit becomes homogenous.\nSlowly, start adding the\nflour and continue stirring.\nAdd the rest of the milk\nuntil you get a smooth\nmixture, liquid enough to\nbe able to pour it easily.\nDepending on the flour\nyou\u2019ve picked, you might\nneed to add some more\nmilk. If you are not sure\nabout this, just try cooking\na small pancake and taste\nit; you will know if it feels\nright or not \u2013 hopefully,\nit will! Be aware that the\ncase, you definitely need\nmy guidance. Or anyone\u2019s\nguidenace for that matter.\nHard-boil the eggs (8-10\nminutes). While they are\nboiling, cut the chicken\nbreast in stripes (or cubes,\nor spheres or amino acids\n\u2013 maybe this way you\u2019ll\nfinally remember them) and\nfry it in a preheated pan \u2013\nif it\u2019s a non-stick pan, don\u2019t\nforget to add a tiny bit of\noil.\nCut the tomatoes and the\ncucumber. Chop the spring\nonion(s). You might also\nwant to chop your salad\nleaves if they are of the\nlarge variety. Add them in\na bowl with the corn. Add\nthe fried chicken breast.\nPeel the eggs and cut\nthem into bite-size pieces.\nCut the cheese in 2x2x2 cm\ncubes (if they are 2.01 cm,\nyou\u2019ve ruined the whole\nthing).\nAdd everything to the\nbowl. Mix a bit \u2013 you can\nfeel civilised and use a fork\nor you can go wild and use\nyour hands. Add salt and\npepper to taste. My secret\ningredient in a salad is a\nbit of sugar \u2013 just a tiny\ntiny bit. Don\u2019t tell anyone!\nYou can use it.\nIn the end, add some\nGreek yoghurt. As\nmuch as you like \u2013 or\ndon\u2019t. I honestly cannot\ncongratulate you for managing not to ruin a salad,\nbut I will once you share\nyour very own recipe with\nme.\nGo nuts for the nuts (with\nchocolate)\nI might have a problem\nwith sweets. And when\nit\u2019s revision week, it gets\nworse. I can eat a whole\nchocolate bar in one go.\nI mean it! I am a chocolate monster when I have\nto learn something. Or, if\nI don\u2019t have chocolate, anything with enough sugar.\nAnd I am not even 100%\nsure that it\u2019s scientifically\nproven that sugar helps\nlearning \u2013 but my mom told\nme that when I was a little\ngirl and I, as a good girl,\nmust listen to my mom\u2019s\nadvice. And you should\nlisten to mine and eat as\nmuch chocolate as you can\n\u2013 at least you won\u2019t feel\nbad about it now. Just tell\nyourself that it helps you\ngo through those boring\nsoil lectures (I\u2019m assuming\nthat\u2019s all you geologists\nlearn about).\nBut if you plan to increase\nyour chocolate intake, at\nleast do it in style! Or be\nlike me, and just wolf it\ndown, you decide.\nIngredients:\n2 eggs\nsalt\n1 spoon of sugar\n1 \u00bd cups of flour (I\nrecommend white flour,\nbut anything will do as\nlong as it is not self-rising\nflour)\n1 cup milk\nOil (if you don\u2019t have a\nnon-sticky pan)\nNutella\nBananas\nStrawberries\nCream\nIngredients:\n2 eggs\n1 large chicken breast\nFeta cheese (or goat\ncheese or any creamy\ncheese you like)\n2 tomatoes\nsalad leaves\n1 small cucumber\nsmall tin of corn\n1-2 spring onion(s)\nsalt, sugar and pepper\nGreek yoghurt for\ndressing\nIngredients:\nNuts\nChocolate\nMelt chocolate. Mix with\nnuts. Attempt to wait and\neat when cold, in reality\neat when still molten and\ndelicious.\nAnd good luck with your\nexams!\n\n"

So why\ncouldn\u2019t TV\u2019s darling detective\nfind his footing this year?\nA\nfter last year\u2019s\nsomewhat\ndisappointing\nbait and switch,\nSherlock has\nfinally returned\nwith a full season this holiday\nperiod. The Six Thatchers\npicks up immediately where\nwe left off at the end of\nthe previous episode, with\nthe government leaping\ninto action over Moriarty\u2019s\nseeming return. The episode,\nhowever, quickly distances\nitself from this plot line, as if\nthe writers had realised that\nthey\u2019d backed themselves\ninto a corner by needing to\nconstantly raise the stakes.\nWe start with a helpful montage showing the passage of\ntime that quickly establishes\none of the recurring themes of\nthis episode; padding. John\nand Mary become parents,\nand Sherlock continues\nsolving cases while waiting\nfor Moriarty to play his hand.\nThankfully, this parade of\nbanality is brought to an end\nrelatively quickly, as the main\ncase of the episode quickly\ncatches our protagonist\u2019s\nattention.\nNow, credit where credit is\ndue, all the performances are\nexcellent as ever, and Cumberbatch and Freeman fall\ninto familiar grooves comfort-ably. However, this introduces\nsome issues of its own. Perhaps I\u2019m just fatigued, but the\ncharm of Sherlock\u2019s quirks is\nfading, and seeing the same\ngags rinsed repeatedly grates\nslightly. It seems as if the\ncharacters have reached the\npeak of their development,\nand the only way the writers\nseem to have of shaking\nthings up is resorting to cheap\ntricks and the reset button. It\u2019s\na real shame, since there was\npotential for really introducing a new dynamic by making\nWatson a father. However, it\nseems to go nowhere in this\nepisode.\nThe episode is overly action\nheavy, and feels like an\nattempt at a made-for-TV\nJason Bourne movie. The\naction sequences are egregious and, again, frequently\nfeel like padding. The worst\noffender here is the frustrat-ingly long sequence of Mary\nhopping around the world.\nNot much actually happens,\nplot-wise, through the course\nof the episode.\nFortunately, the humour\nis largely well executed\nin this episode. There\u2019s a\ndearth of jokes that got\na laugh out of me, and\nthe occasional extended\nmoments of self-awareness\nand lamp-shading are much\nappreciated bouts of levity.\nThe dialogue, however, is not\nalways at its best and drags\ndown the episode at points.\nAnd what of the central\nmystery? Unfortunately, the\nmystery itself isn\u2019t that inter-esting, and major event that it\nsets up is just poorly thought\nout. Firstly, the amount of contrivances and coincidences\nstretches suspension of disbe-lief, even for an episode of\nSherlock.\nThe misunderstanding at\nthe core of the plot is obvious\nto see through, and it seems\nsuspect that someone as close\nto Mary as the episode suggests would think she was the\ntraitor based on a throwaway\nsentence. Additionally, while\nthe final solution to the mystery is satisfactory, the lack\nof time spent developing\nthe perpetrator\u2019s\ncharacter\nmeans\nthat\nit is\n\\\\ Credit where\ncredit is due, all the\nperformances are\nexcellent as ever \\\\\nBlack is everyone\u2019s colour \\\\ BBC\nnowhere near as cathartic as\nit should be.\nFinally, Mary\u2019s death comes\ncompletely out of nowhere,\nand does not feel at all\nearned. It makes for a poor\nsurprise, since there is no foreshadowing or build-up, and\nsquanders perfectly good\nstorytelling opportunities.\nThe family dynamics could\nhave allowed the creators to\nexplore a lot of territory that\nisn\u2019t traditionally explored in\nMartin Freeman\u2019s really changed in a year \\\\ BBC\n\\\\ The lack of time\nspent developing the\nperpatrator\u2019s character means that it\nis nowhere near as\ncathartic as it should\nbe \\\\\nSherlock Holmes stories.\nAt the very least, it was\nsmart of creators Moffat and\nGatiss to avoid blowing the\nMoriarty load straight away\non this episode. It would have\nleft little room for the stories\nto heat up as the series went\non, and would have necessitated increasingly absurd\nplots to keep audiences\ninterested. This episode, while\nnot a complete disaster, was\nquite disappointing. While it\nleaves a bad taste in the viewers mouth, I am hopeful that it\nwon\u2019t be representative of the\nwhole series.\n\n"

The results from the\ntwo groups were remarkably\nsimilar, and showed that a\nsingle high dose of psilocybin\nwas successful in lifting anxiety\nand depression in patients\nwith advanced cancer for six\nmonths or longer.\nPsilocybin is a hallucinogenic\ncompound that, similar to\nthe related recreational\ndrug LSD, acts on serotonin\nreceptors in regions of the\nbrain responsible for nonverbal imagery and emotion.\nOverall, this produces a\ndream-like state lasting up to\neight hours, which users often\ndescribe as allowing them to\nbreak free from negativity and\nintransigence.\nThe majority of participants\nin the high-dose group\nreported having \u201cprofoundly\nmeaningful and spiritual\nexperiences\u201d during the\ntreatment session, which\nrelieved their despair and\ncaused them to re-evaluate life\nand death, ultimately leading\nto a lasting improvement in the\nquality of their lives.\nResearch on the medical\nutility of hallucinogens like\npsilocybin actually began in\npatients develop some form\nof depression or anxiety,\nwhich can in turn lead to\nreduced treatment adherence,\nprolonged hospitalization\nand early death. Currently,\nsuch syndromes are treated\nwith anti-depressants and/or\npsychological approaches,\nwith limited efficacy.\nBoth US studies involved\nthe 1950s and by 1965, over\n2000 papers had recorded\npositive results for treating\npatients with a range of\npsychiatric disorders from\ndepression to addiction, with\nno serious adverse effects.\nHowever, as recreational\nmisuse increased among\nhipster youths of the sixties\ncounter-culture, governments\nacross the globe issued a\nmoratorium on research,\neventually banning psilocybin\nuse altogether. Whilst in the\nUK, psilocybin remains a\nClass A illegal drug, the recent\nwaiving of prohibition laws for\nmedical studies has led to a\nresurgence of scientific interest\nover the past decade.\nAn estimated 40% of cancer\nlarger patient groups than\nprevious psilocybin trials (29\nand 51 participants at NYU\nand JHU respectively) and\nused a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled\napproach \u2013 the \u201cGold\nStandard\u201d of intervention-based studies. And the\nfindings are pretty conclusive\n\u2013 the single psilocybin dose\nled to an immediate reduction\nin clinician-scored depression\nand anxiety, with long-term\nimprovements in life meaning\nandoptimismreportedby80%\nof patients. The therapeutic\neffect was closely tied with\nthe transcendent nature of\npatients\u2019 experiences.\nYet these results are not\ndissimilar to those of earlier\n\\\\ The treatment\nsession relieved the\npatients\u2019 despair\nand caused them to\nre-evaluate life and\ndeath \\\\\nstudies by Professor Roland\nGriffiths (who led the JHU\nteam) using healthy volunteers,\nin which psilocybin induced\nenduring positive changes\nin life outlook and even\npersonality, suggesting that\npsychedelic treatment could\nbe applicable to a variety of\ndisorders. Ongoing research\nby Griffiths is analysing the\nefficacy of psilocybin for\nalleviating nicotine addiction,\nwhilst the therapeutic potential\nof other psychedelics,\nincluding MDMA and LSD, is\nalso under investigation.\nThe results from the two\ngroups were published with\nno less than ten commentaries\nfrom lead scientists in the fields\nof psychiatry and palliative\ncare, who all heavily back\nfurther research. \u201cThese\nfindings, the most profound\nto date in the medical use\nof psilocybin, indicate it\ncould be more effective at\ntreating serious psychiatric\ndiseases than traditional\npharmaceutical approaches,\nand without having to take a\nmedication every day\u201d, said\nGeorge Greer, director of\nthe Heffer Research Institute,\nwhich funded the trials.\nSo might our archaic drug\npolicies finally undergo\nan overhaul in the name\n\\\\ It could be\nmore effective at\ntreating serious\npsychiatric diseases\nthan traditional\npharmaceutical\napproaches and\nwithout having to\ntake a medication\nevery day\\\\\nof scientific progress? It\u2019s\nunlikely. Despite the ever-growing phenomenon of drug\nmisuse in modern society, both\nthe public and governments\nremain suspicious of\npsychedelic research. The\npopular image of psychedelics\nis tarnished not only by their\nassociation with today\u2019s \u2018rave\u2019\nscene, but by a nefarious\npast; classical hallucinogens\nwere studied historically by\nthe US military for use as\nincapacitating agents, and\nby the CIA as interrogation\ndevices. Furthermore, any\nresearch exploring alternative\nstates of consciousness\nfaces opposition from within\npsychiatry itself, with such\nexperiments often branded as\n\u2018mysticism\u2019.\nHence in order to move\nforward, psychedelic research\nmust tread carefully. Although\nhallucinogens are considered\nnon-addictive and relatively\nsafe physiologically, their\nadministration does involve\ncertain psychological\nrisks, and requires a highly\ncontrolled clinical setting,\nsupervised by professional\nobservers. Whether the\nsignificant time and cost of this\nsupport is an investment that\nour already strained NHS can\nafford remains questionable.\nBut as the nation faces an\nunprecedented epidemic\nof mental illness and dire\nshortcomings in available\ntreatments options, a\nthorough and dispassionate\nconsideration of medical\npsychedelics, uninfluenced by\nsocial and political pressures,\nmay just be a public health\nimperative.\n\\\\ Stefan B\u00f6hm Fotografie\n\n"

Again.\nThe NHS is in a\nhumanitarian\ncrisis\nStephen Naulles discusses the\ngovernment\u2019s inability to recognise\nthe current crisis at the NHS.\ncould raise an additional \u00a35bn\nin revenue; reversing the cut in\ncorporation tax could raise an\nadditional \u00a31.5bn. Neither of\nthese are particularly radical\nsuggestions if they result in a\nhealth service that is properly\nstaffed and resourced.\nThe bulk of this funding should\nbe used to increase in-patient\ncapacity, address staffing\nshortages, and bolster the\nsocial care system to reduce\nunnecessary or avoidable\nadmissions. The Conservatives\nare wrong to use spin about\nweekend mortality rates \u2013 we\nshould seek to improve outcomes over the entire week,\nacknowledging the concerns of\njunior doctors earlier this year.\nWe have a Prime Minister\nand Health Secretary going on\nnational television to debate\nthe semantics of whether the\nNHS is in a \u2018humanitarian\ncrisis\u2019, or just your regular run-of-the-mill crisis. Instead of\nfocussing on their image they\nshould sack the spin-doctors,\nand work with the real doctors\nto make sure there is no crisis to\ndebate in the first place.\nT\nhe Society of Acute Medicine\nhas revealed that the NHS\ncurrently has \u201cthird world levels\nof staffing and third world levels\nof beds\u201d. For the Red Cross,\nour NHS is in the midst of a\n\u2018humanitarian crisis\u2019. This language may\nsound vitriolic, but a crisis of this magnitude\nis something medical professionals have\nbeen warning politicians about for years.\nOver the weekend, 42 A&Es had to\ndivert patients to other hospitals due to\ntheir inability to deal with the number of\npatients coming in. Many of those that\nactually made it into the hospitals were left\non beds in corridors, a damning indictment\nof the sheer lack of capacity in our NHS at\nthe moment.\nIndeed, there has been a 212% increase\nin the number of patients waiting more\nthan 4 hours to be treated, and A&E\nattendances over the last ten years have\nincreased from 16.5M to 21.8M. We constantly hear about the mounting challenge\nposed by an ageing population. Surely\nthen it follows that we will have boosted\nour ability to cope with these additional\npressures? Evidently not. Acute in-patient\ncapacity is being reduced in many trusts\nas part of the government\u2019s sustainability\nand transformation plans; an elaborate\ncost-cutting exercise which places meeting\nfinancial targets in the name of \u2018efficiency\nsavings\u2019 over patient safety. The Kings Fund\nestimates that NHS providers and commissioners ended 2015/16 with a \u00a31.85 billion\nfinancial deficit. All of this coming from a\ngovernment claiming to have learned from\nthe mistakes of Mid-Staffs and vowing to\nnever put financial obligations before\npatient safety.\nThe answer to the crisis lies in progressive taxation reform, not budgetary cuts.\nDespite us now being the world\u2019s 6th\nbiggest\neconomy (thanks Brexit), we spend just over\n8% of GDP on healthcare. The IFS estimates\nthat a 1% increase in the rate of income tax\nO\nne of my 2017 felix-related resolutions was\nto diversify my activist\nfeelings away from\nthe environment. Not\nthat I\u2019m bored about\ntalking about it \u2013 not at all. Every week\nthere seems to be some lab somewhere\nmaking breakthroughs on green energies,\nnew legislation about restricting urban\ntransport, or an international agreement to\nreduce our carbon emissions. And if that\u2019s\nnot the case, there\u2019s always Trump sharing\nhis insightful thoughts about how we\u2019re all\nmaking this greenhouse gas stuff up after\nall. Anyway the point was that there\u2019s a\nthousand other causes that are also worth\nprotesting weekly about, but Lef asked me\nto write about climate change, so blame\nhim.\nThis week in climate change news we\nhave a giant iceberg, the size of Trinidad\nand Tobago, threatening to break off from\nthe Antarctic ice shelf, which could lead to\na global ocean rise of 10 cm. Big iceberg\nor not, temperature and sea level rises have\nbeen reported for the past few decades,\nwith human activity being deemed directly\nresponsible (sorry Trump, there\u2019s evidence).\nIf you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019re probably thinking either (a) \u201cI know this, and\nI don\u2019t care- some UN people will make\nsure everything is alright and Venice won\u2019t\nbecome Atlantis any time soon\u201d or (b) \u201cI\nknow this, and I do things in my power to\nfight it (recycle/buy one of those reusable coffee cups/am vegetarian, etc...)\u201d. I\npersonally proudly sat in the library this\nafternoon researching decarbonisation of\nUK electricity sources for my coursework\nand thinking to myself how nice it feels to\nbe in category (b).\nAnd then for a second, the paradox struck\nme that while we\u2019re all here happily dreaming about a fossil-free world, Imperial, with\nits world leading leaders in renewable\nenergies, cutting edge clean technology\nlabs and environmentally\nmindful individuals, is investing over 4 million pounds of its\nendowment directly in oil, coal\nand gas. Indeed, while leading\nuniversities worldwide, from\nStanford to Glasgow, have\nmanaged to almost entirely\ndivest from fossil fuels, Imperial is currently ranked 96th\non\nthe People and Planet 2016\nUniversity League, reflecting\nits lack of involvement in environmental issues. UCL is 29th,\njust saying.\nI\u2019ve tried to understand the\nlogic behind this, but even after\ntalking to Imperial\u2019s Energy\nManager about the issue, I\nam convinced that nobody\ncares how much coal we burn\nto power our green technology research labs \u2013 such is\nthe currency of a degree from\nImperial. I feel like not only\nshould we care, but demand\nan ethical investment policy\nfrom our institution and thank-fully, there\u2019s a great bunch\nof people called Fossil Free\nImperial who do just that. So\nspare a few seconds of busy\nstudent life to check out their\nFacebook page and sign their\npetition. Island-sized icebergs\nare breaking off after all.\nDecolonising\nphilosophy?\nSOAS, get real!\nJian Li Chew discusses\ndecolonisation,philosophy, and special\nsnowflakes.\n\\\\ the SOAS\nStudent Union\nwants the university\nto decolonise its\nphilosophy to remove\nPlato, Descartes and\nKant \\\\\nS\no The Telegraph\nreported that the\nSOAS\u2019s Student\nUnion wants\nthe university to\ndecolonise its\nphilosophy to remove Plato,\nDescartes and Kant. I read\nit just after having a pint\nof ale at Eastside to forget\nthe tragedy that was my\nStructural Mechanics paper\nand my Asian flush made my\nface redder than the time I\nconfessed my feelings to that\ngirl two years ago \u2013 (She\nvery politely rejected me). You\nmay ask me, \u201cBut didn\u2019t you\ndecolonise your life and go to\nChina to be a farmer?\u201d Let\u2019s\njust say that my mum found out\nand beat some sense into me.\nAlso, I can\u2019t fly. I now have to\nface the horrifying reality that\nI can\u2019t blame white people\nfor everything and to take\nSo back on topic: SOAS\nSU said that the majority\nof philosophers they learn\nabout should be African and\nAsian, and the university\nshould address the \u201clegacy\nof colonialism\u201d. Now I was\nabout to go on that whole\nrigmarole of decolonising\nmy life all over again, but it\njust made me angry. Angry\nabout the state of our generation and how our culture\nhad gone so horribly wrong.\nTo clarify my views on\ncolonialism, it was indeed\nhorrid, fuelled by greed\nand patronising ideas of\nethnic superiority, leading\nto massive death and suf-fering; however, history has\nalways been about death\nand suffering, with European colonialism merely\nthe latest and most industrialised form of it. I don\u2019t\nsee these people lamenting the massive destruction\nfollowing the Mongol inva-sions, the Mughal invasion\nof India, and the fact that\nAfrican slavery was carried\nout by indigenous African tribes decimating their\nenemies. Colonialism was\nalso not a zero-sum game\nof the white man oppressing the natives. It was an\ninterchange between the\nrich and powerful elites on\nboth sides collaborating to\nbenefit themselves, while\nthe vast majority of people\nwere simply trying to sur-vive. Colonialism also led\nto massive benefits for the\ncolonised in some cases.\nIn my case, schools set up\nby Christian missionaries in Malaysia educated\nmy parents (and an entire\nimpoverished Chinese and\nIndians fleeing poverty, war,\nand discrimination.\nOn the point of knowledge\nand education, people have\nalways learnt from each\nother. Witness how the\nmuslim Arabs preserved the\nvaluable knowledge and\nteachings of the Greeks,\nhow Southeast Asian cultures developed under\nthe Indian Hindu/Buddhist\ncultural sphere and how\nEurope learnt from the\nAncient Romans, Greeks,\nChinese and Arabs to kick\nstart the Renaissance. SOAS\nstudents may have a point\nabout under-representa-tion of African and Asian\nphilosophy, but Plato, Descartes, and Kant are part\nand parcel of humanity\u2019s\nintellectual heritage and to\ndemand their removal from\nthe syllabus is stupid and\nbeside the point.\nAll knowledge is important and valuable. The fact\ngeneration), pushing them\nout of poverty. Modern\nmedicine kept us alive, and\nMalaysia was a land of\nresponsibility for my actions.\nremains that European\ncivilisation has had and\ncontinues to have an outsize\nimpact on modern society,\nand to understand the world\nwe live in, we have to learn\nabout it. Education is about\ncreating a well-rounded,\nopen-minded individual\nwho can think critically. This\narrangement is not going\nto create that. Instead the\nSOAS Student Union simply\nwants to create racist, nar-row-minded, brainwashed,\nand hateful idiots.\nI\u2019d like to point out the\nhypocrisy of claiming to\nfight racism and institutional\n\\\\ Instead the\nSOAS Student\nUnion simply wants\nto create racist,\nnarrow-minded,\nbrainwashed, and\nhateful idiots \\\\\nopportunity for millions of\ndiscrimination, but yet\n\\\\ These people\nepitomise the hate,\nbigotry, ignorance and\nracism which they claim\nto fight \\\\\npushing through an ideology\nof disdain for white people,\nfor \u2018white civilisation\u2019 and\nfor \u2018white knowledge\u2019.\nUnfortunately this feeds\ninto a wider \u2018snowflake\u2019 society where freedom of speech\nand now even freedom to\nlearn are being curtailed in\norder not to \u2018offend\u2019 people,\nand where the boundary of\nwhat is \u2018offensive\u2019 grows\nday after day.We are also\nseeing how censorship is\nbeing pushed in under our\nnoses in the guise of political\ncorrectness, to control what\nwe can see, read, and think.\nNo. I shan\u2019t and won\u2019t let\nthese stupid people define\nme and my generation, the\nmost educated, tolerant,\nand well-off in history.\nTo summarise, even if\ntheir claims of African and\nAsian philosophy being\nunder-represented is valid,\nbanning white philosophers\nis a stupid and ignorant\nthing to do, especially in a\nuniversity in the UK, which\nincidentally is part of Europe\nand has developed under its\ncultural sphere. The SOAS\nStudent Union is belabour-ing a moot point and making\nfools of themselves and our\ngeneration, because even if\nthey are snowflakes, most\nyoung people aren\u2019t. These\npeople epitomise the hate,\nbigotry, ignorance, and\nracism which they claim to\nfight. You may say that we\nhave to tolerate or accept\nthose views, but tolerance\nof intolerance is cowardice,\nand will ultimately erode\nthe freedoms and rights we\ncherish. The SOAS Student\nUnion should focus their\nenergies on relevant issues,\nnot this load of rubbish.\n\n"

In response\nwe were contacted by Cruelty\nFree International and given a\npress release from the animal\nrights group.\nIt\u2019s worth noting here that\nthe British Union for the\nAbolition of Vivisection that\npublished the controversial\nundercover investigation in\nApril 2013 merged with its\nsister organization Cruelty\nFree International in March\nof last year, taking on their\nname and branding.\nCruelty Free International\nhave responded to the news\nof the report but stating that\n\u201cit is deeply ironic that the\nCollege has been given an\naward for openness \u2013 by\nthe main pro-vivisection\nlobby group \u2013 when it\nrecently fought Cruelty Free\nInternational tooth and nail\nnot to disclose how many\nhours care staff are on\nduty.\u201d\nThis comes back to the\nImperial Animal Research\nAnnual Report from\n2014, which Cruelty Free\nInternational challenged\nfor the reference to \u2018round\nthe clock\u2019 or \u201824/7\u2019 care.\nThe actual quote from the\nReport states \u201cIn addition to\nworld-class facilities, we are\nalso committed to providing\nround the clock care for all\nour animals, with at least\none veterinarian and five\nsenior animal care staff on\ncall 24/7\u201d, says Mandy\nThorpe, Director of Central\nBiomedical Services (CBS).\n\u201cWe also monitor the\nanimals\u2019 environment night\nand day, and if conditions\nfall outside of the Home\nOffice Code of Practice, we\nwill be notified by text and\nemail alerts.\u201d\nThe Cruelty Free\nInternational response to the\naward continues \u201cWe now\nknow \u2013 after the College lost\nour case at the Information\nTribunal \u2013 that care staff\nare on duty only from 8am\nto 5pm, considerably less\non weekends and public\nholidays.

Almeida\u2019s staging features Andrew\nScott (of Moriarty fame) in his first performance\nin the role. Director Robert Icke is known for his\nstartling updates on classic works. His last work at\nthe Almeida was Chekov\u2019s Uncle Vanya whose star,\nJessica Findlay Brown, returns in his Hamlet as Ophelia. Icke\u2019s plays skewer audience perceptions\nand expectations and challenge them to consider seminal works of literature as starkly modern and\nrelevant commentaries. When he staged 1984 at the Almeida in 2014 in our modern world of constant\nsurveillance a few years ago, a couple of audience members fainted during the torture scenes,\nthough the stage was dark and nothing was shown. In an interview with The Financial Times earlier\nlast year, he spoke of what compels him to reinvent classics to inject them with such vital and present\nenergy, in Hamlet Icke wants to ask \u201cto sit there in 1599 and watch this play that speaks directly to\nyour anxiety: what does that feel like?\u201d\nThis term in Arts\nI\nt\u2019s safe to say that 2016 wasn\u2019t kind to the world of culture. In a year of blow after blow to the pantheon of\niconic cultural stars, the passing of two more bright lights \u2013 Carrie Fisher and her mother Debbie Reynolds\n\u2013 left the arts world reeling once more. 2017 brings with it a new hope that we\u2019ve left the curse of the past\nyear behind us \u2013 at least in the world of art, dance, and theatre (the political climate of course is quite\nanother matter). A brand new year means brand new shows and exhibitions to look forward to; in less than\na week the first tickets for Hamilton will be put on sale, just as the cast of Lin Manuel Miranda\u2019s other great\nmusical In the Heights take their final bows in the West End. Hamilton will land in London in October, but before\nthat there\u2019s lots, lots more to get excited about, here are our 3 top picks for this term...\nIndira Mallik gives her tips for a term full of culture\nT\nhere\u2019s no shortage of the female form\nin art, from medieval Maddonas to\nRenaissance goddesses, to Anish\nKapoor's Queen\u2019s vagina on the\nground of the Versailles, but in these\nworks womanhood is filtered through\nthe lens of the male gaze. In the art world,\nwomen are often portrayed as no more than\nmale fantasies, as Margaret Atwood writes in\nThe Robber Bride, the experience of navigating\nthis world can be a discombobulating\nexperience: \u201cyou are a woman with a man\ninside watching a woman. You are your own\nvoyeur.\u201d In their haunting collage piece Do\nWomen Have to Be Naked to Get into the Met.\nMuseum the Guerrilla Girls state that whilst\n85% of the nudes in the modern art section in\nthe Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York\nare female, only 5% are by female artists. This\nnew exhibition staged by the Whitechapel\nGallery and The National Museum of Women\nin the Arts in Washington is an all-female show\nexploring womanhood through the mediums of\nvideo and photography. The 17 contemporary\nartists featured include Marina Abhramovic,\nAnna Gaskell, and Rineke Dijkstra. Their work\nwill present the 'female body as a vital medium\nfor storytelling, expressing identity and\nreflecting individual and collective experience'.\nTerrains of the Body |\nPhotography from the National Museum of Women in the\nArts\nWhere? \u2013 Whitechapel Gallery\nWhen? \u2013 18th Jan-16th April 2017\nHow Much? \u2013 Free\nHamlet\nWhere? \u2013 Almeida Theatre\nWhen? \u2013 17th February-8th April\n2017\nHow Much? \u2013 from \u00a310\nBallet Black\nWhere? \u2013 Barbican\nWhen? \u2013 2nd-3rd March 2-17\nHow Much? \u2013 from \u00a316\nA\nsingle trip to any of the ballet productions being staged in London every day can\nmake it abundantly clear how great the lack of diversity is in the ballet world. Why\nthis should be so has its roots in economic inequality, lack of representation and the\never-present spectre of entrenched racism. In March, the Barbican will be hosting\nBallet Black, a small company for international dancers of black and Asian descent for\nthe second time. Since its founding in 2001, the troupe has been critically acclaimed,\nwinning the 2012 Critics' Circle National Dance Award for Best Independent Company. Led by artistic\ndirector Cassa Pancho, the classically trained troupe have been roundly lauded for their virtuoso\nperformances of original choreography. Their second Barbican show will once again be a triple bill\nof original performances each with a different choreographer. Martin Lawrance and Michael Corder\nwill create edgy, abstract performances to sumptuous orchestral music, while in the third, South\nBank Sky Arts Award-winner Annabelle Lopez Ochoa adapts Little Red Riding Hood as a surprising,\nchilling, feminist ballet.\nAndrew\nScot\nt\nm\na\nk\ne\ns\nh\ni\ns\nA\nl\nm\ne\ni\nd\na\nd\ne\nb\nu\nt\ni\nn\nH\na\nm\nl\ne\nt\n\\\n\\\nA\nl\nm\ne\ni\nd\na\nH\nellen\nvan Meene, Untitled (79), (2000), detai\nl\n\\\n\\\nH\ne\nl\nl\ne\nn\nv\na\nn\nM\ne\ne\nn\ne/\nY\na\nn\nc\ne\ny\nR\ni\nc\nh\na\nr\nd\ns\no\nn\nG\na\nl\nl\ne\nr\ny\n\n"

    "content": "felix\nM I L L E N N I A L S\nFriday 13 January 2017 21\nmillennials.felix@ic.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk/millennials\nIt\u2019s a new year and a new term, most definitely filled with new lectures, problem sheets and\ncoursework to stress over. Luckily, there\u2019s also a number of upcoming games to enjoy and\nprocrastinate with. So without further ado, here are the games that should really be on your\nradar, as recommended by Saad Ahmed\nMost anticipated games of 2017\nMass Effect: Andromeda\nThe Mass Effect series was iconic and\nwell deserving of all its recognition. Its\nending may have been polarising but it\ndid not take away from the hours of rich\ngame play and world building. It was a\nthrill to learn that another entry in the\nseries was coming. Although not much is\nknown about this particular game, the limited footage we\u2019ve seen was slick and all\nthe familiar mechanics we know and love\n- conversations, romances, and shooting\nthings - are back in action. With a release\ndate of 21st\nMarch, the hype level of fans\nis off the charts.\nYooka-Laylee\nMade from one of the biggest kick\nstarters of 2015, this colourful game looks\nto recreate the fun and glee of old N64\ngames. Along the duo of Yooka the chameleon and Laylee the bat, players will\nget to explore huge, breathtaking worlds,\ninteract with a whole host of colourful\ncharacters and collect as many\u2026well...\ncollectibles as one possible can. A lighter\nentry in terms of feel and tone but one\nwhich promises a lot of fun.\nResident Evil 7: Biohazard\nResident Evil was a series whose focus\nchanged with different instalments but the\nlatest entry is set to bring back everything\nthat defined the franchise in the first\nplace. Exploring a creepy old mansion,\nthis survival horror is expected to give\nplayers a constant feeling of dread and\nsuspense. Because this is the first game of\nthe series that will be in first person, the\nchilling scares are set to be all the more\nterrifying. This game is even fully playable in VR for those brave souls amongst\nus wanting the extra layer of tension.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath\nof the Wild\nArguably one of the most anticipated\ngames on this list, the latest Legend of\nZelda is going to be released on the Wii\nU and the new upcoming Switch. The trailers have given us a look into a new model\nwith a truly beautiful landscape. Hyrule\nis now a complete open world where you\ncan enter dungeons as you wish, weapons now degrade over time and you need\nto forage for food and items. Fans have\nbeen waiting for this game for well over\na year and hopes are riding high on the\nlatest of Link\u2019s adventures.\nInjustice 2\nAnother sequel (sensing a trend yet?)\ncoming this year is Nether Realm\u2019s Injustice 2. Injustice was well known for pitting\nthe heroes and villains of DC comics\nagainst each other. Compared to the\nfirst game, this one will allow players to\nearn and unlock upgrades to characters,\ngiving this fighting game an RPG element\nto it. With the developer saying it will\nhave the largest roster of any DC fighting\ngame up until now, it will be interesting to\nsee how this one fares.\nFor Honour\nWith intense melee combat between\nknights, samurai, and even vikings, this\ngame definitely sounds like it will be\npopular. This is all about sword duels in\nthe midst of large battles, as players aim\nto anticipate enemy attacks, read their\nstances and properly strategize to land\nthe killing blow. Other than this, there\nis said to be a single player campaign\nthat is touted to be varied and engag-ing; if this game kicks off, Ubisoft will\nhave another franchise to keep gamers\nhooked.\n\\\\ Bioware\n\\\\ Playtonic Games\n\\\\ NetherRealm Studios\n\\\\ Ubisoft\n\\\\ Nintendo\n\\\\ Capcom\nThere are plenty of other games on the horizons apart from our picks, with new entries also announced in the Fallout, Assassins\nCreed and Uncharted series. Regardless of what console you may have, there\u2019s definitely going to be something for everyone\nand 2017 looks to be a great year for gamers.\n\n"

I am as much of a stickler\nfor traditions like new year\u2019s\nresolutions as I am for marriage\nto be between a man and a\nwoman, and just like marriage as\nGod intended it to be, none of my\nresolutions have anything to do\nwith homosexuals.\nAs it is a new year, I have\ndecided that I will take up a\nnew hobby; however, I am\nindecisive as to which hobby I\nshould take up. First of all there\nis hunting. While On the one\nhand I love the idea of killing\ncreatures that are weaker than\nme, on the other hand having\nto pay a licence and letting the\ngovernment known what kind\nof weapons I possess doesn\u2019t sit\nwell with me. Another hobby I\nhave been considering is one\nthat I\u2018d taken up in my youth\nand I\u2019m sure I must still have the\noutfit in my attic somewhere. I\njust don\u2019t know, if I still have the\nenergy for all that cross burning\nand lynching. The fact that there\nwill be a much larger intake of\nmembers soon due to the fact\nthat being openly racist is now\na presidential characteristic is\nalso discouraging \u2013 I bet that\nsome of them won\u2019t even remember Rosa Parks and how she\nruined buses for everyone.\nAnother resolution I made was\nto become a more respectable\nand likeable person in that\nnew-age holistic way. I guess if\nI start to model myself more on\nPresident Trump then perhaps I\ncan start to feel more in touch\nwith the youth of today. First\nstep will be to make a disabled friend who I can make fun\nof \u2013 my guess is if people see\nme making fun of tards they\nwill accept me into the fold. I\nthink in regards to my attitude\ntowards women I am perhaps\na little too soft \u2013 if I can train\nmy one to stop answering back\nthen that will hopefully elevate\npeople\u2019s opinions of me. All in\nall, we have no idea as to what\nthis new year holds for all of\nus, but as long as it involves the\nimprisonment of transexuals and\nliberal crooks, it\u2019s gonna be a\ngood one.\nI\nhope you all had a relaxing,\nenvironmentally friendly\nchristmas, filled with as many\ncarbon neutral gifts as there\nare genders. 2016 was, as\nmany of you known, the death\nof progressive politics and free\nthought, so as a result of entering\nthe new year I have decided to\nindulge in the ancient tradition of\ndeclaring \u201cnew year, new me!\u201d.\nOf course I am a vegan (just in\ncase you didn\u2019t already know)\nand hence I am already morally\npure and perfect; however,\neven perfection has room for\nimprovement. My new year\u2019s\nresolutions are threefold: 1) To get\nmore in touch with my common\nman/woman/gender neutral thing\n2) To become far closer to nature\nand 3) To be more patient with\nother people.\nMany writers into this weekly\ncolumn have told me that many\nof my views are \u2018elitist\u2019 and\n\u2018privileged\u2019 although frankly\nthat sounds like something a\npoor person would say. With\nthat said, however, I am not\nafraid to change (unlike the\nnumerous gender normative\ntoilets across the campuses of\nImperial), and indeed I have\ndecided that I will indulge in\nthe activities of the lower, less\neco-friendly members of our\nsociety. At least once a week I\nwill attempt to drink a lager that\nis not made from organic hops;\nI shall attend one organised\nsports parade a month although\nI feel as though I shall have to\ncall in advance to ask what their\nvegan meal choices provided\nfor the intermission are.\nIn order to become even closer\nto nature and life than I already\nam, I have decided to start\nsleeping with a pig. Of course it\nwill be completely platonic, but\nif things start to happen\u2026 well\nthe heart wants what the heart\nwants. Furthermore, how much\ncloser to nature can you get\nthan literally inside an animal?\nPigs have been found to be\nable to experience pleasure as\nwell and of course it would be\nconsensual.\nThirdly I must of course be\nmore patient with those not on\nan exclusively dairy-free-quinoa\nonly diet. When people try to\ntell me that there are only two\ngenders, I will take a deep\nbreath and then try to find a\nconstructive way to tell their\ncis-pig selves that they have\nobviously missed out at least six\nothers. When people try to tell\nme that fat people are endangering themselves and are a\nburden on the health service, I\nwill tell them to shut their skin-ny-bitch-over-privileged mouth\nand that they should recognise\nthat all shapes are beautiful.\nEven the ones that cause coronary heart disease. 2017 looks\nto be an awful year but who\nknows? Perhaps Hillary did get\nmore votes than Trump and will\nactually get to be president.\nNew year\u2019s resolutions\nare hard to come\nup with when you\u2019re\nperfect\nJonathan Masters will tolerate\nyour ignorant , fat-shaming ass\neven though you don\u2019t deserve it\n2017 seems full of\npromise after the\ngreat year that\n2016 was\nMonathan Jasters is excited to\nsee trends and attidutes come\nback from last century\nS\nV\n* Sponsored by\nAIM\nwhitening\ngel toothpaste\n\n"

Whilst\nMDMA may often be bombed (a process\nwhereby the drug is wrapped in a small\npiece of tissue or cigarette paper and\nthen swallowed like a pill) in order to\nprolong the effects, this is counter-pro-ductive when taking mephedrone due\nto the much shorter effects experienced anyway. Basically, the amount\nof time that would be added by taking\nmephedrone in this manner would not be\nwarranted by the increased method of\npreparation.\nLegality\nMephedrone has been illegal since 2010. Being a class B drug puts mephedrone in the same\ngroup as other substances such as cannabis and ketamine. As a result, if caught in possession\nyou could acquire a prison sentence of up to five years and an unlimited fine. This situation\nis decidedly worse if caught in possession with intent to supply. This could result in up to fourteen years in prison and a potentially unlimited fine.\nThings to do when you\u2019re high\nDo\n\u2022 Make sure you\u2019re in\nan environment you\u2019re\ncomfortable with.\n\u2022 Place a limit on how\nmuch you will take.\nWhilst experiencing a\ncomedown, you will\nwant \u2018one more line\u2019,\nplacing a limit helps\nprevent this.\n\u2022 Take it with friends\nyou trust. Whilst on\nmephedrone, due to\nthe increased confidence you will feel, you\nwill end up revealing\nyour deepest darkest\nsecrets.\nDon\u2019t\n\u2022 Let yourself be peer\npressured. Drugs are a\nserious choice, you don\u2019t\nhave to take anything.\nEspecially if you\u2019ve unintentionally found yourself\nin a chemsex party on a\nfriday night\n\u2022 Drink excessively whilst\non mephedrone. Struggling to stand up being\ndrunk whilst simultaneously rushing is not a\npleasing experience.\n\u2022 Mix with other uppers, a\ncombination of MDMA.\nand mephedrone will\nensure you don\u2019t go to\nsleep for days.\nWhat it does\nMephedrone is a potent stimulant. Users expect to\nfeel short rushes, alertness and confidence. Whilst\nthe effects are not dissimilar to cocaine and MDMA,\nwhen taking, anticipate a much shorter experience\nthan either of these other drugs. Whilst the influence\nof cocaine lasts between forty minutes and an hour\ndepending on the strength of the drug and method of\ningestion, mephedrone affects the user for no more\nthan typically thirty minutes. After this period expect\na severe comedown, a much harder crash than other\ndrugs (heroin notwithstanding). Whilst the comedown\nmay not be physical (there are no physical effects\non the body due to the comedown), mentally users\nexpect to be consistently wanting one more line, commonly referred to as fiending. Mephedrone causes a\nmuch more intense experience than cocaine, which\ngoes some distance to explaining the more addictive\ncomedown.\nSome statistics\nAccording to the government, 1.9% of people aged\nbetween sixteen and twenty four took mephedrone\nbetween 2014 and 2015. This is well below other popular\ndrugs such as cocaine (4.8%), ecstasy (5.4%) and cannabis (16.3%). From this we can conclude that mephedrone\nis not the most popular of drugs in the UK. However, this\nwriter believes it is best to cover a whole range of drugs\nin felix, in order to provide the most comprehensive drug\neducation possible.\nMeph\nImperial College has a strict zero tolerance policy on drugs.\nIf you\u2019re struggling with drug use, visit talktofrank.com\nPrices\nMephedrone is notoriously cheap. Expect to pay somewhere in the region of \u00a315-20 for\na gram. Although mephedrone is relatively unheard of in London, in certain regions and\nscenes such as the north of England and the gay chemsex scene (obviously just a weird, weird\ncoincidence) it is the drug of choice. In cities such as Manchester and Sheffield prices can be\nas low as \u00a325-30 for an eighth (3.5g). Whilst cocaine is often rated on its purity, which in turn\ncan affect the price enormously, there is no such metric for mephedrone. This writer has never\nheard of \u2018pure mephedrone\u2019 for sale. Your best bet for a continuous supply of good mephe-drone is a find a dealer you trust and hopefully your return business will persuade them they\ndon\u2019t need to sell you the crap stuff.\nMDog\nBubble\nBounce\nmeow\nGlossary\nRushing \u2013 Term used when experiencing increased levels\nof alertness and confidence. Used in a sentence as simply\n\u2018I\u2019m rushing\u2019.\nFiending \u2013 Used to express wanting more mephedrone\nwhen coming down. . For example, \u2018Now I\u2019ve stopped\nrushing, I\u2019m fiending\u2019.\nGram \u2013 The common unit when buying mephedrone is\na gram, similar to buying other uppers. Larger weights\ncan be bought if you\u2019re richer than the rest of us. Smaller\nweights can also be bought if you\u2019re just looking for a\nquick hit.\n\n"

The introduction of\nNational Student Survey open for 2017\nNational Union for Students calls to boycott\nLef Apostolakis\nhas admitted is a test pilot,\nand using it to dramatically\nreshape the university\nlandscape across England,\nwith unknown economic and\nsocial impacts,\u201d she writes.\nThe NUS will be\ncoordinating a nationwide\nboycott of the NSS. Vieru\u2019s\nappeal encourages students\nto stay strong and resist\nselling out. \u201cDon\u2019t allow your\nfeedback to be used against\nyou, don\u2019t fill in the NSS. Not\nfor a free coffee, not for an\nAmazon voucher, not even\nfor a crack at a free iPad.\n\u201cBy boycotting, students\nwill use the NSS for its true\npurpose \u2013 to show that we\nare incredibly dissatisfied.\nNot necessarily with our\ncourses or the university,\nbut with the government and\nits attempts to dishonestly\nsuggest it cares about the\nquality of our teaching, when\nreally it\u2019s just trying to raise\nfees again.\u201d\nthe framework is supposed\nto \u201censure all students\nreceive an excellent teaching\nexperience that encourages\noriginal thinking\u201d according\nto Minister for Universities\nand Science Jo Johnson.\nHowever it has been widely\ncriticised and even despite\namendments last November,\nconcernsremain.AsProfessor\nStephen Curry told felix\nearlier last year \u201c [TEF] still\nrisks becoming burdensome\nand too heavily driven by\nmetrics which (as we all\nknow) do a very poor job of\ncapturing or characterising\neducational quality, which is\nthe thing that students, staff\nand government all ought to\nbe working together on.\u201d\nTEF also remains unpopular\nwith the National Union of\nStudents (NUS). Earlier last\nyear a national education\ndemo took place demanding\n\u201cno ifs, not buts, no education\ncuts\u201d. In a recent article\nfor the Guardian, Sorana\nVieru, vice-president higher\neducation for the NUS denied\nany value to the NSS when\nit comes down to improving\nquality of teaching.\n\u201cTEF is a tool by which\nto raise tuition fees, taking\na poorly thought through\napproximation of teaching\nquality that Johnson himself\nNo more emails about the NSS \\\\ felix\n\\\\ TEF is a tool\nby which to raise\ntuition fees \\\\\n\\\\ By boycotting,\nstudents will use\nthe NSS for its\ntrue purpose \u2013\nto show that we\nare incredibly\ndissatisfied \\\\\nFirefighters swarm the Science Museum\nLef Apostolakis\nJ\nust before noon\nlast Wedensday,\nhundreds of visitors\nwere evacuated\nfrom the Science\nMuseum. As the\nvisitors collected outside the\nmuseum on Exhibition Road,\nthree firefighter squads arrived\nand created a perimeter\naround the historical building,\namounting to a total of seven\nfire engines with aerial support\nfrom a helicopter.\nThe firefighters were\nresponding to an automatic\nfire alarm that had somehow\nbeen triggered.\nWhile the firefighters\nentered the museum looking\nfor the source of the suspected fire, Museum staff\nentertained children with\ngames, to prevent the young\nexplorers\u2019 investigative day\nfrom losing momentum.\nSome children were led to\nthe neighbouring Latter Day\nSaints Church to keep them\nwarm.\nImperial College students\nappeared mesmerised by the\nred shiny fire engines.\nWhen it was verified that\nthere was no fire, only an\nalarm malfunction, Imperial\nCollege security opened the\nFalmouth Gate onto Queen\u2019s\nGate to help the firefighter\nsquads get out. The gate is\nonly supposed to be opened\nfor the Queen.\nThis is already the second\ntime in 2017 that Exhibition Road gets packed\nwith swarms of evacuated\nmuseum-goers. About a week\nearlier, visitors had to be\nevacuated due to a bomb\nthreat directed at the neighbouring Victoria and Albert\nmuseum. The threat turned\nout to be a hoax.\nThat awkward moment something exciting happens at Imperial \\\\ felix\n\n"

Although\nperhaps nothing more than\nwell-intentioned nagging at\nthe time, new research has\nshed light on a novel scientific\nreason for shovelling in that\ndaily fibre.\nIn an article recently published in Cell, an international\nteam of researchers used a\nmouse model to investigate\nthe impact of dietary fibre\ndeprivation on resident gut\nmicrobes and the consequences for the health of the\ndigestive system.\nTheir findings were a little\ndisconcerting. As it turns out,\nwhen starving, our suddenly\nnot-so-friendly gut bacteria\nfeed instead on the natural\nmucus layer lining the gut\nwall, eroding it to the point\nthat pathogenic bacteria can\ninvade and instigate disease.\nThe intestinal mucus layer\nforms a critical first line of\ndefence against infection by\npotentially harmful microbes.\nMucus also serves as an\nalternative nutrient source for\nresident bacterial communi-ties, which rely primarily on\ndietary carbohydrates, especially fibre, for energy.\nThe modern diet of western\nnations is inherently lacking in\nfibre, a deficit which has been\nlinked to increased incidence\nof inflammatory diseases\nincluding asthma, allergies\nand irritable bowel disease\n(IBD).\nThe team of scientists led by\nEric Martens at the University\nof Michigan Medical School,\ntogether with his former\npost-doctoral fellow Mahesh\nDesai, developed a novel\nmouse model which lacked\nany microbes of its own, but\ncontained a transplanted\nmicrobiota comprising 14\nselected species of human\ngut bacteria. Between them,\nthese species were capable of\nproducing ~1700 carbohy-drate-digesting enzymes,\nsimilar to the number secreted\nby the 500 \u2013 1000 species\ncontained in a typical human\ngut.\nIt was found that when the\nmice were subjected to a diet\nregime which was deficient\nin complex plant fibre,\nthe composition of the gut\nmicrobiota shifted from containing largely fibre-digesting\nbacteria, to one abundant\nin mucus-degrading species\n\u2013 a trend that has also been\nobserved in IBD patients.\nNotably, fluctuations\noccurred extremely rapidly,\nmirroring the daily alternations between fibre-rich and\nfibre-free diets.\n\u201cThe lesson we\u2019re learning\nfrom studying the interaction\nof fibre, gut microbes and the\nintestinal barrier system is that\nif you don\u2019t feed them, they\ncan eat you,\u201d said Martens.\nAnd indeed, as the number of\nmucus-digesting gut bacteria\nincreased, thinning of the\nmucus layer was seen in the\ncolons of fibre-starved mice.\nInterestingly, when mice\nwere fed prebiotics \u2013 puri-fied, soluble carbohydrates\ncommercially purported\nto stimulate the growth of\n\u2018friendly\u2019 gut bacteria \u2013 the\nsame changes in microbiota\nprofile and mucus thickness\nwere observed as in mice on\nthe fibre-free diet. Let\u2019s hope\nbuyers kept their receipts.\nColonisation of the human\ngut by pathogenic bacteria \u2013 for instance, E. coli,\na common culprit of food\npoisoning \u2013 causes severe\ndiarrhoeal disease, amounting to substantial health-care\ncosts. In order to access the\ngut wall and exert pathogenic\neffects, these bacteria must\nfirst get through the gut mucus\nlayer.\nHence unsurprisingly, when\ninfected with C. rodentium,\nthe rodent equivalent of\nhuman E. coli, mice on the\nlow-fibre regime were ~10-fold more susceptible to\ncolonisation than those fed a\nfibre-rich diet. This higher colonisation was accompanied\nby severe inflammation of the\ncolon, with over half of the\nmice losing at least 20% of\ntheir original body weight.\nWhilst the health benefits of\ndietary fibre have long been\nrecognised, the mechanisms\nlinking fibre deficiency to\ndisease risk have, until now,\nremained elusive.\nThe findings of Martens and\nhis team have underscored\nhow even subtle changes in\nthe balance of our resident\nmicrobial species can strongly\ninfluence host-microbiota\ninteractions and our vulnerability to diverse diseases.\nThese include not only enteric\ninfections but also metabolic\nsyndromes, inflammatory\nconditions, cancer, and even\nParkinson\u2019s disease.\nPerhaps most alarming\nabout these findings is the\nspeed at which, with externally applied forces (e.g. diet\nor antibiotics) we can unknowingly effect major behavioural\nalterations in our microbial\ncontrol hubs. And not always\nfor the better.\nHowever, on the upside of\nthis, the malleability of our\ngut residents opens the door\nto new methods by which we\ncan manipulate the microbi-ota to improve human health\nand even treat disease. So\nfar, experimental microbio-ta-orientated therapies have\ncentred on faecal microbiota\ntransplant (FMT; yep, it\u2019s\nwhat it says on the tin) \u2013 a\ntechnique which involves considerable procedural burden.\nFuture experiments by Martens and Desai will explore\nthe prospect of using dietary\ntherapeutics as a simpler\nalternative to FMT. Until then,\nshould we follow the example\nset by Blue Zones and move\ntowards a more plant-based\ndiet?\nF\nact: There is a\njellyfish that can\nlive forever.\nTurritopsis dohr-nii, a small blob\nfloating in the sea\noff Japan, has been classified as the world\u2019s only\nimmortal organism, since it\ncan develop to adulthood,\nreproduce and then go\nbackwards in time to an\nearlier stage in its life cycle\nand start the whole process\nagain.\nThe trick up its sleeve is a\nprocess called transdiffer-entiation. When a human\ncell becomes highly specialised (or \u2018differentiated\u2019), it\nacquires useful properties\nbut cannot go back, nor\nbecome any other type of\ncell. For example, a skin\ncell can\u2019t change its mind\nand decide to become a\nstem cell or a heart cell.\nHowever, the immortal jellyfish has cells that are not\nbound by this restriction, so\ncells in the body of an old,\ninjured or stressed adult\ncan revert back to stem\ncells. These stem cells can\nthen develop to produce\nentirely new adults, effectively allowing the jellyfish\nto cheat death.\nCall it regeneration rather\nthan transdifferentiation\nand suddenly the idea of\nDr Who doesn\u2019t seem so\nfar fetched.\nThe Secret to\nImmortality\nRachel Gillepsie investigates why a low fibre diet can cause a myriad of\nhealth problems\nAnother one of Mr. Aran\nShaunak\u2019s Little Bites of\nScience\n\\\\ The lesson\nwe\u2019re learning\nfrom studying the\ninteractino of fibre,\ngut microbes and\nthe intestinal barrier\nsystem is if you don\u2019t\nfeed them, they can\neat you \\\\\n\\\\ Shane Anderson\n\\\\ Bounmy C\nLizzie Riach summarises a talk in the Royal Society\u2019s series \u2018Science Matters\u2019 on the direction of\nwhere artificial intelligence is heading, and why there\u2019s no need to be scared of it taking over\nthe world...yet.\nL\nast Wednesday\nI attended a talk\ncomprised of five\nleading experts in\nthe fields of machine\nlearning and artificial\nintelligence (AI), mediated\nby the calming voice of Brian\nCox. It was an enlightening\nevening. I hadn\u2019t really\nthought too much about AI,\nbut what struck me was how\nmuch of what I did know was\nbased on fiction films. What\nsoon became apparent was\nthat, obviously, we were no\nwhere near the likes of the\nhumanoid robot seen in Ex\nMachina, a film for which\none of the panellists, Murray\nShahanan, was the scientific\nadvisor. I mean, sure, a\nmachine had beaten the\nnumber one Go player in the\nworld, the last strategy game\nwhere humans, until now,\ncould not be beaten. But this\nspecific machine was built\nspecifically for playing Go. It\nhad no other functions outside\nthe realm of game-play \u2013 it\ncertainly wasn\u2019t going to take\nover the world.\nThe first question was: what\nexactly is the difference\nbetween machine learning\nand AI? The general\nconsensus was that machine\nlearning has a narrow\nfunction within the spectrum\nof AI. Machine learning is\nwhen an algorithm is given to\na computer, allowing it to use\ndata to learn its own solutions.\nThis is becoming extremely\nwidespread, it\u2019s used by\nFacebook to tag photos\nusing facial recognition \u2013\nthe more photos you tag of\na person, the more data the\nalgorithm gains to what this\nperson looks like. Similarly,\nSiri uses voice recognition to\nunderstand commands. These\nalgorithms decide what you\nmay like on Netflix or Spotify,\nand you also may notice that\nadverts on facebook tend\nto be customised to your\nlikes, searches, and events.\nIn my case, UV rave make\ndiagnoses than humans. So\nthis is machine learning, a\nfairly narrow part of AI, but\none that has garnered the\nmost attention in the past\nfew years. AI uses machine\nlearning, integrating it into a\nmore general framework to\nbecome \u2018intelligent\u2019 by doing\n\u2018the right thing at the right\nmoment\u2019 in an ever-changing\nworld.\nBut how do we keep track\nof what exactly AI is learning\nor doing? Even the experts\nconfessed that a lot of the\ntime, the most complex and\npowerful computers used\nfor machine learning give\nthem next to no information\non how they are doing it.\nThis is because within their\n\u2018black boxes\u2019, inspired by the\nneural networks of our own\nbrains, the algorithms get too\ncomplex to process. However,\nthe scientists reiterated that\nthe very architecture of\nthese machines limit them to\nundertake the tasks given to\nthem.\nSo what about the future?\nPredictions all pointed to\nmachine learning becoming\nextremely widespread, being\npresent behind the scenes,\nespecially in healthcare to\nhelping diagnose and treat\npatients, as well as public\nservices \u2013 looking at houses\nmostatriskoffireoryouthsmost\nat risk from abuse. Self-driving\ncars will be everywhere,\nand buildings designed by\nmachines to utilise minimal\ncost for maximum strength\nwill prove extremely helpful\nto engineers and architects.\nCrime patterns, financial\npredictions, pharmaceutical\ndrug synthesis, and genetic\nfingerprinting could all be\naided by AI. Speech interface\nbetween humans and devices\nwill be more equipped for\nhandling complex speech\nand questions. \u201cSo which\njobs are \u2018tech-proof\u2019?\u201d a\nup ads haunt my newsfeed \u2013\nperhaps a hint that I should\nstop clicking \u2018attending\u2019 to RA\nevents, and actually get on\nwith my Masters. The point is,\nmachine learning is constantly\nbecoming an integrated\nway to advertise, as well as\nbecoming a basic interface\nfor people and devices. The\nAmazon Echo and Alexa\nVoice service were among the\nbiggest Christmas bestsellers,\ndue to their voice recognition\ntechnology.\nThis can also be employed\nin healthcare. Identifying a\ncancer cell is one example. A\nmachine, at first, could scan\nan image of healthy cells and\ncancer cells. With no data\non either, the machine would\nsimply guess which one is\ncancerous. After a doctor\nverifies which one is which,\nthis data will be logged.\nThousands of choices later,\nthe machine will have found\npatterns based on why certain\ncells look cancerous, and in\ntime may make more concise\nArtificial Intelligence | fears and future\nconcerned audience member\nasked. Speakers stressed that\nalthough some jobs may be\nmade redundant when AI\ntakes over, for others, it will\nbe there to do menial boring\njobs, giving us more time to\ndo the fun and creative ones.\nJobs that are the \u2018most safe\u2019\nwere apparently those that\nretain the need for manual\ndexterity, such as a plumber\nor electrician, care-givers, as\nwell as those in the creative or\nentertainment sectors.\nOur very own Director of the\nAerial Robotics Laboratory,\nDr. Mirko Kovac, graced the\nstage at this point to talk about\nwhere drone technology\ncould be heading in the future.\nHe stated that using drones\nfor photography and delivery\nwere obvious applications,\nand that we should be thinking\nmore creatively about their\nwider uses. His bio-inspired\nideas centred around the\n\u2018Build Drone\u2019, which can attach\n\\\\ Machine learning\nwill be extremely\nwidespread in the\nfuture, working\nbehind the scenes in\na range of roles \\\\\nitself to pillars by building\n\u2018webs\u2019 when they\u2019re running\nout of power to fly. Once\nattached, they can recharge\nand sense its surrounding\nenvironment, similar to spiders\nwaiting for prey in their webs.\nBy drawing inspiration from\nanimal behaviours, Dr. Kovac\nand his laboratory have found\na way to allow their drones to\nact autonomously.\nThis talk cleared up my\nown unfounded prejudices\nagainst AI, and opened up\nthe possibilities it may hold\nin the future. Despite my\namazement though, I couldn\u2019t\nhelp but feel AI may begin\nto know our habits and living\npatterns better than we do.\nWho will have access to this\ninformation? The biggest\nglobal tech companies are\nonly going to grow in power\nwith this technology, I just hope\nit\u2019s in a positive direction.\n\\\\ Although some\njobs may be made\nredundant, for others\nAI may allow more\ntime to do creative\nand fun jobs by\ndoing the menial\ntasks for us \\\\\n\\\\ Using drones for\nphotography and\ndelivery are obvious\napplications, we\nshould be thinking\noutside the box \\\\\n\n"

I also read about\nN\news flash; Jeremy Corbyn\nemerged from his ferret\nhole in North London and\nmade a speech! He must\nhave read my article about\nhow he needed to get his\nact together and talk positively about\nimmigration. As if I were felix\u2019s de facto\nLabour immigration policy correspondent,\nI have returned to give a judgement on\nJC\u2019s words.\nThe summary is that despite wanting to\nremain in the single market, Corbyn is not\nopposed to ending freedom of movement,\nwhich he has claimed Labour \u201cis not\nwedded to\u201d. Somehow he has taken on\nlack of enthusiasm as a political stance.\nHe has compromised on his positivity\ntowards immigrants in order to appeal\nto working class voters who showed their\ndissatisfaction with the status quo at the\nballot box last year. The result is a point\nof view that is not particularly exciting \u2013\nmuch like his arguments for remaining in\nthe EU last June \u2013 but he seems to think\nthat the anti-establishment overtones will\ninvigorate the people. This remains to be\nseen.\nHe also pointed out the things about\nthe EU that he hopes Brexit will consign\nto the past \u2013 for example, state aid laws\nthat stop us helping the steel sector \u2013 but\nwe always knew he was not keen on the\nEuropean project. It is good he is still\ntalking about making changes in Labour\nlaws, in particular taking action against\nundercutting of pay and conditions, as\nthat is a more constructive approach to\neliminating immigration problems than\nclosing borders.\nIt\u2019s rather novel for immigration to be hot\non the lips of Labour politicians. MPs Emma\nReynolds and Stephen Kinnock were in\nthe news suggesting the introduction of\na two-tier immigration system, in which\nhighly skilled workers would be treated\ndifferently to low-skilled workers. This\nI\nn recent months, the \u2018Rhodes Must\nFall\u2019 campaign has gained significant\ntraction not only at Oriel college,\nOxford but at several institutions in\nthe UK and abroad. The campaign\nhas attempted to have the statue of\nCecil Rhodes removed due to his strong\nsupport for the apartheid movement in\nSouth Africa.\nThe campaign has had already had\nan impact at universities, with Queen\nMary\u2019s University, London having recently\nremoved a foundation stone laid down by\nKing Leopold II, a Belgian king associated\nwith colonialism and the forced labour\nand death of many people in what is now\nthe modern day Democratic Republic\nof the Congo. Many of those who have\njoined the campaign have not only riled\nagainst the statue of Cecil Rhodes as an\nindividual who supported apartheid but\nagainst colonialism, imperialism and their\nhistorical influences on British education.\nThe views of Cecil Rhodes are of course\nabhorrent and would find no home in a\nmodern civilized country but the issue of\nwhether it is right to remove his statue is\na very different prospect altogether. The\nremoval of his statue would be an attempt\nto re-write history and ameliorate those\nparts that make us uncomfortable.\nBut this is not what we should learn\nfrom history and the mistakes we have\nmade; we should be able to look on the\nCorbyn finally\nsaid something\nand I\u2019m not\nimpressed\npast honestly and learn its\nlessons whether these reflect\nnegatively on us or not.\nWe wouldn\u2019t dare consider removing statues of\nGandhi for all the great\nwork he did in liberating\nIndia and bringing about\nher freedom because of\nhis views on sexual assault\nand women\u2019s rights. Many\nhistorical figures have had\nviews which run counter\nto modern day values and\nthese statues stand as a\ntestament of how far we\nhave come as a society\nand how far we must go\nfurther to live in a truly just\nand equal society. It does\nthese figures an injustice\nto judge them by 21st\ncentury ideals and disregard\nthe context in which their\nviews were formed. Imperial College has a long\nand rich history, some of\nwhich is based in Imperialism. Our motto \u201cScientific\nknowledge, the crowning\nglory and the safeguard\nof the empire\u201d and one of\nour aims \u201cexploring and\ndeveloping the raw materials of the Empire countries\u201d\nhighlight these links but it\nwould be wholly inappropriate to attempt to change\nour motto as it is a part of\nImperial\u2019s history and is\ncrucial to the story of how\nour university became what\nit is today.\nsuggestions for a \u2018London visa\u2019\nin the Evening Standard, which\nsounded quite off the wall,\nbut at least it acknowledges\nthat metropolitan areas feel\ndifferently about immigration\ntotherest,andthatevenifmore\nborder controls are brought\nin, we should think about ways\nto help our successful firms\nemploy from the pool of talent\naround Europe and beyond.\nJeremy Corbyn has been\nleader of the party for over\na year, and only now has he\ncome up with a strategy. Well,\nbetter late than never. It seems\nlike a reaction to the threat\nposed to him by Paul Nuttall,\nnew leader of UKIP, who has\nhis eyes on Labour\u2019s Northern\nand Midlands heartlands. If\nhis tenure kicks Corbyn into\naction, maybe it will be a\ngood thing for all of us.\n\\\\ He seems to\nthink that the anti-establishment\novertones will\ninvigorate the\npeople. This remains\nto be seen \\\\\nSouthern Rail\nneed to get their\nshit together \\\\ I\u2019m certainly more\ncompetent and my main\nexperience is playing\nRailroad Tycoon \\\\\nTessa Davey just wants to be able to\ncommute for less than five hours a day\nT\nhere were train\nstrikes this week,\nyou might have\nheard. No, not the\ntube strikes, they\nhappen like once a\nyear; you can take a bus for\na day, get over yourself, no\none cares. I\u2019m talking about\nSouthern Rail, whose staff are\non strike for three days this\nweek, causing a genuine total\nshutdown of all services. strike since December, and\nthe conductors have been\nstriking periodically, meaning\nthat even when the trains are\nrunning, they\u2019re subject to\nhuge delays, cancellations,\nand general unreliability.\nAlthough the strikes can\nhardly take all the blame for\nthis: Southern were failing to\nprovide the trains that they\npromised long before the staff\nstopped showing up to work.\nDue to my general state of\npoverty as a past-the-end-of-funding PhD student, I\u2019m\ncurrently living in Croydon.\nIt should take me an hour\nto get to college, not much\nworse than living in Woodward, so not a problem.\nBut of course, this assumes\nthat Southern do their jobs.\nLast week, when there were\nno strikes, I spent a total of\neighteen hours commuting\nover four days. Five hours\na day travelling \u2013 and by\nthat I mean largely waiting\nat freezing cold stations for\na train that won\u2019t be cancelled at the last minute \u2013 is\nexhausting, and a waste of\nmy time.\nThere are alternatives,\nsure. It should still be\npossible to get into London,\nit might take a little longer.\nWhich is fine, in principle,\nbut in practice the additional\npressure on alternative services such as trams and\ntubes is so great that the\nstations offering these shut\ndown completely as a safety\nprecaution. I could take five\nbuses, taking around four\nhours if it goes smoothly,\nthen have to immediately\nturn around and start back\nhome as soon as I get into\ncollege. These aren\u2019t sustainable options.\nI understand why the staff\nare striking. I don\u2019t really\nblame them, it\u2019s shit for them\ntoo. I\u2019ve read enough think-pieces in the Guardian, I\nknow that they\u2019re miserable,\nand it\u2019s all for our safety, and\nthey\u2019re being forced to work\noutside their contracts and\naren\u2019t being compensated.\nSouthern is a shit company with apparently zero\n300,000 people, including\nme, commute into Victoria\neach morning using Southern\nRail, which, unsurprisingly,\nruns to the south of London,\nand provides essentially the\nonly travel links into central\nLondon. You\u2019d think that\npreventing \u2013 and I really do\nmean preventing \u2013 that many\npeople from getting to work\nwould make a point, job done,\nboom. But no, these three\ndays are three out of at least\nsix days without any service\nthis month, on top of many last\nyear. The train drivers have\nbeen on a permanent overtime\n\\\\ Southern Rail\nis a shit company\nwith apparently\nzero management\nstructure, who\ncouldn\u2019t organise\na piss up in a\nbrewery \\\\\nmanagement structure, who\ncouldn\u2019t organise a piss up\nin a brewery, let alone the\ntimely passage of hundreds\nof thousands of people, or,\nif that\u2019s too much to expect,\nat the very least update the\nexpected arrival times at\nthe stations. They say that\nthey\u2019re losing money, and\ncan\u2019t afford to employ the\nnumber of staff that they\nneed to maintain their time-table. They say that being a\ntrain company means running at a loss. Well tell that\nto every other rail company\noperating on National Rail\ntracks, coming in and out of\nNational Rail managed sta-tions. They\u2019re all managing\nto keep trains running and\nturn a profit \u2013 maybe ask\nthem for advice.\nOr if you\u2019re really running\nat that much of an unsustainable loss, give it up\nand hand back over to the\ngovernment so then at least\nsomeone accountable is in\ncharge.\nBut enough is enough. This\nis not public sector. Southern is a private company\nand there comes a point\nwhere it is not acceptable\nto inconvenience such a vast\nnumber of people because\nthey do not like the conditions of their job. Of course,\nSouthern, in releasing a\ntimetable and taking government transport grants,\nhas a responsibility to its\npassengers, particularly the\nones who spend a fortune\non season tickets. As much\nas the staff who choose to\n\\\\ There comes a\npoint where it is\nnot acceptable to\ninconvenience such\na vast number of\npeople because\nthey do not like the\nconditions of their\njob \\\\\nstay with Southern need to\naccept that their roles may\nchange slightly, Southern\nneeds to get its act together\nand do whatever it takes\nto provide the service it\npromises, or else hand over\nthe reins to Sadiq Khan or\nsomeone who\u2019ll do the job\nproperly. Or me, even. I\u2019m\ncertainly more competent\nand my main experience is\nplaying Railroad Tycoon.\nI hate Southern Rail as a\ncompany much more than I\nresent the staff that work for\nthem on the ground. They\u2019re\ntaking so much abuse from\nangry delayed passengers every single day, and\nthey\u2019re taking it with better\nhumour than they could possibly be asked to. Certainly\nthese strikes have brought\nout a sense of community\namongst fellow sufferers,\nand we all like the excuse to\nwrite sassy tweets. But we\u2019re\nbored now. The torture that\ncommuters are facing is\ncompletely disproportionate\nto the point that the unions\nare trying to make, and the\ndamage that this mess is\ncausing to the economy is\nobscene.\n\n"
