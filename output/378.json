This was a cl as sic case of extremes . The support had\nlooked as if their clothes were borrowed\nthird hand while Argent were dressed in\nthe most ultra modern effeminate gear they\ncould find.\nThe group were welcomed with eager\nenthusiasm that did not seem to die until\nthe final anticlimax that ended a performance that was notable for its excessive ness. The only other achievement worthy\nof note was Rod Argent' s virtuosity on\nkeyboards (he even plays with his feet\nand posterior.) They started off with an\ninteresting instrumental that is taken of\ntheir forthcoming album called 'Service'.\nWe were then treated to a couple of Argent\noldies one of which was'Music from the\nspears'\nCOMCKftT\nThe next song was' Trapeze', an arrangement, by Jim Rodford their bass guitar-ist,' of an old Indian piece called 'FAkir'.\nA well executed number and the last of\nthe concert for the mixer then took it into\nhis head to overload the-bass which tot-ally drowned out the other instruments\nexcept the drums.\nThe encore was a washout and the\ngroup did not reappear despite persistent\ncalls from the audience and so ended an other Saturday night concert at I.C. with\nEnts left to clear the mess up. One good\nthing about the whole affair is that it was a full house and Ents have made some profit\nout of it. One last point. Argent have two\nnew members, the lead guitarist John Grimaldi who is only 19 and the drummer,\nJohn Varity. The former has a lot of\npromise for the future.\nAKC0AD3 Ian Morse Paul Ek pen yong Billy Cobham: Spectrum (Atlantic)\n. BILLY COBHAM served a long apprenticeship as a session musician, playing\nwith artists from James Brown to Deodato,\nand then gained wider acceptance as the\ndriving force and timekeeper-extraordinary\nbehind John McLaughlin' s Mahavlshnu\nOrchestra. However, he Is now fronting\nhis own band, Spectrum, which appears to\nbe doing well In the States and has three\nfine albums to his credit, of which this Is\nthe first.\nMany jazz musicians these days are\nmaking their music more accessible by the\nIntroduction of more popular forms Into the\nbasically complex nature of jazz, and in\nevidence on this album, are brought\ntogether some of the heavier elements of\nrock, the classics In part, the Latin beat,\nand the funky, faultless drumming of\nCobham himself.\n'Spectrum' consists of large hunks of\n]az zy funk dotted with Ilghtnlng-quick\nsolos, and interspersed with various\nelectronic rare t les( possibly due to a cautious approach on a first solo album).\nCobham lays down' a sea of percussion\nthrough which moves the bass of Lee Sklar (a long way from 'Sweef Baby James')\nand the heart of the matter Is fired out by\nTommy Bolln on guitar and Jan Hammer\n(keyboards).\nCobham knows when to lay off the\nvolume, allowing the other musicians\nroom for movement and finesse, and\nyet as soon as a number begins to drag,\nthe beat and power return Immediately.\nThis Is class music from an artist\nconsidered by many as one of the finest\ndrummers In the business and shows a vast Improvement, due to the strength of\nthe compositions, or his work with John\nMcLaughlin. Ross: The Pit and The Pendulum\n(RSO 2394 1 44)\nROSS AREa five piece band built aro-British session guitarist Alan Ross who\nwrites and sings 90% of the material included on this album. This, their second\nrecord for R SO, is that strange bird the\n'Concept' album. Like so many bands be-before them they have managed to produce music and lyrics that have little or\nnothing in common with the original ' concept;' m this case Edgar Allan Poe' s classic. However, the music is very listenable,\npleasant songs, with some Ross himself\nsings well, not unlike Stevie Windwood\nand the band play with com pet ance, but\none has the impression the musk; lacks\nthat vital ingredient - originality.\nI would imagine Ross was put together with the American market specifically in mind, the employment of a conga player, the album being rec or ded in L.A., and the fact that the band\nwas chosen to support Eric Clapton on\nhis hugely successful tour last sum mer underlines this. . Yet while attempting to sound like our American cou sins in many ways, Ross retain a typically English accent to their music. As it \u2022 is they' ve succeeded in making an album that has that strange Mid Atlantic feeling wetness. Kool and The Gang: Rhyme Tyme\nPeople/Father, Father. (Polydor 2001\n558).\nTYPICAL K and the G street funk,\nthe sort of number that sounds fine on\na US. F/M station, but has little chance of making our insipid chart. The song shuffles along with the usual Gang drive, the band always aiming their music at the body rather than the\nmind, a fact underlined by the crass lyrics of the flipside \"but man flies\naround the moon, and sings a song\nthat begins with June, and eats his\nlunch at every noon - in harmony he\ndoes this\" ...Honest! .\nPARKING\nThe following people have\nbeen allocated parking\npermits for the rest of the\nsession.

Production Engineer\nMany thanks to Gill, Julia, Sue and Andrew\nCOPY DEADLINE\nMONDAY, 11.55 A.M. Imperial College,\n3rd February 1975.\nDear Sir,\nI should like to raise some\npoints in reply to the recent\nletter from Mr J. J.Al bre chu He claims that 'as a foreigner he is probably less pre jud iced'. What special qualifications does being a foreigner\nconfer upon a person to make\nhim,'/ess prejudiced'? - or is Mr. Albrecht merely showing\nhis prejudice?\nThe vast majority of people\nin this country have never\nexploited anyone - the people\nmaking the profits from the\nEmpire not being the British Workers . Why, therefore, do\nthey have to be ' responsible' for the millions of aliens allowed British Nationality under the\n1948 act? If these people have\ntheir own independent homeland\nthen they are presumably capable of taking care of themselves - but then I suppose that Mr.\nAlbrecht is so prejudiced as to\nbelieve that they should not be\ngranted the right to self-deter-mi nation. Mr. Albrecht seems to desire\nthe enforced integration of\npeoples of totally different\ncultures. This seems to be a particularly racialist and fas-c is t attitude. Why cannot people\nbe allowed to live in their own\nway, in their own land, without\nbeing forced to adopt customs\nthat are essentially alien to\nthem? As to the difficulties of\nlife in a multi-racial society we\nneed only glance briefly around\nthe world to see the misery and\nstrife arising from such societ-ies. For example, up to 2,000\npeople were killed in race riots\nin Malaysia during 1969 ;\n10,000,000 Ibos were slaughtered by the Nigerians in 1966;\n500,000 have been killed and\n115,000 made homeless in the\nstruggle for self-determination\nof the Negroes of Southern Sudan in their attempt to form a separate ' Republic of Az ania', etc.. Presumably these are\nonly 'minor' difficulties to the\nracialist Mr Albrecht.\nFinally, Mr Albrecht wonders where the NF stands over\nthe question of Europeans: the\npolicy is quite simple, they\nwill not be repatriated (but\nthose who wish to leave Britain\nmay, of course, do so quite\nfreely but we would allow no\nmore European immigration\n(except in certain special cas-es, e.g., refugees from the\nCommunist States.).\nYours Faithfully, A. J. Baczkowski\nN.F.S.A. at I.C.79 Stans fie Id Rd.\nBenflect,\nEssex.\nDear Sir,\nI am very grateful to you\nfor sending me FELIX every\nweek -1 find it very interesting reading. I was particularly\ninterested in the articles on\nstudent grants, and the agitation for an increase. 1 wonder\nwhat present day students\nspend their money on, and\nwhat they consider to be the\nreal essentials of life after all, a grant is meant to be for\nessentials, not luxe ries. Also I think it should be borne in mind that many parents pay a proportion of their offsprings'\ngrants, and any increase will come still harder on them,\nboth as parents and as taxpayers .\nWhen I was at I.C.( about\nthe time FELIX was born!) I had to cut down on food, make\nmy own clothes, and do with out anything that wasn't absolutely basic to existence.\nNevertheless, I had a very\ngood time.\nSo, what do today's students expr ect? Would any of\nthem like to publish, in\nFELIX, a detailed budget\n01-589 5111 Ext. 2166\n(bearing in mind that the grant\nis only intended to cover the\nthirty-odd weeks spent actually in College)?\nI do rather get the impression that students nowadays\nfeel that the world owes them\na living. This is not so;\nthey have yet to prove that\nthey have any worthwhile\ncontribution to make.\nYours faithfully,\nJoan M. Wells\n(nee Slow)\nB. Sc. A.R.C.S.(1949) Imperial College\n3rd February 1975\nSir,\ni was sickened to see the\nletter in \" FELIX\" from a National Front member. N.US. policy rightly calls for no platform for racists and fascists -by flouting this you are helping them in their efforts to gain\ncredibility.\nInt. 2881\nThe recent propaganda\ncampaign by the N.F. at I.C. is\nan insult to the thousands of\nforeign students and workers in\nthe College. If the N.F. had\ntheir way, these people would\nbe humiliated and driven from\nthe country. The prospect of an\nNF. government however is re-mote. Their real and immediate threat lies in their thug ger y against black people and\ntrade unionists of any skin col our. Black shop stewards in\nManchester have recently been\nslashed and beaten up by thugs\nbelieved to be members of the\nN.F., and the Front has been\nactive in breaking their strike.\nFascism appeals to the\nfrightened little man; if offers\nthe chance to feel power as\npart of a para-military organisation. Hence the emphasis on\nmarches with drums and Union Jack spears. Hence the plans\nof the NF. are to set up aL on don headquarters with dormitory\nContinued on page 9\n\n"

C. had a week of mixed\nfortune, losing 3 - 0 to Southa mp ton and winning 4 - 1\nagainst B.A.C Weybridge.\nAt Southampton I.C, forced\nto defend from the start, were\nunlucky to go one down to a scrambled goal midway through the first half. This score\nwas maintained until late in the\nsecond half when John Adolf Andrews (umpire) awarded a penalty flick because he felt\ncold. Roger Holson only just\ngot out of the way of this in time and with minutes left\nSouthampton went on to make\nit three.\nAfter the game I.C. lost a boat race to some specialists but reigned supreme at darts\nuntil Southampton, by now resplendent in yellow shirts\nprinted with the words WESSEX ANCHORS( Dr Spooner - please\nnote!) started throwing beer\nabout. At this point it was necessary to throw the main electricity switch and depart in dar*\nk ness.

Although conditions were ideal\nand both teams were ready and waiting by 2.15 the game could not\nbe played as the referee had failed to materialize. The two skippers eventually agreed to play\nthe match as a' league fixture\nwith a Kings College travelling\nreserve (actually their union\npresident) as the referee.\nWhat entailed was a hard\nand uncompromising match with\nsome very entertaining football\nplayed by both sides. In the\nfirst half Kings began with\nsome penetrating attacks and\nfinding our lads rather lethargic\ntook the initiative and stayed\nwell on top for the forty five\nminutes .After about 20 minutes\nthey scored their first goal\nwhen the two Ians failed to\nclear the ball from the six yard\narea in spite of 6 different\nopportunities to Head it away.\nShortly afterwards another error\nin our own half led to a Kings winger centre ing the ball and\ntheir centre forward hitting it\nperfectly on the volley to score\na great goal.\nHalf time saw us two goals\ndown, reflecting in a most ragged performance in the first\nhalf but determined to make\namends. And so we did. For the\nnext to minutes the ball hardly\ncame out of the Kings half as a rejuvenated I.C. attacked relent less ly. Fighting for every\nloose ball our forwards had the\nKings defence under constant\npressure and eventually it crack ed when the inevitable Glen Swaby hit one in from the edge\nof the area. We continued to\ndictate the play and about a quarter of an hour later a quick\ntouch throw from K. Seukiw\nfound S. Bates with plenty of\ntime to head pasts the groping\nhands of the keeper - a conn oi seus goal in every respect.\nThe remainder of the game\nwas a grim struggle to put\naway a winner which never\ncame but still provided a lot of\nthrills. Although we failed to conquer on the day, a repeat of that\nsecond half performance in the\nsemi final should see us through with no difficulty.\n\n"

I feel compelled to make the\nfacts known as I see them.\nDuring 1974, 1 worked for 3\nmonths on the factory floor of\nthe St. Albans Rubber Co.1 will be working there again\nthis Easter and summer.\nThe work-force (of about\n400) is about a quarter Bengali, the remaining three-quarters bei ng\" British\". Contrary to what\nthe NF says about immigrants\ntaking jobs away from British people, there is a labour shortage there. I was not aware of\nany ras c is m on the part of the\nfull-time workers.

It might surprise you\nto know that I myself did not\nexpect to be approached to\nstand for this post. However, I found that both within the\nBroad Left and outside of it\nthere was a great deal of pressure on me to put my name for-ward.

You know my attitude in respect of my work for the wi der student organisations such\nas ULU.I believe that the most\nimportant problems which students face today, such as\ngrants and education cuts, are\nnot problems which can be\nsolved by individual colleges but only by a united fight by\nthe mass of students. It is\ntherefore incumbent upon student leaders who are truly committed to working in the interests of their members to help in\nthe development of organ is at+ \u2022\nions that can generate that\nunity and fight on the wider\nquestions. It is in this perspective I see the work that I do\nfor UL U. Let me make it clear that\nthat work has never taken priority over my duty of IC stud-ents. I conduct thses duties in the time that other people will normally reserve for relaxation,\nbut I regard it not just as a separate set of duties but as part\nof my responsibility to those\nwho elected me.\nIt should also be made clear\nthat up until now I have not\ntaka i any public position on\nthe question of the FELIX Editor, though my views are\nknown within the executive .\nMy own activities in no way\ninfluenced my opinion on that\nmatter.

Oh, I know he hammed up some boring story in an attempt to make\nhis cancellation of the meeting\nsound, logical and sensible (it\ndidn't) but anyone who saw him\nposing at Me chEng pretending\nto be representing the views of\nI.C. could be forgiven for wish ing that the National Front\nwould take over for just long enough to place him in the hold of the first banana boat for\nJamaica. Yours furiously\nAlex Jeffries\nImperial College Union\n3rd February 1975\nDear Sir,\nIt's nice to see somebody\nsufficiently concerned about\nEnts to write to FELIX, even\nif the criticism in this case\nwas uninformed and unjustified.\nMore criticism would help us to\nimprove the entertainment we\nprovide, so we invite anyone\nwho has any suggestions to\ncome and see us in the Union Office any lunchtime.\nI'd better say some fairly\nobvious things about die way\nwe work: firstly, the size of\nbands we can put on. If we put\non small bands, we compete\nwith a multitude of small venues in London, and experience\nhas shown we loose money .And\nobviously we cannot put on the\nsupergroups, because the Great\nHall is too small. This effect-iv ely limits us to bands in the\n\u00a3400 - \u00a31100 range.\nSecondly, the way we book\nbands. We book through the Bro\nBron Agency. This means that\nwe are backed up by a lot of\nprofessional expertise and knowledge when negotiating for\nbands, which in practice makes\nit possible to get a lot more\nbands than we would otherwise\nbe able to.\nThirdly, how we choose\nbands. When we have free dates\nour chairman, Malcolm, asks for\nsuggestions at our weekly committee meetings, and takes the\nlist( which regularly includes\nall those bands Mr Stevenson\nsuggests) to Bron, and Bron tell us what is available, and\nnegotiate the contract with the\ngroup's agent.\nThis should give some idea\nof the constraints we work und-er, and make it apparent that it\nis not a simple matter of approaching a band to book it. To answer some of the individual points in Mr Stevens on' s letter. Booking ChapmanWhitney, Mike Heron and die\nH. M.K., all new acts, and\nSweet, was adventurous, while booking staid and tired Fair port (who played here last year\nand before, du mmo), and 10c,c. would definitely not be. Hatf ie ld and the North do not look\nto be an economic proposition.\nlOc. c are too big, preferring to\nplay larger halls. Any more\nsuggestions, A P.?As for us not having enough\nvariety, I think a line up rang-ing from Thin Lizzy to Tom Paxton, and from Leo Saizer to\nBarclay James Harvest is quite\nvaried, to say the least,\nWe want to put on three big conceits at the beginning of the\nSummer term, before exams\nstart. Now is your chance to\ncome and tell us what you want.\nYours sincerely, Andy Hi groan\nOn behalf of the\nEnts Committee \u2022\nSOCIALIST SOCIETY\nMEETING\nAnn Scott\" Spare Rib\" Magazine\non ' WOMEN'S LIBERATION' Thur s.20 th Feb. l JOO Union Senior Common Room\n(1st Floor) Blue \u2022 Book/ Diary(?)

    "content": "6 FELIX\ninterview by Ri zSh a kir The Chairmen of the ICP GG is an affable, intelligent man of\nslim build with a rather characteristic beard. I met him in the\nlounge bar (now the in scene for FELIX interviews) where after\na false start or two we were able to proceed with putting the\nfocus on Tom Abraham.\nTom was born in India\nwhere he lived for two years\nand then subsequently lived\nin Ethiopia, Ghana and currently England where he has\nbeen receiving his graduate\neducation. He obtained his first degree in Electrical Engineering at Surrey and is in\nhis final year at IC as a research student. His subject\nof inquiry is electrical mater-i al s.He likes the life at IC\nthough he feels that \" the\nsocial life here is made a mockery of by We male and\nfemale ratio which is rather\nunfortunate \" He also feels\nthat the clique ya tinos hp ere that ' is a. bit worse here than\nelsewhere ..\" is not one of\nthe better aspects of IC life. When I asked him about his job as the PGA O he was at\non Tom Abraham\nedited by Paul Ek pen yong pains to stress that he saw\nhimself more as being the\nChairman of ICP GG than the\nPGA O which he feels has too\nmany limitations .In his role\nas Chairman of the ICP GG he\nwould \"like to be seen more\nas a spokesman tor a sector of\nhigher education at IC\" .\nThere are three main aspects to his job which are demonstrating (tutoring), a cade mic, and sitting on the PG Committee. On the fir,?, he is\ntrying to negotiate for reasonable rates of pay and proper\nconditions to work in .\n\"The second aspect is the-academic one, that is, as tar\nas research is concerned trying to safeguard the interests\nof PGs in that a lot of PGs\nend up doing projects which\nare none starters . .Unfortun-at ely I do not think that either\nthe College or the individual\ndepartments seem to appreciate the extent of the pro b lem...\".\nThe third aspect involves\norganising socials, meetings,\ndiscussions and urging P GsI. CU and UL UP G group. The\nI CHOO as an ui yano ed UuCiy\nis now on a more sound footing he says,\"/ have been\npleasantly sup rise d by the\namount of interest that has\nbeen shown in the group\".\nThis has meant more success with socials they have organised and progress on a research charter which will detail\nthe responsibilities of students and super vis qrs/ 'Trie\npossibility ol a\" 'thesis grant\"\nis also one of our main aims\nand we have received encouraging signs from tii e research\ncouncils concerned\" .\nHe hopes that by the time\nhis term of office comes to an\nend the PGA O will bf; a member of the executive though\nthe RSMU vote was a setback.\nHis last comment was\"/ would like to retire to Jamaica\" .\nThe wheel turns\nfull circle\nTony Jones\nTHERE ARE not many people who can get 400. people into a250 seat lecture theatre and keep them there for two hours. But\none such man is Eric Laithwaite, and he proved it last week at\na talk presented by the RCS Mathematical and Physical Society\nIf the talk;was late starting it was only because the Professor\nhimself was trapped in the\ncrowds jamming the portals of\nPhysics Theatre 1, and experienced great difficulty in getting in to see hrs own lecture.\nBut when at last he emerged in to the limelight the thunderous\napplause with which he was\ngreeted amply confirmed the\nenormous prestige of \"our\nEric\".\nBut why should 400 people\nwant to see a lecture entitled\n\"The Multiplication of Bananas\nby Umbrellas\"? Perhaps bec a use they know that when Eric Laithwaite talks of bananas and\numbrellas he really means gyroscopes or linear motors, either\noi wm cn is aou e for lots of\nfun and defying of authority.\nBut this time of course, it was\ngyroscopes .The man who took\non the full weight of the Establishment, shocked the Royal\nInstitution, confounded the\npundits and delighted hundreds\nof children, had come home to\ntell his flock all about his adventures.\nThe seem in ly bizarre behaviour of gyroscopes has always\nproved to be a rich source of\namusement and a cause of much\nracking of brains. No doubt with\nthis in mind Professor Laith waite opened his talk by demonstrating that a spinning\ngyroscope tends to keep its axis fixed in space. But fixed relative to what? Is there\nabsolute space? Or as the Prof,\nputs it, \"What is it pointing\nat?\"\nBut there was no time to\ndwell on the implications of\nthis question as the Prof,\nlaunched into his analogy between gyroscopic motion and\nelectromagnetiSm. With impart-ur b able confidence he breezed\nhis way through the demonstrations and concluded defiantly\nthat there is no angular momentum or central force associated\nwith the precession al motion\nof a gyroscope. Not content\nwith knocking the wind out of\nthe Physics Oenartment, he proceeded to similarly confound\nMaths by triumphantly scribbling the calculations leading to\nthe famous \"Third Derivative\"\nLaithwaite joyfully twirling his gyroscope.\nor \"surge\" and declaring the\npossibility of the existence of\n\"complex mass\" with a property very similar to induct-ance. In a world where energy\nand action divorce themselves\nfrom momentum and reaction,\nperhaps it was too much to\nexpect Professor Laithwaite to\nresist rewriting the laws of\nNature; and so he did. With\ncomplex mass, Newton's Second\nLaw becomes\nF(m+ i Aw)a With A being the \"induct-ance\", and w the angular\nvelocity of a rotating object.\nIf the equation looks familiar,\nit's supposed to .Professor\nLaithwaite would be the first\nto point out that the resemblance to emf = (RiL W) l is not mere coincidence.\nNo-one who sat in Physics Theatre 1 that afternoon could\nhave failed to be impressed,\nwhether by the nerve of the\nman, the implications for\nscience or by the sight of the\nProf standing on the front\nbench breaking every safety\nrule by whirling a24 pound\nContinued on page?\n\n"

Nevertheless, we dec i ded to brave these setbacks\nand play three games short of\nplayers. Meanwhile in OB2 the\nvirus was being reared by Denso and Tapper at the optimum\ntemperature of 3 5 oc. Inside\nthe sive at y head of the former\nwas stored the information that\nBob( Ir early scored a hot trick)\nAustin was turning up at the\nKingston ground. The detailed\ninstruction to the ground lay\nunder a heap of aspirin bottles.\nWe event aul ly arrived at the\nKingston ground to be shown to\nthe chicken run to change. A frantic rush to secure their own\npersonal nail was made by the\nI.C. players. BoBo roosted in the rafters.\nThe I. C.1st XV started one\nplayer short but the balance\nwas redressed within five minutes when one of the Kinston player retired to receive ten\nstitches in a leg. During this\nfirst half the one in two slope\nproved to be of some advantage\nto I.C. and within the first quarter we ran up 13 points with a Hughes penalty and conversion\nand tries by Austin and Fear n. It was now obvious to all that\nthere was no need to do any\nmore to win the match so tea\nand biscuits were served for the\nrest of the half.\nNow playing up the slope\nI.C. found the going much\ntougher. Lip ps had to tighten\nthe string in his shorts to prevent his pot dragging along the\nfloor and Donkey was seen to\nstreak up the wing on his pongo\nstick. Kingston fought well driving I.C. back and had soon\n'reduced the I.C. lead with a well converted penalty goal.\nThis pattern continued till fifteen minutes from the end\nwhen all tea trolleys were cleaned and I.C. started to play\nagain. Several excellent forward rushes followed by quick\npossession were not rewarded\nwith tries but by this time I.C. had had their fourth try d is all owed. It was left to BoBo to run\nseventy yards to break the dead-lock. This was followed by a Hughes try which came from a fifty yard run by Zappa. The final score was 21 - 3 to I.C. Team D.

The tube journey to East Hounslow was peaceful enough with Mike and Janet doing the crossword together and Mark\nlooking on jealously . A short walk to the bus station and we were\non the way to the ground. Having nearly got off at the wrong\nstop we got out by the Queen's Head. On observing th his building\nthe umpire made straight for the\nbar muttering. \" ES B for break-fast.\" A cry from the captain/ secretary/organiser of the mixed hockey club caused a halt\nbut after a democratic vote the\nnumber of customers swelled by\ntwelve. We at last arrived at the\ngro.und only to find no opp osi tion. They eve tu ally turned up\nand we began twenty minutes\nlate. Playing uphill IC began\nwell but after a while Speedbird\nbegan to come into it. Despite their steady pressure they cou-ld n't beat Chris Parker or Pete Nowell and when they did Shirley \" hit it anywhere\" Fair we a ther and John Huck le cleared up\nconfidently leaving the stray bel isha beacon in goal with very\nlittle to do.\nSuddenly, in the 28th minute,\nthe ball was smashed out of defence and ended up with Dave\nBalderson who put it into the\nnet, Silverbird replied by crashing a shot against the inside\nof the post but luck was with\nIC and it stayed out.\nIC began the second half\nconfidently with Pete, Janet and Lindsay working well on the\nright but as in the first half Speedbird gradually came back\nbi it the defence held firm. Then\nin the 62nd minute Chris Parker\npicked up a ball in midfield and dribbled through to score a fine\ngoal. This was followed four\nminutes later by a goal from\nMike\" I've ruptured myself' Vie yr a with help from Di.

On the coach, it was discovered that we were minus two\nplayers (Pete Nowetl and Chas Hardy). Our esteemed (?) captain solved this problem by pre-s sing the umpire (yours truly)\ninto service and replacing him\nin his habitual role of full-back.\nOur victims, the Potters Bar XI, were obviously the lesser\nteam. This was borne out by the\nfact that our first goal was scored in two minutes! From the\nbully-off, the ball was taken up\nright wing, A superb cross\nfound our unmarked lef* winger,\nClive Thomson, just inside the\n' D'. The latter coolly hammered the ball home. A few minutes\nlater, our captain Ian Read,\nrecovered from his hangover\nlong enough to score our second goal in a similar style.\nPotters Bar managed to\nforce a short corner from which\nthey scored. The third goal was\nscored by Dave Balderson and Clive Thomson got his second\ngoal just before half-time.\nIn the second half, Potters\nBar, hopelessly outclassed yet\nagain, conceded another two\n?;o als. The first of these arose\nrom a penalty stroke, ably\ntaken by Bob Middle*)n. He then scored his second and our\nsixth goal.\nThe whole team played extremely well. The game was\nenjoyed by all although the\nfull-backs and goalkeeper did not see much of the ball. The only regrets we had were that\nneither Clive nor Bob scored a\" jug\". Our thanks must go to Mr\nJerry Jacobs for his efficient\numpiring of the match.\nTeam: N. Harrison, J. Huckle, P. Nair, A. Turner, C. Parker, Y. Tan, D Balderson, J. Brownridge, R Middle ton.

However,\nI cannot escape the feeling that\npeople, both those with power and\nthose without it, are fi sidling while\nRome is burning. The complacency\nof some people involved in education\ntoday, students, staff, and bureau-crats, is absolutely staggering.\nLast Friday, I went along to the\nInner London Education Authority, for a meeting with the leader of the ILEA, to\ndiscuss the effects of the ILE A'S act ions in London. You will remember\nreading that we are specifically affected by the withdrawal of the\n\u00a3270,000 ILEA grant from the university\nof London. The ILEA is in the process\nof cutting back on its education services\nin London: colleges closed or merged,\ncourses dropped, students lost, etc. Part-time schooling and classes of 4 5\nhave been the norm for many school\nchildren, for some time.\nYet the representatives of the\nILEA had the nerve to sit and say\nthat the education services in London were actually improving! When\nI suggested that they should tell\nthat to the schoolchildren, their\nteachers, or the students who were\nbeing chopped, they wrung their\nhands in horror that I should be so\nuncouth as to suggest that they\nworry about mundane matters\nmatters like that.\nThe ILEA is known for its progress ive ness( as some of my colleagues\non the deputation, which included representatives of the teachers lecturers,\nand the TUC General Council kept on\nsaying) If this is the way that they are\nregarding the crisis in education, in a situation where their own services are\nnear to breakdown, how is the far-from-progressive DES regarding it? I shudder to think. As far as1 am concerned\nsome of these people need a good swift\nkick to shake them out of their complacency - like many of our own\nstudents.\nOne of the by-products of last week's\"NF\" episode was something that the\nUnion has been searching for for some\ntime - the beginnings of genuine links\nwith the other Unions on campus. In the\npast, there have been attempts to form\njoint committees of one kind or another,\nfor various abstract reasons . However,\na a I have stated on many occasions, in\nthe present economic situation, with the\neducation system under heavy attack, the\nmajor prerequisite for effective defence\nagainst that attack is the unity of all those who are about to come under the\nhammer.\nWe often speak of joining wit th organised labour, cooperating with campus\nunions and so on, as far as I am c once r ned, we must never degenerate to the\nlevel where we are simply regurgitating\ntrendy idealogical rhetoric. Given the\nimage created for the student by the\nmass media, of the bol shy, doped - up\nfreaked - out, idle, anarchist, it is little wonder that many people are un-sympathetic, or even hostile to students.\nI have found, however, that the\npeople who actually work with\nstudents, who know our circumstances and environment, have a totally\ndifferent, and truer perception of us.\nFor that reason, when we speak of\ngaining public support for our cam-pa ign s, it seems clear that it is the\npeople who are closest to us that we\nshould approach first. And the way\nthat we have to do that is through\nour respective representative bodies\n- i.e. the unions.\nTo return to my original points, in\nthe campaign against education cuts, unity is of utmost importance. The jobs\nof the staff exist because of the stu dents; the cuts mean fewer students\nand fewer facilities, and therefore, fewer jobs. It is in the interest of the\npeople who work for the College, at all levels, to support the campaign against\ncuts in any meaningful way that they\ncan.* I was gratified to read that someone\nthinks that the page 3 pictures of girls\nin FELIX is pointless. I agree; further\nthan I think that it is in poor taste to\nparallel the features of the Daily Mirror\nand The Sun. These papers may sell a lot of copies; but it seems to me that\nI.C. students deserve a bit more credit\nto their intelligence and taste, than to\nhave their own paper pushing out sexist\nclaptrap.\nIn International Women's Year, it\nis particularly inappropriate to present women as mere camera - f odd er. It does nothing to enhance their\nstatus as serious, \"thinking\"\npeople .\n\u00bb\nI have nomination ro rms for the\nPresidency and Deputy Presidency of\nUL U in my possession; anyone who\nwishes to stand for either post can get\na form from me.\nI need help in the pu D li city and organisation for the Week of Action and the\ndemo on FRIDAY, FEBRUARY28 th. Anyone who can help, please let me\nhave your name in the Union Office.\nGRANTS/ CUTS\nDiscretionary awards\nA FULL GRANT FOR ALL STUDENTS\nSUPPORT THE LOBBY\nOF THE ILEA ON TUESDAY 25TH FEBRUARY\nThe discretionary award student lies on the other side of the \"binary syst-ems\". There is no obligation on the local authority to pay the whole of a stu-dent's grant or even any part of it. The most immediate example of the discretionary award is the postgraduate .\nThe award of aPG grant is not automatic np on the student being accepted on to\nthe course. With the SRC cat ting back on their number of awards in science and\nengineering, the picture now looks bleak.\nOne of the major claims of the campaign is an end to discretionary awards.\nThat means an end to prospective PG' s desperately rn shing around in order to\nfind a grant.\nGet rid of the discretionary award once and for all.\nOverseas students\nWhat are the major problems that overseas students face?\n/. Higher fees - over \u00a3250 compared with nearly \u00a390 for the \"home\" student.\n2. The IL&A has just increased these fees by 20%.\n3 .Overseas students are not allowed to work during vacations.\n4. Discrimination by landlords who charge a higher rate of hostel fees for\noverseas students.\nThus the system is essentially designed to ensure that only wealthy students study in -Britain.\nEnd this discrimination - parity for overseas students.\nNATIONAL DEMO\nON FRIDAY FEB 28TH "

This question is\nbeing asked in earnest following Wednesday's General Meeting\nat which including an action group in the constitution was prop-o sed.A number of Icwarians\nhave formed a group called 'Vtomen in Science' which\nclaims that as it stands\nICWA does not cater enough\nfor the needs of women in\ncollege, or at all fro some.\nThey suggest much more\nshould be done to e levi ate the\nproblems, both social and academic facing women in college. This idea has caused some\ndissent within the ranks of\nICWA. Although most agree\nthat there is room for an extension of IC WA's activities there are doubts about what\nthis would mean with regard\nto the future nature of I CW A. Could ICWA become a totally\npolitical organisation? Al though this seems unlikely a lenght y discussion is now in progress as certain members\nfeel ICWA is, and should re-main, a mainly social body.\nWhatever the outcome it will greatly be influenced by the results of the elections\nfor next years ICWA executive\nwhich will shortly take place.

    "content": "FELIX3 AFFAIRS CORNER\nTom Abraham\nTHE POSSIBILITY of a research charter for postgraduate\nstudents, has been discussed by the PG group committee. The\ngeneral feeling was that while it was a good idea, the implications of such a proposal would have to be examined in detail. At present there is aC.V. C.P. study group looking into all aspects of postgraduate education So far they have not bothered to ask for submission from\nany postgraduate groups. However, it is hoped that they will eventually show some interest\nin our views on the various\nissues. The L.S. O.ULU postgraduate sector is holding a meeting to draw up a London\npostgraduate submission to this\nStudy Group. This could provide\nthe forum for discussion on the\nresearch charter. Any proposals\nthat might come up will be presented at the next meeting of\nthe IC and GG. The Civil Engineering post-grads held a meeting to form a post grad group last Tuesday .\nAbout forty students turned up\nand the response when it came\nto forming a committee con THIS NUBILE young lovely is Henrietta, a real stunner from Manchester, who is\nstudying as a third - year\nMetallurgist. She says she\nfinds her equipment \"a little\nem baras sing.\" Her hobbies\ninclude playing with pistols\nand looking for a good underarm razor.\nWhat does she think of\nFELIX printing pictures of\ngirls on page three? \"I agree\nw iv Twev Phillips that page\nf wee is sexist clap t wap\". Oooohl\nPS. Thanks to Angela for the\nnightie.\nPP S. Howard has promised\nnever to do this again.\nTHUR S.20 TH SPM CONCERT HALL BLUE MOVIE3 Q STRIPPER P DRAG ARTISTE ANNOUNCEMENT\nThe Editor of FELIX would like to apologise to Gill\nMcConway, Anne Nolan and Robin for the inconvenience\nand the hassles that arose during the production of this\nedition of FELIX.\" I am entirely responsible for what\nhappened\" - Mike Williams.\nsi sting of representatives\nfrom each section, was very\nencouraging. At this meeting\nit was noted that postgraduate\nrepresentation on staff student\ncommittees was totally inadequate. In fact while departments\nare eager to listen to undergraduate opinion, they seem to ig nore postgraduate opinion. With\nso many departmental PG groups\nin existence, now is the time to\npress for more effective representation. On the subject of the postgraduate group, we at Imperial\nhave one of the most active\ngroups in the country. Compared\nto the other London colleges,\nwe are in a class of our own. The structure of the postgraduate group is such that we\nhave very effective contact with\ngrassroots opinion. This is a major achievement considering\nthat postgraduates are among\nthe most difficult of groups to\norganise . The people who deserve the credit for this, are the\nvarious departmental represent-at ives. As mandated by the I.C. postgraduate group, I have been\nlooking into ways and means of\nobtaining special 'thesis grants'\n(to cover the full costs of writing up). A letter requesting \u2022\nsuch a grant was sent to the\nchairmen of the S RC, NER C,AR C and SSR C. So far I have\nhad one reply - from the S RC chairman. The gist of the letter\nwas that the S RC was basically sympathetic to our case, and\nwill convey our views to the\ngovernment grant review panel\nwhen it next meets, sometime\nlatter this year. In my letter I had mentioned a figure of \u00a3100\nas being the average cost. Some\ndoubt was expressed about this\nfigure and I was told that it\nwould be helpful if some authenticated average bills could be\nprovided. I would therefore be\ngrateful if anybody who has\nsome bills could send them to\nme c/o Union office). My personal feeling is that we have a fairly strong case, and in spite\nof the adverse economic c lim ate, may get some cost of 'thes-is grant'.\nFinally, I talked about the\n' loving capacity ot postgraduates in my last PiG Affairs\nCorner. There seems to be\nenormous interest among the\nI.C. girls, who seemed on the\nwhole to agree with my views. However, their main complaint\nwas that they rarely ever see\nany real specimens of \"homo\nsapiens sapiens\" ie Postgraduates. So all you PG' s, now is\nyour chance! Get out there and start loving!!\n\n"

    "content": "mix7 THE NEW Theta. completed\njust in time for its debut at\nlas l night's Theta Dinner,\nweighs an incredible 105 lbs.\nThe solid stainless steel\nbase and the lead-loaded shaft\nwill put an end to the traditional heaving of Theta above\nthe President's head during\na Kangela. A quivering Pete\nTeague managed to hold it in\ndie horizontal position for only\na lew seconds during the demonstration for FF. LIX. A slow\nKang'ela would surely defeat\nanyone's muscular prowess.\nWhat your VOTE means.\nThere are a lot of elections taking place this term, all using the STV( single transferable vote) system. This admittedly is rather complicated but I will try to explain\nwhat effect you will have by voting in different ways.\nThe first choice you have is whether or not you fill in a voting paper. If you do not, you obviously have no influence on the results of the election except that if less than\n'\u20224 of the Full Members of the Union vote in the election\nfor President, Honorary Secretary, Deputy President or\nEditor the election is invalid. Assuming you do fill in a paper, you have a choice between voting and abstaining.\nIf you abstain it means that you either have no confidence\nin any of the candidates, or you do not feel you have\nenough knowledge of any of the candidates to express any\npreference,,\nAn abstention counts towards the '25% threshold' but will not alter the result in any way.\nAssuming now that you have a preference you have to fill\nin the paper properly and not ' spoil' it . This means that\nthere must be a figure ' 1 ' against the name of one, and\nonly one candidate. Further numbers can be written, but no\nnumber can be left out or used twice. You must not mark\nyour paper with an ' X'.F. Blog gs A.Nother1 A.N.Other J. Smith2 VALID\nF. Blog gs3 A.Nother1 A.N.Other2 J. Smith1 INVALID\nF. Blog gs2 A.Nother4 A.N.Other1 J. Smith3 VALID\nF. Blog gs3 A.Nother A.N.Other1 J. Smith INVALID\nIf you only mark your paper with aT and no other numbers\nit means you have given marks to one candidate and none\nto any of the others .\nSo if there is one candidate you specifically do not want\nelected it is best to put no number against his name. If you\nfeel, however, that you have some preference amongst the\nother candidates, having put a'1' against the name of your\nfirst preference, mak r'2','3', etc., against their name.\nI hope this has made some sense to you, and clarified to\nyou what power your vote has. If you have any further\nqueries do not hesitate to come and see me.\nJ. A. GERRARD BLACK MENACE\nagainst\nFASCIST BOGEY\nCharlie Wrigley\nIt is not often I put pen to paper , but in the last edition of\nFELIX( no. 377) there was a lot of matter which provokes com\nment. The political scene at College seems to have turned to\nnear hysteria by the sudden appearence of the National Front,\nand the anno uncia rion of Trevor Phillips' candidature in the .\ncoming NUS elections, not to\nmention their recent entangle-ment s. It's perfect: black\nmenace versus fascist bogey:\nthe plot sets sweeter than\n\" We sf Side Story\" .\nBut in its enormity, the enactment is grotesque, in that\nthis affair has to be resolved\nby the \"because its good for\nyou\" smack across the head\nprinciple and 900 I.C. Students can't be wrong syndrome .\nI take, for example the reporting (not just by FELIX) of \"Red Lion Thursday\" at\nI.C. when it was said police\nwere present to prevent National Front members from going into Mech. Eng., and then\nwas further said open meeting\nwas held in room 342 of that\nbuilding, \"no-one being denied entry.\" A somewhat cal van is tic view of pre destin a tion? But this is the great\nanomaly the NUS slams down\nin front of us: believe in freedom of speech as a fund a* mental right on the one hand,\nwhilst denying a platform for\nfascists and racists on the\nother.\nTo anyone suggesting I support the National Front,\nmy reply is rur t ly negative.\nBut the point is, labels are toe\neasily applied to people who\ndeviate from the norms set\ndown by groups in society.\nConfrontation will never produce solutions, or com prom i ses,only a total victory for\none side. But is this the result which we are urged to\nstruggle for? People ask for\ndemocractic rights but if you\nare not a member of the maj-or it y, democracy is as oppressive a dictatorship .Even the\nmajority have to confide in\nContinued from page 6\nwheel around his head.\nI don't know if he is\nright or not, but there is no\ndoubt that the possibility of\nin est i al drive will continue to\nfeed the fires of controversy\nfor a long time to come. At the\nmoment Eric Lailhwaite must\nfeel rather like the man who\ninvented the wheel, but perhaps\nin a thousand years tourists\nwill be flocking to see the tombstone en scribe d: \"To Hell with a place to\nstand; give me a wheel\nand I will move the Earth\"\ntheir elected peers, but both\nhave to accept their restrictions and impositions . Since democracy is our choice.\nI hope this can lead my\nprose to its conclusion, because also in the last edition\nof FELIX it was reported that\nat the Union Meeting the NUS\nAND THE National Front did\nconcur on something: namely\ntheir respective official viewpoints on the Common Market.\nIn those times when absurdity\nis the vogue, it is amazing the word offical and its connotations should not be more\nvisible. Individuals have to\nmake choices, one hopes without hard instinct, and certainly not with the amazing tinned,\nargument of dou be talk that too\noften appears. \"Whiter th;\nwhite washing powder doe ,\nnot work tor grey shirts .''\nMy dictionary defines fas-c is m as \"representing a nationalist reaction against socialism and communism\". Replace the words nationalism,\nSocialism and communism by\nvariables, say, x,y and z and\nyou have a formula for any\npolitical movement. There are\nmany reasons for a person to\nswitch one pole to another\nextreme . One of our current\npresident's favourite terms\n,last year was opportunism^\nMaybe, but beliefs are entirely personal and whatever the\nreasons for holding them hi story provides ample examples\nof ritual slaughter of those\nwho decline to conform .\nSaints and sinners alike are\nformed, but together they are\ndashed on the rocks below the\ncliffs of an uncertain comp-lace n cy. CONGRATULATIONS!\nFELIX offers its sincere\ncongratulations to Ron\nAppleby today, his Wed'\nding Day. We feel sure\nthat FELIX readers will\nforgive him for devoting\nhis energies to activities\nother than 'Stanley' next\nweek.\nFOLK CLUB presents\nCHRIS ROH MANN on Wednesday, Feb. 19th in the Union Lower Refec.\nat 7-30p.m. "
