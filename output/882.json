    "content": "Abortion in Ireland\nThis week was 'Week of Action' in\nIreland for freedom of information and\nwomen's right to abortion. Imperial\nCollege Union has been asked to set up a solidarity campaign with the Irish\nuniversities and colleges in their fight\nagainst this issue.\nIreland is the only EC country where it\nis illegal for a person to 'perform, attempt\nor assist in an abortion'. In Ireland\nabortion is still an offence punishable by\n'penal servitude for life'. And now, since\n1985, it is illegal even to give information\non abortion.\nHowever, the student unions in Ireland\nhave continued to openly give\ninformation about abortion in England for\nIrish women. In 1988 4,000 women registered with British abortion clinics as\nIrish nationals but it is believed that the\nsame number again refused to reveal\ntheir Irish addresses. At present, student\nunions in Ireland believe that there is a need to provide abortion information but\nthey are facing increasing pressure from\nall sides.\nIn 1988 SP UC( The Society for the\nProtection of the Unborn Child) took legal\naction against the four elected student\nunion officers of University College\nDublin. SPUC got an injunction\npreventing them from giving information\nabout abortion in England. The university\nofficers also became liable for nearly\n\u00a350,000 court costs and, since under Irish\nlaw, student unions have no legal status\nthe officers are personally liable for this\nmoney. In 1989 the same thing happened\nwhen SPUC took fourteen new student\nleaders to court and as a result they are\nagain personally liable for further costs of\n\u00a322,000.\nIf you believe that the Irish student\nunions should be helped and supported\nby British student unions in their efforts\nto provide abortion information then you\ncan personally support the campaign by\ngoing to a fundraising benefit gig\norganised by LSE on Wednesday\nDecember 5. Posters will be up around\nCollege at a later stage. Also, if you have\nany ideas on how Imperial College Union\ncan become personally motivated in this\ncampaign please contact the Union Office\nwith your ideas.\nMarianne Purcell, IC Women's Officer.\nCITY & GUILDS\nHIT SQUAD Flan your friends during\nRag Week\n\u00a31.50 students\n\u00a33.00 notables\nLecturers, etc, on request\nCall at the Guilds Office to book\nyour hits\nSt Mary's Annual\nRUGBY CLUB\nBALL\nSaturday 17th November\n9pm \u00a310 single, \u00a318 double\nTickets on sale at St Mary's Held at St Mary's Formal dress\nSCIENCE, ART & ETHICS\nInternational scientist and poet talks about\nscience and creativity.\n'Miroslav Holub is one of the half dozen\nmost important poets writing anywhere'\n\u2014Ted Hughes, Poet Laureatte.\nTUESDAY 13th NOVEMBER\n1.15PM READ LECTURE THEATRE,\n5TH FLOOR, SHERFIELD\nOrganised by the National Poetry Society, as a part of a national tour, and IC Humanities Deptartment\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nSteve Ragamuffin' verbose ly speaks out on...\nCharitable Fun\nBy now everyone should kno.w what Rag\nis. The main aim is to raise money for\ncharity whilst having a fun time. This\nmay seem impossible, but it does work. I feel totally justified in saying that,\nbecause anyone who turns up to a Rag\nWeek event will automatically raise some\nmoney for the worthwhile charities we\nsupport this year and experience the best\nway to enjoy yourself that's legal. So\nwhat is Rag Week? This is twelve days of\nevents starting next Wednesday. Each\nevent is worth going to, so enjoy\nyourself, let your hair down, forget all\nabout those (erm)...lectures.\nTa very much,\nSteve, Happy IC Rag Chairman.\nHow to make a fully functioning Rag\nWeek.\nIngredients:\nLots of students, each with...\n1 sense of humour\n1 sense of adventure\n1 monster thirst\n1 brain\nStockings, basque, goats etc\n1 sci-fi fetish\n1 plastic bag and box of cotton wool\nLots of work to do\nSome lecture notes (A4, any subject)\nThe desire to be entertained (TDTBE)\nFirst, we take the cotton wool, plastic bag\nand monster thirst and put them into the\nJCR on Wednesday 14th. Here we\nexperience the Beer Festival. This is the\ntraditional start to Rag Week. There are\n60 barrels of beer, cider and per ries. It\nruns from 12 noon 'till 11pm. The way it\nworks is: you buy a glass for \u00a3 3 , this\ncarries the official beer festival logo and\nis the only receptacle into which beer is\nserved, and presumably quaffed. For the\nhealth food fiends, there should be curries\nand burgers too. The monster thirst\nshould be allowed to soak in alcohol for\nany of the 11 hours of the festival. The\nplastic bag is for wrapping up your brand\nnew Rag Mag, which is launched at the\nfestival. The wrapping protects the Rag\nMag from the reader, and vice-versa. If\nyou don't have a sense of humour for\nyour ingredients list. One can be found\nfree, in the Mag. Special limited edition 'Elephants Come\n91' t shirts will also be on sale from the\nRag stall along with other t shirts, mags,\nmugs etc. The cotton wool is used to\nwrap the student and/or beer glass, to\navoid getting it smashed.\nOn the Thursday (15th) we have Rocky\nHorror Disco in the Union Lounge. This\nrequires the basque and stockings. The\nnight involves a bar extension, a disco,\nthanks to the Ents kids and also the film.\nThe basque and stocking should then be\nleft to stand until (i) the Rag Raid or (ii)\nThe Mines Dirty Disco.\nFriday (16th) sees the Hypnosis\nLecture. For this, take along the sense of\nadventure and the brain to the great hall.\nMartin S Taylor is a very good hypnotist.\nI 've even seen him hy p not is e people to\nlaugh at FELIX, or even strange, imagine\nthat everyone else in the room was\nslowly taking off their clothes. The\nlecture is a must for anyone who's sceptical of hypnosis or just wants a brilliant night's entertainment (bring\nTDBTBE). If you're not sure about\nvolunteering, don't worry. Martin has\nmore to lose than you if he does anything\nnaughty and he doesn't do anything too\nembarrassing anyway. If you're still\nbuilding the Rag Week at this point, let\nyour brain run free around the room. Let\nsomebody else control it for a while.\nOn Saturday we begin to get rather\nbusy. We have the Sci-Fi Marathon in\nthe SCR where you can watch videos and\nplay games. Bring along your sci-fi fetish\nwith you for 12 hours of intergalactic\nbliss. For anybody who's stored away the\nbasque etc, they should come in very\nhandy at the Rag Raid. This is a trip to\nReigate to collect for BIBIC and is lots of\nfun. It leaves the van park at 10am. In the\nevening SCAB take over, for SCAB Night. Don't worry it's not infectious, just\nthe entertainment/performance people\n(Dramsoc, Rocksoc, Opsoc etc) putting on\none big production. So give TD BT BE some exercise.\nOn Sunday, you have the chance to get\nout of your brain and social is e, with an\ninter-CCU bar night. Everyone should be\nproviding a barrel (including me) so it\nshou d turn out to be very interesting\nindeed.\nMonday plays host to Comedy Night in\nthe Concert Hall. There are a couple of\ncomics and a com per e. Ents are providing\na disco, with a bar until 12 o 'clock.\nNext comes the C& GU Slave Auction,\non Tuesday 20th. So if you have your\n'lots of work to do' ready, why not get\nsomebody else to do it. Slaves are\nbrought for a24 hour period (any time)\nbut must be fed and watered. If you plan\nto go for any of the tastier morsels, it's best to group-bid, as Rugby Club usually\nprovide fierce competition. If anyone\nwants to be a slave they can sign up in\nthe Guilds Office (Mech Eng, Level 3).\nThis is followed by Exec Initiative,\nwhere the execs are dropped off in the\nmiddle of nowhere and have to get back\nto College, armed with only a lOp piece,\na Rag can and chained to somebody else.\nIn the evening we have a Barn Dance in\nthe JCR, which is pretty barn-like.\nIt's brain time again on Wednesday\n21st, with the Bar Quiz. There's a chance\nto beat that monster thirst by winning\nlots of beer and several other prizes too.\nTeams should be up to five people. On Thursday lunchtime there's plenty\nhappening in Beit Quad. For a few\npennies you can show your appreciation\nof the Union and C CU execs by pouring\nunpleasant things over them. Meanwhile,\noverhead there are Aerosoc Darts flying\naround. There's a prize for the furthest\nand longest flights. The planes are\nlaunched from Beit roof. So, those lecture\nnotes are A4 aren't they? At night ther's the super, massive, RCS Smoking\nConcert. This is a collection of rather\ndubious acts. Anyone who possesses a sense of humour is welcome to enter an\nact. If you have any ideas, see Louise\nRafferty, RCS Office, Old Chemistry.\nThe entire Union Building is taken over\non Friday (23rd) for Guilds Carnival. By\nthis point, if you feel very tired but don't want to stop, you're Rag Week is nearly\ncomplete, however first you mut bt tle through two bands, videos, films and a couple of discos, burgers, cocktails and a2 am bar extension. Any potential helpers,\nsee Lucia Clipstone, Che mEng II (or\nC& GU).\nRelaxation is the name of the game on\nSaturday 24th. We start with a leisurely\nstreak back from Harrods: a leap from a truck, wearing only a parachute, outside\nHarrods\u2014it's The Sponsored Kamikaze\nParachute Jump. (No brain, but a sense\nof adventure required)\u2014see Steve Farrant\nDoC III or at the Rag Meeting if you want\nto take part).\nThe afternoon has Bar Sports. So\nteams of people who want to show their\nexperience at darts, shove ha'penny,\nbackgammon etc should meet in the bar.\nThere's also a knockout pool tournament\nin the Snack Bar.\nOn Sunday (25th) it'sC CU time again.\nThe traditional Tug-o War takes place at\n11am in Princes Gardens, followed by a possible Raft Race over the Serpentine\nfor the C CU execs.\nAnd then, finally, on Monday26 th we\nhave the Mines Dirty Disco. The key\nword here is 'Dirty'. This has a reputation\nfor being probably the wildest\ndebauch ero us party in Rag Week. It's organised by the RS M and anything goes.\n(Except perhaps the goats, so cross those\noff the ingredients list.) So get that kinky\nunderwear out of the closet and show\nyour perversion to a room full of\nstrangers.\nThat's about it really, except there are\nHitsquad (Guilds), Gnoming, GrimReapery and Pint-a grams (RCS Office)\nand Killer (RCS Office) running\nthroughout Rag Week. So go and see the\nrespective people for information.\nOT1X)\n10\n\n"

    "content": "The Ides of November\nTom Stevens, the Business Manager for\nImperial College, was dismissed in an\nunexpected move last Friday. He was not\ngiven any notice and cleared his desk in\nthree hours, after being called in specially\non his day off. There has been much\nspeculation upon the reasons behind the\naction, but nobody is aware of, or willing\nto reveal, the full official motives behind\nthe sacking.\nQuestioned officials were keeping their\nknowledge close to their chests as\nrumours spread. Mr Rob Northey told\nFelix that he was 'surprised' by the move,\nalthough his answers were short and\nobviously pre-planned. It is known that\nMr Northey had been quite surprised by\nthe fact that Felix had not questioned him\nupon the matter earlier.\nManaging Director of the College,\nAngus Fraser, was also keeping tight\nlipped over the situation. He reacted in\nmuch the same way over Mr Northey's decision to resign three weeks ago\nalthough he seemed more confident about\nthis issue. When asked about the reasons\nbehind the sacking he said that he was\n'not going to make any comment' on why\nMr Stevens was dismissed, and that he\ndid not see the advantage in speculation.\nIn particular Mr Fraser would not\ncomment on the speed of dismissal or the\nreactions of the Rector, now in India.\nThe Rector was present at the time of\nthe meeting which decided the fate of Mr Stevens and left for India on 28th October, five days before the dismissal\nwas made. It is thought that a decision\nwas made that depended upon the\nopening of the tendered bids for\nMontpellier occurring on 1st November,\nfor which the reserve price was &7.5M. It\nwould appear that no suitable applications\nwere received.\nMr Stevens was instrumental, in part, in\nthe setting up of the Clayponds contracts\nwith the estate agents Cluttons, which lost\nthe College an estimated \u00a3300,000, and\nwas in charge of the sale of Montpellier\nHall.\nAngus Fraser did say that arrangements\nhad been made to split the responsibilities\nof Tom Stevens job. This naturally\nincluded Rob Northey on the catering\nside and Gordon Marshall, the relatively\nnew Director of Estates, on the estates\nside. This split leaves the situation much\nas it was before the appointment of a Business Manager. He did not however\nwish to make any further comment on\nthe appointment of a new person to the\nnow vacant position. It is thought that\nthese matters were discussed at an\nunscheduled meeting at 170 Queensgate,\nthe Rector's residence, on Wednesday.\nPeople present included Angus Fraser,\nPeter Mee and one of the Deans from the\nConstituent Unions.\nAngus Fraser-No Comment\nAs far as Clayponds went he said that\nhe had 'nothing to say on that point at\nthis time' but the matter was being\npursued to final is ation, as had been\nplanned.\nRob Northey is now staying on as\nRefectories Manager and is likely to be\nhere until l sometime around July. On this\nmatter Angus Fraser said he had had a chat with Rob and that they had agreed\nto defer his finishing date. Previously,\nafter Mr Northey's resignation, he had\nfailed to persuade him to remain, despite\na two hour long meeting.\nCollege Day Elicits Response\nYesterday, the threat of a longer college\nday produced the largest turnout for a Union General Meeting (UGM) this year.\nOne motion and two bye-laws were\npassed, the motion being that the Union\nPresident, Paul Shanley, should convey to\nthe Working Party on the College Day\nthe stance that changes to the college\nday are not acceptable and that the, over-theoretical, workloads should be reduced\nfrom their artificial y high state.\nThe first bye-law change, speeding up\nthe merger of ICU and St Mary's was\npassed without discussion. The second,\nallowing sabbaticals to stand for a second\nyear was passed after a short debate. The\nbye-law change will not allow a student\nto have more than two sabbatical years\nand restricts cam paining to acts that in\nno way affect their sabbatical duties. Both\nof these bye-laws must be passed at the\nnext U GM at St. Mary's before they are\naccepted.\nAfter the bye-laws had been passed,\nPaul Shanley asked the assembly for\nfeedback to take to the Working Party as\nhe felt that he was not a representative\nstudent in this matter. Taking a series of\nvotes, he found that most of the students\npresent would prefer the college day to\nremain as it is, although some would\ntolerate an extra half hour in the\nmorning and/ or evening.\nMost of the objections to any changes\nstemmed either from traveling times and\nthe difficulty of reaching the college early\nin the morning or the difficulty of getting\nto hall meals in time.\nThe RCS handed to Paul a survey that\nhad been undertaken in various\ndepartments. The overwhelming\nstatement made by 646 replies to the\nsurvey was that the college day should\nremain as it is.\nChair Awarded KO!\nDr Tony Ridley, who has recently worked\non the Eurotunnel project, has been\nannounced as the holder of the Rees\nJeffreys Chair of Transport Engineering in\nthe Department of Civil Engineering.\nThe Chair is sponsored by the Rees\nJeffreys Road Fund who's interests are\nbased upon the recognition that travel\nand movement of goods has to balanced\nwith the limitations of land space and\nen vi rome nt. The Rector said that 'His appointment\nwill serve further to enhance the\nworldwide reputation of the Department'.\nThe Imperial College Engineering School\nhas already been nominated by several\nhundred academics within the EC, in a poll, as the best in Europe and this\nappointment can only help to keep it's status as such.\nA flying elbow sent Cathy McClay, City\nand Guilds Union President, into\nconcussion last Thursday. The hit and run\nelbow occured on the dance floor of the\nC&G Boat Party.\nCathy was tended by Warwick Mullen\nand Claire Kerry whilst the party\ncontinued and was taken to hospital\nwhen it ended. Cathy said that she had\nnot been into college much during the\nweek but was recovering.\n2\n\n"

    "content": "Abaya\nDear Chris,\nHaving read the second letter by\nAthena, I now realise how mistaken S Choudhery was to attempt to reply with a sensible factual argument. It is clear that\nAthena likes being controversial and\ninflammatory, hoping to overcome\napathy. I am, however, concerned\n(honest, 1 am losing sleep over that one!)\nthat there may be some people out there\namong your readership who actually hold\nsuch views. It is quite hopeless to try to\nreason with such people, but fortunately\nthe majority of your readership are quite\nsensible people. I thought it would be\nworthwhile to look at the workings of\nAthena's few brain cells in an attempt to\nexplain this strange phenomenon.\nThere are two points I would like to\nmake here. First, I would like to\napologise to all Greeks and admirers of\nGreek culture for the rather inappropriate\nname chosen by the specimen in\nquestion. To avoid confusion I shall refer\nto our subject as 'Ath', thus sparing\nAthena the humiliation of being\nassociated with A th. Secondly, may I apo lig is e in advance\nfor my ignorance of Ath's language but I do have an excuse. You see, I come from\nan ancient civilisation, and while Ath's ancestors were occupying charming cave\ndwellings and communicating in a combination of grunts and body odour s, my ancestors were already quite fluent in\nan ancient language. Alas, it was not\nEnglish. I am, however, making an honest\nattempt to learn the language. This is due\nmainly to the fact that Iam studying at\none of 'his' Universities (thus sub sidi sing the Government), and not because I have\ninvaded any of his allies. On that point, I don't quite see the wisdom in learning\nAth's language if all I want to do is\ninvade one of his country's allies, but on\nthe other hand, being allied to Kuwait, it\nmay be worthwhile for culturally more\nadvanced people like himself to learn its\nlanguage.\nBack now to Ath's brain cells. It is\ninteresting to see the warped logic in\nminds such as his. Take, for example, his\nviews on mature cultures. He assumes, of\ncourse, that his culture is several hundred\nyears more mature than others. I presume he also thinks that it is better\nfor the future of the world as a whole if\nall peoples of the worlds adopt his\nculture. I don't know about you, but I would worry if the accepted notion of a good time, in the world's most mature\nculture were to be: the elimination of all\ntraces of blood from one's alcohol,\nfollowed by excessive vomiting, urinating\nthrough other people's letter boxes and\nabusive behaviour towards all people\ndeemed to be of a 'less mature' culture.\nAnother interesting illusion in the\nspecimen's clouded reasoning, is that\nwhole races can be culturally immature.\nThis obviously means that backwardness\nis hereditary. This could be of great value\nto scientific research into anthropology,\nsince it probably means that Ath's ancestors used to relieve themselves in the entrances of each others' caves, a fact\nwhich, if verified by any excavations or\nsuch like, could explain a hell of a lot!\nAs for Ath's political views I think that\nthey are not really worth examining, not\neven in jest, because for many people in\nthis college including myself, it would be\nin very bad taste indeed. I still meet\nfriends who have just come out of\nKuwait, and have lost contact with many\nothers who are still there. There are\npeople in this college whose families are\nstill inside. Lives have been lost and\nmany more could still be lost. The end\nresult of all this is more frustration and\noppression of those 'culturally immature'\npeople for the sake of everyone else's political and economic interests.\nFinally, let us not forget that people\nlike A th in positions of power are\ndangerous. It was not so long ago, that\nthey were in hysterics about the\nbackward culture coming out of Iran, and were all in favour of Saddam Hussein\n'...spending his money, not for the good\nof the people, but on arms, developing\nnuclear weaponry, chemical weaponry,\nfighting lengthy wars and killing people...'\n. Yours sincerely,\nAmin El-Choly, DoC PG.\nP. S.Iam expecting a reply from A th, because my critical examination of the\nnon-functioning of his brain reveals that\nhe would not pass up on such an\nopportunity to make even more a fool of\nhimself. I urge you to cast the same\ncritical eye on such a reply, to witness for\nyourself how such 'minds' work.\nP.P. S. It is quite possible that the\nspecimen is quite aware of its sad\naffliction, and therefore refuses to reveal\nits true name. Come out of the closet\nAth, it may not be curable, but we can\nstop it spreading.\nPostgrad Lunch 12.30pm Chaplains Office (10 Princes Gardens).

    "content": "Sailing\nThe weekend of 3 and 4 November\nturned out to be one of great contrasts as\nfar as IC Sailing Team were concerned.\nThirteen teams from all over the\ncountry had converged at the Welsh Harp\nfor a weekend of sailing, drinking and\nbonfire making. The trouble started\nduring the first match against IC Old Boys, who administered a sound\nthrashing and continued through Saturday\nuntil a short, sharp swim led to a substitution in our last race of the day.\nSwansea ladies had a bad start but with\na fumble at the bottom mark by our\nsecond boat, they managed to get past\nand they achieved a2,3,4 winning\ncombination. In a last bid to stave off\ndefeat the offender took a different route\nto the finish to the rest of the field; only\nto find himself in second place across the\nline and IC winning their second race this\nterm.\nIt was now time for the main part of\nthe day's business: the lighting of the\nbonfire, the setting off of fireworks and\nthe drinking of beer.\nUnfortunately we were scheduled for\nthe first race the next morning, but a quick search through the bodies littering\nthe clubhouse could only locate a grand\ntotal of two team members (out of six).\nUndaunted, Richard Murray and Henry\nNebrensky decided to compete anyway\nafter borrowing a few people and Liam's late arrival. Just as we were leaving the\npontoon, we faced UEA again. They had\nalready beaten us the previous day, but\nsome small battered remnant of team\nspirit pulled us together for a confusing\nhectic race that left them defeated.\nWe set off in a good mood for our next\nrace. Swansea II had clearly not\nrecovered from the night before, their\ndefence crumbled as we swept to a1,2,3 victory. Unfortunately the rest of our\nraces ended up being cancelled.\nDo you need a cupboard?!\nA53 cmx90.5c mx180 cm wooden\ncupboard in a very good condition;\nused for only 3 months. It was bought\nfor \u00a3200, but it'll be sold for \u00a395.\nThe cupboard is in Linstead Hall\nBasement. If you want to have a look\nat it or get more information please\ncontact:\nMaha Halabi, BSc III Computing\nClubs Dance\nDance Club activities are in full swing\nnow, with the Ballroom, Latin American\nand Rock 'n' Roll lessons well attended\nand the teams training hard. We are\nstarting an Intermediate Rock 'n' Roll\nclass on Monday evenings at 6pm in the\nJCR. Any beginners from last year or\npeople with some experience are\nwelcome to come along.\nWe are holding a24 hour sponsored\ndance marathon for the BBC Children in\nNeed Appeal on November 16/17 in the\nJCR. Not quite as tiring as it sounds participants have to dance 12 hours\n(minimum!) on a rota system. This way\nwe always have a good number on the\nfloor. Last year we raised \u00a35,000. We'd like to do better this year, so anyone\ninterested in having a lot of fun for a good cause can collect details from any of\nour lessons.\nA quick plug for the 1990 London Ball\non December 8. This event combines lots\nof social dancing with the chance to enter\ncompetitions, even at beginner level. It is\na great opportunity to show off your new\nsteps in a light-hearted atmosphere.\nDetails available in lessons.\nWe will be starting new beginners\nclasses in January for all you would-be\ndancers who didn't get going and join in\nthis term. So come along and learn to\ndance in time for the Spring Balls!\nEnviro\nThe Society had its first lunchtime lecture\non October 22, given by Dr Shanklin of\nthe British Antarctic Survey on the\n'Ozone hole over the Antarctic'. The title\nof the lecture differed from the one\nadvertised, and we would like to\napologise for this and promise that it will\nnot happen again. The lecture was very\nenjoyable with some spectacular slides.\nThanks to all of you who attended the\nlecture, and we hope to see you in our\nfuture events.\nMany more lectures and events have\nbeen arranged for this term, which will\nbe listed in the Society's newsletter sent\nto all current members. The list of\nmembers includes only those who joined\nthis year, and so please renew your\nmembership (\u00a31.50) at the weekly\nmeeting, which takes place every Monday\nat 12.30pm in the Southside Upper\nLounge.\nULUGay\n& Lesbian\nThe three meetings held so far this term\nhave attracted a large attendance.\nMichael Cashman (Eastender's Colin)\nspoke to us on October 11 about the\nneed for more equality for lesbians and\ngays in Britain. A question-and-answer\nsession highlighted what we could all do\nto help this come about.\nOur first social occasion (October 18)\nenabled new faces to get to know each\nother. A new committee for 1990/91 was\nelected, and the society's library of over\n80 books was made available to all those\npresent. A discussion was initiated\nconcerning experiences of 'coming out',\nand any lessons learnt were passed on to\nthose who need it.\nThis coming week our guest speaker is\nChris Smith\u2014the only 'out' gay MP in the\nHouse of Commons. He will be talking\nabout Labour's policy towards lesbians\nand gays. An opportunity for questions\nand discussion will follow.\nWe meet each week, as always, at\n7.30pm in Room2 D( second floor) of the\nUniversity of London Union, Malet Street,\nLondon WC1. For further information or\ncorrespondence, you can contact the\ncommittee through the society pigeonhole\non the ground floor at UL U, or to me via\nthe Geology department student mail\nhere at IC (second floor, RSM).\nMany thanks to last year's committee\nfor a marvellous job at such initial short\nnotice.

Once upon a time\nhe was a humble Felix bir o, but he\nbecame bored with his tiresome mundane\nexistence. Being used to proof reviews\nand features was no life for an aspiring\nyoung bir o. So, one day he decided to\nmake a run for it. Leaping ball first into\nthe office black hole, he was transported\nfar away, never to return....\n\u201eUtU ********\nr Lo** A/ Dear Chris,\nSorry about my sudden disappearance\nlast week, but being used on the Edwina\nCurry article was too much for a self\nrespecting bir o.1 have to say that my new life is much more interesting with\nmy new owner.\nHe's very well off and lives in a big\nhouse not far from you. He prefers to\nspend other people's money even though\nhe's got lots of his own. For a knight\nbachelor, his sartorial taste leaves a lot to\nbe desired, 1 mean really, strip and spot\nlighting in a panelled room? His residence\nis very large, so maybe I 've only seen the\ntacky bits.\nHe took me along to a meeting this\nweek, and when he left me on the table I had a chance to overhear a conversation\nhe was having with somebody from the\nlocal council. Iam so pleased to have\nsuch a generous owner who wants to\nbuild lots of rooms for young people he\nknows. He must like them a lot, because\nhe's trying to keep them all together, in\nfact he's even giving up a nice garden\n(something to do with a prince 1 believe)\nfor them.\nThe nice man from the council said that\nthere would not be a problem with\nplanning permission, and my owner says\nhe can get the money from Harlington\n(the banks here have posh names, don't they?). I do find it difficult to believe that\nthere won't be any interest on a \u00a32\nmillion loan, though. Lots of the young\npeople eventually become accountants, so\nmaybe they arrange it.\nHe wants it to be a nice surprise so he's not telling anyone about it.

    "content": "Eat Interview\nThe time: 5.45pm, the place: the ladies\ntoilets in the Astoria. Ange, Michael\nHutchens look-a like and Eats' lead singer\nsat on the windowsill stradlin ga sink\nlooking bored whilst Paul, guitarist, busily\nmade a spl iff. When asked why they\ncalled themselves Eat, Paul replied 'It's like a reflection of our concern for\nconsumerism. Ha, no, it's probably\nbecause the first song we ever wrote\ntogether was called Eat Eat Eat so it\nseemed to fit'.\nNext there was a loud bang as the\ntoilet door flew open and in stepped an\nAstoria muscle man 'Get out of here you\nfucking arse holes', nice chap, it's really\nodd too, he looked like Jimmy Saville.\nWe restarted the interview backstage\nfighting to be heard over the sound check\nof the support group. Eat have been\ntogether for three years now although all\nof the members have known each other\nfor much longer and have been in\nvarious other groups, most notably Pete\nHoward, former Clash drummer, but they\nhave only really been a public band since\nFebruary last year when they were\nsigned up by Fiction records. The band is\nLondon-based and has a close affinity to\nthe city. 'Our first album reflected our life\nin London at the time of the band\nforming, squatting, moving around very\nquickly lugging each others' gear around,\nliving in each others' pockets'.\nEat don't really fall into any musical\ncategory as such. Their sound has almost\na Mancunian feel about it but is saved by\nthe rock guitar and punk ish vocals. This\nstrange mixture comes from the fact that\nall of the members have different musical\ntastes, ranging from dance to blues.\nThey are currently working on a new\nalbum which is due for release in\nFebruary. It's taken about five weeks to\nrecord so far and should be finished soon.\n'We feel that on this album we've finally\nfound ourselves musically and we're well\npleased at what we've done so far,\nalthough I don't like the new single\nmuch. It's good, but not quite right. The\nvocals are out of tune and the guitars\naren't loud enough.'\nTonight is the last night of their UK stint which brings an end to an extensive\nEuropean tour. Covering Germany,\nDenmark, France, to name but a few\ncountries. 'We've really enjoyed this tour.\nEspecially playing Denmark, it was\nbrilliant. It's really laid back. Really\nfantastically civilised. Like, the festival we\nplayed there was so cool. You could do\nanything, anywhere. There was even an\nS&M tent there if you're into that sort of\nthing. We played two gigs there, one in\nthe afternoon and one in the evening\nsince They Might Be Giants didn't show.\nThe best part was when we done a one-off gig in the jazz tent, there were all of\nthese people sitting around smoking pipes\nand war ing casual sweaters and we came\non. The place just filled with Danish\nrockers. Security couldn't handle it and\nbegged us to get off stage so that they\ncould regain control of the place. It was\ngreat, we love one-off gigs, they're the\nicing on the cake.\n'I remember playing with the\nWonderstuff once in Gloucester, and we came on stage and I got this wet reeking\nbra right in my face, the two cups just\nstuck, one on each ear, it was gross,\nbloody funny though. My wife was going\nto arrange for someone to throw pants\nlined with Philadelphia at us whilst we\nwere on, that would have been well sick\nmaking 'cos we wouldn't have known.' The band have no qualms about people\nbootlegging their concerts. ' We really like\nthe idea of someone having a kind of\nrecord of the gig they w re at, something\nto remember it by. I'm not so sure about\nthe people who bootleg to make money\nbecause most of the time they are selling\nsub-standard copies and are basically\nripping the fans off. We gave The Mission\nthe idea of setting aside part of the venue\nyou are playing at just for recording\nequipment so that people can make\ndecent bootlegs. I remember talking to\nWayne one night in a bar and saying you\nknow what you should do mate and he\nwent sort of 'Oh right, yeh, burp' as he\ntends to do in the evening 'cos he's usually out of his box by 5 o 'clock, so he\ngoes 'Eh...yeh...argh....mmm' and passed\nout, next concert they were doing it.'\nEat have serious money problems at\nthe moment. The tour, although they\nplayed to packed crowds, has lost money\nand they are on the verge of bankruptcy.\nHopefully they will get the money they\nneed from the new album but things are\ngoing to be hard over the next few\nmonths summed up well by Paul:\n'Sometimes I wish I was working in\nDixons'.\nBrian.

    "content": "PI Israel REVIEWS The state of the art\nThe Barbican Centre is running an\nAutumn season of Israeli arts and\nculture.\nThe art is broad based: painting,\nsculpture, photography, film and talks are\nall on offer. I visited the Chagul to Kitaj\nexhibition (9th Level) and Israel\u2014The\nStormy years (5th Level).\nChagul to Kitaj: Jewish Experience in\nthe Art of the Twentieth Century, to give\nit its full title, is the first major exhibition\nin Britain to bring together a broad range\nof works which reflect Jewish themes and\nconcerns this century.\nThe first few galleries focus on religion\nand the family; colours and textures are\nvivid. The thread then weaves Jewish\nculture in with its environment. There is\na fascinating display of set designs\nproduced by Jewish artists at the time of\nthe Russian Revolution including work by\nNathan Altman and Robert Falk.\nSome of the greatest figures in the\ntwentieth century are featured, such as\nMarc Chagull and Jacob Epstein. Their\nwork is shown alongside that of leading\nIsraeli artists such as Reaven Rubin and\nAnna Ticho.\nA separate section on the Holocaust\nincludes powerful works created both\nduring and after the war years. They\nshow the raw edge of personal and\ncollective anger and grief.\nOn the ground floor are works which\nhave been produced within the last ten\nyears. Although this art is more\ncontemporary the themes can be traced\nback through the entire exhibition.\nA narrow wooden gangway,\nreminiscent of a building site leads out\nfrom the exhibition into the 'sculpture\ncourtyard'. At the end of the gangway is\nan olive tree closely guarded by tall\nwooden ramparts. Surrounding this\nsymbol were other images of Mother\nEarth and good. My favourite was the\nbright yellow nude astride a bright yellow\nbicycle peddling madly in pursuit of\npeace.\nIsrael\u2014the stormy years is on the fifth\nfloor. The exhibition is a collection of\nphotographs by Robert Lepa and Misha\nBar-Am.\nRobert Lapa, a Hungarian Jew, arrived\nin Israel in 1936. He held a fervent\ninterest in the new country and, but for\nan all powerful wanderlust, he would\nhave settled there. His pictures are direct\nand, to the modern eye, perhaps even\nnaive. His camera recorded what he saw:\nno frills.\nMisha Bar-Am belonged to the next\ngeneration where ideals were often\nswamped by political complexity and\nbitter struggle. His photography is less\ndirect and more questioning than Lapas';\nhis actual technique and its message are\nmore subtle.\nWhatever your political persuasion the\nBarbican's Israeli season is a fun and\ninexpensive cultural feast. Israel State of\nthe Art (\u00a34 full \u00a3 2 concession) closes on\nJanuary 6 1991. Israel\u2014The Stormy Years\n(free) ends on November 29. Don't miss\nthem!\nAnna Teeman.\nLove at Large\nHarry Dobbs' private life is falling\napart. He is on the edge of turning\nforty, his girlfriend imagines that he is\nsleeping with all his clients and he is\nfollowing the wrong man. His latest,\nseductive and mysterious client Miss\nDolan has hired him to follow 'Rick', a man she is infatuated with. Unfortunately,\nRick arrived at the Blue Danube late and\nHarry is after Frederick King instead.\nWho's that following Harry, though?\nThe plot of this movie is more than a little convoluted, and doesn't quite\nmanage to explain itself by the end, but I have a sneaking suspicion that isn't meant to be important. Somebody is\npulling a bluff on us. The movie is trying\nto pass itself off as a detective film, and\nindeed Tom Berenger, who doesn't so\nmuch speak, as growl articulately, is the\nepitome of a hard-boiled detective. Really,\nthough, in its heart of hearts, it's a love\nstory, or at least a story about love.\nThe characters all have their own\nphilosophy about love, and have a strange tendency to inflict it on each\nother at regular intervals. The word is\nlove, as distinct from sex, for the two\nbacked beast only puts in one appearance\nin the whole film. The relationships\nbetween the players are affected by the\nminor characters' own bizarre love lives.\nWeird but strangely affecting stuff.\nThis is not a film that has spent much\ntime currying public acceptance -commercialism doesn't seem to have\nbeen sitting in the director's brain as an\neconomic conscience. Luckily the film is\nall the better for it. Funny, romantic and\nexciting, it will make a perfect evening's viewing.\nPendragon.\nBackstage tours\nof the National/1\nwant to be a Vicar\nOne common feature of fringe\ntheatres, be they the numerous\nvenues around London or the even more\nnumerous Edinburgh sites, is their\nintimacy (ie they're small). Most\nproductions use them as if they were a normal theatre, ignoring the audience.\nThe first of these short one act comedies\ndefies this convention, by making the\naudience part of the backstage tour party.\nOur guide takes us on a tour, not only of\nthe 'National' itself, but of the jargon,\npretentiousness and pretence that are the\nendemic complaints of theatrical hangers\non. The word Dahlings springs to mind.\nAdmittedly some knowledge of theatre\nwould be useful, otherwise most of the\njokes are going to leave you mirthless,\nbut in the main this is a very funny\nspoof.\nSo, we move onto the second half of\nthe evening - / Want to be a Vicar. A quirky little tale of a girl who has\naspirations to the cloth. She has a welsh\nmum who would prefer her to be a tart,\na boyfriend who has a Jesus complex and\na vicar who loves babies. In the course of\nhalf an hour, one actress takes us through\nher life, from theological college via\nAmerica to success as a transvestite vicar.\nThe audience's reaction to the play was\nvery mixed. Many people seemed to find\nit merely silly, while others were in\nstitches. Alcohol consumption level\nseemed to play a fair part in determining\nreaction.\nThe theatre is above a pub, so my\nadvice would be:- if you fancy a drink\nand a bit of comedy, this may be worth a visit, if only for the National segment.\nThese plays are at the Etcetera Theatre\nClub, Oxford Arms, 265 Camden High\nRoad, NW1. The Box Office is on\n071-482-4857. Membership is 75p and\nstudent tickets cost \u00a3 3 .\nPendragon.\n\u2014Film\n\u2014Theatre\n\u2014Exhibition\n\n"

    "content": "Aaron's Beard\nDear Sir,\nIn reply to Athena's letter of 2.11.90.\nI must question the motives of one who is prepared to take pot-shots at both\ncandidates for the RCSU Presidential\nelection, but is not prepared to provide\nhis/her real name.\nThe election could have been better\npublicised, but both candidates ran\nextensive publicity campaigns, every\naspect of which carried the dates of\nhustings and results. As usual, the hacks\nwere the only ones who volunteered to\nman ballot boxes and one cannot expect\nthem to stand all day. For these reasons,\nthe voting stations consisted of a hack, a chair and a black box, the latter being\nthe usual receptacle for voting slips. If the\naforementioned Athena wishes to\nquestion the honesty of the people who counted the votes, particularly the staff\nmember who was present, may I remind\nhim/ her that this is a very serious\nallegation and should be taken up with\nthe returning officer.\nThe letter did have some very valid\npoints; the RCSU had many problems last\nyear. Too few people tried to do too\nmany jobs, hence the academic failure,\nwhich was rife amongst last year's officers. This had led to a poor academic\nimage, which we are seeking to remedy.\nOn to the last aspect of the letter. If a non-hack standing for election and\nwinning means 'fucking the hacks', then\ndo it! James Briant, a non-hack, received\nmuch support from the officers during his\nPresidential campaign. He was shown\nPear Sir\nLETTERS\nhow the Union runs and personally\ninvited to events and meetings. In fact,\nnothing would please us more than to see\nhim getting involved with the Union,\nespecially if he wishes to consider\nstanding again.\nWe are always looking for suggestions\non improving the Union. We' ve made a lot of changes in the last couple of\nmonths and this has been reflected in the\nlarge number of first years who have\nexpressed interest in all aspects of the\nRCSU. If you have any input or want to\nget involved, come along to the office at\nany time\u2014you're always welcome.\nSuzanne Ahmet.\nP.S. Got any spot cream?\nAaron's Rod Dear Chris,\nUpon reading the article by Athena, I feel obliged to answer in support of MrS Choudhery. Athena's sole purpose in his\ninsolent article is to slag Saleem and Arab\nculture off. Maybe he should be reminded\nthat parts of our culture actually originate\nfrom the Far and Middle East.

    "content": "On October 24 at the House of Commons\nover 160 people, mainly women, of many\nages, races and nationalities, celebrated\nTime Off For Women with a lively\nspeak out: Count Women's WorkLegislation Now!. Every year Time Off\npresses governments to count women'sun waged work in every country's GNP, the basic statistic of work and wealth.\nWomen students in colleges and\nuniversities take part in Time Off each\nyear, highlighting, for example, the work\nof surviving on a grant, made more\ndifficult now with the loss of benefits, the\nextra work women have to do to prove\nthemselves academically, the fact that we\nhave less chance of earning higher\nwages, and the work of students who are\nmothers. Time Off 90 student actions\nincluded leafletting and petitioning at\nWarwick University and Froebel College,\nSouth London, and a rime Off-Day Picnic\nin Oxford city centre. Time Off won a paid day off for women employees at\nBristol Poly and Cardiff University\nStudents' Unions in recognition of their\nun waged work\u2014a guarantee now written\ninto their constitution.\nThe Speakout, co-chaired by Wilmette\nBrown( Black Women for Wages for\nHousework) and Nina Lopez-Jones\n(English Collective of Prostitutes), opened\nwith news of progress towards counting\nwomen's work legislation in Britain,\nEurope, Trinidad and Tobago and the US.\nWhile Time Off presses for legislation, it\nalso aims to ensure that women, and not\nlegislators, define the un waged work we\nwant counted by counting it ourselves. In\na hall decorated with colourful balloons\nand banners, women spoke out about the\nhousework of caring for families, for\nothers and for ourselves; working on the\nland; fetching firewood and water; the\nwork of overcoming the divisions\nbetween us, surviving and challenging\nracism, apartheid, ageism, discrimination\nagainst lesbian women, the\nimpoverishment of mining communities,\nlow pay, no pay, the poll tax, sex work\nbeing made illegal, rape and other\nviolence.\nWomen with disabilities, including\nwheelchair users who with the help of\nthe organiser had to struggle to get into\nan outrageously inaccessible House of\nCommons, made clear that people with\ndisabilities are also 'carers', caring for\nthemselves, children and others.\nDescribing some of that work, Claire\nGlasman of Win Visible (Women with\nVisible and Invisibale Disabilities) said:\n'Most of my un waged work of disability is\nnot caused by my disability but by social\npolicies are priorities which deprive us of\nmoney, services, carers of our choice,\nand appropriate equipment and\ntechnology to adapt our homes and the\nenvironment for our everyday use.'\nThe meeting heard messages of support\nfrom the Payday men's network against\nall un waged work, from MPs and trade\nPhoto: Lisa Longstaff\nunionists; and reports of Time Off 90\nactivities in about ten Third World and\nmetropolitan countries, and14 towns and\ncities in Britain.\nSelma James, founder of the Wages for\nHousework Campaign which coordinates\nTime Off, opened the Speakout saying\nthat while MPs 'debated whether to give\nChild Benefit to some, many, or no\nwomen, as if it were a charity, in fact the\nmoney is a right\u2014a small payment for\nthe work of mothering.' There was\nunanimous agreement on the following\nresolution:\nThis meeting is outraged that the\ngovernment who have been throwing\n&2ma day into the Gulf feel they can\nspare only &1 for an increase in Child\nBenefit to mothers for some children.\nEveryone welcomed the coming together\nof black and white women from so many\ndifferent backgrounds speaking out about\ntheir work as a reflection of how much\nthe Time Off movement is gaining\nground!\nStudents who'd like to take part in\nTime Off, invite speakers, or help\ncirculate the ' Women Count\u2014Count\nWomen's Work' petition available in 23\nlanguages and in English braille, contact\nthe Wages for Housework Campaign,\nKing's Cross Women's Centre, 71\nTonbridge Street, W C1H9 DZ.

    "content": "FELIX\nRoland Flowerdew investigates the history that led to Professor\nFreedom Fightei\nProfessor Fang Li Zhi, the dissident\nChinese astrophysicist who has been\ndescribed as \"the most outspoken Chinese\nscientist in the last ten years\", is expected\nto lecture at Imperial College next\nWednesday. (See the news pages for\nmore details.) Professor Fang recently\nescaped from China, after a year in the\nUnited States' embassy in Peking. His\nrelease was probably partly in exchange\nfor the restoration of \"most-favoured\nnation\" trading status of China by the\nUSA.\nWhat part did Professor Fang play in\nthe Chinese students' protest in\nTiananmen Square, and why was he a key figure in the improvement of SinoAmerican relations?\nDuring this century many changes have\ntaken place in China, the third largest\ncountry in the world, and home to a quarter of the world's population. Until\nthe early 1900s, China was under the rule\nof dynastic emperors, and enjoyed a political system much as is seen in\npresent-day South Korea, Singapore and\nTaiwan: economic freedom but limited\npolitical freedom.\nChina's civilisation is one of the oldest\nin the world, but until the early\nnineteenth century it remained in relative\nisolation from surrounding civilisations.\nThis isolation meant that China failed to\nreact to the threat posed by the rise of\nimperialistic nations such as Great Britain,\nand it suffered in conflicts such as the\nOpium War in 1839-42, at the end of\nwhich Hong Kong was ceded to Britain.\nAfter this point internal troubles divided\nthe country, whilst the West and Japan\nbecame controlling powers.\nThe last Chinese dynasty ended in\nJanuary 1912. The Nationalist party\nattempted to unify the country, establish\nstatehood and introduce democracy.\nHowever, they never had complete\ncontrol over the whole country: the\npower was with the army and region was\nset against region. Minor civil wars broke\nout between Nationalists, Communists and\nlocal warlords.\nThis strife was thrown into confusion\nwhen Japan invaded in 1937, with the\nloss of many lives and the destruction of\nmuch of the national infrastructure. The\nJapanese occupation continued until the\nend of the second world war.\nOnce more civil war broke out between\nthe Nationalist and Communist parties.\nThe Communist party had the support of\nthe peasants who comprised the vast\nmajority of the population, and were\nperceived to have tried harder and done\na lot more against the occupying\nJapanese.\nThe civil war claimed between 11 and\n12 million lives, and ended when the\nNationalist party fled to the island of\nTaiwan and proclaimed the People's Republic of China. The general population\nof China were pleased that the\nDemonstration outside Chinese Embassy in June last year.\nCommunist party had come to power: the\ncountry was no longer in a state of civil\nwar, but was independent and free from\nforeign control.\nUnder the leadership of Mr Mao\nZedong, China turned to the USSR for\nadvice in building a socialist super state. In\nthe early 1950s, all land was taken into\nstate ownership, and the possession of\nmachinery, property, farm animals and so\non was forbidden. Slowly disenchantment\nbegan to set in.\nIn 1958 Mr Mao abandoned the Soviet\napproach, and launched the \"Great Leap\nForward\"; organising peasants into\ncommunes, and forcing them to meet\nstate-set production targets. During this\ntime intellectuals criticised the Communist\nparty, and 20-30% of university lecturers\nwere punished for their criticisms.\nThe \"Great Leap\" did not work: the\ncommune system had to be relaxed and\nincentives had to be introduced. The\nrecognition that economic Utopia was\nunsuccessful did not extend to politics,\nand in 1966 Mr Mao introduced the\nCultural Revolution.\nThis was an attempt to stop the\nemergence of an intellectual elite, and\nwas the external effect of a power\nstruggle within the Communist Party. It\naimed to clear out all capitalistic ideas\nand thoughts, and wiped out all the\nprevious economic achievements. As in\nthe French Revolution, many people were\ndenounced as being \"bourgeois\" and\n\"class enemies\", and tens of thousands\nwere killed.\nAlthough many people accepted this,\nothers began to look back and think.\nPerhaps a friend or relative had been\nkilled for saying things against the state,\nbut was anything wrong with that? They\nstarted to doubt.\nThe Cultural Revolution ended in 1976\nwith the death of Mr Mao, and Mr Deng\nXiaoping came to power. At first he\nallowed criticism, and there was a little\nmore freedom. Around1977 there was\nthe \"Peking Spring\", similar to Speaker's corner in Hyde Park, where people spoke\nout, and posters were allowed. However,\npeople began to get bolder and started to\ncriticise the then-current situation and Mr Deng himself, which he failed to\nappreciate, so the limited freedom was\nremoved altogether.\nIn 1979, a Chinese worker, formerly in\nthe army, began to criticise the\nCommunist party. Mr Wei Jing Sheng,\ndescribed as \"a pioneer in Chinese\ndemocracy\", said that Mr Deng should\nnot be treated like an emperor or another\nMao. He was jailed for 15 years, the\nofficial reason being that he had leaked a military secret to a foreign journalist.\n(Since he had no access to military\nsecrets this is hard to believe!)\nIt was after the incarceration of Mr Wei that Professor Fang became more\nFang Li Zhi's release from\noutspoken, in open or semi-open\ncircumstances. He made a lot of speeches\nat universities, and brought an insight\ninto what was going on. Many of the\nideas or thinking of the students who\ndemonstrated in Tiananmen Square\noriginated with him.\nThe students were the people who\nopenly stated their dissatisfaction with the\nChinese system. Interestingly, the\ndemonstration in Tiananmen Square was\nnot so much because of the lack of\npolitical freedom, although this is a major\nissue, but because of increased economic\nfreedom without controlling laws and\neffective taxation.\nWhat happened was that restrictions\nwere lifted: people are able to buy small\nhouses, to own corner shops, to own cars\nBUT the only people who can afford to\ndo this are those in or who have relatives\nin the Communist party structure. Not\nonly this, but supplies of goods to shops\nare controlled by party officials, and go\nChina.\nto those who know or bribe them.\nAny taxation system that existed before\nthe rise of Communism has been\nforgotten, hence those who have\ninfluence can make money and get rich\nvery quickly, whilst helping no-one else.\nThe party leaders still have absolute\npower, and their families make the most\nof it, a fulfilment of the Orwellian \"all are\nequal, but some are more equal than\nothers.\" In other words, a few people are\nin the position to make a lot of money\n(and do so), but at the expense of\neveryone else.\nThings came to a head in May last year\nwhen the inertial \"fear barrier\" was\nbroken: the students' feelings were shared\nby the general citizens and workers of\nPeking, culminating with the\ndemonstrations. The grievances are\nmany: the people are not happy with the\nbureaucracy and corruption of the\npresent government, the low wages and\nhigh inflation, the lack of restrictions as\nFELIX\ndescribed previously, the lack of political\nfreedom, the lack of true economic\nfreedom, the lack of freedom of speech\nand thinking.\nThe night after the massacre in\nTiananmen Square (4 June 1989),\nProfessor Fang sought sanctuary in the\nUS embassy, where he remained for\nnearly 13 months. At the end of June this\nyear, he arrived in the UK With his wife,\nProfessor Li Shuxian, and has since taken\nup a guest research professorship at the\nInstitute of Astronomy, University of\nCambridge.\nThe restoration of trade links with\nChina has been welcomed by dissidents in\nthis country, because they consider that\nsanctions will only make the country\nmore introspective and isolated. Trade\nmust continue so that people in China\ncan see some of the outside world and\ntell others what it is really like. The\ncampaign for Chinese democracy\ncontinues...\nOpinion: US-Arab Alliance Crumbles\nWhy did the United States of America,\nIsrael's most powerful ally, condemn her\nover the Temple Mount Killings?. The US\nis perceived as friendly towards Israel and\ninimical towards the Arab world. It was\nnecessary to reassure her new Arab military allies where her loyalty lay.\nThe US presence in the Gulf and Saudi\nArabia has complicated regional political,\nreligious and military problems. To a Moslem, the presence on Moslem soil of a Jew, Christian or pagan is totally\nunacceptable; to be within one thousand\nkilometres of Mecca or Medina, the\nholiest of Moslem sites, is sacrilegious.\nThe US army is the major foreign force in\nthe Gulf\u2014US army men are cooking\nsausages on Saudi Arabian soil while\nAmerican women are free to walk around\nwith uncovered faces and exposed skin.\nThe US, Israel's most powerful and\nrichest foreign sponsor, is now allied\nmilitarily with almost the entire Arab\nworld for mutual protection against the\nwhims of Saddam Hussein. The alliance is\nvulnerable: precarious enough for the US\nto sponsor its first United Nations\ncondemnation of Israel.\nWhy does the US need this alliance so\nbadly? The US economy is a mess; the\nbudget deficit is high and a new world\nrecession may be imminent. One man,\nSaddam Hussein, controls a large\nproportion of the world's oil supply. The\ncrisis could not have come at a more\ninopportune time. Despite all the\neconomic reasons for military\nintervention, the American government\nmust justify both its initial reaction and its\nescalating presence in the Gulf to the\nAmerican people.\nTheir first justification was the defence\nand maintenance of internationally\naccepted national boundaries. However,\nin recent weeks the US has introduced\nthe phrase 'a new world order'. They\nclaim that out of the crisis can come\npeace and serenity to the whole Volatile\nregion.\nThe vulnerability of the oil supply from\nthe Gulf is not a new issue. During the\nIran-Iraq war, the majority of foreign\nsupport was given to Iraq, which was\nperceived as a lesser threat to the oil\nsupply to the West. It was at this stage\nthat the CIA actively sponsored Saddam\nHussein's rise to power in Iraq. The\nSoviet Union supplied arms and military\nhardware, while the Germans and British\nhelped set up its chemical weapon\ncapability. Its future nuclear capability\n(only five to ten years away) was aided\nby Britons, Germans, Italians and French.\nBritish relations with Arab countries are\nambiguous; they are tainted with the\neffects of international terrorism. The\nbombing of Pan Am flight 103 was\norganised by a Palestinian terrorist group,\nbased in Damascus and supported by\nSyrians. The attempt to bomb an El Al flight in which the pregnant Irish\ngirlfriend of a Palestinian was tricked into\ncarrying a bomb in her suitcase, again\nreceived back-up from Syrians. Syrians\ncontrol the taking and release of hostages\nin the Lebanon; it seems that no hostages\nwill be released until Britain restores\ndiplomatic relations with Syria.\nIntervention by Europe and the US on\nbehalf of the Arab world against Saddam\nHussein can easily be interpreted as\nimperialistic action. This is distasteful to\nan Arab world which has suffered much foreign-intervention in recent times.\nHistorically the Moslem countries were\nunited in an Arab world and at times\nthere were no borders. However, this was\nbefore the concept of nation and\nnationalities really existed. Modern-day\nborders are seen as hangovers from\nimperialistic days. Although Arabs share a common religion this has not always led\nto peace in the region: as always, the\nquest for power and yet more power on\nthe part of a few results in strife and\ninstability.\nIt was imperialistic intervention that\nshaped the modern map of the Middle\nEast region. Kuwait is a principality, the\ncreation of which was heavily supported\nby the British historically. For a brief\nperiod in its history Kuwait was part of\nancient Iraq. However, the use of ancient\nborders as an excuse for invasion is\ninvalid.\nSeveral weeks after the invasion of\nKuwait, Saddam Hussein linked a possible\nmilitary withdrawal from Kuwait with an\nIsraeli withdrawal from Gaza and the\nWest Bank. At that point Israel was\ninextricably drawn into the conflict. The\nworld watched and waited. The killings at\nthe Temple Mount were a gift to Saddam\nHussein. It put the Arab-US alliance under\nthreat. Israel lost her blanket US support\nand her international credibility, and the\nfirst chink was made in the front against\nSaddam Hussein.\nAnna Teeman.\n\n"

    "content": "Chris Riley reports on the recent Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (IMM) Remote\nSensing conference in which two Soviet scientists out-shined the multi-million dollar\nsatellite technology on display, with their revolutionary telepathic prospecting methods\nof oil exploration.\nWhere Earth meets Sky This week saw the long awaited I MM conference on Remote Sensing at the\nvery unmemorable Novotel in\nHammersmith. Remote Sensing, as the\nname implies, involves surveying a planet; air, sea or land without direct\ncontact.\nSuch information from airborne sensors\noffers a different perspective; a synoptic\nor broad area coverage that makes it\npossible to view entire mountain ranges,\nriver drainage basins or complete\nweather systems. Isolated regions can be\nmapped and elevations, geological\nformations, drainage systems, water\ndepths or land-use patterns can be\nrecorded quickly and accurately.\nThe I MM Conference aimed to\nconcentrate on Remote Sensing as an\noperational technology for the mining\nand petroleum industries. The nature of\nthis subject brought the firmly Earthbased traditional geologists into contact\nwith 'high-flying', image processing,\nnumber crunching computer buffs.\nTalk in the bars, exhibition halls and\nrestaurants was of GIS (Geographic\nInformation Systems) Raster Graphics,\nVGA monitors, micro, mini and super\ncomputers, parallel processing, 286's,386' s, Landsat TM( Thermatic Mapper),\nMSS (Multi-Spectral Scanners), SPOT (the\nFrench satellite), panchromatic images,\nfalse colour composites, pattern\nrecognition, DEM's( Digital Elevation\nModels), M TM's( Digital Terrain Models),\nband ratios, edge enhancements, drop-outs, spectral signatures, megabytes,\ngigabytes and 'tr ilo bytes'!! Companies exhibiting at the conference\nranged from A/S GEO TEAM( representing\nENERGIA\u2014the Russian equivalent of\nNASA) to the Kent-based Nigel Press\nAssociates\u2014founded in 1972 by a former\nImperial MSc student; all proudly\ndisplaying aesthetically pleasing false\ncolour images.\nMouses clicked and hard discs whirred,\nsending swirling paint box pictures of\nartificially coloured deserts and mountain\nranges onto high resolution screens.\nThere were those developing software\nto strip away vegetation coverings from\nimages, revealing potential mineral\nsettings and thus prompting the real\ndestruction of the vegetation during\nexploration! Others were content to\ndevelop educational software packages to\nteach image processing techniques to\npeople who could then write more\neducational software!\nAll this effort was aimed at cutting\ndown on time and money consuming\nfieldwork, thus moving towards the\nextinction of the geologist! Colourful,\nglossy poster exhibitions complemented\nthe flashy computer simulations. Two researchers from Imperial College; QM Wang, and NP Vassos displayed their\nwork respectively on basin analysis in\nChina and mineral exploration in South\nAfrica. Liu Jian Guo and John M cM Moore of the Royal School of Mines\npresented a paper on image enhancement\nof gold alteration in south-east Spain.\nOther speakers came from America,\nRussia, the UK, France, Germany, Spain,\nChina and Sweden. Geologists spoke of\nover-active pattern recognition software\napplied to images to highlight faults,\nroads, fences, pipelines and anything else\nvaguely straight. Computer buffs spoke of\nnauseatingly user-friendly GIS which\nintegrated satellite images with geological\nmaps, geo chemical data, geophysical data\nand anything else they could lay their\nhands on!!\nBP, a co-sponsor, blew its own trumpet\ndeafening ly and splashed its new 'old'\ngreen logo all over the screens.\nThe stars of the three days were the\nRussians who told of their new methods\nfor forecasting onshore and offshore oil\nand gas. They talked of simply drawing\nconcentric circles around the locations of\nanomalous geo chemical samples. Where\nthese circles intersect turns out\nmiraculously to be the source of the\nanomaly. These circles can be thought of\nas spheres in three dimensions\u2014thus\nproviding a depth to the anomaly. The\ncrucial radius of the circles was calculated\nby 'complex mathematics'; the details of\nwhich were to be kept a secret, partly\ndue to the death of the leading scientist\nin a car crash.\nThey couldn't explain the findings and\nsimply explained that it worked in 70% of\ncases. Furthermore they had collaborated\nwith the famous mental spoon bender Uri\nGeller in a sort of 'oil divining'\nexperiment by testing his predictions of\nnew oil fields in Siberia, Stautsev and\nKarasev concluded their talk with the\nstate men 'so this method works well!'.\n\n"

    "content": "Before going to the clinic, Richard Eyers gets on his bike.\nCycling Revolution Imagine nearly 2000 cyclists all travelling\nin one direction between Battersea and\nTrafalgar Square, with traffic brought to a complete standstill. Well, at 2.15pm last\nSunday, that is exactly what happened.\nAn organisation called the 'London\nCycling Campaign' (LCC) gathered cyclists\nfrom all over London to meet in\nBattersea Park, and cycle to a rally in the\nshadow of Nelsons Column. The turnout\nwas excellent, and was obviously due to\nthe extensive advertising campaign that\nlead up to the event - if you have a bike\nanywhere in College, you probably found\na leaflet on it at sometime before Sunday.\nFor those of you who never saw the\nhandout, the rally had two purposes. The\nfirst is explained in the title 'Bike for a Breath of Fresh Air', which speaks for its\nself. There is definitely a pollution\nproblem in London, and the LCC wanted\nto highlight this. 'One in five people are\nseriously endangered by air pollution in London. For some pollutants, such as\nbenzene, there is no recognised safe\nlevel. Among those particularly at risk\nare children, pregnant women and the\nelderly.', states their leaflet in eye\ncatching red type, though sadly they have\nneglected to quote the source of this\ninformation.\nIf you would like to see the facts about\npollution (in London), 1 can recommend a recent article in the 'London Cyclist',\nNov/ Dec issue. Entitled 'Your Last\nGasp? Everything you always wanted to\nknow about vehicle pollution (but were to\nill to ask)', the feature runs through all\nthe possible products of vehicle exhausts.\nIt asks both how dangerous they are and\nwhat can be done to reduce their\nemission? It is not simply an attack on all\nnone cycle road users and makes some\nconstructive suggestions. It is well worth\na read, even for such knowledgeable\nscience students as those at IC,(apparently\nthere are a few!).\nThe second purpose of the rally was to\nget better conditions for cycling. Other\nthan improving the air quality in London,\n(the LCC concern themselves specifically\nwith this city), the LCCs main aim at the\nmoment is to see that their proposals for\na1000 mile network of cycle routes\nthroughout London are adopted as soon\nas possible. A plan which has apparently\nbeen taken up by the Department of\nTransport and the London Cycling Forum.\nSo What Happened In Battersea ?\nBetween mid-day and 2.15pm the\ncrowds of cyclists gathered in Battersea\nPark. It was refreshing to see such a variety of cycling 'types' in one place.\nThere were of course the stereo-type\n'racing enthusiasts' with their expensive\nbikes and thigh clinging lycra, but they\nwere in the minority. Ordinary cyclists\nwhose main interest is in using their\nbicycles to get from A to B( or maybe Z) were also strongly represented. It was\nextremely cold but entertainment by a brass ensemble and a skiffle group helped\nthe time to pass, as did a demonstration\nof stunt cycling by the world\nchampion,(at least I think that was his\ntitle).\nAt 2.15pm the hoards gathered to leave\nthe park, bikes of all descriptions were\nthen ridden out and across Chelsea\nbridge. The sight was an impressive one,\na steady stream of riders went all the\nway to Trafalgar Square. The Police were\nexcellent and traffic was brought to a complete standstill. One taxi did try to\njoin in (obviously in support of the\ncyclists!) but he was soon turned back.\nThere was some enthusiastic tooting of\nemphasis was on the fact that cycle traffic\nhas gone up 4 0 % in the last two years\nand cycle accidents have gone up by a quarter in one year. This he blamed,\npartly, at least, on the non-wearing of\nhelmets. It was later stated by another\nspeaker, that statistically, injuries would\nbe reduced far more if motorists and\npedestrians were to wear protective\nheadgear! Strangely enough mentions of\nPoll Tax from a minority in the crowd\nwas ignored.\nLabour M.P. Jeremy Corby n was far\nmore charismatic in his address, saying\nthat if three miles of motorway were\ncancelled then the cycle routes could be\nimplemented straight away, though he\nmade no offer of exactly where they\ncould all be put. He then went on to call\nfor limits on private car use in the Capital\nThe Campaign Banner Sported At Battersea Park\nhorns which were received by cheerful\nwaves, which must have infuriated those\ndrivers who were tooting because they\ncouldn't move for up to thirty minutes -lovely.\nTrafalgar Square - the speeches\nbegin.\nOnce in the Square we had to stand in\nthe cold for about forty minutes whilst\nvarious politicians said the same sort of\nthings, but with varying degrees of\nsuccess.\nFirst to address the masses was Roads\nMinister, Christopher Chope. He was\nclearly in favour of the LCC proposals'... too many cyclists are the innocent\nvictims of accidents we must now ensure the speedy implementation of the\n1000 mile network...' though his\nand for better public transport, all of\nwhich was of course popular.\nFinally the other speaker worth a mention was LCC chair Paul Gasson. He\nstated that although bikes were the\ntransport of the future, ' At present only\n4% of journeys in London are by bike\ncompared with up to 20% in some\ncontinental capitals'. He called for\npollution monitoring and the sealing off\nof the capital if levels become dangerous.\nThe rally in its self was undoubtedly a success, but it remains to be seen\nwhether the government can get its act\ntogether. Will they do what would benefit\nthousands of people, including cyclists, or\nwill the proposals become lost in the\ncurrent bout of 'who's going to be our\nleader?' that currently upsets the\ngovernment.\n\n"

    "content": "St\nFELIX\nMountain bike enthusiasts Colin and Liz discover the delights\nLake District Bik\nMountain biking is an activity fast\ngrowing in popularity in this country.\nCertainly a quick survey of bikes chained\nup around IC will show that increasing\nnumbers of people are rejecting thin slick\ntyres and drop handlebars in favour of\nchunky tyres, straight handlebars and\nnumerous gears\u2014the hallmarks of aMT B. But how many of these city dwellers\nactually jump on their mountain machines\nand head for the high hills for some real\noff-the-road terrain?\nColin and I decided to do just that.\nColin was already a keen mountain biker\nwith quite a bit of off-road experience as\nwell as being an experienced walker and\nclimber. I, on the other hand, am( or was)\na complete novice who hadn't ridden a bike for years and Iam also incredibly\nunfit. Gullibility is another of my traits,\nand with only a little arm twisting 1 was\npersuaded to purchase my very own MT B and to spend ten days pushing it up hills\nin the Lake District.\nDespite being only a very recent\naddition to the vast range of outdoor\nactivities, mountain biking's rise in\npopularity has been very noticeable and it has earned as many enemies as it has\nfans. Because of this, restrictions have\nquickly been introduced, only allowing\nmountain bikes on roads and bridle ways( which prevents them from being used on\nsome of the best off-road terrain and\nfrom reaching a lot of peaks). These\nrestrictions include open land as well as\nfootpaths as we discovered on a one in a million meeting with a National Park\nranger close to the top of Kinder Scot on\nour practice weekend in the Peak District.\nBecause bridle ways are few and far\nbetween, and vary considerably in\ncondition with an uncanny habit of\nending in the middle of nowhere, we purchased The Mountain Bike Guide\u2014by\nJeremy Ashcroft which was to become\nour Bible during our holiday. This handy\nlittle book describes routes and rates\nthem according to their difficulty (very\nsimilar to climbing guides).\nFrom this we selected five routes\nranging from easy to difficult, all fairly\nclose to Hawkeshead, which we made our\nbase.\nIt was raining when we set off from our\nrespective homes on the first morning\nwith our heavily overloaded bikes; it had\nstopped raining when we arrived, by\nsome freak of nature, on the same train\nand almost on time. All was well. Colin\nsaid that it was only four miles to\nHawkeshead if we went across the lake\non the ferry, an ugly cable-driven\nplatform that trundles to and fro across\nLake Windermere all day. It was more\nlike seven miles, and the hill up to Far\nSawrey nearly killed me. It started to rain\nagain: all was not so well. On arriving in\nHawkeshead we pitched our tent and\nwent to check the next day's weather\nforecast\u2014rain.\nOur enthusiasm was unabated and the\nnext morning we set off on our first ride:\nClaife Heights, the small hill which\nseparates the valley containing\nHawkeshead and Esthwaite Water from\nWindermere. This was the easy route,\nhowever the bridle way we chose to get\nonto the route was anything but. A humungous log-towing machine had been\nthrough and churned up the steep and\nuneven track, leaving huge puddles of\nthat wonderful substance which attracts\nmountain bikers like flies to a cow pat \u2014MUD.\nIf we were keen, full blooded fearless\nMTB'ers we would have ploughed on\nthrough and got completely plastered\nwith the stuff, but we weren't; we got off\nand walked round. When we did reach\nthe proper route, easy seemed too hard a description\u2014a smooth wide forest track\nwhich meant a very fast downhill run to\nthe shores of Lake Windermere where we stopped for lunch and laughed at the\npeople trying to water ski. Then we were\noff along the side of the lake to the road\nfrom the ferry and up the hill (which\nnearly killed me the previous day) to Far\nSawry. There we continued onto a bridle way which led up to open land on\nthe top of the hill where it became quite\nrocky which made the riding more\nchallenging.\nTo be successful at off-road cycling\nseveral techniques are needed to\novercome obstacles such as large stones,\nlogs, holes and ruts, while still going\nforward. Quite a mean feat when your\nlegs feel like jelly, you're gasping for\nbreath and sweat is pouring off every\nsquare inch of your body. All it took was\none extremely fit looking woman on the\nsame model of bike as me to go\nhammering past at top speed to totally\nof mud, mist and more.\ners\ndestroy my confidence. Nevertheless we finished the route in two hours (only half\nan hour more than the book said) and it\nwas back to the camp site for a Pasta\nChoice and an evening drying out in the\npub.\nThe next day we moved up a grade to\na moderate ride in Grizedale forest. This\nis an area popular with hire bikers as\nthere are clearly marked cycle routes\nalong smooth forest tracks. Our route,\nhowever, avoided these and went along a less-than-smooth bridle way which took us\nout of the forest, across the top of the hill\nand down to Coniston Water.\nToday's speciality as far as the weather\nwas concerned was wind, very strong\nwind. All attempts to ride along the\ngrassy track on the top ended with bike\nand rider sprawled on the ground.\nDespite being our longest actual route it\nwas fairly fast due to an eight mile blast\nalong the road beside the lake before a steep boggy bridle way back up through\nthe forest and then back down the road\nto Hawkeshead.\nThe next day the weather took a definite turn for the worse: it rained\nheavily. So we stayed in our little tent\nonly venturing out to visit the Beatrix\nPotter gallery and to cook our Vesta\nSweet and Sour chicken. Yummy. Now that our aching muscles had been\nrested for a day we were bright and\nbreezy, ready 'for an eight and a half mile\nride to the start of our route, this being\nthe Garburn Pass over the other side of\nWindermere to Hawkeshead. This\nmonth's issue of MBUK describes the\nGarburn Pass as totally ride able if you're\ngood. We weren't good enough and a fair\nbit of pushing was required up the pass\nwhich was quite steep and rocky. The rest of the route was ride able if\nsomewhat boggy. We were still full of life\nwhen we started on the eight and a half\nmiles back to the campsite. We w \u00ab re totally dead when we got there; twenty-five miles had definitely taken their toll,\nbut we were soon down at the pub\nplanning the next day's adventure.\nThis was the Wal na Scar Road (short\nversion), and it provided us with our first\nencounter with 'real' mountain bikers. Six\nof them appeared from nowhere as we were pushing our bikes un gracefully over\nsome rocks. Within seconds they were\nupon us all rippling muscles, expensive\nbikes and shades. 'Team Lemming' they\nwere called, and with a brief hello as\nthey passed they vanished over the\nhorizon leaving us feeling a mite\ninadequate.\nThe next two days were uneventful\nbecause one was Sunday which is, as\neveryone knows, a day of rest, so we only did ten miles\u2014to and from\nAmbleside for lunch. On the other day\nmy brakes failed, so we had to cycle to\nWindermere to the nearest bike shop to\nget a replacement. After that we made an\nabortive attempt to re-do Claife Heights\nbut the rain poured down and half-way\nround we gave up and tottered back to\nthe campsite much to my relief and\nColin's disgust.\nSt\nFELIX\nBy this time the bad weather had got\nto Colin and he was not quite his usual\nbright and sparkling self. I said 'don't worry it'll be lovely tomorrow: the sun\nwill shine and the birds will sing and all\nwill be hunk y dory'. And so it was.\nThe Wal na Scar Road is an old pack-horse road which leads up from Coniston\npast the OldMan and over a ridge south\nof Dow Crag, Buck Pike and Brown Pike.\nAt the top of the pass our route left the\nroad, going steeply down over boggy\nground, along a bridle way through to a road with a steep downhill section to the\nmain road back to Coniston. This was\ndefinitely the best route we did, no doubt\nhelped by the perfect weather, but it was challenging for my new found skills. The terrain varied from the rocky Wal na Scar\nRoad, to boggy grassland which is\nawkward to ride on but makes a soft\nlanding, to a narrow path in the forest\ninterspersed with slippery tree roots. The scenery was beautiful and my joyous\nmood could not even be broken by the\nfirst fall to draw blood. On arriving back\nin Hawkeshead we felt we thoroughly\ndeserved our meal in the pub.\nThe fact that the next day was just as\nnice made leaving and getting back to\nthe city all the harder.\nAlthough Imo an of the hell at the time\nit was a great holiday; rain, scars, bruises,\nPasta Choices, tiny tent, smelly socks and\nall. Mountain biking is hard work but the\neffort pays off; my fitness and skill\nimproved a lot over the holiday and I'm ready for more.\nBetween us we spent \u00a3200 on the\nholiday, most of this on food (and drink).\nCamping made it cheaper than staying in\na youth hostel or B&B but ten nights in a tiny tent was certainly my limit. Colin of\ncourse, coped magnificently; his riding\nwas brilliant, he never complained and he\nwaited for me all the time. Enough to put\nmere mortals like me to shame, but he\ndoes have a more expensive bike!\n15\n\n"

Without his presence IC still\nmanaged to win, in fact rather\nconvincingly, to leave Kings II with tears\nin their eyes. They were no match for\nthe superior IC team. R Muthoo chipped\nthe keeper beautifully from outside the\nbox to give IC the lead. C Gilmour made\nit 2-0 with a close range header. The\nsecond half saw the appearance of S Barry, the fragile centre-forward, who finished off two classy team moves with\nease. A biased ref was Kings' only\ndefence against the rampant IC. An excellent team performance was\nenhanced by debut right back A Anwar.

Initial intense\npressure led to Nick Millman taking IC's first corner. The box was packed, the\ntension high, but the corner seemed to be\ncurling in too close to the keeper, and\nthe cause seemed futile.\nPerhaps due to the chill wind blowing,\nor the imposing character of the 5th s, the\nopposition's keeper seemed to hesitate\nand then completely panic as he found\nhimself totally mus judging the cross. Phil,\nstanding just behind the said keeper,\ncollapsed in an a gon is ed heap, as the ball,\nto his innocent surprise, passed through\nthe goalie's hands, hitting him on the\nshoulder, to rebound into the net.\nFrom then on, IC felt justified in playing\nwith a certain air of complacency, almost\nto their regret. The opposition began to\npose more of a threat than was initially\nexpected, and it was only some good\ndefending that kept the score intact.\nHockey\nIC Ladies 1 - 0\nSouthgate Adelaide II\u20140\nThe Imperial College team was somewhat\napprehensive about playing on the\nSouthgate cabbage patch after the\ndelights of the Imperial astroturf.\nNevertheless the skills of Imperial were so\nfinely tuned that we still couldn't stop the\nball or even hit it!\nImperial miraculously managed to\nprevent the opposition from scoring.\nCongratulations must go to the Imperial\ndefence for being consistently strong\nthroughout.\nThe forward line was somewhat\nBadminton\nImperial College Badminton Club had a promising start to the U AU season,\nbeating Kent University at home in all\nthree matches.

The team, mainly made up of\nfresher s, were disappointed to win this\nway\u2014hopefully they will get a game next\ntime.\nThe IC ladies also had a comparatively\neasy win.

    "content": "Scribbler's Corner\nLETTERS\nAardvark\nDear FELIX,\nIt's time for aw hinge at the expense of\nSouthside Bar; for today I was nearly\nphysically expelled from the upper lounge\nfor merely closing a window.\nA group from the Orienteering Club\nwere sitting beside the windows in the\nupper lounge, enjoying some food from\nBelushi's after a hard training session.\nThis was until a man with a painted face\ncame and opened them all. (Without even\nasking us if we minded getting cold.) As\nyou would expect the outside air was\ncold and came straight in to attack us.\nVery shortly we all began to feel cold. I think it would have been warmer to have\nsat outside! Due to this I decided to close\nsome of the windows and stop the draft,\nand the waste of energy.\nWhen I was doing this the same\nstrangely painted man (?) approached me\nto leave them open. To this I explained\nthat it was cold and we wanted to stay\nwarm. Besides there was no one in the\ndisco yet getting incredibly hot due to\ngyrating their bodies to Bros. So I closed\nsome more windows, the chill air was\nnow staying where it should be, outside\nand away from me! I did however say\nthat I would re-open them when I left, or\nwhen the disco got going. Strangely I was\ntold that this was impractical. (I closed\nsome more windows.) Once he'd noticed I was informed that I'd be forcibly removed\nfrom Southside if 1 closed any more.\nI tried explaining in very simple words\nthat I was cold and the disco was empty,\nbut all to no avail. It was the House Rules\nthat decreed that the windows must be\nopen. He also told me that he 'didn't give\na shit how many people were downstairs'.\nIs this really the way in which to run\nSouthside with stuck-up dictators who\ncan't listen to reason? I don't think so. It\nis however a very Imperial College way\nof working.\nYours sincerely,\nShaun West, Orienteering Club\nSecretary.\nAardwolf\nDear Chris,\nI would like to express my complete\ndisgust at the insult directed at the Arab\npeople and at Athena's racist conclusion\nthat because a person's fia me is not Joe\nBloggs (or any other 'traditional' English\nsounding name) that he must be foreign.\nFor his information:\n\u2014I am English, born and bred\n\u2014I have not invaded any of HIS allies\n\u2014British universities are as much mine\nas HIS.\nIf all Athena could find wrong with my\nletter was my careless use of vocabulary,\nthen I hope he has learnt something from\nthe rest of it.\nIn future, I hope xenophobic bigots who\nwrite in stick to something they know a little bit about.\nSaleem Chowdhery.\nWhat'sOn AN UP-TO-THE-MINUTE GUIDE TO EVENTS\nIN AND AROUND IMPERIAL COLLEGE\nFRIDAY\nYacht Club Meeting 12.30pm Huxley 413.\nRag Meeting 12.40pm Union Lounge.\nFriday Prayers l.

Wait, it's Maidenl Must have\ncome on early so they could catch last\norders afterwards.\nSo, unfortunately, Iam unable to give\nmy considered opinion on the first two\nsongs. The favourite, Wrathchild, was\nnext in line, sounding as hard and raw as\never. They then proceeded to play the\nnew album, No Prayer For The Dying,\nbar about three songs, the title track, a Steve Harris number, being the most\nimpressive. A smattering of the tried and\ntested classics such as The Trooper and\nHallowed Be Thy Name were added to\ngood effect, but were too thin on the\nground for my liking. They even left out\nRunning Freel\nThroughout the set, Harris' bass lines\nthumped out the rhythm, the strings\nstriking the frets giving an almost\npercussive effect.

The\nensuing verbal battle was academic, for\non this occasion, Godflesh were well\nbelow their usual bowel-thrashing\nstandard. The pounding rhythm seemed\nrepetitive and hollow, and the stage\nempty after L7's over-am ped guitar\nfrenzy. Only towards the end of the set,\nafter the addition of a second guitarist,\ndid they seem to get into their stride with\nLike Rats and Pulp. Even the multitudes\nof crusty's seemed disappointed.\nAfter Godflesh, a remarkably strange\nchoice of support, L7's trashy overload\ncould be only be topped by Nirvana's immense opening. Powered by the nine\nfoot human pogo, Chris, on bass and a solid driving beat, the rhythm section was\nrock solid and provided a perfect\nbackdrop for Kurdt's superhuman efforts\nat what used to be a two man job.\nWith the demise of Mudhoney, Nirvana\npredecessor Adrian Smith, seemed to\nenjoy himself, clambering over the amp\nstacks, and was nearly up to the standard\nof his counterpart, Dave Murray. Nicko\nMcBrain performed admirably on the\nskins, as always, while Bruce Dickinson\nscreamed, hissed and growled (in tune,\nmost of the time) from start to finish.\nThe stage set was hardly as lavish as\nexpected, although a ten foot Eddie (see\nany album cover, you non-believers) did\nappear during the song Iron Maiden.\nBruce kindly refrained from kicking it's head in and tearing out it's brains as he\ndid a few short years back.\nThey seem to be going back to their\nroots, dispensing with the lavish and\nexpensive effects.

Snell\nBored! are from Australia and I'm going\nto say they sound like ACDC anyway. Bet\nthat has pissed them off. There is more to\nit than that.

The bass is good and\ntwang y and is tuned to within an inch of\nbeing a didgeridoo on Sweef Charity.\nBeneath this neo-punk exterior lurks a definitely Hendrix rooted guitar style.\nThis is refreshing in contrast to the\ngrinding bits, but you have to choke on\nyour own vomit to get away with over\ntwo minutes of feedback at the end of a track, the Final Solution.\nThe production is not obtrusive and\nincludes a variety of fade-in styles from\nsmooth and slow to John Peel. The\noverall sound is probably too dirty for a wide market, sounding downright live.\nAll the tracks get a general 'Yeah',\nexcept, maybe, Satellite, which is a Pistols\ncover and unnecessary. I would just like\nto be the last person in this review to say\nthe title of the last number. Motherfuckin'\nMotherfucker.\nMungo\nAstoria 24.10.90\nwere set to take the lead in the sub-pop\nset. However they are at present looking\nfor a deal with the majors 'for\ncommercial reasons'. Sell out or not, their\nnew single does not indicate a lowering\nof standards. The new sound is mellower\nbut more diverse and shows a new side\nto the band.\nTonight, Chris was as tall as the stacks,\nand Kurdt's clean guitar cut through the\nsludge left by Godflesh's Neanderthal set.\nIf audience reaction were to be a measure of greatness, Nirvana are truly\ngods. Old favourites Love Buzz, Negative\nCreep and Paper Cato were interspersed\nbetween the newer, mellower songs. All were received with wild stage-diving as\nthe bouncers tried to stem the tide.\nThe encore proved the worth of the\nnew single as is slipped in easily with the\nmonster Scool, whittled down to crucial\nriffs and crushing. Nirvana have\nmellowed, but still shred.\nSeb\nRobert Riley &\nthe Buffalo Club\nGone Too Long 12\"\nThis band have a stupid name. That is all\nthere is to say, apart from that the lyrical\nstyle is sadly somehow familiar, the piano\nsupport something from aTV theme. Sod,\nI don't even like this country drivel about\nhow sad some blok e is, bugger\nobjectivity.\nMungo8 "

    "content": "Bullseye IM mmm. Just my luck. My first\nreview for Felix, and it's a bit of a tough y( Fnarrr). It's hard to say what the\nwhole point of it is. The plot revolves\naround two over the hill villains (Michael\nCaine and Roger Moore) who are the\nnear perfect doubles of two (successful!)\ncold fusion scientists (Michael Caine and\nRoger Moore), and a great deal of money.\nIn style, the whole thing seems to be a tribute to the British comedy movies of\nthe sixties, complete with na ff film\nquality, na ff dialogue, na ff effects and na ff jokes. They even seem to have gone so\nfar as to use what appears to be a ridiculously low budget. On top of this\nthe film is overly long, especially in the\nmiddle parts, which end up dragging\nhorribly.\nHowever, the end does come together\nmuch better than you'd expect, and even\nmanages to keep a fair level of tension, despite the fact that you know what's REVIEWS\ngoing to happen, and some gratuitous\ncruelty to pigeons! Mr Caine is humorous\nin his typical bumbling way, and Mr\nMoore is at last beginning to show his\nage (all of it), which serves him right.\nSome light relief for all the sex-starved IC\nmales is provided in the form of Deborah\nBarrymore as a young CIA agent who\nmay or may not be the daughter of one\nof the heroes, and the farcical treatment\nof the British and American intelligence\n(?) agencies is brilliantly done (Yes, OK,I admit it: I like the Carry on... movies!).\nSo, if you're old enough to remember the\noriginal films this will probably invoke a pleasant sense of nostalgia. If you're not,\nthen it's a gentle way to waste a couple\nof hours and a fiver, but it's probably\nmore sensible to wait for the video, get\nsome beers in and invite a few friends\naround for a laugh.\nAlien Sex Fiend.\nThe Maids Flatliners Tragedy\nIWritten nearly four hundred years\nago this is a tail of love lost,\ndeception, adultery and death. In total\nfour people die, all stabbed and two self\ninflicted. The plot is too complicated to\ngo into in the space available but its\nthemes of sexual frustration and intrigue\nare as relevant now as when it was\nwritten.\nThe quality of the acting was superb\nthroughout, no character shone above the\nothers and overall it was a very\nprofessional and charismatic performance.\nThe set was def in at ly designed with a heavy minimalist ic slant, const is ting of\nthree chairs, a table and a bed there was\nnothing for the actors to hid behind.\nFor a play written just after the\nShakespearean period the language is\nvery 'quaint' but the clothing and the set\ncontrast against this being a mixture of\nboth modern and 30's styles.\nEntertaining and thought provoking, it\nis very much worth a look but you\nhaven't got long. 'The Maid's Tragedy'\nplays at the Battersea Art Centre,\nLavender Hill, Battersea until the 18th November. Concessions are \u00a3 3 ,\nmembership is \u00a35 per annum. The box\noffice is on 071-223 2223.\nIan Hodge.\nFilm Choice\nGoodfellas, The little Mermaid,\nGhost, A Shock to the System, Bad\nInfluence.\nFive medical students take life, and\ndeath, in their hands in a macabre\nexperiment exploring the limits of\nknowledge. One by one they submit\nthemselves to a near death experience,\ncontrolled by their colleagues.\nUnfortunately the experience does not\nend when they are returned to the living;\ntheir sins come to haunt them, causing\nviolence and pain.\nThe students each have their dark\nsecrets (obviously) but they vary in their\n'sinfulness'. It is understandable that\nkilling somebody could produce guilt\nfeelings that take on a supernatural form.\nIt is less clear why the act of opening a forbidden door and startling your father,\njust before he dies on the road, should\nhave the same chilling effect. Also, what\nis so sinful about home videos?\nThe answer may lie in the assertion\nthat there is no absolute scale against\nwhich to measure a 'sin'. The measure\nmay be your own conscience, in which\npetty misdemeanors may become heinous\ncrimes. Does this mean that a cold\nblooded killer will not be tormented, or\nwill a childhood act produce misery\nbeyond the grave?\nIt is a credit to the film that it gives\ntime over to reflecting on these points\nthroughout the story, in passages that\ncould be construed as tedious in any\nother production. One catches oneself\nthinking 'What if?' as indiscretions well up\nfrom the dark corner of the mind that\nyou thought you had locked.\nThe only quibbles I have with this film\nare the use of clich es such as the climax\noccurring on halloween and the lame and\nunbelievable ending. This, I feel, was\nconcocted to leave the audience with a feeling of well being, instead of having to\nleave the cinema feeling depressed and\nunlikely to recommend the film, which,\nincident ly,I do.\nToby Jones.\n\n"
