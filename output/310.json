    "content": "Page 2\nFELIX Thursday, 9th March, 1972\nBRISTLY\n24 HOURS\n3 a.m. changeover.\n\"Who's out on 6, Denise?' '\n\"John.\"\n\"O.K. He's coming round.\"\nHere he comes, going well, that light's bright, five yards,\nhere we go, move, RUN, grab the bar, John's out, jump in, quick,\ngrab the steering, feet on pedals, he's pushing, now PEDAL. And\naway we go for another quarter-of-a mile lap at the Bristol 24\nHours Pedal Car Race.\nThis year there were three I.C. entries for the Seventh National\nPedal Car Race at Whitchurch airfield. There was 'Big Bo', the\nCity and Guilds big (Class II) car with 21 in. wheels as well as\nthe well-tried 'Little Bo', a Class I car with 14 in. wheels. Mines\nwere using an old Guilds frame for their 'Strikalite', a gallant\nfirst attempt at the Class I event.\nAlthough Pedal Car design is tending to settle down along\nfairly standard lines, there were a few beautiful exceptions\u2014\nthose that spring to mind were 'Snow White', a sort of bleached\nmobile rowing machine, 'Battle Wagon', which probably heavily\noutweighed all three I.C. cars together, 'Adge' a diminutive product\nof the University of Bristol Scrumpy Appreciation Society, and\n'Oomeegooiie\", a Class I dragster design which subsided to\nMother Earth after a couple of laps. Somebody was even propelling\na mobile bath.\nThere were probably as many competitive cars as ever this year.\nSouthampton had a good couple of cars, and there were several\nother fast entries. Hele's School were back again with a fearfully\nwell-drilled pair of teams and cleverly designed stumpy cars.\nThe race started at 3 p.m. on Friday with the usual 'Le Mans'\ntype start, with the course damp but no rain falling. By the time\nthat crash helmets were removed at 3.30 p.m., 'Big Bo' was going\nwell at about 1\u00a3 minutes a lap, 'Little Bo' at just under 2 minutes,\nand Mines had started.\nLights, front and rear, were fitted by six o 'clock, by which time\nit was fairly clear how the race was going. The Hele's School\npeople were opening up a sizeable overall lead in Class II, and\ntheir performance was a joy (if exasperating) to watch. Their\nposit on in the cars was really crouched over the steering wheel,\nand their change-overs were done at a sprint. 'Little Bo' was\nleading Class I, and Mines were beginning to become evident in\nthis class. 'Big Bo' was being pushed hard, Rob Matthews lap-m*mm mm i \u2022 \u2022\nping as fast as Heles, but as the night continued their lead opened-up.\nSleep, or rather resting, was started at 12.30 a.m., with one\nmember of each Guild team dozing for an hour while the other\nfive kept pedalling. I do not think that anyone slept properly with\nthe continuous rattle of Phil Smyth and Pedal Cars in the back-ground. It was about this time that Big Bo's crankshaft came adrift\nand had to be re-welded (for the first time). All this time Little\nBo and Strikalite (rather far down the pits so we didn't see\nmuch of the Minesmen) kept pushing on in their class.\nDawn found us blinking hard, though neither hungry nor completely exhausted. By this time, after 15 hours of pedalling, it\nwas virtually impossible to remember any existence other than\npedalling. There was not as much \"bump in' and bor in'\" as there\nhad been earlier in the race, and although we were fairly tired\nby this time Denise and Judy were keeping us very well nourished with Butties, Sausages and Eggs. We could not have continued without them and Phil Smyth.\nPHOTO Q RaP Hy FELIX STYLE After the success of the Felix 'Hi Fi' review (Felix No. 306)\nand rumours of literary I.C. students due to reading the Theatre\nReview (Felix No. 307), we now bring you the next instalment of\n\"How to spend your grant in a few hours\"\u2014the Felix review of\nPhotography.\nI will deal with the first part of the process for still photography\n\u2014the Camera. Cameras vary from the simplest cartridge loading\nin st amati c type camera to the Hasselblad system cameras\u2014prices\nranging from around E2 to around \u00a3600 for just the camera. The\ncamera consists basically of a light-tight box with a lens to focus\nlight onto film inside the light-tight box; a shutter between lens\nand film to allow the light to strike the film for a measured time\nand a viewfinder to see how much will be obtained in the picture.\nBy noon the main prizes were as good as won. The Hele's cars\n'Claudette' and 'Cleo' looked unbeatable and had been running\nalmost continuously since the start. In Class I, Little Bo had a very big lead, with Strikalite a very probable second. By this\ntime the course was well dried out, and the dust (or whatever it\nwas) was just beginning to affect people. It was also becoming\nincreasingly clear that the Handicap (judged on a computation\nof Laps and Wheel sizes) would be very close between No. 1\n(Claudette) and Little Bo. Hele's team manager was working his\nteam harder and harder, and Little Bo was lapping well. The -last\nhour of the race was fought desperately, with the handicap at\nstake, and in Little Bo we were slaying ourselves. Big Bo was\neven used to trail Little Bo and ram it from behind to get it up\nthe hill faster.\nThankfully the race finished promptly at 3 p.m. with all our cars\nm in full flow. There was a great deal of pain being caused by the\nabnormal conditions ('Mystery Rays Hit 120' said The Sunday\nPeople, '200 Burnt at Car Race' said The Times), and after Phil\nSmyth collected the Class I prize and the Minesmen their RunnersUp prize, or ft went most of us to Bristol Eye Hospital. Apparently\nthere is going to be a Public Inquiry into the causes of the eye\nand face troubles. And that was that. If there is a moral to be\ndrawn design wise, it is that simplicity and reliability count for\nmore than speed. Little Bo stopped only once in 24 Hours for\nmore than one minute, and the Mines car also kept going con-tin u ou sly. Teams\nGuilds\u2014HQ:\u2014Phil Smyth, Hugh Hatton, John Baird, John Doerr,\nDenise, Judy, Caroline. Pedallers:\u2014Rob Matthews, Alan Ponsford,\nMalcolm Seeley, Parry Davis, Chris Marshall, Dave John, Keith\nReynish, Pete Wilkins, Stewart Moult, John Coxon, Bob Carter,\nMalcolm Newman.\nMines\u2014HQ:\u2014Joe Sheeply, Dave Easterbrook (+ Mandy), Jack\nMinerevski, Paul Gee. Pedallers:\u2014Alan Swannell, Richard Wilson,\nMalcolm Fowler, Rupert and Rod.\nClass I \u20141st Little Bo, 2nd Strikalite.\nHele's School, Exeter won the overall event with 938 laps,\n(approx. 1,010 on H 'Cap), Little Bo did approx. 1,048 on H 'Cap,\nso Little Bo won overall on the Handicap. And each member of\nLittle Bo's team completed roughly 42,000 actual pedal movements.\nAnd we all got very, very tired.\nT*> Mf ^ j L \u00abt \u00bb\n- - lT*e* e,v/I>< Taking the three features of the camera in reverse order, the\nviewfinder system may be simply two apertures in the camera\nbody such that when the eye is close to one, the light passing\nthrough both shows the picture size; or, on more expensive\ncameras, lenses are substituted for plain glass, and more accurate\nindication of picture size. These methods are rather crude, in that\n\u2022|i. Bfl i mm\nthe viewfinder only shows picture size, nothing else. One refinement is the Twin Lens Reflex (TLR) cameras. In this the viewfinder lens is linked to the main lens, and by a ground glass\nscreen, the focusing of the object, as well as picture size, is\nindicated. No matter where the camera is used, there will be a parallax between what the film sees and what the eye sees. This\nis resolved by the single Lens Reflex (SLR).\nThe SLR has a mirror which is placed between lens and film\nwhen not exposing film, which is at an angle such that it reflects\nlight onto a screen. This means that the eye sees, through the\nviewfinder, exactly what the picture sees\u2014focused or un focused, light or dark. Obviously, this costs a lot more.\nShutters are mostly of good quality\u2014a range from 1/30th to\n1/500th and B( time exposure) is adequate for most conditions\nproviding there is flash synchronization.\nThe lens is the most important part of the camera and also\none of the most complex\u2014and, of course, a large part of the\ntotal cost. The data about lenses can be baffling\u2014apertures,\nfocal lengths, etc.\nThe aperture is a measure of how wide the lens is compared\nto its focal length\u2014consequently how much light will be let\nthrough. Instamatic type cameras may have an aperture of about\nf8( lens area 1 /8th of focal length of lens), while a Nikon or\nPentax may have an f1.4 lens.\nWith SLR cameras, the lenses are interchangeable, with a stand-dard lens fitted and telephoto or wide angle lenses available\u2014at\nsome cost, of course!\nTo buy a camera, one of the vital things is to decide just how\nmuch can be afforded, then what type of camera is wanted\u2014SLR,\nTLR, rangefinder or simple type with no adjustments. After deciding\nthe camera type, the lens is the next decision\u2014what focal length\nand aperture. Another important feature is film size. 35 mm is\nundoubtedly the most popular format\u201424 x36 mm, but for high\nquality enlargements 6 x6 cm (120) is much better, although\ncosting more for film yet less for the camera. If colour transparencies are wanted, then 35 mm is the best format\u2014both for\nfitting most projectors\u2014and also cost wise! Useful accessories depend upon the camera\u2014although a flash\nunit is the most useful and universal access ary. The best sort\u2014\nto my mind\u2014are electronic flash guns powered by rechargeable\ncells; these have a higher initial cost but almost zero operating\ncost. Otherwise, penlight cell operated electronic flash guns are\ngood (see Felix flash photos!) but the cells need changing fairly\noften and tend to corrode slowly.\nA light meter, for cameras with variable apertures without a built-in meter, is almost vital\u2014the best being Weston Master\nlight meters \u2014the current one is model V but III and IV are just\nas good, and I and II are good, old looking and rather cheaper!\nIn general Japanese equipment is of high quality, yet rather\nexpensive. German equipment is good but as expensive as, or\nsometimes more expensive than, the Japanese equivalent. One of\nthe cheapest makes\u2014although good quality makes\u2014are the Russian Zenith range. These are not flashy cameras, but they take\ngood photographs and can take knocks well\u2014they are built like\ntanks! The reason why they are so cheap is that they are state\nsub sidi sed. If anyone has enough money, the best camera, to my mind, is\na Hasselblad, the basic cost being about \u00a3386.57. The whole\nHasselblad system is top quality\u2014this being the make used by\nNASA on the moon.\nAs a good second best, brand new, 35 mm format, but from\njust as good a make is the Nikon F2 Photomic\u2014a cool \u00a3297.25\u2014\nbut good enough for a lifetime's photographs.\nFor Photographic materials\u2014films, papers, etc., the cheapest\nsource is through the Photsoc. Shop c/oR. Jenner, Selkirk 472.\n\n"

The ways in which we considered it would help are: I) to encourage others to put up their names so that we would knowhow to plan the campaign and II) to discourage some people from standing. As we realise, in retrospect, that this manoeuvre could be misconstrued as an attempt at election rigging, we must point out that this is not the case, nor was ever intended.

M.W addington Dear Mr Sugden, As you are now well aware, I attempted to place a nICU presidential manifesto in FELIX, whereas I had no intention of standing. As always in an elaborate hoax something went wrong, and you found out. Basically this was an advertising stunt, whereby I hoped to get more people interested in the elections. As a result of the confusion that my denial of standing for president would cause, I hoped that many students might take an active part in the elections. My hoax was totally unrelated to am gr other persons manifesto which you are printing, but I hoped that it would be beneficial to ICU as a whole. I realise that this has cai a sed the staff of FELIX some problems as the a rtica e. was actually typeset before the hoax was discovered. I hope that you will accept my sincere apology for the extra work I have caused, and my offer top py for the costs involved in changing the page.( Eds note this has not been done). Yours sincerely, W.A. Gerrard. Note? Chris Sheppard has asked us to make it clear that his article in FELIX was not submitted as a manifesto and is not intended as such. It is, he says, purely a personal opinion of one aspect of the College. His manifesto will be published at a later date. "

    "content": "Page 6 FELIX Thursday, 9th March, 1972\n\"JUMPERS\" \u2014 Michael Hordern and Diana Rigg in an\narrow ing tale.\nEven now I cannot really make up my mind about\nTony Richardson's new production of 'The Threepenny Opera' (Prince of Wales). Bertholt Brecht used\nthe main story of John Gay's eighteenth century 'The\nBeggar's Opera' as the basis for this politically orientated Ballad Opera, and despite the length of time\nsince writing (1928 or so) much of the flavour of\nBrecht's convictions still comes through strongly.\nBlind Capitalism is much the same in Seventies Britain as in Twenties Berlin.\nThere is a great deal that is\nvery effective in this production,\nKurt Weill wrote the original\nmusic that consists largely of\nsleazily dreamy melodies in the\nJazz style of the Twenties (the\nplay is set in Soho in about\n1925), and the tunes are finely\nevocative. The set consists\nlargely of a macabre Merry-GoRound in a loosely defined junkyard environment\u2014corrugated\niron proliferates. And the whole\ntone is downbeat as we are led\nthrough the Brechtian Underworld. Joe Melia is very good\nas the gangster Macheath (\"All\nMacheath has/Is his flick-knife/\nAnd he keeps it/out of sight\")\nand Vanessa Redgrave is entertaining as his Polly Peachum.\nThe best singing comes from an\nextraordinary menacing Annie\nRoss as the Whore Jenny\u2014in\nfact all the acting is first class.\nBut, I am sorry to say, there\nis, inherently, a certain coherence lacking in the show. We\nare rather used to Musicals in\nwhich the songs-arise out of the\naction as smoothly as possible,\nbut here the ballads are kept\ndistinctly separate as the actors\ncome downstage, sing their\nsong, and the broken action is\nresumed. The production is, as I PLAYS\nhave said, good, but in such a variety of ways that it makes\nthe whole business very 'bitty'.\nThe 'ensemble' feeling is not\nthere.\nBut given the original material I do not really see how this\nproduction could have been improved upon, and the standard\nsocial points come across well.\nMost impressive of all was Lon\nSatton's sinister Narrator snarling his way through \"The Ballad\nof Mack the Knife\" with the clos-ing, poignant words \"You can\nspot those/In the limelight/\nThose in darkness/You don't see\".\nI could not get to \"The Balcony\" (Royal Shakespeare Company, Aldwych), so I sent Another. From what I have gathered from him, the play (by Jean\nGenet) is very bizarre (some-thing about illusions being\nworked out in a brothel!), and\nthe excellent acting creates a powerful atmosphere. My sister\ndid not like it\u2014so it sounds\nvery much a matter of taste.\nHave fun folks.\nREVIEWS MUSIC\nTHE STRAW BS\" GRAVE NEW WORLD\"( A&M) The concepts of \"Folk-Rock\" and \"Electric Folk\"\nhave been bandied about so much in the last couple\nof years (every time a reviewer got his hands on an\nalbum by Fairport Convention, Steeleye Span or the\nStrawbs) that this sort of music has come to be accepted as a form of music in itself, like folk or rock. But\nelectronic folk? Very freaky. A bit like kippers and\ncustard, quite acceptable separately (if you've got\nnothing else) but not together, etc., etc.\nOn this album Dave\nCousins and co. prove\notherwise. Their electronics don't have the brute \" \" \" ^ \u2022 \" \u2022 \" \u2022 \" ^\nforce of the Soft Machine down to the ground, es-or the spacey quality of the pec i ally as his replacement\nPink Floyd but they will Blue Weaver is playing the\ndoubtless surprise you all same instruments Wakethe same. Apart from being man now uses with Yes.\nthe best album the Strawbs Although his roots are in\nhave made, \"Grave New folk Dave Cousins can\nWorld\" shows that \" nice\" blow a mean electric gui-Olde Worlde lyrics sound tar (on \"Tomorrow\") and\ngood when played over a at other times they can\nreverse tape backing or play in an Indianesque\nany other musical backing (what a ghastly word \u2014 I for that matter. I wonder just thought it up) style\nwhy it was that Rick Wake- with sitar and tabla s, or\nman left the group. He with a string arrangement\nhated folk, he said, but so provided by the mellotron\nmany styles are in corp or or even with a brass band\na ted here I think the music (The Robert Kirby Silver\nwould have suited him Band and Tony Visconti's Old Tyme Dance Orchestra) or with just acoustic\nguitar accompaniment \u2014\nsongs on which the\nStrawbs built their re put a tion.\nThat's the music then,\nand now for the words.\nThis is yet another concept\nalbum and the title track is\na rather despairing protest\nsong, very depressing,\nwith Dave Cousins grunting \"May you rot in your\ngrave New World' (clever\npun, what) as if with his\ndying breath. Not all the\nsongs are so morbid but I think the general idea is\nthat things now aren't what\nthey used to be and God\nknows what they'll be like\nin the Future. It also seems\nto represent a journey, as\nthe first line of the first\nsong, \"Benedictus\" is \"The\ntraveller has far to go\" and\nthe last track is called\n\"The Journey'sEnd\". \"Benedictus\" could be a song for progressive\nchurches to adopt to attract the younger genera-tion; the tune reminds me\nof a hymn but as I haven't been to church for a while\nI couldn't say which one.\n\"Ah Me Ah My\" features\nTony Hooper on vocals,\nbacked by Tony Visconti'sO.T. D.O. and I can imagine\nMaurice Chevalier doing\nthis one. \"I'd like to live on\na farm again like I did for\npart of the war/I 've got a few happy memories\nthough we were rather\npoor\". Mon Dieu!\nSome people may dismiss this album, with its\nheavy religious overtones,\nas the most pretentious\nrubbish since \" Jesus\nChrist Superstar\" (see\nJERUSALEM) but I don't. My only regrets are that I missed the Strawbs' recent\ntour\u2014these numbers must\nsound great when performed live \u2014 and also\nthat I am only borrowing\nthis record because I couldn't get it off the\nrecord company. The al-bum, by the way, comes in\na nifty thrice-folding package and the booklet with\nthe lyrics is illustrated with\na medieval art form which\nI can't name but which I rather like.\nWill there be room in the\nNew World for The\nStrawbs? I hope so.\nFILMS In the beginning there was the 'Jazz Singer', films\nhad found a voice and the first thing they did was to\nsing. Singing and music has been featured in many\nhundreds of films since then.\nThen came rock 'n' roll and\nwe saw the gyrations of 'Elvis'\nin 'Love Me Tender' (1956) a very old story with songs, this\nwas the first in a long string of\nvery, very trite films (the notable exception being the intelligent 'Change of Habit',\nnever released over here but\nshown on television last sum-mer). There were other socalled 'pop' films featuring many\nartists and groups which were\njust show cases to promote their\nlatest LP (the only exception\nbeing the Beatles' films which\nwere much more different from\nthe standard pop film). The\nmid-sixties saw the vogue for\ncinema-ve rite. The first films\nwere 'A Hard Day's Night' (al-though there was a large\namount of fiction involved in\nthe film) and Pennebaker's 'Don't Look Back'\u2014a factual\ndocumentary of Dylan's tour of\nBritain in 1965 which was very\ngood and very perceptive. Pennebaker was also responsible\nfor the first 'Pop Festival' film\nwith 'Monterey Pop' which, I understand, is the best of the\nFestival films\u2014more than that I can't say, but Michael Wadleigh's 'Woodstock' is the festival film that everyone has heard\nof\u2014an easily likeable film; the\nsheer grandeur of seeing the\n200, 300, 400 or 500 thousand\nin the audience is certainly a we inspiring \u2014I tend to get the\nsame feeling when seeing any\nfilm with 'a cast of thousands',\nbut I also tend to get the feeling\nof isolation\u2014I want to know\nwhat the people in the middle\nof it all think about the situ a tion, there was no point of identification in the film\u2014there was\nno one person or group of persons with whom I could identify\n\u2014but 'Gimme Shelter', this was\nthe best of the bunch. I hope\nthat some enterprising cinema\nowner runs 'Gimme Shelter'\nand 'Woodstock' in one pro-gram me. In 'Gimme Shelter' we\nsee the reaction of one group\n(i.e. the Hell's Angels) to a 'Woodstock' type situation (i.e. free concert, large gathering,\naggressive music) and the result is very, very terrifying.\nThe next film is the latest in\nthe genre and to me perhaps\none of the worst of the films,\nI 've been looking at. 'JIMi\nPLAYS BERKELEY' is shoddy.\nIt neither makes any point nor\nsays anything, other than Hendrix was a great musician and\nI doubt whether many people\nwould disagree with that. The\nfilm is a rip-off, a deliberate attempt to cash in on Hendrix's death. The film lacks any artistic\nmerits, being a very average\nfilm of one of his concerts with\nsome stock footage of riots in\nBerkeley. The music played was\ngood and this version of 'The\nStar-Spangled Banner' was better than that in 'Woodstock',\nmainly because it had a very\ngood close-up of him playing it\n(in fact the camera work was\nvery static). But overall it lacked\ntaste and I doubt whether Hendrix himself would have allowed\nthe film to be released if he\nwere alive.\nwo iv show/n g PARAMOUNT LOWER REGENT STREET 839.6494\n\n"

    "content": "Thursday, 9th March, 1972 FELIX Page 5\nTRAVELLING IN TIME One Tuesday in February, it was my intention to visit the Travel Bureau. By\nThursday I had found the evasive Room 216, College Block. Strange really as it\nis right next to the J. C.R., although at the end opposite to the bar.\nPerhaps I was unfair to have preconceived ideas about what I hoped to find on\narrival but I had them just the same. They were, almost exclusively, wrong.\nFor instance, the word 'Bureau' must conjure up images of bespectacled and\nrespectable, if austere, ladies waiting to process every customer in an exactly similar fashion. That, to them would be efficiency. Instead, on arrival, I was unable\nto discover who was customer and who was 'Travel Bureaucrat',without asking\nall present.\nThere are no paid staff running the bureau and it is manned by students.\nWhen I said I was only there to watch a look of relief spread over an otherwise\nbewildered face of the only student of the Travel Bureau to have arrived thus far.\nHe immediately averted his attention to the first of the eight people waiting for\nassistance.\nThe first two customers required NUS cards which were duly unearthed from the\nfiling cabinet (which only looked tidy when closed), stamped and had the photos\nattached.\nThe third customer wanted more information concerning the buses to Leeds\nwhich had been advertised in a recent Felicity. So did the fourth customer. As did\nthe fifth. And the sixth. And the seventh.\nPolitely, but with fatigue in his voice, the travel man explained that although buses\nleave Leeds every weekend for London, at \u00a31.50 return, the London to Leeds run\nis not due to start till October. October. October.\n'Really, we are not geared to deal with travel within the UK' said the travel man\nhoping, by informing me to stem the flow, 'British Rail will not give us booking\nfacilities so we advise everyone to go to their main line station in London for\nmore information'.\n'Come October, though,' (he cheered visibly), 'there should be coaches book-able here to Leeds, Bath, Bristol, Manchester, Liverpool, Exeter, Nottingham, Birmingham, York and more, come October. October. October.\nBy this time, two more travel men had arrived and were dealing with the customers who were coming in. One undergrad wanted to know more about working\nholidays in Israel on Kibbutzim and, by chance, the travel man was able to relate\nfirst hand information. The student wandered off looking contented saying he would\nbe back with his cheque book.\nThe rest of business consisted of travel on the continent and people applying\nfor International Student Travel Cards.\n'I want to go to Athens two days after term ends and return from Rome to\nParis in the first week of April \u2014 can you book it for me?'\n'Yes, I 'll fill in the forms and if you pay 25% of the fare you can collect the\ntickets this time next week'.\nSomehow it didn't seem possible that this trio, only one of whom had arrived\non time, could be responsible for getting people from almost anywhere in Europe\nand beyond, to anywhere else.\n'We got 5% commission and return this to the students who travel'. Amazing.\nPerhaps they would be better advised to retain it and equip the room with a desk\ncounter and even a part-time employee.\nBut somehow the atmosphere would be lost. If any atmosphere can be created\nin a room as soulless as Room 216, College Block it is worth retaining.\nFor European, Russian, North African, Western Asian travel, the Travel Bureau\nis ideal.\nFor American travel and all other countries of the world, the Bureau has the\nname of an organization known to be respectable and who, next year or the\nfollowing year, will hopefully endow the bureau with booking facilities. As yet, direct\nbooking with the organization by the student is the form.\nWhile in Room 216, it is also possible to fix up travel insurance with Endsleigh\n(which is run by a part-time employee).\nAt 2.15 my visit to Room 216, College Block was at an end. The 'treasurer' came\nin and took away the cheques of the day, the booking forms, NUS cards and\nphotos were put in an envelope to be sent to the bureau's agent, the bump h was\nall tipped into the filing cabinet to be disinterred the following Tuesday and USK Travel Bureau had ended another day of business.\nII\nTRAVEL Air fares examples : -LONDON to ATHENS\nHELSINKI\nOSLO\nMADRID FRANKFURT\n99\n99\n99\n99\n\u00a322 single\n\u00a323 single\n\u00a317.20 single\n\u00a314 single\n\u00a39.65 single\nSpecial Tours\nLAPLAND\nand\nMOROCCO\nBoth Overland\nTUESDAY AND THURSDAY12 p.m., ROOM216 COLLEGE BLOCK N.U.S. and I.S.

    "content": "SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY - A IEW COURSE Chris Sheppard\nFor the past six months the Industrial Sociology Unit has been working in close\nconjunction with I.C.U. Academic Affairs Committee to prepare a completely new\ncourse in' Science, Technology and Society'. The course has been devised in response to expressions of an increasing awareness among students, academics\nand practitioners in the various fields of sci nee and technology of the need\nto emphasise in courses of study the social and personal consequences of the\nactivities of scientists and technologists. The overriding objective of the\ncourse, therefore, is to help students to become more aware of, and personally concerned with the nature and wider implications of science and technology,\nthrough an educational experience related to their felt needs.\nFrom its inception students have been involved in the preparation of the course,\nand it is the needs of students that have been of prime consideration, throughout.\nThe course has gained 'academic approval' from the Board of Studies. The College,\nhew, remains as non-committal as ever, the Rector saying that times are hard\nand refusing to give it any real support. The College seems totally unmoved by\nthe fact that a number of academics, both within the college and outside, have\nshown tremendous interest in the course (both Physics and Ele c. Eng. are already\nwanting it for next year) and it has unqualified support from the Union. For the\ncourse to get off the ground a minimum amount of around \u00a32,000 is required( with a maximum of around \u00a3 1 0 , 0 0 0 ) . In terms of the number of students who could\nbenefit, and the educational value of the course, this seems a relatively small\nprice to pay (the College's electricity bill is \u00a3i+00,000p.a.). The only way that\nthe College can be persuaded to give any real support to its vague approval of\ndiversification is by generating interest among staff and students for courses\nof tik is type. This must come through departments.\nIf you want to have a chance of taking this course, if you are at all interested in the broader relevance of the narrow discipline that you are studying, then\nfind out more about the course from your department rep. or from the Union Office. Make sure that your voice is heard in your department and in the College. Let\nthem give substance to their support of the ' spirit of diversification'. FIND OUT ABOUT IT - THINK - ACT\nTHE ABOVE IS NOT | MANIFESTO\nThis is; C0L FLETCHER\nI feel that the best way that this union can work for its members is to give more\npower to the constituent college unions. Each constituent college union represents\none third of the membership of lC. The vicepresident s of IC (Presidents of the CCU's) are far more representative\nof students than most members of council, therefore it is stud pid to try take them off council when they can in fact be mandated to bring and represent before council the \u2022\nmajority wi ch of one this d of ICU's members.\nCan most members of council honestly say that they represent the members of union, club, committee or department that elected them?\nICU can work much better in this way as it can act as a better focal point for\nstudent opinion by mailing sure that IC council IS representative of all students,\nundergraduate and postgraduate, and not just to act as a loudspeaker for in effect ural, petty politicians, who like the sound of their own voices. Let's keep polities out of the union, and let the union floor tell it selected representatives what the students want.\n*-\u2022\u00bb\u00bb***#**\u00ab \u00bb*#*\u00ab\"****#'#*'# *********** ************\nBest wishes for a speedy\u2022. recovery go to Dave Sugden, editor of FELIX, who is 'at pre sent in the Health Centre.\n\n"

And\nthey have the cheek to ask the\nprincely sum of 30p for it. No,\nreally, I have never thrown up\nat the sight of anything before,\nbut this time I was really close\nto it. But I couldn't bring myself\nto defile its fine glossy pages.\nAnd, as you probably haven't gathered by now, this week's exploration of the cultural backwater of magazine publishing in\nBritain concerns itself with the\n'Glossies', with a view to finding\nout what, if anything, is worth its\nhigh price in this field.\nThe most famous glossies are,\nof course, Country Lite and the\nIllustrated London News. Starting with the former, which has\nthe amazing quality of actually\nselling something like 60,000\ncopies every week. It's another\nsocial affair, like the Tatler\n(which actually means purveyor\nof trivial twaddle, how right can\nthe Oxford dictionary be) but\nmore country orientated, as you\nmight gather from its title. The\nField is similar, and the Scottish\nField is the same with a Welsh\ninfluence. All twaddle, unless\nyou're the type they're really\naimed at, in which case you'll\nalready be an avid reader, i.e. if you don't read it now, it's not\nfor you.\nNow the Illustrated London\nNews is altogether another kettle of dignitaries. Recently altered from weekly to monthly,\nmainly because of a lack of\nreadership, the latter has sprung\nup as if from nowhere. This\nmight lead one to believe that it\nhas drastically altered. But no,\nit hasn't. It's the same old mixture as before, only dished up\nmonthly instead of weekly at an\nincreased price and diminished\npage size. Nevertheless, as ever,\nits picture coverage is good, and\nso are the few articles contained\nin it, and it's altogether a good\nmag to have lying around. Its\nU.S. competitor, Life, while less\nglossy, also has good picture\ncoverage. However, they've\nfound that they make more\nmoney by printing less copies,\nso you might find it difficult to\nfind a copy.\nMost of the glossies are orientated towards the ladies, but let\nnot that worry you gentlemen.\nYou'll find interesting reading in\nmany of these magazines, the\nmost highly thought of which is\nHarper's Bazaar and Queen.\nThis merger of two magazines\nhas, I'm glad to say, preserved\nmost of the former excellence\nof Queen feature-wise, and added the fashion-wise stuff of\nHarper's. The features are really\ngood, and this month included\narticles on psychiatry and the\nhead-shrink ers of Harley Street,\nDreams, paintings, et al.\nBut it's got competition from\nits own company, National Magazines, which this month have\nlaunched the British version of\nCosmopolitan. Priced at only\n20p, against Harper's35p, with\nthe same number of pages, it's bound to be a winner. Or so\nthe FELIX typist says. The features are interesting and 'pro-gres sive', sexually anyhow, as\nfar as women's magazines go. It\nhas an impressive list of\ncolumnists, drawn from all sections of the world of writing for\nwomen, and an adventurous set\nof features. Sandwiched between\nreviews, stories, and fashion\narticles are features on 'I was a sleep-around girl', 'How to turn\na man on' and The Other erogenous zones'. Like groovy,\nman.\nI'd better not leave the men\nout, though. And what better\nnamed magazine for them than\n'Men Only'. Almost without\ndoubt the glossiest of the g los sies, soon to be printed by\nphoto gravure, which, if you know\nwhat that means, will be even an\nimprovement on the already flawless reproduction of every portion of the female form. Nothing\nis left to the imagination. W.H. Smith and John Menzies won't handle it. What better recommendation could I give. 100\npages every month of the most\npathetic articles and features\nand most photogenic nudes that\ncan be obtained legally for 40p. They should really get life for\nsome of the rubbishy copy that\nthey print. And some day they\nprobably will, if Lord Longford\nhas his way.\nWell, have a glossy time. I hope that this series has stimulated your passions for magazine\nreading, and that you'll go on to\ndiscover for yourselves the rest\nof the umpteen thousands of\nperiodicals published in this\ndemented, pseudo-cultured world\nof ours. But you'll need to wait\nto see another of the finest publications known to man. I'm sorry that it's so far away, but\nthat's life. Oh, by the way, it's name is 'Felix'. So long.\nabout what is said. It's probably even more serious\nthan a war between Uncle Sam and the Ugly Bear with\nthe Dragon as the referee, and my dear lecturer, 'that's what it is all about, isn't it?'... \"And a little strawberry of blood was making haste to\nlive, with a sort of guileless urgency, a besotted little\nstrawberry, not even yet an animal, soon to be scraped\nout of existence by . . . \" Wow, doesn't that sound\ngood...

Gerrard\nIn choosing the president\nfor the coming year, I believe\none should not pick someone\nwith too fixed a point of view,\nand who will, therefore, bend to\nthe will of the Union (not as has\nhappened in the past). He must\nhave a large knowledge of the\nrelevant facts so that each member of the Union may make up\nhis own mind on a subject. In\norder for this to happen, he must\nhave a good understanding of\nhow to run a Union meeting, and\nthe relevant standing orders.\nFurther, he must have the I.C. students at heart before any\nsocial or political commitments.\nAlthough the above may seem\ndifficult to carry out, I hope to\nfulfil the role of president with\nthat basis. As R.C.S. President\nfor the past year, I have learnt\na lot about running a Union, and\nalso a great deal of information\nabout the various committees of\nI.C. Union.\nSeveral items I foresee as important in the coming year are:\n1) Information\u2014too few students understand fully what Academic affairs, Welfare etc.,\nreally do\u2014hence no one cares.\nI would encourage all committees to issue information, not\nlengthy, but containing information in such a form that a Fresher could understand it.\n2) Continue our struggle for\nbetter accommodation\u2014starting\non the long overdue new halls\nof residence; a university-fin an ced local lodgings bureau, etc.\n3) Co-ordination between\nI.C.U. and the C.C. U's. to provide not only an effective 'poli-t ical side\", but also a better\nsocial side.\nI hope that this will encourage everyone to take an interest\nin I.C.U. elections, and especially in\nYours truly,\nW.

He has had no\nreason to question the nature\nof direction of his education,\nand one who has been subjected to an academically biased\nand intellectually very narrow\ncourse of education since the\nage of fifteen. Yet within the\nconfines of the college and its\nalready narrow influence the individual is still further isolated\nfrom any diversity of stimuli, intellectual or otherwise.\nThe college fails to either recognise or accept its resp on sibi ties to its students as individuals. The college insists that\nplacing the burden on the individual is all part of the 'chal-leng e' of university life, vital in\na process of character building\nand essential in producing the\nsort of good moral fibre that industry demands. It assumes that\nsecondary education has been\nsuccessful in producing an annual supply of 800 well-balanced\nindividuals. That is the only sort\nof student that IC really caters\nfor. It must be shown otherwise.\nAny individual has the right to\nan education that caters for his\nneeds as a person, and not just\nthe needs of external industry\nand governmental interests.\nAnd so how does the Union\nfit into this iniquitous picture?\nHow can it play a valuable role\nwhen in the eyes of many a cynic it is regarded merely as\na playground for extreme political activists and a handful of\nothers who like the sound of\ntheir own voices (sic). The first\nstep is to remove that image\nand then by a process of restructuring and clearly defining\nits role, develop an entirely new\napproach to its relationship both\nto the college and to its mem-be rs. The Union should be seen\nto be primarily concerned with\nthe interests of its members (in\nevery sense of the word), with\ngoing some way towards offering that which the college does\nnot. It must take the initiative\nto work for a better community\nthan that which exists at pre s ent. Or in one sentence, the\ncreation of a real educational\nCOMMUNITY.\nAs late as last Sunday\nthere was no opposition to\nMike Griffiths as Deputy\nPresident. It is as well that\nsuch an important post\nwill be contested and not\ngo the way of many minor\nplaces in the Union. Too\noften, people get elected\nunopposed. This can benefit no-one, the students feel\nleft-out (even though it's their fault!) and the candidate is never forced to\nthink out his policies in\nany great detail.\nAdmittedly, the post of\nDeputy President lacks the\nglamour of the other two\nand all credit goes to Mike\nGriffiths for standing first.\nHowever, Paul Jowitt is\nplanning on standing as\nwell and so: \u2014\nMike Griffiths\nThe Deputy President has an\nuncertain position in I.C. Union.\nOfficially he is number 2 in the\nUnion; in fact the Hon. Secretary and President are the two\nsabbatical officers, so he tends\nto be number 3 for most practical purposes. Besides being in\nthis general position of responsibility he has certain specific\ncommitments: he is in charge of\nthe Union building and discipline\nin the bars. By tradition he is responsible for almost anything\ndomestic, such as the Union's dealings with the refectories.\nBy the end of this year I will\nhave been the academic affairs\nofficer of the RCS Union for\nnearly two years. It is not a glamorous post, so you may\nnever have heard of it or me.\nHowever it is not a trivial job,\nand in fact it puts me automatically on thirteen committees\nfrom the college Board of Studies to the RCSU General Committee. One of these committees\nis ICU Council, the body that\neffectively runs your Union. Over\nthe last two years I have taken\nplenty of opportunities, both on\nthese committees and outside\nthem, to see what goes on and\nparticipate in it.\nI think I have the experience\nand ability to do the job of Deputy President. At the time of\nwriting my nomination is not\ncontested. If it is, I hope you\nwill vote tor me\u2014// you're not\nconvinced, come to the hustings\ntoday to ask questions. Whether\nI'm opposed or not, if I get in I hope I can justify your vote.\nWill you give me the chance?\nPaul Jowitt\nDeputy President:\u2014 ...\nQ1. What does he do?\nQ2: What ought he to do?\nQ3: What did he do?\nQ4: What should he do?\n05; What will he do?\nA1: Debatable.\nA2: Debatable.\nA3: Questionable.\nA4: Arguable.\nA5: You tell me, that's the\ngeneral idea.\nYou see, the job has never\nbeen defined. The D.P. usually\nhas to deal with Union discipline, the refectory committee,\nthe bar committee, security and\nmaintenance of the Union Buildings, etc.\nI know enough about the job\nto know that I can do it, I know\nenough about it, to want to do\nit. I don't know too much about\nit to be straitjacketed completely by it and resistant to change.\nTo most people the Union\nmust improve its facilities, its\nideals and its involvement. It\nconstantly needs new ideas. Its\nfairly easy to just keep the\nUnion with its head above water,\nbut that would leave it as a stereotyped soft-boiled egg, devoid of any activity of new\nconcepts.\nAs far as I am concerned,\nthe Unions' own discipline procedures are totally inadequate\nand archaic. Compared to the\nUnion/College discipline procedures, they tend to resemble the\nSpanish Inquisition.\nLooking at other Universities/\nColleges of comparable size and\nUnion Fee incomes, the Union\nBuilding and its facilities are\nabysmal. I have some ideas in\nmind for the Lower Lounge; they\nneed some feedback to see if\nyou like them, and checking\nout to see if they are practical.\nThere are more loosely defined roles the D.P. can play.\\\nThere is mixed thought whether\nor not he should involve himself in the policy forming, policy\nimplementing of the Union. I believe he should be involved.\nTo cut himself off from NUS,\nCommunity Action, Academic\nAffairs, etc. is just like burying\nhis head in the sand. It's ironical\nthat the Union is always cajoling\npeople to get involved, and\nwhen they do, to shut them up\nand send them away to be a good boy.\nSo there it is, I don't know\nall the answers, but I am receptive to ideas. So between us, I think we can go places, I hope\nso.\nAnd now we come to\nwhat many people consider the most difficult job\nof all, that of Honorary\nSecretary. To date, only\ntwo people are seriously\nconsidering the post; Mairi\nWaddington and Martin C. Black (Secretary of RCS and Floor Rep).\nBoth have produced\ndocuments.\nM.C. Black\n/ am standing for the position\nof Hon. Secretary of Imperial\nCollege Union because I know\nthat I am capable of doing the\njob and doing it well.\nI am not going to publish long\nmanifestos full of promises be-cause, rather than having policies of his own, it is the duty\nof the Hon. Secretary to be the\nservant of the Union and he\nexists to carry out the wishes\nof the Union Meeting as well as\norganising the efficient administration of the Union.\nI see my role as an administrator of Union Affairs. Through\nmy experience of various College Committees and therefore\nmy knowledge of procedure and\nCollege Administrative staff, I see myself as a strong link between the Union and the College.\ni/ have some ideas for sorting\nout the bureaucratic tangle\nwhich exists in and almost engulfs I.C.U., but rather than\nbore readers of Felix, I hope\nthat anybody who is interested\nin these will come and chat to\nme.\nThus, MARTIN C. BLACK \"you\nknow it makes sense\".\nMairi Waddington\nWith all the present publicity\nabout women in the Union Bar\netc., may I first assure you that\nthis is not another women's lib.\nassault on the Union.\nYes\u2014women in the Union Bar\nbut the best suggestion I 've\nheard is a reciprocal arrangement of a take-over of the ICWA\nlounge for a new snooker table\nand/or pin ball machines!\nOver the past two years I 've\nbeen Social Year Rep, on RCS\nEnts committee, Assistant Secretary of ICU Academic Affairs and\nI 've sat on Council as Maths\nDepartment Rep., so I have considerable ex pei rence in Union\nAdministration.\nBasically I see the position of\nHon. Sec. as being an apolitical\none (politics are best left to\nPresidents) and as being concerned with the internal structure and running of the Union.\nAlthough communication has\nstarted to improve a little there\nis a tremendous amount still to\nbe done. How many people\ncame away from the last Union\nmeeting feeling helpless in the\nface of steam-roller ing by those\nwho knew the suitable procedural motions?\nImprovement should start at\nthe bottom with the year reps,\nbecoming much more involved.\nEach department should have a publicity officer (one of the year\nreps, perhaps?) to keep everyone informed about what's going\non.\nHowever hard work and a real\ninterest are needed and I am\nprepared to put that hard work\ninto the job if you will vote for\nme next Thursday. (After all,\nthink how safe your Union Finance would be with a Scot!)\nThis ought to be the\nclosest of all the elections\nsince both candidates\nhave much to recommend\nthem.\nAnyone who has been\nto a Union meeting cannot\nhave missed seeing Martin\nBlack. A women secretary\non the other hand will appeal to a lot of people,\nespecially one who wants\nto get things done.\nFelix intends to remain\ncompletely impartial in this\nwhole election. Owing to\nthe fact that nominations\ndid not have to be in till\nyesterday, it is possible\nthat some people have not\nhad anything printed in\nthis article.\nIn order to prevent any\nallegations of bias we\nhave decided to give\nspace in Felicity for anyone not included before\nand so I refer you to the\nlast ever Felicity!\nVAC JOB INDEX\nA directory listing thousands\nand thousands of temporary\nvacation Job opportunities\nthroughout UK and abroad.\nGET YOUR COPY NOW\nFROM YOUR STUDENTS'\nUNION OR YOUR LOCAL\nBOOK STALL,\nor write directly to R.

Unfortunately most of you will simply turn another page in\nyour text books and not bother to vote at all. To a certain extent one cannot blame you for this when one\nconsiders the very poor turnout of candidates there has\nbeen for the various posts. The number of candidates\nfor the posts recently offered of Departmental Representatives for the various departments was so pathetic\nthat Mr. Hobman resorted to the unconstitutional practice of accepting candidates who were not fully\nseconded without so much as a by-your-leave from the\nunion he serves. This is, of course, quite unforgivable.\nThe fact that no students stand as candidates or bother\nto vote, is not. Each student should endeavour to the\nlimit of his ability to ensure that each post is filled with\na person who will represent fairly and forcefully the\nviews of the people he represents. If you do not feel\nthat the candidate for any post fulfills this role then you\nshould not just forget that the election exists at all, but\noppose him yourself or if this is not possible at least\nregister your vote as an abstention, as this may bring\nabout a second election which would hopefully inspire\nnew interest.

Ignoring the Summer Issue\nwhich must be a headache for the Publications Board\nat the moment (as Editors of Felix are elected for only\nthe first two terms) I look forward with hope in my\nheart to passing on my post to a sabbatical officer of\nthe Union. Editing Felix, as I suspect few people realise,\nis made infinitely more difficult by the prevalent apathy\nat IC. Under the present system I feel that no matter\nhow hard an Editor may try he will never overcome this\n(God knows I 've tried). The only solution as I see it is\nto give the Editor a chance to devote his full-time attentions to making Felix a medium in Imperial College. If I have done nothing else I hope I will have succeeded\nin giving someone this chance as I believe Felix is well\nworth it.\nMay I now close by thanking everyone who has helped\nor contributed to the production of Felix over the past\nyear and I hope that they will do so again next year.\nFELIX, 9th March: Editor, Dave Sugden; Deputy Editors,\nHugh Hefner, Dolly Owson, John Stares; Assistant\nDeputy Editors, Ross McBeath, Dave Gribble, Chris\nPotter; Assistant Editors, Sid Amor, Bob Carter, John\nBryan; Cartoon Editors, Dave Gribble, Colin McCall;\nPicture Editors, Colin McCall, Dave Gribble; Foreign\nNews Editors, John Horsfall, Dug Saveden, Cob Barter;\nCookery Editorial Board, Bernard Williams, Martin Harp;\nCookery Editors, Colette Robinson, Mary Short; Contributor of C.J.

Mrs. Mary Whitehouse, Hon. General Secretary of the National\nViewers' and Listeners' Association (NVALA), attended a Touchstone gathering at Silwood Park last weekend. She addressed the\nmeeting on the dangers of declining moral standards emphasising\nthe immense effects of the broadcasting media, and was later\navailable for an exclusive FELIX interview on some of the wider\nissues on which she has expressed views.\nThe address that Mrs. White- rarely comes into it. Two years\nMrs. Mary Whitehouse\nat Touchstone\nhouse gave consisted mainly of\nan explanation of the work in\nwhich she is currently engaged\nand the fields in which she has\ncampaigned for the past eight\nyears. It was a great pity that\nthere was very little said with\nwhich any but the most extreme\ncould disagree \u2014 this being\nlargely due to Mrs. Whitehouse\navoiding most issue of controversial interest. She felt that a stand for censorship (\"no, I prefer the word control\") was\nessential on all areas of life for\na free society.\nReligion is undoubtedly the\nbasis of all Mrs. Whitehouse's arguments. Against a background of comments such as\n\"Man is more than man \u2014 man\nis a spiritual animal,\" s pir tu al and religious points were consistently used for justification.\nThe following morning two\nFELIX staff conducted this interview :\nFELIX: Do you feel that occasions such as this (Touchstone)\ngive you a feedback of peoples'\nopinions and do you modify your\nviews accordingly?\nMW: I think meetings such as\nthis are a good idea and I have\nbeen impressed by the serious\nattitudes of the people here.\nThree years ago when I first\nspoke at Cambridge Union I was\nregarded as an outsider, a Philistine, but now, with defences\ndown I think we are all surprised just how much we have\nin common.\nFELIX: Would you say your work\ncould be summarised into being\na fight again pornography?\nMW: Heavens no! Pornography\nago 24 Hours covered the shooting of a blue film in Denmark,\nnaturally we were concerned\nabout this. Basically my concern\nis with TV but I do feel the. media\nare in div is able. I am not on Lord\nLongford's committee, but i do\nwork closely with him. With regard to news broadcasts I do\nfeel that our first requirement\nshould be fair representation.\nFELIX: You quoted in your talk\nthe claim that \"Civilisation and\nunbounded sex are incompatible\". Have you any experience\nof this in modern society?\nMW: Evidence at present is difficult to find. If we look back\nthrough history, even modern\nhistory, we can see the use made\nof pornography by the Nazis and\nCommunists. Even in terms of\nsimple mathematics they are incompatible and I must say that\nthis is self-evident to me. Naturally affairs between a man and\nwife are nothing to do with me\nbut it is something to be aware\nof. I think that couples should\nnot give only unto themselves\nbut also to others.\nFELIX: Do you consider the work\nof Martin Cole and Richard Neville to be sincere?\nMW: These are two different\npeople. Dr. Martin Cole is interested in Dr Martin Cole full stop.\nPublicity to Martin Cole is almost sexual satisfaction. He has\nsaid public y,\"I do what I do to\npurge myself\".\nRichard Neville is politically\nmotivated. He is committed to\nhis political beliefs.\nFELIX: How great an extent do\nyou think broadcasting has influenced the standards of Modern Civilisation compared with\nother social pressures?\nMW: Why have drugs had such\npower? It is certainly not separable from Broadcasting although again I do feel that an\nincreasingly more responsible\nattitude is being taken by the\nBBC. Lord Hill has recently put\nout a directive saying, \"Drugs\nOut\".\nFELIX: Do you know why the\nITA is composed in such a different form to the BBC.\nMW: I suppose that the structure\nis to reflect regional feelings.\nTWW lost their licence because\nof bad policy in Wales. I don't agree with the ITA policy towards London (i.e. LWT).\nFELIX: You have spoken a lot\nabout a Broadcasting Council.\nCould you say something about\nits proposed constitution.\nMW: We hope to produce a paper on this later in the year.\nFELIX: What responsibility to you\nthink magazines such as Penthouse and Cosmopolitan should\nfeel?\nMW: You may know that I was\nused in a Cosmopolitan advertisement as an obvious non-reader. I am. I am disgusted by\nsuggestions portrayed in these\nmagazines, especially the wo-men's ones.\nFELIX: Could we ever return to\nStatus Quo?\nMW: I see three definite courses\nopen to us:\n1. Unbounded sex sowing its\nown seeds of disaster.\n2. Dictatorship.\n3. Making Democracy work.\nI would very much like to see\nthe latter.\nOn this note Mrs. Whitehouse\nended She will be returning for\nan Associated Studies lecture\nnext year. After the chance of\nseeing \"Growing Up\" I think she\nshould be worth seeing.\n\"\nTime up, Sir Gilbert\" Gilbert Longden's( he is\na Conservative back-bench\nMP) private member's bill\ncalling for a Student Union\nRegistrar ran out of time\nwhen it was being discussed in the House of\nCommons the Friday before last.\nIt was second on the\nOrder Paper that afternoon\nbut its debate didn't start\nuntil about 3.45. The Parliamentary rules state that\na vote can't be taken if a member still wishes to\nspeak at 4.00 p.m. Sure\nenough this happened \u2014 a Labour front ben cher so\nI'm told.\nThis means that on the\nfollowing Friday the bill\nwent to the bottom of the\norder paper, giving it almost no chance of reaching discussion and with\nfuture bills coming in for\ntheir second reading as a higher priority, Mr. Longden has had his day.\nThus another short term\nvictory and one from which\na few points can be gained.\nFirstly the Government\nfront bench took a noncommittal line, which\nmeans it couldn't have\nbeen so far away from their\nidea of a Registrar as all\nthat. Secondly, MP's can be very usefully lobbied \u2014\nthe NUS Exec, had briefed\nfive Labour MP's to speak\nfor 26 minutes each if necessary and the many telegrams sent to the Labour\nFront Bench (including\none from ICU) might have\nhelped them to make up\ntheir mind to speak at 4.00\np.m. Two interesting and alarming points that were\nslipped into Longden's idea of a Registrar were\nfirstly a clause with regard\nto registration saying that\nan application could be\nmade on behalf of a Students' Union, i.e. meaning\na Governing Body could\nregister a Union with a Constitution none of the\nUnion agreed with and secondly a clause saying all\nmonies must be spent to\ndirectly benefit the individual members \u2014 a warning light for such things as\nCommunity Action, Rag\nequipment, etc.\nAnyway\nday again.\nwe won the\nThe NUS has now called\nfor another day of action\non Monday, 1st May \u2014 so\nany god ideas for action\non that day to the Union\nOffice please, where we\nstill have plenty of 'HANDS\nOFF STUDENT UNIONS\nBADGES' left at 1p each \u2014\ntake them home at Easter,\nsell them to your friends.\nWOMEN IN UNION BAR\nLIB AND B(R) AR\nUnfortunately for the preservation is ts, Women's Lib seem to\nhave gained the upper hand in\nthe continuing fight for the\ndomination of the Union Bar.\nA short while ago, Betty Garbutt and Co., Dave Hobman\n(still smarting from his recent\nexpose in Felix) discovered that\nthere was no rule in the ICU\nConstitution banning women\nspecifically from the Union Bar.\nThis news was quickly conveyed\nto a clique led by an aggressive\nyou n gal named Betty who decided to exploit the situation.\nA newcomer to the IC political\nscene, Betty is believed to be\nengaged in 1st year Zoology\nand resides in Beit.\nBetty's plan was to invade the\nUnion Bar every day for a week\nwith a group of 'Women's Lib'\npeople. This plan was inaugurated last Thursday and Betty\nwith such strange, but not unexpected fellow or the cause as\nPiers Corbyn and Dave Hobman,\nalong with several women and a number of 'Heavies' presented\nthemselves at the Union Bar.\nThe IC lads, sensing trouble, lit\nthe fire in the Bar and retired\ngracefully. After a successful\nattempt to extinguish the fire by\nthe Heavies they were ignored\nand normal activities were resumed in the form of a drinking\nmatch between Pete Earl and\nHilary.\nThe next night, Friday, proved\nto be more interesting. The girls\nreturned again, this time in a random fashion, to the bar, but\nthis time met heavier opposition\nin the form of a Chap's Club\nDinner. Brendan, sensing trou-ble, gradually persuaded the\nwomen to leave in his normal\nsmooth way. Betty, however, not\naware of this, was doused with\na pint of beer for not moving,\nalthough she had not yet been\nsubjected to Brendan's smooth\naction, and has been so obsessed with the darts playing\nthat she couldn't have been expected to have noticed anyway.\nBetty continued playing darts\nunperturbed until the treatment\nwas repeated. Whereupon the\nfamiliar Union Bar chant was initiated and Betty was placed on\na table with a yard of beer and\ngiven the choice of getting it or\nthem down.\nBetty, not to be beaten, took\ntwo sips and poured the remainder over a certain Mr. Mark\nWoods (RSMU President), who\nwas standing close.\nFinally, at this point, our attention moves to one of Betty's male\nassociates, who claims that during the above festivities advances were made to Betty. He\nwas disgusted with the, and we\nquote, 'horny old perverts present in the Bar.' (Thinks, maybe\nthis is why we keep women out\nof the Bar).\nDave Amos, the duty officer in\nthe Uinon on Friday night was\nunfortunately unable to save\nBetty from the clutches of the\nUnion Bar since he was just\nabout to move into action as she\nwas evicted after the incident\nwith Mr. Woods.\nMarch 24th \u2014last\nday of term\n7.30p.m. for 8.0p.m. College Block\nEASTER BALL\nDINNER, BANDS,\nCABARET,DISCO\n5gn s.

Cup semi-final, with Goldsmiths fielding five U.L. U. players, but their thoughtful preparation which had\ntaken place off the field\nwas well rewarded.\nThe opening minutes of\nthe game were true to cup\ntie tradition with both\nteams trying to establish\ntheir superiority. Play was\nfast and possession was\nkeenly contested with the\nsides evenly matched.\nHowever, it was Goldsmiths who eventually took\nthe lead, when the ball\nwas hammered across the\nI.C. goal mouth. P. Worthington stopped it but as he\nstretched to clear he sliced the ball into his own\nnet. This seemed to kindle\nthe extra determination\nwhich was required from\nthe I.C. team and from\nthis point onward they\ndidn't look back. Their determination began to bring\nthe just rewards as they\nbegan to press u rise the\nGoldsmiths defence and\nafter three very near misses in scrambles around\nthe Goldsmith's goal-mouth Ian Rodgers eventually put the ball into the\nnet to make the half time\nscore 1\u20141.\nIn the second half I.C. began to play with much\nmore confidence, the ball\nwas played swiftly and players were beginning to\nfind space up front whilst\nat the back P. Worthington, S. Wells, M. Pearson\nand P. Maslin seemed to\nhave the Goldsmiths attack\nwell under control. The\nsheer determination of B. Smith, B. Milne and I. Rodgers up front was rewarded when B. Milne put\nI.C. ahead and soon afterwards the same player\nmade the score 3\u20141. However, Goldsmiths had by\nno means conceded defeat\nand but for some very\ncourageous goal keeping from M. Whitham they\nmight have pulled a goal\nback. P. Bartlett substituted J. Kelly in midfield and\nthis seemed to steady the\nI.C. team, who had lost C. Willcock, their captain, after an incident in the Goldsmiths penalty area. However, to clinch what must\nbe regarded as a great vic-tory, I.C. scored twice\nmore before the final\nwhistle. N. Fryer made no\nmistake from the penalty\nspot and B. Smith steered\na great through ball, which\nhad caught the Goldsmiths\ndefence flat-footed, past\nthe groping goalkeeper.\nThis victory now puts\nI.C. into the final at Motspur Park on March 11th when they meet Q.E. C. On the same date the\nI.C.2 nd XI meet Goldsmiths II and will be keen\nto retain the Reserve Cup\nand complete the double\nof cup and league once\nagain.\nHYDE PARK RELAY\nSaturday, 19th February saw a multitude of runners from various parts of\nthe globe converge on the\nUnion building. The reason was the cross country\nclubs big event of the\nyear: the Annual Invitation Hyde Park Road Relay.\nEntries this year were\nwell over the 90 team mark\nand with six runners in\neach team (each running\none lap of the 2 mile 1740\nyard course) that meant\nthere were over six hundred people present, when\nthe markers, officials, helpers and supporters had\nbeen included.\nWith 10 minutes to go\nto the start, at 3.00 p.m., the 80 runners for the first\nleg were ready waiting at\nthe start, pushing and\nshoving to get a good pos i tion. With 4 minutes to go,\nthe race was started as\nthe pushing at the start\nwas getting violent.\nOn the command of get\nset go 80 athletes shot off\ndown Rotten Row at break\nneck pace; the organisers\nbore no responsibility for\npram s, horses, dogs, old\nladies etc. in the way.\nWith a mile gone Birmingham University took\nthe lead which they were\nJP\nnever to lose, through\nAndy Holden. He finished\nthis lap in a remarkable\ntime of 13 mins. 53 sees.\nAt the change-over Birmingham had a lead of 6\nseconds over P. Varney of\nYork University. I.C.'s first\nleg runner Rob Parker\ncame in 31st with a time\nof 14.56, the best time in\nthe race by an I.C. run-ner.\nThroughout the race Birmingham built up their\nlead and finished in a record time of 84 mins. 19\nsees., 1 min. 20 sees,\nahead of the second team\nand breaking the record\nthat they set up last year\nby 35 seconds. Leeds\nUniversity finished second\nwith a time of 85.39 and\nSheffield University finished third with 86.17. I.C. finished first among the\nLondon Colleges, one\nplace ahead of University\nCollege, but 34th in the\nwhole field with a time of\n94.22.\nDespite Birmingham's record breaking run they\ndid not run the fastest lap.\nThis went to John King\nfrom Alsager Training College with a time of 13\nmins. 39 sees. However, 4\nof their runners came within the fastest 10 laps and\ntheir slowest runner did a time of 14.19.\nAfter the race, a tea of\nsandwiches and cakes was\nravenously consumed by\nall while awaiting the\nresults. At 5.30, dead on\ntime, they were ready and\nMrs. H. Jones, the Pro-Rector's wife presented the\ncups and medals. Medals\nwent to the 1st3 teams and\nto the runner of the fastest\nlap. The Lady Roderic Hill\nCup went, for the second\nyear running to Birmingham University although it\nwas not actually presented to them, as they had\nthe cheek to leave it at\nhome (perhaps in antic ipa tion). The Imperial College\nUnion Cup went, for the\nnth year running to Borough Road College, the\nfirst team in with under 500\nmen in their college. They\ncame 4th in the overall\nfield.\nI would like to express\nmy thanks to Mrs. H. Jones\nfor presenting the prizes,\nthe officials who kindly\ngave up their time to help\nand to numerous members\nof the Cross Country Club\nand Imperial College,\nwhose help was greatly appreciated and without\nwhich the whole thing\nwould not have been pos-sib le. Cricket\nThe season that you\nhave all been waiting for\nis almost upon us, and I trust that you are going to\nplay for the College at c ric ket. The College runs at\nleast 3 teams and so caters\nfor all types of ability\n(even yours!). We are\nholding trials on the first\nWednesday of next term\n(26th April), and if you\nwish to come, sign on the\nCricket notice board in\nthe Union. I hope to see\nyou during the season.\nRugby\nOn Wednesday, 23rd February, I. C.1st XV played King's College in the\nsemi-final of the Gutteridge Cup and emerged victorious by 20 points to 4.\nI.C. won the toss and elected to play into a stiff (?)\nbreeze in the first half. The\nreferee was of \"I know\nyou Powell\" fame and\nwas soon awarding numerous penalties to I.C. as\nKing's did not know about\nhis eccentricities. This enabled I.C. to take the lead\nfrom a James penalty.\nKing's however came back\ninto the game when from\na loose ruc k near the I.C. posts, the ball was sent\nout to the winger who\nscored in the corner \u2014\nthe conversion failed. This\nscore seemed to spur on\nI.C. to greater heights and\nthe King's full back was\ncaught in possession under his own posts. He\nfailed to release the ball\nand so James kicked an\neasy penalty to put I.C. back in the lead 6\u20144. I.C. managed to hold out and\nturned round confident\nwith the wind now behind\nthem. King's task was\nmade more difficult as\nthey had lost a centre in\nthe first half with a finger\ninjury.\nA long kick-off pushed\nKing's back into their own\n25 and here they were to\nremain, except for brief\nbreakaway attacks, for the\ngame. Whenever they\nmanaged to get into the\nI.C. half they were driven\nback with long wind-assis-ted kicks by the I.C. de-fence. Being pinned in\ntheir own 25 it is understandable that all the penalties awarded to I.C. were\nfrom kick able positions.\nHowever, true to form,\nTebbett only got one but\nmade amends by getting a dropped goal as well. 12\u2014\n3 up, I.C. now began to\nthrow the ball about.\nKings' supporters began to\npoint out that I.C. had not\nyet scored a try and so to\nprove how \"easy\" it was to\nscore we let Roy Matthews\ntrundle over. This try came\nEDITORIAL\nFor those not in the Union bar on Wednesday,\nFebruary 23rd, the Rugby 1st XV won their semi-final\nagainst Kings 20\u20144 and the Football 1st XI hammered\nGoldsmiths 5\u20141 also to reach the final.\nThis is a great chance for I.C. to go down to Motspur\nPark and support these two teams on their respective\nSaturdays. The Rugby played L SE,a side they had\npreviously beaten, last Saturday, 4th March so the\nresult should be known \u2014 see Felicity. The teams were\nrumoured to be training hard before the match at their\nseaside hideaway near Balham, but they should be in\na relaxed state of mind after visiting the movies on\nthe Friday evening.\nIf you missed last Saturday, then you have another\nchance this week, Saturday 11th March when both the\n1st XI and 2nd XI play at Motspur against Q.E. C. and\nGoldsmiths 2nd's. The 2nd's play in the morning and\nmust be favourites but the 1st's have lost and won\ngames with Q.E. C.Q. E.C. are a small College but I expect them to be supporting their team in force so we\ncan show up our neighbours by filling the FREE\ncoaches which will be leaving the Union.\nThe Football Club, living on a shoestring budget,\nhave been unable to go pre-match training to Lilleshall\nbut are nevertheless confident.\nNext term, I.C. has a few unimportant academic tests\nbut there are excellent facilities for cricket and tennis\nto be used. The new captain of tennis is Pete Dunning,\nFalmouth 141 and he would welcome anyone interested\nin playing, to contact him.\nill mi \u00ab Hh fi HI H MP Hi lit\n\u2022ll W ll \u2022 : f \u00a7f \u00a7jj\nA scene from the Gutteridge Cup Final which I.C. won\n(see FELICITY).\nfrom aru ck won by Ken\n(get the beer in) Horseman who fed Bill Baines\nin the centre. Baines gave\nJim Hunt room in which\nto move and he in turn\ndrew the full back before\nfeeding inside to Roy Matthews who flopped over.\nKings' were now de moral is ed and I.C. scored another try through Jim Hunt.\nNeither of these tries were\nconverted, needless to\nsay. I.C. might have had\nanother try but the I.C. linesman Kitty Marriott decided to be honest and\ntell the ref that the ball\nhad gone into touch \u2014\nand so the score stood at\n20 points to 4 until the\nfinal whistle.\nMany thanks to our\nnumerous supporters \u2014\nyour vocal help was much\nappreciated.\nTeam \u2014 J. Hughes, J. McDonough, P. Pilkington,\nB. Baines, J. Hunt, A. James (capt), C. Flanagan, M. Sugrue, H. Michael, K. Horseman, R. Matthews, C. Humphries, T. Morris, I. Partridge, A. Tebbett.\nBoat Club regain Dixon Bowl\nImperial College 1st VIM\nwon the open division of\nthe University of London\nHead of the River to regain the Dixon Bowl. The\nrace held on the Tideway\nover the 'reversed boat\nrace' course was a gruelling affair, due to a gusty\nwind and an ebbing tide.\nThe water was very choppy\ndown to Hammersmith,\nand the wash from a tug\ncoming upstream caused\nconsternation to a few\ncox es. The start was staggered\nwith I.C. going off second,\nthey passed Guys Hospital\nand on the final timing\nwon by a comfortable margin of \\ minute, over St.\nThomas Hospital. Tyrian\n(U.L II) had the fastest\ntime but were not eligible\nfor the open division. I.C. II in spite of some jostling\nby their cox, had a disappointing row, and dropped\na couple of positions.\nIn the Senior C( Junior)\ndivision I.C. Ill were beaten into second place by\nU.C.&H. who came up\nfrom the back of the field\nto finish in 5th position\noverall and win the Senior\nC medal.\nThe most encouraging\nresults of the afternoon\nwere in the Novice division\nin which the 5th and 6th VIM's came 1st and 2nd respectively with just 5\nseconds between them.\nThe crews put up a really\ngood show and completely outclassed the rest of\nthe Novice entry. These\ncrews which will form the\nbasis of the club in future seasons have shown\nkeenness and rivalry, the\nresult of the dedication of\ntheir respective coaches.\n\n"
