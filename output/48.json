Second- ry \"to y cur elation \" t sudden we\" 1th you my when\ncollecting- your cheque at the Registry e ch tern, rive a thr jug ht to the people on the other side .of the counter.\nThey are part of the administration, the people occupying\nthe eastern part of the Beit building who direct the\nsmooth running of the college. Since he's one of our\nadministrators who more closely effects you, Mr. O.K. McDowall, the occupant of one of the small offices in this block, is today's subject for Profile. He is the\nman who does the back room v/or k of finding speakers for\nyour edification in General Studies Lectures.\nLike most of us, Mr. -LcDowall has been connected\nwith education most of his life; the difference is he\nlikes it. His father was a schoolmaster at Eton, where\nhe was a classical specialist, which means that he could\ntranslate the school motto (slip.de of a notorious I.C. president). From then to Balliol where he led the\nnori a al undergrad's life, which means that all the in ci dents you'd be interested in are unprintable.\nAf*ter attaining the rare distinction of a4t hol as e in Modern Greats he spent three years with Lever\nBros, soo.p boiling and clerking in Market Research.\nThis period contained his grete st concentration on\n\"embarrassing moments.\" \"Have you had your free packet\nof Stork margarine, Madam? Do you use it as a substitute\nfor butter in cokes?\" As commercial traveller he convincingly displayed the superiority of Per sil; he can\ntell you why it washes whiter.' During this time he had a 'harem' of \u20acC girls in Birmingham - not polygamy though,\nmerely a Per sil education ca.'-ra air n.avis it to Germany a is illusion ed him about National\nSocialism, after which he was for a period acting unofficial unpaid sub-editor of 'The Times'. Six years as a teacher of Modern languages in two different schools\nbrought him to the War and the conclusion that a school-master's life is too narrow. In the best undistinguished\nfashion he slowly rose to rank of Major at which he was\nde mobbed to spend three interesting years in helping to\n:\nreorganise German education being in charge of the\nTeachers' Training Colleges of a Region. Serving as\nchairman on a committee of German Education Officers he\ntook great delight in curbing the loquacity of each\nspeaker to a five minutes allowance, loudly ringing abell when time was up. This job was essentially transient and\nback in England he was almost 'on the dole', but by now he\nwas used to relying on himself, s. nd spells as L.C.C. clerk\nreporter of The Times Educational Supplement and teacher\nof English to foreigners only served to fill a view already\nof considerable breadth. This brings us to his appointment as Administrative Secretary at I.C. three years ago;\nwhile recently he has donned a gratifying mantle with an\nodious title: he is now Touchstone Secretary.\nMr. McDowell hae the easy un self conscious assurance\nwhich is the essential product of our public school\nsystem. His wife, who teaches French to Society bea.u ties, says that he always goes \"where angels fear to tread\".\nThis doesn't mean that he's one of the fools who rush, but\ngives a. picture of his natur u: a little impetuous a. nd overconfident but quick to learn by his own mistakes. His aim with General Studies Lectures is that they should be\nalways interesting - he himself is always interested.\nAnd then as part of his interest is Social Welfare.\nTaking part in the Allotments for the Unemployed scheme in South Wales during the depression he corrected hie\nerroneous impression of the characters of the re calc it rent\" in ers, and at Oxford he organised a party of under grade to help in relief work for the Rhine floods.

He thinks it will be a pity if1.0. develops into a University for Technology alone,\nbelieving n. lso that if I.C. became completely residential\nit would be the best thing that could hr wp on.; ir.

    "content": "FELIX\nth C'r* rj LM of the FORTNIGHT! LE PLA IS IR Studio One, Oxford Street\n\"More daring than La Ronde\" the advertisements in the tubes say. Hm . . . Well, perhaps. If you find the interior of amid Victorian French brothel daring\nit certainly would be. But if you look forward to this film as an aphrodisiac you may be disappointed.\nThe film is based on three stories by de Maupassant,\n\"Le Masque\", about a dance tragedy, \"Le Maison Tel lier\" about the visit of Mme. Tell i er's \"young ladies\" to one\nof her country relatives, and \"La Modele\" about the tribulations of a young artist's love for his model. I should like to say nothing at all about the first, it was almost ruined for me by reading a critique before 1\nsaw it; it is really far more subtle than most of the\ncritics realized, and should preferably be seen with an\nopen mind. Also don't be surprised if the emotional\nimpact doesn't arrive until some time later. The\n\"Maison Tel lier\" episode has been highly praised, but\nfrankly it is both inept and tactless, something of\nwhich one would hardly have thought Max Ophuls, the director, capable. I fear that he has turned de Maupassant's delicate, sensitive, atmospheric little story into a slickly suggestive tale about the sex lives of the rou es of a kind of Clochmerle-sur-Mer (and how dull it was - Oh for some really sinful doings on the films!)\nIt may be box office, but I'm sick of films which, in the worst American tradition, promise to be pornographic\nand then fail to deliver the goods. The last story I found far the best; anybody who has been in love long\nenough to know the queer growth of a deep intimacy, of a kind of compassion, which is still there in the midst of the worst rows, will recognize the real thing and will be glad because it too is all too rarely seen in the\ncinema. See the film for this alone, although the first episode too is worth notice. In all, the film is not as good as \"La Ronde\". Perhaps it is Max Ophuls' attitude to sex which is the\ntrouble. He is fascinated by it, of course, but at the\nsame time if you look closely you' ll see that it also frightens, even horrifies him. The only people in this film who don't,in some way, suffer for their sexuality are the prostitutes. This is almost pathological, and\nit nipples. i Please, please go and see this film i despite the\nna if hour queue) but don't think you're going to remember it along with \"Les Enfants Terrible s\" or \"Miraclo di Milano\". It's not really in that class. Shewing with this film is a new U.P. A. cartoon\n\"Sloppy Talopy\" featuring the shortsighted Mr. Magoo.\nAlthough it is not as good as \"Rooty-toot-toot\", which\nis fast coming to be recognized as a classic, and was\nproduced by the same company, this cartoon is so beautifully drawn and is podu ced in such an adult manner that\nI should run out of words of praise if I tried to describe it. H. W.G. LATE NEWS COUNCIL MEETS. Wednesday, 18th. March.\nStatement Issued to FELIX after the Union Council meeting\nheld last night.\nUNION EXPANSION\nHistory; Plans for two extra stories on present building\nwere drawn up in1927 as desirable accommodation for the\nstudent population of that date.

It is not a habit peculiar to those of a particularly Social turn of mind, nor to the especially observant. It is in fact common to all those who, for various reasons have nothing to read\nor smoke, and don't feel inclined to sleep. Which\nusually fits me.\nThat is the paragraph which in essay plans is cal led Introduction, and is just a verbose way of introducing the fact that I too watch people. Not very much\nwatching is necessary to enable one to classify passengers into Types, and to gauge their incomes within \u00b1 \u00a3100;\nthe whole thing really becomes a bore unless one starts applying, some imagination. It is quite easy to guess\nwhether one's victim is married, or what is contained in a tool bag or briefcase or suitcase; moderately easy\nto guess what aC.&A. carrier conceals; but what of brown paper parcels? Observe how that second paragraph brings me round\nto the main subject of my thesis. Brown paper parcels know no barriers at all; neither of country or creed\nnor class. A remarkable property is their in distinguish ability; thus if they were all jumbled up on the floor of the carriage it would not be possible to estimate\ntheir quality and price and decide on their owners on a class basis as it would be with shoes or hats. Their other remarkable property is the mes m eric effect they\nhave on their owners. A brown paper parcel is placed\nreverently between the feet, or rests in the lap with\nits owner's hands gently, yet slightly arrogantly clasped over it. It is not put behind the legs, as is a briefcase, or left by the door, as is a larger case,\nnor is it slung onto the luggage rack, like any old umbrella.\nWhat do they contain, these mysterious packages?\nThis workman's is neat, but clumsily tied has he\nstolen some tools from the workshop to try and make ends\nmeet at home, where his wife, a neurotic creature lashes\nout money on frozen vegetables and quarter-pounds of real ham, impervious to mentions of economy in the house-j hold? The soft, kind, wearily resigned look about his eyes suggests he is a dreamer, which is confirmed by the\nhalf grime-hidden yet undefeated sensitiveness of his fingers as they worry that knot . . . . that knot; that\nknot symbolic al of the bond between htm and his wife. It is a bond which he is loath to cut. He knows that\na cut is his only way to escape; and he knows that he\nhas not the .hardness in him to cut it. And the children? How could he leave them with Her, knowing as be\ndoes that they live only for ten to six to come round\nand bring Dad home. No, this is the only way out. He\nstarted two months ago, when he got some taps out, and\nsold them to an ever so slightly shady plumber friend, and tn is is the seconal ot. He kj tiu w st nat Jim down t ne road is in the trade and would give him half price and\nno questions asked; but where is it all going to end?\nBaker Street, that' s where I get out, and my dream\nhas to stop. But you see ho Vit works, and even if you\nhaven't been terribly interested in my pet hobby or my\ntiny story, you won't be able to help thinking about it when you next see someone on the train with a brown paper\nparcel. You' ll think up a little story, probably\npoignant and you' ll wonder if perhaps it is their first set of poems, even now being carried preciously to a publisher who will probably reject them; but there I go again. I know though that you will imagine, and\nthat' s just what I want you to do. This paragraph by\nthe way is what they usually call Conclusion, which means\nThe End..\nB.R.E.

'lather it seems that the\ngeneral result will be to produce a person who in addition\nto having been well-st c cke d with technique has imbibed a certain amount of a social atmosphere in a society which,\nby virtue of its closed nature, will smack somewhat of a ghetto. In fact it does not a ppe'r that the improvements\nyou demand, and which I assure you I am far from decrying,\nwill greatly improve the qualities of personality in our\nfuture technologists. To those who have these qualities it will be a boon perhaps, to those who have not it will be a social amenity; the 'sausage' I fear we shall always\nhave with us. The best hope is that by improving the\nenvironment the far r rer man of personality will be\nfostered thereby.\nYours sincerely,;,. M. H.L 'DSLR\nDear Sir, While agreeing with the bulk of your editorial in the\nlast issue of FELIX, I feel that your idea of a large hostel\nin a single unit calls for some comment. Surely one of\nthe things wrong with I.C. nov; is its size. To exist as a real university with the \"well-bred club atmosphere\" requires a College size of not more than about 500 students\n(The size of most 'Oxbridge' Colleges).\nNothing will be gained by building a gigantic hostel\nto house 1200 or 1500 students - the only atmosphere will be that of a dormitory. I believe the answer is to plan\nfor a number of hostels, in this district if possible\nsufficient in all to give each student at least one year's residence, but one small enough to exist as a compact unit\nin itself. Each should have its own lounges, refectory,\netc., and should cater for students reading as wide a range of subjects as possible.\nThis is' a long-term plan, but if we are determined to create a real Technological University, some such arrangement iB the only one possible.\nYours etc.\nR.

DEBATES Dear Sir, Your two recent correspondents overlook entirely the cunning design of the English, system of spelling. It ensures that the Englishman takes a sufficient time learning his own language to prevent him learning any other. Moreover, as the only person capable of comprehending the js n glis h system of weights and measures, he is indispensable to the technological world. It is incumbent upon all foreigner^, therefore, to learn English. The Englishman may thus enjoy the tolerant indolence befitting a superior being as those less favoured inhabitants of his Earth strive to achieve the culture which has been his from childhood. Yours faithfully, Alan Duffield. Owing to a surfeit of dances, the annual debate with\nBedford on Friday vies rather smaller than usual, but those\npresent enjoyed a debate of unusually high standard.\nFor Imperial College \"Jr. Spriggs proposed \"That Music\nbe the Food of Love\" in a quick firing, well illustrated speech. He Was ably countered by Kiss Ruth Meadows of Bedford, who analyzed the proposer's Freudian tendencies\nand her own in unequivocal terns.'\nMr. Pocock and Miss Wendy Dwyer seconded for their respective Colleges, with speeches which although good\nboth - suffered a little from nerves.\nThe floor speeches, which followed, were witty and\ncogent and led to an uproarious informal de rate. Phillip Allsop led the opposition atta.ck with an attempt at \"impartial\" analysis, while Mike Rich convulsed everyone with an\ninnocent story of the Ladies of Spain.\nThe Motion wo.s defeated by 14 votes to4 with 4 abs tensions, but the donate conti mie d furiously over coffee and\nsandwiches in the Lower Dining Hall. A New Departure in General Studies,\nOne oT The most persistent or it is cms of the General Studies\nLeoturea has been of the passive part taken by those attending.\nPossibly as a result, a debate was held in the Union on Marcfe\n5th on the motion \"This House considers social welfare may\nreduce individual responsibility\". Proposing, Mi1\n. Alan Peacock, M.A., of L.S.E., Btated that\nit was not social welfare itself that he was attacking, but\nthe method by which it is being carried out. Individual responsibility means having the will and the opportunity te conduct one's own affairs and to take important decisions.\nThe increase in3 tate organisation is related to the decline\nin local governmental control and efficiency. Opposing, Mr. Michael Stewart.M.P. and one-time President\nof the Oxford Union, agreed that loo al government badly\nneeded overhauling, but declared'- with what seemed to the\nwriter rather doubtful logic that as a crowd is leas responsible than the individual,,\u2022so the state can be more\nvirtuous than the o it i zen.It was to be expected that in a civilised community those with advantages in health or wealth\nshould help those at a disadvantage. People only appear to\nbe less responsible than their predecessors because of\nimproved standards of beha.viour. Seconding for the proposition, Mr. N. F.E. Blackmore,\nPresident of the Lit. and Deb. Soc, considered social welfare in its present form was\"the thin end of the wedge\"\nand that causes and remedies have become so obscured that\nindividual responsibility haB had to be replaced by nationalism - which can be strongly objected to on ethical grounds.\nMr. S. Ruhemann, President of the Political Society,\nseconding for the opposition, said that much of todays social\nwelfare was really state charity; only when it is the result\nof collective individual action - the contradiction is only\napparent - is it permissible. He concluded the principal\nspeeches by asking if the actions of unemployed or uneducated\npeople could be considered responsible.\nThere were only 10 minutes left for speeches from the\nfloor, the two best points being that the welfare state seta\na maximum on human endeavour and that the individual today\nis not freed from responsibility, but feels separated from it. The voting was close; 100 for,92 against and 21\nabstentions, and it would have been better to have cut the\nspeeches from the platform, none of which showed outstanding\ndebating style, to give speakers from the floor more time\nto discuss ideas as they came up. Such a procedure,\nalthough not in the best debating tradition, would have\nbeen closer to the aim stated by the Chairman; but perhaps\nthe organisers of Special Studies do not consider undergraduates capable of intelligent discussion.\non the authority of the B.B.C.

The Duke of Edinburgh\ndid not disturb the work of most of the College. His gleaming\nblack Austin princess NGN 1 arrived a few minutes late at\nthe Union Entrance, where the Rector and Viscount Falmouth,\nChairman of the Governors,were waiting to greet him. Lord\nFalmouth moved forward to open the door, but almost as soon\nas the car stopped it was thrown open by the Duke, who\nstopped briskly out. After posing for our photographers,\nthe party moved to the Rector's Room in the Union, where\nProf. Read and the three Deans met the Duke.\nThe first visit was to Chem. Eng. where exhibits of\nflame propagation in gases, explosion pressures, high pressure research and work on the extension of the Callendar\nSteam Tables (a product of the College) were on show. The\nparty than drove in three oars to the Mines, where our sor-respondent reported: \"Despite the efforts of a miner who\narrived after motoring all the way from Cham. Tech. Assistant Prof. Sheppard met him at the door. Asst. Prof.\nPryor was unfortunately ill after arranging some excellent\nwork. The Bessemer Lab., recently painted and rebuilt was\nspi ek and span without much special \"bull\" needing to be\ndone j to remind the Duke that the service atmosphere pervades\neven academic establishments. The Duke, after confessing\nignorance, was able after his tour to ask some very pertinent\nquestions. He was easy to talk to, and eager to find things\nout, except in the assay lab. where he is understood to 1-ive\nsummed the scene up in one terse phrase, and hurriedly turned\naway. At the expiry of the allotted half hour, tha Duke was\npolitely but firmly urged away, regardless of what he may\nhave really wanted to do. Perhaps there are advantages in\nbeing an impecunious student.\"\nI CW A DINNER. As reported in the Evening Standard, the annual\ndinner of the Imperial College Women's Association was held\non Friday, 6th March, and as on past occasions was notable\nfor several amusing speeches. In proposing the toast to\nthe Association Mr. de Reuck stressed the importance of\nminorities, especially such minorities as I. C.W. A. Replying to this toast the President, Mies Turnbull, apologised\nfor her lack of linguistic capacity and hoped the gentlemen\nwould excuse her if she spoke in English rather than in\nFrench. In her welcome to our distinguished guest, Mrs.\nHelena Normanton Q.C., Miss Entwistle made it clear that\nthe College is vitally interested in the bar, she also\ncleverly contrived to persuade the men of I.C. that we think\nthey are wonderful, as of course we do. These speeches were\na fitting introduction to that of our distinguished guest,\nwhose flow of witty remarks and sound common sense will not\nao on be forgotten.\nAfter the dinner the company moved to the gym', for\ndancing, to find there a gift \"to the Association*. We 3hould like to record here our appreciation of this ead rr as guest who\nwas ao be aut if fully displayed then and on the following\nnight. Among the spring-like decorations and with such distinguished companions we feel that Percy must have enjoyed\nhis change of air and have forgotten for a while his body-less state. \u201e A huge gem na ao 'ot stolen from Bart's. After lunch in Queenie's, the party went to the Guilds,\n\u2022where, in the Civil Engineering Department work connected\nwith the design of a new dam was on show. Later, in the\nlech. Eng. Dept. a gas turbine de ve1 op ment project was viewed.\nIt was here that the small failure occurred, about which the\nDuke ej q^ res sed concern in his letter via General Browning,\nhis aide, to the Rector after the visit. On the way through\nthe Goldsmith Lab., His Royal Highness suddenly stopped in\nhis track, turned, and went over to a heap of rubbish which \u2022\nwas lying on the floor. Several students were working on it. He spoke to them, asked about it, and described it as a \"won-de rful contraption\". This was Bo's Finest Hour.\nThen, over to the R.C.S. where an exhibition was\nstaged showing the history of the dyestuff s industry,\nfounded by William Perkin, discover or of mauve in our\nlaboratories, 1856, and ]ater developed in Germany following\nthe death of the Prince Consort, who alway a had an eye on\nBritish science. Research on chlorophyll-type colouring\nmatter was also shown\u00ab \u00bb;\nOur impression, gathered from several people who\ncame in contact with the Duke, was that he was keenly interested in what he was shown. He is known to be alive to tha\nscientific world's problems, and to be sympathetic. The\nother week he spoke about the need to make Science \"a little more fashionable\". He could not have been referring to our\nbeing out of date. Perhaps ha meant that it is remote from\nnational life; that it is tucked away in dark corner*.\nMaybe his visit, unofficial and so. little publicised as it was (Lord knows why!) will help to do something about it.

Circulation: 1200.\nSpringtime in Kncland, and lovers are straying\nCer trie glad green and along the bright Janes,\nSj-.r kling with laughter and carelessly playing,\nYouth in its glory, young blood in its veins.\nSing of the Springtime, the time of the morning;\nDays when the dawn in f: of living, seems bright.\nSing of the Springtime; too soon comes the yawning,\nYearning, for peace in the blankness of night.\nSing of the Springtime; co:<te join the mad caper.\nSing until time calls a halting for breath-Softly they ll sing then, entombed where a taper\nCasts a cold gleam on the dull mask of Death.\nThe storms continue, but the Editorial column\nemerges for an Easter respite, scarred with traces of\nthe old wars. Though the Spelling Controversy, the\nCarnival Controversy, the General Studies Controversy,\nthe University Controversy, the Hostel Controversy,\nall have had their place in this column, we leave them\nalone and let peace and the joys of meditation fall from our weary pen on to our faithful readers.\nWhile those who have developed the habit of\nturning straight to the Editorial to find the latest\nhowl will be disappointed, there must be others who\nwill sigh with relief now that FELIX, after so\nturbulent term, has curled up in front of the fire to dream of the vacation, while Viewpoint and Letters\ncontinue the conflicts. We have heard it said lately that FELIX is much more serious than he used to be, and far less\nfunny. We can only lament our lack of humour, and\npray for gifted writers, but on the other point we\nmake no apology at all. As a responsible servant of\nthe College, FELIX must act in an adult way concerning\nstudent life and any matters which may influence x ne conditions in our College. In particular coverage of\nthe new expansion programme deserves as much space as\nwe can supply, and far more facts than are made known to\nus. It is our business to act in accordance with the\nstudents' interests.\nBut we are wandering from the Springtime philosophy\nof the poem which herds this Editorial, and which has not\nyet justified its appearance in this column. It was\nwritten as a reminder that there are more things in this world, Kr. Syllabus Setter, than are dreamt of in your\nphilosophy, and that the v cation which is even now\nsurging towards U3 is one of the times for finding this out.\nFinally, to degenerate from a lofty Editorial \"we\"\nto a very personal \" I\",I wish in the last paragraph of\nmy final Editorial to thank all the members of the FELIX\nstaff for their fine v/or k during my term of office. While I should not in\" a i mess mention ^any names without\nmentioning them all, I feel that the work of the\nProduction Department is particularly worthy of the\nhighest praise. We have several people who never achieve\n(cr even aspire to) the glamour of print, but. who work\nconsistently a. nd quite admirably to ensure that FP'LIX\nappears. Thanks also to several other retiring members:\nSecretory Mary Lister; News Editor Louis Cohen;\nPhotographers Peter Clewer and John Andrews. The new\nEditor, D.C. Kale from India, a Miner, will have a great\ndeal of work taken off his shoulders if their successors\nare as helpful a.s the above retiring staff have been.\nThe second issue of next term will be FELIX No. 50.\nv/e hope to run something of a bumper number. If in s pir ation comes to you over the v.c., please let us have-the\nresults.\nDear Sir, After some years of research, I am now able to present you with my suggestion for along needed I.C. war cry. \"ALBERT, HERBERT, I.C. KEN\nALBERT, HERBERT, I.C. KEN\nWHO ARE WE\nWHO ARE WE\nI. C.a.&T. WHO ARE WE\nI.C. WAAAA A.\" Yours Hoarsely, Rafe. The Hag Coixmttee are very interested in the creation\nof an I.C. Jar-Cry. I.C. has always been lacking in this essential complement to student high spirit. Felix will print any promising suggestions it receives, and the Rag\nCommittee will call a meeting to decide on the I.C. cry.\nHere is a chance for a student to make history, so let the efforts pour in. VIEWPOINT WHAT IS GOING ON? It is very easy to criticise decisions which Ir-ve\nbeen taken, ana it is singularly useless. Imperial\nCollege P as been asked to 3rb m. it pir ns for its expansion,\nbased on the assumption t lrt we are to have ri or it y over\nether claims for land and bu ili ing is they be coir\navailable. V/e have a chance of influencing decisions\nbefore they are mode, a. nd this makes the absence of any\nofficial rO vs or views deplorable. T Ve students might\npossibly be able to ra-ke useful suf; es i ions; we may even\nhave one or two food Ideas.\nRumour has it that the post graduate departments -re\nto expand most, and indeed, if we are to provide the best\nmen rather than the merely very good men, it is necessary\nfor u o to have an unequalled post graduate department.\nSuch a department deserves to be filler with the best\ngraduates available, irrespective of their original University or College. Yet personally I should like to\nsee a goodly proportion of them ex. J.C, undergraduates.\nP/ hr.t about them?\nAre our undergraduates a.s highly qualified for their jobs as they ought to be? Wander round a. ny finals ye--r, listen to the Staff, talk to the employers, not one of\nthose groups is satisfied. Yet the present syllabus is a good one. The Boa.rd of Studies and the Externa.1\nix ari in ers are both conscientious bodies. Jievertheless .\non the whole, Imperial College produces, say, the chief\nchemist, rather than the head of department, the technician\nrather than the managing director.\nMuch money is to be spent on expansion. Please\nspare a little for improvement. We hive the opportunity,\nlet us take it. I have two suggestions to make. First I should like to see hostel ac como dati on expanded and to make it compulsory for undergraduates to spend the first two years in a hostel. Secondly, whilst I have no quibble with the\naward of B. Sc's,I should like there to be some non-academic qualification required before an A.R.C.S.) A.R.3.M or A. C.G.I, were awarded. What form this takes is not\nessential, but, for instance, because ability to persuade\nothers that you are right is so essential in life, attendance at a minimum number of Dinners in Hall would be\nreasonable.\nWhat annoys me most is that no suggestion can be\nconstructive until we have some information. Please, will someone tell us what is going on?\nJ. W. Saunders\nOUTRAGE AT VICTORIA STATION. A fellow I know, once remarked that in his opinion Journalists and lower primates had two\nthings in common; big ears and wide' open spaces between them. Now this v rather unkind statement may have been made in a fit of depression, out judging from the reports of the Uag in the news-papers,- ib was entirely justified. For instance, take the\" Star's'1 account of the afternoon's proceedings: \"Meanwhile a free for all developed, with policemen' s helmets flying over the platform. Passengers became mixed up\nwith the scramble, luggage wh s upset, and police men were knocked over.... hundreds of students stood behind the closed gates, shouting slogans including \"Down with France\". The above quote, in any lesser journal than the\" o tar'1 would probably be preceded by such a headline as\" Ugly scenes at Victoria station\", or \" Anti French Demonstration by \u00bb;tu dents\". The fact is that Flee to tree th as some sort of grudge against students in general. my student escapade always meets with the disapproval of Lord Inky nay; in his columns the student always appears as the vicious half breed, the fellow with the co sh, the destroyer of law and order. Nothing could be further from the truth; we are all for law and order( in small doses), and the very sight of a co sh\"akes us positively shiver. The article quoted is one of many articles in a similar vein, all containing similar distortions of the truth. How many policemen were knocked down? - None, but one slipped. How many helmets rolled? une, which event tally ended jo on a most distinguished head in Kensington Gardens, who shouted \"Down with France\"? i rob ably a police inspector who couldn't dodge a flying flour bag.\nHowever, the Press Lords didn't seem to tike a dislike to the female students from heading, who\nafter throwing their caution, clothes and blue stockings to the wind, posed so pr etti lv outside No. lu.\"I suggest that the next time we feel like making a bad name for ourselves, we dress their resident in a Bikini, and take him for a walk\nalong Fleet. j tree t.
