    "content": "\u2018Used to Be Lonely\u2019 is keeping me company\nT\nhis summer\nWhitney released\ntheir second\nalbum \u2013 Forever\nTurned Around. A beautifully intimate project\nfocusing on change in\npersonal relationships.\nIt\u2019s definitely an album\nfor the summer, but I\nbelieve Forever Turned\nAround is just as great at\nwarming the spirit in the\ncold winter months. It\u2019s\nthe musical equivalent\nof mulled cider. For now,\nI\u2019m just going to ramble\nabout my favourite track\non the album - \u201cUsed\nto be Lonely\u201d - because\nof its interesting use of\nlyrical and compositional\nstorytelling.\nThe lyrics very brie\ufb02y\ntouch on well-known\nlove song tropes. When I\nsay \u2018very brie\ufb02y\u2019 I\u2019m not\nbeing hyperbolic, eight\nlines in two verses and\nonly four different words\nin the chorus (you should\nbe able to figure them out).\nThe few words chosen\ngive light to the ideas of\nfinally understanding love\nand having a partner in\nyour corner.\nWhen long days knock\nyou down\nWhen cold winds turn me\nround\nTake me out in to the night\nCause the only way to\nspend our time\nUsed to be lonely\nLonely\nOn paper the lyrics are\nsomewhat depressing,\nyearning for love. To\nfurther twist expectations,\nthe initial chord progression gives the impression\nof a desperately sad song.\nHowever, this is no sad\ntale of love loss but rather\nthat of love gain.\nBecause we\u2019re in the\npast tense we know that\nthe lyrics are describing\nthe transition into something better. So, the focus\non feeling alone doesn\u2019t\nlower the mood horrifical-ly. This, combined with\na counter narration using\nmelody and instrumentation \ufb02ips the feeling of the\nsong on its head.\nWhitney are fantastic\nat using an ensemble\nof guitars, percussion\nand a side serving of\nbrass to give you that\ndewy-gooey-goodness\ncountry songs are known\nfor. As the layers of\nsoftly played instruments\npartner-up, a warm fuzzy\nfeeling begins to fill your\nchest. It\u2019s the growing of\nnew love from the ashes.\nIt\u2019s musical context and\nintelligent storytelling.\nFour words in a chorus\nis all it\u2019s taken Whitney\nto capture a moment of\njoyous entanglement. A\ncelebration of a new era in\na life by acknowledging\nthe previous one.\nThe music video helps\nreinforce these themes\nof transition from being\nalone to being in a rela-tionship. Also, it\u2019s a really\ncute video so you should\ndefinitely check it out.\nThere\u2019s plenty more\nmonths to go until the\ndark blanket of winter lets\nup, and with albums like\nthis by my side hopefully\ngetting through it will be\neasier.\nTwo new tunes for you\nL\nast month LA\nbased Funk\ngroup The\nPendletons released their debut LP: 2\nSteps Away. A delightful\nblend of tight grooves,\nthick bass and slick\n70\u2019s-style horn sections.\nThe record as a whole\ndraws heavily on its funk\nand disco influences,\nwith a distrincly vintage\ncompositional style, still\ntaking advantage of the\npossibilities of modern\nproduction, making it\noccasionally chorus and\n\ufb02ange, a rawer tone would\nbe far more listenable.\nOverall \u2018Priceless\u2019 is an\nimpressive debut, easily\nholding its own against\nhigh rotation club tracks,\ndemanding a listen, and a\nplace on your pre-drinks\nplaylist.\nMUSIC\nGuthrie Ruby\nMusic Editor\nAre you even country if you\u2019re not wearing blue jeans in a truck? // Secretly Canadian\nMUSIC\nFRIDAY, 29TH\nNOVEMBER, 2019 FELIX\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n22\n\u201cIt\u2019s the\nmusical\nequivalent of\nmulled cider.\u201d\nMUSIC\nMiles Gulliford\nMusic Editor\nArtist: The Pendletons\nLabel: Bastard Jazz For\nFans Of: Ohio Players,\nJanelle Monae, Rick James,\nChic. 4 minutes\nLife to Me\n\u2018Priceless\u2019 is the debut\ntrack from Liam Joshua\nEede or LJ.

    "content": "PUZZLES\nFRIDAY, 29TH\nNOVEMBER, 2019 FELIX\n10\nfsudoku@imperial.ac.uk\nA CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis week, Felix sat down with Deputy President (Welfare) Shervin Sabeghi for a second interview, where we\ndiscussed halls rent renegotiations(!) and chased up on the Liberation Reform and Disabilities History Month\nFelix: One thing\nwhich has been\nmaking quite a bit\nof noise is the halls\nrent renegotiations.\nThis is something\nthat involves the\nDPW heavily as it\nimpacts student\nwelfare heavily. What\nare your thoughts\nregarding the price\nhike and the different\noptions, from a welfare perspective?\nFor more details on the\nsituation thus far, see this\nweek\u2019s News section.\nSS: It goes deeper than\nthe obvious financial\nimplication of \u2018rent higher\n= difficult finances = bad\nwelfare\u2019. The different\nbreakdowns of rent prices\nacross different halls can\nhave a big impact on the\nstudent communities\nliving there, as well as\ngeneral accessibility to\nthe university.\nOne important change is\nthat the introduction of\nKemp Porter and closure\nof Pembridge means\nthat the proportion of\nstudents living in South\nKensington-centric halls\n(Prince\u2019s Gardens, Beit,\nWilson, Pembridge, etc.)\nshifts from 73% to 51%,\nwith almost half the bed-spaces being in Acton and\nthus much further away.\nWe need to decide how\nto deal with that \u2013 independently of any overall\naverage price rises, there\nwould still be a discussion\naround prices in different\nhalls with that shift and\nthe split of the student\nbody.\nAt the moment, the\nWoodward halls are\neffectively subsidised by\nthose in South Kensington. It was decided last\ntime these negotiations\ncame around that the ratio\nbetween South Kensington and Acton halls would\nbe 2:1 in terms of price\nper average square metres\nof a room type (or, rather,\na similar metric to that.)\nThis ratio may need to\nbe readdressed, particularly considering that the\nproportion of students in\nSouth Kensington versus\nin Acton will shift so\ndrastically \u2013 rather than\nthree-quarters of students\nproviding a \u2018subsidy\u2019\nto a quarter of students,\nwithout change it would\nbecome half subsidising\nthe other half. Combined\nwith the overall price\nincrease, that would likely\nresult in students in South\nKensington paying ridiculously high rents.\nHowever, reducing the\nratio too much may result\nin there just being no low-cost, more affordable halls\nanywhere in the property\nportfolio. Other factors\nsuch as travel costs, which\ncomes out to around \u00a322\nper week for students in\nActon, also need to be\nconsidered. Finding the\nbalance is something\nwe, as students, need to\ndiscuss.\nIf the ratio is unchanged,\nthen taking into account\nthe overall increase in the\nnumber of bedspaces after\nthe introduction of Kemp\nPorter and closure of\nPembridge, the increase in\nprice on average has been\ncalculated to be around\n12.2%.\nBut there are so many\nfactors to consider. For\nexample, equivalent\nrooms in Southside are\naround 5% more than\nthose in Eastside \u2013 and I\u2019m\nnot sure historically why\nthat is, but we\u2019re looking\nat making that equivalent.\nEqually, there are rooms\nin both those halls which\nlook out on a wall instead\nof onto Prince\u2019s Gardens\nand receive little sunlight\nShervin Sabeghi, the Deputy President (Welfare) // ICU\n\n"

Especially given the\nlowest-common-denom-inator, pure sh*tpost that\nis the front cover for this\nweek. I am become Buzzfeed, destroyer of worlds.\nOr, goodness forbid, am I\n9Gag?\nLook, I know. I\u2019ll\nsave the proper editorial\nfor next week. Promise.\nDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll be a\nproperly spicy take this\ntime. Or, at least, by my\npasty, genetically-weak\nBritish self\u2019s version of\nspicy, which is maybe\u2026\ncinnamon? Ah, at least it\u2019s\na Christmassy flavour.\nRe-reading the above\nparagraph, I\u2019m pretty\nsure this is where my\nown personal psychotic\nbreak begins. Dear Lord.\nThrough the fabric of\nspace and time itself, I\nfeel the collective eye\nroll of you all tomorrow\nas you realise it\u2019s one\nof those Editorials and\npre-emptively flick to the\ncentrefold.\nAnyway \u2013 this week,\nwe present our first\n56-page issue! I just\nwanted to celebrate that\nfact. For those of you who\nread the Editorial, here\u2019s\na little secret \u2013 next week\nis going to blow it out of\nthe water, for the 70th\nanniversary issue (which\nwill publish on the day\nof the anniversary itself,\nMonday the 9th, rather\nthan the usual Friday the\n6th.) Don\u2019t tell all those\npeople who don\u2019t read my\nramblings. There\u2019s a little\npart of me that can\u2019t wait\nfor the despairing cries of\nSudoku-starved Puzzles\nfans when they realise the\npaper hasn\u2019t been distributed on Friday. They\u2019ll\nenjoy their Christmas\npresent from us, not to\nworry.\nButthat\u2019splanned!Fora\nstandard issue, 56 pages is\na lot. It\u2019s a whole tonne of\ncontent, and I don\u2019t think\nwe\u2019ve compromised on\nquality one bit. Felix, both\nin terms of the product\nyou see every week and\nthe society/organisation/\nCULT that lies behind it,\nis really coming together\nthis year after the rough\nstart we had. Sections\nwhich were struggling\nare now booming. It\u2019s\ndiscreetly been a personal\ngoal of mine to hit 56\npages without making any\nspecial request of the team\nfor extra content, and the\nbeautiful bastards have\ndone it right at the end\nof first term.

That\u2019s the\nChristmas present they\u2019ve\ngiven me.\nYes, it required another\nall-nighter in the office.\nYes, I now know the cockroaches by name. Yes, I\nam slowly growing roots\ninto the Editor\u2019s chair and\nam evolving in real-time\nto sustain myself by\nphotosynthesis. Unfortunately, the office is tucked\naway in the basement.\nScrew you, Darwin.\nBut none of that\nmatters! The sheer satisfaction of realising we\nwere hitting that goal\nearlier this week has\nsustained me, like a great\nwhite feasting on a kill,\nsuch that I won\u2019t need to\nfeed again for weeks. It\u2019s\na huge personal milestone.\nWe\u2019ve grown the Felix\nteamtopossiblythelargest\nit has ever been, and all of\nthem have been performing like stars. There are\nthose who get everything\nsorted prematurely on\nMonday, and who label\ntheir files in the proper\nformat so everything is\nnice and tidy to find later.\nThere are the night owls,\nwho are always racing\nthe time pressure at the\nlast second, but pull\nthrough with some of the\nbest content we produce.\nThere are those who have\ngone out of their way to\nbe there on a Thursday\nnight every week to help\nme pull the last bits of the\npaper together, even late\ninto the night. There are\nthe people who are always\nwilling to lend a hand,\neven when I\u2019m asking\nthem to do something\noutside of their specific\nremit. There are those who\nbring snacks to the office,\nor who make us laugh by\nbrainstorming Hangman,\nor who keep an ear to the\nground and help me track\ndown stories.\nYou know them as the\nX Editor, or perhaps even\nas one of the invisible\ncopyeditors who do so\nmuch every single week,\nunacknowledged but for\nthe bottom right of this\npage. I know them for all\nthe amazing things they\ndo that are nothing to do\nwith putting pen to paper,\nbut are fundamental to\nwhat Felix really is \u2013 a bit\nof a second home.\n\u2018Cause I\u2019m not really\ngrowing roots or learning to telepathically\ncommunicate with our\noffice roaches. I just feel\ncomfortable here. That\u2019s\nbecause of the people, the\nteam.\nA\u2019ight, that\u2019s enough\nfor this week. Bit too\nsaccharin sweet. But just\none more time:\nHey, team.\nGood bloody\njob. Thanks\nfor coming in.\n2\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nFRIDAY, 29TH\nNOVEMBER, 2019\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTop 10 Rap Albums of 2019\nWith the end of the year approaching, Hip Hop Soc President Asad Raja takes us through his picks for 2019\u2019s top\nrap projects. The list highlights the strides made in UK rap this year.\nMUSIC\nAsad Raja\nMusic Editor\nS\ntraight up: the\nUK killed it this\nyear. We\u2019ve \ufb01nally\nreached a point\nwhere the best outputs of\nthe rap scene at home is\nlegitimately comparable\nto the best of the US\u2019s.\nAsides from the four\nbanging albums that make\nthis top 10 list, this year\nsaw the release of great\nUK projects like Kojey\nRadical\u2019sCashmereTears,\nDave\u2019s Psychodrama,\nDigga D\u2019s Double Tap\nDiaries, Headie One\u2019s\nMusic x Road (and of\ncourse, high expectations\nfor Stormzy\u2019s upcoming\nHeavy Is The Head too).\nThe US on the other hand\nwas quieter this year, following a stellar 2018.\n10. DiasporaGoldlink\nThis album, though\nnot Goldlink\u2019s best, was\na refreshing balance\nof high-energy, atten-tion-grabbing, and undeniably groovy. Props must\nbe given to some on-point\nfeatures that each seemed\nto bring an appropriate\nreaction out of Goldlink\n\u2013 from his brooding bars\ncoupled with Khalid\u2019s\ndelicate hook on \u2018Days\nLike This\u2019 to his mean de-meanour following Pusha\nT\u2019s bodying of the beat on\n\u2018Cokewhite\u2019 (can\u2019t wait\nfor that collab album).\n9. uknowhatimsayin\u00bf\n- Danny Brown\nuknowhatimsayin\u00bf is\nprobably Danny Brown\u2019s\nleast manic-sounding\nproject. He chooses to\nreplace that aesthetic\nwith a certain shininess\n\u2013 something between a\nlight-hearted disposition\nand grounded self-ob-servation. Short songs\nwith distinct, albeit less\nexperimental than typical,\nproduction coupled with\nDanny\u2019s unique, catchy\n\ufb02ows and personality-\ufb01lled bars make this a\npretty sweet project, easy\nto listen to in one sitting.\n8. So Much FunYoung Thug\nThugger came through\nwith yet another great\nproject to add to his\ncatalogue this year. Aptly\nnamed, So Much Fun\nfeels lively, loose and lit.\nThug \ufb01lls a good number\nof tracks here with\nstraight bars too, without\nslacking on the incredible\ncadences, creative adlibs\nand catchy hooks he has\ncome to be known for.\nAlmost all the features\nsound brilliant too, each\nof them perfectly complementing the production,\nand Thug\u2019s chosen vocal\nstyling. \u2018Big Tipper\u2019,\nfeaturing Thugger\u2019s rising\nstar signee Lil Keed, and\nthe wavy, hypnotising\n\u2018Lil Baby\u2019 are two of my\nfavourite tracks.\n7. Nothing Great\nAbout Britain - Slowthai\nFollowing Slowthai\u2019s\ntrail of singles since 2016,\na couple of which appear\non this album, Nothing\nGreat About Britain seems\nthat bit more purposeful.\nWhere he could very\neasily have made a full\nbody of work in line with\nthe hazy, depressive, lo-\ufb01,\npill-popping midlands rap\nscene vibe heard on these\nsingles, Slowthai chose\nto channel his inherent\ncharisma into a project\nthat is both clashingly\nanarchist and crushingly\nvulnerable. There hasn\u2019t\nbefore been a project from\nthe UK scene quite like it,\nmost likely because there\nhasn\u2019t before been a time\nin Britain like now.\n6. All My Heroes Are\nCornballs - JPEGMAFIA\nOn All My Heroes\nAre Cornballs, PEGGY\nresponds to the experience of fame through a\nnow well-established lens\nof aggression mixed with\nnihilism. PEGGY uses\nhis new vantage point to\nfurther confront and interrogate archetypes in the\nweird modern cesspool of\nshallow thots and rappers,\nmusic industry soul-suck-ers, brazen bigots, and\ninternet-dwelling, pseu-do-liberal closet-racists\nand quasi-incels. Through\nthis all, PEGGY grapples\nwith his own identity over\ncaptivatingly unpredictable instrumentals \u2013 his\nproximity with all these\ngroups seems to make\nhim paranoid of losing the\nability to self-de\ufb01ne.\n5. Hoodies All\nSummer - Kano\nIt makes me mad how\nslept on Kano is in general\n(\u201coh you mean Sully from\nTop Boy\u201d), but this album\nwas particularly overlooked considering how\ngreat it is. The veteran\nwisdom on this album is\nabsolutely golden, and\nthe immersive orchestral\ninstrumentation that it\u2019s\nwrapped in makes for\nan amazing, and very\ncoherent, project. Kano\u2019s\nobservation of the youths\ncut from the same cloth\nhe\u2019s grown from allows\nhim to lend mature, acquainted insight, without\ncoming off as preachy.\n4. Ignorance is BlissSkepta\nThis album is just so\nhard. Front to back, the\nbeats are captivatingly\nicy, mean, and electronic \u2013 static-\ufb01lled bass,\ntapping synths, and\nminimalistic melodies\nthat swell under Skepta\u2019s\nheavy, pronounced\ndelivery make the project\naesthetically brilliant. The\ncontent follows a tight,\nneat arc too \u2013 from cold to\nintense to vicious.\n3. Bandana - Freddie\nGibbs and Madlib\nMadlib and Freddie\nGibbs reuniting was\nbound to produce something as good as this, their\nprevious collaborative\noutput, Pinata, proving\ntheir insane compatibil-ity. Again, soul and jazz\nsampling beats provide a\nback bone for tracks that\nare anywhere between\ngritty, dream-like, or\nsombre, with Freddie\ndelivering con\ufb01dent, in-sightful, story-telling bars\nthat are able to go each\nway. Freddie\u2019s ability to\nmove from the personal\nto the general in his ann-ecdotal and observational\nlyrics is compounded by\nan increased focus on\nblack identity\u2019s strife.\n2. IGOR - Tyler, the\nCreator\nTyler has always had a\ntendency towards concept\nalbums. Though the\nblonde wig, sunglasses,\nand pastel suit rocking\ncharacter IGOR represents\nwas given, on the surface,\nless exposition than characters from his previous\nalbums, the album\u2019s\nnuanced thematic focus\non obsessiveness paints\nthe concept vibrantly. The\nproject details the ability\nof infatuation to transform us into inarticulate\npuppets \u2013 both sonically\nand lyrically presenting\nthe ugliness and the\nheart-harnessing of it in\na rich, painfully honest\nmanner.\n1. GREY Area - Little\nSimz\nThis might be my\nfavourite album to have\never come out of the\nUK rap scene. Young,\nindependent and accom-plished, Little Simz\u2019s\nposition as one of hip\nhop\u2019s living legends has\nbeen solidi\ufb01ed by this\nproject. Every track is so\nthorough: not a minute\ngoes by where it\u2019s dif\ufb01cult to be impressed. The\ninstrumentals, which have\na very beautiful, organic\nquality, perfectly complement Simz\u2019 gorgeous, di-vulging, poetic lyrics. The\nemotions are emphatic\nbut subtle, far ranging,\nand highly mature. Simz\nprovides a lot of food\nfor thought throughout\nthe album, accenting\nthem with the last track\n\u2018Flowers\u2019, a \ufb02awless full\nstop to the journey.\nClockwise from top left: Nothing Great About Britain, So Much Fun, IGOR, Diaspora, Bandana, All My Heroes Are\nCornballs, uknowhatimsayin\u00bf, GREY Area, Ignorance is Bliss, Hoodies All Summer // Wikimedia\n20\n\n"

It also enters\na dangerous territory\nwhere some students feel\nresentment based on the\nidea that they are getting\na sore deal just to benefit\nothers, which just isn\u2019t\nthe whole picture and is\nvery unhelpful in terms\nof having a discussion.\nIf those are the terms we\naddress this on, it raises a\nslew of other issues \u2013 for\nexample, in the South\nKensington halls, the\nroom sizes are not all the\nsame. Some single rooms\nare larger than others. By\npricing them all the same,\nyou could argue that\nthere is already a case for\nsome students within that\nhall \u2018subsidising\u2019 others\nwithin the hall, just by\nvirtue of the fact that they\npay the same for a smaller\nroom. The same goes\nfor the discussion about\nthe view in Eastside and\nSouthside rooms. On a\npractical level, it just isn\u2019t\nhelpful.\nFelix: How do you\nthink moving to this\n50/50 split might\naffect students on a\ncommunity or welfare level? The construction of Woodward has arguably\nbegun to lead to a\nstate of social or class\nsegregation in the\nCollege. What are\nyour thoughts?\nSS: The problem is that\nthis arises as a consequence of wanting to do\nsomething good, which is\nto ensure there is provision of lower-cost housing\nfor students who are on\na smaller budget. On a\nbreak-even model, that\nnaturally causes larger\nprices elsewhere, and so\nclass segregation results.\nWithin that constraint,\nthere is no \u2018correct\u2019option\n\u2013 it\u2019s all a balancing act.\nIt\u2019s a damaging thing to\nthe student community\n\u2013 halls are so influential\nin building student communities in first year, and\nuniversity life is all about\nmeeting different people\nand\ndiversity. Having a situation where people are\nsplit on any demographic\nbasis, such as wealth, is\njust damaging. People\ndon\u2019t integrate well like\nthat. There needs to be a\nfundamental conversation\nabout what we prioritise \u2013\nensuring low-cost options\nor somewhat equalising\nprices to ensure we don\u2019t\nhave wealth segregation.\nFelix: The issues seem\nto stem from the\nCollege\u2019s decision to\ngo with a break-even\nmodel. What do you\nthink about using\na different model,\nwhere the College\ndirectly subsidises\nhalls prices from other revenue streams?\nSS: If there is an option\nalong those lines, they absolutely should \u2013 it is one\narea where it makes a huge\ndifference to students,\nboth in terms of saving\nstudents hundreds or up\nto a thousand pounds per\nyear, but in terms of protecting student welfare in\nterms of accessibility and\ncommunity. The College\nshould be recognising and\nresponding to that \u2013 with\nthe break-even model,\nwe\u2019re in a situation where\nthere might not be any\nacceptable option for\nstudents. I really don\u2019t\nknow whether that is\nan option though \u2013 I\ncan\u2019t say, not having the\nCollege perspective.\nI\u2019m glad it isn\u2019t a decision\nI would make alone \u2013 it\u2019s\none made by students at\nthe Union Council next\nTuesday.\nThe paper being presented to Union Council at\nthe public meeting on the\n3rd of December, in the\nRead lecture theatre, is\navailable online at XYZ.\nThe process there will be\nfor students to discuss\nwhether they accept or\nreject the model provided\nby College. There will\nalso be discussion of\nwhich direction students\nwant to take \u2013 prioritising\nlow-cost halls for accessibility or reducing social\nsegregation by flattening\nprices. The four options\npresented in the paper are\nnot the only proposals;\nthey are a starting point\n\u2013 Council could reject all\nfour options. The ongoing\nprocess if that occurs\nwould also be discussed.\nFelix: Rent renego-tiations are clearly\na huge topic right\nnow \u2013 but you have,\nof course, also been\nworking on other\nthings. Talk to us\nabout progress on\nthe liberation officers\nreform discussed in\nour last interview\n[see issue 1732.]\nSS: It\u2019s more officially\nunderway now.Aworking\ngroup has been set up in\nconjunction with students\nwho are members of the\nCommunity and Welfare\nBoard, which is one of the\nsubcommittees of Union\nCouncil. We\u2019re discussing\nwhat roles currently exist,\nwhat structure exists,\nand what is missing, and\noverall what needs to be\nin place so that liberation\nand community work\nis properly done by the\nUnion.\nWe\u2019re also thinking\nabout whether there are\nspecific groups we are\nneglecting \u2013 for example,\nwe feel we may not be\nrepresenting students\nfrom different economic\nbackgrounds successfully,\nand the specific issues\nthat can face them. As a\nresult, we\u2019re considering\nintroducing an \u2018Equal\nOpportunities Officer\u2019,\nor some such, which is\na role that exists in other\nuniversities as well. With\nthe College\u2019s new Access\nand Participation Plan,\nwhich aims to drastically\nincrease the number of\nstudents from less well-off\neconomic backgrounds,\nwe need someone representing them. Nothing\nhas been decided yet, but\nthese are the directions of\nour early discussions.\nWe\u2019re also looking\ninto structure \u2013 such as\ncreating student advocacy\ngroups with elected committees to work with the\nLiberation and Community Officers on their remits,\nrather than having one\nindividual try to cover it\nall. Hopefully that would\nspread the workload and\nmake it easier to build\nstudent communities \u2013\nrather than having just a\nsingle person trying to\nadvocate for all women\nor all disabled students at\nImperial, for example.\nFelix: You mentioned\nthe Disabilities Officer there \u2013 can you\nshed any light on\nthe Union\u2019s plans to\nsupport Disabilities\nHistory Month?\nSS: Yes! Disabilities\nHistory Month is from the\n22nd of November to the\n22nd of December. The\ntheme this year is hidden\ndisabilities. So, we\u2019ve just\nhosted a talk from Elizabeth Takyi, who set up a\ncharity supporting adults\nwith dyslexia, and will be\nrunning a comedy night\nwith comedians who each\nhave disabilities. There\nwill be staff members\ngiving their profile or\nexperiences based on\nhidden disabilities as well.\nThe focus is on looking at\nhow disability is \u2018more\nthan meets the eye\u2019 \u2013 it\naffects a lot of people who\nare not, for example, in a\nwheelchair.\nA technical Editor\u2019s note, for clarity:\nFigures on the specific running costs and revenue generated from individual halls is not being factored into the discussion. By \u201csubsidise\u201d, the meaning is not that some\nstudents are paying above the break-even point for their specific hall in order for students in other halls to pay below the break-even point. It refers specifically to a metric\nwhich approximately describes how much is charged per square metre of room space on average. The value of a bedspace is not defined by the running costs \u2013 as an\nillustrative and hypothetical example, the cost of building Beit may well have been paid off at this point, whereas the cost of building Woodward may still be being paid\noff. This means that, if one were to look purely at the cost of running Beit, it may be substantially lower than that of Woodward \u2013 because the cost of building would have\nbeen paid off over a long period of time by students in previous years. Despite this, Beit is (arguably) a more desirable location as it is next to campus and does not require\ntravel costs, and so should be priced accordingly. This is similar to saying that how much is left on the mortgage for a property does not define its value \u2013 a house with a\npaid-off mortgage in South Kensington will still cost a lot more per square metre than a house with an ongoing mortgage in Acton. Indeed, a house with the mortgage\npaid off is not free based on the fact someone else previously paid it off! On this basis, the perspective by which the balance is set between different halls is not based on\ntheir individual running costs, but the cost and break-even point of the property portfolio as a whole, as well as other factors such as location, accessibility to the university\n(i.e. providing affordable halls), and so on. See below for further discussion.\n\n"

Unsurprisingly,\nthe manifesto was geared\naround the issue of\nBrexit with the Lib Dems\npromising to unilaterally\nrevoke Article 50 if they\nwin a majority and to push\nfor a second referendum\nif they don\u2019t. The total\nrejection of the result of\na popular referendum can\nonly be viewed as undemocratic even with the view\nthat a general election win\ngives them the mandate to\ndo so as general elections,\nwith this countries \ufb02awed\nFirst Past the Post system\nand all the covert cross\nparty deals are inherently\nless democratic than one\nperson one vote referenda.\nThe Lib Dems appraisal\nof themselves as the\nparty which champions\nthe People\u2019s Vote is completely undermined by\ntheir abandonment of this\nsensible policy in their\nmanifesto. Elsewhere the\nLib Dems promise an\nappealing \u00a37 billion a year\nextra funding for the NHS.\nHowever, they mean to\npay for this extra funding\nby raising income tax by\n1% in ALL tax bands including the poorest people\nwho are least able to pay\nit. With life in austerity\nBritain already so hard for\nso many people, proposing to raise taxes on the\npoor is a uniquely cruel\nthing to do which even the\nTories haven\u2019t gone so far\nas to suggest.\nOne demographic the\nLib Dems seem particularly keen to attract is\nyoung voters with their\npromises to reintroduce\nmaintenance grants for\nthe poorest students and\ntheir controversial Help\nto Rent scheme both of\nwhich are to be paid for\nby a supposed \u00a350 billion\nboost to our economy\ncaused by us staying in the\nEU. The reintroduction\nof maintenance grants is\nparticularly rich coming\nfrom the party who,\nalong with the Tories,\nbetrayed their student\nbase by tripling tuition\nfees in 2010 and saddled\na generation of students\nwith insurmountable debt\n(a policy Jo Swinson\npersonally voted for). In\naddition, the Help to Rent\nscheme, which promises a\n\u00a32000 government loan to\nhelp 18-30 year-olds pay\ndown deposits on rented\naccommodation, amounts\nto nothing more but\ngreater debt for struggling\nyoung people. For me, the\nLib Dem\u2019s promises to\nyoung people ring hollow,\nit\u2019s all a matter of too little\ntoo late.\nLib Dems\nPOLITICS\nJames Thorne\nPolitics Writer\nT\nhe Conservatives\nannounced their\nmanifesto on the\n24th November\nwith the promise to deliver their EU withdrawal\ndeal being central to\ntheir proposals. To the\nConservatives credit\nthe deal is a remarkable\ndemonstration of self-de-ception and hypocrisy,\nhaving previously voted\ntwice against Theresa\nMay\u2019s deal Boris has\nmanaged to renegotiate a\nnear identical deal which\nhe and his supporters\nnow rapturously praise.\nWhere the deal differs\nto Theresa May\u2019s is in\nits abandonment of all\nconcrete promises to\nretain workers\u2019 rights, its\nremoval of safeguards\nfor the NHS post-Brexit\nand in economically\nsevering Northern Ireland\nfrom the rest of the UK\nby leaving Northern\nIreland practically within\nthe EU customs union\nwhilst taking the rest of\nthe UK out. Throughout\nthe campaign Boris has\ncontinually parroted his\nslogan \u2018Get Brexit Done\u2019\nmeant to appeal to voters\u2019\nfatigue with the whole\nBrexit process however\nhis deal does not result\nin the straightforward\nwithdrawal he pretends\nit does. The withdrawal\nagreement doesn\u2019t secure\ntrade deals with the EU\nwhich would need to be\nnegotiated during a 1 or\n2 year transition period\nduring which time the\nUK would still follow EU\nrules and pay money to\nthe EU budget, hardly an\nattractive proposal to the\nnationalistic Brexiteers\nthe Conservatives are\ntrying to win over.\nSecondary to Brexit\nare the Conservatives\nminor social spending\nplans. Core amongst\nthese are the promise of\nhiring 50,000 more nurses\nand building \u201840\u2019 more\nhospitals. Unsurprisingly\nthe pledge of nurses is\nnot clearly costed and the\n40 new hospitals are not\ncosted at all owing to the\nfact they aren\u2019t intended\nto be built next parliament\nmaking it nothing more\nthan an empty promise.\nIf the 50,000 new nurses\nare delivered it will only\njust bring the number of\nnurses per person back to\nthe level before Tory cuts.\nIn fact the entire manifesto can be summed up\nas the vague promise of\nfunding to services which\nthe Tories themselves\nbrought to the brink of\nruin throughout the last\ndecade of their ideological\nausterity.

Wildlifeencounter tourism is not\na new phenomenon, but\nthanks to social media it\nhas steadily gained pop-ularity. Who amongst us\nwould not want to cuddle\na baby tiger, or ride upon\nthe back of an elephant?\nThat is, until the\nillusion is dispersed; in\nsome institutions with\nunscrupulous handlers,\ntourists are oblivious to\nthe fact that many of the\ncaptive animals have been\nabused. Even more abhorrent is the discovery that\nelephants at a resort in\nThailand, where elephants\ncan be seen roaming\nfreely, are the same elephants that perform tricks\nunder the watchful eye of\ntheir masters, sometimes\n\u2018prompted\u2019 with a sharp\nmetal stick, at another attraction mere miles away.\nFor all the visibility that\nsocial media provides,\nnotably advertising\nactivities that were once\nconfined to guidebooks, it\ndoesn\u2019t appear to encompass the view beyond what\nis initially portrayed. Most\ntourists that enjoy a close\nencounter with a tiger are\nblissfully unaware that\nthey may be declawed,\ndrugged, or both. Or that\nthe abundance of cubs\nwaiting to be held and\ncuddled have in fact been\nbred at speed and snatched\nfrom their mothers only a\nfew days after birth. Or\nthat the three performing\nbears and their cubs at\nthe Bolshoi State St.\nPetersburg Circus are kept\nchained to a wall to force\nthem to become strong\nenough to walk on their\nhind legs.\nThe wildlife tourism\nindustry caters to the\npublic fascination with\nwild animals and often\nseeks to maximise profits\nby exploiting animals\nfrom birth until death.\nBottlenose dolphins are\nintegral to an industry\nthat spans the glove;\nswim-with-dolphin institutions utilise dolphins\nboth caught in the wild\nand bred in captivity to\ninteract with tourists.\nThe media increasingly\ndenounces aquatic\nshows featuring dolphins\nperforming tricks, yet\nmany travellers are\nphotographed swimming\nwith captive dolphins at a\nholiday resort, often in an\nall-too-small pool.\nThere is controversy\nsurrounding whether\nestablishments with \u2018high\nstandards\u2019, including\npools filled with ocean\nwater and veterinarian\nstaff on-call, can be\nconsidered humane for\nmarine life. The Humane\nSociety of the United\nStates argue that dolphins\nhave evolved to swim\nvast distances and live in\ncomplex social groups,\nwhich cannot be replicated in the confines of\nan enclosed pool. Often,\nthese animals are placed\ninto unfamiliar groupings,\nmaking communication\nbetween them impossible.\nCoupled with the\nlimited space, and bare\nand sterile surroundings,\ncaptive dolphins experience little mental stimulation which frequently\nsparks frustration, even\naggression.\nConsidering these\nmammals possess incredible intelligence and\nsentience and have been\ndocumented on numerous\noccasions engaging in\nplayful activities like flips\nElephant Sanctuary - Chiang Mai, Thailand // Eva Tadros\nand leaps out of the water,\none begins to draw loose\nparallels to human behaviour and consider whether\nthe same mistreatment\nwould be glossed over\nin the mainstream media\nif the subject in question\nwas a human?\nFelix is recruiting!\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you! We\u2019re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, reporters, computer\nexperts and grammar nerds to join our team.

Today\u2019s victims\nwere familiar faces, they\u2019d\nreceived a gentle 26-7\nspanking a mere 5 weeks\nago, an experience they\nwere clearly unsatisfied\nwith. The naughty boys\nhad travelled far from\ntheir quaint Hertfordshire\nvillage, begging for a\nfirmer hand. We were only\ntoo happy to oblige\u2026.\nThe game started well,\nfrom the very first phase\nSochi\u2019s fifth appendage\ncame swinging through\ntheir back line, catching\nboth centres across the\ncheek. A penalty lead to\nan early lineout, driven\nover the line by the valiant\nforwards of ICURFC.\nHiding at the back of the\nmall, I was able to claim\nall the credit for the third\ntime this season. An easy\nsnipe for FAF followed\nnot too long after, it was\nall going swimmingly.\nBeing the \u2018take no shit\u2019\n\u2018bad boys\u2019 of the South\nEastern BUCS leagues,\nwe inevitably gave away\na series of penalties.\nUnfortunately, being too\nhandsome and doing\nwhatever the f**k we\nwant has its drawbacks\nand saw us defending\na lineout just 5 metres\nfrom our try line. After\nwinning approximately\nZERO lineouts in the last\ngame, Hertfordshire had\ngiven up all conventional\ntactics from the set piece.\nA sneaky short ball and a\nlapse of concentration, led\nto the sweatiest of try\u2019s,\nlifting the opposition\u2019s\nspirit. We were determined to put them back in\ntheir place.\nAfter some sensual interplay between our backs\nthe boys had quickly run\nthe ball out of our own\nhalf with a single strike\nplay, putting Al Amino\nover the line. Jealous of all\nthe attention, the forwards\nfollowed suit, scoring\nfrom yet another driving\nmaul. The tries just kept\ncoming, I\u2019m watching the\nrecording and I still can\u2019t\nkeep count. A particular\nhighlight has to be the\nefforts of Air Marshal\nWheaton who had just\nlanded his single prop\npitch-side not 2 hours\nbefore. Selflessly lurking\non the wing all game had\nfinally payed off when\nhe took off down the\ntouchline, leaving their\nentire backline in the dust.\nA final (and laughable)\nattempt at a tap tackle\nwas shrugged off by the\nfighter Ace, allowing him\nsubstitute for the number\n10 position, had spat his\ndummy out. Not only had\nhe helped us answer the\nage-old question \u2018Who ate\nall the pies?\u2019, he was about\nto bless us all with some\nquality entertainment.\nThe ball had only\nentered his orbit a handful\nof times before he\u2019d had\nenough. His cheeks were\nred raw, hot to the touch.\nThe open palm of the\nImperial men\u2019s 1st XV\nhad struck one too many\ntimes, the toys were firmly\nout of the pram.\nDespite attempting\nto bully our honourable\nscrum half all game,\nEgor wasn\u2019t happy about\nElliot\u2019s reaction. \u201cDon\u2019t\ntouch me!\u201d He whelped\n(to a man the size of his\nbreakfast), scampering to\nthe other side of the field\nwith tears in his eyes. \u201cI\nsaid, don\u2019t touch me!\u201d\nhe exclaimed once again,\nclearly misunderstanding\nthe definition of a \u2018contact\nsport\u2019. The onslaught was\ntaking a toll, and it was\nonly about to get worse.\nThe pummelling\ncontinued, what a sight it\nwas. The final score line\nof 55-10 had us huffing\nour own farts for the\nsecond week in a row. The\nsmell of victory is sweet.\nThe defeated team left the\npremises with mixed ex-pressions.

Then Die\nIt\u2019s Bleak Friday, and you\u2019re all invited to indulge to your doom.\nCOMMENT\nSung Soo Moon\nComment Editor\nI\nt\u2019s the most wonderful time of the year\u2026\nfor the big fat cats\nto cash in on your\nappetite for greed and low\nself-esteem. Christmas\nis around the corner, and\nthe capitalist gods have\nsent their finest to wring\nout every ounce of self-re-spect we have: Black\nFriday. Since its beginnings in mid-20th century\nAmerica, Black Friday has\nevolved to summarise the\ndisheartening toxicity of\nhuman nature. This year,\nI would like to invite you\nall to reconsider the whole\naffair.\nThe only sale you\nshould concern yourself\nwith is the sale of your\nsoul when you subscribe\nto the cancerous rhetoric\nof Black Friday. With\nthe aggressive marketing on all forms of\nmedia it\u2019s hard to keep\nyour head screwed on\nstraight. We\u2019re being\nwaterboarded with the\nlatest must have deals\nand offers that nobody\nasked for - but look!\nThey have 50% off a\nretail price that was\n70% overpriced anyway.\nWonderful. 30% off on\nsome shoes made by thir-teen-year olds in sweat-shops? Awesome. The\nCommunist Manifesto\nin a festive hardcover\nlimited edition? Exactly\nwhat I wanted, Mom! A\nperfect marriage of my\nprivileged upbringing\nand socialist views. It\u2019s\na consume-as-much-as-you-can campaign, and\nthey plan to force feed\nus until we drop dead.\nThe blackest aspect\nof Black Friday is its\nrotting heart. My mind\nis already exhausted by\nthe mental bludgeoning\nfrom the sadomasochis-tic relationship I have\nwith the retail industry,\nand the shopping season\nhas only just started.\nThey\u2019re selling us the\ncoffin and charging for\nthe labour to nail it shut.\nIt\u2019s going to be a bleak\ncouple of weeks for the\nsane.\nFestivities have\nalways had a cynical\nscent in the air. Now\nmore than ever, the\npreconditioned idea that\nwe need material goods\nto feel good and to\nfeel accepted by others\nis deeply depressing.\nBlack Friday is merely\nthe looking-glass that\nallows us to see the\ndisgusting nature of\nhumans. This is not an\nattack on what people do\nwith their money, rather\non the whole attitude\nand culture of materialism that slowly degrades\nmorale and self-worth.\nThe need for stuff is\npreconditioned; the idea\nthat the objects we own\ndetermine our value\nis ingrained into our\ncollective conscience.\nIt feels good to have\nthings - at the time, at\nleast. The emptiness and\nregret come later: these\nworldly collections of\natoms aren\u2019t necessarily the answers to your\nproblems. Be measured\nin your overindulgence,\nbefore you get overwhelmed by it all.\nI urge you not to spend\nyour dollars on more\nglorified doorstops,\nbut to spend your short\ntime on Earth with your\nloved ones; treat them to\na square meal, take them\nskydiving or to a pottery\nclass. Money spent\non experiences makes\nyou far happier than\nmoney spent on physical\nobjects. The bombardment of consumerist\npornography on sight\nat every junction in our\nbusy lives gives us a\nchance to reflect on the\nenvironmental, social,\nand personal impact it\nall has. Whatever the\nlatest offer is, know that\neven the best recreational drugs have a come\ndown.\n\u201cThey\u2019re\nselling us the\ncoffin and\ncharging for\nthe labour to\nnail it shut.\u201d\nFelix is recruiting!\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you!We\u2019re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, reporters, computer experts\nand grammar nerds to join our team.

In all of this\nwe need to be aware of\nour own traumas and the\ntraumas of others, what is\ninternalised, our experiences - especially those of\nour childhoods and formative years - and the many\nintersections present in all\ncommunities.\nI recently started\nre-listening to an old\npodcast series that I was\nhooked on in first year,\nwhen I went through hard\nstruggles and had to move\nhalls. The podcast series\n(Russell Brand\u2019s \u2018Under\nthe Skin\u2019) is one I can\nthoroughly recommend,\nand not a set of interviews\nthat some people would\nthink I naturally gravitate\ntowards: Interviews with\npeople on the left, social\nactivists, feminist authors,\nand philosophers.\nFor those of you with a\nkeen eye for Felix\u2019s news,\nyou\u2019ll have seen in the\n\u2018A Conversation With\u2019\nsection last week that the\nUnion President, Abhijay\nSood, was questioned\nabout my departure - at\nthat point a very fresh and\nmostly unknown fact. For\nthose of you who have\nalready heard, please\nforgive me for reiterating,\nbut for those of you who\nhaven\u2019t let it be known:\nI am resigning as CGCU\nPresident, effective 29th\nNovember. An email is in\nthe works and should soon\nbe going out to the 4200\nstudents we as a Constituent Union represent.\nI am to be succeeded\nby an outstanding Vice\nPresident to the Constituent Union, Fatima Khan,\nwho I wish the best of\nluck. Our selection of a\nnew Vice President (via\ninternal AGM and email\nvoting) will be sent out\nover this weekend.\nI understand that this\nis uncharted waters, as\nresignations and CU Presidents departing mid-term\nis an occurrence of around\nonce-a-decade regularity\n(2009/10 being the last\ntime). I also acknowledge\nthat \u2018co-opting\u2019, as we call\nit, for such a senior role is\nin violation of the Union\nbye-laws. However,\nwe felt in this case that\nnot using eVoting for a\nbroader public vote was\nfor the best. I am sure the\nCGCU committee I leave\nbehind will be open to\nthat if it is what you, our\nstudents, think should\nhappen.\nTo our 17 Clubs and\nSocieties: it has been the\ngreatest honour to be able\nto work with you. Your\nprofessionalism and dedication is what makes the\nstudent experience here at\nImperial so unique for so\nmany.\nTo the engineering\nstudents I was elected\nto represent, the medics\nwho stood next to me at\nthe St Mary\u2019s debate, and\nthe postgrad students I\u2019ve\nassisted in their fights\nwithin the Union and\nCouncil: I am sorry, but\nrepresenting you, through\nyour Unions and ICU in\ngeneral are experiences\nthat will never leave me.\nTo the ICU staff: I am\nsorry that the student\nunion is currently in the\nstate it is in. I really hope\nthat the positive curvature\nimparted by the appointment of Tom Newman,\nthe new Head of Student\nExperience, and the\ndeparture of some other\nstaff members revitalises\nICU \u2013 and enables it to\nbecome the great student\nunion it can be. You all try\nso hard, and as a student\nvolunteer I\u2019d like to thank\nyou for what you do for\nthe student body. I may\nnot have always seen eye\nto eye on some issues, but\nI truly wish you the best\nfor the future.\nSo it is now, softly, that\nI leave you, with much appreciation and admiration\nfor my committee and our\nstudents for what we have\nachieved and the legacy\nthat we continue to build\non \u2013 that from our predecessors of the Central\nTechnical College and the\nCity and Guilds College,\nthe great institution that,\nalong with many others,\nmerged to form Imperial\nin years past.\nGoodbye.\nI\nmperial is a strange\nplace. A week here\ncan be a long time,\nand yet two years can\npass in an instant. I remember when, as a young\nfresher, I rather cockily\nwalked up to the CGCU\noffice, asking about some\nposition they had vacant\nfor \u201cBolt\u201d editor.\nSince then, in the words\nof the replicant Roy Batty\nin Blade Runner: \u201cI\u2019ve\nseen things you people\nwouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d The\nmost talented students\naround me just get fucked\nover by their circumstanc-es. The best of friends\nbecome the most bitter of\nenemies overnight. Such\nis life, and it can be hard\nat points.\nUni life, like Imperial\nand the mighty CGCU,\nis also diverse. I urge you\nto make the most of your\ntime here. Get involved,\nand (although repeating it\nmay make me seem like\na broken record at this\npoint) please take every\nopportunity that comes\nto you to do, and see, and\nlearn. Grow yourself, get\ninto politics and art, literature and psychology - as\nwell the science or engineering or medicine you\nstudy and practice here\nas part of your degrees.\nMoreover learn from your\nmistakes; that is how we\ngrow and develop.\nMistakes, misdemean-ours, misinterpretations,\nand cock-ups happen. We\nall make them, and if you\nask anyone who knows (or\nhas known) me personally\nthen they will know that I\nmake them a lot. For this,\nI am sorry \u2013 in my own\nway. One of the many\ncomments on life I would\nalso like to mention to\nyou now is that nothing in\nlife is black or white. We\nare made of and live in a\nGoodbye\nThe CGCU committee // CGCU\n\n"

While the latter\ntwo were considered\n\u201cgenerally satisfactory\u201d, the hygienic food\nhandling was described\nwith \u201cimprovement necessary\u201d and influenced the\nlow overall score.\nThe officer found\nmice within the Union\nbar and cockroaches in\nthe kitchen, which were\ngaining access via gaps\nand cracks in the building\nas a result of age. Despite\nthe pest problems highlighted in the report, the\nUnion has stressed that\nthis was not the cause of\nthe kitchen closure, which\nwas instead related to\nelectrical faults.\nOther issues highlighted during the inspection\nare currently unknown,\nthough Felix should\nobtain the report written\nby the officer in the\ncoming days.\nJulia Mattingley, the\nHead of Commercial\nServices at the Union,\nclarified that some of the\nissues raised in the report\nwere not fully valid \u2013 criticisms that were levied\nhad, in fact, already been\naddressed,butcouldnotbe\nevidenced at the time. The\nEHO was accompanied\nduring the inspection by\nan agency-hired interim\nHead Chef, covering for a\nlong period of sickness on\nbehalf of the permanent\nHead Chef, and a permanent member of Union\nstaff. Both have now left\nthe Union. The interim\nHead Chef was apparently unaware of certain\nprocesses that had been\nestablished, for which the\nUnion was marked down\n\u2013 inaccurately, they claim.\nThe unfit state of the\nkitchen is, Julia said, partially down to dependence\non agency staff \u2013 describing some of the interim\nHead Chefs that have been\nin place as \u201cdownright\nunsuitable\u201d, and noting\nthat even in the case that\nthey are not, agency staff\nare often transient.\n\u201cWe have had some\nreally fantastic and\nhard-working agency staff\nand similarly we have had\nsome very poor agency\nstaff who didn\u2019t care\nmuch and didn\u2019t control\nthings in the way that we\nwould have liked. This,\nunfortunately, can be the\nattitude of some transient\nworkers who are here\ntoday and gone tomorrow.\nThe level of accountability from an agency\nchef can be different from\na permanent member of\nstaff as there is nothing\nto stop the agency worker\nleaving and not coming\nback at any point.\u201d\nThe Union is taking\nextensive action to rectify\nthe raised issues, both\nwith regards to the EHO\ninspection and the electrical faults. In both cases,\nthey are working closely\nwith the College\u2019s Estates\ndivision, as building infrastructure maintenance\nfalls under their remit.\nA deep clean of the\nspace and the organisation of regular visits by\nRentokil \u2013 pest exterminators \u2013 is being organised,\nas well as a large-scale\nproject to plug the various\ngaps in the building that\nwere allowing access.\nCurrently, most of those in\nthe bar area have already\nbeen tackled.\nWith regard to the\nelectrical faults which\ncaused the kitchen\nclosure, specific details\nhave been revealed. The\ncircuit board could not\ncarry the full electrical\nload of the set of appliances being used in the\nkitchen, thus activating\nthe trip switches \u2013 which,\nacross the circuit board,\nwere only described with\nunclear or outdated label-ling. The labelling is now\nbeing renewed.\nAdditionally, all\nthe equipment is now\nreceiving tests from the\nEstates teams to ensure\ntheir electrical safety\n\u2013 however, the heavi-est-duty appliances need\nspecialist equipment to\ntest, extending the length\nof the process. Additionally, the overall provision of\nelectrical infrastructure is\nbeing assessed, including\ntesting sockets to ensure\nthey work, checking that\nthere are enough sockets\nto appropriately handle\nthe amount of equipment\nbeing used, and that they\nare located in safe places\naround the kitchen.\nOn the administrative\nand staffing side, refresher\ntraining is being delivered\nto staff, staff records are\nbeing updated, and assessments of health and safety\npaperwork are being\nconducted.\nThe extent of these\nassessments means that\nthe Union kitchen will be\nclosed for the remainder\nof term, but Julia stresses\nthe importance of ensuring\neverything is fully up-to-scratch before returning to\nbusiness. \u201cUnfortunately\nthis is not a five minute\njob and we need to ensure\nthat everything is done\nproperly before reopening.\u201d\n\u201cThe officer\nfound mice in\nthe bar and\ncockroaches\nin the kitchen,\ngaining access\nvia gaps and\ncracks in the\nbuilding as a\nresult of age\u201d\n\n"

Fear not - Felix\nhas you covered\u2026\nTRAVEL\nEva Tadros\nTravel Editor\nI\nknow what you\u2019re\nthinking - another\nday, another Brexit\narticle. But if you\u2019re\nanything like us and have\nthe travel bug, then you\u2019re\ngoing to want to read this\none. With Brexit being\ndelayed once again to\nJanuary at the soonest,\nthere\u2019s no better time to\ngrab a bargain and finally\nbook flights to those\nEuropean destinations\nyou\u2019ve always wanted to\ngo to.\nFlights with airlines\nlike Ryanair and easyJet\nhave been able to stay reasonably priced due to the\n\u201copen skies\u201d arrangement\nwithin the EU. Leaving\nwith no deal means the\nUK will need to reach\na similar agreement to\nmaintain these low fares,\notherwise we could be hit\nwith fewer flight routes\nand more expensive\njourneys.\nIf we end up leaving\nthe EU with no deal at\nall, be prepared for longer\nqueues, more customs\nchecks and stamps all\nover your passports.\nAlthough we still have\nour \u201cno deal contingency\nplan\u201d to fall back on\nfor about 12 months,\nofficials at Brussels have\nconfirmed the return of\nstricter border checks in\nthe event of a no-deal\nBrexit. British nationals\ncan also be subject to\nmore rigorous questioning\nat borders, and can be\nrequired to provide extensive information on their\nvisits and stays in EU\ncountries. There has been\nconjecture over whether\nwe will need a European\nTravel Information and\nAuthorisation Scheme\n(ETIAS) document to\ntravel around Europe, but\nmost officials have agreed\nthat even if needed, that\nwon\u2019t come into effect\nuntil at least 2021.\nIt\u2019s not all bad news\nthough - UK nationals\nwill still reserve the right\nto visa-free travel for\nshort stays in the EU (up\nto 90 days), as long as the\nUK gives EU citizens the\nsame rights. British travellers could also potentially\nget to claim VAT refund\non goods purchased in EU\ncountries as well.\nWhat about staying\nsafe whilst abroad, you\nask? UK nationals could\nlose their right to healthcare access through the\nEuropean health insurance card unless a deal\nis agreed upon, meaning\nnot only will you have to\npay for treatment abroad,\nbut you could potentially\nneed to wait longer to be\nseen in emergency situa-tions. You might also lose\nyour right to roaming-free\nmobile phone use, and\nwe might end up having\nto pay overseas mobile\ncharges when using\nour phones in Europe,\nhowever, some mobile\nproviders have promised\nto keep European mobile\nprices in line with prices\nhere at home.\nOne thing we all love\nabout going abroad is how\nmuch cheaper food and\naccommodation usually is\n(okay fine, Paris doesn\u2019t\nreally count here) \u2013 that\nmight be about to change.\nIt is speculated that due\nto the lack of economic\nsecurity following\nBrexit, the value of the\nBritish pound has been\nsteadily dropping, making\nexchange rates worse\nfor travellers - meaning\neverything suddenly\nseems more expensive,\nand our pounds no longer\nstretch as far as they used\nto. The pound still remains\nfairly strong against\ncurrencies like the Polish\nzloty though, so why not\nbook yourself a holiday to\nKrak\u00f3w soon?\nUK EU Brexit // Max Pixel\nBrussels, Belgium // Eva Tadros\n\n"

Opening\nwith rapid wit and banter\nthe play first comes across\nas an entertaining but\nfundamentally shallow\ncomedic experience. The\nmen, all violent criminals,\ncome across more like\nboys than men as they\nswap stories of school,\nAvengers Endgame, and\ntrade sweets.\nIt is only when Grace\n(Andrea Hall), their\nteacher, comes in and\nbeginstryingtoteachthem\nhow to burp a baby that\nthe voids of these men\u2019s\nown childhoods emerge.\nAll three of them grew up\nwith absent fathers and\nthe theme repeats itself in\nthe next generation. The\ntragedy that they will all\nbe absent from the births\nof their first children,\ndespite them trying to be\nbetter, is present in all of\ntheir faces even if it is\nnever directly addressed.\nIn fact, Cain (Josh Finan)\nthe Liverpudlian motormouth has already given\nup. \u201cLike we\u2019ll ever be\ngood fucking dads,\u201d he\nshouts.\nThe joking moves\nseamlessly from how\neasy it was to get young\nteachers to cry to discussions of how best to slit\nyour wrists (sideways\nfor attention, lengthwise\nfor real) and your heart\ngoes out to these boys\nwho have been so cast\naside from society that\nthey are where \u201cpeople\nget sent\u201d and there is no\nlower to fall.

Not only\ndo we oversee our own\noperations, but also act\na management group for\nmultiple societies, including the departmental\nsocieties of our faculties.\nHell, my committee and\nI have a duty to represent\nthe interests of all 3000+\nnatural sciences students.\nAll this being said,\nyou\u2019d imagine that ICU\nwould ensure we\u2019re\nadequately prepared for\nour roles. Maybe provide\nme and my committee\nwith a bit of training and\nensure we at least had a\nbasic handover. As you\nmight\u2019ve guessed from\nthe title of this article, that\nnever happened.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong,\nICU tried to get me\ntrained. They run a union\nvolunteer training session\ncalled \u201cOfficer Academy\u201d\nat the end of the academic\nyear. Unfortunately, it was\non my final day of second\nyear exams, so I couldn\u2019t\nmake it. To add insult to\nMost of the planning for\nFreshers\u2019 fortnight occurs\nover the break, and I had\nabsolutely no clue what\nI was doing, but at least\nI had my predecessor\u2019s\nhandover to look forward\nto, right?\nWell, my handover\nconsisted of being led\ninto a study room, having\nmy responsibilities\nquickly explained to me\n(albeit with the aid of a\nwhiteboard), and a short\ngoodbye. And of course,\nthere was no handover\ndocument, so if I forgot\nsomething, then tough\ntitties.\nFortunately, with the\nhelp of a few experienced\nunion volunteers, (thanks\nagain Lloyd, Michaela and\nAishy) I was able to learn\nmost of what I needed to\nknow. However, if I had\nbeen less fortunate, Fresher\u2019s fortnight, or maybe\neven the RCSU, might\u2019ve\nbeen an absolute mess.\nThere were other\nincidents regarding a\nfailure to receive training.\nTypically, constituent\nunion presidents are\ninvited to attend certain\nsessions of the officer\ntrustee training. For some\nunknown reason, we were\nnot invited this year. ICU\nalso planned a CU-president-specific training day\nnear the beginning of this\nacademic year, but they\ncancelled it a few days\nbefore it could take place.\nIf ICU wants us to do\nour jobs competently,\nthey should give us proper\ntraining, not force us to\nlearn by trial and error,\nor by asking the other\nvolunteers. Not only\nis the current system a\nnightmare, but it feels like\na goddam lottery, with the\ngrand prize being a decent\nhandover.\nThe strange thing is,\nICU should have a pretty\nsignificant incentive to\ntrain us. We are all serving\nthe same students, and if\nthe CUs do their jobs well,\nthey can take some of the\nload off the ICU.\nGiven that we are\nnearing the end of the\nfirst term, the answer\nto \u201cWhen am I going to\nbe trained?\u201d is probably\nnever. However, the\nUnion president, Abhijay\nSood, has promised to\nimprove the training for\nnext year, so I guess that\u2019s\na plus.

Leave the pasta in the sieve so you can use the same pot to cook the rest\nof the dish.\nWhile the pasta is boiling is a great time to slice the garlic and chop the parsley\nIn the pot which had the pasta, add the olive oil and turn on the heat.\nYou want to make a layer of oil at the bottom of the pot, but you can use less oil if you prefer\nhowever this might result in the pasta feeling a little dry.\nOnce the oil is HOT, add the sliced garlic, salt, pepper, and half the parsley - mix until the garlic\nis golden then add the chilli flakes.\nAdd the pasta, the pasta water, and the remaining raw parsley and mix!\nPlate up, take a pic for your story, and munch.

The legislation\nmakes it unlawful for any\ntrade union to take action\nif the voter turnout does\nnot hit a threshold of 50%\n- regardless of the support\nfor action amongst voters.\nThe Imperial UCU ballot\nfrom the start of this year\nonly had a turnout of\n47.99%, making it illegal\nfor them to take action\ndespite the 72% support\n\u2013 a result that Michael\nsays had UCU members\n\u201cfurious and incandescent.\u201d\nThe actions follow\nfrom the strike action\nregarding USS pension\nschemes in 2018, after a\nproposed shift to a less\nsecure model, which\ncaused disruption to\nImperial students as\ncontact hours were can-celled. The strikes now\nare due to disputes over\nboth the pension scheme\n\u2013 which has proposed\na rise in contribution of\neach member\u2019s salary to\n9.6% - as well as over pay\nand working conditions.\nThe concerns around\nworking conditions are\npredominantly to do with\nexploitation of staff. Many\npostdoctoral or teaching\nfellow staff \u2013 particularly\nthose on \u2018precarious\u2019, or\nfixed-term rather than\npermanent, contracts do\nnot have provision for\nmany parts of the work\nthey end up doing. Many\nresearch grants do not,\nfor example, contain pay\nallowance for teaching\nduties \u2013 but many staff\nend up taking on those\nduties \u2018for free\u2019 anyway,\nin an effort to build CVs,\nwhich mainly benefits\nthe university. At the\nsenior level, professors\nare often left feeling like\ntheir job descriptions are\ntoo open-ended, meaning\nextra work often gets\nadded into their responsibilities on an informal\nbasis that accumulates\nover time until it is un-manageable.\nChris Jackson, a\nmember of the UCU\nand Professor of Earth\nSciences, expanded:\n\u201cConcerns related to\noverwork must be considered in the context of pay.\nIf you get paid \u00a3200,000\na year to work 12 hours\na day in the City, perhaps\nyou can reconcile this\nsort of thing. But if your\nsalary is low and if this\nmakes living in London\ndifficult, people rightly\nfeel unhappy, exploited\nand undervalued. Being\noverworked and overpaid\nis an issue at all career\nstages, although some\nsenior management are\non six-figure salaries such\nthat they are not exposed\nto this so much.\u201d\nThe Imperial UCU\nballoted only on the\nissue of pensions at the\nstart of the year, rather\nthan on pensions and\npay like many other\nUCU branches, because\nImperial College management seceded from\nnational negotiations on\npay fourteen years ago.\nThis means that Imperial\nstaff negotiate their pay\ndirectly with the College,\nrather than in the nation-al-level negotiations that\naffect pay scales for most\nresearchers and lecturers\nin the UK.\nTypically, negotiations\nabout pay are carried out,\nand at the end an offer\nis presented to the Joint\nTrades Unions, comprised\nof the UCU as well as\nUNISON and Unite, who\nrepresent other groups of\nstaff at the College. This\nyear, the offer was an\nincrease of 2% for salaries\noverall, representing a\n\u00a3600-1400 award for in-dividuals. The unions can\nthen decide whether to\naccept or reject the offer;\nin the latter case, as was\nthe case this year, typically negotiations would\nreopen \u2013 or alternatively,\nthe College has the power\nto simply impose the offer\nas it stands.\nThis year, neither\noccurred. After the re-jection, the College put\ntogether four alternate\noptions instead \u2013 each\nwith the same 2% total\nincrease, but distributed differently among\ndifferent pay scales \u2013\nwhich were all in turn\nrejected again. However,\naccording to a College\nspokesperson, UNISON\nand Unite indicated an\n\u201cinformal preference\u201d for\none of the options if any\nwere to be imposed. The\nCollege then decided to\nimpose that option rather\nthan open negotiations\nagain.\nFrom the UCU per-spective, Michael says,\nthis imposed scheme was\nworse than the original\nproposal, as it left many\nUCU members with a pay\nincrease below the rate of\ninflation \u2013 which in real\nterms is equivalent to a\npay cut.\nAdditionally, the offer\nwas imposed at a time\nwhen it was too late for\nballots to be completed\nbefore October. However,\nthere is a possibility of\nconducting another ballot\nvote on both the pay and\npension issues now that\nthey have been established \u2013 and that is the\noption the Imperial UCU\nhas taken, serving notice\nto College of that fact on\nTuesday 26th and opening\nthe new ballot next week.\n\u201cIf management take\nthe high-handed approach\nthat they can ignore agreed\nprocedures, can rip-up\nregulations and do so in\na totally irresponsible\nfashion, then people have\nto say something about\nit. I don\u2019t know if they\nweren\u2019t thinking about\ntheir actions or if it was\njust incompetence. Maybe\nboth. I\u2019m almost speechless trying to rationalise\nwhy they have done this,\u201d\nhe said.\nChris further questioned the conviction of\nCollege management to\nmake meaningful change\nto pay and workload:\n\u201cWe staff understand\nthere are external market\nforces at play that constrain finances. However,\ncollege management need\nto recognise that it is us,\nthe students and staff, that\nhave built and sustain the\ncollege\u2019s reputation.

Why?\nThe reason is the preservation of the Petrodollar\nsystem, the currency in\nwhich most oil is traded.\nThe demise of this system\nwould bring about a colossal powershift from West\nto East: potentially crashing oil prices, currency\nvalues, and stock prices,\neclipsing the 1930\u2019s Wall\nStreet crash and 2008\nFinancial Crisis. Not only\nwould it shift the world\u2019s\n\ufb01nancial epicentre, it\nwould impact basic social\nvalues such as freedom of\nspeech and press. What\ncould trigger this crash?\nThe principal adversary\nof the Petrodollar system\nis Chinese President Xi\nJinping, who is bidding\nto boost his country\u2019s\ndominance on the world\nstage and repealing the\neconomic slowdown that\nChina faces. A change in\nWashington\u2019s strategy in\nthe Middle East and new\ninvestments by Beijing\ncan potentially trigger a\npowershift in this region\nand possibly the world.\nThe Petrodollar system\nwas born in 1973, at\na time when oil prices\nand in\ufb02ation were rising\nrapidly in the US due to\nincreasing debt caused\npartially by the Vietnam\nwar, increased domestic\nspending and a government de\ufb01cit. To prevent\na potential collapse of\nthe dollar, the Nixon government decided to end\nthe convertibility of the\nUS dollar into gold, thus\nA primary example is\nNazi Germany, a country\nthat lacked natural oil\nresources and was forced\ninto producing synthetic\noil from coal, a very\nexpensive process. The\nextensive availability of\noil to the Allied Forces\nand the lack of availability of oil for the Axis\nPowers arguably resulted\nin the eventual British and\nAmerican victory over\nNazi Germany in World\nWar 2. For the Peoples\nRepublic of China, the\navailability and leverage\nover the oil economy is\ncrucial in its ambitions\nto become a Global\nSuperpower. Currently\nChina is the world\u2019s\nbiggest coal user (using\nmore coal than the rest of\nthe world combined) and\nnow, the world\u2019s biggest\noil importer (see graph).\nConsequently, this leaves\nthe country in a very vulnerable position \u2013 clearly\nseen as 80% of Chinese\ndebt is denominated in\nUS dollars. Moreover,\nthe US dominance in\nMiddle East puts Chinese\ntrade at risk. China is\nin a very weak position Graph of crude oil imports in China, India, and US // Oil 2018 Report\nmaking the US Dollar the\nworld\u2019s \ufb01rst modern \ufb01duciary currency. In 1974,\nthe American government\nsigned a bilateral agreement with Saudi Arabia\nstating that all oil would\nbe sold in dollars, and in\nreturn, the Kingdom of\nSaudi Arabia gained US\nmilitary protection and\nassistance. Under Saudi\nin\ufb02uence, other countries\nin the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) also agreed\nto sell oil in dollars. This\nwas a time when OPEC\ncountries were keen on\nUS protection, due to\nSoviet intervention in\nAfghanistan and the fall\nof the Iranian Shah. Thus,\nthe Petrodollar system\ncame to life.\nOPEC countries gain\nmany bene\ufb01ts from\ntrading with the Petrodollar system, such as being\nable to invest in secure\nAmerican investments\nrather than volatile local\nprojects. Even more bene\ufb01cial for the United States\nis the extra liquidity and\nforeign capital given to its\n\ufb01nancial markets - known\nas Petrodollar recycling.\nThese recycled dollars\nkeep interest rates low\nand promotes in\ufb02ation\nfree growth by effectively\nallowing the US to borrow\nits own money. This\nsystem has made the US\ndollar the world\u2019s global\nreserve currency, with\nover2/3ofglobalcurrency\nreserves in dollars and\nover 40% of global debt\nbeing in dollars. This\nstatus enables the US\nto be a global economic\nhegemony and the world\u2019s\nonly superpower.\nAvailability and\nleverage of natural resources \u2013 especially oil\n\u2013 is incredibly important\nfor a nation and can be\nseen throughout history.\nOil Currencies: The Fight for Global Dominance\nThe Petrodollar system, whereby oil from OPECs are traded only in US Dollars, holds the key to American global\ndominance.

If\nyou\u2019re struggling a little to\nget those elusive matches\nfrom people that are at\nleast more than a 3/10,\nthen you aren\u2019t doing\nTinder right. You gotta\nlearn that sometimes,\nreality needs embellish-ing. A few exaggerations\nwon\u2019t hurt. Photoshop\nout those acne scars. Give\nyourself a jawline.

You\u2019re\nimagining you and your\nfuture spouse\u2019s lives\ntogether and you ask them\nout on a date. Where do\nyou bring someone on\nthe \ufb01rst date, you ask.\nOur answer: somewhere\nyou can really make your\nintentions known without\nviolating your parole\nagreement. That means,\nof course, any caf\u00e9 at least\n100m from a school.\nStep 4: It\u2019s date day!\nYou\u2019ve buffed up your\nmole and smeared Tipex\non your teeth.

Suddenly, they\nwalk in, lightly brushing\ntheir hair aside in exactly\nthe manner you predicted\nfrom stalking their Facebook, Instagram, Yelp and\nGoogle Plus accounts.\nYou are overwhelmed by\nFeelings.\nStep 6: First impressions are hard, particularly when you\u2019ve given\nsomeone such unrealistric\nexpectations, of beauty,\nintelligence and number\nof teeth. Instead, a better\ncourse of action is to do\nnothing. They can\u2019t form\na bad \ufb01rst impression if\nthere is no impression at\nall.\nStep 7: Your date\nbegins to look anxious,\nsearching for their ideal\nonline match.

They nonchalantly saunter up to your date\nand ask them a question.\nWithin minutes they are\nboth chatting, laughing,\n\ufb02irting.

An hour passes\nand they exchange\nnumbers, and make to\nleave. You hear your dates\nnumber and write it down.\nLooking for a date?

You tell them\nthat you hope you never\nsee them again and that\nthey have a terrible per-sonality. You have clearly\nupset them dreadfully.\nStep 10: You have\nruined something beau-tiful.

The investment\nis not limited to \ufb01nancial\ncapital (cash), it can also\nbe in a form of expertise,\ntechnical and non-techni-cal. The purpose of such\ninvestments is to achieve\nan unsually high rate of\nreturn or ROI (Return on\nInvestment). This refers to\nmaking signi\ufb01cantly more\nmoney for every pound\ninvested. For example, if\nyou invested \ufb01ve pounds\nin a company\u2019s stock;\nyou would hope that your\n\ufb01ve pounds becomes \ufb01ve\nhundred pounds after\nselling that stock. In the\ncase of expertise, it could\nbe seen as trading things\nof signi\ufb01cant value to the\nstart-up or small business\nin return for equity.\nThe risk in these\ninvestments are signi\ufb01cantly higher than private\nequity, but the potential\nupside could make such\ninvestments more lucra-tive. Imagine investing\nin Google when it was a\nstart-up and owning ten\nper cent of it. It wouldn\u2019t\nhave cost over a thousand\ndollars per share, like\nit does now. This also\nbrings us to the point\nthat such investments\nare cheaper compared to\nprivate equity because\nprivate equity refers to\ninvestment in more established companies.\nVenture capital is\nalso an important part of\nthe start-up ecosystem\nbecause the risk associated with a start-up is high\nand thus makes it dif\ufb01cult\nfor start-ups to obtain\nloans and other debt instruments from traditional\nbanks. However, having\nventure capital also introduces the in\ufb02uence of\nnew shareholders to the\nstart-up, this may or may\nnot be desirable.\nIn the news: Female\nFounders on the rise\nThere have been\nconcerns in the past\nthat most venture \ufb01rms\nknowing or unknowingly\nfund a signi\ufb01cant majority\nof starts-ups foundered\nor co-foundered by men.\nThis has led to concerns\nthat there could be bias\nagainst female founders.\nHowever, in the recent\nyears, some funds has\nmade a move to fund\nmore female founders or\nin some cases exclusively\nfemale founders. And it\nseems to be paying off.An\narticle in Forbes by Elana\nLyn Gross, titled \u201cThe\nFELIX\nPrivate equity\nYou can think of it as\nequity that is held pri-vately, either by wealthy\nindividuals or \ufb01rms.\nWhere equity refers to\nshares/stocks and this\nrepresents the ownership\nof a company.

In the case\nof public companies,\nthis might result in the\nde-listing of the company\nfrom the stock exchange.\nDe-listing refers to\nremoving the stock from\nbeing publicly traded\non a stock exchange.\nWhen this happens, the\ndelisted company would\nbe considered a private\ncompany.

More accurately,\nthough, it is a collection\nof stories that spotlight\nboth the people practising\nmedicine or driving forwards its advancement,\nand those on the receiving\nend who have profound\nexperiences to share.\nScience Museum\nveterans might recall\nthe previous medical\nhistory gallery which was\ndisplayed in specific time-bound periods, such as\nmedicine in the war era.\nThis new gallery takes\nthe best of the old but is\ncompletely reimagined,\nredesigned, and revamped\nwith items from the\nworld\u2019s most extensive\nmedical archive: the\nWellcome collection.\nReimagined\n\u201cWe wanted to take\na new approach.\u201d Katie\nBaumer, Curator of\nMedicine at the Science\nMuseum, explains the\nMuseum\u2019s masterplan.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone for a more\nthematic exploration of\nour collection and the\nhistory of medicine... So:\nour exploration of the\nbody, our development of\ntreatments, and looking\nfrom a community scale\nof how we deal with\nmedicine as a society.\u201d\nThis thematic presentation is powerful, with\nitems like an alchemist\u2019s\nglassware for boiling up\nbatches of urine placed\nin the same cabinet as a\nmodern-day toxicologist\u2019s\nautosampler, used to run\nblood and urine samples\non for the detection of\ndrugs. Advertisements\nfor cigarettes over the\nlast century are displayed\nside-by-side, showing\nchanges in public perception of the health risks of\nsmoking.\nThe chosen themes\nseem to suit the\nfast-changing, and\narguably, more scientifically complex advances\nof the recent time period\nthan perhaps a traditional\nchronological display\nwould, allowing developments in instrumentation\nfor understanding disease\nor human health to be\nshowcased. There\u2019s\nX-ray crystallography,\nDNA sequencing, and\nelectroencephalography\n(ECGs) \u2013 by grouping\ninto subthemes such as\n\u2018seeing\u2019 or \u2018measuring\u2019,\nthe generalist visitor can\nunderstand the technique\nas an extension of more\nfamiliar ways of seeing\nand measuring. And for\nthose of you who thought\nphysiology dominates\nmedical history, it\u2019s gratifying to see the advances\nin fields like biochemis-try, molecular biology,\ntoxicology or analytical\nchemistry take a bow!\nRedesigned\nThe exhibition is not\njust redeveloped in space,\nbut also redesigned in\nexpression. This gallery\nincorporates various interactive and multimedia\nelements, including a\n\u2018battle the virus\u2019 game\nstation and a Victorian\nPharmacy you can enter\nand \u2018shop\u2019 round. But for\nme, the most compelling\nwere the videos and\naudio tapes of individuals\ntelling their own stories,\nsuch as Caroline Presho,\nwho discovered she had\nthe BRCA 2 gene (which\nincreases her risk of\ndeveloping breast cancer\nlater in life), and chose\nto undergo a preventative\ndouble mastectomy.\nStrong stuff \u2013 especially\nwhen I realised the nearby\ncabinet displayed a cast\nof her breasts before the\nmastectomy.\nIt is really something to\nexperience the exhibition\nfrom within pockets of\npersonal stories \u2013 and\nthere are many more than\nCaroline\u2019s to hear. In fact,\nthe whole exhibition is\nconnected by the strong\nsense of community and\nhow we as individuals\ninteract with medicine and\nhealthcare. The emotional\njourneys we go through\nin health scares or battles\nwith disease can generate\nas much hope and fear as\na religion inspires, and\nthis sense comes through\nin many of the stories on\noffer.\nRevamped\nThe history of medicine\nhas a few staple facts that\nalways get trotted out; the\ninvention of penicillin\nby Alexander Fleming,\nthe first vaccination for\nsmallpox by Edward\nJenner, the discovery of\nthe double helix of DNA\nby Watson and Crick (and\nRosalind Franklin\u2019s data,\nas we now know) \u2013 as\nBaumer calls them, the\n\u2018big boys\u2019.\nBut my favourite part\nof the exhibition was the\nwealth of new stories\nit tells \u2013 and stories of\nwomen. Those big boys\nare still there, but they\naren\u2019t, for once, the focus\nof their cabinets. Instead,\nthey are joined by a litany\nof women counterparts.\nSo, when you visit, you\nmight need to make room\nin your famous female\nscientist list, right there,\nbetween Marie Curie and\nFlorence Nightingale.\nNow you can add the two\nX-ray sisters, Edith and\nFlorence Stones, who\nmade their own way to\nthe frontline in WWI with\nmobile X-ray machines\nafter being denied entry\ninto the Red Cross on\ngrounds of gender; and\nDorothy Hogkins, whose\nwork in X-ray crystallography was key in\ndetermining the structure\nof insulin and advancing diabetes treatment.\nThere\u2019s the American\nMary Jacobi who disproved the prevailing\ntheory that women\u2019s\npulses weakened during\nmenstruation. Or Edith\nWiddowson, who took it\nupon herself to undergo\nextreme diet experiments\nto support the Government\u2019s wartime food\nration policies.\nIt was my personal\nfavourite, however, that\nreally struck home; brain\nspecialists Vivian Davey\nand her husband William\nWalter, who built the\nfirst autonomous robots\nmodelled on the human\nbrain. To see the description written that way\nmade me hopeful that this\ngeneration of children\nbrought to the Science\nMuseum on school trips\nor family fun days would\ngrow up seeing both men\nand women they could\nconnect with in their experience of science.\nRe-visit\nI\u2019m sure the Science\nMuseum is a regular\ntrip for many Imperial\nstudents, given its prox-imity, and of course a few\nother vital student qualities like being dry, warm,\nand most importantly,\nfree. But even if it wasn\u2019t,\nI\u2019d highly recommend the\nnext time you come out of\nthe tunnel on Exhibition\nRoad, make a right turn\n\u2013 the Science Museum\ncertainly has.\nA weird and wonderful item // Christine Parry\nInsulin // Science Museum\n\n"

No, it\u2019s\nnot an illegal substance\nthat alters your thinking\ncapabilities to make you\nhighly intelligent; though,\nit does come close!\nIA is closely linked\nwith AI, but it takes a\nbackseat in making decisions for you; to put it\nsimply, with IA, you\u2019re\nat the wheel. Intelligence\naugmentation systems\nanalyse information and\npresent it for your consid-eration. And, no, it\u2019s not\ncapable of \u2018taking over\nthe world.\u2019 To think of it,\nIA plays more of an as-sistant-like role, focused\non helping humans rather\nthan automating tasks to\neffectively replace human\nintervention.\nShifting to augmented\nreality, or AR, it made a\nsurprising comeback over\na year ago and looks to\nbe a way we interact with\ntechnology as we head\ninto the future. Some may\nconfuse virtual reality\nwith augmented reality;\nvirtual reality, commonly\nknown as VR, places\nyou in virtually created\nenvironments where\nyou interact with virtual\nentities. In contrary, as\nyou might have already\nseen through your\nas well as additions to it.\nEven Peter Parker, for\nthat matter, used the same\napproach for creating his\nsuit in the recent \u201cSpiderman: Far From Home\u201d.\nThe only exception is\nthat instead of using holograms as an interface, AR\nheadsets or smartphones\nare used. Soon, in the next\nfew years, the technology\nbehind AR may make\nits way into our normal,\neveryday glasses.\nNow, combine the two,\nand think of the amazing,\nrevolutionary product\nformed, at least in theory\nor imagination. Well,\nhonestly, I think it\u2019s the\nperfect combination in\nterms of its wide array of\npractical use cases. It\u2019s no\nwonder why the industry\nis shifting towards augmented reality oriented\ntechnologies, especially\non the manufacturing\nand business side of\nthings. From Microsoft\u2019s\nHoloLens 2 and Google\u2019s\nGlass Enterprise Edition\n2 to Apple\u2019s rumoured,\nupcoming AR glasses, it\u2019s\neasy to observe a pattern:\ncompanies are creating\nmore personal devices.\nWhat started with laptops\nand smartphones is now\nslowly moving on to our\nwrists in theformof fitness\ntrackers and smart-watch-es. Looks like the step\nafter that is integrating the\nsame technology found\nin smartphones as well\nas smartwatches into our\nglasses!\nNeed another example?\nAgain, coming back to\nIron Man and his infamous\nsuit of armour, think of\nthe heads up display he\nuses to analyse and gain\na better understanding of\nhis environment as well\nas on the state of his suit.\nAlternatively, you could\nconsider the glasses worn\nby secret agents in the\nmovie \u201cKingsman: Secret\nService\u201d and \u201cKingsman:\nGolden circle,\u201d which\nserve to provide a means\nof communicating with\nother agents and acess\nto essential information.\nIn general, the notion of\ncombining AR and IA\nhas existed in the context\nof films, video games,\nbooks, and series for a\nlong time. Heads up\ndisplays are especially\nused a lot in games, where\ninformation regarding\na player\u2019s environment\nand statistics are vital to\ncompleting the game.\nImagine completing\nMinecraft without health\nand hunger bars or even\nplaying a game of competitive CS:GO without\na mini-map. Games such\nas Pokemon Go and\nMinecraft Earth have\nshown the potential of AR\nin creating a interactive,\nimmersive real-world\nexperience; however, the\nsoftware, or hardware for\nthat matter, isn\u2019t optimal\nfor a seamless user experience when considering\nit as a general, standalone\nplatform.\nCurrently, Google\u2019s and\nMicrosoft\u2019s implementations of this set of devices,\nas previously mentioned,\nare mainly geared towards\nimproving productivity in\nthe business and manufacturing segments. This\ncould be thought of as a\n\u2018testing ground\u2019 to tune\nthe product. However, its\nuse in the business space is\nnot to deny that it can\u2019t be\nused from a commercial\nstandpoint; rather, it\u2019s a\nmatter of picking the right\ntime. Building third-party\nsupport is key for the\nsustenance and popularity\nof this product in the commercial space. In addition,\nthe quality of the product\nand the services it offers\nmakes or breaks the deal\nfor consumers.\nIt\u2019s often amazing to\nvisualise a future where\nwe would be constantly\nconnected with the world\nwithout having to look\ndown at our smartphones.\nImagine the most general\nuse cases where virtual\narrows help guide your\nway to a destination or\neven show you health\nstatistics, time, weather,\nand even notifications on\na virtual sidebar! It\u2019s great\nto witness the actual development of technology\nthat are commonplace in\nfictional environments.\nMore than that, it\u2019s truly a\ngreat and exciting time for\nthe tech space.\n\u201cIA plays\nmore of an\nassistant like\nrole, focused\non helping\nhumans\u201d\nsmartphones, AR adds,\n(rather projects overlays\nof) virtual elements\nto the actual, physical\nworld around you. Need\nan example of how this\nwould pan out in the near\nfuture? Look no further\nthan the holographic\nprojections used by Iron\nMan to create his suit,\nAR Preview Of Apple Park// Patrick Schneider - Unsplash\nHoloLens 2 // Microsoft\n\n"

Maybe if there\nwas some competition,\nwe\u2019d actually have to do\nour jobs properly. The\nhorror!\u201d\nAlthough the market\nwas initially set up in\nresponse to the demand\nfor study drugs to get\nprocrastinating students\nthrough exams, over the\npast three months, it has\nrapidly branched out into\nmany other crucial aspects\nof student life. One\nanonymous black-market\nracketeer told Negafelix\nin an exclusive inter-view, \u201cYeah, we can get\nsomeone counselling\nsupport almost immedi-ately, with almost no wait\ntime. It\u2019s just a matter of\nmeans testing what people\ncan afford, with those\nthat need the service and\nare better off subsidising\nthose that wouldn\u2019t be\nable to. Pretty amazing\nhow many counsellors\nyou can hire when you\nrun that funding structure.\u201d Another vendor told\nNegafelix that, \u201csince the\nclosure of the Union bar,\nwe\u2019ve been making an\nabsolute mint. Students\nwill pay almost anything\nto get their hands on curly\nfries or a tasteless greasy\npizza. Some don\u2019t just pay\neither.

Methane\nis an incredibly potent\ngreenhouse gas and a lot\nof it comes from cows, so\nthis policy may well be\njusti\ufb01ed \u2013 however it is\nunclear how this tax will\naffect consumers. If meat\nand dairy prices rise and\nare made unaffordable\nfor people, then they may\nwell be forced to switch\nto a more environmen-tally-friendly vegan diet\n\u2013 however this does seem\nlike passing the cost on to\nordinary working people\nwhen another policy could\ntry and achieve the same\nresult without punishing\nthose who can\u2019t afford to\npay more in tax.\nThe Greens have also\npromised \u00a32bn a year\nfor apprenticeships and\ntraining for those transitioning to green jobs.\nWith \u00a32.5bn promised\nfor improved cycle\nroutes, the Greens aim to\nmake cycling a safer and\nfriendlier option. Despite\nthis, there are no policies\non how they will improve\nand promote public\ntransport usage and how\nthey will do this while the\nmajority of public transport is owned by private\ncompanies.\nGreen have also\nproposed a Universal\nBasic Income of \u00a389 a\nweek to replace existing\nbene\ufb01ts. However, a UBI\nis meant to get rid of the\nadministrative burden of\nmeans testing found in\nmost welfare systems, yet\nthe Greens\u2019 UBI proposal\nhas means testing in it\nto provide families, the\nelderly, and disabled\npeople with more money.\nThis begs the question\nof why they want to\nintroduce an expensive\nUBI programme while\ngetting rid of one of the\nmain bene\ufb01ts of it, which\nis to reduce administrative\ncosts for the state.\nThe Greens have been\ncriticised in interviews\nrecently for their bold\nborrowing and spending\ncommitments, however\nmy view is that when\ndealing with the existential crisis of climate\nchange, we can\u2019t really\nafford not to take bold\naction.\nGreen\nPOLITICS\nAnsh Bhatnagar\nPolitics Writer\nT\nitled \u201cIt\u2019s time\nfor real change\u201d,\nthe Labour manifesto certainly\nlives up to that promise.\nLabour have promised\nlarge spending increases\nto combatting the major\ncrises that face our nation\nin the present.\nClimate change is\nfor many, the greatest\nissue faced by humanity.\nLabour have committed\nto 90% of electricity to\nbe supplied by renewable\nsources by 2030.

Free bus travel\nfor under 25s will promote\nthe use of public transport,\nwhich will further forward\nLabour\u2019s environmental\nobjectives. Taking key industries into public own-ership, such as rail, mail,\nwater and the energy grid,\nmakes promoting public\ntransport and decarbon-ising our energy system\neasier, while improving\nthe services and reducing\ncosts for service users as\nvalue will no longer be\nsiphoned off to line the\nwallets of shareholders.\nLabour is also proposing\nto roll out free \ufb01bre optic\nbroadband for all, as\ncurrently only 8% of the\nUK has access to full \ufb01bre\nbroadband.\nLabour aims to raise\nthe minimum wage immediately to \u00a310 an hour,\nstop state pension age\nrises and build 100,000\ncouncil homes a year to\nend the homelessness\ncrisis. With regards to the\nNHS, Labour has committed to making dentistry\ncheckups free and abolish\nprescription charges in\nEngland, giving the NHS\nthe funding it deserves.

Over the years,\nthough, I have learned\na multitude of ways of\ngetting as many games,\nconsoles, and peripherals\nas possible with the limited cash in my wallet. This\nweek I will go over all of\nthese tips and tricks \u2013 as\nwell as which consoles\nI recommend you start\ncollecting for, right now!\nThe first thing you need\nto do before getting into\ncollecting is to decide\nwhat you want to collect.\nI like to collect physical\ngames, especially for\nretro consoles, \u2018complete\nin box\u2019 (which means\nyou have the game, box,\nand instruction manual\nall together). But that\nisn\u2019t the only thing you\ncan collect. Many people\nI know enjoy collecting\nconsoles. The GameBoy\nAdvance, for example,\nhas more colours than I\ncan reasonably list here.\nThe 3DS has a plethora\nof minor variations (2DS,\nnew 3DS and so on) that\ncould cover your entire\nbookcase. Furthermore,\nyou could collect periph-erals! Who remembers\nthe tennis rackets for the\nWii or, going even further\nback, the GameBoy\nColour printer?! If you\nwant to collect games\nyou will also need the\nconsoles and peripherals\nto play that game \u2013 but\nbeyond that the choice is\nyours.\nThere are so many different consoles nowadays.\nIf you only include the\nbig three (XBOX, PlayStation, and Nintendo),\nand only include home\nconsoles, there are 14\nunique consoles you could\npurchase. Damn. Luckily,\nif you are already into\ngaming you likely have at\nleast one of these, so you\nalready know where to\nstart! You might as well\nstart by buying games for\na console you already own\n\u2013 then you don\u2019t have to\ndump a load of cash on an\nentirely new console.\nIf you are considering purchasing a new\nconsole, I have a few\nrecommendations. The\nPS3 is insanely cheap at\nthe moment, along with\nits game library. It has\nbeen officially dead for\na few years now, but the\nupcoming PS5 releasing\nin 2020 is rumoured to\nbe backwards compatible\nwith PS3 games. This will\nresult in a big price hike\nfor PS3 games when the\nPS5 releases, so now is\nthe time to start collect-ing! Another option is the\nNES (Nintendo Entertainment System), which was\nNintendo\u2019s first true home\nconsole (ignoring the col-our-tv game from the 70s).\nNES games are becoming\nsurprisingly affordable\nrecently, but are likely to\ngo up in price within a few\nyears as they become rarer\nand rarer. Additionally,\nthe homebrew scene for\nNES games is booming\nat the moment, with\nmany different types of\ngames easily available to\npurchase online. Together,\nthese two things mean it\u2019s\nthe perfect time to corner\nthe NES market.\nOnce we have decided\nwhat we are collecting\nfor, we then need to\nknow where we can find\nthem. There are many\noptions online. For new\ngames, you can simply\ngo to Amazon and order\nthem new, but there are\nalso plenty of options for\nolder games. The obvious\nchoice is eBay, a go-to\nsimply because it has\nsuch a huge variety of\ngames available, as well\nas having much more\nreliable sellers. Facebook\nmarketplace can be a\ngood resource too, and\nyou can often find people\nlisting bundles of games\nfor WAY cheaper than\nthey are worth as they\u2019re\nunaware of the true value.\nHowever, the issue\nwith purchasing online is\ntwofold. Firstly, it is very\neasy to sell fake games.\nAs the value of retro\ngames climbs, it attracts\ncon-artists \u2013 scammers\nare getting very good at\nproducing labels that look\nalmost identical to the true\nproducts. I have fallen\nprey to this before, purchasing Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\non eBay a couple of years\nback only to receive it in\na fake box with a fake\ncartridge. Secondly, purchasing older games that\nused cardboard boxes is\nrisky \u2013 if the seller does\nnot package it properly,\nthe box can get damaged\nin transit, meaning your\nnewly-purchased near-mint copy of Mega Man 2\ncould arrive as a crumpled\nmess. It hurts my heart to\neven type this.\nLuckily, purchasing\ngames in person is also an\noption. Granted, searching\nin-person does not offer\nthe same seemingly unlimited range and variety\nthat shopping online\nprovides, but the ability\nto check out the game\nand make sure it is legit\nand undamaged gives any\nbuyer better \u2018peace of\nmind\u2019.\nFor common games,\nespecially those after the\n5th generation (the PS1\nand N64 era), Computer\nExchange (CeX) is your\nbest friend. CeX is a chain\nof shops specialising in\nused video games and\nelectronics. There is\nbound to be one within\nwalking distance of you,\nwith as many copies of\nWii Sports as you could\never need. CeX has very\nfair prices, and they make\nsure all of their products\nare in working condition \u2013\nwith a warranty. The only\nissue with CeX is that\nthey are lacking in a) rare\ngames, and b) older, retro\ngames.\nFor most people, then,\nCeX is your best friend \u2013\nbut if you\u2019re like me and\nenjoy diving into the rich\nhistory of video games,\nyou\u2019ll want to know\nwhere to get the rare stuff.\nFor this, there are many\noptions. Charity shops\nare always a good shout.\nAlthough not commonly\nfound, sometimes you can\ncome across something\nrare for significantly\nless than it\u2019s worth. I\u2019m\ntalking Super Smash\nBros. Melee for \u00a31. This\nis because, for example,\nmany parents will simply\ngive away their children\u2019s\ngames when they move\nout of the house. Equally,\ncar boot sales are an\nexcellent choice. A few\nyears ago you could\nfind bucketfuls of rare\nAn old console ready to be collected // Pixabay\n\u201c... your newly-purchased\nnear-mint copy\nof Mega Man\n2 could arrive\nas a crumpled\nmess\u201d\n\u201cHowever,\nthe issue with\npurchasing\nonline is\ntwofold.\nFirstly, it is\nvery easy\nto sell fake\ngames\u201d\nFRIDAY, 29TH\nNOVEMBER, 2019 FELIX\n30\n\n"

A request was put in\nto College for suggestions\nfor which College staff\nmembers may be suitable.\nOut of the candidates, Joe\nCooper (formerly staff\nat the Union who then\nmoved to College HR)\nendorsed Jon. The Officer\nTrustees confirmed they\nwere happy with the selec-tion, though they will only\nbe officially meeting with\nJon in this capacity for the\nfirst time on Monday.\nThe College is already\nheavily involved with\nsupporting Union operations after the high\nstaff turnover has left\ngaps in service provi-sion. Examples include\nthe backlog of room\nWhen queried about\nwhether College\u2019s involvement would interfere\nwith the Union\u2019s remit of\nadvocating for students,\nwhich may require an\noppositional stance\nagainst College decisions,\nAbhijay said:\n\u201cWe welcome the\nsupport being offered by\nCollege. Of course we\nhave to be wary of areas\nwhere there might be conflicts of interest, but when\nit comes to Jon and the\nother staff members, my\nunderstanding is they're\nhere to help us fix some\nof the fundamentals (e.g.\nHealth and Safety). They\naren't here to set a new\nstrategic direction for the\nUnion or give input on\nwhat stance we take with\nCollege in a negotiation.\nTo be clear, Jon isn't the\nnew Jarlath; while we'll\nbe getting help for some\nof Jarlath's current day-to-day responsibilities, this\nisn't us appointing a new\nManaging Director.\u201d\nHowever, the email\ndistributed by Abhijay on\nbehalf of Jill Finney stated\nthat the working relationship will include long-term strategic advice:\n\u201cJon will also be working\nwith the President, the\nOfficer Trustees, the\nSenior management team\nand Board of Trustees to\nhelp us review our strategy and priorities both in\nthe short term and looking\nto the longer term.\u201d\nAs a result, what\nprecise role Jon Tucker\nand, as an extension, the\nCollege will play in the\nUnion\u2019s ongoing strategy\nand decision-making\nremains unclear and will\nreportedly be fleshed out\nin the coming week.\nManaging Director of the Union Steps Down\nThe most senior member of permanent Union staff, the Managing Director Jarlath O\u2019Hara, is stepping down from\nhis role before the start of next term\n\u201cThis is the\nfirst time\nCollege staff\nhave stepped\nin at the most\nsenior level\nof the Union,\nat which\ndecisions\nabout\ndirection are\nmade\u201d\n\u201cThis marks\nthe first\nmember of\nthe Senior\nManagement\nGroup to be\ncaught in the\nrecent wave of\nresignations\nfrom the\nUnion\u201d\nThe Union will say goodbye to one of its most senior members of staff in December // ICU\nbookings unanswered\nby the Activities team\n\u2013 who are currently left\nwith only a single staff\nmember \u2013 being taken\nover by College\u2019s Events\nand Conference team, and\nCollege Estates working\nwith the Commercial\nServices directorate to\naddress hygiene and electrical safety issues in the\nkitchen in 568.\nHowever, this represents the first time that\nCollege staff have stepped\nin at the most senior level,\nat which decisions regarding the overall direction\nand vision of the Union\nare made.\nproblem.

As temperatures\nrise, our relationship\nwith nature will have to\nbegrudgingly adjust. This\nadjustment will certainly\ninvolve the weathering\nof unprecedented natural\ndisasters \u2013 droughts,\nwildfires, pollution, food\nshortages and sinking\ncities. But, just as impor-tantly, our interaction with\nother living organisms\nwill also undergo a substantial transformation.\nWe all hear the same\nstories about wild animals\non the verge of extinction,\ndecliningnumbersofbees,\nforests being demolished\nto accommodate capitalist\ngreed and crop failure.\nLess widely known is\nwhat happens to bugs (or\nrather microorganisms) in\na climate crisis \u2013 so what\ngoes on?\nHumans and microbes\nhave co-evolved over\nhundreds of thousands of\nyears of a relatively steady\nclimate state. There are\nbacteria and viruses, such\nas the gut microbiome,\nthat we happily co-exist\nwith; and there are microorganisms that wreak\nhavoc on our bodies and\nimmune system, causing\ndangerous disease and\nsometimes death. Our\nrelationship with the latter\ntype of microorganisms\nis often described as an\narms race, with humans\noccasionally gaining the\nupper hand over a virus\nor a bacterium with the\nserendipitous discovery\nof a new drug or vaccine.\nHowever, with antibiotic\nresistance on the rise, and\nthe compounded effects\nof climate change, it looks\nlike we may be ceding\nour advantage. With\nglobal warming comes\nchange; both old and\nnew microorganisms can\nre-surface, re-locate or\neven re-evolve into more\ndangerous forms.\nMelting ice caps and\nin its duration, claimed\nmore lives than World\nWar I) in a mass grave in\nAlaska. Moreover, it is\nsuspected that smallpox\nand bubonic plague are\nburied in Siberia, raising\nthe frightening possibility\nthat these 18th\nand 19th\ncentury diseases, once\nthought to be extinct, can\nre-surface and re-infect\nthe human species.\nIn a stable climate, the\nendemic zones of certain\nmicroorganism-spread\ndiseases are geographically well demarcated. Vector-borne viruses, such\nas dengue, yellow fever\nand zika, are restricted to\ntropical areas where their\nmosquito carriers thrive\n- but as temperatures rise\nand the tropics expand,\nthese can rapidly conquer\nnew territories. Indeed,\nyellow fever, originally\nrestricted to the Amazon\nbasin, has now spread\nthrough the rainforest\nand reached Brazil\u2019s two\nlargest cities, S\u00e3o Paulo\nand Rio de Janeiro, with\na 34% case-fatality rate.\nMosquitoes spreading\nzika and dengue are also\non the move, with current\nmodels forecasting that\nby 2050 nearly half of the\nworld\u2019s population will be\nat risk of one of these two\nperilous infections.\nCurrent research is\nalready focused on investigating microorganisms\nthat may resurface using\nDNA analysis to evaluate\ntheir infectious capabilities and antibiotic suscep-tibilities. Vaccines against\nmosquito-borne diseases\nare in the pipeline, with\nnew promising candidates\nemerging every year. In\nthis arms race, we appear\nto be one step ahead. But\nwe cannot forget about\nour bodies, which also\ncontain trillions of microorganisms \u2013 on our skin,\nin the mouth, lungs and\nthe gut, all of which are\ncrucial to our health. At\nthe present moment, we\nhave evolved a mutually\nbeneficial relationship\nwith these, forming a\nsymbiotic microbiome.\nBut as the climate\nchanges, this relationship\ncan reinvent itself in unpredictable ways.\nIn 2015, nearly two-thirds of the global\npopulation of the saiga\nantelope died within just\na couple of days, over\na large region in central\nKazakhstan. The cause\nof this mass extinction\nevent was revealed to be\na bacterial infection - the\nbacteria Pasteurella multocida typically lives in\nthe saiga\u2019s tonsils without\ncausing any harm, but the\nunprecedented humidity\nlevels and elevated\nsummer temperatures led\nto the bacteria\u2019s rapid proliferation and its invasion\nof the bloodstream and\nvital organs, killing the\nantelopes. As Ed Yong\nwrote in The Atlantic:\n\u201cClimate is the trigger.\nPasteurella is the bullet.\u201d\nAs the planet is\nslowly warming up, we\nare leaving behind the\nenvironment that supported our evolution and\nsurvival; the environment\nthat has maintained the\nprecarious status quo\nbetween us and microbes.\nWith rising temperatures\ncome new evolutionary\npressures, and microorganisms are notoriously\nbetter at adapting than us.\nSo who will win?\nThe Saiga antelope; two thirds of the global population died from a disease altered by climate change // Yakov\nFedorov\n\u201cWith antibiotic\nresistance on\nthe rise, and the\ncompounded\neffects of climate\nchange, it looks\nlike we may\nbe ceding our\nadvantage\u201d\npermafrost soil, apart\nfrom releasing greenhouse\ngases into the atmosphere\nand steadily raising the\nsea levels, also represent\nfrozen layers of infectious\nhistory.

I\u2019m\nstill traumatised by their\nequivalent of Sean Bean,\nLeomon, who seemingly\ncould not go an episode\nwithout falling.\nSo you can imagine\nthat for me, it was a very\npleasant surprise when I\nheard that Digimon Story:\nCyber Sleuth and the\nfollow-up game Hacker\u2019s\nMemories were coming to\nthe Switch in a combined\npackage. Fortunately, I\nmanaged to get a press\ncopy courtesy of Namco\nBandai \u2013 which is timely,\ngiven that it\u2019s the same\nweek as Cyber Monday.\nI had previously played\nHacker\u2019s Memories on the\nPS4, and can say that it has\ncarried over beautifully to\nthe Switch in numerous\nways.\nFirst things first, the\nbiggest positive: my\nfavourite thing about this\nport is the ability to play\nthe game portably without\nsacrificing graphical\nquality. It is an absolute\nwonder, especially given\nthe game\u2019s long completion time. Previously, I\nfelt unable to fully invest\nthe time needed to finish\noff the PS4 version \u2013\nwhich doesn\u2019t apply now\nthat I have the chance to\ntake it on the road. There\nare occasional framerate\ndrops when the Switch is\nundocked, but this minor\nsetback is fully worth the\nflexibility and graphic\nfidelity.\nThe game itself\nrevolves around the havoc\nthat is being unleashed in\nthe digital world known as\nEDEN. Our protagonists\nin each game \u2013 highly\ncolourful in Cyber Sleuth\nand deliberately bland\nin Hacker\u2019s memories\n\u2013 attempt to unfurl the\nmysteries behind various\nunexplained hackings,\nalong with strange\n\u201cAt the last\nComic-con I\nmanaged to\nsnag almost\nevery Spyro\ngame from a\nsingle seller\u201d\nphysical phenomena, as\nthe digital world seems\nto be leaking into the real\nworld. We follow the protagonists as they endeavour to discover the cause.\nIn Cyber Sleuth you are\npart of a detective agency\nworking to figure out\nwhat\u2019s going on, whilst\nin Hacker\u2019s Memory you\nplay as a member of a\ngroup of hackers.\nIn terms of mechanics,\nthe battle system utilises\na classic \u2018rock-paper-scissors\u2019 style effectiveness\nsystem \u2013 vaccine is effective against virus, virus is\neffective against data, and\nso on \u2013 with an additional\nlayer of \u2018typing\u2019 such as\nDark, Light, Earth, or\nElectric. These familiar\nmechanics are combined\nwith attack cut scenes that\nare visually gorgeous \u2013 especially as you get a kick\nof nostalgia from seeing\nyour favourite Digimon\nfrom childhood rendered\nin fantastic 3D detail. The\n\u2018digivolving\u2019 system has\na magnificent amount of\ndepth that encourages\nthe player to evolve and\ndevolve numerous times\nin order to get the strongest Digimon possible.\nAll the while, you are\nalso encountering and\nusing your favourite companions throughout the\nadventure \u2013 a particular\nfavourite of mine being\nDiaboromon (the one that\nwas featured in Digimon\nThe Movie and almost\nnuked a country!)\nI strongly enjoyed the\ngame\u2019s music, but its implementation has flaws \u2013 a\nnotable downside is that\nsome overused tracks can\nget a bit repetitive at times,\nsuch as the standard battle\ntheme. However, that\u2019s\nbalanced by the outside\nbattle music, which is\nrefreshing and alternating\nas you continue through\nthe game.\nAll in all, the port is\ngreat and I highly recommend it. Despite a few\nminor downsides, such as\nthe framerate drops and\na few repetitive tracks,\nthe game encompasses a\nsense of reliving of child-hood, and delving further\ninto the digital world.\nThe absolute madman, Diaboromon // Wikimedia\npickups. Recently people\nare becoming a lot more\nsavvy about the worth of\ntheir old games, and it is\nbecoming increasingly\ndifficult to find bargains\nat a market or car boot\nsale, but you can still get\nlucky. If you are looking\nfor insane deals, stick to\ncharity shops or eBay and\nhope that fortune strikes.\nBut if you just want to\nfind something specific,\nthat rare gem you\u2019ve\nspent years searching for,\nI recommend going to a\nconvention! Retro gaming\nconventions are great,\nbut not that common.\nYou will, however, find\nsome relevant stalls in any\ngaming convention you\ngo to. Insomnia, the UK\u2019s\nbiggest gaming conven-tion, and Comic-con are\nmy personal favourites.\nYou\u2019ll find lots of people\nselling literal crates of\nold games \u2013 at the last\nComic-con I managed\nto snag almost every\nSpyro game from a single\nseller (keep your eye out\nfor an upcoming article\nabout them here in Felix\nGames!) Also, conventions are quite possibly\nthe best environment to\nbe in for an avid game\ncollector. You\u2019ll meet\nmany like-minded people\nthat you can spark a conversation with, and maybe\neven make some friends\nyou can trade with in the\nfuture.\nHopefully you have\na better idea of how to\nget started on your game\ncollecting journey! Last\npoints: make sure you\nknow what your collecting for! If it\u2019s retro games,\nthen buy in-person and\nideally from a convention\n\u201c... you get\na kick of\nnostalgia\nfrom seeing\nyour favourite\nDigimon...\u201d\nor a charity shop. If it\u2019s\nnewer titles, then buying\nonline or in a CeX shop\nis your best option. Just\nremember to have fun\nwith it, and don\u2019t go overboard \u2013 or you\u2019ll never\nget through that dreaded\nbacklog.\nGames Writer Conor Winzar relives his youth with a nostalgic dose of Digimon, new to the Switch.\n\n"

The Chinese\nplan to topple American\ndominance of Middle East\nhas two main parts.\nThe \ufb01rst is seen in the\ninvestment strategy China\ncommonly uses to create\neconomic interdepend-ence, through schemes\nsuch as the Belt and\nRoad Initiative, to give\nthemselves leverage over\nother nations.

The United States\nhas reduced the number of\ntroops in nearly all parts\nof the region \u2013 with an\nexception to SaudiArabia,\nwho it has pledged to\nprotect.\nMoreover, the United\nStates has tried to reduce\nits dependence on foreign\noil. In 2007, it imported\n12 billion barrels of oil\nper day, whereas in 2017 it\nimported 2 billion barrels\nof foreign oil per day.\nRecently it became a net\noil exporter, competing\nwith the Middle Eastern\noil giants.\nThe US increasingly\nviews the Middle East as a\nstrategic defence location,\nand China is attempting to\n\ufb01ll in America\u2019s position\nas the dominant power\nin the Middle East for 2\nreasons; to secure its oil\nsources and for strategic\npurposes for shipping.\nThe port of Duqm is also\ncurrently receiving US\nand Indian investment.\nMoreover, having a port\nin Duqm and a trade\nroute into the Middle East\ncan potentially reduce\nChinese dependence on\nshipping in the Indian\nOcean, in which China\u2019s\naccess can be blocked by\nthe USA and India, the\ntwo main naval powers\nin the Indian Ocean.\nIncreased in\ufb02uence in\nthe global oil trade would\nempower Beijing and give\nit leverage over rivals\nsuch as India \u2013 a country\nwhich is currently seeing\nfaster economic growth\nthan China \u2013 who also\ndepend on oil imports.\nIn conclusion, if more\ncountries switch to the\nPetroyuan system, the\nin\ufb02uence and global\ndominance of the United\nStates of America will\ngreatly decrease while\nChinese soft power would\ngrow. This would impact\neveryone in the world in\nnearly all aspects of life;\nfrom international laws\nand regulation, to leverage\non freedom of speech and\nmedia freedoms. The\nendgame on who becomes\nthe dominant power of\nthe 21st century may be\ndependent on decisions\nby OPEC on whether to\ncease or continue trading\noil in dollars. For better\nor worse, the world as we\nknow it will change.\ninfrastructure, business\npartnerships and the sale\nof military technology.\nIn Middle East, the\nChinese government-con-trolled SINOPEC and\noil behemoth Saudi\nARAMCO has a joint\nventure to build a $10\nbillion oil re\ufb01nery, and\na similar re\ufb01nery is also\nbeing built in cooperation\nwith the Government of\nKuwait. However, the\nlargest Chinese investment is in Oman. The city\nof Duqm, only a decade\nago it was a small \ufb01shing\ntown with a population\nwith 5,100. However, it\nis expected to grow to\n100,000 by 2020 due to\nincreasing foreign investment by China, USA and\nIndia. The Chinese will\ncreate infrastructure such\nas highways, buildings\nand build a port in the\narea, which will significantly bene\ufb01t Oman\u2019s\neconomy. However, it is\nof greater bene\ufb01t to China\nas it provides a location\nwhich avoids the Strait of\nHormuz, which is an increasingly unstable body\nof water due to Iranian\nseizures of oil tankers.\nSecondly, in addition\nto creating links with the\nMiddle East, China is\nattempting to create an\noil trading the Petroyuan,\nto compete with and\ntopple the Petrodollar.\nTrump:\u201cDoes the USA want to\nbe the Policeman of the Middle\nEast getting NOTHING but\nspending precious lives and\ntrillions of dollars protecting\nothers who, in almost all cases,\ndo not appreciate what we are\ndoing?

Nonetheless, the Chinese government is trying to tempt\nmore countries into using\nthis alternative system\nby making the Petroyuan\na gold backed currency,\nwith options to fully\nexchange Petroyuan to\ngold in both the Shanghai\nand Hong Kong exchang-es. Additionally, countries\nfacing US sanctions can\navoid them by switching\nto the Petroyuan. So far,\n4 countries have started\nto use this system; Iran,\nRussia, Venezuela and\nAngola, all countries that\nhave been sanctioned for\nreasons political reasons\nand human rights abuses.\nThis escape from US\nsanctions and being a gold\nbacked form of currency\nare very attractive to\nmany countries.

The government\nhas reacted viciously to\nthe protests \u2013 even by the\nstandards of the Middle\nEast. Security forces have\n\ufb01red rubber bullets, live\nammunition, and tear gas\nat the raging crowd who\nwere armed with nothing\nbut the Iraqi \ufb02ag. Snipers\nwere deployed atop tall\nbuildings to threaten and\nfrighten the protestors.\nThe insurgents\noccupied all \ufb02oors of an\nempty, six-story Turkish\nrestaurant standing\nopposite to Tahrir Square.\nBoth the building and\nTahrir Square have\nbecome the symbols and\nfortresses of this protest.\nTheir main demands\nwere for snipers to be\nwithdrawn, the political\ncabinet to be restructured,\nand unemployment and\ncorruption to be fought. In\nresponse, the government\nthreatened to dismiss any\ngovernmental employee\nwho participated in the\nprotests and issued a city-wide curfew. This only\nled the protests to grow,\nand on October 25th, the\nriots spread to other provinces of the country, this\ntime the demand was the\nabolishment of the entire\npolitical system.\nThe rage of the demonstrators has been directed\nat high unemployment\nlevels and the practice of\nassigning governmental\nposts based on partisan\nloyalties and ethnic\naf\ufb01liations rather than\ncredentials and quali\ufb01cations. The ruling elite\nare accused of misusing\nfunds, poorly managing\nstate resources, and\nfailing to meet even the\nmost basic needs of the\nIraqi people \u2013 jobs and\nbasic public services.\nOutrage is also directed\nat the political system\nenforced upon them by\nthe Americans following\nthe 2003 invasion and\noverthrowal of dictator\nSaddam Hussein. Since\nthe downfall of Hussein,\nthe in\ufb02uence of religious\n\ufb01gures and politicians\nfrom the neighbouring\ncountry Iran have grown\nmarkedly in Iraq. Iranian-backed militias roam\naround the country, like\nma\ufb01a-esque extortion\ngroups, causing unrelenting anxiety for Iraqi\ncitizens. Furthermore,\nHundreds of young men\nfrom cities like Basra and\nNasiriyah lost their lives\n\ufb01ghting ISIS.\nBut once ISIS was\ndefeated, the contradictions came to light. Many\nyoung men returning from\nthe war were shocked to\nrealisehowgreatthesocial\ninjustice among the Shia\u2019\nwas. When a government\ndelegation visited Nasiriyah, the demonstrators\ncomplained that little had\nchanged for the people\nsince Saddam. At that\ntime, the Shia\u2019 of Nasiriyah had been suppressed,\ntoday they suffered again\nhardship, while the party\nelites enjoyed all the\nbene\ufb01ts of gaining power\nand the victory of terror.\nThe young people\ncan no longer be put off\nwith solemn religious\nwords previously used\nby the government to\nrule the country. This\nwas the case in 2006 and\n2014, which both led to\ninfamous civil wars that\nended in bloodshed. One\nof the \ufb01rst slogans of the\nDemonstrations in central Bagdhad // Ziyad Matti\n\u201cBaghdad will\nbe free\u201d\nmany Iraqi politicians\nand militias have become\nloyal to Iran, submitting\nthe country\u2019s government\nto Iran\u2019s bidding, whilst\nIraqis, despite the country\u2019s vast oil reserves,\nhave neither medical care,\nsafety, nor good educa-tion.\nThe Iraqi people\u2019s\nanger at Iran\u2019s increasing\nauthority is understand-able, though corruption\nin Iraq cannot be solely\nblamed on the Tehran\nregime. This protest is\nlarger than that \u2013 it represents a \ufb01ght by the restless\nmasses of a younger generation of Iraqis who are\ntired; having witnessed\ncountless wars, from the\n2003 invasion, to the civil\nwar in 2006 and ISIS in\n2014. They are struggling\nto scratch out a living and\nare entirely rejecting their\ncorrupt government.\nThis is an unprecedented situation for the Iraqi\ngovernment. Because\ncompared to previous\ncon\ufb02icts in Iraq, now it\nis largely Shia\u2019s who are\nfacing each other. Anyone\nwho thinks of clashes in\nIraq solely a result of a\ncon\ufb02ict between Sunnis\nand Shia\u2019s may \ufb01nd that\nstrange.\nAnd it is not the \ufb01rst\ntime that Shia\u2019s have\nclashed with Shia\u2019s.\nSaddam Hussain was at\nan 8-year long war with\nShi\u2019ite Iran, but two-thirds\nof his army consisted of\nShia\u2019s \u2013 peasants, poor\nIraqisfromthesouth,afew\nKurds \u2013 while the senior\nof\ufb01cers and generals were\nmostly Sunnis. When the\nShia\u2019 majority in Iraq\ncame to power following the fall of Saddam,\nthe Shia\u2019 south was the\ngovernment\u2019s mainstay.\nuprising was \u201cThe thieves\nrobbed us in the name of\nreligion\u201d. This is re\ufb02ected\nby the presence of Shia\u2019s,\nSunnis, Christians and\nYezidis on the streets of\nBaghdad today; united\nin their hatred towards\nthe government and the\nearnest feeling that they\nsee no future in their\ncountry. And for that they\n\u201cThis protest\nrespresents\na fight by the\nrestless masses\nof a younger\ngeneration of\nIraqis who are\ntired\u201d\nFollowing almost two decades of war, inequality and corruption, Iraqi youth are taking to the streets to voice their\nanger.\nA protestor in Bagdhad wearing protective gear //\nAmeer Hazim\nblame the corrupt state\napparatus in Iraq.\nThe protest has reached\nits 32nd day.

The sweating,\nthe entranced dancing,\nthe rapture when the crescendo lifts your feet off\nthe ground. He brought\nall of that to Night Tales,\nwhose venue in Hackney\nhas been operating since\nthe summer of 2018 and\noffers entertainment quite\nuncharacteristic of the\ncapital, on Friday, the 22nd\nof November.\nDoing an all-night set\nis very brave, and for\nmany DJs it doesn\u2019t work\nout. I\u2019ve seen many big\nones fail to deliver the\nkind of performance that\nmakes you stay until the\nend - even those who are\nspectacular in a more\ncondensed 2-hour format.\nThat wasn\u2019t the case for\nDominik. The young BoJo\nlookalike slowly ramped\nup the pressure, and it\nis as much down to his\nincredibly astute sense for\nmixing as it is due to his\nincredibly poignant and\npunchy discography that\nthe set just kept getting\nbetter. The bed-like seats\nin the venue\u2019s garden were\nalso the perfect pitstop,\nhelping keep legs fresh.\nThe atmosphere, which\nwas the only thing preventing this from being\na perfect set, was at first\ndiluted by the abundant\nday-trippers and Hackney-hipster socialites.\nBut slowly, in the front\nleft corner, there seemed\nto be building an enclave\nof those who were there\nto tear up the dancefloor.\nThere was the head-to-toe\ntattooed guy with hair\ndown to his waist giving\nit his double-jointed all,\ntwisting to the melodies\nlike a venomous snake, his\nshirt long since on the floor\nnext to him. There were his\nfriends, ideal blackbodies\nin their Docs and leather,\nvibrating all around him\nlike bey-blades. The few\nwords that were exchanged\nwere all in German. We\ndidn\u2019t need to speak. This\nwas little Berlin in the\nheart of East London.\nWhen Dominik talks\nabout music, he talks about\nsea snails, about birds,\nand about the rustling\nof the leaves. These are\nsounds he regularly uses\nin his compositions,\nrounding them out with\nhis beastly modular synths\nand perfectly symmetric\nclicky beats. His agenda\nis as much to make people\ndance as it is to spread\nawareness of environmental conservation. He might\nresemble the Tory leader\nbut in politics he could not\nbe further removed from\nhim.\n\u201cWhen we see or hear a\nrare bird sing, we all giggle\nlike little children,\u201d he says\nof his everyday life in a\nlittle town between Frankfurt and Cologne. From\nthis heart of nature, in a\nhouse overlooking a lake,\nnext to a bird reserve, he\nmakes his music. \u201cNature\nis the world\u2019s greatest\nartist,\u201d he explains. I\nam inclined to agree. If\nyou\u2019re passionate about\nboth nature and techno, I\nsense that his music will\nmake you feel things that\nno other music can. His\ndeftness of touch, and the\nelegance of his melodies\nare unparalleled. His bass\nALWAYS bites hard. You\nmight be in the middle of a\nforest, dazzling colours all\naround, and then a storm\ncomes. He flicks it around\nlike that.\nAs an intro to the man,\nI recommend checking out\nhis Cercle set on Youtube\nor his bird-themed website.\nYou won\u2019t be sorry.\nStarcrawlercomfortably blows minds at Camden show\nA\nh, Underworld.\nSo many\ni n c o m p l e t e\nmemories of\ntoo many nights out. So\nmany vivid memories of\nstrange men standing just\na bit too close when you\u2019re\njust trying to have a night\nout with friends. Despite\nmy current opinion of\nUnderworld, it will always\nhold a special place in my\nwannabe-Camden-rocker\nheart. So much so when\nI saw Starcrawler were\nplaying I knew I had to go, if\nonly to see what a gig night\nwas like there. Walking in,\nmy sober self unjustifiably\nfelt the same thrill getting\npast security as I normally\ndo when they fail to notice\nI\u2019m completely inebriated.\nThe support, Pretty Sick,\nwere drawling out some\ndoom-inspired punk songs,\nwith singer Sabrina Fuentes\nrasping over them in her\nNew York twang. They\nwere actually pretty sick,\nseemingly holding some\ngood core grunge principles\nto heart while incorporating\nan indie twist in their guitar\nline. The anticipation grew\nafter Pretty Sick finished, a\nrising hubbub in the air as the\ncrowd mentally, physically\nand emotionally prepared for\nthe incoming onslaught. \t\t\nEventually, with\nanticipation at a high, the\nheadliner appeared, one by\none as first drums then bass,\nguitar and finally vocals\nbuilt up to their first song\n\u2018Home Alone\u2019. Starcrawler\nthen kicked into one of\ntheir first releases, \u2018Used\nto Know\u2019, off their first EP\nwhich went on to garner\nthem plenty of attention. The\nriff-driven, catchy tune soon\nhad a pit going while singer\nArrow de Wilde (real name)\nliterally pranced about\nabove us, stretching and\nrolling across the stage. A\nfew songs later and guitarist\nHenri Cash\u2019s cheesy grins\nemanated across the room as\nhe strutted his stuff wearing\na white cowboy suit covered\nin glittery roses and ants.\nThis was a nod to their other\nfirst song \u2018Ants\u2019 which they\nthen rushed into, de Wilde\ncapturing our attention\nwhile performing as she first\nstrangled herself with the\nmic cable before making obscene gestures with the mic\nitself. However, the majority\nof the songs throughout the\nset seemed to be lacking,\ndespite the energy from the\nband and crowd. Their punk\nenergy and style didn\u2019t quite\nmatch up with the music,\nwith lots of their similar\npop-punk tracks making the\nset feel bunched into one\nunenthusiastic song. This\nwas evident with songs like\n\u2018Hollywood Ending\u2019 and\n\u2018Tank Top\u2019, although notable\nsongs that came across\nincredibly well live included\n\u2018Lizzy\u2019, \u2018She Gets Around\u2019\nand the Marc Bolan-inspired\nriffage in \u2018Pussy Tower\u2019.\nStarcrawler even treated us\nto a rendition of their cover of\nRamones\u2019 \u2018Pet Sematary\u2019, as\nfeatured in the credits of the\nlatest remake of the Stephen\nKing classic. Finishing up\nthe set, \u2018Train\u2019 built up the\nenergy again to throw the\ncrowd into a frenzy, before\nnew hit \u2018Bet My Brains\u2019\nclosed up the show. Overall,\nI left not feeling bowled\nover, but I definitely hadn\u2019t\nwasted my time creeping\nback to Underworld again.\nYou don\u2019t even know about the cheeky fag under I\u2019m\nlighting under the decks // Wikimedia\nMUSIC\nFELIX ISSUE 1736\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMUSIC\nEmily Freeman\nMusic Editor\nVenue: The Underworld.\nDate: 21/11/2019.

    "content": "Hyde Park Winter\nWonderland Comedy Club\nThe Tiger Will See You\nNow\nB\ne t w e e n\nNovember and\nDecember of\nevery year,\nWinter Wonderland opens\nits doors to Londoners\nand tourists alike as one\nof the most visited attrac-tions. It has the perfect\natmosphere for just going\naround the Christmas\nmarkets and enjoying the\nrides (of course while\ndrinking mulled wine) but\ndid you know that there\nare Comedy Club shows\nthere?\nShows start at 9pm\nand are 45 minutes long.\nThey take place from\nThursdays to Saturdays\nfrom 21st November until\n21st December, with a different comic lineup every\nweek.\nFor my visit, the lineup\nconsisted of Emmanuel\nSonubi as the host, while\nThomas Green and\nMarcus Brigstocke were\nthe opening and the headlining acts respectively.\nSonubi was the\nfunniest by far, thanks\nto his excellent engagement with the audience.\nHis show focused on\nsatirical comments on\nmodern \u2018language\u2019 and\nhow certain words have\nbecome forbidden over\nthe past decades.\nGreen, the pan Australian comedian based in the\nUK, started by making\nsome friendly jokes that\ncompared the UK to\nAustralia. Then, he moved\non to tell funny, albeit pre-dictable, stories and jokes\nfocusing on problems\nwithin a relationship.\nBrigstocke, the star\nof the night, started by\nbonding with the audience\nby asking different\npeople\u2019s nationalities\nand made hilarious and\nentertaining jokes for\neach country mentioned.\nThis was really great\nfun. He then talked about\nthe \u2018division\u2019 between\npeople in support and\nin opposition of Brexit,\nespecially within his own\nfamily. Unfortunately,\nhe could not keep the\nmomentum going, and\ndid not finish as well as\nhe started, ending his set\nwith cliched jokes about\nmarital relationships.\nGenerally, all the performers were funny but\nrather forgettable and pre-dictable. It left me feeling\nthat the event was targeted\nmore towards tourists and\ncasual Winter Wonderland\nvisitors rather than regular\ncomedy club goers, which\nled to the quality of\ncomedy suffering. Acts\nrefused to show person-ality, instead opting for\ncliche jokes dealing with\nracism, politics, sexism\nand relationship problems.\nThe attendees seemed\nto enjoy themselves but\nthe price, fixed at \u00a315 plus\ntransaction fees, is too\nhigh for a 45-minute-long\ncomedy performance.\nNevertheless, the rest\nof this year\u2019s lineup looks\npromising with plenty of\ntalented comedians set to\nperform. If you end up at\nWinter Wonderland one\nof these coming weeks\nand want to experience\nsomething other than the\nsame old attractions, I\nsuggest you check out\nthe lineup for that day,\non Winter Wonderland\u2019s\nofficial website. Despite\nthe price tag, you might be\nin for a very entertaining\n45 minutes.\nI\nlive with medics, and\nfrom the way they\ngo on, one could be\nforgiven for thinking\nthat the last thing that any\nof them want is to be a\ndoctor. Which is why it\nis so funny that the ICSM\nmedics chose to put on\nTiger Country last week\nas their autumn play. This\nis a play based on the assumption that given how\ndifficult it is to become\na doctor, the only people\nwilling to give it a go are\nthe horrible, the neurotic\nor the uncaring. I bet rehearsals were a real laugh.\n\u201cRight guys, let\u2019s just\nrerun the patient dying\nfrom sepsis contracted as\na result of a surgical error\nand the underfunded heart\nattack unit scenes and\nthen we can go home and\ndo some anatomy!\u201d\nThankfully the medics\ntook to their roles with\nrelish. This was what they\nhad been training for, in\nsome cases for 6 years\nand boy, were they going\nto show it. Patients were\nlifted around by burly and\nnot so burly paramedics,\nacronyms like OSAor F28\nwere thrown around willy\nnilly and the cast seemed\nto be having a genuinely\ngood time.\nAstandout performance\nfrom lead actress Vashti\n(Eri Aung) who drew all\neyes to her whenever she\nwas on stage. Playing the\nrole of the highly competent but difficult surgeon\nshe came across as 8\nfeet tall despite probably\nbarely scraping 5 foot.\nHer despair as she is\nforced to choose between\nthe health of a relative\nand her own career were\ngenuinely touching and\nhard to watch.\nThe other notable performance for me was Mr\nMercer the cancer sufferer\n(Ehsaan Zaman) while not\npresent for long (thoughts\nand prayers), his noble\nresignation was sensitive\nand mature.\nWhile lacking energy\nat points from certain\nmembers of the ensemble,\nthe strength of the plot\nand the leads drives the\nstory onwards to its sad\nand cold conclusion.\nTiger country isn\u2019t so\nmuch about doctors as it\nis doctor adjacent. It is\nabout people who have\nbeen expected to care\nabout others for so long\nand with such intensity\nthat many of them crack,\nsinking into despair and\nnihilism. The cast has a lot\nto look forward to.\nOne final point: if\nyou were in the light\nbox on Thursday night\nyou should be ashamed\nof yourself. The whole\naudience could hear you\ntalking and laughing. You\nlet yourself and the actors\nwho had worked so hard\ndown.\nHopefully not coming to an A&E near you // ICSM Drama\nA very entertaining evening indeed // Piet Hein\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 29TH\nNOVEMBER, 2019\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nCalum Drysdale\nArts Writer\nWhere?

    "content": "Imperial Triathlon triumph at BUCS Duathlon\nSPORTS\nDavid Ho\nIC Tri Captain\nS\nunday 24th\nNovember was\none of those days\nwhere the world\nseemed to be set against\nthe Imperial College\ntriathlon team as they\nprepared for their first\nBritish Universities cham-pionships: in duathlon,\na multisport event comprised of a run, followed\nby a cycle, then another\nrun to finish.\nThe difficulties began\nbefore race day, when a\nseries of transport disasters occurred: a series of\nunfortunate events (or in\nless euphamistic terms,\na colossal cock-up from\nsomeone who should\nknow a lot better) resulted\nin a conspicuous lack of a\nminibus to transport the\nmajority of our compet-itors. A stress-filled and\nhectic day of contingency\nplanning took place, and\neventually the pumpkin\nof a situation became the\nbeautiful carriage that is\nGreat Western Railway.\nTransport trials and\ntribulations overcome,\nour athletes gathered in\nthe waiting area by Castle\nCombe racetrack, the air\nfilled with anticipation\nand moisture. But the\ntroubles were not yet\nover: just as the first wave\nwas lining up to begin,\nthe race was \u201cpostponed\nindefinitely\u201d following a\nserious medical incident\nin a non-BUCS race pre-viously. The competitors\nre-donned their layers and\nwaited for news. After\ndeliberation from the\norganisers, it was decided\nthat the race would be\nshortened to a two-mile\nrun, six-mile bike,\ntwo-mile run.\nAfter a very quick\nsecond warmup, the\nmen\u2019s elite wave were\noff. New recruit Leo Maisonobe was out first for\nIC, completing the first\ntwo miles in a scorching\n10 minutes 17 seconds.\nJust seconds behind\nwere Matt Ryan and Tom\nButler, the latter of whom\nwas very pleased that the\nshortened course favoured\nthe strongest runners. On\nto the bike leg, where\nLeo kept on moving up\nthe pack. Matt Ryan and\nAlex Wilson also put in\nstunning cycling perfor-mances, both well over 40\nkilometres per hour. After\nbattling through a painful\nfinal leg Leo Maisonobe\nremained best-placed with\nan incredible 22nd place\nout of over 300 compet-itors, including many\ninternational athletes.\nNext to go were the\nelite women: at the front\nof the Imperial crew were\nMinty Martin and Marion\nthem. Minty pulled ahead\non the bike leg despite\nMarion\u2019s well-rehearsed\ntransitions, and narrowly\nheld on through the final\nrun to give her a fantastic 73rd place, the best\nfemale athlete from the\nclub. Special mentions\nalso to Remi Simpson,\nwho finished her debut\nduathlon in style, pacing\nperfectly to finish well\nbelow the 50th percentile\nat national university\nlevel.\nFinishing off the day\nwere Noah Sprent and\nHarshil Joshi representing\nin the mixed wave. Noah\ndemonstrated perfectly\nthat consistent training\npays off, with a bike leg\nthat wouldn\u2019t have been\nout of place in the elite\ncompetition. Harshil was\nplagued by a mechanical\nissue on the bike course,\nbut kept his cool to round\nout Imperial\u2019s day with\nanother solid perfor-mance, crossing the finish\nline to cheers from his\nsupporting teammates.\nIn an exemplary\ndisplay of grit and deter-mination, the TriIC team\nproudly returned, looking\nforward to the relaxation and rewards of the\nfestive season to come.\nSpecial thanks to our\ndrivers Emma Claxton,\nHarshil Joshi and Alex\nLuisi, without whom the\nday would not have been\npossible.\nImperial Triathlon excel at BUCS Duathlon after an equally adventurous journey to their race\nIC Triathlon Squad // Alex Luisi\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 29TH\nNOVEMBER, 2019\nSPORTS sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n56\n\u201cMatt Ryan\nand Alex\nWilson also put\nin stunning\ncycling\nperformances,\nboth well over\n40 kilometers\nper hour\u201d\nArtigaut, neck-and-neck\nout of the first run with\n0.2 seconds between\n\n"

Particularly,\nthey notify their customers about the details of a\ntransaction immediately\nafter it has been complet-ed. They also generate\nmonthly expenses reports\nand forecasts about future\nspending. One of the\nmost important features is\nthe ability to set savings\ngoals, which has now\nbeen replicated in the\nmobile applications of\ntheir established com-petitors. A large number\nof customers also appreciate the bill-splitting\nfeature which has proven\nuseful in several social\ncontexts. In terms of\ncurrency exchange fees,\nthey differ significantly\nfrom their conventional\nrivals as they tend not to\ncharge commission for\ntransactions abroad. This\ndecision renders them significantly more attractive\nfor customers wishing\nto spend money outside\nof their home country\nwithout incurring fees\nfrom mainstream banks.\nFinally, certain challenger\nbanks allow their users\naccess to cryptocurrency\ntrading.\nWhat about security?\nThe sign-up process\nfor these banks is just\nas rigorous as that of\nestablished institutions.\nUpon creating an account,\nusers are asked to submit\na digital copy of their\npassport or national\nidentity card as proof\nof identity and provide\nseveral identifying details,\nsuch as their address,\namongst others. As far\nas accessing an existing\naccount is concerned,\nthese newly created financial institutions offer the\nhighest safety standards\npossible. Their authentication methods include\nfingerprint scanning\nalong and facial and voice\nrecognition alongside the\nregular PIN code. In the\nevent that a card has been\nlost or stolen, customers\ncan login to their account\nto immediately freeze it.\nNeedless to say, the card\ncan be unfrozen in the\nexact same manner, if it\nis recovered. Perhaps the\nmost important concern\npotential customers will\nhave is: Can they trust\nthese banks with their\nsavings? These institutions are regulated by\nthe Financial Services\nAuthority (FCA) and the\nmajority of them covered\nby the Financial Services\nCompensation Scheme\n(FSCS), which guarantees\ndeposits up to \u00a385,000.\nThose wishing to create a\nnew account should definitely check whether the\nprovider they are interested in has gained regulatory approval and access to\nthe FSCS.

However, the\nway they have started\ntheir businesses has been\ndifferent as they have\nsought to target their applications towards specific\naudiences. On one hand,\nthere are those which\nshine in international\nmoney transfers. They\ncan be used in hundreds\nof different currencies\nand at a significantly\nreduced cost compared to\nhigh-street banks. Revolut\nhas been one of the most\nprominent in this area. It\ncharges no extra fees for\nglobal money transfers\nand spending abroad and\nalso uses the Interbank\nExchange Rate, which\nhelps save consumers\neven more. The Interbank\nExchange Rate is the rate\nused by two banks to\ntransfer capital between\nthemselves. Banks tend\nto charge a fee on top of\nthe rate used to make the\nexchange, a trend that\nRevolut has decided not to\nembrace for transactions\nbetween Monday and\nFriday, when the currency\nmarkets are open. On\nthe other hand, there\nalso exist those focused\non a more conventional\nbanking experience, such\nas Starling. This kind\nof upstart institutions\noffer a current account\nand usually, though not\nalways, pay interest on\ntheir customers\u2019 balance.\nThe list of services available typically includes\noverdraft; challenger\nbanks clearly state what\nfees they will charge\nfor using their overdraft\nfeature. In March 2017,\nStarling launched the\nUK\u2019s first app-based\ncurrent account.

By\nbuying into this ETF, you\nexpose yourself to the 500\ncompanies that comprises\nthe S&P500, therefore\ndiversifying away all\nnon-systematic risks.\nFor investors that are\nlooking for returns above\nthe market (S&P500),\nthey should split their\noptimal portfolio into an\nactive and passive portfo-lio, whereby the passive\nportfolio consists of\nETFs, bonds and treasury\nnotes.

The increase is due\nto new costs included in\nthe break-even model\nthat were not included in\nprevious years \u2013 in other\nwords, from next year\nnew students will be being\ncharged for services as\npart of their halls rent that\ntheir predecessors did not\nhave to pay towards.\nThis breakeven condition currently acts as a\nstrong constraint on the\nnegotiations; the options\nof the Union in their consultation role is primarily\nto decide how the price\nhike will be distributed\nacross different halls.\nThe renegotiation\nprecedes the opening of\nthe new Kemp Porter\nhalls in Acton, adjacent to\nWoodward and featuring\nfunctionally identical\nrooms. The opening of the\nnew hall, featuring over\n700 bedspaces, will shift\nhalf of all first-year students to Acton, with the\ndistribution of first-year\nstudents between South\nKensington and Acton\nhalls becoming 51% to\n49% respectively - as\nopposed to 73% to 27% in\nthe 2019/20 year.\nThe Deputy President\n(Welfare) and Union\nPresident will be taking\nthe issue to Union\nCouncil on Tuesday 3rd\nDecember, which will be\nheld in Sherfield\u2019s Read\nlecture theatre at 7pm\nand to which they have\nstrongly encouraged any\nand all students to attend.\nThe paper they have prepared outlines four initial\noptions as a starting point\nfor discussion, though\nthe Council can decide to\nreject all four.\nAt the last rent negotiation prior to the opening of\nWoodward in 2015/16, the\nUnion Council decided to\nset a ratio of 2:1 in terms\nof cost per square metre\nbetween South Kensington and Acton halls, with\nthe justification being that\nit ensured a set of affordable halls for a quarter of\nstudents in Acton on a\n\u201csubsidy\u201d basis from the\nremaining three-quarters\nof students in South Kensington. However, the shift\nin student distribution\nmeans a discussion about\nthe degree of subsidy\nneeds to be revisited.\nThis is the basis of the\nmajor differences between\nthe four options proposed\nin the paper \u2013 in essence,\nwhether to continue the\npractice of charging a 2:1\nratio and applying a flat\n12.2% price hike across\nall halls, or shifting that\nratio to either a greater\nor lesser extreme. Subsidising the Acton halls\nensures affordable halls\nand accessibility to the\nuniversity, whereas a vote\nto flatten prices reduces\nthe growing problem of\nsocial segregation in the\nCollege community.\nThe new Kemp Porter halls will open in the 2020-21 academic year // Thomas Angus\nCollege Plans to Increase Halls Rent Again; Union to\nNegotiate Prices\nISSUE 1736\nNEWS\nFELIX\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTheCollegeandtheUnionarerenegotiatingrentpricesthisyear,fiveyearsonfromtheconstructionofWoodward\nand just prior to the opening of the new Kemp Porter halls\n\u201cThe\nCollege's total\nnecessary\nrevenue from\nhalls rent to\nbreak even is\nincreasing by\n12.2%\u201d\nSome students are already\ncalling for the College to\nsubsidise halls from other\nrevenue streams rather\nthan continue to work on\na break-even basis.\nRegardless of which\noption one would choose,\nthe prices of halls are\nreaching a crux point.\nThey are no longer much,\nif any, cheaper than\nprivate accommodation.\nThe College provides a\ncost breakdown for budgeting for new students on\ntheir website, which itself\nstates that the average cost\nfor halls of residence and\nprivate accommodation\nonly differ by \u00a31.31 per\nweek. As an alternate\nmetric: the proposed new\nprices for a single ensuite\nroom in Beit \u2013 the type\nof room for which they\nhave the most bedspaces\n\u2013 are around \u00a3260 a week.\nSpareroom provides\naverage rental prices by\npostcode, and SW7\u2019s is\nbetween \u00a3230 and \u00a3300 \u2013\na search for properties in\na more specific area local\nto the South Kensington\ncampus yields multiple\nresults in the \u00a3260 region.\nThe same applies for the\nActon halls.\nThough halls provide\nsocial opportunities that\nare beneficial for new\nstudents, the cost of\npaying enough to reach\nthe break-even point at\nthe College is apparently\nequivalent to the cost of\npaying for the profit of a\nprivate landlord.\nFelix will report on\nthe results of the Union\nCouncil meeting in the\nfinal issue of term.\n\u201cSome\nstudents\nare calling\nfor College\nto subsidise\nhalls from\nother revenue\nstreams\u201d\nThe four options also\nwork on the basis of some\ninitial suggestions, such as\nkeeping the cost of Kemp\nPorter and Woodward the\nsame, as well as evening\nthe cost between Southside and Eastside halls in\nPrince\u2019s Gardens.\nA noteworthy point in\nthe Council paper is that\nthe option also exists to\nreject the break-even\nmodel entirely, at which\npoint the process would\nstop while the Union\nre-approached the College\nto determine next steps.\n3\n\n"

An\nasphalt jungle\nlit by neon\nlights. The\nbrutal trek up the Tiger\u2019s\nHead and down towards\nthe beaches of Discovery\nBay. A mere cog in the\nglobal economy machin-ery. For me it was all that\nand more. But somehow\nsix thousand miles away\nfrom the city I called\nhome, I\u2019ve now come to\nrealise I never knew it at\nall. This my dear reader, is\nmy confession.\nIn September, I boarded\nthe flight CX251 and\nleft the only home I had\never known. I must have\ndropped my heart and\nsoul somewhere on aisle\nC because it was gone by\nthe time I got here. I like\nto think it\u2019s debilitating\npowerlessness that I feel,\nbecause the alternative \u2013 a\ndetached numbness that\ncomes with not caring\nenough \u2013 is far worse.\nI wished for a thousand\nsleepless nights, and upon\na dying star I found guilt\nto keep me company at\nnight. When the lo-fi beats\nare left on playback it\ncomes knocking on my\ndoor. Traitor, traitor\u2026\nYou have no right to speak\nof your home. I welcome\nit in with open arms each\nnight. It reminds me that\nthere is no joy, only guilt.\nIn exchange I am\nrelieved of duty. I only\nread the headlines each\nmorning. I skip the videos\nand skim the updates. So\nlittle time to spare. So little\ntime to care. Yes, I shed a\ntear when I watched the\nworld speeds by at an\nincomprehensible pace?\nThere should be a word\nto describe it if there isn\u2019t\nalready. It\u2019s where I went\nto leave the world behind.\nI stayed there for a day,\na week, a lifetime. Until\na chirp-less robin visited\nme and made roost on my\nparapet.\nIt sought company in\nsilence. But the silence\nwas mine and mine alone.\nFrom the fragrant\nharbour it had come, and\nback to the harbour it\nwent. I pitied the bird that\nflew six thousand miles\njust to lose its voice. And\nso, I followed it out of\nthe bubble, if only just\nto mock its unfortunate\ncircumstance. Like Melpomene on a new year I\nlaugh.\nThe fragrant harbour it\ncame from is long gone.\nOnce a small fishing port\nwhere the sea met the\nsand. If you wandered out\ntoo far from the shore,\nyou\u2019d catch the siren call\nof pink-flushed dolphins.\nIt was poor before it\nprospered. It too, bled in\nthe war. It too, has had\nits share of sickness and\ndisease.\nMy home lost to the\nwinds.\nI mourn the death of\nHong Kong as we once\nknew it. It is far too late,\nand far too easy to talk\nabout right and wrong.\nThat line has been buried\nunder the blood, sweat\nand tears or both sides.\nProtestors, they lash out\nin desperation. The police\nlash out in frustration.\nFake news tears wider\nthe rift between the two\nsides. Misinformation\ncheapens the sacrifices\nthat have been made.\nEmotionally charged\nvideos spread through the\ninternet, preying on the\nhigh tensions and volatile\nemotions. But only in\ntheir respective algorithmic bubbles. Why look to\nthe US when we are but\na bargaining chip? They\nwon\u2019t have HK\u2019s best\ninterests at heart.\nHypocrisy in action,\nandininaction.Blindunity\nin the factions allowing\ninjustice to thrive. Dishonourable tactics and\nirredeemable actions have\nlost the police force any\nrespect they had built. The\nno-compromise stance\nadopted on both sides.\nProtests and gatherings\nbeing banned, forcing\nprotestors to embrace illegality in the movement.\nDehumanising the enemy\nto justify the slow descent\ninto full out brawls. Lone,\nindependent actors with\nsenseless actions that\nhave pervaded any moral\nground either side held.\nThe general mistrust of\nthe PRC and now by\nextension the Hong Kong\nGovernment. Even the\nsanctity of free press has\nbeen called into question.\nPerception is far more\npotent than the truth.\nWhether or not the government is a conniving\nbastard doesn\u2019t matter.\nThe fact that the people\nsee them as such does.\nNegotiations and talks\nhave no meaning without\ntrust.\nTherein lies the\ndilemma. How is resolution even possible without\na complete crackdown\nor complete reform?\nFurther convoluting the\nsituation is the leaderless\nstructure of the protests.\nNo structure for official\nnegotiation. I believe the\ngovernment is trying, but\nrhetorical appeasement\nhas proved insufficient\nin the face of all the bot-tled-up frustration.\nAll of the violence is\nmerely a symptom of a\nwound left unattended.\nFor an blissful 20 years we\ntreated 2047, the distant\ndate of total reunification,\nas a bridge to be crossed\nwhen we get there instead\nof confronting the inevitable redintegration back\nto the Mainland. Perhaps\nI should reword it, for 20\nyears we have given the\ncontrol of our future to the\nsaid, no. Bootleggers\ncrossed the border causing\nsevere milk-powder\nshortages. Middle-aged\nwomen came to perform\nfor lonely men in the parks\nfor money. Disappearances of book vendors with\n\u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d\npublications. And in 2010\na whole 36.9% of the\nbabies born in Hong Kong\ndidn\u2019t have a single parent\nthat was a Hong Kong\nresident. That\u2019s not even\nto mention the forced\nconstruction of the high-speed rail connecting the\nmainland and downtown\nHK a whole different can\nof worms. I mean, who\u2019d\nhave guessed half an hour\nbus ride is no deterrent?\nNot even the Sonoran\nDesert would stop them.\n2014 was when we tried\nto take the steering wheel\nwith universal suffrage.\nWe came, we saw, we lost.\nIn the subsequent years\nmany of those who participated were silenced,\nsentenced and jailed\nwhile society moved on.\nThe gears of economy\nnever stopped for the little\nharbour. Housing prices\ncontinued climbing, the\naverage property in HK\ncosts $1.2 million. For\n430 sq ft.\nHere we are today in\n2019, the situation ever\nso dire. My aim today\nis to show you how\ncomplex the situation is.\nEach sentence could be\nan article, each article an\nessay. There isn\u2019t a one\nsize fit all. I\u2019ve heard\npeople say, \u201cLet the army\nstorm the city to restore\norder!\u201d Just as I\u2019ve heard\nsomeone say, \u201cWe can go\nfull revolution with Hong\nKong Independence!\u201d\nAsinine remarks thrown\naround in ignorance.\nI don\u2019t have the truth,\nnor does anyone else who\nclaims to do so. Maybe we\nare foolish for fighting,\nmaybe we are wrong. At\nleast we fought knowing\nwe are in this together. For\nthose who have chosen to\ncontinue the good fight\nwith their hearts fuelled\nby righteous faith, I quote\nto you Dylan Thomas\n\u201cRage, rage against the\ndying of the light.\u201d As we\nwield our sword (or pen)\nin the name of justice, let\nus carry a healthy dose of\ncynicism and self-critique\nlest we forget that the road\nto hell is paved with good\nintentions. If my article\nhas incited anger, then I\nhave failed.\nTo stop and listen, is to\ngive voice to those who\ncannot be heard over the\ncrowd. Blue. Yellow. On\nthe fence. I ask for simple\nreprieve. An interlude\nof last green in waning\nlight. A moment of silence\nfor those that have died\nfor their ideals; officers\ninjured in the line of duty;\nteenagers who have made\nthis their fight; parents\nwho just pray for safe\nreturns; and children that\nwill grow up in a divided\nfamily.\nThe battle has long\nago turned into a war of\nattrition. And while the\ncity still burns in the back-ground, I think it is time\nto take off the collimator.\nAway from the fragrant\nharbour\u2026 Westwards to\nLebanon, Egypt, France,\nChile, Peru... In fact, all\nthe other places that have\nfought in the dark. My\nheart goes out to every\nsingle one of you. This\nworld is far too small of a\nplace for us to not give a\ndamn.\n\u201cI mourn the\ndeath of Hong\nKong as we\nonce knew it\u201d\nvideo where a teenager\nwas shot. But then I\nmoved on. I had lectures\nto watch. Problem sheets\nto hand in.\nHave you ever been to\nthat small, muffled bubble\nthat lies just out of sync\nwith reality? Where the\n\u201cAll of the\nviolence is\nmerely a\nsymptom of\nan unattended\nwound\u201d\nMainland government.\nThey wasted no time\nwith \u201cnational security\nreform\u201d in 2003, to\n\u201cnational re-education\u201d\nin 2012. We protested in\ndefiance. Defiance, not\nrevolution. We simply\n\n"

    "content": "Binge of the Week: Russian Doll\nN\ne t f l i x \u2019 s\nd r a m e d y\nRussian Doll\nfollows Nadia\nVulvokov (played by\nNatasha Lyonne), a software developer who finds\nherself stuck in a time loop\nwhere she repeatedly dies\nand mysteriously relives\nher 36th birthday party.\nNadia has to fix the \u201cbug\u201d\nin the code that is her life\nin order to escape this\ninevitable crash. On her\nquest for an answer, she\nfinds her polar-opposite,\nAlan Zaveri (played by\nCharlie Barnett), who experiences the same thing.\nTogether, they must face\ntheir deepest fears and\nhelp each other out to get\nout of this sticky situation.\nThe highlight of the\nshow is none other than\nNatasha Lyonne. The\nentire series is framed\naround Nadia, although\nit\u2019s not labeled as a\none-woman show, it\u2019s\nhonestly not far from\nit. Lyonne\u2019s spectacular\nacting brings the character\nof Nadia to life, and part\nof that can be attributed to how closely her\npersonal life resembles\nthat of Nadia\u2019s. On the\noutside, like Nadia, she\ngrows up in an estranged\nJewish family in New\nYork and suffers health\nproblems due to her\nalcohol and substance\nabuse problems. But what\nis really impressive is her\npoignant delivery and\nhow she conveys Nadia\u2019s\nemotional turmoil underneath her carefree, hippy\nfacade. Lyonne\u2019s portrayal of Nadia, the strikingly\nidiosyncratic redhead has\nundoubtedly created yet\nanother New York icon.\nThis is not to undermine\nthe supporting characters\nof the show who are some\nof the most well-written\nthat I have seen.\nThe plot is yet another\nhighlight for me and is essentially what bridges the\ngenres of drama, comedy,\nmystery, and horror. Upon\nmy first watch, I felt the\nplot started off rather slow\nwith coincidences unreasonably stretched. It was\nthe mystery elements that\nI didn\u2019t quite get the first\ntime around, but overall\nI still found it enjoyable.\nIt\u2019s the rewatch that made\nme appreciate Russian\nDoll on another level.\nThere\u2019s a layer of depth\nto the series that I wasn\u2019t\nable to grasp when I first\nwatched it. Every scene is\ncrafted with such attention\nto detail, serving as a way\nfor character development\nor to foreshadow what\u2019s\nto come eventually. In this\nshow, not a single second\nis wasted.\nSomething that helps\nexplain the mechanics\nof time traveling in this\nparticular case is Nadia\u2019s\nprogramming analogy\n(which coincidentally\nfits her character). If\nher life were a program,\nthen being stuck in this\nunending loop is the\ncrash, and the way out\nis to find and fix the bug\nof her life. Then she and\nAlan would \u201crewrite\u201d\ntheir first interaction, run\na unit test, \u201csee if the bug\nis triggered,\u201d and if it is,\nthey would both die and\ngo back to the deli where\nit all started. This explains\nwhy in the subsequent\nepisodes certain characters disappear into thin\nair - it\u2019s their way to determine if the bug is trig-gered, by stripping down\nthe program to its absolute\ncore. Every movie or TV\nshow that deals with\ntime-traveling always\nfinds itself in need of a\nscene of explanation, and\nI thought Russian Doll\u2019s\nmetaphor to achieve this\nis pretty neat.\nAs a cinematography\nnerd, I want to applaud the\ncinematographer Chris\nTeague for Russian Doll\u2019s\nunique visual language\nthat perfectly ties in the\ncyclical time elements\nwith the New York\nsetting. It blends subtlety\nand vibrancy that brings\nout the retro, depressing\ncity vibes with Teague\u2019s\ncreative use of neon lights\nin the dark. Different\nfilters are used with\nexceptional precision to\nconvey the mood and tone\nof each scene or character,\nbut Teague manages to\nmaintain a cohesive style\nthroughout the show. The\nflashback scenes are shot\nwith older lenses and\nfeature a warmer colour\npalette. Part of what distinguishes between a horror\nand a comedic scene is\nthe cinematography. Not\nto mention how perfect\nevery detail is in the\nclassic reset scene where\nNadia finds herself resurrected in the bathroom\nof Maxine\u2019s (played by\nGreta Lee) loft, accompanied by Harry Nilsson\u2019s\n\u201cGotta Get Up.\u201d The final\nscene concludes the series\nso satisfyingly and a huge\npart of it can be attributed\nto the cinematography.\nRussian Doll is not only\nfull of unexpected twists\nand turns but also important overarching themes\nthat echo throughout the\nseries told through a beau-tiful, gripping story. I am\ndelighted to hear that the\nshow has been renewed\nfor a second season, and I\ncannot wait to see where\nthe writers take this show.\nA fascinating tale based on the classic \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d premise, featuring time loops, bug-fixing, comedic\nhorrors, and facing fears\nNatasha Lyonne stuns as Nadia Vulvokov in Russian Do // Netflix\nISSUE 1736\nFELIX\nTELEVISION tv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n25\nTELEVISION\nJia Qi Tan\nTV Editor\nCreator: Natasha Lyonne,\nLeslye Headland, Amy\nPoehler Starring: Natasha\nLyonne\nSEASON 1\n\n"

Are they voting for\nthorough policies outlined\nin a manifesto or headline\nideas performed on TV?\nIs it about the local candidate in their constituency\nor the celebrity like figure\nwho leads that party?\nThis week, the election\ncampaign has trudged\non and some important\nevents have taken place:\nTV debates and manifesto\nlaunches. We have had the\nfirst of a series of debates\nand interviews with party\nleaders going head to\nhead, under the spotlight\nfor millions at home to\nsee. We have also been\ntreated with hundreds of\npages of manifestos to not\nread from all the major\nparties, outlining policies\nand pledges.\nFor politicians, these\nmanifestos might seem\nhugely important and it is\ntrue that key policies in the\npast have swayed voters\nbut in a post-truth era, is\nthis all changing? Many\nvoters do not believe a\nword a politician says,\nwrites or even carves onto\na stone tablet. This does\nnot necessarily mean that\nthey won\u2019t vote for them,\nbut whether they pledge\n10 or 100 billion on the\nNHS, the voters will take\nit all with a pinch of salt.\nThis is partially due to the\nfact that so many election\npledges in recent years\nhave been broken. These\nbroken promises range\nWhen voters put their X\nin the box on a cold night\nin December, it won\u2019t be a\nParty or a manifesto they\nare voting for but a local\ncandidate. Most people\ntake little notice of this\nperson and look instead\nat the party leaders. These\nare the people who could\nbecome our nations prime\nminister. For some, it\nis the qualities of this\nperson, whether it be\nleadership or trustworthi-ness, that matters most.\nAll the leaders will use\ntheir public appearances\nand TV performances to\ntry and shine a light on\nthese characteristics. For\nexample Boris Johnson repeating his Brexit mantra\n35 million times to show\nhe is a man of conviction.\nJo Swinson showing\nstrong leadership\u2026 of\nher finger as she presses\nthe red button for nuclear\nannihilation. The way the\nleaders interact with the\nmoderators, audience and\nof course their opponents\ngives a unique insight into\ntheir temperament. Even\nwhen asked the toughest\nquestions, will they keep\ntheir cool?\nDespite the temptation\nof focusing on circus of\nall of it, I believe a party\nshould be judged on its\npolicies past, present and\nfuture. The manifestoes\nhelp paint part of the\nbut must be put into\nheld by the Conservative\nleader. Furthermore, the\nrampant spreading of fake\nnews and the tendency to\nunderstate the truth by top\npoliticians is definitely\nsomething to watch out\nfor. Trustworthiness is\nbecoming a rare thing,\nbut we must not accept\nto be fed straight lies and\nmust reject anyone who\npeddles them.\nOverall, this election\nshould be about a wide\nrange of policies and the\ngeneral direction that\ndifferent parties want to\npush the country towards.\nFor example, Labour\npledge 28 pounds for\nevery pound the Tories do\ntowards public services.\nReading manifestos in\nthe context of the party\u2019s\npast performance is key\nto do this. As the media\nwhips of a storm about\neach leader\u2019s performance\nduring interviews and\ndebates, it is important to\ntake a step back and really\nremember that policy is\nalways more important\nthan this pageantry. The\nnext leader of our nation\nFinally, a political piece\nwritten in the post-Cam-eron era would not be\ncomplete without a little\nmention of Brexit. This\nelection is of course being\nviewed by some as a qua-si-referendum, and thus\nfor them all that matters\nis a party\u2019s position on\nBrexit. Not what the\nmanifesto outlines on\npaper or what the leader\nsays on stage. Although I\nbelieve that Brexit should\nplay a part in the decision,\nit should only be part of a\nbigger picture when determining who to vote for.\nCaricatures of Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson// Flickr\ncontext with the party\u2019s\nrecent history. However,\ndoes this mean that the\nbehaviour and characteristics of each leader is not\nimportant? I do believe\nthat in the current age of\npopularism, these factors\nare often overstated but\nthere is some weight that\nshould be given to them.\nThe language and rhetoric\nused by the leaders is definitelyone.BorisJohnson\u2019s\ncomments about Muslim\nwomen looking like letter\nboxes and bank robbers\nor calling members of\nthe LGBTQ+ community\nbum boys are examples.\nThese are not policies,\nbut rather point towards\nthe beliefs and values\nfrom university tuition\nfees to the NHS, and from\nimmigration targets to air\nquality. Wide reaching\nbroken promises mean\nthat trust has been broken\nacross all demographics.\nThis dangerous cycle\nis self-fulfilling. As less\npeople believe pledges,\nthe less politicians will\nwork to complete their\npledges. If the public\nalready believes the\npolicies will never be\ncarried through, the repercussions for that are not\nas harsh. For this reason,\nI believe it is really important to read manifestos\nand try to understand what\nareas different parties put\nimportance on.\n\n"
