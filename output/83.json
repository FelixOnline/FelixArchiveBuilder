    "content": "FELIX SPORTS NEW SI.C. CC.C. BEAT SHEFFIELD\nOverwhelming Victory\nIn what was un doubt ably our best match of the season to date, the Croes Country Club heavily defeat\ned Sheffield University and Leicester University\nCollege at Sheffield last Saturday. The five-mile\ncourse o 'er hill and dale (mainly hill) was the\nsame as last year, when Sheffield beat us.\nThe pace was very fast throughout, some of\nus knocking two minutes off last year's time. There\nis no doubt that we would have scored an even more\nresounding victory, were it not for the team's aversion to farmyard animals with horns, which caused a number of detours. However, no-one was imp al ed, although Dearden lost his shorts temporarily\non a barbed-wire fence, and we finished with our\nsix scoring men in the first eight home.\nThe Leicester men did not put in an appearance\nuntil all the I.C. runners were in. Our scoring\nteam was Cotter ill(2 nd), Barber (4th), Webster(5)\nAnsell (his best run for years - 6th), Rogers(7th) and Wood (8th). The best was still to come. The victorious\nteam headed back to town with the proverbial tin of red paint, which was liberally applied.\nThe less said of this side of the affair the\nbetter, but it is a fact that S nd-rs-n had to be\nforcibly restrained from performing breakneck\ncallisthenics in a railway carriage.\nWinter Championships\n'in Wednesday Nov. 16th. a team of Athletes, hurriedly selected as a result of the 14 days notice given\nby the University authorities, competed in the lira t winter Field Kvents and Relays Championships to be\nheld for fifty years at Motspur Park.\nIn the Field Events, teams of two competitors\nwere entered for each event and their aggregate\ndistance, thrown or jumped, was the basis of the\npoints awarded.\nure at praise must be given to the small team\nof eight who completed in the seven events and\nwhose sterling performances under adverse conditions\ngave them overall first place with 25 points.\nResults\nSnot P.

Tn the three Relay races, those of 4 110 yd s.220440220 and8801 mile 880, the fortune e of I.C. were rather mixed.\nThe Sprint Relay team of Reran, Hobson, Mackenzie and Hooper ran 4thin their heat and were\nthus eliminated. The other sprint team were scratched whilst the 2-mile \u00abed ley team of H. Pincent,\nJ. Evans and L. Locke had a runaway victory by over\n100 yd s. from a rather tire dU.C. team.\nIt is hoped that meetings of this type can\nbe held at more frequent dates throughout tJ M winter to keep University athlete e in racing fit ness for next seasons programme.\nHOCKEY Since the last report in Felix, the fortunes of the\nClub have been varied. The 1st. XI lost narrowly to Hendon,\nand to St. Catherine's College, Cambridge, in the return fix-ture. However, a resounding 9-1 victory was recorded against\ni heAr r\\y( London District). F. CM.Sillett and Hashim Khan have\nnow Joined the side and should do much to in areas e our cha noes in the seo on d round of the U.L. Cup, against U.C. next Wednesday. J.I \u2014Tayler continues to be the leading goal-scorer.\nThe second and third elevens have not yet played according to expectations. It has been suggested that some players might benefit from a rigorous early morning training pro-gram me. With the cooperation of I.C. W.S.C. the mixed XI is both popular and successful, having so far won two matches\nand lost one.\nUNIVERSITY BOXING TRIAL SI.C. WIN PRESTON CUP Gordon Halsey,(R. S.K.) in stripes, boxing Hayes (rings).\nOn Thursday, Nov. 17th. the College,ren resent eri by :or be tt, Baker , McKenzie, Moorhouse, Shepherd,\nHalsey and the captain, Palmer, competed in the\nUniversity trials. The competition was organised\naccording to A.B.A. weight groups. The final result was:I.C.22 points; Kings 11; and London Hospi tal8. Palmer won the featherweight division on a walk-over. In the light-welterweights, Shepherd,\nboxing against Wood of Westminster College, an\northodox boxer with a good left hand, managed, by\nhis tenacity and superior punching-to floor his\nopponent twice before the contest was caller! to\na halt with Wood on the floor in the second round,\nG. Walsey meeting Hayes of King's, who had\nprevious'y displayed his tough capabilities by\nbeating Kelly (London Hospital) in an elimination\nbout earlier on, tried very hard.(proving such\ntough opposition indeed, that Hayes who eventually\nwon on points decided to withdraw from the competition and so made Shepherd the winner) and showed\nconsiderable talent with a long straight left wh i oh scored many times but through attempting to use a right hand at the wrong time left himself wide\nopen to Hayes3\nvery accurate left s. Welterweight- H. McKenzie in a very weak state\nthrough weight trouble put up a good showing against\nWhitfield of St. Georges (a previous London Team\nBoxer) but was too slow and was usually beaten to\nthe punch by his very cool opponent who won on\npoints.\nWhitfield went on ten minutes later to beat\na very plucky Imperial man, Moorehouse, who\ncarried the fight to his man for much of the bout\nalthough taking considerable punishment.\nIn the semi-final at the light heavyweight\ndivision two Imperial men, Corbett and Baker,\npassed through three rounds of very orthodox\nboxing in which Baker through a stronger left hand\nand safer defence won on points. The other semi-final winner withdrew and Baker was dee lau ed the\nwinner.\nSQUASH With the approach of the U.L. three-a a i \u00abc Squash\ntournament the Imperial College Squash team stands\nconfident as it has a one hundred percent record\nof victories. Recent matches included two at Cambridge wher s St. Catherine's and Queen's College were defeated\nand a visit to St. Edmund Hall, Oxford, where\nthe team, she wed great skill. and spirit in beating\na redoubtable side.\nPublished by FELIX BOARD, Imperial Colleje Union, London, S.W.7.

XT\nappears to have lost a little of its fir*, but, nevertheless, continues to play good rugby ana\nhas noticeably improved Its defence ee that in the\nlast three Batches I.C. has not conceded a point.\ni Vga ln st University College at Shenley, the\nscene of past disasters, I.C. took some time to\nsettle. own, and in the first half with the exception of one or two solitary breaks neither side\nlooked like scoring. In the second half, however,\na persistent onslaught on the U.C. line was maintained and tn'y the excellent spoiling of the\non position wing forwards prevented the scoring of\ntries. After an attempted dropped goal by Holman\nthat struck the crossbar and a dive over the U.C. line in the corner by Reynolds who was held by the\nreferee to be in touch the match was clinched by a penalty goal kicked by Hearn, The great reserve\nstrength of T.C. compared with other colleges was\nemphasised by the 2nd. XV s deo is i we win.\nThe following Saturday the 1st.,2 nd. and \"A\" XVs entertained London Welsh at Harlington, a fixture that is looked forward to with enthusiasm\nby mah y stalwarts of the club. The 1st, XV match\nwas noteworthy for the better tackling of the I.C. backs. On the few occasions on which the ball was\nallowed down on * line there appeared, however, a lack of thrust and scoring chances in the first half\nwere few. The forwards procured more of the ball in the second half and the previously scrappy lin emt play was tightened up to some degree. Same\nunfortunate attempts at goal from penalties and\na narrow iy missed dropped kick a* goal were followed\nby a try from Whitmore who scrambled home after gathering a bouncing ball from a high free kick.\nThe try was converted into a jo al by a fine kick\nby Hearn.\nThe full repercussions of the lively evening\nin the bar afterwards are not yet known, but perhaps for the first time the College outnumbered\nthe \"Welsh\" whose singing, spirited though it was\ndid not come up to their usual high standard.\nRRSUI TS\nSat.

The hand full filled its function adequately enough, altho ought ne trumpeter\nshowed a certain lack of stamina towards the end,\nbut, as on many previous occasions, the floor was\nfar too crowded for dancing in reasonable comfort.\nThere are only two solutions to the problem\nof overcrowding, apart from raising the price of\nadmission which of course, the Union would rightly forbid having only last year fixed the present maximum charges.\nThe first of these solution is to still fur ter reduce the number of tickets available, this number\nbeing far too small even now. One must strongly\ndisapprove such a drastic step. Moreover, the all im nor tant takings would decline as a result. In view of these unsatisfactory alternatives\nthe Union must direct its energies in the direction\nof obtaining a larger hall or halls in which to hold\nits functions.\nLast session dances were held in the Imperial\nInstitute and in Queen Alexandra's House, of which\nthe latter was the more pleasant venue. Many aim\nstudents will recall with pleasure the Jazz Dance\nheld in Q.A. at which the TUrmingham University\nJazz Club helped to provide entertainment.\nIt is to be hoped that some similar solution\nto the problem will be f> und this year by Union\nEntertainments Committee-in time for the Easter\nt? rm.\nBelow The Telephone exchange at Silwood Park after\nit had been struck by lightening during the last\nTouchstone Weekend.

MACHINES HIRED WEEKLY OR MONTHLY\nREPORT: Time and Motion Study\nLocation: The 'Proms'.\nGeneral\"Remarke: - Positioning poor; orchestras could\nbe accomodate d in smaller space if seated in para-ll el line eine tea d of ragged semicircles. Dress of\noperator a extravagant; ordinary civilian clothing\nwould be perfectly adequate for all but a Royal Performance.\nSubject: - Programme devoted to works at least fifty years old; management should experiment with newer '\nmaterial, ,\nEfficiency: - (a) of manpower: Unnecessary dup it ic ation by violins all playing identical notes; staff\nof this section should be drastically cut and a larger volume of sound obtained by means of electronic\napparatus. Many wind and percussion instruments are\nunused for considerable periods; their work should\nbe spread more evenly over the concert, thus eli mino a ting peaks of activity. This would make possible a further saving in manpower.\n(b) of time: No useful purpose served\nby repeating on the horns a passage already handled\nby the strings. This type of situation occurs all too frequently. The scores should be drastically pruned in order to eliminate all such redundant pas-sages. Furthermore, there is no need for an interval as light refreshment might well be obtained during the periods set aside for applause.\n(c) of operators: Only the pianist makes full use of both hands and feet. Many opera t* ors not only have both feet idle, but are using one\nhand to hold their instrument. A fixture should be\nprovided in such cases, and the possibility of in creasing the proportion of pianos investigated.\n(d) of the foreman: The foreman's stick is far too short and flimsy to be an effective\nstimulant, and any effect it would have is lost\nthrough it being constantly in view. Slackers would\nbe more easily detected were the foreman to stand\nbehind the orchestra. It would also keep .the operators more on their toes when he did appear.\nj Be commend at ibn s?(i) That Prince Littler, Sir Henr\nWood, Sir Malcolm Sargent, and Messrs. Beethoven\nDelius and Handel be relieved of their present res\npon sibi li ties and replaced by a team more suited to\nmodern conditions.\n( ii) That Messrs.
