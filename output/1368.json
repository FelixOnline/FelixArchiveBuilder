Christopher Kane, Gareth\nPugh and Giles Deacon, Central\nSt. Martins' graduates, were the\nsource of the most boldly futuristic,\nvisually arresting designs.\nChristopher Kane, having had\nDonatella Versace sponsor his\nMA collection, is now working as\na freelance designer for Versace.\nThis show is Kane's first collection\nunder his own label. Those neon\ndresses may have guaranteed him\npublicity, as an illustration of the\nnew \"nu-rave\" trend which at the\nmoment exists purely in the pages\nof fashion magazines.\nHowever looking past the endless\nvariations of the same neon skintight 80's dress, there are some\ninterestingly structured dresses\nwhich play on the theme of volume,\nwhich is a common thread through\nmany of the catwalk shows. Also\ncommon through the shows is a\nmonochrome colour theme with\nmuted greys, contrasting with\nbursts of neon brights.\nGareth Pugh didn't disappoint\nwith another theatrical show undercut with humour.

    "content": "Sport partnership looking shaky\nSabbs concerned that the new sports partnership will lead to a \u201ctakeover\u201d of sports clubs by the College\nAt a meeting of the Union Executive\nthis week, Eric Lai (Deputy President for Clubs & Societies) cast\ndoubt on the sports partnership\nbetween the College\u2019s \u201cSport Imperial\u201d department and the Union.\nSport Imperial is responsible for\nall of the College\u2019s sports facilities,\nincluding Ethos and the training\ngrounds at Harlington. The Union is\nresponsible for running the sports\nclubs, through the Athletic Clubs\nCommittee (ACC). The partnership is ostensibly to be responsible\nfor directing \u201csports strategy\u201d, the\nargument being that sabbs are only\nin place for a year and get bogged\ndown in operational matters, and\ntherefore aren\u2019t able to think long-term about sport at the College; the\npartnership, featuring high-level\nCollege staff, should provide some\ncontinuity. The proposal for the\npartnership was floated last year,\nbut was rejected as it was felt by\nmany to be an attempt by the College to take over the sports teams.\nThis year, however, the partnership was approved, with enthusiastic backing from Mr Lai (DPCS),\nand a member of staff was employed\njointly by the Union and College to\noversee it. At the meeting, however,\nMr Lai spoke frankly about concerns he had about Sport Imperial\nattempting to take over events that\nhad previously been under the Union\u2019s remit.\nMr Lai gave a couple of examples.\nThe annual ACC dinner, where\nawards are given to the sports\nteams, has drawn the attention of\nSport Imperial, who are looking to\nmake it a \u201cSports Partnership\u201d din-ner. As a result, they plan to charge\n\u00a350 a ticket, and it currently stands\nto run during the exam period,\nand very close to the Summer Ball\n(which has a similar ticket price).\nAs such, Mr Lai said, there were\nconcerns over how many students\nwould attend. He also complained\nthat the ACC Chair, Luke Taylor,\nhad \u201coffered it [the dinner] on a\nplate\u201d to the College.\nSecondly, a Sports Festival that\nwas being organised by a student\nas a \u201cCentenary Event\u201d (to raise\nmoney for the Beit Masterplan or\nthe Student Opportunities Fund) is\nnow being run by Sport Imperial.\nAccording to the College, this event\nwill now not make a profit, and\ntherefore no money will end up in\nthe Union\u2019s coffers; this is despite\nthe fact that event would charge\n\u00a350 a team, with teams drawn from\nfour sports, participation from over\nten universities, and the possibility\nof corporate sponsorship. Felix\u2019s\nmagical calculator reckons this\nto be \u201ca heck of a lot of money\u201d,\nwithout even considering the huge\namount of money to made from the\nbar (given the relationship between\nsports teams and alcohol).\nMr Taylor refuted a number of\nthese points on Live!, calling Mr\nLai \u201can example of a particularly\ndeceitful breed of small minded\npolitician I have always feared he\nmay be.\u201d He says that the tickets\nfor the ACC dinner (rebranded as\nthe Sports Parternship dinner) will\ncost \u00a340, and that Sport Imperial\u2019s\ninvolvement will consist only of a\ntable of their representatives. He\nalso said that the statement about\nthe Sports Festival making no profit\nwere \u201cback of the envelope calculations\u201d and that the department had\nassured him any profits would get\nback to the Student Opportunity\nFund. How true this is remains to be\nseen, as a source within the Union\nhas referred to Sport Imperial as\n\u201calmost Machiavellian at times.\u201d\nMr Lai has previously been\nstrongly in favour of the partner-ship, but appears that recent\nevents have made him reconsider\nhis position.\nSo far, Sport Imperial have provided clubs with sports kit (total-ling \u00a345,000 worth) and instructors\n(nearly \u00a330,000).\nHowever, many clubs found the\nkit unsatisfactory, with no consultation of clubs prior to the kit being\nmade.

    "content": "ICU Debating Society has had a\nbusy term: so far we\u2019ve entered\ncompetitions at Bristol, Cambridge,\nthe English-Speaking Union and\nmost recently Kings. The main aim\nof the society is to train people in\nthe \u2018British Parliamentary Style\u2019 of\ndebating, which simply put means\ndebates of four teams of two people (two teams proposing the mo-tion, two opposing) with five minute\nspeeches. Although I attended\nBristol as a judge, the Cambridge\nIV on 17-18 November was my first\nchance this year to debate. Unsurprisingly it was quite a baptism of\nfire!\nDebateSoc sent two teams and\none judge along to what, along with\nOxford\u2019s IV (intervarsity), is one of\nthe highlights of the debating cal-endar. Stepping out from a packed\ntrain into the pouring rain, we had\nquite a soggy start to Friday night\u2019s\ntwo rounds in Cambridge\u2019s Union\nSociety building. This is a grand\nedifice originally erected in 1866,\nwith its own bar, a number of rooms\nfor smaller debates, and a large debating chamber big enough to accommodate the 88 teams that had\narrived from all over the world.\nThe format of the competition\nwas six rounds of motions everyone took part in, followed by the\n\u2018break\u2019 of highly-scoring teams\ninto the semi-finals, finishing with\nthe black-tie final in the chamber.\nUnusually for an IV, all the motions\nwere \u2018open\u2019 rather than \u2018closed\u2019;\nthat is to say, they were sufficiently vague so as to let the first team\nproposing the motion make it into\na debate on whatever subject they\nchose. Normally the motions are\nmuch more clearly defined. This\npolicy rather changed the dynamic\nof the debates, because the other\nteams were unable to make much\nuse of the 15 minutes preparation\none gets beforehand.\nPerhaps inevitably therefore,\nsome of the motions were slightly\u2026\nunorthodox. The first debate my\npartner Till and I had to tackle, as\nsecond prop, was along the lines of\n\u2018This House Would Freely Sell Viagra Over the Pharmacy Counter\u2019.\nAmusing as it was though, we managed to come up with some plausible reasons to support the idea,\nincluding the elimination of the internet black market and enhancement to everyday quality of life.\nWhen we got to propose a motion\nwe chose \u2018THW Introduce a Flat\nTax\u2019, as an issue I was familiar with\nfrom an earlier political debate.\nThe final was very entertain-ing. With a large, eager audience\ndressed up in black tie the debate\ntook on a more theatrical character,\nwith wit and passion demonstrated in equal measure. There were\ntwo teams from Yale, an Oxford\nand an Irish team. The proposing\nYale team, who went on to win the\ndebate and the competition as a\nwhole, proposed a motion allowing\nthe torture of terrorist suspects for\nintelligence information. Although\ncontentious, the opposition teams\nfailed to engage with the motion\nsignificantly beyond the obvious\nmoral objections, which was a surprise considering that the pros and\ncons of such an idea are relatively\nwell-worn on the debating circuit.\nAlthough the Irish team didn\u2019t win,\ntheir hoard of chanting supporters certainly added to the charged\natmosphere.\nImperial\u2019s two teams faired relatively well considering the strength\nof the competitors, coming about\nthree-quarters of the way down the\ntable. Special recognition must go\nto Till though, who did well on the\nindividual speaker tab. Debating is\na skill that requires regular practice against challenging teams to\nimprove, and as such I\u2019m sure that\nall our performances will improve\nover this year after a rather barren\nsummertime.\nAside from the debating though,\nthe social experience was enjoy-able. On both nights Imperial got\nits fair share of free alcohol, and the\nEmmanuel College fresher we were\ncrashing with generously toured us\naround Cambridge, showing us the\nkey sites of interest, such as Gardenia, aka Gardies the kebab shop.\nDebating really makes a wonderful break from science. Although\nscience certainly teaches you to\nthink analytically, I don\u2019t believe it\nprepares you for the challenge of\narticulating difficult arguments ver-bally, which is a very valuable skill\nindeed. Why not join DebateSoc,\nand broaden out your base a little?\nWe practice weekly on Wednesdays,\n6-8pm in SAF 199, as a prelude to\nentering actual competitions.\nSee www.icudebate.org for\nmore information on how to get\ninvolved with DebateSoc\nVerbal assault on Cambridge\n21\nfelix\nFriday 12 January 2007\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES clubsandsocs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nwalks in the entire District and was\nour plan for the day.\nIt is also a long and tough day\u2019s\nwalk with 1300m ascent over 10.5\nmiles. After walking up Mosdale\nfrom Wasdale Head, the ascent up\nto Black Sail Pass brought us into\nmist. We rose through it after Looking Stead (627m) and into astonishing views far and wide. The final\nascent to Pillar (892m) required\ntreading carefully on ice and snow,\nwith rewards of 360 degree views in\nthe sunshine.\nWe paused lengthily to eat bis-cuits, ahem, to remark on views to\nSkiddaw (13 miles) and to Scotland\n(40 miles). The ridge walk continued down via Wind Gap, then up\nto Black Crag (828m). We deviated\nfrom the horseshoe to go and bag\nLittle Scoat Fell (841m) too; beside\nthe wall summit cairn we lunched\nin the sunshine. Rejoining the ridge\nwalk down and up onto Red Pike\n(821m) gave some dramatic drops\non the eastern craggy side of Red\nPike.\nWe reached our decision point at\nDore Head col early enough to allow one final mountain: Yewbarrow\n(628m).Thismountain,althoughnot\nsubstantial in height, offers a tricky\nscramble up Stirrup Crag from\nDore Head. The scramble is \u201cnothing more than a strenuous exercise\nin elementary gymnastics\u201d according to Wainwright. It was a welcome\nchallenge! We enjoyed more excellent views in the late afternoon sunshine from the summit.\nWe descended via the remarkable\ncleft of the Great Door, Christine\nfaster than Nathaniel and I, notching up a decent 8/10 whilst using\nher posterior as a valuable agent\nof friction. We stopped to watch\nthe sunset over the valley. It was\nanother breathtaking scene and\nwe concluded that it was a great\nshame Mark had declined the day\non account of his ankle. Still we had\nenjoyed the day to the full. Back at\nthe barn we cooked up a remarkably tasty potato curry.\nThursday\nNo ambition to conquer the higher\nfells of the region would be satisfied\nwithout tackling Scafell. We chose\nthe Pike; initially we liked the idea\nof doing both, but with the icy conditions as they were, and the forecast\ncloud, it seemed over-ambitious. So\nthe Pike it was, with Mark joining\nus again.\nOnce more we started from Wasdale Head village green, heading south around Lingmell\u2019s flank\n(Chris losing her hat), then turning\neast up Brown Tongue. Once at Hollow Stones (~600m) we ascended\ninto cloud, but the north face tourist\npath had been chosen because this\nroute\u2019s snowed-covered cairns are\nfrequent enough to be followed in\nmist. The route brought us surprisingly swiftly to the wind-swept summit (978m); it seemed much easier\nthan yesterday\u2019s ascent. Luckily a\nguy turned up at the top in time to\ntake our photo.\nWe noted a day of more superla-tives: on the shortest day of the\nyear we were tackling the highest mountain in the worst weather\nwe\u2019d had all week! Retracing our\nfootsteps (literally in Mark\u2019s case)\ndown to Lingmell col we carried on\nup to Lingmell (807m). Our westward descent was punctuated with\nexcellent falls again from Chris and\nMark, both making notable contributions to the use of the rear appendage in mountaineering. Once\nbelow 400m the sunshine came out\nagain; it was quite warm. No final\nwalk should end without a trip to\nthe pub \u2013 after trying our best to\nuse up leftover ingredients for dinner we retired to the other village\npub, the Screes Inn. We were yet\nagain astounded by the multiplicative nature of the locals \u2013 the pub\nwas rammed, yet it\u2019s in the middle\nof nowhere!\nNathaniel cleverly noted that on\nthis Christmas tour we covered\n\u201cthe twelve fells of Christmas\u201d. Answers on a postcard. It was a fantastic week\u2019s fellwalking with excellent\ncompany, astonishing weather and\nsuperb fells. Here\u2019s to another year\nof fine walking and socialising!\nThis Christmas tour was the\nfirst Fellwanderers trip for which\nCO2 emissions from unavoidable transport and electricity have\nbeen carbon offset. Calculated CO2\nemissions for the week totalled 0.32\ntonnes (292Kg from diesel combus-tion), which cost \u00a32.42, as offset by\nClimateCare.org. The offset company was chosen because it adheres to the Gold Standard benchmark for \u2018high quality\u2019 carbon offset\nprojects, and will be used to offset\nfuture Fellwanderers\u2019 trips. Do ask\nme for further details.\nWe believe the Fellwanderers has\nvested interests in the environment\nand its preservation via the mitigation of climate change, because our\ntrips run to areas of natural beauty.\nDespite the already small impacts\nof our trips, I hope such an initiative can pave the way for more RCC\ntrips, maybe even as union-wide\npolicy in the future.\nThe Fellwanderers also organise\nweekend trips every fortnight; day\nwalks in and around London are\nalso fortnightly.\nSee www.fellwanderers.com\nfor details.

    "content": "Prophetic and startling\nThe Year of the Sex Olympics predicts Reality TV as an opiate of the masses\nBelieve it or not, I decided to see\nThe Year Of The Sex Olympics not\nbecause of its title, but on the basis\nof the ICA\u2019s description: \u201cterrifyingly prescient\u201d. This small summary\nproved itself to be highly accurate.\nIn the opening scenes we see a TV\nstudio directing a live broadcast of\n\u201cSport Sex\u201d, narrated by a frighteningly gleeful Misch (Vickery Turner), and controlled by Lasar and\nNat (Brian Cox, Tony Vogel). The\nfirst thing which strikes you (aside\nfrom Nat\u2019s maddening eyes) is the\nstrange dialect of English they\nspeak.\nIt is a m\u00e9lange of embarrassing\n1960s American slang spoken in a\nBritish accent (\u201csuper king\u201d), and\na degenerate grammar most ASBO\nwinners could correct. At one point\nMisch is heard remarking \u201cyou\ngone real mad-head\u201d. Well dear, I\ncertainly have.\nFrom Output (the broadcast\ncentre), Lasar and Nat watch live\nscreens of the audience to gauge\nDaniel Sykes\nCinemas are full of selfish bastards\nAs anyone who has been to see a\nfilm recently will have had forced\ninto their heads by a sneering scots-man, it\u2019s the experience that counts\nwhen going to the cinema. Not the\nquality of film or even of your fellow\ncinemagoers, apparently. The adverts which proclaim this entreat\nthose already in a cinema to go to\nthe cinema rather than downloading pirate recordings, which becomes particularly pointless when\nthe adverts are talking about the\nvery film you have just paid money\nto come and see. It\u2019s very much a\ncase of preaching to the choir.\nThese adverts are also fairly nonsensical in other regards - they describe the camera-angle of pirates\nas dodgy, when generally this angle\nis straight-on; they show the audience applauding, a very rare oc-curence unless the director is in the\nroom, and claim that the picture will\nbe much smaller, which is hardly a\nsurprise as most cinema screens I\nhave ever seen would dwarf an entire row of houses and, as yet, the\nhome cinema market does not have\nany screen larger than the homes\nthemselves. Most galling of all is\nthe claim that only pirate copies\nare spoilt by people in front getting\nup and going to the toilet.\nWhereas the truth is that the cinema is afflicted by this problem,\nand many more. To be quite frank,\ncinema etiquette appears not only\nto tolerate, but to positively encourage inconsiderate behaviour; this\ncan easily be observed by the disdain with which anyone daring to\ncomplain about anything is treated.\nThere is a culture of disapproval\nof so-called whingers rather than\nof the targets of these complaints\nwhich in turn leads to the suffering\nof such behaviour in silence.\nEven I, a very frequent cinema-goer and not one to keep my complaints to myself as you can probably tell, find myself affected by\nthis stiff upper lip mentality; I am\nfrequently subjected to a microcosm of human inconsideration in\nthe form of people chatting away\nduring the film, rustling packets of\nsweets and eating popcorn loudly,\nor simply kicking the seats in front\nwhen rearranging their feet every\nfive minutes or so.\nAnd yet, I am so unwilling to provoke a confrontation by asking people to perhaps close their mouths\nwhilst eating or to kindly stop talking for fear of being told to fuck off\nfor my troubles.\nBut what sort of culture sells food\nthat comes in rustly packaging or\nis, in itself, rustly in a place where\npeople would be wanting quiet?\nThough at least they have some\nlevel of consistency - every possible\nsense is bombarded, thanks to evil-smelling hot dogs to assail the nose,\nto be eaten in rooms full of still air,\nwhere people will be sitting still for\nhours on end.\nPerhaps I\u2019m just bitter from\nhaving Pan\u2019s Labyrinth, an otherwise excellent film which I would\nheartily recommend to those who\ndon\u2019t object to excessive brutality\nonscreen, ruined for me by having\ntheir enjoyment, and intermittently\nmake calls using phones on their\nwrists.\nThe Coordinator (Leonard Rossiter) is the only person in Output\nold enough to remember the \u201colddays time\u201d, and introduces us to\nthis strange world in a conversation\nwith Nat. Society has been split into\ntwo genetic groups, the high-drives\n(those we see in Output) and the\nlow-drives (the audience).\nThe audience are kept in a perpetual state of apathy by being shown\nuncensored programmes such as\n\u201cArt Sex\u201d and \u201cHungry And Angry\u201d.\nThe modus operandi of this world\nis \u201cwatching not doing\u201d. Since the\ndivision of society, war (\u201ctensions\u201d)\nhas been done away with, taking\nthe associated lexicon with it.\nAlready this film has the feel of a\nFriday night on Channel 4. Later,\nin a room where a robot is playing\nchess with itself, a strange man\ninsists that Nat see his mildly disturbing paintings. This man is unhappy with being a set designer, and\nwants people to see his pictures, to\nfeel \u201ctensions\u201d. Nat suggests he\nchange to designing the computerised shapes which float about the\nscreen between programmes.\nThe central plot of the film takes\nshape when the Coordinator announces to the broadcast team that\nThe Computer has suggested that\nthe audience would benefit from\nsome humorous\nprogrammes.\nThe team discover just the sort of\nprogramme they\nare looking for\nwhen the pained\nartist dies in an\naccident on set,\ncausing the audience to erupt\ninto laughter. The\nLive-Life Show is\nborn.\nNat, his low-drive child and\nher mother are\npopcorn thrown over me by a careless eejit with who then went on to\nchange seat three times in twenty\nminutes though not before poisoning the air next to me with hotdog\nfumes, hearing the constant chewing of popcorn from the man behind\nme, feeling the seats shake every\ntime a man along the row behind\ndecided he wasn\u2019t comfortable\nenough and hearing the rustling of a\nplastic bag which a mad woman insisted on clutching onto throughout\nthe film rather than putting it down\nsomewhere which shook whenever\nshe chose to read her magazine\nrather than watch the film (this was\nat roughly ten minute intervals).\nThis same woman kept talking to\nherself (and none too quietly), including the rather bizarre utterance\nwith regard to the advert encouraging people not to pirate Apocalypto,\non learning that it was by Mel Gibson; \u201coh no, he\u2019s not going to be racist in it, is he?\u201d Well, quite.\nAnd yet, I didn\u2019t say a word to\nanyone, instead deciding to be polite and simply glare resentfully at\nthe perpetrators who were, it has\nto be said, blithely oblivious to the\nwhole thing. I only wish other people could be quite so tolerant - at a\ndifferent showing I was talking to a\nfriend during the adverts before the\ntrailers, and a man shouted at us to\nshut the fuck up. An understandable sentiment were we doing so\nduring the film and maybe even, at\na push, during the trailers, but I can\nhardly see how the poor gentleman\nwas having his viewing experience\nruined by the adverts being spoilt.\nPerhaps the experience counted\nmore to him than I had realised.\nThis new year heralds a brand\nnew film section here in Felix.\nFrom this week, this page will be\na shrine to the cinematographic\narts of past, present and future:\nlovingly composed and presented\nwith lashings of bile and adoration\nin equal measures.\nIn light of this new approach, we\ntwo explosively exciting features.\nFirst is the competition this week,\noffering you the chance to win win\nwin a Breaking & Entering poster\nsigned by Jude Law and Anthony\nMinghella (see below for details).\nSecond, we launch a new fea-ture: the Posthumous Review.\nThis is a review, worship/hate-fully composed by anyone who\nfeels like it, of any film, no matter\nhow old. Ideally, you (yes, You) has\na film/director/actor that you believe does not receive the bile/love\nthat it rightfully deserves, and will\nleap at the chance to tell everyone\nwhy it is shit/great.

The future is dominated by 60s wallpaper\nWe have two autographed posters\nfrom the film Breaking & Entering, signed by Jude Law, Anthony\nMinghella and Rafi Gavron, to give\naway to you lucky idiots.\nAll you have to do to win these\ndelicious wall hangings is to email\nus at film.felix@ic.ac.uk with either an entertaining confession\nof your crimes, or simply name\nthe film in which the character\nin the top left corner of the page\nappears.\nSigned poster\ncompetition!\nGo on... shovel it down your fat throats you inconsiderate scum\nsent \u201coutside\u201d to live and be filmed\nin a cottage on a remote, apparently British, island. The Coordinator provides them with instructions\nabout the real world; about lighting\nfires, animals, and cooking.\nWhat Nat does not realise is that\nLasar has also released a psychopathic killer onto the island to provide the audience with the ultimate\nthrill. They haven\u2019t quite gone that\nfar on Big Brother or Celebrity\nLove Island, thank God.\nThroughout the film, there is a\npeculiarly English acceptance of\nthe status quo. The characters\nexpress no genuine hatred of the\nunderclass, nor make any attempt\nto moralise their society. Indeed,\nwhen Nat discovers has a low-drive\ndaughter, he cares for her, and\nYear of the Sex Olympics\nDirector: Michael Elliot\nWriter: Nigel Kneale\nCast: Leonard Rossiter\nTony Vogel\nBrian Cox\nseems more concerned for his own\nwell-being having broken the rules\nthan angry or disgusted.\nI found it truly amazing how well\na forty year-old film could predict\nhow television has progressed. It\ntouches on so many themes which\nperplex people today: genetic modi-fication, liberal use of anti-depres-sants, dependence on technology,\nsubservience of the masses to TV,\nthe numbing of the mind to extreme\ncontent and the paradox of reality\nTV (which Lasar sums up in his justification of the psychopath: \u201cit\u2019s a\nshow, something has to happen\u201d).\nUnfortunately the Institute Of\nContemporary Arts are not showing it again, but I recommend you\nsee this brilliant film if you ever get\nthe chance.\nFLIM\nGuess character: win poster\nHugh Stickley-Mansfield\nEver-present whinger\n11\nfelix\nFriday 12 January 2007\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Oh, sail away with me Mammy\npages 18 and 19\nCROSSWORD\nSUDOKU\nport\nS\nOff the beautiful South Beach, Miami, the Mumm 30 World Championships was held from 29 November\nto 2 December. The four-day event\nis one of sailing\u2019s premier yacht\nracing events, with over 30 teams\ncompeting for the coveted World\nChampions Trophy. I was there to\nrepresent Queen and Country and\nluckily for you I\u2019m here to take you\nthrough the highs and lows of the\nweek.\n10 races were scheduled to be\nsailed, and every race counted.\nThis meant one bad race could cost\nyou the event, and laid the path for\na high scoring event. Consistence\nis key to success here. I was sailing with a British/Irish team called\n\u2018Mammy\u2019; we were quite a new\nteam to the class, getting together\njust a few weeks prior to Miami. Onboard was Volvo Ocean Race winner and 18\u201d Skiff World Champion\nRob Greenhalgh, so there was no\nlack of talent in the team. However,\nit\u2019s time in the boat that counts and\nthe Mumm\u2019s have a great international circuit including the Tour de\nFrance \u00e0 la Voile. So we were entering as definite underdogs.\nThe team got off to a good start on\nthe first day, a fresh breeze and big\nwaves suited us, as we rapped up\nthe first day with an eight and two\nfirst places to be leading the event\noverall. However, it was early days\nwith seven races left to count.\nOn the second day the mistakes\ncame big and fast; after a great start\nin the first race we illegally hit the\nwindward mark \u2013 a truly schoolboy\nerror. We struggled to recover and\ngot sucked into the pack, finishing\nsixteenth. It didn\u2019t get any better in\nthe second and third races of the\nday, two bad starts and a port and\nstarboard incident meant we finished with a nineteenth and twenty-fourth respectively, to end the day\nin tenth place overall. A big rethink\nwas needed that night; racking up\n60 points in one day was no way to\nwin a world championship. 40 points\nno worse than five places behind\nthem in the final race. The final\nrace was to be sailed in the lightest\nand flattest conditions we\u2019d seen\nall week. A good start and (finally)\ngreat downwind boat speed meant\nwe finished on a high, with a fourth,\ngiving us eighth place overall. A\ngood result from a team with so little practice, but frustrating as we\nbehind the leaders meant our aims\nhad changed dramatically, finishing\ninside the top 10 was the goal now.\nThe third day was better, a fifth\nand sixth in the first two races was\nthe boost we needed. However, a\ntwenty-fifth place in the third race,\nour worst result of the competition,\nshowed there were still some prob-lems. This left us in eighth place\noverall with one race left to sail.\nClimbing any further up the leader\nboard was going to be very difficult.\nKeeping hold of eighth was the\nonly thing left, as we had four other\nteams knocking on the door just a\nfew points behind us; the European\nchampions (an all-British team),\ntwo Italian teams and an Australian\nteam. We had to ensure we finished\nshowed real glimpses of promise.\nThe 2006 TFV winners won\nthe event, a French team called\n\u2018Twins\u2019, completing a fantastic year\nfor them. Second were last year\u2019s\nMumm 30 world champions, an\nAustralian team called \u2018Foreign Affair\u2019. Finishing off the top 5 were the\nAmerican, Dutch, and Italian teams\nrespectively.\nTeam \u2018Mammy\u2019 who competed in the Mumm 30 World Championships held in Miami during December\nConnor Myant\nAdLib by Tevong You\nWWW.TEVONG.CO.UK\n\n"

    "content": "This year\u2019s Fellwanderers Winter\nTour was to Wasdale in the western\nLake District. The most isolated\nvalley in the Lakes has further superlatives to its fame: it contains\nWastwater, England\u2019s deepest lake\nand the valley\u2019s head is surrounded\nby some of England\u2019s tallest moun-tains, including Scafell Pike.\nOur base for the five days of\nwalking was Murt Farm Camping\nBarn, situated just outside Nether\nWasdale at the southwestern end\nof Wastwater. The reference Bible\nfor this region is Wainwright\u2019s, The\nWestern Fells, volume 7 of the Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells\n(1966). With an area of high pressure providing excellent weather\nfor the week, we were in for a treat\n\u2013 yes, whilst London was in fog,\nwe had blue skies. Our aim for the\nweek: to scale some of England\u2019s\nhighest peaks.\nSunday\nOur first day\u2019s walk explored our\nsurroundings, the Screes. Leaving\nthe barn by 9, we walked through\nLatterbarrow forest up onto Irton Fell (395m). Many tried their\nbest to jump in the bogs but none\nsurpassed Thubeena\u2019s efforts (al-though I came close). Rising up\nto Whin Rigg (535m) above the\nScrees we were blessed with some\nsunshine which had found its way\nthrough the mist, and breathtaking views down to the dark waters\nof Wastwater 450m below. Our final\nascent was up to Illgill Head (609m)\nwhere we sat in sunshine for lunch.\nThe entire rainfall for the week (just\na few spots) fell as we descended\ndown Straighthead Gill, successfully fording the streams swollen from\nthe previous week\u2019s washout.\nAfter pausing to observe a rainbow rising from the lake, we ambled\nto the valley floor, and made a quick\ntrip to the Wasdale Head Inn for a\nnice (brewed on site) pint. It turned\nout to be not quick enough as dusk\nfell whilst we negotiated the lakeside path beneath the Screes on the\nway home.\nDespite the darkness, spirits\nwere high whilst crossing the boulder field before finally reaching the\nhead of the lake. Back at the barn\nwe enjoyed our now legendary West\nAfrican stew (the one with the peanut butter) and got in the festive\nspirit with Christmas pudding and\nbrandy butter!\nMonday\nAfter the usual faff \u2013 AKA difficulty\nin emerging from nice warm sleeping bags \u2013 we set off in the bright\nsunshine across the fields of Ashness How to scale Middle Fell\n(592m).\nThe ascent from Greendale was\nmarvellous with the blue-sky sunshine peaking over the Screes conquered the previous day. Somehow\nit was warm enough for shorts and\nt-shirt \u2013 crazy! Must be this global\nwarming thing. After many false\nsummits, the real one provided that\nall important \u2018wow-factor\u2019 (supple-mented with biscuits) with excellent visibility.\nSadly Thubeena had a ligament\ninjury, so we changed from the\nplanned route (up onto Seatallan\nand down via Buckbarrow); after\ndescending north to the col, we\nclambered over rocks round to\nGreendale tarn for lunch.\nThe weather was having a good\neffect on Shweta who, after previously exclaiming she was \u201cmore of\na TV person\u201d, was now becoming\n\u201cat one with nature\u201d! It surely was\na beautiful spot for enjoying the\nserenity on the fells. We contoured\nround above Greendale Gill back\ndown to the valley.\nIt was to be the last day for Aanchal, Thubeena, Shweta and Dharani, who were taking a train at 5 from\nthe coast, so we piled in the minibus\nto go and enjoy a fantastic sunset\nover the sea at Drigg. Back at the\nbarn we cooked and demolished an\nexcellent apple and leek casserole\nbefore heading out under hundreds\nof stars and the visible Milky Way to\nthe local Strands pub.\nGiven our village seemed to have\nall of 10 houses in it, we were somewhat surprised by the provision of\ntwo inns, opposite one another. But\nwe weren\u2019t complaining!\nTuesday\nA pre-7am alarm signalled the start\nof a tougher climb; sights were\nset on Great Gable (899m), the pyramidal mountain framing our val-ley. According to Wainwright, our\nproposed ascent via the ominous-sounding Little Hell Gate scree\nbetween the Napes was the most\nstrenuous route.\nTreading the Moses\u2019 Trod path\neast from Wasdale Head we soon\nrose from the valley floor up Gavel\nNeese, all the while battling to rise\nfaster than the swirling mist. But\nfrom 450m the \u201cJekyll became a\nmonstrous Hyde\u201d up whose torrent\nof stones we \u201cforced our limbs\u201d,\naiming at a cairn \u201cfifty swear-words\nhigher\u201d.\nIn reality it wasn\u2019t quite as severe\nas Wainwright described, but with\nicy patches it did get quite technical.\nThe scramble up the frozen slopes\nbrought us above the mist, allowing\nus to view the previous walks\u2019 summits poking above the cloud.\nAfter contouring the base of White\nNapestheascentupthescree-shoot\ngulley began. We soon found ourselves past the snow line (~780m)\nstanding atop the rocky tower of\nWhite Napes, surveying a most exceptional view up the valley.\nWe were duly rewarded for our\nearly morning efforts. Sadly for us\nthe mist did finally engulf us whilst\nscrambling to the snow-covered\nsummit. Given the icy conditions\nwe were glad of a simple descent\nvia the tourist path to Sty Head.\nLunch was taken with a view up to\nSeathwaite, the Watendlath Fells\nand the Helvellyn ranges beyond.\nWith Mark\u2019s ankle playing up\na little, we took the gradually descending path over Toad How back\ndown to Wasdale Head for 2pm.

This is going to\nbe a bit of a non-column as nothing\nreally happens over the Christmas\nperiod so I\u2019ll just share my thoughts\non a few unrelated topics.\n2006 is now behind us but I would\nlike to give you all a piece of advice\nin light of a diabolical night out I had\nrecently. If someone ever offers to\nentertain you in Stirling, politely de-cline. I had the misfortune of enduring an evening there and I wouldn\u2019t\nwant any of you to be put through\nthe same ordeal. Basically, nightlife\nin Stirling is just shit.

In short,\ngive it a miss.\nOn that note it is nice to be back\nat Imperial but every good thing\ncomes with a downside, sort of\nlike 21st birthdays for boys. Initially they are pleased that they are\n\u201ccoming of age\u201d but at the same\ntime disappointed that their willies\naren\u2019t going to get any bigger. My\ncomplaint is related to a topic that\nhas become clich\u00e9 but what is with\nsome of the students here? Not that\nI am wanting Felix to start another\n\u201chate campaign\u201d in the fashion of\nlast year\u2019s editor but the argument\nneeds to be re-stated, if only for the\nbenefit of the freshers. It is not the\nmajority who are unnecessarily\ngeeky but there really is a hardcore\nwho seem to be hell bent on destroying what is left of Imperial\u2019s\nsocial reputation by devoting large\nsections of their free time to online\ngaming. I overheard a conversation\nthe other day (between two individuals who were clearly whipped\nup into some pre-orgasmic frenzy\nover the release of\u2026.. wait for it\u2026.\nAN EXPANSION PACK FOR AN\nONLINE COMPUTER GAME!\n(You know the type of person I am\nreferring to, greasy hair, strange\nbody odour and the woeful dress\nsense that suggests their idea of a\nsex life is an empty Pringles tube\nthat has been filled with pigs liver\nand given 5 minutes on full power.)\nI mean come on guys, a computer\ngame? Getting excited over one is\nall very well and good, if you are 13.\nBreak free from your self-imposed\nelectronic shackles and do something a bit less anti-social. Im not\nhaving a go at all computer games,\nsome are quite good fun for about\nan hour or so but I really don\u2019t see\nhow some people can spend days\nand weeks living live in a \u201cvirtual\nworld\u201d and only talking to faceless\n\u201conline friends.\u201d Having experimented with internet games my\nphilosophy on the subject is as fol-lows. I see online gaming as being\nsort of an electronic equivalent to\nthe Special Olympics as even if you\nwin you are still \u201cSpecial.\u201d If you are\nunable to stop totally, at least make\nan attempt to ration yourself.\nMoving on, unlike columnists\nin the \u201cproper\u201d newspapers I\u2019ve\nowned up to the fact that I don\u2019t really have that much to say at the\nminute. But what would a new years\ncolumn be without some predictions for 2007. Predicting the future\nis a mugs game. If I get it right, I\u2019ll\nbe a smug \u201cI told you so\u201d arsehole\nand if I get things wrong I\u2019ll look\nstupid so I\u2019ll try and just stick to the\nmore unlikely thoughts I have had\nfor the year ahead. Here goes.\nWorld Peace!\nFollowing mass protests outside\nparliament by all the major churches at the extension of homosexual\nrights, a new solution will be proposed to solve sectarian conflicts\nfrom Belfast to Baghdad. It was\ntouching seeing how distaste for\nthe gays has the power to unite\nhardline Protestants, Catholics,\nMuslims and Jews who would otherwise be irreconcilable so lets just\nre-route some Gay Pride marches\nthrough the worlds sectarian trou-Stephen Brown\nComment Editor\n\u201cTheir idea of\na sex life is an\nempty Pringles\ntube that has\nbeen filled with\npigs liver and\ngiven 5 minutes\non full power\u201d\nblespots. Withdraw the soldiers and\nsend in the gays. Problem solved.\nRevolution!\nCloser to home, a victory for the\nextreme left sees Student Respect\ncandidates sweep the board in the\nICU sabbatical elections. Students\nreturn in October to find that Monopoly has been banned on campus on the grounds that the game\nis part of a capitalist conspiracy\nto brainwash young people. Also,\nthose attending freshers fayre will\nfind themselves conscripted into\nthe newly formed ICU Revolutionary Guard as our Union is now at\nwar with the state of Texas.\nNew Rector announced!\nJeremy Clarkson is appointed as\nthe new Rector. College grinds to a\nhalt as Greenpeace mount a sit in\nprotest in the faculty building.\nBig Brother Shock!\nSaddam\u2019s execution has turned\nout to be pure fabrication. He is\ncurrently being held at a secret\nlocation by Channel 4 and will suddenly appear in the Celebrity Big\nBrother house within the next few\nweeks. This will in turn provoke\ninternational outrage from human\nrights organisations. They will protest that no human being deserves\nto be imprisoned in an enclosed\nspace with Jade Goody and family,\nhowever evil their crimes.\nAnyway, that\u2019s me finished now.\nAnd I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be\nable to fill half a page with whatever\ncrap came into my head.\nAn irreverent take on the past, present and future from our estwhile and outspoken Comment Editor\nA delightful letter to the Editor\nThere are\ngood bands\nat Imperial,\napparently\nDear Sir,\nI am writing to proverbially take\noff my glove and slap James Millen around the face and state that I\ndemand satisfaction in response to\nhis comments about the Jazz and\nRock Society in fem last week. In\nhis article he says \u201cFuture Corpses, Imperial\u2019s only decent band\n(you heard me Jazz&Rock, what\nya gonna do about it eh?).\u201d. In reaction to the first part, I think that\nFuture Corpses are great, they are\nhauntingly original and great to\nwatch live, if only because of the\nsex faces that Matty makes whilst\nplaying the drums, but there are\nplenty of decent bands at Imperial. Take White Elephant, they\nplay some damn fine Blues-Rock\ncovers, 40 Acres,Telemark, Freddy\nFreeloader, Reality Cheques, Luca\nLaraia, alumni What The Funk,\nEmberDaze, Cielo Azul and Carlos\n\u201cThe One Man Band\u201d Keery-Fisher\n(although I had better not mention\nImperial\u2019s longest running, and officially most dangerous band DonkeyBox because I am an ex-mem-ber). And for completeness I think\na certain \u2018royal\u2019 band could be men-tioned... I think the \u2018what makes a\ngreat band\u2019 argument has too many\nopinionated facets to be deemed an\nargument, if a band puts on a good\nshow then that is good enough for\nme, it doesn\u2019t matter what style of\nmusic they are. There seems to be\nan epidemic in the number of obnoxious alternative music snobs,\nwho feel that unless the band is\nso unbelievably unheard of then it\nis nothing but aural diarrhoea. My\npersonal opinion is that this is a\nvery pretentious view, particularly\nbecause indy is really the current\n\u2018pop\u2019, and a lot of indy bands sound\nlike they really want to play rock,\nbut they also want to please their\nindy-loving chums, and so buy telecasters and rarely take their amps\nabove 3, let alone 11. I do like The\nKillers though.\nThe Jazz and Rock society is for\nlovers and purveyors of live mu-sic, whatever the genre. We have\na practise room, which may I add\nis frequented by Future Corpses,\nand we host gig and jam night that\nFuture Corpses have played at, so\nwouldn\u2019t that make them a Jazz and\nRock band? Admittedly we aren\u2019t as\nalternative as AMS, a lot of the time\nthe only two song\u2019s played at jam\nnights are Master of Puppets and\nHey Joe, but we like, we may be\nmaking tits of ourselves on-stage,\nbut it\u2019s all in the name of fun.\nAs for what are Jazz and Rock going to do, well James Millen, I challenge you to a Rock-Off.\nAaron Oliver-Taylor\nJazz & Rock Chairman\nAndy Sykes replies,\nAaron, my dear friend, I am in said\nband (Future Corpses). How do\nyou expect me to reply?\nI\u2019m a little offended at your rather blas\u00e9 dismissal of telecasters.\nEat your words, sir, for they\u2019ve\nproven to be a far more worthwhile\nguitar than the iconic stratocaster\n(just have a look at the varieties of\ntele available). Incidentally, I play\na tele, you insensitive clod.\nHowever, I\u2019m going to be a little serious, and say that it\u2019s a bit\ndisappointing that out of all the\n11,000 or so students we have here,\nwe have very few bands, and even\nfewer decent ones. Covers are fine\nand dandy, and fun to play, but it\u2019s\nall a little worthless. Surely you\u2019d\nmuch rather go and see a band\nplay their own, original, new stuff\nthan simply covering a Led Zep\nsong (as I\u2019ve unfortunately witnessed far too many times in my\nmany years in Jazz & Rock).\nIt\u2019s not about snobbery; it\u2019s about\nbeing creative and so and so forth.\nIn fact, the snobs tend to make the\nworst music and worst bands. Most\nof the great bands I\u2019ve met have\nbeen very open-minded, friendly\nfolk - it\u2019s an attitude thing.\nWe are, of course, very grateful\nfor the use of the practice room.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so shocking there\nare so few good bands, when you\ncan practice in a decent room with\na decent (if horribly bashed up)\ndrum kit for what amounts to a\npittance.\nGood luck finding anywhere else\nin London to practice at that price;\nI know, I\u2019ve tried.\nI\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re challenging Mr Millen to, as you put it, a\n\u201crock-off\u201d. Surely you should challenge us?\nWant to get something\noff your chest?\nWrite to:\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nomment&\nOpinion\n5\nfelix\nFriday 12 January 2007\nC\n\n"

    "content": "I, Gamer\nY\nou wait ages for\nImperial College\nto get some games\ncoverage, and then\neverything turns\nup at once. It\u2019s 2007, everyone,\nand devious plans are afoot in\nthe basements of the Student\nUnion.\nHopefully everyone had enjoyable holidays and spent\nplenty of time queuing outside\nVirgin for Wii consoles, harassing the managers at various\nbranches of Game, and generally trying to find one of the\nbastard things that seem to be\neverywhere except the stores\nyou were visiting.\nBut if you\u2019ve entered the New\nYear empty handed, don\u2019t fear -Felix is arranging a few events\nthat should spur on some enthusiasm for the older games\nin your collection, and we start\nthis week with coverage of a\nrather health-endangering\nplaythrough of Deus Ex.\nMore importantly, though, is\na new society that\u2019s finding its\nfeet this year. First Stoic TV\nopened Games Watch, then\nFelix relaunched a Games Section. Now Imperial College has\na Games Society, and this term\nwill see the first events by the\nclub including LAN get-togeth-ers and more.\nWe\u2019ll be covering the society\nin the future, but if you want to\nget in touch now, you can contact Nimalen, one of the society\nfounders, for more information,\nor to tell him what you hope to\nsee \u2013 nb604@imperial.ac.uk\nWe\u2019ve also made a few changes in the section here, shafting\nthe Out Now column in favour\nof a far sexier and informative\nnews page. And we\u2019ve axed the\ncute little quote on the bottom\nof the last page, as well as other plans for the future. Like the\nchanges? Hate the changes?\nGet in touch with us.\nWhatever way you look at it,\nchange is on the cards in 2007.\nHuge leaps forward are ap-proaching, not least in the console stakes with the European\nrelease of the PS3, but also\nwith some of the most technologically impressive releases\nfor the PC in some time.\nIt\u2019s all to come, and Felix\nhopes to be covering it all. Don\u2019t\nbe deceived by the usual January slump \u2013 this year is going\nto be huge.\nCongratulations to Philip\nClemow, Patrick Willis, Sam\nTournoff and George Khouri\nwho all bagged prizes in our\nChristmas giveaway.\nMichael Cook\nGames Editor\n15\nfelix\nFriday 12 January 2007\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis week in videogames\nI\nt\u2019s been a busy Christmas period for anyone stocking, or\nhoping to buy, a Nintendo Wii.\nStories of queueing in the wee\nsmall hours (pun more-or-less intended) for the consoles and\npaying ridiculous prices weren\u2019t restricted to America, as high-street\nretailers, unable to confirm their\ndelivery dates for the revolutionary console, faced queues outside\nshops long before opening hours,\nand non-stop phone querying from\nanxious customers. Reports of various store employees purchasing\nearly deliveries and selling them on\nat nearly double the price were disappointingly common.\nAs this Felix goes to press, the latest figures suggest that ten million\n360s have been sold since launch,\ngiving Microsoft a chance to launch\nmore news on IPTV, the 360\u2019s first\nmove into multimedia manage-ment. News has also been leaked\nregarding an upgraded version\nof the 360, thought to be released\nsometime in 2007. The \u2018Zephyr\u2019, as\nit\u2019s currently known, will run with\nless noise and less heat, as well as\nboasting HDMI ports and a rather\nlarge 120Gb hard drive.\nSony meanwhile remain confident of their success. The PlayStation3 has sold over a million units\nworldwide, making it a faster-sell-ing console than its predecessor\nwas at this point. Despite setbacks\nin distribution, the previous market\nleaders are still hoping to have six\nmillion units in place by April.\nBut despite all of this, it was a\ngood yuletide for gamers. Nintendo\nshifted every single one of their\nhundreds of thousands of consoles,\nand DS sales soared in line with\nthis, allowing the handheld giant to\nup production to the rate of four per\nsecond. Even with various tales of\ninjury and TV breaking, and a costly\nrecall of many Wii controllers, there\nare a lot of happy Zelda players out\nthere, and even happier accountants for Nintendo.\nSo with Microsoft claiming to\nhave sold half a million 360s over\nChristmas alone, and Nintendo\u2019s\nsuccess quite plain to see, it might\nsurprised gamers to know that a recent report suggests that the PlayStation3 will have a market lead,\nwith seventy-five million consoles\nworldwide, by 2010.\nThe market analysis group Research and Markets claim that\nthe last-gen market share, way in\nexcess of 50%, combined with rumours of a successor to the PSP\n,\nmean that Sony are likely to end up\ndominating for the next few years\nat least. Whether you see that as\ngood news for market balancing,\nor bad news for innovation, it does\nseem likely that the sheer scale of\nPS2 ownership has bought Sony another chance at gaming.\nBetter news than a massive business being given a chance at gam-ing, however, is the idea that gamers themselves might get a chance.\nThis week, the Minister for Creative\nIndustries called for the gaming\nWii problems, tall stories and Wrighty looking odd. Same story, different year?\nindustry to sponsor an \u2018academy\u2019\nthat would teach and encourage the\nnext generation of games design-ers, programmers and artists. Citing the London Film School as an\nexample from another media, MP\nShaun Woodward says that there\u2019s\na sense of \u201ccatch-up\u201d for the indus-try, and that it might help push forward talent that would otherwise\nbe ignored by mainstream schools.\nThe British press, in a brilliant display of tact, termed them \u201cschools\nfor Geeks\u201d. Well, quite.\nReleases this week include Wario\nWare for the lucky Wii owners, as\nwell as Lost Planet for the Xbox 360.\nHowever, if the release schedule for\nthe next few months looks bleak to\nyou (and if it does, you\u2019re not alone)\nthen it\u2019s worth looking around online for the tail end of the January\nsale. Trauma Center: Under The\nKnife on the DS can be nabbed for\nless than \u00a310 at Tesco.com, Splinter\nCell: Double Agent and the Dawn\nOf War Anthology are both half\nprice on Play.com, and Company\nOf Heroes (Limited Edition) is \u00a318\npurchased online through Game.\nSearching around will reveal a lot\nof good deals that are likely to go on\nuntil the end of January.\nThe best money-sapper we\u2019ve\ncome across this week, though, has\nto be the posture-support pillow\nrelease for gamers who use handheld consoles. A Japanese com-pany, Lofty, have designed a pillow\nshaped like a big padded vest, that\ngamers can hug in front of them to\nprevent back pain. Ingenious.\nAs a contrast, America got the President of Nintendo America at their launch. We got a tit in a golf suit\nIt looked like a lot at launch, but it wasn\u2019t. Now the race is on for the factories to get consoles on the shelves before consumers lose interest\n\n"

    "content": "20\n10\nFashion\nOn top of the Lake District\nOddness\nClubs and Societies\nNo confidence in sabb\nThe student newspaper\nof Imperial College\nNo. 1,368 \u2022 Friday \u2022\n12 January 2007 \u2022\nfelixonline.co.uk\nfelix\nfelix\nAndy Sykes\nEditor-in-chief\npage\npage\nGuardian Student Newspaper of the Year\nA no confidence motion may be submitted against the Deputy President (Graduate Students) next week\nFelix has learnt that a no confidence\nmotion is likely to be submitted\nagainst Shama Rahman, Deputy\nPresident (Graduate Students), alleging that the sabb has misled Union Council, failed to work the hours\nrequired by her contract among\nother failings, and that her position\n\u201chas become untenable\u201d.\nFelix has obtained a leaked copy of\nthe draft paper, complete with high-lights, that shows that almost all of\nthe Union\u2019s Executive Committee\n(excluding the sabbs themselves)\nhave seconded the motion, including all of the Faculty Union Presidents, a number of CSCs and other\nsenior Union officers. The Executive Committee is the second most\nimportant body in the Union, and is\nsuperseded only by the Council.\nThe document obtained by this\nreporter is 34 pages long, and\ncontains numerous allegations of\nmisconduct, incompetence, and\nbreaches of Union regulations.\nThe paper was written by Jon Matthews, Deputy President (Finance\n& Services).\nShould the motion succeed, Ms\nRahman will be suspended on full\npay for one month, then dismissed\nwith a severance package of another month\u2019s pay.\nThe allegations presented in the\npaper are backed up with a substantial appendix, and total more\nthan 40 individual points. For exam-ple, the paper claims Ms Rahman\nhas only managed to get in at 10am\nthree times during her term so far,\nand occasionally arriving as late as\n1.30pm; sabbs are required by contract to keep office hours of 10am\nto 4pm. This has been observed by\nseveral sources in the Union and\nthis reporter. She has also missed\nat least one meeting with high-level\nCollege officials, and missed more\nthan four Management & Planning\nGroup meetings, which are between\nUnion staff and the sabbs to discuss\nconfidential issues and strategy.\nMore serious are the allegations\nmade about her failure to handle\nthe welfare issues of PhD students\nthat had approached her; these\ncases had to be handled by other\nsabbs. It also describes her lack of\nunderstanding of the issues facing\nthe various types of postgraduates,\nsuch as PhD students, taught mas-tersstudents,andresearchmasters\nstudents. In one case, documented\nby emails that were copied to Mr\nMatthews by the student in ques-tion, a query by a student about the\nnumber of hours a week a non-EU\nPhD student could legally work remained unanswered for a month\nbefore a staff member raised it with\nMr Matthews.\nThere are also numerous allegations of lying to or misleading either\nher colleagues or Council, backed\nup with documentation. Felix has\nseen emails, provided by an anonymous source, that suggest Ms Rahman may have \u2018pulled a sickie\u2019 in\norder to take Friday off. This email\nwas sent only ten days after the\nPresident, John Collins, sent Ms\nRahman a written formal warning\nconcerning her attendance and office hours, among other things.\nMiss Rahman is also accused of\nbadly handling the budget for the\nGSA Christmas Ball, initially saying she had secured more than\n\u00a32000 from a senior College figure.\nMr Matthews signed off on the\nbudget in good faith; however, it\ntranspired that the staff member\nhad not promised the money, and\nthe event was cancelled and hastily rescheduled by the sabbs after\nit became clear it would make a\nsubstantial loss even if attendance\nexceeded expectation. Ms Rahman,\nwhen questioned, said that she was\nobtaining written evidence from\nthe staff member in question that\nshows the money was promised\nthen rescinded. The organisation of\nthe \u201c3 Colleges\u201d night is also criti-cised, accusing her of leaving the\ntakings in an insecure location for\na week, paying the bands directly\nfrom the takings (forbidden under\nUnion rules), not keeping adequate\ntrack of the attendance, and selling\ntickets on credit without authorisation (also forbidden under Union\nrules).\nThe paper describes how she\ntold Council she could not attend\nQUARC (an important College\nmeeting for discussing education\nquality issues) on 8 December because she was too busy rearranging the venue for the Ball. However,\nthis reporter has seen an invoice\nfor payment from the new venue,\nwhich was signed off by a senior\nUnion staff member on the 6 December, confirming the new venue.\nMs Rahman says that she was still\nconfirming other details to do with\nthe venue change, and that a second invoice exists which shows that\nshe had changed the booking.\nShe is also accused of misleading\nCouncil over a visit to Clayponds.\nShe claims she went personally;\nhowever, the paper contains an\nemail from the warden at Clayponds that describes his dissatisfaction with a late-notice cancellation by Ms. Rahman, and her choice\nof replacement.\nThere are many other accusations relating to the points above,\nand it is not yet clear how much\nwill make it to the final report. Ms\nRahman was contacted by Felix to\nprovide comment: \u201cIn my defence,\nI had a steep learning curve as I\nwasn\u2019t given sufficient training and\nunder pressured circumstances\ngiven the poor handover. I wanted\nto do it right, so followed often misleading or incomplete advice from\nthe team, especially Jon. I didn\u2019t\nreceive much in the way of support\nand guidance, and didn\u2019t get forewarned about some of the pitfalls. I\nalways had to prise information out\nof an unhelpful and dismissive man.\nThis in addition to my own and my\nfather\u2019s health problems, which the\nPresident knew about, causing me\nlots of stress. I\u2018m still weighing my\ndecision as to what to do next.\u201d\nIt is likely the motion, if submit-ted, will be referred to the newly inaugurated Union Court to discuss\nthe evidence, before being passed\nback to Council. Shama Rahman, Deputy President (Graduate Students)\n16\npage\n\n"

    "content": "Kasabian review, yes, music is dead\nJust one review this week due to mince pies filling up reviewers\u2019 inner ears and seeking medical attention\nAs I sat there, miles away from the\nfour dots jumping around the stage\nat Earl\u2019s Court, immersed by the\nspooky lighting effects and almost\nmasked by the hundreds of jump-ing, hyperactive fans in the crowd,\nI kept asking myself one question over and over again: why, in\nthe name of L.S.F., wasn\u2019t I at the\nfront?\nProbably due to me being slow off\nthe mark (for once); I got into Kasabian far too late, and one day in the\nvast summer break that us fresh-ers ploughed our way through I\ndecided to download more than just\nthe ubiquitous Club Foot. Pretty\ndecent, I thought, so after searching for gig tickets online I discov-ered, to my dismay, there were only\nseating ones left. Imagining the\nmosh pit that would no doubt ensue\nwhen said track was played, I was,\nit would be safe to say, fairly pissed\noff with myself for being so slow.\nStill, I went along to the gig, no\ndoubt Kasabian\u2019s largest gig to\ndate, and I was quite impressed, but\ncouldn\u2019t help feeling so detached,\nso removed from it all. I was so far\nback it was uncomfortably surreal;\nupon trying to stand up and jump up\nand down to the thundering opener\nShoot The Runner I realized that\nnot only was everyone else in the\nrear upper tiers (sigh) sitting down,\nbut if I tried to jump I would no\ndoubt topple and cascade down the\nseating area until I landed, most\nlikely fatally, in the standing area.\nPerforming their entire second\nalbum, seemingly all revolving\naround colonial-era Britain, and\nmost of their debut, self-titled al-bum, the gig moved along well and\nthere was certainly no let down in\nthe pace, apart from the acoustic\nBritish Legion, with quite calming\nlyrics that even the most frantic\nmoshers felt the urge to stop cracking their heads open for a second\nand wave their arms in-sync with\neveryone else.\nAll the tracks played were far-more heavy on the bass and drums\nthan could be heard in the LP ver-sions, and all the better for it: Kasabian\u2019s musical appeal lies in the\npacy, drummer-driven songs such\nas Empire and Cutt Off that you\ncan just simply jump up and down\nto, and with a more pronounced\nrhythm section live this encour-aged, if only for brief periods, people in the seating areas to actually\nstand up and attempt to dance.\nThe sounds of Oasis, particularly through the vocals of both\nlead guitarist Sergio Pizzorno and\nlead vocalist Tom Meighan, shone\nthrough on tracks such as Me Plus\nOne and Last Trip, but this was by\nno means a negative aspect of the\nperformance: it suits the musical\nstyle of Kasabian perfectly. Unlike\nEmbrace, who in my opinion are living in Coldplay\u2019s shadow, Kasabian,\nalthough sounding very similar to\nOasis, are their own band entirely.\nNevertheless, this was hardly\nthe perfect gig: a few of the tracks\nsounded a bit weak, particularly\nthe single Empire, which was very\ndisappointing considering how brilliant that track is to sing along and\nleap around to: the usually-superb\nguitar playing of Pizzorno fell flat\nhere, sadly. Still, tracks such as The\nDoberman, the over-the-top album\ncloser, more than made up for it\nwith the trumpeter blasting it out.\nFinishing with both Club Foot and\nL.S.F., the mosh-pitters went into\noverdrive and to be honest I could\nnot imagine in the slightest how\npeople would jump up and down\n(and into each other) during L.S.F.\n\u2013 until I came to Earl\u2019s Court, that\nis. From where I was seated (sigh)\nit looked incredible and I wished\nwholeheartedly I was a part of that.\nLeaving the gig to the seemingly\ninfinite chants of the closing song,\nI was undecided as to how much I\nenjoyed the gig. Reminding myself\nthat I was desperate to leap from\nwhere I was into the standing area\njust to be part of the gig rather than\nbe unusually detached, I concluded\nthis must be saying something extremely positive of Kasabian\u2019s infective musical stylings. To all the\nKasabian wannabies out there, I\nthink Meighan sums their future\nup best during the performance\nof The Doberman: \u201cWatch them\ndisappear.\u201d\nRobin Andrews\nlive review\nKasabian\nEarl\u2019s Court\n14 Friday 12 January 2007\neviews\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfelix\nR\n\n"

    "content": "had also inadvertently caused the\ndeaths of several government soldiers when he decided to test the\nfriendly-fire settings on his proximity mines. And it was about to earn\nhim a few rockets to the chest, unless I acted fast.\nThere are good points and bad\npoints to playing a game non-stop\nfrom start to finish. Firstly \u2013 you\nappreciate the design as a whole a\nlot more. This may sound odd \u2013 after all, I barely did any sidequests\nand certainly didn\u2019t pause for the\nscenery. But you see the shape\nof the game. You see what it does\nwell, what it does too much, you see\nmuch more of what the game really\nis.\nYou also begin to drop out of character slightly. Whilst I remember\nfondly my chisel-jawed, no-kills run\nthrough Deus Ex, any delusions of\nbeing the strong, moody saviour\nwere thrown out of the window this\ntime as I ran, screaming, through\nthe Parisian catacombs after being caught unawares by a Greasel.\nIt was dark, I was tired. It had to\nhappen.\nS\no, it was one a.m. and I\u2019d\nclearly made a cocky mis-take, as inebriated federal\nagents are prone to do.\nQuickloading is a familiar\naction to the Endurance gamer, but\nnow was not the time. I took a deep\nbreath as my foe scanned me for\nthreats, and made my decision.\nI pegged it.\nThings were beginning to blur\n\u2013 guards and soldiers were reduced\nto moving obstacles, and it all became a bit like an extravagantly-textured game of Pong. With all of\nmy upgrades, gleaned through, ooh,\nminutes of lockpicking and stealth,\nI was able to run, leap and dodge at\nan utterly inhuman speed.\nThere\u2019s something ridiculously\nrewarding about the whole affair.\nSleep deprivation occasionally\ngives you bursts of strange, painful\nhappiness anyway, but deciding to\nindulge in the gamer stereotype, to\nplay a game for so long that it hurts\na little \u2013 it feels like a nerdy episode\nof Jackass, but with occasional giggling and caffeine overdosing.\nTwo hours (and a bit) later, and\nNo-one could blame Gunther for becoming a merciless killing machine of international conspirators. He really didn\u2019t want Lemon-Lime\nit was all wrapped up. Only a few\nhad joined in (see \u201cThings To Do\nIn NYC When You\u2019re Augmented\u201d,\nbelow for notes on one adventure)\nbut it had been a rewarding seven\nhours \u2013 or twelve, if you were one of\nthe very dedicated.\nIt\u2019s something they want to do\nagain \u2013 albeit with a different game\n\u2013 and I can\u2019t blame them. It\u2019s an entirely different way to experience\na game like that. It doesn\u2019t suit all\ngames or gamers, but Deus Ex fits\nthe bill of all-night gaming perfect-ly. Area 51 will never be the same\nagain.\nThe story doesn\u2019t quite end there,\nof course. The Endurance Gamers\nare off on another all-nighter this\nJanuary, with Hitman: Blood Money as their next target.\nStarting in the evening of January 20th, they\u2019ll be playing through\nall of the assassinate-em-up in the\nstyle of various movie assassins\nThings to do in NYC when you\u2019re augmented\nJim was his name, at least online\nanyways. Deus Ex on regular was a\ngame for sissies. Playing it through\nin eight hours was the kind of thing\nhe was doing when we were all\nlearning to understand how to move\nin Pong. For Jim, Endurance meant\nnothing unless it was the real deal.\nAnd so he started four hours before us, on Realistic difficulty, and\nplayed for twelve hours.\nThat\u2019s longer than I spend awake\non most weekend days. Below are\nsome choice excerpts from his\nnotes. To read the whole story, point\nyour web browser at http://tinyurl.\ncom/tgyeo.\nOkay, this is it - all my tracks have\nbeen chucked into WMP and the\nshuffle button has been pressed.\nHERE GOES NOTHING.\n4:30 - Realistic difficulty, yes.

    "content": "No replicas here, we\u2019re the real\ndeal (unlike those airsoft folk you\nread about last term). Imperial College Rifle & Pistol Club\u2019s got off to\na flying start this year with high\nturnout and interest for both our\nrifle and air pistol shooting over at\nMoorgate on Wednesdays and also\nour fortnightly Clay Pigeon shooting trips.\nOver the summer Sam Dash\n(former President) flew all the way\nback from NYC to compete at the\nannual Imperial Meeting and last\nFebruary our Clay Pigeon teams\ncame in 8th at the annual BUSA\nChampionships.\nBefore anyone asks, yes, the guns\nare real and yes, they could potentially hurt you but rest assured all of\nour activities are conducted under\nwatchful eyes and observe strict\nsafety guidelines whether you\u2019re a\nbeginner or an experienced marks-man. If you want to make it a regular pastime or if you just want to try\nit out and see how it goes, we\u2019d love\nto hear from you!\nAs a rough guideline a Clay Pigeon trip will cost around \u00a320 all in\nand Wednesdays can be as cheap or\nexpensive as you want to make it\n\u2013 you pay as much as you shoot.\nFor more information, times and\ncosts, Dave (Club Captain) and\nAyman (Clay Captain) can be\nfound at icrpc@imperial.ac.uk.\nImperial College Railway Society\nis a bit of a dinosaur. Our society\nperhaps represents the geekiest\npastime at college, and perhaps\nthe most misrepresented. None\nof the current committee (as far\nas I know) stands at the ends of\nstation platforms taking pictures\nand writing down numbers in little\nnotebooks. Even if they did, railway\nenthusiasts are not anorak-wearing\nneanderthals \u2013 most trainspotters\nthese days note down their train\nnumbers on Blackberries and have\nstate-of-the-art digital cameras!\nAfter 25 years of dormancy, we\nresurrected the dinosaur two years\nago in a Jurassic Park-like exercise\nwith the support of staff and alum-ni. Without your support, however,\nthe dinosaur could become extinct\nonce again. The interest from staff\nand alumni remains strong, but unbelievably students are shunning\nthe opportunity to find out about\nBritain\u2019s public transport heritage.\nWith our lectures and visits to company depots, we could offer valuable networking opportunities!\nOne of the most popular activities we have carried out is a series\nof trips to volunteer on the Welsh\nHighland Railway (WHR). It\u2019s\nmessy, hard work but this is amply\nrewarded by the warm fuzzy feeling\nof helping to reopen a railway that\nhas been closed for about 70 years.\nIn addition the hard work takes\nplace in the inspirational setting of\nSnowdonia. Our links with the WHR\nhave grown this term with a talk by\nJohn Sreeves on the reconstruction\nof bridges along the route. Given at\na rather technical level some of the\ndetails in the talk were beyond me,\nbut it goes to show that we do more\nthan just drool over steam trains!\nWe visited Chiltern Railways depot at Aylesbury on the afternoon\nof Wednesday 6th December. The\ninteresting itinerary included a\nchance to ride on the driver-train-ing simulator operated by Chiltern.\nThis was a great opportunity to\nlearn a bit more about the operation\nof a modern railway and to have a\ngo at driving a (simulated) train!\nThis term we\u2019ll have more talks\nand trips, including a private visit to\nthe London Transport Museum Depot at Acton, our annual dinner and\na talk on railway safety. Contact us\nat icrs@imperial.ac.uk if you want\nto be put on our mailing list, and\nwe\u2019ll keep you informed of upcoming events.\nFull steam ahead\nAltogether now... He\u2019s behind you! Clay pigeon shooting at the BUSA\nChampionship. Left, Rupert using a Silver Pigeon. Right, Tristan\nwith his vintage semi-automatic.\nAyman Sleiman\nICwakeboarding\u2019s first event of\nthe year, the Beach Party, was a\nmassive success. The Beach Party\nisn\u2019t the only event that the club has\norganised so far this year; there has\nalso been a fantastic Halloweenthemed free beer night and most\nrecently the club\u2019s first-ever tour.\nSeven lucky riders ventured out of\nLondon to Northampton for a weekend of both boat and cable riding.\nThe venue for Saturday\u2019s riding\nwas Grendon lakes, where the club\nhad booked a boat (a Mastercraft\nX2) for the whole day, with each\nrider getting three twenty minute\nsets. This may not seem like a long\ntime to be riding, but I can assure\nyou that wakeboarding behind a\nboat for twenty minutes is very\nhard work. Fresher Dave, the first\non the water, adapted very quickly\nto the huge wake and was soon flying across it in style. Also on the\nwater in the morning session were\ncommittee members Sam and Jen.\nParticular congratulations to Jen\nwho had never wakeboarded behind a boat before yet still managed\nto stand up first time.\nThe afternoon session saw Jenny,\nDarko, Will and John (a.k.a. Kermit) hit the water. All were very\nimpressive, despite Darko and the\nboat engaging in a tug-of-war which\nhe inevitably lost. Jenny managed\na wake to wake with ease and laid\ndown a stylish surface 360. John\nalso succeeded in going big over\nthe wake and was desperately close\nto pulling a wake to wake 360. Considerable kudos also goes to Will\nwho inverted his ride by attempting\nsome backrolls over the wake.\nSunday saw us hitting one of the\nUK\u2019s premier wakeboarding loca-tions, WakeMK in Milton Keynes.\nThis was more familiar territory for\nthe club\u2019s riders as we were back\nbehind a cable. WakeMK is home\nto pretty much the finest selection\nof obstacles (kickers and sliders) in\nthe UK. A kicker is a ramp which\nriders can use to launch themselves high into the air and a slider\nis analogous to a grindbar in skate-boarding. The WakeMK cable was\nalso much tighter than the cable we\nregularly ride; theoretically making\nit easier to Raley \u2013 launching into\nthe air from flat water.\nThere wasn\u2019t a cloud in the sky\nand the water was nearly flat as we\nstood on the dock ready for another\nhardcore day\u2019s riding. The morning\nstarted slowly as riders acclimatized to the different cable, however it was not long before confidence\ngrew and the obstacles were ses-sioned. John took the initiative and\neyed up a boardslide on the slider\non the far side of the lake which\nwas sporting a distinctive paint-job, very reminiscent of a cow. His\nfirst few attempts resulted in some\nnasty-looking slams into the slider\nfollowed by a long swim each time.\nPerseverance soon paid off and he\nmanaged to slide the entire length\nand ride away clean. Understandably chuffed he was ecstatic to discover that he had just conquered\nthe longest slider in the country.\nWith the gauntlet well and truly\nthrown down Will took on the 6ft\nhigh funbox and had some early\nsuccess before slipping and butt-checking the edge of the box. Undeterred he continued and pulled\na 50:50 across the funbox, adding\na cheeky 180 off the end. Fresher\nDave also wanted part of the action\nand started hitting the long slider\nwith the cow-inspired paintjob.\nWhilst not quite able to reach the\nend of it he still managed to ride\naway every time. Darko took an alternative route and decided to try\nand go aerial by Raleying. Despite\nsome very brave attempts and some\npainful-looking faceplants tired\narms started to take their toll and\nhe switched to some wakeskating\n(like wakeboarding but there are no\nbindings, thus opening up a raft of\nskateboardesque tricks). Honours\nfor best performance of the day ultimately went to John who went on\nto boardslide the imposing looking\nA-frame slider on his first attempt.\nAfter nearly 5 hours riding the\ncable, darkness finally brought the\nweekend\u2019s wakeboarding to a close.\nOverall the weekend had been a\nhuge success with all riders making significant strides forward in\ntheir wakeboarding as well as having had an awesome time.\nWe\u2019d like to thank the Union\u2019s\nTours board for their generous contribution to travel costs, Jenny\u2019s\nparents for allowing us to crash at\ntheir house, Jenny for driving the\nminibus, Matt for driving the boat\nand the members and cable monkeys at WakeMK for their brillant\nadvice and welcoming atmosphere.\nCreating waves with wakeboarding\nSamuel Murphy\nDavid Weir\nReal guns, fake pigeons\n\u2018Jubilee\u2019 class 4-6-0, No. 5690\nCheck my flow: ICwakeboarding\u2019s first ever tour took its members to the tropical waters of Northampton\n22 felix Friday 12 January 2007\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES clubsandsocs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

I also\nremember a certain Will Dugdale,\nwho was Felix Editor two years in\nAnother try at banning two year sabbatical positions\nTwo year sabbs, eh? Those foolish\nfolk that enjoy their year as veritable kings of the Union so much that\nthey want to have another crack at\nit?\nApparently this year\u2019s team have\nhad enough already, and don\u2019t want\nto stand next year, as a paper was\nput to Council that would ban two\nyear sabbaticals (or only allow them\nin certain cases, for example from\nDeputy President to President).\nIt seems the Council wasn\u2019t having this, and voted it down after a\ngreat deal of general hand-wring-ing and pontification.\nThis is despite the horrible reputation of notable two year sabbs\nfrom recent years (c.f. Mustafa \u201cit\u2019s\nnot illegal if the President does it\u201d\nArif, and Sen \u201cthe unremarkable\u201d\nGanesh).\nSameena was a two year sabb,\nmoving up from Deputy President\nMustafa Arif, seen here fellating a microphone (we think)\na row, but apparently that\u2019s not a\nproper sabb.

Wielding suspiciously bulky bags, the mobbers\ncould have been taken for something more sinister. However, at the\npre-decided time, the bags were\ndropped to unveil pillows. The mob-bers then proceed to beat the living\nshit out of each other (on Queen\u2019s\nLawn) with said bed appliances before melting away into the Sherfield\nbuilding and environs before the\nvery eyes of the group of bemused\nonlookers in the JCR, SCR and\nQueen\u2019s Lawn.\nUnfortunately, your intrepid reporter managed to sleep in that\nmorning, and was therefore unable\nto show of his pillow-fighting skills,\nhoned during a dangerous two\nmonth tour at Ikea.\nSurprisingly, no-one was arrested on terrorism charges\nReversing a somewhat dismal\ntrend for Union events at the mo-ment, the end-of-term Christmas\nCarnival completely sold out, and\nby all accounts was a massive suc-cess.

Among the shock-horror results, it seems the medics\nwere heavily in favour of affiliation,\nwith 68% of those that voted voting\nyes. The other faculties were split\nroughly 50/50, showing how close\nthe referendum was in the end. It\nseems that the medic vote, plus the\nnon-faculty voters (sabbs, Tanaka\nfolk) was enough to secure the yes\nvote.\nNo-one was surprised, as the\nMedic President was known to be\nstrongly in favour of affiliation.\nReally, this story was just an excuse to use the fabulous picture to\nthe right.
