    "content": "FELIX\nFriday 02 MARCH 2012\n22\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment Editors: Tim Arbabzadah\nSam Horti\nCOMMENT\nFELIX\nI\nt took me approximately 4\nmonths to really understand how\nthe University and Union work.\nBoth of these organisations are\nlayered with bureaucracy, which\ndoesn\u2019t help. Additionally, you need to\nget to term time before various committees meet and the workloads hit a stage\nwhere acronyms like SRASOC* start\nrolling off the tongue. (*Student Recruitment and Admissions Strategy and\nOperations Committee)\nAs you would expect, being President\nI have to spend a good portion of my\ntime thinking strategically, analysing the\nthreats and risks to the Union and working out how to mitigate them. This is\nalso true for my Executive Committee,\nwho recently, and very unjustly, were\ncriticised in a comment piece for their\ndecision this term to \u2018redistribute\u2019 10%\nof club funding. And redistribute is the\nright word.\nClubs currently receive a cash grant to\nassist with their operations. This money\nis distributed at a rather hellish meeting\nknown as CSB budgeting, which I attended on Monday for the third time in\nas many years.\nAt that meeting last year we made\navailable a staggering \u00a3337,000 of the\nfunding the College gives the Union to\noperate. For 2012/13 we are providing\n\u00a3303k. Our plan is to use the difference\n(\u00a333k) to help clubs and societies in\nways that are more effective than the \u00a32\nper each club membership that has been\nreallocated.\nWe intend on providing a new website with more functionality. We shall\nincrease the volunteering opportunities\navailable to our members, assist societies in finding sponsorships, provide\neven better training and establish a \u2018club\nhardship fund\u2019 to provide struggling societies with the necessary financial as-sistance.\nThis will all be done in the face of a\nprobable 0% change in funding from\nCollege, a 5% increase in staffing cost\n(a college HR decision), inflation sitting\nat 4.2% and our bars running at a minimum profit level to ensure they are as\ncheap for students as they can be.\nThe result of this will be simple: we\nknow that our plans will cost more than\nthe \u00a333k we have redistributed. As such,\nwe will be spending more on Clubs, Societies, and Projects next year than we\nhave this, and more than we did the year\nbefore.\nHowever I do find two things rather\nworrying.\nFirst is the huge disparity between the\nlevels of support the Union provides for\ndifferent activities. All overseas clubs\nsocieties, which have a current membership of 2,130, receive \u00a35,270 of \u2018cash\u2019\nsupport. Compare this to the \u00a313,840\nthat the 61 members of gliding received\nfor their activities and you might also\nshare a little of my concern. Of course,\nthere are reasons that we support gliding so highly, most of which relate to its\nhigh cost. But equally there does need to\nbe a time when we ask if activities like\nthis are sustainable and whether they\nprovide a benefit to our members that\nmeans we can justify sacrificing support\nelsewhere.\nThe second concern is how little financial assistance we provide to the\nRepresentation and Welfare branches\nof our Union. This year we hosted Rep\nWeek, a cross-campus event designed to\nmake your representatives more visible\nand to get feedback on what you would\nlike to see improved. For this we provided all Departmental Representatives\nwith polo shirts. It was a small gesture,\nconsidering all of the hard work these\npeople put in, and cost very little \u2013 about\n0.1% of the CSB budget. However this\nis easily the most we have ever spent on\nour Dep Reps!\nNow I guess some of you may be\nwondering about the title of this piece,\nespecially as to what a General Meeting\nmight actually be. So let me explain. A\ngeneral meeting is an open forum of at\nleast 200 members. It can be attended by\nanyone who wants to go and attendees\ncan add items to the agenda. It\u2019s a place\nwhere big strategic items and questions\ncan be discussed. These meetings are\ncommonplace in Student Unions across\nthe UK but the last one held by Imperial\nCollege Union happened over 5 years\nago.\nI believe we should hold this GM to\ntalk about the questions I have raised in\nthis piece but also to discuss some other\nconcerns I have.\nIn a comment piece last week, it was\nsuggested that the Executive Committee structure needs to change. Though\nI disagree with this, I do believe that\none Union committee does need to be\naltered: our Trustee Board. The TB can\noverturn decisions made by the Union\nCouncil, authorise expenditure over\n\u00a31m and set out the Union\u2019s strategy.\nIt\u2019s time for a Union\nGeneral Meeting\nIt would be reasonable to imagine that\nsuch a Committee would have the people that you elect to lead your Union, the\nSabbatical Officers, as members. However this is not the case. As President I\nam the only Sabbatical who has a vote.\nThe remaining votes are taken by four\nstudents, the chair of council, a former\nPresident (the Court chair) and four external members.\nIf all Trustees are in attendance there\nis a majority to current students and\ntheir representatives. However some\nStudent Trustees have variable attendance and, more worryingly, variable\nunderstanding of what students need\nfrom their Union. An example of this\nis one person being elected to this role\nlast year to \u2018get more weights in Ethos\u2019\n\u2013 something the Trustee Board is never\nin a position to do!\nThe result of this is that there is a giant\nrisk that the voices of people external to\nour Union can be more influential than\nour members and subsequently decisions could be made about our long-term future that we do not support.\nSo in the Summer Term I shall invite\nall Union members to attend a General Meeting. Here we shall discuss\nour Trustee Board Structure and our\nresourcing. However I also believe we\nshould use this opportunity to discuss\nthe purpose of each committee we have,\nand adjust their structures accordingly.\nI also believe it is time to assess the remits and roles of our Sabbatical Officers\nto ensure they provide a benefit to the\nstudent body that matches their cost and\njustifies the commitment of the people\nwho hold these positions. And finally,\nmore than anything, I believe it\u2019s time\nto host a meeting like this: one which\nis open and transparent, to provide all\nmembers an opportunity to hear about\nour potential risks and contribute to\nsome potential solutions.\nGenerally\nmeet people\nall the time.\nWhy not tell\nus about it:\nfelixonline.\nco.uk\nScott Heath\nIt probably won\u2019t look like this\nThis week marks the second-ever Felix\nSex Survey. Its return was almost a giv-en, following the sheer response last\nyear, both in terms of respondents and\nfeedback following publication. One\nyear on, we decided to improve upon\nlast year\u2019s results in any possible way\nwe could find. It is thanks to the vast\nresponse from across Imperial and\ndedicated individuals working behind\nthe scenes with the collected data that\nwe have been able to produce results\non this scale. We very much hope that\nyou enjoy reading it, yet, at its core,\nthere are interesting debates that can\nbe found.\nMany have stated in correspondence\nto Felix regarding the survey that sex\nremains almost a taboo subject at Imperial. Nevertheless, many also think\nthat the unwillingness to more openly\ndiscuss sex is perhaps an old fashioned viewpoint, and that we, as a com-munity, should be more willing to tackle\nit head on. After all, welfare and sexual\nhealth are hugely relevant to university\nlife.\nAt the very least, we hope that the\nsurvey results raise awareness of welfare at Imperial and goes some way towards debunking some of the common\nstereotypes that Imperial finds itself\nwith.\nFelix would like to take the opportunity to reiterate the fact that extreme\ncare has been taken by everybody\ninvolved in analysis or data collection to ensure that all data provided\nremains strictly anonymous. Indeed,\nthe data that we have collected over\nthe past month has been deleted. No\ndetails can be tracked to any specific\nindividual.\nIn the future, we shall be considering conducting more surveys that cover\na wider range of topics than those already encountered. One potential area\nthat we are keen to look at is the potential for sexism, as voiced by writers in\nthis very section recently, at university.\nIf you have any interest in any aspect of\nthe production of a survey, then please\nfeel free to get in touch with us.\nThe Sex Survey returns\n\u2013 there are no cheap\nthrills to be found here\n\n"

    "content": "T\nim: First off, I apologise\nif I ask any questions\nthat you\u2019ve been asked\nbefore...\nChris: Well, it\u2019s kind\nof difficult not to do that. It\u2019s the nature of interviews. I once did a proper\npress junket day where you\u2019d stay in\na room and people come in every five\nminutes and it\u2019s fucking weird \u2013 you\nthink you\u2019re going out of your mind.\nSo don\u2019t worry about it, it can\u2019t be as\nbad as that.\nT: Let\u2019s start with The Thick of It.\nOllie, the character you play, what I\nalways think about him is that he\u2019s\nactually quite a horrible person. He\ndoes some really unlikeable things\nbut he\u2019s very likeable and I think\nthat\u2019s kind of a testament to you\nand your acting the fact that you\u2019ve\nmade this character who is not very\nlikeable on the face of it be an actual\nquite likeable character \u2013 what\u2019s\nyour take on that?\nC: I think the reason Ollie is likeable \u2013\nhere\u2019s the thing \u2013 Toby, his counterpart\nin In the Loop is rather less likeable\nthan Ollie. Toby\u2019s a proper shit. And\nOllie, yeah Ollie does some fairly un-likable things, as do all the characters,\nbut if there\u2019s anything that makes him\nlikeable is the fact that he\u2019s so spectacularly incompetent and he\u2019s a bit\ndowntrodden in a way. You know he\u2019s\nat the bottom of the pile and because\nhe\u2019s at the bottom of the pile you automatically feel slightly sorry for him\nand I think that feels a little bit like liking him.\nT: That\u2019s true, he is incompetent,\nand in fact that leads me quite well\nonto my next point. An American\nremake was made and it failed \u2013 do\nyou think that this should work well\nin America or do you think that they\nlike programmes where people are\nmore like well-oiled machines?\nC: Well I know it works over there\nbecause we made [In the Loop] as\nIn The Thick of It with Chris Addison a\nTim Arbabzadah goes on pun overload as he asks the stand-up comedian/actor about ev\na sort-of cousin to The Thick of It. It\nwas released in America and did well\nin America and it was nominated for\nan Oscar. The American pilot for ABC\nwas terrible \u2013 it had really, really good\npeople involved in it but it was terri-ble. But Armando Iannucci and one of\nthe writers Simon Blackwell created\na show for HBO which starts in April\ncalled Veep which is very much in the\nstyle of The Thick of It but with Americans. It has Julia Louis-Dreyfus as the\nVice President of America set in her\noffice. So you can definitely do it in\nAmerica, they absolutely love it. Well,\nthe blue states love it. The red states?\nEh\u2026 not so much.\nT: I like to compare the show to The\nWest Wing, where everyone has these\ngreat speeches and everyone\u2019s really\ngood at their jobs, whereas in The\nThick of It everyone\u2019s a little bit less\ngood...\nC:Well yeah, there\u2019s room for both of\nthose things, one of the things about\nThe West Wing is that it\u2019s a very hopeful show \u2013 it\u2019s very positive about the\npower of politics to do good and that\ndoesn\u2019t really turn up in The Thick of\nIt. The Thick of It is not cynical about\npolitics, it definitely isn\u2019t, but what you\nhave to remember is that The Thick of\nIt is a workplace sitcom. If you take the\npolitics out of The Thick of It \u2013 which\nmight seem like an odd thing to do,\nbut actually you should try this \u2013 you\nrealise that actually you\u2019re just dealing with a classic British workplace\nsitcom where a bunch of people who\ndon\u2019t really get on are thrown together\nin the same place and put under immense pressure and then we see what\nhappens to them in that situation. The\npolitics is the \u2018sit\u2019. It could have been\nsome people in a conference centre, or\na mechanics workshop, or a bakers, or\nanything, but it happens to be in the\nworld of politics. With The West Wing\nit\u2019s much more actually about politics\nand its machinations and it\u2019s also a\nsoap about the characters so you need\nmore emotional juice out of it.\nT: Can I now go back a little bit in\ntime? Not literally, obviously\u2026\nC:Well the answer to that is, no, you\ncan\u2019t. Literally, no, but figuratively,\ngive it a go.\nT: After university, did you go\nstraight into comedy?\nC: I went into comedy about a year\nafter I graduated. What they don\u2019t tell\nyou, what nobody ever tells you and\nwhat you\u2019re not particularly going\nto thank me for telling you (although\nit\u2019s probably best that I do) is that the\nyear after university is one of the worst\nyears of your life. Unless you\u2019re on a\nvocational course like medicine where\nthings sort of meld into your career, the\nyear after university is bleak and difficult because it\u2019s a big, big, big jolt.\nYou\u2019ve had 14 or 15 years of formal\neducation, you\u2019ve been in the place\nwhere all your friends are, you\u2019ve had\nroughly the same hours. If you want to\ndo stuff at the union, there are a billion\nthings you can do there with like-mind-ed people. But the minute you throw\nyour mortarboard up into the air it\u2019s\nover. It\u2019s over. The door is locked and\nbolted behind you and there\u2019s no way\nback in.\nIt\u2019s extremely depressing, and in that\nyear I became really bleakly depressed.\nI had done a lot of drama and so on \u2013\nnot acting \u2013 but directing a lot of plays\nas that was the thing I wanted to go on\nand do and it\u2019s really easy at university.\nIf you\u2019re doing a student production it\u2019s\na cheaper licence but if you\u2019re trying to\ndo it out in the real world it\u2019s fucking\nhard. You need to earn money while\ndoing it, you need to find people who\nwant to do it; it\u2019s a really, really hard\nthing to do. In the end I needed some\nkind of creative outlet and stand-up is\nthe easiest one. If you have no other\nskills, if you\u2019re not musical particularly or you can\u2019t draw or you know all\nof those sort of things\u2026 stand-up. It\u2019s\ndead easy. You just pitch up, somebody\nelse sorts the lights, the room and the\nadvertising. You just need to come up\nwith some words \u2013 that\u2019s all you have\nto do. So that\u2019s why I tried it really. I\u2019d\nnever planned it. I certainly didn\u2019t do\nanything like it at university \u2013 I wasn\u2019t\nin a revue or anything.\nT: I can imagine what my parents\u2019\nreaction would be if I told them I\nwanted to be a stand-up comic. It\nwould be something along the lines\nof, \u201cyeah, no, that\u2019s really funny but\ncan you actually do a real job at some\npoint?\u201d Were your parents OK with\nit?\nC: Yeah, they\u2019ve always been tremendously supportive. I think that once it\neventually \u2013 quite a long way down\nthe line \u2013 became clear that I was going to be alright they relaxed and really\nenjoyed it but they\u2019ve always been tremendously supportive. When I set out\nI gave myself five years and said, \u201cif\nin five years this is clearly going nor\nt\nt\n\u2013\nr\nt\n\u2019\nt\nt\nf\nWe couldn\u2019t exactly forget Malcolm Tucker now, could we?\n\u201cThe minute you\nthrow your mortarboard up in the air\nit\u2019s over\u201d\nFEATURE\nFELIX\n10\nfeatures.felix@gmail.com\nFeatures Editors: Katy Bettany\nStephen Smith\nFriday 02 MARCH 2012\n\n"

I\nsort of realised that I\u2019d been doing it\nfor five years and thought, \u201cOh yeah,\nwas this the point where I was going\nto take stock?\u201d Probably I would\u2019ve\ntold my parents something like that and\nthen that might have given them a bit\nmore hope. Parents just want you se-cure. They want you safe and they want\nyou secure \u2013 that\u2019s their main thing. I\nthink all parents out of everybody worry about their children\u2019s career choices\nwhether they\u2019re as outlandish or as\nsilly as mine.\nT: Back to The Thick of It \u2013 I\u2019ve seen\nyou said in interviews that people\nseem to have this sort of idea that\nyou\u2019re now a political commentator.\nDo you ever find that weird, sitting\non the couch of The Andrew Marr\nShow thinking, \u201cwhat am I doing\nhere?\u201d\nC: Well the Andrew Marr thing is in-teresting, because it\u2019s a paper review.\nIt has two functions: one is, it reviews\nthe papers, that\u2019s the obvious one. The\nother one is that it reveals a bit of the\npersonality of the people who are reviewing the papers. It\u2019s a little like a\ncross between an interview and com-mentary. Sometimes I have to go in\nand talk about things that I haven\u2019t\nactually got a direct relationship with,\nbut I\u2019ve always said no to doing Question Time. I used to think, \u201coh, what\u2019s\na comedian doing on Question Time?\u201d\nbut if it\u2019s somebody doing it well, it\u2019s\nreally good. If you watch Armando\n[Iannucci] when he\u2019s does it it\u2019s really\ninteresting because he plays the part of\nthe bewildered public and that\u2019s a really good role to have. That\u2019s not actually being a political commentator but\nbeing like a conduit for people wanting\nto call bullshit.\nT: Like being an everyman\ncharacter\u2026\nC: Yeah! Exactly. That\u2019s it. So yeah, I\ndon\u2019t comment on politics. You know,\nit\u2019s in my stand-up show, you know\nthere\u2019s some political stuff, there\u2019s\nsome personal stuff, some political\nbullshit and a lot of fucking about but\nI\u2019m not a crusader or anything like that.\nI enjoy politics, I enjoy the game aspect of politics \u2013 which is the bit that\u2019s\nmost harmful actually! I do comment\non people, if I\u2019m around during Question Time I will tweet through it but,\nyou know, I\u2019m not Andrew Lansley. I\nwould never claim to have knowledge\nabove anybody else\u2019s of the press.\nPeople who famously play doctors or\nvets often get asked questions about\nhealth...\nT: And you famously play a special\nadviser...\nC: \u2026so I must get asked about politics,\nyeah!\nT: I really should ask about your\nstand-up because you are a stand-up\ncomedian and I\u2019ve been very careful to make sure that you know that\nI know that you\u2019re not an actor \u2013\nyou\u2019re a stand-up comedian and an\nactor. So your stand-up show, this\nyear it hasn\u2019t got a theme has it.\nC: No, that was deliberately chosen because I used to write shows that were\nvery heavily themed and that was de-liberate. Well, obviously it\u2019s very hard\nto accidentally write something and say\nit has a theme \u2013 but it was deliberate\nin that I would take it up to Edinburgh.\nThere are a gazillion comics in Edinburgh and you need to do something to\nstand out. That\u2019s why I did those shows\nand when I came back to stand-up after a few years of enforced absence I\nwanted to have a show that was just\nstraight stand-up really and very talky\nbecause I just wanted to get back to the\nroots of it. I thoroughly enjoyed it, so\nfor the last two shows I\u2019ve avoided doing a theme.\nT: You\u2019ve worked extensively in ra-dio. Is that a medium that you personally enjoy or is it about the different challenges? It\u2019s just about the\nsounds rather than the visual aspect\nafter all.\nC: Well, my first love of comedy came\nfrom the radio. When I was a kid, about\n11 or 12, on every sunday at 12:27pm\nRadio 4 used to repeat a classic radio\nseries like The Goon Show, I\u2019m Sorry,\nI\u2019ll Read That Again, Round the Horne\nand all those proper mid-twentieth century classic radio shows. That\u2019s one of\nthe first places that I found kind of \u2018my\ncomedy\u2019. I was brought up on radio\ncomedy really and it\u2019s always seemed\na natural thing to me.\nEventually I got my own series The\nApe That Got Lucky in 2005. The first\nday that we did the actual show and\nthere were four microphones standing\nthere and the four of us in the cast there,\neach with our scripts, standing back\nand forth at the microphones waiting\nfor our turn to speak, it sounds genuinely exciting. You know, I\u2019ve seen\npictures of the Goons doing this and\nthis is what I\u2019ve loved for years. When\nI was maybe 16, what I really wanted to\ndo was to go into radio. I listened religiously to what was then Manchester\u2019s\nPiccadilly Radio, it\u2019s changed now,\nbut there was a guy on there, James H.\nReeve. He used to forecast this call-in\nshow between 10 and 1 and I\u2019ve never\nheard anyone like him. He was urbane\nand funny and dry and it was an amazing show and I really wanted to do that\nso when I came to do the 5 Live satirical show that was great, I felt like I\u2019d\ndone both of the kinds of radio that I\u2019ve\nalways loved so, yeah, I really like it\nand I\u2019d like to do more of it really.\nT: Was that one of those tingly, almost out of body experiences where\nyou\u2019re almost looking at yourself doing something and you\u2019re like, \u201cOh\nmy god, I\u2019m actually doing this, this\nis happening\u201d?\nC: Yeah, I think so on both of those\noccasions. For the Radio 4 shows that\nwe recorded, it was so exciting, but in\nboth cases it was the microphones. It\nwas what the microphone looked like,\nwhere it was positioned and stuff.\nYou know, sitting in the 5 Live studio,\nwhich weirdly, was the 5 Live studio\nthat they used in The Thick of It\u2026\nT: Oh really, for the episode with the\nRichard Bacon interview?\nC: Yeah, which was charming and\nweird. But you know, occasionally you\nhave a real \u2018you are here\u2019 moments in\nlife. They\u2019re exciting, and both of those\noccasions were one.\nT: Was it intimidating and perhaps\na bit scary to come into something\nso established and so big as Mock\nthe Week and suddenly being the\nnew \u2018regular guy\u2019 \u2013 did you feel that\npressure?\nC: The thing is it wasn\u2019t that sudden.\nI\u2019d done Mock the Week about 11 times\nbefore I became a regular. I was on a\nlot for the three series previous to becoming fully paid up so all it felt like\nwas a step up in commitment. When I\ninitially did it, I thought it would be terrifying to the point that I went and saw\nit recorded the week before. My experience of big panel shows and things\nlike that has always been that after the\nfirst one you do of any particular panel\nshow you come away going \u201cah yeah,\nyeah, I get that now, I know how that\nworks\u201d and I wanted to find that as far\nas I could so I went to the recording a\nweek before so I had more of an idea of\nhow the show worked on the night. I\u2019d\nalso spent years saying \u201cno no no, I\u2019m\nnot going to do Mock the Week\u201d out of\nfear really. I finally sort of bit the bullet and did it and absolutely loved it.\nI\u2019ve always really, really enjoyed doing\nit, and I was quite surprised by that at\nthe beginning which is why i think they\nkept having me back, because I was enjoying myself. When they finally said\n\u201cdo you want to come and do this full\ntime\u201d it wasn\u2019t such a big leap.\nT: Now that you\u2019re a full regular, do\nyou feel that with the younger comedians and the guys who come on for\nthe first time, that you\u2019re trying to\nhelp them out, trying to not cut them\noff, and trying to make sure that they\nget to showcase what they want to\nshowcase?\nC: I think Mock the Week has had a\nreputation for quite a long time of being a real bear pit where people would\nleap over each other\u2019s jokes and all of\nthat kind of thing. You could see that\nI think, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like that\nnow. I think it\u2019s very different and I\nthink there\u2019s a lot more space given to\npeople. Dara [O\u2019Briain] is extremely\ngood because he plays the part of the\ntraffic policeman in the centre of it all,\nwhich you don\u2019t see so much of in the\nedit, but because he\u2019s the host as well\nas introducing the show on camera it\u2019s\nkind of his job to ensure that everybody\ngets a say and he can kind of stop you\nand bring somebody in if you\u2019re getting too garrulous or overexcited. So\nyeah, people get their chance definite-ly. You have to sort of step up I think\nonce you\u2019ve been given the chance,\nwhich can sometimes be a bit intimidating and scary, but it\u2019s a much nicer\nand much more collaborative show\nthan its reputation once would have\nhad you believe.\nT: Thank you very much, it\u2019s been\namazing talking to you.\nC: Thanks, it\u2019s been nice to talk to you\ntoo \u2013 good luck with that year after the\nend of your studies!\nT: I\u2019ll now look forward to\ndespondence!\nChris Addison is on tour at venues\nacross the UK until June\n\u201cOccasionally you\nhave real \u2018you are\nhere\u2019 moments in\nlife\u201d\nFEATURE\nFELIX Friday 02 MARCH 2012 11\n\u2018Traffic policeman\u2019 Dara O\u2019Briain\n\n"

Each year the competition is\nhosted by one of the two schools at\ntheir home ground, with this year being\nthe turn of the CSM to host down in\nCornwall. The Bottle Match is the biggest weekend of the year for any Royal\nMiner and always delivers in high ten-sions, heavily contested matches, excessive nudity, (most-likely-gone-too-far) banter and filthy hangovers.\nWith 150 people on board the coaches left London and made it to Cornwall\nwithout in record time, before becoming stuck up a country lane and one\nhaving to be literally pushed out of the\nmud! So we arrived at the caravan site\na little late but had the comforting news\nthat during our travels the Squash and\nGolf teams, who had left ahead of us\nfor their games, had won and drawn\ntheir respective contests, meaning that\nthe first two trophies of the weekend\nwere returning to London. The Saturday saw the bulk of the sport, with the\nmen\u2019s and ladies hockey, football, netball and the all-important rugby which\ndecides the home of The Bottle for the\nnext year.\nAfter a successful weekend the Bottle remains to grace the Union Bar for\nanother year, and the miners return to\nLondon victorious (if a little battered\nand broken).\nIntroduction by\nRoyal School of Mines Union President Richard Simons\nBeing the first to arrive in Camborne\nthe RSM Squash team kicked off\nproceedings, captained by Nat ElliotGreen (N.E.G), calling on the experience of the veterans Henry Debens\nand Mark Porter, and the youth and\nvitality of the French freshers Raphael Pesquidous and Marc Lelong.\nEach player gave it their all, barring\nMr Debens who allowed a 2-0 lead to\ndrag out to a 3-2 victory, with 4 of the\n5 RSM players nothing up a perfect\nscore sheet of 3-0. RSM claimed\nthe whitewash, winning 15 games to\nCSM\u2019s 2, and got the weekend going to the best of starts by bringing\nhome the A.L Thomas Memorial Trophy for the second year on the trot.\nN.E.G\nSquash\nCSM 0-5 RSM\nAfter last year\u2019s victory, the team was\nfeeling confident, since we had retained most of last year\u2019s squad and\nhad also added some quality freshers\nto our ranks. We started the game\nwell and a scrappy CSM into conceded several penalties which resulted in\ntheir scrum-half being sin binned. We\nspent most of this half camped on\ntheir try line but were unable to capi-talise until the 35th minute when FraRugby\nCSM 0-22 RSM\n(Largest margin in\nBottle Match history!)\nser \u201cThe Salmon\u201d James leapt over\nfor the first try of the game, leaving\nthe score at half time 7-0 RSM.\nWe started the second half in a similar fashion to the first, but were once\nagain unable to cross the line as CSM\nfought bravely in defence. Finally in\nthe 60th Sam \u201c1.0\u201d Coe crashed over\nafter good work from the forwards and\nwe never looked back. Minutes later\nChris McGeough charged down the\nwing and steamrolled past several\ndefenders like a runaway train. Then\nin the last play of the game Captain\nEd \u201cEGV\u201d drove in off a maul for the\nfinal score of the game. Notable performances came from George Lane,\nJames Scaife, Mike Floyd and Fred\nWhite. Olly Cox somehow claimed\nman of the match from their captain,\nwhich will forever remain a mystery.\n\u201cBroken\u201d Ed Vaughan\nConsidering this was the first match\nRSM played as a team we did really\nwell. We only lost the first quarter,\nso after finding our feet we went on\nto draw or win in the next 3. Unfortunately it was too little too late, and\nCSM claimed their first victory in\nBottle Match netball. The natural talent of the RSM shone through and\nthere is no doubt that next year we\u2019ll\nwin it back.\nRachel Zaborski\nNetball\nCSM 38-29 RSM\nIn the first game of Saturday both\nteams had a strong opening half,\ndespite the barrage of abuse pouring in from each side, but CSM took\nan early lead with a well-placed short\ncorner. The first half carried on with\nhigh intensity play from both sides\nand continued with a few more questionable tackles (including one that\nprobably belonged on a rugby pitch)\nwhich went unnoticed by the ref-erees. A second short corner from\nCSM was mis-hit but then recovered\nto bring the score to CSM 2 - 0 RSM\ntowards the end of the first half.\nThe second half saw the RSM Ladies stage a comeback, with Harriet\nStevenson bringing the score to 2\n- 1. RSM continued to put pressure\non the CSM squad for the remainder of the second half but the robust\ndefence of CSM meant the game\nended CSM 2 \u2013 1 RSM.\nSarah Hayes\nLadies\u2019 Hockey\nCSM 2-1 RSM\nRSM Hockey has enjoyed its\nusual mix of unbounded success\nand abject misery this season, but\nwe arrived for this year\u2019s Sharpley\nCup with high hopes. Some sneaky\nweaving from the Camborne attack opened our defence up inside\nthe first 5 seconds... panic over,\nthough, and we soon settled into a\nfast-paced - but evenly matched -contest. James, Freddie, Lionel and\nHarry soaked up the pressure from\nthe notable talents of the CSM at-tack, until a well-placed cross was\nMen\u2019s Hockey\nCSM 3-1 RSM\nconverted after 15 minutes: 1-0\nCSM. The response didn\u2019t take long,\nhowever, with Lionel scoring from a\nsublime short corner to level it.\nThe midfield of Scouse, Mikey and\nJake continued to give it everything\ninto the second half, but were\nunable to present Ewan,\nMash and Ben upfront with a clear-cut chance\nfor what\ncould have\nbeen the\nall-important second goal. The pace\nstarted to tell into the last quarter,\nand two CSM goals in quick succession finished the game off.\nMan of the Match goes to Lionel\nSumner for his tireless\nperformance, Champagne Moment to Jonnie Clowes for any one\nof his 573 immense\nsaves. Massive respect\nto everyone who played, and\ncheers to all the supporters.\nMikey Pettit\nThe first match out was between\nthe two best ranking golfers and\nwas a close match, ending in a\nwin for the CSM on the 17th hole.\nNext out where the two girls, Sorcha and Rachel (a non-CSM ring-er!) but Sorcha brought home the\nmatch comfortably despite a glorious shank into a greenside bun-ker. The third pairing, consisting\nof Alec and some other bloke was\nover by the 16th, leaving the CSM\n2:1 up with only one match left.\nAt this point, moral was low and\na victory for CSM was on the ho-rizon. But with courage and determination Steve Hayward fought off\nhis competitor to bring the score\nto 2 all. Since the RSM golfers\nwon the previous year, the trophy\nremains in its rightful place (In a\ntree next to the football pitch in\nPool). Special thanks go out to the\nGolf Manageress Celia Hayes for\nher support and encouragement\nthroughout.\nRyan Manvell\nGolf\nCSM 2-2 RSM\nFootball\nCSM 0-0 RSM\nIn a titanic effort from both sides,\nCSM and RSM fought out a gritty, well\ncontested goalless draw. After a frenetic opening, RSM settled into their\nrhythm first. At the half way stage it\nwas already evident that goals would\nbe very hard to come by, with set\npieces likely to be pivotal in deciding\nthe outcome. RSM repeatedly forced\ncorners, followed by CSM chances\nrequiring several stunning save from\nRSM custodian, Daly. The final whistle blew. Either side could claim that\nthey deserved victory, yet there was a\ntacit acceptance that a draw was unquestionably the fairest result on the\nday, after sterling performances from\ntwo very, very well matched teams.\nMatt Day\n\n"

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX Friday 02 March 2012 15\nTwinkle, twinkle, little star\nMarie-Laure Hicks on why we need sleep \u2013 and why eight hours might be too much\nE\nvery student faces the eternal dilemma: balancing\nwork, having a social life\nand sleep. On average, we\nhumans spend a third of\nour lives sleeping. So what is sleep and\nis it really that important?\nThere are two main types of sleep.\nThe first type is composed of four\nstages. Stage I is called light sleep, during which muscle activity slows down\nand you doze off. Brain activity is described by low-amplitude beta waves.\nStage II, or true sleep, sees a slowdown\nof the breathing pattern and heart rate,\nas well as lower frequency, higher amplitude theta waves. Stage III, or deep\nsleep, is characterised by delta waves,\nwhich have a higher amplitude and lower frequency. During this period, your\nbreathing and heart rate are at their low-est. During the final Stage IV, breathing\nbecomes rhythmic and limited muscle\nactivity takes place. The pattern then\nreverses. A complete cycle of this first\ntype of sleep takes between 70 and 90\nminutes.\nThe second type of sleep is REM, or\nrapid eye movement, sleep. It describes\na number of episodes that occur three\nto five times over a night\u2019s sleep. During these events, rapid eye movement\ntakes place and brain activity is almost\nas high as when you are awake. The\nbreathing rate and blood pressure rise.\nFor most people, the body is paralysed\nand unable to regulate its temperature. It\nis during these periods that you dream.\nEach non-REM sleep cycle is generally followed by increasingly long\nREM episodes. The use of REM episodes is unclear, as their prevention\ndoes not seem to have any important ef-fects. A strong rebound follows after the\nprevention is ended, however.\nThe causes and reasons for a large\npart of sleep behaviour remain a mys-tery. It is thought that the circadian cy-cle, effectively a body clock, regulates\nperiods of drowsiness and sleepiness\ndepending on light and darkness. But\nhow much do we really need to sleep?\nA number of theories exist on the\noptimal sleep time. Of course, there is\nthe widely known and recommended\neight-hour sleep. Thomas Wehr and\nRoger Ekirch, on the other hand, suggest segmented sleep: two blocks of\nfour hours with a couple of hours resting in between. Some research has suggested that long sleep is actually less\nhealthy than short sleep. Most people\ntend to sleep between 6 and 10 hours\na night. Overall there is no consensus,\nother than that we need to sleep enough\nto avoid being tired the next day.\nSleep deprivation can have serious\nconsequences. In 1965, Randy Gardner\nstayed awake for 11 days. Overall, he\nremained fairly healthy \u2013 he was even\nable to win at pinball \u2013 but he experienced hallucinations, difficulty concentrating and became basically cognitive-ly dysfunctional. Sleep disorders can\nstrongly impact people\u2019s daily lives.\nDr Gillian Twigg, at the sleep centre in\nCharing Cross Hospital, specialises in\nthe study and diagnosis of these disor-ders. Unusual behaviour can take place\nduring sleep, especially REM episodes,\nlike shouting, kicking, and sleepwalking and is caused by disruptions in the\nsleep cycle or abnormal awakenings.\nA more common and concerning sleep\ndisorder is obstructive sleep apnoea:\nthe muscles and soft tissues of the\nthroat collapse and prevent breathing.\nThese disorders can be diagnosed after\na night at the sleep centre, measuring\nblood pressure, oxygen levels, heart\nrate, breathing, blood oxygen levels and\nbody movement.\nMost patients who suffer from sleep\ndisorders experience severe tiredness\nand mood swings during the day. There\ncan be memory impairments and some\npeople find it debilitating. Sleep is a\nstrange thing. Its use is still unclear,\nbut disruptions have severe repercus-sions. The rest of the animal world does\nnot provide much help with answering\nthese questions. Dolphins, for example,\nare capable of maintaining half of their\nbrain asleep whilst the other is awake\nand bullfrogs don\u2019t seem to sleep much\nat all.\nThank you to Dr Twigg and her team\nat the Imperial College Healthcare\nsleep centre, Charing Cross Hospital.\nAre you getting enough sleep? We\u2019re certainly not, but these guys are...\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone in my scepticism of the apparent healing properties of alcohol when suffering from a\ncold or general post-Saturday-night\ndivine punishment. Yet the latest research conducted at Emory University, Atlanta, suggests that fruit flies\ngenuinely use alcohol to combat infection \u2013 from parasitic wasps.\nAs you may well have inferred from\ntheir imaginative name, fruit flies\n(Drosophila melanogaster) eat rotten\nfruit, or more accurately, the yeast\nthat decays said fruit. As by-products\nof the decaying process, yeast produces carbon dioxide and ethanol, thus\nrendering the fruit slightly alcoholic.\nSubsequently, the fruit fly has evolved\nresistance to the harmful effects of alcohol (in the form of the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase), an adaptation\nnot exhibited by the parasitic wasps\n(Leptopilina boulardi and Leptopilina\nheterotoma) that deposit their eggs in\nits circulatory system.\nThis disparity in ethanol resistance\nprompted Todd Schlenke and his colleagues to feed healthy and parasited\nfruit flies in an environment containing untreated and alcohol-coated fruit,\nthe latter ranging in concentration\nfrom that of medium strength lager to\nSpecial Brew (4-10%). They observed\nthat the parasitised flies overwhelmingly preferred the alcoholic to the\nregular fruit (80 to 20% respectively),\nwhereas only thirty percent of healthy\nflies were equally enticed. These\nnumbers show a conscious decision\non behalf of the parasitised flies to actively seek out the alcoholic fruit in\na bid to remedy their infection. This\nproved to be an excellent tactic: the\ndegree of oviposition (egg laying) by\nthe wasps in these flies was reduced\ngreatly by the presence of ethanol,\nSchlenke explains why:\n\u201cThe wasps die [from ethanol ex-posure] and all of their organs are diverted through their anus. Their guts\nactually pop out..\u201d\nApologies to anyone eating their\nlunch for the vivid mental image\npainted by Schlenke, but it\u2019s clear\nthat it is in the wasps\u2019 best interests\nto steer clear of the ethanol-inducing\nflies. Schlenke also goes on to state\nthat the investigation documents the\nfirst evidence that alcohol consumption can act as a defensive mechanism against infectious diseases and\nparasites, but before you hit the bottle\nto cure your ailments remember that\nthe fruit fly\u2019s alcohol tolerance is the\nresult of millions of years of evolution in an ethanol-rich environment,\nnot consecutive nights in the student\nunion.\nDOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2012.01.045\nHair of the\nbug\nRobert Treasure\nWant to write for\nFelix Science?\nSend us an email:\nscience.felix@\nimperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 02 MARCH 2012 23\nCOMMENT\nFELIX\nI\nt might be hard to believe, but I\nactually started this article before Stephen Smith\u2019s excellent\narticle on sexism at Imperial and\nthe superb piece on feminism by\nVeronica Gouvea. Stephen explored particular issues at Imperial and Veronica\nexplained why feminism is important. I\nfeel this piece is now a synthesis of the\ntwo including a reminder of what women\nface in society at large.\nWhilst we have made vast improvements over the last 100 years on legislated misogyny, it remains that the female\nis one of the last subsets of humanity\nagainst which it is possible to get away\nwith real discrimination in our society.\nDiscrimination faced by women permeates all areas of our lives \u2013 from professional through recreational to social\ninteractions. It appears in all forms and\nguises, some intentional, others accidental and, perhaps crucially, rarely as overt\nand declared misogyny.\nProfessionally, discrimination comes\nin two main forms \u2013 the \u2018boys club\u2019\nwhich can be sometimes be found at\nthe top of big institutions (14 of the 100\nFTSE firms have no women on their\nboards) and the just as destructive, ever-present myth that women are somehow\ninferior to men at top jobs. Now you may\nfeel that the second point is no longer\nbelieved by anyone with half a neuron;\nI disagree. It is still present and, it seems\nto me, often manifests itself in women\nthemselves. The statistics would suggest\nthat there is always a nagging doubt that,\nwhen things get tough, a woman is not\nsuited to a career in something \u2018important\u2019(e.g. politics, business, science). For\nexample, there were only 861 female\nAt times, women are actively disliked\ncandidates at the last general election\n(3284 male) even though women were\njust as likely to be elected (15% chance\noverall, ~15% for men, ~16% for wom-en).\nRecreationally, women face not discrimination but a propagation of myths\npertaining to a women\u2019s role in society.\nThis ranges across a broad spectrum,\nwhich I\u2019ve crassly decided to group\ntogether: from magazines to advertisements through to poorly constructed\nfemale film characters (which itself is\na separate crime against cinema) and\nimages of ideal women. This can be\nanything from magazine articles asking women \u201cshould you be pregnant by\nnow?\u201d (Glamour) to advertisements for\ncleaning products that feature consistently women, and all the way to Bond girls.\nAll of these clearly place the emphasis\nof women\u2019s role in society on children,\nhousekeeping and pleasuring men.\nWhilst I am in no way insinuating that\nmy female readers cannot critically interpret all of these, it seems, and my female\nfriends have supported my view here,\nthat there is a general cumulative effect.\nThat is to say, it is easy to ignore individual instances, but with such a huge\namount of \u2018information\u2019 depicting a certain role women must play in society it\nwill inevitably result in self-doubt which\ncan manifest itself at times of great importance in a person\u2019s life (career choic-es, for example).\nSocially, there seems to be a significant portion of the male population who\ndo actively dislike women, either that or\nthey are maddeningly unfunny comedians unable to make jokes about anything\nother than women. Add to that the sorts\nof daily incidents described by Stephen\n(rating of women etc) and you can see\nthat 50% of the population has to wade\nthrough a lot of shit for no obvious rea-son. I have no problem in people observing that someone is physically attractive\nand to state their desire to mate, but there\nis a difference between that and reducing\na person to physical attractiveness and a\nmeans for sex.\nThe \u2018comedic defence\u2019often employed\nby the kind of people who commented\non the recent UniLad apology is weak.\nI have no problem with humour being\noffensive (c.f. some of Frankie Boyle\u2019s\nmaterial). The problem arises when the\njokes are so badly constructed as to be\nunfunny even without the offensive element \u2013 then the joke merely becomes a\nvessel for prejudices.\nBefore you all rush to comment and\npoke holes in my arguments, I am not\nsuggesting any of the following: that\nthere is a misogynist conspiracy, that\nall men hate women, that women hate\nthemselves or that women shouldn\u2019t ever\nclean.\nFeminism shouldn\u2019t be the dirty word\nit is now, it\u2019s about equality and anyone\nwho believes in an equal society is, by\ndefinition, a feminist. To dismiss a whole\nseries of valid points about equality\nbased on the fact that a few people who\ndefine themselves as feminist are man-hating is a crime against good debating.\nLastly, I\u2019m not advocating some boring\nutopia where everyone is nice to one another and nothing offensive is ever said.\nAll I\u2019m saying is that, should you wish to\nbe insulting, don\u2019t make it about something someone has absolutely no control\nover \u2013 be a bastard indiscriminately.\n... should you wish\nto be insulting,\ndon\u2019t make it about\nsomething someone\nhas absolutely no\ncontrol over\n\u201c\n... shou\n... shou\nto be in\nto be in\n\u201d\nFrankie Boyle couldn\u2019t get away with Tramadol Nights not being that good\nLaurence de\nLussy Kubisa\nI\nmperial College Union\u2019s Clubs\n& Societies Board (CSB) voted\nto cut its contribution towards the\n\u201ctours pot\u201d from \u00a39,000 to \u00a30 at\nits annual budgeting round on\nMonday. The move, at the recommendation of Deputy President (Clubs & Societies) Monya Zard, was due to a \u00a37,500\nincrease in funding from the Imperial\nCollege Trust.\nICU policy states that tours \u201cfurther the\naims and objectives of a club or society,\nsupporting their core activities beyond\nwhich can be achieved through usual\nday-to-day, week-to-week operations\u201d.\nThe IC Trust, whose activities include\n\u201cthe promotion of charitable purposes\nfor the benefit of the College\u201d, is an independent charity. In recent years the trust\nhas donated \u00a39,000 for sports tours and\n\u00a310,500 for other tours \u2013 a generous total\nof \u00a319,500.\nAccording to Zard\u2019s October Council\npaper, the IC Trust met on 26th October\n2011 and agreed to increase its contribution from \u00a319,500 to \u00a327,000, although\nthe breakdown of this extra funding between sports and non-sports tours has not\nyet been made clear. Zard also stated that\nthe increase was down to \u201ccontinually\nincreasing numbers of tourists\u201d and gave\n\u201cHeather Jones and the Membership Services Manager\u201d credit for their successful application for extra IC Trust funding.\nAt the start of the annual club budgeting round, Zard proposed that the amount\nof money for tours should be decreased,\nor cut entirely, with the extra cash moved\nto the general club and society funds (re-quests for which were around \u00a380,000\nover the amount available). She said that\nthere was \u201cextra funding from the IC\nTrust\u201d for tours. When pushed for the fig-ures, Zard said that she thought that the\namount was previously \u201cabout \u00a310,000\u201d\nand was being increased to \u201csomething\nlike \u00a318,500\u201d (the absolute increase\nquoted by Zard being inaccurate to the\ntune of \u00a31,000). Zard couldn\u2019t even say\nwhether the amount granted by the IC\nTrust had yet been confirmed, but added\nthat it was pretty much guaranteed.\nThe motion was passed by CSB with\nfew objections, as the board railroaded\nthrough their decisions with no real discussion about the consequences. Other\ncuts that appeared to be made in an entirely arbitrary manner included cuts to\nthe amounts available to new clubs and\nprojects. In many cases it seemed like\nCSB members were plucking numbers\nfrom thin air, with a worrying lack of\ndiscussion about how funds had been utilised in previous years.\nAs far as the tours budget is concerned,\nthere is real cause for concern. Last year,\nall \u00a328,500 of tours funding was allo-cated. If the number of students embarking on tours is really increasing, as suggested by ICU\u2019s application for increased\nfunding, then next year\u2019s decreased pot\nof \u00a327,000 is likely to be stretched more\nthinly than ever.\nThe move could also sour relations\nbetween the union and the IC Trust, who\nhave presumably increased the funds\navailable in good faith that the number of\ntours can now increase. Conversely, all\nthat the extra cash seems to have done is\nhelp plug a gap in club and society fund-ing, caused by the redirection of Union\nsubvention to central Union operations.\nThe fact that the benevolence of the IC\nTrust has led to a \u00a31,500 decrease in\nfunding will surely lead the trust to question exactly why they bother offering this\nmoney if no commitment is shown by the\nUnion itself.\nAnonymous\nIn Imperial College we trust?\n\n"

    "content": "ACADEMY AWARDS SPECIAL\nFELIX Friday 02 MARCH 2012 35\nSilent film The Artist and 3D film\nHugo dominate on Oscar night\nThe 84th Annual Academy Awards\nceremony was presented Sunday\nnight, hosted by comedian and actor\nBilly Crystal. After last year\u2019s rather\ndisappointing ceremony with hosts\nAnne Hathaway and James Franco, in\nan attempt to reach a younger demo-graphic, Crystal returned to host the\nceremony for the ninth time.\nCrystal delivered a classy and traditional monologue, presenting some of\nthe night\u2019s nominees through his sense\nof musicality. Prior to the monologue\nwas a skit of Crystal debuting in some\nof the year\u2019s popular films, including Nine-time host Billy Crystal\nChristopher Plummer, Octavia Spencer, Meryl Streep, Jean Dujardin\nThe awards given to The Help\u2019s Octavia Spencer (Best Supporting Actress), and Beginners\u2019 Christopher Plummer\n(Best Supporting Actor,) were also well-received when both actors received a standing ovation from the audience.\nWhile many of the speeches made by winners throughout the night were predictable, full of many thank-yous and\ndedications, Meryl Streep\u2019s speech after a surprise win for Best Actress after her performance in The Iron Lady,\nwas one to go down in the books.\n\u201cI look out here and I see all my life before my eyes, my old friends, my new friends, and really, this is such a\ngreat honor. But the thing that counts the most with me is the friendships and the love, and the sheer joy we have\nshared making movies together,\u201d Streep said, thanking colleagues from her entire career.\nThe award for Best Actor was predictably given to Jean Dujardin (The Artist).\nGuess who?\nThe real head-turner, attention-grabber and scene-stealer of the\nnight was not J-Lo\u2019s wardrobe mal-function, but the owner of that right\nleg pictured on the left. It belongs\nto none other than Angelina Jolie who, in her black dress with a\nslit down the (you guessed it) right\nside, was the talking point of Hollywood.\nHer leg has since become so\nfamous that it has its own Twitter page, dubbed @angiesrightleg,\nwith cheeky little Tweets \u201cYou have\nto admit I\u2019m one hell of a leg\u201d and\n\u201cLeft leg and I talked - everything\u2019s\ncool. Next Oscars, she gets the\nslit\u201d already attracting more than\n38,000 followers. Albert Brooks\nwasn\u2019t impressed by the huge\npublic interest in the leg, writing\n\u201cI know genuinely funny people\nwho have like 5k followers and this\nhas 25k @AngiesRightLeg #endoftheworld\u201d\nPresenting the Best Adapted\nScreenplay award, Jolie attracted\nlaughter from the audience standing in her awkward pose that\nshowed off her leg.\nBess Donoghue\nThe Descendants and Midnight in\nParis, each had a brief moment\nof fame, winning Best Adapted\nScreenplay and Best Original\nScreenplay respectively. Both of\nthese awards were completely deserving of their praise.\nAfter a struggle to grab the interest of viewers the last couple of years, the\n84th Oscars may have created a positive future for the show. Billy Crystal\nkept the night running smoothly with his humorous skits, and all the attendees were charismatic and optimistic. Although comedy was present throughout the night, it was a classy and elegant event that when all mixed together,\nwonderfully celebrated another year of film.\nThe Descendants, in which he shared\na memorable and comedic kiss with\nactor George Clooney.\nThe awards received this year were\nin some ways predictable, but also\nexciting to witness. In regards to\nmany of the artistic categories, Martin\nScorsese\u2019s Hugo took the cake, winning Best Cinematography, Sound\nEditing, Sound Mixing, and Art Direction. Scorsese was a popular name\nthroughout the night as many of the\nwinners showed great appreciation for\nthe opportunity to work on the film.\nOf course, the other important winner for the night was The Artist, not\nonly winning Best Picture, but also\nDirector, Actor, Original Score, and\nCostume Design. This marked the\nfirst silent film to win the Best Picture\ncategory since the late 1920s, when\nsound started to first appear in motion\npictures.\nThe correlation between Hugo and\nThe Artist is striking, as both celebrate the history and advancement\nof cinema. While one reflects on the\nhistory of cinema, the other reenacts\nearly movie-making. With these two\nfilms as leaders for the night, the\nAcademy clearly valued the opportunity to celebrate the history of film,\nand the importance of cinema across\nthe globe.\nLegs, laughs, and Oscar highlights\n\n"

Needless\nto say the rest of the team were bitterly\ndisappointed, and are still refusing to\ntalk to John.\nIn the evening the excitement and\nadrenaline fueled slopestyle competition kicked off. With more Imperial\nentries into this freestyle comp. (8 in\ntotal), then any in recent years, there\nwas a real chance of glory. Solid runs\nwere landed by most of Imperial\u2019s\ncompetitors with fresher snowboarders\nRoss Maske and Mikkel (not Michael)\nKranker landing some sick tricks.

I think ICSMSU are lucky\nbecause by having a full time officer,\nwe are able to achieve a lot across the\nboard just because we have more time\nand faculty contact. That\u2019s not to say I\nthink they should be unequal, I would\nhighly support the other faculties getting sabb presidents.\nHow have you delivered on your\nmanifesto points so far?\nFortunately a lot of my manifesto\npoints were also aims of the college/\nICU \u2013 improving the \u2018completion of\nthe circle\u2019 with regard to feedback\nfrom students to faculty and vica\nversa was a key aim and has been addressed from all sides.\nDo you feel there\u2019s more prestige\nassociated with being ICSM President than the other positions?\nI am proud of having had the opportunity to held the position, so I suppose\nthere must be to some extent!

In the past few\nmonths, media attention has focused on\nthe risks of delivering aid to refugees\nand internally displaced persons (IDPs),\nafter Dr. Karel Keiluhu and Philippe\nHavet were killed in Mogadishu, Somalia and Blanca Thiebut and Montserrat\nSerra were abducted in Dadaaab, Kenya. Why did these four feel so passionate that they would risk their lives volunteering so far from home, what work\nwere they doing and how can you get\ninvolved to make their dreams reality?\nFirstly, let\u2019s consider the scale of the\nproblem. A refugee is defined as someone who has crossed a national border to\nflee conflict or persecution. Even if they\nmake it no further than a camp in the\nneighbouring country, under the 1951\nConvention on the Status of Refugees,\nthey have the right to protection from\nviolence, basic humanitarian assistance\nand a long-term solution (remain-ing in the country of refuge, resettling\nin a third country or returning home).\nIDPs are those who remain within their\ncountry of origin. The United Nations\nHigh Commission for Refugees (UN-HCR) has only assumed responsibility\ntowards certain IDP groups, leaving the\nmajority under the rule of their own\ngovernments, which are often implicated in the violence they are trying\nto escape. The UNHCR estimated in\n2009/2010 that there were 15.4 million\nrefugees and 27.5 million IDPs. About\nhalf come from Sudan, Iraq, Columbia, Palestine and Afghanistan. MSF\nworks with IDPs in all these areas and\nrefugees in neighbouring countries as\nwell, dealing with ongoing violence\nand limited or non-existent healthcare\ninfrastructure.\nThese issues are also concerns in Somalia, where MSF has provided medical aid since 1991. In addition to the\nviolence, the 2011 drought brought yet\nanother famine, displacing an estimated\n1.5 million people into the capital Mogadishu as well as neighbouring Kenya\nand Ethiopia (where MSF runs hospitals and health posts in refugee camps).\nA man mourning at his grandchild\u2019s funeral starkly illustrates this: \u201cOver the\nlast 3 years the farm dried up. We wanted to feed the children but there was\nnothing.\u201d With limited vaccine cover-age, childhood infections are rife, and\nquickly become epidemics in crowded\nrefugee camps. Mortality rates are 6\ntimes \u201cemergency levels\u201d as a result\nof extreme malnutrition. In 2008 MSF\nThe humanitarian organisation has a significant presence at Imperial \u2013 find out how to get involved\nKaushali Trivedi national staff performed over 700,000\noutpatient consultations and admitted\nover 24,000 as inpatients: they treated\nneglected tropical disease like kala azar,\nmalaria, tuberculosis, delivered antena-tal care, performed basic surgery, gave\nvaccinations and administered therapeutic feeding.\nArguably this is just a drop that can\nnever even hope to fill the ocean of need.\nEmergency humanitarian aid will never\nresolve the underlying issues. But as\nthe former president of MSF, Dr. James\nOrbinski, argues, \u201cIt\u2019s not about creating a perfect future, it\u2019s about responding to another person who is suffering\nas a human being\u201d. An MSF surgeon in\nIraq explains \u201cover half [our surgeries]\nare on emergency patients [with curable\nconditions]. We are making a real difference\u201d. Mary, a Burundian woman\nwhose life was saved by an emergency\nblood transfusion puts it more simply:\n\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for MSF, my five children\nwouldn\u2019t have a mother\u201d.\nThank you for reading despite my\nreliance on numbers as evidence both\nfor the importance of the situation\nand that MSF\u2019s work is significant. So\nhow can you help make that differ-ence? Get informed: the MSF website\n(http://www.msf.org.uk/) is full of\nblogs from doctors, logisticians and\npatients, reports giving overviews of issues and other resources.

This is easily the first time since we left ULU we\nhave worked so closely with other SUs\nin London.\nI can also say that our Freshers\u2019Week\nwas very successful and great experience \u2013 even if I did give 18 talks in four\ndays!\nF: What have you been most satisfied\nwith during your time in the role?\nS: The performance of the entire team;\nboth the staff and Sabbaticals.\nWe have done some amazing things\nin the year so far and it has only been\npossible with the support of everyone\nand the great team dynamic we have.\nThe NSS Response which we wrote\nas a guide to improving the student experience has had a huge effect, changing policy in the College, triggering\ncommittees to creating working groups\nand really emphasising what students\nneed to make their time here better.\nI have also managed to increase the\nrepresentative power of the Union by\nsecuring us seats on more committees\nand making it regular for the Union\nto meet the Principles of Faculties. I\nhave also secured confirmation that the\nUnion will participate in the processes\nto select the next Rector and Pro-Rector (Education).\nThis year we even received an invite\nto the Rector\u2019s Away Day for the first\ntime in our history.\nF: What have been least satisfied\nwith during your time in the role?\nS: Most of the time I that I have\nbeen dissatisfied it has been with the\nCollege. Last year there were large\namounts of negative feeling towards\nCollege Management due to the Life\nSciences restructure. We had all expected that this would have shown the\nCollege the importance of considering\nstudent opinions and the necessity of\nproviding greater consultation. However it isn\u2019t too hard to see that this is\nnot the case. Look at the Holland Club.\nIf the College had announced they were\ngoing to give a \u00a34m make over to the\nvenue very few people would have\nbeen concerned. However by keeping\nall plans undercover and disclosing as\nlittle as possible they have created an\neven bigger air of suspicion about their\nactivities.\nF: Do you feel at all disconnected\nfrom the student body after a year in\nthe role?\nS: If I am completely honest I feel the\nabsolute opposite.\nI think I now know an Undergraduate student in every department, have\naccess to someone in every year group\nand, due to my age, have friends doing PhDs. I even live with the first year\nstudents in Wilkinson Hall. And it\u2019s\nnot like I hide in my room and curse\ntheir untidiness. I go out for drinks with\nthem; we cook in the kitchen together;\nwatch movies and TV, etc. I even went\non the Halls trip to Belgium. And I really do find this really useful, because\nwe end up talking about their courses,\nwhat the Union does, etc. I feel like I\nunderstand more about the 1st year\ncourses than I did when I was a Fresher\nmyself.\nF: How have you delivered on your\nmanifesto points so far?\nS: One of the first things you discover\nwhen you take office is that Manifesto\npoints are easy to write but difficult to\nachieve. However I think it is fair to\nsay I did choose a large selection of\ndeliverable aims. I said from the onset that I wanted to complete a Guinness World Record, the initial thought\nbeing the World\u2019s Largest Jagertrain.\nBut as you can imagine the negative\npress, and sheer cost, that this event\ncould cause did make it decided to\nchange tack. I can, however, tell you it\nwould take 1,548 or more jagerbombs\nto win. Instead I have decided to work\nwith College Outreach to try to break\nthe more achievable \u2018World\u2019s Largest\nChemistry Lesson.\u2019Due to an irritating\nthing called the Olympics it seems this\nwill be able to plan it this year but not\ndo it until next academic year.\nAs for other pledges, if you go to the\nQuad you will now be able to withdraw cash; if you look at our finances\nyou will see that we are balancing the\nbudget and if you attend the General\nMeeting in Summer you will see me\nstriving for greater efficiency.\nWhat I would say, though, is that\nI feel confident in saying that I have\nachieved far more beneficial things for\nthe students of Imperial College than\nmy manifesto points would ever have\ndone, by doing the things I knew imagined I would do.\nF: What\u2019s an average day like in the\noffice?\nS: If there was an average day then I\nwould really query the necessity of a\nSabbatical for this role! Take today\nfor instance, I went for my fortnightly\nbreakfast with the ICSMSU President,\nhad a meeting in College, worked on a\nsurvey for PG student engagement and\nanalysed the results from the bursary\nsurvey. If I do this next week I would\ndefinitely think I was a cast member on\nthe movie Groundhog Day.\nF: Are there any aspects of the role\nwhich you feel you could\u2019ve handled\nbetter?\nS: I think it is fair to say that everyone\nwill look back at things they have done\nand criticise themselves \u2013 it\u2019s only huA year in office with the Imper\nFelix interviews Union President Scott Heath about another year of significant changes: t\nI feel confident in saying\nthat I have achieved far\nmore beneficial things\nfor the students of\nImperial College than\nmy manifesto points\nwould ever have done\n\u201cI have managed to\nincrease the representative power of\nthe Union\u201d\n\n"

Although The\nReader hardly marks the\nhighest point achieved by\nWinslet, it is nonetheless\na haunting performance,\nsomething that should\nnot have gone unnoticed.\nJulie & Julia should have\nbeen Meryl\u2019s third Oscar.\nBut no\u2026 The Academy\nvoters, loving new winners and doing almost\nanything to avoid repeat\nwinners, managed to find\nthe 2010 Best Actress\nwinner in The Blind Side\u2019s\nSandra Bullock.

    "content": "POLITICS\nFELIX Friday 02 MARCH 2012 19\nVolunteering at Tesco\nLuke Sheldon attacks the Government\u2019s new scheme as enforced labour that only benefits big companies\nW\nork experience is\nsomething most of\nus did at school.\nIt was unpaid, but\nit was two weeks\nlong and we did not do the work of paid\nstaff. Invariably we shadowed workers\nand got a chance to carry out a few of\nthe tasks. This is far from the \u201cwork\nexperience\u201d the government have been\nchampioning this week. The coalitions\nwork experience does not pay, is forced\nupon you and helps subsidise the large\ncorporations to the tune of millions.\nA Tesco advert offering \u2018Job Seekers\nAllowance plus benefits\u2019 for a night-shift worker brought these issues to attention and provoked outrage amongst\nthe general public. The coalition has\ndefended itself like a scratched CD,\nrepeating the mantra that the work experience scheme is \u201cvoluntary\u201d. This\nis wrong. Being forced to work under\nthe fear of benefit sanctions \u2013 and the\nalmost certain destitution that accompanies this \u2013 is not voluntary.\nOfficially the work experience\nscheme is \u2018voluntary\u2019 \u2013 job seekers are\nsupposed to be able to decide whether\nor not to take a placement. However,\nregularly people are pressed onto work\nexperience by the job centre and are not\ntold about the one week grace period\nwhere they can leave it without being\npunished. This is epitomized by the\ncourt case of Cat Reilly who is seeking judicial review over the work experience scheme she was enrolled on\n(it was in fact the Sector Based Work\nAcademy, but it still involves work experience and is also called \u201cvoluntary\u201d\nby the government without actually\nbeing so). She was asked to attend an\ninnocuous open day which would lead\nto a weeks training and a job interview.\nIt materialised when she attended the\nopen day that it was in fact a six week\nscheme with two weeks unpaid labour\nat Poundland. When she challenged the\nrelevance of this placement to finding\nwork she was interested in, the job centre threatened her with loss of benefits.\nNot only do the official work experience guidelines express the threat of\nsanction, causing the Citizen\u2019s Advice\nBureau to label the work experience\nscheme as \u201ccompulsory\u201d, but also, as\nshown above, the job seeker is rarely\ngiven a choice over this work experi-ence. They are bullied and harassed\nby the job centre without being told of\ntheir rights to leave the scheme within\nthe first week (or to not even start it!).\nGeorge Osborne has also indicated how\nlittle choice he believes there should\nbe by stating that he wants all people\nrefusing the work experience scheme\nto be forced onto the mandatory work\nactivity scheme, meaning \u2013 if you do\nnot choose unpaid work experience, we\nwill for you.\nCat Reilly\u2019s solicitor has remarked,\n\u201cThese Orwellian schemes are about\nwork for its own sake rather than for\nany greater purpose\u201d. I find this statement slightly misleading as work involves payment, and these placements\ndo not pay. You do up to 30 hours a\nweek for no cost to the employer with\nonly the \u00a352.50 that is Job Seekers Allowance on which to survive. This is an\nhourly rate of \u00a31.75. Seeing as a living\nwage in London is \u00a38.50 this falls far\nshort. Which is interesting, as the majority of companies providing these\nschemes are large high street stores\ndrawing multi-million pound profits\nsuch as McDonalds, Pizza Hut, Tesco\nand Asda (although HMV are looking\na bit ropey). I\u2019m sure they could find\nsome spare change to pay a living wage\nto everyone working in their stores \u2013\ninstead they pay nothing. It could be\ndeemed acceptable if it was equivalent to the work experience we did at\nschool; however it can last up to eight\nfull time weeks and invariably involves\ndoing the work that paid staff do. Cat\nReilly cleaned and stacked shelves\nalongside paid staff and last week Argos commented on their use of the government\u2019s work experience scheme by\nsaying \u201cWe can confirm thatArgos does\nnot have a policy to recruit colleagues\nthrough the governments Work Experience Programme, but [\u2026] Christmas\nis our busiest time of year and we are\npleased to provide the opportunity for\nwork experience during this time.\u201d Essentially no one doing work experience\nat Argos has a chance of a job at the\nend but they are happy to take them on\nwhen they are busy at Christmas so that\nthey do not have to pay staff overtime\nor employ temporary workers. This\nwas confirmed by a Commons committee who found evidence that companies were using the work experience\nto replace paid staff. Hugely wealthy\ncorporations are happily boosting their\nprofits by taking on free labour with no\nprospect of a job. This is exemplified\nby Tescos who boasted of the 300 people they have employed through work\nexperience, forgetting to mention this is\nonly 21% of the total work experience\nplacements they took on \u2013 a startlingly\nsmall employment rate (and evidence\nsuggests it is even smaller than this).\nDavid Cameron last week defended\nthe scheme by declaring that 50% of\npeople who did work experience were\noff Job Seeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA) after\nthree months (though not necessarily\ninto a job) and that this was the only\nway young people were going to get\ninto work. This implies that even if they\nare not employed by the company they\ndo work experience for then it helps\nthem get employed elsewhere. However figures released soon after showed\nthat 50% of jobseekers were off JSA\nafter 3 months without work experience \u2013 essentially the work experience\nmade no difference to jobseeker\u2019s job\nprospects. Not only is work experience\nthrough the job centre exploitative but\nit also does not help people into work.\nIn fact there are elements that make it\nmore difficult as forced labour does not\nlook great on the CV and working 30\nhours a week gives you less time to find\nwork...\nThe fact that this is being championed\nby the coalition as a way of combating\nyouth unemployment is ridiculous.\nYouth unemployment has been soaring\nsince the financial crisis, recently topping a million, and unless in the last five\nyears we all suddenly became lazier en\nmasse then it is fair to say that the paucity of jobs is the real issue, not young\npeople\u2019s \u2018lack\u2019 of \u2018experience\u2019. Sadly\nthese work experience placements do\nnot create a single job and in fact can\nreduce the amount of available jobs as\ncompanies replace paid work with unpaid work experience (as admitted by\nArgos above). These work experience\nplacements just make the disaster that\nis youth unemployment worse.\nThis story is not new, and in fact was\ngoing on with Labour under the guise\nof the Flexible New Deal, although the\nTories are now rolling it out at a terrifying pace. What has made it hit the\nheadlines over the past couple of weeks\nall started with one simple, now infa-mous, Tesco advert for the nightshift\nwork offering \u2018JSA plus expenses\u2019.\nThis triggered an Internet storm about\nthe abuses going on under the name of\nwork experience. The work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, has\nsince labelled critics as \u201cjob snobs\u201d for\nKFC and Starbucks this week announced apprenticeships while Burger King dropped out of the scheme last week after the backlash faced by Tesco\nlooking down on shelf-stacking as a\ncareer. Ignoring the irony of this comment coming from a wealthy Tory MP,\nit begs the question in this day and age\nof flexible labour whether now even\nasking for a wage makes you a snob.\nChris Grayling, minister for employ-ment, has also attempted to label all critics as members of the Socialist Worker\nParty (SWP), ignoring the large online\ncampaign (which involved more people\nthan the SWP have members) and the\ngrass-roots campaign group Boycott\nWorkfare involving many people who\nhave experienced forced unpaid labour\nthemselves. The strength of the opposition is reaching critical levels with the\nBoycott Workfare campaign coordinating a national day of action hitting over\n20 high streets across England, Wales,\nScotland and Northern Ireland (includ-ing Oxford Street) this Saturday (3rd\nMarch). This is beginning to have an\neffect as Waterstones, Sainsburys and\nTK Maxx have withdrawn their support for workfare schemes, along with\na number of charities, and many other\ncompanies are suspending their involvement and calling on the government to remove sanctions. Soon we\nmay be left with a government work\nexperience scheme with no work. The\ngovernment is refusing to listen to this\npressure and a collision is sure to occur\nas the government press on regardless\nwhilst the public anger builds. Hopefully this argument will help us reassess our attitude to the unemployed and\nrealise that however much unpaid work\nexperience you force people to under-take, when there are no jobs, people\nwill stay jobless.\nRajat Jain\n\u201cThe Tories are now\nrolling [the scheme]\nout at a terrifying\npace\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "The Life of Death\nI\nwas lucky enough to buy a ticket to the Malaysian Society\u2019s\nMNight long before the sales\nrush which rendered the Saturday showing sold out. It was a\ntwo-day production held in the Great\nHall, and I attended the Sunday show-ing. It was the first time I\u2019d been to\nsuch an event in my three years here,\nand my main motivation for going was\nto support one of my copy editors here\nin Felix who was on the cast. A review\nsimply had to follow.\nI took my seat with a few friends near\nthe front, reading the provided synopsis\nof The Life Of Death, directed by RayMen Chua, Alia Johari and produced\nby Sheela Ratnam and Wui Yang Ee.\nHaving taken over four months to or-ganise, the show\u2019s story was shaped as\na murder mystery, following the antics\nof a team of cops chasing after a serial\nkiller who called himself the Heartbreaker, preying on happy couples and\nleaving a heart-suited card at the scene\nof every crime, counting down from the\nKing to the Ace.\nIt was a full house, and I wasn\u2019t sure\nwhat to expect at first. When the hosts\nAhmad Mustafa and Kim Guan Yeap\nbegan their introductions, I felt like I\nwas sitting through a lengthy array of\nsponsor messages and commercials, but\ntheir banter-filled, amusingly confident\ndouble act was soundly humorous and\nserved as a satisfying warm-up.\nIt wasn\u2019t long before we were introduced to the police cast after a murder\nscene. With Clayton Qwah playing\nhairy \u2013 erm \u2013 Harry Kok, a hopeless\nromantic with a few screws loose, Carol\nAnn Cheah playing Dominique, an eager overachiever and Pak Tung Foong\nplaying Sarge, their tough commander,\nthe antics just kept coming.\nThe cast\u2019s acting was very natural,\nwith a variety of jokes peppered with\nstereotypes for additional effect. Undertones of the hopeless romantic chase\nwe all know about too well were also\npresent, giving the audience a chance\nto empathise with the characters\u2019 bold\nantics. The Heartbreaker villain\u2019s introduction brought a chilling parallel to\nthe overall mood, giving the production\na power to move the audience from an\nuproar of raucous laughter to a sorrowful mourning in seconds.\nThere were moments I felt compelled\nto sympathise with the masked Heartbreaker character/metaphor, whose\ngruff voice and pain-filled backstory\nshared similarities with Rorschach\nfrom Watchmen. The fourth wall was\nalso cleverly broken, with an unfortunate friend of mine sitting in the front\nrow feeling the brunt of this shadowy\ncharacter\u2019s voice after he stepped down\nfrom the stage and bellowed \u201cyou think\nI\u2019m a heartless killer, don\u2019t you?\u201d whilst\nwielding a very convincing dagger.\nTransitions between scenes frequently featured various dances, melding the\nplay with a systematic and welcome\nexposure to culture, including a performance of Dikir Barat, a traditional Malay musical form, hip-hop and Stomplike performances. Their choreography\nwas top notch, and they managed to\nwedge some hefty humour in there with\na troupe performing Cee-Lo Green\u2019s\n\u201cForget You\u201d using cleverly reworked\nlyrics which lightly bashed other uni-versities.\nThe interval saw the two avid hosts\nreturn with an extended effort to generate banter by exposing members of\nthe audience from other universities,\nand my unfortunate friend in the front\nrow was put under the spotlight again.\nTheir attempts to gain audience participation saw an initial reluctance to answer questions such as \u201cwhich of us is\nsexier?\u201d but it wasn\u2019t long before they\nreceived comments such as \u201cneither\u201d,\nand the banter resumed, with the hosts\ntaking it in their stride.\nThe show certainly had me in stitches\nat various points, with unexpected humour spontaneously tickling the audience\u2019s funny bones left, right and cen-tre. A clever use of the Pok\u00e9mon first\ngeneration battle music during a surprise Matrix-style fight scene complete\nwith floating hit-point indicators reig-nited waves of nostalgia across the au-dience, and hearing \u201cFIRST BLOOD!\u201d\nsound at the initial hit was the icing on\nthe cake. Such scenes appeared expertly choreographed and executed, with a\nstrategic use of strobe lights for a time\nlapse and slow motion effect making\nthe Heartbreaker\u2019s murders that much\nmore uneasy and convincing.\nThere were a few inside jokes made,\nwith members of the cast slipping into\nMalaysian slang/pidgin purposefully at\ntimes which seemed to please the parts\nof the crowd who understood, though\na translation was provided in the programme for such moments and they\nweren\u2019t too difficult to derive the meaning of.\nThe show saw a touching end, with\nthe Heartbreaker being revealed as\none of the police officers, Harry Kok,\nall along, his angst stemming from his\nfailure to be loved and his strict up-bringing. Abruptly referencing previous events where he accidentally put\nthe rest of his team in danger allowed\nus to piece together other occurrences\nwhere his stupidity could be re-evalu-ated as malice, providing the audience\nwith that all-important, yet disturbing,\npenny drop moment.\nFollowing the show\u2019s end, Nasi Lemak was provided to every ticket\nholder, and although a bit spicy, I must\nsay I really enjoyed Malaysia\u2019s national\ndish. At risk of turning this into a review more fitting in the Food section,\nI\u2019m going to sign off noting that Malaysian Night 2012 was an extraordinary\nexperience and easily the best show\nI\u2019ve seen in a while due to their sheer\ncombination of humour, emotion and\nvibrant culture. The Malaysians pulled\noff a memorable evening, taking care of\nits audience entirely along the way, and\nI\u2019m very pleased to have attended what\nwas easily the best show I\u2019ve seen for\nquite some time.\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES\nFELIX Friday 02 march 2012 41\nAlexander Karapetian takes to Malaysian Night 2012\nIt\u2019s lucky that significant arm movements are currently in fashion...\n...not to mention black clothing and contrasting headbands\nPhotos by Gene Peng\n\n"

    "content": "BOOKS\nFELIX Friday 02 march 2012 37\nHow to be a woman\nI\nhad been resisting reading this\nbook for a while. Partly because\nI have no desire to lose the meat\nand two veg, and partly because\npublishers are canny enough to\nknow their target audience and design\nthe cover accordingly. Having worked\nfor a bookshop as an undergraduate I\nalso know that the covers are as much of\na fiction as the text they are attached to.\nBut, on a day between Christmas and\nNew Year, having lost all my dignity by\nfinding myself both in a Waterstone\u2019s\nand in a provincial town, I seized the\nopportunity to satisfy my curiosity.\nAnd I was pleased I did. There were\nenough words I do not know for me\nto listen, without alienating me. There\nwere jokes on every page and it was en-gaging. There is an observational and\narticulate person behind the text who is\nable to get their point across cleanly. It\nwas a good read, I was hooked. Perhaps this is why I found a lot of the\nbook so disappointing. I did not want\nto dislike it, but as it got so decidedly\noff-centre in places, I could not help but\nfeel let down.\nI suppose what I should do is go and\nwrite a book myself, and have it pub-lished, and use that as my response.\nBut of course the world does not work\nlike that. This book is a product, to be\nsold. And this one has been, and even\nto me. Does it help that the writer is\nboth pretty and intelligent? Probably.\nBut it is also because it is what people\nwant. So, I make the following argu-ments, in the style of the author herself,\nboth as a list and with some trepidation:\n1) Sexism is not what you describe,\nCaitlin Moran. Yes there are wank-ers who leer suggestively and tastelessly and their behaviour undermines a\nwoman\u2019s self-confidence, and of course\nthat is about as acceptable as arbitrarily\nchopping bits off people. However, it\nhas almost nothing to do with the recipient of such behaviour. The reason\nit happens is because there is a stupid\nperson (in this case, a man) who does\nnot understand what happens to him\nwhen he sees a woman. All he can do\nis respond in a way that suggests quite\nstrongly he has no idea what he looks\nlike. Added to which, the reason why\ntelling men, or even making it unacceptable for them to behave like that,\nhas not worked, is because the underlying problem has not been solved. There\nwill always be wankers.\n2) Men do not have all the power or\nall the influence. The world just does\nnot work like that, and probably never\nhas. Needless to say it is only comparatively recently that women have been\nin posts or offices that are considered\npowerful, but that is really not the same\nthing as becoming more influential.\n3) I have often thought that women\nare judged more on how they look than\nmen are, and men are judged more on\nwhat they have than women are. There\nare a variety of tedious arguments about\nwhether this is nature or nurture, but\none point that is rarely made is that we\nare judged on what it is we care about: I\nam judged as a scientist because I want\nto be one. There would be no point in\njudging someone as a florist if they say\nthey want to be a mechanical engineer.\nThat is why a woman might take longer\nchoosing a for a night out and her boyfriend will not really give a hoot. And\nall he wants from her shoes is for them\nto be pavement-worthy. Equally, men\noften do just the same thing about mon-ey, influence or intellectual standing.\nThey may become obsessed with a promotion and pay rise, the latter of maybe\nnot even 10% of their current salary. If\nthey get it, their other half is not going\nto love them more. But he will still go\nfor that promotion and the extra cash,\nhe is motivated for it. Both women and\nmen have similarly false connections, it\ndoes not make either gender worth less.\nWhat is lacking from this book is an\nunderstanding of human nature, of what\nis alike about men and women. If this\nwere injected it would help tell us how\nthings may be judged intellectually.\nBlaming men, sorry, \u201cthe patriarchy\u201d\nfor one\u2019s own perceived shortcomings,\nand in an off-centre way, achieves noth-ing. But, as I say, it is a book made for\nselling.\nSome of the best science fiction you\u2019ll ever read\nOrson Scott Card\u2019s Ender\u2019s Game is\nwidely regarded as one of the greatest classics of the science fiction\ngenre but I didn\u2019t get round to reading it until last summer. Having read\nit, I have to say that the hype was\nfully justified and that it is, in fact,\none of the best science fiction books\nthat I have ever read. While it may\nbe a clich\u00e9 to say so, I was really\nhooked from the first page and was\nleft wanting more after I\u2019d finished.\nThe novel focuses on Andrew\n\u2018Ender\u2019 Wiggin, the result of a selective breeding programme which\nmeans that, despite his preteen age\nat the start of the book, he is exceptionally mature and intelligent.\nIt follows his training at the orbital Battle School as he is trained\nto lead Earth\u2019s International Fleet\nagainst invasion from the insec-toid Formics, which have attempted\nto attack the planet twice before.\nThe universe of the novel is richly\ndetailed and believable. While the\nmain focus of the book is on Ender, the\npolitical situation on Earth, explored\nthrough both the actions of Ender\u2019s\nequally intelligent siblings, Peter\nand Valentine, and the interactions\nof his superior at the Battle School,\nColonel Graff, with his colleagues,\nforms a fascinating backdrop that\nis vital in understanding why Ender\nis put through the trials that he is.\nWhile it may be a small point, I\nparticularly liked the Greek titles\nof Hegemon, used for the leader\nof the unified Earth, and Strategos and Polemarch, used for the\nleaders of the International Fleet.\nWhile this doesn\u2019t really affect the\nstory it does give the book an interesting and unusual flavour and\ndoes somewhat help it to stand out.\nThe real achievement of Ender\u2019s\nGame, however, are its characters.\nEvery one of the main players in\nSamuel Furse takes a critical look at a highly praised feminist work\nMaciej Matuszewski the book is very well developed.\nIt\u2019s saying something that I\u2019m hard\npressed to call anybody in the book,\neven the initially sinister Graff, a\nvillain. In the end the novel comes\noff as an exploration of the tragic\nconsequences that can result from\na lack of communication. I\u2019d like\nto say more, but I\u2019m afraid that it\nwould spoil the fantastic ending.\nI have heard some complain that\nthey find it hard to believe that a\ncharacter as young as Ender could\nbe so skilled and intelligent. I personally don\u2019t find this too much of a\nproblem \u2013 I\u2019m perfectly happy to accept the explanation of the selective\nbreeding programme. I also think that\nthis is a part of the story that is very\nnecessary, with the youth element\n\u201cEnder\u2019s Game is, in\nmany ways, close to\nperfect\u201d\nA look back at Ender\u2019s Game \u2013 Orson Scott Card\u2019s first great masterpiece\nbeing crucial to the theme of lost\ninnocence having as much of an impact as it does. I certainly don\u2019t think\nthat many seasoned science fiction\nreaders will have much trouble suspending their disbelief on this point.\nI would thoroughly encourage\neveryone to read this book. It is, in\nmany ways close to perfect. Indeed\nafter reading it I held off from looking at any of the sequels or prequels,\nknowing how much weaker sequels\ncan devalue a brilliant original (I\u2019m\nlooking at you, Dune). I have, how-ever, just picked up Speaker for the\nDead, the next book in the series.\nI\u2019ve heard good things about it and\nthe fact is that even if it\u2019s a fraction of the quality of Ender\u2019s Game,\nit\u2019s going to be a brilliant book.\n\u201cI did not want to\ndislike it, but ... I\ncould not help but\nfeel let down\u201d\nCaitlin Moran is an acclaimed broadcaster and columnist at The Times\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBooks Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\n\n"

    "content": "ACADEMY AWARDS SPECIAL\nFELIX Friday 02 MARCH 2012 33\nCongratulations are in order for Meryl Streep - she finally, FINALLY has that third Oscar. She had to wait almost thirty years and pitch in countless outstanding performances to win last Sunday for The Iron Lady. Before\nthis she had lost a staggering 14 times. Felix Film looks at previous Academy Award winners responsible for\nStreep\u2019s losing streak\nJodie Foster\u2019s roaring\ncomeback as a legitimate\nadult star kicked off with\nher Oscar-winning role in\nThe Accused. She was a\nsuccessful child star, and\nlike many in the indus-try, initially struggled to\nmake the transition with\nseveral flimsy adult roles.\nBut The Accused was\nthe start of a new phase\nin this brilliant actress\u2019\ncareer. So there is very\nlittle to be disappointed\nwith, and yes, she did go\non to beat Streep\u2019s performance in A Cry in the\nDark. But in all fairness,\nFoster\u2019s raw portrayal\nof a rape victim simply\noutclassed all the fellow\nnominees in the Best Actress race of 1989.\nKathy Bates was a late\nbloomer in the business,\nfirst getting serious recognition for a role she\nlanded aged 40+. But it\u2019s\nbetter late than never,\nas her terrifying Annie\nWilkes of Stephen King\u2019s\nMisery, a delusional psychopath who decides to\nimprison her favourite\nauthor of all time, earned\nher a handful of awards,\nincluding an Oscar in\n1991. Competing once\nagain in the tough Best\nActress category was\nStreep, perhaps in one of\nher weaker, lighter roles\nwith Postcards from the\nEdge. The one thing she\ndid prove here was that\nshe could also belt out a\ntune live on stage.\nThere were three strong\ncontenders in 1996.\nEmma Thompson (Sense\nand Sensibility), the good\nold Meryl (The Bridges of\nMadison County) and the\none who actually walked\naway with the gong, Susan Sarandon, for her\ndeeply touching performance in Dead Man\nWalking. Even the convicted killer played to\nfierce perfection by Sean\nPenn was eventually\nmoved by her warmth,\nand it\u2019s in Sarandon\u2019s\nSister Helen that the film\nfinds its spiritual core.\nThe devastating finale is\nas painful as it is beauti-ful, thanks largely to the\nveteran actress\u2019 faultless\nperformance.\nA lot of people look back\non Shakespeare in Love\nand think whether it was\nreally worth all that hype\nand award love. Given\nthe strong competition\nit faced from superior\nwar films (Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red\nLine), the intelligently\nwritten, wonderfully lavish costume drama was\nprobably ever-so slightly\noverrated. More controversial was Gwyneth\nPaltrow\u2019s Oscar triumph\nin 1999. Just by direct\ncomparison, Streep gives\na heart-breaking turn as\na cancer-ridden mother\nin One True Thing whilst\nPaltrow plays dress-up to\nproudly stand on stage to\nact. Embarrassing.\nNot Streep\u2019s finest hour\nthis \u2013 she did take an\nintense crash course in\nlearning to play the violin for Music of the Heart\nwhich did get her an\nOscar nomination and\nrightfully, nothing further\nhappened. 2000 was instead a dramatic showdown between Annette\nBening (American Beauty) and Hilary Swank\n(Boys Don\u2019t Cry). Playing\na darker, more twisted\ncharacter is always a\nsafe bet if you want to\nwin an Oscar, as evidenced by Swank\u2019s win\nfor playing a girl playing\na boy (or was it the other\nway around?). Either way,\nbravo Hilary, for a truly\nremarkable performance.\n\n"

No need to apologise\n\u2014 I know you missed me. I would miss me\ntoo. Who wouldn\u2019t?\nContinuing with the series of answering any\nand all of your questions, Jimmy writes: \u201cI\u2019ve\nhad the ambition to start an institute of questionable (evil) science. Research would be focused on chemical weapons, zombie plagues,\nmutations, tentacle grafts, hegemonic nano-swarms, 20,000-ton tanks with laser cannons,\nand giant stompy robots. As an experienced\nscience practitioner, how would you go about\nsetting up such an institution?\u201d\nUntouchable\nhttp://www.newgrounds.com/portal/\nview/590784\nOH SWEET MERCY IT\u2019S A SHARK OH GODS OH\nGODS OH GODS SAVE MCalm down, it\u2019s only a virtual shark. But hell, this\nvirtual shark can cause obscene amounts of property and personal damage.\nLive the dream of every red-blooded male and\npilot a shark rampaging through New York city,\ncausing death and destruction everywhere you go.\nBring down planes, smash cruise liners to pieces,\nbehead King Kong (seriously) and make canoeists\nyour midday snack.\nIt\u2019s fun, simple, crazy action and well worth at\nleast one playthrough.\nUntouchable is very reminiscent of bullet hell games,\nexcept with a slightly more manageable amount of\nbullets and a variety of projectiles. And slowdown\nability. And powerups. OK, so it\u2019s more of a retro-shooter than anything.\nStill, Untouchable is pretty fun to play. You pilot a\nsmall bullet-spewing ship against a variety of pixely\nenemies. By the second boss you have to manage\nyour limited slowdown power carefully, with bullets\nand all sorts of missiles and electrical strikes flying\nall over the place. Frustrating fun for all the family.\nThat is, if they\u2019re into online flash games of course.\nFELIX\nFriday 02 march 2012\n36\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nGames Editor: Laurence Pope\nGAMES\nFree Web Games\nDespite last week\u2019s absence, Felix Games hasn\u2019t\nbeen cancelled, so put away the balloons and party\npoppers. Instead, drown your sorrows with these\ntwo totally awesome web games that you can play\nright now in your web browser. In order to enjoy\nthese you\u2019re going to need the Adobe Flash Player\nplug-in, which can be installed from http://get.\nadobe.com/flashplayer/\nNew York Shark\nhttp://www.newgrounds.com/portal/\nview/590705\nThere\u2019s no point in beating around the bush\nJimmy \u2014 you want to be an evil scientist. We\nall do at some point, but it takes guts and determination to admit it and get the ball rolling \u2014 we could do with an ambitious boy like\nyou in the lab. Actually, scratch that, I could\ndo with a hundred of you \u2014 lately, the boys in\nthe lab haven\u2019t been working as hard as usual.\nI think they\u2019re planning a mutiny. Well, that or\nthey\u2019re getting more stupid. We\u2019ve got a new\ncloning process in the works, so if you don\u2019t\nmind, we\u2019ll take some of your blood, fiddle\nwith your DNA and stick it in some bacteria.\nWith any luck, we\u2019ll get a duplicate version\nof your fine self. We\u2019ve found that upon creation of your twin, one of you is undoubtedly\nevil, but we\u2019ve yet to work out which one.\nThe legal suits say I also need to mention\nthat the side effects may include having an\narch-nemesis, a clich\u00e9d storyline for the rest\nof your life and being incarcerated for crimes\nyour clones committed. The boys in the lab\nspent days calculating that if you have a single\nclone and one of you is evil, then if we make\n99 clones, 50 of you are going to be evil. At\nthe moment we\u2019re not exactly sure what it is\nthat makes people evil, but we think it might\nbe something to do with facial hair. A surprising number of our clones come grown with a\nvariety of goatees and long, thin moustaches.\nAnyway, if we find a way to separate the good\nones from the evil ones, then we\u2019ll ship your\nevil clones to you, free of charge.\nI could start with mentioning that those of\nyou who are studying at Imperial but intend to\njoin the plague of bankers that impede scientific progress, are the real evil scientists, but\nI won\u2019t. I\u2019m above that. Unlike them. I could\nalso mention those people over at Black Mesa\nwho steal ideas and government funding, but\nthen they\u2019re not even scientists. They\u2019re more\nakin to fish. Plus, I\u2019ve a court order that says\nI must stop slandering those treacherous thug-fish. Like hell I will!\nAnyway, on your quest towards international domination, there\u2019s nothing more important than location, location, location. You\ncan\u2019t have a proper base of operations living\nin your parent\u2019s basement. Before rushing out\nto your local real estate agents however, there\nare a few things I would bear in mind when\nlooking for an inner sanctum. You want a site\nwhere you can test in peace and quiet, have\nvery few witnesses, and yet still be able to \u2018invite\u2019test subjects to your facilities. In addition\nto this, it sounds like a lot of your projects will\ntake up a lot of space. I would look to invest in\na large space, adjoining your initial domain,\nwhich you can move into when needed.\nOnce you\u2019ve started your testing and have\nsome working prototypes, I would suggest\nthat you go and make a name for yourself.\nGo and cause a few disappearances around\nyour local towns, start rumours, or test some\nof your projects on the unsuspecting public.\nThe suits over in legal are now telling me to\npoint out that I am in no way speaking from\nexperience. Potential buyers, and those you\nhold to ransom won\u2019t take you seriously until you have proven yourself. If the label of\nevil scientist ruffles your feathers, then another well-trodden route is that of the good\nold-fashioned American super-villain. You\u2019ll\nhave to come up with a name, and maybe even\na catchphrase to get those gals swooning over\nyou. And remember, unless you\u2019ve got a PhD,\nin your line of work, people won\u2019t fear you.\nMr Doom sounds like a kindergarten teacher.\nA foreign one.\nThere\u2019s not much point having a nice place\nwith enough room for an army of whooping\nterriers when you\u2019re stranded in the middle\nof nowhere. Like Canada. Without adequate\ntransport links or abundant natural resources,\nyour plans will grind to a halt. Late colleagues\nof mine, who had the same aspirations as you\ndo, ended up moving to Siberia to conduct research into using bears as cavalry. They ended\nup running out of toothpaste, which led to\nwidespread rioting and the release of grizzly\nbears with IQs over 150 into the wild. Obviously.\nSomething most young people don\u2019t seem\nto think about either are the operating costs\nof running an empire, as it were. Having a lair\nthat\u2019s able to exploit natural resources is key\nto keeping your giant stompy robots stomp-ing, be it geothermal or hamster-wheel ener-gy, large amounts of precious metals or even a\ncity of mole-men. Whatever you don\u2019t have to\npay for makes your life easier.\nFinally, there\u2019s the motivation to see your\nvision come true. There\u2019s no such thing as\naiming too high when it comes to science,\nonly being afraid of missing your target. We\nnormally have to keep on playing pre-record-ed messages for our test subjects to keep them\nmotivated to reach the end. It looks like you\nwant to see this through till the end, so at least\nI don\u2019t have to mail you the pre-recorded\ntapes of me shouting at you to get on with it.\nAny problems with those projects of yours,\nand I\u2019ll be glad to help. As always, if you have\nany questions for me, then Caroline is waiting\nto take your telegrams. Cave out.\n\u201cI can see the family resemblance - he\u2019s got Aunt Gertrude\u2019s plasmids\u201d\nQuestions for Cave?\nDo you have any questions for Mr\nJohnson? If so, email them onto\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk and I\u2019ll\npass them onto him for answers.\nResponses will be published in Felix.\nSo go do as the man says people.\nWrite in \u2013 for science.\n\n"

Don\u2019t be too\nhasty, don\u2019t turn the page, don\u2019t \u2018Command + T\u2019\naway: there\u2019s redemption at the end of this article.\nHe was playing at the beautiful Cecil Sharp\nHouse in Camden. It\u2019s a regal building first opened\nin 1930 and the home of the English Folkdance\nand Song Society. My friend had invited me believing that Perfume Genius would be, in his words,\n\u201cright down my street\u201d. I used to spend a lot of\ntime on folk road, with the likes of Laura Marling\nand Mumford & Sons, so he had good reason to\ntrust in his judgement. Unfortunately he hadn\u2019t realised that I\u2019d converted the road into a shared\nspace full of electronic ambient music \u2013 Perfume\nGenius\u2019 wistful piano laments fell onto disinterested ears. I left the gig fully enjoying explaining\nto my friend that \u201cnah man, just not into that kind\nof thing as much anymore\u201d.\nThe memory of that night quickly disappeared\nfrom my mind, until last week. I was scrambling\naround for a suitable \u2018Album of the Week\u2019 after I\nwas told that Burial\u2019s new three-track EP \u201cdidn\u2019t\ncount as an album\u2019. (I still recommend you check it\nout \u2013 it\u2019s called Kindred). Thus I came across Put\nYour Back N 2 It on Pitchfork\u2019s website. When the\nfirst note struck me, and his hurt-drenched voice\nemerged, I felt winded.\nMemories of Cecil Sharp House flooded to the\nfront of my mind. Of course the songs on this al-bum, Mike Hadreas\u2019 second, are not the same\nthat he performed then \u2013 but what at the time felt\nobnoxious has now grown into such careful and\nunimpeachable sensitivity.\nPerfume Genius writes unashamedly introspective music. He sings, with a voice heavy with\nheartache, lyrics like \u201cHold my hand, I am afraid.\nPlease pray for me, When I am away\u201d. But I urge\nyou not to dismiss it as I was so foolish to do at\nCecil Sharp House. Pay attention and you\u2019ll find\nthat this isn\u2019t whinging \u2013 it\u2019s an exploration of his\ninner-self. You feel like you\u2019re walking through the\ndark caverns of his heart, shining your flash light\nat the cave-drawings on the walls \u2013 not knowing\nexactly how you came to that spot and where you\u2019ll\nemerge into the light again.\nWell, I suppose that\u2019s enough metaphor for one\nweek \u2013 take your time with this one, choose the\nright time to listen to it.\nIf you think my use of metaphor was a bit over the\ntop this week, tweet \u201cLet\u2019s have less of the fancy\nflower arrangements next week!\u201d @kadhimshubber.\nAlternatively, tweet a virtual hug @perfumegenius,\nand let him know it\u2019ll all be ok, one day.\nMusic Editors: \u00cd\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez de Rituerto\nAlex Ramadan\nsynth and vocals is beautiful, and then \u2018Your\nLips Are Red\u2019. It\u2019s probably my favourite St.\nVincent track on record, and the rearranged\nlive version is even better. It\u2019s a fantastic end\nto a fantastic gig. It\u2019s by far the best gig I\u2019ve\nbeen to this year, and I really can\u2019t imagine it\nbeing beaten. Top notch.\nming the chorus riff most of the way home.\n\u2018Strange Mercy\u2019 is the best song about police\nbrutality in the history of the Universe (sorry\nN.W.A.) and \u2018Marrow\u2019, whilst introduced as\na \u2018dance song\u2019, is her at her most angry and\nintense and works really well. The encore is\nfantastic. \u2018The Party\u2019 stripped down to just one\nI\nam 110% in love with Annie Clark, of\nSt. Vincent. That means I could backtrack 10% and still be completely in\nlove with her. The woman knows her\nway around a guitar and what more do\nyou need? The live tone is sensational, probably the best I\u2019ve ever heard, and it suits her\nmanic little riffs absolutely perfectly. The solos (and there are plenty) seem essential to the\nmessage of the songs instead of the normal\nego-inflating wankery. The atmosphere of it\nebbs and flows and it never gets close to dull.\nThe rest of the band does their job, but it is\nall about Annie Clark. Tonight\u2019s gig is her biggest ever UK headline show but that doesn\u2019t\nseem to faze her. She runs the stage. Her whole\nperformance is just captivating. After one\nsong I noticed the drummer picking up drums,\nbut I have absolutely no idea how they were\nknocked over, because I couldn\u2019t take my eyes\noff Annie Clark.\nThe setlist is complete gold. A front three of\n\u2018Surgeon\u2019, \u2018Cheerleader\u2019 and \u2018Chloe in the Afternoon\u2019 is just unstoppable, and the huge grin\nthey produce never leaves my face throughout\nthe show. \u2018Actor Out of Work\u2019has always been\na masterpiece and that doesn\u2019t change in the\nlive arena, whilst she manages to make me fall\nin love with a track I was never a big fan of\nin \u2018Dilettante\u2019.

Mixing electro with\nfunk while sampling everything from classical choral pieces to grungy guitar riffs means\nevery track is a total diversion from the last.\nWhile this works for most numbers, some\n(notably \u2018General Patton\u2019) end up just too ob-scure.

The Kindle is a brilliant improvement \u2013 economically and environmentally \u2013 to the age-old book; howev-er, it also means the extinction of notes\nin the margins, and small second hand\nbookshops \u2013 such things that, by untold\npowers, manage to transport us back in\ntime to another place, another age.\nWoody Allen\u2019s latest film Midnight in\nParis deals with a similar theme. Gil,\nthe protagonist, has romantic fantasies\nof Paris in the 1920\u2019s. He envisions\nnarrow alleyways and small cafes humming with jazz and rife with musicians,\nartists and writers from all around the\nworld. Allen calls it golden age think-ing. Gil struggles with the trade-off\nbetween the charm of the past and the\nutility of the future. Paris of the past has\nMaxim\u2019s, streetcars, and candle-lit al-leyways, but what they don\u2019t have is e-mail, electricity, and antibiotics. Since\nthe advent of the information revolution\nwe have seen the birth of the Internet,\nthe television, the phone, the mobile\nphone, the hands-free phone, Skype,\nthe iPod, YouTube, cars that can park\nthemselves, and \u2013 arguably more significantly \u2013 a score of new vaccines.\nWe\u2019ve reached Mars and even managed\nto increase the average life expectancy\nto nearly 80 years in most developed\ncountries.\nHowever, the sustainability of the\nthings that matter to us is inevitably\nquestioned by innovation. These are\ndifferent things for different people. For\nme it is vinyl records and old cinemas.\nFor my father it is the Sunday edition of\nthe morning newspaper. For my grandmother I suspect it has something to do\nwith the cordial chitchat between her\nand the postman. But these are only incidental charms on an individual scale.\nWhat about those larger things that\nmatter so much to so many? Is religion\nsustainable in the face of scientific dis-covery? When subjected to the rigor of\nthe scientific method, do the foundations on which so many faiths are based\nmaintain their integrity? How about\nthose whose doctrines specifically preclude the possibility of evolution\u2014an\nidea whose certainty is imminent? How\nabout our privacy? Yes, we will probably get healthier and live longer. Root\ncanals, prostate exams and other unsavory medical probings will become less\nuncomfortable. Our world is getting\nbetter, but we have to wonder, what are\nthe trade-offs? If only Dickens were\nhere to give his view of our own changing modern times.\nThe Dickens Exhibition at the Museum of London is on display until\nJune 2012.\navarice of the monopolising spirit, and\nthe gradual extinction of many of the\ncherished charms of the city (some of\nwhich are now on display in the exhibi-tion).Although in part a boon to society,\nindustrialization had its drawbacks\u2014it\nthreatened the quaint, but susceptible\ncharacter of the city that Dickens so\nadmired.\nThere is a theme of resistance weaved\nthroughout the history of innovation.\nGoogle the societal context of a given\nbreakthrough innovation and you will\nmost likely find some sort of backlash.\nA dramatic example of resistance to\nchange is the scientific dark ages, when\nthinkers and innovators were burned at\nthe stake for rattling the comfortable\nworld-view of society (and, of course,\nfor threatening the reallocation of pow-er). But less extreme examples abound,\nsuch as the resistance to the spinning\njenny, or to Darwin\u2019s theory of evolu-tion.\nSo, we return again to our question:\nhow do we explain Dickens\u2019 mixed-feelings about the changes taking place\nin his era? Ben Franklin said upon ratifying the constitution: \u201cthere are several\nparts\u2026about which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall\nnever approve them.\u201d My suspicion is\nthat Dickens had a similar ambivalence\ntowards the innovations of his day\u2014\nhopeful for the future, but hesitant\nabout marching without reflection into\na brave new world.\nToday we similarly must wonder\nabout the seeds of change being sown\nby the information revolution. What are\nthe trade-offs associated with a \u201cbetter\u201d\n\u201cHow do we explain\nDickens\u2019 mixed feelings about the changes taking place...?\u201d\n\u201c(Dickens) was hesitant about marching\nwithout reflection into\na brave new world \u201d\n\n"

    "content": "the characters. Will de Renzy-Martin\ncaptures Skilling\u2019s character perfectly,\nprojecting the image of a driven, un-apologetic businessman to great effect.\nAlongside Skilling stand his business\npartners, quirky financial officer Andy\nFastow (played by Al Norman) and ENRON CEO Ken Lay (Dominic Wood),\nas well as the fictional female executive\nClaudia Roe (played by the very non-fictional Grace Surman).\nThe play is certainly quirky, with\n\u2018two Velociraptor heads with glowing\neyes\u2019 and \u2018a ventriloquist\u2019s dummy\u2019 being part of the props list. If that wasn\u2019t\nenough to entice you, an energetic\ndance number with ENRON traders set\nto remixed Matrix music should do the\ntrick. The synchronisation between the\nactors is almost spot on; given another\nweek of practice and it\u2019ll certainly be an\naudience pleaser.\nARTS\nFELIX Friday 02 MARCH 2012 27\nEnrontoawinner\nLast week I requested a gilded invitation to see DramSoc\u2019s latest spring term\nplay ENRON before it went on stage.\nWhilst I did get my invite I didn\u2019t get\nit on gold leaf coated paper, the stingy\ngits. In spite of this I went to see the\ncast perform on Tuesday, with no idea\nwhat to expect, despite everything I\u2019d\nheard about both ENRON the company\nand ENRON the West End production.\nAs it turned out, I was pretty impressed.\nENRON isn\u2019t a company many people seemed to have heard of, so a brief\nhistory lesson may be required. ENRON was a large Texan energy company that went bankrupt in 2001, following a massive scandal that caused\nENRON shares to drop like a stone,\ncosting thousands of people their life\nsavings and jobs. The play, originally\nwritten by Brit playwright Lucy Prebble, principally revolves around Jeff\nSkilling, ENRON\u2019s former president,\nand his role and attitude towards his\ncompany\u2019s fall.\nAs someone who can\u2019t make head\nor tail of the Financial Times I was a\nlittle worried when I sat down to watch.\nWould this be worth my time, or would\nI quickly regret my decision not to sit at\nhome and watch paint dry? Thankfully\nit was the former. Whilst finance does\ninevitably crop up here or there it\u2019s not\nthe focal point of the play \u2013 that would\nbe the interaction and development of\nOne initial niggling concern was\nabout the accents; as Skilling first\nopened his mouth I admit I expected\nsomething rather cringe worthy. Those\nexpectations were indeed wrong. Perhaps it was a little unusual hearing such\naccents to begin with, but none stood\nout as being absolutely terrible. If any-thing, by the end of the play some people were sounding far too British.\nOnce more DramSoc manages to im-press. When combined with a proper\nset, costumes, lights, sounds and visuals I hope that that the first ever amateur\nproduction of ENRON will succeed just\nas well as the company it\u2019s named after.\nWell, at least before its bankruptcy...\nEnron shows from 7 \u2013 10 March,\nUnion Concert Hall. Tickets are\non sale now: \u00a35 students, \u00a37 non-students.\nWhat starts off as the kind of play you\nthink will predominantly explore the\nextremes to which political correctness is taken \u2013 sometimes creating\njust the awkwardness and indignity it\nhopes to avoid \u2013 changes course and\nends up shining a very cynical light on\nthe soulless and business-only orientated nature of today\u2019s entertainment\nbusiness.\nSignal Theatre\u2019s \u2013 a young Chicago\ncompany \u2013 A Place at the Table\u2019s dialogue is solid and slick. Yet these brilliant little moments are overwhelmed\nby the long-winded exchanges that go\ninto much too much detail about the\nins and outs of how the Biz operates\n\u2013 rather too much to take on board for\nthe average punter who only watches\nTV\u2026 and even a bit too much for\nsomeone who works somewhere in the\nbusiness (yours truly).\nGood job the cast of four was vibrant\nenough to keep us interested, each actor a delight to watch regardless of\nwhether the script was going through\none of its momentary lulls. Christopher Tester is confident and natural as\n\u201cthe disabled playwright\u201d Adam, with\na great Benedict Cumberbatch-esque\nvoice, too. Someone you would think\nhas years of acting experience already\nbehind him.\nKellie Batchelor \u2013 one of the company\u2019s founders \u2013 proves she can play\nboth the screeching chav (I last saw\nher as the village bicycle Cherry in\nAnthony Nielson\u2019s The Night Before\nChristmas), as well as the more yummy\nmummy end of the spectrum as Sarah\nthe TV executive who starts off wanting to change the world with Adam\u2019s\nDisabled sitcom, only to turn into just\nanother figures-obsessed media whore.\nJacob Dunn has tremendous presence\nand energy as Sammy.

The three\nmen in their make-shift lounge dance\nbetween light-hearted, ludicrous and\ndownright disturbingly macabre tales,\nand it doesn\u2019t matter whether the tales\nbeing told are true or not. The audience\nis absorbed and captivated by their de-livery, as much as the content. In fact it\njust so happens that most of these anecdotes are, at least in part, true.\nWhat I Heard About the World is more\nthan just the black box studio being the\nmodern analogue to the minstrel. The\nmanner in which the stories are told matters as much their content. Amusing idiocy and a touch of light-hearted humour\nis used to defuse the grim and an air of\ngravitas and sincerity to disarm the hilarious and outright bizarre. With this,\ninterest never wavers and the edge is\ntaken off the initial reaction and with the\ndeliberately imprecise retelling of the\nstories, a more open-minded approach\ncan be taken with reflecting on how the\nworld and societies we aren\u2019t familiar\nwith are perceived.

    "content": "The once distinct lines between fact and science\nfiction are getting increasingly blurred almost\non a daily basis. This month, it\u2019s biology taking the lead. The Wyss Institute, a department\ncommitted to Biologically Inspired Engineering\nat Harvard University, recently unveiled its first\never cellular robot. It could be little to no time\nbefore these miniature machines are flowing\nthrough your body as they look to be the big\nplayers in medicine for the future.\nScientists in the US are currently developing these DNA nanorobots. They are based on\nthe concept of \u2018DNA Origami,\u2019 initially put\nforward by Paul Rothemund from Caltech in\n2006. By manipulating DNA, the usual, regular\ndouble helix structure is split down the middle,\nand then, using the specific bonding of the base\npairs, turned into complex 2D or 3D forms by\ntwisting DNA over itself in various ways.\nAt the Wyss institute, they have managed to\nbuild complex structures using the split DNA\nstrands, producing the microscopic models that\ncan self-assemble quickly and be modified to\nexecute specific tasks. In only six short years,\nDNA manipulation has gone from simple 2D\nstructures to structures that could tour your\nbloodstream, seek out target cells, and even deliver them a lethal blow to kill them completely.\nThe nanorobot itself has a basic barrel structure that splits laterally and is hinged by double stranded DNA motifs, which can recognize\ncell surface receptors \u2013 cellular nametags that\nindicate the type of cell. The molecule it can\ndeliver is attached inside the barrel and once\nthe double stranded motifs recognize the receptors they bind to them, causing them to\nchange shape, forcing the barrel to open and\nreleasing the molecule. The binding of the receptor to the nanorobot directly ensures specificity so they only deliver to the cell they are\ndesigned to target.\nDNA nanorobots have displayed significant\nsuccesses, recognising leukaemia cells out of\na mixed cell sample, for example, showing the\npotential for them to be used to treat cancer\nin the future. Furthermore, they could do this\nwithout the damaging side effects of chemotherapy and without killing healthy cells, as\nthe nanorobots cannot recognise healthy cells\nif designed correctly.\nSo what lies ahead for these petite pioneers\nof our blood vessels? At the minute, they are\nstill being tested in vitro, and whether or not\nthey work in living tissue is yet to be seen. One\nissue is that the body\u2019s own defence mechanisms could eradicate the tiny machines before\nthey even get to their target tissue; the liver has\nThe nanorobots are coming\nIs it just me or do these look like hammocks?\nbeen found to clear them and they are susceptible to degradation by enzymes called nucle-ases, that destroy unwanted DNA strands as\npart of the cellular housekeeping process.\nHowever, if these issues are overcome, they\ncould provide a level of target specificity and\ndrug delivery efficiency that could never be\nachieved using conventional drugs, along with\nbeing the potential first steps to better cancer\ntreatments. These tiny creations could be the\nbasis of a new generation of therapeutic treat-ments, and could revolutionise how we use\ndrugs in the future. It could only be a matter of\ntime before your blood becomes one complex\nhighway for these tiny tearaways.\nThe origin of life on Earth is one of the most\ncompelling questions in science today. Recently, hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor have\nbeen cited as potential settings for this event.\nHowever, the Proceedings of the National\nAcademy of Sciences has published a study led\nby Armen Mulkidjanian from the University of\nOsnabr\u00fcck, Germany, arguing that the first life\narose in pools of condensed vapour from geothermal vents on land.\nNearly 4 billion years ago the \u2018late heavy\nbombardment\u2019 saw Earth\u2019s surface pulverised\nby asteroids, leaving few rocks intact. This\nwas bad luck for scientists, as the earliest life\nprobably existed before then \u2013 so we will never discover its fossils. Consequently, scientists\nare trying to picture those organisms from the\nbiological, not fossil, record: finding features\nthat all living cells share, because they probably also occurred in our most ancient ances-tors, or \u2018protocells\u2019.\nThe Canadian biochemist Archibald Macallum pointed out in 1926 that, while our blood\nresembles seawater, the insides of our cells do\nnot. They contain much higher concentrations\nof certain metal ions and phosphate than are\n(or ever were) present in oceans, but less so-dium, which they constantly pump out. Our\ncells control these concentrations with \u2018iontight\u2019 membranes and transporter proteins,\nbut protocells had not yet evolved these. Ions\nwould have flowed through them and reached\nthe same concentrations as in the surrounding\nwater.\nMulkidjanian\u2019s team looked among the old-est, most conserved proteins in many organisms for those which require particular ions.\nThey found that potassium and zinc are involved in the most ancient, basic processes,\nsuch as protein and DNA synthesis, while sodium ions are not. Meanwhile, phosphate fills\nthe backbone of every DNA molecule and is\npresent on many proteins. These features of\nevery modern cell were probably present in\nprotocells too. However, no known or reconstructed marine environment has a high potas-sium-to-sodium ratio, making hydrothermal\nvents unpromising as potential cradles of life.\nThe authors put forward an alternative setting for the beginning of life: pools formed\nof condensed steam from geothermal springs.\nWhen magma-heated water rises from deep\nunderground, some evaporates, carrying with\nit lots of potassium, phosphate and zinc but\nvery little sodium. It also contains organic\nmolecules and ammonia, which cells can use\nfor energy or synthesis. Additionally, the exuded sulphides probably solidified into porous\nstructures that could protect protocells from\nthe sun\u2019s harmful UV rays.\nDOI: 10.1073/pnas.1117774109\nEliot Barford\nFELIX\nFriday 02 March 2012\n14\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nSCIENCE\nIn brief\nPhilippa Skett\nA research team from institutions around Europe and Australia have published an article that\ncomes to the mind-blowing conclusion that some\nlarge organisms still alive today can be thousands\nof years old.\nThe group, led by Sophie Arnaud-Haond, concentrated mainly on clonal organisms; organisms\nwith the same genetic information branching from\na single ancestor, such as fungi and plants. Previously, species of fungi and angiosperms (flowering\nplants) were known to extend over a hundred metres and reach ages in the order of centuries. However, their actual ages can vary widely depending\non the size and number of samples taken as well\nas the location. The team also questioned why the\ndistribution of samples was so closely correlated\nto the maximum size of the colony.\nBy analysing the spatial cover of Posidonia oce-anica, a species of seagrass, Arnaud-Haond and\nher colleages attempted to estimate the potential\nage of the plant clone. Their findings showed that\nto reach a km-range spread via clonal growth only\nwould relate to a minimum age of about 12,500\nyears. When a similar method was used on two\npairs of meadows in the Mediterranean, located\n7 km apart between Formentera and Ibiza and\n15 km apart around a cape in Formentera, the\nminimum age was placed between 80,000 and\n200,000 years, meaning the meadows originated\nduring the late Pleistocene Epoch.\nHowever, the research team is uncertain; due\nto global rises in sea level during the last ice\nage (80,000 to 10,000 years ago), the meadows\nwould have been at least 100m above sea level\nand being a marine plant, the clone would not\nhave been able to survive. One possible solution\nis that the meadows were carried by glacial flows\nand split, being able to cover wider areas of land\nand affecting the validity of the method used to\ncalculate age.\nAnother factor the team noted was that the population is falling rapidly, possibly due to human\ninvolvement. Given that it may have taken the\nmeadow thousands of years to reach its current\nsize, it may be unable to cope with the pressure\nput on it by human population.\nDOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0030454\nPavitar Singh Devgon\nWorld\u2019s oldest living organism\nOrigin of life may be geothermal pool\nPosidonia oceanica\nWyss Institute, Harvard University\n\n"

    "content": "Data reliability and sensitivity\nMatt Allinson\nFeature Editor\nThis year, we got twice as many\nrespondents as last year. This was\nfantastic news; we were overjoyed\nto see that students were as\nexcited about this survey as we\nwere. Before we can start making\nconcrete conclusions about the\nsexual characteristics of Imperial\nstudents, we need to know for sure\nthat we have representative data of\nthe college.\nLast year, for example, we had\nno lesbian respondents. Before\nwe ran the headline \u201cNo Lesbians\nat Imperial College,\u201d however, we\nfigured that the veracity of our data\nwas probably to blame. With the\nincreased number of respondents\nwe are hoping for a broader spectrum\nof Imperial students.\nThis year, there was a fresher\nbias in the data, with 32% of our\nrespondents being freshers, while\nonly 28% of the whole college\npopulation are. The 4th years were\nunder-represented in the overall\nsurvey this year, making up 16%\nof the college total but only 13%\nof our respondents. 2nd and 3rd\nyears were also marginally under-represented.\nMore noticeable in the data\nspread is the over- and under-representation of departments.\nPrimarily, the over-representation of\nPhysics students (6.9% more of our\nrespondents were physicists than\nare members of college) and the\nunder representation of medics. (The\npercentage of respondents from the\nMedical School was 7% less than\nthe amount of medics that make up\nthe undergraduate body of Imperial.)\nThe computing department were\nalso slightly over-represented while\nChem Eng, Mech Eng and EEE were\nslightly under-represented.\nMore importantly, one must\nconsider the bias in the nature of\nthe questionnaire that can\u2019t be\nmeasured statistically. For example,\nthe majority of our respondents\nare happy with their sex lives, and\nare actually in a relationship. Is\nthis representative of the average\nImperial student? It\u2019s hard to say.\nIt\u2019s feasible to imagine that a sex\nsurvey is most likely to be filled\nout by someone with an interesting\nsex life than someone with nothing\nto report. So it\u2019s believable, for\nexample, that we don\u2019t have a true\nrepresentation of the number of\nvirgins at Imperial.\nUltimately, though, the main\ngoals of the sex survey were to be\nlight hearted and interesting. As\nscientists it\u2019s in our nature to try and\ngenerate the best data we possibly\ncan, however the very relaxed nature\nof the survey means we have to\ncompromise at times.\nThe sex survey has, noted failing\naside, allowed us to paint a broad\nand amusing snapshot of Imperial\u2019s\nsex life.\nThe lowdown on virginity at Imperial\nC\noming to a total of 17.8%\nof respondents, the data\nset of people who have\nyet to lose their virginity is significant enough\nto deserve a page of its own. The\ndiscussion below is based on data\ngathered from 49 female and 136\nmale respondents.\nPopulation\nSpread\nPerhaps unsurprisingly,\nthis section had more\nmale respondents than\nfemale. The imbalance\nwas slightly more\npronounced than the\nrest of the survey or\nthe population of\nImperial, with a ratio\nof almost 3:1.\nIt also does not\ncome as a surprise\nthat those who are\ntypically the youngest\nstudents are most likely\nto be virgins; this applies\nto almost a quarter of first-year students.\nAcross all age groups, a\nhigher portion of polled\nmales were virgins\nthan females, with the\ndifference becoming more\npronounced for those\nstudents who have spent\nmore time at Imperial.\nNotable is a more than 40%\ndecrease in the fraction of\nfemale students that are\nvirgins between their first\nand second year.\nMasturbation\nContrary to what you may\nexpect, virgins are no\nmore likely to masturbate\nbe truly significant considering the\nsize of the data sample available.\nConclusion\nIt may come as a shock, but there\nis a distinct statistical possibility\nthat Imperial students are, in fact,\nhuman beings. Virgins\u2019 decisions\nto indulge in onanism and erotica\ncome down to individual decisions\nrather than consequences of their\nlack of experience with sexual inter-course. We hate to disappoint.\nUnfortunately, your correspondent\nwas unable to find comparable data\nfrom other universities. Perhaps one\npeculiarity of our cherished College\nis that its students are more than\nhappy to discuss their sex life. That,\nor they just really like answering\nsurveys \u2013 we\u2019d have to poll them to\nfind out.\nthat of non-virgins. This data was\nonly slightly polarized by gender\nin the case of virgins, and strongly\nfor non-virgins (where more than\n40% of males said it did, whereas\nmore than two thirds of females\ndisagreed). This is, again, not too\nsurprising \u2013 those students who are\nsexually active are more likely to be\naffected by the gender ratio than\nthose who are not.\nPornography\nThere was almost no discernible\ndifference in virgins\u2019 porn habits;\nthey seem neither more nor less\ninclined to indulge in pornography.\nThose who stated that cultural or\nreligious reasons do not affect their\nsex lives tended to do so slightly\nmore frequently, however, the\ndifferences are not large enough to\nfrequently than their non-virgin\ncounterparts; the difference in the\nfraction of students who masturbate\ndaily to weekly is minimal. The\nspread in the virgins\u2019 data leaned a\nlot more significantly towards either\nextreme, with the vast majority of\nvirgins (almost 80%) masturbating\neither daily to a few times a week or\nless than a year to never, while the\nnon-virgins\u2019 frequencies were\nspread more evenly.\nThe gender split is\nnot surprising.

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX\n4\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNews Editors: Sophia David\nAlex Nowbar\nNew student mayoral manifesto\nFriday 02 MARCH 2012\nA student manifesto has been released in light\nof the London mayoral and assembly elections\nin May. The document, produced by Student\nVision for London in collaboration with many\nLondon universities\u2019 student unions, outlines\nnine key issues for students with demands for\nthe mayoral candidates to solve them.\nLondon\u2019s student population stands at\n433,000 - roughly one tenth of the city\u2019s voting population. Vision for London believe that\nstudents are currently under-represented by the\nGreater London Authority and their issues are\npoorly accounted for.\nWorking with Imperial College Union, as\nwell as student unions from the University of\nthe Arts, London School of Economics, King\u2019s\nCollege and Queen Mary, Vision for London\nhave identified nine problems, and solutions\nfor them, which affect a majority of students.\nThe issues fall into the categories of crime,\ntransport, housing and employment, and include demands for a 30% discount on pay-as-you-go travel, a higher maintenance allowance\nto reflect the greater cost of living in London,\nand an investigation into the poor state of student housing, with a view to creating a student\ncharter for landlords.\nThe needs of international students are also\nconsidered, with calls against discrimination\nand restrictions on who can be a guarantor for\ninternational students\u2019 accommodation. One\nissue raised by the Imperial College Union was\nto oppose the strict and often confusing regulations on student visas, claiming that they are\ndetrimental to London\u2019s economy and competitiveness as an academic centre. They also\nwere keen to promote problems which do not\njust affect Imperial students.\nA potential mayoral candidate debate happening at Imperial College is being planned,\nwith union president Scott Heath believing we\nare best-positioned to attract Boris Johnson to\nspeak; however, so far there are no confirmed\ndetails on this.\nThe Student Vision for London organisation urge all students to register to vote at their\nterm-time address. Their manifesto, and more\ninformation, can be found at http://visionfor-london.org.uk/.\nICU RAG was proud to offer students the opportunity to do a Jailbreak this year. Jailbreak has quite\na simple objective: get as far away from campus\nas possible in 18 hours and then get yourselves\nback whilst raising money for charity. And get a\nphoto of yourself holding a copy of felix to prove it.\nThis year it started on 18 February at 9am in\nBeit Quad, with groups dressed as students-cum-hobos to tigers to pirates embarking on a weekend of travel.\nFor most of the groups the first stop was Dover,\nwith Heathrow and London City airports unfortunately being rather dickish towards the students.\nWith the obvious exception of one group who went\npossibly to the pub and then White City, Edgware\nRoad and Brent Cross in an attempt to basically\ngo up North for a Night Out. When that failed, they\nwent down to Victoria Coach Station and were originally going to Penzance, but took the decision to\ninstead go to Manchester (which is geographically\ncloser to London) and then proceed to lash on.\nAnother group made their way to Cardiff by day\u2019s\nend, assuming that thanks to the signs being completely un-understandable that they were on the\nfar side of the globe, despite forgetting that they\nhadn\u2019t used their passports.\nHowever, some groups were considerably luckier\nin their ventures. Four groups made it onto the\nContinent. One for a fleeting moment in Dieppe,\nbefore following a stoned \u2018professional hitchhiker\u2019\nback to the UK. One had a grand tour of BelgiumAntwerp, Brussels and Bruges before going to Amsterdam, spending their euros on (in an entirely\nunderstandable way) chips and beer and waffles\nbefore concluding their grand tour possibly in an\nall-night caf\u00e9.\nHowever, one group conclusively proved to those\nwho chickened out at dover that persistence does\npay off. After 10 hours of sitting around waiting,\nthey got themselves to Magdeburg and Berlin,\nending under the Brandenburg gate on Sunday before flying/hitching their way back to London.\nOne group really did prove that all it takes is\na smile, thumbs up and some luck to get a free\nholiday. They hitched down across France (miss-ing Paris so no \u2018Eiffel Tower and Felix photo\u2019 from\nthem, unfortunately) to the South Coast and then\nsomehow got to Barcelona. Once there they decided to spend two nights in Barcelona \u2013 saw the\nsights, absorbed the culture, that sort of thing \u2013\nbefore flying back on Tuesday morning. And they\ndidn\u2019t spend a penny getting there.\nJack Hewitt \u2013 RAG Chair\nIn brief\nRAG Jailbreak\nNot that kind of jailbreak\nKeir Little\nUnion no longer cash-trated\nAs many happy sober (or otherwise) students\nmay have noticed, there is now a cash machine\nin the Union.\nIt has been placed in the alcove where the\nousted cash machine used to be. The official Felix position is that the new cash machine \u201clooks\nwell like one of those ones in Fabric or McDonalds that charges you\u201d. However, contrary to\nthat, the machine is actually free of charge. In\nother words, it doesn\u2019t cost you anything to take\nyour money out.\nScott Heath, Union President, said on his online Sabbatical blog about the news that it was\n\u201cremarkably easy to find people who wished to\ninstall a machine that cost \u00a31.50 or \u00a33.00 per\ntransaction\u201d before going on to point out that\nNew cash machine installed in Union building\nTim Arbabzadah finding a free-to-use one seemed \u201cillusive\u201d.\nWhen the Union finally did manage to find a\nwilling installer, BT said that the Union wasn\u2019t\nin possession of a phone line that was suitably\naccessible. In addition, BT said that providing\nthe correct line would cost \u00a330,000. Luckily, for\nthe Union, an alternative of using 3G was found.\nHeath\u2019s blog post concluded bywishing prospective users \u201chappy withdrawals\u201d.\nDare you go for the fifty pound note?\n\n"

    "content": "The disturbed mind of Yayoi Kusama is a fascinating place. An artist with links to Georgia\nO\u2019Keefe, Andy Warhol and Joseph Cornell, her\nart is inspired by her own hallucinations and\nher outlook on the world. Even before arriving\nat the exhibition entrance, you have already\nbeen greeted by huge red blow-up balls with\nwhite polka dots, hanging from the ceiling \u2013 a\nsmall taste of things to come.\nThis retrospective chronologically follows\nYayoi Kusama\u2019s journey to becoming Japan\u2019s\nbest-known modern artist, the events in her life\ndirectly corresponding to the development of\nher art. The collection begins with her early\ndays when, living in 1950\u2019s Japan, women\nwere not meant to paint. The first two rooms\nlure you gently into Kusama\u2019s world, but while\nthe paintings are relatively \u2018normal\u2019, they still\nfeel unnerving and there is already a presence\nof her signature polka dots, abstractly layered\nover the top of nature inspired pieces.\nThe move to New York prompted a freer\nstyle of art. When entering the third room \u2013 a\nlarge white room in which hang seven white\ncanvases, each one with slightly varying textures and densities of a repetitive pattern \u2013 a\nfeeling of calmness overcomes you. That is,\nuntil one closely inspects the \u2018Infinity Net\u2019\npaintings and realises that each dot has painstakingly been done by hand; with the tens of\nthousands of small dots on each canvas one\nenvisages Kusama, sat in a studio for hours at\na time, in a trance-like state, painting in this obsessive and compulsive way. There are small\nareas of a concentrated texture and then large\ninterrupting scrapes \u2013 parts where she\u2019s become frustrated with the monotonous process.\nStepping into room four entails leaving the\nreal world behind you and fully submerging\nyourself in Yayoi Kusama\u2019s alternative AvantGarde vision. You are confronted with some of\nher famous sculptures: everyday objects such\nas a couch, bookshelves and clothing covered\nin thousands of fabric penises.\nAs a forerunner to the development of pop\nart, Kusama thrived in swinging 1960\u2019s New\nYork, where she moved to performance art, using experimental Flower Children \u2013 the hippies\nof the 60\u2019s \u2013 in her work. One advert for volunteers states \u201cHappy people needed for Kusama\u2019s happening\u201d. The participants would get\nnaked in some of New York\u2019s public spaces,\nincluding Central Park and Brooklyn Bridge.\nThen, they would paint each other entirely in\npolka dots and dance, Kusama herself joining\nin.\nEasily the most disturbing and impacting part\nof the exhibition is Kusama\u2019s 1967 experimen-FELIX\nFriday 02 March 2012\n26\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts Editors: Will Prince\nEva Rosenthal\nARTS\nThe Poet\u2019s Column\nLost and alone with nowhere to turn,\nFor I\u2019m now without guidance, but still do I yearn\nTo belong and be and feel her kiss\nWhen life was good and careless bliss\nOnce, time ago, could I laugh,\nI used to smile and join in farce.\nI used to dance and sway her hips,\nI had my friends, I was transfixed\nI didn\u2019t waste time when each second was pre-cious,\nI didn\u2019t forget to give and share\nI always remembered everyone around me\nI\u2019ll always remember that they did care\nThere was a time, many moons before me\nWhen thoughtlessly I divided time,\nIt worked in instants when I was busy\nBy when alone, I fell out of rhyme\nAnd now that I can finally think\nPlan ahead and quaff this drink\nAll I seem to do is long\nTo be young again and change this song\nI don\u2019t want to think or plan ahead\nI want it done and follow the dead\nEndlessly plodding on the track of life\nTil comes the end, til falls the knife\nOlgen\u2019s key is now at hand\nAnd with it do I have a plan\nI can use it to make it mine\nAnd live in life, ah, so sublime\nGoodbye to those who knew me well,\nFor a fresh bold shore do I set sail\nWith a dampened map and a rusty knife\nA hidden key and forty tales.\nTake this, ye, last momentum from me,\nLive life fun while time with thee be.\nNe\u2019er look back and wish undone,\nLook to the fore and plan some fun!\ncolours in different patterns is worth the entrance fee alone. Because of the darkness in\nthe room you can\u2019t see your own reflection so\nit gives the impression of never-ending space\nwith millions and millions of little multico-loured lights. It\u2019s breathtaking and you could\nliterally waste hours away in here with the outside world a mere distant memory. This is how\nYayoi Kusama sees the world and you come\nout feeling very privileged to have experienced\nit.\nAs the revision and exam period quickly approaches we all need a bit of escapism. When\nthe pressure mounts I urge you to take a couple\nof hours out of your day to visit Kusama\u2019s\nworld. I promise the stresses of Imperial life\nwill be forgotten instantly. There\u2019s something\nincredible about her work; art critic Sir Herbert Read described her pieces as \u201cimages of\nstrange beauty that press on our organs of perception with terrifying persistence\u201d.\nAs with all Tate events, the exhibition is perfectly set out as a journey and you come out\nwith a deep understanding of Kusama and her\nwork. However, it is no coincidence that upon\nleaving the exhibition space you are greeted by\nthe staircase leading straight up to the 7th floor\nbar \u2013 a large glass of wine is needed for recali-brationw into the real world.\nYayoi Kusama at Tate Modern until\n5 June. Tickets from \u00a310\nLaura Johnston\ntal film \u2018Kusama\u2019s Self-Obliteration\u2019 which is\nshown on a large screen in a dark room. The\nbulk of the film follows Kusama \u2013 herself covered in polka dots \u2013 through a forest whilst she\nblankets everything in sight in polka dots, ob-sessively, like the main character of a horror\nmovie would; a horse, trees, a lily pad in the\nmiddle of a lake and even a very unhappy cat\nall suffer the same fate. The film then moves to\na dark room in which a group of hippies participates in a drug-fuelled, polka-dot body-paint-covered orgy. At one point the camera zooms\ninto a man\u2019s penis as Kusama paints little blue\npolka dots all over it. It\u2019s shocking yet you sit\nthere paralysed, mouth gaping, unable to keep\nyour eyes off it. By the end, you\u2019re absolutely\nsympathetic with Kusama\u2019s state of mind to the\npoint where you start feeling like you\u2019re almost\ngoing crazy yourself \u2013 covering a forest in polka dots? What a bloody good idea!\nAfter moving back to Japan in the early 70s\nand voluntarily admitting herself into a psychiatric hospital some years later (where she has\nlived ever since) Kusama returned to sculpture\nand installations and, to a lesser extent, paint-ing. One of her most famous installations, \u2018I\u2019m\nhere, but Nothing\u2019 (2000-2012), was particularly eerie: it consists of a normal front room lit\nonly by UV lights, where everything \u2013 couches,\nlamps, a TV, even the flowers on the dining table \u2013 are covered in fluorescent polka dots that\nlook almost like light beams that should disappear as you walk past the source. Playing on the\nTV, and unsettling the atmosphere, is a video of\nKusama singing a creepy Japanese song.\nThe showstopper of the whole exhibition is\nthe final installation \u2018Infinity Mirrored RoomFilled with the Brilliance of Light\u2019, which\nKusama has created especially for the Tate\nModern. The small dark room with mirror-covered walls and hanging lights that change\n\u201cIt\u2019s shocking yet you sit\nthere paralysed...unable\nto keep your eyes off it\u201d\nGoing dotty for Kusama\nTate Modern has us turning Japanese and just a little mad\n\u201cShe blankets everything\nin sight in polka dots...a\nhorse, trees, a lily-pad...\u201d\nJust Have Some Fun\nby Pavitar Devgon\nFelix Arts is\nconstantly\nlooking for new\npoets.

Prices of \u00a350 for booking\nweekend use were introduced without a\nconsultation period, focus group or notification to the clubs.\nPrior to the merger of several medical schools to form the Imperial College\nSchool of Medicine, the hut was donated\nto St Mary\u2019s Hospital Medical School\nwith the intent to encourage students to\ntake part in outdoor activities without incurring further costs.Yet, students believe\ncharging goes against the original aims of\nthe donation.\nBaffled students in various outdoor\nclubs took to Facebook with an online\npage and petition in protest. In the peti-tion, which gained 206 signatures at the\ntime of writing, students posted comments such as: \u201cthis goes totally against\nthe spirit of the charitable donation of the\nhut\u201d, \u201ccharging\u2026 is simply unacceptable,\nparticularly without consultation\u201d, and\n\u201cas a club we simply wouldn\u2019t have been\nable to take so many people into the outdoors so frequently without it, and we really appreciated this charitable donation\u201d.\nRecreational clubs which were affected\ninclude the Fellwanderers, Mountaineering, Canoeing and various other outdoor\nsocieties, who collectively believed that\n\u201ccharging for use\u2026 goes against the\noriginal intentions of the donation and\nis the first step in commercialising this\ncharitable gift\u201d.

First thing\nto note is that 96 is divisible\nby three, so it is possible\nthey were all Imperial threesomes,\nalthough we cannot confirm or deny\nthis fact. We didn\u2019t ask about any\nlarger groups of people, although\nthe comments box at the end could\nhave been used to tell us (or brag\nabout) your experiences.\nSexuality and gender\nOut of those who said they had\nhad a threesome, 54 were hetero-sexual, 19 were homosexual, and\n23 were bisexual. This information\ncan be seen in the pie chart below.\nUnfortunately, we didn\u2019t get to find\nout what combination of gender\nthe threesomes were. However, we\ncan tell you that. of the people that\nclaimed to have been in a three-some, 61 were male and 32\nwere female.\nAsking for\nthreesomes\nIn terms of asking for\nthreesomes: well, let\u2019s\njust say, not everyone\ngot their wish. 136 people admitted to asking for\na threesome. That leaves 40\npeople hastily trying to pretend that they were only jok-ing. Of the 136, 103 were\nmale and 32 were female.\nThis can be seen in the in-fographic on the right. The\nkeen mathematicians amongst\nyou will be able to spot that\nthose numbers don\u2019t add up.\nThat\u2019s because of the\n\u201cdon\u2019t wish to say\u201d option\nthat was available in all\nthe questions. However,\nthe statistics do clearly\nshow that men were\nmore willing to ask for\na threesome, or, at very\nleast, more willing to admit to Felix that they asked\nfor a threesome.\nBeen asked\nWhen it comes to being\nasked, it seemed a lot of\npeople have. In fact, way more have\nbeen asked than have asked. 256\nwere found to have been asked\nfor a threesome. Again, looking at\nthe number that actually followed\nthrough, it seems there were a\nlot of awkward silences.\nThe split this time was\nmuch more even. In\nfact, more men were\nasked than women.\n131 men, compared to\n121 women, said that\nthey\u2019d been asked,\nwith the remaining\n4 not wishing to disclose their gender.\nBreakdown by\nsubject\nThe subject chart\nspeaks for itself really.\nThis is starting to feel\nlike the oddest lab report\nin history. If I turn this\ninto my supervisor, would\nthis count as progress for\nscience? Yeah, fine, I\u2019ll do\nthat. It turns out Physics\nis the most prone to three-somes, or lying. 14 people\nsaid that they had participated in a threesome. Life\nScience and Chemistry are\njoint second.

I think the\nsex survey is excellent, because it\nbrings a topic that is often taboo\nand kept quiet in the Anglo Saxon\nworld to very bright daylight, and I\nthink that\u2019s a wonderful thing. For\nexample, the fact that some people\nhave over 30 sex toys is okay, and\nit\u2019s also good for people to know\nthat it\u2019s okay. For people who are\nreticent about getting their very\nfirst sex toy are encouraged and\nnormalised and made to know that\nit\u2019s not that weird.\nPeople\u2019s attitudes towards sex\ncan have a massive impact on\ntheir lives. Some use sex to boost\ntheir self esteems, which can be\ndangerous, whilst others can try to\nuse it to hold on to their partners,\nwhich obviously leads to a separate\nset of complications. Sex should\nnever be used as a tool, though\nunfortunately it often is. A healthy\nattitude to sex is important, and\nan understanding of your rights,\nthat it\u2019s always OK to say no, for\nwhatever reason, is critical.

    "content": "Tips & Hacks\nCheaper mobile roaming charges\nIn an attempt to avoid shock bills for customers,\nthis week MEPs have voted to introduce a cap on\nwhat companies can charge per megabyte of data\nwhile roaming. Additionally they have voted to cut\nprices for texts and calls, but this is the first time\nany limitation has ever been made on data. In the\nage of the \u2018always-on\u2019 smartphone, turning your\nphone on for even a few minutes while abroad\ncan result in a massive \u2013 and often unexpected\n\u2013 bill. While each tweet, email and status update\nmay only be a few kilobytes, it all adds up. This\nis a very positive step then for anyone who travels abroad and wants to keep in touch with his/\nher digital world. While this legislation is not final,\nall further approval is expected to be \u201ca rubber-stamping exercise\u201d. So, by mid-2014, we should\nbe seeing maximum charges of 12p per minute,\n4p per text and 16p per megabyte.\nI\n\u2019m quite ambivalent when it comes to\nthe relative merits of operating systems\nand the devices they run on. The Mac vs.\nPC debate has been stumbling along for\nalmost as long as I can remember, and\nmuch of what can be said has been said, many\ntimes over. Suffering the minor misfortune of\nhaving to use Windows, OS X and Linux on a\nregular basis, it\u2019s hard to have strong opinions\nwhen at the end of the day a computer is really just a lump of metal and plastic, and not a\nphilosophical statement, despite what Stephen\nFry would have you believe.\nIn choosing a modern laptop/operating sys-tem, what you are really debating is largely personal preference: aside from gamers who have\nmore options on Windows, buying a laptop\nusually boils the decision making process down\nto a question of money and aesthetic ideals. So\nwhat does a Macbook Air do to define itself as\nunique? Quite a lot, as we shall soon see. In\nthis review, I have forgone the usual listing of\nspecifications and benchmarking tests: the laptop has been out for 6 months now and there\u2019s\nenough of that available online if you need it.\nWhat I have tried to focus on is the experience\nof using a Mac as a student. If you have been\nsitting on the fence about buying a Macbook\nfor a while, my goal is to push you off it in either direction.\nRemarkably thin and elegant, the Air is one\nof the most striking laptops I have ever used.\nThe hardware has clearly been designed to benefit the user experience: one pleasing difference\nfrom the average laptop is its roomy touchpad.\nFor such a thin piece of kit, it also sits well\nin the hand \u2013 I often found myself carrying it\naround with one hand as easily as I would a\nsheaf of papers. The only real problem I had\nwith it from a design perspective is how easily I misplaced it on my desk, which is more a\ntestament to its diminutive size rather than any\nmisstep on Apple\u2019s part.\nIn terms of performance, I was quite happy\nwith the system as it was \u2013 when it came to\nbrowsing, doing some writing and watching\nflash videos (what I mostly use my computer\nfor, aside from programming), the Air performed solidly. If you require Matlab or other\nmajor programming IDEs such as Eclipse, the\nhigher-end Air coming in with 4GB of memory\nand an i7 processor would be a better bet, but\nkeep in mind the limited space (256GB being\nthe upper storage limit on the device) would\nprobably require investment in an external hard\ndrive.\nConsidering the solid state drive and the i5/\ni7 processors inside these machines, the smooth\nperformance isn\u2019t much of a surprise. In terms\nof Flash in particular, I was impressed by how\neasily the device handled the plugin, something\nthat I have had troubles with on Linux for a\nwhile now. Battery life was comparable to my\nnot-so-ultra ultrabook, which is impressive,\nand probably enough to get you through a normal day at uni without having to rely on finding a power socket. I was very impressed by\nthe speaker quality, which was loud and clear\n\u2013 something I was not expecting considering I\nstill don\u2019t know exactly where the sound was\ncoming from.\nElegant and a good performer; so where are\nthe Air\u2019s flaws? I have to admit I was not too\nenamoured of OS X. Where I look at plans for\nWindows 8 and see changes that Microsoft\nhas planned, OS X seems very much transi-tional. The changes to the UI are there (fingers\nflick up to scroll up, other gestures to do other\nfancy things), but it\u2019s not the same big break\nthat Microsoft and some other Linux operating\nsystems are experimenting with. Whether this\nPerfection, at a premium\nFELIX\nFriday 02 march 2012\n16\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTechnology Editors: Chris Bowers\nFeroz Salam\nTECHNOLOGY\nis necessarily a bad thing, I don\u2019t know. OS X\nwas for a very long time a leader in terms of\nUI functionality, and it is still very much on\npar with the other major operating systems. If\nyou\u2019re looking for the \u2018next big thing\u2019however,\nthis isn\u2019t it.\nAnother issue that is not so much a criticism but a statement of fact revolves around\nthe price. This is not so much an argument\nabout Apple\u2019s Air as much as a point about\n\u2018ultrabooks\u2019 in general. The Air and ASUS\u2019s\nZenbook both retail at roughly the same price\n(after Apple\u2019s student discount is taken into ac-count). For shaving off a kilo or two in weight\n(and taking a slight performance hit), you are\npaying a premium of roughly 200 pounds (HP\u2019s\nPavilion series offer the same processor and a\nbetter spec for the extra weight). Whether or not\nthis is worth it is only a call you can make. If\nyour budget for a computer hovers around 1000\npounds and you aren\u2019t a power user (the Air, re-member, doesn\u2019t offer a CD drive, only has two\nUSB ports and comes with basic Intel integrated graphics), this might be the laptop for you.\nI liked the Macbook Air, a lot. I don\u2019t usually care about the computer beneath my fingers as long as it works, but it\u2019s very obvious\nthat a lot of effort has gone into making the\nAir something special. It\u2019s different, and not\nin a bad way. It can also handle your everyday\ncomputing tasks for a whole day, something\nthat can\u2019t be said about some other ultrabooks\nreleased over the last few years. OS X may not\nbe a revolutionary computing experience, but\nit\u2019s a solid system that compares favourably in\nmany aspects to Windows. The real question, as\nalways withApple products, is whether you can\njustify the price: if you\u2019re someone who wants\na feature for every penny, this may not be the\ndevice you\u2019re looking for. If you\u2019re willing to\naccept the price premium for a laptop so thin\nthat it could also be used as a cheese slicer, I say\ngo for it: you\u2019re not going to find much better\nout there.\nTweet archives open for business\nTwitter has this week \u201cunlocked\u201d its tweet archives for market research purposes, allowing\nbusinesses access to tweets dating back to the\nbeginning of 2010. Specifically, it has partnered\nwith the UK-based data mining company Datasift,\nwho \u2013 while analysing approximately 250 million\ntweets each day, will provide the data to others for\na fee. For comparison, companies used to be able\nto search only thirty days\u2019 worth of tweets, and\nregular users are still limited to seven days. This\nhas, of course, sparked privacy concerns, but Twitter has quickly come forward to shoot them down.\nThe executive director of Privacy International, Gus\nHosein, claims people have always been happy\nto use Twitter in the knowledge that their tweets\nwould disappear fairly rapidly. Twitter\u2019s counterar-gument, however, is that people use the service\nknowing that what they tweet is visible to anyone\nat that given moment. Of course, private and deleted tweets will not be made available to anyone,\nwhich one would expect. Even so, it will be interesting to see if this affects Twitter\u2019s popularity.\nFeroz Salam finally gets his hands on a Macbook Air\n\u201c[the Air] is elegant and\na good performer\u201d\n\n"

It was only after spending a few\ndays working on David Freud\u2019s (now\nLord Freud, and indeed grandson of Sigmund Freud) team that Katz first started\nhis rapid progression up the banking\nhierarchy. Having requested to stay\non Freud\u2019s team, he was now part of a\nsmaller team and was allowed to make\nmuch bigger contributions and meet clients regularly. This idea of initiative and\nboldness was one that Katz continued to\nemphasise throughout the talk and it became clear it was an ethos he has lived\nby since. Only a few years after joining\nthe firm, Katz suggested the creation of\na hotel and leisure division, an area that\naccounted for 10% of GDP but did not\nits own specialist division yet, much to\neveryone\u2019s disbelief. Despite now leading his own desk, his superiors refused\nto make him a MD straight off the bat as\nhe and his team were essentially thought\nof as \u201ca bunch of kids taking charge of\na new division\u201d. His only way of impressing on to them that he deserved the\ntitle was to secure clients and complete\ndeal after deal, which is precisely what\nhe did. The main thing budding investment bankers must always bear in mind\nis that \u201cyou\u2019re being paid for you commercial judgement and will be judged\nsolely on performance\u201d.\nIn the following years, Katz successfully led the division from strength to\nKatz then continues to explain how he\nfound himself somewhat bored of the\ndaily office grind and decided in 2007,\nwhen the economic landscape was still\nflourishing, to start up a private equity\nfirm and continue to use his experience\nof the leisure and travel industry.\nHaving left the bank and founded\n\u2018Kings Park Capital\u2019, Katz readily admitted that he and his team no longer\nenjoyed quite as lavish a lifestyle as his\nformer IB colleagues. Not to say that he\nis doing particularly badly, having flown\nin to London from Cape Town that day\nand heading to New York City the morning after the event.\nThe differences between working as\na dealmaker in an Investment Bank and\nin a private equity firm were frequently\nhighlighted. With only 7 people working in the office and his own money at\nstake Katz remarked on how much more\npersonal his everyday business became,\nand the increasing selectiveness that\nhe and his partner have had to exercise\nwhen choosing a company to invest into.\nIn fact, KPC sees approximately 200 investment opportunities per year but on\naverage only invests in 2 to 3 of those.\nHowever raising the money to invest\ninto these couple of opportunities has\nnot been an entirely smooth road. Of\nthe total 400 entities approached, only\n50 agreed to put money behind the new\ncompany, raising a total of \u00a360 million,\na long shot from the \u00a3200 million that\nwas the original aim. Despite this Katz\nseemed optimistic for the next fundraise,\nemphasizing how important the fact was\nthat KPC was now no longer a new company with no clients, increasing the likelihood that institutional investors would\nconsider them this time round.\nAs the evening drew to a close with a\nQ&A session, Katz responded to a suggestion that there was nothing left to explore in private equity by joking that the\nexact same would have been said after\nthe invention of the wheel and electric-ity, highlighting that there were always\ngoing to be new opportunities in the\nmarket, some simply requiring more resourcefulness and patience than others,\nleaving the audience with the distinct\nimpression that this was a man who still\nhad many a goal to accomplish, despite\nalready achieving so much in a very\nshort amount of time.\nCraig Glastonbury\nStay ahead of the game with Traderversity\nFor further details, email craig.\nglastonbury09@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "This week, Felix releases the full results\nof the much-anticipated sex survey. This\ntypically makes for depressing reading in a\nuniversity concerned with its high levels of\n\u201cgeekiness\u201d and obsessed with a less than\nideal gender ratio. Beyond the statistics and\nthe innuendo, there is, however, a hidden and,\nI believe, largely positive message of how far\nBritish society has come, holding such a survey would have been unthinkable when Felix\nwas founded. While the survey has only been\nrun for two years, is still highly anonymous,\nfilled with \u201cI\u2019d prefer not to say\u201d and is taboo discussion outside the student world, it\nreflects a freedom that still does not exist in\nmany countries. This week, we look at the\nsexual rights that we take for granted but continue to be restricted around the world.\n80% of Imperial students are not virgins, yet\nvery few students are married. Other than\nduring a brief Puritan period (1650-1660),\nthis has largely been legal (though often scandalous or taboo) in England. However, the act\nis forbidden under Islamic law (Zina) and is\nillegal in at least twelve Muslim countries.\nIt has been 45 years since homosexuality\nwas decriminalised, and only 8 years since\ncivil partnerships were introduced, but 14%\nof students described themselves as either\nbisexual or homosexual. Homosexuality is\nlegal in much of the world, and marriage legislation has been passed in much of Europe\nand the mainland of the Americas. In 2009,\nthe Indian Supreme Court finally deemed old\nanti-homosexual colonial legislation as un-constitutional, freeing a further one-fifth of\nthe world\u2019s homosexual population. It may\nseem progress is being made, but the reality\nis homosexual acts remain illegal in much of\nthe Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean. In\nmany (largely Muslim) countries, homosexuals are executed. In much of Africa, things\nare moving backwards. In Uganda, an anti-homosexual bill has re-emerged, though with\nthe odious death penalty for repeat \u201coffenders\u201d removed after international pressure, as\nMPs continued to describe homosexuality as\n\u201cun-African\u201d and \u201cun-Christian\u201d.\n55% of students admitted to having sex\nwithout any method of contraception. While\nmost will be able to look back at this as a\nstupid mistake with no real consequences,\nin much of the world it could change your\nlife completely. While abortions can legally\ntake place in almost every country on Earth,\nin most of Africa, South America, the Middle\nEast and the Far East, making a stupid drunken mistake is not a valid excuse. In fact, rape\nis often not considered a valid reason \u2013 abortions are typically only legal if the mother\u2019s\nhealth is at risk.\nOkay, I can\u2019t give any Imperial statistic for\nthis one \u2013 I would hope the college degree\nhas a good enough reputation that no student\nFreedom to Fornicate\nImperial doesn\u2019t seem so bad now, does it?\nwould ever have to turn to selling their body.\nHowever, the law is nevertheless important.\nThe \u201coldest profession in the world\u201d is illegal\nin much of Africa, Asia (notable examples include India and Kazakhstan) and the United\nStates (though not Nevada). In a small number of countries (see above) it is regulated\nand legal, but in most countries (including the\nUnited Kingdom) laws exist against brothels\nand pimping. The exchange of sex for money\nis not, however, a criminal offence.\nIt should be noted that these laws often fail\nto reflect the reality on the ground. Homosexuals are often attacked and even killed\nwithout any concern from authorities in\ncountries where it has been decriminalised.\nAbortions and prostitution are widespread in\nall countries. The difference is that in areas\nwhere they are illegal, abortions are often\nvery dangerous and prostitutes may be attacked without protection from the authorities \u2013 a particular problem in Pakistan where\nfornication, homosexuality and prostitution\nare illegal yet eunuch brothels are common-place.\nHowever, while the United Kingdom may\nhave made progress in these areas, this does\nnot make us \u201cfree\u201d. Islamic countries, for\ninstance, often allow polygamy (though, im-portantly, only with one man), while British\nlaw still only gives advantages (in the form\nof tax breaks) to pairs of people who make a\nlong term commitment in the form of marriage or civil partnership. Further, \u201cpimps\u201d\nas legal employers would have the duty to\nprotect prostitutes \u2013 a single woman working\nalone is at far greater risk of being harmed.\nFELIX\nFriday 02 MARCH 2012\n18\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPolitics Editors: Rajat Jain\nJoseph Letts\nPOLITICS\nImperial is an orgy by international standards\nFebruary in Quotations\npolitics.felix@ic.ac.uk\nGot something to say?

    "content": "T\nhe Dickens exhibition at the Museum of London contrives a fair\nrepresentation of the city in the\n19th century, allowing us to walk\nthe very streets that Dickens himself traversed, and through which he invented\na score of enduring characters that relate to\nreaders even today. London of the mid-1800s\nis more than just the backdrop of Dickens\u2019 sto-ries. It is a central character itself in his works,\nrhythmically vacillating between protagonist\nand antagonist. As the exhibition guides us\nthrough the chronology of the author\u2019s work,\nwe cannot help but bear witness to the dramatic transformations of London life. From\nSketches by Boz to Our Mutual Friend, the city\nmatures just as much as its revered biographer.\nAmong the characters and alongside the plot-lines, we find ourselves in the midst of the Industrial Revolution.\nIn one particular exhibit, we are informed \u2013\nby virtue of some anonymous scholar \u2013 that\nDickens was optimistic about the type of society that industrialization could usher in. It\nis explained that he held great hope for the\npotential benefits that technological advancement offered society. This is in stark contrast\nto many other scholastic writings about Dickens\u2019 attitude towards industrialization. Many\nacademics cite Oliver Twist and Hard Times\n(among others) as unmistakable condemnations of the shifting society. But these \u2013 perhaps prematurely \u2013 fuse Dickens\u2019 views with\nthose who outright opposed industrialization\nand the hellfire and brimstone perceptions of\nthe type of world that innovations in productive capacity would bring. (Such apocalyptic\nattitudes are perhaps most vividly allegorized\nin J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s descriptions of Mordor).\nAlthough his work frequently spotlights the\ncruel indifference of modern life, we too are\nmade known of Dickens\u2019 resilient hope for\nthe future. He was even once referred to as a\n\u201cvulgar optimist.\u201d Despite this apparent con-tradiction, we can be certain of one thing: sordid or sublime, Dickens managed to illustrate\nhis surroundings with a unique vitality. The\nstale pubs, debauched gin houses and wretched\npawn shops were all painted with a peculiar\nstroke of charm that was at once full of squalor and liveliness \u2013 something which seems to\nhave been a prevailing characteristic of 19th\ncentury London.\nSo, how can his optimism be reconciled with\nthe apparent wrongs about which Dickens\nwrote? Consider Adam Smith in The Wealth\nof Nations:\n\u201cThe violence and injustice of the rulers of\nmankind is an ancient evil, for which, I am\nafraid, the nature of human affairs can scarce\nadmit of a remedy. But the mean rapacity, the\nmonopolizing spirit of merchants and manufacturers who neither are, nor ought to be, the\nrulers of mankind, though it, perhaps, cannot\nbe corrected, may very easily be prevented\nGreat Expectations?\nfrom disturbing the tranquility of anybody but\nthemselves.\u201d\nIt is perhaps wrong to say that Dickens outright opposed industrialization and the productive innovations it spawned. But his aversion\ntowards the \u201cmean rapacity\u201d and heartless\ngreed of the owners of production and their\ncruelty \u2013 especially towards children \u2013 is un-mistakable. Bleak House and capture especially well Dickens\u2019 reservations for many\nof the contemptible practices that prevailed\nduring industrial times. It may have been his\nintention to prevent the merchants and manufactures from \u201cdisturbing the tranquility of\nanybody but themselves,\u201d although to say that\nDickens opposed industrialization in itself may\nbe painting with too broad a brush. Conversely, to claim that Dickens was optimistic about\nmodernity, full stop, neglects a great many\nreservations I suspect he had about the changing times \u2013 amongst them the changing face\nof his beloved city. This was perhaps a more\ncertain and inevitable effect of industrialisa-tion. In fact, it is interesting to read Dickens\u2019\nthoughts on one innovation in particular \u2013 the\nrailroad. Dickens was said to have been at two\nminds about the railroad system. He submitted to their facilitation of modern obligations,\nbut he also feared that they would break apart\nneighbourhoods and families, attributes of the\ncommunal spirit about which he often wrote.\nHis reservations about the metamorphoses\nthat London was undergoing are apparent. On\none hand, there is the Dickens who was hopeful for the potential benefits of industrializa-tion. On the other hand, there is the Dickens\nwho saw its potential side effects: both the\nFELIX\nFriday 02 MARCH 2012\n28\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts Editors: Will Prince\nEva Rosenthal\nARTS\nThe Poet\u2019s Column\nThe Purist\nby Ogden Nash\nWhen people aren\u2019t asking question\nThey\u2019re making suggestions\nAnd when they\u2019re not doing one of those\nThey\u2019re either looking over your shoulder or stepping on your toes\nAnd then as if that weren\u2019t enough to annoy you\nThey employ you.\nAnybody at leisure\nIncurs everybody\u2019s displeasure.\nIt seems to be very irking\nTo people at work to see other people not working,\nSo they tell you that work is wonderful medicine,\nJust look at Firestone and Ford and Edison,\nAnd they lecture you till they\u2019re out of breath or\nsomething\nAnd then if you don\u2019t succumb they starve you to\ndeath or something.\nAll of which results in a nasty quirk:\nThat if you don\u2019t want to work you have to work\nto earn enough money so that you won\u2019t have to\nwork.\nOgden Nash (1902 - 1971) was an American poet.\nHe wrote mostly light verse and he only attended\nHarvard University for one year (dropped out \u2013 incase you\u2019re getting any ideas).\n\u201c...We bear witness to\nthe dramatic transformations of London life\u201d\nJoseph Kaupp on Dickens and his (perhaps misunder-stood) views on the Industrial Revolution\nI-Night\nInternational night, coined I-Night, has been ongoing for more than a decade.

Next was the men\u2019s\ncoxless four (bow: Rory Sullivan/Matt\nPointing/Ali Hudson/Ben Spencer\nJones) who took the bronze medal in a\ntime of 13:32.6. Unfortunately the guys\nwere unavailable for comment after the\nrace. The men\u2019s coxed four (cox: Jess\nJohnson/Hal Bradbury/Simon Steele/\nJames Hobhouse/Danny Bellion)\nsmashed down the power to take fourth\nplace, the same position their time of\n13:50.4 would have earned them in the\ncoxless event.\nFor the first time since 2009, ICBC\nhad a senior women\u2019s eight entered into\nBUCS. Although they had had only two\noutings and some side-switching was\nrequired, the girls (cox: Libby Richards/Klara Weaver/Louise Connell/\nLily Beadle/Hannah Patterson/Rosie\nDavies/Harriet Cross/Cat Buizza/Si\u00e2n\nMorgan) smashed it to take fourth place\nin a time of 14:41.8. In another break\nwith tradition, lightweight women\nwere racing and the quad (bow: Maddy\nWhybrow/Steph Lunt/Ana Yong/Alice\nPistolesi) consisted of three of Imperial\u2019s finest novices and one from last\nyear\u2019s intake. The tiny girls battled\nagainst the headwind and crossed the\nline to take 7th in the event in 17:37.3.\nTheir male counterparts continued\nto build on their practically unbeaten\nrecord in the men\u2019s lightweight cox-less four (bow: Paddy Hudson/Gareth\nBrown/Wilf Kimberley/Tim Richards)\nas they took the win in 13:20.6, 10s\nahead of their competition and 12s\nahead of IC\u2019s heavyweights.\nOn the way up to the start of division 2,\ndisaster struck the women\u2019s lightweight\ncoxless four (bow: Whybrow/Lunt/Pistolesi/Hannah Neenan) as the rudder\nstring broke, forcing the girls onto the\nbank and into cheerleading roles; welcome encouragement for those racing at\none of the toughest parts of the course.\nThis left only the women\u2019s coxed four\n(cox: Johnson/Patterson/Cross/Connell/\nWeaver) to represent the fairer half of\nICBC. Despite a fracas with Edinburgh\nUniversity, whose stroke girl decided\nthe slower crew had right of way, the\ngirls finished off the day in the smashing time of 15:08.0. They took the silver medal, just 2s behind winners and\n24s ahead of third place and would have\nwon the women\u2019s coxless four catego-ry; a promising start to 2012 for the female students.\nLeading the second division and\nwearing the coveted number 1 were\nthe men\u2019s championship eight (cox:\nL Richards/Spencer Jones/Sullivan/\nPointing/A Hudson/Bellion/Hobhouse/\nSteele/Bradbury). Starting the division\nmeant the eight enjoyed perfect water\nwith only the gusty headwind to contend with. Great crew spirit kept the\nrate up and the power going down all\nthe way along the course, with Spencer\nJones and Sullivan bashing out a strong\nrhythm. The guys completed the course\nin 12:08.6, an agonisingly close 0.4s\nbehind Durham, forcing them to settle\nfor the Bronze medal behind the two\nnorth-eastern universities, with Newcastle taking the win. The next closest\ncrew were more than 30s off the pace.\nThe lightweight men were back out\nin the same order (bow: P Hudson/\nBrown/Kimberley/T Richards) but with\ntwo blades each instead of one for the\nmen\u2019s lightweight quad. The glassy water experienced by the eight had turned\nto vicious waves by the time the quad\narrived. The skinny boys soldiered on,\nwearing their new tartan leggings and\ncamouflage lycra combination, and\nadded another gold to their ever expanding collection in 12:46.6.\nOnce back in London, some headed\nto Fiesta Havanas to dance away their\nlast remaining ounces of energy. Over\nthe weekend, 93 BUCS points were\nwon between the ten championship\nboats, giving a running total of 123 so\nfar this season.

The game started off slowly\nwith half of our team away with the\nfairies and severely hungover from\nthe previous weekend \u2013 we know, it\u2019s\nan issue.\nAfter a bit of scrappy hockey we\nsettled back into our classic form and\nKirstin slotted in a quick two goals to\ntake us ahead at half time. With a riveting half-time chat from our award\nwinning coach, we started strongly\ninto the second half. Gigi showed the\nother team what hockey skills were\nand defenders Celia, Aash and Maria\ncut shapes through their midfield like\nImperial boys in Metric on a Wednesday. With our legendary passing seriously confusing the other team (and\nwith a few protein shakes later) we\nwere many more goals up and showing the Brunel girls who really was\ntop of the league.\nThe defence held steady with the\naddition of Shanika taking it up the\nrear, an unusual position for her as\nshe is usually running riot with Scorcha up front. Harry, Ted, Nora and\nsupersub Hannah all trashed the goalkeeper and took us to a 6-1 lead (their\nonly goal coming from GK Percy\u2019s\ncharitable conscience).

Besides, it is a fact, especially for those studying economics, that a\ncountry so small as Greece and with such a\nsmall and limited economy, can easily drag\ndown healthy(?) economies such as America\u2019s, the UK\u2019s and Europe\u2019s.

As a starter we had the traditional\nTzatziki \u2013 Real Greek is the only restaurant\nin London that makes it with garlic instead\nof mint, as we were told by the waiter \u2013 and\nBabaganoush, a light and fragrant blend of\nsmoked aubergine, tahini and garlic, served\nwith the necessary Greek flatbread.\nAs soon as the king of all dishes, the Greek\nSouvlaki, arrived, we were super-excited. It\narrived accompanied with grilled Cypriot\nHalloumi cheese, pork sausage and delicious\nhandmade pastry parcels with creamy leek,\nspinach and feta filling, known as Tiropitakia. It\u2019s quite hard to explain with words,\nhow few dishes combined with familiar music melodies and Thames waters can instantly take you back home. OK, the truth is that\nwe simply can\u2019t be unbiased in this review.\nBut it\u2019s a fact that the restaurant was literally\npacked, by people from various nationalities,\nwho seemed to enjoy it as much as we did.\nYou might be wondering why we haven\u2019t\nmentioned the Greek Salad yet.

We were excited to find out what, with a bit of time and\neffort, can be achieved with the ingredients at\nour disposal.\nThe answer? Quite a lot, however, it all\ncomes at a price; it\u2019s fair to say that eating\nvegan food in Kensington is certainly not helping us to save money. We started off with the\ncashew nut based \u201ccheese trio\u201d which were\nflavoured with mixed herbs, olives and pep-pers. They tasted like a mild cream cheese and\nwe were pretty impressed by how yummy they\nwere. With the \u201ccheeses\u201d came pear chutney,\ngrain crackers and a balsamic vinegar dressing\nand all combined together were very satisfy-ing. It was even possible to forget the absence\nof meat and dairy.\nOnto our mains, we ordered a vegan \u201cPad\nThai\u201d and the pasta of the day. The latter of the\ntwo with its wild mushroom and paprika sauce\nwas a meal that no meat eater would notice as\nbeing vegan. The sauce was creamy (a quality we\u2019ve found to be lacking in much vegan\nfood) and rich. The \u201cPad Thai\u201d on the other\nhand was a completely different story. Firstly\nit was entirely composed of raw vegetables,\nenoki mushrooms and a few cashew nuts in a\ntahini based sauce so was definitely not worth\nthe nearly \u00a315 price tag that it came with. In\naddition its raw nature and the absence of\nthe main ingredients of noodles, chicken and\nprawns meant that by no stretch of the imagination should it have been called a \u201cPad Thai\u201d.\nHowever, if we left this to one side the meal\nwas refreshing and light and certainly left you\nwith a feeling of being healthy (if not entirely\nsatisfied).\nWe walked away from the meal with significantly thinner wallets and a mild sense of\nsatisfaction (although a steak would probably\nhave been tastier!)\nYou can sponsor Hannah and Clare\nat uk.virginmoneygiving.com/team/\ngoingvegan\nVegan recipe: Red Thai Tofu\n4 cloves garlic, minced\n1 tbsp minced fresh ginger\n1 tbsp Thai red curry paste\n\u00bd cup water\n2 tbsp soya sauce\n1 tbsp light agave nectar/pure maple syrup\n15 leaves fresh Thai basil\n1.

But she later\nwent on to receive her\nsecond nomination the\nfollowing year for Kramer\nvs. Kramer and score her\nfirst victory. Hurrah for\nMeryl, in the beginning of\nthe 80s.\nEven to this day, the\nlate Katharine Hepburn\nholds the record for the\nmost acting Oscar wins\n(4), and for one of these\nwins she was in direct\ncompetition with Streep.\nAlthough never acknowledging the glitz of the\nOscars (she never once\nturned up to accept the\naward in person), Hepburn was nevertheless\nhighly respected for her\ncontinuously superb dedication to her craft. Her\nwin for On Golden Pond\nin 1982, over Streep\u2019s\nThe French Lieutenant\u2019s\nWoman was seen as entirely justified, marking\na career-crowning performance for the much-celebrated actress.\nShirley MacLaine was\nno Oscar-magnet either,\nand she had to wait for\nalmost 25 years after her\nfirst nomination for her\neventual win that came\nwith Terms of Endearment in 1984. Accepting\nthe award, she thanked\nthe Academy voters for\nfinally \u201cterminating the\nsuspense.\u201d And it\u2019s a\nperformance that deserves every bit of that\ngolden statuette. Playing\nthe protective mother in\na teary family soap-op-era, she single-handedly\nlifts the film out of its ordinary status. Certainly\na much better choice for\nthe year\u2019s winner than\nStreep\u2019s nominated role\nin Silkwood.\nThe Oscars award perfor-mances, but occasionally\ncan bow down to long\ncareers that have gone\ncriminally unnoticed. This\npartly explains Geraldine Page\u2019s win for The\nTrip to Bountiful. It\u2019s not\na bad performance, but\nperhaps not remarkable\nenough in its own right.\nFor Page, nominated a\nwhopping seven times\nbefore her win in 1986,\nit was about time, but it\nalmost feels like a consolation prize, handed\nout due to the actress\u2019\nage and long-standing\ncareer. Either way, the\nAcademy was clearly was\nimpressed with Page\u2019s\ntrip than Streep\u2019s one\nOut of Africa.\nSurprise! Cher the pop\nsuperstar is also an ac-tress. After she made it\nbig in the music scene,\nshe also ruled the screen\nwith her energetic per-formances. Her most\nfamous Moonstruck in\nwhich she immortalised\nthe line \u201csnap out of it!\u201d,\nwon her the highly undeserving Oscar in 1988.\nLooking amongst the five\nnominated in the catego-ry, (with Streep for Ironweed included) perhaps\nthe most outstanding\nwas Glenn Close in Fatal\nAttraction. The Academy\nvoters clearly couldn\u2019t\nstomach the female villain who has made men\nthink twice about one-night-stands.\n\n"

    "content": "MUSIC\nThis week we\u2019ll be taking a detour into the mysterious world of so-called \u201cmath-core\u201d. Math-core is to\npost-hardcore what Imperial is to UCL: the same,\njust a bit cleverer. There are countless math-core\nbands that have left their mark on post-hardcore\nmusic but the one I\u2019m reviewing this week is rather\nmore low-key, a hidden gem from none other than\nBirmingham.\nBlakfish formed in 2000 as mere schoolchildren\nbut went on to be one of the greatest UK math-core bands of their time, even going on to support Biffy Clyro on a 2010 European Tour. They\nreleased various E.P.s followed by an incredible\nfull-length during their time together. The release\nof their most recent E.P., See You In Another City,\nmade a big impact amongst fans of UK math-core\nfor it\u2019s sarcastic yet catchy lyrics and indie/hard-core hybrid sound. This record saw their popularity\nrise significantly but it wasn\u2019t until the release of\ntheir debut album Champions that they really got a\nglimpse of life as a band outside the underground\nscene\u2026 and they didn\u2019t like it. After the release\nof Champions, Blakfish were performing at much\nbigger shows including Sonisphere and, as mentioned before, the 2010 Biffy Clyro tour. This increase in popularity however meant there was no\ntime left for them to enjoy life and Blakfish ceased\nto exist mid-way through touring with Biffy Clyro.\nNonetheless, Champions lives on and continues to\ninspire math-core fans old and new.\nSYIAC and Champions are both comprised of\nsongs primarily about everyday things that got on\nthe band members\u2019 nerves like driving in London\nor vegetarians. This, along with the genius of the\nlyrics gives the tracks a strange charm, I guarantee that if you listen to their songs you will be\nsinging along to almost every line in agreement.\nTheir sound adds various extra dimensions to the\nmix with heavy riffs and roaring vocals united with\nupbeat choruses and melodies. Their distinctive\nstyle makes this band a definite must for angry\nhardcore-lovers and fans of softer indie alike.\nCheck out the recommendations and if you like\nwhat you hear then buy the album, it\u2019s more than\nworth it!\nWriter\u2019s Recommendations\n1: Listen to \u2018Your Hair\u2019s Straight But Your Boyfriend\nAin\u2019t\u2019. It\u2019s basically just Blakfish moaning about\nfashion. Brilliant.\n2: Listen to Blakfish\u2019s true Christmas anthem \u2018The\nTrue Meaning of Christmas\u2019\nGeorge Jeffery\u2019s\nA beginner\u2019s guide to\npost-hardcore\nLesson 8: Blakfish\nFELIX Friday 02 MARCH 2012 31\nthetic reaction to the crowd (highlighted by his\nresponse to hecklers, \u201cI\u2019ve already played that\nsong, man\u201d). We truly admired the psychedelic\nramblings of this stoner-tinged troubadour and\nwould recommend the latest album to anyone\ncraving a modern classic. What a man!\n*Music journalism is our unspecified drug here.\nseeing for the past two months\u2026 Vile. After a\nfew songs, though, we were drawn in by his \u201cIdon\u2019t-give-a-shit\u201d stoner attitude; an approach\nwe found refreshing, with all the try-hards like\nAdele smothering the charts. His set-list drew\nheavily from his latest release but it was good to\nhear some of his older material.\nOne of the highlights of the night was a cover\nof Springsteen\u2019s \u2018Downbound Train\u2019 which\nsimply blew us away. We found that Kurt Vile\nexcels at stripped-back mellow numbers. The\nintimacy of \u2018Peeping Tom\u2019was a prime example\nwith soft, soothing yet dark undertones ringing\nthroughout the performance. There was a feeling that the lyrics were lost beneath the fuzzy\nreverb at the venue and not to mention his lovely\nflowing locks. However, he surpassed himself\nwith standout tracks \u2018Smoke Ring For My Halo\u2019\nand \u2018Jesus Fever\u2019 which both blossomed into\ntwo magnificent moments. Noise regulations\nforced him to cut his encore short and to our\ndismay, he did not get the time to play \u2018Society\nIs My Friend\u2019, a song our drug* addled brains\nwere aching to hear. He did reconcile this by\nsticking around and talking to fans afterwards.\nSo we came to enjoy Vile\u2019s performance as\nthe night progressed. He did not come off well\nat first but gradually we fell in love with the\nenormous presence of his voice and his apa-W\ne are going to start this review with a bold statement:\nKurt Vile\u2019s Smoke Rings\nfor my Halo was the hottest\nalbum of 2011. No matter\nhow poignant PJ Harvey\u2019s Let England Shake\nwas or how acclaimed the Horror\u2019s Skying was,\nno-one can convince us otherwise. It was with\nthis in mind that we headed to Koko on 21 February for the NME awards with high expectations in mind.\nVile is a chilled out motherfucker, a true trou-badour. Born on the streets of Philadelphia, he\nhas lived a hectic life up until now, originally\nbeing part of The War On Drugs followed by\nconstant touring with his backing band The\nViolators. Tuneful yet sporadic, his music combines the spirited choruses of Springsteen with\nlo-fi leanings of SonicYouth. But you can\u2019t just\nlimit the man\u2019s genius with a couple of influ-ences. His unique sound, helped by his hypno-tising, yet engaging, care-free voice, allows you\nto fully appreciate the powerful imagery his lyrics conjure up.\nAs we walked in to the bustling venue, we\nheard the senile caterwaulings of a distressed\nbusker. \u201cThe support band is terrible,\u201d we simultaneously thought. Yet to our horror, it\nwas the man we had been looking forward to\nKurt Vile, what a man!\nKurt Vile, we like your style\nMohammad Mirza and Mark England have a blast in Camden\nRama\u2019s Hip-Hop\nTune of the Week\nUntil very recently my knowledge of Tyga extended to the facts that he was behind the less\nthan impressive song \u2018Coconut Juice\u2019 and that\nhe had a fair few tattoos. I certainly would not\nhave expected him to be releasing a track with\ntwo of the greatest lyricists in hip-hop.\nYou can therefore imagine my surprise when\nthe song \u2018King and Queens\u2019, surfaced featuring guest verses from Wale and Nas. With\nsoulful production by The Olympicks, Tyga\nand Wale both present solid verses. The song\nis rumoured to be off his forthcoming album\nCareless World. The highlight of the track for\nme, however, is the tight verse by a resurgent\nNas. If he maintains his current run of quality\noutput, Life is Good should be very exciting.\nTyga ft. Nas & Wale\n\u2018King and Queens\u2019\nI want this shirt\notherwise awesome gig. It\u2019s length. To call\nthe gig brief would be an understatement.\nAzealia\u2019s set lasted less about 30 minutes. Admittedly for an artist who is yet to release their\ndebut album this is not entirely unexpected, I\njust wanted more.\nfrom our goal, we only had eyes for Azealia.\nIn true testament to our careful planning,\nnot long after our arrival the lights dimmed\nand the sweet sounds of The Prodigy alerted\nus that Miss Banks would soon be on stage. A\nbrief foray into Basement Jaxx and then there\nshe was wearing a chinese style silk dress and\nwielding a confetti cannon.\nHer show was quite literally an attack on the\nsenses. Azealia\u2019s rapping was on-point being\nloud, fast and fluid. Ignore the video of her performing at Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s house, this girl is\ngood live, and unlike many better known rappers she had no need for a hype man. There\nwas a pretty awesome light show, a costume\nchange and when she performed \u2018212\u2019 balloons poured down from the ceiling of Heaven.\nThere was one downside, however, to this\nSince the first time I saw the video for \u2018L8R\u2019\nin 2010, I have been riding the Azealia Banks\ntrain pretty hard, falling more in love with her\nwith each new song that she releases. It was\ntherefore only natural that when I got wind of\nher doing a show at Heaven I jumped at the\nopportunity and convinced one of my housemates to come along for the ride.\nWe arrived at Heaven having missed all the\nsupport acts and were greeted by the sight of\nfree candyfloss, but not even this distracted us\nAzealia Banks\nAlex Ramadan\nFlailing hand guns or peace signs?\n\n"

The\nmain aim of the event was \u201cto foster a\ncloser relationship between the capital\u2019s student population\u201c. However,\nthe success of the event is yet to be\nestablished. It remains to be revealed\nthe exact gain or loss from the event,\nwhich was a joint student venture between the unions of Imperial College\nLondon, King\u2019s College London, and\nUniversity College London.\nAs of writing, the number of tickets\nsold for the first time London event is\nunknown. After numerous attempts to\ncontact the event organiser, founder,\nand President, Angela Udemba, Felix was unable to gain any information pertaining to the financial state\nof the event. Angela went on to re-spond: \u201cI don\u2019t yet know exactly how\nmany tickets were sold and how much\nmoney we made\u201d. The treasurer of the\nevent, Heather Jones, echoed these\nsentiments, saying that, at the present\ntime, \u201cit\u2019s basically impossible to give\nan accurate gain/loss figure\u201d. When\nquestioned, Michael Foster, Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services), did\nnot have any details on the matter.\nThe current loss (as reported via\neActivities, the Union\u2019s Club and Society live financial reporting system)\nof the event stands at \u00a323,473.70. This\nincludes the successful launch event\n(generating a surplus of \u00a34,548.46)\nbut does not include the income generated by ticket sales.\nThe event spanning the weekend of\n25 and 26 Feburary was held at Troxy,\na well established venue situated in\nLimehouse, and had a maximum capacity of approximately 4,000. At the\ntime of publication the ticket income\nhas yet to appear on the Union sys-tem.\nWhen seeking clarity from the Students\u2019 Union of University College\nLondon (one of the joint partners of\nthe Fusion@London), Felix received\na reply stating that \u201cUCLU was not\ninvolved in the planning or financial\nresponsibility for the event.\u201d King\u2019s\nCollege London Students\u2019 Union gave\nno statement. Following reports to the\nUnion\u2019s Executive Committee, it is\nnow know that no financial liability\nwas placed on any party other than\nImperial College Union.\nFelix is seeking to clarify the present situation over the next week.\nTim Arbabzadah\nConFusion over event success\nClarification sought over joint university venture\nRavi Pall\nand raised the issue at their Sports User\nGroup Meeting on 14 February. Despite\ntheir efforts, the initial response was that\nthey would not reconsider. After Chair of\nthe Recreational Clubs Committee (RCC)\nDominic Andradi-Brown gave a report at\nthe RCC General Meeting on 16 February, a severe backlash occurred along\nwith the creation of the online petition.\nYears of not charging and pressure\nincreasingly mounting last week caused\nstudents to hold a meeting which resulted in Sport Imperial rescinding the\ncharges. Also, they agreed to continue\nto let outdoor clubs use the mountain\nhut free. Notably, they introduced the\ncondition that they produce a sport/club\ndevelopment plan. Numbers for free\nweekend bookings will be allocated\nannually after this is reviewed based\non how often the club uses it. Instead,\nfor clubs which do not include use of\nthe hut as a core activity (at least once\nannually), the \u00a350 booking charge re-mains.\nNumerous clubs associated with the\nRCC already face an increase in costs of\nrunning trips, with the Union increasing\ncharges to hire minibuses and fuel pric-es. A final comment from Brown noted\nthat \u201ctrying to stay true to the core RCC\nrecreation sports value of providing\ncheap opportunities for students to get\nout of London and get involved in an\nactivity is becoming increasingly challenging\u201d, and many clubs have had to\nincrease their trip costs this year.

    "content": "Happy with your sex life?\nA comment on the survey \u2013 and how it compares to last year\n2x\nNUMBER OF\nRESPONDENTS\nthis time around. Missed by some\nparticipants was the question on sex\ntoys, but in general the ethos for this\nyear\u2019s version was \u201cmore\u201d. We strived\nfor a finer granularity of data than\nbefore, and it is this \u2013 along with the\nincrease of people willing to fill out the\nsurvey \u2013 that allows us to bring you\nthis eight-page bonanza of analysis.\nOf course, the survey can still\nbe improved. While we are very\npleased with the increased number\nof respondents, it is clear that there\nremains a trust barrier when it comes\nto the survey. This is something we\nwould ideally like to overcome, and\nI would stress again that the data is\ncompletely anonymous.\n\u201cThe survey itself\nalso differed this\ntime around\u201d\nOne consideration for any future\neditions might be to allow students\nto view the survey before logging\nin. Perhaps knowing the questions\nin advance \u2013 and being able to see\nthe \u201cdo not wish to say\u201d option \u2013 will\nmake them feel more comfortable\nabout participating.\nReturning to the comparison with\nlast year,perhaps the best comparison\nwe can make is again one of \u201cmore\u201d.\nWe have done our best in this pull\nout to provide you with the most\ninteresting data and correlations we\ncould find, and we hope this increased\noutput is of as much interest to you\nas last year.\n\u201cmost of the analyses carried out both\nyears show very similar results\u201d\n(from lowest to highest) have changed,\nas you can see in our centrefold.\nWhat is interesting about this\nparticular statistic is that most of the\npercentages have increased. It is nice\nto see that there are more virgins who\nare happy to say so this time around.\nThe survey itself also differed\nF\nantastically, there were twice\nas many respondents this\nyear, which has allowed us\nto go into much more detail\nthis time around. On the other hand, that makes it rather difficult\nto compare many of our analyses, as\nthere is nothing to compare against.\nAn interesting point to note is the\nlarge fresher bias we had this year.\nLast time the majority of respondents\nwere in their third or fourth year \u2013\nattributed to the influence of Felix\nEditors and their social links. Any\nreasoning on my part as to why this is\nwould be purely conjecture \u2013 perhaps\ncurrent first years are more sexually\nactive and hence more likely to fill out\nthe survey.\nOther than that, most of the\nanalyses carried out both years show\nvery similar results. This includes,\nhowever, the fact that the majority of\nour respondents were not virgins \u2013\nwhich skews how much we can rely\non this data representing Imperial\nas a whole. Barring that, it is good to\nsee that our results this year enforce\nthe relevance of those from the debut\nsurvey.\nThere are some statistics that have\nvaried this year, outside a sensible\nmargin of error. However, it is with\ncaution that we would put much\nemphasis on these changes. Many\nof the respondents from last year\nmay very well have been in their final\nyear, and the large percentage of first-year respondents this year obviously\nrepresents brand-new data.\nOne such statistic is the percentage\nof virgins per department. It is difficult\nto say why this is the case, but both\nthe percentages and the ordering\n3\nFELIXSEXSURVEY2012\nOF RESPONDENTS ARE\nFRESHERS\nOF RESPONDENTS ARE\nVIRGINS\n18%\n32%\nA\nnd the winners for sex life\nsatisfaction by department\nthis year are the Materials\ndepartment, with 73% of\ntheir respondents being\neither happy or very happy with their\nsex life. Notably, there is a larger proportion of Bioengineers that are in a\nrelationship than are happy or very\nhappy with their sex life. Does this\nsuggest that the partners of bioengineering students are terrible in bed?\nOr that bioengineers have incredibly\nhigh standards for their sex life? Potentially. It is interesting to note, how-ever, that bioengineers have the second lowest proportion of people in a\nrelationship who are in a relationship\nwith a fellow Imperial student. Perhaps it is fairer to conclude that the\nfact that a lot of bioengineering students have potentially long distance\nrelationships is why they are unhappy\nwith their sex life.\nAll values are percentages Positive Neutral Negative\nMATERIALS 73 17 10\nCIVIL ENGINEERING 67 28 05\nEARTH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 64 27 11\nPHYSICS 61 25 14\nLIFE SCIENCES 61 27 13\nMATHEMATICS 58 26 16\nCOMPUTING 56 33 11\nCHEMISTRY 56 35 09\nMEDICINE 54 32 15\nCHEMICAL ENGINEERING 51 38 11\nAERONAUTICS 48 41 11\nMECHANICAL ENGINEERING 46 38 15\nEEE 45 36 19\nBIOENGINEERING 39 45 15\nDoes Imperial negatively\naffect your sex life?\nStrongly Somewhat Slightly Not really Quite the\ncontrary\nResponses\nPeople who feel that Imperial does\nnot affect their sex life have 51% of\nthe vote. Does this mean we can\ndefinitively disprove the theory that\nImperial Students are sex deprived and\nmad about it?\nA pessimist would say no,and there\u2019s\na lot of evidence for them to make\ntheir case. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this\n50:50 split is almost identical to the\none observed in the total number of\nrespondents who are in a relationship.\nBecause our survey has a bias in\nattracting people who are happy in\ntheir sex life, perhaps we are getting\nan un-representatively happy view of\nImperial\u2019s sex life.\nYour correspondent, however, would\nlike to take the positive outlook on\nlife, and certainly wouldn\u2019t want to\nencourage self-fulfilling despondency.\nThe Materials department, who\nhave the highest sex life satisfaction\ndespite having the lowest proportion\nof students in a relationship with an\nimperial college student, seem to have\nthe answer. Perhaps if you\u2019re feeling a\nlittle lonely you should get an RSM wing\nman.\nOn a final note, and of importance to\nCollege and the Union,25% of students\ntaking our survey said that their sex life\nat Imperial had, or would, negatively\naffect their answer to the National\nStudent Survey. Seeing as college is on\na large drive at the moment to improve\nImperial\u2019s currently dire standing in this\nmetric, perhaps opening a department\nof English Literature, Psychology or\nVetinary Medicine would help.\nAll values are percentages In a relationship With an Imperial student\nMATERIALS 67 04\nEARTH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 65 05\nCIVIL ENGINEERING 60 06\nPHYSICS 52 19\nMATHEMATICS 52 10\nLIFE SCIENCES 52 14\nCOMPUTING 51 07\nMEDICINE 48 14\nCHEMISTRY 47 07\nMECHANICAL ENGINEERING 46 04\nBIOENGINEERING 42 02\nCHEMICAL ENGINEERING 41 03\nAERONAUTICS 37 02\nEEE 35 02\n\n"

Maybe in a few years\ntime that\u2019s something which should be\nconsidered, but right now the role isn\u2019t\nlarge enough to be a sabbatical.\nWhy wasn\u2019t CGCU involved in your\nICSM v RCSU pub quiz?\nWe did ask them if they wanted to be\ninvolved and they didn\u2019t get back to\nus.\nWhen will we see more collaboration\nwith the CGCU?\nWe\u2019ve got our Tri-Union Boat Party\ncoming up on March 14th which is\nwith both the RSM and CGCU.\nWhat\u2019s been the key to ensuring the\nsuccess of the string of events you\u2019ve\nheld this year?\nPlanning them early and ensuring\nthey\u2019re good value for money I think\nhas been the key.\nIs RCSU really the only unpaid faculty president?\nThere are only three faculty union\u2019s,\nthe RCSU, the CGCU and the ICSMSU and of these the ICSMSU is\na sabbatical position and the CGCU\nPresident receives some money for\ntheir work. The RCSU President traditionally does significantly more than\nthe CGCU President, but is completely\nunpaid. To be honest though I don\u2019t really think it should be a paid position.\nHow have you delivered on your\nmanifesto points so far?\nMy main manifesto point was to bring\nback the RCSU beer festival, which we\ndid at the RCSU Oktoberfest last term.\nThis wasn\u2019t quite on the scale I\u2019d have\nliked but with the Union\u2019s new responsible drinking policy it was really the\nbest we could do. Hopefully this will\nbecome a yearly event and will be\nsomething next years committee can\nbuild on.\nWhat would you say to people intending to run for your role?\nThe main thing I\u2019d say is to think about\nwhether you think you can spare the\ntime. It really is a big commitment but\neasily the best thing I\u2019ve done in my\nfour years at Imperial.\nThis year\u2019s Imperial College Union elections include Faculty Union Presidents in\nthe line-up for the first time. Felix speaks to the outgoing officers\nLuke Kanczes \u2013\nRoyal College of Science\nUnion (RCSU) President\nWhat do you find most interesting\nabout your role?\nThe most interesting part of being in\nthis role is the opportunity to meet with\nlots of different people. It is amazing to have the opportunity to discuss\nideas with Directors of Undergraduate Studies, Heads of Departments\nand sometimes with the Principle and\neven the Rector! This role also allows\nyou to meet with distinguished alumni\nwithin the vast C&G network. I have\nbeen learning an enormous amount\nfrom talking with them and I benefit\nhugely from it.\nHow have you improved the CGCU\u2019s presence at college?\nWe produced 1,000 CGCU handbooks\nthis year to educate students about\nCGCU, our traditions and embrace\nour identity as Imperial Engineers. In\naddition to that, the executive commit-tee, the dep reps and dep soc chairs\nhave organised short 30 minute long\nlectures at the beginning of the year in\neach engineering department to inform\nstudents who the reps are and what we\ndo.\nDo you feel the CGCU\u2019s run events\nmore competitively against the\nRCSU this year?\nYes, most certainly. In addition to the\ntraditional events, such as club nights\nat Archangel and the London Brighton\nrun, the flagship freshers\u2019 event \u2013 the\nWelcome dinner at Caf\u00e9 de Paris was\nbigger and better than ever before.\nWe had a fantastic attendance of more\nthan 600, supported by students and\nstaff, testing the capacity of 700. This\nevent marked a start of a series of fantastic events and this is something that\nthe CGCU is determined to carry on\n- to bring better and more affordable\nevents to the engineering students.\nDoes the rivalry between faculty\nunions extend to the CGCU offices?\nA significant part of the competitive\nrivalry originates from Mascotry. For\nthose who are not familiar with the\ntopic, the practice of Mascotry revolves around stealing the mascot of\nour rivals which include the Medics,\nScientist and Miners. Then holding\nthem for ransom where the money is\ngiven to RAG.\nA popular location of the Mascots\nhiding place is inside their respective\nunion\u2019s office. The CGCU exec committee has to keep an eye out for suspicious scientist and miners lurking\noutside the CGCU office!!\nWhat\u2019s an average week like in the\nCGCU office?\nA typical week largely consists of representing the engineering students at\nlots of different areas: academically,\nprofessionally and socially to the col-lege, union, alumni bodies and external companies. This comes in in the\nform of lots of scheduled meetings and\ncalls. In these meetings, I voice the\nstudents\u2019 views on important topics\nand discuss and decide the engineering\nfaculty union\u2019s position on the matter.\nI am also responsible to manage with\nadmin requests from the CGCU management group, i.e. requests from engineering departmental societies and\nengineering clubs on a daily basis.\nWhy should people get involved\nwith the CGCU?\nIf you have always wondered what it\u2019s\nlike to be involved in such a successful\norganisation and to be involved with\nthe organisation of huge events then\nthis is your chance! It is great fun to\nbe on the committee and is a really\nrewarding challenge. Especially those\nin 1st and 2nd years don\u2019t be shy to\napply!\nWhat advice would you give to\nsomeone who was thinking of running for a CGCU position?\nCGCU is by far the biggest faculty\nout of the three and as President you\nare ultimately responsible for approximately 6,000 students, 44% of Imperial. The President must ensure the large\nexecutive committee is run smoothly\nthrough regular meetings, and they\nshould try to get the most out of exec\nmembers. As President you oversee\nall of the different subsections of the\ncommittee including events, industrial\nrelations, alumni relations, finance,\nengineering representation and sport.\nThis means that the President will be\nheavily involved with all aspects of\nthe faculty union from securing and\nmanaging relationships with sponsors\nand companies, arranging contractual\nagreements for events, budgeting and\nmaintaining a strong relationship with\nthe college, union and alumni. The role\nrequires a natural leader who is very\ngood at building strong relationships\nand managing their time effectively, it\nis very demanding however extremely\nrewarding and a great honour which\nopens doors for you!\nJacky Kwan \u2013\nCity and Guilds College\nUnion (CGCU) President\nStand for election at imperialcollegeunion.org/elections\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX Friday 02 MARCH 2012 7\nman. However I have always felt the\nimportant part of that process is not\nto regret and overthink things, but to\nwalk through the process, ensure you\nlearn lessons and disseminate that wis-dom.\nDo you feel that publicising your\nachievements is in some ways a dif-ficulty?\nIt has always been, and will always\nbe, difficult to champion the personal\nsuccesses and Union successes. However I do feel I have made it a little\neasier.\nOne of the first things I did, after\nsecuring funding for the benches and\nnew bins in the quad and getting it\nrepaved, was to request a better Sabbatical Blogging system. It looks bet-ter, it\u2019s easy to use and provides a great\nplatform to talking about successes we\nhave had.\nI am also creating and soon to release\na Union Impact Report, which will be\ncalled \u2018The Review.\u2019 This is designed\nto publicise the wider impacts that the\nUnion and its activities have; all in one\nconvenient location.\nWhat tends to be the problem is that\nsome of our achievements are hard to\ncommunicate easily. Securing a seat\nat the Strategic Education Committee, something we have been trying\nto do for 8 years, means very little to\nthe average student even though the\neffects being large \u2013 this is the Committee which saw the Life Science\nRestructure plans first! And what ends\nup happening is you weigh up whether\nit\u2019s better to spend a large amount of\nyour time championing what we have\ndone, explaining its importance, etc. or\njust getting on with achieving more for\nthe Students. And often, but not all the\ntime, the primary wins.\nF: Do you feel that the Union could\nhave benefited at all from taking a\ndefinite standpoint on student protests earlier this year?\nS: It is my belief that we didn\u2019t voice\nour disapproval enough about the cuts\nto UK Science Funding last year; especially as its effects on our PhD students and the University funding has\nbeen significant.\nHowever I think it is fair to say a\nlot of our student body, especially the\nStudent Council, has not been eager to\ntake to the streets over these changes.\nWhat I will say is that we, as a\nUnion, have never really considered\nwhether we should use our voice to\nsupport national campaigns that don\u2019t\noverly affect us. A prime example of\nthis is the EMA cut.\nF: What is your stance on Clayponds?\nS: I am still very disappointed with the\nCollege for their underhand approach\nto the Clayponds closure. This was another example of where the Management Board makes a decision and then\nrealises the effects afterwards. For\nexample, nobody has thought about\nthe wardening structure that exists in\nClayponds and whether this will move\nto Orient House; nobody has worked\nout the prices for this accommodation\nto ensure that we still have cheap accommodation options for our PG students and nobody consulted the Union\nuntil after the decision was made!\nAfter this I pushed hard to ensure\nthat the Union guarantees input into\nMB decisions which we feel affects\nstudents; not what College believes\ndoes. I raised this at College Council\nand the concession I received was that\nthe meeting agenda and papers will be\nmade available to the Union for comment before their meetings.\nThough this will provide some good\nUnion oversight it still doesn\u2019t guarantee us a voice in the room.\nWhat I do find comical about this\nwhole situation is that it is the Union\nreminding the College that it should\nconsider the risks of its actions and\nassess the effects of its decision before making them \u2013 many people I am\nsure would imagine it would be the\nreverse!\nF: What is your stance on the Holland Club?\nS: As I stated earlier in this interview,\nthis situation is a complete PR disaster\nfor the College and another situation\nthat unnecessarily blew out of propor-tion.\nWhen this was brought to the\nUnion\u2019s attention in January I stated to\nFelix that my priorities were to make\nsure that the Students had a seat at the\ntable and that any space designated for\nstudents would have to be influenced\nand managed by students.\nThis week it was confirmed by the\nCollege that the plans are moving\nforward and a task group has been\nformed. It is made up of three people:\nthe member of the Holland Club com-mittee, a Senior Dean and myself.\nOne thing that is essential is that\nany changes to this space do not deter\npeople from using it. There is no gain\nto any student or staff member of this\nCollege if a popular social space is\nchanged into an area that no one wants\nto use.\nWe were aware that the PRB meeting would take place last Friday but\nthe Union was informed that it could\nnot attend. As such we submitted a\ndocument. I stated, clearly, that we\nwould welcome a space that could be\nprovided to PGT students which they\ncould call their own and that we had\nconcerns about accessibility. I also\nhighlighted that we had no issues with\nthe Holland Club\u2019s Bar area but felt\nthat the under-utilized snooker and\nmeeting rooms could be used more efficiently in a campus which is so desperate for space.\nF: Why should people be interested\nin running for President?\nS: This is a question I get asked frequently and there is one simple an-swer: to make a difference. My role is\nthe most varied of the Sabbatical team\nand it has lots of scope to make it your\nown. When I started I never imagined\ndoing half of the things I have done\nand I have enjoyed every minute of it.\nThere really is nothing more satisfying that improving the University experience for the student body.\nAnd next year is going to be a really\ninteresting year. We will have the first\nyear of students paying the \u00a39,000\nfee entering the University; you can\nguarantee there will be a new government policy to respond to and the City\nis hosting the Olympics. It certainly\nwon\u2019t be a boring time!\nF: What advice would you give to\nsomeone who was thinking of running for President?\nS: Stop thinking \u2013 start doing!\nrial College Union President\nto higher education and to Imperial College itself\n\u201cThe [Holland Club]\nsituation is a complete PR disaster for\nthe College\u201d\n\n"
