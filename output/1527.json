This\nweek, after a brief sabbatical from my literary\nendeavors, I return once again \u2013 but this time\n(perhaps surprisingly) on the side of the majority.\nIn a recent poll, just 19% of those questioned believed that bene\ufb01ts were too low; compared with\n62% who felt spending on welfare needed to be\nreined in.\nAt the end of the 2010/11 tax year, the Government had spent \u00a3202.6 billion on the welfare sys-tem. Considering the total spending budget was\n\u00a3701.7 billion, and the fact that only around \u00a3500\nbillion of tax revenue was collected in same peri-od, the cost of welfare handouts and ensuing debate is not a topic to be sco\ufb00ed at lightly. It does\nnot take much mathematical acuity to notice that\nthese numbers don\u2019t add up: the Treasury\u2019s books\ndon\u2019t tally, not by a long way. In fact, this de\ufb01cit\nis being plugged by record levels of borrowing,\nwhich in the current economic market has a gargantuan cost. The interest on debt for this \ufb01nancial year was nearly \u00a343 billion, and will continue\nto rise until this imbalance is corrected. This is\nnot sustainable, and so by consequence, nor is the\nwelfare system. Reform is desperately needed.\nThe idea that anyone should receive something\nfor nothing de\ufb01es any sensible logic. Especially\nhere, where many of you freshers are paying sky-high fees to garner the privilege of a university\neducation; accruing vast amounts of debt in the\nhope that one day your future earning power will\nbe su\ufb03cient enough to pay it all o\ufb00, this is a ridiculous proposition. Why should anybody cruise\nthrough life on the back of free money, courtesy\nof the hard working members of this society?\nOne might ask how we found ourselves in this\nmess in the \ufb01rst place? Well, like many other\nproblems with the UK, this can be blamed on the\nprevious Labour governments. Firstly, the new\ngovernment of 1997 failed to reform the system\nafter not having the balls (pardon the expression)\nto force the legislation through Parliament after a\nfew nutcase protesters chained themselves to the\nrailings of Downing Street. With hindsight, it is\nobvious to see that, like many of these childish\nprotests (Occupy included), their removal should\nhave been ordered \u2018tout suite\u2019 by the authorities\nand civilized order restored. There is no place for\nlouts like that in modern society (but more on\nthis another time). However, it was the Brown\nadministration\u2019s failure to address the problem\n(in a failed bid to gain support amongst the more\nignorant) that led to the costs of welfare rising\nto unsustainable levels. Instead, in a move to lift\nas many people as possible above the EU\u2019s o\ufb03cial de\ufb01nition of poverty, this government raised\nbene\ufb01t payments by miniscule amounts to create a few quotable statistics.\nIn terms of the recent Act, the primary purpose of the legislation is an annual welfare cap\nof \u00a326,000. One does not have to muster great\nintellectual capacity to realize that this is by far\nenough \u2013 too much, even. Even living in London it is possible to live on less than \u00a320,000,\nand that\u2019s a very conservative estimate based\non the London Living Wage \u2013 a well-known\nbenchmark for an acceptable standard of life.\nOf course, this isn\u2019t a copious amount of money,\nthough it follows that if one is struggling to live\non this amount, then it may be prudent to stop\nspending money on frivolities such as alcohol\nand cigarettes (which are \u2013 contrary to some beliefs \u2013 not an essential item), cut back on other\nextraneous costs such as Sky TV, and cease buying whatever other \u2018bling\u2019 the latest Argos catalogue is spewing forth into today\u2019s homes. And\nmaybe, just maybe, get a job. It\u2019s not as if it\u2019s a\nright to have all these trappings of \u2018luxury\u2019 life\nfunded by the hardworking taxpayer, who actually has to get o\ufb00 the sofa each morning to do\nmore than just get another beer out of the fridge.\nAt the recent budget, George Osborne predicted that, even taking into account the Welfare\nReform Act, the welfare budget would grow to\nbe one third of total government spending by\n2015. For a country running at a considerable\nde\ufb01cit, at a time when the world economy is in\nits worst shape since the Great Depression, this\nis a completely nonsensical position. Put simply,\nthe country cannot a\ufb00ord it, and it is certainly\nnot a necessary expenditure. The last 30 years\nhas seen the United Kingdom become a nation\ntoo dependent on the State, mostly due to the\nvote grabbing, short-term policies of successive\nLabour governments. Now \ufb01nally, as the people\nawaken to realise the catastrophic situation they\n\ufb01nd the country in, we need to wean the parasitic few o\ufb00 this unnecessary lifeline. Welfare\nreform could not come too soon, nor can it go\ntoo far.\nhe current and proposed welfare reforms are a masterclass in post-Blair\nspin. Not only is the media awash\nwith willingly repeated misinformation from the government but even\nthe name, \u201creform\u201d\n, attempts to re-brand what\nare actually violent attacks on the poorest in our\nsociety. \u2018Welfare reform\u2019 suggests improvement,\nnot the complete dismantling of support and the\ncontinued transition of a system \u2013 meant by name\nto be for care \u2013 into one whose sole purpose is\npunishment.\nWhilst people wait in dreaded apprehension of\nchanges coming in April to housing bene\ufb01t and\ncouncil tax, which will drive them deeper into\npoverty and out of their homes, this government\nhas not even gone through the etiquette of primary legislation to already force through other major\nchanges to our welfare system. No thanks to Labour who put the starting blocks in place for them.\nThese cruel changes have been seen in the lightning roll-out of \u201cworkfare\u201d\n, sanctions and Atos assessments for those claiming to be un\ufb01t for work.\nOne workfare scheme saw nearly 50% of the\npeople referred on to it drop o\ufb00 the welfare rolls\nin the run-up to starting the forced, unpaid work.\nThe majority will now have to survive on nothing.\nThe government\u2019s response to this data was merely\nto expand the scheme as they said it showed it was\nworking. And if they cannot indirectly force you\no\ufb00 the bene\ufb01t you are entitled to when in need,\nthey will kick you o\ufb00 by just taking your money\naway using sanctions. These have been shown in\na Guardian investigation to be targeted at those\nwith learning disabilities and mental illness as Job\nCentre sta\ufb00 were forced to meet government imposed targets. The use of arbitrary targets to deny\npeople vital bene\ufb01ts has also been found to be the\ncentre of the humiliating assessments carried out\nby Atos on people\u2019s ability to work \u2013 leaving half\nof all people deemed \ufb01t for work with no bene\ufb01t\nat all.\nThis willingness to whip away the meagre support demonstrates either absurd naivety, or pure\ncruelty from those in power. From statements it\nis assumed that either people are working in an\napparently booming black market (an explanation\nthat fraud \ufb01gures seem to contradict) or the lack\nof money causes a job to appear from no where\nin this dead economy. These fairytale endings to\na punitive welfare system are a signal of how detached from modern life politicians are. The reality is that of a 30 year old man I met who had to\ngo foraging for food or the thousands \ufb02ooding\nto food banks each week as they have literally no\nother way to survive.\nAlthough David Cameron championed the disturbing growth of food banks this takes away the\nvaguely reliable support of the welfare state and\nreplaces it with ad hoc and uncoordinated char-ity. Not only is charity accompanied with a giant\ndollop of judgment and moralising that Orwell\nwas only too aware of (though it\u2019s not like this\nis absent from the job centre either) but also it\nis only there at the will of the providers and not\nfor those in need. Too often food banks have bare\nshelves as donations are too small and the need\ntoo great. Nearly all limit people to only 3 claims,\nwhich with the maximum sanctions going up to\n3 years will barely get people through a month of\ntheir 36 months of punishment. The replacement\nof state support by charities has had tragic consequences in the death of an immigrant child and\nmother which has been brought to light by Westminster council. Not provided with the welfare\nto survive they were left to an inadequate charity system that ended with the child starving. As\nLambeth council prepare to provide direct funding to local food banks as they simultaneously cut\ncouncil tax bene\ufb01t the case of the asylum seekers\nin Westminster paint a bleak picture of the future\nof welfare under these \u201creforms\u201d\n.\nAs support at the bottom is ripped away in the\nname of \u201cbudgetary responsibility\u201d private companies are happily lapping up this welfare cash.\nCompanies such as Argos are replacing sta\ufb00 with\njob seekers, paid for out of the bene\ufb01ts budget.\nThe work programme, a monumental failure at\ngetting people into work that has managed to\nmiss even the employment targets that were expected if no money was spent at all, is sending \u00a35\nbillion the way of companies \u2013 many of whom\nhave had fraud allegations against them as they\nseek to steal more money. Atos is also making a\nround \u00a3100 million from denying disabled people vital funds whilst McDonald\u2019s slyly pocketed\n\u00a310 million from an employment scheme without\ncreating a single job. And as Cameron announces\n\u00a310 billion pounds of fresh welfare cuts at the\nparty conference last week he\u2019s giving the \ufb01nal\ngo ahead for \u00a32 billion pounds to be splashed\non IT companies putting together the doomed\nuniversal credit. These handouts are not a sign of\nausterity, but as social insecurity soars from these\n\u201creforms\u201d we will be left with only a corporate\nwelfare system.\nT\nF\nThename\n\u201creform\u201dattempts\ntore-brand\nviolentattackson\nthepoorest\n\u201c\u201d\nWelfare reform\ncould not come\ntoo soon, nor\ncould it go too\nfar\n\u201d\nand\nnd\nattackson\nattackson\nrest\nest\n\u201c\nThename\nThenam\n\u201creform\u201dat\n\u201creform\u201dat\nt b d\nt b\n\n"

Most tablets speakers are good at\nsounding tinny, but not much else, and\nhere Amazon is trying to change the\ngame! Working with Dolby, they have\nadded speakers that try to achieve that\neardrum-bursting surround sound that\nDolby usually achieves. Once we get our\nhands on this device we hope to con\ufb01rm\nthat this coming together has worked!\nOn the software side the Kindle uses\na highly modi\ufb01ed version of Android\n4.0, also known as Ice Cream Sandwich,\nwhich is almost unrecognisable from\nthe original, and from that you can draw\nthe conclusion that Jelly Bean and further iterations of Android will probably\nnot come to the Fire HD anytime soon.\nHowever, Amazon tries to make up with\nthat with free unlimited cloud storage for all your Amazon content. This\nmay seem limiting, but when you own\na Kindle you end up only buying from\nAmazon. Talking about buying, the Fire\nHD has a huge library of ebooks, movies\nand music, which is to be expected. It\u2019s\nin the app department where Amazon\nfails to be strong. Since the Fire HD (all\nKindlesasamatteroffact)don\u2019thaveaccess to the Google Play store, they are all\nlimited to the Amazon app store, which\nonly has...(drum roll)...50,000 apps. That\nmay sound like a lot, but when you think\nthat ios has 250,000 iPad apps alone, it\u2019s\nquite meagre.\nAll in all, the Amazon Kindle does\ncater to all other needs and at its cost of\n\u00a3159forthe16GBand\u00a3199forthe32GB\n(with sponsored screen savers!) it\u2019s quite\na good deal, and if you have an Amazon\nprime membership you get to download\nebooks for free.

So to help you get an idea, here are 4 budget tablets that might tickle your fancy!\nS\niPad Mini\nO\nT\nn the 18th of October\n2010, Steve Jobs famously\nsaid: \u201cseven inch tablets\nshould come with sand-paper, so users can \ufb01le\ntheir \ufb01ngers down.\u201d Now, almost two\nyears to the day, the Apple rumour mill\nis going crazy about what will be released\nwithin the next weeks. Yes ladies and\ngentlemen, it seems Apple is releasing a 7\ninch tablet. However, will this be the end\nof Apple and their marketing genius?\nThe new iPad, referred to as the iPad\nMini or iPad Air is not yet released, and\no\ufb03cially Apple denies its existence. So all\nI can relay here are rumours painstakingly gathered from the internet.\nFirst to the basics, Mini is rumoured\nto be a 7.85 inch (diagonally) tablet with\na screen resolution similar to that of the\niPad and iPad 2. Also it seems that the\niPad Mini will stick with the 16:9 ratio in-troducedwiththeiPhone5,whichmakes\nsense as most movies are \ufb01tted to this ra-tio. Furthermore the Mini will sport dual\nKindle Fire HD\nWe apologise to any Apple fanboys who just ejaculated in their lecture\nThe Kindle Fire HD has Dolby speakers, for book worms who like sound\nSurface - Microsoft products shouldn\u2019t look this good or colourful\nGoogle endorse Transformers?

Thus it will not\nbeasfastasitsnewestbigbrother,butthe\nCPU will clock in at a respectable 1GHz.\nUnfortunately it seems that the Mini will\nuse the 8-pin dock connector introduced\nwith the iPhone 5, so if you have tons of\n\u201cold-school\u201d accessories then perhaps\nyou should \ufb01nd something di\ufb00erent.\nLogic dictates that the software of\nthe iPad Mini will be iOS 6, however it\nseemslogicdoesnotdictateAppleMaps.\nYep sorry folks, you don\u2019t seem to get a\nchoice for the software if you want to\npurchase this pocket-sized Apple tablet.\nHowever, iOS 6 does have several posi-tives, which perhaps will make this buy\nsensible for you; \ufb01rst and foremost the\nApp Store. I cannot emphasize how big\nthe iOS App store is: it drives the whole\necosystem.Withmorethan500,000apps\nyou will never be left wanting in your\nsearch for the perfect app. The question\nis, with Apple\u2019s constant fragmentation\nof its devices, are they heading the way of\nAndroid? How many of these half a million apps will work out for the Mini? We\nwill have to wait and see! Another pro of\nthe iPad Mini exists in the co-ordination\nit shares with the other Apple devices, so\nif you are one of those people who owns\noneorseveralApplethings,thenperhaps\nthis is for you.\nNow to the price. If you\u2019re thinking, I\nwant it, how much do I have to spend?\nI\u2019ll tell you that the price bandied around\non the internet is quite intriguing! For\ndi\ufb00erent memory sizes (8GB, 16GB and\n32GB) the web states a price in the range\nof \u00a3180 to \u00a3250! That\u2019s right guys you\ncould own an iPad for less than 200 quid!\nNow, if you are already mentally running\ntotheApplestoreinRegentStreet,Ihave\none last caveat: the release date! Sadly, we\ndo not know the exact release date, as it\nseemsproductionproblemsarehaunting\nApple\u2019s production of the Mini, but with\na new Apple conference titled \u201cwe have a\nlittlemoretoshowyou\u201don23rdOctober,\nwe\u2019re pretty sure it\u2019s then.\n\n"

Turn to page 4 to see the full cover-age.\nNow for the yearly \u2018why is this?\u2019 ques-tion. The answer is probably the old cop\nout: it\u2019s not just one specific thing, it\u2019s\nmultiple factors all weighing in. I hate\nreading a sentence like that as it makes\nme feel like an arse for writing it, but I\u2019ll\nhave a go at dissecting it a bit.\nFirst of all, let\u2019s ask: are we really all\nunhappy? Or, alternatively, are we just\na lot more honest, frank, brutal, and, at\ntimes, bitter with our university experi-ence? Perhaps we all just love a good\nmoan, and other students are all about\nbigging up how great their university is?\nPerhaps I\u2019m going to ask another ques-tion? I probably will at some point, don\u2019t\nyou panic, you panicky reader you.\nHere\u2019s problem number one with the\nsurvey: it\u2019s subjective. That\u2019s true of\nall surveys, but when it can determine\nhow highly a university is regarded, and\npossibly what quality of students it can\nattract (i.e. top students, such as you\nreading this) the issue of subjectivity\nbecomes important. One student\u2019s idea\nof \u201cgood feedback\u201d is by no means the\nsame as another students. This is the\npoint of asking everyone: normalising\n(if that\u2019s the word?) the results a bit, so\nthat individual extremes don\u2019t bias them\ntoo much. However, that really doesn\u2019t\nalways work. If you have an entire body\nof students that have different expecta-tions, then of course they will skew the\nresults.\nIhonestlycan\u2019tsayforsurewhyweare\nunhappy, or even if we are. I know that\u2019s\nnot a bold statement, but it\u2019s a true one.\nHowever,I\u2019llgivemytwocents,andthey\nmay be wrong, but I\u2019ll speak my mind.\nI think that the workload hits us. Think\nabout it: if you\u2019re at XYZ wasteman university doing 1 hour of work a week and\nbeing told you\u2019re God\u2019s gift to your chosen discipline (i.e. getting a first), then\nwhen someone says \u201care you satisfied\nwith your course\u201d, the answer is bound\nto be an expletive filled proclamation of\nit being incredible.\nFeedback is where we really get\nkickedsquarelyinaplaceyoudon\u2019twant\nto get kicked. Why do we score so low\non this year after year? I think that there\nreally is one factor that is the primary\nreason: we expect a lot. This is actually a\ngood thing. We are at a good university,\nwhich always tells us that they are in the\nGolden Triangle and are battling it out\nwith Oxbridge for Galactic dominance or\nsomething. So, yeah, we should expect\na lot. If we didn\u2019t, we wouldn\u2019t exactly be\naiming for the stars like a daredevil with\na newspaper\u2019s name now would we?\nEnough pontification. Thinking is\ngood, but action is sometimes needed.\nIn my humble opinion, the best way to\nimprove feedback is standardisation. I\nhate bureaucracy as much as the next\nperson, but if you have a non restrict-ing, non time consuming method of\nfeedback, which sets a bare minimum\nthat the marker must do and say, you\nwill be on your way to a better system.\nFrom there onwards, you can drive up\nthe standards of feedback. Those going above and beyond are able to do so,\nand are not restricted. Those doing the\nbare minimum would at least be doing a\nlevel deemed to be good. This would, of\ncourse, have to be done in conjunction\nwith the PhDs, lecturers, and everyone\nelse marking the work. Then a system\nthat the undergraduates are happy\nwith, and that is not dumping absurd\namounts of work on the postgraduates\nwould be found. College should search\nfor this, as I\u2019m sure they can come up\nwith something if they put their head\u2019s\ntogether.\nOne last point to note is that this is not\na thorough dissection on my part. I wish\nI had more time to think about this, and\nmore space to write about it.

And, I completely\naccept, that, at the minute,\nthe changes will a\ufb00ect very\nfew people. Changing the Union\u2019s Constitution is important though\n\u2013 and, as well as explaining why I want\nto do it, I\u2019ll try and explain what needs\nchanging, a little briefer than the four\nthousand word \u2018guide to the twenty-thousand-word constitution\u2019 I\u2019m pro-posing.\nMost of the changes proposed focus\non how the Union operates structurally at the top: so few people will even\nrealise there\u2019s been a change, unless\nyou get disciplined, sit on the Union\nCouncil or are a sabbatical o\ufb03cer. So\nwhat\u2019s the point of changing it then if\nit won\u2019t a\ufb00ect anything practical?\nThe Union has to register as a Charity, following the Charities Act 2006\nwhich removes our exempt status. Not\nregistering, and losing our charity status would mean we have to pay corporation tax. Inevitably to cover the cost\nof running the Union if we had to pay\nout more (on taxes), we\u2019d have to \ufb01nd\nmore income, and the only place realistically to \ufb01nd more income would\nbe by rising bar prices. Remember\nthat the commercial income and the\nCollege subvention are the only two\nthings that make the Union money.\nEverything else costs: running the representation system costs; running a\nWelfare Advice service costs; subsidis-ing Clubs & Societies costs; cleaning\nand maintaining the buildings cost.\nWe have to make money somewhere.\nSo let\u2019s register and keep the amount\nof money we need to raise to keep operating at a minimum.\nRegistering as a Charity will mean\nthat our constitution is locked down\nconsiderably more tightly than it has\nbeen in previous years: we\u2019ll now need\nthe Charity Commission to approve\nany changes we make to our Constitution too, not just the College. So now \u2013\njust before we register \u2013 is the perfect\ntime to reform the governance of the\nUnion. Over the last few years, we\u2019ve\nall witnessed a failing of governance\nwithin the Union: substantial \ufb01nancial losses in both 2010 and 2011; the\nSummer Ball 2011 (I\u2019ll say no more);\ndelays to releasing elections results\ndue to bureaucracy \u2013 causing people\nto lose faith in the system. It needs re-form. Not only does it need reform \u2013\nit needs it now, so I can then concentrate on things that will have a more\ndirect e\ufb00ect on students throughout\nthe year, for instance writing more responses to government proposals to\nthe Higher Education sector that have\nbeen submitted already!\nTo allay fears that these proposals\nare going to be anything like those\nthat were suggested at the end of last\nyear, they\u2019re not. We\u2019re going to keep\nthe Deputy President (Finance & Services), and we\u2019re going to keep regular\nstudent involvement in the \u2018Executive\nCommittee\u2019 by scrapping proposals\nmade last year to have only sabbatical\no\ufb03cers on the committee.\nCurrently, there are three \u2018parts\u2019 to\nthe Union: what are described as an\n\u2018executive\u2019, a \u2018legislative\u2019 and a \u2018judiciary\u2019. These are three parts more commonly known as the Executive Committee, the Council and the Court.\nNo other Union in the country has a\n\u2018judiciary\u2019, and we simply aren\u2019t a big\nenough organisation to bother. More\nthan anything, the Court creates confusion and bureaucracy \u2013 something\nI\u2019m keen to avoid. They handle the\nserious complaints I can\u2019t, and sometimes they can be very serious. So\nserious that, in all other Unions, the\nPaul Beaumont\nFRIDAY 19 OCTOBER\n20\nI\nChanging the rules. Why\nbother?\nTrustee Board of the Union (the body\nthat is legally liable and can be sued)\nhandle them directly. This is so they\ncan take full control of a situation, and\ndecide the best route of action. By creating a sub-committee of the Trustee\nBoard (the \u2018Governance Committee\u2019)\nthat will concentrate on matters like\nthis, feeding back information to the\nwhole Board, there is no longer a need\nfor a \u2018Court\u2019. And the name annoys\nme: it\u2019s a bit up ourselves, no?\nHistorically, the Executive Committee used to be the de-facto Trustee Board. But, then in the 2007 governance review, the Board split into\nits own entity. Many of the powers\nyou\u2019d expect to be reserved for only\nthe most senior of committees (for\ninstance, the ability to sign o\ufb00 \u00a3500k\nof Union funds) were kept for the Executive Committee too though. This\nmakes it into a mini-trustee board,\nwith no legal accountability \u2013 and\nleaves the Trustees stricken with a potential \u00a3500k black-hole to \ufb01ll should\nsomething get authorised outside the\nbudget without them knowing. Ouch.\nThe Executive does serve some purpose though \u2013 which is why I\u2019m not\nproposing getting rid of it: instead I\u2019m\nproposing that it executes the policy\nset by Council in a more nitty-gritty\nway, and handles the more low level\nauthorisation of Club, Society & Project expenditure over \u00a350k (subject to\nthe funds being available!).\nMaking the Executive report to\nCouncil turns the most diverse and\ndemocratically elected body of the\nUnion into the most powerful one: the\nlargest body of students has the power\nto make policy, repeal it, debate and\ndiscuss all of the issues facing us as\nstudents \u2013 both within College and in\nthe wider world. Surely this is right?! I\nhave removed the speci\ufb01cs of what de\ufb01nes policy from the proposed constitution so that Council discussions can\nnow encompass what used to happen\nin Exec(utive) discussions.\nOne of the biggest shake-ups is\nsomething everyone should know\nabout, but pretty much will (hope-fully) be never useful. The plan is to\nput all of the Deputy Presidents onto\nthe Union\u2019s Trustee Board.

Sadly here we only\ndiscuss the Windows RT version, although there will be a Windows 8 pro\narticle later on, so don\u2019t worry!\nBefore we talk about the software,\nlet\u2019s talk hardware. The Surface has\nmany di\ufb00erences to the other low end\ntablets that make it quite attractive\nfor anyone looking at a purchasing a\ntablet. Not only does it have a beautiful 10.6 inch screen (something none\nof the other tablets discussed here\nhave), it also has the option to add a\nmicro SD card, and, perhaps the most\namazing, a USB port! The USB port\nmay not sound like such a big deal,\nbut when you think about all the tablets that have been released throughout these past few years, less than\nten have USB ports. This will allow\nexternal hard drives, computer mice\nand many other things to be attached\nto your tablet. Also the Surface has a\nvery good CPU (Tegra 3 (T30) that\nclocks in at a very fast 1.4GHz, which\nwill allow you to use your tablet without lag. One worrying thing about\nthe Surface though is the silence\nabout the battery performance that\nMicrosoft is practicing. Usually this\nis something that companies brag\nabout so perhaps this is may not be\nspectacular.\nWindows 8. What else can one say.\nWindows 8 is Microsoft\u2019s newest OS,\nand it has been praised as well as\ncriticized, so what will this operating system do for the Surface? I am\nquite excited actually, as it seems this\nwill be the \ufb01rst attempt at a tablet\nthat will give you a full desktop experience on a device you can hold in\none hand! However, since this is the\nbudget version, we can not expect\nthe whole shebang, but what is still\nachieved is really impressive. This\nincludes something that we expected\non tablets but never got, but that Microsoft has promised us, and this is\nthe \u201ctrue multitasking experience\u201d.\nOn the Surface, Microsoft claims\nthat you will be able to run two apps\nsimultaneously, next to each other,\nwhich adds to the ability of the surface to work like a desktop-on-the-go\nfor a student. When you purchase\nthe Surface with Windows RT, you\nget the Word, Excel, Powerpoint and\nOneNote thrown in, which for most\nstudents is a bonus! Two cons that\nI do have to mention, is, \ufb01rstly, the\napparent worries that many experts\nhave about Windows 8. So when you\nbuy the Surface, you will be buying\ninto something that is new and un-tested. Secondly, programs can only\nbe downloaded from the Windows\nstore (\u201cmetro style\u201d), but when you\nare used to tablets today, this sounds\nlike what we all know and love. The\nproblem with this, similarly to the\nKindle, is the limiting app store. The\nWindows Marketplace has only about\n100,000 apps. So what you ask? Well\nhow many are going to be optimised\nfor the Surface?\nThe Surface seems to be a great\ntablet, and it surely will make some\nkind of impact into the tablet market.\nHopefully we will be seeing cheaper\niterations of the Surface in the future,\nbut, honestly, for what you are getting\nit is a bit cheeky wanting it to be less\nthan 400 pounds.\nbuy before the Christmas rush: pre-order before Halloween!\n11\nFRIDAY 19 OCTOBER\nThe Summary*\n* for those too lazy to read the reviews\nWe have looked at 4 different tablets, from 4 different companies\nwith 4 (almost) different Operating systems. So now you are scratching your head and wondering, which one is for me? Well let\u2019s compare them and see which kind of person they fit. Before we make any\ncomparisons, we can safely ignore the hardware (unless its something\nradically different) because all of these are relatively the same, and\nthus software is the real variant.\niPad Mini\nWith Apple you always know what you get, you know that everything\nwill be high quality and will work. Nothing will feel cheap, and if you\nown other Apple products it is only a plus. If you are a person who is\nhappy to be confined within the eco-system of Apple and aren\u2019t really\nthat techie, this may be the tablet for you.\nPrice: \u00a3180 to \u00a3250\nRelease Date: 23th\nOctober (rumoured)\nMemory: 8GB to 32GB\nOS: iOS\nKindle Fire HD\nThe Fire HD is the one who doesn\u2019t seem to have a real target audi-ence, but when you really look at it has a lot to offer. The people who\nwill want to look into the Fire HD, are not really that focused on apps,\nbut more into the ebook/music scene. The speakers as well as the unlimited cloud storage seem promising. I, however, really like this free-ebok-if-you-are-an-amazon-premium-member thing, maybe you do\ntoo!\nPrice: \u00a3159 - \u00a3199\nRelease Date: 25th\nOctober\nMemory: 16GB and 32GB\nOS: Modified Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich)\nMicrosoft Surface RT\nThe Surface, if it comes out as described, will be a game-changer in the\ntablet business. The fact that you have a USB port, a touch keyboard\ncover, as well a kickstand for it to stand on its own, makes this tablet\npretty much a laptop (or \u201chybrid\u201d). This may be the best option for a\nstudent, considering you get most of Microsoft office as well as a 10.6\ninchw screen, but sadly the price may put some people off.\nPrice: \u00a3400\nRelease Date: 26th\nOctober\nMemory: 32GB and 64GB with options to add more\nOS: Windows RT\nGoogle Nexus 7\nGoogle\u2019s foray into the tablet market has been a successful one, and\nthis tablet is for those who are not happy to be limited. Android is\nthe Windows of the tablet world, and such modifiability will appeal to\nmany tech-oriented students. The inclusion of NFC will also appeal to\nthose who have a Android device with Android beam.\nPrice: \u00a3159 - \u00a3199\nRelease Date: Out Now\nMemory: 8GB and 16GB\nOS: Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean)\nMicrosoft Surface RT\nhe Nexus 7 was hoped to\nbe the Android answer\nto the iPad in the low-budget tablet market and\nfrom the reviews it really\ndoes seem that way. The tablet, made\nby Acer and Google, is the most successful Android to date (barring the\nKindle Fire if you count that as Android), so perhaps this is the one for\nyou!\nThe Nexus comes with an extremely\nsharp 7 inch screen, as well as good\nbattery life, wi\ufb01 and NFC technol-ogy. This allows you to use Android\nbeam with other Android devices\nwith NFC, which makes sharing \ufb01les\neven easier. Sadly the Nexus does\nnot come with a rear camera, which\nmeans if you want to take pictures\nwith your tablet (but honestly, who\nreally does?) you not only have to get\na camera app, you also have no option to see a preview of your picture.\nCompared to the other tablets looked\nat here, it\u2019s quite a bit heavier considering its size.\nThe hardware might not sound so\nawe-inspiring, but it\u2019s the software\nthat really does this trick for this tab-let. The Nexus is the \ufb02agship of the\nAndroid tablet world, and thus it has\nthe newest Android version (Jelly\nBean) and will most likely will be the\n\ufb01rst to get further updates. Furthermore, if you are someone who likes\nto get inside the guts of their pos-sessions, Android is the way to go, as\nit (along with other Nexus devices)\ncomes with a Boot Loader, which allows the user to get privileged control of the devices subsystems. Thus\nyou can modify how your Nexus 7\nwill work. This freedom is unique\nto the Android experience and a big\nselling point for people who want to\ncontrol their environment and not be\ncontrolled by it. Another positive of\nAndroid is the integration that it has\nwith your Google account and more\nimportantly with Google Maps, as the\nwhole Apple Maps \ufb01asco shows how\nimportant mapping really is to users.\nThis tablet is the only one out at\nthis very moment, and so you could\ngo and buy it right away. Maybe you\nwill when you hear the price: \u00a3159\n& \u00a3199 for the two variations. This\nis de\ufb01nitely an absolutely amazing\ndeal for what you get, and if you are\nan Android person you should really\nconsider this tablet for Christmas or\ngenerally to buy.\nGoogle Nexus 7\nW\nT\n\n"

With only\n3 returning members no one was quite\nsure how the team would perform under\nmatch pressure and there were a lot of\nnerves before the \ufb01rst whistle.\nThe match got o\ufb00 to a shaky start for\nboth teams with quite a lot of mistakes\nmade on each side, but slowly as the\nteams found their feet goals started to be\nscored. The \ufb01rst quarter was very close\nand ended 9-8 in IC\u2019s favour but the\nwhole team knew they should be win-ning, and winning by more.\nIn the second quarter the passing improved and with some great defence IC\nfound more of a rhythm through the\ncourt.SophieAndrewwasonforminter-cepting passes in the circle and Sam Killick was starting to control the play well\nfrom the centre.

Inevitably it was di\ufb03cult to\nconvince 7 players to come all the way\nto Essex, but with the help of 3 fresh-ers and Harriet Rumgay who had been\ndrafted up from the 4\u2019s we were able to\nset o\ufb00 with 8 players on board.\n3 hours later we arrived at Essex\nto play in the dark with a very good\nchance of rain, but this was not going\nto dishearten IC 2\u2019s as it was captain,\nAbi Johnston Hume\u2019s, 21st birthday\nand she still found the dedication to\ntake her team all the way to Essex.\nThe \ufb01rst quarter got o\ufb00 to a rocky\nstart, with a team who had never\nplayed together before. Essex looked\nlike they wanted every ball much\nmore than we did and slowly started\nto pull away. The quarter ended 7-3 to\nEssex. Still, even this wasn\u2019t enough\nto dampen IC\u2019s mood and with heads\nheld high we went out for the 2nd\nquarter ready to \ufb01ght.\nEssex had \ufb01rst centre after the\nbreak, but a fantastic interception by\nSarah Simmonds turned the ball over\nand went straight to a goal. IC then\ncapitalised on their centre and were\nready to take another goal from Essex.\nSome brilliant defending ensured that\nthis was the case and IC scored another turnover. Harriet and Izzy started to work really well together and\nbrought the aggression up enough just\nto stop Essex thinking they could push\naround. Harriet was then claimed by\nthe slippery corner, showing us just\nhow \ufb02exible she is by doing the splits.\nA commotion around the defending\n\u2018D\u2019 saw Toni Semmence knocked to\nthe \ufb02oor and her game ended due to\na recovering ankle injury. The quarter\n\ufb01nished 10-8 still in Essex\u2019s favour.\nThe second half saw Emily Rolfe\ncome on and make an immediate\nimpact with some fantastic intercep-tions. IC were looking con\ufb01dent and\nthe game was starting to look like\ntheirs. Some great defending from\nEmma Dixon and Rebecca Tyne ensured that every rebound and loose\nball was ours. The slippery corner\ndecided taking Harriet wasn\u2019t enough\nand Rebecca was soon on the \ufb02oor not\nonce, but twice. Great work around\nthe attacking \u2018D\u2019 by Abi Johnston\nHume and Sarah ensured that Izzy\nand Harriet could continue to score\ngoal after goal.

Essex took their game\nup a notch and really gave a hard \ufb01nal push. Some questionable umpiring decisions saw the ball being taken\naway from IC on a regular basis, but\nthis only spurred the girls on to work\nharder to ensure they secured the win.\nThe game ended 18-15 to IC: Happy\n21st birthday Abi!\nICUNC are undefeated so far this\nseason with the 1\u2019s, 2\u2019s and 3\u2019s all\nbringing home a win. This year\u2019s teams\nhave certainly gelled much better right\nfrom the o\ufb00. With some quality training sessions in store and the possibility\nof some coaching from some England\nnetball players, I de\ufb01nitely don\u2019t think\nit\u2019s too early for the promotion calls to\nbe thrown around.\nWith an impressive 3-1 pre-season\nvictory over RUMS 2nd XI last week, IC\n2s arrived at Harlington keen to keep up\nthe high standard of hockey and register\na win in our \ufb01rst competitive \ufb01xture of\nthe season. Having been defeated at the\nend of last season in a close-fought Varsity match, we were wary of the threat\nposed by the ICSM 2s.\nAfter a rather longer than expected\nwarm-up while we waited for the umpire to arrive, the match got underway\nwith both sides moving the ball around\nwell in mid\ufb01eld, though without posing\nmuch threat to either goal. As the half\nprogressed, IC began to impose themselves on the game and after a period of\npossession managed to make the break-through. A well worked long corner\nroutine delivered the ball to right back\nBM-Briggs on the 25-yard line, who\n\ufb01red in a trademark hit into the crowded penalty area. Several IC forwards attempted to de\ufb02ect the delivery into the\ngoal, however it was an ICSM defender\nwho managed to get the \ufb01nal touch and\nunfortunately put the ball into his own\nnet.\nIC continued to pile on the pressure\nthroughout the half but it was by no\nmeans a one-sided match, ICSM looking particularly dangerous down their\nright hand side with some excellent\nstick skills from their right-back who\nwas a constant threat overlapping down\nthe wing. However some solid defend-ing, particularly from 2nd XI debu-tant Lars Mejnertsen who (fractured\na thumb in the process) ensured that\nthe IC keeper remained untroubled.\nAs the second half drew to a close, the\nIC pressure began to tell with the game\nincreasingly played in the ICSM half. A\nseries of short-corners led to two solid\nsaves from the ICSM keeper denying\nthe IC drag-\ufb02icker CBE from a \ufb01rst goal\nof the season, but IC would not be kept\nout for long. CBE dummied a drag-\ufb02ick\nand slipped the ball left to Brickney\nwho struck a \ufb01rm shot past the helpless\nICSM keeper, courtesy of a slight de\ufb02ection o\ufb00 a defenders stick.\nIC were not as dominant as they had\nbeen against RUMS the week before,\nbut crucially managed to capitalise on\ngood possession and build up play to\n\ufb01nish the half 2-0 up. The second half\nstarted scrappily with IC perhaps a little\ncomplacent having ended the \ufb01rst half\nwith a comfortable lead. ICSM had their\n\ufb01rst truly dominant period of the game,\nonly some excellent last-ditch tackles\nfrom \u2018Fresher\u2019 Mikey in particular and\nsome poor \ufb01nishing on the part of the\nmedics kept the IC goal untouched. Despite the pressure it was IC who again\nmade the breakthrough, a well-worked\nshort corner led to a simple tap-in for\nFresher Mikey to make it 3-0 and soon\nafterwards the victory was con\ufb01rmed by\nanother goal from the very same man.\nThe ICSM keeper made an excellent\nsave but was helpless to prevent Fresher Mikey from scoring his third in two\ngames \u2013 not a bad return from a defensive mid\ufb01elder!\nICSM continued to press for a consolation goal, and it was only a magni\ufb01cent save from the IC goalkeeper diving\nhigh to his right hand side that denied\nan excellent drag \ufb02ick in the closing moments of the game. The \ufb01nal highlight\nof the game was an outrageous aerial\nfrom the IC left-back Meatspin, it was\ndi\ufb03cult to decide which more surpris-ing; the fact that he had tried to throw\nan aerial or that it had actually worked!\nEither way, his arrogance on top of another solid performance at the back was\nrewarded with a well-deserved Man-ofthe-Match award. The match \ufb01nished\n4-0 to IC and while the scoreline was\nnot an adequate representation of what\nwas actually a very closely fought match,\nIC will be delighted to have scored three\ngoals from short-corners as this was a\nparticular weakness last season. The\ne\ufb00ort and intensity of the whole team\nwas excellent throughout, and an ICSM\nteam that is always good going forwards\nwas countered with a very good press\nand good defensive work throughout\nthe team. IC will be hoping to build on\nthe unbeaten start to thie season and\nwith the introduction of several promising freshers into an already strong team,\nit looks to be an exciting year ahead for\nIC Hockey 2s!\nDebate raged about\nhow good this shot is\nBack row, 2nd from the\nright.

As the name sug-gests, they work by counteracting the effects\nof histamine. They do this by acting as antagonists on the H1 histamine receptor. Histamine is an inflammatory mediator released\nby mast cells in response to immunoglobulin\nE activation (caused\nby an allergen such\nas pollen). Its release\nin the nasal mucosa\ncauses inflammation,\nleading to the symptoms of hay fever: nasal congestion, runny\nnose, itchiness, and sneezing.\nThere are two broad classes of antihis-tamines: first generation and second gen-eration. First generation antihistamines are\n\u201csedating\u201d. They cause drowsiness because\nthey can cross the blood-brain barrier and\nact on the central nervous system as well as\nthe periphery. Examples of these include pro-methazine, chlorphenamine and clemastine.\nSecond generation antihistamines are larger\nand less lipophilic molecules. This means they\ncross the blood-brain barrier less readily, and\nare therefore less likely to cause drowsiness.\nFor this reason, they are usually recommended over the first generation drugs. Examples\nof second generation antihistamines include\ncetirizine, loratadine and fexofenadine.\nCorticosteroids\nCorticosteroids are a form of steroid treat-ment, and this come with the usual warnings that steroids usually have: mood swings,\nweight gain, and acne. However they have\nthe benefit of being an incredibly effective\nform of treatment. They also have the benefit\nof being a usable form of treatment for pregnant women, and those who do not respond\nto antihistamines.\nThere is also a difference\nin the method of administra-tion, with most corticosteroids being in the form of eye\ndrops or nasal sprays. This\nmakes them incredibly useful if a hay fever sufferer has\nsevere eye irritation, though\ntablets are also available. It\nis also possible to obtain antihistamines in eyedrop form.\nApproaches that involve training the immune system to prevent hay fever from manifesting are called immunotherapy, of which\nthere are two kinds.\nThe first of these is called SLIT, or sublingual immunotherapy, involves placing a pill\nunder the tongue, which dissolves. This pill\ncontains a small amount of pollen.\nA clinical trial, in association with Royal\nBrompton and Harefield NHS Trust, was\nconducted last year to investigate the long-term effectiveness of two much-praised pills,\nAlutard SQ and Grazax. This includes a campaign to attract volunteers, including the advert seen above in Felix last year.\nThis research was led by Professor Stephen Durham, from the faculty of Medicine\nat Imperial College London, who has large\namounts of experience in this field. The aim\nwas to find whether the pill form was as, or\nmore, effective than injections, which would\nremove the need for the inconvenient method of administration for people who use this\nform of treatment.\nThe second type is called SIT, or systemic\ninjection immunotherapy, where the pollen\nis injected into the skin.\nPollenLITE is an example of this kind. Such\nan approach is not new, with vaccines having\nexisted for a long time, however the difference between this and previous approaches\nis a less intrusive way of administration,\nthanks to the shallower injection needed.\nBoth kinds of immunotherapy require\nmultiple administrations to build up the\nnecessary level of immunity, with it possibly\nrequiring up to a year until the symptoms\nof hay fever are no longer felt. With this in\nmind, less intrusive methods are always\ndesired.\nr and the NHS)\nHigh pollen\ndays per\nregion\nBirch\nGrass\nNettle\n\n"

But this season, instead of taking a backstage\nrole upon which the other pieces found their roots, black\ntook a leap forward, hitting centre stage with a dark\nmythical beat \u2013 nothing boring or dull about it at all.\nMaking appearances across all the catwalks, the colour black found itself metamorphosing constantly \u2013 in\ntough patent leather at one show to sumptuous sweeping\nsheers the next. Velvet, silk, fur and tweed: the key with\nblack this season, as always, lies in the variation of texture\nand it is here that the most modern incarnations of black\nare to be found.\nInvest in classic pieces in black that will last a lifetime\n\u2013 a vintage designer coat, an evening dress, or a chic fur\nwrap for the winter chills. Black is back, for good.\nVictoria\nBeckham\nGucci\nMcQ\nYves\nSaint\nLaurent\nMoschino\nChristopher\nKane\nChristian\nDior\nStella\nMcCartney\nGucci\nJil\nSander\nViktor\n&\nRolf\nBottega\nVeneta\nFOREST\nCOBALT\nBLACK\nIt may be hard for us Londoners to imagine a more common colour other than grey given that it surrounds us as\nconcrete pavements and towering clouds, but we must\ntry to remember that for those not living in a metropolis\nthere is another form of life: nature. And it is from here\nthat the colour \u2018forest\u2019 emerges.\nWhy forest as opposed to green I hear you ask: because\nit is neither the grassy nor algae shades of nature to which\nwe refer. Rather, it is the deep tints of winding ivy and\nplush peacock hues that are to be envied.\nKeep in touch with nature, literally, with McQ\u2019s leaf-embellished military coats or look to Natasha Poly whose\niconic moment in Gucci\u2019s show-stopping velvet leopard-print Devore dress at Cannes sealed the colour into the\nfashion repertoire.\nSome may call it blue, but in the fashion world we prefer\ncobalt this winter. Not quite dark enough to call navy, cobalt strikes somewhere between royal and midnight.\nWith enough shine, the colour is electrifying as per\nMoschino\u2019s dress with its shimmy-worthy feathered skirt,\nyet when sheer layers are built up into intensity a la Christian Dior, cobalt transforms into an exquisite, yet understated incarnation of the colour.\nBut it was Stella McCartney\u2019s take on cobalt in neat\nsuits and perfect tailoring that really took the colour into\nthe collective fashion consciousness. Never before has\nbusinesswear looked so fresh and modern. Think back to\nthe reign of Thatcher, and take away the shoulder pads,\ndubious politics and big hair and add a heavy dose of chic.\nNow that\u2019s a conservative party I could go to.\nnot for shrinking\nf grey \u2013 whether\nartorial or literary\nbrave the cold in a\nour offered up on\nseason. From rich\np purple, there\u2019s a\nit all tastes.\nYang and\nVerhagen\nm vogue.co.uk\n15\nFRIDAY 19 OCTOBER\n\n"

    "content": "BOOKS\nBooks Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n23\nFRIDAY 19 OCTOBER\nGentlemen Bastards?\nMaciej Matuszewski talks about Scott Lynch\u2019s debut series\naving been turned\non to large scale\nheroic sword and\nsorcery fantasy by\nPatrick Rothfuss\u2019 excellent and much acclaimed Kingkiller\nChronicles I was very eager to read\nScott Lynch\u2019s similarly highly praised\nGentleman Bastard series (currently\nconsisting of The Lies of Locke Lamora\nand Red Seas Under Red Skies). Set\nin a fantasy world clearly inspired by\nrenaissance Italy, the books follow the\nGentlemen Bastards, a gang of thieves\nand con\ufb01dence tricksters led by the\ncharismatic Locke Lamora.\nThe Lies of Locke Lamora certainly\ndid meet my expectations. Very well\nwritten for a debut novel, it had interesting and likeable characters and\na fascinating setting in the city of\nCamorr, a Venice-like metropolis with\nscattered remnants of ancient buildings constructed of indestructible\nglass by a mysterious, long gone civili-zation. It dealt with complex and morally ambiguous themes of revenge.\nThe plot was interesting and well de-veloped, with several unexpected de-velopments. While not reaching the\ndepth and quality of Rothfuss\u2019 work it\nwas still a very good book.\nRed Seas Under Red Skies was more\ndisappointing. While still having several good moments \u2013 Lamora\u2019s heists\nare particularly interesting \u2013 the novel\nhas a fatal \ufb02aw with in its characters.\nWhile in the \ufb01rst book our heroes resorted to some pretty unsavoury tactics to survive and get back at the men\nwho killed some their friends here they\ncontinue behaving in the same way for\nseemingly no reason. Looking at the\nsituation objectively they are clearly\nthe villains of the story \u2013 their tactics\nare no better than that of their main\nopponent and their goals are far less\nnoble. There would be nothing wrong\nwith this if Lynch didn\u2019t persist in portraying Lamora and his accomplices as\nthe good guys. Instead of what could\nhave been a thoughtful exploration of\nthe consequences of the mistakes of\nthe main characters the way the story\nis framed constantly presents them as\nthe for the most part as innocent victims of circumstance.\nDespite this large annoyance, the\nbook remains very readable \u2013 I \ufb01nished it o\ufb00 in a single weekend. I\u2019ll certainly be buying the next novel when it\ncomes out \u2013 I hope that it will turn out\nthat the second novel is just a small\nblip in what is a very promising series.\nH\n\n"

We hadn\u2019t even left the Union\nbefore B-Eth-Eth (Milo McGrath)\nhad fallen victim to one of Asterix\u2019s\n(Charles Gassuer) concoctions. After\n\ufb01nishing in the Union we all come\nto the logical conclusion that it was\nmuch better to stay awake through\nthe night than let a hangover set in\u2026\nThe real \ufb01rst match of tour was\nplayed in London Victoria station\nbetween American Psycho (Ben Aldrich) and whoever else could be\narsed. It happened to be a real cagey\na\ufb00air, with neither team really looking to pounce on the opposition\u2019s\nmistakes. Strangers would occasionally have complete disregard for the\ngame and walk straight through it,\nbefore a member of the security team\npolitely asked us to stop, which we\nreluctantly did. With the energy of\namoebas we managed to make it into\nMunich. B-eth-eth threw up on the\n\ufb02ight, purely due to his chronic travel\nsickness and nothing to do with prior\nactivities.\nThe \ufb01rst day was spent in Munich\u2019s\npicturesque Englischer Garten and\nsome casual shirts vs skins action was\nplayed out here before we headed\nback to the hostel to begin the night\u2019s\nactivities. Tour matchbox began in\nthe hostel, this led to a casual descent\ninto mayhem when all deaths were\npunishable by beer bong.\nMunich has a smorgasbord of tour-isty things for IC football to wade\naround. The 1972 Olympic Park was\nthe \ufb01rst port of call on Sunday, and\nbeing of huge sentimental value the\nbeer bong had to come with. We\nmoved onto the BMW museum before deciding to sample Munich\u2019s real\nselling point \u2013 beer gardens. Having\ngrown bored of using it in the usual\nold 2 person fashion it was time for\nsome freestyle bonging, with the Usain Bong and the Culture Bong being\na few highlights. It should be noted at\nthis point that Fett-und-Kahl (Jonny\nHill) decided to disappear for 40\nminutes, managing to avoid beer and\nspend some quality time with solitaire on his phone.\nAt the hostel the triumphant\nthrashing of Italy by Spain in the Euro\n2012 \ufb01nal was viewed before the night\ndescended into chaos in Munich\u2019s\nKultfabrik region, a place that proclaims itself to be the \u2018biggest party\nzone in Europe\u2019. It soon became clear\nthough that this was a lie. Brown 0.5\n(James Brown) was particularly successful with a lady on this night as a\nresult of shouting \u201cFITTING HELL\u201d\nin the vague direction of large gangs\nof women, thus proving the theory\nthat if you throw enough shit at the\nwall some of it will stick. Fett-undKahl can verify Brown 0.5\u2019s romantic\nactivities.\nAfter taking a trip to the Allianz\nArena (the setting of Chelsea\u2019s heroics in the Champion\u2019s League just a\nfew weeks prior) we had our \ufb01rst of\ufb01cial game of football against FC EGarten. Finding the ground proved a\nreal challenge for the otherwise very\ncapable and well organised Twat-Sec\n(Giles Mann). The job was made all\nthe easier when the entire team, following behind him (Kony looking\nlike a \ufb01ctional character) resolved to\nshout continuously: \u201cGiles, where are\nwe going?\u201d\nLooking dishevelled Poppins tried\nto psych us up for the game with\na warm-up \ufb01t for a Royal Marine\nsquadron. Once we\u2019d satis\ufb01ed his appetite for craning, it was time to offer the lungs a little warm up too, and\nbefore long we felt ready to start the\ngame.\nWe passed scru\ufb03ly from the o\ufb00.\nThe selected starting eleven consisted of players from the 6\u2019s through to\nthe 1\u2019s and even a couple of Old boys.\nWith none of us having played properly since the season \ufb01nished last\nMarch, the team struggled to think\nthe same game and gel as a unit. A\nparticularly tired Dry Nights (Jack\nPeacock) was getting uncharacteristically ragged at left back and FC EGarten managed to \ufb01nd some space\nand capitalise when he was out of position for an earlier opener.\nCome half time E-Garten had managed to net again and some substitutions were needed. Among the squad\nof 20 there were 5 keepers and this\ndidn\u2019t exactly lend itself to making\ntextbook substitutions, although on\nthe whole the keepers turned out to\nbe a pleasant surprise: Framp-stains\n(Pete Frampton) creating space and\nmaking some good runs up front;\nGollum (Dave Docherty) keeping the\nball well in mid\ufb01eld. Letting the keepers union down was Twat-Sec who\nhad less than zero e\ufb00ect on the game.\nSadly the theme of shabby football\ncontinued throughout the game and a\nthird and fourth goal were soon con-ceded. After a shot from an E-Garten\nforward rebounded o\ufb00 the post it was\nclear that Kony (Bolly), having dived\nto his left to try and save the shot, was\nnot going to get up. Unfortunately, lying face down in the goalmouth was\nnot a strategy that stopped another EGartner tapping in the rebound.\nSmall consolation did come in the\n\ufb01nal minutes though when Fett und\nKahl played a delectable spread to\nGump (Chris Neilsen), who received,\nwent on a mazy run, beat multiple\nplayers and \ufb01nally put it on a plate for\nclub captain Fry-sexual (Tom Fryatt)\nto slot home. Despite the day\u2019s losses,\nthe last night in Munich descended\ninto havoc. Kony introduced some\nprimal box to the night\u2019s delights\nwith Dry Nights setting a new record\nfor how long it took him to get put\nto bed.\nThe \ufb01nal leg of tour was in Prague\n\u2013 a much more walkable city. On\nthe way, The Airborne Rangers entertained themselves for the 7 hour\ncoach journey with nothing but a microphone and their own wit.\nThe \ufb01rst night in Prague produced\nan event of epic proportion: the impromptu 3 hour IC football dance o\ufb00.\nDebate still rages on about which side\nactually won but in my opinion when\nit comes to dance-o\ufb00s it really is the\ntaking part that counts.\nUnfortunately, playing in the Great\nStrahov stadium (capacity 240,000 \u2013\nfraction full 0%) was not enough to\ninspire the tour team to victory the\nnext. Another disappointing performance led to a scoreline of 4-1, but\nnot without its own notable moments\u2026\nAfter being named \u2018super-sub\u2019 for\ncoming on at centre back and immediately conceding from a corner, Poppins (Tim Smithy Beasley) redeemed\nhimself by playing a delicious ball\nover the top for Framp-stains (Pete\nFrampton) to run onto and slot it in\nthe back of the net. By contrast, Fatthew (Matt Can) produced a piece of\nfootball which de\ufb01ed belief and won\nhim player of tour when he let the\nball through his legs, beat a man, then\nwent on a 40 yard run down the left\nwing. Having put so much e\ufb00ort in to\nthe prior 6 seconds he decided to end\nthe run by falling over.\nNights 5, 6 & 7 descended into an-archy, pandemonium and carnage re-spectively. Other highlights of Prague\nincluded topping the world charts at\nthe self-service pub, the goddess of\nthe cave, silentbox and hat-gate.\nThanks everyone for coming. A\nspecial thanks to Twat-Sec for organising everything, albeit at the last\nminute.\nICUAFC\u2019s Maraud into Europe\nSPORT\nSend your match reports in to sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nJack Peacock\nSports Writer\nLight blue is soo in this year.\nFootball and a beerbong?\nToo much lad for one\nphoto.\n\n"

    "content": "continued from the front page\nLocal residents opposed to tower height and traffic\nbeen entirely decided and con\ufb01rmed..\nIt seems, from the planning permis-sion, that it could house Biomedical\nresearch, health, and teaching facili-ties.\nThe plans, however, have met with\nstrong opposition from local resi-dents, with over one hundred letters\nobjecting to the proposals having\nbeen received by Hammersmith and\nFulham Council. Some half a dozen\ngroups, including the Hammersmith\nSociety and the Hammersmith and\nFulham Historic Buildings Group,\nhave voiced strong concern; with the\nSt Helens Residents Association creating a website \u2014 imperialfolly.org.\nuk \u2014 to articulate their concerns. In\nKensington and Chelsea, there were\n160 objections.\nMany of the objections concern\nthe relate to the height of Campus\u2019\nbuildings. While the highest BBC\nWorldwide Buildings on the site were\n4 stories tall Imperial College is not\nplanning on building any buildings\nwith less than \ufb01ve stories. The tallest\nbuilding will be a 35 story, 110m tall\nresidential tower which will, to Felix\u2019s\ncurrent knowledge, contain 133 units\nfor private sale and 59 apartments for\nImperial postdoctoral researchers.\nResidents fear that this will impact\nnegatively on low rise housing in the\nOxford Gardens Conservation Area.\nThe College dismissed concerns that\novershadowing by the buildings will\nlead to an excessive lack of sunlight for\nexisting houses, saying that the worst\na\ufb00ected buildings will be commercial\nproperties, and that the College used\nthe \u201cindustry leader\u201d to consult on the\ndaylight and overshadowing of build-ings.\nThere are also concerns about increased tra\ufb03c, especially in light of\nseparate plans to extend the nearby\nWest\ufb01eld shopping centre. The St\nHelens Residents Association believes\nthat \u201cit is hard to see how Wood Lane,\nwhich will provide the access and\negress for [both] developments, will\nnot be gridlocked at all times\u201d. They\nbelieve the problem will be exacerbated by the number of parking spaces\non the site, 240, being far too low to\nmeet demand.\nDespite the opposition it looks unlikely that the College will alter its\nplans. Imperial claims that the development will bring numerous bene\ufb01ts\nfor the local population, pointing out\nthat development plans include the\nbuilding of a new healthcare centre\nand a publicly accessible square. In a\nstatement earlier this year John Anderson, Project Director for Imperial\nWest, added: \u201cImperial West will provide real and lasting bene\ufb01ts for the\ncapital, helping to grow the London\neconomy, and has the capacity to generate and sustain over 3,000 jobs. We\nhave consulted widely with the planning authorities and local residents\nand this process has helped inform\nthe basis of our planning application.\u201d\nFelix contacted College to ask about\nmore recent developments. Speci\ufb01cally, Felix asked about how the College is working with the residents in\nthe local area to ensure that the residents are not left unhappy about the\ndevelopment. A College spokesperson replied with the following state-ment:\n\u201cIn developing the masterplan proposals for the former BBC site, the\nproject team has incorporated feedback from a variety of stakeholders\nincluding Hammersmith and Fulham\nCouncil, the Greater London Authority, and local residents. Among the\nre\ufb01nements made to the proposals\nbefore submission to the planning authority included:\n\u2022 Introducing a stepped building form on Wood Lane to take\non board concerns of residents\nliving nearby.\n\u2022 Reductions in the height and\nmassing of buildings along the\neastern boundary facing the\nresidential area of North Kensington.\n\u2022 Locating taller buildings further to the west and south of\nthe site, and re\ufb01ning the tallest\nbuilding in an east/west orientation to make it more slen-der, minimising its pro\ufb01le and\ntapering in relation to north/\nsouth views.\nLocal residents have been actively\ninvolved in the development of the\ncommunity space, \u2018Brick\ufb01elds Hall\u2019\non the junction of Shin\ufb01eld Street and\nEynham Road, working with the design team on the layout, \ufb01xtures and\n\ufb01ttings.

Well, actually, most of\nthe good ones opened (and closed)\nseveral weeks ago \u2013 anyone with\nsense will have applied ages ago,\nand those that haven\u2019t are probably\nfucked by now anyway, so might\nactually learn something useful\nfrom this helpful little guide.\nApplication forms\nIt\u2019s 6 pm, university is over, it\u2019s\njust you, your desk and your lap-top. And YouPorn. But whoa\nthere, don\u2019t spank the monkey\njust yet, because there\u2019s applying\nto be done. The initial application\nis pretty straight forward: since\nyou\u2019re at a \u201ctarget\u201d university, all\nyou really have to do is spell your\nname right, and you\u2019ll probably get\nswept into the next round of ap-plications.

Throw them \u00a35 and a\ncalculator, run o\ufb00 to the library toilet to bash one out. It\u2019s unlikely that\nyou\u2019ll make it as far as an assessment centre, and even less likely\nthat they\u2019ll bother to re-test you if\nyou make it there. No wonder the\neconomy is in fucking tatters.\nInterviews\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far then I can\nno longer guide you. In this world\nit\u2019s all about who you know. Or\nblow. I managed to blow my way\ninto a job without an interview.\nUnless you fancy genital breath for\nan inde\ufb01nite period I suggest you\njust get good at feigning competen-cies. Assessment centres are pretty\nstraight forward, usually consisting\nof a group exercise, case study and\ninterview. For the group exercise,\nyou\u2019ll likely run into Hugo, head\nof the investment society, sporting\nhis dad\u2019s suit and a smug grin that\nscreams \u2018massive twat\u2019. He\u2019ll be nice\nin the foyer, but once in the arena\nhe\u2019ll morph into Megacunt, spouting acronyms that contribute nothing of worth, doing anything in his\npower to make you look like a right\nnob.

Look out for a full\nreview in next weeks edition of Felix. Now - 10 November 2012.\nA squirrel looses his nut\nClassically, bronze is thought of as the\nmaterial of antiquity. The discovery\nof the endurable properties of such\ncopper alloys certainly allowed our\nancestors to make more robust tools\nand weapons than their stone-age pre-decessors. Its use as an artistic medi-um, however, from the ancient world\nto the modern day, cannot be over-looked. The impressive exhibition of\nBronze, currently running at the Royal\nAcademy, eulogises the versatility and\nbeauty of this abiding material, with\na collection of artworks and artefacts\nspanning over 5,000 years of history.\nAs the arduous process of casting\nwas perfected by the Greeks, it is only\njust that the exhibit opens with the\nDancing Satyr. Despite displaying the\nAncient Greeks\u2019 obsession with the\nmuscle architecture of the male form,\nthis stunning statue is far from the\ngeneric images of Grecian Gods and\nHeroes, wrestling with foul beasts,\nwhich we are so used to. Instead it\ndepicts a satyr vigorously throwing\nhimself into a dance. At \ufb01rst it may\nappear to be a human \ufb01gure, howev-er, while encircling and studying the\nform, his satyr features become visi-ble; pointed ears, wild expression and\nthe hole from which his tail would\nhave once protruded. The metallic\ngreen colouring, due to a high copper\ncontent in the bronze, gives the \ufb01gure\nan earthly glow and his fragmented\nlimbs add to the mysterious quality\nof the piece. I \ufb01nd it very \ufb01tting that\nhe was discovered by \ufb01shermen o\ufb00\nthe coast of Sicily. Researchers have\ndated this statue to the Mid-Late 4th\nCentury BCE and believe that he was\noriginally one member of a whole\nthrong of dancing satyrs. As this solitary \ufb01gure has been tantalisingly positioned in the centre of an otherwise\nempty room, the viewer is provided\nwith the physical space to imagine\nthe rest of his party, dancing around\nin the twilight.\nDexterously, this vast collection has\nbeen organised thematically, rather\nthan periodically, making it an absolute feast for the eyes. Where else\nwould you see a medieval Sanctuary\nRing door knocker from Durham\nCathedral alongside a bronze Basketball by Je\ufb00 Koons? Or how about exquisitely decorated vessels from the\nShang dynasty next to Jasper Johns\u2019\n1960 Painted Bronze (Ale Cans)? The\nscope the curators have given for the\ncomparison of these objects allows us\nto gain an appreciation for the adaptability and the fathomless importance of bronze throughout the ages.\nThe endurance, hue and \ufb01nish of\nbronze have proved it to be an ideal\nmaterial for creating giant, imposing statues of Gods and Heroes. I feel\nmyself cower beneath the colossal \ufb01gure of Perseus, as he stands over the\nwrithing body of Medusa and holds\naloft her severed head. This sculpture\nis the 1844 cast of Benvenuto Cellini\u2019s\nmasterpiece from the 1550s, ordered\nby the Second Duke of Sutherland,\nrepresenting within the collection\nthe long-established obsession that\nthe British have with the Florentine\nHigh Renaissance.\nBronze animals are also profoundly\ndelineated in this exhibition, most\nnotably by the intimidating Etruscan beast, the Chimaera of Arezzo.\nI am overwhelmed by the sheer skill\nit would have required to create such\na ridiculous looking creature; a \ufb01rebreathing lion, with an extra goat\nhead on its back and a snake for a tail.\nOther fabulous animals on display include The Porcellino, a life-sized boar\nby Pietro Tacca\u2019s, Louise Bourgeois\u2019s\n1996 Spider IV and Picasso\u2019s car-faced Baboon and Young. Juxtaposed\nagainst these comparatively modern\npieces, is the exquisite Danish Nordic\nBronze Age statue the Trundholm\nChariot of the Sun. According to\nthe Norsemen, everyday S\u00f3l, the sun\ngoddess, with her horses Arvak and\nAlsvid, carried the sun across the sky\non a chariot. It is, therefore, highly\npossible that this sculpture once had\na rider. It is very sophisticated, especially for such an early piece (dated\nto 14th Century BCE) and the embossed gold leaf on the sun is simply\ngorgeous. This, along with Alfred\nGilbert\u2019s St. Elizabeth of Hungary;\ndepicted with a forlorn, ivory face\namongst cascades of bronze roses\nand \ufb01nery, are my two favourite objects within this extensive collection.\nThey demonstrate how bronze can\nbe manipulated into \ufb01ner and more\ndelicate objects, rather than just gi-ant, majestic characters of grandeur.\nBronze will run at the Royal Academy until 6th December. It is de\ufb01nitely\nworth visiting; many of the artifacts\non display have never before been\nexhibited in England, and possibly\nnever will be again.\nBronze at the RA, until 9 December.\nTickets from \u00a39 for students.\nJemma Pilcher\nGold for Bronze\nThe Royal Academy succeeds with an exhibition on bronze sculpture throughout history\nHard body; bad skin\nThe spirit of Egypt is subtly evoked in the ENO production of Handel\u2019s longest\nopera, Julius Caesar. It tells the story of the conquering Caesar and the passions\nexposed and aroused by his arrival. Grief, anguish, desire, cruelty and joy are all\ndistinctly explored by the music. Each aria develops one particular emotion, the\nturmoil in a character taken to its limit. At the end of each of these, one feels as\nthough one had been taken by the hand and led to empathise with this emotion.\nI had never before seen a Handel opera; the music was completely unknown to\nme, as was the progression of the drama. Being this unknowledgeable is of course,\nboth a blessing and a curse. I can only write about such, rather useless and silly,\nthings as the feeling of elatement that took hold of me for the duration of the mu-sic. I can say something perhaps, on the richness of the voices of the three countertenors (these roles were originally sung by Castratti) or that I loved the way the\nend of each aria was disguised by a couple of \u2018false endings\u2019.Clearly, I cannot write\nwith any amount of confidence on the musical success of the production.\nHowever, unprejudiced and unbiased with respect to the production, I thought\nit to be a great success. I found the set design to have a great deal of elegance, giving the audience member a whiff of Egypt whilst allowing them to perhaps see the\nindividual emotions of the arias as a separate entity to the general drama. Not that\nthe production was low on drama. The highly stylised violence \u2013 think buckets of\nblood poured over white shirts in death scenes \u2013 went very well with the simplicity with which the plot progressed. Finally, there was the dancing, which has been\ncriticised for drawing attention away from the singers. But the choreography,\nwhilst nothing ground breaking, was simple and musical. The dancers and their\nshadows on the walls were reminiscent of Egyptian gods, a world at a distance\nfrom the singers, but aiding them in their adventures.\nThere are a few performances left, and since the theatre was relatively empty, it\nwill be very easy to get cheap tickets.\nIn brief: Julius Caesar at ENO\nEva Rosenthal Arts Editor\nWriter\n\n"

This was never\ngoing to be an easy conference for the\nConservatives.\nOf course this conference was by no\nmeansallnegativefortheConservative\nparty, despite the di\ufb03culties faced\nin the rest of the political sphere \u2013\nCameron is still the most liked of the\nthree main party leaders. The polls\nmust look distressing, but mid-term\nof a government during a recession to\nbe only 10 points behind is something\nto be not particularly worried about,\nespecially as Labour\u2019s lead is mostly\ncaused by not being in the coalition\nrather than through o\ufb00ering a\npreferable alternative.\nThe Tuesday of conference brought\nCameron to the podium. Calling for\nKirstin Hay\nPOLITICS\nFRIDAY 19 OCTOBER\n12\nPolitics Editors: Padraic Calpin\nMarie-Laure Hicks\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nParty conference \u2013 the political\nequivalent of the o\ufb03ce Christmas\nparty. Careers are made or broken;\ntoo much alcohol and inappropriate\nsex; and all the dirty secrets get out.\nThankfully much of that goes on\nbehind the scenes, because the novelty\nof catching politicians with their\ntrousers round their ankles would\nwear o\ufb00 pretty soon.\nThe media love to paint the\nparty conferences as a \u201cmake or\nbreak\u201d moment for the leaders of\nparties, but this time they really\nexcelled themselves. Not only is the\neconomy still not growing, and with\nunemployment especially among\nyoung people a continuing problem,\nCameron\u2019s party are going all out to\nmake the headlines and not necessarily\nin the best way. The party\u2019s Chief\nWhip, Andrew \u201cBruiser\u201d Mitchell,\nwas facing increasing pressure to\nresign after shouting obscenities\nat Downing Street police o\ufb03cers.\nJeremy Hunt, Health Secretary is\non issues they\u2019re uncomfortable seeing\npushed, such as Zac Goldsmith on\nHeathrow\u2019s Third Runway, or Nadine\nDorries on everything. You can see the\npush from all main parties to legalise\nsame-sex marriage is angering the\ntraditional Tory base. Lord Carey even\nmanaged to compare those calling\nopponents of equal marriage \u2018bigots\u2019\nto Nazis. As Theresa May might have\nsaid, \u201cWe\u2019re the Nasty Party\u201d, but one\nof the major changes in the party\nthrough Cameron\u2019s leadership\nwas the shift towards more\nliberal social policy, and the key\ntest to stand by this in tough\ntimes has been passed\nwith almost \ufb02ying\ncolours. Fringe\np o l i t i c i a n s\nmaking\nill-advised\ncomments at\nhomophobic\nr a l l i e s\na s i d e ,\nthe bulk\nof the\np ar ty\nremained in line during the\nconference, especially on the issue of\nsame-sex marriage.\nThose angered by the arrival of\npolicies such as equal marriage will\nhowever have been well appeased\nby the touting of the Government\u2019s\nlatest policy \u2013 \u2018Bash a Burglar\u2019. To\nsteal a line from Tony Blair, \u201cTough\non crime, tough on the causes of\ncrime\u201d, although I do not think that he\nhad more rights for homeowners to\nattack those breaking into property in\nmind. Many backbench Tory MPs are\nunhappy with laws such as the Human\nRights Act, so making a play to reduce\nthe rights of criminals will do much to\nkeep the Conservative party united,\neven when the Chief Whip is poised\non the edge of resignation.\nWith the conference season rounded\nup, not much has changed. The\ncoalition is still intact, Labour are still\nahead in the polls, and the economy is\nstill the biggest problem. The troops\nare rallied and each party is \ufb01red up\nto take the \ufb01ght to the others, it is just\na pity the next general election is not\nuntil 2015.\nConservative Party Conference\nThe Republicans\u2019 Last Chance to Win?\nhroughout the campaign,\nObama has been depicted\nas having two advantages:\nthe incumbent advantage\nand the demographic advantage.\nSince 1948, only three incumbent\npresidents have failed to be re-elected,\nwith seven successful bids. As an\nincumbent, the candidate has already\ngone through the necessary amount\nof selection to become president in\nthe \ufb01rst place and has four years\u2019\nexperience doing the job. At the\nmoment, with a dismal economy\nand gridlocked administration\nfollowing the GOP takeover of the\nHouse of Representatives, many\nvoters are disillusioned and even\ndisappointed with Obama,\nreducing the momentum that\ncarried him to victory in 2008.\nThe demographic advantage,\nhowever, is most certainly\nplaying its part in securing\nelectoral votes.\nThe American electorate\nis changing, at an increasing\npace. The white proportion\nof the electorate has been\ndeclining since\n1992. This\nyear, more\nthan\nhalf the babies born in the country\nwere from minority parents, especially\nLatinos. Every month, nearly 50 000\nLatinos become eligible to vote. And\nthey tend to vote Democrat. Polls\nhave shown that a resounding 65-72%\nof Latinos support Obama, with only\n20\u201325% supporting Romney.\nThis change in demographics\nhas sent states swinging. Florida,\nColorado and Nevada have become\nbattlegrounds. New Mexico, where\nalmost half the population is Latino,\nused to be viewed as a swing state\nbut since 2008 is almost considered\nas a safe state for Democrats. And\nthis is only the beginning. Texas, and\nits 38 electoral votes, has a growing\nLatino population. The Republican\nstronghold is now\nbeing eyed by\nDemocrats.\nThe strong\nlead Obama\nholds within\nthe Latino\ncommunity\nis rather\nastonishing.\nThey are one\nof the worst hit\ngroups by the\neconomic crisis\nand Obama\u2019s\nadministration\nr e a c h e d\nrecord numbers of deportations.\nHigher unemployment than the\nnational average and the house price\ncrash, it is no surprise that the Latino\nelectorate is focused on economic\npolicies for this election. Even after\na rise in support in 2010 and Senator\nMarco Rubio\u2019s stardom, Romney and\nthe GOP have failed to take advantage\nof the situation. The Republicans have\na strong and negative rhetoric on\nborder control and illegal immigrants\nthat alienates Latino voters. Romney\u2019s\npolicies on a double layer border\nfence with Mexico, \u201cself deportation\u201d\nand an electronic system to verify\nthe legality of workers is not helping.\nLatinos are not necessarily directly\nconcerned by these matters, however\nthey feel targeted. When Obama\ndeclared in June that he would not\ndeport undocumented immigrants\nwho arrived in America as children\nfor two years, the deal was sealed.\nThe Republican Party is risking the\ncreation of an unfriendly political\nidentity within the Latino community.\nThe GOP\u2019s second problem is the\nyouth. More than a third of GOP\nvoters are over 58. An Azimuth\nResearch Group poll has shown\nthat Republican voters aged 18-27\nhave di\ufb00erent priorities than older\nmembers. Half of young voters ranked\ngovernment spending as their main\ninterest, compared to 36% older\nvoters. Unemployment and individual\nliberty have similar scores for both\ngroups. The main other di\ufb00erence was\nthat younger voters showed little or\nno interest in family, immigration and\nthe right to life. The Republican Party\nmay be out of touch with Latinos on\nquestions like immigration, they are\nalso out of touch with most Millenials,\nthe most liberal generation. GOP\nmembership is expected to decline\ndrastically over the next 20 years, with\na third of its members e\ufb00ectively just\ndying away. The GOP is on the brink\nof a major demographic crisis. Its core\nvoter base, white, blue collar men,\nwill no longer be su\ufb03cient to win an\nelection. After 2012, the Republicans\nwill have to adapt their policies to\nthe new majorities and younger\ngeneration, without whom they risk\npolitical extinction. The Democrats\nalso need to provide more social and\neconomic opportunities for Latinos in\norder to keep their support.\nConcerning this coming election,\nthe die are still rolling. Romney\nhas the bad economy on his side.\nObama, even though he is backed by\nan astounding majority of Latinos, is\nplaying a dangerous game, as their\nvoter turnout is not always high. And\ncompletely random factors can still\na\ufb00ect the race. A local college football\nwin could boost the incumbent\u2019s\nsupport by an average 1.6%.\nMarie-Laure Hicks Politics Editor\nBoJo and his mate, Dave the Broom\nAmericans are electing their president\nbutalso33Senators,athirdoftheSenate\nand to an extent the keys to power.\nThe Senate has a strong role in the\nAmerican law making process. For an\nact of Congress to pass, both the Senate\nand the House of Representatives have\nto approve it. Effectively, whichever\nparty controls the Senate will have a\nstrong hand in the policies that the\nfederal government attempts to launch.\nThe battle for the Senate has become\nunexpectedly fierce and close, with\nbothpartiesnowfightingforeveryseat.\nRepublicans were expected to do well\nbut most recent polls (realclearpolitics.\ncom)puttheDemocratsintheleadwith\n48 seats, the GOP behind with 45 and\n7 toss ups.

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 19 OCTOBER\n28\nFrieze Art Fair 10\nThe best that can be said about most of the contents at Frieze is that is in some\nway decorative but there was much this did not possess even this lowly merit.\nRoss Knight\u2019s Form of Togetherness (right) is the worst form of meaningless,\nugly rubbish. The sculpture, made from patinated steel, iron, foam, twine, silicon\nand a massage tool stands as a testament the all that is bloated, ignorant and\nobfuscated in contemporary art.\nI understand the place for conceptual art, taking seeming innocuous objects\nand placing them together in some way that they acquire meaning. What I do\nnot understand is deliberately obscure, pretentious collections of literal crap.\nThe problem with much of the work that galleries had chosen to bring to the\n\ufb01ar was intended to be either pleasantly decorative or \ufb01t in with the zeitgeist. In\nother words, because everyone else was jumping on the bandwagon of a certain\nartist of approach, they were going to as well, regardless of actual merit. There\nwas very little that showed and bravery of vision. Anything that was is lost in a\nsea of blandness.\nThis is hardly a surprise. Art is big business and London is currently vying\nwith New York to be the art capital of the world. Frieze is the battle\ufb01eld and art\nis the victim.\nI was nonplussed by a yellow cube-with a barbecue on top and barbecue\nutensils hanging from the sides (see\nleft). Completely, utterly, confused. I\nsuppose that it is completely valid for\na work of art to produce confusion as\nan emotion in the unsuspecting view-er. Nevertheless, combined with the\ncynicism I was already experiencing\nafter a couple of hours of wandering\naround what must surely be one of the\nmost clinical, soulless markets in the\nworld, confusion led to a mere dis-taste. What was I looking at? Yellow\nis, coincidentally, one of my favourite\ncolours. The cube was done in quite\na warm, pleasant yellow, reminiscent\nof sunlight through some trippy sunglasses of mine. Was it representative\nof sunlight? Of blazing coals? Of the\ngolden luck that those people able\nto own a barbecue experience? This\ntrain of thought took me to suburbia,\nAmerica and the dads who love to\ngrill surf n\u2019 turf on Sunday evenings.\nWas the piece a representation of the\nbanality, the platitudes, of this style of\nlife? Of it slowly but surely turning into embers? Perhaps. But\nI\u2019m grasping at loose ends\nhere. In the end, it was\njust a barbecue mounted on yellow block.\nWe hated...\nFrieze Art Fair, for those of you who have missed the press coverage, is big. It attracts over 60,000 visitors a year and generates enough acres of print to cover the\nenormous canopy in Regents Park housing the whole circus. Tickets sell out well in\nadvance of the fair, which only lasts a few days. Every year the show kicks off hackneyed argument about the value of contemporary art and profiteering in the art\nworld in general. This is the tenth London fair and nothing has changed.\nJust so you get an idea of scale, 175 galleries attend the fair, with some big names\nthat you will recognise, like White Cube, next to smaller galleries from across the\nglobe. This year for the first time there were actually two fairs, with a second one\ndedicated to selling older artwork. While sales figure have not been released for six\nyears, the last published value was \u00a326 million. This is likely to be a huge underestimate of the revenue that will be generated in the coming weeks. Guesses for the\ntotal value of the art have been quoted at one and a half billion.\nThere are a few really big names; the Gagosian Gallery boasted artworks from\nDamian Hirst, Andy Warhol, Glen Brown, Jeff Koons. Most of the work however\nis from smaller galleries with artists you probably will not have heard of. The rich\nand famous weave their way through the crowds, their advisors struggling to stay\nin their way. Astronomical quantities of money are talked abut as though they were\nsmall change.\nFrieze is a temple to commercial art. It is very difficult to block out the distractions\nand focus on the perennial questions. What on earth are you looking at? Is it really\nworth that much and you about to walk past something that will be hanging on the\nwalls of the Tate and 30 years time.\nEva Rosenthal & Meredith Thomas pontificate on Frieze\nWTF is Frieze?\nHipsters deported in\nsea container\n\n"

    "content": "The modern vamp tragedy\nLucia Podhorska sinks her teeth into The Vampire Diaries\naving already reviewed True Blood\nand Bu\ufb00y, it was\nonly a matter of time\nbefore I shared with\nyou my thoughts on the current\nnumber one (according to some)\nvampire show on TV.\nAs with True Blood, The Vampire Diaries is based on a series\nof books. Written by L.J. Smith,\nthe book series of the same name\nfocuses on the character of orphaned Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev) from the \ufb01ctional town of\nMystic Falls, who falls in love with\nthe vampire Stefan Salvatore (Paul\nWesley). To make things slightly\nmore complicated, Stefan\u2019s older\nbrother Damon (Ian Somerhalder)\nis also a vampire with his heart set\non wreaking havoc in the small\ntown and generally making Stefan\nand Elena\u2019s lives miserable. It\u2019s not\ntoo long, however, before we see\nhis softer side and \u2013 unsurpris-ingly \u2013 a love triangle forms. As\nthe show progresses, Mystic Falls\nalso becomes host to other creepy\ncrawlies, ranging from witches to\nwerewolves and ghosts.\nI was initially sceptical about TVD,\nsimply because I\u2019ve put BTVS on a\npedestal and don\u2019t think anything\nin the same category can ever be\nas good. That being said, I almost\nalways get drawn into new vampire shows\u2026In the case of TVD, it\nwas Ian Somerhalder (who I loved\non LOST) who tempted me. And\nit is mostly Ian Somerhalder who\nhas kept me coming back.\nAt the beginning of the series, the\nmajority of the characters come\no\ufb00 as being typical vapid American teenagers and it takes a long\ntime for some of them to develop.\nWith the exception of Meredith\nGrey on Grey\u2019s Anatomy, for me\nElena is the most annoying main\ncharacter in any of the shows I am\ncurrently watching. I understand\nthat it must be horribly di\ufb03cult\nbeing loved by two gorgeous undead men, but honestly, woman,\nhave some self-respect and stop\nacting like your whole life is one\nbig sacri\ufb01ce. Thank God for Damon\u2019s eyes, otherwise I would\nhave long since tuned out. Why\nElena doesn\u2019t come to her senses\nand chooses Damon over Stefan is\nbeyond me \u2013 the tortured vampire\nact is getting kind of old and isn\u2019t\nparticularly attractive.\nIn terms of storyline, the makers\nof the show rely overly on over-dramatization and teenage angst.\nMaybe my age is simply starting to\nshow or perhaps I am too cynical,\nbut there isn\u2019t much in the show\nthat I can relate to. While themes\nof love, hate, loss and revenge (to\nname but a few) are all tackled,\nthey don\u2019t really resonate and there\nis no clear moral message behind\nthe stories. The constant negotiations and re-negotiations between\nthe good guys and the bad vampires is also something that is beginning to get on my nerves. With\nso many threats \ufb02ying around but\nnext to zero follow-through, the\notherwise delightful character of\nKlaus lacks credibility and comes\no\ufb00 more like a neutered puppy\nthan the scariest vampire of all\ntime.\nBecause of the general popularity of vampires as supernatural\ncreatures, as well as the fascination with human/vampire rela-tionships, there is a vast amount\nof \ufb01lms and literature devoted to\nthe subject. It\u2019s therefore becoming increasingly di\ufb03cult to \ufb01nd a\nshow that brings something new\nto the genre. It seems that the only\nthing that\u2019s being done is to change\nthe mythology of vampires \u2013 speci\ufb01cally their reaction to the sun\nand whether or not it kills them.\nAs a fan of the supernatural, this\nreally frustrates me, as authors\nkeep coming up with new ways of\nhaving vampires walk in the sun\nand their status of \u2018creature of the\nnight\u2019 is slowly but surely being\ntaken away, leaving behind creatures that aren\u2019t nearly as scary or\ntragic as they should be.\nI really do have a love/hate relationship with TVD. On the one\nhand, as is clear from this review,\nthere are many things I don\u2019t like\nabout it. On the other hand, it is\nthe kind of show that, once you\nstart, you do want to continue\nwatching it. The \ufb01rst episode of\nseason 4 aired last week and once\nthings settle down a bit, I know it\nwill be on my list of series I need to\ncatch up on.\nH\nThe Bold and the Beautiful...\nrevamped\nTELEVISION Television Editor: Lucia Podhorska\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 19 OCTOBER\n38\n\n"

    "content": "OMG WTF FTL FTW\nWhen I first met the new Games\nEditor we both agreed that Felix\nneeded reviews of proper mainstream games. Indie games are great\nfun and it\u2019s fantastic how the games\nindustry is moving in this direction.\nHowever, those triple-A \u00a340 games\nare the bread and butter of most\npeople\u2019s collections and what most\npeople end up playing. But then I\nplayed FTL and decided to disregard\nthat entire conversation.\nFTL: Faster Than Light is about as\nindie as it gets: made by a handful\nof people and funded through the\ncurrently very popular Kickstarter\nservice. This game offers the closest\nexperience you\u2019ll ever get to starring\nin your very own sci-fi, space-far-ing movie. If you\u2019re as nerdy as me\n(and this is Imperial so I reckon the\npeople less nerdy than me are in a\nminority) then you\u2019ll love it. On the\ngame\u2019s website this game is defined\nas \u2018Roguelike\u2019 and if you weren\u2019t a\ngamer in the very early 80s you probably have no idea what this means.\nThis genre, pioneered by the fantasy\nRPG Rogue, involves randomised\ndungeons, and the rather mean concept of \u2018permadeath\u2019; once you died\nin Rogue, everything your character\nachieved is lost forever. It fell out\nof fashion by the late 80s, although\ninfluences of this genre still remain.\nThe Diablo series is famous for its\nrandomised environments and the\nmost recent instalment included the\naptly named hardcore mode, bringing permadeath back into the main-stream.\nFTL is essentially a roguelike game\nin space. You, the player, start with\na rudimentary ship and a skeleton\ncrew, and are tasked to deliver vital information to the other side of\na vast and random universe. Every\ntime you \u2018jump\u2019 your ship from star\nsystem to star system, some completely random event occurs. Maybe\nyou find a shop to buy new weapons and crew for your ship. Maybe\nit\u2019s some friendly travellers who\ngive you some fuel to help you on\nyour journey. More often than not\nthough, it\u2019s a hostile ship that just\nwants to blow you out of the sky\nand steal everything you\u2019ve got. The\nship to ship combat is the meat of\nthe game and boy it\u2019s both incredibly good and really quite hard. As\nwith any good roguelike game, death\nis completely permanent. If you die,\nthen everything you\u2019ve achieved in\nyour journey is dust and you\u2019re sent\nright back to the start of the game.\nIt\u2019s also here, where the sci-fi nerd in\nme screams with glee (I hope you\u2019re\ncharging him for your services \u2013\nGames Ed).\nOnce in battle, you have to manage both the ship\u2019s power consumption and the actions of your crew.\nThe weapons, shields, engines and a\nvariety of other systems have to be\npowered to function and you gain\nbonuses when they are manned by a\ncrew member. As you progress and\nunlock new weapons, systems, and\ncrew members, you realise how deep\nthe combat is. You can purchase a\ndrone bay and launch automated\ndrones to attack your enemies or\nrepair your ship. You could teleport\nyou crew into your enemy\u2019s ship and\npick off the enemy one crew member at a time. Or maybe you prefer\nbuying a cloaking device and being\nalmost impossible to hit. Of course\nas you progress to more difficult\nareas your enemies have all these\ncapabilities too. It\u2019s at these points\nthat the game can become incredibly overwhelming, especially on\nthe first few attempts. Often you\u2019re\ndealing with not only superior fire-power, but boarding parties wreaking havoc in your ship and maybe a\nfew fires to top it off. To succeed you\nmust learn to make use of the games\npause function. At any point you\ncan stop the action and issue several commands at once. Order one\ncrew member to repair the drone\nbay maybe? Target your weapons\non the enemy\u2019s O2\nsupply to suffocate the crew? Maybe open an air-lock to flush out the boarding party\nand that pesky fire? Of course when\nthe shit really hits the fan you can\nalways shout, in your best Captain\nKirk impression, \u2018Divert all power to\nthe engines!!\u2019 and jump the hell out\nof there. However, due to the random nature of the game, you have\nabsolutely no idea what to expect after that next jump. There have been\nmany situations where I\u2019ve jumped\nstraight from the frying pan and into\nthe fire.\nSee, the games random component\nis both its best feature and its worst.\nTo win FTL, you must not rush and\nshould instead focus primarily on\npreparing for the more difficult battles ahead. Sometimes you get lucky.\nA few easy battles, a free weapon\nfrom a nice stranger and maybe a\ncouple of new crew members enable you to really improve your ships\nperformance. Other times you just\njump into empty space, time and\ntime again, gaining nothing and losing fuel. Occasionally, the game can\njust be incredibly unfair and pit you\nin an absolutely horrible battle, testing you in every way. However, at\nthe end of the day, each time you hit\nthat \u2018New Game\u2019 button you know\nit\u2019s going to be a different adventure.\nAs you get better and more experienced in the game, you\u2019re rewarded\nwith new starting ships, making\neach new game even fresher.\nAs far as true criticisms go, events\nthat don\u2019t involve combat can be a\ntad dull. Occasionally you\u2019re asked\nif you want to send some crew\nmembers down to a planet, or help\na trapped ship stuck in an asteroid\nfield. These events are just displayed\nin boxes of text with a random out-come. You might gain\nsomething useful or\nsuffer damage to\nyour ship or even\nlose a vital crew\nmember. Also, I\u2019m not a huge fan\nof the game\u2019s crew-to-crew combat\nwhen boarding enemy ships, or being boarded yourself. These instances basically involve your crew and\nthe enemy crew, being in the same\nroom together, slowly picking away\nat each other\u2019s health. The only real\nstrategy seems to be to know when\nto quickly move your crew to a different room and it\u2019s far less exciting\nthat the true ship to ship combat.\nEach attempt at FTL is like its\nown self-contained episode of Star\nTrek \u2013 just where more often than\nnot, everyone dies at the end. Also,\non that note, I\u2019d recommend against\nnaming your starting crew mem-bers. I named a female crew member after my girlfriend and she got\neaten by a giant spider after about\nfive minutes of playing. It was sad.\nMichael Barclay Captain Pilchard\nGAMES\nFRIDAY 19 OCTOBER 37\nGames Editor: Ross Webster\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHi, I just warped here and\nthis is crazy, but we\u2019re being\nboarded... so drone bay maybe?\nNot everyone who reads Felix may be aware that there\u2019s a major competitive\nside to Team Fortress 2 a.k.a. Hat Fortress 2. Well, there is. Earlier this week, the\nteam sign-ups for Season 13 of the European Team Fortress 2 League opened\nup.\nIgnore the \u2018European\u2019 part of the name \u2013 this league is the largest competitive\nleague in the world. Also, forget the madness that you find on public servers\n\u2013 these games are for teams that communicate and coordinate their strategy,\nmaking for some amazing games.\nThere are divisions for all levels of play, so if you feel like gauging your skills\nagainst others, why not pop along to etf2l.org. Watch out for the Highlander\ngame-type, as it\u2019s great fun, even if you\u2019re just a spectator. As per the Highlander motto of \u201cThere can only be one\u201d, the TF2 Highlander rules insist that\nwithin your team of 9 players, each one must be a different class.\nHat Champions\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\n\n"

They may\nhave a point, but international festivals\nare de\ufb01nitely underrated.\nAs Open\u2019er was an evening-only\nevent, this provided time during the\nday to wonder around the cute little seaside town. A free shuttle bus\ndeparts every ten minutes from the\ncampsite to the centre which made it\nincredibly easy to make the most of\nGdynia.\nAlthough there were not very many\ntourist attractions, getting up at 11am\nand joining the epic queues for the\nhot (yes hot!) showers and having to\nreturn by 6pm meant there was not\nmuch time during the day to sightsee\nanyway. This made Gydnia the perfect\nsized town to spend the waiting time.\nHighlights included Barracuda, the\nbest seafood restaurant in Poland\noverlooking the Baltic Sea, the market\nsquare, Cold War style milk bars selling traditional Polish meals for around\n\u00a33 (main, dessert, and drink), and any\ncaf\u00e9 with a clean toilet.\nTo answer the obvious question of\nwhy was I able to get up as early as\n11am which is pretty lame for a festi-val-goer is because of my over-the-top\ndisgust of portaloos.\nThis meant that I missed out on the\ndiuretic nature of \u00a31.50 Heineken/\nDesperados pints. Unfortunately any\nother alcohol onsite (including the\ncampsite) is banned. This isn\u2019t really a\nproblem as everything is so cheap that\npre-drinking in a bar wouldn\u2019t set you\nback much.\nGetting around \ufb01ve zloty for \u00a31 is\none of the best parts about Poland as\na festival destination. Tickets cost \u00a370\nfor four evenings of music and seven\nnights\u2019 camping. Bargain!\nThe festival itself echoes the cosy\nnature of the town it is in. There were\nonly two main stages, with four others\nexhibiting smaller bands. There was\nalso a fashion stage, cinema and small\nart exhibition. Although this meant\nthere was not much choice in terms\nof acts, it is very convenient if you like\nmost of the artists as it means no sacri\ufb01cing and it does not take too long to\nget from one stage to another.\nHeadliners were Bjork, Justice,\nFranz Ferdinand, and the XX; although my personal highlight was\nM83 who managed to get the crowd\ndisgustingly sweaty. It was a good\nchance to check out Polish music, but\nhaving three quarters of the line up as\nsome of the best British acts at the mo-ment, it is di\ufb03cult to not want to miss\nthem.\nLily Le\nAMS album of the week\nIf there\u2019s one band who can wear the post-rock tag\nwithout shame, it\u2019s Godspeed You! Black Emperor,\nfamous for being able to capture the view of a city skyline burning and turn it into song. And they\u2019re back, af-terleavinguswiththesomewhatdisappointingYanqui\nU.X.O. in 2002.

Also dubbed \u201cArmchair Techno\u201d , it\u2019s a loosely de\ufb01ned term\nfor experimental electronic music. The\nsounds lumped under this label can vary\nwildly, from the hauntingly nostalgic to\ntracks with beats that go beyond the limits of danceability and syncopation into\nthe realm of pure fetishism. I want to\ntalk about a group from the former end\nof the spectrum: IDM mainstays Boards\nof Canada (BoC).\nThe world of Boards is a strange one:\nmembers Marcus Eoin and Michael\nSandison \ufb01rst began making music together in the 80s, releasing cassettes un-dertheirownlabel,Music70;nowsigned\nto Warp Records, they\u2019ve been working\nfor decades in the Pentland Hills, Scotland, having only emerged to play live\nten times in their entire career; most of\nthe material they produce remains unreleased (their second album, Geogaddi,\ncontained 22 songs culled from 400 fragments and 64 full tracks.)\nUsing a mixture of analogue synths,\ndrum machines and live recordings,\ntheirs is the reverse of the usual production process. When creating music, BoC\ntake individual sounds and progressively\ndestroy them, until they appear aged and\nworn. Part of this drive comes from their\nearly inspiration, the soundtracks to old\neducational documentaries produced\nby the National Film Board of Canada,\nfrom which their name is drawn.\nNowhere is this e\ufb00ect better demonstrated than on the aforementioned record Geogaddi, released with Warp in\n2005. Each track on Geogaddi is cracked\nand broken, giving this strong impression that you\u2019re listening to an ancient\ncassette, some long lost album that\u2019s\nbeen sitting in the glove-box of your\nparents\u2019 car. But because of this mental\nassociation with old equipment, heightened by BoC\u2019s preference for analogue\nsynths, the album actually feels infused\nwith warmth and nostalgia.\nTherein lies the dichotomy of Geogaddi; whereas the timbre is warm and\nrich, many of the songs themselves are\ndark and haunting things. Whether it\u2019s\nthe warped vocal samples, often from\nchildren, droning synths or some other\nunfamiliar sound, nearly all the songs on\nthe album have an eerie edge to them.\nThey feel charged with some unknown\nintent, infused with unfathomable\nmeaning. In a way this is often true, as\nthere is more to the music of Boards of\nCanada than initially meets the eye.\nTake the track \u2018Gyroscope\u2019\n. It features\na heavy, rolling beat, a synth line that\nsounds like it\u2019s running backwards and\nan unnerving sample of a child reading a\nsequence of numbers over and over. This\nsampleisinfactarecordingtakenfroma\nNumbers Station, unidenti\ufb01ed radio stations that broadcast female or child voices reading seemingly random sequences\nof numbers, possibly for espionage.\nEvery single track on Geogaddi is \ufb01lled\nwith tiny details like these: voice clips\nplayed backwards, forwards or slowed\ndown; samples of radio-wave phenom-ena; references to Branch Davidian\ncultism and hypnotism; a sample from\na dream sequence in a 70s horror \ufb01lm.\nThis is an album so intricate that someone actually reversed the whole thing\nand made it available to download on\nThe Pirate Bay, in some vain attempt to\ncast light on it\u2019s hidden details.\nThe sum of all these pieces is that Eoin\nand Sandison seem to take on the role\nof a pair of mad scientists performing a\nseries of experiments on the notion of\nnostalgia itself, bending it and warping\nit into di\ufb00erent forms until it\u2019s no longer\ndependable or familiar.\nBut, what makes Geogaddi, and in a\nbroader sense all BoC\u2019s work, really interesting is that their songs are not all\ndark and oppressive. This band is equally capable of producing upbeat dance\ntracks (\u2018Roygbiv\u2019\n, \u2018Julie\u2019 and \u2018Candy\u2019),\nhaunting but beautiful melodies (\u2018Turquoise Hexagon Sun\u2019), and even soaring euphoric pieces like my personal\nfavourite \u2018Dawn Chorus\u2019\n. Sandison described Geogaddi as a \u201ctwisting journey\nthat takes you into some pretty dark experiences before you reach the open air\nagain\u201d\n, and \u2018Dawn Chorus\u2019 marks that\npoint on the album. It\u2019s a gorgeous piece\nof retro-futurism, evocative of the space\nrace and the era when man envisaged\ncolonies on the Moon, with wobbling\nsynths and rich bass notes that wash\nover you like waves.\nAs I said near the beginning, the world\nof Boards is a strange and seemingly alienating one, but it is also incredibly rich\nand rewarding. In a world where pop-music is homogenising, this is a band\nwith an entirely unique sound, who\nhave done much to push the boundaries\nof electronic music.\n\n"

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n29\nFRIDAY 19 OCTOBER\nSo, being a complete and utter plebeian when it comes to art, I was talked\ninto going along to the Frieze Art Fair in order to critique the cutting edge of\nmodern art. O\ufb00 to Regents Park I trouped, accompanied by my VIP guide.\nOn arrival, I essentially became lost in a world of hipsters, art snobs and people\nwith too much money and too little to do, all of them wandering around, drawing\nthe meaning of life out of a colourful square or a picture of a penis. One of my personal favourites was a set of eight photographs of a man casually smearing his willy\nin mustard although, I must admit I wasn\u2019t quite able to grasp what the piece was\ntrying to tell me.\nIn amongst all the senseless colours and random shapes, some beautiful things\nwere to be seen and these did make the trip worth its while. In general though, I\nhave to say that almost the entire show flew over my head with one pretentious\nsqueal informing me that the world of modern art was still outstripping my mental\ncapacity.\nI conclude thus, that had I been high, drunk, or on mushrooms, Frieze could potentially have been a life changing experience. My sober slob self however, slumping around, was fundamentally intrigued. It didn\u2019t quite understand whether it was\nintrigued because of a random stunning piece or because it was trying to work out\nthe aesthetic appeal of a stack of tyres.\nThis was OK... View from an art virgin\nby Anthony Montpal\nThere were rays of light and plenty of good art scattered around amongst the\ndross. Yasumasa Morimura\u2019s Self Portrait as Marcel Duchamp is great, clever\nand concise. Duchamp was famous for misappropriating other people\u2019s work.\nThis is exactly what Mormimura has made a career doing. She creates self portraits referencing a series of artists and artworks from history, some of which\ncan be seen in the background of this image. Even the title is misleading as she\ntakes the part of Duchap\u2019s female companion in this image. Like good art the\npiece wraps up layers of meaning and questioning whilst retaining a striking and\nunique aesthetic.\nOther personal favourites were Kevin Crosgrave\u2019s beautiful paintings of workshops and Richard Patterson\u2019s piece Male Nude. If you had some spare cash you\nalso had the opportunity to take home a piece of Exhibition Road, with two small\nsculptures on sale from Tony Cragg.\nFrieze Masters\nWhy work? Instead, doodle all lecture long and then send us your drawings\nto arts.felix@ic.ac.uk.\nIn general, I was in a cynical mood for Frieze. You have to be willing to submerge\nyourself in a quagmire of emotions; you have to want to let yourself go, which can\nbe impossibe after attending an emotionally draining lecture on fluid flow. There\nare few emotions left over for the art. So, I was unable to choose a favourite piece.\nMy favourite moment however, took place as I was queueing for the cloakroom. A\ntall and skinny blonde woman, wearing long black gloves studded in gold, became\none of the best examples of bitchiness posing as politeness that I have ever wit-nessed. Being wondrously bitchy didn\u2019t help her appreciation for the cloakroom\nqueue cloakroom and she took her ire out on a girl working at the Fair. Surprisingly, for someone who had probably just spent a literal fortune at various galler-ies, she didn\u2019t get her way.\nThere was a sober elegance in the disposition of space at Frieze Masters and\nmany exquisite things on display. However, the art su\ufb00ered from being sunk in\nthe same market atmosphere that was present at Frieze itself. It was vaguely depressing to wander around the various galleries and \ufb01nd oneself unable to ignore\nthe bored gallerists on their iPads. Nonetheless, there was a lot in the marquee\nthat would have transcended the aura of money for even the most cynical of visi-tors. My favourite things, probably because they came as something of a surprise\nwere two pieces by American conceptual and minimalist artist Sol Le Witt. He is\nperhaps most famous for his wall drawings, but at the Lisson Gallery, it was possible to see a sculpture of his; stacked white cubes forming a staircase \u2013 perhaps\nto a minimalist heaven? The second of his pieces, diagonal lines in four directions (on paper) was not only incredibly aesthetically pleasing, but also brought\nto an image of clarity and calmness after the madness of the fair.\n\n"

Jack Nicholson infamously\nplays Jack Torrance, a struggling writer\nwho foolishly accepts a job as a hotel\ncaretaker \u2013 even in the knowledge that\nthe previous caretaker had gone insane\nand murdered his family. Of course,\nthings quickly take a turn for the\nworse. Deadly hedge mazes, lifts full\nof blood and the terrifying Room 237\nare only some of the horrors that await\nThe Shining\nTop 10 Scariest Films of All Time (spoilers rife!)\n1\n(1980)\n(1980)\nWell, it has to be said \u2013 if you\nlike your horror films brutal,\nbleak and swimming in\nblood, this is definitely\nthe one for you. Toby Hooper's Texas\nChainsaw Massacre was the gruesome\nfilm that took the immoral, inbred folk\nfrom Deliverance and turned them into a\nsick, aggressive, insane clan of merciless\ncannibals. Start with a very typical\nopening point of a van full of teens who\nrun out of petrol in just the wrong place\nin Texas, then throw in Leatherface (a\ncharming gentleman wearing human\nskin and carrying, yes, a chainsaw) and\nsome meat-hooks \u2013 and there\u2019s your\nrecipe for a pretty repugnant film that\nhad to fight for a distributor due to the\ngraphic violence. Before Leatherface\nbecame a squealing cross-dresser in the\npretty awful Texas Chainsaw Massacre:\nThe Next Generation, he was a hideous\nand raw horror icon, who would never\nhave considered a skirt.\nPsycho is definitely in the\nlist of the greatest thrillers\nof all time, and one of the\ngreatest parts in Alfred\nHitchcock's legendary CV.\nA true master of suspense and tension,\nHitchcock crafted a memorable horror\nexperience with a limited cast and\neven more limited budget. Nowadays,\nadmittedly, the actual content of Psycho\nisn't as shocking as it was when it was\nfirst released in 1960. However, it proves\nHitchcock\u2019s skill as a director that Psycho\nis still a nerve-wracking watch. The\nkilling of Janet Leigh's character (not\nto mention the accompanying score) is\nnow one of the most iconic extracts in\nHollywood history.\nPsycho is such a classic that a shot-for-shot remake was made in 1998.\nWouldn\u2019t waste your time on that one,\nbut honestly \u2013 the original is epic.\nPsycho\nWatch the whole film with\nthe lights on. At midday,\nwith the curtains open and\nthe radio on. And then get\nready to never, ever sleep\nagain. The movie's premise, a little girl\npossessed by a demon, is pretty freaky\nas just words on paper. But director\nWilliam Friedkin treats the horror of it\nall as if it were really happening next\ndoor to us. Before it can be defeated,\nthis demon must be believed in. Fathers\nKarras and Merrin spend the third\nact of the movie fighting the Devil for\ncontrol of the young girl\u2019s soul. And in\ndoing so, Karras, a man of wavering\nfaith throughout most of the movie,\nfinally believes in the only true good\nhe knows by sacrificing himself to save\nher. Although The Exorcist is the reason\nwhy so many exorcism movies flood the\nmarketplace \u2013 it is also the reason why\nthey never fully deliver.\nThe main reason Scream is so\nsuccessful is because we finally\nhave a group of characters\nthat have all seen the same\nscary films we have, and who\nare aware of all the clich\u00e9s that go along\nwith the genre. However, it seems that\nnobody knows more than the killer\n(\u2026.killers?) who plays with his victims\nmercilessly, asking them questions about\nold horror films to help them guess his\nnext move \u2013 an almost interactive game\nthat the viewers can play along with.\nDirector Wes Craven waits for as long\nas possible to pull out some very well-executed tense scenes, with the killer\u2019s\nfinal reveal being realistically terrifying.\nThe Exorcist Scream\n2 3 4 5\n(1974)\n(1974) (1960)\n(1960) (1973)\n(1973) (1996)\n(1996)\nOk, so it\u2019s a little bit\ncheesy. And the fashion\nis decidedly dodgy. But\nit was the 80\u2019s \u2013 and\nFriday the 13th is definitely effective.\nBefore this film came out \u2013 along with\nit\u2019s epic makeup effects produced by\nthe inimitable Tom Savini \u2013 the murder\nscenes in horror movies were nowhere\nevenclosetothevividnessorcreativeness\nof those in Friday the 13th. It might be\na little bit dated, but when the arrow\ngoes through the back of poor Kevin\u2019s\nneck, you still jump. Not to mention the\nscreams when the\ndeformed boy\njumps out the\nwater behind\nl o n g -suffering\nAlice.\nFriday the 13th\n6\n(1980)\n(1980)\nThe first in a very (very)\nlong line of \u2018shaky hand-held\nhome film\u2019 horror movies,\nsuch as uber-successful\nParanormal Activity, The Blair\nWitch Project is actually pretty scary.\nAdmittedly, with hindsight and a few\nyears\u2019 more filming experience, some\nof the scenes are a little bit obvious\nand slightly dated. But The Blair Witch\nProject came out in the 90\u2019s, when the\ninternet was in its infancy and spoilers\nwerenotpublisheddeterminedlybefore\nevery new scary movie release \u2013 in fact,\nthe internet was used in this case to\nconvince the public that the unnatural\ngoings-on in this film were real. Love it\nor hate it (\u2018cause it makes you dizzy), the\nuse of the\nshaky cam\nhere must\ntake credit\nfor a whole\nnew way of\nfreaking us\nout.\nYou know how, for some scary\nfilms, you have to turn the\nlights on for just a few scenes?\nWell in this film \u2013 don\u2019t bother\nturning them off. Suspiria gets\nright to the point with a brisk double\nmurder early on in the plot that involves\na young lady looking out into the dark\u2026\nonly to realise a pair of terrifying eyes are\nstaring back. This creepy start develops\ninto a few stabbings and hangings, and\nculminates with a gruesome death by\nstained-glass impalement for her and\nher friend. Although\na rather typical\ngiallo (Italian horror\nfilm), director Dario\nArgento proves\nmore than capable\nof creating an\nenvironment of horror\nand the supernatural \u2013\na good, creepy watch.\nSuspiria\nFantastic (sick?) director\nGeorge Romero single-handedly created the zombie\nfilm genre with Night of the\nLiving Dead in the sixties.\nTen years later, he used his massively\nsuccessful formula to make Dawn of the\nDead \u2013 the much bigger, much gorier,\nand much funnier younger brother of\nNight. The true brilliance of Dawn of the\nDead is the way in which it combined\nstandard, gruesome zombie carnage\nwith a humourous dose of satire and\nsocial commentary. The question at\nthe end of the movie seems to be left\nhanging: are modern Americans really\nso different from the shambling undead\nzombies? Unfortunately this message\nwas somewhat lost in the enjoyable, but\ndefinitely inferior, 2004 remake.\nYou know it\u2019s got to\nbe good if it\u2019s a Best\nPicture Oscar winner.\nThe Silence of the\nLambs is potentially\nthe scariest movie ever created around\npsychological attacks and deduction.\nYou can blame this film all you like\nfor the seemingly never-ending lame\nHannibal Lecter impressions, but it gave\nus one of the film industry\u2019s most iconic\nvillains \u2013 not to mention the pivotal role\nof Anthony Hopkins\u2019 career. Director\nJonathan Demme is utterly relentless\nwith the tension, succeeding where\nRidley Scott failed in his 2001 sequel,\nHannibal, by keeping the character of\nLecter less of a caricature \u2013 and more\nof a believable terror. So settle down\nto 1991\u2019s best film, maybe with a little\nChianti\u2026\nDawn of the Dead The Silence of the Lambs\n7 8\n9 10\n(1999)\n(1999)\n(1977)\n(1977)\n(1978)\n(1978) (1991)\n(1991)\nThe Blair Witch Project\nNot to mentio\nboy\nhe\nd\n-g\nThe Texas\nChainsaw Massacre\nby Lucy Wiles Film Editor\nviewers.

The Killing (1956)\nOne of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s less-known\nbut by no means inferior works, this\nis exactly how you should do a short,\nsnappy, smart heist movie. An ingenious conning scheme, a group of\nshady characters, and a whole load\nof complications that messes up the\nprotagonist\u2019s carefully planned ex-ecution. It\u2019s certainly compact, full of\nexhilarating twists, and unexpected\noutcomes that \ufb01t so perfectly with the\nbuild-up; an underrated, under-rec-ognised classic from a director whose\ndiversity in his work amazes and inspires even to this day.\n9. Rashomon (1950)\nWhen it comes to law and the justice\nsystem, the great Patty Hewes once\nsaid \u201ctrust no-one.\u201d And this solid,\ntightly scripted and structured offering from Japan\u2019s internationally\nacclaimed \ufb01lm director, Akira Kurosawa, shows exactly that. People see\nthings, observe and interpret events\nwith their own eyes, in their own\nviews, and when it suits them, they\ncan downright lie, even the ones we\nnever expected. It\u2019s foreign, black-and-white (two big turn-o\ufb00 factors\nfor some people) but it\u2019s an endlessly\nfascinating quest for the truth.\nRecently, the British Film Institute\n(BFI) released the results of their\ncelebrated poll, \u201cTHE GREATEST\nFILMS OF ALL TIME\u201d, in which they\nsurveyed \ufb01lm critics and directors to\nlist their ten favourite \ufb01lms. Now the\nFelix Film team, as much as we\u2019d love\nto, doesn\u2019t have that kind of time or\nresources. And so we decided to split\nthe \ufb01lms up according to the decades\nin which they were released. So every\nweek, we will present you with our\ntop \ufb01lms of each decade.\n8. Rear Window (1954)\nYou can\u2019t talk about thriller without\nthe name Alfred Hitchcock. The BFI\nran a tribute programme aptly named\n\u201cThe Genius of Hitchcock: Master of\nSuspense\u201d and the mentioned \ufb01lm is\na \ufb01ne example as to why he is considered to be an extraordinary \ufb01lmmaker. A wheelchair-bound man (James\nStewart), whilst observing his neighbours with his binoculars, suspects\nhe\u2019s witnessing criminal activities, a\nsuspicion that lands him in a lot of\ntrouble. Grace Kelly, at her glamor-ous, luminous best, also stars in his\nstylish ride.\n7. 12 Angry Men (1957)\nWhat could have been a potentially\nmonotonous courtroom drama turns\ninto a tense, incredibly detailed and\nlayered \ufb01lm that uncovers hidden\npieces of evidence that make up the\ncase twelve jurors are deliberating.\nWe know very little to begin with,\nand assume the defendant is guilty.\nBut one man (Henry Fonda) punches\nholes in the prosecution\u2019s case, slowly but surely winning over the stubborn group of men more interested\nin getting out of their claustrophobic\nsetting (expertly mounted by Sidney\nLumet) than serving justice.\n6. Singin\u2019 in the Rain (1952)\nThe \ufb01rst musical to enter our \u201cbest\nof\u201d lists and a worthy one at that, as\nwhenever it rains, we all \ufb01nd ourselves secretly humming to the titular song, with a dance sequence that\nremains as famous as the song itself.\nA de\ufb01nitive crowd-pleaser and one\nthat screams happiness and joy in\nall forms without ever overdoing it,\nwith songs and dance-numbers to\nmatch the colourful liveliness, it not\nonly tells a love story, but also looks\nat the \ufb01lm industry going through an\nimportant transition, from silent to\ncolour and sound.\n5. Some Like It Hot(1959)\nIt\u2019s a delightfully odd, eccentric, but\nmost importantly, timelessly hysterical\nscrewball comedy that never shows its\nage in its head-spinning dialogue and\ncleverly devised comedic chaos. As two\nmusicians (the two perfectly matched\nJack Lemmon, Tony Curtis) go on the\nrun for witnessing a deadly mob hit,\nthey decide it would be best to disguise themselves in drag, entering an\nall-female band. There, they both naturally fall for the ditzy, blonde lead singer\nSugar (Marilyn Monroe). Nobody\u2019s per-fect? Well, this \ufb01lm is pretty darn close\nto perfection.\n4. On the Waterfront (1954)\nEveryone tries, and fails, to recreate\nthe speech made by Marlon Brando\nin one of the most iconic roles of his\ncareer. Yes, the \u201cI coulda been a contender\u201d scene is so famous that Brando\u2019s performance here is considered\none of the most remarkable acting\nachievements anyone has ever put\non screen. The story of dockworker\nTerry Malloy\u2019s struggle against corruption and moral obscurity makes\nfor a deeply touching and fascinating watch, with Eva Marie Saint, in\nher \ufb01lm debut, as sweet, likable love\ninterest.\n3. Sunset Boulevard (1950)\nSitting alone in her worn-down mansion is Norma Desmond, played by\nthe \ufb01ery Gloria Swanson \ufb01ring o\ufb00\nicy one-liners. She is a silent movie\nstar who has faded away into obscurity ever since the \u201ctalkies\u201d started\nmaking more money. Enter Joe Gillis\n(William Holden), an aspiring Hollywood writer who hasn\u2019t quite cracked\nthe industry yet. Dreaming of glittering careers, the two decide to work\ntogether, although inevitably not everything can go that smoothly.

    "content": "NEWS\n4\nNews Editor: Aemun Reza\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 19 OCTOBER\nFeedback woes highlighted\nThe National Student Survey (NSS) was\nestablished in 2005 by HEFCE (the body\nadministering government funding of\nUK universities), in order to independently gather feedback from students\nabout their institutions. It is carried out\nevery year in the spring: \ufb01nal-year undergraduates in almost every university\nin the UK answer questions spanning a\nbroad range of topics, from the quality\nof teaching and assessment, to the adequacy of the learning resources avail-able, to their satisfaction with the Union.\nResponse is generally high: last year, two-thirdsofeligiblestudentstookthesurvey.\nOnce the results have been collected and\nprocessed,theyarereleasedtothepublic.\nSince the survey is the single biggest\nsource of student feedback available to\nuniversities, college administrators study\nits results carefully. The survey has tangible in\ufb02uence, too, since the scores are\na signi\ufb01cant factor in the calculation of\nuniversity league table rankings. In the\nin\ufb02uential Guardian University Guide,\nfor instance, a university\u2019s student satis-factionresultcomprises25%ofitsoverall\nscore. Imperial\u2019s poor showing in these\npollshavebeentheprimaryreasonforits\nrecent plummet in the league tables.\nHow did we do?\nAn analysis of the 2012 results makes\nfor some interesting reading. At Imperial, 86% of respondents agreed that\n\u201coverall, I am satis\ufb01ed with the quality\nof my course.\u201d This result is only marginally lower than the English average\nof 87%, though signi\ufb01cantly lower than\ncorresponding scores from institutions\nof similar prestige as Imperial.\nAnalysing responses to the survey\u2019s\nmore speci\ufb01c questions indicates the ar-easwheretheCollegeislacking.Asinthe\npast,studentfeedbackwasamajorstum-bling block. Only 55% of students said\nthey were happy with the feedback they\nhad received \u2013 the second lowest score\nin the country. This puts it miles behind\nits rivals: by comparison, the \ufb01gures for\nUCL and Kings are 60 and 61 per cent.\nMedics seem to epitomise this discontent at the lack of feedback. While 85%\nwere satis\ufb01ed with the overall quality of\nthe course, only 32% thought feedback\nhad helped them clarify things they did\nnot understand, and a mere 28% agreed\nthat they had \u201creceived detailed comments on my work.\u201d\nOne particularly disgruntled medic,\nasked by Felix to explain why they were\nso dissatis\ufb01ed with her course, replied:\n\u201cBecause our personal tutors don\u2019t know\nwho we are, our lecturers don\u2019t care who\nwe are and we basically just teach ourselves.\u201d\nInsu\ufb03cient feedback has been a recognised issue for a number of years, and\nthe College has taken some steps to address it, including imposing deadlines on\ndepartments for the returning of marked\nwork. This seems to have been re\ufb02ected\nin this year\u2019s results; 55% compared with\n51% last year. Though still not great, this\nis certainly an improvement.\nThe teaching scores, too, were far from\nspectacular \u2013 especially when compared\nwith other similarly prestigious institu-tions. Amongst the elite Russell Group\nUniversities, only students at LSE were\nmore dissatis\ufb01ed with teaching (while\nOxford and Cambridge topped the table\nin both teaching and feedback scores).\nSo where does all this dissatisfaction\ncome from? Various causes have been\nproposed: the usual suspects of a heavy\nworkload and moribund social life inevitably crop up. But when results are\ncompared across di\ufb00erent departments,\na more nuanced story emerges.\nStudents in Geology, for instance, did\nnot share their colleague\u2019s general dis-content: a whooping 92% were satis\ufb01ed\nwith the level of feedback, while 98%\nwere satis\ufb01ed with the overall course: far\nandawaythehighestscoreinCollege.Fe-lix talked to some Geologists to \ufb01nd out\nwhat their department was doing right:\n\u201cAs far as I know we\u2019re the only department to have an \u2018Academic Tutor\u2019 who\noversees all aspects of the undergraduate\ndegree. It\u2019s e\ufb00ectively the same as a Director of Undergraduate Studies \u2013 how-ever, from what I\u2019ve heard, ours is a lot\nmore dedicated to their job than others.\nShe knows everyone\u2019s names from interview day, and will still keep in touch after\ngraduation.\n\u201cI think people knowing each other\nis crucial to satisfaction with the degree\ncourse. If you\u2019re friends with so many\npeople in every other year as well as your\nown, you\u2019re going to enjoy your time in\nthe department. Obviously having such a\nsmall department helps with things like\nthis, however I think the social side of the\nRSMU contributes signi\ufb01cantly by putting on unmissable events that everyone\ngoes to and has a great time at.\u201d\nAnother student summed up this cooperative atmosphere: \u201cWe get a lot of\nsupport from Lorraine (the Academic\nTutor), everyone gets jobs in oil compa-nies, we have \ufb01eld trips, teachers all get\non well with the students and there is a\ngeneral feeling of camaraderie.\u201d\nIncontrast,only42%ofChemistrystudents found the feedback they received\nhelpful (though 87% thought their teachers were good at explaining things). Felix\nspoke to a chemistry student, who told\nus:\n\u201cThe main problem our year found\nwith feedback was that the quality of the\nfeedback you received depended signi\ufb01cantly on which person was marking\nyour script and which lab you were doing\nat the time.\u201d\nStill, there are some signs that things\nareimproving.Resultshavegenerallyim-proved from last year. Satisfaction with\nfeedback has risen 4%. Speaking with\n\ufb01rst and second-year students, it seems\nthat the changes the College has made\nin the last few years have had a tangible\ne\ufb00ect.\nOf course, these improvements won\u2019t\nbe fully seen in the survey results for\nanother few years. And in any case, it\ndoesn\u2019t re\ufb02ect well on the College that it\ntook some shocking survey results \u2013 and\na consequent plunge in the league tables\n\u2013 for them to take student satisfaction\nseriously.\nDoug Hunt, Deputy President (Educa-tion) gave Felix this statement about the\nNSS: \u201cImperial College Union believes\nthat the NSS is highly useful when taking\ninto account the changes that have been\nmade in some departments in order to\nimprove their NSS score especially with\nrespect to assessment and feedback. One\nexample of this is the restructuring of the\nchemistry course that has proven highly\npopular with students who have bene\ufb01ted from this.\nHowever the Union disagrees with\nheavily weighting the NSS satisfaction\nrankings in university league tables,\nwhich we feel misleads able prospective\nstudents and potentially devalues our\nhighlytalentedstudentsandalumni,who\nare of a world class quality.\u201d\nNavid Nabijou probes the latest results from the NSS\nImperial trails\nrivals in satisfaction ratings\nFeedback\nshown to be\nmajor issue\nNSS Subject Rankings\nNSS Russell Group Rankings\nSubject\nEarth and Marine Sciences\nMaterials\nCivil Engineering\nEEE\nPhysics\nComputer Science\nMedicine\nMechanical Engineering\nChemical Engineering\nMathematics\nBioscience\nChemistry\nTeaching\n98\n77\n82\n84\n87\n84\n91\n76\n78\n74\n83\n81\nFeedback\n92\n63\n50\n62\n52\n67\n49\n55\n58\n51\n49\n42\nOverall\n98\n89\n88\n88\n87\n85\n85\n81\n81\n80\n79\n78\nUniversity\nImperial\nCambridge\nSt. Andrews\nOxford\nDurham\nUCL\nQueen Mary\nBristol\nKCL\nLSE\nTeaching\n84\n93\n95\n93\n89\n87\n86\n90\n88\n82\nFeedback\n55\n75\n69\n72\n69\n61\n68\n66\n60\n68\nOverall\n85\n94\n93\n93\n90\n88\n88\n87\n84\n84\nAll of the figures are quoted as percentages.\nGeology on\ntop; Chemistry\ntrailing\n\n"

    "content": "MUSIC\nMusic Editors: Mark England,\nRoss Gray, Simon Hunter,\n\u00cd\u00f1igo Martinez de Rituerto\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nFRIDAY 19 OCTOBER\n34\nYou Don\u2019t Have To\nCall It Music\nPt. 2 a new ear for classical\nby \u00cd\u00f1igo Martinez de Rituerto\nClassical music has been all but abandoned by the generations following the\nXX Century iconoclasts. Swept aside by the hormonal avalanche of the baby\nboomers, modern music since Elvis turned to Africa for salvation from the\namorphous excursions of the decades before. Percussion has informed practically all non-classical music since then, from rock\u2019n\u2019roll to jazz, and eventually\nhip-hop and techno. Rhythm and simplicity were the order of the day. Hourlong orchestral narratives were no longer acceptable. In an age of accelera-tion, brevity was the only way to be heard.\nIn 2005, techno machinist Jeff Mills performed a selection of his tracks\nwith the Montpellier Philharmonic Orchestra. Tunes typically reserved for\nsweaty dancefloors in inhospitable locations were now met with cheers of\n\u201cBravo!\u201d The audience now danced to the conductor\u2019s lead, rather than politely nodding their heads in their seats. Recently, two legends of the Detroit\nand Berlin techno scences, Carl Craig and Moritz von Oswald, collaborated\non a reworking of two of classical\u2019s best-known pieces, Mussorgsky\u2019s Pictures\nat an Exhibition and Ravel\u2019s Bol\u00e9ro. Taking a studio recording from the Berlin\nPhilharmonic Orchestra as their source, the two sampled, recomposed and\nremixed the classics into an electro odyssey, mixing 4/4 beats with blaring\ntrumpets and scintillating violins.\nWith 2010\u2019s 1-bit Symphony, American sound artist Tristan Perich simultaneously redefined established recording practices, while contextualizing\nclassical music in the presence of modern advancements in technology. He\nprogrammed an entire symphony onto a standard microchip using 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s\n(binary assembly code), representing frequency simply as periodic sequences\nof digital bits. Packaged in a jewel case which held the circuitry instead of a\nCD, a flick of the switch ran the code and played the music. The symphony\nitself is composed of wonderful polyharmonics weaving in and out of each\nother, swelling in consonance and stupefying beauty.\nSome artists have taken the old guard not merely as a model but as an inspi-ration. Rene Hell\u2019s Porcelain Opera and The Terminal Symphony achieve the\nsame form of elegance as Mozart\u2019s most moving pieces, using only electronic\ninstruments like modular synthesizers and effect pedals more usually reserved\nfornoiseortechno.Thoughnotalwayspresentbeneaththecrumblinghiccups\nof failing circuitry, the harmony of an orchestra always lurks beneath the deep\nstreams of fuzz. But when they come up for air, they whisper something of an\nenlightenment to the ears, suddenly drenching the panorama with swathes of\ncolour and melody. Equally fragile and violent, teetering on the edge of collapse and always basked in some sort of orgasmic splendor, he makes circuits\nsing as if revealing a personality beneath them, one with emotions and memo-ries. His most recent split album with Oneohtrix Point Never is warmly reminiscent of Glenn Gould\u2019s recording of Bach\u2019s Goldberg Variations, where the\npianist can be heard intimately humming behind the microphone.\nC. Spencer Yeh is another tantalizing figure to blend the artistry of classical\nmusic with the chaotic tendencies of noise. He runs his electric violin through a\nplethora of signal processing units, endowing walls of fuzz with searing melodic\nflourishes. Challenger is one of the most arresting and awesome offerings in recent years. The juxtaposition of sensitivity and power is incredible to behold.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, classical music has also made some moves in break-core, a genre who\u2019s drug-addled exponents revel in complexity. Last Wednesday saw Aphex Twin perform at the Barbican with the Heritage Orchestra\nand Choir. A year ago, he and Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood adapted\nKrzysztof Penderecki\u2019s Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima in celebration\nof the Polish presidency of the EU.\nIn 2005, Venetian Snares, another venerable actor of the breakcore scene,\nreleased an album of unrelenting beats cut with samples of Bart\u00f3k, Stravinsky, Mahler, Paganini, Prokofiev and more. Already proficient in the exploitation of computational power to deliver his aural assault, he now used his\ntools to manipulate the magnificent works of more orthodox composers.\nThere has been some custom at the outer-limits of modern music to bow\ndown to the cornerstones which made phenomenological physiology of vibrating particles. The paradox lies in the movement from such unorthodox\nends of music to pay homage to ancient harmonic methods. After decades\nwhen technological progress informed the bounds of creativity, the avant\ngarde somehow harkened back to the craft and delicacy only human hands\ncould unravel.\nVan She do Koko\nVarious London clubs have o\ufb00ered\nFresher\u2019s Week deals, yet none of\nthem were quite as enticing as Koko\u2019s\nin Camden; an old theatre, with the\nstalls replaced with a dance \ufb02oor,\nthe circle with a bar and a 21st century sound system squeezed onto the\nVictoria stage. It\u2019s a beautiful venue\nwhich still retains its classical architecture and o\ufb00ers some of the best\nin \u2018up and coming\u2019 live music. Last\nFriday, it was the turn of the Aussies\nwith Van She, supported by Sans\nCisco to provide the entertainment\nfor its Club NME night.\nNormally \u00a32 before 10:30, \u00a34 before\n12 and \u00a37 after, the night was open\nfor free in celebration of freshers\u2019\nweek and once your correspondent\nhad bagged himself and his friends\u2019\nentry, we joined Sans Cisco\u2019s supporting set.\nSans Cisco dot the \u2018i\u2019 in indie. Or at\nleast try to. Top buttons done up and\nbeards carefully groomed, they were\nfun and likeable, if only a little bit like\nany other indie-pop band. They performed live well though, each player\ndistinguishable and useful, preventing the crafted melodies being lost\nin a decibel intensive live mash. They\nalso moved their drummer, Scarlett Stevens, forwards to front left.\nIt\u2019s nice to see a drummer showing\npresence and not just relying on being loud to be seen. Some songs were\npredictable \u2013 \u201cna na na na na\u201d is no\nlonger a good enough theme, it just\nisn\u2019t. Finishing on their single \u2018Awkward\u2019 though, a soulful duet between\nthe lead and the drummer, they left\nthe stage as a successful support, but\nwith the audience very much aware\nthat the highlight was when a rando-mer jumped on the stage and shouted\ninto the lead singer\u2019s mic.\nIt was then the turn of head-liners\nVan She to take the stage. Hailing\nfrom Sydney, they\u2019ve supported Yeah\nYeah Yeahs, Daft Punk, Bloc Party\nand Phoenix. No pressure then. Electro-pop reminiscent of the \u201880s with\nbig synthesiser sounds, listening to\ntheir recordings they are thoughtfully\nproduced if a little repetitive. A less\ndiverse Django Django if you like.\nLive; well, very similar, except that\nnow repetitive isn\u2019t such a bad thing.\nThey played their new music, be-cause, well, nobody knows their old\nstu\ufb00 so they may as well. Highlights\nincluded \u2018Kelly\u2019, \u2018So High\u2019 and \ufb01nishing with \u2018Jamaica\u2019, so called because\nit features a steel pan sample which\ndisappointingly wasn\u2019t performed\nlive. Perhaps they save that for Daft\nPunk. That said, it\u2019s a brilliant song\nwhich forced even myself to pretend\nto dance. It was going so well.\nMore venues need to incorporate\nlive music into club nights, so much\nmore fun than having a DJ blast the\nsame old songs in your general direc-tion. The atmosphere was friendly,\nprogressive and lacked the leery men\nin the corner or the bikini clad door\ngirls. Give it a go.\nDisappointed by the support act. Screw this, let\u2019s go shopping. I need a haircut.\nMovements in the deep of night\nFellow Bristolian Vessel\u2019s 2012 of-fering, Order of Noise, manages to\nsuccessfully intertwine dark ambient,\nglitch, dub and techno to throw us\nback to those grimy Bristol moments\nwhere the stims have ran out and everyone is desperately caning the keta-mine, milking the absolute last out of\nthe depraved party that has just run its\ncourse.\nReleased on newly famous \u2018witchhouse\u2019 label Tri Angle, which tends to\nrepresent a whole plethora of left-\ufb01eld\nelectronica (e.g. Holy Other, Clams\nCasino), Order of Noise presumably\nstemmed from ideas born in raves under disused railway bridges. Its main\nskeleton consists of re\ufb01ned wobbles\nthat make hooded heads bob combined with beats darting from quietly\nthumping industrial-techno 4/4 to the\nbarebones militaristic breakbeats so\noften associated with dubstep; subtle\nbut utterly danceable.\nIn ways, the record is somewhat\nreminiscent of Actress\u2019 fantastic R.I.P.\nVessel lays found sound and lo-\ufb01 samples over a darkly sparse soundscape\nthat really forces you to focus on the\nminutiae of his work. Orchestral\nsweeps, dragged through muddy \ufb01lters, similar to William Basinksi\u2019s The\nDisintegration Loops; slowed down,\ngrunting vocal samples; and short, jarring bursts of glitch noise add to the\ndisturbed euphoria pro\ufb00ered.\nPerhaps the most arresting element\nof the album is how on a \ufb01rst listen it\nseems, whilst still great, fragmented\nand \ufb02eeting \u2013 too broken and empty\nto have any drive, nearly an ambient\nalbum. As you listen again, the album\nstarts developing this drive, small and\nhard to detect though it is. Beats (no\nmatter how quiet) constantly running,\nlayers very slowly building in density\nuntil the fantastic climax of \u2018Court of\nLions\u2019. Swelling ethereal synths run\nin conjunction with more standard\ndance fare like a perfectly developing\npulsing synth, dancing under and over\nthe soft, restrained and steady beat.\nAs eluded to in the opening para-graph, whilst this is a special listen\nany time of day (especially for anyone\nwho is well acquainted with the Bristol music and club scene), the time\nit truly shines is at 8am after going\nhard all night. Next time you\u2019re feeling burnt out after 6 hours of clubbing\nand 2 hours of night buses, instead of\nreaching for your skins and The KLF\u2019s\nChill Out, grab some hard depressants\nand dive deep into the world of Vessel.\nGeorge Butcher\nCongratulations to\nWill Pote\nand\nJeany Tan\nfor destroying last week\u2019s\nMS Paint competition\nRoss Gray\n\n"

De\ufb01nitely worth a watch for hip\nhop or non-hip hop fans alike.\nKaty Bettany Film Editor\nthe gypsies involved in illegal \ufb01ghting\n(women unwelcome), standing tall on\nnewly \ufb01tted prostheses, she becomes\nthe queen of strength and bad girl.\nA \ufb01lm with so\nmuch tragedy could\neasily become\nm e l o d r a m a t i c ,\nbut it isn\u2019t \u2013 its\nminimal script and\nabrupt switches\nbetween realism and\nexpressionism keeps\nthe \ufb01lm sobering and\nunflinching. Audiard\nexperiments with light\nand texture, and uses\nsound layering \u2013 often\nloud and confusing\nenough to obscure the\ndialogue, to reflect\nthe chaotic and fragile\nnature of Ali and\nSt\u00e9phanie\u2019s relationship.\nThe \ufb01lm\u2019s soundtrack is often\nunexpected, opening and closing\nwith Bon Iver\u2019s haunting double part\n\u2018Wolves\u2019. Also featured is Katy Perry\u2019s\n\u2018Firework\u2019, an unusual choice for a\npowerful scene which features a newly\ndisabled Cotillard re-enacting her Orca\nroutine to the sky. It is a great testament\nto Audiard\u2019s skill to take such an obvious\nsong and use it to enhance a scene of\ngreat profundity.\nDespite excellent\nperformances\nfrom Cotillard,\nSchoenaerts\nand Verdure, the\n\ufb01lm could at times\nfeel episodic and\nunconnected;withevents\npunctuating a seemingly\naimless screenplay rather\nthan \ufb01tting together to\nform a cohesive piece. Nonetheless, the\nalmost symbiotic relationship between\nAli and Sam is deeply impressive; fraught\nwith love and rage. When Sam is put in\nmortal danger, our reaction, like Ali\u2019s, is\nvisceral. Cotillard acts with her body as\nmuch as with her voice \u2013 each movement\ndeliberate and instinctual. Coupled with\nsome clever CGI work, her portrayal\nof an amputee is as believable as it is\nmoving.\nThis is a \ufb01lm about approaches to the\nhuman body \u2013 it is about pain that is\nsought and pain that is inflicted. The\ntheme of control is explored \u2013 with\nobvious parallels drawn between Ali\nand the whales, with St\u00e9phanie\u2019s need\nto control large mammals. Ever present\nis the power of nature, of the cycles of\ndegradation and renewal, and physical\nstrength.

This is a \ufb01lm with a\nstrong political message; touching upon\nthe lost generation, black oppression\nand Australia\u2019s murky past \u2013 but far\nfrom reveling in darkness, it is a joyful\ncelebration of a group of Aborigine\nwomen who break the shackles of racism\nto sing soul music to US troops during\nthe Vietnam war.\nBased on the true story of writer\nTony Briggs\u2019 mother and aunt, and\nadaption of the successful stage show,\nit is 1968 and four Aborigine women\nmeet a hapless Irish man, Dave Lovelace\n(O\u2019Dowd), whilst performing in a\nwhites-only Outback pub. Despite their\nlove of Country and Western, he quickly\nidenti\ufb01es them as the best thing around,\nbecomes their manager, converts them\nto soul, and embarks with them on a\njourney to Saigon to entertain the US\nmarine corps.\nThe \ufb01lm explores an important part\nof Australian history. From the 1800s\nwell into the 70s, pale skinned Aborigine\nchildren were taken from their families\nby Federal and State officials in the\nshameful attempt to integrate the\nchildren with white people, misguidedly\nbelieving that the\nblack population\nwould \u2018die out\u2019.\nThese children\nwould form the\n\u2018Lost Generation\u2019,\npart of Australia\u2019s\npast I\u2019m sure it\nwould rather forget:\nhowever, the \ufb01lm does not whine or\nlabour the point. Kay, a member of the\nLost Generation, reconnects with her\nindigenous roots, making peace with the\nfamily she lost in her childhood. The \ufb01lm\nisabouthealing,forgiveness,andmoving\nforward \u2013 something that modern day\nAustralians living in a country that still\nstruggles with racism, will connect with.\nThe sisters are as one dimensional\nas the signs Lovelace hangs around\ntheir necks to remind him \u2013 and them\n\u2013 of their roles.

The four\nlack serious character development for\nthis to be a truly exceptional \ufb01lm, but\nthe vocals are fantastic, and O\u2019Dowd,\nfresh from his success in Bridesmaids, is\nreliably funny, providing some laugh out\nloud moments, and is a convincing soul\nman.\nThe soundtrack is the true star of the\n\ufb01lm.CoversofSmokeyRobinson,Marvin\nGayeandFourTops,andoriginalsbySam\nand Dave, make this \ufb01lm a celebration\nof authentic Motown soul. Mauboy\u2019s\nvoice is made for soul; rich, deep with\nincredible range; but at times the girls\nlack the emotional connection with the\nclassic songs to really shine. The most\nmoving songs are the ones sung in Yorta\nYorta, an indigenous language: it is here\nyou can hear the plight of the Aborigine\npeople loudest.\nMaking comparisons to the\nsimilar Dreamgirls will only lead to\ndisappointment. Go with an open\nmind and the willingness to forgive the\noccasional weak moment - if you love\nsoul music this is a feel-good \ufb01lm not to\nbe missed.\n\n"

A so\nA new clinical trial from joint research with Imperial College an\nw\nw\nw\nWhat is hayfever?\nA little history...\nFirst scientifically described in 1819 by John\nBostock, hay fever, also known as allergic rhi-nitis, is an allergic reaction to small particles\nin the air that most commonly causes nasal\ninflammation but may also result in watery\neyes and itching throat. These symptoms are\nthe result of the airborne allergens triggering\nthe production of histamine, which produces\ninflammation. While most people experience\nonly mild effects the condition can cause severe disruption in people lives and may exacerbate the symptoms of asthma.\nAllergy or something else?\nDespite the condition\u2019s name, hay very rarely\nproduces an allergic reaction. Sufferers instead find themselves hypersensitive to wind\ndistributed pollen, most commonly that of\ngrass, which is responsible for some 90% of\ncases, but also that of certain trees (such as\nbirch) and other plants.\nWhile pollen levels are generally highest\nin late spring and early summer, different\nweeds flower through the entire period from\nearly spring to autumn; hay fever symptoms\nmay also be caused by dust, pet hair and\nfungal spores \u2014 meaning that some people\nexperience the condition year round. In rare\ncases \u2018cross-reactivity\u2019 may occur \u2014 with hay\nfever sufferers experiencing an allergic reaction to certain foods, such as apples, which\ncontain similar proteins to those found in\npollen grains.\nSome one fifth of the population experience hay fever, and while it can affect anybody it is most common amongst those with\na family history of allergies. The condition\nusually first manifests in the early teens and\nreduces in severity in the sufferer\u2019s 20s \u2014 in\nup to 20% of cases, all symptoms permanently dissapear in the end.\nWhat is PollenLITE?\nNatural Remedies\nContributions by Philip Kent, Mimi Li, Maciej Matuszewski, Annina Sartor, Philippa Skett, and Jacob Ward\nPollenLITE is a new type of vaccine aiming\nto prevent hay fever symptoms triggered\nduring grass pollen season. Instead of treating the symptoms, like the over-the-counter\nanti-histamines found in your local pharma-cist, pollenLITE prevents these symptoms in\nthe first place by \u201cturning off\u201d the allergic\nreaction.\nThe potential for a vaccine like pollenLITE\nwas first hinted at in a study published in\n2011, where researchers at Imperial discovered that long-term tolerance to grass pollen\nis accompanied by special \u201cblocking\u201d antibodies remaining in the body.\nEarlier this year, a study by the same group\nfound that repeatedly exposing people to\nlow doses of grass pollen beneath the skin\ncan cause these antibodies to appear, and so\ncreate a long-term tolerance to grass pollen.\nThe evidence from these studies triggered\nthe clinical trial for pollenLITE \u2013 a potential\nhay fever vaccine that uses smaller doses and\nshallower injections compared to previous\nversions.\nPollenLITE is currently in the recruiting\nphase for volunteers, with an advertising\ncampaign including Tube adverts, for trial\ninjections starting in early 2013.\npollenLITE [...]\n\u201cturning off\u201d\nthe allergic\nreaction.\nDOI: 10.1016/j.jaci.2010.12.1080\nDOI: 10.1016/j.jaci.2012.06.052\nIn numbers...(data from the University of Worcester\n78% of hayfever\nsufferers feel it\ndetrements their\nquality of life\n95% of hayfever\nsufferers are\nallergic to grass\npollen\nSufferers\nsay their\nproductivity is\nreduced by 63%\n54% of sufferers\nfeel less\nattractive using\npeak periods\nFor all the hippies out there, you will be sorry\nto hear that alternative cures are somewhat\nlacking when it comes to significant remedial properties. Complementary Alternative\nMedicine, also lovingly referred to as CAMs,\nconsist of yoga, homeopathy and herbal\nmedicines, and up to 70% of sufferers have\nbeen known to give these a go in there times\nof need. Meanwhile, some literature suggests that acupuncture may relieve some\nsymptoms.\nAcupuncture is an age old Chinese remedy\nthat is based on the principle that humans\nhave energy \u201cflows\u201d throughout the body,\nand that the balances of these such \u201cflows\u201d\ncan be disturbed, resulting in pain. Naturally\nthe correction of these flows is done via the\ninsertion of needles into exact points on the\nbody surface, and some people truly swear\nby it.\nHowever, if you are a sceptical scientist\nlike all Imperial students should be, consider\nwith caution the legitimacy of this, as published trials are sketchy in both the methodology and the results they present.\nBut if you still can\u2019t face putting money\ninto GSK\u2019s ever expanding pocket, consider\n\u201cherbal medicines\u201d. Despite modern medicine having primarily plant-based derivatives anyway, many Earth-lovers consider it\nacceptable to categorise their own, poorly\nstandardised medicine niche as \u201cherbal\u201d to\nrid them of the guilt of using them.\nIf this applies to you, at least aim to use\nplants such as butterbur (a girly little daisy),\nwhich was proven by one trial to be similar\nin effect as fexofenadine, a commonly used\nanti-histamine.\nHowever, as with all herbal medicines, you\nrun the risk of suffering from adverse side effects and potentially high toxicity exposure,\nalongside pharmacological interactions with\nother drugs that may be taken that are still\nnot understood.\n\n"

I hope I\u2019m not speaking\ntoo soon...\nAnonymous, via email\nWe do occasionally edit letters and comments we receive to improve spelling,\ngrammar, and clarity of expression.\nOnline\nOur pick of the most intriguing comments from felixonline.co.uk\nSir,\nAs a member of sta\ufb00 for Commercial\nServices and a parent who is supporting their two children who are currently at university, I am fed up of watching my own division wasting any pro\ufb01t\nor surplus funds they may have on\nparties (see invitation below) for sta\ufb00\nmembers rather than ploughing this\nback into the College or even o\ufb00ering\nit to sponsor less fortunate students.\nThese events are just free drinks and\nfood all night for sta\ufb00 who do a good\njob but no more than any other member of sta\ufb00 at Imperial.\nAnonymous, via post\nSir,\nThe author of the letter criticising the\npersonal hygiene habits of Computing\nstudents in last week\u2019s issue needs to\nmeet some of the sta\ufb00!\nAnonymous, via website\nare making on a day to day basis as we\nall try keep the Union a\ufb02oat (not like\nwe\u2019re sinking or anything, but you\u2019d\nbe surprised how much time in each\nday is spent keeping up with things\nand dealing with urgent problems\nover being able to press ahead and\n\u201cmake change happen\u201d). So if you ever\ndo need to hold a sabb to account for\nsomething serious, students will, and\nthe sovereign body of the Union will,\nbe wholly empowered to do so.\nA dic(k-tator) President has their\npower lessened by more representation on the Trustee Board of the whole\nsabbatical team. It is after-all the team\nthat students elect to run the Union \u2013\nnot just the President.\nNot that this is a \u2018reason\u2019 as such,\nbut the Deputy Presidents are the least\npowerful sabbs in the country \u2013 most\nother Unions have all (or a large percentage of sabbs) on their governing\nbodies. This doesn\u2019t make the rest of\nthe student voice weaker by any means\nthough: sabbs are still going to be outnumbered massively on the Board. In\nfact: the Board will be majority elected\n(campus-wide). The Board will be majority students. And any member of\nthe Board will be removable by a 2/3\nmajority vote of Council.\nChanges that probably more people\nwill care about include \u2018\ufb02attening\u2019 the\nFaculty/Constituent Union structure,\nso there are simply just constituent\nparts of the Union. All Unions within\nthe Union (CGCU, GSA, ICSMSU,\nRCSU, RSM, Silwood) will be the\nsame.\nA body that creates and co-ordi-nates the Union\u2019s responses to government policy changes should exist. At\nthe minute, it\u2019s the President, DPE and\nsome of the Union\u2019s representation\nsta\ufb00. This doesn\u2019t involve any \u2018proper\u2019\nstudents, and as such is something we\nshould change. By splitting our pretty\nredundant \u2018Representation & Welfare\nBoard\u2019 \u2013 which, as a subset of Council,\nhas failed to produce anything worthwhile in recent years \u2013 into \u2018Education\n& Representation Board\u2019 and a \u2018Communities & Welfare Board\u2019, I hope to\nform groups that will direct and drive\nforward policy responses from students \u2013 making the Union truly student (not sabb) led.\nSpeeding up the Elections process\ncan be done a few ways. The big question is how do we make sure we\u2019re fast\nand fair. One problem the Union has\nwrestled with in the past is how to appear non-biased. A student Returning\nO\ufb03cer (the person who decides who\u2019s\nright, who\u2019s wrong in a complaint situ-ation) has to be completely detached\nfrom the people involved in the elec-tion, and has to be utterly unbiased.\nPerceptions that this may not be the\ncase (even though it is\u2026) have grown\nas the people involved in the elections\nhave complained about the decisions\nthe Returning O\ufb03cer has made to ensure the elections are fair to all concerned and it\u2019s taken the Union a while\nto release results until all complaints\nare satis\ufb01ed.\nThe proposals are to take the politics\nout of the elections before they start\n\u2013 by appointing an external, disconnected person to oversee the process.\nThis person \u2013 with no contact to candidates prior to the election \u2013 will be\ncompletely impartial, and will be the\n\ufb01nal authority to complain to: speeding up the process of providing results\nto the student body.\nSo there we are \u2013 a less-than-two-thousand-words summary of everything that is going on. If you have\nany questions \u2013 big or small \u2013 on the\nchanges, I urge you to ask me. I\u2019m\naround the Union from 08:30 \u2018til 20:00\npretty much six days a week (some-times working, sometimes in the\nbar\u2026). The full proposals are available\non the Union website. They are being\ntaken to Union Council on 30 October, which will next meet at 18:30 in\nthe Union Dining Hall on Level 1. All\nfull members are able and are welcome\nto attend with full speaking rights.\nSir,\nIs there some kind of competition between the Film section editors to sneak\nin the most suggestive headlines? Keep\nthem coming...

There\u2019s not need to be so sensitive that the fact others are easily\nentertained by the beloved Mayor\u2019s sends you into spasms of rage. If you\u2019re not\namused, just roll your eyes and ignore him.\nThere\u2019s no way this can be some kind of permanent frustration for you, either. I\nmove in quite political circles and I only rarely hear mention of Boris\u2019 latest esca-pades. If, as you say, you\u2019re no fan of Conservatism, and thus prefer to spend your\ntime with normal people, then I can only imagine your exposure to Boris-based\nbanter is even lower than my own.\nUntwist your knickers, my good man. If someone mentioning once in a blue moon\nthat our Mayor made a lovable fool of himself lately is capable of inducing such\nvitriolic RAGE as is displayed in this column, then I can only prescribe a whole\nbottle of Chill-Pills.\nSir,\nI\u2019m totally loving the new Pie Shop\nnear the JCR. The only snag is that the\nplastic cutlery is not currently rigid\nenough to pierce the pie itself.\nAnonymous, via website\nJula Humphries\nhen I was born\n\u2013 hopefully a joyous occasion for\nmy family \u2013 my\nfather trotted o\ufb00\nto the post o\ufb03ce to send a telegram to my\nBabcia & Dziadek (that\u2019s my grandfather\nand grandmother) in Poland. This was\nonly the early nineties; I\u2019m not as old as\nthe hills yet. I don\u2019t really need to go into\nthe technological boom of the past two\ndecades, but just consider for a moment\nwhat life is like now. For instance, I\u2019ve just\nopened an email from my Dziadek and\nonly yesterday I spoke to my grandparents via Skype. And they are both Facebook users.\nIn fact we manage our long-distance-relationship quite well. I\u2019m not the only\none in this boat, many I know have parents on their account and some have\ngrandparents too. It must vary from family to family. Mind you, rumour even has\nit that the golden oldies are the fastest\ngrowing group of users on the social net-work. This cannot be veri\ufb01ed from data as\nof this year but it was reported so in 2011.\nSo what\u2019s the deal? Well, unless you\u2019re a\nperfect little angel, there are certain rules\nthat maybe should be followed if you\u2019re\ngoing to have your family on a social networking site. But this depends on what\nkind of grandparents you\u2019ve got. If they\u2019re\nthe \u00fcber strict type, it might not be wise\nto connect via this medium at all.\nActually, I\u2019ll scrap that and cut it down\nto one rule.\nThe golden rule: set it so you have to\napprove what\u2019s posted on your timeline.\nIf you do this, you can \ufb01gure out what\u2019s\nacceptable and what\u2019s not on a post by\npost basis. And to be perfectly honest,\nsocial networking sites represent you as a\nperson, so you ought to be careful of how\nyou display yourself to others, regardless\nof who you are friends with.\nBeware what you share\n...

The bad news is that\nwe are all hopeless optimists; but on\nthe positive side, research published\nin PNAS last month suggests we can\nbe cured.\nPrevious research had shown that\nwe tend to process positive and negative information di\ufb00erently. When\nupdating our beliefs in response to\nnew intelligence, we react in the rational and expected way in response\nto good news. However, when told\nsomething we don\u2019t want to hear, we\ntend to discount it and fail to adjust\nour beliefs and expectations accord-ingly.\nThis so-called \u2018good news/bad news\ne\ufb00ect\u2019 is thought to contribute to the\nhuman error that occurs in such diverse scenarios as medical decision-making, responses to natural disasters and \ufb01nancial market bubbles.\nHere the researchers used tran-scranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)\nto disrupt the function of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), the region\nof the brain that previous studies had\nshown to be implicated in the \u2018good\nnews/bad news\u2019 bias.\nParticipants were given descriptions of \u2018adverse life events\u2019 and asked\nto estimate how much at-risk they\npersonally felt in each case.

Get in touch now!\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFacebook facebook.com/Felixscience\nIn the UK, 820,000 people su\ufb00er with\ndementia and by 2051 this \ufb01gure may\nrise to 1.7 million. The Foundation for\nScience and Technology highlighted\nthis societal challenge by inviting four\nspeakers to talk about the issue from\nunique perspectives.\nThe debate was started by Chief\nMedical O\ufb03cer, Professor Dame Sally Davies DBE FMedSci. She spoke\nabout the need to diagnose earlier: \u201cIf\nit is picked up early, the drugs that are\navailable can extend good quality period.\u201d Only 31% of GPs feel they have\nhad su\ufb03cient training to diagnose de-mentia.\nShe also argued that in order to rid\nthe stigma, all sectors of society must\nunderstand. This is being done by the\nDementia Awareness Campaign as\npart of the Prime Minister\u2019s Dementia Challenge strategy. \u201c67% of people with dementia said they su\ufb00ered\nloneliness, isolation, anxiety and de-pression. One person talked about his\ndi\ufb03culties of getting his money out\nthe bank because he can\u2019t remember\npasswords and PIN numbers.\u201d\nThe following speaker, Professor\nJulienne Meyer, director of the My\nHome Life programme at City University, develops action research and uses\nit to improve care home qualities. She\nworks with the Government to carry\nout its initiative of creating dementia\nfriendly communities involving those\nwho live, die, visit and work in homes.\n\u201cThey are coming into care homes\nat a point of crisis so I really welcome\nopening up to volunteers to educate\nthe public to start thinking about their\nown frailty and end of life.\n\u201cSociety has turned its back on care\nhomes. We are ageist. We fear our\nown end of life. We fear dementia.\u201d\nThese social perspectives were complemented with a speech from Professor James Goodwin, Head of Research\nat Age UK.\nTheir Disconnected Mind project\nhas led to more understanding of the\nbiology of the disease. The project\nfound that genetic factors account for\n24% of variation in change in cognitive\nability.\n\u201cWe know what are the processes by\nwhich we can move research into tangible bene\ufb01ts. The complex interaction between researchers and users is\nthe rate-limiting step.\u201d The researcher\nmay not reach out to the policy makers because they don\u2019t trust policy\nmakers to utilise their research well,\nand the practitioner may be sceptical\nof the applicative potential of research\n\ufb01ndings.\nHe also said that limitation also\ncomes under the form of funding,\nwhere only 0.2% of R&D in the UK was\nspent on dementia research in 2009.\nThe \ufb01nal speaker was Jan Hall,\nfounder of the Evington Initiative\nwhich raises money for dementia re-search.

However,\nfollowing research recently published\nin Science, this may no longer be the\ncase, with the production of a complimentary metal-oxide semiconductor\n(CMOS) that can physically disappear\nat the end of use.\nA set of materials, based on either\nmagnesium or silicon, dissolve after a certain period of time through\na chemical reaction where water can\npull the metal centres of the CMOS\nstructures, so forming a chemical\nbond, which then results in the CMOS\nbeing dissolved. This goes via a simple\nchemical reaction:\nSi + 4H2\nO -> Si(OH)4\n+ 2H2\n.\nThe di\ufb00erence between this and\na traditional PCB is the way it is en-cased: the dissolvable electronics are\nenclosed within a silk structure, and it\nis the structure of this silk that a\ufb00ects\nhow well the circuit dissolves: circuits\nhave been formed which last from 10\nminutes to nearly 12 days. This is all\nthanks to changing how crystalline\nthe silk is. It is worth noting, however,\nthat the team reported success with\nother biodegradable polymers.\nExtreme conditions are also not re-quired, with the structure successfully\ndissolving at both body temperature\nand room temperature, opening the\navenue for medical applications.\nTrials of this technology in live organisms has already been undertaken,\nwith experiments on rats resulting in\nhuge success: three weeks after implantation showed the structure having almost fully dissolved, with only\nfaint residue of the original electronics remaining. The circuit in question,\na set of two RF antennae connected to\nheaters allowed the heat of the circuit\nto be controlled via radio waves, to\ngreat success: the circuit could be seen\nin a thermal image when controlled.\nThis also worked when implanted beneath the skin.\nThis speci\ufb01c application is useful as\nit shows how this technology can be\nused to facilitate thermal therapy after\nsurgery to control infections.\nThe Illinois team, lead by John Rogers is currently investigating full-scale\nmanufacture of the dissolvable systems through discussions with found-ries. Additionally, potential circuits\nare being devised for speci\ufb01c use cas-es, with possibilities available in both\nthe medical and consumer markets.\nRogers has made the news in the\npast for embedding circuits into life\nforms, with a \ufb02exible, implantable\nLED array being announced in 2010,\nand last year saw a temporary tattoo\ncontaining electronic circuits, with\nsimilar medical applications as this.\nDOI: 10.1126/science.1226325\nPhilip Kent Science Editor\nerage risks for their socio-economic\ngroup.\nThe control group reacted as ex-pected, failing to update their risk estimate in response to negative infor-mation.

    "content": "Gamer girls get the shaft...\nMichael Barclay ponders the roles of women in gaming culture\nhe fact that the majority of gamers are male\nis hardly a controversial\nstatement. It\u2019s almost\ntautological. Guys like\ngames, girls don\u2019t. Yet, fundamentally,\nI don\u2019t see why one\u2019s fondness of gaming should be so dominated by a person\u2019s sex. Games are, at their most basic level, just interactive media. When\nyou think about games a bit more you\ncan see why they\u2019re so male dominat-ed; you can see why I spent a lot of my\nchildhood playing on my Sega Megadrive and my sisters didn\u2019t. Maybe it\u2019s\nsome ingrained gender pigeon-holing\nbut little boys seem to prefer playing\nwith toy soldiers, whilst little girls end\nup playing with dolls. When you look\nat the majority of games out there\nthey generally seem to involve shooting and killing stu\ufb00 and I guess that\u2019s\nmore appealing to a 7 year old boy\nthan a 7 year old girl.\nEven when you move to games marketed for more adult audiences, the\ngaming industry has hardly helped\nthings. The origins of Lara Croft,\nperhaps the \ufb01rst mainstream female\ngaming protagonist are a rather dubious tale. Maybe it\u2019s just an urban\nmyth, but apparently Lara\u2019s most\nprominent features is the result of one\nof the developers playing around with\nthe character model, giggling at the\nresults and deciding to make that the\n\ufb01nal design of the character. Female\ncharacters in gaming were rife with\nperhaps derogatory stereotypes that\nprobably put many girls o\ufb00 gaming.\nIn the world of RPGs the male characters had the big swords (Freudian\nmaybe??) whilst the female characters\nwere weak and squishy casting spells\nsafe in the knowledge that the big,\nburly (if androgynous) men would\nprotect them.\nI\u2019d like to think that over the last\ndecade or so things have moved on\nsomewhat and yeah, to some extent,\nthey have. There is a decent repertoire\nof games out there that have realistic\nfemale characters that aren\u2019t de\ufb01ned\nby huge breasts, little clothing or\ntheir tendency to die easily. I\u2019m talking about Jade from Beyond Good and\nEvil, or Alyx from Half-Life 2. There\u2019s\nalso the development of games that\naren\u2019t just about killing crap or driving fast cars \u2013 things that stereotypi-cally, guys seem to enjoy more than\ngirls. My girlfriend \u2013 who before\nmeeting me had absolutely no interest\nin ever playing games \u2013 has recently\nfallen in love with Catherine, a puzzle\ngame about adultery and the consequences of it. The Wii has led to the\ndevelopment of games that appeal to\npeople who normally disregard them,\nopening it up to a wider audience.\nIt all boils down to the fundamental\nquestion I stated before: why should\nthe idea of sitting in front of a TV and\ncontrolling the actions of the characters on screen only appeal to men? I\ndon\u2019t get why it should.\nYet this still doesn\u2019t deal with a very\ndi\ufb00erent issue. Are girls welcomed as\ngamers? There are countless stories of\nwomen getting a hard time on online\nservices like Xbox Live. A game of\nCall of Duty with a bunch of drunken\nguys, when suddenly a girl appears on\nthe voice chat. Oh my god an actual\ngirl!! Then she has to su\ufb00er the entire\ngame getting hit on and abused by a\nbunch of idiots whilst all she wants to\ndo is shoot a few people like everyone\nelse there. Recently I went to the Eurogamer Expo like Ross, the Games\nEditor, who wrote about it a few\nweeks ago. It\u2019s my third expo and it\nseemed to me that this year had more\nfemale attendees than I\u2019d seen previ-ously. Women dressed up as videogame characters, groups of friends,\nboth male and female, and middle\naged couples all there to check out\nsome games. Maybe some of the girls\nwere dragged along by their partner\nor friendship group, but still perhaps\nit\u2019s a sign that attitudes to gaming are\nchanging. And then something hap-pened. Booth Babes. If you\u2019ve never\nheard of that term, it is infamously\nattached to gaming expos, describing\na woman paid to stand next a gaming\nbooth wearing very little. Her entire\npurpose is to lure men to come over\nto the booth and play the game she\nis advertising. Eurogamer has since\napologised for the signi\ufb01cant presence of booth babes this year, saying\nthey didn\u2019t know any of the companies attending had hired any and will\nnot let any companies do such next\nyear.\nNow I have nothing against women doing this for their profession.\nIt\u2019s more about how it labels the entire idea of computer games. \u201cVideo\ngames are for men. Men like scantily\nclad women. Hire women to advertise\ngames.\u201d Most of all it\u2019s a lazy and terrible advertising ploy. Moreover though\nit just tells every woman attending\nthese expos that they are not welcome\n\u2013 \u201cGirls, we don\u2019t give a shit if you like\ngames; we don\u2019t care if you came here\nto try out the Wii U or maybe play the\nnew Halo, this event is not for you.\nGo home and watch Sex and the City.\nThis place is for guys. Not just guys.\nStraight guys. Guys who like boobs\nand girls with QR codes on their hot\npants\u201d (yes they really did have QR\ncodes on their hot pants).\nTo be fair to the majority of the gaming industry, the main o\ufb00enders were\nnot really development companies.\nI\u2019m not going to name any names,\nbut only one game booth had booth\nbabes. Mostly it was supplementary\ncompanies. Companies that sell products involved in gaming, but not necessarily only for gaming. I think most\ndevelopers understand that girls can\nand do like games, and if they don\u2019t\nmake female characters that are absurd and sexist, girls might play them.\nMaybe I am just wrong. Maybe\nthere is something I\u2019m missing about\nwhy gaming is so male dominated;\nif so, let me know. However, regardless of that, the outward image needs\nto change. Purely from a marketing\npoint of view surely making over 50%\nof the population feel unwelcome in\nyour industry is a damn stupid tactic.\nT\nHERP DERP.

It\u2019s an odd feeling waking\nup so early knowing that you\u2019re going\nto spend an entire day exercising. Almost all of it will be uncomfortable (as\nin you\u2019d kind of like to do something\nelse instead) and a good chunk of it\nwill be really painful (as in you\u2019d really\nlike to be doing something else).\nThe race started at 7am, and I spent\nthe \ufb01nal 10 minute countdown in a\nnumb daze. Pretty much the sole focus\nof my life for half a year had been to\nget ready for that moment. The beach\nshelved quite sharply so within a couple of paces I was out of my depth.\nDon\u2019t be under any impression that I\u2019d\nstarted swimming though - there were\nfar too many people for that! The sea\nhad become a maelstrom of hands and\nlegs and it would have been crazy to\nput your head under water lest it be\nsmacked by a \ufb02ailing limb.\nAfter a couple of hundred metres\nthough, the \ufb01eld stretched out and I\ncould \ufb01nd my stroke. With 1500 other people around it feels like you\u2019re\nswimming downstream in a river, so\nthe two lap course seemed to \ufb02y by. I\nwas surprised to get out of the water\nin just over an hour - over 15 minutes\nquicker than I\u2019d ever managed in the\npool - and not really feeling any worse\nfor wear. 2.4 miles down, 138.2 to go\nand the warm glow of never having to\nswim again radiating through me.\nWe then had to run up the cli\ufb00 and\nthrough the town to our bikes which\nwere about 1km away. The noise was\nincredible. People were lining the\nstreet 2 or 3 deep on both sides of the\nroad and it seemed like all of them had\nSPORT\nSport Editors: Oli Benton,\nSorcha Cotter, Margot Pikovsky\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 19 OCTOBER\n46\nBecoming Ironman: Part 2\nSports Writer\nNed Yoxall\nlittle bells that they were ringing as\nloud as they could. You can say what\nyou like about the Welsh, but they do\nlove to see people doing silly things,\neven if it\u2019s early on a Sunday morning.\nThe cycle was a two lap course - one\nbig one of about seventy miles, and\nthen a smaller loop of part of that\ncourse to make up the rest of the dis-tance. Unfortunately, the only part\nof the course that was even a teensy\nbit \ufb02at was the bit that we only did\nonce. There was 2400m of ascent in\ntotal. Silver lining? 2400m of descent!\nThe miles passed by slowly, and I was\nmanaging to hold a fairly steady speed\nof 16 mph. Everything seemed to be\ngoing well, until the weather turned.\nFirst it started drizzling, and then it\nstarted chucking it down. Not only did\nthis drive many of the people that had\nbeen lining the route and doing such a\ngood job of shouting support/obsceni-ties at us inside, it also meant that we\nhad to really slow down on the de-scents. I passed quite a few people who\nhad come o\ufb00 on the winding roads\nand lost a lot of skin, or worse, broken\ntheir collarbones. It had turned from\na nice ride in beautiful countryside to\na grim and cold survival exercise. The\nsurvival element was ampli\ufb01ed by 3\npunctures in the last 20km (damn you\nthin race tyres) which left me shivering so violently that I couldn\u2019t keep my\nfront wheel straight.\nHaving lost a fair bit of time with\nall the tube changing fa\ufb00 I was keen\nto get on with the running so that I\u2019d\nbe able to get to the end and therefore\nnever have to exercise again. The run\ncourse was a 4 lap a\ufb00air, and consisted\nof about 4km up a big hill, 4km back\ndown it, and then another 2km wiggling around the streets of Tenby. You\nwere given a di\ufb00erent coloured band\non each lap to denote where you\u2019d\ngot to on the course. The band system might seem lovely to organisers,\nbut from a slow kid\u2019s (i.e. my) point of\nview, it was cruelty. When I was on my\n\ufb01rst lap, plenty of the quick kids had\ngot their last band. The envy was palpable as people in my position glared\nlongingly at the arms of those who\nwere further up the \ufb01eld.\nMy \ufb01rst lap went well, and I was\ncomfortably ticking over at just under\n8 minutes per mile. On the second lap\nthough, things nosedived and they\ndidn\u2019t recover. My stomach started\nto feel incredibly uncomfortable and\nwithin a couple of miles I had to dive\ninto the nearest portaloo. I thought\nthis might improve matters, but there\nwas no let up. Eating and drinking\nonly made things worse, so for the\nlast 30km or so of the run, no food or\ndrink passed my lips as I just couldn\u2019t\nkeep it down. By the third and fourth\nlaps, without going into too much\ndetail, my digestive system had completely shut down and it felt less like\nI was running a marathon than I was\ndesperately running from one porta-loo to the next. These last three hours\nof the race were the least comfortable\nof my entire life. It felt like my stomach was turning inside out, and I really\ncan\u2019t explain how I\u2019d ended up in that\nstate.\nSupport from the all sorts of sources\nwas really what kept me going. Short\nchats with other competitors, the\ncrowds in Tenby itself (especially outside the pubs as the night came in),\nseeing my family and friends - these\nwere all vital distractions from the\npain. I had expected pain, but not in\nthis form - I\u2019d imagined that my muscles would be screaming at me by this\nstage, but it really wasn\u2019t the case. All I\ncould do was keep trudging on knowing that each step brought me closer\nto the end. I\u2019d had my running gear\nprinted up with the CF Trust logo.\nThe real high point of every lap was\npassing a family who clearly had some\nconnection with the charity. They had\na little daughter who must\u2019ve been\n6 or 7, and every time I\u2019d come past\nshe\u2019d scream \u201ckeep going Mr. Cystic\nFibrosis!\u201d and, like so many of the kids\naround the course, put her hand out\nfor a sweaty high \ufb01ve. Their parents\nwould often thank you as if you\u2019d done\nthem a massive favour, not realising\nhow much of a bene\ufb01t it was providing us athletes as a distraction!\nBy the time I picked up the pink and\n\ufb01nal band, I was broken. Everything\nhurt, and taking into account portaloo\nbreaks my pace had dropped to well\nover 11 minutes per mile. At the \ufb01nishing line they have a big red carpet\nthat you run up and under an arch with\nenormous crowds lining the street. I\u2019d\nlike to have sucked up the atmosphere\nmore than I did, but I was in such a\ndaze that it seemed over in a \ufb02ash. As\nI came under the arch, I just managed\nto take in the commentator saying\n\u201cNed Yoxall, you are an Ironman!\u201d All\nof a sudden, it didn\u2019t seem like such a\nbig deal and if anything I was a little\nembarrassed by the American-style\nbrashness of it all. I managed to raise\nmy arms and smile as I \ufb01nished in 13\nhours and 46 minutes. I was quickly\nbustled into a holding pen where I\nwas plied with recovery drinks, given\nmy \ufb01nishers medal by the mayor and\nasked if I wanted to receive any medical attention. All I wanted was to be\nable to drink something after such\na long time without hydration, and I\ntentatively sipped the drinks I\u2019d been\ngiven. There was as much a feeling of\nrelief as there was of achievement.\nSo, was it all worth it? Well, from a\nsponsorship point of view, a resounding yes. I hope to raise a bit more\nthrough a video made from various\nfootage taken by my family and I on\nthe day. From a personal point of view,\nI\u2019m glad I\u2019ve done it. Would I do it\nagain? No. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I enjoy\nbeing \ufb01t and regular exercise, but the\namount of exercise required seriously\nrestricts the rest of your life. You can\u2019t\ndrink. You\u2019re often tired and grumpy.\nYou can\u2019t even spend weekends with\nyour partner because you\u2019re o\ufb00 on a\nlong bike ride/run and then you feel\nknackered when you get back. You\ndon\u2019t have any \ufb02exibility to make the\nmost of the other things in life, and\nunless your absolute passion in life\nis being as \ufb01t as you can, for me it\u2019s a\ntrade I was only willing to make for a\nshort time. There is a residual glow,\nthough, in the back of my mind.

    "content": "BUSINESS Business Editor: Deepka Rana\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 19 OCTOBER\n40\nSillicon Valley, South Ken\nSerge Vasylechko explores the startup ecosystem at Imperial\nwo weeks ago Imperial\nsaw the launch ICStartup - an initiative that\naims to inspire a new\ngeneration of student\nentrepreneurs. It will act\nas a central hub for entrepreneurial\nnews and events around college,\nconnecting an otherwise disparate\nand rich ecosystem of societies and\norganizations that cater to Imperial\u2019s entrepreneurial talent. At the\ncore of the new framework lies an\naccelerator programme, ICStartup+,\nwhich will give students a chance\nto turn their ideas into successful\nstartups by providing support from\nexperienced entrepreneurs, financial backing and access to a newly\nrefurbished office space, secretly\nhidden in the upper floors of Beit.\nContrary to the common percep-tion, Imperial has an extensive network of organizations that spawn\nthe field of enterpreneurship, which\ncould easily rival those of any UK\nor European university. Perhaps the\nmost prominent one is Imperial Innovations - a technology transfer\nand investment company that com-mercialises academic research at\nImperial. To date, it has generated\nan impressive portfolio of around\n70 high-tech startups that cover\nalmost every science, engineering\nand healthcare discipline taught at\nImperial. Last year, Imperial Innovations created an accelerator pro-gramme, called IDEA, that provided\nstudents with free mentorship and\nfinancial support for web and mobile businesses. In just 9 months, the\nprogramme has worked with over 15\nstudent startups, many of which begun from an idea on a single sheet of\npaper and have consequently grown\ninto early stage ventures. The initiative now forms part of Startup+ accelerator that has expanded to focus\nbeyond just web and mobile appli-cations, but also other sectors. Any\nstudent with an idea or who would\nlike to meet other likeminded people can simply drop in to the workshops and start building a business\naround their College work.\nYet if you have a strong affinity to startups that bring a\nreal change - social entrepreneurship may\nbe something worth exploring. The\nconcept has gained a lot of recent\npopularity and is praised by govern-ments, private corporations as well\nas social activists as a new type of\nbusiness altogether. Whilst still being for-profit, these businesses place\nthe importance of social rather than\nmonetary profits at the very core of\ntheir business model. In essence,\ntheir success is measured by social\nchange. A notable sector for social\nentrepreneurship is micro-finance,\nwhere special banks are setup to\ngive out loans to the poor at very\nlow or no interest rates. Other examples include businesses that aspire to transform education, healthcare or environment. Imperial Hub,\na branch of Student Hubs, is an organization that encourages student\nsocial entrepreneurship here on\ncampus. So if you have a new social\nbusiness idea, you could apply to\nthe programme and be offered up\nto \u00a315,000 in funding with a tailored\nmentorship programme alongside it\nto help your business grow.\nFor those students who want to\ntry a route with more rigorous sup-port, IED programme offers a great\nopportunity to work in a multidisciplinary and experienced\nteam. Developed by the Business\nSchool\u2019s Entrepreneurship Hub,\na year-long programme brings\ntogether Imperial\u2019s engineers,\nbusiness school MBAs and Royal College of Art designers to\nform startups that are\ncoached throughout\nthe year in the lead\nup to a \u00a310,000 investment compe-tition.\nStill, the variety of Imperial\u2019s\nstart-u p\necosystem doesn\u2019t end here. There\nare many student run societies\nwhich connect their members with\nnotable entrepreneurs and each\nother through networking sessions,\npresentations and competitions. Imperial Entrepreneurs is the largest\nsuch society which offers a range of\nchallenging weekend competitions,\nsuch as the Apprentice Challenge,\nI C\nHackathon\na n d\nStartup Weekend. The latter two in\nparticular let their participants run\nwild with ideas to generate and test\nbusiness concepts in less than 48\nhours. In November, there is also an\nannual entrepreneurship conference\nand a trip to Silicon Valley in April.\nOn top of that, there is a weekly\n\u201cStartup Mondays\u201d feature informal\ntalks by London\u2019s hottest startups\nfollowed by relaxed socials at Eastside Bar.\nFurthermore, if that seems not\nenough, you will find that Imperial\nCollege Business School has a range\nof its own interesting clubs, such as\nEntrepreneurs Interactive, which\nhost a series of thematically driven\nspeaker presentations, and Private\nEquity and Venture Capital Club\nthat focuses on the advanced topic\nof raising money from VCs. In\nfact, if you are interested in the\nlatter, you\u2019ll find that Andreas\nAngelopoulos\u2019 guest lectures\nseries are simply invaluable for an in depth understanding of this in-dustry. At the same\ntime, a number\nof newer clubs\nhave sprung\nup at Imperial that\nc o n -c e n -trate on sector specific issues. For\nexample, OBR network, previously\nknown as Oxford Biotechnology\nRoundtable, has been tremendously\nsuccessful with generation of multiple leads for students interested\nin innovation within biotechnology\nsector. As a result of this we now\nhave Marblar - a startup that was\njointly co-founded by students from\nOxford and Imperial. Also part of\nthe ICStartup+ accelerator, it has\nrecently been featured in all major\ntech publications around the world\nsuch as Wired magazine, Scientific\nAmerican, MIT Tech Review and\nNew Scientist.\nThe latest newcomer join the\nICStartup community is Mobile\nTechnology Club. Born somewhere\nin EEE department last year, its focus is on workshops and real world\nprojects for keen mobile app devel-opers. Of course, we are yet to see\nwhat this will yield. Yet, with support from ICStartup as the connecting puzzle, I think the club is likely\nto bring a few success stories to our\nmini version of the valley here quite\nsoon.\nT\nIf you would like to keep\nup-to-date with Imperial\u2019s\nstartup community, or simply want to find out more\nabout which events, competitions or help is available\n\u2013 please visit:\nwww.icstartup.com.\n\n"

    "content": "The White Horse\nIn the northern corner of Parson\u2019s\nGreen stands the long established\nFulham favourite, The White Horse.\nKnown for its unpretentious seasonal\nmenus, extensive drinks selection\nand reasonable prices. Its location\nmakes this restaurant perfect for the\nlarge proportion of Imperial Students\nwho live in or very close to Fulham.\nThere are two main eating areas, the\nupstairs, in which you feel as though\nNelson could have plotted his defeat\nof the French over a cheeky pint, the\nsecond (and my favourite), the downstairs conservatory, which has an intimate feel, with candles set into the\nexposed brick walls.\nI\u2019ll start with the food, which is superb and excellent value for money,\nThe White Horse o\ufb00ers a typical gas-tro pub menu, and is regularly changed\nto suit what\u2019s in season, from game to\nseasonal vegetables with the specials\nboard updated even more frequently.\nMy favourite dish over summer was\nthe Seared Duck\u2019s Breast Salad (\u00a312).\nThe breast was perfectly cooked,\ncrispy on the outside with a pink, tender centre and was accompanied by a\ndelicious salad of green beans, grilled\nfeta cheese, dressed mixed leaves, baby\nnew potatoes, sweet plum tomatoes\nand beetroot. The saltiness of the feta\nreally complemented the sweetness of\nthe beetroot, tomatoes and balsamic\ndressing. But don\u2019t worry, this isn\u2019t a\nplace known for its poncy, complicated salads: a favourite of my boyfriend\nis the hearty portion of classic British \ufb01sh and chips, served with fresh\nmushy peas and hollandaise sauce\n(\u00a311), you de\ufb01nitely get your money\u2019s\nworth with this dish. I can also recommend the lamb shank and the sea bass\n(but some dishes are meant for paying parents to treat the hardworking\nsons or daughters to!). The puddings\nalso come in decent portions, enough\nfor two to share, and the cheese board\n(including some excellently chosen\ncheeses) could easily be stretched to\nthree. Personally I cannot resist the\nChocolate, Almond Torte (\u00a35) when\nit\u2019s on the menu. It is a classic example\nof a beautifully balanced, bitter, sweet\npudding, and is complimented by\nthick cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, the texture of the\ntorte made more interesting by the use\nof ground almonds instead of \ufb02our.\nAt The White Horse there is no\ndrinks menu, instead they have an A4\ndrinks book. Being, what feels like, the\nonly person at Imperial who doesn\u2019t\ndrink beer, I cannot personally vouch\nfor The White Horse\u2019s renowned beer\nand ale selection (from \u00a32.80 a pint),\nbut I have it on good authority that it\nis fantastic. The ever helpful waiters\nand waitresses will happily help you\ntailor your drink to your meal (The\nWhite Horse also hold regular beer\nand food matching lessons). However I can tell you more about the\namazing wine selection, as a student\ntheir cheapest wine (at \u00a33.70 a glass)\nis excellent value, very drinkable and\na perfect accompaniment to the red\nmeat dishes (and the duck salad!). At\nthe White Horse there is no concept\nof a cheap, bland, acidic \u2018house\u2019 wine.\nHaving taken a complete wine bu\ufb00 on\na couple of occasions, I\u2019m pretty sure\nyou won\u2019t be disappointed with the\nselection.\nFor me The White Horse is the perfect place both for a romantic meal or\na relaxed dinner with friends, I\u2019ve never come away feeling disappointed,\nneither with the food nor the prices!\nThe atmosphere fuels conversation,\nand even if you\u2019re talked out, you can\nalways resort to people watching: The\nWhite Horse is normally full of \u2018Tarquins\u2019!\nElizabeth Crow\nFOOD\nYiango\u2019s Coconut Cake\nIngredients\n1 cup \ufb02our\n1 cup semolina\n1 cup sugar\n1 cup coconut\n1 cup milk\n6 tbsp ground \ufb02ax seed 1 1/5 cup water\n3 tsp baking powder 1/6 cup vanilla extract 1 cup oil\nFor the syrup:\n1 cup sugar\n1 cup water\n1\u20442 tsp lemon\nProcedure\nLightly grease a 9-inch cake pan and\npreheat the oven at 180 degrees.\nMake the syrup by boiling the sugar\nand water for about 7-8 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the lemon\nand let it cool.\nIn a cup mix the \ufb02axseed with the\nwater and set aside.

It\u2019s not just Aston \u2013 luxury\nbrands seem steadfast on cheapening their image at the moment; think of\nthe Ferrari Store on Regent\u2019s street, all those luxury brand high street collaborations (Karl Lagerfeld and H&M, etc.). And, here\u2019s the seamless link,\nHeston Blumenthal with his ready meal collection at Waitrose. For around a\nfiver, you can buy his version of shepherd\u2019s pie, chilli con carne, and prawn\ncocktail, which differ from other versions of the same dishes by, well, err, not\nmuch really except for the nicer packaging.\nHeston Blumenthal is a brilliant, brilliant chef. His one-star Michelin res-taurant, Dinner, is superb. His Meat Fruit starter is at the same time fun,\ndifferent, delicious and memorable. The Broth of Lamb with Slow Cooked\nHen\u2019s Egg divine, rich, with layers of flavour that surprise you with delight as\neach new one unfolds. He even makes chicken an interesting dish to eat, so\ntender you could eat it with a spoon. His Tipsy Cake is hearty, wonderfully\nsweet and nostalgic. There\u2019s even the \u00e9lan of having your ice-cream made at\nthe table with liquid nitrogen. This really is fantastic food. And for not much\nmore than a meal at more buzzing but far less delicious joints like Le Caprice,\nBoisdale, and Daphnes \u2013 per head, with wine, you can have three courses for\naround \u00a380. The set-lunch menu is \u00a336 for three courses \u2013 an absolute steal.\nThis simply makes Heston\u2019s descent to pre-packed, just-pierce-the-trans-parent-film-and-heat-in-the-microwave-for-4-minutes hell all the more disappointing and shameful. Dinner by Heston is stupendous, like an Aston\nMartin DB5, something that blurs the lines between practicality and art. But\njust as much as Bond doesn\u2019t belong in a Cygnet, Heston Blumenthal dishes\ndo not belong on neon-lit supermarket shelves next to the Chinese meal box\nfor four.

    "content": "Flicks on bricks\nAn evening of cutting edge video art\nLast week from October 11th to 14th,\nthe Bargehouse of Oxo Tower Wharf\nhosted the annual Moving Image fair,\nLondon\u2019s only fair solely dedicated\nto moving image and contemporary\nvideo art. This meant four \ufb02oors celebrating the video installations, projections and other forms of moving\npictures of 35 artists from 15 di\ufb00erent countries. With the easy access to\ndigital technologies, video art is a still\no\ufb00beat yet increasingly popular form\nof art \u2013 which should not be confused\nwith experimental \ufb01lm!\nOne of the main events held as part\nof the Moving Image fair was the second session of Bring Your Own Beamer (BYOB), a presentation held on the\nopening night and organized by Clare\nHolden and Jo\u00e3o Laia. For this event,\na mix of over 39 pieces was displayed\nin the attic of the Bargehouse; an opportunity opened to any interested\nvideo artists ready to bring their own\nmaterials, collaborate to set up an impromptu display and showcase their\nmoving image performance for a free\none-night exhibition.\nBeing appreciative yet not tremendously zealous for contemporary art,\nmy expectations were to \ufb01nd a pell-mell of lights and sounds \u2013 even just a\ncacophony \u2013 because of the spontaneous way artists have to set up for the\nevent. Yet I was surprised to \ufb01nd that\neverything ran quite e\ufb00ortlessly well\ntogether, as if it had been a long time\nplanned. But in fact, artists had to\nturn up just a few hours ahead of the\nevent, to set up anywhere in space of\nthe attic, using any of its walls, \ufb02oors,\nor ceiling. While there was a lot going\non, it was far from being overwhelm-ing; even feeling somehow more natural than our usual gallery spaces where\nhushes and stillness are almost de facto characteristics.\nGrowing from last year\u2019s event,\nwhich brought together 8 artists, the\npresentation boasted a huge variety of\npieces. That is one of the main points\nof interest in video art: the diversity\nof end results that can be delivered\nby playing with the several dimensions movement give to static 2-D\nimages. While some installations focus on content or storyline, others\ncentre on the delivery methods and\nthe tricks video art is able to play on\nthe audience. Some pieces were humoristic and veered towards a farcical approach: Charli Clark\u2019s Moles\nUnderground depicting a trio dressed\nup as moles exploring London\u2019s undergound was most entertaining yet\nclearly highlighted the unnatural environment of the Tube. Other pieces\nEmilie Beauchamp\nARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n27\nFRIDAY 19 OCTOBER\nwere purely contemplative, such as\nOlga Koroleva\u2019s purist play with milk\nbottles and Carole Villain\u2019s aesthetic\nStanding Pythia.\nThere is no particular theme to\nBYOB, except one of giving the chance\nto artists to expose their work. The\nBYOB concept \ufb01rst emerged in New\nYork in 2010 but has by now spread\nto more than 45 cities in the world\nto gather momentum in video artist\ncommunities. In fact I\u2019ve learned that\ncontemporary video art often \ufb01nds\nit logistically and commercially hard\nto present pieces \u2013 mostly because\nof the space requirements. Unable to\npigeon-hole video art because of the\nrange of topics and styles it includes,\nthe objective of the movement doesn\u2019t\n\ufb01t with society\u2019s traditional focus on\npurely contemplative art or highly\ninformative expositions. It\u2019s a shame,\nbecause video art might just be the\nbest way to express, communicate and\nprovoke in the fast-paced and overloaded 21st century. For those who\nmissed last week\u2019s event, take note that\nthe Moving Image fair will be coming\nback next year around this time. In the\nmeantime, you can track on Film London Artists\u2019 Moving Image Network\n(www.\ufb02amin.\ufb01lmlondon.org.uk) or\nLUX\u2019s (www.lux.org.uk) websites for\nthe latest video art exhibitions and\nevents around in London.\nThe current exhibition at the Royal\nFestival Hall at the Southbank Centre\nconsists of paintings, poetry, sculp-tures, textiles, and videos by o\ufb00enders, secure patients, and detainees.\nThe fact that this is the premise for\nthe exhibition makes it an interesting\none, as it inevitably leads to a strong\nfocus on the psyche behind the artwork coming from an individual removed from the mainstream of society and how they decide to express\nthis distance. You can\u2019t help but have\nexpectations before arriving, and it\nis worth going to see whether or not\nthey are met.\nWhat was surprising was how\nskilled many of the artists were. It\ncame as a surprise because not only\nwere all pieces done by amateurs, but\nthe stereotypical preoccupations of\nan o\ufb00ender can sometimes negate\nthis expectation.\nConvicts in the frame: from gaol to gallery\nLily Le Most of the artwork is not abstract,\nmeaning it is easier to interpret the\nintentions behind it.\nIndeed, many of the pieces centre\non the frustrations of being detained\nand the longing for freedom; being\nostracised by society and removed\nfrom daily pleasures. One striking\npainting depicted the public haranguing of an o\ufb00ender by personi\ufb01ed foxes, wolves, and other beasts\nin a dark and dirty land. Its pop surrealism style takes the serious edge\no\ufb00 the piece and makes it to be more\no\ufb00hand.\nBizarrely, there are also many\npaintings of Bob Marley by several\ndi\ufb00erent artists.\nVideos ranging from o\ufb00enders\nworking out in a prison gym and a\ncartoon about Scotland with poetic\nnarration are also part of the exhibi-tion. Audio works are present, such\nas spoken-word poems and a choir-chimed Stand By Me.\nAn insight into the display is given\nby a video where Sarah Lucas (the\ncurator) explains how she enjoys the\nraw nature of many of the pieces. She\nstates that the toilet bowls used as\npainting stands were not brought in\nespecially for the free exhibition, al-though, ironically, they do pair well.\nLucas also explains that she uses concrete blocks to display the sculptures,\nan e\ufb00ect which many probably would\nnot notice or appreciate had attention not been drawn to them.\nShe also comments on a painting\nof Queen Liz in aviator sunglasses,\nwhich is quite rightly amusing.\nThe pieces were entered into the\nKoestler Awards, for which winners\nwon small cash prizes. Artists with\na substantial body of work receive\na year\u2019s mentoring from a Koestler\nmentor. These projects are a way of\nallowing o\ufb00enders to focus on education and can be therapeutic for patients in psychiatric hospitals.\nFree at Southbank Centre, until 25 November. Entrance is free.\nTweezer shortage affects Wayne Rooney\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 19 OCTOBER\n8\n\u2018m not here to tell you how to\nmake notes or to advise you\non exam technique. The following are a few dirty tricks\nthat I\u2019ve learnt though my\nyears at Imperial. I\u2019m a physicist so\nthat\u2019s what I\u2019ve written about, but\nmaybe you can transfer some of this\nto your own course \u2013 unless it\u2019s geol-ogy, I have no tips on colouring-in.\nThe \ufb01rst thing to remember is\nall you leave here with is a grade. It\ndoesn\u2019t matter that you picked the\nhardest subjects or that your supervisor messed you around. The outside\nworld doesn\u2019t care. All they see is: 1st\n\u2013 clever (might be an arse), 2:1 \u2013 did\nalright, probably well rounded, 2:2 \u2013\ntoo much sport, 3rd or below \u2013 expensive toilet paper. These grades are\nawarded with huge boundaries and\neven if you miss one by a few percent\nyou will still get an interview to bring\nyou up.\nThis makes the undergrad obsession with getting every last mark\nfrankly ridiculous. Don\u2019t get me\nwrong, the mid-morning panic before an assessed problem sheet deadline is quite amusing, but it won\u2019t\nmake a di\ufb00erence to your grade.\nA problem sheet is worthless and\none mark is 0.017 times that. The aim\nof your \ufb01rst year is to learn how to\nlearn. Don\u2019t waste hours minus sign\nhunting when you could be grasping\nconcepts (or enjoying yourself). If\nyou care that much, just cheat.\nStudents are the best teachers so\ntalk to your peers. You don\u2019t get any\nmarks for deriving the whole of physics by yourself. For me, half the time I\nwas stuck it was just a mistake in the\nlecture notes.\nIf you\u2019re looking for people to work\nwith, ignore the front row. They\u2019re\nnot clever, they just need people to\nthink they are. The clever kid is sitting on their own, quietly con\ufb01dent\nand de\ufb01nitely not stopping the lecture every \ufb01ve minutes to ask yet another inane question.\nStand up for yourself, particularly\nwith demonstrators. These are generally young PhD students with little\nmarking experience a.k.a easy pick-ings. After each lab report you will\nhave a feedback session where they\npoint out the reasons you\u2019ve been\nmarked down. Your job is to listen\nvery carefully and wait for them to\nslip up. Perhaps they said you left\nsomething out or that you made an\nerror in your maths. Are they right?\nIf not you should very politely point\nit out.\nDon\u2019t spend your time sitting in\nfront of books because you\u2019re too\nguilty to go out but not working because you\u2019re too bored to pick up a\n\u201cThe clever kid is sitting on their own, quietly confident and definitely not stopping the lecture every five minutes.\u201d\nHow to get a first: a blagger\u2019s guide\nThe Old Man offers some wise words to new students\npen. Work when you mean to work\nand play when you mean to play. If\nyou don\u2019t have an interest outside\nyour studies you\u2019ll burn out or at the\nvery least have a miserable time.\nGo to tutorials, if you\u2019re wavering\non a grade boundary the backing of\nyour tutor will count for a lot more\nthan those extra assessed problem\nsheet marks.\nThis one might be a bit contro-versial, but, personally, I don\u2019t think\nthere\u2019s much value in \ufb01guring out\nproblem sheets from scratch. Exams\nare about reproducing mathematical\ntricks, so I generally waited for the\nanswers before attempting any.\nCourses\nChoice of courses is paramount, get\nit right and it can easily earn you a\ngrade. First and foremost choose\ncourses based on who\u2019s lecturing.\nGet a du\ufb00 lecturer with bad notes\nand you\u2019ll be up a popular creek\nwithout a paddle. There are some lecturers who require students to think\nduring exams \u2013 these sadists should\nbe avoided at all costs. Fortunately\nthere are others that perennially set\neasy papers. Find out who these wonderful people are and make your life\na bit easier.\nIt is of course deeply unfair that\nthe (in)competence of the lecturer\nshould have a greater impact on your\ngrade than your own (in)competence.\nYou might naively expect that some\ncentral system would sort this out.\nAnd it\u2019s true such a system does exist,\nhowever, in practice, I\u2019ve never seen\nit work, and the same lecturers give\nhigh marks year after year.\nAfter second year there are no compulsory courses (in Physics), so this is\nthe point where assumed knowledge\nstops. Yet lots of courses require the\nsame background, which must be\ntaught in each course. This means\nthere\u2019s room for the astute student to\neconomise their learning by maxim-ising the overlap between subjects.\nIn Physics, for example, General\nRelativity, Quantum Field Theory\nand Uni\ufb01cation all require a good\ngrasp of Einsteinian notation. Do\nall three and you get taught it three\ntimes, have three times the practice\nand get three times the marks, but\nonly have to learn it once.\nSome of the conceptually harder\ncourses can be a good way to go.\nQuantum Information might seem\nlike a lot to get your head around.\nHowever, once you get there you\ncan almost guarantee a high mark\n(~90%). Get a few of these under your\nbelt and it can really take the strain\no\ufb00 your average\nI\nWhat if you\u2019re stuck?\nIt\u2019s important to recognise when\nyou\u2019re completely lost. Courses generally build on themselves, so when\nthis happens it\u2019s probably because\nyou\u2019ve missed something early on.\nForget about keeping up with the\ncourse and go back to the start, it\u2019s\nmuch more important to understand\nthe basics.\nIf you can phrase your question go\nto o\ufb03ce hours, they\u2019re a massively\nunder used resource. Talk to your\npeers.\nIf all that fails remember no explanation is ever perfect. Whether\nit\u2019s textbooks or lecture notes they\nall inevitably miss out something. If\nyou use more than one of these the\nchances are they won\u2019t both have\nmissed the same thing.\nRevision\nStart early, the Easter Holiday has a\nmisleading title and even this might\nbe cutting it a bit \ufb01ne. Get a timetable\nand stick to it. It\u2019s better to learn half\nof all of your courses than all of half\nof them. Stop playing sports, become\na recluse and for God sake don\u2019t do 24\nhour musical or any other nonsense\nthat gets in the way of your exams.\nFinally\nYou\u2019re not at school anymore. If you\nfail the only person that looks bad is\nyou. Lecturers, tutors and demonstrators are too busy with their own\nresearch to drag you through your\ndegree. You are the master of your\nown destiny, you can fail spectacularly and no one will blink an eye. You\nmight not like it but \u201cresearch reigns,\nstudents are pains\u201d \u2013 even when\nthey\u2019re paying \u00a39,000 a year.\n\n"
