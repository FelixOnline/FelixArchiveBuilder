    "content": "IREVIEWSI\nSteven Berkoff demonstrating his potential in\nMarlowe (picking teeth) and a sofa (reclining)\nDecadent Class?\nDecadence written and directed by\nSteven Berkoff, Arts Theatre.\nSteven Berkoff's play Decadence is a merciless onslaught on the English ruling or\nupper classes, \"so called by virtue of\nstrangulated vowel tones rather than any real\nachievement.\" Mr Berkoff has written many\nother plays for The London Theatre Group\nwhich he formed in 1972. Among these are\nMetamorphosis and The Trial (after Kafka),\nMacbeth, Hamlet, Miss Julie (after Strindberg)\nThe Fall of the House of Usher, Agamemnon\n(after /Eschylus) and Creek and Decadence\nwhich have toured the world to critical\nacclaim. He has also appeared in many films\nand is co-starring in Roger Moore's latest Bond\nfilm to be rehearsed in June.\nDecadence has a cast of two: the writer\nhimself and Linda Marlowe, a founder member\nand co-writer of the original \"Sadista Sisters\"\nrock group, with many TV appearances to her\ncredit. According to my press notices, Mr\nBerkoff has for ten years \"been mounting a scathing assault on English Society.\" And\nDecadence, judging my the finished product,\nmust be Berkoff's last desperate measure, the\nace up the sleeve, the weapon to end all\nweapons, the spectacularly bloody revenge,\nbecause Decadence is desperate and totally\nuncompromising. There is no plot as such. Mr\nBerkoff and Ms Marlowe play two upper class\nadulterers but we are treated to a positive but\nhumerous cry of exaggeration. The two blue\nstockings seem to be in perpetual orbit around\nsex, gluttony, alcohol, sex, boredom, childish\ngames and more sex. The caricatures\nportrayed are monstrously exaggerated. It is\nGargantua and Pantagruel gone mad (with\nMonsieur Rabelais turning in his grave).\nBerkoff assembles the whole range of\nstereotypes into one person, but it is not so\nmuch what he says that is funny (he's not very\nDecadence (or is he just boasting?). Linda\ncomplete the scene.\ngood at doing posh accents) but his physical\nmannerisms and gymnastics on stage. He is\nsuperb at mime \u2014 he is Parisien trained \u2014 and\nas the evening wears on the acrobatics\nbecome more and more energetic. If nothing\nelse, his part is a physical tour de force.\nAlthough we 'see' the couple at an\nexpensive restaurant, the opera and other\nhaunts of the 'idle rich' the stage is adorned\nthroughout with no more than a sofa and a tulip in a vase. But Mr Berkoff does the most\nstrange things with the sofa. The most strange\nthings indeed. Mr Berkoff fondles it, he makes\nlove on it, he makes love to it, he tells rude\nstories on it, he throws up on it, he empties his\nbowels on it and clambers around on it like an\norang-u tang in a cage. This is decadence of the\nmost animal kind, and this is Mr Berkoff' idea\nof upper class behaviour, what all the Lords\nand Ladies in the land are doing. All the Lords\nand Ladies? Does Lord Flowers indulge in this\nkind of thing? Of course not. Then what is Mr\nBerkoff trying to say? I don't know. If it is a generalisation then few people will be fooled.\nAll generalisations are dangerous and this is\none of them. Of course, most of us are guilty of\nmaking them from time to time, and people are\nalso making them of us. In East Germany the\nauthorities issue lists of approved terms for the\npopular press to use when describing other\nnationalities. The officially approved terms for\nthe British run as follows: paralytic syco-phant s, effete betray or s of humanity, carrion\neating servile imitators, arch cowards and\ncollaborators, gang of women murderers,\ndegenerate rabble, parasitic traditionalists,\nplayboy soldiers and f conceited dandies.\nSounds familiar?\nThe social comment there is in Decadence\nis rather snowed under by the gross\ncharacter is ation. Be that as it may, the\nproduction is still funny, rather shocking (and\noften downright vulgar\u2014keep granny well\naway) and although it is not the sort of thing\nthat would have universal appeal, there are\nbound to be some who think highly of it.\nNick Bedding\nContinued from previous page\nis not without hope. This mud is the essence of\nlife, the all pervading medium of our everyday\nexistance.\nThe photography is attractive with the black\nand white washed out look capturing the\nsomewhat mournful mood of the picture. The\nuse of standard rather than any of the scope\nformats is unusual but effective. I have long felt\nthat 'scope's wide screen is a drawback, as it\ndisperses the attention of the viewer with vital\nthings happening in the periphery of vision.\nObviously it is harder for the Director to cram\ninto the frame all he wants without losing it in\nthe distance, but it is often worth the effort.\nMinoru Sakurai turns in a fine performance\nas Kuchi, the self reliant outcast, and Takahiro\nTamura, Nobuo's father plays the part of the\nwistful, bitter war veteran with great pre sc en ce However, Nobuo him se: his mother are\n\u2022somewhat embarrass nt \u2022 i u....'h and the film\nseemed to drag a bit in pi aces. Whether it was\nthe well-upholstered chairs of the Bijou\nTheatre or too many after film booze ups that\ncaused resonant snoring to echo from one part\nof the cinema after an hour or so is open to\nquestion.\nMuddy River is playing in a double bill with\nThe Spirit of the Beehive, a Spanish film about\na girl who believes in Frankenstein's monster.\nAltogether a very interesting double bill, but,\nrunning for nearly three hours, it is only for the\ntrue a ff ici an a do.

This does not commit\nyour parents to actually paying\nyou for six years, it is merely a legal requirement of covenants\nthat they must be capable of\nexceeding six years. After each\npayment you get a form from the\ntax office, fill it in and return it\nto your tax office and they wil\nthen refund you the basic rate\ntax that your parents have\nalready paid on the money u that\nyou receive under the covenant.\nDo not be put off if it sounds\ncomplicated and legalistic \u2014 we\nhave a simple deed of covenant\nyou can copy out and once\nsigned covenants are very simple\nto administer as the hundreds of\nstudents who have already\nbenefited from them can vouch.\nPage2| \u2022January 21, 19631\nPoints to note\n1. To benefit from a covenant\nyou must be over 18 or married.\n2. Your parents must be paying\ntax and you not paying tax.\n3. The amount covenanted \u2014 ie\nwhat you get from your parents\nplus what you get from the\ntaxman \u2014 counts as your earned\nincome. This means that if the\nmoney you receive under the\ncovenant plus any other income\nyou have during the year such as\nvacation earnings exceeds your\nPersonal Tax Allowance (\u00a31565\nfor single people) then you will\nhave to start paying tax on the\nexcess. This position has been\nfurther complicated this year by\nthe taxing of some social security\nbenefits so it is wise to do your\nsums first. The Student Services\nOffice can help you with this.\n4. Covenants can be drawn up at\nany time of the year and at any\npoint in the student's course, but\nfor maximum benefit the earlier\nthe better.\n5. The covenant can be cancelled\nby mutual consent at any time.\nWant to know more?\nCall into the Student Services\nOffice, 15 Princes Gardens, any\ntime between 9.30am and 6pm and we can give you a fact-sheet\nwith all the details you need to\nknow.\nmmm mmm mmm t felix "

    "content": "sPORT\nfa) Tennis\nLast Tuesday saw a, not as\nstrong (or fit) as it could be, first\nteam score a vital victory in the\nwinter league held under floodlights in North London. Four\nenthusiastic IC lads braved\nFrench style driving, slippery\ncourts, bad lighting and severe\nweather conditions to score a15 points to 6 victory over the excellent London club, Drive.\nThere were problems of course\nboth on the court, such as\nChristian's volleys and Rob's forehand, and off it where John\nSear almost turned himself\ninside out in the changing rooms\nbut said he felt 10 pounds lighter\nafter the experience. The out-' come was made certain when\nDave Gladman and John Sear\nstole their match from the\nopposition's second pair, after\nbeing 6-2, 5-4 down, to win 2-6,\n7-5, 9-7. The full result was:\nC. Langerin and R. Easton won\n6-2, 6-4 and 6-3, 6-4\nJ. Sear and D. Gladman won 2-6, 7-5, 9-7 and lost 4-6, 6-4, 6-0\nMan of the match: D. Gladman.\nWorst performance: the opposition and R. Easton. Special\nthanks to Judith Taylor. Next\nmatch: Friday 21 January.\nSquash\nA quick summary of the midseason team positions and\npromotions,\nl sts Div 1 3rd,27 pts2 nds Div 3 2nd,34 pts( promoted)\n3rds Div 3 8th,16.5 pts4 th s Div 4 7th,19 pts5 th s Div 6 2nd,33 pts( promoted)\nThus the 5 mens teams are\nplaced in the top 5 divisions for\nround 2.\nThe ladies team is 3rd or 4th in Ladies Div 2 following some\nsound performances, especially\ntowards the end of last term.\nThe leader in the individual\ncup competition is Ian Grindall\nwho has yet to be beaten for the\n1st or 2nd teams.\nAs of Wednesday the post\nmatch peanut and cheese and\nonion crisp sessions began again.\nSee next weeks action packed\narticle for the outcomes. Details\nof trips to Germany and jerseys\nare on the notice board in the\nSports Centre for a change.\nVolleyball\nAn action packed episode this\nweek\u2014first an update. The mens\nteam continued their winning\nstreak in the SEE TECH league\nwith a32 victory over Tottenham College, a total erasure of\nHounslow V BC and ditto International University Watford (no\njoking folks, there is one!).\nTo crown all this last week-end, after an arduous 4 hour\nminivan trip involving paralysed\nglut io us maxim uses all round,\nLiverpool University exited from\nthe EVA National Students' Cup\nby 3 sets to 1. Another arduous\nvan trip back, more corns on the\nICVBC collective bum (???-Ed)\nand a puncture on the Ml rounded off a good day out.\ni1 Meanwhile the question of\nteam shirts has arisen and a decision is needed as to their\ncolour and shape (silver lame\nsleeveless vs pink frilly front and\nElizabethan collar on sequined\nmauve velvet), so there will be a Club General Meeting on Wed\n19 Jan at 13.30 in the Volleyball\nCourt to discuss this and other\nmatters. Red tape rules OK. To finish on an oft-repeated\nnote, the Ladies team is suffering\nfrom a lack of ladies so acute\nthat for the last two sessions'\nnone have shown up. As you can\nappreciate, this makes coaching\na trifle on the difficult side, and\nleaves me, Pete and Man wondering what to do on Tuesday\nevening. At this point in a Dickens novel the hero usually\ngives up and turns to drink, so if\nyou want us to stay Guniless,\nplease come along. All welcome\nTuesdays 17.30 to 19.30 at the\nVolleyball Court, 2nd floor Old\nChemistry Bldng.\nFinally a touching cri de\ncoeur. Any Greek speaking\nBarry Manilow addict wishing to\nestablish a meaningful relationship with volleyball ing fellow\nsufferer, contact C. Christou of\nElec Eng 1.\npreparing to land. Precise circles and ellipses\nmake contented geometric flowers; a violently\nstruggling squiggle metamorphoses into an\nacrobatic butterfly; and the night sky is filled\nwith the spots off a peacock's tail.\nExperience not to be missed\n'Tron' has a desperately weak story line and\nno plot. The film's appeal is totally visual - the\ngraphics are dazzling. In much the same way\nthe sound-track of Laserium is almost\nincidental, but the colours and images are\ndazzling.\nLASER is an acronym of Light Amplification\nby Stimulated Emmission of Radiation. Given\nthe right combination of modulators ,\noscillators and scanning controls you too\ncould produce a gyrating laser image. But, just\nas 'Tron' is the (current) ultimate in computer\ngraphics, the laser i um is worth a visit to see\nthe ultimate artistic exploitation of the\nprinciples of spatial and temporal coherence of\nphotons!\nWhere, when, \u00a3 ?\nThere are laser shows 5 days a week at the\nLondon Planetarium - next door to Madame\nTussaud's and the Baker Street tube station -at 6.00 and 7.30 on Sun, Wed, Thurs, Fri and\nSat, with an extra show at 9.00 on Friday and\nSaturday. Tickets cost \u00a31.25 with a student's card and can be booked up to 14 days in\nadvance, but no phone bookings.\nBehind the scenes, but larger than a Walkman\nCordon Bleugh\nIf you're just back in London after a Traditional\nFamily Christmas you're probably fed up to\nthe eyeballs with Festive Fare and yearning for.\nsomething light quick and tasty and easy to\ndigest. Some of you might be lucky enough to\nhave received a toasted sandwich machine, or\nif not, these recipes might persuade you to buy\none at the sales with some left over Christmas\nmoney. In all these recipes remember to\nspread a thin layer of butter or margarine on\nthe ol if side of the sandwich to prevent\nsticking.\nFirst of all, a variant of the tried and trusted\ncheese toastie. Spread both pieces of bread\nthickly with cold custard (tinned will do),\nkeeping it away from the edges to prevent\nleaking. Grate two ounces of cheddar cheese,\nand mix with a small amount of tomato sauce\nand some finely chopped dried dates. Pile the\nmixture in the middle of one slice, cover with\nthe other and toast.\nNext, the breakfast toastie. First, cover one\nslice of bread with a layer of cold porridge.\nSprinkle on chopped bacon or ham, sliced\nfried mushrooms and either boiled or fried\negg. (Boiled eggs will have to be chopped or\nsliced, fried eggs can be left whole and\ntrimmed to fit the bread being used). Spread\nthe second slice of bread with marmalade,\ncover the sandwich and toast.\nAnd finally, a special toastie with that certain\nje-ne-sais-quoi that typifies true cordon bleu gh cookery. To a small jar of pickled cockles, add\na finely chopped banana, a tablespoon of\nBovril and a tablespoon of white wine. Stir\nthoroughly. Drain, and spoon onto bread\nwhich has been spread with crunchy peanut\nbutter. Spread covers with peanut butter,\ncover and toast.\nFELIXI I January21,19831 I Page!\n\n"

    "content": "IREVIEWSI\nA FILM BY YILMAZ GUNEY\nTHE WAY\nYOL (15) a Yilmaz Guney film directed by\nSerif Goren, now showing exclusively at\nthe Lumiere Cinema, St. Martin's Lane.\nYOL may strike you as a bit of a daft name for\na film, sounding more like a Scandanavian\nnav vy than a Turkish word meaning 'the way'\n(a reference to a journey or route through life\nin this case). It turns out to be a surprisingly\nwell made film which shared the top award at\nCannes last year with Costa-Gavras' impressive Missing.\nYOL tells the story of five prisoners who are\ngiven a weeks parole from their island prison.\nThe film opens in the said institution, which is\nrather relaxed and not a bit like the home for\ndefeated cons shown in Alan Parker's Midnight Express. But their joy at release is\nsoon dampened by the harsh real it ie. of life in\nmodern day Turkey. Through a series of\nepisodes each prisoner's story is revealed with\nan ease which betrays the experience of the\nfilm's creator, Yilmaz Guney. This remarkable\nman has f pent mos i of the last 20 years in a Turkish prison, but has still managed to\nproduce a long list of films by virtually directing\nfrom his cell. Visitors showed him sketches\nand stills from the scenes and he even\nrt-hearse d ac.ors and edited from r: shes. He\nfinally escaped to Paris ir 1981 to edit VOL,\n?';er :;*\u2022:\u00ab\u2022 hope in eve: having f tv edom in\nTurkey.\nOne of the prisoners travels to Kurdistan\nwhere rebels continually raid from nearby\nSyria. His fat is soon decided for him by a combination, c external forte1 and he does\nnot return to nis jail.\nAnother ;t face trie reality of his crime\nand admit he was responsible for the death of\nhis brother-in-law. This leads to him regaining\nhis estr n no ei.1 wife, but with tragic consequences\nThe nic t!r romp'ate story is that of Seyit,\nwhich dominates t ne latter halt ot the film and\nis genuinely moving. He returns home to\nJiscovcr that his wife has committed a; un forgive able crime and must, by tradition, die\nat his hands. To do this he travels to the\nisolated mountain village in north-east Turkey\nwhere her family have imprisoned her, chained\nand unwashed, for eight months. Torn\nbetween rage and pity he finds himself\nsuspended between ancient customs and\nhuman compassion.\nAll of these scenes blend together to give a powerful and ironic message; each man finds\nhimself imprisoned just a much in the outside\nworld, trapped between outdated customs and\nrestrictive authorities. We also see a range of\nbreathtaking images of Turkey, from crowded\ncities to snow covered mountains, all used to\nquite stunning effect.\nSo overall YOL is a pleasant surprise which,\ndespite its tragic story, remains inspirational\nrather than depressing. It kept my full\nattention throughout and is recommended as a very interesting and entertaining picture.\nMark Smith\nSeyit bids a tearful farewell to his son in YOL,\nbut his return to the island prison is left in\ndoubt.\nI Fr\nom left\nFEu x a a Nobuo and Kiichi (a new Triple act to rival the Marx Brothers)\ni January21,19831 Still Waters\nMuddy River, directed by Kohei Ozuri,\nJapenese dialogue, English subtitles. Now\nshowing at the Paris Pullman.\nIf your only experience of Japan is watching\nShogun on the telly, then your view of Japan\nmay well be that it was all wooden-and-paper\nhouses, picturesque gardens and sullen\nsamurai until someone invented the microchip and the economy car, when overnight it\nwas transformed into teeming cities and\ngleaming office blocks.\nThis film is set between these two\nperiods\u2014in 1956, after our transatlantic\ncousins had spent a few years setting fire to\nevery wooden-and-paper city they could lay\ntheir hands on and before they started buying\nevery Datsun and electronic gadget they\ncould.\nWhat we see is a desolate landscape with a poor country struggling to rebuild itself after\ndefeat, humiliation and devastation. The war is\nstill a fresh wound in the minds of the men who\nvividly remember their fallen comrades, and\nmany wish they had fallen in battle with their\nsamurai pride in tact, rather than suffer the\ndegradation of trying to scrape a living in a time of peace.\nBut this film is not about war or the old\nwarriors. It is about a friendship between two\nnine year old boys. The Muddy River of the\ntitle is an allegory. Nobuo's parents own a restaurant on a river. Kuchi lives on a boat\nwith his mother and sister, which one day ties\nup on the opposite bank of the river.\nThe Muddy River also stands for the 'River\nof Life'. At its source, birth, it is clean and\npure. But, as it is sullied by its environment, it\nwidens, flows slower and the issues are no\nlonger clear but cloudy. There are no rights or\nwrongs, there are just grey areas. Yet the film\nContinued on next page\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 9 1 Page\n\n"

For those of you who aren't acquainted with this extraordinary character, he is a middle-aged, fairly well-dressed gentleman who used to hang around\nthe Union bar (until he was\nbanned by Stephen Goulder)\nand on occasion around the\nmore 'sensitive' areas oi College\n(until he was banned by John\nSmith).\nAs if this unique double\nwasn't enough to establish his\ncredentials as a bit of a nut case, he went on to fall hopelessly in\nlove with the nearest woman to\nhand, who happened to be\nCaroline God in, last year's FELIX business manager.

    "content": "CCHI\nBoxing Match\nThis week sees the return of Scaramouche\n(first years won't remember him), in the most\nunusual puzzle I have yet seen. But let him tell\nyou about it:\nScaramouche speaks: .\nPinocchio's been letting you off rather lightly\nrecently, so to remind you of the devious .\ndifficulty of some of my puzzles, here's an\noffering based on the children's game of dots\nand boxes.\nAs you're probably aware, two players start\nwith a grid of dots and alternately draw in lines\njoining the dots in pairs. If a player's move\ncompletes the fourth side of a square cell, he\ninitials it and plays again. Sometimes it is\npossible to complete two cells on a move; in\nthis case the player initials both boxes, but\nonly gets one extra turn. The winner is the\nplayer to initial most boxes.\nSound simple? Child's play? All right, then,\nas a fairly straightforward example of devious\nplay, look at the position in diagram 1. A has\njust won two boxes, and has been forced to\nstart a chain of five for his opponent. If B is\ngreedy and takes the whole chain, he will have\nto hand back the longer chain of nine to A, and\nso will lose 5-11. On the other hand if B takes\nthree of the cells in the chain, but then seals off\nits other end by completing the horizontal line\nin the bottom left hand corner, he only gives\ntwo cells to A who is then compelled to open\nup the chain of nine to B, resulting in a124 win\nfor B. Complete analysis of the game is hard\n(pedantically it's NP-hard for those who know\nwhat that means) and there are lots of\nfascinating and difficult problems which arise\nfrom the strategy: Diagram 2 is a case in point;\nwhat is the (unique) winning move from this\nposition?\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office by Wednesday, 1:00pm. \u00a35 from \u2022\nMenda-Bike for a randomly selected entry.\nLast Weeks Solution\nLast week's puzzle was rather easy, and there\nwere 31 entries. Leann Jones of Maths 2 was\nthe winner, and can collect her prize from the\nFELIX Office on Monday. The solution is\nshown below. Two entries are worthy of\nmention; notably Andrew Lailhamson (I think\nthat's how you spell it) was the youngest\nentrant at only 11, and James Aldridge of\nPhysics 2, who entered all three of the\ncompetitions, and also won the Superkings-2\npuzzle (and can pick up his cheque from the\nFELIX Office etc.). The Superkings answer,\n10*10, is shown below. The code was won by\nRussell Jones of Elec Eng 2, and he can pick up\nhis cheque etc., the solution to which is this:\nTake all the numbers between any two\nconsecutive commas, square them and add\nthem, and that will give the position of the\nletter in the alphabet,\ne.g.23,12,1114,... goes to;\n22\n+32\n, l2+22,l2+ l2+l2+42,.13,5,19,... goes to;\nm,e,s, The answer was:\nMessage follows in Latin.\nEcce Edwardus ursus nunc\ntum po cci pite grad us pul sante toph or um Robinum descend ens.... which is of course the first sentence of\nWinnie-the-Pooh translated into Latin.

    "content": "Dear Sir,\nI am for the rights of the\nindividual. This means that I will\ntry to defend them, as I believe it\nis the right and responsibility of\nall of us to do so.\nWe can never isolate ourselves\nfrom the rest of society; our\nrights are all interdependent and\nlinked. It is with extreme shortsightedness that people say 'Sod\nthe rest, I don't care about their\nrights'. We must remember that\nrights are our own creation; they\nrequire general acceptance and\nprotection by society in order to\nexist.\nThe greatest threat to our\n'freedoms' comes from the lack\nof respect to the individual as a result of degrading him/her into\nmindless components of an\nentity or label. We can so easily\ngroup together individuals under\na simple label, and talk of the\nlabel as if it could have an\nopinion, a character, a personal-it y. In doing so the members of\nthe group become a homogeneity;\nthe fact that they act and think\nas individuals is ignored. Yet our\nvery humanity is about this\nbeautiful individuality. Each of\nour minds is a fantastic library\nof experiences, pictures, inform-ation and history; we can\nunderstand, argue, believe, love,\nand hate. This is our humanity.\nOnce you forget the individual\nthen you forget the human\nbeing. You will not be violating\nthe rights of human beings; you\nwill not be killing, raping,\ntorturing, robbing, or sentencing\nto death human beings. No, we\nmerely become labels, we become a creature created by the\nmind, part of a nightmare of\nmass graves, of tattooed arms,\ngas chambers and statistics. So\nmany people argue about the\n'real world' in terms, not of\nhuman beings, but labels.\nAt Imperial College of Science\nand Technology on Tuesday\nDecember 14, a large group of\nstudents took part in an event\norganised by a Constituent\nStudents' Union( the Royal\nSchool of Mines Union). This\ntook place in the Imperial\nCollege Union building. Members of the reputedly learned\ninstitute watched and laughed at\nvarious films of the sexual act\nincluding sex with animals,\nsadism, and a man dressed as a priest. Also two strippers\nperformed lesbian acts on stage.\nAfterwards a few students\nexposed themselves.\nSome people will say it is all\ngood, harmless fun. To see or\nderive pleasure from the degradation of other people is seen to\nbe a good laugh. Women are\nportrayed as sexual organs to be\nused and abused. They are seen\nmerely as physical entities from\nwhich to gain pleasure. Their\nhumanity is ignored, human\nethics can be forgotten, moral\nlaws need not be applied. A general attitude that in its purest\nform will lead to rape and crimes\nof sexual violence. An attitude\nthat undermines all the rights of\nthe individual female as she is\nnot seen as an individual. This\naffects all women. Indeed it\naffects all individuals. For how\ncan you expect to be treated as\nand respected as a human being\nif you do not do so to others?\nHow can you expect your rights\nto be acknowledged and defended if you do not do so to others?\nHow can you expect to live in a just and 'free' society when your\nactions lead to injustice and the\nerosion or suppression of\n'freedoms'?\nI am by no means a saint; I am as much a part of the\nproblem as those who watched\nthe film. But we must begin\nsomewhere; we must try, and try\nwith hope in our hearts. We\nmust not be disillusioned with\nthe enormity or so-called impracticality of the task, for in the\nend if we do not hope and try if\nwe distance ourselves and forget\nour responsibilities, the future\nfor us and our families will be\nvery bleak.\nI ask you as individuals to do\nyour utmost to brighten our\nfuture, to defend ourselves, and\nour children. Let our voices and\nmoral actions be the sword of\njustice and righteousness.\nYours sincerely,\nMichael Paul Newman\nLife Sciences 1\ncopies of this letter have been sent\nto:\nMargaret Thatcher\nMichael Foot\nMary Whitehouse\nLord Flowers\nThe Observer\nThe Grauniad\nDear Martin,\nC CU activities have always\npandered to the whims of the\nmore infantile students at\nCollege, but are generally looked\non as fun and fairly harmless.\nYet now, surely, the time has\ncome to look again\u2014in recent\nyears the good fun has at times\ngiven way to violence. The most\nrecent manifestation of this cost\nabout \u00a31000 in money that could\nhave been used for other student\nactivities.\nI refer to Morphy Day, when\nit is 'traditional' to sling shit at\npeople from other CCUs and to\nattempt to gain possession of the\nMorphy Oar. This year Guilds\nhired one of the Union transit\nvans to use as their getaway\nvehicle should they manage to\ncapture the oar. All went well\nuntil the oar was near said van,\nat which stage a number of\nstudents climbed on top of the\nvan (estimates run as high as 30!)\nand there was something of a fracas around the back doors.\nThe result was one rear door\nhinge fractured, another bent, a rear door dented beyond repair,\nand both light clusters smashed.\nThese repairs and the straightening of the other back door were\nundertaken at an estimated cost\nof \u00a3300. Certain other repairs\nwere not done\u2014the straightening\nof dents in the roof and the\nreplacement of the bonnet (both\nof which would have been\nrequired to return the van to its\nprevious state) were not worth it.\nThe problems, however,\ndidn't stop there. The van was\ndue to be sold (it was suggested\nto Silwood Park) to allow ICU Transport to buy two new\nTransit vans, and it was hoped\nto raise \u00a31000 by the sale\n(although a more realistic\nestimate was \u00a3750). The van is\nnow practically worthless (estimated value of \u00a3300). Suggestions\nthat Guilds might buy the van\nfor \u00a3700 or that it should be sold\nhave the same effect\u2014a further\nnet loss of income of between\n\u00a3450-\u00a3700 distributed among the\nvarious students' unions.\nFurthermore, a van hired\nfrom Swan National by R SMU also suffered damage to rear\ndoors and hinges which, if nothing else, cost a great deal of\ngood will with a company regularly used by RC C and ACC clubs for transport.\nI do not wish to suggest that\nthese ' traditional' activities\nshould be stopped\u2014I feel that\nfor most participants these\nevents are great fun and certainly provide a welcome change\nfrom the pressure of work at\nImperial. However I do feel that\nthe odd \u00a31000 here or there\n(which we may never get to hear\nabout) is too high a price to pay.\nSurely it must be possible for the\nCCUs to get together and agree\nsome sort of 'code of conduct'\n(or similar) to prevent the\npossibility of such wanton\ndestruction in the future.\nYours sincerely,\nNick Pyne\nDear Sir\nI, for one, was delighted to\nhear of Barney McCabe's purchase of that infamous baby\ngrand piano from Harrods. But,\nalas, I have only ever played it\ntwice when the thing has been in\nfull working order. Firstly, the\npedals came off after having\nbeen on for only a month or two.\nThis made playing somewhat\ndifficult without any sustain, but\nas this was the only piano in\nCollege on which all the keys\nfunctioned, I had no choice but\nto per server e. So, I was somewhat dismayed to find, on\nattempting to play the piano in\nquestion at the beginning of this\nterm that almost all the keys\nwere stuck. I was informed that\nthe cleaners had been allowed to\nclean the piano with water, thus\ncausing the wood to expand and\nthe keys to stick. Is this any way\nto look after a \u00a32000 piano? It\nseems a bit of a waste of Union\nmoney. Yours\nGuy Riddihough\nBiochem 2\nDear Sir\nOn a number of occasions this\nyear I have walked into the\nUnion Bar and found the bar\nstaff easily outnumbering the\ncustomers. The fact is students\nat IC can no long c afford to\ndrink enough to forget the lack\nof women. It seems to me that\nthis underhand policy of the\nCollege hierarchy to keep\nstudents sober can only lead to\nfrustration and the unsuspecting\nstudent will be driven to pursuing his academic work to\nfurther the name of IC and at the\ndetriment of social life within the\nCollege. How long can this\npolicy go on? Will the IC student\nstay blind to the oppressive\ndictator? Join the protest against\nacademic excellence. Be in the\nUnion Bar 7 nights a week 6pm to 11pm. Drink until you puke\nand then drink again. If the\nUnion is full drink in Harry's. Take no chances, carry a bottle\nof whisky in case you wind up\nsober at midnight and if your\nbank manager complains, hit\nhim on the head with the empty\nbottle.

It\nappeared quite harmless, and\neven docile, until a hastily-summoned FELIX photographer arrived on the scene, where-upon the gorilla fled. The\nphotographer gave chase but\nwhile he was trying to photograph the gorilla it entered a lift\nand travelled towards the top of\nthe building. The photographer,\nhampered by his camera, failed\nto catch it, and it vanished into\nthe maze of corridors in the\nSherfield Building.\nSecurity staff claimed to have\nseen nothing, but told FELIX that it is well known that a student in Linstead owns a gorilla costume, and sightings of\nthe beast were quite common\nuntil two years ago.\nThe Sherfield gorilla could not\nquite escape our photographer by\ndashing into a lift.\nFriday, January21,19831 I Free!\n\n"

Mr Goulder\nthen wrote to the Constituent\nCollege Unions informing them\nthat in his opinion the battle\nshould be discontinued. 'Gone\nare the days when students could\nindulge in organised vandalism',\nhe told FELIX. Mr Goulder has\nnever taken part in the battle.\nFor the last eight years, teams\nfrom the CCUs have fought for\npossession of the Morphy Oar\nby flinging revolting substances\nat each other, to the displeasure\nof the local residents of Putney,\nwho would find the remaining\nmess on the tow-path the\nfollowing morning, This year the\nRCSU fire-engine, Jez, was used\nto hose down the tow-path after\nthe battle, but the cleaning was\nnot as thorough as had been\nhoped.\nAnother factor influencing Mr\nGoulder's decision is the expense to the Union; the event is\nfunded by ICU Rag, and not by\nthe CCUs. Last term \u00a344 was\nspent on dustbin lids to be used\nas shields and \u00a3300 of damage\nwas caused to one of the Union\nvans. In addition, the oar was\nbroken and most of it has since\nbeen stolen.\nThe decision to ban the towpath battle will not affect the\nrowing which also takes place on\nMorphy Day. Plans to move the\nevent to Harlington sports\nground are unlikely to go ahead\nas there is no river there!\nNUS Survey of\nIC Students\nImperial College has been\nchosen as one of sixty institutes\nof higher education to participate in a survey of students'\nliving standards in Britain. The\nNational Union of Students has\ncommissioned the survey from\nthe Survey Research Unit at the\nPolytechnic of North London as\npart of a review of the present\nsystem of grants. The results will\nprobably influence the NUS's response to the government's projected student loan scheme.\nAlthough Imperial College has\nnot been affiliated to the NUS\nfor five years, the Union has\nagreed to assist in the survey\nwhich coincides with one currently being organised by the\nCollege's External Affairs\nCommittee. Some seventy-five\nNUS questionnaires and ISO of\nthe College's own will be sent to\nrandomly selected students.\nSovereign\nSwitchboard\nThe telephone switchboard at the\nSovereign Hotel has been reconnected and students can now\nreceive incoming calls in their\nrooms.\n' The Sovereign is the smaller of\nthe College's two new head\ntenancies, and its forty eight\nstudents, mostly postgraduates,\nhave been unable to receive\nincoming calls until now. It has\ntaken three months and the\ncombined efforts of Lillian\nHarrison, the student manager\nof the hotel, and Michael\nArthur, the Student Services\nOfficer, to have the system\nrestored.\nThe switchboard was originally disconnected early last term\nby the warden, Andy Walker,\nand the hotel's proprietors, who\nwill pay the hundred pound\nre connection fee.\nThe hotel now has four lines\nwhich wil be operated by the\nresidents between 6:00 and\n10:00pm every evening.

Karen has\npreviously had experience of this\ntype of work when she was\nsao bat ical Education and Welfare Officer at the University of\nWales at Bangor, where she took\na degree in history.\nSince leaving there she has\ncompleted a one year teacher\ntraining course at Ormskirk, but\ndecided early on that she didn't want to become a teacher\nbecause she 'couldn't stand\nworking in a school.' Since\nfinishing this course she has been\nunemployed for seven months.\nShe was described as 'efficient\nand hard-working\u2014not at all\nsuitable for the job' by Gary\nTurner, another Student Services employee. (Gary was later\ndescribed as the 'resident office\nslob' by Student Services Officer\nMichael Arthur.) Karen's first\nimpression of the Student\nServices office was that it\nprovides a good service to IC\nstudents, comparing favourably\nwith similar services at Bangor,\nOf Imperial College she thought\nit was 'strange', citing the\nmale/female ratio and the fact\nthat the College does not play as\nmuch of a central role in the\nsocial lives of IC students as\nmight be expected.\nPimlico Connects\nAward\nThe Pimlico Connection Society\nand the Communication of\nScientific Ideas Course have\nreceived joint recognition from\nthe 'Education for Capability'\nmovement of the Royal Society\nfor the Arts.

The problem is that they need to\n'raise money quickly to escape from torment in\nan apartment block infested with partying\n'swingers' whose morals they detest. After\nbeing ripped off and abused they hit upon a novel scheme to make easy money; by luring\nswingers to their room with a tempting ad in\nthe local per v's column and then bashing them\never so neatly with Paul's frying pan, they\ndiscover that they can unload their fat wallets.\nThis, of course, gives Bartel the excuse to\ninclude some hilarious bedroom scenes with\nvarious weirdos acting out their bizarre\nfantasies before being bopped at the crucial\nmom eV it. When a handsome hustler, Raoul,\ndiscovers their scheme he offers to dispose of\nthe bodies, but soon things start to go wrong.\nEating Raoul definitely has an air of its own.\nWhether it is a comment on modern-day\nAmerica or just a clever farce isn't important.\nPaul and Mary Bland discover the means to achieve their dream. The unsung star of the\nfilm is a large, black frying-pan (bottom left).\nIt does prove to be a pleasing black comedy,\nwith a good performance by Bartel and Mary\nWoronov as the happy couple, but the visual\ngags in no way make up for the absence of\nwitty dialogue. The film relies far too much on\nparodying a sex farce (to good effect) but\nignores a wealth of opportunities for some\ngood, sick jokes.

    "content": "The Dinner for Two Club is an interesting and\nunusual concept in eating out\u2014particularly for\nthe real restaurant addict.\nThe idea is that you buy a membership card\nfrom the Club which lasts for a year and\nentitles you to two free meals in each of sixty\nrestaurants, or, in other words, you can get\n120 free meals for \u00a328.75 (the cost of the card).\nThe snag is that you need to go with at least\none other person who pays for their own meal,\nin full. Also you have to pay for drinks, any\ncover charge and service charge.\nIn effect it means a significant reduction in\nthe bill although since you only get one free\nmeal irrespective of the size of your party\nmaximum benefits are achieved by eating out\nas a twosome.\nThe main advantage of having the card is\nthat you can then afford to eat in places which\nyou might not even think of trying.\nWith your card you get a directory in wallet\nsized folder containing brief details of the sixty\nrestaurants and giving an average cost for two\nwith the card, exclusive of wine.\nThese costs vary from \u00a312 for two (ie \u00a36 for\ntwo with the card) for a Turkish restaurant in\nMayfair to around \u00a330 for two in some of the\nmore expensive ones. On average, the figure is\naround \u00a320. Just about every kind of\nrestaurant imaginable is represented and\nalmost all are situated within a couple of miles\nof College.\nOne might wonder what the restauranteurs\nget out of this. Apparently they feel that it is\nworth it to get new customers and hope that it\nwill bring further recommendations.\nAs with most things there are a number of\ndisadvantages; some of the subscribing\nrestaurants drop out of th t scheme and the\nClub does not have a very efficient system for\nnotifying members. This means that you could\ngo to a restaurant, eat a mammoth meal,\nhand over your card and be met with blank\nlooks and a demand for the full whack or\nservices in the washing up department. This\ncan be overcome by checking when you book\nor asking 'when you first go in.\nAnother point to remember is that drinks\ntend to be expensive in good restaurants and\nthat cover charges and high service charges\nare the general rule.\nNevertheless you can .expect to get away\nwith a bill for around \u00a316\u2014\u00a320 for two \u2014 with\nwine \u2014 in most of the restaurants listed.\nSince it would be virtually impossible to eat\nout 120 times in one year the large number of\nrestaurants is more useful in terms of choice\nthan in working out how much money you can\nmake with the card. However, you only need\nto use the card three or four times to recover\nthe \u00a328.50 that it costs.\nUnless you are fairly keen on eating out, the\nDinner for Two Club is not really a sensible\nin veste ment. If, on the other hand, it is\nsomething that you do regularly, then it is well\nworth considering.\nFurther details can be obtained from:\nDinner for Two Club,\n24 Curzon Street,\nLondon W1X 7A E.
