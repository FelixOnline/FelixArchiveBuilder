    "content": "Page 2 FELIX March6 th,1973 Letters from heaven\nSir,\nI must confess that I did\nnot find Alasdhair Campbell's letter very interesting.\nThis was largely due to his\npersistent use of 'big' words,\nwhich, in my state of literal\nsub-normality, I found difficult to understand. Despite\nthis lamentable handicap, I gather from reading his letter that he knows even less\nabout the crux of Christianity than I do about Communism.\nUnfortunately, his apparent\nignorance of Christianity is\nonly typical of this University. We are, after all, supposed to be scientists and\nengineers and, as such, our\ncommon approach to any\ntopic should be one of 'logi-cal' analysis of the relevant\nfacts, but it would be optimistic to believe that one in\nten of us has applied this\nprocedure to Christianitly.\nConsidering the magnitude\nof Christ's claims, it would\nbe foolish to dismiss him\nwithout a proper examination.\nWe must, therefore, begin by\nlooking at the historical basis\nof Christianity. The possibilities open to us are: either\nChrist lived or he did not.\nAn investigation of the\nauthenticity of the Gospels,\nthe Epistles, and the records\nkept by Tacitus and Josephus, the main historians of\nthat era, should clear up that\npoint. Assuming you then\nreach the conclusion that I did, i.e., he did exist, we then\nprogress to the question, who\nwas he? Again two choices,\neither a man or 'The Son of\nGod'. If he was a man, then\non top of being a good faith\nhealer (curing the deaf,\ndumb, blind and paralysed)\nhe was a miracle (sorry \u2014it's the only apt word) doctor healing lepers, cripples\nand raising the dead. He was\nalso an ace trickster turning\nwater to wine (concealed\npipes in the floor?) walking\non the water (a ford, of\ncourse) feeding the five\nthousand, what a whopper.\nHe certainly fooled the Jews,\nthey were so afraid that they\ncrucified him (but he was\nunder drugs, so he did not\nmind so much).\nThe alternative to all this\nis that Christ was who he\nsaid he was, i.e. God. This\nway the whole bible falls into place and we do not need\nto make up any weird ex-pla nations. But if he was God\nthen by ignoring him, as most\ndo, they are gambling not\nonly with just their physical\nlives but with all eternity.\nI, therefore, urge everyone\nwho reads this letter to make\na thorough investigation of\nChrist's life.\nYours praying for your souls,\nR.E. SLOT AP.S. \u2014 // you have any\ndifficulties in finding literature (Haldane Library) or\nhave any questions, please\ncontact me (Civ. Eng. 2),\nor your local friendly Christian, there are plenty about\nI.C. Sir,\nI am to avoid using the\npages of \"Felix\" for long\nlunge and petty arguments\nbetween two people, many\nsuch arguments can be resolved on a personal level.\nHowever I am forced to\nwrite an answer to a letter\nby Mr. Alasdhair Campbell,\nnot only for his information,\nbut more especially for all\nthe people whom he may\nhave misled (intentionally or\nnot) in the historical facts\nabout Jesus Christ.\nHe gave Jesus the status\nof a revolutionary, but stated\nthat his death was \"record-ed in the annals of the era\nas that of just another\ntroublemaker\". A wild state-ment, and at ruthless one.\nThis \"annals of the era\" is\na vagary, but it must be inferred he speaks of the two\ncontemporary historians Josephus, governor of Gallilee\nand a Jew, and Tacitus the\nHistorian of Imperial Rome.\nNeither of these refer to\nChrist as a troublemaker, nor\nto his death as that of a troublemaker. On the contrary Josephus writes:\n\"It was at this time a man\nappeared, if 'man' is the\nright word, who had all the\nattributes of a man, but\nseemed something greater.\nHis actions, certainly, were\nsuperhuman\", and later in\nthe same journal:\n\"So they (the Jewish Authorities in Jerusalem) seized\nhim and crucified him in defiance of all Jewish Traditions.\" These words were\nwritten by a Jew not by a Christian.\nThe second factual error\nwas saying \"though in his\ntime he had no effect\". I presume most people are aware\nof the self-contradictory nature of this statement in the\ncontext of the letter. Firstly,\nChrist had sufficient effect,\nthat without ever expressing\npolitical ambitions, but simply \"speaking to them concerning the Kingdom of God\"\n(Acts 1 v3) he was crucified, however the effects did\nnot end here, in Israel there\nwas widespread persecution\nof Christians before the year\n50 A.D. Even the Romans,\nthe greatest military power\nknown up to that time, were\nafraid of Christians, because\nof their revolutionary beliefs,\nand unless Christianity had\nbeen having an effect the\nRoman power machine could\nwell have afforded to ignore\nit. Greek thinking was turned\nupside down in Corinth,\nAthens and Thessalonica all\nthese things taking place\n300-350 years before the\ndate he cited for the \"poli-t ical efforts\" of Christianity.\nThe greatest of his historical mistakes was very illogically to ignore a great bulk\nof evidence to be found in\nthe Bible, even anti-Christian\nhistorians. could not dare\nIGNORE it.\nI confess that the arguments used by Mr. Campbell\nare old, and have been used\nby Christ's enemies throughout history, argument which\nis precipitated from a high\ndegree of il logic or selective\nfact-choosing suggests that\neven Christ's enemies see he\nis still having an effect on\npeople.\nSo let us dispense with\nmyths and look at facts. If\nit is suggested that Christianity has been used as a political or materialistic\nweapon, we must realise that\nthis is NOT the Christianity,\nthe Good-News, which Christ\npreached. For example,\nChrist's Church is not people\nwho just pop down the local\nChurch once a week and then\ncarry on living a Christless\nlife for the rest of the week.\nChrist's Church is people\nwho lived for Him, in his\nstrength. Jesus was not, on\nhis own admission and o th ers, a teacher or philosopher,\nbut God made tangible for\nmankind to understand, and\nhe never showed much interest in politics.\nHe came to change lives\nand does so when we accept\nhis death for our sins -and\nask him into our lives as\nLord. Many people are happy\nas atheists and feel perfectly\nsatisfied in life, they feel they\ndon't need Christ, I certainly\ndid, but that is only because\nwe cannot realize the changes in our lives that Christ\ncan effect, in the words of\nPaul:\n\"The un spiritual man does\nnot receive the gifts of the\nSpirit of God . . . and he is\nnot able to understand them,\nbecause they are only understood spiritually\" (1 Corinthians 2:14).\nHow can we possibly begin to know what Jesus has\nto say to us until we all stop\nignoring the issue and face\nthe facts as they are. I pray\nthat all readers of this letter\nincluding Mr. Campbell will\ntry to find out these facts,\nbecause they are the TRUE\nfacts of life.\nYours in Christ,\nMAURICE MOLONEY.\nDear Sir,\nThere has been a growing\nconcern in recent years with\nthe problems of drug abuse,\nrising crime rates, sexual per-version, and most recently\ndepression and suicide which\nhave permeated all elements\nof our society. Many groups\nand organisations have\nsought the solution to these\nproblems, but most have experienced very little in the\nway of concrete results.\nThere is, however, a programme which has resulted\nin the dramatic transformation of purposeless, unhappy-lives into useful, productive,\nand happy people. It is\nknown as \"The Children of\nGod\".\nThe success of this programme is the result of\nadopting a whole new life\nstyle \u2014 one based on love,\nsharing, mutual co-operation\nand the desire to help one's fellow man\u2014in an environment of peace and harmony\nwhere people can grow and\nrealize their full potential as\nhuman beings.\nMany people have criticized this group for their revolutionary way of life, but they\ncannot refute the fact that it\nworks. If you would like to\nknow more about this way of\nlife and the work that is being done to help our fellow\nmen in all parts of the\nworld I will be very happy\nto come to your college and\nmeet you personally. There\nare also several films available and I am certain that\nsuch a programme would be\nof great interest to people\nlike you who are concerned\nwith the social problems of\nthis day and age.\nTo make arrangements for\na meeting or for further in-formation, phone me at 01-464 7769.

I expect you've\nheard most of it before but the only way to get\nany of you involved is to keep ramming everything\ndown your throats. Believe it or not we had our\nHustings last Tuesday but not many people seemed to care; despite the fact that every single post (bar\nAcademic Affairs Officer) was contested (which is\nmore than can be said for the I.C. elections).\nAnd so to this week. Having recovered from the\nstrains and pains of the soccer sixes (you were\nthere weren't you) we find ourselves in Tuesday,\nMarch6 th. Ring a bell?

Easy you may say. Well it would be, were it not for you and your fellow compatriots perched up on Beit roof\nchucking water over all the competitors.

No one remembers\nwhen Guilds last failed to win the Sparkes Cup, and this year should be no different. This is, how-ever, but a quiet prelude to the day you've all been\nwaiting for, the one and only GUILDS REVUE. Yes folks, Thursday, MARCH8 th, for the meagre pittance of 2 5 p you can turn yourselves on to a sexy\nstripper, a dirty film, a drag artiste, and some very\nsilly sketches (performed by not so silly Guildsm en). However, to be the success it deserves, it is\nessential that you get a sketch out from your year,\nit need n't be Monty Python class, just short and stupid. There's loads of prizes to be won, and the\nstar of fast year's revue, Mr. P. Nowit, will be making a return performance. This is not to be missed. Get your sketches ready now and let Tony know\nhow many sketches you have.\nA short intermission and it's Tuesday again. A week today and it's your lucky day. Those hard\nworking members of your exec have provided for\nyour tant alisa tion, not one, but two events. Firstly\nat 1.15 p.m. in ME542, we have the GUILDS ELECTIONS.

Corcoran\nPhosphorous the Jobrot\nand Ferocious Din\nThe ante penultimate part of\na serial is ation of the book\nby S.J. Swailes\nHardly had he spoken than a tiny black dot appeared on the horizon. The three watched with some interest as it\ncame nearer and nearer. When it was only fifty yards or\nso from the stern of the boat, they realised that there were two creatures swooping down towards them \u2014 a little\nblack thing and a much larger kah ki coloured one. With a flapping of wings, the two beings thumped down on the\ndeck. Foe tid looked very tattered indeed.\" I must a polg is e for my appearance, sir\", he said slightly out of breath,\" but the weather last night wa s^omewhat inclement. May I present Doctor Kevin Ton key of the Flying Doctor Service?\" with a courtly wave of a little wing. Foe tid indicated the gentleman now sitting on the cabin roof.\" G' day\" said Dr. Kev, and beamed round at the startled crew. The Flying Doctor was a short stout man, clad in\nkhaki bush shirt and short s.He wore a wide brimmed hat,\nfirmly tied under his chin, and his face glowed a deep red. From his shoulder blades sprouted two magnificent white feathered wings, now neatly folded down his back.\" Certainly that was a fair old flight\", he said, wiping his face with a red spotted handkerchief,\" me and the little\nflying weasel here wondered if we was ever going to make it'\". Foe tid looked suitably supercilious.\" Well, thank goodness you have\", said Ferocious quickly,\" perhaps you' d like to come and have a look at the patient\".\" Too right\", said Dr. Kev, picking up his little black bag from the doghouse roof where he had put it on landing. Together the doctor and Ferocious went below, and the\nlatter indicated a still muttering George.\" Palsied Dingoes\", expostulated the medical man,\" A nasty case of O' Reilly' s Tremble if I ever saw one\". He looked worried.\" Is it serious?\" asked Ferocious.\" Well, that depends\", sad Dr. Kev.\" You see, sport, this particular lu rg i is named after a man called Feel erO' Reilly who was the first to be struck down, as we say in the medical profession. Now Feeler was a politician, and he\nwas taken in the middle of making a speech, so, of course, nobody noticed until afterwards, ho,h o. Anyway, there seemed to be nothing that could be done for him, so he was put in bed at home, and doctors came from all over the globe to see him, but nobody could find a cure. So poor old Feeler just went on muttering in the privacy of his own home, until one day his wife, a big sheila she was, could stand it no longer. It was the muttering, y' see, got right up her nose, as we say in the medical profession. Anyway, like Is aid,s he couldn't take anymore, so she hit old Feeler a real dinkum belt over the head with a frying pan, and shouted\" Shut up, you boring old fool!\" Well, the cure was instantaneous. Feeler lept out of bed, absolutely his old self again. Mind you there were some as reckoned he was easier to understand when he had the\naffliction on him, but they were n't qualified medical men\".\" Fascinating\", said Ferocious,\" but how does that help George?\" Dr. Kev looked annoyed.\" Were n't you listening, mate? That' s the only known cure. You bash the patient over the head with a frying pan and shout\" Shut up, you boring old fool!\" Never fails. Or hardly ever. There have been cases of people getting carried away on the bashing bit, and finishing the patient off, but that wouldn't be under your controlled medical circumstance s.O. K.?\"\"O.K.\" said Ferocious, unconvinced, and wondering if\nhe should ask to see the doctor's credentials.\" Right\" bellowed the Flying Doctor,\" get those other fellows down here and we'll continue with the treatment.\" Ferocious called Ph oph oro us, the Twig worm and the tiny bat down into the cabin, and explained the unlikely cure.\" Is there going to be any blood?\" asked the Twig worm nervously,\" I'm afraid that I faint if there' s any blood\". The Doctor beamed,\" Can't guarantee nothing, sport\", he said,\" but there'sa fair chance this should be a bloodless one\". The Twig worm heaved a sigh of relief.\" Now listen carefully, cobb ers\", went on Dr. Kev.\" Is hall strike the patient a medically approved clout over the head with this cooking utensil what I 've just found\". He waved Ferocious' frying pan in the air, \" and as Ido so you all shout' Shut up, you boring old fool!' as loud as you can. Alright?\" D r.Ton key positioned himself.\" Now!\" he shouted, and let fly a huge swing of the frying pan.\" Bo ing\" it went as it struck George's head. The handle bent into a'U' shape.\" Shut up, you boring old fool!\" bellowed the assembled throng.\" Procreation flu\", said George and turned over.\" Ah, newts!\" swore the good doctor,\" not loud enough on the\" shut up etc.\" We'll have to try again. This time shout as loud as you can. That Mr s.O' Reilly was a big lunged woman\". He jumped up and down on the handle of the frying pan in a medical manner. When it had ret ur ned to something like its original shape, the doctor took it in his huge hand once again.\" Split those lungs, this time\", he said. He swung. Ker do ink went George's head and pan.\" Shut up you boring old fool!\" screeched the rest of the team. George opened his eyes.\" What on earth is going on?' he said indignantly.\" Great!\" grinned Dr. Kev.\" another victory for advanced medical research\".\" How do you feel?\" asked Ferocious of a puzzled George.\" I seem to have a splitting headache\", he said,\" and what is this gentleman with the wings doing here, and once again, what is going on?\"\" The headache is one of the unfortunate side effects of\nthe cure, sport,\" explained the doctor.\" Pardon?\" said George.\" That' s the other one,\" said Dr. Kev\" a temporary deafness caused by having these bellows up you rear hole\". George still looked rather confused, so Ferocious s at down beside him and explained the events of the last twenty four hours.\" Well, well\", said George when Ferocious had finished shouting at him,\" what a busy time you have had. I can only say well done everyone and thankyou, doctor\".\" No trouble, mate,\" said the do c.\"all in a day's work. How about we crack a couple of tubes to celebrate the amazing recovery?\"\" Eh?\" said Phosphorous.\" I think the doctor is suggesting that we open some can s of lager, of the type I see protruding from his little\nblack bag', explained Ferocious.\" Too right\", said Kev, reaching into his medical bag and pulling out several can s of the famous anti pode an beverage. In no time they were all sitting out in the cockpit with a tube each, enjoying the sun, and listening to some of\nDr. Kev' s unlikely stories, of life in the Flying Doctor Service. Even Foe tid had joined them, sharing a can with Phosphorous, who had fetched him a straw after much argument.\" I could not possibly presume, sir,\" said the little bat.\nBut Phosphorous had insisted, and Foe tid hung decorously from the Job rot's elbow sucking occasionally at the straw.\" Well, cobb ers,\" said Kev. finally,\" I must be about my business, I suppose. So I 'll bid you' se all g' day\". They begged him to stay for lunch at least, and Ferocious was much concerned to question the doctor further on his story of the kangaroo and the water diviner. But Dr. Kev was adam an t.He packed the remaining can s of lager away in\nhis bag and spread his wings. To the surprise of all, he\nhad a wingspan of some twelve or thirteen feet, beautiful wings, spotless downy white, with great rope like muscles flexing just beneath the plumage.\" See you\", said Doctor Kevin Ton key and flapped his wings once, twice and he was away \u2014 powering up into\nthe sun. He turned and soared over the top of the mast to give a last wave before heading out over these a, effortless wing beats taking him over the horizon and out of sight. On the Fanny they s at in silence for a moment. Ferocious broke it.\n\" Come on\", he said,\" we have stil U to find the elusive Twig wor mery \u2014 shall we make a move?\" And they did. "

As we enter its small\nbut inviting portals my fiancee is surprised to find\none of her old primary school friends taking the\ntickets, but then the Young Vic is like that, friendly,\ninformal, and very much alive. The stage is surrounded in a horse shoe fashion by upward sloping\nbenches and there is room for about 3 0 0 , including\nthose sitting in the very small gallery. Here one\nfeels part of the play, friends of the actors and an\nintegral part of the atmosphere. Here the theatre\nis for living not watching.\nThe day is Saturday, February 24th, and the prod uc tion, Brighouse's famous \"Hobson's Choice\".\nFor those not familiar with the story of this comedy set in Salford in 1 8 8 0 , it concerns Mr. H.H. Hobson, owner of a shoe shop, and his three daughters,\nthe pretty Alice and Vic key, and the dominant Mag gie, who serves in the shop. At the age of 3 0\nMaggie is considered past marriage but she has her\neye on the very meek, master boot-maker, Willie Moss op, who works in the shop and who, although\npromised to his landlady's daughter, one Ada Figgins, is soon \" un promised\" by the resourceful\nMaggie. Mr. Hobson, fond of his frequent visits to\nthe \" Moon rake r Inn\" is unable to prevent the subsequent marriage and in drowning his sorrows falls\ndown an open cellar hole into Beanstock's store\nhouse. Young lawyer, Albert Prosser, is engaged by\nMaggie to sue Henry Hobson for trespass on behalf\nof Beenstock's and in settling \" out of court\" Henry\nfinds he loses \u00a3500 and his other two daughters to\nAlbert Prosser and Freddy Beanstock, while Maggie\nand Willie have set up their own shoe shop in their\nbasement flat. Hobson' s trade dwindles and when\nHenry is told by Doctor MacFarlane that he must\ngive up alcohol to save his life, Maggie and Willie move in to help Henry and take over the shop, which now becomes \" Moss op and Hobson'. The loud, temperamental and awkward Mr. Hobson is brilliantly portrayed by Peter Bayliss playing\na role familiar to his more famous one (that of\nDennis' father in \" Fen n Street Gang\"). Andrew Robertson as the short, funny looking Willie, was\njust as convincing. With stage props kept to a minim um(a few clogs and boots, cash register, door,\netc.), the art of acting well was actively displayed\nbefore us by a cast. and atmosphere that fired the\nimagination and absorbed one completely in the\nThe Young Vic has taken to the fifties of late, to\nthe days before The Beatles and Harold Wilson put\nthe spiritual and material gloss on the swinging\nsixties. The world revealed is as distant as Pompeii.\nThe girls wear suspenders and girdles and one tiny\nslip leads to tragic consequences. The men wear\nstraight trousers, shirts that need ironing and still\ntake the likes of J.B. Priestley seriously. Hair is\nshort, the middle classes get what's coming to them,\nmen are angry and young and the woman's place is\nby the kitchen sink. The whole thing is in fact damn\nnigh unbelievable, except when you remember that\nthese are essentially differences in manners. Material considerations, to judge by the appalling housing\nconditions which are still reality for most of us,\nhave not changed so much, and now the gloss is\nwearing thin too. The Labour Party is a bad joke,\nthe Beatles have gone and Georgie no longer dazzles\nus on the wing. University students, the pride of\nthe Welfare State, are poor and graduates are un employed. The music has not died quickly, but\ndrifted away, like Glenn Miller in his aeroplane,\nand no-one quite knows where it's gone. These\nplays show us the world before it came.\nI 've seen two of them, A Taste of Honey, by Shelagh Delaney, first produced in 1958, and Look Back\nin Anger, by the Angry Young Man himself, John\nOsborne, which dates I think from 1 9 5 6 . As might\nbe clear from the above, I wasn't really interested\nin them as immortal drama \u2014 they're not \u2014 but\nin the way in which they reflect social values and\nchange, and on that level I highly recommend both.\nThe plots and situations were a bit contrived \u2014 do\nprostitutes really go around with their daughters\nlike that? asked my companion at A Taste of Honey\n\u2014 but the characters generally made up for it. Julia\nMcCarthy, who plays the daughter, was a fantastically seductive schoolgirl, appealing to all sorts of\nplay. It was supremely funny, often highlighted by\nthose small actions and expressions that symbolise\nthe difference between playing and living a part.\nDuring the intervals one chats with those around\nyou, makes new friends, or buys a coffee or ice\ncream.\nWith the Young Vic so close to I.C. by tube, for\n4 0 p you can only give yourself a very pleasant surprise one evening. As Willie Moss op said looking\nabout the shop he now half-owned, in his brand\nnew suit, at the end of the play, \" Well, by gum!\" Jeremy Barker\nfetishes in her gym-slip and bobby-socks, and her\nmother wasn't bad either. \" As' e got long legs? Ah luv 'em wi' long legs\", she enquires of her da ugh ter's dastardly sailor-boy, and she is still attractive\nenough for her own fancy-man to cry out joyfully\nafter a furtive feel \u2014 \" Christ, you're not wearing\nyour girdle!\" It makes you feel so young, and the old seem so\ninnocent. The characters are for the most part totally\nunaware of themselves, and hence of any alternatives to what they are. Peter, the chauvinist male\npork er in Taste is a stereotyped, unthinking tyrant,\ncomplete with eye-patch, cigar, whisky-bottle and an acute sense of Who has the money around here\n\u2014 i.e. him. Jimmy Porter in Look Back is an equally\npredictable intellectual, with his red-brick back-ground \u2014 he thinks like a red brick \u2014 his humanitarian outbursts by George Orwell out of D.H. Lawrence, his \" quality\" Sunday papers, which he\ntakes seriously, and the soft centre which makes\nhim settle for a\" Me Teddy \u2014 You Squirrel\" existence with his legitimate girl-friend after all. As for\nthe women, they wear sexy underwear, iron shirts,\nmake tea and worry. They are vulnerable \u2014 pre g nancy hits them hard in both plays \u2014 and they are\ndependent. Sometimes they are beautiful too, like\nJulia McCarthy' s fantastically seductive schoolgirl\nin Taste, and sometimes they even start to think\nabout getting turned on, like the actress in Look\nBack, but even she retreats back into her well-groomed, church going \u2014 how many actresses still\ngo to church? \u2014 little world at the end, and there\nare only the merest hints of the coming awareness\nof women and of the release of their human cap a cities.\nIn fact, it is precisely this awareness that makes\nthe total effect of the sixties seem more spiral than\ncyclic. People are by now more conscious of domination patterns, of the importance of economic independence, and of alternative modes of existence than they were in the fifties, and the disappearance of Harold Wilson's coat of varnish cannot\ninterfere with this vital change. We still have our\nsmiling morons, of course, but we also have a far\nmore developed perception of society, and while this does not in itself change anything, nothing is\nlikely to be changed without it. Anyway, go and see\nthese plays.

    "content": "Pdge 4 FELIX March6 th1973 President's Piece\nAvid readers of my writings will have noticed a single-minded concentration on grants. This week I want to write about three other matters which affect\nstudents very much indeed. Funnily enough all of\nthem turn out to be linked up with the problem of student financing.\nHALLS AND HOUSES The facts of rents and grants for undergraduates are\nas follows:\nBoard & Lodging Estimates for Lodging\nTotal Grant \u00a3 Element Board\n3972/73 480 27.5 163* 112\n197374 500 28.5 163** 122\n* Meals are estimated at 75p per day for 31 weeks.\nN.B. This is the College's estimate.\n** Assuming no increase in refectory priced(!)\nCharges range from \u00a3102 to \u00a3120 per year in the case\nof halls and from \u00a3101 to \u00a3116 for houses. In all cases\nthese figures include \u00a311 (ie 35p per week) contribution\nto the Building Fund (a voluntary payment to help finance the new hall).\nThe actual amount paid is around the national\nelement in the grant. l.C rents arc only \" low\" because\nconference and block bookings in vacations provide so\nmuch revenue. In fact we only think of them as low\nbecause London rents are so outrageously high.\nNext week's Student Residence Committee (a College\nCommittee with student representation) will receive a report on finances. This will indicate a likely \u00a38,000 deficit next year and recommend economies. Student Ho uses would get what they need for re decoration( in case\nthey fall apart) halls would get a48 per cent cut. Even\nso the basic \"economic\" rent would be \u00a33.65 or \u00a3124 per\nyear (if the full 35p levy stays) is over the national element even assuming that refectory prices stay steady.\nGiven that the union is trying to catch up with the\neffect of past inflation we can hardly be expected to\nagree to more without a fight.\nSTUDENT NUMBERS The University Grants Committee (through which IC\ngets in Govcrment money) has decided that in the\nnext five years our student numbers should increase by\n25 per cent, the recurrent grant (which pays running\ncosts etc.) increasing only 11 per cent. Apparently more\nstudents can be crammed into our buildings than they\nwere built for. Worse still, what is the effect on the accommodation problem? 1.000 more students pushing\nup rents in Kensington, breaking up the local community to make way for bed-sit racketeers, or commuting\nfrom Wimbledon, Richmond. Clapham. and, even fur-ther. The Greater London Development Plan suggests\nthat students should in fact be moved out of London.\nThis may sound extreme but as I see it either the cx-pan sion must come by building new colleges outside\nLondon with proper accommodation or the Government\nwill have to ban office block and luxury hotel building in London and supply the finance for both student\naccommodation and housing for the people of London.\nTo make matters worse there is grave doubt about\nwhether the new hall will in fact be built.\nThe \"brighter\" side is that fewer school-leave rs want\nto study science at Universities in general and I.C. in\nparticular. Can you blame them? Lousy London digs,\nlousy grants and lousy job prospects in many fields. For\nthe first time lecturers interviewing applicants have met\nwith worries about the level of grants from school-leave rs. REFECTORY PRICES Prices will not go up next term. OK. But if inflation\ncontinues (if?) the refectory committee may well be\nlaced with the proposal to increase them from 1s tAu gust (when the union is at its weakest point, funnily\nenough). Clearly j f we intend to stop them we have to\ndo it now. Subsidies would be better than nothing but\nthat would tie us to Mooney. Basically- we need grant\nincreases to match inflation so that we can have\nthe choice of eating outside Mooney if we want to. Similarly over hall rents subsidies would help those in hall\nbut leave those in private accommodation in acute difficulty. GRANTS CAMPAIGN STRATEGY Getting obsessed with subsidies can lead to wrong\nstrategy; namely, relying entirely on local militancy, in\na minority of colleges, to make the Government allow\nthese colleges to sub sid is e hall and refectory accounts.\nThis strategy \"guerilla struggle in the colleges\" would in\nfact not build the sort of mass movement, on a national\nscale that could win a grants increase. It would in effect\nexclude the majority of small colleges from the campaign and would run the risk that a number of unions\nwould face victim is ation. Support for the unions would\nthen be more difficult to build because of the lack of a national campaign already in existence.\nOn the other hand, by launching a National Campaign for higher grants N.U.S. has united the F.E. Students with the University students and students in\nhall with those in digs. The rent strikes, refectory boy-cot ts, occupations are an important part of this national campaign but must be seen in this context.\nThe outcome of meeting on Thursday, between NUS and the Government about grants is bound to anger a lot of students. Mr. St. John Stevas agreed with the justice of virtually every point in the claim (except the annual review)! The Government figures on the decline\nin purchasing power of the grant tallied with those of\nN.U.S. they agreed that an increasing number of students suffered real hardship and in general the ultimate\npoint in reasoned negotiation was reached\u2014viz \"be-cause of the economic situation, we cannot afford it,\"\nbut they want more time to think about it! Question\u2014\nhow can they afford the 11 per cent increase in defence\nexpenditure?\nThe Government had the first interim claim a year\nago, January, and the present claim with all the figures four months ago. ft clearly taxed the organisational\npower of the D.E.S. to the limit to actually arrange a meeting with N.U.S. \u2014too much to expect them to give\nan answer! No, we've got to wait! And maybe since\nstudents are \"notoriously fickle\" the present grants campaign will just fade away.\nIt's rather interesting that the Government did not\nhave the basic animal cunning to put forward a small\ndivisive offer, as seemed likely\u2014maybe that is still to\ncome. Other points of interest, according to Digby\nJacks, are firstly that St. John Stevas was not very well\nbriefed particularly on the cost of abolishing the parental contribution and secondly that he said he was sympathetic to the student case but the economy, the pub-li c.M.P.' s, local authorities. Mrs. Thatcher, Ted Heath\nthe civil service etc. etc.\" were the problem. That is\neveryone was to blame except Our Norman.\nWell, at least, we know they cannot meet us in a straight argument\u2014our case is solid. They seem to be\npissing about, playing for time. The only thing to do\nis hit them hard on March14 th. Every student in I.C. should be on \"strike\" that day in a really massive\ndemonstration that we are not complaining about\ngrants because it's \"the latest fun thing to do.\" We\ndemand that our claim is taken seriously.\nOur postion has changed completely in the last de-cade. If anyone still thinks students are privileged, this\nepisode should shatter their illusions. We have been\nput in exactly the same position as the millions of workers in dispute just now, health service workers, civil\nservants, Ford workers, train drivers, nurses, gas work-ers, teachers; in the same position as the old age pen-sion ers. We are being told that no matter how just our\ncase is\u2014no deal! The defence increase and tax-cuts\nfor the rich come first.\nSurely it is stating the obvious to say that all the\nsections hit by the Government freeze should support\neach other? As yet we have done far too little to win\nthat support from either trade unionists or old-age pen-sion ers. MARCH14 th After last Thursday'sU. G.M. there will no doubt be\ngreat confusion about the March14 th Day of Action.\nCouncil, last week agreed nem. con. to back the strike\nand so the Executive and the Grants Action Committee can go ahead and organise things. A teach-in on\n\"Education in the '70's\" in the Great Hall, mass public\nleafleting in Oxford Street in the afternoon a street\ntheatre and disco in the evening are all planned. The\ndelegate lobby of Parliament can be organised.\nThe U. G.M. was, of course in quo rate by the time\nthe vote on the strike motion was taken. 240 members\nwere present and when a vote was taken only four voted\nagainst. Presumably, the high tension of the hustings\ntook its toll of the other 300 who were at the best attending General Meeting this year but drifted away\nafter Mooney. Clearly we need a well attended E.G. M. next Friday, 12.45\u2014Great Hall to take the final dec i sion. Meantime petitions are available for each class to\nrequest the support of its lecturers by postponing their\nlectures. Many of the staff support the grants claim and\nwe should have no hesitation in asking them to help us\nin this way.\nThe March14 th action is on it's up to you to make\nit a decisive rejection of the Government delaying tac-tics!\nNote: Next Grant's Action Committee\u20145.00. Today\u2014Committee Room A. White Paper\n(cont'd from page 3)\nthe axe; after all. nobody\nreally likes students (es-pec i ally after Stirling) and\nmost people like babies.\nThe 10 per cent increase\nin the defence budget also means economies have\nto be made somewhere.\nThe first effect of the\ngovernment's proposals\non Universities will be to\nreduce the number of\nplaces available, thus\nmaking entry more difficult and strengthening\nthe binary system. Places\nwill be reduced by reducing the universities' financing. This has many other effects besides simply\ncutting numbers of stud-ents.\nThe quality of education will decline, for staff/\nstudent ratios are to be\ncut from 8:1 to 10:1. And not only will there be less\nteachers to go round, but\nthose that there are will\nbe. on average, older \u2014\nreductions will be made\nby cutting recruitment.\nCutting back is indeed\nthe prime motive of the\nproposals \u2014 research student numbers arc to cut\nback too. The reduction\nin supervisors for undergraduates thus implied\nwill have to be met from\nteaching staff, who'll have\nless time for their research\nIt's a shame they don't spend more time on their\nresearch anyway, since so\nmany of them are such\nuseless teachers and are\ntotally uninterested\nteaching.\nin\nOne of the most important innovations of the\nWhite Paper is the Diploma of Higher Education,\na two-year course with Alevel entry. This would be\ngreat if it was intended\nas a foundation course,\nsince so many students go\nto college for nebulous\nreasons forced upon them\nby head teachers and\ntheir staff with their own\nminds undecided. If it\nwere possible for students\nto make up their minds\non a degree course bearing in mind their experience on a Dip HE course\nthe latter would be val u able; but the government\nsee it as a two-year terminal qualification, designed to satisfy the demand for higher education and to reduce still\nfurther student numbers.\nBut do they save in the\nlong run? Their cuts can\nonly prove detrimental to\neducation as a whole. You may adopt the attitude of\n\"I'm all right. Jack. I 've\nbeen to university, so\nwhat?\" But education\nshapes our society \u2014 a poor standard of education for all means a poor\nsociety for all. We must\nalways bear the future in\nmind.\n(based on an article by\nJoy Clancy, President of\nUL U, written for the\nL SPA). "

That is how Dr. Levy,\nChairman of the Refectory Committee, summed up the situation regarding the infestation\nof the kitchens by mice at Thursday's Refectory Committee meeting.\nThe meeting was told that it would be necessary\nto spend \u00a33,350 to disinfect the refectory areas of\ncockroaches and mice. This sum included \u00a31.250 for\nsteam cleaning and \u00a31,000\nfor washing down walls.\nThe committee, which\nlast year contemplated the\nthen cost of \u00a32,500 as\nabove their ceiling, is now\nprepared to pay this and\nget the kitchens properly\ncleaned.\nCockroaches are apparently fairly easy to get\nrid of, but tend to become\nresistant to the poisons\nused fairly rapidly, so they\nhave to be changed at\nfrequent intervals. Apparently Mr. Mooney and his\nstaff are already achieving\nsome considerable success\nin combating cockroaches.\nA bigger problem arises\nwith mice. There are no\npoisons which can be used\nwhere food is prepared,\nthe meeting was informed.\nWithout mentioning the\npossibility of the college\ninvesting in a few hundred\ncats. Dr. Levy drew the\nmeeting's attention to the\nwidespread mouse problem in Kensington. At the\nmoment, by comparison\nwith other places, fC is\nhardly affected, but the\nsituation will have to be\nwatched carefully. Other\nareas of the college are\nequally infested, if not to\na worse extent, including\nhalls of residence.\nPRICES TO STAY STABLE The finance sub-com-mitte e reported that although turnover this year\nwas projected to be almost\ndouble that of last at\n\u00a3307,000, the refectories\nwere likely to incur a loss\nof the order of \u00a39,000. It\nwas agreed that \u00a36,500 of\nthis could be met from re-serves, and the remainder\nfrom profits on wine sales,\nwhich this year should\namount to about \u00a34,000.\nBar profits, estimated at\napproximately \u00a310,000, are\nto be spent on completely\nrefurbishing Southside Bar.\nIf current trends con-tin ue, no price increases\nwill be necessary before\nthe end of the financial\nyear, on31 st July. It will\nthen almost certainly be\nnecessary to raise prices\nsince wages are expected\nto rise steeply in the interim. V.A.T. ABSORBED The \"college bars are to\nabsorb V.A.T. until the\nend of July, when the\nsituation can be assessed.\nIt is certain that V.A.T. will be levied once this\nperiod is over. The only\nproblem with bars at the\nmoment is that not enough\nWatney's Beer is being\ndrunk: the bars are on an\nagreement to down 400\nbarrels a year in order\nto reap the benefits of an\nimprovements loan.\nThe famous Mooney cockroach as captured by a Felix photographer\nduring the last scare in January 1970\nPortrait of a Catering Manager\nSo Victor paid one of his little visits to a Union meeting for ate tea te te with the boys and girls. It's not the first time it's happened and it\nwon't be the last.\nMooney's been a source of abuse ever since he arrived at IC many\nyears ago and a sort of legend has evolved around this man who has\ndone more than anything to add a bit of colour to the lives of all who\nhave trodden the journey of a lifetime through the technological pathos\nof IC and the hallowed, mal-coloured pathways to Moonev's culinary\ndelights\u2014more than anything to add a bit of colour to the very media\nyou are now investigating.\nIn my short overstay at IC Felix has been embossed with real life\nph o ties of\n\u2014the famous \"Mooney hairy chip\u2014hairier, more grotesque, than\nyou have ever seen before, looks not unlike a spider with an enormous\nwooden leg or some such organ (improvise, Mike)\".\n\u2014the magnificent \"Mooney cockroach\u2014bigger and better and more\nlife-like than ever your wildest nightmares imagined.

I was forced\nto go there.)\".\nMooney's had all this. Often it was the only thing capable of stirring\nIC'sse ne scent students from their slide rules and Coulson and Richardson, Vol 3. Every society needs a scapegoat and Mooney's been IC's since records began. Not that he's suffered from the experience. He's developed a fine art in fending off questions like some dispassionate\nobserver. Listening to his Union meeting offerings it seemed hardly\ncredible that he has any responsibilities towards IC catering at all.\nBut the questions have improved too. Rob. Armitage pestered him\nenough to be ICU's next secretary. (Did you like those phosphorescent\nmaroon and purple posters for Allnut and Armitage?

The only comparable re fec at IC is the Union, you sav, in\nterms of numbers, and you're trying to close that because it's \"not\nviable\". But RCA's viable. But no doubt they've got a different scape-goat.\ncontinued on page 2\nUNION\nMEETING\nANGRY\nAT\nEVASIVE\nMOONEY\nMr. Mooney, College\nCatering Manager, and\nDr. Levy, Chairman of the\nRefectory Committee,\ncame to the Union Meeting on Thursday to state\ntheir case and answer\nquestions from the meet-ing. Dr. Levy started the\nmeeting by outlining the\nfinancial position of the\nrefectories this year as a comparison with last, and\nquestions were then\nthrown up from the floor.\nThe main grumbles were\nwith prices, only a few\nwith quality. The meeting\nseemed to be com in ced that prices had been put\nup, and Mr. Mooney's evasive answers did nothing\nto alleviate their fears. He claimed no knowledge of\nprice disparities between\nrefectories, and said\nthat they all operated to\na standard duplicated list\nwhich had been current\nsince the Ist August.\nWhen told last week (un-til it was taken down)\nthere was a new price list\nagainst the old one with\nprice differentials he again\nclaimed ignorance.\nHe claimed that price\ndisparities occurred only\nwhen cashiers got mud-d led, and that price \" in creases\" which occurred\nthis way should be reported to him. He told the\nmeeting that students must\nbe their own watchdogs on\nprices and overcharging.\nWhen charged that his\nquality and value for money was poor by comparison with the Royal College\nof Art, he attempted to\nshrug this off by simply\nstating that they were\nsmaller. While they dealt\nwith about three or four\nhundred dinners at lunch-time, College Block or\nSouthside each had about\n1200 customers.\nMr. Mooney's general\naim seemed to be to pass\non the blame and responsibility to others. Price \" in creases\" are the fault of\ncashiers overcharging, the\ncontinuance of the habit\nis the fault of students not\ncomplaining, and the fault\nfor the bad quality of the\nfood lies with the ref ect or tories having too many\ncustomers.\n\n"

The idea behind the inauguration of the Board\nwas to crystalize the efforts of its constituent organisations to their mutual advantage and for the benefit of the students of Imperial College. Ents, this\nyear has been an outstanding financial success and assuming they continue in this vein in coming years\nthen it was felt that their excess should be used\nto benefit the entertainment of smaller minority\ngroups within the college and so to provide a more\ncomprehensive spectrum of entertainment. It was furthermore felt that the financing of these smaller\nclubs through bodies such as RC C was slightly out\nof place when it was grouped with what may be\ncalled\" noncompetitive sports clubs\". Many students who have been consulted have\nexpressed concern that clubs like Dram Soc would become purely entertainment and thus lose their\nfunction and value as cultural and recreational\nclubs. There is provision in the constitution of\nSCAB to prevent just this kind of situation occurring and the Board itself will ensure that this does''\nnot happen.\nThe Board will also be used, and has the facility\nto put the co-operation between interested parties\non a formal footing. The Board is not allowed to\ninterfere with the internal running of the constituent\norganisations. It is important to note at this point\nthat the Ents committee has the same standing on\nThe Board as all the other clubs. Their Junior Treasurer will sit on the board, in addition to their\nchairman, for the very simple reason that they will handle the most money.\nThe Board will be chaired by the Social Secretary\nwho will represent the Board on Council and will NOT have the same job or function as the present\nEnts chairman. His job will be to supervise the coordination of the organisations on the Board and to\nsupervise the division of the money which in the\nfirst instance will be derived from the Union Finance\nCommittee along with the Senior Treasurer of the\nBoard. He will not be directly involved in the organisation of events and will ensure that the aims of\nthe various societies on the Board are not interfered with directly by the Board. The chairman of the Constituent College Union Entertainment Committees will sit on the Board to advise and to consult, but the CC U's will not\nderive any financial benefit directly from the Board.S CAB has been criticised already and will be\ncriticised again but hopefully it will improve entertainment facilities and communication in Imperial\nCollege but it is stressed that it may only advise\nand not interfere directly with its constituent organisations which include IC Ents Committee.

After another of their joy-rides\nwhen the coach got lost \u2014 because Heineken, who\nhad the directions, went by car \u2014 we finally took the\nfield half-an-hour late. After dominating the first five\nminutes, IC quickly ran out of steam and let Ashford\nin for two goals in the first half. The second half was\nfairly even with the only goal being scored by Ash ford. However, IC deserved more in this half especially\nin one goal mouth melee when Ashford successfully\nused everything to stop a goal.\nOn Wednesday Southampton gave ICa hard, fast,\nbut scrappy, game. It ended in a11 draw \u2014 Colin Dyer scoring from the edge of the circle, after good\nwork by Jag Gahir. Not much can be said about\nWessex's goal except that Sid Boulton had a hand in\nit.\nIC Mixed XIv Royal Vets Mixed XII C4 Royal Vets 3\nAfter a very close game last Sunday, IC Mixed team retained their unbeaten record, but were lucky\nto do so. Vets fielded a strong side and were very\nconfident of victory (cocky b....s). To counter this\nIC produced yet another secret weapon \u2014 they had\ntwo Wonder Boys in their side. Vets had the better\nof the first quarter of the match and eventually scored\na well taken goal. This stirred IC into action and they\neventually took a21 half time lead, both goals coming from short corners. The first was from WB(1) trickier \u2014 the goalkeeper was fooled by the pace of the\nshot \u2014 and the second from a Julie creak er.IC added\na third early in the second half following aWB(1) \u2014\nWB(2) move which resulted in WB(2) scoring. Unfortunately Vets were then allowed to equalise from two\ndefensive mistakes and could have gone into the lead\nfrom any of the many chances they created. Instead,\nit was IC who scored the winner, through WB(2),\nlate in the game.\nThe following people were known to be present:\u2014\nRichard, Bob, Julie, Jacqui, Junior, Chris, Blossom,\nWB(2), Villis, WB(1) an unnamed umpire.\nIC2 nd XIv Ashford 2nd XII C2 Ashford 1\nThe result of Saturday's match showed that the age\nof miracles is not yet over. There was a certain amount\nof confusion before the match caused by the very late\narrival of some of the IC side (will culprits please take\nnote). When the match eventually started, Ashford\nstormed into IC territory and remained there continually for all the first half.\nHowever, thanks to some inept shooting and inspired\ngoal keeping by Jerry Heffer, Ashford did not score.\nIn fact it was IC who scored first with a brilliant\nbreakaway goal midway through the second half. A Mike Vie yr a clearance found Chris Tyler on the left\nwing. The ball was then worked across the centre,\nleaving Dave Neal with just the goalkeeper to beat,\nwhich he did with ease. Almost immediately 1C added\na second when a long clearance was chased through\nby Dave Neal. At the sight of this, the goalkeeper\ntook fright and kicked the ball into his own net.\nThough Ashford eventually scored at the very end of\nthe match, they never looked like obtaining an equal-is er.

It sem s to smack of\nwheeling and dealing by shadowy contact men at\na high rate of interest: we think of stockbrokers\nand their belts, bowler hats and plump pink fingers:\nand there is Bismarck's 'honest broker' which he,\nsomehow, turned into a phrase meaning just the\nopposite. And then there are pawnbrokers, who\nseem to give another down-turn to the picture we have of all brokers.\nAll of which crossed our mind when talking\nto FELIX FINANCIALLY's adviser, Derek E. Cummings. He, as readers of this column will know,\nis a broker. As readers of this column will also\nknow, he has been pretty good at putting other\npeople under the microscope in past issues and in\nmaking such as mortgage company managers, bank\nmanagers and the like explain what they are about.\nSo it seemed a reasonable idea to cross-examine\nhim for a change and get his views on what his job\nout to be about.\nIt has to be admitted, of course, that Cummings\ndoes not exactly fit the images we talked about\nabove, since he is one of the mavericks of the\nbusiness herd\u2014the kind of blok e who calls a spade\na bloody shovel.\nAnyway, we sat him down and fired off a few\nquestions. It went like this:\u2014\nFELIX: What is a broker?\nDEC: Basically, a go-between. A man whose job\nit is to act as the connection between a problem and its best solution. In terms of\ninsurance, the broker should examine what\nthe need is and obtain the best possible insurance cover at the cheapest possible rate,\nWhether the problem is the insuring of a ship's hull or a housemaid's knee. There's always a good, efficient way of doing it \u2014\nand many inefficient, expensive, wasteful\nways of doing it. A good broker will find\nthe best way.\nFELIX: So a broker is really a kind of middle man? DEC: Let's make no bones about it. A broker is\na parasite on the body of a vast and important industry. But having said that let's remember that parasites have their uses. In\npractical terms, a good broker can save you a lot of money. And I'm not talking, necessarily about a businessman who wants to\ninsure his factory. I'm talking about people\nlike yourselves \u2014 students. A good broker\ncan save you money \u2014 perhaps by doing\nnothing. I 've spoken before about being very\nwary of buying insurance from the salesman\nWho come round here trying to flog policies\nto people who don't need them. Well, a good broker might well advise you not to\nbuy anything because you don't need it.\nFELIX: From the experience of many students, there\n\u2022do not seem to be many in the insurance\nbusiness Who think like that.\nDEC: That's quite true. Most brokers \u2014 and I do mean most \u2014 are perfectly content to\nearn their bread by selling policies which are advantageous to the insurance company\nand to themselves without giving as much as a damn about the client.\nFELIX: How are brokers paid?\nDEC: They are paid a percentage, either of the\npremiums on the policies they sell, or on\nthe s ilm assured.\nFELIX: The more they sell, the more they get?\nDEC: Of course. And that's why a great many\nbrokers are quite unscrupulous. It really\nmakes me mad ta see how easy it is for\na lazy broker to sell insurance. After all, insurance is a hazy sort of thing and the\nmajority of people who buy it \u2014 and that's most people \u2014 have very little idea what they want or what they need. It's like selling sweets 'to children. You can get away\nwith almost any old rubbish, and I might\nsay that most insurance companies do just\nthat. They actually depend on the public not\nknowing one policy from another. They\nmake very fat profits from public ignorance\nand the pity of it is that a lot of people in\nmy profession simply aid and abet them in\ndoing so.\nFELIX: Can you give an example?\nDEC: Easily. Let's assume you feel you need\nlife assurance, and that you bowl along to\na broker to fix it up for you. Alright, what\nwill the lazy broker do? He'll introduce you to an insurance company and together they'll\nsell you an endowment policy, which is the\npolicy where you pay for, say, twenty-five\nyears. If you kick the bucket, they'll pay\nyour beneficiary and you couldn't care less\nanyway. If you live they'll promise to pay\nyou back a lot more than you have actually\ncontributed. Sounds fine. But there are two\nfactors to be mindful of. One, that what\nindividual companies will pay you can vary\nhalf as much again of the total premiums\nto twice as much. It depends on which insurance company you pick. Secondly, all the glossy talk about big returns at the end of twenty-five years has to be set against\nthe real fact that it 'is taking the country\nonly about ten years to halve the purchasing power of your money. In other words, even the very best return on an endowment\nis a very poor and inefficient form of using\nyour cash. Now, no insurance company in\nthe world will ever tell you that. And neither\nwill the lazy, greedy broker. But I'm a bro-ker. And I say it as often as I can. FELIX: So far, it seems clear that brokers simply\nadd to the cost of insurance. Wouldn't we all be better off without them?\nDEC: A good question, but the implication is not\nquite accurate. If all brokers were abolished,\ninsurance companies would simply have to\nemploy armies of salesmen to take their\nplaces. Life assurance has to be sold. Al most all other forms of insurance are\nbought, but with life cover, the public has\nto be conditioned into buying it. That's why it is so wide open to advertising methods\nwhich border on the dishonest. No,I don't think brokers add to the cost of insurance.\nIt's just that many of them go along with\nthe insurance companies and their misleading advertising and con people into paying\nmore than they need to for things they don't really want.\nFELIX: OK, what about the good broker. What does\nhe do? DEC: A good broker will first look into his client's affairs and see what need he has of insurance \u2014 if any. If there is a need, he will\nshop around the companies with whom he\nhas contact and he will find the best cover\nat the cheapest rate. Remember, insurance\nis a positive and necessary factor in many\nsituations. Life cover for the man with a family, for example, provides protection for\nhis dependants in the event of his death.\nThat's good. But there are numerous ways of going about it.\nFELIX: But is it likely that a broker will risk red uci ng his rake-off when, after all, the\nclient isn't likely to complain since he will have little idea of the alternatives.\nDEC: It's not likely that the greedy broker will take any such risk. But then, he is a shortsighted blok e anyway. On the other hand,\nmy own philosophy is that if you give a man good advice and a good deal at the out-set, he'll very likely come back to you when he really needs you. I 've got clients now I first met here at IC. Some of them I advised to go away and forget about in sur ance. They didn't need it \u2014 and they didn't need me, at the time. But when they did have a need, they came back to me and I was highly pleased. I'd established a trust, and that is a broker's most valuable\nasset, in my view.\nFELIX: Why, would you say, do people need a brok-er's advice?\nDEC: Because there is a very good chance that\nit will save them money in the long run. After all, you don't pay the broker. The insurance company does that if and when business is done. Furthermore, a broker can thread his way through the jungle of insurance whereas the ordinary man couldn't hope to. There are upwards of 1 5 0 insurance\ncompanies on the market for a start. It's quite likely that any individual's needs are\nbest served by using several different companies. After all, no one company can hope\nto offer the best deal for every single insurance situation. One might be good for life\ncover, another best at for car cover, an other for house content insurance. They\ntend to specialise. So to put all your business with one company could we l be wasteful and costly. But an experienced broker\nwill know Which is best for what and will advise accordingly.\nFELIX: It seems likely, then, that some insurance\ncompanies would have no great love for\nbrokers \u2014 especially those who advise their\nclients to buy the cheapest policies.\nDEC: That's not entirely true. Insurance comp an ies want to sell policies, full point. Of course, there are some who employ thousands of salesmen and collectors rather than\nrely on brokers. This is simply because no\nself-respecting broker would dream of using\nthem. They give the public a rotten deal\n\u2014 and they know it. Companies like that\nare prime examples of trading on public\nignorance. They're bandits. And they are\namong the richest insurance companies in\nthe land.\nFELIX: You' ve spoken a lot about life assurance.\nThat is, we know, the most important aspect\nof the business. But what about other things.\nIs brokerage advice imp or ant there?\nDEC: I think so. There are just as many traps and pitfalls in other kinds of insurance as there\nare in life cover.\nFELIX: For instance?\nDEC: Alright, suppose you get married and you buy your spouse a diamond ring. It's worth\ntwo hundred quid, but you insure it for only\na hundred to save a few shillings on the\npremium. It gets stolen and you ring your\ninsurance company and tell them your two hundred pound ring has been nicked. Now, you might think they'd pay out the hundred\nyou insured it for without argument. You' d be wrong. They'll pay you only fifty. Their\nreasoning is that you insured it for only half\nits real value and thereby forced the company to carry a greater risk than they knew\nabout \u2014 because, it being twice as val u able, it was more likely to be pinched.\nTherefore, they reason if you only insured\nhalf the risk, they1!! only pay half the sum insured. It's complicated, but there is a kind\nof logic in it. Now, if you had been in that\nsituation, wouldn't 'it have been worth getting it insured properly, by using the expert\nadvice of a broker?\nFELIX: It seems to us that the insurance companies\nhave us all by the balls.\nDEC: They will have if you let them. My job is to\nprotect my clients from that most uncomfortable risk.\n\n"
