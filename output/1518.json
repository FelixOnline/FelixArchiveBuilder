    "content": "FILM\nFELIX Friday 18 MAY 2012 23\nSoapy, sappy, sleepy shadow\nJohn Park\nDirectors Tim Burton\nScreenwriters Seth Grahame-Smith,\nJohn August, Dan Curtis\nCast Johnny Depp, Eva Green,\nMichelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham\nCarter, Jackie Earle Haley, Jonny Lee\nMiller, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, Gulliver\nMcGrath\nDark Shadows\nStop right now, thank you very much, I need somebody with the human blood\nFor a vampire who was cursed and\nburied alive in the late 1760s, the year\n1972 is understandably a strange and\nmysterious world. This is the challenge\nthat Barnabas Collins (Depp) is faced\nwith. Born to rich parents who own a\nlarge fishing business as well as their\nown Collinswood Manor, Collins in his\nyouth makes the mistake of having a\nshort fling with the dangerous and jealous witch Angelique (Green). Failing\nto return her love, he irks the talented\nsorceress and finds out there is nothing scarier than a woman scorned. First\nmanipulating his true love to fall off a\ncliff, she transforms him into a vam-pire, forcing him to suffer the loss of\nhis loved one forever. Turning the torch\nand pitchfork-wielding villagers against\nhim, she succeeds in burying him alive.\nHis freedom comes nearly 200\nyears later when a group of construction workers accidentally break him\nout of his coffin, and incidentally all\nget sucked dry by the thirsty vampire.\nAfter a few comical confrontations he\nshares with modern developments he\nadvantage of, as Barnabas learns that it\nis possible for women to become doc-tors, and 15-year-olds do not generally\nget married and become pregnant despite the fullness of their childbearing\nwomb. He also insists The Carpenters\nare not singers but individuals dealing\nwith woods. In the gothic setting of its\nrun-down mansion, impossibly white-powdered stars, and constant shots of\nthe death-inviting cliff and the waves\ncrashing into sharp rocks to remind\nus of a foreboding future, Burton finds\ntime for humour, mostly centred around\nthe shock Barnabas encounters as he\nstarts experiencing a completely different world.\nBut there is a drastic shift in tone as\nAngelique enters the picture. The comedy is tragically cut short, and we enter\nan even weirder femme-fatale, Fatal\nAttraction-esque love-hate interaction\nbetween the vampire and the witch.\nThe icy Depp and fiery Green make\nan interesting pair at first, but once it\nbecomes clear that there is really nothing further to develop between the two\ncharacters, even the wild \u201csex\u201d scene\nin which the two of them fly and crash\naround Angelique\u2019s office for some passionate hugging (that\u2019s all they do) to a\nclassic Barry White song, feels stale.\nAlthough Green looks the part of an\nunforgiving wench, her powerful witch\ndoesn\u2019t have much to do. She acts as\nthe tough CEO of her company, but she\nnever makes the adequate villain, and\nit\u2019s a wonder why anyone needs to be\nafraid of her. Given the large cast full of\nfamiliar names, hardly anyone is given\nproper attention to, and among the most\nwasted of the ensemble is Carter, who\nis barely seen, does hardly anything\nmemorable, and is tossed aside, never to\nbe seen again. Miller is also given virtually no time to shine, and he too, is\ngone in a rushed subplot. The two children remain insignificant throughout,\nwhether it\u2019s the rebellious Caroline or\nthe innocent David.\nMaking something out of her supporting role is the divine Pfeiffer who,\nas the strong head of household, adds a\ntouch of class and glamour to the cast,\nand as the only character who has any\nsubstantial relationship with Collins,\nPfeiffer strongly holds her own, and she\nalso doesn\u2019t look too shabby confidently\nprotecting her home and family from\ninvaders with a shotgun.\nBurton tries to manage a lot of genres\nhere, but whilst doing so, he cannot\nquite grasp a single one correctly. Is this\na comedy? A gothic horror? Supernatural fantasy? He dabbles with far more\nthan he can handle, which can also be\nsaid for the underused cast he has as-sembled. Dark Shadows remains faithful to Burton\u2019s well-known and praised\nvisual flair, but the content never stays\nstrong throughout, and the overblown\nending with its sudden necessity to\nproduce some kind of a happy ending is a bit of a letdown. Still, Depp is\nas impressive as ever, proving there is\nno contemporary actor who can come\nclose to skillfully tackling the roles he\ndoes on a regular basis.\nis not at all familiar with, such as the\nbig letter M signalling a McDonald\u2019s\nrestaurant, and his careful mistrust of\nthe newly laid-down concrete road, he\nmakes his way back to Collinswood,\nonly to discover his beloved mansion\nalmost in ruins. The residents include\nhis four descendants, Elizabeth (Pfei-ffer), her brother Roger (Miller), Elizabeth\u2019s daughter Caroline (Moretz) and\nRoger\u2019s son David (McGrath), their\nbutler Willie (Haley), family psychiatrist Dr. Julia Hoffman (Carter), a very\nold nanny (Ray Shirley) whose purpose\nthroughout the film isn\u2019t entirely clear,\nand finally the new family governess\nVictoria (Bella Heathcote).\nDespite her reserved feelings for inviting a vampire into her home, the\nfamily matriarch Elizabeth welcomes\nthe return of her ancestor, and fills him\nin on what he\u2019s missed over the past\ntwo centuries. Basically, the fishing\nbusiness Barnabas\u2019 parents worked so\nhard to build is no more, ever since Angelique the cursing witch took over almost everything, exacting vengeance on\na family she despises. Always putting\nhis bloodline first, Barnabas swears\nto restore their business to its former\nglory, and so begins the Collins family\u2019s extreme makeover backed by the\n70s megahit, The Carpenters\u2019 \u2018Top of\nthe World.\u2019\nSo far, Dark Shadows looks and\nsounds like an offbeat comedy in\nwhich the goofy and stiff Depp does\nand says the oddest things.

    "content": "A Kenyan scientist and a Gambian clothes\ndesigner have joined forces to fashion a garment that has the power to repel mosquitoes\nand beat malaria.\nThe one-piece multi-coloured bodysuit\ncomes with an anti-mosquito mesh hood and a\ncape that contains mosquito repellent that has\nbeen bonded with the fabric\u2019s fibres at the molecular level.\nBecause the repellent is embedded in the garment\u2019s fabric using nanotechnology it does not\ndissipate like regular skin-based insecticides,\naccording to the scientist and clothes designer\nfrom Cornell University in New York.\nThe \u2018binding technology\u2019 even allows up to\nthree times more insecticide to be embedded\nwithin the fabric compared to normal sleeping nets, which are only dipped in solution and\nusually need to be replaced or re-dipped every\nsix months.\nMalaria, which is endemic in large parts of\nAfrica, is a killer parasitic disease transmitted\nto humans through the bite of infected mosqui-toes. It kills more than half a million people\nevery year. In Africa, a child dies from malaria\nevery minute.\nThe creators of the hooded bodysuit, Frederick Ochanda and Matilda Ceesay, have both\nwitnessed family members fall ill with malar-ia. They hope that their innovative design will\ninstigate further technological advances in the\nbattle against Malaria.\nScientists are already working on a fabric\nthat can potentially detect changes in temperature or light and so can secrete the amount of\nrepellent needed accordingly. This would, for\nexample, provide more protection at night\nwhen most mosquitoes prefer to feed.\nAt the very least, Ochanda and Ceesay hope\nthat the technology can be used to craft stron-ger, longer lasting and more effective insecti-cide-treated bed nets.\n\u201cAlthough there are already mosquito nets\nbeing used, the solution isn\u2019t foolproof,\u201d Ceesay said, speaking at Cornell University.\nFashion to fight malaria\nA promising way to power vehicles and appliances in the future is through use of hydrogen\nfuel cells. These, however, require a source of\nhydrogen to work, and obtaining this hydrogen\nhas typically been an expensive process.\nThe most common method to obtain the gas\nis to split water into oxygen and hydrogen.\nThis is an operation that requires a catalyst,\nand the catalyst must be such that it reduces\nthe energy necessary for the reaction to occur\nas much as possible. The lower the energy that\nis required, the more efficient the system, because it means there is more energy left over to\nactually power your system. Hence, platinum\ncatalysts are often used due to their excellent\ncatalytic ability.\nA problem with platinum, however, is its\never-rising cost: something that has been seen\nwith many rare metals as their availability\nbecomes ever reduced. Hence, alternatives involving cheaper catalysts are needed, and researchers at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York have developed a promising\ncandidate.\nOne of the best features about platinum is its\nhigh electron density. A cheaper catalyst, nick-el, does not have such a high density, though\nthis can be alleviated somewhat using mo-lybdenum. This alloy still, however, will not\nproduce the required level of catalytic ability.\nA proposed solution was to add nitrogen to alter the electronic state of the alloy, which has\nbeen proven to work in the macroscale. In the\nnanoscale, it was found that applying nitrogen\nvia exposure to an ammonium environment\ncaused 2D nanosheets to form. These sheets\nhave a greater catalytic ability thanks to the\nincreased surface area, and hence the mixture\nhas a catalytic ability similar to that of plati-num, but with a reduced cost.\nAs well as providing a cheaper yet effective method to produce hydrogen, this research is significant for seeing the production\nof nanosheets, when only nanoparticles were\nexpected. As nanosheets have an increased\nsurface area (and thus increased availability\nof reactive sites), this may lead to developing\neven faster catalysts using other materials. In\nthe aim to produce synthetic catalysts as fast\nas natural enzymes, such improvements are\nalways welcome.\nDOI: 10.1002/anie.201200699\nPhilip Kent\nFELIX\nFriday 18 may 2012\n10\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nSCIENCE\nIn brief\nZara Shubber\nA cheaper way to make hydrogen\nGet cape. Wear cape. Beat malaria...?\nNerve cells captured with Amos\u2019 mesolens\nBrad Amos, who contributed significantly to the\ndevelopment of the laser scanning confocal microscope while working at the Medical Research\nCouncil in Cambridge, has developed a new giant microscope, the \u2018Mesolens\u2019, that allows the\nimaging of an entire mouse embryo in subcellular\ndetail.\nAmos hopes that his new Mesolens could make\nimaging in developmental biology much simpler\nbecause the lens\u2019 huge field of view removes the\nneed to stitch many small images together, reducing image acquisition times from a day to an\nhour.\nThe confocal microscope, the current gold\nstandard in biomedical imaging, is successful\nbecause it allows biologists to obtain an image\nfrom inside a thick specimen, a technique known\nas optical sectioning. It does this in two steps:\nthe sample is illuminated with a small focused\nlaser spot; this spot is then focused onto a tiny\nhole placed in front of a camera. In this way, only\nlight that has come from the focused laser spot\ncontributes to the image. The laser spot is then\nscanned around to obtain a full image.\nTraditional microscope objective lenses in con-focal systems are small, which means that only\nsmall images can be obtained. To build an image of a 6mm object, hundreds of these small\nimages would need to be stitched together. To\nget around this, Amos had to make his lens half\na metre tall - ten or twenty times larger than a\nnormal microscope objective. In addition, some\nof the elements inside the lens need to be positioned within micrometer-accuracy.\nTo manufacture something so large this accurately is clearly not going to be easy. Despite\nthis, previous bad experiences with commercial\norganisations have led Amos to attempt to manufacture his giant lens in his own back garden. He\nhopes that the Mesolens will cost no more than\na commercial confocal microscope.\nThe first confocal images from the prototype\nMesolens were shown to the Royal Society in\nJanuary this year.\nJames Clegg\nInventor of confocal microscope\ndevelops new giant lens\nCornell University\nHydrogen car being filled up\n\u201cPeople are still getting sick and dying. We\ncan\u2019t get complacent. I hope my design can\nshow what is possible when you bring together\nfashion and science and will inspire others to\nkeep improving the technology.\u201d\nWant to write for Felix Science?\nEmail us...\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

As\npart of this process, we have identified specific abnormalities\nin cancer cells that make them very different from normal\ncells. Importantly, some of these changes (or mutations) in\ncancer cells make them resistant to the standard treatments,\nsuch as radiation and chemotherapy, that have been used for\nmany years. However, because cancer cells come to rely on\nthese mutations to allow them to survive, grow and spread,\nthey represent a potential weak spot in a tumour\u2019s defences.\nTherefore, by developing new drugs that attack cancer cells\nthrough their Achilles\u2019 heel, we may be able to improve the\neffects of radiotherapy in treating a range of tumour types. In\nthis lecture, I will discuss a number of examples that are\nalready allowing us to achieve better treatment results and will\nintroduce others that hold enormous promise for the future.\u201d\nDr Kevin Harrington, The Institute of Cancer Research\nIf you would like to join us for this lecture please RSVP to\nrcrlecture@rcr.ac.uk.

    "content": "MUSIC\nFELIX Friday 18 MAY 2012 21\nBreaking the frame\n\u00cd\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez de Rituerto dissects Surgeon\u2019s latest\nalbum ahead of his appearance at Bloc\nReviewed in 60\nseconds\nS\nurgeon has been a staple of the warehouse scene since his early involvement in the depths of techno at the\nturn of the 90s. His sound, and that\nof those he has influenced, is what\nyou might imagine tearing through the night\ndeep in between the concrete walls of some disused building. While the musical influences cited\ninclude industrial and krautrock pioneers such\nas Faust and Whitehouse, inspiration from the\nvisual and literary works of David Lynch and\nWilliam S. Burroughs are immediately apparent in the obsessive monotony and enveloping\npscyhoacoustics of his records.\nThis is endurance techno. The very essence that\ndefined the dance music underground. A blurry\nsoundtrack for questionable encounters on dark,\nsmokey dance floors. No sun glasses, no glow\nsticks, just the throbbing undertones of a stubborn kick drum and gargantuan bass. This is transcendental dance music for introverts. A dose for\nzealous party-goers who would rather stare at the\nbright light and let the sound consume them.\nYet with his Nth release and already 6th full-length album, Surgeon has done exactly what\nhe says on the tin, Breaking the Frame. More\nthan just a techno record, this is a document of\ntranscendence. The attested mold of heavy 4/4 is\nburied beneath an archaic craft of electro-acoustic\nmagnificence. The kick drums sound like smashing concrete blocks with your head. The harmon-ics, when they appear, are a tear through the heav-ens, somewhere between a burning sitar and a\ncrying machine. It is the sound of industrial music\npost-Blade Runner. If Gaspar No\u00e9\u2019s psychotropic\nepic Enter the Void were set in Mordor, you might\nhave found the Uruk-Hai pulling shapes to this.\nThe ominous atmosphere that permeates the\nhour is apparent from the start. After the generous introductory swathes of \u2018Dark Matter\u2019, track\ntwo sets off with a bassline that bubbles like an\noctopus throwing a tantrum. This weight which\nhas become such a signature of Surgeon\u2019s productions is also painfully apparent in the sparse\ntribal drum which runs throughout \u2018The Power of\nDoubt\u2019and in the cascading frenzy of \u2018Radiance\u2019.\nHowever, his inner ear for complex yet subtle\nrhythms has really expanded on this record, as\nhe delves in the space between the numerous\npolyrhythms which rear themselves the length of\na single track. Their juxtaposition with the pummeling 4/4 gives these instances room to breathe\nand melt into one another. This is best characterised by the first track on side C, \u2018Presence\u2019, which\nopens with a stuporous breath of a kick, before\nthe tantric cycles of an Oriental string instrument\nwraps around the listener like an enchanted snake\ndisappearing in fog.\nWhether he has sampled an Indian hurdy-gurdy\nor a Balinese gamelan or simply mirrored them in\nhis own studio remains a mystery.The sheer pres-enceofthesesoundsisoverwhelming.Theyseem\nto envelop you and take hold, removing you from\nyour physical environment and elevating you to\nsome other space. After the mesmerising cycles\nof \u2018Presence\u2019 disappear in a sudden drop, the 6\nminute interlude \u2018WeAreAlready Here\u2019disperses\nthe air in an unfamiliar cacophony of infinite bells\nand stained glass.\nThe closing track \u2018Not-Two\u2019is something of an\nopus. As if walking back into the piercing light\nafter an out of body trip, field recordings of bumper cars and arcade games in a carnival give you\na somewhat drunken feeling before they suddenly\ndisappear again under a blanket of drawn-out\nchoirs and eternal ringing. Scenes from the movie\nEnter the Void come back to mind. An inebriated\nintroduction to The Tibetan Book of the Dead, in a\nroom decorated by abstracted streaks of paint, just\nbefore another hit and a trip down the rabbit-hole.\nHonest Jon\u2019s Records have recently released\nthis EP and all the others from the Meet Shangaan Electro series on CD. Also featuring contributions from the likes of Actress and Oni Ayhun, these tracks lend a new light to the spirit\nof Shangaan, a ridiculously upbeat style of tribal\ndance music from Southern Africa.\nDemdike Stare deliver perhaps their most\nsober bass line to date, while the drums haunt\nlike a paranoia, reminding of midnight rituals involving the skulls of ancestors and very heavy\nliquids. The second take, or \u2018Version\u2019 in dub\ntalk, loses the drums in favour of more vexing\natmosphere, set by obsessive chants and distant birds.\nHype Williams\u2019s offering opens with a hypnotic\nreggae jerk under dropping drums. Not long after the first cries of Muscovite Inga Copeland,\nthe sleepy bassline falls and lulls the remainder\nof the track, amidst confessions of \u201cNever felt a\nday when I don\u2019t look back...\u201d\n\u00cd\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez de Rituerto\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nDemdike Stare/Hype\nWilliams\nMeet Shangaan Electro\n2012\nIn this, their third album, the Hackney based boys\nmove in a slightly different direction. Many of Portico Quartet\u2019s trademark sounds are used more\nsparingly; searing soprano saxophone lines riding\nover the blissful hang melodies are less prevalent than in Knee Deep in the North Sea or Isla,\nreplaced instead by various synthesised efforts.\nI think it was right for the band to move in this\ndirection as there was little room to manoeuvre\nwith the sound that they had forged on their first\ntwo albums. However the final product isn\u2019t quite\naccomplished to the level with which artists like\nBonobo fuse the organic with the electronic.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, this is a good album, but\nI\u2019m left wondering how good this could have been\nhad they really nailed the fusion of their amazing\nmusicianship with the extra dimension electonic\nnoises can bring.\nSimon Hunter\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nPortico Quartet\nPortico Quartet\n2012\nHMV Forum\nBe sure not\nto miss...\nWhite Denim\nWhite Denim are one of the best live\nbands around at the minute; the combination of their raucous garage rock\nand their Texan charm will definitely\nwin you over.

With scientific research being increasingly hindered by outside in-fluences, is it time to make an absolute\ndecision over what exactly can be published once and for all? Or would this\nbe detrimental to scientific advances?\nThe paper, containing methodology\nand data covering artificial generation\nof a strain of H5N1 avian flu, that has\nthe ability to transmit between mam-mals, was deemed initially unsuitable\nfor publication unless highly censored\nby the US National Science Advisory\nBoard for Biosecurity (NSABB) last\nNovember. However, such recommendation was only advisory; Nature still\nwent ahead with the publication in full,\nentitled \u201cExperimental adaptation of an\ninfluenza H5 HA confers respiratory\ndroplet transmission to a reassortant H5\nHA/H1N1 virus in ferrets.\u201d\nNature, a highly influential journal,\nstated after that \u201cA paper that omits\nkey results or methods disables subsequent research and peer review\u201d and\nas such, went ahead and published the\npaper as intended, with no censorship.\nThe paper itself justifies the research\nin the abstract, by explaining that now\nthe ability to create and recognise this\ntransmissible strain has been exercised\nin full, possible pandemics can be dealt\nwith as time effectively as possible.\nIssues involved were whether those\nwho repeat the investigation will be\nentirely safe in their attempts, and if\nthere is a possibility of it escaping a lab\nand infecting the public. The US Senate voiced its concerns over the extent\nto which the research could be used to\naid bioterrorism should it get into the\nwrong hands. Both concerns are justi-fied, but are the best solutions simply to\nkeep such information under wraps?\nThe World Health Organisation has\nbeen encouraged to release guidelines\nabout international standards for biosafety in laboratories, which hopefully\nwill minimise the risk of laboratory\nbased strains becoming dangerous, alA recent study published in the journal\nCell has identified a major genetic component of human brain development,\nwith implications for research into autism and schizophrenia. Scientists at\nThe Scripps Research Institute have\nfound that the gene SRGAP2, the protein product of which is responsible for\nforming neuronal connections in neo-cortical development, has undergone\ntwo human-specific truncated duplica-tions.\nOne of the duplicates has been named\nSRGAP2C, and appeared in the genome about 2.4 million years ago, during the time in which human lineage\nseparated from nonhuman primates\n(a related paper published in the same\nissue of Cell covers the recent evolution of SRGAP2). SRGAP2C interacts\nwith the original SRGAP2 to inhibit its\nfunctions, delaying the maturation of\ndendritic spines on pyramidal neurons.\nDendritic spines are crucial for integrating synaptic signals from other neurons.\nFar from having a negative effect\non brain development, SRGAP2C ultimately results in a higher density of\ndendritic spines on the neurons when\nthey mature \u2013 a human-specific trait.\nConditions like schizophrenia and autism in humans feature atypical neuro-nal connectivity; studying human-spe-cific gene duplications like SRGAP2C\nmay allow such diseases to be effectively modelled in mice, and unravel some\nof the mysteries surrounding these and\nother neurodevelopmental conditions.\nDOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2012.03.034\nBrainy gene\nFiona Hartley\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) is\nto lead a billion-euro mission to Jupiter and its icy moons. The Jupiter Icy\nMoons Explorer (JUICE) spacecraft is\nscheduled to launch in 2022, arriving in\nthe Jupiter system in 2030.\nA five-tonne satellite will be sent out\nto Jupiter in order to make a series of\nclose measurements of the giant planet\nand three of its moons: Ganymede, Callisto and Europa. The satellite, packed\nwith instruments, will take eight years\nto reach Jupiter, spend another three\nyears studying the system before crashing into the surface of Ganymede.\nUK researchers including Professor\nMichele Dougherty of Imperial College, lead scientist of the JUICE mis-sion, played a central role in gaining\napproval for the mission. The JUICE\nconcept was chosen over two other\nideas, NGO, which would place three\nhigh-precision satellites in space to detect gravitational waves, and Athena,\nGreen light for JUICE-y space mission\nSophia David\nPretty deadly: a transmission electron micrograph of the H5N1 virus (gold)\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\nthough no measures as of yet have been\nsuggested to counter possible bioterror-ist situations.\nThe same sort of dilemma came\nalongside stem cell research when it\nstarted to gain popularity. Eventual\nbans were placed in some countries\nsuch as Germany and Finland over embryonic stem cell use, despite results\nhaving long term potential to make a\nhuge difference in medicine. Although\nthe issues with stem cell research were\nethical as opposed to safety-related,\nboth situations highlight how the government can take control of scientific\nactivities and even halt them altogether.\nLegislation is made on a case by case\nbasis, but is it time a more universal set\nof laws were put into place to protect\nboth the ability to advance in science\nand the general public? Or is our scientific understanding expanding at such a\nrate that we can no longer predict what\nscenarios may arise in the future?At this\npoint, research and its consequences are\nvaried as different scientific discoveries\nspark different dilemmas, so perhaps a\nlaw that fits all is unrealistic. However,\nwith clashes between law and science\nincreasing in frequency, it seems that\nit may only be a matter of time before\nsomething has got to give.\nPhilippa Skett weighs up the pros and cons of publishing research on H5N1\nwhich would see the creation of the\nlargest X-ray telescope ever built.\nGanymede, Callisto and Europa are\nall suspected to harbour deep oceans\nof water below their icy crusts which\ncould be conducive to microbial life.\nTo investigate whether Jupiter and its\nmoons could provide habitable envi-ronments, JUICE will study the stormy\natmosphere of Jupiter and its magnetic\nand charged particle environment.\nHowever, the main focus will be on\nGanymede, the solar system\u2019s largest moon which is 8% larger than the\nplanet Mercury.

    "content": "T\nhroughout history a number of\ngreat artists have also been sci-entists. \u201cAnton Tchekhov himself\nwas a practicing physician\u201d Hassan Abdualrazzak, researcher at\nImperial College and playwright tells me in\nthe Junior Common Room at Imperial where\nwe met for the interview. He continues to say\nthat scientists make good playwrights due to\nthe huge analytical skills needed to write a\ngood script. This may go against the stereotype that scientists are rigorous, working only\nfrom hard facts while artists are eccentric, run\nby their emotions and impulses, however as\nmany before him Hassan has disproven this\nstereotype by remaining a successful scientist whilst producing award winning work.\nHis first play \u201cBagdad Wedding\u201d was wildly\npraised, premiering at London\u2019s Soho the-atre, and also reproduced by BBC Radio 3, as\nwell as in theatres in Sydney and New York.\nBagdad Wedding focuses on the lives of three\nprofessional Iraqis. The play moves between\nLondon and Bagdad where the wedding of\nthe main character, Salim, a doctor and writer\nof adult fiction is taking place. On the way to\nthe wedding Salim\u2019s cousins fire gunshots up\ninto the sky (a traditional occurrence at Iraqi\nweddings), attracting the attention of American soldiers. Believed to be a terrorist, Salim\nis captured and tortured. The play starts with\nSalim\u2019s death; his friend, Marwan, looks back\nat their relationship and how they met at Imperial College as students. Hassan tells me that\none of the scenes in the play takes place at the\nbase of Queen\u2019s Tower where Marwan and\nhis love interest Luma, an outgoing, energetic\nIraqi medical student, are talking about the\ntower and admiring it. Luma returns to Iraq after her father\u2019s death to practice medicine in an\nunder-equipped hospital. One of the themes in\nthe play is her adjusting to her new job which\nrequires her doing things such as putting on a\nhijab in order to fit in.\nThe main concern of the play, and possibly\nof Hassan\u2019s upcoming work in the depiction\nof his characters, which shows ordinary Iraqi\npeople educated, interested in art and leading seemingly normal lives, contradicts common beliefs and images from the media that\nonly show the disaster, tragedy and religious\nfanaticism. Hassan\u2019s characters drink, work,\nfall in love and have insecurities. They are\nseemingly alive and human in every possible\nmanner. The ability to capture the multiple\nlayers of humanity combined with telling\nhistory by depicting everyday life may be\nFELIX\nFriday 18 may 2012\n18\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts Editors: Will Prince\nEva Rosenthal\nARTS\nbelieve it I received a handwritten letter with\nhis home address printed on it!\u201d Hassan tells\nme with excitement. Having also included a\nsample of his writing in it, Hassan mentions\nthat Pinter\u2019s letter had been encouraging. He\nalso declares that he would like to write in a\nmore abstract manner, although his two upcoming plays are both realistic and political.\nThe first one he mentions is A Fire Blazing Brightly, a bigger, more \u201cepic\u201d play, once\nmore set between London and Iraq, that he\nhopes will be bought by one of London\u2019s\nlarger theatre companies. The second play,\ntitled The Prophet, and premiering on the\n14th of June at London\u2019s Gate Theatre came\nabout differently: artistic director, Christopher Haydon commissioned Hassan to write\na play about the \u201cArab Spring\u201d with Egypt\nas its focus. The international reputation of\nThe Gate is one of the main reasons for Haydon\u2019s choice of Hassan, as instead of bringing in and translating European plays, he had\nfound an international writer in the UK: \u201c I\nwas born in Prague, I grew up a little bit in\nBagdad, I grew up a little bit in Egypt, Nigeria\u2026 and then I came here. Because of my\nbackground, I \u2018qualify\u2019 for a theatre like The\nGate\u201d, Hassan explains.\nHassan continues by describing the plot\nof The Prophet and how he and Hayden had\nbounced ideas off one another until coming\nup with the concept of using the metaphor\nof a couple \u2013 Leila and Hisham \u2013 trapped in\ntheir marriage, to describe the situation in\nEgypt, a country trapped by Mubarak\u2019s rule\nand unable to move forward. The play follows a day in the life of this couple: that day\nis the 28th of January 2011, the start of the\nEgyptian revolution. According to Hassan;\n\u201cMost people say the revolution started on\nJanuary 25th, but the 25th was a small dem-onstration; on Friday 28th over one million\npeople came out on the street, and that\u2019s really when the revolution properly began.\u201d\nWho could have guessed that in the labs\nof Imperial such a theatre talent was hid-den? Hassan is not only ambitious and hard-working, he is also down to earth. As a treat\nfor the theatre enthusiasts at Imperial Hassan\nhas arranged discounted tickets; all you need\nto do is call up The Gate and say the word\n\u2018Iraq\u2019 to get a discounted ticket of \u00a310 until\nthe 28 June!\nThe Prophet runs at the Gate Theatre,\nNotting Hill, from 14 June to 21 July. See\nwww.gatetheatre.co.uk for more details.\none of the main reasons for his success as a\nplaywright.\nGrowing up in a family of academics and\nintellectuals Hassan thought his uncle, a\nnovelist, to have the most interesting job of\nall. As a child he had seen the uncle work\non old typewriters, manuscripts being almost\nholy mystified objects, out of reach and touch\nfor his young hands. As a boy he had written stories in Arabic, his mother tongue, and\nhad considered pursuing writing as a career.\nHowever, upon leaving Iraq and arriving to\nthe UK at the age of thirteen he was led into\nthe path of science because his English was\nnot developed enough and he was unable\nto take courses such as English literature at\nGCSE. Throughout the years, and as his English improved, he took up writing again. At\nfirst, it was short stories he would show to\nno one, except maybe a trusted friend. In the\nmeantime he received a PhD from UCL and\nproceeded to work at Imperial as a postdoc\nin stem cell research. He went to Harvard for\na short while on a one-year contract, but his\nstay there was cut short after 9/11 because\nhe no longer felt safe staying in the country.\nWhen asked about where he gets his inspiration from, he mentioned names such as\nArthur Miller, Kafka and British playwright\nAnthony Neilson, who according to Hassan\nwrites \u201cdark twisted funny plays, that are\nalmost like fairy tales for adults\u201d. Hassan,\nbeing a humble person, proceeded to tell\nme about how he had chosen to write a letter to Harold Pinter in the \u201890s after reading\nhis book opposing the first Iraq invasion in\n\u201891; \u201cI have to write him a letter I thought,\nit doesn\u2019t matter if he doesn\u2019t answer, so I\nwrote a letter to the publisher and would you\n\u201cHassan\u2019s characters\ndrink work, fall in love\nand have insecurities.\u201d\nProphet and Loss\nTaiba Suddek talks to Hassan Abdulrazzak, one of IC\u2019s\nown, about his new play exploring the Arab Spring\n\u201cHe continues to say\nthat scientists make\ngood playwrights\u201d\nCompetition Winners\nHaving waded through the tens of entries and\nafter several heated debates late into the night\nover who should win, the Editor selected the winner of our \u03c0-curious competition.

    "content": "Last week was unusual in politics, with a politician making a clear statement about their position on what to some is considered a controversial topic. Barack \u2018Big O\u2019 Obama clarified\nwhat he had previously described as his evolving attitudes to same-sex marriage, finally saying in an interview on US channel ABC,\n\u201cIt is important for me to go ahead and\naffirm that I think same sex couples should\nbe able to get married.\u201d\nWith this action Obama has become the first\nsitting US president to support gay marriage\nand has received a large amount of praise from\nAmerica\u2019s gay community. While Obama has\nhistorically been reticent on his opinion on\ngay marriage, some thought that the potential\npolitical fallout might have caused him to stay\nhis hand. However with his work on repealing\nthe \u201cDon\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy in 2011 he\nhas been seen by many as friendly to the notion of gay marriage, if not an open supporter.\nHowever Obama has always expressed that\nhis Christian belief has made him difficult to\ninstantly accept the concept of gay marriage,\nalthough he revealed last week that his wife\nhad a hand in his final acceptance. The President has clarified that this is his personal view,\nnot a federal position and he will not interfere\nwith how the states choose to form their leg-islation.\nUnlike the assumed impulsive leap, this\nviewpoint seems to have developed slowly,\nwith his first step being removing the HIV\ntravel ban, a move that had been initiated by\nthe outgoing George W. Bush. Then as well as\nrepealing the DADTAct, he and several senior\nofficials declared that the Defense of Marriage\nAct (which defines marriage as the union between one man and one woman) was unconstitutional and pressured the Justice Department\nto stop defending said law.\nHowever, some people believe that Obama\u2019s\ndecision to publicly show his support for\nsame-sex marriage was purely a calculated\npolitical move. Since his Vice President Joe\nBiden has announced his own support for\nsame-sex marriages earlier in the week, so a\nfew people have suggested that Obama was\nforced to come up with a public response, lest\nhe lose favour in the upcoming elections. Others have remarked that the Obama 2012 Presidential campaign is running with less energy\nthan the 2008 campaign due what may seem\nas a disappointing track record as President\ncompared to the hopes stirred by is previous\nimage as a fresh \u2013faced senator and bringer of\nchange. It is implied that by supporting gay\nmarriage the Obama campaign might attract\nmore of the youth vote which gave it the momentum that carried it to the White House,\nespecially since it is a subject, which is supported much more by the younger generations\nthan the more politically static older genera-tions.\nThe Obama campaign denies all accusations of political manoeuvring, insisting that\nOne small step for POTUS\nSeriously, there\u2019s a moth behind you! I\u2019m just lookin\u2019 out for you...\nthe President had in fact made his decision\nsome time ago and had planned to express\nhis views to the public closer to the election,\nhowever they admitted that they felt the episode with Joe Biden and the resulting media\npressure had forced their hand.\nWhile Obama\u2019s thoughts on same-sex marriage are personal, as the President of the\nUnited States his opinions do carry serious\nweight both domestically and internationally.\nIn the United States gay marriage laws are decided on a state-by-state basis, with 6 states\nalong with the District of Columbia (Wash-ington D.C.) currently have laws which allow same-sex marriage while other state laws\nrange from accepting civil unions to a com-plete. Most recently the state of North Carolina approved an amendment to their constitution (by a majority of 22% of votes) that\nbanned same-sex marriages and other unions,\nadding to their statutory ban.\nAs one politician steps forward, it seems another steps back. Disappointment struck the\nUK\u2019s gay community when in the Queen\u2019s\nSpeech in the House of Lords there was no\nmention of the expected bill on same-sex\nmarriage. It seems while David Cameron is\nin favour of legalising gay-marriage, after a\nbeating in local elections a fortnight ago and\nfirm dissention from the Tory grassroots, his\ngovernment has decided to put the issue on\nthe backburner along with the House of Lords\nreform, preferring to focus on less controversial topics.\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPolitics Editors: Joseph Letts\nRajat Jain\nPOLITICS\nFELIX Friday 18 MAY 2012 15\nObama\u2019s evolution of thought on same-sex marriage\nEuropean Troubles\npolitics.felix@ic.ac.uk\nGot something to say?

Hollande,\nleader of the Socialist Party has immediately begun to make waves in what is an already turbulent\ntime in Eurpoean politics. As well as seeking to renege on Sarkozy\u2019s agreement with the rest of Eurpoe tying France into a path of austerity, he also\nhas not let go of plans to tax high earners with a\n\u20ac1m pay packet by 75%. As well as piddling over\nChancellor Merkel and former President Sarkozy\u2019s\nmethod for recovering Europe\u2019s debt and saving\nthe Euro he has also criticized the UK for placing\ntoo much hope on our financial services industry,\nsignalling support for an EU-wide tax on financial\ntransactions and a push for tax harmonisation.\nREUTERS / Joshua Roberts\nRory Fenton\nGreek Tragedy\nAfter an attempt by\nthe temporary tech-nocratic Greek government to reduce\ngovernment spending and follow the\nterms of their bailout loans, the Greek\npeople showed their\ndispleasure by an\nuneven spread of\nvotes in the recent\nelections.

LOL, oh well.\nD\nespite being released over ten\nyears ago, Band of Brothers\nholds it own in the TV hall of\nfame. Beautifully filmed and\nexquisitely produced \u2013 as you\u2019d\nwell hope with an estimated budget of $125m \u2013\nit\u2019s an absolute tour de force.\nLabelled as a TV mini-series, it consists of\nten episodes, each about an hour and quarter in\nlength, following the journey of Easy Company\nof the US Army 101st Airborne division during\nWWII. Band of Brothers was inspired by a book\nof the same title by Stephen Ambrose, which\ndocuments the actual journey of Easy company\nthrough the war.\nThe plight of Easy Company begins with basic training in Georgia where they are trained to\nbe the best under the ferociously harsh Captain\nSobel who forces them to run up the infamous\n\u2018Currahee\u2019 mountain many-a-time. We follow Easy Company to England for their final\npreparation before they land frantically strewn\nover Normandy as part of Operation Overlord.\nFollowing this we see them losing men in a\nheavy battle whilst liberating the French town\nof Carentan.\nEasy Company are then dropped into the\nNetherlands as part of Operation Market Garden where they are tasked with liberating Eindhoven. Later the company is called to Bastogne\nto fight in the Battle of the Bulge and have to\nsurvive the treacheries of a harsh winter and\nlow supply levels. Having endured the winter\nin Bastogne Easy Company carries out a dangerous mission in Haguenau. In the penultimate\nepisode, aptly named \u2018Why We Fight\u2019, we see\nthe troops enter Germany and discover something unimaginable; the Landsberg Concentration Camp, containing over 5,000 prisoners\nsuffering from famine, disease and exhaustion.\nFinally the company captures the Eagle\u2019s Nest\nand discovers the house of Herman Goering.\nThey later move to Austria where V-E day (Vic-tory in Europe day) is announced. Some troops\nare sent home whilst others begin training to go\nto war in the Pacific.\nThere are many great films about WWII that\nare somewhat humbling including my favourites Saving Private Ryan, Schindler\u2019s List and\nThe Pianist. None of them immerse you in the\nBand of Brothers will blow you away\nsame way as Band of Brothers. They don\u2019t even\ncome close. Having a total run-time of nearly\ntwelve hours is probably partly to thank for\nthis. But, perhaps of greater importance is the\nconnection between the real veterans (who introduce each episode) and their characters. It\ngives the series meaning and a certain feeling\nof actuality. You imagine these people, nigh on\nseventy year ago in the very same situation - if\nnot worse \u2013 living the horrors of war that you\nwatch from the comfort of your living room.\nBeing devoid of any sort of subplot \u2013 no\nromances left at home, no ongoing friction\nbetween soldiers \u2013 we see a deeper side of\nwar; how it changes people, relationships,\nmental states. Soldiers form bonds greater\nthan that between brothers. They suffer from\nshell shock, losing limbs, losing friends\nand towards the end of the war; alcoholism.\n\u201cThere are many great\nfilms about WWII...none\nof them immerse you in\nthe same way as Band of\nBrothers\u201d\nWe see the progression of soldiers being scared\nof, to accepting death and its inevitable place in\nwar.

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX\nFriday 18 may 2012\n6\nThe financial outcome of the charity\nevent Fusion@London has finally become clear. As reported previously in\nFelix, there was initially a long, slow,\nand confusing period of uncertainty as\nto exactly what the situation was. Up\nuntil as recently as 1 May, there were\nstill invoices that needed to be paid.\nHowever, the loss is now known and\neActivities (the online record of transactions for clubs and societies) currently gives an accurate representation\nof the financial failure of the event. In\ntotal, the event lost \u00a315,506.91.\nFusion@London, founded by Angela\nUdemba, who is a PhD student at Imperial, is not the first event under the\nFusion name. The concept and first\nshow was in York in 2005 and Angela\nUdemba became the creative director\nin 2008, when the show was still at\nYork. The York events were successful and so she brought the idea to London. This year marked the first London\nbased Fusion event, which were held at\nThe Troxy in Limehouse on Saturday\n25 and Sunday 26 February. The website for the event states that: \u201cAt the\nheart of Fusion@London is an extravagant annual fashion music and dance\nfundraising event\u201d. The aim was to\nraise money for the charity Cancer Research UK. The fundraising target was\nstated on the website as being \u00a350,000.\nA large amount of sponsorship from\nvarious different companies was ac-quired. The total amount from the\nplethora of sources was \u00a38,400. The\nmain sponsors were Ernst & Young,\nwith the Gold sponsors being Deutsche\nvery well. The Halloween\nthemed Masquerade Ball,\nwhich was held at Caf\u00e9 de\nParis and featured 2-4-1 cock-tails, raffles, and prizes for best\ndressed, made nearly \u00a35000. This\nwas used as the launch party, and\nsignified the only point when Fusion\nwas in the black.\nAs the opening night for the event\ndrew closer some problems were in-curred.The Made in Chelsea stars could\nnot all make both nights. On Saturday,\nall three dropped out due to filming\nBank, and smaller companies, retailers,\nand clubs being the Silver and Bronze\nsponsors.\nThe nature of the event itself has\nbeen described as a creative amalgamation of fashion, music, and dance. It\nis a show entirely organised and performed by students primarily from IC\nand involves a cast of at least 100 and a\ncommittee of 16-18. It had several musical headline acts and was supposed\nto be presented by three of the stars of\nMade in Chelsea \u2013 Spencer Matthews,\nHugo Taylor and Binky Felstead.\nMuch like the loss-making Summer\nBall of 2011, Fusion was jointly held\nby institutions, in this case Imperial\nCollege London Union (the Union),\nUniversity College London Union\n(UCLU), and King\u2019s College London\nUnion (KCLSU). As stated in the original article, neither UCLU nor KCLSU\nwere financially responsible in any way\nfor the event. This meant that the only\nstudent union actually risking money\nwas Imperial College London\u2019s Union,\ni.e. the Union. When asked why UCLU\ndidn\u2019t put any money in for the event,\nthe reply was that \u201c[UCLU] don\u2019t\nbelieve they [Fusion] asked\u201d. Some\nsocieties from the other Universities\nwere involved, although they carried\nnone of the financial burden. UCLU\nsaid that some of their students were\ninvolved and that \u201cFusion were especially keen for the involvement of [the]\nDance Society\u201d. However, they had\nother commitments and were therefore\nunable to commit much to the show,\nand the Dance Society didn\u2019t want to\nparticipate in Fusion as an official society activity.\nInitially, everything was progressing\nTim Arbabzadah\nRavi Pall\ncom-mitments.\nIt was stated\nin their contracts that\nFusion could not have them,\nor accept an alternative, if they had\nfilming commitments. Therefore they\nwere not paid and a replacement, the\nmusician Sarvi, had to be arranged\nthrough Max Clifford. On Sunday\nnight Hugo and Spencer turned up and\nwere subsequently paid.\nFallout as event\nloses over\n\u00a315,000\nHalloween\nrade Ball,\nat Caf\u00e9 de\nd 2-4-1 cock-prizes for best\narly \u00a35000.

    "content": "BOOKS\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBooks Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nFELIX Friday 18 MAY 2012 27\nMonster Hunter International \u2013 looks like a friendly bunch\nWerewolves, vampires and lots of guns\nI\nt\u2019s not everyday that you get to\nthrow your boss out of a 14th-story window, but that\u2019s exactly\nhow this story kicks off, and\nfrom the start till finish, it\u2019s one\nheck of a thrilling roller coaster ride.\nNo, it\u2019s not a story about an insane,\nstressed accountant finally breaking\ndown and deciding to test out Newton\u2019s\nlaw of gravitation on his boss. In fact,\ngiven all the crazy stuff that goes down\nin the book, the protagonist, Owen Zastava Pitt is actually quite a sane guy.\nYou see, the boss in question had\nvery recently morphed into a werewolf\nand was actively trying to rip Owen\u2019s\nguts out, so it wasn\u2019t exactly an overreaction to decide that he really needed\nsome fresh city air. I know. Werewolves\nsound awfully familiar. In fact, they\nwere featured quite prominently in a\nseries that I have never read, and probably won\u2019t be reading anytime soon \u2013\nTwilight. Heck, there are even vampires\nin Monster Hunter International, loads\nof them, but that\u2019s where the similarities end.\nThere\u2019s nothing remotely sexy about\nvampires found in the world of Monster\nHunter International. Their skin doesn\u2019t\nglow and shine, and they certainly don\u2019t\ntry to seduce teenage girls. What they\ndo try to do however is rip your heads\noff, all the while taking a lot of hurt in\nthe form of bullets, flamethrowers, and\neven grenades without even batting an\neyelid. Which brings me to my next\npoint. There is a lot of gun talk in the\nbook, and I mean a lot. Larry Correia\nclearly knows his guns, and it shows.\nWhile it\u2019s true that I\u2019ve seen people\ncomplain about how he goes overboard\nwith his gun descriptions, I can honestly\nsay that, even though I\u2019m not a gun per-son, I thoroughly enjoyed the book.And\nif any of you actually like guns, then all\nthe better!\nWith this book, Larry Correia has\ncreated a dark urban fantasy world that\ndoesn\u2019t cease to amaze. Combining\nLovecraft\u2019s Cthulhu Mythos with zom-bies, werewolves, vampires, a secret\ngovernment bureau, a monster hunting\ncompany, a tough as nails protagonist\nand lots of firepower, the author paints\nsuch an action packed scenario that\nreading the book is literally like watching a blockbuster movie, except it\u2019s all\npacked into the 700 odd pages of this\nimmensely entertaining novel.\nFinally, I would like to point out\nthat this book is not a thought provok-ing, deep piece of literature. And it\ndoesn\u2019t pretend to be one. This is one\nof those books that you actually read\njust for entertainment, and that feeling\nof \u2018wow, that was awesome\u2019, followed\nby a strong urge to buy the sequel. So\nif you\u2019re even mildly interested in urban fantasy settings, monsters, guns, or\nmaybe all of the above, this is the book\nfor you. Heck, I\u2019ll even recommend this\nbook to anyone who just wants a good\nfun read filled with jaw dropping action!\nA heartwrenching and powerful read\nI don\u2019t usually read a lot of contemporary literary fiction but I\u2019m always\nlooking to broaden my horizons and so\nI happily picked up Emma Donoghue\u2019s\nRoom when it was selected by the Imperial Book Club as our latest read.\nThe novel is narrated in first person\nby Jack, a five-year-old born after his\nmother was abducted and abused by a\nman who he calls Old Nick. The two\nare kept confined in the titular room,\nactually a converted shed in the man\u2019s\ngarden, with Jack\u2019s mother letting\nthe boy believe that this is the entire\nextent of the world in order to help\nhim deal with the difficult situation.\nWhile certainly very absorbing and\nnot short of moments of tension, this\nis, for the main part, a subtle and introspective look at how being trapped\nand isolated from society for over half\na decade can affect a person. The subject matter is dealt with both realistically and sensitively. You really get a\nreal feel for the emotions of the protagonists and only the most heartless of\nreaders could not strongly empathise\nwith them by the end of the novel.\nWhat really positively surprised\nme about the Room is that it continues for almost two hundred pages after what in many other books would\nbe considered the climax. Donoghue\nshows herself to be a truly superior\nwriter by going on to consider the\nconsequences of her resolution to the\nproblems set up in the first part of the\nnovel while at the same time providing a whole different viewpoint on\nthe established characters. There is a\nclear divide between the two halves\nof the book, but Donoghue\u2019s skill\nshows through in that they flow together \u2013 with the second part feeling\nIvan Ho reviews Monster Hunter International \u2013 the ultimate antidote to Twilight\n\u201cWhilst cool and\nedgy, it has also\ngrown rusty in the\nlast twenty years.\u201d\nlike a natural progression of the first.\nThe major criticism of those who\ndid not like this book has been Jack\u2019s\nnarration, with some calling it distracting and annoying while others\nsaying that the vocabulary and sentence structure is not really believable for a five year old. I can only\nsay that I found the book perfectly\nreadable and convincing. Sure, the\nEmma Donoghue\u2019s Room \u2013 an exploration of the psychology of isolation and abduction\nMaciej Matuszewski\n\u201cA subtle look at how\nbeing trapped and\nisolated from society\ncan affect a person.\u201d\ngrammar is somewhat nonstandard,\nadding to the feel that this is really\nthe internal monologue of a small\nchild, but I got used to very quickly.\nIn fact, for me, the narration is one\nof the main selling points of the book.\nIt provides a viewpoint that interesting and rarely seen in fiction. Jack\nis free of many of the preconceptions and prejudices held by adults\nand so looks at the world in a more\ninnocent and much clearer way.\nRoom is an intelligent and powerful book. It is no surprise that it has\nwon numerous awards and received\nwidespread praise. If you are looking for a serious read be sure to pick\nup this book \u2013 you\u2019re sure to find\nit a deeply rewarding experience.\n\u201clike watching a\nblockbuster movie\u201d\n\u201cYou get a real feel\nfor the emotions of\nthe protagonists.\u201d\n\n"

I felt that the eulogy\nof such an important figure wasn\u2019t a\nwriting to be rushed. Adam Yauch,\nbetter known as MCA, passed away\non the 4th May, aged 47. His death immediately\nsent ripples through the world; statuses and\ntweets lamenting the loss of such a talent, along\nwith simple R.I.P.s, abounded as soon as the\nnews hit. If you want to read a eulogy that mine\ncould never live up to, check http://beastieboys.\ncom/. A New York native, MCA\u2019s music career\nreally started when he founded a hardcore punk\ngroup known as Beastie Boys.\nIt\u2019s not hard to see the influence that their\nyears as a hardcore group had on the Beastie\nBoys sound. Their debut album, Licensed To\nIll (1986), was perhaps the first example of\n\u201crap-rock\u201d in history. Breaking through as the\nfirst white rap group of any note, Licensed To\nIll went platinum \u2013 the first ever rap album to\ndo so - and then some, although it was attacked\nby some critics and die-hard hip-hop fans as being culture pirating; the Beastie Boys viewed\nas Frat-boy and macho. This album, and many\n(if not all) of their later releases would become\nstaples in every suburban white kid\u2019s musical\nlife story.\nConstantly penetrating into my and, I assume,\nyour lives, Beastie Boys produced some of the\nmost ubiquitous riffs, samples and rhymes in\nhistory, including the hilarious \u2018Fight For Your\nRight\u2019: a parody on the moronic hard rock being\nchurned out at the time, meatheads still turned\nup their gigs and went mental, not realising they\nwere being lampooned. Perhaps even more fa-mous, what party is complete without surfaces\nand bottles being smashed in a ruckus incited by\n\u2018No Sleep Till Brooklyn\u2019? Or, in the case of my\nsocial circle, five of us drunkenly shouting the\nlyrics and kicking things while everyone else at\nthe wine tasting looked on in disgust. Perhaps\nit\u2019s solely due to the release date but I found\nTo The 5 Boroughs (2004) to be particularly\nprominent throughout my early teenage years,\nespecially the nerdy rhymes laid down within\n\u2018Ch-Check it Out\u2019. The explosive opening\nrhymes of \u2018Intergalactic\u2019 (Hello Nasty, 1998)\nare also permanently burned into my memory\nfrom Beastie Boys\u2019 brief appearance (actually\nnot featuring Yauch, sadly) on Futurama.\nMany of their most successful singles were\naccompanied by phenomenal videos. Above\nmentioned \u2018Intergalactic\u2019 features a giant robot\ndestroying a city by popping while the boys\nrap, and was directed, along with other greats\nsuch as \u2018Body Movin\u2019\u2019, \u2018So Watcha Want\u2019, and\n\u2018Ch-Check it Out\u2019 by MCA under his pseudonym Nathanial H\u00f6rnblow\u00e9r. MCA was\nheavily involved in film, running a New York\nR.I.P. Adam Yauch\nCity independent distribution company, Oscilloscope Laboratories. As if this still wasn\u2019t\nenough contribution to the world, he was also\nan active Buddhist, and campaigned heavily to\nfree Tibet. Instead of focusing on the negatives\nof losing a great artist, rapper, and all-round per-son, I propose that we all take an hour out of\nrevision season to stick on our favourite (if you\ndon\u2019t have one, now seems like an ideal time to\nget one) Beastie Boys album and pay homage to\nthe one and only MCA.\nRoss Grayremembers the legendary MCA ofBeastie Boy fame\nDon Caballero have adopted a wide range of\nsounds (and line-ups) over the years, but arguably\nit was their early albums that were the most infuen-tial. They are one of many math bands, and most\ncertainly the best, to have come from Pittsburgh.\nThe band first formed in 1991 with Damon Che\non drums, Mike Banfield on guitar and Pat Morris\non bass. Ian Williams joined the band a year later.\nA highly revered drummer, affectionately known\nas \u2018the octopus\u2019, Che was a large reason for the\nband\u2019s success. It was his use of unusual time\nsignatures, switching between them at a split second\u2019s notice that allowed them to adopt the math\nrock sound and produce some of its best work. It\nis only fitting perhaps that Che is the only constant\nmember. They released their debut album, For\nRespect, the next year. The band, who had initially\nplanned to hire a singer, remained instrumental\ndue to their success without one. The album was\ncharacterised by a beefy crunch of guitars and big\nriffs with occasional more relaxing moments. For\nany other band, this would be their opus, but with\nsubsequent releases, Don Caballero 2 and What\nBurns Never Returns, they expanded their sound,\nadding more melodic touches, but maintaining the\nexperimental time signatures and even making\nthem more technically challenging.\nDespite their immense talent as a creative unit,\ntheir work was made with a seemingly revolving\ndoor of bassists and eventually, in 1998, Mike Banfield left the band. Instead of replacing him, Don\nCab took the bold move of remaining as a trio and\nusing Akai headrush loop stations to compensate\nfor Banfield\u2019s absence. Thus, American Don was\nmade, an album that continues their previous di-rection, with some very catchy riffs and meandering\nsoundscapes. This album reminds me a lot of the\nwork Williams would go on to do with Battles. However, as with every other Don Cab line up, it came\nto an end, when Williams and Che fell out.\nThe band was finished until 2003, when Che assembled an all new line up. Normally a recipe for\ndisaster, this actually led to an album of just as\nmuch quality as their previous efforts, World Class\nListening Problem. Che\u2019s impressive fills remained,\nalong with a very talented band playing around\nthem, formed from fellow Pitsburghers, Creta Bourzia. Finally, they released another album in 2008,\nPunkgasm, everybody\u2019s least favourite Don Cab al-bum, featuring unpopular attempts at vocals. However, mini epic, \u2018Loudest Shop Vac in the World\u2019 is\nworth admission alone.\nIn short, if you like your music intelligent, catchy\nand technically proficient or are just curious to hear\nthe band that spawned Ian Williams, you can get a\nserious kick out of Don Caballero.\nRiaz Agahi\nPt. III - Don Caballero\nHowler rip upThe Garage\nWith the NME/Q provided hype train fully\nderailed circa February, exactly how much\n\u2018howl\u2019 do the Minneapolitans still have? To\nmy surprise on a tepid Tuesday night in Highbury, \u2018the pseudo-strokes\u2019 still have some fire\nleft in their collective belly.\nSupport was offered by four piece Canadian\nindie rock outfit Hooded Fang who were by\nall accounts, rather good. Dynamic from the\nstart and easily catching the slowly building\ncrowd\u2019s attention (and keeping it) as they\nblitzed through some powerful up tempo pop-py-rock numbers. An act to look out for down\nthe bill in the festival circuit over the summer.\nAs Howler come on to the stage (uncharac-teristically on time) it is not hard to see why so\nmany comparisons have been drawn with the\nNYC post-punk indie godfathers I alluded to\nat the beginning of the article. From the wayfarers lazily drooped over lead singer Jordan\nGatesmith\u2019s doe eyes to the seemingly multiplying bottles of San Miguel lazily drooped\nover the stage, the aesthetic parallels with Julian and co. are patent. At the risk of annoying\nHowler, you and myself anymore, I will no\nlonger refer to The Strokes in the article.\nDespite the ominous signs of inebriation,\nthey open the set with a spotless rendition\nof \u2018Wailing (Making Out)\u2019 which immediately works the crowd into fervour. Beads\nof sweat are easily visible amongst the audience by the time the count in for the second\ntrack \u2018America\u2019 has begun. The tracks from\ntheir debut, America Give Up, which has been\non the shelves for five months now, lack the\nfreshness that endeared them to critics and\nrecord label executives alike last summer but\ndue to the catchy nature of the drawn out guitar melody\u2019s and relentless enthusiasm shown\nby the band itself (despite the lead guitarist\nadmittedly recovering from a nasty bout of\nshingles) the entire room is very much en-gaged. Particular highlights of the set are the\ncrescendo building \u2018Beach Sluts\u2019, alt-rock\nballad \u2018Too Much Blood\u2019 and Mustang-riding\n\u2018Pythagorean Fearem\u2019. Jordan keeps a good\nrapport with the crowd, even at liberty to discuss where he acquired his burgundy chinos\nto the more inquisitive members of the audi-ence.\nThe set flies by and I found myself checking\nthe watch in disbelief as they announced set\ncloser and single \u2018Back Of Your Neck\u2019, but\nthanks to some timely stage invading and a\nlittle help from Hooded Fang guitarist, they\nmanage to muster up an eventful encore with\na new unnamed track. By the time they have\nexhausted every last bit of material and onstage booze they have, the band look almost\nas disappointed as the crowd as they vacate\nthe stage.\nAlthough the potential of Howler is hardly\nbursting at the seams anymore they still have\na lot to offer in terms of a good old fashioned\nrock n\u2019 roll live experience. With eyes firmly\nfixed ahead and talk of a new album already\nrippling amongst the remaining faithful, the\nboys from Minnesota aren\u2019t done yet.\nSimon Clark\nAdam Yauch (8.5.1964 \u2013 5.4.2012)\nCheck out Howler at some festivals this year including Benicassim and Latitude\n\n"

The results for two of\nthe Sabbatical positions were delivered late \u2013 one because of disputes\nbetween candidates, one because of\na technical fault and the subsequent\nactions to \u2018resolve\u2019 it. There is yet to\nbe any formal communication from\nthe Union over the former or latter\n\u2013 the nature of the complaints and\ndisputes, or what exactly had gone\nwrong. When the brand sparkling new\nwebsite, stick figures, and #voteicu\nare set aside, there\u2019s one blunt truth:\nthe system wasn\u2019t checked before it\nwent up, and nobody was on-hand to\nfix problems when they arose. The\nvoting website did indeed work, you\ncould put numbers in boxes, see people\u2019s names and photos, and, for the\nmost part, manifestos (the 250-word\n\u2018vote for me\u2019 segment people write)\nwould be \u2018in-line\u2019 with their names.\nBut, unfortunately, in some cases you\ncouldn\u2019t see their manifestos, and it\ninstead said \u2018no manifesto submitted\u2019,\nwhich in some cases was incorrect,\nor mixed them up for people running\nfor multiple positions. Not submitting a manifesto can be interpreted\nas not caring enough to write one, or\nstanding as a joke, and candidates are\ngiven ample warning about by when it\nshould be written. But, this wasn\u2019t for\nall the candidates; as has been done\nin the last years, when you had to go\nthrough the extra effort of clicking on\ntheir name to see them. One of those\naffected was running for a Sabbatical\nRole, and over 500 people had voted\nfor the DPW position (nearly 1000 in\ntotal had voted for a variety of posi-tions) before that problem was fixed,\n11.6% of those cast in that election.\nThat the Returning Officer was only\nmade aware of the issue in the election he was supposedly running when\ntold about it by that candidate as he\nwas walking into the office that morning (the candidate was making preparations for the charity bike auction to\nbe held that afternoon in Beit Quad),\nis far from ideal. That no impartial\nmember of college staff was overseeing the election, as is demanded in\nthe Constitution (the text by which\nthe Union is run and managed), was\nalso strange, and something that will,\nhopefully, be avoided in future.\nIt was agreed that this wasn\u2019t fair\non that person, it\u2019s their employment\nnext year that\u2019s at stake and this is an\nissue that does actually matter to some\npeople, and it was decided that anyone who voted before when his manifesto went \u2018live\u2019 have their vote struck\noff (it was claimed that they wouldn\u2019t\nbe able to vote again). This was pointed out to be (a) unfair on the people\nwhose votes were discounted (and\nthereby ignored, and democracy isn\u2019t\nabout that), and (b) unconstitutional,\nby a number of people. He agreed to\nit because he hadn\u2019t been told about\nany of the other options that had been\nconsidered, as did all the other can-didates.\nFrom here, the judicial body governing the Union (whose job is to\nuphold the Constitution of the body,\nwhich one of the Sabbatical Officers\nhad gone against through that action)\nsaid that (a) you can\u2019t go against the\nConstitution like that, and (b) that the\ncandidate was disadvantaged at no\nfault of his own. It was decided that\na rerun of the election, which two of\nthe four candidates had asked for (one\nwas opposed due to having put too\nmuch work in to do it again, the other\nwasn\u2019t present and had given no reason for his absence) wasn\u2019t possible,\nand that nothing would be done about\nthis farce aside from measures (which\npossibly should have already been in\nplace) being prepared so it can\u2019t happen again.\nThe next day the results were released (so these decisions were come\nto before any results came out and\nwere thus come to independent of any\nresult). In the first round of voting, the\nThe great election farce\naffected candidate was only 7 votes\nbehind the eventual winner (out of\nover 4000 cast, or under 0.2%). That\ncandidate ended up losing to the DPW\nelect by 61 votes (so if only 31 out of\n4500-odd, or under 0.7% of votes cast\nhad gone to the affected candidate, he\nwould have been the winner), leaving\nit at a victory by a margin of 6% of the\ndisputed votes.\nWhen he requested an apology over\nthe incident from the Returning Officer over (a) his manifesto not being\non the website initially (this despite\nhim jumping through all the hoops\nrequired), and (b) an admittance that\nit was unfair, he was refused on both\ncounts.\nThat candidate, who lost an election\nthat was deemed unfair on him, is me.\nWhy have I written this? To get the\ntruth about it across, given that it\u2019s\nnot going to be done otherwise, and to\ngive it from the perspective of someone on the receiving end of these unfortunate occurrences. It\u2019s not to spite\nor antagonise anyone, more just to say\nmy piece about it all and move on.\nJack Hewitt\nLast week Felix commented that it could be\nworthwhile to focus on improving the \u2018student experience\u2019 from within rather than\nfrom focusing on comparison with other\nuniversities. If anything, it has emerged\nthat focusing internally would indeed be\nbeneficial regarding the current Wilson\nHouse hall senior situation.\nWith seniors originally under the impression that they would be guaranteed accommodation somewhere as Wilson undergoes\nrefurbishment next year, those that have\nbeen recruited for the position have been\ntold that this could be untenable, with the\nplans of many of these individuals thrown\ninto turmoil, and rooms potentially being\nsought externally to reach the guaranteed\namount of accommodation for next year\u2019s\nintake.\nAt the heart of the issue, it falls to College and what has been described as \u201ca\nsevere lack of communication\u201d on their\npart with the Wardens of Imperial in order\nto keep those most at risk of losing out in\nthe loop with ongoing developments. After\nall, miscommunication on this level cannot\nbe, in any way, shape, or form, be beneficial for the \u2018student experience\u2019.\nWardens and those holding senior positions in halls of accommodation should\nbe the first to be made aware of events\nsuch as refurbishments rather than being\nthe first to hear of \u201chints\u201d. After all, people\nhave chosen to live in this fashion, providing help to those who need it, and being\nkept in the dark with respect to this is simply not beneficial for any kind of mutual\nrelationship.\nStudents are the first to suffer from the\nlack of knowledge that their seniors and\nwardens can provide. The wardening system at Imperial is an important facet of\nthe community, especially for Freshers\nand their adjustment to a new way of life\nand independence. Anything that could potentially damage the relationship between\nthe wardening team and students goes\nto ultimately damage the \u2018student experience\u2019. It is important that during the next\nstages of any potential hall closure and the\nWilson House refurbishment that there is\nclear communication between the relevant\nparties, and that there is full and clear .\nOtherwise, dissatisfaction will be an easily\napparent prospect.\nThe closure of various halls of accommodation that has been regularly touted as an\noption throughout the year begs the question as to why Imperial should be in this position in the first place. The circumstances\nthat led to a shortfall in the required rooms\nfor next year\u2019s intake must be heavily\nconsidered.\nAccommodation and\nCommunication\nPolling booth, or toilet stalls with low privacy - Caption, or satire... This shit just got meta\nThat the Returning\nOfficer was only\nmade aware of\nthe issue in the\nelection he was\nsupposedly running\nwhen told about it\nby that candidate...\nis far from ideal\n\u201c\nThat th\nThat th\nOfficer\nOfficer\n\u201d\ndidate...\ndidate...\ndeal\ndea\n\n"

Arriving at the\nsunny Wiltshire in the morning, avoiding the wealth of carbon time trial bikes\nin the car park, the task of 750m of\nswimming, 25km of cycling and 5km\nof running lay ahead.\nSwimming in a heady mix of chlorine and sweat from the 300 previous\ncompetitors is unenviable stuff but\nAndrew Gordon, in particular, made\nit look very comfortable, covering the\ndistance in an impressive 11:31. Three\nother team members (the Captain Stephen Cooper, new-comer Luke Johnston and Will Palmer) were coincidentally placed in the same lane, allowing\nfor the convivial competition over the\nnext 85 minutes or so. The next disciple\nsaw Andrew again set the quickest time\namongst the Imperial team, averaging\n33km per hour over a windy and hilly\ncourse.\nThe final element, a 5km undulated\nrun saw three of the team run under 19\nminutes placing them in the top 50 for\nthat disciples: Rueben Bogg (18:12),\nAndrew Gordon (18:54), Sam O\u2019Neill\n(18:55). And it was these three who led\nhome the TriIC team overall.\nAt the top of the leaderboard, some\nhigh-jinx (in the form of cycling in a\ngroup which is not permitted) from six\nof the top ten competitors meant that the\nBUCS champion was only determined\nonce those involved in the shenanigans\nwere handed time penalties. Naughty\nboys ! For the team event, with 60 university teams qualifying, Imperial \u2018A\u2019\nfinished 25th and the \u2018B\u2019 team 52nd.\nTriIC have a number of informal and\nformal training sessions for all beginners to experts. Any men and women\nout there who would like to join in then\nplease see www.union.ic.ac.uk/acc/\ntriathlon/.\nThe annual three day BUCS regatta\nat Nottingham\u2019s Holme Pierrepont is\nusually a test of endurance, both physical and mental, and this year was no\nexception. With competitors entered\nin multiple events on a single day and\nwith weather ranging from pouring\nrain to brilliant sunshine, ICBC was\nput through its paces from start to fin-ish. By the end of the weekend, 126\nBUCS points had been accumulated as\nwell as an array of medals, many coming from the lightweight men.\nSaturday seemed quiet due to the\nabsence of all novice competitors. The\norganising committee had decided that,\nafter the multiple sinkings of last year\nand the horrendous weather forecast,\nthey would chancel beginners\u2019 racing.\nIn the end, the conditions were rowable\nwith a solid tail wind leading to rapid\ntimes. Never fear, though, there was\nplenty of racing to be had, especially\nfor the women\u2019s squad. The championship quad (str: Louise Connell/Klara\nWeaver/Harriet Cross/Hannah Patterson) brought home the first piece of\nsilverware, taking second place in a\nstraight final behind Reading (7:02.3).\nAnother medal followed quickly from\nthe Intermediate pair (str: Cat Buizza/\nHarriet Cross). After a convincing win\nin their heat, the girls continued to\ndominate the field as they won the first\ngold of the weekend after a storming\nsecond half of the final (8:02.8) \u2013 a feat\nreplicated by many Imperial women\u2019s\ncrews over the weekend.\nFor the testosterone-filled side of the\nclub, the Championship Lwt four (str:\nWilf Kimberley/Tim Richards/Tom\nPearson/Gareth Brown) proved their\nmight as they won their heat by more\nthan 10s and progressed into the final,\nwhere they met rivals University of\nLondon. The boys in purple gave Imperial a run for their money and clung on\n\u2013 ICBC took the gold medal by a mere\n0.48s (6:28.3). As the lightweights\ncame into the landing stage, Kimberley and Richards continued the BUCS\ntradition of jumping out of one boat\ninto another. The Championship eight\n(cox: Libby Richards/Johnny Rankin/T\nRichards/Ben Spencer Jones/Ali Hudson/Matt Pointing/Henry Goodier/\nKimberley/Rory Sullivan) were waiting ready to head onto the waves for\nthe last final of the day. After a tight\nrace with UL in the heat, the guys were\nhunting for blood. Unfortunately, the\nmight of Newcastle, Durham and UL\njust squeezed the guys out of the med-als, despite a storming row (5:52.2).\nThankfully the weather had decided\nto turn to bright sunshine with a slight\ntail wind by Sunday. The lightweight\nmen were with the eight (cox: Jess\nJohnson/Kimberley/T Richards/Tom\nPearson/Brown/Myles Holbrough/\nPaul Jones/Elliot Jennings/Martin Ebner) easily winning their heat. There\nwas stiff competition come the final,\nas three well drilled lightweight crews\nfrom UL, Cambridge and Nottingham\nfought it out for the medals. Imperial\u2019s scratch crew, containing two\nnovices, performed admirably taking\nfourth place (6:16.8). The lightweight\nquad (str: Kimberley/T Richards/Holbrough/Jones) demolished the competition winning their heat by nearly 10s\nand the final by another 6s (6:30.2).\nThe heavier side of Imperial were in\nslightly smaller boats as the Championship coxed four (str: Rankin/Sullivan/\nSpencer Jones/Goodier/cox: Johnson)\ntook centre stage. Frustration reigned\nover the crew as they were squeezed\nout of the direct final place by the University of East London. After the heat,\nSpencer Jones could be found hovering around the bushes as a week of exams and illness mixed with two days\nof intense racing had pushed him beyond the limit. The difficult decision to\nscratch the boat before the impending\nrepechage was met with disappoint-ment, frustration and understanding in\nequal measure.\nFor the fairer half of the squad, it was\ntime for the Championship eight (cox:\nL Richards/Weaver/Connell/Lily Beadle/Patterson/Cat Buizza/Cross/Si\u00e2n\nMorgan/Maddy Whybrow), the first\ntime ICBC has had a senior women\u2019s\neight at the regatta since 2009. They\ndid not have the easiest of routes to the\nfinal. In the repechage, they learnt their\nmost useful skill \u2013 rowing through\ncrews. Having left the blocks slowest,\nthe eight crept through the field, breaking Bristol and Glasgow, one at a time\nand just inching ahead of Edinburgh in\nthe crucial final 150m. A similar story\nunfolded in the final as they gradually\nrowed through Exeter and had Durham\nin their sights but the finish line came\ntoo soon and Imperial took fifth place\n(7:01.0).\nBy Bank Holiday Monday when\nmost people are nursing a hangover,\nImperial were beginning to feel the\nstrain. The weather had turned, the sun\ndisappeared, and fog, wind and pelting\nrain arrived in the miserable Midlands.\nRacing was postponed and, in another\nBUCS tradition, racing format was re-jigged to 1500m time trials with the\nfastest six crews going through to six\nlane finals. The wind caused only the\noccasional problem in the time trials\npushing crews out of their lanes. The\nremaining men of ICBC were few and\nfar between as many had returned to\nLondon, generally to prepare for those\nlittle annoyances called exams. The\nnumbers dwindled even more once\nSullivan was hit by the same bout of\nsickness that had struck Spencer Jones\nthe day before and so the lightweights\nwere left to hold the honour of the\nclub. The gangsta lightweight double (T Richards/Kimberley) and pair\n(Kimberley/T Richards) won both time\ntrials and got lucky lane one for the fi-nals. The pair went without a hitch as\nthey led from start to finish, adding another bit of gold bling to their ever glittering collection (7:14.1). The double\nwas running the same course until the\nfinal moments when Loughborough\ndecided to shoot them down, beating\nthe guys to the gold by just 0.8s. Consolation can be taken from the fact that\nKimberley and Richards took home\nmore gold medals each than several\nuniversities.\nContinuing miserable conditions hit\nthe women\u2019s doubles (Championship \u2013\nWeaver/Patterson, Intermediate \u2013 Connell/Cross) during their time trials as\nthe heavens opened with a spectacular\ndeluge, just as they were racing. Both\nmade it to their finals to take fourth\nplace and bring another silver medal\nhome to ICBC, respectively. The two\ndoubles then combined to make the\nChampionship coxed four (str: Weaver/Connell/Cross/Patterson/cox: L\nRichards). They qualified third for the\nfinal and, although the final standing\nstart probably wasn\u2019t in their best in-terest, they showed the same resolve as\nthe women\u2019s 8 the previous day. They\nsteadily walked through crews from\nthe back of the field. In the final 400m,\nthey overtook Cambridge to earn the\nbronze (7:42.4).\nDespite injuries, sickness, a dwindled squad size thanks to exams and\nfield trips, multiple entries per athlete,\nand the dismal conditions, Imperial\nsoldiered on to take four gold, three silver and one bronze over the weekend.\nICBC was fourth in the Victor Ludorum, fifth in the medal table, and have\nracked up a total of 250 BUCS points\nin the 2011-12 season. Now all eyes\nmove to the rest of regatta season and\nthe relative comfort of Dorney Lake,\nand the pinnacle of the summer, Henley, in less than 50 days\u2019 time.\nTriathlon\nStephen Cooper\nTri-ing for Imperial at BUCS championship\nBank Holiday Boat BUCS\nBoat Club\nElizabeth Richards\n\u201cOur fortunate escape sparked a remarkable comeback\u201d\nTim Richards and Wilf Kimberley bask in the glory of BUCS\nIC Boat Club\nICTri\n\n"

    "content": "TELEVISION\nFELIX Friday 18 MAY 2012 25\nC\nreated by Craig Thomas and\nCarter Bays, this hit US sitcom\nhas been on the air since 2005 so\nit might seem a bit strange to be\nreviewing it so far into the story.\nTruth be told, I\u2019m a bit of a late-comer to How I\nMet Your Mother \u2013 I only started watching it in\nJanuary, when exam revision should have come\nfirst \u2013 oops. I have managed to catch up with the\nrest of the world and happily sat down to watch\nthe season seven finale yesterday \u2013 but more on\nthat later.\nTo those unfamiliar with this show, it centres\non the character of Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor),\nan architect living in New York. At the start of\nthe show, he is living with his room-mate from\ncollege Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel) and\nMarshall\u2019s girlfriend of nine years, Lily Aldrin\n(Alyson Hannigan). Together with Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), Ted\u2019s \u201cbest friend\u201d,\nthey can frequently be found in the local bar\nMacLaren\u2019s where Barney comes up with outrageous ways to pick up women. The pilot episode also introduces a new love interest for Ted\nin the form of aspiring Canadian reporter Robin\nScherbatsky (Cobie Smulders).\nEach episode is actually a flashback, as future\nTed tells his teenage son and daughter the story\nof how he met their mother.\nOn the surface this may sound like a Friends\nrip-off and in some ways perhaps it is: Ted is\na hopeless romantic in search of The One and\nRobin is the Rachel to his Ross, only smarter.\nLily and Marshall resemble the Chandler and\nMonica from later seasons, while Barney is\nsimilar to womanizing Joey. The only character\nmissing is Phoebe. MacLaren\u2019s is quite clearly\na replacement for Central Perk. The show even\ndebuted very shortly after Friends finished\nits run. The success of Friends clearly proved\nthat friends living together and supporting each\nother through the ups and downs of adulthood is\na popular formula and it managed to work out\nquite well for HIMYM, which is still one of the\nmost popular TV shows even after seven years.\nPersonally, I think it\u2019s better than Friends.\nAs is the case with many shows, the first\ncouple of episodes don\u2019t do the series justice.\nI tried watching it when it first came out, but\ndidn\u2019t find any of the characters particularly\nengaging or interesting, so gave up. Recommendations from numerous friends made me change\nmy mind and give it a second chance and I\u2019m\nglad I did. I guess the writers and cast simply\nneeded some time to find a rhythm that works\nfor everyone and the writing has been solid\never since. The writers have given us some\ntruly memorable moments and catch-phras-es, whilst also making sure that the characters\ndevelop over the years as they pass from their\nlate twenties to early thirties.\nThe thing that actually got me hooked on HIMYM is an element that I haven\u2019t often found\nin this genre, namely cliffhangers. It\u2019s true that\nthey are nowhere near as gripping as those from,\nfor example Lost, but they have kept me on the\nedge of my seat nonetheless throughout the 159\nepisodes that have aired so far. The biggest cliffhanger and mystery is, of course, the identity of\nthe mother. It\u2019s been seven years and we still\ndon\u2019t know who she is and based on the last episode of the season, we won\u2019t be finding out for a\nwhile. Teasing the audience like this is common,\nFrasier managed to talk about but never show\nthe character of Maris for eleven years while we\nare also yet to meet Howard\u2019s mom on Big Bang\nTheory. It keeps viewers coming back, although\nI wonder how much longer they can keep it up.\nIt\u2019s impossible to review any show without\ncommenting on the actors that bring the characters to life. Although he\u2019s not the main char-acter, the star that really shines is Neil Patrick\nHarris as Barney. His escapades are out of this\nworld but he manages to deliver every line with\na straight face and provides us with most of the\nlaugh-out-loud moments. That being said, the\nLucia Podhorska recalls just How I Met Your Mother\nrest of the cast is also great. Jason Segel\nis charming as an aspiring environmental\nlawyer that believes in the supernatural\nand together with Alyson Hannigan they\nare the most solid on-screen couple I have\nseen in a while. Fans of the American Pie\nmovies will get to see the actress behind\nband geek Michelle show off her comedy\nskills. Cobie Smulders I wasn\u2019t too sure\nabout for a long time, but she\u2019s grown on\nme and I applaud the writers for taking her\ncharacter down a more serious path this sea-son, thus allowing the audience to appreciate\nher acting even more. Josh Radnor as Ted is\na great fit, although he\u2019s my least favourite\ncharacter \u2013 but this has nothing to do with\nthe actor portraying\nhim.\nAs I mentioned at\nt h e\nb e g i n -ning of this\narticle, the last\nepisode of the\nseason aired this\nweek and brought\nwith it a revelation that audiences\nhave been waiting for since this\ntime last year. With\nan ending like that, I\ncan\u2019t wait for season\neight this September.\nAll this being said, if you\nhaven\u2019t yet watched this\nseries, the end of exams\nand the beginning of summer is a great opportunity to do so.\nI guarantee it will\nbe legen \u2013 wait for\nit \u2013 dary!\nBetter than Friends?\nExams, what exams? Go on, write us\na review, you know you want to. Drop\nus an email at tv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nFriday 18 may 2012\n14\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment Editors: Tim Arbabzadah\nSam Horti\nCOMMENT\nThe puzzling problem with ponderings\nI\n\u2019m in the grips of a dilemma. Oh\ndear.\nBut yet I\u2019m strangely glad: I\nlike being in trouble; I like having a problem to solve. This\nmay sound odd. After all, if I\u2019m content\nwith my situation, is there even a problem at all? Technically, no. But I\u2019m not\ncontent with my situation, that\u2019s why\nthere\u2019s a problem \u2013 what I\u2019m glad of is\nhaving the problem. Confused yet? So\nam I. Is your left arm tingling and do\nyou feel a bit nauseous too? No? Oh,\nmust be just me then.\nThere are a few reasons why I enjoy a good dilemma. For one thing, it\nkeeps me busy. They say idle hands are\nthe devil\u2019s playthings and this is true.\nBut hands can only do so many things.\nThey\u2019re practical, yes, but they lack\nimagination. But the mind is limitless\nin its possibility and an idle mind is capable of no end of trouble. If idle hands\nare the devil\u2019s playthings, they must be\nlike Hotwheels. An idle mind then is\nlike handing the devil the keys to his\ndad\u2019s Ferrari.\nBut it\u2019s more than that. If I were\nwithout a problem to mull over, a\nmental crumb stuck between the teeth\nof my consciousness to tongue relent-lessly, I\u2019m quite sure I would get bored\nvery quickly. And as a good medic,\nI know that the brain is a muscle \u2013 I\ndidn\u2019t say I was a smart medic \u2013 and\nlike any muscle, if you don\u2019t use it, you\nlose it. Like a large proportion of Imperial College, I have vested interest in\nkeeping my mind in peak mental condition and nothing keeps it in shape like\na tough, tricksy teaser. It\u2019s like a good\nround on the bench-press, except without the sweating, straining and short,\nshort shorts in public.\nAnd then there\u2019s the perfect joy that\ncomes when the veil of fog lifts, the fish\nscales fall away and at once, with the\nutmost clarity, you can see the solution\nbefore your eyes. It\u2019s all so simple \u2013\nhow you didn\u2019t see before is a mystery,\nbut that becomes irrelevant when you\nmarvel at the beauty of it. The giddy\neuphoria you feel is twofold; not only\nhave you done away that pesky thorn\nin your paw but because you worked it\nthrough all by yourself, it feels doubly\ngood. In that strange microcosm of life\nthat is the morning commute on the\nPiccadilly line, completing the sudoku\nis as the sweetest ambrosia. We haven\u2019t\ncreated the drugs \u2013 or the words \u2013 yet to\nproperly describe the high that comes\nwith the mythical feat of cracking the\ncryptic crossword.\nA problem is also a reminder that\nthings can be better. In this sense, predicaments show there is still room for\nimprovement, which is great! No matter how good today is, knowing that tomorrow can be better still is something\nworth getting out of bed for. Arguably, if life were perfect, without even\nthe smallest of problems, then things\ncould only go downhill \u2013 which itself\nis quite the conundrum! Society only\nmoves forward to get past its successive problems. Stone tablets were great\nbut a bit heavy so we invented paper.\nHandwritten books were OK but mass\ndissemination was a bit tricky so we\ncreated the printing press. Sexy women\nare sexy but they don\u2019t like talking to\nus much in bars so the chat-up line was\nborn.\nAnd the dilemma that spurred all of\nthis? Should I really write an article\nabout dilemmas? On reflection, I don\u2019t\nthink so.\nRhys Davies\nH\nas it ever occurred to you\njust how much of our\nmodern lives are lived\nvia screens? I am sitting here writing this on\nmy laptop, which has been switched on\never since I decided to watch a cheeky\nepisode of Green Wing over breakfast.\nMy mobile phone has been within a two\nmetre radius of my person all day. My\nhousemates and I are considering popping to the cinema later. No doubt the\nlectures I will attend this week will be\nconducted via a projector screen. Even\nif I wanted to escape, I would no doubt\nbe bombarded with screens and monitors in supermarkets, tube stations, and\neven just walking innocently down the\nstreet.\nMy question is whether this is a bad\nthing? Should we be worried about our\never-increasing reliance on this virtual\nworld? When a seven-year old has a tantrum on the tube because she has been\nforced to wait three seconds too long for\nher top-of-the-range mp3 player, I think\nthere may be something wrong.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, modern technology has the potential to enrich our lives\nin countless ways.

Perhaps even to the\nextent that we are actually afraid if we\nare out of contact with our virtual lives.\nA recent article published in the Telegraph (who am I kidding, I read the\nEvening Standard version) states that\ntwo thirds of the UK population suffer\nfrom this fear, one aspect of which has\nbeen catchily termed nomophobia (no\nmobile phobia, officially defined as fear\nof losing or being without your mobile\nphone). If you delve further into the re-sults, 77% of 18-24 year olds (that\u2019s us)\nare nomophobic; and women are a little\nmore afraid than men, however this is\nreportedly only because men tend to\nhave a second spare phone knocking\nabout. The problem has become so terribly grave that an advice website has\nbeen launched to help people cope with\nthe extreme stress and anxiety caused\nby this condition. Even though the site\nis extremely basic and low-budget, I\u2019m\nalmost entirely sure that it\u2019s not in fact\na piss-take. Instead of giving pointers\non getting these people some seriously\nneeded perspective into their lives, the\n\u2018Top Tips\u2019 section on nomophobia.\ncom offers \u201csome immediate protection from nomophobia by [avoiding] a\nrange of the most common reasons why\npeople lose mobile phone contact\u201d.\nI was in fact recently in the unfortunate situation of being without a phone\nfor a few weeks. My poor faithful brick\nof a phone, so sturdy and reliable up until that point, lost a fight with a pint of\nFosters and never recovered. Now for\nthe first few days I was indeed in a mild\nstate of shock and feeling horrendously\ndisconnected from the world, but after a while my sense of panic began to\ndiminish. I started arranging to meet\npeople at specific times and places, instead of the usual \u201ccall me when you get\nthere\u201d. I spent more time on Facebook,\nas a result, sure, but once I was out and\nabout I did feel a certain sense of the\nliberation that technophobes and hippies are always banging on about. Instead of thinking about my phone all the\ntime, whether I had a message or a no-tification, I was actually listening to the\npeople I was with. Instead of burying\nmy nose in my mobile while on the bus,\nGood news: we got a great picture.\nBad news: someone in the Felix office needs a new phone. Sorry...\nI was recently\nwithout a phone...\nonce I was out and\nabout I did feel\na certain sense\nof liberation that\ntechnophobes and\nhippies are always\nbanging on about\n\u201d\ne always\ne always\nn about\nabout\n\u201c\nI was r\nI was r\nwithou\nwithou\nI would read a book on the way home,\nor just take time to look around or out of\nthe window. It was on one of these occasions that I realised that a total of five\npeople out of the nine in the back seat\nof the bus were glued to iPhones, even\na pensioner who looked like she could\nbarely see. And I wondered: are these\npeople actually doing something meaningful on those phones? Or are they\njust filling time by browsing pointless\nwebsites or messaging people unneces-sarily? Because now that I have finally\ngot round to replacing my phone, those\nare the things I\u2019ve gone back to doing\non my boring bus rides home. And although I\u2019m feeling better connected, I\nkind of hope that I will never become a\nnomophobic.\nElen Newcombe\n\n"

Town halls were occupied\nas the budgets detailing the severity of\nthe cuts were passed, half a million people marched in London and hundreds of\ntax dodging stores were occupied by the\ndirect action group UK Uncut. But recently this anger has all died away and\nturned to disengagement as grown men\ndressed as penguins get higher votes\nthan the Lib Dems in local elections\nwhich less than a third of the population\neven bothered to show up to (if we\u2019d all\nrocked out maybe the penguin would\nhave won).\nMaybe this is because we\u2019ve realised\n\u201cthere is no alternative\u201d and decided to\nstand down and bear the government\nausterity. However with the Institute of\nFiscal Studies reporting that only 25%\nof cuts have actually happened yet, and\nwith the professed economic growth\nnot wanting to appear, the pain has\nbarely begun. On top of this, over the\nlast 3 years the wealth of the 1000 richest people increased by \u00a3155bn, greater\nthan the deficit over this time. This is\na mocking fact destroying any possible\nperception that in any way we could\neven slightly be \u201call in it together\u201d as\nthe wealthiest amass pointless fortunes\nwhilst the services for the poorest are\nruthlessly closed.\nNext Saturday (the 26th) the anger\nthat begun the anti-austerity movement\nwill mature into the need to celebrate\nthe future we could have had. UK Uncut has promised a summer of anti-cuts\nstreet parties kicking off next weekend\nPost exams party against austerity\nin 10 different cities from Central London to Middlesbrough. With the Jubilee\nand Olympics fast approaching, and the\nprediction that we should all be told to\nhold good old community street parties\nlike we were for the royal wedding last\nyear, UK Uncut want us to show there\nare more important things to come\ntogether for as central roads will be\nclosed by thousands of people.\nThe last time the deficit was as high\nwas post war, a time also of street par-ties. But it was also a time of progress\nas the NHS was formed, welfare support began and truly affordable housing\nwas actually being built. With this came\na rapidly shrinking inequality gap between the richest and poorest and with\nthat a closing difference in education\nand health. Now health inequalities are\nat a level not seen since the 1920s with\nmen in Glasgow living on average 13\nyears less than those of our surrounding\nKensington and Chelsea.\nThe central London street party will\nbe leaving at 11am on Saturday the 26th\nfrom four different locations, highlighting four different areas that are being\ndecimated by the government unnec-essarily, to then convene on a secret\nlocation (see the UK uncut website for\ndetails). There will be a bloc representing the NHS, which is being turned\ninto a machine for corporate profit by\nthe NHS reforms whilst having cuts\nequivalent to the budgets of 40 large\nNHS hospitals. There is one for wom-en, to highlight how the cuts are falling\nhardest on women, through higher un-employment, the closure of children\u2019s\nservices and crisis centres as well as\nbenefit cuts.\nThe welfare group will leave from\nWaterloo to make a stand against the\nunprecedented welfare cuts. This is\ntimely, with it leaking last week that\nCameron is planning to magic an extra\n\u00a325 billion pounds out of the already\nbare budget. The idea of attacking the\nwelfare budget when there\u2019s such high\nunemployment defies logic. How can\npeople relinquish their \u201cdependency\u201d\non welfare when there are simply no\njobs to do so? People don\u2019t seem to\nunderstand the alternative to welfare is\nmass starvation.\nAnd finally the real democracy bloc\nwill meet at parliament. The Tories\npromised during the election they would\nlook after the NHS to then promptly\nstart the process of ripping it apart days\nlater; whilst not even allowing us to\nsee the risk register detailing the travesty they will leave behind. Combined\nwith this their unwillingness to engage\nin criticism through withdrawing legal\naid and their avoidance of Freedom of\nInformation requests whilst they take\npayments off big business and maintain\ncosy relationships with the corporate\nmedia mafia has lead to the true deficit\nbeing one in democracy.\nThis may not seem much to party\nabout, but then that\u2019s all the more reason to carnival with the idea of the society that we want. Poverty and inequality are not facts of society to which\nthere is no alternative, but something\npeople have changed before and will\nchange again! And so I invite you to\none of the four starting locations to join\nin standing up to the cuts. People will\ndescend on the final secret location with\ngames, comedy, food to share, a vision\nof the future not dependent on kicking\nthe poorest the hardest, music and most\nimportantly... bunting.\nPoverty and\ninequality are not\nfacts of society...\nbut something\npeople have\nchanged before\nand will change\nagain\n\u201c\nPoverty\nPoverty\ninequa\ninequa\n\u201d\nange\nange\nLuke Sheldon\nSkrillex won\u2019t be there, but if there is a YouTube video of the party there\u2019s\nsure to be a comment about how he \u201csucks major donkey dick\u201d\nGive Boris bikes a chance\nI\nshould be on Transport for London\u2019s pay roll. Why? Because the\ntimes that I have helped people\nrelease bikes from Boris\u2019 blue\nstands are innumerable. The people requiring assistance are mostly tour-ists, whom I often have little patience\nwith. So what is it that makes their plight\nso important to me?\nI love Boris bikes, but I\u2019m the first to\nadmit that there is nothing user friendly about them; I can\u2019t stand the sight\nof people excitedly parting with their\nmoney only to get stuck trying to release a bike. The first stumbling block,\nof course, is conveying your credit or\ndebit card details. This acts as a sort of\ndeposit. If you\u2019re American and don\u2019t\nown a card with a chip in it, you\u2019re stuck\nimmediately. Even if you do have a chip\nin your card, the machine can take a disliking to it \u2013 my debit card falls into this\ncategory. If you\u2019re lucky though, you\u2019ll\nbe issued with a bicycle release and then\nhave a limited amount of time to grab a\nbike. Sounds easy doesn\u2019t it? Well, the\nproblem is that if a bike has a red light\nilluminated by it, it will NEVER be re-leased, no matter how many times you\ncorrectly type in the code. Pushing in a\npound coin where the membership key is\nsupposed to go doesn\u2019t help either. Since\nno one ever seems to grasp these things\nfirst time, this results in many an unaided\ntourist\u2019s downfall.\nIf TfL were ever to recognise my services to Boris bikes, I would use it as an\nopportunity to air my views about buses.\nIf I get on one of these splendid vehicles\nand it says it\u2019s going to Battersea Bridge\nSouth Side, only to tell me two stops\nlater that it\u2019s changed its final destination\nto somewhere I could have easily walked\nto in half the amount of time, I get angry.\nThis happens to me too frequently and I\nknow the drill. You end up paying twice.\nThere surely is an easy way around this,\nfor instance they could issue you with\na slip allowing you to get on the next\nbus for free. And provide free coffee for\nthose poor people who tried the bus only\nafter the bikes failed them\u2026\nSo, should we bother dwindling our\nmoney on buses and bikes? In this ever-persistent rain, buses\u2019benefits surely outweigh their short fallings. But come the\nsummer, whenever that may be, do try\nto get a Boris bike. If you\u2019re successful:\ncycle through the park along the south of\nthe Serpentine, west to east. Yes it is like\nthe M25 at rush hour, but at other times it\nis one of the most scenic and best experiences TfL has to offer.\nStephanie Walton\nDear Sir,\nI would like to nominate Professor Chris Toumazou FRS\nFREng for the vacant position\nof President of Imperial College and Professor Donnal\nBradley CBE FRS for Provost.\nChris is a front man with great\npeople skills and would be ideal for the external affairs role.\nDonnal has the right blend\nof academic and managerial\nexperience for the internal affairs portfolio.\nYours faithfully,\nMark Lee\nMaterials (1986-1989)\nLetter to the Editor\nSend your pieces in to:\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nFriday 18 MAY 2012\n22\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm Editors: John Park\nLucy Wiles\nFILM\nDepp & Burton: a match made in heaven\nDark Shadows, currently out in cinemas, marks the eighth collaborative effort between one of Hollywood\u2019s most versatile, talented leading men \u2013 Johnny Depp \u2013 with his boss/friend/director \u2013 Tim\nBurton. And in honouring their batch of wonderfully weird, eerily eccentric movies, Felix Film takes\na look at their lengthy filmography\n5. Corpse Bride (2005)\nBurton had always been interested in the animation genre, given his involvement in various projects such as The Nightmare\nBefore Christmas, James and the Giant Peach, and Mars Attacks!\nbut his first full-length, stop-motion film came with this one.\nAfter a wedding proposal practice in the woods goes wrong, an\nunlucky groom-to-be (Depp) unwittingly gets himself engaged to\na corpse bride (Helena Bonham Carter). He\u2019s not so sure about\nthis sudden development, but she appears to be hopelessly\ndevoted to him. There are bizarre yet charming moments as the\nunlikely couple start sharing a genuine connection.\n1. Edward Scissorhands (1990)\nIt started back here with Depp and Burton, with Depp being cast\nin his debut Burton role after Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, Robert\nDowney Jr., and William Hurt were all considered for the role. The\ntransformation Depp undergoes may frighten some, but there\nis a much richer, incredibly touching love story that runs under\nthe tale of an artificial creation with scissors for its hands. Burton was initially unfamiliar with Depp\u2019s previous roles but thank\nheavens the quiet yet sympathy-arousing Depp was chosen for\nthe role. Because without this feature, there might not have been\nthe 7 more films from this unique pairing.\n4. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005)\nLeave it to Burton to turn a beloved childhood bedtime story\ninto a visually dazzling, somewhat creepy adaptation. Aside from\nthe fact that Depp looks like a disturbing man-child luring children into his enormous factory, Burton\u2019s family-friendly outing is\na vibrant, colourful and energetic piece of work that works despite the lead actor\u2019s distracting performance. One of the main\nstrengths here is the young Freddie Highmore, who was picked\nafter Depp\u2019s recommendation (the two had previously worked\ntogether in Finding Neverland), in the role of Charlie, providing\nthe effective, sweet, central emotional core.\n7. Alice in Wonderland (2010)\nArguably the weakest offering from the Depp/Burton team,\nwhile you cannot deny the oddly brilliant portrayal of The\nMad Hatter from the consistently reliable Depp (but the less\nthat is said of that silly little dance at the end, the better),\nBurton\u2019s portrayal of Wonderland, and Alice\u2019s (a blank Mia\nWasikowska) pointless adventures feel strangely detached,\nowing to the plodding pace and repetitive plot strands. The\nwonky 3D conversion, combined with the uninspired script\nand a disappointing final showdown, make for an uninvolv-ing fantasy outing.\n6. Sweeney Todd (2007)\nThe current outstanding production playing at West End might\nsomewhat diminish the efforts from Burton\u2019s first and only musical but his stylishly bloody and darkly witty adaptation that frankly lacks a single memorable tune is still an impressive one, making singers out of actors. Depp, filled with anger and vengeance,\nslashes the throats of anyone who gets in his way, whereas Helena Bonham Carter completes the perfect crime by making pies\nout of the bodies. Sounds horrific, and it is, which is exactly what\nyou would expect from Burton.\n2. Ed Wood (1994)\nOften dubbed \u201cthe worst director of all time,\u201d Ed Wood (Depp)\nwas known for his low-budget genre films and failed to win over\nthe respect of the industry, but following the release of a biography that shed new light on his life, career, and love for cinema,\nhe was given new-found appreciation. Filmed in black-and-white,\ndealing with a long-forgotten story must have contributed to why\nthis barely made its mark at the box-office despite its strong\ncritical acclaim. Still, Martin Landau deservingly won his Best\nSupporting Actor Oscar in his role as Bela Lugosi, a frequent collaborator of Wood later in his acting career.\n3. Sleepy Hollow (1999)\nSevered heads, witchcraft, humour, this combination can only\nbe the work of Burton and Depp. After a vengeful headless warrior arises to brutally decapitate individuals in a small village,\nan off-beat forensic investigator (Depp) is sent to the town of\nSleepy Hollow to track down this haunting creature. What he\ndigs up is a community full of disputes, family troubles, backstabbing and even more decapitation than he\u2019d anticipated.\nBurton\u2019s gothic crime thriller has its moments of gore, shock\nvalue and paying homage to the traditional films of the Hammer\nFilms Productions, his visuals also received a lot of praise.\n\n"

    "content": "Starcraft: the Revolution of eSports\nT\nhe lights of the metropolis shine\nbrightly on the clear summer night.\nDown on the bay, a crowd gathers\naround a giant outdoor screen. Spotlights flood the area as the audience,\nnow exceeding 50,000 people, work themselves\ninto a fever pitch. The two teams come out on\nstage to deafening cheers. Teenage girls scream\nas one idol from each team is chosen for the first\nround of combat. They each enter a booth. The\nmusic swells, and the video game begins.\n\u201cIt sounds like a science fiction story from the\nfuture. But this event actually happened in the\npast, in a place where such things have been commonplace for over ten years. This was the 2006\nProleague finals held in Seoul, South Korea. The\ngame being played was StarCraft.\u201d \u2014 The Dawn\nof Starcraft, eSports comes to the world stage, by\nJeremy Reimer, arstechnica.\nStarcraft was released in March 1998, closely\nfollowed by several expansions with the third and\nfinal release in November 1998. Together, they\nwould become an all-time best-selling game for\nthe PC, with 11 million copies sold worldwide.\nThe game is a sci-fi real-time strategy game, with\nthree distinct races that can be played. It is said to\nhave revolutionized the standards for RTS games,\nperhaps due to the insane skills required to compete at the top level. It triggered the creation of\nthe world\u2019s first major eSports (electronic-sports)\ntournaments starting in 2002 in South Korea, and\nspreading throughout the world today.\nStarcraft II: Wings of Liberty is the long-awaited\nsequel, released on July 10th 2010. It follows the\nsame lore as its predecessor, seeing major changes\nin only the outdated graphics and speed. Certain\nunits were removed, added, or altered drastically,\nbut the mechanics of the game remain untouched.\nThere are several elements of the game to mas-ter; conceptually simple, but extraordinarily difficult to do all at once. Like most RTS games,\nplayers build armies and fight to kill their opponent \u2014 but the resources the players are required\nto gather are spread about the map, and you can\u2019t\nsee what your opponent is doing unless you scout\nthem out.\nFELIX\nFriday 18 may 2012\n26\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nGames Editor: Laurence Pope\nGAMES\nEconomic balance is vital. You need enough\nworkers to maintain a high income, and the gathered resources must all be intelligently spent.\nDecision-making is the most crucial part of the\ngame\u2014 choose what buildings to invest in to produce the right army composition to engage at the\nbest time in the most advantageous way.\nAll the above is referred to as \u201cmacro\u201d\u2014 anything that involves considering the overall game\nand maintaining a good play. Its counterpart is\n\u201cmicro\u201d, which focuses on the intense second-by-second unfurling of game-changing battles. There\nis a lot to do in any one battle: certain units have\nabilities toggled by hotkey and must be cast in the\nright place at the right time, target-firing powerful units to minimize damage taken, and splitting\ngroups of units to avoid splash attack damage.\nSo far, you might be asking the question, why\nis it different to any other RTS? Well, there are\nthree main elements to this. The first is its fully\nintegrated multiplayer ladder system. All players\nare given a rank in a league, and winning games\nin multiplayer allows you to climb the ladder and\neventually be promoted. There are seven leagues\nfrom bronze to Grand Masters \u2013 GM being the top\n200 in a region.\nThe second is the game\u2019s ongoing development.\nStarcraft is constantly being tested and developed,\nwith changes made following the evolution of the\nmetagame. Patches are brought in to maintain the\n\u201cbalance\u201d, making sure no single strategy is too\n\u201coverpowered\u201d.\nThe third is the satisfaction received from Starcraft 2 as a spectator sport.At eSports tournaments,\nhundreds of professional players pit themselves\nagainst each other in a thrilling battle of wits,\npushing their skills to the limit. The matches are\nshown live, with audiences hundreds of thousands\nstrong, all over the world, watching the game un-fold. Accompanying this is play-by-play commentary by knowledgeable and entertaining casters,\nwho expertly blend enthusiasm and comedy into\nevery event. There are over 30 tournaments a year;\nthe largest ones offer a prize pot of up to $120,000.\nIn the games, there are countless preparations a\nplayer can make in order to surprise their oppo-nent. Usually, this makes the player more vulnerable to attack. There is a high-pressure excitement\n\u201cThere are over 30\ntournaments a year; the\nlargest ones offer a prize\npot of up to $120,000.\u201d\nTwo enemies set aside their differences to fight off an advancing Zerg Swarm\ngenerated from knowing something the players\ndon\u2019t \u2013 in your head, you scream \u201cAttack NOW,\nbefore his advantage kicks in, now is your ONLY\nopportunity!\u201d Every moment is packed with dramatic tension, because any moment could decide\nthe game.\nThe other factor is the strategic brilliance of\nthe players. In the game, intelligence and preparation are by far the most important attributes of\nthe players. High-level play is full of mind games.\nProfessional competitors will study their rivals\u2019\nplay styles months in advance in order to find and\nexploit the smallest of weaknesses. The \u201cwow\u201d\nfactor is in the stunning decision-making and outsmarting of your opponent, with each player having a unique approach to the game.\nTo celebrate this wonderful world of Starcraft,\nImperial\u2019s own Starcraft Society was formed earlier this year as a sub-society of Gaming. We have\nheld six tournament and screening events so far,\neach incredibly entertaining and successful. The\nmost fantastic aspect is just having a community,\nbeing able to discuss and participate in a game you\nlove, with others who share that feeling. Furthermore, there exists a Collegiate Star League where\nuniversities all over Europe compete on Starcraft.\nAn Imperial team was formed at the start of this\nacademic year, by Ben Thomas, a first-year Physicist. We placed third this season, out of 22 teams\nincluding Oxbridge and University of London.\nSo, if you feel you wanna get involved in an\nawesome game with an awesome society, join our\nFacebook group \u201cImperial Starcraft Society\u201d, and\ncome along to our next event, a live screening of\na pro-tournament, MLG Spring Arena 2! Hosted\nby ICU Cinema Society, we will be in the Union\nConcert Hall this weekend from 5.00pm Saturday\nand 5.30pm Sunday. The tournament is hosted in\nAmerica, so they will go on until the early hours\nof morning, pop by whenever to catch a glimpse of\nthe eSports phenomenon!\nCarol Yang discusses why Starcraft has become such a phenomenal success\nThe audience of the Starcraft: Brood War Proleague finals in Seoul, South Korea, 2006\n\u201c\nFighterforum\n\n"

The total capacity\nof the event was 2,045. Tickets were\nsold through the box office at The\nTroxy as well as via Time Out, KGB\n(an organisation that sells tickets, not\nthe Russian secret service \u2013 unless they\nare moonlighting in a sushi restaurant,\nwhich they aren\u2019t), in physical form\nto family and friends of the performers and organisers, and available for\npurchase on the door. The box office\ntickets were night specific; the other\npre-event tickets were not. For the Saturday show, 362 tickets were sold with\nSunday garnering 236 ticket sales by\nthe box office. Time Out and KGB ticket sales were 38 and 95/96 (which of\nthe numbers is still not known) respec-tively.

Of the night specific tickets, 17\nand 14 tickets were bought on the door\non Saturday and Sunday respectively.\nFusion has been planned since before\nthe start of this academic year. Over\nthe summer, the incoming Sabbatical\nofficers were made aware of the event\nby the previous year\u2019s officers and\nMonya Zard, Deputy President (Clubs\n& Societies) had regular meetings with\nAngela Udemba. Monya Zard said\nthat Fusion had a \u201ctremendous amount\nof support\u201d from the Union, with her\nand Michael Foster, Deputy President\n(Finances & Services) having regular\nmeetings with Fusion (namely Angela\nUdemba, Heather Jones and Chris\nDarby \u2013 the producer of the event,\nwho eventually dropped out). Before\nChristmas, after the Masquerade Ball,\nFusion and the Union had a meeting\nto discuss \u201cmitigating risk and set up\na timescale for how and when [they\nwould] meet ticket sales targets\u201d. The\ntargets were not met.\nWhen searching for reasons for the\nfailure of the event and the low ticket\nsales, many different possible problems were given. Monya Zard said that\nit was \u201clocation, the fact that there\u2019s so\nmuch to do in London, and that there\nwere other shows going on at the same\ntime\u201d. The distance of the venue was\ndismissed, as The Troxy has worked\nwell in the past. The price of the tickets\n(\u00a318-40) was also blamed, as possibly\nputting students off buying a ticket.\nThe fact that the main show took place\nat the same time as many of the other\nbig societies were having their annual\nevents (such as East Meets West, M\nNight, and I Night) was also pointed to\nas a contributing factor. Also, Monya\nZard said that it may not have had \u201can\nestablished member base, but it did\nhave 150 people who were trying to\nsell tickets\u201d and so could have been as\nsuccessful as M Night and other similar events, which have an almost guaranteed base attendance. She dismissed\nthis possible factor as \u201cnot necessarily\nthe reason why the ticket sales were\nlow\u201d. When asked why the event was\nsuccessful in York and not successful\nin London, Monya Zard said that it\nwas due to the difference in the entertainment scenes of the two cities, with\nthere being much more variety in London.\nThe Masquerade Ball was described\nas a \u201cmassive party\u201d, which a large\namount of people enjoy. The main\nevent was a show, which was suggested to the Union to be not as in tune\nwith what manner of event students\nrealistically like to attend. This suggestion was dismissed, with the examples\nof M Night and others previously mentioned used to justify that the structure\nwas sound.\nThe original treasurer had to drop\nout, due to work commitments, and so\nHeather Jones, former Deputy President (Clubs & Societies) stepped in.\nShe said that she was \u201csurprised that\nsuch an ambitious budget had been\napproved\u201d. The reason given by the\nUnion for such a large scale event being approved was that Angela Udemba\nhad already run an event of a similar\nscale, and that many senior, experience\nmembers of the Union were heavily involved in the planning and execution\nstages. She did, however, comment that\nFusion\u2019s expenditure was \u201cultimately\nunder-budget\u201d. Heather Jones stated\nthat she felt her role as treasurer was\nto: \u201censure the budget passed by A&E\nExec (the board that govern activities\nand entertainments) was adhered to\u201d.\nAccording to her, the task of managing\nso many transactions was difficult, and\nmade much harder by the \u201climitations\nof the Union finance systems\u201d.\nFusion does not consider the event to\nhave been a complete failure and will\nbe hoping to continue. If the event goes\nahead next year it will have to start\nfrom the loss it has made and hope to\nmake the money back. There may be an\nafterparty, or some other such similar\nevent, to attempt to make back some of\nthe money.\nFelix will be trying to find out what\nsafeguards will be put in place to ensure similar loses are not incurred by\nother events, such as the upcoming\nSummer Ball.\nGraphic showing the filled seats (green) and empty seats (red)\n\n"
