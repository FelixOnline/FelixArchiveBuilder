On the other hand, people at\nany standard are welcome and whoever\nwants Ohm's Law will get it!) followed by\nQuestions and Answers, in which you\nask the questions and the \"teacher\" is\nunable to give the answers.\nAnyone who wants to learn a bit about\nradio is very welcome to come along,\nwhether they intend to take the exam or\nnot. A pass qualifies you a radio\ntransmitting license.\nA listing of the talks is printed out\nbelow. They are of course FREE, but if\nyou would like a set of printed notes, we\nwill have to charge to recover\nduplicating costs.\nJanuary 16th Becoming a Radio\nAmateur.

On a lighter note, entertainments this\nterm include a private tour to the\nScience Museum transmitting station\n(please bring your own jemmy and black\nboot polish). This will give us an\nexcellent opportunity to look at worn out\nold equipment used by the first\ngeneration of radio amateurs. Rather\nlike an afternoon in the shack, really.\nAccording to Russell, they have some\nexcellent examples of the stone-age\nforbear of the modern monolithic\nmicrochip: megalithic macro chips( but I wouldn't take him too seriously if I were\nyou \u2014 I don't think they could get\nStonehenge up the escalators).\nAlso on this term's menu is a talk on\nsatellite communications, and of course\nyour valiant committee is working round\nthe clock to fix up other thrills for your\ndelectation, so keep half an eye on your\nletter rack, half on the \"What'sOn\" column and half on the rest of FELIX,\nand you'll not miss out.\nSee you up in the Shack,\n73's for now,\nG8R RD. CANOE CLUB\nLast term Canoe Club had three very\nsuccessful weekend trips. The first to\nthe River Wye was primarily for the new\npaddlers in the club, but one stretch was\nalso paddled by the members with some\nexperience. The trip was well supported\nand many new members were encouraged by their success.\nThe second to the River Usk was\nslightly disappointing due to the lack of\nwater, but good weather meant that we\nwere able to spend more time on the\nwater than normal.\nWe ended the term with a surfing trip\nto Bude. We were fortunate to have\nsome sun while paddling, although it\nrained for most of the rest of the time.\nThose surfing for the first time soon got\nthe hang of it, and everyone thoroughly\nenjoyed themselves in the excellent surf.\nFor this term the first trip is on the 26th and 27th of January to the River Dart, a river we are not able to visit frequently,\nso a trip not to be missed. We hope to\nhave a second t river tr in in mid-February. The final trip will be to Bude\non the 8th and 9th of March. It is also\nhoped some Saturday trips will be\narranged to Shepperton Werr. Finally do\nnot forget the pool sessions on Tuesday\nevenings (6:30\u20148:00) in the swimming\npool and Stan's Bar after 8:30.\nRCS SOCCER SIXES\nSunday 27th January\nTeams names to Mo Misra via\nUnion Off/Chem Dept before\nTuesday 22nd January.\nWANTED: One Mohican red Indian.

I would advise all members to book a period\nas soon as possible: There's nothing\nnicer than to play on a new, silky,\npure wool cloth. It would be nice to\nkeep the cloth in this condition: on the\npart of the committee, we will 'brush\nthe tables every day and mow them\ntwice a week; for your part, please\ncover the table when you have finished, and please refrain from smoking over the table, or placing\nglasses on it.\nAt present the 'A','B', and ' C teams\nare first, third and second respectively\nin the league.\nWe have three trips planned for\nFebruary:\n1. Benson and Hedges Masters, Wembley, 5th \u20149th February.\n2. UK Professional Billiards Champ ions Leeds 10th \u201417th February.\n3.

    "content": "Film Review\nMONSTER FROM THE BLACK HOLE starring NING YANG HO YU FU LUNG\nand LI CHI WONG as ZOE Zoe Upon the altars of the ancient Chinese temples burned a mystic fire - ever\ntended by the vestal virgin. To this sacred flame were added special fragrances\n\u2022 incense of careful blending. What hidden value had those aromas? Was there\na mystical significance to the passive atmosphere they created?\nVirginity as a form of morality was elevated to a divine status accounting for\nthe widespread practice of assigning special temple duties to young girls who\nhad been selected for their chastity.\nLegend relates that Fu-hsi; the founder of the Chinese empire, was the son\nof a virgin who ate a flower which had clung to her garments when bathing.\nAmongst the young Chinese virgins there was one named Zarathustra. She\nlusted for a man whenever she bathed in the aroma of the incense from the\nsacred flame. One night her lust was satisfied. In a poetically erotic moment\nZarathustra is taken by a muscular temple guard. During their ec stacy one\nsees flashes of his body, shining with sacred oils, as he makes love to her in a giant oyster-shell supported by a column of marble.\nTime passes and Zarathustra's child is born in a shadowy glade. As the baby\nmakes its first sounds; her mother screams in terror. There before her lay a baby girl but, because she had broken her virginity, God had made her pay an\nawful price. The baby was a monster with four eyes, a nose for a mouth and lips\nin the top of its head, (see above inset photo)\nZarathustra carefully tended the child and named her Zoe. Zoe was made a prisoner in the gardens of the temple and was never allowed to meet anyone.\nTwenty years later .... Zoe stumbled on a group of witches who were\nperforming a naked ritual. Zoe was caught and satanically sacrificed. The film\ncontains many special effects but the moment when Zoe ascends to the stars is\nthe most brilliant effect in the film. Sucked up towards the swirling heavens\nZoe is drawn towards a black hole. She emerges after travelling through a time\nwarp that has advanced her through many centuries.\nZoe has gained special powers. She has been armed with four laser eyes. A space craft speeds towards Zoe and a terrific battle ensues. Zoe tries to defend\nherself from the ferocious attacks of the craft but can she survive? Is this film\nthe ultimate in sci-fi satire? You'll feel sorry for the four eyed monster ....\nWatch Out she is coming to get you!\nColin Palmer\nINDUSTRIAL SOCIETY\nFind out about this term's events at a CHEESE AND\nWINE lunch in the Senior\nCommon Room on Tuesday\n15th January at 1:00pm.( Membership only 30p.)

    "content": "Royal\nSchool\noff\nMining &\nMetallurgical\nSociety\nROBERT N PRYOR\nMEMORIAL LECTURE\nthe Mining and Metallurgical Society is sponsoring the First Annua\nMemorial Lecture to the late Professor Robert N Pryor. The lecture will\nbe given by Sir Mark Turner, Chairman and Chief Executive of Rio\nTlnto Zinc Corporation Ltd, on Monday, 14th January, 1980 at 6:00pm in Mechanical Engineering Lecture Theatre 220. The lecture will be on\nthe topic of International British-based Companies in a Nationalistic\nWorld. All are cordially invited to attend.\nPG TIPS\nOur questionnaire has now been out\nfor a month, so I feel it would be both\ninteresting and instructive to look at the\nresults so far. The response has not been\nearth shattering but with 135 PhD students returning their forms so far, we\ncan identify general trends.\nPerhaps the most surprising feature of\nthe questionnaire is that, of all PhD students who have returned, some 68.1%\nare satisfied with the way their PhD is\ngoing and only 26% are definitely not\nsatisfied. Also, there seems to be a wide\nchasm between students' expectations\nand reality as to how long a PhD actually\ntakes. Some 53.3% thought that they\nwould be finished in three years (total),\nwhereas in fact hardly anybody finishes in\nthree years. Of course, we should not\ndiscourage optimism, but it is disturbing\nthat so few PhD students realize the\nextent of the problem.\nThe \"average\" PhD student spends\n44.2 hours in College per week and works\n5.9 hours at home. This is not surprising:\nit is well understood by most potential\nPhD students that they will need to do\nconsiderably more work than the 35\nhours (and less!) per week that is\ncommonplace in industry.\nThe majority of students (65.9%) felt\nthat they had been given adequate\nsupervision at the start, and only 27.4%\nfelt that they had not. 'Research training*\nemerged as the most popular reason for\ndoing a PhD with 76.3% in favour, but\nthere were some other interesting replies\ngiven to this question: ego trip, mental\nacrobatics, fun etc. The Union is certainly\nnot popular with PGs: 51.9% had no time\nfor it and only 26.7% said that they\ndefinitely did have time.\nThe above conclusions have been\ndrawn from returns so far (14.5% of all\nPhD students). The full results of the\nquestionnaire will appear in a later edition\nFELIX.\nAs I have already stated, the response\nhas not been that good and it would be\nextremely useful to receive many more\ncompleted answers. There is an opportunity to submit the results of the survey\nto the Working Party into Postgraduate\nEducation, but I would be loath to do this\nwith a representation of only one in\nseven.\nThe response has, in fact, varied quite\nconsiderably between departments, the\nworst offenders being: Aeronautics (0%),\nMech Eng (9.4%) and Chemistry (9%).\nFull marks to the following departments\nfor a well above average response:\nBotany (25%), History of Science and\nTechnology (50%)(an anomaly, I admit!)\nand Physics (24.4%).\nSo, if you still have the form lying\naround, please complete it! Also, there\nwill be a committee meeting of the PG Group in the Green Committee Room\n(Union Building) at 12:30pm on Tuesday\n15th January, which everyone is welcome\nto attend. We will be planning social\nevents for the term.\nFinally, I would like to send many\nthanks to those who have returned the\nquestionnaire with constructive suggestions: these will be studied in detail. This\nresponse has more than offset the\nhaughty \"mind your own business\" replies\nwhich have been received from some\nquarters.\nMINES It's back to the old routine again and\nhere's a brief list of various thing ies that\nare line up for us this term:\nJanuary 14th: Prof RN Pryor Memorial\nLecture. 6:00pm.

I 'll just reiterate that all posters\nbreaking the rules will be taken down and\nmade the people responsible liable to a fine.\nAlso posters affixed to walls can only be\nstuck on with Blu Tac not sell o tape. NIGHTLINE\n\"Someone to talk to\" is at 10 Princes\nGardens. Internal 2468 or 581 2468.\nWHAT HAPPENS AT AUG M The order of things follows the agenda, which\nusually has the format:\n1. Minutes of lasting meeting: Copies of the\nminutes of the last meeting are issued to\neverybody which everybody can check as a 'true\nand accurate record'.\n2. Officers Reports: Officers present reports of\nwhat they've been doing so that you can check\nthat they are doing their job properly \u2014 according\nto their job description and following any specific\ninstructions that have been requested by\nprevious UG Ms. Once a report has been presented people are\nfree to question anything they do not understand\nor make a request to enlarge upon a particular\nsection. Questions are always invited to a report.\nIf you are not satisfied with a report because\nyou feel an officer has not acted correctly or\nbecause it is insufficient, then, you can move that\nit be 'referred back'. This means that the U GM is\ndissatisfied with the action or lack of it taken by\nthat officer.\nMOTIONS Once the reports are out of the way, what is\nusually the most controversial part of the meeting\nstarts \u2014 the motions. These can and do refer to\nalmost anything \u2014 external and internal to the\ncollege. How they are dealt with is defined strictly\nin the standing orders. Anybody can propose one\nof these to a Union meeting as long as he/she can\nfind a second er, as long as they do it at least\nseven days before the U GM, after that they\nappear at the chair person's discretion s. A proposal speech comes first, after that\namendments are taken. Again anybody can\npropose an amendment, and if there are no\nfurther rounds of speeches a vote.\nIf the amendment is defeated\neverybody forgets about it. Either way we now\nmove onto the next amendment (only one\namendment can be discussed at a time) and so on\nUntil all amendments are dealt with (or until a move to vote is passed). There is then usually a speech against; a summing up speech for; after\nwhich a vote is immediately taken on the main\nmotion, which if it is passed becomes Union\npolicy.\nAny motion can be passed as long as it does not\ncontradict the ByeLaws( ICUn ion's constitution) or the standing orders.\n20\n\n"

    "content": "ISLAMIC WEEK WHAT ISLAM STANDS FOR Islam ( submission to God) establishes not only peace and\nharmony but also rids mankind of\ntyranny and oppression. The contemporary world presents in\nthis respect no better view than it\ndid fourteen hundred years ago,\nwhen Islam freed it from all false\ngods. Tyranny still on the rampage\nin the guise of haughty kings,\ninsolent demagogues and heartless\ncapitalists who are busy in sucking\nthe blood of millions, subjugating\nthem and making capital out of\ntheir helplessness and misery.\nThere is still another class of\ndictators who rule with sword,\nusurp peoples' liberties and claim\nthat they are merely instruments in\nenforcing the people's or the\nproletariat's will.\n**\u2022\u2022\nIslam brings to an end man's rule\nover man. It makes the rulers as\nmuch subject tot Divine Law as are\nall other men and women. Islam\ndoes not allow any man to subjugate others or impose upon them\nhis will. Only God's commands are\nto be obeyed and only the examples of the Prophets are to be\nfollowed. The ruler, in such a community, shall, as a part of his\nobligations towards men and God, be required to enforce Divine Law\nfailing which he may no longer\nhave any lawful claim to people's obedience. They may in such a situation quite lawfully disregard his\norders. This was explicitly stated\nby the first Caliph Abu Bakr (May\nGod be pleased with him) when he\nsaid that \" Obey me only so long\nas I obey God with respect to you;\nand if I should happen to deviate\nfrom God's obedience, then in that\ncase my obedience shall no longer\nbe incumbent upon you.\" As such\nthe ruler in Islam has no privileged\nright to use the Public Exchequer\nor to formulate state legislation in\ndefiance to the Shari'ah. Moreover\nit is only the trustworthy people\nwho have any right to rule, who\nelected to a post of authority\nthrough a free, just and impartial\nelection with no checks on voters\nsave those of justice, virtue and\ndecency.\nSuch an Islamic State will not\nonly liberate its citizens from all\ntyrants at home but shall safeguard\ntheir freedom against any outside\naggression as well. This is so\nbecause Islam itself is a religion of\nglory and power and as such it\ncannot tolerate that men should\ndegrade themselves by prostrating\nat the feet of the false god of\nImperialism, Islam prescribes a very\nsimple code of life for man. It\nexhorts him to strive hard to gain\npleasure of his Creator, surrender\nhis will to that of his Lord, follow\nHis commandments and come forward with all the sources at his\ndisposal to fight against the spectre\nof Imperialism and tyranny.\nLet Man therefore turn towards\nIslam for this is the time for all\nhuman beings to flock together\nunder its banner so as to wipe out\nfrom the face of the earth all the\nvestiges of Imperialism and exploitation of man by man. Here is the\nway to real freedom, one which\nallows no serfdom, promises all\nmen freedom in thought, action,\nproperty and religion, jealously\nsafeguarding their integrity as well\nas honour.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nISLAMIC REVIVAL It must be well understood that\nIslam is not a mere ideological\nvision. It is a practical system of life\nthat fully appreciates all the\ngenuine needs of mankind and tries\nto realize them.\nIn trying to meet the genuine\nrequirements of man Islam effects a perfect balance between all areas\nof life and activity. It starts with the\nindividual maintaining a balance\nbetween his requirements of body\nand soul, reason and spirit and in\nno case allows one side to predominate the other. It does not |\nsuppress the animal in stic ts in\norder to make the soul ascend the\nhigher planes, nor does it allow\nman, in his efforts to fulfil his bodily\ndesires, to stoop down to the low\nlevel of animalism and hedonism.\nOn the contrary, it makes them\nboth meet on a single higher plane\ndoing away with all the internal\npsychological conflicts that the\nhuman soul is threaten by or set a part of it against the other parts. In\nthe social sphere, it proceeds to\nachieve an equilibrium between the\nneeds of the individual and those of\nthe community. It does not allow\nan i divi dual to trans g rees s against\nother individuals, or against the\ncommunity. Nor does it allow the\ncommunity to comit transgression\nagainst the individual. It also does\nnot approve of one class or group\nof people to enslave another class\nor group of people. Islam exercises\na bene fic i ent constraint on all these\nmutually opposed forces, prevents\nthem from coming into coli sion with one another, and harnesses\nthem all to co-operate for the\ngeneral good of mankind as a whole.\nIslam strikes a balance between\ndifferent sectors of society and\nbetween different aspects of\nexistence, spiritual as well as\nmaterial. Unlike Communism, it\ndoes not believe that economic\nfactors, ie the material aspect\nalone, dominate the human exist-en ce. Nor does it contribute to\nwhat the pure spiritualists or\nidealists say claiming that spiritual\nfactors or high ideals alone are\nsufficient to organize human life.\nIslam rather holds that all these\ndiverse elements put together form\nwhat is called human society; and\nthat the best code of life is that\nwhich takes note of all these,\nmaking full allowance for body as\nwell as reason and spirit and arranging them all in the framework of a harmonious whole.\nThirdly, it must always be kept in\nmind that Islam has an altogether\nindependent existence of its own as\na social philosophy as well as an\neconomic system. Some of its\noutward manifestations may on the\nsurface appear to resemble those\nof Capitalism and Socialism, but in\nfact it is far from being the one or\nthe other. It retains all the good\ncharacteristics of these systems,\nyet is free from their shortcomings\nand perversions. It does not extol\nindividualism to that loath ful extent\nwhich is the characteristic of the\nmodern West. It was from this\ngerm that modern Capitalism sprang and institutionalized that\nconcept of individual's freedom\nwhere man is allowed to exploit\nother individuals and the community only to serve his personal gain.\nIslam guarantees personal freedom\nand provides opportunities for\nindividual enterprise but not at the\ncost of society or ideals of social\ninjustice. Reaction to Capitalism\nhas appeared in the form of\nSocialism. It idolizes the social\nbasis to an extent individuals\nare reduced to insignificant cogs in\nthe social mach ne, with no exist-en ce of its own outside and independent of the herd. Therefore the community alone enjoys\nfreedom as well as power; the\nindividual has no right to question\nits authority or demand his rights.\nThe tragedy of Socialism and its\nvariants is that they assign to the\nstate absolute powers to shape the\nlives of individuals.\nIslam strikes a balance between\nthe two extremes of Capitalism and\nSocialism. Being appreciative of\ntheir role Islam harmonizes t ne individual and the state in such a way that individuals have the\nfreedom necessary to develop their\npotentialities and not to encroach\nupon the rights of their fellow men. It also gives the community and the\nstate adequate powers to regulate\nand control the socio-economic\nrelationships so as to guard and\nmain t aim this harmony in human\nlife. The basis of this whole structure as envisaged by Islam is\nthe reciprocity of love between\nindividuals and groups; it i not\nerected on the basis of hatred and\nclass conflict as is the case with\nSocialism.\nISLAMIC REVIVAL CONTINUED In the light of the above, one can\nbegin to understand why revolutions in Muslim lands are a logical consequence:\nIran: What has happened is a single demonstration (excuse the\npun) of the deep-rooted beliefs at\nwork. Neither the US or Russia\nhad any hand to play. The whole\nworld was taken by surprise at the\nIslamic aspect.\nAfghanistan: Again the forces of\nfaith are rising against the puppet\nrule of Russia.\nThese are two recent examples\nAll sectors of the community in the\nwhole world show their longing to\nlive and be governed according to\nthe rules set by God. For the past\n1400 years such revivals were\ntaking place. Misinformation by\nin com pet ant orientalist s have caused ignorance about Islam in\nthe West. A new atmosphere now\nexists for US to find out about\nIslam.\nPOPULAR MYTHS Whenever Islam is mentioned by\nNon-Muslim Westerners, it usually\ninvolves narrow minded views on:\nIslam and polygamy; Islam and\npunishment (say lashing); Islam and\nrepression, etc. A good reference\nfor those who have not heard 'the\nother side' as explained by Muslims\nmay care to read 'Islam The Misunderstood Religion' or 'The\nSpread Of Islam' or any of the\nhuge literature that exists these\ndays, but is not 'good value' to be\nprinted in Western newspapers.\nBoth books can be see fi at book\ndisplays in the Islamic Week and\ncan be readily obtained.\nCORRECTIONS God is ONE, Islam (allegiance to\nGod) has been the religion of all\nthe prophets, including Moses and\nJesus and has been completed for\nus under Mohammad. Many schools of thought such as Ja'a far i, Maliki, etc, exist but NO SHI'ITE\u2014\nSUNNI categorisation is advocated\nexcept by the ignorant news\nreporters or by the enemies of\nIslam working under the banner\n'Divide To Rule'!!\nMISINFORMATION Well publicised and distributed news magazines are Newsweek,\nNow and Time. A few quotations will show how ignorant, harsh\nand cruel the treatment of anyone who upholds Islam is treated:\n'The holy city where Khomeini stole a revolution for Iran.'\n'Qom is the spiritual powerhouse of Iran's revolution. It thrives\non piety.'\n'Khomeini....has turned to a bloody tyrant, reviving a religious\nDark Age.'\n'The brutality is a popular element.'\n'The mass taste for the cruel has been fed most luridly by the\nrevolution's own judge Blood.'\n'A joyless Revolution.'\n'Laughter is a crime in the Islamic Republic'\n'A harsh, fundamentalist theocracy.'\n'The Mystic Who Lit The Fires Of Hatred.'\n'Unifying a nation behind such extremist positions is a remarkable achievement.'\n'Shi'ism allows for the presence of an Intermediary between God\nand man.'\n12\n\n"

    "content": "NUS CONFERENCE REPORT\nby Chris Webb\nOnce again, despite our non-member-ship of the National Union of Students, a member of this college union went to the\nrecent conference (in the guise of a party\nhelper).\nThe most important part of the conference, officially at least, are the\ndebates, which were as follows:\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSUBSCRIPTIONS: Remember it\nwas primarily over subs that ICU left NUS. What did we get for our\nmoney? In front of conference were\nfive proposals: ranging from the\nExecidea, a confused extension of\ncurrents subs policy, which would\nhave had half of NUS's money coming from forty institutions (ie\nuniversities and some of the larger\npolytechnics) at a rate increasing\ntwice as fast as most union's budgets. Had this policy been passed I feel many colleges would\nhave d is affiliated as they bagan to\nfeel the pinch. At the other extreme\nwas the rather simplistic Kings amendment, arguing for a more or\nless flat rate.\nIn the end all the amendments,\nand the main motion all failed. This\nleaves NUS with a big problem:\nsome sort of subs policy must be\nworked out at Easter, and ratified\nat Christmas or they may go bust.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nOVERSEAS STUDENTS: The Left Alliance/ Exec/ Tory/ Lib main\nmotion, a fairly moderate statement\nof intelligent and constructive opposition to the Government's ideas was passed, despite Trot and Maoist attempts to pass much more\nrabid and destructive amendments.\nThis motion, incidentally, must set\nsome sort of record: so many colleges submitted similar motions\nthat the final composite had 145\n\"Believes\" clauses.\nGRANTS AND CUTS: Proved more contentious \u2014 the Left Alliance/ Exec main motion, expressing opposition to the Tory economic policy, especially\" the cuts\" and reaffirming the desire to\nabolish the means test etc was passed eventually. The amendments\nproved interesting: the two Trot\ngroups proposed similar motions\nspelling out a \"recipe for Instant\nWhip Socialism\" according to the\nLiberal broadsheet. The Tory amendment supported the Govern ment's economic ideals, and the\nLiberals proposed their \"student\nwage\" policy, which I have not yet\nhad explained to me. The most\namusing was the Maoist shopping\nlist of demands for immediate nationalisation.\nHOUSING: Another massive composite of Exec/ Tory/ LA etc.\nThis placed the onus of finding\naccommodation for homeless students on local authorities, was\nagainst the selling of council houses, against flat agencies, against licences and in favour of\nmulti-signature mortgages.\nABORTION: Deja Vu. Very like\nthe ICU/ UL U Abortion/ Corrie debates, with a rousing summing up\nspeech from Anna Soubry (pro b ably the best of the conference).\nSUPPORT DEREK ROBINSON: This was an emergency motion( Robinson was a guest speaker,\nwho, contrary to some national press reports received a far from\nunanimous ovation). In the end, the\nLeft groups were all so busy voting\nout each other's views on union\nsolidarity that nothing was passed.\nTrevor Phillips then tried to tell the\npress that this didn't mean NUS didn't support Robinson, but was\ncorrectly ruled out of order.\nSo much for the motions, what of the\nrest: Firstly the Left Alliance (nee Broad Left) \u2014 the CP, NO LS and some Liberals\nis falling apart \u2014 many Liberals don't like\nit, and the CP had very few delegates.\nThe two Trot groups, SSA and SW SO, had a reasonable number of delegates,\nbut their speakers were unimpressive and\ntheir behaviour to the Mayor of Blackpool\nleft a very sour impression: his council let\nNUS use the Winter Gardens free, yet\nwhen he came to welcome conference the\nTrots congregated on the balcony to jeer\nat him. Eventually Phillips shut them up,\npointing out that even if they didn't like\nthe fact that he was a Conservative, he\nwas democratically elected by the people\nof Blackpool and we were their guests.\nThe Mayor, later that day, to his credit\nwas instrumental in securing the release\nfrom police custody of two Northern Irish delegates who had been detained on\nlanding in Liverpool.\n9&\nCITY AND GUILDS\nA new term starts and the Mighty Guilds Organization swings into action to\nprovide you with the best events in the\nCollege.\nThe first event is the Pyjama Rag on\nSaturday 19th January. For this Rag we\nall dress up in pyjamas or other night\nattire. Don't worry if you haven't got a pair, you are sure to be able to borrow\nsome from a friend, then we go out into\nLondon and extract money from people\nwho keep asking stupid questions like\n\" Why are you still wearing pyjamas at 11\no 'clock in Oxford Street?\"\nA bit of fun for all, so meet in the\nUnion Office at 9:30am suitably dressed.\nThe next event is the 29th Annual Engineers Dinner and Dance. This is\nthe highlight of the College year and is a, formal occasion. The event will be held in\nthe S her field Building on Friday2 January at 7:30 for 8:00pm. The evening\nconsists of a formal dinner followed by a cabaret and dancing to the early hours of\nSaturday. Hence the name Dinner and\nDance or D&D for short.\nTickets are on sale from the Union Office or from Dep Reps at the price of\n\u00a318.00 for a double ticket and \u00a310.00 for a single and are limited in number, so get\nyours early. The dress for the evening is\nblack tie. We have managed to negotiate\na deal with Moss Bros, which will give a25% reduction to you on Droduction of a union card for the hire of a dinner jacket\nat any of their London branches.\nDo not miss the chance to go to\nthis outstanding event.\nAlso we need an Assistant Honorary Secretary, so if you feel vo u would like to\ndo this job for the rest of the year (It\nentails minute taking at various meetings\nand gives a good insight into how the\nUnion is run.) see Jo or Sara in the\nOffice. The post will be elected at the\nnext Gen Com on 29th January.\nCheers Bryan.\n\n"

    "content": "Dear Editor\nI would like to bring to your\nattention that many things available\nin our Union Bookshop are sold at\na seemingly unreasonable price.\nFor example, A4 paper folder is\n72p at WH Smith, 60p at Barkers\n(both in High Street, Kensington)\nbut a similar one in our Union\nBookshop costs \u00a31.00. Computer\npaper folders were 50p in June\n1979 but when a subsequent batch\ncame in in August 1979 they were\n80p.I really doubt that it is possible\nat aD to have a near doubling in\nprice between two successive orders by the Bookshop.\nIam sure many students will\nhave noticed similar sorts of things.\nI would be glad if you can answer\nthe following doubts:\n(1) What is the legal' profit margin\nthat our bookshop is supposed to\nmake?\n(2) Has the Bookshop been making\nthe correct profit (I mean in\naccordance to the profit margin set\nby the Union) margin in the past\nyears?\n(3) Are the actual prices (such as\nthe items quoted above) in the\nBookshop based on the correct\nprofit margin set by the Union?

If not, is\nit not easy enough to put this into\npractise?\nThank you very much\nYours faithfully\nTC Tan Pet Eng, PG Sir\nAllow me to be the first in what I am sure will grow to a veritable\nchorus of congratulation. I refer to\nthe enlightened attitude of the\nEstates office towards the repair of\nthe College squash courts.\nIn these days of critical path\nanalysis and time and motion studies it is indeed a courageous\ndecision to specify for the execution of this task, such careful\nartisans.

The College collection amoun ted to seven carrier bags of clothes,\nsix bags and three large boxes of food\nand \u00a3 3 3 in money. The population of\nShelter varied from 250-450 over the\nChristmas week and they were all very\ngrateful for the food and clothing.\nMany of them are now back on the\nstreets, so if you want to meet some,\nwe have soup runs on Tuesday, Friday\nand (probably) Sunday nights \u2014 meet\nin Falmouth Hall Kitchen at 10:30pm. For anyone interested in any other\naspect of ICCA G's work (eg children,\nold people, prisoners etc etc), we have\na meeting every Monday lunchtime\n(12:30) in the ICCA G room (top floor\nof the Union Building \u2014 follow the\nsigns).\nMANAGEMENT SCIENCE BUSINESS\nGAME During the Christmas vacation, the\n1979 version of the above annual\nevent was held. It attracted a varied\nentry of twelve teams from London\nColleges such as QEC, Kings, UC and\nBrunei, including IC entries from\nChem Eng, Mech Eng, Civ Eng, CCD\nand Maths.\nIn his final summing up Professor\nSamuel Eilon explained some of the\ndifficulties of taking part in a game of\nsuch short duration and then\npresented a liquid prize to the winning\nteam (Kings College Ci vEng department).\nThere was absolutely no prize for\nthe second placed team \u2014 IC Maths\n(Team: Chris Callow, Ashok Patel,\nJitesh Gajjar, Barry Wareing and Mick\nBerry) who refused to reveal the\nsecret behind their success (a loss of\nonly \u00a342,926, putting them well ahead\nof IC Chem Eng in 3rd). The free refresh-ment s at least\nguaranteed that all teams showed a profit in material terms.\nMick Berry.\n4\n\n"

    "content": "THE STRUGGLE FOR POWER\nNo country should be without one \u2014\naccording to history anyway. History\nmight not repeat itself, but some of us\nsurely do. Russia's military involvement\nin Afghanistan comprises several struggles; not only is there the underlying\ntheme of Soviet global expansion, but\nalso America's problematic role in world\naffairs, the rise of Islam and the constant\nbattle for prestige. Russia's plans for\nexpansion are no news to anybody;\ntwenty years of Fidel Castro's regime in\nCuba have already passed, a prime\nexample of Soviet political investment.\nBut this time her intervention has\nsmashed hopes for an East-West detente\nand caused SALT2( Strategic Arms Limitations Talks) to be shelved. However, it may be that her hasty actions\nwhich caught America napping, were not\nsolely for reasons of aggrandizement.\nIslamic fer v our has been mounting in\nAfghanistan and consequently poses a threat to Russia's control over her\nsouthern-most territories which contain a large Moslem population. There are signs\nof an anxious Russia preparing for a long\ncampaign, to avoid the sort of humiliation\nthat America suffered through Iran.\nPrestige is all-important in world affairs,\nespecially for a nation that wants control\nof her satellite states.\nAmerica is heading right back the other\nway, her public pressing more and more\nfor policies of isolation. Carter has sent\nmilitary aid to Pakistan which borders\nAfghanistan, and may be making overtures to China, but his action against\nRussia has been a series of withdrawals,\nalbeit at his personal expense in\nAmerica's coming elections \u2014 no grain,\nno technology, no consulates-general and\npossibly no Olympics. America is getting\nout; it remains to be seen if she will\nadequately protect her interests in the\nMiddle East. Meanwhile back in Russia,\nsomeone in Politburo has itchy fingers.\nThe decision of Afghanistan must have\nbeen made with prior knowledge of both\nthe factors involved and the retaliation\nthat might be expected. The American\ngrown sanction will hit hard, with both\nlong and short term effects; heavy-handed\naction in crushing resistance in Afghanistan will only feed the fire of Islam and\ncombining this with fraternization between America and China makes for a nasty headache. What started out as a struggle for power, may end up as a lot of\ndomestic problems for all concerned.\nPakistan does not only border on Afghanistan; it also lies along the northern\nboundaries of India, where the political\nfortunes of the redoubtable Mrs Gandhi\nhave taken a sudden turn for the better.\nHaving swept all opposition before her in\nthe recent elections, she has been chosen\nby Indian populace to form a new\ngovernment, a shock decision in view of\nher totalitarian emergency rule three\nyears ago. The fundamental truth is that\nshe has been give\"na second chance,\nbecause of the worthlessness of the\nJanata government of the last few years\nand by her skilful and unscrupulous\nopportunism. Her careful electioneering\non. the economic failures of the last\ngovernment has proved successful, but an\nodour of nepotism lingers; Mrs Gandhi's son, Sanjay, has been returned as an MP with rumours of a post in his mother's government, which is perturbing, considering his past record, which\nincludes the unpleasant affair of the\ncompulsory sterilization programme. The\nfacile suggestion that India went to the\npolls to choose the lesser of two evils\nmight stand, but what follows now must\nsurely be a period of political probation.\nTechnically both mother and son are\nopen to indictment for various offences\nrelating to Mrs Gandhi's earlier rule; it\ncan only be hoped that such action will\nbe rendered untenable by a ministry with\nclear-headed and economically viable\npcS des j Lars Wernberg-Meller\nIn the election of 1977, Mrs Gandhi was\ndefeated and cast aside ignominiously by\na handful of old politicians who combined\nagainst her on a single platform. The election which was intended as the\npeople's stamp on autocracy thrust Mrs\nGandhi into oblivion. Yet only thirty\nmonths after this Mrs Gandhi has swept\nback to power with a two-thirds majority.\nWhatever else this is a tremendous\nachievement and a tribute to Mrs Gandhi's courage and belief.\nThe Janata party instead of using its\noffice to expose the sordid side of the\nemergency or develop a coherent conservative philosophy for modern India\nspent its time in perpetual bickering. The\nelectorate disillusioned by this rallied\nround Mrs Ghandi.\nMrs Gandhi fought the election on two\nmain issues: to provide economic stability\nand law and order. She promised discipline and a strong government.\nOne of the questions on people's minds\nis whether her son, Sanjay Ghandi, will be\ngiven a place in the cabinet or whether he\nwill simply be involved in party work.\nCOMMUNIST SOCIETY\nAFGHANISTAN The recent events in Afghanistan\nhave been tragic ones; both for the\nstruggle of the Afghan people for\nnational independence and for the future of world peace. Most members\nof Communist Society would second\nthe sentiments condemning the Soviet\naction, expressed in the Morning Star\nEditorial (31/12/79) \" Mr Karmal, the\nnew leader of the government in Kabul\nappears to favour a conciliatory approach toward the Islamic groups\nand that is said to have been the\nadvice which the Soviet Union has\ngiven all along. Such an approach\nmay very well be correct. What is\nwrong is the use of foreign military\nforce to bring in a new government to\nfollow such policies. For there are\nwider implications.\nThough noone denies that Mr Karmal asked for military assistance, it\nis by no means clear that he was\nentitled to do so as the established\npower in Afghanistan.\nThis is where the issue impinges on\nthe principle of non-interference in\nother countries. This principle is\ncentral to the struggle for world peace\nand disarmament so crucial at the\nSanjay was involved in the controversial\nfamily planning programme (being linked\nwith the un savoury forced sterilization)\nand was accused of corruption. Whether\nhe is in the Cabinet or not he will be\nnearer the centre than any holding\nministerial posts.\nWith Mrs Gandhi's two thirds majority\nshe can change the constitution, if she so\ndesires. In future there will probably be\nstates as Mrs Gandhi will continue the\ntrend to centralize the power. She might\nchange the system to one where there is\na presidential executor, as in France or\nthe United States. Opposition to this will\ncome from both inside and outside\nParliament. Mrs Gandhi has a large\nmajority in the Lower House. In the\n'Upper House, where the members are\nelected by the State assemblies. Things\ncould be very different as the State\nas em b lies are very much in tune with\nwhat happened during the emergency.\nOutside Parliament there will be opposition by the Trade Unionists, who are led\nby politicians and better organised than in\n1977, which could make things rough.\nMrs Gandhi will face considerable\nproblems once she is back in office.\nIndia is one of the top twelve industrial\nnations and produces everything from\ndrugs to digital watches. The home\nindustry is protected by keeping a tight\ncheck on imports. There is however little\nstability: the rising cost of crude oil and\nlabour unrest are major problems. India\nhas a power shortage even though there\nis plenty of coal because railway strikes\nhave prevented the coal being transported to where it is needed. Inflation is\nat 20%. India faces the worst drought in\nliving memory and has a huge deficit of\nmore than double that estimated.\nIt looks as if the next few years in India\nare going to be pretty turbulent.\nAftab Gujral\npresent time.\"\nAt the first Communist Society meeting of this term, Bert Ramelson\nwho visited Afghanistan a few months\nago will give an opening to discussion\non the background and consequences\nof recent events. Monday 14th January\nat 6:30pm in ICWA Lounge HAPPY NEW YEAR Now the heavy bit is over, it's time\nto wish you a Happy New Year and\nsuggest that you might have time to\nhave a quick spy into the I CW A Lounge on a Monday evening at\n6:30pm onwards to see how the moles\nare getting on.

FELIX, the Editor of FEU X and Union Officers\ncannot accept liability in respect of errors or\nomissions contained in articles herein.\nOn Friday 25th January you will find a questionnaire between the centre pages of\nFELIX. This is a rare opportunity for FELIX,\nICU and the College to find out valuable\ninformation which will perhaps influence major\ndecisions taken in the 80s. You have the opportunity to come up with\nsuggestions as to what questions or facts\nshould be gathered in the questionnaire. Please\nwrite or visit the FELIX Office to discuss your\nideas.\nI originally decided to have a ten percent\nsample questionnaire just on the content of\nFELIX, but the idea has snowballed into a full\n4,000 run A4 questionnaire.\nSome of the areas that will be covered are:\nThe Media: Do you read FELIX? If so, what\nchanges would you like to see in the paper?\nHow much effect does all the work put in by\nmembers of IC Radio and STOIC have on\nCollege life?\n- Accommodation: By now you are settled in\nyour digs, hall or house. Are you happy there?\nWhat improvement would you like to see\nimplemented?\nEntertainment: Do you study every night? If\nnot, does ICU deliver the goods or do you\nlook outside College for entertainment?\nFood: When do you eat? College refectories\nor Kentucky Fried Chicken?\nBars: A topical question. Do you care what\nhappens to College bars?\nEntertainment at Imperial is a ICU subject\nthat urgently needs to be discussed. The ICU sabbaticals have been giving thought to the\nrunning of the Union. We are in a good\nposition to make some decisions but in the\narea of entertainment the solution is not so\nstraight forward. To quote Chris, \"I haven't managed to come up with much yet.\" In this\nEditorial I hope to stimulate discussion in the\nsame way that I covered the subject of Imperial\nCollege Women's Association (ICWA) in my\nlast Editorial.\nAt first I thought that one solution may be to\ncentral is e the organising of entertainment by\ncreating a post in the Union \u2014 say Social\nSecretary. This would work if we could\nannually find a dynamic personality to take on\nthe job. He would almost have to* be a sabbatical and in the present climate there isn't any extra cash flowing around for a fifth one!\nThe job descriptions of one of the present\nsabbaticals could be changed to incorporate\nthat of a Social Secretary. However, judging by\nthe look of exhaustion on most of the Exec's faces last term, they have enough to do\nalready. (As a quick interruption, I would like\nto define what I mean by the term ICU Exec.\nIn my motion 'Public Image', I referred to the\nExec and I mean the ICU President, DP and\nHon Sec plus the three Vice Presidents\n(Presidents of Guilds, Mines and RCS j. The Social Secretary, as a non-sabbatical\nwould need an active team working with him.\nAt Imperial we are obsessed with committees\nand I don't wish to see another created. Most\nof the major decisions seem to be taken over\ncoffee in the Bot/Zoo Common Room rather\nthan during a committee meeting. (Have you\nseen the newly decorated Bot/Zoo yet?)\nHaving a team working with him the Soc Sec\nwould be able to plan a week's entertainment.\nIt is crazy having a giant gig in the Great Hall\nand still expecting Folk club to have a large\naudience on the same night! Each evening\nshould be set aside to one major event or\nseveral minor ones. There are a limited\nnumber of students who are inspired to join in\nwith student entertainment at IC and so they s hould either be encouraged to go to one big\nevent or to spread themselves over more\nspecialised activities catering for smaller\nnumbers.\nPerhaps you are beginning to realise how\nimportant the questionnaire (outlined above) is\nin our attempts to help you have a good time\nat Imperial. If we know how much time\nstudents allocate to relaxing, and what things\nyou like to do then, there is a better chance of\ngiving you what you want.\nThe ratio of men to women at Imperial has\nbeen a challenging problem for nearly a century. Until we find the time to encourage\ngirls from outside College to come to IC events\nthen we are going to be stuck with a9:1 ration.\nWe can learn from organisers of Tizard Hall\ndiscos; they manage to fill the J CR with nurses\nand students from female colleges. Dancing\nClub has many girl members from outside IC.\nTen years ago there were hardly any women at\nIC and so girls had to be encouraged to visit\nus, but now we have a large enough number in\nthe College to give an illusion that we are a 'mixed' social environment.\nBefore we all rush off to invite girls to IC\nevents we must make sure that they have a good time while they are here, so that they'll\ncome back for more entertainment.\nLondon is dead if you're on your own;\ndiscos, theatre, films and bars have lost the\nsocial atmosphere that once made them ideal\nplaces to meet new friends. New clubs for\nsingles are springing up everywhere but they\ncater for people in their mid-twenties.\nUniversities can contribute to improving not\nonly student life in London but also the social\nlife of people in their early twenties who live\nand work in London. There are dozens of\nsecretarial colleges in London, that haven't any\nsocial events. Students at Imperial who live in\nthe halls of residence are not keen on travelling\nto areas of entertainment, but if you're on you\nown, living in digs, then travelling to an event is\na minor hassle.\nAn event must not only entertain but also\ngive people a chance to break the ice. I believe\nthat even at Imperial there are still many shy\nstudents who have not fully broken through\nthe barriers that hold them back from making\nnew friends. We should have more ice-breaker\nevents where second and third years make an\neffort to introduce fresher s to each other.\nFreshers' dinners, dinner in hall etc all help but\nthere aren't enough events where students can\nmake new friends.\nAt a party or disco it is not easy to form a lasting relationship. If you're watching a film in\na cinema or in Mech Eng 220 there is little\nchance to talk, except in the aue ue or while\ntraveling to the cinema. Rag activities are good\nbecause there is an aim to the event as well as\ngiving students the chance to meet each other.\nHowever, of the 4,000 plus students at IC the\nones who get involved with Rag are usually the\nmore outgoing students.\nIf we invite girls from outside College to an\nevent then it will be an evening activity which\nunless it's held in the summer will be indoors.\nSeveral girls from outside get involved in the\nmedia at IC: presenting programmes for\nSTOIC, being aDJ for IC Radio or by taking\nphotos for FEI.IX. This is an ideal way for\nlasting links to be created. However, most girls\nvisit us on re and it's their 'first impressions'\nthat guide their choice to return. Just a disco\nis not enough to break the ice. A planned\nevening's entertainment where the visitors get\ninvolved in games or events that encourage the\ninitial barriers of shyness to be broken, coupled with ad isro for part of the time would\nbe better. Several recognised hosts could go\nround introducing the visitors to students at\nIC.\nColin Palmer\n(FELIX Editor)\n\n"

I hope that the anguish\nafter the orphaned goslings Christmas\nGander created isn't worrying you too\nmuch.\nContrary to common belief this term is not <\ngoing to be void, there's lots to look\nforward too, vis.\nWELFARE DAY\nOn Wednesday 13th February \u2014 In which\nthe finer points will be highlighted with\nstalls and things in the J CR, probably\naccompanied by an all day bar, and some\nnovelty acts, like sex films!\nOVERSEAS STUDENTS FAIR\nA week later \u2014 This is going to be\norganised by OS C and again will be in the\nJ CR. Indian food can be washed down by\nGreek Ouzo or French Wine. An excellent\nopportunity to taste the custom as well as the\nfoods of the societies in OS C. Also of course the elections will soon be\nupon us. That's when I become a has-been\nbefore I have been! All I would like to say\nis that anyone considering a post should\nnot hesitate to see myself or other relevant\npersons to get a full job description, and\ncan rely on confidentiality from me. To underline the point made to me by one or\ntwo friends that I spend too much time in\nthe Union Bar, I would like to agree and\nsuggest that all candidates for posts should be teetotal, or at least do their\ndrinking where no one else can see them!\n(Which just about covers my New Year's Resolution).\nMichael Arthur' s brief has somewhat changed of late, his new role taking him\nout of the Centre more. To cover for this\nand further expand the scope of the\ncentre a part-time assistant, Susan Telling,\nhas been appointed over the holidays. I wish her a happy stay here.\nAlso over the holidays I prepared a paper\non cutting and streamlining the oh-so\nconfusing ICU committee structure. I hope that when it finally sees the light of\nday that it stimulates action as well as\ndiscussion and hysteria.\nESTIMATES\nThese must be prepared as soon as pos s, so if your major sub-committee hasn't contacted you about them it's because\nyou didn't pick up the mail or the 'infernal'\nmail didn't deliver it. Get cracking.\nSo I can go back to putting my new velvet\njacket on and taking it off again and you\ncan go back to Quantum Mechanics safe\nin the knowledge that the quality of the\nFOX articles have not improved over the\nChristmas break.\nToodle pip\nCHRIS JUST ASEC Welcome back and I hope you had a marvellous Christmas and New Year. This week'sHon Sec article is somewhat\nlong' but full of dates and information.\nUGMs\nThere are four meetings this term (one\nbeing largely devoted to the sabbatical\nelections). Please make a note of the\ndates. They are: Tuesday 22nd January,\nTuesday5 th February, Thursday6 th March( Hustings) and Thursday13 th March( Results and Officers' Elections).\nAll the meetings are held at 1:00pm in the\nGreat Hall. After the article is an account\nof how the meetings are conducted which\nI do urge you strongly to read. It would\nbe good to see new faces turning up\n(relative to other Universities we already\nhave a good and representative attendance) and more people handing in\nmotions. This is why I 've put up those\nposters around the campus. The deadline for motions, which have to be\nsubmitted to me, is seven days prior to aUG M. LIBRARY\nIf you didn't know, i he Haldane Library (just\nby the entrance to \u2022 ne Great Hall) stocks an\nexcellent select ic or books mainly fiction\nand non-scientifi i:. records, classical and an\nexcellent selection of pop and jazz. The point is that two students buy all the non-classical records and fiction and what they\ngo on are the actual suggestions put in to the\nlibrary on their suggestion cards. So if you\nwant to borrow a particular book/ record and it's not in there, suggest it and there's a very good chance it will be bought. So if you\ndon't like the selection \u2014 change it!\nPWP MEMBER Foiiowing the resignation of Colin Palmer as\naP WP ordinary member, the papers went\nup for this post on Tuesday and shall come\ndown on Thursday 17th January (voting to\nbe at the U GM on 22nd January). If you\nwish sit on this working party committee\nand nen ce on Council find out what it entails\nfirst and t nen you'll need a proposer and ten\nsecond ers. Paoers are situated in the Lower Lounge.\nNUS\nCOMMITTEES An important point is that all Union Committees are open. As one person\nwho sits on all these it seems that there\nis one sitting all the time. If you wish to\nattend one you are perfectly able to. As they are not often adv eris ed, times etc\ncan be obtained from me.\nThe most important committee is\nCouncil which has vested in it the\n\"management of the Union\". It is to\nCouncil that all officers must report and\nhence there is a check on the work of the\nsubcommittees. Dates of this terms Councils are: Monday28 th January in\nS CR, Monday25 th February in S CR and\nMonday17 th March in Siiwood Field\nStation. They are all held at 6:00pm. UNION OFFICE\nThe effective centre of all College life is the\nUnion Office. In case you aren't sure where\nthat is, I 'll tell you: As you enter the Beit\nQuadrangle, through the archway, then\nopposite you across the Quad is the heaven\non earth of the Union Building containing all\nsorts of wonder (Yes! even Space Invaders).\nThe Union Office is via the Entrance at the\nright hand of the building and is found on the\nfirst floor.\nHere you can book a room, book a van, grab\ndetails of clubs and societies, book for a hall\ndinner etc. Now we come to the\ninhabitants....God created Adam and Eve,\nbut more importantly the three Union Office permanent staff and the three full-time Student Officers: Chris Fox, Malcolm Brain and myself, Roger Stotesbury. We share the responsibility for all the areas of\nthe Union's work, so please do not hesitate\nto come and chat to us.\nLast term I had many quer ries as to why\nImperial College Union is not in NUS. To put the matter into perspective I include\nhere a section from FELIX dated 17th November 1978 giving the results of a campus-wide referendum called for by aUG M: In an enormous poll last\nFrid \u2022 \u2022moe rial college\nSru- .'-.ton decided not to\nre aft uic i: to the National\nUnion atta dents. i he re^ren dum was held as\na college : :i a e ballot with ballot\nboxes in each department and\none ser,; to Suwood. Over two\nt nous and five hundred people\nvoted: the largest turnout for\nsome considerable time, made\neven more impressive by the\nfact that the ballot on lv took\nplace on one day. The final\nfigures were:\n140*: against re-affiliation,\n1058 m rav our of affiliating,\nSt- cio stent ions and\n2 soo ii r pao ers. It became clear4 before the\nend of the count that the\nmajority a e as ion was against\naffiliation: the two boxes on the\nEnvironment Technology and\nGeo/oc v field trips had no\neffect on t ne result.\nThus the decision not to re affiliate was\ntaken last academic year, two years after we\nv ore a to pull out. with a massive poll of over\n2,500 members.\nDU REX In case you ever have call to purchase a sheath, et me tell you there is aDur ex machine in the mens' toilets in the Union Buiiding.
