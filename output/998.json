Unknowingly she\nsees someone leaving the building but, because\nof her rect ro active vision, she is unable to tell\nwho it was. When Emma's neighbour is found\ndead in her flat, Detective John Hallstrom\n(Aidan Quinn) begins to realise that Emma is the\nkey to finding the killer.\nAfter picking out a policeman in a line up,\nJohn still believes that Emma did see the\nmurderer despite his sceptical colleagues. From\nthen it is a race to stop the murderer from\nStarring: Hugh Grant, Andie MacDowell\nDirector: Mike Newell\nYou've probably heard of this English film\nbecause it's been a surprise hit in the United\nStates. Four Weddings And A Funeral was made\non a shoe-string budget of \u00a33.75 million and has\nalready made well over $30 million across the\npond. Its success in America is as much\nattributable to a shrewd marketing strategy as a sensational script.\nThe story follows the exploits of a group of\nfriends as they attend four weddings and one\nfuneral. One of the group, Charles (Hugh Grant)\nis apparently not suited for marriage. He is\ncontinually late for every engagement and has\nnever committed himself to a long-term\nrelationship.\nHowever, at the first wedding, Charles meets\nCarrie (Andie MacDowell), an American girl\nwho captivates him. A night of passion is not\nenough to keep them together and they don't see\neach other again until the next wedding two\nstriking again as Emma becomes the next\npossible victim.\nThe filmmakers used computer graphics and\nanimation to create Emma's actual sight. The\nhallucinations and the out of focus effects give\nthe viewer a greater understanding of what\nEmma is having to cope with. All she sees are\nshapes with no meaning and then, when her\nmind finally registers the images, they appear to\nher out of the blue, adding to the confusion. New\nimages flood her mind that have no meaning, for\nmonths later. Again, they sleep together despite\nCarrie having just introduced her new fiance.\nThe third wedding is Carrie's, the fourth is\nCharles' and the funeral is for a friend of Charles.\nAndie MacDowell's performance is put to\nshame amidst those of all the British actors and\nactresses but I suppose she had to be there if the\nfilm was to get previewed in the States. Hugh\nGrant plays Charles admirably with the innocent\ncharm demanded by the part. Four Weddings\noozes with stereotypical Britishness. Rowan\nAtkinson's appearances as a vicar are brief but\nmemorable. The scenes range from central\nLondon to English country villages to Scottish\nhighlands.\nFour Weddings is a hoot but with screenplay\nby Richard Curtis it was a dead cert. The fac adic situations of official functions provide a rich\nseam of comic circumstance.\nIf I had a reservation it would be the\nromance. The mush between Charles and Carrie\nis taken a little too seriously considering the\nabsurd nature of their relationship.\nwhat is beauty to someone who has previously\nnever seen anything before?\nThe film centres on Emma and John's passionate relationship as well as the effects of\nher having sight rather than on the murderer.\nThis is a shame since the murderer's motive is\none of the more complex ideas of the film and\ncould have been explored more deeply.\nMagpie\nOpens at the Odeon West End today. Tube:\nLeicester Square. Ticketsfrom \u00a37.\nAndie MacDowell and Hugh Grant take part\nin a wet T shirt competition\nWell worth even the extortionate central\nLondon prices for cinema tickets.\nSphinx\nOpens today.

    "content": "News\nNatWest Manager\nHeads East\nAttack On Student\nBY SIMON SHAW\nThe Manager of NatWest Bank's Imperial College Branch, Mr George Jamieson, leaves today after\nmore than ten years at the College.\nMr Jamieson has built up a formidable reputation among students.\nSince the news of his departure\nbecame known, he has been awarded\ncolours (recognition for an outstanding contribution) by all three\nof IC's South Kensington\nConstituent College Unions.\nMr Jamieson, who has been with\nNatWest for 25 years, will be moving to their Regional Office at\nCurzon Street. When asked if he\nwas excited at the prospect of m ov ing, he said that he would be but for\nthe fact that he would miss Imperial\nfor which he has a \"tremendous\naffection\". \"I will always remember\nImperial,\" he said.\nThe outgoing manager feels very\nstrongly about the low level of\nGovernment student grants. He confesses to having bent the rules in the\npast in order to accommodate stu-dents' financial needs and admits to\nbeing \"unorthodox\" in his approach\nto student banking over the years\nand has even been known to give a struggling student money from his\nown pocket for them to \"buy a Burger King\". \"You have to take a long-term view with students,\" he\nsaid. The bank expects to make a profit out of them ten years into the\nfuture when they are successful in\nbusiness or industry.\nSince Mr Jamieson came to\nImperial, NatWest have gradually\nincreased their share of Freshers'\naccounts. Last year, 82 per cent of\nImperial fresher s banked with\nNatWest - the highest on record.\nMr Jamieson's successor will be\nMr Hari Nair who comes from\nNatWest's Branch at Onslow\nGardens. One project Mr Nair\ninherits is the possible installation\nof a second automated cash-point\ncloser to Southside.\nA female student was attacked last\nFriday night whilst walking from\nSouthside towards Brompton Road.\nThe attack occurred at 1.30am in\nthe alleyway near the Holy Trinity\nChurch on Brompton Road. She\nwas walking with a male friend at\nthe time. The students managed to\nfight off the attacker and they were\nnot badly hurt. Both students were\nvery shaken by the incident.\nThe attacker was white, badly\nspoken, about 6'4\" tall and with a mop of brown hair. He was accompanied by another white male who\nheld back during the attack.\nIf you see anyone fitting these\ndescriptions, please contact College\nSecurity (ext. 3392) or the Police\nimmediately. This is the first assault\nof this type to have taken place in\nthe district in many years.\nPimlico Visit USA\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nFive Imperial College students represented the Pimlico Connection at\na Campus Outreach Opportunity\nLeague conference in Boston USA over the Easter vacation. This\nWednesday they gave a presentation to some of their sponsors,\nincluding the Rector, Pro-Rector\nand British Petroleum.\nThe Pimlico Connection Scheme\nputs student tutors in schools to\nencourage a better understanding\nabout higher education and science.\nSimilar schemes to the Pimlico\nConnection operate in the States\nand the Imperial College students\ngained new ideas and were able to\npromote their scheme to others at\nthe conference.\nThe students, Ian Gregory,\nRichard Boardman, Kelda Bratley,\nVicky Owen and Joey Islam were\ngiven a great reception by the\nAmerican students.\n\u2022 FRESH HAIR SALON \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022\nthe best student offer in london!

    "content": "12 Reviews\nOde To Compassion From\nMusic's Grand Old Man\nSir Michael Tippett is the Grand Old Man of\nBritish music. His larger-than-life image is built\non his status as one of the world's greatest living\ncomposers, as well as rumours of eccentricities\nsuch as cars abandoned in high street traffic jams\nand tattered sneakers worn beneath ceremonial\nrobes at honorary degree ceremonies. I saw him\nonce a few years ago in the foyer at the Royal\nOpera House; nattily bow-tied, frail, leaning on\nthe arm of a companion, he was twinkling\ncheerfully at a fan who had stopped for a few\nwords.\nHe is 90 next year and planned celebrations\ninclude a new production of the Trojan\nmasterpiece King Priam. Among the record\ncompanies Chandos, typically adventurous, have\nbegun a cycle of the four symphonies with\nRichard Hickox and the Bournemouth\nSymphony Orchestra. The second release is the\nhour-long Third Symphony of 1972, coupled\nwith the brief Praeludium for brass and\npercussion.\nIn the manner of Beethoven's Ninth\nSymphony, which it quotes, Tippett's ambi tuo us Third contains a vocal finale. The texts are the\ncomposer's own and are intended as a reflection\non the Beethoven/Schiller Ode to Joy. If\nuniversal brotherhood seems, in the light of the\nhorrors of this century, to be beyond us, then\ndifferences must be overcome and problems\nresolved, through mercy and compassion. This\ncould be trite or profound; the quality of\nTippett's invention ensures it is\nthe latter.\nThe Chandos release faces\nstiff competition from Sir Colin\nDavis and the London\nSymphony Orchestra, whose\naccount of the Third comes as\npart of a three-disc, mid-price\nDecca set of the symphonies.\nDavis is more aggressive in the\ntumult o us first movement and\nthe energetic brass interjections\nhave a wilder glee. But Hickox\nis suppler in the hurtling string\nlines, high violins have a sweeter bloom and the\nBournemouth winds are surer\nand crisper of ensemble than\ntheir London counterparts. Rich\nthough they sound, however,\nHickox's brass are blown away\nby the stunning virtuosity of\nLSO horn and trumpets, which\ngives Davis the edge in\npunching home the climactic\nfanfares at 7'00\" on track one of the Decca.\nOf the soprano soloists in Part II, Faye\nRobinson for Hickox is brighter, Heather Harper\non Decca warmer and more secure. In the crucial\nlast section, Hickox is the more convincing,\nbetter than Davis at drawing together the threads\nof the symphony's second half: Beethoven,\nRichard Hickox conducts the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra\nin a new recording of Tippett's Third Symphony\nMiles Davis-inspired flu gel horn blues and\nwistful murmuring s recalled from the slow\nmovement of Part I. Try the inspired final\nminutes from 6 ' 1 5 \" on track eight of the\nChandos: this is visionary music and Hickox is\nmore likely to convince you of the fact.\nPatrick Wood\nWarm Welcome For ENO's Sunny New Cost Fan Tutte\n\u2022 m Cost nook: Richard Van Allan as Don Alfonso\nEnglish National Opera's new production of\nMozart's Cost Fan Tutte is a sunny success. It\ndeftly conveys the humour and irony in this\nslightly wicked trial of female fidelity. Don\nAlfonso, a cynical (pragmatic?) old philosopher\nidly professes that the lovers of his two young\nfriends are, like all women, wantonly fickle.\nOutraged, our Romeos agree to put their darlings\nto the test in an increasingly insane intrigue to\nwoo them in disguise (and what disguises!).\nAccording to Mozart and librettist Da Ponte,\nthe women ultimately melt under these\ncompulsions, only to be humiliated by the final\nrevelation. Despite the multiple betrayals, both\npairs of lovers conform to the convention of\nmarriage with their original partners, wiser and\nstripped of any lingering innocence.\nA dubious moral is cunningly subverted in\nthis refreshingly lucid presentation. Nicolette\nMolnar, making her directorial debut with the\ncompany, ensures it is the women who have the\nlast laugh in a wonderfully inventive coup de\ntheatre that it would be a crime to reveal.\nThe cast of young singers is uniformly\nstrong, effortlessly combining the demands of\ndirector and composer. Over all is cast the sage\ninfluence of Richard Van Allan's sovereign\nAlfonso.\nA delicious evening's entertainment and\nwarmly recommended.\nRalph\nIn rep at the Coliseum, St Martin's Lane,\nWC2N. 071 836 3161.

    "content": "10 Reviews\nA new concept in reviewing this week from my\nfevered mind, a smorgasbord of cluttered\nalbums. Heading off first with Dig's album Dig\n(see photo below).\nYou don't need to be au\nfait with the current music\nscene to know that there's a veritable glut of indie-styled metal bands\nscampering out of the\nwoodwork and into the\nclutches of the major\nrecord label executives\nand, by now, the cry of\n\"yes, but this band have a special quality about them\"\nis becoming ac liche beyond-clich e in the\npopular music press.\nUnfortunately this\nparticular clich e does not\napply to Dig, although\nmany others certainly do. I mean, let's face it, do we really need more songs\nwith that infamous semi-threatening bass line\nand barrage of squealing, wah-wah guitars,\nwhile someone hollers \"I 'll stay high\" over the\ntop? Every now and again they tease us with\nsome inspirational dashes, such as the surf-guitar sound in 'Ride the Wave'. Nevertheless,\nat the end of the day, like their record label\nRadioactive, too much exposure to this could\nseriously damage your health. (5) Vik\nThe progression of snow queens gets one\nlonger. Stina Nordenstam starts her album,\nAnd She Closed Her Eyes, with geographical\nnonsense (see photo right). 'When Debbie's Back From Texas' may be more than a mere air\nfare away from her native Norway, but it marks\nthe beginning of a remarkable journey. Words\nso shy that they sound\nhardly formed float and\nquickly conquer. \"I could\nthink of a few things to\nbelieve in, but I don't know\nabout love,\" she sings with\nall the uneasy certainty of\nthe spurned. You may have\nto check what they actually\nare but the music is as\ncompelling as glacial\nmomentum. The whole\nthing is shot through with\nthe kind of beautiful\nabsurdity which means so\nmuch and is so precious.\n\"Not quite on Main Street\"\nperhaps, but an exile only\nto the coldest corner of a bleak heart. (8) Tintin\n\"Time and Pills - let's waste a year,\" says\nSwell's David Freel on 'Kinda Stoned' from\ntheir album 41. Maybe that is why it's taken me\nso long to review it. A garage band without an\nengine, Swell do everything gradually. The first\nminute of the first track proper is a long straight\nstrum. The first track un proper, 'In The Door,\nUp The Stair' is exactly that. Someone opening\na door and stepping up some creaky wooden\n\u00ab stairs, maybe the same\nstairs which are on the\nfront cover. Definitely so.\nWhat is slowly done is\nproperly done.\nThe penultimate track is\n'Down The Stairs, Out The\nDoor'. In between are ten\ncrafted pieces, taut with\nwarm acoustic riffs and\nslow electric guitars. A phone rings, the band talk\nto each other. Like I said,\nthere is no engine here. It\nis a stationary glide around\nthe block. When you're\nalready deeply in love with\nthe place you're at, what's the point of moving on. (8)\nTintin\nDog Eat Dog are another Noo Yawk\nhardcore/rap/metal hybrid, so what's new? Well,\na horn section for a start. Lacking Biohazard's ferocity or Life Of Agony's sheer genius, they,\nhave carved out their own niche by mixing up an\nalphabet soup of influences to produce All Boro\nKings, their first album. Fuelled more by beer\nthan righteous anger this breathes fresh air into\nthe often oppressively PC rapcore scene. Dog\nEat Dog's social commentary is tempered by the\nneed to have a good time. Musically fat,\nfriendly, AC/DC riffs mix with hip-hop rhythms\nand the saxophones which set them apart from\nthe crowd. Every track is a rousing anthem to\nshout along or pogo to. The sparse production\ncaptures the loosely jointed joie de viv re of the\nlive show. (7) Freddy C Brothers and sisters!\nWilly 'all welcome the\nheart and soul of New\nOrleans: Aaron, Charles,\nCyril and Art, the mighty,\nmighty Neville BrothersLive On Planer Earth. Ow\nright! Funk, funk, soul,\nrock, reggae, jazz, gospel,\nsoul, funk, funk, soul. It's all here, people. Yes, sir.\nY 'all be gro ov in' now, ya\nhear? Peace! One more\nexclamation mark! Yeah!\nThere's 'Sister Rosie' for\nthe Brother's muth a, his\nqueeen, his daughter and\nstrong wim min every-where! Nobody rides on the\nback o' the bus, no more. Then there's 'Brother\nJake', 'Voodoo' and 'Yellow Moon'. Y 'all be\nfight in' back them tears when yo' hear Brother\nAaron's virtuoso rendition of 'Amazing Grace'.\nAmen. One tapped one's foot a lot. Like James\nBrown without shotguns. Funky but harmless. (7)\nSphinx\nHelium - Private Prude: There\nare some serious twisted\nmoments at the end of the\nrainbow owned by Helium.\nThis mini album has tracks like\n'Baby Vampire Made Me' and\nits companion 'Wanna Be A Vampire Too,\nBaby' - a sort of grown up gritty slap in the face\nto Winona and Annie Lennox's Dracula\nweakness. Helium get you involved in such\nweirdness as you would not believe. Muses to\ntheir madness, Mary Timony c roans away,\naffectionately high pitched, whilst the bass/\ndrumming lads torture away the background.\nThe perfect beast they build is the product of\nthree eight-mile-high Bostonians as they trawl\nthrough some pseudo Taoist concepts. This is\nthe Dalai Lama with a stratocaster and a bottle\nof Jack Daniels. Cool in an art school way. Tintin\nIvy - Get Enough: An ex-Melody Maker\nsingle of the week and for once we go along too.\nThis is a beautiful two and a half minutes of easy\npop forever stranded on 7\" of white plastic. Get\nEnough is vacant enough to fill a head and with\nthe edge to give a bloodied kiss. The purest\nrecord I have heard for a long time. Tintin\nFrank Black - Headache: While his first solo\nalbum saw the former Pixies' frontman\ndistancing himself from their unique sound, this\ndoes nothing but recall it. He seems far more at\nhome now and, despite the title, the tunes are for\nmore celebratory than on his recent work. Ridley\nPortastatic - Naked Pilseners: Simplicity is\nall. Portastatic is the work of one man,\nSuperchunk's Mac, in his bedroom with no more\nthan a guitar or two and some drums and it's beautiful. The guitar strings have space to chime\nand the melody finds room to weave its way into\nyour head, until all of a sudden it's over.\nUnusual, interesting, varied and excellent. Guy\nGalliano - Long Time Gone: Definitely more\nClare Short than Prince Charles this one. The\nguitarist takes more than a cursory nod towards\n'Crosstown Traffic', but we can allow him that\none. Brilliant groove. Remember those lazy\nsummer Sundays down at Dingwalls.\n^\n1 Vanilla Trainwreck - Kiss Me:\nStarting on the chaotic escalator\nof sound does little to make this\naccessible. Things settle down as\nthe grooves turn but this is for all\nthose puritans who think\nPavement have sold out. Tintin\nStabbing Westward - Control: Stabbing\nWestward? Heading upwards by the sound of this.\nThey've toured with Front 242 and Therapy? and\nfuse the best elements of both, inventive keyboard\nloops and a menacing bassline, into an engaging\npiece of semi-industrial, techno-metal. Vik\nInch - Linger. Heavy guitars clashing with some\nneat bifurcations of direction (that B. Eng didn't go\nto waste) don't do enough to roll Beethoven for this\none. Too much neo-California grunge clogs his\nears. As for him being deaf, forget it: Tintin\nI'm on the corner like a fallen Marishino cherry\n\n"

    "content": "Science 5\nWhy did it take so long? Finding\na gene with an unknown function\namongst a background of 100,000\nother genes is no mean feat. The\ngene (now that we know) is 210,000\nbases long (a base is a letter in the\ngenetic code A,C,T or G) and the\nhuman genome is 3,000,000,000\nbases long.\nConsidering that the gene could\nreside in either strand of the double\nhelix DNA, it would be concealed\nsomewhere within six thousand\nmillion bits of information. It would\ntake up only 0.0035% of the human\ngenome. It would be like looking for\nan unknown word that spans 52\npages in 800 volumes of The\nComplete Works of Shakespeare\nand the word could just as well be\nbackwards.\nBut even that analogy is\ninaccurate for, whilst we have The\nComplete Works of Shakespeare in\nprint, we do not have a base\nsequence of the human genome.\nSo how was it done? The location\nof the gene was homed into using a technique called linkage analysis.\nThis powerful tool came about as\ngeneticists like Thomas Hunt\nMorgan discovered that gene-pairs\ndeviate from Mendel's Second Law\nof Inheritance. Why is it that we\nnever see people with jet-black hair\nsporting blue eyes? A rather naive\nconclusion would be that the genes\nfor brown eyes are linked to black\nhair. (Naive because we have not\nperformed a statistical analysis on\nthe human population to ascertain\nthis casual observation.) So, if every\nsufferer of HD has black hair, we can\nconclude that the HD gene was\nlinked to the genes for hair colour.\nAnd if we knew on which of the 22\npairs plus two chromosomes the\ngenes for hair-colour resides, our\nsearch would be narrowed down to\nabout 35 volumes of the bard's works.\nThat is the concept of linkage in\nrather crude terms. In fact, the HD gene was first found to be linked not\nto some visible trait, but to a certain\nvariant (a poly mop his m) of a segment of DNA( known as G8) on\nchromosome 4. This was done using\nthe then freshly emergent tools of\nmolecular biology (and a rather large\nslab of luck); and it took more than\nthree years of sifting through blood\nsamples of Macaraibo Venezuelans.\nG8 can be thought of as a marker -much like black hair - and this result\nwas first published in 'Nature' in\nNovember 1983.\nIt was to take another ten years\nand a score of scientists working in\nseveral countries, using G8 as a springboard, to pin-point the gene.\nNow we know where the gene is and\nwhat it looks like, but we still do not\nknow what function it codes for.\nWhat does this breakthrough\nmean? It means that if you were that\nperson in the beginning of the article,\nwe could tell you if you carried that\ntime-bomb. Perhaps more\nimportantly, if you were a carrier,\nand was with child, we could tell you\nif your foetus has inherited the\ndisease gene.\nThe work, really, has only begun.\nFor in sequencing the gene, we now\nhave a handle with which to study\nwhat it actually does. This may lead\nto some medical therapy (gene\ntherapy?) in the future when we may\nbe able to cut the fuses off the\nHuntington's Disease gene before\nthe clinical symptoms rear their ugly\nheads. Or we may be able to replace\nthe disease gene with a normal one in\nthe fertilised embryo. In addition,\nlike our studies on cancer, dissecting\nthe disease process would\nundoubtedly lead to our\nunderstanding of some very basic\nbiology, like the ageing process.\nPerhaps in The Complete Works\nof Shakespeare the gene would start\nas: \"The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together...\" and when we have\ndiscovered how it originate, all's well will end well!\n/\n/ft.:/''.\nFurther reading:\nGenome: The Story of our Astonishing Attempt to Map all the\nGenes in the Human Body.

As for the most hijacked\ncharacters, run away and play with Jesus Christ,\nCharles Darwin and Friedrich Nietzsche.\nIt is Darwin's last night on earth, he has a dream, he has been taking acid. Well, the last point\nisn't strictly true but, considering what occurs,\nhe's been eating more than cheese before bed.\nNietzsche arrives, syphilitic and dribbling\nmad, in a wheelbarrow. His sister and her\nhusband are in tow with 150 racially pure\nGermans. All off for a new Aryan Utopia in\nParaguay. Except that they have all fallen into a village pond in Kent.\nRoll up, roll up. Next Jesus arrives, seemingly fresh from a leg of the Tour de France,\ncycle and all. As he says in his broad Irish\naccent, when you have all of human existence to\nchoose from, why come back with sandals and a beard? He popped in to comfort Emma Darwin\non her soon to be realised bereavement. Are you\ngetting the idea? All we now require is escort\ngirl Mary Magdalene, lowered in by helicopter\nto fulfil Nietzsche's carnal cravings. The boat is\nfull, let the play really commence.\nIf the first half is satisfying, the second is\nabsolute tech nicol our, whizz-bang, comic\ntheatre. The compact set explodes more than just\nmetaphorically, gains wings and flies away. I'm left wondering if Spielberg is paying the special\neffects budget. Bang your bones said Darwin\nwhen excited, my whole skeleton is in uproar.\nThe cast gets progressively more surreal and\nFreddy Nietzsche and Mary Magdalene go beyond good and evil\nthe whole thing evolves into the best thing this\nreviewer has seen in the last 160 million years.\nSwitching evenly from high brow to sidesplitting in the blink of a line, the plot doesn't fall away and whatever end remains is poignant.\nThe whole thing is rounded up with a blast from\nThey Might be Giants' 'Birdhouse In Your\nSoul'. A more apt a choice could not be imagined,\nyes you're the only bee in my bonnet.

But, while the Gunners were parading\ntheir handsome winnings in sunny Copenhagen,\nI was experiencing a rather different North\nLondon Italian Job and, although the seating\narrangements were a touch more intimate (the\nCourtyard Theatre is a fifty all-seater affair), the\nentertainment was as grand and international as\nany European trophy. Anthony and Cleopatra\n(or Cleoparrtra, in the parlance of Sean Garvey's Caesar) is a brave adaptation of the least\nperformed of all Shakespeare's tragedies.\nIn an attempt to make the play more\naccessible, Adrian Brown, adapter and director,\nlike a press uri sed England manager, has dropped\nall but the central players in the squad. From an\noriginal cast of forty plus, there are now eight\nactors playing nine parts. The individual and\nteam performances are most convincing during\nthe lighter moments. But, because of its very\nslim lined nature, the play seems (inevitably)\nlacking in its more sombre scenes. Despite all\nthis (and the clich ed army motif) I would\nrecommend Marc Anthony over boring Arsenal\nany time.

There are\nprobably some people who won't even venture\nout of bed today for fear of something awful\nhappening. Why is one day in the year worse\nthan any other? And why the number 13? (My\nold school had a lower and upper year 12 instead\nof a year 13 because it was thought to be\nunlucky for people taking their 'A' levels.)\nBut then there's other superstitions like not\nwalking under ladders and throwing salt over\nyour left shoulder if you spill it. Some people\nwill do anything they can to stop the worst\nhappening. I guess that's why people read their\nhoroscopes - they want to know what to expect.\nI personally think it is all in the mind. How\ncan breaking a mirror bring bad luck, and how\ncan one horoscope in a newspaper apply to one\ntwelfth of the population? They are all so\ngeneral that you can read almost anything into\nthem and twist them to your particular\ncircumstances. And why are they never the same\nfrom one paper to another? Maybe it'd be a bit\nmore believable if different astrologers managed\nto come up with the same predictions. After all,\nthey are working with the same set of stars.\nJust in case you are superstitious, there won't be another Friday 13th until January next year.\nMore Publicity.\nHas anyone noticed how Haagen-Dazs ice cream\nis more expensive if you buy it from the shop\nitself than if you go a couple of doors further\ndown Gloucester Road to Harts?

Admittedly it is better than the wooden\nspatulas and plastic bag you get from Harts, but\neven so, I don't think it's worth the extra.\nCredits\nPrinter: Puzzles:\nAndy Thompson Catfish\nBusiness Managers: Sphinx\nSteven Newhouse Photography:\nSimon Govier Diana Harrison\nProofing: Features:\nWei Lee Dennis Saw\nTim St Clair Reviews:\nLynn Bravey Wei Lee (Cinema)\nSimon Shaw Jon Jordan (Music)\nPatrick Wood Patrick Wood (Opera)\nOwain Bennallack Fai Fung (Theatre)\nJoe McFadden Collators Last Week:\nDiana Harrison Penguin\nRebecca Will Towler\nBromiding: Tim St Clair\nAndy Thompson Simon Shaw\nRebecca Patrick Wood\nNews: Ivan Chan\nMike Ingram James Limn\nLynn Bravey Mike Mkpadi\nSimon Shaw\nMissing The Point\nDear Beccy,\nIn response to Yasser Hatami's letter (Felix\n996), I would just like to say that he has\ncompletely missed the point.\nRegardless of what was contained in Salman\nRushdie's book, in this country it is\nunacceptable to murder another person.

You've got a bright future:\na whole life ahead of you. You plan\nto get married to your wonderful\ngirl/boyfriend a few years after\ngraduation - when you've both\nmade that first toehold on the world.\nNow imagine that you are greeted\nby an urgent message: Phone home\nimmediately. You rush off to the\nnearest telephone and you are\ngreeted with your dad's voice. He\ntells you in a low tone that your\nmother has been diagnosed as\nhaving Huntington's Disease. What\ndisease? Hunting who?\nIt takes a while before the gravity\nof the situation seeps in; and you\nrush off to the nearest library to find\nout what Huntington's Disease is.\nYou discover the following:\na. Huntington's Disease (HD)\nafflicts one in every 10,000\nCaucasians of Western European\norigin. It is less common in other\nraces but has been detected in\nalmost all populations studied to\ndate.\nb. It is characterised by a progressive dementia with a middle\nage (35-45 years) onset - an\na sidious wasting of brain cells. It\nresults in the sufferer slowly\nlosing his/her higher mental\nfunctions, gradually becoming\nretarded and succumbing to death\nby secondary complication (heart\ndisease or pneumonia) in about\n17 years.\nc. It is an autosomal dominant\ndisease.\nIf you understand the point c, the\nfull effect of this disease will hit\nyou. 'Autosomal' means that the\ndisease gene is not carried on the sex\n(X or Y) chromosomes. 'Dominant'\nmeans that if one of your parents has\nthe disease (hence the disease gene),\nyou will have a50% chance of\nsuffering from it yourself. 50%\nchance. A flip of a coin gives you\n50% chance of getting either face.\nYou are desperate to know if you\nare afflicted. Had you asked around\nfor a test before November 1983 - to\nsee if you had this time-bomb\nticking inside of you - the answer\nyou would have got was \"No\". And,\nif you were carrying a child, had you\nasked for a test for your foetus, the\nanswer would have been even more\nemphatic.\nYour future shatters. Can you\nbear the responsibility of inflicting\nthis gruesome disease onto your\nunborn children? 50% chance.\nThat was precisely the position\nAlice and Nancy Wexler were in in\n1968. Their mother Leonore was\nfifty-three when she was diagnosed\nwith the disease. She died after ten\nyears of suffering (having tried\nunsuccessfully to take her own life\nin 1970). Because of their\nhelplessness, Nancy and her father,\nMilton, began a crusade to get\nscientists interested in the disease.\nAs a result of the combination of\nimpeccable timing (the flourishing\nof molecular biology and several\nremarkable coincidences of\nscientists being in the right place at\nthe right time) and their cataclysm,\nthe gene was finally located,\nsequenced and published in the\nMarch issue of Cell last year. It had\ntaken more than ten years of arduous\nlabour.\nComing Soon: White Mice Can't Jump also by Dennis Saw\n\n"

    "content": "News 3\nMastering Degrees Rag Fete\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nScience institutions are up in arms\nover the implications of a new type\nof Masters degree proposed by the\nDepartment of Education and\nScience. The Royal Society have\nslammed the scheme in a report\nreleased this week, describing it as\ndamaging and unnecessary.\nThe original proposal, put forward in last year's White Paper on\nScience, stated that anyone intending to take a PhD would need a Masters degree, the idea being to\ngive students the basic skills\nrequired before beginning a three\nyear research programme.\nAfter almost a year of discussion\non the matter, universities, scientists and industry remain united in\ntheir opposition to the degree. The\nScience and Engineering Research\nCouncil calculated that the high\ncost of financing graduate students\nfor an extra year would force it to\nreduce by 30 per cent the number of\nPhD candidates it could fund.\nA new type of degree was proposed by William Waldegrave in\nFebruary. A Research Master\n(MRes) could be undertaken alongside a PhD, preventing the need to\ndelay the start of a PhD by a year. It\nwas also indicated that students\nwho had taken four-year first\ndegrees may not need the MRes.\nSome Universities have expressed enthusiasm for the new\ndegree, but most have decided that\nthe concessions are not enough. In a letter to the Office of Science and\nTechnology, Sir Ronald Oxburgh,\nRector of Imperial College, put forward some concerns. He said that\nthe College \"welcomed most warm-ly\" the idea that seven years of\nstudy and training was required\nfrom the start of a first degree to the\naward of the PhD.\nHe went on to say, however, that\nthe College was \"not at all con-vince d\" that the MRes proposal\nwould \"enhance the quality of PhD\ntraining in ways which could not be\nachieved within the existing academic structure\".\nThe Royal Society holds similar\nviews to the College and instead\nwant more four-year undergraduate\ncourses. In the Society's report on\nthe MRes they commented that\n\"someone with an MRes was likely\nto be labelled a failed PhD\".\n^HnlLlWI'Sfe\n2 Exhibition Road\nLondon SW7\nTelephone 071589 8947\nHappy Hour\n6 - 7pm, Mon - Fri\nEnjoy a free glass of wine or beer on\nyour first visit to your nearest and nicest local restaurant!

South Ken, lng l<H, In b* Students enjoy \"the ultimate colour experience \".\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nStudents took a break from exams\nto visit this year's Rag Fete this\nWednesday on the Queen's Lawn.\nVarious activities were on offer.\nBy far the most popular was the\nAmazin' Colour Maze, an inflatable\nlabyrinth set up by the charity\nTurning Point. One student climbing out of the maze described it as\nthe \"ultimate colour experience\".\nMeanwhile, Imperial College\nUnion's( ICU) sabbaticals, current\nand future, were being pelted with\nwet sponges while they sat in a set\nof stocks. Andy Wensley, ICU President, was the first victim. Jane\nHoyle, Rag Chair, commented how\nsome students were \"eager to have\na go at Andy\". Felix Editor, Beccy\nLand, also took her seat in the\nstocks and described the experience\nas \"wet\".\nAn IC Radio outside broadcast\nand live music from the Jazz and\nRock Club kept students entertained\nas they sat on the lawn.\nHelen Teesdale, one of the Fete\norganisers, said that it had been a great success. There were, however,\ncomplaints from College administration about the noise level, but\nthis problem was soon \"sorted out\".\nStudent comments on the event\nwere varied: \" A distinct lack of ice-creams,\" noted one; \"just not\nenough going on,\" said another.\nMost just soaked up the atmosphere\nand enjoyed the sunshine.\nPortillo Pelted\nBY MIKE INGRAM\nTwo students have been arrested\nafter Conservative MP Michael\nPortillo's car was pelted with eggs.\nMr Portillo, Chief Secretary to\nthe Treasury, was speaking to\nConservative students from the\nLondon School of Economics\n(LSE) on Monday. The speech took\nplace in the Royalty Theatre opposite the School. Mr Portillo's speech was frequently interrupted\nby loud heckling and shouting from\nthe crowd, including a cry of \"slimy\ng it\". He attempted to calm the hecklers down by pointing out their\n\"privileged\" position as students.\nThe ministerial car in which Mr\nPortillo left was pelted with eggs,\nthough only one actually hit it. Two\nmembers of the Socialist Worker's Student Society were arrested. One\ncommented: \"It's a bit wrong arresting us for demonstrating against\nministers who lie about tax rises.\"\nMr Portillo is the second minister to encounter the wrath of LSE students this year. A previous attack\non Education Secretary John Patten\nresulted in him being hit by an egg\nduring a speech.\nFriends of IC Lecture\nA lecture entitled 'Imperial College\nThen and Now' will be given by\nProfessor Bryan Coles on Thursday\n19th May at 6pm. It will be held in\nthe Clore Lecture Theatre, Huxley.\nThe lecture is organised by the\nFriends of Imperial College. More\ninformation is available from\nEleanor Burke on 081 813 1230.

It is the second time the\nevent has happened and this year everything was\nbigger and better, with a marquee on the front, a PA system and lots of prizes supplied by various\nsponsors. More than 20 colleges were\nrepresented with over 100 sailors taking part.\nEven though the wind wasn't up to\nexpectations, the May Bank Holiday sun was\nintense and bodies were bronzing rapidly - after\nall, that is what windsurfing is all about isn't it?!\nOver the three days freestyle, slalom and\ncourse racing disciplines were run for the more\naccomplished sailors in division 1, with slalom\nevents for the novices in division 2. Imperial\nwas well represented in all events and not just on\nthe beach. Will, in particular, was the first to\nmake a name for himself by dancing with\nanyone (or anything) in the bar on the first night,\nincluding an Elvis look-a like.\nIn terms of windsurfing events, the novice\nteam achieved an impressive second place in the\noverall rankings. In division 1 the freestyle event\nwas convincingly dominated by Imperial with\nthe first four places going to Tim 'sail 360'\nWilkes (4th), James 'everything' Slaughter\n(3rd), James 'rail ride' Mayhew (2nd) and Dan 'I like to somersault through the boom' Laurijssen,\nwho is now the British Student Freestyle\nchampion - well done Dan!\nThe remaining slalom and course events were\nrun depending on the state of the wind and an\noverall ranking was constructed. After proving\nhis competence at freestyle, Tim Wilkes went on\nto win the title of Bic National Student\nWindsurfing Champion with Imperial coming\nsecond in the team event.\nUnfortunately, Imperial didn't win any prizes\nin the ladies events, simply due to extreme\nunder-representation, like we had no women! So\nif there are any women out there who are\ninterested in windsurfing or just like to do it\nstanding up, then contact Imperial College\nBoardsailing Club through Paul Cooper, Mech\nEng III. You never know, you may become a future windsurfing champion.\nThe weekend was not all windsurfing though.\nOn Sunday night there was a Mayor's reception\n(free food!) followed by a team pub crawl\ncompetition around Clacton, ending up in a local\nnightclub where we danced and drank the night\n(and most of the morning) away.\nAs for the coming months, the Boardsailing\nClub is pretty well wrapped up until the start of\nnext term, so all that remains to be said is: \"See\nyou at Freshers' Fair!\"\nDune in May from ics fA film review is a delicate thing. Know then that\non Tuesday 17th May at 7pm in the Concert\nHall, ics f are pleased to present David Lynch's epic film Dune.\nThe story revolves around the desolate, desert\nworld of Arrakis (also known as Dune) which is\nthe sole source of the hallucinogenic spice-gas\nmelange. The actual spice production remains a mystery to the Spacing Guild who, along with\nthe Emperor of the Known Universe, regulate its\nsupply to their Navigators who use it to travel\nwithout motion; only the enigmatic Fremen\ninhabitants of Arrakis understand its connection\nto the giant sandworm s which patrol the planet's surface.\nInto this hostile world are thrown House\nAtreides to take over spice mining after the\nseeming departure of their sworn enemies House\nHarkonnen. As Paul Atreides, son of a noble\nduke and a Bene-Gesserit witch, is plunged\ndeeper into the web of political machinations\nwhich surround Arrakis he begins to question\nwhether he is the messiah so long awaited by the\nFremen and, if so, can he marshall their\nscattered tribes to end the mining on Arrakis and\ntransform the desert planet into a paradise?\nGorgeously shot and stunningly designed,\nthis is a film to be seen on the big screen. Lynch\nproves that he can sustain a lengthy film without\nresorting to weirdness with his excellent\ndirection of every aspect: visuals, sound, acting\nand effects combine impeccably.\nOh yes, I forgot to tell you...admission is\n\u00a31.50 to ics f members and \u00a32 to non-members.\nMembership is just \u00a33 and includes free entry to\nDune along with the chance to borrow over\n3,000 books, graphic novels and videos from our\nlibrary in the corner of Beit Quad. The dream\nunfolds Tuesday at 7pm.
