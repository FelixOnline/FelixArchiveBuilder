    "content": "WALKA80UTLOOKSEE\nby Ntbile Optics lite.\nIn the Sixties London was swinging: Elvis\nPresley and Marilyn Monroe were replaced on\nthis side of the Atlantic by the Beatles, Twiggy\nand the mini-skirted pop scene in Carnaby\nStreet. We were brought up on the move-ment's tail end and with the cynical acceptance\nof the 80s, can only guess at the awe and\noptimism with which the (almost) previous\ngeneration embraced the explosion of mass-media advertising, mass-produced fashion fads\nand all-pervasive commercial 'culture'.\nThe art of the 60s was concerned with\nsc rut in ising the 'new' language of the ad men,\nthe mid-20th Century urban folk art we all\nabsorb subconsciously. It is an art which relies\nfor visual and emotional impact on the symbols\nand images of our everyday materialistic\nworld, as we see it and react to it through TV,\nnewspapers, comic strips, girl ie magazines,\nglossies, billboards, etc. Pop artists are not\npainting about 'life'\u2014their experiences and\nemotions\u2014but rather about an advertising/\npackaging type of lifestyle.\nPeter Blake\nIt seems almost inconceivable that anyone can\nbe consistently optimistic about a Sunday\nmagazine lifestyle! Peter Blake was a student\nat the Royal College of Art in the 1950s and his\nPop period paintings draw freely on popular\nsources of imagery for inspiration. Yet, if there\nis a hint of melancholy, there is no aggro\u2014he\npaints what he enjoys and infuses it with\nnostalgia and sentimentality.\nThe paintings are not all easy, but most are\nfigurative, which provides a key to their\nunderstanding. A series of paintings of girls\nand boys, and his 1961 'Self Portrait with\nBadges' open his major retrospective at the\nTate.\nThey are followed by circus ladies, by Pop\nworks with pin-ups and fan magazine photos\nMarilyn Monroe, who provides the inspiration\nfor some of-Peter Blake's paintings.\n(not a section for WIST members!) and by a collection of prize fight heroes and strippers.\nDuring the 70s Blake left London to live in\nan old West Country railway station. He\nformed the Brotherhood of Ruralists and this\nperiod of countryside idyll is recorded with\npictures of children and fairies and the well-known 'Through the Looking Glass' illustrations. A traditional 'painterly' manner\nPeter Blake is a hoarder of bits and a Romantic: there is a Victorian element, even to\nhis Pop collage-collections, filled with\nevocative memorabilia and scrap-book\nclippings. He is also a painter in the traditional\nsense. One room is devoted to his exquisite\nwatercOlours and another to precise drawings\nof finely observed circus people, animals and\ncorners of country life; this strong sense of\ndrawing is allied to a bright, fresh handling of\npaint and an obvious enjoyment of his subject-matter. I'm not de spar at ely keen on his\nsensual fairies but his 1975 'Academy' collage\nis a delightful joke and'Portrait of David\nHockney in a Hollywood-Spanish Interior'\ncontrasts razzmatazz party glitter with\nthe sitter's ambiguous reaction as onlooker-it's technically superb even in it's unfinished\nstate.\nWhere, When, E? 'Peter Blake' is at the Tate Gallery, Millbank\nSW1 until March 20. It's open Mon-Sat 10-1750, Sun 14-1750. Admission 75p for\nstudents, otherwise \u00a31.50.\nPIN CCC MIC Of Bars and Bars\nAs you hopefully will have noticed, next Friday\nsees another orchestra concert, and\nrehearsals are in full swing even now.\nUnfortunately, the predilection of the\norchestra for Mahler, Tchaikovsky and\nWalton is exceeded only by their predilection\nfor alcohol. last week the conductor, Rich T Biscuit (no relation to Duncan Biscuit) found\nthat a lot of the string section had gone\nmissing. Realising that they would be in the\nQueens Legs, the local hostelry, he headed\nover there, to find twenty five of them\nindulging in drinking.\nA word or two about string players is\nnecessary here. Unlike brass players, who\ndrink as often as possible, string players only\ndrink if they are standing on the vertex of a square formed by other string players. For\ninstance, in diagram 1, a string player standing\nat A can drink, while a string player standing at\nB can not.\nB/ is I A Diagram 1\nRich found the 25 string players standing in a formation shown in diagram 2. Since he did not\nactually need the string section at that time,\nbut he would need them sober later on, he\nwanted to remove as few people as possible,\nwhile ensuring that the remainder, unless they\nmoved, would not be able to drink. Can you\nsay how few people he needs to remove, and\ncan you give a sample pattern that the\nremainder would take up, assuming they don't move?\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office by 1:00pm Wednesday. \u00a35 from\nMend a Bike and two free tickets to the\norchestra concert lor a randomly selected\ncorrect entry.\nLast Week's Solution\nAlgebraic Numbers\nThere were twelve people who found an\nexpression to give 4. A lot of people seemed to\nhave a lot of tun with this one, from Phil Fisher\nand Richard Glovers recommendation that I should take base seventeen, to Duncan\nBaldwin's thoughts of differentiating with\nrespect to n. The four best ideas are shown\nbelow. The winning entry came from Reginald\nTan of Chem Eng 2, and he can collect his \u00a35\ncheque from the FELIX Office on Monday\nafter 1:30pm. As for who found the most: since an infinity\nof numbers can be generated by taking\nfactorial s, on the grounds of neatness and\nstyle, Leann Jones of Maths 2 and AM Watkin\nof Aero 2 tied for the Jingles haircut voucher,\nand by the tried and trusted method of tossing\na coin, the voucher was awarded to AM Watkin, who can collect the voucher from the\nFELIX Office.\n4= JH+Jn\nn'W TT where primes denote\n/ -ri' differentiation wr tn ln(nx n) In V rT In\nl|5r T^n*n taking the In in base v^ rf\nI\\ Factfcwjiea..\nDiagram 2\nAngling Corner\nOnly two entries to this, from Perola and\nPaul Elson of Mech Eng 1, but I hope it was\ninteresting.\nThe first thing to notice about right acute\nangles is that an angle is a right acute angle if\nand only if both its sine and its cosine are\nrationals (ie can be expressed as p/q. where\nboth p and q are integers). Now if we take a multiple of any right acute angle,\nsin(nA) = sin(A+(n l)A)=s in A co s((nl) A)t cosAs in(( ni)A) cos(nA) = cos(A+(n l)A)= cosA co s((nl) A)s in A sin((n l)A) and nA is therefore a right acute angle by an\neasy inductive argument.\nWe can thus without loss of generality, complete the proof by considering the angle A+B, where both A and B are right acute angles, and\nthis again follows from\nsin(A+B)=s in A co sB+s in B cosA, and\ncos(A+B)= cosA co sBs in As in B, both clearly\nbeing rational.\nNo Footnotes this week, as 1 want to keep\nsome in store for next term when I don't have\nas much time.

    "content": "MANIFESTOS\nCandidates\nfor the post of DEPUTY PRESIDENT\nof IC\nUnion\nDuncan\nBATTY\nproposed by George Plumbly\nIt wasn't until seven years ago that Deputy\nPresident was made a sabbatical post. The\nreasons were quite simple, there was a need for\nsomeone to handle the financial side of the\nclubs and societies within ICU, and to be\nresponsible for the upkeep and security of\nUnion run premises.\nThe side of the job which has been developed\nis that of looking after the Union Building.\nEven so there is still a lot of room for\nimprovement. For example, there has been a few occasions this year when JCR events have\nbeen closed early by Security, due to a lack of\ncommunication between security and bookings\noffice. It is details like this that need to be\nclarified, which as Deputy President I will be\nable to sort out. It is also important for the\nDeputy President to be on hand at any time of\nthe day especially in matters of security. This is\nhelped if you know most of the security guards\non a personal basis, which I do.\nThe part of the job which has not been\ndeveloped over the years is that of financial\nadvisor. This, I think, is the more important\npart of the DP's work. We have seen this year\nhow, when faced with cutbacks, the Major\nSub-Committees and the CCUs could not\nagree on estimates for next year. As Deputy\nPresident, I will endeavour that estimates will\nbe within budget before putting them to a full\nUFC; Thus eliminating most of the arguments.\nOther tasks for the Deputy President are\nlooking after regalia. As I have helped the last\ntwo RCS HJTs with regalia, I know how to\norder and maintain stocks for the Southside\nShop. This is a new side to the job which is still\nin its infancy, and new\n(cut at 300th word-Ed)\nDuncan Batty did not submit a photograph with his manifesto.\nColin COOPER\nproposed by John Ferguson\nWhy I am ideally suited to the job of ICU\nDeputy President\n1. As a member of House Committee I have\nbeen involved in running the Union Building\nfacilities, and as an organiser of many events I have knowledge of its strengths and weak-ness es.2. I have a number of Fresh ideas to\nimprove Union facilities and open them to a wider range of students. Expansion of\nSouthside Shop into a mini supermarket to\nreduce prices, improvement of the booking\nprocedure for Union rooms to make it efficient\nand ensure events take place in suitable rooms\nregarding noise and damage.\n3. Over the last two years I have been a keen\nobserver of the relationship between the Union\nand College, particularly the Bar and\nRefectory Committees. I proposed the U GM motion on Bar Accounts that exposed the dual\nloyalties of student representatives, and opened\nthe management to scrutiny.\nCollege Refectories have been a source of\njokes and election promises for many years.\nManagement difficulties are the real root of the\nproblem and I would press for changes to\nimprove efficiency and so improve the food!\n4. I stand for more open administration\nrather than clandestine decisions that are\npresented as fait ac com pl is. I shall encourage\nopen debate.\nFor example reduction of Union income\nmust be tackled by informed discussion of\npossible economies rather than cloak and\ndagger warfare. CCUs and major subcommittees both have good claim to adequate\nfunding, but both must be prepared to account\nfor their expenditure to all.\nI stand for a fresh, informed and open\napproach.\nChristine\nTELLER\nproposed by David Molesworth\nWhy will I make a good DP?\nI have a wide experience of all aspects of\nimperial College Union.\nI have organised and participated in many\nsocial events both in the Union Building\noutside. I know the building and services\nprovided, very well, and have worked as non\nsabbatical Deputy President for several\nmonths. I have sat on Union Finance\nCommittee and House Committee for two\nyears respectively, and have initiated changes\non both, particularly the provision of a sensible\ndecoration programme and a better allocation\nof the equipment fund.\nThe main disadvantage that a sabbatical\nofficer faces is the lack of continuity and\nknowledge. I am already known and respected\nin College and I believe this is the key to\nproducing real change. Any other policy\nsimply leads to the Union not being consulted\nand consequently being ineffectual. I will press\nfor an increase in equipment expenditure. This\nis the soundest investment ICU can make and I am the person most capable of effecting this.\nI believe that the sporting and club activities\nare the heart of Imperial College Union. I will\nwork to promote the facilities available, and to\nimprove the efficiency of services within the\nUnion Building and sources of income such as\ngames machines and bookings. I am presently\nimproving the supply of sports goods in the\nSouthside Shop and I will continue to work to\nexpand this new venture.\nElect me as the best 'man' for the job.\nPage 101 March 4,19831 IFELIX\n\n"

SECRETARY\nof IC\nUnion\nSean DAVIS\nproposed by John Passmore\nI am proposing Sean Davis for Hon Sec\nbecause I feel he has the qualities to do the job\nwell. He is not boring, has the organisational\nability to do the basics of the job such as\nminute-taking, UG Ms, Exec News and\ninsurance well. However it is important that\nthe Hon Sec takes a greater part in the running\nof the Union as a whole, this is where you can\nbenefit from electing Sean Davis.\nJohn Passmore\nAt the moment I have no experience with\nUnion affairs apart from hearing students say\nthat the union officers are completely useless\nand don't concern themselves with the needs\nand interests of the ordinary student. These I believe ,are played-out clich es. I feel however\nthat my keenness and motivation will more\nthan compensate for any lack of knowledge of\nthe job. The Hon See's job description lists the\nmundane and essential parts of the work to be\ndone. Anyone who is organised and efficient\ncould do the job, it is what the person elected\ndoes beyond the job description that is\nimportant. Remember that the first three\nmonths of the sabbatical post are from July to\nSeptember in which the people elected can\nlearn the basics.\nThe Hon Sec should become more involved\nin policy decisions and the day to day running\nof the union as a whole, such things as finance,\nservices, major sub-committees and CCUs are\nof major importance.\nOn the main issues concerning the Union my\nviews are:\nNUS: Too expensive and too political.\nRefectories: I do not promise to produce five\nstar restaurants but I will try to improve the\nstandard of the food.\nAccommodation: This is one of the main\nproblems facing IC students and is one issue on\nwhich a much tougher line is needed.\nSean C Davis\nChas FULLER\nproposed by Simon Moore\nThe Honorary Secretary's job officially entails\ntwo major activities\u2014the administration of IC\nUnion and its committees and secondly to\n'bring to the attention of the Executive\nCommittee any matters which require a \"political\" decision and shall not regard any\n\"non-administrative\" items outside the\nHonorary Secretary's sphere of activity'. I have\nshown that I can do the former task by my\ncommitment to RCSU\u2014I have worked as Rag\nTreasurer, Honorary Junior Treasurer and this\nyear as Honorary Secretary\u2014doing anything\nfrom Gestetnering to running elections to\norganising dinners. However, I have not\nignored IC Union and I have observed at or sat\non Council, Union Finance, Bookshop and IC\nRag Committees. From attending these\nmeetings I have gained useful information\nCharles Fuller did not submit a photograph with his manifesto.\nwhich will enable me to play an active role in\nthe 'non-administrative' part of the job. I would like to see next year's Sabbatical\nOfficers trying to improve College-life by\nintroducing significant changes in the\nrefectory-system, bars, the Union building and\nproperty, IC Rag and even in the Union\nDirectory. This can be achieved only by a concerted effort by each member of the\nExecutive and not just the President.\nThere is a third part of the Honorary\nSecretary's job which, although not in the\nofficial job description, is very important\u2014a sabbatical should ensure that he or she is\nsociable and approachable. I believe that I am\nthe best candidate who is standing for\nHonorary Secretary not only for the reasons\noutlined above but also because I have spent\nmy time at IC working for the benefit of other\npeople and not for my own 'political' gain.\nI believe that I am the best candidate which\nmeans that YOU will benefit if you vote for me.\nChas Fuller\nJohn SATTAUR\nproposed by Mike Mallick\nJohn Sattaur is not a hack!\nAs most will be able to tell you John is one\nof the few people that can be trusted and relied\nupon to get on with the job.\nThough he has not been directly involved\nwith the union he has sufficient experience\nthrough SCC and other societies to know what\nis going on. In fact he started the Third World\nFirst Society from scratch, drawing up its\nconstitution and running it successfully.\nJohn does not wish to confine himself simply\nto the role of the Hon See's job but also wants\nto involve himself in student matters.\nRemember it does not need to be just up to the\npresident what happens here.\nJohn Sattaur's the name,\u2014he's not a hack!\nMike Mallick\nThe Hon Sec is responsible for the smooth\nadministration, of the union, and at its most\nbasic level, it is a low key, hard working job. I have not been directly involved in the\nfunctioning of the Union. However, I have\nshown myself capable of taking on new\nresponsibilities in setting up Imperial College\nThird World First Society, which I consider to\nbe one of the more active SCC societies. I also\nplayed a large part in organising and\ncoordinating its Anti-Poverty Action Week\nearlier this term.\nThe fundamentals of the job require\norganisation, efficiency and competence. I would very much like to raise the job above its\nbasic mundane level, and to try and organise\none or more college-wide events in the same\nvein as Human Rights Week.\nI consider myself to have the basic qualities\nnecessary for a good Hon Sec, together with\nthe will to raise the job to a more active level,\nboth within the Union, and on a College wide\nbasis.\nIf you think so too, why not vote for me on\nMarch 7-8.\nFELIXI March 4,1983 Pagell\n\n"

Highlights were Ben's breast stroking victory and Jim\nhanging on to win the IM. The\n'lows' included Rich'spits top in\nthe freestyle although recovering\nto take second place. Score: 73-56 to them.\nDespite having the Newquay\nZoo Snake House (Python and\nBig (?) Brother Anaconda) we\nwent down 5-1 against Oxford.\nGuys were put off though and\nwe won 10-2. Rich and Jims new\ntactic of tackling each other and\nleaving the ball for the opposition causes concern. Ta to Pete\n(?), Anaconda and Fiona's costume; and bollocks to those\nwho didn't turn up.\nPS: The exec would appreciate\nif the other half of the team\nwould turn up on Monday (vs\nIsleworth).\nSupport also required\u20147\no 'clock Sportscentre.\nVolleybal\nImperial College Volleyball\nClub met Bristol Polytechnic last\nSaturday in the Quarterfinal of\nthe EVA National Students Cup.\nBristol were last year's runner-up in this competition, and so it\nwas perhaps quite a shock to\nthem to find such a strong\nImperial team. Despite a nervous start in the first set, which\nwe lost 15-9, Imperial rallied to\nclaim the second, the score at a close 17-15. However, the\nsurprise of the match came in the\nthird set when we went into a quick 7-1 lead, and needed a total of only eight minutes to\nwin by an incredible 15-1\nmargin. The fourth set saw some\nimpressive play from both sides,\nBristol having been roused by a talk from their ex-England\nInternational player/coach\nKeith Nicholls, and IC went\ndown 15-11, leaving the fifth set\nthe decider. The scores remained\nnearly level till 6-5 for Bristol,\nand then the experience, team\nplay and better coaching of the\nopposition began to tell. An injury to our star setter Man\nLam ('diabolically painful!')\ndidn't help, and IC exited\ngracefully, the score 9-15.\nOn the whole, it was an\nexcellent, well fought match\nwhich, with a bit of luck, might\nhave gone our way but kudos to\nBristol for inflicting on us our\nfirst defeat in two years (in\nEngland, at any rate!).\nMy thanks to all the IC team,\nnamed below, for a splendid\neffort, maybe we'll do it next\nyear. Also thanks to all the\nspectators for taking the trouble\nto come and watch, and cheer us\non, and the poor suckers I roped\nin as linesmen and score keepers at the last minute.\nA quick reminder that on\nWednesday March 9 we are at\nhome to Tottenham College,\nwho are not a weak team, so see\nyou all at 14:00 at the court.\nIC team: M Lam (Capt), C Christou, A Green, A Knap, D Song, P Peplinksi, P Walker, A, Hedges, M James.\nFootball\nFirsts\nIC vs Goldsmiths 4-0\nA fine performance on the eve of\nthe cup-final totally demolished\nthe opposition. Some scintillating high speed football resulted\nin IC leading 4-0 at half-time\nwith Stephenson recording a hat-trick of real class. The\nsecond goal was a gem; four one\ntouch passes saw the ball move\nfrom the IC defence past a bemused QM C goalkeeper. John\nMcGuckin had a fine game in\nmid-field as did John Rigby and\nNick Flannagan up front.\nCup Final\nOn Saturday March 5 IC 1st XI\ndefend the University of London Intercollegiate Challenge Cup which they won last\nyear. With this in mind the team\nhad intended to go for a week's altitude training in the Himilayas, but due to academic\ncommitment and total confidence this was changed to a team\nworkout in the Queen's on\nFriday afternoon. IC will hope\nto call on the experience gained\nin last year's final to overcome\nUC. The team will be chosen\nfrom the following squad or\nplayers: Harlow, Curran, Reeve,\nGriffiths, Dunhill, McGuckin,\nPage, Gas kill, Stephenson,\nRigby, Rickard, Chamberlain,\nLay and Laurence (one more\nand we'd have a rugby team).\nCoaches leave the Union at\n1:15pm for Motspur and will be\nfree; the ride not the coaches?!\nAll support would be welcomed.\nFELIX II March 4,19831\nKO Cup\nIC vs QM C110 This report is hereby dedicated\nto Janet Folkes.

This\nreport is a testament to her\nability, tenacity, radiance etc\n(sorry if I over did this a bit\nJanet!).\nTo move on. We won the\ncup!! We won it easily!! The\nteam played brilliantly. At last\nwe've found the winning for-mula. Pre-match preparation\nwas calculated to produce a devastating effect. Ian's pallid\ncolour and retching noises were\nused to good effect. Dominic\nclosely resembled a member of\nthe undead fraternity and Janet\nEllis tried to make up for her\ntiredness by dazzling all and\nsundry with a knockout k track-suit!\nClass was provided by Lee,\nAndreOe and Huf Chrisslet.

Still she's got a long way to go to match\nIan who is in danger of igniting\nhimself.\nCongratulations to everyone\nfor such a resounding victory. I think we even eclipsed the\nBermondsey by-election as\nvictory of the year.\nOn a serious note\u2014could\neveryone wanting to go to\nIreland hurry up and tell me\u2014or\nelse I 'll go spare!!\nAlso, we have been challenged\nto a darts match by the Chess\nClub.

    "content": "Sense and the\nCensor\nLooking back over my chequered history of\nfilm reviewing\u2014all six months of it\u2014I notice\nthat I have very few 'X', or '18' as they are now\ncertified, films on my files. When I was under\nage, ah those dimly remembered far off days, I seem to remember that all the really good films\nwere Xs. Perhaps I noticed the X films more\nbecause I couldn't see them, or I thought they\nmust be good because adults went to see\nrh em; perhaps they represented a challenge to\nmy adolescent instinct to dare and see them\nregardless; I don't know\u2014just the impression\npersists. What this is all driving at is\nspeculation on what passes with the censor\nthese days. Have we moved into a new era of\nlight and enlightenment? Films like A MidSummers Night Sex Comedy and An Officer\nand a Centeleman both contained scenes\nwhich left little to the imagination but failed to\nobtain the censors seal of disgust and\ndegradation. However, two films this week\nCousins in Love and Class of 1984 ;did\nmanage to achieve the ultimate a cola de, and\nquite rightly too. The criteria seems to be that\nas long as it's good, healthy, normal sex and\nnot too gory violence (no blood ly headless\ntorso es gaily flying about) then it's OK by Lord\nHarlech and his merry men.\nn mm nice\nSeems somewhat dubious logic to me. The\npoor old fifteen year old is probably having\nenough trouble plucking up the bottle to talk\nto the girl at the bus-stop he fancies without\nthe silver screen taunting him with lovers gaily\nsetting too to the detriment of the bed springs at\nthe first sign of mutual interest. Anyway, enough\nspace filling for one week. To say that Cousins\nin Love, Cert 18, directed by David Hamilton\nplaying at the Cinecenta, Panton Street and\nSiudio, Oxford Circus was a bit of a bore\nwoUld not be stretching a point. The plot: well\nthe j seem to do without one of those. What\n:-.K?S up the ninety minutes from the opening\ntitles to the credits are a series of sexual\nencounters of great enthusiasm and varying\nexpertise and of no real point. Not that there's anything wrong with a good encounter or two,\nbut just about everyone screws everybody\nREVIEWS\nelse, except for the poor old professor who\ngoes around filling ballon s with distilled souls\nand releasing them. My theory is that he was in\na previous David Hamilton film but failed to\nescape from the set in time. Faced with the\ntiring business of all that humping again and\ndeciding that the old ticker just wouldn't take\nit, he invented this whole spurious sub-plot for\nhimself, which has absolutely nothing to do\nwith the rest of the film, just to keep himself\noccupied while the rest of the cast dutifully get\non with the horizontal, or sometimes vertical,\ncallisthenics. Perhaps the next film will contain\nan entire legion of frazzled, exhausted old\neccentrics doing silly things whilst only the real\ndie-hard s get on with the main picture. One of\nthe characters, Claire, has obviously sus sed that she is in a low budget porno-flick and\nspends most of the picture straightening out\nhem-lines and plucking out unwanted body\nhairs. Normally a futile exercise but not nearly\nas futile as trie rest of the film. Perhaps there's something badly wrong with me; perhaps I should phone Claire Raynor to find out why I don't find ninety minutes of beautiful people\nmaking love in sun-bathed rustic settings\nerotic and gripping; why couldn'tIe mpa this e with Julien who only gets the chance to knock\noff the ones he really likes when all the big men\ngo off to fight the war? The blossoming of this\nadolescent into a full man. Who knows? You\npays your money...as they say. I can't really\nimagine why you'd want to go and see it; a good chuckle with the lads or to get a reluctant\ngirlfriend in the mood to come-back-to-your-place; pretty dreadful stuff, with dubbed\ndialogue just to round it off.\nSo without more ado we move onto Class\nof 1984 Cert 18, directed by mark Lester,\nshowing at the Leicester Square Theatre. It\nwas not, as they say, well received at the\npreview. There was the usual gang who feel it's clever to laugh a lot when they find a film\nridiculous and the occasional exit by those\nwho had decided they had seen enough to\ncondemn it from their lofty pinnacles. Me, I stayed without any great difficulty to the final\ncurtain.\nThe story is set in Abraham Lincoln High\nSchool which, it transpires, is run not by the\nteachers, but by a gang of thugs lead by a Mr\nStegman, powerfully played by Timothy van\nPatton. They organise drug pushing,\nprostitution, theft and any other sort ot crime\nthey take a fancy to among their fellow pupils.\nBut enter our hero, Andy Norris who decides\nhe's going to clear the gang out of the school\nand put Stegman and his men behind bars.\nThus the battle escalates, spilling out of school\nonto the streets and into one another's houses. The police can't do much because the\ntroublemakers are juveniles and the principal\n:\"'\u00a7 | fI\nmB \u2122\nmm\n\" \u2122 Me Teaching...the reward/punishment way\nGet it right and you keep your head.\nis loth to take action unless the thugs are\ncaught red handed.\nHowever, what starts off as a promising\ncommentary on the contemporary problems\nof juvenile deli que n cy and urban decay rapidly\ndescends through mindless violence into pure\nfarce as the director lets slip his sense of\nrealism and goes for the popular blood and\nguts market, and there's plenty of it.\nDoes Mr Lester see his piece as a prophetic\nview of the future, or lack of one, of the\nteaching profession as his production blurb\nseems to suggest? Does he see a school as a potential arena of conflict and exploit it to the\nfull? Is his school to be taken as an allegory for\nsociety as a whole? Well, all I can say is that on\nme if failed; ludicrous pieces of philosophy\nsuch as that intoned by Mr Stegman take\nsome swallowing: 'I am the future...pain is\neverything. Life is pain. You will learn...' he\ngrowls. Belief was not sustained in the fact and\nthe allegory was not explained. Perhaps I found it easier to take than the mob who\nheaded for the exit; in their s pawing grounds\nof Eton and Harrow, organised violence came\nin the form of a good birching at regular\nintervals; should they have contemporary\nexperience of an American high school, they\nmight have found it disturbing rather than silly\nat times.\nSo, while flawed by a rather OTT climactic\nscene and the unbelievable in com pet ance of\nthe authority figures, it is a powerful film with\ngood acting from Penny King as the teacher\ncome to cleanse the temple and Timothy van\nPatten as the pathological teenager with a neat\nperformance from the veteran Roddy\nMcDowall, a teacher who discovers that\nlessons at gunpoint give his teaching a whole\nnew flavour. Mr Lester must decide whether\nhe wants to make movies for a serious purpose\nor if he is into the gratuitous violence game.\nMr Stegman wants to ask you a question.\nFELIXI I March 4,19831 IPagel5\n\n"

    "content": "Recent newspaper articles have reported widespread dismissals of academic staff in Turkish\nUniversities by the military regime. Now two Turkish 'academics' are on a recruitment visit to\nBritain.\nBEWARE TURKS BEARING GIFTS\nOn February 19 two Turkish\nacademics arrived for a tour of\nBritish Universities. One of these\ngentlemen missed his appointment at Sussex University because his luggage had been\nmisdirected. Hardly the stuff to\nget worked up about.\nBut a few days earlier on\nFebruary 16, tucked away in the\noverseas news section of The\nGuardian, a short news item\nraised quite a few eyebrows:\nAbout 220 university teachers\nhave now been dismissed as\npart of an attempt to create a strictly centralised university\nsystem giving politically\n'reliable' education.\nAlthough the latest dismissals were carried out by\nmartial law authorities,\nuniversity staff suspect that\nthe decisions of whom to\ndismiss are taken by the all-powerful High Education\nCouncil set up by the mili-tar y.... Most dismissed teachers lose their pensions and\nthe right to teach or work in\nthe public service again. They\nalso find it hard to get a passport.\nBritain this week becomes\nthe first country to offer\nhospitality to the new university establishment in\nTurkey when a dean from the\nMiddle East Technical University (METU) Dr Yahya\nTezel begins a two-week tour\nof British universities as a guest of the British Council.\nThe story eventually unfolded\ndespite the predictable fog of\nofficial jargon and evasion. The\ngood doctors Kemal Guru z( specialist subject: energy and\ncoal technology) and Yahya\nTezel (former lefty and eco no mist) would be on a British\nCouncil sponsored jaunt of the\nuniversity circuit in Britain to\nrecruit British academics to\nreplace their purged counterparts in Turkey. They will soon\nbe knocking on the doors of\nImperial College ostensibly to\ncreate 'closer links with MET U and IC and no doubt offer\nlucrative jobs and contracts to\nIC academic staff.\nNow, if you approve of a university system which turns all\n'Turkey is in a position of vital importance on the edge of a frightening\nwhirlpool of international conflict and instability.'\nacademics into civil servants,\nenforces a regulation banning\nmoustaches and beards and\nreintroduce s the equivalent of\nschool uniforms (see The Guardian, 5/2/83), appoints university\nvice-chancellors and sets out a single national standard curriculum for all higher education,\nplease by all means catch the\nnext plane to Ankara or Istanbul. You will get roughly four\ntimes the salary received by your\nTurkish colleague (\u00a3250pm) who\nmay be just as well qualified as\nyou. Further perks include\nlecture halls 'supervised' by\narmy officials (in case any young\nundergraduate's concentration\nwanders off), compulsory attendance in lectures and a docile\nstudent body, expected to learn\nby rote and faithfully reproduce\nthe wisdom imparted by the\nGod-head lecturer. You will be\ngiven powers whereby a stu-dent's whole life and career\ndepend on the marks and\n'confidential comments' which\nwill be passed on regularly from\nyou to the faculty dean. Of course, you will need a 'security\nclearance' yourself so stash away\nthose tell-tale C ND badges and\nother evidence of subversion\nsuch as The Guardian. But the\npin-stripe suit, a skinhead\nhaircut and a regulation shave\n(no facial hair or side-boards)\nshould do the trick.\nYou may have seen London\ndouble-decker s parading an\nadvertisement for people to take\ntheir summer holidays in Turkey. It goes something like:\n'Turkey: One Country, Two\nContinents'. In truth is should\nread 'one country, two continents\u2014no democracy'. Since\nSeptember 1980 when the country was overrun by generals,\nTurkey has been turned into one\nbig problem.\nDespite Turkey's membership\nin the European Council, NATO and associate links with the EEC which link it with European\npolitics and institutions, the\nmilitary regime has dismantled\nany semblance of democracy. As\na leader in that other notorious\nsubversive newspaper The\nFinancial Times commented, the\ngenerals who run the country are\nintent to shut Turkish society\ninside a cage of tight bureaucratic controls. Individual liberties, freedom of the press,\ntrade union rights and the\ndemocratic rights to assembly\nand association have all been,\ndisposed of. Some 50.000 people\nare in gaol and Amnesty International has do cr riL' n ted70 deaths in detention due to\ntorture.\nThe reason for the coup as\nwell as its aftermath are painfully obvious.

    "content": "Elections\nIn case you hadn't noticed, on\nMonday and Tuesday of next\nweek the. sabbatical elections will\nbe held. IC Union pays four\nstudents the equivalent of \u00a36,000\neach to enable them to take a year off studying and work full-time as President, Deputy President, Honorary Secretary\nand FELIX Editor. As I said last\nweek, if you want to make\nsure this money is well spent (and\nyou ought to, if you have any\nconcern at all for clubs, sports,\nCCUs, concerts, publications or\nany of the hundred and one\nfacilities the Union provides)\nthen it is essential that you get\ninformed on the aptitude of the\nvarious candidates and elect the\nmost suitable into office. Last\nweek I spoke of the importance\nof attending yesterday's Hustings\nU GM: this week I shall presume\nto advise you on deciding whom\nto support.\nStarting with the negative side\nof things, you should not be\ninfluenced by colour, race, sex or\nother peripherals. This may\nseem obvious, but some people\nstill make their decisions on\nsuch issues: Mary Freeman\nwould never have had such a large majority last year had she\nnot been female.\nA wise candidate will choose\nan eloquent proposer, but you\nshould not be influenced by him.\nThe proposer's job is to put\nforward any qualities which\nmodesty may prevent the candidates themselves making. Always\nremember that the proposer has\nnothing to do with how well the\ncandidates will do their job.\nBear in mind that most\ncandidates will have asked\nsomeone else to produce their\npublicity. Poster design should\nnot therefore influence you,\nexcept, perhaps, when a candidate for FELIX Editor has\nproduced his own publicity.\n\u2022 iii iii iiii iiii_ i_t_ i_i~i~i \u2014\n.11 ii~i~ i\"f LAST MONDAY FORTNIGHT I was approached by a complete\nstranger in Southside Bar. 'I 've\nbeen asked to give you this,' he\nsaid, presenting me with a magnificent satin-lined woollen cloak. I expressed some\npuzzlement over whether this\nwas really intended for me.\n'Oh yes,' said the stranger. ' A friend of yours gave it to me to\ngive to you.' I carefully enquired\nas to the identity of this mysterious benefactor and my fears\nwere confirmed when I was\ngiven the visiting card of the\ncoat's owner and read with a FELIX HH LH HH MBH M EDITORIAL\nv^ Finally in this catalogue of\nmistrust, remember that in manifestos and hustings speeches\nsome candidates are tempted to\nexaggerate, distort or even to lie\noutright about their qualification\nin the past and their ideas for the\nfuture. Weigh up their promises,\nand consider whether their\nsuggestions are as realistic as\nthey first appear. Don't forget\nStephen Goulder's promise of a refectory boycott! (On the other\nhand you can't complain if a candidate does implement his\npromises: Stephen Goulder also\npromised in his election bum f to\nsupport clubs and societies\nfinancially at the expense of the\nCCUs).\nSo what should you base\nyour decision on? Well, despite\nthe lavish promises and vague\nplatitudes which many of the\nmanifestos contain, it is still\nworth winnowing the folly for\nthe grain or two of truth among\nthe chaff, and manifestos,\nreceived intelligently, provide\nthe most accessible impression\nof a candidate's view:..\nThere is also the hustings\nspeech, which is a surprisingly\ngood way of observing a can di date's behaviour under pressure.\nAlthough some candidates are\nobviously better public speakers\nthan others, it's amazing how\ntrue values shine out, despite\nnerves, especially during the\nquestions. If you didn't go to\nyesterday's UG M,I urge you to\nfind some friends who did and to\nask them about what happened.\nAnd many candidates go from\ndoor to door in halls and student\nhouses, directly canvassing for\nvotes. While this can be a real\nnuisance at times it does provide\nthe best opportunity of all to\ngain a first-hand impression of\nwhat the candidate's personality\nis like, to put your own questions\nto them, and to find out what\nthey think of the opposition\u2014\nsomething most candidates dare\nnot say in public!\nFinally a word or two about\nthe voting procedure. This\ncaused a great deal of confusion\nlast year and culminated in\nMarco Ledwold's reversal of aUG M decision. Consequently I have asked Jon Stanley to write\na short article explaining the\nprocedure in detail. This is\nprinted on page 7. Do read it\nbefore you vote.\nI 've gone on at some length; I hope you haven't felt bored or\npatronised but it is so important\nto use your vote wisely. Over the\nlast four years (and perhaps\nmore) there has always been at\nleast one sabbatical who should\nnever have been elected. This\nyear, with so many cuts being\nmade in education, it is more\nimportant than ever to choose\nan Exec who will work hard to\nrepresent our interests. You have\none vote in each of the four\nelections: don't waste it.\nRag Week\nLast week was Rag Week. How\nmany of you knew that? To say\nthat Rag was enthusiastically\nsupported this year would be\nmore than a slight exaggeration.\nAt the Rag and Drag Disco on\nSaturday there were badly a dozen people present; the RCS\nSmoking Concert, which in previous years has packed the\nConcert Hall, attracted about\nsixty people. Other events have\nbeen equally badly supported.\nWhat is the reason for this\nsurge of apathy? Many people\nhave asserted that it is because\nRag Week was held in February,\nrather than November which is\ntraditional, but this reason is\ninvalid. In November many\nstudents ( particularly first\nyears) have not fully settled into\ntheir year of study, and are\nrather apprehensive about\nindulging in stunts which range\nfrom the eccentric to the ridiculous. February is a better time\nfor Rag Week, a fact borne out\nby virtually every other student\nunion in the country.\nNo, the reason IC Rag flopped\nthis year was because of bad\norganisation. There was virtually no publicity (did you see\nanything advertising the Smoking\nConcert?) and people were not\nmade aware of Rag at all.\nNext year there is no need for\nRag Week to revert to November\nfor it to be successful, but it must\nbe better organised.\nImpossible Without\nPeter Hobbis and Jon Smith for\nphotographs, Adrian James for\nnews, Caroline Foers for clubs\nand societies, Diane Love, Melanie Steel, and Shweta Otiv\nfor What's On, Chris Malaband\nfor sport, Pinocchio and Gastropod for their respective columns,\nLee Paddon and Nick Bedding for reviews, J Martin Taylor, LaI a trou, Roland Boerin, Steve Barnett, Jon Barnett, Nick Pyne, Viv Draper\nand Peter Rodgers for pasting\nup, Olivo Miotto whom I forgot\nlast week, Jon Stanley who is the\nonly person who understands\nthe Union Constitution, Tim Noyce for the front page cartoon\nand Maz and Pete the Print.\nMartin S Taylor\nBELOW mixture of amusement and\nresignation the neatly printed\nname of Nicholas F Gardner.\nI wrote of Nick Gardner\nCollege's resident arch-loony,\nlast month when he was trying to\npersuade Wellsoc to invite his\ngirlfriend to lecture on 'The\nHumorous Aspects of Combine\nHarvesting'. Since then he has\nbeen most annoyed at his ban\nfrom College and the Union, to\n.'^.'-'.'JJ.'.'.'-U'1111111'l rrr rrr rrr rrr rrr rrr rrr iii iii ITi ii~i~ ri\"i\"i\"i\" i\"i\"i\" i\"t\" i~i~i \u2122i\"'i\" r_ I_I_I_ I_t j_'_I_'_ IJI_ Ii*i IT\"Ir rc rrr rrr i J_I_I_I_I_I_I_I_I_I_I_I^I_Ij j j\"r rrr ri~ rrr rrr rrr i the extent that he is trying to sue\nStephen Goulder for defamation.\nA letter to the Union from Mr Gardner outlined his intentions\nand, with a marvellous flash of\ninspired lunacy which is the\nhallmark of the genuine eccentric, its author had contrived to\nget the letter stained with blood.\nApart from that letter and\nseveral totally incomprehensible\ntelexes (possibly, but not con-clu siv ely, in French) there has\nbeen no word.

That poverty, unemployment and starvation are not caused solely by\nnatural disaster, but also by oppressive international social and economic\nsystems.\n2. The Brandt Report does not go far enough in tackling the root causes of\npoverty. Brandt sees economic growth generated through trade and aid.\n3.

Home and foreign policies in the T JK could be made to assist in creating\na more favourable climate for development on an international basis.\nICU Believes: \u2022\n1. That for real development to occur, the power of the multinational\ncorporations, which are a formidable economic and political force, must be\ncurbed. All multinationals must be made subject to an international planning\nagreement, opening up their books and inner workings to democratic control.\n2. And is not, and cannot be political. And should be used to support\nprojects, movements and governments committed to ensuring economic and\npolitical power for the poorest.\n3. That the government should denounce aggressive and anti-developmental foreign policy, whilst building positive relations with\ngovernments which eradicate poverty at grass roots level.\n4. Our educational system does not equip us to examine issues of power in\nthe context of North-South relations, nor does it encourage us to examine our\nrole in relation to the structures that cause and perpetuate underdevelopment.\n5. Charity can only alleviate suffering; alone it can never tackle the causes.\nHence the need for a progressive aid programme.\nICU Instructs:\n1. That the WUS project be reinstated, and help be given to organise and\nsupport progressive fundraising events, such as Third World First's AntiPoverty Action campaign.\n2. To write to all local MPs and the Foreign Office, demanding the\nimmediate end to trade, arms SQ s and political recognition of repressive\nregimes.\n3. For a letter to be sent to the Overseas Development Administration, all\nlocal MPs and the Foreign Office, saying:\na) British aid should concentrate on the poorest countries. If it goes\nelsewhere, it must be in ways which directly raise the incomes and economic\npower of the poorest groups.\nb) The government should appoint an independent group of academics\nand voluntary staff with overseas experience to develop practical criteria for\ndirecting aid to the poorest countries. Commercial and diplomatic sector\nconcerns should not distort the distribution of funds.\nc) To create a larger fieldwork network to indent if y and monitor\nprojects staffed by people well acquainted with local needs and interests.\nd) The government should channel more aid without strings attached\nthrough the more progressive voluntary agencies. However, agencies should\nnot be made dependent on government funding.\ne) The Overseas Development Agency should be given more autonomy\nfrom political pressure by taking it out of the foreign office and reinstating its\nindependent status.\nf) The Aid Trade Provision should be abolished as it only benefits private\nindustry.\ng) The Development Education fund should be reinstated.\nVoting Schedule Ammendment\nDelete 14\nProposed by: J.P.

The recent list of priorities in selecting students for places in Halls and\nHouses.\n5. The composition of SRC.\nICU Believes:\n1. That extra places in residence for any category of students must not be\nfound at the expense of any other category.\n2. That the search for and acquisition of Head Tenancies and other\nresidences in the vicinity of College must be a priority for College and ICU.\n3. That ICU and students in general are not fully represented on SRC.\nICU Instructs:\n1. The Exec to inform College of this motion.\n2. The Exec to maintain constant pressure on College in order that the\ntotal number of residences in the vicinity of College is increased.\n3. The Exec and ICU Council to study the composition and effectiveness of\nSRC and other committees that concern residences.\n4. The president to campaign for increased student representation on SRC.\nMotion on Student Loans\nProposer: P Nathan (IC Liberals)\nSeconder: P Riley (supported by the IC Left Alliance)\nICU Notes:\n1. The strong possibility that the present government will include in its\nmanifesto for the next general election, a promise to introduce a system of\nloans for both undergraduates and postgraduates in higher education\n2. That a loans scheme will:\na) saddle undergraduates with debts of more than \u00a33,000 on graduation\nin the case of mixed loans/grant scheme and more than \u00a36,000 if solely a loans scheme.\nb) saddle postgraduates with debts which in many cases could be more\nthan \u00a310,000.\n3. Graduate unemployment is at its highest level since the war.\nICU Believes:\n1. That a loans scheme will:\na) prove a disincentive for students wishing to enter higher education,\nespecially those from poorer homes, and will be another step towards a divided society in which higher education is a preserve of the wealthy.\nb) produce distortions in the range of subjects studied.\nc) lead to increased inefficiencies in the educational institutions, and a further contraction of the higher education sector\nd) serve to limit the contributions that further and higher education can\nmake to society\ne) mean that higher education will become localised.\nICU Instructs:\n1. The officers of ICU to inform all members of ICU as to the facts about\nloans for student as outlined in the above.\n2. The officers of ICU to organise a general letter to MPs outlining the\nabove policy, which all IC students will be able to send to their own MPs.\n3. The students of ICU to publicise the above policy to fellow students,\nparents and anyone else they can think of.\nIC UGM Thursday\nMarch 3rd1.00 pm Great Hall\n\n"

    "content": "Daquise\n20 Thurloe Street\n(Directly at the bottom of Exhibition\nRoad)\nOpen Noon \u2014 11:30pm Set Lunches Noon \u2014 3:00pm Despite my per am bulat ions having taken me\npast this establishment on countless\noccasions, I have never experienced even the\nslightest temptation to take matters any\nfurther than a cursory glance at the menu in\nthe window.\nWhether this antipathy was instinctive or\nwhether it was brought on by the sight of the\ndrab interior so unashamedly exposed to\npublic view, is a wholly uninteresting subject\nfor speculation.\nIREVIEWSI\nNevertheless, responding to the call of duty I finally ventured in, with appetite honed and\nnotebook at the ready. The initial impression\nwas encouraging. A genuine Polish restaurant,\nthe shabbiness punctuated with Polish\nornaments and decorative plates. The\nclientele, without exception, were Polish and\nPolish is clearly the lingua franca here judging\nfrom the conversations at adjacent tables.\nThe empathy provoked by all this ethnic\ncharm survived the starters\u2014Minestrone\n(50p) and Hors D 'Oeuvres (\u00a31.50) which\nconsisted of 'soldiers' of ham, cheese and\nsausage artistically arranged around a heap of\ncoleslaw.\nNothing, however survived the main course.\nNow, I 've eaten Polish food before and\nalthough it is definitely 'different', on previous\noccasions the experience was an enjoyable\none. Not, unfortunately, an epitaph appropriate to Daquise's Polish Bigos (\u00a32.20). This\ndish did nothing to allay my inveterate\nsuspicion that greasy shredded cabbage and\nmashed potatoes are unlikely ever to evoke\ninvoluntary cries of delight and appreciation\nfrom those invited to eat it.\nThe meatballs in the Kasza (\u00a32.60) had an\nunusual flavour, and the peas were actually\nquite nice. However, buckwheat, which\ncovered a large part of the plate must, surely,\nbe an acquired taste\u2014one whose acquisition\nwould require great persistence and a high\ndegree of olfactory anaesthesia. To the\nuninitiated the smell evokes images not of\nPolish (cuisine) but of polish (can of).\nOnly a bottle of Tatra, very strong Polish\nlager (80p) enabled us to survive the\nharrowing main course.\nPartial redemption was achieved by the\n'Continental Patisseries' (35-60p) which were\npalatable though rather dry.\nThe bill for two came to \u00a39.80 (including\nservice) leaving us with enough money for a bag of chips to eat on the way home.\nWilde\nEnthusiasm\nThe Importance of Being Earnest by\nOscar Wilde directed by Peter Hall, the\nLyttelton, National Theatre.\nPerhaps no other play in the English\nlanguage contains so many well known lines as\nThe Importance of Being Earnest. Even the\nbest plays of Shakespeare come lower in the\nlist. The Irish wit and dramatist Oscar Wilde,\nor to give him his full name Oscar Fingal\nO 'Flahertie Wills Wilde, was the leader of a new aesthetic cult s at iris ed in Gilbert and\nSullivan's Patience, where he figures as\nBunthorne. But his piece de resistance, The\nImportance of Being Earnest, sparkles with so\nmuch original wit and philosophical comment\nthat literally every other sentence in the\ndialogue is a clever aphorism eminently\nquotable.\nWhen director Peter Hall read the play three\nyears ago with a view to staging it at the\nNational, he came up against this very\nproblem: it contained almost too many well\nknown sayings for it to be staged with any\nconviction. But, luckily, he changed his mind.\nHall felt that it did have 'a heart', and one that\ncould speak.\nThe play is in three acts, and according to\nWilde, 'the first act is ingenious, the second\nbeautiful and the third abominably clever'. The\nplot is slight but very skilful, but the characters\nare everything. Algernon Moncrieff (Nigel\nHavers) and John Worthing (Martin Jarvis)\nare two bachelors madly desirous of two\nyoung ladies, the Hon Gwendolen Fairfax (Zoe\nWanamaker) and Cecily Cardew (Elizabeth\nGarvie). To the two ladies, only a man whose\nChristian name is Ernest is manageable, and it\nAnna Massey and Judi Dench.\nis this insistence that leads on to humourous\nmisunderstandings and the unfolding of the\nplot. Two other comic characters feature, an\narm-flailing and excitable Rev Canon Chasuble\n(Paul Rogers) and his timid and bashful\nadmirer Miss Prism (Anna Massey). But by far\nthe most dominating character (in the most\nliteral sense) is Lady Bracknell (Judi Dench),\none of the great characters of English\nliterature. Exuding a manly authority and\nstrictness her stern gaze sees love and\nproperty as one and the same. Good breeding,\nbig investments and a bank balance, and\nexternal appearances, to her, make a human a human. Behind all the witty maxims on life, art\nand politics, The Importance of Being Earnest\nlaunches hefty broadsides on the English Upper\nClasses and everything they value.\nThe style of the play is rather like that of\nGilbert and Sullivan. The characters hide their\nemotions by their language, and when their\nemotions are shown, they are hastily covered\nup by a joke. Amongst the philosophy, Oscar\nWilde seems to have a good prod at Germans,\nparticularly Wagner. When Lady Bracknell\nfirst appears, she makes her arrival known by\nan excessively long ring of the o ell, at the end\nof which the occ u pier of the abode sighs 'Oh\nhow Wagnerian!' (On the birth of his first son\nWilde pompously exclaimed, 'The baby is\nwonderful\u2014it has a bridge to its nose!\u2014which\nthe nurse says is a proof of genius! It also has a superb voice\u2014which it freely exercises: its\nstyle is essentially Wagnerian.') The style is\nalso very similar to that of Shaw, a veneer of\nirresponsibility and triviality beneath which\nthere is a profound philosophy where-traditional values are invested and where 'the\nself is paramount, ideas shared by Sartre,\nCamus and Mann and issuing chiefly from the\n'rebel' Nietzsche\u2014a contemporary of Wilde.\nHall's production is blessed by a superb\nchoice of cast. Martin Jarvis and Nigel Havers,\nboth excellent, are just eclipsed by Judi Dench\nand Anna Massey. Between them the\nactresses won five top awards for their parts in\nthe play. The production pays a meticulous\nattention to detail and is so good it's beyond\ncriticism.\nNB: The play finishes at the end of next\nmonth but there is a 'Bargain Night' on\nTuesday March 15 where all seats are \u00a32 \u00a32\npayable on the day.\nNick Bedding\nPagel4l March 4,1983 FELIX\n\n"

It is a huge amount of\nmoney: enough to build over\n500,000 new homes or double\nthe number of hospitals in\nBritain.\nRobert Kelsey\nCiv Eng\nSick Pay\nDear Martin\nJust a quick response to last\nweek's two letters on health\ninsurance. First of all, people in\nhead tenancies and student\nhouses have been charged for the\nsick bay without being told what\nthey are paying for, having no\nmention of it in their tenancy\nagreements and without being\ntold that they are entitled to a refund. As I said in my letter two\nweeks ago, this could well be\nillegal. It certainly isn't right. It\nalso appears that some people\nwho have already payed their\nhealth insurance voluntarily in\nprevious years are now being\ncharged again.\nSecondly Mr Pyne says in his\nletter that '....the UGC has\nspecifically stated such things (ie\nsick bays) should not be funded\nby College'. This is not true! The\nUGC has not said any such\nthing. If the aforesaid gent elm an can point out when, where and\nin which document/com mu nica tion this was put forward, then\nthe College finance section\nwould be glad to hear from him;\nbecause they certainly haven't seen it.\nThe sick bay provides, in the\nwords of Rebecca May (and I agree) '....a vital part of the\nservices offered by the health\ncentre.' It should be kept open\nand the finance withdrawn by\nCollege reinstated. Once we start\naccepting the principle that\nstudents should be paying for\nmedical services, we end up with\nthings like the Lauwerys plan, in\nwhich students will, if the plan is\ncarried out, be paying for Hall\nmaintenance, security guard\nwages and a whole host of other\nthings. The student grant\ncontains no element for medical\ninsurance or the near doubling\nof rents; we cannot afford to\npay!\nYours faithfully\nPhilip B Nathan\nBoycott Bot/Zoo\nPage 41\nDear Martin\nI'm writing to your august\njournal to protest most strongly\nabout the disgusting treatment I received the other day whilst\nattempting to purchase a cup of\ntea in the Biology Common\nRoom. Not only was I pushed,\nbarged, jostled and sworn at as I tried to ask a friend at the front\nof the extremely long queue to\nbuy me the lifesaving liquid, but\nI was also encountered by a group of angry life scientists as I walked away, who demanded in\nhighly vociferous terms just\nwhat the hell I was doing in their\ncommon room, anyway.\nI feel that the time has come\nfor action. Of late coffee breaks\nhave become increasingly uncomfortable due to the large\nnumbers of these people assembling in the Biology Common\nRoom. It's not a very nice place\nanyway, and I feel that students\nlike myself who are not life\nscientists should show their\ndisapproval of such practices by\nboycotting the Biology Common\nRoom as of today, and using the\nfacilities in our own depart-ment s. Yours sincerely\nAK Waner\nPhysics\u2014\nA copy of this letter has been\nsent to the Life Sciences Divisional Representative.\nTea'd Off\nDear Sir\nWe would like to bring to\nyour attention a festering sore of\ndiscontent, a veritable puss-body\nnot ten yards from your office.\nWe talk of the streaming of\nhordes of a parasitic variety of\nstudent (mostly maths, physics\nand chem eng types, with a note able super-variety of assorted hacks) to the Bot/Zoo\nCommon Room at tea and\ncoffee breaks.\nMany Life students and staff\nhave been unable to obtain tea\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 March and coffee there as a result of the\naforementioned dregs of society\nhaving scoffed the lot. or by\nforce of numbers prevented\nentry to the common room. Bot\nZoo incidentally stands for\nBotany and Zoology, as does\nChem Eng stand for Chemical\nEngineering.\nThis has led to much ill-feeling\nwhy not only the other day five\nphysicists were killed by a maniacal student with a Yorkshire bill book. and others are\ntaking up kung fu and carrying\nshot guns. Full scale riot would\nseem to be no more than a petrol\nbomb away.\nPerhaps it should be made\nclear that the Bot Zoo tea service\nis run and sub sidi sed by the Life\nSci division for use by its\nstudents and staff. How would\nthese social misfits like it if we\nwent round disturbing their tea\nmachines (or what ever they\nhave). The more scientific\namongst us have pointed out\nthat there is only one way to find\nout. Let's be reasonable before it\nreally gets silly.\nYours\nGeoff Evans\nPeter Burt\nA copy will be sent to AK Waner, Physics 2\nCloud's Defence\nDear Sir\nI am writing in response to\nyour article and two letters\nconcerning Morning Cloud.\nThe recent copy of Morning\nCloud was produced with the\nobjective of being humourous. It\ndid not attempt to present well-debated political points. It\ncertainly did not hope to imply\nthat the Conservative Society's membership is of a low calibre,\nwhich it is not. The review\npurposely offered satire rather\nthan argument and consequently\nsome may h considered it\nrather 'undergraduate'.\nThe other political societies\nand ourselves have always\nproduced serious publicity in the\npast. Most students, rightly or\nwrongly, have little time for this\nsort or prop a can d'i. This edition\nof Morning Cloud offered an\nunusual one-off experiment. It\nhas certainly attracted attention\nand I hope succeeded in its aim\nof providing amusement. To\nthose it has offended greatly, I apologise, and hope you look\nforward to the next serious\nedition of Morning Cloud.\nYours faithfully\nJohn Pattison\nConservative Society Chairman\nStanding Down\nDear Sir\nUnfortunately I have had to\nwithdraw my candidature for\n1CU President this year. The\nreason for this is solely because\n1 have been appointed assistant\nmanager of the Fremantle Hotel\nduring the summer vacation.\n1 apologise to all those who\nseconded me and to all those\nwho were going to vote for me\n(\u2014if any).\n1 wish the rest of the candidates luck (except Phil Nathan).\nYours sincerely\nJ FO Ranger\nPS: Watch out for r.ox t year!\nNew Religion?\n'You never see animals going\nthrough the a osu rd and often\nhorrible fooleries of magic and\nreligion'\u2014Aldous Huxley\nDear Editor\nFor various reasons religion\nhas been subjected to an immense amount of criticism yet, it\nremains true that the great world\ncivilisations were only able to\ngrow into maturity because of\nspiritual dire cuon and religious\nbeliefs. Without an effective\nreligion guiding the spirits of the\npeople there could be no growth\nof civilisation, no novelty, no\nnew beauty, no rie v joy.\nAs a Baha'i,I be ii eve that the\nhuman race stands little chance\nin the future unless we build a new world civilisation. This new\nworld civilisation can only be\ninspired by an upsurge of\nspiritual knowledge which can\nonly be maintained through\nreligion.\nBut what kind of religion? A religion which will unite man\nkind, allowing for the diverse\nreligions, cultural and social\nbackgrounds fo the people,\nremove the causes of hatred and\nstrife, and be in harmony with\nscience and reason to become a constructive power in fulfilling\nthe requirements of man in this\nday and age.\nThere is no need for a religion\nwhich has lost its essential truths\nand has been polluted by man's limited ideas to become merely a practice of rituals, dogma and\nfanaticism and be the cause of\nbloodshed and war.\n'If religion becomes a cause of\ndislike, hatred, and division, it\nwere better to be without it...\nAny religion which is not a cause\nof love and unity is no religion.'\nFrom the Baha'i Writings\nYours sincerely\nRoger Kingdon\nSec of the Baha'i Society\n4,19831 I FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "ENI&M A Last but not least we come to the best of a poor bunch in Enigma, Cert 15, directed by\nJeannot Szwarc, now showing ABC Fulham\nRoad and Warner West End. A classic spy\nthriller of the old school, set in that happy\nhunting ground of postwar thrillers: East\nBerlin. It has been modernised; the agent is\nbeing sent in to steal a vital piece of\nmicroelectronics and upon the outcome of his\nmission rest the lives of five Soviet dissidents\nwhom the KGB have decided they can do\nwithout, but essentially it's the good old\nformula, recognisable in various forms from\nWheatley to Le Carre; double crossing, border\nsearches, people being severely beaten up,\nothers gagged and stuffed into broom\ncupboards, while the hero borrows their\nclothes to make good his escape. Usual stuff,\nlove it or hate it, it's purely a matter of taste.\nThere are no dramatic special effects;\nmercifully we are spared yet another car chase\nand some of the twists and turns try hard to be\noriginal. But what can you do with a genre and\na format like this? You can get silly and have\nthe enemy agent as an android from outer\nspace bent on galactic domination for no\nreadily apparent reason, or you could throw in\na spot of supernatural jigger y poker y, but,\naiming for an audience with at least a little\npadding between the ears, you're basically\n^REVIEWS\nstuck with it.\nEnigma is a good spy film which you will\nenjoy if you like spy films but haven't seen\nevery spy film from the 1950s on. I didn't feel it\ngenerated any feeling of suspense and thrill;\nour hero, Alex Holbeck is a really nice guy who\ndoesn't kill anyone and is so idealistic as to be\nsaintly.

We\nare all hoping that this amazing\nsense of organisational competence remains with our illustrious captain for this weekend's Bisley trip.\nIn the handicap rifle to urna ment. Mark Bourke pulled out\ntwo perfect scores against all the\nodds, beating Gary Smith who is\nagain eliminated\u2014will he never\nsucceed? Mark, the organiser of\nthe tournament, now meets\nAndrew Hamilton in the final.\nAndrew had previously quashed\nthe resistance offered by, Tim\nHiggs, who joins Gary Smith as\na semi-final drop-out.\nNoel Lindsay, who enjoys\n. having his feet tickled by buxom\nyoung ladies, did absolutely\nnothing of any importance this\nweek, but it is said that he is to\ngive his demonstration at the\n'electric sleeping bag in modern\nsociety' in the near future.\nDon't forget that the week-end's Bisley trip leaves the\nSportscentre at about 9:15am. If\nyou want to go, but haven't been\nselected, please turn up anyway\nas there may be one or two spare\nspaces.\nLast weekend saw the annual\n' competition for the 'Castaways\n\u2022 Cup' the Inter-London three\nboat team racing trophy. None\nLondon college and hospital\nteams (inc two from IC) and one\ninvited team from City University were entered for this, the\nmost prestigious event of the UL\nSailing calendar.\nA brief glance at the form card\nshowed that competition was to\nbe tough, with no less than seven\nof the fifteen man squad, chosen\nby the British Universities\nSailing Association in their\npenultimate selection of a seven\nman team to visit America,\nsitting at the blunt end of boats.\nOn Saturday sailing was in\ntwo leagues, all sail all twice.\nICII were struggling, but despite\nbeing beaten by a combined\nmedical school team and QMC,\nthe two winners of the league,\nthey put up a good fight and\nraced well.\nICI in the other league were\nbeaten by City, a dark horse, but\nwent through to the semi-final\nbeing second in the league.\nOn Sunday ICI were drawn\nagainst QMC in the semi-final. It\nmight have been a Wednesday\nafternoon practice as six ICI\nhelms chased each other round\n'The Harp' in some skilful team\nracing. However ICI lost both\nraces and so left the competition.\nQMC ultimately beat City in the\nfinal and so broke seven years of\nIC domination of the com pet i tion.\nICII beat UC in the final of\nthe 'Castaways Plate' (Wooden\nSpoon) competition.\nThanks are due to Castaways\nfor excellent courses and for\ntheir skill in contriving perfect\nconditions wind and weather\nwise, we had long believed the\nrace officer to be a deity but this\nsurely proves it!

Led by club\ncaptain Madeleine Spottiswoode, who won all three of her\nbouts, and ably seconded by\nKathy Hollinshead and Di\nHeppel, the ladies swept to\nvictory by 6-3.\nLiu Huang fenced well in his\nfirst match for the novice foil\nteam but IC was beaten overall\n6-3. The fiercely contested mens\nfoil ended in an 8-8 draw with\nnewcomer Simon Brock doing\nwell to win two bouts against the\nexperienced Kings team. The\nother team members Tony\nAmbery, Peter Baines and\nveteran Harvey Bird were just\nnot able to find consistent form.\nIn the sabre and e pee events\nIC fought hard, in some cases to\nthe point of total exhaustion, but\nwere beaten in both 6-3. Harvey\nM9KBMHBHMK9 \u2022 March\nBird's two victories in ep ce bouts\nprovided some relief from total\ngloom. It must be pointed out\nthat because of the club's shortage of experienced fencers,\nseveral members already mentioned plus Graham Burt loot,\ncompeted in more than one\nevent.\nFirsts\nGutteridge Plate\nIC vs Barts 12-6\nIC started this final very strong-ly, finding themselves in their\nopponents 25 for most of the\nfirst half. However the only\nscore they managed in this\nperiod of pressure was a penalty\nby Steve Philips.\nSt Barts came back strongly in\nthe second half and IC's defence\nproved stout enough after\nletting through an easy try. Steve\nPhilips then kicked another\npenalty late in the second half to\ntie the score at 6 all. Half an\nhour of extra time was then\nplayed, in which the IC pack\ndominated again. Steve Thompson crashed through three\ntackles to score near the posts\nand from on IC never lost their\ngrip on the game.\nTries: S Thompson, S PHilips\n(1 con, 2 pen).\nTeam: M Thompson, P Hardoe, S Thompson, P Clarke, P Eastland, S Philips, S Johns, J Davies, D McGee, W King, A Ralph, C Henderson, P Richards,\nC de Rohan, J Whittle.\nSeconds\nIC vs RFC 3-0\nThe team once again relied on\nunknowing volunteers to enable\nthem to stumble onto that\nhallowed battle field at Harlington. The opposition graciously\ndonated us a player so that they\ndidn't actually have to face the\nfearsome Phil Huge\u2014something\nor other\u2014he refereed instead\nand amazingly no one commented on his eyesight.\nMatch report? What can you\nsay? Fourteen blindfolded, one-legged lunatics would have\nmoved less randomly and more\nconstructively.

Monsewer Jump\nscored one excellent goal.\nRegrettably, expert goal minding by the opposition resulted in a51 defeat. At the end of the match\nthe captain (Jim) was quick to\narrive at the bar (quicker than\nthe left win aer anyway), such\nleadership! He got quickly\npissed,nearly forgot his coat and\nonly just caught the coach back.\nThe following day Jim returned\nto Harlington to play football\nand brutally kneed the opp osi tion's goalkeeper in the head\nWith characteristic calmness.\n\u00ab HH HH HMMM FELIX "

    "content": "Election Rumpus\nA serious complaint has been\nmade about the publicity used by\none of the candidates in the\nsabbatical elections. Lee Paddon,\nwho is standing for the post of\nFELIX Editor, has accused\nPallab Ghosh, the only other\ncandidate, of exceeding the\npermitted level of spending.\nMr Ghosh had his election\nposters and hand-outs printed\nby Mistral Print, a London firm\nwhich receives the majority of\nthe Union's external printing\ncontracts. He is claiming that\nhe was charged \u00a320 for the work,\nthus keeping the total cost of his\ncampaign below the \u00a345 allowed\nby the Elections Committee. He\nsaid that Mistral Print had\noffered a large discount because\nof their connection with FELIX, and their friendship with Mr\nGhosh. Mr Paddon, he said,\ncould also have had his posters\nproduced by Mistral if he had\nwanted to.\nMr Paddon has pointed out\nthe cost of publicity similar to\nMr Ghosh's would normally be\nover \u00a385. He told FELIX he was\nunaware of the possibility of a discount available to IC Election\ncandidates, and believes that Mr Ghosh has used his position to\ngive an unfair advantage.\n\"the Elections Committee has\nnot yet reached a decision on the\ncomplaint, but expects to do so\nsometime today. The Returning\nOfficer has requested FELIX not to disclose further details\nuntil after the elections for fear\nthat it will prejudice the results.\nDarbishire Winner\nThe election for next year'sR CSU executive was ratified on\nTuesday. The successful candidates were Eric Darbishire as\nPresident, Dave W Parry as\nVice-President and Susan Humphrey as Honorary Secretary.\nAlthough the election was\nin quo rate \u2014only 274 votes were\ncast by an electorate of 1,800\u2014it\nwas ratified without opposition\nat Tuesday's RCS Union General Meeting. Other officers for\nnext year are Elisabeth Parfitt,\nwho will be Academic Affairs\nOfficer, and Mark Gillet, the\nHonorary Junior Treasurer.\nFlour Power\nAbout thirty students from Queen\nMary College carried out a raid\non the Union Building yesterday\nafternoon.\nShortly after the Hustings\nU GM, the students ran into the\nBeit Quad throwing eggs, flour\nand cans of burning creosote.\nThey then attacked the Union\nOffice on the first floor, but staff\nand several Union members held\nthem off, and little damage was\ndone inside the office other than\na smoke bomb being let off\nwhich filled the East staircase\nwith dense orange smoke.\nThe raid, which was in retaliation for the violation of the\nQM C mascot, taken almost\nexactly a year ago, is believed to\nbe a part of their Rag Week.\nQM C students' Union is expected to receive a formal\ncomplaint that their raid was not\nin the spirit of inter-collegiate\nmascot ry, and a cleaning bill\nfrom IC. Aerosoc's paper aeroplane competition was held from the roof of Beit\nQuad last Thursday. Photo: Jonathan Smith\nHeath Slams Leaders over World Problems\nThe failure to solve many of the\nworld's economic and social\nproblems over the last decade is\ndue to a paralysis of world\nleadership, according to former\nPrime Minister Edward Heath.\nHe contrasted the present\nsituation with the imaginative\nleadership of post-war years\nwhen the present international\ninstitutions such as the United\nNations, the IMF and the World\nBank were established, and the\nMarshall plan helped to rebuild\nEurope with American assist-ance.\nMr Heath, addressing a meeting organised by the Conservative Society, spoke of the\nresulting thirty years of peace\nand prosperity with the success\nof detente and the transformation from war to peace time\neconomies. But since the early\nseventies these old institutions\nhad inevitably become outdated,\nand their structure and operation is in urgent need of reform.\nWithout new qualities of leader-FELIX H HaH HH HI ship to bring this about he\npredicts a bleak outlook for\nthe\nrest of this century.\nIn his speech, which was\nenthusiastically received by the\nlarge audience, Mr Heath outlined the history of international collaboration since the\nwar and relations between East\nand West. He was strongly in\nfavour of negotiated disarmament and deterrence, but feels\nthat more imaginative leadership is needed to bring about\nnew agreements. But he also\nbelieves that negotiations are the\nonly way forward and that\nagreement is possible given the\npressures on both sides.\nTurning to the problems of\nthe underdeveloped world, he\nsaid that with large amounts of\nunused manufacturing capacity\nin the industrialised countries it\nshould be possibly to supply the\npoor count i res of the world with\nthe products they need but\ncannot afford to buy. He mentioned the dangers of import\ncontrol to protect our old labour-intensive industries such\nas textiles because these are the\ntype of industry the Third World\ndepends on. There is a great\nneed to create the right economic conditions for this transfer of\nwealth based on mutual self\ninterest: the developed world\n.would have higher output and\nemployment and the underdeveloped countries would receive the goods and services\nthey desperately need. The world\nmonetary system, devised in\ntwenty-two days after war, is\nin a state of disarray, ..e said.\nBut at the recent summit o! world leaders nothing had been\ndecided about reforming the\nsystem.\nHe defended the pre s eni government, saying that although they had not initially\naccepted the findings of the\nBrandt Report they have now\nhad a change of heart, and that\nthey have done a partial U turn\non their overseas students\npolicy. It is he said, essential Tor\nthe West to provide the leadership to take the world out of its\npresent crisis, or else underdeveloped countries will be\ndriven into the arms of Moscow\nor Peking resulting in political\nand military interference in their\ninternal affairs.\nMarch 4,19831 \u2022 \u2022 B Page 3\n\n"

    "content": "Candidates\nfor the post of PRESIDENT of IC\nUnion\nChris\nBOYD\nproposed by Bruce Bricknell\nImperial College is unique in that it has four\nunions, three CCUs and the ICU. In the past\nthe IC Union has always tried to cater for the\ngeneral needs of the student ie ac com moda tion, food, clubs, etc, leaving the equally\nimportant job of introducing the student to the\nsocial life of the college to the CCUs. It would\nappear that at present there is a strong body of\nopinion among IC Union hacks that the CCUs\nhave too much power and their grants should\nbe cut at the expense of bar nights and other\nsocial events. I personally think this would be\nthe biggest mistake so far by this incompetent\nbunch of egotistical wan kers. The social life\nwithin the college would die, and the healthy\nrivalry between the CCUs would cease to exist.\nIn my opinion the IC Union has spent so much\ntime bickering about trivial crap that they are\nfailing to do the job they are there for, screwing\nthe college for every penny wt can get to\nimprove the students standard of living.\nConcerning the recent upsurge in the belief\nthat we should rejoin NUS, 1 feel that far from\nNUS becoming less involved in party politics, a small band of influential students are trying to\nmake the IC Union more involved in party\npolitics. Societies in the Union such as CND,\nConsoc, Soc Soc. etc. can easily cater for the\nneeds of politically minded students and\nshould be financed in accordance to their size\nof membership, thus leaving the Union\nExecutive to deal with the problems that the\nstudents face and not those of the whole\nworld. \u201e. . D, Chris Boyd\nCarl\nBURGESS\nproposed by La Iatrou\nStrong Stand on Video Games\nThe pinball and video games are of the greatest\nimportance to most students. I feel that there\nshould be many more available for the\nvoracious appetites of the IC student and that\nthe present ones should be kept in a better state\nof repair.\nStrong Sit On Woolly Toilet Seat Covers\nDue to exe ess sitting down on the hard seats of\nthe lecture theatres, many students have\ncomplained about the soreness of their rears\nwhen using the toilets. I myself have suffer red from sores when sliding back and forth on the\ntoilet seats, attempting to read the graffitti. The\nonly answer to this is woolly toilet seat covers.\nArmchairs for Lecture Theatres\nI am of the opinion that all students should be\nafforded the opportunity to sleep in comfort\nduring lectures, as it is very uncomfortable on\nthe hard seats and there is hardly any leg room\nfor slouching and discreet unavoidable acts.\nPurchase of Alarm Clocks for Union Officers\nAll union personnel should enjoy the facility of\nbeing work en up, by force if necessary, for the\nrunning of the union.\nFree Alcohol at UGMs\nThis is to increase the participation of the\ngeneral body of students in UGMs, otherwise\nthere will be more for those who turn up and I doubt whether quorum will be called.\nCarl Burgess did not submit a photograph with his manifesto.\nGaynor LEWIS\nproposed by Ian Bull\nThe Candidate\nI am proposing Gaynor for President because I feel that the union as a whole could only\nbenefit from her. Throughout her career at IC,\nGaynor has been involved in the union in\nsocial, academic and administrative positions\n\u2014from Mines VP to MRE Dep Rep.\nFurthermore, her keenness, efficiency,\nability to get on with people and clear-headed\nthinking; combined with a refusal to be college\n'- door-mat will ensure that the union will no\ni longer stagnate, but at last move forward.\n\u2022 , , Ian Bull\nThe Job\n\" During my time at IC. I have been involved in\ni most aspects of student life. I feel this interest\nand commitment will enable me to do the job\nof President to the best of my ability.\n. The Issues\nResidence: Although the Lauwerys Report is a Page81 I March 4,19831\nwell prepared and researched document,\ncertain recommendations are detrimental to\nstudents at IC, eg removal of college subsidy\non residence\u2014resulting in a large rent increase.\nFurther discussion is vital before any\nrecommendations are implemented.\nThe issues of refectories revives every\nyear\u2014with little ever being achieved! The\nsituation has to improve! The problems of\nresidence are now being discussed\u2014I would\nlike to see a report, similar to the Lauwerys\nreport, published on catering facilities at\ncollege: then, some reasonable recommendations and action could be undertaken.\nRejoining the NUS would Cost IC a minimum of \u00a34,000. I personally feel this\nmoney could be better spent elsewhere!\nHowever the choice is yours! IF the student\nbody elects to re-affiliate itself with\nNUS....then IC would do so.\nJoining the Universities Athletics Union will\nenable sportsmen and women at IC to play\nagainst a far higher standard of opposition, as\nwell as ensure the representation of IC as a self-sufficient sporting college\u2014nun er than under\nthe guise of ULU.\nGaynor Lewis\n\u2022 \u2022 aHH HH HH HH H FELiX "

    "content": "with nukes and conventional\nweapons. The nukes are pointed\nat the soft underbelly of the\nUSSR while the hardware will be\nused to 'stabilise' the Gulf and\nIran.\nLast but not least, the country\nwas bled white by 'import-substituting industries' (for this\nread multi-national investments\nin low-tech screwdriver plant\nassembling imported components for a highly protected home\nmarket) which collapsed in 1979\nunder the weight of \u00a320b foreign\ndebts. The IMF doctors moved\nin with the familiar dose of\n'monetarist' austerity packages.\nThe cure was worse than the\ndisease as unemployment rose to\naround 20%, real wages halved\nand the entire burden of paying\noff the debts dumped on ordinary working people. Hence no\nhuman rights, no unions, no\npolitical parties. Keep your nose\ndown and work....or else.\nAs each section of society\ncame under the tender mercies\nand tutelage of the all-wise, all-seeing and benign generals (the\ntop one ran for President in\nNovember, and yes, you guessed\nit right, he was the only candidate and yes he received 91.8%\nof the votes) the universities\nwere also 'reformed', with the\nfinesse and concern one has\ncome to expect from military\ngentlemen of a certain per sua sion.\nThe Turkish military regime is\ntrying to transform schoolrooms\nand lecture halls into surrogate\"\nmilitary barracks. It has introduced strict new requirements\nfor nationalist indoctrination in\nhigh schools, has ended university autonomy, replaced\nelected university officers with\nappointed ones and has set up\nthe High Education Council\n(from whence the British Council sponsored pair of doctors\nhave emanated) to mould the\ncountry' s intellectual and academic life according to its\nown image.\nThe entire educational apparatus is now controlled by the\nHead of State who nominates\nthe principal of the High Education Council ( HE C, spelt\nYO K in Turkish). The Council\nhas purged most rectors and\ndeans of faculty (Dr Tezel's rise\nto his current position at MET U is not entirely unconnected with\nthe purge of his former col-leagues), introduced national\ncurriculum guidelines, has\nreorganised the academic career\nstructure and has redefined the\nstatus and teaching duties of all\nacademic staff. As the Times\nHigher Education Supplement\nheadline declares: 'Politics off\nthe agenda as fear and confusion\nreign' (11/2/83). All this was\naccomplished by military fiat\nwhich excluded consultation,\ndiscussion and debate.\nThis assault on the country's academic establishment was\ncompounded by show trials\ndesigned to intimidate and\npunish leading intellectuals. As\nwidely reported in the Western\nEuropean press, the arrest and\nimprisonment of the executive\ncommittee of Turkey's first and\nonly peace association fitted in\nwith this orchestrated terror\ncampaign. The Turkish Peace\nAssociation executive, who were\nreleased on bail just before\nChristmas but sill face thirty\nyear sentences, included a vice-chancellor, two professors and\nfour lecturers. Of the latter, Dr\nHaluk Tosun, received his PhD\nfrom Imperial College in 1974\nor 1975 and was head of the\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering at MET U prior to his\nimprisonment. Like all arrested\nacademics, he has since lost his\njob. (For more information on\nthe TP A trial see END Special\nReport TURKEY: PEACE ON TRIAL available from European Nuclear Disarmament,\n227, Seven Sisters Road, London\nN4, 90p).. As with the peace\nmovement the executive of the\nTurkish Writers' Union are also\nbeing tried by a military tribunal\nheld under 'war time conditions'.\nAll in all, martial laws courts\nhave called for 4,000 death\npenalties.\nThis then is the real story\nbehind Doctors Tezel and\nGuruz's double-act around the\ncampus circuit in this country.\nThe name of Imperial College is\nat the top of their hit-list. British\nacademics who are being approached to work in Turkey\nshould surely have the same\nqualms as when they are approached by burly gentlemen\nwith South African accents. We\ncan reel off a list of names which\ncan read like the Who's Who of\nrepression and torture in the\nworld: Gal tier i, Pinochet, Stroessner, Duarte and so forth.\nBut the thing about Turkey is\nthat it is a part of Europe. If the\nnukes refused by the rest of\nEurope find their way into the\nUS bases in Turkey then it really\nmatters who runs this outpost of\nNATO and how. Look at the\nhavoc caused by Galtieri amongst\nthe sheep and penguins and then\nthink of the distance between\nLondon and Istanbul.

Here Jon\nStanley explains the system.\nA single transferable vote system\n(STV) is used in the sabbatical\nelections, and in most other ICU elections. This article describes\nhow STV operates and how to\nvote using STV.\nSTV enables electors to place\ncandidates in an order of\npreference. If their first preference candidate is unsuccessful\ntheir vote is transferred to their\nsecond preference. If their\nsecond vote is unsuccessful their\nvote is transferred to their third\npreference, and so on,\nAt each stage the candidate\nwith the lowest number of votes\nis eliminated and his votes are\nreallocated according to next\npreferences. A candidate is\nelected once he has more votes\nthan all the remaining candidates put together.\nIt is also possible to use STV\nin a multiple-seat election.\nVoting is done in exactly the\nsame way but a more complicated counting procedure is\nnecessary to reallocate votes\nreceived in excess of the number\nrequired to be elected (called the\n'quota').\nThe procedure for voting in\nthe ICU sabbatical elections on\nMonday and Tuesday, March 7\nand 8 is straightforward and will\nnow be described.\nThe first requirement is your\nUnioncard. You will not be\ngiven voting papers unless you\n| remember to bring it with you.\nVoting is done in the same\nway for all four elections. To\nvote for the candidate of your\nfirst preference you must place\nthe figure 1 opposite the can di date's name. Ticks or crosses\nwill not be counted. (Despite this\nwarning, it seems, some voters\ninsist on putting crosses on the\nvoting paper and wasting their\nvote.)\nIf you wish, you can show a second preference by placing the\nfigure 2 against that candidate's name, a third preference by\nwriting the figure 3 against your\nthird preference and so on, up\nthe number of candidates in the\nelection.\nFigure 1 gives some examples\nof valid votes and figure 2 shows\nsome invalid voting papers.\n1\nIf it happens that none of the\ncandidates are particularly popular there is a chance that an\nelection will be rerun in the\nsummer term. You may want\nthis to happen in the hope that a new candidate will emerge and\nbe elected, someone so popular\nthat large numbers of people feel\ncompelled to vote despite other\npressing concerns like exams.\nFollowing the decision taken :it\nyesterday'sU GM,a sabbatical\nelection can no longer be\ndeclared in quo rate. Apart from\nreruns because of irregularities\nin the election procedure, the\nelections for President, Deputy\nPresident and Honorary Secretary can only be rerun if the\nnumber of deliberate abstentions\nexceeds the number of votes cast\nfor the candidates. Because of a quirk in the rules, this does not\napply to the FELIX Editor, and\nthis election can only be rer in because of irregularities in\nprocedure.\nIt follows that for the election\nof President, Deputy President\nand. Honorary Secretary, if you\nwant to try to get the election\nrerun (possibly because you feel\nthat none of the candidates is\nsuitable) you should mark your\nvoting paper with the word\n'Abstain'.
