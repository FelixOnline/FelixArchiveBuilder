    "content": "Get out is a social horror movie about racism. The\nplot is simple: Chris is a Black man nervous at the\nidea of meeting the family of his white middle-class\ngirlfriend, Rose. While her parents seem to be sup-portive, something feels off. Undoubtedly, the viewers\nwill share with Chris this feeling of uneasiness that will\nslowly turn into straight-up horror.\nOne thing that differentiates \u2018Get out\u2019 from other\nmovies of the horror genre is that it focuses on depicting casual racism. The white people of this film never\nhate on the black people (on the contrary!) but they\nvauntChrisasatrophy,completelydehumanizinghim.\nFor instance, the family acknowledges Chris\u2019 physical\ntraits such as being athletically fit and like to remind\nhim that they \u00ab would have voted for Obama for a\nthird term if [they] could. Best president in [their]\nlifetime, hands down \u00bb. The whole movie is sprinkled\nwith similar remarks and creates a fantastic build-up\nfor what\u2019s coming next \u2013 the actual horror.\nAs the director Jordan Peele said, \u201cPart of being\nblack in this country, and I presume being any minor-ity, is constantly being told that... we\u2019re seeing racism\nwhere there just isn\u2019t racism.\u201d\nIn terms of filmmaking, \u2018Get out\u2019 is quite good. The\noppressing atmosphere is rendered through some well-thought scene compositions. In terms of the music, the\nmain theme \u00ab Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga \u00bb evokes mysteries and secrets. Finally, the movie is full of symbolism\nthat I won\u2019t talk about here to avoid any spoilers but\nif you are interested there are lots of articles online. I\nstrongly advise you to not get spoiled before you watch\nit.\nWant some interesting facts about this movie? It was\nshot in only 23 days. It was made for just $4.5 million\nand earned more than $255 million worldwide. It is\nthe first film by Jordan Peele and with it he became the\nfirst Black screenwriter to win an Academy Award for\nBest Original Screenplay.\nIf you don\u2019t know what to watch for spooky Halloween and Black history month, do consider \u2018Get out\u2019!\nGet Out\nHalloween Film Recommendations\nGrave (Raw)\nThis French body horror movie is definitely not\nfor everyone. It is a little gory, rather graphic and\npretty disturbing, as some scenes can be hard on the\nstomach. In fact, a couple of people passed out during\nits screening in Toronto.\nWhat is \u2018Grave\u2019 about? Justine, a vegetarian, joins a\nveterinary school and is forced during her ragging to\neat raw meat. The consequences are as unexpected for\nJustine as for the viewers. I won\u2019t say much more of the\nscenario because I think it is better to just let the movie\ntake you wherever it wants.\nYou might be wondering, why is it interesting to\nwatch? The story is unusual, the cast are talented and\nthe filmmaking creates a creepy atmosphere. Particular\nattention has been brought to the colours and the light\nused. Moreover, the main theme by Jim Williams suits\nthe movie perfectly. However it is not perfect as some\nscenes can seem to be unnecessary or/and just there to\nshock the viewers. But it is still definitely worth watching if you are interested in horror films.\nAnotherinterestingpointthatdeservestobebrought\nto light is that it is the first film by Julia Ducournau\nand its lead actress, Garance Marillier. Julia Ducournau\nwon Palme d\u2019Or prize at the Cannes Film Festival this\nyear (2021) with her second movie: \u2018Titane\u2019. She is the\nsecond woman to ever win the festival, the first one being Jane Campion with \u2018The piano\u2019 in 1993.\nNext time someone says that France only makes\ncomedies, don\u2019t forget about bloody \u2018Raw\u2019!\nDirectedby: Jordan Peele\nStarring: Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams,\nCatherine Keener, Bradley Whitford\nDirectedby: Julia Ducournau\nStarring: Garance Marillier, Ella Rumpf, Rabah\nNait Oufella\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEdited by: Eva Borras\nFilm\nFilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n22\nAur\u00e9lia Bordes Film Writer\nWhat\u2019s on?\nICU Cinema\nshowing of \u2018The Rocky Horror Picture\nShow\u2019: Monday 1st November at 7pm in the\nUnion Concert Hall.\nThe \u2018Rocky Horror Picture Show\u2019 is no ordinary\nmovie. The 1975 classic has amassed a cult\nfollowing with its catchy tunes, fantastic humour and\nits breath-taking but never too disturbing weirdness.\nBehind all the madness there is a plot to this\nmovie: a young couple (played by Susan Sarandon\nand Bill Bostwick) stumble upon a creepy old house\nfull of alien revellers from the planet Transylvania,\njust in time for the grand unveiling of Dr Frank-NFurter\u2019s (Tim Curry\u2019s) newest creation: Rocky Horror.\nThis creation represents the epitome as an ultimate,\nseductive sex symbol. As the film progresses the young\nsweethearts slowly embrace the unbounded sensuality\nand fascination with absolute pleasure.\nWith a stunning soundtrack including \u201cThe Time\nWarp\u201d, it\u2019s a real booty-shaker of the cinematic world.\nIfthisclassichasacertainplaceinyourheartorifyou\nhaven\u2019t had the pleasure of watching it, ICU Cinema\nis showing it on Monday 1st November in the Union\nConcert Hall. Doors open at 18:50, ads and trailers at\n19:00 with the title feature starting at 19:20.\nTickets can be bought on the door for \u00a35 CASH,\nand we have a selection of drinks and snacks. Bonus! If\nyou come in costume, you get \u00a31 off your ticket price!\nIt\u2019s sure to be a hell of an evening and if you\u2019re a\nfan of either the film or wearing something a little bit\nspecial for one evening, you\u2019ll love this.\nRebecca Vickery ICU Cinema Chair\n\n"

Transparency in the workings\nof the College and the work of\nyour student representatives is key.\nTherefore I, the Felix Editor, on\nbehalf of the team, promise that:\nWe will, to the best of our\nability, tell you the whole truth\nand nothing but the truth.\nWe will keep your confidence\nand will only publish something\nyou say to us if you have\nexplicitly said that we can.\nWewillworktoexposeunfairness\nand discrimination in all forms\nthat it takes at the College.\nWe will treat fairly any article\nsent to us, regardless of point of\nview,anddoourbesttoworkwith\nyou to prepare it for publication.\nSignedbySamLovatt\nEditor-in-Chief\nWhen Boris Johnson was elected in\n2019, I seem to have made a mistake\nin assuming that this would be a small\n\u2018c\u2019 conservative government. I don\u2019t\nthink I\u2019m in the minority here - it\nwould be hard to assume\nanythingdifferentonthe\nbasis of the austerity\nunder Cameron\nand Osborne. Not\nto mention that\nconservatism is\nfundamentally a low-tax, small government\nbelief system and these\nare some of the most\ncardinal ideals that traditional voters\nwill have had in mind when voting\nfor the Tories. For better or for\nworse, we are incredibly far from that\nworld in October 2021. This week\u2019s\nAutumn budget further cemented\nthe strange, chimeric leadership style\nseen so far by Boris\u2019 government.\nSome of it will have gone down\nwell with traditional voters: cuts\nto business rates in the hospitality\nand leisure industries; alcohol and\nfuel duty were cut to ease the rising\ncost of living (although weirdly,\nshort-haul flight duty was also cut -an interesting bone to throw three\ndays before the most significant\nclimate change summit in history).\nThen there\u2019s some big state\nannouncements that I imagine\nwent down like cold sick with some\nolder backbenchers and probably\nbegrudgingly well with those more\ncentrist and left: more spending on\nhealthandpublictransport,improving\nuniversal credit, increased National\nLiving Wage by a whopping 6.6%, and\nextending airport financial support\nfor another six months. All\nthis comes after an increase\nto National Insurance\ncontributions and\nconsideration of proppig\nup big energy suppliers\ndue to increased energy\nprices that they could, and\nentirely did, see coming,\nas prices have been rising\nsince January. Whitehall\nwill in total spend an extra \u00a3150\nbillion over the course of the current\nParliament, which makes the total so\nbig it outstrips even the huge tax take.\nOf course it\u2019s still all presented as\nif the government is as Tory as they\ncome - self-proclaimed Thatcherite\nSunak shouting \u201cGROWTH. UP.\nJOBS UP\u201d at Parliament saw to\nthat, and as Labour put it \u201cbankers\non short-haul flights sipping\nChampagne will be cheering\u201d.\nTax levels will now be the highest\nthey have been since Clement Attlee\u2019s\npremiership, who, let\u2019s not forget,\nused the high level of capital to\nestablish the NHS. Meanwhile our\nbeer will be about 3p cheaper per pint.\nI should be clear, I don\u2019t necessarily\nlike or dislike these decisions,\nI just think it\u2019s pretty weird.\nThe Autumn Budget\nThe Comment Section\nAs you may see if you make it that\nfar through the paper, we have quite\na spicy Comment section this week.\nFurther to the notice in the section,\nI would like to reiterate that the\nopinions in that section DO NOT\nreflect the view of Felix - in fact the\nonly section that does is the Editorial.\nPart of the paper\u2019s role in the\nstudent community is to provide\na platform for debate - we have a\nmonopoly on undergraduate student\nvoice, so taking any agenda too\nstrongly, even informally, would stifle\nthose in the community that disagree\nwithus.Wealsostandstronglyforfree\nspeech (see overleaf for more on that).\nI expect a strong response to\nComment this week and I would\nthoroughly encourage anyone who\nfeels a certain way about any piece\nto write a response that we will\ninclude in next week\u2019s issue. There is\ngenuinely no benefit in just getting\nangry about a piece, and if you put\nhow you feel into words you might\ndo good and change some minds.\n\n"

    "content": "As you enter Whitechapel Gallery, a sense of calm\nwashes over you \u2013 it\u2019s small, intimate. Exactly the\nplace you would like to spend a relaxing afternoon in.\nOnly Yoko Ono\u2019s MEND PIECE for London doesn\u2019t\nquite live up to the task.\nThe exhibition is organised in the hallway of the first\nfloor, awkwardly nestled between two actual gallery\nrooms. Visitors are instructed to take a seat at one of\nthe tables and:\n\t\t Mend carefully.\n\t\t Think of mending the world\n\t\t at the same time.\nOn the pristine white tabletop, various objects jostle\nfor space: broken fragments of ceramic cups and plates,\nscissors, tape, glue, and twine. The setting seems oddly\nclinical, not least because you constantly feel like you\nare being watched. A gallery employee tasked with ensuring safe handling of the materials stands ominously\nat the edge of the room. Visitors passing through the\nhallway glance thoughtfully at the exhibit: \u2018Is this some\nsort of performative art piece? Are we meant to watch\nyou mend these objects?\u2019 Not quite.\nThe experience improves after more people join the\ntable. Although nobody speaks, there is a mutual understanding that this is a time for meditation. The ceramic fragments don\u2019t seem to fit together, as visitors\nsoon discover the purpose is not to reconstruct a coffee\ncup, but rather to reinvent, to make art. I found myself\nabsolutely absorbed by the piece of twine my fingers\nwere mindlessly wrapping around a cup handle. At first\na simple (if not childish) concept, MEND PIECE becomes mesmerising, profound, an escape from daily\nlife and a chance to just \u2018be\u2019 \u2014 even for only half an\nhour.\nYoko Ono\u2019s piece is inspired by the Japanese art of\nkintsugi: repairing broken pottery with a mix of lacquer and precious metals such as silver or gold. Philosophically, it views breakages and repairs as part of\nan object\u2019s history. Scars are not defects; they carry\nmeaning and tell a story. Beautiful as this message may\nbe, I believe MEND PIECE does a mediocre job of expressing it. The mended objects displayed on shelves in\nthe same hallway are less \u201cbroken plate turned into art\u201d,\nmore \u201cceramic clutter tied with string\u201d. Ono wants you\nto think of mending the world, but at best you get a\nbrief chance to mend yourself \u2014 your tired brain, or\nperhaps your broken heart. And hey, it\u2019s cheaper than\ntherapy.\nArts and crafts for grown-ups\nReviewed by Ioana Esanu Arts Writer\nYoko Ono:\nMEND PIECE for London\nWhere? Whitechapel Gallery\nWhen?

I feel like I\u2019m clubbing but crouched with\nmy iPad. Nearby, someone\u2019s tapping their drumsticks\nagainst a not-drum surface, someone\u2019s playing an\nunplugged electric guitar, and someone needs to\nstop handling live aux cords. It\u2019s still definitely a step\nahead of standing under the Edison bulbs in the bar\nfor about an hour and a half, talking to musicians\nabout their niche tastes \u2013 \u201cwhat\u2019s Sungazer, sorry?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s electro-jazz.\u201d A friend looks at me and clarifies,\n\u201cbeep-boop jazz\u201d. I nod, knowingly.\nRandom Band Night is an annual event held by\nLive Music Society, inviting musicians from across\nImperial to prepare and perform a song with a\nrandomly allocated band in an hour. As a talentless\nreporter, my instrument is my iPad, which I hold\nwith a superiority complex over the guitar cases that\npeek overhead in this crowd. So before I pass critique,\nI\u2019d like to inform you that the only experience I had\nlearning an instrument was a rather slow, resentful\njourney to Grade 5 on piano.\nThe first band begins to play \u2018Last Night\u2019 by the\nStrokes as the musicians take their time returning to\nMetric, setting a standard for the rest of the night\nthat is surprisingly hard to surpass for the remaining\nbands. Most are limited by their poor vocalists who\nstruggle to maintain the rhythm of the song despite\nbeing held up by genuinely compelling drummers. A\nfairly static audience (of mainly just other musicians\nwaiting to perform) watches these vocalists become\nmore confident reading lyrics off Google in a deadpan\nvoice, making me feel like I\u2019m at an unnecessarily\nelaborate karaoke session.\nThe instrumentalists on the other hand, are taking\na different turn. Band 11 is a \u201cput-them-togetherand-see-what-happens\u201d concoction of a vihuela\nplayer, classical guitarist, drummer and saxophonist.\nTheir rendition of \u2018Fly Me to the Moon\u2019 is a much-needed change of pace and the most noteworthy\nperformance of the night. Band 5\u2019s \u2018Californication\u2019\ncontains a much-applauded electric guitar solo, Band\n10\u2019s \u2018505\u2019 by the Arctic Monkeys (which I\u2019m biased\ntowards) has a phenomenal guitarist, and a number\nof performances make me turn to my friend and gape\nfor a moment.\nTowards the end of the night, the thinning\naudience begins to take an active interest in the music\nand it feels more like a micro-concert \u2013 a post-credit\nscene to the more or less subdued night. Band 13\u2019s\nperformance of \u2018Holiday\u2019 by Green Day features,\nat the least, an enthusiastic vocalist supplemented\nby a small group of people that know the song well\nenough to fill in Billie Joe Armstrong\u2019s missing shouts\nat exactly the right time. Band 14\u2019s cover of \u2018Smell\u2019s\nLike Teen Spirit\u2019, meanwhile, introduces a 10-person\nmosh pit (which is just as dangerous for a person my\nheight as a regular-sized one). My favourite - a two-guitar performance of Bob Dylan\u2019s \u2018All Along the\nWatchtower\u2019 - punctuates the metal that was saved for\nthe end.\nRandom Band Night isn\u2019t meant to be a show of\ntalent as much as just a fun celebration of rock classics\neveryone knows. It\u2019s easy to forget these performances\nhad an hour of preparation and are honestly just a\ngreat way to interact with other musicians.\nSo, to all the musicians who had the guts\nto perform and stayed to enjoy the\nmusic, I hope to see you again in\nMetric.\nEdited by: Rosie Millns\n& Tara Pal Chaudhuri\n\n"

In September of 2020, Royal\nBotanical Gardens Kew estimated that\n39.4% of plants are threatened with\nextinction, which is double that of the\n2016 estimate of 20%. Artificial intelligence technology improved our assessments of plant distribution and risk,\nrevealing how dire the situation is. To\nput these numbers into context, there\nare more threatened plant species than\nall described vertebrates combined. This\nestimate came at the end of the 16-year\nGlobal Strategy for Plant\nConservation\u2019s goals,\na programme from the\nConvention on Biological Diversity, which had\noutlined goals for plant\nconservation to be met\nby last year. Although the\ngoals were missed, there\nwas significant progress\nmade towards the assessment and understanding\nof plant extinction rates.\nPlants have the potential to mitigate climate\nchange through carbon sequestration,\nand hold a host of potential medicines,\nfood, and biofuels. Globally, around 4\nbillion people rely on herbal medicines\nas their primary source of healthcare,\nand 13% of the 5,411 assessed medicinal\nplants are under threat. We also rely on a\npainfully small number of edible plants:\nof the 7,039 edible plants assessed, only\n5.9% of them are major food crops, 15\nplants provide 90% of humanity\u2019s food,\nand 4 billion people rely entirely on rice,\nmaize and wheat. This reliance leaves us\nvery vulnerable to climate change and\nmalnutrition. It is now a race against\ntime to find, name and describe plant\nspecies before they go extinct, and we\nare rapidly losing our potential bunch\nof useful species. \u201cEvery time we lose a\nspecies, we lose an opportunity for humankind,\u201d said Professor Alexandre Antonella, Director of Science at Kew.\nSo what has been done in the last year\nto help? Unfortunately, there is no easy\nor blanket solution to plant conserva-tion. Practical solutions can include\nprotecting biodiverse areas and reconnecting segmented land, but it is important to understand the particular needs\nof species and areas. The report recommended we rapidly increase our risk as-sessments. Global assessments currently\nonly assess around 30% of plant species,\nand we cannot protect species we don\u2019t\nknow about. Thankfully, our methods of\nspatial and temporal plant assessments\nare improving, as the report demonstrat-ed, but they need\nto be done quicker so we can apply\npractical solutions\nwhich will greatly\ndiffer area-to-area\nand plant-to-plant.\nSome areas even\nexperience greater diversification\nunder a warming\nclimate, but others\nare devastated by\nthe impacts of climate change.

With over 260,000 deaths reported annually by the World Health\nOrganization(WHO)andtheincreasingtrendofmalariacasesinAfrica,the\nneed for a vaccine is urgent. Changing\nthe course of public health history is\nRTS,S/AS01(RTS,S),thefirstmalaria\nvaccine in the world providing partial\nprotection in young children. Originally created in 1987 and developed by\nBritish pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), RTS,S was finally\napproved on October 6th by\nthe WHO for children from\nfive months of age. The efficacy this vaccine demonstrates\nagainst malaria holds the\npotential to be game-chang-ing for public health.\n\u201cThis is a historic moment.\nThe long-awaited malaria vaccine for children is a breakthrough for science, child\nhealth and malaria control,\u201d\nsaid WHO Director General, Dr Tedros Adhanom\nGhebreyesus. \u201cIt is a gift to\nthe world [\u2026] Its value will\nbe felt most in Africa because that is where the burden of malaria is greatest.\u201d\nWHAT IS MALARIA\nAND HOW DOES\nIT SPREAD?\nMalaria is an ancient dis-ease, and these parasites have\nlikely been around for 30 million years, causing 150\u2013300\nmillion deaths in the 20th century alone. In humans, malaria\ncan be caused by five different\nspecies of Plasmodium parasites, transmitted through the bite of blood-suck-ing Anopheles female mosquitoes. Following a bite, infected mosquitoes will\ninject malarial parasites known as sporo-zoites. These sporozoites travel from the\nskin and multiply in liver cells, where\nthey mature into merozoites, the next\nstage in their life cycle. This leads to liver cell destruction, following which the\nmerozoites will escape into the bloodstream to invade red blood cells. Individuals with severe malaria may experience abnormal bleeding, convulsions,\nrespiratory distress, and liver failure,\ncarrying a 90% risk of death if untreated.\nHOW DOES RTS,S WORK?\nThe RTS,S vaccine targets the most\ncommon and deadly malaria parasite in\nAfrica, Plasmodium falciparum, which\naccounts for 99.7% of estimated cases.\nWhereas COVID-19 vaccines (e.g. Pfizer and Moderna) use mRNA technol-ogy, RTS,S is a subunit vaccine which\ncontains purified pieces of the pathogen.\nMore specifically, RTS,S uses the hepatitis B surface antigen as a vaccine platform to display a specific malaria protein\non its surface. Similarly to the spike protein targeted by COVID-19 vaccines,\nRTS,S, targets circumsporozoite protein (CSP), a protein secreted by the\nmalaria parasite during the sporozoite\nstage. CSP is then recognized by our\nimmune system, triggering a response\nagainst the parasite in its early stages,\nbefore it can infect the cells of the liver.\nAccording to the WHO, RTS,S is\nsafe, highly cost-effective, feasible to\ndeliver, and has no negative impact on\nother malaria prevention measures.\n\u201cFor centuries, malaria has stalked\nsub-Saharan Africa, causing immense\npersonal suffering,\u201d said WHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti. RTS,S \u201coffers a glimmer of\nhope for the continent which shoulders the heaviest burden of the disease\u201d.\nWHY HAS DEVELOPING\nTHIS VACCINE\nTAKEN SO LONG?\nThe complex reproductive\ncycle of malaria, across both\nhumans and mosquitoes,\ncombined with the invasion\nand destruction of both red\nblood cells and liver cells, has\ndelayed the development of a\nsuccessfulvaccineagainstma-laria. \u201cIn the last 15\u201320 years\n[\u2026] we have already had an\nincredible success in terms of\nreducing malaria incidence,\u201d\nsaid Professor Jake Baum,\nco-director of the Institute\nof Infection at Imperial, during an interview for Felix.\n\u201cMost of it has come from\nbed nets, but also access to\nbetter drugs and other public health policies.\u201d However,\nthis reduction has plateaued in the last few years with\nthe emergence of insecticide\nand drug resistance. \u201cI think\nwhat that shows you is that\nif you only use the best drugs\nthat you have in your arma-mentarium, then you can only\nget to a certain point in reduction,\u201d said Professor Baum.\nLorena Mejias Martinez Science Writer\nThe malaria vaccine:\nEdited by: Isabelle Zhang\nJamie John\nCara Burke\nMarek Cottingham\nScience\nCould malaria become the second disease ever to be eradicated?\nMalaria parasite transmission cycle:(1) Transmission of the malaria parasite (in its sporozoite form) into the human blood\n-stream when a mosquito bites a human; (2) Sporozoites travel via bloodstream, infect hepatocyte cells of the liver and repli\n-cate; (3) Liver cells erupt, releasing merozoites that invade the red blood cells and replicate; (4) Red blood cells erupt, releasing\nmore merozoites that invade red blood cells and replicate; (5) Some merozoites develop into gametocytes; (6) Transmission of\ngametocytes into mosquitos when they bite an infected human; (7) The gametocytes mature into gametes in the mosquito gut\nand fertilisation of the gametes occur for sexual reproduction of the parasite; (8) The ookinete (from fertilisation) migrates to\nthe mosquito gut wall and implants; (9)The ookinete forms an oocyst, in which thousands of sporozoites will form; (10) The\noocyst bursts to release sporozoites into the salivary glands of the mosquito\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nSporozoite\nMerozoite\nGametes\nOokinete\nOocyst\nMosquito\nMosquito\ngut wall\nRed blood\ncell\nGametocytes\nLiver cell\nIllustration credit: Nicolas Geiseler\nToran (Mechanical Engineering,\nImperial College London)\nOn \u201cLenna\u201d\nThe Playboy centrefold which came\nto be known as \u2018Tech\u2019s Original Sin\u2019 8\npage\nUninfected mosquito\nInside a\nhuman\n\n"

I\u2019ve watched sets on my own before,\nlosing my friends in the crowd and spending the night\npreoccupied with trying to find them, but also having\nthe reassurance that I would have somebody to travel\nhome with afterwards. I have travelled to gigs on my\nown before too, lying to my parents about going to a\nfriend\u2019s home but instead meeting people I vaguely\nknew via Twitter music circles in London to see a band\ntogether in a venue we were too young to get into (I\nknow my dad reads this \u2013 sorry dad). But knowing I\nwas consciously going alone to a gig terrified me.\nI spent the entire day in my pyjamas, counting down\nthe minutes and feeling sick at the idea that in exactly 3\nhours and 57 minutes I would have to stand in a room\nof 149 strangers alone, my face buried in my phone\nbetween sets, clutching a strong drink both for my\nnerves and for something to do with my hands.\nItisnotlikeIdislikegoingplacesalone.Ienjoygoing\nto cafes alone, or museums alone, or exploring new\nplaces alone. I am not sure why a gig felt so different.\nPerhaps it is the thought of standing out in a room\nof strangers, all of them being\ntrendy people seeing a trendy\nband with their trendy friends.\nIt is not a matter of\nunfamiliarity. The venue is\none I feel at ease in. I go there\nregularly \u2013 in fact, on the day\nI saw Peeping Drexels, I had\nalready been there earlier in\nthe week, and had a gig booked\nthere later in the week too. The\nanxiety was not from fear of\nthe unknown. I can trace the\nway there in my head. I don\u2019t need to do a search to\nknow that I should get the 109 from Brixton station to\nCroydon, stopping at Blenheim Gardens and walking\n5 minutes down the road before reaching the familiar\ndoors of The Windmill, hearing the familiar bounce of\nthe tennis ball on the street from Roof Dog, who lives\nupstairs and peeks at gig-goers over the roof, dropping\nhis ball down onto the street to encourage people to\nthrow it up and get stuck in a game of catch with him.\nIt is also not a matter of safety. The Windmill is\nthe type of venue where I feel comfortable to put my\nbag down at a random bench at the back of the venue\nwhilstIgointothecrowd,trustingthepeoplewhovisit\nthere enough that I know it won\u2019t be stolen before I get\nback. I feel safe there, even as a 5\u201d2 woman on my own.\nTravelling to and from the venue alone wasn\u2019t the root\nofmyanxietyeither.IliveinadifferentpartofLondon\nto many of my friends, so I am used to travelling to and\nfrom places alone. If I am comfortable being alone in\nsomanysituations,whydidlivemusicfeelsodifferent?\nI tried my best to time my arrival exactly for when\nthe band was on, but I managed to arrive just as the\nsupport was finishing, meaning I was anticipating the\nentirety of the 30-minute set break to be awkwardly\nstandingalone,myphonenothavingenoughserviceto\nmindlesslyscrollsocialmediatoseembusyandpassthe\ntime,andbuyingenoughdrinkstotaketheedgeoffthe\nanxiety but not enough to get drunk and be vulnerable\non my own. I was anticipating\nfeeling self-conscious, paranoid\ntheentiregigthatthe100people\nbehind me were burning their\neyes into the back of my head,\njudging me for not being able to\nfind an acquaintance to take my\nspare ticket.\nI might have just gotten lucky\nwith the crowd for my first solo\ngig trip. By chance, I bumped\nintopeopleIhadmetatafriend\u2019s\nband\u2019s show the previous week. I\ndidn\u2019t spend the night with them, but having a friendly\nface at the back of the room comforted me a lot. It\nended up being my favourite gig that week, better than\nthe other ones I had been to with friends.\nGoing to social spaces alone feels like a celebration\nof freedom. I did not have to worry about how my\nfriends were experiencing it - if they were enjoying it or\nnot, if I was going to lose them in the crowd, or if the\nacquaintance I vaguely knew and gave a spare ticket to\nwas judging my dancing. I could slip in and out of the\ncrowd as much as I wanted, snaking my way through\nto the front without annoying the people around me\nwhen I wanted, and entering the moshpit whenever I\nwanted. I was free to speak to the band after the set\nwithout hounding them (though unfortunately I\ncouldn\u2019t get a clear answer about what a Drexel was).\nIn fact, once the set started, I probably felt less self-conscious than I normally do at live music events, and\nthe music was better for it.\nPeeping Drexels were insane. The crowd was\nenergetic, but not violent; attendees shouted the\nwords along loudly, but didn\u2019t speak over the music\nthroughouttheset.ItwasthelasttimePeepingDrexels\nwere playing their EP Bad Time, and I would have\nregretted it so much if I had missed it.\nIn a study of 500 18\u201324-year-olds, 65% have been\nto a gig alone, and 98% would be happy to do it again.\nI understand why. The experience was empowering, if\nnot infectious. I think it has kickstarted a journey of\nnot being afraid being alone and of learning to love\nmy own company and indulge in my interests without\nbeing inhibited by the availability or interests of my\nfriends.\nI think I prefer going to gigs alone.\nLive Music is Better Alone\nWritten by Rosie Millns Music Editor\n\u201c\nIN A STUDY OF 500\n18-24-YEAR-OLDS,\n65% HAVE BEEN TO A\nGIG ALONE, AND 98%\nWOULD BE HAPPY\nTO DO IT AGAIN\nOpinion\nway that I grew up, I was made to feel that vulnerability\nwas a shameful feeling, as a man especially, and so I just\nthink I unconsciously covered those feelings up with\nlanguage that wasn\u2019t accessible\u201d. This emotional truth\nshows itself in a devastating and cathartic way in \u2018Say\nWhat You Will\u2019, possibly one of the best tracks on the\nalbum.\nYet I find myself missing the edgier, moodier vibes of\nRetrogradeandeventhesofterpoeticauraofTheColour\nIn Anything, an album that felt like an electronic ode to\nnature. This new release appears to be an extension of\nAssume Form. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Blake\nhas matured past the abstracted dubstep of his earlier\nreleases, but this maturity comes across, perhaps, as a\nsanitisation in response to his rise to fame. My biggest\ndisappointment was with the title track. I usually have\nno problem with stripped-down vocals and a piano (if\nthat is also your thing, I recommend his LP, Covers).\nHowever,thisballadseemssooutofplaceandcomplete\nbreak from his usual style.\nThematically, is one of the strongest Blake has\never released.

Or picked up a plastic stirrer\nto stir some sugar into a coffee, then\nthrown that out? Or grabbed a pack\nof plastic cups from the supermarket\nto be used for a single party, and had\nthem all thrown out too? Easy, isn\u2019t it?\nWell, those individual single-uses of\nplastic utensils contribute to our collective global 300 million tonnes of plastic\nwaste every year, and that number isn\u2019t\nshrinking. This plastic waste ends up in\nlandfills, not only taking\nup much-needed space,\nbut also in woodland,\nrivers, oceans, etc., and\nhas harmful effects on\nthe natural world. Most\nof us already know this;\nthese facts and statistics\ncould almost be considered common knowl-edge. Regardless, it\u2019s not\neasy to change habits\n\u2013 even those only developed in the last 50 years\nor so. The extent of many\nindividuals\u2019 attempt at\npositive environmental\nchange is simply to buy\na set of metal straws.\nIn the last few years, following the\nrise in awareness surrounding climate\nchangeandrelatedenvironmentalissues,\nmany businesses have taken initiative towards reducing their plastic waste. Large\ncorporations have made small modifications to the way they function on a\nconsumer level, examples being McDonald\u2019s removing their plastic straw dispensers and H&M taking in old clothing to \u2018reuse and recycle\u2019 in exchange\nfor clothes vouchers. These acts look\ngood on the surface, but don\u2019t actually\ncontribute much in the grand scheme\nof things. Plastic straws and packaging\nstill litter landfills, and fast fashion prevails throughout the fashion industry.\nThe pandemic has also had a detrimental effect on the environment.\nWhile CO\u00ad\n2\nemissions fell by a small\namount due to the lack of travel, our\nglobal plastic consumption rose, mainly in the form of PPE, food take-out\ncontainers and cutlery, and packaging\nfrom online shopping deliveries. The\npercentage of recyclable and recycled\nplastics being used have also dropped,\nand economic rebound around the\nworld will likely involve increased carbon emissions, increased fossil fuel\nconsumption, and higher rates of pollution than before the pandemic began.\nThe UK government has recently proposed a nation-wide\nban on a number of\nsingle-use plastics in\ncutlery, packaging,\nand other items, as\nwell as a \u00a3200 tax on\neach ton of plastic\npackaging produced\ncontaining less than\n30% recycled materi-al. This follows their\n10p charge on plastic\ncarrierbags,whichdid\nsignificantly reduce\nsales of single-use carrier bags around the\ncountry. Blanket bans\nand taxes essentially\nforce corporations to\nlook for alternatives, such as reverting\nback to paper and glass packaging, or investing in biodegradable plastics, while\nmaintaining their position against com-petitors.Thiscouldbeconvenienttiming\ngiven that most businesses are being remodeled post-pandemic. Unfortunately,\nthe packaging tax only comes into effect\nin April 2022, and the single-use plastic\nbanhasyettobeapprovedbyParliament.\nSome may argue that this move is\nmuchtoolittle,toolate,andtheUKgov-ernment lags behind the EU, who have\nimplemented their single-use plastic restrictions from July of this year. The official EU website states: \u2018single-use plastic plates, cutlery, straws, balloon sticks,\nand cotton buds cannot be placed on the\nmarketsoftheEUMemberStates.Inad-dition, the same measure applies to cups,\nfood and beverage containers made of\nexpanded polystyrene, and all products made of oxo-degradable plastic.\u2019\nInourcurrenteconomy,itis,ofcourse,\na tall order to eliminate ALL single-use\nplastics, but those products that can\nfeasibly utilise environmentally friendly\nalternatives should do so. Any institutional move towards a greener economy\nand improving eco-friendliness is surely\na welcome one. However, the problem\nis not the action itself, but the failure to\nproceedwithitsoonerandfailuretotake\nfurtheractionintacklingclimatechange.\nAnother substantial source of plastic\npackaging is supermarkets, which sell\nenormous amounts of consumables that\nneedtobekeptfreshandprotectedfrom\nbacteria and viruses (particularly during\nCOVID).Theseplasticsaren\u2019ttechnically single-use \u2013 they\u2019re used as storage for\nextended periods of time \u2013 so they won\u2019t\nbe included in the ban, but they still\ncontribute significantly to plastic waste.\nIt is difficult for supermarkets to control\nthis, due to products being sourced from\na variety of suppliers. While some have\nmade efforts to improve eco-friendliness\n(e.g., using cardboard instead of plas-tic), the majority of food packaging gets\ntrashed anyway, especially since recycling requires the materials to be clean.\nSupermarket corporations might\ndo well to consider reverting back to\na more \u2018old-fashioned\u2019 system where\nthey can, in which customers collect\nsupplies from large dispensers, using\ntheir own containers. Zero-waste stores\nhave adopted this on a small scale for\nproducts such as shampoo, seeds and\nnuts, and pasta. However, these stores\ntend to be much more expensive than\nyour average Tesco or Sainsbury\u2019s, and\nhave limited options in comparison.\nWhile these policies will have economic impacts on the food & beverage\nand hospitality industries, won\u2019t the environmental benefits outweigh the cost?\nTheymayrequireustostartbuyingmore\nreusable utensils and containers to carry\naround, but the amount of energy and\nresourcesthatgointomakingthoseonce\nwill be minute compared to the amount\nused to producing single-use packaging over and over again, and they will\nbe much less polluting in the long run.\nScientific studies will tell us that\nwe\u2019re past the point of no return, that\nnothing an individual person does\ncan make a difference, but why should\nthat stop us reducing, reusing, and re-cycling? Until governments and corporations start making better choices and moving towards significant\nchange, all we can do is try to make as\nmany eco-friendly choices as possible.\nOne Use, Five Hundred Years\nin a Landfill\nZannaBuckland\nBooksEditor\nOn the government\u2019s proposal to combat plastic waste, and why they need to do more.\nTHE PROBLEM\nIS NOT THE\nACTION\nITSELF, BUT\nTHE FAILURE\nTO PROCEED\nWITH IT\nSOONER\n\u201c\nAn aerial view of a landThll site in South Tangerang, Indonesia.\nPhoto credits: Tom Fisk on Pexels\n\n"

This\narticle is a sincere attempt to ascertain\nthe issues with regards to \u201cModern Day\nFeminism\u201d. If you somehow end up reading this article to the end, just make sure\nyou try to understand the points I am\ntrying to document in this article rather than reading it to respond to a few\npoints which might not fit with your\nline of thinking.\nI believe the modern day narrative of\nfeminism is pretty skewed. With the ev-er-increasing influence of social media,\npeople (mostly girls) are being misled\ninto perceiving that feminism is a concept wherein women are supposed to be\nsuperior to men. But the entirety of this\nconcept in the contemporary world revolves around the fact that these \u201cSocial\nMedia Warriors\u201d are willing to address\nonly those issues which are under the\numbrella of their comfort zone.\nWhenpeople(withmoreemphasison\nfeminists)talkaboutstandingupagainst\ninjustice, it is majorly biased towards issues affecting women. When they talk\nabout injustice, feminists\nusually turn a blind eye to\nthe sufferings of men. The\ndefinition of feminism\ntalks about equality of the\nsexes,whichshouldalsoin-cluderaisingawarenessand\nvoicing your opinion about\nthe problems that men deal\nwith. Unfortunately how-ever, that is not something\nI see quite often. If you\u2019re\nstill glued to this article, let\nme tell you that at no point\nam I generalizing. There\nare always anomalies. That\nis what we Chemical Engineers like to call it.\nAnother point that I\nhave noticed feminists tend to bring up\nis the existence of a patriarchy (a system\nof male-dominated society). But is our\nsociety actually male-dominated? The\nreverberating answer that I might get\nis that an enormous amount of wealth\nis possessed by men and that ladies do\nmore unpaid work. But when they propose this contention, they to some degree fall flat to get that what they\u2019re talking about may be an exceptionally tiny\npopulace of men.\nOn the flip side, gravely antagonistic\nindividuals are men. Most individuals\nwithin prisons are men. Most people\nwho die in wars are men. Most people\nwho are destitute are men.\nMost individuals who\ncommit suicide are men.\nHow often do we see feminists stand up for the\nhardships of men? What\nwomen rights activists are\ndoing these days is that\nthey\u2019re considering an awfully small substratum of\nextremely successful men\nand using them to speak\nabout the entire structure.\nEven if we were to say that\nwe have a patriarchal structure (to some degree or ex-tent) the fundamental basis of that structure is not\ndominance, it\u2019s the result\nof proficiency.\nEgalitarianism is a principle that revolves around the notion that all people\nare equal. There have been a few countries that have tried to become egali-tarian. For example, the Scandinavian\ncountries have moved towards an extraordinary bargain of sex uniformity,\nbut scientific data shows the identity\ncontrasts have expanded instead of de-creased. For example, the proportion\nof women who are opting for STEM\nfields (Science, Technology, Engineering\nand Mathematics) has decreased rather\nthan increased. Why is this something\nthat no feminist talks about?\nLastly, I would like to shower light\nupon a vital issue that comes up during feminist discourse - rape. Rape is a\nheinous crime and if proven guilty, the\nperson should be hanged to death. But\non the other hand, addressing issues\nlike fraudulent or false rape accusations\nis equally as important. The other day I\nwas watching a TEDx talk by Deepika\nBhardwaj titled, \u2018Men - the forgotten\ngender\u2019. I was taken aback when she asserted a statistic put out by the Delhi\nCommission of Women which says that\nof the rape cases filed between April\n2013 and July 2014 in Delhi (also informally known as the \u2018Rape Capital of\nIndia\u2019), a whopping 53% cases were false.\nHow does one justify this?\nI will abstain from saying anything\nfurther. I would like you to take a moment and ponder over the points that I\nhave brought to the table rather than being outraged against points which \u201cyou\u201d\nfelt were absurd.\nThe argument that the concept of\nmodern day feminism is genuine and\nmoving on the right path is utterly fal-lacious. While the flip side of it, which\napparently our minds can\u2019t reconcile, is\nsomething we need to ponder upon.\nIs feminism meeting its definition? Writer Srigan Moharir argues that modern day feminism is failing to do so.\nSriganMoharir\nWriter\nHOW\nOFTEN DO\nWE SEE\nFEMINISTS\nSTAND UP\nFOR THE\nHARDSHIPS\nOF MEN?\n\u201c\nSigns at a Women\u2019s March in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia 2019.\nPhoto credits: Michelle Ding on Unsplash\nIs Modern Day\nFeminism Flawed?\nFelix strongly stresses that the views put forward in this\nsection, and in all sections other than the Editorial, do not\nreflect the views of the paper.

Her distinctive\naesthetic and style have gained her a lot of avid fans,\nbuthavealsoledtoprofoundlytoxicbodyshamingand\nrather annoying criticisms of her opus that all too often\nlie in either a disdain of her \u201c13-year-old girl fanbase\u201d\nor her being an industry plant or what not. When it\ncomes to doing productive music criticism, however,\nwe should always aim to focus on one thing only \u2013 the\nmusic \u2013 and do our best to distance ourselves from\nany prevalent lines of discourse that are there to take\nuncharitable stabs at the artist. And\nthe fact is, in my opinion at least, that\nBillie and Finneas are a remarkably\ninnovative duo in the sphere of\npop, constantly venturing into new\nterritories and experimenting with\nsound, far more than most other\nrenownedpopfiguresatthemoment.\nWHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP,\nWHERE DO WE GO? is one of the\nbolder and more exciting records of\n2020, both lyrically and production-wise, which left me at the edge of my seat for this new\nrecord to drop. As the songs from Happier Than Ever\nwere released, however, I found it hard to capture the\noverall vibe of the album, which left me in a state of\nconfusion, but also curiosity.\nThefirstsingle,\u2018YourPower\u2019,isaveryeeriedepiction\nof abuse and manipulation within the music industry,\nbut sonically, I found the acoustic guitar to be a bit\nmonotonous and forgettable. I felt much the same\nabout \u2018my future\u2019, which has already evaporated from\nmy memory. The next two singles to drop, however,\nvery much blew me away. \u2018Therefore I Am\u2019 is all that\nyou want from a good Billie track \u2013 a punchy, dirty\nbeat, with Billie\u2019s dark, intimate, in-your-face vocals\ntelling her body shamers to fuck off (\u201cI\u2019m not your\nfriend\u201d, \u201cStop / What the hell are you talking about?\n/ Get my pretty name out of your mouth\u2026\u201d), while\nDescartes\u2019 \u201cI think therefore I am\u201d adds to the potency\nof that \u201cfuck you\u201d (albeit not saying anything much\nmore profound than that).\nIncontrasttotherecognisableBillievibeofthistrack,\n\u2018Lost Cause\u2019 gives us something completely different \u2013\nawonderful,soulishsoundcompletelyuncharacteristic\nto the duo so far. The album keeps doing this, shuttling\nbackandforthbetweenthetypicaldarkandedgyBillie\nsound,andthisnewmellow,vintageaesthetic.Although\nthe duo succeeds remarkably well at times at creating a\npretty and lush vibe on these more adventurous tracks\n(and it does so best with \u2018Lost Cause\u2019,\nin my opinion), these jumps do feel\nawkward at times when it comes to\nthe flow of the album and, within the\ntracks themselves, it often seems like\nthey are struggling a bit at navigating\nthis new territory. \u2018Halley\u2019s Comet\u2019,\nfor instance, is a wonderful tune that\nconveys the confining feeling of fame\nreally well (with her getting a break\nfrom it all about as rarely as Halley\u2019s\nComet passes\nby Earth \u2013 i.e. twice in a lifetime),\nbut as the track progresses it\nabruptly changes in tone which\nkind of disrupts the immersion,\nmaking it feel incomplete. In\ncontrast, \u2018NDA\u2019, which deals\nwith similar struggles and Billie\nhaving to make her lovers sign a\nnon-disclosure agreement before\nthey leave, has some of the best\nproduction I\u2019ve heard this year,\ncomplemented remarkably well\nwith Billie\u2019s elegantly autotuned\nvocals and the incredibly\nchoreographed, anxiety-inducing\nmusic video where Billie is\nwalking down a highway amidst\nspeeding cars. Without trying to be relatable in any\nway (which Billie\u2019s lifestyle for sure isn\u2019t to most of us)\nor suggesting this to be some universal experience, the\nsong simply opens up a window into Billie\u2019s psyche,\nusing the non-disclosure agreement as a tool to convey\nhow absurdly claustrophobic her life has become.\nAnother brilliant example of this overarching theme\nis the opener, \u2018Getting older\u2019, which is an intensely sad\nandintrospectivepieceonhowfamehasinfluencedher\nand,insomeways,drainedher(\u201cThingsIonceenjoyed\njust keep me employed now\u201d). The beat is very bare\nand intimate, but the simplicity does not stop this tune\nfrombeingamongmyalbumfavourites.Thenofcourse,\nthere is the continued theme of body shaming which is\nvery explicitly addressed in the monologue piece \u2018Not\nMy Responsibility\u2019, followed by \u2018OverHeated\u2019, which\ndepicts a concrete paparazzi incident that initiated\na stream of online abuse.

    "content": "For the first time in over a year, the\nPolicy Seminars of the Centre for\nEnvironmental Policy (CEP) and the\nEnvironmental Technology MSci at\nImperial College are back to in-person\nsessions. The excitement of a classroom\nwith students is coupled with the anticipation of the intense topics that are to be\ndebated in the seminars. By the time this\nissue has been published, there will have\nbeen two seminars, both regarding one\nof the most urgent and discussed topics\nat present: climate change. This is especially relevant as the whole world prepares to tune in to the results of the up-comingUnitedNationsClimateChange\nConference (COP26) at Glasgow.\nDuring the first session, Dr Joeri\nRogelj, the Director of Research at the\nGrantham Institute and Reader in Climate Science and Policy at the Centre\nfor Environmental Policy at Imperial\nCollege London, presents the key in-sightsofthelatestphysicalscienceassess-ment produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\nTheseinsightsshowhowelaboratethe\nphysical science assessment reports are,\nandhowmultiplegroupsofexpertsacross\nthe world are summoned to accomplish\nthis task. The report also emphasizes the rapid and unprecedent effects of\nclimate change, evident in the planet\u2019s\nrising temperatures, the magnitude of\nextreme climate events, and perturbations of biogeochemical cycles. In this\nsense, this report allows policymakers to\nunderstand the urgency and impacts of\nclimatechange,thenecessityofreducing\nemissions, and the need to adapt to the\nalready irreversible impacts of emissions.\nHowever, despite this mounting evidence and unprecedented media com-munication, action is still lacking at the\nvelocity and efficiency we would expect.\nThis is the topic that is introduced in the\nsecond session, by Dan Hamza-Goodacre, a current advisor to the COP Unit\nand the Energy Transition Council.\nHamza-Goodacre also leads the cooling\nsector work at UN High level Champions (amongst many other things).\nHis lecture shows that countries and\ntheir governments have various practic-es, products, technologies, and strategies\nat their disposition to reduce emissions\nand to partly solve the climate crisis, but\nthat they are not being adopted as fast as\nwe would expect. For more rapid action\nto be taken, we need to understand and\nworkininfluencing humanbehaviourso\nthat these already existing practices and\ntechnologies can be implemented and\nused effectively to tackle climate change.\nThe Policy Seminars organized by\nthe CEP at Imperial are valuable spaces\nto revise and educate ourselves on current policy issues, which is of the highest importance for our planet\u2019s future.\nPersonally, I have left the seminars with\nmore questions and a critical thinking\nof the current events, media, and information that I am exposed to everyday.\nThese are the insights that are necessary\nto navigate our rapidly changing world.\nPushing the onus on consumers again\nWhile the pandemic has been a\ntough experience, it has taught\nthe public the importance of banding\ntogether in a crisis and changing our behaviour to align with emerging science\nfor the public good. Why then does\nthis attitude not apply to our current\nclimate crisis? With a long list of countries on fire in the past few years \u2014 some\nhighlights including Australia, Greece,\nthe Russian tundra and most of South\nAmerica - heat waves in Vancouver,\nCanada so significant that they caused\nover 100 deaths (yes, Canada!) and unprecedented mass extinction events, we\nreally must wonder what it would take\nto see this crisis for what it is \u2013 a crisis!\nThe UK government recently published a blueprint named Net Zero\nStrategy: Build Back Greener, relating\nto potential changes in public behaviour including levies on high-carbon\nfoods and frequent flying. Within this\nscheme, seems that the government\nis aligning itself with recent science,\nhighlighting the importance of pricing of consumer goods and its mismatch to their environmental cost.\nHowever, the blueprint was withdrawn\nwithin a few hours of its publication.\nThe science is clear \u2013 animal derived\nproducts are energetically inefficient\nand increase societal carbon footprints.\nA 2020 study in Nature Communications found that calculating the carbon\ndioxide equivalents of foods based on\nIPCC metrics allow them to compare\nthe real-world prices of foods to the\nprices that would be expected if environmental cost is considered. What they\nfound was that plant products would\ncost 121 times less than animal products\nin such a scenario. However, as pointed out in a recently published article\non the blueprint, a government spokesperson has highlighted that research\npapers are not government policy and\nthere are \u201cno plans whatsoever to dictate consumer behaviour in such way\u201d.\nIt sees that the government is trying to enforce the idea that they want\nto protect the free will of people to behave in any way they want. However, in\npractice this is not the case, as making\necologically conscious choices is financially disincentivised. All consumables\nreceive subsidies which ensure they\ncan continue to provide for the public.\nWhile it can be scary to think about\na rise in meat prices, products will always vary in their price with relation to\none another, so increases in some areas\nshould be balanced with subsidies in\nplant foods that should allow the public to sustain itself. However, making\nplanet-healthy choices at present can\nbe at a significant cost to our wallets, as\nwell as convenience and even normality.\nSimilarly, the ever-expanding force of\nthe aviation industry is pushing into the\npublic sphere with ever-reducing prices,\neven for short-haul flights that can easily be replaced with more sustainable\nmodes of transportation. The cheapest\nprice for a plane ticket this weekend\nto Paris from London would cost me\n\u00a337, while the cheapest train ticket for\nthe same day would set me back \u00a3103.\nUnfortunately, while governments\nsupport the industries that impose\nsignificant costs on the environment,\nconsumers with limited financial abilities will be forced to make choices\nthat cost them less but will cost our\nplanet for generations to come. How\nfree is a choice after all if it means paying significantly more out of pocket?\nMonika Yordonova Environment Editor\nView the full\nIPCC report\nhere:\nEnvironmental Policy Seminars are back!\nCarolina Piamonte Environment Writer\nHow much longer will the aviation industry hold power?

But that is what is hap-pening, at Imperial, and in universities\nacross the UK. Voting started on 18th\nOctober and runs until Thursday 4th\nNovember. If enough votes are in fa-vour, lecturers, teachers, administrators,\ntechnical staff, and researchers will be\ntaking the drastic step of withdrawing\ntheir labour and forming picket lines to\npressure university management to stop\ntheir severe and unnecessary cuts.\nNo-one wants to strike. It is always\na last resort. Unfortunately, staff are\nhaving to consider industrial action\ndue to intransigence by university employers \u2014 including Imperial \u2014 and\ntheir refusal to take an evidence-based\napproach to the University Superannuation Scheme (USS) pension scheme.\nThe USS pension scheme\nA Defined Benefit pension scheme\nlike the USS is a form of \u201cdeferred pay\u201d:\nan employee agrees to de-fer, or put aside, some of\ntheir salary now, in return for a guaranteed income \u2014 a proportion of\ntheir average salary over\ntheir career \u2014 on retire-ment. Most academic\nand academic-related\nstaff in pre-1992 universities in the UK, including Imperial College, are\nmembers of the USS.\nAn employee and their\nemployer make contributions into the scheme,\nwhich are collectively invested and,\nwhen the employee retires, their pension\nis paid out of collective USS assets. ImperialCollege\u2014aspartoftheuniversity\nemployers\u2019organisationUniversitiesUK\n(UUK) \u2014 wants to slash the benefits to\nits employees. The UCU estimates that,\nfor example, a 35-year-old lecturer starting work now on spine point 29 at Imperial College is set to lose around 45% of\ntheir guaranteed pension income. This\ncan be seen using an online UCU mod-eller for predicting pension benefits.\nWhat is the dispute over?\nPensions are complicated. But in this\ncase, this time around, UCU believes\nthat the situation is relatively simple.\nThe main organisations involved in\nthe current dispute are USS itself, UUK\n(representing employers), UCU (repre-senting working and retired members of\nUSS) and the Government via the Pensions Regulator (tPR). The Regulator requires USS to assess the value of its fund\nevery 3 years to decide whether they\u2019re\nmaking prudent assumptions about how\nthe fund will behave in the future, and\nwhether it can pay out the pensions that\nit has guaranteed to pay. The last valuation was in 2018. USS then opted to\nperform an early valuation, in March\n2020, just as the stock market fell, mainly due to uncertainties caused by the\nglobal coronavirus pandemic. USS\u2019s\nMarch 2020 valuation reported a deficit\nof \u00a315.4bn. UCU and\nother commentators\nhave criticised this\nvaluation as unscientific and unreliable, as\nwellasbeinguntimely.\nHowever, UCU\nand its members\nare on very strong\nground: even if one\ntakes this March 2020\nheadline deficit of\n\u00a315.4bn, calculated\nby the flawed USS\nmethodology, at face\nvalue, 17 months\nlater on in August 31st 2021, USS assets were valued at \u00a389.6bn which is\n\u00a323.1bn higher than in March 2020:\nThe prima facie evidence is that USS\nisnowinsurplusbymanybillions.Anda\nmore sensible scientific valuation methodology\u2014asrecommendedbytheJoint\nExpert Panel (JEP) set up after the 2018\nstrike over USS \u2014 would likely show\nUSS now to be in surplus by even more.\nThe scarcely credible situation right\nnow is that Imperial College supports\nslashing its employees\u2019 pension benefits\non the basis of a valuation in 2020 that\nhas been overturned by the events of the\nlast year and a half. It is totally unneces-sary. Staff are asking employers to not\nmake the cuts and to work with UCU to\nmake these damaging disputes a thing of\nthe past. But employers are going ahead\nanyway. When pension cuts were proposed by UUK in 2018, on the basis of\nsimilarly flawed arguments, members of\nUCUwentonstriketodefendtheirpensions and won: the proposed cuts were\nnot made and the JEP was set up, giving\nstaff hope that economic sense, financial\nsense, scientific rigour, and greater transparency would prevail at USS. But now\nin 2021, even more severe cuts are being proposed on even flimsier grounds.\nWhat is happening now and what you\ncan do\nIf the vote for industrial action is suc-cessful, UCU will go back to UUK and\nUSS after 4th November and ask them\nto withdraw the planned cuts and work\ntogether. If they don\u2019t then we\u2019ll be in\nthe situation no-one wants, and UCU\nmembers will withdraw our labour and\npicket campus. If staff do go on strike,\nwe will be standing up for ourselves and\nfor the College which needs a good, af-fordable, guaranteed pension scheme\nso that people want to work here and\nso that an academic or academic-relat-ed career is desirable and attainable for\nfuture generations. But we don\u2019t want\nto strike. You can help by writing to the\nProvost and President to ask them to be\nscientific, to look at the evidence and to\nshow leadership by asking that UUK\nwork with UCU to avoid this dispute.\nUCU strikes are an unfortuate\nlast resort\nVijayTymms\nPrincipalTeachingFellowinPhysics,and\nbranchpresidentofImperialCollegeUCU\nOur lecturers, teachers, administrators, technical staff, and researchers are voting on whether to go on strike.\n...

The group recommended a\nscholarship be established in his name.\nProfessor Abdus Salam, 1979 Nobel\nPrize laureate in Physics and lifetime\nphilanthropist to post-colonial\ncountries, was also highlighted by\nthe report. Salam was celebrated with\na blue plaque by English Heritage\nat the end of 2020, which was\ninstalled on his old house in Putney.\nDescribed as \u201cThe Muslim science\ngenius forgotten by history\u201d by the\nBBC, Salam was shunned by his\nhome country of Pakistan.

    "content": "The IPCC\u2019s collaboration with\nthe UN\u2019s is a blessing and a curse\nEnvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nThe UN Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change (IPCC) is tasked with\ncreating periodic reports, reviewing\nscientific literature and compiling the\nlatest research to provide to\npolicymakers and the public. The\norganisation is intended to be objective\nand independent \u2013 it does not carry\nout any research of its own, and reports\nare carefully reviewed by thousands of\nscientists around the world. This has\nled to it becoming one of the leading\nauthorities on climate change, with its\nreports influencing crucial pieces of\nlegislature such as the Paris Agreement.\nThe sixth edition of the IPCC\u2019s\nassessment reports is in production,\nwith the first section released ahead of\nCOP26 in Glasgow.\nThe IPCC\u2019s affiliation with the UN\nis both a blessing and a curse. While\nthe UN\u2019s backing grants the IPCC\nfunding and lends its reports legitimacy,\nit comes at the cost of having to work\nthrough the organisation\u2019s infamous\nbureaucracy. Government officials and\nother stakeholders are permitted to\ncomment on the reports before they\nare released. While these changes will\nnot make it into the final report, recent\nleaks showing suggestions made by\nsome countries give an insight into the\nlengths some will go to in order to avoid\nresponsibility.\nExporters of some of the world\u2019s\nmost carbon intensive resources have\nlobbied hard to remove references to\ntheir products being unsustainable.\nRepresentatives from Argentina and\nBrazil, two of the world\u2019s largest beef\nexporters, made several comments\nrequesting the removal of statements\nthat highlight the destructive\nnature of their exports. It is not\nunfair for countries to want to protect\ntheir own interests, but doing so by\ndisputing well reviewed scientific\nopinion will only make coming to\nan international agreement more\ndifficult. Unfortunately, the UK does\nnot hold the moral high ground in this\nregard either, with the Government\nhaving buried a report by an internal\nresearch group that comes to the same\nconclusions.\nFossilfuelexportershavealsohadtheir\nsay on the results of the report. OPEC\nmembers, including Saudi Arabia, have\nbeen very vocal in their opposition of\nthe report\u2019s conclusions that the use\nof fossil fuels must be phased out in\norder to stay within the limits set by the\nParis Agreement. These countries \u2013 not\nwanting to give up their cash cow just\nyet \u2013 argue the report is biased in its\nconclusions. They claim that the same\neffects can be achieved with Carbon\nCapture and Storage technologies\n(CCS); ignoring the fact that only\none operational power station in the\nworld employs CCS, and that the\nmajority of CCS projects so far have\nbeen used to increase yields from\nnatural gas fields. The Saudi advisor\nalso espouses the benefits of Direct\nAir Capture (DAC), a technology\nthat is both unproven and incredibly\nenergy intensive. This, of course,\nmakes perfect sense \u2013 if Saudi Arabia\u2019s\ninvestment into DAC pays off, they\ncan sell both the poison and the cure,\nwhile also funding another football\nclub or two along the way. Such selfish\ninterests do not bode well going into\nCOP26.\nIn a rather ironic move, Australia is\nlobbying to remove references to how\nits legislature is massively influenced\nby fossil fuel lobbies. The country,\none of the world\u2019s largest exporters of\ncoal, has joined forces with Japan, its\nlargest customer, in trying to keep their\ncoal industries afloat in this period of\nchange.

Australia has the\nlargest known Uranium reserves in\nthe world, and before the Fukushima\ndisaster, Japan was building its nuclear\ngeneration capacity, supplying the\ncountry with a highly reliable and low\ncarbon source of electricity.\nPublic pressure has led to existing\nreactors shutting down and new projects\nbeing cancelled \u2013 of the 39 functional\nreactors in Japan, only 9 are still\nin operation. This lost capacity has been\nreplaced in part with coal, an energy\nsource that releases more radiation into\nthe atmosphere than nuclear power.\nIt is important to note that these\nalterations will not make it into the\nfinal IPCC report \u2013 the reports are\npeer reviewed, and scientists making up\nthe review panel will filter out\nthe blatantly political and biased\ninformation.Whatisworrying,however,\nistheinsightthatthesecommentsgiveus\non the mindset of governments around\nthe world.

    "content": "Enjoy the taste of hometown.\n\u201cEat every grain of rice, or do not\nleave!\u201d\nPerhaps my nonchalance to having\nnice meals originates from my child-hood, thanks to those uncomfortable\nmemories bestowed by my grandpa.\nI can well remember how serious he\nwould become every time he discovered\nme having any left-over food in my bowl.\nIt was like, all of a sudden, all the kindness that always surrounded him would\ndisappear; indeed, if there were left-over\nrice, even when there were merely one\nor two grains left, he would ask me to\ngo back and finish them, regardless of\nhow much I resisted. Just imagine every\nmeal, there is somebody to observe you,\nor rather, stare at your bowl at all times!\nBut those were not the deepest memo-ries. If there were any grain that was accidentally dropped to the floor, no matter who dropped it, my grandpa would\nquickly pick it up and put it into his\nmouth when the family members were\nnot paying attention\u2014just to clarify,\nwe\u2019re not poor at all.\nThere is a long story behind the rice.\nMy grandpa\u2019s generation experienced\nthe dark period when China was being\ninvaded by Japan, and later the Great\nLeap Forward. It was the time when\nthe horrendous famine took away tens\nof millions of lives. There was only one\nbowl of rice for a whole village per day.\nLots of people died. My grandpa survived by eating leaves and grass. At that\ntime, all that he dreamed of was a plain\nbowl of rice. Later, I got a chance to visit the village where my grandpa grew\nup. There, crops were not just food but\nGod. People pay tribute to crops when\nkids are born. People sleep with crops\nforever underneath the earth after they\npass away. They said those crops were the\nsouls of our ancestors. They said if the\ncrops survived, no matter how much difficulty they faced, they knew they could\nsurvive.\nThere is something divine deeply\nrooted in my grandpa\u2019s heart. Mine, too.\nThough I\u2019m not so enthusiastic about\nfood, I missed the rice I eat back home\nso much. Somehow, I managed to buy a\nbag of rice imported from Heilongjiang\nProvince. I enjoyed that familiar taste,\nthe familiar taste from my homeland,\nwhich I have left for exactly one month\nnow. It brings me the feeling and the\nmemory, somehow distant ago across\nthousands of years, of people working\non the field, singing the farming songs.\nThey enjoyed the same taste of rice as\nI do today. Whenever I eat the rice, we\nunite.\nI have invited many of my friends to\nhavemealswithme,withthehiddenreason\u2014to share the taste of my homeland.\nMany of us are international students\ntraveling thousands of miles away from\nhome to pursue our dreams. Maybe we\u2019ll\nbe in a foreign land for decades, and who\nknows where we\u2019ll be for years to come?\nBut no matter where we are, we should\nnot forget where we are from. That is\nwhy this is the rule if you come to have\nmeals with me: eat every grain of rice.\nI wrote a poem months ago after visiting some villages. Many families there\nhad to let their children flee abroad because of war and famine decades ago.\nThey have lost all contact since then.\nThinking of the hometown, I want to\nshare the poem here.

In fact,\nits legacy goes well beyond the domain\nof academia; it is said to have been used\nin the development of the JPEG image\nformat. However, since at least the early\n2000s, \u201cLenna\u201d has been the cause of\ngreat controversy.\n\u201cLenna\u201d is actually a cropped scan of a\ncentrefold image from the Playboy mag-azine. Since its first issue, the US-based\npublication has featured a pin-up of a fe-malemodelonitscentraltwopages,typ-ically nude, except for a brief spell from\n2015 to 2017. But how did a Playboy\ncentrefold end up on the pages of many\na respected science journal?\nThe story goes that in 1973, electrical\nengineers at the University of Southern\nCalifornia Signal and Image Processing\nInstitute were looking for a test image to\ndisplaytheirresultsataconference.Their\nexisting images had begun to bore them;\nthey lacked the characteristics needed\nto rigorously test their algorithms, and\nthe engineers wanted a human face. So\nwhen someone walked in with a copy of\nthe Playboy magazine, they decided to\nuse the centrefold, cropping the image at\nthe shoulders to ensure that the desired\n512\u00d7512 resolution was obtained.\nOver the following years, visitors to\nthe lab would ask for copies of the image so they could compare their own\nprocessing algorithms, and by the 1980s,\nthe image had become something of a\nstandard within the field. Meanwhile\nthe model, Lena Fors\u00e9n, was completely\noblivious to the status of her centrefold.\nShe had moved to the US from Sweden, initially working as an au pair, but\nlaterturnedtomodelling.MsFors\u00e9nwas\nintroduced to Playboy, with whom she\ntook the now-famous image, published\nin late 1972. She was 21 years old at the\ntime the photo was taken. Fors\u00e9n went\non to model for Kodak in New York,\nwith her images being used to calibrate\ncolour film, alongside those of many\nother Caucasian\nwomen (these images were known as\nShirleys and have\nbecome a source\nof controversy in\ntheir own right).\nAt some point, she\nreturned to Sweden.\nIn the mean-time, people began\nto express concern\nat the use of the\nimage in research\npublications. The\npervasiveness of a\npin-up \u2013 moreover,\na Playboy centre-fold \u2013 in an important STEM field\nwas considered\ndegrading, objecti-fying women in the already male-dom-inated world of science.\nIn 1996, the Editor-in-Chief of IEEE\nTransactions on Image Processing, a\npeer-reviewed image processing journal,\nnoted the concerns, stating that the image had been used because it contained\na \u201cnice mixture of detail, flat regions,\nshading, and texture\u201d, but also because it\n\u201cis a picture of an attractive woman\u201d.\nMore recently, in 2015, a high school\nstudent wrote a guest editorial in The\nWashington Post, criticising her school\nfor \u201cmarginalising women\u201d, and citing\nthe use of the \u201cLenna\u201d image in classes,\nalong with \u201csexual comments\u201d by male\nstudents, as a factor in discouraging girls\nin the school from pursing STEM sub-jects. In 2018, Nature Nanotechnology\nannounced that they would no longer\nconsider papers featuring the image,\nadding to a host of publications which\nhad voiced concerns about its use.\nIt is unclear when exactly Lena Fors\u00e9n\nbecame aware of the image\u2019s use in image\nprocessing,butin1997,sheattendedthe\nSociety for Imaging Science and Technology\u2019s 50th Anniversary Conference,\nafter being contacted by the society\u2019s\npresident. At that time, she had returned\nto Sweden, and was working for the gov-ernment, supervising disabled employees in archiving documents. Since then,\nshe has largely avoided the spotlight,\nbut on past occasions, mentioned that\nshe was \u201creally proud of that picture\u201d,\nthough she wished she had been com-pensated. Speaking in December 2019\nfor a documentary on the subject, how-ever, she said, \u201cI retired from modelling\na long time ago.

Love them or hate them,\nthese guys do not need an introduction, especially after\nlast week\u2019s front page.\nI have to say that I do enjoy a good portion of their\nalbums, but I naturally did not have high expectations\nfor the new one, as they are a band originating from\nthe clammy UCL halls of residence. Nonetheless, I\ncame with an open mind. Even if the promotion was\nrather subtle this time \u2013 booking just a few screens at\nTimes Square and a quick light show at the Empire\nState Building \u2013 I had some crumbs of hope left in\nmy pocket. After all, there must be something good in\nthe music coming from a band who put such a valiant\neffort into sustainability.\nMusic of the Spheres starts with a 1-minute-long\npalate cleanse. A cheeky communion bread tasting\nsession. The only remarking characteristic of the track\nis its title \u2013 the ringed planet emoji. This fantastic idea\nhas been linked to Coldplay\u2019s \u201clove of reinvention\u201d by\nthe art critic experts over at The\nSun. Of course, the band did not\nstop at naming just a single song\nwithfunkycharacters,butfeature\nfour emoji titles: \u2018Sparkles\u2019, \u2018Red\nHeart\u2019, \u2018Globe Showing Americas\u2019\n(I wonder why) and \u2018Infinity\u2019. I\nhave not quite delved into emoji\ncritique, so I am leaving it an\nexercise to the reader.\nBack to actual music, Chris\nMartin decides to start singing\nin the second track. With a full-blown radio pop wannabe hit,\nthe band declares their return\nto commercial music, after an\nEveryday Life interlude. Indeed,\nthey do seem to try and capitalise on the 80s synthpop\ntrend started by The Weeknd\u2019s \u2018Blinding Lights\u2019, but\nwithout nearly as much style or personality. Another\nvery derivative song with a pseudo-astro-spiritual flair\nis the one featuring BTS. It has a glitchy outro that lasts\nless than 20 seconds, which I wish were used at the core\nofthepiece.Andletusnotforgetabouttheballadwith\nSelena Gomez, the most forgettable part of the record.\nThefeaturesinthelasttwotracksmentionedarerather\nrandomandsuperfluoustothealbum,yetmakeperfect\nsense: it\u2019s all about the [Money Bag Emoji].\nThe project has some decent tracks, such as\n\u2018Biutyful\u2019. It took me some time to find any enjoyment\nin it, especially because I do not see the need of having\nMartin duet with a pitched-up version of himself. Why\nnot get Gomez to sing here instead?\n\u2018Red Heart\u2019 has the best features of the album.\nJacob Collier and We Are KING aid with a skilful,\ngorgeous, quasi-a cappella performance. The lyrics are\ncorny, though nowhere near the corniness of \u2018People\nof the Pride\u2019. The track is the fake-woke cousin of Tame\nImpala\u2019s\u2018Elephant\u2019\u2013ahomeopathicdilutionofa2010\u2019s\nclassic. The song clearly wants to make a statement, but\nthe overall message is convoluted\nand struggles to connect with its\ntitle. It is undoubtedly my least\nfavourite section of Music of the\nSpheres. Interestingly, that title\nbelonged briefly to \u2018Infinity\u2019,\nthe last emoji track. As a South\nAmerican, when I heard the\n\u201col\u00e9, ol\u00e9, ol\u00e9, ol\u00e9\u201d crowd chant, I\nwas ready to frown upon a weird\ndisplay of exoticism \u2013 but it\nsomehow avoids that. Acclaimed\nproducer and musician Jon\nHopkins constructs a trance beat\nonto the sample, moving the\nlistener towards the introspective\natmosphere that the project had\nbeen struggling to achieve.\n\u2018Infinity\u2019seguesintothefinaltrack,\u2018Coloratura\u2019,with\na drone, before the introduction of a piano-harp motif\nat around the one-minute mark. Martin\u2019s performance\nis a throwback to the early years of Coldplay: the lyrics\nfinally have substance to them, and the overall sound\nis quite uplifting. Going all out with a refreshingly\nmodern take on piano rock, the band develops a\n10-minute epic, which feels very out of place next to\nthe rest of the tracklist, but is ultimately my favourite\nsong on the album. It gives me the hope that I would\nrather not have for their next album, because this one\nwas not great.\nNonetheless,Imustgivecreditwhereitisdue.Music\nof the Spheres is entertaining and has good sequencing.\nIt all feels in place, even if the music itself is not superb.\nMymaingripeiswiththeentiretyoftheextraplanetary\ngimmick. It was not executed to its full potential, as\nmost tracks felt like industry-manufactured music\nboxes with \u201cspacey\u201d designs you find on Etsy splattered\non them. Funnily enough, Chris Martin has said that\ntaking magic mushrooms \u201cconfirmed his suspicions\nabout the universe\u201d. Maybe his suspicions were that his\nband would never make a critically acclaimed album\never again. It is Coldplay being Coldplay, with their\nlittle Sisyphean task.\nFriends That Break Your Heart\nWritten by Pallavi Ojha Music Writer\nIcanalwayscountonJamesBlaketosomehowproduce\nthe perfect soundtrack to\nLondon at night. As someone\nwho regularly sticks on\nan album for an evening\nrun, I welcome the magical\nquality of music that feels as\nif it were made underwater.\nFriends That Break Your\nHeart is no exception. Blake\nflexes his outstanding talent\nas a dynamic producer and\nincredible collaborator in his fifth studio album. SZA\u2019s\nvocals shine over gorgeous chord progressions in\n\u2018Coming Back\u2019.

Innovative\nuniversities like Imperial can come to\nthe front [\u2026] and these kinds of tools\ncan get us back on track to reduce the\nnumbers.\u201d\nHOW MIGHT RTS,S\nIMPACT THE WORLD?\nData from the pilot program\nconducted on over 800,000 children\nin Ghana, Kenya and Malawi showed\nRTS,S increased access to treatment for\nmore than two thirds of children who\nwere not sleeping under bed nets. In this\nway, RTS,S increases equity in access to\nmalaria treatments, reaching children\nwho may not have had access otherwise.\nDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus\nestimates that \u201cusing this vaccine in\naddition to existing tools to prevent\nmalaria could save tens of thousands of\nyoung lives each year\u201d.\nDespite this, the vaccine comes with\nvarious limitations. In addition to\ntargeting only a single malaria parasite,\nRTS,S decreases infections by only 40%\nand deadly severe malaria by under\n30%, which many fear isn\u2019t sufficient.\nWhen asked about this, Professor\nBaum argued that \u201ca 30% reduction in\nsome communities is a big reduction\n[\u2026] RTS,S will definitely make a big\nimpact.\u201d Even then, this level of efficacy\nis only reached after a child has received\nfour doses. Various other control\nmethods have effectively reduced\nmalaria incidence, including drugs for\nprevention and treatment, spray of\ninsecticides and the use of insecticide-treated bed nets. Despite this, malaria\nis still prevalent across the continent.\n\u201cYou have to go at it from every angle.\nMosquito control is a big part of that,\u201d\nsaid Professor Baum. \u201cBed nets have\nbeen the major game changer up until\nnow. The vector strategies are really\nimportant,buttheyare\na component. They\u2019re\nnot the be all and end\nall.\u201d\nThe success of\nRTS,S should be a\nstep forward for future\nvaccine research and\nfunding. However,\none concern stated\nby Professor Baum\nis that the recent\nlicensure of RTS,S by\nthe WHO could lead\nto the incorrect view\nthat malaria has been\ncured. \u201cMy hope is that RTS,S [\u2026] fires\nthe starter gun on vaccine innovation,\u201d\nhe stated. \u201cA diversity of vaccines gives\nus much more tools. I hope RTS,S is the\ngreen light for a new era in vaccinology.\u201d\nCOULD THIS VACCINE\nLEAD TO COMPLETE\nERADICATION OF\nMALARIA?\nWhether this vaccine will completely\neradicate malaria is uncertain. \u201cWe have\nthe willpower and there is the potential\nof tools that could lead to malaria\neradication, but it\u2019s going to require a\nhuge amount of investment,\u201d stressed\nProfessor Baum. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to make\na difference there needs to be a change\nin funding.\u201d When asked whether he\nbelieved malaria would be eradicated he\nstated he hoped so. \u201cIf those resources\nare mobilized, there is no reason why\nwe shouldn\u2019t be able to remove 90% of\nmalaria.\u201d\nHowever, despite the WHO\u2019s\ncommitment to the eradication of\n\u201cevery single malaria parasite from the\nface of the planet\u201d, it is unlikely we will\nsee the same success as with smallpox,\narguably the greatest achievement in\ninternational public health history.\n\u201cEvenwithourmostoptimisticscenarios\nand projections, we face an unavoidable\nfact. Using current tools, we will still\nhave11 millioncasesofmalariainAfrica\nin 2050,\u201d said WHO experts following a\nthree-year review in 2016 which aimed\nto determine how eradication may\nbe achieved. It is clear RTS,S is not a\nreplacement for existing measures but\nan additional weapon in a tool box\nto combat the heavy socioeconomic\nburden caused by malaria. \u201cThis\nlong-awaited landmark decision can\nreinvigorate the fight against malaria in\nthe region at a time when progress on\nmalaria control has stalled,\u201d said Thomas\nBreuer, Chief Global Health Officer at\nGSK. \u201cRTS,S, alongside other malaria\nprevention measures, has the potential\nto save hundreds of thousands of lives.\u201d\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT?\nThe next generation of malaria\nvaccines may be closer to development\nthan we think. Earlier this year,\nresearchers at the University of Oxford\nreported a novel malaria vaccine, R21/\nMatrix-M. R21 was shown to be up\nto 78% effective in trials, the first to\nreach the WHO-specified 75% efficacy.\n\u201cThis is an extremely promising result\nshowing high efficacy of a safe, low-cost, scalable vaccine designed to reach\nthe huge numbers of children who are\nmost at risk of the devastating impact\nof Malaria,\u201d said Lynset Blisand, a senior\npartner at Wellcome Trust, which funds\nthe research. \u201cWhilst further studies are\nrequired, this marks a significant and\nexciting step forward on a critical global\nhealth challenge.\u201d\nMalaria parasite (blue) infecting a red blood cell (red) as imaged by\nan electron micrograph.\nImage credit: Wikimedia Commons\nImage credit: Wikimedia Commons\nHeat map of deaths caused by malaria per million persons in 2012.\n\n"
