Taking for\nexample Darwin who did badly at most\nthings at University but was still able\nto know his professors personally and\ngo fishing with them, finally ending up\non a world cruise on the Beagle which\nlater led to his 'Origin of Species'.\nThe author Is not afraid to quote\nwidely from other authors where they\nsay things better than he could, or to\nuse many sketches and colour plates to\nillustrate the era with his own personal\ninterpretation of them. History can be\nmade very boring when presented in a school textbook manner, every other\nword a date and isolated from events as\nif watching a large scale puppet show;\nbut this book suffers from none of these\ndeficiencies. It gives one a very good\nidea of what made the people of the time\ntick, being a very well balanced account\nand personal interpretation of the social\npressures and events which affected\neveryday life and society at large, viz.\nsocial barriers and class distinction;\nsexual repression and extremely widespread prostitution; the series of very\ncostly and ill fought wars such as the\nCrimea, in which the shambles which\nwas the British Army at the time was\nrealised fully.\nWorth a glance at least, with 296\npages (big ones) and many colour plates,\nand a good reference section. \u2014 Price\n\u00a32.25.\nThe Way In (Charles Tomiinson,\nOxford)\nThe Poetry Book Society Choice of\nthe Year.

This is\nonly a140 page book, so I wonder\nwhether the title is little more than an\nexcuse to write about the cruel Soviet\nsystem.\nNot that that is ideal in its e it. After all, who could rejoice in a system\nwhere Lyuba gets an eight - year\nsentence for anti - Soviet agitation\nwhilst Granya gets only a ten \u2014 year\nsentence for murdering her husband.\nProfessional criminals are regarded by\nthe State as 'Social Allies' and get\nlenient sentences (about five years)\nwhilst political prisoners are regarded\nas 'Social Enemies'.\nBack to the story. Nemov has\nbarely been at the camp before he is\nappointed production chief. When the\nCai'ip Cornmapdant '\u2022a' i pri to ''pad\noffice Nemov is left in charge, imagine\nthat, a new prisoner left in charge of\nthe whole prison camp. It does seem\nas though Solzhenitsyn is trying to send\nthe whole camp up, and he at first\nsucceeds. In the Commandant's absence Nemov increases productivity\nat the camp whilst getting acquainted\nwith- the ways and practices of the\nprisoners. In the foundry prisoners\nget extra rations and pay by making\nirons and treadle sewing machines for\ntheir manager Brylov to sell in the\nnearby town. Even the Commandant is\ncorruptible and accepts vodka and other\ngoods smuggled into the camp.\nFor everyone, from the lowest prisoner\nto the Commandant is struggling to\nsurvive. The Commandant, pressured\nby his bosses for'increased productivity,\nis only too eager to use a boastful\nengineer, Khomich, to drastic a I ly improve\nproduction. After som= persuasive\ntalking by two prisoners who have taken\na dislike to Nemov, he sacks Nemov and\nappoints Khomich in his place. Whilst\nworking in the foundry Nemov realises\nthat in the survival struggle, al! means\nare fair and you can trust no-one.\nCamp conditions are bad but they are\neven worse if you are on'general duties'.\nAlthough he later admits to '_yu ba( about being on general duties) 'It's horrible, it's as good as a death sentence.\n(Pause) Only being a boss is worse than\ndj a th'. His relationship with Lyuba starts\naf tei his d isms sal as production chief.\nLyuba is a camp love\u2014giri who is\nprepared to sell herself for priv el edges and extra rations. She has seen so\nmuch of camp life to know that this is\nthe only way to survive. She starts\noff wary of his love and treats him as\nany other camp\u2014lover. Nemov has\nfallen passionately in love with Lyuba,\nbut she whilst feeling deeply for Nemov,\nappreciates the realities of camp life,\nwhich he does not, and realises that\ntheir affair cannot go much further.\nThe camp doctor fancies her and even\nthough she rejects him, she knows that\nshe will either have to love both Nemov\nand the doctor or else Nemov or herself\nwill get transported to another camp.\nNemov is uncompromising but in a desperate bid. Lyuba, realising the\nconsequences of his action, tells the\ndoctor that she will be his love\u2014girl.\nThus Lyuba and Nemov are to be kept\ntogether in the same camp. Their\nhappiness is short lived as Nemov is\nnearly killed in an accident at the\nfoundry. The book ends with a group\nof political prisoners being transferred\nto a much harder camp on the Crimean\nRiver.\nAt 35p the book represents good\nvalue to an/one who has not encountered\nSolzhenitsyns writing before. To\nthose who have read some of his other\nworks this represents a rather timid\ncompanion. As a play it does not show\nenough of the Nemov\u2014Lyuba relationship\nand is more concerned with showing\nconditions in the camp \u2014 and in this it\npresents a very true picture.\n\n"

    "content": "Editorial\nFELIX goes offset-Utho\nIT HAS FINALLY HAPPENED. At long last we are now able to print\nFELIX on our own offset\u2014litho unit.\nWe have already published the Union\nDiary (which incorporates the College\nregistration card) and the new\u2014format\nBluebook which now has Societies\ninformation. The results from these\ntwo publications have been fairly\nimpressive.\nEstablishing the printing\u2014unit and\nmaking it operational has been by no\nmeans an easy task. In the past six\nweeks, various mechanics have made\na total of about ten calls to repair/\nadjust faulty equipment \u2014 which ex plains why it has been impossible to\nproduce a FELIX at an earlier date.\nNow that the first FELIX of the year\nhas been completed, it just has to be\nsighs of relief all round. And we\nreally have to thank Kyrle Gillespie,\nour litho operator, for all the suggestions\nand guidance which he has given in these\nearly stages. One wonders what would\nhave happened without him.\nA journalist's nightmare is surely\none where a particular story undergoes\nmajor developments just after it has been\nwritten and set in print. What should\nhe do? Does he rip the story out and\nrewrite it or does he plead ignorance to\nbeing aware of further developments?\nOne such instance has occured in\nconnection with the story of the construction work being carried out on Weeks\nHall. At first, the issue was the reason\nwhy the concrete slabs were falling off\nthe front of the building; then it was\ndiscovered that the concrete used in\nthe beams (not the slab facings) of the\nhall were made from the same cement\nwhich caused a school's roof to collapse\nabout a year ago. So clearly the major\nissue now is :\u2014 What happens if further\ninternal construction work if required\nin Weeks Hall? (STOP PRESS It is\nunderstood that Weeks will be evacuated\nfor at least the first term and its future\nis indefinite).\nIt tends to be a feature of many\n'first editorials' for the Editor to guffaw\nand ramble on about plans for future\nissues and generally to make promises\nwhich he can only be vaguely sure of\nbeing able to keep. I do not plan to\ndo that sort of thing, so there.

After intermittent negotiations over\na long period of time, the final outcome has been a college\ndecision to the effect that:\n'I. With effect from 1st October 1974, the rate of pay for part-time student demonstrators\nshould be the inclusive sum of\n\u00a32.00 per contact hour for any\nform of demonstrating and\ntutorial work. The new rate\nis inclusive of preparation time\nfor which no additional payment\nor allowance should be made.\n2. The new hourly rate is tied\nto the lower end of the Lecturers'\nPay Scale from Ist October 1974,\nand will be increased by the\nsame percentage addition as\nmay be applied to that scale\nfrom time to time, subject to\nthe constraints of Government\nlegislation, UGC direction or\nadvice from the CVCP'.\nBoth the fact that the rate\nfor demonstrating is \u00a32.00 per\ncontact hour, and that this is\ntied to the lower end of the\nLecturers' Pay Scale is welcome.\nHowever, since this is inclusive\nof preparation time, it means\nthat effectively there is no\nincrease in the tutoring rate.\nThis point has been taken up\nwith the College and we hope\nthat some sort of solution will\nbe found. It would help our\ncase if the PG' s doing tutoring\nwork could get in touch with me\nand tell me how much they are\nearning at present, because the\nrate appears to vary from department to department.\nLORD BLACKETT, Senior Research Fellow of the\nDepartment of Physics died, aged 76. in July.\nHis scientific career sparred some 55 years during which he\nbecame one of the world's most distinguished scientists.

His work\nthere, on the bombardment of\nnitrogen with alpha-particles,\nalong with his experiments on\ncosmic rays (which led to the\nobservation of the positron),\nensured his international\nreputation.\nBlackett left Cambridge for\nBirkbeck in 1933 where he\nworked for four years; it was\nat this time that he set up an\nexperiment 100 feet below\nground, in Holborn tube station,\nto measure the penetrative\npower of cosmic rays.\nFELIX Michael J.

    "content": "Prof Slams\nUG Standards\nPROFESSOR J.R. A. Pearson, of the Department of Chemical\nEngineering has publicly criticised undergraduate standards.\nIn a letter to New Scientist, Prof. Pearson says that 'Few of\nthem have much grasp of the subjects they have studied' and on\nthe subject of professional competence, 'in many cases they will\nclearly never become 40'.\nHe goes on to blame the trouble\nchiefly on the rapid expansion\nin numbers which universities\nhave undergone in the past\nfifteen years and expresses his\ndissatisfaction with the\ngovernment policy which\ngoverns such expansion.\nNot to be outdone by this,\nMr. Steve Webb, a research\nassistant in the Cosmic Ray\nGroup in the Department of\nPhysics, put pen to paper in\ndefence of undergraduates.\nHe stated the point that criticism should be more appropriately\nleveled at falling lecturer\nstandards and the deterioration\nof staff/student contact. He\nalso makes a valid dist ict ion between education and training\n\u2014 'It has never been the claim\nof departments teaching pure\nscience and mathematics that\nthey are preparing people for a job'.\nBoth letters are reprinted\nbelow.\nSir,\u2014Your leader on jobs for\nwomen graduates (Comment,\n27 June, p743) prompts me to\nsay that it is high time somebody\ntold the truth about the abilities\nand achievements of most\ngraduates in science and\nengineering on leaving univers it y in Britain. Few of them have\nmuch grasp of the subjects\nthey have studied. They do\nnot understand the fundamentals\nand they have little idea of\nhow to apply them. The gap\nbetween what is hoped for in\ntheir examination or thesis\nperformance and what is achieved\nis regularly depressing. It is\nfrivolous to suppose that these\ngraduates are professionally\ncompetent, and in many cases\nthey will clearly never become\nso. What is surprising is not\nthat a small proportion are\nlater employed as technicians\nbut rather that so many of them\nare employed professionally at\nall. Small wonder that their\nsalaries have fallen in relative\nterms.\nAbout 15 years ago some\nvoices were raised against rapid\nand massive expansion of the\nuniversity system and it was\nargued that there was not a sufficient untapped reserve of\ntalent to maintain university\nstandards as they had been\ntraditionally understood. We\nnow know that these forebodings\nwere justified.\nFalling average standards\nmay have no serious repercussions in some subjects.\nThey are, however, disastrous\nin professional disciplines,\nparticularly in science and\ntechnology. Yet we pretend\nthat they have not fallen. The\ngovernment assumes that a nationally uniform three\u2014year\nundergraduate course is still\nan adequate period of formal\ntraining for our leading tech-no logi sts. It is not and it is\ntime that they encouraged\nexcellence and continued study\namong the more ambitious and\ngifted students. Extravagant\nplans for tertiary education\nhave already exceeded what\nthe national budget will stand.\nCuts in the real value of\nuniversity grants have already\nbeen made. It is now no\nlonger possible to be enthusiastically in favour of a general increase in student\nnumbers without further endangering the quality of our\noutput.\nThis is not to put the blame\non a desire to teach science\nand engineering as widely as\npossible, nor on the students\nthemselves. It is an indictment\nof those who should be insisting\non righting the situation but\nwho instead pretend that all is\nwell.\nImperial\nLondon\nJ.R. A. Pearson\nCollege\nSir,\u2014In suggesting that falling\nstandards in graduate achievement are responsible for\nfalling salaries in graduate\nemployment, J. PearsontLetters,\n4 July, p46) appears to be\nputting the cart before the\nhorse. He suggests that\nscience graduates do not\nunderstand the fundamentals\nof their subject and have little\nidea of how to apply them. If\nthis is so it is not for the\nreason implied. The quality\nof students admitted has not\ndeteriorated as departments\nhave expanded. What has\ndeteriorated is the personal\ncontact which once existed\nbetween staff and students and\nan atmosphere congenial for\nstudy. It is an insult to\nreduce a student to a mere\nstatistic. The most that too\nmany students, having difficulty\nwith their work, can expect is a few somewhat grudgingly\nspared minutes with their tutor,\nand lecture halls are too crowded\nto permit sensible questioning\nat that time. Meanwhile\ncourses become tougher and\nlectures move more rapidly to\nadvanced work, often wrongly\nassuming that the fundamentals\nwill be covered elsewhere.\nWhile it is the most they can\ndo to take down notes during\never faster delivered lectures\nand questions are discouraged,\nit is hardly surprising that\nKMCKKftS!\nWHEN A group calling itself the Communist University of London (C.U.L.) decided to hold a week\u2014long\nconference (7th \u2014 14th July), in the IC Union building,\none event which could not have been anticipated was\ntheir decision to pass a motion condemning the\npresence of the knickers\nin the Union Bar. 'Sex-is ts!' came the communist\naccusation, 'take your\nknickers down!'. But\nthings got beyond a joke\nwhen, on the Friday\nevening, an intrepid\ncommunist acquired a long pole in order to remove\nthese feminine garments.\nBig Andy Clapham\neasily wrested the pole\nfrom the assailant but\nclearly by this time things\nhad got beyond a joke.\nNearer to closing time,\nanother incident marred\nthe C.U.L.' s hitherto\nspotless record when one\nof the barmen, Alan\nLarson, was apparently\nthreatened with a beer\nglass.\nOn re-opening the\nfollowing evening, the\nmembers of the C.U.L. re\u2014generated the previous\nnight's provocation and\nBrendan Clemments,\nanother barman, closed\ndown the bar and allowed\nonly registration card-carrying IC students onto\nthe premises.\nAs a result of these\nevents, Mr.J. A. Lane, the\nC.U.L. organiser and\nformer ICU President, had\n\u00a320 of his deposit forfeited.\nstudents have little time left\nover to think what it all means.\nAbility to remember vast tracts\nof such lectures for examination\nbeing considered all important\ndoes not exactly help, either.\nAs to the criticism that\ngraduates have little idea how\nto apply their studies, Pearson\nseems to have confused education with training. It has\nnever been the claim of departments teaching pure science\nand mathematics that they are\npreparing people for a job.\nPerhaps the lack of job-satisfaction presently being\nexperienced by the products\nof such departments is evidence\nthat the nature of courses\nshould change, particularly as\nopportunities to remain 'inside'\nuniversity are decreasing\nrapidly. Progress and come\nabout only when lecturers are\nprepared to dirty their hands a little and see what is really\nrequired of new graduates.\nThe message comes back loud\nand clear that in their present\nform they are not required.\nPerhaps in the very near future\nwe should be seriously drawing\na clear distinction between\nactivities inside a university\nwhich are geared to future\nemployment and those for the\nedification of the soul. If\nboth were afforded equal value\nthere might be some chance\nof educating a less frustrated\ngraduate who can find his place\nin society.\nSteve Webb\nDepartment of Physics\nImperial College\nLondon\nThese letters first appeared\nin New Scientist, London, the\nweekly review of science and\ntechnology.\n\n"

    "content": "10 FELIX\nWEEKS MALL:\nThe present\nsituation looks\ngloomy\nIS WEEKS HALL about to fall down? The answer\nis :\u2014 in the short term, probably not, but in the long\nterm it is quite a possibility. Ever since it was\nbuilt fifteen years ago, Weeks has been dogged by the\nfact that the concrete block facings just under each\nwindow were continually\ncrumbling and creating a potential hazard for\npassers-by. Contractors\nwork on the replacement\nof the blocks started at\nthe beginning of the\nsummer at a cost estimated\nto be in the region of\n\u00a340,000.\nThere is speculation\nas to why the blocks are\nfalling apart. Mr. P.W. Throsby. Warden of Weeks\nHall, suggested that it\nmight be 'natural decay\nfrom moisture etc.', but\nseveral engineering PCs have suggested to FELIX\nthat in fact the building\nmay have be inadequately\ndesigned, the gist being\nthat holes for the central\nheating pines had to be\ndrilled^ right through the\nconcrete blocks and this\ntended to disturb the\ninherent tensile strength\nof the concrete.\nAs though this were\nFOR SEVERAL weeks now,\nthere have been wild rumours\nabout the existence of a new\nspecies of carnivorous\nmammals known as Homo\nsuper sapiens postgraduate\n(PG for short) writes our P iG\ncorrespondent, Tom Abraham.\nUnfortunately, it has been very\ndifficult to verify these rumours,\nthe main reason being that they\nare indistinguishable from the\nrun of the mill Homo sapiens\nlike you and me (Speak for\nyourself \u2014 Ed). However,\nintrepid researchers led by\nProf. Abe Rahim are hard at\nwork trying to isolate this\nspecies. Abe Rahim is 96.\n(And he doesn't look a day\nolder than 22 \u2014 Ed).\nDuring a recent interview,\nProf. Rahim admitted that\nalthough progress had been\nmade, there was still 'a long\nway to go'. A few specimens\nhad been obtained and a thorough\nexamination of their internal,\nexternal and mental characteristics was being carried\nout by a group known as the\nICPGG. When he had approached one of the specimens\nit had emitted a loud screech\nwhich necessitated an instant\nwithdrawal. The screech\nseemed to sound something\nlike 'I want to go home to\nmummy' (God these space fillers\njust get worse \u2014 Ed).\nSpeaking about his efforts\nto isolate the species, Prof.\nRahim said that late last year,\nsome specimens betrayed\nthemselves when they suddenly\nrealised that they were being\ngiven insufficient meat for a type of mental activity known\nas demonstrating. After a lot of whining and groaning,\nthey did manage to persuade\nthe authorities to vit u ally double their meat allowance.\nHowever, these specimens\nquickly disappeared once it\nappeared that they had won\ntheir objectives.\nWhen I made a comment about\nthe haggard, unkempt and\nunder\u2014fed look on the faces of\nthe specimens, Prof. Rahim\ncited two reasons for this.\nOne was the extraordinarily\nlong queues in Southside due\nto a virtual takeover of College\nfacilities by another species\npopularly known as sub\u2014human a e to belong to the genus Homo\nsapiens). The second reason\nwas the extremely pitiful amount\nof money set aside for the\npreservation of this species.\nHowever, since the overthrow\nof Col. Heathco by Col. Wislon\nin the recent bloodless coup,\nhe was more hopeful about an\nincrease in the grant (written\nbefore the government announcement \u2014 Ed).\nFinally, when confronted\nwith the rumour that there were\n1500 specimens in or around\nImperial College, Prof. Rahim\nretorted 'Bull***t'. He\ncategorically stated that only\ntwo specimens had so far been\nisolated and he had both of them.\nReaders will be kept informed\nabout any advances in this\nmost exciting field of research.\nnot bad enough, misfortune\nstruck Weeks Hall again\nwhen it was discovered\nthat the concrete in the\nbeams supporting the\nbuilding was a special\nquick\u2014drying, high alumina\ntype and it was concrete\nof this nature which,\napparently, was thought\nto be responsible for the\nroof of a school collapsing\nabout a year ago.\nAs a result consultants,\nMessrs. Clarke, Nicholls\nand Marcel, were appointed\nat a cost of \u00a38,000 to\nassess the hall by means\nof a physical test involving\ndeflect o meters provided\nby the Civil Engineering\nDepartment here at IC.\nIt would appear that\nfurther internal reinforcement work on each\nroom is a possibility\nwhich is not being ruled\nout. Meanwhile, it has\njust been learnt that\nWeeks Hall will be\nevacuated for at least\nthe first term. Presumably\nthe hall residents will be\nfiltered into places in\nresidence created by\nstudents who fail their\nexams and Vlth former s who fail their A levels.\nIt is tough luck on\nthose who are top of the\nre applicants reserve lists\nthough.\n\n"

    "content": "4 FIt l X PRESIDENTIAL\nAfter five weeks as President of Imperial\nCollege Union, it is perhaps appropriate\nto take a look at two of the major issues\nwhich are, at present, confronting stud-ents, particularly postgraduate students.\nI do not propose, at present, to do more\nthan outline these issues and indicate\nmy attitude; this is neither the time nor\nthe place to do more.\nFirst and foremost \u2014 postgraduate\ngrants. All SRC award holders will have\nreceived letters telling them that they\nwere not getting their increase until\nJanuary. Since then, pressure from the\nDepartment of Education and Science\nhas caused a rapid reversal of the\nSRC's attitude, and you will now be\nreceiving the increase in October's cheque. Strangely enough, the DES had\nto be told by the NUS and the Colleges\n(certainly this one) that the SRC was\nhad \"neglected\" to let them know! Did\nI hear someone say \"Bloody bureau-crats\"? _ .\nThe reaction that I have had from\nsome PG's to the level of their grant\n(\u00a3960) was one of disappointment.\nDespite the welcome concession of\nthe London weighting, the Government has given us a palliative, not\na decent grant. Coupled with this,\nthe DES, presumably at the Treasury's insistence, has taken a step\nbackwards by the introduction of the\nspouse's contribution.\nIt is clear that no\u2014one is prepared at\nthis point to spend more on postgraduate\neducation. Yet everyone is complaining\nthat there are not enough students doing\npostgraduate work, and wondering why.\nI need hardly point out to a postgraduate\nthe massive difference between his\nincome and standard of living, and that\nof the man in industry \u2014 even if, as is\noften the case, the latter is doing\nprecisely the same work as the former,.\nBoth the DES and the Committee of\nVice\u2014Chancellors and Principals have\nset up working parties on postgraduate\neducation.\nIt is doubtful whether they will\nrecognise what is needed \u2014 a complete revamping of the system of\npostgraduate education, to make it\nmore flexible, more realistic, and\nmore worthwhile; but students,\nthrough direct pressure on and discussion with the colleges, and\nthrough NUS, should contribute\ndirectly to the debate on postgraduate\neducation. What is needed now is\nnot piecemeal grant increments, but\nthat postgraduates be treated as\nthey deserve.\nMany students have complained to me\nabout the rise in refectory prices on 1st August. The Governing Body decided,\nat the end of the summer term, that it\nwas necessary to raise prices to meet\ninflation and rising costs. We argued\nvery st on gly at that meeting that not\nvery strongly at that meeting that not\nonly could students' pockets not stand\nit, but that raising prices would do little\ngood, because many students would\nsimply stop using the refectories, unless\nthere were a vast improvement in service\nand quality. The way to increase turn-over, we said, was to serve better food\nin a more acceptable way \u2014 let's face\nit, you're hardly encouraged to eat in\nSouthside by the service!\nThey did not accept this (though I believe that the autumn term accounts\nwill prove us right), and increased prices\nby 17V z% across the board. However,\nthey did concur with our view that the\nreal culprit was not Mr. Mooney, but the\nUGC (from which the college derives\nTrev Phillips\nmost of its income), which has a rule\nthat refectories cannot be sub sidi sed. The Governing Body is, in effect, committed to the view that refectories cannot\nbe run without subsidy in a time of high\ninflation, and is therefore to make representations to the UGC, to drop the rule.\nIn the short term, I hope that we can\nprove our point when the Union refectory\nreopens; the service and quality over\nhere has improved enormously. I believe\nif we were to hold the prices here down\nto the old level, that the increased sales\nwould easily cover costs, and the formula of \"low profit margin, high quality\nand good service\" would have proved\nitself.\nI have had a request from an over\u2014\n60's group in Fulham for help; anyone\nwho can spare the time, particularly if\nyou can entertain by singing, etc., let\nme know. Any help would be appr-e cia ted. I have not yet named my column.\nThe best suggestion wins a prize \u2014 or\nsomething. (How about Preci Pice? -Ed.)\nFinally, two quotations about another\npresidency:\u2014\n\"Sir, I would rather be right than be\npresident\". (Henry Clay, U.S. Senate,\n1850).\n\"I am not a crook\". (Richard Nixon,\n1973).\nNo comment.\nDO\nBACK ISSUES\nEspecially Issues279313334,336,339,338,342,350,357. "

When asked to pose for\nFELIX, her hesitation was\nnatural, but as you can see, her\nreluctance was short\u2014lived.\nThis picture was taken next to\nthe Round Pond in Kensington\nGardens in the middle of August.\nKatie will be with us in\nfuture issues as a regular\ncolumnist and it is hoped also\n\\to maintain this 'bird\u2014watchers\nspot' as a weekly feature.\nPhoto: RAMON NEWMANN\nTHEFT RAISES INSURANCE QUESTION\nON FRIDAY, 5th July, a theft was committed in Falmouth Hal I to the tune of \u00a3350.\nA stereo, two cassette\ndecks, 50 records and \u00a315\ncash were taken from Physics\nthird year Ian Reid's room\nwhilst he was with friends\nat the cinema.\nTne decision to go and see\na film was taken shortly before\nthey left at 7.30 p.m. with the\ndoor of the room locked. At\n8.30 p.m., Paul Wadsworth, last\nyear's Editor of FELIX, and\nowner of one of the cassette\ndecks, knocked on the door of\nthe room (though he did not try\nthe handle) and got no reply.\nAt 11.20 p.m., when Ian and his\nfriends returned, the door was\nLETTER OF ACCEPTANCE\n= REGISTRATION?\nSUMMER\nACCOMMODATION\nWHEN A1 st year P.G. overseas student with a letter of acceptance to\nImperial College asked to\nbe put up for a few nights\nat the Summer Accommodation Centre, he expected\nto be treated as an I.C. student and to pay the\nstudent rate of 70p per\nnight. Imagine his surprise\nwhen he was asked to pay\nthe full tourist rate of\n\u00a32.45 on the grounds that\n\"he is not an I.C. student\nuntil he has registered in\nOctober\".\nAhmad Vakilzadeh, the\noffice manager, told FELIX that there was considerable discussion in the\nS.A.C. office as to whether\nthe full rate or student\nrate should be charged\nand Mrs. Spencely-Collins,\nthis year's Scheme Man ager, put the matter to\nCollege Block but in the\nmeantime took the decision\nto charge the full rate of\n\u00a32.45, which the student\nhad no option but to pay.\nFinally, clarification\ncame from Mr. C.K. Mc\u2014\nDowall (Chairman of the\nOverseas Students Committee) and it is understood\nthat \" if overseas stu dents produce their letter\nof acceptance ... they will\nbe treated as registered\nstudents\". FELIX put it\nto Mrs. Spencely\u2014Collins\nthat a refund to the stu dent might be appropriate.\nHer comment was \" I don't know about that\".\nThe Summer Accommodation Centre is essentially\na hotel scheme which is run every summer. Hall\nrooms are let to tourists\nat standard hotel prices.\nIt is believed that the\nmajor part of the profits\nfrom the scheme are used\nto help run the halls during\nthe term. The scheme\nemploys students to act\nas cleaners in return for\na free room and roughly\n\u00a310 per week in wages.\nCleaners this year\ncriticised the apparently\nnew policy adopted by the\nscheme to the effect that\nmany of the cleaners were\n\"crammed into the triple\nrooms of Garden Hall\" \u2014\nas one cleaner put it. It\nseems that in the past,\ncleaners have been able\nto have a room in one of\nthe newer halls (e. g.L in stead or Southside).\nMany blame the triple\nroom situation on the fact\nthat, at one stage, the\nscheme was hopelessly\noverbooked, but it was\nnevertheless eventually\nagreed to pay the cleaners\na bonus equivalent to 4\nhours overtime per week.\nand the theft, thought to be\nan \"inside job\", had been\ncommitted.\nThe police were called but\nwith so many master and sub master keys in existence, their\njob cannot be described as easy.\nEven Mr. Argent of College\nsecurity who went to great\nlengths to interview many of\nlan's acquaintances was unable\nto come up with anything concrete\nThe position of the College's insurance policy now raises\nquestions regarding its adequacy\nbecause it makes provision\nonly for force able entry and\ncovers loss only up to \u00a3200.\nFortunately, Ian and his girl friend, who lost the 50 records\nand \u00a315 cash, were covered by\ntheir respective parents' policies, but not so Paul Wadsworth who is apparently just\npressing optimistically a claim\non the College policy through\nthe normal channels.\nIan Reid\n\"College policy should be\nmore clearly explained to\nstudents regarding up to what\nsum and under what circumstances they are covered\" is\nIan Reid's view, but FELIX wishes to raise the question:\u2014\nRecognising the apparent ease\nwith which this theft was\ncarried out, is the College\ninsurance policy adequate?\nGranted that 'force able entry'\ntends to eliminate the possibility of claims turning out to\nbe pranks, but would not a police statement to the effect\nthat they were satisfied that a bur gular y had been committed,\nbe sufficient?\nAnd only three weeks\nprevious to the theft, the\nStudent Halls Committe did\nstate that they considered\n\"\u00a3200 insurance cover too low\".\n\n"

Most\nof us were probably hoping for\na quiet peaceful summer, when\nthe undergrads left. However\nthat has not been the case,\nbecause somebody up there,\nin their infinite wisdom,\ndecided to bring in American\ntourists to keep us company.\nWe are told that the money that\nwe get from them is used to\nkeep down Hall fees. Well,\nI guess we have got no choice\nbut to suffer the inconvenience.\nThe ICPGG, which stands\nfor Imperial College Post graduate Group, is organising\na few events. All that is required for these events to be\nsuccessful is for postgraduates\nto participate in them. We\nalso hope to show some films\nbetween now and the end of\nSeptember and these will be\nadvertised as widely as possible.\nThere have been few Union\nactivities during the summer.\nPart of the reason lies in the\napathy among many postgraduate\nstudents. However, the main\nreason is that many of the\nclubs and committees cease\nto function over the holidays.\nI am hoping that this state of\naffairs can be reversed, and\nhopefully in the coming session\nthese things will be put right\nunder the dynamic leadership\nof Yours truly.\nICPGG has a committee\nconsisting of the PG Affairs\nOfficer who acts as chairman,\na secretary, a treasurer and\none representative from each\ndepartment.
