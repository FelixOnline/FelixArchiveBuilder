This is the latest in a string of films based on the plays\nof American writer Neil Simon.\nThe star-studded cast includes\nsuch greats as Michael Caine,\nAlan (M.A.S.H.) Alda, Bill Cosby,\nWalter Matthau, Jane Fonda and\nmore.\nThe setting is the world famous\nBeverly Hills Hotel, cocktails, sun,\npalm trees and all. Five separate\ncouples converge on the hotel for\nvarious reasons and through the\nobservation of their separate\nstories an original, amusing plot is\nobtained. The various progressions in personal relationships are\nheavily exploited to create some\nhilarious moments. In an effort to\navoid giving away too much of the\nstory, I can only list the various\ncouples.\nDiane Barry is an actress who\nhas been nominated for an Oscar\naward and arrives from England\nwith her husband Sidney. Hannah\nand Bill Warren are divorced and\nare both seeking custody of their\ndaughter. Bill Cosby and Richard\nInvasion of The Body Snatchers\n(X, Philip Kaufman)\nThis remake of Don Siegel's1956 classic is bound to arouse a lot of interest over Easter, but is it\nworth it? All of this and more will\nbe revealed below\nMatthew Ben nell( Donald Sutherland) is a public health\ninspector who is in love with his\nassistant Elizabeth Driscoll( Brooke Adams). She, however, is\nliving with Geoffrey who has been\nacting very strangely lately. It\nsounds a bit like \"Crossroads\" but\nthis is the relationship which leads\nMatthew and Elizabeth to believe\nthat alien beings have invaded\nEarth and are taking over human\nbodies. Their fight for survival is\naided by friends, including Dr.\nDavid Kibner (Leonard Nimoy),\nand opposed by masses of\nemotion less aliens.\nAfter a poor start the film\naccelerates to an exciting pace.\nThe aliens seem unbeatable and\nare given a quite unusual treatment. The people taken over\nPryor play two doctors who are\nintense rivals. Marvin Michaels is\nthe inevitable innocent party,\nwhose wife arrives to find a woman in his room.\nWith all of these couples, love\nand marriage are the common\nfactors. The way in which these\nare dealt with is very funny, but\nthere are some very serious and\nmoving scenes. This is especially\ntrue for Diane Barry (Maggie\nSmith) and Sidney (Michael\nCaine). Fine performances from\nboth actors are a pleasure to\nwatch. Neil Simon is extremely\nclever in that there is no limit on\nthe types of comedy he can\nintroduce by keeping the film as\nfour separate stories. There is\nslapstick as well as some very\nclever (dare I say) intellectual\nhumour.\nThis film has something for\neverybody and should not be\nmissed if you like \"situation-comedy\" type television programmes.\nThat is not to say that it is like a cheap midweek television show.\nOn the contrary, the money and\nacting talent has been used\ncarefully to produce a polished\nand very enjoyable comedy.\nMark Smith\nare not portrayed as \"zombies\"\nbut as a different kind of man,\nperhaps superior due to a lack of\nemotion. Our hero cannot appreciate this and is determined\nRECORD FRANK ZAPPA SHEIK YER BOUTI \"Hey! Do you know what you are?\nYou're an asshole! AX ASSHOLE!\"\nYes, Dirty Uncle Frankie is\nback! Sheik Yerbouti, a double\nsemi-live album, and his first since\nsigning with CBS from Discreet\nRecords, is certainly what Zappa\nfans have been waiting for.\nShowing much of his old\nimagination, and quirk ly shrugging off the \"Sleep Dirt\" disaster, /i erdo takes the stage\nagain.\nThe album's first track, \"I have\nbeen in you\", promises much with\nits interesting lyrics, interplay\nbetween lead and backing vocals\nand line sound quality. This\ncatches the ear and it is at this\npoint that one realises that the\nvocals are not the original\nrecording, but an overdub onto\nthe live backing track, which was\ntaken from a recent Hammersmith Odeon performance, as was\na majority of the album's material. This eo up led with the\ninteresting feature of editing each\ntrack into the next, rare for a studio or live album, maintains\nthe flow of sounds. \"Broken\nHearts for Assholes\" is typical\nZappa; a sort of cross between\ninsanity and Jazz-rock, which he\ncombines with his penchant for\naudience abuse.\nNothing on side two. on which,\nincident ly, we have moved to the\nnew York Paddladium, is worth a mention, including two half-minute tracks, until the superb\n\"Bobby Brown\" a sort of \"look\nat me, I'm proud to be American\" take off, about a guy who loses his\nbearings; Zappa in fine form. The last two tracks are from Berlin.\nand frankly they sound like\nFocus on a bad day, which is true\nof much of the patchy material on\nthis album.\nSide Three is the highlight and\npossibly worth the asking price on\nit's own. The short \" Baby Snakes\" goes straight into\n\" Try in' to Grow a Chin\",a song\nwith a persecution complex if ever\nthere was one; \" Why amI livin'? I wish I was dead. Please kill me.\" Get the picture? We've heard it\nall before but what the heck.\nA bit of applause, the first on\nthis \" live\" album, and we're into\n\" City of Tiny Lights\", featuring\nguitarist. Adrian Belew on vocals.\nPossibly the strength of this\nsequence is the interchanging\nbetween vocalists, also including\ndrummer. Terry Bozzier. Back to\nZappa now on \" Dancin' Fool\", soon out as a single. This takes the\nwhole disco scene and rips it up\npiece by piece. The suave pick-up\nartist also suffers; \"Hey Darlin'\n...Can 1 buy you a drink?\nII ail a minute I 've got il... You're\nItalian! Hah?\nYer Jewish? Love your nails ....You\nmust be a Libra.\"\nIf you don't buy the album, at\nleast treat yourself to this\nexcellent single.\nThe final track on side three,\n\"Jewish Princess\", is peppered\nwith sexual innuendo and as such\nshould pick up bans all over the\nplace, although I'm sure IC Radio will be playing it.\nSide Four is terrible - Forget it.\nUnless of course you're a Zappa freak in which case it's probably\nright up your street.\nWell that's your lot; I 'll be back\nafter the Easter Break taking a look at some of the records that\ncome out in the meantime.\nJon Firth\nto rid the world of the invaders.\nThe conflict which follows is very\ninteresting and, thanks to some\nexcellent camera work and a fine\nsound track, the film succeeds in\nmm\nMatthew Bennell (Donald Sutherland) captured by aliens\nmaking you feel that you too are\nthreatened.\nThe film has several drawbacks\nhowever. It is not one of those\nreally memorable movies, probably because of the outrageous story. Far too many\n\"red herrings\" are thrown in which\nmay intrigue a few but confuse\nmost. The most ridiculous thing in\nmy mind was the inclusion of\n\" Amazing Grace\" in the soundtrack at an inappropriate\npoint. Why this happened I just\ndon't know.\nTo summarise I would say that\neven though parts of the film are\nspurious and dull, it is generally\nvery entertaining and shocks in\nthe desired way. Remakes are\nvery difficult and this must rank as\none of the best, if only for the\nappearance of Don Siegel and\nKevin McCarthy (a star in the\noriginal) as extras. Even if you've\nseen the original you could really\nenjoy it. The large publicity\ncampaign may also mean you\ncan't avoid it!\nMark Smith\n\n"

Our noble\nPresident, Miss Mary Attenborough e hose to call quorum at the\nlast U GM( March8 th) simply\nbecause she didn't like the motion\nwhich was on the verge of being\npassed. How sickening! The irony\nwas that Mademoiselle Attenborough's election posters\nwere displayed up at the front,\nand the word 'Democracy' was\nprominent on them. She knew\nwhat kind of a Union she was\ngoing to be president of, and she\nstill chose to stand. Simply\nbecause she doesn't approve ol\nwhat the majority of students here\nfeel does not absolve her from\nacting in accordance with those\nwishes. Quorum calling is all good\nfun, but not when it comes from\nthe president. It is a pity that\nsomeone who has proved to be so\nbeneficial to ICU, and has shown\nherself to be genuinely concerned\nwith the welfare of most of her\nsubjects, should be responsible lor\nsuch per lid it y.2. Will nothing placate WTSc. (or\nWIST or PI ST or whatever they\ncall themselves nowadays)!? The\nmale strippers were inserted for\ntheir titillation, but they'll be\npicketing as usual. I presume they\njust like picketing for picketing s sake (maybe they hope to be\npicked up?). II, as I assume, the\nmajority of these pickets are the\ntype that attend the Women's self defence classes your illustrious publication advertises,\nthen I should like to volunteer my\nservices as a would-be assailant. I can guarantee a very realistic\nperformance.\nI have the honour to be Sir, in\neager anticipation ofthe return of\nThe Times, your most obe diem and obsequious servant,\nShlomo Godsi ME II\nDear John, - I feel perhaps that I should say a few things about the\nmany insults, attacks etc\nlaunched at me in last week^\nFELIX. Perhaps 1 will tax e them\nin order of importance.\nFirstly I dislike intensely being\ncalled 'Miss'. I Know that most\npeople do this in order to annoy\nme and I can only admit that it\nsucceeds in doing so. I see no\nreason at all why a woman should\nbe forced to proclaim her marital\nstatus as though it were of prime\nimportance whether or not she\nhas got a 'full time* man. (A woman without a man is like a fish\nwithout a bicycle - to quote my\nfavourite saying). For people who\nfinds Ms. totally un pronoun cable or lor other reasons unacceptable\n( although its accepted for\nregistration at College and for\n... passport purposes) you are\nperfectly entitled to call me Mary. If you feel this is bordering on\nbeing friendly towards me you\ncan always call me \" thingy\". A few people attack me for not\nbehaving the way that a president\nis supposed to. My major problem\nis that I think the concept of a president, as many see it, is\nhierarchical and therefore not\nvery nice. I didn't really realise I didn't agree with the concept of\nbeing president until I was elected\nand I thought that maybe people\nwouldn't notice. As far as I am\nconcerned I am just another\nUnion member who happens to\ndo a full time job for the Union. Contrary to popular belief you get\nabsolutely no privileges (except\nthe odd free dinners) by being\npresident certainly no greater\npower (nor should you do). I therefore object to the fact of\nhaving all the disadvantages of\nbeing president (like working\nmost evenings and bits of\nweekends) and also having my\nrights as a ordinary Union\nmember taken away from me.\nAny Union Member can call\nquorum at a Union meeting and\nalso campaign for someone to be\nelected to any post in the union\n(they can also commit slander as\nlong as they pay their own legal\ncosts).\nII every time someone called\nquorum they went out and did a lot of work to make sure the next\nmeeting to discuss the subject was\nquo rate as I did, I can see no\ngrounds at all for complaint. I certainly don't call quorum\nindiscriminately - in fact once in\nsix \"years - and it was based on a personal decision that such an\nimportant decision - involving the\nissue of vast repression in South\nAfrica, could not be taken at an\nin quo rate meeting.\nMany people challenge quorum just because they are\noo red with a subject and can't be\nbothered to argue it out. I can\nunderstand getting annoyed with\nsomeone in such circumstances - it\nhas happened to motions I support all the time. But I have\nnever been self righteous about\nmy feeling annoyed. Anyone can\ncall quorum whenever they like.\nWe can only ask them to be\nresponsible.\nMark Ciegg is obviously\ncompletely unable to read or pay\nattention to U CM's because I disagreed with the Ireland motion\nenough to have a written\namendment which I spoke to ai\nthe meeting. Furthermore, I am\nnot out of touch with Union members, I just don't necessarily\n#g ree with them! This is not a change. I have always supported\nlost causes at Union meetings -being in a minority position does\nnot frighten me. Surely I have the\nright as a Union member to put\nforward my own personal views as\nlong as my actions as Union President are based on concern\nfor Union policy and as long as I make every possible effort to\ninform the Union of what is being\ndone on their behalf. That is what\nI meant by my election slogans lor\na comp aig ning, democratic and\ninformed Union. I did support an election\ncandidate. I do not believe that\nUnion members are total sheep\nwho follow what\" higher authority\" tells them (and if they\nare it's about time somebody\neducated them out of it). I have\ncampaigned for Presidential\ncandidates for the last 3 v ears(1976 Nigel Miller got 130 votes,\n1977 Peter Chalk got 260 votes\nand me in 1978 got 1023 votes)\nmostly unsuccessfully.\nYours non-hierarchically,\nThingy\nMaths PG Dear Sir, - We would like to make\nour views on South Africa quite\nclear:\n(i) We wouldn't work there\n(ii) Like any fundamental\ninjustice we hope apartheid soon\ncomes to an end.\nWe were obviously glad to sec\nour proposal on job recruitment\npassed at the last U. G.M. However we felt it was not\ninterpreted in the spirit it was\nintended and therefore thought it\nwas necessary to make known the\npoints above.\nYours sincerely,\nMark Clegg\nM. Corrigan\nDear Sir, -1 write to answer Mick Berry's letter in last week's FELIX about I.C. Radio's recent\nprogramme changes. I am\npleased to see that he is\nconcerned, even though he does\nnot agree with our policy. The\nchanges followed many long\ndiscussions (late into the night!)\nwithin the station. We felt the\nspecialist programmes were\ncreating much negative feedback\nwith little positive response.\nBecause our potential audience\nis small, we must be sure that any\nminority programme reaches a large portion of that minority.\nThis did not appear to be\nhappening. For example, Opus\n301, our classical slot, could not\ncompete with the wider scope and\nsuperior sound quality of Radio 3.\nR'n B, disco, heavy metal, and\nU.S. Rock can all be heard in our\ngeneral programming.\nMr. Berry is unfair in calling\nour output \"mindless pop\". The\nstation's presenters have a great\ndeal of individual choice as to\nwhat music they play, and I feel\nthat this gives a far wider range of\nmusical styles than on most other\nBritish radio stations.\nThe station's aims, set out in\nour constitution, are: to provide\nan immediate news service, to\nrelay information of college\nevents, and to entertain hall\nresidents. In order to achieve the\nfirst two of these, we must ii ave a reasonable number of listeners.\nConsequently, our general programmes are directed at the\nwidest audience possible.\nSince the changes, we have\nbeen giving more attention to\ngood non-music programmes,\nsuch as our extensive coverage of\nthe sabbatical elections, and we\nintend to expand further in this\ndirection. Next term we are\nrepeating Capital Radio's excellent documentary \"Bedsit\nJungle\", to help listeners find\na com mod ation next session.\nI hope Mick now understands\nthe reasons for these changes; I would be pleased to discuss any of\nthese points with him if he should\nso wish.\nYours sincerely,\nJohn Allen,\nStation Manager, I.C. Radio\nDear Sir, - It has been brought to\nour attention that blatant discrimination is being practised\nby the College authorities. From deep within us we feel that this\nuncomfortable predicament must\nbe brought to the surface. It\nappears that most of the mens'\ntoilets in college are supplied with\nhard scratchy (and noisy) toilet,\npaper, while most ofthe womens\nare provided with soft, pink, two-ply toilet tissue (except in Botanyare they hardened to it?)\nWe men must not sit idly by\nand let this sexism pass unnoticed.\nLet those of us of as en st ive nature\nstand up and lodge a protest.\nWith the backing of a mass\nmovement a motion could be\npresented to aUG M and an\nattempt made to rectify this harsh\nsituation.\nYours etc.\nN. Morton Biochem PGA. Walker Che mPC Dear Mr. Harris, - One at my\nagents informs me that doubt has\nbeen cast on my existence. I refer,\nof course, to the letter of Jan Czernuszka which appeared in\nyour esteemed organ last week.\nMy existence is beyond doubt,\nand furthermore, when the time is\nright, I shall be swept into power\nby the multitude of my faithful\nsupporters and shall immediately\ninstitute a change in the 'fabric of\nour society'.\nMay such mindless c loons as\nMr. Czernuszka take warning.\nYours in indignation,\nJan Czernuska\nDear Sir, - Rastus has noticed that\nbig white chief John Harris has\nbeen censoring his articles. Big\nwhite chief John Harris had\nbetter stop doing this otherwise he\nwill either;\n(i) be made to play a frame of\nsnooker against Al Leclezio, when\nAl is in one of his better (\"I can't play on this table!

IV v AMALG. DENTAL (Home) 9-0\nA well-drilled fourth team played like a gas\nwith Lambert and Cobrin winning all three\nsets for the first time ever Rutherford of\ncourse did his usual bit.\nI.C. Ill v. BARBICAN Computer Centre II\n(Away) 4-5\nThe match was finally resolved in the 8th set, when I lost2118 in the3 rd game and thus\nleft the score 4-4. As the final match was\nagainst BARBICAN' s top player, the eventual\n4-5 defeat was a formality, though Reed made\na gallant effort. He won one of his three sets,\nStean won two, and me one.\nI.C. II v. EAGLE III (Home) 7-2\nMuch discussion took place on the subject\nof Sobhanpanah's and Ugoala's serves. It was\nresolved (partly) when I commented that one\nof the Eagle players had an equally \"illegal\"\nserve. I.C. eventually won a tense match\nthanks to Farzin (3 sets), Tye (2 sets) and Eze\n(2 sets).\nI.C. IV v.D of E IV (Home) 6-3\nWeng Leong (with my bat!!) pulled off three\ngreat wins and with Lambert (2 wins) and\nCobrin (1 win) ensured victory.\nWell, as this is an end-of-term report here\nare the results of a Universal (one person)\nPoll on my efforts: Sppeling: 98%, Gramma:\nN out, Wit:Less, Sado masochistic tendencies: 3 and a half. Next term, cricket\nreports from Super Smooth?\nI CROSSCOUNTRY For the second time this term the\npresence of IC runners in Cambridge\nhas brought blizzards, on this occasion\nfor the Boundary Run, an annual 26 mile\ntrot around the city, to be completed\nwithin 6 hours.\nThe 153 starters struggled in driving snow\nover a first five miles of ploughed fields before\nhitting roads for the next fifteen miles, all but\nthe leading pack of four taking advantage of\nMars bars supplied at 14 and 19 miles out.\nThe last 6 miles of a marathon are bad\nenough without including a league of muddy\nfields, with fences, ditches and railway lines\nto traverse. Navigational error took its toll,\nrouting arrows having been stolen: our own\nMark Pickard was misdirected onto a short\ncut, taking him to the finish in first place,\nhonesty and a four minute penalty reducing\nhim to 3rd in 2 hrs 48 mins 20 sees. First place\nwas taken by Cambridge's Chris Hirst in\n2.44.20, with M. Ellison one minute behind.\nThe two-man Imperial team was completed\nafter 3.10.06 when Geoff Sherwood,\ndisguised as an icicle, staggered into the finish\nin 7th place, causing the snow to stop in so\ndoing.\nWith the competitive season drawing\nto a close, this is the time of year when\nclubs settle internal rivalries and give\none another trophies, I.C. are no\nexception. Last Wednesday saw the\nannual club 5000m race, held at a windswept and rain lashed West\nLondon Stadium. For several weeks\npast Ian Morton had been making daily\ntrips to the Union Office in order to eye\nup the rather impressive piece of Silver\nwhich the winner holds for one year,\nsuch was his desperate desire to win,\nand so break the domination of recent\nyears by the Physics Dept.\nHe even took his war of nerves to the length\nof a late arrival in order to shatter the spirits\nof his rivals. When the race got underway it\nwas the fast starting Mark Thwaites and Danny Clarke-Lowes who set off at a blistering pace. Soon Stu Littlewood and\nMark Pickard took the lead with Bryan\nAcford and Morton close behind. At the\n2000m mark Acford made his move, (with a notable lack of success) he held the lead for 3\nlaps until Morton skated through, and proceeded to storm onward over the final\n1500 m and eventually slipped and slithered\nhis way to a fine (if lucky) victory in a respectable 16 mins 15 sec. He was followed\nin by Littlewood and Pickard in the \"silver\"\nand \" bronze\" medal positions. Little Ian's delight was somewhat tarnished, however,\nwhen he discovered that he would be\nrequired to fill the cup to its full 6 pint\ncapacity.\nSaturday gave us the annual race against\nthe Old Boys and by 3:30 pm there were a mere 14 individuals at the start. The thought\nof splashing around Richmond Park\nevidently being considerably less attractive\nthan sitting in front ofthe TV watching the\nBoat Race and the Rugby and downing a quiet gallon. As was eventually inevitable,\nhangovers caught upon Ian Morton and he\ndidn't arrive at all. This only served to lift\nAcford's spirits to a previously unknown high\nas he scented a maiden victory. Rich Harrington was obviously of the same\nopinion as he tried to persuade each\ncompetitor, in turn, to give a bit extra and try\nto \" Wobble\" Acford. But the \" Cart horse\" was not to be denied and he steamed off in\nfine style without even pausing to glance\nbehind. Some even claimed to have seen\nsmoke issuing from his ears as he carre ered of l into the distance. Acford was a convincing\nvictor with Ian Isherwod winning the tus tle for 2nd place from the ageing Chris James.\nFourth home was the aforementioned\nHarrington enjoying a glorious swan song. The remaining finishers being, in order, Gary Longhurst, Alf Garnett, Ian Alvey, Dave\nCleator, Maurice Wilson, Dave Briggs, Pete\nJohnson, Martin Tarnowski, Dave Jones and\nfinally Miriam Rosen. The result was rigged\nin order to achieve the traditional draw.\nThis almost marks the end of the season,\nbut for those of you who enjoy shorter\ndistances, the Inter C CU Athletics Championships are being held on Wednesday April25 th at the West London Stadium. Do come along and support your\nC CU, as the standard is pretty low, and a good time is had by all, you may even see\nMark Corrigan in steeplechase action!\nL 'Escargot (again)\nREVIEWS!\nFriday 16th March\nHoist: Hymn of Jesus\nRossini: Petite Messe Solennelle\nIf the last week at IC is any indication, then the music of Gustav Hoist\nis enjoying a vigorous revival, if indeed it has ever been neglected. Last\nweek DramSoc chose for incidental music the best known of Hoist's music, \"The Planets\", and on Wednesday the Wind Ensemble\nprogramme featured more of the music written by this composer.\nOn Friday the IC Choir, under the direction of Professor Eric Brown,\nperformed Hoist's \"Hymn of Jesus\", a piece written only two years after\n\"The Planets\" at the end of the Great War. Despite its origin in such\nturbulent years, the Hymn is calm, reflective and full of sustained voices\nreminiscent of \"Neptune, the mystic\". Its text is a setting of early\nChristian writings, from the \"Apocryphal Acts of St. John\", and was\ntranslated by the composer himself. The piece is dedicated to Ralph\nVaughan Williams, who had also studied under Stanford at the RCM. The Hymn opens with an unaccompanied plainsong melody from a trombone (a solo in this performance rather than the stipulated pair in\nunison). The prominence ofthe trombone is no doubt attributable to the\ncomposer being himself a player of that instrument. On this occasion\nthe orchestra was extremely competent, although the strings had some\ndifficulty with the asymmetrical rhythms at the beginning of \"Divine\nGrace is dancing.\"\nAt times the plainsong themes and the use of a small male semi-chorus evoked a rather monastic atmosphere, but for the most part the\nmusic was luxuriant rather than ascetic, with long high descants (in the\noriginal sense, of a melody sung above the plainsong) and bell-like\nchords from the orchestra. As in many other pieces by this composer,\nthe bass line is predominantly a heavy, treading s cali c descent, a sort of\nanchor which prevents the chorus from drifting away from the Earth\ncompletely.\nThe harmonies employed by Hoist are chromatic, often unusual and\nvery effective. Great beauty is achieved by a careful use of dissonance\nrather than from saccharine consonances. An example is the \"Glory to\nthee, Father\", where the last word is accented and enhanced by first a major chord, and then by one of the most harmonically remote chords\npossible (for those of a technical disposition, the minor triad a triton e distant) as the lower strings plunge into their descending scales.\nThe Rossini piece is an interesting choice for the Choir, since it has a strong emphasis towards the soloists, with few opportunities for the\nchorus to come into the foreground. Perhaps this enabled the Choir to\nsave their energies, since the choruses were very brilliant. This Writer\nwas particularly impressed by the \" Cum Sancto Spiritu\" of the \"Gloria\",\nfor which one could not imagine a finer performance. The soloists were\nhighly competent, and Jeffrey Cresswell's singing of the \"Domine\nDeus\" was particularly enjoyable.\nThe \"Petite Messe Solennelle\" is a piece which I had heard only once\npreviously, and I suspect that it was less familiar to most ofthe audience\nthan Rossini's earlier \"Stabat Mater\". Although Rossini is best known\ntoday as a composer of opera, he also turned out quite a few sacred\npieces. The \"Petite Messe\" is not particularly short, nor is it noticeably\nmore solemn than any of these other pieces. Indeed, the earlier sections\nabound with cheerful little tunes, many of which are thrown away quite\ncasually, which would not have been out of place in any Rossini opera,\nand the Mass only becomes solemn towards what would presumably, in\nliturgical performance, be the actual Celebration. The Choir seemed to\nbe more confident in the conventional harmonies and melodies of\nRossini, and they achieved some beautiful tone with accurate singing,\nright up to the long and intricate final Amen.\nDerrick Everett\n\n"

CHESS CLUB IC Iv ISLINGTON III\nAfter a fine 7-1 victory over Wood Green, the first team travelled up to\nIslington, confident of maintaining its challenge for promotion to the\npremier division next year. On arriving, we discovered that the\nopposition was much weaker than anticipated and so looked forward to\nanother convincing win.\nThe match started well with Chris Callow obtaining a big advantage\nout of the opening on board 6 and Bob Coles, on the board above,\npicking up an extra.pawn by neat tactical play. The opposing captains\nquickly drew a very boring game on board 1 and when Dave Lock\nrefuted an unsound sacrifice the match looked over.\nHowever Islington fought back. On board 4, Shahin Rouhani tried too\nhard to force a win and blundered away a piece and the game. John Freeman fell into a prepared book line, sacrificed un soundly and, in\ntime-trouble, lost his queen. At this point, Islington seemed to have\nchances of saving the match as, on board 3, Pete Anderson was\nstruggling to maintain an equal position and on the bottom board,\nDamian Hassan, although a pawn up, could not break through his\nopponent's defenses.\nFortunately, Pete managed to draw and Bob duly won a fine game\nleaving the match tied at 3-3. As both Chris and Damian have won\npositions, IC look certain to score another victory although not in as\nconvincing style as expected.\nIC Iv CENT YMCA DRAGONS Despite a disappointing performance against Islington, the same\nteam was selected to play against the division 1 leaders. Centymca\nDragons. This was a crucial promotion match with IC needing a win to\nhave any chance of promotion this season.\nAlthough an IC victory seemed unlikely, our chances were enhanced\nwhen the opposition arrived with only 7 players, defaulting on board 7.\nProspects looked even brighter when Bob Coles obtained a position ally won game and Pete Anderson held onto two extra pawns, sacrificed by\nhis opponent, without obtaining an inferior position. On board 6, Chris\nCallow was forced to accept a draw by perpetual check and Dave Lock,\npromoted to board 4, drew quickly, missing a simple win on the way.\nJohn Freeman recovered his early season good form and smashed up\nthe London U10(!) champion, N. Carr, on board 2, accepting all his\nopponent's sacrifices on the King-side and then destroying him on the\nQueenside. (Carr was handicapped by his size, being unable to reach\npast the fourth rank). On the top board, Phil Maguire lost a pawn to a strong opponent and, although managing to survive a wild time-scramble, was never able to overcome this material deficit.\nMeanwhile Pete Anderson had converted his advantage to a win but\nBob Coles had erred and was fighting for a draw. Damian Hassan, on the\nbottom board, was also struggling in a difficult position and by the\nadjournment the match was poised 4-2 in IC s favour, with Bob and\nDamian still to finish. A draw from either game would secure victory for\nIC and leave the team with a good chance of promotion to the Premier\nDivision.\nP.

Just in case you aren't convinced enough that this action is necessary I thought I'd better include an account of the Great Refectory Pricing Saga.\nThe story really starts, from my point of view, back in December\n1978, when it was recommended by the Refectory Committee there\nshould be a2% price increase in the refectories. Prior to that us students\nhad been revolting (not half as much as the food), and complaining\nabout the high price for the quality. Union policy had been passed that\nthe Union representatives on the Refectory Committee should accept\nno price increases until the quality ofthe food was improved. So, we\nstarted to complain and a rather brilliant paper was presented to the\nRector about the proposed price increase. It was then that we realised\nthat there was something very much up with the regulator. According\nto the minutes ofthe Refectory Committee and Governing Body the\nregulator was only supposed to cover food cost increases and yet, the\nentirety ofthe financial Times Grocery Index increase was added on to\nour food prices every month. This seems strange considering that food\nonly constitutes approximately 56% of cost to the Refectory account.\nWe used it as one part ofthe argument against the proposed 2% termly\nreview increase to go on from the l st January, and on that occasion we\nwon and no extra increase was incurred that month.\nIt seems now that this was just one small move to fob off students from\ncomplaining too much. Unfortunately, from the College point of view,\nit did not succeed. We wanted a discussion on the use ofthe regulator\nand tried to push lor one at Refectory Committee. However, Professor\nEilon. who doesn't like the idea of consumers having any say in pricing\nin the refectories whatsoever, refused to allow a discussion actually at\nRefectory Committee and instigated instead a discussion at Refectory\nFinance Sub-committee and then, presumably in an attempt to go over\nthe heads of'the Committee altogether referred it to the Rector, which\nled to the discussion at the Finance and Executive Committees ofthe\nCollege. At Finance and Executive Committees we put our case\nforward that the regulator was only ever meant to cover food cost\nincreases and it had, in fact, been misapplied in the past. We argued\nthat the regulator could only be sensibly used to cover food cost\nincreases and further more we had to argue against a move, proposed to\nthat Committee, that all pricing control should be taken out of the\nhands of the Refectory Committee. Such a move would have been the\nend of any possibility of democratic say for students. The proposals\ncoming out of that Committee were not too bad. They were that the\nRefectory Committee should have a discussion upon the type of\nregulator to be used, but that the regulator should cover food cost\nincreases and other regular increases to the Refectory account. This\nwould be in association with proper term lv reviews of refectory prices.\nThe understanding being that it was possible for refectory prices to go\ndown as well as up in such reviews.\nBeing naive, the student representatives on the Refectory Committee\nexpected that there would be a full discussion on the use of the regulator\nheld at Refectory Committee. We should have realised there was\nsomething up Professor Eilon's sleeve. He allowed us to support the\nproposal to have two parts ofthe regulator. A two-tier regulator seemed\nmore sensible to us. as we'd been told by F'inance and Executive\nCommittees that wages had to be taken into account, as one could have\none section to account for food price increases and another part to\naccount for wage increases which could be based on current\nexpectations. A vote was taken at the Committee as to whether we\nshould have the old regulator based on the full increase ofthe Financial\nTimes Grocery Index or whether we should have the new regulator\nwhich would be 60% of the Financial Times Grocery Index plus a constant element to take account of wage cost increases. We voted for\nthe second naturally assuming that any clement to take account of wage\ncost increases would only be a small one. That was when Professor Eilon\npulled the final rabbit out of his hat and said that it was not up to us to\ndecide what the wages element should be, that was just administrative\naction. He then announced, verbally only, a long argument on how he\nproposed to justify a1% prices increase per month on top ofthe food\nelement increase to the refectory prices. We were astounded and\namazed, realising that this could lead to something near a10% increase\nin prices by the end of this financial year. Eilon was obviously\noverjoyed, believing that he'd won the final battle to put down any\nopposition to his views. The final insult came when he then proposed\nthat he would not suggest any increase in the termly review that term.\nThis was not particularly surprising, seeing as how he had just ensured\nthat the refectory account would certainly end with a vast profit for this\nsession.\nWe didn't panic immediately (much) because we believed that no\nway could the Rector possibly agree to this scheme. I went to see the\nRector and also quickly prepared a paper which would take into\naccount an 8% expected wage rise during the year (which is what the\nUniversity Grants Committee had allowed for as an estimate for this\nyear). I adjusted my paper because I realised that initially I had not\ntaken into account that there are two things that you need to cover in\nterms of refectory income and refectory prices. The income is needed to\ncover the overall increased costs during the year and the price is needed\nto match up to the current costs ofthe meal at the end of any particular\nyear. It is therefore very difficult to take account of a discreet rise in cost\nwhich comes about on the date of a wage settlement. I proposed that a0.2. increase per month, with an adjustment of a1.3% increase at the\nbeginning ofthe financial year would totally cover an 8% increase in\nwages cost (assuming that wages in fact account for 43% of refectory\ncosts). As you can see from this calculation even a16% wage increase\ncould be accounted by a0.4% increase in refectory cost per month.\nDespite this well-argued case that has been put forward. College is\nsticking to the idea that there is going to be a20% increase in labour\ncosts, which can only be accounted for by this 1% increase per month.\nThe20% increase in labour costs is based on the total increase in labour\ncost over last year's account, and does not take into account that there\nhas been a16% increase in cash turnover in that period. The argument\nbeing put forward is rather similar to that of saying that if the amount of\nchips bought by the refectory doubles then the cost of chips should be\ndoubled to take account of the increased chip cost to the refectory\naccount.\nAs if all this had not been enough not only was the new regulator\napproved by the Rector but it has also been backdated to take account\nof the January increase in the Financial Times Grocery Index and to\nadd on 1% for each ofthe months of February and March. This means\nthat there was a4% increase in refectory prices on March15 th. Following is an outline ofthe increases we have met this year so far.\n1. A4% increase on the l st August, 1978.\n2. A1.9% increase on the l st December, 1978 (to take account ofthe\ntotal of the Financial Times Grocery Index increase during November).\n3. A1.4% increase on the l st January, 1979 (to take account ofthe total\nFinancial Times Gorcery Index increase during December).\n4. A4% increase on the 15th March,1979( broken down as follows - 60%\nof the Financial Times Grocery Index increase during January equals\n60% x3.3 which equals 2% plus 1% wages element increase for that\nmonth plus 60% of Financial Times Grocery Index increase for\nFebruary, which was only 0.1 % so they ignored it plus 1 % wages element\nincrease lor February.\nI think everyone must agree that price increases have been excessive\nthis year and that we cannot accept increases that go on in this way. As\nany other consumer group we have the right to voice a protest and this\nwe are doing by boycotting the refectories. The Union Meeting on the\n15th March decided by an overwhelming majority to carry on with an\nall-out boycott ol the refectories from the beginning of next term. Please\nsupport the boycott.\nThe other decision made was to pull out ol \" Meet Imperial College'\nil the Executive so decided. Because the voting on this was relatively\nclose, (something like 170 to 130 votes), I felt we should have another\ndiscussion on this issue, before finally taking the step, which we will do\non Thursday, 26th April, at a Union meeting to be held in the\nConcert Hall. Meanwhile, keep on boycotting.

The rate for a 'Householder' is \u00a315.55 per week,\nand not \u00a312.45 per week. A householder is someone who is\nresponsible for the outgoing s incurred in his accommodation\ne.g. heating, lighting or telephone bills. If you are a 'householder'\nand claiming for.rent over the\nvacation, you could get \u00a315.55\nplus your rent less \u00a313.90 vacation\nelement. Bearing in mind that the\nnon-householder rate is \u00a312.45\nper week, it would seem worthwhile to press the D.H.S. S. to accept you as a householder. It\nis complicated, however, by the\nfact that there is no official\ndefinition of a householder so it is\na question of arguing it out. With\nthe D.H.S.

    "content": "Issue No. 514 Friday. 23rd March. 1979\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE TOTAL BOYCOTT!\nStudents Urged to Eat Elsewhere Next Term\nThe Union is mounting a continuous boycott of all College\nstudent refectories from the start of next term.\nThis drastic action is a Union Meeting's response to the\nlatest 4 per cent price rise and the certainty of large monthly\nprice increases to follow.\nAn Emergency Union Meeting to be held on the first\nThursday next term will also consider a proposal to withdraw\nUnion cooperation from College's\" Meet IC\" day.\nThe Union Executive has made no firm plans for the provision of\nalternative food but was waiting to see the response to yesterday's boycott. They are urging all students to arrange to eat outside College\nor bring sandwiches. Lists of restaurants near College will be available.\nFaced with the prospect of a10 College might have done better\nper cent refectory price rise in 5 to close these as well, for very few-months and the constant refusal of\nCollege to consider the Union's views, the Union Meeting decided that an all-out boycott\nwas the only way left to force\nCollege to listen to the students.\nThe success of the action now\ndepends on all students observing\nthe boycott.\nThe\" Meet IC\" day, to be held\non 2nd May, is being organised by\nCollege to improve . relations\nbetween College and the local\ncommunity. About 300 local\nresidents will be invited to see the\nCollege and several Union Societies have been asked to\nprovide exhibits. There will also\nbe a social meeting between the\nvisitors and stall'and students.\nUnion President Mary Attenborough has already written to the societies involved\nasking them to consider withdrawing from the scheme if\nthe Union Meeting decides not to\nparticipate. Several Union activists believe that College\nwould be very annoyed by\nstudent noncooperation.\nIn response to yesterday's one-da)' boycott of all refectories\nCollege closed Southside refectory during lunch and\nsupper, leaving only three\nrefectories for the Union to picket.\nlunches were served. By 1.30 pm\nonly 17 customers had entered the\nUnion refectory and an alternative food service was doing\nwell.\nThe Sherfield Buttery was\ndeserted except for one customer\nat 12.30, normally the peak lunch\ntime period. In contrast a long-queue had formed for Union provided alternative food in the\nJunior Common Room. Departmental Representative\nChris Hunt reported that he had\ntaken over \u00a350 for food such as\nsausages and hamburgers. His\ncomment: \"It is busier than\nSainsbury's\". Downstairs in the Sherfield\nLower Refectory only 6 people\nwere eating at 1.10 p.m. A lew\nmore bad got in earlier due to a slow start to picketing at 12.00.\nbut Union Secretary Mike Elkin\nsaid that only 12 people had got\npast him at one door of the\nrefectory. Kir s len Pratt picketing\nat the main Consort Gallery\nentrance said that most people\nhad been turned away.\nThe one-day boycott has been a great success, exceeding ail but\nthe most optimistic predictions\nand there now is every indication\nthat next term's continuous\nboycott will be successful.\nThe Union Lower Refectory at 1.15 pm during yesterday's boycott\nCOUNCIL REPORT The Union is asking College to buy more houses for student\naccommodation and to set up head tenancy schemes.\nIC Union Council, meeting on Monday, heard that the University\nGrants Committee is unable to give College any more money for\naccommodation. The meeting passed a motion asking College to use\nany money available for investment to purchase the freehold or\nleasehold of houses and suggested that College could use Housing\nCorporation finance to build or convert property through a Housing\nAssociation.\nCollege is considering taking up a head tenancy in property in\nLexham Gardens. Council empowered the Union Executive to enter\nsuch a scheme on the Union's behalf if College cannot be persuaded to\ngo ahead.\nPosts Filled\nFollowing Sheyne Lucock's resignation Council elected John\nPassmore as Acting External Affairs Officer. John Passmore has\nalready been elected External Affairs Officer for next year in a vote at\nlast week's Union Meeting.\nDeputy President Malcolm Brain is to fill the posts of Council\nChairman and student representative on College's Governing Body,\n.con td. on back page\n\n"

What you are about to read is an extremely rare 'Societies Page'\narticle from the CONSERVATIVE SOCIETY.... and what better subject\nto write one about than the Consoc. A.G.M.. which was held on Tuesday\n20th March. In addition to 14 Consoc. members was Gilly Gillespie, the\nLondon Conservative Students Chairwoman/person/man who arrived\nlate thanks to the architect who designed the three-dimensional maze\ncalled Huxley Building.\nTo kick off, the minutes and various committee members' reports\nwere disposed off with the exception of the Treasure's report which was\ndeferred to a later meeting - probably only to confirm that Consoc. is\nflat broke. Well not every society can afford massive College-wide\nwall poster campaigns and huge recruitment drives, especially when as\nin our society, the claims by last year's Publicity Officer meant that part\nof last year's expenses were added to this year's. Next on the agenda was the extremely important elections of next\nyear's committee and just when most people had the impression that for\nthe fourth A.G.M. in succession all the posts would be unopposed it was\nrevealed that we have a contested \"Morning Cloud' editorship post\nbetween the absent Nick Griffin and John Narborough. By scrawling on\nbits of computer paper kindly donated by Stephen Poley, our present\nChairman, the voters elected John Narborough by a majority of 8 to 5 to\nfill the post. The rest of the candidates were ratified, though the doctor\nsaid it wasn't serious, and are as follows: -Chairman Mark Clegg\nVice Chairman Robert Gould\nSecretary Sally Heslop\nTreasurer Tim Lawes\nSadly, nobody wanted to take the post of Publicity Officer, currently\nheld by me. There were rumours that Shlomo Godsi was wanting to\nstand but since neither did he appear in person nor was his name on the\nnominations paper the post was left vacant. So if you, Shlomo, or\nanyone else out there wants to stick up posters (Blu tac supplied) and\nwrite the (very) odd article for FELIX then just let our chairman know.\nTwo members. Sally Heslop and Chris Webb made it known that they\nwished to attend the Federation of Conservative Students annual\nConference in Liverpool and since nobody present minded them each\nspending \u00a320 of SCO money, they were ratified to be our delegates.\nOur Chairman, Stephen Poley then wafted about a rather thick wad of\nprinted sheets (printed on both sides so they can't be used for rough\npaper) which constituted the motions submitted to the F.C.S. Annual\nConference. His suggestion that the examination of these motions, in\nview of voting in the priorities ballot, be deferred to a meeting of the\ndelegates and any interested members of the executive was- gladly\naccepted.\nUnfortunately, the current Publicity Officer had to leave early in order\nto attend a lecture on immuno pathology, thus maintaining his (World?)\nrecord of only missing th re( yes three) lectures in the three years he ji as been at I.C.I On that note which is not entirely relevant to the article Twill\nconclude, thanks for reading it. Love and best wishes,\nMartin Sladdin\nc OFFICIAL NOTICE\nOfficial notice to the members\nof the Royal College of Science\n(especially those with lots of\nmoney they don't want)\nTickets for the Royal College of\nScience Annual Ball to be held at\nSilwood Park on the 11th of May\n1979 are to be put on sale to\nmembers of the Royal College of\nScience Union ONLY on Friday\nApril 27th.

Hurry before they are all\nsold out.\nCOMMUNITY\nACTION\nGROUP\nJust a little article this week as\nthere isn'ta great deal to say at the\nmoment, Easter and all that.\nThe only bit of real information\nis that Simon Chandler has\ndecided to take on the job of Red\nCross volunteer co-or d in at or. This will be the job of organizing\nhospital visiting, trolly shops and\nthe like, as the college Red Cross\nDetachment has mountains of\nrequests for such volunteers but\nhasn't the organization to fill them\nat the moment. Therefore in future\nthis branch of community action\nwill be looked after by them.\nI would also like to use this\nspace to gripe on how no-one\nturned up on Sunday morning to\nhelp paint the \"providence Row\"\nplace. I suppose with it being\nSunday morning with the clocks\njust having come forward it was all\nthat could be expected but at the\nsame time there was quite a reasonable turn out from the\nCatholic Chaplaincy at More\nHouse.\nOh Well, see you all next term,\nunless there's a soup run tonight.\nBye,\nJohn Whitehouse Chem PG.\nint 4162.\nThe Annual Inter C CU Small\nBore Rille Competition For The\nCourtman Shield was recently\nheld at the Rifle Range in The\nSports Centre.

It is\nnot light entertainment, but\ndefinitely needs to be sat down\nand listened to. That's not to say\nthat it won't set your feet tapping,\nfingers strumming, head nodding,\nshoulders rolling, or whatever\nappreciative body movement\nhappens to be your own personal\nper ference. The most obvious strength of\nthe album is the drumming,\nwhich comes from Mike Kellie\nwho played for Spooky Tooth in\nthe late sixties and early seventies.\nThis carries you through every\ntrack, keeping the beat, steady yet\nwith infinite variations, in perfect\ntime with the bass player Alan Mair. Together they lay down an\nintense and tight rhythm, out of\nwhich naturally grow the riffs\nfrom John Perry's lead guitar,\nwhich ride alongside, and blend\ninto the basic ry th m, rather than\nbeing awkward additions to the\ntun c, slapped on to show off the\ndexterity of the guitar player, as\nso often seems to happen.\nThe greatest weakness of the\ngroup must be Peter Perrett's voice, and although he admirably\nsucceeds in creating the most\ngloomy and morbid of moods,\nwhich matches the depressing\nlyrical content of his songs\nperfectly, (this is largely because\nhis voice sounds as though he has\nrecently swallowed a cheese-grater) singing is not Mr. Perrett's forte. The range of notes that he\nappears to find easily attainable is\nlimited to about three, although\nwhen he does attempt to exceed\nthis range it tends to put your\nteeth on edge. Having said that,\nthe effect of Mr.Perrett's singing is\ngreatly enhanced when some\npleasing, though occasional,\nharmonies are introduced.\nII you ever heard the Only Ones' last single - \" You' ve got to\npay\".- don't be put oil'; it must be\nthe weakest track on the album,\nand why it was ever chosen is a mystery as there is one particular\ntrack - \" Out there in the night\" -which just screams out to be the\nnext single.\nAlthough \"Serpents\" is by no\nmeans a Classic it is well worth\ntrying to get hold of a copy and\nplaying it through a couple ol\ntimes.\nChris Watts\nP.S. It grows on you.\n\"Travesties\" by Tom Stoppard\nImperial College Dramatic Society\nTom Stoppard's plays, with their\ntechniques of pastiche, controlled absurdity\nand intricate double entendre are ideal\nmaterial for Dramsoc, and well suited to a college audience. Ross Darling's production\nof \"Travesties\" illustrates this perfectly. Its\nsmall, well-rehearsed cast makes this one of\nthe best Dramsoc plays I have seen.\nThe play is a collage of distorted scraps\nfrom the memory of Henry Wilfred Carr.\nInvalided out of war service in 1917 by a gaping wound in his otherwise immaculate\nattire, Carr had recuperated in Zurich under\nthe auspices of the British Consulate.\nObsessed by sartorial trivia he now recounts\nhis meetings, real and imagined, with James\nJoyce, Tristan Tzara and Lenin.\nThis framework presents a vehicle for one\nof Tom Stoppard's favourite devices;\nrepeating sections of dialogue almost in\nentirety, but with subtle differences. In\n\"Travesties\" the idea is taken further. These\nare branching-points in the narrative,\nparticular lines which act as common\nbegin ni ngs for many totally different versions\nof the same scene. It is soon impossible to say\nwhich versions are true (if any), and which are\nprojections of Carr's own imagination or\ndesires. The story is unfolded using a wide\nrange of methods including farce, striptease,\nmock Shakespearian drama, limericks, doggerel and even a \"Mastermind\" type quiz.\nThe whole production was rather stylish\nwithout being over-elaborate. Music was\nfrom sources as diverse as Beethoven, Hoist\nand The Temperence Seven. The slide\nProjector which caused such drastic bathos\nin \" Macbeth\", Dram soc's previous production, was here used efficiently to\nprovide film-style opening credits. Cast,\nlighting and sound effects were all really well-rehearsed, the occasional stumble in the\ndialogue being the only slight criticism. The\ncavorting dance towards the end was\nabsolutely hilarious and must have taken a lot\nof practice.\nGraham Brand as Henry Carr made a basically good job of a hard role. It must be\ndaunting for a student to portray old age in\nthe absence of latex makeup, but apart from a few distracting hand and eye movements and\nnervous gestures. Graham's Henry Carr\npassed from senility to youth with, at times,\nstartling effect. Bennett, the supercilious and\nsecretly radical butler was portrayed with\nsuitable emotion less, lofty indifference by\nMark Hope, Mark Wiszewaty gave a really\nfunny performance as James Joyce, equipped with a consistent but not\nexaggerated Irish accent. The rigid\ndialectical approach of Lenin (Mike O' Brien)\nwas well contrasted with the extravagant\nrandomness of the Dadaist, Tzara (Mark\nRobinson - well acted). Isobel Beames as\nGwendolen acted with her usual skill, and\nKaren Webb as Cecily survived her ageing\nprocess beautifully. Nadya (Victoria Scott)\nnarrated her section clearly.\nThe audience (which enjoyed the show as\nmuch as the cast seemed to) was adequate,\nbut should have been much larger,\nconsidering the quality of the production and\nthe low price of 75 p.\"77?e clever people try to impose a design\non the world and when it goes calamitous ly wrong they call it fate. In point of fact,\neverything is chance, including design\nthe causes we know everything about depend\non causes we know absolutely nothing about.\nAnd it is the duty of the artist to jeer and howl\nand belch at the delusion that infinite\ngenerations of real effects can be inferred\nfrom the gross expression ot apparent\ncause\".\n- Tristan Tzara From \"Travesties\" by Tom\nStoppard.\nPaul Williams Physics II\n\n"
