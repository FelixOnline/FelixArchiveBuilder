The\nscriptwriter's unfair trick of writing\na cliffhanger and then producing an\nace, generally a re-write in the next\nepisode is employed several times\nin the course of this story.\nShakespeare finds himself in a tight corner, writes his way in, and\nthen shows us a secret exit, in the\nform of a new character. Bad\nplanning followed by inventiveness\nmaybe, but the story is good enough\nall the same, and it goes like this.\nCinventio, the Duke, takes his\nleave of Vienna and puts Angelo in\nthe driving seat for a while. Angelo,\none of the moral majority, invokes\nstrict laws concerning common\ndecency, and as a result imprisons\nClaudio for the common indecency\nof getting his fiancee pregnant.\nClaudio has a friend, Lucio, who\nalso claims to have a bastard\nsomewhere, and not wishing to see\nthe downfall of his soul mate agrees\nto seek help.

Why is there a review of a cook book in the Arts\npages? Is Yishu Nanda taking over\nthe entire paper?\nI can give you the answer to the\nfirst two questions, but as for the\nlast\u2014I just don't know.\nThis is a very good book. It is\nparticularly aimed at a market of\nnovice cooks/vegetarians, which\nmust include a lot of students, and\nhence qualifies me to write the\nreview. It contains a wide range of\nsimple, quick to prepare, tasty\nrecipes, as well as plenty of useful\nadvice on the basics of cooking it all.\nThere are also a few wacky recipes\ncontaining substances such as\nwake m, whatever that may be, if\nyou're feeling a wee bit\nadventurous. The author also uses\na system of simple notation for\nvarious aspects of each recipe, such\nstops short of joining a nunnery to\nvisit Angelo and plead for Claudio's life. Angelo, being the considerate\nblok e he is, suggests a deal be\nstruck, swapping Claudio's neck for\nIsabella's virginity. It's a tough ie but\nshe refuses, knowing her brother\nwill face death like a man. He takes\nthe news badly though.\nEpisode two. The Duke reappears\nin disguise, and uncovers all this\nterrible double dealing. Enter\nas length of preparation time,\nfree z ability, and suitability for\nvegans (this gets a thumbs up from\nthe 'right-on' lobby), which I found\nvery clear and useful.\nOn the minus side, I feel that Mrs\nElliot sometimes does make things\na little too simplistic, particularly\nwith the varieties of ingredients that\nare used, but this is only a small\nquibble. The book is solidly aimed\nat a market, and it fulfills that aim\nvery well indeed. For me, it means\nthat I will no longer have to ring my\nmother ten minutes before a girl is\ndue to arrive for a romantic te tea te te to find out how long to cook the\nbroccoli. For you, if you want a good, simple cookbook that you will\nuse a lot: you'll be pushed to find\nbetter.\nAlan Young.\nMariana. Who? She's Angelo's deserted fiancee, our first invented\ncharacter. The Duke persuades\nIsabella to agree to Angelo's filthy\nsuggestions and let Mariana then go\nin her place. Angelo demands to see\nClaudio's head the next morning, all\nthe same.\nEpisode three. Enter Bernadine.\nWho now? He is also to be executed\nthat day, and his head sent in place\nof Claudio's to fool Angelo.\nStudy for\nSurvival and\nSuccess\nS Meredeen, PCP Publishing Ltd.\nMost people survive College one\nway or another, finding their feet in\ntheir own way and in their own\ntime. So what is the point of a book\nthat tells you how to go about it? Is\nit really going to be of any use\nespecially when it deals with\nsubjects such as 'The College\nExperience', 'Pass Those Exams\u2014\nAnd Stay Human' and 'Sex, Love\nand Dreams'!?\nWhilst this book does tend to state\nthe obvious at times it sets out in a simple, readable format many of the\nproblems Joe Student can expect to\ncome across in his or her years at\nCollege. It starts out with a general\nintroduction to what College and\nthe people there can do to, or for,\nyou and then continues with\naccommodation, subjects and\noptions, time management and\ngenerally gives tips on how to get\nUnfortunately, he refuses to be\nexecuted and returns to his cell.\nDamn! We need a third new\ncharacter, Ragozine, a pirate who,\nluckily, died that morning anyway.\nAt last we can finish everything\noff tidily, with no new players to be\nseen. The Duke reveals himself and\ndishes out all the true justice he can,\nmeasure for measure.\nThe play spends its first half\nheading on what is certain to be the\npath towards a tragedy. The clever\nplot of the Duke turns this into a comedy however, and despite a sad\nrebuttal of the Duke at the end, as\na whole the play is amusing and\nhappily entertaining.\nThe acting is excellent all round,\nparticularly the portrayal of the\nDuke by Roger Allan. Josette Simon\n(Isabella) and John Shrapnell\n(Angelo) are outstanding and had\nthe entire audience enthralled.\nThe setting is somewhat\nconfusing, being approximately turn\nof the century. A number of\nanachronisms\u2014office furniture,\npunk clothing, a Bic disposable pen,\nair conditioning pipes\u2014make the\nwhole production a touch puzzling\nthough. Perhaps it is meant as an\nindication of the timelessness of the\nmoral of the piece, whatever that\nmay be. Well, perhaps?\nI can thoroughly recommend this\nas a good night out. It's easy to\nfollow and, at \u00a35 for student stand-by, pretty cheap too.\nAndrew Clarke.\nthe most out of all aspects of\nuniversity life.\nIt is all obvious enough when\nyou've read it but then again the\nsame can be said for most things in\nlife and to have a book which\nconcisely points this out is useful.\nWritten in a note format it is the sort\nof book that can be dipped into\nwhen required rather than a textbook in which finding the\ninformation is a task in itself. It also\nhas useful suggestions for further\nreading if needs require.\nFor any student who likes to have\nan organised life and for whom\nproblems can be a problem this book\nis well worth looking at. Those who\ncouldn't care less and sail on\nwithout ever seeming to worry\nabout anything will probably not\nhave read this far into the review\nand so will survive anyway.\nPage 10 FELIX October 14 1988\n\n"

The delay is unacceptable and has, I know, caused hardship and inconvenience.\nStrange as it may seem, more man hours are\nneeded to refund a \u00a350 deposit than to issue a \u00a3500 rent bill. This is because so many different\nthings need to be checked before refunds are\nmade. And a lot of people are involved in the\nprocess: housekeepers, wardens, the residence\noffice surveyors over head ten e an cy dilapidation s, the gas and electricity boards for\nmeter readings, and ultimately the finance office\nstaff to check that all out sanding bills have been\npaid and to produce the refund cheques\nthemselves. This all takes time, and we are\nfrankly not well geared up for the operation at\npresent.\nWe will be looking at the problem in detail at\nour next Students Residence Committee meeting.\nIn the meantime, I believe that we have now\nrefunded all the deposits due to last term's residents. We are holding a few cheques in the\nresidence finance office (Sherfield, room 401),\nawaiting forwarding addresses. I hope that\nanyone who has not yet received their refund\nfrom last term will come forward (after checking\ntheir departmental pigeonhole, please).\nRefund of summer vacation deposits will take\na while longer yet.

As the representative of the UK at this\nconference, I spent eight exciting days with thirty\nstudents from thirteen other countries. In\nbetween partying, skiing, wine tasting and\nsightseeing we held discussions on how\nEuropean students would be integrated in\npreparation for 1992. We founded BEST and\nthrough it aim to facilitate exchange programmes\nfor academic work and vacation work experience\nthroughout Europe.\nThe Eindoven University of Technology,\nHolland is host for this next conference.

It is a little on the high side I feel.\nLast year, the portions became a little sparse\ntowards the end of Norman's reign and the prices\nwent up. This year, the prices are even higher\n(horrendously so) and the portions virtually non-existant. I am aware that the Snack Bar made a trading loss last year (until it was shut down),\nbut I can see no reason for the Union to try and\nregain all of that loss in the first term!\nOne advantage I have noticed is that there are\nmuch smaller queues and the area is more\nsparsely populated than it ever used to be.\nUnfortunately, this is as a direct result of the costs\nin eating there; you can get much bigger portions\nfor less money at any of the other College outlets.\nLet's not forget the Snack Bar is owned by the\nUnion for use by us humble and poorly funded\nstudents. Bring down the prices so that we can\nafford to eat at our own catering outlet.\nYours,\nSteve Killmurray, Physics 3\nCath Maxwell, Physics 2\nSimon Bichara, DoC 2\nZoe Hettinger, DoC 1\nRampant\nDear Bill,\nWith materialism at present being rampant I wonder how many gr duat es this year will go for\nhigh paid jobs in commerce and finance on the\nget quick rich hype when this is their sole interest.\nIn ten years time many of these people will be\ndisillusioned and interested only in acquiring\nmore and more. Job satisfaction depends on\ninterest and enjoyment in what one does,\nachievement as well as financial reward. Is this\nemigration from science and engineering purely\nbecause of higher salaries elsewhere or is it\nbecause the teaching of science and engineering\nand the promotion of careers in this area is so\ninadequate that students motivation to pursue a career in this field is rather low? Whatever the\nreasons, the implications for the country's economy in the future is serious. As for\nmaterialism:\n\"The love of money is the root of all evil' (1 Tim\n6vl0). Does this accurately portray our current\nsociety?\nDave Thomas.\nHello kiddies!\nDear Bill,\nI think your readers may be interested to know\nthe happy ending to the STA Travel saga,\nrecounted in your last issue.\nThe agreement has now been signed by both\nthe College and the Union, and building work\nto convert the former Sports Shop area will be\nstarting shortly. The deal will provide roughly\ndouble the present level of income, all accruing\nto the Union. The College gains no direct financial\nbenefit, but STA have promised to provide a good\nquality business travel service for academic staff\ntravelling on lecture tours, conference visits etc,\nalongside their existing cut-price service aimed\nat the; student market.\nThe contract is in exactly the form proposed by\nme on 22 September.

It\ncould have been just a routine piece\nof mindless Americana, but the fact\nthat it isn't is a credit to an excellent\nscript, smoothly running direction\nand some truly inspired casting.\nRobert De Niro plays a bounty\nhunter undertaking what he\nbelieves to be a simple assignment\u2014for $100,000 he has to return\na bail-jumping accountant, played\"\nby Charles Grodin (Ishtar, Woman in\nRed), to Los Angeles. If all goes well\nthis would take just one night, a 'midnight run'. However, after the\nmild mannered Grodin talks De\nNiro out of a quick plane journey,\nthey have to contend with more\ncumbersome modes of transport to\nget from New York to LA. What\nfollows is a hilarious trek across\nAmerica, and madcap chases\ninvolving the FBI, The Mafia and a rival bounty hunter, who all want\ntheir hands on the accountant.\nA Fish\nCalled Wanda\nCert 15, Plaza Piccadilly.\nOne of the most satisfying films of\nthe year must be A Fish Called\nWanda, which manages to present\nan amalgam of past and present\ncomedy styles.\nAfter the disastrous flop in the\nStates of Clockwise, John Cleese took\ntime out to get the formula right\u2014a comedy that would appeal to both\nthe Americans and the British. The\nresult is so perfect that I can't see\nanyone not liking the film.\nCleese plays barrister Archie\nLeach, whose skills are required to\nfree George, the leader of a London\ngang of jewel thieves, and the only\none of the crooked quartet who\nactually knows where the gems are\nstashed. Archie Leach finds himself\nbeing seduced by Wanda Garshwitz\n(Jamie Lee Curtis), and relentlessly\nhounded by Otto (Kevin Kline),\nWanda's jealous bed-mate. The two\nare members of the gang hoping\nthat Leach would lead them to the\njewels. The fourth member of the\ngang is Ken Pile (Michael Palin), an\nanimal loving hit man.\nThe plot meanders between these\ncharacters, as they try to double-and triple-cross each other to get to\nthe jewels. Much of the intrigue and\nDe Niro: 'Ha! You can't catch me'\nGrodin and De Niro are perfect\ncomic sparring partners, delivering\neach other subtle blows of\nunderstated humour, Grodin's deadpan delivery and sarcastic tone\nsuit his character so well that it is\ndifficult to see anyone else playing\nthe part. It's nice to see Charles\nGrodin getting the recognition he\ndeserves after wallowing in\nan on imi ty for so long.\nMany would question Robert De\nNiro's wisdom in playing a role\nsuch as this, but 'the master of the\nmethod' doesn't put a foot wrong,\nand now has proved that he can\nmake any role his own.\nIn addition to the two leads,\nYaphet Kotto (Alien, Running Man)\noffers good support as an inept FBI\nagent, who thinks he's really cool,\nbut manages to always stay one step\nbehind the rest.\nSome solid yet fast moving\ndirection from Martin Brest (Beverly\nHills Cop) results in\" a good,\nentertaining film.\nSumit Guha.\nKevin Kline feeds Michael Palin some fish and chips\nhumour lies in the interplay and\ndiversity of the four main\ncharacters. Cleese is the respectable\nlawyer, bored with his life, tired of\nbeing British and finding a release\nin the form of Wanda. Wanda\nseduces everyone in sight to try and\nget hold of the jewels. Ken Pile is a chronic stutterer, given the job of\n'doing away with' a little old lady\nwho witnessed the crime, but to his\nanguish he disposes of her three\ndogs instead. But the most over-the-top performance comes from Kevin\nKline, the unstable ex-CIA man\nOtto, who hates the British, 'they\nget rigor mortis in the prime of life\nhere', exclaims the man who thinks\nthe London Underground is a political movement, and reads the\nworks of the well known Belgian\nphilosopher Aristotle!\nThe comparisons between the\nEnglish and the Americans furnish\nmany of the best moments and\ncomplement a very solid plot.\nIt has been said that this film has\nresurrected the style of the Ealing\ncomedies of the sixties. If Ealing\ncomedies were ever this good they\nwould never have died out.\nSumit Guha.\ntrack 29\nMetro (Piccadilly Circus tube)\nA strange and confusing film which\nserves up some interesting\nmoments but becomes lost in its\nown intricacies and attempts at\nexploring the human mind.\nA North Carolina geriatric ian, Christopher Lloyd (Back to the\nFuture, Taxi), is so obsessed with his\nmodel train set that he ignores the\nsexual pleas of his wife Theresa\nRussell (Black Widow). She is saved\nfrom suicide by the appearance of\na crazy Englishman, Gary Oldman,\nwho claims to be her long lost son.\nFiery arguments and sexual\ninnuendoes follow as Russell\nrapidly loses her mind\u2014is Oldman\nsimply a figment of her warped\nimagination?\nCertainly something different\nfrom director Nicholas Roeg but a movie only to be seen if, for some\nreason, you want to spend an\nevening in a confused state of mind\nyourself.\nMichael Porter.\nVIDEO\nThe Yob\nThe Comic Strip\nWhat are these Comic Strip people\non?\nPatrick Church is a cocaine\nsniffing, pretentious jerk with an\nattach able girlfriend to match.\nSteven Kendall is a man with a walnut for a brain.\nThe two of them stumble into a time machine in the laboratory of a mad scientist in a Fly-type\nexperiment and the consequences of\nthis gradually transform the two\ninto absurd caricatures of each other\nto the amazement and distress of\nthe people around them.

    "content": "IN THE\nPIPELINE Science\nANDREW\nHALL\nEngineering: No Thanks\nIn the middle of September the\nDepartment of Education ordered\nan inquiry into why the numbers of\nuniversity and polytechnic students\npursuing degrees in engineering are\ninsufficient to meet the needs of\nindustry. The new investigation is\nto centre on two surveys to be\ncarried out over the next six months\ninto, firstly, why many sixth former s studying maths and physics 'A' levels do not pursue engineering\ndegrees and, secondly, why so\nmany engineering undergraduates\nabandon their courses, and what\ntheir future career choices are.\nAnother problem of equally serious\nmagnitude, but outside this inquiry,\nis the number of engineering\ngraduates who proceed to careers\nin, for example, banking and\naccountancy.\nFewer Students\nUniversities are beginning to feel the\neffects of a reducing university-age\npopulation in falling applications,\nbut the fall in engineering\napplications is far more rapid:\ngeneral engineering course\napplications fell by 28% compared\nwith 1987, civil and electronic\nengineering applications by 10%.\nThe problem causes considerable\nanxiety to Imperial College at a time\nwhen it is required by Government\nto increase student numbers.\nThe main deterrents to sixth-former s applying to engineering\ncourses are the questions of status\nand salary. Engineering has a very\nlow status in Britain compared to\nour major competitors such as West\nGermany, and this is not helped by\nevery other manual worker in the\ncountry calling themselves\n'engineer'. Mechanical engineers\nmend your car and drive trains,\nelectrical engineers mend your\nwashing machine, civil engineers\nbuilt the M25 and nobody knows\nwhat a chemical engineer does, or\nat best thinks he is a creator of\npollution; acid rain and nuclear\nwaste, because of course sulphur\ndioxide and iodine-131 are\nchemicals. Maybe it is time to bring\nin the marketing people to think of\na brand new image and name and\nforget about calling ourselves\n'engineers' at all.\nSalary may be an even bigger\ndifference. Propsective students will\nhave their eyes on the kind of salary\nthat they will be earning on\ngraduating. Careers such as\naccountancy or medicine offer far\nhigher salaries than engineering;\nsmall wonder that university\nmedical courses are so hard to get\non to.\nTo encourage more students into\nengineering courses, one way might\nbe to consider giving a financial\nincentive for students to study\nengineering. At present you receive\nthe same grant for an engineering\ncourse as for studying Mediaeval\ntwine spinning with Serbo-Croat or\nother such courses of dubious\nworth. There has existed for a number of years a National\nEngineering Scholarship scheme,\nwhich was intended to encourage\npeople of high calibre to pursue\nengineering careers, with a financial\ncarrot of a \u00a3500-a year bursar y. However, the scheme is\nadministered in such a way that you\nwould already have to have applied\nto an engineering course through\nUCCA before your application for a scholarship is processed; so even if\nyou are unsuccessful you are\ncommitted to pursuing an\nengineering course. The scheme\ntherefore will only appeal to people\nwho were going to study\nengineering anyway, and is a waste\nof both taxpayers' and the industrial\nsponsor's money. The rapid fall off\nin engineering applications appears\nto indicate that the scheme hasn't achieved its objectives; what is\nrequired is the certain knowledge on\napplying for university places that\nadequate financial support will be\nreceived by all engineering\nstudents.\nThe only other way to increase\nstudent numbers on engineering\n.courses is to lower the admission\nstandards which is like burning\ndown the house to cook the pig.\nThere was a lot of publicity earlier\nin the summer when ' A' level\nresults were published, aimed at\npeople whose results were worse\nthan required for their engineering\ncourses, encouraging them to\npursue their applications, as the\nuniversities were equally desperate\nto recruit students. It is not good for\nthe students; either the course will\nhave to be made easier to the\ndetriment of the better-ability\nstudents or the less able students\nwill struggle and the drop-out rate\nwill increase. Maybe this is the\nreason that the drop-out rate from\nsome engineering courses is as high\nas 20% (twice the average for all\nsubjects). For the universities it only\nsatisfies the short-term objective of\nfilling courses; in the longer term it\ncould be most damaging.\nUniversities should not be lowering\nstandards required for degrees,\nlower admission standards will\ninevitably produce worse degree\nresults. This, together with an\nincreasing drop-out rate will reflect\nvery badly on the universities.\nAdditionally, in expending extra\neffort on teaching less-able students,\nteaching staff will be diverted from\nmore useful occupation of their\ntime. Finally, it represents worse\nvalue-for-money for the taxpayer as\ndrop-outs from courses are an\nexpensive waste.\nGraduates\nThere is a growing tendency for\ngraduates of engineering (and\nscience) to pursue careers in\nfinancial service industries rather\nthan in 'engineering' as such. It is\nright that graduates should be\nentirely free to choose in what way\nto use their degrees and what career\npath to pursue; any attempt to\ncommit engineering graduates to a particular career would be th oro gh ly wrong, and completely against the\nGovernment's 'free market'\nphilosophy. To some extent the\nproblem lies with engineering\ndegree courses; a common concern\nin University departments is that\ntheir courses may be deterring\ngraduates from entering\nengineering as a career; however,\nthe problem is more that the degrees\nsuit their owners to such a wide\nvariety of careers. It is all the more\nsurprising that fewer people are\napplying to engineering courses in\nthe light of this. It does seem a bit\nof a waste, however, to teach people\nengineering skills that they will\nnever use in their careers.\nMore graduates may be\nencouraged to enter industry if\nsalaries were higher; however,\nwhatever industry can pay\ngraduates, accountancy firms and\nmerchant banks will always be able\nto pay more. Ultimately this is to the\nlong-term detriment of the nation\u2014\nwe will eventually be able to count\nour wealth, but not create it.\nIncreasing the number of students\nstudying engineering may not\nnecessarily help the problem,\nparticularly if an incentive such as\nincreasing grants for engineering\nstudents is used. The end result\nmay well be a vast increase in the\nexpense of engineering education\nwithout any appreciable increase in\nthe flow of graduates into industry.\nWithout the solution of this\nproblem, solving the problem of\nfilling university engineering\ncourses, the subject of the new\nDepartment of Education inquiry,\nwill not achieve anything useful. An\ninvestigation into why the needs of\nindustry are not being met by the\ngraduates who have already been\ntrained for this purpose at great\nexpense would be far more useful.\nAs this would require the\ncooperation of the Departments of\nEducation and of Trade and\nIndustry, such an investigation is\nunlikely.\nMENCAP\nTARTS & D/s COLLEC\nMeet CCu offices, warn, Saturday 15th October\nto be registered and given cans.\nFree disco in die J CR Saturday evening for ail\ncollectors, JJ%ftm to 11pm.

Much though it pains me to have to\nput pen to paper, or, to be more\naccurate, finger to keyboard, I feel\nI must, since an activity dear to my\nheart seems in great danger of being\nmutated beyond recognition. 1\nspeak of none other but the ancient\nart of relieving students and\nmembers of the public of their\nmoney to benefit those less well oft\nthan ourselves. In other words Rag.\nBefore I begin to talk about a subject\nabout which, for all you know, I may have no knowledge of'\nwhatsoever, I 'll provide a couple of,\ncredentials; I have been a member\nof Rag Committee (co-opted) for the\nlast three years, organised several\nRag events including the '88 Rag\nFete, and personally raised over\n\u00a3700 last year.\nThe problems Rag is currently\nfacing are exemplified by the saga!\nof IC Rag Mags, this year'sl\nincluded. Since I started at IC in the18384 session (i.e. six years ago) two\nRag Mags have been stillborn due\nto 'censorship' problems, we have\npublished one of the best the\ncountry has seen (the 83-84 edition),\nanother good one (85-86) made the\nnational press due to jokes about the\nBradford City fire, and we had a panic production last year of a substandard product because the\noriginal was both too small and\nlacked almost any quality\nwhatsoever. All of these Rag Mags\nwere sold in public on the streets at\nsome point, and one, the 85-86, was\nin fact banned by the Exec (after\nseveral thousand pounds had been\nspent on printing) only to be\nun banned at aUG M. And now this\nyear's edition, after much\nconfusion, seems to be teetering on\nthe brink between banning or\nrelease. At this stage I begin to\nwonder what a Rag Mag is for, and\nwhy we bother producing one.\nProduced by students\nit contains student\nhumour necessarily of\na specialised nature\nThe first thing a Rag Mag is for is\nto raise money for charity. It is\nproduced by students and contains\nstudent humour, necessarily of a specialised nature. If you go to the\nbar and hear some of the stories told\nthere they will be rude, offensive to\nsome, contain 'bad language' and\nbe sexually explicit. This is all part\nand parcel of student humour, and,\nas a collection of student humour,\na Rag Mag MUST contain these\nelements. You might otherwise just\nreprint an already existing public\njoke book! But it is these very same\nelements that members of the\ngeneral public will find offensive.\nI'm sure part of the reason why\nthese jokes are funny to the anarchic\nstudent populace is th t many would\nfind them offensive JJ he se elements\nare also those that censorship\ncommittees would remove the\nprincipal elements of student\nhumour.\nproduced, don't even try to publish\nat all. The existence of the\ncensorship committee really implies\nthat the people who elect the Rag\nMag Editor, namely all of you out\nthere, are income p tent and not to be\ntrusted with your choice. If that's the case then don't hide it behind\nthe pretence of a committee on\n'censorship'. Have a proper\neditorial board and get the Mag put\ntogether by the sabbaticals, Rag\nChairman and helpers. This is in fact\nmore or less what he ppen ed last\nyear, and the result, while still a Rag\nLet's look at the job of the Rag\nMag editors. They spend a summer,\nor in some cases much longer,\nmaking jokes up, compiling them\nfrom friends, extorting articles from\npeople. Producing this stuff is a long\nand thankless task, and typesetting\nand pasting-up are worse. But it's If you elect an Editor\nlet them edit\nnot really their product at all. The\nfinal say about what goes in is up\nto the censorship committee, in our\ncase the Rag Chairman, the Editor\nand the three Union Sabbaticals.\nThey have total say on what goes in\nor out. They are, in fact, really an\neditorial board, with the people who\ndo all the work more like sub-- editors, subject to the whim and\nfancy of the committee, who have\nno conception of the blood, sweat,\ntears and time that go into as large\na creative effort as a Rag Mag. If you\nelect an editor, let them edit; if you\ndon't trust them, don't elect them,\nand if you don't like what might be\nMag, was a much paler effort than\nIC has seen for many a year.\nA solution to most of these\nproblems is to make sure that\npeople who will appreciate the\ncontent are the ones who will get\nthe Rag Mag, and those who will be\noffended will not. In other words\nsell it to students, and not on the\nstreet. (Incidentally, the Rag Raids\nlast year which were intended to sell\nRag Mags to general punters on the\nstreets turned more into street\ncollections since there isn't much\nmarket for Rag Mags to the general\npublic anyway!). This proposal\nseems to have mutated somewhat\nWe are raising money\nfor these charities, not\nacting as subsidiaries\nfor them...\nsince it was made last year. The\nmost ridiculous thing I have heard\nso far this year is the new decision\nthat the Rag Mag should be sent to\nthe supported charities before\napproval. This presents several\nproblems. Firstly, the directors of\ncharities are usually the pillars of the\nestablishment which much of Rag\nMag humour seeks to undermine.\nOf course they won't like it.\nSecondly, is the issue of our\nindependence. We are raising\nmoney for these charities, not acting\nas subsidiaries of them under their\nfull control. If this principle is\nextended, we will be sending the\ncharities the whole of our Rag\nprogramme for approval, in the\npossible event that they find one or\ntwo little bits of it not to their taste.\nThis should of course include the\nscripts of Smoking Concert\nsketches, the strange costumes\nworn on collections, and just about\nWould charities\napprove of a nude fire\nengine ride?\neverything else. Would the\nChildren's Day charities really\napprove of someone collecting in\ntheir name by doing a strip tease in\nfront of Eros as Fiona Nicholas, this\nyear's Rag Chairman, did last year?\nOr a nude Fire Engine ride in South\nKensington to help Brain Injured\nchildren (Nigel Baker, last year's Rag Chairman, and this year's President took part in this)? And\nwhat about the other activities that\nhappen during Rag Events? Would\nGuide Dogs for the Blind really\nwant to take money from a group\nof students who rampage around\nthe country stealing traffic signs as\nwell as collecting? Nigel has\ncertainly been involved with, nay\nactively encouraged, such acts of\nvandalism.\nThese charities are, of course, only\ntoo grateful to accept the money we\ngive them, but if they start having\nto take responsibility for some of our\nactions by, for example okaying a publication, they are obviously\ngoing to be more reluctant about\nthings. If they don't know, they\ndon't care, but force them to take\nnote and they will cover their legal\nbacks as much as possible. Is this,\nperhaps, what this move is all\nabout? Nigel's address to the\nFreshers on the first day of term\nincluded a fine recommendation\nthat we should be realistic in our\noutlooks.

    "content": "Feature\nHow to survive IC\nDon Adlingtonjs the College's Student Counsellor\nGiven the entry qualifications of students coming to Imperial College,\nit is almost in conceive able that anyone would be admitted who was not\ncapable of working at degree level, and ultimately of attaining a degree.\nIn some respects under garu at es are already experts at study and at\nexamination preparation by the time they arrive here. Despite this it is\nnot at all uncommon for students to discover that their previous experience\nof systematic learning does not, apparently, guarantee a smooth transition\nto successful study at university. The study skills and learning hab'its\nwhich brought success at 'O' and 'A' levels may prove to be inadequate\nor invalid at university, and academic work, for the first time perhaps,\nbecomes a problem. Strikingly, this is at least as likely to happen to the\nperson with outstandingly good 'A' level grades as to anyone else, but\nit is always a thro roughly de moral ising experience and needs to be\nidentified and dealt with urgently. A few points that seem to me to be\nimportant.\nA. Usually when first-year\nundergraduates have academic\ndifficulties, it has more to do with\nthe sheer volume and unrelenting\nnature of the workload, rather than\nthe intellectual level of the work.\nThe student whose habit has been\nto work in short intensive bursts\nprior to examinations, and who has\nnot been used to sustained, week-in-week-'out effort, may well find\nhimself in difficulty quite quickly.\nB: Learning is an interactive\nprocess that demands time, energy\nand commitment. Effective learning\ncannot be done passively e.g. by\nhalf-hearted ly reading through\nlecture notes or handouts.\nResponding to problem sheets, or\ngroup interaction in class for\nexample, will be immeasurably\nmore fruitful.\nC. Thinking is intrinsically\ndifficult, and, for most of us, a vaguely unwelcome activity, at least\ninitially. Because it's difficult, we\nhave an in-built tendency to skirt,\nround it. For many people the\nproblem is breaking into it, for\nexample starting. We think of other\nimportant but less demanding\nthings to do instead, like writing\nletters, washing up, shopping, etc.\nD. University students sometimes\nrun into difficulties because for the\nfirst time the work they do (or don't do) is determined by minute to\nminute decisions as to how they use\ntheir time. The immediate moral\nconstraints of the expectations of\none's family, or of sixth form\nteachers are no longer there. There\nis an enhanced emphasis on\nself-motivation.\nE. It sometimes takes a little time\nto find a proper balance between the\ndemands of work and those of other\ncompeting interests, all of which\nmay well be the normal healthy\nexpression of a full student life. The\nmanagement of time, informed by\nrecognition that invidious choices\nhaving difficulty with work, he is\ndenied the vital reward of\nunderstanding, which may,\nremarkably quickly, depress his\nconfidence and overflow on to other\nparts of his study. It is this close\nidentification of the emotional state\nof confidence and buoyancy with\nsuccessful ongoing study, and the\nconverse identification of intellectual\ndefeat with depressive ness and\nsubsequent academic collapse,\nwhich lends such urgency to dealing\nwith the problem.\nsometimes have to be made, is a skill that must be acquired if it isn't there already. I am occassionally\nsurprised by a student having no\napparent conception of the scale of\nthe task he has taken on, regarding\nthe odd hour's work in the evening\nas a major concession. Studying for\na degree at university is a full time\njob, and is probably the hardest job\nthat most of us ever do. It inevitably\ninvolves trading in or postponing\nother desirable ends.\nF. All the psychological literature\non learning emphasises the\nimportance of reward, and the\nnotion that reward is central to\neffective learning holds good over\na very wide spectrum of activity\nrelated to successful study at\nuniversity. At the macro level\u2014the\nfundamental motives for going for\na degree at all\u2014it is crucial. The\nrewards of prestige, of economic\nsecurity, or the excitement of\nunderstanding one's subject at a deeper level, of fulfilling the\nexpectations of family and teachers,\nare obvious ones. If these things are\nnot valued sufficiently, the resilience\nand buoyancy which are necessary\nto overcome contingent difficulties\nwill be undermined, and the\nstudent will falter.\nThat learning must be rewarding\nis also true in the more detailed day-to-day sense. When a student is\nWhat do you do if you become\nworried about your work?\nA. Be pragmatic. If your work\nhabits seem not to be effective,\nchange them. For example, if you\nfind it difficult to work much in the\nevening, try getting up early and\ndoing a couple of hours before\ncoming into College. If you find it\nall too easy to be distracted working\nin your room, try working in the\nlibrary instead. Don't spend hour\nafter hour staring blankly at notes,\ntext books, problem sheets. Break\naway for a short time\u2014have a coffee, walk around for a bit, stand\non your head in the corner if it\nhelps\u2014then try again. Break down\nyour work into small tasks (which\nis really just another way of saying\ndevelop a system of study) and put\na limit on what you're going to do,\nand how long you're going to spend\non it. An ad hoc, disorganised\napproach to work may have suited\nyou before, but if the evidence is\nthat it is not adequate now then\nchange the way you do things, and\nfeel confident that you are capable\nof changing.\nB. Talk to your personal tutor. If\nfor any reason you prefer not to do\nthis, make an appointment to see\nyour senior tutor, whom you can\nsee independently and without any\ndisloyalty or discourtesy to your\npersonal tutor. If your work or\nattendance falls off badly, your\nsenior tutor may well send for you,\n;but on the whole academic staff are\ntolerant of a less than perfect\nperformance from students,\nrecognising that people have\ndifferent levels of competence and\ndifferent rates of applying\nthemselves to their degree course.\nIt is entirely possible for you to\nbecome seriously worried about\nyour work before it becomes\nobvious to anyone else, and the\nonus is on you to initiate discussion\nabout it with those best fitted to help\nyou.\nC. By all means have a look in\nlibraries and bookshops for books\non study skills and study\nproblems\u2014you may well find\nsomething helpful and certainly it\ncan't do any harm. There is also a very short booklet available in\nCollege called 'Study Success'. It\nwas written by two current\nmembers of academic staff (a physicist and an engineer) heavily\ninvolved in undergraduate teaching,\nand. seems to me both thoughtful\nand relevant. Ask your senior tutor\nor departmental officer for a copy,\nor ring me and I will send you one.\nD. Come to see me. I am easily\navailable, and my work is entirely\nconfidential, eg I won't talk to your\ndepartment behind your back. Your\ntime at university is precious\u2014it is\nalso finite\u2014and there may be\nimportant practical reasons for\ntalking around anxieties about work\nsooner rather than later. For one\nthing the flood of new material\nbeing thrown at you is likely to be\nrelentless, and this can induce a very nasty feeling of panic if for\nsome reason you are struggling to\nkeep going. For another thing,\ntiming may be critically important\nshould there be some question of\ntransferring to another course,\ndepartment or university.\nA final word. No one on the\nCollege staff derives satisfaction\nfrom students' academic distress.\nDepartments are adequately\nresourced to contain the full\ncomplement of their first-year intake\nright the way through to final\ngraduation. There is no requirement\nfor a standard 'failure rate'. On the\ncontrary there is a great concern that\nstudents who are not working well\nshould be identified early enough\nfor real help to be given, and the key\nto that, quite often, is the student's willingness to acknowledge the\nproblem.\nThink about it.\nOctober 14 1988 FELIX Page 5\n\n"

The pub has\nnow become 'The Flamingo\nBrewery Company' managed by\nClifton Inns, a Grand Met\nsubsidiary. There is rumour that\nMidsummer intend to open a new\nFlamingo and Firkin in Derby later\nthis year.\nWhilst David and Louise Bruce\nhave disappeared off into the Med\nfor a cruise and a well earned rest,\nthe other two ex-directors of the\nFirkin chain have gone straight back\ninto the business.

    "content": "THE cR OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nStudents Hold Out\non Hall Fees\nStudents in Fisher Hall have decided to hold a rent protest after claims\nof 'a deliberate attempt to mislead' them over their rents by the Student\nAccommodation Office. A meeting of 90 or so students in the Fisher Hall\nCommon room decided to pay rent for eleven weeks only at last year's rates. Rents in Fisher Hall have increased drastically since last year after\nthe rooms were reappraised for rent purposes. Students are also expected\nto pay rent for an extra week in the Christmas holiday.\nFisher Hall residents have the letters sent out to Freshers\ndistributed a sheet outlining their\ndismay at the rent increases, which\nthey claim they were unaware of\nbefore moving in. The sheet outlines\nhow much students should pay if\nthey disagree with paying higher\nrents this year. They have also\ndrawn up a standard letter to\nenclose with a reduced payment.\nSenior Assistant Finance Officer,\nMr Malcolm Aldridge told FELIX he\nwas 'glad that they are paying what\nthey think to be the reasonable\namount' rather than paying\nnothing.\nasked, she claimed. Mrs\nO 'Callaghan admitted, however,\nthat the failure to indicate a rent on\nbefore they arrived did leave her at\nfault. She defended the \u00a340 single\nroom rent in Fisher Hall, saying\nAccommodation Officer Loretto\nO 'Callaghan said she did not intend\nto mislead students. She added that\nthe postal strike had forced her staff\nto telephone students in Britain,\ninforming them that they had a room. To save time and money,\nstudents were not told their rent\nover the telephone unless they\n'Does anybody think \u00a340 is a lot to\nspend on a room in Central\nLondon?...! don't' ICU President Nigel Baker, part of\nwhose res pons bil i ties lie with\nLoretto O 'Callaghan Accommodation Officer\naccommodation, said of the protest\nT think it has been done in a very\nresponsible way'. He added that he\ndid not support the protest and\npointed out that if the Fisher Hall\nresidents do not pay the increased\nrents, rent increases will be greater\nstill across the board next year.\nMr Baker hopes to be able to\ncompensate for the extra week's rent in the next academic year. He\nhas suggested a change in term\ndates to give students at IC a31 week academic year. At present,\nstudents working over 30 weeks can\nclaim for an extra week's grant. The\nproposal, which Mr Baker hopes to\ntake to the College's Governing\nBody, will set term dates to start\nmid-week. Mr Baker explained that\nstudents already work a31 week\nyear. The new plans should not\nincrease the length of the year, he\nclaimed.\nStudents in College\naccommodation are now expected to\npay twelve weeks' rent this term in\nspite of the term lasting eleven\nweeks. This change was decided by\nthe Student Residence Committee\n(SRC) in June and was taken into\naccount in the rent increases,\naccording to Senior Assistant\nFinance Officer, Mr Aldridge.\nMr Aldridge went on to explain\nthat the rents and the twelve week\nrent for this term were authorised\nby the rector in July. The extra\nweek's rent means that students will\nbe able to use their rooms as\nstorerooms or accommodation foi>\nthe three weeks over the Christmas.\nIn previous years, residents have\nbeen required to place their\nbelongings in store rooms or take\nthem home over the Christmas\nvacation.\nRag Mag\nWithdrawn\nIC Rag Mag Editor, Dave Williams\nhas withdrawn this year's Rag Mag\nafter storming out of a heated\ndiscussion on its sale and censorship\nat the Rag meeting last Friday. Mr\nWilliams is concerned by the Rag\nCommittee's proposal to ask\nUniversities for permission before\nselling the Rag Mag on their\ncampuses. The move comes amidst\ncomplaints from several Rag\nCommittee members that the\ncommittee has become isolated by\n'rag-hack dom'. Mr Williams told FELIX that the\nRag Committee plan to send copies\nof the Rag Mag to the Charities they\ncollect for. 'It's quite possibly the\nmost ridiculous idea I 've ever\nheard,' he said. He claims that the\nCharities would be shocked by the\ncontent of the Rag Mag, even if it\nwere heavily censored. He added\nthat he has said all along he is\n'prepared to take some cuts.'\nMr Williams went on to say that\nalthough he was prepared to accept\nsome censorship of the Rag Mag, he\nwas not prepared to contact\nUniversities in advance of its sale.\nHe claims other Universities will not\nbother to look at the Rag Mag.\nInstead, he says, they will refuse\npermission for the sale of Rag Mags\non their campuses, on the basis of\n'Imperial bashing'.\nRag Committee Chairman, Fiona\nNicholas, told FELIX that she saw\nno problem in persuading other\nUniversities to take the Rag Mag.\n'When I went to the Rag Conference\nlast January, they all wanted to buy\nour Rag Mags,' she said. Miss\nNicholas now wants Mr Williams to\ntake the new Rag Mag to this year's. continued on back page\nISSUE 813 14 OCT 1988\n\n"

When\nexplaining why she wanted to\ncontact Universities in advance she\nsaid she did not want their sale to\nclash with other colleges' Rag\nefforts.

Both Mr\nBradshaw and Mr Williams are\nupset by the attitudes of the Rag\nCommittee. 'Any Freshers who had\ncome to it would never come to a Rag meeting again/ said Mr\nBradshaw. 'We seem to have lost\nsight of the main aim of Rag which\nis to collect money for charity,' he\nadded.\nFollowing a letter from ICU\nPresident, Nigel Baker, Mr Williams\nhas dispelled rumours i hat the\nRoyal College of Science Union\n(RCSU) planned to fund the Rag\nMag. The letter from Mr Baker\nexplained that if such a funding\nwere to go ahead he would insist\nupon the removal of all references\nto Imperial College Union and ICU\nRag. In the letter, Mr Baker also\nexpressed concern over the effects\nof the funding upon the RCSU\nclubs' finances. Mr Williams pointed\nout that such a funding would be a loan from the RCSU finances, and\nwould not affect the clubs. He\ndenied any moves to fund the\npublication by RCSU.\nMr Williams still hopes to be able\nto produce a Rag Mag in time for\nRag Week in four weeks. Most of\nthe sales of the mag come from Rag\nWeek. He concluded however that\nthe Rag Committee 'are really Wiling\nthe spirit of Rag ', and added that\n'Rag's about getting everybody out\non the street and having a good\ntime.'\nMSF Strike\nVote\nThe Manufacturing, Science and\nFinance Trade Union (MSF) voted\nlast week to take industrial action on\nthe 18th of October, to implement\nother industrial action other than\nstoppages and to^take further\nindustrial action'in the future,\nfollowing a national ballot.

Mr. John\nFecamp of IC MSF said \"The idea\nis to use the day as a massive\ndisplay of protest.\"\nThe move follows an independent\nreport made jointly by MSF and the\nuniversities. The report was\nassessed by Sir Peter Matthews\n(chairman of the Armed Forces and\nNurses Pay Review bodies) which\nconcluded that university pay was\n18% below the equivalent in\nindustry. The trade unions are\nunhappy that the Government and\nuniversities have decided not to act\non the report.\nWelfare\nOfficer\nThe University of London Union\nhas rejected plans to employ a joint\nIC Union/ULU Welfare Adviser.\nThe scheme was described as\n'un fe as able', and the two unions are\nplanning to appoint their own\nseparate welfare advisers\nICU President Nigel Baker told\nFELIX that he hopes to appoint an\nadviser within a fortnight, to start\nwork towards the end of the term.\nULU are now initiating their own\nwelfare service.\nMr Baker was initially told that the\nCollege would replace the part-time\nWelfare Adviser Linda Simmons\nwhen she left in March this year.\nSince the post covers problems\nconcerning Social Security Benefits,\nGrants and many other areas, it was\nfelt that a full-time adviser was the\nbest solution. College Secretary,\nJohn Smith agreed to a reappointment on a part-time basis\nafter a letter from Mr Baker in June.\nMr Baker used the appointment of\nan assistant/secretary to Mrs Clare\nAsh, the Rector's wife, in the HUB\noffice as a bargaining point in the\nletter. At the time of Linda\nSimmons' departure from the post\nof Welfare Adviser, College Policy\nwas not to replace staff. The\nAssistant/ Secretary was employed\nin direct contravention of this policy.\nThe HUB Office has had an increase\nof \u00a310,000 for its annual finances.\nA letter from Irene AddisonChild, UL U Research and Training\nOfficer, was sent to Mr Baker in\nJune, asking for advice and\ninformation about welfare services\nat IC. Mr Baker wrote to Mr Jackson,\nproposing the idea of a joint-adviser\non August 25. He stressed the\nurgency of the situation since ICU\nwas planning to in state the adviser\nby the beginning of this term.\nNothing was done until Mr Baker\nrang Mr Jackson, calling for a meeting to discuss the matter.\nWhen questioned about the delay\nand lack of response, Mr Jackson\nblamed the postal strike.\nA meeting was held on September\n15 at which Mr Jackson and Mr\nBaker were present along with other\nULU sabbaticals and ULU Senior\nAdministrator, Peter Anwyl. During\na discussion after the meeting, at\nwhich Mr Baker was not present,\nthe proposal for a joint-adviser was\nrejected by ULU due to 'the simply\nunfeasible and unrealistic' time\nscale.\nULU also cited the possibility of\nthe scheme conflicting with their\n'developing welfare strategy.'This\nstrategy includes a 'network of\nstudent welfare volunteers, at least\nin the immediate future.' When\nasked about present volunteer\nnumbers Mr Jackson was not able to\nconfirm any and apologised for the\nfailure of the Union to send a briefing document on their welfare\npolicy. Mr Jackson is in charge of\nwelfare at ULU.

The portions are\ntoo small to be filling and they are\nmore expensive than the other\nCollege outlets. If anything the\nUnion Snack bar ought to be\ncheaper than the College outlets. It\nshould be a service; unlike QT it\ndoes not have to rip-off students to\nsub sid is e an unprofitable refectory\nservice.\nNevertheless, the quality of the\nfood in the Snackbar is excellent. If\nthe problems with portion size and\nprice can be overcome there is no\nreason why the snack bar should\nnot become the best food outlet in\nthe College.\nThe Main Dining Hall. When\nFELIX ran a story over the Summer\nabout the refurbishment of the\ndining hall it caused a great deal of\nconsternation within the Sherfield\ncorridors of power.\nThe story explained how the\nRector's wife, Clare Ash, engaged\na consultancy firm to redesign the\nlighting system in the refectory. The\nplanned economy strip lighting,\nwhich was already being installed,\nwas ousted in favour of lamps\nwhich pointed at the ceiling and a dimmer system. The changes put an\nextra two weeks on the work and\ncost an alleged extra \u00a3 3 0 , 0 0 0\naccording to sources within\nSherfield.\nFELIX was contacted by Mrs Ash\nsoon after the story had been\npublished. She wanted to know\nwho had leaked the figure to FELIX,\nclaiming that it was incorrect. Later,\nthe Rector took me aside and asked\nthe same question. When I refused\nto answer he mentioned the name\nof a Sherfield official and asked me\nto nod if I had been given the\ninformation by that official.\nLet me point out here and now\nthat FELIX will never, under any\ncircumstances reveal any of its\nsources.

The BRSCC took an early four\npoint lead but this was pulled back\nand the teams raced neck and neck\nuntil the score was 9-9 with only one\nquestion remaining.

    "content": "Feature\nTHE FEATURE THE UNION TRIED TO BAN\nThe Union Snack Bar\nTwo of the food outlets around College have recently been refurbished.\nThe Union Snack Bar, situated in the Union Building, Beit Quad, serves\ntwo hot dishes a day, salads and a variety of vegetarian foods all freshly\nprepared. While the Main Dining Hall in the Sherfield building has added\na new pasta bar to its established traditional dishes.\nAre the discerning tastes of IC's students satisfied ? Felixihvestigates\nAfter last year's problems the\nUnion Snack Bar is trading once\nagain. The debts from last year have\nbeen written off and a further\n\u00a3 4 0 , 0 0 0 has been spent on\nimprovements in what Union\nDeputy President Chas Brereton\ndescribes as the 'most major\nrefurbishment of facilities in recent\ntimes.'\nThe bar has been redecorated; the\nlounge seats replaced with modern\nchairs and matching circular tables.\nAlso new are two vending machines\nand a pool table. There are new staff\nand a new Snack Bar Manager, Mr\nIan Richards. A catering consultant\nwas responsible for the whole\nspectrum of the operation from the\nimage, to recruiting staff,\nstructuring and pricing of the menu,\nright down to recommending the\nsize of portions.\nThe Union refurbishment cost\n\u00a340,000\nThe accounting books give an\nunequivocal affirmative; the first\nweek's takings were up 22% on a similar period last year. But\nnumbers are, at best, only half the\nstory. What does that expert of\nculinary criticism, Mr Joe Student\nthink ?\nLayout\nDave Peacock, who as Union\nManager has overseen the work on\nthe snack bar talks of the 'total meal\nexperience' and of meals that go\nbeyond the 'diameter of the plate.'\nTo this end the whole refurbishment\nwas aimed to promote the Snack Bar\nas a social area as well as a place to\neat.\nTalking to the customers on\nTuesday the layout and the\natmosphere were generally\nappreciated. There were a few\nm aver ici cs.i via nu y,arn y sics student felt it was 'too clean and\ncan teeny' whilst her friend\nFarznana thought it to be 'improved\nbut not as cosy.' Tony, a Physics\nPostgraduate commented 'the pool\ntable's a bit daft\u2014they could have\nhad more tables.'\nFood\nA new step this year has been the\nintroduction of slightly\nunconventional vegetarian dishes.\nIan Richards, the Snack Bar\nManager concedes that quite a lot of\nthe dishes are 'heavily Vegan' and\nthat there had been complaints\nabout the sweet and sour lentils and\npasta with peanut butter sauce\nbecause 'people are not used to it.'\nChen a Biochemistry student was\nimpressed.'Very good food, I like\nthe idea of the vegetarian stuff-very healthy'\nOren from the Royal College of\nMusic commented 'some of it's quite good, some not very\nimaginative, some a bit like school\ndinners.'\nIt was generally felt that the\nvariety and balance of the menu was\ngood, except perhaps on the salads,\nwhilst some still felt there was a need for ve ge burgers. Rupert from Chemical\nEngineering was not so happy;\nwhilst he appreciated the money\nspent on the refurbishment he was\nnot at all impressed with his\nvegetable moussa ka which he\ndescribed as 'thinly sliced,\nunpeeled, virtually uncooked\npotato, aubergine, beautifully\ncovered with this film of curdled\nmilk.'\nAnother satisfied customer?\nValue for\nmoney Overall\nBut Lewis (Aero) was un appeased( what?): 'Overpriced, sh*t food\u2014a nightmare to find a seat!'\nBoth the size and cost of portions\nwere recommended by the catering\nconsultant who ran the London\nSchool of Economics Union cafe.\nChas and Dave put this down to a 'fine-tuning process' and some\nprices were changed on Tuesday,\nthough some were still 'a little\nanomalous'. Among these\nanomalies were the baked potatoes\nwith cheese which were initially\npriced at \u00a31.00 only to be reduced\nlater to the Southside price of 70p. Indeed, on Tuesday the students'\nlot was a happier one.\nIvan (Life Sci) felt that the prices\nwere 'fairly reasonable and,\ncompared with the JCR, quite\ngood'.\nSo when everything's said and\ndone, will people continue to eat in\nthe Snack Bar, or will they take their\ncustom elsewhere?\nChen (Chem/Biochem): 'I like the\nfood here better than the other\noutlets'\nDave and Tony (Physics PGs):\n'Better than anything else'\n'prefer the food in here\u2014more\nvariation and better value than QT'\nOthers use the Snack Bar because\nit's close to their department, and\nanother gave the hereto\nunconsidered, though slightly\npolitical view, that the Snack Bar\nwas 'miles from Mech Eng, so you\ndon't get any fascists in'.\nIan\nRichards\nIan has had ten years' experience\nin catering: working for large\ncompanies, such as Nissan, and also\nfor contract companies.\nAlthough he has inherited the\nmenu and costing, he hopes to\nchange things to win back the\ncustom lost due to the pricing. To\nthis end he is keen to have feedback\nand any comments\u2014'We're man\nenough to take it'\nPage 8 FELIX October 14 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion\napproval is a very big NO. Is it\npossible that this is what they expect\nand so this move is a backdoor to\nthe end of the IC Rag Mag? Why not\njust come out and say that its useful\nlife is over, and that we dare not\npublish another because it may\ncause Rag, the Union and the\nCollege a whole host of problems?\nBe honest with us above all else!\nI have now drifted away from the\nRag Mag question and am really\naddressing the whole area of the\nrunning of Rag in general. Over the\nlast year, and it certainly seems to\nbe continuing, Rag has been run by\nand, to an extent for, a very small\nand select group of people. The\nterm 'Raggie' has even been used to\ndescribe these Rag Hacks, and yes,\nlast year I certainly was one. This\nreally limits the involvement of\npeople in IC Rag, and is typified by\nthe vast totals some of us raised last\nyear, and by the faces which became\nall too familiar at the many Rag\nBureaucracy and\ncentralisation is killing\nIC Rag\nevents. The Rag Raids last year were\nnot even advertised to encourage\nnew people to turn up. This is all\npart of the bureaucracy and\ncentralisation that is gradually\nkilling IC Rag. Rag events now have\nto be cleared by one of four people\n(but for a last minute decision this\nwould have been only one person!).\nHow easily is a stranger to ICRAG\ngoing to get such clearance?\nImagination is being stifled, since a small group can come up with only\na limited number of ideas, and\nThis year's Rag Mag\u2014a close shave\nenthusiasm will decline as people\nget bored or frustrated. This is being\ndone in the best of intentions of\ncourse, trying to preserve our now\nregained street licence, but there is\na difference between being\nreasonably cautious, and being\ntotally neurotic. This line was\ncrossed about six months ago.\nAll I have done so far, you may\nsay, is sling rocks, and not suggest\nsolutions. Clearly we must address\nthe question of the Rag Mag's future, since at the moment we are\nmerely wasting the editor's time and\neffort with the continual uncertainty\nof the censorship position. Limiting\nsale to students and the removal of\ncensorship is my favoured solution,\nbut the end of the Rag Mag is\nanother possibility. The problem of\nthe attitude taken by this year's Rag\nNigel Baker tid d les whilst Rag burns\nChairman, and some of the\ncommittee, about Rag in general is\nmore difficult. An injection of\ncalcium to the spine might be an\nidea, but it does not address the\ncentral problem of the lack of\nrealism that predominates. I can\nonly hope that there is a reappraisal\nof some of the more ludicrous\nsuggestions about controlling the\nmaniac students hell-bent on losing\nus our license and privileges, and\nthat the spontaneity and fun that\nhas typified ICRAG in the past\nreturns. It's time to be realistic about\nhow Rag works, and how charities\nview us, and not to think that\neveryone is begging to have us help\nthem raise money.\nRecently I threatened to resign\nfrom the Rag committee as a protest\nabout the current state of affairs. I now believe such an action is not in\nthe best interests of Rag, but will\ninstead stay on the committee and\nfight for what Rag is really all about.\nI hope I can count on the support\nof many IC students in this, and\nwould suggest that you make your\nviews felt by turning up to the next\nRag meeting, which I believe is\ntoday, Friday October 14, in the\nLounge at 12.30pm. Rag is fun, go out\nand enjoy yourself\nand help others at the\nsame time\nOne last thing I should say, lest\nthe above should put people off\ngetting involved with Rag. Much of\nRag is fun, and will continue to be\nso, so go out and enjoy yourself on\na Rag event and help other people\nat the same time. That is really what\nRag is about.\n1\nDave Clements, PGAO etc.\nIf you have ideas and\nsuggestions for FELIX\ncontact the Concept Manager\nvia FELIX pigeonholes.\nSecondly, if you have any\nfew word quotes or thoughts\nwhich are serious or\nludicrous for a column\nstarting next week hand\nthem into FELIX c/o Concepts Manager.\nCity & Guilds\nBOAT PARTY & DISCO\n7pm till 11pm Tuesday 18th October\nONLY \u00a34\nTickets-any lunchtime from\nGuilds Office.
