Winter Field Events and Relays\ncompetition at Motspur Park. In\nthe two sprint relays I.C. failed to\nqualify for the finals, showing\nonly too clearly the lack of sprinting ability in the club this year.\nThe field events team, however,\ndid well to finish high in the final\nteam positions. The two individual results in each event were\naggregated and I.C. finished 1st in the High Jump, 2nd in the\nWeight and 4th in the Long Jump\nwith a total of 18 points; placing\nI.C.3 rd in the Tjalve Trophy behind U.C.(18^ pts.) and Guys\n(24 pts.).\nThe two mile Medley Relay\nprovided the climax of a rather\ndepressing afternoon for the College. W Shepherd and M. Dickson ran strong 880 yd. legs to put\nA. Bishop in 3rd place on the\nfinal stage. With a magnificent\n4min.32 sees, mile, Bishop came\nin to win on the final lap.

Tung, from the School of Oriental and African Studies, gave an\ninteresting talk on the Chinese\nlangage.\nChinese was first written down\nin 1700 BC. with a few of the\ncharacters originating from pic-ture s. There are about 40,000\ncharacters in all but fortunately,\nfor would-be aspirants only 6,000\nare in common use and, we were\ntold, it is possible to get by on\n2,000.\nChinese is a monosyllabic\nlanguage which uses four in flex ions in forming words. A mistake\nin pronunciation can mean the\ndifference between reading a book\nor cutting down a tree. The word\n\" ma \" can mean mother, what,\nhorse or scold, so be warned\u2014\nyou might get a horse-riding\nmother.\nThere are approximately sixteen dialects with Mandarin understood by two-thirds of the\npopulation. In southern China it\nis possible to be in sight of your\nneighbour on the next hilltop and\nnot be able to pass the time of\nday with him, however you can\nwrite your greetings on a note as\nthere is only one written language.\nThe evening ended with a welcome cup of Chinese tea and\nChinese chess for those in the\nknow.\nJ.

Also the furniture and props\nneed enough research to keep\neveryone happy.\nCostumes, in this historical allegory as Bolt's play is, needed\ncareful thought and we have experimented with painting and\ntexturing materials.\nAs for directing; well, there\nwas and is so much in the play as\nit stands that the problem was to\nselect and concentrate on one\naspect, the humanity and immediate appeal.

Determined to\nRegain Supremacy\nFELIX\nSUPPORT NEEDED\nFree coaches leave Union 12.45\n11\nOn Saturday, I.C, will meet\nWoolwich Polytechnic at Harlington in the first round of the\nU.L. Cup. Last year I.C. lost the\nCup Final for the first time in six\nyears and captain M. Eastell is\ndetermined to restore the Soccer\nClub of the College to it, usual\ndominating position.\nSeven members of I.C.A. FC.\nwho normally play for the London University XI will be available for this game, which is not\nto be looked upon with over-confidence. In the past, the inclusion of University players has\ntended to unsettle the I.C. team\nand at first sight the situation is\nworsened this year by the fact\nthat U.L. have not been having\na great deal of success. However, D. Vaughan, B. Griffiths\nand K. Stoddart have had a reasonable amount of experience\nwith I.C. sides and should fit into\nthe team quite well\nIngram is a safe and experienced goalkeeper and further experience will be added to the side\nby the inclusion of A. Crawford,\nD. Hunt, and T. Huxtable\u2014all\nlong standing players. R.J. Fairholme has been playing exceptionally well recently and Batcup is much improved following\nHockey\nK. Radford halts aN.

Bentham, are both very reliable and should prove to be outstanding members of the Soccer\nClub in the future.\nThe team will be selected from:\nIngram, Fairholme, Crawford, Hunt,\nGriffiths, Johnson, Stoddart, Vaughan,\nHuxtable, Eastell, Batcup, Bentham.\nTHE REST\nSailing\nThe Sarins Club has found its\nlong lost Firefly Dingy. The boat,\nironically named \"Fiasco\" disappeared from its berth on the\nWelsh Harp two years ago. Enquiries were made when \" Fiasco \" was advertised for sale in a well-known sailing magazine.\nBasketball\nThe first team, playing in the\nLondon League and U.L. U. League has produced the following results:\nI.C. first\u2014\n60\u2014 32 Goldsmiths65\u201430 Kingston Tech.\n3 3 _ 4 1 Woolwich.\n61\u2014 58 Chelsea.\nTable Tennis\nThe very encouraging response\nto the Table Tennis Club on\nFresher's Day and at the trials\nhas not been reflected in the\nwillingness of many team players\nto play re gura rly for the College.\nThis has been particularly true\nof the lower teams and the unprecedented step of withdrawing\nthe 6th team from the League has\nbeen necessary.\nThe 1st and 2nd teams both\nare, as yet, undefeated in Division\n1 on the U.L. League, and both\nare through the first two rounds\nof the Caribbean CUD.\nRugby\nI.C convincingly won their first\nround U.L. Cup match at Harlington on Nov. 18th. After ten\nminutes, when I.C. had settled\ndown, Weisner opened the scoring with a try from a loose ball.\nApart from their three-quarter\nline Northern Poly, offered little\nresistance to the exceptionally\nfluid I.C. team. Most of the I.C. team added to the score and\nTurner kicked 10 conversions.\nResult I.C.62 \u20140 Northern Poly.\nBadminton\nThe Imperial College Mixed\nBadminton team is this year\nmeeting with more success than it\nhas done in the past. Northern\nPolytechnic were recently\nsquashed 8-1 and a previously\nunbeaten Goldsmiths team have\nbeen beaten 5-4.\nA weakened men's first team\ndefeated Oxford University\nWoodpeckers 5\u20144. Fisher and\nD. Brittain both won their three\ngames with two wins each by R. Milward and S. Gadre.\nCross Country\nA steadily improving team has\nrecently beaten L.S.E. in a league\nmatch (for the first time in two\nyears). Also, in the last fortnight\nI.C. have beaten six teams and\nlost to only two, Met. Police and\nU.C. Soccer\nPOTENTIAL\nMATERIALISES\nI. C.4v. Goldsmiths 1\nBy M. Eastell\nAfter an uncertain start I.C. settled down well against an average Goldsmiths' side and came\nclose to scoring on a number of\noccasions. Right-winger Batcup\nwas especially unlucky when he\nhit an upright, and had two shots\nblocked on the line. The first\ngoal for I.C. came after about\nthirty minutes, when Bentham\nbeat two men, and slipped the\nball to Luxton, who side stepped\nhis full-back and shot into the\nnet from a narrow angle. However in the latter part of the first\nhalf Goldsmiths had more of the\nplay, but I.C. were able to hold\nout by good defensive work with\nJohnson playing well-Goldsmiths\nEqualise\nI.C. went straight into the\nattack after the interval, but were\nunable to add to their score before Goldsmiths broke away and\nscored, when a right wing centre\nwas headed home. However, I.C. fought back, and soon went ahead\nwhen Smart headed in a centre\nfrom Eastell. After this there\nwas a period of scrappy play in\nwhich Goldsmiths came back into\nthe game, but the I.C. forwards\nwere still combining very well\nand it came as no surprise when\nfirst Eastell and then Batcup\nscored.\nThis was a much improved display by I.C. who have been\nthreatening to play well for most\nof the season.\nLessons to be\nlearned\nBy Edward Needham\nThe matches on Wednesday\nNov- 25th, and the previous\nSaturday provided interesting\ncontrasts: on the Saturday I.C. played an average club side, Ashford, and beat them four goals to\nnil; on Wednesday I.C. lost by\none goal to nil against a poor St.\nBarts' Hospital side. It is interesting that when I.C. lost they\nhad their full team; yet a far\nbetter side were beaten on the\nSaturday with three reserves in\nthe I.C. team.\nThe lessons probably are these,\nand they apply equally to most\nother sports played in the College : most college or hospital\nsides tend to play a hard, rugged\ngame and tempers easily become\nfrayed; a club side relies, as I.C. probably do, on a little more\nsophistication. Thus I.C score\nwell against club sides, but score\nbadly against an inferior college\nside: this is because tempers are\nno substitute for good hockey.\nThe team had the same umpire\non both days, yet significantly he\nwas judged to have performed\nabysmally on the day I.C. lost:\nless theatrical s would have won\nthe game for I.C. However, in spite of these lapses,\nthe Hockey Club have had\na good season up to date, having\nwon 7 out of 12 matches by clear\nmargins, conceding 19 goals to\n34 scored. The defence, with the\nstrength of Castell, Phillips,\nPeters and Needham, is now\nbeing supported by a more settled\nand permanent forward line:\nHough is returning to his familiar\nscoring form, and the prospects\nfor the rest of the year remain\nbright.\nOTHER RESULTS\nSoccer:\n1st.2 \u20142, C.E.M.1 st.1 \u2014\n1 Christs Cambridge\n2nd.3 \u20143 Q.M.

The\npurpose is firstly, to suggest that their personal beliefs made their\nsupport of the amendment con-Sir,\nI feel it is my duty to register a complaint about a comment made\nin the last edition of FELIX. In\nyour report on the I.C. Union\ngeneral meeting, your reporter\nused the p liras e \"seconded by Mr.\nJ. Tutleman, well known Jew.\"\nI have noticed for some time that\nMr. J. Tutleman has become the\nobject of considerable merriment\namongst some circles within the\nUnion and I would like to say, on\nbehalf of the Jewish Society, that\nwe all have a great respect for\nMr. Tutleman, indeed we regard\nhim as our most DISTINGUISHABLE member.\nLast year Mr. Tutleman was\nchairman of the Jewish Society,\nand, at the last annual general\nmeeting, by a large vote, he was\npromoted to the position of EXChairman, which he now holds.\nBy the efficiency with which he\ncarries out his duties as EXchairman the average attendance\nhas doubled and continues to rise.\nThis is no mean achievement and\nhe has earned congratulations on\nall sides.\nSo, FELIX reporters, let us\nhave some respect for Mr. Tutleman, for indeed Mr- Frank Fuchs\nwould have looked pretty stupid\nwithout him\u2014or did he look\nmore stupid with him?\nNORMAN STRE AT\nZionist Officer l,C. Jewish Soc.\ncern ed calculated and dishonest,\nand secondly, to discredit their\nviews on any future matter of\nCollege affairs by encouraging\nyour readers to remember your\npersonal smears first and consider\nthe real issues afterwards.\nI demand from D. l.W. your\nassistant editor who wrote the\nreport: \u2014either have the courage\nplied by innuendo, and justify it,\nto print straight out what you im-or apologise to the people con-cern ed. Above all, don't do it again.\nIt is a serious thing to find such\nsmear tactics in any newspaper\nstudent or otherwise.\nYours sincerely,\nDAVID PEARCE\n(Physics)\nAdvertising\nMooney's Prices\nDear Sir,\nWhy is it that we have to pay &/\u2022 for a small\nhelping of chips in the top refectory in the Union,\nwt ii en for 6d. we could get more chips in a fish\nand chip shop? They don't provide nearly as\nmany chips per day as the refectory does, and yet\nthey still make a profit. Think what profit the\nUnion is making.\nYours faithfully,\nN.R. BAILHACHE E.E.2. Dear Sir,\n1 was interested to read th z letter by C.C. Wright and Brian\nBull in the last issue of FELIX. Whilst agreeing with them generally\nabout Club advertising, I think 15\" x12\" for posters is rather more\nthan adequate\u2014although the suggested 10\" x8\" is a bit small. I would suggest 13\" x8\" as a suitable size\u2014allowing sufficient space\nto advertise the CLUB and the EVENT, but not occupying too much\nof the Notice Board.\nThis introduces my main objection to the proposed New System\n(if I understood the FELIX report correctly\\)\u2014namely, that of\nadvertising of the CLUB is to be separated from advertising of the\nEVENT only the latter being allowed on the quarto sheet. This, I feel, will only result in less effective publicity\u2014whilst most people\nwould be attracted by the Event, some are undoubtedly attracted by\nthe Club, and it is these people who are in danger of being lost.\nThe solution is to simply divide the Notice Board into a number\nof rectangles, say 14\" x9\", and stipulate that no advert may exceed\nthe b&und aries of one rectangle- This would allow more efficient\nuse of the Board, eliminate unfair mono poli sing of space, and still encourage good advertising.\nFinally, I would like to remind other Clubs\u2014and the Unions] \u2014\nof two simple points that they habitually forget: \u2014\nFirstly, NO Advert, is effective after The Event has taken place\u2014\nso why not remove it promptly and leave the space for others?\nSecondly, as D. Jones has already pointed out (FELIX Oct. 21)\n\" Size is not the ultimate aim of an advertiser, it is to produce an eye\ncatching poster.\"\nPerhaps it would be worthwhile to start an informal competition\nbetween clubs\u2014prizes for the best adverts, not the largest or most\nelaborate]\nYours faithfully,\n(Publicity Officer, RICHARD MARSHALL\nTape & Hi-Fi Club) (Elec.

Throughout this term,\nSennet has managed to convince students at I.C. that it is impossible\nto send any news to you, for fear of your altering the facts to suit\nyour \" Sex and Depravity \" theme.\nYet you seem so keen to get news about I.C. that your staff\nring up our Union on the off chance that someone may be able to\ngive you a\" scoop.\" What has happened to your six I.C. reporters,\nthe I.C. ULJJ agent and the three constituent College Sennet~reps.?\nI don't suppose you ever see them. No wonder the UL U Presidents\nCouncil was dissatisfied with Sennet if your contacts are half as bad\nin the other colleges.\n.As I mentioned to you in an earlier letter, if and when a newspaper makes an obvious mistake such as \" Royal College of Surgeons \" it is only polite to the people concerned to print an apology.\nFelix is not ashamed to do this (viz Felix 209), why is Sennet ?\nIn your first issue (209) you appear to have convinced yourself\nthat Sennet sells more copies in I.C. than does Felix. This is not\ntrue. At present Felix sales are 35 per cent, above Sennet's. N.J. WALKER, Editor, Felix.\nDEBATING SOCIETY\nOur lead story in the last issue featured the Debating Society,\nbut due to lack of space no mention could be made of the success\nor failure of the Society this term.\nThere has been little speaking from the floor in any of the debates\nso far. This surely is a disastrous state of affairs. No debate will\nbe lively and entertaining unless people in the audience are prepared to stand up and speak.\nDebating classes are supposed to have started but, as with other\nDebating activities, publicity is abysmal. Only when there is a nucleus of twenty more than adequate speakers will I.C. have any\nsuccess in the U.L. U. debating competition. This year they were\ndefeated in the first round by C.E.M. It was unfortunate that Bill\nMacauly went ill at 5.0 p.m., with the debate starting at 8.0.\nFELIX Felix is back to its normal size this week after two \" bumper\"\nissues. This is due to the lack of advertising, and until we have a grant approaching that of other London Colleges, the size of Felix\nwill continue to be tied to the amount of money our advertising\nbrings in.\nHALDANE LIBRARY\n13, Prince's Gardens\nSorry 1 You won't find textbooks or scientific treatises in\nthis library, but you will find over\n10,000 good books of general\ninterest including all the latest\nnovels!\nAnd it's Free too 1\nOpen 11\u2014531) p.m. and\nuntil 7.0 p.m. on Tuesday\nand Thursday\nKENSINGTONS\nMOST COMPREHENSIVE\nBOOK SERVICE\nNEW BOOKS\nSECOND HAND BOOKS\nPAPERBACKS\nGRAMOPHONE\nRECORDS\nH. KARNAC (Books) LTD\n56-58 GLOUCESTER RD.,\nS.W.7 KNI 7908/0177\ncoL THE TWENTIETH THAT DIDN'T ROAR During the last few years Carnivals have gradually changed from thinly disguised orgies to\nextended hops. This, in itself, is not a bad thing ;\nbut at the same time they have lost more and more\nof their individuality and \" special occasion\"\natmosphere until, on the roaring 20th, not one\nband was produced that did not play all. too regularly at College functions already. Falling attendances indicate that unless more originality is put\ninto their organisation, these once great events will\ndie a slow and painful death.\nSome suggestions: why not replace that film\n(which everyone goes to sleep in) with shorter cartoons shown concurrently with the dancing on a News Theatre basis ? Keep the bands going until\n5 or 6 a.m., and then provide everyone with\nbreakfast. Some years ago, the cabaret was\nsupplemented with a floor show ! Reasonably\npriced bands and groups that have not appeared\nbefore are relatively easy to obtain. More use\ncould be made of the whole Union building.\nFinally, there must be someone somewhere capable of producing a funny cabaret that doesn't completely lack continuity.\nThe possibilities are endless, but Carnival organisation is a gargantuan task, and Ents Chairmen will need all the help they can get.\nThe Refectory Management appears to have\nadopted the regrettable policy of regarding the\nBeit noshing facilities as an unimportant subsidiary of the great Southside Foodworks. That\nthe standard of food and service is much higher\nin Beit is probably best shown by the number of\nSouthside people who eat their evening meals\nthere in exile.\nI am informed that, the Union Cloakroom\nattendants are now q n ly given one day off in\ntwenty-one. In the light of this, it is hardly surprising that the Union finds difficulty in recruiting\nmen to do the job in Southside. The only surprise\nis that we still have any attendants left.\nWHAT THE PAPERS SAY\nCpngratulations to the Felix staff on a really\nfirst rate issue last time\u2014even the problem of\nprinting positive, instead of negative, photos seems\nto have been solved ! Contrast this impressive\neffort with the sadly decaying Sennet. Quite\nhonestly, I can't understand why so many people\nbuy it (No, Sir. . . .) Tuesday morning lectures\ncan't be that bad, and the so-called Gutter Press\nproduces much better pinups and sensational\nstories. The solution, surely, is for the Union to\nprovide a dozen or so copies for the Union\nLoungp. At least there is little likelihood of their\nbeing stolen (Daily Mirror abductors, please note).\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX5 The Colcutt Tower is not a mascot worthy of I.C. This was\nthe feeling that led to a meeting\nof the trophy officers of the three\nconstituent colleges in Falmouth\nHall on Monday November 23rd. A suitable alternative\u2014one\nsymbolic of science and technology\u2014was needed and from\nsome frivolous suggestions finally\nemerged the idea of a micrometer\n\u2022\u2014a five foot long working model.\nBURGLAR PROOF\nIf this idea is accepted in the\nUnion meeting on Thursday 3rd December work will begin immediately in the casting department of Mines. After machining\nin the R.C.S. workshops it will\nbe rendered burglar-proof by\nGuilds and then mounted in its\nplace of honour in the Union\nbuilding.\nTo quote Norman Price \" If\npeople are keen enough to spend\na lot of time and trouble to make\nand look after such a mascot I don't see why we shouldn't have\nit.\"\nCOURT CASE\nOn Tuesday, the eighth day of December 1964 A.D. at 1 p.m. in the Criminal Court, Lecture Theatre \" B,\" Chemistry Building,\nat least two members of RCS will stand trial on a charge of First\nDegree loss of Theta, the sentence for which when the accused are\nfound guilty is the traditional capital punishment of immersion in the\nsacred waters of the Round Pond.\nThe counsel for the (RCS) Crown have, in conjunction with the\nRCS Secret Police and one Bond, James, (Private Eye No. 700) unearthed a plot of incredible complexity, involving most of the members\nof the Executive and several East European powers. Sir Adrian\nFletcher, Q.C., N. I.T., ex-MP. for Beit Hall, and Chief Escalator\nRunner for the Crown, Counsel for the Prosecution, pointed out that\nthe accused were innocent until proved guilty, which of course, they\nwould be at the trial. The Rt. Hon. Mr. Ray Phillips, Q.C., T.W.I.T., also appearing for the Crown, is using his brilliant education in\nChemistry to examine the traces of clothing found on the recovered\nTheta, in the hope of proving the guilt of at least a dozen innocent\npeople-Sir Ted /Needham, Q.C., N.U.R. K., Member of a powerful\nNewspaper Syndicate, for the defence, is so confident of an acquittal\nthat he has invited everyone connected with the trial (including wit-ness es) to a celebration dinner in New York that evening. (N.B. Special\ncharter plane for the guests leaves London Airport at 12.30 a.m.) The\nRt. Hon. Mr. Roger Cook, QC, B.U.R.K., is believed to be en-de av our ing to prove that a previously unknown hypnotic drug,\nextracted from an exceedingly rare flower (Beitus quadra n gul usd and eli um) was put into the wine at the Southside dinner and the\nmembers of RCS present were hypnotised into believing that Theta\nhad been stolen, whereas in fact it had rolled off the table and into\nthe pocket of the President, who, being unaware of its presence, let\nit inadvertently fall into a tin of red and white paint which was in\ntransit to Hotpoint Ltd., whence Theta was retrieved a fortnight\nlater.\nWhatever the outcome of this trial, unprecedented in modern\ntimes, it can be stated that Justice will prevail and not more than two\nhundred witnesses will perjure themselves.\nTO TEACH IS TO CREATE From the time of Socrates, teachers have made\nat least as important a contribution to society's progress as the statesmen, the inventors and\nthe artists. Their influence is now wider, their\nresponsibilities greater than ever before. Today\neducation offers a creative career of increasing\nscope, in which people of ice as and initiative\ncan use their talents and attainments to the full.\nMany exciting new things are happening in the\neducation service . . . things in which you might\ntake part. Ask for the new booklet, C. E.G., at your University Appointments Board, or from\nthe Department of Education and Science,\nCurzon Street, London, W.1 "

    "content": "12 FELIXA.Sc.W. From page 1\nIt formed a student section at\nIC early this year, and was at first\nprimarily concerned with the\nundergraduate syllabus in the\nChemistry Department. At that\ntime there was much dissatisfaction among the students, and the\nI.C.A. Sc.W. took upon itself to\ninvestigate the problem and try to\ndiscuss it with the staff, by-pass-ing the accepted channels of RCS\nUnion.\nImperial College Union (and\nthose of the Constituent Colleges) is noted for lacking any\npolitical leaning. This has been\na source of strength in its relations with the staff.\nUNDERHAND DEALINGS\nLast Thursday I.C.A. Sc.W. held a meeting of Union Year\nRepresentatives and general\nmembers of the Council to discuss the possibility of holding a staff-student conference on \" Lecturing Methods\" at IC. This\nmay be discussed at greater\nlength in to-morrow's Union\nMeeting.\nThroughout their dealings with\nboth the staff and the Union, the\nIC Branch has been not merely\ndiscourteous but underhand.\nKeith Cavanagh stated that written permission had been given to\nconduct the survey. This has\nbeen categorically denied by the\nRegistrar and the President of\nIC Union.\nAlso, no notification of Thursday's meeting was sent to the\nPresidents of IC or the Constiuent\nCollege Unions. Keith Cavanagh\nconsiders that they do not represent general student opinion!\nBut, are they not the elected\nrepresentatives of the students ?\nCavanagh contends that the\nmembers of I.C.A. Sc.W. are\nrightfully \"average members of\nthe Union.\" This is in spite of\nthe facts that, one, the association has not been recognised by\nIC Union, and, two, they have\nonly 160 members, of whom 70\nbelong to RSM (mostly PGs) and\n50 (mostly UGs) are from the\nChemistry department, leaving 40\nrandomly distributed through\nGuilds and the rest of RCS.\nN.J. W.&D. I.W.. ANTI-NUS\nUp to now, the N.U.S. controversy has meant little to me.\nHowever, my wife, who is a student at another London College,\napplied for a Christmas vac. job\nwith the G.P.O., through N.U.S. She was told that only through\nN.U.S. could she obtain a job\nwith the GP.O., that N.U.S. must\nreceive 7/6d. for \" administrative\ncosts,\" and that she must fill in\nvarious cards and forms, all\nmeaningless.\nA journey to the local Post\nOffice produced the necessary application form without cost or\nbother.\nN.U.S. seems to have a chronic\ncase of C. Northcote Parkinson's disease \" Administrates,\" especially in view of its annual\nannual administrative growth of\nabout 6 per cent. Administrative\ncosts soar as shown by their demands for larger subscriptions\nfrom colleges.\nThus I wholeheartedly endorse\nany future anti-N.U.S. motion by\nI.C.( or anyone else).\n(This is a condensation of a much\nlonger article by C.P. BURGESS\n(Chem. P.G.)) SHORT A contraceptive slot machine\nwill NOT be installed in I.C. Union.\n***\nQuote from Deputy President\nBarry Mair, \" I felt such a fool\na polo gi sing to a tape recorder.\"\n***\nAt the Guilds next Union\nmeeting films of recent events will\nbe shown. All (Guildsmen) are\nwelcome.\n***\nFELIX has now more print\nspace per penny than the Daily\nWorker.\nFelix congratulates Miss Kate\nTait on winning the first Joseph\nprize to be awarded. This prize,\nvalue \u00a350, is to be awarded\nannually to female University\nstudents studying Architecture or\nEngineering.\n***\nWhere are the clay pipe meetings which were held in bygone\ndays between the Rector (Sir\nRoderick Hill) and the Union\nOfficers for furtherance of the\nwell-being of I.C.? Scrutiny is out\u2014once again\nprinted but rather thin. It is en-co urging to see that members of\nStaff have written and also that\nthe editorial is a lucid revue\nof Staff-Students in regard to\ntutorials.\nCROSSWORD No I. LACK OF DRESS\nSPOILS ATMOSPHERE\nIt was disappointing that not everybody came in fancy dress to\nthe Guilds-Mines Carnival on 20th November. This rather destroy e.1 the carnival atmosphere.\nThe whole Union building had been taken over for the night\nand there was a constant supply of entertainment. Consequently,\neven after eight hours boredom had not set in.\nDISMAL START\nThe Carnival started dismally. But the arrival of the Saracens\nwith their 100 watts of amplification invigorated all, not least the\nchap near the stage who incessantly made trumpeting noises. One\nof the Saracens nearly lost his temper and guitar, for, at one point\nin the argument, his electric block of wood was poised dangerously\nabove the head of the offender.\nThe Cabaret was disappointing, judging by the remarks I heard.\nThis was largely due to a lack of continuity and unconvincing acting,\ndue perhaps to too little time spent on rehearsals.\nFROGMAN BOND\nHowever, there was one brilliant sketch, very well acted\u2014a satirically revised version of \" Goldfinger \" with Bond attired in frog-man's clothing.\nMore dancing followed the cabaret. The Wayfarers folk singers\nwere suitably soothing for that hour of the morning. Finally the film\n\"Some Like it Hot,\" starring Marilyn Monroe, was very amusing\nto those able to remain awake.\nCarnivals are, undoubtedly, the most enjoyable social function\nat I.C.

The Wayfarers were well\nreceived, very few slept through the film and the Saracens had us\nhypnotized per normal. A large proportion wore fancy dress but only\none couple, a Minesman and his wife, dressed according to the phrase\n\" Black your Bottom.\"\nThe decorations which were excellent, remained in place for the\nMines Hop the following evening. This was most unfortunate for\nthe \" bird spotters\" in the Concert Hall as the light precluded the\nusual eyeing up operation. The bar in consequence did a roaring trade.\nSWIMMING GALA\u2014December 11th. A malicious rumour is circulating that Mines have secretly been\ntraining in a certain bath tub in Southside. This is completely without\nfoundation and has been spread by our opponents in a desperate\nattempt to dampen the enthusiasm in Mines.\nMinesmen beware!! Come and Support your Team!\nTHE FOREIGN STUDENTS' VISIT\nInvitations have been sent to ten students from five European\nMining Schools, Clausthal, Paris, St. Etienne, Delft and Leoben, to be\nentertained by the Royal School of Mines Union. The students will\nbe here from the 15th \u201419th December and a full and comprehensive\nschedule has been arranged. This includes an outing on a typical\n\"Mines Night\" and a visit to Fleet Street on the lines of the \"Prospect\"\ntrip has been suggested. To round off their visit the foreign students\nwill be guests at the Mines Ball.\nTHE MINES BALL This is one of the many occasions on which a Minesman is\nrequired to wear his d.j. A ticket will entitle you to free buffet\nsupper, dancing and a cabaret organised solely by Mines. Tickets are\nalready scarce, it is suggested that one should buy now before the\nblack market becomes operative.\nTUBE RECORD\nDo you get that envious feeling\nwhen yo a read of student expeditions hammering through the\nMalayan jungle or trying to melt\nthe Greenland ice-cap ? D:d yo a know 'ha you can join in such\nhappy at hi ties? Positively no\nLand Rovers, yaks, Sherpas or\noxygen needed. All that is\nneeded is a London Transport\n10/- day rover ticket for the Unde ground and some ingenuity.\nThe idea is to visit all 273\nstations of the London's Underground is as little time as possible-Imagine the interest in venturing\nout to such primeval areas as\nSudbury, Harrow, Hatch End,\nArnos Grove, Shadwell, and\nHanger Lane.\nOne such expedition set out on\nSaturday 21st November. It consisted of Michael Win' lock, of 2\nMech. Eng., with auxiliary transport in the hands of Tony Luxton.\nFortunately, a Sno-cat or Weasel\nis unnecessary, our two gallant\nvoyagers using a grimly experienced Standard 14.\nFighting the cold with thick\nclothing and boredom with books,\ntime-tables, and stop-watches,\nMichael boarded the first Central\nLine train to the wilds of Ongar\nat 5.12 a.m. On arriving at this outpost of\ncivilisation he was whisked by car\nto the frontier station at Upminster, and from here headed\nback to London.\nThis set the pattern for many\nGuildfinger\nThe column born of our age,\nreplacing the old Spannerama.\nThe column that gives you the\nnews and views of Guildsmen.\nLord Mayor's Show\nOn Saturday, 14th November,\nthe populace of London celebrated the ancient and annual\nceremony of the \" Showing of the\nLord Mayor.\" About 100 Guildsmen and exactly one Bo. enjoyed\nthe exhibition. The ladies of\nKing's College were impressed by\nthe quality of the manhood that\nescorted them in the procession.\nThe procession was not halted at\nany time to allow the gentlemen\n\" to urinate in an el d\"( cf.\nSennet).\nand not just 20, had a roaring\ngood time.\nUnion MeeCing\nThe second Union Meeting will\nbe on Thursday, 10th December,\nat 1.00 p.m. in Room 542 in the\nMechanical Dept. There will be\nsport, but this will not include\ntrying to induce a certain D.G.B. to drop Spanner on his H.E.A.D. by throwing chalk at his overt\norifice.\nSwimming Gala\nAnd the next day was calle cj Stanley Tools Ltd., overcome\nwith gratitude because two\nGuildsmen and the new magnum\nsized Stanley Hammer made the\nfront page of a Sunday news-paper, have benevolently presented Guilds Union with an eight\nfoot polystyrene spanner, which\nwill shortly be displayed in the\nGuilds Union Office- (Note to\nR.C.S.& Mines; it's inviolate).\nOne City Gent was delighted to\nlearn that eight Guildsmen \" liked\nhis trousers.\"\nCarnival\nThis years Carnival was up to\nthe same high standard as last\nyears.

He claims this as a new London University record.\nSurely this is the expedition\nfor the home-bound student- No\ntiresome head-hunters, annoyingly\nslippery mountains, and such\nperils.

Gone is dirty old Stynx and its\nson, Old Rope, and in their place it is intended to present a Super\nPhoenix-type of magazine.\nThe old Carnival magazine was a reasonable success down Old\nBrompton Road, Kings Road and the back streets of Fulham. Past\nstandards, however, have been considered to have been of a very\nlow quality and it was decided that either this year's magazine must\nbe based on the same lines but better or be completely different.\nThe 1965 Carnival instead will concentrate on the plusher districts of Kensington where a magazine of a more serious nature\nshould draw greater appeal. It is hoped that contributions may be\nreceived from now-prominent ex-I.C. students.\nGOOD CAUSES\nAt the time of writing four\ncauses have been suggested for\nthe 1965 Carnival charity.

The proposals, believed to be\nthe inspiration of Be it T7 arden Frank Irving, ranged between regular reporting s at inconvenient times, fining, and a temporary weeks expulsion. At last, it seems, the attitude of the authorities to minor hall offences might be clarified. However, the College attitude to law breaking is still unclear. In many cases, the fine imposed by the civilian courts would seem to be enough: indeed, this is what some authorities appear to think. However, the official at ti tude is still rather harsh, and, no\ndoubt, in dir rect ly leads to the feeble participation by I.C. students in Rags, demonstrations, and even in their own Carnival. T.N.

    "content": "FELIX 3\nVenereal Diseases\nWELLSOC, 23rd NOVEMBER\nDr. A. J. Dalzell-Ward, of the\nCentral Council for Heal h Education\nWandering somewhat from\ntheir usual habitat on the fringes\nof modern science, Wellsian (or\nworried ?) minds were brought to\nbear on the very earthy problem\nof V.D. In discussing the medical and social problems Dr. Ward\nbrought out the importance o! educating the public in the subject and hence obtaining their co-operation.\nIn discussing the disease, he\nsaid it was the inability of the\norganisms to survive in other than\nhot and humid conditions that\nconfines its existence to the genital\ntracts and its transfer to the act of\nsexual intercourse. However, if\nthe virus is detected at an early\nstage, modern antibiotics provide\na speedy and complete cure.\nGONORRHEA\nGonorrhea cannot escape detection in the male as it causes a painful obstruction of the urethra\nwithin a week of infection. In the\nfemale however, the symptoms\nmay be masked by natural s ys ICSFRE\nAn I.C. Society tor Racial\nEquality has at last been formed.\nOn the initiative of Keith\nCavanagh, Chairman of IC\nbranch of the Association of\nScientific Workers, a meeting was\nheld on November 19th attended\nby all interested societies. It\nwould take months for the Society\nto receive Union recognition and\nit was agreed that immediate\naction must be taken to ensure that\nthere is a large contingent from\nIC at ULUSARD's Torchight\nRally against Apartheid (held\nlast Monday). There would be\nan intensive leaflet campaign.\nBarry Utting, ICU Secretary,\nwas elected Chairman of ICSFRE\nwith Roy Clark as Secretary and\neight other Committee members.\nAlthough Apartheid in South\nAfrica is the Society's immediate\nmajor concern it was agreed that\nno form of racial discrimination\nwould be overlooked.\n\"Never be persuaded to go on\nany expedition that has anything\nto do with camels.\" This was\njust one of the many witty remarks which punctuated a talk\nby Captain Keith Douglas Young\nof the U.S.A.F. under the auspices of the Exploration Society\nlast Tuesday week.\nCaptain Young, an Australian,\nwho has been in the U.S.A.F. since the last war also stated that\nif anyone bales out from an aircraft \" we guarantee he is going\nto be injured.\"\nterns until the inflammation of\nthe internal channels is considerable and recovery can at best be\nachieved with the di struct ion of\nthe reproductive system.\nSYPHILIS\nSyphilis initially manifests itself\nin inflammation of the mucus\nmembrane, rashes, fever and a local ulcer. These symptoms may\nhowever be overlooked as measles\nof some other common ailment.\nThese symptoms subside with the\ntransfer of the virus into the\nblood- It may be 20-25 years\nbefore it attacks the joints, brain\nor heart (aorta) causing terrible\nsuffering and often death.\nAll countries that have any\nkind of health service are actively\nengaged in trying to eradicate\nthese organisms and the mobility\nof modern man has brought about\nthe need for world-wide co-operation. Much has been done\nbut a great portion of the responsibility lies with the individual. The dangers of the virus\nin a promiscuous society are\nobviously great, and prophylactics provide little safety. Education in schools was Dr. Ward's suggestion; and reading Sennet on\ncontraception, obviously the University must be made aware of\nthe facts.\nNext week back to the fringes\nwith \" FUEL CELLS.\"\nTHE NEW\nIgnorance of the facts of life is one of two important causes of\nillegitimate births, said Sister Marjorie Lewis, of the Welfare section\nof the Methodist Church, at last Friday week's S. C.M. Meeting.\nContraceptives being far from foolproof (as evidenced by the number of unmarried nurses who became pregnant) was given as the\nsecond.\nPROMISCUITY\nThe speaker has long been connected with the problem of\nunmarried mothers, and was thus well qualified to throw out promiscuous sexual relations as never being a good thing.\nThe much misquoted \" New Morality,\" she went on to say does\nnot advocate anything un-Christian, or licentious, but merely treats\npeople as persons, and was a sign that the Church was at last awaking to recognise the place of sex in God's plan. The previous wrong\nattitudes arose from the licentious side of bygone times, and led to\nthe prominence and advocacy of celibacy ; the speaker was not sorry\nthat these ideas had at last gone.\nENGAGED COUPLES\nPatience, discipline and con inen ce were advocated as being\nthe best course for engaged\ncouples, who should not give\nthemselves to each other, out s ile the frame \u00bbor k of \" life together \"\nor marriage. The much quoted\n\" it something goes wrong, we\nwill marry,\" rarely works.\nIf they do marry, they are unlikely to be in a position to\nmanage financially, since an expectant wife or nursing mother\ncannot easily find work. . Very\noften the engagement is broken\noff when the girl becomes pre g nant. The man might realise how\nbadly off he will be financially,\nand the girl, seeing this change\nin him, might not be so sure\nabout his love for her.\nADULTERY\nChristians should obey the\nSeventh Commandment, \" Thou\nThe speaker gave a detailed\ndescription of the small survival\npack he always carried. This included safety pins to repair \"tears\nin strategic places\" and tooth\nbrushes\u2014since after a short time\nyour mouth tastes like \"the inside\nof a Turkish wrestler's jock\nstrap! \" Among other items he\ndescribed were: a midget flare\ngun that shoots 300 ft. in the air,\nfishing line and hooks, and 1001\nother useful items.\nHe described buffalo shooting\n\" from a range of 18 inches \" and\nhis various adventures on illegal\nexpeditions to Mexico and New\nGuinea.\nThe next meeting of the Exploration Society is on Friday,\n11th December.\nshalt not commit adultery.\" Al though in some circumstances\nthis might bring hardships, it\nmust be accepted ; life does not\ngive to all what they want, and if\na girl falls in love with a married\nman, she has no right to his affections. DIVORCE\nThe divorce laws need revision,\nclaimed the speaker, who expressed astonishment at the haphazard way people get married.\nMarriage should not be entered\ninto too lightly, and should be\nconsidered as a lifelong partner-ship.\nHowever, marriages that have\nbroken down, due for example to\nincompatibility, are really no\nlonger marriages any more, and it\nwould be un-Christian not to\nsanction divorce in such cases.\nThe speaker thought that if\nboth parties were practising\nChristians, then they should\nalmost certainly be able to solve\ntheir problems and avoid a di-vor ce, but for those with no\nstrong religious faith this might\nbe difficult. It was felt that the\nChristian teaching on divorce will\neventually prevail, without the\ncensorious holier than them \"\nattitude arising from a wrong\nview of sex.\nTo summarise the general feeling at the meeting, the world has\nnever found a better system than\nthe very old one of \" pre-mari-tal chastity, and post-marital\nfidelity.\"\nGORDON\nLOWEST HE IDEAL SPORTS SHOP\nGOOD DISCOUNTS FOR\nALL I.C.

    "content": "8 FELI X RELATIONS SHATTERED POLITICS GOVERNMENT IN TURMOIL The Labour Government, whom he said was composed of \" nasty\nlittle nationalists,\" have in a surprisingly short lime reduced to shreds\nall the good-will in Anglo-European relations that the previous\nadministration had carefully built up, and it would be years before\nthis confidence could be restored. This was part of the unhappy\npicture presented by the Rt Hon. Edward Heath, O.B. K.,M. P., when\nhe spoke at I.C. last Tuesday week.\nEXAGGERATION\nWith particular reference to the present economic situation, he\naccused the Wilson Administration of causing the present financial\ncrisis, by exaggerating the former situation out of all recognition,\nfor internal political ends.\nA combination of this exaggeration during and immediately\nafter the election, the Labour platform of social reform with doubt\nas to where the money would come from, and the financial ineptitude of previous Labour Administrations, were, Mr. Heath asserted,\nalmost entirely responsible for our Europeon Allies withdrawing their\nLondon investments. This withdrawal of money by foreign banks\nwas the direct cause behind the panic bank rate increase.\nBROTHERHOOD OF MAN IN\nMr. Jeremy Thorpe, the\nLiberal M.P. for North Devon,\npresented a very clear picture of\nthe present political situation\nwhen he came to I.C. to talk on\n\" The Political Scene \" in General\nStudies on 19th November. He\nalso gave his personal views on\nfuture development in politics.\nHe covered a wide spectrum of\ncurrent affairs.\nUnless some formula were\nfound to settle Russia's refusal to\npay her share towards peacekeeping operations, he could see\ncrucial problems ahead for the\nUnited Nations Organisation. He\nDISPLTE\nHe further condemned the unprecedented breaking of G.A.T. T. and E.F.T.A. treaty agreements,\nwhen the Wilson Administration\nintroduced-the 15 per cent, import levy, and asked why, if the\nLabour Government believes in\nthe brotherhood of man, it does\nnot recognize this brotherhood\nacross the Channel.\nHe called Mr. Wilson's European policy \" hypocritical,\" since\nit involved trying to enter the\nCommon Market, \" on condition\nthat the main provisions of the\nCommon Market are abolished.\"\nSMETHWICK\nCONTROVERSY\nWhen questioned on the Smethwick election, he evaded the\nquestion asked, and instead criticized Mr- Patrick Gordon-Walker\nfor watering down the Labour\npolicy on a multiracial State for\npolitical expediency. When\npressed, he refused to say whether\nor not Mr. Griffiths had taken\nadvantage of the situation.\nMr. Heath had plenty to say,\nhowever, on the importance of\nnot surrendering Britain's independent nuclear deterrent; but\nnothing of significance emerged\nin this context.\nCentral Electricity Generating Board\nhas a great future to offer...\nThe Board's ENGINEERING\nTRAINING\nSCHEME\nOpens up exceptional\ncareer opportunities for\nELECTRICAL\nENGINEERS\nMECHANICAL\nENGINEERS\nPHYSICISTS\nTWO YEARS TRAINING. For those with good\nhonours degrees, this will be a general engineering training, including one year with a manufacturer, basic workshop training and experience in\nall aspects of the Board's engineering operations.\nThose with other degrees can be trained in Generation, Transmission or Design and Construction,\nwith 6 months spent at a manufacturers.\nPay during training: 1st and 2nd Class honours\ndegrees \u00a3875 in the first year, and \u00a3925 in the\nsecond year. Other degrees, \u00a3700 in the first year,\n\u00a3750 in the second.\nWHY CHOOSE C.E. G.B.? Because it is an ex-pan ding, essential and progressive industry. The\ndemand for electricity is doubling every eight\nyears. The scope is enormous, with constant new\ndevelopment in all parts of the country, involving\na capital expenditure of over \u00a3300 millions a year.\nPresent plans include 2,000 megawatt power\nstations, 500 megawatt generating sets, 400 kilo-volt transmission lines, nuclear power stations\nand research into magnetohydrodynamics. Excellent progressive salary scale, conditions and\nprospects.\nCAREERS for ENGINEERS are available within\nthe C.E. G.B. in GENERATION, TRANSMISSION\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION or RESEARCH.\nFurther Information about what the Board\ncan offer is available from:\nUNIVERSITY LIAISON OFFICER\nCENTRAL ELECTRICITY\nGENERATING BOARD\n^ud bury House, 15 Newgate Street,\nLondon, E.C.1. or your Appointments Board.\neven feared for its continued\nexistence.\nTHE LIBERAL VE W On some counts at least, the\npresent Governrient evidently\nfinds favour with the Parliamentary Liberal Party. Mr. Thorpe\napplauded the swift moves made\nby Mr. Wilson in the Rhodesian\ncrisis and Labour's reassessment\nof the contract to supply Buccaneer bombers to South Africa.\nBut, the proposed Land Commission was not quite so popular.\nBritish industry received its\nshare of criticism. Mr. Thorpe's main target was the inefficiency\nbred by demarcation and unofficial strikes. Judging by his\nideas on the superiority of continental industry, in the event of a Liberal return to power the Wilsonian \" deadwood in the boardrooms \" would very soon find itself on the dole.\nSWORDS IN THE CHAMBER\nWhen Mr. Grimond visited IC\nthis year, he expressed the sentiment that the structure of Parliament was outdated. Mr. Thorpe\nendorsed this opinion, seeing no\nparticular virtue in a system containing such anachronisms as\nre pul at ions pertaining to the\nwearing of offensive weapons in\nthe Chamber\u2014swords must be\nhung on special hooks provided\noutside!\nDuring the lengthy question\ntime Mr. Thorpe gave, by political standards, an unusually clear\nand cogent set of replies, taking\nthe excellent opportunity of\n\" What is the purpose of a minority party ?\" to point out the\nLiberal role in converting the\nTories to the Common Market\nand the Socialists on defence.\nIn all, his visit provided an illuminating and entertaining hour\non how the third party thinks.\nR.L.

We\ndon't need a film, our image is\npretty well shattered already.\nGAMBLING AT BRISTOL\u2014\nIt is reported that many students\nat Bristol spend \" a large part\"\nof their grants in gambling.\nNaturally, horses are the most\npopular but casinos, greyhounds,\nfootball pools and bingo are also\npopular.\nMENTAL HEALTH AT OXBRIDGE \u2014 A survey at Cambridge has revealed that one in\nseven students is handicapped by\npsychological problems and one\nin twenty is desperately in need\nof specialised psychiatric treat-ment. Similar reports from Oxford reveal.that the admission\nrate of undergraduates for psychiatric treatment at Warneford\nHospital is three times the normal rate for the age group. The\nmain causes of illness are work\nbut 21 per cent, had sexual problems,2 per cent, found lowly\nfamily status an embarrassment,\nand only 25 per cent, were\nsocially at ease\nSOTON SHINE \u2014 Southampton\nUniversity must rank as top University as far as this year's rags\nare concerned. Their bids for\npublicity have met with great\nsuccess, especially their penetration of Parkhurst and their raid\non Roedean.\nWHAT' S THE USE WHATS THE USE ?\nWhy have a Union Executive or Council?\nWhat do they do besides talk and spend my\nmoney ? These are questions which are asked\nby any sensible and interested student at least\nonce during his stay at College.\nUnion Handbook\nDoes the present book contain sufficient information ? I think one giving, in addition to the\npresent details, information on \" how it's done,\"\ninstead of confining this to the few, would be of\nimmense benefit. This development is being considered by Chris Tye at Council's request. Have\nyou any suggestions on content ?\nBookstall\nThis belongs to the Union, started originally by\nyour predecessors' funds. Miss Larcom administers this with great dedication but policy is a matter for discussion by the Bookstall Committee,\nconsisting of a majority of students, who were, for\nexample, looking again into the provision of\ndifferent scarves before, the suggestions made\nearlier in the term.\nDo you want some duplicating done? The\nBookstall employs people specially to provide this\nservice for students. All profits come back to\nyour pockets via the Union general finance.\nEntertainment\nAre you satisfied with the provision of organised\nand disorganised social functions by ICU ? Council is not; and therefore has recommended a change in the organisation of entertainment, so\nthat it has more scope, greater co-ordination and\nbetter facilities. A committee under the Deputy\nPresident is looking into the question now. Do\nyou want more jazz concerts, films at weekends,\ngeneral folk y or R&B evenings ? Suggest!\nDis^gan is ed social facilities have been im\nproved by opening the bars until 11 p.m. in spite\nof cynical and factually unsubstantiated com-ment s. Would you use more indoor games rooms ?\nThis is also being considered.\nRefectories and Bars\nDo you want a greater variety of dishes or a different 'beer, in the bar ? These and other more\nfundamental questions are the concern of the\nExecutive, who, after considering economic and\nother complications, will make the appropriate\nrecommendations.\nThe Name of IC Students\nFollowing bad reporting in Sennet, which was in\nsome cases libellous and untrue, a motion was\npassed in the University Presidents' Council, with\nthe active support of myself, condemning the sensationalism and inaccuracy and demanding im-prove ment. Libraries\nHave you a record player or the ability to\nread ? You might perhaps use the Haldane\nLibrary which has recently received a grant from\nthe Union for records to be chosen by your representatives, as well as its usual sum for books.\nDo you own a car, scooter, bicycle or merely\nthe hope to afford one ? A car parking and traffic\ncommittee was established last year (hardly, there-fore, a Council regular) to investigate the problems presented by these vehicles\u2014I put the stu-dents' point of view.\nExternal Relations\nNo Union is perfect, and improvement can often\nbe gained by comparison with other organisations.\nAlready this year two German Technical Universities and the other two British S.I.S.T.E.R.S. have\nvisited IC.\nUnion Buildings\nNew chairs for the lazy (like me).\nNoticeboards for the interested (like you).\nA coffee machine for the thirsty (like Bishop).\nA cigarette machine for the dying (like\nSadhvani).\nPaintings for the cultured (like Utting).\nRadio for the deaf (like Mair).\nAnd Yards of Ale for the minors (like Kearns)\n\u2014these are all included in this year's work.\nMaybe these points answer the original questions\u2014all the examples, along with many other\nmatters affecting you directly, have been discussed\nand acted on either at a Council meeting or the\nmany Executive meetings held this term.\nMake your suggestions either to the appropriate\npeople or through the columns of your Union\nNewspaper (not the rag from Malet Street) or even\nin desperation, stand for election next year.\nHALL ENTRY!\nThis year it seems that fewer\nstudents holding various posts\nhave entered Halls of Residence.\nFor example, the sailing, hockey\nand tennis club had some difficulty in getting their leaders into\nHall. I.e. President, Norman\nPrice, has sent a circular to the\nclubs and societies inquiring\nwhether their captains, secretaries, etc., are hi HaFl Ihs results of this survey are awaited\nwith interest.\nGenerally, a candidate for Hall\nentry has: his application considered by the Hall Committee,\npredominately an elected student\nbody. On the face of it this seems\nan excellent system.\nHowever, last summer the\nCommittees seem to have chosen\nentry candidates more on their\npromise of being act f ve workers\nfor the Hall. At first there seems\nlittle wrong in this, but it is really\na very short-sighted attitude.\nNOT AN ISLAND\nHalls are not an island amidst\nthe rest of the community. They\nhave not a responsibility to themselves alone but to the College as\na whole. Only one-fifth of I.C. students are in Hall, and the Halls\nhave a responsibility to the majority outside.\nOften the only extra-curricular\ncontact many of the students outside have with the College are the\nCollege Clubs\u2014sporting, social\nand recreational. To force the\nleaders of these clubs to live outside the College can only impair\ntheir functions as club leaders\nand their value to the College\ncommunity.\n\" HALL SPIRIT\"\nThus, it seems that the Hall\nCommittees are considering for\nentry candidates more on their\npotential as \" good chaps for the\nHall \" than the equally important aspect of the value of entry\ncandidates to the College as a whole. The development of the\nHall spirit and unity is one of the\nmost exciting aspects of College\nlife at present, but it must not obscure the importance of the\nUnion to our community- It is to\nbe hoped that this is not round\none in a Hall-Union battle.\nP.H. CARTWRIGHT\n\n"
