    "content": "News Felix 910 30 September 1\n9\n9\n1\nDaylight Robbery ^ m? Twelve thousand pounds worth of equipment were stolen in one\nevening from college premises\nduring the summer. The theft in\nAugust was particularly blatant; two\ncomputers, an oscilloscope and\nseveral charge amplifiers were\ntaken from a single room in the\nCivil Engineering department.\nAccording to college security\nthere were no signs of a break-in on\nthe digitally locked door. The theft\ncan be timed to at least the nearest\nhalf hour, as a printer on a recurring\ntwenty minute cycle produced a10 pm readout but not a10.20 one.\nA college security spokesman said\nthat up to thirty-seven people knew\nthe lock combination and stated 'a more selective access system is\nrequired.'\nThe civil engineering theft was\nnot an isolated incident. Late in\nAugust a computer was stolen from\nthe Bessemer Building, in addition\nthere have been numerous wallet\nthefts during the summer vacation\nand several answer machines have\ngone missing.\nCollege security are also\nconcerned about the ease of access\nto some college residences. Head of\nsecurity, Terry Briley, recommends\nthat students get to know as many\npeople in their hall as possible and\nthat they challenge any strangers on\nsight.\nStudent Hardship\nFifty percent rise in students seeking help over summer\nStudents have experienced greater\nhardship this summer than in\nprevious years according to figures\ncompiled by the Union Welfare\noffice. An example includes the\nnumber of students seeking financial assistance which trebled in\nJuly and September compared to the\nsame time last year. According to\nStefano Ruis, who took up the post\nof Welfare Officer at the beginning\nof September, there has been a fifty\npercent rise in the total number of students seeking help over the\nsummer months.\nThe problems facing many\nstudents were firmly rooted in\nfinancial in security.' The withdrawal of housing benefit\nmeant students lost a lot of help they\nwould otherwise have had,' he said.\nHe is very concerned that once\nmoney required for such necessities\nas food, rent, books, bills, poll tax\nand so forth are set aside from the\nstandard grant, there is a very\nconsiderable shortfall. ' The socalled compensation for the loss of\nhousing benefit (ie student loans)\ndoes not really address the issue,'\nclaims Stefano. He advises students\nto 'budget unless they're going to\nget into serious debt.'\nFor those that are already in\nfinancial difficulties or who think\nthat they soon will be, Stefano can\narrange debt counselling and can\neven help negotiate with creditors.\nThis was a service that was run by\nhis predecessor, Y ve Posner, and\none that he hopes to continue.\nStefano is concerned that worries\nover money will affect not just\nstudents academic performance but\nalso their emotional well being,\n'Debt always does' he added.\nAccording to as yet unpublished\ngovernment figures that have been\nmade available to Felix staff, which\ninclude the administration costs of the student loan scheme, the\ngovernment is making as much as\na fifty percent saving by abolishing\nhousing benefit and holiday income\nsupport for students. The government appear to be expecting\nstudents to pick up the tab in the\nform of large overdrafts. \u00a33,000\ndebts are not unheard of amongst\nthird year students at Imperial.\nStefano fears that current student\nfinancing will 'discourage students\nfrom poorer families from going\ninto higher education unless they\nare prepared to be saddled with\nlarge overdrafts.'\nDuring the summer a previously\nunknown Imperial College based\ngroup called 'Academics For Free\nSpeech', ( A FFS) produced a four\npage A5 leaflet concerning the gas\nchambers at Auschwitz and Majdanek, used to exterminate 6\nmillion Jews during the Second\nWorld War. The anti-semitic nature\nof the material roused concern\nthroughout Imperial as it claimed to\nbe 'printed and published by\nAcademics for Free Speech, Imperial College, London.' Felix was made aware of the\npublication and its contents by a local newspaper in South Shields on\nthe north east coast of England. The paper received the leaflet in the post\nin mid-August and immediately\ntelephoned Felix to find out if the\nprinting work was done by the\nImperial College Union Print Unit,\npart of the Felix office. Having no\nknowledge of the publication, Felix\nmade enquiries around the College,\nall of which drew a blank.\nThe publication described the\nfindings of Fred Leuchter, the US execution equipment expert, and\nmentions David Irving, the\ncontroversial 'revisionist' historian.\nThe material, of a highly antisemitic nature, supported the\nfindings of Leuchter's report which\nclaims that in no way could the\nchambers at the concentration\ncamps have been used for the\nexecution of such a number of\npeople within the time span of the\nwar. It also severely attacks the\nvarious groups that have been\noutraged by his report and the book\nbased on it.\nOn hearing about the document,\nthat had been faxed to Felix, the\nRector, Sir Eric Ash, said that T cannot believe that this is Imperial\nCollege Academics' and continued\nby saying that 'There are a lot of n utters at Imperial College, but I cannot believe it came from here'.Senior administrative staff\nwere extremely surprised when\npresented with a copy of the\npublication and comments varied\nfrom 'this is the first I 've heard of\nit' to 'we will be looking into it'.\nImperial College Security Officer, Terry Briley, thought that\nthe document could be considered\nto be 'an incitement to racial\nhatred', illegal under British law.\nHe claimed that one of the\ngovernment's security departments\nhe called 'special operations' was\ninterested in the case.\n\n"

'Most\ntutors are not thinking of becoming\nteachers when they take part. But\nthere is evidence that for every one\nwho is put off, two are\nencouraged', explains John Hughes.\nThe scheme is designed as more\nof a promotion of science and\ntechnology. One of the difficulties\nfacing industry at the moment is the\nsmall proportion (50%) of school\nchildren who opt to continue their\neducation past 16, particularly in\nscience subjects. BP, convinced that\npeer tutoring is a solution, began\nsponsoring a new fellowship at\nImperial College in October 1990.\nJohn Hughes, a former peer tutor\nand teacher for ten years, was\nappointed to develop the tutoring\nscheme, in science and maths,\naround the country.\nToday, peer tuition is widespread\naround the United States, and\nthanks to BP, is spreading rapidly\nin Britain. Imperial has helped over\nfifteen third level institutions,\nincluding Cambridge, Warwick\nUniversity and Nottingham and\nBrighton Polytechnics, University\nof East Anglia, Trinity College,\nDublin, and University College\nLondon, to set up their own schemes.\nStudents volunteering at the start\nof the Autumn term usually visit the\nschool they have been assigned to\non Wednesday afternoons, during\nterm time, until March. Most tutors\nhave a one day training session at\ncollege, at the beginning of the\nacademic year. It is not a case of being thrown ' in at the deep end'; tutoring does not involve looking\nafter a class of2030 kids, single\nhandedly. The desired effect is the\nopposite; providing extra help\nwithin a class. Such help is given\nby working with small groups of children, under the direction and\nsupervision of the class teacher,\nwho is still legally responsible for\nthe welfare of the pupils. Individual\nwork with gifted, remedial, or\ndisruptive pupils, leaves the\nteachers free to help others. Roger\nNicholls, head of maths at Pimlico\nSchool, again in the Independent,\nadmits that 'one afternoon a week\nwe actually get the number of pupils\nto teachers right. Really we need\nhelp like this all the time. At the\nmoment it's a luxury, but it\nshouldn't be.' Under the guidance of John\nHughes, IC's Pimlico Connection\nsent just under one hundred students\na week to primary and secondary\nschools around the capital last year.\nAt the end of last term, tutors and\npupils alike were asked to fill in\nquestionnaires.\nShaShika, age nine, from The Fox Primary School, writes;\n'students have not only helped me but they have helped the whole\nclass. They understand how we feel\nso if we don't understand something, they repeat what they\nhad said. They explain things very\nclearly and they give joy to us just\nto listen to them.' Rachel Hopping,\nfrom the same school, writes; 'the\nstudents knew exactly how we took\nthings in, because they had been\nchildren, not too long ago. They\nknew the words that were easy for\nus to understand and they used\nthem, (which sometimes teachers\nforget).' A sim writes; T wish they\nwould stay and teach us more about\nscience and I would like to say that\nI really enjoyed it and think they\nshould be paid like teachers.'\nSaadi As mi,a third year Chemistry undergraduate writes; T started on the Pimlico Connection\nScheme in my final year at\nImperial\u2014and regretted not having\ndone so any earlier. It was one of the most enjoyable times I have had\nat college.'\nSo whether, a budding teacher, a future captain of industry or\nundecided, the Pimlico Connection\nis for you. It only requires one or\ntwo hours a week of your time,\nbetween October and March.

    "content": "Music Felix 910 30 September 1\n9\n9\n1\nWhat follows is a reasonably\naccurate account of a boy's own\nadventure. Disconcerted and bereft\nof any desirable challenge, our\nintrepid (and imaginative) writer\nsought that most rare and awesome\ncreature, rock's most potent siren\nand the current darling of the music\npress. Sonic Euph talks to Cranes'\nAlison Shaw.\nIt does occur to me, though, that\nhowever much you try to appear\nordinary, your music points towards an isolationist stance.\n' How do you mean?' Awkward silence.\nEr, it's not terribly approachable\nmusic. It's oppressive.\n' Maybe, but, we are reasonably\nnormal people'.\nBut you have said of your music\nthat it may seem dark, but there'sI preferred 'Tender Prey'. ' The Mercy Seat' is one of my personal\nfavourites.\n' Yes, but I like the fact that He uses strings and piano on ' The GoodSon\".1' I agree. It adds a new dimension\nto his music, but I can still go back\nand lose myself in 'Junkyard'.\nThe word ' Yeah!' right now\nsounds like I 've found a kindred\nspirit - but...\nThe Cranes Interview\nSurprise of this particular week\nNo.1. Guns 'n' Roses get Single\nof the Week in Melody Maker.\nSurprise No. 2. Cranes don't. This\nis the same music press that\nregularly attempts to convince us\nthat Levitation are more of a household name than, say, Right\nSaid Fred (gay bouncers are a big\ntopic down our way, I can tell you).\nIt never ceases to amaze me that\nidolatrous and gushing prose is\nwritten by people whose only aim\nseems to be caging Cranes under a ridiculously small name. I suppose\nwe're all guilty of it from time to\ntime, but fingers seem to point\nconstantly at them, in unison with\ncries of Bauhaus, Cocteaus, My\nBloody Valentine, et cetera ad\ninfinitum. Whatever the\nimplications, they're keeping the\ntruth to themselves. Are they\noperating a master plan? strategic\nconcessions to the press and,\nthereby, the public?\n' No.I mean, We signed to\nDedicated in March last year, did\nTnescapable'that summer, toured\nHolland; Dedicated wanted an L.P. before Christmas, but we said we\ncouldn't do it. We started making\nthe L.P. this summer'.\nI have to confess that it seems\nimprobable that You would produce\na long-form video; though quite\ndistinct from my perception of you,\nit feels too soon.\n' Well, it's not really. The video\ncontains four promos, some footage\nfrom ' SNUB', and a home movie'.\nFair enough, I think. That\nanswers that one. DoI venture for\na big ice- breaker? The trouble with\n'phones is... they're 'phones.\nAmerica loves 'em. They won't love Cranes, though. So, how does\nAlison react to the purple prose of\nour lovely music press?\nT don't understand it'.\nMm mm. It gushes. It's over the\ntop.\n' Yeah, I don't like-'\n( EDITED INTERJECTION)' Ha ha. You' ll never get Me to\nsay that. No,I can't relate it to what\nwe do'.\nalways a light at, ahem, the end of\nthe tunnel; I don't get that, I don't experience that with your music.\nOh dear. Laughter. I laugh back.\nWhat?\n' Well, you don't sound like a Cranes fan. Don't you like us?'\nNo, no, I assure her. I love your\nRight. Lesson for today. How to\nbreak a newly- established affinity\nwith a Rock Star. Aska question\nwith the word ' Goth' in it.\nHow do you react when the name\n' Goth' is fired at you?\nT don't know; I mean, what most\npeople think of when they hear\nmusic. I think you're the most\noriginal 'band' around. Cranes are\ngreat. Readers, I mean that most\nsincerely. Cranes are gorgeous.\nO.K., so there is a certain extent\nwith 'Adoration' with the major\nchords three minutes through the\nsong, but the main reason is your\nvoice.\n'Thank you. It's nice of you to\nsay it'.\nI'm charmed. I mean it. Now I 've\nalluded to it, how do I avoid that\nquestion? I don't. Where does the\nvoice come from, by the way? I mean, it's described here as 'foetal\nkeening'(promotional notes to you\nlot).\n' Oh god, P.R.O.D.. It's just my\nvoice, y 'know. All that 'child-like'\nstuff is just irritating'.\nThe problem is, it can't be\ndenied. She sounds so affected in\nthe songs. I make a discreet move\ntowards the pigeonhole marked\n'another tack'. It seems to me that\nmost of the bullshit said about\nCranes revolves around their\npresumed antecedents - Swans, The\nBirthday Party, Bauhausl I don't know where they get Bauhaus\nfrom.\n' Well, I used to listen to The\nBirthday Party, but not any more'.\nYou still like Nick Cave, though.\n' Oh, I liked ' The GoodSon\".' Goth' is the Mission and the\nNephs, and to Me that's more like\nheavy rock'.\nMmrp,, The Sisters. It's merely\nanother name for heavy metal. It\nused to mean The Birthday Party,\nJoy Division, U.K. Decay, even\nDiamanda Galas. These, and their\ndescendants, are collectively known\nas the avant-garde. Diamanda's another of your comparisons.\nDiamanda Galas and Lydia Lunch, by association, seem to have\nprovoked a line of inquiry concerning your past, and\nchildhood traumas.\nT don't wish to discuss it, but it\nwas relatively normal'.\nYes. It's more of a case of a personal response to something,\nbecause it is nothing unless it affects\nsomething. Even so, this question\nhas accused your fans of a sadistic\nvoyeurism because of the presumed\nnature of the music.\n'Well, any listener is a voyeur of\nsorts. It all depends on your\napproach'. This is undeniable.\nAlso, I have been given, on\noccasion, to sadistic thoughts when\nlistening to music. All About Eve,\nfor instance, or Tanita Tikaram. My sadism as regards Alison, I'm given\nto understand, is through my interest in her failed catharsis and\nthe necessary self-inflicted pain of\nthe failure. Again, the voice of\nAlison Shaw is held to be a catalyst\nfor the protective instincts of men.\nWhat I think, however, is that this\nparticular instinct is merely a 'sub-heading', so to speak. But this isn't up for debate. Not on the 'phone on\na monday afternoon, anyway.\nShit. I hate 'phones. This is my\nfirst ' phone interview. And probably my last.\n'It'sO. K.. It's like a chat'.\nBut it's so much better one-to-one. I suppose You must be really\npuritanical with your product,\nmusical dictatorships and all that.\n' To an extent. Jim writes all the\nmusic, but it's very much a gut\nreaction thing'.\nOriginality without contrivance.\nA slippery bastard, but\n'Adorations/Brighter' had a very\nspontaneous feel.\n' The first vocal take for\n'Adoration' was the one we used.\nIt's mostly like, I hear the music,\nand sing whatever words come into\nmy head'.\nGloriously honest. Fantastically\nnatural. Almost auto-suggestion,\nbut with distinct personalities. Even so, 'Adoration' feels slightly more\ncontrived than 'Fuse or 'Self Non Self( both recorded on 8-Track in\n1986). The transience of Cranes'\nsound, a very definite thing, is not\ngazing at it's own future. Her voice\nwas more raw in 1986, but this is\nnot base camp, if you' ll pardon the\npun.\n' When we first started, we used\nto bash around in a garage, and you\nhad to scream to be heard - but I couldn't say where we're going...'\nThere is, it seems, some slight\ntruth in the inspiration through\nadversity with Cranes. Their home\ntown, Portsmouth, they found\nparochial and claustrophobic. They\nwere the classic struggling artists;\npoverty has often invoked great\ninspiration. So, has their fame\nbrought that sterile kind of wealth\ntheir way?\n' No. We're still poor. I only get\n\u00a360 per week'.\nOh dear. Evidently, You' re not\nselling enough records. I feel\nresponsible; I shall therefore extol\nYour virtues to the record-buying\npublic.\n' Oh, please!'\nCranes are like the favourite toy\nfor our music press. It's the one\nthey're never allowed to play with.\nThey beg, whine and sulk; but if\nthey got their hands on it, they\nwould break it and throw it back.\nCranes' album, 'Wings Of Joy', is out now on Dedicated, and\nCranes play London U.L. U. on\nOctober 11th. Come and spend a day in Alison's house.\nSONIC EUPH\n\u2014 5 \u2014\n\n"

Imperial College SherfieldBuilding SWT\nWHEREVER YOU'RE BOUND, WE'RE BOUND TO HAVE BEEN.\nSL/i ULU TRAVEL\neditor i a Welcome to Imperial College! The first weeks at this college for both\nundergraduates and postgraduates\ntend to become a homogenous\nsweaty amalgam of discovery and\nmistakes. Still, enjoy the novelty\nwhile you can, and ensure that you\ndon't waste the future years here\nmerely working for your degree or\nPhD or whatever.\nThe Student Union\nThe college's Student Union is an\norganisation geared towards student\nwelfare. It is a service which exists\nto help you, but can only do this if you ask of it, as nobody who works\nthere is capable of telepathy. The Union is not a trade union, it has\nno political affiliation, either to the\nright or the left. Imperial College's Student Union is not a member of the NUS the National Union of Students, an issue which will almost\ncertainly be more fully aired in the\nfuture. The point about this diatribe\nis to emphasise that the Union is\nthere for you, and it should not be\navoided because you have a vague\nsuspicion that it is a hotbed of radical politics, the slimy tentacles\nof which will never relinquish their\nhold, because it's not and it won't. Avoiding an organisation which\ncould help you because of the\npossibility that something you may\ndiss approve of may have occurred\nonce is plainly stupid.\nThe Union is also responsible for\nthe running of the snack bar (also\nvariously termed the union cafe,\ncaterpillar cafe or lounge bar), the\nUnion Bar, the organisation of entertainment and a number of day\nto day activities all of which benefit\nstudents, many of whom are\nunaware of the contribution that the\nUnion makes. I have met many\nstudents who have convinced themselves that they have led a life\ntotally untainted by the union, even\nthough they have eaten food from\nthe bar and read this student union\nnewspaper.\nFelix - the student newspaper\nFelix is the name of the college\nnewspaper. It is technically the\nStudent Union newspaper, but its\nscope is by no means limited to\nunion affairs and nor is it beholden\nto the Union Office as to what is\nprinted. It is an independent\ncommentator on the college, and\nreports on national and international\nmatters relevant to IC students.\nThe only people it is beholden to\nare the students of Imperial. Felix\nhas a sabbatical editor - me, Adam Harrington and two other\npermanent members of staff. There\nis no conceivable way that these\nthree could research, write, typeset,\nproof, paste up and print a reasonably sized Felix every week\nand depends entirely on student\ninput to run. We are on the map -in the central pages - come and see\nus. It is infinitely the most\nfascinating part of the college, if not\nthe entire galaxy. It is not a club,\nit is not a clique, there are no\npeculiar entry rituals.\nDeadlines\nI hereby give general notice that the\ndeadlines for features, letters,\nwhat'son bits, small ads or anything else is 12.00 midday the\nMONDAY before the Friday that\nFelix comes out on. For example,\nif you hand in an article on\nThursday, it will get into Felix not\nthat week, but the week following.\nIf you hand it in on Friday or\nMonday, it will get into the Felix\nof the following Friday. If the\ndeadline is not kept to, I will not\ngive any guarantee of inclusion\nirrespective of how urgent it is.\nWhat's On\nI haven't included a comprehensive\nwhat's on page in this issue.

    "content": "30 September 1\n9\n9\n1 Felix 910 Union Page Welcome back (or to those who are\nnew...welcome) to IC for yet\nanother exciting term filled with\nfun, frolics, joy and laughter, all\nprovided to you by your friendly,\ncaring, sharing Union. I hope you\nhad a great holiday, as I didn't!O h well, a president's life is a lonely\none... boo hoo. Now, down to\nbusiness.\nUnion Office\nThose of you who have been used\nto slouching around the dingy\nbrown Union office in the North\nEast corner of Beit Quad will be\nsurprised to find that it is no longer\nthere. It has miraculously moved to\nthe central staircase and is now\nbright and welcoming with a comfortable reception area for you\nto sit in, drink coffee, read\nnewspapers, or one of the many\nwelfare information leaflets which\nhave now been placed there, or\neven talk to Michelle or Cathy (the\nvery friendly administrative staff).\nShould you wish to speak to any of\nthe sabbaticals then you need only\nask Michelle or Cathy to let you\nthrough the gate and we'll be very\npleased to see you.\nWelfare Service\nElsewhere in this issue you will\nhave seen that we have a new\nwelfare adviser: Stefano Ruis joined\nus at the beginning of September\nand has lots of new ideas (including\nnew longer opening hours!) to\nimprove the service provided. If\nyou have any questions about\nwelfare then come into the office\nand either pick up a leaflet or speak\nto Stef, he's very approachable and\nis a 'very, very nice man'. Stefano Ruis is\nthe Union's new\nWelfare Advisor.\nExternal Affairs\nLots of things have happened over\nthe past year to make life for\nstudents that little bit harder. Firstly\nthe grant has been frozen to make\nway for the student loan, secondly\nall student benefits have been\nstopped. In order to register the\nstudent opinion of these changes,\nthe University of London Union has\norganised a Hallowe'en sleep out on\n(you guessed it!) Hallowe'en. There\nwill be more info nearer the date,\nbut if you have suffered over this\nsummer then it is well worth getting\ninvolved to prevent other students\nfrom suffering the same fate.\nWelfare\nFor too long, student welfare issues\nhave been ignored at IC. Hopefully\nthis won't happen this year. There\nare two main avenues for Welfare\nconcern:\n1. Educating and Informing\n2. Campaigning for better services\nThe first is to be tackled by a series\nof Welfare campaigns on specific\nissues. The first of these will be a general Educational Welfare Week planned to introduce new students\nto Health and Welfare issues that\nshould concern them (such as\nFitness, Eating, Health and Finance). This is to take place over\nthe 5th week of term (so long away,\nyou say!). So it gives you a chance\nto learn lots of bad habits before\nspanking you and teaching you how\nto do it right!\npositions, write a manifesto quick!\nI realise that there are already some\nstructures in existance within\ndepartments and we would rather\ntap into those structures than ignore\nthem.\nParking Permits\nApplication forms are now available\nfor students wishing to apply for a parking place on campus. I must\nwarn you that competition is\nhigh\u2014there are only 100 permits to\ngive out and they are distributed on\na means tested basis so if you live\nwithin 30 minutes journey of\ncollege and have no special\ncircumstances then you are not\nlikely to get one so don't bother\napplying. You can pick up your\nform from the Union Office and\nthey are due in by 5pm Friday 12th October.\nNews from the Home Front\nZoe Hellinger,\nICU President,\ntries valiantly to\nsound\ninteresting.\nRead for\nyourself\nThe second can only happen if the\nUnion is informed of matters which\nshould be tackled. If you have any\nworries about how you are treated\nwhilst at college then I need to know\nin order to do anything about it.\nThis can be done either via a Union General Meeting ( U GM) or by\ntalking to any of the sabbaticals\npersonally.\nPostgraduates\nA series of special interest lectures\nhave been arranged for\npostgraduates, the first of which\ntackles ' How to choose a PhD, subject' and will be publicised\naround departments closer to the\ndate. There will also be a meeting\nheld in each department at the\nbeginning of term to which all\npostgraduates are invited, to begin\nsetting up a support and social\nnetwork within college. At these\nmeetings we will elect a 'Departmental Representative' who\nwill be responsible for collecting\nand disseminating information\nwithin the department. So if you are\ninterested in holding one of these\nFinally\nIf you care about the quality of your\nlife whilst you're here at IC then it\nis your responsibility to get\ninvolved in the Union. Joining\nclubs, using the Union facilities\n( Bar, Snack Bar, Discos, Bookstore, Welfare Advice) is a major part of the involvement\nnecessary to have a happy life here\nand to improve your employment\nprospects, it is also virtually\nimpossible to avoid using these\nfacilities which the Union provides\nfor you. Another method is by\nbecoming interested in how it is\nrun, whether the sabbaticals are\ndoing their jobs effectively, whether\nimportant things are being missed,\nwhether students are being treated\nfairly. If you aren't interested then\nit is your own fault if you get a bad\ndeal in life.\nThat's the rant over with, there'll\nbe plenty more where that came\nfrom as the year progresses...All\nI'd like to do now is wish everyone\na great;. ,;ar at college and hope that\nyou all make the most of it.\n\u2014 4 \u2014\n\n"

    "content": "30 September 1\n9\n9\n1 Felix 910 Feature\nJohn Simpson\nDear Fresher,\nWelcome to Imperial College.\nThe next three or four years should\nbe among the most interesting and\nenjoyable in your life, provided you\nmake the most of the opportunities\navailable at university. This open\nletter aims to give you some ideas\nfor your own self-development.\nYou can probably recall one of\nthe significant steps in your life\nwhen you entered the sixth form or\nwent to sixth form college. Coming to university is an even more\nsignificant step. You have more\nfreedom, more independence and\nmore opportunities to do your own\nthing and to succeed or fail. If you\ndo not make some mistakes you will\nnot have learnt anything, learning\nfrom one's own mistakes is an\nimportant part of experience, but\ndon't waste time re-inventing\neverything\u2014build on the experience\nof others\u2014take advice (it's usually\nfree)\u2014ignore some of it, test it out,\naccept or reject it.\nYou have already demonstrated\nsome planning ability by passing\n' A' levels\u2014or their equivalent\u2014\nsufficiently well to be at College.\nHow are you going to plan the next\nthree, four or six years? And I'm not talking just about your academic\nstudies, I'm talking about the start\nof the rest of your life. Setting\nobjectives some people call it.\nIf your short-term objective is to\ndo as little work as possible and\nyour medium-term objective is to\nscrape a pass, and your long-term\nobjective is to be idle and poor, then\nthere is no conflict. But if you have\ngrander long-term objectives you\nwill have to modify your short and\nmedium-term objectives.\nBy the end of the summer term\nin your first year you may be feeling\nthe financial pressures\u2014in other\nwords you're probably broke! So\nhow about earning some good\nmoney in the long vacation? If you\nleave job hunting until the vacation\nstarts you may be too late. All the\ninteresting and lucrative jobs have\nbeen filled already and you will be\nlucky if the local council wants\nsome grass cutting or the garden\ncentre needs a dirty pair of hands.\nIt's well worthwhile doing some\npreliminary job hunting between\nChristmas and Easter. Call in at the\nIC Careers Advisory Service( Room 310, Sherfield Building)\nwhere you will find information\nabout Vacation Training, write to\nemployers with your CV, call in to\nsome local shops and hotels and see\nwho's advertising in the local press.\nVacation jobs can be most\ninformative. Ideally they give you\nan insight into the type of work you\nmay be interested in when you leave\ncollege. They give you experience\nin job hunting, letter writing and\ninterviews, as well as a real insight\ninto what it's like to work for a particular type of employer. Some\neven pay you quite well. Jobs\nabroad are popular and early\napplications are essential. Start by\nvisiting the IC Careers Advisory\nService which has a good range of\nreference books and addresses.\nAt the start of the second year you\nraise your sights higher. Now is the\ntime to test your skills in organising\nsomething\u2014a social evening for\nyour department, looking after the\nfinances of a society or fixtures\nsecretary of your team. That sounds\ntoo much like hard work, I hear you\nsay. Yes, it does take some effort\non your part but generally speaking\nthe more effort you put into\nsomething the more enjoyment you\nwill get out of it.\nCommittee work is excellent\npreparation for life after College.\nYou learn to set agendas, run\nmeetings, agree actions, persuade\nother students to do things, work\nwithin budgets and end up with a successful event\u2014a party, a visit,\na play or a newspaper.\nYou should start thinking seriously about your future career\nbefore the end of the second year.\nEven if you haven'ta clue what you\nwant to do, that's no excuse for\ndelaying finding out about the\npossibilities. You are surrounded\nwith sources of information friends, family, tutors, careers\nadvisers, libraries. Start looking. It\nmay be a long process but so is life,\nso it really is worth spending more\ntime thinking about your career than\nplanning your next weekend or\nholiday.\nThe IC Careers Advisory Service\nis a good starting place. Pop in and\nspeak to the information officer.\nFind out about 'Gradscope' and all\nthe information booklets and\nreference files. Have a look at some\nof the videos, attend some seminars\non careers, get yourself sorted out.\nChristmas vacation courses are a popular way of finding out about\ncareers such as marketing, but only\na few major recruiters run them and\nthey are normally over-subscribed\nmany times. The Careers Research\nAdvisory Centre ( C RAC) runs a series of 'Insight Into Management'\ncourses which are also a popular\nway of finding out about\nmanagement careers.\nStop! I'm only a fresher\u2014why\nare you telling me all this?\nI'm telling you because you need\nto start planning your life now,\ndon't just drift through College and\nemerge with a degree and nothing\nelse. Of course a degree is\nimportant and must be your first\npriority, but not your only priority.\nIn the meantime, enjoy yourself.\nJohn Simpson. Last year the college administration\nhad another of its periodic binges\nof cost-cutting.' As ever, the\nadministration started on\nunnecessary fripperies such as\nstudent, facilities, streamlining\ncollege expenditure to the barest\nminimum, namely the generous\nsalaries awarded to the ranks of\nfaceless bureaucrats for whom the\ncollege exists. One of the facilities\nput under the sword was the\nCareers Advisory Service ( CAS). There was a struggle from which\nthe CAS emerged shaken, though\nnot severely damaged, except that\nthe CAS was to d is affiliate from the\nUniversity of London CA SUL CAS. This meant that Dr Russ\nClark, the then Director of the\nservice, who was provided by\nUL CAS, had to leave.\nBut if we had not lost Dr Clark,\nwe would not have gained Mr John\nSimpson, who became the director\nof ICC AS earlier this summer.\nJohn Simpson joined ICI in\nTeesside as a student engineer - an\napprentice - straight from school. In\n1959 he started a degree course in\nMechanical Engineering at Imperial\nCollege, graduating in 1962. He then returned to ICI at Teesside to\nmanage a chemical plant. In 1967\nhe moved to ICI London headquarters at Millbank for three\nyears, working in personnel, and\nthen another six years in Teesside\nworking with white collar unions.\nHe spent three years with ICI in\nBrussels, travelling widely, working with expatriates and\nworking on salary surveys - that is\nthe comparison of salaries to\nrational i sewage levels for\nemployees. In 1979 he returned to\nMillbank, London as an ICI\ngraduate recruitment manager.\n'I 've been a bit of a corporation\ngipsy', he told Felix, '...but I 've\nalways taken a very close interest\nin career's work'. He was on the\ncareer's advisory board of Sussex\nUniversity for six years, on the\nUL CAS board for two and the\nRO GET advisory board for five.\nAs John Simpson had been\nworking with ICI for 32 years,\nFelix asked him why he had decided\nto leave. After a pause for thought\nhe replied - 'I'd always anticipated\nthat by my early fifties I'd want to\ndo something different. What I want\nto do is work in career's advice I am delighted to be\nhere, I 've been made to feel very\nwelcome, the environment is\npleasant and the job has proven to\nbe what I hoped it would'.\nHe told Felix that the present\nICC AS was 'very well set up and\norganised.... the information is first\nclass .... there is the right balance\nof experience amongst the staff.\nKen Wiltsher joined ICC AS with\nJohn Simpson.from ICI - he has\nbeen seconded on a full time basis\nuntil he finds another job. The team\nalso includes Frances McEwen, who has come from working at the\nPolytechnic of Central London CAS and who worked at ICC AS a couple\nof years ago, Tony Daly, the new\ninformation officer who joined\nICC AS in July, and Paula Cullens,\nthe information assistant who has\ncome from Keele University. The\ngraduate recruitment officer, Tracy\nCarter, provides continuity with the\nprevious team and Bill Fox, another\nsecond ee, works at ICC AS for two\ndays a week. John Simpson said that\nthere were no plans to expand the\nservice further though replacements\nfor Ken Wiltsher or Bill Fox will\nbe found when either leave.\nConcluding the interview, Mr Simpson said 'the job market in\n1991 has fewer vacancies and less\nrecruitment advertising. Job vacancies are down by 2 0 % and\n1992 will be equally difficult if not\nworse. My strong advice is to start\nlooking early - to use the Careers\nAdvisory Service If there is one\nmessage I want to get across that is\nto apply early. You might get a job\nas Imperial has a good reputation -but the popular jobs will be gone by\nEaster.'\n12\u2014\n\n"

    "content": "Feature Felix 910 30 September 1991\nHowever, thanks to student or\n'peer' tutoring, such problems have\nbeen partially relieved, in local\nschools, one day a week.\nThe idea is that an individual with\nknowledge or a skill can pass it on\nto others\u2014without necessarily being\na teacher. The scheme was invented\nin the late eighteenth century by\nJoseph Lancaster when faced with\n350 children to teach, single\nBack to Basics\nLast year nearly\n100 Imperial\nCollege students\nwent back to the\nclassroom.\nChris Riley\nreports on his\nsecond\nchildhood.\nJason was a tall, well built West\nIndian sixteen year old, with a left\nhook that would rival Mike Tyson and a hair cut to match. Five years\nago, with adolescent peer pressure\nto repel authority and education\nmounting, he had been labelled a 'disruptive and difficult pupil'.\nWith the end of school days now in\nsight, science classes just got in the\nway of his obsession with acid\nhouse music and basketball. Science\nwas something for other people,\nsomething he had never understood\nand therefore hated. Brownian\nmotion had never had any significance in his street life,\n' Imagine you are playing basketball, and lots of little guys are\nrunning round bumping into you, trying to get the ball', I began.\n'Okay man', he replied, beaming\ndown at me and then looking wildly\nround the class in a bid to distract\nothers.\n' Now these little guys are knocking you about'. I grabbed his\nblazer and shook him violently. He stared at me in disbelief.\n'Someone is watching this game\nfrom above, and can only see you moving about, because the little\nguys are too small to see.'\nJason peered down the\nmicroscope again as my experimental analogy hit its mark\nand the j it te ring smoke particles,\nabruptly changing direction took on\na previously undiscovered significance. It had taken the whole\nforty minute lesson to get this far,\nnot including the previous weeks of\nrejection, when I had failed to get\nthrough.\nThe buzzer rang, and he was off\nto the freedom of the street again.\nAs he left the classroom, he paused\nand came back. 'Fanks mate', he\ngrinned, slapping the palms of my hands. The weeks before, suddenly\nall seemed worthwhile and I returned the slap, with a 'see you next week m 'main man'. With growing pressure on teachers, such vital, individual\nattention, needed to convey many\nscientific ideas is, these days,\nbecoming more and more difficult\nto provide.\nhandedly at his Southwark school.\nRediscovered in the early 1960's to\nmeet teacher shortages in developing countries and inner\ncities in the US, it's supporters\nclaim there are significant benefits\nfor both tutors and pupils.\nIt was not until the mid-1970s that\nthe idea reached Britain. The scheme was launched by Dr Sinclair\nGoodlad as a course project for\ntwelve engineering students at\nImperial College, to test whether\npupils at Pimlico School would find\nlessons more interesting with their\nhelp. Today, results still show that\nwell over half (63 %) of pupils find\ntheir lessons easier to follow and\nnearly three quarters of teachers\nfind lessons more enjoyable and\neasier to handle. Almost all of the\nstudent tutors involved report an\nincrease in self confidence, feeling\nthat they have gained useful practice\nin communication skills, and are\ndoing something useful with their\nsubject. 'Explaining an idea to a nine year old offers a unique\nexperience of communicating, which can be invaluable to\nindustry', ex palin s John Hughes,\nformer peer tutor and now BP fellow in peer tutoring at Imperial.\nThe 'Pimlico Connection' was\nestablished by Goodlad in 1975 and\nfive years later it became a Union Society, administered and run\nlargely by students.\nResearch shows that school pupils\nfind peer tutors are more approachable when they don't understand things. ' A teacher can't get around the whole class\nsometimes but, with students there\nyou could get help more quickly',\nexplain Pimlico students, fifteen\nyears on.\nTerry Barclay, teacher at the Fox School in Holland Park, explains in\nthe Independent (26 July 1990) that\n'the children see the tutors as real\nscientists. They don't quite trust us\nas scientists somehow.' Peer tutors\nare often closer to the pupils age and\nstatus, than they are to teachers, and\ntherefore act as role models for\nchildren who, probably never\nconsider higher education. 'It is\nespecially good for girls to see\nwomen science students', points out\nJohn Mason of St. Clements and St.\nJohns School, in London. Beverly\nHirst, joint author of' Peer Tutoring', former peer tutor\nherself, and now a teacher, explains\nof the pupils; 'they found me most\nunusual\u2014a woman physicist. They\ncouldn't believe that I carried a \u201415\u2014\n\n"

    "content": "Letters Felix 910 30 September 1\n9\n9\n1\nUnsporting Heseltine\nand Hyde\nDear Editor\nRe: Imperial (College) Sports\nCentre.\nI believe we should all be\nconcerned about recent\ndevelopments at the Sports Centre,\nparticularly the imposition of 'admission' charges or compulsory\n'membership' for college staff and\nstudents (in addition to charges for\nuse of the facilities). Perhaps this\nis a case for a little investigative\nreporting on what appears to be an\ninsidious if not completely clandestine privatisation of the\nSports Centre and change of its\nprime use to that of a commercial\nhealth club.\nHere is the sequence of events so\nfar:\n1. Disappearance of the staff\nstudent Sports Centre Users Committee.\n2. Introduction of Membership\nfees for outsiders, retirement of the\ncollege manager.\n3. Award of a 'consulting\nmanagement' contract to\nWandsworth Council to provide a manager and improve the\nprofitability of the Centre.\n4. Increases in charges above\ninflation rates, and promotion of activities of special interest to\noutsiders (slimming clubs etc). New 'uniforms' for staff.\n5'. Introduction of admission\ncharges or 'membership' fees for\ncollege personnel and students (to\nenter our own facility!). This was\naccompanied by unilateral cancellation of staff Sports Centre\nMembership cards by the manager.\n(It was this action which provoked\nmy interest).\nYve's Dear Adam,\nI'd like to take an opportunity to\nsay a final farewell and thanks to\nImperial College and IC Union. Working for ICU has been a very\ninteresting and overall rewarding\nexperience. It was a challenge to set\nup and run the Welfare Advisory\nService and a task I could not have\nachieved without the help of IC staff\n(all), sabbaticals (most of) and\nmany college staff as well.\nSo thank you everyone for your\nsupport over the last 23\nA years and\nto all those who contributed to my generous leaving gift. This I intend\n6. Change of name from Imperial\nCollege Sports Centre to Imperial\nSports Centre.

We are\nassured that in spite of the imminent\nredundancy of361 dedicated parks\nstaff, horticultural standards and\nindeed all other standards will be\nraised.\nThis should not prove too difficult\nin the light of their rapid decline\nover the past ten years, the direct\nresult of Mr Heseltine's own cabinet's ongoing policy in this area\nof stringent financial cutbacks. The ensuring insidious cull of park staff\ninevitably resulted in total failure to\nmaintain any acceptable standard in\nthe Central London Parks, i.e. St\nJames, Regents, Hyde Parks and\nKensington Gardens.\nIn the same speech to the\nCommons the Minister promises 'a bright future' for our Royal Parks,\nyet fails to mention existing plans\nfor a coach park in Hyde Park. He fails also to give his reasons for\ndiscarding and disregarding the\nconclusions arrived at by Lord Skelmersdale in his review of the\nRoyal Parks in1987. LordS k elmer s dale concluded that\nnothing would be gained by their\nprivatisation.\nLondoners, justifiably sceptical,\nif not down right suspicious of the\nMinister's intentions and gravely\nconcerned about the future of these\nunique and very special open\nspaces, are currently taking to the\nstreets and petitioning fellow\nLondoners in a desperate bid, if not\nto stop the proposed legislation, at\nthe very least to demand their\ndemocratic right to a voice on this\nissue. The response regardless of political persuasion is unanimously\nagainst.\nAs custodians of the Royal Parks,\nhave we the right to leave a legacy\nof car and coach parks and money\nspinning follies to future\ngenerations? Your support would be\ninvaluable.\nJoin us, help us to protect our\nRoyal Parks.\nAnna Green.\n\u201417\n\n"

This possibility follows\nthe decision by Mr. Michael Heseltine, Secretary of State for the\nEnvironment, to privat is e the\nmaintenance of the eight Royal\nParks. Those against this move\nbelieve that it may be part of a larger strategy to put the control of\nall Royal Parks solely into the\nprivate sector. Amongst the\nprotestors are the Transport and\nGeneral Workers Union, to which\nthe parks' current employees\nbelong.\nOn Tuesday 17th September,\ncampaigners rallied in Holland Park\nat the opening of the Japanese\nGardens by Prince Charles. Police\npresence was heavy and complaints\nwere levied against police behaviour, saying that they had\nbeen 'bullying' anybody obviously\nconnected with park preservation.\nMeanwhile the campaign continues and the wheels of government continue to turn. Those\nwishing to take action should write\nto their MP, or the Prime Minister.\nPrince Charles at the opening of the new Japanese\nGardens, in Holland Park, now privately\nmaintained.\nVISIT\nTHE\nTANDO ORI RESTAURANT The home of authentic Indian cooking\n\u2014Fully Licensed\u2014\nNearest Tube, South Kensington\nOpen Monday-Sunday 12 noon to 3pm6 pm to 11.30pm in cl.

A company employee attempted to\nunblock the drain by pouring 93 %\nsulphuric acid down it. The gas\nreacted with a mystery material in\nthe drain and copious amounts of\nhydrogen sulphide filled the room.\nAccording to Ian Gillett, of the\ncollege safety unit, low levels of the\ngas are not dangerous but it\ndesensitizes the nervous system so\nthat when levels do become toxic\nthere is a danger that they are not\nnoticed. The gas is therefore\ndangerous, and since in this case it\noriginated from the drains system,\nthe entire building had to be\nimmediately evacuated. The building remained empty for eight\nhours until the gas levels subsided.\nNew Bookstore\nManager\nImperial College Union Bookstore\nhas a new manager.

Music will be issued from\nthe ground floor reception desk,\nwhile the Haldane entrance will be\npermanently closed.\nThere are plans to move the entire\nHaldane library stock to the ground\nfloor 'at some point during this\nacademic year', which will cause\ndisruption for a while. For the short\nterm, the Haldane music library will\nendeavour to keep to the present\nopening hours.\nStudents Charged\nfor Linen\nHome students will no longer be\nprovided with free linen when they\narrive at college residences.\nHousekeepers have been instructed\nby college accommodation management to offer linen packs for\nsale to students. The original policy\nincluded overseas students but it has\nbeen amended after student union\nintervention.\nThe linen packs contain two\nsheets, two pillow cases, a blanket\nand a bed cover. Most packs have\nbeen made up from the old linen,\ncommon to all halls of residence.\nAccording to Ms Gaskin, the\nGarden Hall housekeeper, students\nrarely used the blankets that were\nonce provided as many people\narrived with their own duvets.

In Peter\nGreenaway's visually stunning\nadaptation, 'Prospero's Books', we\nare shown the story from the idea\nthat 'The Tempest' was written by\nProspero and that its writing caused\nthe events to happen. Prospero,\nplayed by Sir John Gielgud, is\nabandoned on a barren island with\nhis baby daughter and some books\nfrom his library. Through the books\nhe obtains dominion over the\nisland's spirits and creates his own\nkingdom and eventually engineers\nthe fate of those who abandoned\nhim. Gie l gud brings the Shakespearean language to life so\nvibrantly that, at times, Greenaway's visual imagery seems\nunnecessary. Those who have seen\nhis earlier works, especially ' The Cook, the Thief, his Wife and her\nLover' will be familiar with his use\nof symbolism and colour, and here\nagain these are used to their utmost\neffect.

Thirty thousand\npiss heads believe it consists of a weekend orgy of alcohol and sex.\nIt's not, but Reading always was\nfull of contradictions such as, say\n'Carter' supported by 'the Fall'. Try a free festival and some brew\nand you'll be amazed. No more the\ndenizen of kids wearing Carter and\nNed' s tee-shirts. No more Goths\nand all for free.\nFriday was a good day.\nOminously grey clouds threatened\nand occasionally pissed down on the\npermanently pissed crowd, but the\nbill was excellent. Noise god after\nnoise god, never was a better lineup seen - except for the 'Honey\nThieves'. I 've never heard or seen\nthe Honey Thieves and do not want\nto talk about the bloody Honey\nThieves.\nNot so the 'Babes'. An ail-American, all-girl trio who play a bastard Rock n' Roll seldom\nbettered. They paled in the face of\nthe mighty, much maligned' Silverfish'. Their rhythmic, pulsating sound vibrates to your\nvery soul, truly, pop music to\nbrainwash to. Pure aural terror\nfaded as 'Nirvana' took over.\n'Dinosaur Jr'. Line up, and be\nbutt fucked by J's Guitar. Another\ndisappointment. Fuzzy sound and a shitty atmosphere ruined what could\nhave been. They still shred, cruising\nthrough monolithic (Tut tut, Seb.\nMixed metaphor) tracks like 'Freak\nScene' and ' The Wagon'. After greatness, 'Pop Will Eat\nItself. Again, need I say more. The\nonly band on friday worse than\nIggy, and that alone speaks\nnought but trouble. I would have\nstayed were Carter not so\nun mention ably dire. Alright I had\na headache as well.\nSunday.\nWith ony a few baggy stragglers\nleft over, drunken, dazed and too\nmuch out of their heads to be in yo' face, Reading turned into a kind of\nghost camp that Goth has always\nbeen: ridiculous and mildly third rate and little league. ' Ned' s' ha! The final nail in the coffin of the unfunny joke bands. And that's the funniest thing about them.\nExpect a resurgence in the next ten\nyears, but if I want humour, I 'll\nlisten to the 'Sisters'. Oh Christ,\nwhat a crap introduction...\nYes, yes I confess my reason for\nbuying the Reading ticket and yes,\nthe idea is incongruous. The purple\nlights, the pea soup of dry ice, and\nThe Reading Festival\nvolumes.\nThe band that should have\nheadlined. 'Sonic Youth'. Sonic\nTerrorism. From sex kitten Kim' s crusty panties to Lee's screaming\nguitar, Sonic Youth were awesome.\nAnd Iggy couldn't top it.\nPunk is dead and men like Iggy\nPop still try to animate it's rotten\ncorpse. It was an insult to anyone's sensibilities. Pause, and examine\nthe comparative merits of spending\nthe remaining hours watching Iggy\nstrut his funky shite, or getting\nhead fucked by a blazing fire.\nSaturday.\nConsider your concept of Saturdays. Are they comprised of\na headache, a field full of shit and\ncorpses, lots of people wearing tee-shirts screaming You Fat Bastard,\nand lots of, er, fat bastards? No? Oh I forgot shit music too. Except 'the\nFall'. If you didn't see this, you should be kicking yourself, or at\nMuch touted and perhaps over-rated, Nirvana were the darlings of\nthe Sub-pop scene.

'Carter\nUS M', or the CUS machine, as I prefer to call them, are not worth\nthe time of day. Contrary to popular\nopinion, I do not dislike 'James',\nbut the corruption of a good natured\npop band to major status speaks\nineffectual.\nThe 'Pooh-Sticks' were great.\nYeah, young people turn me on too.\nThe singer declares that we will\nnever see them again, before\nlaunching into 'I'm In You'. At this\npoint I leave the acoustic stage.\n'Gang Starr' are on the main stage.\nI walk away; what I don't need on\nSunday is the sort of lifeless wank\n' DeLa Soul' brought to Reading\nthe day before. Luckily I meet up\nwith some friends and we have a few beers. Jo Brand comes on in the\ncabaret tent. Jo Brand's funny. In\nthe acoustic tent, the 'Fatima\nMansions' are playing. They win -sorry Jo. So I wander to the tent for\n'Ceausescu', ' Viva Dead Ponies',\netcetera. They don't play ' Only Losers take the Bus', bloody\nshame, but Ceausescu is typically\nviolent. This man is very definitely\na main contender for the kingdom\nof rock and roll. Cathal Coughlan\nis a thrilling necessary commandment. His version of the\nmodern myth of society spat all\nover Reading and the 'Blow Chunk'\nattitudes of the other bands.\nSpeaking of which\nGodfathers are crap. They capture the quintessential ethos of\nall that's been shit this weekend -food, tee-shirts, flat beer, Saturday.\nThis is not sensitive or clever: it is\nthe throb of 'After Hours' that\nworked so well in Leeds earlier this\nyear translated to the massive open\nstage and the sceptical square mile\nof audience.\nEldritch wanders to his mike\nstand as the speed driven bars of\n'First and Last and Always' echo.\nHe' s wearing a tuxedo and bow tie.\nI spent the entire weekend getting\nshit faced to the point of inanity,\nand this was the first time I desired\nsobriety. Grungy black arse d Reading, gorgeously and ironically\nconfronted by a man in a tuxedo.\nTwo songs in, he greets the\naudience. It's 'Someday, everything\nyou need is just gonna fall from the\nskies'. ' Dominion' interrupts the\nconfused Goths train of thought and\nI laugh and pray for another nuclear\naccident. The bitch is, they close\ntoo early. His encore is for George\nBush' He' s got Tomahawk missiles in his hands, he's got the\nwhole fucking world in his hands'.\nAs the self-styled, self-emasculated\npale emperor bellows out his\nthanks, the darkness closes around\nthe cheerfully unhappy Goths and\nI wander back to the station, drunk\nand dirty, and considering what a generally wank y weekend it's been.\nYeah, I know festivals are crap.
