    "content": "11\nfelix\nFriday 11 May 2007\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSTALKER \u2013 Shadow of Chernobyl\nI\nt\u2019s a rare thing indeed to\nfind a first-person shooter\nwith a soul, which makes it\nall the more valuable when\nit does turn up. In recent\nyears, such games have been few\nand far between, with only HalfLife 2 really making the cut for me.\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. \u2013 Shadow of Chernobyl (Stalker from now on, sod the\n6 full stops) is a game with a soul,\nand one which oozes atmosphere.\nSet in Chernobyl, the site of a horrific real-world nuclear accident in\nthe 1980s, the game instantly has a\ndark and eerie air to it, and this is\nthe game\u2019s strongest selling point\nthroughout.\nThe game exudes authenticity \u2013\nNPC\u2019s converse in Russian, groups\nsit around campfires strumming\nguitars and humming quiet, mournful tunes and even when speaking\nto the player, all have a thick Russian accent. The Zone, the vast\narea around Chernobyl which has\nbeen taken over by various creatures unknown to the rest of the\nworld, is both lively and deserted at\nthe same time.\nRamshackle dwellings and com-munist-era concrete blocks house\na world that was abandoned hastily,\nbut still remains. Dolls, handbags\nand broken home appliances litter\nthe Zone, a constant reminder of a\nplace that was abandoned hastily.\nAnd yet, all this atmosphere surrounds a game that feels solid and\nwell-built in all the right places.\nGuns sound and feel right, explosions shake you, bullets hurt and\neven the most lowly enemy can kill\nyou if not dealt with correctly.\nThis is another aspect of Stalker\nthat draws you in \u2013 a constant feeling of vulnerability that permeates\nthe game. The story isn\u2019t the main\nreason to keep playing, the need to\nsurvive is. This is survival horror in\nits truest sense, a game where you\naren\u2019t being funneled through corridor after corridor, triggering a set\nof scripted events over which you\nhave no control.\nEnemies react well to your actions\nand fight their own battles even\nwithout your intervention, which\nmakes you feel mortal. You are not\nFreeman, you are not the divine\nhand of God \u2013 a fact that the developers highlight by putting Gordon\nin a cameo role. In fact, expect to\ndie a lot when you get flanked by an\nenemy you didn\u2019t know was there\nClick. Click. Click-click. Clickclickclickclickclickclick. Sebastian Nordgren heads into the zone\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R.\u2019s engine underwent several bouts of re-engineering, before reaching its final state. But it\u2019s the AI that brings the world to life.\nor walk around a corner into a blast\nof shotgun fire. It\u2019s a refreshing\nchange to play a game that is actually difficult, that doesn\u2019t hold you\nby the hand and doesn\u2019t apologize\nwhen it places you in a situation\nthat will get you killed over and over\nand over again until you get it. This\naspect is especially emphasized in\nstory-critical sections, which tend\nto be underground \u2013 where a careless move will result in your quick\nand violent death.\nHowever, Stalker isn\u2019t perfect\nand \u2013 even compensating for the\nelevated expectations that five\nyears of development and the most\nambitious ideas of the past decade\nbring \u2013 there are some definite dis-appointments. The RPG element of\nStalker is mostly left undeveloped\nand feels unfinished. While rummaging through the many stashes\nof equipment available sometimes\npays off, these rewards are usually\nvery temporary. Artifacts and suits\ncan be gained purely from doing the\nmain quest lines, and after you find\na good choice of artifacts there\u2019s no\nreason to change.\nThe lack of side quests was also\nirritating, despite the fact that\nvery, very few of these resulted in a\nmeaningful reward. Most result in a\ncash reward in a game with very little to buy. By the time you can buy a\nweapon from a trader, you\u2019ll already\nhave upgraded past it.\nBut for me the main disappointment ended up being small bugs\nand cut corners. The PDA is nice,\nbut the inability to have full control\nof your current mission was annoy-ing, and map markers just do not go\naway, ever. Main quest locations are\nstill marked on your map long after\nyou\u2019ve completed that objective.\nEnemies respawn quickly, making\nfor irritating and unnecessary firefights when just running through\nan area.\nThe biggest flaw, however, was\nthe division of the Zone into smaller\nareas. While it does divide the game\nup into levels, the developers still\napproach the game as a fully open-ended one in an undivided game\nspace.\nThis leads to a lot of time-consum-ing running back and forth through\nas many as four different areas for\none quest, with an extensive load\ntime between each of them. A quick-travel option would have been appreciated to fill the void that axing\nvehicles from the game left.\nStalker really is an amazing game\ndespite my complaints, but it feels\nunfinished and desolate (in the bad\nway) in some areas that rub the\nplayer the wrong way.\nMy conclusion, then, is that while\nStalker stands on its own rights as\none of the best shooters to come out\nin the past decade, Stalker 2 will be\nan earth-shattering experience.\nMerely filling in the blank areas of\nStalker and adding all those features that had to be removed will\ncreate a game that is massive, compelling and utterly captivating.\nBut as with all of these great gaming experiments, it needs the support of gamers. Is Stalker worth\nit? Yes. But more importantly, you\nshould buy Stalker so that GSC\nGameworld can go on to create that\nperfect sequel.\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R.\u2019s development team took a trek right into the heart of Chernobyl as part of the game\u2019s research. Some of the team are above, with the main reactor behind them.\n\n"

See, I\u2019m not glad we\u2019ve\ngot these things individually, but\nthe whole \u201cmodern\u201d package is\npretty appealing. Mainly because it\nstops me from scrabbling around\namongst ferns, foraging for food,\nwhile bludgeoning others to death\nwith pieces of flint.\u201d\nPAGES 10 & 11\nThis week\u2019s stories\nThe already dubious Internet connections supplied in the \u00a3130-aweek Unite halls across London\nwent down for almost an entire\nweek during crucial revision time\nfor some unlucky students at either\nOrient House or Piccadilly Court.\nAngry students could be heard\nscreaming with rage at the painfully slow connections and multiple\ntimeouts whilst trying to access\npast papers of lecture notes to revise for impending exams.\nThe fact that both halls are at\nleast 40 minutes travel away from\ncollege made it all the more frustrating for students who have few\nlectures this term (and therefore\nno reason to be in college), and who\ntake the sensible decision to revise\nin their rooms rather than the 30-de-gree library. They are encouraged\nby their departments to download\ncourse material from the Imperial\nCollege website for revision, as well\nas check emails at least twice a day\nin case of important information regarding tutorials, exams or revision\nclasses.\nConnectivity has now been restored in Unite halls according to\nu-want (the Unite ISP) technical\nsupport, but during the \u2018upgrade\u2019\nnumerous students have had their\nnetwork port blocked by the ISP\ndue to \u2018suspect virus infections\u2019\nwhich we can only assume they\nare using as one of the excuses as\nto why their \u201840x faster than dialup\u2019\ninternet connections were going\nslower than a 1980s modem.\nSome frustrated residents of the\nUnite halls claimed to be \u201closing\nthe plot and were considering destroying their PC\u2019s\u201d they were so\naggravated by u-want, although\nother students seemed to see the\nbrighter side claiming \u201cAt least I\u2019m\nnot wasting all my time looking on\nFacebook instead of working for my\nexams\u201d.\nIncidentally, connections in Unite\nhalls costs \u00a327 a month for a 2Mbit,\nport-restricted connection with a\nmaximum of 3 devices allowed per\nuser (Imperial students don\u2019t pay\nthis directly but it is unknown if\nthe \u00a3130 a week rent incorporates\nthe cost of internet). Compare this\nto Be-Broadband who offer 24Mbit,\nunrestricted access for \u00a324 a month,\nor even other Imperial College halls\nwho are directly connected to the\nICT network for free (~10Mbit). You\ndon\u2019t need a maths PhD to work out\nwho\u2019s getting ripped off.\nUNITE halls left\nwithout Internet\nAndy Sykes\nWhat little has been happening while you\u2019ve been revising\nFelix last week\nFirst up, an apology from us. Felix\ndidn\u2019t go out last week, for a number\nof reasons, including an editor on\nleave for personal reasons, and a\nserious shortage of staff (due to\nexams and other reasons). We\u2019re\nsorry; it won\u2019t happen again.\nWho will be the next rector?\nSir Richard Sykes, the current rector of the College, will be departing\nat the end of next year. However, his\nreplacement is due to be announced\nin July, and rumours abound about\nwho will replace Sir Richard as\nhead of the ninth-best university in\nthe world.\nInitial rumours that had been\ncirculated to Felix suggested that\nLord Browne, the now departed\nchief executive officer of BP\n, might\nbe offered the post. However, you\ncannot fail to have noticed Lord\nBrowne recently suffered a horrendous fall from grace; an injuction\nwas denied on printing details about\nhis private life, which revealed that\nhe had been involved in a four-year\nhomosexual relationship with a Canadian, Jeff Chevalier, and had lied\nto a judge about how he had met Mr\nChevalier.\nLord Browne has also accepted\n\u201cmoral responsibility\u201d (avoiding\nany notion of legal responsibility)\nfor an explosion at a Texas oil refinery which killed 15 people and injured 180 more. The Mail on Sunday\nrevealed that the company, under\nBrowne\u2019s directions, had placed an\n\u2018accounting value\u2019 of \u00a310m on an\nemployee\u2019s life.\nSo, if not Browne, then who? Felix\nhears that the College management\nwould prefer someone with more of\nan academic background than Sir\nRichard, who spent most of his life\nworking for GlaxoSmithKline as a\nbusinessman. In fact, Sir Richard\u2019s\nstyle was initially criticised as \u201ctoo\nbusiness-like\u201d, with the rebranding of 2003-4 perceived as him attempting to mould the College into\na business.\nThe name that Felix has heard Do u want it? Tough, it doesn\u2019t work very well\nmentioned is Professor Sir David\nKing, the current Chief Scientific\nAdvisor to the government. King\nis an outspoken supporter of the\nIPCC\u2019s findings on global warming,\nand has called climate change \u201cone\nof the greatest challenges facing\nthe UK today\u201d.\nA working group was formed by\nthe Union to be a forum for discussing what kind of rector the students\nwould like next, but this has come\nto naught. It is unlikely that the College will take any notice of student\ndemands on this front, and that instead the process of selecting the\nnext rector will remain completely\nopaque.\nSouthside delays\nFelix has learnt that full opening\nof Southside is likely to be delayed\nuntil the end of October, which may\ncause problems for the hordes of\nincoming freshers. The College is\nrelying on Southside to be complete\nin time for the start of the year, as it\nis currently suffering from a dearth\nof available accomodation.\nFelix reported last term on how\nthe twin rooms in the building are\ntoo small for habitation by two stu-dents, but it now seems that they\nwill be used as doubles (despite being the size of some single rooms in\nother halls).\nIn related news, plans to redevelop Eastside (Linstead Hall) in\na similar fashion to Southside, using the same prefabricating tech-niques, may be put on hold as the\ncost of the project has become\nprohibitive.\nImperial 3rd in Guardian ranking\nImperial has been placed overall\nthird in the Guardian\u2019s ranking of\nUK universities, despite surveys\nshowing the College suffers from\npoor student satisfaction ratings.\nThe Guardian rankings include\ndata from the National Student\nSurvey; Imperial was rated the lowest out of the top 35 institutions.\nReasons cited include poor teaching and extremely high workloads.\nSouthside construction delayed?\n2 felix Friday 11 May 2007\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMetropolitan Police surround South Kensington station after a fight\nbetween two men led to a stabbing\nCENTRE PAGES\n\n"

    "content": "Werner Herzog: An Old New Wave\nStefan Carpanu explores the beauty of cinema past by contemplating German maverick, Werner Herzog\nAs German cinema has been creeping into the limelight in the last few\nyears (the Oscar win of The Lives of\nOthers \u2013 even if controversial \u2013 being the just reward for their recent\n\u201cexports\u201d) I turn to look at one of\nthe major German directors of the\n20th century.\nWerner Herzog, born in Munich\non the 5th of September 1942, is\nperhaps one of the most unusual\nfilm directors \u2013 and people \u2013 you\ncan come across. His story is so\nbizarre, that you might well think\nit the result of a very imaginative\nmind: born in a mountainous area\nin Bavaria, avid of hiking since the\nage of 14, he did not come into contact with technology until he was 17\n\u2013 when he first used a telephone. He\nworked part-time as a steel welder\nduring high-school and made his\nfirst film at the age of 19.\nThese experiences shaped his\nmovies to a large extent, as Herzog\nwent on to shoot some of the most\nvivid and haunting imagery ever to\nbe seen on film. He is credited as\npart of the \u201cNew German Wave\u201d\nin cinema, which existed between\n1960 and 1980, and included the\nlikes of Rainer Werner Fassbinder\nand Wim Wenders.\nSo how does Herzog\u2019s work and\nhis conception of art stand up to the\n\u201crigours\u201d of the 21st century? Well, I\nreckon the word \u201cboring\u201d may come\nto mind at one point or another. But\nthat is only because many people\nare not used to the poetic dualism\nof his films. For instance, his remake of Nosferatu is more an analytical look at the hideous condition\nof the lycanthrope, him bearing the\nloneliness of eternity, the qualms of\naddiction, the perpetual isolation,\nStefan Carpanu rather than being a blood thirsty, vicious creature. Chances are, you\u2019ll\nend up feeling bad for the guy.\nHerzog\u2019s acclaimed masterpieces Aguirre: The Wrath of God\nand Fitzcarraldo are a joy to gaze\nat, sublimely shot in the Peruvian\nrainforest. This made them not\nonly beautiful to look at, but also\nimmensely difficult to conceive.\nFilming in the jungle, alongside a\nmadly eccentric (but also exqui-site) performer like Klaus Kinski,\nin such a remote area of the world\nwas a challenge often greater than\nthe film itself.\nIt is amazing how the stories\nbehind the making of his movies\nturn into a work of art of their own.\nThere is a special vibration to it all,\nthoroughly caught on film in the\ndocumentary about the \u201clove-hate\u201d\nrelationship between Herzog and\nKinski \u2013 My Best Fiend. Herzog\u2019s\ntake on documentaries is also ab-sorbingly original, as they often\ntranscend the factual realm and\ndazzle, with the essence of life and\nart shining through. Perhaps one\nof the best documentary films ever\nmade, Grizzly Man, the sad story\nof two activists who lived amongst\ngrizzly bears, takes on a depth so\nunexpected that its beauty can but\nleave a deep impression.\nThis year, his first major fictional\nfilm in years is supposed to pre-miere, if it manages to disentangle itself from financial difficulties.\nRescue Dawn stars Christian Bale\nand looks at the story of a pilot shot\ndown in Vietnam (what imagery I\nsense already!) who goes through\nan immense ordeal in his fight for\nsurvival.\nFilm is beautiful, they used to say.\nWatching Herzog\u2019s works will tell\nyou why.\nImperial College\nInformation and Communication\nTechnologies Division (ICT)\nSummer Student Projects\n\u00a311.30 per hour\nICT has a number of opportunities available for\nstudents over the summer vacation period. The\nsuccessful applicants will be working on projects in\nthe following areas:\n- IT Security and Disaster Recovery\n- Microsoft Sharepoint\n- Wireless Networking\n- ICT Faculty Support\nThese positions would ideally suit undergraduate students with relevant\nIT skills, who would like to gain practical IT experience in a challenging\nenvironment.

    "content": "Cricketeers thrash City\u2019s brightest\nHaving enjoyed our time abroad, it\nwas time for the competitive season to begin, but unlike last year\nour promotion in the BUSA league\nmeant tougher opposition. First\nBUSA game, City 1st XI.\nWe were off to a quick start courtesy of our yellow Imperial College\nUnion minibus, fully kitted out with\na tape player and wireless. Anura\nMalaweera (Honey Monster)\nquickly ceased upon the opportunity to play a Pop Mix of Cyndi\nLauper\u2019s \u201cGirls Just Wanna Have\nFun\u201d. Anura was promptly moved\nto the back seat.\nSoon enough we arrived at what\nappeared to be City\u2019s home ground\ni.e. an uncut wicket, no boundaries\nor pitch markings. In fact, it was a\nfield.\nUnfortunately we couldn\u2019t bring\nour lawnmower to the game, but\nCity were adamant that they could\nget it ready in time (of course they\ncouldn\u2019t). We attempted to sneak-ily fit our 50 over game on an adjacent ground unnoticed. Unluckily\nfor us, the 2 other teams who had\nhired out the ground were on the\nball. They shrewdly noticed the extra 22 players warming up on their\nground. Sure enough a forfeit was\nin order. However whilst signing\nthe relevant documentation, the\nCity captain got a call from one\nof his clan; another ground was\navailable.\nCutting a long story short (no pun\nintended), we elected to field first\nin a reduced 35 over per side game.\nZirgham \u201cZippy\u201d Afridi bowled an\nincredible reverse swinging dead\nstraight low beamer which took the\nCity opener with the 1st ball of the\ninnings. Perfect start; that is until\nCity\u2019s lower order (2 and 3) came\nto the party.\nAlmaher \u201cI have no nickname\u201d\nShelley and Zippy kept them quiet for a while, but they soon got\nstuck into the rest of the bowling.\nThat is until Gibbon (Luke Gibson)\nstepped up to take their opener\nwith the first ball.\nCity, not content to have 2 batsman on the pitch at any one time,\ndecided to call out a 3rd person to\nrun for their unfit number 3, needless to say the confusion of having\nan extra batsman was too great for\nthe City boys. He was promptly run\nout by the length of the pitch.\nPranav \u201cBaby Face\u201d Ullal and\nGibbon continued to bowl with\ngreat distinction. City batsmen\nwere dropping like flies, finishing with a score of 209 off their\n35 overs; a score which deserved\n\u201cbare\u201d respect.\nThe pitch was terrible, you could\nbowl a bouncer or a pea-roller if you\npitched the ball on a good length.\nBoth Kyle \u201cSanta\u201d Santos and \u201cI\nhave no nickname\u201d succumbed to\nthe latter.\nMeanwhile Thilina \u201cThe Machine\u201d Ambepitiya continued to\nsmash the ball to all parts. Abeetha\n\u201cPingpong\u201d Perrera offered some\nsupport, before he attempted to\npull a yorker.\nVaibhav Weeman Kumar ran to\nthe crease, eagerly anticipating\nhis first ball of the season.\nThe very next ball Leon \u201cAbdul\u201d\nLoveridge came in and consequently built a partnership with\nThe Machine; that is until Thil\nsupposedly middled the ball to the\nkeeper, ending his greatest inning\nin 4 seasons for IC (though he did\nhave the consolation of a half cen-tury). Honey Monster thought the\nThilina Ambepitiya\npage 15\nCROSSWORD\nWORDOKU\nport\nS\nImperial 1st XI vs\nCity University 1st XI\nImperial: 210-9 (Loveridge\n52*, Ambepitiya 50) bt City\nUniversity 209-9 (Ullal 30-4,\nGibson 31-3) by 1 wicket\nbest way to cheer the captain up\nwould be to race Leon to one end of\nthe pitch. This did not work. Anura\nwas run out by 2/3 of the pitch. Well\ndone Anura.\nBut as batsmen continued to be\ntriggered, the real star of the show\ncame to the fore. It was nail biting\naction as it came down to our last\npair. Loveridge showed his true\nclass crunching a 4 to shepherd IC\nhome to a 1 wicket victory. Pitch\ninvasion.... what a legend.\nThis was the best run chase in IC\nhistory, 6 an over on a poor wicket\nagainst brass opposition was no\nmean feat. This team showed a\ntrue \u2018never say die\u2019 mindset. At no\npoint did they give up, at no point\ndid they doubt themselves; they\nwere strong, stronger than any\nother previous IC team. This was\nthe Machine\u2019s Machine. There\u2019s a\nlot more to come from these boys.\n\u201cThe Machine\u201d pauses on his way to a half-century for a brief staring match with the ball\nEscalators\n(the last time I tried this, I got hit by a slinky going down at double speed)\nCD Tray Fight\n(this is silly, of course; the real\nenemy will be born in the network)\nxkcd www.xkcd.com\n\n"

In fair-ness, it\u2019s not STALKER that\u2019s made me\nthink about it this\nweek \u2013 more that Felix\u2019s press day is the last day of\nmy exams for the year. The last\nday. Time off. The end.\nBut it\u2019s a bit scary, you see.\nBecause it\u2019s the end \u2013 no direc-tion. No cramming. No deadlines to meet, no direction. Of\ncourse, I can do anything I want\nnow \u2013 free to imbibe, inhale or\nwhatever else people do when\nthey have nothing else to. But\nI don\u2019t want to, because there\u2019s\nnothing to suggest it\u2019s worth it.\nFreedom can be a bit too free\nsometimes. A bit too restricting in how open it is. Paradoxical though it might seem, since\nfreedom is all we strive for, and\nit\u2019s sure as hell is what I\u2019ve\nwanted since revision started,\nbut within a week I\u2019ll be unsure\nof what I\u2019m doing. And then\nwhat?\nI\u2019ve not played STALKER\nyet, but I\u2019ve heard plenty of stories of people just playing with\nthe world \u2013 setting up fights\nbetween groups just to see how\nthe AI handles it, and the kind\nof free-spirited experimentation that reminds me of the first\ntime I played Deus Ex. They\u2019ve\nmade friends and enemies, had\nemotions evoked in them, and\nfeel like they wove a story.\nSince last week, where we\ncovered some of the top Indie\ngames, I\u2019ve played both Facade\n\u2013 which we did cover \u2013 and\nMasq \u2013 which we didn\u2019t. Two\ngames that use complete freedom as a way to engineer a new\nkind of challenge. Masq offers\nfour choices at each stage, and\nhas a wide variety of different\nendings. Facade offers an infinite choice at each stage, but\nonly about three endings.\nWhich one is more satisfying?\nFor me, it\u2019s Facade \u2013 the ability\nto feel my choices are unique,\neven if I see the same ending\nquite often. In life, we make\nchoices uniquely, but only see\nan ending once. Being restricted in our immediate choices is\nless immersive than being restricted in our end result.\nAnd yet games like STALKER don\u2019t entirely fulfil me.\nI\u2019m more likely to fire up Max\nPayne or Halo and play a story\nthrough to the finish \u2013 linear\nas hell, but at least I\u2019ve got di-rection, at least I\u2019m experiencing what the designers knew I\nwould.\nMaybe I\u2019m predictable, or\nmaybe I just know what I like.\nEither way, I think I need a\nsummer job.\nMichael Cook\nGames Editor\n10 felix Friday 11 May 2007\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis Week In Videogaming\nI\ntell you what \u2013 I\u2019m kind of glad\nwe have digital watches. And\nnot just digital watches, but\nAnnie Lennox too. And processed cheese. See, I\u2019m not\nglad we\u2019ve got these things individ-ually, but the whole \u201cmodern\u201d package is pretty appearling. Mainly because it stops me from scrabbling\naround amongst ferns, foraging for\nfood, while bludgeoning others to\ndeath with pieces of flint.\nCapitalism \u2013 for all its flaws \u2013 does\nhave the saving grace of giving us\nsomething to do.\nNaturally, way back when, we had\nnothing. It was a case of eat, or be\neaten; avoid missing ball for high\nscore; collect the dots and avoid\nthe ghosts. But as civilisation de-veloped, we moved on. WE had scientific compounds to escape from,\ngangs to run missions for, princesses to save. We had reached a design\npinnacle. We were enlightened.\nLately, though, gaming in particular has suffered something of a fall.\nWe\u2019ve got out priorities wrong, you\nsee. Games like Grand Theft Auto\ngave us a sense of freedom, and\nwe thought we\u2019d like some more.\nSo they tore a few walls down here\nor there. Endings multiplies, and\nthen disappeared completely. Protagonists became duplicated, and\nthen entirely customisable. Diablo\u2019s dungeon searching gave way to\naimless wandering around Tamriel.\nLeagues and ladders were replaced\nby endless, meaningless death-matches \u2013 and always on bloody\nZanzibar.\nIt\u2019s the old days again, the bad\ndays. We\u2019ve come full circle, and\nto put it lightly it\u2019s a bit of an\nanticlimax.\nIt was the fault of multiplayer,\nin part. Playing against humans\nis visceral, and very immediate.\nIt was natural to want more, but\nthe more player vs. player you put\ninto a game, the less organised it\nbecomes.\nWhen it\u2019s done well, freedom is\njust as liberating as the name im-pliex. Take EVE Online, for exam-ple, the seminal sci-fi MMO where\nthe game is so open-ended that\nthere\u2019s virtually nothing in the\nhuge expanse of space that isn\u2019t\ncaused or created by the players\nthemselves.\nThere\u2019s no bleak, directionless\ngaming here, though \u2013 here, there\nare inter-corporation wars, hugh\npolitical debates, and betrayal on\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. wants to set you free. But isn\u2019t it much cosier in these chains?\nHalf-Life 2\u2019s single-player was horribly linear - but it was supposed to be. Beckett would be proud.\nan unimaginable scale. Scandals\nsuch as the blueprint-smuggling\nEVE employee, or the in-game\ncoup that cost a real-world equivalent of $16,500 damage, are headline stories for gaming sites and\npublications.\nBut EVE is a special case, and\nthese glamourous events are not\neveryday. Sign up for a trial, and\nyou\u2019ll more than likely find that\nfreedom in EVE\u2019s deep space is\nvery realistic indeed \u2013 empty, and\ndevoid of much point.\nWhere have the real gaming\nlandmarks come from in the last\nfew years? Not through the unique\nmoments stumbled across in a\nnon-linear wasteland. It was those\nshared moments, those holy-shit-Master-Chief-is-riding-a-friggingbomb moments. It was when Aeris\ndied (OMG spoilers, indeed). It was\nwhen you first held the gravity gun,\nwhen Link first hopped onto Epona,\nor the first home run you hit in Wii\nSports.\nIt\u2019s why we remember the Doom\nMarine, and not the Pong paddle,\nwhy we cherish the Nova Prospekt\noutskirts more than Q2DM6, and\nwhy we tell people about holding\nYorda\u2019s hand with more emotion\nthan we tell them about holding a\nshotgun in FEAR Combat.\nLife isn\u2019t about what we uniquely\nexperience \u2013 it\u2019s about what we\nshare with others. IT\u2019s the con\u201cAnd That Bit When...\u201d The Top Moments You Didn\u2019t Miss\nMGS \u2013 Metal Gear Rex\nYou\u2019d killed supernatural snipers,\npowerful psychics and a tank, but\nnothing quite matched the first\nmoment the missile-firing, metal-scraping bitchmother itself kicked\ninto life, and you suddenly realised\nyou\u2019d need a bigger pistol.\nMedal of Honor \u2013 Omaha Beach\nIt wasn\u2019t just a great gaming mo-ment, it was the first of a new\ngeneration. People died, and your\ngun couldn\u2019t do a damn thing. You\ncouldn\u2019t do a damn thing, except\nnot get killed yourself. A genre-de-fining moment.\nWind Waker \u2013 The High Seas\nThe sheer vastness of the ocean in\nWind Waker was enough to make\nthe garish visuals and new controls\nall better. The beauty, the crispness,\nthe simplicity. It was Zelda, but with\na special kind of polish, that promised a great game.\nHalo \u2013 The Maw, Pt. III\nYou\u2019re belting through the guts of a\n2km-long bomb, and the world is fittingly going to hell. An epic soundtrack is bursting above the roar of\nthe warthog, and time is running\nout. Frustrating, overlong, but unbelievably awe-inspiring.\nnection we make through things\nwe all went through. It\u2019s like being\nin \u2018Nam, but less impressive. And\nmore controversial.\nFortunately, linearity isn\u2019t dead\nyet. Half-Life 2\u2019s episodes continue\nto entertain, LucasArts are pushing\ninto new realms of epic storytelling,\nand designers like Miyamoto, Kojima and Mikami still firmly believe\nin the power of the narrative.\nBut linearity is a dirty word now,\nassociate with oppression, unfairness and plain bad design. Openended games like Spore are poised\nto hit linearity right out of the park.\nAnd then all we\u2019ll have left will be\nmemories of processed cheese, and\na battered copy of Deus Ex.\n\n"

Is it\nthe President? The Sabbatical team? The\nExecutive Committee? The Union Council? Or\nis it even the College itself?\nThere is a saying in legal circles that if you ask\ntwo lawyers a question then you\u02bcll get three\nanswers. After months of squabbling with\nthe College\u02bcs barristers and solicitors over\nthe legal status of ICU and the implications of\nthe recently introduced Charities Act on our\nUnion, we have come to the view that this old\nadage is entirely correct.\nWhat\u2019s wrong with ICU\u2019s\ngovernance?\nUnlike most students\u02bc unions in the country,\nICU is technically a legal part of Imperial\nCollege, although this matter has been\ndebated for nearly a decade. This unusual\nlegal arrangement has never really been a\nproblem because the Union Constitution and\nunwritten etiquette has meant that the College\nhas largely kept its nose out of our a\ufb00airs.\nThey are mandated by the Education Act to\nkeep an eye on our \ufb01nances and elections,\nbut the same act restricts their right to barge\nin and \ufb01re the whole Sabbatical Team without\na decent reason.\nThis year a new bill of parliament that governs\nhow charities are run will become an Act. This\nact, known simply as the \u201cCharities Act 2006\u201d,\nwill call for large students\u02bc unions to register\nindependently as separate charities from their\nparent institutions. After much discussion\nit has been agreed that ICU, in spite of its\nunusual legal position, should register as a\nseparate charity and this is exactly what we\nintend to do.\nPutting trust inTrustees\nHowever, charities are, as de\ufb01ned by this\nAct, usually governed by identi\ufb01able, small,\nhighly skilled Boards of Trustees. Currently\nICU has no Trustee Board of any kind, except\nperhaps (depending on which lawyer you ask)\nthe Imperial College Council, which has just\none student member. This is a situation that,\nin the words of our legal expert, \u201cis a highly\nunsatisfactory state of a\ufb00airs\u201d.\nWe want to use this opportunity to strengthen\nthe democratic pillars of our organisation\nwhilst ensuring that the nitty-gritty tasks\nof running a complex charity are e\ufb00ectively\nexecuted. We want to allow for students to\nlead our Union but be supported by experts\nfrom diverse backgrounds and \ufb01elds of\nexpertise. Most importantly of all, we want\nour Union to retain its autonomy from the\nauspices of the College so that our members,\nImperial\u02bcs students, can set out a vision for the\nfuture of our organisation. Finding a model\nthat strikes a balance between democracy\nand pragmatism and romantic notions of\nindependence and realism has not been easy,\nwhich is why it has taken us nearly a year to\ncomplete a complex governance review that\nhas touched almost every part of the central\nfunctions of ICU. However, we now have a\nproposal that has been warmly received by\nevery committee and focus group that has\nseen it so far.\nThe big idea\nWe are proposing that the Union establishes\nan identi\ufb01able, apolitical, highly skilled,\nrelatively small Board of Trustees to act as the\nultimate governing body of ICU. Underneath\nthis body we suggest that the powers of the\nUnion Executive to pass new Union Policy\nbe transferred to the Union Council, thus\nstrengtheningourmostdemocraticcommittee\nand clarifying its role as the paramount\npolicy making body in the Union. It is further\nrecommended that the Union Court\u02bcs role as\nan independent and apolitical judicial body\nshould remain and be strengthened. This\ncreates a tripartite governance structure with\na sovereign \u201cPrivy Council\u201d body at the very\ntop.\nThe Trustee\nBoard would\nbe unlike any\nother Union\ncommittee and\nbe tasked to\ndo all of the\nboring but\nhighly necessary\ng o v e r n a n c e\ntasks that no\nother Union\ncommittee currently undertakes. This\nBoard would meet six times a year and\nwould consider \ufb01nancial strategy, long term\nplanning, risk, human resources issues and\nanything functional that requires a vision\nthat extends beyond the 12 months that a\nPresident remains in o\ufb03ce for.\nWhat do you think?\nLast week the Union Council discussed these\nproposals in detail and the intention is that\nthey will be formally considered at the next\nCouncil meeting that will be held on May\n21st. If everything goes well, we could see\nthe \ufb01rst meeting of this body next term and\nnotable improvements in the way the Union\nis governed over the forthcoming year.\nWe welcome and indeed strongly encourage\nstudents to let us know what they think about\nthese proposals. Granted, governance is not\nthe most exciting topic we have dealt with this\nyear, but it is important that we get this right.\nIf you want to express a view on this debate\nthen you can, attend Union Council at 18:30\non May 21st in the Union Dining Hall, Beit\nBuilding, South Kensington, write to your\nrepresentative on the Union Council \u2013 a list of\nrepresentatives can be on our website or write\nto the Union President, John Collins.\nT\nrustee Board Consultation Launched\nJohn Collins\nPresident\npresident@imperial.ac.uk\nNominate your Friends for a UnionAward Pedaling for Imperial Students\nOur very own President John Collins has\ndecided to stop aksing for everyone else to\nraise money for the Centenary and instead\nraise some himself!\nJohn will be cycling from Land\u02bcs End to John\nO\u02bcGroats the week after the Centenary Ball.\nAll money raised from this epic journey will\ngo towards the Beit Masterplan.\nWhatweneedfromyouisyoursponsorship!\nThe Beit Masterplan is a project to renew\nthe Union Building and the \ufb01rst stage of\nthisprojectisalmost\ufb01nished,withournew\ncentral core sporting a new lift.

    "content": "Channel 4\u2019s recent broadcast of\nMartin Durkin\u2019s \u201cThe Great Global\nWarming Swindle\u201d demonstrated\nadmirably that the media has little\nissue with generating controversy\npurely to serve its own purposes,\neven if those responsible for the\ncontent have a history of complaints\nupheld against them by the Independent Television Commission.\nSo what? Does it matter if, for ex-ample, a producer knowingly misrepresents those who are asked to\ncontribute to his programme in order to stir up discord? Is it wrong to\nreport what many would consider to\nbepropagandaknowingthatthema-jority of those for whom you claim to\nspeak would take a different view?\nSome might argue not. However,\nthe extent to which the debate over\nglobal warming is being used as a\nplatform for polarizing public opinion represents a dangerously cynical move by much of today\u2019s press\n\u2013 a move which is not without its\nconsequences.\nAt the heart of the issue lies science\u2019s fragile relationship with the\npublic. On the one hand, science is\nseen as a risky, costly, incomprehensible pursuit; out of touch with\ndaily life and out of reach to anyone\nbut those already admitted to its\ncommunity. On the other, science\nis humanity\u2019s best effort yet to truly\nunderstand the world in which we\nlive; its benefits to society as diverse as the questions it seeks to\nanswer and its processes transpar-ent. Yet the very existence of these\ntwo opposite views of science is as\nmuch of a product of the media as\nare any of the scientific controversies reported on the TV and in the\nnewspapers.\nSince the 1960s, when the liberal\nmovement brought about a loss of\nfaith in traditional figures of political and institutional authority, scientists have had an increasing role\nScience, conscience & controversy\nWho\u2019s swindling who when it comes to the debate over global warming?\nas a class of professional experts\nable to mediate on social relations.\nPolicy makers have subsequently\nresorted to delegating an escalating\nnumber of problems to those scientists considered able to give their\n\u2018professional\u2019 and \u2018expert\u2019 opinions.\nWhile there is much to be said for\nthe resultant rise in the public\nawareness of science, the way in\nwhich this is handled in today\u2019s media culture can be at best, damaging\nand at worst, deceitful.\nJournalistic attempts to be objective often make use of balance by\nallowing a variety of opposing views\nto be heard. Although this undoubtedly increases the news interest of\na piece, it often has the effect of reducing the subject at hand to something similar to party politics. For\npolitics itself, this is not necessarily\na good thing. In the case of science,\nhowever, it runs the risk of trivialis-ing the amount of specialist knowledge that is required to pass valid\nscientific judgement on the issue\nAdam Kaye\nbeing discussed. What is worse, a\nlimited use of balance runs the risk\nof seriously endangering the objectivity of the piece.\nThere is no doubt that much of\nthe latest scientific research is\nhotly contested and that significant\ndebate does occur, both publicly and\nprivately, between scientists with\nopposing viewpoints. In the case of\nglobal warming, a host of theories\nexist whose validity is challenged\nby many within the scientific mainstream (for instance the effect of\ncosmic rays [see opposite page], the\nshutting-down of the Gulf Stream,\nand positive \u2018carbon cycle feedback\u2019\nloops where carbon dioxide is released from warming permafrost,\nsea beds and/or soil). Additionally,\nit is practically impossible to dissociate the political and scientific\nissues that make up the ongoing\ndebate over the effects of climate\nchange. Despite this, there are certain basic understandings, made\nclear in the International Panel on\nClimate Change\u2019s recent \u201cSummary for Policymakers\u201d, whose validity\nis supported by the overwhelming\nmajority of the international scientific community. The facts of the\nreport are stated each with their\nown degrees of uncertainty \u2013 an uncertainty based on the quantitative\nevaluation of the margins of error\ninvolved in the measurements and\ncalculations used, not an uncertainty based on the subjective views\nof those who produced the report.\nThis key difference is crucial to understanding how the scientific and\nmedia worlds differ in their representations of reality.\nWhat can be said, then, of those\nwho exploit any scientific uncertainty surrounding global warming\nsolely for the purposes of generating controversy in the public do-main? In the case of Martin Durkin\u2019s documentary for Channel 4,\none contributor, Carl Wunsch, wrote\nthat the misuse of his remarks in\nthe programme was \u2018close to fraud\u2019,\nthat his \u2018professional reputation\nwas damaged\u2019 and that he had been\n\u2018duped\u2019 into agreeing to be filmed\nunder the terms by which he had\ninitially been approached. Professor Jo Haigh of Imperial College\n[interviewed overleaf] was one of\nseveral of the UK\u2019s leading climate\nscientists who made their opinion of\nthe programme clear in a letter to\nthe Observer. \u201cWe defend the right\nof people to be sceptical, but for C4\nto imply that the thousands of scientists and published peer-reviewed\npapers, summarised in the recent\ninternational science assessment,\nare misguided or lying lacks scientific credibility and simply beggars\nbelief.\u201d\nIn allowing the debate over climate change to continue on the\nlevel aired by \u201cThe Great Global\nWarming Swindle\u201d, Martin Durkin,\nwhether deliberately or not, plays\ndirectly into the hands of an industry who stands to gain by distracting the public from one key issue.\nThis issue is that the economic and\nindustrial framework of the world\ntoday is built around our ability to\nextract and use fossil fuels. Said in-dustry, and society as a whole, must\nbe made to account for the ever-in-creasing extraction of these fossil\nfuels, the amount of pollution generated by their consumption, the\nlikely effects of this pollution, and\nthe reasons behind planned financial investment in infrastructure\nbuilt solely for the purpose of further fossil fuel extraction. We need\nto be able to recognise those parties\nwhose interests are promoted by\nthe voices who continuously shout\ncontroversy in the face of climate\nchange and move the debate to their\ndoorstep. Above all though, we need\nto maintain a clear understanding\nof who is being swindled and who is\ndoing the swindling. Our ability to\nlook back on the 21st century with a\nclear conscience will depend on it.\nThe physiological and psychological impact of vehicle design was\none of many thought-relating talks\nat Imperial\u2019s recent Neuroscience\nresearch day \u2013 Felix went along to\nfind out more.\nSpatial orientation is a very basic biological requirement, according to Professor Michael Gresty, of\nthe Division of Neuroscience and\nMental Health. Even the most basic\nlifeforms need to be able to orient\nthemselves with respect to their en-vironment, so they can respond to,\nsay, a chemical gradient. It\u2019s even\nmore important for higher organ-isms, like humans, which operate\nin a more complex environment.\nAs a result of being such a fundamental priority, Gresty said maintaining one\u2019s orientation can often\ntake precedence over other cognitive processes. This can be fatal in\ncertain situations \u2013 apparently 12%\nof aircraft crashes (rising to 30%\nfor military helicopters) can be attributed to pilot disorientation, despite them nominally being trained\nto cope with this. Gresty and his\ncollaborators set out to investigate\nhow spatial and verbal tasks were\naffected by disorientation, strapping test subjects into a pivoting\nchair, with a screen displaying an\napparent view of the outside world.\nThey found that when the screen\nshowed a world which pivoted with\nthe right frequency, but in the wrong\ndirection (the floor came into view\nwhen the chair tilted backwards),\nsubjects\u2019 spatial test results were\nvery poor. But this was an insidious\neffect, as even professional pilots\nweren\u2019t aware what they were seeing was absurd (virtually none of\nthe audience members, watching a\nvideo of the tests, noticed this either,\nuntil it was pointed out). Hence they\ncouldn\u2019t quarantine the poorer test\nresults stemming from disorienting motion by, for example, placing\nless trust in those results, as they\nweren\u2019t aware the motion was significantly different from non-disori-enting motion.\nProfessor Gresty then passed on\nto motion sickness, which apparently affects about a third of any\nvertebrate population. In up to 10%\nof people, it\u2019s disabling, and can be\na cause of death in ambulances, as\npatients experience further stress,\nand induced blood pressure change,\ndue to the ambulance\u2019s motion.\nPart of the issue turns out to be\nthe frequency of the motion \u2013 it\nseems we are able to cope with motion which induces high-frequency\noscillations, such riding a horse;\nor with motion where the oscillations are slow, such as those on an\naircraft carrier. But at intermediate\nfrequencies (around 0.2 Hz), such\nas those experienced in luxury cars,\nsmall ships, or when riding a camel,\nmany of us become nauseous.\nBy strapping more test subjects\ninto a different chair, which could\nbe oscillated back and forth, and\ntilted too (just seeing it was enough\nto make this reviewer feel queasy),\nGresty and his colleagues found this\ncritical frequency exists because of\nthe way people experience motion.\nLow-frequency oscillations are\nperceived as being tilted, whereas\nhigher frequencies are perceived as\ntrue oscillations; and the body has\nmechanisms, such as rolling the\neyes or flicking them laterally, designed to reinforce this perception.\nHowever, at 0.2 Hz, Gresty found\nthere was a transition between the\ntwo types of experience, with the\ntest subjects\u2019 eyes both rolling and\nmoving laterally, suggesting motion\nsickness is due to the body\u2019s mechanisms for coping with motion being\nconfused. A good reason not to volunteer for trials like these!\nRock and Roll Edmund Henley\nHappy as a cloud. But is the representation of science in programmes like \u201cThe Great Global Warming\nSwindle\u201d, and the media at large worse than nebulous? Misleading even?\nMy hump, my hump, my hump.

    "content": "Clouding the issue: cosmic rays\nCosmoclimatology claims cosmic rays affect cloud cover; CLOUD, an experiment at CERN, will investigate.\nEdmund Henley\nScience Editor\nCosmoclimatology is one of the\nmore contentious theories invoked\nto explain global warming. Still a\nminority view, it contends that one\nmajor contributor might not be\nman-made, but natural \u2013 that the\ninteraction between the sun\u2019s magnetic field and cosmic rays might\nbe affecting the clouds, and hence\nthe climate. At a very simple level,\nit likens the atmosphere to cloud\nchambers, the very early detectors\nused to observe sub-atomic parti-cles. To test this theory, scientists\nat CERN have constructed CLOUD\n(Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets \u2013 as ever in science, a rather\nforced acronym), a modern equivalent to these detectors, which will\nbe subjected to an artificial cosmic\nray shower from the particle accelerators there.\nBefore describing the experiment\nthough, it\u2019s worth having a quick\nlook at the theory. Cosmic rays are\nmostly protons (though sometimes\nheavier particles or nuclei) often\noriginating outside our solar sys-tem, which have been accelerated\nto high energies \u2013 in some cases\npossibly by supernovae. The most\nenergetic can exceed 1020\neV, about\nthe same energy as a well-bowled\ncricket ball \u2013 fairly hefty for something so much smaller. Because\nthey are charged, cosmic rays are\naffected by magnetic fields, such as\nthat of the sun \u2013 its field contains\nstructures which can act as magnetic barriers to the particles.\nIt\u2019s well-known that the sun goes\nthrough an 11-year cycle, during\nwhich sunspots become more fre-quent, before disappearing again;\nit\u2019s less well-known that this is also\ntied in with the sun\u2019s magnetic field.\nAs the cycle heads towards solar\nmaximum, when sunspot number\nincreases, the solar magnetic field\nbecomes more complex, affecting\nthecosmic-rayshieldingstructures,\nso that fewer cosmic rays reach the\nearth. When the solar cycle heads\ntowards a minimum however, the\nsituation is reversed: the shielding\neffect is not so strong, so more cosmic rays reach earth.\nButhowwouldthiscyclicvariation\nin cosmic rays affect the climate?\nWhen cosmic rays impinging on the\nearth reach the troposphere, the\nlayer of the atmosphere between\nthe ground and approximately 10km\naltitude, they often collide with air\nmolecules, creating ions. Cosmoclimatology maintains that these ions\nmay then be able to affect the formation of the nuclei around which\nwater vapour condenses (or freez-es), to form the droplets (or ice par-ticles) which make up a cloud. Or\nthey may change the atmospheric\nchemistry affecting the presence of\nvapour.\nThere have been some results,\nhotly contested, which suggest that\nlow-level clouds (below about 3km)\nmay be more frequent when there\nare more cosmic rays. An increase\nin the number of such clouds would\nreflect more of the sun\u2019s light,\nleading to a cooler climate. But\nwhy would this be linked with global warming? From both historical measurements of the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetic field, and records of isotope abundances (such as 10\nBe), it\nis thought the solar magnetic field\nmay have increased over the last\nhundred years, and cosmic rays\nencountering earth subsequently\ndecreased, creating fewer low-level\nclouds to cool the planet, and hence\nleading to an increase in global\ntemperatures.\nHowever, much of the evidence\ncosmoclimatology adherents claim\nsupports their theory is disputed\nby other scientists. And crucially,\nthe mechanisms by which cosmic\nrays may eventually create cloud\ncondensation nuclei are unclear.\nCLOUD, a \u00a36.2 million experiment,\nis designed to address this uncer-tainty, investigating (over 8 years)\nif and how these mechanisms oc-cur. At its heart lie two chambers,\na 0.5m diameter cloud chamber,\nand a 2m reaction chamber, which\ncan be filled with a variety of gases found in the atmosphere, and\nwhose temperature and pressure\ncan be altered to recreate conditions anywhere in the troposphere\nor stratosphere. Water vapour\nsuper-saturation levels of around\n1% will also mimic nature, making CLOUD rather different from\nclassical cloud chambers, where\nsaturation levels were hundreds of\ntimes higher. Lastly, electric fields\nmatching those in clouds can also\nbe generated.\nCERN was chosen as it can generate a particle beam matching the\nenergies of the section of the cosmic\nray spectrum thought to be relevant \u2013 the whole experiment can be\nflooded with a beam of muons and\npions with energies from 1-3.5\u00d7109\neV, and with fluxes between 1-10\ntimes the cosmic ray levels. This\nbeam can also be turned off, allowing researchers to observe the experiment under conditions where\nonly \u201cnatural\u201d or background cosmic rays are present.\nA whole host of detectors surround the two chambers, including\nCCD imagers and Mie scattering\ndetectors (to observe any droplet\nformed), mass spectrometers, and\ntrace gas analysers \u2013 ensuring\nthe effort expended to create this\nprecisely tuneable experimental\natmosphere is rewarded, with little of what is going on escaping\nobservation.\nThe researchers hope to use\nthese observations to clarify how\nions created by cosmic rays affect\nvarious processes, such as the creation of condensation nuclei from\nvarious trace vapours (eg sulphuric acid); how these condensation\nnuclei grow to become cloud condensation nuclei; how these are\nthen activated when water vapour\nis present; and the formation of ice\nnuclei.\nCLOUD suffered a postponement\ndue to funding issues with CERN\u2019s\nflagship LHC experiment, but a\nprototype detector finally started\ninitial operations last October. Initial results from the prototype are\nexpected this summer, and results\nfrom the full experiment are expected in 2010.\nSince the political will to address\nglobal warming is finally being\nmustered, on the basis that most\nevidence to date suggests it is an-thropogenic, a theory which absolves humanity of even part of its\nresponsibility in causing the warming needs to be tested very vigor-ously, and CLOUD will do just that\nfor cosmoclimatology. Such testing\nis important not only to address the\nlegitimate concerns of other scien-tists, but also to allay the equally\nlegitimate concerns of the public\nand politicians \u2013 that policies with\nwide-reaching effects are based on\nthe best science available; and to\ngive the lie to fears there may be an\nestablishment scientific view which\ndogmatically dismisses alternative\nexplanations, without testing their\nvalidity. Not investigating, and leaving an appearance of doubt, risks\nproviding fodder to those on the ex-tremes, who thrive on skewing science to support their agendas.\nSo despite the controversial nature of the science it is investi-gating, the progress on CLOUD\nshould be welcomed, even by those\nwho suspect it is looking for effects\nwhich are of little or no importance.\nFor even if CLOUD comes up with\na null result, money will not have\nbeen wasted, as the principle of science will have been pursued.\nA supernova remnant. CLOUD will investigate the contentious claim cosmic rays from sources like these\ncould affect cloud formation, and hence be a significant contributor to global warming.\nShafted. Muon fluxes at IceCube are linked to temperatures 10km up\nAn interesting counterpart to the\ncosmoclimatology theory is being\ninvestigated by Oxford\u2019s Dr Scott\nOsprey, amongst others. At a talk at\nImperial a few months ago, he presented some initial results, which\nare obtained by turning the cosmo-climatology concept on its head:\nrather than looking at the effect of\ncosmic rays on climate, he\u2019s one of\na team of researchers investigating\nthe climate\u2019s effect on cosmic rays.\nA shower of high-energy muons\n(a heavier version of an electron) is\ncaused by the collision of primary\ncosmic rays with air molecules near\nthe Upper Troposphere LowerStratosphere (UTLS) boundary, a\nregion about 10-20km up. However,\nthe probability of collision should\ndepend very much on the air density\n(denser air provides more targets\nfor the primary cosmic rays) \u2013 and\nhence, by the ideal gas law, muon\nproduction should also depend on air\ntemperature.\nMuons which result from such\ncollisions are routinely observed at\nparticle detectors around the world,\nsuch as MINOS (USA), MACRO\n(Italy), and IceCube (Antarctica).\nThe latter facility is a collection of\nspherical detectors on cables longer\nthan the Eiffel Tower, like beads on\nstrings, hanging down deep shafts in\nthe ice. Like MINOS (and to a lesser\nextent MACRO), it is in fact designed\nto monitor the flux of much lighter\nneutrinos, but to do this researchers\nneed to remove the signal caused\nby muons \u2013 not an easy task according to Dr Osprey. However, when it\nis done, this separation yields a by-product, a count of muons generated\nby cosmic rays.\nComparing the flux of high-energy\nmuons (above 1012\neV, as they live\nlong enough to interact with the air)\nwith ECMWF temperature data (a\ndata set which combines observations and modelling to provide global\ncoverage), Dr Osprey found there\nwas a strong link between the temperature at the UTLS and the muon\nflux. When asked by Felix, he noted\nthese results were not mere correla-tion; supported by good physical\ngrounds,theyshowastrongcausal\nlink, making muon flux more than\njust a proxy of the temperature at\nthe UTLS.\nBeing able to plumb the atmosphere remotely over one detec-tor, taking its temperature using\nmuons, is all very well, but Dr\nOsprey also pointed out that using\nseveral detectors in different locations may be much more interest-ing, as it will allow meteorological-ly meaningful parameters, such as\nwind (which depends on temperature gradients), to be investigated.\nAnd lastly, it\u2019s interesting to note\nhis results really are looking at\nthe effect of the climate on cosmic\nrays, and not the obverse \u2013 the\nhigh energies of the muons he was\nlooking at meant they originated\nfrom cosmic rays which would\nthemselves be energetic enough\nnot to be greatly affected by the solar magnetic field, and so unlikely\nto be playing a role in any cosmic-ray induced climate variation.\n4 felix Friday 11 May 2007\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Atmospheric physics: spooky!\nAn interview with Imperial\u2019s Professor Joanna Haigh starts off this issue, which focusses on climate science\nIn 2001, IC\u2019s Professor Joanna\nHaigh was the only female Professor of Atmospheric Physics in\nBritain. Ceri Perkins went to meet\nProf. Haigh to find out about her\nresearch and discuss her views on\nthe current climate change debate.\nWhat attracted you to study\natmospheric physics? What is the\nfocus of your current research?\nI did a physics degree many years\nago, at the end of which I thought\nthat I never wanted to do any physics ever again! When I sat down to\nconsider what it was that I actually\nenjoyed, I realised that it was studying the environment, and in particular the weather. I\u2019d actually had a\nweather station in my back garden\nsince my school days \u2013 I was a real\ngeek! I took an MSc in Meteorology\nat Imperial, and followed that with\na DPhil in Atmospheric Physics at\nOxford. It was very theoretical, but\nit\u2019s amazing how motivated you can\nbe when you have a personal interest in the topic!\nMy current research covers\ntransport of solar radiation in the\natmosphere. Specifically, over the\nlast few years I\u2019ve been looking at\nthe relationship between solar irra-diance and climate.\nDo you think that the prospect of\ntackling the climate change issue\nis attracting more women to the\nsubject?\nOur research group certainly\nattracts a larger proportion of female PG students than any other\nresearch group in physics at IC. I\nput it down to the fact that women\nare more attracted to environmental issues. I think it\u2019s also a case of\nwomen seeing other women doing\nwell in the field, which generates in-terest. We support each other!\nWhat do you see as the role of\nclimate scientists?\nOur job is to explain and understand the fundamental science going on, and to relay that information\nto policy makers. Climate prediction needs to be based on solid sci-ence, not politics and polemic.\nHow have you seen public attitudes to the climate change issue\nchange over time?\nThat area has become much less\npleasant; the debate has become\npolarised. You\u2019ve got environmental activists on one side, and people who deny the existence of a\nproblem, or at least one caused by\nhuman activity, on the other. Currently, there doesn\u2019t seem to be\nmuch of a middle ground where we\ncan outline frankly what we do and\ndon\u2019t know. On the basis of what\nwe do know, we think that human\nactivity is influencing the climate,\nbut this understanding includes error bars and uncertainties. It\u2019s difficult to put over to the public these\nuncertainties.\nDo you think the press have had\na significant role in polarising the\ndebate?\nYes, but then that\u2019s the way that\nthey always do things. People have\nexploited the press. The press do\nhave a tendency to exaggerate, but\nthey don\u2019t fabricate stories.\nIt has been argued that Global\nClimate Model (GCM) predictions\nare weak as they fail to account\nproperly for spatial variations in\ncloud thickness, or the extent to\nwhich radiation is reflected by ice\nat the poles. Where do you stand\non this?\nIt is very difficult to simulate\nclouds. I agree that the spatial resolution in the models is not good, and\nthat the detailed physical processes of cloud formation are not well\naccounted for. Whilst the models do\nhave reasonable representations of\nmany features, such as the Intertropical Convergence Zone and El\nNi\u00f1o, others, for example the diurnal variation of tropical convection\nclouds over Africa, are less well\ndescribed. Representing the physical properties of ice is also difficult.\nThe question is to what extent we\ncan use model predictions as a basis from which to respond to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The\nphysics as we know it is in there\nand we do know that models of the\ncurrent and historical climates\ncorrespond well to observed and\nmeasured values. This allows us to\nplace reasonable confidence in the\nmodels\u2019 predictions.\nWhat about the arguments which\nblame climate change on natural\nvariability and long-term cycles?\nClearly there is natural variation:\nwe\u2019re dealing with a hugely complex system. Using data from both\nvery long runs of models \u2013 where\nwe can look at the internal noise in\nsystem \u2013 and oxygen isotopes in ice\ncores, it would appear that changes\nover the last 50 years have been\noutside the bounds of natural vari-ation. There may have been larger\ntemperature changes in the past,\nbut these changes occurred over\nmuch longer time-scales.\nIs it possible to tackle climate\nchange at the governmental level,\nor does the action need to come\nfrom individuals? Are initiatives\nsuch as carbon emissions trading\nreally just token gestures which\ndetract from the real issue: that\npeople\u2019s energy consumption\nhabits need to change?\nIt most definitely needs to be\ntackled on a personal level, but the\ngovernment has a role to play too.\nPeople have little choice in how\ntheir power is generated. It is unlikely that there will be any real difference made without government\nlitigation. The smoking ban is a\ngreat example of where legislation\ncan give people that little push in\nthe right direction.\nEven if the USA and Australia\nwere to join up, is Kyoto enough?\nNo, it\u2019s not. Even if GHG emis-Can YOU take the heat? A SOHO image of our nearest star\nsions were capped at today\u2019s levels,\nwarming would continue for well\nover 50 years due to the inertia in\nthe oceans.\nWhy are certain areas of the\npublic still resistant to the idea of\nclimate change?\nA mixture of reasons. Principally,\npeople don\u2019t like to be told what\nto do and they don\u2019t like the idea\nof changing their behaviour. They\ndon\u2019t make rational decisions based\non the bigger picture, they just think\nabout how changes will impact\nupon them personally. There is also\na political angle which sees people\nwith business interests resistant to\nbeing told that industry is partly to\nblame for the changes we\u2019re beginning to see.\nRecent research by Henrik Svensmark suggests that the seeding\nof tropospheric clouds by cosmic\nrays may be responsible for climate change, not anthropogenic\nGHGs. This has also been picked\nup on Channel 4\u2019s \u201cThe Great\nClimate Change Swindle\u201d, and in\nNigel Calder\u2019s book \u201cThe Chilling\nStars: A New Theory of Climate\nChange\u201d. Where do you stand on\nthis?\nYou\u2019ve got to turn the argument\naround. If this is responsible for\nthe warming over the past 50 years,\nthen why haven\u2019t we seen similar\neffects in the past? This isn\u2019t to\nsay that solar phenomenon have\nno effect. Our understanding of the\neffects of the 11\u2013year solar cycle\non climate, for example, is statistically robust, but we can\u2019t explain\nGlobal Warming over the last 150\nyears through solar activity alone.\nThe cosmoclimatology article is a\ngross simplification of the original\nresearch, although the simplification in this case was actually done\nby one of the authors of the original\narticle!\nWhat is your response to people\nwho claim that science is not\njoined up enough? Do you think\nthat greater integration of the\ndifferent disciplines would have\nanything to offer the climate\nchange debate?\nYes, in the sense that we might\nknow how to direct our understanding to the areas where it is of most\nuse. But we do need to exercise\ncaution when taking that attitude.\nSo-called \u2018Earth System Models\u2019\nwhich take into account the atmos-phere, ocean, biosphere, economics\nand everything in between run the\nrisk of propagating errors as each\npart of the system is subject to its\nown uncertainties.\nNot at all scary really, despite our feeble title (though that picture of the sun could intimidate weaker\nminds); Professor Haigh researches the relationship between solar irradiance and climate\n3\nfelix\nFriday 11 May 2007\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCeri Perkins\n\n"

    "content": "What is wrong with this College?\nFor all the acclaim Imperial College has received (9th best in the world, ranked first for some subjects in the\nUK), all is not well with this place. An ex-student calls out Sir Richard on some of the worst aspects of here\nDear Sir,\nSir Richard Sykes is probably quite\npleased with himself at the mo-ment: independence for Imperial\nCollege and a listing in the top ten\nof world universities.\nBut, via Felix, I would like to ask\nhim the following questions:\n1. Does he think that the heavy\ndrinking culture at Imperial detracts from its image?\n2. Does he think the poor quality\nand paucity of student accommodation at Imperial detracts from its\nimage?\n3. Does he think that the absence\nof a proper arts faculty at Imperial\ndetracts from its image?\n4. Does he think that the relative\nlack of female students at Imperial\ndetracts from its image?\nI would answer \u2018Yes\u2019 to all these\nquestions.\nI was fortunate to live in Lillian\nPenson Hall for one year - a University of London Postgraduate Hall of\nResidence in Paddington. There\nwere 470 students there from 77 different countries. They were mostly\nstudying non technical subjects\nat the other consituent colleges of\nthe University of London. It was\nfantastic - a real intellectual and\nsocial hothouse. By breaking away\nfrom the University of London,\nSir Richard has lost out on such\nopportunities.\nYours faithfully,\nMark Lee\nMaterials 1986-1990\nAndy Sykes replies,\nI\u2019d thought I\u2019d reply to this, as it is\nhighly unlikely Sir Richard would\ndeem to address your questions.\nFirstly, some background: I\u2019ve\nbeen at this College for five years.\nI\u2019ve had friends who have been\nhere for longer. Before I sat down to\nwrite this, I asked them what they\nthought of their experience here.\nAlmost all of them had a negative\nview of the College, varying between a vague indifference to outright hate. I\u2019d consider myself in\nthe latter category.\nFirstly, Mark is right about the\nheavy drinking culture. Whereas at\nother universities, the drinking culture is a little more moderate (after\nthe natural excess of the first year),\nhere drinking seems to be a reason\nunto itself; we drink to get drunk.\nSecondly, the selection process\nfor this place tends to skew the\npopulation badly, reducing the diversity of students we get. My view\nis that most people have few, if any,\ninterests outside their main area of\nstudy. These people tend to be either\nvery smart, or very good at work-ing. Both of these seem to hamper\nsocial ability; I\u2019ve had countless\nconversations with random students from around the College who\ncannot manage to maintain eye\ncontact while talking.\nConversations often consist of\nsuch riveting topics of lecturers we\nlike, what courses were hard, and\nwhat investment bank we want\nto work for. It is not what I\u2019d call a\nintellectual and social hothouse in\nany way, shape or form.\nThe College piles work on its\nstudents, and proclaims this to be\ngood. Apparently, this will make\nyou a better scientist, when in fact\nall it does is make you a quivering,\nstressed wreck by your fourth year.\nYou\u2019re given very little free time,\nby design, and the vast majority\nof what you must do is either rote\nlearning or mindless, uncreative\ndrudgery.\nOnly very late on in your degree\nare you given a chance to work\nalone and on your initiative. This\ntends to generate boring, incredibly\nfocussed people.\nThis lack of free time means that\nany sense of community here suffers horribly. This ties in with a lack\nofanartsfaculty;artsstudentstend\nto have more time, and more creative faculties, which seem to bind a\nstudent population together.\nClubs provide the only outlet, but\neven these seem flawed. Most are\nintimidating, difficult to get into,\nand often run by an \u2018old boys\u2019 network that, to a fresher, is rather off-putting. Don\u2019t get me wrong; many\nare fantastic, but I begin to feel\nthese are the exception rather than\nthe rule.\nThe College is split on gender and\nrace; you can see it everywhere\nyou look. Integration is minimal.\nOverseas students stick with overseas students, and home stick with\nhome, effectively creating two coexisting colleges. Admittedly, this\nis a symptom of broader society,\nbut the effect is heightened by the\nsmaller population here.\nThis is not a University; it\u2019s too\nnarrow-minded and repressive\nto be called that. You\u2019re supposed\nto meet people here that you\u2019ll befriend for the rest of your life, and\nit should be one of the most liberating experiences you\u2019ll ever have.\nCan you honestly say that these\ntwo conditions have been satisfied?\nWhen I look at the experiences old\nfriends have had in other universi-ties, I feel jealous.\nI regret coming here, and I don\u2019t\nthink I\u2019m alone in feeling that.\nSub-Warden Position\nBeit Hall\nA sub-warden position is available in Beit Hall.\nThe responsibilities include pastoral care of 310 undergraduate\nstudents, and organising the social life of Beit Hall, within a team\nof 8 Wardening staff. The position will involve significant\ncommitment of time, energy and responsibility during evenings\nand weekends. No payment is available, but rent-free\naccommodation is provided within the Hall. The post would best\nmatch a PG student but all members of College with more than\n15 months remaining full-time student registration or\nemployment contract are eligible. The position is available from\nAugust 2007.\nTo apply you must complete an application form. Application\nforms and further information can be downloaded from\nwww.union.ic.ac.uk/halls/beit/\nInformal enquiries are welcome \u2013 please contact Dr Tamer Zaki\non t.zaki@imperial.ac.uk.\nDeadline for receipt of applications:\n18:00 on Friday 1st June 2007.\nomment&\nOpinion\n7\nfelix\nFriday 11 May 2007\nC\n\n"
