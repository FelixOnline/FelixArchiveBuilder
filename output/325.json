He says, even if Lord Penney does without, we can't have\nmore than a \u00a3250 rise.\"\nMOTION\nto be put to Thursday's Extraordinary General Meeting SUPPLEMENTARY GRANTS The following motion will be proposed at the EG Mon Thursday. In recent months prices of essentials such as food, rents and transport have risen faster than ever before. In the last two months alone prices rose by6 percent which is an annual rate of36 percent. This Union therefore demands Supplementary Grants as cash payments each time the cost of living rises. The rapid rate of inflation makes it essential for students to have more money now. September will be too late, many students will be faced with the choice of looking for jobs in exam time org of hg without proper food. Further, Heath's White Paper takes away any bargaining rights for grants as with wages. What is the purpose of a student union which cannot bargain or take any action for grant increases without facing stiff penalties and fines.T his makes a grants campaign absolutely urgent and makes it clear that it must be linked to the demand to clear this reactionary Tory Government out of office.\nThis Union therefore resolves to:(1) Campaign for Supplementary Grants linked to the demand to clear the Tory Government from office.\n( 2 ) Immediately elect from the Union meeting an8 member action committee to organize the following campaign. a) A one day strike on Thursday, February8 th and a demonstration in preparation for the day of action on February21 st. That in order to ensure the maximum possible support for the campaign the action committee must contact and work with London Region NUS and all student bodies, arrange speakers at meetings and organize meetings where student unions are weak or nonexistent. Further, contact local Trades councils. Union Branches and shop stewards committees for support for the campaign. end of motion.

Huge ferns towered over the trio, and the ground was thick with botanical debris. Strange sounds assaulted the explorers' ear s,hooting, screaming \u2014 was that a cry for help in Mongolian, that an invitation to lunch in Serbo Croat? They would never know. With the Twig worm bulldozing a path through the undergrowth, they pressed on. It was very hot. Through the diffuse green light that bathed the jungle, they could see only a few steps ahead. Things rustled in the shrubbery, crashed through the ferns overhead, and howled in the greenness. Did other, heavier footsteps echo their own?\"Er, Ferocious,\" said Phosphorous,\" do you think we're doing the right thing? Couldn't we go back to the beach and per-hap s wait for the Twig wor mery there?\" As it happened Ferocious had been thinking along those lines himself.\" For once, dear lad, you have a point. We seem to be making very little progress through this un savoury jungle, and I get the distinct impression that tiny carnivores of an unfriendly nature are scaling my left leg. I therefore propose that were turn to the beach. All those in favour \u2014 ah \u2014\nfavour? Excellent \u2014 carried unanimously. Off you go,d ear old treader of the way, take us to the beach.\" The Twig worm looked confused.\" Which way is that, please?\" he asked.\" Oh really,\" said Ferocious sharply,\" with you in the lead we must have left a trail like the Ml extension.\" He peered hopefully around. They seemed surrounded by impenetrable jungle.\" Eh?\" thought Ferocious. The unlikely had occurred again. On all sides rose up a wall of solid greenery; like Kew Gardens with sound effects. \" Oh,\" said Ferocious,\" can anyone remember which way the i oll y old beach lie s,hah a.\" Nobody could.\" Urn,\" said Ferocious. They were in a quandary. A dark, green, impenetrable quandary.\" We must think, rational is e, come to a decision,\" said Ferocious, staring hopefully into the green menace all around them. Even as he spoke, Phosphorous gave a cry. A thin green tendril had encircled his leg, and was pulling him off into a bush.\" Ooo ooo erg h!\" he said.\" Grab h irn, Twig!\" shouted Ferocious. But it was too late, insidious ropes had encircled the protesting Job rot, and he was fast\ndisappearing into the undergrowth. Ferocious and the Twig worm lunged after their captured friend, but as they moved, wriggling boneless arms grasped and held them. Even the Twig worm's huge strength was not enough to break free of the arbor i al grasp. Deep in the writhing mass of greenery, avast sap dripping mouth swung open.\" Eaten by a rhododendron,\" thought Ferocious, quite calmly,\" what an end for the last of the Dins.\" The trio were within seconds of a shrubbery death, when a voice rang out.\" Down boy, leave!\" The greenery grasp relaxed, and Ferocious and Co. were able to stagger to their feet and greet their saviour. He had all the appearance of a small tree.\" Well,\" thought Ferocious,\" if you can be\neaten by a plant, I suppose you can be rescued by one.\"\" Ido apologise,\" said the tree,\" Fi dodoes tend to be a little rough, I hope he has n't damaged you at all.\"\" No,no, thankyou,\" said Ferocious,\" We seem to be all right, it was lucky you came along when you did.\"\" Oh,\" said the tree,\" Fi do wouldn't have hurt you, just held you until I arrived.\" Phosphorous doubted that but said nothing.\" Let me introduce myself,\" went on the tree,\" I'm George Deciduous, the Jungle Controller. Hang on a minute, and I'll come out.\" So saying the trunk of the tree wriggled and suddenly unzipped. From in sidestepped a dapper little man in pinstriped suit and bowler hat.\" That' s better,\" he remarked,\" it gets very stuffy in there, but it's the only way I can move through the jungle without being eaten by a passing privet, or such like. Not all our flora areas friendly as Fi do here,\"\" You surprise me,\" said Ferocious.\" Now,\" went on George,\" we must get you out of here; you must come to my outpost and have a cup of tea.\" The adven*turers felt in no position to argue, so they followed George, who had assumed his trunk again, into the undergrowth.\" Don't worry,\" said George as they trudged along,\" with Fi do coming too, nothing will dare attack us.\" They had not actually noticed Fi do coming too, but now that they looked, they could see no track behind them, for a huge section of the jungle was slowly moving in their wake.\" Very reassuring,\" said Ferocious. After only a few minutes ploughing through the jungle, they broke out into a clearing. In the middle stood a tree. Or was it a tree? The first forty feet were covered in bark, and sprouted branches at appropriate intervals. Above the forty foot mark, however, there perched a suburban house complete with lace curtains and television aerial.\" Very pleasant, isn't it?\" said George.\" When I first came here, they transported my house from Willesden, so that I'd feel at home. Very thoughtful, don't you think?\"\" Very,\" said Ferocious..\" Let's go in,\" said George,\" and get the kettle on.\" They approached the tower, and George produced a key from his pockets As he was fiddling with the lockon the cunningly hidden door at the foot of the tower, the clearing seemed to become smaller.\" Oh, Fi do!\" said George,\" Stay, boy! go back,s it!\" The greenery flowed back, and subsided in along coil around the tower;\" He really is a marvellous watch bush, you know,\" said George, opening his front door and leading the trio inside. The Twig worm could only just squeeze in, but managed it somehow. From the now guest filled entrance hall there led a narrow winding stairway, up the middle of the tower. With much pushing and shoving they managed to persuade the Twig worm up the long staircase, and out on to the platform on which George's house rested. The view over the jungle was magnificent. A great heaving carpet of greenery lay before them. It rose and fell like some sleeping serpent in the throes of a nightmare. In the distance they could make out the beach which they had left such a short time before. Behind them the jungle stretched out as far as they could see.\n\" So much for the walk to the other side of the island idea,\" thought Ferocious, what a fool he had been. His out of character self criticism was interrupted by George,\" Do come in,\" said the Jungle Controller,\" and we'll see about that cup of tea,\" That did not seem such a bad idea, so in they went. George's house was small and tidy. The front room into which they squeezed displayed a fringed s of a, and plaster ducks in flight on the wall.\" Make yourselves at home,\" said their host, and vanished into the kitchen.\" Very cosy,\" said Ferocious, crushed be-*\ntween the Twig worm and the wall. The poor Twig worm was not designed for small suburban dwellings. He tried to s it very still, so as not to break anything. Phosphorous perched on an upright chair in the corner. There came a clatter from outside.\" What' s that?\" asked Phosphorous,\" can you see, Ferocious?\" From his Twig worm dominated position Ferocious could see nothing.\" It's only the wind,\" he said hopefully. It was not only the wind. With a crash of splintering plywood, George's front door burst in. Two figures charged into the room.\" Donna nobody move!\" said Dino Confetti. DOWNTOWN . . .\n. . . . is a learning experience, an event, rather than a conference. It's a workshop for London students who want to see for themselves what's going on\nwith \u2014 housing, play, redevelopment and planning, alternative education, trans-port, etc. \u2014 by meeting the people working in these areas; by going around Lon don, talking and looking.\nWith the help of these people, we are devising an extensive list of workshop\nactivities. Each group will take one of the areas, look at it in some depth, share\nideas and experiences of student community action in London \u2014 perhaps generate ideas for future schemes in your own neighbourhood?\nThe workshops are on Housing, Play, Planning, Schools, Mental Health,\nTransport, Welfare Rights, Immigrants and Dossers. The workshop starts on Friday at 7 p.m. at Imperial College Union. Registration fee is just 75p. Why not go along and find out what it's all about? Or ring 580 0966 during the week.\n\n"

Cl j e&C \u00a3 > Pro aba f jeet/4.(3 j>^> o*r* It seems that a large proportion of\nR.C.S. enthusiasts and guilds tw at s are\nunaware of the active rivalry that took\nplace, more or less continuously,\nthroughout last term, between the unions\nof these two constituent colleges. So in the Broadsheet opinion column, this\ntime folks, I thought I'd relate the saga\nof friendly (?) rivalry actively portrayed\nby the dubious antics of factions from\nR.C.S. and guilds.\nWell, it all started one afternoon when\na herd of guilds tw at s attired for some\noutdoor sporting activity or other\nstormed into the R. C.S.U. office, made\nvarious mumbling s and groaning s( not\nentirely dissimilar to a herd of Gumbies\nreading out the telephone directory \u2014\nwell attempting -to pronounce the first\nword in the directory), and then wandered off again. Shortly after their departure a keen-eyed member of the\nR.C.S. exec, noted the union office sign\nthat used to prop up the corner of the\noffice was mi sing. At once a deadening\nhush fell upon the assembled multitude\nwhen the devastating horror of it came\nhome \u2014 IT HAD JUST( BEEN NICKED! Revenge was called for, and a couple\nof days later the R.C.S. Revenge Squad\nMk. I returned the compliment of an inter-collegiate union office visit and not being able to find our office sign\n(the cowardly guilds tw at s not having\ndared to store it in their office in Mechanical Engineering), they returned\nwith a large \" London Wax Works\nMuseum\" notice board that had been\nfilched during the filming of \" Out Damned Spot!\" (see a past Broadsheet\nfor review of events) in Prince Consort\nRoad. Pretty this notice was not, however it was some form of trophy now\nand so lay gathering dust in our office\nfor some weeks until a second large\nsquad of guilds tw at s repossessed it on\nthe night of the R.C.S. Smoking Concert,\nthere not being many people in the\noffice at the time as just about everyone\nof course was at the Concert. ( And a splendid event it was too).\nOnce again revenge was called for and\nso the R.C.S. Revenge Squad Mk. II, in the form of a solitary masked figure\ngained access to the guilds office and\nstill not being able to find our office\nsign decided to relieve guilds of a collection of half a dozen flashy yellow\nplastic shields. Five of these then\nadorned our hallowed shrine for some\ntime during which we were paid curious\nvisits from individual guilds personages\nwho were still trying to work out how they had lost the shields.\nNow one quiet lunchtime our hardworking duplicating officer was bringing\nvast quantities of paper into the office\nall on 'is tod. This paper having been\nordered for us by aMr.O. Dowson was\nall the wrong colour, but be that as it\nmay, some observant guild gum bie s saw\ntheir opportunity, and despite the brave\nefforts of our gallant reproducing\nchap pie, managed to retrieve their\nshields.\nYup! You guessed it, R.C.S. Revenge\nSquad Mk. II, in the late hours one\nnight got into the guilds office and found\nit even more smelly than usual. Acting on a hunch they began a search for the\ninebriated body of tariq (guilds vice-pre s.) but soon found the\nsource of the obnoxious stench\nto be the puny collection of\nrotting Morphy Day fruit guilds had stored in one corner. Our lads being\nin a benevolent mood decided to remove this muck from guilds office and\nleft only a small amount behind. Now it seems guilds didn't want this either\nsince it was found the following morning\nin a heap in front of our office door.\nThreats were also issued that if their\nfruit was not returned the R.S.C. office\nwould (in the usual elegant and sophisticated style so often associated with\nguilds \"be done over by our lads like\". Now since a carnival committee meeting was\ndue to be held at 1.00 this was an interesting state of affairs. The meeting\nwas held elsewhere at the last minute\nand those of you who wondered why a crowd of gum hie impersonators were\nstaggering about Southside on Morphy Day, swaying their arms and groaning\n\"there's nobody there!\" now know the\nfull story.\nMore developments, if and when they\nhappen, in future Broadsheet/Felix\ncolumns folks.

Commenting on the\nreasons behind these\nmeasures he continued,\n\" Owing to the present\nWorld crisis in capitalism\nwe, as the executive of the\nruling class, are forced to\nlower the standard of living of the working class in\norder to lower the value\nof labour and thus maintain our profits\u2014whoops,\nwhat a give away!\" No one can expect a rise of\nmore than \u00a35 per week\nover the next three years\nin the totally new wage\nnegotiation structures proposed in the Government\nWhite Paper issued last\nWednesday.\nBarmy\nHowever inessential\ncommodities such as food\nwill have no restrictions\non price rises, likewise\nanything from abroad,\nanything subject to seasonal or externally caused\nprice fluctuations or whose\nprice is fixed by international agreement, or any\nmanufactured goods whose price rises are due\nto \"unavoidable\" cost in-creases. This leaves . . .\nwell if you can think of\nany goods or services not\nincluded in the above list,\nsend your answers on a postcard please to E. Heath, c/o St. Gumby home for those with incurable speech defects, 10\nDowning Street, etc.\nDaft\n\" I'm not as daft as you\nthink, ejaculated Mr. Anthony Barber, Chancellor\nof the Exchequer, his fingers tightening on a copy\nof the \" New Humanist\",\nalthough 1 admit it has\ntaken over 2\\ years since\nwe took office to think up\na suitable name for the\nplan that would succeed\nPhase 1.\"\nSilly\nIn a typical altruistic\nmove, which we have\ncome to think of as the\nhall-mark of the Heath\nadministration, the present\nrent allowance for lower\npaid workers will be increased slightly so that in\nthree years time they\n\"would normally pay no\nmore than now\". \" But these are not normal\ntimes,\" stressed Mr. Barber. \"They are times of\ngreat stress. As we have\nmade all strikes and\nthreatening to strike il leg al, and we're working on\na thinking about beginning\nto start to maybe conceive\nof threatening to strike\nbill to be incorporated in to our conspiracy laws\".\nSillier\nLists of sycophantic adjectives have been rushed\nto all the main newspaper\noffices in time for a critical analysis of the govern-ment's every move over\nthe next few months.\nPromises have been given\nby the leaders of all major\ntrades unions to put up a short-lived indignation at\nthis latest attack on the\nliving standards of the\nWorking class. \"Strictly off\nthe record, old boy,\" continued Mr. Barber, \"1\nsimply have no idea how\nmuch longer their grass\nroots membership will\nallow itself to be fobbed\noff with this kind of hog-wash.\"\nSilliest\nIn a statement on Dividends, Mr. Heath said\n\"This is the crux of our\nmoves, dividend increases\nwill have a ceiling twice\nthat of wage increases.\nAny profit over and above\nthe ceiling, we shall\nplough back into the firm\nand so increase our share\nvalues.\"\nTalking about student\ngrant increases, he con-tin u ed,\" Not a chance,\nthey are no different from\nworkers. I said this is a fair deal and we're going\nto be fair; we'll screw\neverybody.\"\nWhen questioned on\ninflation, he replied, \" Of course these moves will\ncause inflation, hence they\nwill lower the standard of\nliving of the working\nclass, and so lower the\nvalue of labour and thus\nwe can maintain our falling profits, which is the\nsole point of our moves.\nNo, the only way the\nworking class can stop us\nnow is to kick us out and\nreturn a government\npledged to socialist poli-cie s, but they're much too\nstupid to do that!\"\nDepartmental meeting on the issues\naffecting the Union can be effective in strengthening our democracy.\nThe first one, on the grants cam-pa ign, Chemistry, proposed that IC organise a mass write-in to the Dept. of\nEducation and Science and a demonstration on Wednesday, February 7th, so\nthat we can deliver them in large sacks\nto the stuffed shirted civil servants and\nsend in a deputation. The idea is firstly\nto get mass involvement of students in\nsomething that can be done on a college\nbasis, get some publicity for the grants\nclaim and build up a little more of the\npressure that will be needed for victory.\nIf IC gets moving and does something\nwe can prove that we aren't just talkers\nand compensate to some extent for the\nway we let the other colleges down over\nthe rent strike.\nOur neighbours Queen Elizabeth College have decided to go on rent-strike as\nwell as organising refectory boycotts.\nRefectory Boycotts\nThe last U GM mandated me to report\nback about catering boycotts. The most\neffective way appears to be to publicise\nthat there will be one on a certain day\nbut keep the particular ref. a secret until\njust before opening. Then set up pickets\nto persuade people to go elsewhere.\nIn this way the maximum impact is\nmade with minimum hardship to our-selves.\nA Vindication of Militancy\nThe statement by Prof. Gower, ViceChancellor of Southampton University\nthat the government is heading for a major confrontation with students if it\ndoes not concede our claim quickly and\nrecognising the justice of our claim is\na result of the acute pressure being put\non the Vice-Chancellor by the rent-strikes and catering boycotts.\nThis sort of statement can do us immense good in trying to win over public\nopinion. In fact, the support the rent\nstrikes have won in this way refutes\ncompletely the argument that rent-strikes upset \"public opinion\", overall\nthe opposite has been the case.\nIn this situation it is sad that Lord Penney will not commit himself publicly to our case. Informal chats along\nthe corridors of power will not change\nthis governments policy. Massive actions by students all over the country\nplus support from as many sections of\nthe public as possible, can!\nDrivel!\nFinally, one misconception spread by\nthe Felix editorial last week should be\ncleared up. NUS have every intention of\nnegotiating on higher grants \u2014 the delay\nis from the DES side. The part to be\nplayed by the VC' s is simply a press uris ing one. We would in no sense allow\nthem to negotiate for us.\nMr. Dowson knows this perfectly well\nas Mr. Dowson attends every NUS conference going.\nThe rest of the drivel in his editorial\nisn't worth commenting on! Stirling President Suspended Linda Quinn (pictured left), President\nof Stirling University, was suspended by\nthe university last week.\nA meeting of the university disciplinary committee voted by a majority of\nthree to two to suspend Miss Quinn for\nfour months for her alleged part in the\ndemonstrations during the Queen's visit\nlast October.\nShe in lends to appeal against the sentence and claims there was a lack of\nevidence. She told reporters that she was\nbeing punished for organising the demon-st rations, not for taking part in them.\nCAN SEE THE\nORIGINAL\nUN-CUT VERSION\nOF THE MOST\nTALKED-ABOUT\nWRITTEN-ABOUT\nCONTROVERSIAL\nACCLAIMED\nSENSATIONAL\nFILM OF THE DECADE\n\u2022 IaM JOT KWMtKKS\nFrom Warner Bros \u00ae A Warner Communications Company Released by Columbia Warner Distributors Ltd.

I wrote four letters\nto Felix, asked you if you\nwere printing them and you\nsaid yes. I'm afraid I could\ncall you a liar, or at best\nshort sighted. I remind you\nyou that the four letters were\non one piece of paper, so I think it hardly likely that you\nlost one. The third and most\nimportant letter ran thus:\u2014\n\"Why are there 1000 copies (out of a total 2000 print-ed) of the Christmas issue of\nFelix still in the Felix office\nin four bundles of 250 from\nBaileys, the printers. Also\n250 copies of each of\nfour other editions of last\nterm's Felix. Total cost to the\nUnion\u2014\u00a390.\"\nI see from the line spacing\non the Letters Page, that you\nweren't exactly tight for\nspace in the Letter column.\nI therefore would like to\npoint out, if not to you then\nto the rest of the, readership,\nthat my letter 'Sir, Up Yours'\nappeared \"slightly\" out of\ncontext.\nFor once, I admire your\nmagnanimity in listening to a reader's views i.e.: \"Jobrot\".\nI hope you will pay equal attention to readers who request its continuation.\nI remain, HMJS.\nPaul Jowitt.\nFending for ourselves PJFD lovers\nSir, In reply to Mr. Parker's letter ( Jan.16) we in the student houses clean our own rooms, deliver mail, cook, was hand iron clothes. That is, if we want to, we can;\nthat choice is unavailable to\nthose in hall. Ido not know Mr. Parker. Assuming he has no beard, does he s have? Poor unemployed barbers! If he drives his own car to work, what about poor chauffeurs, taxi, bus, trainor tube drivers he' s putting out of work? Presumably his wife cooks, cleans, etc., for herself, does she have/ need a maid? He says one million are out of work \u2014\nthat was January1972, Mr. Parker, not January1973! What, may I ask, is wrong with doing for oneself those things which one is capable of doing? I may not fill my own teeth, nor remove my own appendix, but I can cook, clean, was hand iron! Being neither British nor Tory, it is unlikely I will ever be knighted; however, his rem ark lends itself readily to\nthe following interesting speculation: if Tory s knight for service to the country, does Labour knight for some other reason? James H. Fenner, Meteorology P.G. Sir,\nI feel compelled to write\nin support of Mr. Parker's let-ter. Just think of all those\nunemployed. Perhaps if we\nwere all as public spirited\nas Ron we would see the\nsolution staring us in the\nface. All that is required is\nfor every student in the country to have his own personal\ncleaner, valet and gentle-man's gentleman. Mr. Bradbury, how could you be so\nthoughtless? I only feel a little disappointed that the\nUnion decided not to have a rent strike. With all that extra money we could all employ our own manservant (or\nmaid perhaps). Just think, all\nthe unemployed swallowed\nup, at a stroke (whoops!).\nI look forward in eager anticipation to Mr. Parker's forthcoming announcement\nthat he will forego his next\nfew pay rises so that the college can afford to employ\nmore cleaners. Congratulations in advance, Mr. Parker,\nO.B. Es. have been won for\nless than that.\nYours sincerely,\nKim Warren.\nDear Sir,\nFacts, Mr. Jo witt.Y our letter was originally left out since I thought it likely to\njeo pardi se our position with advertiser s,Iam now publish ing this second letter at the request of ICU Publications Board. Now, to reply to the original letter: 1, not only were more copies than re-qui red of FELIX Christmas issue delivered, the demand was so slack \u2014 presumably due to the start of the vacation wards rush \u2014 that were more issues to have been distributed, they would have surely gone to waste.2, Co pies of Felix have to beheld back for advertisers, mailing copies, etc. I agree that too many of certain issues have not been distributed. I have rectified the situation.3, I have paid great attention to those requesting\" Job rot's\" continuation. So many people have asked me to continue it, either verbally or by let-ter, that I have decided to\ndo so \u2014 but now, instead of\na further4 instalments, there will be 7 or8 shorter ones. The latest appears on page2. It was with great distress\nthat I heard of the proposed\ntermination of that well loved\nserial \"Phosphorous the Jobrot and Ferocious Din\". I have followed the serial avidly and consider that it must\ngo down in literary history as\nbeing a classic. Its style is\nreminiscent of the great Singhalese writer Abalan Matsridaxxiovy. As we all know\nhe founded the great Bombay\nSchool of Literature. Other\neminent authors belonging to\nthis worthy group included\nRichard F. Hungstein whose\n\"Malayan Mysteries\" was\nwidely read at the turn of the\ncentury and is now as a set\nbook in Eire, and Luigi Lunettes, who coined the phrase\nMonty Python, and Herbert\nWestcott Dabbe, who died\ntragically at the tender age of\nthree when struck on the\nhead by a passing porcelain,\nearly neolithic lavatory cis-tern. Pondering over the perplexities preoccupying the\npetty and puerile puny and\npathetic past president of\nthat Priceless Princely Public\nbody Guilds I became quite\nparan oic, Paul, Piss off\nplease.\nMuch more serious however is the effect the loss of\nthis article would have on\nmy dear friend Frederick\n(a la is Mary) Ponsoby Smythe. I need not tell you who\nhe is, but when \"Men Only\"\nwas seized he suffered acute\nw th draw al symptoms which\nhe only recovered from when\nhe took up making minestrone\nsoup out of the collected\nremnants of the article copies of the recipe were published in the 1918 edition\nThe Land snapper Sneeze of \"Boys own World\" fifth\nedition.\nAnyway must scrub the\nceiling.\nYours,\nR.

We therefore take this opportunity to\npoint out the folly of this\naction requesting that you reappraise the situation and\npublish the remaining four\nepisodes.\nYour failure to do so can\nonly result in a prolonged\nsuspense, culminating in the\neventual total breakdown and\ndecay of society as we know\nit today.\nYours worried,\nP.J.

I cannot\nbut feel however that this\nwill only highlight the lack\nof material that the paper\nhas.\nA few calculations reveal\nthis week, 159 sq. ins. or\none complete page of PJFD,\nand in very small print \"Ad-vert ising Feature\" followed\nby 108 sq. ins. of Life Assurance \u2014 surely we have enough forms of Life Assurance stuffed down our\nthroats through letter racks,\netc., without Felix jumping\non the bandwagon? There is\nanother 62 sq. ins. of advertising, so altogether well\nover a page of advertising. I realise financially advertisements are necessary, but in\nsuch profusion?\nLandsnapper Sneeze\nseems to have grown and\nnow takes up i page and\nfinally a10 sq. ins. block on\nthe culture page announces\n\"Felix Culture\" where surely\nthe 16 sq. in. of film review\nif reduced to single spacing\ncould have gone?\nIn fact with a little rearrangement and the removal\nof the above we are left with\n4 sides of Felix (of which 7\narticles are double-spaced)\nplus Felix Diary \u2014 the most\nuseful part of the paper.\nSurely if Felix could be\nproduced with less pages it\nwould be more economical?\nI expect that with the return\nof Sports Page the paper will\nagain grow and all the bet-ter, but referring again to\nthis week, wouldn't we\nrather have quality than\nquantity of newsprint and\nhave a compact Felix rather\nthan one which appeared to\nbe trying hard to find makeshift articles?\nYours sincerely\nCATHY GEE\nThere' s more to life on a Kibbutz than picking Oranges.

The rest of society\n(including students) are not\ndirectly related to the means\nof production, so are neither\ncapitalists or workers. Students represent a transient\nsection of our society, most\nof whom will tomorrow obtain or expect to obtain the\n'plum' jobs in our society.\nMarxists argue (which history very much substantiates) that the motor of social\nchange is the balance of\nclass forces, i.e. the strength\nof organised labour against\nthe owners of the means of\nproduction.\nThe working class is the\nonly progressive class (the\nother class \u2014 the capitalists\n\u2014 cannot be, as no ruling\nclass in history has ever advocated fundamental social\nchange within its society so\nas to dispossess itself from\npower). In a real sense\nthere is no third class for, in\nthe last analysis, the middle\nclass (that unorganised section of privileged workers\nand small business men)\nare confined in the other two\nclasses.\nHence the above slogans\ncrystal lise these ideas with\nstudents should side with\nthe most progressive class in\nthe class struggle and at\nsame time to combat the\nmachinery of the state (the\nArmy, police force, prisons\nand places of coercion, etc.)\nwhich, under the pretence of\nworking in the interests of\nsociety at large, in the final\nanalysis defends the status\nquo and upholds the old\norder.\nIn the interests of brevity\nI will refrain from commenting on any other misconceptions in the article.\nJOCK ME ALL\nP.S. How are \"well-educated\ngentlemen like us\" going to\nobtain any substantial grant\nincrease by showing how\n\"reasonable\" we are?

    "content": "23rd JANUARY, 1973\nNEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nFREE! No. 325\nRETAINED BY POPULAR REQUEST\" P the J and FD\"\nIf you are an undergraduate, you\nare entitled to a grant of \u00a3480 a year.\nNext year this will be raised to \u00a3500.\nIf you are lucky enough to live in hall\nor student house, and your parents pay\nyou the full parental contribution, you\nare probably not all that badly off. The\n\"notional element\" in the grant for\nboard and lodgings is \u00a3275 in London( \u00a3240 elsewhere). Supposing that you\neat. che z Mooney three times a day,\nit probably only costs you in the region of \u00a3230 - \u00a3240 \u2014 including \u00a311 a year new halls levy.\nOnly 1,200 students live in hall or\nhouse. What about the other 2,800 of\nyou? Living in a digs with breakfast\nprovided costs, say, \u00a36.50 a week during term, and \u00a32 a week retainer during\nvacations. So between October and June\nyou pay \u00a3218 just for lodgings\u2014add\nMooney food (about the cheapest refectories in the University) and we arrive\nat a figure of roughly \u00a3330 \u2014 \u00a355 more\nthan allowed for in the grant.\nLive in a flat, and you can expect to\nbe lucky to pay \u00a36 a week right through\nvacations, too. That's \u00a3234 \u2014 \u00a3345\nwith food, and \u00a370 more than the notional element. This is equivalent to\na cut of one-third in the amount allowed for clothes, books, travel and\neverything else.\nThe current grant level was negotiated\nin 1971. This allowed for a rise in three stages: to \u00a3465 for 1971-72, \u00a3480\nfor 1972-73 and \u00a3500 in 1973-4. These\nfigures were based on previously experienced rates of inflation.\nA \"Student Cost Index\" has been\ncalculated \u2014 pretty much the same as\nthe ordinary cost index, but leaving out\nthinks like carpets and cookers and\nother things that don't affect us, and\nweighting everything that does correctly\n(more or less). According to this, the\nrise in costs in 1971-2 (academic year)\nwas 7.9%. The rise in grant was 2.9%.\nWhen the grant levels were changed\nin 1971, so was the floor of the parental\nmeans test scale. This had an interesting effect on the increases in the total\namount paid in grants by Local Education Authorities. Whereas their payments increased by 1 2 % , the total\nAction for Higher Grants\nNOW\nTen days ago Imperial College Union rejected a rent strike. Nevertheless, a substantial motion on grants was passed almost unanimously, and the union executive is still pushing for action. Posters based on this photograph and slogan are already going up in all USK colleges. TheN US is\norganising demonstrations and a\" Day of Action\". Well, we all know that every year, with monotonous regularity, the\npoliticians amongst us organise a Campaign. Last year is was over the\nautonomy issue. This year it's grants. But before you go off into a corner,\ncurl up, cover your face with FELIX and go to sleep over what might appear\nto be the inanity of it all, forget the \" action\" and examine the facts. A worthwhile exercise. I hope you' ll agree, since most of us rely solely on grants\nfor our livelihood during the academic year. No propaganda, promise: just\nfacts. Here they are.\nparental contributions increased by\n69% \u2014 or, at least, the amount that\nshould have been paid in parental contributions did.\nNot everyone is lucky enough to get\n\u00a3480 a year, even in the university sec-tor. If you're female and a student,\nand thinking of getting married, the\ngovernment's advice would seem to be\n\"don't\".At least, not unless your intended spouse is a student too. Because,\nif he isn't, you only qualify for \u00a3275 \u2014\nsubject to a means test on your parents.\nThat figure was fixed in 1965, and hasn't been raised since.\nOf course we in universities are\ngreatly privileged under the grants\nscheme, for there is a mandatory rate\nof grant.\nEvery undergraduate (not living at\nhome) at Imperial College is entitled\nto \u00a3480 (subject to parental contrib u tion), regardless of where he comes from\nor where he lives in London. This is\nnot the case for students in further (as\nopposed to higher) education \u2014 for\nexample, technical and art colleges.\nThese students are on discretionary\nawards. The discretion is that of the\nLocal Education Authority, and it is\ntheir decision how much (if any) grant\nis to be awarded. Since each LEA acts\ndifferently, geographical inequality also\noccurs.\nMost grant-receiving students are liable\nto parental contributions, as assessed by\na means test. It has been estimated\nthat only about 2 5 % of students qualifying for parental contributions receive\nthem in full. The average parental\ncontribution, leaving aside students on\nthe minimum award of \u00a350, is approximately \u00a390. Evidence suggests that\nstudents not obtaining the full parental\ncontribution receive on average some\n5 0 % of this figure in cash and kind.\nOnly students with parents having a \"residual income\" (after allowances) of\nless than \u00a31,100 get the full grant without deduction from their LEA, and they\npay \u00a31 for every \u00a310 they earn over this.\nAnd, of course, parents lose 10% of\nany pay rise they may get.\nThat is a thumb-nail sketch of the\ngrants situation. Grants have lost \u00a380 in\nvalue since 1971 in London.\nMarried women are very much the\npoor relations of their spinster counter-parts. And even they are better off\nthan students in F.E. colleges. Many students in all sectors are losing money\nthrough the parental means test.\nThe NUS, hardly surprisingly, has\nthus decided to mount a campaign to\nchange the situation.\nEXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING\nThursday 1300 hrs Great Hall - COME!\n\n"

    "content": "January 23rd,1973 FELIX FEE IX FIHANCIA\u00a3\u00a3Y How to lose money without really dying This week, FELIX FINANCIALLY departs from its\nnormal format. Since the inception of the page last\nterm, our financial adviser, DEREK E. CUMMINGS, insurance broker and iconoclast, has been asking\nsome pertinent questions on behalf of students who are thinking about the world beyond their finals, and\nalso making some fairly strong comments on the\nfinancial scene in general.\nNext week, however, he reverts to his original\nrole in Imperial College \u2014 that of a General Studies\nlecturer. On Wednesday, January 3 0 , he will be\ngiving the first of four lectures on financial subjects.\nSo now, FELIX is about to cross-examine Derek\nCummings about that lecture, which is to be entitled\n\" How to Lose Money without Really Dying.\" Well, the title is intriguing, so let's find out more.\nFELIX: What exactly is the title of next week's lecture\nmeant to mean?\nCUMMINGS: It means this. That unless you are careful about\nwhat kind of insurance policy you buy, you stand\nto waste a lot of money. If you examine the way most insurance companies operate, you will see\nthat most of the policies they sell to people wish ing to take out life assurance are endowment\npolicies \u2014 the sort where you pay premiums for\na fixed number of years and collect a lump sum at the end. If you die in the meantime, the company will, of course, pay out. But if you live, you\nwill find you are actually losing money on the\ndeal.\nFELIX: You're saying that insurance companies are con-men, then?\nCUMMINGS: I have said this before, and I 'll say it again.\nInsurance companies mislead the public into believing that endowment-type policies are best\nfor the public, when in fact they are merely best\nfor the insurance companies. These policies very\nskilfully entangle two factors concerning insurance \u2014 the protection factor and the savings fac-tor. When it comes to providing for your\ndependents in case of your death, insurance companies are very good. But if you live, and your\npolicy becomes an investment for later life or\nretirement, then endowment policies are diabolically un competitive. FELIX: If this is true, why have the insurance companies\nbeen so successful in misleading the public?\nCUMMINGS: Because insurance is an emotional business.\nEveryone needs insurance of some kind. But the\ninsurance companies spend fortunes on promoting only those kinds of policy which will be most\nprofitable to themselves.\nFELIX: You say we all need insurance of some kind? CUMMINGS: Yes. If you own a motor car, the law obliges you\nto have insurance. If you marry or have other\ndependents, it's a pretty unreasonable man who doesn't think to buy insurance as protection for\nthem in case of his death. In both cases, it's a matter of finding the best possible policy to fit\nthe circumstances. And endowment policies are\nnot it.\nFELIX: All right, but why do you say insurance companies give the public a bad deal on endowment\npolicies as a form of investment?\nCUMMINGS: Because the very best of the insurance companies\ntake something like fifteen years to double your\nmoney. But this country is currently taking only\neight to ten years to halve the purchasing power\nof the pound. On that scale, the insurance companies are on the best end of the deal by a very\nlong way.\nFELIX:\nHow do you substantiate that argument?\nCUMMINGS: An Economist survey dated 18th July1970 shows\nthat the top six insurance companies take about\nfifteen years to pay back double what a policyholder pays in premiums on an endowment policy. Meanwhile, a Central Statistical Office\nreport dated March1972 states categorically\nthat the pound is halving its real value in about\n8 or 9 years.\nFELIX:\nAre you saying that any insurance is a waste of\ntime and a potential waste of money? CUMMINGS: Let me put it this way. If you have no financial\nobligations, forget all about insurance. On the\nother hand, it is my firm opinion that young\npeople should do all they can to save vigorously for some objective, which may be a long\nway short of retirement. Buying a house, for\nexample. As for life assurance, it's fine and very\nuseful \u2014 providing there is a need for protection.\nFELIX:\nWell, yes, I suppose we all agree in principle\nthat saving for the future is a good thing. What would you suggest as the best form it should\ntake?\nCUMMINGS: Put your money into a building society. It costs\nonly a couple of quid to open an account, and you get interest on it. Furthermore, it puts you, as\nan investor, at the top of the list when it comes\nto getting a mortgage \u2014 and that's something you will be very likely to want in the future. Just com pare the two methods of saving for a moment.\nInsurance companies take your valuable pounds\ntoday and your gradually less valuable pounds\nover, say, the next fifteen years. At the end of\nthe period, they'll maybe pay you back double\nthe paper value \u2014 but in very much devalued\ncurrency. With house purchase, you reverse the\nprocess. You borrow somebody' s valuable pounds\ntoday and repay them with devaluing money. At the same time, you're buying a commodity which is always increasing in real value. Furthermore,\nthat increasing value is more than enough to offset the interest you pay for your borrowing.\nThere's no question about which is the best value.\nFELIX:\nBut what about the protection factor in in sur ance? What advice would you give about that?\nCUMMINGS: Spend as little as possible to achieve the maxim um possible cover. It can be done cheaply. I know it can, and every insurance company in the\nland knows it can. But there is a world of differ-en ce \u2014 not to mention profit\u2014between knowing\nabout it and telling you about it. Why should they\ntell you? They're on to too good a thing with the\nold endowment policy. No, they won't tell you unless you press them very hard \u2014 and neither,\nfor that matter will most insurance brokers.\nFELIX:\nBut you are an insurance broker. Aren't you condemning your own profession?\nCUMMINGS: Yes, Iam. One cannot really quarrel with the\ninsurance companies if they spend most of their\ntime putting forward the best possible proposition for themselves. But brokers are supposed to\nbe unbiased in putting the interests of their clients\nfirst. But Iam afraid that is not often the case.\nMost take the easy way out. It's in their interest\nto sell you the type of policy the insurance companies want to sell, since the broker's com mis Page 3\nsion is a percentage of the premium paid. The more you pay, the more the broker gets.\nFELIX:\nSo how do you justify your own position?\nCUMMINGS: Because I take a rather different view of the job\nIam doing. I think my company' s long-term\ninterests are best served by giving the best possible service and thereby gaining our clients' respect and trust. Certainly, I could talk a client\ninto taking out a policy which would bring in a fat commission, but that outlook is, in my view,\na short-sighted one. I gain more by taking the trouble to think about a client's real interests,\nboth at the present and in the future. I would hope, for example, that what I have said here\nwould make any student stop and think for a moment before he runs out and buys insurance.\nBut I think I have said enough for the moment.\nI have a whole lot more to say at my General\nStudies lecture next week and I shall be more\nthan happy to answer any other questions at that\ntime.\nobsessed with the number of pages it carried in1972, claiming about 2 0 0 0 more than the previous\nyear. Well, that really clinches it for me. What a great paper. Must just dash out and waste 3 pence.\nAnd in the first three days of 1 9 7 3 , it continued,\nwe have already had36 more pages than in the corresponding three days of 1 9 7 2 .

But just as I was about to\nhand over my3 pI remembered that January 1 st was a Sunday last year and the Evening papers\nmercifully don't come out on the Sabbath . . .

This consists of a series of tests\non Army Land, some involving climbing as far as\npossible up a steep dirt hill, whilst others involve short\ntimed tests around plastic pylons. The accent with this\ntype of event is on fun, but there will be serious\ncompetition especially from members of other clubs.\nAny type of car is suitable for this sort of event:\u2014\nthere are classes for most types of car. Your ordinary\nroad car is all you need. Entry fee is \u00a31 (to club\nmembers). Spectators, are of course, very welcome.\nThe event will be held at Normandy Hill, Ash, which\nis near Aldershot.

Our first three matches this term were also in Richmond Park. In the first we took on Sandhurst and\nVets, and lost scoring 33 points to Sandhurst's14 and\nVets' 32. Rob Parker did 28m.35s. and Kaliray 34m.26s. Then we soundly beat LSE54 to 90 (counting 8)\nby finishing the first two, Rob Parker and Joe Keating together in 28m.56s., and by packing in 10th \u2014\n14th. Last Wednesday, with a team robbed of its\nstrength by the injury to Rob Parker, we easily beat\na combined London Hospital-Kings team but lost\nsomewhat to the Met. Police who had five in the first\nsix. Allison was 4th in 30m.30s. and Dave Payne\n(31m.50s.), Steve Webb (31m.54s.), Neil Boag (32m.15s.) and Pad Donnelly (36m.40s.) all got personal\nbests. For his services to handicapping, and to the\nFlour Industry, Rob Parker was dubbed \" 2 7 th\" and\ngiven the honorary time of 44m.55s. Noticeable at these matches were three frozen scorers,\nJim Bathurst, Hugh Culverhouse and lan Isherwood\nand ce retain runners not so far mentioned: Pete Johnson, Rob Maddison, Andrew Baxter, Stuart Littlewood,\nand of course(!)

Straight\nfrom the face-off the midfield powered in. The determination of all in the\nteam was evident, partial Early of Lionel Clarke who\noccasionally emerged with\nthe ball from almost im possible situations. The\nattack ably drew out Hill croft's defence leaving a few gaps which Whizz Kid Spooner was always grateful to utilize and, slipping\npast his opposite number,\nblasted in five goals in the first quarter.\nHillcroft showed that\nthey were not to be easily\ndismissed by replying with\ntwo goals in the first half.\nTwo goals by Tony Hallett, the first from an amazing angle, and three\nmore from Whizz Kid,( but the less said about\nthat the better or he won't be able to get his helmet\non next week!) showed\nthat the game was all I.C.'s. Now Hillcroft resorted to bodily attack, laying out Pete Drury by a vicious swipe at his ank-les. However, Pete was soon hopping about, after\nhe had been deposited in a nearby icy pond for\nsome improvised treat-ment.\nThroughout the game\nthe defence had been exceptional with some good\ntackling and tight mark-ing. Bob Strange way and\nSam Henry playing as\nwell as ever. Only nearer\nthe end when the defence\nbegan to slacken did the\nopposition manage to\ncome back with two more\ngoals. The final score:\u2014\nImperial 10, Hillcroft 4.\nAll this was managed\nwith two last minute 'vol-un te ers', Pete McDonald and Graham Clarke who,\ndespite having not played\nbefore, soon settled into\nthe game remarkably\nwell. This shows that anyone wanting to take up a good, fast game with a successful team should\nconsider lacrosse (what a subtle plug!!).\nRow Flares\nOver Room\nCharges\nSocial Clubs Committee is heading for a major confrontation with college administration over hire charge for rooms used for SCC\nclub's meetings.\nThe row flared when Mr. Victor Mooney, college\ncatering manager, asked for a \u00a350 fee for the use of\nthe Senior Common Room, Southside, for a Chinese\nNew Year Dinner, due to be held on February 9th.

Thus he stands a fair chance of having written something\ninteresting. I like Bob Dylan \u2014 on rec-ord, but even so this book makes a brave\nattempt to put some real thoughts into\nthose magically candid photographs on\nL.P. covers. It tries to show where those\nmagical words from \"Tonight I 'll be\nstaying here with you\" come from \u2014\n\" Throw my ticket out the window,\nThrow my suitcase out there too,\nThrow my troubles out the door,\nI don't need them any more,\n'Cause tonight I 'll be staying here\nwith you.\" Mr. Gray tries very successfully to\nshow where this magnificent performer\ngets his energy, his dynamism and,\nabove all, his poetry from. T think he\nmanages to hold the reader's attention\nby carefully interposing snatches of\nsong between his statements, by calling\non the comments of others and by\ncharting Dylan's evolution from his very\nbeginning to the mass media product he\nhas become. The book shows the influence people like Holly, Presley, Ritchie\nValens and most important of all the\natmosphere of Nashville had on Bob\nDylan.\nIt is sometimes quite easy to lose the\nlyrics in a song sung by Dylan, but when\nthey are before you on the page there\nis no mistaking the simplicity and\nbeauty.\n\" All the tired heroes\" is an excellent\nexample\u2014a no voice Dylan and an\nultra-simple lyric leaves us with a three-line song:\n' All the tired horse on the sun\nHow' mIs 'posed to get any riding\ndone?\nMm \u2014 mm \u2014 mm \u2014 mm...' The book is really finished off with\nfull details of all Dylan's work and a complete catalogue of his albums\u2014\nincluding bootleg ones.\nDAVID HOB MAN CLOCKWORK ORANGE\" Brilliant\", Kubrick at his best\", \" A Masterpiece\" screamed all the critics\nhere and in New York, hustling and\njostling each other fo or superlatives, all,\nthat is, except the film critic of the\n\"Village Voice\" who with great perception and critical analysis drew our\nattention to the only aspect of filmmaking in which one can say Kubrick is brilliant \u2014 Kubrick the technician.\nIn such a capacity Kubrick merits every\naccolade so far accorded to him, witness\nthe mind-blowing sets and scenes in\n\" 2 0 0 1 \" which he also directed. Likewise\n\" Clockwork Orange\" is a treat to the\neye, for Kubrick has the ability and\nimagination, coupled with capacity for\nphysical detail, that makes the infrastructure of the futuristic films he has\nmade a perfect extrapolation of present\nday trends.\nOn the surface \" Clockwork Orange\"\nis the tale (based on the book by Anthony Burgess) of the leader of a bunch\nof \"super-skinheads\", set ten, maybe\ntwenty years in the future, grotesque\nin their white trousers and shirts with\nbloodied eyeballs sewn to the cuffs and\nhuge fibreglass jock-straps worn outside their jeans, they indulge in \"ultra-violence\" with the passive, the weak and\nthe frightened. Speaking in a slang developed mainly from Russian words they\nbeat upon old dos ser and a rival gang\n\"indulging in a bit of the old in-outs\",\nbefore the leader played by Malcolm McDowell( who was also in \"IF\") retires home for the evening of listening\nto his beloved Beethoven.\nOne day, however, McDowell, looking\nfor ultra-violence in a break-in of the\n\"cat-women's\" house (an ageing leo tar ded cat-lover) hits her over the head\nwith an enormous plaster penis and kills\nher accidentally. Caught and sentenced\nto prison, he becomes an angelic prisoner as the only way to get out, mean-while, the government is looking for\nvolunteers for its new cure for criminals\nand McDowell agrees to this treatment,\nwhich is based on the axiom that too\nmuch of a good thing starts to pall. He is forced to watch endless scenes of rape\nand violence with background music of\nBeethoven's9 th until he is physically\nnauseated by any thought of his previous hobbies.\nHe is then released and rejected from\nhis home, (his parents let his room and\ncan't throw the new lodger out just\n'cos he comes back unexpectedly), he\nroams the streets of London, a tearful\nfigure of pathos, not understanding why\nhe is ostr aci sed for committing crimes\nwhich, as far as his new personality\ngoes, were committed by another per-son.\nHe ends up in the house of an author\nhe once crippled by kicking his stomach\nin while dancing to \"Singing in the\nRain\". During an orgy of \"ultra-vio-len ce\" he is locked in a room with the\n9th at full volume and feeling nauseous\nto the point of suicide he jumps from\nthe 2nd storey window and arrives in\nhospital to be congratulated and spoon-fed by the prime-minister, obsequiously\ngrovelling to the television cameras, on\nthe success of the cure and his return to\n\"normality\".\nIt is in the seemingly schizophrenic\ncombination of opposites that this film\nhas its main impact \u2014 the ultra-violence\nand Beethoven, the nice young man and\nthe pathological case in our body, the\nsickness and sadism of the scene of the\ncrippling of the author coupled with the\nlighthearted humour of kicking him in\ntime to singing \"Singing in the Rain\" which made almost all the audience\nlaugh.\nNo, it is in dealing with people and\nsociety that Kubrick is a non-starter;\nin \" 2 0 0 1 \" the characters were in a completely changed environment and yet\ntheir society was identical with the present one, he had made no predictions\nand answered no questions, indeed not\neven asked any, about the form of society in 2001. Although he has attempted\nto show possible present trends in Clockwork Orange, it is on a vague and\nconfused basis that he has done so,\nand all the (albeit little) satire in Burgess' book has been lost.\nOne is left with a feeling of exploit a tion, of lack of fulfilment after this\nfilm, for it is all too obviously just\nanother money-winner of the giant film\nindustry with its sex, violence, and hints\nof seat a logical humour. But what answer can one give to the man who, coming out of the cinema after seeing Clockwork Orange, while I was queueing to\ngo in, said to me \" Man, if you don't appreciate that film, you sure don't appreciate Art\". ALAS D HAIR CAMPBELL. The best reason for going to see Peter\nUstinov's\" The Unknown Soldier and\nhis Wife\"( New London Theatre) is to\nsee the theatre in which it resides, for\nthe New London Theatre is the first new\nWest End theatre for about thirty\nyears. It really is a very impressive\nbuilding, with a fine curved auditorium,\na very adaptable stage (thanks to Sean\nKenny), comfortable bars, an escalator,\na restaurant, car park, shop space and\ncouncil flats all included.\nInevitably the first production in such\nsurroundings is slightly disappointing\u2014\nas were the first productions of the\nNational Theatre, the Shaw and the\nYoung Vic in their time. Perhaps the\ncause lies in the mutual nervousness of\nthe cast and the audience. The play is a series of episodes in the history of war-fare, with similar characters appearing\nin each episode\u2014the two antagonists,\nthe Unknown Soldier, his wife, the\nArchbishop (Peter Ustinov complete,\ninitially, with UL U scarf), the soldiers,\nOld Uncle Tom Cobley and all. Each\ntime the Unknown Soldier gets called\nup, leaving his pregnant wife, and gets\nkilled in turn fighting for the Romans,\nthe Crusaders, the Puritans, the French\naristocracy, and the Somme.\nThe problem with the play is that it\nfalls fatally between the stools of good\nhumour and pathos, for dialogue like\n\"I saw .you last at Colossus, didn'tI?\" \"Yes, I think so\" said with grave severity fits badly with some of the superb\ncomedy created by, for instance, the\nperennial Inventor who, with the Arch bishop, always comes through the conflict on top. There is so much that is\ngood, that the flaws are dreadfully\nhighlighted, and the actors playing the\nUnknown Soldier and his Wife are seen\nto be colourless and pallid beside the\nother characters.\nMuch of the play is funny, and the\nintended, and rather facile, dramatic\npoints are trotted out well enough.\u2014\nthe Church changing its position as the\nwind blows, the paradox of the chivalry\nbetween leaders against the cruelty of\nthe war itself, the change less nature of\nwarfare with its unthinking soldier y. These points emerge, but there is none\nof the humorous strength of \" Oh! What\na Lovely War\", nor the convicting\nsavagery of Brecht or Brook's\"US\". The play is just a rather pale image of\nwhat it might have been.\nIn fact, it's just the sort of play to\nopen a new West End theatre. Come\nback Peter Brook, loan Littlewood,\nBertholt Brecht\u2014all is forgiven.\nBOB CARTER Island of the Mighty\nLike Long Day's Journey into Night;\nthis play is 3} hours long; however,\nIsland of the Mighty is weak, seemingly incoherent, and deadly dull.\nThe subject of much controversy,\nwhat with the Irish authors (Alden\nand D 'Arcy) objecting to the set, pro-duct ion, music and all \u2014 I came away\nwith the view that, were I the author,\nI'd dissociate myself from the play,\ntoo!\nSet on an essentially bare stage, the\nlegend of King Arthur is (supposedly)\ngiven new dimensions. Arthur is an old,\ndecrepit cripple left by Rome to fend\noff invading English. He has a rag-tag\npseudo-Roman legion, but spends more\ntime coping with wild, marauding British bands than fighting English. A great\ndeal of the play's time is, in fact, taken\nup by Wildcat Worshippers; only at the\nend does this make sense, and then only\nlittle. Merlin, here a poet, spends his\ntime cavorting with fellow sages; his end\nis strange. But then, I consider the whole\nplay strange.\nThe three acts are of almost equal\n70 minute length. After the first, I was\ntotally bewildered, sensing no direction\nto the action. The second seemed unrelated to the previous; only in the last\nact is it tied, however loosely, together.\nThe action, or lack thereof, set a new\nlow water mark, in my opinion, for\nthe Royal Shakespeare Company. They\ntried gallantly, in an excellent attempt\nto bring life into the corpse. They failed\nappallingly.\nAmong Ms. D 'Arsy's many criticisms\nwas the music. I found the unusual score\ninteresting and refreshing; it alone livened the dead play enough to keep me\nfrom walking out of the old, cold,\ndraught y Aldwych Theatre along with\na hundred or so others.\nIf you sympathize with the author's fight, you will want to boycott this play;\nif you want to see a good play, you will\nwant to miss this. In either case,\navoid it.\n\n"
