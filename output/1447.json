It\u2019s finally December, I can\u2019t believe\nhow excited I got when I\nopened the first window\non my advent calendar-ooo! A cracker! How excellent!\nSo what does December mean to us\nartsy type people? Well to me it means\na busy timetable of rehearsals leading\nto two days of sheer tiredness-based\nhell performing and coproducing the\nMusical Theatre Society\u2019s revue: Nicest Kids in Town.\nBut I\u2019m by no means the only one\nputting myself through a life of living\noff Red Bull and coffee in the name of\nart. Take a look at any of the myriad\nof posters around college (or anyone\nwho falls asleep in your lecture). You\nmay find a hidden gem or a new hobby\nout of it! If you do see any of the magnificent talent at Imperial do send us a\nreview! I may even give you a cookie.\nDecember also means the start of\npanto season. My parents were always\nsceptical about taking my sisters and\nI to pantomimes when we were little\nfor two reasons. 1) Pantos are bloody\nexpensive; it\u2019s the one time of the year\ntheatres can guarantee an audience\nand can hence charge what they bloody\nwell like. 2) I think my parents realised\nthat even at that young age I thought\npantos were a bit crude and tacky.\nI have exactly two memories of pan-tomines, generally because I have seen\ntwo pantomines. The first was being\nshit scared of King Rat in Dick Whittington- wouldn\u2019t you be scared of a\n6ft rat trying to eat your pet? This may\nhave had something to do with my fascination with Basil the Great Mouse\nDetective at the time.\nThe second panto I saw was Aladdin starring Barbara Windsor who\nI thought was a supermegastar. My\ngreatest memory from this was of her\nsinging \u2018Could It Be Magic\u2019 and me\nthen trying to copy it in my living room\nfor the rest of the holidays thus driving\nmy parents crazy.\nThis Christmas there will be none of\nthat panto type nonsense. Instead I will\nbe settling down to David Tennant in\nHamlet and then quickly switch over\nto Doctor Who to see him fight his final battle. How cheery. Hang on, Doctor Who is art isn\u2019t it? Guys? Hello?\nOooh! Spooky Stuff!\nRhys Davies discovers The Woman in Black, the timeless thriller\nMusical Theatre Weekly: South Pacific\nMusical Theatre Weekly has returned. For felix\u2019s anniversary Lucy Harrold celebrates the hot show of 1949\nThis is the reason girls really like musicals- fit men with their tops off, mmm....\nI\n\u2019m afraid it was slim pickings\nfor the world of theatre in\n1949, possibly because many\nperfectly good shows were already showing and we can just\nhide this year under the carpet as an\n\u201coff year\u201d.\nHistory\nSouth Pacific derived from a series\nof short stories by James A Michener\nunder the name of \u201cTales of The South\nPacific\u201d. Joshua Logan, a director and\nveteran of World War Two, decided\nthat he wanted to adapt these babies\nand so approached Richard Rodgers\nand Oscar Hammerstein, writers of\nsuch shows as the Sound of Music and\nCarousel, to do so. The production\nwon ten Tony awards and went on to\nwin the 1950 Pulitzer Prize for drama\n(so far only one musical a decade has\nwon this accolade). The show went on\nto be made into a movie and is considered one of the seminal Rodgers and\nHammerstein pieces.\nAt the time, South Pacific was seen\nas a brave new piece embracing an\nend to racism, but in hindsight it was\nprobably more racially blinkered than\nanything.\nPlot\nOn a small South Pacific island during World War Two, Nellie Forbush, a\nNavy Nurse, has fallen in love with a\nFrench plantation owner named Emile.\nShe discovers he already has two children by a native woman (insert racist\nsubplot) and realises she cannot go out\nwith a guy who likes \u201cnatives\u201d (she\u2019s\nfrom Arkansas and it\u2019s the forties, what\nneed I say?) Meanwhile, Lieutenant\nCable has arrived on the island as a spy\nand is preyed upon by Bloody Mary: a\nlarge, ugly woman, and the only non-Navy woman on the island.\nWe then discover that her daughter,\nLiat, is also on the island whom she\ngoes about setting up with Cable. Unfortunately Cable is also a typically racist guy although we discover that both\nhe and Nellie have been brought up\nthat way and (supposedly) \u201ccan\u2019t help\nit\u201d.\nEmile challenges the pair\u2019s racist tendencies and Cable realises that he does\nstill love Liat. I won\u2019t give the ending\naway but use your imagination- it\u2019s set\nin the South Pacific and it\u2019s wartime.\nSomeone\u2019s going to die.\nMain Characters:\nNellie Forbush: Sweet, naive Navy\nensign from Arkansas.\nEmile DeBecque: A wordly, older\nFrench plantation owner who seems\nto be the only non-racist character in\nthe show\nJoe Cable: Attractive young Navy spy\nwho is hanging around the island until\nhe can start his mission\nBloody Mary: Fat, ugly native grass-skirt seller who still manages to get all\nthe sailors\u2019 attentions.\nLiat: Bloody Mary\u2019s young, attractive\ndaughter who falls in love with Cable.\nCome on, you know something\u2019s going\nto go wrong.\nSongs to look out for:\nI\u2019m Gonna Wash That Man Right\nOutta My Hair: Cute song sung by\nNellie. Men pay attention: it is usually\nsung by scantily clad, attractive young\nwomen.\nSome Enchanted Evening: Possibly\nthe most famous song from the showa booming ballad. Very lyrical, very\nnice.\nYounger Than Springtime: I see this\nas basically a bouncier, less solemn\nversion of Some Enchanted Evening\nand hence, like it more.\nMy head of department suggested I\nadded Happy Talk to this list but I still\ncan\u2019t get over that awful remix by Dizzee Rascal.\nWhere can I can get it?\nWell the DVD definitely still exists,\nin fact there are a few versions. There\nare recordings aplenty and if you have\nlots of money or daddy\u2019s credit card\nthen go to Broadway and see the Lincoln Centre revival. It won the Tony\naward for best revival and is even considered better than the original. The\npicture above is from that production\nincluding the very delicious Matthew\nMorrison and his oh so beefy biceps.\nIf you liked this, try:\nThe Sound of Music- Well, you\u2019ve\nprobably tried this before South Pacific but it is possibly Rodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s most famous show.\nOn The Town- More sailors!! This\ntime they\u2019re in New York but there are\nstill links back to the war and the sadness it brings.\nFinians Rainbow- Another golden\noldie but also another show about rac-ism. This was definitely ahead of its\ntime, a place where bigoted old townsfolk are changed race by a magical\nleprechaun.\nI\nt\u2019s Friday night and I have an\nold friend to entertain. What\nam I to do?\nWell, it\u2019s London so we decide\nto take in a show. But which\nshow? The choice is practically sti-fling. However, after a personal rec-ommendation, we finally decide on\nThe Woman in Black at the Fortune\nTheatre, just off Covent Garden.\nThe plot, adapted from a Susan Hill\nnovel by Stephen Mallatratt, sees a\nyoung London solicitor head north to\na dour estate to settle a recently deceased client\u2019s affairs. While there, he\ncatches glimpses of the mysteriously\nethereal woman in black. When he\nquestions the locals about her identity,\nthey behave strangely and refuse to\ntalk to him. Thus, he is on his own as\nher character and purpose are slowly\nrevealed to him.\nThis may sound like a pretty pedestrian ghost story and I suppose it is\nbut there are many aspects of the play\nwhich elevate not only the standard\nbut the fear also. Firstly, the play is\ntold as the solicitor, now an old man,\nrehearses the story with a stage actor\nso he can explain it to his family. Thus,\nit becomes a story within a story. It is\nespecially effective when the recorded\nsound and props used to create mood\nand setting are overtly recognised as\nsuch. What\u2019s more, during the rehearsal (the real story) the actor plays the\npart of the solicitor while the solicitor\nplays the rest of the cast. Far from a\ndistraction, it is innovative and a great\ncredit to the actors\u2019 plasticity.\nBut what truly impressed and terrified me in equal measure was the use\nof sound and light in the play. The\nstage itself is sparse, with the few props\nconstantly given new interpretations\nwith every changing scene. With nothing gaudy to distract the audience, the\nother senses are given free reign.\nEvery creaking floorboard, every\ncrow\u2019s caw is used to instil a sense of\nanxiety in the audience. If you can hear\nsomething in the play, you\u2019re meant\nto hear it and it\u2019s meant to worry you.\nLight is used even better, despite its infidelity to the young solicitor. Electrics\nfail, torches give out, lamps splutter\nand suddenly the stage is plunged into\ndarkness. But this isn\u2019t an empty dark-ness, there\u2019s something in this night\nand it\u2019s none too nice. And when the\nlights come back, that isn\u2019t necessarily good, as they illuminate something\nwhich should have definitely remained\nhidden.\nIn essence, where this play truly succeeds is not in what it shows you but\nin what it doesn\u2019t show you. With a\nminimal cast, limited (but creative)\nuse of props, silence and darkness,\nthe play leaves your imagination to fill\nin the gaps. It doesn\u2019t say that there\u2019s\nsomething in the blackness but you instinctively know that there is and your\nheart begins to pound. Then, the play\njolts forward, reveals the eponymous\nwoman in black \u2013 and you scream.\nWell, I did, at least. In summary, you\nshould make an effort to see this play\nnot only for a ghost story well told but\nfor the technical genius behind the\nnarrative as well.\nShe\u2019s behind you! Sorry, wrong article\n\n"

To\nbegin with, you have\nto wonder what somebody has to do to their\nroom to offend the\nWarden to the extent\nthat he throws you out.\nMoreover, building a\nreputation for \u201cwrecking your room\u201d makes\nit look like that they\nkept fixing it, only for\nCarl Burgess to trash\nit again, like some old\ncartoon gag.\nAdd into the mix the\nfact that we\u2019re talking\nabout the President of\nthe Union and this story is heading towards\nthe bizarre. Better still,\nit\u2019s not clear whether\nthe felix Editor at the\ntime had a sense of humour and used an em-barassing photo of Carl\nBurgess or whether our\nPresident in 1984 was a\nstark raving lunatic.\nEither way, the idea\nthat his room was so\nhorrifying that the\ncleaners wore masks is\nhilarious. Ashley, you\nstill have 6 months. Go\non, shave your head\nand trash your room!\nAshley Brown: \u2018Generally quite nice.\u2019\nHave you ever felt that\nit would be impossible\nfor the Union to get big\nname acts? And sure,\neven if the Union could\nattract some interesting bands, we\u2019d never\nbe able to afford it.\nWell take hope from\nthis great photo from\n1967. The Union used\nto put on something\ncalled Carnival which\nI assume was something like the Summer\nBall. In that year, the\norganiser Jerry Stockbridge got none other\nthan the legendary Jimi\nHendrix as the Carnival finale. Beats Athlete, right?\nIf that hasn\u2019t already\nput recent organisers\nof the Summer Ball to\nshame, Jerry Stockbridge also managed to\nturn a profit of \u00a33,500\n(that\u2019s around \u00a350,000\ntoday using retail price\nindex for inflation).\nYou would imagine\nthat after achieving a\nrecord 50% increase in\nprofit, Mr Stockbridge\nwould relax and think\n\u201cJob Done\u201d. No he told\nthe then Editor R. J\nRedmayne, \u201cThe job\nat Carnival each year\nmust be to surpass the\nprevious year\u2019s profit.\u201d\nMmm, doesn\u2019t sound\nlike he\u2019d be much fun\non the weekend.\nAdmittedly, it\u2019s annoying when you pick\nup felix and discover a\nspelling, grammar or\npunctuation error (be-lieve me, it\u2019s more annoying for us).\nWhenever I see an\napostrophe that\u2019s gone\nastray, I take comfort\nin remembering that\nDan Wan (pictured\nright) isn\u2019t the first Editor that\u2019s received flak\nfor errors in the paper.\nIn 1983, Pallab\nGhosh (now a successful science journalist)\nwas felix Editor and\ngiven the nature of\nhis end of year \u2018award\u2019,\nprobably had a hard-time of it.\nI suspect that we\u2019ll\nnever quite know what\n\u2018things in general\u2019 he\ndisregarded but given\nhis following career\nsuccess, I imagine that\nthe lessons he learnt as\nfelix Editor have stuck\nwith him ever since.\n60 years of\nserious headlines\nAmericans weren\u2019t welcome even in 1989\nWhen you go into\nthe examination hall,\nyou obviously have a\nlot weighing on your\nmind. The last thing\nyou\u2019d expect is that after slogging through 3\nhours of Chemical Engineering, you\u2019ll stroll\nover to your dad\u2019s car\nwhich you borrowed\nfor the day and discover it to be missing.\nThis article from\n1958 would have been\nnewsworthy if that had\nbeen the entire story\nbut as it happens the\ncar was used in a violent robbery two days\nlater in Derby.\nIn 2007, another student also found that\nthe area around Imperial College isn\u2019t always\nas safe as you might\nimagine. The Photosoc\nmember was held up at\ngunpoint on Cromwell\nRoad in the middle of\nthe afternoon and had\nover \u00a3300 of photography equipment stolen.\nThe unlucky student\nwas kind enough to\nprovide a handy sketch\nof the muggers for the\narticle (right).

    "content": "2 felix FRIDAY 09 DECEMBER 1949\nThe need has been felt for some time for a frequently published journal to comment upon the affairs of the College whilst they are still topical, and to\nbring to the attention of its members the activities of Clubs and Societies of which people at present know little, and knowing little, tend to care even less.\nThis is a function which clearly cannot be performed by THE PHOENIX, particularly since that estimable bird is now to appear only twice a year, and so FELIX has\ncome to meet the need. We do not intend to encroach upon the literary field covered by THE PHOENIX; rather do we intend to be complementary to that journal, even\nif not always complimentary. Neither are we in any way connected with it, nor are we its offspring. (In any case, this unfortunate bird is presumably unable to\nproduce any offspring, since only one bird exists at any one time, rising from the ashes of its predecessor. Perhaps this accounts for its doleful appearance).\nNo, THE PHOENIX will remain an essentially literary magazine, whereas we shall content ourselves with providing a commentary upon events and personalities.\nThe success or failure of this paper depends principally upon you, our readers. In the first place we depend upon you to produce many of our articles\nand reports, since our staff cannot themselves attend and report every College event. Secondly we depend upon you to maintain a lively correspondence in our\ncolumns. Here is an opportunity for you to air your opinions, ideas and grievances to the whole College instead of just to those within earshot at the bar,\nand replies can be published before everyone has forgotten what the original letter was about. Thirdly we depend upon you(to buy your own copy of FELIX, and\nnot just to read somebody else\u2019s copy. We do not think that 3d is beyond the financial scope even of a student trying to live on a F.E.T. grant, and copies for a\nterm cost less than a pint of beer.\nAny profits made by the paper are to be devoted to Sports Day, since it appears that the Union is now so impecunious that it may be unable to subsidise\ncoaches and teas on that important occasion.\nAny contribution will be welcomed, whether it be a full article on the marital customs of the Watussi or a chance remark heard in the bar. Contributions\nand letters should be addressed to:- The Editor, Imperial College Union, Prince Consort Road. Contributors may write under nems de plume if they wish, but must\nsupply their names and Colleges with their contributions.\nA debt of gratitude is owed to F.C.EWELS for his suggestion of a title. He shall be rewarded with a saucer of milk.\nWe note with pleasure that Dinner in Hall is steadily gaining support as a regular College function. We learn that 40 Dutch students are attending next\nTuesday\u2019s dinner. If every member of the College makes a point of attending this function at least once a term, its success will be assured.\nCelebration with Repercussions.\nFor centuries men, women and children, connected in the smallest way with this\ncountry, have taken it to be their joyous and inalienable right to rend the silence and\nblackness of the November night, for one night only, with loud explosions and vivid flames\nand fireworks.\nThe men, women and children of this College differ little from their predecessors in\nthis respect, and on November 5th 1949, many hundred students with escort emerged from the\nmerrymaking at the \u201cHop\u201d to gambol and caper, - indeed to celebrate in the way that Guy\nFawkes so unwittingly initiated. Know this, friends; these merry-makers were indeed worthy\nof that title. The appellations of organised trouble-makers or hooligans ring as untrue\nas apologies in the ear of one who has been crippled in the Scrum. Imagine, therefore, the\nconsternation among these revellers at being greeted in the shadow of the Albert Hall by\nour blue-coated brothers in inflamed mood. Report after report was passed around of he\nwho had been punched in the kidneys, she who was pushed in the face, and others worsely\nhandled.\nThis treatment, one may conjecture, was designed to quell any merrymaking and\nfireworking, and in fact force a hasty retreat by all to the Union. The design was bad; there\nare probably few other bodies in the British community who value their freedom and their\nrights as much as Students. The rough behaviour of the Law aroused indignation, but apart\nfrom urgent expostulation, no departure was made from the practice of Bonfire lighting, the\ncreation of Mighty Explosions and the indescribable whirl and turmoil attendant upon the\nFestival Spirit. Indeed 4 students (one at least of whom comes from The Bush) were defying\nthe flames and flying fireworks in a dance of delight round the fire. Meanwhile The Prince\nConsort looked down benignly, and reassured himself, we are sure, by telling himself of the\nsafety of the structure around his head.\nOthers seemed to disagree, albeit reverently, with the measured opinion of the Prince\nand more blue helmets were seen to bob their way (usually accompanied by a constable)\ntowards the fire - harmless as it was. In an instant there was a spurt of water; a loud\nhissing and an uprising of angry steam marked the dousing of the friendly flames. But,\nfriends, this was not all. The jet of water having done its deed was then directed on to\nthose who hitherto, had been enjoying the pleasing warmth and happiness exuding from the\nfire. Only one outcome could there be; students bore down upon the unpleasant hose in an\nattempt to maintain the dryness of their clothing. The further outcome was unexpected, for\nin an instant some of our numbers were linking arms with policemen and walking in some\nhaste towards the mobile police vans.\nIt became evident that strong measures were being taken by the Law to discontinue\nthe customary celebration; and even more so when student after student was flung into\na black van and removed to custody. It was an uneven contest, for the umpire was not on\nour side. However, the student body is not one to say goodbye before the final whistle, and\ntheir attentions having been distracted from the Albert Memorial Steps (oh, bad strategy,\nsir!) some students were seen to have difficulty in crossing the road towards the Hall\nwithout lifting a vehicle or two out of the way. Finally, conscious of the fact that the best\nactivities should not continue after the climax, cries of \u201cCome on I.C.\u201d and the chanting of\nthe I.C.Boomalaka brought an enjoyable - but disappointing - evening to a close.-- For some, but others, languishing in Chelsea Police Station, were not wholly\nappreciative of the humour of the occasion. These 16 unfortunates appeared before the\nBeak on the Monday, to be remanded for a fortnight, since this was considered to be no\nmere display of \u201cthe exuberance of youth\u201d but a serious incident. In the interim police\nhelmets were sought among the student body with little success; many hearts, however, were\ngladdened by the apparition on The Houses of Parliament of a similar object. Far be it from\nme to speak sub judice regarding those yet to be tried. However, let us wish them god speed\nin returning to us from the Court and, moreover, let us dig deep in our pockets to help pay\ntheir fines.\nTAURUS.\nTHE ESCAPADES OF BOANERGES IN THE LONDON-BRIGHTON RALLY,\nNOVEMBER 13TH.\nThe weather forecast on the Saturday evening was not\nvery promising, cold with scattered showers. It was only to\nbe hoped that the showers would not scatter themselves on\nthe London-Brighton road. It meant an early start for all\nconcerned and the very sleepy crew of \u201cBoanerges\u201d rolled up\nat the College at 7.15 a.m.\nIn the greyness of the morning \u201cBo\u201d certainly looked\nrather dispassionate but after the addition of a few gallons\nof the essentials the old boy seemed a little more perky. At\nlast after innumerable adjustments had been made to the too\nnumerous controls Bo arrived in fine time at the \u201cMagazine\u201d\nin Hyde Park, where the noise and smoke seemed to grow in\nvolume as did the spirits of the crews of \u201cBo and the tender\u201d.\nThe \u201cGuilds\u201d veteran was superior in that it arrived\nunder its own power; for most of the veterans had been\ncarried \u2013 not just towed \u2013 on quite massive constructions\nwhich devotedly followed their charges. In the Park it\nwas discovered that \u201cBo\u201d had not enough water to last the\njourney; so what could be better than to fill the spare cans\nfrom the Serpentine. The veterans were started in order of\nage at intervals of thirty seconds. \u201cBo\u201d was number 48 and\nwas soon off to a fine start, with the tender following\nwatchfully.\nThrough London went the procession; past most of\nthe noble buildings and almost all London was taken in\ngallant stride; Brixton Hill caused a little trouble for some\nveterans but not so for the mighty \u201cBoanerges\u201d \u2013 at least\nnot after he realised he would have to go up, so he stopped\nbanging and smoking and went up in triumph, but when he\nhad collected his cheers he flagged and had to be revived by\nsome Serpentine water.\nPerhaps it was imagination but \u201cBo\u201d seemed to have\nmore vocal support throughout the journey than the rest of\nthe entrants put together. \u201cBoanerges\u201d had one misfortune,\nbut quite a minor one. The nut came off one of the the chain\njoining links, but it gave the crew time to stamp their feet,\nand someone experience in the use of a hammer.\nIt seems that the \u201cGuilds\u201d is not very willing for a\ntruce with the \u201cGentlemen\u201d in blue, for they flaunted an\nacquired taxi-horn at every aforementioned \u201cGentleman\u201d they\nencountered as well as going a little too close for comfort.\nThis was perhaps unfortunate as the Police on that Sunday\nwere really co-operative, allowing staggering veterans to\nrattle across the lights. It was true that manners were not\nlacking in the crew of \u201cBoanerges\u201d however, for all gestures\nwhether from on-lookers or Police were acknowledged if only\nby the taxi-horn. After a while it was realised that \u201cBo\u201d was\nspeeding, this being prohibited by the rules of the R.A.C. for\nthis run and at one point \u201cBo\u201d was actually seen to be doing\n40 m.p.h. (although it was downhill).\n\u201cBo\u201d eventually arrived in Maderia Drive with much\ncheering and waving whilst steam issued from the various\nExtracts from the first issue of Felix, published on the 9th of December, 1949\n\n"

    "content": "16 felix FRIDAY 04 DECEMBER 2009\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMUSIC\nPeggy Sue killed the Pirates, but don\u2019t weep!\nI sat down with the girls from Peggy\nSue (Rosa Rex and Katy Klaw) a few\nweeks ago before their headline gig at\nthe ICA and chatted to them about\nchanging their name, their new album\nand traveling around America.\nFelix: What have you been up to this\nsummer?\nPeggy Sue: We\u2019ve been traveling\naround the U.S. quite a lot, touring\nand recording. We recorded our album there and we\u2019ve just come back\nafter touring with Sky Larkin which\nwas great. We\u2019ve definitely caught the\ntravel bug.\nF: Did you enjoy playing to American\naudiences?\nPS: Yeah, some gigs were quite small\nbut we played a few big ones too, but\nmainly it was good from our point of\nview because they hadn\u2019t heard of us\nbefore so they didn\u2019t know about Peggy\nSue & The Pirates so we were able to\npresent our new sound to a fresh audience and they really responded to it.\nF: Tell us a bit about your new sound,\nis this why you\u2019ve changed your name?\nPS: Yep, we feel like a new band so\nthat\u2019s why changed the name. When\nwe started we did the whole anti-folk\nthing and that\u2019s all we could really do.\nBut we\u2019ve gotten more confident mu-sically, we got a drummer [Olly Olly\nOlly], who\u2019s really creative and since\nthen we\u2019ve been trying to make a bigger sound to sort of fill the space, we\u2019re\na lot noisier definitely.\nF: How have your fans reacted to the\nchange?\nPS: At a gig in Southampton someone\ncame up to us asking whether we\u2019d still\nplay the old stuff but we\u2019re not going\nto because we see ourselves as a new\nband. But we\u2019ve had lot of people also\ncome up to us saying that they really\nlike it and for us it\u2019s the right sound.\nF: So you\u2019ve been around for almost\nfour years, you\u2019ve got a new sound and\nfinally a debut album; what\u2019s taken so\nlong?\nPS: It\u2019s a lot of stuff really, firstly, even if\nwe had done a Peggy Sue & The Pirates\nalbum before, it wouldn\u2019t have sounded\nright, it probably would have been a bit\nshit. But probably more importantly,\nwe didn\u2019t really have the money or the\ntime, we started when we were at uni\nin Brighton and, for example, the first\ntime we went touring we supposed to\nbe writing up our dissertations.\nF: How did you get involved with John\nAskew, The Dodos\u2019 producer?\nPS: When we were driving around\nAmerica, we were listening to The\nDodos\u2019 latest album in the car and we\nloved it so much, we both just said\n\u201cWe have to get whoever produced\nthat to produce our album\u201d and so we\napproached him and we went up to\nBrooklyn to produce it.\nF: How do you write your material?\nPS: We actually usually write our songs\nseparately, most of our songs are written mostly by one or the other. But we\nspend so much time together and our\nsongs are inspired by personal experience that we sometimes end up writing\nreally similar songs.\nF: What is success for Peggy Sue?\nPS: Success is playing in every city in\nthe U.K. and knowing that people are\ngoing to be there.\nDo I count as a photographer if I took this photo on a disposable?\nKadhim Shubber\nPeggy Sue\u2019s debut album \u2018Fossils And\nOther Phantoms\u2019 is due early 2010.\nThe first single \u201cYo Mama\u201d is out now\nBelgian music promoters Toutpartout\ncelebrated their 15th birthday in style\nlast Thursday at the Scala, with eight\neclectic but awesome bands. However,\ntwo stuck out in particular.\nKicking the night off with noise-rock\nfrom another dimension, London\u2019s\nmasters of distortion, Todd punished\nthe small crowd gathered in the Hard\nRoom with a disgustingly loud per-formance. With endless waves of fuzz\nand a shit-storm of screaming by their\ndrunk frontman in dungarees, Todd\nplayed an extremely entertaining set,\nshowcasing the raw power of new album \u201cBig Ripper\u201d. After throwing awkward dance moves, the singer wraps\nhis microphone cable around his neck\nthen around his shoe, tugs on it hopping on one leg, choking himself and\nscreaming. As he is about to pass out,\nhe falls to the floor, unwinds the ca-ble, chats up a pretty girl in the audi-ence, grabs another beer from the bar\nand rejoins the band on stage to end\nan enthralling performance. A true\nprofessional.\nBut the band everyone was waiting\nfor that night have become something\nof underground legends over the past\nfew years. Monotonix, a 3-piece of\nvocals, guitars and drums, come from\nTel Aviv, Israel, where they are banned\nfrom half the live venues. This might\nbe due to the excessive male nudity\nthey indulge in, or the fact they set\ntheir equipment \u2013 and themselves \u2013 on\nfire, or maybe that most of their performances end as full-out riots.\nMonotonix refuse to play on stage.\nThey play down in the pit, surrounded\nby the crowd. That\u2019s one thing about\nMonotonix; you do not so much\n\u201cwatch\u201d as \u201cexperience\u201d them. Guitarist Moshe Vegas stands alone in\ntight sport shorts and bangs out a bad\nmama-jamma garage rock riff. Drummer Bonanza the Cat jumps off the\nstage, topless, wearing a massive chain\naround his neck, to the sound of excited cheers. Vegas\u2019 voodoo riffing sends\nBonanza into a trance-like fit, writhing on the ground, till moustachioed\nsinger Elvis grabs his legs and drags\nhim around the room. After some acrobatic poses, the time for partying has\ncome. Bonanza heavy-handedly strikes\nthe snare, the heat is on, and they\ndon\u2019t stop rockin\u2019 till their set is over.\nElvis steals every beer he can from the\nfrightened audience and pours them\non Bonanza as he plays. The drum kit\nis drenched, the crowd is ecstatic.\nElvis starts to sing; it sounds like Borat doing AC-DC covers. I mean that\nin the best way possible. None of their\nsongs are particularly memorable, but\nthey merge into a chaotic set during\nwhich Elvis runs back and forth, climbs\non any surface/person possible and\njumps into the crowd. It is an exhilarating performance and no one in the\nroom can look away from the three\ninsane(ly) entertaining performers.\nVegas slides along the packed venue,\nbreaking out his sharpest dance moves,\nElvis does all he can to distract drummer Bonanza: puts a bucket over his\nhead, even picks up a girl from the\naudience, dumps her on his head and\nhumps them both violently. Bonanza\nnever budges.\nAs well as being great entertainers,\nMonotonix are genuinely talented mu-sicians. Every time a song ends, Vegas\nkeeps a riff going, while Elvis takes\napart the drum kit and randomly sets\nit up somewhere else, so you\u2019re never\nat the \u201cfront\u201d or the \u201cback\u201d: the gig is all\naround you. This is where Monotonix\nbase their sets around something most\nbands today have forgotten. A good live\nband involves the audience. A perfect\ngig feels like taking part in something\nunique. By the end of Monotonix\u2019 set,\nthe entire crowd was grinning madly,\nclapping endlessly, grasping hands\nwith the band and each other.

    "content": "7\nfelix FRIDAY 04 DECEMBER 2009\nDan Wan Editor-in-Chief 2009-10\nI\nbelieve most of us reading this\nwill find it hard to even begin to\nimagine what life was like as an\nImperial student in December\n1949.\nThe campus, for one thing, would\nhave looked entirely different without\nthe current 60s-built monstrosities that\nare the Sherfield, Huxley and Blackett\nLab. One building that has remained\nin place, and in fact grown with Imperial\u2019s history, is the Union Building in\nBeit Quad. Out of which rose felix, a\npublication to \u201ccomment\u201d and \u201cbring\nto attention\u201d the issues and activities\nof College life. These of which Pheonix, Imperial\u2019s long-standing literary\nmagazine, could not address due its\ninfrequent distribution.\nOriginal Editor, E. M. Hughes, had\nenough faith in the students of Imperial College to invest his time in beginning this paper 60 years ago; some of\nhis first words in felix made sure that\nthe students knew exactly that. \u201cThe\nsuccess or failure of this paper depends\nprincipally upon you, our readers\u2026 we\ndepend on you to maintain a lively correspondence in our columns.\u201d\nThough the first 600 copies of felix\nsold out within the hour that morning\non the 9th of December, hindsight is a\nwonderful thing, and especially hindsight taken from a such a distance as\n2009\u2019s felix. I like to believe that felix\nhas been qualified a success when put\nin context of E.M. Hughes\u2019 original mission statement. felix not only still unreservedly reports on College, but these\ndays, on its own Union too.\nThe cat has grown claws too sharp\nand has become too fearsome to be editorially caged by any institution.\nThis is a privilege gained by the work\nof the thousands upon thousands of\nstudents over these past 60 years. It is\nan uprising of student voices that has\nculminated in standards at which felix\nand its editors run by today.\nIt has some poignancy in the fact the\nvery first issue contains the very same\nmessage that I have been pushing this\nyear.\n\u201cAny contribution will be welcomed,\nwhether it be a full article on the marital customs of the Watussi or a chance\nremark heard in the bar\u201d.\nI\u2019m not sure anyone ever did cough\nup an editorial on the marital customs\nof the Watussi (we are still waiting), but\nthe message is still the same. Any piece\nof writing that makes it down into our\noffice, in one form or another, is entirely\nappreciated. We laugh with, laugh at\nand learn from the authors of every article we receive. This year in particular\nhas been astounding in terms of contri-butions. Each page of felix bursts with\nseveral different by-lines, and as editors\nwe are having a hard time putting all\nthat we receive to print the same week.\nWe are slowly building a backlog of articles to go to print but it is problem that\nalso evidences how successful a student\nnewspaper felix as become in recent\nyears.\nAmongst all the satirical laughter and\nquestionable humour (of which has\nbeen questioned unreservedly), there is\nan underlying yet prominent pride that\nallows most Imperial students to be\nglad to call felix their own.\nAnother issue that we must address\nis that of the rumours surrounding felix\nthis week. On three separate occasions,\nI have been bewildered by suggestions\nthat we don\u2019t have enough money to go\nto print this week.\nI can truly say that these rumours\nhave no substance, and though I\u2019m personally displeased with the idea that this\nrumour is circulating College, it also\nmeans people care about felix enough\nto be bothered to ask.\nI am proud to realise that felix runs on\nits own revenue each week. As a student\nnewspaper, it means we are susceptible\nto the blowing gales of recession. However, as we resist the toppling winds,\nour feet are fimly on the ground. Any\nsituation to arise is still exactly that: to\nstill arise.\nI am glad to say that felix\u2019s reputation as an award-winning newspaper,\nand also the newspaper that reaches\nthe eyes of approximately 12,000 Imperial College students every single week,\nhas allowed us some financial pull when\nother student newspapers would have\nbeen forced to take mitigating action.\nfelix\u2019s finances have been a long time\nresponsibility of every Editor past. The\nwork done is very much behind the paper facade that is our weekly publica-tion. Those that govern the paper\u2019s finances have been kept up-to-date with\nthecurrentsituation,andIamconfident\nthey still entrust me, as Editor, to monitor felix editorially and administratively.\nKeep the Cat free.\n1949-50 HUGHES EM\n1950-51 HARGREAVES CM\n1951-52 MIDGLEY JW\nWEARNE SH\nELDRIDGE KP\n1952-53 WEARNE SH\nBRAY AR\n1953-54 KALE DC\nSTARMER GH\n1954-55 SEFLEY JS\n1955-56 SOUTHGATE PA\nHUDSON WJ\n1956-57 BRAMLE JV\nGRIFFIN DJH\n1957-58 LEVIN PH\n1958-59 KERROD RF\nHONER MR\n1959-60 BARRON MF\n\u00011960-61 CARTER J\nCHEENEY RF\n1970-71 SIMS AJ\nROGERS JAV\n1971-72 SUGDEN DA\n1972-73 DOWSON OF\n1961-62 GILBERT D\nBARRON MF\nCHANOMAL A\n1962-63 PAWLOWICZ AT\n1963-64 COMBES JM\n1964-65 WALKER NJ\n1965-66 WILLIAMS DJ\n1966-67 HARRISON CG\nPOTTER DE\n1967-68 REDMAYNE RJ\nCOOPER JD\n1968-69 HEATH PA\nEBDON LC\n1969-70 WILLIAMSON MJ\nCARR JC\nCHANT DC\n1973-74 CAMPBELL A\nWANDSWORTH PA\n1974-75 WILLIAMS MJL\n1975-76 EKPENYONG PEJU\n1976-77 DEWEY CG\n1977-78 SUSS JD\n1978-79 HARRIS JL\n1979-80 PALMER CR\n1980-81 MARSHALL SJ\n1981-82 SMITH MA\n1982-83 TAYLOR MS\n1983-84 GHOSH PK\n1984-85 ROWE DG\n1985-86 SOUTHEY DH\n1986-87 JONES D\n1987-88 HACKNEY JD\n1988-89 GOODWIN WR\n1989-90 SMEDLEY DG\n1990-91 BUTCHER A\n1991-92 HARRINGTON A\n1992-93 BEAVAN J\n1993-94 LAND RG\n1994-95 BENNALLACK O\n1995-96 WALTERS RACHEL\n1996-97 FEAKES AD\n1997-98 THOMSON (JE)\n1998-99 SEXTON E\n1999-00 ROBERTS DAVID\n2000-01 CLIFFORD JOHN\n\u00012001-02 DUGDALE WILLIAM\n2002-03 DUGDALE WILLIAM\n2003-04 COBY ALEXANDER\n2004-05 EDWARDS DAVID\n2005-06 NEATE RUPERT\n2006-07 SYKES ANDREW\n2007-08 ROBERTS TOM\n2008-09 NEDIC JOVAN\nTHE FULL LISTING: 60 YEARS OF SLEEP-DEPRIVED FELIX EDITORS.

Now normally at 9am,\nyou expect most people to be sleepily\nscratching their eyes/cracks and having a coffee.\nInstead we were welcomed by armed\nstudents equipped with water balloons\nand a sling shot. So in true Imperial\nform we decided to get stuck in a have\na morning beer bong.\nThe competitions included giant\nthey had beaten previously in the year.\nIt turned out to be a straightforward\nmatch for the team, with the opposing\ncoach constantly setting Essex targets\nof small amounts of points to achieve.\nGreat serve receiving from Lea Seafer,\nand effective blocking from Alex\nKrieger gave Imperial a comfortable\nwin in the first set.\nThe second set was motivated by\ncoach Ercu\u2019s promise of a drink each if\nEssex got less than ten points, but ten\npress-ups for ever point over ten they\nMen Continue\n100% record in\nSussex\nContinued from Page 44\nRobert Winston, takes the floor to present a talk\nbased on the content of his outstanding book, \u2018The\nStory of G-d\u2019.

In the end the pennant went to\nNicky (23:21.73) with Ro taking the\nrunner-up position (23:33.77).

Meanwhile on the second court,\nthe men were playing the University of\nKent.\nNow wearing different shorts, captain Marc and experienced outside\nhitter Christoph Datler linked well to\ncreate some effective play, while Platon\nVogiatzoglou used his powerful hit to\ngreat effect. In the end it was an easy\nwin for the men\u2019s team, who maintained their 100% unbeaten record.\nAnother victorious weekend for the\nclub, who continue to go from strength\nto strength. The club look to continue\ntheir success at their home tournament in Bethnal Green this weekend.\nScullers\u2019 Head\nshows from all.\nThe standard of skiing and boarding was ridiculously high (the winning\ntrick for the ski big air was a 1080! In\nImperial terms that\u2019s 6\u03c0).\nIt all started going off in the after-noon, with the finals of the Big Air taking place to some massive tunes courtesy of the Red Bull pick-up truck with\na set of decks on the roof and a huge\nsound system in the boot.\nAt the end of the comp, everyone\nrushed on to the slope and provided\none of the coolest images I\u2019ve seen this\nyear, 800 students bouncing up and\ndown with the sun setting in the background over the coast of Edinburgh.\nThe night had begun.\nThe BUSC committee booked out a\nclub in Edinburgh that night, and after\nan evening kebab (which led to a certain member of Imperial having a not-so-tactical chunder on the way into the\nclub) we headed on into City club.\nThe scene in the club was similar to\nthe scene on the slope, a multitude of\ndrunken skiers, a massive vibe of excitement about the upcoming season,\nand fear of the following morning\u2019s\n9am races.\nDespite an awesome DJ, some amazing conversations with strangers in the\nsmoking area, and the discovery of a\nsecret upstairs bar with no queue, the\nhighlight of the night had to be watching snowsports captain, Jamie Perrelet,\nwalk straight into a glass door.\nThe next day (again after an hour\nand a half of sleep) we reluctantly piled\ninto the bus again to get back onto the\nslope.\nArriving there on time, we looked\nout the window, saw it was raining,\nand proceeded to have a three and a\nhalf hour nap in the van.\nAfter waking up we decided the only\nsolution to our hangovers was baked\ngoods, so we drove down the road and\nasked a local builder where the nearest\nshop was, he replied with \u2018hinka cum-fae cashore canfeh, Ahl hityi oar hied\n\u2018caw taughtie\u2019.\nNot wanting to be rude, we thanked\nhim, well Tom thanked him and I\nchuckled into my bra, and headed off.\nThe skill on the second day was in-credible, and despite the rain and the\nwind (not much of a surprise in Scotland) everyone rode with loads of style.\nThe collective hangover slowly\nmerged into another round of collective drunkenness and before we knew\nit, the riding was over, and the partying\nhad begun again.\nSaturday night was the final black tie\nball, after spending a couple of hours\ntrying to get tickets (they had all sold\nout on the Friday), we eventually managed to get in to the ball held in a massive rugby stadium.\nI headed straight to the bar, but about\none minute and thirty six seconds after\nour entry, Tom sprinted up to me and\ntold me that Jack had been a little bit\n(a lot) naughty and was kicked out of\nthe club.\nThis put a massive downer on the\nnight, after a twenty quid entry fee\nand all our great efforts to find tick-ets, someone had already been sent\npacking. Luckily for us, the bouncers weren\u2019t the brightest chaps in the\nworld, and we swiftly managed to get\nJack back in.\nEverything was looking pretty good\nand the awards were handed out, when\nfive minutes before the end, Jamie and\nAmaury were thrown out when Jamie\ntried to replicate the day\u2019s freestyle on\nAmaury\u2019s shoulders.\nAll in all an amazing night, a weekend to remember, and a hangover\nthat has lasted fifteen days and still\ncounting.\nIf you want to spin around on Amaury\u2019s shoulders, get on over to www.\nstudentskiing.com with clubcode =\n\u2018imperial\u2019 to grab yourself one of the\nlast remaining places on the imperial\nski and snowboard holiday.\nEveryone is welcome and the price\nis unbeatable: \u00a3329 includes lift-pass,\ntravel and accommodation. Absolutely\nfinal booking deadline is tonight, no\nother chances!\nJamie Perrelet Snowsports\nContinued from Page 44\nImperial Snowsports atop the peak of Scotland\u2019s finest artifical mountain.

Somewhere-shire...\nRAG has had its first large-scale\nevent of the year with a great degree\nof success. Alex Dahinten, the RAG\nChair shares some details of the event\nwith felix.The idea of the event was that\nyou get put on a bus and with a blindfold on, driven to a top-secret location\nin the absolute middle of nowhere and\neventually make it back to the Union\nwithout spending ANY money. The\nteams were comprised of groups of either two or three, with at least one guy\nin each team (no this wasn\u2019t an Imperial law; it was mostly to do with safety).\nThe big question raised was to do\nwith how money is raised. Simple, Alex\nsaid; through funding! Once signed up\nto the event, participants were given\naccess to the website \u201cJustGiving\u201d.\nOnce the account was set up, they were\nable to harrass their family, friends and\nanyone they knew into sponsoring\ntheir stunt. To make things more in-teresting, some teams decided to wear\nfancy dress. One team even dressed up\nas three Tic-Tacs! Some teams also decided to set goals for amounts of money raised. Depending on the amount of\nmoney raised they would perform crazy tasks or wear something ridiculous\nlike a leotard or speedos. Given the\npictures below, goals were definitely\nreached and exceeded.\nPrizes were awarded to different\nteams for different reasons:\n- Most outrageous mode of\ntransportation\n- Most money raised\n- Best or most imaginative\ncostume.\nRAG saw the event as an opportunity\nto show that the organisation has become a seriously active and engaging\none once again. RAG has held several\nsmaller events before Lost that have\nbeen popular and this is sure to con-tinue, including the hugely successful\nSports Night held in conjunction with\nthe RCSU. The string of great events\nthat students love is bound to continue.\nA\nfter visions of being\ndropped off in bandit\ncountry (aka the north)\nwe were pleasantly\nsurprised that we had in fact\ngone to the lovely southwest.\nOur first job after we were\nhurled off the bus in a Guantanamo Bay-style hood was to establish where we actually were.\nUnfortunately Iwan had other\nideas and made a beeline for\nthe nearest sheep. After a short\ntime Iwan had cleaned himself\nup and we had established with\na miffed lorry driver - not even\nremotely aroused by the three\nsexy men in drag - and we were\nnear Salisbury near Wiltshire.\nWith that milestone achieved\nwe headed to the nearest pub\nfor some light refreshment and\nto formulate a plan. The plan\nmainly consisted of discussing\nthe various merits of the bar-girls, who were lovely and eating\na fine lunch.\nAfter sinking a few jars and\nchinning a few gins we set off\nhome. As we left the Pub the\nlocal plod turned up, having received word of the Welshman\u2019s\nantics. After a bit of police brutality (they got out of their-car) and some argy bargy\n(took a photo) we had secured\na lift\nto\nSalisbury.\nDuring this journey\nwe found out that there is a local\ntranny who kicks around the car\nparks which explains why the\nlorry driver thought he had seen\nus before. After arriving in Salisbury we tried in vain to hitch a\nlift with passing motorists. They\nclearly were not impressed by\nTom\u2019s or my efforts and mainly\ngave us the finger. Thankfully\na delightful woman on her way\nback from her shopping offered\nto take us to the next service station on the motorway.\nOn arrival it was noted that\nseveral police cars and a fire engine were arranged around the\nforecourt. Turns out the place\nhad been ramraided and we had\njust missed out on a potential\nstandoff. Good times.\nSo onto the next service sta-tion. As we arrived, a Ford Mustang pulled up and we thought\nhell lets ask for a lift. Fortunately\nthe driver was a Lad and offered\nto take us right into London.\nSure enough as any lad does\nhe sank some snakebites and\nnecked a bird before setting off.\nWe sped down the motorway\nat around 100mph, and arrived\nin London in good time. From\nhere we took a helicopter/tube\ntrain for free back to the union.\nAll in all a lovely day out in the\ncountryside coupled with a ride\nin a super car. Not bad\nreally!\nYup, we\u2019re going to die out here.\nI was looking for the Fake Treasure but got Lost!\nTeam Priscilla Queen of the\nDesert share their experiences\nof getting majorly Lost with\nfelix\n\n"

    "content": "11\nfelix FRIDAY 04 DECEMBER 2009\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk SCIENCE\nOne of the key postulates of Einstein\u2019s\ntheory of special relativity is that the\nspeed of light in a vacuum is constant.\nThis means that whatever the energy\nof the photons making up the ray of\nlight, its speed is always the same. It\u2019s\ncalled Lorentz invariance, and it\u2019s been\non trial once again, courtesy of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) Collaboration. In a paper published in Nature last month, Abdo and colleagues\nat the collaboration analysed the light\ncoming from a distant and fleeting\ngamma ray burst to try and pick up any\nvariation in the speed of its photons \u2013\nand found no variation, at least down\nto a limit. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)\nare believed to be released during supernovae and are the brightest events\noccurring in the universe \u2013 despite the\nfact that most of them are billions of\nlight years away from Earth. The radiation emitted during a GRB is extremely\nintense, typically releasing as much energy in a few seconds as the Sun will\nin its entire lifetime. They are good\ncandidates for measuring a variation\nin light speed due to the cosmological distances the light has to travel to\nreach us \u2013 even tiny variations in photon speed are amplified enough to be\nrevealed in the sharp features of the\nlight curve emitted during the burst.\nResearchers at the Fermi LAT Collaboration were alerted to a particularly interesting gamma-ray burst after it\nwas picked up by both the Large Area\nSpecial relativity is\nput to the test\nTelescope and the Gamma-ray Burst\nMonitor, which are aboard the Fermi\nGamma-ray Space Telescope. This\ntelescope is a joint project between\nNASA, the US Department of Energy\nand government agencies in France,\nGermany, Italy, Japan and Sweden, and\nis currently in low Earth orbit. A pho-ton, with an energy of 31GeV, emitted\nless than a second after the start of the\nburst was singled out and used to find\na limit for the variation of the speed\nof light. In special relativity this limit\nshould not exist, as there is no length\nat which the Lorentz invariance should\nbe broken. However, some theoretical physicists think that at very small\nlengths it could in fact be violated. In\norder to formulate a \u201ctheory of everything\u201d, they are attempting to reconcile\ngravitational effects with quantum mechanics and create a theory of quantum\ngravity. According to these theories, at\nthe Planck scale (lengths of approximately 1.63 x 10-34 cm) quantum mechanics should interact with gravity,\ninfluencing the nature of space-time\nand so changing the speed of light. In\nthe research conducted by the Fermi\nLAT Collaboration, however, Lorentz\ninvariance was found by two independent methods to hold true down to the\nPlanck length divided by 1.2. This is a\nblow to some quantum gravity theories\nthat require the fabric of space-time to\nbe altered on small scales. While this\nmay be bad news for some modern day\nphysicists, it\u2019s good news for Einstein \u2013\nafter over 100 years, his theory of special relativity still stands.\nKelly Oakes Science Reporter\nArtists impression of a gamma ray burst detected by the Fermi telescope.\nPhotons from gamma ray bursts have called\ninto question the Lorentz invariance\nThis week marks the 109th Nobel Prize\naward ceremony. In line with the 60th\nanniversary of felix, we take a look at\nthe people who received the award for\nscientific achievement back in 1949.\nPhysics - Hideki Yukawa:\nAfter graduating from Kyoto university\nin 1926, Yukawa became particularly\ninterested in the theory of elementary\nparticles. In 1935 he published a paper\non meson theory and proton-neutron\ninteractions. He received the Nobel\nPrize for Physics \u2018for his prediction of\nthe existence of mesons on the basis of\ntheoretical work on nuclear forces\u2019 after\nthe discovery in 1947 of his theorised\npion by Cecil Powell, Guiseppe Occhialini and Cesar Lattes.\nChemistry - William Giauque:\nAfter gaining a PhD in Chemistry (with\na minor in Physics) from the University\nof California in 1922, Giauque initially\nhad plans to become an engineer but\ndeveloped an interest in research under Prof. Gilbert N Lewis (famous for\nthe discovery of the covalent bond).\nMuch of his research was dedicated to\ndemonstrating the third law of thermodynamics as a basic law and developing methods by which temperatures\nbelow 1 Kelvin may be observed. Accordingly, he was awarded the Nobel\nPrize for Chemistry \u2018for his contributions in the field of chemical thermo-dynamics, particularly concerning the\nbehaviour of substances at extremely\nlow temperatures.\u2019\nPhysiology or Medicine - Walter\nHess and Egas Moniz\nWalter Hess received his medical degree from the University of Zurich in\n1906 and trained an ophthalmologist\nbefore turning to research. He started\nto map the parts of the diencephalon\nregion of the brain following on from\nhis initial interest in blood flow and\nrespiration. He received half of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine\n\u2018for the discovery of the functional organisation of the interbrain as a coordinator of the activities of the internal\norgans.\u2019\nEgas Moniz studied medicine at the\nUniversity of Coimbra before training\nas a neurologist. After a brief career in\npolitics, he returned to medicine and\nin 1927 developed cerebral angiogra-phy, a method allowing blood vessels in\nthe brain to be visualised. He received\nhalf the Nobel Prize \u2018for his discovery\nof the therapeutic value of leucotomy\n[lobotomy] in certain psychoses\u2019.\nNobel Prize winners of 1949\nBrigette Atkins Science Editor\n\n"

Hirst has drawn us as spectators\nright through a gamut to the sublime,\nthen whipped round and laughed in\nour faces with ridicule. I shall try to\nexplain how I have come to feel this\nway in the following article.\nMy experience of his paintings has\ninspired not only suspicion, but also\ncynicism in my interpretation of his\nstyle and subject matter. For exam-ple: does Hirst have a deep-set hatred\nfor creatures of the animal kingdom?\nWhen he is not drowning sharks and\nyoung calves in formaldehyde, he is exploding crows in a spatter of cadmium\nand feathers on his canvases.\nAs for Hirst\u2019s formal style, only a\nyear ago the Tate Britain held a retrospective of Francis Bacon\u2019s works.\nBacon\u2019s tendency to use the triptych\nformat and fill his spaces with loose\ngeometric structures painted in narrow lines has clearly inspired Hirst.\nIf we are to compare Hirst\u2019s portraits\nwith Bacon\u2019s, they differ greatly. The\nlarger expanse of a Bacon, such as\n\u2018Chimpanzee\u2019 of 1955 has a worked\nsurface of blacks and blues, with fine\nwhite, cobwebby lines drifting across\nit, yet structured so as to form a cage\naround the creature inside (very much\nalive), signified by his wide-open jaw\nand head thrown back in raw animal\ncry. The detail of this face completely\ncontrasts with the background. The\ncreature\u2019s face is like a vortex of the\ngreater expanse of the picture, drawing you in to its deadly mouth \u2013 a device used frequently by Bacon. Hirst\u2019s\n\u2018Portrait of a Man IV\u2019 (2008) is quite\ndifferent. The background is dark\nand the palette of blues and black is\nsimilar, with the contrasting details of\nwhite. This deathly, bluish face creates\na sort of inverted portrait. Hirst\u2019s figure is flattened \u2013 his face crudely lit\nfrom the side, the shape of his mouth\nand nose rendered with na\u00efve difficulty in impasto oils.\nYet this tendency to imitate the artistic works of a mind whose creativity\nat least seemed somewhat disturbed\nrings for me only of clich\u00e9. Hirst\u2019s private life \u2013 at least any part that might\ngive an explanation to the obsession\nwith death in his art \u2013 has not been\nmade clear throughout his history\nas an artist. Bacon on the other hand\nhad a friend, possibly lover, who he\napparently goaded to suicide through\ninsults. The work resulting from this\nepisode in Bacon\u2019s life appears transcribed on the canvas with difficulty,\nto express his feelings: the individuals\nhe made portraits of began to literally\nlose their facial features, as if the artist was unable to look into the eyes of\nthose he painted.\nWhat I am trying to imply is that\nHirst has made \u2018art\u2019 and existed as an\nartist in a manner which up until now\nseems to have mocked and ridiculed\nthe body of the institution. He has used\nthe art auction to experiment in dragging the prices of artworks above the\nmillion mark and created the most expensive art object on earth, merely for\nthe sake of having someone buy it to\nexacerbate the situation of culture in a\ncapitalist world. Then he turns to the\noil painting: a traditional, exalted and\nadmired art form, out of which famous\nprotagonists such as Edouard Manet, J.\nM. W. Turner, and of course Franciss\nBacon, created beautiful illusions of\nferocious sea storms, courtesans that\nshook French society\u2019s ideology and a\npope that seemed to be screaming his\nway to hell on his throne.\nHirst is by no means setting a new\nmilestone in subject matter: his skulls\nand lemons speak of still life and Dutch\ngenre motifs (the skull was a symbol of\nvanitas, literally a warning against foolish vanity in life that would ultimately\nlead to one\u2019s death) and stylistically we\nhave already witnessed his homage to\nBacon.\nMy concern as an art enthusiast is\nthat the public will not be able to see\nthe wood for the trees: and mistakenly\nadmire Hirst\u2019s foray into expressive\npainting, when he is merely entreating you to do this in the first place, to\nmake an example of what \u2018tourists\u2019 we\nare to the art gallery, when I know this\nis not how I and many others feel. Even\nthough I am wary of Hirst\u2019s intentions\nas an artist, I still appreciate the debate\nwhich is thrown our way from such\nexhibitions. After all, I enjoyed something of the grand sale at Sotheby\u2019s last\nautumn, if only to see a huge number\nof his installation works collected in\none place.\nI would like to encourage you to go\nand form your own opinion of Hirst\u2019s\npaintings, but don\u2019t expect to see any\nformaldehyde.\nRosie Milton reviews Damien Hirst\u2019s exhibition of paintings, Nothing Matters, at both White Cube spaces\nFrom the sublime to the ridiculous?\nDamien Hirst\u2019s Insomnia, not a drop of formaldehyde in sight\nT\nerry Pratchett\u2019s Discworld: a fictional flat\nworld that floats through\nspace on the back of four\nelephants, which in turn\nstand on the back of a Great Turtle\u2026\nSeeing as we are at Imperial I\u2019m probably already preaching to the converted.\nMany of you would probably stop me\nright now and explain that the Turtle\nis called The Great A\u2019tuin; the world,\nthough fictional, throws more satirical\nlight on real life issues than a month of\nJeremy Kyle repeats, and that overall,\nit\u2019s just pretty darn brilliant.\nWhat you may not know is that Dramsoc have decided to take on Wyrd Sisters,\none of the best known Discworld tales,\nfor their Christmas performance. What\nyou would like to know is: \u2018is it any good?\u2019\nFor the uninitiated, Wyrd Sisters shows\nPratchett indulging in one of his favourite pastimes, riffing on popular literature:\nthis time, Shakespeare, notably Hamlet\nand Macbeth. As such, prior knowledge\nof both plays will help with some of the\njokes, but such is Pratchett\u2019s skill that\nthere\u2019s a lot more to get out than just references to long dead playwrights.\nA play of this sort, involving witches,\njailbreak, numerous instances of conjur-ing, and at one point \u2018flying\u2019 broomsticks,\nrequires more than acting, it actually\nrequires some technical skill. And here\nonce again, Dramsoc manages to do impressive things with limited resources.\nThere\u2019s some great pyrotechnics, including a brilliant exploding door. Some good\nsound effects, an earthquake that rolls\nimpressively around the room, good use\nof a trapdoor during a demon invocation,\nand a play-within-a-play scene (like all\ngood Shakespeare) that inventively splits\nthe stage into actors (within the show)\nbackstage, and audience (within the\nshow) watching said play. If that doesn\u2019t\nmake you even slightly curious, then you\nare made of meaner stuff than I am.\nAs any fan of Doctor Who pre-Russell\nT. Davies and the first six seasons of Red\nDwarf will tell you, wobbly sets, camp\ncostumes, and kitsch production values\nare good things. These lend the endeavour a certain charm that tells you it isn\u2019t\ntrying to be the next Avatar, but is just\nbeing what it is, promising a good, silly,\nand ultimately fun time. This show has all\nthree in spades, which works in its favour.\nThere\u2019s a home-made charm about it that\nimmediately puts you at ease and let\u2019s you\nknow from the off that you are not going\nhave to do too much thinking.\nPratchett always suffers when adapted\nfrom page to stage, every reader has already directed the story in their head,\nand on a much larger scale than can be\nprovided on any stage, so any production\n(in my mind) will not compare favourably\nif you have read the book. Subtleties are\nlost, descriptive passages that draw so\nperfect a picture just cannot be acted out,\nand the thought processes detailed in the\nbooksareespeciallytricky.Thiscanresult\nin non-sequiturs and it can be hard to\nkeepholdofthenarrative.Eventherecent\nmulti-million pound Sky TV adaptations\nfell victim to this fact. So what\u2019s left?\nLike all good writers, one of the best\nthings about Pratchett is the language. If\nyou are going to succeed with Pratchett,\nyou have to get the language right. I am\npleased to say that in some sections of\nthis show, it zips back and forth like you\nalways hoped it would. The interplay between the central trio (the Wyrd Sisters),\nwhich holds the show together, works\nwell with the three actresses making use\nof the respective statuses of their charac-ters. There are some well-executed jokes\n(I particularly enjoyed the \u2018Is this a dagger\nI see before me?\u2019 line). And though it isn\u2019t\namatteroflanguage,theescalatingjokein\nwhich Duke Felmet tries to get the blood\noff his hands first by rubbing with sandpa-per, and then with an ever-present wood\nsander is genius.\nA related issue with Pratchett is you really need to sell the world you are in. The\nbest adaptations of his works in any media\nimmediately sell the characters usually as\nBritish cultural stereotypes, so Granny\nWeatherwax walks on stage and straight\naway, you get that this is an old no-non-sense, not to be messed with, West CountryMarm.Therearesuccessfulattemptsin\nthis show at that, notably Shamini Bundell\nas the motherly Nanny Ogg, and Aaron\nSingh&LilyTophammakeagoodcomedy\ndouble act, as the Duke and Lady Felmet,\nplaying characters that are totally oblivious\nto their own ridiculousness. Their Doctor\nEvil style laughter that slowly peters out\nwas one of the moments in which I found\nmyself laughing without realising it.\nIt is however a big ask of a cast of 22,\nsome of whom do not appear familiar\nwith the Pratchett world or the type of\nlanguage being used. As such, the world\nis not kept consistent, with accents ranging from South England to South France\nwith a slight detour via Eastern Europe,\nbuthey,that\u2019sstudenttheatre.Anditkinda\nadds to the aforementioned home-made\ncharm of the thing. All-in-all, considering\nthat the cast is entirely made up of Imperialstudents,thisisagoodtryatahardjob,\nputting Pratchett on stage.\nAny review exists to ultimately tell you\nwhat to do and the bottom line of this review is: see this show, take a friend or two,\nhave a pint in DaVinci\u2019s and have a good\ntime, because that is what this show promises and ultimately offers.\nShamini Bundell, Lauren Waterman, Ilse Daly as the maiden, the mother and...\n\n"

A criss-cross\nnatural stone paving (pictured left) will stretch across the full width of the carriageway\n(building to building), and from South Ken tube to Hyde Park. Pedestrians will have\napproximately double the space that cars will be designated. The current dual carriageway\nfor motorists will be reduced to two single lanes. There will be no curbs, road tarmac or\npavements. The level surface is meant to encourage safer and more fluid pedestrian and\nmotorist interaction. Between the pedestrian and motoring zones, there will be a drop-off\nand cycle rack strip, but there will no place for informal roadside parking. Parking places\nwill be marked off at 90 degree angles to the majority movement of passing people and\nvehicles.\n\u00a31m\nfromCityofWestiministertowards\nthe Exhibition Road Project. They\ntechnically govern the northern\nhalf of Exhibition Road.\nA paved single-level surface\nSouth Kensington station has notoriously been a busy and\ncrowded place where people waiting for several buses meet\ncommuters going into and coming out of the underground\nstation. Thurloe Street has been an unpleasant experience\nfor the less-able commuter or parents with children in\npushchairs. The new plans are to make the north and south\nentrances to the station open piazzas for local shops and\ncafes to thrive.\nThe idea of this area surrounding the station is to turn it\ninto South Kensington\u2019s \u2018town centre\u2019, whilst Exhibition\nRoad becomes the cultural avenue and main attraction of\nthe area. The \u2018town centre\u2019 will cater to local residents much\nmore.\nPedestrianised space has been opened up on the south\nentrance to the station, and several large chains of cafes are\nreportedly interested in setting up shop in the vicinity. felix\nwas told by project leaders that the borough are in favour of\nrentingpublicpremisestoindependently-ownedbusinesses.\nOpen piazza around South Kensington station\nThe crossing used by nearly all Imperial\nstudentstravellinginbybusandtubemust\ncrossCromwellRoadtoreachthecampus.\nPresently, it involves crossing the road\nin two parts, resting on an intermediate\npedestrian island. The Exhibition Road\nProject will see a straighter crossing that\nwill allow pedestrians to walk across\nCromwell Road without halting.\nThis is the one of two formal crossings\non Exhibition Road.\nCromwell crossing\nAs part of Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201ccycling\nrevolution\u201d, one of 400 bike-hire\ndocks around London will be located\non Thurloe Street, outside South\nKensington station. People will be\nable to pick up and drop off bicycles\navailable from these docks, which are\nclaimed never to be more than 300m\napart. Proposals to place a dock by\nthe Brompton Oratory in South Ken\nare currently being opposed by local\nresidents.\nBikes for hire\nventional road?\nWe\u2019re looking to create a greater\nsense of awareness amongst all the users of the space, and not just relying on\nthe mechanics and engineering to manage it all for you; guard railings in the\nmiddle of the road, traffic lights changing for you, and places to cross.\nIgnoring responsibility can happen at\nthe moment, but the cars will be going\nslower, plus pavements will be wider. If\nyou were disabled or had a pushchair\ncoming out of South Ken station, the\npavement is very narrow with buses and\nlorries turning through that road. This\nspace will be not only more attractive to\nuse, but safer.\nThe area will be paved in natural\nstone; when drivers drive through any\narea which looks a little bit different,\nthey will drive a bit more cautiously due\nto an element of uncertainty.\nThere has been criticism of similar\n\u2018single surface\u2019 schemes. What is being done to ensure the safety of blind\nor partially sighted people crossing\nExhibition Road?\nIt is specifically the Guide Dogs that\nhave criticised this scheme, they say the\nonly differentiator between pavement\nand road for a dog is a kerb, but kerbs\nare a trip hazard and are not actually an\nideal barrier for people with physical\ndisabilities. So removing the kerbs can\nbe very helpful. It is certainly possible\nto train guide dogs with a recognisable\nstrip of corduroy paving all away up.\nShared space schemes have been\nlargely successful in low-density ar-eas. As one of the largest and most\nprominent stretches of road to be\nsubject to a \u2018single surface\u2019 scheme,\nthe new Exhibition Road will be\nunder close scrutiny. It has been argued that the concept will not work\non such a busy, congested city road.\nDoes this add extra pressure on the\nBorough for this project to work?\nExhibition Road isn\u2019t one of the\nbusiest roads in the borough, the traffic volumes there are relatively mod-est, and so it lends itself to this kind of\nmanagement.\nAccess-wise, the idea is that a single\nsurface removes the obstacle of ups\nand downs of kerbs and roads on a\nconventional street pattern. The museums and galleries have invested huge\nsums of money making their insides\naccessible, but it\u2019s no good if people\ncan\u2019t get 200 yards from the tube station to the front door.\nUpon arrival onto the South Kensington\ncampus for the first time, it may have\nseemed like an ironic coincidence to\nmanyImperialstudentsthattheCollegeof\nScience, Technology and Medicine, along\nwith the neighbouring Science Museum,\nboth stand in such close proximity to\nthe rather more arty institutions which\ninclude the Victoria and Albert Museum\nand the Royal School of Music.\nIt might therefore come as a surprise to\nlearn that this high density collection of\nacademic and cultural hubs from all ends\nof the spectrum were in fact deliberately\nconcentrated onto Exhibition Road and\nits vicinity by the vision of Prince Albert\nand the Executive Committee of the\nRoyal Commission for the Exhibition of\n1851.\nThis Great Exhibition was borne to\ncongregate the achievements of British\nculture, industry and science, as well as\nthose of its international colonies. Prince\nAlbert materialised his idea with the help\nof architect Joseph Paxton, and in May\n1851, the specially constructed Glass\nPalace that stood in Hyde Park opened\nto the public. The reported number of\nvisitors The Exhibition received during\nits run is thought to be a third of the\nBritish population at the time. Guests\nincluded the esteemed Charles Darwin,\nLewis Caroll, Charlotte Br\u00f6nte and\nGeorge Eliot.\nThe funds generated by the successful\nExhibition were used to open the South\nKensington Museum in 1857, which went\non to become the V&A, the Science\nMuseum and the Natural History\nMuseum. This neighbourhood just south\nof where The Exhibition took place was\nconsequently given the nickname of\nAlbertopolis. Imperial College, however,\nwas not yet in existence as we know it\ntoday; in its place stood the Imperial\nInstitute. The only thing that remains\nof the Imperial Institute today is the\nQueen\u2019s Tower.\nThe land on which Imperial College\nnow sits also existed once as a collection\nof landscaped gardens created by the\nHorticultural Society, where other\nopenland exhibitions were also held.\nToday, Exhibition Road and its\nsurrounding area is where the Royal\nCollege of Art; English National Ballet;\nRoyal Albert Hall; Royal Geographical\nSociety and the Serpentine Gallery,\namongst many others, are to be found.\nThe original motto \u2018Arts and Science\u2019,\ngiven to the area by the Commissioners\nfor the Exhibition, can still be seen on\nsome of the surviving buildings which\ninclude the Royal Albert Hall and the\nV&A.\nFrom this road, one may even choose\nbetween going for a nibble on anything\nfrom frozen yoghurt to sushi or curry;\na spot of ice-skating to embrace the\nChristmasmood,followedbysometoasty\nmulled wine; or, if not in favour of the\nphysicalexertionthatskatingmightentail,\nsimply choose to enjoy a film, whether it\nbe in French or in 3D.

The\nU23 elite lightweight sculler takes the\ntitle from last year\u2019s winner GB sculler\nAlan Campbell. Imperial won four\npennants, had five 2nd placings, and\nthree 3rd placings as well as nearly all\nIC competitors finishing in the top 10\nin their categories.\nBig Deal status (more difficult to\nachieve than an MBE) has officially\nbeen bestowed upon Newcastle Upon\nTyne\u2019s Jamie Kirkwood; a first for the\nNorth. Starting at number 115 Kirkwood set out to get a good placing\nfor next year\u2019s head race, which he\nclaimed he would win. The 20 year old\nlightweight far-exceeded all expectations by clocking the fastest time of the\nday (20:55.38), over 8 seconds ahead\nof runner-up R. Dunley of London\nRC. IC\u2019s George Whittaker had the\nhonour of starting the race in respect\nof his overall win in 2007 and fourth\nplace finish in 2008. Whittaker placed\nthird overall this year taking a pen-nant, much to the delight of 19 year\nold fresher Rory Sullivan who placed\nan impressive 5th overall and had to\nsettle for 2nd in the same category.\nIn 13th place overall was IC\u2019s German lightweight Ole Tietz who claimed\nthe novice pennant last year. Imperial\nmanaged to retain the pennant thanks\nto Henry Goodier who finished 19th\noverall. Also racing for the novice\npennant was Trapmore\u2019s former glory\ndays crewmate Dan Ouseley whose\ncompetitive record includes a World\nBronze Medal in 2003 and 2001 as well\nas competing in the 2004 Athens Olympics. Ouseley finished 73rd overall\nand 5th in the novice category; which\nhas untold comforting effects for Officer Duffy who finished 7th in Women\u2019s Novice category\nThere was tough competition in the\nlightweight IM2.1x category with Alex\nGillies (who placed 24th overall this\nyear compared to 59th in 2008) missing out on a pennant by a mere 0.02\nseconds to Berridge of London RC.\nIC\u2019s Andy Gordon finished a respectable 4th in category and 35th overall; 9\nplaces higher than last year\u2019s race. With\nthe IM3.1x pennant assumed a Whittaker shoe-in, the race for place was\non. Highlander Johnny Rankin claimed\n7th (43rd overall) followed by chest infected Ben Anstiss who coughed home\nin 22nd (115th overall).\nIn the women\u2019s squad Rachael\n\u2018Chewy\u2019 Davies took the honour of\nfastest IC girl (148th overall) as well\nas fourth fastest lightweight in the\nentire head race. She claimed the pennant in a blistering time of 22:57. Davies has never lost a category pennant\nin the three times she has entered the\nSculler\u2019s Head of the River. Appearing\nat training on Sunday morning Chewy\nwas disappointed at the absence of\nwomen\u2019s coach Brian Steele; \u201cI wanted to abuse him.\u201d A still intoxicated\nChewster went on to announce her\nlegendary status to anyone who would\nlisten before sculling off into the distance on her \u201crecovery paddle\u201d past\nUL. She was not seen again for another\ntwo hours and was still hyper upon\nher return. Women\u2019s Captain Mathilde\nPauls came 2nd in category (W.ELI.1x)\nand 173rd overall. Zoe Lee, representing the newly formed Sport Imperial\nclub for non-student members, finished 3rd and 182nd overall.\nIt was the battle of the Smith sisters in the W.IM2.1x category as IC\u2019s\nRo Smith was pitted against older sister Nicky. Nicky has won two Henley\nmedals representing IC. She recently\nmade the move from Imperial to Oxford and was racing for City of Oxford\nat this year\u2019s Scullers\u2019 Head. Nicky,\nstarting last in her category, overtook\nall other scullers but could not catch\nRo who led the category out.

Despite the 5:30 (am) wake\nup call, everyone was in high spirits,\nand determined to keep the success of\nthe season so far going. With the men\nunbeaten and the women (mostly) un-beaten, the expectations were high for\nboth teams.\nFirst up on court were the women\u2019s\nteam captained by Linda Vaccari, playing the hosts. Imperial, suffering from\nsleep deprivation, lost the first set\nto a team that rarely threatened, but\nforced Imperial into mistakes. However things perked up in the second set,\nhelped by some amazing hits by new\nteam member Monica Luegmair.\nIn the deciding third set, both teams\nexchanged points, but some consistent\nand effective serves from club captain\nAshly Black gave Imperial the edge,\nand they won the final set 16-14.\nNext on court were the Men\u2019s team,\nplaying the University of Essex. Despite the incredible volleyball on display in the warm-up, all eyes were on\ncaptain Marc Schaepertoens\u2018 shorts,\na rather fetching women\u2019s pair in size\nsmall (see photo).\nThe men starting strongly helped\nby consistently powerful jump serving\nfrom Alessandro Galli and solid defensive play from Marios Chartosias, and\nwon the first set 25-17. The second set\nhowever was a slightly different story,\nand so the game went to a deciding\nthird set. Some effective quick attacks\nfrom new addition to the team Nikaloas Nikolaou allowed Imperial to win\nthe set 15-11 and so the match.\nAfter a three hour break, both\nteams were back on court, providing\ncoach Ercu with a dilemma of who to\nsupport.

Happy 60TH birthday Felix!\nCopyright \u00a9 Felix 2009.\nT\nhe population of the newly founded State of Israel surpassed\n800,000 this month, but tensions remain with Arab neighbours.\nThe one-year old nation continues to grow as Jews from across\nEurope and nearby Arab states immigrate to Israel. Earlier this\nyear, the country ended the Arab-Israeli war after defeating a\nforce assembled from several of its Arab neighbours, including Egypt, Syria,\nTransjordan, Iraq and Lebanon, and signing an armistice in March. The victory has not only secured Israel\u2019s independence, but also increased the land\nunder its control by almost 50% above what had been agreed by the UN partition plan passed two years ago.\nThis month, the Knesset, the legislative arm of Israel\u2019s government, relocated from Tel-Aviv to Jerusalem, which is still divided between the Israeli west\nand Palestinian east. Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion who was elected in\nFebruary continues to push ahead with his national policies of rapid development and rising population by attracting Jews from across the world to Israel.\nBeyond College walls:\n60 years ago\nBy Raphael Houdmont, International Editor\nT\nhis week, two\nmillion Nationalist Chinese\nof the defeated\nKuomintang\n(KMT) successfully retreated\nto the island of Taiwan, leaving only small pockets of resistance to the communists on\nthe mainland.\nThe Chinese civil war is\ncoming to an end after years\nof fighting between the nationalists and the communists which had resulted\nover 1.2 million military casualties since the Japanese defeat at the end of\nWorld War II. Civilian deaths amounted to many times this number. In early\nDecember, Chiang Kai-shek, leader of the KMT, proclaimed Taipei the temporary capital of the Republic of China, and continued to assert his government as the sole legitimate authority in China.\nAfter a string of heavy defeats in north and central China earlier in the year,\nand the communist capture of Nanjing, seat of the Republic of China\u2019s gov-ernment, the KMT were progressively repelled to the southern shores of the\ncountry. In October, Mao Zedong declared the establishment of the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China and moved its capital to Beijing.\nRepublic of China\nT\nhe Berlin blockade ended three months ago after a hugely successful airlift operation by the Allies, but over three month\u2019s\nworth of supplies have been amassed in West Germany, ensuring\nthat the airlift could be restarted with ease if needed.\nThe blockade, which lasted for a total of 18 months up until\nSeptember this year, saw a total of 2,326,406 tons of food and supplies delivered aboard 278,228 flights to Berlin by the USA and the UK\u2019s RAF. The airlift\ncost approximately $224 million, and saw over 100 fatalities, mostly British\nand American, due to crashes.\nThe crisis was the first which resulted from tensions between the West and\nthe USSR after the end of the World War. The airlift commenced after the Soviets blocked railways leading into West Berlin, in an attempt to force western\npowers to allow the Soviet-controlled zone (East Berlin) to be allowed to start\nsupplying the western part of the city with food and supplies, effectively giving control of the city to East Germany.\nWest Germany\nIsrael\nP\nrofessor Sir Leszek Borysiewicz, former Deputy Rector\nof Imperial College and current Chief Executive of the\nMedical Research Council, has been nominated as the next\nVice-Chancellor of the University of\nCambridge.\nProfessor Borysiewicz joined Imperial in 2001 as Principal of the Faculty\nof Medicine before becoming Deputy\nRector in 2004.\nHe is one of the country\u2019s most respected medical researchers, and will\ncommence his position at Cambridge\nas the successor of Professor Alison\nRichard at the end of her seven year\nterm on October 1st 2010.

We will only be\nmaking slight changes to the Union Bar to\nmodernise the lighting and some light re-decoration.\nThe nightclub, dB\u2019s, will be a completely\nblank slate with lots of extra space: we hope\nto create a bigger, better venue with a more\nefficient design. We need your feedback\nand ideas to help our architects design the\nbest space for you. Our bar/cafe da Vinci\u2019s\nwill also be completely refurbished to better\nutilise the space and make services more\nefficient.\nBelow we have included a plan of the ground\nfloor of the building with the space in both\ndB\u2019s and da Vinci\u2019s that we can utilise during\nthese works marked in red. We would really\nlike you to cut this out and sketch your ideas\non it. Think about where the bars could go,\nwhere we would put catering and where\nwe would put the stage in dB\u2019s. The space\nbehind da Vinci\u2019s will be the cellar so that has\nto stay as it is. In dB\u2019s there are unfortunately\nload baring walls to take into account\nwhich cannot be removed! Once you have\ncompleted your sketch hand it in to Union\nReception, floor 2M of the Union Building,\nemail it to dpfs@imperial.ac.uk or post it to\nus.\nWe are still finalising the exact project plan,\nbut we are currently aiming at minimal\ndisruption to our bars, catering and nightclub\nuntil the end of the academic year. The major\nworks will be completed over the summer\nwith the new venues ready for October and\nFreshers\u2019 Week 2010.\nRemember: it\u2019s your Union, so tell us what\nyou want, whether you currently use our\nbars or not. We will continue to keep you\nup-to-date on this project as it continues on a\nspecial area of our website and in Felix. Next\nweek we will open a survey to collect more\nof your ideas, with some prizes to be won as\nwell. Please do take the time to let us know\nwhat you want, we have the opportunity to\ncreate something really special for you and\nfuture generations of students!\nThe Wave\nSATURDAY 5th December\nMeet at 12.00 in Beit Quad with your banners\nFor more info\nvisit our website\nimperialcollegeunion.org/green\nor the-wave.org.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Turns out 1949 was a\ngood year to be born\nif you wanted to be a\nmega rockstar\nMUSIC\nMusic Editors: Alexandra Ashford, Kadhim Shubber & Luke Turner\nOnline Editor: Christopher Walmsley\nmusic.felix@gmail.com www.felixmusic.tk\nTunes that thou listened to in 1949\nReviews\nfrom 1949 Imagine the comments you would have\nto put up with if your surname was\nHooker! It obviously didn\u2019t get in the\nway of John Lee Hooker, who achieved\nmoderate success with this song in\n1949. His soulful vocals and twanging\nelectric guitar jamming are the perfect of example of what makes blues a\ngenre that has persisted all these years.\nThe lyrics mostly consist of \u201cI\u2019m a\nhobo, gone long way from home\u201d. I\u2019ve\nrealised while doing these reviews, just\nhow much better black people were\nat making music than white people\nin 1949. All the white people music\nsucks. \u2013 Alexandra Ashford\nIt seems as though, in the U.S.A. in\n1949, everything was exactly like a\nwestern film and everybody was a\ncowboy and liked to listen to songs\nthat sound like steam railways with\nwhip crack and horse galloping sound\neffects, and lyrics that mostly go,\n\u201cyeeeha, giddy up!\u201d. I\u2019m reviewing this\nsong but all the most popular songs of\n1949 sound exactly like this. As crap as\nit is, it\u2019s about a million times more listenable than the current U.K. number\n1 (Peter Kay\u2019s Animated All Star Band\n\u2013 Children in Need 2009 \u2013 by the way\nthat isn\u2019t satirical, that really is the current U.K. number 1 single.\n\u2013 Alexandra Ashford\nFRANKIE LAINE\nMULE TRAIN\nSINGLE\nAccording to music critics, this is the\nbest album released in 1949. It has that\ncompletely unmelodic fidgety pulse of\nbebop and I find it hard to imagine\nanyone but the biggest jazz geeks listening to it. I can picture them now,\ndiscussing in great detail the technical\nnuances, what \u201ccool\u201d means, and ways\nin which this album is unparalleled\ngenius. Personally, if I want to feel a\nbit geeky, I\u2019d rather just listen to Radiohead. \u2013 Alexandra Ashford\nLEE KONITZ\nSUBCONCIOUS\nALBUM\nJOHN LEE\nHOOKER\nBOOGIE CHILLEN\u2019\nSINGLE\nVAUGHN\nMONROE\nGHOST RIDERS IN\nTHE SKY\nSINGLE\nVIC DAMONE\nYOU\u2019RE\nBREAKING MY\nHEART\nSINGLE\nGENE AUTRY\nRUDOLPH THE\nRED-NOSED\nREINDEER\nSINGLE\nI can imagine a really old couple\nputting this on the record player, holding hands and shuffling around the living room to this. Aww. I cannot believe this was the fourth biggest selling\nsingle of 1949. \u2013 Alexandra Ashford\nPERRY COMO\nSOME\nENCHANTED\nEVENING\nSINGLE\nThis was pretty much Rhianna\u2019s \u2018Umbrella\u2019 of 1949; boring but still at\nnumber 1 for an insane amout of time.\nNumber 1 throughout the world, this\nought to be the theme tune of every\ncowboy as they ride into the sunset\nhowling \u2018yipee-ay yay\u2019. It\u2019s definitely not\nas bad as Rhianna... In fact I\u2019ve learned\nto like it, but nowadays it should only\nbe heard with its video accompani-ment, trippy stuff. With the galloping horse sounds and honey voice of\nVaughn Monroe, it is the deserved\nsoundtrack to 1949. \u2013 Luke Turner\nThe iconic song from Edith Piaf, was\npopularised in 1946 and chart topping\nin 1949. Known as France\u2019s greatest\npopular singer, this was some of the\nmost influential on modern music to\ncome from 1949 \u2013 Luke Turner\nEDITH PIAF\nLA VIE EN ROSE\nSINGLE\nRainy night. Warm coat. Silky voice.\nA broken heart. Vic was the perfect\nmusic. It really is on the boring side of\n1949 but if depression over lost love is\nwhat rocks your boat. \u2013 Luke Turner\nOh yes, 1949 was the year Rudolph hit\nthe big time in his musical form. This\nhas been the first x-mas song I\u2019ve heard\nthis year which means I can\u2019t say a bad\nword. Not originally written by Gene,\nit cruised to x-mas number 1, becoming the second biggest selling x-mas\nsong of all time. Following this Gene\nbecame known as \u2018the singing cowboy\u2019,\nwhich doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, and\nbecame the only person with 5 stars on\nHollywood. \u2013 Luke Turner\nOkay so it wasn\u2019t that long ago but seriously 1949\u2019s music is pretty much unrecognizable, Alex Ashford reports\nGene Simmons\n- 25th August\nBruce\nSpringsteen\n- 23rd Sept\nTom Waits\n- 7th Dec\nI\n\u2019m so glad I wasn\u2019t around in\n1949, because pretty much all\nthere was to listen to was jazz\n(the musical equivalent of amateur improv. drama shows) and\nmusic that sounds like it is from a cowboy film. They hadn\u2019t even invented\nthe keyboard yet, let alone synthesiz-ers, mixers, autotune and music video\ngirls. The electric guitar was only just\nbeing picked up on, and even then it\nwas for playing jazz. People had yet to\nrealize that playing in 4/4 as opposed\nto 3/4 and 6/8 would create rock & roll:\nthe most popular kind of music since\nthe days of Beethoven and Mozart.\nDespite not having the Cartoons, Peter Kay, or Wheatus, 1949 still saw the\nrelease of some of the most annoying\nsongs of all time. Songs like \u201cI\u2019ve got\na lovely bunch of coconuts\u201d and \u201cAll\nI want for Christmas is my two front\nteeth\u201d are still remembered now, by ladies with a blue rinse in nursing homes\nworldwide.\nBut not everyone listened to such\nsimple ditties. 1949 was the year Miles\nDavis released his seminal album, \u201cthe\nBirth of Cool\u201d. And with that, jazz\nbecame cool. It\u2019s the jazz you smoke\ncigarettes and drink red wine to in\nNew York bars. Trumpets were sweeping exclamations over deep, deep, bass\ntones, punctuated with the tingle of a\nhi-hat and the snap of a snare drum.\nThis is the sort of music that you can\nimagine listening to as you hang out\nin dimly lit attics with characters like\nSal Paradise, taking now unknown\ndrugs and living just on the edge of the\nBeat Generation. Miles Davis wasn\u2019t\nthe only musical genius pushing jazz\nin new directions. Thelonious Monk\ninvented bebop, the definitive sound\nof the era. Lee Konitz released the\nhighly critically acclaimed bebop jazz\nalbum, Subconcious.\nHowever, the truth is, I know nothing about jazz and for me to try to\nwrite about it it\u2019s like having an Austrian, body-building, action movie star\ngoverning one of the most influential\nstates of America. Oh wait... bad ex-ample. But all I\u2019m trying to emphasize\nis how far removed I am, with the music we have now, from what was being\nplayed in 1949.\nThe amount music has changed over\nthe past 60 years is so unfathomable, I\nwonder whether the same will be able\nto be said in 60 years to come.\nHANK WILLIAMS\nI\u2019M SO\nLONESOME I\nCOULD CRY\nSINGLE\nHank is so lonesome he could cry. With\ntalent like this he doesn\u2019t deserve to be\nlonesome. Love him. \u2013 Luke Turner\n15\nfelix FRIDAY 04 DECEMBER 2009\n\n"

    "content": "8\nCOMMENT\nComment Editor Ravi Pall\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfelix FRIDAY 04 DECEMBER 2009\nI\nrealised at a young age that my\nlife ambition was to be a Renaissance Man. My first steps were\nobviously to change my name\nto Leonardo and grow a long\nwhite beard, but after an unfortunately\n\u2018barbe\u2019d confrontation with school bullies I had to cut all of that. Since then,\nI can\u2019t claim that I\u2019ve yet been apprenticed by any 15th\ncentury Italian paint-ers, as would have been ideal, or even\nthat my knowledge of anything is particularly profound. Certainly I haven\u2019t\nreached anything like the stunning level\nof cultivation displayed on Monday by\nthe University Challenge team. However, I vaguely cling to my unrealistic\ngoal. While we may not achieve prodigious understanding, we can still take\nan interest.\nLast week, Dan Wan told us that Imperial students don\u2019t work as long as\nOxbridge students. Isn\u2019t that wonderful?\nAnd obviously all that free time is also\nthe reason that Imperial is renowned for\nits veritable army of Renaissance men\nand women. After all, while arts are accessible without specialised training, science is largely not, so for the truly well-educated we\u2019re looking for scientifically\nliterate young people with time to burn in\na cultural capital. So far, so good; except\nof course, that Imperial\u2019s reputation is not\none of an artistic and political hotbed.\nSo, where is this polymath potential\ndraining to? How is it that young scientists with a lot of time on their hands\n(yes, quit moaning: 11.3 hours a week\nfor starters) and access to all the artistic\nstimulation you could hope for are not\nknown for the power of their myriad in-terests? Why are the tiny political societies unvocal and inactive? How have the\nTV and radio of Imperial slipped so far\nfrom their heyday that most don\u2019t even\nknow they exist? Why isn\u2019t Imperial\nrenowned for its graduates as well informed as Healy, Good, Amit, Nicolson\nand Brightman?\nIt appears it can be put down to our\ngeneral apathy. Reflected all too often in\nthese felicitous pages is a mood of complaint and an acute lack of pride in being\nfrom Imperial, manifested especially in\nThe Imperial Stereotype, also known as\n\u201cOh Please Not That Again\u201d and \u201cFlogging a Dead Horse Much?\u201d, which is\ndraped liberally around like pre-emptory\nChristmas lighting. And we don\u2019t understand why student satisfaction is low?\nI believe that the apathy which causes\nlack of interest in the wider world is responsible for lack of community pride as\nwell. Better; I think it can be changed.\nThe more fascination that you can\nmuster in the outside world, the more\nyou can enjoy, and feel enriched by your\nundergraduate years. If, after an investigation (which they surely deserve) of\nthese other worldly delights, you develop the informed opinion that you\nwouldn\u2019t touch the non-scientific world\nwith a bargepole, then you can go back\nand relish, nay, glory in spending ridiculous amounts of time at your studies.\nI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m urging anyone towards community pride, a revolting\nphrase I have been avoiding my whole\nlife. It conjures up for me the image of\njingoistic songs, flags and cliquey ho-mogeneity, but lacking it has made me\nrealise what it really is. Self-esteem is\nmissing from students here, and the\ndesire to stand up for the good name of\nthe college.\nStudents of every other university in\nthe land boast wildly about their own\ninstitutions and complaints are secondary to a hyperbolic assertion that it is,\nwithout a doubt, the best place to be. In\nfact, this sort of behaviour can only be\nfound here within a group whose community pride is matched only by the\nsheer activity of clubs and societies, and\nwillingness to sing the praises of their\nown faculty. I\u2019m talking of course about\nthe medics. Why is it then that they are\ntreated with such disregard by everyone\nelse? Perhaps because they have found\na way to ignore the Imperial apathy and\ndisinterest, and cultivate the self-confi-dence which would be so dearly treasured by all the rest.\nIf arts students be the required tools\nfor an atmosphere of intellectual ex-citement, it\u2019s defeatist to think it can\u2019t\nbe done without them. You have all the\noutlets of an arts student here, and only\nhere can science students easily take\nadvantage of them. Make the most of it!\nRox Middleton\u2019s childhood dream?\n\u201c...all that free\ntime is the reason\nthat Imperial\nis renowned\nfor its army of\nRenaissance men\nand women\u201d\nI\nf I\u2019m honest, I don\u2019t like Al Qaeda,\nor Nick Griffin, and, in my opinion,\nHitler was not a nice man. Quite an\neclectic bunch, you might think; in-deed, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find them\nall around a table, enjoying a cheeky pint\nat the Union, any time soon. Of course,\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone in my dislike of\nthese people, these extremists if you\nwill \u2013 they\u2019re all quite reprehensible. But\nthe reason for my particular aversion to\nthem is unique. I don\u2019t hate them because\nthey\u2019re extremists; I hate them because\nthey give extremists a bad name.\nAnd this is a tragedy! It was reported\nrecently that the first person to live to\ntwo-hundred is already living today but,\nwith a diet consisting of curry, pasta,\nand \u201cother\u201d, washed down with Snakebite and tequila, in between a pattern of\nwork and...more work in the time previously designated for sleep, I severely\ndoubt that person is going to be me, or\nanyone at Imperial. Which is why it is vital that we make the most of today! When\nHorace said Carpe Diem, he didn\u2019t just\nmean stroke the day or gently fondle it \u2013\nhe meant seize the day with passion and\nzealandshakeitdownforallit\u2019sgot!Lifeis\nto be enjoyed and if we only have so long,\nwe have to get as much enjoyment in as\npossible.\nBut in Britain today, this just doesn\u2019t\nhappen. This is partly due to the extremists listed above, which I detest them for,\nbut it\u2019s also an innate quality of the people.\nThis is a lukewarm nation. It is not in our\nnature to push the envelope. The British\ndo not complain (with the notable exception of the weather), they do not dance if\nthere is even the slightest chance there are\npeople watching and they certainly do not\ndrink milk a day past the expiration date.\nOur ancestors must have selectively bred\nfor politeness, though for the life of me I\ncan\u2019t think why.\nNow, I must stress this isn\u2019t necessarily\na bad thing. The comfortable 28mph lives\nof the many mean that those few extre-mophiles, those golden children of sport,\npolitics and culture, really do stand out.\nThis is why Olympic gold medals and Nobel prizes still mean something; they only\ngo to the outstanding among us.\nI\u2019m not alone in wanting to live an extreme life. Pepsi\u2019s slogan for their Pepsi\nMax is \u201cMaximum taste \u2013 no sugar.\u201d Their\nadverts show people pushing past the\nboundaries of madness and public decency to reach that sugar-free, caffeinated\nsoft drink at the end. Still, I don\u2019t think an\nenthusiastic, optimistic approach to an\nempty, uncaring universe is quite on the\nsame level as coke but at least the sponsorship pays well.\nThis aversion to the extreme, this desire to lie within the statistical average,\nalthough a trait of the nation, isn\u2019t something you grow up with \u2013 it\u2019s something\nyou grow into. Consider, a newborn baby\nin their mother\u2019s arms. All the family\ngather round and make silly noises and\nsay \u201cOh, isn\u2019t he special!\u201d But within a\nfew years, special takes on a very different\nmeaning. \u201cOh, you\u2019ll have to excuse him,\nhe\u2019s a bit...special.\u201d At some point during\nour life, we transition from the masters of\nour own universe to just being another\nface in the crowd. And worse still, we\u2019re\nhappy with this! No, children have the\nright idea; they don\u2019t dream about telemarketing from a four foot by four foot\ncubicle, they dream about being knights\nand explorers and secret agents. If they\nwant to be a cowboy-astronaut with a\ncape, they\u2019re bloody well going to be one,\ndespite what anyone tells them. Children\ndon\u2019t settle for mediocre, they don\u2019t settle\nof second-best, so why should we?\nI think the point I am vaguely approaching in my roundabout fashion is\nmost succinctly summarised in the film,\nWALL-E. When the rogue autopilot defends its actions by saying it acted to ensure humanity\u2019s survival, the captain of\nthe Axiom replies with a heart-rending\nplea, \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to survive \u2013 I want\nto live.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s all I have to say. Live each\nday as if it\u2019s your last (and with the way\ntaxis drive in London, that is a distinct\npossibility). I started off by talking about\nterrorists and finished with a whimsical animated film. What kind of article\nwould do that? An extreme one! Woo!\nRhys Davies to the max and/or extreme\n\u201cThe British do\nnot complain, they\ndo not dance if\nthere are people\nwatching, and do\nnot drink milk past\nexpiration\u201d\n\n"

Either way, it\u2019s the\n60th Anniversary and us editors now\nhave to theme our sections and pretend we\u2019re celebrating something.\n1949\nDr Hubert Alfenstead, an Imperial researcher in biological warfare created the\nfirst Imperial student newspaper to promotehisevilplans.Henamedthepaper\u2018Dr\nHubertAlfensted\u2019sevilstudentnewspaper\u2019\n.\nWhat you\u2019ve read in this paper up until now is complete bullshit. Here\u2019s the real history of this dump of a paper\nAnonymous Hangman Editor\nThe Beginner\u2019s Guide to the history of felix\nTwo weeks later, Alfenstead was arrested for conspiracy to eradicate the human\nrace. He had manufactured a virus that,\nas quoted from his student newspaper,\n\u2018makes peoplereallyreallyangry.\u2019Director\nDanny Boyle later used this angry virus\nas the premise for his 2002 film, \u201828 Days\nLater\u2019\n.\nWhen asked why he published his evil\nplans for students to read, Alfenstead said\nthat to be truly evil, one must be openly\nevil. He believed that Imperial students\ndeserved to know just how evil he was.\nAlfenstead was sentenced to death by\nhanging. It would seem that his open evil-ness had cost him his life. However, he\nfamously escaped death by blaming it all\non the cat.\nAlfenstead explained how his cat\nfelix, had held him at gunpoint and\nforced him to synthesize the virus\nand divulge the evil plans in a student\nnewspaper. The judge apologised\nprofusely and passed the sentence\nonto Alftenstead\u2019s cat. \u2018Dr Hubert Alfenstead\u2019s evil student newspaper\u2019 was\nthen renamed to \u2018Felix\u2019 in honour of\nhis scapecat. (this witty take on the\nword scapegoat would have been hilarious in 1949).\nThere is debate over where the name\nfelix, or the cat logo came from, but\nhangman can assure you that this is\nthe correct story! Hangman was also\nnamed after the hanging of Felix,\nhence the picture above.\n1965\nThe Sixties. A defining era that saw us\nput our old english traditions aside and\nwelcome a colourful world of drugs,\ncasual sex and the Beatles.\nIt unfortunately also saw the rise in\nfeminism and women started to genuinely believe that they could, well,\ndo stuff. This included reading and\nwriting.\nIn 1965, to the dismay of felix\u2019s male\nreaders, the paper saw its first female\nunion.ic.ac.uk/acc/football\neditor, Brigette Downs.\nDowns started preaching her hippie\nnonsense about world peace and started drawing flowers on every page in an\nattempt to pacify any angry readers.\nFlowers, up until this point, had always been regarded as masculine and\nevil. Dr Alfenstead put flowers on\ngraves as an image of mockery. People\nnow do this as a message of respect.\nThe male population of Imperial retaliated against Brigette Downs with\nthe one thing they held dear to them\n-felix. That\u2019s right, they coiled up the\nfolded sheets of hippie jargon and\nstarted beating the shit out of every female Imperial student.\nThe Great Felix Vagina Cleansing of\n1965 saw Imperial College become a\nmale-only university. The Police force\neven took inspiration and made trun-cheons, akin to the rolled up newspa-pers, to combat hippie protestors.\n1979\nYou\u2019ve just bought your microwave,\nVHS recorder and first pair of Levi\u2019s.\nNothing can get in your way. That is\nuntil Maggie Thatcher comes along\nand rules your country. Your VHS recorder has just been ruined forever.\nSexyOsama69\nOMGZ! Trial is soooo boring *yawn*. I told\ndem dat 9/11 was a joke. They dont get it lol\nBarack_attack_l33thaxor\nLOL! I get it!\nSUPERACEGORTHEROAR87\n:o U cant make jokes bout 9/11!

Ur just jealous Gor coz ur prime minister\nand ur not allowed to blow up trains\nWith a woman in power, it seemed\nthat Britain was really starting to accept\nwomen as equals. Likewise, Imperial\nCollege saw a rise, albeit a small rise,\nin female students. The male-to-female\nratio has still not recovered from the\nGreat Vagina Cleansing of 1965.\nOn July 1st 1979, Thatcher controversially tried to censor felix, worried\nthat its global influence was growing\nout of hand. It has been speculated that\nthe Soviets invaded Afghanistan just to\ntry and out-evil Dr Alfenstead. This rumour is yet to be confirmed.\nfelix stood firm, insisting that they\nwould always have freedom of speech\nand would not be censored, \u2018Keep the\ncat free\u2019. As a radical backlash and\nshow of power, felix decided to sponsor the Eighties. Yeah, that\u2019s right - the\nEighties.\nSo before you pick up a copy of felix\nand think it\u2019s just an average student\nnewspaper. You remember that it was\nonce a symbol of evil, a weapon for\nbeating women and sponsor of the\nEighties. Felix the cat died for evilness\nand every time you put flowers on a\ngrave you are insulting that cat and everything it stood for. Hangman is grateful for your dedicated page skipping,\nbut does not tolerate ignorance. A cat\ndied for your rights.\nSUPERACEGORTHEROAR87\nSTFU Osie! I cud blow up train if I want.

The model, muse and style\nicon says, \u201cI advocate glamour. Every\nday. Every minute.\u201d\nThis season, the bright, cinematic\nspotlight of glamour shone over the\nA/W 2009-10 catwalks at Dolce and\nGabbana, Alber Elbaz at Lanvin and\nChristian Dior Couture. Clear references were made to the 40s as luxe furs,\nsilks and rich brocades were worked\ninto narrow, chic silhouettes and\npaired with elaborate milli-24\nFASHION\nFashion Editor Kawai Wong\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfelix FRIDAY 04 DECEMBER 2009\nA\nn injucntion from 2008 dictates that eBay is banned\nfrom selling goods from\nthe LVMH empire on its\nFrench website. LVMH is a\nluxurygiantthatownsLouisVuitton,Dior,\nFendi and Givenchy - just to name a few.\nThis Tuesday, a Paris court judge\nruled that eBay had breached the injunction by not blocking sales of LVMH\nproducts on its site. eBay was fined \u00a31.5\nmillion. LVMH\u2019s move to ban sales of its\ngoods on eBay is to prevent the sale of\ncouterfeit products and also to ensure\nthat the brands\u2019 products are distributed via franchised vendors. The latter\nis worrying because this has opened the\ndoor for big corporate companies to\nseize control over the marketplace. This\nepisode has also highlighted the fragility\nof independent designers when it comes\nto defending their authentic creations.\nWhile rich companies like LVMH can\nrage a lawsuit against anyone; what prevents corporate clothing chains from\nripping off designs of young designers\nwho don\u2019t even have the strength to\ncomplain about the misconduct?\nTake Erdem for example. His au-tumn/ winter 09 collection featured\nsplashed water-coloured floral printed\nskirts and dresses. Four months later a\nLegal\nplagiarism\nKawai Wong Fashion Editor\nsimilar design with a similar print appeared on Primark\u2019s shelves with a \u00a312\nprice tag. If you look at H&M\u2019s shop\nwindow now, you can see a mannequin\ndonning a rose-pink puffy tulle skirt\nthat is reminiscent of Giles Deacon\u2019s\nblack tulle petticoat, as seen in his show\nback in September. Plaigiarism on the\nhigh street seems to be an unstoppable\nplague. Yesterday, I walked into an Aldo\nand was shocked to to see the number\nof shoes on the shelves that exude an\nuncanny similarity to Giuseppe Zanotti\nand Christian Louboutin\u2019s original de-signs. In Aldo, there\u2019s a Stemper shoe\nwhich is embellished with rainbow coloured crystals. In Zanotti, there\u2019s also a\nrainbow coloured Swarovski crystal ankle boot. Only that Aldo sports a \u00a3600\ndiscount on this \u2018alternative design\u2019\n.\nFor Giles and Erdem who seem to have\nplanted their feet firmly on the ground,\nthe impact of \u2018legal corporate plagiarism\u2019\nmay not be as hard hit as it is to any fresh\ngraduate designers. But plagiarism on\nthe high street seems to be a contagious\nplague that is unstoppable.\nFor fresh designers, they barely have\nany money to buy materials. It hurts to\nsee these young talents struggle, while\nthese multi-billion pound companies\nrake it in with counterfeit designs.\nFrom left: Opera leather gloves, ASOS, \u00a330; pearl embellished bolero,\nTopshop, \u00a3125; mary-jane shoes, Manolo Blahnik, vintage. Alber Elbaz\nfor Lanvin, AW09 collection; Dita von Teese in a jacket resembling the\n1951 Balenciaga balloon sleeves design.\nSaskiaVerhagen Fashion Writer\nRenaissance of Glamour\nY\near 1949: with endings come\nthe brightest beginnings.\nJust two years after Japan\u2019s\nsurrender documents were\nsigned on the USS Missouri, Christian\nDior revealed his 6 mannequins draped\nin yards of extravagant materials; the\nfull, below calf-length skirts and nar-row, tailored jackets later chronicled in\nfashion history as the \u201cNew Look\u201d.\nDior gave no quarter to the idea that\ncutbacks and timidity should have\nbeen the order of the day in times of\npost-war fabric rationing; instead he\nwas to spawn a generation of silver\nscreen icons to be remembered for\ntheir pristine, lavish glamour, both on\nand off-screen.\nVivien Leigh was one of them, an\nactress most commonly remembered\nfor her Oscar-winning performances\nas Scarlett O\u2019Hara in Gone With The\nWind and Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire. Leigh embodied the\nimmaculate, refined look of the time\nin silhouettes defined by a tiny waist.\nThe wide shoulders and A-line skirts\nfashionable at the time served the sole\npurpose to bestow upon the wearer the\nillusion of an unspeakably\nminus\u201cElbaz combined\na silk blouse in the\npalest latt\u00e9 with\nblack gloves, a neat\nmatching pencil\nskirt and swathed it\nall in a stole.\u201d\nnery, clean, porcelain skin, neatly lined\neyes and pillow-soft matte red lips.\nA look I personally favoured was\nseen at Lanvin: Elbaz combined a silk\nblouse in the palest latt\u00e9 with black\nleather opera-length gloves, a neat\nmatching pencil skirt and swathed it all\nin an ultimately luxurious red fox stole.\nA true homage to the classic chic of the\n40s: sumptuous materials transformed\ninto a functional combination fit for a\nHollywood screen goddess.\nIf your wardrobe is craving a bit of\nglitz and glamour, look no further than\nyour nearest vintage boutique for a\nfew 40s originals. Scour out the light\nsilk blouses, full skirts complete with\nmillefeuillecrinolines, jaunty feathered\nhats and look out for stoles, capes and\ncollars in mink, sable and fox \u2013 or faux,\nif fur isn\u2019t your thing. For those of you\nlooking for an easier fix than trawling through malodorous racks of old\nclothes in amongst the teenyboppers\nwho seem to now frequent such vintage outlets, both Topshop and ASOS\nhave the answer: elbow-length gloves,\nluxurious embellished jackets and\nwide corset belts are just a few mouse\nclicks away. There\u2019s no pride in having\ntaken only 5 minutes to get out of the\nhouse \u2013 if you want to have every head\nturn as you strut down Queen\u2019s Gate,\ntake an extra minute to polish off your\nlook with a touch of 40s glamour.\n\n"

There\u2019s two techniques\nyou could do; ask her to take a dump\nbefore hand and narrow your chances\nof infection, but this comes with mental\nimagery and the fact that she actually\nhas to take a shit.

Last week,\na rather engorged lady entered the\nshop, followed by a vile penetrating\npong of BO layers, ranging from this\nmorning to about 3 years ago. She\nwas looking to get a bra fitting and as\nthe most senior member of staff the\ntask fell to me, much to the amusement of my colleagues.\nI braced myself and led her tearfully\ninto the most ventilated fitting room.\nI wanted to minimise skin contact so\nasked her to lift her breasts up. This\nwas followed by a thud. On the floor\nlay a whole piece of stale bread and\nseveral cheese and onion crisps. I\nam mentally scarred and haven\u2019t\nbeen to work since. Please help,\nJosephine Russet\nDear Josephine,\nYou probably need to get a new job\nor hunt her down and power hose her\nuntil till she realises her effect on oth-ers. This could be counted as GBH but\nI\u2019m sure the courts will understand (on\nsmelling) that technically its a favour.\nAunty McPickle xxx\nDear Aunty McPickle,\nDuring last night\u2019s epic sex mara-thon, I was fucking her from behind\nbut she was getting a bit slack and I\nwas teetering on boredom. I thought\nit\u2019d be a good idea to donkey punch\nher. She\u2019s still unconscious in my\nbed, what the hell do I do?\nJerry Bernett\nDear Jerry,\nI think you should get her some medical\nattention NOW! Blame it on a fall or\nsomething, she\u2019s sure to have forgotten\nthe sex you weren\u2019t enjoying.\nGood luck, I guess.\nAunty McPickle xxx\n\n"

But now matters are complicated, either because\nyou are an astute student who has\ntaken note of it being Green Week, or\nbecause you have got to that stage in\nthe term where you have no money to\nspend on any thing but baked beans\nand beer. Either way this leaves you\nwithout the option of turning on the\nheating. That\u2019s not to say however that\nyou\u2019re not aware of the cold. The clue\nwas when you could see gas evaporating from your steady stream of urine.\nThis can mean only two things a)\nyou live in Scotland or b) it is nearing\nChristmas.\nWe can clearly discount a) ergo it\nB\noys who bake will always\nbe the girls\u2019 favourite on a\nlong coach trip. The Imperial College Symphony\nOrchestra\u2019s annual trip to\nDorchester in Dorset started sweetly\nwith caramel shortbread and oatmeal\nand raisin cookies courtesy of viola\nplayer Owen Davies. His efforts made\nthe three and a half hour coach journey\nmuch more bearable.\nEvery year the orchestra heads off\nfor a free weekend of playing, partying and food. We go to Dorchester to\ngive a concert of our term\u2019s pieces and\nto accompany The Thomas Hardye\nSchool Choir with theirs. Everyone\nis hosted in ones, twos, threes, fours,\nfives and even a six this year by families\nof members of the choir \u2013 or just local\nresidents who enjoy the annual concert\nand want to help out.\nOn Friday night we arrived to find\nthe ladies of Dorchester hard at work\nmaking a delicious meal for us \u2013 many\nthanks go to Kate Cumber for all her\nhard work and fantastic banoffee pie.\nAfter stuffing ourselves to bursting we\nhad our first rehearsal of the weekend\nand then met all of our hosts. Not to\nfall into the student stereotype or anything but most of the orchestra did\nmake it to the pub that night, as did\nsome of the members of the choir. You\nwill be pleased to know however that\nwe weren\u2019t too late out \u2013 our morning\nrehearsal was looming\u2026\nSaturday was filled with rehearsals,\nWetherspoons and tearooms \u2013 in varying amounts. Our lovely hosts provided us with packed lunches \u2013 even\na homemade Victoria Sponge for half\nof the bassoon section. Before our sold\nout evening concert the ladies once\nmore convened to make a delicious\nbuffet dinner for us. As I come from\nDorchester even my mum was helping\nout \u2013 so thank you to her for stirring\nthe soup.\nThe concert opened with Zadok the\nPriest, by Handel, conducted by The\nThomas Hardye School head of Music James Baker. The choir was in fine\nform \u2013 boosted by a few members of\nthe orchestra \u2013 and it went without a\nhitch. Second in the programme was\nVivaldi\u2019s Gloria, with Louise Wayman and Ellie Turner as the soprano\nand alto soloists respectively, both of\nwhom used to sing in the school choir.\nThis was conducted by Peter Oakes,\nthe organiser of the Dorchester trip\nand choir master at the school. A huge\nthank you goes to him as well for making the weekend possible. Once more\nthe choir gave their all and the soloists\nsounded beautiful in the lovely acoustic of St Mary\u2019s Church.\nAfter a brief interval the orchestra\ncame back on to finish the programme\nwith Rachmaninov\u2019s magnificent Symphony No. 2, conducted by Richard\nDickins and led, for the first time, by\nMervyn Chong. The audience was delighted for a third time that evening. I\nfor one thought it was one of our best\never Dorchester concerts. It was great\nto play in such a good acoustic and to\nget such a reception for our efforts.\nIn true Dorchester style the evening\nmoved onto the pub, The Junction,\nwhere sectional shots were a must.\nThanks to our wonderful social secretary Jacob Brady, when we were\nthrown out at closing we all got into\nthe (only) club in Dorchester for half\nprice and partied the night away into\nthe wee hours before (some of us)\nstumbled home. I won\u2019t mention the\nbest dancers of the evening, they know\nwho they are, and the pictures are up\non facebook to prove it\u2026\nA special belated happy birthday\ngoes to Mervyn \u2013 who turned 21 on\nthe Sunday. Dorchester rang into the\nearly morning with \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019,\nprogressively more out of tune.\nOur dedicated hosts managed to\ndrag everyone out of bed and onto the\ncoach for the (approximate) departure\ntime of 10am, and we were all back in\nLondon for a late lunch and a desperately needed nap. Knowing Peter, plans\nwill already be in motion for next year\u2019s\ntrip and I know the whole orchestra\nwill be waiting for it to come round.\nWant to get involved? Email icso@im-perial.ac.uk for more information.\nthe festive time of year must be upon\nus again. Yes it is only 21 days to the\nbig event if you celebrate Christmas,\nthough it\u2019s worth noting that there are\nseveral other festivals that take place\naround this time of year.\nRegardless of which one or many\nthat you choose to celebrate, it probably means it is present time yet again,\nbut before you dash off to the shops\nthis weekend for all the Christmas\nbargains, think again! What would be\nmore awesome than to receive a knitted garment! Well you can make someone\u2019s dream come true!\nNOW is the time to start clicking\naway with those knitting needles or\ntwisting with your crochet hook to create some amazing and unique gifts. It\ndoesn\u2019t matter what level you are- you\ncan start off with the classic rectangular scarf or hat, or go wild knitting\ndinosaurs, lingerie or a multitude of\nother-worldly knitted stuff. Don\u2019t forget that everything in this world could\ndo with a cozy- from your tea cozy, to\nyour iPod cozy, to a walking stick cozy\nfor your Nan.\nYou don\u2019t need me to tell you how\ncool knitting is. But that won\u2019t stop me!\nFrom the dawn of time - approximately\nthe dawn of knitting \u2013 hot women have\nknitted! And it\u2019s a proven fact that men\nwho knit get the hot knitting women.\nKnitsock proudly holds a 50:50 men:\nwomen ratio, a seldom seen occurrence at Imperial. So I ask why not\ncome along?\nDecember will see KnitSock focus on\nthe lead up to Christmas, and we will\nhave our customary jugs of Pimms;\nmasses of scrumptious baked goods;\nCold? Broke? Come and make your own clothes with KnitSock\nsexy women; handsome men and lingerie patterns for altogether warmer\nand kinkier underwear for yourself or\nloved ones during the holiday season.\nWe are also currently planning a trip\nto the land of sheep \u2013 Wales \u2013 not for\nthe sheep. That is something for the\nrugby boys. This will take place in the\nnew year, and we\u2019ll spend a weekend\nknitting in a mountain retreat and a\nvisit to The National Woollen Museum\nDon\u2019t worry if you\u2019re currently salivating at the prospect but have just realised that you can\u2019t knit. Not to worry!\nWe will teach you and give you everything necessary for a beginner as well\nas some patterns to get your creative\njuices flowing!\nCome along and meet the family\n5pm in the Union Bar every Tuesday.\n\u2018Our lovely hosts\nprovided us with\npacked lunches,\neven a homemade\nVictoria Sponge for\nthe bassoon section.\u2019\nEmail: knit.sock@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Due to the\nshortage of material and factory work-ers, clothes rationing started in 1941\nand lasted for 8 years.\nAt the time, everyone in the household was given a booklet of coupons\nto exchange for clothes. People had\nto go to a shop, present the appropi-ate number of coupons and money in\nexchange for any items from shoes to\npyjamas. For men and boys, an overcoat was worth 16 and 11 coupons; for\nwomen and girls, a dress would cost\nthem 11 and 8 coupons.\nTo prevent people from using up all\nthe coupons in one go, the booklet was\ndivided into colour catego-ries. From time to time,\nthe government would\nannounce which colour to be used in the\nperiod.\nInstead of hitting the\nshops for new clothes,\nthe government also issued a book called\n\u2018Make Do and\nMend\u2019 to encourage women to repair broken items.\nOld curtains could\nbe made into a new\ncoat; dated jumpers could be re-knitted into something new.

Women would get a\nfriend to draw lines at the back of their\nlegs to mimic the seams. In the most\nextreme cases, some even painted their\nlegs with gravy \u2013 which on a hot day\ncould attract flies to their bodies.\nTwo years before the clothes rationing ended in 1947, someone burst onto\nthe fashion scene and transformed the\nperception of fashion for good. His\nname was Christian Dior, a political\nscience student who served in the war\nand eventually became a designer. His\nfirst collection had such a great impact in the fashion world \u2013 his clothes\nwere feminine, youthful and sensuous\n- a huge contrast to the modest civilian\nwar time outfits.\nHarpers Bazaar branded his designs\nthe \u2018New Look\u2019. Today, 1950s fashion is\nstill known as the \u2018New Look of Christian Dior\u2019.\nThe New Look accentuated a woman\u2019s curves while maintaining the\nclothes\u2019 functionality. The 2-piece suit\nfeatured a cinched-waist, large shoulders and a full calf-length dress.\nIn an age where turn-ups on trousers were banned to save materials,\na full Dior New Look would use\nup 10 yards and sometimes up to\n80 yards of material. To achieve the\nfullness of the skirt the wearer may\nrequire a petticoat underneath to\ncreate a buffon look.\nThis lavish use of material\nhad made the reincarnation of this New Look impossible across the English\nChannel when the clothing rationing was still in\nplace. Jane Brostein, the\nfounder of\nThe presence of fashion\u2019s past\nBrowns, famously had to save up coupons in exchange for one of the New\nLook dresses. Nonetheless, it was Dior\nwho had started this new era of fash-ion. Fashion was no longer a mere necessity in life \u2013 it became an art form,\nsomething glamourous and admirable.\nThe 1950s were the Golden Age of\nfashion. The dull civilian war-time\noutfits were suddenly a thing of the\npast. Balenciaga, Balmain, Schiarparelli and Dior created the effortless and\nchicness popularised by Grace Kelly\nand Aurdrey Hepburn. Their looks\nconsisted of a plain black blouse with\na ballerina A-lined skirt or a swoop\nline full length dress is still an all time\nclassic in fashion history. Hussein Chalayan\u2019s AW09 collection featured reinterpretation of the swoop line dress\nwith a raised side slit and reinforced\nshoulders. The 1950s is an era in fashion that will never be forgotten.\nSoon the Parisian society of the 50s\nmoved on to something even more\nglamourous for the hedonic post-war\ndays. Evening dresses were in high demand for dinner parties. Haute Couture continued to grow, reaching almost 3000 private clients across Paris.\nOstrich feathers, rare stones, genuine\npearls and a wide variety of appliques\nwere handsewn by in-house ateliers,\nsometimes taking up to 200 man hours\nfor a dress.\nCoco Chanel understood the appeal\nof fashion, which is always about new-ness. She realised the limits of the exclusivity of Haute Couture and her new\napproach to clothes-making would\neventually morph into the ready-to-wear collections we see today.\nWhen Coco Chanel reopened her\nboutique on 31 Rue Cambon in 1954,\nshe was determined to change the\ncinched-waist look. Chanel\u2019s Upper\nEast Side uniform was born. Boxed\nshape jacket with a straight waist\nand a knee length skirt in a\nrich textured boucle.\nThe 50s also\nmarked the birth of fashion shows.\nFashion shows were strictly a thing\nfor the royalties, nobles and the rich.\nThey would be invited to an exclusive\nlocation and be seated around a round\ntable in a ballroom. Men chatted away\nand smoked cigars; women in expensive jewellery and clothes would sit and\nwatch the models coming out from a\nbackdrop. Fashion shows were less of a\ntheatrical show then. Models casually\nwalked along the centre of the room \u2013\nnot on a runway \u2013 to demonstrate the\nclothes. Dior\u2019s first collection was secretly shown to Queen Elizabeth at the\nFrench embassy.\n60 years later, the mood of war is\nback. Some of the wartime classics are\nreinvented by many fashion houses,\nmost notably the double-breasted\nwool coat as seen at DNKY, Michael\nKors, Louis Vuitton and Prada that\nboasts functionality.\nAlber Elbaz of Lavin and John Galliano of Dior both revisited the archive\nand brought back the post-war ladylike\nskirt suit. Christian Dior\u2019s debut classic is retouched to include a mid-body\nleather belt and a dropped neckline.\nSome designers were being more\noptimistic. The runways of Balmain,\nGucci and Marc Jacobs demonstrated\na more frivolous mood. The glitter of\nsequins and the flourescent colours\npossibly reflect the hopes of these designers that by winter, the financial\nwoe will be over and everyone will be\nraising their champagne glasses again.\nWorries will never cease to haunt us.\nAnother tornado is tearing through\nthe money markets in the shape of a\n6-star sail shaped hotel. Lloyd\u2019s TSB is\nin trouble again, everyone in the city\nfrowns and businesses are pondering\ntheir future with the market in another\nwave of distrust. This is why fashion is\na sanctuary to all. Fashion never sulks,\nit is always glamourous and fun. The\nsimplest form of escapism is at hand to\nall of us \u2013 leave the real world behind\nfor a minute or two. Let\u2019s indulge ourselves in another dose of fashion.\n1941\nClothes rationing starts. Coupons are\nexchanged for clothes. Women are encouraged to make do and mend.\n1947\nChristian Dior debuts his New\nLook designs. The Golden Age\nof fashion starts.\n1954\nGrace Kelly in Rear Window.\nTulle was traditionally used as\nan undergarment.\n2009\nJohn Galliano revisits the\nGolden Age and features underwear as outerwear.\n1950\nDesigners such as Cristobal Balenciaga and Pierre Balmain contribute\nto the Golden Age dresses.\n\n"

You\nmight think that 1949 isn\u2019t so far back\nfor the games industry, and maybe if\nyou chose old enough games you\u2019d get\nthere eventually. Space Invaders? 1978.\nPong? 1972. In fact, in 1949, we were a\nfull thirteen years away from the first\ncomputer game being hacked out on\na PDP-1 at MIT over in the US. And\nSpacewar was hardly a global phenomenon at the time.\nHowever, that in itself should be food\nfor thought. Although computers were\na reality in 1949, we were a long way off\ngraphical interfaces. Yet since then we\nhave developed techniques and technology to create scenes of such high-fidelity that a reader of felix\u2019s first issue\nwould have found it hard to distinguish\nthem from photographs. That\u2019s somewhat humbling.\nI suppose the obvious question to\nask is where we\u2019ll be in another sixty\nyears\u2019 time, but it seems a question\nthat\u2019s fruitless to answer. The impact\nof home computing or the internet on\nvideo games had an unpredictable and\nvast effect on gaming as a hobby, and\nby the time you\u2019re drawing your pension you will most likely no longer be\nable to relate Modern Warfare 2 to the\nhobbies your grandchildren enjoy.\nGaming\u2019s youth is currently a drawback of sorts. It would be hard to cite\nany major cultural landmarks for gaming that are more than forty years old,\nand for some people that\u2019s a good excuse to dismiss gaming as a medium\nin its infancy. A lot of people use the\nfilm industry analogy, that we\u2019re only\njust entering the age of the talkie, or\nsimilar nonsense. The truth is that\nwhile reflecting on six decades of felix\nis a good thing, it\u2019s very hard to compare one period of time to another, and\neven harder to compare the passage of\ntime. Things change fast, and gaming\nis transforming at a frighteningly fast\nrate. Ten years ago, I visited the Millennium Dome, where I was told how\na 1Mbit internet connection could\ndownload a movie trailer for Lord of\nthe Rings in just nine minutes. Nine\nminutes! On the sort of connections\nyou can now obtain at Imperial College, downloading the entire trilogy\nof films would take somewhere in the\nregion of half an hour.\nNext week, we look at 2009 in gaming and give you the change to take\nhome some of its highlights in competition form. But whether you look\nback at a year, a decade or six of them,\nthe change you\u2019ll see is huge. If nothing else, it should excite you about the\nnext twelve months.\nGames Editor\nMichaelCook\nModern Warfare Two\nTristan Allwooddoesn\u2019tneedonlinemultiplayer-andneitherdoyou\nS\no, I found someone who had\navoided all the hype surrounding Modern Warfare\n2.

John Malkovich plays serial romancer Prof. David Lurie, who\nteaches romantic poetry at Cape Town\nUniversity. Feeling lonely and unappreciated by his class, Lurie impulsively starts an obsessive relationship with\na reluctant mixed-race student, Melanie. The relationship is swiftly revealed\nalthough Lurie offers no defence to his\ncase. The words \u201cyour days are over\nCasanova\u201d are written on his black-board, although the unfazed professor\nleaves his post seemingly guilt-free. He\nfancies himself to be an owner of a mad\nheart instead of a corrupted mind.\nThe beginning could be considered a plot of a film in itself,\nalthough it is only the starting point\nfor Lurie\u2019s journey. Soon after, Lurie\nleaves to live with his daughter Lucy,\nwho lives alone on a remote farm. Lucy\nis the only woman Lurie can form a\nconnection with, and despite the obvious dangers of living alone, Lucy is immovable and proud of her land.\nWhen three men suddenly attack\nLurie and rape Lucy at her farm,\ntheir lives are uprooted\nand the father-daughter\nrelationship is taken to a\nnew level. Lurie becomes obsessed\nwith conspiring against\nthe\nmysterious Petrus (Eriq Ebouaney)- a\nman who lives and works on the farm.\nLurie is concerned with the lack of\nboundaries that Petrus has around the\nfarm, and the relationship that he has\nwith one of the attackers. After the at-tack, Lucy must rebuild her previously\nuntarnished world, and Lurie must\ngrasp the decisions that she makes\nand adapt to an unfamiliar place. Lucy\nwants to leave her past behind, claiming it is a \u201cprivate matter\u201d, although\nLurie wants justice for what has happened to his invaluable daughter.\nYou can imagine that the fast paced\nstory would fill a book excellently, although there is almost too much to\npack into two hours. Several important\nmoments are crammed into a few brief\nscenes, so the characters\u2019 development\nis blunt. Saying that, it definitely contains enough drama to keep you gripped\nthroughout the film, and South Africa\u2019s\nopen landscapes provide a superb backdrop to illustrate the exposed land. The\nperformances are absorbing, especially\nJohn Malkovich, who produces a gripping portrayal of a flawed man. Despite\nthe failures of Lurie, Malkovich forms a\ncharacter you can empathize with.\nThe film is shot tastefully, and the\ncharacters give the powerful story an excellent backbone, although the portrayal\nofpost-apartheidSouthAfricaissome-what rushed. Disgrace is an interesting tale of a country trying\nto rediscover itself after\nthe hurtful apartheid.\nLurie\u2019s unforgiving approach to\nthe people he encounters is a good\nindication of the\nhopelessness in\nthe country.\nJessica Haines\nmakes her film\ndebut\nplay-U.K. Top ten\nBox Office\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\nTwilight Saga: New Moon\nWeekend Total - \u00a34,303,257\nGrand Total - \u00a320,320,686\nParanormal Activity\nWeekend Total - \u00a33,593,762\nGrand Total - \u00a33,593,762\nA Christmas Carol\nWeekend total - \u00a31,935,283\nGrand total - \u00a311,333,978\n2012\nWeekend Total - \u00a31,834,817\nGrand Total - \u00a316,217,379\nLaw Abiding Citizen\nWeekend Total - \u00a31,488,143\nGrand Total - \u00a31,488,143\nNativity!\nWeekend Total - \u00a3794,314\nGrand Total - \u00a3794,314\nHarry Brown\nWeekend Total - \u00a3333,459\nGrand Total - \u00a33,519,275\nUp!\nWeekend Total - \u00a3327,174\nGrand Total - \u00a333,963,586\nDe Dana Dan\nWeekend Total - \u00a3308,029\nGrand Total - \u00a3308,029\nA Serious Man\nWeekend Total - \u00a3243,964\nGrand Total - \u00a3744,239\nBased on a true story, Amelia is a\nnon-fictitious, extraordinary story of\nan extraordinary woman who tried\nthe impossible. And it stars Hillary\nSwank, yes, the Oscar season is here.\nBut given the film\u2019s quality, chances of\nSwank scoring a nomination is looking\nvery unlikely, unless there are no more\ndecent performances from now until\naround December/January.\nAmelia Earheart was a pilot who accomplished many avian techniques\nand broke many records as a woman\nhowever she mysteriously disappeared over the central Pacific Ocean\nwhilst she was trying to complete her\ncircum-navigational flight of the globe.\nShe was the first person to fly solo between Hawaii and California, however\nto modern viewers her disappearance\nis possibly the only interesting thing\nabout her and most likely why she\u2019s\nactually famous. The film focuses on\nvarious awards and titles that she won;\nthat and the occasional shallow/light\nlook at her love life with the publishing\ntycoon George Putnam (Richard Gere)\nand an aviation administrator Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor). By focusing way\ntoo much on the dull, predictable romance and her extraordinary awards,\nthe film feels more like a detailed\ndocumentary on Earhart\u2019s life, whilst\nnever fully engaging the audience.\nThe film\u2019s incredibly unsubtle Oscar-baiting format is actually more\nirritating than anything else. Grand\ncinematography bombards the screen,\nHillary Swank puts on a funny accent\nto imitate the flying legend and there\u2019s\npompous music to emphasise the great\nemotional challenge that Amelia\nEarheart had to go through. The\nfilm appears to be desperate\nto snatch up some awards\nby deluding the voters with\nits technical beauty and\nachievements, as it was never\ngoing to perform too successfully at the box-office.\nSadly, the film will probably\nend up gaining neither.\nIt\u2019s obvious to see\nwhy Swank was\ncast in this dismal biopic. She\u2019s\nan excellent\nactress and\nalso resembles the\nlate legend\nbut even she\ncan\u2019t salvage this messy script and\ndirection. The narrative is repetitive and confused, and doesn\u2019t know\nwhether it wants to be a doomed romance film or a dull biographical film\nthat tries to squeeze in as many of\nEarhart\u2019s achievements in the shortest\nrunning time as possible. Either way,\nthis project wasn\u2019t going to startle the\nviewers in any way.\nAmelia is a lazy attempt to gain\nsome OsJohnPark car love. Who knows? It may get some\nnominations. But I hope they\u2019re all in\nthe technical department. The scenes\ninvolving old-looking, beautiful planes\nare definitely impressive, the period\ncostume is always an Oscar favourite\nand the score fits the adventurous style\nperfectly. The cast is fantastic, but\nlooking at the film\nas a whole, it\u2019s a\ncomplete waste\nof talent. Swank,\nGere and McGregor deserve\nso much better\nthan this.\nCompetition\nWe have four\nfree tickets for\nMascarades to give\naway!\nMascarades is showing at the Cin\u00e9\nLumi\u00e8re as part of their French Film\nFestival.

However, the year\nculminated in a few important things\nstill relevant today.\nOne of the first computers was dev-loped, the Manchester Mark 1, also\nknown as the Manchester Automatic\nThis computer is historically significant because of its pioneering inclusion of Index registers, an innovation\nwhich made it easier for a program to\nread sequentially through an array of\nwords in memory.\nThirty-four patents resulted from\nthe machine\u2019s development, and many\nof the ideas behind its design were incorporated in subsequent commercial\nproducts such as the IBM 701 and 702\nas well as the Ferranti Mark 1.\nDevelopment ceased at the end\nof 1949, and the machine was later\nscrapped.\nFinally, the first automatic streetlights\nwere installed. The first automatic\nstreetlight was installed in 1949 in\nNew Milford, Ct. This was an automatic streetlight system in which the\nstreetlights turned themselves on at\nAntihistamines were also discovered\nin 1949. Also referred to as histamine\nantagonists, these inhibit the action\n\u2018Radiocarbon dating\u2019 \u2013 or just \u2018carbon\ndating\u2019 \u2013 is one of the best known\nmethods of absolute dating used today\nby archaeologists and scientists alike.\nThe most outstanding aspect of this\nmethod is that it allows deposits to be\ndated independent of any other substances or information.\nRadiocarbon dating was developed\nby Willard Libby and his colleagues,\nwho first measured the radioactive\nhalf-life of carbon-14 at the University of Chicago in 1949. The method\nof carbon dating is centralised around\none of the three isotopes of carbon\nfound naturally on Earth. Two of these\nisotopes, carbon-12 and -13, are stable and account for the majority of\nnatural carbon. The trace remaining is\ncarbon-14 which is radioactive with a\nhalf-life, known as the Libby half-life,\nof 5568\u00b130 years.\nCarbon-14 is formed in the upper atmosphere, as a result of cosmic\nray neutrons interacting with nitro-gen-14 atoms to produce carbon-14\natoms and protons. The carbon-14 is\noxidised and enters the organic environment as a carbon dioxide isotope.\nApproximately one carbon-14 atom\nexists in nature for every 1000 billion\ncarbon-12 atoms. Hence the proportion of carbon-14 atoms found in any\norganic substance, once it is no longer\nliving, can be used to calculate the time\nbetween the \u2018death\u2019 of the sample and\nthe present day.\nWhen carbon-14 decays, it emits a\nbeta particle to become nitrogen-14\nonce again. After ten half-lives, the exponential nature of radioactive decay\nmeans there is insufficient carbon-14\nwithin a sample to allow for it to be\n\u2018dated\u2019 using this method. However,\ncarbon dating is suitable for placing an\nage on any sample which has \u2018died\u2019 in\nthe past 50 to 60,000 years.\nAs well as the necessity for the sample being investigated to fall within this\ntime bracket, any results obtained must\nbe calibrated by comparison with samples dated using other methods. This\ncalibration is needed in order to account for the variation in atmospheric\ncarbon-14 levels over time. Changes\nin cosmic ray intensity and the Earth\u2019s\nclimate both have an effect on isotope\nlevels and must be accounted for in\norder to date a sample accurately. An\nexample of this is atomic bomb tests in\nthe 1950s and 60s causing carbon-14\nlevels to double for a short period of\ntime.\nAlthough the Libby half-life was later\nfound not to be an altogether accurate value for the half-life of carbon-14\n(nowadays, the \u2018Cambridge half-life\u2019 is\noften quoted - 5730\u00b140 years) the calibration of the results cancels out any in-Brigette Atkins\nBrigette Atkins Science Editor\n60,000\nyears old\nDue to the half-life of carbon-14,\ncarbon dating is limited to samples\nwhich have ceased to be living in the\npast 50 to 60,000 years.\nup to\naccuracies and allows carbon dating to\nremain as one of the most widely used\nand globally consistent methods of dating samples. The development of radiocarbon dating also gained Libby the\n1960 Nobel Prize for Chemistry \u201cfor his\nmethod to use carbon-14 for age determination in archaeology, geology, geo-physics, and other branches of science\u201d.\nNathan Ley\nNathan Ley Science Editor\n1:1,000billion\nThe ratio of carbon-14 atoms to\ncarbon-12 atoms found natually\noccuring\nvide a computing resource within the\nuniversity and to allow researchers to\ngain experience in using computers.\nSubsequently it became a prototype on\nwhich the design of Ferranti\u2019s commercial version was based.\nThe Manchester Automatic Digital Machine (MADM)\nDigital Machine (MADM). The machine was reported upon positively in\nthe british press, being described as an\nelectronic brain.\nThis description provoked a reaction\nfrom the head of Manchester University\u2019s Department of Neurosurgery,\nwhich began a long-running debate\nas to whether an electronic computer\ncould ever be truly creative.\nThe Mark 1 was developed to proof histamine. Histamines are involved\nin local immune responses, as well as\nin acting as a neurotransmitter. Histamine triggers the inflammatory\nresponse.\nUpon invasion of foreign pathogens,\nhistamine is produced by basophils\nfound in nearby connective tissue. The\nfunction of histamine is to increase the\npermeability of the capillaries to white\nblood cells and other proteins in order to allow these to engage with the\npathogens in the affected tissues. Such\nis the nature of an innate response,\nhistamines are located in every animal\ncell of the body.\nSince antihistamines act to do\nthe opposite function of histamines\n(which do a bloody good job) you may\nbe wondering why their discovery was\nso important?

I returned to Lakeside to\nhave one final night relaxing in\na hammock before moving on.\nHowever as often happens, I met a large\ngroup of people that were heading out\ninto the city for a night out. We drank\nsome cheap local whisky to get the party\nstarted, which was clearly a bad idea to\nbegin with. Buying any bottle of spirit\nthat costs $1 a litre is dicing with death,\nand the delightful Mekong whisky was\nno exception. Feeling very ill we took a\ntuk-tuk to a local club recommended by\none of the group, quite worried by the fact\nwe had no idea where we were and would\nbe an easy target for any robbers.\nWe were in fact the centre of attention\nin the club. As Caucasians we were all\na good foot taller than all the Cambodian partygoers so at any point we could\nsee everyone in the group regardless of\nwhere they were. Soon we were dancing\nto the crazy electro music in a circle and\none by one the locals joined, making the\ncircle almost the size of the whole dance\nfloor. After a while it dawned on us that\nthere was something very odd about the\nplace. It turned out the club was in fact a\ngay bar, which was probably why we were\nbeing paid so much interest.\nOnce it closed we decided to get transport back but being cheapskates we managed to fit thirteen of us in a 2-seat tuk-tuk and negotiated the fee down to $3 in\ntotal. With several people hanging out of\nthe side and two people \u2018surfing\u2019 on the\nroof we were a sight to behold and passing police cars simply laughed at us. Every\ntime we tried to turn a corner, or even\nslightly swerve, the whole vehicle would\nlean over and the tires ground against\nthe wheel-arch so we would pull people\nin or lean them out at various distances\nto even it out. It couldn\u2019t get above 5mph\nand most of the time several people\nwould get off and walk to allow it to get\nback up to speed, but we crawled into the\nguesthouse about 40 minutes later and\nfelt so guilty that we each gave the driver\na dollar tip. He was a very happy man that\nnight.\nAfter all that excitement I now bring\nyou to the temples of Angkor. The town\nof Siem Reap is the jumping off point for\nanyone going to Angkor so it is a magnet for every tourist operator in SE Asia.\nThe entire town is made up of hundreds\nof giant four-star hotels and even more\nbudget guesthouses for the cheapest of\ntravellers. It is the one part of Cambodia\nthat appears to have had any sort of serious investment, but mostly only to lure in\nthe foreign money rather than to actually\nbenefit the locals.\nOver the centuries, many cities and\ntemples were built around the Angkor\narea, all of whom are seemingly completely separate from each other; I explored at least twenty temples and not\none of them even remotely resembled\nthe last. I had thought that two days of\ntemples would have bored me shitless but\nthey were simply amazing.\nThe first day I decided to hire a rusty\none-speed bike as the cheapest way of exploring the area, but very quickly realised\nthat I was going to spend the day covered\nin sweat and dirt. The roads were often\njust bright orange soil and the mudguards\nwere no match for the dust thrown up by\nmy tires. However, after about half an\nhour of cycling I had reached the first\npoint on the map.\nThe most famous temple is in fact the\nbiggest, Angkor Wat, and it certainly is\nimpressive due to its size, but it was not\nnecessarily the best. It is surrounded by a\nmoat of simply jaw-dropping size, which\nhad been built by hand, supposedly by\nslave laborers, and which definitely puts\nthe Tower of London moat to shame.\nMany buildings had the steepest stairs\nthat I have ever seen, and climbing them\nwithout a harness seemed a good idea\nat the time, but quickly my vertigo took\nover. One temple had been allowed to\nbecome overgrown for the last thousand\nyears and has remained untouched since,\napart from a few support beams keeping\nthe structure stable. The roots of 100ft\nhigh trees seem to flow over the roofs and\nwalls and become a part of the structure,\nand I could tell why this particular location was chosen for the filming of Tomb\nRaider.\nMy favorite temple was by far Preah\nKhan. The complex was almost deserted\nduring my visit and it was incredibly easy\nto get completely lost wandering around\nthe endless maze and seeing where nature had started taking over. I was surprised that even in this heavily touristic\nenvironment the temples seemed empty.\nAt some points I would climb into an\nold ruined building and read a book for\na while completely undisturbed in total\nsilence. Every so often, I would stumble\nupon small groups of blind and/or mutilated children who would play a short\npiece of music automatically as you\npassed.\nMy final experience of the country was\ngoing through the incredible busy border control into Thailand. The no-man\u2019s\nland between the passport controls were\nin fact a tax-haven for giant casinos and\npeople seemed to throng freely between\nthe sides of the border.\nIt is said that Cambodia will definitely\nmakeyoufeelalotmorecharitablehaving\nseen the conditions that exist there, and I\nthink that is very true. Overall I am very\nglad I made the effort to go to Cambodia;\nI met amazing people and saw a new side\nto life that I will always remember.\nThe main walkway into the temple\nThe lakes and courtyards resemble the oceans and continents of the real world.\nTrees in Preah Khan have taken over the ruins in the last thousand years.\nThe steep steps leading up to the central building of Angkor itself.\nAngkor What?

Levy)\nMORPHY CUP.\nBefore the day, although opinions were divided as to who would win the Morphy Cup, all were agreed that it would be a coxswain\u00d5 s\nrace. It was! For the first time in living memory a clash occurred, necessitating a restart, and this happened not once, but three times.\nIn view of this, perhaps a few words on steering the Morphy would be helpful. The Laws of Boat Racing state that the proper\ncourse for a boat to be steered is that which will take it to the finish in the shortest time. This means that the coxswains must try\nto keep their boats in the fastest flowing part of the stream. Thus, in the Morphy, the first battle for position,comes at Harrods bend,\nwhere a wi de turn means the outside crew losing the stream, and the second at Fulham football ground where, if a wide turn is made,\nthe inside crew can gain \u00bd a length in a few strokes.\nMindful of the way in which, by superb coxing, Guilds had won the Morphy last year, the coaches of the R.S.M and R.C.S crews spent\nmuch time in telling their coxes that they must on no account be pushed out of their courses. As it turned out, the coxes, for once, had\nlistened only too well, and mistaking injunctions against being pushed for orders to force their way through, they made a fiasco of\nwhat would probably have been the finest Morphy ever.\nSo much for explanations. What of the race itself?\nAs the crews drifted under Hammersmith Bridge the sun came out and made conditions for the race us perfect as could be wished.\nR.C.S. and R.S.M. made excellent starts but Guilds appeared slightly rushed, but even so rowed stroke for stroke with R.C.S. and completed\nthe first 10 in just under the quarter \u00d0 a phenomenal rating for heavy clinkers. R.C.S. had their nose in front from the second stroke\nand proceeded to take it away well, blades being really solid in the water. As the crews approached Harrods, R.S.M. began to decrease the\ninches lead of the R.C.S., and at the lower end of Harrods wharf were about 2 feet up on the R.C.S., with Guilds a further 2 feet behind.\nMines, on the inside of the bend, were a ]ittle wide and a slight clash occurred between R.C.S. and Guilds, which they were able to clear\nwithout difficulty. All three crews were rowing well, particularly the Mines, who with real heavyweights in the middle of the boat were\nmaking best use of them by rowing at a slightly slower rate of striking. As the crews approached the Crabtree, Mines were leading, by\n\u00bc length from the R.C.S., who were slightly up on Guilds. All three crews were very close together, and, in trying to avoid a clash with\nMines, R.C.S. clashed with Guilds. The umpire stopped the race and sent the crews back to the start.\nYour correspondent has been informed by members of all three crews that it was their crew which was going up at the time. With\nover a mile to go it was still anyone\u00d5 s race.\nThe second start was Guilds all the way. They made a perfect start and were nearly \u00bd a length up at Harrods when Mines, taking\nthe bend, too wide, clashed with R.C.S., and the race was stopped for the second, time. The only consoling thought forthe crews was how\nthe vast body of police at Putney must have been enjoying themselves.\nAt the third start Mines just got their nose i n front, but they could do no more, and a magnificent race ensued with less than\n4 feet separating first and last crews, and no more than 2 feet between blade tips. At the Crabtree Mines were just leading Guilds, who\nwere only just leading R.C.S. At the mile post Guilds were up by a canvas with Mines nearly a canvas up on R.C.S. Approaching Fulham\nfootball ground, Guilds were \u00bc length up on Mines, who were a canvas up on R.C.S. The Guilds cox, on the inside of this bend, began to\ntake it on a long turn, and the R.C.S. followed him round. The Mines cox appeared to think that the other two were making a short turn,\ncame round too far and too fast, and h i t R.C.S.\nThe umpire stopped the race and restarted them in the relative positions before the clash. The row-in past the boat houses was\nno reflection of the racing that had gone before, and it was decided that the result to be recorded should be that at the time of the\nlast clash. Guilds, \u00bc length, Mines, a canvas, R.C.S.\nThe time taken was 1 hour 20 minutes, a record for this 7\u00bd minute course.\nCrews.\nC & G.

The Guilds crew, an excellent one, made no mistake and showed that the way it had harried its first\nboat in training had made it unbeatable. They went ahead to win easily, leaving a most exciting race for second place between R.C.S and\nMines, in which both crews lead several times by a foot or two only to be pulled back by sheer fighting spirit.

Happy 60th Birthday dear felix!\nHolly Cumbers thought it would be a grand idea if everyone made a cake to celebrate this occasion!\nY\nou should all know me by\nnow, I adore cakes! Therefore as this is felix\u2019s 60th\nBirthday I decided to give\nyou a recipe for an ultra-special birthday cake, letting you join in\nwith the celebrations. If you are feeling\nespecially kind you could share it with us\nall at felix- we would all apreciate a piece\nof cake! However I think I may be pushing my luck ever so slightly!\nHowever this is no ordinary cake\nrecipe- to tie in with the 1950s theme I\nthought it would be good to give you a\nrecipe from the 1950s- so you can celebrate like it is 1949! Heck, why don\u2019t\nyou go all out and have a 1949 party,\ngrab your best 1950s frock or suit,\nget your friends to do the same, put\non some music from that era which I\nthink is sensational, let your hair down\nand party! Don\u2019t forget the wine either!\nUnfortunately I don\u2019t think you will be\nable to get hold of any vintage alcohol.\nSo enjoy transporting yourself back to\nthe 1950s this week.\nRationing, bad cooking and some spam\nF\nelix is 60! He will now be able\nto collect his pension! So to\ncelebrate this special occasion we thought it was important to tell you a bit more\nabout the diet of Imperial\u2019s students in\n1949 and its following years.\nTransport yourself back to the beginning of the nineteen-fifties. An interesting proposition, one might think.\nWell, I guess it depends on your definition of \u2018interesting\u2019. For a foodie such\nas myself, the word \u2018interesting\u2019 could\nvery well be replaced with \u2018nightmare\u2019.\nSo why the use of such a harsh word?\nLet me explain. The after-effects\nof World War II were still prominent\nthroughout nearly every aspect of British life in the early 1950s. This was\nparticularly noticeable at home on the\ndinner table, with everyday necessities\nsuch as sugar, butter, cheese, cooking\nfat, margarine, bacon, meat and tea\nstill being rationed. In fact, it took until\n1954 for meat and bacon to come off\nthe ration. To make matters worse, you\ncould only buy food from butchers and\ngrocers with whom you were registered\nwith, and even then what you took\nhome depended on what was keeping\ntheir shelves warm. And it gets better.\nA decade of rationing left housewives\nwith inadequate cooking skills, resulting in run-of-the-mill, bland cooking\nand rather un-amused palettes.\nI guess all was not all doom and\ngloom in the Fifties. As rationing end-ed, a greater variety of food returned\nto the shelves. Bananas and oranges,\nso sorely missed during the war, eventually made a welcomed return to the\nshopping list. And then food shopping\nas we know it today was conceived,\nwith a self-service style of shop emanating from the States arriving on British shores. They even had the long-lost\nuncle of the modern shopping trol-ley, \u2018the pram\u2019: a wheeled frame well\ncapable of holding two baskets. Another plus for this decade was that the\nre-emerging trend of eating seasonal\nproduce was the norm during this less\nagriculturally advanced period. And before Jamie Oliver came along, modern\nschool meals were not a patch on their\nFifties\u2019 counterparts. Real, unprocessed\nfood such as meat and two veg, macaroni and cheese and fish on Fridays\nensured that children got the fill they\ndeserved. And a British classic, Coronation chicken, was one of the most widespread favourites conjured up during\nthe celebration of Elizabeth II\u2019s coro-nation. Cold chicken, with an aromatic\ncurry-spiced mayo and sliced and diced\napricots really got the nation\u2019s tastebuds\ntalking, and I guess, at least every now\nand again, it still does today.\nThat\u2019s the end of the 1950s food education lesson for today folks. I would\nreally recommend making the spam\nfritters, as they are so simple to make\nand extremely tasty (I say that slightly\nsarcastically!)\nSo to conclude, whilst Spam and\nrationing will probably live a bit too\nlong in the memory of the post-war\ngeneration, those hard times undoubtedly had moments of gastronomic\npleasure, even if they were few and\nfar between. At least we do not have\nto eat Spam anymore that is definitely\nsomething else to celebrate! We are the\nlucky ones- some of us may have never\ntasted spam. But make sure you try it\nat least once.\nSpam Fritters\nSpam sums up the food of the early 1950s: a ghastly\nsource of protein born out of sheer necessity. Made out\nof pork entrails and random bits of shoulder meat, it still\nbaffles me why people still eat it today. It really does. But\nhere\u2019s a Spam Fritter recipe just for the sheer hell of it.\nHere\u2019s how to make them:\n1. Slice your spam into 8 slices whilst heating 2-3 tablespoons of oil in a pan. Mix batter ingredients together.\n2. Smother the \u2018spamlets\u2019 in batter before dropping\nthem carefully into the hot oil.\n3. Fry the fritters for 2-3minutes on each side until gold-en-ish colour.\n4. Enjoy this timeless recipe with chips.\n(I am sure you will enjoy this, because we all love Spam!)\nA slab of Spam\n(12 ounces to be precise)\nOil for Frying\nBatter mix:\n1 cup of flour\n1 large egg\n\u00bd pint of milk\nServes 4\n60th Anniversary cake\n1. Measure sifted flour, baking powder, and salt; sift together three\ntimes.\n2. In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Add half the sugar\ngradually, and continue beating only until meringue will hold up in soft\npeaks.\n3. Cream butter or margarine. Gradually add remaining sugar, and\ncream together until light and fluffy. Add sifted ingredients and add milk\na small amount at a time, beating after each addition until smooth. Mix\nin flavourings. Add egg whites and beat thoroughly into batter. Spread\nbatter onto a 15 x 10 x 1 inch pan which has been lined on the bottom with\ngreaseproof paper.\n4. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 35 minutes. Cool cake\nin pan for 10 minutes, then remove from pan and transfer to a wire rack to\nfinish cooling. This cake may also be baked in two 9 inch round pans for 30\nto 35 minutes, or in three 8 inch round pans for 25 to 30 minutes.\nServes our entire party!\n260 grammes cake flour,\n4 teaspoons baking powder\n\u00be teaspoon salt\n4 egg whites\n180 grammes white sugar\n90 grammes butter\n90 ml milk\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 teaspoon almond extract\nThis cake is truly heavenly. We suggest you make it for us...\nSpam, Spam, Spam. Everyone\nshould like SPAM!\n\n"

    "content": "27\nfelix FRIDAY 04 DECEMBER 2009\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk TRAVEL\nA\nfew weeks ago when I wrote\nthis, the Christmas holidays didn\u2019t feel as close, yet\nI still feel the same- a trashy\nholiday would be nice. To\ngo against the general eco, backpacker\nview, sometimes it is good to just go\nsomewhere simply to enjoy yourself, and\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing. Ideally far\naway, expensive, and with time spent in\nhotels, a non-culture holiday is brain and\nbody candy.\nExpensive things are generally good,\nbut seem especially appealing as I just\nmanaged to spend \u00a330 on fish fingers and\nTaboo vodka at Essentials-money seems\nto be scampering away like a rabbit on\nspeed at the moment and I don\u2019t want to\nspend most of it on Admiral frozen food.\nFar away would be nice too, as plane\ntravel has made everything so quick\nnowadays that I often feel like I could be\nstill in England with the tiny time it took\nto get somewhere. Crossing time zones\nand spending more than a few hours on\na plane seems to make the escapism of a\nholiday more real, at least to me.\nHotels are also good, mostly because\nof the decadent fantasy atmosphere\nthey create, as long as you know to go\nexploring and not stay encased in them\nthroughout the duration of your stay. A\nbit of time drunk is always welcome too-everyone wants to have fun, especially at\nthis time of year.\nThis got me thinking about Vegas.\nDrinking age there is 21 so I would have\ntrouble in the drunk department, but\nwhen I went there 2 years ago with my\nuncle and brother it was the best in tacky\nconsumerism and pure entertainment, if\nthat is what you are looking for.\nWhen I went, (with family) we stayed\nin the Golden Nugget. This is one of the\nmost famous and old hotels in Vegas\n(apparently you can visit it Grand Theft\nAuto: San Andreas). It has the world\u2019s\nlargest gold nugget on display called \u201cthe\nHand of Faith\u201d, and a lobby extends for\nages, eventually merging into casinos, 2\nrestaurants and a shopping street. Rooms\nat the Nugget, and presumably elsewhere\nin Vegas, have single beds the size of English doubles, extensive mini bars, good\nviews and mirrored ceilings (comical\nconsidering the company I was with).\nDefying global warming, carnival\nlights are everywhere, and at every cor-ner, men flick call girl cards at you (it is\nillegal to actively publicize), advertising\n\u201chot girls delivered to your room quicker\nthan a pizza\u201d. I guess if you think about it,\npizzas have to be cooked, but the slogan\nstill sounds impressive. Dancing girls are\nalso famous from the time Vegas was\nborn- the more kosher side to female en-tertainment. Gambling is a main attraction as well; $50, 000 chips are regularly\nused at some poker tables, and a world\naway from the topless guys playing the\nsame game knee deep in the Nugget pool.\nThis juxtaposition of wealth was in a way\nkind of liberating, as it created an air that\nanyone could live the elusive \u201cAmerican\nDream\u201d and start playing those high value chips.\nSin also comes in liquid variety- people happily walk down the street with a\ncollectible cocktail \u2018bong\u2019 from one of\nthe casinos, and seemingly every second\nstop on the streets is a bar. To complete\nthe carnival theme, (not advised after\ntoo many frozen margaritas) there are\nrollercoasters in most of the casinos- my\nfavourites are the MGM Grand coaster\nand the few up on the skyscraper; the\nview from the top of the building is really\nbeautiful at night.\nVegas is in a desert, satisfying all heat\nseekers with 110 Fahrenheit dry heat.\nActually, one out of the few times it has\nsnowed in Vegas was felix\u2019s anniversary\nyear, where 12inches of snow fell on the\ncity on January. However the (normal)\nheat means cabs have to be taken everywhere at midday unless you want to\ndie-a shame as some of old Vegas\u2019 streets\nare really lovely as you move away from\nthe corporate casinos; old Vegas is really\nbrilliant.\nSo even though I blatantly can\u2019t go, it\nstill is nice to know that somewhere out\nthere people are having mindless fun in a\ndust bowl in Arizona; Sin City is what it\nsays on the packet in almost every sense,\nbut it sure is fun.\nOld Vegas, circa 1949: such a contrast to modern day Vegas with its elements of old-time Western towns.\nSinful holidays arcoss the pond\nOlivia Davies wants to go to the desert lake-bowl city in Arizona - Las Vegas\n2009\nJul,\n1949\n\u0019!\u001c!\nMay,\n1953\nMay,\n1973\nJan,\n1976\nLonely Planet, the current largest travel guide\nbook and digital media\npublisher in the world,\nis founded by Tony\nand Maureen Wheeler\nin their Sydney home\nNew Zealander\nEdmund Hillary and\nNepalese Tenzing\nNorgay reach the\nsummit of Mt Everest\nat 11.30am local time\nhe world\u2019s \ufb01rst commercial\njet airliner, the de Havilland\nCommet, takes its \ufb01rst \ufb02ight\nJun,\n1985\nLaunch of the\nCondorde\nFirst signing of the Schengen Agreement - removal\nof systematic border controls between participating European countries\nFeb,\n1978\nLaunch of the\n\ufb01rst experimental\nBlock-1 GPS satellite\nJan,\n1972\nInterRail \ufb01rst introduced;\ndedicated to under 21s, the\nrail pass allows unlimited\ntrain travel for one month\nEurostar services\nbegins between\nWaterloo International station, Gare\ndu Nord and\nBrussels-South railway station\nNov,\n1994\nAug,\n1984\nhe world\u2019s \ufb01rst commercial\nMagLev transport system,\nAirRail Link in Birmingham,\nopens; development of \ufb01rst\nfull-size working model\ncredited to Imperial College\nprofessor Eric Laithwaite\nSept,\n2004\nSir Richard Branson\nlaunches Virgin Galactic, with promises\nto provide sub-orbital\nspace\ufb02ights to paying\npublic\nJul,\n1969\nNeil Armstrong\nperforms \ufb01rst\nmoon walk\nSept,\n2001\n9/11 terrorist attacks;\ndecline of plane travel\ndue to tighter airport\nsecurity and fear of\nterrorism\nNov,\n1989\nFall of Berlin Wall symbolises\nthe end of Cold War - regulations \ufb02exed for travelling in\nEastern Europe\nIt\u2019s not that fabulous.

If\nyou feel up to it, join us in today\u2019s issue\nas we take a trip down memory lane.\nIn your unsuspecting innocence,\nbeloveds, you may have thought our\nvicious and scathing periodical was a\nrecent creation. The hateful campness\nthat litters its pages like its pages litter\nthe campus could only, you suspected,\nhave been born of a cynical, post-Vi-etnam, post-Thatcherite postal strike-ridden world. Well, far be it for me to\ndestroy that illusion, but allow me to\ndestroy that illusion. This cat, you see,\nis no ordinary cat. It has breeding. It\nhas a history, a lineage and a degree of\npedigree unmatched by your Clapham\ncommon or garden-variety moggie.\nFor today\u2019s issue, in case the brilliance of my invective has blinded you\nto any of the large number of hints\nstrewn throughout the remainder of\nthis paper, marks our 60th anniver-sary. And it is in an attempt to honour\nthe numerous incarnations of our beloved mascot that we stroll down the\nlong and winding road that leads to\nthe land of nostalgia.\nVarious section editors will be attempting to recreate the atmosphere\nof 1949 Britain, with potentially amusing consequences for our games and\ntechnology writers. And my life has\nbeen made a great deal easier by the\nworld\u2019s decision to revive the fun,\nquirky atmosphere which pervaded\ninternational politics in the years following the Second World War.\nI am talking, of course, about the\nwise, level-headed and insightful decision made by the Swiss people to\nprevent the building of minarets in\ntheir land-locked European land of\nfermented milk and money. I use the\nthird-person plural there for understandable yet unforgivable reasons.\nFor although I myself chose to abstain\nin the referendum, my Swiss citizenship forces me to be associated with its\nrepercussions. And its repercussions\nin the political arena may well be sig-nificant, as national leaders and individual legal experts alike are queuing\nup to hurl rotten tomatoes at the Swiss\nas they languish in the depreciating\nstocks of international opprobrium.\nThe world\u2019s opinion of my country is\nvitally important to me, of course, but\nmy own opinion matters even more.\nAnd what I find particularly worrying\nis what the vote says about my chosen\nhomeland.\nThe danger posed by fundamentalist Islam is real, and it is understandable why the Cantonal malcontents of\nThurgau, Glarus and Appenzell Innerrhoden would be opposed to minarets\nblocking their scenic views of lakes\nand mountain ranges. But attempting\nto solve any form of cultural problem\nby banning their construction is akin\nto combating cancer by declaring tumours illegal. It is symbolic, superficial and, most importantly, silly.\nNothing is achieved by forbidding\nmosques to construct minarets, other than a preservation of the pristine\npatina of parochial propriety which\nmatters most to those who think least.\nTreating the tiny Muslim population\nof Switzerland as though their customs and religion are not welcome will\ndo very little to improve the problem\nof cultural integration.\nAll in all, this decision must go down\nin Swiss history as the most misguided\npolitical move since Hermann Gessler\nstuck his hat on a pole in the Altdorf\ntown square and asked Mr. William\nTell why he wasn\u2019t saluting it like all the\nother good little people. That particular incident gave rise to an ingenious\nnew method for coring apples, a Rossini overture, and Swiss independence\nin one fell swoop. It strikes me that the\nmore recent Helvetic developments\nmay not prove quite so productive.\nThis is the unfortunate problem\nposed by direct democracy. Allowing\nthe people to decide for themselves\ncan be a dangerous business, as all too\noften that is precisely what they will\ndo. Taking decisions by national referenda automatically allows the 50%\nof the population who are even more\nbigoted, less well-informed and lazier\nthan the average voter to have what\npasses for a majority in any federal\ndecision.\nWhile many of my compatriots are\npeople as decent and charming as any\nyou could hope to find between the\nPyrenees and the Urals, the country\nis as choc-a-block full of cuckoos as\na Swiss cheese is of holes. I wouldn\u2019t\ntrust half the people who live on my\nstreet to look after my nephew for an\nafternoon, so why would I want them\nto look after his future? Fortunately\nthey have very little chance of doing\neither, given as my nephew lives on a\ndifferent continent.\nIt may be old-fashioned and elitist\nto claim that ordinary people need\nhelp governing themselves, but I expect those individuals who make the\nimportant decisions to be accountable\nto their citizenry \u2013 not emasculated\nby them. A Utopian system of direct\ndemocracy works well in small, homogeneous communities, but minorities\nwill be crushed the moment they dare\nto make themselves known.\nSpeaking with my emotional baggage as a Jew, as well as with my\nmental baggage as a thinking human\nbeing, I find the results of last week\u2019s\nvote unspeakably repellent and utterly\nshameful. And I will shout it as loudly\nas I can from the top of the nearest\nminaret.\nGilead Amit stands up for the minareties\n\u201cToday, the Swiss\nare languishing in\nthe depreciating\nstocks of\ninternational\nopprobrium\u201d\nS\nhock, dismay and furious\nanger filled me as I read last\nweek\u2019s cover story. Us? Dragging down the Golden Triangle? After the nerd-rage\nsubsided, I thought about it and have\nconcluded that we are actually clearly\nmore intelligent than Oxbridge stu-dents. Trust me, I have logic to prove\nit. You like logic, that\u2019s why you\u2019re here.\nThink about it this way, why do we go\nto university? Genuine interest in your\nsubject? I think not. So you can get a\ngood career? That\u2019s much more likely.\nHow does one go about rating one\u2019s\ncareer? Job satisfaction? Ha. Monies?\nHell yeah.\nNow, some facts from the Times\nGood University Guide 2010. The average starting salary of an Imperial graduate is \u00a326,299, compared to \u00a324,460 for\nOxford and \u00a322,964 for Cambridge\n(and if anyone says it\u2019s because we\u2019re in\nLondon, they can\u2026 err\u2026 shhh). I\u2019m going to extrapolate (because I can) and\nsay that starting salary is proportional\nto amount earned over a lifetime. I\u2019m\nalso going to say that this is the single\ncriterion on which one should judge the\nworthiness of a career.\nNow as we\u2019re all scientists let\u2019s consider efficiency. To get the best career\n(max money) most efficiently, you want\nto put in the least work and get the most\nmoney out. Some relation like LifetimeEarnings/HoursWorkedPerWeek-AtUni. I like to call this the Falk ratio.\nI always wanted a formula or a constant or something named after me but\nI suppose I\u2019ll have to settle for a ratio.\nRather than judging a university on its\n\u201cresearch\u201d or \u201cstudent satisfaction\u201d we\nshould judge them on their Falk ratio,\nit pretty much gives you all you need to\nknow.\nAs was proclaimed boldly last week,\nCambridge and Oxford students do an\naverage of 40% and 30% more hours of\nwork respectively per week than us.\nWhat does this mean for their Falk ra-tios? Oh my, we come out on top. Fancy\nthat. If that doesn\u2019t show that we\u2019re\nthe most intelligent I don\u2019t know what\ndoes. We weren\u2019t foolish enough to fall\nfor the stories. We saw past the elegant\nhalls, steeped in history and the universal admiration given to Oxbridge\nstudents. We went past all that and saw\nthe truth, that to be most efficient (and\ntherefore have the best life) Imperial\nwas without doubt the only place to\nbe (except LSE but they don\u2019t do our\ncourses).\nOh wait, no we didn\u2019t: \u201c61% of current Imperial students applied to Oxford or Cambridge as their original first\nchoice\u201d. That tells me one thing, 39% of\ncurrent Imperial students lie to make\nthemselves feel better. Well no longer\ndo we need to be bitter about our re-jection. We can rest on our Falk ratio\nsmugly and look down on our poorer\nOxbridge counterparts in years to\ncome. They\u2019ll be there enjoying their\n\u201csatisfying jobs\u201d and their \u201cfamilies\u201d.\nMaybe we\u2019ll see them as we speed past\nin our sports cars. Well not likely, we\u2019ll\nprobably be driving them at 6am, it\u2019s\nno fun driving a fast car in traffic and\nwe need to be at work for 7. Come to\nthink of it, because we work at investment banks, we\u2019ll only be leaving work\nat around 6am. It\u2019s fine though we can\nlaugh at them on one of ours days off.\nSo that\u2019ll be Christmas Day. Hmmm.\nAdam Falk with a very bitter article\n\u201cTo get the best\ncareer (max\nmoney)... you\nwant to put in\nthe least work\nand get the most\nmoney out\u201d\n\n"

It does\nfeel wonderful to be back though, I\nthink I was in danger of my fellow editors disowning me, but divulging the\npolitics of the felix office is not quite\nwhat this section is for so thats more\nthan enough of that.\nRight, well I think thats as self-indul-gent an opening as I dare to give, forgive me, I am attempting to stumble my\nway back into the swing of things. So,\non to much more important matters...\nFirst of all, I would like to wish felix\na very happy birthday. Our esteemed\nnewspaper has reached sexagenarian\nstatus, and this issue is quite rightly\nreveling in the occasion. At the ripe\nold age of 60, felix can look back on its\nlife thus far with pride and anticipate\nthe future with excitement (albeit with\na hint of humorous cynicism, a hallmark of the paper). I salute you felix,\nyou truly are a prince amongst student\nnewspapers.\nWhat on earth does this all have to\ndo with politics, I hear you cry. Well,\nnot very much, but brace yourself for\nI am about to take felix on a political\nrollercoaster through the last 60 years\nstarting with the year of its birth.\n1949, what a year! Aside from the inception of our beloved newspaper, this\nwas the year the Democratic Republic\nof Germany was founded, the year Stalin decided to lift the Berlin Blockade\nand the year Goerge Orwell\u2019s \u2018Nineteen\nEighty Four\u2019 was published. I could detail a plethora of significant events...\nFast forward through the 1950s,\nthe Cold War is simmering despite\nthe death of Stalin in 1953. However,\nthe increasing paranoia with regards\nto Communism leads to the rise of a\ncertain Senator McCarthy and his aptitude for innuendo and intense inter-rogation. You could offer a beggar a\nfew cents and be incarcerated for \u2018socialist tendencies\u2019. 1959 saw the Cuban\nRevolution, bringing communism to\nAmerica\u2019s back garden.\nAs an adolescent during the \u201860s, felix experimented with hallucinogenics\nand watched the world transform with\nthe explosion of television, the rise of\nfeminism and counterculture. Anti-war\nmovements instigated by America\u2019s involvement in Vietnam were rife as were\nattempts at procuring better civil rights,\nit was clear that the shape of politics\nwas undergoing a radical shift.\nOn to the 1970s, the worlds economies were slowing down indicating an\nend to the years of post-war prosperity.\nThe decade also saw a huge rise in terrorist acitivity around the world as well\nas a mass focus on civil rights.\nCatapaulting through the \u201880s and\n\u201890s, the Thatcherite years, the rise of\nNew Labour and the momentous fall of\nthe Berlin Wall, felix was there through\nit all.\nAnd so we decelerate, this decade has\nseen the escalation of terrorism, global\nrecession, the pessimism surrounding\nGordon Brown and the optimism associated with Barack Obama.\nLet us alight now from this political steam train, take a moment to reflect and appreciate how the world\nhas changed since 1949, and indeed\nhow felix has changed. As a student\nnewspaper we have enormous potential and hopefully 60 years from now\nfelix will continue to thrive and maybe,\njust maybe, I will have written another\ncolumn.\nKatya-yani Vyas Politics Editor Swiss ban minarets\nThis past Sunday the Swiss voted in a\nreferendum on the inclusion of a ban\non the construction of minarets into\nthe country\u2019s constitution.\nIn a surprise victory that has left\nSwiss leadership reeling, the Swiss\nPeople\u2019s Party\u2019s (SVP) vicious and controversial prohibition campaign won\n57.5% of the popular vote. Only four\nout of the 23 cantons (federal states)\nof the Confederation voted in opposition to the ban. Of the four, three are\nfrom francophone Switzerland (Ge-neva, Neuchatel and Vaud), with German-speaking Basel-City (technically\nonly a half-canton) the fourth. Voter\nturnout stood at around 55%.\nThe hard right SVP became the largest party in the Swiss parliament in\n2007, on the wave of an anti-immigra-tion campaign that has been criticised\nby even UN experts as being overtly\nracist. Past campaign propaganda has\nincluded a poster of two white sheep\nkicking a black sheep off the Swiss\nflag, and another where brown hands\nare portrayed reaching eagerly to grab\nat a Swiss passport. Their latest push,\nthis referendum, displayed minarets\nplaced on a Swiss flag and coloured to\nappear as missiles.\nThe SVP strove to portray minarets as symbols of rising Muslim religious and political power, campaigning against what they describe as the\n\u201crampant Islamisation\u201d of Swiss soci-ety. \u201cThe minaret has got nothing to do\nwith religion. It\u2019s a symbol of political\npower, a prelude to the introduction\nof sharia law,\u201d argues Ulrich Schl\u00fcer of\nthe SVP.\nBut these arguments seem only\nvaguely based on fact. Out of Switzerland\u2019s population of approximately 7.5\nmillion, only 6 percent are Muslim,\nmainly originating from the Balkan regions of Kosovo, Albania and Bosnia.\nFewer than 13% are actually practicing.\nAs far as minarets go, there are only\nfour in the entire country, with two\nsituated in Geneva. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t want\nany more,\u201d comes the baffling counter-argument from Schl\u00fcer. \u201cThere\u2019s no\nsense in banning them once you\u2019ve got\nhundreds. What\u2019s the point in waiting\nfor that?\u201d\nIn league with the SVP were secu-larist leftists and liberals fiercely critical of Islam and its practices, which\nthey deem sexist. According to these\ngroups, minarets are male power sym-bols, and their presence is indicative\nof the state\u2019s acceptance of the oppression of women.\nThe government and political main-stream, as well as the business com-munity, came out in strong opposition\nagainst the ban on the grounds of tol-erance, as well as very real fears of possible damage to important commercial relationships with Middle Eastern\ncountries, such as happened to Denmark in the wake of the Muhammad\ncartoon controversy. Justice Minister\nand member of the Federal Council\n(the body which serves as Switzerland\u2019s collective Head of State) Eveline\nWidmer-Schlumpf called the legitimacy entire process into question, declaring that a ban would breach anti-discrimination laws and rights to free\nreligious observance. Church leaders\nand the Jewish community also joined\nin support of Muslims in calling for\nthe proposed amendment to be reject-ed. As late as last week, the proposed\namendment looked on course for de-feat, with only 37% of voters indicating they supported a ban.\nThere are now fears of a backlash,\nboth economic, through disruption\nof trade ties with the Middle East, and\nsocial, via encouraging radicalisation.\nFor a country that has for centuries\navoided conflict by selling itself as politically neutral, and avoided becoming a target of fundamentalists like\nthe majority of Western states, the\nproposed addition to article 72 of the\nSwiss constitution represents a worrying development.\nAnthony Maina\nClimate change research: fraudulent and incorrect?\nNeil Dhir\nThe Anthropogenic Global Warming\n(AGW) hypothesis is, like many scientific exercises before it, no stranger\nto fraud. felix recently exposed the\nscandal at the East Anglia Climate\nResearch Unit (CRU). As we are constantly being fed the impending threat\nof Armageddon as a result of AGW\nit should come as no real surprise to\nanyone that the AGW hypothesis has\nbeen dipped in fraud, marinated in\nfraud, stewed in fraud, flavoured with\nfraud and finally served with a nice\nbottle of 1962 Chateau de Scientific\nBogus Obfuscation. But as we shall\nsee \u2018Climategate\u2019 is only the tip of the\niceberg, to use the proverbial phrase,\nin a long line of events which serve\nonly to dropkick the good name of\nscience in the bollocks. felix asks the\ndear reader to spot occurrences of scientific malpractice during the reading\nof this article. The right answers are\nposted at the end.\nA quick 101 on \u2018Climategate\u2019 is in\norder to get unfamiliar readers up to\ndate. Climategate is the name given to\nthe hacking of CRU where more than\n1,000 e-mails, 3,000 documents and\n160 MB of data were stolen and uploaded to various websites.\nWhat Climategate has revealed so\nfar is the coordinated effort in the US\nand UK of non-compliance with both\ncountries\u2019 Freedom of Information\nacts, and the apparent and widespread\nintent of defrauding the highest levels of international climate science\nbodies.\nWe begin with a very bizarre episode which involved a NASA team\nled by one James Hansen - a man who\nmakes Al Gore look like an AGW\nskeptic (Hansen has demanded that\nwarming \u201cdeniers\u201d be tried for \u201ccrimes\nagainst humanity\u201d).\nWhile examining a series of NASA\ntemperature graphs, Steve McIntyre\na statistician, who is best described\nas an anti-AGW Doctor Manhattan,\nuncovered a discontinuity occurring\nin January 2000 that raised temperatures gathered over widespread areas\nby 1-2 degrees (which in global warming world is like unicorn genocide using blunt spoons). Hansen refused to\nreveal what algorithm he had used to\nprocess the data. McIntyre thus began\nthe arduous process of figuring it out\nhimself and finally struck gold.\nOnce notified, Hansen\u2019s team promised to correct the error, stating that it\nwas an \u201coversight.\u201d When the corrected\nfigures were at last released, vanished\nwas the claim that the past few years\nwere \u201cthe warmest on record.\u201d Now\n1934 took precedence. A full half of the\ntop ten warmest years occurred before\nWWII, well prior to any massive CO2\nbuild-up.\nNo explanation has ever been of-fered. Which leave us with a very odd\nY2K glitch that behaves like no other\ncomputer glitch ever encountered,\nuniformly affecting a large number of\nsources distributed almost nationwide.\nAlthough the incident trashed all\nrecent data and raised uncomfortable\nquestions about the warming thesis as\na whole, NASA itself made no effort at\nan investigation or an attempt to clear\nthe issue up.\n3,000\nNumber of documents leaked\nin the \u2018Climategate\u2019 scandal\n1934\nThe warmest year on record\naccording to new NASA data\nTwo propaganda posters from the SVP promoting racism in Switzerland\n\n"

At that stage I had\nno idea how it would change my life,\nI just thought the guitar in the chorus\nsounded really cool! \u201cOkay, I Believe\nYou, But My Tommy Gun Don\u2019t\u201d was\nthe second song I heard from this album that day and I was blown away.\nI thought both songs were really\ncool, but back then I thought LOTS\nof songs were pretty cool and the\nplethora of bands I should listen to\nwas so massive that to buy every single\npromising album would have cost me\nroughly a year\u2019s worth of EMA payments (I worked it out). So luck made\nme buy this album with the strange\npicture of an astronaut on the cover.\nThe first track, \u201cTautou\u201d, was quiet\nand a little bit spacey and I initially\nthought the lyrics were repetitive\nand way too weird. I was worried. I\nthought I had bought a dodgy album.\nAnd then I heard \u201cSic Transit Gloria...\nGlory Fades\u201d.\nThat bass line, wow! I mean WOW!\nIt left me rooted to the spot. I felt that\na very horrible concept (like that of\nelectron-hole pairs) was careening\nstraight for me and there was nothing\nI could do to stop it. The feeling is de-licious, since this song tells the story\nof two people. The loss of the boy\u2019s\nvirginity is allegorised as a lamb being\ntaken to slaughter, so a feeling of anything other than the most oppressive\ndoom would devalue the lyrics.\nI had grown up listening to KoRn,\nLimp Bizkit and Slipknot, so the overwhelming use of acoustic-y sounding\nguitars did weird me out somewhat!\nBut the sheer arrogance of the lyrics \u201cI\nAlbums that you should know\nam Heaven sent\u201d and the insane overlay of voices in \u201cThe Quiet Things\u2026\u201d\nhad won me over by the end of track 5.\nI have enjoyed every track on this al-bum, but space is limited and I would\nlike to talk briefly about the final\ntrack, \u201cPlay Crack The Sky\u201d. The folk-feel and constant referencing to the\nsea gives the song an intimate \u201cfisherman\u2019s story\u201d feel. A beautiful, yet\nAndy Roast looks at modern classics that shaped music today\nBrand New\n\u2018Deja Entendu\u2019\nTriple Crown\n2003\nC\nelebrating its 10th year as an\nindependent label, Bristol\u2019s\nmuch beloved Tru Thoughts\nreleased a 3-CD \u201cbest of\u201d\ncompilation last month showcasing\nthe vast talent they have accumulated\nover the years. Considering that back\nin 1999, founders Robert Luis and Paul\nJonas started the label from an \u201coffice\u201d\nunder Luis\u2019 stairs, they haven\u2019t done\ntoo badly over the last 10 years.\nAlong the way they discovered great\nartists such as Bonobo or Chris Clark\n\u2013 who later moved on to bigger labels\nNinja Tune and Warp, respectively\n\u2013 and they still play host to the ever-prolific Quantic, in his many shapes\nand forms, the genre-hopping Nostalgia 77, or Australian super-heavy funk\ncombo The Bamboos.\nThe reason Tru Thoughts has become a label of guaranteed quality in\nthe sweetest of all grooves on display\nhere, punctuated by tight horns and\nsexy saxes.\nFor all the Tru Thoughts fans, this is\nan essential addition to the collection,\nclearly portraying how the label got to\nwhere it is today: by signing artists who\nare not afraid to take risks, break down\na pop song, and jazz it the fuck up.\nTo anybody who has not heard of\nTru Thoughts \u2013 or worse still, thinks\nthat jazz has been dead a long time \u2013\nthis might be the perfect introduction.\nAn album bursting with creativity and\na crash-course in reinvention.\nBad-ass jazz covers, cheers Tru Thoughts\ntoday\u2019s over-saturated musical world\nis most definitely down to their will\nto constantly reject the old saying that\nthe music business is \u201c99% business,\n1% music\u201d.\nTru Thoughts love the artists that\nthey sign, and they let them know it by\nreleasing this compilation of crossover\ncovers by Tru Thoughts acts.\nThe 17 tracks are either B-sides or\nexclusive tracks from the past 10 years,\ncollected for the first time here. Forget whether you have heard of the Tru\nThoughts roster: some of these are simply adventurous, hilarious and downright outstanding covers of songs everyone else has grown tired of by now.\nThink you\u2019ve heard the White\nStripes\u2019 \u201cSeven Nation Army\u201d so much\nyour ears bleed? Think again, you ain\u2019t\nheard it like this. The amazing Alice\nRussell, backed by Nostalgia 77, delivers a powerful soul version of this rock\nclassic, morphing it into a dark, dou-ble-bass heavy beast in its own right.\nQuantic and his Combo Barbaro\ngive a steaming afro-cuban rendition\nof Portishead\u2019s depresso-matic tune\n\u201cWandering Star\u201d that\u2019ll give Beth\nRowley something to really cry about.\nHot 8 Brass Band turn up the heat\nyet more by giving Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cSexual Healing\u201d a smooth jazz-makeover,\nputting you in the right mood for lovin\u2019.\nThe diversity of the label\u2019s acts is always on display: J. Viewz turn Michael\nJackson\u2019s \u201cSmooth Criminal\u201d into a\ntrip-hop song, and Jumbonics funk up\nthe Strokes on \u201cLast Nite\u201d.\nMy personal favourite has to be the\nmost improbable cover of \u201cPut Your\nHands Up For Detroit\u201d ever imag-ined.

Florence & TM\n9. Grizzly Bear\n10. Coldplay\nsad story detailing the decay and sudden end of a relationship caused by a\nmindless comment.\nAnd that\u2019s what I love about this al-bum, the lyrics tell stories. The stories\ndeal with real issues which we will all\nat one point have to cope with. I can\nstill listen to it (nearly six years later)\nand understand a song in a different\nway.\nGo to\nfelixmusicchart.tk\nI want to make it clear right\nnow that I have absolutely\nnothing to do with this\nchart. I don\u2019t believe you\ncare what other people you\ndon\u2019t know are listening to,\nand neither do I. Knowing\nthat so many people are\nlistening to Coldplay is a\nsad truth I\u2019d rather not\nhave known. - Alex\nA\nghostly night of picturesque\nfolk beauty, peace and a\ntouch of Leonard Cohen,\nwas what I was unaware of\nas I departed to a dark corner of Kilburn where nestled The Luminaire. It\nwas not the night for me to riot to indie\ndistortion or break my ears with the\nfrequencies of bass, however, I was a\nvirgin to Musee Mecanique and Laura\nGibson and was prepared for anything,\nand so took the step from the icy street\ninto The Luminaire.\nSpeechlessness was my first feeling\nwhen I got inside and Musee Mecanique had just broken the quiet with\ntheir first song. The small black and\nvelvet red venue was completely silent\napart from the gentle acoustic guitar\nand hum of the keyboard from the duo\non the stage, Musee Mecanique. There\nwas a large handful of people all sat\non the floor infront of the pair, almost\nnobody standing, the atmosphere was\nexactly as it should be. Although the\nmusic played, you could have heard a\nmouse, and the people were completely focused on the sound being made,\njust as it is meant to be.\nMusee Mecanique played soft music,\nwith gentle talented voices. At times\nendearingly out of tune, this seemed\nunimportant as the vibe of the room\nsaw past this, as if they were having a\nsoul-to-soul with us, truly showing us\nemotion.\nThe pair had an unbelievable musical connection as they paused and\ncontinued flawlessly. Taking a change\nof instruments they both play guitar,\none acoustic and one classical and begin by performing minutes of gentle a\nMusee Mecanique & Laura Gibson @ The Luminaire\nLuke Turner believes in ghosts after a night at The Luminaire\ncapella in beautiful tune and harmony.\nThe skill of these musicians can\u2019t be\ndoubted, each playing more than one\ninstrument at once on occasion. Leaving the stage humbly the room was left\nwhispering, this was a new take on folk\nmusic for me.\nI was impatient to hear what Laura\nGibson was to add to this formula and\nby this time the entire floor was filled\nwith cross-legged spectators. She appeared on stage as a ghost-like figure,\nvintage white dress and pale, she was\nfollowed by Musee Mecanique who\nwere to accompany her set. She gently\nplucked her acoustic, with keyboard\nand various stringed instruments being played by her aides. Not only did\nthe image on stage appear ghostly, the\nsound was calm and peaceful, it was a\ntransfixing scene. Her music was slow\nand played with feeling, her voice was\nsweet and there was real fluid connectivity of all the sounds being made,\nsome echoing others, some giving res-onance, flowing with the smoke rings\nof my mind, it fitted serenely. Some\nof her songs had pretty two-vocal\nparts, but her melodies seemed to lack\ndirection.\nShe sweet talked the crowd between\nsongs that otherwise would have\nblended together, and towards the\nend of her set the atmosphere was a\ndream world. Her lyrics seemed to be\npersonal, as if it was surreal story time\nand we were her children. She ended\nher set with a Leonard Cohen cover of\n\u2018Take This Waltz\u201d, humble, as she knew\nfew people knew her own music.

    "content": "14 felix FRIDAY 04 DECEMBER 2009\nBUSINESS\nBusiness Editor\nBusiness Editor Sina Ataherian\nSina Ataherian\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTenuously related events from 1949\nIn celebration of our newspaper\u2019s sixtieth birthday, we look at a few stories from the year felix were founded\n1949 saw the registering of Adidas,\nand the approximate start of it being\na global household name. It deserves\na brief mention here as an example of\ncompanies of its type gaining greater\nimportance in the second half of the\nlast century than ever before. In par-ticular, it provides an excuse to defend\none of the main charges frequently levelled against it and similar firms, that\nthey use \u2018sweatshops.\u2019\nJust to be clear, some developing\nworld workshops referred to by this\nphrase deceive and even force vulnerable workers into working for them.\nIn other cases no one is coerced into\nworking at a particular establishment,\nbut illegal force is brought to bear\nagainst anyone trying to organise any\nform of unionisation. This is a serious\nproblem that public pressure has admirably done much to tackle in recent\ndecades, with the support of dedicated\ncampaign groups often proving vital.\nBut such businesses represent a tiny\nfraction of those tarnished by the label of sweatshop, and are certainly not\nsuppliers to the major western brands\nthat attract so much criticism on the\nissue. In fact, all that is usually enough\nto qualify a place of work in a developing country as a sweatshop is working conditions that would make it an\nundesirable employer for the activists\nthat attack them. However undesirable a certain firm appears, it must still\nbe better than the next best available\noption; otherwise no one would freely\nchoose to work there.\nSo complaining that Adidas or anyone else is \u2018exploiting workers\u2019 essentially amounts to saying that you are\nunhappy that there is inequality in the\nworld. This may be cause for concern,\nbut few sweatshop-bashers would\nwant businesses boycotted for not respecting absolute financial equality\nfor all workers. If it is more an issue\nof their being a \u2018minimum standard,\u2019\nthe furthest from it are certainly not\nthe sweatshop workers, who by definition work. Concerned individuals are\nalready welcome to donate their own\nmoney.\nRelaxing immigration controls\nwould also even out global imbalances and lead to greater economic\nefficiency at the same time. But other\nthan that, as regrettable as some may\nfind inequality, it cannot in and of itself be cause for sanctioning individual\nbusinesses. Instead, Adidas and its like\nshould be thanked for slightly lessening the gap through their job-creation.\nOf course that still does not excuse the\nlameness of their TV ads.\nSexual orientation-specific advertising has been criticised repeatedly both on ethical grounds and for marketing reasons:\n10% of the population is a fairly small market segment\nThe Second World War spurred a\ngreat amount of creativity and innovation in a number of academic fields, including Economics. The years following the war saw major developments in\nthe discipline, including a sharpening\nof the dividing lines between free-mar-ket versus interventionist schools of\nthought. 1949 contained two important examples.\nOne of these examples never\namounted to anything of note in itself,\nbut offers an interesting glimpse into\nthe birth of the idea that the whole\neconomy can be viewed at the \u2018macro\u2019\nlevel and planned with scientific preci-sion. This was the Monetary National\nIncome Analogue Computer (MO-NIAC), designed and built by Alban\nWilliam Housego Phillips, famous for\nhis curves.\nBetter known as the Phillips Hydraulic Computer, the contraption is still\navailable for viewing at the London\nSchool of Economics, where it was\nfirst unveiled in, of course, 1949. As\nthe name suggests it models the British economy with a hydraulic device,\nwhere water plays the role of money\ncirculating through the various com-partments. The machine looks like\nsomething from scrapheap challenge,\nusing tanks, pipes, valves, and water pumped by a motor made out of\nthe windscreen wiper of a Lancaster\nbomber.\nProfessor Phillips tried to show income flowing around the economy and\nbeing shared between consumer, government and business spending using\ndyes channeled by a fishing line and\nbits of plastic. He and his collaborator,\nWalter Newlyn, decided on this design only after careful experimentation\nwith methylated spirits and treacle as\npotential alternatives. Compared to\nits successors found today in the form\nof powerful computers in the quantitative analytics departments of large\ninvestment banks, the machine was\nfairly basic. Ironically, it ignored such\nphenomena as inflation and the business cycle.\nThe machine came at a time of great\nhardship. The entire economy was facing major restructuring and people\nwere disgusted to see so much material suffering and idle resources in their\ndaily lives. There was strong demand\nfor a short cut to remedy the situation,\nto get the idle resources working again\nand return the country back to its days\nof wealth and prosperity. The Phillips\nmachine was a significant milestone\nfor advocates of central macro-plan-ning as a means of achieving maximum state control over the economy\nin the most important but least personally intrusive way.\nThe thinking underlying the machine is still alive and well, with central planners at the Federal Reserve\npursuing the policy of damaging the\neconomy with distortionary interventions and then suggesting worse attacks against the markets as a remedy.\nAll other central banks essentially act\nin reaction to its decisions and so are\nnot really important enough to merit\nindividual mention. The similarities\nof the principles of the Philips model\nwith those used by the Fed to determine how much and where to intervene today is striking.\nAlthough the late forties were a particularly strong time for poor economic\ntheories being popularised by the desperation of the people, they were also\nan excellent time for the propagation\nof much sounder thinking throughout\nthe Anglo-Saxon world. The persecution of German and Austrian Jews,\nwho of course provided most of the\ncountry\u2019s economists, forced many of\nthem to leave for the United States. A\nnotable example, probably the greatest\neconomist of the last century, was Ludwig von Mises. In 1949 he wrote his\nmagnum opus, Human Action, which\nto this day remains one of the greatest\ntreaties on free market economics and\nthe principle of sound money.\nThe central thesis of the book is that\neconomics is fundamentally different\nfrom the natural sciences. Whereas\nin those we may measure things and\nguess at conclusions based on our\nmeasurements, this would be an ineffective method when dealing with\nhuman behaviour. Instead Mises proposed basing an economic theory on\npraxeology. This is the study of how\npeople behave, based on our a priori\nunderstanding of rationality and moti-vation. He wrote of his book:\n\u201cEconomics does not allow any\nbreaking up into special branches. It\ninvariably deals with the interconnect-edness of all phenomena of acting and\neconomising. All economic facts mutually condition one another. Each of\nthe various economic problems must\nbe dealt with in the frame of a comprehensive system assigning its due place\nand weight to every aspect of human\nwants and desires.\nI saw the forces operating which\ncould not but annihilate the high civilization and prosperity of Europe. In\nwriting my book, I was hoping to contribute to the endeavors of our most\neminent contemporaries to prevent this\ncountry from following the path which\nleads to the abyss.\u201d Sadly the book, even\nthe German version written eight years\nearlier, did little to mitigate the actions\nof the Nazi regime as Mises hoped.\nAdidas\nChina\nThe founding of the People\u2019s Republic and the fleeing of the Kuomintang\ngovernment to Taiwan were clearly\nvery important 1949 events. But they\nwere both such complex events that it\nobviously would not do them justice to\nelaborate here.\nBut they would have been fairly glaring omissions had they been ignored\naltogether in a piece on the significant\nevents of 1949.\nProfessor Phillips\u2019s MONIAC is a far cry from its current successors\nPhillips Machine Human Action\n\n"

If you\u2019ve got a passion for\ntechnology and have got something to say then get involved!\nEmail us at: technology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIf it\u2019s something decent you might even end up in felix one week.\nWelcome to the World\nof Tomorrow....\nTechnology Editor Samuel Gibbs takes a quick look back in the\nannals of history to what 1949 gave the world of technology\nTablet Crunched\nno more\nT\nhis week saw one of my most\nanticipated devices of 2009-2010 go the way of the Dodo\njust before release. I\u2019m talking about the CrunchPad, Michael\nArrington\u2019s attempt to create an internet tablet built around a 10.2\u201d touch\nscreen and the Intel Atom processor.\nThe promise of a couch-friendly touch\nscreen tablet for around the $300\nmark was pretty tempting. Up until\nnow, prototypes and mock-ups have\nall looked great with Arrington hoping to unveil the CrunchPad for mass\nproduction this week. News came two\ndays before the official launch that\na fall-out between TechCrunch and\ntheir manufacturing partner has put\nthe kibosh on the CrunchPad.\nA post on TechCrunch said that\nFusion Garage, the manufacturer of\nthe fabled device, had decided to go\nit alone and make the device without\nTechCrunch. As Arrington put it so\nsuccinctly, it\u2019s like:\n\u2018...Foxconn, who build the iPhone,\nnotifying Apple a couple of days before\nlaunch that they\u2019d be moving ahead\nand selling the iPhone directly without\nany involvement from Apple.\n\u2019\nThe problem for Fusion Garage is\nthat both it and CrunchPad, the team\nfrom TechCrunch, own the intellectual\nproperty behind the internet tablet. So,\nhowever they proceed, it\u2019s eventually\ngoing to be the Court\u2019s decision as to\nwhether this hotly-anticipated device\never makes it to market. The irony here\nis that Arrington is no stranger to IP\nbattles and infringement, as he\u2019s willing to publish any and all leaked data\nand information, as he aptly showed\nwith posts containing Twitter\u2019s business model and their plans to monetise\nthe free service.\nIn other news this week, Google\nhas killed off development of Gears\nnow that HTML 5 is making head-way. Google\u2019s plan for Gears was to\nintroduce the concept of rich, offline\nweb apps like Google Docs, Wave and\nGmail and force adoption of a standard\nthat did away with the need for plugins like HTML 5. Now that its mission\nis complete, Gears will cease development but be maintained for the near\nfuture, as more and more browsers become HTML 5-compliant.\nTalking about web apps, Facebook\nthis week decided to do away with regional networks in an effort to bolster\nuser privacy. It also made changes to\nmany of its privacy settings to help\nprotect its 350m users.\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\nT\nT\nWeekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed\nAnother week in Tech has flown by as\nwe head into December and the inevitable Christmas rush. This week we\u2019ve\nhad the good, the bad and the downright ugly rear their heads in the world\nof consumer technology.\nIn a break from tradition we\u2019ll start\nwith the bad. Virgin Media announced\nthis week that it would be doing some\nsnooping into 40% of its customers\u2019 traffic using a technology called\nCView, which conducts Deep Packet\nInspection (DPI) in an effort to determine the rate of music piracy across its\nnetwork. Yes that\u2019s right, Virgin is going to examine everything that goes to\nand from your computer if you happen\nto be in the 40%. What does this really\nmean? Well if you\u2019re pirating music\nacross an unencrypted network like\nBitTorrent, VM will know and what\nthey\u2019ll do about it is unknown. Virgin\nare set to launch a music service in\nconjunction with Universal and their\nofficial line is that they want to gauge\npiracy levels. I don\u2019t know about you,\nbut piracy or not, I don\u2019t want people\nsnooping at everything I do or send\nacross the Internet including email,\nIM, Waves and surfing.\nabout the ugly? Are you living off\nDaddy\u2019s trust fund or have recently\ncome into a load of money? Do you\nhave \u00a31.92m burning a hole in your\npocket? Well I\u2019ve got just the thing for\nyou. How about a solid gold iPhone\nencrusted with 136 flawless diamonds\njust in the front bezel? The iPhone 3GS\nsupreme features a very rare, single\ncut, 7.1 carat diamond for a home button and 53 flawless diamonds making\nup the Apple logo on the back. Nice.\nOn with the good with more Apple\nrumours this week. Apple names its\nhardware via strict numerical numbering system, a single generation\nnumber followed by a decimal iteration number. An iPhone identified as\n3,1 has been spotted by a software\nanalytics program operating in the San\nI\nf you\u2019ve got this far into felix\nthis week you should know by\nnow that it\u2019s our 60th birthday.\nTo commemorate the rather\nfine achievement of 60 years\nin print, we\u2019re going to take you back\nto 1949, sixty years in the past, to see\nwhat technology was like in our first\nyear in print.\nTechnology, if you can call it that,\nwas very different back then as you\ncan imagine. Computers had only just\nstarted to make moves within the institutions of learning whilst Microsoft,\nApple and other behemoths of the 21st\ncentury era weren\u2019t even a twinkle in a\nlucky man\u2019s eye.\n1949, apart from giving us household\nnames such as Sigourney Weaver and\nArsene Wenger, also debuted some impressive tech for the time. January 17th\nsaw the first VW Beetle roll into New\nYork to a decidedly lacklustre recep-tion. Despite VW\u2019s best efforts, only\ntwo 1949 models were sold in the US\nthat year. A bad start, but it wasn\u2019t all\nbad as the Beetle was set to become\nthe greatest automobile phenomenon\ncircumnavigation of the globe in their\nBoeing B-50 Superfortress bomber,\nvoyage. The British-designed de Havilland Comet was the first-ever commercial jet to reach full-scale produc-tion. The early Comet models suffered\nfrom catastrophic metal fatigue, not\nsomething you would want travelling\nat several hundred miles an hour, and\nhad to be withdrawn from service for\na redesign resulting in the Comet 4 se-ries. Derivatives of the Comet are still\nin service today including the Nimrod\nMRA4 which is set to see the RAF out\nuntil the 2020\u2019s.\nAugust 29th 1949 saw the Soviet\nUnion test its first atomic bomb codenamed Joe 1, which borrowed heavily\nfrom the plutonium bomb dropped on\nNagasaki in 1945 by the US.\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor Francisco area. The current iPhone\n3GS carries an iPhone 2,1 identifier\nand it was spotted in much the same\nway in testing in October 2008, eight\nmonths before it\u2019s eventual release.\nWhat does this mean? Well, we already\nknew Apple was likely to release a new\niPhone in just over 6 months time, but\nthe 3,1 identifier indicates that Apple\nwill consider this a major hardware re-fresh. Whether this means a move to a\nPA Semi ARM chip, an OLED screen\nor a forward facing camera for mobile\niChat is anyone\u2019s guess.\nSpeaking of video calling, Fring\nbrought one-way video calling to the\niPhone this week with an app update.\nWhile one-way video is not particularly useful, given hardware limitations,\nit\u2019s better than nothing right?\nin American history.\nMarch 2nd 1949 saw the first ever\nnon-stop around-the-world flight by\nthe aptly-named Lucky Lady II. It took\nCaptain James Gallagher and his crew\nof 14 just under four days to make the\nwith four in-air refuelings on the way.\nOn May 23rd 1949, EDSAC, the first\nstored-program computer, kicked into\nlife at Cambridge\u2019s Mathematical Laboratory. Consisting of mercury delay\nlines for memory and derated vacuum\ntubes for logic, with data inputted via\n5-hole punched tape and outputting via\na teleprinter it certainly didn\u2019t resemble\nthe modern PC. The EDSAC, however,\ncame packed with something rather\nspecial. It shipped with the world\u2019s\nfirst, albeit rather primitive, assembler,\nwhich it could be argued was the start\nof the global software industry that we\nknow and love today. Another British\ntechnological first, like the Internet,\nwithout which we wouldn\u2019t have many\nof things we couldn\u2019t live without today.\nJune 8th 1949 saw the publication\nof one of science fiction\u2019s most celebrated and culturally significant books\nof all time, George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen\nEighty-Four. The book told of a society under total control from the top,\nwhere independent thought was removed and its people suppressed. It\nalso introduced the idea of Big Brother,\nwatching your every move, something\nwe\u2019re moving closer and closer to in today\u2019s society.\nAnother truly revolutionary first that\ntook place in 1949 on July 27th was the\nfirst ever jet-powered airliner\u2019s maiden\nMore from the military, the first of\nthe 20mm M61 Vulcan Gatling gun\nprototypes was produced and tested\nin 1949. Various derivatives of the\nimpressive Vulcan cannon as it was\nknown are still used in almost all fixed-wing military aircraft today. The M61\nalso gave birth to the M134, which\nyou\u2019ll probably know by the name\nMinigun. Yes, that\u2019s right, that hulking\nmassive gun that the Governor of California had to be strapped to the floor\nto fire freehand in Terminator 2.\n1949, the year that gave us Big Brother, felix and the jet airliner.\nWell that\u2019s the bad out the way, how\n\n"

An infant of\nonly two years old, the dodgeball club\nchallenged the UK\u2019s leading teams at\nthe London tournament last Saturday.\nThe tournament began with our first\nteam sweeping 5-0 victories against\ntwo well-established clubs as well as\nthe second team securing an initial\nvictory of 5-0 but our juggernaut-like\nperformance was halted by the \u2018Jammy\ndodgers\u2019. The \u2018Jammy dodgers\u2019 who\nhave won the University championship on two occasions and one of their\nmembers has had his throw measured:\nhe can fire a dodgeball at speeds up to\n65mph (105kmph). The 1st\u2019s enjoyed\nan early lead but our valiant efforts\nwere thwarted by our lack of tournament experience meanwhile the 2nd\u2019s\nencountered another goliath of an\nopponent. They faced a team whose\naverage throw speed was 50mph and\ncontained an unnameable beast with\nafro-like hair that has been measured\nto fire a dodgeball at up to 85mph. The\n2nd\u2019s saw some inhumane dodging\nfrom their captain, Jag and Alby but\neven they were overcom.\nThe tournament progressed with a\nfantastic series of dodgers from members of both teams with a significant\nmajority of thrown dodgeballs being\nsuccessfully dodged by the players\nin each team. Two years of dodgeball\nwithin the tight space of the Union\nDining Hall had sharpened our dodging skills but weakened our throwing abilities. But both teams battled\nforward courageously and the 1st\u2019s\nsteam-rolled our way into the semi-finals, faced the 85mph thrower and\nhis team but gave a fantastic fight\nwith one match where we eliminated\ntheir entire team with no losses. But\na dodgeball match consists of 5 games\nand we were narrowly defeated 3-2 by\nthe Leicester Ligers.\nThe contrast between the Leicester Ligers, a team in white Lycra kits\npatterned with meticulously designed\ntiger-like creatures that had a surrealism that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in\na Dali painting and our \u00a31.98 white\nPrimark T-shirts with black-marker\npenned numbers on the back emphasised our tournament inexperience but\nthis also highlighted the potential of\nImperial college\u2019s dodgeball team. A\nteam who after only one year can challenge the UK\u2019s top teams and this was\nDodgeballprogression\nChristopher Jones Dodgeball\nrecognised by the tournament organisers who proudly awarded our 1st team\nwith a team achievement award. The\norganisers described our 1st team as\n\u2018the best performance seen by a team\nin their first tournament ever!\u2019 and this\nwas also a distinguishing characteristic\nof the 2nd team as well.\nDodgeball is considered a joke sport.\nAn offshoot from a witty film with\nVince Vaughn (and others) and recently quoted by Boris Johnson in his description in the things he must do as a\npolitician (\u2018Dodge, duck, dip, dive and\ndodge\u2019). It hasn\u2019t received the most serious publicity but there are almost 200\nteams in the UKDBA league (approx.\n100 of which are university teams).\nThe university championships will test\nour team to its new experienced limits\nand it is unacceptable to have a lesser\nuniversity as the university dodgeball\nchampions \u2013 especially if it is Warwick\nwho currently hold the title.\nA dodgeballer launching a ball at speeds well over 50 miles per hour; that could kill a man\n\n"

    "content": "3\nfelix FRIDAY 09 DECEMBER 1949\npipes of other veterans.\nAfter lunch \u201cBo\u201d was moved to the pavillion where\nthe Mayor\u2019s tea was to be held. It was here that further\npreparations were carried out for the return journey. This\ntea was the high spot of the day and perhaps it was not\nstrictly true to say that all \u201cBo\u2019s\u201d crew and followers\nwere invited, but all attended in the true Imperial College\nfashion.\nDuring the tea it was learnt that \u201cBo\u201d had been\ndisqualified for indulging in excessive speed. The day\nwas drawing into evening and the return journey had to be\nfaced. This was quite uneventful except that \u201cBo\u201d was very\nreluctant to forego further refreshments as were the crew.\nThe taxi-horn was used to full advantage whilst\nthe crowds in \u201cPiccadilly\u201d were given a fine exhibition of\ncircular motoring with Mr. Carruthers in the chair. Finally\nthe commissionaire at the Dorchester was allowed to use\nhis voice in order to stop \u201cBo\u201d entering, so \u201cBo\u201d reluctantly\nreturned to college, decidedly hot under the bonnet.\nLetters to the Editor.\nSir,\nIn view of the ever increasing popularity of Saturday night \"hops\", and the impossibly\novercrowded conditions which are resulting, I feel we should tolerate no longer those men\nfrom outside the college who seem to regard our Union as a Palais de Danse. Officials of the\nUnion should ensure that a responsible person is stationed at each door of the Union, not\nthe dance floor, who shall ask for the Union card of everyone who is not personally known\nto him, and members of the College should evict with the utmost vigour and loss of apparel\nany uninvited guest who does succeed in entering.\nYours etc.\nWallflower.\nSir,\nIt appears that there is a strange race in our midst. This body of men apparently\nfind it necessary to operate pneumatic drills behind the Albert Hall, whose neighbouring\nbuildings do nothing to muffle the shattering noise, at the ungodly hour of 7.30 a.m. when all\nright minded people are abed, When the disturbed sleepers are eventually forced out of their\nbeds by thoughts of breakfast or the 10 o'clock lecture, a strange silence envelops the Hostel\nprecincts and the drills are stilled.\nThis, Sir, is beyond my comprehension. Can it be they bear us some malice?.\nYours etc.\nD. C. Howe.\nDear Sir,\nIn a mild sort of way I would like to register a bitter protest about the Union beer.\nPerhaps one of our own tame entomologists could recommend to our so called Brewers a\nmore virile type of Gnat.\nUlcerated.\nDear Sir,\nThe publication of Felix provides a long overdue opportunity for Union members to\nexpress their views on many day to day items which would not normally find their way into\nUnion Meetings, and even for this alone it promises to be a most valuable organ.\nAmong many minor irritations a case on which I feel strongly is the price of\nsandwiches in the New Lounge. That cakes should cost 3d is perhaps excusable. For those who\ndesired a less extravagant tea there were at one time many sandwiches at 2d and excellent\njam sandwiches at l\u00bdd. Now the sandwiches are as dear as the cakes and to choose a \"cheap\"\ntea: is to face starvation.\nIn any case, Sir, can a charge of threepence really be justified for two thin half\nslices of bread with a thin smear or ersatz compound between them?\nYours etc.\nS.C.M.Taylor .\nSPORTS REVIEW.\nWith this first issue of \u201cFelix\u201d it has been decided\nto show readers the present position of the Colleges in the\nsports field by giving a summary of the results of the three\nprincipal winter games played throughout the Michaelmas\nterm.

EDITOR-IN-CHIEF DAN WAN\nREPORTS ON SOUTH KENSINGTON\u2019S \u00a325m REVAMP\nA\ns thousands of students\nswiftly make their way\ndown Exhibition Road\neach morning, they career around tourists\nstanding in the middle of the pavement,\nmap at full stretch, oblivious to anyone\nelse\u2019s urgency.\nThe main road of Imperial\u2019s campus\nis now subject to one of the many redevelopments of public areas in London.\nWork has already started at the underground station at Thurloe Place; within\nthe next three years the repaving works\nwill make its way north towards Hyde\nPark. felix spoke to Councillor Nicholas Paget-Brown and Mahmood Siddiqi\nfrom the Royal Borough of Kensington\nand Chelsea, both leaders of the ongoing \u2018Exhibition Road Project\u2019\n.\nThe vision for the new Exhibition\nRoad is to turn it into a \u201cworld-class\nstreetscape\u201d\n. What does that actually\nmean?\nWorld-class is an overused phrase, I\nthink. What it means is that we are very\nconscious that Exhibition Road was\nonce called Britain\u2019s intellectual high\nstreet. It would be, in any other city in\nthe world, a splendid avenue, but actually if you look at it at the moment, it\u2019s\nnot that. It doesn\u2019t reflect the beauties\nand glories of the collections inside\nthese really internationally renowned\ninstitutions, but is a very ordinary road\nlinking them all together from a small\ninsignificant underground station. It\nwas a real opportunity to not just repave\nthe streets, but to really try and get a top\nquality design and feel that could make\nan attractive place for the 11.5 million\npeople a year that visit the area. That\u2019s\nthe same number of people that visit\nVenice, so what we want is a beautiful\nroad.\nDo you see it attracting more people\nafter the development has finished?\nI don\u2019t suppose it will in its own right,\nbut what we do want is people coming\nto see the museums who would like to,\nbut currently can\u2019t because of the accessibility issues. Part of the design is to\ngo to a single surface: instead of having\npavements and roads, we\u2019ll put it all on\none level.\nHow much consultation was there\nwith Imperial College and their students during the design process, and\nongoing process?\nImperial\u2019s part of the Exhibition\nRoad Cultural Group [ERCG] so they\nare represented on that panel. Professor Michael Bell and at least four PhD\nstudents at Imperial are working closely\nwith us with research projects on the\nconcept of this single surface and how\nit will work and interact with vehicles.\nA lot of Imperial students get very\nfrustrated with the lack of space on\nthe pavements due to excessive tourist crowds, especially by Imperial\nThe locals\u2019 point of view\nCollege Road. Are there any plans to\nwiden the walking areas of the new\n\u2018single surface\u2019?\nYes, the plan is that the western side\nwill be a much wider pedestrian area:\n8 metres without a kerb. That should\nallow a much steadier pedestrian flow\nand provide better access to Imperial\nCollege\u2019s main entrance at the Tanaka\nBuilding. It should be a lot better.\nWhat does it mean for the rest of\nExhibition Road\u2019s carriage way if\nthe designated pedestrian area is\nwidening?\nThe next zone, if you like, we are calling the intermediate zone where you\ncan drop people off, but it has disabled and cycle parking. It\u2019ll be another\nstretch right the way up Exhibition\nRoad which will be distinct from the\npedestrian zone.\nThe carriageway for cars will be narrowed to two lanes rather than a dual-carriageway with parked cars along\neach side. It\u2019ll be a 20mph zone.\nWe\u2019re tending to stick to the term \u2018single surface\u2019 with this project, there is no\nobvious curb or delineation. The way it\nhas been designed, it will be obvious to\nthe driver which bit they will be limiting\nthemselves too.\nSo it is a rebalance really. Something\nwe\u2019ve tried to do throughout the bor-ough, like in High Street Kensington\nand Holbein Place in Sloane Square.\nWe\u2019re trying to rebalance the street in\nfavour of pedestrians and less in favour\nof the motorist.\nWhat stage is the project at currently and is the project on schedule\nso far? When is the project due to be\ncompleted?\nWe\u2019d like it to be finished early 2012,\nbefore the Olympics and Diamond Jubilee basically. There are 2 main phases\nto the project, and the first is nearly\ncompleted. That is the unravelling of\nthe 1960s one way system round South\nKen station. The traffic signals will have\nchanged by 6th December and you\u2019ll see\nit in its final form. There\u2019ll be also an\nenvironmental benefit. Instead of having to go three sides around a square,\nthere\u2019ll be straight roads, and it should\ncut car journeys\u2019 emissions and mileage.\nThe real benefit is for pedestrians\nthough. There\u2019ll be a traffic free environment for pedestrians to step out into.\nWilltheSouthendofExhibitionRoad\nthat forms the corner with Thurloe\nStreet become more of open piazza\nfor the small cafes and businesses directly out of the station?\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019d like, for it to be a\nmuch more pedestrian friendly area as\nyou come out the tube station. It should\ncreate the opportunity for the small cafes and bookshops to be part of a very\nattractive part of the world as you come\nout of the north side of the station and\nhead towards the museums. The very\ndistinctive paving will start here too and\nwill go all the way up Exhibition Road.\nDo you think the new shared space\nwill open Prince\u2019s Gardens up to the\npublic and passers-by?\nOur idea will encourage indiscriminate movement of pedestrians, and\nI think part of the problem is that\nyou have a dual carriageway running\nthrough the Imperial College campus.\nSo the project will open up Prince\u2019s\nGardens and locations on both sides of\nthe road.\nSo pedestrians are encouraged to\ncross at any point?\nIndeed, yes. The best comparison is\nHigh Steet Kensington where we removed hundreds of metres of pedestrian guard railing, and put cycle racks\ndown the middle of the road. It positively encouraged people to cross the\nfull length of the road. Accident statistics show a reduction in rates.\nWe also saw this with the new diagonal crossings at Oxford Circus. It\nwas balletic in a way, but it all worked\nremarkably well. I suppose people are\nlooking and taking care and see what\u2019s\ngoing on around them, and that\u2019s what\nwe hope will happen on Exhibition\nRoad.\nThis \u2018single surface\u2019 road is designed\nto create a safe environment for pe-destrians, and pushes the idea of \u2018giving back responsibility to all road users\u2019\n. Is it not inevitable that someone\nwill abuse or ignore this responsibil-ity, putting the other users of the road\nat a much larger risk than on a con\u201cWe\u2019re trying to\nrebalance the street in\nfavour of pedestrians\nand less in favour of\nthe motorist.\u201d\nTheeverydaylifeofpeoplearoundSouthKensington\nand Exhibition Road has been and will be largely\naffected the ongoing redevelopment works. felix\ncaught up with the owners of local businesses,\nstudents from Imperial College, visiting tourists and\ncurrent residents to see what extent the Exhibition\nRoad Project has changed their everyday lives.\nPlenty of small, independent businesses operate\naround the tube station and the south end of\nExhibition Road. In March 2009, work commenced\naround Thurloe Place and the roads around the tube\nstations were closed off to traffic.\nDavina Cheung, manager of Bookthrift bookshop\n(pictured), saw immediate detriment to her\nbusinesss, \u201cIt was definitely quiet, and the bus stops\nmoving definitely made a difference.\u201d Buses heading\nwest (Putney, Roehampton) were also diverted\naroundThurloePlace.\u201cIt\u2019saneyesore,buteventually\nit will all be worth it.\u201d\n\n"

But this comparison is only partly accurate. The Blair\nWitch Project pioneered the shaky,\nhandheld camera style seen here,\nbut countless horror films since have\nhopped on the bandwagon so much\nso that an entirely new subgenre has\nspawned for example Cloverfield, Diary of the Dead, [Rec] and My Little Eye. Without spoiling it too much\n(and frankly, if you\u2019re reading a review\nabout a film like this, which thrives\non surprises, you probably don\u2019t care\nfor spoilers) Paranormal Activity is\nthematically closer to the recent Drag\nMe To Hell, just not nearly in the same\nleague.\nA young couple living in San Diego\nsuburbia choose to document their\nlife from the moment things begin going bump in the night. The first half of\nthe film trundles along steadily while\nit is established whether the sceptical\nMicah really is taking his girlfriend\nKatie\u2019s paranoia seriously, or whether\nhe just wants to film the pair getting\ndown to some \u2018extra curricular\u2019 activ-ity. Micah\u2019s obsession with gadgets\nleads him to rigging up microphones\naround the bedroom and using the\ncamera\u2019s infra-red mode to film while\nthey sleep. Doors open on their own\naccord, personal belongings are mysteriously misplaced and chandeliers\nswing despite all the windows being\nlocked in the house.\nThe atmosphere trembles, slowly\nboiling but too often the tension is cut\nwith images of Katie\u2019s arse or Micah\nrequesting a striptease. Thrust a camera into the hands of a warm-blooded\nmale, especially one with an infra-red\nmode, and thoughts will probably turn\nto recreating One Night In Paris or\nsomething equally salacious, but the\nwhole premise of the film is that the\ntapes have been discovered, dusted off\nand their contents released to show\nthe horrors lurking in the celluloid. Retaining the tits and arse when cutting\ntogether a week\u2019s worth of footage isn\u2019t\nthe most respectful way of remembering the missing or deceased\u2019s final days.\nThe editor\u2019s hand is far too apparent.\nThe Blair Witch Project succeeded\nso brilliantly as you rarely felt aware\nof the camera, and because there was\nsuch little editing between scenes, the\nfilm felt like raw footage. In Paranormal Activity you are acutely aware of\nthe camera\u2019s presence as every other\nscene references it in some way and\nthis is ultimately at the detriment to\nthe toe-curling tension.\nThe whole point of the handheld\ntechnique is to heighten the sense of\nreality and immersion. Cloverfield\nmanaged this despite featuring a gargantuan monster, but Paranormal\nActivity just feels contrived and no\namount of shaky-cam is going to rescue it. The story is pure hokum. I\u2019m\nprobably stirring the depths of hell by\nsaying this, but the people who believe\nin demons and ghosts are the same\nidiots that think global warming is a\nhoax. Drag Me To Hell, as well as Sam\nRaimi\u2019s earlier films such as Evil Dead,\nrecognised the absurdity of the spiritual world as well as its believers, and\ntook great pleasure in making a joke\nout of them while creating effective,\nscary horror films. Paranormal Activity takes such laughable subject matter\nfar too credibly.\nAlas! The Blair Witch Project is still\nthe queen of the shaky-cam genre;\nParanormal Activity on the other hand\nis what you\u2019d get if you asked the Big\nBrother producers to remake The\nExorcist.\nfelix is sixty! So here\u2019s sixty years of the great and iconic cinema landmarks\nFirst we had stereophonic, now prepare yourself for stereoscopic! As the\n22nd Academy awards draw closer\nand the bookies place their odds on\nthe contenders, a small band of renegades are causing ripples among\nthe film community. They claim that\nsoon they will be able to make pictures\njump out at us in 3 dimensions. That\u2019s\nright, instead of just watching the film,\nwe will be surrounded by the film.\nMilton. L. Gunzberg has been developing a method of projecting \u20183D\u2019\nimages called \u2018Natural Colour\u2019 and\nhas started to demonstrate it to all\nthe major studios but with little suc-cess. MGM showed some interest and\neven optioned the process, however\nthey seem to have forgotten about it\nsince and are now concentrating on\nthe usual lavish musicals instead. Mr.\nGunzberg stated \u201cLouis B. Mayer is\nblind, audiences are turning away from\ncinemas in their millions to sit in front\nof their new \u2018televisions\u2019 and he thinks\nthat turning out more and more ridiculously expensive musicals is going\nto bring them back! Natural Colour is\nthe future of cinema, we will bide our\ntime but in ten years time all films will\nbe three dimensional and in sixty years\ntime technology will have advanced so\nmuch that the pictures will be beamed\nstraight to our brains!\u201d\nWe will have to wait and see about\nthe latter point Milton but rumour\nhas it that the maverick director, Arch\nOboler, is condisering this new medium for his next film: \u2018A savage and\nfantastical adventure through the mysterious lands of the African Savannah!\u2019.\n(As decided by Ed Knock who spent hours on Photoshop making this rather excellent timeline!)\nThe new 3D spectacular!\nEdKnock Film Editor\nAw...Katie couldn\u2019t sleep.\n\n"

The unit in\nquestion was in fact the Barn. The bonuses of St Hugh\u2019s included Latin expressions in Art, Natural Dyes and Mythology. Of the Oxford team, an excited\nBrown was prompted to \u2018\u2019calm down!\u2019\u2019\nby Paxman for answering enthusiastically such that she interrupted the voiceover announcing her name.\nOnce the final gong sounded, Paxman lightly mocked St Hugh\u2019s for their\nslow start and joked that they had been\n\u201cslaughtered\u201d. The Imperial team was\npraised by Paxman for their knowledge\nin travel literature, philosophy and football in the first round despite being science specialists. Both the Imperial team\nand St Hugh\u2019s were of the youngest\nteams in the competition with an average age of 19.\nFuture episodes are to be broadcast\nin Da Vinci\u2019s by the union to encourage\nthe supportive environment of students\nand the economic benefits which follow\nfrom such quantities of people in a bar.\nThe second round will be over when the\nUniversity of Manchester plays Strand\nPolytechnic-I mean King\u2019s College London on December 21st, after which the\nquarter finals follow. Imperial has previously won in 1996 and 2001, coming\nsecond in 2002, and we wish the best of\nluck to them this year! \u201cYes, blad. You iz well thick. We just shat all ovaa you, bruv.
