This is so a list of property\nowned by a club or society can be assessed\nfor insurance purposes. I do urge those\nconcerned to return the form as soon as\npossible.

    "content": "Sirs,\nAs Frank James deems it fit to\nname IC Rugby as one of the\n\"most notable offenders\" in his\nattack against \"anti-intellectualism\", I feel the record must be\nput straight.\nAlthough I find his expressed\nviews on the CCUs debatable (to\nput it mildly) I will only concern\nmyself with the Rugby Club.\nIC Rugby Club have never held\ninitiation ceremonies of any form\nfor its members and never will do.\nThis Mr. James is FACT - perhaps\nyou should check up?\nWe are a sporting club and as\nsuch exist solely to play rugby. We\nhave no desire to \"degrade\"\npeople or be a \"creeping disease\"\nthroughout the CCUs. Our club is\npart of IC Union, not the CCUs by\nthe way.\nThe members of IC Rugby play\ntwice each week and train twice\neach week - all because they\nWANT to play rugby for IC - not\nbecause they wish to become a \"beer-swilling lout\" or a \"latent\nhomosexual\".\nHeaven knows why our club\nshould be labelled as \"detrimental\nto the life of individual students\nwithin the college\".\nYou will notice that I have\nincluded several quotes from Mr.\nJames' letter: reading them will\nmake you realize just how\nridiculous his comments were.\nSteve Townsend\nCaptain IC Rugby Club\nPS - I won't be sending the boys\nround to \"clone\" you into our\nway of thinking Mr. James. (Anti-intellectualism?)\nDear Sir,\nThe Freshers have now been at\nCollege for about a fortnight and\nhave probably formed their own\nopinions about the College, the\nUnion and specifically the CCUs.\nMany events have been\norganized in the first week, almost\nall of them by the CCUs (and the\nRugby Club). These events have\nbeen well attended and generally\nwell liked.\nThe Constituent College Unions\nare democratic organizations,\nanyone can propose motions\nand/or put fore ward new ideas at\ntheir meetings, most of which are\nopen to all students. This seems to\nus to indicate a willingness to help\nand be helped and to participate\nwith the fresher s and everyone\nelse; it does not seem, to us at\nleast, that we are trying to cast\nimpressionable young people in a 'wicked mould.'.\n'Once in aCC U all chance of\ndoing something else is\nimmediately denied.' What\nrubbish! You are free to come and\ngo, as and when yo like. The way\nFJ goes on, one would think that\nwe strapped fresher s down in the\nC CU Offices, gave them a quick\nfrontal Ipbotomy and force fed\nthem beer! On the contrary,\nelected in fair and free elections,\nwe as Presidents take it upon\nourselves to involve people in\nCollege life and if the CCUs can't cater tor a particular interest, we\nare the first to suggest who can.\nFrank James states that anyone\ntaking an interest in academic\nwork is shunned by the CCUs.\nWhy then do RCSU, C& GU and\nR SMU organize their own\nAcademic Affairs Committees,\nand elect Academic Reps and\nOfficers who discuss problems\nwith the staff and other students?\nAre we to assume that Prof.\nLaithwaite etc are beer-swilling\nlouts with latent homosexual\ntendencies, just because they\ntake part in the academic clubs\nwhich are part of a CCU?\nAnother important part of a CCU,\nis Rag, which undoubtedly\nencourages individuality because\nof the constant need for new ideas\nnecessary to maintain a year long\neffort which collects thousands of\npounds for charity.\nFrank James seems to have no\ncompunction about slamming the\nCCUs, which get out there and\nraise money for worthwhile\ncauses, perhaps he thinks it more\nworthwhile to sit around\ncomposing misleading letters.\nHere we are speaking for the\nfeeling in our colleges and sign off\naccordingly, does Frank James'\nletter present the views of the\nSocial Clubs Committee? Come on Frank, you've missed\nthe point, you rabbit on about\ndistraction from observance of\nsections of the Union and then\npick on one facet of the CCUs,\ncompletely ignoring the valuable\nwork done by them in all other\nspheres.\nYours concerned ly, Sean O 'Boyle (President RCSU)\nJo Armitage (President C& GU)\nBernie Pryor (Acting President\nRSMU)\nDear Sir,\nAs a postgraduate 'fresher1, with\nexperience of how other student\nbodies are run, may I say that I am\nin total agreement with Frank\nJames' letter in FELIX (no. 527). I first encountered this incredible\nstate of affairs when I went to the\ninaugural C&G union meeting in\nmy first week.\nI was amazed how a group of\npeople of supposed above\naverage intelligence could behave\nlike absolute idiots. The events of\nthe meeting included holding a coin in your crutch (having\npreviously pretended to stick it up\nyour asshole) and waddling down\nsome steps to drop it in a paper\ncup. Was this practice really worth\ntaking up even a few minutes of a normal humans life? The whole\nprocess was ended in everyone\nbeing instructed to chant some\nmainly unintelligible nursery\nrhyme.\nAre these the events which\ncontribute to the social development of students? Can\nyou therefore wonder at the\npublic' s attitude towards\nstudents? Most of the students at\nthe meeting were fresher s.I am\nsure they are not all morons. But\nfrom this meeting they were given\nthe impression from their 'peers',\nthat this is the way to behave. I am\nsure lost s of IC students would\nlike to get involved in more\nimportant matters. The CCUs\nshould be a meeting place for\ndebate and a centre for organizing\naction. The gulf between the\nCCUs and the student movement\nis shown by the fact that IC\nsponsored a South African\nstudent and a RSM team plays\nrugby against white South\nAfricans!\nWhy don't we give Intelligent,\nresponsible and socially aware\nbehaviour a chance and make the\nCCUs an agent for student\nexpression and not public\nschoolboy pranks.\nYours faithfully,\nMichael O 'Connor\nPG Social and Economic Studies\nDear Colin,\nThe two replies which were\npublished in the last FELIX in\nresponse to my letter containing\nvarious criticisms of the CCUs\n(FELIX 527) made remarkably\ninteresting reading. Indeed I found them so interesting that I think they go a long way towards\nproving my contention that the\nCCUs are highly undesirable\ninstitutions.\nThe anonymous letter suggesting that serious consideration\nshould be given to my own\nabolition is typical of the CCUs\nreaction to anything with which\nthey disagree. That is a totally\nunreasoning statement designed\nto enforce conformity, but which\nactually demonstrates how utterly\npathetic these C CU people are.\nThe other letter, by James Gray,\nwonderfully illustrates how non-intellectual the CCUs are - he\ncan't even read! Mr. Gray not only\nascribes to me views which I did\nnot include in my letter, but also\nsome which I do not even hold.\nFor example, he says, that I believe that the CCUs ought to be\n'nationalized' into ICU. He\ncontinued by suggesting that I would not be satisfied with that,\nbut would like to see one all-embracing national students\nunion. Apart from the fact I never\nsaid anything like this, I do not\nhold these particular views. All I suggested was that since the\nCCUs appear to be in contravention of our by-laws serious\nconsideration should be given to\ntheir abolition.\nHowever, despite his inability to\nread my letter and his consequent\nfailure to answer my points, I will\nendeavour to answer the points\nwhich he raised in his letter.\nHe suggested that the smoking\nconcerts are 'in moderation,\nessential to the academic and\nsocial development of the\nstudent'. The trouble is they are\nnot held in moderation; it has\nbecome increasingly apparent\nthis year that any suggestions of\nmoderation are simply rejected by\nthe CCUs though they attempt to\nemploy methods of concealment\nand dis-information to hide their\ncontempt for those people who\nhave suggested moderation\nIn the case of sporting standards\nand academic affairs, Mr. Gray\nraises valid points. But it should\nnot be beyond the wit of man to\ndevise ways of retaining the\npresent status which these fields\nenjoy at the same time do away\nwith those degrading aspects of\nthe CC Us which I have\nhighlighted. Indeed I would\nsuggest that by such action more\nattention could be focused on\nsporting standards and academic\naffairs.\nFinally, I should like to answer\nMr. Gray's suggestion that\nreforms of the CCUs should come\nfrom within rather than without. I thus return to my analysis of the\ntribal structure of the CCUs. By\nenforcing certain taboos by the\ndeg red ation which the CCUs\nimposes on its members, they\nensure that no serious innovation\nwill take place within the CCUs.\nSince to suggest such a thing\nwould be to break the tribal taboo\nand incur whatever wroth the\nCCUs can inflict. Thus it is\nimpossible for reform to come\nfrom within; it must be from\nwithout.\nYours sincerely,\nFrank James\nPS\nI presume that no letters from the\npresidents of the CCUs imply\nthey are too afraid to have their\nviews published in FELIX.\nMORE LETTERS\nON\nPAGE\nFOUR\n2\n\n"

Lord\nCarrington gave the rival delegations until\nMonday to accept his proposals for the\ncountry's independance. He rejected the\nFront Leaders' objections, but to push the\nFront could jeopardize the British peace\nplans. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^\nThe engineers' strike, which has cost an\nestimated billions of pounds in lost\nproduction, could be over soon. Employers\ngave a broad hint at a secret meeting with\nUnion leaders about increasing the pay offer.\nThe talks have save the Confederation of\nEngineering Unions from an embarrassing\npublic split. _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nRolls Royce, who laid off 30,000 workers\nbecause of strikes have missed out on a \u00a360million order from All Nipon Airways, who\ndecided in favour of Boeing jets with\nAmerican engines.\nMr James Callaghan lost by a slender\n848,000 votes his power to determine the\nparty's election manifesto. Mr Callaghan\nalready had several shocks: claims that his\ndefeat would bring election victories and\nprotest on not including the promise to axe\nthe House of Lords in the last manifesto. He\nwas, however, defended by various people,\nsaying that the NEC was unfit to draw the\nmanifesto and that the voters do not want\nextreme left wing socialism.\nTHURSDAY 4th Engineering Unions have won a reduction\nof one hour in the working week from the end\nof 1981, and an extra holiday week\nEmployers said that it could lead to industrial\npeace for four years, as Unions called for an\nimmediate end to strikes, which have cost\nfirms \u00a32,000million in lost sales Mr Callaghan made it clear, that he has no\nintention of giving way to the fundamental\nquestion of ultimate authority over party\npolicy. This week's decision at the Brighton\nConference, he conceded, amounted to a censure of his premiership. But, he said that it\nwas still the parliamentary labour party which\nretained fundamental responsibility for\naction of labour governments\nCambodia refuted claims by the International Committee of Red Cross and\nUNICEF that it authorized the two\ninternational relief organizations to open\noffices in Phenom Penh or agreed to a large\nscale aid operation for the famine-stricken\ncountry.\nThe US is sell ling grain to USSR and may\nsell arms to China in a complex balancing act.\nFRIDAY 5th A tough package of anti-IRA border\nse curt iy measures was agreed between\nBritish and Eire ministers. The measures\ninvolve far closer cooperation between the\nRUC and the Irish police and more intensive\npatrolling of the perilous area on both sides of\nthe border.\nBishop Muzorewa formally accepted\nBritish proposals for the Rhodesian\nconstitution and to take part in new elections\nunder British supervision. The Bishop said\nthe agreement was subject to 'suitable and\nsatisfactory' arrangements for bringing the\nconstitution into effect and the lifting of\nsanctions. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nThe Government is unwilling to pour extra\ntax payers' money into British Leyiand. Sir\nKeith Joseph, Industry Secretary, said he\nwould take 'some convincing' of the need for\nextra money and that the Leyiand board and\nthe National Enterprise board must provide\nevidence is support of any further funds\nbeing given to British Ley i and. SATURDAY 6th USSR will withdraw up to 20.000troops and\n1,000 tanks from East Germany in the next\nyear. This surprising move is hoped by the\nRussians to ease the path to detente, but\nsceptical Western observers say that the\ncatch is that Brezhnev demands NATO\nshould not increase its own nuclear forces.\nThis could be said to alter the situation in\nEurope radically and force Warsaw Pact\nnations to take steps to strengthen its own\nsecurity.\nMr Merlyn Rees, warned that the Labour\nParty was threatened with extinction. There\nare growing doubts by others on the right of\nthe Parliamentary Labour Party over the\neffectiveness of Mr Callagnan's leadership.\nThey argue that since he was out\nmanoeuvre d by the left and if the erosion of\nthe leader's authority continues, the left will\ndominate the inquiry into the party. Mr\nCallaghan, however, will carry on as he has\nthe backing of the majority of the shadow\ncabinet. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nPope John Paul visited the White House\nand joined Mr Carter in calling for nuclear\ndisarmament and agreed with the President,\nthat more international support is needed for\nthe relief of the Third World, starving people\nand refugees. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^\nLord Carrington described acceptance of\nthe British draft constitution by Bishop\nMuzorewa as a major step forward. The\nPatriotic Front Leaders refuse to accept the\nBritish proposals as they are deeply\nsuspicious of a secret deal with Bishop\nMuzorewa and that he is relying on the front\nline nations to put pressure on them.\nLeaders of the black consciousness\nmovement in South Africa are about to put\nthe South African Governments reform i ost zeal to the test Mr Bott, a South African\npremier, might have to rely on the English\nspeaking section of the electorate to back\nhis onslaught of the outdated and crude\nracial laws in existence\nSUNDAY 7th Mr Smith made his position as leader ofthe\nwhite minority clear, by threatening to use his\npolitical strength to prevent parliamentary\napproval of the constitution proposed by\nBritian and in doing so he acknowledged his\nalienation from the rest of the Salisbury\ngovernment delegation. South Africa has\noffered to mediate between the Bishop and\nMr Smith.The government yesterday hinted that it\nmio ht order a public inquiry into the death of\nBlair Peach. Mr Peach died after being struck\nduring the Southall race riots and insufficient\nevidence has come to light during the inquest\ninto his death.\nMONDAY 8th The Rhodesia conference reached a critical stage last night after the Patriotic\nFront rejected British constitutional plans\nand advanced their own draft. In their\ndemands the Front leaders called for the\nnegotiations to move onto the second stage:\npre independence arrangements of a transitional period and their reservations\nabout the British draft being noted.\nMeanwhile white MPs in Rhodesia gave their\nunanimous support to the strategy being\npursued by Mr Smith to prevent removal of\nwhite privilege.\nA soldier in civilian clothes was killed and\nanother injured in a terrorist ambush in West\nBelfast, when their mini was attacked by\nautomatic fire by three men from a hardware\nshop off the Falls Road.\nIn an unprecedented speech at a private\nluncheon to members of the Newspaper\nSociety, Mr Mason (former minister for\nNorthern Ireland) spoke of the pressure on\nhim and his family by holding the office. The\npost was described as 'awesome and\ngruelling' and he said that the IRA's powerful\npropaganda machine was skilfully using the\nBritish press to undermine British policy and\nsmall all faith in democratic institutions.\nTUESDAY 9th Lord Carrington told the Patriotic Front\nleaders to give him their 'definitive reply' on\nthe final draft of the Zimbabwean constitution\nwhen he returns to Lancaster House from the\nConservative Party conference. Mr Mugabe\nreiterated that some parts of ;the British draft\nconstitution are unacceptable and that the\nFront are prepared to step up the guerilla war\nrather than surrender on points of principle,\nas they believe intensification of the struggle\nwill eventually lead to victory, but a settlement at Lancaster House would be\nwelcome. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nThe Defence Secretary, Mr Pym, said that\nthe Russian offer of troop withdrawal should\nbe seen in the proper perspective. Even these\nreductions would leave the Warsaw Pact\nforces with 140,000 more men and 9,500\ntanks than NATO. He was speaking at the\nConservative Party conference and went on\nto reaffirm the present government's commitment to nuclear weapons and\nmaintaining an effective nuclear deterrent.\nThe Irish government was found guilty by\nthe Human Rights Court of two breaches of\nthe European Convention of Human Rights\nbecause it failed to provide civil legal aid orto\nsimplify its family courts systems.

    "content": "Thus were the first few chaotic days of University life for Anne, Robin\nand their friends. Before then, their lives had been virtual y dominated by\ntheir parents whose attitudes, convictions and prejudices were either\nsomething to be despised or applauded, the more sensible approach is\nto use them as a plumb-line in formulating a philo so sph y of life of their\nown. For the auto-did act Robin, he had to beware of turning into that\nstrange breed of man, the confirmed academic, the man who lives his\nlife in an ivory tower, high above the whirligig of life, never tasting fw f or\nbliss.\nBeing a girl, Anne's problems were of a different nature. Having learnt\nto live with her womanhood, she had to learn to be a woman. What often\nhappens to girls like Anne in a University environment, is that they use\nacademia as a veil for their femininity, which tends to become\nneglected. This danger is all the more real at a place like I.e., where only\nthe Sciences are taught. It is quite possible that Anne will, at some time\nor another, experience some difficulty in reconciling her twin roles of\nscientist and woman. 'Welcome to your first identity crisis', the poster\nhad said.\nIn general, the scientist is a peculiar fellow; sometimes exceptionally\npractical and pragmatic, at others, he can fall foul of the scientists'\npreferred pastime....excessive theorising. But the purpose of a course at\nany educational institution is two-fold: fist, to train the mind to think\nrationally, and second, to condition the student to conform to the status\nquo. Id are say some will hotly dispute these conclusions, be that as it\nmay. Some men think these a is green, others call it blue.\nWhatever happens, Anne and robin will never forget their Universtiy\ndays, and during the three year vigil, will forge many life-long\nfriendships.\nJustin Newland\nOVERSEAS\nSTUDENTS\nCOMMITTEE There was a meeting of the presidents of various\nOS C and social societies on the 5 th Oct. The following points arose: -a) Will the following societies who have not\ninformed Jen ofthe names ofthe members of their\ncommittees please do so as soon as possible, the\nsocieties are; Latin American, Arab, Iranian,\nBangledesh, Afro Caribbean and Pakistan.\nb) Since the various national societies are\naffiliated to OS C, will they please inform us when\nthey hold a meeting and also attend the OS C meeting when invited or at least send a reasonable\nexcuse for not doing so.\nc) Will the societies remove their mail from the\nUnion Office and check at least once a fortnight, as\notherwise the mail will go into the bin. This is the\nlast warning.\nPlease pay attention to the points above, as it will\nmake life a lot easier.\nBetween Friday, 14th September and Tuesday,\n2 nd October, about 220 overseas fresher s used the\nreception desk facilities run by the College and Union OS Cs. Since the beginning ofthe term, quite a lot has\nhappened. There have been receptions by the ICC U,I CUO SC, Indian and Chinese Societies. It\nwas nice to see home students take part in these, but\nwe need a lot more help. There will be an informal\ndiscussion every Monday, in the S CR from 6:30.\nEverybody is invited, as we need help in getting\noverseas students settled down. Tea and biscuits\nare provided.\nThe College OS C held its reception for PG s on\nTuesday, 2 nd October. This was attended by the\nrector, Lord Flowers and his wife Lady Flowers,\nMr Dixon( chairman of ICO SC), Mr Robertson\n(welfare advisor and secretary of ICO SC), members of OS C and various people providing\nwelfare and social services for students. The rector, in his address to the students, said\nthat he wanted overseas students to be an indistinguishable part ofthe college and that they\nwere an asset to the college, academically and culturally. He expressed disagreement with quota\nsystem and fee increases. He also hoped that while,,,\nthey were in the UK, they could learn about\nEngland, the English and their sense of fair play.\nMr Dixon, expressed similar hopes and said that\noverseas students were held in high regard and had a committee of their own. He and Mr Robertson\nthen introduced the students to various services\nprovided by the College and Union. They were obviously very sincere speeches, by\nvery helpful and hard-working people. I think,\nhowever, that they were a trifle unrealistic. I do not\nbelieve that overseas students can become an indistinguishable part of this or any college yet.\nQuite apart from the fact that there are language\nproblems and problems of adapting to a different\nculture, there is the quota system and fee\ndifferentials. This government is also considering\nraising fees to the mythical 'full economic cost'.\nThe language problem can be solved and. the\ncultural exchange is mutually beneficial, but fees\nare another matter. If the fees are raised to the\n'full economic cost' (approx ^2,300), the number of\nstudents will be limited to the very wealthy, but in\nthe end, it will be the British people who will be the\nlosers. Overseas studen ts at this college give\nfascinating insights into their different cu lures, they do a lot of the academic research (50% of PG s are overseas students) and eventually when they go\nback to their countries, they are more likely to\norder British goods, as they are used to them and know the various ranges and services provided.\nAccording to the London conference on overseas\nstudents, in association with UK COSA and NUS, overseas students are subsidizing the economy to\nthe tune of ^50million a year. The conference takes\nas its starting point, marginal rather than gross\ncosts, assuming that the education is for home\nstudents, it calculates the extra costs to cope with\noverseas students, Mr Robertson said in ef le cl that\ntheir contribution was substantial and valuable\nand in fact some projects in some depart merits\nwould be hard, if not impossible, to manage\nwithout them and of course these students bring\nnot only working time and energy, but ideas.\nI believe that overseas students are an important\npart of College life and t fiat only by working\ntogether and learning about each other will we Inable to solve the problems faring us.\nAs the first U GM this year, Mr Fox, ICU President asked for support against fee iri< re aes. There will fx' a picket ofthe DK S Office on Friday,\n12th October. Please give your support.\nA. GUJRAL I CUO SC Chairman FILM REVIEW\nLORD OF THE\nRINGS\n\"This tale grew in the telling....\", so begins\nTolkiens fore ward to his best selling and\nhighly-praised classic, \"The Lord of the\nRings\". That was a trilogy, with the Hobbit, a later-written prequel. This film \"tells\" the\nstory of the first book and a half, with a brief\nsummary of the Hobbit, and a second and\nfinal film is due out next year.\nNow, I say \"tells\" with reservations, as a book of such proportions (over 900 pages) is\ndifficult to transpose to two, two and a half\nhour films; but what the film lacks in detail,\nit makes up for in animation, particularly\nwith the use of a new technique, by which\nlive-action is filmed and turned into a cartoon, (excellent for the fast-moving\nbattles).\nHowever, the true Tolkienophile will find\nmany flaws or differences with his/her\nimpressions of the characters and events.\nFor instance: is Gimli the dwarf, really only\nsix inches shorter than tall, proud Aragorn;\ndoes Galadriel, the beautiful elf en queen, so\nclosely resemble a menopausal street-walker; and why does Treebeard the Ent's rear look like that of a bulldog.\nThe hobbits too, are rather akin to human\nchildren, but the accents, especially lovable\ngardener Sam's West Country burr, are I \u2022\nthink, excellent. So too is the Jewish accent\ngiven to Gollum, an unfortunate early victim\nof the evil ring. (Imagine, if you can, Dickens'\nFagin saying, \"We hate Bagginses, my\nPrecious!\").\nNor will any mention of Tom Bombardil or\nAragorn's betrothed, Arwen Evenster be\nheard, considerably pruning the events of\nthe first book.\nIt would be a waste to pre c is the story, as\nthe film already does, suffice it to say, it is a quest to destroy a pretty powerful ring,\nbefore its evil maker regains it.\nTo conclude, if you've already read the\nbook, this film fails somewhat on certain\nlevels, but is still technically very impressive\nand if you haven't, then it'll be great fun.\nPETER HEWKIN\nPS\nSee it at your local cinema, its j \u00a32.50 in the\nWest End.\n18\n\n"

    "content": "By now, both of them had been formally introduced to the favorite\npastime of all students at the beginning of any academic\nyear....queueing. They queued to register; they'd queued for lunch;\nthey'd queued for their grant cheques (miraculously, both of theirs had\narrived intact and in full); they'd queued to join queues. At one stage,\nRobin joined a queue simply because he'd begun to think it was a genuinely edifying'experience. Anne certainly had some painful waits:\nshe'd had to queue for twenty minutes just to answer the call of nature.\nRichard, one of Robin's new friends, nad reluctantly joined those\nunfortunate few whose grant cheques fail to arrive on time. But here a bit of I.C. tradition may be useful to him. If you find yourself in a similar\nposition, and happen to be in the Union Bar (when it' open) you may\nbecome an unwitting victim of a nefarious group who've christened\nthemselves the 'Below the Handle' brigade. These philanthropic\ngentleman, if they catch you holding a pint whose level of beer has\ndropped 'below the handle' they will instantly dispossess you of your\nglass, and before you can utter the first expletive which comes to your\nlips, your glass will be promptly returned, full to the brim with the best\nEnglish ale!\nNow it' time to return to our hero and heroine, who are at this moment\nsav our ing the myriad delights proffered by the Fresher's Fair. This is\none of many opportunities in the year when you can witness what can\nonly be described as 'organised chaos'! As each ofthe hundred or so\nCollege societies clam our for your custom, you may begin to wonder\njust which one(s) to join.\nRobin did join the War Games Club, for his secret ambition was to\nemulate a certain Corsican who'd taken Europe by storm in the late\nEighteenth and early Nineteenth Centuries.\nAnne joined Graffiti, a group who do not advocate that you waste your\ncreative energy defacing urinal walls, but rather that you make use of\nthem by learning to s cree m print. Samaritan that she is, Anne also\noffered her talents to Night-line, a volunteer organisation who answer\nstudent S.O.S. calls at any time of the night or day.\nNow Richard, who was, for your information, a Post-graduate, was\none of those fellows who have developed a huge appetite for anything\neven distantly related to the hop or grape family. As a result, he forced\nhimself to join the Wine-tasting Society. As a post-graduate (i.e. one of\nthose students who never stop telling you how they've been through it\nall before) Richard automatically qualified to become a member of the\nPostgrad group. Alas, the leaflet they sent him early in the term got\nmislaid somewhere in the la brin th s of the internal mail system, so he\nonly discovered the existence ofthe group when the letter finally turned\nup in his pigeon hole just after Christmas. Robin had already\nexperienced some of the diabolical whims of the system: he would\nfrequently find letters addressed to him (his surname was Bignall) either\nin the 'A' or the ' C compartments.\nThat same evening there was a choice of entertainments, as there\nusually is on every night of the first week or term. There's often a film\nshow or perhaps a band playing somewhere in the college. If your idea\nof vice does not consist of listening to some aspiring Tony Blackburn or\ngetting drunk in the Union Bar again, k then you could always follow\nRichard. The night before he'd gone over to the Collegiate Theatre in\nGordon Square to sample the delights of a musical evening care ofthe\nUniversity College. He is always extolling the virtues of the London\nnight-life, which, he adds, can cater for any vice or perversity you care to mention. Indeed, Richard has some strong views on most things: HE\nbelieves that students have less rights than illegal immigrants: that it is a travesty of justice to expect students to live on a sum of money that's not\nenough to feed a peasant in Bangla Desh: and that it is preposterous\nthat every man you meet in the street thinks that the taxes he pays are\nall spent on keeping YOU in education.\nBut that night, somehow he managed to drag Robin along to a folk\nevening. Early on, the accumulated effect of flashing neon lights, an\nat most p here suffused with the fumes of intemperance, and a cacophony loud enough to wake the dead, forced our hero to excuse\nhimself. He had migraine, and was in grave danger of contracting a long\nlist of un pronoun cable ailments, or so he thought. Anne, who was there with City and Guilds', prolonged her carousal to\nfifty-four hours. She had never drunk so much for so long for such effect\nin all her seventeen years. This first week is indeed the time when\nsizeable portions of one's grant disappear down the throat, only to be\nexpelled again at a later date.\nAs the night draws on, the conversations at these binges tend to lack\nrefinement....in fact, it degrades into downright vulgarity, which is\nthought by all adolescents to be equivalent to man-talk.\nThese first few days that our hero persons were away from the\nprotection of their family were a kind of mirror of their new-found\nindependence. They were both compelled to make decisions, both\nsocial and moral, that they had never had to make before. As a result,\nareas of their personality, previously dormant, now made themselves\napparent. This is probably one of the main reasons why adolescence is\nsuch a confusing time, for their decisions and actions have no\nprecedent, they have to be worked out from scratch. In this way, both\nAnne and Robin would learn about themselves, their moral code, their\nsocial awareness, and their political views.\n(continued on next page)\nLondon Student Travel\nissue British Rail Student Railcards\nfrom their office in the Union Lower Lounge on production of documentary proof that the intending\npurchaser is a student, eg-a valid\nunion card, a valid XLS card, a registration slip or a form with two signed and stamped photographs.\nFOR SALE SUZUKI GS400,5,000 miles, good\ncondition, two years old, \u00a3525 ono\ncontact G.

I refer of course to attempts to\ndissuade people from banking\nwith Barclays, working for South\nAfrican companies and playing\nsports against South African\nteams.\nIt is time that ICU realizes that\nthere are people who are capable\nof independant thought which\nmay well differ from that of ICU. If\nICU does not do this then it had\nbetter give up talking of freedom,\nbecause at the moment it would\nappear that ICU's idea is that you\nare only entitled to freedom if you\nare black and foreign.\nYours faithfully,\nRJ GLASS\nMech Eng 2\n\n"

Why go to the Anglesea at all? The reason must certainly be the REAL ALE. There has been a pub on the site ofthe Anglesea\never since the area was developed in the eighteenth\ncentury, and since then has passed through many changes. The most recent major change,\nconsidered by some to be vandalism resulted in the\nVictorian bars (there were three) and screens being\nremoved and the building of the two bars present\nnow. The larger bar serves drinks, while the other\nserves food at iu nch time. The pub has been a free\nhouse for a relatively short time; it was previously a Ben Truman tied house. At that ime it was one of\nthe first pubs to introduce draught Guinness.\nNow to the most important part of any pub, the\nbeer. The Anglesea offers a selection of six real ales;\nWadworths 6 X, Sam Smiths Old Brewery Bitter,\nRuddles County, Brakespears Best, Youngs Best\nand Everards Tiger. During the winter a' Winter Ale' is introduced. This year it is likely to be\nYoungs Winter Warmer. The ales are usually in\ngood condition, but occasionally an 'off pint' may occur. This is normally, the result of a barrel\ncoming to an end. All ofthe ales are served from a rare set of six antique hand pumps. The most difficult part of drinking in the\nAnglesea prices have not increased recently (apart\nif you are not used to drinking real ale.\nUnfortunately there are no 'ordinary' bitters to be\nhad, and those served tend to be strong in both\nalcohol content and taste. The Rudd les and Wadworths are perhaps the strongest and also tend\nto be the sweetest. The Brakespears Special is a good bet if the decision is impossible, as it tends to\nbe constant in its taste; sweet but not too sweet. The Sams is am atty pint tending to be a bit 'thick', the\nYoungs is comparable to Brakespears, and the\nTiger is perhaps the most bitter. Food is only served at lunch time, the selection\noffered is typical of many pubs. The quality ofthe\nfood is good, especially the quiche and chilli\ncon carne. With the plough mans, you can have a piece of cheese; either cheddar, camembert of blue\nstilton.\nThe pub attracts large numbers of people,\nespecially since it is in the Cam ra 'good beer guide'\nand many tourist books. The pub has thus two\ncharacters, one a 'local' and the other being an attraction for real ale seekers. The former are\nprevalent during the lunchtime session and the\nlatter after about 7:30 in the evening. To my mind, the pub is a better place during the morning. The pub is easy to find from college, it is a ten\nminute walk down Queens Gate, straight across\nthe Old Brompton Road into Onslow Gardens. It is\nabout two hundred metres on the right from Old Brompton Road. Take my advice and give the pub\na visit, \" And in thy joyous Errand reach the Spot,\nwhere I made one-turn down an empty glass!\"\nThe Anglesea Arms,15 Selwood Terrace\nOpening hours:-Mon Fri1 l:00am3:00p m,5:30 pml1:00 pmS at1 l:00am3:00p m,6:30 pml1:00 pm Sun12:002:00 pm,7:00 pm10:30 pm Nick Gratfon\n\n"

    "content": "RUGBY\nWhile FELIX were covering last\nSunday's Rugby match, the Assistant\nSecretary of the Metropolitan Police\nClub came over and said that the match\nshould be stopped. We now print the\ntranscript of the conversation between\nthe FELIX reporter and the Assistant\nSecretary:\nFELIX The games got to be stopped?\nA.S. Yeah -according to my governor.\nWhy they didn't tell us the truth I 'll never\nknow. Being a police club we can't afford to get involved in bloody politics.\nIf it hadn't been for some fucking\nloud mouthed fucking reporter, that was\nhere, it would be near enough all right.\nFELIX: THE MIRROR?\nA.S. Yeah opening his mouth in the bar.\nMy Governor wants it stopped unless\nsomeone can come and convince him\nthat it shouldn't be. He's over in the club\nhouse. Me - I'm all for sport because I organise the sport here. Quite honestly,\nwe would never have known if it wasn't for the man from the Daily Papers.\nI'm all for it. I would let anybody play.\nAs I say - if the blok e comes over and\nputs it in the national press - then our\ngovernors will be on our neck - we're\nonly poor policemen and we run the club\nfor the whole of the Metropolitan Police\nand I say as much as I'd like the game to\ngo on - and I dare say so would he - we\njust can't afford to get involved in it.\n.... You booked it as the School of Mines\nverses the Mining industry. Now I used\nto work in the pit and I know what it is all\nabout. I was down there for 11 years. I'd like it to go on because I'd like to come\nand watch it. I'm only the understudy\nand I 've got to do as I'm told.\nThe match was consequently called\noff at half time with the score 22 - 4 to the\nSouth African team. The South Africans\nliked the hard fast ground because they\nare used to bone dry conditions. Ray\nParkinson was the scorer of the select\nteams only try.\nCentral Stores\nCentral Stores require twelve student\nhelpers for two or three hours on\nWednesday afternoon, 17th October. \u00a32\nper hour.

This was a game\nbetween the B2s, whose line up included\nthe ICU President, and a team from the\nDecca Record Company. The B2s\nused South African players to make up\ntheir numbers. Chris apparently did not\nrealise that the South Africans were\ntaking part until the game was in\nprogress and said that had he known\nthey were playing; he would have\ncarefully considered his participation in\nthe match.\nRAG MAG WARNING\nYesterday, College Solicitors warned\nthe Union that the Rag Mag was illegal.\nThe President, Chris Fox, took\nimmediate action and seized all copies\nfrom the Union offices.

    "content": "MODERN PHYSICS\nAND THE IRRATIONAL\nby our Science Correspondent\nThe tube station walks to my house every\nmorning, i buy a ticket, get in the train and the\nearth sets off. Usually I do not take any notice\nof the train's destination, so I ask the\npassenger\" sitting next to me, 'Excuse me,\ndoes South Kensington Station stop at this\ntrain?' 'I beg your pardon?!'\nI apologize for having been carried away by\nrelativity, but ever since I received my formal\nmodern physics training at IC, those exotic\nprinciples, weird theories and subtle\nparadoxes of modern physics (relativity,\nuncertainty, antimatter, black holes, big bang,\nquarks etc.) have really muddled and\ntroubled me.\nTry to imagine the plight of the physics\nstudent. He is taught at school (and I am\nquoting from a text-book) that 'the earth is\nour frame of reference, ie it is treated as\nabsolutely stationary (fixed) and all motion is\nobserved relative to it.' I would have thought\nthat this is pretty obvious, for the huge earth\ncarrieS j in physical phenomena, an\nimmensely greater weight and gravity than,\nsay, the mere speeding train. But when I came\nto IC I realized that fashions change in\nscience too - just as in millinery; I was\nlectured about Einstein's celebrated train-embankment Ged an ken experiment\naccording to which one is allowed to describe\nthe hard facts of life in the extraordinary way I ventured to introduce above.\nThe unfortunate physics student is taught\nrelativity and he is also taught quantum\nmechanics. However, rarely is it pointed out\nto him that the basic philosophy, concepts\nand mathematics which underlie these two\ngrand systems are mutually exclusive and\noften contradictory. Taking into account the\nfact that gravitation and electromagnetism -two less mutually exclusive systems - have\ndefied unification for so long, even despite\nthe lifelong efforts of no less a scientific giant\nthan Einstein, one wonders how the former\ntwo theories are ever going to be reconciled.\nI have come across text-books of\nelectromagnetism and treatises of optics\nwhich develop their respective theories on\nthe basis of an 'ether* - light-medium - but\ntowards the end (typically page 600 or so)\nthey deliver a shocking blow to the poor\nstudent by stating explicitly and\nunashamedly that 'the simpler view seems to\nbe that there is no ether'; I would say that the\nsimplest view is k that there is no text-book.\nIt is not surprising then, but seen from\nanother angle it is extremely disturbing,that-a famous contemporary philosopher of\nscience, Professor P. Feyerabend, has\ndeclared that 'under all circumstances and in\nall stages of human development (science, of\ncourse, included j any fh/ ng goes.' Right you\nguys, have a go with your own brilliant\nideas....\nNor is it surprising that there is a great deal\nof talk about revolution in science: in a time of\nsuch upheaval, the unfortunate scientist has\nto suffer the embarrassment and humiliation\nof abandoning long cherished views and\ntheories in favour of more modern and, as a rule, more esoteric and more abstruse. In\naddition to this, a fantastic amount of work\nalong the lines of the discredited viewpoint is\nsimply thrown into the dustbin. The Dance of Shiva pictured by twelfth-century\nEastern artists and twentieth-century physicists\nEver since my first days at IC I have always\nfelt uneasy with modern physics and its\nmethods. I could detect in them, (from quite\nearly on), a touch of divine revelation and an\naura of metaphysical mystique which at times\nbefogged and obscured the real facts and\nphenomena of nature. My suspicions grew,\nslowly but constantly,stronger, when I came\nacross statements like Mach's criticism of\nNewton's law of inertia that 'this law has\nattained the dignity and intangible ness of a papal dictum.'j Einstein's own pronouncement that' theories are not fabricated out of\nresults of observation, but they can only be\ninvented'; and Oirac's 'overpowering belief\nthat its (general relativity's) foundations must\nbe correct, quite independent of its\nagreement with observation', etc., etc.\nUnpalatable though the thought may be,\nthere are striking similarities between the\ntheories, methods and concepts of modern\nphysics and those of mystics of all times. My\nfears were amply confirmed when a colle gue of mine drew my attention to 'The Tao of\nPhysics' - a book on sale in the IC bookshop-which, as its subtitle reveals, explores the\nparallels between modern physics and\nEastern mysticism. Dr. F. Capra, the author of this book, who is a theoretical high-energy\nphysicist and has done research at IC, argues\nelegantly and convincingly, that 'a consistent\nview of the world is beginning to emerge from\nmodern physics which is harmonious with\nancient Eastern wisdom'; further,he observes\nthat 'we often encounter statements where it\nis almost impossible to say whether they have\nbeen made by physicists or by' Eastern\nmystics'; furthermore, he remarks that\n'Eastern mysticism provides a consistent and\nbeautiful philosophical framework which can\naccommodate our most advanced theories';\nhe also provides quotations from eminent\nphysicists to support his arguments.\noC7T| t CO\n'\n.\n\u2022\n'\n\u2022\n\u2022\n;\n'\n>\n,\nv. V?, u]'ti \u00a3(fy f? MA - \u2022 (\n\u2022\n\"\n\u2022 V'..'j V.j j> oL\n\u00a9\nICQ\nDr. Capra, by bringing to the fore the\nmanifold similarities between Eastern\nmysticism and modern physics, aims,\napparently, to exalt the former and raise its\nesteem to the high level which the latter has\nattained with the general public and the\npolitical establishment during this century.\nFor this purpose, he claims that 'modern\nphysics is not only based on intuition, but\nalso on experiments of great precision and\nsophistication and on a rigorous and\nconsistent mathematical formulation.'\nOn the other hand, there are other books, in\nparticular, 'Science at the Crossroads' by H. Dingle, a former professor of physics at IC,\nwhom the 'Times' described in an obituary\nnotice, when he died a year ago as an\n'eminent scientist and philosopher', that\nargues inter alia that abstract mathematics\ncannot, by themselves, prove anything in the\nstark reality of nature; moreover, it explains\nwhy exp eft ment s in vol vf ng unobservable and hypothetical, sub microscopic particles (from\nthe more or less 'familiar' proton and neutron\nto the pretty elusive quark and the like)\ncannot yield all the data which Is required to\ntest the validity of theories ana ny po these s which are intended to apply to the very\nfamiliar macro-world of everyday life.\nIrrespectively or w no is right and who is\nwrong, this affair smacks of religion and it is\nnot altogether strange to the unusual fever -one might say sheer frenzy - that has swept\nthe entire globe (and not merely the scientific\ncommunity) of Einstein's centennial\ncelebrations earlier this year. As a result,\npractically everybody has expressed, at one\ntime or another, his adulation of Einstein';\nstunning genius, but I would rather suggest\nthat they also consider the remarkably\nspurious techniques which the media\nregularly employ for promotion purposes.\nEinstein himself, ' would have been appalled\nby all the fuss' say people who knew him\nintimately. There is a good reason, therefore,\nto ask; 'why all the uproar?'\nI suspect that the use of expressions such\nas 'Saint of Science', 'Modern Prometheus',\n'Second Isaiah' which we heard or read in\nconnection with Einstein's life and work are\nnot accidental. In times past, 'the opiate of the\npeople' used to be Gods, prophets and saints\n- religion in general. In our enlightened days,\nsuch luxurious 'commodities' have become\nantiquated and obsolete, and it is rather hard\nto 'sell' them; apparently, they must be\nreplaced - obviously by the exaggerated cult\nof Einstein and his incomprehensible (to the\nuninitiated 'layman' - and to most scientists\nfor that matter) mathematical 'testament'.\nPortraits and statues of Einstein that have\nbeen made for the purpose, run into the\nhundreds, if not thousands, and the whole\nworld has come to think and talk about him\nwith reverence, awe and piety, a practice\nwhich in the past was relevant to deities and\nthe like.\nThis improper 'deification' to the non-scientific public of Einstein and his theories\nis, irrespective of their scientific value,\nuncharacteristic and unacceptable to\nresponsible science; further, it is offending to\nthe humble personality of Einstein, who was,\nduring his lifetime, a perfect example of\nmodesty and humility, who always detested\nmegalomania and despised all forms of\nauthority.\nIt is high time that this despicable\nfalsification, misuse and exploitation of\nscience must come to an end.13 "

    "content": "In the midst of the current crisis at Imperial College,\nJustin Newland relates what it's like to be a Fresher at I.C. 'Freshers, welcome to your first identity crisis.' Anne read the poster,\nred ink on white background, which was plastered across the face other\nSouthside Halls of Residence. Her parents, who had driven her to the\ncollege with all her belongings, preferred to ignore its warning. Her\nmother, a slim, neurotic woman, chatted away in her usual nonsensical\nway, while George, her hen-pecked father, was in the process of making\nhis fifth attempt on the British weight-lifting title - Anne's two suitcases\nweighed a ton.\nHer own thoughts were confused. All she wanted to do was bid her\nparents a final farewell, yet another part of her felt timid and afraid at the\nidea of being left alone in this huge concrete metropolis. With just\nseventeen years behind her, the ambivalent figure of independence now\nfinally stared her right between the eyes.\nIt was a dreary London Saturday on the week-end before term. The\nhand of autumn lay silently over the quaint, typically London gardens:\nthe fallen leaves already whispered 'Winter is coming.' Meanwhile, Anne checked the details of her own ac como dati on, and\nannounced that her room was on the fifth floor of the building. As they\nstood waiting for the lift, numerous scruffy-looking people wandered\nabout aimlessly, some looking completely lost, others trying vainly to\ngive the impression that they weren't completely lost. Behind this\nforeground of confusion there was an air of relaxation and contentment.\nAnne and her mother set off to walk up the stairs and soon reached the\nfifth floor, where they spent the next ten minutes trying to decipher the\nroom-numbering system, which, it is rumoured, was invented by the\nBritish Intelligence Service during the Second World War. After\ndiscovering the location of such essential places as the W.C. and the\nbathroom, they finally stumbled upon her room. Suddenly Anne realised that she'd forgotten to collect her room key.\nKeen to take the opportunity to escape from under her parents' wing,\nshe promptly set off to find someone who could help her. She made her\nway to the kitchen, where a group of five or six girls were avidly\ndiscussing the sexual potential of the male student population.\nOne girl, who introduced herself as Tassya, provided Anne with all the\ninformation she needed. She'd arrived a few days previously, and was\nalready schooled in the difficulties and obstacles strewn across the\ncourse of fresher students. To Anne'sem barras ment, her mother\nappeared. She began complaining about the minute layer of dust which,\naccording to her, covered everything. The other girls patronising ly agreed with her, then fell into silence.\nAt any rate, Anne ran off to fetch the key. She quickly returned. The\nPorter's breath, she had noticed, had smelt of al cho hol. Not surprisingly\nthe key didn't fit the lock. After a return trip, and another five flights of\nstairs, the door was opened. How could such simple things create such\ndifficulties, Anne thought to herself naively. Perhaps it was an omen.\nBut before her was her home-to-be for the forth-coming year. How\nstrange is the air of a tidy, un-lived room. There is something naked and\nbarren about it, yet it's so full of potential .... like a blank canvas to an\nartist. Her mother went into ecstasies over the view onto the gardens.\nFor the sake of being uncompromising, Anne replied that it wasn't exactly a breath-taking panorama. George just grunted, then slumped\ndown on the bed, exhausted.\nAfter a while, Tassya poked her nose in the door. She asked Anne if\nshe wanted to join her and her friends in a sojourn to the bar. They were\ngoing in ten minutes. Anne agreed readily, so her parents decided it was\na propitious time to leave.\nNow began an embarrassing sequence of goodbyes, benedictions,\nand promises to write and phone regularly. Anne's mother was clearly\ndistressed at loosing 'her baby'while George seemed totally indifferent,\nthough tacitly concerned. Anne thanked them both politely, hugged her\nmother and kissed her father lightly on the cheek. In the next moment,\nshe was alone, three years of Life Sciences before her.\nMeanwhile, on the floor above, Robin was unpacking his suitcase. He\npicked up a text book he had already bought for his course in\nComputing Science. The shiny paperback cover reflected what scanty\nsunlight that filtered through the clouds on this groggy London day.\n'What knowledge lies between these covers' he murmured to himself,\nmentally licking his lips in anticipation. How wonderful it would all be.\nYou see, for Robin, learning was the supreme enjoyment, not a chore or\na hobby. He collected knowledge like others collected but er flies, women or memories. If he was fortunate, he would not experience the\napathy and grand disillusionment that invariably arrives after a brief\ntaste of University education. Knowledge, he will find, is only a means,\nbut not an end in itself.\nHe had left Cardiff earlier the same day, where he'd been loath to leave\nhis parents. His danger was that he would bury himself up to his neck in\nbooks, thus avoiding the supremely difficult task which confronts all\nadolescents - the task of developing himself emotionally, as well as\nintellectually.\nFor a person like Robin, a University is also a place to escape from,\namongst other things, the annoying intrusions of the female gender,\nabout whom his knowledge was negligible, not to say non-existent. As\nfar as he was concerned, Mayfair was just a boulevard in London,\nsomewhere in the vicinity of Pall Mall. Secretly, he longed for the mellow\nquiescence of old age, when all the passions have perished.\nAfter all, Beaumarchais had said that the only difference between\nmen and the animals was that men drank when they weren't thirsty and\nprocreated when they didn't need to.\nHe looked at his watch, then remembered that there was an\nintroductory tour of the library he wanted to attend. With an adoring\nglint in his eye, he carefully shelved the text-book next to Chalmers'\nTwentieth Century dictionary, a London A to Z, and a mass of leaflets\nand student handouts that had been thrust into his grubby little paws\nthe moment he had made his entry to Southside. He searched through\nthis accumulation of confusion until he found a map of the locality, the\nhappily marched off to the library.\nJust as he reached the fifth floor, a group of girls, chattering away like\nold women, emerged from their dorm it ary. He was late, and in a dreadful\nhurry, but these girls insisted on walking down the stairs three abreast,\nthus barring his way. They sauntered down the five flights as if they were\nout for a Sunday promenade. Indeed, Anne and Tassya and their friends\nhad donned their finest Sunday dresses for the imminent confrontation\nwith the male population. Clearly, they were about to show that\nBeaumarchais' witty epigram applied equally to women as to men. Robin, a staunch Conservative, decided to take an active interest in\nthe I.C. political life, but only in so far as he voted for anyone wearing a blue rosette. In one election, he tried to vote for a lost Chelsea\nsupporter, to the dismay of several West Ham supporters, who\nhappened to be chasing him through the College. Anne, on the other hand, was more keenly involved, since she was\nalready in the thick of the I.C. political drama. Of course she was an\nardent left-winger, though really only because her parents were\nConservatives. After a while, the nuances between the doctrines ofthe\nTrotskyites, the Marxists, the Neo-Marxists, the Leninists, the Stalinists,\nthe Communists, the Anarchists, and the Socialist tended to become\nslightly blurred in her mind. What amazed her just as much k, was that\nalthough all these political groups were Left-wing, they squabbled and\nargued amongst themselves to such a degree that they never agreed on\nanything, least of all got anything done.\nBut on the occasion of this U. G.M., when you see a hall of people,\ncrammed shoulder to shoulder, it's easy to believe that their either\nelected representatives can wave the political gauntlet with impunity\nand so generate a force which no Rector, Government, or whoever else\nhas incurred the relentless wrath of the Student' Union, can withstand\nfor long. At any rate, the reader can draw his own conclusions on this\npoint, I'm only here to tell you about Anne, Robin and their friends.\nTassya was elected onto a Committee specifically established to\nconsider ways in which the level of bureaucracy, and in particular the\nnumber of Committees, could be reduced. Later she told me that the\ntask was so complicated, they recommended that two more committees\nbe established to ease their burden.\nAt this point, we're going to leave the adventures of Robin and Anne\nuntil we rejoin them on the day of the Fresher's Fair. In the meantime, I 'll\nquickly describe what happened to them in between time, as well as\nsketching something more about their characters. To Anne, it seemed as it she'd met a thousand and one different\npeople. She was certainly enjoying her newly-won freedom. Indeed, she\nhad consummated it on the same night as her arrival by seducing aCC U President. Although she was unaware of it at the time, this was the best\nway for her to make inroads into a social clique, which is the one and\nonly social division at any University. Mind you, if you'd have pressed\nher on the point, she'd have told you that it was she who was seduced by\nthe President. After all, she had to retain a semblance of feminine\nhonour.\nRobin, however, had continued to lead his slavish existence. You've\nprobably seen him around: he's the quiet one who seems to be a loner,\nuntil one day you see him somewhere with a couple of people, who just\nlook his type.\n\n"

    "content": "Dear Colin,\nRe the current Rag Mag:\nIt sinks to depths from which it\nnever recovers starting with the\neditorial. It is crude, racist and\n\u2022depraved. Perhaps the only good\nthing about it, is that it has no\n'page 3' type photographs, but\nthis is more than made up for by\nthe sick jokes and the crossword.\nIt is rather ironic that it is being\nused to raise money for\nhandicapped people when it\nmakes fun of them.\nVarious people have commented\nthat since it is the Rag Mag, it\nought to be allowed to have a certain licence but this one has\nreally gone too far. We believe in\ntaking a fairly open-minded view\nof sex and other matters, but we\ndon't believe in making sick jokes\nabout handicapped people, or\nproducing a mag so blatantly\nsexist or bigoted especially at a place like IC, where sex and race\nare rather touchy subjects.\nIt was interesting to notice, that\nMr Fox and Ms Rae Snee (Rag\nChairman) have disassociated\nthemselves from it, but really this\nis not enough. The executive\nshould have acted as soon as they\nrealized what was happening\nespecially when the first lot of\nprinters refused to print it, due\nto it being obscene. The excuse\nthat by the time they realized what\nwas happening it was too late, is\nnot acceptable because the\nnames of two of them are in the\neditorial disassociating themselves from it. This really is not\ngood enough as it does (and will)\noffend a lot of people and various\nstudent committees are against it.\nThe view taken is that as it has\nbeen produced, it has to be sold to\nrecover the cost. This depends on\nwhether you want to project the\nimage of IC students being\nmind tess depraved zombies. They\nreally should have kept a better\neye on how the money was being\nspent.\nAlthough some of the jokes are\nquite good the mag is really quite\nobscene and it is rather a pity that\nsuch an obviously talented person\nas Mr Marshall should have\nproduced a Rag Mag without\nforeseeing the obvious consequences. Aftab Gujral (O.S. C) Avljlt Chakravarty Mech Eng PG\nP.S. Sagoo (Chem PG)\nJohn Passmore (Pet Eng UG)\nRichard Earl (Physics PG)\nFrank James .... / totally endorse\nwithout any reservation the\nviews expressed above.\nMerche Clark .... on behalf of IS\nwomen attending the ICWA\nGeneral Meeting Oct 9th. Dear Sir,\nOn Friday, 5th October; a poster\nwas hanged in College (a copy of\nwhich is enclosed) claiming its\nsource as IC Islamic Society.\nWe have not issued this poster;\nand it is well known to our\nmembers that 1-2pm is our\nFRIDAY PRAYER TIME, a weekly\nevent which continued since the\nformation of the society. Firstly, I would like to ask whoever played\nsuch a childish trick to come out\nin the open and state his views\nclearly and not claim them on our\nsociety. Secondly, I would like to\npoint out that the Society held a lecture entitled, 'Facts and Events\nAbout the Islamic Revolution in\nIran' given by Dr Abul Fazl Ezzatti\nfrom the University of Tehran. A copy of the poster is also included\n(and will hopefully be published\nwith this article). This later lecture\ndid take place on 14th September.\nMay I point out our inter st in Iran\nat the moment. An Islamic\nrevolution supported by most\nIranians emerged. It ousted the\nShah who had the support of the\nWestern world. Khomeini emerged as an undisputed leader.\nAnyone who has read the Iranian\nConstitution, and followed up the\nevents leading to the revolution;\n.as well as after the revolution will\nrealize that the main aim was to\nestablish an Islamic State as an\nindependent system from others\nsuch as communism, socialism,\nimperialism, and secularism.\nWomen were at the forefront of\nthe revolution. Thus destroying\nthe popular myth that women are\nsuppressed under Islam. We pray\nto God to guide the revolution in a righteous path, so that it can\ndemonstrate the much needed\nIslamic example as a complete\nway of life: social, political,\neconomic, spiritual, as well as a practical way of demonstrating\nthe law brought by the creator to\nhis creation.\nMay I remind non-Arab speaking\nfriends that Islam means\nobedience and submission to God\n- named Allah by the Arabs.\nFinally, I would like to challenge\nthe offender mentioned at the\nbeginning of this letter, to come to\nour next lecture and discussion\nabout Iran, and to stop being a coward and uncivilized as\neveryone is entitled to his view l Yours,\nPresident of Islamic Social\nCommittee\nC^ py deadline\nfor next Friday's issue will be\n5 : 3 0 pm Monday,15 th October Dear Sir,\nI would like to comment on\nMerche Clark's article on the\nCorrie Bill in last week's FELIX.\nFirstly, Merche Clark appears to\nhave signed herself as \"ICWA\nPresident\" but I know that the\nviews expressed in her letter are\nabhorrent to .many members of\nICWA. The usefulness of abortion\nto women students is question-able, and since it is the welfare of\nthese students that Ms. Clark\nshould be concerned with, then\nsurely she is abusing her position.\nIf she wishes to contribute such\narticles to FELIX she should do so\neither as an .individual student or\nas a representative of the anti-life\nsocieties such as the National\nAbortion Campaign.\nHer article opens by saying that\nthe 1967 abortion act entitles\nwomen to abortions in certain\ncircumstances. This is not so. The\nrel event wording of the act will\nbe found in chapter 87 section 1,\nand I quote:\n\"Subject to the provisions of\nthis section, a person shall not be\nguilty of an offence under the law\nrelating to abortion when a pregnancy is terminated by a registered medical practitioner if\ntwo registered medical practitioners are of the opinion, formed\nin good faith \"\nThe act then continues with the\nfrequently quoted circumstances\nin which abortions may be\ncarried out. The wording of the\nabove excerpt does not give any\nwoman a right to abortion, it gives\na doctor the right not to be\nprosecuted for performing an\nabortion under certain c irc um stances. The difference is great. I would suggest that when Merche\nClark writes any article in future\nshe gets the fact correct.\nMs. Clark's analysis of the four\nmain areas, as she defines them,\nof the Corrie Bill is somewhat\nfaulty. For one thing, abortions\nwill not be illegal after twenty\nweeks in cases of foetal\nabnormality or where doctors say\nthat there are serious medical\ngrounds for the abortion. If the\none percent of abortions now\nperformed after twenty weeks are\nonly \"the most desperate and\nserious cases\" then Ms. Clark\nneed not worry; such abortions\nmay still be carried out if the\nCorrie Bill is passed.\nThe changing of the grounds for\nabortion is primarily to return to\nthe 1967 bill in its original\nmeaning - or rather what the bill's sponsors at the time claimed its\nmeaning to be. The wording was\nvery ambiguous and loose, so that\nthe conditions became meaning-less. By going to \"charities\" like\nBPAS virtually any woman can\nhave an abortion; the 1967 act has\nbecome weak and meaningless\nand many of its original\nsupporters are realizing that they\nwere hoodwinked into supporting\nan act with deliberately loose\nwording.\nThe BPAS and PAS \"charities\"\ninvolved in the abortion industry,\nare rightly worried about the\nCorrie Bill. Their existence is\nthreatened. They can avoid this\nproblem if they cut all financial\nand personnel links between the\nagencies and the abortion clinics,\nand then they will be allowed to \u00ab\ncontinue. Perhaps what worries\nthem is the loss of one and a half\nmillion pounds annual income,\nnot the fact that they will no longer\nbe able to provide women with a \"sympathetic service at a reasonable price\".\nMs. Clark then deals with the\nrights of conscientious objectors;\nshe seems to believe that people\nwith a moral objection to abortion\nshould not work in the health\nservice. Yet theoretically this is a civilized country - would we force\npeople to pe form executions or\nforce nuns to administer drugs for\neuthanasia? Abortion, Ms. Clark,\nhas nothing to do with the quality\nof service a doctor provides for his\nor her patients. A pregnant\nwoman is two patients. Finally, I would like to agree with\nMerche Clark on one or two\npoints. \"Have we the right to bring\nchildren into a world when we feel\nwe cannot look after them -though material reasons, social\npressures or whatever?\" My\nanswer is that we have an\nobligation to make the world a fit\nplace to bring the children into;\nthe children have a right to life. I agree that women should be able\nto control their own bodies; but\nnot if to do so they must kill\nanother human being. Most\nwomen who have abortions have\nalready made the choice to risk\npregnancy, and the parents are\nresponsible for the child after\nconception. Abortion is not about\nwhether women have a right to\ncontrol their bodies, but about\nwhether they have a right to\ndecide the future of another,\nhelpless human being. Abo^t whether they have the right to kill\na child.\nMay I urge everybody who is\nconcerned about the present\nmisuse of the abortion act or\nabout the immorality of abortion\nto write to their MPs requesting\nthem to vote for the Corrie bill in\nFebruary? I can supply information on which MPs voted \u2022\nfor and against the bill previously,\nfor anyone interested.\nYours faithfully,\nSean Kelly\nChem 2\n4\n\n"

    "content": "Now Richard, who rather fancied himself as a future Whitehall\nmandarin, thought that an appropriate beginning to such a noble\nvocation would be to join the Organising Committee of the Oxford\nStreet Tiddlywinks contest, which is traditionally held on the first\nSaturday after term begins. For better or worse, he was allocated the\ntask of seeing that no one cheated by surreptitiously placing their\ntid d lys in their pockets, and walking, rather than \"winking\" the course.\nOn the day, he was posted about half way along Oxford Street,\nequipped with his two anti-cheating devices,,,,two lumps of flesh,\nblood, tissue and nerves, four fingers and a thumb. Of course, he had\nthought that all his job would consist of would be first to indent if y the\nlaw breaking win kers, challenge them, then demand that they turn out\ntheir pockets. This ad hoc procedure worked well for a while, until it\nfinally dawned on him that there were members of BOTH sexes\nparticipating in the event.\nAt any rate, after sometime, his Kojak intuition suddenly told him that\na buxom wench who happened to be passing him at the time was acting\nin a grossly suspicious manner. With the unabashed enthusiasm of a spider about to catch a fly trapped in its web, Richard laid both hands on\nhis victim. It was at this point that he realised that his methods of search\nwould have to be radically altered if he was to perform his task properly.\nWith a suspicious glint in his eye, he looked at Anne, then again at what\nshe was wearing a navy blue IC tee shirt over an elegant light blue\nfrock.\n'Where could she hide at idd ly or two?' he wondered to himself. First\nhe took the obvious approach: he body-searched her. With cavalier\ngusto, he felt all over her shapely body, from shoulder to waist and so\non.\nAnne was quite bewildered by all this, although whatever it was, she\nsaid to herself, it was far more pleasant than tid d ly winking. All the same,\nwhen he'd completed this task, which was obviously so distasteful to\nhim, Richard was chagrined to find no incriminating evidence\nwhatsoever. He now went through a prolonged mental debate. Should\nhe make a more thorough search, or perhaps suffer the humiliation of\nbeing outwitted by this foxy lady. All the while, a misc he vio us voice\ninside him kept insisting that this regal specimen of womanhood, who\nstood before him had tid d lys concealed somewhere upon her person.\nWithout further ado, in the middle of Oxford Street, on a lovely\nautumn day, Richard Bignall put his hands up a girl's dress and\npromptly got himself arrested for attempted rape. In reply to Richard's protest that he was 'just looking for tiddlywinks', the arresting officer\nwas heard to comment that in thirty years of dealing with sexual\noffenders, he'd never heard it put like that before. But that's another\nstory.\nAt the end of the afternoon, the gallant competitors assembled at\nPiccadilly Circus to pay their yearly homage to none other than that\nrascal Eros, the son of Aphrodite, the Queen of Lust. It was doubtless\none of his arrows which pricked poor Richard's heart, smiting it with\nblinding passion. Nevertheless, perhaps it is significant that it Is at the\nstatue of Eros, who is both the divine symbol of childhood and the\npersonification of the most playful amorous desire, that a thousand or\nso IC students congregate each year.\nAnne joined in the Ring-o Round-a Rosie in a state of complete\nec stacy: she'd never realised that a tiddlywinks competition, in which,\nincidentally, she was not even participating, could be such a lascivious\nand erotic activity. It was only after she'd downed a few lager and limes\nin the \"Cockney Pride\" that she began to feel the earth beneath her\ndainty feet.\nThe last we heard of Richard was that when the judge asked him if he\nhad anything to say before he was sentenced, he replied, \"Beam me up,\nScottie!\"\nAlso there is no more time to see whether Captain James T. will come\nto Richard's rescue, for here my story ends. As Master of Ceremonies\nof this tale, it just remains to me to bid you a fond farewell. But if you'H bear with me a while longer, I 've penned a few concluding remarks for\nyour edification. -17\n\n"

    "content": "'Woyzeck'\na film by Werner Herzog\nThis haunting production of a German\nRomantic play by George Buchner describes\nthe behaviour of a man within whom the\nembers of sanity are barely alight. Woyzeck,\nis played with frightening intensity by Klaus\nKihski, is an army private at war only within\nhimself.\nNo particular cause of his insanity and\nobsession al tendencies is emphasised,\nexcept that he has been participating in kan\ninhuman medical experiment; the army\nphysician has been feeding him on peas for\nthree months merely to observe the\nphysiological and psychological effects. As a result, Woyzeck suffers from the consuming\nsymptoms of nutritional deprivation; he hears\nvoices and is visited by apocalyptic\nhallucinations.\nIt is significant that he is mad from k the beginning - there is no portrayal of the\ngradual fall from sanity. One's sense of pity\nfor the anti-hero (for he has none of the\nqualities of a classical tragic hero - a high\nstation in life, magna mini ty or dignity) is at\nfirst exacerbated because Woyzeck is so\ntormented by his masters. It soon becomes\nevident that they are victims just as much as\nhe: the Doctor, of his obsession al desire for\nfame through medical discovery; the Captain,\nof his bourgeois values and hyper cho nd ria; and the Drum-Major, Woyzeck's cuckold-maker, of his Aryan arrogance and insensate\nbrutality.\nOnly Marie, Woyzeck's wife, is allowed that\nhuman, all too human virtue of self-awareness. She sees into her own rotten\nnature, and yearns to repent her who r ish tendencies, especially after an amorous\nencounter with the Drum-Major. But\nWoyzeck, perhaps because of his physical\ncondition, is given no trace of self-awareness.\nConsequently, there is no 'realisation' scene,\nan essential feature of the classical concept\nof tragedy. Indeed, it is Woyzeck's ignorance\nof his own condition that disbars him from\ncombating his suffering with any dignity. It\nalso explains why he did not turn the knife on\nhimself after slaughtering his wife in a fit of\njealousy, a jealousy aroused by his\nunrequited love for her.\nThe pathos of the film is made more\npoignant by the use of two dramatic devices\nfrom classical tragedy: the contrast of the\nhumorous and the pathetic; and irony, with\nthe occasional use of prophetic irony. An apt\nexample is the reason why Woyzeck first\nagreed to participate in the Doctor's experiment - he had wanted to earn some\nextra money to give to his wife.\nThus, although Woyzeck is the tragic'hero'\nin the sense that he is the focus of attention, it\nis really society that is condemned as the\n'human' man, he is the only character who\nhas neither vice nor neurosis. A subtle contrast between animal and\nhuman runs through the whole drama:\nWoyzeck's guin es pig status in the Doctor's tragic agent and victim is er, while humanity\nitself is seen as the tragic central figure.\nWrongdoers and wronged alike are the\n(innocent) victims of lust for power, revenge\nand illicit sexual desires in a society rancid\nwith cant and the most horrifying\ncallousness.\nThe only sign of hope in this bleak\nlandscape of futility is Andres, Woyzeck's army comrade and friend. A simple\nexperiment; the 'speaking' horse which he\nand his wife see when they visit the circus;\nand the bestial impulses which manifest\nthemselves in the Drum-Major's lust and\nanimal cruelty and in Woyzeck's savage\nbutchery of his wife.\nHerzog's dispassionate production is set\nagainst a peaceful, rural background. As in\n'The Enigma of Kaspar Hausar', the vivid\nnatural imagery is used with awesome effect.\nBut this man Herzog has a highly developed\nsense of the tragic, as well as a rare attribute\namong film directors, the ability to transpose\na( tragic), play onto celluloid without\ndemolishing it in the process. Now showing at the Paris Pullman Cinema,\nDrayton Gardens, SWIO.\nJustin Newland\nDEF LEPPARD\nDef Leppard is an apt name for a heavy\nmetal rock group, and the band gave early\nnotice that the name is not undeserved. The\nwarning came via the pre-concert sound\ncheck; during which a large number of heads\nwere seen to emerge from Queen Alexandrs\nHouse, and a round of applause emanating\nfrom this building greeted the end of the\ntrack.\nThe actual concert was started by a support\nband, Guilt Edge, who played a set lasting\nabout an hour. Their vocalist ( who is a postgraduate student at IC) was the most\nnotable member of this five piece outfit,\nsinging vocals that were both aggressive and\nexpression ate. What let the band down,\nhowever, was their lead guitarist. His playing\nlacked attack, and often seemed to subdue\nthe effect of the strong rhythm section of the\nband. He also lacked stage pre sc en ce both\nclothes and style of playing admirably\nqualifying him to be Hank Marvin's understudy. However, it was an enjoyable\nsession from a band who while lacking polish\nmade a very acceptable sound. Def Leppard on the other hand are a very\npolished and professional band indeed; with\nthe bass guitarist being particularly adept at\nprojecting his personality from the stage.\nThey play loud heavy metal rock in the classic\nmould. I must admit that with many bands of\nthis genre I have trouble telling one track\nfrom another, thus it seemed to me as if Def\nLeppard played the same track ten different\ntimes. I liked this track though, so I didn't object too much.\nThe rest of the audience also seemed to\nenjoy the band, and by the time the second\ntrack had finished there were at least thirty\n\"head-b angers\" leaping around the front of\nthe hall. Many of these seemed familiar with\nLeppard's music, greeting tracks off their\nrecent EP with cheers. How successful the\nnight was can be judged by the fact that the\ngroup were brought back for two encores by\nsome enthusiastic applause.\nFinally, if any of you want to listen to some\nDef Leppard, they have a single coming out\nshortly. In addition to this, they are doing a series of concerts at the Hammersmith\nOdeon supporting AC/DC, between 1st and\n4th November, with a return visit on 17th December.\nReview by Rees Williams Photos by Nigel Too by "

    "content": "ENTS Films In Muddle\nImperial College ENTS have had\nto rearrange most of their films for\nthis term. Ther films are usually\nshown in the main lecture theatre\nof the Mech Eng Building, room\n220, but the extensive programme\nhas had to be changed, from that\noriginally shown in the fresher s' edition of FELIX.\nNext Thursday's film will be the\n'French Connection' replacing\n'Carrie', which will be shown at a later date. 'Rollerball', originally\ndue to be shown at the Rag film\nnight, will not be shown at all, and\nthe 'Kentucky Fried Movie' due to\nbe shown in November is in some\ndoubt.\nThe reason for all these changes\nhas been due to the lateness in\nbooking by ENTS. Films are\nusually booked towards the end of\nthe summer term, for the\nfollowing session, but this was not\ndone until half way through the\nsummer vacation, this year. The\nresult was that many of the films\nwere no longer available on the\nnights ENTS wanted them.\nHowever, when the situation is\nsorted out another list will be\npresented in FELIX. ICRN\nWindow Collides with Southside\nResident\nOn Tuesday evening, a Southside resident ran through a window. Nick Melling, a first year\ncivil engineer, was heading for his\nroom via the main entrance to\nSouthside, and mistook one of the windows at the side of the doors\nfor an open door. He appeared to\nbe suffering only from minor cuts\nand contusions, but was taken to\nthe casualty department of St\nSteven's for treatment, just in\ncase. ICRN\nShort Life Property Group\nThe short life property group,\nstarted towards the end of last\nterm and will be continuing its\nwork this term. The aims of the\ngroup are to find, renovate,\ndecorate and live in unused\nhousing around London. Rents\nare as low as two or three pounds\non these properties, but they are\nusually very difficult to find. Last\nyear two members of the group\njoined a scheme in Hackney, and\nthey are now living there with a very low rent. Anyone interested\nin joining the group should see\nMichael Arthur in the welfare\noffice. ICRN\nHardship Fund Abused\nThe College Hardship Fund has\nbeen abused by two students who\nwere able to support themselves.\nOne of the students, a Persian\nwhose name has been withheld,\napplied to the hardship fund for\nthree years, during his first\ndegree, but was caught when he\nreturned for his PhD. The student\nhas since repaid all the money he\nobtained from the fund. CINA\nRefectory Suggestion Boxes\nSuggestion boxes will replace\nthe complaints and suggestions\nbooks in the refectories next\nweek. The idea of the boxes is for\nstudents to put their suggestions\nin them instead of the current\nbooks. College decided on the\nboxes instead of the books\nbecause they felt the complaints\nmight be of a more constructive\nnature, if they were to be read only\nby student representatives. It will\nthen be up to these representatives to comp la if i to the staff\ninvolved, in the kitchen responsible for the food.\nICRN\nVso/Iege ofi\n)a en ce won\nThe Royal College of Science Union Rag Committee wish to thank everyone\nwho helped collect \u00a3733.57 on the\ntid d ly winking rag stunt on Saturday.\nThe top three Rag collectors were:\nZo sia Zb rez nia k with \u00a353.40\nJames Powell( Maths 1) \u00a330.68\nJaneL avers and HelenE mm s,( both of Life Sciences 1) with \u00a330.40.\nYet again I have been asked to plug\nthe Freshers' Dinners.

A meeting with just about the required\nquorum of th j/ ee hundred managed to wade\nits way through reports, motions and bye-law\nchanges, covering such diverse and\ncontroversial topics, as the executive sacking\nthe sabbatical FELIX Editor, some members\nof the Royal School of Mines playing an\ninvitation rugby match with a South African\nteam, the need to mobilize the student\nmovement to fight education cuts, etc. etc., in\nlittle over thr it y minutes.\nA description of the effect of a bar night on\nSean O 'Boyle's( RCSU president) vocal\nchords raised the most response from the\nmeeting, with almost a ripple of appreciative\nlaughter.\nJust after this slight stirring, the Mines\nUnion report was interrupted by a young lady\n(whose name I did not catch) questioning the\nright to report an event to a meeting in\ncontravention of union policy. This said event\nbeing the proposed rugby match with a South\nAfrican team. I think it was only reasonable\nthat we could have expected a few good\nstirring speeches attacking the flagrant\nreactionary racists in Minesorcommending\ntheir protection of the right to freedom of\nchoice in sport. We were, needless to say,\ndisappointed.\nAt last the meeting reached the main item\non the agenda - a motion on education cuts\nproposed by the ICU President (whose vocal\nchords were holding up quite well). Not an\ninspired speech - but at least an attempt. On\nbeing told, however, of the imperative for the\nstudent movement to get off its arse, our\nunion members were seen to merely slump\nfurther in their seats.\nThe chair throughout the meeting was\nconducted efficiently by the new chairman,\nMick Berry, but then he did have little to\ncontend with.\nThe lack of inspired controversy at this\nmeeting could perhaps be blamed on this guy\nJudice (who is he anyway?).\nPolitical Prisoner Released\nThe IC Amnesty International Group has heard\nrecently that one of their adopted prisoners of\nconscience has been released. He is Mr Ben Mpa bang aNy at hi from Zimbabwe Rhodesia. He was arrested in1973 under the emergency powers\nregulations, on completing a seven-year sentence\nfor a political offence. He was never tried or even\ncharged after his arrest, and this is why Amnesty\ntook up his case. At no time was the prisoner\ninvolved in violent political action. Over150 political detainees were released in\nZimbabwe in July and August, in what seems to\nhave been an attempt to increase support for, and\ncredibility of, Bishop M uz ore wa's administration.\nMr Nya thi was amongst these people. Anyone who would like to help in the work done\nby Amnesty International is welcome to come to\ndie meetings of the college groups at 5:30pm on\nTuesday evenings, which are usually in the green\ncommittee room on the third floor of the Union, or\nring Owen Green, int. 2962 or Hugh Tinsley, int.\n2575.\nCommunist Society\nMOLE DIGS REVOLUTION\n\"Well,\" said Kevin, looking at his watch, \"how\nlong will it take to get Socialism?\"\nMole looked aghast. \"You'll have to wait for\nthe correct revolutionary conditions,\" he\neventually murmured.\n\"Will it be very bloody?\" asked John.\n\"I certainly hope not - don't you?\" replied\nmole. \"I think maybe we ought to have a discussion at one of our Monday evening\nmeetings in order to sort out some of these\nquestions.\"\n\"What a good ideal\" exclaimed Barrie. \"Of\ncourse, the important thing to remember is\nthat changes in society can only be brought\nabout through mass participation and\nstruggle of ordinary people- beware of liberal\nporcupines and tory badgers, who would\nhave you believe that socialists are anti-democratic - socialism can only exist in\nBritain if it is the expression of the democratic will of the people\" mole said' sage ly. Paul at that point stirred and suggested that\nthey discuss all this next week. The others\nwould have agreed but they were already in\nthe bar.\nCommunist Society discussion meeting\nRoads to Socialism\nMonday, 15th October 6:30pm ICWA Lounge\n\n"

    "content": "ROYAL\nSCHOOL\nOF MINES\nBy now everyone should have settled into\nthe routine of College life (lectures, beer,\npracticals, beer etc). Freshers' week went off\nwith its customary bang, with the Union\nMeeting, Freshers' Fair, Sports Trials, Bar\nNight and Pub Crawl.\nThe slop shirt stock was depleted by the\nFreshers' Fair, so if you still want some regalia\nget along to the RSM Union Office PDQ! The\nturnout for the sports trials was good and\nthings look promising for the coming season.\nOn Friday night, if anyone can remember it,\nthe pub crawl 'occurred'; some marshals\nbeing in a worse state than the competitors.\nThe fun now is to find out where exactly those\npubs are l If you still have your score sheet, please hand it in to the Union Office.\nThis event inevitably took its toll on the\ntiddlywinks next morning, but there was a good attendance; many thanks to all those\nwho turned up to tid dle their winks.\nThe infamous Mines Freshers' Dinners are\nback with their usual intellectual\nconversation over a quiet drink. The dates\nare:\nFriday, 12th October: Geology\nFriday, 19th October: Met & Mat Sci.\nFriday, 26th October: Min. Res. Eng.\nThese dinners are far from dull and sober\noccasions for fresher s and old logs to meet\n(i.e. fall over) each other and generally get\npissed and have a good time.\nDress in a suit or anything resembling one,\nbut PLEASE bring a change of clothing. More\nextensive details will be given to you over the\nnext few days.\nForeign Students Trips\nWe have been invited to send two\nrepresentatives to the International Weeks in\nTrondheim, Norway (Oct 28th Nov 3rd) and\nKracow, Poland (Nov 11th17 th). Ask anyone\nwho has been on one of these weeks and you\nwill be told how good they are - the days\nbeing taken up by industrial visits and the\nnights by parties and the odd drink or two.\nIf you have any queries (or if you have any\nqueer ies then see Rick Wilson, Hon.\nPornographer) then see the R SMU noticeboard or Mike Lee. Remember - whilst\nthere the host universities pay for everything\nand the RSMU endeavours to subsidize your\nfare by up to fifty percent..So get a friend or\nsomeone and put your names on the list.\nTHE COPYDATE FOR THE NEXT MINES\nNEWSLETTER IS MON. OCT 16TH, SO GET\nOFF YOUR BACKSIDES AND WRITE\nSOMETHING AND HAND IT IN TO THE\nUNION OFFICE.\nFuture Events\nMines Disco: Sorry about the postponement,\na new date is being finalized. Oct. 18th: ELECTION UGM. This is a very\nimportant meeting - please po me along and\nvote for a new president (if you don't know by\nnow, the last one failed).\nOct 31st: Halloween Party\nNov 4th: Nottingham Rugby Sevens and\nFootball Sixes.\nALKY MALKY WRITES\nAGAIN\nFRESHERS' FAIR\nThis went quite smoothly this year (except\nfor a few little accidents with hot air balloons).\nI would like to thank Mr. Mooney for his cooperation with our using the refectories, and\nMr. Clark of Estates for permission to use the\nQueen's Lawn.\nI 've received a complaint that some people\nstarted playing football on the Queen's Lawn;\nthis is a very carefully kept lawn, which we\nwere lucky to be allowed to use, and I don't expect to see people playing on it again.\nI 've also received some complaints about\ncertain societies who did not appear to be\nvery keen to recruit new members; if you have\nany experience of this happening, do come\nand see me (in complete confidence, of\ncourse) and I 'll have a word with the people\nresponsible.\nDUTY OFFICERS\nCould all Council members please come\nand see me as soon as possible to discuss\nwhich nights would be most convenient for\nthem to act as duty officers so that I can draw\nup a rota.\nCRASH PAD\nOnly a few people left in Crash Pad at the\nmoment; I hope to be able to close it by the\nend of the week.\nSOUTH AFRICAN RUGBY TOUR As most of you will know by now, a rugby\nmatch (or at least, half of one) took place on\nSunday between a team from a South African\nmining company and an invitation team\ncomprising mainly members of IC, the match\nhaving been mainly arranged by RSMU.\nAfter the match, myself and several people\nwho had been demonstrating outside the\nplayers' hotel that morning, went to discuss\nthe situation in South Africa with the touring\nteam (at their invitation) in the hotel bar. As a C&G UNION Since writing the last article many things\nhave happened during the first week. On\nMonday, we held our reception in the Concert\nHall with introductions to various Union\npeople and tours with 'small' groups (not\nmore than twenty) around College. The\nUnion Meeting on Tuesday was a great\nsuccess, most Exec members being hit by\nflying objects (Nab retaliated very\nsuccessfully). The assembled Guildsmen and\nwomen learnt the Boomalaka and used it with\ngreat effect to raise the roof in ME 220. The\nBar Night on Thursday was a very well\nattended and boozy affair. Some excellent\nyards were drunk, with demonstrations of the\nwrong way by Mr Kalsi and the right way by\nMr Lakin. The Boat Races were won by Elec\nEng 2 ('We woz robbed,' P. Leggett), also the\nsinging was very loud.\nSaturday saw the first Rag collection of the\nyear with Guilds collecting \u00a3747.50 bringing\nour Rag total to over \u00a3800, not bad for the first\nweek (better than RCS). The tid d ly winking result of this discussion, I was satisfied that\nthe team realized how strongly the majority of\npeople in this country feel against the\napartheid system.\nLater that evening, nine of the players were\ninvited back for a drink in the Real Ale Bar in\nSouthside and signed in as visitors, despite\nan assurance I had been given the previous\nday by Bernie Pryor (RSMU Acting\nPresident) that this would not happen. A number of people drinking in Stan's Bar,\nincluding that evening's duty officer, Kirsten\nPratt, objected to their presence and asked\nme to have them removed, and, if necessary,\ncalling in the police to do so. I refused to do\nthis, since I felt that the anti-apartheid\nviewpoint had been sufficiently stressed by\nthe events of the afternoon and earlier that\nevening, and that any further action against\nthem would be unnecessary and possibly\ncounter-productive. However, I would like to\napologize to Kirsten for the very upsetting\nposition I had put her in by having appointed\nher as duty officer that evening.\nNone of the visiting players caused any\ntrouble during the evening, unlike an ex-RSMU member whom I had to have thrown\nout of the bar for a comment he made to the\nduty officer. I will not put up with people\nabusing duty officers under any\ncircumstances - and everybody had better\nremember it.\nMINES FRESHERS' DINNERS\nI'd like to thank the Mines Executive for\ntheir invitation to one of their fresher s' dinners; unfortunately I feel unable to accept\nthis, despite having attended one last year\n(and having thoroughly enjoyed it!). The\nreason is simple; women are not allowed to\nattend their departmental fresher s' dinners.\nCertain members of RSMU may give various\nspurious reasons for supporting this system,\nbut the fact remains that it involves blatant\ndisc r imation against women, which I will not\naccept as being correct under any\nci rum stances, and therefore feel that it\nwould be improper for me to represent ICU at\nany such dinners.\nMALCOLM BRAIN\ntook place as usual with some people winking\nall the way up the steps of Eros. Despite a slight difference of opinion with the boys in\nblue, all of Guilds made it to the Cockney\nPride, even though a large number of winks\nwere lost down drains, up trouser legs or just\ninto thin air.\nThe Events to come are the Freshers'\nDinners, so hurry up and buy your tickets\n(see advert for details). The Roadshow is on\nSaturday 13th at 8:00pm, buy your tickets\nsoon at the ric icu lou sly low price of \u00a31 in\nadvance. Silly sports is the next Rag event on\nSaturday, 20th, meet in the Union Office at\n9:00am for some fun with the shoppers\noutside Harrods.\nBryan\nC& GU8 "
