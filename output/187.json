The Thesaurus has probably\ngot a whole collection of suitable phrases for the occasion\u2014Trojan\nhorse, secret weapon, bolt out of the blue, or just pure and simple,\na big shock for the Union. The issue ? NUS, of course. The\nunexpected oration by President Chandmal at a crucial moment in\nthe debate has led to doubts about the validity of what can only be\ndescribed as a marginal majority, and has undoubtedly led to a serious loss of confidence in the man himself.\nIf, as seems likely, the President's intention was to clinch the\nissue, he certainly failed. The issue is certainly not a dead letter,\nwhich in a way is a pity. Lively interest created in the Union is all\nvery well, but not when it can lead to public airing of dirty linen.\nON THE SIGHT\nCOLCUTT\nWhat a Union Meeting! So\nwe are in N.U.S. Or are we?\nMany people think Mr. Chandmai has gone too far this time.\nWell it was a bit unconstitutional\nspeaking after the final summing-up. Did I say unconstitutional ?\nLet's face it, I.C. has not got a constitution, just a set of bye-laws, which are O.K. so long as\nwe have a President that we can\ntrust. The Union Meeting was a disgrace\u2014a mockery of demo-c racy. I wish to apologise to my\nreaders for misleading them. I was sold up the river by this\n\"politician\" too. In the 180\nissue I said \" perhaps he will turn\nout to be one of the best Presidents this college has had,\" in the\n182 issue I said, \" Colcutt, like\nAsit Chandmal is neutral.\" I have shown to be wrong. Let's hope that Mr. Chandmal realises\nthat he was wrong before it is too\nlate. Somehow I think it is too\nlate.\nI see my friend Mr. Harris has\nat last revealed the ramifications\nof his troubled mind. He makes\na lot of good points in an article\nwritten in his own inimitably\nhilarious style. A scientific training certainly makes you think\nstraight\u2014what a pity we haven't enough men like him to devote\ntime to his schemes. \" Dan the\nBomb \" tried to organise foreign\nstudents at the expense of his\nacademic work. Who is going\nto run our lodgings bureau and\nnon-organised social activities for\nanti-social Union members who\ndo not wish to join organised\nclubs. Anyone spending too\nmuch time running' the Union\nwill not get a degree. Still, never\nmind, NUS will run the Union for\nus. Trouble is, we still need six\npeople with enough spare time to\nbe a delegate to the NUS con-ference s, and still satisfy their\ntutors and examiners. The only\nsolution would be to become a Technical College and make\nChandmal President.\nDear Sir,\nAs a rational member of this\nUnion, I should like, through\nyour columns, to express my surprise and disgust at the handling\nof the NUS debate by Union President Chandmal. Entering the\nUnion Meeting undecided, I was\nsurprised that it was not until\n2.25 that a speaker against the\nmotion was given the floor, the\nchairman allowing a speaker\n\"for\" to have his say although\nhe had clearly called for a speaker against. I presumed that\nthe President had done this due to\ninexperience, but was able to\nmake my mind up after the summing up speeches.\nImagine my horror and disgust\nwhen after the \" final \" summing-up speeches, the President, without de-robing, and without regard\nto his office as chairman, with its\nimplied neutrality, spoke his unexpected piece, just as people\nwere marking their ballot papers.\nNo opportunity was given to\nthe opposers to reply to this last\noutburst.\nIt seems to me that in view of\nthe deplorable action of the President and the very small majority\n(16 in a count of over 800) the\nresult must be considered invalid.\nI therefore call upon the President to have the issue debated at\na further Union Meeting : if he\nfeels so strongly about the matter\nhe is perfectly entitled to hand\nover the chair to some neutral\nperson, and say his piece at the\nproper time. We can then dec'de\none way or another w tih out any\nrecourse to what can only be described as shoddy tactics.\nA.D.

    "content": "FELIX9 IC AND THE WEATHER\nBy the Sports Editor\nDespite the effects of the weather on their activities, the \" big\nthree\" sports clubs are holding regular training sessions in an\nendeavour to maintain all-round physical fitness.\nThe first XI who have yet to play their second round Challenge\nCup match against Goldsmiths, have a varied programme which\nincludes swimming, circuit training, and cross-country running. The\nHockey Club admit to playing the occasional game of basketball\nwhile the Rugby Club are making\nevery effort to ensure success in\nthe UL Sevens Tournament, beginning on March 2nd. As far as women are concerned\na reliable ICWSC source interviewed recently disclosed that\n\" we are confining ourselves to indoor activities.\" The details of\nthe training programme have not\nbeen released.\nThe other Clubs report steady\nattendances, the Swimming Club\nbeing the most active. With three\nteams entered in the UL Water\nPolo League, there are games\nevery Friday, and the first team\nplayers are averaging two games\na week. The hardiest sportsmen\nin the College appear to be the\nmembers of the Boat Club\u2014\nWednesday and Saturday outings\nhave continued unbroken by the\nArctic conditions, the Thames refusing to freeze over at Putney.\nFuture prospects ? Harlington\nis still covered with a layer of ice\nand snow, and there is little likelihood of matches being played\nthere until at least a week after\nthe thaw sets in for good.\nMeantime, anyone for chess ?\nFOR SPORT UNAFFECTED\nBY THE WE A THE RTAKE UP SQUASH\nThe Captain of Squash is feeling smug. There can be few\nother sports clubs which can\nclaim to have achieved \" business as usual\" throughout the\ncold spell.\nThe largest event this term was\nour week end at Oxford on 26th27 th January. Despite the\ngloomy weather forecasts from\nthe AA, our fleet of five cars, containing three teams arrived without mishap.\nOn Saturday afternoon, our\npride was shattered. Not only\ndid all the teams lose, but the first\nV, with a previous record of 15\nwins out of 16 games, was routed\n5\u20140 by St. Edmund's Hall. This\nCollege we had defeated\nby the same margin last term.\nPerhaps there were extenuating\ncircumstances \u2014\u2022 notably a thin\nlayer of ice over the playing\nwalls, making the ballistics of the\nball quite unpredictable. Nevertheless, the same difficulties\nfaced our opponents, and we were\nfairly defeated.\nThe 2nd team were playing\nanother College, Queens, using\nthe next door court. They encountered similar icy conditions\nbut acquitted themselves better,\njust losing by three marches to\ntwo. The girls' team played Oxford Univ. losing 5^0. They\nthen returned to London alone.\nYHA GROUP\nwhich seemed an unwise move\nwithout the care and protection\nof the men's teams. ,\nThe evening was spent in a variety of fashions. No detailed\nstatistics are available, but the\nCaptain can confidently report\nthat no one spent it preparing for\nthe next days' matches. In the\ntheatre, I had a brief moment of\nembarrass a ment when I was\nfound in the corner of the bar,\nnot only drinking a glass of Alka\nSeltzer, but offering some to the\nbarmaid as well. However, I got\nmy own back when I caught Dick\nGibbons snoring his way through\nthe second act. Peace finally descended on Oxford in the small\nhours when Adrian Erskine\nstopped throwing snowballs\nthrough the window to attract\nhis landlady's attention.\nSunday morning saw the first\nteam scoring the first victory of\nthe weekend, defeating Worcester College 4\u2014I. After lunch\nboth teams played a final match,\nthe first V defeating Magdaleen\n5\u20140, the second losing to Keble\n3\u20142. After that, we split up\nseven staid and sober PCs returned to London, while the three\nundergraduates stayed on for a final cocktail party.\nThis rather brings me to a final\npoint, link>ed with the title of this\narticle. Where are our up and\ncoming undergraduate squash\nplayers ? Of the twelve players\nwho have played for the first\nteam this session, only one is an\nundergraduate. Unless some of\nyou take the game up quickly, we\nshall run out of players in a year\nor so.\nPETER SCHOFIELD.\nRUGBY FIVES CLUB\nFortunes have been mixed so\nfar this season. Of the first team\nfixtures, the match against a very\nstrong St. Thomas's Hospital\nteam (which included three UL\nplayers) resulted in a draw. The\ngame against UL 2nd team was\nwon quite comfortably, but a team weakened by reserves suffered defeat at the hands of the\nJesters Club. We were also\nbeaten by Glove Club. .\nFixtures in the near future include St. John's, Cambridge,\nBank of England, and a return\nfixture with St. Thomas' Hospital.\nAs soon as the courts are de-snowed, it is hoped to renew the\nWednesday afternoon practise\ngames^anyone wishing to play is\nwelcome to come along. We con\ntin ue to pray for covered courts.\nS. McF.B.A GOOD WEEK-END IN\nYORKSHIRE\nLate on Friday, 1st February,\na coach load of Y HA members\nfrom IC, QEC and Bedford College set off for Malham, in the\nWest Riding, near Skipton. The\nsnowy weather, which promised\ngood walking, did not however\nlend itself to driving 200 miles.\nThe coach skidded first in the\nEdgware Road, but neither this\nnor the frequent snow showers on\nan icy road prevented our driving\nup the Al at high speeds. We\nreached Malham Youth Hostel\nwith time in hand, after passing\nSkipton where some of us\nstraightened out an articulated\nlorry that was blocking the road.\nSaturday and Sunday were days\nof beautiful sunshine, that left\neveryone two shades browner,\nand this, coupled with the few\ninches of snow, was probably the\nbest weather enjoyed on a winter\nweekend for some years.\nOn Saturday, most of the party\nvisited Malham Cave, the geologists' paradise, and nearby Malham Tarn, which appeared\nmerely as a large flat area. We\nreturned to Malham for lunch\n(two pubs) and in the afternoon\nvisited Gardale Scar, where 200\nfoot limestone cliffs overhang the\nstream, before spending the night\nin the very comfortable hostel.\nOn Sunday, a longer walk\nacross the moors in search of a small and more elusive cave was\nenjoyed by all, returning to Malham for tea, then boarding the\ncoach for the return journey. The\nroads were much better coming\nback, and after an uneventful\njourney, we returned to the Union\nand sought our respective beds.\nR.E. HOBBS,\nSec.

Farrell\nApart from the three or four\nplays already reviewed, there is\nnothing new in the West End,\nwhich can be honestly re com mended, so I'm shouting about\nsomething new this Week.\nWould you like to hear, in the\ncoming month, Andor Foldes\nplaying Bartok, or John Ogden\nplaying Messiaen ? Would you\nlike to hear Mozart's Violin Concerto in A Major, Bartok's violin\nconcerto, a\" first performance,\"\nStravinsky's\" Orpheus \"? Would\nyou accept tickets for these and\nsimilar concerts for one year absolutely free ?\nThe performances are given in\na warm comfortable hall, a nine-penny bus ride from Oxford Circus and are designed to satisfy\nand excite the most jaded music\nlover. There are two concerts\na week, on Saturdays and Thursdays, and apart from being musically of the highest standard,\nthey are a useful jumping off\npoint for those whose musical\nawareness somehow gets stuck at\nabout 1900 (discounting the jazzy\nbits in Stravinsky and the gooey\nbits in Rachmaninoff.) This is\na vital hurdle to jump\u2014to catch\nup with those when who are\nthinking, feeling, suffering in the\nsame climate as ourselves, without comfortable romantic certainties or, apparently, agreed principles of any sort.\nThe content of a typical concert would be Hindemith-BachBartok, with frequent excursions\nto the extreme avant garde on the\none hand, and on the other, the\ncool, refreshing motifs of the\nseventeenth century. A quarterly\nreview of all these concerts is\navailable free and on receiving\nthis, one can send off for all the\ncomplementary tickets required\nfor that quarter.\nSo if the processed musical\ndiet of gramophone, radio, and\nTV is slowly transforming you\ninto a pop culture moron, wh v not write off to rich Auntie BBC\nand ask to be invited to some of\nher concerts (on the Third, of\ncourse).\nLAMLEY'S TECHNICAL & GENERAL\nBOOKS\nART MATERIALS\nDRAWING INSTRUMENTS\nSTATIONERY\nPAPERBACKS\n1. 3 & 5 EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.7.

Dear Urgent,\nHaving read this report with\nMary, we were also worried by\nthe fact that none of our friends\nwere living together either.

I am\nsure that IC can fit you in some-where.\nDear A.L., What is your opinion of a friend of mine who regularly\ntakes, girls out, and is friendly towards them.

Are these really the three pillars of wisdom upon\nwhich this union stand\nThere also springs to mind the comment that appeared in a recent \"Felix,\" after remarking that C.E.M. had knocked us out\nof the Cup in both Rugby and Hockey\u2014\" They must be a big\nCollege. Naturally they must be\u2014if they can beat us !\"\nFor the people who actively participate in the Union there is a considerable amount of enjoyment to be obtained. But to the rest\nwho don't \u2014i.e., the majority\u2014this Union probably doesn't seem all\nthat is is cracked up to be.\n\" But\" what more can we do ? We provide all the facilities we\ncould, don't we ? Far more than most other Colleges do. After all\nthese people just aren't interested.\"\nNot interested in what ? The providing extensive sports and re\nthings those who run the Union\nsay they should be interested in ?\nIt is a difficult situation for a college expanding as rapidly as\nthis one, with such a large P.G. to undergraduate ratio, and so\nmany overseas students. But does\nVOLUNTARY SERVICE AT HOME You are all no doubt aware\nthis is Overseas Service Week : a week during which I.C. students\nare being encouraged to go\nabroad, after graduating, and extend a technically helping hand to\ntheir fellow World Citizens of the\ndeveloping countries. While hoping that this campaign has all the\nsuccess that it deserves one\nrealises that there must be many\namong us who, though keen to\nengage in voluntary service, find\nit impossible, for one reason or\nanother, to go abroad.\nThe Commonwealth Service\nGroup was set up specially to\ntap this enthusiasm. It is a group\nof young people in the 18-plus\nage range who* offer their services\nto promote racial integration in\nthis country. This work takes\nplace of necessity mainly among\nimmigrants. The group tries to\nachieve its ends by three main\nmethods. (1) Learning more\nabout Commonwealth countries\nfrom lectures and films at\nmonthly meetings. (2) Working\nfor im mie rants.(3) Attracting\nCommonwealth young people\ninto the Group and so working\nwith, as well as for, overseas\nmembers of the Commonwealth.\n(This last method has been singularly un success fi* in that the vast\nmajority of mer be rs are natives\nof this country.) Membership of\nthis Group re qu 'es no practical\nqualifications, c ly a desire to\nhelp with the v rk projects organised during ; ime weekends :\nand members mr give as much\nor as little of th r spare time as\nthe v choose.

It's not the building, or\na set of rules or even the small\ngroup of people who profess to\nrun it. It's all the people who\nmake up that Union. Every\nsingle student who is a member is\nan integral part, and without his\nparticipation in some way, no\nmatter how small, both he and\nthe Union lose something. The\ngreatest thing about a Student\nUnion is the opportunity to meet\nothers of widely differing races\nand beliefs, whether through\nplaying in a soccer team, or just\nchatting over coffee. I feel sure\nthat a lot more emphasis could\nbe put on non-sporting activities\nat this college than is at present,\nand try to give more of a University atmosphere. I remember\nfeeling this atmosphere1 only once.\nAnd that was at a Southampton\nUniversity carnival rag. We went\ndown there to avenge the stealing of one of our mobile mascots,\nand finally ended up frater ni sing with the \" enemy,\" and I remember quite enjoying their Carnival\nBall, but not the hitch-hiking\nhome at 4.0 the next morning.\nThat was in my first year, and\never since I have been longing to\nsee a more personal atmosphere\nintroduced here too.\nOne of the main complaints of\nthose who try to run a Union is\nthe amount of apathy one finds.\nBut how do you define apathy ?\nIf a fellow happens to be more\ninterested in something other than\nwhat you are trying to arrange\nfor him, do you blame him for\nhot bothering ? Would it not be\na good idea to find out what\nthese outside interests are, and\nwhy he prefers them to college\naffairs. Could it be we have not\nprovided all the facilities we\ncould ?\nDid you, for example, enjoy\nlast Christmas ? Did you once\nagain bring up enough of your\nover-eating to feed a dozen\npeople ?

He started by saying that\na Union should provide a service\nto its members ; this the ICU did\nvery well, but Is. 3d. seemed a small price to pay to extend these\nservices very considerably. He\nwent on to show some of the\nworkings of NUS and proved inconclusively that IC could not be\nswamped or dominated.\nAnother excellent speech came\nfrom Mr. Oldfield, leaning benignly on the lec turn, and questioning the power of NUS in both\nUnion and individual cases. Recently Battersea College Union\nclosed and NUS could at best\nmaintain a meaningless \" watching brief.\" Strangely this point\nwas never answered by the opposition. MEETING SLOWS DOWN\nMANY LEAVE By this stage in the debate\npeople were getting restless. It\nwas almost three o 'clock, and the\nflow of speakers showed no sign\nof abating. CMany had left for\nlectures, and more continued to\nstream out. A promise by the\nChairman to limit the speeches\ntemporarily halted the exodus.\nMr. Turner gave a good personal\nspeech defending the principle of\nUnions and saying that most\nwould be prepared to pay to go\nto the Presidents Ball. He ended\non the phrase, \" the case for NUS\nis completely and utterly unanswerable.\" Strong stuff, but for\na debater, a rather confined out-look.\nMr. Preece, the Secretary of the\nUnion, followed with the rather\nvague idea that more work would\nnot be a good thing ; he said he\nwas speaking for himself, how-ever, and not for the executive\nin general.\nSUMMING UP\nSTAGEY UNBEATABLE Mr. Stacey gave one of the\nmost polished and convincing\nspeeches heard in the Union for\na long time. A pity there was\nnot a greater number present to\nwitness it; certainly it was the\nbest of the day. He was per-tur bed, first by the emphasis on\nmoral obligation by the proposer,\nand secondly by the timing of the\nmotion. This, he pointed out,\nwas the most famous cause\ncelebr e of Mr. Finch's; why had\nthe voice of conscience allowed\nhim to rest so long and so well\n(three years).\nCHURCHILL QUOTED\nIn support of his above mentioned remarks Mr. Stacey quoted\n\" It is a fine thing to be honest,\nbut it is also important to be\nright.\" And on concessions he\nadded that these can be obtained\nby anyone; \" Philanthropy is a rare thing in commerce.\" Mr.\nStacey could not accept that NUS\nwas solely responsible for all the\nthings for which they campaign,\nand further suggested that the\nNUS administration was not as\nefficient as it might be. Mr.\nBerry's indignant \" a most indelicate suggestion\" was shouted\ndown and the ex-secretary of the\nunion continued. After praising\nIC and emphasising the responsibilities of its members to their\npredecessors, he defended the\npurchase of gliders and boats (not\neven NUS can get them cut\nprice). He ended with the sentiment that the motion was ill-timed since money is: short with\nthe present programme of expansion : \" We are faced with a stranglehold, the motion is ill-judged.\" This was superb oratory and for the first time the\nopposition began to look conf i dent.\nAfter this Mr. Finch completed\nhis summing up, but his speech\nappeared listless and uninspired\nafter that of his' predecessor.\nCHANDMAL SPEAKS\nILL TIMED MOVE It was at this moment that the\nPresident, apparently incensed by\nwhat had gone before, asked if he\nmight state his views. The debate\nwas closed and the summing up\ncomplete. While still in the chair\nhe stated : (1) that the extra work\ninvolved was negligible.; (2) that\nthe financial problem was in con sequential, and (3) that \"IC could\nnot remain a princely cloister in\nPrince Consort Road, but must\nhave a window on the open world\nby joining NUS.\"\nIn his defence it is true that the\naudience did not object when\nasked, and true also that he was\nrefuting misleading information ;\nbut his method was dubious.\nBAD PRESENTATION BY\nOPPOSITION\n\" ALL MAD\" It is a pity that the opposition\ndid not plan their attack in more\norderly fashion ; they drove away\nthe votes when they most needed\nthem, and were at their brilliant\nbest at the least effective time.\nA final comment on the afternoon was passed by some of the\nparticipants:\n\" Fair debate\" said Finch,\nwhile Mr. Oldfield took a different view, \" I am not satisfied\nthat Mr. Chandmal had the right\nto influence the voting in the\nunderhand manner in which he\ndid.\" Mr. Phillips took the attitude \" Debaters twisted my\nwords,\" and from the President\nhimself:\n\" We are all mad.\"\nPRESIDENT REPLIES\nTO CRITICISM\nFirst a factual correction : the proposer of the NUS motion\nfinished speaking at 1.55 p.m. Then I said, \" It is customary for the\nsecond er of the motion to speak immediately after the proposer, but\nsince the proposer, Mr. Finch, has spoken for 25 minutes, I feel we\nshould have a speech against the motion.\"\u2014Time 1.56 (not 2.25). At\n2.25 Mr. Phillips was speaking the second speech against the motion.\nImmediately after Mr. Pearson had finished seconding the\nmotion, I asked for a speech against. When the gentleman who\ncame on to the platform actually spoke in favour of the motion, I was as astonished as everyone else.\nIt is interesting to note Mr. Stacey's comment. I wonder whether\nhe felt the same way last year, when President Si Lyle (under whom\nMr. Stacey was Secretary) did exactly the same thing, viz., indicated\nwhich side of the motion he was just before he called for the vote.\n1 presume he did, for Mr. Stacey is an honourable man.\nMy justification for my action is twofold :\n1. PRECEDENT\nThe President of ICU is not the chairman of a debating society ;\nvery often he gives his views for or against the motion just before\nthe vote is taken. This was done last year, and several years ago,\nand again, by me this year.\n2 .ASSENT\nIn spite of precedent, I clearly asked the consent of the Union\nMeeting in the following words: \" Several people have asked me to\ncommit myself on the NUS issue. Is it your wish that I give my\nopinion on the NUS issue in less than 45 seconds ?\"\nSeveral people shouted \" Ye,\" and no one objected. I therefore felt that I had the unanimous consent of the Union Meeting,\ntacit or vocal. (It is significant also that there were no objections\nforthcoming when I had finished speaking.)\nOn the basis of these two\u2014precedent, and common consent, I feel that my actions were fully justified.\nASIT CHAND MAL, President,\nImperial College Union.\nROYAL NAVAL\nSCIENTIFIC SERVICE\nVACANCIES in Research Establishments mainly in SOUTH\nand SOUTH WEST ENGLAND.\nPHYSICISTS\nMECHANICAL ENGINEERS\nELECTRICAL ENGINEERS\nELECTRONIC ENGINEERS\nMATHEMATICIANS\nare required as:\n, SENIOR SCIENTIFIC OFFICERS\nSCIENTIFIC OFFICERS\nand some\nSENIOR and JUNIOR RESEARCH FELLOWS\nFor further information consult your\nUNIVERSITY APPOINTMENTS OFFICER\nor apply to:\nSUPERINTENDENT, SCIENTIFIC PERSONNEL,\nR.

    "content": "FELIX NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION Nr. 187 WEDNESDAY,13 th FEBRUARY PRICE 4D. NUS AT LAST? By J. M. Combes\nSTORM OVER PRESIDENTS 45 SEC. ADDRESS\nThe Imperial College Union decided by a majority of 16 votes\nto join the National Union of Students forthwith at a debate last\nThursday. Main features of the three-hour meeting were brilliant\nspeaking by Finch and Stacey, followed by an irregular outburst by\nChandmal who spoke emotionally and out of turn. All present were\nsurprised when the President leapt to his feet after the debate had\nclosed and in 45 furious seconds split the solidarity of the executive\nwith an unconstitutional plea to support the motion.\nIn a historic secret ballot the tion as \" the flat earth brigade,\"\nhe farsighted ly explained that\ntheir financial arguments would\nbe dealt with later.\nN.U.S., continued Mr. Finch,\nstudent national body, and it\nexists to campaign for student\nwelfare, to focus student opinion.\nTheir views are expressed in a policy statement issued every\nyear giving the opinions of the\nmajority. He went on to give\nexamples of such policies : the\nUniversity Central Clearing\nHouse scheme, and automatic\ngrants for those who have obtained University places. At present N.U.S. is seeking abolition of\nthe means test.\nmotion was carried by 405 votes\nto 389 with 27 abstentions. The\nvalidity of this vote is perhaps\nweakened by the fact that many\neither did not stay to the end, or\ncould not get into the hall at all.\nBut the high total of votes cast\nsuggests that the unrest of the\nprevious Weeks has made the\nUnion acutely aware of the magnitude of the issue.\nFINCH PROPOSES\n25 MINUTE ORATION\nMr. Finch spoke clearly and\neffortlessly for the best part of 25\nminutes while elucidating the\ntwo points he had to make. First,\nthat i.C. ought to be paying to\nsupport a National Body of students ; second, that I.C.U. ought\nto join N.U.S. for the facilities it\noffers. Referring to the OpposiG OR DON LOWE S The ideal Sports Shop\nGOOD DISCOUNTS FOR\nALL IC MEMBERS\n21-23 Brornpton Arcade,\nKrdghtsbridge, S.W.3 KEN 4494/5/6\nA RESPONSIBLE BODY\nDISTINGUISHED\nVICE-PRESIDENTS\nN.U.S., continued Mr. Finch;,\nhas on its board many distinguished names, e.g., Sir John\nWolfenden and Sir Keith Murray\nof the University Grants Committee. He added that all three\npolitical parties and many National Committee have conferred\nextensively with N.U.S. They\nhave also submitted many carefully prepared memoranda to\nto Government bodies ; I.C. he\ncWm ed, has not and cannot do\nthis and thus can hardly claim to\nbe making itself heard. He further quoted instances of N.U.S. bringing pressure to bear on the\nGovernment by the use of representatives in the House of Commons.\n\"Can I.C. do any of this?\"\nhe asked, \" when it has neither\nstaff nor resources ; nor has it\nrepresentatives in the Houses of\nParliament ?\"\nHISTORICAL HANGOVER\nMr. Finch then dealt extensively with the travel concessions\navailable through the N.U.S.a gen cv who arrange many charter flights ; also work camps in\nEurooe. He enumerated the\nbenefits due to its members : the\nD \u00bb-ama Festival, the Observer\nM ace debating competition, and\nthe numerous and useful N.U.S. publications.\nCont. on page 4\nJ 'ACCUSE\nNo member of this Union can\nfeel either pleased or even satisfied with the outcome of the\nNUS debate last Thursday. The\nmotion, precarious and inflammable as it was, was carried\nthrough all the legitimate stages\nof a proper and formal debate\nuntil at the very last instant the\nPresident, who hitherto had\nmaintained a studied but deceitful neutrality, took into his mind\nto throw into an already close\nbalance the marginal weight of\nhis own duplicity.\nMarginal indeed it was. Merely\nsixteen votes in a total of over\neight hundred are alleged to\nclinch the case for the affiliation\nof our Union to the National\nUnion of Students. This too, the\nresult of a voting system so devised as to permit half the people\nto decide after hearing only half\nthe debate.\nAt this moment we must accept\nthe liability of weak and unprincipled direction of this\nUnion. We have no excuse for\nself-retribution. It falls to those\nwho regard as worthwhile the\nproud reputation of this Union\nthe unhappy task of preserving it\nfrom a man who has shown himself anything but trustworthy in\nhis duty. We are forced to recognise a President whose collusion\nwith a particular pressure group\nhas been neither open nor\nhonourable, and who has at-temped to perpetrate in the full\nview of the Union the exercise of\nhis own volition in a manner\nneither constitutional nor accept-able.\nM.J.

Eight\nUniversities competed. In the\nmeantime, the organisation which\nuntil recently was purely a Scottish affair, has, been greatly im-proved, and it is hoped that this\nyear more Universities will take\npart. The organisation of the\nUniversity of London Ski Club\nhas also kept up with the times,\nand we are intending to enter a far stronger first team than last\nyear, also a second team. The\nstandard of these teams depends\nupon the number of top class\nskiers at London willing to support the University. As things\nstand at present, we should have\nat least two internationals in the\nteam of sixes, as well as one or\ntwo continental county racers.\nThe arrangements are to send\nafa in ing team of seven to Scotland, leaving London on the 29th\"' 'arch, and staying in the same\nplace as last year. A further\ntrailing party of ten will leave\nfor Val d'l sere in the French Alps\non 21st March and stay there till\nearly April. Around the 5th April, the best skiers from France\ntogether with a few others with\nother training commitments will\ntravel up to Scotland to take part\nin the giant slalom and two\nspecial slaloms on the 8th and\n9th April. It is proposed to return to London on the 11th April,\ntravelling probably being by\ntrain as it is hoped to get reductions from British Railways.\nAnyone wishing to come and\ncheer on the London teams as\nwell as getting in a few days' ski-ing, is very welcome, and the\nUniversity officials will be only\ntoo glad to help with the arrange-ment s. Finally, the ICSki Club in conjunction with the UL Club is intending to send a mixed party of\n21 to Zurs, leaving 23rd March\nfor a fortnight. This will be primarily a social party in Austria's top skiing country, the Arlberg.\nThere are only a limited number\nof places left, so anyone interested should get in touch with the\norganisers as soon as possible.\nThe people to contact at IC\nabout any of the above are Colin\nWilliams. President IC Ski Club\n(Int. 2533) and Andy Kisiel vice-President, UL Ski Club (Int.\n2611).\nBadminton\nThe term began with the Club's yearly acknowledgement of cul-ture, in the form of a dinner and\ntheatre outing. After a dinner in\nsomewhat spartan conditions, a last minute dash to \" Beyond the\nFringe\" was made, resulting in\nabout half of us missing the\npuzzled audience reaction to the\nNational Anthem.\nAs regards our more mundane\nactivities, the first team go marching on with cons u mate ease, beating Battersea 7-2, but ironically\nChris Harvey and Dennis Forster\nlost their three-year unbeaten re-cord, which was praised in these\ncolumns last term. Last week,\nthey summarily dismissed West\nHam. another all Malayan com-bi nation, with an 8\u2014-1 victory.\nAfter being balked of matches\nlast term through cancellations\nand postponement, the Ladies\nmarshalled their best team for\nthe annual battle with UC, but\nunfortunately, the result was a6 \u20143 defeat, though this was\nmore of a cliffhanger than th\u00bb\nnumbers imply. The Men's second team continue their enigmatic performance, enigmatic in\nso far as results are disappointing,\nalthough the team is stronger\nthan in previous years. Since the\nwin over LSE I last term, they\n*>ave lost against UCI6 \u20143, aid\nQMC 8\u20141. In the former, Lim\nand Raman played well, winning\ntwo, but they were not available\nfor the latter match, while R. Clements gave a solid perform-ance. Both matches were marathon five-hour affairs, due to\nthere being only one court avail-able, the match against QMC\nbeing more of an exercise in\nkeeping warm. It was played in\na converted barn, aptly called\n\" the Hut\" by the resident Boy\nScouts, and matches were punctuated by the sound of parts of\nthe roof falling down.\nThe meagre ness of club days at\nNine Elms is recognised, and\nextra courts have been booked ;\nit is hoped that full use will be\nmade of them. Finally, the Club\nSingles tournament will be held\non Wednesday, February 13th, and this will give an opportunity\nto at least one dissident who at\nthe moment complains of the preponderance of doubles play.\nJ.

S task is to keep the\nArmy's mechanical, electrical, electronic and aeronautical equipment operational at all times. With your\nskilled soldiers, you must be able to maintain equipment,\nranging from vehicles, tanks and guns to guided wea-pons, light aircraft and radar. You could also play an\nimportant part in influencing the design of weapons and\nequipment. After specialised training, you will be\nrequired to work at home or overseas and often with\nfighting troops. You will, therefore, need to be self-reliant as well as a good engineer. You will have a vital\nresponsibility at an early age for men and equipment,\nand the varied experience you gain will be fully recognised by the major Engineering- Institutions.\nThis is how you can enter. There are two methods: a Short Service or Permanent Regular Commission.\nShort Service Commissions. To qualify for a Short Service\nCommission, you need a Higher National Certificate or\nits equivalent and should be1 'between 20 and 25. During\nyour service (minimum three years), you would be\nbuilding up a tax-free gratuity at the rate of \u00a3155 a year.\nShould you decide to make the Army your career, there\nare opportunities, providing you are qualified, to convert\nto a Permanent Regular Commission.\nRegular Commissions. To qualify for a Regular Commission, you must be between 20 and 27, have a Degree in Engineering or Physics, or be qualified for Graduate\nMembership of the Institutions of Electrical or Mechanical Engineers. When assessing seniority, account will\nbe taken of any suitable civilian engineering experience\nyou may have had. By27 you would be a Captain and\nearning \u00a31,500 a year, if married. If you were to retire\nafter only 16 years, you would get a life pension of \u00a3500\np.a. and a \u00a31,500 tax-free gratuity. Pensions and gratuities increase proportionately to a maximum after 34\nyears' service.

Can it be at\nthe Saturday Hop(e)?I have been told of a continental University whose Student\nUnion produces a neatly bound\nsheaf of printed notes, based on\nlecturer's notes, for every course.\nThese the students can purchase,\nand thus enables them to concentrate more on what the lecturer is\nsaying and therefore understand\nit better. There are dangers in\nthis, of course, but basically it is\na good idea. The University itself should do this, but since it\ndoesn't the students do it them-selves. Is this too big for I.C.? There are a great number of\nthings that could be done to improve this Union considerably\nbefore we can sit smugly back\nand say, \" We've got the best\nUnion in the country.\" Comparisons are useless unless you compare what you are, with what you\ncould be. I intend to experiment\nwith these and other ideas in\nR.C.S. Union to see how much\ncan be done, and find just how it\ncould be extended to I.C. Union\nitself.\nThat is why, for me, the question of joining or not joining\nNUS is rather ridiculous. Charity\nbegins at home, and we have so\nmuch more to do here. It's rather\nlike proposing to build a spaceship when you haven't yet learned\nto build a house. Even if we\ndo get some extra concessions,\nwhy sell your bread and butter to\nbuy jam to put on it ?\nBut that's for the Union to de-cide. As far as I'm concerned\nbuilding should take its logical\ncourse and start at the foundations.( Maybe that's what is\nwrong with South Side). , And\nthat means we should start improving this Union, because sure\nas hell, nobody else will.\nM. HARRIS.\nIF MUSIC BE THE FOOD OF\nLOVE . . ,\nWe're afraid you will have to\nmake your own arrangements\nabout the love, but the food and\nthe music will both be provided\nat the CARNIVAL LUNCHES,\nto be held this term. For 2/6 you\nare provided with cheese rolls and\nthe I.C. Jazz Band. (You are\nrecommended to eat the rolls and\nlisten to the band rather than\nvice-versa). Many of the College's Top People will be attending these lunches ; so if you want\nto be seen in the best of circles,\ngo to the Carnival Lunches!\nIn connection with these\nlunches, we should like someone\nto help out as Assistant Carnival\nLunch Organizer. This is an interesting job with many perks\n(including of course free cheese\nrolls). If you fancy yourself as\na budding Charles Forte, please\nlet the Carnival Office know.\nCOMMANDOES\nJudging by the response to\nappeals for commandoes, there\nare large numbers of I.C. men\ninterested in doing something\ndifferent and exciting at Carnival\ntime. Will all those who have\nalready volunteered please note\nthat there will be a Council of\nWar in Committee Room A next\nTuesday (February 19th) at 1.30\np.m. So please attend, all would-be commandoes\u2014and leave your\nbayonets outside!\nSTYNX\nSTYNX is still short of original\nstories by I.C. students\u2014STYNX\nis YOUR Carnival Magazine, so\nhie ye to your garret, men of I.C., and write ! Stories are needed\nmost, but jokes and cartoons\nwould also be very gratefully received by the Editor.\nOVERALL TICKETS\nOne product of the questionnaire\u2014which has provided some\ninteresting information about\nyour views on Carnival\u2014was the\nsuggestion that Carnival Tickets\nbe sold which admit the holder\nto all Carnival Events\u2014Films,\nBat BQ, International Evening,\netc.\u2014at reduced prices. This\nwill save us work and save you\nmoney, so look out for the tickets\nwhen they come on sale. And to\nthe person who suggested the\nidea\u2014thank you !\nQUESTIONNAIRE\nWhile on the subject of the\nquestionnaire\u2014the response has\nbeen fair, but only fair. There\nare still some questionnaires\nlying about the place, so\u2014if you\nhaven't filled one in yet\u2014please\ndo, and return it to the Carnival\nor Union Office. We should also\nlike to apologise for the fact that\nthe questionnaires were not in all\ncases distributed with Felix.\nEXTRA ATTRACTION ! ! !\nIf the present weather conditions permit\u2014as seems extremely\nlikely\u2014then a new feature of\nCarnival activities will be a Grand Skiing Competition. The\nexact form has yet to be decided\n\u2014some prefer a grand slalom\ndown Hampstead Heath, others\nfavour a ski run built on to the\nElec. Engl. High Block. We will\nkeep you posted, but in the meanwhile we suggest you keep your\nski is ready for action.\nP.S. \u2014Any volunteers to form\na First Aid Club ?\nPRIZES\nIt has been decided to award a prize for the best float at the procession and the best staff. Though\nwe of course realize that people\nwill in any case give generously\nof their time and effort with no\nthought of material reward\n(moral blackmail, they call that)\nthe prizes will, we hope, be a further spur to the efforts of float\nand stall builders. If this kind of\nthing interests you (stall building,\nthat is, not moral blackmail\u2014you\ncan leave the latter to us !) let the\nCarnival office know.\n.MALL AD!\nPirates of Penzance\u2014buy now\nTickets only 2/6, 3/6, 5/-.\nFOR SALE \u2014 fair scooter,\n150cc Lambretta \u00a315\nG.B. White, 59 New Hostel\nA career\nis what it's If you divide the population into two groups \u2014those\nwho take THE TIMES and those who don't \u2014 you find\nthis: those who don't take THE TIMES are in the great\nmajority. Those who do are either at the top in their\ncareers, or are confidently headed there.\nTHE TIMES both by its seniority in experience and\nby its incomparable prowess as a modern newspaper,\nnaturally commends itself to successful people. There\nis no high level conference, no board meeting, no top\nexecutive's private office into which THE TIMES is\nnot apt to be taken.\nThis choice of a newspaper by people who get on is\nindisputable.* In which of the two groups do you place yourself?\nRead\nTHE TIMES\n* STUDENTS AND THE TIMES: As a student\nyou can have The Times for 2\u00a3d.
