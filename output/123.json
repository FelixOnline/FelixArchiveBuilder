    "content": "2 FELIX PROFILE\nLC WA. PRESIDENT GILLIAN\nTILDEN-SMITH\nA Cockney by birth, and proud of\nit, GUI was without hair until the age\nof two, a precedent set by a past\nPresident. She has had a varied\no sore or from Convent School to Paris,\nthe Northern Poly and at last to I.e., we doubt if the circle will be completed\nin the cloistered solemnity of a nunnery.\nAlthough Gillis perhaps best\nknown in the field of sport for her\ncricket, having organised the famous\nI.C. W.A.v.1 st XL match, she also\nplays tennis, table tennis and badminton and is an active member of the\nunder Water Club, even having been seen\non wet days practising with her flip pen in the quad.\nA Botanical genius, she took part\nin last summers expedition to Norway,\nwhere a wet 6 weeks must have been\nconsiderably enlivened by her high\nspirits and ever present sense of humour wh i oh prevailed even when washed\nout of her tent on the first night and\nlater persuaded to vacate it in the\nearly hours of the morning by an inquisitive horse.\nHON. SECRETARY JOHN BELL\nThere is no truth in the rumour\nthat John was e leo ted Secretary of the\nUnion because he was the only candidate\nable to speak to the President on his\nown level. Born under Pisces in 1935\nJohn has, paro do xi call y,a very dry\nsense of humour which never leaves him,\neven when watering policemen from the\nheights of the Guilds building.\nA product of Birkenhead School,\nhe graduated from the lie ch. Eng. Dept.\nin 1957 end provided the excuse-for continuing his Union activities by becoming\na fatigue expert - at least he is the\nonly person in the Hostel who appreciates the true relations hio between\nstresses and strains on a loga rhythm ie basis.\nGill's interests are not confined\nto I.C. but extend in other directions\nalso. She has travelled extensively\nand speaks several languages fluently,\nas well as being able to make herself\nunderstood in a limited, though im-port ant, field of social life in many\nothers.\nGill has strong views on the part\nw hio hI. C.W. A. should play in college\nlife which she divulged during an early\ninterview the morning after a party,\nbetween sips of black coffee. (Pause\nto extract wasp from the room with\nsimultaneous loss of Gill to the depths\nof her bed and one correspondent up\nthe wall).\nCn reappearing Gill told us that\nshe thinks small groups of women o an do more good than large ones, that\nfeminine influence on oom mitte es is a good thing and that $ post grads are\ninsufficiently brought into oo lle ge life. Gills ambitions are modest,\nwants to:\nShe\n1) Visit every capital in the world.\n2) Marry a multi-millionaire.\n3) Ply Mr. Garnett's pyjamas from the\nflag pole.\n(4) Write a book on the i dio sync rac ies of carrots.\nWe left her happily crunching one\"\nand declaring that \"she can't be\nbothered to lead a sordid life it's too exhausting\".\nA glance at his room in the Hostel is very revealing: the first thing\nthat strikes the visitor is that room\n58 is bigger and better thai all the\nothers and it come3 as no surprise to\nfind that John chose it himself. Sporting activities are apparent from the\nwell-used squash racquet, the hockey\nboots in a tidy heap on the floor, and\nthe copiously autographed plate which\nhangs on the wall. This plate is a souvenir of a disgusting orgy which\nmarked the end of a tour of Holland\nlast year. John is now Captain of\nHookey and it is notable that his election coincides with an unprecedented\nsurge of enthusiasm for the sport by\nI. C.W. A. Some say that his popularity with\nwomen is connected with the blood-stain-ed whip which is also part of the decor*\nbut we feel that this would be quite\nout of character for John. It is more\nlikely that the woman in his life actually uses is* on him. Her softening\ninfluence is apparent elsewhere in the\nroom, notably in the art-prints on the\nwalls, and in the strange new, books on\nthe shelf. Just above them stands the\ntankards wh i oh are evidence of John's successive ser vio e as Secretary and\nChairman of S. C.C. vin previous years.\nPeople who devote much of their\ntime to running the Union are often\nseen dashing about in their efforts to\ncope with the job,'but this is not so\nwith John. The curious thing is that\nhe never appears to do any work, and\nthis is clearly a sign of great ef-fic ien cy. MOUNTAINEERS IN ALPS This summer, ten members of the\nClub, assembled by devious means in Cortina. d 'Ampezzo to climb in the Dolomites. With no previous experience\nof the region, the short routes offered\nby the Cinque Torri were selected as an\nintroduction to the area, and several\nfine, exposed climbs were had by all parties.\nSpurred on by this taste of\ndolomite climbing, nine members of the\nparty reassembled at the Cimo di Lavarado to attempt a series of mare extended and ambitious routes, the tenth\nmember remaining in Cortina to effect\nrepairs to a back axle. Amongst\ntheir e limbs, including the 1,400 feet\nnorth east corner of the Cime Grande,\ntwo parties climbed an excellent very\nsevere route on the Piooolissima.\nThe o amp was now moved to the Passo\ndi Sella and a great deal of fine steep\nclimbing was dons on the Cinque Dita\nand the Sella and Vaiolet Towers. Our\nstay in the Dolomites terminated with\na riotous dinner at the Refugio di Sella.\nAgreeing to reassemble in Zermatt,\nfour members drove to Venice to facilitate car repairs, while en route for\nZermatt, two others in a blue sports oar\nhad a slight disagreement with a stationary Mercedes. Minus wing and with\nbent front axle, driver and a somewhat\nshattered President miraculously appeared\nin Zermatt some days later.\nIn spite of the changeable weather,\ngood snow and ice climbing was had on\nthe Dom, Monte Rosa, Nordend, and Pelixjooh, when one weighty member tested\nhis partner's skill by jumping into\na six feet wide crevasse. Recovering\ntheir composure, he was duly hauled out.\nThe weather showing signs of det-eri oration, four members walked from\nthe Monte Rosea to the HBrnli hut, hoping to climb the Matterhorn. Their\nhopes were crushed, however, by a heavy overnight snow fall and it was\ndecided to end the meet in view of the\nweather and dwindling finances.\nIt was generally agreed that a highly successful summer meet had been\nheld considering the fact that five\nmembers had no previous alpine exp erie no e. During the course of these four\nweeks,numerous colour photographs were\ntaken and it is in ten ede d to show a selection of these in the near future\nfor the benefit of anyone interested.\nInformation regarding this will be\nposted on the Mountaineering Club Notice\nBoard.\nJ.

Piokinson voiced the opinion of I. C.W. A. by issuing an early ultimatum, \" If they\nwant their socks darned, they must learn -to do it themselves!\"\nTalking of holes reminds me of the\ncavity wh i oh has recently appeared in a wall near to the serving hatch in the .Lower Refectory. Soon the alteration will be completed and a new door\nfitted, but be careful ' all ye that enter\nthere-in\" for it only leads to the\nwashing-up room! At last something\nhas been done to speed up the removal\nof dirty crockery.\nWhen not playing his violin Mr.\nMcDowell is to be found in his office\nat the top of the Registry busily arranging the oo lle ge 'General Studies'.\nLast Thursday lunch-time he started off\nthe term with a bang. The two lectures\n(sex and crime) were wall attended (No\ncomment). Sir Roderio Hill started\nGeneral Studies in1952, and he appointed\nMr. McDowell as organiser who has admirably held the reins ever since. Be\nis at all, quiet and efficient men, fs nd of music, reading and walking. He has\nthe interests of a wider education for\nstudents at I.C. very much at heart,\nand is worried that students sometimes\nwrongly regard General Studies ss imposed culture. Lest week he told me\nthat many of the ideas for lectures\ncome from students and student societ-ies. So if anyone has any ideas for\nlunch-time lectures or lecturers, if they contact Mr. MoDowall they will find\na most open-minded and appreciative listener. Frequenters of the Snack Bar\n(next to the Union arch-way) have been\ntesting the new wicker furniture.\nNo doubt many more students will now\nbe able to s it down for coffee at the\nstrictly regimented lines of tables and\nchairs, but I cannot help feeling a little nostalgia for the mare homely\natmosphere of the bays of shiny leather\nsettees, where one could lounge and\nlinger over a cup of coffee.\nEarly last Saturday morning as I was crossing the Quad, I saw three very\npretty girls who were obviously in dis-tress. They could not find Room 110\nin the hostel. Crowds of errant males\nappeared from all over, hastening to\nlead the way. One frustrate:! male\nenviously wondered who was the lucky\nfellow in110 who was having so many\nbeautiful visitors so early in the day.\nOn consulting the resident list he\nfound that the occupant was Miss Susan\nCoombs! - it a mej THE FAIR SEX TRIUMPHS\nTony \"Freedom from Women\" Hodgson, past Editor of Phoenix, has sacrificed his strong pri no ip les by becoming\nengaged to a pretty frau le in in the record time of 3? weeks. He is further\nengaged - in research work at one of\nthe lesser-known Universities, where\nhe devotes some little time to the pursuit of his kind of music: he is now\nleading clarinetist of a professional\ngroup there.\nHe is also writing a sequel to his scathing article to be entitled:\n\"Freedom from Women - But!\"\nTHE EXPLORATION SOCIETY Since as many as three expeditions\na year are now being sent to foreign\nparts from this oo lle ge, it was thought\nlast year, that the formation of an\nExploration Society would help to\nbring together the people interested in\nthis kind of thing. The so oie ty now\nex s is ts, and this term will be sponsoring a series of talks by prominent\nexplorers. It is hoped to show several films, some of them in conjunction with the Film Society and to\narrange slide shows of this year's expeditions.\nIt is not intended that the so oie ty will officially sponsor expeditions and\nthe committee organise them. This\nwill be left to the individuals in the\nso oie ty and oo lle ge. It is hoped that\nthe so oie ty might serve a useful function as a meeting pla oe of have been\nand would be explorers. It is hoped\nthat people proposing expeditions to the\nExploration Board (which is a College\nbody and ex s is ts only to finance and\nequip expeditions) will first of all submit them to the so oie ty, so that the\nproposer s might receive advice and get\nthe necessary oo pies of the proposal\ntyped out. In this way the secretary\nof the Exploration Board will be saved\nundue work in the duplication of the\nnecessary numbers of oo pies of the proposal and the proposer s themselves put\nin a more favourable position since the\nproposal will then be presented in the\ncorrect form.\nPS.\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE COMMEMORATION DAY Royal Albert Hall\nThursday, 23rd October, 1958\nSPECIAL VISITOR> WERTH ON THE LORD BRIDGES, PC, GCB, GCV.Q, MC., FRS.\nGHANA \"REFRIGERATORS AND MUD HUTS\"\nOn July 16th, the seo on d Natural\nHistory Society Expedition to Ghana set\nsail, after some doubts and setbacks,\nto continue their long term study of\nvegetation decay under tropical conditions. Under their leader. Bob Sturrook,\nthe party of 6 zoologists and two botanists settled in the Bobirir Forest\nsome 25 miles from the town of Kumasi.\nCommunications were maintained by\ntruck, wh i oh also took the expedition\ninto the town for a \"quiet\" weekend;\ncelebrations of one sort or another\nformed a large part of the party's activities.\nThe main impression of Ghana-was\none of contrasts of extreme poverty\nand wealth, of advanced technology and\nstartling squalor. A deep impression\nwas made on the expedition by the \"High\nLife\" dances, some members watching the\ndancers with distinctly un-a oo logi o al eyes!\nPassage complications forced the\nparty to split up on September 11th; two sailed on the 12th and a further 3\non the 15th. The remaining 2, the\nleader Bob Sturrook and John Webster,\ntravelled by truck to the Northern\nTerritories, looking far the snail\nbarriers of the tropical blood disease\n[called Bilharzia. This part of the\ncountry was very obviously poorer and\nmore primitive than the base area, the\nmen still oar r ying bows and poisoned\narrows. Finally, the last remaining\nmember set sail on Sept. 24th for England and exp eot to arrive here on the\n15th of October.\nTo disillusion those who imagine\nthat the party had a glorious sun-bathe, only 10 sunny days were enjoyed\nin the entire 6 weeks' stay; Ghana\noo pies the U.K. in many ways - even the\nweather.\nThis year the Rover Crew expedition was staged in Andorra, the pinprick on the French-Spanish border,\ncamping 6 Km from Sant Julia de Sarin\nin the vicinity of a farmhouse and\n1400 ft. above the town.\nThe rugged country is little known and often the existing maps are\nin error, which caused the crew to pioneer its own routes on many occasions.\nIn general, the rock is rotten, probably due to the extremes of temperature\nbetween day and night. An massing\nvariety of plants is to be found >\ndespite rooks and dima tio conditions,\nand one member alone pressed 260 spec-ies.\nThe crew arrived some time before\nthe tourist rush started and soon became well known among villagers. Dai\nly visits to the wine shop in Sant\nJulia made the crew popular with the\nproprietor concerned, while the local\ngoat skin wine bottles provided much\nentertainment to those not using them.\nG.P.

    "content": "FELIX s LETTERS THE NEEDLE\nDear Sir,\nI really was appalled by the self-o on so io os tripe appearing over the name\nof one \"Cleopatra\" in your last issue.\nThe propagation of such an adolescent\napproach to the fact a of I.C. life can\nhardly be expected to engender anything but distrust between the f re ah men and woe en, and I fear that this be\nthe writer's aim.\nHaving erected a hypothetical barr i er of indifference (manifesting Itself\nin rather unusual ways - \"Women are to\nbe feared, avoided and ignored\"), she self\no on so i ou sly examines ways of breaking\nit down. A woman should not attempt\nto be \"friendly\", yet she should not\nleave others \"To make the first step\".\nWhy, why, why, why cannot these women\nsimply behave in a natural, normal,\nf \u2014 ^ \" in\" manner? Perhaps it is unfair\nof me to attack them for being immature.\nIt is hardly their fault. But the fact\nis that the majority of I.C. women\nim totally devoid in behaviour and outlook of any semblance of mature fem-in in it y, as is evidenced by Cleopatra's article. Should further proof be\nneeded, let any man venture up to the\nthird floor of the new hostel, and wat oh the young ladies thumping gracefully up\nand down the corridor to answer the tele-phone. No wonder men get drunk and are\nsio kin the quad.\nOne further point that Cleopatra\nhas missed is this. Many men have\nbeen to \"boys only\" schools: the\ntransition to a college with one woman\nto forty men is relatively painless.\nFor a woman, on the other hand, to be\nsuddenly planted at I.C. may well be a terrifying experience, and some feeling\nof being \"hemmed-in\" is perhaps in ev it able. Cleopatra should devote her\nefforts to dispelling this, instead of\nattempting to rally her girls beneath\nher crusading banner. Or are we back\nat Soedean now?\nSafety from the s cree oh ing horde\nlies in anonymity.\nYours from behind my barrier,\nPtolemy.\nIN DEFENCE\nDear Sir,\nMany people appear to have misinterpreted the spirit in wh i oh my\narticle was written. It was intended\nto bring into the open a problem to\nwh i oh many members of the college -both men and women - feel there should\nbe some solution. A vitriolic attack\nsuch as the above letter does nothing\nto help. It is agreed that the situation mentioned in the last paragraph\nexists but the men should realise that\ntheirs is the opportunity to help\nremedy this.\na, small body of woman in\nsuch a large college is bound to excite\ncriticism and continual criticism in spires self-consciousness. \"A lady\nis one who is treated as such\" but\nperhaps the large number of men who\nstill behave as overgrown schoolboys\nare Incapable of appreciating this.\nMaturity includes a depth of understand-ing, so obviously lacking in the wr i ter, and would produce the constructive\nor it io is m for w hio hI hoped. I would\nbe delighted if 'Ptolemy* would discard\nhis convictions and discuss this problem openly.\nYours very sincerely,\nGillian Tilden-Smith\n(President I. C.W. A.) WHITHER FAUNA ?\nDear Sir,I beg space in your columns to\nremind inmates of the petrified \"BOT-ANY\" buildings that there is more to I.C. than just their own departments. New\nstudents, not yet stunted by departmental traditions can ( if they wish) inherit\nthe dusty gloom that waits for them.\nThey can, if they make an effort, remind the rest of the College that they\nexist.\nOne major complaint voiced by the\nsaid inmates concerns the Natural History Soc., in danger of becoming little more than an egg-headed extension of the\nday's work. It's supposed to promote\n\"social\" intercourse. Well, it's up\nto its members to see that it does and\ndo something about supporting the\nrumoured dances,darts matches, informal discussions at The Queens,etc. If this slice of R.C.S. fades into obliVion it will be its own fault.\nYours,\nSigmund Aagonschmidt\nTHE DODGERS\nDear Sir,\nOctober l st for students is like\nJanuary.l st for other people. It is\nthe beginning of a new year when resolutions are traditionally made.\nI wonder if I could influence\nyou or your readers at this stage?\nBriefly and simply it is this. Could\nwe have less of the National Servioe\ndodging-type of letter. Last year, if I remember o or rect ly, this was one of\nthe main topics aired in your correspondence column, usually, it would ap-pear, by people who were afraid to spend\na horrible, rough, nasty two years away\nfrom Mum. A great many students who\nread your paper de oid ed to serve their\ncountry first and attend college after-wards. They, at least, are not plagued\nby thoughts of avoiding National Service\nand the uneasy consciences that go with\nthem: they are therefore not at all impressed by these letters.\nI hope that this letter is one\nof only a few published on this subject during the next ten months. If Ithe students take a real interest in your excellent newspaper you will have\nenough correspondence to replace this\ndreary matter altogether.\nYours faithfully,\n\"SENEX MILES\"\nEnraged by his recent Profile,\nChubby Garnett has taken to running\nto Hyde Park. What he does when he\ngets there is no-body's business but\nhis own.\nOn seeing our pet lecher at the recent Hop, one Bedford Fresher gasped\n\"My Mummy didn't warn me about things\nlike this\"\nWhy warn 'em, let '\nem find out for\nthemselves.\n'The latest be trouser ed weekend line\nin I. C.W. A. Presidents (c.f. Cleo's Needle) provokes more than the usual\nbarr i age of derision. Rumours that\nChubby is going to retaliate by\nwearing a weekend kilt are unfounded\nas he says that his legs are not\nsexy enough.\nO Have you noticed how short the present generation of Union Officials\nNELSON is?

    "content": "FELIX3 ICELANDIC EXPEDITION The party, comprising seven I.C. students and tiro members of the staff,\narrived in Reykjavik, the capital, on\nthe 26th June. Moat of tha party\nthen proceeded to take the bus for the\n45O Kms to Akureyi, situated on the\nnorth oo a st of the island,while the\nsixteen packing oases, accompanied by\none member of the party and two very\npretty Icelandic girls, followed by\nlorry late on the Saturday evening.\nBase camp was established at Reydarfjordur, and after a coffee party with\na local fisherman, surveying began a few days later. Meanwhile, the two\ngeologists followed in a van, and after\na somewhat incredible Journey, during\nwh icL time they lost much of their kit along a hundred mile stretch of road\n(fortunately later returned to the\nAkureyi Police by a following driver),\neventually arrived nearly two weeks after\nthe establishment of Base camp, having\nenjoyed themselves immensely!\nThe expedition now split up for the\nserious work of the expedition, the geologists going south to start their map-ping, one surveying party moving to a more northerly fjord to do a survey of\nthe raised beaches and make some tidal\nobservations, while the second survey\nparty stayed at Base to undertake simi lar work.\nTransport and communication in this\nrugged fjord oo un try proved difficult\nbetween the parties, resulting in three\nsurveyors making a bao kb reeking trek\ncarrying 60 lbs of equipment each, for\nover two weeks.\nEarly in August, five of the\nparty took a coastal boat south, towards the glaciers and ioe sheets,\nwith the intention of doing a survey of\na \u00bbi \u00bb\u00bbn ice cap. Ten vary cold days\nwere subsequently spent (on an exposed\nrocky ledge) close to the edge of the\nioe, during wh i oh time the party waa\ntent bound for 5 days due to mist,\nrain, snow and sleet. Owing to the\nmist, much compass tre king was necessary,\na tricky business when the rooks of\nthe area affect the stability of the\noo a pas B, The weather finally did its worst, when a tent surrendered to the\nwind, rewarding its occupants with some\nfour gallons of icy o old water.\nIn contrast to this, the last few\ndays of our stay, when the fishing\ndispute was in full swing, was spent\nin the excellent hospitality of our\nhosts, wh i oh was so characteristic of\nthe inhabitants of this windswept\n\"Bastion of the North\".\nINDEPENDENT OPINION Are most students, especially Freshers, aware of the character of the\nthree Carnivals run during the course\nof the year by the constituent college\nunions? Briefly, these affairs\"are\nmarked by exhibitions of drunken ess and pornography to such a degree that\nwould lead, were they to take place in\na night-club or place of public enter-tain ment, to instant closure and prosecution by the police. The decor a dop, ted at every Carnival has one theme\nonly, illicit sex, and each of the three\nbodies responsible for organising these\nso-called revels seems to attempt to\noutdo its rivals in the exhibition of\never smuttier cartoons.\nCabarets demand a section to them-selves, consisting of a succession of\ndreary, unmusical, un talented ani grossly under-rehearsed sketches, oft\u2014i proceeded by mass singing of a ty. e usually confined to the Offioera' *\"oss\nor the p avil lions of the more obscure\nrugby clubs after the 4th XV's only home\nwin of the season. The rise of the\ncurtain is accompanied by derisive\nshouts and often bottles, glasses and\nfood from the sub-nutritive buffet are\nhurled at the performers: were only\nthe performers hit, nothing would be\namiss, but the stage and the proscenium arch are sometimes damaged.\ncLEOPATRA I. C.W. A. Guide to the Autuan Trends\nFor the guidance of newcomers and\nold stage rs who wish to keep up with the\ntimes, FELIX has asked his fashion\ncorrespondent to report on what the\nwell-dressed man-about-I.C. will be\nwearing *his session.\nIn probable anticipation, of a cold winter, face-covers have become\nfashion news this year. Several new\nstyles have been brought bank from the\ncontinent, some small and pointed, others\nclose-fitting and curly. With careful\ntrimming these leave the eyes quite free\nand allow full movement to the nose.\nThey usually come in brown or black but\na pale straw colour which was popular\nlast year does not seem to be so much\nin vogue this season.\nHair has been worn short during the\nsummer but with the decrease in temperature and funds I can confidently fore-oas t that it will grow. This new\nlonger style may be difficult to manage\nbut if you follow our Special Easy 3-Minute Beauty Plan (apply box 3907\nenclosing 5/- Postal Order) you will see a new, exciting lustre in your easy-to-manage hair you have never noticed\nbefore.\nThe very latest thing in Presidents\nnow is the short, wide look. The decrease in length is of course more than\nbalanced by an emphasis on quality of\nmaterial but to carry off this new line\nyou must take especial care to develop\nthe piercing eye. Everyone will love\nthis new, oh-so-o hubby, fashion.\nSurprisingly, women are brought to\nthese Carnivals but,to my knowledge,\nseldom does a girl return a second time.\nThey are not the kind of evening's entertainment to which anyone would\nbring his sister. It is evident that\nthe sole reason for taking a partner is\nthe hope that, in the atmosphere of\nimmorality with which she is surrounded\nshe may be contaminated and thus induced, with the assistance of gin, to\nbehave in a degraded fashion.\nThat the Union should tolerate such\nexhibitions, with the resultant damage to property and morals that ensues,\nis surprising.\nD.L. CLUB DANCES\nWould the Secretaries of Clubs\nwho wish to run a Saturday night informal dance please make their applications\nto the Entertainments Committee as soon\nas possible, with the date preferred.\nGlasses are definitely OUT this\nsession.\nAo on f ident forecast of what YOU\nwill be wearing in the cooler days ahead\nis the \"ohio-sao sweater\". Waists\nwill be lower than ever but the arms\nare usually cunningly hung from the\nshoulders and draped casually Into the\ntrouser pockets. An interesting det-ail is the cutest little fray-fringe\nwh i oh often makes its appearance about\nknee level. With this ensemble you will\nwant to wear a rainbow-gay shirt which\nfor spi ok and-span grooming absolutely\nmust be changed every week. To top\noff this cosy-bright winter outfit, a snug flannel scarf worn right up to the\neyes is an old favourite, still firmly\nin vogue.\nFinally some up-to-the-minute news\nfrom special correspondent Gamett.A must for you, our younger readers this\nsession is the pale, cleansed, fresh\nlook. This can only be attained by\ninfinite care but YOU are the only ones\nwho can wear it, and it is oh-so-worth-while.\n\n"

The overall standard of\nplay was quite high,so that competition\nfor the seven teams being run this year\nshould be very keen. The final trials\nwere held on Saturday, and in view of\nthe standard of the matches played,the\nclub looks forward optimistically to\na highly successful season.\nB.D. Joyce.\nATHLETICS. Ihe Athletics Club wishes to thank\ntwo of its past members, Les Locke and\nJohn Evans, for their services over the\nlast few years; we shall find it extremely difficult to replace them.\nLes, who is still a member of the\nCollege, has now turned professional\nfootballer, playing for Queens Park\nRangers. John, who has left the College, I believe is now earning his liv ing.\nOn behalf of the Athletics Club,\nI would like to wish you both every\nsuccess in the future.\n'A quick reminder of the clubs\nactivities*.\nMid way through this term a Winter\nRelays Competition,strongly contested\nby the London Colleges, is held, consisting of three relays and numerous\nfield events. In the latter half of\nthe spring term a few fixtures are\narranged, but the main season takes place\nduring the summer term.\nThe following training facilities\nare at present operating:\nCIRCTJIT TRAINING: All week nights\nexcept Wednesday, during the hour immediately after college, in the Union\nGymnasium. (See not ioe board for\nstarting date.)\nWEIGHT TRAINING: Tuesday and\nThursday lunch times in the gymnasium,\nor after college hours if the gy nm as i um is not in use.\nTRACK TRAINING: Every Sunday\nmorning at Hurlingham Park, Putney\nBridge. A party leaves I.C. hostel at\nabout 10.30 a.m. for 11.00 a.m. CASUAL RUNNING in Hyde Park during\nTuesday and Thursday lunch times (meet\n12.45 p.m. in the gy nm as i um changing\nroom.)\nAt Easter U.L. organise an excellent\n5 day training course at Motspur Park\nwith several leading A.A.A. coaches\npresent.\nThe Club hopes to organise an\nathletics tour in Denmark this Summer\nand anyone interested should see the\nnot ioe board.\nFinally, a reminder to all fresher s: It is important to watch the club not ioe board.\n\u2022To all Sports Clubs*\nI would be extremely grateful to\nall clubs wishing to have a report\npublished, if their reports reached\nme on Friday evening for the Wednesday's sport, and Sunday mornings, before\nmidday, for the Saturday's sport.\nSWIMMING Last year the club had a moderately\nsuccessful season. The Swimming section\nwon the University Swimming Championship because of Stirling work by the\ntwo Rogers; however the Water Polo\nsection did not do so well. The club\nhad numerical strength far three teams\nbut quality was lacking: the first team\nafter a good start, later faded because\nof insufficient training and too much\nalcohol.\nColours awarded last season.\nFull W. Corrigan, R. Larsen\nHalf R. Basham, D. Beoket, P. Hills\nWe extend a hearty welcome to our\nfresher s. It looks as if we have a good oh ance of retaining the University\nChampionship, and the Polo team with\ntraining and new recruits should doubtless improve on last seasons performance.\nWater Polo Fixtures\nFri.

Oct. 2A. th ls tv SOUTHGATE 7.30 p.m. Buckingham Palace Road.\nTENNIS IN WINTER ?\nThere is a school of thought, which\nconsiders that tennis is essentially\na summer game. For those who dis-agree, there exists aol ubin each of\nthe three constituent colleges, wh i oh has the audacity to arrange tennis\nmatches throughout the Autumn and Spring\nTerms.\nThe City and Guilds Lawn Tennis\nClub has always been able to field a strong team, beating most other London\nUniversity oo lle ges and, for the furtherance of this reputation, requires\nall Guildsmon tennis players to inspect\nthe o lub not ioe board, situ tate d in Guilds entrance hall, and attend the\npractices advertised thereon. The\npractices take place at Bishops Park\nCourts, Fulham Palace Road, S.W.6. every Wednesday afternoon, and matches\nhave been arranged for every Saturday\nmorning throughout the term. Last\nseason Guilds L.T. C. was able to field\ntwo teams of six players and, if sufficient support is forthcoming, will do so again this season.\nSo o on tin ue your enjoyment of\ntennis through the whole year and help\nto raise your own and our standard of\nplay. Balls are provided by the o lub, nylon racquets are usually necessary\nwebbed feet are an advantage.\nCROSSCOUNTRY. The Crosscountry Club has gained\nabout a dozen fresher s, and, from\nthe results of the two trials held so\nfar, several of them appear to be very\ngood. We welcome all new members, and\nhope they will enjoy running with us\nwhether in the first team or the second,\nand always, it appears, in the rain.\nTomorrow our first fixture of the\ntana is the U.C. Relay far wh i oh we\nhave entered two teams. However, a team consisting oh ie fly of postgraduates did have one race during the vaca-tion, finishing 14th in the St. Albans\nCrosscountry Relay.\nClub training will take place at\nlunchtimes on Tuesdays and Thursdays\n(meet in the changing room at 12.45 p.m.) and on Sundays at 1100 a.m. at the Hurlingham track, Putney Bridge. Circuittraining facilities will be available\nto members on Mondays and Thursdays,\n5-6 p.m. We look forward to another successful season, and hope to retain the U.L. Cup in the Championships this oo ming December.\nHOCKEY. The number of fresher s joining\nthe hockey club this year has fallen\nin comparison with last. In this\nrespect the trials have been di sap pointing, but the quality of play has\nbeen good.\nWe are rather fortunate to have\nlost very few of last year's \"old\nfaithfuls\"; in fact last year'sl st XI has lost only one player. I hope\nthis will not discourage some of the\nfresher s who may find themselves in the\n2nd XI, whereas in previous years they\nwould probably have made the l st. It is extremely difficult to\nforecast the final strength of the\nteams until after the U.L. Trials.\nLast year the o lub provided five of the\nUniversity side and should have a similar number this season. If we o an equal the record of last year, and impress on the U.L. Cup results - and\nthere is no reason why not - it will be\nan excellent year.\nWANTED:- One brave, resolute man\nas hookey goalkeeper. Armour provided.\nApply to any of the Hookey Club Committee.\nLast, but not least, we would like\nto welcome all fresher s and hope they\nhave an enjoyable season with the club.\nIMPORTANT NOTICE \u2022To all Sports Enthusiasts*\nIt is hoped each fortnight to\npublish an editorial on some controversial sporting topic. This can\nonly be done with your 00\u2014operation.\nIf you, the enthusiasts, would like to\nhelp, please place your article in the\nUnion Rack; they should then eventually\nreach me.\nPublished by FELIX BOARD -Imperial College Union S.W.7.

    "content": "FELIX7 GLIDERS VISIT CORNWALL. On Saturday July 7th, a party of\nGliding Club members left Twnham by\nroad for the Cornish Gliding Club's site at Perranparth. The party included Paul Mlnton, the leader of the\nexpedition, and Frank Irving, who had\njust returned from the World Championships at Lezno in Poland, The gliders\ntaken were the Club Skylark II \"Phoenix\"\nand a privately owned Skylark III \"Six-ty-Six\". A further Skylark II was\ntaken by a small contingent of Surrey\nGliding Club members, together with a Tiger Moth towing aircraft.\nPerranporth was reached after dark\nand the first night was spend in the\nhanger, but as no flying was possible\non the Sunday camp was struck by an old\nSpitfire disposal. Unfortunately Frank\nIrving had to return to I.C. on Sunday\nevening as he had been away in Poland\nfor a month.\nMonday was notable for the rashness\ndisplayed by a few pre-breakfast bathers\nin the nearby sea, resulting in near\nrigor mortis. Flying, but no soar-ing, was possible on the following two\ndays giving no opportunity of familia-rising members with the new site. On\nThursday Bill Tonkyn was towed inland\nin \"Sixty-Six*and, releasing near\nTruro, flew to Lostwithiel where he was\nforced to land as he had flown too far\nSouth of the lift. Several other\nmembers had tows towards Truro and contacted lift, but were not suitably\nplaced to use it. Friday was the best\nday of the week, with a light land\nbreeze and by 11 o1 clock thermals were\nobviously rising above the site itself.\nPaul Minton made the best flight of\nthe day, soaring locally for about an\nhour, then flying to Trevose Head. He\nlanded at St. Ival while returning to\nPerranparth as the sky seemed full of\nShackletons. \"Phoenix\" was also\nsoared together with a Tandem Tutor\nbelonging to the Cornish Club.\nDespite the sea-mist which prevented flying for numerous hours, and\nthe lack of a sufficiently strong sea\nbreeze the week had been a suo ces s. This was largely due to the availability of the Tiger Motht as most of the\nlaunches were by aero tow. Sincere\nthanks are due to the Surrey tug-pilot,' and to the Cornish Gliding (and\n*Plying) Club for their hospitality,\nthe use of their two-seaters, and, of\ncourse, the bar.\nCOMING EVENTS.

After a great deal of\ntime and hard work had been spent\ncleaning and preparing her (and three\nmonths oxidation on brass-work takes\nsome cleaning!), she was duly pushed out\ninto the open air to be started.\nAfter half an hour's exhaustive swinging (no mean feat when there are some\n3 litres on the other end of the handle)\nan ominous 'ol on k' was heard from 'down\nthe front underneath'. A closer inspection revealed that the supporting\nbracket for the rocker arm of the offside exhaust valve had sheared. This\nbracket o on s is ts of a short double arm,\nand it was obvious by the dirt and\ngrease that one side had been broken\nfor quite some time. The other side\nhad withstood the extra stress for as\nlong as possible, but had finally\nfractured at this rather inopportune\ntime. As this failure put the offside cylinder out of action, starting\nbecame impossible.\nAs insufficient Guildamen were\navailable to push 'Bo' to her place\nof honour in front of the Union the only\nvehicle of sufficient nobility qualified\nto tow her waa very kindly brought to\nour assistance by her keepers from\nR.C.S. The sight of a noble, but temporarily defeated, 'Bo' being towed by\na triumphant 'Jezebel' was almost aa\nawe inspiring as if the two had been\ndriven in convoy.\nA repair is being effected as soon\naa possible, and in all probability will\nbe completed by the time this reaches\nprint.\nFootnote: Anybody with an interesting\nSpecial wh i oh he wishes to submit far\na Felix road-test, please contact either\nGeoff Howard or Brian Wellstead, both\n3M, via C.A G.

Fire Engine emerged from\nher summer hibernation on Saturday, Sept.\n27th, for the second Historic Commercial\nVehicle Club rally at the ABC works,\nSouthall, the following day. Particular\nattention was paid to the brass, as it was known that she would be facing works\ncompetition. In the afternoon, she\nwas paraded round Earls Court, in company with half a dozen other vehicles,\nto publicise the event.\nAn excellent lunch and tea were\nprovided by ABC Ltd. and their chairman - Lord Brabazon - judged the\n'o on cours'. The driving tests unfortunately were curtailed considerably,\nonly a time-trial being held. However,\nwe managed to hold our own test when it was found that the fire engine, with\n11-up, made a very satisfactory standing start up a1 in7 test hill. On Sunday, she arrived at Southa ll to find a1914 Dennis and two 1928\nDennis's already present. There were\nalso a Leyland and a Ford-T based fire\nengine, all these fortunate vehicles\nbeing complete with pumps.\nThere were three steamers present,\nincluding 'The Animals' Friend' - a1903 engine used by the RSPCA to assist\nhorse-drawn vehicles up Crystal Palace\nHill. On the Freshers' Days, Jezebel was\nused to tow Bo' out to the Union and\nbao k, and performed this very satis-factor i ly. However, on her trip round\nthe Park, she was ignominiously allowed\nto run out of petrol, and had to be\npushed home, completing, as you will\nsee, the trio of not particularly mobile\nchariots.\nCLEM FOULED\nWith the rally at Southall as\nher goal, \"Clementine* duly left the\nUnion at 10.15 a.m. on Sunday 28th September with 125 p.s.i. All went smoothly until she reached\nGillette Corner, when it was discovered\nthat a sack of Anthracite instead of\nWelsh Dry Steam Coal had inadvertently\nentered her grate, and effectively\nkilled the fire. Then, after a five\nand a half hour delay, help arrived\nin the form of a sack of low-grade house-coal, extracted from the research lab.\nand delivered by Humber Snipe: with this\nstimulant Clem, managed to return under\nher own steam.\nThe crew, both professionally consorted with the N.C. B., have not yet-lived the blunder down!\n\n"
