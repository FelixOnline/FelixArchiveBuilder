For\nthose unaware of just\nhow badly Bethesda has\nscrewed the pooch, let me\ntake you through the troubled lifetime of Fallout\n76.\nSo firstly, the game\nreleases and it\u2019s a hollow\nshell of a Fallout game,\nstripped of much of its\nidentity and rushed out\nthe door in an unfinished\nstate just to make a quick\nbuck. There was no story\nto speak of, a dull and\nrepetitive grind and the\nmuch lauded player interactions were so poorly\nimplemented it showed\njust how poorly thought\nout the multiplayer\naspects were. Top it off\nwith a cash shop which\nwould happily sell you\nassets ripped straight from\nFallout 4 and you have\na game emblematic of\nwhat\u2019s wrong with triple\nA gaming; made all the\nbitterer for coming from\nBethesda, thought to be\none of the last bastions of\nconsumer friendly single\nplayer games. I reviewed\n76 overwhelmingly negatively when it released,\nand I still feel like I went\neasy on it.And it was here,\nright as the game released,\nthat the controversies\nbegun.\nThe release itself got\noff to a bad start. The\nbeta was little more\nthan early access. They\nchanged almost nothing\nafterwards, and didn\u2019t\neven wipe progress when\nit ended. It was just a ploy\nto drive pre-orders, and\nthat\u2019s a classic red flag.\nThis \u201cbeta\u201d experienced\nthe strangest bug I\u2019ve\nheard of in a long time,\nwith the game randomly\nuninstalling when closed.\nThis is a 46 GB game\nfile that would then need\nto be re-downloaded.\nBut you better hope you\ndon\u2019t have a download\ncap on your broadband\nbecause after that the day\none patch was 54 GB.\nThat\u2019s right, the patch was\nbigger than the game itself\ndespite seemingly fixing\nlittle to nothing. Finally,\nwhen fans who were quite\nrightfully feeling burned\napproached Bethesda for\na refund they were told\nthat as they had opened\nthe game they were no\nlonger entitled to one, no\nmatter their play time.\nThe conspiracy theorist in\nme says it wasn\u2019t released\non steam due to the\nnegative reviews it would\nhave gotten and the incredibly generous refund\npolicy which would have\ndecimated their profits. A\nfan base in ruins and their\nreputation on the line,\nthere would need to be a\nserious effort on their part\nweek and there is already\nnew outrage. The now\ninfamous canvas bag\nsituation. The \u201cPower\nArmour Edition\u201d (collector\u2019s edition) of the game\nwas advertised as coming\nwith, among other things,\na high quality canvas\nbag in the Fallout style.\nWhat was received was\na shoddily made nylon\nbag which looked like a\nChinese knock off you\u2019d\naccidentally buy on eBay.\nBethesda eventually\ncommitted to producing\nand delivering real bags\nto all owners, but not\nwithout stoking the fire\na bit first. For one, when\npeople started contacting\nBethesda support they\nwere told nothing was\ngoing to be done about\nit, but that they could all\nhave 500 atoms (ingame\ncurrency) as compen-sation. That\u2019s \u00a34 of\nintangible compensation\nto people who paid up to\n\u00a3200 for the collector\u2019s\nedition. It\u2019s even worse\nwhen you realise it\u2019s a\ndirect insult to their most\ndedicated fans as who else\nwould pay that much for\na game. Only once the\noutrage started to spread\nall around the gaming\nsphere did they relent.\nThis situation was exacerbated by the fact that\ninfluencers in the media\nwho were sent this edition\nto preview DID receive\na canvas bag, meaning\nBethesda made an active\ndecision to deceive its\nfans. And finally, to top\nit all off after collecting\nthe personal details of\nall those who bought the\npower armour edition\nand were due represent\nThe blissful promises made that were never fufilled // Bethesda\n\u201cA hollow shell\nof a Fallout\ngame, stripped\nof much of its\nidentity and\nrushed out\nthe door in\nan unfinished\nstate\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s time\nfor a big pull-quote. We love\nthese things,\nbut don\u2019t\nforget to make\nthem short!\u201d\nin order to fix the damage\nthat had been done.\nCut forward not even a\nbags, Bethesda leaked\ntheir personal details.\nOutstanding move.\nThing\u2019s died down for\na while and the collective\ngaming consciousness\nmoved on, with only a\nlittle murmur when it\ninexplicably went on\nblack Friday sale less\nthan 2 weeks after release.\nThat is not something that\ngames that are selling\nwell do. But focus came\nricocheting back when\nChristmas rolled around.\nUnsurprisingly for a game\nwith a cash shop, Bethesda\nadded some Christmas\nthemed cosmetics. A bit\nof a slap as it was the\nonly new content since\nrelease, but the real kicker\nwas the sleazy way they\nwere sold. Ignoring how\nexpensive they were (the\nSanta costume was \u00a315)\nfrom day one they were\n\u201con sale\u201d for a \u201cdiscounted price\u201d despite never\nactually having sold for\nthe \u201coriginal price\u201d. This\nis a flagrantly manipulative sales strategy praying\non people\u2019s desire for a\ngood deal. Best of all,\nthis is actually a practice\ncommonly used by mobile\ngames and has been used\nbefore by EA. Not a good\nlook there Bethesda.\nAs the year drew to a\nclose and the time for new\nbeginnings was upon us,\nwhat did Bethesda have\nplanned? How would they\nwin back favour with the\ncommunity? Apparently\nISSUE 1711\nFELIX\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n31\ndestroyed their reputation with a single game\n\u201cEntire\nwebsites have\nbeen created\nto sell you\nhacked and\nduped items\nso you can skip\nthe grind\u201d\n\u201cThey have\nshown that\nwhen the chips\nare down they\nare willing to\ntreat their fans\nwith contempt\n\u201d\nby paying homage to the\nY2K bug. On January first\nthe nukes broke. In 76, the\nnukes are effectively the\nendgame content. You can\nlaunch a nuke to create a\nhigh level zone in which\nto farm, as well as messing\nwith other players. It\u2019s\nunquestionably a core\nfeature and one of the\nfew saving graces of the\ngame, and with the new\nyear the system broke and\nthey couldn\u2019t be launched.\nThis wasn\u2019t even the first\ncontroversy surrounding\nthe nukes, as despite it\nsupposedly being a big\ndeal to collect launch\ncodes and fire one off, the\ncodes weren\u2019t random.\nThis meant people would\njust upload new ones to\nreddit, rendering one of\nthe core gameplay looks\nentirely unnecessary.\nThe broken nukes were\nfixed relatively fast, but it\nshows how poorly thought\nout the game was. It was\nreleased in November,\nbut they hadn\u2019t properly\nplanned even 2 months\nahead.\nBut nothing shows\nBethesda\u2019s incompetence\nlike the latest in this long\nstring of embarrassments.\nSee, the game has had a\nhacker problem from day\n1, and Bethesda having\nnever dealt with online\ngames like this before\nhave been really struggling to deal with them,\nand exploits are patched\nbut to say some hackers\nfall through the cracks\nwould be a vast under-statement. However, the\nlatest development came\nwhen enterprising hackers\nrealised they could duplicate high level items to\nsell to other players. And\njust like that, an immense\nsecond hand market\nsprung up selling perks,\ncaps and weapons to other\nplayers for real money. Go\non eBay and you can buy\nunofficial weapon packs\nfor upwards of \u00a3200.\nEntire websites have been\ncreated to sell you hacked\nand duped items so you\ncan skip the grind. It goes\nwithout saying that this\nhas entirely decimated the\ncore gameplay loop, and\nthe fact people are paying\ntheir rent by hacking a\ngame is ludicrous. It is\nnow entirely possible\nto see low level players\nhopped up on bobble-head\nperks taking on endgame\nmonsters with ease due to\nthe flood of these items\ninto the economy.\nIt doesn\u2019t even end\nthere. Long time Bethesda\nfans know their maps\nitem in the game. They\u2019re\nused for testing things\nbefore release. These\naren\u2019t places you should\nbe able to reach, but they\nleave them in their single\nplayer games because in\ntheory they do no harm,\nand are a neat easter egg\nfor those willing to dive\nthrough the game files\nand do some modding.\nHowever, in a show of\nstunning brilliance they\nleft the developer room in\nthe Fallout 76 map, and\nfinally people are getting\nin there. Obviously there\nis the issue of people\ngetting high level items\nfor free, but people have\nfound weapons and items\nin there that are not even\nlegitimately available in\nthe game, perhaps because\nthey were broken or\nbecause they were planned\nfor release in a later patch.\nThe final cherry on top of\nthis whole ordeal is that,\nwhile Bethesda was able\nto lock the accounts of all\nwho got into the developer\nroom, this lock was paired\nwith an email that offered\nto unlock the account if\nthe user responded to said\nemail with instructions\non how to perform the\nexploit. That\u2019s right,\nBethesda could see you\u2019d\nbeen in there, but couldn\u2019t\nfigure out how you did it.\nAnd finally we end up\nat the present day and\nit should be clear why\npeople have lost faith in\nBethesda. This whole\nordeal has shown how\nlittle effort actually went\ninto Fallout 76, and has\nshown that Bethesda is\nnow more than willing\nto stoop to new lows\nto follow trends in the\npursuit of greater profits.\nTheir reputation is irreparably tarnished, and\nin a short time they\u2019ve\ngone from a fan favourite\ncompany to one regarded\nwith suspicion. Fallout 76\nwas not just a bad game, it\nmade people reassess the\nway they saw Bethesda\nand their previous games.\nI find it harder to overlook\nthe flaws in Fallout 4\nafter this mess, and am\nnowhere near as excited\nfor The Elder Scrolls 6,\nbecause they have shown\nthat when the chips are\ndown they are willing\nto treat their fans with\ncontempt. For Shame.\nBethesda experiences unexpected outrage after treating their customers like walking ATM\u2019s // Netflix\nban waves do get made\n\u201cIn a show\nof stunning\nbrilliance\nthey left the\ndeveloper\nroom in the\nFallout 76\nmap, and\nfinally people\nare getting in\nthere\u201d\nusually have a \u201cdeveloper\nroom\u201d containing every\n\n"

This is\nin the same way as there\nis nothing wrong with a\nsingle influenza virus. It\nis unlikely to do any harm\nby itself. What is scary,\nhowever, is when there\nare lots of them all packed\ninto a small area such as a\ntheatre bar, be that berets\nor influenza viruses. Then\nit is time to start worrying.\nSo begins my unified\ntheory of dramatic criti-cism. Tune in next week\nfor my views on continental breakfasts.\nApproaching Empty is\na dramatization of a book\nby Ishy Din, an ex-cab\ndriver and unreformed\nplaywright, about a taxi\ncab office and the two\nfriends, Raf and Mansha,\nwho run it. When Raf\ndecides to sell the\nbusiness to a competitor,\nMansha (along with some\nfriends) scrapes together\nthe money to buy the\nplace. However, when Raf\npresents the new owners\nwith a different set of\nbooks that reveal the real\nstate of the company, the\nmen\u2019s friendship is shown\nto be not as strong as it\nappeared. The writer\u2019s\nintention was that while\nthe plot of the play affects\n\u201cRaf and Mansha\u2026\nit could quite easily\nbe Harry and Jack in a\nbackstreet garage, or June\nand Margaret in a greasy\nspoon. It\u2019s very much\nabout working class communities and the themes\ncould be applied to many\ndifferent communities and\npeoples.\u201d\nUnfortunately Din\nis less than successful\nin this. Both Raf and\nMansha are characters\nout of a children\u2019s book;\nthe slimy owner, Raf,\nwho says \u201cbusiness\u201d more\noften than Donald Trump\nand the cardigan-wearing\nMansha who likes \u201cthings\nthe way they are\u201d. This\nis a fairy tale without\nany depth, and Raf and\nMansha simply fall into\ntired old tropes of an\nevil boss and a faithful\nemployee who is cheated\nby the system.\nNowhere is this more\nevidentthanthefirstfifteen\nminutes which begin with\nnews of Margret Thatcher\u2019s death. \u201cBitch\u201d spits\nMansha. I will give Din\ncredit for something \u2013 he\nknew for whom he was\nwriting. The whole crowd\nerupts into guffaws. Raf\u2019s\nspirited defense of the\nnecessity of her policies\nplaces him firmly in the\n\u2018unsympathetic characters\u2019 category.\nAt every point there\nare glimmers of a play\nthat might have been. Din\nsays that \u201cthe universality\nof the story is that it\u2019s\nabout friendship, it\u2019s\nabout families, it\u2019s about\ncommunity, it\u2019s about\nthis effect by slicing the\nworld into goodies and\nbaddies. Why does Raf\ncheat Mansha? He does\nit because no one is using\ntaxis anymore; he is trying\nto put his son through\nuniversity and he can\u2019t\nbear to be seen to have\nfailed. These are all very\nhuman and understandable motives and yet they\nare obscured by a comic\nbook villain style goatee,\nhis shiny shoes and his\nconstant repetition of\n\u201cbeing in business means\nyou have to be heartless\u201d.\nAt one point he seems\nalmost ready to sacrifice\nhis son for his greed.\nThere are other flaws in\nthe play, too; the dialogue\nis spoken without pauses\nin between lines, making\nme, in the audience, feel\nas though I was being\nwaterboarded with words.\nI would prefer,\nhowever, to speak about\nthe positives. Sameena\n(played by Rina Fatania)\nis a fantastic breath of\nfresh air in an otherwise\nstale production. She is\na single mother recently\nout of jail on a mission to\nget her children back and\nto provide for them. She\nis convinced by Mansha\nto put the money that she\nreceives from the sale of\nher parents\u2019 house into\nbuying the taxi firm and\nis ruined when the truth\nemerges. She is criminally underutilised and I\nfind myself wondering if\nDin had expended all of\nhis creativity on writing\nher and then, having\nrun out of ideas, simply\nplugged his brain into the\nMomentum Twitter feed\nand put his pen on auto\npilot.\nThe shadow of a play\nabout the effects of de-industrialisation on the\nnorth of England is there\nin the script, but like the\npeeling and faded map\nthat takes up the whole\nback wall of the set, it is a\npathos-inducing imitation\nof the real thing.\nApproaching Empty: An unsuccessful dramatisation about a taxi cab business.\nISSUE 1711\nFELIX\n14\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nCalum Drysdale\nArts Writer\nWhere?

Then the\nshow would start, and I\u2019d\nbe absolutely stunned by\nthe mix of silly clowns,\nathletic acrobats, and\nformally-dressed directors and magicians. After\nthe show was over I\u2019d go\nhome dreaming of one\nday becoming an acrobat\nand running away with\nthe circus.\nNow imagine you\ncould step all of that\nup a notch (read: a few\ndecades) and enjoy the\ncircus in a wholly new\nand adult way. For those\nof you who have been\nliving under a rock for the\npast five years, Cirque du\nSoleil is precisely that.\nThey offer a sophisticated\nand contemporary take\non circus which suits any\naudience. The Canadian\ncircus group has actually\nbeen around since the 80s,\nbut only started picking\nup proper speed in the\n2000s. This year they are\nbringing back one of their\nshows from 2010; Totem.\nThis means time to suit up\nand get yourself over to\nour beloved Royal Albert\nHall, where you can enjoy\na glass of sparkling wine\nand a night of fantastic\n(adult) circus!\nOn Wednesday January\n16th\nat 7:30pm, it was time\nfor the premiere. Once I\u2019d\nfinally calmed my excitement and come to terms\nwith being in the same\nroom (I mean, it\u2019s a room,\ntechnically) as Prince\nHarry and Meghan, and\nto there being a blue man\ndressed like a disco ball\nhanging from the ceiling,\nI could focus on the coherence and chronology\nof the show.\nIt is a story of the origin\n\u201cA\nsophisticated\nand\ncontemporary\ntake on circus\u201d\n\u201cTotem is a\nmagnificent\nspectacle\u201d\nof mankind \u2013 the evolution\nof life from the deep sea.\nThe costumes are easily\none of the most amazing\nparts of the show, and the\nfirst act brings us back to\nthe chronological beginning of the Totem story,\nthe Palaeozoic Era, using\ncostumes inspired by real\namphibian patterns and\ncolours. The costumes\nwe get to see during the\nrest of the show draw\ninfluences from different\nAmerindian cultures,\nMayan culture, a fusion\nof Italian beach culture in\nthe 80s and Bollywood,\nextra-terrestrials, and of\ncourse a range of different\nanimals.\nTotem is not just pretty\nacrobatics and costumes\nthough; it\u2019s a full circus\nwith music, tricks and\nclowns as well. Interestingly enough, all the\npilots and space ships to\nhumans flying meters up\nin the air. Again, I think to\nmyself: today air travel is\none of the largest culprits\nof global warming, something the Wright brothers\ndidn\u2019t foresee when they\ncame up with the three-ax-is control, nor something\nNative American tribes\never dreamed of when\nthey collected feathers\nfrom the sacred bald eagle\nin awe of its freedom.\nThis speaks to me during\nthe show; the juxtaposition between then and\nnow. Does it have to mean\nsomething though, can\u2019t\nyou just sit back and enjoy\nthe show? Absolutely \u2013\nTotem is a magnificent\nspectacle anyway. I can\u2019t\nhelp but wonder about\nthis timeline juxtaposition\nthough, especially as\nthey suddenly include the\npopular Fortnite \u2018flossing\u2019\ndance in one of the acts,\na move that ties together\nthe 2010s with the Palaeozoic setting of the\nshow. \u201cFloss!\u201d a little boy\nexclaims and points at the\ndancer.\nDuring the night you\nwill get to see everything\nfrom the classic bar and\nbeams to unicycles and\ndiabolos (remember that\nthing from your child-hood?). Certain acts will\nacts leave a little to be\ndesired and can seem a bit\ncheap at times. Frequently\ninvolving the drinking of\nwine as some sort of relat-able and laughable factor,\nit undermines the beauty\nof the rest of the show.\nThe fact that there still are\nclown acts in a circus of\nthis level seems strange,\neven. Overall, however,\nthe show is thoroughly\nentertaining throughout\nand fulfils the role of a\nmore mature and adult\ncircus. Don\u2019t be as fooled\nby this as I was though.

With\n29 issues in total, that\nmeans this week's Felix\nmarks the (nearly) halfway point. You'd think\nby this point I would\nknow how to write an\nEditorial. Nope...\nThis week I found out\nthat people actually read\nthis Editorial. Someone\neven tried to make some\nsort of inside joke about\nit with me. The joke flew\nover my head. All jokes to\ndo with my Editorial will\nfly over my head because I\ndon't even know what I'm\nwriting. In future, refrain\nfrom making jokes about\nit with me. Even better,\nrefrain from reading the\nEditorial in the first place.\nThat would be great,\nthanks!\nIt's currently 9.30pm,\nwhich means it's the earliest I've ever written my\nEditorial! We edge ever\ncloser to that 7pm target.\nThis week, I also finally\ngot a book (Untold History\nof the United States by\nOliver Stone and Peter\nKuznick) and bought a\ngym membership, which\nmeans that, only 22 days\nafter my \"gym three times\na week\" and \"become\nmore well-read\" New\nYear's Resolutions, I've\nfinally got my 2019 (and\nmy life) in order. Small\nvictory but we move!\nAt 40 pages, Felix\nthis week is a bigger boi.\nIn the News, we have\nthe Union's inaugural\nLiberation & Community\nWeek. I had the pleasure\nof speaking at Monday's\nlaunch event, which was\na panel discussion. I\nmust admit it was quite\nintimidating answering\nthe question \"what have\nyou done to advocate for\nchange\", whilst sitting\nbeside people that have\ndedicated years of their\nlives to championing\ndiversity.

If you\u2019re interested, send us an email on felix@ic.ac.uk\ncome up with something\nbetter than \"I exist\"\nthough and someone even\ncomplimented me on \"my\ncontinued work as an advocate for change\". Guess\nI'm doing something right.\nIn all seriousness, the\ncontinued conversations\naround equality and diversity are necessary and I\napplaud our DPW, Becky,\nfor all the effort she put\nin to making this week a\nsuccess.\nWe also had Union\nCouncil on Tuesday\nevening, which was as\nriveting as ever. There\nwas a lot of discussion\naround name changes but\nwe did manage to spin\nquite a major story out of\none of the developments\nfrom Union.\nLast, but not least, next\nweek sees Cancer Awareness in Young People\nWeek (CAYP). This is\nreally significant and I\ncan't commend Fil and the\nIC netball team enough\nfor all their hard work.\nThey've arranged a week\nof events with the aim of\nnormalising conversations\naround cancer in young\npeople. It doesn't have to\nbe something scary that is\nonly discussed in hushed\ntone and I urge as many of\nyou as possible to engage\nwith as many of the events\nas you can next week.\nMore details can be found\non the IC Netball team's\nFacebook page.\nFinally, massive shout-out to Rhidian and Chimdi\nfor baking and keeping\nthe Felix team well fed\nthis week.

He\nalso spoke about his belief\nthat it should be perfectly\nnormal business practice\nto discuss diversity and\ninclusion and how it has\nalways been important to\nhim to push the subject\nmatter.\nThe speakers were\nasked, \u201cwhat does diversity in STEM look like?\u201d,\nto which panellist Dr. Jess\nWade (research associate\nin the Department of\nPhysics) responded, \u201cThe\nstudents at Imperial are\ndiverse but their teachers and those in senior\npositions do not reflect\nthe student make up\u201d.\nTowards the end of the\ndiscussion, the topic of\nallyship was raised:\n\u201cBeing an ally is all\nabout trying to ensure\neveryone\u2019s voice around\nyou is being elevated and\nlistened to.\u201d\nThis topic proved to\nbe an area of debate, with\nProfessor Welton admitting he doesn\u2019t \u201clike the\nterm, \u2018ally\u2019\u201d because \u201cwe\nshouldn\u2019t be applauded\nfor being supportive and\ninclusive of everyone; it\u2019s\nsomething we should be\ndoing anyways.\u201d Another\npanellist commented:\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that allyship is\nnot about speaking over\nother people, but listening to their experience\nand making sure they\u2019re\nheard.\u201d Attendees were\nalso advised on being an\neffective ally:\n\u201cSpeaking up is the\nfirst challenge. If you\u2019re\nnot knowledgeable about\nother people\u2019s challeng-es, you need to educate\nyourself and make yourself aware\u201d, shared one\npanellist, later adding,\n\u201cmake an effort to learn\nabout other people. From\nthere you can help others\nand make progress.\u201d\nThis debate led to a\nfurther question on the\ntopic of quotas, which\nalso proved to be an area\nof debate. The importance\nof everyone fully listening\nto people\u2019s experience and\nnot just focusing on hitting\nquotas when it comes to\ntackling diversity was\nstressed and one of the\nspeakers added, \u201cI think\nquotas are essential, but\nthey don\u2019t really address\nthe root issue\u201d. Another\nspeaker noted:\n\u201cEquality and equity\nneeds to be considered.\nWe all need to be treated\nfairly.\u201d\nFollowing the launch\nevent, Liberation & Community Week continued\nwith a social media cam-paign.\nThe term \"liberation\" is\ndefined as the seeking of\nequal status and freedom\nfrom all forms of oppres-sion. \u201cIt\u2019s the inclusion\nof everyone. Everyone\u2019s\nthoughts should matter.\nIt\u2019s all about listening\nand enabling people to\nspeak up\u201d, commented\none panel member at\nMonday\u2019s event.\nImperial College Union\nhas eight Liberation &\nCommunity Officers who\neach represent students\nwithin their Liberation\n& Community Zones.\nLiberation & Community\nOfficers are volunteers\nelected by the student\nbody in our Leadership\nElections.

    "content": "Fuwa Fuwa: an exact souffl\u00e9 science\nI\nf you like delicious\nflavours and something different to fill\nyour belly (and your\nInstagram feed) take a trip\nto the UK\u2019s only souffl\u00e9\npancake caf\u00e9!\nHaving first tasted these\nfluffy pieces of heaven in\nHoshino Coffee, a chain\nwith over 150 outlets\nacross Japan, I was immediately hooked! London I\nthought, renowned foodie\ndestination, was sure to\nhave somewhere for me to\nget my pancakes fix. Sure\nenough, there was one\nplace specializing in these\nsouffl\u00e9 pancakes: Fuwa\nFuwa.\nThe caf\u00e9 first set up\nshop as a pop-up in Westfield Stratford, but as I\nhadn\u2019t gotten my jabs to\nexplore so far outside of\ncentral London, I waited\na few months for its\nexpansion. Sure enough\nthey have now moved to a\nmore central location, still\nin a pop-up style, located\nat the Brunswick Centre\njust outside Russell\nSquare station. The\nsetup is very simple with\nminimal decor. Although\ncute, it does look a little\nbarren.\nHowever, being a\npop-up type setting, this\nis forgivable, especially\nsince the quality and\naesthetic of the food\nplated up more than\ncompensates. The menu\nconsists of sweet souffl\u00e9\npancakes, so if you come\nhere with anyone who\ndislikes pancakes, you\nshould probably reconsider your friendship. It takes\naround 20-30 minutes to\nmake them (unfortunately\nlonger than most places),\nso I recommend you take\nsome light entertainment\n(maybe that lecture you\nmissed because you were\ntrekking across London\nfor pancakes!)\nA bonus, however, is\nthat the cooking takes\nplace for all to see - the\nfluffiest batter is scooped\nout and placed onto the\ngriddle, and then another\nis added! That\u2019s right, to\nattain the extreme thick\nn\u2019 fluffy character, two\nscoops are stacked. The\nprecision-heated griddle\nhas an infra-red temperature sensor, used to\ndetermine if it is pancake\nready. The whole affair\nis very satisfying to\nwatch and so you should\ndefinitely film this for\nyour story, because your\n375 followers definitely\nneed to see this important\nprocess ;)\nThe menu is reasonably\npriced, slightly more\nexpensive than a hipster\nmilkshake but slightly\nless than your average\navocado toast, with the\npancakes costing between\n\u00a37.90 and \u00a38.90. The\nflavours include a honeycomb butter with whipped\ncream and syrupy\ngoodness, Banana and\nNutella (need I say more?)\nand summer fruit (fruit =\nnew year new me?). With\nso much effort put into the\npancakes themselves, the\ntoppings are surprisingly\ngood. The whipped cream\nI tried was out of this\nworld, and the yuzu cream\ncheese and blueberry\ncompote were a flavour\nmatch made in heaven.\nThe pancake itself, after\n20 minutes spent photographing it for Snapchat,\nInstagram, Facebook and\nof course LinkedIn, was\nfinally cut into.\nIt\u2019s hard to explain its\nlight and fluffy texture,\nbut let\u2019s just say that the\nNASA scientists who\nused the ultra-low-den-sity Aerogel material to\ncatch space dust should\nprobably reconsider their\nchoice. Despite their\nultra-low density, they are\nsurprisingly filling! You\nwill still probably want\nanother for the amazing\ntaste.. but let\u2019s be honest,\nyou can\u2019t afford that on a\nstudent budget.\nAll in all, highly recommended - visit Fuwa\nFuwa soon to get your\npancake fix!\nTapioca: your favourite bubble tea ingredient\nexplained!\nY\nou\u2019ve probably\nencountered, or\nat least heard\nof, tapioca at\nsome point in your life (at\nleast if you\u2019ve ever come\nclose to having boba tea\nor tapioca pudding). A\nchewy masterpiece, sometimes simply referred to as\n\u2018pearls\u2019, tapioca is in fact\na starch extracted from\nthe cassava root, a plant\noriginating from Brazil.\nConsisting almost\npurely of carbs, it is often\nused in a gluten-free diet\nas it is naturally free of\nthis compound. Sadly,\nalthough considered a\nstaple food for millions\nliving in tropical coun-tries, it has basically no\nnutritional value, protein\nor fibre, and when in the\ncommonly used black\nform, also contains brown\nsugar (so you should definitely make your bubble\ntea addiction justifications\non the health benefits of\ntea instead!).\nSo, what are the uses\nfor tapioca apart from\nbubble tea? Bread,\nflatbread, a variety of\ndesserts, or as a thickener\nfor soups and sauces are\namong the most common\n(who knew bubble tea\nand bread were so closely\nrelated?). An interesting\nfact is that many World\nWar II refugees actually\nsurvived on this ingredient due to food shortages\nin Southeast Asia!\nTapioca is sold dried,\noften in the form of a\nwhite flour or flakes,\nrather than your typical\npearls, (although this\nis also done), and used\nfor baking as mentioned\nabove.\nAll in all, despite being\narguably the most exciting\npart of bubble tea, tapioca\nprocessed incorrectly\nfrom the cassava plant can\nlead to a compound which\ntransforms into cyanide \u2013\nbut hey, what doesn\u2019t kill\nyou makes you stronger,\nright? And as a reward\nfor getting through this\narticle, a visit to T4 is\ncertainly in order.\nEamon Akil Farhat\nFood Writer\nFOOD\nJulia Dabrowska\nFood Editor\nISSUE 1711\nFELIX\nFOOD food.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n28\nFuwa Fuwa // Eamon Akil Farhat\nFOOD\nIf you like delicious flavours and something different to fill your belly (and your Instagram feed) take a trip to the\nUK\u2019s only souffl\u00e9 pancake caf\u00e9!\nBubble tea, pudding, pancakes, cakes and everything in between, here\u2019s the low-down on everything Tapioca\nPeach Bubble Tea // omnivorescookbook.com\n\n"

    "content": "Manon: A triumph of expressiveness in ballet\nW\nhat a brilliant night.\nBeing quite\na novice to\nthe ballet world, English\nNational Ballet\u2019s production of Manon was my\nfirst introduction to two\nof its stars \u2013 the choreographer Sir Kenneth\nMacmillan and the ballerina Alina Cojocaru. It\nwas ballet like I\u2019d never\nseen it before, and it was\nbreathtaking.\nOften a problem with\nballet is that it\u2019s actually\na rather bad way to tell\na story \u2013 you need to\nknow the plot beforehand\nor you\u2019ll often end up\nhorribly confused. The\ndancing often exists more\nto show off the dancers\u2019\nabilities than to move the\nstory along, and expressiveness is limited. The\nENB\u2019s recent staging of\nthe classic Swan Lake,\nbased on Petipa/Ivanov\u2019s\nchoreography from 1895,\nis an excellent example.\nSublime the music and the\ndancers might have been,\nbut by the time the fourth\nset of townspeople / courtiers came out to show off\ntheir dance to the prince,\nI \u2013 dare I say? \u2013 found\nmyself slightly bored.\nNot so with Kenneth\nMacmillan\u2019s choreogra-phy. In Manon, choreographed in 1974, each\nmovement has a meaning\nand emotion behind it. It\u2019s\nrealistic, almost natural \u2013\nor as natural as you can\nget when pirouetting in\nskintight leotards. Theatre\nin ballet form. When\nLescaut\u2019s mistress (Katja\nKaniukova) balances\nen pointe on one foot,\ncoquettishly sliding her\nskirts up the other as she\nadvances towards the\nwealthy Monsieur GM, I\nfeel a thrill myself. Who\nknew ballet could be so\nsexy?\nDrunken ballet \u2013 can\nyou imagine it? Macmillan\u2019s choreography\nhas Manon\u2019s brother,\nLescaut, staggering stone\ndrunk into the house of\nharlots. Played by Jeffrey\nCirio, his gestures are\nwild, grand jet\u00e9s all over\nthe place, and more than\nonce I wonder if he\u2019ll\nmisstep and faceplant\ninto the floor. But it\u2019s all\na precisely choreographed\nillusion \u2013 Macmillan\u2019s\nimaginative use of classic\nballet techniques and\nattention to detail makes it\nentirely believable.\nThe same goes for\nour hero Des Grieux, the\nstudent who falls in love\nwith Manon. There\u2019s a\nfantastic scene in Act II\nwhere he sees Manon at\nthe brothel, now the kept\nwoman of another man.\nDriven to distraction by\ngrief, he is left all alone\nas she leaves on Monsieur\nGM\u2019s arm. There is an\nabundance of misery and\ndesolation in the choreog-raphy, here executed beautifully by Joseph Caley.\nSuch misery packed into\nhis simple cha\u00een\u00e9 turns,\narms wrapped around his\nchest as he spins unhappily across the floor.\nBut the star of the\nshow is, beyond a doubt,\nManon herself: Alina\nCojocaru. She\u2019s 37 and\nhas a daughter, but you\nwouldn\u2019t believe it to\nlook at her. With her\nbird-like movements and\nher weightless, fairy-like\ndancing, she looks about\n18 \u2013 every inch the young\ning\u00e9nue that Manon is\nat the beginning of the\nballet. Her effortless\ndancing and beautiful\nlines make for some of\nthe finest ballet I\u2019ve seen.\nAnd then there\u2019s her ex-pressiveness. Manon is a\ncharacter who undergoes\nmultiple transformations\n\u2013 from innocent girl to\nardent lover, and at last\nto fallen woman. She\ndiscovers her own sensu-ality, but is gradually corrupted by money and the\nharsh world around her.\nCojocaru brings this transformation to life before\nour eyes, with every look\nand gesture bringing out\nthe nuances of Manon\u2019s\ncomplex character.\nThe most beautiful\nparts of the ballet are the\nthree pas de deux danced\nbetween Manon and her\nlover, des Grieux. At their\nfirst meeting, with the shy\ninnocence of young love.\nThen their playful, sensual\nduet full of unbridled joy.\nAnd finally, desperation\nand passion in equal\nmeasure as Manon meets\nher doomed end. Cojocaru\nand Caley make each one\na masterpiece. Their interpretation and technical\nskill intersect such that we\nno longer see them as just\n\u2018ballet dancers\u2019, dutifully\nfulfilling parts on stage;\nthey embody Manon and\ndes Grieux, their story\nplaying out before our\neyes in dance form.\nKenneth Macmillan\u2019s\ninnovative choreography\nis the key to this breathtaking realism. Classical\nthemes and classical\nstyles, and yet his choreography feels so fresh and\nexciting. Maybe because\nMacmillan didn\u2019t come\nfrom the traditional ballet\nbackground. Coming\nfrom a working-class\nfamily and starting ballet\nrelatively late, he reportedly always felt himself\nan outsider in the insular\nworld of ballet. This was\ndespite his considerable\nachievements \u2013 becoming\nthe primary choreographer for the Royal Ballet\nand even being knighted\nfor his services.\nHe was bit of a\nmaverick for his time,\na breath of fresh air in\nthe decorous world of\nballet. Describing the\nballet scene of the 1940s,\nhe said, \u201cBallet looked\nlike window-dressing. I\nwanted to make ballets in\nwhich an audience would\nbecome caught up with\nthe fate of the characters\nI showed them.\u201d With\nManon, he certainly\nsucceeded. No prettified\nwindow-dressing to be\nseen here; raw emotions\nand feeling take centre\nstage. You can\u2019t tear your\neyes away.\nAlina Cojocaru and cast deliver an outstanding performance of Kenneth Macmillan\u2019s breathtaking ballet\nAlina Cojocaru and Joseph Caley in Manon // Laurent Liotardo\nARTS\nFRIDAY, 25TH\nJANUARY, 2019 FELIX\n16\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nClaire Chan\nArts Editor\nWhere?

Since\nthen the franchise has\ngone on to grow in many\ndifferent directions as the\nstory has become more\ncomplex with 14 titles\nreleased over the past\n17 years having shipped\nover 25 million copies\nworldwide.\nWhere and How\nDid It All Begin?\nAt TGS 2004, the\nKingdom Hearts Director\nTetsuya Nomura revealed\nthat the series started when\na Square game producer,\nShinji Hashimoto, was\nguided by fate to meet\na top Disney executive\nwhilst in an elevator.\nHow did this coincidental\nmeeting happen? Well,\nSquare and Disney used to\nwork in the same building.\nHashimoto delivered\nhis elevator pitch to the\nexecutive and in February\n2000, development began\nfor Kingdom Hearts.\nThe story, which\noriginally was going to be\naimed at Disney\u2019s target\naudience was reimagined\nto become as great and as\nepic as the stories told in\nthe Final Fantasy series.\nWith Nomura developing\nthe story to be about the\nthemeofcharacter\u2019shearts\n(and trust me on this,\n\u201chearts\u201d alongside other\nkey phrases, \u201cDarkness\u201d,\n\u201cSora, Donald, Goofy\u201d\nare repeated endlessly\nin this franchise), and\nby thinking of Disney\ntheme parks, like Animal\nKingdom, Square\u2019s new\nIP would soon bare the\ntitle Kingdom Hearts - the\nname Kingdom wouldn\u2019t\nhave been enough for\nSquare.\nTo test the waters of\nthe future of the series,\nNomura put a secret movie\nat the end of the first game\nusing Disney\u2019s assets. For\nNomura, he believed there\nwas no reason to change\nthe worlds, but instead\nthat it was Square\u2019s\nprerogative to bring out\nthe best of what Disney\nhas already done with\ntheir characters.\nSpeaking of characters,\nvarious adaptions of the\nFinal Fantasy characters\nhave appeared throughout\nthe series, from cartoonish\nversions of beloved\ncharacters to darker,\nmysterious adaptations of\nothers.

He believed that\nthe universe was too far\naligned with the light\nand believes that the\nworld should be perfectly\nbalanced (as all things\nshould be) \u2013 equal light\nandequaldarkness.Tothis\nend he alters the destinies\nof three young Keyblade\nwarriors \u2013 Ventus, Aqua\nand Terra.

Xemnas goes on\nto lead an organisation of\nnobodies called Organisation XIII.\nKH1\nAt the start of the first\ngame, Sora\u2019s home world\nis attacked by Heartless\nand he loses both of his\nfriends, Kairi and Riku.\nSora ends up on a quest\nalongside Donald Duck\nand Goofy to save the\nother Dinsey worlds from\nthe darkness \u2013 a mission\ngiven to them by King\nMickey.\nSadly though, Riku\ngets lured into darkness\nby Maleficent as he tries\nto find Kairi through his\nown means. The puppet\nmaster behind the two\nof them is the Heartless\ncalled Ansem, who possesses Riku during the\nevents of the first game.\nWhat was Ansem\u2019s goal\nin all of this? Well, using\nMaleficent, he manipulated several Disney villains\nto capture Seven Princesses of Heart. Seven?\nHaven\u2019t we already heard\nthis number before? Well,\nyes we have. The seven\nfragments of pure light\nbecame the hearts of the\nprincesses. Turns out that\nKairi was one of these\nprincesses, however hear\nheart latched onto Sora\u2019s\nduring the invasion of\ntheir home world. To\ngive Kairi her heart back,\nSora uses Riku/Ansem\u2019s\nkeyblade to carve out his\nheart. Remember what\nhappened to Xehanort?\nWell, something slightly\ndifferent happens here.\nNobodies of both Kairi\nand Sora are created,\nNamine and Roxas re-spectively.\nCOM and Days\nNamin\u00e9 has the power\nto manipulate Sora\u2019s\nmemories, so some rebels\nwithintheorganisationuse\nher in attempt to control\nour keyblade wielding\nprotagonist.

As the audience\nstumbles out of our shared\nreverie, the sentiment\nis echoed through the\nfoyer. The performance\nwas well-executed, from\neerily lifelike puppetry\nto the clever weaving of\nfairytale themes. But there\nwas no easy message\noffered on a platter to the\nbemused, yet amused,\nspectators. Thank god!\nI attended this performance on the same\nevening as the Brexit deal\nvote. While media pundits\nand armchair analysts\ndesperately tried to grasp\nmeaning amid the anarchy\nof the night, the Waltz\noffered welcome refuge.\nUnlike our national eman-cipation, the performance\noffered solace in surreal-ism, and an escape into\nthe nostalgia of European\nfolklore. We were served\nan antidote to the miserable realism of everyday\nlife.\nThe show begins before\nthe audience has even\nfound their seats. A figure\nwearing a bird mask\nslowly feeds string into a\ncotton mule, the machinery\u2019s creaks raising hair\nand eyebrows alike. She\ncocks her head sideways\nat passers-by as the lights\ndim. As she weaves her\nnest, the Waltz of the\nHommelettes begins.\nFor some, a clear plot\nserves as a source of\ncertainty and safety in\nthe face of fast-paced,\nor introspective, scenes.\nYet, Les Antliaclastes\noffer no such guarantee.\nLike the frantic mind of\na child, we are ferried\nbetween subplots and\nskits, not pausing for\nlong enough to sink into\nphilosophical analysis.\nTheir skill lies not in\nexplanation, but pure unadulterated entertainment.\nTo do so, they draw on\nsyncretic Pagan-Christian\nmythos and lore. From\nthe comically macabre\nelves strutting across\nthe shoemaker\u2019s floor\nto the pantomime-like\nexploits of the Rabbit, we\nare treated to elements\nof Graham Greene, the\nBrothers Grimm, and\nAesop\u2019s fables.\nThis ballad to tradi-tional, rural Europe is\nalso found in the accompanying sound. Benjamin\nBritten\u2019s \u2018Cuckoo\u2019\nnests comfortably in the\nsoundtrack, alongside\nthe haunting melodies of\nLouis Thomas Hardin,\nAKA Moondog (the\nViking of 6th\nAvenue, a\nvisionary worthy of more\npraise than I have space\nfor here).\nI recall attending a\npuppetry workshop at the\nBarbican as a child, where\nwe were taught to incorporate as much care and\nattention in building the\npuppet as we would then\nshow in our performance.\nIn doing so, the marionette\nbecomes an extension of\nits invisible master. The\nAntliaclastes know this all\ntoo well, as the transition\nfrom actor to puppeteer\nlost none of the playful\nand esoteric joy.\nWhat, if anything, is\nthere to \u2018get\u2019 from such an\neccentric journey through\nfolklore? Director Patrick\nSims puts it well in an interview with the Barbican,\nwhere the \u201calchemical\nsymbolism\u201d of the tales\nskewers the \u201chypocrisy\nof adult logic\u201d, using the\nsupernatural to wordless-ly discuss morality. As\nchildren, we all enjoyed\nthe adventure of tales\nand fables, but it is the\nwisdom they instilled in\nus that allows such stories\nto stand the test of time.\nDo not go to the Waltz\nof the Hommelettes if you\nwant instant pleasure, an\neasy watch, or a jester\u2019s\njig. Go to see centuries\nof tradition distilled into\nmasterful performance,\nto enjoy release from the\nstrains of adult life, and\nto rekindle the unspoken\njoie de vivre that childhood brings.\nArt Below Hyde Park\nB\ny using advertising space in\nLondon\u2019s iconic\nu n d e rg r o u n d\nstations to showcase\nartwork, independent arts\norganisationArtBelowhas\ntwo powerful missions:\nrendering contemporary\nart accessible to millions\nof commuters, and\ncreating a platform for\npromising as well as\ninternationally-renowned\nartists to reach novel\naudiences. Attending\ntheir latest vernissage\nArt Below Hyde Park at\nHerrick Gallery in the\nvery heart of Mayfair not\nonly gave me the immense\nsatisfaction of discovering\na hidden gem in London,\nbut also left me with new\nimpressions and refreshing perspectives on public\nengagement with art.\nArt Below\u2019s show\nconsisted of a variety of\npaintings and sculptures,\nas well as prints and\ndrawings made by twenty artists from all corners\nof the world. Some of the\nexhibited works will be\ndisplayed on billboards\nat the Hyde Park Corner\ntube station for two weeks\nuntil the 28th\nof January to\nbrighten and sweeten the\ncommute of an expected\n10,000 people.\nStepping into Herrick\nGallery, the black and\nwhite drawings of Munich-based artist Falk von\nSch\u00f6nfels immediately\ncaught my eye. His artworks not only fit perfectly in the urban setting of\nthe London Underground\nbut also resonate with\ntoday\u2019s era of hysteria\nand continuous frenzy of\nfake news. Von Sch\u00f6nfels\ncombines this madness\nwith his inspiration from\npoetry and esoterism to\nproduce these outstanding\ndrawings, captioned with\ncrazy titles. I will definitely not forget his artworks easily and I would\ndo everything for a t-shirt\nwith these striking graph-ics.\nGoing down the gallery\u2019s staircase, I discovered my favourite piece\nof the entire show: Rose\nLong\u2019s Babushka. I am\nnot sure whether it was\nthe strong and powerful\ncontrast between dark and\nbright colours or Long\u2019s\nwork with different patterns and textures that\nmade me fall for this particular painting. There is\nsomething special about\nthe look and the gaze of\nthe depicted girl, who\nhappens to be the artist\u2019s\nmother at the age of five,\nthat makes you want to\nstand in the front of this\npainting for ages without\nnoticing time passing.\nFreudian Slip by the\ntalented Gia Strauss,\nwhich blends controversies around plastic surgery\nand the objectification of\nwomen into a distorted\nPicasso-like portrait, also\nattracted audiences. Another crowd-pleaser was\nTim Gatenby\u2019s abstraction\nof childhood memories,\nFrog Life \u2013 a truly unique\nmixture of distorted mem-ories, commercialism and\npop culture.\nThe showcase of these\nand many other original\npieces, together with performances throughout the\nevening and free-flow-ing prosecco turned the\nevening into a real suc-cess. What strikes me\nmost, however, is the\nunderlying vision of Art\nBelow, namely making art\navailable everywhere and\nfor everybody. Who says\nthat art should be something exclusive behind\nclosed doors? Why can\u2019t\na tube station serve as a\nmuseum and inspire busy\nurban people to appreciate the beauty and value\nof art? I was impressed by\nthe aspiration of Art Below\u2019s curator Ben Moore\nto create a vibrant community of different artists\nand taking their art into a\npublic context. I can only\nhope that this will inspire\nartists of the next generation\u2026\nIf this has awakened\nyour curiosity, don\u2019t forget that you can check out\nthe prints of several artworks for free at the Hyde\nPark Corner underground\nstation. Art Below\u2019s is\nrunning another exhibition called \u2018Plei\u2019 from the\n24th January until the 6th\nof February at the Riverside studio at Re:center in\nHammersmith, with a variety of artworks dedicated to the concept of play.\nLa Valse des Hommelettes // E.

We have developed\na preconceived notion of\nartists being isolated in\ntheir artistic journeys. We\ntend to forget the environment that nourishes them,\nespecially love, intimacy,\nand passion, which inspire\ngreat art. The pursuit\nof love, much like the\npursuit of art, is a tumultuous affair, paved with\nthe greatest joys and the\ndeepest sorrows. Modern\nCouples shines a spotlight\non the intimate space between artist couples \u2013 how\nit changed them, and their\nart, in return.\nThe moment you enter\nthe exhibition, you get\na sense of peeking into\na clandestine affair. The\nexhibition covers the\nlives of around forty artist\ncouples. Not restricted\nto any one discipline, it\nbrings artists from all\nwalks of life: musicians,\nphotographers, painters,\nsculptors, writers, ar-chitects, and designers.\nThe visitors are invited\ninto their lives through\nartworks, photographs,\nand excerpts from intimate\nletters and other texts. The\nexhibition is categorized\ninto interrelated themes:\nRussian Avant-garde,\nSurrealism, Bauhaus,\nthe Bloomsbury Group,\nFuturism, homosexuality,\nand so forth. The visitors\nfind artists in different\nphases of their relationships and how in turn their\nart was influenced. Major\nart figures of this era have\nbeen included \u2013 Rodin,\nKahlo, Picasso, Dali, Max\nErnst, Klimt, and Man\nRay, to name a few. The\ncouples are well chosen\nby the curators and they\nnever seem to bore. Each\nrelationship gives a fresh\nperspective and an awareness of the fragile components in a relationship\nthat we take for granted.\nFrom the great love story\nof Barbara Hepworth and\nBen Nicholson to the\ntragic love affair of Dora\nMaar and Picasso, the\nexhibition encompasses\nthe entire spectrum.\nAn important aspect\nthat the exhibition tries to\nemphasise is the mutually\nconducive collaboration\nbetween the partners.\nOne of the most famous\npartnerships is between\nGustav Klimt and Emilie\nFl\u00f6ye. Klimt often incorporated the intricate\npatterns of Fl\u00f6ye\u2019s\nfashion designs into his\npaintings. His most iconic\npainting, The Kiss, is one\nof the finest examples of\nthe amalgamation of the\narts and fashion. Georgia\nO\u2019Keeffe\u2019s paintings\nbear a heavy influence\nfrom Modernist pho-tography, possibly due\nto her relationship with\nthe famous photographer,\nAlfred Stieglitz. Often,\nthe couple worked on\nthe same subjects, yet\nexpressed themselves in\ntotally disparate ways.\nFor instance, inspired by\nStieglitz\u2019s Songs of the\nSky, No. 2, Keeffe, a year\nlater, came up with her\ndreamy version of the\nsame landscape. It was\nlike an intimate exchange\nbetween lovers through\ntheir artistic prowess.\nThrough their relation-ships, these couples\nexplored the true meaning\nof love and their own\nidentity. By illuminating\nthe collaborations, the\nexhibition also brings into\nthe limelight the many\nfemale artists that had\nremained overshadowed\nby their male counterparts.\nIt is interesting how\nrelationships changed\nthe fabric of their lives.\nMany of these artists\nfound meaning and\npurpose in their lives\nduring these relationships.\nTwo examples of this are\nTina Modotti and Nancy\nCunard. Modotti, who had\nbeen an established actor\nin America, found fulfilment through photogra-phy. She became a student\nof the famous photogra-pher, Edward Weston.\nThe student-master\nrelationship soon turned\ninto an affair. During this\nphase, Modotti found\nher independent voice in\nphotography and focused\nher attention on political\nactivism, especially in\nMexico.\nNancy Cunard, a\nBritish writer and heiress,\nfound purpose in her\nlife after encountering\nHenry Crowder, a black\nAmerican jazz musician.\nHer affair with Crowder\nin the early 1900s attracted much media attention\nand a storm of hate mail.\nThis opened her eyes to\nthe tremendous racial\ninjustice and oppression\nof black Americans. With\nthe help of Crowder and\nother prominent writers,\nshe went on to publish and\nedit a 900-page anthology\non Black history. Her\nsubsequent life became\na crusade against racism\nand exposing the hypocrisy of the British upper\nclass.\nOne of my favourites\nis the room exhibiting\nthe Lee Miller\u2019s pictures\ntaken by Man Ray. Miller,\nwho had been a model\nin New York, moved to\nParis to learn photography\nfrom Man Ray. Starting\nas an apprentice, she soon\nworked as an equal with\nRay. She was his muse\nand the great love of his\nlife. Ray, intoxicated\nwith love, framed tender\npictures of her, notably\nthe nudes. Together, they\ncreated and explored new\ntechniques in photogra-phy, the most famous\nbeing solarization, a\ntechnique which became\na significant milestone in\nphotography.\nAt the same time,\nMiller\u2019s more in-depth\npursuit of photography\nwas demanding greater\nindependence. Ray could\nnot endure this and was\nsoon torn apart following\ntheir breakup. The room\nnext to this, featuring\nMad Love, exhibits works\ncreated by Ray during\nthis despair. One of the\nprominent ones is the\nIndestructible Object (or\nObject to Be Destroyed).\nThe metronome, with\na pendulum bearing\nMiller\u2019s eyes, is accompanied by an instruction:\n\u201cCut out the eye from\nthe photograph of one who\nhas been loved but is seen\nno more. Attach the eye\nto the pendulum of a metronome and regulate the\nweight to suit the tempo\ndesired. Keep going to the\nlimit of endurance. With a\nhammer well-aimed, try\nto destroy the whole at a\nsingle blow.\u201d\nThe exhibition loses\nits sheen, particularly in\none aspect: its attempt to\ncover too many lives in a\nrelatively small exhibition\nspace at the Barbican.\nInstead of exploring a few\npersonal stories, it tries\nto cover too much. The\nvisitors, in the end, are\nonly able to get scattered\nsnapshots of the couples,\ngiving a hazy glimpse of\ntheir relationships without\na greater understanding\nof their precise nature.\nMoreover, the exhibition\ndoes not give equal\nweight to all the couples.\nInstead, the focus is\ncommensurate to the\npopularity and influence\nof the artists. This could\nbe probably due to limited\nresources regarding the\nmore obscure artists or\njust because the lives of\nprominent artists attract\nmore visitors.\nThere is a feeling of\nhaving visited a secret\nsociety; a dizzy headache\nbuilds up after seeing so\nmuch in a small space.\nModern Couples is a\nnear unattainable feat, an\nambitious effort to put\ntogether unheard, obscure\npersonal accounts of the\nlives of artists. It surprises,\nit enlightens the visitors.\nIt leaves us wondering\nabout our relationships in\nthese current times and\nthe true meaning of love\nand its expression.\nARTS\nFRIDAY, 25TH\nJANUARY, 2019 FELIX\n13\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nRuchir Dwivedi\nArts Writer\nWhere?

More\nthan that, the\nwhole country is\nin trouble. Last week the\ngovernment lost its vote\nto pass the withdrawal\nagreement, a 500-page\nlegal document taking\nthe UK out of the EU in\nan orderly fashion. She is\nto hold another vote on\nJanuary the 29th (if she\ndoes not delay this one),\nwhile currently seeking\nconsultation with other\nparty leaders and MPs\nof different views both\nwithin and outside the\nConservative Party, in an\nattempt to pass the deal.\nThis, however, is\nfutile. Should Theresa\nMay manage to get the\ndeal to pass on the 29th\nof January, even if she\ngot it to pass today, there\nstill would not be enough\ntime to pass the 5 major\nbills and 600 statutory\ninstruments (a form of\nlegislation) that make up\nthe withdrawal agreement\nbefore Brexit day, 29th\nMarch.\nCome the 29th of\nMarch, there are two\noutcomes. Either a \u201chard\nBrexit\u201d in the form of\nno deal, or an extension/\nrevocation of article 50.\nShould the government\nseekanextensionofarticle\n50, the 27 member states\nof the EU will confer as\nto whether to grant this\nrequest or not. The EU has\nsaid previously that they\nwill not grant an extension\nwithout a good reason.\nTheresa May\u2019s schedule\nis unlikely to qualify. This\nmeans that Theresa May\u2019s\ndeal, even if it had parliamentary support, is dead\non its knees.\nSo what are the other\noptions? A new referendum or a changing\nof Theresa May\u2019s red\nlines, allowing for the\nnegotiation of a different\nwithdrawal agreement,\ncould persuade the EU\nto grant an extension to\narticle 50. EU officials\nhave stated that they\nwon\u2019t grant an extension\nbeyond the European parliamentary elections from\nstarting May 23rd. A new\nreferendum takes at least\n22 weeks to organise,\naccording to usual parliamentary procedure. So\nif a new referendum is to\nbe called, the UK must\nrequest extending article\n50, the EU must agree, and\nparliament must legislate\nthe referendum (choosing\nand agreeing upon the\nquestion). Should a referendum be announced\non the day of you reading\nthis, there will already be\nless than 16 weeks. Thus,\nthe option of a second\nreferendum can also be\ndiscarded. That means\nthat the one and only for\nthe Prime Minister is to\nchange her Red Lines.\nShe has shown great reluctance to do so, insisting\nthat no deal must always\nbe an option, that we\nmust leave the customs\nunion and cease freedom\nof movement. If she does\ncompromise on one of her\nred lines, she will need\nto re-negotiate with the\nEU, get a new deal, pass\nit through parliament and\nget all 5 major bills and\n600 statutory instruments\nthrough, all done before\nthe 29th March, or the\n23rd May with an article\n50 extension. Not impos-sible, but again unlikely.\nTherefore, it can be safely\nstated that at this point, no\ndeal is looking inevitable.\nThere is one option,\nthe unspeakable option,\nwhich must be discussed.\nArticle 50 can be revoked\nby the UK at any time\nbefore March 29th, 11pm.\nThis would provoke widespread anger amongst\nBrexit supporters should\nJune 23rd, 2016. Some\ncivil unrest and riots are\nbeing anticipated by the\ngovernment whom are\npreparing to put 3500\nmilitary staff on the streets\nafter Brexit day to retain\ncivil order. The benefits\nto a no deal are of course\nthat the 2016 referendum\npledge is fulfilled, no\ndivorce bill as with May\u2019s\ndeal and the ability for the\nUK to make new laws that\nwould replace or change\nthose we currently obey\nunder the EU.\nIf article 50 is revoked,\nlarger civil unrest is anticipated along with a rise in\nhatecrime.Trustinpolitics\nis likely to fall further\ngiven the subversion of\ndemocracy as perceived\nby voters, particularly\nBrexit voters. However,\nlife would carry on as\nnormal, no food shortages\nor medical rationing, our\ninternational reputation\nand influence would start\nto be somewhat restored\nand business investment\nshould return to the UK.\nThe UK government\ncould once again turn\nits attention to pressing\ndomestic issues including\nrising homelessness,\nthe NHS funding crisis\nand housing shortages.\nThe backlash from upset\nvoters is the unknown\nvariable in the cancel\nBrexit equation and so we\nmust make a judgement\nas to whether this newly\nbuilt resentment is worth\nthe economic benefits and\npolitical stability from\nstaying in the EU, or not.\nWhatever they decide,\nthey must do so soon.

Not only does this\nmis-gender trans women\nin the headline, but it is\nalso a classic fearmonger-ing tactic that hearkens\nback to the days of \u2018gay\nmen are a danger to your\nchildren\u2019 and other such\n80s classics. Transphobia\nis not exclusive to right\nleaning newspapers \u2013\neven the supposedly\nliberal Guardian ran an\neditorial claiming that\nthe rights of trans women\ncollide with those of cis\nwomen, despite numerous academic studies\nshowing otherwise. The\nGuardian\u2019s own US\njournalists wrote an article denouncing the UK\neditorial as \u201cadvancing\ntransphobic viewpoints\nthat are driving attacks on\ntrans rights in America\u201d.\nClearly, there is a long\nway to go to securing\nacceptance and rights for\ntrans people, especially\nhere in the UK.\nThis is where things\nget a bit weird: a\nfew months ago, the\nNational Lottery Fund\nannounced a \u00a3500,000\ngrant to Mermaids, a\nUK charity that provides\nmental health support\nfor transgender and\ngender diverse children.\nThis was met with praise\nfrom the progressive\nparts of the political\nspectrum, and disdain\nfrom one Graham\nLinehan, the creator of\nshows such as Father\nTed and The IT Crowd\n(yep, we are in a weird\ntimeline). Linehan,\nknown as @Glinner on\nTwitter, proceeded to\nrally transphobes on\nMumsnet (again, it\u2019s a\nweird timeline) to spam\nthe National Lottery\nFund with faux concerns\nabout the charity\nuntil they announced\nthey were carrying\nout a review of the\ngrant.

The first of\nwhich, a spacey yet\nmelodic track delivered\nlargely by Travis Scott,\nwhose ability to hold a\ntune almost excuses his\ngeneric and materialistic\nlyricism. Blake\u2019s contribution on a long-distance\nrelationship slipping\naway and Metro\u2019s punchy\nproduction come through\nto hold the track together\nwell. The crowded beat\nand repetitive lyrics on\nBoomin\u2019s next contribution \u2018Tell Them\u2019 leaves a\nlot to be desired, proving\nperhaps, that lightning\ndoesn\u2019t strike twice.\nThe other two features,\nROSAL\u00cdA and Andr\u00e9\n3000, develop themes laid\nout by Blake (personal-ity-consuming love and\ndepression respectively)\non their tracks well, but are\nlet down by production.\nThe uninspiring beat on\n\u2018Where\u2019s the Catch?\u2019finds\nAndr\u00e9\u2019s flow awkwardly\nstatic. \u2018Barefoot in the\nPark\u2019, however, delivers\na hauntingly sweet punch\ndespite its percussive\nstagnation, ROSAL\u00cdA\u2019s\nvoice ornamenting\nBlake\u2019s beautifully.\nThe remainder of the\nrecord finds Blake perhaps\na little too comfortable\nbehind his piano, with production from himself and\nDominic Maker (Mount\nKimbie) struggling to add\nanything of note. Songs\nlike \u2018Into the Red\u2019 and\n\u2018Don\u2019t Miss It\u2019 showcase\nBlake\u2019s lyrical and\nmelodic skill in spades,\nwith a heart-rendingness\nthat makes their shroud\nof bubbling electronics\nenjoyable. Other tracks\nincluding closer \u2018Lullaby\nfor My Insomniac\u2019 bring\nlittle in the way of songwriting to the table, behind\nwhich Assume Form\u2019s\nuninteresting production\nfalls flat.\nThe critical acclaim of\nBlake\u2019s first three records,\nwith a Mercury Prize and\nco-signs from the likes\nof Kanye West have,\nadmittedly set Blake up\nfor failure. But not to the\ndegree that can be heard\non \u2018Can\u2019t Believe the Way\nWe Flow\u2019, a track whose\nmelody could be pleasant\nenough, did it not take up\nthe track\u2019s entire length,\ncaked in flat digital\nreverb.\nWhile James Blake\u2019s\ntrademark blend of\nsinger-songwriter and\natmospheric electronics\ndo produce a few sparks\nhere, the record has a\nfew too many duds to\ncreate a cohesive listen.\nProduction choices or\nunderdeveloped lyrics\nweaken even its best\ntracks, often failing to do\nits contributors justice,\nBlake included.\nKobala Revisited: Afriquoi storm XOYO\nA\nf r i q u o i\ndescribe themselves simply\nas an \u201cafro\nsupergroup\u201d who perform \u201clive African dance\nmusic fusing Congolese\nguitar + Gambian kora\nvirtuosity with UK electronic sensibilities\u201d.

The nature\nof this quiet and under-discussed release is what\nmakes the decision to\nperform these new songs\nalmost exclusively so\ninteresting, and polar-ising. They\u2019re not what\nBen is known for, and in\nBrixton, clearly not what\nthe majority of the audience wanted.\nFromthisshowitisclear\nthat Ben has disavowed\ncompletely the music that\nmade him famous. On his\nnewest album the sunny,\nearnest melodies and\nsing-along choruses of\nEvery Kingdom make way\nfor obtuse, poetic lyrics,\nunassuming singing, and\ngradual builds in intensity\nthat impact only if you\nmanaged to sufficiently\nfocus your attention on\nthe initial quiet, which\nat times is no small feat.\nWith this as his new\nsound, it is no wonder\nthat he did not perform a\nsingle one of the cheerful\ncampfire songs that made\nhim famous; their carefree\nand direct sound is the\nantithesis of what he now\nseems to value.\nimpressed by the focus\non this material, and\nomission of the songs\nthey doubtless bought\ntickets to hear. Shouts of\n\u201cplay the good songs!\u201d,\nand audience noise that at\ntimes rivalled in volume\nthe music coming from\nthe stage, demonstrated\nthe lack of patience for the\nnew material, which undeniably requires concerted\neffort to appreciate, and\nwas perhaps not suited to\nsuch a large venue.\nThere is, however,\nsomething incredibly\nbold about disavowing\nyour old music entirely. It\ntakes bravery to defy the\nwishes of your audience,\nto stick to your guns in\nthe belief that your old,\neasy-listening sound is\noverly simplistic and\nunrealistically cheery. It\u2019s\nas if on the first album he\ncrafted upbeat and blissful\nsongs that were almost too\ngood to be true, a sense of\nartificiality and idealism\nto their sound, and now he\nhas found more honest art\nin realism and subtlety.\nInstead of an evening\nplaying the hits and\ngiving the crowd what\nthey wanted, Ben and\nhis band created a quiet\natmosphere, and one\nthat required work and\npatience to appreciate.\nWith this show comes an\ninteresting question; what\ndo the audience deserve,\nhaving purchased a\nticket? Does their money\npurchase the right to hear\nexactly what they want to\nhear? Or does the artist\nhave ultimate control,\nowing nothing to their\naudience, and should be\nable to perform what they\nbelieve is most important,\nmost true to themselves? It\nis abundantly clear which\nside of this argument Ben\nis on, although a vast\nmajority of the audience\nclearly disagreed.\nIt was admittedly\ndifficult to focus on at\ntimes, but every song\nwas beautiful in its own\nquiet way, with a few\nmoments of true, goose-bump-inducing potency.\nAnd when coupled with\nthe undeniable honesty\nand artistic integrity\nof choosing newfound\nsubtly over singalongs, it\nwas a gig like few others;\nmodest, sombre, and with\njust enough patience.\nCaptivating.\nThe wicked WIZRD of Sauce\nF\nuture has always\nbeen a hit-making\nmachine. Earlier\nin his career\nhe adopted (and simultaneously established)\na decidedly pimpish\nAtlanta trapper sound.\nSince then, Future has\nachieved ridiculous\ninternational recognition,\nthe DJ Eskimo tags long\ngone. What set him apart\nfrom a Wacka Flaka or a\nJeezy was his consistent\ndedication to both authenticity and progression of\nthe sound. Yes a perfectly\ntimed Drake consign in\nthe form of the excellent What A Time To Be\nAlive collab project was\nsignificant. But most fans\nwill tell you that DS2,\nreleased the same year,\nor mixtapes like Monster\nor Beast Mode released\nprior to that, were better\njustification for his legend\nstatus.\nModern day Future is\nless predictable. It feels as\nthough the enduring buzz\nsurrounding his name\nowes itself to the social\nmedia obsessives with the\npimp culture his recent\nsound has, to some extent,\nironically departed from,\nor become a more commercialised version of.\nThat in itself is not even\na criticism. However,\nthe resulting effect has\nbeen that the regular filler\ntracks or repetitiveness\ncommon in recent Future\nprojects have become a\nsort of elephant in the\nroom. Having said that,\nThe WIZRD is pretty\nmuch devoid of either.\nThe album starts off\nwith the introspective\nand mature \u2018Never Stop\u2019.\nFuture gets real about the\nmaterialism his lifestyle\nis soaked in (\u201cI got so\nrich, nothing matters to\nme\u201d) whilst recounting\nthe unsteady path he\u2019s\ntaken to get there with a\ntriumphent grace. This is\na theme reflected also in\nthe layered and earnest\n\u2018Temptation\u2019. True,\nthough Future\u2019s sauced\nout bragadocio accounts\nfor a decent portion of\nwhat we get from this\nalbum, a significant\namount of range is also\ndemonstrated. As such,\nthe more simple tracks are\nkept effective and short\n(\u2018Rocket Ship\u2019, \u2018Promised\nU That\u2019, \u2018Stick To the\nModels\u2019 and \u2018Overdose\u2019)\nto make way for more\nmemorable tracks that\nare truly unique and\nfully formed concepts.\nFor example, \u2018Call the\nCoroner\u2019 sees Future spit\na tight verse in a regale\nbellow with a slight rattle\nto his voice, emulating a\npissed off king. \u2018Krazy\nBut True\u2019 sees Future\nspeaking on the topic of\nrecognition with a captivating flow and cadence\nover dynamic production\nfeaturing swirling, distort-ed, high pitched moans.\nThe most high-energy\nproduction moments\nbring out the most savage\nmoments from Future.\n\u2018Crushed Up\u2019, \u2018Servin\nKilla Kam\u2019, \u2018Faceshots\u2019\nare each fairly close to\nDS2 level, the last being\nthe grimiest. Future seems\nvery aware that it feels\nlike the soundtrack to a\nmustang drift, summa-rising the aesthetic very\nsimply: \u201cSkrrt, skrrt in\na fast car\u201d. \u2018F&N\u2019 and\n\u2018Baptiize\u2019 are two other\nbrilliantly produced\ntracks, featuring ingenious beat switches. Future\nkeeps it together over\nthe gluiding, lil uzi-style\nsynths on \u2018Goin Dummi\u2019\ntoo, a genuinely endearing\nand soothing track.\nThe few features that\nappear near the end of the\nalbum certainly contribute\npositively. \u2018Unicorn Purp\u2019\nis a building banger,\nthough Young Thug\nand Gunna somewhat\nhighjack the track with\ntheir dope back and forth\nin the second half. The\nTravis feature, though\nfairly self contained and\nlowkey, is also decent.\nOverall, WIZRD does\nlend confidence to the\nfuture of Future\u2019s sound.\nClearly, his long and\nsuccessful career is by no\nmeans in the business of\nwinding down.\nLions and tigers and bears, oh my! // Epic/Freebandz\nMUSIC\nAlex Large\nMusic Writer\nVenue: O2 Academy\nBrixton.

Types one to three\ncorrelate with increasing\nseverity, with three being\nthe most severe. Type 1 is\ntermed clitoridectomy and\ninvolves partial or total\nremoval of the clitoris.\nType 2 is often referred\nto excision, and results\nin partial or total removal\nof the clitoris as well as\nthe labia minora (inner\nfolds of the vulva) with or\nwithout the labia majora.\nType 3 is called infib-ulation and is the most\nextreme form of all types.\nIt involves the narrowing\nof the vaginal opening\nby cutting, repositioning\nand stitching the labia to\ncreate a covering seal.\nType 4 encompasses all\nother harmful procedures\nto the female genitalia\nfor non-medical purposes\nsuch as pricking, piercing,\nincision, scraping and\ncauterisation of the\ngenital area. Type 4 also\nincludes labiaplasty,\nwhich is vulval surgery\nto reduce the size of the\nlabia minora often done\nfor cosmetic reasons.\nThere are several social,\ncultural and religious justifications underpinning\nfemale genital mutilation\n(FGM) practice which\nallow its propagation.\nFGM is often regarded as\nthe \u2018right of passage\u2019 to\nbecome a woman.\nWhy it\u2019s an important\nissue?\nFGM affects over 140\nmillion women world-wide, and over 127,000\nin the UK itself. FGM\ncan have countless consequences to women, both\nphysically and mentally.\nWhen FGM is done,\nanaesthetic is rarely used,\ncausing severe pain to the\nwoman or child. There is\na risk of infection and the\nincreased transmission of\ndiseases such as HIV, as\ninstruments are not sterilised between procedures.\nFGM is also associated with obstetric and\ngynaecological problems\nsuch as painful periods.\nWomen are at greater risk\nof complications during\nchildbirth such as excruciating pain and the risk of\nhaemorrhaging.\nFGM can also cause\nlifelong psychological\nissues such as PTSD and\ntrauma during intimacy.\nIf a girl is under 16\nand FGM is performed\non her, it is considered\nchild abuse. If you help or\nencourage FGM it is also\nagainst the law in the UK\nand you are at risk of up to\n14 years in prison.\nWho are FORWARD\nand what do they do?\nFORWARD (Foun-dation for Women\u2019s\nHealth Research and\nDevelopment) is an\nAfrican diaspora women\u2019s\ncharity that tackles gender\nequality issues such as\ndomestic violence, child\nmarriage and obstetric\nfistula. They have a particular focus on FGM and\nare the leading charity in\nthe UK on the subject.\nFORWARD offers\na range of services for\nwomen affected by FGM,\nsuch as one to one coun-selling, workshops and\nfree legal advice. They\nalso run monthly coffee\nmornings where women\ncan have a safe space\nto talk, often bringing\nin guest speakers on\ndifferent topics that the\nwomen choose each\nmonth. FORWARD can\nalso help signpost people\nto appropriate services\nand are willing to come\nalong as an advocate to\nhelp women in navigating\nother organisations such\nas the NHS or other FGM\nfocussed charities.\nThey also do lots of\nwork on the prevention of\ndo we stop it?\nIt is vital to prevent\nFGM before it even occurs\nand the best way to do this\nis to increase awareness\nabout it.\nThis can be done\nthrough education\nprograms, community\nintervention schemes and\nshowing people that it is\nokay to talk about it in the\nfirst place.\nThere also needs to be\nfurther research conducted to establish the actual\nprevalence of FGM in the\nUK as many believe it is\ncurrently significantly\nunderreported.\nLastly, the government\nmust see FGM as an important issue, and needs\nto increase funding and\nprovide more resources\nfor the fight against FGM.\nWhat can I do to help?\nThere are many ways\nto get involved. You can\nhelp by raising awareness,\nspeaking out and funding\ncharities that work to end\nFGM.\nIf you\u2019re interested in\ndonating to FORWARD\nyou can do so by website\nor text:\nJustGiving Page:\nhttps://www.justgiving.\ncom/forwarduk\nText Donation: Text\n\u201cFWRD30 \u00a3\u201d to 70070\nwith the donation amount\nafter the \u00a3\nFGM is rooted in cultural practices // Flickr\nFGM and raising aware-ness.

The\ncommunity programme\nworks with both men\nand women to train them\nto become community\nleaders and work with\ntheir own community to\ntackle FGM.\nWhat more is needed to bring FGM to a\nhalt?\nIt is clear what an awful\nact FGM now is and what\na severe impact it can\nhave on others.

    "content": "Outlying Islands: A Dark Exploration of Isolation\nT\nhe King\u2019s Head\nTheatre is a\ncharming location in Islington\nfronted by an eccen-tric-looking, cosy pub.\nWalking past the bar- after\ncollecting an essential\nbeverage- takes you to the\nsmall and intimate thea-tre, already full of tipsy\npatrons; this jovial atmosphere was truly a highlight\nof the experience. It was,\nhowever, in stark contrast\nto the themes of the play\nitself.\nOutlying Islands\nfollows the story of two\nyoung ornithologists,\nRobert (Tom Machell) and\nJohn (Jack McMillan),\nwho travel to the Outer\nHebrides, at the wish\nof the Ministry, aiming\nto study the birds that\npopulate a remote island.\nThey spend a month in\nthis lonely place with no\ncompany outside of the\nisland\u2019s leaseholder (Ken\nDrury) and his niece,\nEllen (Rose Wardlaw). In\nsuch complete isolation,\nthe play ruminates on the\nexpectations of society,\nsexuality, patriotism and\nthe raw power of nature.\nImmediately, the\naudience feels the remoteness of the island and its\ninhabitants through the\nclever staging. Light is an\nimportant and effective\ntool to this end, illuminating only part of the stage\nat a time and oftentimes\nmimicking only the weak\nglow of the lamp that\nlights the abandoned\nchapel where Robert and\nJohn must stay. Sound\nis also vital. It is used\nthroughout the performance to create the sense\nof a cold wind and this,\nalong with the smoke that\npervades the scene, draws\nthe audience in to that\nsame sense of unfamiliarity and coldness. Overall,\nthe experience is nothing\nshort of immersive.\nIn this intimate setting,\nthe inhabitants find that\n\u2018some force pulls\u2019 and\nthe island slowly claims\ntheir minds. The civilised\nmanner of John is tested\nrepeatedly by the tactless\nand carefree nature of\nRobert. There is tangible\ntension between the\npair on more than one\noccasion, pitting societal\nnorms directly against\nnatural instinct. In this\nway, Robert\u2019s character\nis particularly interesting and in little time, it\nbecomes clear than he will\ndo as he pleases based\npurely on animal desire.\nHe voices his envy of the\nbirds he studies, commenting that \u2018they allow\nthemselves to be taken\u2019\nand through this, his want\nof freedom is painfully\nclear. He also holds quite\nvenomous opinions\nagainst humanity and\nstresses that nature should\nbe protected from human\ndestruction, obviously far\nmore at home amongst\nthe birds than with other\npeople.\nAs the narrative pro-gresses, both Robert and\nEllen become increasingly\nreckless, throwing away\nall regard of what may be\nconsidered proper. Primal\ndesire drives them both\nand John is openly afraid\nof these developments, as\nhe is driven by genuine\nand honest feeling; again,\nopposition between\nexpectations and fancy.\nAll four characters of\nthe play repeatedly refer\nto the island as a \u2018pagan\nplace\u2019 and perhaps this\naccounts for the apparent\ncorruption of their minds.\nOutlying islands is\na heavy performance,\nlittered with dark tones\nand uncomfortable sce-narios. Although this can\nbe considered off-putting\nfor an audience, the tale\nis a powerful one and\nit\u2019s telling, powerful\nalso. More generally, the\ntheatre is a wonderful one\nand if this review hasn\u2019t\npiqued your interest then\nI leave you with one more\nfact: The King\u2019s Head has\nthe largest selection of ice\ncream of any theatre in\nLondon.\nImprobable fiction upon a stage\nT\nhe charming\nambience of\nS o u t h w a r k\nPlayhouse greets\nus with a charismatic mixture of bar, flexible theatre\nspace and creativity hub.\nIt is clear that this venue\nwants to break conven-tion. Getting access to the\nperformance room means\nexchanging a ticket for a\nwristband, gliding past a\nrainbow of hanging cloth\nstrips, finding a seat in a\nsquare arena to the sound\nof electronic drones and\nchatting to the cast while\nwaiting for everyone\nto settle in. All set for\na \u201cmusic-festival-like\u201d\nwelcome to the party-hard\nland of Illyria, where,\namidst some energetic\ndance moves, each\nactor introduces their\n(multiple) characters and\nthe accompanying outfit\nchanges. This was rather\nunnecessary: spelling out\neverything dumbs down\nthe audience.\nOften the background\nmusic or the shouting of\nother players is too loud\nto allow the words to be\nheard, and the clumsy\nattempts to introduce\nmodern songs that contrast\noddly with the archaic\nlanguage create an overall\nsense of displacement and\nlack of direction. Some\ndetails in the plot are over-looked, making it hard to\nunderstand circumstances\nand to follow later devel-opments. New as I am to\nthe world of Shakespeare,\nI only understood the\nrelationship between\nOlivia, the Duke and\nSir Toby, or the reasons\nthat led Viola to disguise\nherself as a man, upon\narriving home and reading\nrelevant Wikipedia pages.\nThe unexplained change\nin one character\u2019s gender,\nwith resulting language\nand context quirks,\nmakes a plot already full\nof cross-dressing and\nmistaken identities even\nmore muddled. And some\nmoments are purely dis-tasteful, with professional\nentertainers waving along\nto their own bad singing\nlike shy teenagers in a\nschool-day production.\nCredit must be given\nto a couple of features,\nthough. Fighting scenes\nare remarkably comic (I\nrefuse to spoil!), as are\nthe built-in interactions\nwith the public. Take a\nseat in the front row at\nyour own risk! I was just\none seat away from my\nshot at the stage and had\nto turn my neck a couple\nof times to face the actors.\nThe way misbehaving\nprops were dealt with was\nalso graciously comical,\nso much so that I was\nleft wondering if it was a\nreal accident or if I had\njust been fooled. Special\nmention to the inclusivity\nelement: one of the characters is mute, with others\nvoicing over. Actress\nCaroline Parker worked\nwith sign language interpreters to master this role.\nQuite a contrast, given\nher other character\u2019s\nviolent loquaciousness!\nHer all-around brilliant\nperformance clearly stole\nthe show at every chance.\nThe best of this\nproduction is really\nthe light-heartedness,\ncomical joy imbued in\nevery scene. After all\nthese years, and in the\nhands of competent\nactors, Shakespeare\u2019s wit\nkeeps making everyone\nlaugh.\nThe cast of Outlying Islands // Timothy Kelly\nISSUE 1711\nFELIX\n17\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe latest effort of King\u2019s Head Theatre is an intriguing and disturbing insight into human nature.\nARTS\nTesni HaddonMcmillan\nArts Writer\nWhere?

    "content": "ISSUE 1711\nFELIX\n6\nCOMMENT comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWho should vote on what?\nComment editor Charles Titmuss argues that voters are not to blame for poor political\noutcomes\nCOMMENT\nCharles Titmuss\nComment Editor\nThe Brexit vote has\nbeen in the zeitgeist\nfor the past month as\neverything comes to\na head. I humbly ask\nthe reader to cast their\nminds back to that rosy\nday on the 23rd of June\nwhen the nation voted\ninconclusively for something to do with Europe.\nAlthough much attention has been paid to\nthe way the nation voted\nand who voted for what,\nwe are still questioning\nwho exactly we should\nblame/ congratulate for\nthis political outcome.\nWinston Churchill\nonce said \u201cthe best\nargument against democracy is a five-minute\nconversation with the\naverage voter.\u201dAlthough\nwe shouldn\u2019t necessarily\nlisten to the words of\na saviour-of-the-na-t i o n - c u m - g e n o c i d -al-white-supremacist,\nthese words feel\nparticularly relevant\ntoday. In the present\nday we are bombarded\nby a constant stream\nof commercial and\npolitical propaganda,\nthat we accept or reject\nbased on our internal\nbiases. The merging of\ntruth and opinion into\na horrific parody of\nreality is something that\nwe encounter on a daily\nbasis. This is particularly dangerous in a political system that relies\non fact and truth as the\nfundamental political\ncurrency. One concept\nbandied around by Imperial\u2019s most obnoxious\nis qualified voting.\nQualified voting is\nthe concept that people\nshould only be granted\nthe vote if they satisfy\ncertain requirements.\nPrevious forms of qualified voting have been\nused deny people suf-ferage on the grounds of\nracial, social or sexual\ninferiority or that those\nwithout property had no\ninvestment in the nation\nand therefore no right\nto run it. In the modern\nday, qualified voting\nexists solely in the form\nof an age and citizenship metric. One must\nbe over 18 to exercise\nthe right to vote in the\nUK. This is justified\nbased on the claim that\nanyone below the age\nof 18 lacks the mental\ncapacity to comprehend\nthe complex issues of\nthe day, despite the fact\nthat the implications of\npolitical decisions taken\nmay have far more ramifications for them than\nsomeone older.\nThis raises the\nquestion, if intellectual\nmaturity is apparently of\nmost concern, should we\nrestrict the right to vote\nbased on intellectual\ncapability? Although I\nhave heard this question\nanswered in the affirmative by many of the\nparticularly insufferable\nmouth-breathers around\ncampus I do not believe\nthat this is an appropriate answer. For one\nthing there is the challenge of where exactly\nto politically amputate\nthe un-enlightened, and\nfor the other, there is\nthe question of morality.\nDiscriminating based on\nintellectual achievement\nrepresents a frightening\nextreme of meritocracy.\nJust because someone\nlacks intelligence does\nnot mean that they\nare not impacted by\ndecisions taken on their\nbehalf. They deserve\nthe right to vote for that\nreason alone.\nHowever, although\nI believe everyone has\nthe right to express\nan opinion I do not\nnecessarily believe that\nall opinions are created\nequal. Several disingenuous politicians, such as\nDavid Davis, have been\npedalling the idea that\neveryone is an expert.\nThis appeals to the individualist cult that we\nall happen to belong to\nnowadays, but in reality\nmost opinions matter\nabout as much as a whelk\nin a supernova. With the\nmedia cycle being a few\nhours at best, different\nhighly complex issues\nare birthed, discussed\nand then die so rapidly,\nthere is simply not\nenough time for individual voters to formulate a\nmeaningful overview of\nthe entire system. Therefore, there must be a\nreasonable solution that\nprevents misinformation\nand the misinformed\nfrom unduly impacting\ndemocracy without restricting voting access.\nI would argue that\nthe best solution to the\nproblem presented is to\nrestrict what people vote\nfor. Instead of the broad\nin/ out question that was\nposed to the electorate\nwith Brexit, it makes far\nmore sense to limit voter\noptions similarly to the\nprocess of voting for a\nparty in representative\ndemocracy. The options\nof mad, bad, sad, crazy,\nracist, commie, Scottie\nand Irish allow the voter\nto select a horse and bet\non it. This is in direct\nopposition to a blind,\nundefined leap in the\ndark, as was allowed\nto occur in the EU in/\nout referendum. Ambiguity was built into\nthe question as Remain\nassumed they would\nwin, and therefore would\nnever need to answer the\nquestion whilst Leave\nrequired the question to\nbe as simple as possible\nto unite the different\nBrexit factions to stand a\nchance of winning. This\nhas led us to the point\nwhere an unsatisfactory\ndeal has been negotiated\nby an unpopular Prime\nMinister. Only time\nwill tell if we crash out\nof the single market\nnot wearing a safety\nharness.\nTo return to the point\nof this article, clearly\ndefined objectives\nare a must in any life\nundertaking. Instead\nof debating an in/out\nquestion, it should have\nbeen carried out in a\nsimilar manner to a\ngeneral election, with\nmultiple campaigns\nproposing differing\noptions for the future\nrelationship with the\nEU. Defined objective\nreferenda have been\nshown to provide a\nsatisfactory outcome in\nmany legal independence campaigns (sorry\nCatalonia) as well as for\nisolated issues, such as\ngay marriage in Australia and abortion rights in\nIreland. Applying referenda to an obscure and\ncomplex issue such as\nthe extent of our membership with the EU was\ninappropriate and has\nonly served to provide\na confirmation of our\nlack of certainty of what\nour relationship with the\ncontinent is supposed to\nbe. No referendum at all\nwould have been better.\nFollow instructions to ensure your vote doesn\u2019t count // Flickr\n\n"

    "content": "Real men care about the environment\nT\noxic masculinity\nis currently a hot\ntopic, wearing\nmany guises \u2013\nthis was most recently\nhighlighted in the new\nGillette ad campaign on\nthe subject. This advert\nhas caused great contro-versy. resulting in many\npeople admonishing\nProctor and Gamble, for\nstanding up to toxic mas-culinity. Many people are\nalso threatening a boycott\nof their products, because\nthe idea that people (men,\nespecially) should take\naccountability for their\nactions is so offensive,\nobviously.\nI want to talk about how\nthis idea of masculinity\ntranslates into a general\ndisregard for the environment when it comes to\nmen. Now, don\u2019t get me\nwrong, I don\u2019t mean all\nmen. This is not an attack.\nThe way we are socialised\nto perform our genders has\nnegative consequences\nacross the board \u2013 but the\nenvironment is an aspect\nthat is often overlooked\nand could do with a little\nlight shed on it. A lot of\ntraditionally \u2018female\u2019\npractices are also terrible\nenvironmentally, but\nthat is another topic for\nanother time [see \u201cHow\nTrashy is your Period?\nFelix 1906\u201d].\nI have so many\nmemories of having very\none-sided conversations\nwith the men in my life\n- about recycling, eating\nless meat, or basically\nanything that would be of\na benefit to the environ-ment. And the problem\nis that they don\u2019t think\nthey should or need to\ncare, because that is what\nwomen do \u2013 care. Or at\nleast, that is what a lot of\npeople think.\nAgain, let me say this\nis not all men \u2013 but there\nhave been a number of\nstudies looking into this\nphenomenon. Men have\nbeen found to be more\nlikely to litter, recycle\nless, and have a larger\ncarbon footprint than\nwomen. This is all due\nto the \u2018green is feminine\u2019\nidea. Both men and\nwomen were found, in\na 2016 study by Brough\net al., to believe that\n2018: A big year for the vegan movement\nL\nast Tuesday (15th\nof January),\nEnvironmental\nSociety, VegSoc\nand APES collaborated\nto host a movie screening\nevent for the film VEGAN\n2018. Out of curiosity I\nattended. I came out of\nit feeling a mixture of\nemotions - partly overwhelmed by the density\nof the information, partly\nempowered to know that\nI could immediately start\nmaking small changes\nin my own lifestyle, and\npartly regretting that I\nhadn\u2019t attended more\nmovie screenings like\nthese.\nVEGAN 2018 introduced various aspects of\nthe explosive growth in\nveganism last year. An\nincreasing percentage of\npeople have begun to cut\nout meat from their diets\nand gradually incorporate\nmore environmentally\nfriendly ways of eating. In\nfact, especially around this\ntime of the year, people\nmay be participating in\nVeganuary - an event\nlaunched to encourage\neating a plant-based diet\njust for one month. The\nJanuaryof2018brokenew\nrecords with an estimated\n167 000 people taking\npart, grabbing a lot of attention from the media. In\nthe US, a company called\n\u2018Beyond Meat\u2019 carried\nout extensive research on\nproduct development of\nplant-based meat patties\n- in some regions of\nSouthern California their\nproducts were outselling\nactual meat patties.\nLondon is also a growing\nhub for vegetarian/vegan\ndiets, with vegetarian\noptions available in most\nrestaurants, and entire\nsections of major stores\nsuch as Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s dedicated to vegan/\nvegetarian meals. There\nis expanding research and\ndevelopment in producing\nmeat-free, \u2018mock meat\u2019\nproducts which could help\nsociety transition more\neasily into a plant-based\nlifestyle. The global\ntrend towards increasing\nawareness of veganism,\ncombined with influenc-ers (including athletes and\ncelebrities) promoting a\nplant-based diet meant\nmany businesses began to\nview this as an opportunity\nto incorporate it as part of\ntheir products. 2018 saw a\nsignificant improvement\nin the way mainstream\nindustries began to take\nup veganism.\nHowever, the film\nis perhaps overzealous\nwhen talking about\nthe imminent rise in\nveganism. Coming from\nan Asian background, I\nam also aware that the\nspread of veganism in the\nUK and US is certainly not\nrepresentative of the entire\nworld. Countries such as\nChina, Japan and many\nparts of South East Asia\nstill eat meat as a predominant proportion of their\nmeals. Vegetarian/ vegan\noptions are definitely not\nas readily available as it is\nin London. Therefore, it is\nimportant to acknowledge\nthat there is still a long\nway to go in terms of a\nglobal shift towards plant-based eating, that will take\nmany more years.\nNonetheless, getting\nthe opportunity to watch\nthis film undoubtedly\nmade me more aware\nthat every time we have\na meal, we are making a\nchoice - and for people to\nmake a choice, they must\nbe properly informed.\nFilm screenings like\nthese are an extremely\napproachable way to gain\nnew knowledge so that\nwe can make informed\ndecisions that have the\npotential to help the\nenvironment. If you\u2019re\ninterested in attending\nfuture screenings, make\nsure to keep up with the\nEnvironmental society on\nFacebook/Instagram, so\nas not to miss out on other\nfree events.\nSUSTAINABILITY\nSUSTAINABILITY\nMonami Miyamoto\nSustainability Editor\nFilm screening of VEGAN 2018 by APES, ESoc and Vegsoc gives food for thought\nSUSTAINABILITY\nFRIDAY, 25TH\nJANUARY, 2019 FELIX\nartur.donaldson15@imperial.ac.uk\nJessica-Lee Cole\nSustainability Writer\nmen engaging in \u2018green\u2019\nbehaviours were more\n\u2018feminine\u2019 than those that\ndidn\u2019t. This concept spills\nover into the perception\nof \u2018green\u2019 products \u2013 the\neco-friendlier version\nof a product was seen as\nmore feminine. This study\nalso looked into the way\nthat men who feel emasculated will compensate\nby engaging in behaviour\nthat is distinctly not\nenvironmentally-friendly.\nSo, undermining a man\u2019s\nmasculinity could result\nin direct harm to the envi-ronment.\nEver wondered why\nbrands bother to have a\n\u2018For men\u2019 line? There\u2019s\nactual science behind it!\nMen will preferentially\nchoose products that\nreaffirm their gender\nidentity over ones that\nare neutral or feminine.\nSo, one solution to this\nproblem is targeting men\nwith their own brand of\ngreen products and prac-tices.

Where\nwe will give you weekly\nguides on characters from\nNintendo\u2019s Super Smash\nBros. Ultimate, to give\nyou an overview and\nsome useful tips about\nthem. And who better than\nNintendo\u2019s golden boy to\nstart off this series, fighter\n#01 of the roster, Mario.\nN i n t e n d o \u2019 s\nmascot made his 1rst\nappearance as \u2018Jumpman\u2019\nin the classic arcade game\nDonkey Kong all the way\nback in 1981. Ever since,\nMario has remained Nintendo\u2019s most important IP\nand appeared in more than\n150 games of many different genres, ranging from\nplatformers, sports and\nof course fighting games.\nAs one of the original\n8 fighters from the first\nentry in Super Smash\nBros. on N64, Mario\u2019s\niconic character and\nplaystyle has remained\nconsistent throughout.\nHe is a powerful close\nrange brawler of medium\nweight and average speed\nwhich has plenty of perks.\nMario really\nexcels in hand to hand\ncombat and relies mostly\non his fast and reliable\nnormal, tilt and smash\nattacks to dish out the\ndamage and eventually\nsecure the kill. Living\nup to his former name of\n\u2018Jumpman\u2019, it is in the air\nthat he truly shines with\nan almost instant neutral,\nwhich you will be using\na lot, and a great up-air\nto juggle opponents with.\nAnd of course, Mario\u2019s\nbread and butter is his\nforward aerial, which\nwill spike down the poor\nplayer hit by it. Another\nstrong move of his kit is\nhis back-throw, which is\na powerful kill-throw at\nhigher percentages. In\naddition, this move will\nmake Mario spin around\nhitting any nearby op-ponents, handy if you\u2019re\ngetting attacked from\nmultiple angles!\nHis special moves\nare however not to be\nunderestimated as they\ngive him a huge amount\nof versatility. Mario\u2019s\nneutral special is his\ntrusty fireball, that will\ninterrupt the opponent,\nproviding the opportunity\nto chain in attacks or\ncombos, if followed upon\nquickly. His side special\nis his cape, very useful\nif timed right to reflect\nany projectiles. His down\nspecial is the F.L.U.D.D.,\na charged attack that can\nblast opponents with\nwater, it\u2019s purpose not to\ndo any damage but simply\nto push them away as\nthey are trying to recover.\nAnd last but definitely not\nleast, Mario\u2019s up special\nis his Super Jump Punch,\nwhich can of course be\nused as a recovery but\nalso as a kill-move for any\nopponent overhead.\nWith all this in mind, a\ncommon combo for Mario\ngoes as follows: throw\nyour enemy in the air\nwith an up-throw, -tilt or\n-smash, jump and hit them\nwith an up-air, repeat the\nprocess with a mid-air\njump and finish off with\nan up-special. Depending\non the weight and percentage of your opponent,\nit can lead to a kill. If not,\nall is not lost; you can\nalways go for the hefty\nFORWARD AERIAL\nwhile they are off stage to\nsend their poor soul down\ninto oblivion. Be sure to\nshout it when doing so for\nultimate disrespect.\nAll in all, Mario is a\nmid-high tier character\nwhich has a lot of po-tential. A fighter that is\neasy to learn, but hard to\nmaster, hence a good first\ncharacter to pick if you\nare new to Smash and\nwant to try it out.\nSmash Corner - Link, Mute Discount Legolas\nO\nriginating in\n1986 as the not\nso eponymous\nmain character\nof \u2018The Legend of Zelda\u2019,\nLink has grown to be\none of Nintendo\u2019s most\nbeloved and well-known\ncharacters. Long-time\nfans of Link finally get\ntheir justice in Ultimate\nas this is truly the best\niteration of Link we have\nhad yet! Link is one of the\nslower characters in the\ngame, but his high weight\nand kill power more than\nmake up for this. The key\nwith Link is to use his\nvariety of projectiles to\nforce your opponent into\na vulnerable position and\nthen blast them with your\nstrong, multi-hit up and\nforward smash attacks.\nThese moves have high\ndamage and large hitbox-es, meaning they are very\ngood at catching out the\nenemy as they try to avoid\nyour plethora of traps.\nLink\u2019s neutral special\nis his Bow and Arrow.\nIt is a great zoning tool\nwith moderate damage,\nscaling up the longer you\ncharge it. A good trick is\nto fire one at the ground\nand then pick it up, this\nlets your next shot fire 2\narrows simultaneously!\nUse the arrows to force\nyour opponent to jump\nand punish them with an\nanti-air.\nHis side special, Boomerang, can be thrown\nin a variety of angles\nand distances, filling a\nsimilar role to the arrows.\nHowever, the boomerang\nalso has a hitbox on the\nway back, providing\nadditional pressure as\nLink moves around the\nbattlefield. It can also be\nbounced off the ground,\nproviding many mix up\noptions to your playstyle.\nLink\u2019s up special and\nmain recovery option is\nSpin Attack. It can be\ncharged whilst on the\nground to deal a large\namount of damage on\nboth sides of Link, but\nwhere it really shines is\nthe large vertical distance\nthat can be covered with\nthis. Along with a jump,\nLink can now recover\nfrom almost anywhere off\nstage!\nThe bread and butter\nof Link\u2019s move set is his\ndown special, the Remote\nBomb. Using it creates a\nremote bomb which can be\ndetonated again with the\nsame input (as long as no\none is holding the bomb).\nThe possibilities with this\nmove are endless; you can\nuse it to hit and kill the\nenemy off stage or place it\non a platform to limit your\nopponent\u2019s movement\noptions. Alternatively, the\nbomb can be placed near\nthe ledge, forcing your\nopponent to jump from\nthe ledge which can then\nquickly be countered with\na forward or up aerial. If\nyou\u2019re feeling particularly\nfancy you can also use\nthe bomb to hit yourself\noff stage to add further\ndistance to your recovery.\nOther important things\nworth knowing are that\nwhen standing still, Link\nblocks projectiles with his\nHylian shield and when\nhis health is at 0% his\nforward smash also has\nits own projectile; a neat\ncall back to his original\ngames.\nI would place The Hero\nof Time securely in high\ntier, held away from top\ntier only by his unfavourable matchups against\nthe game\u2019s best such as\nPalutena and Pikachu.\nIf you want to learn\nmore about Link there\nare great videos by pro\nplayer \u2018ZeRo\u2019 and longtime Link main \u2018Izaw\u2019\non YouTube.

It\ndeals with three topics I\nam interested in: femi-nism, science, and history\n(and it is also available\nin the school library). In\ngeneral, each chapter\ncovers a controversial\ntopic such as: Are women\ninferior to men? Why do\nwomen live longer than\nmen? These chapters are\nself-contained and can be\nread separately.\nIn each chapter, Angela\nSaini listed the evidence\nsupporting both sides\nof each topic and made\nit easier for the public\nto understand scientific\nwriting in a smooth,\ncoherent, and story-telling\nway. Throughout her\nbook, Angela Saini emphasises on how little we\nknow about the behavior\nand biology of men and\nwomen.\nAngela Saini has a\ndegree in engineering\nand is currently a science\njournalist. Her first book\nwas published in 2011:\nGeek Nation: How Indian\nScience is Taking Over the\nWorld. She began writing\nher new book when her\neditor asked her to write\nabout the menopause.\nWhat is the evolutionary\nfunction of the menopause\nand why is it that only a\nfew species, such as killer\nwhales and humans, experience it? What interested\nher was how the gender\nof the scientist would\nmake them lean towards\ndifferent interpretations\nof this question. In her\nresearch, she noticed that\nmale scientists were more\nsupportive of the male\nsexual selection: females\nhave menopause because\naged females are not\nsexually attractive in the\neyes of the males. Female\nscientists were more supportive of the explanation\nthat menopausal females\nhave strong societal roles\nand were needed to help\nwith the survival of family\nmembers.\nSimilar bias in the\nstudy of sexual behaviors\nwere described in the\nbook. Saini explored\nwhether such behaviors in\ndifferent animals could be\nextrapolated to humans.\nSome male scientists\nbelieve that in many\nspecies, males are promiscuous while females are\nmonogamous by nature.\nOne of their explanations\nis that females need to\nspend more effort and\ntime for their offspring\nthan males, so they need\nto be picky about their\nmates. However, such\nviews were challenged by\ndata from other species.\nAngela Saini interviewed\nthe anthropologist Sarah\nB. Hardy, who observed\nthat female Hanuman\nlangurs mate with many\nmales to trick them into\nthinking they are the father\nof her offspring, and thus\nstopping the male langurs\nfrom killing the offspring\nthey did not father.\nIn October last year,\nSaini gave a talk at the\nNatural History Museum\non the \u2018Missing Half of\nScience\u2019 as part of the\nNHM Lates programme.\nShe shared her views on\nwhy fewer women are\nin science than men. She\nmentioned that women\nhave been working in\nscience for a very long\ntime, but they were not\ngiven proper credit for\ntheir work. During the\n19th century, most of\nthem had to work with\nfamily members and\ntheir publications were\ndiscredited if their names\nwere on it. Some were\nnot paid for their work.\nShe also mentioned that\nthere are more women in\ncertain fields of science\nsuch as life sciences and\nanthropology because\nmale scientists of those\nfields encouraged women\nto enter years before other\nfields.\nTo encourage young\nfemale scientists, she\nsuggested that the education system should\nlead students to think\nabout the causes of the\nimbalance of female role\nmodels in history and why\nwomen were excluded.\nOne of these causes were\ndescribed in her book\n- societal perspectives\nhave a large impact on\nscience. Angela Saini\nlooked through the letters\nand publications in the\n19th century, including\nones written by Charles\nDarwin on women being\nintellectually inferior to\nmen. Members of the\nscientific communities of\nthe time believed women\ncould not achieve as\nmuch as men because\nthis was in their biology.\nInterestingly, the late 19th\ncentury was also when the\nfirst feminist movement\nbegan. Feminists argued\nthat women could not\nachieve as much as men\nthen because they did not\nhave the opportunities\nto be educated and were\nrestricted by patriarchal\nsocietal structures and\nculture.\nGender is not the only\nbias in science. Saini will\nfurther explore how other\nsocietal factors such as\nracism, colonialism, and\naboriginal practices shape\nscience in her next book\nSuperior: The Return of\nRace Science, which will\nbe published in May this\nyear.\nAngela Saini shared her views on the new research that is rewriting the story of gender in her new book Inferior:\nHow Science Got Women Wrong and the New Research That\u2019s Rewriting the Story.\nAngela Saini shares her views at the NHM Lates // Hiu Wai Lee\nBOOKS\nFRIDAY, 25TH\nJANUARY, 2019 FELIX\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n25\nScience fiction authors come to Imperial!\nO\nn 16th February,\nthe Imperial\nC o l l e g e\nScience Fiction\nand Fantasy society will\nbe holding their 36th\nPicocon, a yearly convention and celebration of\nscience fiction and fantasy\nmedia. This year\u2019s theme\nis \u2018intrigue\u2019, and three science fiction authors will\nbe in attendance as Guests\nof Honour.\nAndrew Bannister is\nrenowned for his spectacular Spin Trilogy, the third\nbook of which (Stone\nClock) was published\nvery recently. The Spin\nTrilogy is Space Opera at\nits finest \u2013 the series has\nrepeatedly been compared\nto Iain M Banks\u2019 Culture\nSaga \u2013 high praise indeed,\nand well deserved. Bannister\u2019s talk at Picocon is\nset to be equally interest-ing, and you will not want\nto miss it.\nSimon Morden is also\ncoming to Picocon and\nhas a huge back catalogue of excellent books\nyou may have read. My\nown personal favourites\ninclude last year\u2019s One\nWay \u2013 leaving me very\nexcited for the release of\nthe sequel, No Way, just\none week after Picocon\n\u2013 and Arcanum, which\nis in fact more historical\nhigh fantasy than science\nfiction as such. Arcanum\nis without a doubt the\nbest historical fantasy\nnovel I\u2019ve read. Morden\nhas said he will focus his\ntalk on the topic of \u201cspace\nlaw\u201d and it promises to be\nexcellent.\nThe third guest, Gavin\nSmith, is best known for\nhis Bastard Legion series,\nalthough you may also\nknow him for some of\nhis very good video game\ntie-in novels for games\nsuch as Crysis 3 and\nELITE: DANGEROUS.\nThe Bastard Legion is\na military science fiction\nseries which very much\nran the risk of just being\nanother generic space\nmarine series, but which\nmanages instead to be an\nincredibly successful and\nwell-written subversion\nof the genre. Following\nthe adventures and misfortunes of an incredibly\nselfish and morally grey\ncharacter as opposed to\nyour typical saint-like\nprotagonist, the series\nprovides a very refreshing\nchange of pace.\nPicocon 36: Intrigue\npromises to be a brilliant\nday, and if you want to\ncatch the speeches of each\nof these guests of honour,\nas well as another given\nby a game-developer\nduo (and plenty more\nbesides), you should get\nyourself a ticket! The\nday\u2019s events will be held\nmostly in Blackett\u2019s\nLecture Theatre 1 (LT1).\nBOOKS\nHarry Black\nBooks Writer\nPicocon 36: Intrigue will see three renowned sci-fi authors come to Imperial\n\n"

The consultations revealed that most\npeople interact only with a\nsmall area of the campus\nat which they are already\nbased, and are unfamiliar\nwith the College grounds\nbeyond that. This is an\nimbalance that will be\naddressed by making the\nshared spaces between\nbuildings more accessible\nand appealing, to allow all\nparts of the campus to be\nenjoyed by all people.\nProjects in the Masterplan vary in terms of\nimpact, ease of implemen-tation, and investment.\nThe short-term projects\ninclude the development\nof the Sherfield Walkway.\nThe consultations revealed the difficulty of\nmoving around campus,\nwith part of the problem\ncoming from the narrow\nSherfield Walkway, which\nbecomes heavily congested during peak hours of\nthe day. The Masterplan\ninvolves opening up\nthe Walkway and other\nroutes, increasing space\nand better access, and\nadding improved signage.\nThe Queen\u2019s Lawn\nhas long been thought\nof as the heart of the\ncampus, and steps have\nalready been taken as\npart of another short-term\nproject to improve the\nspace. The new Dangoor\nPlaza will be a courtyard\nthat stretches across the\nSherfield Building and the\nSkempton Building area,\nwhere Queen\u2019s Lawn currently spans. The Dangoor\nPlaza is planned to be a\nwelcoming green space\nwith areas for campus\nactivities year-round. The\nfunding for this project has\nbeen generously provided\nby the Dangoor family\u2019s\nExilarch\u2019s Foundation.\nWohl Reach Out Lab.\nThough opening up\nspace in public realms is\nclearly central to the Masterplan, other improvements to shared spaces are\nalso included. Improved\nfinishes are considered for\nDalby Court and Sherfield\nWalkway; spaces that\nare arrival points for the\npublic, such as Imperial\nCollege Road and the\nMain Entrance, will be\nreimagined to enforce a\n\u201csense of arrival into the\ncampus with a feeling of\nwelcome\u201d. It considers\nthe development of Imperial College Road into a\nprimarily pedestrian area,\nas opposed to the vehicle\ndominated space that it\ncurrently is, which would\nallow it to be a potential\nspace for the weekly\nFarmer\u2019s Market and the\nImperial Festival.\nThe long-term projects\ninclude developments to\nthe Chemistry Building,\nthe Sherfield Building,\nand expanding the Main\nEntrance.\nNeil Alford, Associate\nProvost (Academic\nPlanning), states, \u201cThe\nMasterplan is an ambition.\nIt\u2019s a vision for the best\nversion of the campus we\ncan imagine. We shelve\nconsiderations of cost and\nother practicalities for a\nmoment, and just think\nabout what we\u2019d really\nwant our campus to look\nlike. This then provides a\nframework that helps us\nas we move forward with\nour development plans for\nthe campus as investment\nbecomes available.\"\nThose who would\nlike to submit feedback\nregarding campus plans\nmay do so on the College\nwebsite South Kensington\nMasterplan page.\nArtist Impression of Dangoor Plaza // Imperial College London\n\u201cThe\nincreasing\nCollege\npopulation\nhas led to\nevaluations of\nhow the South\nKensington\ncampus should\nbe refined to\naccommodate\nthis growth\u201d\n\u201cA masterplan\nof the future\nof the South\nKensington\nCampus\nhas been\ndeveloped\u201d\nCancer Awareness in Young People Week (CAYP)\nNEWS\n29th January - 3rd February 2019\nFilippa Furniss\n1st\nTeam Captain Imperial\nCollege Netball Club\nI\nmperial College\nNetball Club\n(ICUNC) have\nteamed up with\nsocieties across Imperial\nto bring you a week jam\npacked with events, with\neverything from talks on\ncancer symptoms (de-livered by our very own\nstudents) to an infamous\nACC night (did someone\nsay Snakebite?) with\nan ICUNC twist. The\nweek is all about getting\neducated on cancer\nsymptoms, how to check\nfor them and when is a\ngood time to pootle on\ndown to your GP just to\nget it checked out. We\nwant to get rid of the\ntaboo of cancer chats, it\ndoesn\u2019t have to be scary\nor sad, it can be simple\nand light hearted too!\nyou never really talk to\nor a school teacher you\ncan\u2019t really remember;\nsometimes it\u2019s a bit closer\nto home - a grandparent,\na family friend, maybe a\nparent. Regardless of who\nit is, that doesn\u2019t change\nthe irremovable fact that\nthe C-word is one of\nthose things that everyone\nlowers their voices about,\nand can only be discussed\nwith sombre tones and sad\nexpressions.\nI know that, because\nthat\u2019s what happened to\nme. But rather unexpect-edly, it wasn\u2019t a random\nfamily friend. It was\nLauren. Andy, our lovely\nEditor-in-Chief, wrote\nabout Lauren Dennis\nback in October, just after\nshe passed away after an\n18-month fight with small\nbowel cancer. Lauren\nwas my best friend, my\nhousemate, and probably\nthe best Goal Keeper our\nnetball team had acquired\nin many MANY years\n- she\u2019d disagree but it\u2019s\ntrue.\nLauren was 23 when\nshe passed away.\nI didn\u2019t really know\nanything about cancer\nbefore she was diagnosed.\nI knew the basic stuff that\neveryone knew about:\nlumps are bad, you lose\nyour hair, and the treatment is called chemo? But\nI knew next to nothing\nabout the breadth of\ncancer, not a clue about\nwhat symptoms would\nmanifest themselves as,\nlet alone how to check for\nthem!\nEarly detection of\nnearly all types of cancer\nincreases survival rates.\nWhen I did the research,\nthe statistics were stagger-ing:\nMore than 9 in 10\nbowel cancer patients\nwill survive the disease\nfor more than 5 years if\ndiagnosed at the earliest\nstage.\nMore than 90% of\nwomen diagnosed with\nbreast cancer at the earliest stage survive their\ndisease for at least 5 years\ncompared to around 15%\nfor women diagnosed with\nthe most advanced stage\nof disease.\nIt seems mind blowing\nthat these statistics exist,\nyet I\u2019ve still never heard\nanyone telling their pals\non the bus about how they\nchecked their boobs for\nlumps last night, or they\nwent to see their GP just\nto figure out that unexplained weight-loss.\nThe answer is simple:\nLet\u2019s talk about it. Let\u2019s\ntalk about our bodies,\nlet\u2019s talk about any weird\nthings we notice, and let\u2019s\ntalk to our GPs. Then\nmaybe that nightmare\ndiagnosis doesn\u2019t have to\nend in hushed conversa-tions, and sad glances at\nyou every day, but instead\npopping champagne at\nthat last clean scan, and a\nlong, happy, healthy life.\nSo how can you get\nworthwhile charities.\nGiving to charity and\npints?

    "content": "ISSUE 1711\nFELIX\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n11\nThe (Oscars\u2019) Favourite\nFilm Writer Rowan Dixon reviews The Favourite, a serious awards contender. Are mainstream critics wrong about\nthis seemingly subversive historical drama?\nT\nhe Favourite is\na miss-match\nof fish eye vid-eography, royal\nlesbian sex, aristocratic\nduck racing and some\nkickass wheelchairs. This\nfilm is quite simply all\nabout who Queen Anne\u2019s\nbest friend is, battled out\nbetween Sarah Churchill,\nthe queen\u2019s longest and\nclosest friend, and Abigail\nMasham, a servant from\nwhat was a rich and\npowerful family. Through\na mix of gentle verbal\nmanipulation, oral sex and\ngood old-fashioned lying,\nMasham works her way up\nfrom being a simple servant to being a close friend\nof the Queen. This causes\nfriction with Churchill,\nwho is effectively running\nthe country for Anne and\nhas devoted her life to\nserving her. Anne, as we\ndiscover over the course\nof the film (or if you\u2019re\na history buff already\nknow), has had an incredibly unfortunate life. She\nhas had at least 17 preg-nancies, most ending in\nmiscarriages, and the very\nfew that were born died\nwithin a few months. To\nfill this gap she has many\nrabbits, 17 to be exact,\nwho live in her bedroom\nand occasionally steal\nthe show away from the\nmain characters. Whilst\nthe queen is in mental\nbreakdown and Masham\nand Churchill battle out\nwho is The Favourite,\nthere is a war going on\nbetween England and\nFrance, which coincidentally is being organised by\nChurchill\u2019s husband.\nYet despite strong\nacting talent, the film is\nlet down by its script. The\ndialogue is slow and all\nthe jokes end up falling\nflat on their face, literally\nin one case. The saving\ngrace of this film, and the\nonly reason I didn\u2019t walk\nout, was Rachael Weisz\u2019s\ncharacter, Sarah Churchill. Sarah is one badass\ncharacter; she is running\nthe country, has multiple\npoliticians in her pocket\n\u201c...the acting is\nvery good and\nthe costumes\nare exceptional\nbut I can\u2019t\nget my head\naround how\ndull it is.\u201d\n\u201c... she is\nrunning the\ncountry, has\nmultiple\npoliticians in\nher pocket and\nis one hell of a\ngood shot all\nwhilst having\na perfectly\ntwisted sense\nof humour.\u201d\nand is one hell of a good\nshot, all whilst having a\nperfectly twisted sense\nof humour. Weisz\u2019s performance is perfect, she\ndominates the screen and,\ndare I say, gives a better\nperformance than Olivia\nColeman. That\u2019s not to\nsay Colman\u2019s portrayal\nof Queen Anne is poor,\nfar from it\u2014 Coleman\nplays the part of the\nemotionally unstable and\nchildish monarch in a very\ndramatic manner, which\nat times is so dramatic it\u2019s\nalmost amusing to watch.\nYou may have noticed by\nnow that there is a theme\ngoing on\u2013 no men. That\u2019s\nnot to say there aren\u2019t any\nmale roles (there are), but\nthey have been delegated\nto the comical roles and\nalways have an air of\nincompetence. They are\nalways running around\nafter the matriarchs of the\nfilm, wearing \u2018silly\u2019 wigs\nand covered in powder\nmakeup, subverting the\nhistorical views of 18th\ncentury society.\nWriting this review\nwas hard. On one hand\nthe acting is very good\nand the costumes are\nexceptional but I can\u2019t\nget my head around how\ndull it is, and to make it\neven harder I can\u2019t point\nmy finger at any specific\nfault, which leads me to\nconclude that my 2 hours\nof boredom was due to the\nscript. I know the script\nhas already been partially\ndictated by history, but\nthere are so many wonderful historically accurate\nfilms out there that are\nsuch a joy to watch that\nI really can\u2019t understand\nwhy this made me want to\nleave the cinema and take\nthe hit on my \u00a37.99 ticket.\nThat money could have\nbeen spent on something\nmuch better, like any other\nfilm I have seen in the\npast year, and I watched\nThe Room\u2026. If you have\nmade it this far through\nthe review then by now\nyou shouldn\u2019t need me\nto tell you to save your\nmoney and go to KFC\ninstead, but just in case,\ndon\u2019t bother watching it!\nThe only reason I would\nrecommend this film to\nanyone is if you want to\nhear some swearing, and\nyou get that for free and\nin much more abundance\nin the street. There is the\nfact that it is pretty historically accurate in the broad\nsense, but what exactly\nwent on inside the walls\nof the palace and how\nlong some guys last whilst\nbeing jacked off on their\nwedding night is anyone\u2019s\nguess. If you want to\nwatch a historical film\nthen there are hundreds\nout there which are\nmuch more exciting and\nenjoyable to watch, but if\nyou want to know more\nabout the early 1700s save\nyourself 120 minutes and\njust google it.WW\nAt least the costumes deserve their awards recognition. // IMDb\nFILM\nRowan Dixon\nFilm Writer\nDir: Yorgos Lanthimos.\nScript: Deborah Davis,\nTony McNamara Starring:\nOlivia Coleman, Rachel\nWeisz, Emma Stone.\n120 minutes\nTHE FAVOURITE\n\n"

    "content": "Are we nearing the last stages of the Apple wave?\nApple sells fewer iPhones every year despite consistent revenue growth\nTECH\nKrithika Balaji\nTech Editor\nA\npple - the one\nphone brand\ne v e r y b o d y\nknows. Even\nif you haven\u2019t owned an\nApple product in the past\ndecade, you have probably\nseen somebody in Hyde\nPark taking a selfie with\ntheir new iPhone XR or\nthe person sitting next to\nyou in the library on their\nMacBook Air. Ever since\n2007, Apple has enjoyed\na wonderful decade as the\nKing of Smartphones after\nusurping Nokia for that\ntitle. Indeed, Apple was\none of the driving forces\nbehind the smartphone\nboom in the market,\nmaking it a household\nname. For the past couple\nof years, however, the\nsmartphone market\nstarted to stagnate, which\nposed a problem for many\nphone companies. Apple,\nhowever, seemed to defy\nthe trends by showing a\nsteady growth in revenue.\nAnd yet, two weeks ago,\nthe company \u201cstunningly\nslashed its own revenue\nforecast for its first fiscal\nquarter that ended in\nDecember\u201d, resulting in a\nstock plunge of 10% - the\nworst the company had\never seen in six years.\nIt was revealed that,\ndespite the continual\nrevenue growth over the\nyears, Apple had actually\nbeen selling fewer and\nfewer iPhones. The reality\nis that Apple saw a peak in\niPhone unit sales in 2015\nand that Apple sold 14\nmillion fewer phones than\nit did three years ago. One\nmight ask - how was there\nrevenue growth if fewer\nmodels were sold? The\nanswer - hiked prices.\nTechnology always\ngets cheaper over time.\nIn 1984, Motorola sold\nthe first mobile phone for\n$4000, whereas now the\naverage price of a handset\nis $320, according to IDC,\na research firm. Apple,\nhowever, bucked the\ntrend. To hide its stagnating growth, they hiked up\nthe prices for the newer\niPhone models to continue\ngenerating revenue. Due\nto their loyal fan base,\nthis stalling tactic was\nsucessful. However, it is\nclear that there is only so\nmuch they can hike up\nthe prices. Realistically,\nwould you be willing to\npay $1,500 or $2,000 for\nan iPhone when you can\nalso get a smartphone\nthat\u2019s much cheaper with\nthe same functionalities\nfrom Samsung or Vivo?\nLast November, they\nsaid that they will not be\nreleasing unit sales figures\nanymore, which is very\nindicative of exactly how\nhot the water they have-landed up in is.\nThe company blamed\n\u201ca slow economy in\nChina and the trade\nskirmish with the U.S.\nfor worse-than-expected\nconsumer transactions in\nthe region that includes\nChina, Taiwan and Hong\nKong\u201d. CEO Tim Cook\nalso told stockholders in\na letter that iPhone sales\nwere on a decline due to\nchanges in the smartphone\nmarket and consumer\nbehaviour - information\nthat should have been\nalready own old iPhone\nmodels and will upgrade\nby buying the latest\none on the market. This\nwas attributed to many\nfactors, such as: economic\nweakness in some coun-tries, people using their\nsmartphones for longer\nperiods of time due to the\nhalt in subsidies from the\nmobile phone companies,\nthe rising iPhone prices\nand the lower-cost battery\nswaps, slowed down\neconomic conditions in\nChina in the second-half\nof 2018 and the shopping\ntraffic being hurt by the\nuncertainty surrounding\nthe U.S.-China trade war,\ndespite Apple claiming\nSales for Apple have been slowing down //apple\nTECH\nFRIDAY, 25TH\nJANUARY, 2019 FELIX\ntecfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n10\ntwo months ago that\nApple\u2019s China business\nwas \u201cvery strong\u201d.\nIt is important to note\nthat this doesn\u2019t mean\nthat Apple is currently\ncrashing and burning,\nas it is obvious from\ngrowth charts that they\nare generating enough\nrevenue and cash-flow to\nbe envied by anyone in\nthe corporate world. What\nit does mean, however,\nthat Apple broke the \u201cNo.\n1 rule of being a public\ncompany\u201d - honesty and\nopenness with investors\nabout the progress of the\nbusiness - and so, in the\ncoming year, will have to\nface the consequences.\n\u201cApple sold 14\nmillion fewer\nphones than it\ndid three years\nago.\u201d\nconveyed ahead of time\nto investors.
