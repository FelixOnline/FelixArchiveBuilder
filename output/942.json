    "content": "Reviews\n1 5th October 1992 Felix 942 I Books Escher \u2014The Complete\nGraphic Works\nComplete\nReaper by Graham Hurley\nThe IRA are planning revenge.\nSomething big, something\nunexpected in order to make the\nBrits sit up and think about the ten\nmen that they let die in the Hunger\nStrikes. Reaper is the mind behind\nit all. Out for their blood are MI5,\nthe RUC, 19th Army Intelligence\nand every other British intelligence\nagency. It doesn't help that they are\nagainst each other as well. Dragged\nforcefully into all this is Buddy\nLittle, who determined to somehow\nfind new life for his beautiful but\ncrippled wife. I found that the book\nwas well written, with new and\ninteresting characters becoming\ninvolved in the plot as the story\nmoves on. It puts a new light upon\nthe IRA showing them to be clever\nas well as ruthless, with a fierce\nlove for their country. I recommend\nthat you read this book and add little\ninterest to your time.\nGB H. This book claims to contain all of\nM.C. Eschers paintings and\ndrawings, and by the huge number\nof pictures within its covers, I can\nwell believe this. It is truly a wonderful anthology of all of his\nworks, and as an Escher fan. I found it hugely interesting. The\naccompanying text covers his life as\nwell as the drawings themselves; all\nthis being broken into useful\nchapters in a chronological order,\nencompassing his travels and\nworking life giving an insight into\nthis master of perspective.\nThe book is in portfolio form\nwith a paperback cover. It is fairly\nexpensive for a paperback, but the\nquality of reproduction of all the\n600+ prints is very commendable,\nseveral (36) being in full colour. If\nyou are interested in Escher prints\nthen this is the present def i native work of his work and is well worth\nthe investment here. Brilliant.\nAlex\nHUMANITIES PROGRAMME199293 EVENING LANGUAGE CLASSES Open to all members of Imperial College FRENCH from Near-Beginners to Advanced\nGERMAN from Beginners to Advanced\nITALIAN* Beginners and Intermediate\nSPANISH* Beginners and Intermediate\nAdvanced classes will be run in Italian and Spanish\nif sufficient numbers enrol.\nENROLMENT You can enrol from the beginning of September in Room 320, Mech.

It's a wonderful\ndescription. Venice and Alabama\nare two sisters who live at opposite\nends of the London scene.\nDevastating Venice, having been\nfired from her third job in a month,\ndecides that she would simply have\nto find a sugar daddy!\nThe CIA\u2014A History by John\nRanelagh\nAfter reading this book I am sad\nthat I missed the BBC series of the\nsame title. For someone like myself\nwho knew nothing on the subject of\nthe CIA, I now feel that I can hold\nmy own in any discussion regarding\nthem. It starts from the very basics,\nthe very beginning and goes\nthrough to record the events that\nlead them to become the\norganisation that they are today.\nThe author has assumed that his\nreaders have no current knowledge\nof the CIA workings which made\nAlabama, the hard working\nplay write, falls for Max, a young\nactor, whom she discovers in\nCroydon. Obviously a party is\ncalled for and Oliver is the man to\nthrow it.\nBut do the sisters know what they\nreally want, and why are there very\nfew places in London that really\nknow how to make a Bloody Mary?\nI loved this book - go and read it\nnow!\nToby Jones.\nthe book very simple to read. The\nbook has been divided into blocks\nof years which Mr. Ranelagh\nobviously thought played very\nimportant roles in the forming of the\nCIA and in these sections has also\ndescribed what was occur ing in the\nrest of the world - helpful for those\nof us whose history is rather weak\nin places. For anyone with even a minimal interest in the workings of\nthe secret services world wide, I would recommend this book. It was\ninformative, enlightening and\ngenerally an all round good read.\nD BC. Tokaido by Lucia St Clair\nRobson\nSet in the time of Old Japan, the\nstory is about Lady Asano, the\ndaughter of Lord Asano who was\ndisgraced into committing ritual\nsuicide. Lady Asano sets off on a journey down the Tokaido Road to\nKyoto, to find her fathers old\nlieutenant, seeking revenge on her\nfathers enemy..\nHowever, I found that the book\nwasn't just another revenge story.\nIt shows the change of Lady\nAsano's character from a proud and\npretentious samurai, to a cleverer\nand more humble person. She\nchanges from being a respected\ncourtesan to a hunted runaway, who\ndisguises herself as a disciple, a pilgrim, a priest and a peasant as\nshe travels on.\nThe book is well written, with\npieces of Zen and other wise, old\nsayings dotted everywhere\nthroughout the book. It does,\nhowever, get tedious at times but it\nis still a book worth reading.\nGB H. The Rector's Wife by Joanna\nTrollope\nThis book was about how Anna\nBouvrie stu gg les against the\npre ji duce inflicted by the small\nparish in which she and her family\nlives. Her husband, the Rector,\nretreated into an isolated bitterness\nafter failing to gain his promotion.\nHer daughter, being constantly\nbullied at her school, caused Anna\nto re bell. She took a job in a local\nsupermarket in order to send her\ndaughter to a private school and\nescape the boredom of her home\nlife.\nThe new Anna was admired by\nthree men, newcomers to the\nparish, giving her the opportunity\nto explore her sexuality, something\nshe had been unable to do with her\nhusband.\nThe plot was of no particular\ninterest, to any one or anything, yet\nvaguely interesting. Not a book I would readily recommend to\nanyone, yet for a long train journey\nit'll do.\nFB F. Page 22\n\n"

    "content": "N ews\n5th October 1992 Felix 942\nImperial to be medical 'Super School'\nImperial College is set to become\none of four medical 'super schools'\nwithin the University of London.\nThe plan follows discussions at\nmeetings of the College Board of\nStudies and Governing Body\nExecutive Committee, and is\ndetailed in a document submitted by\nthe University of London to the\ngovernment appointed Tomlinson\nEnquiry. The Enquiry, under the\ndirection of Sir Bernard Tomlinson,\nis looking at the provision of health\ncare in London with a view to\nwidespread rational is ation. The centre piece of the 'super\nschool' plan is a possible merger\nbetween Imperial and the Charing\nCross Westminster Medical School,\ncurrently based at Charing Cross\nHospital in Hammersmith. This will\nbe the second medical merger in\nrecent times. In 1988, Imperial\nCollege of Science and Technology\nmerged with St. Mary's Hospital\nMedical School in Paddington to\nform the Imperial College of\nScience, Technology and Medicine.\nThe possibility of a merger with\nCharing Cross Westminster was\nfirst revealed in May this year by\nthe then Imperial College Union\npresident, Zoe Hellinger. Ms\nHellinger said at the time that she\nwould produce a report for college\nI \u2014 News in Brief\nGoverning Body, discussing 'the\nwider effects of this merger on\nstudents and the students' union'.\nThe author of the merger\nproposal is Professor Peter\nRichards, Pro-Rector of Medicine\nand Dean of St. Mary's. Professor\nRichards said in May that he had\nsubmitted a report to the College\nBoard of Studies on a possible\nmerger. Copies of the minutes of\nthe Executive Committee meeting\nof 20 March 1992 show that\nProfessor Richards had discussed\nthe prospect of a merger with the\nDean of Charing Cross\nWestminster Medical School in\nAugust 1991. Professor Richards is\nrecorded as saying that the pre-clinical staff of Charing Cross\nWestminster had agreed to the\nformation of a single unit on the\nSouth Kensington campus.\nProfessor Richards also added that,\nafter discussion with the Chief\nExecutive of the Universities\nFunding Council (UFC) and Sir\nBernard Tomlinson, it had been\nagreed to cover the cost of the\nmerger in part with funds raised by\nthe sale of buildings 'elsewhere'.\nA merger between Imperial and\nCharing Cross Westminster would\nresult in a medical school of 1,500\nstudents. This compares in number\nwith some 2,000 engineers and over\n1,700 scientists. Both Professor\nRichards and Sir Eric Ash, the\nCollege Rector, regard the move as\nImperial 'becoming the focus for\nmedical research and education in\nWest London'. The proposal to\nmerge is the basis of the submission\nby Imperial College to the\nTomlinson Enquiry. In a letter to\nSir Bernard Tomlinson, Sir Eric\nsays that the proposal to form an\nintegrated Medical School has 'been\naccepted in principle by the\nGoverning Bodies of Imperial\nCollege and Charing Cross\nWestminster Medical School.' Sir\nEric adds that 'it is our firm\nintention to work towards the\nformation of one integrated Medical\nSchool. We are confident that we\nwould succeed.'\nThe submission by Imperial is\npart of an overall submission by the\nUniversity of London to the\nTomlinson Enquiry, which was set\nup in October 1991. The then\nHealth Secretary, William\nWaldergrave, appointed Sir\nBernard Tomlinson as a special\nadvisor to the Departments of\nHealth and Education. Sir Bernard,\na former chairman of the Northern\nRegional Health Authority, was\nasked to advise on how health\nbodies were 'addressing the\nprovision of health care in London'\nwithin the framework of recent\nNHS reforms. He was specifically\ninstructed to take account of\nLondon's health needs, purchasing\nplans of local health authorities, and\nthe need to maintain high standards\nof medical teaching and research\nand development.\nThe University of London\ndocument details three other\nmergers between multi- faculty\ncolleges and medical schools. This\nis expected to lead to eight of\nLondon's nine medical schools\nbeing consolidated in four groups.\nThese groups would be focused on\nImperial in west London,\nUniversity College in north\nLondon, Queen Mary Westfield in\neast London, and Kings College\nLondon in south London. The\nUniversity of London document\nshows that University College is to\nmerge with the Royal Free Medical\nSchools, Queen Mary Westfield is\nto merge with the Medical Colleges\nof the London and Barts Hospitals,\nand Kings College is to merge with\nthe United Medical and Dental\nSchools of Guy's and St. Thomas's Hospitals.\nKer b crawling case dropped TW L Imperial College Students are to\nappear in the West End in a limited\nrun of the play 'Teechers'. The play\nis being staged by the Union\nsociety, 'Theatre West End'\n(TWE), and is a repeat of the\nproduction they staged in August at\nthe Edinburgh Festival. 'Teechers'\ncan be seen at the Bloomsbury\nTheatre, Gordon Street on Tuesday\nat 6.45pm and Friday at 4.30pm. Tickets are available from the box\noffice on 071 387 9629.\nCom mem Day The College will be closed on the\nafternoon of Thursday 22 October,\nfor the annual Commemoration Day\ncelebrations. All lectures will cease\nat 12 noon.\nRegistrar Peter Mee, the College Registrar,\nwill be available to see students on\nMondays during term time between\nl pm and 2pm. The Registrar, who\ndeals with a host of issues ranging\nfrom fees to visas to exams, can be\nfound on the third floor of the\nSherfield building in room 339.\nSpeaking to /'CNN, Mr Mee said\nthat he will see students who wish\nto discuss any matters, and that no\nappointment is necessary.\nInternational House The International Students'\nHouse has set aside a number of bed\nspaces for students looking for\npermanent accommodation.

The\nCrown Prosecution Service said that\nit was not in the public interest to\nprosecute. Professor Harris had\nbeen listed to appear before\nmagistrates on Tuesday.

You might\nwant to go back. Last year 130\nImperial students returned to the\nclassroom. They did not go as\npupils, nor as teachers. They were\ndifferent. They were Pimlico tutors.\nThey taught and learned. They\nlearned about interaction, about\ncommunication, about science. By\ngetting out of college, most tutors\nthought they had reinforced their\nknowledge of their subject. Over\n90% of these Imperial students felt\npractised in the communication of\nscientific ideas. Almost all felt they\nwere doing something useful with\ntheir subject.\nThese were Imperial's Pimlico\ntutors. Under the Pimlico\nConnection, Imperial students have\ngone back into classrooms right\nacross London since 1975. The\nPimlico Connection has been\nwidely acclaimed. The\n'Independent' tells us that 'student\ntutors have livened up lessons for\npupils in London'. Pimlico tutors\nhave been called 'pioneers in the\nappliance of science', 'role model\nstudents' and 'fuel for staying\npower'.\nWorking individually or in small\ngroups, the tutors assist teachers in\nlocal secondary and primary\nschools. In almost all cases, this is\ndone on Wednesday afternoons for\nbetween one and two terms. The\ntutors provide extra help within a class, working under the direction\nand supervision of the class teacher.\n'It's not a case of being thrown in\nat the deep end,' says Chris Riley,\na former tutor. 'Tutoring does not\nmean looking after a class of\nbetween 20 and 30 children single\nFelix942 handed.'\nStudents, pupils and teachers all\ntell of the benefits of tutoring.\nTutoring is also seen as a method\nof promoting science and\ntechnology, and of increasing the\nnumbers of children staying on in\neducation after 16. Industry is also\nconvinced of the value of tutoring.\nIn 1990, BP appointed John Hughes\nas Fellow for Student Tutoring at\nImperial College, and charged him\nwith developing the scheme.\nThe organisation of student tutors\nat Imperial is done by the tutors\nthemselves. The Pimlico\nConnection is an Imperial College\nUnion society, run by an elected\n'eat ure5 th October1992 committee. This year's chairperson,\nAnita Ellis, says that tutors benefit\nfrom regular newsletters and\nsub sidi sed social events such as\ndinners and guest speakers. She\nadds that the committee provides 'a well defined back up in case\nproblems arise'.\nThe back up starts with training.\nThroughout Freshers' Week and the\nweek after, John Hughes will be\nrunning, no obligation training and\nbriefing sessions. The briefing\nsessions will tell you about the\nPimlico Connection. If you like\nwhat you hear, you can come back\nfor the training.\ncontinued next page.\nPage11 "

    "content": "A Gliding Tale\nIt's official\u2014Imperial College\nGliding Club is the best university\ngliding club in the country after\nsuccessfully capturing the inter-university shield from Cambridge\nUniversity. The competition was\nattended by seven college gliding\nclubs and was held at Saltby in\nLincolnshire. The soaring\nconditions were poor all week-typical inter-university task week\nweather.\nA week later and our splendid\nnew two seat glider was in action\nagain for the 1992 Lasham\nregional s, a nine day competition\nheld at our home airfield. Lasham\nin Hampshire. In the best soaring\nconditions of the year so far, many\nthousands of competition kilometres\nwere clocked up by the field of 50\ngliders.\nI now describe a flight made by\nmyself and Martin Judkins, and\nICGC instructor around a367 km task on 28th July\u2014a day to\nremember.\nThe day dawned clear and dry,\nand soon the temperature was\nclimbing rapidly. By 10am small\npuffs of cumulus cloud appeared\noverhead\u2014the ideal start to a super\nsoaring day. After attending the\ncustomary briefing we strapped\nourselves into the glider and in a short time we were airborne, being\ntowed to 2000 feet by the small tug\naeroplane. The air was turbulent\nand convective and after releasing\nthe tow rope we rapidly climbed to\ncloud base which was already at\n4000 feet and rising. The thermal\nlift was strong at 5 to 8 knots (1 knot\n= 100 feet per minute).\nWe started at 11.18am on the first\nleg of the task; Lasham to the\ndisused WW2 airfield at Westcott,\nabout 70km due north. We soon\npassed Aldermaston on our left and\nthen the M4 motorway. On a day\nlike this we could zoom at 80 knots\nbetween thermals and then pull up\nthe lift, slowing to 45 knots and\nonly bothering to circle in the\nmeatiest bits of lift. This highly\nefficient cruising technique is called\n'dolphin ing'. We covered the\nground quickly and arrived at\nWestcott at 12.23. The next leg\ntook us west 50km to another\ndisused airfield, Moreton-in-the Marsh. This leg took us over Upper\nHeyford air base whom we had to\ncall on the radio\u2014acknowledged by\nthe usual American 'Roger, have a nice day'. It was here that we met\nabout 15 gliders coming the other\nway from a national contest out of\nBristol. As they flashed by on our\nleft we exchanged greetings as is\ncustomary in the gliding world, and\ncarried on. After Moreton we\nturned NE towards Leicester, via\nthe motorway junction at Rugby.\nFlying around here one realises just\nhow many military installations\nthere are\u2014definitely not a place to\nland at except if you like prisons!\nAfter the old V bomber base at\nGaydon s lippe beneath our wings\nRugby was reached. Next was the\nshort leg to Leicester and then home\nvia Westcott again. Easy, or so we\nthought. As we headed south the\nsky looked distinctly less\npromising\u2014it was going 'blue', that\nis where the thermals do not reach\nthe condensation level so no clouds\nform. Glider pilots have to be more\nwary when his happens and look for\nground features for sources of lift.\nThen, south of Silverstone racing\ncircuit we found a stubble fire\u2014the\nglider pilot's friend. The va rio meter( rate of climb instruments) went off\nthe clock as we rapidly climbed to\n5,400 feet in the acrid, smokey\ncolumn. We still had 90km to go\nand our ground speed had slowed.\nThe chances of a win were slipping\naway. We continued south, crossing\nthe M40 at about 2000 feet and\nwere looking at fields to land in\nwhen as luck would have it we\nfound another stubble fire. We\nneeded 6000 feet to glide the 50km back to Lasham, into a sea breeze\ninduced headwind. Controlled\nairspace limited our climb to 5000\nfeet which meant we had to grovel\naround for the last few kilometres.\nThe finish is very exhilarating\u2014\nnose down and speed on to\n120knots, pull up over the trees on\nthe airfield boundary and cross the\nline at 50 feet before peeling off and\nlanding.\nOverall we placed third for the\nday and, but for the grovel at the\nend, we might have won. We had\ncovered 367km( see map) in 5 hours\n55 minutes\u2014not bad without an\nengine.\nI hope this article has given you\na taste for what gliding is about. It's cheap (this trip cost only \u00a332) and\nit's great fun. Join the gliding club,\nwe meet in Aero 266 on Thursdays\nat 1.00pm. See you there.\nAfandi Darlington.\nBIZMINGTHAH LEICEST&\nThe route followed bx the Gliding Club during the Lasham regional s Page 1 5\n\n"

If it's not bad\nenough that the British Punk\npensioners (Shaw 69, Chelsea, UK\nSubs, Vibrators, 999) are fast\nwending their way onto the same\nsocial club circuit as Gerry and the\nPacemakers and the Marmalade, we\nnow get a new album from Tom\nVerlaine and his American\ncompatriots.\nAlways THE seminal (fruitcake\ncovered with marzipan) punk band\nfrom across the big pond (you can\nkeep your Ramones, Cramps, and\nyour Blondies), Television will\nalways haunt if only for the brilliant\n'Fox Hole' and the accompanying\nfootage shown on the Old Grey\nWhistle Test back in '78. And,\nfourteen years on, they're back.\nVerlaine returns with a Lloyd Coleish lilt (or is that the other way\nround), and on 'Call Mr Lee',\ncaresses with a cactus guitar.\nIt's a sad indictment to the dearth\nof Great Songwriters that the only\ntwo decent albums to come out this\nyear are from XTC (another\nBastard Punk offspring) and\nTelevision; this is a good but not\ngreat album. And yet, '1880 or so'\ndisplays a dangerous emptiness,\nwhilst 'Shane she wrote this' just...\n... .Oh Fuck off Television. You\nput us all to shame.\nCrippledick\nBananrama\nVery. The absolutely. Those crap\nadolescent fantasy maidens are\nback, relaunched, (sic) as a Duo.\nThe pertinent question, the one\nwe're all asking, is, 'have the gals\nbroke free of Stock Aitken and\nWaterman, to pursue new heights\nof artistic integrity and challenging\nmusical forms?'. Ha. Like fuck\nthey have. Big surprise there, eh\nreaders?\nSurprise no 2 is the record,\nanother biggie here, kids. Yep,\nyou're right, it's bollocks. They've\nalso opted for what must be their\nworst career move yet, and learned\nto sing. They, no doubt, perceived\nthe deficiency left by Anne\nHathaway, or was there a Shillileagh Sister in there too?\nMaybe we'll never know... Perhaps\nit's best not to. 'Bye, Bananas, you\nwill always, have always been,\ncould never be anything but...\nsic. Ed.\nDavid\nREM: Drive\nI had really fallen out with REM.I remember the Christmas of 1987,\ntwo songs paramount in my head.\nOne was 'This Corrosion', typically\nenough; the other was 'The One I Love', a gorgeous wounded love\nsong full of bitterness. I bought\n'Eponymous' soon after. A beautiful and beguiling love affair\nensued; I discovered 'Fables of the\nReconstruction', and lost myself in\nit. 'Out of Time' was a complete\nbetrayal.\nSo, it was a harder, more bitter\nmind that demanded REM to\nengage it. 'Drive' is typical\nsimplicity, delicate and basic,\nMichael Stipe reciting in an echoing\nmonotone of forced calmness. It's their best single since 'The One I Love', as awkward, bitter and\njarring as 'Feeling Gravity's Pull',\nas simple and beautiful as 'Maps\nand Legends'. Making up is half the\nfun, isn't it? This is a truly great\nsong, and a truly great band. May\nI never wake up.\nDavid Spooner.\nBedazzled: Sugarfree\nWhat awan ky name. Yeah, right,\nBedazzled. So bewildered you\ncouldn't even play your\ninstruments. This album is an\nabsolute horse's arse of a record;\nnot even music by numbers, more\nlike join the dots. It's been\ndescribed as 'seminal'. Well, kids,\nso are the stains on your duvet.\nI really am not inclined to give this\ncrap the time of day, and if I hear\n'teenage mother superior, why\ndon't you just switch off your\ntelevision set and go out and do\nsomething less boring instead' (they\ndon't sing that. It would be funny\nif they did) I'm going to make them\neat this sugar free, which, by the\nway, translates as saccharin\noverload, fuck fest. Humbug!!\nSic. Ed.\nDavid.\nFetch, The Railway Children\nAmid the cackles and whispers of\n'arse li cker', as I believe is the\ncurrent P.C. term for a fawning\nlackey, I must say that this review\ncomes to you on behalf of one\nprepared to do 'the decent thing'.\nI think Fetch deserve a break.\nThey deserve more than they've\ngot because they're the best band on\ntonight. For your benefit, the others\nwere former indie favourites the\nRailway Children, and another\nmuch lauded band whose... whose\nname escapes me, but whose\nfondness for swirling noise\nsculptures was as conspicuously\nevident as their rip-off of the\nReviews\n5th October 1992\nHUMANITIES PROGRAMME\nLUNCH HOUR CONCERTS HT12.45 AUTUMN TERM 1992\n8th October - YORK PIANO TRIO\n1J5 th October - DUKE STRIN6 QURATET\n22nd October - COMMEMORATION DRVNO CONCERT\n24th October 80R RN TE PIANO TRIO\n5th Nouember - SI6AUN QUETES (soprano)\nand PAUL HAMBURGER (piano)\n(By arrangement with the\nAustrian Institute)\n12th Nouember - HELLIEA STRING QURRTET\n19th Nouember - I.C.

A few post-goth industrial\ntypes had turned up to have a wank\nto them. Not me.

They aren't brilliant (One might say they play\nlikeness.\n'charismatic' with competence\nrather than charisma), but they piss\nall over any one of five hundred sad\nfuck wits I could name.

    "content": "union\n5 th October1992 Felix942 Sabbaticals are students elected to\nrun and represent students for a year. They are paid to do various\njobs in the students union, out of\nmoney that you pay to the college\nin fees. Every day you are at\ncollege, a sabbatical is speaking on\nyour behalf to College man ag ment and running the students union for\nyour service.\nUnfortunately, very few people\nactually know who these mysterious\nsabbaticals are. Others believe they\nare figures that must be held in\nsome sort of awe, so cannot be\napproached. This is rubbish. ,\nSabbaticals cannot represent'you\nunless they know what you are\nthinking. So, talk to them, h arras s them, demand to know what they\nhave done for you the student.\nBelow are descriptions of\nImperial College Union sabbaticals,\nwritten by themselves about each\nother, read what they have written\nand see what you feel about those\nwho claim to represent you.\nChris Davidson President- By Jonty\nChris Davidson is a giant of a man;\nwhen he enters a room grown men\ncry, women faint and Julian Clary\nfeels ambiguous. How can the\nEnglish language contain the praise\ndue to this pillar of our community?\nWhat a sad thing it is, that he is only\nthe President of a Students Union.\nSurely greater things are calling to\nhim, or is it that he chooses to\nilluminate our lives with his\npresence?\nWhen the Students of Imperial\nCollege spoke with one voice to\nelect him president, they made a wise choice. Skilled as a diplomat,\nan orator and a business man, each\nday we spend in the Union is\nguarded over by his watchful eye.\nHow can those that do not know\nhim appreciate what my feeble\nuttering s mean. My advice is go out\nmeet him, share in his\nmagnificence, before it vanishes\nfrom all our lives when he moves\non to bigger and better things.\nCan I have my Imagesetter now\nplease?\nRick Bilby Deputy President - by Chris\nWhat can I say about Rick that has\nnot already been said, mostly by me\nbehind his back? Well despite being\na relative man mountain he has a warm and considerate inner self that\nhe reserves for special occasions, in\nfact so special that I have never seen\nit.\nA worrying recent development\nin Rick's persona is today's attempt\nat colour matching. He has\nmanaged to match his clothes, it's just that he is wearing a bright pink\nshirt and boots???. This I think is\nsomething to discourage in future.\nThis style guru of the 90's is fair\nchomping at the bit to look after you\nin the year ahead. (Just bring your\nshades.)\nDominic Wilkinson Hon Sec - by Rick\nDom's greatest aspiration is to be\na graphic designer. Doubtless you\nwill see some of his handiwork on\nUnion publicity throughout the\nyear.\nDominic can usually be found in\nthe company of a black three-piece-suite near the entrance of the Union\nOffice. The three-piece-suite is\nrarely used for its intended purpose\nas most of the time it is piled high\nwith junk. This all adds to the\nfriendly atmosphere Dom tries to\ncultivate in his office, which is\nsometimes referred to as 'The Glory\nHole'! You may find yourself in\nthere if you wish to book a room\nin the Union Building, so beware.\nYour safest bet is to sit on the floor.\nDominic is a very sensitive young\nman, so always be polite to him!\nJonty Beavan Felix Editor- By Dom\nA Jonty Poem\nHe said I had to write something\nexplaining what he's like.\nHis girlfriend is called Emma\nand he doesn't have a bike.\nHis hair is long and tousled,\nhis eyes are deep and set.\nHe spends his time in Felix,\nhave you guessed who it is yet?\nHe has a nose for stories,\nis keen to know your views.\nHe'll stick them in his paper,\nthat is bumper packed with\nnews.\nSo in four lines of conclusion\nabout someone I don't know.\nI'm sure he's rather lovely,\nor he may just be a complete\nbastard.\n\n"

    "content": "opinion\neditor i a If you are reading this magazine as\na new student at Imperial College,\nI pity you. I have been here for\nthree years, and in that time, had\nthe trust that even though College\nand Government were messing with\nstudents, at least someone was\nstanding up for the your point of\nview. You have lost that guarantee.\nAs reported exclusively on the\nnews pages of Felix, the Minister\nfor Education will make an\nannouncement on Wednesday about\nhow student unions will be funded.\nIt is expected that the 'Voluntary\nPrinciple' will form the major part\nof this statement. The 'Voluntary\nPrinciple' is the right to choose\nwhether you join a students union,\nwhen you go to university. Sounds\ninnocuous enough, but if the\nstatement was re-worded 'Do you\nwant \u00a3 8 0 more grant or to join the\nstudents union?' Which would you\ngo for?\nHow are you, who have just\narrived at university and in most\ncases never been near a students\nunion, meant to make a sensible\nchoice on this? You have never\nneeded to see a welfare advisor,\nbeen to the bar, had a problem with\nFelix 942\nyour department or joined one of\nthe clubs and societies. Just think\nhow far your 'extra' \u00a380 would\nstretch if you tried using equivalent\nfacilities outside of your union. A trip to a local pub should prove the\npoint.\nI cannot say that students unions\nare perfect, they are not, but at least\nif you are given a. choice you have\nduty to make an informed decision.\nMake sure you get involved in some\nlevel of the students union. Then\nmake the choice whether it is worth\nthe money that college has invested\non your behalf.\n5th October 1992\nThe external genitalia and vagina with diagrams of the anal sphincter, by Leonardo da Vinci. Would\nyou name a bar after this man ?\nThanks for all the stuffing\nDear Jonty,\nCan we please say a big thank you\nto everyone who helped us with the\ncollation of this year's handbook,\nand with the stuffing of all the\nenvelopes for the mailing to this\nyear's fresher s.

    "content": "'eat ure5 th October 1992 Felix 942\nCareers-Why worry now?\nDear Fresher.\nWelcome to Imperial College.\nThe next three or four years should\nbe among the most interesting and\nenjoyable in your life, provided you\nmake the most of the opportunities\navailable at College. This letter\naims to give you some ideas for\nyour own self-development.\nYou can probably recall one of\nthe significant steps in your life\nwhen you entered the sixth form or\nwent to sixth form college. Coming\nto College is an even more\nsignificant step. You have freedom,\nmore independence and more\nopportunities to do your own thing\nand to succeed or fail. If you do not\nmake some mistakes you will not\nhave learnt anything, learning from\none's own mistakes is an important\npart of experience, but don't waste\ntime reinventing everything\u2014build\non the experience of others\u2014take\nadvice (it's usually free)\u2014ignore\nsome of it, test it out accept it or\nreject it.\nYou have already demonstrated\nsome planning ability by passing\n'A' Levels\u2014or their equivalent\u2014\nsufficiently well to be at College.\nHow are you going to plan the next\nthree, four or six years? And I'm not talking just about your academic\nstudies, I'm talking about the start\nof the rest of your life.\nWhat do you want to achieve this\nterm? Making friends is usually\nhigh on most people's list. How?\nJoin clubs and societies, attend\nmeetings, take up a new sport,\ndevelop a new interest\u2014any of\nthese are likely to bring you into\ncontact with like-minded students.\nAnd there's always the bar to prop\nup while seeking inspiration.\nBy the end of the summer term\nin your first year you are feeling the\nfinancial pressure\u2014in other words\nyou're broke! So how about earning\nsome good money in the long\nvacation. If you leave job hunting\nuntil the vac starts you may be too\nlate. All the interesting and lucrative\njobs have been filled already and\nyou will be lucky if the local council\nwants some grass cutting or the\ngarden centre needs a dirty pair of\nhands. It's well worthwhile doing\nsome preliminary job hunting\nbetween Christmas and Easter. Call\nin at the IC Careers Service (Room\n310, Sherfield Building) where you\nwill find information about\nVacation Training, write to\nemployers with your CV, call in to\nsome local shops and hotels and see\nwho's advertising in the local press.\nVac jobs can be most\ninformative. Ideally they give you\nthe chance to try out some type of\nwork or future employer in which\nyou are interested. They give you\nexperience in job hunting, letter\nwriting and interviews, as well as\na real insight into what it's like to\nwork for a particular type of\nemployer. Some even pay you quite\nwell. Jobs abroad are popular and\nearly applications are essential.\nStart by visiting the IC Careers\nService which has a good range of\nreference books and addresses.\nAt the start of the second year you\nraise your sights higher. Now is the\ntime to test your skills in organising\nsomething\u2014a social evening for\nyour department, looking after the\nfinances of a society or fixtures\nsecretary of your team. That sounds\ntoo much like hard work I hear you\nsay. Yes, it does take some effort\non your part but generally speaking\nthe more effort you put into\nsomething the more enjoyment you\nwill get out of it.\nCommittee work is excellent\npreparation for life after College.\nYou learn to set agendas, run\nmeetings, agree actions, persuade\nother students to do things, work\nwithin budgets and end up with a successful event\u2014a party, a visit,\na play or a newspaper. (Think how\nmuch effort went into producing\nthis edition of 'Felix')\nYou should start thinking\nseriously about your future career\nbefore the end of the second year.\nEven if you haven'ta clue what you\nwant to do, that's no excuse for\ndelaying finding out about the\npossibilities. You are surrounded\nwith sources of information-friends, family, tutors, careers\nadvisers, libraries. Start looking. It\nmay be a long process but so is life,\nso it really is worth spending more\ntime thinking about your career than\nplanning your next weekend or\nholiday.\nThe IC Careers Service is a good\nstarting point. Pop in and speak to\nthe information staff. Find out about\n'GRADSCOPE' and 'PROSPECT'\nand all the information booklets and\nreference files. Have a look at some\nof the videos, attend some seminars\non careers, get yourself sorted out.\nThe Milkround visits by\nemployers are in the spring term of\nyour final year.\nChristmas vacation courses are a popular way of finding out about\ncareers such as marketing but only\na few major recruiters run them and\nthey are normally over-subscribed\nmany times.\nStop! I'm only a fresher\u2014why\nare you telling me ail this?\nI'm telling you because you need\nto start planning your degree now,\ndon't just drift through College and\nemerge with a degree and nothing\nelse. Of course a degree is\nimportant and must be your first\npriority, but not your only priority.\nIn the meantime, enjoy yourself.\nJohn Simpson, Director, IC\nCareers Service.\nJm\nCareers Information\nFinal year undergraduates and\npostgraduates should have received\na personal copy of the Graduate\nRecruitment Programme which\nincludes the Programme of\nEvents/Careers Talks.\nCareers Talks There are two\nCareers Talks this week in LT213\nHuxley at 1.00 to 1.50pm. No\nbooking is necessary, just turn up.\nTuesday 6th October. 'Introducing\nthe Careers Service' by John\nSimpson, Director, IC Careers\nService. Thursday 8th October.\n'Graduate Study in the USA' by Dr\nDavid Stuckey, a former US\nScholar and now in Chemical\nEngineering.\nWarning\u2014There are unlikely to\nbe more vacancies in 1993, and\ncompetition will be as severe as it\nhas been in 1992.\nAdvice\u2014Apply early and use the\nMilkround. For further information\ncome to the Careers Service, Room\n310 Sherfield\u2014open from 10am to\n5pm Monday to Friday.

Top comedy,\nfairground attractions, cocktails,\ncasinos and lots and lots of fun?\nWell, read on .... We've got three\nlarge events on the Monday,\nWednesday and Friday of Fresher's Week (5th9 th October).\nHeadlining in the Concert Hall on\nMonday night will be Sunscreem.\nHot on the heels of their recent chart\nsmash 'Love U More' (as seen on\nTOTP), and with their new single\n'Perfect Motion' set to be an even\nbigger smash, they'll be playing a live set crammed full of frantic\ndance music. Described as 'the\nultimate indie-dance crossover,\nthey'll be supported by hot new\ndance act Hysterix, with Dave\nValentine and Vicky Red playing\nthe latest club tunes into the early\nhours at Club Atmosphere.\nDownstairs on Monday will be\nPerspex Whiteout, often compared\nto Alex Chiltern and Teenage\nFanclub and in fact often\nname checked by Norman Blake\nhimself. They are one of our hottest\nup and coming bands on the indie\ncircuit. Don't miss them.\nAlso on Monday we'll have a late\nbar, disco 'till 3am, cocktails and\nfairground attractions.\nOn Wednesday you'll have a chance to laugh off the hangover\nblues with three top comedians\nfrom the London comedy circuit -Ian Cognito, Mark Maier and\nWilty. Ticket holders for this event\nmust arrive no later than 8.15pm otherwise we cannot guarantee your\nentrance. There will be a late bar\nand disco 'till lam after the\ncomedy.\nIn the Concert Hall on Friday\nnight will be the Nutty Boys. This\nband consists of two former\nmembers of Madness, fresh from\ntheir two sell-out dates at Finsbury\nPark this summer, and with their\nown unique blend of Ska, this\nyear's party band are bound to set\nthe house on fire. They'll be\nsupported by the Time Wasters, a fresh London soul band who'll be\nsprinkling their set with choice\nBlues Brothers Numbers.\nIn the Lounge on Friday night are\nThe Rockingbirds.

Well.\nBalloon Club for starters...! But is\nit worth it? I certainly think so.\nMany people find that ballooning is\nthe most spectacular experience\nthey've ever had. It's a uniquely\npeaceful and exciting way to fly.\nA brightly coloured balloon\nfloating by always attracts car loads of spectators and the envious waves\nof early-morning dog walkers.\nInside the basket, you can watch\nthem all, wave back and enjoy the\nfeeling of the slight breeze on your\nface. Ballooning makes other forms\nof flying seem sterile.\nThe early morning starts are a necessary evil if you want to catch\nthe calmest flying conditions. Most\nof the year it's possible to fly twice\na day. once in the early morning\nand once in the early evening. It\ntakes half an hour to rig up the\nballoon ready for flight. When the\npilot (and sometimes a trainee r pilot) have completed their list of\nsafety checks, the lifeless shape of\nthe envelope is filled with cold air.\nThen the burner roars and the\nenvelope begins to lift off the grass.\nA few minutes later you're\nairborne.\nTakeoff in a balloon is very\ngentle, unlike the noise and ear-popping of takeoff in an aeroplane.\nStanding in the basket, there's only\na sort of surreal awareness that the\nground is slowly dropping away\nfrom you. The ground crew,\nmeanwhile, get back into the\nminibus to follow the balloon's course along the roads, which takes\nsome skilled navigating.\nI won't kid you that you just pay\nyour membership fee and then\nthat's all the effort the club will ask\nyou to put in return for flights.\nBalloon club manages to fly\neveryone so cheaply because\neveryone is asked to play their part\nin getting the balloon air bourne. You may well find yourself acting\nas ground crew and not flying. But\nyou won't be forgotten. The real\nbonus about flying with Imperial\nCollege Balloon Club is the chance\nto train as a pilot.

A friend\nand I make it at least one a day.\nBalloon Club could be your best\nchance to experience the thrill of\nballooning for yourself.\nIf you're interested, contact Mark\nAtthey, Physics 2.\nWatersports\nThe Swimming and Waterpolo Club\nis one of the largest and most\nsuccessful y clubs at College. We\ntrain twice a week, Mondays and\nFridays from 6.30-7.30pm. Train\nis probably the wrong word as we\ncater for all tastes, from those who\njust fancy a paddle to those with\nmore masochistic tendencies.\nWaterpolo training takes place\nstraight after and we encourage\nanyone, even vaguely interested to\nstay and give this exciting, fast\nmoving game a try. We have a strong team, taking part in both\nuniversity competitions and the\nlocal Middlesex league. New\nplayers, beginners or seasoned\nveterans are always needed and\nmost welcome. There is also an\nactive ladies team.\nSocially each evening is rounded\noff with a trip to the college bar,\neach term with a club dinner and\neach, year with a water polo tour.

Currently, all\nmembers of a college or university\nare automatically members of the a student union.\nJan Moore, a press officer for the\nDepartment for Education, said that\nthe Conservative Party conference\nwas completely separate from\ndepartmental business, and that she\ncouldn't possibly comment. This is\na similar argument used to deny the\nexistence of a students' charter in\nJanuary. Since then, a succession of\nstudents' charters have been\npublished by higher education\ninstitutions.\nSenior figures in Conservative\nStudents have privately hailed the\nreports as a 'significant victory',\nand will be participating in the\nConference education debate on\nWednesday.\nThe reports follow a frantic\nsummer for the student union\nmovement. In June, a back bench Conservative MP, Graham\nRiddick, initiated a Commons\ndebate on voluntary membership on\nstudent unions. Mr Riddick said that\nit was 'indefensible' for students not\nto have choice in joining student\nunions. Mr Nigel Forman the\nminister for Higher Education also\nintimated that he would welcome\nconsultations on the matter of\nvoluntary membership, though no\nofficial announcement of\nconsultations was made. These talks\nwere expected to merge with\nongoing consultations, initiated by\nKenneth Clarke on the subject\nduring his tenure as Secretary of\nState for Education. / CNN understands the minister stoped\nreceiving consultations a week ago\nFollowing the Commons debate,\nthe Adam Smith Institute, a right\nwing policy group, published a student charter. The National Union\nof Students(NUS) claimed that the\nAdam Smith document conceded\nthe 'right of student representation'.\nThe NUS is believed to be\nconsidering a policy review. In\nparticular, Lorna Fitzsimons, the\nNUS President, has publicly\nsupported a graduate tax, whereby\nuniversity graduates pay additional\ntaxes to cover the costs of their\neducation. Ms Fitzsimons has also\nhad discussion with an offshoot of\nthe Saatchi and Saatchi\norganisation, cent ring on the public\nperception of the NUS.\nThe principle of voluntary\nmembership was discussed by\nseveral college unions throughout\nthe summer. Sheffield University\nStudents' Union published a draft\ndiss cus sion document for the\nHigher Education Minister which\naccepted the principle of voluntary\nmembership.\nThe Sheffield document was\nattacked by other student unions,\nConservative Students, and the\nNUS. The University of London\nUnion (ULU) is still trying to\nformulate a response. Mark\nSamuels, UL U President, called an\ninformal meeting of sabbaticals and\nothers on 21 September to discuss\nthe document. Non-binding draft\nsubmissions from London colleges\nare expected later in the term.\nImperial College Union is currently\nworking on a set of Documents to\nbe diss cussed in the future. It is\nbelieved that a final document may\nbe submitted to the Higher\nEducation Minister.\nImperial College Union\nExecutive Committee is currently\nworking on a set of documents to\nbe discussed in the future.

    "content": "opinion\n5th October 1992 Felix 942\nA Waste of Talent\nAnd the game this week is 'You are\nthe lead singer of Fetch and I claim\nmy ten pounds'. Very funny.\nWhich of you self-congratulatory\nbastards is it then? Let us look at\nthe facts here; some tw at wrote that\nshitty lard thing a few weeks back.\nThe same week I sent in my piece\non the origins of the surname\n'Humphries'. Which got published?\nExhibit A. Next, it was that Oh, so terribly\nfunny and not a bit in-jokey at all\n'Who's run off with my\nWednesday'. Clever use of Tom\nBaker, too; never heard that one\nbefore, honest. Is it mere\ncoincidence that at the same time I send in a piece concerning Douglas\nAdams' ideas on the Blinovitch\nLimitation Effect? Exhibit B. Exhibit C is your front page story\nconcerning Stanhope. You\ndeliberately stuck in some untruths\njust to fill out space, and you had\nthe added bonus of printing an\napology in the next issue. Guess\nwhat? more space filled. I bet that\nfucker who always wears Sisters of\nMercy T Shirts has something to do\nwith this. But it's not just him, is\nit? You're all in on this. As far as\nyou and your sickeningly\nsycophantic world is concerned,\nI'm an outlaw. I'm controversial;\nI represent a radical challenge to\nyour recidivist nonsense, and you\ndon't like it. You're all so hack y and chummy, you media types, lots\nof 'Dahling Clarissa! How's dear\nlittle Tigger and Smudge?'. It's like\nPhil Collins selling millions of\nrecords on his reputation as 'an\nordinary blok e', or rubbing tan shoe\npolish into your hair. It doesn't quite gel. You wouldn't publish my\nhilarious and rip-roaring ly funny\n137-part 'Adventures in\nUnderpants', would you? You gave\nA typical martian reaction to it.\nme 'Yeah, yeah. Next decade'\nevery time I came into the office;\nalways fobbing me off, always\nplacating me. Well, it never\nhappened, did it?\nNow, I have been accused of\ndealing with the public in a manner\nto which they are not accustomed.\nIt is true, there have been\nmisunderstandings. A notable being\nmy submission to the 'Confessions'\nseries of novellas, relating the tale\nof the cloakroom attendant. It was\nrejected, as the mystery of the\nmissing 17p and the half-pack of\nmints was deemed too flimsy, but\nI wanted to show how big a thing\nguilt can be. You just don't understand, do you? Your credits\nwill read, Thanks to Blurb for his\nprolific talent, thanks to Hack for\nbeing a terrific sounding board,\nthanks to cough for coming into the\noffice and doing fuck all, but he's Brian Cant before his extermination.\na mate and agrees with me lots,\nthanks to splutter for his\nextraordinary bottom, and thanks to\nahem for his comforting bad breath.\nWhat about the poor jobbing writer?\nWell, I 'll tell you. My new book's called 'Mickie Most: a life in pop'\nand is a touching tale of his life,\nlove and hardship at the forefront\nof the pop industry. He discusses\nfrankly the rivalry between Tony\nHatch and Derek Hobson as his\nreason for leaving the cast of 'New\nFaces', and the commercial disaster\nof his updated hip-hop version of\nthe Goodies 'Funky Gibbon'. It'll\nshow those bastards at 'Woman's Realm' who refused to publish the\nserialized version of 'the Derek\nHobson Story', detailing his\nfriendship with Peters & Lee, and\nthe making of 'That's My Dog'. In\nthe pipeline, also, 'The Further\nAdventures of Wayne, Topov, and\nHartley Hare' of T.V.'s 'Pipkin'\nfame. There are still copies\navailable of my biography of Giant\nHaystacks, entitled 'It's only a Job',\nand deals mainly with his marriage\nto Sheila, his 'Bad Guy' image and\nhis weight problem.\nI don't care if you don't publish\nthis; I'm a superstar who's both\nmarvellous and less fat too.\nNo, you don't, you bastards! I didn't write that. Play by the rules,\nyeah? How can I be a self-publicist\nif I don't generate my own\npublicity? Eeh, you'll be the death\nof me, all you Maeve Binchy/Irwin\nShaw acolytes, and the death of\nquality literature, too. John Osborne\nwas right about writers; they're all\nrotten sports. I was talking to a writer the other day, a chap that did\nads for Crest toothpaste, and I told\nhim that he was a filthy pig\ncapital ising on the need for dental\nhygiene. Alan Ayckbourn was\nright, too, and his teeth were well\ndecayed, rotting in his mouth they\nwere. Christopher 'Superman'\nReeve and Steve 'Crystal Palace'\nCoppell had similar problems too.\nLewis 'Bodie' Collins would've\ndone both jobs better, had he not got\ninvolved with the Gay Serum Affair\nand turned queer overnight. That's another thing: who authorised that\ncentre page spread filled entirely\nwith Oscar Wilde's maxims? That\nwas certainly a little girly, and\nwouldn't have happened if Peter\nDuncan, Janet Ellis and Simon\nGroom had been there to add that\nlittle Blue Petery touch. Only they\ncould tell such stories as Art\nGarfunkel's secret desire to be a medium pace bowler for Pakistan,\nor Glenda Jackson's longing to be\na pizza chef in a busy Italian\ntake away? Completely untrue,\nprobably, but only Janet Ellis and\nSimon Groom can lend the most\nwicked fibs a degree of sincerity\nand a sense of conviction.\nThis is the kind of stuff that gets\nignored in the media, but these\npeople don't become stars for\nnothing. Congratulations, by the\nway, on hitting the national\nconsciousness again, this time in the\nTimes Higher Education\nSupplement.
