    "content": "Page Two FELIX22 nd October, 1970\nWellsoc success\nSpeaking to a packed\nGreat Hall on Monday, 12th October, Sir Barnes Wallis,\nCBE, FRS, opened the 7th season of Wellsoc meetings\nwith his Presidential Ad dress. 'Transport\u2014Past, Present and Future\". After a passing (historical reference to\nBritain's sea trade, Sir Barnes went on to consider air-travel in the shape of bal-loons(!), particularly his own\n'brainchild', the R100. Whilst\ndesigning this balloon he\nreached the momentous conclusion that it was better to\nknow nothing about everything than everything about\nnothing! This massive craft\n\u2014once described by a visiting Admiral as a 'blasted\nwaste of space'\u2014required\nsuch precision in construction and so large a hangar\nto house it that Sir Barnes\nconfidently ruled out any\nmodern revival of the rigid\nballoon.\nSWING WING Sir Barnes then continued\nto describe his design for a hypersonic variable-geometry\n(swing-wing to the uni nia ted) jet, having first amply demonstrated on a map that\nEngland really was the centre of the world air- and sea-routes. This aircraft, he\nclaimed, could travel at\nMach 5, at a height of some\n150,000 feet, and fly 10,000\nmiles nonstop, using only\nconventional alloys for the\nfuselage. Higher speed might\nneed some cooling, he added,\nif only to preserve the rubber tyres, or the passengers.\nHe developed a fully working\nmodel despite insufficient\nradio wavelengths to control\nit, but regrettably finance\nwas withdrawn. Undismayed,\nSir Barnes hawked his idea\naround until the U.S. decided to 'buy' it. The result was\nthe American designed and,\n\u2014 Sir Barnes Wallis\nby now, (in)famous Fill, the\nfailure of which still gives\nSir Barnes considerable\namusement.\nmoo Despite the financial set-back, Sir Barnes has turned\nhis attention to the theory of\nslender bodied flight. His\nlatest design is little more\nthan a flying wedge\u2014no\nlonger the conventional\nfuselage, no external engines,\nand no wings as such! The\nrectangular cross-section\nmakes use of his vast knowledge and experience of light\nrigid structures, gained from\nthe R100; this specialised information being, he said, the\nmajor factor influencing the\ndesign, or rather its absence\nuntil now.\nGAS TO ICE\nAlthough advanced in\nyears (Sir Barnes was 83 in\nSeptember), he has far from\nexhausted his fund of new\nideas as this design shows\nTurning his attention to the\nsea, he suggested that a submarine merchant navy might\nbe a wise investment, particularly as the polar routes\nare navigable, without the undue expense of nuclear\npower. With a touch of\nWellsian invention, he proposed that the exhaust gases\ndf a turbine engine be recycled to boost power output.\nAnd the excess caf bon di-oxide? Compress and store\nit, and at the end of a round\ntrip of the world, sell it as\ndry-ice to the Walls ice cream\ncompany!\nAnd on that whimsical\nnote, Sir Barnes Wallis ended\nhis brilliant lecture, which\nwill be remembered as one\nof the most fascinating and\nbest attended in the history\nof the Society.\nROSS HOWIE\nSTOIC STARS\nOn Wednesday, 14th October, the Student Television of\nImperial College, S.T.O.I.C., showed some of the documentary, feature and news programmes they have made over the\npast year. Sinclair Goodlad, introducing the organisation,\ntold us that their main problem is money, but bravely forecast that S. T.O. LC. would be screening regular programmes\nin the College Block early in 1971, via a video link from\nElec. Eng. There has been some disagreement about the cost\nof providing such a link, and who should pay. The pro-Rector\nwas attending the meeting.\nIt is indeed surprising that with such restricted funds\nthey have done so well. Their film of the Queen's opening of\nthe College Block last November was excellently compiled\nand photographed, and should be more widely seen throughout the College. Also shown was part of a news programme\nwith interviews of Union presidential candidates, and a view of the car of a Yugoslavian dignitary departing after\na visit to the College. Apparently they knew nothing of his\nvisit before assembling outside to record the introduction\nof the programme. And their longest programme to date is\nabout pirate radio stations, and largely comprises an interview with Mike Raven, of which we saw part.\nSir Barnes lectures\nCarnival kicks off\nCarnival\u2014pronounced CAR Nl VAL, is an elegant\nand inadequate word used to describe this college's efforts\nto make money for charity. For fresher s' benefit with your\nas yet limited vocabulary, it's just a post name for 'rag';\nbeware of cheap imitations such as Guilds or RCS Carnivals\nwhich are all night raves run on st riot non-profit or total\nloss basis.\nWell, 'things' happen throughout the year intentionally\nor otherwise, but the bulk of the street collecting, fuzz\nbaiting, blackmailing, etc., is hopefully done in the first term.\nFor example, a sponsored walk, raffle, fet e,t idd ley winks\nrace (Oxford Street), and removal of the Albert Hall are\nall traditional events guaranteed to bring a smile to the\nhardiest riot squad.\nThe planning and co-ordination is entrusted to a Carnival\nCommittee complete with its very own Chairman/Carnival\nCo-or d in at or, who this year is the ever present Dennis Taylor.\nWith commendable diplomacy he has already engaged(!)\nthe services of Maria Assumpta and French Institute Colleges in Carnival and hopes such a joint venture will be to\neveryone's mutual advantage, even including the WCSS\u2014\nwhich brings us to . . . this year's charity (democratically\nelected at the last UGM!)\u2014the Westminster Council of\nSocial Service. This is a so-called 'umbrella charity' embracing the many problems encountered in today's central\nurban areas. The above council concerns itself with the Paddington area which contains much bad and overcrowded\nhousing, and one of the consequences of this is the lack\nof amenities for children, especially in North Paddington.\nMoney is desperately needed to run an already heavily used\nsummer playground at Christmas and Easter, to perhaps\nobtain a site for a proposed Youth Club, and to provide\nat least one all purpose advice centre which could offer legal\nand housing advice, welfare rights, rent rebates and help in\nnumerous other hassles. That's what it's all about and a good effort this year should hopefully realise enough money\nfor I.C. to be associated with a specific project under the\ndirection of the Council.\nThe first committee meeting is on Tuesday, 20th October,\nat 1.0 p.m. in Committee Room A( Union Lounge). Anyone\nwith ideas/gorillas/vans/tanks/blank cheques etc. is especially\nwelcome, or invited to get in touch (careful) with Dennis\nTaylor, via Union rack in ICU offices, Guilds Union Office\nor Linstead 416.\n1\nQueen of Jez\nStudents:\nA BarclaysCheque\nAccount is\nfree to you.

    "content": "Page Six FELIX22 nd October, 1979\nIn the last year, those of you who were around, will\nprobably have come across the work of the Student Television of Imperial College in the shape of the Newsreel or\nMike Raven talking about his experiences in Pirate Radio.\nSTOIC's object is to give its members experience in operating TV equipment and to make TV programmes to show\nto the members of the Union. We operate from the TV studio in Elec Eng (who have been a great help to us) and\nso far have shown our programmes by man-handling the\nVideo Tape Recorder down to the ICR.\nOur activities at present are being hindered by several\nunavoidable difficulties:\nFirstly, the department is rebuilding the studio (and, we\nhope, improving it) and it will be out of action for the rest\nof this term at least.\nOur output, when it gets going again, cannot now be\nshown in the old way as the V TR will not travel well and\nwe don't want to damage it. The answer is to install a line\nbetween Room 306 in Elec Eng and the I CR, a distance of\nless than 50 yards. The cost of the line and installation was\nworked out to be around \u00a350. However, when the money\nwas asked for RC C rightly passed it on to Student Finance.\nEventually it worked its way back to us and College maintenance had estimated \u00a3600 for the cost! Their idea of installation was to permanently pass the cable through ducting via the basements of Elec Eng and College Block. With\nthe extra equipment this would entail the extra cost was\nenormous. Since our line would only be used for Union\npurposes (unless the College wished to rent time on the\ncircuit) the lines to the SCR and other rooms incorporated\nin the maintenance plan, would not be necessary.\nNormal finance is another problem. TV is an incredibly\nexpensive medium, with the Department wanting \u00a32/10/0 an\nhour for use of the Studio. The production of even the smallest programme then becomes costly and RC C can hardly\nbe expected to spend all their time discussing our finance.\nIt would rather be like Felix having to account for every\narticle separately to an overworked committee.\nWith the link coming in to bring programmes from the\nInner London Education Authority and the facilities offered\nby the National Association of Student Television it should\nbe possible for STOIC eventually to show programmes of a highly diverse nature on several days a week as well as providing an outlet for the cine photographers in the college\nwho fancy covering news.\nA note about membership. We have sadly to charge you\n10 shillings for the privilege of slogging your guts out to\nmake programmes (it is very hard work) but if you still\nfancy helping us and the College then get in touch with\nRICHARD PARK IN S Maths III who will send you a form\nasking you your particular interests which may range from\nNewsreading to Producing. Or if you are around EE306 then\ndrop in and ask our friendly neighbourhood Technician\nColin for a form.\nWhat is it?\nChristian The answers concepts are all yes \u2014\nIs your college christian union:\n* the most active social club ?\n* the cheapest club to attend ?\n* the only social club to play\ninter-collegiate netball ?\n* the only club to organise an\nannual house party for USK ?\n* linked with similar groups in almost\nall London Uninversity colleges ?\n* part of a national & worldwide\nmovement of similar groups ?\n* holding most open meeting with\noutside speakers this term ?\n* separatist ?\nfor you ?\nYes, there are at least six meetings for members a week.\nYes, no charge for attendance is ever made.\nYes. it even beats Kings !\nYes, every November.\nYes, it is a member branch of the U.L. U. christian union, known as L.I. F.C.U. Yes, it is part of I.V.F.( Britain) and thus\nof I.F. E.S.( The World).\nYes, there are at least thirteen, designed for\nthe college as a whole, e.g. One Way.\nYes, its members are not prepared to compromise their beliefs, on pressure from\nothers.\nYes, though you probably don't realise it,\nthe only way to prove it is to come along.\nFELIX\nstill\nneeds\nstaff\nIf you are interested in helping\nto produce a better\nnewspaper for your\nunion, join us \u2014\npress meetings:\nTues. and Thurs.\nIu nch time1.00 p.m.** any queries as to the validity of the statements should be addressed to A.N. Syrop\n(M.E.2), publicity secretary One Way.\nRacer reviewed\nI suppose that the case of\nDOWNHILL RACER is\nnot far removed from that\nof CHARLIE BUBBLES. When Albert Finney made\nCHARLIE BUBBLES about\nthree years ago, one would\nhave thought the commercial\nrelease would be quite\nassured. Directed by a well\nknown actor, also taking the\nmain role, with Billie Whitelaw, Colin Blakely and Liza\nMinelli, and screenplay by\nShelagh Delany, it would\nhave been expected to do\nwell. Indeed, when first released in America only, it\nwas well received by the\ncritics and the cinema-gein g public. However the big\nBritish Circuits wouldn't bite, so that when it opened\nat the Chelsea Essoldo, after\na big critical build-up, not\nsurprisingly it broke the boxoffice records.\nDOWNHILL RACER, now on an indefinite run at\nthe Chelsea Essoldo, is apparently doing even better,\nafter they cornered its London premier following\n\"selected release\" in the provinces and a similar critical\nreaction.\nRobert Redford's role is a complete change from the\nself-assured Sundance. In\nDOWNHILL RACER he\nplays David Chappallet, a skier in the United States'\nteam competing in Europe.\nAs a downhill racer his\nsingle-mindedness and selfish\ndrive bring him into conflict\nwith the team's coach. But\nhis first international season\nis a success until he falls in\nthe last race. Back home in\nColorado he is aimless, at a loss trying to communicate\nwith his father. Back in\nEurope for the Winter\nOlympics a rash contest between him and a team-mate\nleads to an accident and\nDavid's becoming the team's main hope. He of course\nwins the Gold Medal after a spectacular performance.\nThe film nicely captures\nthe transient atmosphere,\nand the hard ambition in the\nevent without the too common novel et tish injections of\n\"human ising\" drama \u2014 the\nsportsmen here are far removed from the Bond image.\nWith Ichikawa's Tokyo\nOlympics film, this must\nrank as one of the best films\nabout sport. The photography of the race scenes is\nsuperb \u2014 very exciting and\nlooking absolutely authentic.\nIts success is that its enjoyment doesn't depend on being as portman, let alone a skier, oneself.

We are back\u2014but look\naround, is it the same?\nHasn't it changed at all? The\nonce seeming immutable\nhier achy of instruction and\nnon participation crumbled\nslightly last year under pre s sure.\nThe profs who had said\n'We are masters and you are\ndisciples' didn't get their way,\nthe authorities who said 'Run\noff' to the Architectural Association looked obviously\nwrong. The supposedly very\nconservative IC students\nactually boycotted and de-mon st rated!! These, and\nother, things were of course\nnot fundamental changes in\nIC's structure, but they represent important changes in\nattitude\u2014the once solid concrete and steel buildings now\nlook more like cardboard\nand wood: maybe now we\ncan grasp 'where it's all at\"\n. . . It's mostly in your daily\nlife\u2014in your department\u2014\nwhere the screws turn\ntightest.\nIt's up to you and your\ndept. and year reps to change\nit there. Your reps\u2014democratically elected by a democratically agreed process\nneed back-up. Some de pts. still refuse to even allow the\ndept. reps to attend staff/\nstudent committees. How\nridiculous! Who are these\nfudd y dud dy empire builders who believe that their self\nappointed elitist hierarchies\nhave divine rights to ignore\nus? What happens in your\ndept? Will the hier achi es above us ever be made democratic\u2014all support for the\njunior staff who are working\nfor democracy!\nThere is growing disse n tion among staff and students\nabout the cliquish way in\nwhich dept. heads are chosen.\nThe 4 year rotating head-ship in maths was a step for-ward. The present power\nstruggle in Physics (follow-ing the leaving of Prof. Butler former Head of dept.) is\nactivating the junior staff\nthere. But will they get a real\nsay? When will students get\na say? And what about the\ntechnical and secretarial\nstaff? The Head of dept.\nafter all, affects them all.\nWhen will the financial\naffairs of de pts. become democratic and public?\nElementary principles of\ndepartmental organization\nare laid out in the moderate\nand widely supported Union\ndocument on the subject\n(from Union Office) \u2014 now\nbeing discussed in de pts. When will it be fully implemented in your dept? Hurry\nit up!\nCourses\nOn more about 'where it's at', what about courses? We\ncannot go on cramming\nmore and more irrelevant detail into our heads. Throw\nout detail and bring in\ncourses and projects of social\nand political relevance which\nwill help us understand why\nwe are here and the dangers\nof what we might do.\nThe building of democracy\nin de pts. will help change\ncourses\u2014but we must also\nhave our own specific ideas,\nso let the students in each\ndept. work with the Union\nto make alternatives.\nKeep smiling with springtime hope.\nPiers Corbyn.\nNOON TODAY\nTHE RESPONSIBILITY OF\nTHE SCIENTIST\nThis is the theme for the Com mem Day Service at\nNOON TODAY. The service, which is non - denominational, is\nstudent planned to highlight an ethical approach\nto this vital question.\nThe preacher is MERVYN STOCK WOOD, controversial Bishop of Southwark.\nThe time : 12 noon, Thursday, 22nd October.\nHoly Trinity Church, Prince Consort Road, next\nto the Union.\nDo my sleep filled eyes\ndeceive me or do I see a bunch of new shining white\nhopes for British Technology? Excuse me for not\ninstantly recognizing you, but\n9.30 is a trifle early for\nerudite observations. Permit\nme to welcome you to our\nhallowed halls, and of course\ndue to the longer hours we\nshall see more of you glowing examples of the high\narts of tailoring and barber-ing! Those of you who have\nbeen informed that your\nsojourn' here is to provide\na base for antisocial political\nagitation, had better hire\nwigs for the early 'demos'\nof the term or you may find\nyourselves accused of being\n'fuzz'es narks'.\nThe new improved opening time and lengthened\nhours is to allow the magic\nof diversification to enter our\ndrab humdrum technological\nexistences and humanize our\ninnermost selves, well that's what the bump h says! Whatever the reason, the working\nweek is now five hours longer.\nI am assured however that\nthis will not mean more\n'technical' lectures being\nsqueezed in, because our illustrious past President has\npersonally told the Board of\nStudies not to put in any\nextra lectures. This will come\nas a relief to many of us,\nas we know how much attention the B.o.S. pays to Piers!\nAny old lags who have to\nrise early in order to make\na9.30 start and have trouble\nremembering the new starting time should phone Piers\nwhen they get up (say about\n6.00 a.m.) and check.\nFor those gourmets who\ndine in the College Block\nButtery will have noted the\nbeginning of term re styling, involving the removal of\nmany of the tables and\nchairs from the Junior Common Room, so the already\ntray less diners at the Pie\nand Chippie have to crush\neven tighter on the inadequate table space or presumably sit on the floor,\nalthough -they will no longer\nhave any tablecloths as there\nseems to be a drastic reduction in the number of newspapers available. The shortage of table space is made\nless acute by keeping the\nqueue moving very slowly,\nthis is accomplished by only\nhaving one till operational.\nThese improvements must of\ncourse be paid for and the\nprices have in fact been in-creased. 'Is this to cover a pay rise for the staff?' you\nmay ask, well as yet the\nserving staff have had no\nrise and it is not exactly surprising that they are hard to\ncome by! Some may ask why\nthe increase? This is presumably a price of food in-crease, so stand by for a 'staff rise' increase in the\nprice of your Pie. (And a new decimal price increase\nwith the introduction of\nmetric chips?).\nMARY LEWIS : one of the rare sights seen behind Stan's bar in S/ S this term.

    "content": "Page Four FELIX22 nd October, 1970\nLocal pubs reviewed\nThe story so far \u2014\nAfter weeks of heartbreaking research examining ashtrays and beer y carpets of\nsurrounding pubs, our penetrating team of experts has\nproduced this revealing\nwhite paper on a selection of\nsuch local taverns.\nNow read on \u2014\nSome 200 yards east of\nthe Southside complex are\nthree pubs, known as mews\npubs because of their loc a\"*s3 s mm >.->\ntion in the fashionable cobbled roads of Knightsbridge.\nEnnismore\nIf you walk, the first you'll\nreach will be the Ennismore\nArms with its polite lanterns\nand dimpled windows. It's an unassuming good to average pub having a gambling\nmachine at one end, an apparent necessity these days,\nand a comfortable bay window with seats at the other.\nIts only peculiarity is the\nfact that it has just one bar,\nAbove and below are the two mews\npubs, the Prince of Wales and the\nNelson respectively. Below right is\nthe Hereford Arms in Gloucester\nRoad. All are Watney pubs.\nand that could more aptly be\nlabelled a lounge. Alas, the\nplace sells no draught lager,\nbut does provide snacks for\nthose who want more than\njust drink. A last word \u2022\u2014\nbeware of powerfully sprung\ntoilet doors.\nScurrying through a hole\nin the wall further up the\nmews lane, and taking a right turn, we come across\nthe Prince of Wales. From\nthe outside it has a warm,\ninviting appearance; the tinted Victorian lamps light the\nwrought ironwork and copper fireplace. The only traitors to the illusion are the\nplastic bricks over a gas fire\nin one of the bars. Visitors\nmight note the low piped\nmusic, the Caniletto print\nand the fact that like the\nother mews pubs, it's a Watneys house.\nNelson\nThe Nelson, despite having two bars, is small and,\nas the name suggests, has a slightly nautical atmosphere.\nWooden walls are decorated\nwith ropes and maps and a parish notice board is placed\nby the door. Untypically\nthere's a dart board on one\nwall, and the Nelson is probably the only mews pub\nwhere the landlord wouldn't flinch if you asked him for\nthe dominoes. For those with\ntheir stomachs at heart, the\npub sells both draught lager\nand crisps.\nSouthwest of 1C, not far\nfrom Student House are the\nother three pubs we re-viewed. In the quiet part of\nGloucester Road is the Hereford Arms.\nAnother Watneys house,\nit has rather monotonous\nlilac decor yet is a comfortable pub to spend an even-'\ning. Smokers will find cigarettes are only sold in t wen ties, but this is hardly reason enough to discredit the\nplace. However those who\ndrink simply to get slewed\nwould do best to avoid the\nplace.\nCheap beer\nThe Denmark is a fairly\nlarge pub situated in Old\nBrompton Road. It has three\nbars, all elegantly decorated\nin wood panelling and also\ncontains a restaurant. Unlike\nthat of the mews pubs above,\nthe clientele is younger and\nless inhibited \u2014 making the\npub more attractive to the\naverage student. One other\nunique feature of the pub is\nthe colour TV it has in the\nbar; I suppose it's turned on\nsome times. The beer is\nCourage, and at time of\nwriting a pint of Tavern Keg\nwill cost just 2/8. A fair\nprice for a London pub.\nAnglesea\nA difficult place to find\nbut in my opinion well worth\na visit is The Anglesea\nArms, a stone's throw from\nEvelyn Gardens. The decoration is rough and ready but\nat the weekend the pub is\nfilled with young people, like\nthe Denmark. One attractive\naspect of the place is the relaxed atmosphere; the clientele is very friendly and\nthere's singing and guitar\nplaying on some nights.\nThe inns reviewed above\nare just a sample of the local\nbeer houses. For the connoisseur there are plenty\nmore to try which haven't been considered simply for\nlack of space. Good drinking then \u2014\nBacchus.\nThe Ennismore\nAbove is the lively South Kensington pub, the Anglesea and pictured\nbelow, is the Denmark, in Old\nBrompton Road. Both are conveniently near student house.\n\n"

    "content": "IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION 22nd OCTOBER, 1970 No. 293\nUnion . . .\n. . . meets\nBy normal standards, the first union meeting proper of\nthe new year was a quiet and orderly affair. It began with a statement by Geoff Needham, explaining the situation of\ncar parking in the college, which was answered by Mr. Stephenson. The former suggested that students unable to obtain car parking space inside the college, would be sub sidi sed by those who did, in order to pay for facilities outside the\ncollege. This idea was rejected by Mr. Stephenson, who said\nthat the cost of more security guards, needed to look after\nthe cars, would not be met by this subsidy and the whole\nscheme was financially not feasible. This prompted a further\nsuggestion from Geoff Needham, that the union should sanction the appropriate authorities of the (borough to aid stud-ents, who would be financially handicapped by the introduction of meters outside student houses, which had been\nplanned:\nNext was the more serious business of lodgings and the\ncrisis at the lodgings bureau. W. L.S.A. B., which had been\ndropped owing to the lack of finance, had been re-opened\nby Subk Chatterjee and Janet. Following an advert in the\n'^Evening Standard\", a list of addresses had been compiled,\nbut this is manifestly not enough. What is needed are more\nvolunteers to help run the lodgings bureau. College authorities have agreed to match, pound for pound, our \u00a350 to help\nprovide more lodgings for I.C. students. Further money is\nto be requested from the college, and it is also planned to\ninvite other U.S.K. colleges to contribute towards rebuilding\nW. L.S.A. B. as it was intended \u2014 an area lodgings bureau.\nThe next topic on the agenda was that of refectories. Tony\nKirkham in making a statement about 'this, said that the\nposition was uncertain. The ensuing discussion was, to put\nit mildly, clouded with uncertainty. However, the general\nline was as follows.\nLetter Judith Walker was supposed to have received a letter\n(which she didn't), from the rector i rf forming her of the\nEmergency catering sub-committee's decision to convert the\nAnte-Room into a waitress service refectory. However, it\nhad also been planned to turn the Ante-Room into an Art\ngallery, and the college had received a grant amounting to\n\u00a3300 towards this. She said that we should demand an end\nto the former on 26th October, when a new waitress service\nrefectory is due to open, and that we should submit a long\nterm plan, which would, amongst other things, help stop\nthe profit-loss cycle which has dogged the refectories since\ntheir opening about twenty years ago. (They lost around\n\u00a328,000 this year!) to the special refectory committee due\nto meet shortly, with the rector in the chair.\nMr. Stephenson said that the Ante-Room had been turned\ninto a waitress service refectory at the request of the Students\nrefectory committee; this was hotly denied by Judith Walker.\nThis had been done because, with the closure of the Union\nwaitress service refectory, students had complained that they\nhad no place to entertain their friends visiting the college.\nGradually certain questions came to light. (1) Why was the\ndecision to move the waitress service to the Ante-Room an\nemergency decision? (2) Why was the Ante-Room which is\none of the few communal rooms in the college block, chosen?\n(3) Why is there such a lack of flow of information between\nthe staff and the student refectories committees? Surely,\nwith a better exchange of information, problems like this\nwould be avoided.\nOTC\nNext business was the \"O.T.C. and U.L. U. air squadron\nfresher s stall affair\". Judith Walker had refused to allow\nNew heads at IC\nThe first week of 'this year's Freshers' Dinners in the Union has provided the usual\nvaried collection of irresponsible acts; from the wildness of\nChem Eng to the drunkenness\nof Mines.\nThe Aero dinner of Monday 12th went without incident until 23.00 when R.C.S. supporters decided to clear\nthe bar by use of the fire\nhose. Although this did indeed empty the bar, the\nsoaked occupants were not\nso amused.\nPiano Smashing\nThursday 15th was the day\nof the Chem Eng dinner,\nwhich has a quire da bad\nreputation over the past few\nyears. Although C.& G.U. officials tried to maintain order\nsome students decided to\nbounce down the stairs to\nthe bar the new secondhand\npiano from the 'Senior Common Room. Through jumping up and down on the\npiano, they cracked the keyboard cover. More Guildsmen had to have a go at the\nLower Lounge piano \u2014 this\nwas locked, but while playing\nabout they managed to break\noff a hammer! Overall, despite the large number of\nbroken glasses, the dinner\nwas calmer than in previous\nyears.\nThe following night the\nMining Dinner happened.\nDespite their reputation as\nbeer drinkers, many present\ncould not hold down their\nliquor. The Union bar toilet,\nin particular, was left in a disgusting state \u2014 barman\nBrendon Clements has never\nseen it in such a mess. Also,\nwhen one of the cleaners went\ninto the Dining Hall next\nmorning, she was made ill by\nthe smell!\nSelkirk Bingo\nAfterwards, Minesmen\ncaused some nuisance in the\nvicinity of Southside, and\nMr. Seafood was seen in\nPrinces Gardens playing Selkirk Bingo (what, again???)\nafter five empty Party Four\ncans were thrown out of 462\nSelkirk. There are rumoured\nto 'have been 22 people in that\nroom when the aforementioned and be-dressing-gowned\nMr. Seafood tried to calm\nthe Minesmen down.\nThe Governing Body of the\nImperial College of Science\nand Technology has elected\nfive new Fellows of the Imperial College who will receive their scrolls of Fellowship at the annual Commemoration Day Ceremony\nin the Royal Albert Hall on\nThursday, 22nd October,\n1970.\nProfessor R.N.

Glossop, BSc,\nFICE, MI MM, FGS, Director of John Mowlem and\nCompany until his retirement\nin 1968 and now consultant\nRemember how those heroic Constituent Colleges stoically took a10 per cent cut\nin their grant estimates at\nJoint Council last session?\nNow, with a changed composition of Council, R. C.S.U. and R. S.M.U. decided to submit \"revised estimates\". No\nguesses which way their estimates would be revised\u2014despite the fact that fantastically increased I.C. Bookshop\nprofits mean that Constituent\nColleges have more money\nthis year than ever before.\nAt the time of going to\npress, a lively debate on the\nsubject was expected at last\nMonday's I.C.U. Council\nmeeting\u2014further report in\nFELICITY. As Mooney's prices make\ntheir annual increase, FELIX is pleased to announce the\nresults of an expedition to\nGreasy Pete's.

Her reasons for doing\nthis were a mixture of good and bad. Firstly, she said that\nthere would not have been space for them, which is fair\nenough, and secondly that they were a \"paramilitary organ-is ation\". So what? Surely it is the Union's decision, not hers?\nThe Union were in sound disagreement with the president,\nand a motion was passed to invite them to set up a stall\nnext year.\nThe time was nearing 2:30, when Piers Corbyn read a lengthy motion about college hours, which have been in\ncreased, which few people, if any, understood.

Under a piece entitled \"FELIX CONDONES APARTHEID\", the anonymous publishers accuse\nthe staff of \"callous disregard for basic human rights\" Their\njustification for this accusation, is the fact that we published\na Barclays Bank advert, in the last issue; C.E.F. E. might\nnote that there is one in this issue as well.\nIn fact, the \"trivial financial inducement\" that they men-tion, is simply untrue. In this issue, the Barclays Bank\nadvert, alone makes up nearly 80 per cent of our external\nprinted advertising and provides about half of our external\nincome, without which incidentally, FELIX couldn't con-tin ue. If I felt that FELIX could afford to survive without\nsuch classes of adverising, then I would agree to solidarity\nwith N.U.S. on this issue, but at present, it is simply a matter\nof economics.\nNaked Women\nWhich leads me on to the advertising situation in general.\nBig firms are beginning to deliberately neglect advertising\nin student newspapers for a number of reasons. One is that\nthey have rediscovered the relative worth of national advertising but another is due to bad feeling towards students\nin general. Hence this short eight-page issue of FELIX,\nand the meagre 18 column inches of external advertising it\ncontains.\nFreshers attending last Thursday's union meeting couldn't have been very impressed with what they saw. By last year's standards, the meeting was slow and uneventful\u2014motions\nappeared petty and people began walking out before time.\nWhy this should happen at the first Union meeting of the\nterm is difficult to explain. In point of fact, very few fresher s attended the meeting anyway. Perhaps I.C. is entering a new dimension of apathy\u2014total non-participation. But seri-ou sly, I.C. needs the variety and experience that a full\nUnion meeting provides\u2014and in the same way, FELIX\nneeds the headlines.\nFELIX\nAs a final point in this rather hasty editorial, it must be\nemphasized that FELIX welcomes all letters, feature articles,\nnews reports and photos of general interest to students. No\nparticular literary talent is required to write copy, which\nis topical or expresses an opinion. However FELIX does\nhave an early copy date and features for the next issue\nshould be in this coming Saturday. For further details,\ncome to a press meeting, Tuesday or Thursday lunchtime in\nthe press room.\nLetters to the Editor United\nwe kneel\nDear Sir,\nI would like to complete\nthe picture portrayed in\nrather an off-beat fashion by\none of my publicity secretaries in his article entitled\n'Let's be positive'. The fact\nis that the Christian Union\nis a group of serious-minded\nstudents who are united by\ntheir common faith. Admittedly one of our aims is to\npresent the truths that we\nhave discovered about Jesus\nChrist to the College as a whole. We do this because\nwe feel they contain a message which can be of benefit to all who are prepared\nto consider them, hence our\nseries 'One Way'. On the\nother hand the C.U. aims to\nhelp its members to strengthen and grow in their\nChristian lives. I trust that\nwe present an overall picture of sincere people, concerned for the whole College,\nto all who come in contact\nwith us.\nYours faithfully,\nDavid Goodall,\n(President, I.C.C. U.)

Union, in which she refuses to allow the OTC and UL U Air Squadron to be present at the Freshers Fair.\nThe views expressed are purely personal and we and\nmany others at I.C. feel that in a supposedly free society\ndecisions of this nature should be taken by the Union as a whole and not by one individual.\nWe would very much have welcomed the presence of these\ntwo bodies and hope that they will be present next year.\nYours faithfully,\nT.J.

If anyone feels they would\nlike to serve the community in a social sphere we organise\nactivities ranging from regular tutoring of West Indian\nchildren to improve their English, reading to blind students,\ntape-recording books for the blind, to soup runs at night\nin the East End (in conjunction with the St. Mungo Community) and weekend work parties decorating for old people,\nwhich do not require a regular weekly commitment. We\nalso organise an emergency blood do ning service amongst\nhall residents, and there are general blood do ning sessions\nin 'the Union in November and May.\nSocial work is usually great fun, and helps widen one's outlook and prevents becoming too college-orientated.\nAnyone interested in doing any of this work should contact\nPat Ryall, Physics III, Andrew Dean, Chem Eng II or\nmyself.\n\" Yours faithfully,\nLesley Pattinson\n92 Beit Hall\nInt. 2799\nDear Sir,\nThis letter is prompted by\nthe refusal of Miss Judith\nWalker, on behalf of I.C. Union, to permit recruiting\nfacilities to the University of\nLondon O.T.C. and Air Squadron at the Freshers\nDay Fair.\nDoes Miss Walker really\nthink that the students of\nthis college are so badly\neducated, that they are incapable of seeing the full implications of membership of\nthese two military sponsored\nsocieties?\nIs she prepared to believe\nthat the \"lures\" of free flying and bounties, offered by\nthe Air Squadron and\nO.T.C., are sufficient to blind\nthe intellectual elite \u2014 be\nthey fresher s or not \u2014 to the\ndeep commitments in vol ved?\nSurely in a free academic\nsociety the right of. choice\nlies with the individual.\nOnce any part of the University is prevented access to\nfunctions, on the moral beliefs of a minority, freedom\nof choice is denied.\nYours faithfully,\nKris Robinson\nElec.

Tuesdays and\nThursdays you can cope with\nlike last year by not going\nto General Studies, or, if\nthat's not boring enough, you\ncan intensify your inactivity\nto include not going to Union\nMeetings as well. But what\nabout the rest of the week.\nYou may even have considered occasionally doing something for fear of spoiling your\napathy pa letter by over-exposure\u2014if so, a suggestion:\nAmbiance Lunch-Time\nTheatre Club's two one-act\nplays (Tt Bees Dat Way' and\n'Arrest\") daily 1.15\u20142.0 at\nI.C.A., Nash House, The\nMall.\nIn the first play, the small\nwhite audience is incited to\nviolence and/or reduced by\nthe smaller but sexier black\noas t. The latter (having the\nadvantage of knowing whether there is a script, and who\nis actor and who merely got\nfree tickets on the pretext of\nreviewing the thing) manage\nto reduce the former to an\nembarrassed crocodile shuffling uncertainly towards the\nexit.\nEnd of play one.\nNow a policeman appears,\nenlists everyone as special\nconstables, complete with\nuniforms, and, ignoring prods\nand ^Say are you real's' from\nthe bolder elements, sends\nthem back to the auditorium\nto 'raid' the Obscene play\ntaking place there . . . gradually the audience realized that\nit is now in the second play\nbut is more concerned with\ni the injustices it finds itself\ncommitting in the name of\n'censorship'. . .\nand flops\nEmerson Lake & Palmer,\nsupposed to be playing at\nBrunei last Saturday, took\none look at the surroundings\nand decided to go home to\nMother\u2014which was why a lot of people turned up at\nI.C. Hop. The S.U. card\ncheckers in the Union Arch\nvaliantly fought off this in-surge of undesirable aliens\nby installing a moat of beer\nbetween the snack-bar and\nthe Union office, and slinking\noff to watch the security\nguards' television. The inefficiency of these methods was\nfortunately matched only by\ntheir short-sightedness in failing to notice that most of the\nal liens were not undesirable,\nbut FEMALE. Food\nVenturing into Ithe Union\nclutching a future programme\nfor Ents, there was an immediate confrontation with\nDramsoc attempting to sell\ntickets and Ents trying to\nconduct a Spanish inquisition\nusing an imported foreign\ncorrespondent who wished\nto know where you had come\nfrom, and other personal\nquestions. At the same time\nHenry added to the confusion\nby showing a thing film and\nhaving a sale of what they\nhelpfully claimed to be\nFOOD. The significance of\nthe latter was realised on\nentering the Concert Hall, for\nthe bevy of birds seen arriving appeared both to have\nchanged sex and reverted to\n1-964 (see photo). Rapidly\nbecoming disheartened an\nexpedition was organised to\na non-existent party.\nPresident's piece\nThe president's life is a constant round of committees\u2014or so it sometimes\nseems, moan. Participation\nhas come to mean bureau-c racy, as the administration\ninstead of merely implementing policy decided by the\ncommunity, plays power poli-tics. Instead of a community\nthere are various groups most\nwith their own unions. Part\nof the function of a students\nunion is as a trade union.\nRepresentative participation\ndoes not just mean me or\nany other bureaucrat trotting\nalong to a select number of\nmeetings\u2014it means you, ready\nto take the initiative for a change.

Departments do not change by college edict.\nThere are many non academic staff appointments\n(e.g. Hall Wardens, Senior\nWarden, Domestic Bursar) in\nwhich we have no say.

There are simply no\nstudent reps on such important bodies as the Growth\nPoints Committee. The danger is of course being sucked\ninto committees to the extent\nthat the union officers are\nseen to be involved in bad\ndecisions, a devious tactic.\nCommittees advise (e.g. see\nthe Refectory Committee and\nwhat can happen with advisory bodies), and their existence is in some cases a sham.\nThere is a smoke screen of\napparent student part ic ipa tion, whilst in fact the decisions are reached after mock\nconsultation. Be aware!\nWith the college hours increased to allow for more\nflexibility in timetabling and\nthus partly facilitate the in-it n ro duct ion of associated\nstudies, we have the opportunity to broaden courses.\nNot just tacked on \"liberal\nstudies\", but by easing out\nthe unnecessary 'technical detail in our courses, to integrate non-technical studies as\ncredit carrying options.\nThere are too many ignorant experts. 'Science is\naction and therefore unable\nto sidestep its social and\npolitical role. Associated\nstudies should not be yet\nanother lecture course but a vital part of a divers fie d de-g ree. Projects, such as Electrical Engineering has develop-ed, are one way of introducing the community to science.\nSpecialisation leads to communication breakdown.\nWe live in isolation, blind to\nother students, yet I.C. is part\nof the national student move-ment. The recent abuse of\nconspiracy charges by the\nlaw (e.g. Liverpool, Cambridge, London Senate\nHouse) places our freedom\nmore into jeopardy than does\nany demo. Our only strength\nis our solidarity.\nBarclay's Bank has become\na symbol, an expression of\nBritain's economic interests\nin furthering white supremacy in southern Africa. The\nboycott expresses opposition\nto the Cobora Bassa dam\nscheme. There are other ways\nto oppose South African\napartheid, but more insidious is the racial is m expressed here. Relate to the community\u2014look at Notting Hill\n\u2014problems, slums, but at\nleast capable of developing\na community spirit (unlike\nsterile South Ken.) and as\nstudents, later as scientists,\nwe should contribute.\nMore patriotism in the next\nissue. Meanwhile I.C.U. News\nwill keep you informed and\nunion meetings keep us\nactive.\nBalls\nApart from a couple of\nballs-up with putting the\nlights on at the wrong time,\nFilm Society members and\nguests were relieved to find\nan improved standard of projection and sound last Friday. Chris Hanna, the Society's projectionist, had discovered a poor contact in the\npre-amp of one projector,\nwhich precluded a report of\nthe previous week's sizzling\nsound. Further improvements\nmay be expected next week\nwith the purchase of a new\nprojector.

Brunei University 8 pts.\nWith most of last season's Cupwinners back in the side,\nI.C. fielded a useful team at\nUxbridge last Wednesday\n14th. Full back Pudney (a7 th year Civ Eng student and\nNorfolk full back) opened\nthe scoring by kicking two\ngood penalties. Brunei countered by scoring a scrappy\ntry which the I.C. defence\nmust take the blame for, but\nsoon after Roy Anderson\nwent over in the corner for\nhis usual try.\n9 pts\u20145 pts. was the score\nat half time with I.C. obviously well on top, winning set sc rummages and\nlines-out quite tidily, but being very scrappy in the loose\nruc ks. Pre-season lack of fitness prevented great deeds in\nthe second half with the pack\nlagging towards the end.\nHowever a good try was\nscored by Alan Roberts\nfrom a move started by\nskipper Kip Conolly \u2014\nthese two combining well\nthroughout the game. The\nrest of the I.C. points came\nfrom the boot of Pudney\nwhose kicking was super-lat ive,9 out of 9 kicks going\nover.\nA good start, but fitness\nis essential to gain good ball\nfor the I.C. backs who look\nlike being very useful this\nseason. Also good performances from the two fresher s in the side, Roy Morns and\nJon Hunt.\nTeam: R. Pudney, R. Anderson, W. Baines, D. Conolly (capt.), K. Devany,\nA. Roberts, J. Abbott, D. Amos, P.

The main\nquestion still to be answered\nis whether the second team\nwill be strong enough to\nstay in the First Division of\nthe London Colleges Cross\nCountry League, a task\nwhich may be accomplished\nby good attendance rather\nthan by good running.\nApart from the League,\nother interesting matches\nheld this term will include\nthe Priory Relays at Reigate,\nthe Osterley Park Relay and\nthe London University\nChampionships. There will\nalso be the usual multi-cornered / inter-college fixtures and attractive away\ntrips to Norwich and Bristol.\nThe success and liveliness\nof the club could be improved by new members.\nStandards in the club, and\nindeed throughout London\ncolleges, vary from international to pub crawlers!\nQuotation from the secretary: \"Had a good one to dav \u2014 came 837th\"(1970 Nationals).\nTwo of last year's mem-be rs, Norman Morrison and\nBarry Jones, represented\nScotland and New Zealand\nrespectively in the Edinburgh\nCommonwealth Games. Norman was eliminated in\nthe heats of the 1500 metres\nevent, while Barry was midway back in the marathon.\nMeanwhile Bob Jensen has\ngone out to Nigeria for a couple of years (out of the\nway) and Eth Himsworth is\nsomewhere in the North Sea.\nRod Brook and Tony Carter were last heard of in\nCanada.\nHOCKEY\nI.C. Hockey\nThe first trial was held on\nWednesday, 7th October at\nHarlington and attended by\nsome twenty-five fresher s. Although the conditions\nwere far from ideal- many of\nthem showed a great deal\nof promise and enthusiasm\nfor the coming season.\nHowever, we are certainly\nin need of more players, so\nI shall be grateful if any\nfresher, whether or not he\nvisited us on fresher s' day,\nwho is still interested in\nplaying would contact a member of the committee as\nsoon as possible.\nJ.B. Sargent, Room 664,\nSelkirk; J.D. Manning,\nPhysics; D. Richman, Room\n51 Weeks; T. Hewan,\nR.S. M.;R. Palmer, Room\nThere are no less than 23\nsporting clubs operating\nunder the auspices of A.C.C. These vary from the traditional ones such as rugby,\nsoccer and hockey, to rather\nmore sophisticated ones such\nas tenpin bowling, ski-ing,\nlacrosse and judo.\nI.C. sport has much to live\nup to this year after last ses-sion's sweeping victories. The\nA.F.C. l st XI won the University League Cup, their\n2nd XI won both their cup\nand League competitions\nand even the 6th XI won\ntheir Cup competition. The\nsoccer club also had a successful tour of Germanv.\nThe RFC XV won trie\nGutteridge Cup (the U.L. Competition) and enjoyed a successful tour of Belgium.\nThe Hockey club didn't win\nany silverware last year, but\nhad a good session culminating in a tour of Holland.\nThe Boat Club had their\nusual successful year, months\nof hard training culminating\nin various successes at Henley. The cricket club won the\nUniversity cup yet again and\nsav our ed some strange beers\non their club tour of Devon\nand Cornwall. The crosscountry club produced some\nextremely fine athletes last\nthrashed\nI.C.l st XI 9, QEC 1\nIn this pre-league friendly\nagainst QE C last Wednesday\n14th, I.C. put in no less than\nnine goals! Fielding a very\nstrong side, containing\nBakerwell as the only\nFresher in goal, they proved\ntoo strong for our Camden\nHill neighbours.\nThe side as a whole played\nwell but the game was\nmarred by a knee injury to\ndefender Paul Worthington\nwho was replaced by Masiin.\nMention must be made of\nstriker Tony Holland who\nbagged 5 goals no less. The\nother scorers were Willcock\n(1), Willey (1), Kelly (1) and\neven Darley appeared from\nnowhere to head in a very\ngood goal!\nA good start \u2014 bodes well\nfor the U.L. league yet again.\nTeam: Bakewell, Worthington, Fryer, Willcock, J. Darley, Barnard, Willey,\nHolland, McArdle, Dixon\n(Capt.), Kelly.\nyear who gained top class\nhonours, reflecting the current strength of the club.\nICWSC in all departments\nwere very strong considering\ntheir relative lack of mem-be rs, perhaps the hockey\nclub being most successful.\nLawn tennis for once\ndidn't win the UL cup, but\ndid everything else. The\nswimming club had a fine\nseason, possessing a very\nstrong and experienced water\npolo team. The standard of\nsquash at I.C. reached its\nhighest level yet last year,\nand this must be the college's fastest growing sport.\nOther clubs, such as golf,\nfencing, sailing, volleyball,\ntable tennis and ten pin\nbowling all had good fixture\nlists and are all strong in\nstandard and depth. We wish\nluck to the two new clubs\nin A.C.C. viz. lacrosse and\nski-ing.\nJust watch the club notice\nboards in the UNION for\ninformation regarding teams,\nsocial events etc., and make\nyour club the club this year.\n7, Weeks.\nThe team made a good\nstart to the season by winning all the preliminary\nrounds and beating U.C. in\nthe final.\nThis was followed by a fine win against Sussex University on Wednesday, 14th Oct. Although Sussex started\nwell, a strong I.C. attack\nfound gaps in their defence\nand accurate shooting by\nLynne Beynon gave the team\na4 \u20140 lead at half-time.\nDuring the second half\ngeneral un fitness caused the\nteam to flag but a goal by\nBrenda Dilley brought the\nfinal score to 5-0.\nTeam: R. Newton; M. Diggens; J. Manfield; M. Dafferson; M. Lewis; A. Purvis; B. Dilley; S. Thompson; L. Beynon; H. Rowson;\nC. Culshaw.\nVolleyball\nThis year the Volleyball\nClub has entered teams in\ntwo leagues. The stiffest test\nwill come in the National\nLeague Division 2 (Southern\nArea) to which we gained\npromotion last year.\nThe second team will be\nplaying in the SEE TECH Volleyball League on Wednesday afternoons, and stand\na better chance of success\nthan the first team!\nIn the coming year we\nhope to build a team\nworthy of our national\nstatus, so we can attract an\nincreased membership in\nfuture years.\nEDITORIAL\nBY THE time you peruse this rather hurried piece of\njournalism (?) those of you new to college will have realised\nwhat a strong bastion of sport IC is! The huge and ponderous\nmachinery of ACC has clicked smoothly into gear and most\nclubs have either played their first few matches or are well\ninto their training programmes.\nAs may be gathered from the article elsewhere on this\npage on the past record of the clubs, a great tradition of\nsporting successes is to be found here. Hence our magnificent\nfacilities, there is the sports centre at Harlington and the\nboat house at Putney. However what is important is the sporting circles of IC in that these facilities are available to anyone and everyone, whatever standard one's sporting activities\nare. The social activities of most of the ACC clubs are wide\nand diverse, catering to the most perverted tastes! This is\nwhat university sport \u2014 and perhaps university life is all\nabout. A sense of involvement and participation is a must if\nthe average student wants to lead a full life.\nSo everyone, especially the fresher s, don't be put off by\nthe shouts of sportsmen being called reactionaries, Union bar\nclique and all other puerile tabs bandied about, sport is for\nall, male and female, black and white, hair ies and non-hair ies. Sport is the greatest social level ler available and whatever politicians say, an utter destroyer and enemy of pre-jud ice. So enjoy it to the full while you have both the\nfaculties and the facilities.\nAll Results and Articles to be sent to\nMike Adams (Falmouth 248 or Chemistry)\nby Thursday morning\none week before\npublication\nAdvertise your Club \u2014\nFor FREE\nAthletic Club\nIC athletic club has made a good start to the year by\nrecruiting a good crop of fresher s, several of whom must\nbe destined for greater things.\nAs well as providing a stepping stone to inter-university\ncompetition with UL U, the club itself has a succession of\nfixtures which this year should be well attended. Obviously\nmost meetings take place in the Summer term, but the season ends well before exam time.\nAnyone still welcome to join can contact me via the\nChemistry letter rack in the old building or by internal phone\nno. 2697.\nSTEVE FLETCHER RESULTS\nThe following results were available at the time of\ngoing to press.\nWednesday, October 14th I.Cl st XI9; Q.E.
