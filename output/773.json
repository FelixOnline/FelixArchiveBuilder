    "content": "Reviews. FELIX, Friday May29 th198710 IC\nENTS\nComedy\nNight\n<\nX The first act I saw that night was well\nand truly off putting. They were so\ndreadful that I can't even remember\nwhat they were called\u2014the only thing\nthat sticks in my mind is the sound\nof booing as they went into their third\nchorus of \"Daddy wouldn't buy me\na bow wow\", and the booing was far\nmore tuneful than the singing.\nAt the end of the act I was about\nready to leave, and I reckon the rest\nof the crowd were in the same state,\nbut by common consensus we decided\nto give the next act a chance, and just\nas well. Two gallant members of\nENTS. who shall remain nameless,\ncom and ee red the stage complete with\nguitars and gave us fifteen most\nworthwhile minutes of obscenity and\nrough and ready music which well\noutclassed the previous lot\u2014credit\nmust go to these people for saving the\nevening.\nHaving held onto the crowd,\npreventing mass exodus, our heroes\nleft the stage to Tom McEwan, who\nwas fantastic. His opening number\nseemed a bit doubtful, with fair guitar\nplaying and mucho gut so on the\nmouth organ, but from then on he just\ngot better, giving us a superb line in\ndry Scots humour and a good\nselection of music, illustrating quite\na talent on both instruments and\ncoping very well with the one idiot\nwho had to heckel. At the end of his\nspot he was called back by loud roars\nfor an encore, and all I can say is that\nRomeo and Juliet will never sound the\nsame again.\nAfter the excellent Mr McEwan it\nlooked as if the last act, Steve\nRawlings, had a tough one to follow,\nbut he did it. The best way of\ndescribing him is as a juggler with the\noo per touch for mayhem:\ngetting it wrong to order is probably\nharder than getting it right, and Steve\ndid his share of both. The culmination\nof his act involved fire and wine\nglasses, eliciting ooh s and a ahs all\nover the place and leaving his\nassistant lost for words. He too was\ncalled back for more, and he didn't disappoint.\nSumming up, we had an excellent\ntime, only marred at the start by those\nmusic hall twits, who deserved a much nastier reception than they got.\nFull marks, ENTS!\nAndrew Bannister\nA Heron\ncomes\nto work\nWho misdirected this early morning Commuter?\nSomewhere between the Serpentine\nAnd St James' it had turned right\nWhen it should have kept its slow\nLaboured line.\nBut it flopped thump, bump into the glass screen\nBeyond my desk.\nIt had been mobbed\nRobbed, raped more like it\nBy a gang of crows.\nInexpressibly alien:\nAll morning long,\nFrom log-on time to coffee\nIt sulked. Chin on breast, shoulders hunched\nFrom it tormentors\nIn a corner of the concrete yard,\nLike a masai warrior in a bus station,\nWhite riffling against the grey\nCurrents of its neck\nIts breast.\nThe hard bead of its eye\nClicking.\nAll morning long,\nIt took in management science lectures,\nNuclear power seminars, the mixed chaff\nOf undergraduates between classes, until\nThe windows began to open too often\nAnd the voices rang out too loudly. Then\nIt rose, swaying over the narrowed street.\nWould that passers-by had hid\nFrom its en our mou s shadow.\nWould that the street had stopped\nTo gasp 'Ah',\nBut I doubt it did.\nAnita Kushwat, Mech Eng\n23rd May 1987 c The Sex Pistols\u2014The Inside Story\nby Fred & Judy Vermorel\nOmnibus Press, \u00a35.95\nWas it really only ten years ago? This\nbook is the nearest the Sex Pistols got\nto telling their own story (where have\nI heard that before?) and includes\ninterviews, press cuttings and extracts\nfrom the Sex Pistols' secretary's diary. The first half of the book deals\nwith \"The Story\"\u2014the early days,\nthe Grundy interview, signing to\nEMI, signing to A&M, signing to\nVirgin, getting Sid Vicious, losing\nDRUGS 'N Sid, and then killing off the group.\nThere is then a section on the\ncharacters involved\u2014extracts from\nPaul Cook's school reports, and\nphotos of Sid Vicious as a kid at the\nzoo, and then a 'What a wonderful\nyear that was' piece lamenting the\ndeath of punk.\nThe best parts of the book are those\nthat deal with Malcolm Maclaren, Sex\nROCK N Pistol's manager/sven gali, simply\nbecause he is the most interesting\ncharacter involved. Otherwise, one is\nleft with the impression that the\nauthors are on a crusade to make the\nrest of the band into something they\nnever were\u2014spokesmen for a generation.\nPaul Cook and Steve Jones come\nover as just a couple of guys doing\nSEX Na job, Sid as a rather naive, but\noptimistic junkie, Glen Matlock (their\nfirst bassist) as a victim of John\nLydon, and Lydon (ne Rotten) is just\nanother pop star with a personality\nproblem. The diary extracts give us\nlots of incidental information (Lydon\nwas hounded by his dentist, Sid was\n'a really sweet guy', Glen Matlock\nbought a Sunbeam Alpine car), but\nROLL\nnothing new, nothing that has not\nalready been written into the history\nof that year.\nThis is a book, then, aimed at fans,\nor fanatics\u2014interesting but not\ncrucial. \"The majority of men and\nwomen live their lives in quiet\ndesperation, The Sex Pistols lived\ntheir lives in loud desperation.\"\nPete Wilson\n\n"

    "content": "Letters. FELIX, Friday May 29th1987 GaySoc\nDefended\nDear Dave,\nWhy are students at this College so\nparanoid about homosexuality?\nHomosexuality has always been\npresent in our society and\nundoubtedly it will continue to be so.\nIf we acknowledge or accept\nhomosexuals as a part of our society\nwill it corrupt us all? Are we going\nto become 'bent' because we hear a gay song, see a gay play, read a gay\nbook or. my God. actually meet a ga\\\nperson?\nThe establishment of a GaySoc at\nIC should be supported for 2 reasons:\n1. It provides a supportive outlet for\ngay students to express themselves.\n2. With time (centuries?) it should\nbe seen by all IC students as just\nanother society which caters for the\ninterests of a minority (ArtSoc exists\nto give theatre-lovers the chance to\n'come out' and say they enjoy going\nto see Shakespeare. Hopefully they\nare not classified as abnormal just\nbecause some IC student's idea of a good night out is 16 pints of lager,\nav in da loo and a voluminous\nthrow-up).\nSince leaving the ignorant shores of\nIreland (where, as you know,\neverybody lives in big happy families\nwith at least 13 children and\nhomosexuality does not even exist) I have been constantly shocked by\nreports of child abuse, wife-battering,\nrape within marriage, incest, child\nprostitution, pae do philia, abortion\nand divorce. These, Mr Thomis, are\nthe horrifying threats to 'the family\nunit' in our society today, not\nhomosexuality.\nI hope to God that people of our age\nand education can see the difference\nbetween acts of sexual violence and\nexpressions of sexuality.\nYours sincerely,\nDavid Currey, Software\nEngineering (Chairman of\nArtSoc)\nPrejudice\nAttacked\nDear Dave,\nI would like to add my 2p worth to\nthe 'gay-rights' debate. People have\nprejudices. The mood around College\nat the moment is that these are in some\nway wrong\u2014a sickness to be cured.\nI do not agree with this. People eat\nmeals and enjoy them\u2014but when they\nare told what was in it, they change\ntheir mind\u2014a result of human\nprejudice. We all know what we find\nattractive in the people we meet\u2014and\nwe all exercise our prejudices in\nsifting friends from our a quaint ances. 'Homophobia' and racism are\nprejudices which are unpopular\nbecause most people cannot\nsym pathis e with them. However if a racist wishes to avoid the company of\nthe races he dislikes then good for\nhim, because to attempt to overcome\nhis feelings would create tension and\ndifficulties\u2014and the same goes for\n'homophones'. When these people go\nout 'queer bashing' or 'nigger\nbashing' is when it all become\nabhorrent.\nOpen expression of prejudice is\noften damaging and hurtful, but the\nfeelings themselves are not. The\n! biggest mistake of the lot is to attempt\n; to ignore or fight our prejudices.\nAndrew Allum\nI Phvsics I Procreation\nRevisited\nDear Dave,\nThe arguments over the rights and\nwrongs in the \"gay rights\" issue\ncontinue. We do at least seem to have\nsome agreement that sex and love are\ndifferent things and that it is possible\nfor sexual desire to be inappropriate.\nIt is surely true, I would add, that\nsimply because we are in love with\nsomeone we cannot treat all possible\nresultant physical actions towards that\nperson as true and appropriate\nexpressions of our love; some can\ndefinitely be quite the opposite.\nAs I have argued before (May 15th)I certainly don't think the evaluation\nof the Tightness or wrongness of\nanything (especially where there is\ndispute and we propose to publicly\npush our ideas) can proceed purely\nfrom the basis of personal experience\nwithout attempting to reasonably\nbecome a bit more 'sure' (ref Andrew\nBannister May 22nd) that our feelings\nare good and ordered. Even (indeed\nespecially) 'love' itself, if we really\nbelieve it is more than the\nmeaningless result of some random\natom barging, should not I think be\nlet loose to be talked about and\nnurtured just in the context of the\napparent 'instincts' of individuals.\nPerhaps the sheer biological\npurpose of sex, that is for procreation\n(something very clearly acknowledged in the life cycles of the animal\nkingdom), is something we should\nbring into the discussion. Procreation\nis of course inherent to the survival\nof the special and so, for the\nevolutionists among us, this purpose\nexplains the physical pleasure\nassociated with sex. Human beings of\ncourse bring in the infinitely higher\nlevel of love, but in noting that we\nshould also be careful to note that we\ncan certainly beautifully express love\nand become very close to a person\nwithout having to use the particular\nphysical expression which is having\nsex with him/her/them (or even\nexperiencing sexual desire\u2014though it\nmay, perhaps inappropriately and\nregret ably, force it's way in). Love\ndoes not depend upon any particular\nphysical expression. Perhaps, then,\nwe can see sex in the human species\nas, by design, an expression of love\nwhich wants to create (and so bring\nup) another person\u2014a completely\ncommitted and totally unselfish love\nthat is\u2014crowned with the physical\npleasure which is there, after all,\nbecause the act is that which\nprocreates. Sex outside of this\ncontext, then, can become an untruth.\nA lack of love or of the procreative\npotential places the sexual pleasure\noutside of the context of what it\nmeans, of what it says.\nIf we really believe in the existence\nand value of human love and want to\nshare true love I submit that some of\nthe above considerations are relevant.\nYours sincerely,\nHugh MacKenzie. Civ Eng RA\nRCSU:\nHacking Itself\nto Bits?\nDear Dave,\nSad though it is to have to air one's dirty laundry in public the question\nhas to be asked. What has RCSU done\nto itself?\nA once proud and happy union has\nbeen plummet ted to the depths of\nshattered egos, petty bickering and\nworst of all, it's losing any sense of\nhumour.\nThis year has seen a series of\nattacks from certain prominent RCSU\nofficers (and non-officers) on a group\nof people who have, on the whole,\nhad no means of reply. Their general\ngood nature has meant that they\nhaven't really been bothered and the\nattacks aren't really going to change\ntheir lives. However, what type of\nimage is all this vitriolic backstabbing giving the RCSU; it's not\nexactly showing it to be a bundle of\nlaughs is it? Who is going to get\ninvolved with a group of people who\nspend their whole time s lagging each\nother off in public?\nOver the months we have seen\nnumerous attacks on so called hacks,\nboth old and new. Can I point out to\nthese 'non-hacks' that without the\nsupport of these people, especially the\nolder variety, there would have been\nno drivers for Rag Tour, the Smoking\nConcert would have lost some of its\nbest acts, their would have been\nnobody to clean after many of the\nmajor events of the year. Many of\nthese people were the ones who kept\nthe 1,000,001 darts going and Jez\nwould have stayed in her garage until\nafter Easter if it wasn't for them. I could go on but what's the point? The\npeople who have initiated this hate\ncampaign are set in their ways\nthey've got it into their minds from\nsomewhere that 'hacks' are a bad\nidea. It's pointless explaining what\nhas been there to be seen by anyone\nwho cared enough to look the\ncontroversy over.\n\"Not Broadsheet\" is just another\nexample of the way the life blood of\nRCSU is blackening. Over a number\nof years, the helpers on Broadsheet\nhave produced the occasional spoof-issue, the purpose of which has been\njust for a little fun at the end of the\nyear.\nSome of us, this year, decided it\nwould be quite a novel surprise to ask\none of the most notable of the recent\npast editors to edit this special edition.\nGiven the noticeable absence this\nterm, of Broadsheet, it was felt that\na number of things had to be said\nbefore many students disappeared\nafter/before exams. The publication\nwasn't meant to offend; quite the\ncontrary, it went out of its way to\npraise the official editor. As to\nwhether the principle was\nconstitutional, the content of\nBroadsheet is at the (official) editor's discretion, and thus not at her dictate.\nIt is appreciated that some of the\nmaterial was controversial, however,\nif a publication goes out of its way not\nto offend anyone, it soon becomes\nvery stagnant and obviously boring.\nBecause a number of people on IC\nCouncil share a particular belief, it is\nautomatically assumed that other\ngroups with opposing points of view\nshould keep silent, and that an v mention of such opinions is strictly\ntaboo. I don't believe this to be true.\nHaving read this week's official\nBroadsheet and heard the judgements\nof the RCS president and president-elect, and also having talked to many\n'average' students, I believe the\npublication of Not Broadsheet was\njustified. In fact general support for\nit was positive, perhaps the powers\nthat be should think carefully about\nthis discontinuity. The current\nhier achy promised to change RCSU,\nthey seem to be doing quite nicely.\nThat much vaunted war-horse, the\nconstitution says RCSU should\n' 'promote social intercourse between\nstudents\", and also ex-students. The\nonly change that has been brought is\nsadly towards social discourse.\nThe spirit of RCSU is slipping fast.\nThe political bullshit should be left to\nICU etc. Why can't those who are\ninvolved with RCSU drop their\nmission to change the universe,\nbecause they'll never do it, they just\nneed to relax and enjoy what there is\nto be appreciated, they are missing\nout on an awful lot of fun.\nThere should indeed be room for\nboth camps to be allowed to exist\ntogether. If everyone continues the\nway they are going, both sides will\nbecome so bitterly intrenched, any\nspirit of enjoyment will disappear\nforever, and RCS will have died\u2014\nplease don't do that!\nYours sincerely,\nDavid H Williams\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews FELIX, Friday May 29th19879 Exhibitions Restaurant\nReviews\nThere is a slightly arrogant\nassumption that only Western culture\npost 1500 produced works of art on\na grand scale. Both exhibitions on at\nthe Royal Academy of Arts gainsay\nthis; one is a display of jewellery from\nthe third Millenium BC to the seventh\ncentury AD in the regions that stretch\nfrom Greece to Afghanistan and from\nthe Caucasus Mountains in the USSR\nto Egypt. The second is the well\npublicised exhibition of icons and\nfrescoes from the Greek culture of\nByzantium and Crete, mostly\npre-1450.\nThe jewellery ranges from crude\nflattened discs of gold to beautiful\nwreaths of gold oak or laurel leaves,\ncomplete with acorns and jewelled\nflowers, made for victorious athletes\nor for funerals. There are two\nhundred and fifty necklaces, ea rings, buttons, rings, diadems, neck torques,\nbeads and flowers on display plus a very learned commentary on trade\nroutes, migrations, techniques etc,\nand you can have a good laugh at all\nthe art students saying \"Gosh\u2014how\nfascinating\u2014is it cast or repo use e?\". My favourite bits were two lapis\nlazuli pommel ends or knife handles,\nshaped like snarling tiger heads.\nThe Icons are more interesting than\nthe jewellery, although they range\nover a shorter period and smaller\narea. The exhibition is designed to\nshow how art developed in the eastern\nhalf of the Mcditeiannean, finishing\nwith Ihe painter Kl Greco, who\nbecame a Renaissance artist in Spain\nand Italy. Although the lighting is\ndim, the bright colours and detail of\nthe icons are astonishing. They are\neither small icons for private prayer\nor large ones for processions or the\nwalls of churches. Favourites are\nMadonna's and Jesus's, with some\nlocal saints thrown in, such as St\nGeorge and St Demetius, who were\na kind of holy SAS\u2014killing dragons\nand rescuing slaves; or St Nicholas,\nwho also went around rescuing people\ncondemned to execution and paying\npoor girls' dowries all shown in\npicture stories.\nThe sore points about the Royal\nAcademy are its high charges (\u00a31.70\nfor each exhibition) and the poor\nquality of some of its postcards. There\nare, however, numerous free galleries\naround like the Tate or National, plus\nthe small private galleries.\nI visited Jake Sutton's exhibition at\nthe Francis-Kyle Gallery, 9 Maddox\nSt, expecting it to be a breath of fresh\nair, but whilst appreciating his bright\ncolours and lively scenes his pictures\nwere all a bit same-y. There are about\nforty on show, mostly watercolours\nranging from \u00a3500 to \u00a31500\u2014but the\nentrance is free. The scenes are jolly:\nboating on the river, circuses. Punch\nand Judy shows, a day at the races,\nsteamboats and flowers; the sort of\noptimistic, pretty art that the British\nMiddle Classes can hang on the wall\nwithout getting a guilty conscience.\nPerhaps (hat's why he never paints the\nfaces in\u2014he's hinting at the\nempty noss of all this materialism.\nNevertheless it's very jolly art\u2014the\nwat c rl ill ics arc particularly lovely and\nsome of the close-up sketches of\ntrapeze artists and jockeys were\nexhilarating\u2014but still no faces. He is\nreminiscent of Raoul Duty; colourful\nand a situation briskly filled in with\na few strokes, but with this difference;\nDufy hangs in the Tate and Sutton\ndoesn't.( Yet). Postcards are\navailable.\nByzantine Icons closes 21st June\nJewels closes 28th June\nJake Sutton closes 18th June\nLC2,\nmm\nCi\nThe Chelsea Pot\nIf ever you are stuck with only \u00a32.00\nin your pocket, feeling desperately\nhungry and are too lazy to cook, then\nhead for the Chelsea Pot (Kings\nRoad). One of a chain of 'Pots', this\nrestaurant serves just about the\ncheapest food that rates as food. The\nservice is non-existent and the food\nisn't really much above good\nrefectory standard, but the place has\na distinct charm which is all its own\nand always seems to attract a good\nselection of pseudo-n utters. Favourites include Moussaka (\u00a31.50,\nor thereabouts) and Chicken\nsomething-or-other (who cares?). At\nleast it gets you out for the evening.\nGood for street c red. David Jones\nCheap places to eat in London are\nbecoming few and far between these\ndays. Most students face bills of \u00a35\na head in even the best local\neateries\u2014and that's without the drink.\nOne exception to this is the Won Kei\nin Soho where the average oriental\nblow out comes to about \u00a34 with\nChinese tea included. Many of you\nwill have already visited this popular\nrestaurant for a club dinner or before\nvisiting any one of the numerous\ntheatres on Shaftsbury Avenue. Like\nthe Texas Lone Star it makes its\nmoney by turning over as many\npeople as possible in one night. Be\nprepared for poor service\u2014they won't serve you if you sit down before they\nshow you to a place. It's terribly noisy\nas Chinese instructions are shouted\nbackwards and forwards across the\nrooms. Not a place for a nice intimate\nevening. The food arrives within five\nminutes of ordering and the bill within\none minute of finishing.\nThe menu contains over 70 Chinese\ndishes but most prefer to opt for the\nset meals at \u00a33.80 per person (20p extra for egg fried rice). These\ninclude the favourites: Sweet and\nSour Pork, Chicken with Cashew\nNuts, Beef in Black Bean Sauce and\nMixed Stir Fried Vegetables served\nup with generous portions of rice.\nIf you want to vary this a little then\nyou can choose soup noodles, ho fun\nand crispy noodles (I have to\nrecommend the Barbeque Pork\nNoodle especially).\nBefore visiting the Won Kei, make\nsure that you've got enough cash\nbecause they don't accept anything\nelse (except for doing the washing up\nof course).\nJudith Hackney\n\n"

    "content": "Feature FELIX, Friday May29 th19876 The Ash Interview Imperial College's Mr Big, press baron David Jones, takes time out from a crowded schedule to share a cup of coffee with the Rector, Professor Eric Ash\nFELIX: You've been involved in various\nprojects to raise money for the College.\nOne of these has been to make efforts\nto contact the College alumni. How\nsuccessful do you think this has been so\nfar, and how much revenue do you think\nwill be raised from the project?\nProf Ash: We have not so far attempted\nto raise any money from our alumni.\nThe exercise so far has been to try to\nfind out who they are, where they live,\nand to determine whether they are in any\nsense interested in the College. I might\nsay that one of the people I wrote to\nwrote back, said that he'd read between\nthe lines, and enclosed a cheque for \u00a350,\nwhich we have since framed in the\nAlumnus Office as the first contribution which has reached us. However, in the\nfuture I do very much hope that the\nalun in i will support the College in all\nsorts of ways including financial.\nFELIX: The College is trying to recruit\nmore to more overseas students to help\nimprove the College balance. Do you\nthink there is any possibility that the\nCollege will need to do this at the\nexpense of home students, particularly\nin the light of the tightening\naccommodation situation ?\nProf Ash: There is no danger at all of\nus supplanting home students by foreign\nstudents, indeed one of the things that\nconcerns me is that for several years we\nhave under-recruited home students by\nsomething like 10%, and I regard that\nas one of the most important items on\nour agenda; to improve our performance\nin recruiting really bright home students.\nI believe that we would be able to absorb\na modest additional number of overseas\nstudents. Our target at the moment is to\ngo up to 1300 students\u2014there are just\nover a thousand students at present.\nThe accommodation business is\nextremely serious. At the moment we\nare able to promise first-year students\naccommodation in College-owned\nproperty of one sort or another, and we\nwill be able to stick to that whatever\nhappens. In the past we have been able\nto promise, even now we are still able\nto promise one year in College-owned\naccommodation for first year overseas\nstudents going on to postgraduate\ncourses. That promise is at risk. It really\nall depends on how rapidly we can\nacquire new accommodation. I would\nvery much like to be able to sustain that\npromise, but I'm not absolutely sure that\nwe will be able to do so. Top priority\nmust go to first-year undergraduates.\nFELIX: // the Collegefinallysettles the\ndeal for the houses in Evelyn Gardens,\nis this going to alleviate the problem and\nenable us to meet these guarantees for\nthe immediate future?\nProf Ash: It would be an enormous help\nin that direction. That is one of the most\ncheerful things that have happened in\nrecent times, and I applaud the very\nconstructive reaction we have had from\nICU in enabling us to finance it. There\nis no way we could have done it without\ntheir cooperation.\nFELIX: One thing you have expressed\na commitment to, during your time at IC,\nis improving teaching standards in many\ndepartments. Do you feel there has been\nany perceptible change in the last two\nyears?\nProf Ash: Let me start by saying that\nI do not believe that teaching standards\nat Imperial College were particularly\nlow. On the whole teaching standards\nare high, were high when I came, and\nacademic staff regarded this as a very\nserious commitment. Nonetheless, in\nany organisation where you aim at the\nhighest possible standards in research as\nwell as teaching, there is going to be a certain amount of tension between these\ndifferent types of duty which make up\nthe academic career. I believe that we\nhave been able to put a good deal of\nincreased emphasis on the importance\nof excellence in teaching. In particular\nthe committee under Professor David\nBlow has been examining this from all\npossible angles, and has made a whole\nseries of suggestions, some of which\nhave been implemented, some of which\nwe are about to implement, which I believe will make a very major\ndifference.\nFELIX: Just before Easter it was\nannounced that the Governing Body was\nintending to axe 100 jobs from the\nCollege, throughout all departments\n(including administration). What has\nbeen the response ofthe campus unions\nto this suggestion, and is there any\nindication yet as to whether any jobs will\nhave to go through compulsory\nred un dances? Prof Ash: We are not at this stage\nconsidering compulsory redundancies.\nWe do need to lose something like 100\nposts out of the 2000 that we have in the\nCollege at the moment; we expect that\nthis will be achieved within a year or two\nby people not filling vacancies as they\narise, by people taking early retirement\nand by people resigning to go to other\njobs.\nFELIX: Do you think the tension\nbetween aspects of an academic's life at\nImperial will be increased as the\nGovernment puts more strain on\nuniversities through reduced finding;\nwill this cause IC to concentrate more\non improving itself as a research centre,\nand do you think this situation is likely\nto change depending on the result ofthe\nGeneral Election?\nProf Ash: Well, there is a whole series\nof questions there. Thefirstthing to say\nis that the universities are indeed under\npressure. Imperial College has been put\nunder pressure, perhaps particularly\nbecause we were allowed to enjoy a very\nfavourable student-staff ratio until a couple of years ago. Becuase we no\nlonger have this favourable student staff\nratio, the financial provisions that we\nhave had from the UGC have been less\nfavourable than one would have\nexpected in view of the world-recognised eminence of Imperial\nCollege. I might say that Oxford and\nCambridge have been hit by exactly the\nsame problem. I believe that we are\ngoing to be under continuing pressure;\nmy personal belief is that this will not\nchange very much with whatever new\nadministration we will face in a few\nweeks time. I know that some of my\ncolleagues would disagree with me on\nthat, but that is my reading of the\nsituation. I do have my own favourite,\nI have to admit, but I don't think it's going to make a first order difference.\nI do believe that we will have to re-think\nour role to a considerable extent, and\ncertainly one of the pressures on\nacademic staff which is very evident\nright here and now is that whereas we\ncan still get adequate funding for our\nresearch, it is taking a larger percentage\nof everybody's time and energy to\nsecure that funding. I see that problem\nas a continuing problem and as a partial\nanswer we will have to get more efficient\nin the way in which we produce contract\nproposals and research grant proposals\nand we will have to consider spreading\nour proposals to agencies and industries\nwhich we would not previously have\nconsidered.\nFELIX: You've expressed an interest in\nstudent loan schemes; these have been\nresisted by most student bodies over the\npast few years. How do you feel a loan\nscheme could benefit undergraduate\nstudents, and is there a possibility that\nstudents selecting a course would be\nforced to go for ones which were\nvocational, and, therefore likely to\nenable repayment of a loan as quickly\nas possible?\nProf Ash: The first thing to say is that\nI'm not myself in favour of a loan\nscheme if there is in fact a good\nalternative. The second thing you've got\nto be very clear about is that you don't mix up the Rector with Her Majesty's Government. I think we have to look at\nthe loan scheme as something which is\nimposed by Government, and not really\nsomething going to be given the weight\nwhich I think it deserves. Here, of\ncourse, we are making a judgement as\nto what happens at the election; let's assume for the moment that the same\nadministration continues and that the\ncommittee set up by the Prime Minister,\nunder the chairmanship of George\nBalden, will report their findings on the\nloan scheme; they have not reported so\nfar and it has been clear for some\nconsiderable time that they would not do\nso before an election. I believe that some\n\n"

    "content": "Featura FELIX, Friday May 29th1987 For those of you who found Chris\nEdward's 'Art of Noise' feature\ninteresting, a sequel on samplers\nfollows:\nA sampler uses similar technology\nto a CD player, although samplers\nusually use 12 bit resolution for\nstoring sounds in RAM with floppy\ndisk backup, rather than 16 bit from\nan optical disk, and remember only\na few minutes of sound at best, rather\nthan over an hour for CDs. In the\nsampler, the musician has a machine\ncapable of producing any sound at all,\nwhether a real one that has been\ninput ed and digitised, or a pseudo real one that has been created by setting\nup the 'waveform RAM' manually.\nSo are samplers the end of the line?\nBy far the most eagerly sought\nelectronic clone is for an acoustic\npiano, and yet although we have\nelectronic pianos, classically trained\npianists still use those huge\ntemperamental pieces of fur nti ture that need hours of tuning after each\nremoval to a new concert. Why?\nYou can easily take the sound of an\nacoustic piano and sample it. On a good enough machine, you can play\nback the note you've just sampled and\nnot be able to tell the difference.\nHowever, play a scale, and something\nodd results. The sampler plays other\nnotes simply by playing back the\nwaveform data at different speeds, so\ntwo octaves up, your sound is four\ntimes shorter than the original. Also,\nit sounds nothing like a piano would\nat that pitch. The \"Mickey Mouse\nEffect\" normally restricts single\nsamples \\o a range of an octave at the\nmost. The solution is to use a multi-sample, where you sample the piano\nat several pitches, and cross-fade the\ndifferent recordings as you play up the\nsampler's keyboard. You're starting\nto talk big memory here, especially\nif you sample all 88 notes, as you\nneed to for true fidelity. So you play\n'Moonlight Sonata' and it still sounds\nnothing like a piano. The reason why\nthe piano caught on in the first place,\nand got its name 'pianoforte', was\nbecause of its wide range of dynamic\nexpression. OK, so your sampler has\na 'velocity responsive' keyboard;\nprogramming the thing so that a hard\npressed key = loud, and a soft\ndepression = quiet only slightly\nallie via tes the problem. Actually of\ncourse, pressing the key harder on a piano changes the waveform too.\nSuppose you now sample a piano at\nall 88 notes, and at 256 different key\nvelocities. Your impersonation now\nbegins to take in all but those who\nplay a piano every day, but you've\nused many GIGAbytes of memory,\nand you still haven't taken into\naccount the waveform changes of the\n'loud' and 'soft' pedals, or the inter-string resonances within the casing.\nAs you can see, there's a long long\nway to go before you'll convince\nAshkenazy to \"Go Electronic\"!\nSimilar problems exist with other\ninstrument clones. A snare-drum's waveform alters depending on how\nhard you hit it, where you hit it, and\nwhen you last hit it. A saxophone's waveform varies with air pressure,\nand the lip cheek control of the\nplayer. Even if you could take all this\ninto account, you still couldn't generate that expression from a sampler keyboard, so why not play\na real one? Or better still, use a saxophone to control expression on\nthe sampler, as AKAl's new product\ndoes.\nOne point worth mentioning\u2014how\nBIT PARTS \u2022 Richard Fincher\nsamples the problems\nwith impersonating\npianos.\ndoes today's pop star use samplers?\nOf the alternatives, they can:\n1) Create their own unique sounds.\nGenerally they're either too thick, or\nhaven't time, to do this.\n2) Hire someone else to do it; as\non 'Slave to the Rhythm', which was\nprogrammed by Steve Lipson, Trevor\nHorn's programmer.\n3) Go round with a Walkman,\nrecording real but unusual sounds to\nsample back at home. This can be\nmost effective and original. Depeche\nMode's 'Black Celebration' is a showcase for this technique.\n4) Use libraries; this is what most\npeople do. All the major sampler\nmakers, (E mu, KORG, Ensoniq,\nAKAI, Roland, Sequential) produce\nlibraries of sounds on disks. It's so\neasy. Just boot them up, and you've\ngot the result of someone's days\nslaving over a computer.\nUnfortunately, you've also got a oneway ticket for the express train to\npredictability; you sound like\neveryone else. The success of\nOberheim's DPX-1, which can't create new samples, but plays back\ndisks from other samplers shows what\nmost musicians want.\n5) Nick sounds from records or\nCD's; Illegal of course, but then who\nhasn't broken the copyright act at one\ntime? 'Simon Le Rhodes' hears a great bass sound on the radio, goes\nout and buys the CD, samples it, and\nin 5 minutes, he's using it on his next\ndemo.\nFinally, if you're at all interested\nin sound sampling, go to Tottenham\nCourt Road and ask for a demo of the\nCasio SK-1. It's still amazing what a less-than-\u00a3100 'toy' can do!\nRichard Fincher\n\n"

The\nTreasury is expected to resist the\nproposal and is unlikely to make any\nmore money available for student\nsupport.\nThe National Union of Students\ndescribed the scheme as an\nacknowledgement of the inadequate\nlevel of grants.

    "content": "Sabbaticals FELIX, Friday May29 th19874 I'd rather have a cup of tea\nIt occurs to me that there are only\nabout three issues of FELIX left to go\nbefore the end of the year. Only three\nmore ever-receding deadlines to meet,\nonly three more chances to provoke\na bit of hate-mail (it's been a bit thin\non the ground recently). So here\ngoes...\nLast Thursday as I was crossing\nBeit Quadrangle early in the afternoon\nI happened to witness the \"initiation\nceremony\" of 'Links' the all-male tie\nclub of City and Guilds. Various\npeople were hopping round the quad,\ndrinking pints of beer in one go and\nsometimes bringing them straight\nback up again. As I watched one\nparticular specimen, wearing only a jock-strap, heaving his guts up over\na bush, it occurred to me that although\nI 've seen this sort of thing several\ntimes during my four years at\nImperial, I still fail to understand why\nthis particular group of students feel\nthey have the right to impose such\ndisgusting and anti-social behaviour\non the rest of the College community.\nIf there is anyone who finds this kind\nof thing justifiable perhaps they would\nbe so good as to enlighten me.\nWhilst on the subject of organised\nalcohol abuse; earlier in the year I was\ninvited to the annual dinner of another\nwell-established social club by a very\ndear friend. I went along and enjoyed\nthe company and the food, but found\nthe evening dominated by the\nobsession with alcohol. People stood\non chairs to drink 'penalty pints'\nwhilst the assembled company\ncheered and jeered. The climax of the\nevening came when the president of\nthe club drank three pints of beer\n\"down-in-one\" from the three-handled pot. This feat was regarded\nwith considerable admiration, it was\nalso followed by the inevitable\nconsequences. Needless to say. by the\nend of the night, various bits of the\nUnion Building bore witness to the\nfact that many stomachs could not\ncope with the abuse they had been put\nthrough.\nOf course organised drinking is not\njust a feature of the Links and Diggers\nclubs but is prevalent in many\norganisations throughout College.\nMany of these groups have their\npositive sides, promoting friendship\nand doing worthwhile work, but the\nnegative side can't be ignored.\nI still fail to understand it. Alcohol\nis a drug and a poison. Many people,\nincluding myself, choose to use it and\nUNION BAR\nEND OF TERM\nBASE\nFeaturing:\n-NORMAN & THE NUTBURGERS\u2014STAGE FRIGHT\u2014\n& OTHERS\n(main band to be announced)\nFRIDAY 19th JUNE\nlate bar & cheap drinks\nWATCH THIS SPACE!!\noccasionally may abuse it. It is quite\nprobable that a lot of people at\nImperial are dependent on alcohol\nwithout realising it. (If you drink a few pints regularly, this could include\nyou.) Is institutional ising the regular,\nsystematic abuse of a drug like this\nreally acceptable? Surely if an\nindividual wishes to poison\nthemselves with alcohol that's their\nproblem\u2014until it makes them\noffensive to other people in which\ncase a serious re-think is called for.\nMaking it acceptable\u2014and even\ndesirable\u2014for people to push\nthemselves to the limits of their\ntolerance of the drug, on a regular,\norganised basis, seems irresponsible\nto say the least. Call me a hypocrite\nif you like, but I feel that there's a world of difference between\nindividuals having a drink together\nand a club which includes systematic\nalcohol abuse in its constitution.\nWhen I was eight or nine my\nfriends and I formed a succession of\nclubs with entry conditions and\ninitiation ceremonies of varying\ndegrees of silliness. However for\nsheer mindless stupidity some of the\nthings I have seen here outclass my\nchildish antics by at least a factor of\nten.\nI make no apology for saying things\nwhich have been said before. It's an\nopinion which is highly unpopular in\nsome quarters; but it's one which has\nbeen re-inforced by a year around the\nUnion Building, seeing, again and\nagain, how a palling the effects of\nalcohol can be.\nOn a different note\nWe're still looking for individuals and\nsocieties to help out at the 'Family\nDay' on June 21st.

This will mean that students in Weeks,\nLinstead and Southside Halls will be paying over \u00a335 per week\nfor a single room.\nThe rent increases were approved\nat the last meeting of the Student\nResidence Committee (SRC) on\nWednesday. The new figures h ve been calculated by increasing the\ncurrent rents by 5 %, and then adding\na figure of \u00a33.50 to cover the costs\nof the ten new houses in Evelyn\nGardens. There is likely to be a small\nadjustment to the rents for Weeks,\nLinstead and Southside to make the\ncharge the same for all three Halls.\nThe substantial increases have been\nexpected ever since the acquisition of\nthe new houses in Evelyn Gardens\nlooked likely. Though the new rents\nare a significant increase the College\nis hoping that they will still be good\nvalue for students, in anticipation of\nmoves by a Conservative\nGovernment, if returned, to scrap\nhousing benefits for students in\nprivate accommodation. (Students\nliving in College maintained Halls or\nHouses are already ineligible for\nHousing Benefit).\nSubject to these final adjustments,\nrents in Weeks (presently \u00a331.20),\nSouthside (\u00a330.00), and Linstead\n(\u00a331.00 single not including the\nrefectory service) will all rise by\napproximately \u00a35.00.

In Evelyn\nGardens a single room in one of the\n' upgraded houses will now cost \u00a329.02\nand a double room \u00a321.25. For non-upgraded houses the rents will be\n\u00a327.34 (single), \u00a319.57 (double) and\n\u00a315.68 (triple).

Most members of the\nCommittee, including current Evelyn\nGardens wardens, are keen to see the\nnew accommodation divided into two\n'Houses' and two new wardens\nappointed. The alternative, which\nappears to have the backing of\nCollege administration, is to appoint\nonly one warden, who would be a member of academic staff, and senior\nto the other wardens in Evelyn\nGardens. College Assistant Secretary\nMichael Arthur submitted a paper to\nthe meeting, supposedly outlining\nboth sides of the argument. A version\nof this will go to the Rector's Policy\nCommittee under the signature of\nCollege Secretary John Smith. Most\nmembers of the Committee felt that\nthis paper was biased in favour of the\none warden option and will be\ndrafting a fresh document for the\nRector's Policy Committee, the Body\nwhich will make a final decision,\nthough the Rector is not present\nhimself.\nSpeaking to FELIX yesterday, Mr\nArthur said that the College had to\ntake a \"wider view\" than was\nrepresented at SRC and that it was\nessential to have a senior staff warden\nif he or she were to have overall\ncontrol of 600 residents.\nEarlier in the week Mr Arthur\ncommented \"I 've never heard of a six-pack, I always buy mine in\nthrees!\" He went on to say \"If Ian\nHowgate were David Owen it would\nincrease my chances of voting\nAlliance.\"\nIC orchestra,\nWednesday\nduring their performance of Tchaikovsky's1812 overture on\nPrincess\nAnne\nlaunches\nLIVE-NET\nPrincess Anne officially opened the\nUniversity of London's LIVE-NET\nsystem yesterday.

    "content": "Editorial FELIX, Friday May 29th19873 Rent increases and loans Sending the boys round\nIt has been clear for some time that\nstudents in College residences would\nbe facing substantial rent increases\nnext year, partly as a result of the\nacquisition of the new Evelyn\nGardens Houses. It is difficult to see\nhow any non-sponsored student can\npossibly get by on a London grant less\nrent of \u00a335 for 31 weeks, yet alone\nhigher rents in the private sector. This\nis the sort of situation that can make\na low-interest loan scheme seem\nattractive. Since nearly all students\nare in debt anyway, a formalised loan\nsystem would provide much greater\nfinancial stability during three or four\nyears of undergraduate study.\nEventually, unless the present\nGovernment is removed, students will\nbe dependent upon loans, whether or\nnot the means-tested grant is\nabolished. Personally, I will never\nunderstand why tertiary education,\nlike all other levels, should not be free\nto everyone, or to all those who have\nthe ability to benefit.\nThis year the Print Unit has done\nmore private work for Union clubs\nthan ever before, and, strangely\nenough, we have sent out more\ninvoices than ever before. Our rates\nare such that FELIX gets practically\nno financial benefit from a lot of the\nsmaller jobs, whereas quite a lot of\ntime is absorbed typesetting, pasting-up and finishing.

It was a long and difficult\njourney, but the route there was kept\nopen by the Byzantine Empire and the\nMoslems, who held Jerusalem,\ntolerated the pilgrims. But in the\nsecond half of the century, the Selljuk\nTurks invaded the Byzantine Empire\nand took Jerusalem from the more\ntolerant Moslems who had held it\npreviously. The Turks harassed and\nmaltreated the pil g rms and this,\ncoupled with calls for help from the\nByzantines, gave rise to the crusades.\nThousands of people in Europe\ntook the cross and an expedition was\norganised which in 1099, captured\nJerusalem. Four crusader states were\nthus established in the Holy Land.\nWho went on crusade and why did\nthey do it? Firstly, a great number of\ncommon people took the cross mainly\nout of genuine religious zeal, but there\nwere other factors: Life for common\npeople in Europe at the time was very\ngrim. The vast majority were peasants\nwho were at the mercy of a harvest\nthat regularly failed, and of private\nwars between the barons in which\ntheir crops were burned, their hovels\nraided and their relatives carried off\ninto slavery or simply murdered. The\nother main group who went crusading\nwere the lesser nobility. Though\nreligion also played a part, they went\nto get new lands in the East. They\nwere mainly the younger sons of great\nbarons who were unlikely to succeed\nto any lands in Europe. Indeed, many\nof the crusaders were Normans,\nwhose kin had recently conquered\nEngland for precisely that reason.\nOnce the four crusading states had\nbeen set up, but what later became\nknown as the First Crusade, many of\nthe crusaders felt they had done their\nbit and went home. The states, the\nKingdom of Jerusalem, the\nPrincipality of Antioch and the\ncounties of Tripoli and Edessa, had\nto be defended with a very small\nnumber of men. To do this, the\ncurs a der s built many castles. Since\nthe lack of water and the heat of the\nEast made it difficult to keep armies\nin the field for long, siege warfare\nwas very important and the walled\ncities and castles were thus more\nformidable and bigger than those in\nEurope.\nThe Land Beyond the Sea or\nOutremer, as it was called in medieval\nFrench, was always short of men.\nFew enough had stayed in the Holy\nLand after the first crusade, but the\nshortage was aggravated by the fact\nthat the crusaders knew little about\nsanitation, and while they could get\naway with their habits in Europe, they\ndied of every kind of disease in the\nheat of the East.\nOne of the ways used to combat the\nmanpower shortage was the\nfoundation early on in crusading\nhistory of the military orders. These\nwere religious order of knights sworn\nto poverty, chastity and obedience and\nto defending the holy places.\nEuropean nobles, rather than\nundertaking the difficulty and expense\nof crusading themselves, could salve\ntheir consciences by endowing one of\nthe military orders. They were also\nexcellent ways of getting restless and\ntroublesome younger sons out of the\nway. The military orders soon\nbecame rich, with assets all over\nEurope as well as in Outremer. The\nmain orders were the Templars and\nHospitallers. It is from the Templars\nthat the well known image of the\nknight with a red cross on a white\nsur coat originated. The Hospitallers\nwere a white cross on black.\nSometime after the foundation of the\nTemplars and Hospitallers, German\ncrusaders, who felt that these orders\nwere dominated too much by the\nFrench, founded a third order, the\nTeutonic Knights\nThe history of civilisation goes\nback a lot further in the levant than\nin Europe, and when the crusaders\nfirst arrived, they were regarded as\nuncultured barbarians even by the\nnative christians whom they had\nliberated from Moslem rule.\nMoreover, the native christians who\nhad been living in the Holy Land\nsince the time of Christ followed a slight different creed from the\ncrusaders and this added to the\nfriction.\nThe precarious ness of their\nsituation meant that the crusading\nstates could not last long. In 1187 the\nMoslems under Aaladin recaptured\nJerusalem after the disastrous battle\nof Hattin. This finished the Kingdom\nof Jerusalem after only eighty-eight\nyears. It provoked the Third Crusade,\nwhich though it failed to recover\nJerusalem, prolonged the crusader's existence for another hundred years.\nOver the hundred years, what was left\nof crusaders' lands was gradually\nwhittled away, until in 1291, the last\ncrusader town fell.\nThe crusaders make a wonderful\nstory and have left their mark on\nPalestine in the shape of many\nspectacular ruins. But it must not be\nforgotten that they were essentially a great act of intolerance that did no one\nany long term good.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX, Friday May29 th19877 of the fears you express are real, I believe that the intention of the\nGovernment is to be more di rigi ste than\nany Government has been so far in\nhigher education, that there will\ntherefore be a tendency to increase the\nnumber of students in the sciences and\nengineering. To some extent, as long as\nthis trend doesn't go too far, I think one\ncan see a certain amount of sense in it.\nThe country can make a great deal of\nuse of applied scientists who are\ncompetent, but perhaps not particularly\nbrilliant at their work, whereas the use\nyou can make of people who have gone\nthrough a degree in the arts, and who\nare fairly average, is really very limited.\nUp to a point some of this funnelling of\ntalent in to the sciences is not entirely\na mistake; what worries everyone is the\nextent to which this will be pushed, and\nthe extent to which the universities will\nlose control, and the extent to which the\npeople who want to study will lose\ncontrol over what they are able to do.\nFELIX: Do you feel there is a danger\nalso that, as universities strengthen their\nties with industry, education will have\nto move too far towards what is\ndemanded by big industrial sponsors?\nProf Ash: I think that danger exists, I believe it can be resisted; I believe that\nwe can resist the tendency to go too far\ntowards developmental types of\nresearch. It has always been fairly easy\nfor elite research teams to get money.\nThe trick is to get money to do what you\nwant to do in any case, and I believe that\nwe will be able to do that.\nFELIX: A recent Board of Studies\nmeeting minuted that, due to a shortage\nof space, some departments might need\nto introduce 8.30am lectures. Do you see\nthis as a definite possibility?\nProf Ash: I do see it as a possibility and\nI believe that it will be less unpopular\nthan you might think at first sight. It's hard to get out of bed for a9.30 lecture;\nit is actually no harder to get out of bed\nin time for an 8.30 lecture. It's purely\na matter of putting the alarm clock one\nhour earlier. Moreover if you have to\ncommute, as some of our students do,\nit is actually much\"more comfortable to\ncommute in time for an 8.30 class than\na9.30 class. What I think is needed is\nsomething like the American universities\nprovide, and incidentally an early class\nin America is 7.00am,a medium starting\ntime is 8.00am and a late class is\n9.00am.I believe that the essential\nrequirement is to have a vat of coffee\navailable and I think that that is the\ninitiative that Departments should take\nwhen they schedule lectures for 8.30.\nFELIX: Few IC students know very\nmuch about the Technology Centre\nwhich is being set up at Silwood Park.\nCould you first of all tell us a little bit\nabout that, and is it likely to affect the\nCollege budget?\nProf Ash: Well it is first and foremost\nan attempt to provide an interface\nbetween the research at Imperial College\nand the outside world. It is, amongst\nother things, a place where small\nto return funds to the College as an\nexcess of funds accumulate. I believe\nthat in time it will have a positive impact\non our budget, but quite apart from that\nI also think that it will provide a better\ninterface between ourselves and industry\nand will lead to indirect benefits which\nmay in fact be very much larger than\nthose direct benefits.\ncompanies that people within Imperial\nCollege would like to set up can start\ntheir existence in a kind of sheltered\nenvironment. I believe that, in the\nfullness of time, the College will indeed\nbenefit. This Science Park within\nSilwood Park has been set up by starting\na company called Impel. Impel is not\nmeant to make a profit, but it is meant\nFELIX: After eighteen months in the job of Rector, what do you feel have been\nyour major achievements and do you\nfind the job frustrating in that the\nadministration is cumbersome and it\ntakes a long time to get anything into\npractice.\nProf Ash: Let's start with the second\npart of your question; do I find the job\nfrustrating? I would say about two thirds\nof the time, yes. The problem is not just\nadministration; I do believe that\nuniversities are intensely conservative\nplaces, and there is a reluctance to\nchange both at the strategic and at the\ntactical level. In this respect Imperial\nCollege is no exception. I think my other\nfrustration has been the great difficulty\nof communicating with the academic\nstaff. The students have a good\ncommunications medium in FELIX,\nthere is nothing that corresponds to that\nfor the College as a whole. There was\nsuch a thing; it got axed some years back\nas a result of one of the earlier cuts; I intend to reinstate it; we hope to have\na first issue of a new College journal\nsometime in the fall. As to what I 've\nachieved since I 've been here, I think\nit's very hard to point to anything very\nmuch. I believe that we are well on the\nway to getting a better structure for\ninterfacing with industry, and here the\narrival of Dr David Thomas has made\nan enormous difference.\nI believe that we've made a good start\nat communicating with our alumni; the\nculmination of that first phase will be\nAlumnus Day on 7th July. I believe that\nwe are well on the way to agreeing the\nmerger with St Mary's Hospital Medical\nSchool. I'm very enthusiastic about that\nparticular development. The stage it has\nreached is that we have the enthusiastic\nsupport of the Board of Studies. The\nfinal stage will be to obtain the\nagreement of the Governing Body on\nJune 19th, and I am confident that that\nwill be forthcoming.\nCan I make one further comment?\nFELIX: Certainly.\nProf Ash: I'd like to say something\nabout FELIX. I think FELIX is a very\ngood journal. I think it really does serve\nits primary role of communications\nbetween the students and particularly\nbetween the officers of the Union and\ntheir constituents. I believe that it tends\nto be too inward-looking. There is just\na little too much by way of jokes about\nthe officers and things which really are\nnot likely to be of enormous interest to\nmore than about five percent of the\nstudents. I do think that opportunities for\nlooking at the role of Imperial College\nin the country at large is something that\none could with advantage develop.\nThere's one specific thing which I would\nreally wish to urge on the Editor of\nFELIX, this year's and next year's, and\nthat is never again to accept anno ny mou s letters. I think they are diabolical, even\nif the name is supplied to the Editor.\nThis is a free society; I really do not\naccept that any student needs to have any\nfear of the consequences of writing what\nhe or she firmly believes to FELIX. I believe that they should do so over their\nown signatures.\n\n"
