Kings took the\nlead after five minutes but the Fourths soon\nlevelled the score when a BURNS header was\ndeflected into the net midway through the\nfirst half. Kings again took the lead with a shot just inside the post. Towards the end of\nthe half Oolan scored from the edge of the\nbox to level the score.\nAfter an 'uplifting' half-time chat from\nBuckley the Fourths looked more determined\nas they paced up to the second half. After a good pass from Archer to McNicholas and\nthen an accurate cross BURNS put IC into the\nlead for the first time. Almost immediately the\nFourths scored again when BURNS scored\nfrom outside the box. A competent performance by fullbacks Maddy and Milner and\ngoalkeeper Gilbert ensured Kings had little\nopportunity to get back into the match.\nBURNS headed in his fourth of the match\nafter a good cross from Buckley. Two more\ngoals followed quickly when first Lay and\nthen Hawa successfully beat the opposing\ngoalkeeper after good attacking moves.\nTEAM: Gilber, Mady, Lay, Hatton, Milner,\nArcher, Buckley, Dolin, Nicholas, Burns\nHawa.\nSnooker\nTHE C team didn't play last week and it looks\nas if they have lost their position on top of the\nleague. The other two teams, both won 4-1\nand so are now competing for the number\none position.\nThe B team played Charing Cross Hospital\nwho even struggled trying to find a team.\nThey managed to find five players, some of\nwhich were bar staff and night watchmen t. Anyone I suppose you are all wondering how\n\u2022 (Last Chance) Kelly managed against\nCharing Cross. Well, I am please d to\nannounce, he won and so retains his position\nin the team. Some people have suggested a cover-up by his fellow team mates and that he\nactually lost. Well if this is true the person\ninvolved in such a folly will feel my wrath, fist,\nboot etc. . . . . .\nThe boring, dull, A team won again and are\nbrilliant, great . . . .\nCross Country\nTHE penultimate league race was held at\nGuildford last week. This course is the\nlongest and muddiest that we normally\nencounter, but the overnight rain made\nconditions atrocious.\nThe Imperial team split into two groups:\none travelling by train, the rest waiting for the\nQE C minibus. The latter group never arrived\nat Guildford and our arch-rivals from UC\nromped away to win the race. Pickard and\nKelly headed the IC contingent in ninth and\nthirteenth positions, with Thwaites, Virk,\nWeston, Hayward and Frost all arriving in\nabout four tie th to sixtieth positions, without\nany losses claimed by the mud or sabotage.\nCommiserations must go to our stars left in\nLondon and congratulations to Virk and Frost\nwho produced improved performances.\nTen-Pin\nIN their last home match of the session the\nBowling Club at long last gained victory. A very strong A team turned out against the\nSouthampton opposition and convincingly\nwon 4-0, in the process bowling one of the\ntop games and series in the country this year.\nThe performance wq as assisted by a204 game from Cook, a539 series by MacGowan\nand a513 series by McMullan. The B team\nalso managed to win 4-0 with a good all-round performance bowling 270 pins more\nthan the opposition, who bowled worse than\ntheir own C team. Our C team in fact lost 3-1,\nbut they were a team member short, and the\ngame they did win was by only two pins. The\nhero of the moment was Bob Thong who\nremained calm under pressure and ended up\nwith a440 series. The ladies team was also a member short and, as ever, lost 4-0 but\nshould be thanked for turning up as every pin\nbowled counts.\nResults and Reports for\nSaturday, January 24,1981\nRugby\nIC 1st XV VU C1210 IC 2nd XV VU C028 Football\nIC 6th XI V UCHI I42 Hockey I C1st XI V Ashford 2-2\nIC2 nd XIV Ashford 0-3\nIC3 rd XI V Ashford 5-3\nBasketball\nIC 1stV V Ealing 51-21\nHockey Thirds\nTHE farce started when nine IC players were\ngiven lifts to something that was referred to,\njokingly, as the pitch, and two IC players\nweren't.( Not that pitch again? - Ed.)\nEventually we got eleven players and\nstarted the game. Well, we never really\nstarted, but the umpires began to blow their\nwhistles and several opponents proceeded to\nhit us.\nAfter five minutes of random mediocrity\nPete Hughes had scored twice to give IC a comfortable lead. We then prepared for a long session of mud-slinging. But, Cathy\nCrossley, a guest transvestite, had different\nideas. She scored. Not that surprising, but it\nwas enough to totally confuse IC, who, by\nway of apology, let the opposition score.\n3-1 at half-time.\nThe second half was diabolical, Pete\nHughes was again forced to score twice, and\nfor added amusement our defence ensured'\nthat the opposition scored twice as well.\nNote: Would whoever dug up eight pounds\nof potatoes from the 'pitch' please return\nthem.\nWater Polo\nTHIS WEEKEND, the 'polo team made their\nannual trip to Bristol to play their university\nteam.\nThe match started with the IC team looking\nsuitably sharp and in control, and the first\nquarter passed without a goal. Bristol then\ntook advantage of their huge pool and scored\nthree times. Due to good play by our team, a tightening-up of marking and goals by\nRichard, Mike and Nick, play improved. The\nfinal result, 4-4, was an honourable draw,\nafter which both teams retired to the bar.\nThe Bristolians proved to be very hospitable and great fun was had by all!\nSailing\nTHE IC team finally found form on Saturday\nat 'The Harp' when sailing against St Thomas'\nHospital and University of Kent. The 'A' team\nfinally 'got it all together' with a123 victory\nover Thomas'. In near perfect conditions\nsome of the finer points of team sailing were\nused by IC and the second race was won\nconvincingly.\nKent became fodder for this IC team in fine\nform \u2014 IC winning in two races.\nA fine day's sailing was had and some well\nearned points.\nTEAM: Chadwick, Kennedy, Mills, Murray,\nRedman, Younghusband.\nCanoe\nWhite Water Championships\nTHE Universities White Water Racing Championships were held on January 24 and\n25 at Llangollen on the River Dee. Several IC\npaddlers were among the UL team. Redding\nput in a good time in the individual K1 event\nbut was unable to beat the very fast time put\nin by the winning paddlers. Benter was the\nfastest paddler down the course in a slalom\ncanoe, beating a lot of people in racers. Neil\nMacMillan put in a good time for his first ever\nrace.\nIn the Canadian event we had more\nsuccess. Crofts finished fifth in the C1 event,\nwhich was won by the European Champion,\nMartin Hedges from Bath. In the C2 event\nCrofts and Graham made a good start had\nafter an unfortunate incident with a rock\ncapsized and lost a lot of time. After a quick\nrecovery they still managed to finish fourth.\nTaking advantage of their team mates\nmisfortune Redding paddling with Williams\nfrom Kings moved up to take third place.\nThese results reflect the growing interest and\nsuccess with Canadian canoes within the\nclub, the previous weekend Crofts and\nGraham had won the non-ranking C2 event\non the River Usk.\nWe must thank Tim Clark for spending\nmost of the weekend ferrying canoes and\ncompetitors and also the other reserves\n(Jones, Kilgow, and Redding) who provided\nvaluable support.\nNow for some club news, a new indoor\nslalom league will shortly be starting, so\ncome down to the pool and get promoted. We\nhave trips coming up on February 7/8, surfing\non the Gower, February 21/22, a river trip to\nWales and on March 20/24 a surfing tour to\nCornwell.\nThe big event this summer will be a surfing\ntour to either Portugal or the Biarrik area of\nFrance, anyone interested please let a committee member know.\nPage 10 FEUX, January 30, 1981\n\n"

    "content": "Dear Sir\nMay I just say that I am now\nin my fifth year at IC and during\nthat time I ate cooked Mooneys\nfor only the first six months( Linstead meals excepted, but\nthere I had little choice). After\nthat time, I decided enough was\nenough, and turned to items\nwhich needed no, or minimum, preparation: yoghurt, milk, sandwiches, crisps, and Mars bars. I then cooked my own,\nmore balanced meal in the\nevening.\nIn 1979, I started my PhD as a PRI student at the British Museum( Natural History), attached to IC, and have never\neaten in College since.

It did not\ntake me long to discover that by\nremoving the wall panel just\nabove the fridge I could connect\nan extension to my own room. In\nthe middle of last term, therefore,\nI returned home to bring up my\nown handset and extension lead.\nThen, after a hasty bit of rewiring one night, I was able to\nlink my room to the rest of\nSouthside.\nCovering up my actions so far\nhas been easy. The main risk of\ndiscovery came from the cleaners,\nso I hid the phone in the\nwardrobe, and silenced the bell\nso as not to give the game away.\nThe system worked very well, but\nwas a bit limited, not being able\nto dial outside Southside.\nImagine my delight when I read that the whole internal system was to be put at my disposal.

    "content": "Compiled by Phil Webb\nWednesday, January 14, 1981\nRugby\nGutteridge Cup IC 1st XV V London Hosp 0-6\nGuilds V Roehampton Inst 0-6\nFootball\nIC 2nd XI V Bedford 3-2\nIC 4th XI V Guys 2-1\nHockey IC 1st XI V Goldsmiths 7-0\nGuilds VW HMS41 RCS V Kings Coll 0-3\nWater Polo\nIC V Neptune 13-3\nGutteridge Cup\nTHIS was a replay of the 15-15 draw at\nLondon Hospital last term. The opposition\nturned up half an hour late, and were greeted\nin the first five minutes of the game with a late\nChristmas present. From then on IC fought\nback and the game developed into a kicking\nmatch down the touch line. The Harlington\npitch was i successfully ruined by continual\nforward movements which dominated the\nlatter part of the game.\nThankyou to all the supporters who watched, and rendered verbal abuse to the\nopposition. The referee came back to the\nUnion Bar and managed to crawl out about\n10:30pm. TEAM: Pullin, Parkinson, Huglus Narborough, Morgan, Davies, Chandler, Johns,\nManzoni, Lorans, Richards, Warby, Smart\n(Capt), Hall, Davies, Johnston.\nFootball Seconds\nA spirited second half performance allowed\nthe seconds to come from behind and win a match that they should have had sewn up by\nhalf-time.\nIn the first half Bedford rarely encroached\ninto IC's half of the pitch, such was the\nstrength of the wind. IC, however, were\nunable to convert the territorial superiority\ninto goals. At the interval with a score of 0-0,\nBedford were feeling justifiably pleased, and\nthings looked even bleaker for IC when Bedford went 1-0 up, five minutes into the\nsecond half. IC fought back and were soon on\nlevel terms when Esberger prodded the ball\nhome after a fine run. A close range shot from\nVeen man gave IC the lead, which was\npromptly wiped out by Bedford's second\ngoal. The winner came ten minutes from time\nwhen Saunder's accurate cross was met by a powerful header from Carr which tore into the\nnet. For the remainder of the match, the IC\ndefence, in which Griffiths was outstanding,\nheld out for another two precious league\npoints.\nTEAM: years, Curran, Beer, Armstrong,\nLakin, Griffiths, Esberger, Wiggins, Veenman,\nSaunders, Carr.\nTim Beer\nFootball Fourths\nTHE visitors arrived late to find the Fourths\nwithout a referee, again! After the Fifths\nsubstitute agreed to officiate, Guys kicked\noff. With a very strong cross wind and greasy\nsurface there was little constructive football\nplayed by either side.\nIC appeared comfortable but Guys equalise d towards the end of the half, when\na weak goal kick allowed an opposing forward\na free short from the edge of the box.\nAfter half-time IC continued to go forward\nin search of the lead, Guys had the\noccasional break but Hugh Ch own impressed\nin defence for the Fourths.\nIC regained the lead twenty minutes into\nthe half when Hawa produced a good turn\nand cross which fell kindly for BURNS who\nscored from six yards. This goal settled the\nmatch and gave the Fourths revenge for their\nonly league defeat of the season.\nTEAM: Gilbert, Maddy, Lay, Chown, Milner,\nBURNS, Buckley, Graves, McNicholas,\nDolan, BURNS, Hawa.\nRCS Hockey\nLAST WEDNESDAY, RCS Hockey put in a heartening performance that made a mockery\nof claims that the team is dead. In a potentially\ndifficult match away to Kings Coll, who are\nhaving a successful season, RCS dominated\nthe first half-hour of the match and were very\nunlucky not to score on numerous occasions.\nLooking solid if unspectacular in defence,\nRCS attacked confidently with latest recruit\nharding and 'old hand' Farrington looking\nsharp. However, as frustration grew, the\nmatch deteriorated and play became scrappy.\nIn the second half, Kings confidence increased and while RCS were still making\nscoring opportunities, it was Kings who scored three goals in their best patch in the\nmiddle of the second half. Mention must be\nmade of Steve Leinster's magnificent hook\nshot saving a certain goal and of the mystery\nappearance of a 'damaged' kidney in one of\nthe Kings defenders.\nAltogether, this was a highly encouraging\nperformance and one which promises victory\nfor RCS in 1981.\nTEAM: Williams, Rogers, Bird, Leinster,\nSharpe, Pound, Baxter, Taylor, Farrington,\nHarding, Purdy, Morgan.\nSaturday, January 17, 1981\nFootball\nIC 4th XI v Kings (Burns 2) 2-4\nHockey IC 1st XI v Gerrards Cross 2-0\nLawn Tennis\nTRIALS will be held on Thursday, January 29\nand Thursday, February5. Anyone who\nwishes to be considered for this year's mens\nteam must attend both sessions. A team of\neight will be picked, and team training will\ncommence on the Thursday after. The trials\nwill be held at the Linstead Courts and will\nstart at 12:45pm sharp.\nAlso, will all those involved in the Round\nRobin Competition please hurry up and get\ntheir matches played.\nTony Tsoukkas\nCaptain\nSnooker\nAFTER an absence of a few weeks your\nsnooker correspond ant is back and on the\npages of FELIX( hopefully). A lot of\nmovement has occured at the top of the UL\nLeague. It appears as if our C team leads,\nfollowed by the A team, and then the B team.\nSo IC are doing extremely well, especially the\nB team who are now fighting back and look\nlike snatching the title.\nThe A team (a spent force) were the only IC\nteam to lose last week. The brilliant B team\nwere bouy ant after beating LSE by four\nframes to one. Kelly lost our only frame and\nhis position in the team is being scrutinized\nby Proudlove\nThe C team won five-nil against Bedford\nCollege. This has put them on top of the\nleague, however they meet the on-form B team in a few weeks.\nTen-Pin Bowling\nON Saturday (17th) the Bowling Club played\ntheir home match against Portsmouth Polytechnic, who had won the away tie 10-0.\nThe result of this latest meeting was again a defeat but by 8-2, with the A team winning the.\ntwo points. Their 4-0 victory rarely seemed in\ndoubt with good performances by Ng, Lau\nand Cook, playing his first A team game. The\nB team also looked set for victory after\nwinning their first game, but this was due to\nbad bowling by the Portsmouth side. This\nquickly improved and the end result was a31 defect, despite Harrison showing the form\nwhich could have seen him in the A team, an\noffer he declined. Quinn bowled very well for\nthe C team, which included Ann Sudell, an\noverspill from the ladies, but could not\nprevent a40 defeat. The ladies also suffered\nthis fate, despite good individual performances. Future events included a home match this\nSaturday (24th) against Southampton and the\nBrunei Doubles Tournament on the 31st. The\nsingles competition should have started last\nWednesday, but late entries will be accepted\nnext Wednesday (28th), everybody welcome.\nJ Knight\nCaptain\nRunning\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE annually sends a team\nto the illustrious Batavierenrace in Holland.\nThe race is a relay with 25 stages between 2\nand5 miles long, each runner being accompanied by a team-mate on a bicycle.\nLast year, we finished in a surprise second\nplace out of 150 teams.\nAs you can imagine, this is no ordinary\nrace. It starts at midnight as the first group of\nrunners, joggers and struggling Swedes sets\noff, and ends in the afternoon in the expansive grounds of Einschede University.\nIts students host a massive party in the\nevening, providing food and a wide variety of\nmusic in the setting of their cavernous union\nbuilding.\nThis year, the dates are April 23-26 and the\ncost should be well under \u00a340 with a grant.\nWe still need several more people to make up\nthe team, including three ladies and hopefully\nan extra minibus driver. Anyone who is\nvaguely interested should contact Mark Thwaites, Mech Eng 3.\nTrampolining\nFOR THOSE of you who like bouncing up\nand down \u2014 IC Trampo Club has got off the\nground at last. We now meet every Wednesday at 5:00pm in the Courtauld Hall, Queen\nElizabeth's College, Campden Hill Road (Just\noff Kensington High Street).\nWarning: Do not ask the old lady in the\nfoyer of QE C for directions, or she will turn\nyou away ( QE C people are always complaining about her). Just walk in, turn right\nand go up to the first floor.\nACC\nGrant Estimates - January 31\nEven with an excellent turnout of over thirty\npersons at the last ACC Meeting some notable clubs were un-represented. Would all\nclubs please send in their grant estimates to,\nor contact, Nick Morton before January 31,\n1981.\nLast season's Cricket Club colours were\nalso awarded:\nFull: N Price, M Ellacott, P Slator.\nHalf: A Harris, I Crowe, D Salter, J White, G Simpkin, D Everett.\nFELIX, January 23,1981 Page 7\n\n"

    "content": "Postgraduate Questionnaire\nAt present (Monday) I have received 83\nreplies to the questionnaire sent out. Many of\nwhich complain about the role of supervisors.\nThe issue will be discussed at Graduate Studies\non February 3, so it is necessary that replies\nreach me before then. All registered research\nstudents have been sent a questionnaire but it is\nimpossible to contact writing-up students or\nresearch assistants who are also doing PhDs. So\nif researchers could fill in questionnaires and\nencourage others to do so I would be much\nappreciative.\nRefectories\nYes folks I do honestly believe that since I arrived\nat College, Refectory food has improved, one of\nthe main features being the introduction of cook-freeze food. I was elected on a policy of\ncooperation with College authorities to try and\nimprove things in that matter. This I have tried\nand will continue to try until aUG M instructs me\nto change. I feel that such actions as refectory\nboycotts should only be taken as a final course.\nThe one which happened two years ago was\ntaken really as a final action because the\nRefectory Committee would not listen to the\nUnion's arguments on price increases.\nA refectory boycott would cost the Refectories\n\u00a31000 per day, which in order to express the\nstudent feeling can be done through the Union\nrepresentatives.\nIt is really a matter of accepting that food prices\nincrease as do wages and these are subject to\nexternal factors. There are only certain bills\nwhich can be covered by College under UGC regulations and as College is running \u00a3750,000\ndeficit budget this year due to lack of money from\nGovernment, these will be kept to a minimum.\nPrices went up 772 % at the start of the year to\ncover projected wages costs and as food prices\nhave only now made a sign fi cant increase have\nprices gone up again (only by 1%). In fact the\nFinancial Times Food Index went down in\nSeptember and there was a possibility of the\nprices going down.\nI do not consider the quality of the food to be\nHiltonesque but it has improved (e.g. try living in\nInternational Hall). Mr Mooney is willing to hear\ncomplaints of a general and specific nature\nparticularly through Suggestions and Complaints\nCommittee but as he says if you have a specific\ncomplaint it is best to bring the dish back at once.\nI myself would like to see a complete reorganisation of the service as there is too much\nduplication at present i.e. too many outlets\nproviding the same type of food. However, things\nwill not change overnight and since the last\nrefectory boycott there has been a steady\nimprovement.\nPerhaps like the Holland Club we should try to\ntake over the Union completely i.e. the bar and\nLower Refectory. A feasibility study was done by\nseveral outside catering firms several years ago\non this very idea and they all said they would not\ntouch it with a barge-pole. Remember it is open 30\nodd weeks of the year for only 4-5 hours per day.\nSuggestions please? (PS I know yours, Steve.)\nNUS\nI have received a letter from Birmingham University Union about NUS asking for\ninformation, ideas, etc from myself to which I have replied.\nTheir president suggests the formation of a National Union of University Students for 'the\nsole purpose of National negotiations on major\nstudent issues like grants, Hall fees, etc' thus\nreducing the present bureaucracy, size and\nunrepresentative nature on NUS. I am interested\nto hear your opinions.\nICCAG\nBLOOD DONORS. In case you missed their last\nvisit, or chickened out, the Blood Transfusion\nService is returning to college on Tuesday, 10th and Wednesday, 11th February. Your blood is\nbadly needed to save lives in all sorts of situations\nfrom car crashes to childbirth, so please go to the\nUnion Dining Hall, 1st floor of the Union building,\nbetween 9.30 and 12, or 2 and 4 on those days. H you want to know more, see the display in the\nJCR. Giving blood doesn't hurt, but it does save\nlives.\nHOME INSULATION. The cold is a terrible threat\nto old people. If you would like to help by insulating\ntheir homes one afternoon soon (probably Wed\n11th Feb) contact Sean Coyle Elec Eng 2.\nMatters\nRaised\nPersonal Alarms\nHouse Committee has now purchased some\nsmall personal 'shrill' alarms, for the use of any\nwoman using the ladies changing rooms alone.\nThey will be available from Beit Security in\nexchange for your Unioncard, or if anyone would\nlike to buy one, they cost \u00a34.50 from my office.\nHowever I would like to stress that they are not\na joke or a toy, they are designed to t epe B an\nattacker by causing pain in the ears and head, and\ncould do serious permanent damage if misused,\nso please don't play with them, they are for use in\ngenuine cases of emergency only.\nUnion Building\nBy the time you read this all the rooms in the\nBuilding should have a complete set of matching\nchairs, so please don't move chairs from room to\nroom unless absolutely necessary, in which case\nput them back afterwards please.\nThe Senior Common Room is back in use now\nafter being painted and when the curtains and\nlight fittings are finished it should look very smart,\nso can users please take care and let's keep it that\nway.\nAnd finally: Elections are drawing ever nearer,\nso if you fancy doing this job come and see me\nand I 'll tell you all about it.\nCheers.\nRae\nTravelling\nAbroad\nIf student life is settling down into a rather dull\nroutine why not step into a new r6Ie for a few\nweeks in the summer. Become a cowhand in\nUruguay, a barman in Brazil, a community\nworker in Aberdeen, or even a sailing instructor\non the Ivory Coast. These and a vast selection of\nother placements can be bound in Working\nHolidays, 1981 edition, published by the Central\nBureau for Education visits and exchanges, 44\nBaker Street, W l, price \u00a32.30. In comparison with\nother books in this field it certainly sem s to live up\nto its claim to be the most authoritative and\ncomprehensive guide.\nNow is the time to apply for many of the\nplacements listed, so if you're interested we have\na copy in the office (15 Princes Gardens) which\ncan be flipped through for a glimpse of life in far\naway places. It's the sort of book which is useful\nto own however since it also contains a lot of\ninformation concerning the possible hazards of\nliving and working abroad, together with details of\nstudent fares and insurance cover. Since the cost\nof any kind of medical treatment abroad can be\nquite a shock to those of us reared under the\nNHS it is important to make sure you are\nadequately insured.

If the meeting had went\nahead on the original date, it\nwould have meant that the\nchanges would have had to be\nreintroduced on February 19,\nand would then not take effect\nuntil the beginning of the next\nsession. It also seemed unlikely\nthat there would be qu or at eUG Ms next term, so the bylaw\nchanges would drag on into the\nnext session or fail to be accepted\nunless the meeting was brought\nforward.\nThe three proposed changes\ninvolved enabling more College\nmembers to become Union members, removing the Permanent Working Party from the\nUnion Council, and deleting the\nI CW A constitution from the\nBylaws.\nThe controversy over I CW A has been going on for some time.\nAt present, the problem is that\nfor I CW A to alter its own constitution it needs a turnout of\n100 members (from the women at\nIC) to have a quo rate meeting;\nbut I CW A has not had such a meeting for a long period. Hence,\nit is unable to alter itself whilst its\nconstitution is contained in the\nbylaws. It was therefore suggested that the Union should\nremove I CW A from the bylaws\nand leave the way open for a new\nwomen's group, which might cater more fully for the female\nIC Radio\nJammed!\nDave Fuller, IC Radio's Station\nManager, was rushed to Brompton Hospital last week with suspected\nfood poisoning.\nBut hospital staff agreed that\nthe rash and other symptoms\nindicated an allergy, quite possibly to the artificial colouring\nin strawberry jam.

Furthermore,\nBylaw 19 continues by stating\n\" All alterations to the Bylaws\nmust have the approval of the\nGoverning Body before be coming effective\". As this Body\ndoes not meet again until the end\nof this term these alterations cannot take effect until next\nterm. This rearrangement of\ndays has already caused some\ndifficulty. One of the motions\nlikely to be submitted concerns\nBritain's nuclear policy. Owen Greene (a leading member of the\nCollege'sCN D Group) is likely to\nspeak in a debate on such a motion, was perturbed when he\nrealised that the new date clashed with a proposed lecture\non nuclear disarmament, and he\nthought it would be very difficult\nfor those interested to attend the\nlecture, AND vote against multilateral nuclear disarmament at the U GM.

Speaking to\nFELIX about the situation, he\nsaid he had meant his hair *.o be\nin Guilds colours, but it had come\nout pink instead. He1> id that\nalthough many boys regarded\npink as repulsive, it found favour\nwith the girls. He added that he\nwanted to object about the way\nhe was treated in the 'Goat in\nBoots' public house in Fulham Road, where he was refused\nservice, and then thrown out,\nbecause he was thought to be a punk. He stated that he had no\nregrets about his actions so far,\nbut declined to comment on what other Exec members should\nhave cut off for Rag.

    "content": "Forty-two\nOn Monday night, the Beit telly lounge was\ncrowded as usual for the weekly dose of the\nHitchhiker's Guide. A few of the seats were\noccupied by non-Beit residents much to the\nannoyance of one Beit resident who singled\nout one of the non-residents and demanded\nthat he vacate the chair. While I don't agree\nwith his bully-boy tactics he has a point which I must concede is difficult to make in any other\nway.\nBut on the other hand, there has been no\nUnion telly lounge for some time so it is only to\nbe expected that the Beit Lounge should be\nused as such. Let's save all this hassle and\nrefurnish the Union telly lounge with a telly.\nAfter all, every week we hear how many more\nthousands of pounds Rae Snee has had to count from the Lower Lounge gaming machines.\nWhile I realise that the last telly was\nvandalised, I'm sure that members of Union\nCouncil will be only too willing to perform\n\" telly duty\" now that Mr Passmore has\nwithdrawn bar duty.\nI don't know if any of you know this, but\nthere has been much controversy recently\nover adverse criticism of College catering. So\nto prevent Victor M and his team from becoming excessively paranoid, this week's puzzle is to offer them encouragement and\npublicity.\nIn the addition sum below, each different\nletter represents a different digit; and any given\nletter, whenever it occurs, always represents\nthe same digit. Punctuation should be ignored.\nLO! MOONEY MEAT ROLLS, REALLY A TREAT MM!M M!!EAT AT MOONEY S UGM Quandary\nLast week, FELIX informed Liz Lindsay that\nthe bylaw changes discussed at the last U GM of last term could not be read as too much\ntime would have elapsed.\nSo the U GM was brought forward to\nFebruary 5. Now, due to a number of things\nsuch as FELIX not being able to publicise this\nlast week, the lack of any Union publicity, the\nmotions deadline having passed and the C ND lecture (which would have provided most of\nthe audience if last term'sU GM is anything to\ngo by) it seems likely that this next U GM will\nbe in quo rate. And those bylaw changes will\nSTILL not have their second reading. One of\nthese is the motion to delete I CW A from the\nbylaws; a debate which has dragged on for far\ntoo long. I CW A is simply clutching at straws\nfor its survival \u2014 it could have survived by an\ninvalid second reading, and it will now\nprobably survive due to an in qu or at eUG M.IC WA, as it stands at present, is not\nachieving anything as it cannot muster a quo rate meeting, so survival in its present form\nis a pointless existence.\nThe only REAL solution is to get rid of it and\nform a more realistic women's group, if,\nindeed, such a group is desired at all.\nIncidentally, I don't see WIST as any kind of\nanswer either \u2014 they are simply a bunch of\nfemale fanatics.\nOld Preversions\nJohn Passmore may well think that the\nstandard of the food has improved since he\ncame here, but how can he say that one of the\nmain features of this improvement is the\nintroduction of the cook-freeze system? I would say that this has only served to make\nmatters worse. Mr Mooney's largely incompetent staff just can't handle it \u2014 resulting in\nthe kind of cook-freeze abuse we reported last\nterm with mouldy food.\nEven Mr Mooney admits (see FELIX569) that the cook-freeze system has been \" a limited success . . . . it has not been used to its\nfull potential\" and that he has bad staff.\nStop Press\nThe Blood Doning session detailed in the\nICCA G article in this FELIX has just been\ncancelled.\nThanks to\nPatrick, Steve, Dave, Shanne, Mark, Colin,\nPhil, Scaramouche, Ian and Maz.\nFor the sake of pedants I suppose I should\nalso indicate that the numbers are integers in\nbase 10, and the letter O does not necessarily\nrepresent 0.\nYour task is to reconstruct the sum.\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me c/o FELIX by 1:00pm on Wednesday.

    "content": "A programme for survival SHIRLEY WILLIAMS gave a talk, on the Brandt Report, at Imperial\nCollege on Thursday January 15th. Mrs Williams asked FELIX to\nstimulate Interest and to Increase student awareness of the contents\nof the Report. The following article Is based on her lecture, the\nReport ('North-South: a programme for survival') and a personal\nInterview.\nThe Report takes its title from the belief that major international\ninitiatives are needed if mankind is going to survive. For the hundreds of\nmillions of people who live on the edge of starvation in the developing\ncountries, the South, this is a matter of obvious fact. The industrialised\ncountries, the North, have not been willing in the past to go very far towards\naccepting the South's case that the world economy works to the South's disadvantage. The Report argues today, in almost every field of the world's present troubles, a substantial number of the solutions depend on\nrecognising the mutual interests between North and South.\nMrs Williams began by\ncommenting on the present staggering\ngrowth of world population. Over one\nmillion people are added to the\npopulation of the world every five\ndays. By the year 2000 world\npopulation is likely to have increased\nfrom its present level of 4.3 billion to\napproximately 6.3 billion. 90% of the\nincrease will take place in the Third\nWorld. The rapid rise in population\ncompounds the task of providing food,\njobs, shelter, education and health\nservices, of mitigating absolute\npoverty, and of meeting the colossal\nfinancial and administrative needs of\nrapid urbanisation.\nEstimates of how many people in\nthe Third World live in conditions of\nabsolute poverty have been put at\napproximately 800 million. The\ncombination of malnutrition, illiteracy, disease, high birth rates,\nunder employment closes off the\navenues of escape; and while other\ngroups are increasingly vocal, the\npoor and illiterate are usually and\nconveniently silent. The Brandt Shirley Williams\nReport states that priority must be\ngiven to the needs of the poorest\ncountries and regions. The removal of\npoverty requires both substantial\nresource transfers from the developed\ncountries and an increased\ndetermination of the developing\ncountries to improve economic\nmanagement and deal with social and\neconomic inequalities.\nThe Commission believed that the\nworld cannot wait for the longer term\nmeasures before embarking on an\nimmediate action programme for the\nnext five years to avert the most\nserious dangers. An Emergency\nProgramme was proposed having the\nfollowing principal elements:\n1. A large-scale transfer of resources\nto developing countries.\n2. An international energy strategy\nwith the aims of ensuring\nregular supplies of oil, rigorous\nconservation, more predictable and gradual price\nincreases in real terms and the\ndevelopment of alternative\nand renewable energy sources.\n3. A global food programme.\n4. A start on some major reforms in\nthe international monetary\nand financial system, in which\nall parties can participate\nmore fully and an acceleration\nof efforts to improve developing countries' conditions of trade in commodities and manufactures. Mrs Williams said that she was\npleased to choose Imperial to say that\na fresh approach to higher education\nis required. \"We must recognise that\nLetters\nto the\nDear Sir\nI feel obliged to write in defence of you, the Editor. I and numerous others find your\" editorial style\" enlightening and greatly amusing. A bit of\nfun at Mr Mooney's expense is far\nmore entertaining than reports of\nboring drivel that flows from the\ninnumerable committees that all seem to consist of the same people.\nYour remarks about Mr Mooney area lot closer to \"representing the views of the\nstudent body\" than the garbage\nusually churned out by the aforementioned committee, maybe they do not eat Mr Mooney' s products or alter natively consume from his royal\nbin.\nI note that the bulk of the\ncriticism comes from those directly responsible for the appalling shit we are expected to\nshovel into our gullets. Namely,\nthe Rector, the Chairman of the\nRefectory Committee, and the\nDPI CU. Possibly they take the\narticle as a group com de nation of\ntheir catering arrangements, if\nnot, they should.\nMiss R Snee also seems to be\nyour main liter y bugbear, first as\nRag Chairman( ref1979/80 Rag Mag which, incidentally, I thought was a masterpiece) and now as DP she appears to attain\nwith FELIX a position akin to\nthat of Sir James Goldsmith with\nPrivate Eye. Perhaps Exec News\nshould be renamed 'Talbot'.\nAs with regard to other individuals, you have certainly\n'crusaded' against the pompous\negotistical arse holes who see any\nUnion position, however minor,\nas a pedestal to flaunt their own power and glory. Anyone who\nhas tried to gain access to a J CR Party will know exactly what I mean.\nTours in total support\nA Patterson\nMe chEng3 Dear Sir\nLast week a letter addressed to\nsecretary of the Conservative Society, William Cortazzi, Che mEng2, was put in his departmental letter-rack. The letter,\nfrom the Houses of Parliament\nwas stolen within a couple of\nhours.\nThe Secretary has had to write\nto all Parliamentarians with whom the Society has been corresponding to explain what\nhas happened so that we can find\nthe tradition of exporting high\ntechnology to the South can do\nimmense harm to the culture of underdeveloped countries. Imperial College\nis a singularly appropriate place to\ninvestigate new concepts in engineering,\" she said.\nThe Venice Summit in June 1980,\nwhich was a meeting of the political\nleaders \"of the Western World and\nJapan, did not consider the Brandt\nReport seriously because priority was\ngiven to attacking inflation. However,\nthere has been an encouraging\nindividual response in the United\nKingdom as over 50,000 copies of the\nReport have been sold. \" I hope that\nyou have a group at Imperial who arc\ninterested in organising local\ncampaigns to argue the case put by the\nReport. So often campaigns die - this\none better not die,\" said Mrs\nWilliams. The Rector, The Lord\nFlowers, commented that the Report\nis on sale at the IC bookshop price\n\u00a31.95.\nPeace\nFinally, using the words of Willy\nBrandt, \"If reduced to a simple\ndenominator, this Report deals with\npeace. War is often thought of in terms\nof military conflict, or even\nannihilation. But there is a growing\nawareness that an equal danger might\nbe chaos - as a result of mass hunger,\neconomic disaster, environmental\ncatastrophes, and terrorism. So we\nshould not think only, of reducing the\ntraditional threats to peace, but also of\nthe need for change from chaos to\norder.\"\nColin Palmer the sender and discover the contents.\nHowever the reputation of the\nCollege (and the society) will\ninevitably be tarnished where it\nmatters most, in the Houses of\nParliament.\nAs a Conservative Society we\nare committed to make people\nmore aware of the philosophy\nand policies of the Conservative\nParty. As an IC Social Club we\nare committed to enhancing the\nquality of life of the IC student.\nThe main way to combine these\ntwo commitments is to exploit\nour position in South Ken and invite good outside speakers to\naddress meetings at College whe hare free and open to non members.\nAnything which jeo pardi ses our ability to attract speakers of\nthe highest calibre, ought therefore to be of en cern to all thoughtful students.\nIf the thief ever joins that set of\npeople even for a moment, then\nhe must realise that the letter\nought to be returned.\nTours faithfully\nMark Clegg\nPage 4 FEUX, January 30,1961\n\n"

    "content": "Founded in1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union Student in\nHealth\nCentre after\nSouthside\nmeal!\nAnIC student, Abid Ali Dost, a Chemistry PG, received a cut lip\non Tuesday evening while eating\na meal in the Southside Refectory.\nHe had been eating Pizza rice\nand salad in the main Southside\nDining Room, when he cut the\ninside of his lip on a piece of glass\napproximately one centimetre\nlong. The glass came from his\nmeal, so he went back to the\nserving point with two friends.\nWhen he complained, he was\ntold that a bowl containing the\nsalad was chipped, and it was\nthought that the glass came from\nthere. Mr Dost was taken to the\nHealth Centre at 6 : 0 0 pm for medical attention.\nMr Dost told FELIX that he\nthought it strange that the Southside staff should know of\nsuch a hazardous bowl, as they\ncould identify it immediately,\nbut still serve from it. He added\nthat the way the matter had been\ndealt with in Southside made it\nappear that such events were an\neveryday occur ance. On returning to Southside later, the offending bowl was still\nbeing used to serve salads from,\nand it was not removed, until a further complaint was made.\nWhen FELIX telephoned Mr Mooney, he said that he knew\nnothing about the affair, as it had\nnot been reported to him. When he was asked about the chipped\nsalad bowl, he replied that it was\nonly hearsay, and he would not\ncomment on it.\nETHER PAD ATTACK!\nA young woman was attacked last Saturday night as she walked home to her flat In Princes\nGate Mews behind Southside. Her assailant, a man In his early forties, seized her from behind\nand held a pad soaked In ether against her face. Luckily she was able to fight off the man, who\nfled Into the darkness.\nThe girl, who is the niece of an\nImperial College lecturer, was\nEnd of World\nSmash Hit\nON TUESDAY, JANUARY 20, the world did not come to an end.\nThe JCR was not even wrecked, which is usually inevitable after\nJCR parties. The party was a fancy dress affair, the idea being\nthat the participants should come as they would never have\ndared were it not for the promised holocaust. One would think\nmost people would never have dared to go in jeans and T shirts\nbearing such varied motifs as 'RCS Union', 'Imperial College', and\n'Hi, I'm boring, what's your excuse?', but they did, so one\nsupposes that's OK.\nSome people did honour the spirit of the occasion as witnessed\nby the above photograph. Left to right is the FELIX cow gum\nmonitor, Steve Goulder, as Ali-Baba (it was supposed to be\nAyotollah Khomeini), Editor of The Phoenix, Sean Gib/in, in a cute pair of gf asses, Editor of FELIX, Dwight Mann, complete with\nnuts, and last but definitely not least, J Christ as Ken Mann\n(Dwight's brother), the person who writes all those silly SF Sock\narticles in FELIX.\nal king home through the churchyard of Holy Trinity, Brompton, at10:00 pm last Saturday when she noticed that a man was following her. He followed her into the mews, and\nso she walked round the end of\nthe row of cottages so that her\na lk home would not take her\nthrough the narrow passage\nwhich connects the two parts of\nthe mews. She had almost reached the safety of her flat\nwhen the man attacked, presumably intending to rape her.\nHolding the girl from behind, he\nput his arms beneath hers and forced an ether pad against her\nmouth and nose.\nFortunately the girl was able\nto sink her teeth into the thumb\nof the hand which held the pad to\nher face. She also gave several\npiercing screams which attracted\nthe attention of local residents\nincluding students in Southside.\nThe area was soon swarming\nwith police, but the man fled and\navoided being caught.\nFemale students are reminded\nof the dangers of walking alone in\nthe area behind Southside at\nnight. II anyone cannot avoid\ndoing so, they should get in touch\nwith Rae Snee in the Union Office who will be happy to\nadvise them on hiring or buying\nrape alarms.\nU GM QUANDARY The date of the next UGM was\nhurri d ly altered last week, when it\nwas realised that bylaw changes\ngiven their first reading on\nDecember 2 could not be put to the\nUGM on February 19. The meeting\nwas brought forward, and the\ndeadline for motions therefore\npassed yesterday.\nSee page 5\nNo. 574 Friday, January 30,1981 Free!\n\n"

    "content": "Council Report\nIn the President's report, it was decided that as the Union had no control\nover supervision of College bars, and no financial connection, it should not\nbe called upon to provide duty officers in the bars at weekends. Order in\nthe bars, it was thought, should be the responsibility of the Bar Manager.\nMr Passmore proposed a change in the way sabbatical salaries are reckoned\nwhich would keep such salaries in line with postgraduate grants in future\nyears, and be easier to calculate. This was accepted. On the FELIX controversy the President said he was happy with last week's issue, not just\nbecause it contained one letter expressing a derogatory opinion of Mr Marshall's editing so far. Questioned on the matter he said that he had only\nbeen prepared to take further action, not that he would take such action in\nany case. He did not think that he had climbed down over this matter. Dr Schroter was now happy that the original offending article did not\nrepresent the views of the whole Union, after being assured by the six\nExecutive members that it did not. It was suggested by the meeting that the\noriginal article was self-evidently not meant to be taken seriously and that\nnowhere in last week's FELIX was there the apology from Mr Marshall\nthat had been demanded from him, but these views were not widely held at\nthe meeting.\nRae Snee said in her report that the clear profit from amusement\nmachines run by the Union was \u00a33,148 this session.\nThe subject of casual staff in the bars was raised, but as bar managers\nneed only get Mr Mooney's go-ahead on any day, the situation was left as it\nis. The possibility of removing Union regalia from the bookshop was\ndiscussed.\nLiz Lindsey, in her report, said that things were starting to happen about\nIN COST( International Conference of Students of Technology).\nUNESCO from Paris intended to give $1,000 in sponsorship. She\ncontinued by saying that plans were being considered to re-arrange the two\nlower levels of Southside into a \"post-experience\" centre, but retaining the\nshop, which takes over \u00a3300 each day.\nThere was heated discussion over two matters in the major subcommittee chairman's report. The first concerned a request from the\nHolland Club to use Squash Courts in College for a limited period each\nweek. In theory this was thought acceptable, but in practice, the facilities\nwere well used at present, and any specific time allocation would be\ndifficult to make.\nIn the discussion on the P WP report, it was argued that Mr Mooney\nshould not be\" \"let off the hook\" for the \"dish slop\" he continued to offer.\nMr Passmore explained that he was elected on a platform of co-operation\nwith College authorities, and that each service, e.g. refectories, nursery and\nac como dati on had to pay for themselves.\nThe main point of the Publication Board Report concerned the actions\nthis term of the FELIX Editor. Whilst it was generally acknowledged that\nthere had been no apology as such, it was thought that there had been a sufficiently fair explanation of the situation which represented an apology\nto Mr Mooney. It was noted that there was an apology as such to Miss Rae\nSnee.\nThe other reports from R CC,S CC,S CAB,OS C and Rag were\naccepted.\nWhen the meeting reached other business, Nick Morton, ACC Chairman, proposed that Council should say that it believed RC C should\nhave a uniform low subscription rate for its members. He thought that the\nUnion should provide a service for its members and should ask College to\npay for major expenses. After much discussion the motion was accepted.\nWelsh injured in Wales!\nVICKY WELSH of Physics 2\nsuffered multiple bruises after\nslipping thirty feet down the\nmountain Trefan in Snowdonia\non Saturday January17 whilst\non a Scout and Guide Club Weekend with twenty three others.\nThe group had split into two\nfactions: fifteen went to Snowdon\nand eight to Trefan (one staying\nin Bethesda). However, weather\nconditions were worse than expected so that the Snowdon\nparty, which contained several\nnovices to climbing, although\nusing ice-axes and roping themselves together in two places, had\nto turn back only about100 yards from the top of Gri bG och for fear that if they then walked\nalong the ridge to Snowdon the\nstrong winds, deep snow and\ndriving hail might be too danger-ous.T he Trefan party were more\nexperienced and succeeded in\ngetting to the top of Trefan in\none piece not withstanding Vicky's slip at a point when they\nwere not roped together and there was no one behind her.\nWhen asked whether her life had\nflashed in front of her eyes, Vicky said: \" No,I was just thinking\nI 've got to hold on to some-thing!\"' The party then walked\nalong the top and came down by\nShack\nShock\nShock!!\nLAST WEEK, FELIX incorrectly reported the demise of the\nHAM SOC Shack on the top of the\nUnion Building. This should have\nread 'on the top of the Electrical\nEngineering Department'. The temporary HAM SOC Room in\nthe Union Building is quite intact.\nThe Union has asked the\nEstates Department to replace\nthe shack after they removed it to\nrepair the roof. However, the\nEstates Department have told the\nUnion that it would cost \u00a31,500\nNegotiations are currently underway with Hector Cameron Clark, the Senior Estates Surveyor, to reduce this bill.\nHamsoc\nrule the\nwaves\nLAST MARCH, I CHam soc came first in the English section\nof the ARR L Contest. The American Radio Relay League\n( ARR L) is the coordinating body\nfor amateur radio in the USA. The scoring of the contest is\nbased on the number of contacts\nmade worldwide.\nAlthough Hamsoc has entered\nthe contest in the past this is the\nfirst time they have won. Other British entries are usually made\nby companies in the field of\nelectronics who have more sophisticated equipment than Hamsoc.\nIt is unlikely that the Society\nwill be able to enter the contest\nthis year since the present shack\nin the Union Building is not\nsuited for worldwide operation.\nThis is unfortunate since G5Y C( IC's transmitting station), had\nthe reputation of being one of the\nbest transmitting signals out of\nEurope.\na different route and it was only\nafter Vicky' s bruises had swelled\nup to their full glory that she\nfound that she couldn't bend her\nknee and could only limp around\nBethseda. The following day while\nthe experienced cli rh. be rs tackled\nSnowdon, some others climbed\nTre fan and some chastened Snowdon survivors walked around the hills surrounding Bethseda and down to the Menai Straits and back. Vicky' s comment on this was \" I feel like a cripple\".\nScout and Guide Club will be\nvisiting Wales again this week-end.\nFELIX\nBlues\nTHE UNION PRINT UNIT has been facing technical difficulties recently, resulting in the\nlate production of FELIX during\nthis term.\nProblems started in the second\nweek of term when the Multi li th1850 offset lithography printing\nmachine broke down. No engineer was able to repair it until\nThursday afternoon, and this\nmeant that FELIX was not\nprinted until Friday. Hence, it\nwas distributed on Monday. Meanwhile, the typesetter developing machine broke on\nFriday. The model is ni longer\nmade, so spare parts would be difficult to come by, and a replacement\nwould cost over \u00a3600. However,\nan engineer called on Monday, and fixed it with a piece of string.\nLast Thursday, disaster struck.\nThe phototypesetter stopped producing images on paper to be\ndeveloped. Although the firm\nwas rung immediately, it was\nmid afternoon before anyone arrived. Whilst the Editor, Steve\nMarshall, was considering having copy typed on an ordinary\ntypewriter, the clutch on the\nprinting machine broke. In the\nface of the mounting difficulties\nMr Marshall decided that FELIX would not be published\nlast week.\nThe typesetter was repaired by\nreplacing the lighting unit. This\nmeant, however, the internal elect on ics were causing problems\nas the new lighting unit was not\ncomp a table with the old electronics. So a further engineer\ncalled to replace yet more of the\nmachine. At the time of writing\nthis article, fingers were being\nfirmly crossed.\nSouthside\nSlasher\nA NUMBER of Princes Gardens\nresidents have been getting more\nthan they bargained for when parking cars illegally in Princes\nGardens and behind Linstead Hall.\nThe usual action is for a large\nsticker (warning the driver that the\nregistration number has been noted\nand a fine will be imposed if the car\nis parked illegally again) to be\nfirmly glued to the back window.\nIt now appears as if some people\nare taking the law into their own\nhands by piercing tyres of cars that\nshouldn't be there. In three days\nlast week, seven tyres from four cars\nhave been ruined in a similar\nmanner \u2014 namely the side of the\ntyre being punctured causing irreparable damage. The damage\nis done so as not to be immediately\nobvious, e.g. at the ker b or next to\na wall. Further, the cars were not\nall parked in the same allocated\nspace, and some were not parked in\nan allocated space at all.\nFEUX, January 30, 1981 Page 3\n\n"

Typical cost is \u00a35\u00a310. Accomodation is in huts or camping (club\ntents).\nThe next event after the Dinner Meet to\nLlamberis (starting this evening) will be in a fortnight's time. Location will depend on the\ndriver, who shouts loudest, the weather, and,\nperhaps, democracy. To find out more, see us in\nthe Union Lower Lounge on Tuesday evenings\n(9:00pm onwards \u2014 look for the noisy American\nshouting loudest); watch the club noticeboard\n(outside the same room); or contact Leo\nHermacinski, Hec Eng 2 or Dave Scott, Life Sci 2.\nAstrosoc\nASTROS OC is the society for all those of you\ninterested, in one way or another, in astronomy\nYou can forget about astrology and science-fiction, if you join us you can find out about real\ndeep-space adventure and experiences, first-hand, the very real excitement in observing\nobjects even older than mankind. For a little light\nrelaxation you can consider the beginning of the\nUniverse and ponder afresh on how it will end\n(not on the 20th January!). Science fiction may\nlook to \"where no man has gone before\" but\nastronomy can take you there!\nThe society exists to provide facilities for both\nthe theorists and the practically minded \u2014 we\nown six-inch and eight-inch Newtonian reflectors\nas well as a12 inch Cassegrain. The latter is\ncurrently inoperative (it is in lots of little bits \"in\nhalf an observatory in Silwood Park!), but we\nhope, with the help of new members, to rebuild\nthe telescope and to complete the observatory in\nthe near future. Other projects being considered\nare the building of radio telescope and/or solar\ntelescope. If anyone has any further j de as for\nprojects our Equipment Officer will be most\npleased to hear from them.\nTurning away from the practical side of\nastronomy, we have a number of films and talks\nplanned for this term. Dates for your diary are:\nJanuary27, Film 'Challenge and Promise',\nPhysics LT1,1:30 pm; February5, Film 'Universe', Physics LT2, 1:30pm; February 13,\nDr Gary Hunt 'The Voyager Project', Physics\nLT1, 1:00pm; February 26, Dr John Taylor\n'Black Holes', Physics LT1, 1:00pm.

This is a very interesting period in\nBritish social history; the election of a Labour\nGovernment, hopes for a brave new world, the\nsetting up of the UN, before cynicism, the\nBerlin crisis, the iron curtain and disillusionment set in. We are led to suppose that\nwe are seeing the period through the eyes of\na 'typical' Midlands working class family, in\nparticular those of the central character, Sandra. We see their hopes, fears and anxieties: the men coming back, then not\ncoming back, socialism.\nHowever, as in so many of Stephen Lowe's plays, he fails to make a coherent point. If he\nwrote it as a mood piece, a social documentary, then he succeeded; as a play it does not.\nThe threads are not woven but tangled, the\nplot vague and patchy. I think Mr Lowe has\nexcellent material tor aTV soap opera, but\ntheatre must be more positive and direct.\nIf you like industrial working class humour\ntinged with tragedy then this is the play for\nyou, however threadbare the storyline, the\nmood is there, there is some fine acting by\nMarjorie Yates as Sandra, Sharon Duce as her\nworldly sister and Mike Packer as the\npathetically intense Johnny. It plays at the\nRoyal Court Theatre until late March.\nHere's a funny thing\nJohn Bardon, recently seen in a supporting\nrole in All The Trimmings, with Roger Mc Gough, returns to the Lyric Studio to star\nas Max Miller, the \"Cheekie Chappie\" in a play written by RW Shakespere (no relation).\nApparently Max Miller was a famed Music\nHall artiste before and after the war. The\nperformance largely consists of jokes and\nsketches, including various catchphrases, some of which sounded vaguely familiar.\nHaving never seen the real thing in action\n(Mr Miller died in 1963) I could not vouch for\nthe accuracy of Mr Bardon's performance. I can only say that he delivered the performance\nwith Bounce and Verve, which may have been\nreminiscent of the man himself.\nIt was an enjoyable carefree evening with\nplenty of laughs and groans heartily recommended for the nostalgic amongst you.\nIt plays at the Lyric Studio until the end of the\nmonth.\nLee Paddon\nMech Eng Soc\nWE ARE SORRY about the last minute cancellation of the visit to Perkins' Engines in\nJanuary. This was due to circumstances beyond\neven our control; Massey-Ferguson is going bust!\nThe next visit is to the NATIONAL GAS TURBINE ESTABLISHMENT at Pye stock, Farnborough on Wednesday, February 25. This\nwill be an all day visit. For further details, see the\nMech Eng Soc noticeboard.\nOur first lecture meeting of the term will take\nplace in ME542 on Tuesday, February 3 at\n1:00pm when Maurice George from Harwell will\npresent a talk on the Fusion Reactor.\nThe really exciting news is that in the very near\nfuture, you will be able to purchase \u2014 at very\nreasonable rates \u2014 your very own Mech Eng Soc\nsweatshirt. Stay tuned!\nA Gardam\nCRASH! The Captain's head hit the deck. For\nthis very reason he never learnt the mind-expanding news that had caused mild hysteria on\nseveral of the major land masses of our oh so\nhumbled planet. Coming soon \u2014 more popular\nthan Quintet \u2014 more intellectually stimulating\nthan Star Trek - The Movie \u2014 more spectacular\nthan Blake's Seven \u2014 more restrained than\nRollerball \u2014 yes, it's \u2014 what is it? Oh yes, it's Santa Claus Conquers The Martians, the film\nthat does for cinema what Larry Niven did for the\nOxford English Dictionary. Lex Luthor once said\nthat he would unravel the mysteries of the\nuniverse by reading the back of a bubble-gum\nwrapper. This however, has nothing to do with\nSanta Claus Conquers the Martians. (Soundtrack\navailable from SF Sock Tapes Ltd.) Come to\nMech Eng 220 on February 3 at 6:30pm and be\namazed. Santa Claus Conquers The Martians is\ndefinitely one of the top five worst films ever\nconceived by the mind of man.\nWe might \u2014 mind you I just said might \u2014 be\nhaving a short second feature called Hardware\nIVars. Little is known of this film, but those who\nhave seen it tasted and found it good (i.e. funny).\nI write this fresh from a game of 'call my bluff\nreplete with weird tales of eldritch sex acts on\nother planets. Result: a draw, proving that the\ncommittee are all equally strange. Oh well, that's life, boy.\nAnd now, a mention for Steve Ridley. This shy\nun assuring student of mechanical engineering has\nmissed every single SF Sock event this year, and\nit's not his fault. He deserves our deep sympathy\nand respect. Also he hasn't been mentioned in\nFELIX for ages. Keep it up Steve.\nItem: an astrophysicist at Bedford College has\ndeveloped the theory that the starship Enterprise\nis made of concrete. He is currently engaged in a long term study; watching every Star Trek\nepisode to check for wheelbarrows. I will relay his\nfindings as I receive them. That's all for now folks.\nSee you in the next FELIX, if it exists.\nYours in stasis.\nRoland\nToday\nDinner and Dance\nThursday, February 5\nGen Comm\nFriday, February 6\nChem Eng Soc Annual Dinner\nSaturday, February 7\nInter-Hall Rag Collection\nTHE NEW sweatshirts have arrived at last!
