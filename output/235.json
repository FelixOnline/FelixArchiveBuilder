    "content": "FELLX\nIC Hypnotism\nSee& Feel Brigitte\nFor their first meeting of the year Wells Society certainly picked a crowd puller. By7.20, Room408 E.E. was full and there was still a queue waiting. Happily thanks to the\nmiracle of closed circuit television\nall were able to see and hear.\nThe speaker, Dr. Warne Beresford, began by giving a brief introduction\nto the subject of hypnotism. In view of what was to follow, his statement\nthat nobody could be hypnotised\nagainst their will was found exceedingly comforting. The correct con ditions for hypnosis are, it seems, a competent hypnotist, and a subject\nwith complete faith in him. He also\nstated that even a very good subject\n(somnambulist) who goes very easily\ninto a deep trance could not be conditioned to behave in an uncharacteristic manner, unless they were very\nweak willed. After several remarks\na but other effects particularly the\nthera put ic ones he began his demonstration. For quick demonstrations Dr. Warne Beresford stated, he would like some somnambulists. To find\nUnruly\nBook Sale\nOn Tuesday11 th October a large\nunruly crowd descended on Me ch.Eng.: within30 minutes about 1 2 0\nbooks had been sold and15 removed surreptitiously. The total value of those paid for was over \u00a3 1 1 0 .\nThere are still some books unsold and these can be viewed in the temporary Union Office Room474 Me ch.Eng. All those who handed in books to be sold should collect\ntheir money at 1.00 p.m. Friday21 st October, from Room474 Me ch.Eng. Wanted\nFilm Soc. urgently requires an experienced 16 mm projectionist. En quires to Roger Sym via the Union Rack. them, if any were present, he pro cee ded to try mass hypnotism on the audience. At the end of the ex peri ment, three somnambulists were found, two of them women. Though seemingly nervous ( and who wouldn't be?) they all agreed\nto act as subjects. Dr. Warne Be res ford then proceeded with the help of two friends and fellow hypnotists\nColonel Crook and Inspector Mun ns to completely immobilize the m,an aes that i sea leg, to impose a block\non speaking either odd or even\nnumbers and to teach them how to\nput themselves into a light trance.\nOn his remarking that this could be\nused as an aid to learning the already\nhigh interest increased.\nWhen answering questions later,\nDr. Warne Beresford was asked if\nit was possible to induce a person to\nsee something or someone not there.\nHe replied certainly and asked the\nmeeting who they would like to see.\nA general cry went up for Brigitte\nBardot. Dr. Warne Beresford replied that it was quite possible and that\nnot only could a subject be made to\nsee Miss Bardot but they could actually feel her. The reaction was what would be expected, and shortly after-wards the meeting ended, after a very interesting evening.\nAfter the meeting I talked ot one\nof the three somnambulists, Miss Jane\nA krill. Jane said she had found hypnosis a weird sensation, mainly blissful and restful and that while nervous beforehand she was quite all right under hypnosis.\nActing\nRector\nSir Owen Saunders, FRS, Pro Rector and Professor of Mechanical Engineering, has been appointed as\nActing Rector, following the recent\ndeath of Sir Patrick L instead. Sir Owen Saunders was Dean of\nthe City and Guilds College of the Imperial College from195564, and was Head of the Mechanical Engineering Department from194665.

Open ll7 pm. daily(115.30) Monday& Wednesday Subdued Meeting\nfor Guilds\nOn Thursday the6 th. of Oct. Guilds held their first Union meeting,\ndirected mainly at the Freshers'. Due to the great preponderance of F res hers the meeting was unusually sub-due d and the members of the Executive could actually be heard.\nPete Roberts, this years President introduced the Executive, who briefly\nexplained their somewhat dubious\nDebateable\nMorality The first debate of the new session,\nwhich brought a confrontation\nbetween Mr. Black ham of the\nBritish Humanist Society and Arch bishop Roberts, S.J., was poorly at tended.\nMr. Black ham, in proposing the motion that \" morals should be seperated from religion\" asserted that\nmorals commonly had been in de pen dent of religion as borne out by the evidence of anthropologists. Morals were a function of society which did not require external sanctions, and he cited the Highway Code as a simple example.\nChris Yew let t of I.C. Huxley Society added that since morals were often tied to religion, the obvious\ndecline in the latter would lead to\na regrettable decline in the former,\nunless morals could be shown to be independent of religion.\nThe motion was so badly worded that Archbishop Roberts was able to\nagree with much of what the prop os ers said. He seized upon the word\" should\" in the motion, however, and vigorously denied that those whose\nmorals were inspired by religion\nshould be so persecuted that their\nreligion was forcibly set aside.\nMike Hopkins reinforced this point.\nOthers might make moral judgments\nhowever they wished, but for what valid reason should the morals of a Christian, for example, be separated\nfrom his religious belief?\nThe necessary distinction between\npublic and private morals was po in ted by Mike Edwards, and after\nseveral more speeches from the floor\nthe House voted according to its\npreconceived idea and the motion\nwas lost by27 votes to 2 2 with7 abstentions.\npurposes in life.\nAlthough probably highly informative and useful it was net vry entertaining and it was not un'i lt ii e, ip pear ance of Vice President Phi' Marshall that the Freshers got a tast( .\nof what a real union meeting is like.\nHe gave a resume of the \" sport\" events of the year, with particular\nreference to Morphy Day. He emphasised that nobody actually got\nhurt and Guilds always won anyway.\nThe meeting ended, after preliminary practice, with the t radi. ional Boo malak a and the President just\nmanaged to lift Spanner.\nLaithwaite\nflays\nElec Eng In the middle of a lecture and demonstration given to fresh es by the\nEng. Soc., Prof. Lai thwaite broke ot f his lecture on induction motors to at tack the I.C. policy of encouraging\ngraduates to enter industry im media t ely upon graduating \" to do a3 years\nprobation\". Industry does very lU tle\" real\" research, most so-called research being simply development of\nproven concepts. This development\nwork and constant worrying about\ntarget dates, he claimed, often dulled bright men who were unable to\nreturn to university research de partments because of financial pressures. The Professor said he believed in doing research into new concepts and claimed that although applications\nwere not obvious at first, they soon\nfollowed. He accused the Electrical Engineering department of \" brainwashing\" bright under gar duat es, who were needed for research teams, into\ngoing straight into industry, and hoped he was not too late to warn the\nfresher s against this. Bright under-graduates, he said, were always welcome to conic and see him and discuss doing research into machines.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 9\nGONE WEST\nYOUNG MEN\nA PARTY OF twelve cricketers, led by L.C. Williams, left the\nUnion on the 28th of June, bound for the West Country. The first\ngame, theoretically, against Southampton University, was unfortunately cancelled, and so we arrived at Bridport, and our first hotel,\nrather earlier than expected.\nThat evening, we had our first\ntaste of the West Country brews and were also introduced to the local\nforms of ten-pin bowling. Next day we moved to Torquay and our first game, which proved very enjoyable. Tho result was a draw. At the close of play I.C. needed fourteen runs to win, with one wicket in hand. After the game we piled into the coach and drove down to Plymouth, where we spent three\nnights. Here we played two games,\nthe first against II. M.S.' Drake' we lost by28 runs. An early batting col lapse being the main cause of the\ndisaster. The second game against\n' Plymouth College Staff' was drawn, a creditable performance since the\nPlymouth team included two Devon Minor County spin bowlers.\nOn Saturday we returned to\nTorquay and our last hotel, and then\ndrove along the coast to Bab bacombe. Here we overcame the home side by79 runs, in spite of the rather un usual ground. That evening, our bests\nentertained us at a local club, where we enjoyed ourselves until the early\nhours of the morning. On Sunday afternoon we played' Whim ple and White ways', with whom we drew. Here, however, the\nprime object of the I.C. batsmen was not so much run-scoring, but winning the quite considerable dropped catch kitty. This could be achieved\nby hitting a tree-trunk in the out-field. Nobody, in fact succeeded and so the money was claimed by the captain for making the top score.\nWe drew again on the Monday with' Brixham' \u2014 even allowing for the unorthodox bowling efforts of\ncertain I.C. members. Tuesday, our only free day, unfortunately turned out to be dull and damp. Thus the\nparty was reduced to filling in time\nat the local ' pitch and put' course\nand amusement arcades.\nThe next day our opponents were Paignton, who proved too strong a team and we lost by six wickets. The tour, though, did finish on a winning note, as the following day we defeated ' Royal Marines' at Ly mp stone. The match provided an exciting finish, the victory being by just one wicket.\nSoccer\nA Good Start\nTHE SOCCERCLUB has made an extremely successful start to the season. On Saturday the l st. II beat\nSouthampton for the first time in five years, and all the other teams\nare doing equally well, except for the1 seconds The record shows that the\nonly team to loose a game is the\nseconds,\u2014in fact all other games\nhave been won, the fifths holding the record for the highest score, if this\nearl v promise bears fruit the Soccer\nClub is in for one of its' most successful seasons for along while. So the total record was two won, two lost and four drawn. Even if the\nresults do not appear too impressive,\nthe tour proved very enjoyable for all concerned and was certainly a good method of recovering from hours spent in examination rooms.\nJ.P. Atkins\nLine out on the Sanderhurst ' 2 5 ' , before I.C.'s second try. Photo by D.Orm is ton. SANDHURST\nDEFEATED\nSportlight\nTHE SEASON BEGINS\nAT THE BEGINNING of each academic year the College sports'\nclubs hope, above all, for success\u2014naturally enough. For this to\nbecome a reality, and not just a castle in the sky dream, hard work\nis required from both player and official alike. A lack of first class\ntalent is no excuse for despondency. An average team, well organ iz ed, is as good as a team of individual y good players, without\norganization.\nFrom the club officials, keenness and interest must pass to the players,\nand vice versa. To the players tine nth. team is as important as the l st.and for club spirit, an important key to success, must be treated as such. There must, also, be room for merit to make headway. Selection through' in group' friendship will only harm a club and its' record.\nWe all know that it gets cold and wet in winter; some games will involve a lot of travel; grounds' are tricky to find and matches get cancelled; \u2014\nbut this is not unexpected. If you've 'signed on' to play for the College than all this should have been taken into consideration. A 'fine day' player is no asset to any club, and will soo find this is so. If a game is worth playing the it's worth a little effort, and hardship. Of the league, cup and friendly games the cup competitions carry the\nmost glory. In these games, support is needed from the College. The Rugby Club appear to have this well organized, but this is not the rule,\nmore the exception. Last year the Soccer Club was involved in two finals,\nyet no more than a dozen supporters appeared \u2014 there this definitely room for improvement.\nLet's hope then, that dreams can come true, and there are sufficient people\nwilling to work for them. The College could do with a few more cups\nin the cupboard. A. Robins\nI.C.9 pts.\nSandhurst 3 pts.\nON A FINE day at Blenheim\nPark the I.C.l st. XV defeated a fit, well drilled Sandhurst side by\nthree tries to one. The early stages\nof the play went to I.C., mainly\ndue to the domination of the\nCollege pack. Sandhurst opened\nthe scoring, completely against\nthe run of play, when their\ncentres seized on a mistake by\ntheir opposite numbers. This\nspurred I.C. to greater af forts and\na brilliant movement, followed\nby a quick heel saw Mills sending Riley in at the corner\u2014\nMolan failed to convert.\nHopalong\nRowing\nAlmost There\nTHIS YEAR THE College rowing 'four' won three Junior Senior\nevents, but lost in the final of the\nVisitors Challenge Cup at Henley.

Its\npurpose as well as being a social\ngathering was to acquaint the un initiated with the philosophy of humanism. A short talk on the sub-j ect, entitled, \" An introduction to Humanism,\" was given by the head of the Applied Maths, department at Kings, Professor Hermann Bondi. After tea the Professor kindly agreed\nto answer questions and stayed on for some time.\nIn his speech Professor Bondi first\ngave, a theoretical outline of humanism and then proceeded to take practical examples and explained how humanism would approach them. Humanists, he said, do not base their\nway of life on the doctrine of religion or in fact on any doctrinaire institution. The essence of humanism is\nthat conclusions are reached by rational argument instead of taking\nas correct the word of a higher authority. There is nothing wrong with the beliefs of these authorities, such as religion, unless they attempt to force their views, which are ' only their particular views, onto the masses of the population. Humanists are\naware that they are not themselves\ninfallible and are open minded in their approach to the problems of\nhumanity and society.\nProfessor Bondi then proceeded with. several examples in support of\nhis theories, firstly that of divorce.\nThe Church Opposes this be cause it is completely prejudiced on the grounds of an outdated morality\nand supports its doctrine with laws\nand moral codes of a different age\nA humanist has no such prejudices\nand can study all aspects of divorce,\nfor example such things as the causes of it, the effect that it will have\non the children of the family, and by rational thought can com* to a conclusion which will be to the\nmutual benefit of all those involved. The Professor had a bone to pick with the teaching of religion in schools. This is the only subject\nwhich is compulsory by law in English schools. He was against the\ndoc tr in a ting of religion into young children whose views thus became distorted long before they could formulate their own. The term Professor\nBp ndi used was\" Daily Telegraph\" Christianity, which, he warned, dem and s that religion be given to the\nchildren, even if there is no truth in it, merely to prevent juvenile delinquency. Here the Professor brought his\nspeech to a conclusion and waited until after tea to answer questions.\nThen there was a general forum producing many a lively question and many an intelligent retort. The speech had not only, proved to be\nsound basically, but had stimulated\nideas in the audience.\nDuring tea a vote of thanks was proposed by the Chairman of the\nSociety, Martin Tobias.\n,..

This was well illustrated by the supposed expansion of the Admiralty' s manpower with the contraction of its fleet. This flow of labour from the ships towards\noffices is part of a general trend of\npeople towards the administration of work and away from the work itself.\nHowever, this does not necessarily\nmean a decrease in the amount of labour required. The result of install ing computers in American industries\nwas to create more work for more\ncomputers, thus raising the slightly\nphilosophical question \u2014 \" Will labour-saving devices ever save labour'.\nAlthough, then, one may doubt the nomenclature of labour-saving methods, they will undoubtedly bring considerably greater luxury into the lives of many people in the future,\nand those people will have to learn\nto live accordingly. This distribution\nof greater comfort and wealth, Professor Gabor warned, would be in the hands of some of the audience.\nSafety\nThis year the new College Safety\nCommittee is planning a campaign to reduce the number of accidents\nof all kinds. As a beginning there is\na lecture being given by Dr. R.B. Buzzard entitled SEEING THE RISK. Dr. Buzzard is the Research Director of the National Institute of Industrial Psychology. He will speak\nin the Physics Lecture Theatre I at\n2.15 p.m. on Wednesday19 th. October1966. All members of the staff (teaching,\nresearch and technical) and all students are invited to attend.\nThe initial meeting of ICC on serva t ive Society was well attended and the\nspeech of Conservative M.P., Mr. Van Straubenzee created a good impression for its shortness if not its\ncontent. However, the 'party' as a whole was rather dull and uninteresting; nothing of notable importance\noccur in g.At the meeting a small glass of\nsherry was provided for the price of\ntwo shillings and sixpence and although there were vague rumours\nthat the glasses would be refilled this\ndid not occur.\nTo start the meeting the Lady Chairman introduced the various members or the committee, and Ilnally Mr Van Sfraubenzee, who made as ne ech lasting a mere seven minutes.\nThis speech consisted of his strong\nrca c. ion to proposals that students\ns nou iu oe m aue10 repay tn eir grants\nafter leaving college. Naturally this\nspeech was well received.\nMr. Van Straube n zee then began\nto circulate and attempted to answer\nquestions of political importance. On rUi odes i a, he was not in favour of\nusing fores to quell the rebellion and stated tii at it Britain tried to use\nforce the army would rebel because\nthey refuse to shoot fellow whites in Rhodesia! However, if there was civil war in Rhodesia the army would be sent in at the request of Smith,( in order to shoot black Rhodesians\npresumably).\nOn Viet am he was not in favour\nof giving physical support to the Americans but was in favour of giving ' moral' support. Although, he added, we have little influence on the American sowing to the extent to\nwhich we are in debt.\nMr. Van Straubenzee answered\nvarious other questions but there was little political argument \u2014 probably due to the fact that nearly everyone\nwas st auch ly Conservative. At about\nquarter-to-nine he left and the meeting quietly died out.\nFELIX needs SALESGIRLS Some might call him a zebra. To me he's Socrates. Matches the scarf, too. Difficult in the digs. But not at\nMartins. They understand. They're so friendly at Martins\u2014especially to students.\nMarlins have an especial knowledge of a student's need to budget grants and allowances carefully which is why so\nmany students find it worthwhile to open an account at Marlins. Martins go to extremes to be helpful\nMARTINS BANK. JS J LIMITED "

CHA6081 COLCUU\nComment by the\neditor\nGetting into our stride\nYou will no doubt have noticed the mistakes and blank spaces in the last issue of FELIX. No one regrets\nthis more than we, as it is our aim to produce a newspaper that the Union can be proud of. As the staff, not least\nthe Editor, become more experienced we intend to take new steps for-ward. A good newspaper attracts attention to the College, especially the attention of potential advertisers.\nBut while we can improve the paper from our end, it is the union members who provide us with, news directly or indirectly. It is not possible for FELIX to be everywhere all the time; if your society or club has a meeting which is. interesting \u2014\nand most are \u2014 let us have a report.\nWe cannot guarantee that it will go in but we will do our best. Another way in which FELIX can help clubs\nis by means of the What' sOn column. All that is necessary is that\nyou send us full details of meetings,\neither fortnightly or for the whole term at once.\nOld readers will notice the return\nof Col cut t to this paper. Col cut t is\na pseudonym: the name being that\nof the architect of Queen's Tower. Trie Col cut t column appeared first In\nOctober 1 9 6 1 , some few months\nafter the President was finally and permanently o us. ed from his column. v V li at does he do? Col cut t is on the 'inside'; he has access to what goes on in the union, probably more so than the Editor. This anonymity gives him freedom of speech with out fear of recrimination, his position\nenables him to in form the average\nunion member of failings 'o union a if a i'.s and to comment ire c'.yon other activities.\nLast year there were, for a time, two anonymous columnists. Because\nthese two took full advantage of\ntheir positions as critics, respecting\nneither mann or Executive, the FELIX Board forced the Editor to reveal their names. The new Col cut t begins the year with an assurance of\nhis anonymity and my wishes for\nmore power to his pen. Felix\nSuccess The first edition of FELIX this\nyear set a record in that it sold out in thirty-six hours; in previous years\nsales have risen steadily throughout\nthe term until they reached sell-nut\nfigures. It is, however,, regrettable\nthat not all the sales money was received. The most notable example of\nthis was in the Huxley building where some 30s.0d. was missing.\nOnce again restored to my rightful state of anonymity, I sit, vitriol-tip-ped pen in hand, ready to pour scorn and derision on all and sundry.\nAnxiously, everybody opens his FELIX at Col cut t to see whose turn it is\nto come under the chopper. The Exec, or the Domestic Bursar? The Rugby Club or the Clerk to the Halls? A brief word of explanation here for the benefit of fresher s.Iam one ol the oldest gen tel r.an all. C. having to my credit countless threatened libel suits and the honour of\nhaving designed I.C.'s contribution to the Space Age, the Queen's Tower. I have very few friends.\nThis year got oft to its usual roaring start, with the Union in a state\nof utter chaos. The first Event, the Freshers' Hop, was an unqualified success when one of the groups failed to appear and nine hundred large,\nhot, sweaty people tried to pair themselves off in two small, hot, sweat v rooms. The new Crush Hall bar was very much appreciated by the small group of stalwarts who managed to force their way through to it. It\ncould not have been more aptly named. It appears that the Hop was\narranged by last year's Chairman of Ents and this year's Carnival Organizer, Jim Murray. Unfortunately he did not see eye to eye with his\nexaminers. The organisation should have been taken over by this year's Chairman of Ents, Brian Compton. Unfortunately he did not see eye to eye with his examiners. As an emergency measure last year's unsuccessful\npresidential candidate Keith Guy took over and spent the week prior to the Hop in hospital. It seems a miracle tome that the Hop ever occur red. It' is typical of a malaise that runs through much of the Union, that both Murray and Compton should lose interest and let everybody\nelse sink or swim as best they could, on finding out that they weren't co ming back. Murray, in fact, was given the Union General Award last term for his \"outstanding services to the Union\". Let us say a quiet prayer for the new Ents Committee, if there is one yet. One of my favourite targets for criticism is that section of the Union often to be found disturbing the peace in the neighbourhood of the bar.I regret that I have been pipped at the post by Phil Po y ser this year, who s letter in the last issue of Felix described, accurately \u2014 even moderately,\nthe events at a party at the end of last term. He did not directly attribute\nthe damage to any specific groups, but well known people certainly were well to the fore on that unpleasant occasion. All too often in the past,\nthis irresponsible gang of thugs ( and here I don't refer to the whole bar crowd, only that small, nasty section which insists .on making its presence\nfelt by being a nuisance) who have been allowed to get away with murder because no-one has been big enough to stop them, and many of them have been senior Union officers themselves anyway. This year both the Pre si dent and Deputy President, Duke and McBain, are leading members of\nthe Bar. They are, as we have no reason to doubt, yet, both very responsible people. Let us hope that this year they can exercise some calming influence over their more heavy drinking confr ere s, and prevent a repetition of last year's record of behaviour. If the President can't do it, it\nwon't be long before some-one else, like a new Rector or the Senior\nWarden, decide to take matters into their own hands.\nAs you' no doubt noticed from the number of VACANCIES on FELIX' S staff list, and the lavish Freshers' Crossword, FELIX too started the year\nwith a bang. One good thing, however, is that so far the Editor and Tony Duke are still on speaking terms, \u2014 and Iam still anonymous. Let us hope that this happy state of affairs continues, and that' none of the petty bickering that went on on FELIX Board last year recurs. It's a pious\nhope but genuine. Happy Problem Sheets.\nInaccuracy\nSir\nI would like to correct a state-ment made in the last issue of\nFELIX about failures in Dram soc. There were only four active members who failed to return. As the Society\nhad an active membership of 42 last\nyear, and over 6 0 members, this re presents a failure rate which is about\nthe College average. While it is true\nwe lost some of our most needed\nmembers, the figure is surely remarkably low, especially when one co noid ers how active the Society was last year; as a minor example over\n1000 man hours of work were done by the Society for Carnival Week. It can be said quite fairly that\nthe organised activities of the Dramatic Society did not interfere\nwith the members academic work. Social life is an essential part of the Dramatic Society but people continued to use the storeroom as a social meeting place after Carnival Week despite attempt to discourage\nthis.\nI feel that inaccurate reports in FELIX, especially in its first issue,\nmay give bad impression both in the Union and in the College, the latter\nbeing a very serious matter. It may also discourage other people from joining the Society thus limiting the assistance the Society gives to various\nUnion activities.\nDavid Harris E d.:Ents. Committee failures were\nalso numerically low. Only two members failed these being, however, the Chairman and Secretary, two very important members.\nAS IN THE PAST the Editor will be\npleased to receive letters for public-ation. However, the right to withhold\nfrom publication such letters, either\nin part or in toto, is reserved.\nTHE EDITOR does not necessarily\nagree with the opinions expressed by\nadvertisers, columnists or correspond-ents.\nThat Ad! Sir,\nApropos of the 'Support Rhodesia' advertisement in the last edition of\nfk LIX, Iam at a loss to understand\nhow FELIX could sell itself to such a low and debased theme that violates all canons of human, moral and ethical decency.\ns sum ing that you disassociated\nyourself from the advertisement\n(judging by a footnote) and also that\nyou did get a fat cheque( judging by the space)\u2014it is hardly conceivable\nthat FELIX could prostitute its code of conduct in becoming an outlet to racist and near-fascist propaganda. Surely, the virtues of FELIX are*\nabove this.\nAshok Guruswamy\nstatesman\nNEW\nESSENTIAL READING FOR STUDENTS.

That\nwas the verdict on this year's Freshers' Hop, held on the first Saturday\nof the year.\nThe Hop had seemed a certain\nwinner, with three good groups appearing; one in the Concert Hall, one in the Lower Lounge and one in the Upper Refectory in the Union. Also the new Crush Bar with its\ngreat range of drinks was newly opened and awaiting use (at a cost\nof up to \u00a31500). For this lavish production the I.C. Entertainments Committee received permission from Union Council to raise the ticket price from4 s.0d. to6 s.0d,( presumably to cover the cost of hiring the third group)% Men's tickets sold well and the ad vance issue had all gone by Friday \u2014\nhowever, more were available during the evening and Saturday, and these\ntoo sold out. Entry to the Hop was\nfrustrating ly slow for many of the\ngirls present \u2014 the ladies' cloakroom quickly became full, and over one hundred young ladies queued in the\nQuad for half an hour.\nHowever one of the groups hired by Ents. Committee failed to turn\nup, and as a result there was noone to play in the Upper Refectory. Thus, instead of over eight hundred people\ncramming themselves into three halls\nthey crammed themselves into two, and the notorious 'sweaty cat tld in ark et' atmosphere of previous Freshers'\nHops soon reappeared. Although later\nin the evening a discotheque was started in the Upper Refectory, where the absent group ( ' Mr. Hip') was to have appeared, this failed to significantly relieve the pressure. ,\nEnts. Committee later issued the following statement to FELIX: \u2014\n\" I.C. Entertainments Committee\napologise s that no group was playing\nin the Upper Refectory and for the\nresulting overcrowding of the other\ntwo rooms. One of the booked groups\nfailed to.turn up and this was beyond\nthe Committee's control\"\nA good reception was given to a fine performance by the' Evening Blues' in the lower lounge, but 'Some\nOther Gays' were less successful in the Concert Hall. The' Other Guys' had travelled down from Newcastle( expenses paid by I.C.?) to make one of their first public appearances in London \u2014 indeed one or their first\nanywhere. They have no agent, and so their invitation to appear at I.C. is strange. The mystery is resolved\nwhen it is realised that the appointed chairman of Ents. Committee for last\nyear was Jim Murray. Lead guitarist\nof ' SOG* \u2014 Jim Murray' s brother;\nfemale vocalist of' SOG' \u2014 Jim Murray' s girl. Even those who climbed into the Hop through the lower windows must\nhave wondered whether it was worth it and the hundreds of people who paid6 s.0d. surely expected something\nbetter for their money than Mr. Murray' s' Opportunity Knock s'.Hops are recognized methods of\nraising money for I.C. societies and organizations, and are therefore over-crowded, especially in the Concert Hall and by the Crush Bar.( This has,\nhowever, never before brought forth such comment, or an apology).\nUndoubtedly it is profitable for\nEnts., and sales from the bar which ran virtually dry boosted finances.\nThe increase in takings by the 2s.0d. increase in ticket prices raised \u00a3 8 0 ,\nbut this cannot be explained by hi ring well known groups \u2014 when quest-i one d about the absent group, Keith Guy commented\" It's just another 15\ngn s. profit for us\". As reported in the last issue of\nFELIX, Ents. Committee( a commit tee responsible to I.C. Council) suffered badly from failures, and the positions of Chairman and Secretaiy\nhave still not been finally filled.\nHowever, Peter Bou l den has been\nproposed as Chairman, and Keith Guy( last year's chairman of S CC) has expressed a wish to be secretary.\nSennet agents ignorant\n\" They told me nothing,\" said pert\nblonde Barbara Hedge, I.C.U LU agent. The University newspaper\nSEN NET, which failed to appear\naround I.C. on Tuesday of last week\nhad been delivered to the Messengers' Office in Beit Quad at 4.30 a.m. that day, without any arrangements\nhaving been made for its reception.\nIt remained untouched until noon on\nWednesday, when FELIX enquired of\nMiss Hedge why SEN NET was not\navailable.\nMiss Hedge explained that she had been told last year that she would be informed of the SEN NET publication date, in advance, and her duties exp laine d to her, so that she could organise a team for its distribution.\nHowever, until the approach from FELIX, she had not been contacted,\nand so this issue came out late, with the advertising leaflets not inserted,\nbut laid beside the forlorn piles.\nThis year SEN NET is distributed\nfree. This was not made clear Ly\nthe piles, but only by small hand bills attached to noticeboards in the vicinity. As a result, some money was\nplaced in the nearby FELIX sales\ntins, by well meaning, but misguided, students.\nOne of the many difficulties that\nbeset SEN NET last year was that\nmany of their agents failed to return\nthe cash collected from sales (3d. per en py) to UL U. One issue was can celled due to lack of cash, and only\nafter threats of la gal action was some\nof the money brought in. A courageous decision was made to distribute\nSEN NET free this year in the hope that extra advertising revenue would make up the cash difference. This means that the distributors are no longer pai dId. per copy but give their services free\u2014as do all FELIX staff. It also means that no auditor\ncan check claims of circulation of\nSEN NET, which finished last year\nselling three thousand copies through\nthe then forty one colleges of UL U( less than double the sales of FELIX, and also less than the sales of PI at\nUniversity College). SEN NET claims\nto print and distribute ten dio us and copies this year.\nIt must be pointed out that\nWarwick Fa ville, last years UL U agent at IC, was prompt and completely honest in dealings with SEN NET. At Sir John Cass College the UL U agent (who was also agent there last\nyear) received no notification that it\nwas to be free and thus put out aS EN NET collecting tin. At noon on Thursday this tin contained 1 3 / 3 . The agent stated, ' In fact I have had nothing from SEN NET at all'. FELIX has sent 2 1 / 4 to SEN NET, from FELIX sales tins.\n\n"

These forms re\nlate to the car-parking facilities\navailable to residents. The parking in this are has been under\ncontrol of the ^.S. Car Parking\nCommittee since last year.\nIn the Spring. session, parking in the road outside the Southside Halls had got out of control. Cars parking on both sides of the road had made it impossible for vans delivering to\nS. S. to turn. Some( British Railways and British Road Services) refused to\ndeliver. Apart from this, in the event\nof a Are, the Fire Department, fully\nwithin their rights, would have had to \" shunt\" the cars on the side nearest the Halls. The Rectorial or College Parking Committee decided that parking should be restricted to the North side of the road. To this end they\nerected rather unsightly scaffolding\non the South side to discourage\nwould be offenders. This was fine for\nFire Engines, but a taxi hit the scaffolding and was a complete write off. The scaffolding, although ugly was very effective.\nThe S. S.Car Parking Committee was revived to face the following problems :\n(a) How could S. S. residents retain\nexclusive use of the carpark.( b) How could parking be restricted to one side of the road only.\nThe committee, consisting of a representative from each of the\nHalls, decided that the parking on\nthe North side of the road should be\ndiagonally inclined, and that parking on die South side be restricted by means of double white lines. The car-park would be for the use of\nresidents or registered guests only.\nBy Easter vehicle registration was\ncomplete, and the painters were called in. The resulting markings discouraged\nany dangerous parking. A car could not be parked where other vehicles\nmight bit it. Provisions were also\nmade tor motor-cycles.\nTraffic wardens\nThe new committee has not yet\nbeen formed this year, and so Mr. P.J. Hills sent out the registration\nforms. 25 parking places have been\nlost to the builders during the construction of NewHall, leaving 40\nplaces. The reason no more were lost was that S. S.P.C. stepped in and the contractors decided to use the\nEast Side cul de sac to deliver\nmaterials.\n15 vehicles, either abandoned or\nbelonging to non-residents, were rem ove d from the car-park during the\nSummer. The whereabouts of the\nderelicts are not known. It is to be no fk d that the road and car-park are both College property,\nand at any time the College could withdraw facilities. The committee\nprobably prevented this. The War dens come round to ensure that only\ncars with I.C. stickers use the park,\nand the Committee see that only\nS.

Dickinson, in his own inimitable style, read and once even sang? from quart an who lends his weight to the bringing over the humour and the feeling in Bet jem an' s verse. None the less interesting were his personal in sights of Bet jem an, the eccentric antiquarian who lends his weight to the fight to preserve anything remotely old or reasonably attractive, with notable success in most cases, including that of Col cut's Queens Tower. Patrick Dickinson is an extremely witty and accomplished speaker, and in his appreciation and criticism of\nBet jem an, brought\"* to light the facets\nof his poetry hitherto hidden to' most of those present. The two remain g talks in this series, on Louis Mac Neice and Philip Larkin will undoubtedly be equally as rewarding and interest-ing as this. Certainly, Dickinson' s speaking matched Be jem an' s verse,\nand, in every way, this poetry was a pleasure.\nFELIX Small AdsL C.Ms or FeM s? Are there any M or FeM s at I.C.?
