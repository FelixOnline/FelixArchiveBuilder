It certainly\nstarted well. On New Year's Eve I smuggled two cans of\nshandy up to my room and\ngot legless ly drunk. Woke up this morning feeling\nreally ill. I hope it isn't morning sickness. I was\nwearing nothing but my left\nsock and had a lump of\nconcrete in my mouth. I hope I haven't defaced any\nfamous London landmarks,\nas I am dead patriotic.\nJan 2nd Today on the tube a large\nhairy inebriate informed me\nthat he hated my guts. This surprised me as I do not\nrecall showing them to him.\nThe man is obviously not\nan intellectual like me.\nJan 3\nToday I felt like being kind\nto politically repressed\nminorities so I gave twenty\npence to a man who looked\nlike a liberal. He was not in\nthe least bit grateful. No wonder the Tories run the\ncountry.\nJan 8th Went to my first QT meeting; it was dead\nbrilliant! There were lots of\nREALLY ZANY people\nthere. We sat and\ndiscussed plans for some really FAB Stunts and\nevents. I think I will\nbecome an anarchist when\nI grow up.\nSubmitted by Stephen\nJohnstone Physics 1.\nRunner up in QT writing\ncompetition '85-86'\nmE GR BRR in It'sg ree yut, man!\nThe prestigious leaders of\nTeetotal Soc are trying to\nfind a name for their new\nmascot-a can of Barbican lager. They decide that this\nshould bear the name of\none of the committee\nmembers, and that they\nshould have an election to\nsee which one of them will\nbe remembered by this\ngreat honour.\nThere are six committee\nmembers seated around a circular table: the\nPresident, the Chairman, the Secretary, the\nTreasurer, the Publicity\nOfficer, and an Ordinary\nCommittee Member.\nAncient club tradition\nin s is its that voting take\nplace according to a strict\nset of rules that must all be\nexactly adhered to. The rules are:-1 No member may vote for\nthemselves.\n2 The President and\nChairman can vote for\nanybody except each other.\n3 The member sitting\nopposite the Secretary\nmust vote for the pes on sitting on their left.\n4 Any member sitting two\nplaces away from the\nTreasurer must vote for the\nperson sitting opposite\nthem.\n5 No member may vote for\nthe Ordinary Committee Member if they are sitting\nnext to him.\nIf none of the above rules\ncontradicts each other, and\nthe winner got four votes,\nwho won?

    "content": "Union\nThere seems to be some feeling among departments\nthat academic needs are\nmore important than the\nwelfare and social needs of\nstudents. Many College administrators know that\nthe welfare and social\nneeds of students are as\nimportant as those of the\ndepartments. They know\nthat if sixth former s think\nthat the College has no\nclubs and societies etc,\napplications will drop. The departments, though, seem to be only interested in\nexpanding their research\nwork. I know that the UGC cuts have made it difficult\nfor departments. This doesn't mean, though, that\nthey should try to take\nstudent union resources.\nFor example the FELIX Office and Beit TV Lounge being asked to move. One of the things that they want\nto do with the area is build\na seminar room. There is\nan excess of seminar\nrooms. Does it seem\nexcessive for the College to\nask biology students to use\nseminar rooms in other\ndepartments?\nFELIX\nAs you can see from the\nletters page there has been\na certain amount of\ncriticism of my decision to\npublish the 'Strike FELIX'. I decided that education cuts\nare not a party political\nissue and so could be\ncovered as a feature. When I came to College almost\n3'/2 years ago it was only\n'lefties' who went on demos and joined protests against\neducation cuts. Since then\nit seems to me that Mrs\nThatcher has united\nstudent unions against the\ncuts. Several of my friends\nvote Conservative. Since they came to College they\nhave decided that they\nmust join protests against\ntheir party's education\npolicies. This is because they see the harm that\nthese policies are doing to\nBritain's economy. When I went to lobby MPs I discovered that many back\nbench Conservative MPs oppose the present\nGovernment's education\npolicy (unfortunately, they\nhaven't got the guts to\noppose it in the House). For this reason I decided that the article on cuts was\na feature, not an opinion. I am, though, a great\nbeliever in the right of reply,\nso if John Martin or the\nConservative Society would\nlike to produce two pages\n(approx 1700 words)\ndefending the\nGovernment's education\npolicy, I 'll print it. I find it\ndifficult to believe its\npossible to defend the\nGovernment, but I'm prepared to listen to Mr\nMartin's arguments.\nWhile on the subject of\narticles for future FELIX s,I'd like to challenge the\npeople who wrote to FELIX last term saying that FELIX is boring, to write 400 words on rhino's willies (as\npromised) so that I can\nprint it. Generally, I'm running out of ideas for\nfeatures so if you have any\nideas for opinions or\nfeatures contact me and\neither you or someone else\ncan write the article.\nFELIX Office\nFELIX is your newspaper.\nThis is why I am replying to\nrecent criticism. If the\nproposed move of the\nFELIX Office (as reported\nin FELIX last week and this\nweek) goes ahead, this may\nno longer be the case.\nFELIX may become the\nNewspaper of Imperial\nCollege Union Hacks. This is because the proposed site is out of the way. The present site is passed by\nlarge numbers of students.\nStudents see FELIX staff at\nwork. They know where the\noffice is. This means that\nfeel they can contribute. A student newspaper must be\nin contact with students.\nThis means that it must be\nin a prominent position.\nYou're lucky to have one of\nthe best student\nnewspapers in the country.\nDefend it by preventing the\nmove (campaign details in\na future FELIX).\nEditorial\nJohn Martin has attacked\nmy editorial comments on\nNicaraguan coffee. He has,\nin my view every right to\nattack my views. However,\nhe has no reason to attack\nthe fact that I express them\nin the editorial. The editorial is meant to be\nintelligent comment. It is\nmeant to be my views. That\nmeans that it is meant to\nprovoke thought. Hopefully,\nit will also attract a response in the letters\npage. The editorial is not\nmeant to be facts that every\nstudent will agree with. It is\nmeant to provoke debate.\nValentine's Day\nFELIX is planning a Valentine's Day special.\nWe're going to print the\nSmall Ads over a pink\nheart. If you want to send a message to the love of your\nlife, then drop them into\nFELIX by 1.30pm on\nMonday February 10. If\nyou have any ideas for\nfeatures in FELIX in the\nValentine's issue, contact\nme in the Office.\nCredits\nIt's been an odd week.\nThanks to the following for\nputting up with me and still\ncontributing to FELIX: Dave\nJones, J Martin Taylor, Jim Clay den, Sarah Kirk, Mark\nCottle, Mark Hunter, Bill\nGoodwin, Richard Smith,\nPete Hob b is, Richard Ellis,\nRosemary Hos king, Rob Dwyer Joyce, Kamala Sen, Jane Spiegel, Chris Stapleton, Nige Atkinson, Aaron Kotcheff (Sorry I forgot to add to your\narticle), Chris Edwards.\nChris Dodge, Pete Wilson Alan Rose, Pete Klemperer,\nMike Stone, Gaynor Whyles, Jelly, Dave\nKingston, Nick Shackle y, Andy Vickers, Eugene Z hog and Sunny Bains.\nMegabrain\nThe answer to last weeks\nproblem and the winner will\nbe published in the next\nFELIX.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College\nUnion Publications Board and is printed by Fourth Avenue, 4 Farnham\nRoyal, Kennington.

ISSN 1040-0711\nBouncers Go\nBananas\nDear Mr Southey I wish to inform all the\nreaders of this newspaper\nof a particularly unpleasant\nexperience which I had\nrecently, in the hope that it\nwill not happen to them.\nLast Monday I went to\nthe discotheque ' Bananas' in Ward our St. W l, to\nattend the much publicised\n'Krazy Tie and Loony Sunglasses' party. When I got there, I was told by one\nof the 'bouncers' that he\nwould not allow me in. It\nwas not because of my\ndress, as I was wearing a decent jacket and tie, and I was certainly not drunk.\nWhen I asked him why he\nwould not let me in, his\nimmediate answer was\n'because you're afc king c nt', said in those words. He and the other 'bouncer'\nthen proceeded to spit on\nme. Today I rang the\nmanager of the night club,\nand he stood by his\nbouncers' actions one\nhundred per cent. He told\nme that, had he been in\ntheir shoes, he would have\ndone exactly the same. He finished by saying he had\nbetter things to do than talk\nto me.\nI am not objecting to the\nfact that I was denied entry\nin spite of there being no\napparent reason to do so,\nevery night club has and\nshould have the right to\nrefuse admission. I do,\nhowever, object to being\nspat on and insulted in the\nmanner which I have just\ndescribed. I see no reason\nwhy people like myself or\nindeed any reader of this\nnewspaper should be\nhumiliated in this way for\nno apparent reason, so I would ask and advise all\nthe students of Imperial\nCollege not to visit this\nnight club..the same or\nworse things may happen\nto them.\nYours sincerely,\nAlastair Seymour\nElec Eng 1.\nParty Political\nFELIX\nDear Sir,\nI write to express my anger\nand disappointment at the\nway in which under your\neditorship the Newspaper of ICU has degraded into a Party Political publication. I do not object to your\nreporting current political\nevents which affect\nstudents, but feel strongly\nthat the coverage given to,\nfor example, the recent\nAUT strike has been\nexcessive and biased, and I believe, judging by your\neditorial remarks, tainted\nby your own politics.\nThis in itself would not\nbe a complaint if you had\ndeclared your intentions in\nthe election manifesto last\nyear. Instead, you promise e to relieve us from the\nboredom of last year's Friday 24 January FELIX\n\n"

During his 20\nminutes talk Mgr. Kent\ncondemned the use of\nnuclear weapons in\nde terrance, claiming that\nthe present government's defence policies could be\nbest described as suicide.\nMgr. Kent said that the\nworld has never been in a better position to reduce\narms levels on all sides\nand, with the aid of modern\nspy satellites, to ensure\nthat all agreements are\nupheld. He said that the\nrecent arms talks in Geneva show that the Russians are\nmore willing then ever to\nfinalize such agreements.\nWhen asked about\nPresident Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative\n( Star Wars'), Mgr. Kent was\nfast to air his views that it\nwas a waste of time and\nmoney, saying that no such system could be 100%\neffective against all types of\nnuclear weapons. He\nreiterated the opinion that\nthe money spent on Star\nWars could be better spent\non technical research more\ndirectly relevant to society.\nMgr. Kent was highly\ncritical of Jane's Defense\nWeekly who had published\na report claiming that the\nGreen ham Common Peace\ncamp had been infiltrated\nby Russian agents.

Among the\ndifficulties listed by Steve\nNorton, the Chairman of\nTizard Hall Committee, are\nthe daily closure of the\nexisting kitchen between\n8.30am and 4.30pm, and\nthe lack of warning given to\nresidents regarding areas\nto be closed off. Students\nhave complained about the\nremoval of games machines\nto an area where they\ninterrupt viewers in the TV Room, and the general\ndisturbance caused by\nworkmen in the early\nmorning. Mr Norton claims\nthat the building work is\nbehind schedule, and is\nconcerned that the\ndisturbances will eventually\nrun in to the summer term,\nwhen students require quiet\nfor exam revision.\nGreen\nResponse\nIn their 'response to the\nGreen Paper' College authorities state that they\nexpect any cuts in funds\nfor universities to affect IC\nless than the average, in\nview of the fact that\nImperial has more than\nonce expanded to meet the\nGovernment's demands for\nproduction of more\nqualified scientists,\nengineers and\ntechnologists. Imperial's' acknowledged position as\nan outstanding research\ncentre' should also protect\nit to some extent despite\nthe overall cut of 10% for\nthe country's university\nsystem envisaged in the\nGreen Paper.

    "content": "o The AUT\nStrike\nWednesday saw the AUT strike, in protest at the\nfalling funds for higher\neducation. This affects us,\nthe students, as well as the\nstaff. They have their\ngripes\u2014and you should know what they are\u2014but\nwe too have more. Next\nyear Sir Keith plans to\nincrease grants by 2%\nwhilst inflation is 7%.\nFurthermore we will not be\nable to claim housing\nbenefit over the Christmas and Easter vacations nor\nwill we be able to claim\nSocial Security over the\nsummer. This represents a drastic cut in our financing-of about a quarter if you\nclaim housing benefit (ie\nrent a private place to live)-obviously very severe in\nany case. Already most of\nus are very poor. This drop\nin funding will severely bias\nthe opportunity for higher\neducation towards those\nwith more of their own\nmoney. Why do they do\nthis? There are 2 reason (i) these people vote tory, and\n(ii) it seems likely they are\ntrying to force industry to\nsupport higher education.\nVery good idea, you may\nsay. but if industry pays\nthen how many art courses do you think will survive?\nRogue's Gallery\nIn the education cuts last\nyear, Salford suffered the\nworst of all. They found\nalternative funds from\nindustry alright, but now\nthey're strongly biased\ntowards Science and\nTechnology. Why is it so\nmuch harder for science students than engineers to\nget sponsorships from\nindustry? Because their\ncourses are less vocational\nand they are liable not to\nend up working for their\nsponsors. Clearly, industry\nisn't going to waste money\non courses that don't make\nmoney. The reason why\nthey don't make money is\nbecause they have no\ndirect power to influence\nthe lives of masses of\npeople; if you design a more efficient machine that\noffers ever more luxury,\npeople-being ultimately\nlazy-will buy it. Science and Technology is the\nbasis of your whole society.\nBut this doesn't mean it's the only thing worth\nstudying, money should\nhave nothing to do with\neducation. The freedom of\nopportunity for a wide\nvariety of courses for\neveryone willing and\nintellectually able to do\nshould be defended as a political right. It is highly\nregrettable that the word\n'politics' should every be\nmentioned in an\neducational context, but\nthis is no ordinary\nsituation. You may be\nunder the blissful delusion\nthat the Government has\nless money to spend and\nthat we must all work\ntogether to pull through the\n'World Economic Recession' as a nation. This is rubbish, our country is\ngetting richer all the time\ncontinually the amount of\nmoney available for the\nGovernment to invest is\nincreasing. It just seems less because it is biased\ninto a smaller and smaller\nsection of society, business\nand companies, people\nwho work hard to make\nmore money out of money\nthe rest of us don't get to\nsee it! This is part of the\nmeaning of the word\n'conservatism'. They spend it on helping people to set\nup their own companies and take it from those who have no jobs, biasing the\nmoney continuously\ntowards those who already\nhave it. If you support the\npoint of view that this is\nunfair and should be\nresisted, then you (and I) should support the AUT. You may ask 'but how\ndoes their day of action\naffect the government?'\nThe answer to this is\nsimple. It gets publicity,\nwhich is liable to lose votes\nfor them, and that is all\nthey're worried about.\nPete Klemperer\nRCSAAO\nStudent Houses\nMuch concern has been\nvoiced over the sometimes appalling state of repair of\nEvelyn Gardens, not least\nin FELIX. This seems to\nhave drifted towards\ncomplacency perhaps\npartly due to a reassuring\nprofile of Pete Hallworth\nManaging Surveyor( Residences). This man\nwas portrayed as a genial,\nconscientious administrator\nand little attention in the\narticle was give to Evelyn\nGardens with most\ncriticisms pre-emp t iv ely glossed-over with the\npromise of a grandiose\nschemes for the student\nhouses.\nHowever, all is not rosy-much of the 'vital repair\nwork' seems to be\nconcerned with the external\nappearence of the houses( well, how many members\nof the general public do\n\\ you know that see the\n! inside of a student\nresidence? Few\nimprovements were made\ninside the houses and\nthose which were often\npoor and slapdash. For\nexample, in Bernard Sun ley eggshell paint was used in\na bathroom which duly\ncracked due to the steam.\nOne of the biggest\nproblems with the\ncontractual labour is that it\nis not systematically\nchecked by a College representative or\nadministrator and even if\ncomplaints are made to the\ncontractors, the workmen\nare moved on from site to\nsite, under College direction so few shoddy jobs are made good. This\nlast point assumed that\nadministrative powers-that-be will actually deal with\ncomplaints from wardens:-sadly this rarely seems to\nbe true-examples of this\nLaissez-Faire attitude are\nlegion. For example\ndefective water heaters in\nBernard Sun ley House have\nnot been repaired or\nreplaced and there is also\nonly one functional shower,\nbetween over one hundred\nresidents, with hot water-all\nthe rest are leaky,\nunfinished or have very\nerratic hot water supplies-all these defects have been\nreported by wardens to\nPeter Hallworth.\nInstructions have been\ngiven that Wardens are to\nreport workmen that lack\nsecurity passes-this comes as age at relief since\nwindow locks are in such a poor state of repair that\nany paint-splattered man\ncould infiltrate a work site under the guise of a repair\nman and help himself to\nthe students' goodies, and\nstudent mail since only two\nEvelyn Gardens Houses possess locks on the\npigeon holes. Several large\nthefts have occured from\nhouses and while they may\nbe entirely due to doors\nbeing left open by busy\nworkmen and not bogus\nlabourers the situation\nmust be improved and\naction taken.\nPerhaps one of the\narguments against an\nintensive programme of\ninternal re-furbish ment s is\npurely one of cost. Whilst\nthis is valid, the\norganisation of works is\nsuch that contractual\nlabour is employed, indeed\nat the time of writing Willis\nJackson is still in the hands\nof the contractors. At least\na term overdue.\nAll in all, residents are\ngetting a very raw deal\nfrom an admins t ration which cannot be bothered\nto repair houses\nadequately, which does not\ncheck the finished work\nand usually fails to have\nbad work rectified. All you\nhave to do is to look\naround Evelyn Gardens and\ncompare external and\ninternal conditions to see\nwhere the College Residence Adminstrations\nreal interests lie.\nIs it any wonder that\nwhen you come for your\ninterview at IC you only\never see Halls of\nResidence? Mike Stone\n6 Friday 24 January FELIX\n\n"

Who am I to corrupt the\nminds of the innocent with\nmy tales of the want on behaviour of the immoral few. Luckily this seizure never lasts very long... I very quickly remember why it is so important. Bitching is almost as good as food and men! So, here we go folks..but\nremember, you mustn't try\nany of this at home. Firstly, here is a story\nthat illustrates what I 've\nalways as said - you can't seduce a drunken man! A well known chemist tried to\nhave her wicked way with a certain sporty\nmathematician... in the\nmiddle of a party... while he\nwas drunk. Needless to say\nall she got out of him was a pathetic droop and profuse\napologies. Men! Field Marshall Roger P reece has a lot to answer for in this respect. What a shock it was to hear him\nadvertising the Field Cup( consisting of lots of\nboorish young men running around Beit Quad, destroying it as well and as\nquickly as they can, and\nkilling off their brain cells,\nwith lots of lovely ethanol).\nSurely this is not the kind\nof 'action' that the girls of\nImperial College want to\nsee! The following day all\nthe pretty ones will be\nabsolutely useless\n(including Golden Boy P reece himself). Some people have no\nconsideration. Ben' mini vamp'S idle was out cold in the Physics Wave guide last Friday\nafternoon... again alcohol was to blame( oh, the\nhorrors of the evil drink).\nHe, of course, remembers nothing of this, neither\ndoes he remember anything about the\npersonage who was placed on top of him (but then he\ndid seem a little\nunresponsive at the time).\nFormer super wimp J Martin\nTaylor seems to have been\nlooking rather trendy of\nlate. This may (or may not)\nhave something to do with\nthe fact that he seems to\nhave been missing from\nboth his department and the FELIX office preferring\nthe home comforts of\nWeeks Hall (residence -coincidentally, of course of Sunny 'ain'tI loud' Bains. Rumour has it that\nthey will be trying out\ntogether for the new TV show 'Dreary and Make noise.' Lastly, a seafaring tale\nabout Jolly Roger, captain of the Hol be in House booze cruise, and his trip\nto France. Three men\nended up having to hold\nhim down after too much of\nthe ferry's fire water caused him to throw a fit. Luckily no plank walking was called for, but as far as I can see he's still none too\npopular among the\nshipmates.

However hopes of a win\nwere quickly dashed when\nBrunei turned up with a full\nteam. Handicapped by the\nabsence of 7 players and\nthe presence of Martin\nMorris, IC made a good start winning the A and B teams first games, helped\nby good scores from P Stewart and G Wong. The C Team tried their\nbest not to em baras s Brunei too much as they\nslid gallantly to a three-nil\ndefeat with a distinguished\nrear guard action by R Ingram.\nIn the second of their\ngames the B Team were\nheavily beaten and were\nsaved from a similar fate by\na good performance by N Brigham in their final game.\nAs IC have no women team (I wonder why?) they\nwere now 6-0 down. The A team however prevented a complete whitewash in the\nlast game when Chris W heed on managed to nose\nus in front.\nAt the end of the match\nour star player B Kwok\nhonoured us with his\npresence by turning up two\nhours late.

    "content": "capital ideas\n'Lite is just a boil on the big toe of\nthe Universe' as my old mate Igor\nNedovitch, sports correspondent on\nthe Valdivostock Gazzette and\nAdvertiser, once said to me over a bottle of anti-freeze. Always a man\nwith a sense of perspective and an\nalcohol problem, I think Igor (or\nNeddy as he was known to the lads\nat the Marshall Bulganin memorial\ntractor plant social club and pigeon\ncircle) would have summed up his\nphilosophy of life in the following\nmanner. It doesn't matter if you live\nunder a ruthless psychopathic\ndictatorship as long as you've got at\nleast one pleasure in life so sit back,\nrelax and have another G and T( Glycol and Tonic). What a guy, pity\nhe forgot Andropov was a Moscow\nDynamo fan when he wrote up their\n3-0 hammering by Red Star Omsk. I still get the odd letter from out of\nthe Gulag though.\nWell as I sit here and write this I just hope that the head of MI5 isnt\nheavily into jazz funk (not to mention\nthe fact that life is too wonderful a thing to waste time getting deeply\nphilosophical over and that if the\nsystem's screwing you, then you're a bit of a wimp if you don't try and\nfuck the system).\nI really didn't know where to start\nthis week (as you may have guessed)\ntill I noticed that tonight at Chelsea\nTown Hall sees the only London\nappearance of Robert Anton Wilson.\nWho? you may well say. Well back in\n1976 there were published three\nbooks called the ilium in at us trilogy\nwhich became cult bestsellers. They\nare the definitive be-all-ami-end-all\nof the conspiracy paranoia genre,\nJinking CIA, freemasons, UFQ's, the\nKennedy as s as i nation, the Mafia Mid\nthe death ot er among\nothers in a wac king sci-fi fantasy.\nWell the a fore mentioned Mr Wilson\nwas one of the authors, and ft is his\nIlluminates Rap that he presents\nalongside New York rock poet John\nGiorno this evening. If you've ever\nhad the >\n>\nsi*e tor.sp:- ding\nto the reviews this wi U tickle your\nfunny bone, bend your mind and chill\nyour marrow at the same time.\nThe other man on the bill, John\nGiorno, is also worth a mention.\nEven if you think poetry is a bit\nnam by this man is worth a look.\nDelivering some outrageous material\nto the accompaniment of a 'post\npunk' b;h t out\nof even some of the most vt trie fic of\nthe currently trendy ranting poets, in\naddition to his appearances at\nChelsea Town Hall he is also on at\nthe fC A Theatre this Sunday and at\nthe Waterman* Arts Centre,\nBrentford on Tuesday next week.\nGiorno also features on an album out\ncurrently 'Diamond In The Mouth Of\nA Corpse' which includes\nCoil/Cabs/Sonic Youth, and on\n'You're the Guy I want to Snare My\nMoney With' which also includes\nLaurie Anderson.\nAnother source of current\ninspiration is the Andy Kershaw show\non late night Radio One on\nThursdays. I recently bought the\nVise to the Occasion' mini album\nfrom current favourites The Unholy\nTrinity, which is the first time in\nyears I 've really felt like buying\n* anything I 've heard first on Radio\nOne. The Unholy Trinity formed out\nof the remains of the Sid Presley\nExperience and play heavy rock and\nroil which seems to be somewhere\nbetween Cream and the Sex Pistols\n(this record should be in the Hatdane\nlibrary by now). Next I come to a recent John Peel discovery. Half\nMao, Half Biscuit did one of the\nfastest ever repeat sessions on that\nprogram. Any attempt at description\nof their album 'Back in the DHSS' is\ndoomed to failure. This a masterpiece of alternative h this is a scorching social\ncommentary, this a group I doesn't like Nery's Hughes...\nMan. Half Biscuit are the only group\nI know who would introduce a song\nwith the line Jesus Christ, Come On\nDown!', and I quite frankly creased\nup at their rendition of Time Flys By\n(when I'm the driver of a train)'. And\nthere is good news, Half Man Half\nBiscuit are doing two gigs (their\n'only ever London gigs') at the Bull\nand Gate, Kentish Town on Tuesday\n4th and Wednesday 5th February.\nThe Bull and Gate is 50 yards from\nKentish Town tube and the cost is\n\u00a33. The gig starts at 7.30pm. Talking of records brings me on to\nrecord shops\u2014somewhere I seem to\nspend a lot of time. If you only ever\nshop in Our Price and the Virgin\nMegastore then your musical tastes\nare doomed to be restricted by\ncommercialism. There are in London\na vast selection shops catering for\nall possible tastes and if you buy\nrecords you're wasting your time if\nyen don't browse a few of the more\noff beat ones sometime. Many sell\nsecondhand records and here you\nmay well find cheap bargains in good\ncondition or records otherwise\nunavailable. H is important to inspect\nsecondhand records before you buy\nand the more reputable places will\ninsist you do this to avoid\ncomplaints, certainly none should\n, if a record looks dubious,.\neven a tiny flaw, try asking to hear it\nplayed and if in doubt leave it. If you\ndo buy records which have a cet a in amount of dirt (as opposed to\nscratches) on you can try getting\nthem cleaned professionally. Unilet\nin Bute Street, near South Ken\nstation, will do this at 30pa record.\nThe results can be quite good,\nalthough miracles can't be worked.\nBack to buying records. One place\nyou must check out is Hotting Hilt\nRecord and Tape Exchange who have\nseveral shops in the area, the best is\nin Notting Hilt Gate near the tube\nstation and there is another just\naround the corner in Permbridge\nRoad. If you are desperate to dispose\nof an old Wham! album or two they\nalso buy, but the price won't be very\ngood (even for Wham!) although you\nmight get more in terms of part\nexchange.\nThe Notting Hill area is very well\nprovided for in terms of records,\nespecially less commercial music\nThe doyen of the independent record\nlabels, Rough Trade, have their shop\n(the record company is elsewhere\nthese days) in Talbot Road, just off\nthe Portabello Read. They special se in all independant labels, not just\ntheir own and also have a wide\nselection of fanzines and general\nrecord associated 'gu bb in s'. Just the\nother side of the Portabello Road in\nBlenheim Crescent is Plastic Passion\nwho seem to be one of the best\nspecialist second-hand stores in\nLondon. Be warned they know their\nstuff so you are unlikely to get many\nsuper cheap o bargains, but if you are\nlooking for somewhere to find that\nlast obscure Stranglers single to\ncomplete your collection or a deleted\nFrank Zappa album, this is the place.\nIf you are just looking for a cheap\nbargain, then instead of going along\nto the rather diss appointing Tower\nRecords, you might try Cut Price\nRecords above Jean Machine, High\nStreet Ken who actually seem to\nhave quite a good selection of\nbargains sometimes\nRecord collecting seems to be the\nsort of casual bobby that can develop\ninto an obsession, so be warned. I know of peep le rushing round\nsearching for albums so rare they\nweren't even recorded. The American\n(?) group the Residents recorded an\nalbum called Hot Available' which in\ntypical style they did not release\n(you think I'm joking). Well this\nweek 1\n1\n1 try and finish writing this\nbefore I get tired and start s lagging people off. In the words of that great\nAlbanian mountain cyclist Eugene\nZhog 'running over Iguanas really\nchokes np your wheels*.\nFELIX Friday 24 January 15\n\n"

    "content": "Keep The Cat Free\nIC Union is supporting FELIX\nEditor Hugh Southey in an\neffort to di sua de College\nadministration from\nimplementing plans to move the\nFELIX office. Mr Southey\npresented a paper detailing\nproblems associated with the\nproposed move at a meeting\nwith College Secretary John\nSmith and Union President Carl\nBurgess last Friday. A motion\nexpressing support for Mr\nSouthey's response to the\nCollege authorities was passed\nwithout objection at Monday's meeting of IC Union Council.\nMr Burgess was first informed\nof the plans for a FELIX move in\na meeting with Mr Smith and\nthe Rector two weeks ago. Mr Smith intends to give the\nBiology Department control of\nthe present FELIX Office and the Beit Hall TV Lounge. In a letter to Mr Burgess three days\nafter the meeting Mr Smith said\nthat College was planning to\nrefurbish the derelict kitchen\narea behind the Lounge to\nprovide new offices for FELIX,\nand an additional double room\nand a new TV Lounge for Beit\nHall. Before meeting Mr Burgess and Mr Southey on\nFriday, Mr Smith admitted that\nHugh Southey and J Martin Taylor\nthere was in suffice nt space available for all these needs.\nMr Southey's paper listed\nseveral major difficulties\nassociated with the move of the\nFELIX office. Significant\nstruct u al alterations would be\nneeded to the north side of Beit\nQuad in order to move and\nhouse the larger and more\ndelicate pieces of FELIX equipment. In addition there\nwould be a great deal of work\nrequired in order to make the\nderelict area suitable for the\nproduction of FELIX. Mr Southey also stressed that the\nposition of the FELIX office was of prime importance since\nstudent involvement was 'the\nLondon Student\nAttacked\nA motion which would have\nclosed London Student, the\nLondon wide newspaper for\nstudents, was defeated by only\ntwo votes at the meeting of the\nUniversity of London General Union Council on Tuesday. IC\nUnion buys 250 copies of\nLondon Student which are\ndistributed free from outside the\nFELIX Office.\nThe delegation from the\nLondon School of Economics, who proposed the motion,\ncomplained that an issue last\nterm headlined ' School for\nDrugs' gave the false\nimpression that LSE had a major drugs problem and that\nhard and soft drugs were freely\navailable. They said that since\nthe publication of the article,\nLSE had received several visits\nby the Drugs Squad. The LSE Delegation wanted a front page\nright-of-reply, and felt that if\nthis was not forthcoming UL U should withhold funds from the\npaper until the Editor, Miss\nJoanne To ch, either resigned or\nfinished her term of office.\nMiss To ch had offered L SEa space for reply but reserved the\nright to decide where to print it.\nShe also pointed out that the\npaper was for students at\nLondon' s Polytechnics and Further Education Colleges and that it was 'elitist' for UL U to\nattempt to force its policy onto\nthe paper. During the meeting\nthe LSE delegation were\nthreatened with expulsion for\nunruly behaviour. At one point\nthe chairperson, Duane Pass man, walked out.\nOf the ICU delegation eight\nvoted against the LSE motion\nand one abstained. After the\nmeeting Miss Joanne To ch said\nthat although she resented the\nallegations made by LSE about\nher professionalism made by\nLSE she was still prepared to\nprint a reply to ' School for\nDrugs' in the next issue.\nAlarmed about the move\nlife blood of a student\nnewspaper'. He felt that to move\nthe office to such a remote\nposition would be to the\nunavoidable detriment of FELIX and everyone in College. A further problem was that the\narea available could not be\nutilised so as to provide\nadequate office space.\nMr Southey's paper suggested\nthat it would be more sensible\nfor the Biology Department to\nmake use of the kitchen areas\nfor the office space which they\nrequired. Mr Smith was sympathetic towards Mr Southey's comments, but felt\nthat, if Biology took over the\nkitchen area, they might at a future date attempt to gain\ncontrol of more of the north\nside of Beith Quad. He agreed\nthat there would be sign if icc ant problems if a move of the FELIX office were attempted, and said\nthat he would look into the\ncosts involved in greater detail.\nHe added that he was prepared\nto put resources into the\ndevelopment of the west\nstaircase of the Union Building.\nWhen Council met on\nMonday there was some support for a move of the FELIX office although Mr Southey and FELIX Business Manager J Martin Taylor confirmed the\ninadequacies of the schemes proposed. Deputy President\nDave Kingston adhered to the\nview that to move the office\nwould strengthen the Union's position by securing control of\nthe whole of the north side of\nthe Union Building. Civil\nEngineering De pRep Victor\nFreeney argued that it was u necessary to move the FELIX office and that the kitchen areas\nwould be more sensibly used as\noffices for the Biology\nDepartment. He did not feel that\nhaving full Union control of one side of the Quad would prevent\nBiology from trying to takover\nUnion rooms in future.\nMr Burgess and Mr Southey will be meeting the College Secretary later today to discuss the matter further.\nFree!

There was a fine, not so long ago, when\nPeter Wright was admired by\nen jy \u2022 select group of rightwing patriots. A former senior\nofficial of M15 and close f rie no of Chapman Pincher, he left\nthis country for self-imposed\nexile in Australia, comp laming to friends that there were ' too-many blacks' in this country.\nJust the sort of man you'd expect any decent and right-minded liberal thinker to shun\nand avoid. And yet, and yet, he\nhas suddenly become a hero to\nlarge sections of the Left\nbecause of the book he's writing about MI5, an organisation he thinks is infested\nwith either Commie agents or\ndangerous liberals (I shouldn't think it has too many blacks).\nIt's a funny old world when\nvillains become heroes.\nEver since I first revealed Mr\nWright's book I 've been\nattacked by the caring Left,\nwith such accusations as:\n' Which side of the barricades\nare you on ?' (The other side\nfrom Mr Wright tends to be my\nPeter Wright: Write on.\nstock defensive reply). When\nthe Cabinet Secretary, Sir\nRobert Armstrong, tried to\nstop the book in Australia, the\ndefence counsel rubbished oi y article, even though he knew it\nto be true (he later apologised\nto me).

Heinemann has already asked for two\nadjournments in Australia\nwhile it prepares its legal case.\nThere's a worry that perhaps it\nhas chosen the wrong court in\nwhich to fight the Government's action, cent ring round\nwhether Mr Wright has broken\nhis MI5 contract by revealing\nits secrets.\nPeering over the barricade\nnervously, I do hope the book\nis published, if only because the\nGovernment is so anxious to\nstop it.

Be controversial,\nbut fair and get the other\nhalf of the story then, as\nbefore, you'll get my vote\nand support.\nYours faithfully,\nJohn Martin.\nBorn Again...\nDear Hugh I thought that this week's centre pages on the faces\nof Christianity were very\ninteresting. The opening\nlines expressed some common criticisms of\nChristianity that are usually\nvoiced by non-religious\npeople. The article clearly\nshowed there are many\ntypes of Christians, but I should like to say that there\nare many types of non religious people as well,\nand not all are as\nantagonistic towards\nChristians as the opening comments suggest.\nCertainly, there are\npeople who often attack\nChristians, trying to show their creed as a fraud, and sc rut in ising the Bible to try\nand discredit it. As an\nalternative such people\nusually offer science and logic, but I would venture\nto suggest that such people\nare more narrow-minded\nthan Christians. There are\nfew things which cannot be\nexplained logically but\nsuch people are, in my\nopinion, taking current\nscientific thought as\ngospel, and see Christianity\nas a threat to their own religion. These are the\npeople who treat lecture\nnotes as infallible\ndocuments.\nAlso, there are cynical\nsc ep tics who seem unable\nto believe in anything,\npossibly because they do not believe in themselves.\nSuch people are often\ndepressed, and attack\nreligion because they are\njealous of the happiness\nand contentment that\nreligious people have, and they are the most insecure.\nHowever, there are non religious people who are\nnot dismissive about\nreligion. I am always\ninterested in what religious\npeople believe, not as a joke or a curiosity, but\nbecause I think that there\nisn't one true and right way to live your life, and that by\nlistening to everyone\naround you, you'll end up\nmoving in approximately\nthe right direction. A Buddist said on television\nthat most people see life as\na long and narrow road,\nfrom which any deviation is\nwrong, but that he saw it as\na circle, with many possible\nways of reaching the\ncentre. Although I'm not a Buddist, I remember\nthinking how much I agreed with that part of\nwhat he said.\nRichard G Fincher\nChem 1\nPorn Again...\nDear Sir First, I apologise to those\nwho found it illiterate and 'non-sens ical' next time I shall tone down my article\nto avoid inflaming the\nFELIX typists and so hopefully their fingers will\nnot slip so much. Back to the replies:\nAs a point of information\nnone of our films portray\nviolence, and especially not\nrape.\nThe question of morals\nreappears-l think we shall\nhave to agree to differ as\nneither of us is immoral yet\nwe always reach different\nconclusions. I still believe\nwatching this event for 2\nhours a year, can no way\ndominate our behaviour for\nthe other 8758.\nIt was said that ' Hon Porn...degrades and humiliates men and women, portraying them as\nobjects to be used and abused'. This is a very low\nopinion of mankind-if either\nparty don't want sex, then\nthat's where they use the\nword 'No'.\nYet again, the critics try\nto ridicule and humiliate\nsupporters of the event. I'd like to turn Mr Harman's point around-l was not\ntrying to portray opponents as 'self-righteous purists',\nbut rather condemn the\nportrait of supporters as\ndirty perverts. Respect our opinion as we respect\nyours.\nLet's take a different\nview, supposing Hon Porn's Night was banned, what\nwill it achieve? Will the\nsexist, chauvinist attitudes\nat IC disappear? Or even\ndiminish? I think not,\ninfrequent pornography is\nnot the problem.\nAlways our critics want\nto ban the event. This is a negative attitude, changing nothing. If they want to see\nsexism at IC eradicated, try\npositive solutions, getting\nto the root of the problem.\nI'm sure a lot of you will\nsay 'fine words, where's the\nbeef?'. Last year R SMU made a point of holding all\nparties first with one or two\nfemale colleges. At some parties the women outnumbered the men. This year, R SMU has initiated a Ladies Sports team for\nthose who want to play for\ntheir C CU. Both these\ndecisions are aimed at\nremoving the sexual\npressure resulting from IC's poor ratio, and encouraging social\nintercourse from a base of\nequality.\nFinally, Mr P reece asked 'why R SMU has to place\nsuch importance on this\nevent'. We don't but we do\nbelieve people have the\nright to chose if they want\nto see it or not.\n/ remain yours etc\nDavid Pearce\nIf's Free/\nStU OEM J TRAVEL \u00a9\n(ft\ne0t \u2022ml\nULU Travel, Imperial College,\nSherfield Building,\nPrince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7.

    "content": "a Having only just taken over\nthe job I have still to get\nfully into the swing of the\nrecord buying program.\nHowever I thought I'd take\nthis opportunity to pick out\nsome of the less\nmainstream records I have\nbought recently One of my\npersonal interests is blues\nand I nope to add at least a few new blues records to\nthe collection I'm no\na ff ici on a do and even if I was I would hesitate to\nbore you with an in depth\nhistory of every single Deaf\nLemon Brickface et al. But\nat the same time the\ninfluence of the great\noriginal blues players on modern popular music,\nespecially rock, can't be\nover estimated. Artists like\nFreddie King invented\nmany of the licks and riffs\ncribbed by modern rock\nguitarists. And groups like\nthe Rolling Stones might\nhave been nowhere without\nMuddy Waters, while Dire\nStraits Mega guitar-hero\nMark knopfler cites the\noriginal slide players as a strong influence on his\nstyle of playing.\nBB King is the man they\nsometimes call the 'King of\nthe Blues Guitar' and is\ncertainly one of the better\nknown and more\ncommercially successful bluesmen. His album 'Live\nat the Regal' is often listed\nas a classic and is among recent library additions.\nKing claims he can't sing\nand play at the same time,\nan almost open\ncontradiction to this\nfaultless playing. His music\nis characterised by a soulful 'talking guitar' style\nA review of some recent additions to the Haldane record library, from Mark Cot tle, Haldane Record Buyer. If you want to hear more\nrocking blues then HoundDog Taylor and Elmore James are worth a listen.\nAnd I can't finish without\nmentioning a personal\nfavourite of mine Lightin'\nHopkin's who featured in\nthe BBC2 blues special last\nyear, and some of who's best material is included on\nvolume 12 of the Sonet\nlabel's 'Legacy of the blues'\nseries.\nFinaly bastions of the\ncurrent alternative scene\n'Here and Now' and Roy\nHarper are both playing live\nat present. For 'Here and\nNow' it is sadly their\nfarewell tour. Formed from\nthe remnants of the hippy\ngroup Gong, their music took on a quite different\nand surprisingly\ncommercial sound re men is cent at times of\nsuch diverse influences as\nthe Police in terms of\nrhythms and Pink Floyd in\nterms of floating,\natmospheric guitar and\nsynth. Their last album\n'Theatre' is well worth\nlistening to and should be\navailable once I get around\nto dropping it off to the\nlibrarian.\nRoy Harper is one of\nanachronisms of the music\nworld, and the space here\nis not nearly sufficient to\nsum him up. Harper will be\nknow to most people\nthrough his association\nwith Led Zepplin (eg 'Hats\noff to Roy Led' Zep3) and\nhis friendship with Jimmy Page who plays on his\nalbum Jug ul a. But Roy Harper is at his best as a live entertainer playing his\nown individualistic brand of\nfolk guitar to a small\naudience, often playing\npubs and charity or free\nfestivals. Harper appears to\nhave scant regard to\ncommercial consideration\nand hence much of his\nmaterial is very difficult to\nfind. But hopefully I can dig up enough to keep the\ndedicated bunch of Harper\nfans out there, who travel\nmiles to see the man play\nat the oddest times and\nplaces, happy. 'Jugula'\nshould already have been\nadded to the tape\ncollection and 'Stormcock',\n'Folkjokeopus' and 'Return\nof the Sophisticated\nBeggar' should be around in\nrecord soon.\nThe tape collection is\nwoeful in com parson to\nthat for records and one of\nmy major priorities is\nincreasing it. However\nbecause of the enormity of\nthe task this will be the\nwork of several years. It is,\nincidentally, surprising that\ndespite the fact that the\ntape collection is lacking,\nthe vast majority of\nrequests are for records.\nThe legacy of the early\npsychedelic bands is\napparent all over the place,\nnot least in terms of those\nstill playing. The Deviants\nare an outfit literally stuffed\nfull of ageing famous\nhippies who still\noccasionally come together\nto play some punchy R'n' B. Main members Mick Farren\nand Larry Wallis (both ex-Pink Fairies and Wallis also\noriginal guitarist for\nMotorhead) are joined by\nex MC5 guitarist Wayne Kramer on their live album\n' Human Garbage' which is\na recording of their 1984\nreunion at Dingwalls. The\nrecording manages to\ncompensates for some, but\nunfortunately not all, of\nDingwalls rather poor\nsound and is an excellent\ncompilation.\nI hope that at some time\nthis year I 'll buy something\nto interest most people.\nThe records I have\nmentioned are just odd\npreferences of my own. But\nplease remember the\nfamous quote about\npleasing all the people all\nthe time.\n. Most of us know something\nabout John Lennon. We\nknow that he was one of\ntwo leading members of the\nBeatles, we know he was\nrather controversial in his\nwords and actions both\nduring and after the\nBeatles, and we know he\nwas involved with, and then\nmarried, a Japanese woman called Yoko Ono. Lennon. a documentary/ play/ musical by Bob Eaton, tries to fill\nthe gaps in our knowledge\nby using John's own words,\nthe words of his friends,\nand the lyrics of his songs.\nThe direction by Clare\nVanables was quite\nextraordinary, in the sense\nthat while the cast of nine\ntook several parts each( except for those who\nplayed Lennon), shared\nparts, and generally tried as\nhard as they could to\nconfuse the audience, the\nwhole thing turned out to\nbe quite credible, and even\ncomprehensible.\nThe set was also unusual.\nAlison Chitty was faced\nwith the problem that the\nmusical instruments\nneeded for John Lennon's songs could not be moved\nat all during the show. Even\nso, she managed to design\na stunning (and very\nclever) back wall which\nchanged spectacularly as\nnecessary.\nJohn Lennon is played\nby both Mark McGann and\nJonathan Barlow. Perhaps\nthe only fault in their\ninterpretations of the\nyounger and older Lennon was the slight lack of\noverlap in character\ndevelopment. One minute\nwe see John young and\nfiery, and the next minute,\nolder and cooler. Otherwise\ntheir likeness to him, for\none who had never met him\nat least, was quite startling.\nMr McGann' s voice\nespecially was uncannily\nlike Lennon's own. Other notable\nperformances were given\nby Martyn Ellis and Mia Soteriou who played Paul\nMcCartney and Yoko Ono respectively. Though physically totally different\nfrom the original (except\nfor his hair) Mr Ellis\nmanaged to create Paul\njust as we all know and\nlove him, using his face,\nand to a lesser extent his\nvoice. Ms Soteriou, while\naddressing her audience\nusing one of Yoko's speeches from after\nLennon's death, managed\nto make Yoko seem more\nsympathetic than many\npeople had thought Yoko to be at the time!\nFor anyone who is or was\ninterested in the 'Fab Four'\ngoing to see Lennon at the\nAstoria theatre will be a real treat the music, the\nmyth and the memories.\n8 Friday 24 Jan\nBOOKS\nWith the works of Albert\nCamus the question is not\nwhether to take the books\nat face value, but whether\nthey have a face value at\nall. He was one of the\ngreatest French writers of\nthis century; versatile, hard\nhitting and observant, he\nwas not only a man of\nwords. Camus was once a professional footballer and\nedited a French\nunderground new paper\nduring the 2nd World War.\nIn The Plague Camus writes about an Algerian\nport suffering an epidemic\nof bubonic plague, viewed\nthrough the eyes of a local\ndoctor. The town is sealed\noff by sentries and the\npeople left to die, escape rs being shot, and subtle\ncomparisons are made with\noccupied France. The\nchronicle of increasing\ndeaths - several hundred a day - decreasing food,\nterror and despair crea tres an at mos p her similar to a Salem witch hunt, and for\nthe story alone the book is\nfascinating.\nCollections of his short\nstories such as Youthful\nWritings are especially\nbrilliant - each tiny fable\nencapsulating an argument\nor point of view on life, the\nuniverse or anything.\nPhilosophy, death, art,\nreligion emotions and\nsociety all come under the\nscrutiny of this Nobel prize\nwinner.\nVarious of his books published by Penguin\ninclude Youthful Writings\nand The Plague together\nwith The Outsider and The!\nFall, both of which stab at\nthe hypo c racy of the\nFrench Bourgeois. These should be available from\nany large bookshop.

    "content": "As the internal Services\nCommittee Chairman I am\noften asked the following\nquestions:\ni) Although it is\nunnecessary for the union\nbar to restore its position\nas the most used bar in\ncollege it is evident that it\nmust compete successfully\nwith Southside Bar in order\nto ensure that it is both a financially viable enterprise\nand a service used by a wide cross section of the\nstudents population.\nii) The major factor\nunderpinning the success of Southside( figures from\nlast year show that\nSouthside's takings are\nalmost double the Union Bar's takings) is the better\nfacilities which it enjoys by\nvirtue of its situation. It has\na spacious bar with space to seat a reasonably large\nnumber of customers in\nsome degree of comfort. It\nhas the majority of the halls\nof residence situated\naround it.\niii) To ensure (i) in the face\nof (ii) the union will be\nrequired to make a large\ncapital investment in its\nbar.\niv) The timing of c will\nundoubtedly be affected by\nthe fact that although the\nunion is at present\nfinancially responsible for\nthe union bar, it is not the\nlicence holder. The licence\nwill remain in the Sherfieild\nbuilding until after the end\nof the current academic year.\n2 What kind of alterations\nshould be make to the bar?\nFirstly, it would not be\nsensible to seek to turn the\nunion bar itself into some kind of 'mini southside'.\nAlthough its share of the\nmarket has decreased in\nrecent years the bar has\nalways made a profit with\nthat one room alone. There\nis quite simply not enough room to accomodate large\nnumbers of people who\nwish to sit down with\ngroups of friends to enjoy a quiet social drink. In any\ncase there is no doubt in\nmy mind that even if we\nwere to install better\nfurnishings there would still\nbe elements from the\nC CU/ Rugby Club bar nite set who would deem it\nnecessary to vomit on them\nsimply because they would\nset this as a 'Tradition'.\nWe do, however, have the\npotential to create a 'lounge bar' atmosphere in\nthe room which currently\nhouses the union Snack Bar. In the evenings this\nroom is, at present,\nunderused. If we could install better furniture here\nand spend some money improving the appearance\nInternal Services\nof the room we would have\nan area suited to the more\ncasual bar user. It has the\nspace to accommodate a reasonably large number of\npeople and it already has a food outlet which could,\ngiven suffice nt demand, serve snacks and coffee to\nthose who appreciate that\ndrinking ad nausea m is not\nthe last word in social\nintercourse. There would\nalso exist the possibility of\nholding cabaret evenings\nalong the lines of the\nexcellent but sadly under\npublicised comedy evenings that were\norganised by IC Ents at the\nbeginning of last term.\nTelevision is already on its\nway.\n3 When Can This\nImprovement Programme\nStart?\nThe glib answer to this is\n'when we have the money',\nbut in addition it would be\nreckless for the union to\ndive into such a major\nprogramme immediately\nafter taking over the bar.\nTime must clearly be taken\nsorting out the\nadministrative implications\nof the takeover. A logical\ntime to start is when the\nunion takes over the\nlicence. This gives us a much freer hand in what\nwe intend to do (would the\ncollege engage in\nprogramme of blocking\ntactics to black a move that\nwould clearly be designed\nto take money away from\ntheir own outlets?). It also\ngives us time firstly to plan\nthe changes and secondly to prove to a potential\ninvestor that the bar is\ncapable of making a profit\nwhen run by the union.\nThis means that we have\nto work with the bar as it is\nfor some months, during a period which is traditional y quiet and thus have to\nencourage traditional users\nof the bar to support it.\n4Does it not seem a little\nparadoxical that in order to\nchange the face of the bar\nwe seem to be encouraging\nthe traditional 'bar drinking'\nelements?\nYes it does. However it is\na logical move in so far as\nwe need to make money\nduring this crucial period\nso we must use the bar to\nits best affect and it is\ndesigned as a hard drinking\nbar. Over and above this\ndisgracefully capitalistic\nattitude I would contend\nthat due to the chaos of the\nlast term the bar has\ndiscouraged many people\nwho joined the college this\nyear, we may never win\nthem back but I would say\nto anyone who feels this\nway, please go and take\nanother look, the bar is\nvisibly improving and even\nas it is it can still provide a pleasant setting for the\ncasual drinker. Another thing to point out is that\nboth the union and the bar\nmanager both seek to curb\nthe intimidating nature of\nsome of the acts performed\nunder the influence of\nalcohol in the name of\nhaving a bit of a laugh with\nthe boys.\nIn particular, the union\ncan in no way condone any\nkind of sexist abuse of\nfemale customers. This sort\nof behaviour has occurred in the past and it is of the\nutmost importance that any\nrecurrence of this sort of\nbehaviour is reported to the\nunion so that the offenders\ncan be dealt with.\n5Why did internal services\ncommittee give approval to\nthe employment of\nmembers of Links 22 and\nchaps in preference to\nother students?\nIt didn't, and I personally\nwould oppose any such move. The meeting of 13\nJanuary was attended by\nMoore Lyttle, the union bar\nmanager at my invitation.\nHe was not a member of\nthe committee and as such it would be improper for\nthe committee to make any\nkind of policy dictating the\nmanner in which he should\nemploy bar staff. In any\ncase, Mr Lyttle made no\nsuch suggestion and would\nnot support such a move-you can ask him if you like,\n(that's more than FELIX\ndid). Mr Lyttle did however,\npoint out that there were\nseveral students already\nengaged to work as casual\nstaff who happen to be\nmembers of the\norganisations in question.\nHe suggested that rather\nthan giving these people a free hand in the nights that\nthey work, that some of\nthem be asked on a specific night in order that\nthere would be a point of\ncontact for other members\nof the club in the union as\nwell as Southside( the\nSouthside bar manager is a member of all three 'tie\nclubs'). It was simply a move to encourage one\ngroup of people to support\nthe union of which they are\nor have been members by\nusing a bar around which\nmany of their official\nfunctions are based\n6 To employ any member\nof staff for any reason\nother than their ability to\nperform the function\nrequired of bar staff is not\nonly unacceptably\ndiscriminatory it is no way\nto run a business\nIt would have been nice if\nthe FELIX staff members\nconcerned had bothered to\nask eigth er myself or the\nbar manager about the\nissues in question before\nprinting the rather\nmisleading article 'Bar staff\nFELIX17.1.86) especially\nat a time when it is of\nparamount importance that\nFELIX and the union pull\ntogether to stem the\nrelentless onslaught of the\nBiology department. We wouldn't want to end up\nwith the union office and\nthe lounge moved into the\nbar cell ers and a FELIX\noffice half way up the\nQueens tower.\nAlan Rose\nInternal Services Committee\nChairman 85/86\n7\nFELIX Friday 24 January 7\n\n"
