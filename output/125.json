    "content": "2 FELIX\nLORD BRIDGES\nADDRESS\nThe theme chosen by Lord Bridges\nfor his Co-s Be rac ration Day Address was\na survey of the qualities which he\nconsidered counted most in the lives of\nnan and women who use their brains.\nThe first quality was intense\nenthusiasm for ones work - the beginning\nof wisdom of the highest virtue. Secondly, o a me intellectual honesty, and\nhare Lord Bridges o or rel late d the art is t and the scientific man. Further,\nthis honesty applies with equal force\nto high administrative work. The\nthird quality is the ability to handle\npeople, a question both of sympathy\nand understanding, but trained and disciplined to an unusual degree; it is\nthe type of qualities found in a Minister.\nLord Bridges next considered physical qualities, for example, having a \u2022thick skin, and the ability to sleep,\nbut considered that there were Important to a lesser degree.\nFinally, there is the question of\na good conscience, by which he meant\na reasonably obedient and well trained\nconscience, enabling one to admit ones\nmistakes, and then help to forget about\nthem.\nSummarizing, Lord Bridges considered\nthe following qualities to matter-enthusiasm, inter lect u al honesty, and\nsympathy with people, which can be per-sued and disciplined to a point at which\nit reaches a very acute understanding\nof the thoughts and feelings of those\nwith whom one has to deal.\nLord Bridges attributed the success\nof most distinguished men to their\ndeveloping these fine qualities, after\nthe age when most men have ceased to\ndo so.\nFinally, although the forces of\nmass opinion and mass entertainment\nare tending to make it more difficult\nfor young people to look hard into\ntheir own \"rf wu and develop those qualities outlined above, it would be better\nfor the future of learning and industry\nif more people oo ul d do so.\nGENERAL STUDIES\nS/M/ LE AND\nMETAPHOR\nFor his talk on '519010 and Metaphor*, Patric Dickinson began by asking his audience what was meant by a \"red herring: was it afl as e trial, or was it caught?\nThis led on to the problem of what\n'red* means. Blood is red, but in the Middle Ages it was called blue,\nred and brown on different occasions:\nto some people a red admiral is a butt-er fly, to a politician it has another\nsignificance. Such varying associations of a word are inevitable since\nwords are only a form of communication,\nlimited in scope, while people's imagination is visual and limitless.\nSimiles and metaphors are basic\nto human communication as a means of\ncomparison: their use in poetry is to\nenable the poet to pack the ma r\\ mum\namount of material in, and not just to\nbe obscure. Much is lost when a poem\nis analysed - \"we murder to dissect\",\nsaid Wordsworth - for each person has\na single response: the better the\npoem, the better the responses, but\nthey will vary a great deal.\nMost similes belong to the pre-machine age - \"My love is like a red\nred rose\", \"holy smoke\", \"tight as a tick\": would a girl take it as a oom-pli ment to be told \"my love is like a piece of pre-stressed concrete\"?\nSince poetry is to o on vey emotions\nand thoughts, the material used must\nbe appropriate to such ideas, on any\nlevel which the author requires.\nIn Victorian days, the basis of\npoetry was essentially rom or ce,e pi tomis ed by the flowers, the open fields\nand the sky: consider the scene set\nby Keats, which would be nothing without the use of the simile.\n\"Let us go then, you and I, With the evening spread out against the\nsky\nLike a patient ether is ed on a table.\"\nHONEY0 The second mascot to visit I.C. this\nterm was removed from Westfield College\non Friday, October 24th, by four Guildsmen. Looking suitably dressed for the\nyoung ladies of the establishment, but\nlacking only a bunch of flowers, two of\nthe party entered \"The Bey\", where the\npenguin was kept, just before 3 p.m. After 25 harrowing, nerve-racking\nminutes waiting for the oo a st to dear\nthey emerged at a brisk pace, carrying\nthe body between them. Jumping into\nthe waiting oar they were whisked away\nwithout being seen.\nContrary to the reports in a certain news-sheet the raid took place\nduring a public lecture at the oo lle ge, which started two hours later; neither\ndid they lurk around the main entrance,\nbut entered openly.\nB. N.T. INTERNATIONAL\nEVENING\nChop-sticks and sheepskins, Arabia\ndelicacies and Canadian Gold,a Hula\nHoop and a Tuju mask were among the\narticles displayed on the National\ntables at the international Evening.\nThis was organised on Hallow'een by the\nInternational Relations Club.\nBert Barney, a Canadian, Ming Leung,\na Chinese, Said Tarha, an Arab and Tern\nMolnai a Hungarian formed a Brains Trust\nand gave interesting answers to stimulating questions from the audience.\nDanny Kaye's film \"Assignment Children \" introduced a specialised section\nof the United Nations, TJNICEF. The work\nof the U.N. waa thoroughly and generally\no over ed by Mr. Terry Lawson of the C. EW.C.a devoted worker for the U.N. in this\ncountry, who had been a member of the secretariat during the Hun -arian crises. His\nserious talk was punctuated with personal\nanecdotes which brought our attention to\nthe importance of personal contact in the\nfield of multilateral diplomacy. No formal\nquestions were asked but Mr. Lawson later\nspent a busy hour discussing various\nquestions with some of the students.\nThe \"International Open Sandwiohea*\nwh i oh are fast becoming a feature of\nthese evenings disappeared rapidly, as\ndid the wine, wh i oh was of a higher\nstandard than previously.\nThe evening was more serious than\nformerly and the proportion of foreign\nstudents was not ioe ally higher.\nThe committee of the International\nRelations Club would like to thank the\nChinese and Arab Societies and the individual Canadians and Africans and everyone\nelse who helped to make the Evening so\nsuccessful.\nAM.R.

    "content": "FELIX 5\nLETTERS BEYOND A JOKE\nDear Sir,\nX fear that the common habit of\ntaking objects, of no intrinsic value,\nas souvenirs is becoming out of hand.\nThe idea is spreading, so that ash trays\nglasses, decorations, eto. o an be removed with a dear o ono ien ce if the\nword 'souvenir' is mentioned. These\nobjects can often be quite expensive\nto replace; in the eyes of the taker,\nhowever, it's all good 'sport',\nThe stage has been reached when\nthe more souvenirs one has in one1s room, the 'better' fellow one is considered to be. At the moment, any object wh i oha student would like is validly his if he has the ingenuity to\nremove it without being o aught. The lowest level has now been\nreached. At a ii r ty on Friday 17th. Oot. in the Garden Hostel, a lady's white,leather handbag was removed from\none of the rooms. The theft of the bag\ncontaining a watch etc. represents a serious loe s to the owner.\nTaking things from pubs and London Transport may appear to be unnoticeable in such large organisations, how-ever, the theft of property worth about\n\u00a320 from a fellow-student is not.\nI normally feel proud of I.C. when I bring guests here. On this occasion I felt thoroughly ashamed to be\nassociated with it. Yours sincerely\nB. Weaving (Phys. P.G.) GRIEVANCE\nDear Sir,\nfor tonight we'll merry\nmerry be, tomorrow we'll be sober.\" I am all in favour of an evening spent '\n' out on the beer ' - and appreciate\nmore than most the value of fresher's dinners. Is it, however, necessary to\nbawl obscene language in the quadrangle\nafter the bar o loses, when the offenders\nare virtually in mixed company? How ashamed would these seemingly ill-bred\nah outer s be if they were to discover\nthat their fathers or mothers were\nwatching and listening from, say, a hostel window. How would they like, as\nhostel o leaner s have to, to clean a bathroom in wh i oh someone had vomit-ted en the shower and in the bath?\nUntil the vast majority learn to\ntake their drink as do gentlemen( or\nge back to tha gutter where they have\nearns from), the College will remain unlike part of a University.\nYours faithfully,\nJohn Bramley.\nIMPERIAL EXPANSION\nDear Sir,\nAt the recent R.C.S. union meeting\na motion was narrowly rejected which\nproposed a more towards the secession\nof the R.C.S. union from the I.C. union.\nHowever I feel that such a proposal\nshould not be summarily dismissed.\nThe Imperial College Union is expanding at a rate such that it will\nshortly be composed of over 3,000\nmembers. It is inevitable that as\nsn institution is enlarged, the position of the individual must decline.\nThe sports clubs, too, are becoming too large and unwieldy and equally\ngood, if not better, results would be\nobtained by the constituent college\nclubs.\nLooking to the future, much has\nbeen spoken and written regarding the\nestablishment of Kensinrrton University,\nbringing other colleges into federation\nwith our own. They are more likely\nto feel on a par with us if we exist\na3R.S. M.,C.&G., and R.C.S., than,\nas we now appear, the mammoth Imperial\nCollege.\nI am not proposing the immediate\ndissolution of all ties between the\nI.C., what I am saying is that sooner\nor later we must face the problem of\nour excessive size and complex constitution and that now is the time to .\nstart thinking in anticipation.\nYours faithfully,\nBrian Smalley.\nFLESH OUT OF WATER\nDear Sir,\nMany of your readers will agree\nwith me that D.L.' s article \"Suocess at\nI.C.\" printed in your last issue, considerably lowered the tone of your otherwise excellent newspaper.\nWhilst his appellation of \"goon-like\nbrown b agger\" leaves me unmoved, his jibe\nat the expense of the Underwater swimming Club cannot go un remarked. Like\nmany non-athletic egotists Mr. D.L. directs his sneers at the healthier activities at College. If he oo ul d be persuaded to fore sake the more sordid pleasures of the flesh one Monday evening, I would invite him to judge for himself\nwhy it is that the Union supports\nunderwater swimming at I.C. Yours faithfully,\nNorman Crossland,\nPresident\nUnderwater Club.\nBLEEDING HEARTS\nTo all students who are suffering\nfrom troubles affecting the heart\nor any other reason, now have the\nopportunity to tell your plaintive\nstories to Aunt Hetty of Bedford\nNews who will answer them in her\ncolumn. Identities will not be re-ve a led. NELSON'S COLUMN\nZoologists at I.C. have recently-been engaged in investigating the fascinating spread of the dreaded Oriental\nFlu through the hostel. Before the graphs and statistics so obtained are published for the scientific world - in\n\"The Foul Pest Fancier's Weekly\", it is possible to describe the gist of their\nfindings.\nThe germ spread like boredom\nthrough the Hostel, passing from President to President (indicating its\nchronic nature). Those who came to\noom fort the more attractive Official\nsoon passed it on to others. This was\nparticularly the case with those who\nhave regular and personal contacts with\nI. CW.A. thus insuring its rapid spread along the corridor. By plotting the\ncourse of the malady, some very interesting inferences can be made. It is understood that personal threats made to the\ninvestigators will be ignored unless\naccompanied by cash.\nThe wife of the Mines Entertainment's Officer is, we hear, expecting a baby.\nThe wife of the last year's also had a baby while her husband held\noff ioe. Is this entertainment going to\nbecome a habit?\nQuote from p.17. \"The Sunday Express\"\nNov. 2nd1958 \"Kensington girls by tradition,\nbreeding, training, and temperament\nare as genteel,stodgy and utterly\nrespectable mothers-to-be as can be\nfound in any postal district Oh the\nglobe\".\nN.H.S.

HECTIC WEEK FOB WOMEN AND ARMY0 n Wednesday, Maidenhead Corporation 'won' a gun\" announced the MAIDENHEAD\n| ADVERTISER last week. We need hardly add that this was the work of Imperial\nCollege students, smitten recently by acute cle p to mania. Westfield, Q.M. C. and Bedford have all suffered at the hands of \"trigger happy\" raiders. Westfield's Penguin mascot \"Honeysuckle\" was taken for a ride, as was the Q.M. C. College Shield.\nA group of N.E.C. students, official guardians of \"Honeysuckle\", tried to recapture the penguin on the same day that it was due to be returned, but were succes-fully repulsed by a band of Guildsmen. This incident was followed by a visit from\na few fire engines and police cars, again arriving too late to participate. Fearing further attac Rs, an incongruous escort of vehicles in varying stages of disrepair,\naccompanied \"Honeysuckle\" home.\nShe was borne in mourning into the\nprecincts of Westfield while Guildsmen\ncho roused a sordid version of \"John\nBrown's Body\". The afternoons entertainment terminated with a \"Boomaleka\"\nbut not before the ever-pre3en t, ever-dangerous mob-instinct had reared its ugly head, in trying to force an entry\ninto Vfestfield. How unruly a mob is: knowing not what it wants and dissatisfied with anything it gets.\nAn amusing sequel to this was the\nacquisition' of one Westfield fresher,\nwho got 'carried away' by the whole\naffair and a load of crafty Guildsmen,\n\"back to I.C. We gather she has now\nachieved eternal notoriety for her\ngallant action.\nBy far the most enterprising \" lift\" was that of the Sandhurst Cannon11\n.\nThree visits were made to the R.M.A. Sandhurst and a number of recon na is ances indicated that the cannon was a \"likely\ntake\". The first raid, late on Saturday, October 25th, ended unsuccessfully to a cho rous of police whistles\nand racing engines. Two nights later\nwith the gun carriage already hitched\nto one of the cars, the party was\nsurprised by the brilliant lights of\na police car which immediately gave\nchase,until the students' car was forced\nto stop when the gun carriage (about\n15 cw t) assumed complete control.\nUndeterred by these failures they\nreturned next night, towed the cannon\naway without trouble/, pausing only to\ndecorate the back with a tail lamp and\nnumber plate. Arriving at Maidenhead\nthey left the cannon outside a cemetery\nto await collection later, as its wheels\nwere becoming unser vio able.

UNION MEETING The R.C.3, Union meeting of Thursday, October 30th was held in the Main\nPhysics Theatre - a room denied to the\nUnion before because of the series of\nincidents which marred previous meetings\nThis time, however, President Peter\nKassler, presided over one of the most\norderly and well-behaved assemblies\nin recent years.\nThe election of the \"Queen of\nJezebel\" an honour that finally fell\nto Xandra of Chemistry - was the item\nthat really aroused enthusiasm, while\nthe naming of the thermometer, a blue-pencilled affair, resulted in the choice\nof \"Theta\", bestowed with due ceremony\nafter the meeting, on board Jez in the\nImperial Institute Road.\nA motion \"that this house believes\nthat the R.C.S. Union should secede\nfrom the I.C. Union\" gave an opportunity\nfor wit and ingenuity - the response\nwas not disappointing! Mr. John\nSwingler began the motion in all seriousness, but the riotous opposing plea\nby Mr. Eddie Fersht caused a startling\nchange in the mood of the house.\nThis was in no way damped by the antics\nof Mr. John Forster, who, disguised\nas a soothsayer hinted at dark\n\"behind-the-scenes\" activities by R.C.S. Union Officials.\nIfhen some order had been restored,\nthe motion was defeated by 176 votes to\nl6l it remains to be seen what the\nM.C. Union meeting has to say about\nR.C.S.

This dictum has\nalso been adopted by the College in its present regulations. This is a retrograde step, for it is a sign of\ndiminished ideals, a severe restraint\non University Education.\nFor what purpose do we come to\nCollege? Is it to learn vast quantities of scientific irrelevancies that we\nare unable to comprehend? Is it merely\na seeking after those mystic letters\nB. Sc in the belief that they alone will\nlead us up the path of financial success?\nSurely nothing could be further from the\n'tT-.;th.\nWhat, therefore, is an Education?\nIt is a development of one's mental\npowers, a giving of intellectual training that will enable the recipient to\nfurther the progress of the Human Race.\nA person can have an immense knowledge of scientific facts, a genius\nfor original research, but what good\nis it to the world if be is unable to\nimpart this brilliance to the rest of\nmankind?\nHuman learning and technical\nadvances are eo j nmi nica ted as the written word; they must be written, therefore,\nin a logical and unambiguous manner.\nThis entails a firm grounding and\nadequate knowledge of the English lang-u age, and an ability to express oneself\nclearly and concisely. This grounding\nshould be acquired in our younger days\nat school, and built up through the\nrest of our life. A strong building\ncannot be built on sand; its foundations\nmust be firm. So likewise also our\neducation must be built on a rock, the\nrock of English Grammar.\nIn the words of the College Prospectus, \" evidence of a good general education will be expected \", before\nthe applicant is admitted to Imperial\nCollege. This may at first sight\nappear satisfactory, but what head-master, in his recommendation, is likely to admit that his pupils' general education is lacking?\nThis surely is a very cogent\nreason for requiring an impartial assessment of the applicant's ability to express himself in the Queen's English.\nIn the Union at the beginning of\nthis session I came across some student'\nshopping list. The handwriting was that\nof a ten year old, sons of the spelling\nwas little better: Soesidges, Baked' ,\nBeans, Biskits, Soroepan. What was the\nmental age of this student? Of one fact\nI am oe rta in this student should\nnever have been allowed to enter the\nCollege.\nThe written word is not the a ele necessity; an ability to express oneself clearly by word of mouth is also\nessential. How many students, even when\nthey graduate, are capable of coherent\nspeech? ~5.au many could explain clearly\nand simply the principles of their\n{latest experiment to someone who has\nnot a scientific training? Such a facility is imperative: when a graduate\nenters the industrial world he must be\ncapable of advising nis Company's Directors of the virtues or otherwise\nof his particular problem or project.\nImperial College o on tai ned in 195\u00b01957 79(6 of United Kingdom students\nto only S% from foreign lands. No\ninconvenience is caused to Foreign\nStudents by their having to show\nproficiency, by examination, in English^\nin fact this is essential if they are\nto gain the maximum advantage from\ntheir stay in this College. Tfhy therefore should United Kingdom students not\nbe required to show proof by examination\nTo quote Prof. Perry at his inaugural address on October 2nd.1902 many of you must think that it i a not only a waste of time, but a positiv i sin to read novels and poetry and general literature, to cultivate in any way\nthe imagination, to take an interest in\npainting, or sculpture, or music Are\nyou fond of reading? Do you know how to\nuse books? Can you explain what you\nobserve and know? ... Mere learning is a poor thing, but fondness of reading\nleads to the greatest possible intellectual and emotional faculties\".\nThese are bold words; what Professor\nof today would dare to be so forceful?\nBefore one o an appreciate and gain from\none's reading, a good basic grounding in\nEnglish is es- ent i al. It is my firm belief that a pass in English Language at\nOrdianry Level is the barest minimum\nthat should be tolerated for a University\nstudent: I would go further and say that\nan even higher standard is required for\nscience students. At College we should\nhave compulsory essays to write on scientific subjects at least three times a term, and members of staff should he\nappointed only if they themselves are\nproficient in the jue en's English.\nDo you claim to be educated, or\nare you merely a moronic memo riser and not an understand er of your\ndaily work ?\nJ.K. Taylor.\nATTACK ON Gt.M. C.v ffs\\ JEL CARNIVA)1P' by our Military\nCorrespondent\nTuesday afternoon, and a scout\nparty of two surreptitiously entered\nQueen Mary College via the front door}\nOur heroes, two RCS men with scarves\nhidden round their waists, slowly searched the building. A talk in the bar with\ntwo goon-students, but neither knew\nwhere Mary* was. Intensive searching\neverywhere, including the \"Ladies\" and\nthe Union President's Office (the former\nhas \"Ladies\" on the door) failed to uncover the moth eaten monster, once a leopard but now a stuffed bug-ridden\ncorpse.... and how appropriate for the\ndead, defunct and dandruff ed thing that\nis Q.M' s. union.\nEventually three targets were con-side red: the bust of the founder, the\nparchment charter of incorporation and\nthe college shield, which was selected\nas being the hardest to borrow. It\nis in the T junction of three corridors,\nall of them busy and one under the eyes\nof a hall porter. But, how to remove\nwithout damage?\nA trip to the Physics department\nwhere aP.G., after much haranguing ,\nlent a screwdriver.... oh, miserable\nyouth! Then the unscrewing, interrupted at one stage whilst a party of goon-students walked past, not noticing the\ncrest of their alma mater hanging dizzily at 45\u00b0 whilst the heroic raiders\nperspired profusely. At last it un-screwed. .. and away through the front\ndoor with a polite \"Good night\" to the\nporter (it was now nearly 6 p.m., the\nend of ragging time).\nBut -i. K.C. would not play. All attempts to get them to collect the\nshield from the RCS Union Meeting were\ncountered with. .\"The Rector is informing\nthe police\". So the badge was returned\non Friday morning, its 3-feet length\nback now inscribed \"Presented by RCS\nUnion, October, 1958\" and bearing a tastefully executed RCS crest.\nREFECTORY COMMITTEE The following points arose from a recent meeting:-(1) Last year was a qualified success,\nbut'no trumpets should be blown yet1(2) The small dining room on the third\nfloor will soon be available for\nprivate parties,\n(3) Gross sales thi3 term have risen\nsteeply, causing chronic congestion\nin all the dining Iiallse Possible\nsolutions were discussed, among which\nwas the staggering of lectures - but\nthis appeared to be too complex,\n(4) Cutlery losses from the refectories\nare still high - especially in desert spoons, ( A recent Mooney spot\nraid in the Garden Hostel resulted\nin the recovery of a quantity of\nchina, but little cutlery)\nTrays also are disappearing slowly.\n(5) Kr Garaett apologised for the delay\nin providing a Suggestions Book,\n(6) A proposal that a coffee trolley\nshould go from room to room between\nlectures proved untenable.\n(7) Xraas Closing - from lunch to j ne19 th Dec. until lunchtime 29th Dec.\n\n"

RUGBY\nThe first team have continued\ntheir unbroken record with a143 win\nagainst Rosslyn Park A; A215 win\nagainst Charing Cross Hospital, in which an early load by Charing X provided the requisite needle, and finally\nlast Saturday a490 win against Worthing.\nAfter last Saturday's game the\nhappiest man in the club was Dick\nCoates, the 2nd. team captain. The\nteam resoundingly defeated the Wasps\n4th. XV. No one member can be singled\nout as it was essentially a team effort.\nThe forwards dominated the loose play\nand gained po session of the ball time\nafter time. The backs, taking advantage of this,set up attack after attack,\nswinging the ball smoothly along the 1\nline. Pour tries came from the wing\nthree quarter3, and a further one by a cross-kick from the wing. In short ,\nthe team 'clicked' and the result was\nan exhilarating game both to play in\nand to watch.\nThe junior teams are meeting\nwith mixed success but are suffering\nfrom the weakening caused by injury and\nun availability higher up.\nFENCING Wed. Oct. 28th. The first match of the season was\nagainst Reading University. The final\nresult was a win for Reading by 15 bouts\nto 10. This result, however, belies\nthe actual close nature of the individual bouts.\nThe Sabre win was promising as\nthis is the first time in recent years\nthat we have fielded a sabre team.\nThe results are:-Reading I.C. Foil 11 5\nSabre 4 5\nFoil w L Sabre W L1.J. Nickalls 3 1 1.J. Niokalls 2 1\n2.X.D. Hill132. D.S. Tumer 1 2\n3.D.S. Turner 1 3 3.P. English 2 1\n4.P. English 0 4\nFri. Oct. 30th. This match against Q.H. C. resulted in a fairly easy win for I.C. by 18\nbouts to 7.\nThe details were:\nFOIL I. C.12W L1.J. Niokalls 4 0\n2. I.D. Hill313. D.S. Turner 3 1\n4. P. English t2 SABRE I.C.61.J. Nickalls 2 1\n2. P. English 2 1\n3. D.S. Turner 2 1\nQ.H. C.4Q. M.C.3 HOCKEY The first weeks of the new season\nhave been very fortunate ones for the\nI.C.H. C. They have brought with them\nsuo ces s in several spheres of the clubs\nactivities\nIncreased support has enabled a regular 4th. XI to be fielded on Saturdays, and the rapidity with which the\nplaces in the Sunday mixed XI are fil led surpasses even the most popular of\nlast years matches. This was a long-to-be-remembered fixture with Messrs.\nGuiness and Son. Ltd. (away)\nCompetition for the 1st. XI has\nbecome keener this year and apart from\nthe obvious advantage to the team itself\nthis has also added greatly to the prestige of the 2nd. XI. A recent feather\nin the o ap of the 1st. was their convincing defeat of the U.L.2 nd. by 4\ngoals to 1.\nThe importance of the regular 4 th.\nXI,to the higher teams and the club in\ngeneral, cannot be over stressed and it is very gratifying to see the keenness\nwith which it is being supported. The\npromise of financial assistance from\nthe A.C.C. has made it possible to arrange regular fixtures for this team,\nand it is only to be regretted that\nbecause of lack of club funds they will\nhave to play in white shirts.\nFor the record:- The 1st. XI\nhave won 4, drawn 1, and lost 1, scoring 16 goals and conceding only 5.\nIC WIN GALA\nAt a swimming match at New Cross,\nI.C. were comfortable winners with 68\npts.; Kings were second with 51 pts.,\nand Goldsmiths third with 19 points.\nI.C. won the Medley Relay, and were\nsecond in the Freestyle relay. The\nHarford-Loveman combination again secured firsts in the back and breast re-spec t iv ely, whilst newcomer Shorey made\nan impressive debut in winning the\nbutterfly. These swimmers were ably\nsupported by Wilson, Hills, Alloook,\nWebb and Poet. On the results of the\nGala, two fresher s, Allcock and Wilson\nwere chosen for the University second\nteam.\nThe Polo teams have not been so\nsuccessful. The first team has undertaken an ambitious programme against\nstrong London League opposition, and\nhave so far not quite made the grade.\nThe experience gained from this higher\nclass polo will undoubtedly prove beneficial eventually. The match against\nSouthgate Tl was lost 5-0 and that\nagainst Stoke Newington 9-2, Hart and\nMears scoring for I.C. The second team, consisting mainly\nof fresher s, has lost its first two\nmatches, both by the odd goal, and it appears as if we can expect better\nresults in the future. At Malet st..,\nthey lost 8-7 to L.S.E., with Larson 4\nWilson 2, and Levering scoring. In\ntheir first home match they lost 2-3\nto N.E.C. with Wilson and Lover-ing\nscoring.\nCROSS COUNTRY.\nAt Mitoham on Oct. 22nd. the\nteam result was :- 1st. I.C.(l)116;2 nd. Kings 141; 3rd. L.S. E.282;4th.I.C.(2)301. This was a' mob match'\nto which each college took as many men\nas possible and the great numerical\nstrength of I.C. is shown by the fact\nthat we finished a second team of 10\nmen^hi ch no other college in London\nappears able to do. The first I.C. men home were:- 1. John Collins, 2.\nA Larkum, 5.J. Bernard, 9. A. Brown,\nII. M. Barber, 12. G. Tilly Collins'\ntime for the rather wet 6^ mile course\nwas 34:23.\nSat. 25th. Oct. was the date of\nthe University trials, over 63 miles\nat Hampstead, and I. C.C.C.C. made no.\nmistake in showing the University which\nis the best college, having six men in\nthe first nine. They were:- 2. J. Collins, 4 . D. Briggs, 5. A. Larkum, 7. J. Cleater 8. A. Brown, 9. J F Jaeger.\nLooking at these results we can be reasonably confident about the U.L. Champs,\nIt will be interesting to see whether\nour second team can beat any of the\n'big five' college first teams!\nFour days after the trials,\nBorough Road College were our guests at\nPetersham for a match with I.C.(2) and\nI.C.(3). The team result was:-1. I.C.(2)43 pts.\n2. Bor. Rd. 78 pts.\n3. 1.0.(3) 130 pts.\nThe first I.C. men home were:- I.G. Tilly\n(29:51); 2. J. Bernard (29:54); 4. P. Rayment (30:54). It is interesting to\nsee that all the scoring men in the I.C. third team finished ahead of the last\nscoring Borough Road man.\nLast Saturday the U.L. teams ran\nagainst Cambridge, and I.C. provided 3\nmen in each team. The U.L. first team\nu ffe red a heavy defeat, however the\nU.L. second team were more successful.\nOn the same day a much weakened I.C. team travelled to Hayes where they\nnarrowly lost to Lloyds Bank, but defeated Lensbury A.C.1. Lloyds 42; 2. I.C.49;3. Lensbury 103: I.C. positions were:\n5. G. Tilly, 6. M. Barber, 8.J. Pernard,\n9. P. Rayment, 10. Manson, 11. Clifton,\n1 2. Hammonds.\nSQUASH CLUB\nThe first team have made an\nimpressive start to the season and,\nto date, have maintained a10(35 record.\nThe team shows great promise and\nshould have its most successful season for several years. C.R. Evans, the\nfirst string has been selected for the\nuniversity 1stV and it is also hoped\nthat we will supply two members of the\nUniversity 2nd V. On our two visits to Cambridge\nwe beat Sidney Sussex 3 to 2 on\nOctober 18th and Vueen's4 to 1 on\nNovember 1st. Other successes gained have been over our old rivals U.C. by 4 to 1 and S.O. A.S. by 5 to 0.\nThe second team is still rather\nunsettled and, after starting the season with a good win over R.V. C.1 st V, lost narrowly to U. CH. It is hoped\nthat when the team becomes settled it will prove to have a record comparable\nwith that of the 1st.

Similarly the\nentry of an I.C. team into the U.L. League competition was a new venture and\na worthy one, so far.\nScheduled to play Wesminster College on Wed. 15th. Oct., we were denied\nthe first taste of victory because of\na last-minute hitch.- the opposition\nfailed to turn up! - and we had to wait\nuntil the following Saturday before we\nmade our debut.\nThe team that we were due to\nplay, like ourselves, were newcomers\nto the League, and the match had, on\npaper, all the ingredients of a fine\nstruggle. However, this was not to,bo,\nthe Northern Polytechnic never troubled\nI.C., being unable to equal the speed\nand thrust of our attack, or resolute\nness of our defence. The score at\nhalf-time reflected this with I.C. leading by 27 points to 7 points. In\nthe seo on d half we again proved our\nsuperiority and finally beat a very\ndespondent team by 68 points to i6, to\nregister our first win.\nThe Club's next opponents,\nGoldsmith's College,could have proved a stumbling block, for only the\nprevious week had they been narrowly defeated by D.C., one of last\nyears strongest teams, by the small\nmargin of two points j With a few\nminutes of the first half gone, things\nwere grim, because I.C. were ten\npoints down and had yet to score.\nLuckily though they acc lim at is ed themselves to the gym, and by half\ntime had taken command of the game,\nhaving a lead of ten points. The\nsecond half proved rather robust and\ntempers became heated but despite all\nthis I.C. won by 50 to 28.\nOur next match resulted in a much closer fight, and it was not\nuntil the second half that I.C. got the\nbetter of L.S.E. The final score was\n53 to 22.\nA great percentage of this\nsuo ces s goes to I.C's captain, Jack\nFryer, who has been top scorer in all three matches. His grand total now\nstands at 66 points out of 151\npoints. Mike Barron ( with 32 points)\nand Tony Hird ( with 31 points ) have\nalso played well in attack, while Steve\nRobertson has performed well in defence.\nBefore ending this report, I should like to mention that like all new ventures Basketball is having its teething troubles, but more support\noo nld eliminate these. You do not\nhave to be 7 feet tall,( though it is\na great asset l), and lack of inches is no disadvantage. So why not come along\nto the Gymnasium any Thursday after\nlectures.\n.JUDO\nI.C. Judo dub had a good start\nto their season, when they comfortably\ndefeated the Royal Military College,\nSandhurst, in a home match held on Wednesday, the 22nd of October.\nI.C, won 5 bouts and drew 2 out\nof 7.\nGUILDS FRESHER S DINNERS The series of five Guilds Fresher's Dinners, completed last Friday, constituted something of a marathon for the\norganisers, the last being held in the\naftermath of the Oom mem. Day Ball.\nThe dinners were held department ally this year wh i oh gave an interesting\ndemonstration of departmental character\nfrom the Civils, solid and o on vi vial from com nun al activity at Silwood, to the\nChemical, almost barbaric in their im-maturity, so that even the presence of\nProfessor Dankwerts G.M. could command\nlittle respect.\nThe President repeated metre or less\nthe same speech on all five occasions,\nhis success varying with the relative\nbarbarity of the audiences.\nHumour was usually forthcoming from\none or other of the speakers but the\nPresident made no formal efforts in this\ndirection; no doubt feeling that five\nsuccessive recitations of the unauthorised version of \"Daniel in the Lions Den\"\nin the bar afterwards were sufficient\npenance. Certain regular inhabitants\nof the bar seemed to share this view.\nOn each occasion the Spanner was received with great enthusiasm, proceedings\nbeing closed with the traditional\n\"Boomalaka\".\nAfter the first Friday dinner, the-Spanner was taken on an outing to Bedford College by a group of Civils under\nthe leadership of Jolyon Howe.\nBedford's Social Secretary expressed her desire to dance with the Spanner\nrather than the President, but compromised by dancing with both, after being\ntold that the spanner can't dance.\nLaurels are due to Peter Foster of\nthe Old Centralians for his smooth and\nwitty speaking at the first dinner and\nto the three Freshers who replied to\ntoasts at very short notice.\nCOMING\nFriday 7th Nov.\nPhoto.
