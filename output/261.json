    "content": "2 FELIX8 MAY 1968\nPlease sir For the graduate or prospective graduate thinking of taking up\nteaching as a career, a vast range of opportunities and salaries present\nthemselves. But it is not only this that can make teaching attractive,\nit is as much helping children of ail social backgrounds in the complex process of growing up and making the best of their varying arid\ndeveloping attitudes. Some graduates may prefer to teach sixth\nformer s, others a range of subjects to the less able secondary pupils\nand yet others to \u00bb?ach in primary schools. At all these levels, teaching\nj Ter s more scope than many other careers for graduates to employ\ntheir knowledge of their chosen subjects, sal i hess Is sacs\nmeat to go on studying them,\nPay Scales\nBase salary scales for untrained graduates start at \u00a3900\np.a. and for graduates, with six\nyears training, study or research\nbehind them, at \u00a31060, rising to a maximum of \u00a31600 and \u00a31650 re-spec t iv ely. Good honours graduates, however, may expect to get\n\u00a3120 p.a. more, all the way up the\nscale, plus a \u00a370 allowance if they\nteach in the London area. This\nis not all, for the structure of\ngraded posts and head ships of\ndepartments and schools is an important element in the graduate\nteachers' career prospects. 80\nper cent of men in their late thirties or older, with reasonable\nqualifications, have risen at least\nto the position of head of department and a fifth are headmasters.\nGraded j \u00bbsts carry allowances\nfrom \u00a3125 to \u00a3315, heads of departments from \u00a3210 to \u00a3700 and\ndeputy heads from \u00a3125 to \u00a31055,\ndepending on the size of the\nschool. Headmasters' salaries\nrange, once again, according to\nthe size and age-range of the\nschool, from \u00a31710 in the smallest\nprimary schools to \u00a34110 in the\nlargest comprehensive schools.\nNo additions are applicable to\nheads' salaries, except, where ap-pro pri ate, the \u00a370 London allow-ance. Looking ahead, retirement\nbenefits are also paid in the form\nof an annual allowance and a lump sum, calculated on the\naverage salary for the last three\nyears of service.\nSpecial Schools\nThere are less well known opportunities in special schools for\nhandicapped children (both\nphysically and mentally handicap-ped), and in approved schools.\nTraining is available for teaching\nin these special schools, which\nprovide a satisfying career for the\nright person, with an extra allowance of \u00a3130 a year. Approved\nschools are residential establishments providing academic and\nvocational education for children\nand young people who have been\nsent because they have committed\nan offence or are beyond control\nat home or because they need\ncare or protection. The aim is to\nprepare them to take their place\nagain in society and to cope with\nits responsibilities and strains.\nH.M. Inspectors\nCareers are also available, after\nnecessary experience in some\naspect of education, in H.M. Inspectorate of Schools. InspecCITY OF LEEDS\nAND CARNEGIE COLLEGE\nCARNEGIE SCHOOL OF\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION\nA one year PostGraduate Course for Men APPLICATIONS are invited from\ngraduates who wish to qualify as\nteachers and specialise in Physical\nEducation as well as their degree\nsubject. The course is grant-aided,\nrecognised by the Department of\nEducation and Science, and leads\nto a graduate certificate in education and a diploma in physical\neducation.\nFor prospectus and application\nform apply to The Principal, City\nof Leeds and Carnegie College,\nBeckett Park, Leeds 6\ntors are usually recruited through\npublic advertisement and salaries\nstart at \u00a32390 p.a. rising to \u00a35950\nfor the highest posts. The work\nincludes inspection of schools,\npreparation of pamphlets and lia-sion work between the Department of Education and Science\nand Local Education Authorities.\nEquality of Sexes\nThe L.E.A.'s also offer occupations in administration with\nsalary scales rising from a low of\n\u00a31850 a year for the lowest paid\nborough education officers to\nover \u00a35300 for chief education\nofficers. Other openings exist in\nthe forces, industry, youth work\nand adult educational, research,\neducation journalism and careers\noverseas.\nOne of the advantages for women is that it offers them equal\nopportunities with men. Even\nmarriage need not be a deterrent,\nfor schools are glad of their services as long as they are available\nand will welcome them back if\nthey decide to resume their professional careers.\nTeaching on\nhow to Teach\nOne year P.G. courses of training are provided in universities\nand colleges of education which\nbenefit the teacher by enabling\nhim to practice and experiment\nunder experienced eyes and also\nto pick up an extra \u00a350 a year\nwhen he starts work. A Graduate\nTeacher Training Registry exists\nat 151, Gower St., W.C. I, to process swiftly applications for admissions to these courses.\nFurther details can be found in\na booklet \" Careers in Education\nfor Graduates\" available from\nthe Department of Education and\nScience in Curzon Street, W. l. Banking Today, the term 'banking' means\nmuch more than the process of re-ce i ying and lending money. Banks\nhave many ancillary services, and are\nadding more to their operations each\nyear. They can do almost anything\nfor a customer from keeping his\nvaluables, to helping him make his\nwill, and, supervising his estate When\nhe has died. They assist in foreign\ncurrency transaction, advise in tax\nmatters, and help in the purchase\nand sale of stocks and shares.\nWide Horizons\nAnyone joining one of the main\n'Clearing banks' as they are called,\nhas roughly a fifty per cent chance\nof becoming a manger (and there\nare women managers). As with all\nthe professions, there are exams set\ni by the Institute of Bankers\u2014these\ncover subjects as far apart as geography and economics' to monetary\ntheory and accountancy. It's not too\ndifficult to put all ,,the necessary\nexams behind you in five years.\nObviously a manager must know\nthe whole sphere of banking, and\nmost of the theory he will need to\nknow is contained in the diploma\ncourse,\nManagers have to deal with a cross section of people, face to face,\ngiving them advice or warnings.\nThey have to maintain close contact\nwith the commercial and industrial\ncommunities, both locally and nat-ion ally. They1\nneed a far shrewder\njudgment and a far wider knowledge\nthan most professional men.\nBut hard work is involved. Theory\nand practice are mentally and physically very tiring, and the first few\nyears served as a bank clerk or\ncashier are not always enjoyable.\nBut it's a career with wide horizons\nand high standards.\nGRADUATING IN PHYSICS OR ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING? Careers flourish in this climate Where can I find the right environment to launch my career ? A young man, graduating in physics or\nelectronic engineering can find the answer in E.M.I. Electronics Limited.\nE.M.I, have long been a dynamic force in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of\nmicrowave and photo electronic devices including photomultiplier tubes, camera tubes, and microwave\ntubes as well as solid state devices such as microwave sources and radiation detectors.\nClose integration of all these activities provides exceptional opportunities for career development.\nIf you are taking a physics degree and have a bias'towards physical-chemistry or vacuum technology or in\nelectrical engineering with a leaning towards development work we would like to talk\nto you and show you some of the work we are doing in these areas.\nTo arrange an informal interview please contact:-W.D.

Eng theatre A it was\ndecided to accept the University's offer of an increased London weight in h thus\naverting a strike that the technicians claim would have halted the examinations\nthis year and brought all research work to a stand still. As a result of tli is settlement, te coa ici an snow receive a greater London \u2022weighting than academic staff.\nIn November the PIB report recommended a London allowance of \u00a3125 for the\nnon-industrial civil service. Wlien this was published A3BS, the technicians' Union\nclaimed for the same. '.Che University recognised the justice of this claim, but\nhaving r to money had to apply to the Government for the necessary funds. The\nGovernment eventually gave an unfavourable reply, and the University claimed that\nit could not pay the increase. However, the ASBIS, the new, stronger, Union formed\nfrom the old LSGxJ and ASSET threatened strike action and the University suddenly\nfound that it could pay the increase from its own resources.\nThose working within 4 miles of Charing Cross now receive an extra 565 pa.\nThe Imperial College branch of the Union was foremost in talc ing the strong\nline that achieved the rise. There may well be trouble ahead because of anomalies\nunresolved by the recent settlement in particular TE's and EO's receive no rise\nand those at College Field Stations outside London do not get the rise awarded to\nsimilar people in the same College, but working in London.\nPIRATE J AiLER\nTuesday afternoon; A mini was parked in the Rector's Car Park, halfway across\na lockable boll ard, with a notice in the window \"I am attending lectures at Imperial\nCollege and therefore consider I am entitled to park here.\" S.C. \u2022TEZ Y.1 MS PRIZE AT BRIGHTON\"\nLast Sunday, RCS Motor Club took Jezebel on the Historic Commercial Vehicle\nRun to Brighton. Setting off from Battersea at 6.3O a.m.( such hours do exist, even\non a Sunday) she behaved superbly, the only trouble being that the fuel tap closed\nitself twice en route.\nUnfortunately, the mini tender vehicle of Dick Gentle was not quite so well\nbehaved, and gave UID the ghost. But Jez continued to Brighton regardless.\nIn the Concourse d 'Elegance Jez was awarded 2nd prize, a plaque for pre-1920\nfire engines (Guilds please note - Jez wins prizes) and she then stormed home,\nre vitali sed, in only 3 hours. In honour of Jez' achievement the College flag will fly today.\nBE BLOOD! GENEROUS\nThe last session of blood do ning in the Union building in November enabled\nthe National Blood Transfusion Service to collect 444 pints of blood, in fact\nenough blood for a bath i Blood is still ur.gently needed and it would be a tremendous achievement if this figure were increased at the next session starting on fey 21st. Provided that you lie in con fort with a pretty nurse holding one hand and a cup of tea in the other, there will be no after effects, ex ce ots perhaps, an\nincreasing desire to do it again.\nThere are no qualifications necessary to become a donor, in fact any type of\nbleeder will do, so please don't hesitate in signing up on the notice board in the\nUnion.\nIn spite of this flippancy, it cannot be over stressed how important blood is. It is not uncommon for operations to have to be \u2022postponed because of lack of blood\nfor a necessary transfusion. The doctors in charge of the session have stated\nthat there are no after effects at all and do ning will have no deleterious effect\non examination performance. In fact the sight of all those nurses will probably\nincrease your performance, so please, if you possibly can, give your blood at the\nnext session in the Union. Leslie Webb Botany PG\nNEW BAR :.XTRHISIiINGS\nSouth Side bar is to get 12 new chairs and 5 new tables plus a \u00a3 2 5 0 carpet.\n\u00a3100 of this is to be paid for by the staff as they use the bar.\n\n"

To give some examples, a three ct m ree meal for two, with a bottle of wine and twenty cigarettes, costs about\n10/-, the biggest peach yon can hay costs 2d., and a hotel can cost\n6/- a night. The usual temperature was 80 and our on? day of rail\nin a month was just average.\nMost people head first for\nIstanbul the city half in Europe\nand half in Asia. The main\ntourist sites are St. Sophia, sometimes said to be one of the wonders of the modern world, the\nBlue Mosque which stands out\nwith its six tall minarets, and\nTop' \u2022>'.

The, inner palace contains the treasury where almost\neverything is made of solid gold,\nincluding the washbasins\u2014a change from the usual sanitary\narrangements. The other big attraction is the Grand Bazaar\nwhere you can buy a lot of junk,\nor some real bargains. Care is\nneeded when buying jewellery es-pec i ally. A hallmark is usually\na good guarantee, but once after\nwe refused to buy something\nwithout a hallmark, the shopkeeper offered to find a stamp\nand mark it for us.\nOne of the most enjoyable\nthings is bargaining for what you\nbuy. You may be asked just a little more than the true value, or\nup to five times as much. By\nbargaining in several shops the\ncorrect values can be discovered\nand the longer you spend the\nlower the price usually is. Bargaining can be a real battle of tile\nwits, but always remember to\noffer less than you think a thing\nis worth.\nCOACH TRIPS A journey outside Istanbul into\nAsian Turkey can be very re-warding. Long distance coaches\nare fairly cheap at around 10s. for\n100 miles, and they always hand\nround bottles of water from aa\nice-box at regular intervals, almost a necessity at that heat.

    "content": "8 MAY1968 FELIX 5\nA series in which articles are\ninvited un subjects dear to the\nwriters' hearts.\nPlea\nOnce upon a time, and not so\nvery long ago at that, I met a girl who was cast in the mould of\nAphrodite, had eyes as cool and\nbeautiful as a mountain stream\non a warm spring day, a face as\nwarm and smiling as a harvest\nmoon in the autumn midnight, a mind as still.and as deep as the\nmidsummer twilight\u2014and she\nthought I was sloshed.\nTo remedy this small defect in\nour relationship, I decided to\nwrite her a letter. This, dear\nreader, is where the problem\nstarts! Would you tell her she\nwas a Grecian goddess, as mellow\nyellow as the yellow mellow\nmarshmallow moon and still\nexpect her to take you seriously?\nCould you, leaning heavily on\nyour brash boyish charm, think\nshe would take you as you want\nto be taken? And you, madam,\nignoring innuendos, would you\nmistake love for lust? The problem becomes apparent, HAS\nROMANCE HAD ITS DAY? Bowing to the pressures of the\nSensual Sixties, the notion of\nromance is being slowly torn to\nshreds and tossed piece by glorious piece into the litter basket of\nlife. How otherwise can it be\nwhen the population accepts \" Up\nthe Junction\" as the norm of\nhuman behaviour. This film,\nabove all, shows how the romantic notions of the Chelsea heiress\nare swamped by the gross materialism of her lover and her friends.\nNowadays, a great proportion of\npeople (both male and female)\nsacrifice their virginity on the premarital bed, and I would venture\nto say, not primarily because of\nfrom\nthe heart\nlove but because it is fast becoming the accepted thing to satisfy\nthe basic sexual instincts as early\nin life as possible and then as\noften as posible until the day of\nim potency arrives. All this is\npushing romantic love to the back\nof the stage. You, dear reader,\nprobably scorn these thoughts,\nbut is it really worth throwing up\nall the happiness of traditional\nromance just because you think\nyour friends will laugh themselves\nsilly at you?\nAs students, we are generally\nviewed to be in the forefront of\nthe sexual revolution, but how\nmany of us have, as a by product\nof this revolution, thrown romance out of the door. Don't get\nme wrong friend, I'm not trying\nto preach Victorian morals! By\nall means sleep with your bird or\nblok e of the moment, but let\nwords from the heart be the\nbeckoning red light to promiscuity between the pure white hall\nsheets. Don't shun romance-culture it, and then make love\nall you want. Just don't let sex\n<tease to be partner to romance.\nThat's my message. Campaign\nto bring back, romance into our\neveryday lives and loves. Don't let's get stifled in sterile computer ie sed love. Don't think like a girl who told me the other day\nthat holding hands was \"pu key.\" Don't just make love\u2014make romantic love and be all the happier\nfor it.\nMeanwhile, this girl is still cast\nin the mould of Aphrodite, with\neyes as cool and as beautiful as\nPAUL HEATH K took Fred Smith\nabout 80 years and\n\u00a350O to discover\nthat he wasnt a TIMES reader.\nmyr j Elektra's Beautiful Sons The Hangman's Beau: if ul Daughter (Eleetra E UK258:39 s. lid.) is the third LP to come\nfrom England's very own Incredible String Band. The Observer\nsang its praises; Melody Maker\nraved over it; the Sunday Times\ncalled its songs \" incredible:\nloos d knit poetry, anti urban, pant be' s ric, imaginative, com-plex, using strange harmonies . . .\nconvincing, beautiful, idiosyncratic, yielding more with each\nn lav in s....\" All of which h accurate. Now FELIX joins in\nthe glad tidings although it can\n4b little more than endorse the\nopinions of the' aforementioned\norgans in stating that the LP is\nvery good and a worthy purchase\nwhether your taste be for \" folk \"\nor \" progressive \" music.\nThe tracks, ten in all, are\npenned by either one or other of\nthe Band; the majority coming\nfrom the more obviously creative\nof the two, Robin Williamson,\nhis songs tend to be meandering\nand personal with lines of great\nbeauty; the songs of Mike Heron,\non the other hand, are more direct and forceful, simpler to comprehend and touched with a dry\nhumour. The longest, a ten\nminute opus by Heron, called \" A Very Cellular Song\" embodies\nthe preoccupation of the LP with\nthe mysteries of life, (Mother)\nby\nSpoons\nnature, Christianity; it also shows\nthe initially disconcerting habit of\nthe Incredibles to change tempo\nand ac comp ania ment almost in\nmid-sentence. The ac comp ania ment itself is something of a surprise involving (to name a few\ninstruments) guitar, sitar, whistle,\nhammer dulcimer, pan pipe, oud,\ncha hana i and water harp (this is\na pail of water with a string across\nit). The singing too is curious;\nRobin Williamson lingers over his\nsongs, squeezing four or five notes\ninto a single syllable with ease.\nThe whole effect is unique and\nthe LP is capable of repaying a lot of listening; it's also beautifully packaged.\nTwo other recent issues from\nElektra are \" Good Time Music \"\nand \" Select Elektra,\" both anthologies Off their catalogue. The\nfirst is a mixture of white blues\nand jug band music, and features\nthe Loving Spoonful, Paul Butterfield, Eric Clapton, with the\nPowerhouse (whoever they are),\nalso Al Kooper, and Tim Rose.\nIf you like the white blues, John\nMayall-style scene (I don't), this\nLP is good value for money with\n14 tracks. \"One More Mile\" by Butterfield is good, and their\nversion of \" Spoonful\" is one of\nthe better ones; Clapton performs\nwell on \"Stepping Out;\" the\nSpoonful tracks are rather\nordinary and include \"Almost\nGrown\" and the all-time favourite\n\" Searchin' \" A good piece of\nbackground music, the LP is\n\"Good Time Music\" (EUK\n260).\nThe other album, replete with\nsycophantic sleeve notes by John\nPeel, is more wide ranging, being\n11 \" progressive pop\" tracks.\nStandouts are \"Suzanne\" (Judv\nCollins), lyrically beautiful, well\nsung: \" Morning Glory\" (Tim\nBuckley) a good example of his\nwork; \" She Comes in Colours \"\n(Love), off the da Cppo LP; and\na short version of \" Light My\nFire\" by the demonic Doors,\nomitting the Classic four minute\ninstrumental break of the LP..\nThe Incredible String Band are\nrepresented by \"First Girl I Loved,\" a poor track, and crap\ntracks are * Aries \" by Cosmic\nSounds (what can you expect with\na name like that) and \" Home of\nthe Brave \" (very sick j by Earth\nOpera. In general, though, it is\nanother good anthology, worth\nhearing if you can ignore the bad\nif umber s. Select Elektra (EUK\n261).\nfor ban fitting\non a column\nIf you cruise up the river like\nI did the other weekend, somewhere below the Albert Bridge\nyou'll see the Palace of Westminster. As you go higher up,\nput away your posters of \" I howl\nfor Powell \" and \" Black Enoch \"\nand try to dismiss his ideas on the\nr ft Ce problem as those of a Grand\nNationalist. Look on the other\nside and you'll see a sign which\nsays: \"Thousands ot pounds\nwasted every year. Save ,your\nwaste-paper.\" It was of course\nexplained by the barges full of\nwaste-paper lying beside the\nwharf. Nevertheless, it would\nhave been more appropriate to\nhave finished with \" Don't waste\npaper.\" But the bits of paper\nwill always pour out: bits of unnecessary confetti for somebody's archives.\nMy desk lies perpetually littered with bits of calculations;\nengineering reference books; record sleeves; a pile of letters that\nI must get round to replying to\nsome time; various political tracts\nsuch as the Economist whose\nfacts I usually accept and whose\nconclusions I never do and the\nTribune whose facts I treat with\nscepticism and whose conclusions\nI usually accept; and occasional\nscraps of poetry, called verse by\neveryone else. To do anything,\none has to consume vast quantities of paper. I wanted to find\nout what the Robbins Report\u2014\nthat Government paper on Higher\nEducation\u2014had to say about IC.\n\"I'm a fj raid it's rather large,\"\nsaid the librarian, producing\ntwelve volumes of facts and statistics and evidence.\nTo get people to listen to you,\nyou must be verbose. And sometimes obvious. Like that Yardley\nadvert which says '\"Girls are\ncoming back.\" So before every\nCouncil meeting one is regaled\nwith mountains of words. I'm doing my bit, I admit. I hope I shall be brief and to the point.\nBut I doubt that people absorb\nideas\u2014as opposed to facts\u2014without having them hammer ad home\nparagraph by paragraph.\nI even got two complimentary\ncopies of PHOENIX last week.\nWhy two? Last time I got one.\nAre they trying to get rid of it?\nOr am I supposed to read it\ntwice? Perhaps the literary\nqualities of members of IC need\nto be hammered \"nome, copy by\ncopy. Or advert by advert. As\nyou walk through the Union\nfoyer, it would seem from them\nthat, after lectures, the average\nstudent has an hour of political\ndiscussion, an arty film, a night of\norgy, followed by repentance at\nearly morning Hall Communion.\nAnd now it's the mad season\nwhen manifestoes and profiles\npour out. \" Frederick Blockleknocker appeared in a wastepaper basket at the age of three\nyears. After twelve years at\nMuch Wallowing in the Marsh\nPrimary School, he scrambled\nout to Nether Wallop Grammar\nSchool where his nether was walloped 25 times in his first three\nvee ks there. His humour and\nmasochism should make him a good Guilds Vice-President.\"\nThe humour of these things is\nconsistent\u2014it's bad. My favourite profile is of the guy who\nmaster-minded the campaign of\nBirmingham's new president Ray\nPhillips : \" Three years' hard and\nBINGO\u2014he's in! And you have\nthe utterly depressing sight of Ray\nPhillips keeping his sweating bum\nwarm in the hot seat.\"\nMaybe you consign these manifestoes straight to the bin. I was\ngently surprised to fin ff the ether\nday that all my six election points\nof last year have been acted on,\nThis year I would say \"Don't waste paper.\" But most people\nbelieve what they write. They\njust write too much.\nWho said \"LookwJWs talk-ing\"?\nThe Charge Of The\nLight Brigade\nThere can't be many among us\nwho haven't heard of The Charge\nof the Light Brigade\u2014the one at\nthe Odeon, Leicester Square, of\ncourse.\nLeaving the cinema after the\nperformance there were no vivid\nmemories of flashing swords and\nshining buttons but rather of what\none can only take as nu re realism.\nThe men's boots had just the\nright amount of dust on them and\ntheir rackets were as tat tv as they\nmust have been at the time. The\nincompetence of the officers must\nbe somewhat down hearten it ag to\nall romantics but on reflection\nstrikes a very true note. Even\nthe Light Brigade itself didn't strike me as particularly coura-geo us. The film showed admirably the pointlessness of the fighting in the Crimean war, and the\nstupidity of the tactics employed.\nAs a story the film is worth\nlittle. It is a series of events\nvaguely connected by the lives of\nvarious characters. The reaction\nto the war back at home was virtually unexplored, a rather important omission, I think, as the\nwhole film, to my mind, was\nmeant to be only an accurate\nhistorical account of the events\nsurrounding the Charge, and if\nanything made it memorable, it\nwas the contemporary British\nnewspapers.\nHowever the film was most\nenjoyable and if not quite as\nmemorable as the actual event,\none can hardly blame today's newspapers. Despite' all this it\nis, as they say, \"well worth\nseeing.\"\nCHRIS SLEE\nElections in Britain\n\" Elections in Britain \" by R.L. Leonard is a comprehensive\nreview of the principles and methods of elections in Britain.\nOriginally entitled \" Guide to the\nGeneral Election \" and published\nfirst before the 1964 General Election as an attempt to acquaint\npeople with electoral methods in\nthis country, it has been completely rewritten and expanded\nand gives both details of the\nmechanics of elections and comment upon them backed up by\nstatistics of recent elections.\nIn particular T found the chapters on the organisation ot the\npolitical parties and on opinion\npolls very interesting, with perhaps the passage on selection of\ncandidates (drawn from experience of trying to become adopted)\nthe most lively.\nAll in all the book is a positive\nmine of information for anyone\nwho is likely to be involved in an\nelection, whether as candidate,\ncanvasser or voter. It is published\nby D. Van Norstrand Co. Ltd.\nand costs 12/6d. paperback and\n35s. hardback.\nDAVID COOPER\n\n"

    "content": "4 FELIX8 MAY1968r s BOB PINE\nBob came to Guilds as a Civil Engineer after a year in industry. In his first\nyear he was the scrum half for I.C. Ist XV and played for Guilds in the Sparkes\nCup. For his part in Guilds victory in the Athletics Sports he was awarded Guilds\nSports colours; this year he is the secretary of Guilds Athletics Club.\nAt the end of his first year he was elected year rep. and then captain of I.C. Rugby Club. The club has had a successful season and Bob has worked hard to\nhelp all the teams not just the 1st XV. Bob feels that this has been a good proving\nground for a job as the President of Guilds. It has tested his organisation; the\nRugby Club is the largest club in I.C. and as any such position in sport would do\nit has tested his leadership. He has also had the opportunities to meet and to get\nto know people not just from the constituent colleges but from outside Colleges\nand Universities as well.\nBob has not confined his interests solely to the\nRugby Club but he is on the executive committee\nof A.C.C. and as such has had a say in the general\nand financial organisation of the whole sports\nstructure of I.C. Bob is unashamedly a sportsman in the widest\nsense of the word and although he has not been\nmuch involved in the politics of Guilds and I.C. he does not feel that this would be a drawback to\nhis becoming President of Guilds. He believes\nthat this post is not a political one but rather the\nmouthpiece for the Union which in turn has been\nformed mainly for the material and intellectual\nbenefit of Guildsmen.\nIf jdl33 ted Bob j has several plans for strengthening the union. He hopes to\nestablish a more dynamic initial contact with the first year Guildsmen; this done,\nwould aid the union in years to come. He would also like to increase the range\nof entertainment provided by Guilds by getting Departments to organise new\nevents for themselves and the rest of Guilds. This would also increase the contact\nbetween years within a Department and by organising it on an interdepartmental\ncompetitive basis would increase the Guilds \" spirit.\"\nBob would also like to see the old favourites of Morphy Day, the Field Cup\nand the Swimming Gala re vitali sed. Finally he would continue to push for more\nfinancial support and continue the good work achieved by Guilds in the staff-student relations.\nGUILDS\nDERMOTT CORR\nGuilds Union Meetings are quite well known for their \" sport.\" Guildsmen\nwho have bothered ft> attend them could not have failed to notice a broad Irish voice\nin the midst of the organised disorder. This voice belongs to DERMOTT CORR.\none of this year's Guilds Presidential candidates.\nThis year Dermott has been Guilds rep on I.C. Council, which also involves\nbeing a member of Guilds Exec. From this vantage point he has been able to get\na very clear impression of what the President's job entails. He says it is rather\nlike an iceberg as one only sees about a tenth of it. There is a lot of committee\nwork, representing Guilds on both exclusively student committees and on I.C. ones like the Refectories Committee and Athletic Committees. It is in the field of\nacademic affairs, however, that he feels that the most valuable work can be done.\nThis work involves anything\nfrom arranging coffee machines to\nsuggesting changes in lecture content and examination timing.\nObviously the success of academic\naffairs work depends on a steady\nflow of information from the de-partments. Dermott hopes to be\nable to improve this feedback by\nstrengthening the year rep.\nsystem.\nOne of the more obvious\njobs of the President is a figurehead in all meetings and discussions with the staff, and it is in\nthis field that Dermott is\nstrongest. He has been active in\nGuilds affairs for two years and is\nfairly well known by the Staff and\nknows how to a no roach them.\nMany people might still feel' that anyone who appears to mess around at\nGuilds Union meetings in such an obstreperous way would not be suitable for the\npre:ident i al post. If these sc ep tics had attended an I.C.U. meeting last term they\nwould have seen Dermott proposing a motion in a most eloquent manner. Then\nhe was being serious and was speaking for something that he believed in; although\nthe motion was narrowly defeated he created a very favourable impression even\non those who opposed the motion.\nDermott has both the ideas and the experience to make a good President; he has\nshown himself to act as a leader across the broad spectrum of work that the post\ninvolves. Dermott Corr must be the obvious choice for next year's Guilds\nPresident.\nAnita\nFurniss\nYOU may have seen diverse posters advertising \" Nita,\" who is standing for\npresident of R.C.S. YES! she is a woman YES! she is serious. 'Nita arrived at\nI.C. three years ago and has been in the chemistry department ever since. Next\nyear she is staying on to do an M. Sc. course in analytical Chemistry. She writes\nthe Mackmania column, often to be seen gracing these noble pages. Hence she\nhas inside information on the running of R.C.S. However she has not been a committee member of R.C.S. but feels this an advantage rather than a disadvantage\nbecause she knows how the ordinary member of R.C.S. feels towards the executive.\n'Nita is an experienced organiser and has performed useful service as secretary of\nthe Carnival. She produced the programme for the folk-concert single handed.\nBesides the above she has managed to write I.C. words and folk-club reports for\nFelix.\nWhy does 'Nita want to stand for president??!!\nShe is representative of a new wave of opinion in R.C.S. and it was this group\nwhich persuaded her to stand. The basic thesis of her policies is to encourage\nindividual participation in the Union. Her idea is that it is the members of the\nUnion who are important and not the executive committee and they would do\nwell to remember this. She feels that too many people regard the Union as a prerogative of the few and do not join in its activities because of lack of encourage-ment. 'Nita thinks that the president should rouse people into activity and has\nbeen quoted as sai ying:\" If the mountain won't come to Mohammed, Mohammed\nmust go to the mountain \" (sounds familiar). Her ideas on how to achieve this\nare many and varied. They include departmental parties where people can meet\nand talk to the officers of R.C.S.(\" The present fresher s tea is a fiasco as regards\nfinding out anything about R.C.S.) and interdepartmental activities such as sports\nfixtures, parties and debates. This is to prevent the present isolated nature of\nChemistry and Maths. She hopes to improve the lot of post-graduates especially\nthose who were not undergraduates at I.C. This group tend to get neglected by\nthe Union. She would like to see an enlargement of the entertainments committee\nto about 20 to 30 in an \" Ents. action group.\" This would involve more people\nin Ents and make the organization of social events easier.\nOn the non-Social side 'Nita wants to carry on the good work done by the\nStaff-Student committees and the academic affairs officer. She would like to\npromote staff-student relations by organizing more social functions with the staff.\nShe also supports management studies and would like to see the addition of non-science subjects in more courses.\nDoes she think that being a girl will hinder her in being^president of R.C.S.? On the contrary Anita believes that a girl can do the job as well as a man. In fact\nshe believes that it may encourage girls to come to I.C. and help di spell the image\nof a ruthless male dominated society. The main point about Anita is that she is\nprepared to go and meet members of the Union on a personal basis.\n(P.S. She isn't bad looking either).\nRoger\nWebb\nIn the past, Presidents of R.C.S. have run their campaigns with great fer v our, but after their victories have become recluses hardly meeting anyone outside of the\nGeneral Committee. Rog Webb feels that the strength of R. C.S.U. must lie in the\ncampaign. How does he propose to do this?\nPresident being approachable both before, and more important, after his election\nRog Webb realises this is a difficult task but feels that it can be done by having\ninformal gatherings of the General Committee and year reps. He thinks that at\ncommittee meetings ideas are less forthcoming than at informal gatherings where\npeople tend to air their views with more confidence and conviction. This way he\nbelieves he;will be able to hear the problems of both individuals and whole depart-ment s. In addition he intends to go round the laboratories and libraries talking to\npeople because he knows that many people have problem es and do not talk about\nthem unless directly asked.\nThis sounds rather an ambitious boast by an ignoramus. On Union affairs Rog\nWebb cannot be described as that. This year he has been Secretary of RCS, and\nin this role he has tried to implement several ideas like the rearrangement of\nfresher's dinners and reforming the constitution. On this latter task Rog spent many\nhours demonstrating that he is capable of hard work in the Union cause.\nThe knowledge that he gains from these informal meetings will be put to good\nuse. Rog has a great interest in academic affairs, a subject on which he has\nseveral ideas. These have been set into motion this year and will be pushed forward\nnext year. They will not be allowed to drop because the main advantage of choosing\nRog Webb as President will be continuity in the running of the Union.\nMany people know that Rog intends to get married this year and may doubt\nthat he will have the time to live up to his pledge of being more approachable.\nThis will not be so\u2014as Rog is in Maths he does not have to spend lengthy hours in\nthe labs and so will be able to spend time during the day carrying out his duties.\nRog Webb has all the attributes of a President. He is known by and knows\nmany people, and is fully aware of the requirements of the Presidential office. He\nhas shown the drive and enthusiasm that is necessary for the post. With these\nattributes who can become the President of RCSU but Rog Webb.\n\n"

It was a restless affair with\nthe audience poised to dash out\nthe instant Phillips gave the word.\nRory Redmayne's revolutionary\nmotion was not discussed. Matters that were, included the Dow\nChemicals affair, following Phil\nPainter's letter in the last FELIX\nclaiming censorship of the affair.\nPhillips cleared up the matter to the temporary satisfaction of Painter.

Brian Auger was well\nworth waiting for, and his organ\nplaying together with Julie Driscoll's spectacular singing drew a large audience to the Concert\nHall.

Communism, came along and\nfrightened away nearly all those happy colleges and Universities. But\nthe few who were left were brave and fought the big, bad ogre and\nthrew him out.\nWhen they heard what had happened all the other colleges and\nUniversities crept gingerly back, all, that is, except for Imperial\nCinderella who had by this time decided she could survive on her own\nand obstinately refused to come back. No amount of wooing with\ncheap travel and student concessions by Prince Charming N.U.S. would persuade her. Not that you could blame her. Prince\nCharming had warts all over his face and was so incredibly inefficient\nand became avaricious, wanting 1 /3d, then 2/6d, and then 5/-d. per\nyear per student.\nBut then Prince Charming began to realise about the warts on\nhis face and decided to do something about them. He split his\norganisation into regions and decided it was time he actually did\nsomething for the colleges whom he had attracted.\nThen when the big, bad Department of Education and Science\nthwarted all the Colleges with a Grants Cut, Prince Charming went\nout to fight him. And Imperial Cinderella, being unable to find a Quorum, did not know what to think about the Grants Cut. So she\nasked Prince Charming, and Prince Charming welcomed her help with\nabout a dozen people at the Battle of Trafalgar Square and twenty at\nthe Battle of the Houses of Parliament.\nThe point of all this is that N.U.S. is changing, but is our attitude\nto it? I.C. has always been insular, but I think that in the past we\nhave been right to stay out of N.U.S. We must guard against being isolationists, but on the other hand\nlet us be sure that if we join, and someone is due to bring it up\nnext session, the money invested is worth it.\nMuch good work is at present being done by them. They have\nproduced numerous pamphlets on subjects affecting students, for\ninstance the Rent Act, and are recognised as the voice of students in\nBritain. They will shortly be publishing an important report on\nstudent housing, and are currently investigating and negotiating on\ngrants, length of degree courses and many other subjects which affect\nstudents directly.\nOf course they are still incredibly inefficient. Letters are seldom\nanswered and over half of their income goes on administration, while\ntheir conferences seem to be more a succession of procedural motions\nthan anything else.\nAlthough we will probably be able to get the affiliation fees added\nto the Union Fee there will be other expenses like conference fees.\nI hope that this wi H stimulate people into thinking rationally\nabout the N.U.S. question. Without the red herrings of travel con cte s ions which, as Martin Lack last year showed, are no better whether\nyou belong to N.U.S. or not.\n\" How doI turn my grant cheque into money?

For one thing, other people are going to want\nto pay you money in the future.

    "content": "RUGBY CLUB HITS BELGIUM\nJudging by the difficulty some\nof the party had in awakening at\n9.30 a.m. on Saturday 23 March,\nthe ICWA Formal the night before must have been quite a success. At this early stage the (already)\ncareworn Captain was worried\nabout his team. The original\nparty of 20 had been gradually\nwhittled down to 17 players by\ninjuries and calls made by\nexaminers. As four matches were\nto be played on rather hard\nground this seemed a somewhat\nscanty body of men\u2014in numbers,\nthat is.\nHowever, the 17 were smoothly\naway from Victoria at 11 a.m. and after a bracing boat trip from\nDover to Ostend during which\nDick WiHcox distinguished (or\nwas it extinguished?) himself with\na bottle of Drambuie, and an\nhour-long train journey, we arrived in Brussels at six p.m. We wandered down the Rue\ndu Marche to an abode for the\nweek\u2014the \"Hotel des Touristes\"\n\u2014where \"all the Rugby teams\nstay.\" We were to wander down\nthis street many more times\nduring the weeks as it was the\nvery heart of Brussels* red lamp\ndistrict.\nOn Sunday we were taken to a ground at Kelle where, against a side we took to be the National\nTeam, we won 59-0. Of course\nit wasn't the National team!\nAfter two days of sightseeing\nand other entertainments we met\nthe National Team at 9 p.m., under floodlights. This was the\nfirst game played by IC under\nfloodlights and it seemed to suit\nus well. We won 16-3 against\nreally quite good opposition. John\nKelly was in brilliant form scoring\ntwo great tries, much to the delight of the home crowd and the\nire of the National team.\nThe I.C. party with Meads\nWe enjoyed Tuesday night,\nsome more than others. Messrs\nKelly, Ballard, Harding and\nSmithies arrived for breakfast\nfrom the outside of the building\nin a condition unusual for the\nhour.\nThe high cost of food in Brussels made the financial situation\nrather irksome but in between\n\" evan nig s\" we beat Brussels\nUniversity 34-0. This game was\nplayed on the Thursday at midday and it was the hottest March\nday in Brussels for 135 years. To\ntest our stamina even further our\nhosts had arranged a visit to the\n\"Wieleman's\" Brewery for us\nstraight after the match. After\nan exhausting tour of inspection\nwe were delighted to find that we\ncould drink as much of the Drew\nas we liked\u2014what a challenge!\nFriday morning was spent being\nentertained by our hosts, the\nBelgian R FU on the 28th,29 th and 30th floors of the Martini\nBuilding. Plied with Martinis\nand magnificent views, for an\nhour we lived a James Bond\nexistence where before us had\nbeen Brigitte Bardot, the Spurs\nand IC Rugby Club (in 1962).\nOur last game was on Saturday\nagainst Avia. Despite valiant\nefforts of the Scottish referee we\nwon yet again, on another very\nhard pitch, this time by 27-3.\nWe returned to England, tired\nand broke, on Sunday, celebrating\nDick Willcox's21st on the boat-poor devil!\nOur trophies are to be seen in\n. Southside bar (a pennant) and the\nUnion bar ( a bowl). Those who\nwent on the team were :\nR.J. Pine, J. Lum, M. Dodson,\nJ. Ballard, J. Kelly, P. Cox, A. Duke, R. Willcox, D. Bell, C. Harding, B. Kettle, T. Stephenson, C. Cattell, M. Riley, J. Wild,\nJ. Jackson and J. Smithies.\nBOB PINE\nWONDERBAR KOBENHAVN\nNot to be outdone by the pro-fess ional s, IC footballers left\nLiverpool Street station on 24th March for a taste of European\nfootball, plus a taste of other,\nusually less vigorous continental\npastimes. Twenty-six hours of\ntravelling to Copenhagen were\nahead of them, containing a fair\nshare of incidents, both desirable\nand undesirable but usually concerning \" desire \" of some sort.\nMost of the evening on the boat\nwas spent sampling Danish be-ver ages; later the team demonstrated some British traditions\nand then one R.J. Horlock demonstrated some Ancient British\ntraditions as he went for an evening stroll on deck wearing only a bandage on his left ankle.\nOn arriving in Copenhagen, a pleasant surprise was waiting\u2014\nno accommodation had been ar-ranged. A temporary stay in one\nof the cheap ex j hotels in the centre\nwas sought and found but it\nturned out that most of the guests\nin this hotel were young, heavily-made-up ladies who appeared to\nspend much of their evenings\nstanding on the pavements of the\ncold street outside. However,\nblind eyes were turned to this\npractice except those of R.J. Horlock who was greatly interested in all that went on.\nThe first game was against a team from the Copenhagen AB\nClub (who are Danish champions)\nbut all the players were students\nat Copenhagen University. In a close, hard-fought match IC got\ntwo early goals and led by this\nmargin until the last ten minutes\nwhen AB scored two quick goals\nto tie the match. A good per-form ance, as the match was under\nfloodlights and on an all-weather\npitch, both completely new to the\nIC team. The ground was rather\nloose but on limb-contact very\nhard unfortunately\u2014the players\ncame off minus a few square\ninches of their knee-cap skins,\nall having had quite a few falls\nexcept for R.J. Horlock who,\nperhaps due to the films he saw in\nthe afternoon, managed to keep\nerect throughout the game.\nThe second match: was Against\nanother Copenhagen league side\ncalled Bronshoj, this time in the\nafternoon and on grass. IC. won\n5-3, due more to youthful fitness\nthan to skill, perhaps, as the\nBronshoj team contained some\nvery good players including two\nex-Danish internationals, but they\nwere getting on in years. One of\nthese internationals was against\nIC's inside-right, R.J. Horlock,\nwho had a hard game.\nThe third and final match was\nagain under floodlights and on an\nall-weather pitch, against the\nShoskavad reserve side who are\nin the Danish National League,\nsecond division. This was easily\nlCs best performance; the v played a very fast and clever\ngame and ended up convincing\n5-0 winners. R.J. Horlock had\na very good game but complained\nat being stiff at the finish.\nOn the whole, a very successful\ntour, marred mainly by Danish\ntaxation producing a pint of beer\ncosting ten shillings on average,\nbut educational trips round the\nCarlsberg and Tuborg Breweries\nhelped to reduce this anomaly.\nICWSC\nOn Friday 26th and Saturday\n27th of April, the UX.U Athletics championships took place\nat Motspur Park.\nICWSC fielded a large team\nwhich by sheer strength of num-be rs, won the Imperial Challenge\nCup for the winning ladies team.\nSuccess was mainly due to Ann\nBurrell, our captain, who won the*\nLong Jump, High Jump, and 80\nmetres Hurdles titles to score 18\nof our 49 points, although all\nmembers of the team were successful in gaining points in their\nevents.\nThe team was : \u2014\nAnn Burrell (Capt.), Dorothy\nAtkinson, Thelma Brown, Joyce\nButcher, Lilas Campion, Susan\nLong, Margaret Lumley, Janet\nManneld, Jane Pugh.\nWHAT' SON WEDNESDAY\n8th MAY University of London Quaker\nSociety.

It was a perfect setting for one of the\ngreatest intellectual Empires that s ever held the stage.

Through countless centuries, war has left its\nmark not only on the visual splendour s of the classic era but also\non the traditions of the Greeks.\nIt is not surprising then, that after\ncenturies of Turkish occupation^\nthat the food they eat, the games\nthey play and the clothes they\nwear resemble those of the Turks,\nwhom they hate so much. Indeed their animosity towards the\nTurks is so great that if one\nshould mention that one is contemplating travelling ia, Turkey\nthey visibly quiver. To the\nGreeks they are vagabonds or\ngipsies and nothing is safe in their\nmidst.\nThe cheapest way to reach\nGreece would be to travel by train\non a Brian Hughes Party to\nAthens and take enough food to\nlast for the whole journey. It is a long journey, exactly three days,\nbut although uncomfortable at\ntimes with six to a carriage, this\nis entirely compensated for by the\nun stinting friendship of the many\npeople of different nationalities\nthat one meets. If one travels this\nway on reaching Athens one usually finds oneself migrating towards the Hotel Marion in Plateia\nVathis where for 15 dr s one can\nsleep on the roof and have a hot\nshower.

As regards\nbeaches Greece has plenty to\noffer. The humid island of Corfu\nwith its acres of Cypress trees\nhas miles oL soft sandy beaches\nand shady inlets. The suburbs of\nAthens too have fine beaches, but\nthese are usually expensive and\nalways crowded. The best beaches\nI think to be found on the mainland are near Kavalla in Northern\nGreece, which is one of those rare\nparts which unaccountably he off\nthe tourist map. Kavalla is a town rebuilt from the ravages of\nthe Nazi occupation and its pe o ple, like all Greeks are warm and\nfriendly. They can be seen in\ntheir most charming attitude in\nthe evening as they stroll down\nthe quay side drinking and eating\nas they go. For in Greece television has not yet reared its ugly\nhead.\nThe loveliest place in my mind\nin the whole of Greece is Crete.\nIt is much less arid, it attracts far\nfewer tourists and therefore is less\ncommercialised and has a character all its own.

He\nthen presented us with an endless\nsupply of the local wine and little\ngarnishes like cucumbers, feta, the\ntypical Greek cheese and kebabs\nand watermelon until at about\nthree a.m. more than a little inebriated we returned to the Youth\nHostel. This performance was\nrepeated every night that we were\nthere.\nFar from the\nm adding crowd\nNo journey to Crete would be\ncomplete without making a pilgrimage to Matala in the south of\nthe island. There can be found\nnot only the fascinating Roman\nburial caves but also large numbers of seemingly innocent hashish\nsmokers. Not far from Matala is\na tiny village called Aghia Gallini\nand if you want to spend a quiet\nholiday in a secluded spot with\nthe minimum comforts of life\nthen this is the place for you. It\nII\nwas said by the inhabitants that\nonce people came they never\nwanted to leave, which seemed to\nbe quite accurate, for of the twelve\npeople there at the time, none\nsave myself had been there less\nthan three weeks and there were\ntwo Americans who'd been there\nnearly two years. But I thinK the\nquestion really was not that they\ndid not want to leave, but that\nthey couldn't. For there is only\none bus each day and that leaves\nat 4.30 in the morning and since\nthere is no electricity it is virtually\nimpossible to find out the time.\nIf you db manage to catch the bus\nto Heraklion then you are more\nthan likely to have your spine\nfractured as the bus bumps along\nOn the twisting boulder-strewn\ntrack. Should you eventually\nreach Heraklion you must visit\nthe palace of Knossos where Sir\nArthur Evans spent \u00a3250,000 of\nhis own money in excavating and\nrebuilding the Minoan palaces. If\nKnossos fires your imagination\nthere are many other impressive\nsites to be visited, including\nPhaistsos, Aghia Triada, Gortys\nand Mallia, and it would be worth\npaying a visit to the museum at\nHeraklion to see the reconstructed frescoes and mosaics\nfrom the various palaces.\nGreece then is a place of great\ncontrast; from the dry arid landscapes of Mykonos and the\nCyclades to the lush green valleys\nof Crete and Rhodes. If you\nshould once set foot in Crete you\nw lR never want to leave for if you\nwere to ask me to choose a paradise on earth then it would be\nCrete.\nCHRIS LEWIS\nttc kj feel\" I WE CAN CURE THEM FROM\nAS LITTLE AS \u00a317 PER WEEK\n\u2022 Russia and Eastern Europe\n\u2022 Siberia and Japan\n\u2022 Central Asia and India\n\u2022 Scandinavia and Midnight Sun\n\u2022 Italy, The Balkans and Greece\n9 Turkey and Israel\nQUO VADIS STUDENT TRAVEL\n(Ref. 131 43 DOUGHTY STREET,\nLONDON, W.C.

The first reaction when one finds that another one is to open is that its presence\nis hardly necessary.\nAnd then one finds that the new premises of the Institute of\nContemporary Arts are to be more than just a conventional art gal-le ry, although much of its activity -w L\" v*>e, in a broad sense, that of\nan art gallery; the provision of a place to show works of art. The\nworks of art in question, however, will not be confined to paintings\nand sculpture, though these will not be neglected, but will include\nfilms, television, theatre, dance, poetry and other ait forms which\nlie between or beyond the conventional boundaries.\nThe ICA was founded in 1947 by Sir Herbert Read art\"? Su\nRoland Penrose among others. Its first exhibition was entitled\n\"40,000 Years of Modern Art\" and was designed to show the essential\nsimilarity of prehistoric, archaic.and tribal art and the.avant-garde.\nSoon afterwards, it moved to permanent premises in Dover. Street,\nwhere the first London exhibitions of Dubuffet, Cartier-Bresson aud\nMatter were held.\nNew Home\nIn December 1967 the lease on\nthe Dover Street premises ran.\nout. A part of Carlton HouseTerrace had, with the aid of the\nArts Council, been acquired and\nWhile the exterior of the magnificent John Nash-designed terrace\nwas left unaltered the interior was\nbeing gutted and converted into a gallery, a cinema-cum-theatre,\nworkshop and offices. At the\nsame time, Michael Kustow, who\nhad previously worked on Centre\n42 and had spent four years with\nthe Royal Shakespeare Company\nwhere he organised the Royal\nShakespeare Club, was appointed\ndirector. The new premises are\nshared with four other societies of\nart and design : Society of Industrial Artists and -Designers,\nDesigners and Art Directors\nAssociation, Design and Industries Association and Institute of\nLandscape Artists.\nOpening\nCeremonies\nThe official opening of Nash\nHouse as the property is being\ncalled, was by Jennie Lee,\nMinister of the Arts, on April\n10th, but prior to this two events\nwere held there. One was the\n\" house wart ning\" party with\n2,000 guests, wine, food, fantastic\nMark Boyle light shows, a band\nof African drummers, two beat\ngroups and an experimental\ndancer, and the other un address\nby Buckminster Fuller, in venter of the geodesic dome, designer of\nthe US pavilion at Expo '67 and\nwinner of the Gold Medal of the\nRIBA.\nThe present exhibition, which is\nthe opening one at Nash 1- use,\nis called \" The Obsessive Image,\"\nthe image being man himself. It\nis, when one looks at future plans\nfor the 'centre, almost; a con-'\nv cnt ional exhibition, of painting\nand sculpture executed since\n1960. The choice of theme seems\nto have been inspired, by the need\nto find a sufficiently broad topic\nrelevant to the aims of the ICA,\nand by confining the exhibits,\nexcept for three films and a work\nconsisting of a succession of\ncolour slides, to paintings and\nsculptures which are the oldest\nand best established art forms, it\ndemonstrates that it has not rejected any of the old in search of\nthe new.\nRobbed of the novelty which\nsurrounds, and is one of the attractions of, new art forms, the\nexhibits must stand on their own\nmerits and stand comparison\nwith, for example, the best the\nTate has to offer in its modern\nsection. This they do very welL\nAs may be expected when the\nsubject is such a complex topic as\nman, the exhibits show a wide\nvariety of interpretations. Some,\nsuch as Niki de Saint-Phalle's \"Clarice Again,\" are unashamedly\nfun, others are concerned with\nlove and hate, with suffering and\ngrief, some celebrate man's freedom and others his increasing\nme chan is ation and conformity.\nTo single out any particular\nexhibits would be to prejudice\ntheir evaluation by anyone else.\nHowever, if you can take time off\nfrom revising and can afford the\nprice of 2/6 for members and\n5/- for non-members, \" The Obsessive Image \" is worth a visit as\na fairly comprehensive up-to-the\nminute review of \" conventional\"\npainting and sculptures. The exhibition is open until- 29th May\nand is open Tuesdays to Saturdays from 11 a.m. \u20146 p.m., Sundays 2-6 p.m., closed on Mondays.\n\n"
