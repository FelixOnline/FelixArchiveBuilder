    "content": "COMMENTARY\nA fortnightly review of Union affairs.\nRegular readers of the Council Notioe\nBoard in the Union Lounge will no doubt\nhave read recently a notice concerning\nthe Marxist 3ub Group. The latter ha a, in the past,been a sub-group of the Lit. and Deb. 3oc., but this year the Sooiety\nfinds itself \"embarrassed\" by its relation\nwith the Marxist Sub-Group, and, by strange\noo in aiden ce the International Relations\nClub also feels for the same reason that\nit cannot possibly take the left-wing\n\"theorists\" under its wing.\nIt is therefore proposed that the\nMarxist Sub-Group should become a fully-fledged Society of the I.C. Union after\napproval by the S. C.C. at its next meeting\nHowever, its supporters are forgetting\nthat under Item 10 of the S. C.C. Oonatitution they are bound to obtain a list of\nsignatories in support of the proposed\nClub,and under past S. C.C. Chairmen it has been necessary to submit a list of\nnot less than 25 such persons.\nLet us hope that at the next S. C.C. meeting the members (the Presidents of\nall the I.C. Social Clubs) present will\ndemonstrate that they are not so gullible\nas the members of the Marxist Sub-Group\nwould like to think. Perhaps they will\nremember that apart from being an embarrassment to the Lit. and Deb. Soc., the\nMarxists are also an embarrassment to the\nI.C. Union, and for that reason should\nnot be officially recognised in any way.\nAn unofficial survey was conducted\nat the last meeting of the I.C. Union\nupon the sub jt eot of the number of\nmembers present, and when, after the\nmeeting, the results of the various\ncounters were mean edit was found that\nthe attendance at the Union meeting\nwas 1 9 5 + 1 . Under Item 17 of the\nBye-Laws of the I.C.U. it is stated that\na quorum of a General Meeting of the\nI.C.E. shall consist of 200 Full or Life\nmembers of the Union, and upon this basis\nwe may therefore reason that all the decisions arrived at at the last meeting\nare invalid. Comparing the last Union\nmeeting with the one at this time last\nyear (attendance then was 700) we may ask\nwhat is the reason for this 3ud den lack\nof interest this Session. The answer is two-fold:\n(a) The Union is being lead half-hearted ly from behind rather than from in front.\nThe only policy seems to be to try to discredit Council and to avoid coming to any\ndecision or giving any lead to the Union\nin public. Perhaps the person concerned\nis at last beginning to realise that it is up to Council and not the Union meetings to manage the Union on everyday\nmatters.\n(b) This year the politicians have risen\nto power and we see their effect in the\nresulting chaos surrounding the distribution of the proceeds from the I.C. Charity Carnival, not to mention motions\nabout South Africa.\nIt is not surprising therefore that\nthe I.C. Union meetings are in quo rate and\nthat even the members of Council are so\napathetic that they do not even bother\ntc attend the Union meetings and speak in\nsupport of their own resolutions.\nA PLEA FOR\nACTION\nbu Qandall Peart\nWhat is wrong with lectures in\nthis College? It is generally agreed\nthat lectures at I.C. are not the stimulating influence they should be. Gur\nlectures tend \"to be relics from school\ndays - the scribbling down of oom pref hen sive notes and figures from the\nblackboard (with the last three examples\nfor prep) rather than the University\nlectures of ones imagination - the\nlecturer standing at ease before a group\nof adults, dealing with his subject in\nan interested, interesting, and lucid\nmanner.\nA lecture is made up basically of\nthree things; the subject, the lecturer\nand the audience. An unsuccessful\nlecture can be attributed to any of\nthese three although the effect of the\nfirst two can influence the last to a great degree. Let us consider, then,\nthe first two ingredients.\nThe main arguments against this\nsuggestion are based on the alleged\ndisinclination of the student to study\n'if we gave them printed notes they\nwouldn't need to come to the lectures'\n'with printed notes the material of the\nlecture need not even pass through their\nminds, as it does at the moment on the\nway to the notebook'. This is nonsense\nThe student never need attend a lecture\nat present, he can get his notes from a friend. Y< hen he is two lines behind\nthe lecturer he begins to write auto-mati call y, to become a human duplicating machine, so that he neither hears\nthe lecturer's explanation, nor does he\nunderstand his own scribbling s. How will printed notes cure these f failings of the present system? At\nthe beginning of the lecture, notes are\nhanded out. The lecturer puts the\nlecture in its context and then runs in\nalea surely and comprehensive way\nthrough the printed notes, dealing with\nqueries as they arise. Students add\ntheir own notes and explanations and\nwith the time gained by the omission of\nthe present ph rene tic blackboard chase\nthe lecturer has time for a few worked\nexamples. Result:- enlightenment,\nstimulation and better student-staff\nunderstanding. Consider the second component, the\nleo ture r. It is very rarely that the\nopinion of the student who has first\nhand knowledge of the lecturer, is either required or recognised. Yet we\nhave to put up with some terrible\nlecturers. Lecturers can be divided\ninto three groups. ^u it e simply, those\nwho care (they are rare and usually very\ngood), those who can't( and don't seem\nto realise it) and those who realise\nthey are inadequate and try to improve.\nIf the subject is scientific, as\nin all the bad lectures here, it is\nintrinsically poor lecture material\nalthough it is good '.schoolroom\nfodder'! All too often the main part\nof the leo ture is taken up with the\ntransfer of plain hard fact from the\nlecturers notes onto the board and\nthence to the students notes.\nIndustrial efficiency experts would be\nhorrified at thi a expensive and un-remunerative waste of time, 'give the\nstudent printed notes' they would say,\nand why not?\nThe last group is most numerous and\npoint the way to the possible direction\nof improvement.\nAnybody contemplating a school\nteaching career has to do a course,\nsolely o on cern ed with the technique of\nteaching, for up to two years\nGraduates moving onto the staff of the\nUniversities are very rarely required\nto have any teaching experience or\nqualification. Remember also that at\nUniversity they are probably teaching\nmore difficult subjects under a more\ndifficult but ultimately more effective\nsystem. An obvious solution to this\nT rob lem is a course of lectures on\nLecturing for Lecturers for proposed\n(and present) staff. Surely at a University, lecturing ability is as\nimportant as research ability?\nStaff at I.C. will not deny there\nis room for improvement. '\n.\n.\nho Is\ncourageous enough to take the first\nstep?.\nUNION MEETING\nThe Union Meeting, last Thursday,\nNov. 19th, started five minutes late,but\nin spite of this, there were not many\npeople who could find the energy or time\nto attend. The trend towards poor\nUnion Meeting participation o an perhaps\nbe explained by the continually increasing popularity enjoyed by most of I.C's clubs and so oie ties, but it would be\na sad reflection on all if these functions became mutually exclusive.\nThe minutes and matters arising\nwere rushed through. Significant in its omission was a vote of thanks to I.C.E. C. for the excellent entertainment they\nprovided for the Union at Harlington\non Guy Fawke3 night. The financial\naccounts were then presented by Dr.\nWeale, Prof. Wright and Mr. Comber\nwith the odd humourous touch. It\nis good that the Union should be\nable to thank these gentlemen for their\nwork at this annual presentation,\nhowever, it seems a pity, that, al though the accounts have been displayed\npublicly for at least fourteen days\nprior to the meeting, they have to be'\nread and itemized at great length at\nthe meeting.\nThe I.C. Charity Carnival was\nthen discussed. After some confusion\nwith regard to procedure, and the four\nmain speeches, it became dear that the\ntwo groups of thought were attempting\nto reach a suitable compromise acceptable\nto the majority of likely supporters.\nThis crystallized into a new motion\nbeing proposed,to the effect that WET\nstudents should receive the proceeds,\nand that WUS should be recognized as a constitute nt member of the WRY organ is ation.\nDiscussion then revolved around\nwhether students shou lt i give to their\ncontemporaries in need, or to the needy\nin general. An amendment was tabled,\nsupported by a simple 'rally round the\nflag boys' speech. The amendment was\ncarried, the motion defeated, so now the\nI.C. Charity Carnival's proceeds will go\nto WHY?'.( Procedure, Mr. Iresident!)\nA motion was then tabled concerning the boycott of South African goods.\nTime was moving on, however, so the\nmeeting was adjourned until the following\nThursday.\n\n"

Ken\nisn't it?... \"Imperial Collegebut\nthat is a man's college*\" After such\nremarks it is no wonder that I was\na little apprehensive when Ioa me to\nthe Freshers Day receptions,\n'iVe few new girls occupied two\nrows in the packed hall, the rest\nwere men and they all eyed us curiously. After being told to work hard,\nby the Hector ,.and pin y hard, by the\nPresident we were left to the mercy\nof the eighty odd clu us and societies\nall. eager to recruit new members.\n\"We have never had a woman in the\nclub, join us!\" \" Join the ....\nso oie ty!\" Join this club, that society\n....Where did my chosen subject, maths,\noom e into it? \"Come and have tea in the I. C.W. A. Lounge,\" these were the most welcome\nwords I had heard that afternoon, but\nthis wie rd word 'I. C.W. A.* had to be\nexplained to me.\nVhat was it like to be a girl among so many men? (when Ioa me there\nwas one girl for every fifty men,now\nthere is one girl for every twenty\nfive) It was a bit disconcerting at\nfirst. Going into the refectory was\na frightening experience, I used to\nshake in my 3hoes. One day a big brute of a man, who should have kn uw n better, turned to me and said : \"Hallo\nlittle girl ie, and what is your name?\"\nDespite this and other setbacks, I soon\n\u2022 found myself making friends among the\nmembers of the clubs I had j. in ed so\nthat I could rec of Ti is e friends as I went into the refectory and soon\nforgot to be frightened.\nWhen I started at College I was\ntold about the Vacations Works Scheme.\nAs I had no idea what career I might\ntake up if and when I got a degree,\nit seemed, and is Still, a good idea\nto join the scheme. I was lucky enough\nto go to Switzerland for ten weeks\nthrough the I. A.E.S.T. B. organisation.\nIt is a strange fact that few\nmembers of I. C.W. A. go to the Saturday\nHops regularly. I went to about four in all, but'at each one I met I.C. men who\ndid not know I was at I.C. myself, and\nwho were totally ignorant of I. C.W. A. Sure they knew I. C.W. A existed; but how\nmany women there were i nool leg e or\nthat we have a president and secretary\n- they just had no idea of it! If ever\nI wanted to find out how important\nI.C. \u00ab.A. waa to the average i.C. man\nI would go to a hop!\nWhen I left I.C.I had changed a great deal from the shy and una ert a in schoolgirl who thought that to get a de-roe was the ultimate aim of her life. Now I know that aB. Sc. is not the passport I had thou^it but merely a stepping\nstone, and the more I try to learn, the\nmore there is to learn. Most of all I learned that in order to learn from\nCollege Union life, one must be prepared\nto work for the Union. It did not take\nme long to realise that although tha\nclubs advertised for new recruits on\nFresher's Day I could not become a member of any one of them unless I made\nan effort to show that I was interested.\nIt would have been easy to become \"a brown-b agger\" or anyway \"10-5 e, but,\nlike most people, I was quick to see '\nthat lectures were only half of\nUniversity life, and I had to make the\nmove to make the other half effective.\nAnn-Margret Radford.\nA WEAPON AGAINST APARTHEID We are frequently told that we live in an enlightened age; an age when all men are considered equal; an age when all men share the same rights' irrespective of\nrao e, creed or colour and a man is not to\nbe persecuted merely because of the col our of his skin. We are frequently told this, and in general it is true, but it would not be true if we- lived in South\nAfrica. Ever since the National Party o a mew> power in the Union of South Africa the\nten million coloured people there have\nfought a losing battle against a policy of segregation and discrimination designed\nto perpetuate, and furthermore to increase\ntheir domination by the white minority.\nThey have resisted with immense courage\nthe slow, insidious erosion of their human dignity. They have used passive\nresistance methods whenever possible, and\nin1957 they made very effective use of\nthe boycott against crippling fare in creases on the (segregated) public trans-port. Thousands of Africans walked great\ndistances daily in protest, and they won.\nBut this is only one success: the police state possesses crushing power, and any\ncampaign against it can only succeed with\nhelp from outside. We now have an opportunity to provide such help.\nThe South African government is very\nsensitive to criticism in other countries.\nTrue, there has been no lack of this in the past,and it has not had a great deal\nof effect, but if it were backed up by\npractical measures the story might well be very different. The coloured people\nknow this, and they have appealed for a boycott of South African exports in other countries. In this way they seek\nto embarrass and weaken the present government and make way for more moderate\nelements.\nAs I write this, a meeting of I.C. Union stands adjourned, with a motion\nbefore it on this issue. Whether the\nmotion is passed or defeated, every one\nof us can, without causing ourselves any\ninconvenience or making any major sacrifices, help these oppressed people by\nrefusing to buy South African goods, and\ntelling people why. All of us at some\ntime or other buy South African fruit, 'jams, wines, cig a iet tes and other ime ms. In every case, it is a simple matter to\ngive up buying the South African product\nand change to another brand made else-where. \u2022 It is an equally simple matter to\nenquire whether non-branded goods are of\nSouth African origin, and to tell the\nsupplier why. Any one of us o an,I admit,\nmake only a small contribution, but the\noom bin ed efforts of us all could have a significant effect. It is surely better\nfor right-thinking people to act on their\nopinions, rather than s it back smoking\nSouth African cigarettes and uttering\npious platitudes.\nA.L. Brookes.\nNO3. AVID KAZ EMI JAZZ\nCLUB\nAbout a year ago I.C Jazs Club\norganized an evening jazz session for the benefit of those who wanted free entertainment in relaxed informal\nsur rou ii ding a. This promoted quite\nsome interest and it was decided that\nthese sessions should be made a regular thing this year.\nLast Wednesday was the first of\nsuo h occasions, and the upper refectory\nwas filled with the sounds of mu sio, filtered through a mass of gyrating\nbodies. As this was the first session\nthere were many faults, particularly o ono er ning organisation, but on the\nwhole the evening was as u oo ess if only for the strong complaints received from Q.A. It was fortunate (?) that Dennis\nLeston was secured for the evening.\nThe large fee for his hire was well spent,for his oom pe ring proved to be\nof a ver-^r high standard and he held\nthe show together in a manner in which\nonly he can.\nAll the regular 1.0. Jazz groups\nwere in attendance, there were frequent\nrushes to the bar to fetch stray mu sio ian s. The Folk Group made its debut, but did not seem particularly at home in the Lestonian surroundings.\nHowever, they show much promise in this field and we wish them luck in their performances at the Troubadour Club.\ntitan Salmons and Richard Rush ton\nprovided superb piano jazz of differing styles, and the mainstream orchestra\nunder the leadership of Jeff Kay\n( featuring the great John Farnswarth\nan trombone N Twung well at times.\nA rather sham boli c jam session made*,\nby\" Dennis Lesfbn provided a little amusement for those taking part, and\nthe evening finished with a fight between Leston and a little known\nRhythm and Blues singer as to who\nshould finally send everyone with vocal\nexcursions.\nOur next session will be on Wed.\nDecember 2nd, and meanwhile we welcome\nany objective criticism and monetary\nhelp.\n\n"

The I.C. Jazz Band played to\njust over 300 enthusiastic guests until midnight, when the party then dispersed\nthroughout the building. An excellent\nbuffet supper was arranged on 4 floors and the impromptu bar, set up on the\nground floor, did good trade.\nAt 2 a.m.a Jazz trio arrived and announced they had been invited to play.

The\nelection was to be decided by the volume\nof applause. A noise meter was used\nto determine this, though the number of\ndecibel ls obtained by each candidate was\nnot announced, b 'our beautiful young\nladies were contending for the crown of\nR.C.S. and were received with thunderous\ncheers as they displayed their charms\non the demonstration bench provided by\nthe Mathematics department. (Two\ngentlemen were also greeted by loud\ncheers and stamping, but refused on\ngrounds of incompetence to enter the\ncompetition). The cheers for Miss\nBradford were, however, slightly the\nloudest.. A second experiment gave an\nidentical result and Miss Bradford was\ncrowned Queen of Jezebel. It was\nnoticeable that a visiting Guildsman,\nMr. k ike3 arr on, made most noise of all in support of ii is s Bradford. The\nblushing Beverley, as has been the\ncustom, declined to say a few words.\nAn uproarious vote of thanks was given\nto the retiring Queen Xandra, who was\npresented with a bonnet in R.C.S. colours.\nEarlier the Union had listened\nenthralled to li r.L;c Karn us, the redheaded and uninjured Trophy Officer,\ngave a highly coloured account of the\nevents of Morphy week, including an\nespecially elaborate description of the\nbattle of the tyre, which he said the\nmighty warriors of R.C.S. would doubtless have won had not the puny Guildsmen\nsucceeded in taking off their shoes.\nFollowing this Kiss iom p sett presented the li orph y Qup to Lave Keeley\nand the accompanying pots to the winning\ncrew.

    "content": "4\nFELIX\nEDITOR '.BARRON,\ncirculation1500 td it w dai Comment\nThe small attendance of spectators\nat recent sports matches (the Rugby Cup\ngame against Aings was a notable\nexception), social events, and the\nvarious Union meetings, is one more\nindication of the lack of interest and\nsupport by the greater proportion of the\nmembers of this College in activities which do not immediately and directly benefit them.\nOn arrival at I.C. we were all subjected to cajoling, pleading s, and\nperorations from all quarters not to be\n'brown-bag gers' and slaves to work, but\nto enter into the sports and social life of the oo lle ge and to make I.C. the for most college in the University. These\nattacks have been repeated at intervals\nwith decreasing intensity.\nThe point has been reached when I.C. should withdraw its head from the\nsand and wipe the sand fro i.; its eyes.\n?or too long energies have been misdirected in trying to make I.C.a college of the University, misdirected\nbecause the University does riot exist,\nbut only the 'Technical Institutes of\nLondon\". At no time has the main body\nof students per sued its course in the\nsearch of knowledge or of disinterested learning. The Colleges of London have\nmerely been us>--d to provide students\nwith the right letters after their names\nin order to earn larger salaries.\nThe aim of a university should be\nto allow the culture instilled in early\nlife to bear fruit. In this London\nfails miserably. It produces very few\nwho are educated and no technicians, or\nmore grandiloquent ly, technologists, but\nthousands of intolerant, half-baked\ncreatures fit for very little at all. That some emerge from this chaos victorious, is a blessing for which we should\nall be thankful.\nAll that a university can do is to\nencourage development. i? or the most\npart the people, you and I, that come to\nthis College are ignorant of much that\nis good and beautiful in thi3 world, the\nHumanities and the Arts. hue to our\nearly backgrounds the seed of culture is not within us and no amount of day\ndreaming or wis'n ful thinking can cover\nup our appalling ignorance.\nThe argument that the Arts have the\nsame problems is a valid one, although\nthey are versed in either the histories of the V.or ld, or the development of Art,\nthey are often completely unaware of\nother form3 of expression or of the\nSciences.\nKin ally, one more depressing\nthought comes to mind. 've are all so\nengrossed in furthering our own individual aims, that no amount of reformation of outlook by the more broad min-dea, will alter the fact that as\nproducts of a technical decree fao tory we will give nothing to social life. \u00a3et te> L6\nto the\nCditat\nDear Sir,I feel obliged to protest\nstrongly against the publication and\nselling at I.C. of \"The Voice of the\nHuxley Society,\" namely Scrutiny. The\narticle which offends most is, of\ncourse, the one on the Life of Christ. When prejudice, blasphemy, and unh istari cal criticism are camouflaged by\na label saying \" original research,\"\nthen I think that publishing should\ncease. As a \"bigoted Christian,\" I would direct the attention of the author\n(cautiously anonymous l) to the other\n99? of the research on Christ wh i oh does not support his wild theories.\nTours dogmatically,\nAlan F.G. Lewis.\nDear Sir, Your account of Morphy Day ....\n\"Essentially the official I.C. Rag\nDay\" is an admirable summary of\nevents. However, in cutting out\nsuperfluous information you also\nomitted to mention that two races between the Constituent Colleges took\nplace upon the water. May I take this opportunity of informing you that R.C.S. won the Morphy by a comfortable 2 j lengths, while Guilds took the Lowry\nby a canvas, after a neck and neck\nstruggle?\nIt seems a sad rei lect ian on the\nattitude of the College to sport (of\nan athletic nature!) that the\nbehaviour of the (supporters?) is considered of such importance as to crowd out all information on the\nmatch itself. Yours, etc.,\n\"Rowing Type\"\nDear Sir,\nWe should like to apologise to Mr.\nSmalley, A.R.C.S. far our error as to the\ndates of the reign of Edward VU1; this\nhowever was due to a slip of the tongue\nrather than to the \"narrowness of an\nImperial College education\".\nWe are, however, appalled that Mr.\nSmalley, even with the letters A.R.C.5. after'his name, should think that\neducation in any way devolves upon\nhistorical dates. It is surely far more\nimportant to be able to write gramma*\ntio ally correct English and so avoid the\nfive foolish blunders which Mr. Smalley\nmade in his letter.\nWe feel, therefore, that before Mr.\nSmalley presumes to criticise minor\nerrors in others, he should look mare\nclosely to his own shortcomings.\nFurther, wo should respectfully like\nto remind Mr. Smalley that what we do\nwith the 'six pound p rise' is entirely\nour own o ono ern. Yours faithfully,\nIan W. Hill Charles A. Mathews.\nDear Sir, Referring to Mr. 3ret t's letter in the last issue I do consider that most\nmembers of the Union would agree that an\nexcess of hooliganism, devoid of any\nhumour or subtlety, at College Dinners\nis_ not to be desired. This applies\nespecially to the Freshers' Dinners when'\nthe first impressions a Fresher gains\nof the Union social life are most\nimportant and not easily erased.\nHowever, just as manners, and\nclothes,. make th man, I would beg to\nsuggest that it is the gentleman attending and not the alcoholic content or\nvintage of their beverage that essen-ti ally contributes towards the su coe s s of a dinner.\nIf, therefore, one attempt is to\nbe made to make the Freshers' Dinners\na little more formal and to persuade\nthe gentlemen to give way to their exuberance in the more fitting surroundings of the Bar then the 2nd and\n3rd year students must be first induced\nto set an example. This can be done\nover a period of 2 to 3 years by first introducing table wines in lieu of beer\nat the Annual Dinners of the various\ndepartmental soo i ties, as is done al ready in several oases.\nOne must not, nevertheless,\nthe or is e to too great an extent for one\nmust not forget that undergraduates\n(and indeed postgraduates) will always\ntend to let off a little steam at\nDinners, and that their bank balances\nare not always capable of withstanding\nthe increased costs incurred by a preference towards a good table wine.\nYours faithfully, R.H. T. Garnett\nDear Sir,I am asked by the agents in question,\nto make it clear to your readers that\nthat the Dramatic Society had not\nreceived permission to perform \"Lizard on\nthe Rock\" at the time that its advertisement in the last issue of Felix went to\npress.\nIt was refused permission soon after this by the author's agents, on the\ngrounds that a professional presentation\nhas been arranged for sometime in1960 The Sooiety regrets that it cannot\ndo this play and will do instead \"Without\nThe Prince\" by Philip Xing.\nYours faithfully, M.L, Combridge.\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE DRAMATIC SOCIETY\nIT H OUT THE J TR INCE by Philip King\non\nThursday December lOth.\nFriday December ll th.

    "content": "fCt i THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION No 140 \u2022\n'\nP.ID AS27 th. NOVEMBER 4d KINGS DEFEATED\nCITY& GUILDS IS COMING DOWN CAPTAIN MIKE BREGAZZI\nSHOWED FINE LEADERSHIP\nIN BRILLIANT SECOND HALF\nRECOVERY BY IC.\nThis year as there have not\nbeen seedings in the draw of the\nU. L.oup, Imperial and Kings have\nmet early on in the competition and\nnot in the final as has happened on\nmany occasions before* In many minds,\nthere was the thought that the winner\nof this game would definitely be at\nMotspur Park on Feb. 20th. and would\nprobably take thr o up home with them.\nThe I,C. team was at full strength\nVand on paper looked very impressive,\nbut as it consisted of U.L. players\nand 5 0 $ I.C. first team players who\nj had only played together on oe before\ntheir real ability was unproven. The\nKing's team containing fewer U.L. players was an unknown quantity but the\nfact that they had beaten Reading University whereas I.C. had lost to them\nindicated that a close game would result.\nI.C. kicked off and it immediately\nbecame apparent that the two were very\nwell matched . The King's pack were\ntaller on the average but weight for\nweight there would have been little in\nit. The length of t ne legs of the King's hooker caused some trouble in the front\nrow as he was taller than his props,\nbut he put this to great advantage in the tight scrum where I.C. were out-hooked in the first half.\nSeveral very well timed kicks by\nthe backs resulted in I.C. nearly\nsoo ring down the left wing. Banks was\nkicking and running very intelligently\nto Potter on the left wing and it was\nJust the unlucky bounce of the ball, which prevented the King's line from being crossed.\nA missed tackle on the right wing\nled to the first score of the game when\na King's man broke through to touch down\nalmost under the posts from wh i oh an easy\nkio k gave King's a five point lead, which\nthey still held at half time*\nAfter the resumption I.C, began to\nshow their capabilities. Always\nslow starters I.C. were slower than\nusual on this occasion and at times\nduring the first half one began to wonder\nif they would ever really swing into\naction.\nEarly in the second half aria\nWroaski, the U.L. skipper, scored a try\nfrom a loose maul on the King's line*\nThe I.C. scrum half, Diok Lance, was\ntackled out of possession, and the\nreferee playing the advantage rule\nallowed Wronski to p iq k up the loose\nball and touch down, but Bregazzi's kick failed.\nA few minutes later one of the\nKing's centres was caught off side as\nthe I.C. pack pushed their opposite \u2022\nnumbers towards their line.\nA deathly hush fell over the ground\nas Bregazzi came up to take the kick,\nonly to be broken by a terrific yell as\nthe touch judges signalled that I.C. had\ntaken the lead.\nI.C. now went flat out and it waa\nnot long before Dick Lance nipped round\nthe blind side to score a typical scrum\nhalf's try, but unfortunately injuring\nhis ribs in the process on colliding\nwith the full back who had been given a very harassing time by the I.C, pack.\nMike Bregazzi converted this try with a magnificent kick from the touch line.\nThe last try of the game\nOtto Gilbert nose- dived his way Over\nthe back of one of the defenders to\nscore a well deserved touch down.\nBregazzi again added to the points wit n another beautiful kick.\nAlthough difficult to single out a any individual players I fool that It\nmust be pointed out bow magnificently\nThe I.C. back row played. Both the wing\nforwards played excellent games and were\nalways ready to aid the three-quarters\nin attack.\nThe last word must go to the 80 or\nso supporters who made the effort to\ngive up their time to encourage the team\nteam. This support is invaluable in\nthese games, and we hope to see aa many\nas possible at h arlington when we play\nC.E.M. in the next round on February 10th, She demolition of Guilds baa\nstarted - and on schedule too. First\nthe north wing,so that the north-east\nspline of E1o an be built, and at a later date the entrance, and the south\nwing. Of course demolition started long\nago when the old warships disappeared t but only now is the change be oo ming apparent to non-Guildsmen,\nThe building, designed by Waterhouse (also the architect of the Natural\nHistory Museum), was formally opened by\nthe Prince of Wales in I884,having oost\nalmost twice the original estimated sum\nOf \u00a350,000.\nBy the original proposals the\nground was rented by the City and Guilds\nof London Institute (founded and financed\nby the City of London, and the Liveried\nCompanies? from the Commissioners of the\n1851 Exhibition on a999 year lease \"at\na peppercorn rent\" (one shilling per\nyear). Also under this proposal - \" if not begun or finished on time, or if i to eased to be used for technical education for the space of one year, the\nland and the property on it shall revert\nto the Commissioners\".\nIn a few years there will be\nnothing left of this fine building, a building which has served well, and been\nthe academic birthplace of many of the\nbest engineers. Let us hope that the\nnew buildings will last as well, and\nsee such talent.\n\n"

    "content": "NELSONS COLUMN\n(1) Nelson welcomes back John Hart (ex-President Guilds) from the wilds of Africa\nwhere he has been recovering from a duodenal ulcer gained from overwork during\nhis last year in the New Hostel.\n(2) \"It's great Man - you can get - on\n5/-* This was how one Miner described\nthe new extra-strength bottled beer after\nit had been installed in the Bar one evening last week.\n(3) Is Jock Henry's new rule that all P.G.' s must sign in when entering the\ndepartments in the evening an attempt to\nout down \"brown-bagging\" or has he heard\nwhispers of midnight parties being conducted under the pretence of research\nwork?\n(4) Ntlson would like to congratulate\nthose responsible for deciding to hang\ntwo pictures in the S. C.R. of the Union\nBuilding - they hide the fuse boxes mag-n if i cent ly* It is only to be regretted\nthat it can by no stretch of the imagination be said that the pictures are suited\nto the room.\n(5) The \"Bedford Beau\", alias Peter Grimley, returned to I.C. last week from the\nAntarctic and he has hinted that his\ncollection of penguins is to be presented to the Bar in his memory.\nTHE PLAY'S THE THING No doubt many of you will have spent\nsome time in the country. Possibly some\nof you may have visited the cloth-cap\ncountry of Yorkshire, and a few might\nhave heard of Upper Netherwick, a small\nhamlet resting below the coarse sandstone\ncrags of the dales.\nIt was in Upper Hetherwick that the\nvicar, the reverend Peters, decided to\nbring a little uplift into the village,\nand so he formed the Upper Netherwick\nDramatic Society, which met at the\nVillage Institute every '.Wednesday after\nthe \"Bright Hour\". Attendance was good,\nand helped by his wife, he decided to\nproduce one or* Shakespeare1\ns most tragic\nplays.\nUnfortunately the play was doomed\nfrom the start. Time after time Mr.\nPeters would rehearse his oas t without\nany result of response. \"After all,\" people would comment, \"Nobody 'ad dun a play like this before, plain daft\".\nEvm the s.ui re's son, an Oxford under-graduate, a person whom the vicar thought\nhe could trust, spoilt his party manners\non the ive of the performance.\nThe posters had been\u00bb billed, the\ntickets printed, and many 3eats sold for\nthe opening night, but unless something\ncould be done for the squire's son the\nplay would not be performed.\nWas the play a suo ces s? Did the\nsquire's son recover? Perhaos you have\nmany more questions, but all these will\nbe answered if you visit the Dramatio\nSooiety's forthcoming production,- \"With-out the Prince\", a oom ed y by Philip King,\non Thursday, Friday and Saturday, 10th,11 th and 12th December.\nnig. AROUND\nTHE TOWN What's on. About the Town.\nIhe Royal Court and Ibsen! A. theatrical combination which would, I think make the average Soowgoer\" quiver\nin hi a West End \"short back and sides\",\n\"what! Sit with the long hairs, Oh No'\nNo!\" In many cases his fears would\nspring from a solid foundation of experience. The Royal Court and especially\nthe English Stage Society have a qui red the theatrically bad habit of taking\nthemselves rather too seriously, they\nhave be oom e unable to turn their\nlaughter upon themselves and because of\nthis their productions bear a character-is tic stamp of brittleness and over\nstrain. This failure upon their part\nis highlighted all the more by the\ncomparative success of \"The Theatre\nWorkshop\", which although entirely\ndifferent in character retains the basis\nof both; to present plays of new and\nyoung dramatists and to revive drama to\nthe status of a living art form, a position which it lost some three\nhundred years ago..\nIbsen's Rosmershalm, in many\nrespects represents a complete contrast\nto these aims. Although it is not an\nEnglish Stage Society production, nor\nhas it been written by ah up and coming\ndramatist, it is still in many ways an\nexperimental play ih the same way that\nany production of hamlet must be experimental. Combined with this is the\nfact that it has remained un produced for\nthirty years and as such must be\nentirely new to the majority of the the\ntheatre audience. Rebecca (played by\nPeggy Ashcroft) and John Rosmer (Eric\nPorter) are both characters which\nrequire from the au aten oe much concentration plus a little( and maybe a great\ndeal) of p hay oho logical insight but the\nplay will only blossom more with the\neffort. l lease do not, therefore,\nrush away and read the play before seeing it. Rebecca is a part which may\nbe played in literally hundreds of\ndifferent ways and I think it would be\nunfair to impose ones own preconceived\nideas onto the performance of leggy\nAshcroft, which I am sure you will\nadmire if only for it being obviously\none intelligent method of portraying the\ncharacter.\nI cannot for a long time remember\na play which has opened to so much pre-run publicity as \"The ..or Id of Susie\nWong\". Whatever moral values are <\nfit stake in Hiss r/ ong's world, I am at\nleast certain that her life will intrigue and give pleasure to many\npeople (non-Freudians especially) for a long time to come. ou sie nong is a Chinese prostitute who's really a good\ngirl at heart (aren't they all?), who\nfalls in with an artist living a life\nof monk like chastity in a brothel,\n(don't ask me why). Despite the\nobvious difficulties which are bound to\narise in such a relationship everyone\nof o our se lives happily ever after.\nSentimental? Yea. A little trite?\nMaybe. But if you feel like light\nentertainment and,are not prepared to\nmake too great a demand upon the author,\nyou will probably enjoy this.\nUNDERWATER EXPEDITION\nFollowing the successful Azores\nExpedition this summer a more\" ambitious\nproject is being planned for 1961.\nApplications are invited for membership\nof this expedition and should be addressed to The 'Hon. Secretary, I.C. Underwater Club'. Previous diving experience is not essential.\nPROFILE\nHaving developed a dribbling\ntechnique from a very early age, it waa\nobvious to many that football was to\nplay an important part in the life of\nDave Faulkner. He received his first\nacademic tuition at St. ig bert s College\nChingford, and after a several lazy\nyears and the inevitable games of foot-ball, he passed on to the local high\nschool. For some peculiar reason, after\nonly one year he left Chingford Grammar\nSchool, and transferred to the South\nWe3t Essex Technical College.\nThe rar if i ed atmosphere of studying Advanced Level had a disturbing\neff eot on Dave, and on' the completion\nof his course, he de oid ed to do his\nnational service. Naturally enough he\nwas snapped up by the R.A.F., but after\nhe had spent a couple of weeks doing\nnothing, pushing his luck he asked for\na weekend pass, which brought a storm\naround his ears, as the authorities\nthought he was in Essex. He was then\nshifted up and down the country until\njust before being posted overseas, he\nfinished up in the middle of nowhere.\nThe Isle of Man did not come up\nto Dave's expectation, so depressed\nand dejected (Like-H1) he left the\n\"mob.\" It should be mentioned that\ndue to his dynamic ability, and power\nof leadership (he said l) he raised himself from the ranks, A.C. plo nk, to\nbe oom ea Pilot Officer.\nWith Civil Engineering as his subject,\nDave joined forces with Europe's largest\nbuilding contractors - WTMFEY. The experience he gained set him in good stead,\nand in 1956 he came to I.C. to read Civil Engineering. With amazing dexterity a degree was his, and now with engineering\ngeology as his theme he has joined the\nranks of the postgraduates.\nWhilst at I.C. Dave has not restricted his sporting activity to his\nfirst love, football; boxing has attracted him, and in the U.L. U. Championships,\nalthough he wis knocked out in one of the\nearlier rounds, he succeeded in drinking\nhis victor under the table, which unfortunately took him no further in the to urna ment. This then is I.C.'s football captain,\na quiet, conscientious man whose ability\nboth on and off the field is admired by\nall. "

    "content": "\u2022VLCK\nSOCCER It is with great relief that Ioan now report the appoint a i ent of permanent\ncaptains for six of the seven I.C. teams.\nIt is believed that this is a move which\nwill ensure that all players will have\nevery op-ort unity to be j romo ted or\nrelegated according to their ability. I would ask all of you to support your\nteam captain as much as possible since\nhe has an unenviable job to carry out\nand it can be made much easier with your\noo operation. When he tells you to\n\"use the open space\" don1t just lift your left leg and imitate a French\nPoodle.\nAs 'most of the Soccer Club (and I hope many other people in College as\nwell) already know the cup team beat\nL.S.E. by one goal to nil in the first round proper of the U.L. cup. L.S.E. are (correction, were!) one of the\nstronger sides in the Cup and this\nvictory,close as it was, promises\nwell for the Clubs chances in the\ncompetition. The match wa. very hard\nfought with fierce tackling on both\nsides and plenty of good swinging foot-ball. A highlight of the match was a dual between the I.C. inside forwards,\nHarris and Finney and the L.a.&. half-backs, all of them University players.\nHonours were even after50 minutes, the\nL.S.E. players having blocked the\napproach down the middle but they were\nnot able to cut off a steady supply of\npasses to the I.C. wingers who\nunfortunately did not make the most of\ntheir opportunities, Green the left winger, spent some considerable time in o on tao t with Mother Earth due to a lack\nof studs in his boots. The half-backs,\nDai Joyoe in particular, played very\nsolidly and prevented the L.S.E. forwards from ever getting a real grip\non the game. The deciding ball came a after about fifteen minutes of the\nsecond half when a chain reaction of\nheaders from the I.C. forward.-- left Kinesman Pierre Mousset-Jones with the\no port unity to provide the final explosive s ark as he carried the ball into the L.S.E. net, on his chest, from\nclose range. With a great sigh of\nrelief at the final whistle, I.C. turned their minds to less stern affairs and obligingly helped L.S.E. to drown\ntheir sorrows in the usual appropriate\nmanner. The next cup round is on\nDecember 5th when I.C. play Institute\nof Education on which occasion all t support will be welcome.\nIn this conn eot ion the club would\nlike to offer their congratulations to\nthe I.C. Rugby Club Who scored such a noticeable victory over Kings, in the\nseo on d round of the U.L. Rugby Cup,.\nAlso to ali supporters who turned out\nand whose vociferous cheering must have\nmade so much difference to the team.\nSimilar regards to the Hockey Club who\nI am told are quite determined to win\ntheir cups this year. If all three\nclubs are successful then I.C. will be\nassured of a triple dinner wh i oh will be as long remembered as the event it will be celebrating.\nDescending from the heights to the\nhurl y burly of the League and friendly games, that solid foundation, built by\nloyal club men, upon which the eminences\nof the Soccer Club are built, we find that the first eleven have drawn three\nall with old rivals Kings at Lavender\nAvenue and lost by a large margin of 6-1\nto equally old rivals U.C. at Stanley.\nIn a friendly, St. Cleraant Dane3 forced a draw 4-4 late in the game after a cut\nand thrust battle in which both sides\nwere successively two goals in area rs.A highly successful trip to Cambridge\nto play Christ's \u00bbCollege was marred only\nby losing the actual game of football50. This result was no doubt\ninfluenced by a social gathering in the\nWeeks Hall the previous evening. I.C. were, however, highly successful against\na representative Cambridge side both at\n- ,\nJot tle' and in a 'boat-rao e'. SPORT\nCROSSCOUNTRY On Wednesday 11th an \"A\" team defeated\nQ.M. C. by 32 pts. to 52 on the j it ter College'so our se at Coxtie Green in Essex. Five of the first seven runners\nte. finish were I.C. men: Huntley (2),\nAnton (3). James (4), Hooker (6) and\nButler(7). On the following Wednesday the\nfirst team took on Sandhurst Military Academy and Wadham College, Oxford\nover the home course at Petersham.\nFirst hom for I.C^ was Larkum (3) fol lowed by Barber (5), Brown (7), Cleator\n(6), Hammonds (9), and Warren (11) giving\nI.C.a vio t cry of 43 pts. against\nSandhurst's62 and Wadham's78. The same day the second team were\nrunning against the College of St. Mark\nand St. John over a course on Wimbledon Common. The opposition was defeated\neasily by 28 pts. to 52 due mainly to the\nefforts of Hooker and Turner ( joint1 st), Clare (5), Butler (6) and Gay lard(10) On Saturday, 21st Wimbledon Athletic Club were hosts to teams from I.C. and\nMetropolitan Police. The mato h resulted\nin a close victory for I.C.(121) over\nMet. Police(123) with Wimbledon A.C. third at 136. It is of interest to note\nthat \"Crusher\" Collins is no* faster\nthan any London bobby on two feet. (We\nwish him every success in his future career^\nComing first he broke the course record\nand helped the Club to victory being fol lowed by Auton (5), Warren (7) and Hammonds\n(8).\nAnother team, running at Oxford, over\na very muddy and slow course easily defeated teams from Westminster College, St.\nJohn's College, Oriel College and Jesus\nCollege. First to finish was James,\nclosely followed by Huntley (2) and Bigg\n(3). Butler, Turner and Hooker o a me in together in fifth place.\nJUDO The club continues its improved\nrecord by scoring two more wins over\nthe Metropolitan io lice and Cambridge\nUniversity. On Tuesday a team of\nMetropolitan Police was beaten by four\ncontests to one, with one draw.\nShepherd managed to topple his eighteen stone opponent although there is still some argument as to what technique\nwaa used. This, however, set the pace\nfor most of the other contests. we\nwere unfortunate in not seeing\nRamsbottom's favour ate technique in ao tion, but he scored on the ground with\na Kami-Shiho gata me. On Saturday we beat Cambridge by\ntwo contests to one with two draws.\nAll but one ~\" the contests lasted the\nfull time, and with two to go Cambridge\nwere winning by one contest. However\nthe last two were never really in doubt\nand I.C. gained a well deserved victory.\nSWIMMING\nLast Wednesday and Thursday, three I.C. teams competed in the U.L. K.0 COMPETITION,\nand in the final I.C. II beat Battersea,\nthe conquerors of the first team.\nOn the first night I.C. suffered\nseveral disappointments when first of\nall Coxon dislocated his shoulder,\nand with 6 men I.C. had to go to extra\ntime to beat L.S.E. Then in the next\nround, although having 80? of the play,\nby^at roe i ou a shooting, they failed to concede 2 goals handicap to Battersea\nand lost42. Meanwhile the second team,\ndespite having their captain on the side,\nfan half of one mato h, had progressed\nto the quarter finals by beating Q.M. C. II 8-5 and Wye 7-5.\nOn the Thursday I.C.I I managed to\nhang on to their4 goal handicap and beat\nBart's Hospital by 5-3. The third team,\nhaving reached this stage of the competition by two swim over s, put up a plucky\nshow against Battersea but were easily beats*.\n8-6. Next I.C.I I had their hardest\nmatch so far when they beat Chelsea by\n5-4, the teams starting level4 all, the\nonly goal of the game being scored by HART\nearly in the first half, and in the second\nonly fine defensive play, and point blank\nsaves by CARTER enabled them to hang an.\nIn the final, the 1.0. team really lashed\ninto Battersea, and by sheer grit and\ndetermination won by 3 M, the only I.C. goal being soared by COHREGAN with\nBREGAZZI giving a superb display at\nstopper.\nThe I.C. team of CARTER, BREGAZZI,\nHEDGECOCK, LOVERING, HART, CONNOR and\nCORREGAN then retired to the bar where\nall of the hard won pin of beer was\nquickly consumed.\nGOLF Last week our first mato h of the\nseason took place on Wednesday at Highgate. This time our opponents arrived\nbefore we did. Kings fielded a strong\nteam against us and all depended on the\nlast pair: when they finally emerged\nfrom the gloom and darkness Kings had.\njust won, Imperial lost the match 3-2.\nThe arrangements for our Scottish\ntour prO j tre-ss. So far two of the\nuniversities have accepted and we are\nwaiting for replies from the others.\nSKIING\nThere will be a meeting of the 3 ki Club on Monday 7th December at 7.00 p.m. All club members, especially all of those\ngoing on the club tour to Saas Fee, Switzerland, in the Christmas vac. are asked\nto attend.\nWe have arranged various films on ski ing, and have also invited \" ie ter,\" who\nis an expert Swiss skier working in London, to come along and give advice on\nboots, s* is, bindings and dry-ski lessons.\nAs they say in Sennet, there are still a few places left on this exclusive ski party to Saas Fee, but there are not many.\nWill all those who have said they want\np lao es please return their booking forms.\nThere have been enquiries from overseas students about skiing holidays over\nChristmas and New Year. There is a special tour being arranged by colonial students for colonial students, leaving\non December 20th. They are going to\nSaalbach in Austria and it looks like a first ol as3 holiday. I have details of\nthis if anyone is interested. You o an also spend Christmas at o a as Fee. For\nthose with plenty of time and a good\npools system you can spend Christmas at\nSaas Fee and join up with the I.C. party for the New Year.\nPublished by FELIX BOARD, Imperial College Union, S.W.7 Printed by WEST LONDON OFFSET CO., 307a Telephone Place, W.

    "content": "FELIX SQUASH\nThe 1st axe a potentially strong\nsquash five, when they all play. Also\nthe 2nd half of the ladder lias now produced some useful squash players, and\nthe prospects for the future are good.\nThe l3t recorded a very good 3-2 win\nover St. Mary's Hospital some time ago.\nOn their day they can field a very strong\nteam so it wil i be a match worth watching\nwhen they play here. Mike Usher first upset their plans with a32 win, and then\nSkip and Sec have comfortable wins. John\nv.il3 on fo una it not all like tennis, but\ndid extremely well considering his idle ness.\nwe also had a close match with Unive rsi ty College Hospital, winning again\nby the 3a me margin, t ne match being not ab] for the high standard of squash played by\nlower strings, Robin Jowit's match being\nwell worth watching.\nThe team was well beaten 8-5 by\nQueen's up at Oxford, but has since\nclaimed.with some justification that it was no bb led very successfully at lunch.\nFood in S.W.7. might be , but you\nshould try toad-in-the ... a la Queen's and then a little squash to settle it down. Sec missed the lunch and had a very good game, (which he should have\nwon). After 1 j hours of squash he sur-rendered.\nOur \"A\" team was again too good for S.O. A.S., but had a close game with the\nInstitute of Advanced Education which\nwe won 3-2. Their No. 1 was absent (at\nthe Middlesex open) so someone is going\nto do some running on the return.\nWestminster Hospital were beaten 5-0\nthis year, but they are unfortunate in only having five players.\nOur 2nd V has overpowered many a big fish this season. Their latest bag was\na50 win over Royal Vets. They also\naccompanied the 1st team to Cardiff where\nI.C. recorded a100 win, that no mean\nachievement after150 miles travelling in at in trunk. The trip was made worth\nwhile by two things: the No. 1 match,\nBrian Avient, on home ground, recording\na thrilling32 win having lost the first two; and our visit to Hallingham'a bar,\nwhich was an occasion of a lifetime. Choristers of I.C.'s bar should only be\nlicensed to a ing having spent a oat ur day evening drinking in Cardiff. The Club evenings have certainly proved\nsuccessful and it is very encouraging to\nsee people improving so quickly under the\neye of the short-tempered professionals.\nThere i a also some very good squash being\nplayed at I.C. This is well worth watching if you are learning or keen to improve.\nLast Saturday was an example when Sidney\nSussex, Cam., visited us. The gallery\nsaw one of the fastest games of the\nseason when Ron Crea3y at No. 1 beat Hugh\nlatter son,32. Skip 3ri an hayward also\nha a a fine game using his newly acquired\n\"drop\", beating Roger Irideaux, Cambridge\ncricket blue, 3-2. He eventually won the\nmatch 4-1\u2022\ntie have seen the introduction of\ndoubles on Monday niht s too, This\nis a very enjoyable game if it is not\nplayed seriously; not played for too\nlong; and if players make every effort not to swing their racquets into each\nother's faces.
