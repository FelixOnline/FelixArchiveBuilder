    "content": "Page 10\nLOOKING BACK...\nL ast summer, while returning home, I travelled by ferry from Liverpool to\nBelfast. Not having previously booked a berth, I registered on board and waited.\nEventually, I managed to obtain a berth in a four man cabin. Retiring late, I did not see my\nfellow cabin mates. I slept soundly, except for two occasions\nwhen I was woken by the restlessness of the\ntraveller in the bunk opposite me. Both times I rolled over and crashed into oblivion.\nIn the morning, I exchanged cursory nods\nwith the other three occupants and continued\nabout my business. I went upon deck to catch\na breath of fresh sewer outlet and play\nmoving target for the seagulls. Returning to\nthe cabin, two of the three had gone to\nbreakfast. The third one was just finishing\nshaving.\n'Morning,' he said.\n'Hi.'\n'Your first tour?'\n'?????'\n'First tour in Ulster?' he repeated.\n'Oh, no, I live there,' I said.\n'Oh.'\n'Your first time?'\n'Yyess. I'm a bit worried about it. Ididn't get\nmuch sleep last night.'\n'Well, it's never as bad as it sounds,' I said,\nlying through my back teeth. What could I say\nto him? Join the Army, see the world, be\nposted to Crossmaglen and enjoy the best\nlaxative known to man?\nBarely eighteen he was, just past basic\ntraining. I never asked of him where he was\ngoing or who he was. Nor he of me.\nWe chatted about the cricket results, the\nweather, fishing and all sorts of other trivia.\nWe moaned about the cost and standard of\nSealink breakfasts. We left the ship together.\nAt the terminal he went to the military exit.\n'Seeya,' he said.\n'Good luck,' I said, as I plodded to the civilian\nexit. I remembered then, that I had meant to\ntell him about the excellent fishing country to\nbe found in South Armagh. But then, I reckoned he would not have much time for\nfishing. He probably would not be anywhere\nnear South Armagh anyway.Even if he was,\nhe would certainly not be there to catch fish.\nI will never know what happened to that\nyoung private soldier. Just eighteen, built like\na tank, and scared. Wouldn't you be? Going\nto fight a war of shadows, where you cannot\nshoot except under circumstances decided\nby your Commanding Officer, where every\nsmile may conceal a gun or knife, where every\ncar might explode without warning, where\njust doing your job makes you a likelier target for a sniper's bullet. Wouldn't you be scared?\nAnd frustrated?\nT here is a saying that when Terence\nO 'Neill (Prime Minister of Northern\nIreland during the sixties) attended\nsociety functions in England during his\npremiership and was introduced, a diplomatic 'Who?' was the first reaction. On\nreply to this the next comment was 'Where?'\nOf course, that type of reaction may have\nbeen due solely to the man that Terence\nO 'Neill was; however I am not so sure.\nUntil the current speight of unrest,\nthe government of Northern Ireland was of\nlittle concern to Westminster.Parliament had\nlittle say in the affairs of the Province,\npreferring to behave as the ultimate absentee\nlandlord. Northern Ireland was governed by a perpetual one-party system of Unionist\ncontrol. The Unionists, a combination of\ndescendants of the nobility and hard line\nreactionaries, maintained their position, not\nby repressive legislation as such, but by a mixture of rigging election boundaries to\ntheir advantages (gerrymandering), allowing,\nunder certain circumstances determined by\nproperty ownership, one person to have more\nthan one vote to cast, by propagating the old\nadage of 'divide and rule', and in a country\nwhere jobs and housing have always been\nacute problems, keeping tight control of both\ntheir allocation.\nUsually the 'Catholic Nationalist' minority\ngot the raw end of the deal, being seen by\nnobility and majority alike as \"a potential\nthreat to their comfy niche and their freedom\nof worship (that is, those of the majority who\nwere really concerned about religion).\nIn the end, demands for Civil Rights\nbecame louder and louder. 'Brits Out' and\n'Irish Unity' were not the immediate war cries\nin 1968. What was wanted badly was electoral\nreform, and fair allocation of jobs and\nhousing. The IRA had not yet reappeared,\nhaving had little success with their previous\ncampaign in the late fifties, and often\nWestminster was looked to as the saviour\nfrom the stagnation of fifty years of Unionist\nindifference and misrule. The CR Movement\nwas a just and deserved cause. However, it\nwent sour.\nReactionary 'Protestants', believing that\nany electoral reform weakened their position,\nand opened the door to unity with the South a little wider, responded with violence. In\n(London) derry, notorious for appalling\nhousing, unemployment, and gerrymander-ing, a peaceful CR march was disrupted by\n'Protestant' thugs. Events rapidly escalated\ninto rioting, counter-rioting and razing of\nwhole streets to the ground. Within days the\ncountry was poised on the brink of civil war.\nThe Royal Ulster Constabulary could no\nlonger control the street mobs. Protestant\nand Catholic clergy and moderates pleaded\nwith Westminster to intervene. The Unionist\nheir arch y, now anxious for some sort of law\nand order to return, asked for the military to\nbe sent in to keep the hard men of both sides\napart. In the end British troops arrived in a peace keeping role.\nThe attacks and riots upon 'Catholic'\nestates by 'Protestant' gangs, gave the IRA\nthe opportunity to appear as the peoples'\npolice. Support grew for them in these areas,\nnot because of their ultimate political\naspirations, but because of their appearance\nas the only means of defence. Once the IRA\nhad gained the confidence and support of the\npeople, they were able to move against their\nreal targets.\nFired, as they always had been, by the\nwatery-eyed roman tis m of appearing as\nfreedom-fighters, they gradually moved from\nthe defensive to the offensive. Quickly\nforgetting the original reasons for the troops\nbeing in Northern Ireland, they launched\nbomb attacks on anything that they\nconsidered to be \"part of the British war\nmachine\" - shops, cinemas, pubs, banks.\nSoldiers and police were automatic targets.\nThe intention was, and is. to bomb and shoot\nall trace of Britain out of the North-East\nquarter of Ireland. Once the remnant of\nimperialism had gone, the next step was a32 country Socialist Republic.\nThis is how I remember the current unrest\nbeginning. Since then, there have been many\nattempts by successive British Governments\nto find an instant solution. That in itself is a gross error of judgement. In a country where\nmemories are long, and fear of the other half\nremains for generations on end, any solution\nmust be arrived at over a long period of time.\nAlso, no solution can be imposed from\nWestminster, it must be arrived at in Northern\nIreland itself. But with no competent\npoliticians, with nothing better than skilled\nrabble-ro users for representatives, there\nwould seem little hope of useful political\nactivity occur ing. That private soldier should have completed\ntwo tours by now - perhaps three. I am sure he\nis still as confused as he was when I met him. I am not surprised. I am quite confused myself\nas to why some Irish don't have a cause, but\nare prepared to fight anybody in support of it.\nDavid Crabbe\nUNDERGRADUATES POSTGRADUATES197980 RESIDENCE HALLS& HOUSES HALLS& HOUSES APPLICATION FORMS are now available from the\nResidence Office, Room 161, Shertield Building, for- APPLICATION FORMS are now available from the\nResidence Office, Room 161, Sherfield Building, for:-NEW APPLICANTS GREEN FORM\n2nd&3 rd year UG Students who have\nnot had a year in Hall or House\nRE-APPLICANTS BLUE FORM\nPostgraduates who have had ONE year in\nresidence - Hall or House\nRE-APPLICANTS BLUE FORM CLOSING DATE - FRIDAY 16th MARCH\nUG Students who have had ONE year\nin residence in Hall or House NEW APPLICANTS YELLOW FORM\nCLOSING DATE - FRIDAY 16th MARCH\nCLOSING DATE - WEDNESDAY Ist AUGUST\nImperial College students are eligible for two years in\nResidence as an Undergraduate.\nCompleted forms should be returned to Room 161,\nSherfield Building.

    "content": "Page 2\nDear Sir, - I would like to clear\nsome points which Mr. Walker\nhas made in his letter in the last\nissue of FELIX( no. 509)\nregarding the Islamic system. The main confusion seems to arise\nfrom a mis-understanding of the\ndifferences between ideology and\nthe way a system has to be put into\npractice. So far, in most countries\nthat claim to have adapted the\nIslamic system, a very important\nfactor, that of education, has been\nmissing.\nIn these countries the people\nare not educated according to the\nprinciples of Islam but rather\naccording to imported educational systems which have been forced\nupon them, (which do not match\ntheir social cultural needs anyway). Yet the same people are\npunished according to Islamic\nrules, which is only a tiny part of\nthe complete Islamic system.\nThe free indulgence in drinking, gambling, sexual\npromiscuity and similar activites\ndo not seem to be the signs of a healthy society, and so any society\nshould have punishments for\nthem.\nDue to domination, (economic\nand political) of these countries by\nthe West, the ideology of Islam,\nhas not had an opportunity to be\ngiven expression in its complete\nform.\nWith the revolution in Iran and\nother such movements in the\ncountries of the third world we\nhope the local cultural traditions\nin these countries, will have the\nopportunity to free themselves of\nthe shackles of foreign suppression. (Whether it be\nWestern or Eastern). Instead we\nbelieve the world would benefit\nfrom an atmosphere of mutual\nrespect and regard for the diverse\ncultural traditions in different\ncountries.\nS. Ahmadi Elec. Eng. PG Sir, - After reading the comments\npn the refectory boycott made in\nlast week's issue of FELIX, I would like to make my point of\nview known. Iam one of the\npeople who ate in Southside on\nthat day, at lunchtime, in defiance of the boycott. I did so\nonly after a lot of thought, and\nafter reading most of the publicity\nput out on the subject.\nI eat in Southside every\nweekday lunchtime, and find the\nquality and price quite reasonable. At this point I would\n- like to add that Iam in favour of\naction taken against the mis-use of\nthe regulator, which appears\nlikely in the near future, rather\nthan action just taken about\npresent quality and prices\ngenerally.\nOne of the arguments put\nforward for supporting the\nboycott, about which I though\nlongest and hardest, was that I should support the boycott to\nshow solidarity with the views of\nthe vast majority of Imperial\nCollege students who are\ndiss at is if ed with the service.\nHowever, I finally decided that,\nas I personally had no complaint\nabout the refectory service, to\nsupport the boycott would be to\nforego my views in favour of those\nof the majority. I decided that this\nwould be wrong and I think most:\npeople would be reasonable\nenough t to accept this.\nI hope that I have put forward\nmy views sufficiently well for\nMalcolm Brain to realise that the\npeople who ate in Southside were\nnot necessarily \"the moron element\nwho go out of their way to oppose the\n\u2022views of the vast majority.\", but\npeople with opinions of their own.\nThe description\"S CAB\" applied as a generalisation by Jan is derogatory and typifies the\nattitudes of extremists who attach\nto these \" worthy\" causes, i.e. that\nanyone who holds the opposite\nview to theirs should be attacked\nas violently as possible, physically\nor verbally.\n- Finally, I would just like to add\nthat the behaviour of the pickets\noutside Southside at lunchtime\nwas excellent, and no effort to\nintimidate was made, the pickets\nmerely stating their case.\nThank you for your time,\nPeter Kirkham, Chemistry I Dear Sir, - Having ordered a20p hotdog (not a student-type price)\nin the Union Lower Lounge last\nThursday evening, I found one\nside to be undercooked and\ninedible upon taking the first bite\n(ugh!). I asked the barman to\nreplace it with one which was\nproperly cooked. The answer was\na plain NO. Would he give me my\nmoney back? He refused to do\neither of these things because;\n\"you've already taken a bite out\nof it.\" Well I never. It's like taking\na pair of faulty shoes back to a shop and an assistant saying \" But you've worn them.\" It seems that\nthe college bars are very keen to\ntake your money and offer you no\nservice in return, no pleases or\nthankyou s. The barman, Roger\nPownall conceded only one thing;\nto give me his name, so that I \"could go through the proper\nchannels and make my complaint.\" My main interest\nhowever was to eat an edible\nhotdog.\nIn the U.S.A. that barman\nwould have been reprimanded or\nsacked for the attitude 'the\ncustomer is always wrong'.\nYours with hunger,\nJ. Chamberlain.\nMech. Eng. II.\nDear Sir, - In view of the recent\ndebate on homosexuality and the\nproposed motion likely to be\ndiscussed at the next Union General meeting, I would like to\nstate, or clarify, the Christian\nposition on this issue.\nMany people feel that one has\nno right to interfere with another\nperson's private life, or to tell\nthem what is right and wrong;\nand as a child I too felt this way\nabout homosexuality. I knew by\nmy conscience that homosexuality was wrong and abnormal, but\nI couldn't see a reason for\nprohibiting it by Law until I read the Bible. (For all Christians\nthe Bible is our first and last line of\ndefence in any matter of dispute:\nwe believe it to be the absolute\nstandard). God has said in the\nBible, \" You shall not lie with a male as with a woman ... If a man\nlies with a male as with a woman,\nboth of them have committed an\nabomination.\"( Leviticus, chapter 18 v22 and 20 vl3 It is because of what the Bible\nsays, that I believe homosexuality\nis a sin, which should be\nprohibited as much as, say, incest.\nFinally, I would like to say why\nI believe God abhors this act. God created us and knows our form\nand make-up. He designed our\nbodies for heterosexual real tion ships, instituting marriage between a man and a woman. Sexual relationships\nbetween two people of the same\nsex was not intended, and such\nacts will cause harm to the persons\nconcerned.\nYours faithfully,\nJamie Shotter\nCiv. Eng. 3\nDear Sir, - You may be pleased to\nhear how interesting FELIX is\nconsidered to be. Having spent a Friday in the college health centre\n8 out of ten people visiting me\ngreeted me with \"I thought you\nmight be bored. I 've brought you\na FELIX!\" Congratulations!\nMarian Hill Biochem. III.\nSir, - Mr. White's letter ( FELIX508) exhibits the typical form of\nwishful thinking which many\nabortionists adopt. The great\nlengths to which Mr. White goes\nto try to prove that an unborn\nchild is vastly different to a born\nchild, apart from the fact that\nthey are based on prejudice and\nnot on fact, still do not give any\nsatisfactory reason why we can\nsentence such a child to death.\nMr. White, you haven't proved\nthat the unborn child is inferior.\nYou haven't shown why you can\ndo things to him that you can't do\nto a newly-born infant. I simply\nask you to prove beyond,\nreasonable doubt that the child in\nthe womb is second-class. You want to do the killing, so the onus\nof proof is on you.\nYou say he is merely 'dependent'. But so is an infant.\nAnd anyway, why should that\nmean that you can kill him?\nYou say he is merely part of his\nmother. This is biological non sence. He is a distinct person.\nYou don't say that his mother has\n'lost' something when he's born,\ndo you? o You say he's unwanted. But\nwhy does that give you the right to\nk il! him? If it is permissible to kill\nthe unwanted, most forms of\nmurder, mass killings and genocide cease to be wrong.\nYou say he's not yet as\ndeveloped, not yet as conscious or\nsocial as a born person, and hence\nless valuable. If that's so, a handsome, intelligent, middle-class adult is more valuable than\nan illiterate peasant or a crippled\nGhetto negro (because he's more\ndeveloped), and a teenager more\nvaluable than a child. That's horrifying talk. A civilised society\ncarefully protects the weak and\nvulnerable, that is, the undeveloped, and gives equality\nbefore the law to all.\nThe factory-master used to say\nthat his workers were merely\n'dependent' on him and at his\ndisposal. Remember how often\nEuropean powers have argued\nthat their colonies were 'part of\nthe motherland and that nobody\nshould interfere with them? It was\noften claimed of the millions of\nAfricans shipped across the\nAtlantic to slavery in America\nthat they weren't really humans\nor that they would be better off as\nslaves. Apartheid rests on the\n'principle' that Blacks are less\ndeveloped than Whites and\ntherefore inferior.\nWhat the abortionist now says\nwe've heard a hundred times\nbefore. This is the way, all down\nhistory, that men have tried to\njustify oppression, discrimination\nand rejection. The unborn child is\nsimply the latest victim of age-old\ndouble-talk.\nMr. White, in typical abortionists style, tries to suggest\nthat birth is the biggest step in the\ndevelopment of a child. There\nisn't room to discuss this here but\nif Mr. White or anyone else has\nthe inclination to buy or borrow\nany of our leaflets from our weekly\nbooks tall when PATA gets started\nhe will find that birth - which\noccurs about four months after\neven the baby's eyebrows and\neyelashes have begun to grow, is\nsimply an incident in an already\nfar-advanced process.\nIn similar style, the Liberal\nClub's latest edition of FORWARD! attempts to suggest\nthat abortion is just a religious\nquestion. Well I would like to see\nthe Liberal Club, or anyone else\nfor that matter, try to pin me to a religious belief. The article says\nthat \"the foetus .... has no feelings on\nthe matter at all.\" Is the author of\nt this article aware that, within\ntwenty five days of conception,\nbefore the mother is even likely to\nsuspect that she is pregnant, the two\nsides of the child's brain are\nalready coming together and the\nchild is already doing some\nelementary thinking? If I were in\nsuch a position, and knew I was\ngoing to be torn to shreds by a con td. on page 5\n\n"

The Union is still investigating means of raising the\nmoney from existing income but is confident that enough cash in\navailable.\nThe College's reluctance to pay for four sabbaticals seems to stem\nfrom a lack of understanding of the need for a sabbatical FELIX Editor.\nThey consider that FELIX could be produced on a part-time basis. ,\nBut there will be no change in the status of the FELIX Editor as his\njob is laid down in the Union bye laws.\nUnion President Mary Attenborough is drafting a job description for\nthe new sabbatical Deputy President to present to IC Union Council and a Union General Meeting. His job will include that of Junior Treasurer.\nThe setting up of the fourth sabbatical post still has to overcome one\nfinal hurdle, namely a vote to change Union bye laws at the Union Meeting on 8th March. Union Secretary and election Returning Office Mike Elk in has,\nhowever, anticipated the Union's decision and has indicated on the\nDeputy President nomination paper that the position is to become\nsabbatical from 1st July. Elections for the four posts of President, Honorary Secretary, FELIX Editor and Deputy President are to take place on 12th and 13th March in a College-wide ballot. The hustings meeting will be on 8th March and nomination papers were posted last Monday in the Union Lower\nLounge.\nNEWS IN BRIEF\nTUITION FEES The tuition fees campaign\nwhich starts next week is\nprogressing moderately well\naccording to External Affairs\nOfficer Sheyne Lucock.\nBut more students are needed\nto take part in the speak-in at\nSpeakers' Corner on Sunday.\nThis is the first public event of the\ncampaign.\nIC Union is calling for the\nCollege not to increase tuition fees\nnext October and to bring\noverseas students' fees down to\nthe home student rate.\nFor the rest of this term\nstudents will be lobbying their\nMPs in Westminster and there\nwill be a lobby of the College\nGovernors on 23rd March. The External Affairs Committee is expected to issue a press release today to be sent to\nthe national press outlining the\nUnion's campaign and its aims.\nThe Committee is also sending\nletters to former overseas students\nof- the College to seek their\nsupport for the Union's demands.\nHAMLET GARDENS About50 residents of Hamlet \u2022Gardens flats attended a meeting\ncalled by Imperial College Union last Friday to set up a residents'\nassociation.\nThe residents, who were mostly\nnot IC students, discussed various\nproblems they had with the\nlandlord, London Property Services, and elected Liz Hepplethwaite of Flat 20 as\nChairperson of the association.\nMost of the residents are\nlicensees and the idea was sparked\noff by the work of ICU and Welfare Adviser Michael Arthur in dealing with student licensees.\nELECTIONS Voting takes place on Monday in the elections for departmental\nrepresentatives wherever more\nthan one candidate has been\nnominated.\nThese are the first elections for\nnext year's Union posts. All departmental representatives are\nmembers of IC Union Council. LIBERALS' INTERNAL CONTROVERSY London Liberal students are\ncalling for voluntary membership\nof student unions as a long term\naim, but admit that this would be\nunworkable in practice now.\nSheyne Lucock, ICU External\nAffairs Officer and a Vice Chairman of the London Union of Liberal Students ( LU LS), spoke in favour of this controversial proposal at the\nLU LS Annual General Meeting on Thursday last week. He was\nsurprised when the resolution was\ncarried.\nGavin Grant, a Liberal on\nNUS Executive, has condemned\nLU LS for adopting such policy.\nSheyne Lu cock thinks he is over-reacting and stresses that voluntary membership is a long\nterm aim.\ncon td. from front page\nmeeting in an attempt to demonstrate students' opposition to the\nRector's proposals.\nIC Union presented a paper, written by External Affairs Officer\nSheyne Lucock, to the meeting which also outlined the Union's arguments against the inclusion of non-food costs in the regulator. The Paper said that costs such as wage increases could be accounted for in\nthe termly price reviews.\nRefectory Committee is to discuss the working of the regulator in line\nwith the Governors' recommendation at its meeting on 1st March. PROGRAMMING CHANGE SONIC RADIO This lunchtime's meeting of the I.C. Radio Programme Planning Committee decided to make major changes to the\nformat of the Station's weekday programming. This involves\nthe replacement of the current specialist music programmes between 9.00 and11.00 p.m. with a daily, broad-based\nprogramme of music which, it is expected, will carry a high\nproportion of requests. Specialist programmes will run from6.00 to 7.00 p.m., making a typical daily schedule of:\n5.00 p.m.6.00 p.m.7.00 p.m.9.00 p.m.11:00 p.m.1.00 a.m. Good Evening\nSpecialist Music Viewpoint\nNew Programme\nThrough Midnight Closedown\nThe reasons for these changes are the disappointing response to the\nspecialist programmes and the demand for more general music\nprogramming for the late evening in the bars.\nThese changes will not affect the proportion of non-music content in the programmes; this will continue to increase gradually.\nIt is hoped that most of the specialist programmes will return in the\nnear future, if a demand can be demonstrated. A full detailed schedule\nwill be published on Saturday as usual. John Allen\nStation Manager He has pointed out that this\npolicy is linked to the Union of\nLiberal Students' call for a student wage to replace the grant.\nReceiving a wage would make\nstudents part of the wider\ncommunity and put an end to\ntheir status as a \"privileged elite\",\nin their view. The wage would be\nfixed by \" the community\", in\naccordance with Liberal policy\nfor the reform of local government.\nIn this context Sheyne Lucock\nfelt that voluntary student union\nmembership would be desirable.\nBut if put into practice now the\nunions would no longer be able to\nprovide any student facilities as\nnot enough people would join.\nSheyne Lucock is expected to\nstand for the post of Chairman of\nthe Union of Liberal Students. If\nelected Liberal students are\nunlikely to have a dull year.\nCOURT ACTION? Imperial College Union may be taking a local education\nauthority to court over the denial\nof grants to students affected by\nthe change in ordinary residence\nqualification.\nThe Union's legal advisers\nthink that the Union stands a good chance of winning but is\nunlikely to be granted legal aid.\nThe action would be a test case for\nwhich legal aid is not normally\ngranted.\nThe Union is to approach the\nCollege and the United Kingdom Council for Overseas Student\nAffairs ( UK COSA) for financial\nassistance.\nThere are six IC students\naffected by the new ruling and the\neducation authorities involved\nare Inner London, Dorset, Herts,\nBarnet and Shropshire. The Union would be proceeding\nagainst one of them through the\nstudent concerned.\nNOISE BRINGS POLICE Police visited the Union Building last Sunday evening\nfollowing complaints by residents\nof Queen Alexandra House about\nnoise from a concert.\nThe concert was put on by Ents\nin the Union Concert Hall and featured\" Punishment of Luxury\".

The main point of discussion was whether\npolitical motions should be discussed at Guild's Union\nmeetings. The general concensus of the meeting was that\nprocedures should be left as they stand at the moment.\nMotions will receive publicity for the debate to allow opposers time to prepare their debates. If the motion is submitted less\nthan three days from the date of the meeting the Chairman can use his discretion to decide if the motion should be put to the\nmeeting. If the Exec feel that the motion would be more suited to\nan I.C. Union meeting, they will suggest this to the proposer and\nif he/ she agrees, the Exec would offer all possible assistance in\nsubmitting it to an I.C.U. G.M. However, every member of\nGuilds has the right to submit the motion to a Guild's U. G.M. if\nthey still so desire. It was felt that the motion should be heard at\nthe meeting and then the meeting should vote on whether the\ndiscussion should continue. The rest of the meeting\nconsisted of an entertaining trial\nof a beer barrel, with Simon Lea\neloquently prosecuting and Bob\nHart defending. The barrel was\nfound guilty of loitering for one-and-a half years in the Guilds'\nUnion Office and was sentenced\nto be placed in the I.C. Union\nOffice.\nThe Guilds/I.F. party was a great success and like all Guilds'\nevents was sold out with many\npeople turned away at the door.\nRemember, if you want to be sure\nof getting in to an event, make\nsure you buy your ticket well in\nadvance.\nThe Bristol 24hr pedal car race\nhas been and gone, with Guilds\ncoming a very creditable 6th against stiff opposition (Rolls\nRoyce came 1st and 2nd yawn!l) and with a lack of people due to\nthe Guilds/I.F. party held on the\nsame day.\nElections\nPapers for all the Guilds' Exec\npositions go up on Monday 2*6th Feb.

All candidates must attend this one.\nTuesday 13th March ELECTION UNION MEETING. Hustings and\nelection of the new Exec.\nTHIS HOUSE DOES NOT\nBELIEVE IN\nEQUAL OPPORTUNITY\nOr so the motion went anyway.\nThe debate itself was very\namusing with strong arguments\nbeing presented by both the\nproposition and opposition. Mike\nPickup opened with an amusing,\nin defer ent and lively speech for\nthe proposition. Unfortunately\nthis was quickly dismissed by\nMick Berry who opened for the\nopposition in a very amusing\nspeech: Chris Russell seconded\nthe motion with a talk on\ncomprehensive education and\nhow equal pp port unity did not\nwork in practice. This was\nfollowed by the second er against\nthe motion John Shuttleworth.\nThe mood of the debate was now\ngetting very tense after two very\nserious speeches and so we found\na little relief when Daphne\nWebsper, who chaired the event,\ncalled on Colin Palmer to speak\nfor the motion. A very amusing\nspeech followed which left\nSheyne Lucock, the final speaker\nfor the motion, with an easy road\nto per sue his opponent with a very\nimpressive and impromptu speech. Questions from the floor\nwere confused and often asked to\nthe wrong team. After a summing-up speech from both sides, the\nresult was \"This House Does\nBelieve in Equal Opportunity\".\nNever mind, all who went were\nvery amused by it all.\nDavid Haddon\nVice-Chairman of\nDebating Society\nJUDO Judo was developed in Japan at\nthe end of the last century, from\nthe martial art ju-jitsu. The intent\nwas to obtain a sport which, whilst\nretaining the a gres sive ness and\nform of personal combat did not\nhave as its object the injury of the\nopponent. In this, judo has\nsucceeded magn if ici ent ly. With\nthe aim of throwing the opponent\nonto the specially padded mats\nused (or in groundwork, winning\nby means of either a hold down, or\nsubmission from a stranglehold or\narm lock), it is an intensely\ncompetitive fighting sport, while\nthe incidence of injuries is no\ngreater than in sports such as\nrugby or football.\nThis Sunday (25th February),\nI.C. Judo Club is staging the first\nof what is hoped to be an annual\nevent - the London Colleges\nInvitation Tournament. Taking\nplace in the Great Hall (11.00\nstart), it will feature some of the\ntop student judoka s( judo\n\"players\") in London. I.C. has a very good chance of winning, the\nmore so since one member of our\nteam, Owen Tutty, is the under 60\nkg British Universities champion,\ni However, we will be facing some\nfierce competition, especially\nfrom Q.M. C. and Kings College,\nboth of whom will field very strong\nteams. Whatever the outcome, it\nought to be an enjoyable day,\nseeing some exciting fights.\nSpectators are welcome, all the\nmore if they'll be'coming to cheer\non the I.C. teams.\nSteve Morris\nP.S.

Most Mondays we have a guest act,\nand aim to cover the whole range of folk\nmusic with a wide variety of guests. To\nsupplement the guests, about half of each\nevening is devoted to performers \"from the\nfloor\" doing their own thing -unaccompanied singing, ragtime guitar,\npoetry (!) and everything in between;\nanything and everything is welcome with the\nfinancial persuasion that anybody who\n\"performs\" gets in free!\nThe first act of the term was \"Dolphin Suite\", a highly amusing three man band singing songs\nranging from Buddy Holly to their own comic\ncompositions.\nBy way of contrast, the next weeks guest e were\n\"Brian Boru\", three lads playing and singing\ntr ad. Irish tunes, one member of the band\nspending most of the evening fighting with a set of Irish Pipes!\nMr. Smith, a one man comedy act with a guitar, graced us with his presence the fol b wing week. He\nperformed ethnic obscure, traditional material\nsuch as Bachs 'Air on aG string' and some of\nSousas marches, promptly followed by putting a black plastic bag over his head and impe is on a ting Al Jobon! As if this was not enough. oneof the floor spots that evening was an excel ent band called\n'Arcadian'. They played a wide variety of\ninstruments and entertained us with songs that\ncovered the whole spectrum of folk music.\nPanic ensued next Monday afternoon when at\nfour o 'clock that evenings guest, Nigel Mazhyn\nJones, 'phoned to say he couldn't get here. He\n'phoned a band called 'Waterfall', who were in a some studios in the back of beyond, and asked\nthem to play. They immediately threw\neverything, including the dog, into the back of a van and arrived at I.C. at about 8.30 p.m. Despite\nthe short notice, a hectic drive in bad conditions,\nand a lead singer with as ore throat, they turned\nout to be a superb replacement providing a very\nenjoyable evening culminating in a jam ses sbn with everyone present playing something (even if\nit was only a beer glass).\nA week last Monday evening, Tony Rose, the\nWest Countrys finest revival singer, was the guest\nof I.C. Folk Club. We were to st for words about this\nmans talents.\nSunday evening saw the first in a new series of\nfolk music programmes on I.C. Radio. They are\nbroadcasted between 5 and 6 p.m. and presented\nalternatively by Jeremy J. Farrell and Jonathan\nF. Clarke. Anysuggestbns for material to play on the times in which the play was written (1616\n- 1617) this was fairly topical. James I, the\n\"peacemaker's\" reign saw a distinct rise of\ncivil disturbance following an age of foreign\nhostilities; \" When the drum'sun braced, and\ntrumpets cease, soldiers must get pay for to\nlive in peace\", and ex-privateers and soldiers\npreyed on the civilian population of London, and the provincial gentry drawn to London at that time who \" turn' d four or five hundred\nacres ... into two or three trunks of apparel\"\nto get here (more fool them).\nThe production of the play leaves little to\nbe criticised and much to the imagination\n(props are scarce and scenery is non-existent),\nthe lighting was good (but the facilities for\nthis seem to be virtually limitless), and the\nchanges of situation are thus effected quickly\nand clearly.\nTurning now to the acting, Ian Ireland was\na striking Russell (father to Jane who was\nacted with some mediocrity by Harriet\nWalter). Fred Pearson and Nicky Henson as\nquarrelling soldiers were well cast and added\nflair to the play as did Mark Wing-Davey and\nPeter-Hugo Daly as cornish men, forming the\nFIRST: JAKKO. Lead guitar and vocals. Cowriteron all material. Aged 20. Finalist in Melody\nMaker National Competition; Graudated (?) to\nWarren Harry, and finally became good enough to\njoin the Spoons.\nSECOND: TAM. Aged 22. Keyboards, drums,\nco-writer. Plays synthesis er clarinet, electric\npiano. Father is sub-principle bass player in\nN. P.O. Tarn trained at the Royal Academy.\nTHIRD: LYNDON. Keyboards, drums, vocals.\nCo-writer.

I.C. Folk Clubmeebevery Monday\nin the Union Lower refectory at around 8.15 p.m. fool and wit due tte, common to plays of this\nera. But almost be yong doubt, the finest actor\n(in my opinion) to grace the stage that night\nwas Dermot Crowley as the scheming and\nwicked physician whose sweet and sour role is\ndemanding to say the least. The sudden\nrevelation that he is in fact a vice ful villain\nand not (as he at first seems) a selfless\nphilanthropist is delivered so well that it is\nhard to come to terms with the dichotomy, or\neven believe it, and so it was intended in the\nplay.\nThis leads me to point out that this play has\nmuch in common with \" The Changeling\", in\nthat some of it concerns the lengths to which a man will go to get his way (in lust), but unlike\nit in that it contrives to have a good outcome,\nand the threats and schemes of the wicked fall\nto nothing instead of damning all, good or\nevil.\nThe script itself, I think, offers more in the\nway of historical interest and insight than\nthat of entertainment or art, but the\nproduction reinforces these latter weaknesses,\nand hence the play has much to offer.\nDavid M. Weston\nFIFTH: but not in order of importance, TED\nthe trumpet player that stands at the front. ExSalvation Army rum ou is incorrect but he may end up there. Hesso young for his age 21.\nSIXTH: ELLIOT. Chief mechanic, electrical\nwizard and crew boss.\nAssemble as above although the order may be\nflexible for metric punters.

    "content": "i Page9 DISCRETIONThe Better Part of?\nMost British IC students probably think that their\nmandatory grant award from their local education authority\n(LEA) is certain; and that at the start of each term( and, more usually, later) a cheque will appear in Sherfield. Generally, this\nis the case. However many are liable to be subject to the\n\"discretion\" of their LEA, often leading to hassles, particularly\nfinancial.\nThe most common occurrence of discretionary awards for IC\nstudents is for those who have to retake a year. The recent tightening of\npublic finances has meant that it is now even more difficult to obtain\nLEA backing for a retake year, with the result that many have to beg\nfinance from parents, work through their course, or even drop out. Of course, LEA finance for retaking is subject to College academic reports,\nbut there are some who are considered suitable by the College, but are\nunable to return due to lack of money.\nThe other major victims at IC of the discretion of LEAs are those\nwhose homes are in the London area, but who prefer to live away from\nhome. In such cases, when the LEA considers that a student could\nreasonably commute from home every day, only a home grant is\nawarded. Such a decision is \"at the discretion\" of the LEA and is based\nupon their opinion of the particular circumstances. Of course, their\ninterpretation of the situation may be wrong so, if you are one of those\naffected, it is well worth getting in touch with your Local Education\nOfficer.\nThe DES has admitted that in 1977-78 local authorities under spent their budgets on discretionary awards by \u00a323 million. If you hold a discretionary award and are unhappy about the decision, it is worth\nchecking whether your LEA under spent last year. If so, it will add\nweight to your argument. The next step is to write to your Local\nEducation Officer, and if this approach does not bring satisfactory\nresults, try your local councillor. It will also help if you could let me\nknow of any grant's problems you may have and of what progress you\nachieve in trying to sort them out.\nTim Hillyer\nExternal Affairs Committee\nElection Elk\nVM Well you all came - despite a complete lack of anything erotic\n(excepting me of course) at the UGM on 13th Feb. It was great - it\nremained quo rate through the whole length of the meeting. However\nyou have not escaped yet - due to the backlog of motions that we seem\nto have gathered over the past term and a half, an extra UGM has been\ncalled on 27th February (Shrove Tuesday) to try and deal with all the\nmotions left over - Cannabis, Gay Rights, Victimisation of Celts.\nAlthough I can't promise anything erotic (excluding me) I 'll try to be\neven more erotic than usual, and display my naked kneecaps.\nElections\nWell we're really into election fever now and to confuse you further\nabout all the ones going on I 'll say i) Dep Reps I'm not sure exactly how\nmany departments are going to have elections for these, for at the time\nof writing I still haven't heard from all the Dep. Reps, but if there is an\nelection it will take place on Monday (26th) by ballot box for the whole of\nthe day. II) Sabbatical Officers (yes, Deputy President is now also a sabbatical).\"Papers are up for this now. Need I say more? ill) Other\nOfficers e.g. External Affairs Off., Welfare Off. etc. Papers for these\nposts go up on Thursday 1st March and stay up for 8 college days. The\nhustings and elections occur at the Results UGM on Thursday 15th March (not a college wide ballot). Well there you go, all you wanted to\nknow about elections but were afraid to ask. So there.\nPancakes (Celtic ones)\nOn Tuesday (which you should know is Shrove Tuesday) we have\nthe arrival ICU Exec. vs. ICWA Pancake race around the quad, which by\ncoincidence happens to clash with the annual testing of the fire hoses in\nthe Union Building. I hope everybody will be there to support the\nglorious exec.team as it fights the ICWA oppressors. We're using Celtic\npancakes this year and not vile Anglo-Saxon ones that have been used\nbefore. After the pancakes, I hope everybody comes along to the extra\nUGM in the Great Hall at note 1.30 pm, and fight discrimination against\nGay, Cannabis - using Celts.\nWell folks, that's all for this week, more literary genius next week.\nMel Kinkie\nICU Hon. Sec.\nSpeakers' Corner, Academic Affairs and Stanley\nKubrick or Getting Down and Getting Hon..\nThe Spring term is always the busy time for the holder of my post. With a string of college and union committees this has\ncertainly rung true, once again.\nIn this article I hope to bring you up to date with some of the\nmain spheres of our interest and some of the decisions made.\nLastly I will then go on to describe the jobs of the Academic\nAffairs Officers of college.\nUndergraduate Applicants\nThe figures for undergraduate applicants as of 31st January, show\nthat there has been a slight fall in the numbers of applicants to RCS and\nRS M and an increase in the number of applicants to C and G. Of the disciplines at IC there has been nationally substantial\nincreases in applications for Aero (11%), Civ En g(6%),EE(17%), Me chEng(10%), Computing Courses (55%), Biology (7%) and Physics (9%).\nElitism or flexible?\nOf major interest at a recent Admissions Policy Com m. meeting was\na suggestion that the college sets up a scheme as operating in 5 Oxford\nColleges for the admission of Science candidates.\nBasically it is this. The ILEA will pay for special tuition for a pupil\nwho has been accepted to one of the colleges with lower grades. Pupils\nfor Inner London Schools are chosen on the basis of showing scientific\nacademic ability. After an interview the colleges will give some a conditional offer. This conditional offer is lower than the normal level of\nABB at a level of BCC. Thus the candidate, even though his school\nmight not have the reputation of getting Oxbridge places now has the\nincentive to work.\nThis scheme is designed to generate motivation in selected schools\nand create opportunities for London pupils who are not on the\nreceiving end of an education to match their ability.\nThe committee noted the thinking behind the scheme but saw i) that\ntwo C's, the entry requirement in most de pts is a realistic goal for\nanyone ii) the danger of a \"special\" arrangement with one area. Yet\nthey accepted the Union's view that what was needed was such a selecting procedure and special consideration of such candidates. This\nmeans that these candidates are unlikely, I trust, to be rejected before\nan interview. It is this shift from the emphasis on past exam results and\nbackground to academic ability that the Union is working for.\nLate Night Study\nFor those who have found the new, earlier, closing of the Lyon Playfair library inconvenient - good news. From now on if you wish to\nstudy late, Room327, a Committee Room in the Sherfield Block, is\navailable for use any weekday between 8:30 - 10:30 p.m. However, I should add that you are asked to comply with two conditions. Firstly, as\nyou enter the Sherfield Block sign in with the security guard and be able\nto show him your Union Card. Secondly, no food or drink should be\ntaken into the room.\nA Year of Academic Affairs\nPapers are up and flying everywhere for the jobs olT CU Academic\nAffairs Officer and the 3 C CU Academic Affairs Officers. All very, very\nimportant jobs and need very much to be done by people with drive,\ncontinual concern and imagination. All4 chair large committees, sit on\nCouncil and the supreme Board of Studies. Thus their contacts should\nspread from Academic reps, to dep reps, to Union Executives, to heads\nof departments right to the very top. An active A AO instills a continual\nadvancement of student interest and thinking. On the other hand, a person who just \"fills\" the post causes a stagnation. If you think you\nhave what it takes, see the current holder of the particular post. (Bob\nHart C and G, Steve Ruane RCS, Keith Barker RS M and myself IC).\nVery briefly a little about ICU A AO.I have shown it to be more than\njust editing the Alternative Prospectus and doing 1001 other connected\njobs. Much time is spent preparing for committee meetings, writing\nreports and letters and talking policy. Put simply it's a one-man\nAcademic Affairs Office; what you don't do no one else is likely to do. It\nneeds a good working relationship with a lot of people, a sense of\nbeau roc racy and organisation, a lot of determination, ideas, and\na personality that allows you to become concerned about a multitude of\ntopics. Do come and see me, I should hate a lot of good progress this year\nto be wasted.\nRoger Stotesbury\nIGU Academic Affair Officer\n\n"

Rugby Club had their minds on other dirty things - i.e. washing the\nwalls in the Union Building.\nSo at noon we all gathered to begin the ghastly ordeal and trooped up\nto the Table Tennis room.\nWith just twenty minutes gone Ray Parkinson showed all his skill as a cleaner when he came down his ladder surveying the good work only to\nstep straight into a bucket of detergent. So now we know he has at least\none clean sock!\nAfter this things went relatively smoothly and we were making an\nexcellent impression on the walls with our detergent and acetone for the\ngraffiti and dirtier spots.\nNow a note for all those who scribble on walls. For future scribbling\ndo not use indelible felt tip markers (unless if s green as this appears to\ncome off more easily) - but stick to normal ink or pencil!\nOne gets a fairly good\nimpression of peoples' extreme\npolitical views while doing things\nlike this and notices such as\n\"Down with the fascist regime of\nthe Shah\" and \"No to NF\" seemed\nparticularly prevalent. If these\npeople spent more time airing\ntheir views through the usual\nchannels rather than wasting our\ntime and their felt tip ink\neverything would have been\neasier for us. (No political\ncomment is intended here and the\nabove notices are only examples!).\nRather than give a wall to wall\naccount of each room in the\nbuilding I will just mention two\nthat were of particular interest.\nDuring Wednesday evening we\ntackled the Union Refectory and\nwere amazed at the grime on the\nwalls. I just hope everybody\nappreciates how much cleaner it\nis now - and if they don't we have\nleft an un cleaned square on one\nwall to illustrate just what it was\nlike originally.\nThe most amusing event came\nat about 2 am in the gym. Steve\nTownsend had placed himself\nprecariously on top of the\nbasketball nets to clean high up\nand someone removed his ladder\n(the only way down). Then\neveryone proceeded to chuck\nsopping wet rags at him - and even\na bucket of water! Needless to say\nwhen he finally jumped down he\nfound a bucket and drenched\nboth Robin Davies and Ronnie\nHoward!\nAnd so at noon the next day the\nsaga finished and we surveyed the\nclean walls - a job well done we\nthought.\nIt is too early yet to say how\nmuch we raised but it should be\nquite a tidy amount.\nOur reason for a wall-wash? We\nwanted to do something original\nand this was certainly that. All\nthose who use the Union\nBuildings will benefit as well as\nthe Rag Collection, to which half\nthe proceeds will be given. The\nrest is going to help pay for the\nrugby club Easter Tour.\nSo at the end of the day this was\na really successful event enjoyed\nby all those who took part.\nThanks to the members of the\nclub and to Ray Parkinson for\narranging it.\n\"Turnip\"\nNER A CAR... BUT NOT FAR FROM A BIKE! Use\nI.C. RADIO\nin your\nelection Campaign\nif you are standing in the I.C. Union elections then tell everyone about it onI.C. Radio. In 1925 a mere (?) \u00a360 would have bought you a model ' C Nera-Car, pictured above, \"So what?\"'! hear you cry, alright then\nmumble. Well in 1979 Guilds have been given one, tax free!\nIt's not quite in the same condition as the one in the photo, in fact it's in a couple of hundred bits, (anybody seen Clem, and Jez.?) but it will\nbe back on the road by the turn of the century, God willing. It has been\ndormant for several years since it had a front end smash. It was rescued\nby Roger Serpell, who intended to restore it but never found the time,\nwho has now given it to us.\nOnly about a dozen Ner-a Cars still exist, four of which are model\n' C, only one of these four is running.\nWhat the press said:\nThe Clarion: \"In the model 'C. Ner-a Car the Sheffield Simplex Company\nhave produced something which will give all the speed a sane man can desire, plus\nthe riding comfort and safety which make the Ner-a Car famous.\nThe new Blackburne engined Ner-a Car is probably the finest example of two\nwheeled comfort in the world.\"\nPowered by a Blackburne 350 c.c. side valve engine, with a Sturmey\nArcher 3-speed gearbox, the Ner-a Car has all the usual features of a Vintage motorcycle; acetylene lighting, throttle lever instead of throttle\ngrip, hand gear change, total loss oil system and no rear suspension. But\nthe real oddity of the Ner-a Car is the hub-steering system (Wallis are\nthe only other firm that has produced Hub-steered road machines).\nThis hub-steering and the chassis instead of a frame give the design it's name.\nThe design speed of the model ' C was 55 mph. and at speeds like that\nit is best to bear in mind the fact that both foot and hand brakes operate\non the rear wheel only.\nWhat the Owners said!\n\"It gives me great pleasure to express my satisfaction with your Blackburne\nengined model 'C.I took the machine on a holiday run to Edinburgh and back. Il climbed\neverything in top gear and the cost for oil and petrol was 11 l lOd.I had no occasion to open my tool bag or make any adjustment whatever, and on\nwet roads and tram lines the model 'C\" is quite as safe as your earlier models, and\nthe extra weight is hardly noticeable.\nAfter three years of riding on .Ner-a Cars I consider your model 'C absolutely\nit\".\nThis bike with its foot wide mudguard and totally enclosed\ntransmission was aimed at sales to the upper classes, among the riders of\nNer-a Cars were the Earl of Haddington, the Earl of Fitzwilliam, the\nEarl of Bective and the Duchess of Marlborough.\nThe Ner-a Car was produced by the Sheffield Simplex Co., Canbury\nPark Road, Kingston on Thames from 1919 to 1926 when the firm\nsuddenly closed down. Perhaps there weren't enough Earls to go round.\nAndy Rushton\nDEBATE ON STOIC Those of you who missed the\nshowing on STOIC, of the\nProgramme on Debating Society\nwith scenes of violent discussion\nfrom the debate on \" The Campaign for Homosexual\nEquality\", please read on.\nThe speakers for the motion\nthat \"The House Supported\" the\ncampaign were Bob Rigby and\nRoy Burns. They stressed the\ncircumstances of the oppression\nof Gays and the aims of the\ncampaign.\nSpeaking against the motion\nWere Shlomo Godsi and Dave\nHaddon.\nDave quoted from the good\nbook, though he denied that he\nbelieved in God, just the Bible!\nThe speeches provoked further\ndiscussion from the floor to prove\nthat the crowds weren't just there\nbecause of the camera.\nAfter a summing up speech\nfrom Shlomo and Roy, the camera\nand crew left for the safety of the\nS.T.O.I.C.

Rugby were\ndisappointed to say the least after a terrible performance in\nthe first round put us out of this year's competition. As a way of\nshowing that the team can still play we have made it our goal to\nwin the Plate Competition instead and the above score now\nmeans we have reached the final. So all things going well we\nwill bring back another trophy to be displayed in the Union\nOffice.\nThe team was not as strong as it might have been with captain Ray Parkinson injured and a new front row set up. Even so the line up was\nstill strong and there was every reason for confidence.\nAnd what a start I.C. made! Almost immediately from the kick off\n.Royal Free won a scrum only to lose the ball after a truly monumental\ndrive from I.C. had pushed them back a full ten yards! This set the\ntrend for the match because an excellent display from the forwards won\nnearly all the line-outs and many of the s rummages. However, in the\nloose the pack was not as good, though winning the majority of the ball,\nand this was probably due to the lack of match practice recently and the\nneed for a professional coach.\nAll that remained for us to do\nwas to score and the points came\nquite slowly.\nEarly on Ronnie Howard downed the ball for a try only to\nbe denied by the referee who was\nclearly in error. We kept going\nthough and the first score came\nafter a good movement in the\nthree-quarters was put over for a try in the corner. This was quickly\nfollowed by a penalty under the\nposts from M. Cotter, playing at\nfull back for the day.\nThe second-half carried on as\nthe first had done with I.C. on the\nattack most of the time and the\nscore being elevated to the above\ntotal after a final flourish brought\nmore points for us.\nRichard Smart scoring a real\nbulldozer try following a penalty\nclose to their line had an excellent\nmatch, and Steve Debney must\nalso be mentioned for a good\nperformance on the wing (he\nusually plays centre or fly-half).\nAll that remains to report of\nthis match are the celebrations.\nThe Union Bar was graced\nwith two \" zum bas\" from RayParkinson and skipper for the day\nSteve Townsend - what more\nneed I say!\nStay with me though for there\nare two more matches to be\nreported!\nI.C.l st6 SARACENS3 rds13 This was the match preceding\nthe above game by the way.\nAfter so many cancelled games\nrecently everyone was amazed to\nfind this match still on. A quick\n'phone call to Arthur confirmed\nthis so we set off for Harlington\neven though we were one player\nshort at this time (so were the\nseconds). In the end Ian Taylor,\nthe second's captain, managed to\ndrag his remaining player out of\nbed in Evelyn Gdns, and lent one\nof his players to us.\nThus with a full team we\narrived and, yours truly - captain\nfor the day due to Ray Parkinson's ham string injury - set\nabout giving the team talk. All my\ncool authority was shattered\nthough when I rummaged\nfrantically through my kit bag to\nfind I had forgotten my boots!\nWe took the field to face\nSaracens (I borrowed some boots)\nand the match began.\nSaracens seemed to be\nperpetually on the attack but\nsome good tackling in the backs\ndenied all their attempts. The\nforwards, though much lighter\nthan our opponents, managed to\nwin us a fair amount of ball\nthough much of this was spoiled\nby their two very good flanker s. We held them well and by halftime we were actually 6-0 in the\nlead after two good penalty goals\nfrom \" Do bb ers\" who was\nstanding in at fly half for the\nabsent Eddy Budgen.\nI.C. held out well in the second-half but with about 20 minutes to\ngo Saracens scored twice to gain\nthem the points to win the match,\nand adding a penalty goal.\nThis was not a bad performance from I.C. in view of\nthe opposition and the fact that a spirited fight back in the last ten\nminutes almost brought us a couple of tries.\nNext week\nI.C.l st13 SIDCUP10 S. Townsend\nDear Students, - I have received\ncertain requests to help various\npeople by trying to extract both\ninformation and money out of\nyou. So here goes:\n1. There is a movement in\nCollege which is attempting to get\na professional injury fixer to\nreside at College, in the future, in\nthe hope that nagging little\ninjuries can be cured as soon as\npossible. But before we can be\ngranted this luxury facts have to\nbe gathered to ascertain whether\nenough students are kept out of\nsport or other recreational\nactivities for any length of time to\nwarrant such action. So could any\nof you readers who have been\ninjured this session please jot\ndown on a piece of paper what the\ninjury was, how it was caused,\nhow long it lasted, what steps you\ntook to cure it and how it was\neventually cured and send it along\nto the Union Office care of me or\nDaphne Websper.\n2. Be warned that in the near\nfuture questionnaires will be\ncirculated around college in an\nattempt to find out what sort of\nstudent uses the U.L. U. buildings\nand what improvements you\nwould like to see in the U.L. U. buildings which might provoke\nyou into going there more often.\n3. I should be able, shortly, to\nget hold of cheap 'Speedo'\nK RUGBY swim ware and leisure ware, any\nprofits going towards sending a Water Polo team to the World\nStudent games in Mexico. So if\nyou want high quality goods at a low price then find me in the\nUnion Office every (well some-apologies to Chem PG) lunchtime between 12.30 and 1.\nAlso, if any of you are interested\nin seeing Water Polo matches\nbetween U.L. U. team and an\nAmerican team (the games should\nbe televised) in mid-April for only\n75 pI will be able to order you\nsome.\n4. This is aimed purely at the\ncollege sporty types. The\nUniversity of London Sport's Council is holding a large 'ball' on\nSaturday March 3rd. The tickets\nare 3.50 pounds per head, which\nincludes a buffet and a late night\ndisco run by Capital Radio. The\npoint of the 'ball' is to get as many\nsportsmen and women as\n! possible from all of London's colleges to be able to\ncommunicate with one and other\non friendly terms and maybe even\nhave some fun.\nSo if any sportsmen (especially\nstoats) and women are out there\nreading this and you want a ticket\nthen come and get me as soon as\npossible because there is a limit of\n600 which could go very quickly.\nLove and affection,\nClyde O. ACC Chairprimate\nSECONDS DEFEAT WESTFIELD\nI.C.2 ND's8 WESTFIELD 1'STS 0\nThe side looked like it was down to the usual number of players, as I didn't get up in time. Well, I forgot the match was in the morning. I eventually made it to Harlington a few minutes late.\nAnyway, I 've no idea who won the toss, but we kicked off. The ball\nseemed to like their end because it stayed there most of the first half.\nAfter about fifteen minutes our numbers were cut down to size when\nChriss Hughes-Narborough went off for a while with an a gg rev a ted knee injury, probably caused originally by his epic convert ion in last\nterm's Goldsmiths' match. Andy Pearce, meanwhile, had intercepted a pass, and broken free. Unfortunately, he was brought down five yards\nshort of the line. The first half finished, with us actually letting Westfield\nget inside our 22.\nIn the second half, they had the advantages of both the sun and the\nwind, but this had no effect, as after ten minutes, Andy Pearce got our\nfirst try. His convert ion attempt,however, did not have the length to\nreach from the touch line. Within a short space of time, aru ck formed on\ntheir line and, after five minutes, Roger Butters decided to lift the ball out\nand score. Sadly, again the convert ion attempt (taken from about the\nsame place) did not have the length to score. The pressure continued\nuntil after twenty five minutes of the second half, the match suddenly\nended.\nLiam Gartside\nThe Steve Marshall\nCartoon Book\nis still on sale from\nThe FELIX Office, only 30p "

You mean it is the\nconvenience of the woman that is\naffected; the only person whose\nHie is affected is the child's his\nright to life is being withdrawn.\nWhy should a parent be given the\nright to kill a child because of\nconvenience?? It's not the child':\nfault - the mother and father\nchose to take the risk. Of course,-you do not like the term child, you\nprefer \"foetus\" because that\nmakes people think the thing in the womb is something vastly\ndifferent. But are you aware that\nby the time most abortions take\nplace the foetus is almost identical\nto a new born child except in minor details e.g. eyelashes (as\nmentioned above) and size?\nThe last bit of blind abortionist\npropaganda was thrown at us last\nweek by our ' \"enlightened\"\npresident, who implies that it is\ndisgusting for anyone to interfere\nwith a woman's right to kill her\nown unborn children. She sav s that a woman should not be made\nto support a child during\npregnancy against her will. Is Ms.\nAttenborough aware that we can\neasily use the same argument to\nsay that affluent people should\nnot be forced to support the poor\nor even be made to pay to keep the\nold, the sick and the handicapped\nfrom starvation. More so in this\ncase, as it is not the fault of the\ntaxpayer that others are in need.\nBut in a civilised country we all\naccept the need to make sacrifices\nfor the benefit of others who arc in\nneed. In the same way. it is\nincompatible with any civilised\nsociety to allow a woman to kill\nher children because of convenience.\nI would like the readers finally\nto consider the following extract\nfrom Doctor JO Will ke's\" Handbook on Abortion\". \" For two millenium in our western\nculture, specifically protected by\nour laws, and deeply imprinted\ninto the hearts of all men has\nexisted the absolute value of\nhonoring and protecting the right\nof each person to live. This has\nbeen an inalienable, and unequivocal right. The only\nexceptions have been that of\nbalancing a life for a life in certain\nsituations or by due process of\nlaw.\nOur new permissive abortion\nlaws represent a complete about-face, a total rejection ol one of the\ncore values of western man, and\nan acceptance of a new ethic in\nwhich life has only a relative\nvalue. No longer will every\nhuman have an absolute right to\nlive simple because he exists. Man will now be allowed to exist only if\nhe measures up to certain\nstandards of independence,\nphysical perfection, or utilitarian\nusefulness to others. This is a momentous change that strikes at\nthe root of western civilization.\nIt makes no difference to\nvaguely assume that human life is\nmore human post-born than pre-born. What is critical is to judge it\nto be, or not to be, human life. By\na measure of \" more\" or \"less\"\nhuman, one ran easily and logically justify infanticide and\neuthanasia.

It\nall sounds very red-blooded stuff, buy they do really undertake a lot of\nvery worthwhile work. The following are two examples of the work of\nThird World First (3W1). Argentina\n\"We shall kill as many as necessary to restore order\"-so said General\nVidela in November 1975. Since March 24th1976, when the military took\npower, he has carried out his threat. Thousands of people have been\nkilled and imprisoned, and 15,000 have simply 'disappeared'.\nSuch repression, which the\nJunta must carry out if it is to\n' succeed in its economic policies,\nhas meant a drastic fall in living\nstandards for the vast majority of\nArgentines, and the destruction of\nall organised opposition - whether\ntrades unions , student organisations, or political parties. 3W1 is\ncampaigning to add Britain's voice to the growing international\ncondemnation of the gross\nviolations of human and democratic rights in Argentina,\nand calling for: the implementation of a visa programme for\npolitical prisoners by the British\ngovernment, an end to aid from\ninternational agencies, and a halt\nto the arms trade between Britain\nand Argentina.\nHigher Education and Development\nMany students are concerned\nabout the problems of underdevelopment in the Third World:\nunemployment, extreme poverty,\nexploitation of labour, etc. But the\ndesire to 'do something about it'\noften ignores the fact that their\nown college, which so liberally\nallows the time and resources to\ncarry out such action, is itself\nhelping to per pet u tate inequalities in the Third World and in\nBritain. 3W1 has already begun\nsome research and action on\nthese issues, and some preliminary talking points include: - Who funds military and\nother research in colleges, and\nwhy? Why is so little money spent\non research into alternative\ntechnology? Why the lack of\nactivity in the student movement\non international issues? Why does\ntheN US only have policy on Chile\nand South Africa?\nIf you would like to know more\nabout Third World First, then\ncontact me via the Union Office.\nSheyne Lucock\nYOUR HELP IS STILL NEEDED\nAsl said in FELIX a few weeks ago. if our Tuition Fee Campaign fails it\nwill be more due to student apathy than the strength or otherwise of our\ncase. The chances are that most people reading this will not be\naffected by the fee increases, because your fees are paid by someone\nI else. But spare a thought, if you will, to those of your colleagues, who I may well suffer financial hardship as a result. We still urgently need\npeople to take part in the lobby-a day and the speak-in. The latter is at\nSpeakers' Corner this Sunday (25th Feb.), so please come along and\ntake part - (we've prepared a set speech to read) - especially if you can\nspeak a foreign language.

Well, after\nyou've been to Speakers'Corner on Sunday, in order to make\nthe case against tuition fee increases, the obvious thing to do is\nto come along and observe Council meeting in the Senior\nCommon Room at 6 o 'clock. This is your opportunity to listen\nto the Rector of Imperial College and ask questions on\nanything you'd like to know about and particularly about the\nproblem of tuition fees. As you should know by now we are\nasking College this year not to increase tuition fees, and also to\ncharge overseas students the same rate as home students. This\nin total should cost College over \u00a3400,000, so we need quite a good campaign in order to achieve this. Don't forget we also\nwant you to lobby your MP. Refectories\nThanks to those hardy individuals who turned out to lobby\nGoverning Body last Friday. The result of the meeting was not half as\nbad as it could have been, and the worst proposal was not passed by\nGoverning Body. The Refectory Committee will continue to discuss the\ntermly review of prices and it has been referred to Refectory\nCommitteee to come up with a new regulator which will take into\naccount both food cost increases and other increases on a regular basis\nto the Refectory accounts.\nWhen is a Resident not a Resident?\nWell, if you're a Local Authority you'd probably reply to this \"when\nyou're trying to save money\". As you will know if you've been reading\nmy column regularly (somebody must be mad enough), several\nImperial College students have been refused grants because the\nDepartment of Education and Science decided to collude with local\nauthorities to change the definition of \"ordinary residents\". Therefore,\neven though people have lived in this country for three years, they are\nstill not able to get a grant. Michael Arthur, however, may have saved\nthe day by writing a legal paper on which we have now received\ncounsel's opinion which is favourable towards the chances of winning a case against a local authority. If we succeed, our one small Union will\nhave defeated the entirety of the Education authority's bureaucracy!\nExtra Union meeting\nAs you might have noticed from last week's issue, I have called an\next a Union meeting for next Tuesday, the 27th, at 1.30 p.m. in the\nGreat Hall. That is at a later time in order not to clash with the\nPancake Race, which is an Imperial College annual tradition.\nMotions on the agenda include cannabis and gay rights, to say\nnothing of a late addition of one campaigning against tyrannical clocks,\ncalling for the ending of discrimination against all Celts. See you then.\nMary Attenborough\nPresident, IC Union\nEducation & Apartheid\nOn Thursday8 th the Imperial College Committee on\nOverseas Students invited Sir Robert Birley to speak on the\ncontroversial subject of 'Education and Apartheid' in South\nAfrica. Sir Robert, who is one of the leading education a lists in this country, was in South Africa for three years as Visiting\nProfessor of Education at the University of Witwatersand.\nHe began by giving a few facts on South Africa. Of its population 72%\nare Africans, 16.75% Whites, 9% Coloureds, and 2.25% Asians. The\nSouth African Government came into power in 1948 and in 1953 the\nBantu Education Policy was introduced and students were s egg re gated by colour. He went on to explain how most of South Africa's economy\ndepended on migrant labour and how these labourers had to leave their\nfamilies behind and work in South Africa for a number of years, as they\nwere not allowed to bring them with them.\nHe went on to say that in the instructions in factories where\nPrimary school there were about\n3.5 million Africans, which is\nabout 91.4%, and in contrast only\nabout 14% in Secondary schools.\nSir Robert explained this by\nquoting a South African industrialist who had said that\nthey had to teach the Africans to\nread and write so that they could\nread and understand notices and\nthey were required to work. Very little science was taught and the\nSouth African history that was\ntaught was completely distorted\nand the African children, who did\nnot believe any of it, had to learn\nit in order to pass examinations.\nThe teacher, pupil ratio for white\nstudents is 1:20 and for black\nstudents it is 1:52. The per capita\nGrants, Sponsorship\nand Tax\nThis is a brief survey of the way that earnings, and sponsorship and\nscholarship payments affect your grant and tax position. If your\npersonal experience of what happens is different from this, I would be\nvery interested to hear about it.\nIncome that affects your Grant\nYou are allowed to earn as much as you like during the vacation\nwithout it affecting the quantum of your grant entitlement. Term time\nearnings, however, are limited to 235 pounds and after that you lose I pound from your grant for every I pound you earn over 235 pounds. The\nsame applies to money received by way of a scholarship or sponsorship,\nwhere the limit is 500 pounds. This is the position with Local Education\nAuthority undergraduate grants but may be different in the case of Qther\ntypes of grant or grants from other sources.\nPayments that affect your tax position\nThe general position is that scholarships are not treated as taxable\nincome in the same way as the L.E.A. grant is treated as exempt. It is,\nhowever, up to the taxman to decide whether or not certain payments\nare to be treated as scholarships or as earnings which would be liable to\ntaxation. The way that they do this is to say that payments over a certain\nfixed value are too big to be treated purely as monies for the purpose of\nassistance with education and that therefore they must be treated as\nincome from earnings or 'offices'. This means that the whole lot is then\ntaxable (subject, of course, to the usual personal allowances) under\nSchedule E of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970. Whether a payment is called a scholarship or sponsorship does not make any\ndifference.\nThe figure that they use for this purpose is 2000 pounds per annum.\nHowever, if you are in a position where, had you been getting an S. R.C. grant, you would have been paid more than this, then the exemption will\napply so long as your income from your sponsorship does not exceed\nthis S. R.C. figure. From April of this year the figure will go up to 3000\npounds per annum.\nSometimes a sponsorship is given on the understanding that you will\nwork for your sponsor during the vacations. If this is the case, that part\nof the money which can be attributed to the work that you do for your\nsponsor will count as earnings and be potentially taxable.\nAccommodation\nWe are stepping up advertising for offers of accommodation and so\nhope to heave a few more places than usual to offer. How about a house\nfor five in SW16, or a flat in Wandsworth with one twin-bedded bedroom,\nliving room, kitchen etc. for 30 pounds per week? Contact the Welfare\nCentre' for these and many (well, a few) more.\nHamlet Gardens\nLast Friday, at a meeting in Hammersmith Town Hall, some tenants\nfrom Hamlet Gardens decided to set up a Resident's Association. This is\nreally designed to help those other than occupants of college flats (who\nhave their own negotiating machinery through college). Most of those\npresent at the meeting were not I.C. students. It is hoped, however that\nthose of you who live in Hamlet Gardens will lend your support to this\nscheme, since, without support, it won't get very far! The initial objects\nof the Association are to explore the position as to Security of Tenure\nand Fair Rents and to assist in matters between individual tenants and\nthe landlord. The Chairlady of the Association is Liz Hebblethwaitewho\nis at I.C. If you want more information about what the Association can\ndo for you, you should contact Liz, who lives in Flat 20, Hamlet Gardens.\nMichael Arthur,\nWelfare Adviser\nexpenditure for white students is\nR644, and R41.80 for black\nstudents.\nCommenting on the political\nawareness of the students, Sir\nRobert said that most of the\nEnglish speaking Universities\nwere against the government, and\nits policies. Due to people like\nSteve Biko, a medical student who\nwas the leader of the Black\ncon cio us ness movement, the\nAfrican students are very much\nmore certain of their political\naims and are determined to\nachieve it. In conclusion he stated\nthat the African students were\nvery much more intelligent than\nthey are made out to be and are\ndetermined to achieve their\npolitical objectives one way or\nanother.

The film\nstarted as if silent movie custard pie slapstick\nwould be served up throughout. Lovers of\nwhipped cream fights will enjoy watching\ngallons of sticky gook showering around the\nset. Gradually the director seemed to get\nbored with slapstick and tried to make a comedy - thriller by using old jokes and a\" whodunnit?\" format.\nThe gourmet, Maximillian Vandervere\n(Robert Morley) featured the \"perfect meal\" in his magazine. Chefs throughout Europe\nprepared their most famous creations for\neach stage of the meal and the Maximillian was glad to eat anything they served up.\nGradually the top chefs featured in the\nmagazine are murdered in the style of their\ncreations. All very absorbing but after the\nthird murder the plot became predictable.\nNatasha (Jacqueline Bisset) realises that\nthere is a pattern to the killings and she is the\nnext on the list. The viewer is encouraged to\nsuspect one- gourmet after the first murder\nonly to be contradicted as the story continues.\nThe true murderer ... in typical \" whodunnit\" tradition is the person one always\noverlooks.

Showing at the Gate (Notting Hill),\n\"Interiors\" is Woody Allen's new \"serious\"\nfilm. It is written and directed by him though,\nunlike his earlier films, he doesn't appear in it\nhimself.\nThe film is about a middle-class American\nfamily dominated by Eve, a depressive\nintellectual, and her 3 daughters (one of\nwhom is played by Diane Keaton) whom she\ndeeply influenced. Eve's husband leaves her,\nsupposedly for a trial separation, returning\nwith Pearl, a divorcee, who is the direct\nopposite of Eve. The film shows Eve's( and\nher daughters') reactions to Pearl, who\neventually becomes their stepmother.\nThe structure of the film is similar to other\nAllen films: a series of separate scenes not\nnecessarily in chronological order, but\nnevertheless easy to fol low. All the scenes are\nbeautifully arranged and filmed especially\nthe one where Eve arrives at her ex-husband's wedding to Pearl. An almost overwhelmingly\npowerful scene, it is a very moving climax to\nthe film, producing an awe-inspired silence\nfrom the audience. The relations between\nvarious members of the family, portrayed\nwith telling detail, all rang true but were\nperhaps too open: no feelings at all were\nhidden. As a result there was hardly any light\nconversation at all until Pearl arrived to give\nEve's daughters, in effect, a \"culture shock\".\nThis, the scene where Pearl was introduced\nto two of the daughters, was brilliantly funny.\nIt made the \"tone\" of the film much lighter,\nand it was only then that you realised how\ngood the preceding part had been.\nHaving felt vaguely dissatisfied with Allen's earlier films, apart from the excellent \"Annie\nHall\", I think this is easily his best film to date.\nDespite its serious nature this is probably\nmore access able than his comedy films: the\nhumour is much sharper and more\ncontrolled. In this film Allen shows his true\nclass as a director, which has not been as\napparent in his earlier films. Though not as\nsuperficially exciting as some of 'the\nblockbuster films on at the moment, it is\nprobably one of the best films showing in\nLondon. Go and see it, it won't hurt, honest.\nDavid McMahon( Physics 3)\n\n"

    "content": "Issue No. 510 Friday.23 rd February. 1979\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nFire in Southside\nWhen Richard Ellis, an aeronautics 1 student, saw smoke\nbillowing out under the door of a room inTi zard Hall on\nWednesday morning he acted quickly in raising the alarm and evacuating neighbouring rooms. The fire occurred in room457, which belongs to Anthony\nThompson, a Zoology 3 student, and is believed to have been\ncaused by an electrical fault.\nRichard Ellis first smelt smoke on staircase 5 at about 9.45 am and\nsaw a small amount of smoke coming from a level 4 light fitting.\nAssuming it was a short circuit he turned off the light and reported it to\nthe wardens' assistant, Mrs. Jo Rice.\nOn returning to level 4 he noticed that more smoke was coming from\nunder the door of room 457. Fortunately Rick Ellis has had naval\ntraining in fire fighting and acted quickly. He checked that nobody was\nin the smoke-filled room, secured the fire door and told Mrs. Rice to\ndial 999. He then personally evacuated staircase 5 and checked from a neighbouring room that the windows were closed.\nWhen College Fire Officer Bob photographic equipment in the\nFoggon arrived he found that the\nfire was too big for him to deal\nwith. Fire engines from Kensington, Chelsea and Knightsbridge fire stations quickly. extinguished the blaze.\nAs a precautionary measure the\nfire alarm was raised to evacuate\nSouthside. But most residents\nignored the alarm, and Mr. Foggon said he was still trying to\nget people out of the building 12\nminutes after the alarm first\nsounded.\nThe fire was contained within\nroom 457 and damage was\nestimated at around \u00a3700. Most of\nthe ceiling plaster had fallen\ndown and the room will need\nextensive re decoration. Furniture was destroyed but\nAnthony Thompson said that a stereo system and \u00a3500 worth of\nroom were only stained.\nMr. Fog gon said that everything had been done to\nmake Southside as safe as possible.\nBut some residents and cleaners\nengage in the dangerous practice\nof wedging the doors open and Mr. Foggon is constantly having\nto remove the wedges.\nThere is a full interior signposting system to direct\nresidents to the nearest means of\nescape from the building.\nAlso notices in four languages\nare to be placed in all bedrooms\ntelling residents what action to\ntake in the event of a fire.\nMr. Foggon wishes to express\nhis thanks and appreciation to\nRichard Ellis lor the prompt\naction he took in dealing with the\nfire.\nREFECTORY BOYCOTT It looks like there will be no new refectory boycott for the\ntime being following the Governors' decision not to remove\nRefectory Committee's power to fix prices.\nAnd Chris Fox, R CSU President and one of the student observers at\nthe Governors' meeting, summed up the result as 2:1 to the students.\nThe College Finance and Executive Committee meeting last Friday\nwas to discuss a proposal by the Rector to hand over all pricing\ndecisions to the Domestic Secretary, Capt. J. W.G. Lindley, and\nRefectory Committee Chairman Prof. Eilon.\nBut after it became clear that there was a lot of opposition the Rector\ndid not put his proposal to the meeting.\nFire engines outside Southside yesterday morning\nInstead the Governors decided that termly price reviews by\nRefectory Committee, on which students have six representatives,\nshould continue and recommended that the Committee consider\noverall pricing policy rather than just put up prices to balance the\naccounts.\nThe Governors also decided that the use of the regulator to up\nrefectory prices in line with inflation should continue and should\ninclude increased costs other than food.\nUnion President Mary Attenborough said that the Governors'\ndecision was better than she expected and welcomed their confirmation\nof the right of consumer representatives to have a say in pricing policy.\nShe was disappointed at the recommendation that the regulator should\nnot be limited to compensating for food price inflation.\nAbout 30 students lobbied the Governors as they went into their\ncon td. on back page\n\n"

The following week WiST listened to a speaker who runs a Christian community. She spoke about the Christian viewpoint which, she explained, considers both men and women as\npersons created by God in His own image and therefore of\nequal value. She denied that Christianity condemned women to\nan inferior role in religious or secular life.\nThe problems faced by women\nin Latin America were the subject\nof an informative talk by a Chilean\nstudent at a February meeting.\nShe described the poverty and\noppression of many women in the\nSouth American countries and the\ntremendous pressure to maintain\nwomen's traditional role. For\nexample, if a woman went out to\nwork it was considered a reflection of her husband's inability to look after her. In some\ncountries it was very difficult for a woman to study.\nSt. Valentine's Day prompted\ndiscussion on the appropriate\ntheme of the concept of love.\nMany of the group felt that women\ndid not always get a fair deal and a lively discussion followed Mary's introduction to the subject.\nThe variety of speakers and\nsubjects allow plenty of scope for\ndifferent opinions and the group\nin no way excludes those who do\n' not hold \"militant feminist\" views.\nNext week Judith Walker, ICU's first woman President, will speak\nto WiST and everyone is welcome\nto join us.

    "content": "I WATER POLO I.C.2 nds13 Neptune 3\nI.C.2 nd team opened their Middlesex\nLeague account with a game against\nNEPTUNE, a new team in the league.\nIn the first quarter, I.C. took some\ntime to settle against a team with more enthusiasm than skill. However the ball\nworked up to Dave Chadwick twice,\nwho was \" sitting\" in front of goal. With\na weak defender on his back, he had no\ntrouble shooting I.C. into a20 lead. This\nwas pulled back after two mix ups in the\nLC. defence.\nAfter the first break, I.C. were into their\nstride. Nick Buckland and Steve Madden were playing well at the back, and Pat Porter\nand Bob Bradley were finding Chadwick well\nwith their passes. So well in fact, that he\nadded another five in this quarter.\nAfter half time, with the score 7-2 to I.C., the pressure was kept on. Nick Buckland\nfound time to swim up and shoot home, Pat\nPorter was left unmarked in front of goal and\nadded another. With Colin Dale and Dimitri Papaconstantinou swimming into space on\nthe wings, it was easy to pass forward to Dave\nChadwick, who scored 3 in this quarter, to\nmake his personal tally ten!\nThe last quarter saw a game Neptune\ngetting into the game more. t.C.' s only goal\ncame from Colin Dale, who was given a second chance after swimming through with\nthe ball. Neptune also got one back-one of the\nfew times they managed to trouble\ngoalkeeper Mark Cherry. The final score, 13-3 to IC. A win well earned through a lot of\nhard work.\nTeam: M. Cherry, N. Buckland, S. Madden, P. Porter, B. Bradley, J. Williams, D. Chadwick, C. Dale, D. Papaconstantinou.\nI.C.2 nds6 Amphibians 7\nLast Friday, I.C. played the replay of\ntheir 2nd round London Knockout Match against Amphibians. Due to handicapping,\nI.C. started the game 4-1 down. A depleted\nteam started off well, when Pete McCartney twice scored when I.C. were a man up. Before\nthe end of the first quarter, Mike McCartney pulled back the third goal, and it seemed, as\nin the first game, as if I.C. would go through.\nIn the second quarter play was very close\nwith numerous chances being created,\nalthough no goals were scored. Paul Hindle and Dave Dunstone were performing well in. defence, giving reserve goalkeeper Steve\nTayler a good deal of protection.\nThe third quarter started the scoring\nagain, Amphibians scoring twice before Mike McCartney scored after a quickly taken free\nthrow. Towards the end of the quarter\nAmphibia ms went further ahead, but Andy Smith scored from a narrow angle to make\nthe score 7-6 to Amphibians.\nIn the last quarter it seemed as if I.C. must\nscore. Amphibians were a man down three\ntimes. Pete McCartney hit the bar, and from\nthe rebound, sent his second shot against the\nbar. Numerous shots went just over the goal\nor wide, but in the end a well disciplined\nAmphibians team had hung on in an exciting\nmatch.\nTeam: S. Tayler, P. Hindle, D. Dunstone, P. McCartney, A. Smith, M. McCartney, T. Rockingham, D. Chadwick.\nI CROSSCOUNTRY Before sinking into the usual tirade\nof in-jokes and discussion of members' unusual habits it is worth a reminder\nthat the I CCC are staging the Annual\nHyde Park Relay tomorrow, February\n24th. This is regarded as the premier\nRoad Relay for Students in Britian, and\npossibly Europe. There are over 120 6\nman teams, including 20 from abroad,\nentered. Each lap is 3 miles long and\npasses along the edge of the Serpentine.\nThis year's race promises to be very close\nwith strong teams entered from Loughborough, West London Institute of\nHigher Education, Cologne and Birmingham. The defending champions,\nLoughborough are bringing European 800m bronze medallist, Sebastian Coe, and several\nother internationl s including John Davies,\nthe current British Students Champion, will\nbe racing. As for local heroes, London\nUniversity should be in the first ten, and on\ntheir home ground IC will be fielding such\nstars as \" Granny\" Clarke (for the 9th consecutive year), \" Mittens\" Morton,\n\"Beverly\" Kirk,\" Shunter\" Acford and\n\" Kool kat\" Kelly, and we hope to finish in the\nfirst 30. There will also be guest appearances\nby a number of notorious old boys in an all\nstars team. Coming to the point, we need a lot\nof help, so if you're free tomorrow afternoon,\nand want a free tea, report to the Reception\nby the Main Union Staircase at 2:00 pm we\nreally will be grateful.\nChanging the subject, we are now well into\nthe Road Relay. Season and on Wednesday\n14th we went to Cambridge for the Selwyn\nCollege Relay.\nThe 2.2 mile course was partially obscured by\nsnow and we had to fight gale-force winds\nand snow showers throughout the afternoon.\nThis seemed to have little effect on Ian\nMorton who had sobered up after parties in\nScotland, and shot round in 10-56 to hand\nover in 3rd position. Unaccustomed to being\nso near the front, Bryan Acford lost 3 places,\nbut still went \"Eyeballs Out\" to record 11-19. Next off was \" Marathon Mark\" Pickard\nwho ran strongly to pull us back to fourth\nwith a time of 11-20.\nOn Saturday a small, but elite, band\ndeserted the dubious delights of College\nMinibuses for the more random horrors of\nBritish Rail's\" Flying Bananas\". After a1 hour late arrival at Bristol, our chauffeur\n(Mick's Brother) took us to the course, which\nwas frozen solid and partially covered in\nsnow, and would obviously be very\ntreacherous. The race started half-an-hour\nlate, to give the tardy Reading Team time to\nchange. Over the tough 6 mile course, it was\nthe \" old firm\" of Morton and Acford who\nsaved the day, performing superbly to finish\n19th and 25th respectively. Mick Kelly had\nan o iT day and was forced to drop out, but the\nteam was completed by a below par Banana\n(non-flying variety) Harrington in 61st and\nIan Alvey in 64th. This was the 3rd race in\nthe Reebok Southern Universities League,\nand we now lie 8th,100 pts behind Oxford\nPoly, who look set to win the College's Trophy.\nMeanwhile, the 'B' team were priv il edged to welcome back the Club Captain, Ian\nAlvey, after a long absence. Ian came round\nin 12-09 to hand over to Tim Hay ward in\n22nd place, who gained one position,\nalthough his time of 13-11 was somewhat\ndisappointing.\nSid (R.I.P.) f \u2014 \u2014 \" \" TABLE TENNIS I think I 'll start this week with the first team\nyet again. As on Tuesday they furthered their\nhopes for promotion considerably: - they\ninflicted a72( home) defeat on N.A.L. G.O. who had, in the previous three weeks, beaten\nall the top three teams in their division (4).\nThis win was achieved by regulars Kumar and\nLakhani, and second team star - Andy Tye,\nleaving the top league placings wide open.\nMeanwhile the 2nd team played:\nEXILES V( Home), winning 6 - 3\nHelped by the team spirit of the opposition\n(none of whom had met before), the seconds\nwon yet again, staying on top of division 5.\nAndy won 3 again, Farzin won 2, and poor\nlittle Roland (minus his bat - left by Jeff Stean\nat Gainsford), won only 1 - Aaaah!\nI.C. Ill vGA IN S FORD Vl(away)\nDespite the 1-8 score, was not a terribly\nde moral ising defeat, as they are clear at the\ntop of the league (excuses, excuses!) and\nStean did improve on his previous\nperformance against the same team, by\nwinning a set! (Ian Reed and I also \"played\").\nI.C. IV v BARBICAN C.C. II (home)\nThis should have taken place on Friday,\nonly Barbican arrived on Wednesday (their\nmistake) and then postponed the fixture.\nAnd finally, I would like serious (that's a laugh!) suggestions (preferably written on\npound notes - or fiver s, etc.) as to an alter-ego, persona, nom-de-plume or alias for next\nterm. (Yes, Wonder Woman was suggested,\nseveral times, and the idea is under\nconsideration!?!).\nSuper (for the moment) Hewk\nTENPIN BOWLING\nLast Saturday saw London's first win in the\nLeague for at least three years, beating\nPortsmouth. Even so, the 9-1 score-line was a slight disappointment, considering the\nalmost total domination of the home side.\nAfter a walkover by the ladies team and a comprehensive 4-0 win for the firsts, and with\nboth the second and third teams leading 2-0,\nPortsmouth staged a comeback. The thirds\nmanaged to hold on, for a40 win, but\ndisappointing bowling from the seconds led\nto a22 draw, thus dropping a point.\nOn the whole, London bowled to average\nindividually, apart from a superb series from\nEdmond Ng. His first game of 258, without\ndoubt a club record, heralded a fine 625\nseries.\nThis excellent result meant the team\ntravelled down to Portsmouth for the return,\nwith hopes of another good result. It was not\nto be. While the firsts and seconds both won\neasily, the home team seeming to take little\ninterest in the match, a depleted third team\nand the (full-strength) ladies team were\nunable to produce any shocks. A measure of\nthe seconds win is that they did better than\nPortsmouth's firsts, due mainly to a consistent series from Brian MacGowan with\n190,187, 187 games. The final result was a55 draw against the weakest team in the division. These matches complete the club's league\nfixtures for the year. Despite a great\nimprovement in performances, compared to\nthe last few years, due mainly to consistent,\nhigh-scoring results from the firsts, only third\nposition was reached in the league. However\nthe top teams, Southampton and Brunei, rely\nmore on strength in depth, so the best\nindividual London bowlers have good\nchances in tournaments in the next few\nweeks.\n\n"

In fact I don't recall devouring a single one since I arrived at college.\nYes, I was shocked at the price, but it was worth it. Anyhow\nthis article is not about value for money.\nUpon sitting down with the beauty begging on a plate in front\nof me, I was reminded of the di section problem.\n\" What' s the maximum number of pieces you can get with three\nsimultaneous cuts through one doughnut?\"\nI had vague memories of the solution but was not certain. I closed my\neyes and tried to picture it but the problem gave me a headache so I gave up for a short while.\nThen I hit on the idea of actually trying out the cuts on a real\ndoughnut, so I purchased a couple to bring back with me for this\npurpose.\nObtaining the full set of pieces was not easy. After finding that\nreasonably predictable cuts could be made with embedded toothpicks\nas guides, I made my first full-scale section, only to discover that no\ntrace of two of the smaller pieces could be found. (There were plenty of\ncrumbs, but I suppose they don't count.)\nIt turned out that the requirement that three planes be cut through a doughnut necessitates not only care in cutting but very thorough\nprovision against movement under pressure as successive cuts are made.\nOn my final doughnut, using steel skewers instead of toothpicks, I achieved complete success and obtained more pieces than I should but\nthis was due to the fact that the hole was not very round.\nA very thin hul u hoop-shaped doughnut might make cutting easier\nbut I have not seen any on sale, so this theory might be difficult to\nexplore.\nJohn Shuttleworth\nI.
