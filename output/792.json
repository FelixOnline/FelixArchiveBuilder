    "content": "im \u2014\nRobocop\nThis film has received so much hype\nand coverage already that I can't believe that anything I 'll say will\ninfluence people one way or the other,\nso I 'll keep it short, for a change.\nRobocop has many ingredients\u2014\nThe 2000AD comic series, The Six\nMillion Dollar Man, even The\nTerminator. But whilst the\nTerminator was a machine in human\nguise, Robocop, rebuilt from the\nbrutally blasted remains of Patrolman\nMurphy, is a human in robot guise.\nWhen he's rebuilt, Murphy has all\nof his memories erased by Security\nConcepts, the company to whom he\nbelongs. He carries out his directives\nto uphold the law and protect the\ninnocent to the letter. But slowly his\nold self begins to emerge\u2014first in\nmannerisms, then in memories of his\nwife, child and the people who\nexecuted him. And so runs a gripping\nyarn that involves high-tech\nweaponry, a nightmare ghetto that is\nDetroit, scheming company\nexecutives and at witch y three ton\nmalfunctioning law.-enforcement\nrobot called ED-209. All these\nelements come together to make a stylish and exciting film packed with\nrazor-sharp black humour. The\nviolence does tend to excess, but it is\nin true comic book style, with bizarre\nand grotesque deaths reserved for all\nthe bad guys. Given that he spends\nmost of the film under a mask, Peter\nWeller is excellent as\nMurphy/Robocop. Equally\nconvincing is Nancy Allen as his\npartner, Lewis.\nRobocop is a dead cert night out at\nthe movies. Don't miss it!\nH, ft tiu uf, WAV Eight years ago or so, condoms were\nthings called 'rubbers' that you\nproduced when your school mistress\nwas being excessively boring and\nblew up behind her back, much to the\ndelight of your classmates. Their\nhowls of laughter would invariably\nattract her attention and the old bat\nwould grin sadistically and make you\nstand in the corner of the classroom\nwith the thing held between your\nteeth. This was the first hint you ever\ngot that there was more to those little\nthings than met the eye. When you\nfinally found out what they were\nreally for (usually in the school\nplayground), reactions ranged from\nstony stares of disbelief to 'gimme\none, Iwan ny try'. A few years later\nyou'd find out that all respectable\nguys carried these magic bits of\ncoloured rubber in their wallets in\ncase of emergencies\u2014so you'd rush\ninto your dad's study as soon as he\nwent to make a cup of coffee and\nspend two minutes excitedly rifling\nthrough his wallet trying to find the\nlittle foil packet. Disappointed to find\nthat my dad obviously wasn'ta respectable guy, I spent two hours\nwith my head buried in the Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary, starting at 'rubber\n(noun) colo qui al...', progressing to\n'intercourse', 'ejaculation', etc etc.\nAfter this DIY education (and\nmanaging to surreptitiously grab a look at an issue of 'Playboy' or\n'Penthouse', usually placed\ntant ali singly beyond your average\nschool kid's reach) you grow up, and\nthings go (or come) in any number of\ndirections: either you carry the things\naround, get hideously embarrassed\nwhen they pop out when you're\nfumbling for change for the bus, and\nwhen you produce them the first time\nyou get off with a girl she promptly\nstarts laughing her head off. Another\nalternative is that you end up with a successful seduction on your hands,\nor, like me, you read the SAS survival\nmanual and find out that condoms\nshould be included in every survival\nkit as they make excellent emergency\nwater carriers, having large capacities\nand being extremely tough.\nWhich is an interesting point: why\nare condoms endowed with such\nmassive capacities? I could!\n' understand if they were designed for!\nKing Kong, but poor old humble male >\nHomo sapiens? Even the most j generous sex manual credits us with!\nbeing able to produce just over a teaspoonful. And colours? (The\ncondoms, I mean, not.. .never mind.)\nAnyway; colours? You're supposed |\nto wear them on your dick, (or your:\nhead, depending on the concentration\nof alcohol in your body) for heaven'sj sake, not hold them up to the light to\nadmire. Mind you, I did once work\nin a theatre where the lighting director\nswore by condoms as a convenient\nmethod of producing subtle lighting\neffects (and producing the stink of\nburning rubber).\nOh well, time to stop skirting\naround the subject\u2014on with the\nreview. I ran a few tests, all under\nstrict lab conditions, at standard room\ntemperature and pressure.\nOne: Jumping up and down on a Mate as viciously as possible. It\nsurvived\u2014although I guess that I 'll\nknow for sure in nine months time.\nTwo: Attaching a Mate to a water\ntap and filling to detonation point.\nThe SAS manual is quite right\u2014they\nhave a high capacity. But unless you\nhave the ejaculatory capacity of a ten\ninch naval gun I think that Mates will\ndo the job of holding the little bastards\nquite adequately.\nThree: Mates make satisfactory\neverlasting chewing gum. Pop a couple of Polos in one, pop it in, and\nyou 're away. The occasional top-up\nPolo helps to keep the flavour going.\nFour: Sex. You go through the most\nembarrassing five minutes of your life,\nwishing you were Jonathan Ross and\nhad the guts to just whip one out and\nwave it around, and then you find out\nthat she's on the pill anyway.\nI don't know about their effects on\nperformance, but I can easily believe\nthat they're more effective and\ncomfortable than cellophane wrap,\nold Mars Bar packets, barbed wire,\netc.\nOkay, so far it's been pretty\nlighthearted. However, here are a few\nfacts to be faced: the special climate\nof the world is changing pretty darned\nfast, thanks to AIDS and 'Fatal\nAttraction'. And at the present time,\nit looks like condoms are the only way\nof safely indulging yourself, whatever\nyour sexual preferences. The first\ntime around you feel like apl on ker. 'So what? To a girl nothing looks more\nridiculous than a guy in his\nunderpants and socks anyway, so how\ncould a condom make things any\nworse?\nYou might find the Government\nand Durex ads funny, and, in a way,\nthey are. But they also make a genuine point\u2014you're a hell of a lot\nsafer with those little bits of coloured\nrubber.\nYawn, goes everybody, he's! moral ising. Okay, sod it.\nOne final tip: A survey in America!\nshowed that women liked red and;\ngreen ones. i Charles Robin\n11 Friday February 5th1988 FELIX\n\n"

Did we catch you out? This small 16\npager contains some of the best\nhumour at Imperial this week. God\nhelp us! Last week I told you that only\nvaguely funny articles would be\nprinted in this special Comic Relief\nissue. Perhaps these words fell on\nblind eyes. There wasn'ta solitary\namusing letter or article from any of\nyou. I could make the excuse that 16\npages was the maximum number of\nnon-serious pages I could possibly get\naway with but the truth of the matter\nis that our printing press once again\nplayed the ultimate trick on me and\nbroke down on Monday and amusing\ncopy was very thin on the ground. I expect to see every one of you\nwearing a red nose, whether it be an\nofficial one or a home-made FELIX\none to make up for it. I hope that you\nwill drop at least lOp into our rag can\ntoday.

    "content": "WKHHBk\nI FELIX Well 1 suppose it had to happen, the\nEditor has gone quite mad this week\ntrying to get us to write witty pieces\nfor this Comic Relief issue. Judith has\neven threatened to add a red nose to\nmy photo too, really all this wackiness\ncan get quite unfunny. Having read\nsome of the so-called 'funnies', I am\nconvinced that scientists are the most\nunfunny people in the world. Imperial\ndef mate ly needs arts students.\nI would also like to know what\npeople are going to have to do to be\noud an dish ly funny in the future. I am\nreminded of the phrase T have\nnothing against political jokes, it's when they get elected I object'\nespecially with the Union elections on\nthe way. These organised one\nup man ship competitions tend to bring\nout the worst in people, with blatant\ndislike of opponents often appearing\nas sweeter than nut ra sweet niceness.\nWhy don't candidates realise that we\ncan all make our own decisions. I will\nprobably vote for the candidate who\nmakes a greater effort to actually\nlisten to students.\nIn this cold ish weather I have been\nforced to wear a scarf and I thought\nnothing of putting on my CCU scarf.\nHowever it was pointed out by my\nsister the other day that I must care\na great deal for my college to go\nthrough with wearing such a dreadfully uncoordinated accessory.\nI must admit to not caring a great deal\nfor CCU rivalry, so I suppose my\nsister must be right. Then I thought\nof the alternative Imperial C CU scarves. Really there isn'ta decent\nscarf design going. Perhaps this is a sad reflection on Imperial not having\nan arts department. Might I suggest\nthat on seeing the tasteful St Mary's scarf, that plain blue with white Fleur\nde Lis would be more acceptable.\nNaturally the fussy elements of the\nstudent establishment will want their\ngang's/ CCU's emblem on the end.\nHowever, I would certainly welcome\nthe new breed of scarf.\nFinally, a joke to please Judith:\nHow many FELIX Editors does it\ntake to change a light bulb? ANS\u2014\nThree. One to put it on the list, one\nto delegate the job and one to cross\nit off the list when someone else has.\ndone it.\nRecord Rag\nTotals Reached\nRound-Up\nSo far this academic year Rag have\nraised \u00a315,000, \u00a34,000 of which has\nalready been given to charities for\nwhom special collections were\nundertaken. These charities are:\nAction Aid, Mencap, Amnesty\nInternational and the World Wildlife\nFund. The \u00a311,000 and the money we\naim to raise this term, will be paid to\n'our' charities next January.\nSince the Rag incentive scheme\nstarted in October, 14 people have\nbeen awarded f shirts by raising \u00a3100\nand 4 sweatshirts for collecting over\n\u00a3250. The 'mega-collectors' who\nhave earned sweatshirts are:.\nDave Williams (Physics 2) \u00a3428.56\nDave Tyler (Chem Eng 4) \u00a3359.93.\nFiona Nicholas (Biochem 2) \u00a3352.93\nNancy Reading (Life Sci 1) \u00a3259.98\nTo add an extra incentive for these,\nand those who will pass the \u00a3250\nmark in the near future, the scheme\nhas been extended. Anyone raising\n\u00a3600 will be given a special '600\nClub' sweater and \u00a31000 will earn an\nengraved pewter tankard.\nForthcoming Events\nFriday 12th February\nMilk Tray delivery service\nI'm sure you've all seen the advert on\nthe telly where the 'hero' battles\nagainst all evils to deliver a box of\nMilk Tray to his love. On Friday\nFebruary 12, to celebrate St\nValentine's Day on the Sunday, Rag\nare running their own delivery service\nfrom the Guilds Office. A Rag 'super\nhero', all clad in black will deliver a box of Milk Tray to your Valentine\nin the middle of one of his/her\nlectures. Orders are being taken in the\nGuilds Office and must be placed by\nThursday 4th, the cost is only \u00a32.50\nwhich also covers the cost of the\nchocolates. Here's your chance to\nshow what a romantic you really are!\nSaturday 20th February\nMonopoly Rag\nTo coincide with BIBIC's London\nflag day, Rag are running their\npopular human version of the\nWaddington's game of Monopoly.\nTeams of four people, preferably in\nfancy dress, will travel the board (the\nstreets of London) collecting money\nand solving clues while trying not to\nbe 'nicked' by the roving 'Police\nVan'. Monopoly is a great day out\nand there's a free party for the players\nin the Union Building in the evening.\nIC Rag is being joined by Rags from\n15 other colleges and so it should be\nvery successful.\nSunday 27th Mar, Saturday 2nd Apr\n140 mile bed push\nFor the first week of the Easter\nholidays, 17 people will be\nendeavour ing to push an old hospital\nbed, given to us by St Mary's, from\nKnowle Hall in Somerset back to\nCollege.

I know its been said before, and no doubt it\nwill be said again, but one of the disadvantages of running\na democracy is that you have to try and let everyone have\na fair say. However unpalatable this idea may appear to\nyou, it does from time to time tend to cause what you\ndescribe as 'petty squabbling'. This, however, was not\nthe case at the last Council: anybody who was following\nthe debate with any interest would have told you that, in\nthe proposed job descriptions, all Union officers would\nhave been 'responsible to the President and the UGM'.\nThis would have put the President of the Union on a level\nequal to that of the UGM, with the consequent powers\nto dismiss any officer at any time, etc. It was this that\nmany members of Council were opposed to. The debate\nthat ensued, far from being 'petty squabbling', was an\neffort to remove this ridiculous clause from the job\ndescriptions. This debate would not have been required\nif the President had accepted straightaway the changes that\nin the end he had to accept. I might as well just remind\nyou here and now that, having temporarily handed over\nthe Chair to the Honorary Secretary, it was I who proposed\nthe working which was finally agreed upon (unanimously,\nif I remember'correctly) and which allowed the meeting\nto proceed to the next item of business\u2014thus putting an\nend to the 'petty squabbling' which you found so\ndistasteful.\nWhile on the subject of debate, you say I 'should have\nfirst allowed debate on whether we needed such a drastic\nreorganisation of the Union'. I should like to point out\ntwo things:\n1. Nobody proposed a procedural motion to debate\nwhether the proposed changes were needed or not. The\nnecessity or otherwise of the changes was not even\nmentioned, not even by the permanent observer at Council.\nGiven this, I cannot force debate on the subject! As\nChairman, I have no influence on what subjects get\ndebated. I am only there to run the meeting and to try\nto ensure that everyone gets a fair chance to make their\nvoice heard.\n2. As it was, the meeting lasted over three and a half\nhours, and regrettably there is a limit to the amount of\ntime that Council members are prepared to sit and debate.\nFortunately for all concerned, the new job descriptions\ndo not become effective until next year. Wonder of\nwonders, there are still not one, nor two, but three whole\nCouncils left this year in which the job descriptions can\nbe amended and re-amended until everyone is happy with\nthem. Who knows, we might even want to re-adopt the\nold ones.\nOn a different note altogether, we have not created a sabbatical to run entertainments. Anyone who reads the\nnew job description carefully will realise that the Honorary\nSecretary (Events) brief requires him/her to 'assist in the\ncoord in tion of Entertainments for the Union in cooperation\nwith the Entertainments Officer and the Entertainments\nCommittee', and to 'assist in the coordination of Rag in\ncooperation with the Rag Chairman and the Rag\nCommittee'. This does not mean that we are going to\nabolish the post of Ents Officer, who will still be\nresponsible for Ents; nor does it mean that we have created\na sabbatical to run Entertainments.\nYours very sincerely\nAlastair J Seymour, UGM Chairman.\nSycophantic drivel\nDear Judith,\nI'd like to write to show my appreciation of the Imperial\nCollege Radio service whose broadcasts I listen to\nregularly. The information of student life provided is only\nsecond to the excellent choice of music one hears, despite\nthe limited resources and funds, I hear, they have. I'd particular like to show my appreciation of one disc jockey, Spenser Lane, who provides an amusing Monday morning\nbreakfast show. Keep it up!\nHowever, not to be seen to be too much of a flatterer,\ntwo disc jockeys do shows which show a don't care-about-the-audience policy. This whiny fa male and all too jovial\nsounding Welshman should think more about the populace,\nfor their sake s.I can see IC Radio going from strength to strength in\nthe following years from this staid start.\nYours faithfully,\nDavid Leigh (Physics 1).\nThat's what it meant\nDear Judith,\nI think somebody should shed some light on the\ncompletely incomprehensible letter at the end of last\nweek's FELIX. The letter, written by an anonymous\nTizard resident is concerned with a section of UVR &\nDDL in the last issue of Broadsheet. The extract is as\nfollows:\n'Tizard Hall have started up their own radio station-Radio Bonk. This basically boils down to some pervert\nplacing a microphone and transmitter in someone's room,\nwhile that someone is enjoying someone else! There are\nplans to extend the radio coverage to away matches in\nLinstead Hall. This station is rumoured to be found on\nabout 100m MW on Southside only.'\nThe person in charge of operating this obscene radio\nstation is said to be Neil Humphreys (Physics 1) or gru mph to his a quaint ances. It is rumoured that he and the illiterate\nletter writer are one and the same person. All I can find\nout about Grumph is that he was involved in a three-in-bed orgy with his teddy bear and his pillow, and that his\nhairstyle rivals that of Gordan Brignal. Well I would like\nto apologise to Grumph the pervert for my minor misprint\non the matter of radio frequency, and I can only hope that\nhis frequency of washing increases by a couple of\nmega-hertz.\nLove,\nCount J Dracula.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publication Board and is printed by the Imperial College\nUnion Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London, SW7 2BB( Tel 01-589 5111 ext 3515).

All games are\non Saturday February 6th with 3pm kick offs.\nQPR vs Charlton\nLoftus Road (White City tube)\nA match between two teams who have\nplayed West Ham in the Cup this\nyear. QPR are fresh from their Cup\nwin last week and seem to have\nregained some of the form that took\nthem to the top of the league earlier\nthis year. They have a dirty player of\nthe name of Gavin Maguire to watch\nout for and a new Israeli international\ndefender in David Pizanti. Charlton\nstill sit at the foot of the table and I can't really see them getting anything\nout of this game. Let us hope that this\nweek the QPR home game finishes at\n4.45pm and not an hour later! Last\nweek was a farce, with the ticket\nforgers the only ones coming out on\ntop. QPR to win quite easily.\nWimbledon vs Newcastle\n(Wimbledon Park tube)\nPlough Lane plays host to a game\nbetween the in-form Dons and the\nunpredictable Magpies. Fashanu\u2014or\nFash the Flash to his friends\u2014is in\nform with 17 goals so far this season\nand a \u00a31 million rating looks quite a bargain. Will he join brother Justin\nin becoming the first brothers to have\na \u00a31 million tag? Newcastle hit Lou\nMacari's Swindon for five last week\nwith Paul Gascoigne netting two. At\ncomic relief time it is a relief to know\nthat there is still a comic left in\nfootball. (Did you see Saint and\nGreavsie last week?) This game could\ngo either way so I 'll do a David Owen\nand sit on the fence and not tell you\nwhich way my money is going.\nCrystal Palace vs Birmingham\nSelhurst Park (Norwood Jtn BR)\nThis should be quite a good game.\nPalace are having a good season and\nonly a silly result last week at Oldham\nprevented them from being second in\nthe second (confused?). Bright and\nWright are still doing the business,\nit's41 so far between them.\nBirmingham are in the last 16 of the\nCup and striker Steve Wigley could\ngum up the works along with\nmidfielder Ian Handysides, a handy\nman to have on anyone's side. Palace\nshould return to winning ways and\njustify their high position.\nMillwall vs Bradford City\nThe Den (New Cross tube)\nMy old favourites Millwall play stage\nto what could be the game of the day\nin London against fellow promotion\nhopefuls Bradford. That man\nCascarino with 16 goals to his name\ncould hold the key. Bradford smashed\nMaxwell United, I mean Oxford, in\nthe Cup last week and are a dangerous\nside. A striker named Hendrie netted\none of the goals. What a versatile\nchap he is, playing snooker in his\nspare time and then helping the\nnortherners to reach the last 16.\nMillwall look to have the edge in this\ngame with a21 victory seeming the\nsort of result to expect.\nFulham vs Mansfield\nCraven Cottage (Putney Bdg tube)\nOnce again Fulham are entertaining\na side in the lower reaches of Division\n3. Old 18 goal Leroy Rosenoir is still\n18 goal Rosenoir and a51 defeat last\nweek for Fulham doesn't exactly\ninject any enthusiasm into a deflated\nside. Mansfield gave Wimbledon a good game last week and a21 defeat\nwas respectable. Mansfield have a striker called Stringfellow on their\nbooks and he could club it to Fulham\nif given the chance. Fulham to win.\nLeyton Orient vs Hartlepool\nBrisbane Road (Leyton tube)\nThe Eastenders face the NorthEastenders in this Division 4 clash.\nOrient led Forest last week and at\ntimes it was hard to tell which was\nthe 1st Division team. It would have\nbeen nice if Orient had made it further\nin the Cup, but now they must\nconcentrate on promotion. Hartlepool\nhave players on their books called\nNobbs and Tinkler, so what more\nneeds to be said. Orient should wrap\nup the game by half-time and let us\nhope that the scoreboard is working.\nFootball is a funny old game and I got\n2 out of 7 predictions right two weeks\nago and none right last week. The\nstandard predictor does about as well,\nso I should toss a three sided coin if\nI were you.\nGame of the day:\n\\Millwall vs Bradford\nFELIX Friday February 5th198810 "

    "content": "\u2022 THE UNION has been hit with a new scandal this week. Or, perhaps,\nthat should read old scandal but new\nnews. Ian Howgate, who even\nmanages to out-ego his Deputy Alan\nRose, has declared that he has already\nchosen his successor and is busy\nsettling him into the Presidential seat.\nMaybe Ian hasn't heard of\ndemocracy? Maybe we ought to point\nout to him that his successor will be\nelected by all the members of the\nUnion in a College-wide ballot. And\njust who is Ian's blue-eyed boy? I can\nreveal exclusively that Nigel Baker,\nthis year's Rag Chairman, and Ian had\ndinner together with College\nSecretary John Smith on Monday\nnight. Now what could such a College\nsupremo want to talk about that has\nanything to do with Rag?\n\u2022 IT SEEMS THAT Mr Howgate is\nnot content with just selecting his\nsuccessor. Many Union Officers have\nnoticed that Mr Howgate has created\na new Union post for himself next\nyear. I hereby announce that Mr\nHowgate will stand for Constitution\nand Policy Officer 1988-89. How can\nI be so certain? Why else would he\nhave included in the job description:\nchairing UGM and Council meetings;\nensuring that Officers follow his\nunderstanding of Union Constitution\nand Policy; bringing to the attention\nof the executive any matters that may\nrequire policy to be initiated; and,\nmore importantly, representing the\nUnion on the Governing Body and\nFinance & Executive committees as\nan observer. Could this be why Ian's been so pally with College recently?\nSurely no observers are allowed on\nGoverning Body or F&E? Surely no\nfull-time students can afford to miss\nlectures in order to attend such\ncommittees?\nDoes Ian really think we're all that\nstupid?\n\u2022 WHO HAS the biggest feet in\nCollege? IndSoc Chairman Gary\nMonaghan must be a leading\ncontender with his size 13s. Said gentle green giant Gary in his\nlilting Irish accent: 'Size isn't important and I haven't had any\ncomplaints so far.'\n'I'm not wearing one of those' said Derek\n'I don't want to look silly for my meeting\nwith all the important people at\nCheapskate'.\n'Oh yes you are' said Mad Dash\n'everyone else will be wearing one'.\n'Oh no they won't' said Derek.\n'Oh yes they will' said Mad.\n'Won't.' 'Will.'\n'Won't.' 'Will...'\nMeanwhile, in the Surefield Fortress, John Secretary, Arthur Michael,\nlain Bore and some other notables were waiting for Derek to arrive at the\nmeeting.\n'Right' said John Secretary, 'does everybody know the words?'.\n'Yes John' they all replied.\n'What if he isn't wearing one?' whispered Arthur Michael, the good but\ngood-for-nothing fairy.\n'I 've spoken to Mad Dash and she assures me that he'll be wearing one.\nWe start singing as soon as he comes in.'\nJust then the door handle moved and Derek entered the room. Before\nhe could say as much as 'hello' the assembled rabble broke into song:\n'Derek the Red-Nose Baron\nHad a very shiny nose, , \u201e \u2014\nAnd if you ever saw it\nYou would even say it glowed.\nAll of the Cheapskate citizens\nUsed to laugh and call him names.\nThey never let poor Derek\nJoin in all their citizens games.\nThen one snowy white night\nMaggie came to say,\n'Derek with your nose so bright\nYou look like a Kinnockite'.\n'Cheapskate will get no money\nBecause you're not true blue,\nI don't like troublemakers,\nAnd that irt clude s you!'\nThen how the Citizens loved him,\nThey danced and jumped around with glee\nThis was the end of Cheapskate\nAll because of Comic Relief!\"\nJohn Secretary, Arthur Michael, lain Bore et al rolled about on the floor\nafter this performance and Derek went bright red. He didn't need his red\nnose now!\nMeanwhile, in the Lumpsofmetalworshippers temple Dave Braincell was\nmuch more enthusiastic. 'Great, with one of these red noses on I 'll look\nlike a real clown!'\nBraincell needed to improve his clown image. In a recent opinion poll\nin Lumpsofmetalsheet lots of citizens had said that Braincell wasn'ta very\ngood clown and this made Braincell very unhappy. At first he thought about\nstopping being a clown for good, then just for a week, but then he decided\nthat he was a born clown so he should stay. (That's why he was chosen\nto be a part-time Action Man and to take part in the odd game of shoot y shoot y bang bangs.)\nTonight was to be the highlight of the Lumpsofmetalworshippers social\ncalendar, Dungeons and Dragons. Braincell was going to wear his red nose\nfor the whole evening to remind everyone that he was a clown, and a very good clown at that. (If he wore only a red nose then he'd certainly\nget a lot of laughs!)\nWill Dave Braincell get a lot of laughs?\nWhat are Maggie's plans for Cheapskate?\nHow many election candidates does it take to change a light bulb?\nWhy hasn't anyone sent me any money yet?\nWhy did Largeamounts get three red noses?\nWhy so many questions?\nFind out in the next episode of the Baron of Cheapskate.\n\u2022 I SPEND MOST of my column\ninches each week on IC Radio and it's various characters. Latest news to\nreach my ears is that of long-time\nhack and PG Prospectus Editor Alan\nBarnett who shares a flat with ICR\nPrimadonna Nige 'sweetie' Whitfield\nand Simon 'Nancy-boy' Bradshaw.\nPoor Alan, having been targeted as\nmy ICR mole, has had his own dirt\ndug up. It seems that all they could\ncome up with was that Al seems to\nbe conducting a long and passionate\nlove affair with his trusty coat. Nige\nand Si inform me that he even wears\nhis parka in bed. We at FELIX have\nclubbed together to pay for it to be\ndry-cleaned at least once in its poor,\npathetic lifetime!\n\u2022 EDITOR JUDITH gets my\nsympathetic vote this week. Her\nboyfriend took her bunch of keys\nhome with him to Surrey by mistake\non Tuesday night. Judith couldn't leave the FELIX office, couldn't get\nto the phone, couldn't get into her\nroom. Somehow, though she was\nguarded about exactly how, she\nmanaged to inform her boyfriend that\nhe had the keys and he valient ly caught a series of night buses back to\nsave the day\u2014or should that be night?\nThe doctor says that he should be\nable to walk again in two weeks time.\n\u2022 WHY DID Ian Howgate want to\nNo Confidence U GM Chairman\nAlastair Seymour? And why did he\noffer the job to Holbein trouble-maker\nChris Stapleton? My reliable source\ntells me that Ian hatched a plan to oust\nMr Seymour at 1.30am one morning\nby persuading ring-leaders of the\ninfamous Holbein social club, Beans,\nto challenge the Chairman's ruling at\nlast month's Union General\nMeeeting. If the challenge was\nsuccessful, Mr Seymour would have\nhad to pass the Chair on to Mr\nHowgate, who would in turn have his\nruling challenged. Mr Howgate\nwould then pass the Chair onto Mr\nStapleton and propose a motion of No\nConfidence in Mr Seymour.\nConfused yet? If the motion was\npassed then Mr Howgate was to\npropose that Mr Stapleton be made\nthe new U GM Chairman. The plan\nfell through when Mr Seymour got a tip off from a friend and confronted\nMr Howgate with the fact that he\ncould quite as easily No Confidence\nIan on stronger grounds than Ian's No\nConfidence of him. Naturally Mr\nHowgate let sleeping dogs lie.\nFELIX Friday February 5th19886 "

    "content": "How\nnumbers\ntell fibs\nI have not yet heard an honest statistic\nused in the political slang ing match\nover the state of the health service.\nOops, sorry, the previous sentence is\na serious sentence, but the rest of this\npage is less serious, and I only\nmention the Health Service because:\n(a) there is a cartoon about it at the\nbottom of this page; and (b) because\nit provides some sort of topical\nintroduction to what I am going to talk\nabout, which is the misuse of\nstatistics, and how it can be fun.\nStatistically, the previous sentence\nis completely unreadable, as it\ncontains 67 words (well it did when\nI wrote it), some of which are long\nwords. There is a formula called the\nFlesch Readability Formula, which\njudges readability by the length of\nwords and sentences and other such\nthings: according to it, most of what\nI write is complete gobbledygOok.\nHowever, I take comfort from the fact\nthat the same formula rates The\nLegend of Sleepy Hollow as one-and-a half times more difficult than Plato's Republic. I only mention it because\nit neatly sums up the stupidity of\nassigning single' numbers to\ncomplicated entities.\nNumbers can cause a sort of\nparalysis in the part of the brain that\ndeals with common sense, this applies\nUNDER MICRO THE by Steve Black\nespecially to apparently precise\nnumbers. Imagine you are claiming\ntravel expenses and you lost your\nreceipts. You could claim for 'about'\n\u00a325, which might be all you can\nremember. If you do, the claim is\nlikely to be queried, and you will be\nasked to find the receipts: accountants\nhate approximate figures. However,\nif you claimed for \u00a325.32, you would\nprobably get the money straight away:\nthe precision gives the illusion that\nyou calculated the figures exactly. I do this all the time and it seems to\nwork. So do the people who advertise\ncars: a figure of 52.3 miles-per-gallon\nprobably applies to only one car tested\nunder arbitrarily unrealistic\nconditions.\nAnother example is the op in on poll\n(perhaps the most abused statistic in\ncreation). They are accurate (given a typical sample size of about 1,000) to\nabout plus or minus 2%. That is, if\na party has the support of 25.1% of\nthe poll sample, all that we can really\nbe confident about is that somewhere\nbetween 23 and 27 % of the population\nsupport them. During the last election\nabout 62% of newspaper headlines\nwere about trends in opinion polls.\nMore than 68% of them were based\non nothing more than statistical\nfluctuations (actually I made those\ntwo exact percentages up, just to test\nyour credulity, but they are about\nright). Never believe a newspaper\nheadline based on a statistic (unless\nof course it proclaims Statistical\nFluctuation Gives Labour The Lead).\nBut numbers have nothing on\npictures when it comes to effect. If\nyou want to exaggerate a case, use a graph. If you have a slight trend that\nyou want to exaggerate, you can chop\noff the appropriate axis and stretch it\nout to fill a page. This can make any\nsmall advance (in company profits or\nwhatever) look like the north face of\nthe Eiger. This is a common\ntechnique in advertising, where\ngraphs are like being hit by a bus: it\nisn't the numbers that count, it's the\nimpact.\nHowever, if you really want to have\nfun with statistics, you have to\nextrapolate. Take the world\npopulation growth up to the early\nsixties. Do a sophisticated statistical\nanalysis to fit it to a mathematical\nmodel. The result you get is a prediction of infinite world population\nsome time early in the 22nd century.\nThis is, of course, nonsense. But it\nis no worse than the sort of figures\nused by the Department of Transport\nto predict traffic levels on the M25,\nexcept that they underestimated the\ntrend. In fact, the world population\nmodel, though clearly ridiculous, has\nfitted the actual figures for the last\ntwenty years better than any\nalternative. Some people would get\nworried about this.\nMark Twain once wrote something\nappropriate:\n'In the space of one hundred and\nseventy-six years the lower\nMississippi has shortened itself about\ntwo hundred and forty-two miles.\nThat is an average of a trifle over one\nmile and a third per year. Therefore,\nany calm person, who is not blind or\nidiotic, can see that in the Old Oolitic\nSilurian period, just a million years\nago next November, the Lower\nMississippi was upward of one\nmillion three hundred thousand miles\nlong, and stuck out over the Gulf of,\nMexico like a fishing rod. And by the j same token any person can see that I seven hundred and forty-two years!\nfrom now the Lower Mississippi will i be only a mile and three-quarters J long, and Cairo and New Orleans will\nhave joined their streets together, and\nwill be plodding comfortably along\nunder a single mayor and a mutual\nboard of aldermen. There is\nsomething fascinating about science.\nOne gets such wholesale returns of\nconjecture out of such a trifling\ninvestment of fact.'\nHow to Lie with Statistics is written\nby Darrell Hugg and published by\nPenguin. Join the trend: more people\nuse it every year.\nScience Editor in Statistical\nNightmare\nStatistics show that I will never get\nmy thesis written up if someone else\ndoesn't start writing for this column.\nI want your contributions. They can\nbe short, long, news, features, abuse,\nsingle words (if they are long\nenough), in fact absolutely anything\nthat has the slightest connection with\nscience.\nAL6ERT THE EXPERIMENTAL RAT and Trie Hospitals ot~ Doom\nWE \\/\u00a3 $OT A JOB FROM THE\nNHS, INVESTtQATINq.,,\n, .

    "content": "or* Tennis\n*9F The fifth event in the new year was\nan 'O Cross' at Wisley, just off the\nA3. An O Cross can be considered as\na one person relay. The meh J completed a10 km course consisting\nof 3 different loops of approximately\n3km. The women completed a similar\nkind of course of 5.5km. This kind\nof event is unique to any others in that\nthere is a mass start providing a much\nmore competitive air. The weather\nstayed fine but it was bitterly cold.\nPreparations are already underway\nfor the British Student Championships\nin North Yorkshire and the JK International event both held during\nEaster.\nArchery\nIC Mixed\u20142\nSchool of Pharmacy Mixed\u20145\nFollowing my last report in FELIX,\nI 've been commissioned to write this\nweek's offering. The game was\nplayed in Burnswick Square on a kiddies play g our nd, but that's another\nstory. Suffice to say that the first half\nwas competitive and attacking, on a very small pitch. Each team had many\nscoring chances and IC were at their\nlethal best; the result 0-0 at half-time.\nThe second half started with two\ngoals inside a minute, Mark Lewis\nand Debbie Tucker were responsible\nand Schaun Westfinnishedboth goals\noff, unfortunately both goals were\nscored by SOP. After this the flood\ngates opened and goals went in at both\nends, but IC never quite recovered\nfrom their explosive start.\nPerson of the match for IC was\nJohn Spencer who had a magnificent\ngame playing right half for SOP who\nonly had 10 players at the beginning\nof the game.\nSnooker\nFriday morning and the first of the\nfencers arrives feeling very dizzy\n(claims he's got an ear infection!).\nAdam arrives just on time saying that\nhe's had a good night's sleep and no\nhangover (highly unlikely). We set off\non time on the three hour drive to\nBath with the usual competition\nnerves.\nToday's the e pee individual with\nthree competitors from Imperial\u2014two\nvery experienced for the men and one\ncomplete beginner for the ladies.\nFavourites are Richard Gore,\ninternational fencing at home, or\nPeter and Adam (if one didn't have\nan ear infection and the other had a hangover) and UCL who have a very\nstrong team all round.\nArriving in Bath with ten minutes\nto spare, and with some skillful\nnavigation from the lads, we managed\nto get lost, despite the fact that the\nuniversity is signposted all the way!\nPanic over, we changed for a late\nstart. The competition is arranged as\npools of six with three promoting.\nFights are first to five. The men'se pee kicked off an hour late and our\ntwo got through the first round with\nno hassle.\nMeanwhile the ladies' e pee, well\nsupported as ever, starts with only\ntwo pools of five! I start my pool in\nthe Ladies' e pee without a much\nneeded warm-up lesson. This is only\nmy third experience of e pee ever. The\nfirst round of the ladies e pee finishes\nand so ends my second e pee competition. But at least I'm not last\nand I 've got my first e pee victory\nunder my belt.\nI now busy my s lef cheering the\nothers on through the quarter finals\nand into the semis. This is where our\nluck starts to change. Adam is very\nunlucky with his first two fights losing\n9-8 and 10-9. (This high score is due\nto the fact that double hits can be\nscored in e pee.) He fails to regain his\nearlier form and sadly goes out. By\nthis time it's getting late and if we\nleave now we could reach home by\nmidnight. Unfortunately, Peter is\ndoing much better despite his 'ear\ninfection', and gets into the final\nhaving only lost his balance once.\nFatigue is really starting to set in now\n(Peter's quite tired too).\nAn hour or so later having drowned\nAdam's sorrows, Peter comes third\noverall in the e pee and is selected to\nrepresent the U AU the following\nweekend. At last we can head off back\nto London. Eventually having\ndelivered everyone to their homes, I hit the sack at 1.30am and set the\nalarm for 5.15am, ready for an early\nstart back to Bath for the foil.\nResults\u2014Mens Epee:\n1st Richard Gore (Bath)\n2nd Adrian Griffiths (UCL)\n3rd Peter Cripwell (IC)\nSurfing\nVK Acton Impulse\u20143\nImperial College 1\n15-8, 15-11, 12-15, 15-10\nWhat can you say? One match after\ndefeating the league leaders, Imperial\nmet the third team in the table, Acton\nImpulse, a strong collection of casual\nplayers, many of whom have played\nfor IC in the past. Many excuses can,\nand will, be made for this\nperformance. Acton fielded a guest\nstar from the London Youth Team in\nthe enormous but athletic form of\nDonald 'Honey Monster' Deans, and\nhis presence seemed to inspire the rest\nof the squad. Imperial were sorely\nmissing captain Filippos Frangulis\nand his crocodile, Palookaville, and\nas for the referee....well, if looks\ncould kill (Imperial are a disciplined\nteam, y 'know) then he would be dead\nmeat. If this sounds like sour grapes,\nthen that is precisely what it is.\nThe truth of the matter is that Acton\nsimply were the better team on the\nday. Imperial looked as tired as the\nclich es in this article after the fixture\nthree days before against Varsovia,\nand never really found their feet. The\nback court play was not up to the\nmark, and opportunities were lost by\nbad serving. Altogether a slack\nperformance, and hopefully one that\nwill not be repeated.\nRacing\nLondon Sabres\u20146\nImperial College\u20148\nWith a crucial UAU outdoor game the\nfollowing day, Tuesday night saw a potentially weakened IC indoor side\nmatched against league and cup\nchampions London Sabres. After a feeling out period, Sabres were the\nfirst to score. An instant reply,\nprovided by Mark Vamadevan, was\nvital for the IC side's confidence.\nSabres then retook the lead, were\nlevelled and then scored again\nthrough a penalty. Were it not for the\ndefensive play of brave goalie Simon\nChittenden and full backs Andy Lewis\nand Mark Rayfield, the game would\nhave been lost by the internal.\nHowever, Vamadevan put the teams\non a second half par with a brilliant\ndribbled goal beating both timing\nbuzzer and goalkeeper. Chittenden\nsaving numerous short corners and\ntwo penalties, IC were trailing 6-4\nwith only ten minutes to play. At this\npoint the IC turbo charger (in the\nform of diminutive Andy Lewis) cut\nin. Inspired from the back\nVamadevan, Mark Lewis and Fitter\nall scored again (totals 4, 2 and 2\ngoals respectively) to force an\nexcellent 8-6 win.\nBaseball\nLast Sunday, despite extremely strong\ngales gusting to force six at times, the\nintrepid IC Sailing Club team went to\nthrash the living daylights out of the\nCity University team. So keen were\nIC, that they arrived an hour before\nCity did. Having watched the white\ncapped waves washing over the club\nhouse steps, the teams set forth into\nthe storm.\nThe wind bit hard into the sails as\nthe first race was started with a bang.\nAs the sturdy little vessels steamed\ntowards the first buoy, the boats\nkeeled over with the crews' noses\ninches from the foaming water. With\ndefeat only inches away from the City\nteam only drastic measures could save\nthem and they rammed our star boat.\nBoth capsized and all that could be\nseen behind the upturned IC boat was\nApe's cap floating into the distance.\nDue to the courage and fortitude of\nJenny Burton, the crew, he was pulled\nfrom amongst the wreckage to live to\nwin the race.\nHaving returned to land to refit the\nboats, the racing continued. Paul\nRobbins was hero of the next race by\ncarefully plotting the course his helm\nshould sail, to lead them to victory.\nIn the final race, with the score 3-3\nCity in the final desperate bid to win,\nthrew IC crew member Sam Page into\nthe waves, leaving her to swim to the\nrescue boat and still IC managed to\nwin. Grateful thanks to Sam Page,\nJenny Burton and Paul Robbins\nwithout whom victory would have\nbeen impossible.\n13 Friday February 5th1988 FELIX\n\n"

Both parties are said to be\n'very happy' with the deal, which will\nbe put into practice on Good Friday\nthis year.\nThe painting is being kept in a secret location in the heart of South\nKensington and has been mortgaged\nto a value sufficient to pay for the\nprinting and typesetting of FELIX for\nthe rest of this year. The loan will be\npaid off when the painting is sold and\nthe remainder spent on a holiday in\nBarbados for the FELIX Editor, plus\na sun lamp for the FELIX Office.\nWhen questioned about the\nagreement Ms Hackney, aged 22, said\nT didn't know what had hit me. It was\nlike a bolt from the blue.'\nWhen she had recovered from the\nshock, she explained that the decision\nhad been taken when the printing\npress broke down for the fifteenth\ntime in ten days.

Box 4721, Philadelphia, Pa\nFrom the files of Richard Spanner ARCS\nIt was a December morning towards the end\nof July, from my window I saw people\nrushing back and forth like people who didn't want to be written into a tacky story; I wasn't going to give them the satisfaction. I walked\nover to my radio alarm, 9.26; damn! I was\ngonna be late! I turned it over in my mind,\nno good it still read 9.26. I walked into the\ndepartment; the lecturer was senile, he didn't know one end of a piece of chalk from the\nother, instead I decided to check out my\npigeonhole. The birds were still there; so\nwere a couple of notes both A sharp, I thought, but then decided they seemed to be\nflat. 'Spade, we gotta job for you\u2014\nthermometer theft' read the note (it was\ntalented even for aB flat). I was on a case,\nI headed straight for the RCSU.\nThere was the usual crowd of boring hacks\n(if you'll pardon the tautology) 'OK who was\nthe last one to see the the mo meter?' I asked.\nIt turned out to be this Williams guy who was\nusing it as a model for a cartoon strip in\nBroadsheet (the guy needed a model to draw\na thermometer.. .clearly he was as talented at\ndrawing as he was at handling finances). Wait\na moment, this William's guy was a candidate\nfor RCSU VP, if he showed he could handle\nmascot ry, there'd be no competition (not that\nthere was much now), I smelled a rat. My\nmistake, it turned out to be a dog turd. 'What\ndo you make of this McErlan?' I turned on\nthe President, T take it as a sign of the last\ntime this office was cleaned' she squealed\u2014\nmaybe I shouldn't have worn spiked shoes\nwhen I turned on her. I looked down at the\ndog turd in my hand, this was no way to be\nhandling the job.\n. The way I saw it, there were four main\n.groups of suspects, but then I always saw\nthings with a combination of tunnel and\ndouble vision, so that narrowed it down to\ntwo. The first group was a bunch of hardened\ncriminals\u2014Guilds, previous crimes included\nin descent exposure, driving without due care\nand attention and catnapping. The three main\nex-cons had shared a cell in the pen\u2014their\nleader Dave Tyler was the brains of that cell\n(at least I think that's what they said).\nSomehow though this lacked the military\nsubtlety of Tyler's other attempts on the the\nthermometer, employing tactics such as\nknocking on the door and asking for it or\nclaiming overwhelming numbers when he\nhimself can't count to four. The other group\nwas a club full of has-been s led by a small\ntime drunk and horse fixer. Their recent\nexploits included a raid on Guild's Office of\nsuch intelligence that it rivalled Dave Tyler's. Recently the syndicate had tried to swap the\nthermometer for a hippo, a move which was\nsnubbed by the recently signed mascot\nembargo agreement.\nAs I headed back to the office I was\nconfused. I walked in, my boss Hackney was\npasting-up that Friday's paper, I cast my eyes\nover page .... this upset the boss because it\ngot my optical jelly and retina over it, but now\nI'd cracked the case.\n'The Felix Office stole the thermometer\nI said.\n\"That's astounding' said the boss 'can I ask\na question?'\n'Sure, what is it?'\n'An inter og at ive statement used to gain or\ntest knowledge, but that's not important.
