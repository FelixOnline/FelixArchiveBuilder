It feels\na bit like taking a dive in\nfreezing water \u2013 exciting\nand slightly scary, as we\nconsider what the next\ntwelve months can bring.\nAbove all, it can be a\nchance to reflect on what\nwe\u2019ve learnt over the\nprevious twelve months,\nand bring some of those\nlessons into the year\nahead. So this year, I fully\nembraced my superstitious side, and arranged a\nsmall meal for a handful\nof friends, where we ate\nfood to bring good luck\nand see in the new year:\nlentils to bring wealth,\nnoodles to represent a\nlong life, pomegranates\nto encourage abundance,\nand even a galette de rois\nto determine which of us\nwould have the best year\nof all.\nIt was a lovely night,\nbut what made it really\nspecial was sharing it\nwith the people I love and\ncare about. It is in these\nrelationships that we find\nsolidarity. Community.\nFamily.And taking time to\nthink about how 2017 has\ntreated me, I\u2019ve come to\nrealise how much my life\nhas changed over the last\ntwelve months. This time\nlast year, I was planning\non running to be Felix\nEditor (something I\u2019d encourage anyone reading to\ndo, please.), and not sure\nwhether I\u2019d be chosen\nfor the role. Fast-forward\ntwelve months, and I\u2019m\nhere, on a Thursday\nevening, writing these\nwords, having just about\ngot the hang of how all\nthis works (maybe).\nBut, whether or not\nI\u2019ve managed to perfect\nthe art of the editorial\nyet, the biggest change\n2017 brought was the new\npeople I\u2019ve met, and the\nconnections I\u2019ve made.\nI spent today in an office\nscented with toasted\nbagels, whose kettle was\nboiled at regular intervals,\nprovided cups of tea and\ncoffee for a wide range\nof people \u2013 postgraduates\nand undergraduates, biologists and physicists \u2013 all\nbrought together by their\nlove for the paper.

It\u2019s\ne x c i t i n g ,\nadventurous, and a great\nway to discover new\ncultures. But sometimes,\ndue to time or price\nconstraints, that\u2019s not\nan option. In that case,\nwhy not take a holiday\nin our own motherland,\nthe United Kingdom? It\nhas many fantastic travel\noptions that we tend to\noverlook, so today I\u2019m\nhere to show you some\nof England\u2019s hidden\ntreasures.\nBristol\nBristol is one of those\ncities anyone will tell\nyou is inherently cool.\nAnd, long story short,\nthey\u2019re not wrong. I go\nthere at least once a year,\nand I know I can always\nexpect some relaxing,\nfun, hipster vibes, which\nis a nice change from the\nposh hustle and bustle\nin South Ken. It\u2019s ideal\nfor a weekend escape\nfrom the city, leaving on\na Friday afternoon and\ncoming back on Sunday,\nwell-rested and ready for\nmore Imperial deadlines.\nBut how do you fill that\nmagical weekend?\nLet\u2019s start with\nGloucester Street, one of\nthe coolest, hippest streets\nI\u2019ve been to. Reminiscent\nof London\u2019s Shoreditch\nbut much cheaper, it\u2019s\nfilled with independent\nrestaurants and thrift\nstores, where you can get\nthe cheapest and jazziest\nclothes. My personal\nfavourite is the Cats\nProtection store, where\nall sales go to aiding cat\nwelfare (I bought an acid\nwashed denim shirt and\nhelped animals all in one\n\u2013 you can\u2019t ask for more).\nThere\u2019s also a giant ware-house/thrift store at the\nend of the street, which\nis perfect for old records\nand discarded mannequin\nparts if that\u2019s what you\u2019re\ninto.\nFor lunch, St. Nicholas\nMarket is just five minutes\naway and offers a wide\nvariety of food stalls,\nranging from sausages to\nKorean food. Admittedly,\nsome of them are not the\ncheapest, but if you live\nin London you\u2019re used to\nit. Portions are quite large\nthough, so if you\u2019re smart\nand can control your\nappetite, you might have\ndinner sorted too.\nAs a student, you\u2019re\nprobably also wondering\nabout Bristol\u2019s nightlife,\nand \u2013 #spoileralert \u2013 it\ndoesn\u2019t disappoint. Start\nwith some cocktails at\nFlipside, with their 2-for-1\ndays, secret garden, and\npun-tastic drinks (\u201cGin ne\nsais quoi\u201d is genius). Or if\nyou\u2019re feeling fancy, Her\nMajesty\u2019s Secret Service\nis a cocktail bar whose\nentrance is disguised\nwithin a red telephone\nbooth. That says it all.\nOnce you\u2019re feeling\n\u2018happy\u2019, there are plenty\nof clubs you can check\nout: SWX is a student-fa-vourite, which boasts\nthree different music\nrooms and spacious dance\nfloors, so you can get as\ncrazy with your dance\nmoves as you want.\nThis brings me to my\nfavourite topic: sleep. In\nterms of accommoda-tion, they do have fancy\nhotels, like the Marriott\nand Hilton, and I\u2019m sure\nthere are many Airbnb\u2019s\navailable. But I recommend getting a friend who\nstudies at Bristol University and will let you sleep\nin their house for free.\nPlus, they\u2019ll know the\nins and outs of the city\nand can take you to cool\nplaces.\nIf you do go to Bristol,\nyou must visit the Clifton\nSuspension Bridge. It\u2019s\nthe Bristolians\u2019 proud\nbadge of honour, and\ndeservedly so. Situated in\nthe middle of a valley, this\ngiant bridge is an image\ntaken straight out of a\ntravel brochure, which\nwill leave you wide-eyed\nin wonder. There\u2019s a beautiful hill right beside it\nwhich proves a nice hike\nand provides a spectacular\nview of the bridge. You\ncan walk across the bridge\nduring the day and enjoy\nthe view of the river and\nthe valley, or go there at\nnight when it\u2019s beautifully\nilluminated and you can\nsee all the lights from the\ncity below (peaceful af).\nBut Bristol\u2019s charm\ndoes not lie only in these\ngreat locations.

Just\nwalk around its streets,\nbrowse some shops, and\nenjoy its casual atmos-phere. Everyone there\nseems happy and light,\nwhich is very contagious.\nStop at any of its great\ncafes, like the Boston Tea\nCompany, and enjoy a\nhot drink and a delicious\nscone (or your sweet treat\nof choice).\nIn short, go to Bristol\nfor a fun, carefree\nweekend, filled with fun\nand denim jackets.\nSurrey\nSurrey, and its main city\nGuildford, are great for a\nshort day trip and pretending you\u2019re from the rich\npart of England. It\u2019s super\neasy to get there: you can\ntake a train from Waterloo\nfor less than \u00a38 and be\nthere in half an hour. It\u2019s\nthe perfect distance: it\ndoesn\u2019t take ages to travel\nthere but still feels far\nenough that your worries\nwon\u2019t matter.\nI recommend getting\nthere around midday,\nsince there\u2019s no rush.\nThe station is right next\nto the main city area, so\nyou can literally get off\nthe train and straight into\nthe city. There are three\nmain streets, all lined with\nany shop you can think\nof, so be ready to browse\nsome clothes or books\nand comment on how bad\ninflation is getting. It\u2019s\nalso very easy to find a\nbeautiful scenery and\nfresh air (which is ironic\nbecause it used to be the\nUK\u2019s industrial centre).\nSince it\u2019s so far away, you\nshould probably compare\ntrain and plane tickets to\nsee which is cheaper for\nyour preferred date. In\nmy case, I bought train\ntickets about a month in\nadvance and spent around\n\u00a380 (which is slightly\nexpensive but sometimes\nyou need to treat yo\u2019 self).\nOnce you\u2019re there, get\nready to enjoy the city\u2019s\nopen spaces and impressive architecture. And I\nmean impressive. Every\nsingle building is excellently conserved, and\nsome look like Gringotts\nWizarding Bank itself.\nSpeaking of architecture,\nthey are also particularly\nproud of their bridges, of\nwhich there are seven:\nsome of them are true architectural feats spanning\nthe River Tyne. They\u2019re\nsimilar to the Thames\u2019\nmultiple bridges, each\ndifferent and special in its\nInstagram aficionados, it\nhas a fifth floor viewing\narea where you can see\nthe entire city beneath\nyou, with the river and its\nmany bridges on the side.\nI obviously took several\npictures.\nSurrey is for the ones craving a quieter weekend break // Daniel Corredera Nadal\nnice place to eat, although\nit might be hard to decide\nsince they all look so good.\nI went to this lovely pub in\nthe town centre with great\npigeon decorations and\nnice vegan burgers \u2013 what\nmore do you want?\nIf you have the time\nand are not fed up of uni-versities, go have a look at\nthe University of Surrey.\nIt has a completely different vibe from Imperial\n(people are not running\naroundstressedoutoftheir\nminds and crippled by the\nweight of their deadlines),\nwhich is interesting to see.\nThey even have a park on\ncampus with a beautiful\nlake and benches to sit\non and think about life.\nHere\u2019s some Surrey inside\nknowledge and a possible\nspoiler alert: the lake is\nactually fake, built based\non a CivEng students\u2019\nproject.

I\nwent in December so I\u2019m\nbiased, but the light decorations and the Christmas\nmarket made it very jolly\nand inviting. Five minutes\naway is the beautiful\nSunday market, which\nhas dozens of little stands\nselling very interesting\nobjects. I particularly\nremember a shop selling\nwooden plaques, each\nfashioned after a different\ndog breed.

However, in\nrecent years, scientists\nhave developed compelling theories to propose\na genetic basis to ageing,\nimplying a means to\neither avoid or delay the\nprocess. Nonetheless, new\nscientific evidence shows\nthat ageing is, in fact,\ninevitable!\nConsider natural selec-tion, a concept where individuals that are \u2018fitter\u2019 are\nmore likely to reproduce.\nWith more offspring, the\ngenes that are responsible\nfor \u2018fitness\u2019 are selected\nand amplified over time.\noffspring. This \u2018selection\nshadow\u2019 for organisms\nthat pass their reproductive age permits genes that\ncontribute to late-stage\ndeleterious effects to be\npassed on. These genes\nare termed \u2018longevity\ngenes\u2019 and it was believed\nthat, by manipulating\nthese genes, slowing\nageing was no longer an\nimpossible task.\nTo understand these\nlongevity genes, scientists\nhave studied ageing in\nvarious organisms at\na cellular level. It was\npostulated that \u2018garbage\u2019,\nlike misfolded proteins,\nneeds to be removed from\na cell for normal function.\nFailure to do so results\nin cell malfunctioning\nand senescence. This is\nparticularly enhanced in\nsingle-celled organisms,\nwhere there is intercellu-lar competition between\nsomatic cells: the more\nefficient the cell-garbage\nremoval processes are, the\nlonger the cell lives.\nComparably, in a multicellular organism, similar\nto you and I, intercellular\ncompetition is also occur-ring. Since we need our\ncells to work with each\nother to serve a larger\nfunction (e.g. muscle cells\nwork together to form\na muscle tissue, which\ncan contract and allow\nmovement), removal of\nnon-cooperative cells is an\nimportant task to maintain\nthe organism\u2019s fitness.\nThus, it is imperative to\nweed out non-functioning\ncells that do not work well\ntogether. Additionally,\nintercellular competition\nis constantly occurring,\nwhere cells which are\nunable to grow as well\nas their counterparts are\neliminated, whilst highly\nfunctioning cells, with\nhigher proliferative rate,\nare selected.\nare still allowed to grow.\nConsider cancer cells that\nout-compete other cells in\nthe region despite having\nzero benefits to the host\norganism. To eliminate\ncancer, the extent of inter-cellular competition must\nbe reduced, and this eventually leads to the decline\nin cellular cooperation\nand the subsequent ageing\nprocess.\nBy studying fruit flies\nand worms, evidence that\nsupports this notion was\nshown, where intercellu-lar competition prevents\naccumulation of ageing\ncells at the expense of\ncancerous cell growth.\nVice versa, a delay of\nintercellular competition\ncauses a loss of functional\ncells, therefore cells\ndon\u2019t cooperate as well\nas before. This evidence\nsuggests that ageing is an\ninevitable part of living.\nNevertheless, this topic\nis under ongoing investi-gation. By studying and\ncomparing the degree of\nintercellular competition\nin different species, the\nprocess of ageing could\nbe understood better, and\nperhaps, in the future, be\ndelayed!\nDOI: 10.1073/\npnas.1618854114\nARE YOU INTERESTED IN\nPARTICIPATING IN RESEARCH?\nAt Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in West\nLondon we are interested in finding out the effects of\nhormones that control reproduction.\nWe are looking for healthy men (who do not\nsmoke and do not take any medication) aged\nbetween 18 and 40 years.

Currently,\norgan supply is filled\nwith altruistic donations,\nbut there is also a black\nmarket for organs; though\nillegal and unethical, this\nindustry is very much\npresent, especially in developing countries such as\nIndia, China, and Nepal.\nRecent developments\nin medical science could\ntackle these issues with\none example being\nadditive manufacturing\n\u2013 commonly known as\n3D printing \u2013 which may\nallow for bioprinting\nof organs! Through\nthis process, an organ\ncan be designed using\na modelling software,\nand then printed with\nbiomaterials such as\npolymers and hydrogels,\nin addition to the patient\u2019s\nown cells. 3D-printed\norgans, if successfully\nproduced, could tackle\n\u201cWhile the use\nof 3D printing\nis ambitious,\nit could be a\nrevolutionary\nchange for\nhealthcare\u201d\n\u201cWhile there\nare ethical\nconcerns,\nothers are\nworried about\nan economic\ndivide\u201d\nthe big three obstacles in\norgan transplants: patient\nwait time, financial and\nemotional distress, and\nimmunological failure.\nCurrently, 3D bioprinting\nhas a significant presence\nin customized implants,\nprosthetics, and working\nmodels for simulating the\neffect of drug treatments\noutside the human body.\nWhile the use of 3D\nprinting to eliminate the\ncrushing deficit of organ\nsupply is ambitious, it\ncould be a revolutionary\nchange for the healthcare\nindustry \u2013 extending\npeople\u2019s lives, as well as\ntheir productivity.\nExperts in this field,\nhowever, have issued\ncaution against keeping\nhopes too high. Jennifer\nLewis, a bioengineer at\nHarvard University, is\npositive about the developments but suggests that\nthe complicated architecture of organs such as\nlivers and kidneys means\nbioprinting is unlikely\nto be plausible solution\nin the immediate future.\nAnother expert in 3D\nbioprinting, Dr. Anthony\nAtala, director of theWake\nForest Institute for regenerative medicine, has a\nmore positive outlook:\nhe has successfully led a\nproject to grow a human\nbladder using bioprinting\nand transplanted it to\nseven young patients suffering from spina bifida,\na condition which can\ncause bladder problems.\nHe has also set his eyes\non bioprinting kidneys\n\u2013 one of the organs most\ncommonly in demand. In a\nseminal TED talk in 2011,\nhe displayed a kidney\nwhich had been printed\non a machine earlier that\nday. But while the talk\nwas a smashing success\nit also invited heavy\ncriticism: the kidney was\nan artificial model and not\nfunctional, and he was\naccused of misleading the\naudience. According to\nLewis, though the science\nis progressing in the right\ndirection, it is still a long\nway from providing real\nassurances to patients in\nneed.\nAt present, many\nscientists are debating\nthe actual potential of 3D\nbioprinting however, with\na number of companies\ntrying to make it commercially viable. Cellink, a\nSwedish based company\nfounded last year,\ndevelops new biomaterial\nas \u201cink\u201d for 3D bioprint-ers. With customers in 25\ncountries across the world\n\u2013 including researchers\nat MIT, Harvard, and\nUniversity College\nLondon \u2013 its success story\nexplains the fact that they\nhave enlisted for an Initial\nPublic Offering (IPO),\nbecomingapubliclytraded\ncompany just ten months\nafter being founded. It\u2019s a\nnoteworthy achievement,\nwhich exemplifies the\nmarket potential of organ\nbio-printing. Organovo is\na much older name in this\nfield. They state their goal\nis \u201cto build living human\ntissues that are proven\nto function like native\ntissues, with reproducible\n3D tissues that accurately\nrepresent human biology\u201d.\nWhile their current\nproducts revolve mostly\naround providing in vitro\ntissue models for drug\ntesting, they are actively\ninvesting in developing\nartificial organs ready for\ntransplant. Furthermore,\nthis field appears to be\nextremely lucrative, with\na report suggesting that\n3D printing has a potential\nof being an \u201c$8.9 billion\nindustry, with $1.9 billion\n(21%) projected to be\nspent on medical applications\u201d.\nSome critics, however,\nhave their own opinions\nabout the entire matter.\nWhile there are religious\nand ethical concerns over\n\u2018man playing god\u2019 by\ncreating artificial tissues,\nthere are also concerns\nabout how this could\ncreate another divide\nbetween rich and poor.\nFurthermore, the caution\nraised by Jennifer Lewis\nagainst \u201cfalse hope\u201d\nremains: patients may\ncurrently be waiting years\nto get an organ, but these\ntechnologies may take\nanother decade to develop\nand be approved.\nHope and uncertainty\nare two sides to the\nsame coin. Though we\nwould not witness the\nresults of these efforts\ntomorrow, the day after\ntomorrow may be better\nand brighter! The world\nof medicine has promised\nmany cures in the past, but\nnot all of them become\nsuccessful, and despite\nbeing scientifically\napproved, it takes a long\njourney for any treatment\nto become an acceptable\n\u2018cure\u2019. The same goes for\norgan bio-printing: it is the\ninterplay between technological innovation, social\nacceptance, religious\nbeliefs, and legislative\nframework that will eventually shape the future of\norgan bioprinting in our\ndaily lives.\nMany patients are currently facing a wait for organs // CC\nConnect with conservation: oceanic ghostbusters\nSCIENCE\nSteve Allain\nScience Writer\nI\nam sure that many\nof you have been\nmoved by the recent\nsequences in Blue\nPlanet II highlighting\nthe devastating effects\nthat plastic is having in\nour oceans. Although\nthe production team\nremoved all the plastic\nthey came across, this\npales in comparison to\nthe amount that actually\nends up in our oceans\neach year. One of the\nmost devastating pieces\nof plastic waste that\nenters our ocean ecosystems are ghost nets.\nThese are fishing nets\nthat have unfortunately\nbeen lost, or accidentally\nleft in the ocean by\nfishermen. They drift\nthrough the ocean, or\nstay anchored in place,\nwhere they entangle\nunsuspecting marine animals such as dolphins, sea\nturtles and sharks which\ndrown when trapped.\nThis is where \u2018NetWorks\u2019 comes in: it is\nof material that would\nbenefit communities, as\nwell as the environment.\nAt the same time, ZSLwas\nin process of developing\na new model of commu-nity-based conservation.\nCoupled together, this\ncultivated in Net-Works,\nwhich seeks to empower\npeople in coastal communities in the developing\nworld by the collection\nand wholesale selling of\nlost or discarded nylon\nfishing nets. The primary\nfocus is to remove the nets\nfrom the ocean, thereafter\nhelping local communities\nraise money to increase\ntheir standard of living.\nThe nets gathered are\neventually recycled into\nyarn to make carpet tile,\nafter entering the global\nsupply chain.\nAdding to the issue is\nthe fact that we currently\nlive in a throwaway\nculture, and unfortunately\nnot everyone has the\nmeans to recycle their\nwaste. Moreover, not all\nplastic can be recycled,\nso alternative uses for the\nwaste has to be found.\nThis can only occur\nthrough innovations and\noutside-the-box thinking,\nas demonstrated through\nNet-Works. You can help\ntoo by cutting down on\nthe amount of plastic you\nuse, and doing more to\nrecycle.\nSince the start of the\nunlikely partnership, over\n142 metric tons of waste\nnets have been removed\nfrom the oceans through\nNet-Works. Currently, the\nprogram only operates\nin Cameroon and the\nPhilippines, but there are\nambitions to push things\neven further and scale\nup. This could very well\nbe the starting point of\nthe removal of billions\nof tons of plastic waste\ncurrently found in our\noceans!\nPlastic is causing numerous problems for our ocean // Wikimedia\n\u201cFishing nets\nthat have\nbeen lost can\ndrift through\nthe ocean,\nentangling\nunsuspecting\nmarine life\u201d\na unique partnership\nbetween Interface and\nthe Zoological Society\nof London (ZSL) which\nbegan in 2012.

And it\u2019s accompanied by a host of shows,\nincluding at Brixton\u2019s O2\nAcademy on February\n24th. (Word on the street\nis that Alt.

First and\nforemost, a shoutout to the\nrhythm section that kept a\ntight groove pinned down\nthroughout the 44 minute\nruntime; it sounds like\nthey were balancing on a\nknife-edge. On top, there\nare splats of synths and\nnifty little flute bits sprinkled around all over the\nplace, welcome additions\nto slower tracks that would\nhave missed the enriching.\nThis album also\nsuggests a technicality\nthat wasn\u2019t present in\nearlier Gizz works.\nThe intonation is more\ndelicate. The rhythms are\nmore precise. The compositions are more layered,\nthe band is tighter, and\nthe effort, overall, comes\noff as much more mature.\nThis album drives home,\nwithout a doubt, that King\nGizz hasn\u2019t squandered its\nmarathon recording effort\nthis year, even if bits fell\nflat. The band is better\noff for having done it.\nAnd yet, there\u2019s a\nproblem with this album,\none that shows up on some\ntracks more than others.\nIt\u2019s like flat beer - there\u2019s\nnothing wrong with the\ntaste, but it doesn\u2019t feel\nright. As technically good\nas the band feels (with\nrespect to their previous\nwork), the songs have lost\ntheir mojo, like Austin\nPowers in that one Austin\nPowers movie. There\u2019s\nno hectic sense of fun\nlike on Nonagon, nor\nis there the tongue-in-cheek jokery that made\nPaper Mache Dream\nBalloon such a pleasure.\nThis leaves us in an\nunfortunate position. The\nband is writing some of\ntheir best material, but at\nthe same time have lost the\nvital spark that made them\nso good in the first place.\nThey\u2019ve traded the irreverent energy for cold tech-nicality, and that makes it\nkind of hard to jump on\nthe hype train for this LP.\nAre they tired? Have they\nphoned it in? Is this legitimately their best effort?\nTo rehash a point that\nran in a previous edition\nof Your Favorite University Newspaper\u00a9\n, these\nguys need some time off.\nIt\u2019s summer in Australiathey should hit the beach,\nput their feet in the sand,\nand forget about recording\nfor six months.

And with it, they\nbring a whole host of friends including the likes of Kendrick, Ed Sheeran, and Rihanna.\nA\nfter the seminal\nIn Search Of...,\nN * E * R * D \u2019s\no f f e r i n g s\nthroughout the noughties\nwere but a string of\ndisappointing releases.\nAs the collective fell\noff everyone\u2019s radar, its\nmost prominent member,\nPharrell Williams, began\nhis meteoric rise to\nstardom, though Chad\nHugo and Williams would\ncontinue to produce together as The Neptunes.\nMenawhile, Williams\u2019\nwork became synonymous with hit single after\nhit single, year after year.\nWhile he wasn\u2019t working\non frivolous commercial\nalbums like Girl and\non film soundtracks\nsuch as Despicable Me,\nDespicable Me 2, and the\nnerve-wracking conclu-sion, Despicable Me 3, his\nmore discreet production\nwork absolutely took off.\nAs Williams\u2019 and The\nNeptunes\u2019 resume of production credits grew, they\npresented some of the\nmost off-kilter, original\nand creative production\nthe hip-hop scene had\never encountered. They\u2019d\ntransformed what would\notherwise be bland pop\nsongs, into something\ndynamic and full of life.\nThe duo had carved themselves a place in hip-hop\u2019s\nhistory after producing\nClipse\u2019s monstrous Hell\nHath No Fury, an absolutely electric piece of\nwork.\nCut to 2017 and\nWilliams is now a house\u201cThe\nproduction\non this album\nis alive,\nbooming and\nundeniably\nfierce\u201d\n\u201cPulsating\nwith short\nguitar stabs,\nthe track\nexplores dense\nlyrical ground\nregarding\npolice\nbrutality and\nracial unrest,\na recurring\ntheme on the\nalbum\u201d\nhold name. First single\n\u2018Lemon\u2019 is released out of\nleft-field with only sparse\ncryptic marketing. And\nnot too long after, this\nalbum is announced.\nNO ONE EVER\nREALLY DIES is striking\nfrom the get go.The album\nart is bizarre and strange,\nvulgar and yet memorable,\nwith a woman donning a\nfoil grill, shot in a style\nvaguely reminiscent of\nTerry Richardson. The\nproduction on this album\nis alive, booming and undeniably fierce, exploring\nnew ground effortlessly\nsong by song. The album\nblends the hardest, most\nexperimental shades of\nhip-hop with the ethos\nof pop music almost\nseamlessly. Energetic\nperformances from a wide\nselection of guest vocal-ists, ranging from Gucci\nMane to Ed Sheeran (who\nis surprisingly decent on\nthis) to Kendrick with the\nhighly varied production\nand beat switches, make\nfor an engaging and addictive listen. The album\nstarts off strong, with hard\nhitters like \u2018Lemon\u2019 and\n\u2018Voila\u2019 leading the way,\nthe latter featuring an\ninsanely catchy hook with\nGucci Mane. For the fifth\ntrack, we are gifted with\n\u2018Don\u2019t Do It!\u2019, featuring\nKendrick, arguably the\nbest song on this album.\nPulsating with short guitar\nstabs, the track explores\nsome dense lyrical ground\nregarding police brutality\nand racial unrest, a recurring theme on the album.\nTracks 6 to 8 are a\nshort lull. While there are\nattempts to explore new\nsounds and ideas, they\nsadly fail to pay off in this\nstretch. \u2018ESP\u2019 is generally\ndull, poorly structured\nand unable to be saved by\nproduction; the same goes\nfor \u2018Lightning Fire Magic\nPrayer\u2019, and \u2018Rollinem\n7\u2019s\u2019. The diamond in the\nmud, however, is Andr\u00e9\n3000\u2019s brief but fiery\nverse.\nThings pick up\nagain afterwards, with\n\u2018Kites\u2019, featuring M.I.A,\nKendrick, and some of the\nmost hypnotic production\non the record. The combination of M.I.A\u2019s woozy\ndelivery and Kendrick\u2019s\nrazor sharp flow is a\nlittle jarring, but certainly makes a refreshing\nchange from the stagnant\nprevious few tracks.\nHowever, \u2018Secret Life of\nTigers\u2019 is Williams at his\nmost #woke, with lyrics\nturning from an accessory\nof the production to obnoxious and silly, making\nit hard to take the song\nseriously. This is all rather\nunfortunate as the song\ncould have evidently been\nso much more. The album\nfinishes with \u2018Lifting You\u2019\nfeaturing Ed Sheeran,\nwhere he isn\u2019t absolutely\ndreadful. Things end on\na relaxed and decidedly\nlimp note, with lax production that sticks out in\nthe album, and not in a\ngood way, for it was the\nmore aggressive and edgy\nproduction that really set\nthe earlier tracks apart.\nThrough several listens,\nit has become evident that\nwe do indeed have a good\nalbum over here, but its inconsistencies stop it from\nbeing a truly great album.\nWhile most ideas are\noriginal and new, some are\nplagued by structural and\nlyrical issues, Williams\noften leaving much to be\ndesired, especially given\nthe difficult topics he tries\nto cover. Despite all this,\nthe album is mostly enjoy-able, and given some more\ntime, I reckon this album\nwill make its mark in the\nfuture as quintessential\nN*E*R*D.\nTip of the tongue, teeth and the lips // Columbia\n19\nMUSIC\nSuraj G\nMusic Writer\nArtist: N*E*R*D.

Eliot Prize for poetry\nBooks Editor Jingjie Cheng looks at this year\u2019s T.S. Eliot Prize shortlist, whose winner is announced on Monday\nBOOKS\nJingjie Cheng\nBooks Editor\nT\nhe T. S. Eliot\nPrize, awarded\nby the Poetry\nBook Society, is\narguably one of the most\nprestigious poetry prizes\nin the world. Awarded\nevery year to a poetry\ncollection in English first\npublished in the UK or\nIreland, it has seen many\nhousehold names winning\nin the past, including Ted\nHughes, Carol Ann Duffy,\nSeamus Heaney, and\nDerek Walcott.\nThe Poetry Book\nsociety started the prize\nin 1993, on their 40th an-niversary, in honour of its\nfounding poet T.S. Eliot.\nSince then, along with the\nForward Prize in poetry, it\nhas become one of the two\nmost important literary\nprizes in the UK dedicated\nsolely to poetry. This year,\nto mark the 25th anniversary of the prize, the prize\nmoney has been increased\nto \u00a325,000.\nThe shortlist is announced every October,\nand 2017\u2019s was selected\nout of 154 entries, by\njudges Bill Herbert, James\nLasdun, and Helen Mort.\nAs per tradition, shortlisted poets will participate\nin a reading at the Royal\nFestival Hall this Sunday.\nAs poet Sandeep\nParmar noted in his article\nin The Guardian, while\nthis year\u2019s shortlist is\ndefinitely deserving, there\nis a glaring lack of BAME\npoets, especially since\n2017 has seen a significant amount of work from\nBAME poets published,\nincluding Kayo Chingonyi, Richard Georges,\nAndr\u00e9 Naffis-Sahely, and\nNick Makoha, among\nothers.\nThe only minority poet\non the shortlist, however,\nhas always been one of my\nfavourite poets, and I\u2019m\nglad that he has made the\nlist: Ocean Vuong is a Vietnamese-American poet\nwhose poetry has always\nsounded like music to me.\nHis work often combines\nthe balladic nature of his\ngrandmother\u2019s stories\nand folk songs with his\nkeen grasp of the English\nlanguage. Born on a rice\nfarm outside Saigon, he\narrived in the US at the\nage of two after his family\nspent a year in a refugee\ncamp in the Philippines.\nHis collection Night Sky\nwith Exit Wounds explores\nthemes of home, loss,\nand family, opening with\n\u2018Telemachus\u2019, a poem\nabout the relationship\nbetween the narrator and\nhis father, which is at once\nboth intimate and distant,\npersonal and anony-mous. The title itself,\n\u2018Telemachus\u2019, suggests\nthe fraught homecoming\nof Odysseus to his son.\nIndeed, classical references dot the collection, often\nin order to deepen themes\nand reveal the paradoxes\nbehind complex emotions.\nThe collection that\nstruck me most was\nJacqueline Saphra\u2019s All\nMy Mad Mothers, which\nexplores love, sex, and\nfamily through themes\nrelated to motherhood.\nHer poems are bold and\nenergetic, words that\nbound along, extravagantly painting a picture\nof what a mother is, in\nall her multitudes. The\ntitle poem, \u2018All My Mad\nMothers\u2019, describes the\nnarrator\u2019s mother \u2018trying\nto catch the sun\u2019, \u2018sucking\nfruit flies through a straw\u2019,\n\u2018barely spoke between her\nbruises\u2019, and finally, \u2018hard\nto grasp\u2019, trying \u2018to ease\nher way into this world. Or\nout of it.\u2019 The mother is at\nonce imaginary and very\nreal. This is not a standard\ncollection of poetry appreciating motherhood or\nelevating mother-daughter\nrelationships.

That\u2019s right: a\nbank-breaking one thousand pounds per woman.\nSuch a tax would significantly limit access to the\npill \u2013 I personally would\nnot be able to afford it if\nI were charged that much.\nIf we allow any form of\ncontraception to be taxed,\nregardless of the size of\nthe tax, then we make it\nacceptable to limit access\nto it. But we can solve\nour environmental issues\nwithout hindering the\nability of people to control\ntheir own bodies.\nThe contraceptive pill\ncontains the hormone\nethinyl estradiol (EE2),\nwhich is not removed by\nthe sewage system, and\nremains in wastewater.\nIt can lead to intersex\nchanges in fish, causing\npopulations to decline or\neven collapse as males are\neliminated. Mr Worstall\nbases his tax conclusions\non a 2012 paper by Owen\nand Jobling in Nature. It\nstates that the total cost\nfor the UK to update the\nsewage system is more\nthan \u00a330bn, and the\nyearly running cost per\nplant would be \u00a3800,000.\nSince then, the EU has\nplaced EE2, and other\npharmaceuticals, under\nregulation. To meet the\ncost, options discussed\nwere an increase in\nhousehold bills or a tax on\npharmaceutical compa-nies. Big Pharma, whose\nprofit margins outstrip\nthose of banks, the media,\nand oil and gas, claimed\nthey cannot pay the tax\ndue to the cost of R&D.\nonly EE2), and, as far as\nI can tell from research, it\nis the tax-payer, not Big\nPharma, paying.\nMr Worstall bases his\nargument on the principle\nof \u201cpolluter should pay\u201d:\nif you use the pollutant\nthen you \u2018should\u2019 be\ntaxed for it. But he does\nnot explore this argument\nfully. EE2 is not the\nonly chemical wreaking\nenvironmental havoc that\nsewage systems do not\nremove: antibiotics are not\nremoved by the sewage\nsystem, and studies show\nthat this is contributing\nto antibiotic resistance\nas the antibiotics interact\nwith bacteria associated\nwith sewage treatment\nplants. Following his line\nof argument, we should\nalso tax anyone who uses\nantibiotics.\nOther chemicals not\ncompletely removed\ninclude pesticides, her-bicides, and household\nchemicals. Pesticides and\nherbicides impact the\ngrowth and reproduction\nof wildlife, and cause\nlowered disease resistance\nand death. Household\nchemicals \u2013 shampoo,\ndetergent, toothpaste\n\u2013 have similar effects.\nPhosphates in detergent\nencourage the growth of\ntoxic algae which reduces\nwater oxygen levels,\nreducing aquatic diversity.\nShould we tax homeowners for using laundry\ndetergent? We need to be\nfair if we tax anyone for\nthe associated pollution\nof the chemicals they use.\nOtherwise, Mr Worstall\nseems to be suggesting\nthat we single out women\non the pill.\nThe environmental\ndamage caused by EE2\nand other chemicals\nchoice of using a 99%\neffective, free from point\nof service, and mostly\nside-effect free method of\ncontraception.\nMr Worstall states\nthat women have other\noptions: \u201c\u2026there are a\nnumber of alternative\nmethods, various barriers,\ncreams, sponges, IUDs,\nwhich do not carry this\nenvironmental cost\u2026.\u201d\nI am not convinced he\nknows much about female\ncontraception. Choice\nof contraception is not a\nflippant decision, given\nthat each option works\ndifferently, and women\u2019s\nbodies respond different-ly. There is no \u2018one size\nfits all\u2019method, so it needs\nto be easy for people to\nchoose the option that\nsuits them.\nSponges fail 9%-24%\nof the time, depending on\nwhether the woman has\nThe pill is a safe and accessible option for millions of women // CC\n\u201cThe pill is\nnot the only\nchemical\nwrecking\nenvironmental\nhavoc \u2013\nantibiotics do\ntoo\u201d\nneeds to be addressed.\nBut we need to solve our\nenvironmental problems\nwithout hindering the\nreproductive rights of the\n2.5 million women who\nuse the pill every day in\nthe UK, or the 100 million\nThe EU and UK governments plan to upgrade the\nsewage system to remove\na range of chemicals (not\n\u201cWe must solve\nour problems\nwithout\nhindering the\nrights of the\n2.5 million UK\nwomen who\nuse the pill\ndaily\u201d\nworldwide.

For\nthose of you expecting\nanything radically different from the paper this\nyear, prepare to be disap-pointed: it will continue\nto pump out the same trite\nleftist bullshit as last year\nas it has nearly every year\nsince the degenerates took\nover the paper. In their\ndefence however, it does\nappear that those of a more\nconservative persuasion\nCOMMENT\nGrumpy Bastard\nComment Writer\nstruggle to string anything\nlonger than a sentence\ntogether and certainly\nnot an eloquent article. I\nwill spell it out for you:\nif you want your views\nrepresented in the paper\nthen you have to write for\nit. Bitching on Imperial\nSecrets won\u2019t change that,\nyou fucking lemon.\nMoving on to the\nmain topic of this week\u2019s\nventing of spleen: New\nYear, and why it can fuck\noff. New Year, or, as I\nprefer to know it, \u2018the\ncollective hangover from\nthe Christmas, and the last\nexcuse for freedom before\nthe grinding drudgery of\neveryday life begins\u2019, is\nwidely celebrated all over\nthe world for some reason.\nExactly what that reason\nmostly the same. I just\nhope people are equally\noverjoyed when a giant\nspace death ball obeys the\nvery same laws and wipes\nout civilisation.\nLike a prisoner\ndragging a ball and chain\nbehind him, the New Year\nbrings with it a flood of\nretrospective contemplation about your personal\nachievements and failures\nof the year behind you as\nwell as a strange sense of\noptimism about the world\nbeing a better place simply\nbecause the number at the\nend of the date has incremented by one. I despise\noptimism in general, but\nespecially the form that it\ntakes at New Year\u2019s: the\nresolutions. Resolutions,\nnext to the American\nway of writing the date,\nare possibly the stupidest\nthing that human beings\nhave come up with. On\na serious note, what kind\nof perverse mind decided\nthat the date should be\nwritten that way? If any\nother nation also copies\nthis system, then you\ntoo are a bunch of stupid\npricks.\nI am unsure exactly\nwhat it is about resolutions that makes me so\nangry. It could be the\ninsincerity of it, or the fact\nthat everyone approaches\nthem with the genuine\nbelief that the future will\nbe better than the past,\nrather than acknowledge\nthat it will be identical\nexcept with hangovers\nas a growing up present.\nFor those of you yet to\nexperience a hangover,\nit\u2019s like being hit on the\nhead by the Hunchback of\nNotre Dame, while your\nbody attempts to turn you\ninside out in the mistaken\nbelief that this will help in\nany way. Imagine being\ncompletely immobilised\nand also staring at your\nown vomit on a plug\nsocket for an entire day\nand throwing up every\ntime you put something in\nyour mouth. That is your\nfuture: a sad pile of puke\nnext to your face. Happy\nNew Year.\nalready given birth. Spermicide creams have to be\nused alongside another\nform of contraception,\nas alone they fail 30%\nof the time. A diaphragm\n(barrier), used with\nspermicide, has an effectiveness of 92-96% but\ncarries a risk of bladder\ninfection and toxic shock\nsyndrome. A change of\nweight of only 3kg means\na new diaphragm has to\nbe fitted, and while some\nwomen may find it simple\nto place in and remove\na sponge or diaphragm\nbefore and after sex,\nothers would not. A tax\non the pill would leave\noptions which are less\neffective and more hassle\n\u2013 options which don\u2019t suit\na busy lifestyle. Sorry Mr\nWorstall, I am quite busy\nworking towards a career.\nThe IUD and implant\nare 99% effective and\npreferred if women are\nlikely to forget the pill.\nHowever, given that they\nare invasive, there\u2019s a\nsmall risk of infection and\nthe IUD can cause pain\nor bleeding. Furthermore,\nthe implant can\u2019t be used\nwith certain medications\nor antibiotics. Condoms\nare 98% effective, and\nunlike other methods\nprotect against STIs; but\nthey are much less easy to\naccessforfreeontheNHS,\nand in stores they can be\nexpensive. While some\nwomen may experience\nside-effects from the pill,\ntives can have an impact\non the environment: latex\ncondoms, for example,\ncontain additives to\nprevent breakage, but\nthis means they take a\nlong time to break down.\nSome condoms are\nnon-biodegradable, while\nthe one biodegradable\ncondom is made of natural\nlambskin, but does not\nprotect from some STIs.\nWho should we tax for\nthe environmental impact\nof condoms? Again, Mr\nWorstall has forgotten\nabout his own \u2018polluter\nshould pay\u2019 argument.\nFrom another angle, it\nwould also be unfair to\nonly allow richer women\nto use the pill. We cannot\nignore the fact that unintended pregnancy disproportionately impacts\nwomen in poorer com-munities. Limiting their\naccess to contraception\nonly makes it harder for\nthem to control their lives\nand invest in their futures.\nAnd, what does Mr\nWorstall think of the\neconomic and social costs\nof unintended pregnan-cy? The environmental\nimpact of unintended\nextra humans? He doesn\u2019t\nconsider any of this in his\narticle. These are issues\nthat should be considered\nbefore placing a tax on\ncontraception.\nRegardless of whether\none or several contraceptive methods are\ntaxed, taxing any form\nof contraception turns it\ninto a political, social, and\neconomic issue. Limiting\naccess jeopardizes the\nhealth of women by\nreducing access to basic,\npreventative healthcare.\nContraception reduces\nunintended pregnancy\nand abortion; it helps\nwomen control their own\nlives and invest in their\nfutures; it helps couples\nplan families. It\u2019s not hard\nto guess that a tax on one\nof the main forms of contraception may influence\nnumbers of unintended\npregnancies.\nContraception saves\ngovernments across the\nworld billions in healthcare costs. Women who\ncannot afford contracep-tion, or to look after a\nbaby, still have sex. An\nNHS report showed that\nbetween 2013 and 2020,\nunintended pregnancy and\nSTIs will cost between\n\u00a384.4-127 billion.\nContinued cuts could\nincrease this by \u00a38.3-10\nbillion. Improved access,\ncompared to current\naccess, would save \u00a33.7-5\n\u201cWhile\nsome may\nexperience\nside-effects,\nthe pill is more\naccessible\nthan many\nother forms of\ncontraception\u201d\nit is less invasive, simpler\nto use, more effective,\nand more accessible than\nother forms.\nBut even these alterna-contraceptive pill to pay\nfor the sewage system\nupgrade is not an option.\nIt makes sense to upgrade\nit so that it removes all\nharmful substances, to\nprevent other environmental issues, as well\nas feminisation of fish.\nMethods that remove\nEE2, antibiotics, and\nother substances have\nbeen tested. There needs\nto be a general tax for\nall upgrades, and either\ntax payers or relevant\ncompanies need to pay.\nThe authors of the main\nstudy were concerned\nthe decision would be\nmade behind closed doors\nand that the government\nwould not engage the\npublic. I don\u2019t know about\nyou, but this article was\nthe first I had heard of it.\nI strongly believe\nthat my generation and\nthe generations to come\nhave the capacity, moral\nsense, and intelligence to\nsolve our environmental\nproblems, but without\nhaving to sacrifice what\nwe believe in.\n\u201cReducing\naccess to the\npill would\nincrease\nhealthcare\ncosts overall \u2013\nit\u2019s illogical\u201d\nbillion. Unintended pregnancy is currently predicted to cost \u00a35.2 billion over\nthis period, and reducing\naccess would increase\nthis by \u00a3299 million. Its\nillogical to reduce access.\nTaxing the users of the\n\u201cI despise\noptimism in\ngeneral, but\nespecially the\nform that it\ntakes at New\nYear\u201d\nis, I have yet to establish,\nbut as far as I can tell, it\nseems to be that people\nare thrilled that orbital\nmechanics are staying\n\n"

Former\nprisons minister Sam\nGyimah takes over\nfrom Jo Johnson, who\nhas been moved to the\nDepartment for Transport (DfT). Johnson has\nfaced pressure in recent\nweeks over the appointment of Toby Young to\nthe board of the Office\nfor Students (OfS), the\nbody responsible for\nholding universities to\naccount. Among those\nraising concerns, Imperial\u2019s assistant provost\n(equality, diversity and\ninclusion) Professor Stephen Curry, vice-provost\n(education) Professor\nSimone Buitendijk, and\nCollege Union President\nAlex Compton cosigned an open letter to\nJohnson, questioning\nYoung\u2019s suitability for\nthe role.\nYoung, a journalist and\nadvocate for free schools,\nwas criticised heavily for\nhis lack of experience and\nrelevant qualifications.\nFurther anger arose over\ncomments Young had\nmade on Twitter and in\nhis columns, which were\nderogatory to women,\ndisabled people, and\nworking class students.\nCritics have claimed\nthat these statements are\ninconsistent with the\nOfS\u2019 duty to \u201cpromote\nequality of opportunity\nin connection with access\nto and participation in\nhigher education\u201d. Young\nsubsequently deleted\nthousands of tweets from\nhis account, describing\nhis previous comments as\n\u201csophomoric and silly\u201d.\nProfessor Curry\u2019s letter,\nhowever, notes that Young\nwas already a \u201cmature\nadult\u201d when the tweets\nwere posted. The letter\nfurther states: \u201c[Young\u2019s]\nattempt to characterise\nthese [comments] as\nstudent behaviour shows\nthat he is out of touch\nwith the standards of\nconduct we would expect\nof our students at Imperial\nCollege.\u201d\nThe letter also criticised Young\u2019s articles on\neducational theory and\n\u2018progressive eugenics\u2019,\ncalling them unscholarly\nand flawed.\nJohnson claimed that\nYoung\u2019s appointment\nwould help to provide \u201cthe\nscrutiny and challenge to\nthe [education] sector that\nstudents and taxpayers\ndeserve\u201d as Young is not\na university insider. This\nseemed to indicate that the\nDepartment for Education\n(DfE) was backtracking\nfrom its previous exaggerated claims that Young\nhad held teaching posts at\nHarvard and Cambridge\nuniversity. Young also distanced himself from these\nstatements, acknowledging that while he had\ntaught undergraduates at\nboth universities, he had\nnever held an academic\npost.\nJohnson\u2019s defence of\nYoung has been linked to\nhis subsequent transfer\nto the DfT.

Scheduled to\nbe released in the States at\nthe end of last year, with\nKevin Spacey in the lead,\nthe film seemed doomed\nfollowing the numerous\nsexual assault accusations\nagainst Spacey that had\nemerged. Instead of canning the project, however,\nScott decided to reshoot\nSpacey\u2019s scenes, having\nChristopher Plummer play\nthe tight-fisted billionaire\nJ.P. Getty instead. It was\nan audacious move, one\nthat only the most dedicated director could pull\noff; Scott proves himself\nto be meticulously organ-ised, or slightly insane, or\nperhaps both. The release\ndate was only delayed by\nthree days.\nA momentous under-taking, perhaps, but it also\nmakes it a difficult film\nto review \u2013 any positive\naspects are bound to be\ntaken out of proportion,\nwhile faults can be\nexcused as a result of\nthe extensive reshoots.\nUltimately, however, the\ncircumstances of the production will go down as\nthe most interesting aspect\nof the film: All the Money\nis a technically-competent\nbut stolid drama, which\nleaves little impression\nonce the credits have\nrolled.\nTaking as its source\nmaterial Painfully Rich:\nThe Outrageous Fortunes\nand Misfortunes of the\nHeirs of J. Paul Getty by\nJohn Pearson, who is no\nstranger to salubrious bi-ographies, All the Money\ncentres on the kidnapping\nof J.P Getty\u2019s grandson,\nPaul (Charlie Plummer),\nby Italian Mafiosi. After\nthe initial kidnapping, we\nare treated to about thirty\nminutes of explanatory\nfootage, which establishes how Getty became\nrich (oil), his parenting\nstyle (distant), and his\nspending habits (frugal).\nThis section, which darts\nacross countries and time\nzones with such speed it\u2019s\ndizzying, seems largely\nunnecessary, particularly\nwhen the film\u2019s runtime\nmeans it begins to drag\nduring the second half.\nOnce we get back\ninto the meat of the film,\nwe manage to fall into\na steady rhythm. The\nbeating heart of the plot is\nPaul\u2019s mother, Gail Harris\n(Michelle Williams), who\nmarried into the Getty\nfamily before divorcing\nher husband after he\nbecomes addicted to\ndrugs. She\u2019s fighting\na battle on three sides:\ntrying to convince her\nson\u2019s kidnappers that she\ndoesn\u2019t have the money\nthey\u2019re after, whilst simultaneously dealing with\nthe Italian police and her\nex-father-in-law. She\u2019s\nfacing an uphill struggle\nto have Getty pay the\nransom fund: he refuses\nto hand over the money,\ninitially because he is\nconvinced by his advisor\nFletcher Chase (Mark\nWahlberg) that the kidnapping has been staged.\nEven when it all turns out\nto be gruesomely true, he\nbalks at giving away any\nmore than the maximum\ntax-deductible amount.\nAny concerns that\nPlummer\u2019s rapid addition\nmay come across in his\nacting are unfounded:\nhe inhabits the juicy role\nof Getty with aplomb,\nsavouring his lines like\nluxurious morsels, and\nmanaging to captivate in\nall his scenes. He portrays\nGetty as a ruthless\ntyrant, resplendent in his\nmoral iniquity, allowing\nus to largely (but not\ncompletely) banish\nSpacey\u2019s spectre from the\nscreen. He is matched by\nWilliams, who \u2013 despite\nbeing burdened with an\nunfortunate wig \u2013 delivers\nher lines with a Katharine\nHepburn-esque gravitas.\nShe shows the horrific\nsituation Gail is put in\npitch-perfectly, moving\nfrom outrage to sorrow\nover the span of a couple\nof lines. Wahlberg, on the\nother hand, seems slightly\nmiscast: his Chase lacks\nthe high drama of his coleads\u2019characters, and he is\nnever able to lose himself\nwithin his role entirely.\nWith his usual eye\nfor visual style, Scott is\nbrilliant at portraying the\nfranticism of Rome during\nthe 1960s and \u201870s, all\npaparazzi on vespas, wide\nlapels, and classic cars.\nScott moves his camera\nthrough interior locations\nwith grace, ensuring that\nthe audience takes in every\naspect of the space, often\nframed with shafts of soft\nlight filtering in. All the\nMoney in the World is an\nincredibly textural film,\na facet reflected in Janty\nYates\u2019 beautiful costume\ndesign, which Scott highlights throughout.\nWhere All the Money\nin the World really falls\ndown, however, is when\nit is deciding what sort of\nfilm it wants to be. While\nthe first thirty minutes\nresemble a family drama,\nfor the remainder Scott\nseems to veer between\nthriller, romance, and\nprocedural drama. It\u2019s not\nhelped by the creative liberties Scott took with the\nsource material, tacking\non extra sequences which\ncome across as redundant,\nadding little other than\nbolstering an already-long\nruntime. Scott switches\nlanes frequently, never\nleaving us with enough\ntime to enjoy the action\nplaying out in front of\nus. The film leaves us\nwith more questions than\nanswers, mainly about\nwhy such a film needed to\nbe made, or what sort of\npoint it\u2019s making. While\nthere are the beginnings\nof several great films\nin All the Money, the\nleads simply trail out.\nScott should have learnt\nsome lessons from Getty\nhimself: if you try and\nhave everything, you\u2019ll\njust end up with nothing\nat all.\nRidley Scott\u2019s All the Money in the World tries to take on too much, and the result is a film that lacks focus.\nMichelle Williams managing to act despite another bad wig #Justice4Michelle // Sony\nFILM\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nDir: Ridley Scott.

On the surface\na gentle buddy comedy,\nLinklater draws links\nbetween the America\nof the 70s with its more\nmodern iteration, suggesting that some things never\nreally change.\nReleased 26th\nJanuary\nLoveless\nRussian director\nAndrey Zvyagintsev\nbroke through into the\nmainstream last year\nwith Leviathan \u2013 a tragic\nretelling of the biblical\nstory of Job, this portentous tragedy, of epic\nproportions, set out to\nexpose the corruption that\nlies at the heart of modern\nRussia. He follows this\nup with Loveless, which\nagain serves as a critique\nof Russian life. Taking\nas its starting point a\nchild who goes missing,\nLoveless explores topics\nas wide-ranging as class\ndivisions, married life,\nand the callousness of\nan overstretched police\nforce. With a painterly\neye, Zvyagintsev takes us\nthrough a series of beau-tifully-composed scenes,\nwhich nevertheless retain\na sense of existential\ndread.\nReleased 9th\nFebruary\nThe Shape of Water\nSally Hawkins is\none of the most unique\nBritish actors working\ntoday.

She falls in\nlove with an amphibian\ncreature the government\nhas captured, in a story of\nforbidden passion, with\nMichael Shannon taking\non the antagonist role\nas Colonel Strickland,\nwho is in charge of the\nfacility. Michael Stuhlbarg continues his sterling\nsupport work as one of\nthe lab\u2019s scientists, while\nOctavia Spencer stars as\none of Elisa\u2019s colleagues.\nDel Toro is back where\nhe\u2019s most comfortable: a\nrichly-textured world of\nfantasy and drama, where\nreal life and the magical\ncoincide with ease and\ngrace.

Through the course of seven episodes, David Attenborough\u2019s intrepid team took us\nthrough the splendour of the oceans, and what we\u2019re doing to them.\n\u201cBlue Planet II\nis a testament\nto the tenacity\nand ingenuity\nof the BBC\nteams\u201d\nT\nhe BBC\u2019s nature\nd o c u m e n t a r y\nseries Blue\nPlanet II comes\n16 years after the original ground-breaking\nprogramme came to\nour television screens.\nNarrated by none\nother than Sir David\nAttenborough, scored\nby the Academy Award\nwinning composer Hans\nZimmer, and using the\nlatest in camera technolo-gy, such as suction-cupped\ncameras mounted to the\nbacks of killer-whales,\nBlue Planet II chronicles\nthe untold stories of our\nocean\u2019s creatures like\nnever before.\nTo reveal the lives of\nthese sub-aquatic animals\nover seven episodes, the\nBlue Planet II teams spent\nfive years researching\nand filming for the series.\nThis amounted to 125 expeditions in 39 countries\nand over 6,000 hours of\nfootage: a testament to the\nBBC teams\u2019 tenacity and\ningenuity.\nAttenborough\u2019s narration is colourful and\nheart-warming, with the\ncamera-work nothing\nshort of a visual marvel.\nHans Zimmer\u2019s mastery\nof music is the perfect\naccompaniment to the\nvisuals, as though each\nnote was composed,\nbespoke, for each frame.\nThis all culminates into\na treat for the eyes, ears,\nand soul.\nThe nature documentary series has received a\nreception akin to that of a\nHollywood blockbuster:\nthe first episode was the\nmost streamed program on\nBBC iPlayer in 2017, with\nover 4.2 million views to\ndate. Discoveries previously unknown to science,\nevents never before\ncaptured on camera, and\na vivid message about our\nown impact on the oceans\nthat may well change the\nway people and governments think about the\nseas: these are a few of\nthe achievements of Blue\nPlanet II thus far.\nEpisode one: One\nOcean \u2013 Clever fish\nIn the first episode,\nwe meet a remarkable\nlittle fish that challenges\nour understanding of fish\nintelligence. The tusk\nfish is named after the six\nchaotic teeth it uses to grip\nonto hard-shelled clams.\nIt takes a single clam to\na special coral, where it\nthen proceeds to whack\nit against a protruding,\nanvil-like rock. After\nmore than fifty hits, the\ndetermined fish eventually breaks through to the\nmeat, claiming its reward.\nThat fish can have the\nability to use tools was a\nremarkable discovery for\nthe filming team. In the\nfinal episode, we learn\nthat this particular fish\nwas given the name Percy,\nthe persistent. We meet\nAlex, the cameraman who\nhad been diving in these\nwaters since he was five\nand had filmed Percy. He\ndescribes the utter devastation caused by the coral\nbleaching events that took\nplace during the time of\nfilming: Percy\u2019s coral\nkitchen, once vibrant and\ncolourful, turns a skeletal\nwhite, creating a lump at\nthe back of our throats.\nEpisode two: The\nDeep \u2013 Sinking into\nthe darkness of an alien world\nThe second episode\ntakes us to a place we\nknow less about than the\nsurface of the moon: our\ndeep oceans. We voyage\nto deep sea brine lakes,\nwhere an eel spasms out\nof control as it is poisoned\nby the harsh conditions,\nand to the Mariana\nTrench, deep enough to\nswallow Mount Everest\nand where life on Earth\nmay have begun.\nThe sequence following a 30-tonne whale\ncarcass sinking from the\nsurface to the sea floor\nwas the most memorable.\nThe whale creates a\nculinary bonanza for the\ncreatures of the deep. The\naudience\u2019s jaws drop as\nsix-gill sharks come from\nfar and wide, eventually\ncovering the body of the\nwhale, ravenously tearing\noff chunks of flesh to\nsatiate their appetites\nthat have developed after\nnearly a year of fasting.\nCrabs and other scavengers clear the carcass\nleaving nothing but bone\nafter 3 months. This bone\nis eventually consumed\nas well, finishing off the\ncircular recycling process.\nEpisode three: Coral\nReefs \u2013 Chaos in coral\ncathedrals\nCoral occupies less than\none-tenth of one percent\nof the ocean floor, yet is\nhome to a quarter of all\nmarine species. We saw\nscenes of octopus teaming\nup with grouper, using\nsignals to communicate\nwith each other to catch a\nmeal, as well as cuttlefish\nmesmerising their prey\nwith their iridescent glow\nbefore dispatching it.\nThe most unforgettable\nmoment comes when, on\none of the most remote\nand pristine reefs in the\nworld, huge grouper come\ntogether in their thousands\nto spawn. The thrilling\nsequence shows the\nanimals racing towards\neach other to fertilise\neggs that would produce\nthe next generation. In\nthe mating commotion,\nhowever, sharks took advantage of the distracted\nfish, and picked off lovers\none-by-one.\nEpisode four: Big\nBang \u2013 Nowhere to\nhide\nDetailing the de-sert-like vastness of the\nopen ocean, this episode\u2019s\nmost remarkable story\nwas one once confined to\nthe legend of \u2018the boiling\nsea\u2019.\nInaremotecornerofthe\nPacific Ocean, we witness\na feast of gargantuan\nproportions. Amongst the\nhundreds of diners were\nspinner dolphins, aptly\nnamed for their spontaneous aerial pirouettes\nthey do mid-swim; tuna\nwho trail-blazed a way to\nthe action at 40 miles an\nhour; mobula rays with\ntwo-meter wingspans\nand gaping wide mouths;\nand sail-fish, amongst\nthe fastest fish in the sea.\nThey swarmed around\na massive shoal of tiny\nlantern fish who had\nnowhere to hide.\nDebunking the myth,\nthe aerial camera shot\nshows the sea frothing\nlike boiling water in the\nmiddle of the otherwise\nfeatureless ocean from\nthe commotion caused by\nthe feeding frenzy. The\nonslaught lasted less than\n15 minutes but decimated\nthe shoal of fish, leaving\nbehind nothing but silvery\nscales, falling like snow\ninto the ocean\u2019s depths.\nA fisherman\u2019s tale,\nit\u2019s easy to imagine how\nsea-men of the past, who\nwitnessed this event, may\nhave mistaken the sea\nto be boiling as bubbles\nBlue Planet II will be an inspiration for many artists // Callum Richie (IG: @_crill)\nTELEVISION\nRatan Gor\nTV Writer\nBLUE PLANET II\nthe beauty and fragility of our oceans\n\u201cStunning\ndrone footage\ncaptures\nsequences\nin crystal-clear waters,\nleaving us\nmesmerised\u201d\nrose around their boats\nsuddenly in an otherwise\nfeatureless blueness.\nEpisode five: Green\nSeas \u2013 Most life lives\nwhere it\u2019s green, not\nblue\nA common octopus\noff the coast of South\nAfrica stole the show in\nthis episode, dazzling\nscientists in the process.\nLiving in kelp forests,\nwith over 100 species of\nshark who have octopus\non their menu, it must\nmake a living hiding in\nnooks and crannies and\nambushing unsuspecting\ncrabs. A pyjama shark\nhowever, named for its\nskin, which looks like\nstriped PJs, squeezes\ninto the octopus\u2019 hiding\ncrevice and in a flurry of\nmovement catches it in\nits jaws. It all seems over\nbut the clever mollusc\nsticks its tentacles into the\nshark\u2019s gills, choking it,\nand so forcing it to let go.\nIts name perhaps\ndoesn\u2019t do this remarkably clever animal justice.\nThe octopus, now in the\nopen, attaches shells and\ndebris to the suckers of its\ntentacles, protecting itself\nin armour and hiding in\nplain sight, thus confusing\nthe shark, allowing it to\nballs were once hunted to\nthe brink of extinction for\ntheir coats, but have now\nmade a recovery thanks to\nremarkable conservation\nefforts. We are treated to\ncuteness that would rival\nany YouTube cat video\nas a mother preens and\nconditions its tiny pup\u2019s\ncoat to fluff it up, making\nit buoyant, allowing it\nto float in the sea! The\nsea otter\u2019s recovery had\nsecondary effects, maintaining the health of kelp\nforests which play an\nimportant part in trapping\ncarbon dioxide, countering climate change.\nEpisode six: Coasts\n\u2013 Animals run the\ngauntlet from land to\nsea\nWe follow a group of\nbachelor Galapagos sea\nlions hunting tuna. The\n60-kilogram fish would\nbe much too fast for the\nmarine mammals in an\nopen-sea race and so, to\ncatch their prey, the sea\nlions employ their wit and\ncunning: they drive a few\ntuna into a shallow, rocky\ncove by the coast where\nthere is a greater chance\nfor them to land a catch.\nInitially, one male\nattempts this alone to no\navail, as the slick tuna\ngive him the slip. He\nthen comes back with\nreinforcements. Multiple\nsea lions, with a strategy\nto rival an NFL side, all\ntake up their roles for\nthe hunt. Some drive the\ntuna into the coves whilst\nothers wait at the entrance\nto prevent their escape.\nThe stunning drone\nfootage captures the\nsequence in the crys-tal-clear waters and leaves\nthe audience mesmerised,\nwaiting with bated breath\nto see whether the band of\nbrothers are triumphant.\nThey are, and at the end\nyou see the efforts and\ntime that went into producing the seven minute\nscene.\nEpisode seven: Our\nBlue Planet \u2013 The\nproblems that we create and only we can\nsolve\nThe final episode\nsheds light on the extent\nto which humans are\ndegrading the seas and\nthreatening the existence\nof the creatures who\ndwell within them, which\nhave delighted us over\nthe previous episodes.\nThroughout the series,\nthere were hints at the\nextent to which humanity\nwas degrading our blue\nplanet, but in the finale\nthis inconvenient reality\nis laid bare. The viewer\nis forced to pause for\nintrospection because, in\nreality, there is no planet\nII. Although casting a\nsombre tone, its overall\nmessage is one of hope,\nas we meet the incredible\npeople dedicating their\nlives to safeguarding the\nseas and its wonders.\nWe meet Len, from\nTrinidad and Tobago, who\nwas met with resistance,\naggression, and threats\nto his safety when he\nfirst started protecting his\nisland\u2019s leatherback sea\nturtles after realising there\nwas an imminent risk of\nextinction if nothing was\ndone to protect them.\nThese giants, weighing\nnearly half a tonne, came\nto the shores to lay their\nping-pong-ball-sized\neggs, during which time\nthey were defenceless and\nwere commonly killed for\ntheir meat.\nPoachers who once\nhunted them, however,\nnow play an integral part\nin their conservation.\nChildren are taught about\ntheir natural heritage\nin school, and the local\neconomy is also bene-fiting, as tourist flock to\ncatch a glimpse of these\nocean behemoths. Len\nand his team\u2019s tireless\nefforts now mean that the\nbeaches of Trinidad and\nTobago are home to the\nbest populations of leath-erbacks in the world!\nPerhaps the most pertinent message put to us all\nrelates to our infatuation\nwith plastics, especially\nthose of the \u2018disposable\u2019\nand the \u2018convenient\u2019 type.\nEight million tonnes of\nthe stuff find its way into\nour oceans each year,\nwreaking havoc on marine\nlife in even the remotest\nfour after its milk had\nbeen laced with environmental plastic molecules\nwas a troubling reminder\nof our need to reassess our\nrelationship with plastic.\nThe episode and series\nas a whole gave us a\nnumber of bitter pills to\nswallow. David Attenborough, however, is perhaps\nthe only person able to\nmake a nation, and maybe\nplanet, take it.\n\u00a7\nOf all the stars in the\nshow, the most remarkable\nwas one of our own: Sir\nDavid Attenborough. He\nheld our attention and awe\nthroughout each episode,\nand in the finale, like a\nbenevolent grandparent,\nhe held our hand whilst\ngently delivering the\nmessage that we had to be\nmore careful and take care\nof the world we live in.\nIt had to be him though.\nWere it anyone else, we\nwould have no doubt\nsnatched away our hand\nlike an infant throwing\na tantrum. His oratory\ngenius, authentic delivery,\nand ability to remove any\nscientific distance from\nthe audience, left us with\na sense of optimism and\nencouragement, rather\nthan one of sorrow and\ndespair.\nSir David provided\na rejuvenation for the\nhuman spirit. At the age\nof 91, he still displays the\nfascination and curiosity\nof a child, still marvelling\nat the creatures he has\nspent his life document-ing. However, he also\nprovides us all with sage\nwisdom. In his final\nmonologue, he states:\n\u201cNever before have we\nhad such an awareness of\nwhat we are doing to the\nplanet and never before\nhave we had the power\nto do something about\nthat. Surely, we have a responsibility to care for our\nblue planet. The future of\nhumanity and indeed all\nlife on Earth now depends\non us\u201d.\nRather than being com-plicit in its destruction,\nmaybe we can now be part\nof the ocean\u2019s salvation?\nBlue Planet II reminded us of what we stand to lose if we continue polluting // BBC\neventually escape and live\nanother day.\nA notable contender for\nthe most memorable scene\nwas that of sea otters.\nThese sea-dwelling fur\n\u201cAttenborough\nprovided a\nrejuvination\nfor the human\nspirit\u201d\ncorners of the globe.\nBroken down plastic\nand industrial effluent\nproduce a toxic soup\nwhich enters the food-chain, killing creatures\nlike the dolphins, whales,\nand seabirds we came to\nadore. The macabre scene\nof a pilot whale carrying\nher dead calf in episode\n\n"

It is the story of\nthe fictive Roman general\nTitus Andronicus, who\nreturns to Rome after\nhaving entrapped Tamora,\nQueen of the Goths, and\nher three sons. The eldest\nson will soon be killed,\nand a series of revenges\nare set in motion. The play\nfollows the struggle and\nstrife for ultimate revenge\nbetween the emperor of\nRome, the Goths, and the\nAndronicus family; a violent journey characterized\nby sorrow and a couple of\nbeheadings.\nThe play starts subtly.\nActors are crossing the\nstage. Their appearance,\nwith their relaxed posture\nand casual clothing, make\nthem easy to mistake as\npeople working on the set.\nAs the number of actors\nincreases it becomes clear\nthat this is a part of the\nplay, and soon they are\nall dancing. The dance\nbecomes a battle which\nsets the hostile atmosphere that will remain\nthroughout the play\u2019s\nthree hour run-time.\n\u201cThe hostile\natmosphere is\nestablished at\nthe start, and\ncontinues for\nthe three-hour\nruntime\u201d\nwondering if this was not\nonly the end of the act,\nbut of the play itself. It is\na well needed pause, and\nwith some time to reflect\nover all the impressions\nfrom the first act, I re-en-tered the theatre curious,\nbut also anxious, pondering what was to come.\nThe second act was much\nmore enjoyable. The\nintensity grew as the play\nprogressed \u2013 interactions\nwith the audience, more\nand more complicated\nrevenges, and a severed\nlimb here and there kept\nthe audience more than\nawake.\nThere is a duality of\nemotions and how the\nactors portray their characters in Titus Andronicus.\nAn example is Saturninus,\nthe man who in the beginning is elected as the next\nemperor of Rome. With\nhis political speeches and\nclassy blue suits Saturninus resembles any modern\nday politician. The most\npowerful man of the\ncountry is, however, ridiculed almost throughout\nthe whole play. The charismatic and secure man in\nfront of the camera\u2019s lens\nis, behind closed doors,\njust another insecure fool\nin Superman pyjamas.\nThe contrast between\nthe public and private\nway of acting among the\ncharacters is a recurring\ntheme: all the characters,\nincluding Titus himself,\nact strangely from time\nto time, providing the\naudience with a great\nlaugh, but also giving us\nopportunity to reflect on\nthe acts of our own era\u2019s\ninfluential people.\nThe whole play is set\nin an environment that\nreminds us more of our\nown time than historical\nRome: cameramen run\naround capturing political\nevents, people in the\ncrowd take selfies, and\na \u201cDeliveroma\u201d man\ndelivers messages. The\nfamiliar setting makes the\nplay, with all its horror\nand brutality, more relat-able for the audience, and\nallows us to compare and\nquestion the similarities\nand differences between\nour modern society and\nthe play itself. There is\na comfort in knowing\nthat, despite how terrible\nthe political situation in\nthe world might seem,\nwe will never reach the\nsame level of insanity as\nin Titus Andronicus. But\nif we dig deeper in our\nanalysis we soon see how\nkeeping all the factors\nthat makes it an enjoyable\nplay.\nThe two things that\nstick in my memories\nof the play are brutality and, surprisingly,\nlaughter. Laughter is a\nregular reaction from the\naudience, probably just\nas regular as the killing.\nTitus Andronicus is a\ntruly entertaining play:\nthe acting, the interaction\nwith the audience, the\nsmall comments \u2013 it all\nadds up to a humour that\nis necessary in order to\ndeal with all the death and\nunpleasant events of this\nplay. Whether you want\nto analyse the political\nsituation and acts of the\ncharacters in this play, or\nwent purely just to have a\ngood time, Titus Andronicus has something for\nyou. Though I would not\nrecommend it if you\u2019re\nnot the biggest fan of\nblood, despite the fact that\nit\u2019s pretty morbid from\ntime to time, it remains\nthe funniest tragedy I have\never seen.\nTitus brings law and order to Union Council // Helen Maybanks\nARTS\nFRIDAY, 12TH\nJANUARY, 2017 FELIX\n12\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPinocchio ends up a little wooden\u2026\nT\nhe National\nTheatre\u2019s winter\np r o d u c t i o n\nof Pinocchio\nis based on the 1940\nDisney film, including\nsongs from the original.\nBroadly following the\noriginal, it adds in some\nminor changes: Gepetto,\nthe old and lonely puppet\nmaker, longs for a child\nof his own even as he\ncreates puppets for other\nchildren. He is visited\nby The Blue Fairy who\ncommissions him to make\na puppet boy from the tree\nshe has brought with her,\nand, as Gepetto carves\nout the puppet, he comes\nto life. Gepetto names the\npuppet boy Pinocchio and\ndecides to raise him as his\nown; Pinocchio, like in the\nDisney film, is fascinated\nby the human children he\nsees playing and longs to\nbe a \u2018real boy\u2019.\nThe story boils down to\nPinocchio\u2019s quest to find\nout what humanity really\nmeans, and, in doing so,\nto become human. This\nproduction plays with this\nconcept in an interesting\nway: the human characters like Gepetto and\nStromboli, a travelling\ncircus owner who imprisons Pinocchio during his\nquest, are all portrayed by\ngiant puppets, operated\nby actors, one of whom\nprovides the voice. In\ncontract, Pinocchio, our\npuppet protagonist, is\nplayed traditionally by a\nsingle actor. This creates\na great contrast and really\nbrings out the essence of\nthe story, highlighting the\ndifference between man\nand puppet by flipping\ntheir portrayal. It\u2019s unfortunate that the production\ndoesn\u2019t fully commit to\nthis idea: although The\nBlue Fairy is a puppet in\nher first appearance, in\nsubsequent scenes she is\nplayed by a single actor,\nwhich somewhat ruins\nthe effect established in\nthe beginning scenes.\nSimilarly, The Fox, a\nmalicious being who\nseeks to trick Pinocchio,\nis also played by a single\nactor, and these scenes\nlack the effect created by\nthe scenes with Gepetto\nand Pinocchio \u2013 you can\u2019t\nhelp but think that The\nFox as a puppet may have\nbeen more menacing.\nThe plot deviates only\nslightly from the Disney\nfilm, but somehow\nmanages to feel worn out\nand predictable. Perhaps\nit\u2019s because the basic\nstory is one that we have\nseen told over and over\nagain in other media, but\nthe production fails to\nexcite. Pinocchio leaves\nhis father in search of\nmeaning and adventure,\nonly to realise that the true\nmeaning of humanity lies\nin his father\u2019s love. The\nscript, by Dennis Kelly,\nadds nothing of substance\nto the bare bones of the\ntale \u2013 almost every line is\npredictable and many of\nthe key moments fall flat.\nYoung children will likely\nstill enjoy it, but adults ac-Fairy as Pinocchio\u2019s conscience and companion.\nShe manages to convey\nemotion and real character through her voice\nalone, all whilst handling\nthe character\u2019s puppet.\nUnfortunately, many of\nthe other actors fall far\nshort of Bisson\u2019s perfor-mance. Mark Hadfield\u2019s\nperformance as Gepetto\nis by no means poor and,\nin an ordinary portrayal,\nmay well have been quite\nengaging. However, his\nvoice acting fails to bring\nthe puppet Gepetto to life\nthe way Bisson does for\nJiminy. The \u2018non-puppet\u2019\nactors \u2013 Joe Idris-Roberts\nas Pinocchio and David\nLangham as The Fox \u2013\nare both rather weak;:they\ndeliver overexaggerated\nperformances clearly\naimed to appeal to a young\nchild audience. However,\nit detracts from the story\nand only draws attention\nto the poor script.\nThere is still a lot to be\nsaid for this production,\nhowever. The effects are\nimpressive and you can\u2019t\nhelp but marvel at the\ntechnical genius behind\nit. Monstro, a giant whale,\nis impressively created\non stage, and the moment\nwhere Pinocchio and\nJiminy are swallowed\nby the whale is visually\nstriking \u2013 one of the\nbest of the performance.\nMartin Lowe\u2019s score is\nbased on the songs from\nthe film, but adapted\nto better suit this stage\nversion. All of the musical\nperformances are without\nfault, and really carry the\nentire production.\nIt\u2019s a real pity that the\nscript and acting let down\nthe many great aspects of\nthis production. The use\nof giant puppets to portray\nhuman characters is such\na fitting choice for this\nstory and has real potential to be impressive, and\nthere are certainly some\nstandout moments. Ultimately though, it fails to\ncreate any real emotional\nimpact and you\u2019re left\nfeeling indifferent, even\nin the grand climax of\nPinocchio\u2019s quest.\nTheNationalTheatre\u2019sproductionhasgreateffects,andacrackingscore,butapoorscriptandinconsistentacting\nmean it fails to ignite.\nIf you\u2019re not a fan of puppets, you should look away now\u2026 // Manuel Harlan\nVaishnavi\nGnanananthan\nArts Writer\nARTS\nWhere?

An area we\ncall the Twilight Zone.\u201d\nAmidst all the Christmas shows and pantomimes filling theatres in\nDecember, the Almeida\nTheatre takes on this brave\nadaptation of the early\n1960s American sci-fi TV\nseries. I\u2019d never watched\nthe original show, but\nbeing a fan of old sci-fi,\nI couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity to see how a cult\nshow could translate from\nscreen to stage. I have to\nadmit, my expectations\nwere high: the Almeida\u2019s\nminimalist posters and\ncryptic descriptions had\npiqued my interest.\nAmerican playwright\nAnne Washburn adapts\neight separate episodes\nof the 150-episode TV\nseries but chooses to\nstring them together as a\nwhole. Different stories\nintertwine and intersect:\na mysterious alien guest\nhas creeped into a diner\nin a snowstorm; a young\ngirl gets whisked from\nher bedroom and trapped\nin between dimensions;\nastronauts just returned\nto Earth start to vanish\none by one. These are just\nthree of the eight episodes,\nand it already sounds like\nan eclectic mix of stories\nthat couldn\u2019t possible\nform a cohesive whole.\nBut, somehow, Washburn\nmanages to achieve just\nthat: she jumps between\nstories with ease \u2013 never\nin a way that seems\nconfused or unintentional \u2013 to create something\ntruly unique.\nThe real standout is\nthe final story: a nuclear\nthreat and everyone\u2019s\nconsequent race to save\nthemselves bring to light\nracial tensions between\nneighbours in an otherwise idyllic suburb.\nA black couple, a white\ncouple, and a Jewish\nimmigrant break into a\nfierce fight over who has\nthe most right to their\nfriend\u2019s nuclear bunker,\none into which they are\ntrying to force their way.\nIt brings up ideas on what\nit is to be American, as\neach individual argues\ntheir superior claim, high\u201cSomehow,\ndirector Anne\nWashburn\nmanages to\njump between\nstories with\nease\u201d\n\u201cThe acting\nreally captures\nthe cheesy\nvibe of late-50s/early-60s\ntelevision\u201d\nlighting the absurdity of\nnationalism and drawing\nnot-so-subtle comparisons to the present day.\nOpinion might vary on\nwhether this is timely and\ntopical or an exploitation of a subject that, at\npresent, seems ubiquitous\nin the media. Personally,\nit felt apt \u2013 the nuclear\nthreat characterised the\nearly 60s captures the\nessence of the time period\nof the show whilst being\nundeniably relevant to the\naudience seeing it today.\nThere are obviously\nfond references to the\noriginal show that were,\nas a Twilight Zone novice,\na little lost upon me, but\nthis doesn\u2019t really hamper\nenjoyment, and most of\nthe references are enjoyable as jokes in their own\nright. One running gag\nacross the stories features\nmysteriously appearing\ncigarettes, what I later\nlearned to be a reference\nto the constant smoking in\nthe original show. Knowledge of the original show\ndoes clearly make this\nfunnier, but it\u2019s played in\nsuch a way that it becomes\na joke in its own right.\nThe stage is set up to\nlook like an old TV set,\ncomplete with the CBS\nlogo every time the curtain\nis down. The original\nshow was in black and\nwhite, and this production\nsticks to that aesthetic,\nwith a black backdrop\ncovered in white stars and\na cast dressed primarily\nin black and white. I\nwas a massive fan of the\naesthetic and, especially,\nthe 50s and 60s outfits of\nthe cast. The staging of\nthe play is part tribute and\npart parody, and \u2013 perhaps\ninevitably, considering its\nsource material \u2013 often\nvery, very weird. There\nare moments when actors\nin black jumpsuits and\ngoggles carry cardboard\nimages across the stage\nin an imitation of opening\nand closing credits \u2013 it\nsounds bizarre but it\u2019s\nundeniable that it works.\nIt manages to hit the right\nbalance between genuine\nimitation and parody so\nthat, with the appropriate\nsuspension of disbelief,\nyou can buy into it.\nThe cast is great: the\nactors play multiple roles\nacross the different stories,\nand no single person really\nstands out. But this seems\nalmost like a conscious\neffort that makes it feel\nmore like a TV show with\nan ensemble cast rather\nthan the heavy focus on\na few leads that we more\ncommonly see in theatre.\nThere are obviously flaws,\nbut honestly, they just add\nto the character of the\nperformance. The uniform\noveracting from the cast\ncaptures the cheesy late\n50s/early 60s vibe and\nmakes you feel like you\u2019re\nreally watching television\nenacted before you \u2013 a\nshow within a show in the\nbest way.\nI left the performance\ndetermined to start\nwatching the original\nshow, at least to see the\neight episodes adapted,\nbut knowing, in the back\nof my guilty mind, that it\nwas all too likely I would\nend up binging all 150\nepisodes over my Christmas holiday. If the idea\nof all that time lost to TV\ndoesn\u2019t scare you, or if\nyou\u2019re already a die-hard\nfan of the TV series, this\nadaptation of The Twilight\nZone is one not to be\nmissed.\nDo you dare to go through\u2026 The Scary Door // Marc Brenner\nARTS\nVaishnavi\nGnanananthan\nArts Writer\nWhere?
