In addition, I\nwill also apologise for\nmy emotional language\nin the previous paragraph\nif that negatively affected\nany of you reading the\narticle. I hope it was not\nan insult to anyone, and\nas Mr. Titmuss \u201crespectfully\u201d pointed out in his\nresponse, I was in overwhelming rage.\nLast week when I\nwas first replied by Mr.\nHenry Alman who is the\nFelix editor, I started to\nunderstand how press in\nthe UK works. I appreciate that it provides a\nplatform where students\ncan express their genuine\nopinion. However, it is\nquite different from press\nin China as I feel there\nis no censorship at all.\nTherefore, I wrote down\nsome of my opinions from\na Chinese perspective\nand sent to Mr. Alman in\none of the email, and the\ncontents were as follows:\n1. Felix should take\nsome responsibility to\ncheck whether the content\npublished is objective,\ntruthful, and respectful to\nthe communities involved\n2. If someone wants\nto use the British way to\njudge other countries, not\nonly China, it is much\nmore appropriate to\nconsult that community if\nthat is acceptable\nThe request about an\napology made by Felix\nwas never mentioned\nagain as I respect that\nFelix takes an absolutely\nneutral and objective\nposition, and I would like\nto thank Mr. Alman for\nspending his time letting\nme know about Felix\u2019s\nposition. However, I insist\nthat Mr. Titmuss should\napologise for this.\nThis article aims to\nrespond to Mr. Titmuss\u2019s\nsecond article, which\nresponded to my first\narticle. As this starts to\nbecome a debate, I would\nlike to first briefly summarise some key points what\nMr. Titmuss argued in his\nsecond article to help both\nthe audience and myself\nto understand what is\ngoing on.\n1. My previous article\nis an \u201cinsult to logic\u201d\nbecause I relied on\noverwhelming personal\noutrage\n2. Mr. Titmuss made\n\u201creasonable points\u201d in his\nsecond article\n3. I cited \u201cYoutube\u201d\nand that can be ignored as\nit is not a reliable source\n4. The Chinese government is oppressive as\nit does following things:\n- So-called \u201cre-education\ncamps\u201d-Suspectedselling\norgans from executed\npolitical prisoners - Great\nFirewall on the internet\n- Preventing people in\nChina exercising freedom\nof speech - China attempts\nto extend censorship to\nother countries\n5. I was acting on\nbehalf of the Chinese\ngovernment and aimed to\nplease Beijing\nTo the first point, it\nis up to your audiences\nto judge if I was logical\nor not, but I believe that\nrage does not necessarily\nmake someone irrational,\nso let see what \u201creasonable points\u201d Mr. Titmuss\nhave. Oh wait, as this\nis a response to my first\narticle, did he argue back?\nI will list some of my\narguments below:\n1. The exercise of\nfreedom of speech carries\n6. Differences between\nChinese and Western\nvalues must be recognised\n7. Some recommendations to help readers learn\nabout China\nIt seems that Mr.\nTitmuss only replied the\nthird and the seventh\npoint, so I will start my\narguments address these\ntwo.\nThe so-called \u201cre-education camps,\u201d or\nwhat ever you call it,\nhas nothing to do with\ndiminishing the position\nof minorities in Xinjiang\nprovince. Xinjiang\nprovince is located near\nAfghanistan, and has\nlong been influenced by\nextremist Muslims and\nterrorism. These facilities\naim to provide professional training to those\nwho have been influenced\nby terrorism but haven\u2019t\nreached the level of\ncommitting crimes so that\nthese people can go back\nto the society, work, and\nearn their lives. As there\nis potential of terrorist\nactivities, safety insurances in these facilities\nare necessary. I watched\nBBC\u2019s report on these\nfacilities on Youtube, yes,\nYoutube again, and many\nthings that the journalist\nfound astonishing are\nactually quite common in\nChina such as uniforms,\n10 people sharing a room\n(actually some Chinese\nuniversities still have facilities of similar level). If\nthis practice is inhumane,\nwell, probably we should\nlearn from the UK,\nsending fighters to bomb\nthe terrorists when they\nhave activities, kill them\nall and possibly some\ncivilians?\nI don\u2019t know how there\ncould be such a ridiculous\nProtesters and Police Stand Off in Hong Kong // Wikimedia\nspecial duties and responsibilities for the rights or\nreputation of others and\nthe protection of national\nsecurity\n2. I respect any rational\nand peaceful attempts\nmade by Hong Kong\npeople for calling for\nwhat they want, but what\nis happening in Hong\nKong is neither rational\nnor peaceful\n3. China is not oppressive as pictured by\nwestern media\n4. Misunderstandings\nof westerners about China\n5. It would be wrong,\ndisrespectful and irresponsible if someone wants to\njudge China without truly\nknowing about China\n\n"

It\u2019s frequently\ntossed in my face during\nmy occasional indulgences in internet flame wars\non one of my favourite\nFacebook groups \u2013 a\ngem called \u201cItalians Mad\nat Food \u2013 The Group\u201d,\nwhich I thoroughly advise\nfollowing.\nWell, this week I\ndearly want to disabuse\nyou of this notion. Food\nis, thankfully, one of the\nfew areas in which one\ncan have national pride\nthese days without being\nconstrued as a madman.\nUs Brits don\u2019t really do\npatriotism, anymore \u2013\nwe\u2019re far too obsessed\nwith self-deprecatingly\nripping on ourselves in\nan orgy of masochistic\nself-loathing, like the\nproper stiff upper-lipped\ngents and ladies we are\n\u2013 but goddamn do I feel\njust fine standing up and\nsaying that Eton Mess is\neffing delicious.\nI think the conception\nlargely stems from the\nperhaps blander palettes\nof the war generation \u2013 a\ngroup of men and women\nso stoic in the face of the\nGerman war machine that\nthey even sacrificed their\ntastebuds. Yes, a generation of people raised on\nrations as children and\ndenied the simple pleasures of salt and pepper\nmight occasionally under-season their meat. We all\nadjust to favour the flavours we consume when\nwe are young. The payoff\nis that they\u2019ll all live until\nthey\u2019re 109, while I will\ngo out in a blaze of failing\ncardiovascular glory at\nthe tender age of 35. Wait,\nI smoke as well \u2013 make\nthat 33.\nFor some reason, this\nparticular subset of British\ncuisine \u2013 the undersea-soned and overboiled\nvegetables with a slab of\ntough meat and potatoes\n\u2013 has become conflated\nwith the concept of British\nfood itself. While, yes, it\ndoes make up a decent\nportion of our diets, it\ndoesn\u2019t really make sense\nto conflate it with modern\nBritish food.\nAfter all, modern\nBritish food is pretty\ngreat. We have the resurgence of old industries,\nespecially dairy \u2013 did you\nknow that Britain has one\nof, if not the, broadest and\nmost diverse selections\nof cheeses produced here\nin the world? If I recall\ncorrectly, it even outstrips\nFrance. (No, I won\u2019t fact\ncheck that \u2013 this is an\nEditorial written on a\nThursday evening. Take\nme to prison for my gross\nbreaches of freedom of\nspeech.) Cheese is great.\nI haven\u2019t met many\npeople who can honestly\nsay they find meals\nlike Eton Mess, Beef\nWellington, a well-made\nfull English breakfast, or\nsteak pie to be conceptually gross or bland meals.\nThey\u2019re the quintessential\nBritish dishes, and yet\nthe cuisine they are from\nis considered tainted by\nthis image of blandness. It\ndoesn\u2019t make sense to me.\nOf course, the most\nexciting aspect of British\nfood by far is fusion food.\nPersonally, I see this as\nmuch British cuisine as\nmeals eaten here for thousands of years. I believe\nthat anybody born here\nis British, and meals like\nChicken Tikka Masala \u2013\nnow a national dish \u2013 that\nwere developed by British\npeople in Britain don\u2019t\nbecome not-British-food\nbecause their parents\ncame from somewhere\nelse. That\u2019s just my take.\nAnd this is, without\nquestion, the most\nexciting place to be to\nexperience fusion food in\nits wonderful variety. The\nlargescale immigration\nwe have into the British\nIsles has led to a lot of\nmulticultural diversity.\nI\u2019ve been to a lot of cities\naround the world, and in\nvery few \u2013 if any \u2013 could\nyou walk down a street\nin the centre of town and\ncome across the same incredible range of cuisines\nyou get spread across\none block in London. We\ntreasure and value food\nfrom everywhere, from\nFrance to India to Korea\nto Chile, and our most\nexciting developments in\ncuisine are coming from\nthis particularly marvellous sector. It\u2019s awesome\nto watch in action.\nIt\u2019s rare that I\u2019d use\nsomething as seemingly\ntrivial as food to justify\ntaking a serious political\nstance, but truly \u2013 if\nglobalisation has led to\nsuch amazing growth and\nchange in the world of\nfood, I take that as a fairly\nconvincing argument to\nremain in the EU. More\nconvincing than anything\nI\u2019ve heard out of a politician\u2019s gaping mouthhole\nin quite some time,\nanyway.\nWhat\u2019s particularly\nawesome is that in the\nUK, it isn\u2019t spectacle. It\nisn\u2019t limited to top-end\nrestaurants or cheap\ntakeaways. This variety\nof food is carried into our\nhomes. What we cook in\nthe average week contains\nelements of cuisines and\ningredients from every\ncorner of the world. I\u2019d\ncomfortably have ramen,\ncurry, and tacos on the\nsame day, all prepared\nwith my own hands in my\nown kitchen.\nThe area in which\nwe fail, in the UK \u2013 and\nperhaps where all the bad\nconceptions come from \u2013\nis that we don\u2019t seem to\ncarry our passion for food\ninto a passion for cooking.\nI am, of course, referring\nto the ready meals aisle.\nWe do not set aside time\nin our days to cook and\nprepare food. We do not\ngo home for lunch. We eat\na ludicrously overpriced\npremade Tesco sandwich\nat our desks, instead. We\nbuy ready meals on the\nway home from work.\nWe\u2019re tired so we bang\nsomething in the oven, or\nrun down the local chippy.\nIt\u2019s a shame, and a\nshame I\u2019m very guilty of\nsharing. I cannot count\nthe number of blooming\nBurger Kings I\u2019ve eaten at\n2 AM over the past couple\nof months, during late\nnight shifts at the office.\nHell, I will probably end\nup doing the same tonight.\nThis is, however, a\nfailure of Britain\u2019s food\nculture \u2013 not of British\nfood!\nFront Cover // Taja Strle\nI\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nFRIDAY, 22ND\nNOVEMBER, 2019\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n20\nThe King (2019)\nI\nwould like to preface this by saying\nthat under usual\ncircumstances, this\nis probably not a film\nI would be inclined to\nwatch, however, as a\nresult of my undying\nlove for Robert Pattinson,\nI have been somewhat\nanticipating the release of\nThe King since watching\nits trailer. And whilst my\nlove for Robert remains\nstrong, I think I was correct in presuming that this\ntype of film isn\u2019t really my\ncup of tea. Though don\u2019t\nget confused into thinking\nI am saying this is a bad\nfilm, it isn\u2019t \u2013 at the worst,\nit is average, and in some\naspects, rather good.\nThe film follows \u201cHal\u201d\n(Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet), son\nof King Henry IV, and his\nsudden ascension to the\nthrone to become King\nHenry V of England.\nIntent on having a much\nless violent reign than\nhis father, Hal starts out\ngentle, but after some\npushing from his closest\nadvisors, he is forced to\ndeclare war on France.\nBased on multiple plays\nin Shakespeare\u2019s Henriad,\nthe film isn\u2019t historically\naccurate, which was\nobvious enough when\nwatching it.\nPersonally, I found the\nhalf-hearted Shakespearean language jarring, and\nthe script, which was\nslightly lacking, didn\u2019t\nmake up for it. I thought\nthe development and\ncoming-of-age of Hal\ncould have been fleshed\nout more, but instead we\nsaw him go from the 15th\ncentury\u2019s version of a\nparty boy to a war-waging\nking almost at the flick\nof a switch. Nonetheless,\nChalamet\u2019s acting was\ndefinitely the strong point\nof this film. Timoth\u00e9e\nhas proved that he is an\nincredibly skilled actor\nbefore now and he doesn\u2019t\nfail to showcase this\nand domineering, even\nwhen he isn\u2019t speaking.\nWhether that is due to his\ngood looks or transfixing\nstare, I don\u2019t know. But\nChalamet\u2019s acting isn\u2019t\nthe only one worthy or\npraise: Pattinson\u2019s appearance as the Dauphin\nof France, although brief,\nadded to the film, even if\nit was simply through a\nbit of comic relief with his\nlaughable French accent\nand some well executed\nlines. But more impor-tantly, Joel Edgerton\u2019s\ncharacter Falstaff, Hal\u2019s\nclosest friend, was done\nperfectly, with Edgerton\nsimply melting into the\nrole.\nThe King started off\nslow and, in my opinion,\nwas a bit too long, but\nthe last 40 minutes or\nso, containing a gripping\nsequence of the Battle of\nAgincourt, proved rather\nenjoyable. If I was to\nwatch a Netflix original,\nwhich The King is, a\nlittle over a year ago, I\nundoubtedly would have\nentered the film with low\nexpectations (justified or\nnot). But since watching\nRoma \u2013 a fantastic Oscar-nominated Netflix\nrelease of last year, I have\ngained more confidence\nin Netflix as a production\ncompany and believed\nthis film had the potential\nto be decent, which it is. If\nyou enjoy medieval films,\nthis is definitely worth a\nwatch, but if you\u2019re like\nme and like your films\nto have some chunky\ncharacter development, I\ndoubt you\u2019d be singing its\npraises.\nBig Fish (2003)\nS\nearching for a\nheart-warming\nfilm to watch\non a November\nevening in an attempt to\ncombat mid-term blues,\nI came across Big Fish,\na childhood classic. I\ndid remember it was\nentertaining and uplifting,\nbut having seen it such a\nwhile ago, I had forgotten\nsome twists and details of\nthe storyline. I checked\nif it has stood the test\nof time \u2013 and I was not\ndisappointed.\nSet in two different\ntimelines, the film tells a\nstory of Will who reunites\nwith his terminally ill\nfather, Edward, and has\none last chance to hear\nwhat the real story of his\nearly days was. Blinded\nfor so many years by\nsurreal tales, Will is desperate to prove that his\nfather made them up and\nin fact lived an ordinary\nlife.\nEdward\u2019s stories are\nindeed bizarre, in true\nTim Burton style \u2013 it is\na weird gallery of giants,\nwitches, circus artists,\npresented with a good\ndeal of slapstick humour\n(which my 8-year-old\nself probably found more\nhilarious). That said, one\ncould expect something\nexplicitly darker from the\ndirector of Corpse Bride\nand Sweeney Todd, while\nthis is (for the most part)\na sweet, feel-good film.\nIts seriousness, however,\nis hidden in plain sight.\nAfter all, Big Fish\ntackles resolving a family\nconflict at the end of life\nand contains some very\npoignant scenes. Will,\nonce convinced his father\nis nothing more than an\negocentric mythomaniac,\ngradually discovers\nthat when real life gets\ndaunting, these extraordinary tales are what let\nyou escape. They are also\nwhat is left once you are\ngone.\nWhat I forgot since I\nlast watched it, is the fact\nthat young Edward Bloom\nis portrayed by Ewan\nMcGregor, and that he\nis by far one of the most\nlikeable and admirable\ncharacters you will ever\nsee on the screen. From\nthe supporting line-up\nof Hollywood stars,\nSteve Buscemi\u2019s role as\na frustrated poet is the\nmost absurd \u2013 it goes well\nbeyond a stereotypical\nfairy tale character.\nIf you need an extra\npush to get you through\nto Christmas or just an\nexcuse for a study break,\nwatch Big Fish. 15 years\nafter its release in the\nUK it is as touching and\npeculiar as ever.\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet as The King // Netflix\nFILM\nCharlotte Arrand\nFilm Editor\nDirector: David Michod\nScript: David Michod,\nJoel Edgerton Starring:\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet,\nJoel Edgerton, Robert\nPattinson 140 minutes\nTHE KING\nFILM\nZuzanna Janusz\nFilm Writer\nDir: Tim Burton.

Sporting an\nEnglish accent and noble\nlook, he makes a convincing king; his screen\npresence is compelling\nDaydreaming in daffodils// Columbia Pictures\n\n"

If we use logic\n(which I am probably\nlacking according to Mr.\nTitmuss), the Chinese\ngovernment is oppressive\nand has absolute control\non everything, why would\nit care about the few\norgans from an executed\nprisoner? There are loads\nof ways that the government can make money,\nmuch more than selling\norgans, so why would\nChinese government\ndo that? Besides, Mr.\nTitmuss used the word\n\u201csuspected.\u201d If anyone\nan accuse others just\nbecause they are suspected of doing something, oh\nwell, I don\u2019t know what I\nshould say. Oh wait, the\nUK actually did this right?\nThe UK and the US suspected Iraq had weapons\nof mass destruction and\nbombed it completely.\nDid they find anything?\nWhat was that substance\ndisplayed in UNSC? Are\nyou sure it is biochemical\nweapons rather than some\nwashing powder? I was\nvery curious about this\nrumour so I did some\nresearch, and what I found\nis that executed prisoners\nwas a major source of\norgans few decades ago\nbecause by that time\norgan donation was extremely rare among the\npublic be the demand was\nhigh. However, by law\n(this law has expired), the\nuse of prisoners\u2019 organs\nmust meet the following\nrequirements first (there is\nno official translation so I\ntranslated it):\n1. No one claims the\ncorpse\n2. The family refuses\nto claim the corpse\n3. The executed\nprisoner agrees to donate\nif either 1 or 2 is met\n4. The executed\nprisoner and his/her\nfamily agree to donate\nHowever, there were\nproblems indeed. Corruption was a huge problem\nback in time and this was\nindeed a source of making\ngood amount of money for\nsome corrupted officials,\nbut the evilness of some\ncorrupted should not be\nthe only information used\nto judge China as a whole.\nNow the selling of organs\nhas become a crime and\nis subject to serious pros-ecution. No country is\nperfect, including China,\nbut we are willing to\nresolve the problems and\nchange practices when the\nsituation allows.\nThe Great Firewall is\nwhat we Chinese call a\ndouble blade. I would\nsay it causes problem on\nChinese people some-times. I took the IB during\nhigh school and I had to\nwrite loads of papers in\nEnglish. It was quite a pain\nas some contents cannot\nbe accessed from China.\nHowever, I firmly believe\nthat the benefits brought\nby the wall outweighs.\nOutside this firewall, what\nI saw are medias such as\nthe Big Bad China, or\nsorry, the British Broadcasting Corporation,\nspreading distorted facts\nabout China. What\u2019s\nmore, corporations such\nas Facebook encourage\nthe terrorism, hate, and\nseparatism in China. The\nfirewall ensures that most\ninformation we get are\npositive, and prevents\nterrorism. All Chinese\npeople therefore have\ncommon cause, which is\nmaking China prosperous.\nThe firewall creates\nfeasibility for censorship,\nand again, its benefits\noutweigh the cost.\nAs mentioned above,\ninappropriate content\ncontaining separatism,\nterrorism, hate are automatically filtered. If not,\nthe police can find the\nperson and prevent any\npotential adverse con-sequences. Mr. Titmuss\nmay argue that the CCP\ntries to brainwash Chinese\npeople. Well, I think this\nis not a serious problem\nas we are brainwashed to\nbelieve that we can make\nour homeland better by\nworking hard and uniting\ntogether as a country.\nIt is better than being\nbrainwashed by western\nmedias to believe China is\nbad and we should launch\na revolution to take over\nCCP.\nAbout the freedom of\nspeech, I have cited the\nICCPR twice in this and\nthe previous article. In\nChina, behaviours like Mr.\nTitmuss have, spreading\nrumours without evidence\non organ selling, will be\nquestioned by the police\nand punished. Criticising\nthe government with facts\nwill not be punished in any\nways. I wrote an article\ncriticising the inefficiency\nof the urban management\nand law enforcement department in the city where\nI went to high school.\nI posted it on WeChat\nwhich is a Chinese version\nFacebook and nothing\nhappened to me. So here\nI will just reemphasise to\nMr. Titmuss that it is not a\nproblem to criticise China\non what you believed\nit has done. Show me\nevidence.\nChina has no interest\nto implant its influence\nin any other countries.\nAbout foreign companies,\nI had discussed it in\nthe previous article and\nMr. Titmuss made no\nresponse. About foreign\ngovernments, if they don\u2019t\nknow, do not want to\nknow, or choose what they\nreport about Hong Kong,\nwe want them to keep\nmouths shut. If wearing\nmasks in demonstration\n(banned in the UK) and\ncommitting vandalism\nis pro-democratic move-ments, there is certainly\nsome problem with the\nlegal system. It is disgusting that the UK when it\ncolonised Hong Kong,\nshot locals when they\nlaunched any movement,\narrest hundreds of them\nand beat some to death in\ncustody, and now criticising China and the Hong\nKong police officers for\nusing arms without killing\nanyone while facing the\nbrutal rioters. I suppose\nMr. Titmuss has never\nheard of this, just as I\nwould never heard what\nhappened in 4th of June,\n1989. Sadly Mr. Titmuss\nmade a wrong assumption.\nI know about that, I know\nthere were people killed,\nbut they were rioters\neven worse than what we\nthat has nothing to do with\npleasing Beijing. That is\nmy responsibility, even if\nthe government does not\nissue that morality guide-line. In addition, I want\nto have another message\nspread, which is try to\nlearn about China from\na different perspective. I\nhave come to London for\nmore than a month but\nI don\u2019t criticise the UK\nbecause I know I don\u2019t\nknow enough about it. I\nwill not easily criticise\nBritish politics until I\ncompletely understand\nBritish ways of doing\nthings (which probably\nI will never achieve). I\nsuppose Mr. Titmuss has\nnever stayed in China for\nmore than one month, and\nhas never conducted any\nresearch on how Chinese\npeople feel about the gov-ernment. I recommended\ntwo sources to help you\nreaders learn about China,\nincluding Mr. Titmuss, but\nhe declined the Youtube\none and I suppose he has\nnever read On China.\nHowever, he does not\nstop publishing biased,\nirresponsible, insulting,\nand humiliating contents.\nThat demonstrates his\narrogance.\nShortly I will conclude\nthis article that is probably\n\u201clack of logic\u201d and \u201caims\nto please Beijing.\u201d It will\ntake another thousand\nof words if I refute Mr.\nTitmuss point by point.\nHowever, the most\nimportant message that\nI want you readers to\nknow is starting to learn\nabout China from another\nperspective. There are\nmany Chinese students\nat Imperial, and they will\ntell you about a China that\nyou will never know from\nthe medias. If you don\u2019t\nwant to learn about China,\nthat\u2019s also great, but please\ndo not criticise China\nunless you have substantial evidence (do not trust\nthe media). Lastly, Mr.\nTitmuss, shame on you for\nliving in a country that has\nEngland, Wales, Scotland,\nand Northern Ireland as\nconstituents but being a\nsupporter for separatism.\n\u201cRioters in\nTiananmen\nSquare were\neven worse...\u201d\nsee in Hong Kong today.\nSoldiers beaten to death\non street, and the rioters\nburned their corpses and\nhanged them on street\nlamps. You will not know\nabout it because BBC\ndoesn\u2019t want to tell you.\nBy writing these\narticles, I am not on behalf\nof the government, but of\nmyself only. I mentioned\nthe difference in values\nbetween the west and\nChina, and being loyal\nto the country has been\na virtue for thousands of\nyears in China. I wrote\nthe articles to defend the\nreputation of China, but\n\n"

What Crisis?: How to Save a Minority\nGovernment or Die Trying\nT\nhe government\nhas no working majority,\nmillions are protesting on the street and\neconomic catastrophe\nseems imminent. Sound\nfamiliar? Well, the year is\n1979: in the midst of mass\nindustrial action and the\ncoldest winter in two dec-ades, the Labour Party\u2019s\ngrip on power hangs in the\nbalance, and it\u2019s up to you\nto save it.\nNo, literally. This is\nan immersive production\n- every decision made\nduring the course of the\nnight is up to you and your\nfellow theatregoers, so it\u2019s\nbest to get your armchair\npolitician out. The instant\nyou get into the control\nroom (a condensed\nWhitehall, replete with\n70s decor and serviced\nby a fax machine) a Party\nmembership card is thrust\ninto your hands, a few\nlight pleasantries ex-changed, and you\u2019re given\n150 minutes to stop the\ngovernment from falling.\nAnd what a state it\u2019s\nin: tonight\u2019s the night of a\nvote of no confidence; the\nlorry drivers are on strike,\nwith nearly every sector\nof the industrial economy\nlooking to follow suit;\nmartial law is hours\nfrom being declared; and\nnobody\u2019s even bothered to\nclean away the cigarette\nstubs and apple cores\ncovering the table. If you\nthink this all seems too\nmuch to solve in a single\nnight, you\u2019re completely\nright - and that\u2019s what\nmakes Crisis? What\nCrisis? such unabashed\nfun. Once HQ\u2019s been\ntidied, it\u2019s entertainment\nas a spinning plates act:\nin a single flourish, you\ncan start a trade war with\nthe United States, join\nthe Soviet Bloc, or get\nJunta\u2019d by the British\nMilitary as you reel from\none crisis to another.\nThis is a pre-Thatcherite\nworld of trade unions,\nand correspondingly\nmuch of the night is spent\nappeasing one sector of\nthe economy only to stir\nanother into open revolt -the experience of getting\nroundly hammered by a\ndead-red union leader at\nthe negotiating table (a\nmore humbling turn-of-events than I can possibly\nexpress) alone justifies the\nticket price.\nSo it turns out governing is hard, and for\nall our idle speculation\nit\u2019s easy to forget that\ngood intentions do not\nnecessarily produce good\noutcomes. As enjoyable\nas Crisis? What Crisis? is,\nit might also be the best\nbit of civic education I\u2019ve\never received, even if that\ncomes with the depressing\nrealisation that governmental ineptitude might\nbe the norm rather than\nthe exception - though we\ndid actually end up saving\nthe government, whatever\nthat counts for (of course,\nwithout spoiling anything,\nthere are far more\nentertaining outcomes\npossible). Perhaps the\nonly drawback of the production is that its striking\nverisimilitude rewards a\npassable knowledge of the\nera, so it might be worth\nreading up the Winter of\nDiscontent on Wikipedia\nbefore you go. Still, that\u2019s\nnot the worst pre-show\nrequirement in the world:\nyou know what they say\nabout not learning from\nhistory.\n#WeAreArrested - the brutal reality\n#\nWeAreArrested\nposes some very\nimportant ques-tions. What is the\npower of the press? How\ndo we protect its freedom\nwhen its own government\nacts outside its legal\njurisdiction? This is a\ndeeply personal account\nof a globally relevant\nstory. In such strange\ntimes where lies and truth\nare indistinguishable,\n#WeAreArrested reminds\nus of the importance of in-tegrity, and the mightiness\nof the pen.\nAlmost immediately we\nare thrust into a make-be-lieve meeting room, with\nthree editors debating\nwhether to publish their most\nimpactful story: footage of\nweapons linked to their own\ngovernment being smuggled\ninto a neighbouring nation in\na brutal war. What follows\nis the tale of a corrupt government overstepping its\nlegally designated power.\nIt\u2019s surprising how much this\ntrue story plays out like a\ncrime thriller.\nIn November 2015,\neditor-in-chief Can D\u00fcndar\nand bureau chief Erdem G\u00fcl\nfor Turkish newspaper Cumhuriyet were detained prior\nto their trial for allegedly\n\u201cdivulging state secrets\u201d,\nreferencing a story published\nearlier in the year. For 92\ndays, D\u00fcndar remained\nin solitary confinement,\noppressed by what he called\nto be a \u201clack of colour\u201d. \u201cWe\nAre Arrested\u201d, his memoir\nof this time, is evidence\nthat a free mind cannot be\nimprisoned, that thought and\nself-expression endure.\nThis idea is a recurring\ntheme throughout the\nproduction. There is a truly\nenchanting scene in which\nthe protagonist is imagining\nall his favourite delicacies\nat brunch; a bitter coffee,\nwarm pastries and Buck\u2019s\nFizz. This is followed by him\ndreaming of dancing with\nhis wife one more time, a\nrebellious, careless, intimate\ndance. He finds every opportunity to find pleasure in\nthe smallest things: a cheese\ntoastie cooked between the\ngrills of the radiator, and\nthe blissful few seconds of\nsunlight against his face each\nday.\nThe whole ensemble\ncomes together thanks to\nPeter Hamilton Dyer (as Can\nD\u00fcndar), who is completely\nenthralling. The dialogue\nbounces between speaking\ndirectly to the audience\nand other characters, which\nlimits the other performers\nfrom reaching their potential,\nbut does not detract from an\notherwise wholly captivating\nproduction.\nDespite being heavily\ndrawn from a true story; no\nspecific names or locations\nare given. It is clearly a\nconscious decision to omit\nthese details to let it become\na parable. It is a common\nframe of mind to think that\nhush deals and censorship\nare issues other nations face,\nespecially when sitting in\nthe Arcola Theatre, a couple\nthousand miles from Turkey.\nNevertheless #WeAreArrest-ed is a welcome reminder\nthat power can corrupt.\n\u201cWho knew destroying an economy could be so fun?\u201d // Owen Kingston\nARTS\nFelix Swift Roberts\nArts Writer\nWhere?

    "content": "Imperial College DramSoc Presents: 11 Miles\nB\nased on the real\njournal entries,\n11 Miles follows\nCaptain Scott\u2019s\njourney to the South Pole\nwith his four companions:\nEvans, Wilson, Bowers,\nand Oates. The audience\ncomes to understand\nthe meaning behind \u201c11\nmiles\u201d during the play as\nthey hear about the tragedies that struck the team\non the way back.\nPresented by our very\nown Imperial College\nDramSoc, the intense\nphysical and mental\nhardships endured by the\noriginal explorers were\ncaptured effectively by\nthe actors: Hamish Macdonald, Lucy Chandler,\nAlfred Engedal, Alex\nJones and Annie Knight.\nThroughout the play,\neach character reveals\ntheir own insecurities\nand internal conflicts; the\nacting in those personal\nscenes were incredible.\nFrom Scott feeling\nresponsible for their unexpected circumstances; and\nWilson lack of self-belief\nto Oates\u2019 homesickness,\neach scene exhibited a\ngenuine human side of\nthe characters as they let\nout the pent up emotions.\nThe yelling and disputes\nwithin the team also\nmanifested the level of\nstress and their flawed and\nhuman response to the\nstress they were under was\nsomething the audience\ncould really relate to,\nsome of them with tears in\ntheir eyes.\nDespite taking place\nin a small meeting room,\nthe lighting, designed by\nKacper Neumann, was\nclever and compensated\nfor the limited stage space\nthey had. The scenes\noutside and inside the\ntent were differentiated\nby lighting up the whole\nstage and spotlighting\nthe tent respectively. The\nsound effects, designed\nby Harman Chang, further\nenhanced this transition,\nas they altered the volume\nof the windstorm which\nmade the audience feel as\nif they were sat inside a\nwarm tent or stood outside\nin the extreme cold with\nthe team. The deafening\nstorm added to the tension\non-stage but unfortunately\ndrowned out Scott\u2019s last\nfew lines.\nThe costumes, props\nand set design by Kay\nParker-Hunt and Becky\nRogers were also well\nthought out. The few cans\nof beans had no labels\non and looked rusted,\nemphasising the fact that\nthey were the last sources\nof food the team had left.\nWinter hats and gloves\nwere put on and taken off\nevery time they left and\nreturned to the tent. The\ntent, set in the middle\nof the stage, though\nminimal, played a critical\nrole, portraying the line\nbetween life and death for\nthe team.\nOverall the production\nretold the story of theTerra\nNova Expedition in an\nauthentic and emotionally\ntouching way. Highlighting the personal struggles\nof the team members,\nwhile also focusing on the\nbonds between and sacrifices for each other, 11\nMiles was a professional\nproduction by DramSoc.\nI hope we will have more\nopportunities to see their\ntalent in the future.\nTouching the Void Review\nB\nased on Joe\nS i m p s o n \u2019 s\nmountaineering\nmemoir and\nadapted by David Greig,\nTouching the Void is a\nstory about the adventures\nof Joe and Simon to Siula\nGrande in the Peruvian\nAndes. As the double\nmeaning of the title infers,\nthe significant factor of\nthe play are the feelings\nof the characters and their\nfear of being and dying\nalone. Since people with\nmore ordinary lives also\nshare these emotions, focusing on them so deeply\nmakes the play relatable,\ndistinguishing it from\nother survival stories.\nThe direction is innovative and creative utilising\nminimal props. The tables\nand chairs in a bar become\na foothold, the base camp\nand rocks on a mountain\nroad. The simple set design draws attention to the\ndetails of other parts of\ndesign such as their mountaineering equipment and\nclothing, giving the play\na realistic feel. The audience\u2019s perspective changes as they freely alter the\norientation of the stage. In\nsome scenes, they see the\nvastness of the mountain\nfrom the foot as Sarah, Simon and Richard look up\nto the ceiling of the the-atre, while in others, the\nauditorium is set inside a\ncrevasse, as Joe is hung\nfrom the top of the theatre\nwith a single rope.\nThe astonishing cast of\nfour is the crucial element\nthat makes the complex\nplot, which relies greatly\non the audience\u2019s imagi-nation, work. The hysteria and sorrow provoked\nby Josh William\u2019s (Joe),\nFiona Hampton\u2019s (Joe\u2019s\nsister) and Angus Yellowlees\u2019(Simon) performances contrasted with Patrick\nMcNamee\u2019s (Joe\u2019s com-panion), which brought\ncomic relief to the play\nand laughter to the on-lookers. Joe and Simon\u2019s\nlife-threatening journey\nis represented on an immense metallic and paper\nstructure elevated on stage\nwhich represents the different parts of the moun-tain. They accurately enacted techniques used in\nmountaineering recreates\nthe scene in a way that reminds the crowd of visual\neffects one usually expects from films.\nWith its originality and\ninventiveness, Touching\nthe Void allows the audience to explore Joe and\nSimon\u2019s extraordinary adventure in a thrilling and\nemotive way as it spotlights the limits of human\ntolerance when in peril.\nView of the stage // Jakub B Dranczewski\nISSUE 1735\nFELIX\n15\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nAya Hayakawa\nArts Writer\nWhere?

After two hours of\ncheesing and gossiping,\nthe tactics discussion\ntheir different brain func-tioning, the crews\u2019 eyes\nslowly began to close and\ncalled it a night.\nAt around 8am the following morning, everyone\npiled into cars and drove\nto Oxford, with an obligatory Maccies midway\nstop. Upon arriving at\nthe reservoir, the wind\nwas fairly light but nev-ertheless, racing started,\nand the day progressed\nwell, despite the cold and\ntorrential rain. Although\nevery race was lost that\nday, the team learned\nfrom the mistakes made\nand was not discouraged.\nThe initial plan for accommodation was to split\nthe team up in different\nOxford College floors.\nEveryone was quite disappointed by this cruel sep-aration, when a solution\narose: Toby\u2019s Grandpa\noffered up his lovely\nhome, only 20 minutes\nfrom the reservoir. This\nwas by far the most\ncomfortable of any event:\na warm bed each, comfy\nsofas, warm showers and\nmost of all\u2026 Maisie the\nadorable black Labrador\nthat was cuddled and\ncooed over all evening.\nBy 4pm everyone\nwas starving and made\nthe decision to ditch the\n9pm Curry social for a\ndelicious pub meal with\nToby\u2019s Grandpa.

According to\nHuawei\u2019s CEO, Richard\nYu, \u201cWe\u2019re entering a\nday and age where people\nexpect a holistic intelligent experience across\nall devices and scenarios.\nTo support this, we felt\nit was important to have\nan operating system with\nimproved cross-platform\ncapabilities.\u201d This operating system is expected\nto be rolled out in China\ntowards the end of this\nyear and internationally in\n2020.\nAlthough Huawei has\nestablished its capabilities and strong efforts in\nbuilding a custom operating system, it has yet\nto figure out how to build\na successful app store\nand convince developers\nto adapt their apps for\nHuawei Mate 30 Pro // Huawei\nISSUE 1735\nFELIX\nTECH technology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n33\nstate security only makes\nit more suspicious as to\nwhether the company\nactually accumulates intelligence for the Chinese\ngovernment.\nWith this suspicion as\na basis, the move towards\ncutting ties with Huawei\nhas been brewing for the\npastfewyears.InFebruary\n2018, FBI director Chris\nRay warned against\nbuying Huawei as well as\nZTE smartphones. A few\nmonths later, the Pentagon\nbanned the sale of those\nphones at US military\nbases, and towards the end\nof the year, Huawei\u2019s CFO\nwas arrested in Canada\nand charged with bank\nfraud. Further, telecom\nproviders in Australia\nstated that they wouldn\u2019t\nbe using any of Huawei\u2019s\ntelecom equipment in\ntheir 5G rollout plans and\nBritain\u2019s BT stated that\nthey would effectively\nremove all Huawei based\nequipment from their\ncurrent 4G setup by 2021.\nThese events did not play\nwell with the company\u2019s\nimage as whole.\nDuring the past week,\nthe Trump Administration\ngranted Huawei a 90-day\nextension from the ban.\nThis comes as a breather\nfor the forty or so small\nHuawei\u2019s platform. To do\nthis, Huawei announced a\n1billiondollarprogramme\nto encourage developers\nfrom around the world to\ncreate and support apps\nand games for its \u201cAppGallery\u201d. As consumers,\nwe know how critical an\napp marketplace is to the\nsmartphone experience.\nThus, the company hopes\nthat this programme\nwould help motivate\ndevelopers to consider\nits app distribution marketplace as important\nas those of Google and\nApple. Though, giving\nout money as an incentive\nto developers isn\u2019t enough\nto fix the company\u2019s\nimage as a whole. In all\nfairness, this new software\necosystem would lack the\nmiddle man that is Google\nin ensuring a moderate\nlevel of security. Thus,\nit\u2019s up to the consumer to\ntrust the company in its\nnew, distinct path towards\napproaching the tech\nmarket.\n\u201cAn app\nmarketpace is\ncritical to the\nsmartphone\nexperience\u201d\nFurthermore, Huawei\nreported that the blacklisting could potentially lead\nto the layoff of its 800+\nUS employees.

But I don\u2019t want\nto conflate this with our\nUnion\u2019s broader issues\naround staff retention.\nIt\u2019s not the same as losing\nsomeone who was here\nfor a shorter time. And\nthe reasons behind him\nleaving are very different\nto why most other staff\nleave.\nFelix: In terms of\npeople leaving, the\nUnion has also just\nseen the resignation of one of their\nmost senior student\nvolunteers in Thomas Cross, the CGCU\nPresident. What are\nyour thoughts about\nhis departure?\nAS: Tom is a very\noutspoken person, and\ncan be highly critical\nof the Union \u2013 but has\nalso been one of our\nmost committed student\nvolunteers. That he\u2019s felt\nthe need to resign at this\npoint is not good news\nfor any of us \u2013 for the\nUnion, or for the CGCU.\nMy understanding is that\nthis has come about as a\nresult of tensions within\nhis committee, which\nhe can talk about better\nthan me, and the high\nworkload on his course.\nWe all do tough degrees,\nand the Constituent Union\nPresident roles are among\nthe most time-consuming\nof the volunteer positions.\nIt\u2019s understandable that\nhe would want to put it\nto one side if he feels his\nwork is slipping. For our\npart, we want to ensure\nthe CGCU is supported\ngoing forward so they can\ndeliver their best effort to\nthe students of the Faculty\nof Engineering, and also\nthat any volunteer who\nhas experienced difficulties feels comfortable\napproaching us.\nFelix: Student rep-Abhijay Sood, the Union President // ICU\nresentation has come\nunder other scrutiny\nrecently after the\nrecent Union Council.\nHow come 60 of 61\nUnion policies were\nallowed to lapse?\nThe Union was left\nwith a single active\npolicy. How can this\nhave been allowed to\nhappen? Did this not\nresult in the Union\ntaking action without\nproper democratic\ninput, via policies\nestablished by Union\nCouncil?\nAS: I wouldn\u2019t say\nthat \u2013 there is democratic\naccountability built into,\nfor example, the OTs\u2019\nmanifestos. While that \u201860\nof 61\u2019 figure was true in\nterms of official policies\non the website, there have\nof course been meetings\nwith elected representatives in the last several\nyearsduringwhichstances\non various matters were\nestablished. The lapse in\npolicy specifically could\nbe due to administrative\nissues, staff turnover, a\nlack of urgency on behalf\nof previous student rep-resentatives, whatever\nit may be \u2013 but there are\nstill things we have agreed\nwithin the last three years\nsince some of those\npolicies lapsed.\nFelix: So if 60 of 61\npolicies can lapse\nand it makes no dif-ference, do they mat-ter? What\u2019s the point\nof them, are they at\nall important?\nAS: First of all, I think\nthe policies were ignored,\nand that was because there\nwere too many of them,\nand still are. Anything\nthe Union Council voted\non was put into policy \u2013\nsuch as a specific action\nto be taken by the Union\nPresident or Felix Editor \u2013\neven if they only applied\nover a short time frame.\nFelix: How are you\ndoing? Things heating up a bit, getting a\nbit stressful?\nAS: In terms of the\nstress \u2013 Unions have peaks\nand troughs. Welcome\nis a peak, then it calmed\ndown a bit, and now it has\nheated up a lot. With the\nupcoming departure of the\nManaging Director \u2013 the\nmost senior staff member\nin the Union \u2013 things are\ngoing to be difficult.\nFor reference, the\nManaging Director (cur-rently Jarlath) is the most\nsenior member of permanent staff in the Union.\nFelix: How does the\ndeparture of someone in that senior\nrole impact you and\nyour job?\nAS: There\u2019s a personal\nimpact whenever\nsomeone is leaving. Each\nof the Officer Trustees\n(OTs) work closely with\ndifferent members of\nsenior staff. Jarlath is the\none I work with most\nclosely personally \u2013 we\nshare an office in the\nUnion building. He\u2019s been\na soundboard for me, for\nexample, to test ideas, and\nwe\u2019ve worked on various\nprojects together. So in an\nofficial capacity there\u2019s\nalso a direct impact there.\nFelix: Jarlath is one\nof the most experienced staff members\nin the Union and the\nsecond most experienced member of the\nSenior Management\nGroup. What do you\nthink the impact of\nlosing his experience\nwill be?\nAS: A big reason we\nneed full time staff in the\nUnion is that students\naren\u2019t here all that long\n\u2013 OTs are only here for\na year, for example.

For the\nfirst time, I realised that\nmachine learning was not\nthe solution to all of my\nproblems\u201d\nLuckily the team was\nable to pull together in\nthis darkest of times.\nLuccas, the most moist\nmember of the team,\ntells us \u201cRafting with my\nmentors is dangerous,\nbecause I give them all\nmy trust. When things\ngo wrong, I have to pray\nand hope I will make it to\nLinear Algebra the next\nday\u201d. The crew rallied,\nput the raft on their heads\nand forged onwards.\nIt was at 8:45 as the\nsun began to come up\nthat the next disaster\nstruck. The team ran out\nof roasted corn, the one\nenergy source that they\nhad thought to bring with\nthem. \u201cThis is the sort of\nscenario for which you\ncan never prepare\u201d says\nLucas. Thankfully, the\nteam was comprised of\nhighly skilled individuals:\nNo\u00e9 had trekked 250km,\nself supported, in the\narctic ; Joao survived for\n10 days in wild Sicily;\nand Thomas asked a girl\nout once.\nAt long last the storied\nheights of Woodward\npeaked over the horizon,\nthe huge grey buildings\nrendering the explorers\ntemporarily speechless.\nHere for the first time\nwas tangible proof of\nWoodwards existence.\nThe fauna was eerie, the\ninstantly recognisable\nblended seamlessly with\nthe alien, herds of exotic\nart students wearing\nstrange bohemian clothes\nstrolled past solitary engineers wearing JP Morgan\n\u201cinsight day\u201d t-shirts.\nThe adventurers\napproached the building\ncautiously, unsure of\nthe response they would\nreceive from the guards\nat the Woodward gates.\nThey were pleasantly surprised to be welcomed in\nby admiring security staff.\nWhen asked an anonymous guard said \u201cThis has\nbeen one of the greatest\ndays of my career. I am\nused to dealing with\nfoolish drunk students but\nnever daring explorers\u201d\nWhen NegaFelix\nreached out for comment\nwe received this statement\n\u201cThis discovery comes as\na shock to us and we are\ncurrently investigating the\nsituation.

Here,\natmospheric synthesisers\nand industrial drums left\nplenty of space for Twig\u2019s\nvocals to croon, soar or\ncaress. Whilst being an\naesthetically satisfying\nrecord, one well worth a\nlisten for any electronic\nor art-pop fans, Barnett\u2019s\nsong writing often felt\nhollow and repetitive to\nthe point of redundancy,\ndampening the records\nlistenability.\nOn Magdalene Twig\u2019s\nlyricism is significantly\nmore rewarding, adding\na layer of emotional\nprecocity to her gorgeous\nsonic creations. Opener\n\u2018thousand eyes\u2019 sets the\nscene, embodying the\nterror of celebrity as a\nmany-eyed-beast, behind\na plodding, orchestral instrumental which splinters\nintermittently as if Twig\u2019s\ninsecurity corrupts the\nsong\u2019s file.\nThe centrepiece of the\nrecord is its title track.\nHere, Barnett explores\nthe expectations her\nlovers, and society have\nof her femininity, behind\na powerful hook and\nglitched, industrial production reminiscent of the\nLP\u2019s Cover.\nOn thematic twin \u2018holy\nterrain\u2019, Future (of all\npeople) steps into the fray\nto illustrate the fractious\nnature of modern mas-culinity. A feature which\nis thematically if not\nsonically satisfying.\nMuch of Magdalene\nfinds FKA Twig\u2019s eye\nturned upon the many\nfacets of a particularly\ncomplex relationship. The\nbeauty \u201cTaste the fruit of\nme/Make love to all you\nsee\u201d on \u2018sad day\u2019, the\nmistrust on \u2018fallen alien\u2019;\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what you\nwant \u2018cause I know you\nlie\u201d and the tragedy of no\nlonger having a partner\nto \u201cchase the pain away\u201d\nwith on \u2018mirrored heart\u2019.\nBarnett is an artist of few\nwords, but here the precision of her writing cuts\nthrough icy instrumentals\nto distil truth more poetic\nthan factual.\nPerhaps her best writing\ncan be found on Magdalene\u2019s penultimate tracks.\nOn closer \u2018Cellophane\u2019, a\nwonky piano progression\nbecomes the scaffold for\nvocal acrobatics, Twigs\ndelivering lines like\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I do it for you?/\nWhen all I do is for you\u201d,\nwhich splay rejection\u2019s\nbitter jaws wide.

The result is a\ncollection of fascinating\ninstrumentals, with well\nwritten chord progressions and a plethora of\ndetail rewarding repeated\nlistens.\nI didn\u2019t get tickets to\nsee Twigs live so i\u2019m\nsad, if you have a spare,\nor want to deliver some\nkiller journalism, drop a\nline to fmusic@ic.ac.uk.\nThe Old Blue Last hit by furious punk noise\nI\nhiked up to Shoreditch\nlast week to catch one\nof my favourite bands\nat the moment, Girls\nin Synthesis, as they played\none of the \u2018Fifty Fest\u2019 shows\nto promote the new music\non the bill for Brighton\u2019s\nThe Great Escape Festival.\nBefore GiS came The Cool\nGreenhouse, who offered\nup low-key Talking Headsesque tunes, complete with\nsynthy sounds. While the\nband played tightly together,\ntheir music seemed to need\nmaturing, but you could\neasily tell they were looking\nat the start of something\ngood, just needing a few\nmore years maturing before\nthat emerges. Having seen\nGiS once before I set the\nbar extremely high for what\nI expected - mainly furious\npolitical messages set to absolute uproar. GiS managed\nto blow all assumptions of\nwhat I was going to see out\nthe water. As their set started\nbassist John Linger asked to\nhave the lights off, plunging\nus into semi-darkness with\na spotlight throwing up\nLinger and guitarist Jim\nCubitt\u2019s shadows across the\nstage. They didn\u2019t stay there\nfor long though and soon\nwere both in the audience\naccompanied by their mics\nas drummer Nicole Pinto\nprovided a heavy beat to the\nchaos. \u2018Tainted\u2019, the band\u2019s\ntake on Trump, set off the\nband and crowd alike into a\nfrenzy, pumping pure angry\npunk energy through the\nroom, irresistible to ignore.\nIt was refreshing to see\na band not glued to their\nmics, or the stage even, and\nwho were very happy to\nrelinquish control of both in\na set that was victorious in\nassaulting as many senses\nas possible. Linger managed\nto fight back onto the stage\nin time for \u2018Howling\u2019, a\nfuzzy, swooning interlude\nin the set, before jumping\nback into their new song\n\u2018Arterial Movements\u2019. For\nGiS classics \u2018The Mound\nand \u2018We Might Not Make\nTomorrow\u2019, the audience\nswarmed over the band,\ncasting them aside from\ntheir mics and leaving them\nstruggling to play their own\nsongs. Overall it was explo-sive, abrasive, aggressive\nand any other \u2013ive adjectives\nyou can think of. After their\nset I stayed to recover before\nthe tube home, and managed\nto catch Do Nothing, a\nfunky, punky band hailing\nfrom Nottingham. Frontman\nChris Bailey seemed to take\nthe lead here, often distracting us from the actual music,\nwhich wasn\u2019t dissimilar\nagain from Talking Heads\nmixed this time with LCD\nSoundsystem. Bailey seemed\nto put on an act which came\nacross as a deadbeat, obnoxious salesman, certainly an\ninteresting stage persona for\nany band. Do Nothing\u2019s bops\nweren\u2019t terrible, but after the\nattack from GiS they just\ndidn\u2019t quite sound as good as\nthey should have.\nFKA Twigs is buffering // Wikimedia\nMUSIC\nFRIDAY, 22ND\nNOVEMBER, 2019 FELIX\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n26\nMUSIC\nEmily Freeman\nMusic Editor\nVenue: The Old Blue Last.\nDate: 14/11/2019.

The story\nfollows party girl Melanie\nDavis, the 60\u2019s more\nperceptive answer to Paris\nHilton, as she goes on a\nmission to deliver a pair\nof love birds for a man\nshe becomes enthralled\nwith. In order to get the\nbirds rightfully delivered,\nMelanie follows the man,\nMitchel Brenner, to the\nsleepy coastal town of\nBodega Bay, where it becomes clear that the birds\nare beginning to act eerily\nout of character.\nA notable characteristic\nfor the first half is the\npicture postcard ready\nshots thrown about, tying\nin with the mood of the\nscenes. With it being a full\nhour before the birds start\nshowing much violent be-haviour, Hitchcock spends\ntime effectively painting a\npicture of the tranquillity\nof the town and building\na cheeky rapport between\nour main protagonists.\nIf your appetite for\nhorror is only satiated\nby constant frights from\nthe get-go, The Birds is\nnot for you. However,\nthe \u2018scary scenes\u2019 in this\nfilm creeping in so slowly\nmeans the audience is able\nto soak up the hints of\nthings going awry before\nwe\u2019re confronted by them,\nleading to a more enjoyable payoff. When things\nfinally do start to go crazy,\nthe boundaries of reality\nare ripped open, with\nchildren being pinned to\nthe floor and dragged by\ntheir hair.\nThe Birds was nominated for its special effects\nsoon after its release, with\nfilm editors from MGM\nand Disney studios being\nemployed to utilise new\n\u2018yellow screen\u2019 technology to overlay some of\nthe masses of birds over\nthe cast. Even with this,\nI believe that if this film\nwas made today with\nmodern day CGI and\nrobotics, it wouldn\u2019t be\n\u201cHitchcock\nmakes\neveryday birds\nas menacing\nas any Freddie\nKruger or Mike\nMyers\u201d\nthe special effects that\nwould make it stand out,\nbut the sound technology.\nThis film hasn\u2019t got much\nof a soundtrack in the\ntraditional sense, rather\na carefully composed\nsymphony of birdsong\nthat, as the movie\nprogresses, trains the\naudience to fear it. This\nis particularly memorable\nwhen real trouble starts to\nbrew: it\u2019s a dusky evening\nand Melanie and Mitchell\nare having a dispute while\na crescendo of birdsong\nbegins. The audience\nrealises this first, then\nMelanie, and then we see\na sinister murder of crows\nperched on a nearby tree.\nYikes.\nA more unfortunate\nreoccurring motif in this\nfilm is that every single\nfemale character seems\npretty much useless at\ntrying to fight away these\nbirds. This ridiculousness\nreaches its apex when Mrs\nBrenner, Mitchell Brenner\u2019s mother, attempts\nto shoo away approximately 300 birds with a\nhandkerchief. Meanwhile\nit seems clear that it is\nonly the male characters\nintent on doing anything\nparticularly useful, such\nas nailing shut windows\nand doors and attempting\na plan to lure the birds\naway. It is worth considering that this may be an\nunfortunate by-product\nof looking back on a film\nfrom the 60s directed\n(obviously) by a man,\nwhen the writer of the text\nthis film is based on is in\nfact a woman. It is also\nworth mentioning that du\nMaurier disapproved of\nHitchcock diverging from\nthe story in some respects,\nfor example setting the\nfilm in west California\ninstead of Cornwall.\nAside from the characteristics that firmly root\nfilm where hundreds of\nbirds are caged in a bird\nshop, we see birds of all\nspecies working together\nagainst the common\nenemy: mankind. Much\nlike how the planet is\ncurrently fighting against\nus now with devastating\nforest fires and floods, the\naudience is warned against\nthe dangers of exploiting\nnature. Alternatively, a\nsimilar argument could be\nformed, with du Maurier\nportraying the birds as\nthose being exploited,\nwho, with their strength\nin numbers, can rise over\nthose oppressing them.\nWithout taking itself\ntoo seriously, The Birds\nmanages to show us that\nthere is a hint of horror in\nanything. Despite being\nreleased almost 60 years\nago, this story shows only\nsmall signs of aging. And\nagain, despite its age, it is\nan essential watch for any\nfan of horror and like it or\nnot, you\u2019re not going to\nappreciate birdsong for a\nwhile.\nHitchcock and one of his star crows // Sunset Boulevard/Corbis\nMelanie and a murder of crows looming overhead //Universal Pictures\nThe Birds as a film from\n1963, the themes of the\nmoviearetimeless.Itisnot\nlost on the town members\nthat this scenario is reality\nturned on its head, with\nit usually being humans\nculling any species that\nseems fit.

Goes the Future\u2026\nNatural innovations: New research shows how far the development of biomimetic sensors has come and the\npotential they have for mimicking real-life nervous systems\nSCIENCE\nChristine Parry\nScience Editor\n\u201cThe limiting\nfactor in\nadvancing\nrobotics to\nreflect human\nactions is not\nmechanical,\nbut that of\ndata-sensing\u201d\nH\nave you ever\nplayed with one\nof those snap\nw r i s t b a n d s\nwhen you were younger?\u201d\nAndresArrieta asks. In the\nEngineering lab at Purdue\nUniversity, Dr Arrieta and\nhis team have designed a\nnovel data sensor that uses\na similar snap-change;\nfrom a curved shape that\nis under tension, to a flat\nstructure which generates\nan electronic signal when\ntriggered. The latest in the\nfield of biomimetic sen-sors, this sensor has the\npotential to function like\na real-life nervous system.\nIn their flat form, the\nsensor\u2019s two layers are\nheld apart. Then, when\nan impact triggers a snap-change by a clever trick of\nengineering, the layers are\nbrought together, allowing\ntiny flecks of nickel that\nare spread throughout the\ntop layer to become close\nenough to conduct an\nelectrical signal.Amagnet\nin the bottom layer resets\nthe switch.\n\u201cThe shape is encoding\nthe message,\u201d says Dr\nArrieta. \u201cIt\u2019s just like\nhaving ones and zeros in\na binary system.\u201d And\nhe\u2019s right: the two shapes\ntranslate into a binary\n\u20181\u2019 and a \u20180\u2019, allowing\nthe sensor to generate a\nsimple string of data. Biomimetic developments\nlike these, taking inspiration from nature, have\nrevolutionised fields that\nrely on data-sensors such\nas automotive technology\nand robotics.\nThe advanced, yet\nmildly terrifying Cheetah\nrobot at the MIT Biomimetics lab uses similarly\nnovel biomimetic sensors\nin the Cheetah\u2019s footpads.\nThe limiting factor in advancing robotics to reflect\nhuman actions is not a\nmechanical problem, but\none of data-sensing. Data-sensors need to capture\na complex amount of data,\nprocess this in real-time,\nand yet be made of lasting,\ndurable materials.\nBiomimetic units like\nthese completely redesign\ndata-sensing. Current\ndigital models improve\nsensitivity by upping the\ndata input, relying on a\nsophisticated processing\nunit to sift through the\nvolumes of information.\nBut nature has already\nfound a more efficient\nanswer; filtering at the\npoint of data sensing,\ntriggering a signal only\nwhen past a set threshold.\nThis means Dr Arrieta\u2019s\nunit only snaps when it\nshould, and ignores the\nbackground noise. Yet, Dr\nArrieta explains, this still\ndoesn\u2019t explain the full\npotential of the research.\nCopying biology brings\nmore advantages than just\nefficiency; Mother Nature\nhas also worked out how\nto handle truly complex\ndata, including non-bina-ry data.\nDr Arrieta uses the\nexample of a bird\u2019s flight\nto explain this; nerves\nin the bird\u2019s wings are\nsensitive to the angle of\neach feather and how\nthey move in the wind as\nthe bird flies. The extent\nof change to this angle\ndetermines the action\nthe bird takes; a subtle\n\u2018wingtip\u2019 adjustment for\na light breeze, or a bigger\nmovement needed for a\nheavy gust. This unit, just\nlike a bird\u2019s wing, also has\nthe ability to generate a\nrange of actions.\n\u201cOur signals can be\ninterpreted in \u2018ones\u2019 and\n\u2018zeros\u2019, so \u2018on\u2019 and \u2018off\u2019.\nBut also - and this is really\nthe power of it - every\ntime there is a snap, there\nis a pulse of electricity.\nBinary logic has only a\n\u2018one\u2019 and a \u2018zero\u2019, but our\n[unit] works with pulses\nof information. So, depending on how fast, slow,\nstrong, or weak the sensor\nis triggered, the pulse\npattern will be different,\nand our unit interprets\nthese differences.\u201d\nThese unique electrical\npatternscanbemappedtoa\nlearning algorithm, which\ntranslates these signals\ninto various actions. This\nbrings the potential of\nthe system closer to a\nreal-life nervous system \u2013\ncompletely different from\ndigital data-sensing.\nSo, it\u2019s different - but is\nit really that much better\nthan digital methods?\nDaniel McKenna, a\nrobotics software engineer\nat the artificial intelligence start-up Emotech,\nthinks that both digital\nand biomimetic sensors\nhave their pros and cons.\nHe does, however, point\nout that while developers have now designed\nprocessors that can\nhandle huge amounts of\ndigitally generated data,\novercoming past limi-tations, there is a recent\n\u201cdrive to simplify things\u201d.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a push to try\nminiaturise things, move\nthem back onto devices\nwhile avoiding battery\ndrain, rather than relying\non the cloud servers that\nenable large amounts of\nprocessing power. These\nsensors would filter unnecessary information and\nlead to faster on-machine\nprocessing.\u201d.\nAsked to explain if\nDr Arrieta\u2019s excitement\nover the potential to\nread unique electrical\nsignals may be warranted,\nMcKenna points to his\nown analogy. Referring to\ndata like this as non-lin-ear, he describes water\nin a bucket responding\nto vibrations. The water\nconverts a time differentiated input (the beat of the\nvibrations) into a spatial\nsignal (the pattern of\nripples seen in the water),\nat a much quicker speed\nthan an algorithm could.\nLikewise, the electrical\npulse translates data at a\nmuch quicker speed than a\ndigital sensor would. \u201cThe\nprocessing that biomimetic sensors offer gives that\nelement of non-linearity\na lot easier than a digital\nsystem,\u201d he notes.\nBut before starting a\nwristband-wearing, mechanical cheetah-wielding\nrobotics revolution,\nMcKenna warns it will\nneed hours of testing\nbefore it goes to market\ndue to the high-stake\nsafety implications. But\ndespite a long road ahead,\nit\u2019s come a long way from\na simple snap-band toy.\nDon\u2019t you think?\nThe basic mechanism of the biomimetic sensor // https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.9b01095\n\u201cBiomimetic\ndevelopments\nhave revolutionised fields\nthat rely on\ndata sensors\nsuch as automotive technology and\nrobotics\u201d\n\n"

The recent\ncomments by Mr. Titmuss\nand Mr Liu on Felix have\ndrawn my attention to the\ndifferent opinions towards\nChina. It is apparent that\nboth of the authors only\nintended to have a dis-cussion; however, the last\nresponse by Mr. Titmuss\nwas seriously inappro-priate. Parts of Titmuss\u2019s\ncomment are not included\nas the \u201cproper operation of\nFreedom of Speech in the\nUK\u201d and some arguments\nwhich he made are lack of\nsupports.\nSome language in\nTitmuss\u2019s response should\nnot be rightfully used;\non the other hand, such\nexpressions in public\nmight have broken the\nlaws of UK. The Freedom\nof Speech only operates\nunder the premises where\nthe \u201creputation and rights\nof others\u201d are protected.\nAs Mr. Titmuss has\nadmitted to \u201cdeliberately\ninsult China\u201d in his\nsecond last paragraph,\nthe \u201cHuman Rights Act\n1998\u201d is not on his side.\nMoreover, it is doubtful if\nMr. Titmuss is guilty of an\noffence to use \u201cinsulting\nwords\u201d under section\nF3.4A of Public Order\nAct 1986. Some may say\nthat it is an exaggeration\nand Mr. Titmuss\u2019s use of\nlanguage only intends to\nmake his point; however,\nwhen \u201cChina\u201d becomes\nthe accusative after\n\u201cinsult\u201d, it is an abuse to\nmany Chinese nationals.\nCommenting and criticising constructively on the\ngovernment of a nation\nhelps it to improve yet it\nis unacceptable to insult\nan entire country. In this\nparticular case, it is even\nmore intolerable when\ninadequate examples are\nused in Mr. Titmuss\u2019s\ncommentary.\nBefore raising objections towards the Chinese\ngovernment\u2019s actions,\nit is necessary that the\nentirety of what had\nhappened which is not\nincluded in Mr. Titmuss\u2019s\nwriting. During the recent\nprotesting in Hong Kong,\nit is worth to note that it\nstarted out to be a peaceful\nprotest but the protestors\u2019\nbehaviours resemble\nterrorism to some extent\nas the conflict becomes\nmore and more violent.\nAlongside with the delays\nat the airport and fires set\nat subway stations, the\nriot is causing civilian\ncasualties. On Friday\n(Nov.15) morning, the\nFood and Environmental\nHygiene Department of\nHong Kong confirmed\nthe death of a 70-year-old\nworker who got hit by\nthe protestors at Sheung\nShui Station. A bit earlier\nin September, a visitor\nfrom mainland China\nwas beaten to severe\ninjury at the airport only\nbecause he did not agree\nwith the protestors. Such\nincidents are so prevalent\nin Hong Kong that they\ncan be easily found via a\nreputable and \u201coft-cited\u201d\nvenue, The Guardian. The\nprotestors are currently\nusing \u201cviolence and\nintimidation, especially\nagainst civilians, in the\npursuit of political aims\u201d\nwhich is exactly the definition of terrorism in the\nOxford Dictionary. The\ninstability in Hong Kong\nhas caused casualties in\nnot only civilians but\nmany more polices. For\ninstance, thirteen officers\nwere injured early in July\nwhen protesters threw unidentified liquids at them\nin a clash (CNN); a group\nof protestors beat a plainclothes policeman then\nthrew a Molotov cocktail\nthat briefly set the man\non fire (The Guardian).\nUnder section 89 of the\nPolice Act 1996, \u201cit is a\ncriminal offence to assault\na constable in the execution of his duty\u201d in the\nUK; such laws are similarly present in almost every\nnation on this planet. Not\nall the protestors are to be\nconsidered as terrorists\nwho attack civilians and\npolices, especially those\nwho pursue political aims\nthrough peaceful means;\nhowever, it is also vital\nto notice that many of the\nprotesters in Hong Kong\nare not in favour of peace.\nWith these facts in mind,\nit is easy to understand\nwhy the police in Hong\nKong have been arresting\nthe protestors and the\ngovernment of China has\nprohibited any support to\nprotesters online. If not,\nconsider how countries\nin the west dealt with\nterrorists and criminals\nwho committed assaults\non police officers. When\ntheir \u201cpursuit of freedom\u201d\nresults in the murder\nof innocent people and\nsevere damages to the\ncity, is it still \u201cglorious\u201d or\neven justified? When we,\nas spectators, irresponsibly shout out \u201cGlory to\nHong Kong\u201d, is it fair to\nthose Hong Kong citizens\nwho actually suffer from\nthis social unrest?\nPublications in a\nnewspaper must consider\nfacts but not subjective\nimpressions. Hong Kong\nis merely one of the\nexamples. For instance,\nachieving political aims\nis only part of the reasons\nfor creating the Great\nFirewall; some external\nonline platforms indirectly brought about terrorist\nactivities in China and\nmany websites contain\nnot politics-related but\nstill illegal materials.\nIn Mr Titmuss\u2019s logic\nof connecting the Great\nFirewall to highly oppressive censorship, it is likely\nthat many western nations\nalso have such censor-ships, especially after\nthe \u201cPRISM\u201d incident.\nAlso, before calling the\n1989 Tian\u2019anmen Square\nevent a \u201cmassacre\u201d, it is\nprobably better to know\nthe true history behind\nthe news. Based on\nstories from some of my\nfamily friends who are\nthe actual witnesses of\nthat event, I would not\ncall it a \u201cmassacre\u201d. My\nthree years of high school\nexperience in Canada\nhave provided me with\nmany different perspectives other than that of a\nChinese national; I have\nseen many kinds of arguments and discussions\nregarding Chinese politics\nand economy. All that I\ncould see from Mr Titmuss\u2019s response, though,\nis disrespect and provo-cation. What I expected\nfrom Felix was the spirit\nof seeking the truth and\nthe spread of constructive\nopinions.\nIn the future, it is important that writings on\nthe college newspaper are\nrespectful and rational. Mr\nTitmuss owes the readers\nof Felix an apology due\nto his inappropriate use\nof language and misleading dictions but it\nis still up to Mr Titmuss\nif such an apology will\nbe made. Felix provides\nImperial students with\nan excellent platform of\ninforming the rest of the\ncollege of their opinions\nand it is delightful that\npeople from various backgrounds could have their\nperspectives to collide;\nhowever, it is also worth\nto be mindful so that this\nplatform is not polluted by\nemotions or insults.\nCome sir, let us have a rational debate like gentlemen // Wikipedia\n\n"

Noise pollution can affect species\nby interfering with their\ncommunication, which\nis important for picking\na mate or warning for\npredator; this disruption\nmay lead to lower survival\nrates.\nFurthermore, noise\npollution may disturb the\nbalance of ecosystems, by\nchanging the dynamics\nbetween prey and pred-ators. For example, bats\nand owls rely on the\nsounds of the potential\nprey, and noise pollution\nmakes it more challenging\nto hear and find their prey,\nforcing them to invest\nmore time in sourcing\nfood, which could lead to\na decline in these species.\nIn the aquatic world,\nfish larvae find their\nhome based on the sound\nemittedbyreefs.Increased\nnoise pollution in the sea,\nmainly as a result of ships,\nmakes it more difficult for\nfish larvae to find suitable\nreefs, leading many to\nchoose less suitable reefs,\nwhich may reduce their\nlifespan.\nNoise pollution also\nhas a huge impact on\nthe natural migration of\nanimals. Many birds will\navoid noise polluted areas\nduring migration which in\nturn affects where birds\nchoose to live.

Indeed, all\norganisms studied, terrestrial and aquatic, were\nfound to be affected, indicating that noise pollution\naffecting animals is the\nnorm, not the exception.\nPrevious studies have\nsuggested that certain\nspecies are affected by\n\u201cNoise\npollution\nmust be\nconsidered as\na serious form\nof man-made\nenvironmental\nchange and\npollution\u201d\nnoise pollution, but this\nmeta-study is the first\nof its kind to provide\nquantitative evidence on\na widespread of species to\nencourage institutions to\nregulate noise pollution.\nThe study analysed the\neffects of noise in over\none hundred species,\nwhich were divided into\nseven groups: amphib-ians, arthropods, birds,\nfish, mammals, molluscs\nand reptiles.\nDr Hansjoerg Kunc,\nfrom the School of Biological Sciences at Queen\u2019s\nUniversity Belfast and\nlead author, concluded:\n\u201cThis large-scale quantitative study provides\nsignificant evidence that\nnoise pollution must be\nconsidered as a serious\nform of man-made environmental change and\npollution, illustrating how\nit affects so many aquatic\nand terrestrial species.\nNoise must be considered\nas a global pollutant and\nwe need to develop strategies to protect animals\nfrom noise for their livelihoods.\u201d The study has not\nevaluated the\nexact effects in terms of\nbeneficial and detrimental effects for different\nspecies, but it seems\nclear that noise pollution\ncan affect ecosystems in\ncomplex ways. Indeed, to\ncombat noise pollution,\nthere should be further\nresearch, and cooperation\nwith governments and\npolicy makers.

You\u2019re\nall wrong.\nPok\u00e9mon Sword and\nShield are amazing, the\nhate for it is, for the most\npart, unfounded, and\nhere\u2019s why.\nFirst of all, a quick dis-claimer: this is a review\nof Pok\u00e9mon Sword\nand Shield. I have fully\ncompleted Shield and am\nworking my way through\nSword (although the differences are minor). This\nis a spoiler free review\nbut if you want to play the\ngame knowing absolutely\nnothing about it, I would\nreturn to this review after\nthe fact.\nOn my 22-hour journey\nthrough the Galar region,\nI was constantly smiling\nfrom ear to ear at the\nbeautiful game that truly\nbrings Pok\u00e9mon into a\nnew generation. It was\na struggle to put down\nmy Switch when around\nevery corner was a new,\nbrilliantly designed,\nunique Pok\u00e9mon. I have\nplayed every mainline\ngame in the series and\nhaven\u2019t felt this sense of\njoy since Diamond and\nPearl. Every game in the\nseries makes changes, big\nand small, but never has a\ngame made me think \u201cthis\nis the new gold-standard\nof Pok\u00e9mon\u201d.\nThe Good\nThe first thing I noticed\nwhen I jumped into the\ngame was the sheer scope\nof the visuals. Many\npeople have hated on the\nlow-res texture (espe-cially the trees), which\nare there, but it is barely\nnoticeable when you\nare gazing over grassy,\nrolling fields or sneaking\nthrough mystical, glowing\nmazes in the forest.\nSword and Shield are a\nbreath of fresh air for the\nseries, introducing the\nfirst fully 3-D world with\na controllable camera in\nparts and aspects of free\nroam. Unfortunately,\nthe controllable camera\nis only available in the\n\u201cWild Area\u201d, a zone in the\ngame available before the\nfirst gym where you can\nexplore a massive area\nfull of various Pok\u00e9mon\nranging from level 10 to\n50+. It is a great addition\nto the typical formula\nwhere you can grind up\nas much as you want,\nmeaning you\u2019ll never hit\na roadblock throughout\nthe story. The best thing\nabout the wild area is the\nvariable weather. The wild\narea is split into separate\nzones that each can have\ntheir own unique weather\nranging from a sandstorm\nto snow, which affects the\nPok\u00e9mon you\u2019ll encoun-ter. This is great for fans\nof only a single type; I, for\none, love ice types, so the\nability to catch multiple\nice types in the early game\nis a wonderful opportunity\nI rarely get.\nFollowing the pattern\nof generation 6 and\n7, a brand-new battle\nmechanic has been added.\nDynamaxing (and its\nvery similar counterpart\n\u2018Gigantamaxing\u2019) is an\noption available during\nmajor battles in the game\nthat allows you to make\nyour Pok\u00e9mon grow to a\nmassive size, increasing\nits stats and changing its\nmoves to significantly\nmore powerful versions.\nGigantamaxing also does\nthis but changes the form\nof certain Pok\u00e9mon, such\nas Pikachu, that becomes\nan absolute chonk (rem-iniscent of the original\ndesign back in 1996).\nThis lasts 3 turns and\nadds a new dimension to\nbattling, as you have to\nmanage whether you are\ngoing to Dynamax early\non to get an advantage,\nor Dynamax at the same\ntime as your opponent\nto effectively neutralise\ntheir advantage from Dynamaxing. Dynamaxing\nalso features heavily in\nthe wild area, with certain\nspots throughout shooting\npillars of red light to the\nsky. You can go up to\nthese \u2018wells\u2019 and fight a\nDynamaxed Pok\u00e9mon\nwhich, if caught, will be\na great addition to your\nteam (as they generally\nhave much higher stats).\nLong term fans of the\nseries will be pleased\nto know that the new\nPok\u00e9mon are fantastic.\nThe unique designs bring\nback the philosophy of\nthe earliest games, with a\nhuge variety of creatures,\nany of which you\u2019d love\nto have as a pet in real\nlife! (No key rings or\nliteral piles of trash this\ntime). Gamefreak, the developer of Pok\u00e9mon, has\ndone a great job this time\nround of not revealing too\nmuch before the game\u2019s\nrelease. I was surprised\nby new Pok\u00e9mon around\nevery corner, including\nGalarian forms that not\nonly put a new spin on\nprevious \u2018mons, but also\ngive some of them brand-new evolutions, such as\nObstagoon \u2013 the tantalis-ingly terrifying evolution\nto Galarian Linoone. With\nSword and Shield keeping\nthe trend of no HMs in\nthe game, you are free to\nbuild your team however\nyou like \u2013 a task that is\nextremely difficult with\nnearly 100 new \u2018mons and\nhundreds more returning.\nAfter the omnisham-bles that was Alola, we\nfinally see the return of\ngyms! And what a return\nto form. The puzzles\nbefore the main fight are\noriginal and the fights\nthemselves are breath-tak-ing. The Galar region is\nheavily inspired by the\nU.K. and in true British\nform the gyms are effectively football stadiums.\nSeeing the roaring crowd\ncheer me on as I, fully\nkitted out in sports gear,\nmake the finishing blow\nfrom across the field was\na whole new level of\nimmersion I have never\nexperienced in a Pok\u00e9mon\ngame before. Not only the\nPok\u00e9mon, but the gym\nleaders too have amazing\ndesigns \u2013 each character\nemanates the love for their\nspecialised type without\nsaying a word.\nMusic\nOne of my favourite\naspects of Sword and\nShield is the music and\nart. Each town has its own\ntune \u2013 both new songs\nfeature as well as remixes\nof older ones that hit that\nnostalgia nail right on the\nhead while still keeping\nthe general theme of the\ngame intact. The art in\nthe games is beautiful.\nBeing based off the U.K.,\nthere are many areas\nwhich reference different\ncities and areas within the\nU.K. Grand castles, clock\ntowers, charming little\nhamlets, and farm towns\ngive the world a huge\nvariety of scenery whilst\nstill keeping under a\nunified theme which in the\npast has not been executed\nas well. (I\u2019m looking at\nyou Alola, you can\u2019t just\nput 4 islands next to each\nother and call it Hawaii).\nThe\u2018Bad\u2019\nThis section is three-fold. I will cover what\nactually missed the mark\nin this game but also cover\nwhat people, who haven\u2019t\neven played the game,\nthink is bad and give my\ntwo cents on why they\naren\u2019t as big of an issue as\nyou may think.\nThe three starters from left to right: Grookey, Scorbunny and Sobble.

    "content": "The \u2018Earthling\u2019 Ed Winters: Chuka Nwobodo Argues\nfor Veganism\nO\nn October 29th\n,\nThe Speakers\u2019\nSociety hosted\n\u2018Earthling\u2019 Ed\nWinters as he weighed\nthe pros and cons of a\nvegan lifestyle and tried\nto persuade an audience\nto think more deeply as to\nwhether we can morally\nexploit animals for food,\nmedicine, and so on.\nThe statistics concerning animal agriculture\nare startling. A third of\nall the available land\non Earth is cleared to\nmake way for billions of\nlivestock waiting to be\nslaughtered. Over 100\nspecies are lost each day,\nand we are eliminating\nspecies 1000 times faster\nthan is natural, according\nto Christine Dell\u2019Amore\nof National Geographic.\nMany people seem to\nthink that transportation\nis the most significant\ncontributor to greenhouse emissions. They\nare mistaken! Animal\nagriculture beats them all,\naccording to the Food and\nAgriculture Organisation\nand the United Nations.\nMoreover, up to a third of\nall usable water on Earth\nis reserved for livestock.\nIronically, a convention\nbetween the Millennium\nEcosystem Assessment,\nthe IUCN Red List, and\nthe Global Environmental\nand Biodiversity Outlook\ndemonstrated that up to\n90% of freshwater pollution is caused by animal\nagriculture.\nEven still, perhaps you\nthink this doesn\u2019t really\naffect you. Maybe you\npurchase meat that is\nsupposedly \u2018ethical and\nsustainable\u2019.\n\u201cMy meat is organic,\ngrass-fed, and raised by\nBritish farmers,\u201d you\nmight say. First and\nforemost,Edchallengesus\nto consider what actually\nis organic. Often, farmers\nbend the rules to optimise\ntheir sales. This means\nthat they can still pack\nchickens into small barns\nby the thousands and be\nlabelled as free-range or\norganic. Additionally, you\nmay argue that grass-fed\ncows are more \u2018humanely\u2019\nexploited than corn-fed\nsince grass is closer to\ntheir natural diet than\ncorn. Ed informs us they\nwill still eventually be\ninjected with major doses\nof antibiotics until they\nare economically viable\n\u2013 which, I believe, is not\nhumane. As Ed asks: is\nthere any relevance in\nmaking livestock\u2019s lives\n\u2018freer\u2019 if we are just going\nto forcibly take their lives\nfrom them in the end\nanyway? I don\u2019t think\nanyone could relate to that\nkind of \u2018freedom\u2019. Finally,\nwhile \u2018homegrown\u2019 livestock may taste better to us\nand be better for the envi-ronment, when the result\nis an increase in demand\nfor local produce, does it\nreally make a difference?\nWe need to recognise that\n\u2018organic\u2019, \u2018grass-fed\u2019, and\n\u2018homegrown\u2019 may well be\nmarketing terms vying to\nmislead us and to make\nus feel comfortable with\nseriously injuring our\nenvironment.\nBy now, you may argue\nthat while using animals\ninstead of more sustainable alternatives for food\nmay be unjust, what about\nwhen they help to save\nlives? They have helped\nhumanity enormously,\nafter all. Just look at the\ntrend in life expectancy\nover the years! Animal\nresearch has contributed\nto over 70% of Nobel\nPrizes in Physiology and\nMedicine.\nI believe medicine is\nbased on old-fashioned\ntechniques. We still\nperform live demonstrations of dissecting frogs\nto explain the function of\nthe liver, when YouTube\nvideos would, in most\ncases, suffice. This is just\none example of where a\npedagogical shift should\nbe made to minimise\nsuffering.\nWho is to say that the\nsame could not be done\nfor clinical trials? Clearly,\nthe fixation on clinical\ntesting needs to be chal-lenged. Is there any way\nto map the responses an\norganism will have to a\ndrug without the need to\nsacrifice lives to do so?\nI don\u2019t know of anyone\nwho knows the answer to\nthis. The existing methods\nare effective, despite their\nethicaldubiousness,andso\nfew people bother to seek\nalternatives. Ed claims\nthat a vegan lifestyle can\nchange the mindset. I can\nonly imagine what could\nhappen - what advancements could be made in\nthis area - if the medical\ncommunity became\nvegan.\nWhere do you, the\nreader, stand in all of\nthis? A vegan lifestyle\nis both environmentally\nsustainable and naturally\nmedicinal. In other\nwords, if we all became\nvegan, Ed argues that\nthere would be enough\nresources available to\nsolve world hunger, and\nwe could save millions of\nendangered species and\ntheir habitats. Plus, we\nwould never even contract\nmany of the diseases we\nwould normally treat with\nanimal-tested drugs.\nSupport the revolution.\nSupport veganism!\nEd (https://earthlinged.\norg/) is an acclaimed\nBritish activist who has\npreached to the masses\nand debated against\ndie-hard Ivy League\nstudents on becoming\nvegan. His company,\nSurge, is starting a revolution and has already\nrecently upscaled its res-taurant, Unity Diner. He\nhas given two TEDx talks\nwith over half a million\nviews. He has presented\na stunning documentary,\nLand of Hope and Glory\n(https://www.landofhope-andglory.org/). He\u2019s also\nbig on social media with\nover 200,000 subscribers\non YouTube.\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, NOVEMBER 22ND\n, 2019\nC&S felix@imperial.ac.uk\n38\nEd Winters in 2018 // Wikimedia\nVeganism has many arguments for and against - here, the Speakers\u2019 Society VP (Events) talks about Ed Winters\u2019\nand his own arguments for joining the vegan revolution\nC&S\nChuka Nwobodo\nSpeakers\u2019Society VP\n(Events)\n\n"

It puts some\nstudents off of even\napplying to certain jobs\nin certain industries, and\nit can oftentimes deflect\nfrom academic studies.\nThat was a problem that\nwe wanted to see to.\nFelix: A lot of people\nwould look at this as\nshifting power away\nfrom the employer\nand towards the\njobseeker in terms\nof time commitment\nand expectation. Was\nthat something you\nfeel was deliberately there during the\nprocess?\nLuana: Personally for\nme, it\u2019s about students\nhaving an opportunity\nto be in contact with\ncompanies they wouldn\u2019t\nusually be in contact with\nor know about \u2013 more\nniche or boutique companies in a certain industry,\nwhich may not have the\nlarge brand presence that\nall students would know\nabout.\nAhana: To start with,\nwe had big companies\nsign up to use the service\n\u2013 Morgan Stanley, UBS,\nand others. These are\nplaces that have enough\napplicants; they don\u2019t\nexperience this issue. But\nthey wanted to use the\nservice to supplement\nwhat they already have\nwith their graduate recruitment teams.\nThe real gap in the\nmarket that we are trying\nto fill is for smaller to\nmedium sized companies\n\u2013 top students from top\nunis are only applying\nto big companies (say,\nGoldman Sachs), which\nonly have a limited\nnumber of positions and\nfor which there is fierce\ncompetition. But there are\na lot of other companies\nwhichalsoofferequivalent\nsalaries, experiences, and\nopportunities, but which\nstudents don\u2019t know about\nand which don\u2019t have\nthe same infrastructure\nand manpower to have a\nstrong presence on university campuses. So part\nof my job as part of client\nacquisition is to identify\nthese very high-quality,\nsmaller-to-medium size\ncompanies and match\nthem with students that\nthey ordinarily might not\nhave managed to reach\nout to, and so to allow\nstudents to get a great job\nthey might otherwise have\nmissed out on.\nFelix: On the site,\nyou talk about some\nset of parameters\nby which you assess\ncompanies for inclusion \u2013 can you talk\nabout those?\nAhana: At the moment,\nwe\u2019re a student startup so\nit is somewhat up to our\ndiscretion and personal\nexperience, but we\u2019ve\ntried to construct our team\nout of people who have\nhad some sort of industry\nexperience \u2013 like people\nwho have good connections in the industry, or\nhave a good commercial\nsense of it \u2013 in a variety\nof sectors, so that choice\nis honed by expertise. The\nbasic criteria we look for\ninclude things like general\nreputation. We then also\nutilise other rankings,\nsuch as the TARGETjobs\ntop 300 employers \u2013 we\ncan leave a lot of the \u2018dirty\nwork\u2019to the professionals,\nfor now, and use those\navailable resources.\nFelix: Are you looking to incorporate\nthings like anecdotal\nexperiences from\nstudents who have\ntaken placements at\na company?\nAhana: Absolutely.\nHowever, we are not yet\nquite at the scale, and have\nnot quite been around long\nenough, to see students\nthrough the entire process\nof being hired and undergoing internships and\nsuch. Most clients we\u2019re\nin discussions with will\npredominantly begin\nusing VCH for next year\u2019s\nrecruitment cycle.\nWe do always encourage feedback on all sides.\nOn the client acquisition\nside, I\u2019m always asking\ncompanies how we can\nimprove and better service\ntheir needs. On the student\nside, we have a really\nstrong team of people\nacross all the universities\nwho work directly with\nthe students being hired.\nWe also want companies\nto be giving feedback\non the students \u2013 which\nthey can then use on their\nprofile to strengthen it, if\nthey so desire.\nLuana: The structure\nwe have for that is inter-esting. We\u2019re currently\nlooking to expand our\nnetwork, at Imperial espe-cially, but also at Durham,\nLSE, UCL, and Oxbridge.\nWe\u2019d like a lot more\nstudents to join, but also\nstudent advisors. Each\nstudent advisor would\nreport to me. Their role\nwould be to help obtain\nthings like society partnerships \u2013 such that societies\nand their members could\nbenefit from connecting\nwith us, such as from\nnetworking events and\ninformation. My plan at\nImperial is that when we\npartner with societies we\nwould ask one of their\ncommittee members to\nbe the student advisor for\nthat society, and would\nrun that section of the\nVCH for their society.\nAs a student advisor,\nyou\u2019d also liaise with the\ncompanies to talk about\nhow to best provide for\nthe students who want to\nundertake their intern-ships.\nFelix: On the student\nside \u2013 you\u2019re specifically so far looking at\na specific set of very\nelite universities,\nmostly in a particular\ngeographic region.\nWhy those universi-ties?\nAhana: That\u2019s just\nhow we\u2019ve started \u2013 we\ndefinitely have plans to\ncontinue to expand, and\nare currently in the process\nof expanding to Warwick.\nWe certainly aim to bring\nmore universities on\nboard, as we think it will\nhelp everyone.\nBut we\u2019re setting it up\nso that there are enough\npeople on the team at\neach university to provide\nproper support to ensure\nthe project thrives \u2013 which\ninvolves a lot of time\ncommitment. The long-term plans are to not only\nexpand to the rest of the\nUK, but also to Europe in\nthe next two years and \u2013 if\nall goes well \u2013 to the US\nwithin the next five.\nAhana: For the time\nbeing, considering where\nwe are at, VCH would be\nRussell-Group-oriented.\nThe nature of the jobs and\ncompanies we are working\nwith at the moment\nspecifically headhunt for\ntop students. If we help\neven some students get a\ngood job, then we have\nsucceeded in our goal.\nFelix: Funding-wise,\ndoes all funding\ncome from companies that pay to use\nthe service, and is it\nfree for students?\nAhana: Yep, absolutely.\nWe would never want to\ncharge students to use\nthe service \u2013 that would\ncompletely go against\nwhat we are trying to do!\nWe charge companies\nbased on their size and\nbased on how much they\nuse the database. It also\nvaries from sector to\nsector \u2013 some companies\nhave specific recruitment\ntimes, such as summer\ninternships, with only a\nshort recruitment cycle, so\nwe plan around that.\nFelix: What about the\nexperience of being\npart of VCH?\nLuana:Intermsofbeing\na student advisor, there are\na lot of networking events\nto be involved with, lots\nof free merch, and so on.\nWe want to make VCH a\nsociety at Imperial, for the\nstudent advisors, where\nwe can meet and discuss\nour goals and actions.\nWe\u2019ll run pub nights and\nthings as well \u2013 we want\nto build up the network\norganically and socially.\nAhana: That applies to\nall aspects of the business.\nIf you\u2019re someone who is\nwell-connected and wants\nto work on the client side\nand get exposure to some\ngreat companies, there\nare opportunities within\nthe team. The tech we\u2019re\nusing is also our primary\nfocus right now, so there\nare plenty of opportunities\nfor student developers\nto get involved too. As\nLuana said, on the student\nside, the marketing and\nthe fun events \u2013 there\u2019s\na lot of opportunities for\npeople who want to be\ninvolved.\nFelix: Are you liaising with the College\nabout this at all, such\nas the Careers Service, or is this entirely\nindependent?\nLuana: We did get in\ntouch with the Careers\nService, but they weren\u2019t\ninterested! They offered\nus a stall at their Careers\nFair, but a stall is very\nexpensive so we couldn\u2019t\ntake advantage of that.\nHowever, the Physics\nCareers Group has sent\nout emails to physics\nstudents and such. Mostly,\nno \u2013 this is student-led.\nHowever, we\u2019d be keen to\nwork with any department\nto help their students get\naccess to the best possible\njobs and internships.\nISSUE 1735\nFELIX\nC&S felix@imperial.ac.uk\n37\nAhana and Luana, Imperial VCH team // Luana Williams\n\n"

They can also vary\naccording to the region of\ninvestment (usually split\nbetween well-established\neconomies and emerging\nmarkets). It is also very\ncommon to mix various\nassets together and thus\nform hybrid funds (which\nare formed based on the\nlevel of risk that investors\nare willing to take).\nAlongside with\n\u201ctypical\u201d investment\nmanagers, there are\nseveral special types that\nwe look into below.\nFirst of all, are the\nwell-recognised hedge\nfunds. Hedge funds are\na special type of asset\nmanagement firm that\nuse high-risk investment\nstrategies for obtaining\nthe largely above-average\nreturns. Unlike other asset\nmanagement firms, they\nare much less regulated,\nand thus could employ\nthe strategies unavailable\nfor other organisations. At\nthe same time, due to high\n\u201cA special\nform of private\nequity \u2013\nventure\ncapital firms\ninvest in\nearly stage\ncompanies...\u201d\nrisk associated with their\nactivities, hedge funds are\nnot allowed to advertise\nthemselves and are only\nopened for accredited\ninvestors.\nAnother type of alternative investment managers\nare private equity firms.\nThey earn their profits\nby buying shares within\nprivately-owned compa-nies. A special form of\nprivate equity \u2013 venture\ncapital firms invest in\nearly stage companies and\nassist them with the initial\ndevelopment.\nOverall, working in\nthe asset management\nindustry is definitely a\nchallenging, yet very rewarding experience, and\nit\u2019s definitely worth considering it as an option on\nany stage of one\u2019s career.\nDisclosure: The author\nof this article is not attributed to any of the asset\nmanagement firms listed\nabove and is not planning\nto invest into them in the\nnext 48 hours.\n*Not to be confused\nwith custodian services,\nwhich are responsible for\nmanaging (i.e. holding)\nthe assets on behalf of\ntheir clients.\n**The exact de\ufb01nition\nmay vary, but the minimum\namount required for using\nthe wealth management\nservices is usually at least\n1,000,000 dollars.\nFig 3.

    "content": "ISSUE 1735\nFELIX\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n29\nEighth Generation Feels as Fresh as the First\n\u201cGrand castles,\nclock towers,\ncharming little\nhamlets, and\nfarm towns\ngive the world\na huge variety\nof scenery.\u201d\n\u201cIt took me\n22 hours to\nbeat the game\nbut 6 hours to\neven get to the\nfirst gym but\ngranted I like\nto take things\nslow...\u201d\nLet\u2019s start by covering\nthe big controversy\nsurrounding the game in\nrecent months. Internet\ndubbed \u2018Dexit\u2019, referring\nto the fact that Sword and\nShield does not contain\na national dex (meaning\nthis game does not contain\nevery Pok\u00e9mon ever,\neven if you transfer them\nfrom past games), has\ninfuriated many people.\nThis is understandable at\nthe surface level. Every\nPok\u00e9mon out there is\nsomeone\u2019s favourite, so\nyou are bound to be upset\nby this if you love Bidoof\nand find out he\u2019s nowhere\nto be found (sorry to the\none person out there that\nlikes them). However,\nI would argue this is a\ngood thing for 2 reasons.\nFirstly, it means people\nget to branch out. If you\ntypically catch the same\nPok\u00e9mon every game\nand have the same tactics\nevery time, this change\ncauses you to think differently and who knows,\nyou might even find a\nnew favourite Pok\u00e9mon\nthat you would never\nhave even considered\nusing. Secondly, and more\nimportantly to those who\ntypically catch EVERY\nthroughout the years as\nthe meta game constantly\nshifts every year. This\nwill keep the competition\nmuch more interesting\nas it will require players\nnot only to have a deep\nknowledge of the core\nmechanics of Pok\u00e9mon,\nbut also require players to\nbe versatile and have the\nability to adapt to changes\nimplemented in each iteration of the game. Finally,\nmost people don\u2019t catch\nall the Pok\u00e9mon anyway\nso most of the people\ncomplaining are doing so\nfor no honest reason\u2026\nfrom my experience most\nof the people complaining wouldn\u2019t have even\nplayed the game anyway!\nAnother issue some\nhave, that I have already\ncovered, is the use of\nlow-quality textures and\nthe re-use of old assets\nin animation. Now while\nthis is annoying in some\naspects, I generally found\nthat I was too busy staring\ninto the distance at a\nbeautiful landscape or\ncity to notice a blade of\ngrass being a bit fuzzy.\nEqually the animation\nquality is not noticeable\nbecause at the end of the\nday it\u2019s not possible to\ncreate unique animations\nfor every Pok\u00e9mon in the\ngame using every move.\nWith the art style being\nso refined and clean now\nafter years of iteration, I\nthink the actual graphical\nfidelity is not something\nthat should be a focus,\nespecially not from a\nNintendo game which has\nnever been renowned for\nbeing a market leader in\nresolution and detail alone\n(or at least not since the\nN64). I will say however\nthat improving these\nissues in the future would\nbe a welcome change, I\njust don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to be outraged by\nsomething which makes\nlittle difference to the\noverall experience of a\nbeloved RPG franchise.\nReal Issue\nMy main issue with\nthe game, however, is\nin its story and pacing.\nGenerally, main series\ngames have a great story,\nlinking in with an evil\nteam and the legendries of\nthe region, no spoilers but\nthis is not really covered\nas well as previously\nwith Team Yell, the \u2018evil\u2019\nteam of gen 8 being little\nmore than an occasional\nnuisance throughout the\ngame was disappointing,\nespecially given the lack\nof any true \u2018dungeon\u2019 to\nbe found. Equally, I found\nthe pacing to be quite\nuneven. It took me 22\nhours to beat the game but\n6 hours to even get to the\nfirst gym. Granted I like to\ntake things slow, but it\u2019s a\nbit ridiculous that this is\nthe case \u2013 especially when\nyou are limited to catching\nPok\u00e9mon up to level 20\nuntil you beat the first\ngym. Luckily after that\nthe pace picks up a bit, but\nalmost too fast such that\nthe story takes back seat\nand your only sense of\nprogression is how far you\ncan make it through the\nwild area. This, coupled\nwith a disappointing lack\nof post-game content was\nan unfortunate smudge\non an otherwise gem of a\ngame.\nVerdict\nPok\u00e9mon Sword and\nPok\u00e9mon Shield blew me\naway and exceeded my\nexpectations to the fullest.\nDespite a somewhat\nawkward pacing, the\nchild-like feeling of\nanticipation around every\ncorner and the awe-in-spiring view into the\nmesmerising Galar region\nis one that will not be forgotten any time soon. For\npeople put off by previous\ngenerations, I highly recommend checking it out;\nfor any long-term fan of\nPok\u00e9mon, you will not be\ndisappointed. This game\nis Pok\u00e9mon to its core and\nI loved every minute of it.\nIf you disagree, feel free\nto email games.felix@\nimperial.ac.uk. We love\nhearing you feed back and\nare always looking for\nnew team member!\nAs always the logos hint at the look of the legendaries of each game. The classic Red vs Blue returns//Pokemon GO Hub\nPok\u00e9mon, the competitive scene will benefit\nmassively. Each game\nfrom now on will have a\nmeta defined by which\nPok\u00e9mon are available,\nmeaningthat you will see a\ndiverse array of strategies\n\n"

A\nwell-known example of\nthis is CW\u2019s \u201cThe Flash\u201d,\nwhere satellites, communication systems, data\ncentres, power grids, and\nsecurity equipment are\nhacked into on a regular\nbasis. Another example,\nwell known in the gaming\ncommunity, is Watchdogs,\na game where you can\ntrigger explosives, control\ntraffic lights, hack bank\naccounts and personal\ninformation, and even\njam cellphone networks\nall through a few taps on\na smartphone. This may\nseem thrilling, dramatic,\nor even \u2018awesome\u2019 at\ntimes in context of the\nseries, video game, or\nmovie, but it is, in actuali-ty, a very serious concern.\nWith data being the\nworld\u2019s most valuable\nresource, it\u2019s no surprise\nthat there has been a huge\nsurge in the number of\ncyber attacks all around\nthe world over the past\ndecade. Even the new\nDisney+ service, which\nThese examples show\nhow even the biggest of\ncompanies are susceptible\nto malicious attacks and\nwhy cyber security plays\na critical role as we head\ninto the future.\nIn the past year, you\nmight have noticed a lot\nof companies place an\nincreased emphasis on\nthe privacy and security\nof their users\u2019 personal\ndata. From Apple introducing its secure \u201cSign\nin with Apple\u201d feature\nto Facebook announcing\n\u201cThe Future is Private\u201d at\nits annual F8 conference\nin May, it\u2019s clear that\ncompanies are, in some\nways, trying (and often\nfailing) to protect their\nusers\u2019 data from theft.\nOftentimes, companies\nthemselves exploit the\npersonal data of their\nuser base to \u2018improve\u2019\nthe customer experience.\nA more recent example\nof this is Amazon\u2019s admittance of using human\nstaff to analyse and\ngrade short recordings\nof users\u2019 interaction with\nAlexa, Amazon\u2019s virtual\nassistant. These human\ngenerated reports are used\nto improve the speech\nrecognition and natural\nlanguage processing\ncapabilities of Alexa as a\nplatform. Amazon claims\nthat the recordings cannot\nbe traced back to the user\nand that there are strict\nmeasures in place to\nsafeguard privacy, but it\u2019s\nstill eerie and unsettling\nto know deep down that\nsomeone somewhere is\nlistening in on you.\nOn a much larger scale,\nmore than people, governments possess highly\nsensitive, classified information and have to ensure\nthat their facilities follow\nstrict security protocols to\navoid being tapped into\nby the wrong people. This\nbrings cyber-warfare, or\nlarge scale digital attacks\nbetween different nations,\ninto the story. With countries around the world\naccumulating a massive\namount of intelligence\non each other, it\u2019s only\na matter of time before\none of them uses it for\neconomic benefit through\nmeans of hacking or\nblackmail.\nIn addition, if these\nattacks are used to disrupt\nmilitary activities or to\naccumulate strategic information on a country\u2019s\nassets or plans, then it\ncould prove fatal when\nused in physical warfare.\nThus, to protect civilians\nand to ensure peace,\ngovernments around\nthe world have taken\nseveral cautious security\nmeasures to safeguard\ntheir confidential infor-mation.\nOne such measure was\nU.S. President Donald J.\nTrump\u2019s move to ban U.S.\nbased companies from\nworking with Huawei\nthrough a national\nsecurity order. Huawei,\nthe Chinese telecom giant\nand one of the world\u2019s\nlargest smartphone\nmanufacturers took a\nhefty blow following the\norder as it was cut-off\nfrom Google\u2019s android\nplatform and services\necosystem. This, in fact,\nmeant that Huawei was\ncut at its knees just when it\nreached the top of the tech\nmarket. In effect, the tech\ncommunity seemed as if\nit lost a valuable player in\nthe smartphone space.\nHuawei caters to all\nthree groups of the smartphone market: high-end or\nflagship, mid-range, and\nbudget (through its sub-brand Honor). Without\nfurther major software\nupdates from Google, this\nban effectively affects\nconsumers in all three\ncategories. However, the\nUS government has eased\nrestrictions, so US-based\nbusinesses are allowed to\ncontinue their operations\nwith Huawei to abate the\ndisruption on consumers\nusing Huawei\u2019s widely\ndistributed products.\nSo, where did this all\nstart? Well, with Facebook\ngranting it special access\nto user data and Vodafone\nfinding hidden backdoors\nin its telecom equipment,\nHuawei has been controversial figure with regards\nto its security and privacy\nmeasures. In addition, the\nCIA\u2019s claim that Huawei\nis funded by Chinese\n\u201cData is the\nworld\u2019s most\nvaluable\nresource\u201d\nlaunched under a week\nago, saw its user base\nhacked within a few days\nof launch. Furthermore,\nin 2011, Sony\u2019s playstation network was hacked,\nand the personal data (in-cluding credit card infor-mation) of more than 77\nmillion users was leaked.\nThis cost Sony more than\n15 million dollars in compensation and legal fees.\nTechnology Being Used To Spy On People // Matthew Henry - Unsplash\nCyber Warfare Operators // US Department of Defense\n\n"

With the\nRemain Alliance instigated between the Lib Dems,\nGreens and Plaid Cymru\nand the Brexit party\nmaking its own unilateral\nalliance, some voters find\nthemselves abandoned.\nAs with everything\nnowadays, Brexit plays a\nhuge part in this election.\nOn the remain side, three\nparties, the Green\u2019s, Lib\nDems and Plaid Cymru\nhave formed a remain\nalliance in over 60 seats\nacross the UK. In practice,\nthis means that in each\nseat, they are all throwing\ntheir weight behind the\nparty with the best chance\nto win in a bid to get\nstrong remain candidates\ninto Parliament.\nThis may seem noble to\nsome: politicians putting\naside their ambitions and\nviews for the greater good\nof a Britain in Europe,.\nHowever Brexit is just\nthe tip of the iceberg of\npolitical issues facing the\nBritish public. An election\nis not a referendum and\nuniting behind a single\nissue such as Brexit leaves\nvoters who also care about\nother issues lost.\nBut isn\u2019t Brexit all that\nmatters? Isn\u2019t Brexit the\nissue that will define our\nlives forever? The jury is\nstill out but no issue is big\nenough to compromise all\nyour values for. This may\nseem a bit dramatic but let\nme paint a picture.\nImagine you are a\nGreen voter, passionate\nabout the environment\nand excited about strong\nsocialist policies. Under\nthis alliance, you are now\ninexplicably being pushed\nto vote for the Lib Dems\nand Jo Swinson. The\nsame Lib Dems who were\nin bed with an austerity\naddicted Tory monster.\nThe same party who supported the bedroom tax,\nbenefit cuts and universal\ncredit. The real kick in the\nface is the Lib Dems environmental record: voting\nto sell forests, encourage\nfracking and reduce subsidies for renewable energy.\nIn over 40 seats, the\nGreens have vanished\ninto thin air, leaving the\nTory-lite Lib Dems with\na rather abhorrent policy\nrecord in charge. Clearly,\nthe Greta Thunberg\u2019s of\nBritain will definitely not\nbe voting Lib Dem on\nDecember12th.Manywill\nprobably vote Labour. But\nis all this political reshuffling worth it for a couple\nof percentage points\nmore towards a remain\ncandidate who already has\nlittle chance of winning\nfor a party which has even\nless chance of getting an\noverall majority. If this\nremain alliance had the\nability to change who\nwould be our next prime\nminister, maybe this\nwould all be worthwhile\nbut for having such a small\nimpact, compromising\ncore party issues is really\ndisappointing and disenfranchising genuinely\npassionate Green voters.\nOn the other side of the\nchasm, there is the Brexit\nParty. This week, their\nking, Nigel Farage, made\nhis own leave alliance. He\ndecided not to field candidates in seats where there\nis a sitting Conservative\nmember of parliament.\nThis is a sensible decision\nand will reduce the\nchances of a split leave\nvote allowing remain candidates to sneak in. Brexit\nis of course Nigel Farage\u2019s\nraison d\u2019etre. We can only\nhope that after it is all\nresolved in the year 2054,\nBy taking themselves\noff the ballot, the Brexit\nParty is restricting the\nchoice of the electorate.\nVoters who were inspired\nby the party\u2019s pledge of a\nreal clean Brexit are now\nbeing mugged off and told\nto vote for the Tories and\ntheir soft Brexit.\nSimilarly, with the\nLib Dems, the actual\nimpact on the outcome\nof the election of this\ndecision is not certain.\nThe Conservatives really\nneed to win seats if they\nwant a majority, and in\nmany seats, they would\npotentially win were a\nBrexit Party candidate not\nstanding. So is this fundamental shift in policy\nfor the Brexit Party worth\nit for the little returns it\ncould yield.\nAlthough the Green\nvoters being pushed to the\nLib Dems and the Brexit\nvoters who are being\ntold to vote Tory have\nvery little in common in\nterms of politics, they\nare both being left in the\ndust. These groups are\nbeing cheated as they can\nno longer vote for what\nthey truly believe in. This\nentire issue stems from\nthe outdated electoral\nsystem but in a way, these\nparties who would like to\nsee it reformed, are simply\ncaving in. If all parties had\nran everywhere the result\nof this election would\nprobably have been very\nweird due to the vote\nsplitting it would cause.\nHowever, such a result\ncould have presented an\neven stronger case for\nreform and proportional\nrepresentation.\nI feel sorry for these\nvoters who may feel lost\nand I can only tell them\none thing: Vote Labour.\nMap of the UK General Election Result 2017// Wikipedia\n\u201cThe Greens\nhave vanished\nin over 40\nseats\u201d\nhe will simply vanish into\na puff of smoke. This\nelection presents a real\nroute for a second referendum which could end\nup halting Brexit. So, for\nhim, making sure leave\nMPs sit on the benches in\nthe House of Commons is\nkey.\nThe oven ready Brexit\ndeal which Johnson is\npinning much of his campaigning on was initially\nrejected by Farage who\ncalled it a \u201creheating of\nMrs May\u2019s EU Treaty\u201d.\nFarage continued to be\nvery critical of Johnson\nand called for an unequivocal pledge for a no\ndeal Brexit. Many voters\nagreed with this and saw\nhis Brexit Party as the only\noption for a real Brexit.\n\n"

Out of\nover 35000 students sur-veyed, 38% stated that\nthey \u2018hated\u2019 that the UK\nis leaving the EU, while\na further 24% \u2018dislike\u2019\nit \u2013 totalling for a 62%\ndisapproval rating.\nThe statistics do not\nvary significantly between\nUK and international\nstudents, though there is\na notable split based on\ngender \u2013 58% of men,\n66% of women, and\n77% of those who identify otherwise responded\nwith \u2018hate\u2019 or \u2018dislike\u2019,\nshowing a significant\nstasticial variance.\nBy contrast, only 9%\nresponded that they \u2018liked\u2019\nor \u2018loved\u2019 the UK\u2019s proposed departure. A further\n28%ofstudentsresponded\nthat they feel \u2018indifferent\u2019\n\u2013 a statistic described by\nFelix\u2019s Ameena Hassan\nas \u201cexpected if it were an\nImperial-based study, but\nshocking considering it\nwas nationwide\u201d.\nThe apathetic cohort\nmayinsteadreflectadesire\nfor politicians to focus on\nother topics. When asked\nabout the topics they felt\nshould be the top priority,\n53% said climate change,\n21% were for healthcare,\nand only 17% for Brexit.\nStudents appear to feel\nthe urgency of globalised,\nexistential issues more\nheavily than more short-term and localised ones,\nperhaps encompassing an\nideology best described\nby one Imperial student\nspeaking to Felix: \u201cwe\nare in a globalised world;\nwe are meant to unite, not\nseparate each other.\u201d\nFelix interviewed\nstudents on the South\nKensington campus,\nand received a variety of\nresponses approximately\nin line with the survey\u2019s\nfindings. Most Imperial\nstudents felt strongly that\nBrexit will be negative\nfor the country, with the\nnext highest cohort being\nthose who said they did\nnot know anything about\nBrexit.\nOne student commented that Brexit had directly\naffected their decision\nto stay in or leave the\ncountry: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\nam going to stay after my\nstudies. It\u2019s sad but I have\nno idea what is going to\nhappen.\u201d They confirmed\nthat they would definitely\nhave stayed if Brexit was\nnot occurring.\nThis lack of certainty,\nand a resulting dearth of\noptimism, is shared na-tionwide. Only 7% of students responded that they\n\u2018love\u2019 or \u2018like\u2019 the thought\nof the UK\u2019s near-future \u2013\na 20% drop since last year\n\u2013 while over half (53%)\neither \u2018hate\u2019 or \u2018dislike\u2019 it.\nOn the matter of trust,\nthe statistics are even\nmore damning \u2013 particularly towards British poli-ticians. 84% distrust Boris\nJohnson and 76% distrust\nJeremy Corbyn. Almost\nthree-quarters of students\nwere convinced that the\nUK would not leave the\nEU on October 31st \u2013 a\nprediction that turned out\nto be accurate.\nAn interviewed Imperial student commented:\n\u201cLabour was against it,\nand now suddenly they\nare for it. Everyone\u2019s policies seem to change every\nday. It\u2019s confusing for the\npeople, because we don\u2019t\nknow who to trust.\u201d\nThe CEO of Dig-In,\nChris Platt, added: \u201cThese\nfindings are hard to hear -our student community is\nclearly concerned about\nits future. Much has been\nsaid in the past about\nthe split of leavers vs\nremainers being heavily\nweighted by age, but this\nlarge scale poll shows just\nhow opposed to Brexit\nthese young people - the\npotential future leaders\nof this country - feel. My\nhope is that their thoughts,\nfeelings and future\noutcomes are carefully\nconsidered by whichever\ngovernment is in power in\ntheir near future.\u201d\nHowever, there seems\nto be little faith that any\ngovernment, regardless\nof the general election\nresults, would be able to\ndeliver on their promises.\nAnother student said \u201ca\nnew parliament will have\nto renegotiate \u2013 that will\nbe another couple of years\nof delay. I don\u2019t think it\nwill happen in the next\nfive years.\u201d\nDespite the verbosity of\nmany students\u2019 comments\nabove, Comment Editor\nand reporter Charlie\nTitmuss noted a distinct\nreticence amongst students about the topic of\nBrexit. \u201cA lot of people\nwere initially happy to\ntalk to us, but as soon as\nwe mentioned Brexit they\nbacked off and were kind\nof scared to speak. It\u2019s still\na controversial topic even\nthree years later.\u201d\nSurvey Shows What Students Really Think of Brexit\nThe survey conducted across over 35,000 students showed that a significant majority oppose Brexit and deeply\ndistrust British politicians; student interviews conducted at Imperial corroborated\n\u201c62% of\nstudents\nnationally\n'hate' or\n'dislike' Brexit\u201d\nFelix is recruiting!\nThe People's Vote march on 23rd\nMarch 2019 // TeaMeister, Flickr\n\n"

The\nprofit that asset management firms make arises as\na result of a percentage fee\nfrom the total assets under\nits management (also\ncalled AUM - the total\nmarket value of all the\nassets that a firm holds).\nIs this Wealth \t\t\nManagement?\nIt is also worth mentioning the difference\nbetween asset and wealth\nmanagement industries \u2013\nboth are often confused\nand are wrongly used in-terchangeably. Although\nthe exact definition of\neach of those business\nunits highly depends on\nthe structure of a specific\nfinancial institution, the\ngeneralpurposeofthefield\nof wealth management is\nto supply high net worth\nindividuals (HNWIs) with\nthe full range of financial\nservices, ** which could\npotentially range from\nproviding custodian\nservices to forming the\nindividual investment\nsolutions based on their\nneeds. In other words,\nasset management is just\none part of more wider\nwealth management\nservices for HNWIs.\nLet\u2019s begin our analysis\nwith the most widely used\nparameter for splitting\nthe funds in two groups:\nwhether their assets are\nmanaged on an active or\npassive basis.\nActive Funds\nActive funds are constantly overseen by portfolio managers and the\nallocation of their assets\ncan vary on a regular\nbasis according to how\nthe market conditions\nare viewed by the funds\u2019\nmanagers. They can be\nfurther split up in two\nother sub-types:\n- Open-ended funds:\nthe number of shares are\nunlimited, they are sold\nto and redeemed from\ninvestors directly by the\nfund manager.\n- Close-end funds: there\nis a specific number of\n\u201cHedge funds\nare a special\ntype of asset\nmanagement\nfirms\n...obtaining\nthe largely\nabove-average\nreturns.\u201d\nFELIX\nFig 1. How the buy-side and sell-side bridge the gap between corporates and investors // CFI\nshares issued in the beginning by a fund manager,\nwhich is unchanged, and\nall the shares are sold and\nbought only in the market\n(not through the issuer).\nPassive Funds\nPassive funds on the\nother hand, just track a\nmarket index or a market\nsegment (e.g. S&P 500,\nFTSE100, MSCI), its\nasset allocation does not\nvary through time. The\nmost common form of\na passive fund are the\nexchange-traded funds\n(ETFs) which represent a\nbasket of various securities and trade exactly like\nstocks.\nTo observe the differences in greater details\nplease refer to the table\nprovided in Figure 2.\nGenerally, passive funds\nare more popular in\nthe periods of bull (i.e.\ngrowing) market, while\npassive funds experience\nan upturn in the bear (i.e.\nfalling) market. However,\nwith the recent large-scale\npopularisation of ETFs\nthis trend could change\nin the years to come as\nillustrated in Figure 4.\nIn addition to that,\nfunds can also be split up\naccording to asset classes\nthat they invest in. The\nmost common types of\nassets used include: equity\n(i.e. stocks), government\nbonds, corporate debt,\ncommodities and private\novershadowed and forgot-ten. Therefore, the aim of\nthis article is to introduce\nthe reader to the buy-side\nworld, specifically to asset\nmanagement firms and\nhedge funds.\nWhat do they do?\nSo what do asset\nmanagement firms do?\nExactly what the name\nsuggests: they assist their\nclients (which can both be\ncorporate and individual)\nwith investing into various\nmutual funds (i.e. a collection of different assets)\naccording to the clients\u2019\nneeds and goals.* That is\na pretty vague definition,\nisn\u2019t it? Well, this directly\nfollows from the fact that\n(as we will see later) the\nrange of services provided\nby different types of asset\nmanagement firm varies a\nlot, and thus it is difficult Fig 2.

He hopes he doesn\u2019t end\nup in prison\nCOMMENT\nCharles Titmuss\nComment Editor\nI\nt would appear that\nI have drawn the ire\nof two commentators\ndue to articles that I\nwrote a couple of weeks\nago. This is the last issue\nin which such an exchange\nwill feature as there are\nother issues that deserve\nour attention.\nBefore moving into\nthe bulk of my response,\nI would like to make the\nfollowing statements. Jun\nLiu\u2019s article is very keen\nto point out that I have\nbroken UK law. I would\nencourage him to take\nthese charges to the police.\nHowever, I would warn\nhim that wasting police\ntime is also an offence. I\nwould also appreciate it if\nYuchu Liu could read the\ncontent of my article more\nclosely. I specifically\nstated that \u201cI am absolutely not accusing the author\nof acting on behalf of the\nCCP.\u201d Do not mischarac-terise what I have said, it\nis intellectually dishonest\nand beneath us all.\nResponding to two\ndemands for apology is\nmore challenging than\nresponding to one. Therefore, I shall make the\nfollowing argument.\nChina in the international sense is a na-tion-state actor. Although\nit may act in concordance\nwith the will of the people\nof China, it is distinct\nfrom the people of China.\nIt takes the decisions and\nleads, and as such it must\nbe treated as the responsible party for actions that\nChina as a nation state\ncommits. The conflation\nof the people of China,\nwith the government of\nChina is a fundamental\nideological leap that I\nrefuse to make. In order\nto make that association,\none must suffer from a\nsurfeit of nationalism.\nThis prevents an individual from making rational\nand reasoned criticisms\n(or praise) of the government of the country in\nwhich one lives. I believe\nthat the articles by the\nauthors preceding these\npages illustrate this point\nperfectly. Both authors\nassociate themselves with\ntheir government and\nits actions to a degree\nwhere providing factually\ninaccurate and factually\nincomplete information is\nthe only way to reconcile\nthemselves with the situation as it is.\nAs an example of\nproviding a non-national-istic assessment of one\u2019s\ngovernment I would\nsay, in terms of foreign\npolicy, the UK over the\nlast twenty years, but\nby no means only in the\nlast twenty years, made a\nterrible decision to invade\nIraq and Afghanistan.\nHundreds of thousands of\ncivilians died and the UK\nhas failed to investigate its\nsoldiers that are accused\nof war crimes. This is\nof course, unacceptable.\nHowever, the UK government lets me write these\nthings without throwing\nme in prison and beating\nme, as has been the fate of\nmultiple Chinese journalists and activists. Thank\nyou, the UK government.\nI would briefly like to\ndive into the response\narticles that I received to\nexamine examples of a\nnot-so honest examination\nof facts. A good example\nthat appears in both\narticles is the denial that\nTiananmen square was a\nmassacre. The events on\n4th of June 1989 were the\nculmination of months of\nmostly peaceful protests\nthat were eventually met\nwith bullets and the steel\nof Chinese tanks. It is true\nthat around 20 Chinese\nsoldiers and policemen\nwere killed by protesters\nand many more were\nwounded. However, it is\nalso true that many more\ncivilian, unarmed protesters were brutally killed or\nwounded by the Chinese\nsecurity forces and many\nmore were subsequently\narrested. Estimates range\nbetween 300-1000 killed,\nwith many thousands\nbeing wounded.\nYuchu Liu\u2019s piece\nmake an extensive reference to what he describes\nas \u201cso-called re-education\ncamps.\u201dHisarticlefrankly\nand honestly admits to the\ncamp\u2019s purpose of arbitrarily detaining an entire\nethnic group. However, he\nfeels it is justified because\n, in his words, as Muslims\nthey are vulnerable to\nbecoming terrorists. This\nis of course, an obscene\nattempt to justify the\npresumption of guilt\nof Uyghur and Khazak\nminorities in Xinjiang,\nsimply because of their\nethnicity and religious\npractices. There is\ncurrently an aggressive\ncome a very long distance\naway from the initial mass\npeaceful protests. Despite\nthe violence of the Hong\nKong police and various\nunderhand strategies used\nby the pro-China side,\nsuch as the involvement\nof the Triads, I do not\nthink that petrol bombing\nand amateur archery is the\nway forward. However,\nat the same time, I think\nthe dogmatic response of\n\u201cHong Kong is China\u201d is\nunhelpful for the resolution of this situation. At\nthe root of the conflict is\nthe fact that some areas\nof China have separatist\nsentiments and China\nhas responded to these\nseparatist sentiments with\nvarying levels of brutality\nand inhumanity. The right\nto self determination is\nenshrined in the United\nNations charter, which\nChina is signed up to. To\ndeny the opportunity of\nHong Kongers to determine their own future for\nthemselves is in itself an\noverly repressive response\nto the issues of separatism\nand a symptom of the\nincreasingly assertive\nbehaviour of China on the\ninternational stage.\nOverall, I am afraid\nthat this debate has failed\nto convince me that I need\nto apologise. In fact, it\nhas convinced me of the\nopposite. Instead of complying with Yuchu Liu\u2019s\ndemand that I \u201ckeep my\nmouth shut, \u201d I\u2019ll probably\njust be more mouthy than\never.\nI will leave you, dear\nreader, with this: Free\nTibet, Taiwan Number\nOne, Glory to Hong Kong.\nAnd of course, make Xi\nJinping Winnie the Pooh\nagain.\nTiananmen Square Protests// Wikipedia\ncampaign against Islam in\nChina, executed brutally\nand without mercy at\nthe behest of the CCP\nleadership.

The\nentire Ground Floor of the\nGallery becomes a painting studio, an imaginary\nchapel and a room-sized\nexperiment in this immer-sive exhibition that leads\nyou through Da Vinci\u2019s\nmind.

    "content": "Binge of the week: Fleabag (Seasons 1 and 2)\nA perfect blend of comedy and pathos, play-turned-series Fleabag takes you through the journey of a broken,\nsexually voracious lady\nB\nBC\u2019s tragicomedy (yes,\nthis genre\nexists) Fleabag\ncenters around its titular\nrole Fleabag (played by\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge),\na young woman living\nin London, with the first\nseason focusing on the\nfeelings of guilt and\ngrief, while the second\nexploring the themes of\nlove and sin. Originally\nbased on Waller-Bridge\u2019s\n2013 one-woman show\nthat premiered at the\nEdinburgh Fringe, the TV\nseries presents a more\ncoherent production while\nretaining its interactive\nnature with the protagonist constantly breaking\nthe fourth wall, voicing\nher thoughts out loud to\nthe audience and staring\nstraight into the camera\nwhile doing so.\nThe most difficult part\nof the show is certainly\nbringing the two worlds\nof comedy and tragedy\ntogether, yet WallerBridge executes it flaw-lessly, both with her sharp\nwriting and her acting.\nFleabag\u2019s dark, witty\ncomments are often intertwined with her painful\nlosses. This perfect blend\nis not exclusive to Fleabag\nbut is vividly played\nout in other characters\nand scenes. The most\nthought-provoking words\nare often juxtaposed with\nthe most hysterical jokes,\nyet it just works. Both\nthe scenes where Fleabag\nvisits her counselor\n(played by Fiona Shaw)\nand where the businesswoman Belinda (played\nby Kristin Scott Thomas)\nrants about the pains of\nbeing a woman exemplify this tone perfectly.\nOne way Waller-Bridge\nretains the essence of her\none-woman-show in this\nseries is, as mentioned\nbefore, breaking the\nfourth wall. Many who\nchoose this approach use\na fixed screen and a voice-over, but Waller-Bridge\ndirectly incorporates this\ninto her acting, a choice\nthat is clearly fully intentional This brings out the\ncomedic elements, even\nat the most unexpected\nmoments and creates a\nseamless style of storytelling that bridges the\nplay and the series.\n\u201cHer way to\ncope with\neverything\nis through\ncopious\namounts of\nsex\u201d\nWhat stands out the\nmost for me is not the\ncinematography nor\nthe acting but the story\nitself. It is meaningful,\nimpactful, beautifully\nwritten and poignantly\ndelivered - it\u2019s been a\nwhile since I have related\nto a protagonist this much.\nThe two seasons are so\nsimilar yet so different.\nThe first season is a\nmultidimensional story\nthat unravels as Fleabag\nruns away from but eventually faces her trauma\nand losses and her way\nto cope with everything\nthrough copious amounts\nof sex. She is both the\nhero and the villain. The\nvery first episode already\nhints that Fleabag is\nmore than just a comedy.\nIt features Fleabag\u2019s\nmonologue as she turns\nup at her father\u2019s doorstep\nat two in the morning, \u201cI\nhave a horrible feeling I\nam a greedy, perverted,\nselfish, apathetic, cynical,\ndepraved, morally\nbankrupt woman who\ncan\u2019t even call herself a\nfeminist.\u201d Fleabag puts on\na facade of a put-together\nwoman but when you look\nunderneath it\u2019s riddled\nwith insecurities and shattered pieces of her heart.\nSometimes it feels like\nwe\u2019ve fucked everything\nup but it\u2019s life and we\ncan\u2019t run away from life.\nThe first season ends\nwith a speckle of hope\nand would have been an\namazing standalone, but\nthe second season adds\na necessary layer to the\nalready-perfect show.\nIn the second season,\nwe see a brand new\nFleabag, trying to let go\nof the past and move on\nto the future, and she\nmeets someone, more\nspecifically, a Catholic\npriest (played by Andrew\nScott, and dubbed as \u201cthe\nhot priest\u201d all over the\ninternet). As Fleabag puts\nit, \u201cThis is a love story.\u201d\nIndeed it is but not just\nFleabag\u2019s, but also her\nsister Claire\u2019s (played\nby Sian Clifford) as well\nas her father\u2019s (played\nby Bill Paterson) and\ngodmother\u2019s (played by\nOlivia Colman). Here we\nsee Waller-Bridge delving\ndeep into many forms of\nlove, with the iconic line\n\u201cI think you know how\nto love better than any\nof us. That\u2019s why you\nfind it all so painful.\u201d It\u2019s\namazing that even with\nsuch a short series, there\nis phenomenal character\ndevelopment, and every\nFleabag goes to church // Amazon\nISSUE 1735\nFELIX\nTELEVISION tv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n21\nTELEVISION\nJia Qi Tan\nTelevision Editor\nCreator: Phoebe WallerBridge Starring: Phoebe\nWaller-Bridge, Sian Clifford,\nOlivia Colman, Bill Paterson\nSeason 1\nSeason 2\ncharacter has a moment\nof redemption or vul-nerability. Every detail,\nevery scene, every line is\nexquisitely crafted. The\nending is heartbreakingly\nbeautiful, with Alabama\nShakes\u2019s \u201cThis Feeling\u201d\nadding the perfect touch\nto the final scene.\nIt\u2019s been confirmed that\nthe second season is the\nfinal season of Fleabag,\nperhaps because WallerBridge feels like she has\ntold the story she needs to\ntell. Her brutally candid\nwriting combined with her\nskillful performance has\ncreated a show that is so\nendearing, hilarious, and\nemotional. It\u2019s so shockingly relatable that I keep\nfinding shadows of myself\nwith Fleabag\u2019s every emotional breakdown, and\nthere is no doubt that this\nhas risen to the top of the\nlist of my favorite shows\nof all time.\n\n"

    "content": "I Will Still Be Whole (When You Rip Me in Half)/\nBefore I Was a Bear\nDouble-bill production: an emotional play depicting mother-daughter bonds followed by a one-woman dark\ncomedy production\nI\nWill Still Be Whole\n(When You Rip Me\nin Half) harnesses\nyou from the offset,\nthe two characters stand\nfacing outwards towards\nthe audience, hands by\ntheir sides and speaking\nwith urgency. It describes\nthe events that take place\nfor a young woman, EJ\n(Aoife Hinds), and her\nestranged mother, Joy\n(Tuyen Do), prior to and\nduring their first meeting\nin 22 years. It navigates\ntheir emotional struggle\nas they face their fears\nof inadequacy, loss of\ndirection and loneliness.\nThe artful stage management encapsulates the\ntone of the play perfectly,\nthe subtle interactions\nbetween the characters\nas they enact their separate stories manages to\nshow the enthralling and\nemotional bond between\nboth Joy and EJ. Hinds\nwas particularly magnetic\nin her role,skillfully depicting the EJ\u2019s struggles\nwith abandonment and\nloss of direction with\nthe necessary emotion, a\nheartbreaking listlessness\nand enough humour to\nlighten the heavy subjects\nat hand. Joy\u2019s story was\nperhaps the more complex\none, working through\nfeeling trapped and\nincapable of providing\nsufficient care and love\nfor her daughter.\nThe opening scene\nstrikes a stark contrast\nbetween the two: EJ\u2019s\nanger and insecurity are\nhighlighted from her first\nlines, as are Joy\u2019s feelings\nof fear, resentment and\nsadness. The characters\ndon\u2019t fully address each\nother until the very end.\nThe majority of the\nplay is spent with them\ndancing- figurative-ly- around each other,\navoiding each other\u2019s\ngaze, but still tentatively\nreaching for each other.\nThe audience feels a sense\nof responsibility for both\nof the characters, and the\n\u201cThe audience\nis drawn into\nthis weirdly\nwonderful\nproduction\nfurther\nby Cally\u2019s\ninteraction\nwith its\nmembers\u201d\nwriting manages to instill\na sense of empathy for\nboth, as the central themes\nof self-destructiveness,\nloss, anxiety and lack of\nfulfilment are common\nfeelings in most people.\nImpatience laces the lines\nthey deliver, you get a\nsense of \u2018waiting\u2019 as they\nundergo their menial day-to-day tasks. On occasion,\nhowever, the story is quite\ndifficult to follow, the\nabundance of metaphors\nat times unnecessary and\nthrusting the audience\ninto a spiral of trying to\ntranslate the meaning\nbehind every act. All-inall this play is a beautiful\ndepiction of love, loss and\nexpectation and delivered\na thought-provoking\nperspective on moth-er-daughter relationships.\nThe dancing bear in\nthe opening scene of this\n\u2018Before I was a Bear\u2019\nis more than enough to\npull the audience in and\nconvince them to invest\ntheir full and unfaltering\nfocus into Cally\u2019s (the\nbear) story. Even without\nthe mask, Cally, is incredibly endearing and relata-ble. Her complex persona\nis portrayed by the actor,\nJacoba Williams, and\nwriter, Eleanor Tindall,\ndelivering the line \u2018my\nvoice is bountiful and\nheavy and full\u2019 which\nintroduces the perfect\npitch for the start of this\none-woman-play.\nThe audience is drawn\ninto this weirdly wonderful production further by\nCally\u2019s interaction with its\nmembers, handing individuals a variety of props\nshe uses in the play. Cally\ndescribes the transition\nfrom the \u2018unstoppable\u2019\nfeelings of childhood\nto the insecurities and\nobsessions of the young\nteenager with startling\naccuracy, her eager smile\nand fervent way of communicating her arguments\nwith her brother reflecting\nher youth. Some of the\nmore impactful themes of\nthis play is its exploration\nof friendship and sexual-ity. The unstable nature\nof friendship is explored\nin her account of events\nand the roles of perspective and self-interest are\nconveyed with profound\naccuracy.\nThe main storyline is\ncentralized around her\nobsession and affair with\na married TV detective.\nIt reflects the modern\nproblems surrounding\nsocial media and the tendencies of society towards\nvillainization and victimization of women in an\naddress which rang with\nan Attwood-like analysis.\nHer subsequent isolation\nis explored through her\nlife as a bear, her shame,\nherlackofselfcareandher\nfeelings of not belonging.\nCally\u2019s pain is delivered\nprofoundly in the words\n\u2018they want me dead.\u2019 The\nfeelings of loneliness\nand self-doubt are rife\nthroughout this play. Its\ndelivery is combined with\nplenty of humour and it\nprovides the audience\nwith an enjoyable evening\nbut its analysis of the\nmore modern issues of\nsociety, specifically for\nyoung women, are what\nmake this play most worth\nthe watch.\nThe production itself\nis given a more \u2018home-y\u2019\nfeel by the surroundings.\nThe Bunker Theater is\na small former parking\ngarage down a nondescript alley which was\ndifficult to locate but\nworth the search. Mismatching chairs surround\nthe small stage and fairy\nlights are hung along the\nceiling- it\u2019s a perfectly\nInstagrammable place.\nFor any potential viewers,\nhowever, I would recommend maybe bringing a\npillow if attending the\ndouble bill production,\nthe chairs are designed for\ntheir aesthetic not for their\ncomfort. The audience\nand the staff helped to\nmake the environment\neven warmer, investing\nfully in the characters\nfrom the start to the end\nof the show, laughing uproariously at appropriate\npoints and more importantly listening when the\nscene required it.\nOverall the experience\nwas an extremely enjoyable one, with credit going\nto both the environment\nand the skills of the actors.\nOn a more personal note,\non further research I\nfound out that the Bunker\nTheatre is to close down\nin 2020, which feels like a\nloss to the arts community\nof London.

    "content": "Take You and Your Study Buddy to Shake Shack\nPronto!\nFOOD\nZahra Abiola\nFood Editor\nS\ntudents of Imperial\nCollege London,\nwe have been done\na great disservice.\nThere is a trendy, self-ser-vice, American burger\nplace right beside South\nKensington station. And\nit\u2019s the one that doesn\u2019t\nhave a student discount.\nIf you are tired of a\nspecific number of men\nnot appreciating you, you\ncan do the slight trek to\nyour closest Shake Shack.\nYes, I know that means\nheading to Victoria or\nPiccadilly, but they have a\nnew student deal to make\nit worth your while.\nShake Shack now offers\ntwo for the price of one on\ntheir burgers for you and\nyour study buddy. Your\nlab partner will hate you\na lot less for always being\nunavailable if you offer to\nget them a burger. Simply\nshow this offer from your\nUNiDAYS account which\nyou all have access to as\nstudents. This deal runs\nfrom Sunday to Wednesday, so make sure you are\ntactical about your visits.\nThe deal says that the\ntwo people also have to\nbe there as you order so\nmay not be able to finesse\nyourself a double serving.\nI took a friend down to the\none in Leicester Square\nduring a day out in Central\nto see if it was worth the\ntrip out.\nLike with Pizza Union,\nyou get a pager with your\n\u201cThese burgers\nare well put\ntogether.\nThese burgers\nmanage to\nstay awake in\ntheir 9ams\u201d\n\u201cAll the\ntextures\nand flavours\ncombining in\neach bite made\nthis one an\nexperience\u201d\norder with their green\nlogo. In fact, these two\nrestaurants have a really\nsimilar aesthetic. Green\nis their accent colour all\nover the store, giving\nHalloween vibes against\na black backdrop. Their\nseats are mostly arranged\nconnected to a long table\nso you will find yourself\nwith not a lot of personal\nspace most of the time.\nWe got the Double Shack\nBurger and the Shack\nStack, coming to \u00a38.75\nfor the both of us. That\ncomes out as less for each\nof us than the dog food\nthey sell. Yes, they sell\ndog food. And no, I don\u2019t\nknow why.\nFirstly, you\u2019ve got to\nappreciate how beautiful\nthese burgers are. These\nburgers are well put\ntogether. These burgers\nhave done all their\nproblem sheets. These\nburgers go for all their\nclasses. These burgers\nmanage to stay awake in\ntheir 9ams. These burgers\nsubmit their coursework\nearly. These burgers are\non 12 societies\u2019 commit-tee. These burgers already\nhave their internships\nsorted. And they tasted\ngood. Really good.\nThe Double Shack\nBurger is the remix for\ntheir classic cheeseburger\nnow with an extra patty.\nThe veggies were fresh\nand their special ShackSauce really complimented the whole thing. What\nsurprised me was for the\noriginal price, the patties\nthemselves are rather\nsmall. I know it\u2019s quality\nover quantity because you\ncan really taste the difference compared to your\naverage burger spot but\nat that price, I need thicc\nwith at least 3 \u2018c\u2019s.\nThe Shack Stack\nconsists of their cheesy\n\u2018Shroom patty and a beef\npatty for good measure.\nThe \u2018Shroom patty was\nactually the highlight of\nthe visit for me and that is\nsaying something as they\nwere both so good. I know\nthe vegetarians reading\nthis are rolling their eyes\nas they don\u2019t need another\nmushroom burger, but\nthis was better than the\nactual meat. The deep-fried breading was crispy\nand really well seasoned\nyet the mushroom in the\ncentre wasn\u2019t overdone\nand still had its structure. I\ngot a surprise at the cheese\noozing out of the breading\nfrom my first bite. The\nportobello mushroom\nadds some serious height\nto the burger to mitigate\nthe beef\u2019s thinness. The\nbeef still brings a great\ncontrast to the crispy\nmushroom as you bite\nthrough. All the textures\nand flavours combining in\neach bite made this one an\nexperience.\nPlaces like Shake Shack\nrepresent a new trend. You\nget restaurant quality food\nwhile keeping the fast\nfood feel to the establish-ment. The food looks like\nthere was a lot more care\nand effort put into making\nit compared to the average\nMaccies (though the beef\npatties are still the same\nsize). Everything here\nlooks and tastes fresher.\nYet there is still no one\npestering you on if you\nwant any more drinks or\nhow your meal is going to\nget a tip like at a Byron\u2019s\nand it stays open later\nthan a service restaurant.\nIt\u2019s really the best of both\nworlds but this also brings\nboth disadvantages.\nYou can\u2019t exactly book\nyourself a spot and those\nbenches can fill up fast\nduring lunchtime. And\nI\u2019ve seen a fair number\nof fights break out on my\nlate-night trips there. It\u2019s\nnot good for anything\nmore than a casual meal\nwith some standards.\nFood quality to price ratio\nis a very difficult one to\nbalance but with this deal,\nthe scales seem to have\ntipped in Shake Shack\u2019s\nfavour.\nMushroom was the highlight of this burger // Zahra Abiola\nISSUE 1735\nFRIDAY, 22ND\nNOVEMBER, 2019\nFOOD food.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n36\nCheese shining brighter than my future // Zahra Abiola\n\n"

The type\nof vengeance felt when\nyou twig on to the fact\nyour flatmate has been\nknowingly using your\nmilk without the common\ndecency of asking. We\nwere going for blood\u2026\n(hehe and boy did we get\nit.)\nAs we took to the pitch\none thing was glaringly\nobvious. These chaps\nwere blind. Either that or\nthey had never looked in\na mirror to observe the\ncolour clashing monstrosity that was their kit.

Yes, in\nfact do you sell a set of\nmismatching tiles that\nare an orgy of red?\u201d well\nthat kids\u2026 that was their\nplaying top. Accompanied\nby horridly blood red\nshorts.

For this reason,\nscienti\ufb01c discussion\nshouldn\u2019t be limited only\nto those with science\nbackgrounds.

Babies\nborn from disadvantaged\nfamilies grow up facing\nthe additional task of\novercoming numerous\nbarriers just to get a shot\nat opportunities freely\navailable to the rest of\nsociety. This is the sombre\ntruth published in a report\nby the Social Mobility\nCommission (State of the\nNation 2018-19: Social\nMobility in Great Britain).\nToday, education is\none of the biggest factors\ndetermining the trajectory\nof the rest of our lives.\nA good foundation is the\nstarting point for access\nto higher education, a\nspecialist technical job, or\nan apprenticeship to earn\na stable livelihood. But\nfor a disadvantaged child\ncontending with societal,\nfinancial, and geographical barriers, gaining\nthis foundation alone is\nalready a feat in itself.\nAnd it shows.\nAccording to the\nreport, 43% of five-year-olds eligible for free\nschool meals (FSM) did\nnot achieve a good level\nof development in 2018\n(as measured by the\nearly years foundation\nstage profile assessment\nframework). This figure\nis almost twice as much\nas non-FSM-eligible\nstudents at 26%. A 2018\nstudy by the Education\nPolicy Institute (EPI) discovered that persistently\ndisadvantaged pupils\n\u2013 those who qualified for\nFSM for over 80% of\ntheir schooling time \u2013 are\n22.6 months behind their\npeers when they finish\ntheir GCSEs. By the end\nof secondary school, disadvantaged students were\non average 18.1 months\nbehind their peers in 2018,\nincreasing from 17.9\nmonths in 2017. Youths\nwithout good GCSE\nresults are 27 times more\nlikely to be unemployed.\nGoing into higher education is just yet another\nhurdle. While more\nstudents from low income\nfamilies are now entering\nuniversity by age 19, only\n5% of students eligible for\nFSM are accepted to the\nmost selective universities\nas compared to 12% of\nall students. Even then,\nfinancial and cultural\nbarriers mean that these\nstudents are more likely to\ndrop out of university.\n\u201cEducational inequality\non this scale is bad for\nboth social mobility and\neconomic productivity,\u201d\nsays David Laws, executive chairman of the EPI\nand a former coalition\ngovernment schools\nminister. Rosamund\nMcNeil,Assistant General\nSecretary of the National\nEducation Union, shares\nthis sentiment in her\ncall-to-action: \u201cThe\nGovernment must commit\nto proactively reducing\nchild poverty and commit\nto ending it. They must\nalso provide what schools\nneed to make education\naccessible\u2026 Schools\ncan be the place where\nstudents gain a sense of\noptimism and agency\nabout their futures, but\nwe\u2019re not giving schools\nwhat they need to make\nthis difference.\u201d\nSo, what ARE we\ndoing? What can YOU, as\na British citizen, do to help\nbridge this unacceptable\nsocietal gap? Well, bright\nand promising Imperial\nCollege student, you are\nnow at a prime position to\nmake a change.\nStudents can gain a\nPost Graduate Certificate\nof Education (PGCE) and\nQualified Teaching Status\n(QTS) after an undergraduate degree in any subject\nstudied either in the degree\nor at A Levels. Become\na teacher and make the\nbest use of your intellect\nand heart for others to\nhelp make a positive\nimpact in the lives of the\nover 4.1 million children\nacross the country living\nin poverty. Due to a\nnation-wide shortage of\nteachers, trainee teachers\nin STEM disciplines are\neligible for some of the\nhighest first-year government bursaries of up\nto \u00a332,000. Overall, less\nthan half of the physics\nteachers in the UK possess\na relevant degree, with\nfigures dropping to as low\nas 17% in poorer areas.\nIf this article made you\nfeel anything at all about\nthe state of social mobility\nin the UK, investigate\nthe possibility of gaining\nyour of\ufb01cial teaching\nquali\ufb01cations with Ark\nTeacher Training (ATT),\nwho aim to provide a good\neducation to every pupil,\nregardless of background\nor status, to give them real\nchoices in life.

It is even more\nrewarding when such happenings involve a place\nlike Africa, a continent\nwhose history has been\nusually associated with\nviolence, from slavery to\nforgotten genocides such\nas those against the Tutsis\ninRwandaandtheHereros\nin Namibia. Although\nrare, such tragedies still\nhappen, as the world was\nreminded last month when\nEthiopian Prime Minister\nAbiy Ahmed was awarded\nthe Nobel Peace Prize for\nhis role in the reestablish-ment and normalisation\nof relationships between\nEthiopia and neighbouring Eritrea. The dispute\nbetween the two countries\nwas caused by the frontier\nbetween them: a frontier\nthat sparked two years of\nwar, from 1998 to 2000,\nwhich only came to a halt\ndue to a ceasefire being\nreached, but without a\npeace treaty. The conflict\nwas still officially ongoing until last year. Entire\nfamilies living in proximity of the border as well\nas a considerable distance\naway from it, given the\ndeep bond between those\nnations, were torn apart\nfor almost 20 years.\nTo understand the\nissue better, it might\nhowever be useful to\ntake a step back to the\nend of the 19th Century.\nIn this period jingoism\nruled over Europe and\nthe world economy was\nrevolutionising itself on\nthe wave of the Second\nIndustrial Revolution:\nthirst for new lands\nwas the result of such\nconditions for most\nwestern European coun-tries. Among them was\na newly formed nation,\nItaly, whose interests\nbefell Eritrea. The\ncountry, with its coast\nfacing the Red Sea, was\nlocated in a wonderful\nposition for trade given\nthe recent opening of\nthe Suez Canal. Consequently, the maritime\ncompany Rubattino\nmanaged to buy some\nland in the area, which\nwas later to be sold to\nthe Italian State. This\nmarked the beginning\nof the Italian rule in\nAfrica; before the end of\nthe century two attempts\nwere carried out by the\nItalians to expand into\nthe mainland by conquering neighbouring\nEthiopia. In both cases\na staunch resistance by\nthe Ethiopians, along\nwith a chronic disorgan-isation of the Italians,\ndelayed their overthrow-al. It was only in 1935\nthat the fascist regime\nmanaged to conquer\nthe region as part of\nthe newly established\nItalian East Africa, also\ncompromising of Eritrea\nand Somalia. This domination lasted however\njust until 1941, when\nBritish troops occupied\nthe colony during World\nWar II. At the end of this,\nwhile Ethiopia regained\nits independence,\nSomalia and Eritrea\npassed under British\nadministration, as a\nprovisional measure. In\nthis context Ethiopian\nemperor Haile Selassie\nsuccessfully pushed for\nthe transferring of the\nlatter under his country\u2019s\nsovereignty. However,\nsuch happening sparked\nan armed fight for inde-pendence, which lasted\n30 years from 1961 to\n1991. Finally, in 1993\na referendum under the\nsupervision of the UN\ntook place and decided\nalmost unanimously for\nEritrea\u2019s independence.\nIn 1998, as stated\nabove, war broke out\nagain due to old scars and\nthe dispute surrounding\nto whom the bordering\ntown of Badme should\nbold PM. Seeking peace\nwith Eritrea is not the\nonly risky move Ahmed\nhas undertaken in his\nshort mandate; among\nother things he has freed\nthousands of political\nprisoners and foster\nactions to decrease\ngender disparity in\nan authoritarian and\ndeeply traditional land.\nHe has also been the\ntarget of some murder\nattempts, including an\nexplosion at one of his\nrallies. His approach\nof drastic reform has\ncaused discomfort for\nmany, including the\ncountries own military.\nHaving said that,\nEthiopia remains an\noppressive country and\nthere is yet much to do\nto ensure things change\nconsistently, especially\nto ensure that next year\nelections are carried out\nin a fully democratic\nway. The well-deserved\nNobel Prize Abiy\nAhmed won should not\ntherefore lead to his\npolitical sanctification,\nas happened prematurely (and as it has been\nrevealed, wrongly) to\nmany other Nobel lau-reates. This shall instead\ntake place in a long time\nto come, when it will\nbe known whether the\nprinciple of freedom\nwill have imposed itself\nor succumbed in its fight\nwith authoritarianism.\nEthiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed // Wikimedia\n\u201cSeeking\npeace with\nEritrea is\nnot the only\nrisky move\nAhmed has\nundertaken\nin his short\nmandate\u201d\nbelong to. The ensuing\nceasefire established\na joint Eritrean and\nEthiopian commission\nwith the goal of solving\nthe border issue. This\nruled for Badme to be\nassigned to Eritrea,\nwhich Ethiopia refused\nto comply with until\nlast year, when Prime\nMinister Ahmed\npromised to fully implement the decision.\nOn 11th September\nthe border between\nthe nations was finally\nreopened, signing an\nimpressive success for\nthe newly appointed but\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1735\nFELIX\n7\nPUZZLES fsudoku@imperial.ac.uk\nA CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFor example, a stance on a\nstudent protest occurring\nin 2015 would be voted\non, and that stance would\nbecome official Union\npolicy for three years,\nlong beyond its relevance.\nTo fix that, we\u2019re trying\nto change the way it\nworks. We have an action\ntracker at Council, which\nis a record of specific\nactions that need to be\ntaken \u2013 a description of\nthe action, the person\nresponsible, and a date\nby which it needs to have\nbeen completed or by\nwhich an update needs to\nbe prepared.\nThen stances which\nhave a long-term rele-vance, such as our stance\nthat the College should not\nlevy academic sanctions\nto enforce the payment of\nnon-academic debt \u2013 like\nhalls rent. We\u2019re strongly\nagainst that, and it\u2019s a\nstanding policy of the\nUnion, and should be a\nlong-term policy.\nWith regards to them\nall currently being\nlapsed \u2013 we\u2019re fixing\nthat too. Predominantly\nthe Council Chair, Lloyd\nJames, alongside the\nOTs and other members\nof staff, have done a big\npiece of work on looking\nat those old policies.\nWe\u2019ve scrapped old ones\nthat were no longer timely,\nmerged several policies\nwith similar remits,\nand then renewed those\ntemporarily for one year.\nWe\u2019ve then adapted the\nsystem to give more power\nto the various subcommittees of Council, so that\nthey own certain policies\nwhere that policy falls\nunder their specific remit\nrather than them all being\nheld by Union Council.\nThe subcommittees represent a broader and more\nrelevant cross-section of\nour student volunteers.\nFelix: Odd segue, but\n\u2013 there have been\nmany health and\nsafety complaints at\nthe Union recently,\nand there has been a\nchange in the health\nand safety committee in the Union. Can\nyou shed any light?\nAS: We\u2019ve had a Health\nand Safety Committee for\nmany years, but now it\u2019s\nbeen \u2018promoted\u2019 in the\norganisational chart; it\u2019s\nbeing given a higher level\nof seniority to reflect the\nimportance of health and\nsafety as an issue within\nthe Union. It is chaired\nby one of the external\nmembers of the Board of\nTrustees, Graham, and has\nstudent representatives as\nwell as the Deputy Presidents of Education as well\nas Finance and Services\non it too. Various staff\nmembers have responsibilities for health and\nsafety around the Union,\nand they attend meetings\nwith the committee to\nreport in and be held ac-countable.\nFelix: Was this\nchange instigated\nby the various complaints about health\nand safety recently?\nAS: Actually, I believe\nit predates some of those\nmore recent escalating\nproblems \u2013 we just\nthought it was very\nimportant. It no longer\nreports into Finance and\nRisk, because it isn\u2019t just\nabout a list of risks, and\nis now established on an\nequivalent level.\nFelix: How are the\nhealth and safety\nissues being ad-dressed?\nAS: We as the Leadership Team realised that we\nneed more staff support to\naddress health and safety\nissues in the Union. At the\nmoment it is split between\nmany people \u2013 operational staff like bar managers\nand such, in various ways\n\u2013 and we need at least one\nperson for whom it is their\nfull-time job and specific\nremit. That is what will\nhelp bring food back to\n568, for example.\nSee this week\u2019s News\nabout the closure of food\nservice in 568.\nFelix: I want to briefly\ntouch on the food\nservice situation in\nh-bar, given that\n568 currently is not\noffering food either\n\u2013 what\u2019s happening\nwith that?\nAS: It\u2019s been gone for\na while now \u2013 we gave a\nbig update about this via\nFelix a few weeks ago.\nThe Deputy President\n(Finance and Services)\nand I are working with\nvarious people in the\nUnion and College, such\nas the Head of Catering, to\nfurther discussions about\nbringing food back to\nh-bar within the timescale\nof weeks \u2013 rather than it\nbeing a really long time.\nWhether that will be a\nfull menu or a limited\nservice will depend on\nwhat services the College\nis able to put behind this.\nWe know how big an issue\nthis is, and it\u2019s a priority\nfor us to try to fix it.\nFelix: Let\u2019s talk about\na couple of the big\nprojects you\u2019ve been\nworking on, rather\nthan day-to-day fire-fighting! So, you\u2019ve\nsubmitted an ethical\ninvestment paper to\nthe College Council?\nFor reference, College\nCouncil is the governing\nand executive body of the\nuniversity, composited\nof external members,\ndeans of faculties, senior\nCollege management,\nand Abhijay as a student\nrepresentative.\nAS: Yes! There is a\ncampaign at Imperial\ncalled \u2018Divest Imperial\u2019,\nwhose goal is to get the\nuniversity to take its\nmoney out of fossil fuels.\nThey successfully passed\npapers at the Union\nCouncil in 2014 and 2017\nthat made it our policy not\nto invest in fossil fuels\nwith our limited investment portfolio. At that\ntime we surveyed students\nabout what they felt we\nshould or should not be\nputting our money into \u2013\nand the results came back\nsaying that we should\nnot invest into things\nlike tobacco, the arms\nindustry, fossil fuels, or\namusingly even pornogra-phy! The Union was also\nmandated to campaign to\nget the College to divest\nfrom fossil fuels. Previous\nUnion Presidents since\nthen have hit a brick\nwall trying to make that\nhappen, and I don\u2019t think\nit has been a priority for\nthem.\nMore holistically, fossil\nfuels are not the sole\nmatter over which you can\nhave a debate here. There\nare other types of investments too. For example,\nthe College is not meant to\nbe invested in tobacco due\nto their relationship with\nthe Wellcome Trust. I ran\nfor this role on a platform\non ending unethical\ninvestments generally,\nand I think it\u2019s important\nthe College considers the\nethical ramifications of\nwhere it keeps its money.\nIt\u2019s important for publicly\nfunded forward-looking\nscientific institutions\nto think about that kind\nof thing when it makes\ndecisions. I have therefore\nwritten a paper for College\nCouncil with support\nfrom Fifi, the DPFS, and\nFrancesca, the Ethics and\nEnvironment Officer,\nwhich suggests taking the\nfirst step \u2013 getting student\nand staff representatives,\nexperts, and the senior\nstaff responsible for\nthe College\u2019s financial\ndecisions together to talk\nabout these issues. We\u2019re\nnot demanding from the\nget-go that the College\ndoesn\u2019t invest in certain\ncompanies or some such,\nbut we want to agree on\na set of principles. There\nwill be disagreement, but\nI believe College Council\nwill agree to create that\ngroup and we will be due\nto report back early next\nyear. We will get the information from the experts,\nand make an informed\ndecision that way.\nFelix: The College\nhave regularly defended their position\nby stating that they\nbelieve they need to\nwork with fossil fuel\ncompanies \u2013 have\nyou come up with an\nargument you think\nwill convince them?\nAS: No.And this is why\nI am not taking a paper that\nsays \u201cyou must take your\nmoney out of fossil fuel\ncompanies\u201d. I\u2019m taking a\npaper that says \u201clet\u2019s talk\nabout ethical investment\u201d.\nIf you open a discussion\nwith the former, about\nthat specific issue, the\ndoor gets closed in your\nface and you don\u2019t get any\ntraction. It stops any discussion of other changes\nthat could be made to the\ninvestment portfolio. And\nit makes people both in\nDivest and in the College\nangry and frustrated. I\u2019m\ntrying to create a forum\nwhere we can discuss the\nissues in a constructive\nfashion, where the door\nis open and we can begin\ntalking about what the\nsocial responsibility of\nthe university is when it\ncomes to its investment\nportfolio.\nThe College Council\nmeeting at which this\npaper will be presented is\non the date of publication,\nFriday the 22nd\n.\nFelix: A related\ndiscussion is to do\nwith the upcoming\nplanned climate\nstrikes \u2013 what do you\nknow about that?\nAS: So this is an\ninitiative organised by\nthe staff trade union,\nthe UCU, following the\naction they took in September before the start of\nterm. They\u2019re staging a\nlunchtime protest on the\nQueen\u2019s Lawn at 12.30 on\nNovember 29th. If this is\nan issue any student feels\npassionate about, I would\nencourage them to go and\nlend support.\nFelix: At some point,\ndo you see the Union\nsupporting student\nstrikes or lecture\nwalkouts over climate or sustainability issues?\nAS: It\u2019s an interesting\ntopic for debate. I don\u2019t\nwant to speak for the\nUnion generally, but if\nsomeone brought a paper\nto Union Council about\nit I would personally\nprobably support it \u2013 depending on the specific or\nexact content in the paper.\nIt\u2019s an important issue\nand our generation are the\nones who will really start\nfeeling it.\nFelix: Regarding\nyour other project,\nthere has been big\nnews this week about\nrent renegotiations,\nwhich we discussed\nlast time we spoke.\nThere is an event that\nwent up on Thursday night about a\nmeeting about rent\nissues? What\u2019s happening currently?\nThe Union and College\nperiodically have negotiations about the price\nof rent in halls. This one\nhas come about in time\nwith the development\nof new halls in Acton,\nwhich roughly doubles\nthe number of bedspaces\nout there, along with\nother changes to the rent\nportfolio. Historically,\nwhen these negotiations\ncome up, the DPW and\nUnion President take the\ndifferent options to the\nUnion Council.\nThe Council meetings\nare public, and we think\nstudents will really care\nabout this issue. We\u2019ll be\nholding that meeting in\nthe Read Lecture Theatre\nat 7 PM on the 3rd\nof\nDecember, and talking\nabout this and inviting\npresentations from any\nstudent who wants to have\ntheir voice heard.\n\n"
