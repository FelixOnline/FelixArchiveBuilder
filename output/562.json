    "content": "Compiled by Phil Webb, Sports Editor\nWeights Club\nTHE facilities of IC Weights Club are:a ten stage multi gym, housed in the College Sports centre and conventional weights, housed in a room under the College Health Centre( quite convenient!). Certain periods are reserved for Weights Club members only on the facilities.\nThese times are:12:002:30 pm Monday to Saturday( inclusive) and5:308:30 pm on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday evenings. The multi gym is very safe and easy to use, so women are also\nwelcome to join and use the apparatus. I'm sure that a demonstration can be arranged for anyone unsure of how to use it.\nTo join IC Weights Club first\npurchase a membership card( cost\n\u00a3 \\ ) from the Secretary of the Club: Andy Loran s(Ci vEng3), who can be found in the Union Lower Lounge at lunchtimes. You may then use the multi gym, during Weights Club hours on payment of the normal15 p entry fee, or you may purchase a season\nticket to the Sports centre for \u00a33\n(i.e. at a discount oi \u00a31) and use\nthe multi gym whenever you want and go swimming without paying the entry fee. The key for the conventional weights room is kept at the Sports centre cash desk and maybe borrowed on production of your Weights Club membership card( same payment conditions apply). Finally, someone mentioned at\nthe Fresher s' Fair that last year there was not really a\" club spirit\" in the Weights Club. I agree and believe that as since we do not compete against anyone, as\ndo the rugby or footballclubs, etc. We have no need to instil a' club spirit' as such, because most people have their own training methods and prefer to train on their own. However, if anyone has any ideas as\nto how to rectify this situation, we would be glad to hear from you. Steve Gunn\nThe Links Cup\nTHE Links Cup was awarded this\nyear( posthumously) to the Hockey Club due to their highly successful\nyear last session. The Links Cup is\nan award made annually by the Athletic Clubs Committee to the sporting club with the most success in the preceeding season.\nThe trophy was awarded on a vote at ACC by17 votes to 16\nwith Sailing Club a close second It was agreed at ACC to make this award eventhough the trophy itself was amongst those\nstolen earlier this season.\nBasketball\nHEY, all you basketball freaks, I know you' re out there somewhere, but that's just not good enough. This is just to in form you that there is such a thing asIC Basketball Club, and if you didn't know, it's due to poor advertising and general apathy of its current members( which is why we need YOU). We had our first meeting on Tuesday7 October in which we decided on, and organised such ritual issues as training sessions,\netc.\nIf you are interested in joining( men and women a like), contact Tony Ka k as( Maths PG) or Mike A in s lie( Physics3). Alternatively, keep your eyes glued to FELIX sports columns for more details. Mike Ainslie\nPhysics3 Karate\nTHE Karate Club will behaving work outs on Monday evenings between7:309:30 pm and Wednesday afternoon between1:00 pm and3:00 pm in the Union Gym. H Basi\nCaptain Football\nMANY THANKS to all the people who turned up for the trials. We have about120 people who indicated they wished to play for the club and it is impossible to sort out reasonable sides after just two trials.\nWe would ask you to bear with us over the next lew weeks until the sides settle down, so keep your eye on the club noticeboard, outside the Union Bar. If you have n't at present been selected for a team and want to play could you add your name to the list\nprovided. If you are selected could you make sure you either tick or cross against your name( with an explanation if necessary) to indicate your intention to turn up, by12:30 pm, on the day before the match. There is a referees course starting on October21 at UL U, two hours a night for seven weeks with a qualifying exam at the end. Anyone who is interested in going on it please see me or Melvin Collins in the Union Office any lunchtime.

    "content": "Dear Sir\nThankyou for printing our article in Fresher s' F'ELIX about the successful IC Water Polo Club tour during the summer vacation. But, was it really necessary to change the original title of our report from' Water Polo Club Triumph In Dorset' to\n' Water Polo Club Piss OverAll Opposition'? Tours\nDave Roberts Dear Sir\nFor the third year in succession\nwe have been reminded, by the\nEditor, that FELIX is not intended as a vehicle for distributing the\nviews of TC Union. Our experiences from reading the last two issues ol\nthis publication strengthen this claim but seem, however, to suggest that it is being used to\npromote the views of one person: namely yourself.\nWe understand that the Editor of any publication has total responsibility for its contents, but\ndoes that mean that your comments on other people's views, and more especially on the ' Readers' Letters' published in last week's FELIX have to be included so that you get your' final word' one very matter. We plead ignorance of the\nFELIX constitution, but we must expect that this includes some assurance on the right of' free speech' without risk of being insulted by the Editor simply because the views being expressed are contrary to his own or, indeed, critical of him. Perhaps if\nyou were not to dismiss youri critics out of hand there would be\nmore chance of getting the respect\nof your readership. Tours faithfully\nHu wB ayn ham, Physics3 Andreas Kr idiot is, Che mEng3 Michael Bu hagia r, Physics3 Dear Steve\nJust a small personal attack: I think you' re one of the most puerile and bigoted editors I 've\ncome across in my short and sheltered existance. You' re entitled to your own views( there, isn't that generous of me) but please,\nput your blasted editorial comments where they belong \u2014 in the editorial( or dustbin if necessary). Love, cuddles, kisses and the odd\nstranglehold,\nKir s ren Pratt Maths3 Dear Sieve\nI read your anti apartheid bit\nSeptember291980). You seem to\nforget that FELIX is funded by the students.\nThese students have a right to\nair their views and express objections on certain in human policies.\nQuoting some 'freaks' as banking with Barclays, I imagine does not\nentitle you to encourage apartheid. Surely in the era of cuts in public expenditure, money means a lot\nbut for God's sake why sell your conscience in order to attract funds?\nTours sincerely\nSteve Nwa buz or Dept of Ci vEng SirI read with interest into day's FELIX that College will receive about \u00a3 1 . 1 m from the mining of H arlington. Your reporter, Tim Hilly er, noted that several important decisions have already been made about how this money should be\nspent. If it is not too late I would suggest that it ought to be spent\nfirstly on improving the Sports Centre. Facilities for many types\nof indoor sport that are regarded as standard in most Colleges and Universities are at present not readily available to the IC student. Secondly a Must fund ought to\nbe set up to administer an agreed number of scholarships to students from developing countries. Last session ICU and its members deplored the increased fees for foreign students. It was agreed then that more( of other people's) money had to be made available to encourage more foreign students to study here. Let us show how truly enlightened we are and make some of our money available. Anything left in the kitty should be invested in capital equipment to help the arts societies\nat IC. It is not, I hope, that I underestimate the accommodation problems. It is just I think that they can be overcome without large amounts of capital being required. This may not be said about the problems in the other areas I have touched on. In anticipation, thankyou for\nyour( many I fear) column inches( or is it centimetres now?). Tours faithfully\nMark Clegg Me chEng3 Dear Editor\nWe were interested to read the\nsuggestions of J Passmore as to the\nfuture role of the PG Group. These were, either disbanding the\ngroup( though he gives no reason why the College should receive advantage by this action) or forming a comparable undergraduate group to have the equivalent status with regard to\nthe welfare of undergraduates. The idea behind the second suggestion( if we examine the present arrangements; is simply to\nredistribute the resources of the\nUnion according to which scheme each group would benefit indirect proportion to its membership. No doubt J Passmore would be relieved of many burdensome administrative duties if such a radical vision could be realised, but nevertheless, we feel that he should just concentrate on effecting modest increases in the PG Group grant for the present.\n1 ours sincerely\nPG Group Committee Dear Sir\nI have at last decided to put pen to paper about a subject which has both annoyed me and destroyed my respect for UG Ms.I don't want to make a stand on individual incidents but of the\nway in which the meetings are used. Iam growing more and more to feel that in fact we have arrive data showpiece for personal/ group grievances at the\n' numerous injustices' within society, as opposed to a decision making body. I will step down and say that some decisions of reasonable importance have been made in the last lew years but precious few. All too often, I have seen\npeople unconcerned when putting forward a motion, as to whether what they are saying is going to\nchange anything but College opinion. Shouldn' tUG Ms be are alway of petitioning College to\nsupport some sphere, so that something is done and not merely said? Have our UG Ms become a centre for the propagation of a group's or individual's opinion? I would like to point out that bad attendances in UG Ms are probably to some degree a reflection on this approach to the platform for free speech provided. I think that if people felt they could really take an active part in decision making alter open discussion instead of' very little done' after prolonged and heated discussion, we might get somewhere. Having said that, I don't want to rule out anyone' s right( especially mine) to express their views. I know my hope is both naive and idealistic (i.e. will never happen) but Iam convinced that a much better way of settling these issues is\nto call a debate, or write to FELIX. Michael Brown Maths3 Dear Steve\nI would like to, through your newspaper, explain why I called quorum at the first U GM of term. The fact that the meeting was in quo rate is not disputed, there was not a count of those present, though some reports suggest as\nfew as 1 6 0 were present. The Exec began in full knowledge of this; I decided to with old my Point of Order till all the officers\nhad reported. These reports are necessary lor the day to day running of the College Union. However, when considering any motions it\nis crucial that the legislature is\nrepresentative since a motion is\nlikely to have far reaching consequences. I would never consider the 160 or so present likely to\nvoice the same opinions as those\nrepresentative ol4,500, therefore I called quorum. There were those present who would have carried on, had I not called quorum, despite the fact\nthat any decision would have been against the spirit of the ICU constitution and arguably the letter. Their resultant decision would not have been less wrong because quo racy had not been challenged. In a democracy the individual surrenders some of his liberty to\nelected representatives in return for civil guarantees. These must be obeyed on both sides. If the Union does not enforce its own rules over quo racy it loses respect. It can even be argued that at aUG M of less than300, where the quo racy is not challenged, it is the\nduty of the individual to ignore its\nmotions. When I called quorum I was using my right to enforce the Union's own rules on the Union. For Phil Cole, a liberal, to tacitly disregard the quorum is ideologically illiberal, he supported the\npower of the Exec to disobey its\nown rules. If one suggests that a quorum is an integral part of democracy then to accept in quo rey is to accept undemocracy. A truly representative executive must change to meet the changing aspirations of its membership. At ICI cannot say what they are, but it is desperate that over94% of students chose to stay away( which they must do if there is\nadequate publicity), is it not the\nfault of the body itself? Is it\narguing itself into irrelevancy? To simply change the quorum( lower it, one supposes) is a myopic action, we must find out why this\n9 4 % of students are staying away. This must be a job lor P WP with its high proportion of fresher s( one\nhopes). It is my contention that a Union member must act by the\nletter and spirit of the rules he\nhimself votes for. Simply to ignore quo racy means that it is easier for\nactivists to take control and complete the alienation of the mass of students. One then has no argument if the activists begin to\nignore the rules since one would have torn down the compromise of democracy. Page 2 Friday, October 10, 1980\n\n"

    "content": "Last Friday, I was sent a letter by the Union\nExecutive, claiming certain factual inaccuracies\nin last week's FELIX. Before I continue, here is\nthe letter:\nDear Sir,\nJust a wee note to clear up a few factual\ninaccuracies in your FELIX of October 3, 1980.\n1. Exec News was not distributed in a frenzy at\nthe Rector's Reception. The copies were placed in\neach department as per usual.\n2. A meeting is not in quo rate until the quorum\nis challenged and a quorum call cannot be\nwithdrawn.\n3. The Union Bar remained open until 5:00pm at Freshers' Fair.\n4. Miss Ruth Hildebrand's jacket was stolen\nfrom the Guilds Reception held in the Union\nConcert Hail, not from the proceedings in the\nGreat Hall.\n5. The two gentlemen who inspected the\ntrophy cabinet and the Rape Alarm system around\nthe Union Office were from the firm who are to\ninstall further alarms. The degree of security was\ndecided at the beginning of August when it was\nagreed to install an alarm on the trophy cabinet at a cost of \u00a3101, and two additional rape alarms in the\nUnion Office at a cost of \u00a3170.\n6. The Freshers' UGM, October 7, 1976 was\nclosed due to in quo racy at 2:30pm. The Freshers'\nU GM, October 5, 1978, was closed due to\nin quo racy at 2:20pm.7. Bill Robertson has not yet received his\nHonorary Life Membership of IC Union as he was\nunable to attend the Freshers' UGM, but the\npresentation is scheduled for the UGM October\n28, 1980.\nWe could go on, but that's enough for the time\nbeing.\nWe fee\"l it will be a great pity if this trend is\nallowed to continue as there is a great risk that the\nLetters Page will be reduced to corrections of\nmistakes made in the previous week's issue.\nLove\nMichael John\nRachel Jane\nElizabeth Agnes\nthemselves as an efficient, vibrant Exec, as I received a further two mysterious phone calls\nfrom Mr Passmore (Irishman) urging me to\nprint their letter.\nMr Passmore (Irishman) then picked fault\nwith the headline 'Freshers' U GM Inquorate'\nclaiming there is no such word as in quo rate. Of\ncourse, we were merely quoting Mr Passmore\n(Irishman) at the U GM \u2014 see (2) of the Exec's letter, and the part of Passmore's Preversions\nwhere he uses the word 'quo rate'. What about the actual letter? 1-4 are mere\n, trivial crap intended to fill out the letter. As for\n(5), I would ask why Rae Snee did not inform\nme of these details when I asked her at the end\nof August for the PG Issue. Also, I distinctly\nremember Mr Passmore negotiating a shady\ndeal (cash in hand) with a security guard who\nknew the right people for 'very cheap' alarm\nsystems. Whatever came of that John, I don't see you reporting it in your articles each week.\nSlapped wrists all round!\nWhat about (6)? Here I fall down, what I had\nmeant to write was that this is the first Freshers'\nU GM for five years to be in quo rate RIGHT\nFROM THE VERY BEGINNING AT1:00p m.I notice the quoted UGMs had a good one and a half hours of business discussed. And (7) \u2014\ntrivial pooh.\nI fear that if the trend of spending many\nworking hours devising methods of getting at\nthe Editor of FELIX is not averted then the\npresent nine to five Exec will degenerate into a 'What time does the bar open Exec'.\nAs for Mr Passmore, may I advise him that his\nyear as President will be judged on the amount\nof policy passed at UGMs and the improvements in College life made, NOT on how many\ntimes he is seen arse holed in the Union Bar.\nTheTrish President\nAn apology\nI would wish to retract all of the above\nstatements; after they were pasted down I realised that I had been a little harsh on the\nExec. So, John, Rae and Liz, please consider all\nof the above well and truly retracted.\nThe Exec must be very proud of their letter\nas I have heard nothing else since. Rae Snee\ninformed IC Radio of the letter and it became a major news item. Midweek, the Exec got the\nimpression that I wasn't going to print their\nmissive and they descended on me in force to\nattempt to grill me about it.\n1\nI must have not satisfied their desire for\npublicity for their cause, i.e. that portraying\nThanks to\nAll those people who helped this week, I won't list you as I don't know some of your names.\nPlease come to the staff meeting at 1:00pm today and introduce yourself in a more relaxed\natmosphere. And don't forget the Phoenix\nmeeting on Tuesday at 7:00pm in Stans.\ncontinued from front page\nIC Mosque\nfundamental questions about the very safety\nof the mosque, and of the equipment of\nIC Radio. It is startling that Dave Fuller was\nonly informed of the decision to site\na mosque at 9 Princes Gardens last\nThursday after the decision was finalised.\nU is indeed woeful that the Estates Office\nsaw fit to go ahead without even cursory\nconsultation. Though it is clear that Islam\nSoc have a case for a mosque, is this the\nbest site available? Unfortunately due to\nthe non-appearance of Islam Soc in the\nUnion Handbook or its officers in the Union\nDirectory, FELIX has been unable to discuss\nwith them their point of view.\ncontinued from front page\nTrophies\ncrime desk on our behalf who informed him\nthat according to the crime book, the\nfingerprint search had drawn negative\nresults.

    "content": "By B.B. Wolff eU iom te tib\\* ib tea p tmb REMEMBER the story about the rotten food\nin Southside in the Freshers' FELIX?\nWell, authoritative sources tell us that as\nj soon as Mr Mooney saw FELIX he rushed\ninto the kitchens with Mr Parsons (Assistant\nRefectory Manager) and proceeded to grill\n(or reheat, maybe) all of the staff.\nThe cook freeze abuse is common knowledge in the kitchens and Mr Mooney\nwas very annoyed that it had been leaked to\nthe press. We would dare to suggest that\ninstead of wasting his time attempting to\ncover up his failings he diverted his attention\nto doing a better job. 'Nuff said?\nIllegal Rm Wm SO MUCH for all the fuss about Steve\nMarshall's rag mag being illegal last year\nbecause it didn't have the printer's name\non it. Even Big Brian made detrimental\ncomments about it (we all know it was just\na very convenient excuse to stop its sale \u2014\nnice try, Bri!). I shudder to think what\nCollege would do if they even suspected that\nany of those rag mags were ever sold\nafterwards without the printer's imprint.\nSo public-spirited was I, that I bought out\nRag's entire supply at Fresher's Fair\n(lOp each) to stop them falling into the\nwrong hands. These illegal items are now\nbeing sold for personal and private gain\nat \u00a35 each.\nPS Congrats are now in order to Dave\nJago for keeping up the tradition of\nproducing excellent rag mags. I like it\na lot and it's nice to see the printer's imprint\nthis year (you can't miss it). I'm not terribly\nconversant with the Printer's Imprint Act,\n196T, so I wouldn't know whether it needed\nthe publisher's name or not.\nTHE Oily Dowson Memorial Prize for\nmisleading headlines was today presented to\nMr S Goulder, FELIX news editor. Mr SJ Marshall, current holder of the title, was\n, visibly moved by this shock defeat but\nconfidentially stated that he would be back\non form soon.\nIT'S NICE to see that the Union bog lights\nhave at long last been fixed.\nSo, when is Rachel Jane going to realise\nthat us masculine types also need such\nrequisites as soap, and bog paper? Locks\nand handles on the doors would be nice too.\nLiz Lindsay has been heard to comment\nthat she thinks that the paper in the ladies is\nfar too hard. Woopee! But what about us\nblok es, long finger-nails play havoc with our\npiles, you know!\nWhile we're on the bog: when was the last\ntime Rachel Jane checked the Durex\nmachine? I would have thought someone\nwould have told her that it needed filling by\nnow.\nAkc \u00a3 Mm\nI MUST be feeling particularly anal today.\nI 've been absorbed by the new KimberlyClark bog paper all this week. Most of the\nhalls have sprouted little plastic dispensers of\nsingle sheet paper. Did you know, and not a lot of people know this, but the equivalent\namount of paper is TWICE as expensive as\nthe old stuff. At first, I was astounded that\nCollege should want to double their already\nmassive toilet paper bills, but after careful\nexperimentation in the field (where do you\nthink I wrote this article?) I think they may\nnot be as daft as everybody thinks.\nWhile I usually pull about eight sheets off a roll to make a four sheet wiper, I find it\nawfully time consuming to pull out the\nequivalent from these dastardly dispensers.\nAnd I have discovered that I only need a couple of sheets for the average bomb load\n\u2014 thus cutting down wastage and U bend\nblockage. V Good.\nI also did a little research amongst some of\nthe FELIX staff members. Dave Jago tells me\nhe only uses one sheet at a time any wav and\nthinks College are wasting money. However,\nMark Smith claims to need a16 sheet wiper\ni as a minimum. Even this is no match for\nwhat he cutely terms his 'flock of sparrows'\nafter a Star of India Curry.\nWhy don't YOU write to the Editor and\ntell him what you think of the new bog\npaper.'\nL INSTEAD basement is currently being\ntidied up. It is used as a trunk and baggage\nstore but tends to be abused by ex-students\nwho return fifteen years later expecting to\nfind their trunks still intact.\nOne such trunk was discovered which\nbelonged to an Iranian ex-Mech Eng student.\nAfter forcing the lock an interesting item was\nnoticed amongst the clothes, books and\nsoldering irons \u2014 a gold-plated vibrator!\nPuzzle Corner\nBy Scaramouche\nThere are very few students of logic at Primelia College;\nnot surprising, really, considering their professor's sense of humour.\nWhen exam results were announced last term, for instance, he mixed\nup the cards in his secretary's address file, so all six final year students\nreceived a letter giving the results of one of the others. Predictably, all\nsix were waiting outside his office when he arrived the following\nmorning.\n\"Well work them out!\" beamed the professor. \"After all, you know\nwe awarded one first, two seconds, and three thirds. And surely you\nguessed that Bumble did better then Drudge, and Clumsy didn't do as\nwell as Amble.\"\n\"I now know everyone's results,\" announced Fumble.\n\"From that, I can deduce them all, too,\" said Clumsy.\n\"Now I know them all,\" put in Bumble.\n\"Me too,\"groused Amble. \"I thought I'd done better than that.\"\n1\nThe six of them then set off for the Queen's Legs to celebrate,\nleaving the professor's secretary working how to put the correct\nnames to the addresses in her file. Can you help her?\nSolutions please, with comments and criticisms, to me c/o FELIX\nOffice by 12:00noon on Tuesday, October 14.\nIC UNION\nFRESHERS' CONCERT\n+ support TOMORROW\n7:30pm CONCERT HALL\nONLY\n\u00a32\nPage 10 FELIX, October 10, 1980\n\n"

    "content": "By J. Passmore\nWELL DONE, you got through\nthe first week as well. My first\nduty this week is to explain the\nwhole structure relating to\nUG Ms, representation, etc. So . .\nUGMs\nIC Union General Meetings are\nheld about once a month. They\ndiscuss matters which have arisen in the intervening period\nand decide what should be done,\ni.e. they instruct myself and the\nother officers what to do. This\ncan be anything from representation within College to matters\nexternal (normally those which\naffect us).\nUG Ms are held either on Tuesday or Thursday lunchtimes\n(1:30pm to 2:30pm) so nobody\nwill miss lectures. They are well\nadvertised beforehand. A thing\ncalled Exec Neius is produced\nthree to four days before the\nmeeting and it contains Officers'\nreports and motions which are to\nbe discussed.\nWhat happens at a UGM?\nWell, the minutes of the last\nmeeting are distributed at the\nmeeting and any matters arising\nare dealt with. Then the Officers\npresent their reports, and everyone\nasks questions about what we\nhave done. Then the juicy bit,\nmotions, where the Union formulates policy to guide the Exec in\nmaking their decisions. The Union policy document is kept\nin the Union Office and contains\npolicy past back beyond 1968.\nAnyone can propose any motion\nat aUG M. Normally motions\nconsist of noting various facts;\nbelieving several things, and instructing people to do things.\nMotions are proposed and speeches are made, then the\nmotions may be amended or\nopposed or both. An amendment\nadds some extra bits and/ or takes away some bits and is\nproposed in a similar fashion to\nthe main motion, it can then be\nopposed. If necessary, another\nround of speeches may be held\nand after discussion a vote is\ntaken. The main motion can also\nbe opposed and there can also\nbe more speeches, finally leading\nto a vote. The whole process is\ncomplicated but it all follows the\nsame pattern. The only way you\ncan really find out is to go, and\nwhen there, if you do not under-stand, shout and scream at the\npeople at the front until they tell\nyou.\nFor meetings to remain quo rate300 people are required. That\ndoes not mean that just 300\nshould turn up. If Union meetings\nare to be effective lots more are\nneeded.\nAlso many people think that\nstudent unions are a crowd of\npoliticos. Well, we are not in\nNUS and believe in representing\nour own students; just look at\nthe agenda, basically a motion to\nrestrict a discussion on a subject\nto once a term, a motion on\nlecture training (enough said) and\na motion on overseas students.\nThe next meeting is TUESDAY, OCTOBER28 at 1:00pm in the\nGreat Hall.\nTimetables\nRemember that no lectures should be timetabled for Wednesday afternoons or the 1:30-2:30\nslot on Tuesdays and Thursdays\n(except for the last term). Any\ncomplaints regarding this \u2014 see\neither your Dep Rep or myself.\nYou should know by now who\nyour Dep Rep is and should elect\nAcademic and Social reps this\nweek.\nPapers\nPapers are up in the Lower Lounge for a multitude of posts,\nmost of which no one will know\nanything about. To explain:\nThe External Affairs Officer\ndeals with UL U, grants, overseas\nstudents, libraries and various\nother things. His/her committee\nhelps the officer.\nThe Permanent Working Party\nworks on matters referred to\nthem by Council, normally of an\ninternal nature, e.g. refectories.\nUL U Student Representative\nCouncil delegates represent ICU within the University on many\nacademic and university matters.\nUnion Finance Committee\ndeals with Union finance (which is\napproximately \u00a3189.00).\nAcademic Affairs Committee\ndeals with lecturer training, tutorials, lab work, etc.\nTiddlywinks was absolutely\nexcellent. Well done all who went, I hope you keep it up.\nAll for now. Hie! Try Bluebell\non 2488, wonderful!\nJohn Passmore\nPresident\nMatters Raised\nWELL I hope you're all settled in\nby now, despite the hectic first\nweek. If you didn't come to\nFreshers' Fair then ya, boo and\nsucks because you missed all the\nclubs. However, you can always\nget names of club captains, etc,\nfrom Annie in the Union Office,\nso you can still join up. I was\nvery pleased with the way the\nFair went, and I must thank Rich\nArcher, Dave Britton and Annie,\nwho were the only ones who\nstayed till the end to clear up.\nAnd now the rest of this weeks\nTrophy Lead\nDespite what was said in the\nFreshers' FELIX, the police have\nbeen making progress on the\nstolen trophies. They have identified a suspect, who left\nmany fingerprints on the broken\nwindow and the cabinet itself,\nand they are at present tracing\nhim so that he can \"help them\nwith their enquiries\".\nJCR Furniture\nMost of the furniture has now\ncome back, completely re-up-holstered and looking very nice\nindeed. As this was achieved at a cost of over \u00a34,000 to the Union,\nwe would like to see it staying\nnice. Please, please, PLEASE spare a little thought, and treat it\nwith respect, after all, its your\nmoney, which could have been\nspent in far better ways. Also I'd like to give an official warning: if\nanyone is caught abusing the\nfurniture they will be severely\ndisciplined and made to pay the\ncost of making good any damage.\nFinance\nThe Union Finance Committee\nMajor Claims meeting will be on\nTuesday, November 4, and all\nclaims must be in to me one week\nbeforehand, i.e. by Tuesday, October 28. So all you clubs and\nsocieties had better start thinking\nabout what you need and finding\nsome very good reasons why you\nneed it!\nThat's all for this week, so bye\nfor now.\nRae\nNOTICES Lecture\n6:O0pm\nMonday, October 13\nMining Lecture Theatre (L31)\nProf CT Shaw\n'The History of Mining \u2014 its\nValue to Mining Today'.\nService Till\nThe College bank has asked us to\npoint out that balance enquiries are\nonly available from the service till\ngenerally between 9:00am and\n5:00pm on weekdays only.\nRCS Nite Out\nThere will be a RCS Nite Out to see\nthe Secret Policeman's Ball on\nWednesday, October 15.

This traditionally is a mass wink down Oxford Street with Mines taking the middle of the road; Guilds to their left and RCS to their right. outside, both moving anticlockwise RCS in the middle performed a clockwise motion. Also surprised were those win kers told to be \u2022 there at 1 : 0 0 pm. The final act of the event was a well earned adjournment to the Cockney Pride.

Guilds amassed \u00a3 4 5 8 , top collectors being, Martin Bellamy with Anthony Davis of CCD with \u00a3 3 0 . 5 1 . Mines collected \u00a3 2 9 0 .\nRing-a Ring-a Roses at Eros\nThe Arab/IC Radio\nConflict\nIC RADIO may have an unlikely neighbour at its technical\nstudio at 10 Princes Gardens; the basement of no 9 is to\nbecome a mosque to be used by Islam Soc. The controversy\nsurrounds the application of GLC Fire Regulations which\nstipulate that a second escape route be available.\nThe estates department has decided that the best way to\ncomply with these regulations is to put a door in the wall that\nwill divide the mosque from the studio so escape will be\nthrough the studio.\nHowever, due to the expensive equipment( \u00a3 4 , 0 0 0 plus) the studio is always kept locked when not in use. Thus this route of escape could easily become a trap. The creation of a point of access into the studio that cannot be locked puts at risk the IC Radio equipment to any thief who can get into the\nbasement mosque. The estates department are being pressed to strengthen the\nentrance to the mosque, but any religious building usually encourages free access. All of this\ncould be a headache lor the company that insures IC Radio and could lead to an increase in the\npremiums. In addition, there are also logistical problems; as fate would have it the wall in question supports most of the bench space and synthesis er. To make room lor the door and its opening space would result in the loss of about70% of the work area. When interviewed, Dave Fuller of IC Radio was obviously not pleased and said at best he could only hope to delay the project for about a year. This all raises a number ol continued on back page\nSo with their forces marshalled and ready the signal was given and the tid d les were winked. Styles varied, beer gut hindering more mature students. However, even the fresher s soon gained the technique of simultaneously thrusting and rattling the Rag can. Many techniques were used to\nattempt to avoid contributing but there was little escape even for the\nmost ardent avoid er. One rather lavishly embellished, but shops oiled femme fatale was heard saying that she was also looking for a few pennies herself. Undaunted, another willing helper approached, to whom she commented that she too was a pro. The spirit of the affair was echoed by a lady who fulfilled Wilde' s comment that:\" the tragedy of Old Age is that not\none is Old, but that one is\nyoung\". At the age of60, she winked for a while in classic style, till whisked, with compassion less efficiency, by her daughter to more' fitting' pursuits. The last thing anyone considered was legality until confronted by officers of Her Majesty' s Metropolitan Constabulary. Luckily, they either didn't find\nout, or mind, the fact that the\nevent had not been licensed. Normally, rules are bent by using house to house collection licenses\nas very few street collections are allowed each year. However, apart from a few left over from last year in Mines possession, most collectors could not even produce this license if challenged due to an oversight by Rag Chairman, Ian Hodgson. Despite this, the motley soon wound their way to Eros at which, to the surprise of the uninitiated onlooker, a' Ring a Ring a Roses' was performed at\n1 2 : 1 0 pm. Mines formed the innermost circle with Guilds on the\nConfusion\nreigns in\ntrophy case\nRAE S NEE has informed us that\nthe CID visited the Union Office on Monday to return the Exec and staffs fingerprints taken when the trophies were stolen on July29. She adds that the officer in charge of the case told her that the likely culprit had been identified from his prints left on the trophy cabinet. They are, however, unable to trace him, but believe he is on the continent. John Passmore tells us that the person is the same one as initially suspected by the College security. And now the confusion begins! FELIX telephoned Mr Burroughs in College security who told us\nthat they had heard nothing from the police. He phoned up the continued on back page\nNo. 562 Friday, October 10,1980 Free!\n\n"

    "content": "I chose what I still consider to\nhave been the right course, however unpopular it may have been. Tours sincerely\nStephen Gould er Bio chem2 Dear Steve\nOr may I call you Mr Marshall? I would like to register my annoyance at your frontpage article entitled' Esoteric Ineptitude'( incidentally, just what is that supposed to mean?). Your misquotation and/ or writer's license \u2014\ntapping my nose, indeed! \u2014 could be forgiven. However, the most disturbing part of the article, I find, is the last line, which says \" Who knows, or indeed cares?\". Since you area chemistry graduate and therefore an ex RCS student, I lind it worrying that you should treat in such a flippant manner the loss, if only temporary, of the three handled pot which traditionally plays a large part in the life of the\nRoyal College Science. You are, I believe, a traditionalist, to judge from the manner in which you talk about FELIX. Why, then, dismiss so lightly the traditions of your own constituent college? I note that you made no comment after Ruth' s appeal for the return of the Guilds VP' s jacket. Does this not constitute another example of' Esoteric Ineptitude'? I would also like to\nsupport Ruth' s appeal. A llCC U regalia is inviolate and anyone stupid enough to walk off with coats\nor pots will find themselves on the\npolice's wanted list very quickly. Furthermore, I had thought you were concerned with printing facts\nin news items, and yet the final two sentences being\" it is understood\" and\" it is suspected\". This sort of writing surely belongs in the BB Wolff e column and not on the front\npage. Paul Johnson Dear Steve\nCan the Exec explain, through the pages of FELIX, why fresher s have been given the impression that the old TV Lounge next to the\nSnooker Room is the official meeting place of I CW A as was implied by the posters, etc. around College. As far as we are concerned I CW A have a Lounge on the li rst floor of the Union Building next to the Union Office which has for many years served the purpose quite adequately. Apart from the inconvenience caused to both I CW A and the Snooker Club, this Lounge is the\nonly room available lor the long awaited third table for the Snooker Club. This table is provisionally budgeted for and will improve the\nalready excellent facilities offered\nby the Club( the largest in the\nCollege). I ask the Exec then, why have they taken this decision without the consultation of either the clubs concerned or the student body as a whole. President, Snooker Club For and on behalf of its members. Bilston Band romp\nhome in Sherfield\nTHE WELL kept secret of the\nweek was the hosting of part of the Brass Band National Championship at I Cover the most of last Saturday. By mid morning, the event was well underway with the twenty competing bands in the Division2 contest attempting to blast the others into oblivion. The final selection was the Bil st on Colliery Band from Newton Grange near Edinburgh. The trophy was taken on behalf of the band by its conductor Nigel Bod dice. Iraqis besiege\nEmbassy\nHEATED demonstrations took place on Sunday outside the Iraqi Embassy in Queen's Gate opposite the Huxley Building. BBCTV relayed pictures of the\nscuffles nationwide which peaked with the arrest of what appeared to be two Iraqi students. The affair echoed the current Gulf War between the Iraqis and Iranians. The protesters consisted of two rival demonstrations. One from the Iraqi camp showing solidarity with the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, whose portrait was commonly displayed, asserting him to be championing the Arab cause in the Persian Gulf. The opposing group were obvious from the Koh mein i posters and pro Iran slogans.\nWhen the predictable scuffles\nbroke out the ample police presence moved in to keep the peace. They succeeded in keeping the two camps apart but in doing so had to arrest some demonstrating Iraqis. A further demonstration took place on Wednesday morning. This one was a little more unusual in that the Islamic Association of Iraqi Students were demonstrating in sympathy with the Ayatollah\ncalling the controlling Ba'a this ts fascists.\nShadow of Death\nhangs over ICWA\nTHE THREATENED Palace coup at Tuesday afternoon' sIC WA meeting failed to materialise as the meeting did not meet quorum. The move to unseat the present President had widespread support among the Executive. The reasons were quite plain; the President(S and raO' Sullivan) had shown no interest in I CW A and had' chosen not to attend the fresher s' introduction. This state of affairs arose last\nyear because of the then Hon Sec,' RogerS totes bury' s animosity towards I CW A. He foisted Sandra O' Sullivan upon them to make sure that I CW A was not active this year. Members that we spoke to felt quite strongly that he should have had the courage to\ntake the issue to the U GM. They also feel that the President ought to either change her policy or do the only right thing and resign. In addition to this members are most concerned over the lack of\nconsultation over the movement of the I CW A Lounge. The new room on the third floor is both inconvenient to I CW A members and Snooker Club members. Miss Anne Edmunds was quoted as\nsaying it's like having a meeting at South Ken tube station. Waitrose Trolleys\nPurge\nTHE MANAGER ESS of Wait ros c visited IC last Friday and with the help of Mr Burroughs of College security managed to collect about a dozen trolleys. This doubles the existing number of Wait rose trolleys at the store.\nThe Manager ess has told FELIX that while she appreciates our business, she does wish that we wouldn't keep nicking their trollies. She appealed for any remaining trollies to be turned in to College security. As Wait rose is a very good friend of IC in that it feeds us and supports our Rag, FELIX suggests\nthat students cast their eyes towards less generous supermarkets.( Incidentally, have you seen the\ntrolley in Wait rose with' Central Stores' scratched on the handle? \u2014 Ed) Poster Fines\nTHE UNION has made it clear that any club or society that leaves promotional posters up for\nmore than two days after the event will be liable to fines. These fines, as yet undisclosed by the Exec, are likely to be donated to\nWU S. Several club chairmen have expressed their concern over ICU and CC U's publicity staying up long after the events are ended. They hope that an example will be set.\nBUSF Victory\nOVER the summer vacation, two IC students represented London University at the BUS F Athletics Championships at Nottingham. Beth Marcus unfortunately performed below her best and so just missed finishing in the top three in the javelin, while Mike Weiner won the bronze medal in the hammer but was disappointed having finished second last year. Buttery smashes\nattendance records!\nTHE BUTTERY saw tremendous queues on Tuesday as it was seen\nfit to have only one cashier on duty. However, most people didn't seem to mind \u2014 as they had consumed most of their meal in the queue before arriving to\npay for the odd Mars Bar, etc.\nMicroscopes stolen\nA FURTHER breakin at Imperial College occurred last Wednesday(2 nd October) evening at the Old Chemistry building. The room concerned, number53, is used by second year bacteriology students and around forty expensive light microscopes were in the room. The thief took some of the eyepiece lenses and other pieces of equipment worth up to \u00a3 9 0 0 .\nPolice were called in and looked at a window suspected of being the access point. Dr Carlile, a senior member of the Biochemistry department has said that he was certain that the crime was committed by a person with no connection with the College. Stan's Hot Bread Kitchen\nTHE CLOISTERED colonnades of the new Stan's Bar( \u00a3 1 7 , 0 0 0\nworth) are to be provided with music piped from IC Radio. The two alcoves nearest the toilets are at present having speakers installed. The third alcove is to be left completely IC Radio free. Blues Band Blues\nTHE BLUES BAND concert in\nthe Great Hall on Monday was apparently a great success, with about750 people turning up( a capacity crowd). Unfortunately it\nwas marred by the attitude of the\nCollege authorities. The band required a piano of reasonable quality and there was already one available in the Hall; the powers that be( Prof Brown of the Ci vEng department) were however, unwilling to allow a' rowdy' pop group to use it. ENTS tried to\nborrow a piano from other sources\nin and around the College and eventually managed to hire one at\nvery short notice for \u00a3 1 1 5 . They then had to have a piano tuner in\nto tune it at a further cost of \u00a3 5 0 .\nOn top of this, ENTS had to\npay lighting costs; although this\nwas organised by Dram soc, the\ncost of equipment hire pushed the\nlighting bill up to \u00a3 1 5 0 .\nNot surprisingly when the two bands had been paid, it was found that the concert had made a loss of about \u00a3 5 0 . This seems a shame when the concert was such a success.\nFELIX, October 10, 1980 ' Page 3\n\n"

A Kangela from over a hundred people in the tunnel\nserved to terror is e all the tourists\nin the vicinity, so the rest of the\nevening was (fairly) peaceful.\nThe real blockbuster of the\nweek took place on Saturday.\nAbout 170 intrepid RCS persons\nturned out to tid dle and wink\ndown Oxford Street. Despite\nbeing outnumbered by Guilds,\nRCS pissed all over them by\ncollecting around \u00a3940 with a few\ncans still outstanding. Top collector of the day was Andy\nNorth of Physics 1 with \u00a342.\nHowever, congratulations to\neveryone who came along, you're\nall stars as far as I'm concerned.\nThe next Rag stunt will be this\nSaturday and is a circus outside\nHarrods. Clowns and other\nperformers should meet in the\nRCSU Office at 10:00am. The bar night on Sunday was\na good old barnstorm er to finish\noff the week on a high note and\ntotally wreck Archer's voice.\nForthcoming events include\nthe Freshers' Dinners. Maths is\non Friday and starts at 7:00pm for 7:30pm in the Ante-room,\nSherfield Building. There is also a party afterwards to which anyone\nwho has bought a ticket for any\nof the fresher s' dinners can go.\nMerely turn up at the JCR after\n10:00pm with your ticket receipt\nand you will be admitted.\nFinally, the RCS Union Office\nis open every lunchtime, so drop\nin to buy a slop shirt or just for a cup of coffee and a chat.\nSee you around.\nPJ\nFRESHERS' week is over and I have nearly had to retire with\nt alcoholic poisoning. The Fair was\na great success with a lot of\nregalia sold; this was followed by\nice-skating, where, despite many\nattempts, no injuries were incur-red. The rugby trials on Wednesday were well attended and in\nthe evening we had a great bar-nite. On Friday we had the best\nJCR party yet, and hopefully you\nall met some of the women from\nIF.\nTiddlywinks was a heap of fun,\nespecially down the centre of\nOxford St. In the end we collected\n\u00a3290 which means we collected\nmore money per head than the\nother CCUs. Finally on Saturday\nnight we held our annual pub-crawl, which although poorly\nattended, showed that the drinking\nspirit in Mines remains one of\nexcess.\nLater on this term we hope to\narrange a Rag collecting visit to\nWindsor.\nC&G NEXT MONDAY, October 13,\nGuilds are having a roller-skating\ntrip to the Covent Garden Rink.\nThe cost will be \u00a31.20 (group\nrate) plus \u00a31 deposit for skates,\nplus travel.

Be in Mech\nEng 220 at 12:45pm on the 14 to\ncast your all-important vote.\nOn Thursday, October 16, the\nfun really starts, with the first of\nthe Freshers' Dinners. These\noffer an excellent opportunity to\nmeet other members of your\ndepartment, have a really good\nthree-course meal and generally\nhave a great evening. There will\nbe sherry (or orange juice)\nserved in the Sherfield Anteroom at 7:00pm and the meal will\nstart at 7:30pm. After the dinner and speeches\nthere will be an opportunity to\nsocial is e with other members of\nyour department over coffee in\nthe JCR. A bar will also be open.\nThe cost of the dinner is \u00a34.50\nfor fresher s, \u00a36 for others. This\nprice includes sherry, wine, port\nand coffee. On the subject of\nport \u2014 a couple of 'rules': the\ndecanter must not be allowed to\ntouch the table; you must only\nhandle it with your left hand,\npassing it to your left; ladies\nmust not touch the decanter at\nall and it should be passed\nbehind them.\nOne other rule: anyone who\nleaves the room before the\nRoyal Toast must, on their\nreturn, drink one pint of beer\n(slightly salted), so make sure\nyou 'go' before the dinner.\nTickets are available from the\nGuilds Office or from your\ndepartmental reps.

    "content": "Clubs & Societies\nLiberal\nLAST WEDNESDAY, Richard Holme, President of the Liberal\nParty spoke to the fresher s* meeting of Imperial College Liberal Club. He stressed the\nfact that the Liberal Party had its\ngreatest opportunity in recent\nyears with a harsh and unpopular\nTory government faced by an\nineffective and bickering Labour\nopposition, and forecast a breakthrough in the next few years, as\nLiberal policies on human rights,\necology, industrial partnership,\nand 'power to the people', were\nseen as relevant to the situation\nof Britain and the world. During\navid discussion afterwards it was\nfelt that, whilst the Liberal party\nshould emphasise its role as the\nprogressive alternative, we\nshould be prepared to work with\nbroad based and single issue\ngroups to achieve our ends, and\nnot take the chauvinistic attitude\nof the other parties in si siting we\nwere the 'only way'.\nImperial College Liberal Club\nis part of the London Union of\nLiberal Students, which will be\nholding its first meeting at the\nCollegiate Threatre, University\nCollege, Gordon Street, W Cl at\n7:00pm on Wednesday, October\n15, and will be addressed by\nDavid Steel, MP speaking on the\n' Liberal alternative'.
