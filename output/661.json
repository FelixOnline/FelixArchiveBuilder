    "content": "Letters\nFremantle\nAllegations\nDear Sir\nAfter reading your article on\nthe 'resignation' of Andrew\nWalker, the Fremantle Hotel\nwarden. I feel that the story as\npresented has been engineered\nby Mr Walker to reflect his\nviews and not admit that any\nblame lies with him. 1 have firsthand knowledge of several\nincidents that helped him to\nlose what little respect he ever\nhad from the residents in the\nlast year.\non one occasion a resident of\nthe Fremantle wrote a letter to\nMichael Arthur complaining\nabout his abuse of his room\npass keys and called for\ndisciplinary action. Mr Arthur\nthen reprimanded Mr Walker\nand told him that an apology\nwas in order. Mr Walker then\nwrote an apology but unable to\nface the victim, used his passkey\nagain to enter her room, placing ,\nthe note and some flowers on\nher desk.\nLater in the year, myself and\nthe same resident had left a bag\ncontaining our cooking\nimplements in the kitchen. Her\nkeys were inside the bag. When\nwe returned the keys were\nmissing. After a protracted\nsearch we were informed by\nanother resident that Mr\nWalker had taken them from\nthe bag and had said that if we\nwanted the keys, we would have\nto get them from him. By this\ntime my girlfriend felt unable to\neven speak to Mr Walker and so\nI retrieved the keys from him.\nWhen I asked how he had come\nby them, he told me that\nsomeone had handed them to\nhim after finding them in the\nsink.\nIn addition to this, on several\noccasions Mr Walker made\ncomments concerning our\nrelationship freely to other\nresidents some of which I was\ninformed by those Who heard\nthem were quite offensive.\nIn my opinion, Mr Walker\nhas been sacked more because\nof these, and other, complaints\nagainst him, than because of\nany attempted whitewash by\nStudent Services.\nI am not writing this letter to\nspite Mr Walker, but hopefully\nto draw attention to the fact\nthat proper procedures for\nappointing wardens must be\nadhered to; even if this means\nleaving a warden ship empty i for a short while, and also to |\nPage 2\nspeak up for those who had a less than pleasant stay in what\nwas the friendliest place in\nwhich I have ever lived before\nthese incidents occurred.\nYours in concern (and anger)\nBrian Morrison\nElec Eng 2\nFremantle\nGripes\nDear Pallab\nI would like to draw your\nattention to several errors in\nyour reporting of the Fremantle\nHotel during the summer.\nFirst the condition of the\nFremantle was only of concern\nto me during the summer, and\nonly those parts that affected\nmy residents and staff. Second,\nI was asked to phone the fire\ninspector by Mr Andrew\nWalker so that the positioning\nof some new fire extinguishers\ncould be ascertained.\nSomething that none of my staff\nor myself are qualified to do.\nFinally, I was not given a stern dressing down from\nMichael Arthur (if I was- I wasn't there when it\nhappened!).\nFrom these above errors it\nmay lead the reader to question\nhow many more there are in\nyour articles.\nAndrew Barron\nEd's Apology. Sorry Andy. I would just like to make it clear\nthat you were not in the least bit\nconcerned about conditions in\nthe Fremantle or its residents and\nyou didn't call in the fire\ninspectors. We fully and\nunreservedly withdraw any\ncredit we gave you in the article.\nPS: You're bound to get your\nsub warden ship now.\nClean Slate\nDear Pallab\nThe front page article in\nFELIX of 25 November 1983\nentitled 'Estates Slated in Tiles\nFiasco' included errors of fact\nand drew false conclusions.\nThe Electrical Engineering\nBuilding was completed in 1961\nand like many buildings of that\ntime is suffering from an\ninherent construction al defect.\nIn 1977 it became evident that\nthe tiles cladding the building\nwere in danger of falling off and\na scaffold fan was erected to\nprotect passers by. The College\nsought professional and legal\nadvice with a view to obtaining\nrecompense from the architects\nand builders. Since then there\nhas been a complex, legal\nprocess during which the\nCollege has followed the\nguidance of its legal advisers.\nInitially it was necessary that\nthe evidence of failure be\nretained for inspection by the\narchitects and contractor.\nBy 1982 negotiations had\nreached a point where Counsel\nadvised that inspection from a scaffold was required, including\nthe removal of tiles and\nthereafter reinstatement could\nproceed. The College negotiated with the UGC for a loan to cover the large part of\nreinstatement cost.\nLegal cases of this kind are\ncomplex and the College would\nhave been negligent if it had\ntaken decisions on the remedial\nworks without following legal\nadvice. To those not aware of\nthe facts, the delay in correcting\nthe defects of the bul ding may\nwell have seemed inexplicable.\nYours sincerely\nDW Clark\nEstates Secretary\nHuman Rights\nWeek\nDear Pallab\nAs joint organiser of Human\nRights Week, I would like to\ncounter points forwarded by\nMr Jonathan Gerson in the last\nissue of FELIX.\nI personally sent invitations\nto all OSC and SCC societies\ninviting them to take part in the\nHuman Rights Week. If these\nsocieties choose to respond by\nexamining Human Rights\nabuses outside the Soviet\nUnion, they should be free to do\n[Wednesday, 14 December, 19831\nso without being accused of\nhijacking the week for political\npurposes.\nI made it clear in my letters\nthe societies that Human Rights\nWeek was to be used to\ncampaign for Human Rights,\nnot for propaganda, or merely\nto promote a College society.\nOf all the participating\nsocieties, only one expressed an\ninterest in abusing the spirit of\nHuman Rights Week by asking\nfor an extra table in the JCR\nsolely for the promotion of that\nsociety's literature and\nideology. Mr Gerson happens\nto be Chairman of that society.\nIt is beginning to become\nclear that Mr Gerson has some\nconfusion about what Human\nRights are, or that he is just\nplainly hypo crt ical. Perhaps it is understandable\nthat Mr Gerson, as a strident\ncapitalist and a Jew, sees the\nworst violations of Human\nRights as occur ing beh in J the\nIron Curtain.\nIf he were not so blinkered by\nhis own political ranting s, he\nmay realise that if he were a non-white in South Africa, or a Liberal in Chile, he would\nsuffer ab sues every bit as\nabhorrent as those occur ing in\nthe Soviet Union.\nDismissing Anti-American\nfeeling as 'trendy' is just as short\nsighted when considering the\nrole of the US in upholding and\nextolling repressive regimes\nthroughout Central and South\nAmerica, and indeed,\nthroughout the whole world.\nThe philosophy here is that\nthere cannot be an abuse of\nHuman Rights if done in the\nname of anti-'Communism'.\nIt is people who are prepared\nto put Human Rights second to\npolitical doctrines who betray\nthe world.\nFar be it from Mr Gerson's job to accuse others if not\ncaring about Human Rights at\nall.\nJohn Sattaur\nSCC Exec member\nAliens\nHave\nFeelings Too\nDear Pallab\nAs representatives of some of\nthe more puny insignificant\ndemi-dei fic mega-beings of the\nmultiverse, we find ourselves\nobliged to attract the attention\nof the populace to the heretical\nranting s and un-informed\ngobbled y gook spewed forth\n\u2022 \u2022 nH H FELIX\n\n"

Its\ncitizens were walking purposefully\ntowards the grimy slums which the\nBaron provided to accommodate them.\nTo protect themselves from the bitter\nwind that blew, they covered their faces\nwith thick scarves, woven with a vile\nmulti-coloured cloth designed to\nidentify them should they dare to step\noutside the kingdom unlawfully. Yet,\ndespite the adverse weather, it was with\nhope and optimism that they trudged\ndown Cheaps Gate and across to\nSouthside and the domain of the\nwicked witch Pristine; it was the end of\ntheir stay in that land of questionable\npleasure-for a short while, at least. It\nwas Christmas, a time for much\ncelebration, as the citizens began\nJohn Secretary locked away his plans from prying eyes and sneaked out\ninto the dark night, frequently glancing skywards wary of falling tiles.\n'I suppose I 'll have to spend most of\nChristmas on top of Lady Marigold's tree' moaned Arthur Michael.\npacking their belongings and prepared\nto flee Cheapskate and return to the\nwarmth and comfort af the homes of\ntheir youth. But while the citizens were\npacking, joyful at the prospect of their\nimminent departure, the season of\ngoodwill was failing to permeate several\nother parts of the kingdom.\nThe prospect of Christmas was not\none that appealed to Arthur Michael,\nthe good but not very helpful fairy.\n\"I suppose I 'll have to spend most of\nit on top of Lady Marigold's Christmas\ntree again,\" he moaned, fearful at the\nprospect of having a coloured lantern\non his head. \"And if those snivelling\nnephews are staying, I 'll simply refuse\nto do it,\" recalling how, previously, they\nhad spent much of the time throwing\nhot chestnuts at him in order to knock\nhim off. But the thought of the sharp\nend of the Baron's tree was not the only\nthing that preyed on Arthur's mind as\nhe minced across his office, desperately\ntrying to see where he had left his magic\nwand.\n\"If I don't find it soon, I 'll have awful\ntrouble trying to get rid of that nasty\nlittle upstart, Randy Stalker,\" he\nthought. Randy was one of Arthur's minion elves, whom he employed to\ncontrol the worst of citizens' homes-the\nFleamantle. \"If everyone starts showing\nup my incompetence, I 'll never get in\nwith John Secretary,\" he gr umped as\nhe peered behind a filing cabinet to see\nWednesday, 14 December, 1983 UM\nif his wand was there.

I don't see that it is any reason to get\nupset about it; they should be grateful\"\nhe said, although there was no one\nlistening. \"It's an excellent situation.\" At\nwhich point Arthur began to recall\nthose fun-loving evenings at Earl's Caught when he was younger.\n\"Oh, who wrapped that round it,\"\nmoaned Arthur, discovering his wand,\nstuck in a flower pot with mistletoe\nwrapped round it. Romance was not\nsomething that concerned those who\nwere trying to climb up the Baron's ladder of success.\n\"It rots the teeth and shrinks the\nbrain,\" he shouted, sulkily, at his\ngiggling staff who, amused by his\nsearch, had been peeping around the\ndoor. \"Now I 'll easily get rid of Randy.\nGormless Layon is bound to support\nme since I got her that delightful room\nso close to her parking space.

    "content": "A deadly hush came over the room as our\ncaptain began to speak.\n'OK team, this is the big one.'\nBevan swallowed hard. 'You mean, we've\ngot to beat them?'\nWe nodded our heads at him slowly.\n'And I 've been relegated to a crew?'\n'Correct.'\n'But what about Tostevin? Or Baynes? Or\nHill?'\nWe gla ned at each other, wondering\nwhether we should reveal the horrible truth.\nFinally Jones spoke up.\n'They didn't make it.'\nWe bowed our heads, reflecting on the fate\nof our fellow sailors.\n'What's more,' he added nervously, 'Cam-bridge have beaten Oxford.'\nOur objective seemed to be drifting helplessly out of reach.\n'Is it worth discussing tactics?' mumbled\nKennedy.\n'Same plan as last week,' asserted Jones.\n'Kennedy on the starboard pin, Howarth on\nthe port end and I 'll fit in where I can.'\ns We stood there thoughtfully. Finally\nBennet-Clarke spoke up. 'Our only chance is\nto fix the boats.'\n'No,' said Jones. 'We'll sail this one\nstraight.'\nThree hours and five races later, the team\nstumbled back, exhausted.\n'God knows how we managed it,' gasped\nBennett.\n'Even Howarth made it,' jested Bevan.\nDisapproving glances were shot in his\ndirection.\n'Sorry.'\n'He nearly took me out with him,' remarked Kennedy. 'It's a wonder we're both\nstill here.'\nSilence fell over us as the meaning of our\nvictory sank in.\nWe'd beaten Cambridge 4-1.\nBowl sHI mm*\nSecretary's Report\nWe met old rivals Brunei on home ground last\nSaturday, after an ignominious defeat away\nlast match; and we handed them a shock\nwhen our C team demolished theirs. The\nslightly off form A and B teams lost narrowly,\nbut the ladies team lost heavily as usual. So if\nany of you ladies out there can bowl, come\nalong and buttress up the team. We meet\nevery Wedensday at 2:20 in the Chem Eng\nfoyer.\nTim Schofield deserves special mention for\nclearing the vital tenth pin to capture the high\nscore for the day (missing the other nine in the\nprocess). The presence of the reserve member\nof the ladies team was warmly appreciated,\nshe contributed to the excellent performance\nof IC team member Paul Day at the railway\nstation.\nFootbal\nCup Success\nIC3 vs QMC4 3-0\nIC's sole survivors in the cup this year\nmarched triumphantly through to a semifinal draw against Kings 2 or UC 3 in this\ntheir final match of the term.\nWith Martin Barnes still injured, the old\nfaithful were augmented by the dashing Dave\nWadsworth who turned in his usual gritty\nperformance in midfield. The ever style-conscious thirds decided early on that the\nnormal strip didn't go with Dave's eyes and\nso decided to exchange for bilberry flavour\nshirts courtesy of Farnham Common HC.\nEarly IC pressure paid off as careless\nback pass under pressure caught the unfortunate QMC keeper off his line. Selflessly,\nHors(e) decided not to save the face of Mary's star centre-back and was content to mind the\nball over the line.\nMeanwhile...the appearance on the touch-line of substitute Steve Coussens some 20\nminutes late and clad immodestly in bikers\ngear seemed to unsettle our opponents\nfurther and, not wishing to be different, they\nallowed Torsten the opportunity to score his\nthirteenth clinically taken goal of the season\nshortly before the break.\nResponding to the usual stirring half time\nteam talk IC pri sed home the advantage early\non as Mark slotted in his thir cf this term. Soon\nafter, Mark decided he'd done enough to earn\nhis beer and allowed Steve to take the field.\nStripping off his pseudo-leathers, Curly\nreveals his latest on park trend in ess... leg warmers. So taken aback were we that our\nusual complacency crept in and only some\nfine work from keeper Paul Simpson allowed\nus to keep our clean sheet.\nAll the teams played this week, although not\nnecessarily successfully.\n' The first team played on Friday and Chris\nhasn't told me how they did so they probably\nlost, despite Chris' un doubt ably valiant ef-forts.\nThe second team, in their first report able game, lost but only by 7-2; the 2 being gained\nby one of the opposition running away (from\nme) and Wladek getting about twenty edges\nper game versus another of them. All this is\nirrelevant as the star of the show was Geoff,\nwho despite a strained lower calf muscle and\nMechanics problem sheets turned out to put\nin probably his best performance of the\nseason.\nThe fourth team, under the captaincy of\nMike for the first time lost, but valiantly\nconsidering their opposition were top of the\ndivision at the time.\nErica's team also played on Friday and\n(because Erica didn't play) they haven't told\nme how they did but Erica thinks that they\nprobably lost.\nCHAMPIONS\n1C Lire Southern Universities Water Polo\nKings!\nOn Salurday 3 December IC Water Polo\nteam won the Southern Universities Athletic\nUnion Water Polo Championship held at IC.\nThe competition has much stronger than the\nI' lU league which IC have mono polis ed for a long lime, but thanks to a superstar performance by Welsh internationl Geoff Hurley,\nbacked up with a determined team effort, IC\nprovided the finale to an exciting after noo a's polo by beating Bath 4-3.\nIn the preliminary group matches IC drew\n6-6 with arch enemies Bristol in a very close\ngame. We started off quite sleepily but were\nswiftly woken by a31 de fec it. Hurley shot us\nback into the game at 6-5 we were one second\naway from victory. Alas we conceded a penalty giving Bristol a not undeserved draw.\nHaving thrashed Southampton 14-1 upstaging Bristol, we went into the final group\nas winners, here IC played the other preliminary group runner-up: Reading. By now\nthe team talks were having an effect on IC\nwho shocked their faithful supporters by\ntaking the lead through two goals by Boggy.\nAlthough the first half was close, IC built on\nthe 4-3 half time score to record an 8-4 victory\nover a team only beaten 2-1 by Bath.\nHaving beaten Bristol, Bath needed to win\nor draw their last match with IC to win the\ntournament. Thus the match was cleared of\nmathematical solutions and reduced to a win\nor nothing scenario for us. At this stage of the\nevening fitness and determination were just as\nvital as ball skills but nevertheless IC were\nconfident when the final game started.\nFor a few minutes Bath appeared to have\ngiven up as IC took a swift 3-0 lead. The\naction then started as Bath fought back to\nreduce the defeat to 3-1 at half time through a penalty. The second half saw IC display the\nsame lapse of concentration and suddenly.\nBath were back in the game at 3-3 as the teams\ntired.\nBath still appeared stronger but on one of\nIC's consistently dangerous breakaway s, a penalty was conceded. The number of IC\nplayers who actually watched Hurley convert\nthe penalty could not have been many but\nfrom then on IC were on the defensive. Three\nminutes is a long time when the clock is\nstopped for every stoppage of play: but with\ndetermined defence, a few mistakes from\nBath and a little luck we held on to achieve\nsuccess unsurpassed by previous IC sides.\nUndoubtedly Hurley was the star, but he\nreceived magnificent support from Robert\nEastman. Although none of it would have\nbeen possible without any of the other eight\nplayers, or without Dan's magnificent efforts\nin controlling the team from the side, or of\ncourse without the supp or et ers, and of course\nMrs Peart.\nAs for greater things, the UAU national\nfinal will be in March so the team will be\ntraining twice weekly til then. Traihing will be\n6:30-11:00 each Monday and Friday with\n9:30-11:00 being devoted to boat race skills\nand the rest to a warm up in the pool!\nTeam: Python (Capt), Hurley, Chorlton,\nEdwards, Boucher, Eastman, Richardson,\nBurr, Crowder, Kalkanis, Peart, Langman,\nMorris (manager).\nPage 181 Wednesday, 14 December, 1983 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "of the plug hole and enter the various orifices\nof the heroine. In Videodrome, James\nWoods plays a soft-porn cable TV programmer who tries to tape a pri ate transmission which specialises in perverted\nsex and torture. Instead he finds himself\nsucked up into the TV screen via the loving\nembrace of his girlfriend with S/M tendencies\n(Debbie Harry trying to kill her Blondie\nimage). From this point onwards lots of\nspecial effects are used to persuade you that\nsomething funny is going on, whilst you slide\nquietly into total apathy. The plot, script\nand acting exponentially decay to the lowest\nlevel I 've slept 'h rough in a long time. The\noriginal idea was quite good\u2014how do you\nknow what is Yr\n- j l and what isn't? \u2014but it's totally mishandled.\nIt seems the latest trend is to put failing film\nideas into 3D to try to re vital is e them. Not\nonly will there be a3D Star Trek next year,\nbut now we have Jaws 3D( Plaza).\nUnfortunately the Jaws idea really has been\nflogged to death, and this film adds nothing\nnew. Apparently a lot of care and money was\nspent in making the wounds and the shark\nlook super-realistic, but so what? The\nfrightening thing about a shark is the\npsychological effect it has on people, not the\nrealism of the blood and gore. 3D adds\nsomething, but without the back-up of a good\nplot, script and acting, it's not enough to\nspend \u00a33 on, especially if you've seen Jaws\nalready.\nA scene from Parade, starring Jacques\nTati'\nParade (Barbican) along with two short\nsketches is a celebration of the French comic\ngenius, Jaques Tati. 'Who?' was exactly my\nresponse at first. In fact Tati is rather like an\naccident prone Eric Sykes and brilliant at\nmime. Parade gently examines eccentricity\namongst the audience of ageing hippies and\nthe performers at a Scandanavian circus\nThere are a series of acts, some good, some\npathetic, but mostly you're twiddling your\nfingers waiting for Tati to come back on. The\nfilm is too long and the individual acts just\ndon't hang together, but Parade is worth\nconsidering if you're in London and have to\nentertain some bored young visitors one\nafternoon over Christmas. On the other\nhand, The Jungle Book (Odeon Leicster\nSquare) \\c probably better, because\neveryone enjoys that.\nTony Atkins\nDaniel (Notting Hill Gate from 12\nJanuary). Considering the weak fictional\nframework around which his book is based, EL Doctorow, author of The Book of Daniel\nand in charge of screenplay for the film, has\nmade a very brave effort indeed. Originally\nwritten in 1971, 'Daniel' is \"the story of two\ngenerations of a family whose ruling passion\nis not success or money or love, but social\njustice.\"\nDaniel is a graduate student when, after\na nervous breakdown and attempted\nsuicide by his politically active sister, he\ndecides to uncover the facts surrounding the\ntrial and execution of their parents, Paul and\nRochelle Issaacson, who were found guilty of\nconspiring to steal US atomic secrets for the\nRussians.\nVisually, the film has much potential.\nSusan's agonising breakdown at the\nbeginning of the film contrasts with the\npowerful execution scene of her father and\nmother in the electric chair. All too often\nhowever, the film is spoilt by sterile and over\nsentimental imagery. Daniel, at the age of\neight, looks like some child prodigy of Elvis\nPresley, and his father looks like Clark Kent.\nYou're supposed to be watching \"a search\nfor self-discovery\", but this film often seems\ninstead to be the very last remake of Hair.\nBecause the scope of this film is so diffuse,\nit is impossible to commit it to any particular\ncategory.

John\nSecretary, reluctantly concluding that\nhis work would not be done for some\ndays yet, returned to his self-imposed\nexile, in a dungeon in the very depths of\nthe Surefield Building. And it was with\nconsiderable belligerence that he\nperused his planning of the move of the\ncitizens' building to a basement in\nSouthside.\n\"Let me see, with a Citizens' Office of\nthat size, Mrs Jolly Hockey-Sticks is\nbound to agree to all my other demands\nwithout question,\" he thought. John\nSecretary was well aware of whose\nopinion counted for something. \"With\nall that room, the President's Office can\nbe kept well away from the citizens'\nentrance.

It had yet to recover\nfrom the day when Mrs Sticks had filled\nit with sherry instead of ink.\n\"You'd think that she'd remember\nwhat false labels she puts on the damn\nbottles,\" said Sawnoff to his friend. But\nhe received no reply, for that friend was\nthe heir apparent to the presidency, the\nmegalomaniac Ian Balls. He was all too\nwell aware that, if his election was to\nsucceed, he must not offend the all-powerful Mrs Sticks. The memory of\nhow she had connived to evict a previous representative, claiming that\nshe had 'a sleep problem' was never\nfar away. Ian Balls knew when some\nthings were better left unsaid.\n\"Time to go, darlings,\" declared the\nsomewhat merry Mrs Sticks as she\ntumbled head over heels down the\nstairs of the citizens' building. She was\nnot used to the office being open after\nfour in the afternoon and was still just in\nsufficient control of her senses to know\nthat, with a few drinks inside them, the\nrepresentatives might start examining a few filing cabinets and their contents.\nBut they all meekly obeyed and Mrs\nSticks firmly locked the door behind\nthem.\nAs the citizens slept, and Mrs Sticks\nmeandered towards home, Pristine, the\nwicked witch of Southside, was to be\nseen on her broomstick hovering over\nher small domain. With her baggage\nswaying in the wind, she gleefully stared\nover her Empire, from which she was\nabout to depart. Turning her broomstick in the direction of her far away\ncastle, she cried out:\n\"I will return.\"\nCackling with laughter, she sped\nacross the buildings. And return she\nwould for, despite many hopes and\nprayers, she always found an excuse to\ncome back.\nFELIX Wednesday, 14 December, 1983 Page 13\n\n"

    "content": "Bot Zoo to Open!\nThe Bot-Zoo tea room is to reopen next term following\npressure from FELIX and Life\nSciences students led by the Dep\nRep Tim Wilson. It is not yet\nclear whether the Biology\nDepartment or the Union will be\nrunning the service, which will\nonly be available in the mornings.\nThe room itself is a Union\nroom but because of a longstanding agreement it is under the\ncontrol of the department during\nthe day, originally because of the\ndepartment's tea service.\nProfessor Wood, head of the\nBiology department, was anxious\nthat with the demise of the service\nthe room should still remain\nunder his control as before. He\nwrote to Union President Gaynor\nLewis asking her to confirm the\nagreement, saying that it was\nnecessary to preserve the\narrangement in case the\ndepartment ever re-started the\ntea service. This Miss Lewis\nrefused to do unless there was a firm commitment to re-starting\nthe service.\nProfessor Wood replied saying\nthat he hoped the department\nwould be able to re-open the tea\nroom next term, and promised to\ngive a definite decision before the\nstart of next term.\nMeanwhile, the Union has\nbeen planning to re-open the tea\nroom. Internal Services Officer\nHugh Southey has carried out a costing analysis of the service and\nconcluded that it could be run on\na self-financing basis. Deputy\nPresident Christine Teller has\nagreed to oversee the financial\nside of the operation. If Professor\nWood does not re-open the tea\nroom then it appears the Union\nwill step in to provide the service.\nNo Nonsense NOS\nThe Imperial College mainframe\nhas been running on a new\noperating system since Monday.\nThe main purpose of the new\nsystem is to bring into operation\nthe new Cyber 855 that arrived in\nsummer. This machine is three\ntimes more powerful than the\nCyber 174 currently in use and\noffers users an increased core\nmemory of 80k decimal words\nafter 6:00pm. There is also a new\ncategory for batch jobs with up to\n131k decimal words available.\nThe immediate differences for\nundergraduates are the new\nlogging in procedure and the\ngreatly increased line speeds on\nsome terminals (2400 baud rather\nthan 300). There are minor\nchanges in some of the\ncommands and other, major\nchanges for more advanced users.\nA total of over 200 people\nattended Dramsoc's Christmas\nproduction The Unknown Soldier\nand His Wife last week. The play,\nwritten by Peter Ustinov, proved\nto be a humorous evening's entertainment with the comical\naspects of the script being\nportrayed to the full by a cast of\nvarying experience, some of\nwhom were appearing on stage\nfor the first time. The production\nPage 4 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 ^ \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 MMM H used a minimum amount of set,\nrelying more upon the\ncostumes\u2014many of which had\nbeen made specially for the\nshow\u2014and a variety of props to\nportray images. The show's director, Ian Lacey, was said to\nbe pleased with the way it went\nalthough he spent much of the\nfirst performance in the bar and\nwas too tired and emotional to\ncomment further.\nStudent Dies\nin Sports Centre\nA student was drowned in\nmysterious circumstances in the\nCollege swimming pool on\nMonday. He was discovered on\nthe bottom of the pool by\nmembers of the Water Polo Club\nwho were practising in the pool.\nThe swimming pool is open for\ngeneral swimming on Mondays\nuntil 6:15pm, when it is cleared\nby the attendant. Then at 6:30pm the Water Polo Club have apr via te session until 8:30pm, when the Swimming Club take\nover. It was whilst the Water\nPolo goals were being taken\ndown and replaced with rope lane\nmarkers at the change over time\nthat the body was noticed at the\nbottom of the deep end of the\npool.\nThe body was recovered from\nthe pool and members of the\nWater Polo and Swimming Clubs\nattempted to revive the student\nusing artificial respiration and\nheart massage but to no avail. It\nwas apparent that the body had\nbeen in the water for a considerable time.\nIt is known that the student,\nChristopher Darkes of Electrical\nEngineering 1, left a lecture at\n5:30pm and went to the Sports\nCentre. It is also known that he\nwas fond of swimming lengths\nunderwater. What is still unclear\nhowever is exactly when he\nentered the pool. If he was lying\non the bottom of the pool at the\nend of general swimming at\n6:15pm then he should have been\ndiscovered by the pool attendant\non duty, although because of the\nshape of the pool bottom it is\npossible that he wasn't seen at\nthis time.\nThe most likely explanation,\nhowever, is that he entered the\npool (probably for the second\ntime that evening) at between\n7:15 and 7:25pm when two girls\nwho were watching the water\npolo remember seeing a stranger\nenter the pool room. They did not\nnotice him again, but they think\nthat the body removed from the\npool (when they were still\npresent) was the person they saw\nentering just over an hour earlier.\nOBITUARY\nChristopher Darkes\nIt is with deep regret that we report the death of\nChristopher Darkes, a first year Electrical Engineering\nstudent and resident of Falmouth Keogh Hall. He was\ndrowned in the College swimming pool on Monday 5\nDecember, despite the valiant attempts to revive him by\nstaff and students in the Sports Centre.\nAlthough at College for less than a term, Chris\ncontributed a great deal to Hall and College life. He was a most popular and friendly student who was always\nwilling to help others. Chris will be sorely missed by us\nall.\nOur deepest sympathy is extended to his family,\ngirlfriend and many friends in Hall and Department. His\nfuneral took place on Monday 12 December at Stanford\nRivers, Essex, but a short memorial service is being held\nat 9:00am on Thursday 15 December in Southside Upper\nLounge for anyone who wishes to attend.\nPaul Jowitt\nMerry Xmas from Sir Keith!\ni Wednesday, 14\nThe Secretary of State for\nEducation Sir Keith Joseph\nannounced in the House of\nCommons that the student grant\nfor next session will rise by 4%.\nThe parental contribution scale\nwill rise in line with earnings at\nthe lower end, but parents in the\nDecember, 19839MR D WB WD M middle and upper income\nbrackets will have their\ncontributions increased by a greater amount.

    "content": "Puzzled Packed Christmas Special!\nWelcome to the double spread Ulysses, with plenty of puzzles\nfor you to try over the vacation, if you're not too busy with\nreports to write or if you haven't overdone the festivities. Some\nof the puzzles are difficult and are marked with a dagger and\nare worth \u00a35 each, donated, as ever, by Mend-a Bike of Park\nWalk, just off Fulham Road. The unmarked ones are purely for\nyour entertainment. Thanks to all those who have tried any of\nthe puzzles. Many thanks to Achilles, Nick Williams, Olympus,\nRev and Anatoly for their puzzles and ideas, and special thanks\nto Mend-a Bike, without whose generosity there would be no\npuzzles column. Good luck, everyone, for the last time this\nterm, and Merry Christmas to you all.\nSolutions to the FELIX Office by 1:00pm on the first\nWednesday of term, please.\nHere's a long division puzzle with only one\ndigit. Fill in the blank spaces to obtain the\nunique solution.\nIf you've been trying the University Prize\nCrossword, you might like to have a go at\nthese. They are some of my favourite cryptic\ncrossword clues.\n1. Gegs (9, 4)\n2. I JK LMN(5)3. World Cup team produces duster (6, 6)\n4. (5, 3, 1, 4)\n5. Yob\u2014in need of remedial attention (8,\n3)\nt Solution\nThe Triangular Duel\nThe key to this puzzle was in working out the\nbest strategies for each of the gunmen. A's best strategy is to shoot at B first, B's best\nstrategy is to shoot at A first, if C shoots at B, and hits, then he's dead, and if C shoots at A and hits, he stands only 20% chance of\nshooting again,so C's best strategy is to\nintentionally miss until either A or B is dead,\nand then he stands a50% chance of winning.\nIf you work out all possible series of events,\nthe probabilities of each are:\nA3/10B%5C*%| So the poorest shot has the best chance of\nwinning, and in fact his probability of winning\nis greater than his accuracy. Nine correct\nsolutions for this one, and the winner was J Bryson of Chem Eng 3, who can collect his\ncheque from the FELIX Office any time.\nMany thanks to Olympus for that brain-teaser. ^\nThe Square-Wheeled Bicycle\nThis is an adaptation of an Oxbridge entrance question shown to me by my friend\nRev, and is a chance for all the Oxbridge\nrejects to show that they were wrong not to\ntake you.\nI was down at Mend-a Bike's garage the\nother day, and they had just finished their\nChristmas party. One of the workers there\nhad had rather too much to drink, and was\nbusy trying to knock one of the bikes back\ninto shape. When he had finished, the wheels\nof the bike were square, but he was too drunk\nto notice and left the bike to be sold. If the\nwheels are equal size, in synchro n is m and the\nbike rolls with constant horizontal velocity,\nhow fast can it go before its wheels start to\nleave the ground?\n\n"

This we expect\nanyway so it was a real bonus for\nCostello to abandon his troublesome\nmedia image to make several television\nappearances and grant several inter-views, leading to his appear n ce on the\ncover of Time Out and The Face in the\nsame week.

The Imposter,\nwas released as a limited edition with the\npromise of a possible 'celebration twelve\ninch on red vinyl'. Costello had further\nsuccess with Everday I Write the Book\nalthough all the singles failed to chart\ndent the top ten, the album topped the\ncharts and the follow up tour was a success.\nUnfortunately the same can't be said\nof the Undertones, undoubtedly the\ngreatest live band in the world. Their\nfourth album The Sin of Pride was a masterpiece, showing a heavy sixties\ninfluence and receiving a unanimous\nthumbs up from the critics. Unfortunately no one bought it and thus the\nunrelenting economics of the music\nindustry deprived us of the Undertones.\nTheir singles package All Wrapped Up\nwill no doubt be viewed as an essential\nalbum in years to come.\nBefore mentioning other bands who\nhave gone the way of the Undertones it\nonly \u00abrem a. us to bring together some\nloose ends.

One naughty crew\nmanaged to do a three point turn\nin one go by using the front lawn\nand then making are lativi s it getaway before the occupants\nwoke up. Nick Anderson confirmed his fears by impaling his\nMini on a tree, the effect of which\nwas to place a front wheel on his\nnavigator's lap. All this rushing\naround led to every crew being\n'Over Time Limit' at half-way\nwhere despite being kept warm\nby her driver, the Herald\nnavigator found the freezing\nconditions too much especially as\nshe'd already been sick twice, so\nthey trundled home at 4:00am.

This seems to derive\nfrom a conversation I had with\nSean Davis (Irishman) and the\ndelectable Miss Lewis about\nconferences in general. My\nopinion at the time (and still is)\nwas that although INCOST was\nnot financially beneficial to\nICU the contacts made and\ninformation exchanged with\nother student officers were very\nuseful. As a college we are\nhighly respected in all fields of\ntechnology and as such should\nbe seen to take part in a collective European student\norganisation.\nPerhaps you should have\nconsulted me rather than rely\non biased opinions such as that\nof Sean.

    "content": "Kevlewsl\nor Christmas\n-SEAN\nCONNER/\nNEVER\nNWER\nNever Say Never Again (Warner West\nEnd) marks the return of Sean Connery as\nJames Bond. Connery looks a little old, but\nall the magnetism is still there. He has real\nscreen presence throughout the film, except\nwhen Rowan Atkinson as an upper class\nForeign Office twit steals the show.\nI found the last few Bond movies too\ngimmicky, but Never Say Never Again has\nmore of a plot and a far fresher atmosphere\nabout it. SPECTRE manages to steal two\ncruise missiles armed with nuclear\nwarheads\u2014Bond has to find them before\nthey are blown up. There are all the\ntraditional elements of a good Bond\nfilm\u2014beautiful girls, gun and fist-fights, high-tech, glamorous locations and car chases.\nThe Bond formula is now tuned to a fine art\nand the mix of 'gratuitous sex and violence' is\nhighly successful. The whole thing is totally\npreposterous and great fun.\nIf you liked Bond movies in the past, Never\nSay Never Again is a must.\nThere has been a dearth of good comedies\nrecently, which may help explain the huge\nand unexpected success of Trading Places\n(Empire 2). In the US this success has been\nof near ET proportions. The two stars, Dan\nAckroyd (1941, The Blues Brothers) and\nEddie Murphy (48hrs) have become cult\nfigures, as has director John Landis, famous\nfor Kentucky Fried Movie and Animal\nHouse.\nAckroyd plays a rich and smug junior\npartner in the Duke and Duke firm of\ncommodity brokers; Murphy is a street-wise\nloser and con man. The evil Duke brothers,\nbored with conventional entertainment,\nwonder how Ackroyd will react if he is slung\nout on the streets, and what Murphy will do if\nhe is given everything Ackroyd has. This is\nthe starting-point for a hectic film that tries to\nbe satirical and ends up farcical, but is a success through it's sheer vitality and good\nhumour.\nTrading Places reminds me of 'Soap',\nbecause it trys to mix frantic and zany action\nwith moral points. But the pretensions to\nmaking comments about rich people versus\npoor people are smothered by Ackroyd who\noveracts and always looks as if he's about to\nburst out laughing at himself. Murphy\nhowever is just brilliant and British actor\nDenholm Elliott as Ackroyd's butler can say\nmore with the lift of an eyebrow than any of\nthe Americans (who instead tend to machine-gun you with the gags). Although too slow in\nstarting and too rushed at the end, this film is\nmarvellously funny and really gets you\ninvolved. There's nothing quite like the\nsound of a full cinema audience laughing\ntogether\u2014it beats the solitary watching of\nTV and video hands down.\nDan Ackroyd in 'Trading Places'.\nHitchcock's Rear Window (Plaza 2,\nClassic Chelsea) is a long unavailable cl as sic. Due to copyright squabbles the film has\nnot been legally shown for twenty years.\nAfter a triumphant reissue at the London\nFilm Festival, it is now on general release, and\nso many of today's films just fade away before\nit. Over the next few months four more\nHitchcock classics will be re released Vertigo, The Man Who Knew Too Much,\nThe Trouble With Harry and Rope.\nThis will be a rare feast of great Hitchcock\nfilms.\nThe story is about a temporarily wheel-bound photographer (James Stewart) who\nspends his time watching the activities of his\nneighbours in the buildings across the\ncourtyard. He be coms fascinated in\ndiscovering all about their lives until, over\nseveral days, he becomes convinced that a murder has taken place in one particular\napartment. His girlfriend (Grace Kelly\nlooking absolutely stunning) is as doubtful\nabout this as Stewart is about marrying her.\nThis reluctance convinces you Stewart is\ndefinitely round the twist. The rest of the film\nfollows his attempt to convince the other\ncharacters that he isn't mad and that a murder has occurred.\nThe plot is simple enough, but a lesser\ndirector than Hitchcock would have quailed\nat the constraint of shooting almost the entire\nfilm through just one open window.\nHitchcock however revels in it. You never\nwant to leave that room, even though film is\nsupposed to be the medium of the wide-open\nspaces. Like being a bie to read minds, the\nidea of freely watching other people's lives is\na fascinating and dangerous one. You find\nout things you shouldn't or would rather not\ndo.\nThe film was shot over one huge set and\nthe buildings look too theatrical. The action is\nrather slow off the mark but once Grace\nKelly appears the film leaps into life.\nEverything about the murder is perfectly\nshot and paced. With its macabre humour\nand its delicate balancing act between\ncondemning and justifying the voyeur,Rear\nWindow was one of Hitchcock,s favourites.\nIt is definetly now one of mine.\nVideodrome (most ABCs) is a blood and\ngore movie made by a good director, David\nCronenberg, having an off day. Cronenberg\nspecialises in pop-horror-with-a message\nfilms. He directed Shivers which is famous for\nits bathroom scene where worms slither out\nThe Master and James Stewart\nPage 8 Wednesday, 14 December, 1983 IFELIX\n\n"

Now that\nMichael has successfully\nkicked out Andy Walker from\nthe Fremantle there is a vacant honeymoon suite all\nready and waiting for Gary's big day.\nBoth Gary and Andy were\ngood mates of Michael Arthur\nwhen he appointed them to\nthe Fremantle last year.\nHowever, Gary had to be\nmoved to Earl's Court\nSquare, a real pit of a head\ntenancy, where he has since\nbeen feeling the heat due to\nhis failure to get the place in\nany sort of order.

A few years\nago she threw a party at 170\nQueensgate on Commem\nDay. Among the large retinue\nof celebrities present was one\naged lady who had the\nmisfortune to kick the bucket during the party.\nLady Flowers was faced\nwith a dilemma. On the one\nhand it was unthinkable to\nallow doctors into the house\non Commem Day. On the\nother, it would be unseemly\nfor a prostrate figure to be\nremoved, by stretcher, from\nthe party.\nLady Penny, a guest who\nhad some medical experience\n(she was a nurse during the\nwar), advised Lady Flowers\nthat there was no hope for the\npatient. Suddenly the solution\nto the problem occurred to\nthe two venerable peer esse s. Between them the ladies\nmanaged discreetly to\nmanhandle the patient to the\ncupboard-under-the-stairs in\n170. She was propped up\nbeside some old mops and\nbuckets and the door was\nlocked. The heroines were\nthen able to return to the\nparty to social is e and so forth.\nAfter the other guests had\nleft, the corpse (for by then it\nwas such) was tidily disposed\nof in the usual way.\nAren't we lucky to have\nsuch a quick-thinking and\nresourceful lady as our\nRector's wife?\nOats\nDave Parry hasn't been\ngetting his oats recently!
