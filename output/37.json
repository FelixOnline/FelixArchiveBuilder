Brig den,is now in his seventieth year and about to retire for the second time. In1899, when he was 1 7 , Wally deserted the laundry at which he had been working, and after spending a Saturday afternoon persuading the Recruiting ssr ge an t,o vera tankard of beer that he was in fact18, joined the12 th Royal Lancers, just in time for the Boer War. Out in South Africa, Wally and the12 th fought atM a gers font e in, relieved Kimberley, and captured Pretoria. On 1 1 th June,1900, Wally took part in t ne famous charge at Diamond Hill when the Lancers rescued two guns of\" Q\" Battery, R.H.A. His regiment then moved to India, where Wally became sergeant, acted as Company Job's ComT b tter in the Amba la earthquake of1905, and held the regimental HeavyWeight Boxing Championship for8 years. In1910 Wally joined the Bradford Mounted Police. While temporarily bashing a beat on foot Wally was informed by the local butcher that he, Mr. Coul son by name, \" had done the beggars In\". On information thus received Wally inspected the butcher's premis.es to discover that Mr. Coul son had employed the instruments of his trade to decapitate his wife and infant. Wally thereupon effected his most celebrated arrest. Wally rejoined the Lancers for the First WorldWar, was bombarded at Scarborough by the German Fleet, instructed in Musketry( you should hear him yet on the\"M a ming of. Parts\") and rose to Sergeant Major. By the end of the war Wally had been wounded four times. He left the Army to enter the PostOffice, and from that vantage point on the corner of Imperial Institute Road he watched the growth of I.C., and the building of the Union. In1942, at the age of60 l ally\" retired\" to become the doyen of the Imperial College Cerberus es( if you will pardon the plural). For ten y sars Wally has stood at the portals of R.C.S., watching generations of students( and professors) come and go, knowing of each his local habitation and his name, massive and imperturbable as the Rock of Gibraltar. Over his snuffbox and spiked moustaches he has dispensed milk and mails, gossip and good humour in the eddy by his office that flanks the stream through the door s,till a day that does not begin and end with his hail is scarcely think able. Wally has grown into the fabric of the College, one of the principal human memories that most of us will carry away with us from R.C.S. To Wally on his last going down we extend our sincerest wishes for along, peaceful and contented retirement. LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Dear Sir, My effort to free Imperial College from the shac<sies of sartorial conservatism has, as yet, produced no vivid results.' This negative hostility to Advance is not unexpected. Do we not all re mei aber how Galli leo was nearly burned at the s ta^e as an ere tic, when he taught that gravitation was no respect e rore it u er cami on balls ori'G fl tt\\ G1CS? Imperial College is not \u201e.'et sufficiently emancipated to accept' change, unless given in small doses.. I suggest a small dose. Let the s:aar tse t,i.e. those who Ki ve adam n,v/ ear the appropriate Bow Tie. Tn is is at a art, attractive, and a Very Good Thing: Giant a,/ a> cel and near thy tie'.\" ARTURO\",1 Sir Last February FELIX gave the Editor of the' Guilds' Engineer' space to in tr6 duce his journal to students before\nits annual appearance; the resistance to sales in the last week,from students and staff, makes its necessary to reconsider the value of a college technical journal. The ' Guilds' Engineer' publishes the best papers given\nat the Engineering and Radio So cities' Meeting, encourages\nthe writing of further articles, and records the research\nwork and Library pr ogres B of the year. I think that this issue, the third, i3 the best yet, but I feel that the problem of the general appeal of specialized mathematical\npapers must be tackled. The question is what task does this publication perform\nthat is not served either by such as'The Engineer' and ' Engineering', or by the hundreds of particular and recognized\nprofessional journals? If there is none then it will never\nbuild up the circulation for survival it will become a mere carrier of otherwise unwanted technical writings. If it is to achieve some reputation it must be bold and\nrecord everything worthwhile in the work of this college. Finance is the only limit but if the' Guilds Engineer\" is supposed to do this job, it must do it. Although the articles in the three issues to date have been well ranged in subject, this being most true in Number Three, nearly all of them are\ncontributions in a minute part of ea<h field. As such they are\nwell written, and as far as I can judge, they Should be of\ngreat interest to specialists. Most lacking from the papers published are summaries of\neach showing their general importance in each field, and I! feel that separate articles would be of interest linking the\nshort summaries of research given for each department with details of past and present work.\nI would like to add that there is sufficient of general\ninterest in several articles, particularly Mr.James' \" Library Notes\" on searching for technical information, to justify every Guildsman buying this issue, Yours etc.' Contributor' C.&G.23.5.52 Sir,I dont see why l should take my dirty cups and s aue or s baek( if other r otters dont even os Sundays mt ching tenn i8. Washedup.\nThe Guardian ef Felix The Cat, Dear Sir, There are se me people telling that Felix is\\ losing his youthful vigour. In my opinion this is not true, although it may be so in future. I met Fel ix during the pr\u00bbs \u00bbnt academic year and I found\nthat poor cat becomes inclined to develop certain habits, which once formed,may be difficult to remove.\nI noticed also his growing sadness and I wonder what the reason may be.Although he shows that his sense of humour is not completely lost, mainly when he discusses modem inventions, he sometimes\ntries to be funny,but without success. This is the' case when ho makes gossips about other people \" profiles\", Often I have no pleasure to know the people\nconcerned and I feel rather uneasy when he starts to gossip about the persons to whom he did not introduce me previously. This is a bad habit, It seems\nthat poor cat either suffered some misfortune or he\nate too large meal and forces himself to be funny\nwhen his mind is rather suppressed and his stomach\nfull. In fact the cat is very interested in meals. He always grumbles about food and service in the\nRefectory, claiming that It makes a difference for him how milk is served.\nThese are the symptoms which make me\nfeel that poor cat\nbehaves as atypical old bachelor. In fact, he is3 years old-what in a cat's life means that he is a grown up gent le man. Therefore I suggest that there is a right time for our\nFelix to marry.\nAnd he should do\nso at once.This is not\na bad ido a8 It has many advantages!\nAs a person with family responsibilities, Felix will certainly take more forbearing view on College\naffairs, and because he will not be more alone in the\nworld, his personal happiness will further increase his popularity among u s.Iam, Sir, Yours faithfully, Father of one kitten. Dear Sir, It seems, from the FELIX account of the Guilds Motor Rally, that it haB been a success. What a pity then that there is no similar event for motor cycles, which are surely more popular in the college. Perhaps Bome enthusiast, un encumbered by examination\ntrials, may be found to organise something of the kind, or even to institute an I.C. Motor Cycling Club. Yours faithfully, A.R. BRAY\n\n"

The standard of technique was low, as it always is on this unnerving occasion. Those who remembered to keep a straight arm when lunging, most noticeably His s A. Entwistle and the winner J. Mitchell, did well. The runner up,R. Cousins, achieved his position more by insistence of attack than good technique. When everyone had fought everybody it was found that there was a tie for first place between Mitchell and Cousins. A barrage was fought off and the prize, a foil, was awarded to Mitchell. In the evening I.C. beata team from Whit gift School1710. I. CrUCS. OLD BOYS\nI.G. found their best form indecisively defeating U.C. S.Old Boys a tH arlington on 17th May.\nBatting first on a true wicket, I.C. lost two wickets early but with the score at292, Peter Oldland joined Brian Hitchin and there followed a stand of109 for the third wicket. Hitchin, batting with North Country solidity, made\n68 not out while Oldland attacked all the bowlers to score a stylish68. I.C. were now well on top and were soon able to declare at154 for3, made in rather less than two hours.' I/ hen U.C. S.Old Boys batted they were soon in trouble against some accurate pace bowling by Reynolds and Wilson. Wickets fell regularly and they were all out in an hour and\nthree quarters for49.

Stephenson CHE. for printing an incorrect report that he had\nbeen elected President of U.L. Hockey Club. BOWING CHISWICK AM ATP UP, REGATTA\nChiswick Regatta, was rowed off on Saturday, 24th May.\nThe I. C.B.C. was represented by the l st VIII in the Thames\nCup, the2 nd VIII in the Junior Seniors and the3 rd VIII in the Juniors. Although no pots were won, all three crews\nshowed improved form.\nThe 3rd VIII gave an interesting aquatic display for the first two minutes of their heat. At the half distance they were l Jr lengths behind Quintin and 2j behind the Met.\nPolice, but from this point on they settled down to row really well, to pass Quintin and just overlap the Met. Police's rudder at the finish. The 2nd VIII, after their debacle at Putney, have\nimproved enormously and rowed a good race, although beaten\nby Vesta by l/3 length, Ibis being third. On this form they\nare well up to Junior Senior standard and can look forward\nwith confidence to Walton.\nIt is the l st VIII, recovering from an \"awkward\" patch in training, to whom the real honours mu3t go. Winning\ntheir fir3 t heat in a fast time, they met U.C. aid Crowland\nin the final. The U.C. eight, a good, neat, fast crew, took\nfull advantage of the faster water on the Surrey station to take a lead at the start. They were | length ahead at the half dist-ui ee and held this to the bridge. Here, I.C. began\nto go up, and rowing 40 complete strokes in the last a in ute were only 3 feet behind at the finish. This excellent last f*l+ the \u00b0 raw in Z \u00b0oi heart \u2122<* then hard THAMES DITTON TRIP\nThough v/e have never yet won it, Thames Ditton Regatta is always enjoyed by the\" maiden\" VIII that I.C.s end up each year. There are the valuable longer outings obtained while, taking the boat up, in better water and new surroundings, experience including lock negotiation and pleasure steamers. The limited social range of the club's winter rowing begins to broaden where the boat is put up for the night, and the crew are chaperoned to new shores by their coach, who\nbetween his long rides on the bank, is recalling his trip up here x(x=2 or3) years ago, and our other good friends, the members who take the kit up each stage by car. Once again it was good weather. The Saturday( May17 th) was in a sudden heatwave,. There were boats everywhere; lots of ladies, and, here and there, lots of lady. Our crew had improved upon their uncertain showing at Putney, and despite along wait for their he a tatU.30, they settled down to row quite well when the time came, only to lose by half a length to a stronger Reading University crew. The event was won from12 entries by the Building Apprentices Sporting Association, who\nbeat Thames R.C. in the final. So the I.C. fresher s remain maidens. It is a pity that examinations may now take up all the time of its five First Year members. LAWN TENNIS I.C. WIN QUARTER FINAL UL. TENNIS\n( Played at home on Saturday,23 rd May) By beating the College of Estate Management by' seven matches to two, I.C will meet either U.C. or L.S.E. in the semifinal of the U.L. Inter college tournament. This match will be played sometime between June l stand14 that home.\nO.E.M' s team included Ian Maokay ( U.L. Tennis Capt.) who\npartnered bj t Luckett played as the opposition's first pair. The I.C. Captain knew that this pair were the danger but Forbes and McDonald ( playing as the home team'sl st pair) held their own and won in two sets with scores of62;86. I.C.'s2 nd pair( Spence-Bate and Ward) and 3rd pair( Grossman and Pile) lost to McKay and partner, these being the only two matches\nc once ede d. The tennis was,on the whole, not of a very high standard\nand 3ome improvement will be necessary if we are to reach, let alone win, the final.

    "content": "FELIX s STOPWATCH FROM- OUH HOROLOGICAL CORRESPONDENT\nIntroduction; On consultation of the possibility of buying a watch, this learned body decided to investigate analytically the claim of a well known firm of h oro logi sts that their timepiece made the journey from King's Cross to Edinburgh attached to the piston rod of the Flying Scotsman, without detriment to itself or apparent harm to the engine attached there to. Assumptions:(1) Speed of express train( by definition)=60 mph.(2) Diameter of Driving Wheel s:2yd s.( as for Charles I)(3) Piston Strokes26\"( Machine Drawing and Design by W. Abbot, p.87, pub. Blackie& Sons Ltd., London and Glasgow,10/6 d.)=2r.(4) That the length of the connecting rod is long compared to that of the crank.(5) That if and when you drop your watch you drop it through a height of3 ft., and that as a result it buries itself in the floor to a depth of0.01\". Calculations: Speed of train=60 mph = 8 8 ft/se c..'. Angular Velocity of Driving Wheels88 x2 tr\n~ err\n= ~ radians/ sec.. Max. acc el' of piston oV*,29 g..^13=931 ft/se c1.*12 If U ft/se c. is velocity of watch on being dropped from a height of3 ft., at the instant before it touches the ground, U* \u00ab 2 xg*3 \u00ab 1 8 7 ' 2 .\". u*13'67 ft/se c. and if A ft/se c is the deceleration applied to the watch to bring it to a stop in001\",0=1872+12 x Ax1)(1200).'.A=112,320 ft/se c^3,490g. Conclusions: Thus it can it be seen that whilst the test on the Flying Scotsman subjects the watch to acceleration and deceleration equal to29 g., the dropping of a watch on to a fairly soft floor subjects the poor beast to a deceleration of3,490 g.,i.e.120 times as great, and demonstrates the complete worthlessness of the test as far as the watch is concerned. What effect it had on the carefully balanced reciprocating parts of the locomotive we\nhave been unable to ascertain. A Cuckoo Clock was finally purchased. Jt \u00bb iT WAIT T/ CU.

Perhaps the brightest moment of his career came when\nBas. took the game to other side of the Atlantic, last Summer. In the high sounding Canadian \"Gold Belt Championships'1\nhe played ' first string' for the Novanda ~ team, in several matches, and although the championship was lost, the ' Northern Daily News' was full of praise for\" the youthful Bryan Pile\" and for the way in which he 'bar ved his way to victory\".

The result of this foolish fashion race Was yellow gums in a blue blackface, But. liable considered she'd been hasty, Although the toothpaste was quite tasty, For while she was In the height of fashion The boyfriends showed a loss of passion.

Those of the party who sought tranquility and its attendant diversions alighted at Arundel whilst the remainder, benton, dare we say more lively pursuits continued to Littlehampton. We will draw a veil over the various activities of the party during the afternoon and content ourselves with the statement that the return journey commenced from Littlehampton at5 p.m. Collecting the remainder of the party at Arundel, the coach continued to Horsham where an excellent dinner was served, members competing for the honour of disposing of the largest quantity of food( solid and liquid).\" Fallen Angels\", performed by the Horsham Repertory Company formed the next diversion, after which there was a period of50 minutes before closing time and the return to London when the coach was helped on its way by melodious accompaniment.

Annual Sport sheldon21 st May a tH arlington is written primarily for the benefit of the1400 odd students who could not tear themselves away from their horrible hide y holes for a few hours. The Gods smiled again this year with brilliant sunshine tempered to the fevered brow by as light breeze as six happy laughing bus loads of competitors officials and staff arrived a tH arlington to be\ngreeted by the glamourous ladies of I. C.W. A. resplendent in white summer tea cosies or hats. Marshalled by the dove like tones of one J. Howarth, mercifully inaudible over most of the ground, the competitors for the first race were soon straining at the leash. After the false start for forms sake, Freddie Brown demonstrated his great hurdle felling technique, which performance he obligingly repeated against that old stage r Geoff. Fish wick in his positively last appearance, to win the final of the120y ds. hurdles. One of the most exciting moments was provided by the100y ds. sprint with the first three running level the whole way, the verdict being given to J.B. Davies and Bres Barry, as having in front of the everlasting Tony Watts. The pole vault developed into a tussle between the same J.B. Davies and Atkinson of contrasting styles, the latter eventually clearing10'.3\". Due to Doc Sparks' s efforts a gallant band of staff were rounded up and stampeded along the100y ds. stretch. Had the Doc reserved his energies he might have increased the star the had given himself, but as it was, George Sweet in g,on winged feet, overtook Miss Pratt at the post, to gain the coveted prize of Bruno Flake( his own\nbrand). How Doug Curzon ever gets over the bar is quite a mystery it must be the spring in the air, but he manages. He was eclipsed, however, by\nM. Rick ard, U.L. champion who cleared6'0\", beating the previous best by2\" with faultless jumping. During the tea interval, when tea could be\nobtained if you waited long enough, the Fencing Club gave an exhibition of foils and ep^e, while Ted Bell, answering the open invitation showed just how difficult it all was. We'd rather stick to pistols. Judging from the number of runners from the Mines. and the number that cot no further than the last obstacle, beer is a matter of great importance. The race was won by Tony Peacock wba cheated. Lady Hill drew the official proceedings to a close when she graciously presented the prizes( after Dai Nicholas had dropped them).

The Wet t field Debate and Dance was chiefly rem\nark able for its exclusiveness. A small number of disinterested alumni debated the power of the press on Friday the16 th of May, and far reaching decisions of a seditious nature, were made. The speaking was of a quite high standard, particularly from the floor, and a small bomb shell in the shape of Margaret Hutchinson( Westfield) rocked the platform for several minutes. Louis Cohen gave a considered and well balanced picture of the case for the motion and was well supported by Weill Blackmore, who contrived to tie many knots and yet have many loose ends lying around for the audience to nibble. The\nopposition was almost extricated from its impossible position by some complicated and obscure argument from Ruth wais h, but not quite. It was in fact decided that the press did wield more power than the government, an a after celebrating this happy conclusion by attacking an optimistic array of cakes and coffee, the evening settled down to a subdued dance which had all the hallmarks of a ritual. For the first time in I.C. history an exact equilibrium was achieved between males and females, which was successfully maintained until10,30 p.m.( and, it is thought may well have continued afterwards in other surroundings).

    "content": "FELIX a THE NEWSPAPER OF' IMPERIa X COLLEGE sbh oj uK. P. ELDRTDGE\nThe email attendance of spectators a tH arlington l to. watch, the Annual Sports is one more indication of the lack of interest and support by the greater proportion of members in this College in activities which do not immediately and directly benefit them. When we first came to I.C. we were subjected to cajoling, pleading s, and perorations from all quarters not to be brown bag gers and slaves to work, but to enter into the social life of the College and to maKe I.C. the foremost of the University. These attacks have been repeated at intervals and with decreasing intensity. The time has surely come when I.C. should withdraw its head from the s and and to wipe the s and from its eyes. For too long energies have been misdirected in trying torn aK eI.C.a College of the University, misdirected oe cause the University does not exist, Out only the\" Technical Institutes of London\". At no time has the main Body of students pursued its course in the search of^ oi owl edge or of disinterested learning. The colleges of London have merely been used to provide students with the right letters after their names to earn larger salaries. This stratagem has long been detected by employers of even the most limited acumen, and failed by the remarkably meagre pittances offered to holders of a mere degree. The aim of a University should be to allow the culture instilled in early life to bear fruit. In this London fails miserably. It produces very few who are educated and no technicians, or more grandiloquent ly technologists, but thousands of intolerant and half baked creatures fit for very little at all. That some emerge from the chaos victorious, is a blessing for which we should all be forever thankful. It is also an indication that there is some\ndemand lor certain of the products the enlightened technologists of the present system. It is time that London colleges dropped the sham facade and pretensions to being of a University and presented the true colours of interested ambition and munificent mercenary remuneration.. Wo University can give culture nor educate anyone. It is folly to aem and that it should. Culture is subtly acquired during the early formative years of one's life. All that the University can do is to encourage plants to develop by providing the right soil and climate. For the most part the people, you and I, that come to this College are ignorant of much that is good and beautiful in this. world, the humanities and arts. Due to our early backgrounds the seed or culture is not within us; and no amount of wishful thinking can alter or cover our appalling ignorance. The Touchstone wee ice nds and similar endeavours, though in themselves most laudable enterprises, areas predestined to overall failure as any gardener, however, expert, with neither seeds nor plants. We are not the raw material for silk purses. Lest it be thought that it is considered that only\" Scientists\" are of this under bred and undernourished class it should be borne in mind that many or the\" Arts\" students, be they never so well versed in the histories of the world writings from u io sesto maugham, or the development of tec to rial representation from unnamed cavemen to Dali, they are often completely unaware or trie existence of other forms of expression or of the sciences. One' more depressing thought arises. i a ost of us. are so engrossed in furthering our individual ends, that no amount of reformation or out lo oic by the more broad minded, or reconciliation to the fact that their cherished dreams of. putting I. C.at the head of the University in all fields of endeavour must crumble, will alter the fact that we as the products of a technical degree factory, shall give nothing to social life CLASSICAL RELATIVITY V 'hen Paris read the theory of dimensions, applied to curvilinear extensions, he promptly told fair Helen his intentions. As she refused, according to conventions he carried her to Troy and, Homer mentions,. a war was waged with devilish inventions. Moral:\" The road to Hell is paved with Greek declensions.\" The President' g Past Sports Day Message\nThe President was heard after the annual sports, to say\nof tho gallant1400,\" Blast the lot of 'em.'\" Atleast that is what he meant.\nNO NEWS At this time of the year the College appears to be seized by a creeping paralysis. Sports Day is the last indication that there is anything else in the world but WORK. The undergraduates are wording, thinking they ought to be working or thinking tn at it' saD out time they thought about doing some work. Even postgraduates, with an eye on next year's grant, are getting down to their annual bout of work( approximately one month) before their well earned summer\nvacation. Mow while this spectacle of fifteen hundred noses to fifteen hundred grindstones may be gratifying to the teaching staff, it makes the life of the F ii LIX Hews Editor very hard. This fellow, being a conscientious type, is anxious to please the readers of FELIX by informing them of what goes on in I.C.Hi steam of star reporters, who are omnipresent, omniscient and omnivorous, in normal times provide those brilliant dispatches from our far flung possessions( headed: Huxley Building, Tuesday), or from the inner sanctums of Government( The oar, Friday night).
