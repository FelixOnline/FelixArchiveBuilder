A\nFunny Thing... follows\nthe relationship between a\nyoung stand-up comedian\nand a middle-aged man\nin the throes of divorce,\nbrought together in the\nsame hospital room where\ntheir mothers are being\nhospitalised for cancer.\nImmediately, the juxtaposition between Karla\u2019s\nraunchy jokes and the air\nof death in the hospital\nsetting becomes clear,\nand it is this relationship\nthat the intermission-less,\n80 minute play goes on\nto explore with wit and\ntenderness.\nThe antagonism\nbetween the two visitors is\nbroken by Marcie, Karla\u2019s\nmother, who croaks \u201cShe\u2019s\ndead!\u201d as the conversation\nbetween them turns to\nKarla\u2019s sister. Karla\nbursts into uncontrollable\nlaughter, while Don stands\nawkwardly, unsure of how\nto respond. The timing of\nher mother\u2019s comment\ntickles Karla, despite the\ntragedy of the situation.\nGallows humour is a way\nfor Karla to deal with the\npain, pain which bursts\nthrough the surface and\nreveals itself when, much\nlater, she talks about her\nsister\u2019s death with her\nmother.\nIndeed, in the midst of\nKarla and Don\u2019s outwardly witty conversations and\nflippant lines, we learn of\nthe difficulties that each\nis in, and how complementary these problems\nare. Karla is poor and just\nstarting out, but confident\nand self-assured in the\ndirection she will go. Don\nmade his fortune from a\ntech start-up that he has\nno personal interest in,\nsuggested by his wife\nwho is about to leave him.\nHe first appears dressed\n\u201clike a homeless man\u201d\ndespite his wealth, an\noutward manifestation\nof the mess his life is in,\nand talks with an air of\nresignation. As might be\nexpected, Karla\u2019s prickly\nnature hides a backstory\n\u2013 one that is revealed\nwhen Marcie awakes, and\nputs her down with every\ncomment she makes.\nAs with any romantic\ncomedy, two characters\nthat are initially antagonistic must end up\ntogether. Karla reveals\na moment of weakness\nbeing upset at how her\nmother treats her and her\nsister\u2019s death, and Don\u2019s\ntender response suddenly\nexplodes into one of the\nmost visual and ludicrous\nsex scenes I have seen on\nstage. While slightly un-necessary, it was certainly\n(perhaps awkwardly)\nfunny, and took the connection between them to\na graphic, symbolic level.\nThis connection that\nDon and Karla experience\nis a shared acknowledgement of each other\u2019s\nsuffering, that despite\ntheir very different life\ncircumstances, they are\nbrought together in shared\ngrief for their mothers\u2019\nsuffering. What the play\ndoes well is that it does\nnot pretend that jokes and\nhumour are so that one can\n\u201csmile through the pain\u201d\n\u2013 it is deeper than that.\nRather, it is an observation\nthat humour is the thread\nthat allows for genuine\nhuman connection, that it\nis a medium for common\nunderstanding. In fact,\nsometimes it might be\ndifficult to distinguish\nhumour from pain. When\nDon\u2019s mother Geena dies,\nhe says tentatively to\nMarcie that he found his\nsituation then \u201cfunny\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d Marcie\nreplies. \u201cWhat you feel is\nrelief that your mother is\ndead, not that it is funny.\u201d\nCariad Lloyd is brilliant\nas Karla, balancing the\nself-assurance of youth\nwith her insecurity, while\ndelivering her comedic\nlines well. Rob Crouch\nis a suitably scruffy Don,\nand carries the mid-life\ncrisis aura well. Kristin\nMilward makes a brilliantly acerbic sick mum,\nand while Cara Chase, as\nGeena, gets only a few\nlines in the play, she does\nher part well. The intimate\nsetting and importance of\ndialogue means that one\u2019s\nexperience could be very\ndependent on the cast, and\nI\u2019m glad to say that this\nsmall cast has delivered\nexcellently. The setting of\nthe Finborough Theatre is\nperfect, a small, intimate\nspace above a pleasant\npub. One almost feels like\nthe audience fits into the\nhospital room, and can\npartake in the interactions\nbetween strangers, just as\nhow Don and Karla have.\nThis play is a comedy,\nbut comments on very\nreal issues of city life,\nfrom Don\u2019s son\u2019s drug\nproblems to class differences between the two.\nUltimately it celebrates\nhuman connection \u2013 the\nshared suffering, but\nalso shared laughter. It\nis tender without being\nheavy, hilarious and witty\nwithout being slapstick,\nand definitely worth a\nwatch.\nCariad Lloyd, Kristin Milward, Cara Chase and Rob Crouch in A Funny Thing Happened... // Tristam Kenton\nISSUE 1700\nFELIX\n27\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Gynaecologic Oncology Unit at Memorial Sloan-Kettering\nCancer Center of New York City brings together two unlikely strangers in the morbid setting of their mothers\u2019\ncancer ward, only for them to connect in a way neither expects.\nARTS\nJingjie Cheng\nBooks Editor\nWhere?

Allison and Tasuku Honjo\u2019s research may save many lives\nSCIENCE\nPaulina Rowinska\nScience Writer\nT\nhe 2018\nNobel Prize in\nPhysiology or\nMedicine went\nto James P. Allison and\nTasuku Honjo for the \u201cdiscovery of cancer therapy\nby inhibition of negative\nimmune regulation.\u201d\nBe it bacteria, virus or\ncancer cell, no foreign\nmolecule can expect a\nwarm welcome to our\nbody. T-cells, a type of\nwhite blood cells, bind\nthemselves to potentially\ndangerous intruders,\nwhich triggers the immune\nsystem to defend us. Additionally, some types of\nproteins accelerate the full\nimmune system response,\nwhile others inhibit it.\nThis way our immune\nsystem attacks threatening\nintruders but leaves our\nown healthy cells alone. A\ntypical war strategy: kill\nenemy soldiers, protect\nours.\nUnfortunately, cancer\nmanages to fool this\nso-called \u2018checkpoint\nsystem\u2019 by pretending\nto be a normal part of\nour body. The latest\nNobel Prize laureates\nindependently proposed\nspecial drugs called\n\u201ccheckpoint inhibitors\u201d,\nwhich suppress proteins\nresponsible for blocking\nour immune system. Now,\nthe immune system gets\na chance to assess cancer\ncells as \u201cnon-self\u201d and\ndestroy them. This way,\nthe body can fight against\ncancer using natural\nmechanisms, with just\na little boost from drugs\nbased on immunotherapy.\nAllison and Honjo\nbring hope to patients\nfor whom none of\nsurgery, radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy would be\navailable, for a variety\nof reasons. Their work\ninspired numerous clinical\ntrials, with successes in\nlung cancer, renal cancer,\nlymphoma and melanoma\n(skin cancer).\nWhilst side effects of\ncheckpoint therapy can\nbe as dangerous and unpleasant as of other cancer\ntreatments, our knowledge\nof autoimmune reactions\nallows us to manage them\nbetter. Current research\nfocuses on explaining and\ntreating these side effects\neven more effectively.\n\u201cCancer kills millions\nof people every year\nand is one of humanity\u2019s\ngreatest health challenges.\nBy stimulating the ability\nof our immune system to\nattack tumour cells, this\nyear\u2019s Nobel Prize laureates have established an\nentirely new principle for\ncancer therapy\u201d, we can\nread at the Nobel Prize\nofficial Twitter account.\nDid we find \u2018the cure\u2019\nfor cancer? Probably not.\nBut Allison and Honjo\u2019s\nresearch can definitely\nsave hundreds of lives.\nCan\u2019t Stop, Won\u2019t Stop: Science on why we can\u2019t stop\neating\nSCIENCE\nSarah Wong\nScience Writer\nI\nlied to myself again:\n\u201cI will just have one\nmore,\u201d as I engulfed\nthe whole bag of\ncrisps. Interestingly, this\ngluttonous behaviour can\nbe explained by science,\nso we are not to be blamed\nentirely.\nIn the brain, there\nare two main types of\nneurones that impact our\nappetite in the hypothal-amus: those that make us\ncrave food (orexigenic),\nand the other suppresses\nthis desire (anorexigenic).\nAn example of orexigenic\nneurones would be the\ncells expressing proopi-omelanocortin (POMC),\nwhich is a stress-related\ngene; and an example\nof anorexigenic neuron\nwould be agouti-related\nprotein (AgRP), where\nit is known that agou-ti-expressing mice are\ngenerally obese. These\nnerve cells respond to\nnutrient and hormonal\nsignal (e.g. leptin) and\ntogether, the two systems\nwork together to regulate\nappetite, energy expenditure and importantly, body\nweight. Yet, we don\u2019t have\na complete understanding\nof the interplay of these\nneurons and a recent study\npublished in Proceedings\nof the National Academy\nof Sciences aimed to shed\nlight into this question,\nliterally.\nUsing optogenetic\ntechniques, neurones\nwere activated using\nlight. Together with\nneural activity mapping\nand brain transparency\nvisualisation techniques,\nthe researchers at the\nUniversity of Michigan\ndemonstrated the ano-rexigenic and orexigenic\nnature of neurons that\nexpress POMC or AgRP\nrespectively.\nIn the study, the mice\nwith activated POMC\nneurones stopped eating\nthough they were starved\n4 hours before feeding.\nPOMC is a gene that\ncodes for stress hormones,\ntherefore it makes as\nmuch sense as eating\nwould probably be the last\nthing we want to do when\nwe face a life-threatening\nsituation. However, if\nboth AgRP and POMC\nneurones were activated,\nthe group of mice increased food intake. This\nsuggests the neurons that\nput the brakes on eating\nare overridden by the\nneurones that promote\neating. In other words, the\n\u2018I must eat more\u2019 mechanism is stronger than\nthe \u2018I think I will stop\u2019\nmechanism \u2013 that\u2019s why\nwe keep eating when we\nare full.\nTo explore how this\nwas brought about, the\nscientists visualised the\nneuronal network in the\nbrain that received protein\nsignals from POMC and\nAgRP neurones. Results\nshowed that the two\nsystems have a different\nneuronal activation\npattern, in which the\ninsatiable mouse group\nhas a much broader and\nwider response area in\nthe brain compared to the\ngroup where anorexigenic\nneurones were activated.\nTo investigate potential\nmechanism of how\nthe change of appetite\nis brought about, the\nscientists gave the mice\nnaloxone, a drug that\nblocks opioid receptors.\nResults suggest the effect\nof increased food intake is\nlikely to be mediated by\nthe opioid receptor-sig-nalling system, the same\nsystem that regulates\nsodium appetite (craving\nsalty food) and aids in\nregulating pain.\nAll these interesting\nfindings certainly help\nincrease our understanding of the appetite\ncontrol mechanisms,\nwhich could potentially\ntarget the pathway to\nup- or down-regulate our\nappetite, thereby treating\nissues like obesity. Whilst\nthe use of pharmacologic\ntreatment (naloxone) in\nthe experiment suggested\na slight possibility to\ntranslate this knowledge\ninto a medical treatment,\nthe difference in mice\nand men means that\nfactors such as stress and\nemotions were not in-vestigated. Furthermore,\nas mentioned, the opioid\nreceptor signalling system\nis also involved in other\nimportant features, hence,\na \u2018magic pill\u2019 is not likely\nto be ready soon. Longterm effects should also\nbe investigated before\nmaking any therapeutic\nclaims.\nTo conclude, scientists have shown that\nover-eating is caused by\nan overpowering signal\nfrom the \u2018please eat\nmore\u2019 neurones, which,\nin mice can be inhibited\nby drugs. However, more\nwork needs to be done to\nunderstand the topic, as\nhumans are greatly different from mice, especially\nin terms of psychology\nand experiences to social\ntriggers. In the meantime,\nI guess willpower is all\nwe have to stop us from\novereating.\nWhy do we overeat so regularly? //Tanvir Logani\nSCIENCE\nFRIDAY, 12TH\nOCTOBER, 2018 FELIX\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n13\nMoths at Midnight\nRecent research from the University of York gives an insight into the night-time pollination activities of moths. A\npollination service that may be of great ecological importance, which has been overlooked, until now.\nW\ne all know\nthat pollination is an\ninvaluable\nprocess, critical for both\nthe maintenance of ecosystems and continued\nagricultural production.\nWith growing pressure\non agriculture to sustain\nthe inflating human\npopulation, the role of\npollinators is becoming\nincreasingly important.\nIn spite of global declines\nacross many pollinating\ninsect species, the conservation discussion tends\nto focus on day-time pol-linators, in particular the\nplight of bees. However,\nrecent research from the\nUniversity of York has\ndemonstrated that the\nnight-time activities of\nmoths may play a much\ngreater role in pollination\nthat we had previously\nthought.\nDue to the technical\nchallenges of observing\nnocturnal animals, moths\nare relatively understudied compared to day-time\npollinator species. In the\nUniversity of York study,\nresearchers genetically\nanalysed pollen found\non moths to characterise\npreviously unstudied\nplant-moth interactions\nand identify pollen-trans-port networks within a\nUK agrosystem. In so\ndoing they identified\nmany plants that were not\npreviously thought to be\npollinated by moths and\nfound that moths pollinate\na number of important\nagricultural crops. These\ninclude potato, soya bean\nand oil-seed rape. Many\nmoth-pollinated plant\nspecies are also known to\nbe pollinated by day-time\ninsects. This may confer\na selective advantage\nfor these plant species if\ncurrent pollinator declines\ncontinue.\nMoth pollinators tend\nto travel greater distances\nwhilst foraging compared\nto their day-time coun-terparts. Consequentially,\nthey may facilitate\nplant-geneflow across a\nlandscape and prevent\nthe deleterious effects of\ninbreeding. The maintenance of genetic diversity\nthrough geneflow has\nimportant implications\nfor a species evolution\nand may improve survival\nunder future perturbations\nin the environment \u2013 of\nparticular note, climate\nchange.\nThe contribution of\nmoths to pollination\nservices has previously\nbeen understudied.\nHowever, using genetic\nanalyses this study has\nidentified them as globally\nrelevant pollinators.\nConsequentially, their\nconservation is of great\nimportance, especially in\nthe face of ongoing global\ndeclines in the numbers\nof pollinating insects. The\ntotal number of moths in\nthe UK is estimated to\nhave decreased by around\n30% since 1968, this has\npartly been attributed to\nhabitat losses, light pollution and use of pesticides.\nThe Univeristy of York\nstudy goes some way to\nprove that when discussing important pollinators\nfor the maintenance of\nagricultural production,\nwe should include moths,\nand therefore take action\nto prevent their further\ndecline.\nThe ICESat2 // NASA\nSCIENCE\nPhotini Knoyle\nScience Writer\nICESat-2,NASA\u2019snewsatellitetomeasurethemelting\nof ice\nO\nn Saturday\nthe 15th of\nS e p t e m b e r ,\nN A S A\nlaunched their newest\nlaser, the ICESat-2, which\nstands for \u201cIce, Cloud and\nland Elevation Satellite\u201d.\nIn orbit 500 km above our\nheads, the satellite\u2019s main\nmission is to measure the\nalarming evolution of ice\nmelting in the poles.\nSince 2009 and\nthe end of the first mission\nof ICESat, NASA had\nno spacecraft instrument\ncapable of providing\ninformation such as the\nthickness of the ice in\nGreenland and the Antarctic. On board of the half a\ntonne satellite, two lasers,\none of replacement, were\ninstalled. Each laser is\ndivided into six beams\nto follow as closely as\npossible the slope of the\nsurface of Earth. With\n10,000 laser pulses per\nsecond, measurements\nwill be taken every 70 centimetres on the trajectory\nof the satellite. Thanks\nto these very precise\ndata, NASA aims \u201cto\nestimate the annual height\nchange of Greenland and\nAntarctic ice sheets to\nwithin 4 millimetres \u2013 the\nwidth of a No. 2 pencil.\u201d\nICESat-2 records the time\ntaken by the laser beams\nto reach the Earth and to\ncome back to the satellite\nat a very precise spatial\nlocation. Scientists are\nthen able to calculate the\nheight of forests, glaciers\nand sea ice.\nSuch devices\nare urgently required in\ntoday\u2019s global warming\nsituation. The Arctic Sea\nIce has indeed reached its\nsmallest 2018 summertime surface area (4.59\nmillion square kilometres)\non September 23rd. This\nlayer of frozen water\nfloating above the Arctic\nOcean extends during\nwintertime and naturally\nshrinks during summer.\nHowever, since the 1970s,\nthe Arctic Sea Ice rapidly\nreduced by 54 000 square\nkilometres each year,\ngoing from 7.01 million\nsquare kilometres in 1980\nto only 2.91 square kilometres in 2012!

Hundreds\nof millions of inhabitants\nliving on coastal land are\nunder the threat of sea\nlevel rising! The future\nmeasurements provided\nby ICESat-2 will supply\nmore details to the world\u2019s\nleaders to orientate their\npolicies in favour of sustainable development and\ntake action to prevent the\nEarth\u2019s temperature from\nrising by more than 1.5\u00b0C\nby 2022.\nSCIENCE\nMarie Jones\nScience Writer\nArctic ice extent reached a 2018 summertime minimum\non September 23rd\n// National Snow and Ice Data Centre\n\n"

These\nyearly prizes are awarded to those who make\nsignificant contributions\nin several categories outlined in the will of Alfred\nNobel, with the three in\nscience being given to\nMedicine, Physics and\nChemistry. So, this week\nFelix Science will give\nyou a rundown of the\nthree science winners so\nyou can sound cool and\nclever at welcome drinks.\nThe week began with\nthe announcement of the\nNobel in Physiology and\nMedicine, which was\nawarded to James Allison\nand Tasuku Honjo for\nthe discovery of cancer\ntherapy by inhibition of\nnegative immune regu-lation, more commonly\nknown as immunotherapy.\nThe immune system is a\npowerful tool, and so directing it towards cancer\ntherapy has been the\ndream of many scientists\nfor a long time. However,\nat that time the systems\nin place to regulate the\nimmune system were\nstill a bit of a mystery.\nJames Allison\u2019s work\nfocused on the catchily\nnamed CTLA-4, a protein\ninvolved in reducing\nT-Cell function. They\ndeveloped an antibody\nthat binds to this protein,\ninhibiting it and therefore\nincreasing the immune\nresponse to a tumour. The\nresults in mice were im-pressive, but many companies were reluctant to\ntry it, as playing with the\nimmune system is always\nrisky business. However,\neventually one company\nwas brave enough, and\nthis finally led to the development of Yervoy, an\nimmunotherapy antibody\nfor melanoma.\nThe second half of the\nprize goes to the discovery\nof PD-1, byTasuku Honjo.\nThis protein is similar in\nfunction to CTLA-4, and\nacts as another regulatory\nsystem to keep T-cells in\ncheck. Honjo also developed an antibody for this\nprotein, and nowadays\nthere are several oncology\ntreatments based on PD-1\nin the clinic. Immunotherapy has been a revolution\nin cancer treatment and\nhas saved the lives of\nmany people. What is\nequally exciting however\nis that this revolution is\nstill going. There are still\npapers coming out on this\nsubject, and only time will\ntell how these will impact\nhow we treat cancer.\nThis year\u2019s Physics\nNobel went to \u2018Advances\nin Laser Physics\u2019 and\nwas split, with one half\ngoing to Arthur Ashkin\nfor the development of\noptical tweezers, and the\nother half going to G\u00e9rard\nMourou and Donna\nStrickland for their work\nin the development of\nhigh-intensity ultra-short\nlaser pulses.\nOptical tweezers are\na somewhat futuristic\nsounding tool that utilise\nlasers to trap and manipulate particles. These take\nadvantage of the ability\nof light to exert force or\nradiation pressure on an\nobject, and it was with the\nadvent of lasers that the\nability to use this force\nbecame a possibility.\nOptical tweezers have\nbeen shown to be able\nto move atoms, whole\ncells, and even organelles\nwithin a cell, and they\nhave a myriad of uses\nthroughout science. The\nother half of the Nobel\nwent to the generation of\nhigh-intensity ultra-short\nlaser pulses by Mourou\nand Strickland. Whilst this\nsounds a lot less exciting\non the surface, they are\nvital for laser eye surgery\nand in laser machining.\nMourou and Strickland\ncreated chirped pulse\namplification by stretching the pulse in time and\nreducing the peak power,\nthen amplifying the pulse ,\nand finally recompressing\nthe pulse in time resulting\nin large power pulses. This\nmeant that pulsed laser\ndevices became smaller\nand cheaper and opened\nup new areas of physics\nand led to development of\ncorrective eye surgery.\nDonna Strickland is the\nthird woman ever to win\nthe Nobel in physics, and\nher win has reignited the\ndebate about recognising\nwomen in science. She is\ncurrently not a full professor and, until roughly\n90 minutes after the prize\nwas announced, she didn\u2019t\nhave a Wikipedia page\nas she wasn\u2019t deemed\nnoteworthy enough.\nConsidering \u2018Dusty the\nKlepto Kitty\u2019 made the\ncut, that reason seems to\nbe misjudged.\nFinally, the Chemistry\nNobel prize was an-nounced, and this year half\nwent to Frances Arnold\nfor directed evolution of\nenzymes, and the other\nhalf to George P. Smith\nand Sir Gregory P. Winter\nfor the phage display of\nantibodies and peptides.\nDonna Strickland is only the third woman to earn the Nobel Prize in physics // Wikimedia\nSCIENCE\nLucy Rowlands\nScience Writer\n\u201cStrickland\nis the third\nwoman ever to\nwin the Nobel\nin physics\u201d\n\u201cDirecting\nthe immune\nsystem\ntowards cancer\ntherapy has\nbeen the\ndream of many\nscientists\u201d\nISSUE 1700\nFELIX\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n15\nNow, some of the more\nkeen-eyed readers might\nbe thinking \u2018hang on, that\nsounds an awful lot like\nbiology\u2019, but since there\u2019s\nno prize for biology,\nthe major contributions\nin areas like chemical\nbiology get lumped into\nthe chemistry prize.\nDirected evolution\nof enzymes applies\nevolutionary ideas to\nwas able to function in a\nsolvent system that would\nhave destroyed the starting\nenzyme. Since then there\nhave been a great many\nother enzymes devel-oped, including modified\nlipases that break down\nfat in laundry detergents.\nArnold\u2019s own spinout\ncompany develops biope-sticides through directed\nevolution of enzymes.\nproducing enzymes that\ncan do things that natural\nenzymes cannot. This\ninvolves taking enzymes\nand inducing a series of\nrandom mutations, and\nthen weeding out the ones\nthat are better at doing\nwhat you want and then\ndoing the whole thing all\nover again. The original\nwork tested this by producing an enzyme that\nThe rest of the prize is\nfor the related technique\nof phage display. This\nuses bacteriophages, a\nvirus that infects bacteria,\nto produce antibodies.\nBacteriophages display\nproteins on their surface,\nand Smith worked out that\nthey could produce any\nprotein when the correct\ngene was inserted. Winters\nthen used an evolutionary\nmethod like the one developed byArnold to produce\nantibody-based drugs.\nToday there are several\nantibody-based drugs on\nthe market, and the list is\ngrowing every day.\nPortraits of the 2018 Nobel Prize Laureates.

Bad news\nfor regular followers\nof Grumpy Bastard\u2019s\ncolumn: they\u2019ve had\nto take the week off to\nrecover from a ruptured\nspleen, suffered supposedly due to the cumulative\ntraumas of Freshers\u2019\nWeek, the uncommonly\npleasant weather, and\nthe first advent calendars\ngoing on sale. That\u2019s how\nthey were found, so I hear\n\u2013 slumped over the desk,\nhaving just penned the\nfinal word of their latest\ncolumn, with their usual\n\u201ccreative associates\u201d\n(John Smith and Jack\nDaniels) arranged around\nthem solemnly like\nsome bizarre Neolithic\nmonument to Middle\nEngland. But fear not, for\nI have been tasked with\nproviding the allotted 600\nwords of bile this week;\nyes, the powers that be\nin Felix, in their infinite\ncowardice, have decided\nthat \u201cbalance\u201d is needed\nin the form of a Grumpy\nGramsci to replace\nGrumpy Bastard [Ed.: I\ndidn\u2019t get the Gramsci bit\neither].\nOf course, avid readers\nof Felix will be aware that\nGrumpy Bastard is the\nbalance, a lone voice of\n\u201csanity\u201d (loosely defined)\nin a rag otherwise corrupted by us, the Hard\nLeft. Like all good hacks,\nI know which way the\nwind is blowing, and I\nknow who\u2019s signing my\npaychecks. These days,\neveryone in Felix is an\nEdgy Marxist, and I\u2019m\ncertainly not one to miss\na good bandwagon \u2013 I\u2019ll\ntote my tote and spoil my\nvote with the best of them.\nThe mistake that ol\u2019\nGB makes, though, is in\nthinking that this state of\naffairs extends beyond\nthe confines of the Felix\noffice. In a shocking rev-elation, I can reveal that\nImperial College is hardly\na hotbed of radicalism,\ndespite what previous\ncolumns would have\nyou think. In truth, the\nFelix office is an oasis of\nIdeological CorrectnessTM\nin an otherwise apathetic\ndesert. The response that\ntypically greets those\nleftists among us when we\nmention politics is really\nmuch the same as the\none received by righties:\nstony-faced silence. You\nwould expect that this\nwould be familiar even\nto loyal readers of Felix,\nmany of whom will have\nhad to endure mind-numb-ing political conversations\nwith the American stoner\nguy or that smug ginger\nprick at Meet the Writers\nevents.\nI\u2019ll concede that what\nfew leftists there are tend\nto be a bit more visible on\ncampus these days. You\ncan sometimes find all\nfive of us outside the main\nentrance or the library,\nclutching our chosen\ninstruments of hate \u2013 the\nmegaphone, the leaflet,\neven (dare I say it?) the\nbox of chalk. Truly these\nare the end times, when a\nstudent can\u2019t even venture\nfrom the library to the JCR\nfor fear of being engaged\nin dreaded human inter-action. It\u2019s this flouting\nof convention \u2013 and\nthere can be none more\ngrave than daring to talk\nto someone on London\u2019s\nstreets \u2013 that makes\nus leftists so goddamn\ndangerous. Just take a\nlook at us, with our hair,\nand our piercings, and\nour second-hand books;\nwe represent nothing less\nthan the decay of our\nonce-great nation\u2019s moral\nfibre. Maybe we ought to\njust grow up, wear some\nnormal glasses and buy\na fucking Kindle like\neveryone else.\nOr maybe not. I don\u2019t\nknow about you, dear\nreader, but I don\u2019t miss\nthe days of old, where\nwomen weren\u2019t allowed\nin the Union Bar. Bleeding-heart liberal Stewart\nLee once described political correctness as a kind\nof institutionalised polite-ness, and I think that fits\n\u2013 it ought to be a courtesy,\na sign of our respect\nfor others, to consider\n\u201cDespite\ntheir original\npayment of\n\u00a340, students\nnow must pay\na subscription\nof \u00a330 yearly\u201d\ncarefully the words we\nchoose and the tone we\nuse. After all, it\u2019s hardly\nan assault on campus\nfreedom to be upbraided\nfor joining some all-male\nBullingdon-rejects club.\nIt seems, then, that I\u2019m\nsigning off on a disappointingly earnest note.\nPerhaps I\u2019ve just spent\ntoo much time down in\nthe West Basement echo\nchamber, but I for one\nwould welcome a bit\nmore action on campus.\nThe green shoots of\nprogress are there; for the\nfirst time in a long time,\npolitical discourse at\nImperial seems to extend\nbeyond \u201cuhh\u2026maybe let\nmachines run things?\u201d.\nSo raise a glass in toast,\ncomrades, and hoist the\nflag on high: long live\nthe People\u2019s Republic of\nSouth Kensington!\nHenry Hart accuses Sport Imperial of fraud\nIn light of the recent contract changes to the terms of use of Ethos, comment writer Henry\nHart accuses Sport Imperial of acting fraudulently\nFraud: Wrongful\nOR criminal deception\nintended to result in\nfinancial or personal gain.\nAt least that\u2019s the definition google gives me. It\nperfectly describes the situation that Sport Imperial\nCOMMENT\nHenry Hart\nComment Writer\nhas created with its new\nscheme to increase Ethos\nfees to \u00a330 a year. Yes, I\ncould hardly help but hear\nyou screaming through the\npage that this is an incredibly good deal for students\n- I agree. However, it was\nnot the deal I made when\nI handed over my \u00a340\nfor use of Ethos for the\nentirety of my degree.\nCharge freshers this new\nreasonable fee but Sport\nImperial are not entitled to\nvoid their contract with all\nprevious gym users. That\nis fraud.\nI was so astounded at\nthis recent revelation, such\nthat I could not believe\nthat Sport Imperial would\ncommit fraud, that I went\nto the Sport Imperial\nstand at Freshers\u2019 fair and\nasked the representative\nto clarify the situation. To\nmy shock he confirmed\nthat even people who\nhad paid the \u00a340 would\nbe required to pay \u00a330\na year for gym access.\nHe then qualified this by\nsaying that Sport Imperial\nhad consulted with the\nrelevant student bodies,\nwhatever that means, and\nthat the gym facilities\nhad been improved. Well\nthat\u2019s all very well and\ngood, but that DOES\nNOT give you the right\nto void your contract with\nme or any other student\nwho was conveniently left\nout of this \u2018consultation\u2019.\nAnd it was a contract.\nAside from the legality\nsurrounding the \u2018verbal\ncontracts\u2019, a true Englishman\u2019s word is his bond,\nand for Sport Imperial to\ncast that principle aside\nshames this organisation\nand this University. I am\ndisgusted that the union is\ncondoning fraud.\n\n"

On the few\noccasions the continent\nwas reported by our\nnews organisations, its\nnations were painted as\npermanently failed states\nravaged by civil war, dictators and death squads.\nThis picture ignores the\ndeep changes that the\nregion has experienced\nsince the late 80s, when\nthe regimes that dominated the region started to\ncrumble, a combination\nof indigenous democratic\nrevolts against the despotic rulers and the loss\nof support for said rulers\nof successive American\nadministrations, that had\npropped up criminals\nlike Pinochet or R\u00edos\nMontt to curb the Soviet\ninfluence in the region\n(as one President of the\nUSA put it: \u201cThey may be\nbastards, but they\u2019re our\nbastards.\u201d).\nBrazil is a textbook\nexample of this phenom-enon. After the military\ndictatorship was toppled\nin 1985, the leftist government of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula\nda Silva\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party\ninstituted policies like the\nBolsa Fam\u00edlia, that gave financial benefits to poorest\nelements of society in\nreturn for providing their\nsons and daughters school\neducation and ensuring\nthat they were vaccinated.\nThus, a new middle class\narose for the first time in\nthe history of the country,\nto the chagrin of the\nBrazilian elites, who had\nbenefitted for centuries\nfrom the extreme ine-quality. It should also be\nremembered that class and\nrace in Brazil are strongly\ncorrelated: the whiter\nyour skin looks, the more\nlikely you are to belong to\nthe well-off class.\nThe economic transformation was accompanied\nby a religious one. Brazil,\nhistorically a uniformly\nCatholic country, became\nfertile ground for the\nAmerican branches\nof Protestantism that\nadvocate the prosperity\ngospel (which are part\nof the wider Evangelical\nmovement in the USA),\na theology that states that\nit is God\u2019s will to acquire\nwealth. The Evangelicals\nhave gone from being\nstatistically insignificant\nto forming 20% of the\nBrazilian population in\n2010.\nIn the past 10 years,\nthe worldwide economic\ndownturn has hit Brazil\npretty badly. The formerly\nemergent economy was in\nrecession between 2014\nand 2016. The difficult\neconomic situation lead to\nthe impeachment of Dilma\nRousseff, Lula\u2019s successor at the highest office of\nthe country, on charges of\ncorruption. The process\nwas seen as a farce by her\nsupporters, who claimed\nthat Rousseff had been\nunfairly tried and had\nbeen expelled from the\npresidency by the actions\nof obscure interest groups.\nLula himself is now in\nprison, having been found\nguilty of corruption in\na trial that many don\u2019t\nconsider fair. With the two\nbiggest stalwarts of the\nleft discredited, the figure\nof Jair Bolsonaro started\nto rise.\nHow can Bolsonaro\nbe described? Well, let\nhis statements speak for\nthemselves. He said that a\nfemale political opponent\nwas not even worthy of\nbeing raped. He called\nHaitian immigrants \u201cthe\nscum of humanity\u201d. He\nis an ardent admirer of\nchurches. His popularity\npropelled him to the first\nplace in the first round of\nthe presidential election,\nheld last Sunday.\nBolsonaro got 46.03%\nof the vote nationally,\ncrossing the 50% mark\nin the whiter southern\nstates of the country. He\nwas followed distantly by\nWorkers\u2019 Party candidate\nFernando Haddad, as\nLula (who was the only\npolitician able of beating\nBolsonaro according to\nevery major poll) was in-elligible to run due to his\nsentence. Brazilians will\ngo to the polls again on the\nMeet the Brazilian Donald Trump// Wikimedia\n\u201cIn the past\n10 years, the\nworldwide\neconomic\ndownturn\nhas hit Brazil\npretty badly.\u201d\nBrazil\u2019s former military\njunta. In addition to all\nthis, he has been clear in\nhis homophobia, racism,\nsexism and anti-poor\nviews (he is a proponent\nof the forced sterilisation\nof the lower classes, as\nwell as being a noted\nclimate change denialist).\nBolsonaro\u2019s far\nright demagoguery has\nresonated in a country\nplagued by crisis and\nturmoil. He began to rise\nin the polls, forming an\nelectoral coalition of the\nnew upper middle classes,\nthe long-standing elites,\nthe army and the most\nsocially conservative\ngroups in Brazillian\nsociety, usually grouped\naround the Evangelical\n28th of October to choose\nbetween Bolsonaro and\nHaddad in the second\nround of the election.\nBolsonaro is the last\nin a long line of right\nwing demagogues that\nhave arisen everywhere\nin the world due to the\nchallenges brought by\nglobalisation. He is very\nsimilar to the Philippines\u2019\nRodrigo Duterte, who\ninfamously won the\npresidency of his country\non a platform of encouraging the extra-judicial\nkilling of drug dealers. If\n\u201cHow can\nBolsonaro be\ndescribed?\nWell, let his\nstatements\nspeak for\nthemselves.\u201d\none believes his rhetoric,\nBolsonaro will bring the\ncountry back to the time\nof the authoritarian junta.\nHis victory would also\naffect the global fight\nagainst climate change, as\nBolsonaro has proposed\nincreasing the exploitation of the Amazonian\nrainforest, the planet\u2019s\nlargest green expanse.\nThus, it may not be not\nan exaggeration to state\nthat the fate of the world\nwill be decided by the\nBrazilian electorate in two\nweeks. May they choose\nwisely.\n\n"

I\nwas already pumped and\nit was just the first song.\nThe rest of the album\ndelivers many more rap\nfeatures from fantastic\n\u201cI\u2019d hope that\nas the band\nprogresses, we\nsee more of\nthe originality\nthey\u2019ve\nshown us on\nREDUXER.\u201d\nartists and producers like\nPusha T, Goldlink and\nDanny Brown to name a\nfew.\nThe songs I liked from\nRELAXER have only\nbeen improved upon,\nbut it\u2019s the previously\nwishy-washy tracks that\nreally stand as testament\nto alt-J\u2019s ability to regroup\nand rework. \u2018Hit Me Like\nThat Snare\u2019 is one of the\ntracks that is remixed not\nonce but twice on this\nalbum, chaotic and dissonant with Jimi Charles\u2019s\npassionate vocals in\nthe first but smooth and\nfunky with Rejjie Snow\u2019s\nlaid back rapping in the\nsecond. Each are much\nbetter than Joe\u2019s vocals\nin the original. \u2018Adeline\u2019\nwas originally a standard\nsafe alt-J song but here it\u2019s\nbeen morphed into a chill\ntrap banger with an alt-J\ntwist (good name for a\ncocktail?). If that doesn\u2019t\nentice you I don\u2019t know\nwhat will.\nThough each song is\nin that you can always\nrecognize the original.\nThe choruses are usually\nkept, while the verses are\ngiven to a feature. Filling\nthe verse space with a\nrap feature eliminates the\nwatery and directionless\nfeeling the tracks had in\nthe original. All the while\na sweet brew of solid\nbeats and airy instrumentals mix in the background\ngiving the album a unique\nfeel.\nThe album still has\nits problems. I still hate\n\u2018House of the Rising\nSun\u2019, but it can\u2019t be easy\nto turn something that\nbad into something good.\nAlso, the album lacks any\nreal direction or message.\nBut how much can you\nexpect from these artists\nwhen they\u2019re separately\nremixing tracks of an\nalbum they didn\u2019t create.\nREDUXER isn\u2019t really a\nproper album or a serious\nproject, it\u2019s more just a bit\nof fun (done well).\nWhen the album was\ndropped, Joe Newman\nposted on Facebook\ntalking about how excited\nthey were to be working\nwith global hip-hop artists\nwho have influenced them\nso much, and their passion\nshines through. I would\nlove to see more music\nlike this from alt-J, and\nwhile I\u2019m not expecting\nthem to switch entirely\nto hip-hop, I\u2019d hope that\nas the band progresses,\nwe see more of the originality they\u2019ve shown us\non REDUXER. I\u2019m truly\nimpressed by this miracle\ntransformation.\nSo while we wait\nsemi-tentatively for\nwhatever alt-J have\nplanned next, at least we\ncan sit back and enjoy\nthis delicious concoction\nthey\u2019ve served us.\nFELIX\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n24\nMUSIC\nGuthrie Ruby\nMusic Writer\nArtist: alt-J.

While the national media was obsessed\nwith the voting in the\nHouse of Representatives,\nthe jurisprudence of all\nsucceeding constitutional\nrepublics was set. During\nthe nearly five-month\nlame-duck period (yes\nthat was how long it was\nprior to the passing of\nthe 20th\namendment),\nJohn Adams nominated\nand got the Senate to\nconfirm John Marshall as\nthe Chief Justice of the\nUnited States. Thus, despite the Federalists never\nwinning a presidential\nelection again, through\nhis historic judgment in\nMarbury vs Maddison,\nJustice Marshall set forth\nthe precedence of judicial\nreview and ensured that\nthe Federalist viewpoint\nremained at the centre of\nAmerican Government for\nthe next 35 years. To those\nthat think the American\njudiciary suffered because of the fierce battle\nover Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s\nnomination, they are\nunfortunately historically\nignorant. The Supreme\nCourt has always been a\npolitical battle front, and\nit\u2019s high time that the\nDemocrats learned how\nto successfully wage this\nwar.\nSince 1968, the Democrats have only been\nable to nominate and\nsuccessfully confirm four\njustices. During this same\nperiod, Republicans have\nsuccessfully nominated\n15 Justices. Democrats\nhave been losing this\nbattle for the last 50 years,\nwith Republicans not even\npretending to act with any\ndecorum or respect for\nthe rules and traditions\nof the senate. The shear\naudacity of the Republican majority in refusing to\neven give Barack Obama\u2019s\nnominee Merrick Garland\na hearing let alone a vote\non the senate floor, must\nbe recognised for what it\nis \u2013 theft.\nEver since the retirement of Earl Warren, the\nSupreme Court has been\ndeeply conservative, with\nthe odd few exceptions, in\nits judgments. This fa\u00e7ade\nthat Antony Kennedy was\na legitimate swing vote\nneeds to be corrected.\nJustice Kennedy voted\nin favour of Bush in\nBush v Gore, authored\nthe majority opinion in\nCitizens United that legal-ised unlimited corruption\nin American politics and\nvoted to overturn Obamacare. These are only\na sample of the litany of\npartisan decisions Justice\nKennedy has made over\nthe years. With the exception of Justice Souter,\nall Republican appointee\nSupreme Court judges\nhave been far right-wing\nzealots. Justice Kavanaugh is only the latest\nexample.\nRepublicans had no\nqualms in confirming a\nmanwhohasbeencredibly\naccused of attempted rape\nby three individuals. In\n1991, the Senate shamefully belittled another\ncredible accuser of sexual\nharassment, Professor\nAnita Hill, and confirmed\nClarence Thomas. In the\n27 years since, many\nthings have changed in\nsociety. Gay marriage\nhas been legalised, there\nwas an African-American\nPresident and a woman\nwon the popular vote in\na presidential election.\nDespite these historic\nsocial changes, when the\nchoice comes to either believing a credible victim\nof sexual assault or appointing the said accuser\nto the highest court of the\nland, Republicans will\nalways choose the latter.\nRepublican justices\nhave also not attempted to\nhide their many unethical\nbackgrounds and practis-es. Justice Abe Fortas was\nforced to resign from the\ncourt (which enabled the\nConservative wing to gain\ncontrol of the court for the\nfirst time in a generation\n\u2026 and the same control\nwhich it has retained ever\nsince) and faced impeachment due to his continued\nretainer fees of $20,000\nfrom his former client.\nIn today\u2019s day and age,\nwhere Justice Scalia died\nwhile living free of charge\nin the estate of John Poindexter (one of his companies was facing a trial\nin the court) and Justice\nKennedy retiring while\nhis son does business\nwith the Trump family.\nJustice Fortas\u2019 resignation\nbecause of ethical consideration 50 years ago now\npales in comparison to the\nswamp that is the Republican party. Even before\nDr Christine Blasey\nFord\u2019s courageous testi-mony, Brett Kavanaugh\nhad already disqualified\nhimself when he committed perjury by lying\nabout his past actions as\na political apparatchik for\nGeorge W Bush.\nIn the election for President in 2020, whoever\nbecomes the Democratic\nnominee must pass a\nsimple yet groundbreaking litmus test: promise to\npack the court and restore\nbalance. How could the\npresent situation continue\nwhen in this century alone\nthe Democrats have comfortably won the popular\nvote in all but one presidential election, but been\nallowed to confirm two\nSupreme Court judges\ncompared to the Republicans\u2019 four. Nowhere in\nthe American constitution\nis it written that the\nSupreme Court must have\nnine judges, in fact this\nnumber has changed over\nthe years. The constitution sets Congress as the\narbiter for determining the\nsize of the Court, and over\nthe years Congress has\nacted on it. Court packing\nis a hallowed tradition\nthat was common practise\nin the 19th\ncentury. It was\nonly after Franklin D\nRoosevelt\u2019s failed attempt\nto increase the size of the\ncourt in 1937 that court\npacking became a taboo.\nIf Democrats want to\nrestore balance, they must\nnot fear the backlash from\nthe corporatist media, and\nfollow in the lead set forth\nby their greatest ever pres-ident. In Washington, bi-partisanship usually mean\none thing, the common\nman being screwed. Wars\nand increased defence\nspending will always get\nbipartisan support. Giving\nhealthcare to the poor?\nNever. So Democrats must\nnot seek bipartisanship,\nwhen the Republicans\nhave made clear they will\nnever reciprocate. The Republicans removed the filibuster for Supreme Court\nwhen they confirmed\nJustice Gorsuch last year.\nWhen the democrats\nregain control of both\nchambers of Congress and\nthe Presidency, they must\ntake the next step. Get rid\nof the legislative filibuster.\nLeave alone the Supreme\nCourt, all the progressive\ngoals like universal\nhealthcare and protecting\nthe environment can never\novercome a Republican\nfilibuster in the Senate.\nCorrespondingly, the\nDemocrats should pass\na Judicial Reform Bill\nwith a simple majority in\nexpanding the court from\nnine to eleven. And then\nappoint two very young\nliberal judges. Only with\nthis nuclear option will\nRepublicans agree to\ncome to the negotiating\ntable and propose a bipartisan amendment to the\nconstitution that would\nenable every president to\nappoint two, and no more\nthan two, Supreme Court\nappointments or introducing term-limits for judges.\nEither way the status\nquo cannot be allowed to\nremain.\nLady Justice // Wikimedia\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1700\nFELIX\n36\nINVESTMENT icu.investmentsociety@imperial.ac.uk\nINVESTMENT\nXerxes Chong Xian\nInvestment Editor\nWe\u2019ve all heard the\nage-old advice; save up\nfor a rainy day, spend\na little less, invest that\nmoney and have enough\nto retire. Your favourite\ncar, that house in the\ncountryside, that trip to\nthe Maldives you\u2019ve been\nplanning since the days of\neating lunch at your desk.\nThe message is clear,\ninvest for the future. As\nwe meticulously allocate\nfunds to reap returns,\nso do countries through\nsovereign wealth funds\n(SWF).\nSWFs are the\ninvestment funds of\ncountries, which invest\nfor the long-term benefit\nof its economy and\nits citizens. Funds are\nderived from accumulated\ntrade and budget surpluses\nand from the exportation\nof natural resources.\nSources are split between\ncommodity-based and\nnon-commodity-based\nsources. Oil and gas\nforms more than 50%\nof global SWF funding.\nSome countries even\nhave multiple funds to\nmeet specific investment\ngoals of its government.\nAccording to SWF\nInstitute, the 10 largest\nSWFs in the world at time\nof writing consist mainly\nof Middle Eastern and\nAsian funds, except for\nNorway\u2019s Government\nPension Fund. It holds the\ntitle of the largest SWF in\nthe world, having more\nthan $1 trillion of assets\nunder management.\nThe Linaburg-Maduell\nTransparency Index\nmeasures the transparency\nof a fund\u2019s operations\non metrics such as how\ntransparent it is about\nholdings, government\nownership structure,\ninvestment process and\nobjective. Funds are\nranked from 1 to 10,\nInvestment Fund were\nset up to meet the future\nof depleted oil wells,\nstricter environmental\nregulations, and the\nproliferation of cheaper\ngreen-energy alternatives\nthat renders hydrocarbon\nextraction uneconomic.\nMacro-stabilisation\nfunds are designed to\nmitigate the effects of\nthe resource curse, an\neconomic phenomenon\nin resource-rich countries\nthat results in high\ngovernment spending with\nsoaring commodity prices,\nfollowed by austerity\nduring downturns. Money\nis drawn down from these\nfunds to make up for the\nloss of revenue, injecting\nliquidity and smoothing\nout the peaks and troughs\nof government spending.\nThe funds are also used\nto help stabilise the value\nof a country\u2019s currency\nduring macroeconomic\nshocks. For these reasons,\ninvestment horizons are\nshort and involve mainly\nliquid assets.\nPensive reserve funds\ninvest to build capital for\ntheir government\u2019s future\npension obligations.\nAn example would be\nSingapore\u2019s GIC, which\nmanages funds from\nSingapore\u2019s Central\nProvident Fund, a\ncompulsory savings plan\nfor working Singaporeans\nto fund their retirement,\nhealthcare, and housing\nneeds. Returns between\n1% and 5% are guaranteed\nby the government. GIC\nmanages a fixed pool\nof the country\u2019s savings\nand foreign reserves to\ngenerate good long-term\nreturns that beat global\ninflation.\nStrategic funds can\nform part of a country\u2019s\ndomestic economic\npolicies, investing in\nstrategic industries to\nnurture their development,\npromoting growth in the\ndomestic and international\neconomy as well as\nproviding generous\nreturns. They provide key\nearly funding to small\nand medium enterprises\nand may take longer-term\nstakes to facilitate the\ngrowth in later stages\nof the business cycle.\nSome are even pro-active\nmanagers, assisting in\nrestructuring and funding\nof distressed companies.\nWhilst such funds tend\nto have a domestic focus,\nsome have reaped returns\nand dividends to venture\ninto overseas markets.\nSingapore\u2019s Temasek\ninitially managed various\nstate-owned-enterprises\nbut eventually transitioned\ninto a more globally\norientated portfolio with\nstakes in Alibaba and\nStandard Chartered,\nwhile retaining a sizable\ndomestic portfolio. In\nJanuary 2018, Temasek\njoined Google in investing\nin Indonesian ride-hailing\nfirm Go-Jek, which is\npreparing to launch in\nSingapore in October\n2018 to compete with\nMalaysian rival Grab.\nApart from Norway and\nSingapore, several large\nSWFs have been facing\nscrutiny,particularlyfunds\nfrom the Middle East,\nscoring an average of 5\non the transparency index.\nThe lack of transparency\nin these funds\u2019 sizes\nand objectives, coupled\nwith close links to their\ngovernments, have led to\nspeculations of politically\nmotivated investments.\nSWFs can clandestinely\nacquire strategic assets of\nanother country, stealing\nproprietary information,\npatented technology\nand trade secrets. The\nbailout of major U.S\nfinancial firms during the\nglobal financial crises of\n2007-2008 by Asian and\nMiddle Eastern SWFs\nand the subsequent poor\nperformance from these\ninvestments increased\ndebate on investment\nstrategies and put pressure\non managers to avoid\nfurther losses.\nThese funds are\ninstitutional investors with\nlarge sums of capital ready\nto be injected. The range\nof companies they invest\nin adds to the available\npool of capital accessible\nacross the life cycle of\nbusinesses. Savings and\npension funds invest\ncurrent earnings for future\ngenerations, allowing\nindividuals and countries\nto continue participating\nin the domestic and\ninternational economy\nfor years to come. In\ntimes of need, SWFs\nhave aided distressed\ncompanies, both domestic\nand international. Despite\ncriticism, SWFs have their\nplace in the international\ncapital market.\nfrom the non-transparent\nor \u201copaque\u201d to the most\ntransparent.\nSWFs are split into\n4 broad categories;\nsavings, macro-stabilisation, pension\nreserve and strategic\nfunds. They differ in their\ninvestment objectives\nand methodologies,\nsuch as having a short\nor long-term investment\nhorizon, and projected\nliquidity requirements\n(indicating the frequency\nof future withdrawals\nfrom the fund). Each\nfund is split across 4 asset\nclasses; cash, equities,\nfixed-income (bonds) and\nalternative investments\nsuch as private equity,\nhedge funds and real\nestate. In general, funds\nwith longer investment\nhorizons will be heavily\nweighted in equities as\nthe longer time frame\nwould ride out short-term market volatility\nand allow investments\nto bear fruit. Alternative\nassets tend to be found\non funds with longer\nhorizons, requiring longer\nplanning and execution\nto exit profitably. Shorter\ninvestment horizons\nnecessitate a larger\nproportion of liquid\nassets to meet large and\noften unexpected capital\noutflows due to higher\nliquidity requirements.\nMost SWFs are savings\nand macro-stabilisation\nfunds.\nSavings funds preserve\nand grow a country\u2019s\nwealth for the future and\nhave investment horizons\nthat span decades.\nCountries rich in lucrative\nbut inevitably finite\nnatural resources such as\noil, gas, precious metals\nand other commodities,\nchannel revenue from\nsales into savings funds.\nThis ensures future\ngenerations can reap the\nbenefits of a depleted\nor stranded resource.\nSWFs such as the Kuwait\nInvestment Authority\nand Saudi Arabia Public\n\u201cIt holds the\ntitle of the\nlargest SWF\nin the world,\nhaving more\nthan $1 trillion\nof assets under\nmanagement\u201d\nCountries save and invest, just like people // Thinkstock\nInvestments by SWFs in the financial crisis // Thunderbird International Business Review\nA Country\u2019s Piggy Bank\nSpike your\nInterest?\nWrite for us!\nSend your article.\nGet it published.\n\n"

    "content": "A family against the Sicilian Mafia\nAndrea Camilleri, author of the Inspector Montalbano series, writes about a family pit against the Sicilian Mafia\nof the early twentieth century in The Sacco Gang.\nBOOKS\nBayan Al-Bulushi\nBooks Writer\nI\nmagine, if you will,\nSicily of the early\ntwentieth century;\nan island whose\nmain source of income is\nagriculture, its residents\nmainly peasants. Against\nthis backdrop, we are introduced to the five Sacco\nbrothers, who are part of\nan honest, hard-working,\nrecently landed family.\nTheir father, Luigi, has\nmade his money by\nmastering the grafting\nof Pistachio trees. One\nday, they receive a letter\nfrom the Sicilian Mafia,\ndemanding they pay for\ntheir \u2018protection\u2019. Luigi\ncommits an unthinkable\nact: he burns the letter and\nrefuses to surrender to the\ndemand. That is when all\nof the family\u2019s troubles\nbegin.\nThe Sicilian Mafia,\nactive for some time in\ntheir town, has permeated\nthrough the very fabric\nof society, redefining\nits culture and accepted\nnorms. When anyone\nreceives such a letter they\nusually capitulate. Rarely\ndo the Mafia run into\nobstinate fools, and when\nthey do, another letter and\na warning are sent \u2013 such\nas the burning of fields\nor, if that does not yield\na satisfactory result, the\ndeath of a close family\nmember. But the Sacco\nfamily does not succumb\nto the pressure, instead\nresorting to the law at\nevery incident. The police\nare helpless, even shocked\nthat the family would\nnot simply give in to the\ndemands of the Mafia.\nThey essentially offer\nthem no protection and\ncannot prosecute any of\nthe suspects, despite their\nconfidence in the brothers\u2019\nclaims, due to a convenient \u2018lack of evidence\u2019.\nThe family is forced to\ntake measures to ensure\ntheir safety, moving out of\nthe countryside to a nearby\ntown, arming themselves\nto the teeth during every\nvisit to their fields.\nHowever, matters soon\ntake a turn for the worse\nwith the Mafia. Viewing\nthe Sacco\u2019s defiance an\nintolerable offence, they\ntry to engineer events such\nthat the Sacco brothers\nare convicted of crimes\nthey themselves commit-ted. Soon the situation\nbecomes so unbearable\nthat some of the brothers\nbecome fugitives.\nWith the political\nchanges occurring in Italy,\nthe brothers hope that the\nnew Fascist government\nof Mussolini would\nwage a war against the\nMafia. An unlikely event,\nsince some of the Mafia\nmembers were big donors\nto the party, that comes to\npass because of a fallout\nbetween the two. It is\nsoon clear, however, that\nthe new Prefect will stop\nat nothing to apprehend\nthe Mafia, even those who\nactively fought against it\nlike the Sacco brothers.\nTheir safety is compromised further and there is\nno recourse for them but\nto hand themselves in.\nThe narrative takes on,\nat times, a biographical\nnature, using excerpts\nof one of the brothers\u2019\nwritings to expound on\nthe events, which are\nbased on a true story. The\nfirst half of the novel was\na thrilling page-turner; I\nwas so engrossed in the\nSaccos\u2019 struggle and their\nuncertain future. The latter\nhalf though was not nearly\nas intriguing; it mainly\ndealt with the arrest, trial\nand imprisonment of three\nof the brothers.\nThe setting of the novel\nwas what first drew me\nto it, and, in that respect,\nit did not disappoint. The\nlifestyle, culture, and\nsudden political upheavals serve as anchors that\ndo not totally overshadow\nthe story itself. It was an\ninteresting insight into\nSicily of the 1920s and the\nculture of the Mafia, which\nwas not extinguished by\nthe imprisonment of most\nof their members during\nthe Fascist era. Camilleri\nuses a quote from A\nHistory of Sicily to explain\nthis: \u201cHad the Mafia been\nan association instead of a\nway of life, [the Prefect]\nmight have been able to\nsuppress it for a while,\nbut its complex social\nand economic causes\ncould never be removed\nin such a short amount of\ntime, and using only such\nmethods.\u201d\nCamilleri\u2019s writing\nleaves much to be desired.\nHis attempt at transforming the true historical\nevents into a story failed,\nin my opinion. Instead,\nit took the tone of a reference text almost, especially towards the middle\nand the end. I believe\nthat, were Camilleri not\na big name thanks to his\nInspector Montalbano\nseries (which I haven\u2019t yet\nread), this novel would\nnot have been translated\ninto English. Suffice it to\nsay that, by the end of the\nbook, I was less than enthusiastic at the prospect\nof a foray into his most\nfamous works.\nAndrea Camilleri // Fabrizio Villa\nBOOKS\nFRIDAY, 12TH\nOCTOBER, 2018 FELIX\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n29\n\u201cThe first\nhalf of the\nnovel was a\nthrilling page-turner; I was\nso engrossed\nin the Saccos\u2019\nstruggle and\ntheir uncertain\nfuture\u201d\n\n"

This is why in\nmid-September England\ntook on Spain and Switzerland in quick-succession,\nlosing to Spain 2-1 in their\nfirst game of the Nations\nLeague whilst beating the\nSwiss 1-0 in a friendly\nrather than playing their\nsecond Nations League\nmatch.\nAfter all the games\nhave been played, each\ngroup-winner (excluding\nthose in League A) is\nautomatically promoted\nto the league above them,\nand each group-loser (ex-cluding those in League\nD) is relegated to the\n\u201cDue to\nwinter venue\nrestrictions,\na group in\nLeague C\ncould contain\na maximum\nof two of\nthese teams:\nNorway,\nFinland,\nEstonia, and\nLithuania\u201d\n\u201cThe rankings\nare based on\nposition in the\ngroup then\npoints, goal\ndifference,\ngoals scored,\naway goals\nscored, wins,\naway wins,\ndisciplinary\npoints,\nand finally\ncoefficient\nranking\u201d\nleague below them for the\nnext tournament.\nAdditionally, the four\ngroup-winners of League\nA will qualify for the\nNations League finals next\nJune. This will be played\nin a knockout format\nwith the two semi-final\npairings selected from an\nopen draw and the first-round matches followed\nby a third-place place-off\nand a grand final to crown\nthe first winners of the\nUEFA Nations League.\nwith a capacity of at least\n30,000 and located in the\nsame host city, or at least\nwithin 150km of each\nother.\nThe tournament is\nplayed over the months\nof September-November\nin even-numbered years,\nwith the finals being held\nin June of the following\nodd-numbered year.\nSo how does this fit\ninto qualifying for the\n2020 Euros?\nWell, European qualifying will go ahead as\nnormal during March-November 2019 with the\nwinner and runner-up of\n10 groups qualifying for\nthe Euros, filling 20 of\nthe available 24 places in\nthe final tournament. The\nNations League is used to\nfill the final 4 places, with\nthe play-offs taking place\nin March 2020.\nThe 4 highest-ranked\nteams in each league of\nthe Nations League that\nThe 2020 UEFA leagues and groups. // UEFA NATIONS LEAGUE\ndo not qualify via the\nofficial qualifying will be\nThe competition sees\nthe 55 UEFA national\nteams divided into 4\ndivisions (the \u201cleagues\u201d),\nbased on their UEFA\nNational Team Coefficient\nRankings (England are\ncurrently ranked 7th). Due\nto the awkward number of\nteams under the UEFA\numbrella, there are 12\nteams in Leagues A & B,\nThe finals will be hosted\nby a randomly selected\nbidding nation from\nthis final quartet. UEFA\nannounced in March\nthat Italy, Poland, and\nPortugal had expressed an\ninterest in bidding before\nthe August deadline, so as\nall three of these teams are\nin the same group (3) in\nLeague A it is likely that\nthe winner of Group 3 will\nhost the finals provided\ntheir bids fulfilled the\ncriteria outlined by\nUEFA. This includes the\npreference for the finals to\nbe played in two stadiums\nput into 4 separate knockouts with the winner of\neach 2 game knockout\nsecuring one of the final 4\nplaces at the Euros. In the\ncase that there are fewer\nthan 4 teams in a league\nthat do not qualify for the\nEuros, the highest-ranked\nremaining team will be\nentered into that knockout.\nThe highest-ranked\nteam in each of the\nsemi-finals will host the\nmatch, with the host of\nthe final for each of the 4\nplay-offs determined by a\ndraw.\nThe rankings are based\non position in the group\nthen points, goal differ-ence, goals scored, away\ngoals scored, wins, away\nwins, disciplinary points,\nand finally coefficient\nranking.\nDoes that all make\nsense?

Following\na season in which both\nHamilton and Vettel have\nbeen closely matched\nthroughout this is a bitter\npill to swallow for Ferrari.\nFollowing the first 10\nraces where a maximum\nof 250 points were on\noffer only 8 points separated the drivers with\nVettel barely ahead. This\nwas indicative of an\nenthralling contest where\nthe title battle swung one\nway then the next with\nplenty of surprise results\nalong the way. This had\nbeen by far the most\ninteresting Championship\nbattle for nearly a decade\nwith both drivers aiming\nfor their 5th world title.\nHowever, Hamilton has\noutscored Vettel by 75\npoints in the last 7 races\nand turned an 8-point\ndeficit into a massive\n67-point advantage with\nonly 4 races remaining.\nHe can now wrap up the\nChampionship at the next\nGrand Prix in the USA.\nThis would have been unthinkable even a couple of\nmonths ago. So how have\nwe got to this point?\nFerrari and Vettel have\nsimply made too many\nerrors in a contest of this\nnature with the margins so\nfine. It has been a decade\nsince Ferrari last won\na Championship battle\nwhilst Mercedes have won\nevery title since 2014.\nMercedes has become\na well-oiled winning\nmachine, demonstrated by\ntheir use of team orders\nin Russia to ask Bottas,\nHamilton\u2019s teammate,\nto move over so that\nHamilton could win the\nrace and further extend\nhis lead over Vettel. Vettel\nhimself has made significant errors throughout the\nChampionship including\nat the German Grand Prix\nwhere he spun off out of\nthe race whilst leading, in\nItaly where he defended\nhis position too hard and\nwas sent into a spin ending\nup at the back of the field\nand in Japan where he\ntried to dive down the\ninside Verstappen which\nyet again saw him spun\naround and at the back\nof the field. In total his\nerrors have probably cost\nhim conservatively 70\npoints in points directly\nlost and points gained\nby Hamilton as a direct\nresult of his errors. Given\nthis he should be ahead in\nstandings.\nVettel is a 4-time world\nchampion who is used to\nthe pressure. He won his\nfirst championship having\nbeen only 3rd coming\ninto the final race of the\nseason and had to fight\noff Alonso, considered\none of the greatest drivers\nof the modern era, in a\ntight battle to win his 3rd\nchampionship as well.\nThis is in no so small part\ndown to his relationship\nwith Ferrari. Driving for\nFerrari itself brings on\nmore pressure given the\nprestige and the expecta-tion. On top of this Vettel\ndoesn\u2019t seem to have\nfaith in Ferrari to execute\neffectively to give him the\nbest chance to win. He has\noften called into question\nFerrari\u2019s strategy from\nthe car and attempted\nwithout merit. Ferrari\nhave also made a series of\noperational errors which\nhave cost Vettel. Most\nnotably in Italy where\nVettel\u2019s teammate ended\nup on pole position when\nFerrari could easily have\nmanufactured a situation\nto put Vettel on pole and in\nJapan where Ferrari sent\nVettel out on the wrong\ntyres designed for wet\nconditions when the track\nwas dry enough to use\nslick tyres. Whilst a borderline decision the rest of\nthe field managed to get\nit right, so the question\nis why didn\u2019t Ferrari.\nHamilton has made errors\nas well, particularly by not\nextracting most out of the\ncar in the early part of the\nseason. Mercedes have\nbeen guilty of slipping up\nsuch as in Austria where\nHamilton initially lost the\nlead due to a team error\nand then ultimately retired\nfrom the race with a mechanical problem with his\ncar. However, these errors\nhave been few and far\nbetween and significantly\nthere is a great synergy in\nthe team, with the team\nand Hamilton working\neffectively together to\nbridge their respective\nflaws, such as in Russia\nwhere Hamilton was\nable to overtake Vettel\nfollowing a team error\nwhich allowed Vettel to\nget in front. It is clear that\nHamilton trusts his team\n100% to make the right\ncalls and he therefore only\nhas to focus on driving as\nfast as he can.\nHamilton has all but\nsealedthetitleforthisyear,\nbut it has been a fantastic\nyear in Formula 1. It is encouraging to see 2 teams\nslugging it out having\nseen Mercedes dominate\nsince 2014. Ferrari will\nrue what could have been\nconsidering they\u2019ve had a\ncar fast enough to win the\nchampionship this year\nand will need to build on\nthe success they\u2019ve had\nthis year. With the cars\nbeing redesigned next\nyear to aid overtaking and\nhopefully Ferrari pushing\nMercedes even closer for\nthe title, the 2019 season\nlooks set to be a cracker.\nThrowback to Sebastian Vettel winning the 2009 Japanese GP with RedBull // Wikimedia\nFRIDAY, 12TH\nOCTOBER, 2018 FELIX\nSPORTS sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n39\n\u201cHamilton\nhas outscored\nVettel by 75\npoints in the\nlast 7 races\nand turned an\n8-point deficit\ninto a massive\n67-point\nadvantage\nwith only\n4 races\nremaining\u201d\nto dictate strategy calls\nfrom the cockpit.

Video and\nphotographic evidence\nwhich had been shared in\na WhatsApp group chat\nwere published in The Sun\nin early June. The story\nwas then quickly picked\nup by a number of other\nnational newspapers,\nincluding The Telegraph\nand Independent.\nStudents were captured\nrevealing themselves in\nfront of the Cenotaph,\nclimbing naked into fountains in Trafalgar Square,\nand making 'jokes' about\nMexicans and disabled\npeople. Photographs of\nthe students posing naked\nin front of the Winston\nChurchill statue in Parliament Square, covering\ntheir genitals with\nsombreros also emerged,\nalong with other pictures\nof the team members\nexposing themselves\noutside the Royal Albert\nHall and downing bottles\nof wine.\nAt the time, both the\nCollege and Imperial\nCollege Union described\nthe students' behaviour\nas \"completely unac-ceptable\" and the team\nwas suspended, pending\nfurther investigation. The\nsubsequent hearing was\nheld on 20th\nJune and,\nin addition to the aforementioned punishment,\nfurther sanctions were also\nlevelled against the club.\nThese include removal of\ntour privileges until 31st\nJuly 2020 and revocation\nof the committee and\nclub captain\u2019s authority\nto make independent\nfinancial and social event\ndecisions. All such decisions must be ratified by\nthe Union President until\n31st\nJuly 2020.\nIn a statement given to\nFelix in June on behalf\nof the Union and the\nCollege, a representative\nsaid: \u201cThis alleged behaviour goes against the\nvalues and expectations of\nour student and staff community and is completely\nunacceptable.\u201d\nThe rugby club is\n\"deemed to have brought\nthe Union into disrepute\"\nand further videos showed\nteam members encouraging eachother to defecate\nin public. One student can\nbe seen exposing himself\non a public tube carriage,\nwhilst other videos show\nthe students making offensive comments: in one,\na student in a sombrero\nand poncho clambers\nover a high wall, while\nanother shouts \u201ctypical\nimmigrant\u201d. Another\nvideo allegedly shows a\nstudent trying to dance\nwith a disabled girl in\na nightclub; a comment\non the WhatsApp group\nreads: \u201cPoor girl can\u2019t\neven walk away.\u201d\nIt should be noted that\nthe Rugby club was cooperative during the inves-tigation. In June, a representative of ICURFC told\nFelix: \u201cThe rugby club are\ndeeply regretful about the\nbehaviour which occurred\nin this incident and how it\nreflects on the university\nand members of the club.\u201d\nThe event organisers\nhave been expelled from\nrepresenting the College\nin any sporting compe-tition, for any club with\nBUCS membership until\n31st\nJuly 2019, while the\nother individuals involved\nhave been suspended\nfrom representing the\nCollege, in any sporting\ncompetition, for any club\nwith BUCS membership,\nuntil 31st\nJuly 2019. Any\nbreach of the sanctions\nbefore 31st\nJuly 2020\nwill automatically incur\na complete two-year\ncompetitive ban for the\nentire club, if the incident\nin question is reported to\nthe Union by the club. If\nthe incident in question is\nreported by anyone other\nthan ACC Rugby, the\nclub will incur a four year\ncomplete suspension.\nIt is telling that, despite\nthe event occurring in\nFebruary, nobody in the\nclub thought it important\nto call out this behaviour;\nthis suggests the need for\ncultural reform within\nACC Rugby.\nRugby Club's \"Fiesta Dash\" Point System // The Sun\nFRIDAY, 12TH\nOCTOBER, 2018 FELIX\n4\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n5\nISSUE 1700\nNEWS\nFELIX\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFuture Prospects\nGiven the ever-growing\ndiversity of 21st Century\nBritain and by extension\nthe landscape of higher\neducation, where religion\nhas become a prominent\naspect of many a student\u2019s\nidentity, values and aspi-rations, a panel with focus\non fusing ones religiously\ninformed ethos with their\nacademic and occupational aspirations is likely to\nbe increasingly relevant\nand impactful.

In\naddition, the tour hoped\nto develop the social and\nfun part of our ultimate\ncommunity.

However,\nBlacKkKlansman is far\nfrom a period piece, as\ndirector Spike Lee embellishes what is essentially\na buddy-cop movie into\nan African-American\nnightmare.\nThis is the story of Ron\nStalworth, (John David\nWashington) who was the\nfirst black police officer\nin the Colorado Springs,\nColorado Police Department. When Ron spots\nan advert in the papers\nabout joining the Ku\nKlux Klan, he telephones\nthem pretending to be a\nwhite supremacist. Ron\nsuccessfully convinces\nthem over the phone, and\nwhen it comes to meeting\nthem in person, his colleague Flip Zimmerman\n(Adam Driver) fills in\nas Ron-the-white-supremacist counterpart.\nIt\u2019s quickly evident that\nthe Klan have much\ndarker intentions than the\nseemingly non-violent\nfront, and it\u2019s up to Ron\nto prevent an impending\ndisaster.\nBlacKkKlansman is\nbased on an absurd true\nstory; of course, there are\nsome important dramatic\nliberties that drive the plot\nforward, but the central\nidea of a black man\nbecoming a member of\nthe KKK is preposterous.\nAs serious as the subject\nmatter is, this central\nconceit is an almost\nhumorous one; something\nout of a satirical comedy\nsketch\u2014and the film\ndoesn\u2019t shy away from\nthis at all. There are plenty\nof comical moments that\nthoughout the film that\nprovide breathing space\nthrough, and on the whole\nit does work smoothly\nenough.\nIt\u2019s hardly surprising\nthat Jordan Peele is\ncredited as a producer,\nas his fingerprints are all\nover BlacKkKlansman;\nthe fine balance between\nhumour and horror\nis handled robustly.\nHowever, BlacKkKlansman is surprisingly\ntoothless when it comes\nto the portrayal of racism\nand the KKK. There\u2019s\nplenty of jeopardy, but\nit\u2019s explored in a safe\nenvironment and not as\npowerful as it ought to be.\nHaving said that, there are\nhugely effective moments\nthroughout the film.\nThere is a heart-stopping\nscene involving white\npolicemen misreading a\nsituation that is completely tragic but relieves the\ntension with humour. The\nfinal montage of scenes is\nutterly haunting and the\nparallel-cutting between\nthe Klan and the black\nactivists is poignant.\nWhat you don\u2019t get is\na film about the KKK,\nbut a socially conscious\ncomedy that packs a\npunch.\nBlacKkKlansman is as\nenjoyable a film you could\npossibly get about the Ku\nKlux Klan\u2014which in this\ncase is really enjoyable (if\nthat\u2019s not too politically\nincorrect to say). On\nthe one hand, it juggles\nthe weight of a racially\nvolatile period of history\nand on the other, it ticks\nall the right boxes for the\nlaughs. When you boil it\ndown, its skeleton resembles a simple fish-out-of-water comedy, albeit a\nvery well executed one.\nIt\u2019s not Get Out, but then\nagain, what is?\n\u201cAs enjoyable a film you could possibly get about the Ku Klux Klan\u2014which in this case is really enjoyable\u201d // Universal Pictures\nAdam Driver is having some serious regrets about his Halloween costume this year // Universal Pictures\nFILM\nSung Soo Moon\nFilm Editor\nDir: Spike Lee.

    "content": "Mrs Dalloway Brought to the Stage\n\u201cThe actors\nare fantastic,\nclearly the best\npart of the\nproduction\u201d\n\u201cThe overall\nresult is\nsomething of\na mess, a flurry\nof words that\ndoesn\u2019t quite\ntake shape\u201d\nT\nhis adaptation of\nVirginia Woolf\u2019s\n1925 novel is\nclearly a labour\nof love, and an ambitious\none at that. Mrs Dalloway\nis one of Woolf\u2019s best-known works, and\narguably one of her best.\nIn 1920s London, Clarissa\nDalloway prepares to host\na party for her wealthy\nfriends. On the same day,\nFirst World War veteran\nSeptimus Warren Smith is\nurged by his wife to seek\nhelpforhispsychosisfrom\nSir William Bradshaw, a\nwealthy doctor, and part\nof the upper-class society\nto which Clarissa belongs.\nAlthough the events of\nthe novel take place over\na single summer day, it\nencompasses a myriad\nof characters and perspectives across different\nlocations, with references\nto many events in the\nMrs Dalloway was also\ndeeply personal for\nVirginia Woolf. Septimus\u2019\npost-traumatic stress, his\nvisions of his dead friend\nEvans and the gradual\ndecline of his mental state\nare widely believed to\necho Woolf\u2019s own life.\nVirginia Woolf herself\nsuffered from psychosis\nand there is a hint of her\nexperience in Septimus\nand his struggles.\nWoolf crosses frequently between the\ncharacters, with as much\na focus on their thoughts\nas their actions. And this\nis one of the things that\nis so difficult to translate\nto the stage: the bulk of\nthe novel is taking place\nin the characters\u2019 heads.\nDirector Thomas Bailey\ntries to capture this in his\nadaptation \u2013 the actors\ntalk and interact with each\nother, but then speak their\ncharacters\u2019 inner thoughts\ninto a dictaphone. It\u2019s\nquirky and it works, but\nsoon it starts feeling like\nan overused gimmick.\nThere are other little\ntouches that seem to be\nan attempt to be clever or\nrelevant, such as the use\nof an Oyster Card to represent a ticket and a Metro\nnewspaper, but they don\u2019t\nseem to be part of any\nuniting vision and just feel\nlike odd touches that add\nnothing, and conversely\ndistract from what is hap-pening. The final scene,\na party, is played out as\na press conference, with\nthe actors sitting in a line,\nalternating characters. It\u2019s\none of Thomas Bailey\u2019s\nbest decisions with this\nadaptation as it heightens\nthe feeling of absurdity\nthat pervades the scene.\nOne of the big draws of\nMrs Dalloway is Woolf\u2019s\nlanguage, and playwright\nHal Coase\u2019s adaptation\nof the text maintains her\nflair for the poetic and her\nbeautiful descriptions of\nLondon. It\u2019s a disappointment though that they are\nmerely words read out by\nthe actors and not represented on stage. The set\nis minimal; a single blue\nboard serves as the only\nbackdrop for a great part\nof the play. The bustle of\nLondon, the grandeur of\nClarissa\u2019s life \u2013 there\u2019s too\nmuch that this play asks\nyou to imagine for such\na visual medium. The\nArcola Theatre\u2019s Stage 2\nis also a tiny space, and\none that doesn\u2019t suit this\nproduction at all. Mrs\nDalloway needs distance\nand magnitude. Instead\nit feels cramped and\nclaustrophobic, the actors\ncrossing each other too\noften \u2013 everything feels\ntoo close.\nThe actors, however,\nare fantastic, clearly the\nbest part of the production.\nTheir enthusiasm gives\nyou the sense that this is\na real passion project for\neveryone involved. And\nreally, no cast could have\ndone better than those\nchosen by Thomas Bailey.\nFive actors play over\n20 different characters,\nbut somehow manage to\ncapturetheessenceofeach\none. Claire Perkins is fantastic as the titular charac-ter, at points graceful and\ncharming as the perfect\nhostess, but also capturing\nClarissa\u2019s moments of\nvulnerability. The real\nstand-out performer\nthough is undoubtedly\nClare Lawrence Moody.\nHer takes on Clarissa\u2019s\ncharming old friend Sally\nand the drab Mrs Kilman\nare both excellent and\nintense. When everyone is\non stage, it\u2019s her that your\neyes are drawn to. That\nisn\u2019t to say that the rest\nof the cast are weak \u2013 far\nfrom it. Guy Rhys is a\nconvincing Septimus and\nEmma D\u2019arcy is great as\nhis distraught wife Rezia.\nThe overall result of\nthe play is something of a\nmess,aflurryofwordsthat\ndoesn\u2019t quite take shape.\nThe die-hard Virginia\nWoolf fan will certainly\nfind things to appreciate,\nbut there\u2019s not a great\ndeal here for the casual\nviewer. Mrs Dalloway\njust doesn\u2019t translate well\nto the stage. Hal Coase\u2019s\nwriting isn\u2019t bad, not by\na long shot, but it\u2019s clear\nthis isn\u2019t the medium for\nMrs Dalloway.

    "content": "COMMENT\nFRIDAY, 29TH\nSEPTEMBER, 2017 FELIX\n10\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIs Kanye West going south?\nSome call him the artist of the 21st centruy and some a self obsessed narcissist, but whether\nyou love him or hate him, he\u2019s definitely here to stay.\nCOMMENT\nSung Soo Moon\nFilm Editor\nN\never far from\ncontroversy,\nKanye West\n(now wanting\nto be known as Ye),\nhas hit headlines again,\nprovoking a lot of reaction\nfromtheinternetfollowing\nhis appearance on the\n44th season premiere of\nSaturday Night Live last\nweek. Ye performed his\nsingle \u201cI love it\u201d with\nLil Pump, as they danced\naround on stage dressed\nup as bottled water. Many\ncame to ridicule his set;\nlaughing at him and not\nwith him. At the finale of\nthe programme, Ye broke\ninto a passionate speech\nabout the Make America\nGreat Again hat he\u2019s\nwearing, liberal media\nand having the freedom of\nexpression.\nThis is the man who\nblurted out \u201cGeorge Bush\ndoesn\u2019t care about black\npeople,\u201d at a Hurricane\nKatrina relief concert\nback in 2005, much to\nthe shock of Chris Tucker\nand Mike Myers, who\nwere co-presenting. He\ndoes this to highlight the\nnegative media portrayal\nof African Americans\naffected by the Katrina\nand suggesting that the\nrelief responses to black\npeoples were unfair.While\nthis was early in Ye\u2019s\njourney into blooming\nas the Kanye West he is\nknown as today, we see\nthat this man has no fear\nof controversy\u2014he is not\none to stand in line just\nbecause everyone else is.\nAnd to an extent he has\nsucceeded in what he set\nout to do\u2014Ye wants to\nraise the issue of racism,\nand he does so by making\na provocative statement\nin the vein of clickbait,\nwhich he himself knows\nhow ridiculous it is.\nPerhaps his methods\nare too extreme, as the\ncommon reaction to\nanything he does is anger\nand mockery, but it\u2019s\nadmirable for someone in\nthe public eye to go against\nthe grain. However,\nwe look back at Ye\u2019s\ncomments in amusement,\nas the gravitas of his\nstatement is survived by\nmemes focusing on the\nabsurdity of the situation.\nNow fast track to this\nearlier this year, when\nhe caused a tremendous\namount of backlash\nwith comments praising\nDonald Trump and\nabout how slavery was\na \u201cchoice\u201d. Many in\nthe African American\ncommunity were\noutraged by Ye, forcing\nhim to apologise. This\nis certainly a different\nKanye than in the example\nbefore; this is Kanye the\nsatirical character, Kanye\nthe provocateur, Kanye\nthe absolute meme. It\u2019s\nclear he\u2019s just chatting\na load of shit with the\nsafety net that he is Kanye\nbecause he really doesn\u2019t\ncare about what anyone\nsays. Why would he say\nthese awful things? What\nis the point of pissing\noff a lot of people at the\nsame time? Publicity, of\ncourse, in the way that\nonly Ye knows how. 2018\nhas been a big year for Ye\nso far, releasing several\nsingles, a solo self-titled\nalbum and a collaborative\nproject with Pusha T\ncalled \u2018Kids See Ghosts\u2019.\nAnd coincidentally, all\nhis controversies arose\njust before the releases\nof new music\u2014his latest\nalbum \u2018Yandhi\u2019 was\nplanned to release during\nthe SNL performance,\nbut didn\u2019t. What he is\ndoing is counterintuitive\nbut effective: the modern\nworld is a saturated place\nfull of all sorts of grey\ndetritus that people forget\nabout in times to come\u2014\nbut if one says something\nthat goes against the\npolitics of a people, it\nbecomes something\nthat latches onto the\nconscience of society as\na whole. What a weird\nway to sell an album, is he\ndoing anything more than\nthat?WhatYe is ultimately\ntrying to achieve is to\nimprint his mark on\nthe zeitgeist of today,\nto transcend his rapper\nstatus to something more\nof a historical landmark.\nSo, in being angered by\nhis actions to go vent it\nout on Twitter is exactly\nwhat fuels Ye\u2019s purpose.\nHe frequently compares\nhimself to Leonardo da\nVinci, Steve Jobs, Willy\nWonka, Shakespeare,\nGoogle and many\nmore other culturally\nimportant figures and\nentities. It\u2019s not entirely\npreposterous to label him\nas an artist of the 21st\ncentury, representative\nof the narcissism and\nanti-conformism as a\nconsequence of social\nmedia culture. Ye is one\nof the most influential\nAfrican Americans alive\ntoday and whether he\nfeels a he has duty to serve\nas a spokesperson for\nhis heritage is a different\nmatter altogether.\nHe talks with a brio of a\nmessianic preacher, with\nthe lulling organ chords\nof his song \u201cGhost Town\u201d\nin the backdrop. After\nthanking God for this\nplatform, Ye sings \u201cI feel\nkinda free. I thought this\ncountry said I could be\nme.\u201d Even though most\nof what he said is generic\nand mostly meaningless\ntripe, the fact that it\nprovoked a reaction is\nexactly what Ye set out\nto do. This is the same\nman who just performed\nonstage dressed as a bottle\nof Perrier water; it would\nbe a mistake to take this\nman seriously. His tongue\nis always firmly in his\ncheek. I don\u2019t even think\nhe likes Trump, or even\nunderstands what he\nrepresents. Ye went on\nSNL because he craves\nattention for the sake of it.\nIn the back of all this\nis Ye\u2019s mental health;\nhe implies that he has\nbipolar disorder on the\nalbum cover of Ye and\ngrappled with various\nother issues throughout\nhis career. Obviously, this\nmust be considered when\nassessing his actions\u2014but\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s entirely\nsignificant. Ye is just\ndoing what he feels is\nright; there is no hidden\nagenda as it all comes\nfrom his heart. In truth, I\ndon\u2019t even think he knows\nwhat the hell he\u2019s doing.\nIf you like Ye and the\nstuff he does, then please\ncontinue to live your life\npeacefully. If you don\u2019t,\nthere\u2019s still no good reason\nto get upset by him.\nKanye West being Kanye West// \u201cI Like It\u201d music video\n\u201cThe fact that\nhe can provoke\na reaction is\nentirely what\nYe set out to\ndo\u201d\nIf Trump embodies\nthe voice of the\ndisenfranchised right,\nthen Ye could be\nconsidered an equal and\nopposite, representing\nthe disenfranchised\nleft\u2014using freedom of\nthought and speech as a\ncounterargument to his\ncontroversial comments.\nHe claims to have been\n\u201cbullied backstage\u201d at\nSNL for wearing the\nMAGA hat and calls for\n\u201cdebate not diatribe\u201d\nin the ongoing tussle\nbetween the right and the\nleft in modern America.\nIn the closing moments of\nthe show, Ye talks about\nhow 90% of news, LA,\nNew York, writers and\nrappers are liberal, and\nhow there\u2019s no balance\u2014\nan almost Thanos-esque\nstatement, while saying\nhe can\u2019t be told what to\ndo because when he puts\nhis \u201cSuperman cape\u201d on.\n\n"

So naturally, you\ntag your friends saying,\n\u201cwe should go!\u201d, knowing\nwell it\u2019s probably not\ngoing to happen because\nsomething always comes\nup \u2013 your bank account\nis a little broken after\nall those nights out, one\nof you is too busy at the\nlibrary, or like us, maybe\nyou just prefer to spend\nyour time napping.\nHowever, one day, my\nfriend and I decided to\nset out on a quest to try\neach and every dessert\nplace we came across\non social media \u2013 no\nbetter way to spend your\nstudent finance, right? We\ndecided to hit up the capital\u2019s foodie hotspot first\n\u2013 Westfield London. From\nthe famous Mr. Pretzel\ncinnamon sugar pretzels\nto bubble waffles to\nice-cream and pancakes,\nthis place was absolutely\npacked and buzzing on\nyummy, picturesque\ndesserts \u2013 all just ready\nfor us to eat and eat and\neat!\nFirst place on our\ndessert hit list was Naked\nDough. Located on the\nfirst floor, this little cookie\ndough cafe stall could not\npossibly be missed with\nits lively setup and bright,\nvibrant display. The\ncookie dough flavours had\nusbothbaffled,withsucha\nwide range to choose from\nfor the tubs and dough\ncones they did, including\nlotus biscuits, mud bath\n(aka death by chocolate),\nNutella, \u2018Unicorn Food\u2019\n(marshmallows and sprin-kles), and a very tempting\nsalted caramel and\nhoneycomb. There was\nalso plenty of toppings\nwhich you could mix-and-match. The smallest size,\ncosting just under \u00a35,\nwe thought a bit pricey\nbut seeing the massive\nportion a girl before us\nreceived, we changed our\nminds (do not get a larger\nsize than the normal, or\nyou will die). Though all\nof that was fantastic, we\nwere there for actually\neating the food, and\nwith no due hesitation,\nwe decided to order the\nbiggest thing we could\nfind \u2013 the Dough Freak.\nTwo scoops of mouth-wa-teringly soft ice-cream\nstuffed in-between two\nscoops of *arguably* the\nbest cookie dough to ever\nexist, plus free unlimited\ntoppings. One taste of it\nand we were questioning\nreality \u2013 surely this was\nwhat actual heaven felt\nlike?\nAfter how successful\nour first Westfield trip\nwas, we had high expectations for our next dessert\nadventure, and naturally\nwe had to hit up Bubble\non Waffle, one of the most\nInstagrammed dessert\nplacesin London \u2013 but was\nit going to live up to the\nbar set by Naked Dough?\nThough we didn\u2019t have as\nmany flavours to choose\nfrom, we still had quite\nthe predicament because\nwho could really choose\nbetween a heavenly\nhazelnut Ferrero Rocher,\nstrawberry shortcake\ngoodness and a blissful\nbanana split? Also, I\nmean, who could resist\nthe combination of a hot\nwaffle with the cooling ice\ncream centre? At roughly\n\u00a37 per waffle, this was\nfairly expensive, but we\nwere hoping it would be\nworth it. Unfortunately,\nthe taste and practicality\ndid not match the waffles\u2019\nlooks; the waffle was\nsoggy and began falling\napart after a few minutes,\nand the ice-cream didn\u2019t\nquite taste of the flavour\nit was meant to be. All in\nall, a bit bland really, but\nat least we got some pretty\ncool photos out of it \u2013 you\nwin some, you lose some,\neh?\nNot fazed by the shortcomings of the bubble\nwaffle, the last trip was to a\ndonut store in Soho called\nDoughnut Time.

As we got\nnearer, our first glance at\nthe display made all our\ndoubts disappear. From\nPercyPigtoOreotoM&M\ndonuts, every donut had a\n\u2018theme\u2019, both aesthetics\nand flavour wise.

The time for change is now.\nCOMMENT\nSaym Hussein\nComment Writer\nI\nam still angry. After\nover 2 years of\npolitics surrounding\nBrexit, nothing good\nat all has happened. Our\ncountry is fractured, major\nissues with domestic\npolicy haven\u2019t been dealt\nwith, and our government\nis a puppet of the far-right.\nIt is about time that we\ncome to terms with the\nfact that Brexit just isn\u2019t\nworth it.\nFrom the start of this\nprocess, Brexit has been\nframed as being a middle\nfinger to the establishment\nbecause government\nwas not working for the\nworking class. However,\nmany of the frustrations\nthat regular people care\nabout aren\u2019t actually\ncaused by EU policies.\nIssues like income\ninequality, housing,\neducation, healthcare,\nimmigration, transport,\npoverty, homelessness,\netc. were all dependent on\nthe policy of the Tories\u2019\ndeep austerity, i.e British\ndomestic policy. I believe\nthat people were genuinely fed up of 6 years of\ncuts and needed an outlet,\nhence why we saw such\na close result in the 2014\nScottish independence\nreferendum. Wealth is not\nevenly spread across the\ncountry, and as a result,\ncreates a sentiment where\npeople feel left behind\nby the growth of London\nand the economy. With\nLondon alone accounting\nfor 24.8% of the UK\u2019s\nGDP (as of 2015) the\nand the OECD saying\nthat \u201cThe highest levels\nof income inequality in\nEurope are reached in the\nUnited Kingdom and the\nBaltic States.\u201d, we need\nto open the discussion\nsurrounding income inequality in and implement\npolicies to combat this,\nrather than blaming the\nEU for all our issues.\nThis severe inequality in\nthe UK, I believe, set the\npretext as to why people\nwere willing to test the\nboundaries of British\npolitics and see if such a\nradical idea like Brexit\ncould come into fruition,\nall in an effort to make\ntheir voices heard.\nHowever, what makes\nme genuinely upset is\naimlessness in which\nthis electoral potential\nwas aimed at. Instead of\na grassroots movement\nwhere we could hold\ncrony capitalists accountable and demand reform\nthat works for all people,\nvia party and general elec-tions, the public anger was\ncapitalised by the far-right\nof this country for their\nown extreme political\nagenda, then manipulated\nby the Tories (the source\nof deep austerity over the\nprevious 6 years) for political points. \u201cBlame the\nEU\u201d we were told. Many\nwere convinced that the\nEU was the source of all\nour domestic struggles\nand that being British\nand European weren\u2019t\ncompatible, all in an effort\nto \u201ctake back control\u201d and\nreturn the \u2018glory days\u2019 of\nthe empire. This is political talk for supremacy\nlike the times of British\ncolonialism where Britain\nused the tactic of divide\nand rule to assert its\nAnglo-Saxon dominance\non the world and perpetuate a narrative of \u2018us\nagainst them\u2019. The thing\nis, history is cyclical. We\nhave heard these racist\nassertions 50 years ago\nwith the migrants of\nUganda, India, Pakistan,\nand the Caribbean.\nHas our country been\ninvaded? Has our country\nlost its British identity?\nHas our country become\na wasteland? I don\u2019t think\ngration, but as a British\nperson of colour from an\nimmigrant family, I can\u2019t\nhelp but see the blatant underlying racism and desire\nfor British supremacy. It\u2019s\nthe 21st century and the\npolitical currency is diplomacy and soft power,\nnot annexation of land\nthe oppression of people.\nOur government seems\nto have lost any form of\nreasonable diplomatic\nskill and is, instead, on a\ndelusional pursuit towards\nBritish \u201cindependence\u201d\nand an assertion on\nglobal trade \u2013 almost like\ncolonial times. Those\nwho believe that Britain\nwill realistically remain a\ntop 5 economy are delu-sional. The reality is that\nalthough the sun never\nused to set on the British\nempire, today the United\nKingdom is a small island\noff the coast of Europe\nwith moderate population\nof 65 million people and a\nlove of tea. PwC\u2019s report\non the long view of global\neconomies predicts that\nUK\u2019s economy will be\novertaken by Mexico,\nRussia, Indonesia and\nIndia. That is just a matter\nof fact that we have to\ndeal with. So, this notion\nthat Britain can \u2018become\nindependent again\u2019 and\nassert its dominance just\nlike we used to 200 years\nago is just farcical.\nFrom an economic\nperspective, Brexit again\ndoesn\u2019t really solve our\ndomestic issues. It is just a\nploy to loosen regulations\n(which I must mention,\nkeep us safe!) for selfish\neconomic gain. Brexit in\nthis perspective is a compromise of our safety for\nfew more pounds.Arecent\nexample of how this could\nimpact us is seen by the\nTheresa May in happier times// Flickr\n\u201cBritish culture\nhas developed\nour country\nto become\na global\nand cultural\nexporter\u201d\nso. In fact, I argue that\nBritish multiculturalism\nhas actually developed\nour country to become the\nglobal hub and cultural\nexporter that it is today.\nSo why should we treat\ntoday\u2019s fearmongering of\nthe \u201cimmigration crisis\u201d\nany different to the past?\nWhy does it deserve any\nvalidity?\n2 years down the rabbit\nhole of Brexit, I think it is\nimportant to realise that\nwe are at a stage were\nthe far-right are now\nmoderates and extreme\npolitical talk is normal-ised. Whenever I hear\ntalk about \u201ctaking back\ncontrol\u201d, it may be framed\nas a reasonable argument\nfor controlling immi\u201cIssues like\ninequality,\neducation,\npovert,\nhomelessness\nare the results\nof austerity\u201d\nCOMMENT\nFRIDAY, 12TH\nOCTOBER, 2018 FELIX\n9\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\ndevastating disaster of\nGrenfell, Tower where\n72 innocent lives where\ntaken because of a lack\nof regulation surrounding\nfire safety in cladding,\nwhich essentially allowed\nflammable cladding to be\nplaced on Grenfell tower.\nAfter Brexit, imagine\nwhat deregulation could\ndo to public safety, and\nthe safety of goods we\nuse. Cheaper materials\nfor higher profit margins,\nfor example, would\nmean that consumer and\nenvironmental standards\nsuffer as a result. Of\ncourse, there should be\nbalance in regulations, as\nwith everything, but as\na whole, EU regulations\nsurrounding goods and\nservices have benefitted\nour safety and experiences at the expense of large\ncorporations who only\ncare about their shareholders and their stock market\nprice. Brexiteers who\nclaim that controlling our\nown regulations would be\nbetter for striking trade\nto gain the most and can\nafford to switch to private\nhealthcare and education.\nIt is for this colonialist\nand economic selfishness\nthat I say that Brexit is a\npolitical project for the\nfar-right British elite,\nframed as a stand against\nthe establishment which\nthey are very much a\npart of. Look at us now,\nTheresa May \u2013 the\nembodiment of British\nelitism \u2013 is the prime\nminister, and her domestic\npolicies are very much\nsimilar to the Cameron\nestablishment that was de-monised during the 2016\nreferendum. The truth\nis that for real change to\nhappen in this country, we\nneed a shake-up in traditional British government\nand to elect people that\ngenuinely care about the\nbetterment of the whole\nof the United Kingdom\nand all its different and\nbeautiful people.\nBut for now, we are\nlooking at a bleak, not\ntoo distant future where a\ndisastrous no-deal Brexit\nis likely, causing the\nfar-right to be bolstered,\nhate crimes to increase,\nand civil unrest to take\nplace across the country.\nBrexit was sold to us on\nlies, fearmongering, and\n\u201cI am in favour\nof a second\nreferendum\nto reset the\npolitical\ndeadlock\u201d\n\u201cEU\nregulations\nsurrounding\ngoods and\nservices have\nbenefitted our\nsafety\u201d\na predated colonialist\nideology. The vote was\nwon on a close majority\nof 1.9% - possibly swayed\nby the overspending by\nthe Vote Leave campaign.\nLondon, Scotland, and\nNorthern Ireland are being\npulled from the EU out\nof their own will. People\nvoted for change, but no\none voted for this.\nThat is why I am\nin favour of a second\nreferendum to reset the\ndeadlocked politics that\nwe are suffering. The\nEU is not perfect, there\nis a reasonable argument\nfor Brexit. However, we\nare geographically not\ngoing anywhere and the\nEU member states are\nour neighbours, therefore\nthe best way to trade and\nreform the structure of\nour relationships is within\nthe European Union. We\nneed to have honest and\nfrank debate about Brexit\nand about immigration\n\u2013 because it is a real\nconcern for some people\nand should not be wholly\ndismissed as racist. But\nno, a second referendum is\nnot \u201cgoing against the will\nof the people\u201d; it is the\ndemocratic choice make.\nPeople can change their\nminds, and democracy\nshould allow it, especially\nnow that we know what\nBrexit actually means. I\nam a part of a generation\nthat currently stands to\nlose everything for choice\nthat I didn\u2019t make because\nof an elderly nostalgia\nfor the British Empire.\ndeals and boosting the\neconomy are often the\nsame Tories that are able\nto influence policy to their\nown economic advantage.\nA post-Brexit Britain\nwould have to become\nlow-regulation, low-tax\ncountry to attract investment and strike trade\ndeals. The notion that\nnot paying into EU will\nsave us money that can be\ninvested in public services\nis nonsense. As a result of\nBrexit, cuts in tax-funded\nservices, like NHS and\neducation, would affect\nthe poorest the most,\nwhereas the wealthiest\nechelons of society stand\nTwo years on from the\nreferendum, the 18, 19\nand 20 years olds of today\ndeserve a chance to voice\ntheir opinion, not for sake\nof partisan politics but for\nthe sake of democracy\nitself. The Tories are currently pursuing an agenda\nof electoral repression by\nincreasing restrictions for\nvoting, and redrawing and\nreducing constituencies \u2013\nwhich disproportionally\naffects young people,\nethnic minority voters,\nlower income voters,\nand reduces the seats of\nopposition parties \u2013 all\nin an effort to bolster the\nconservative majority\nand retain their grasp on\npower. We should not\nstand for this. When far-right politics is dominating the political spectrum\nand Theresa May\u2019s\nGovernment wants to\nrestrict our say in British\npolitics, we don\u2019t have the\nluxury to be passive about\npolitics.\nTheresa May is not happy// Flickr\nFelix is recruiting!\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you!
